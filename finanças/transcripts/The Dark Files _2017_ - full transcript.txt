D-Day, June 1944. The beginning of the end of the deadliest conflict in human history. Before the war, the American military is ranked the 17th largest in the world. By the time it ends... it's number one. Yet in its quest to remain the newly minted pre-eminent global superpower, the United States government engages in a pattern of covert behavior that sees it experiment on its own citizens. Its purpose, increasing America's military might. The CIA does not deny that the experiments took place. The depth and breadth of these government programs is beyond our wildest imagination. Many Americans would prefer not to remember the syphilis study at Tuskegee. And leave many to wonder what other government secrets remain undiscovered? In today's climate, where everything is viewed with skepticism, the truly evil is easily hidden. To penetrate this sinister world, a trio of inspired citizens is ready to find out, to look beyond the surface, imagining the unimaginable. With a hope to uncovering the truth of America's dark files. Montauk Point, the eastern most tip of Long Island. Just three hours from the big city and bright lights of Manhattan. Yet a world unto itself. Home to a one of a kind radar tower, a sprawling park called Camp Hero and an endless collection of unnerving rumors. Christopher Garetano grew up on the Island. I started hearing all these strange and bizarre stories about Montauk. A multitude of things that were anomalous and not normal. Every 12 seconds the radar tower'd rotate and there would be animals freaking out and people getting headaches and bad dreams. And you know people's electronic equipment would go haywire. There would be you know, covert military vans, helicopters have been around the perimeter. And of course the Montauk monster. The government states this site is a shuttered military base that once protected Americans. But there are also claims that within Camp Hero's concrete fortresses, lie the remains of a deep government conspiracy. When I was a kid, my summers would be spent in Montauk. Garetano's history with Camp Hero goes back to 1983. Exactly two years after the base is shut down. I was maybe eight years old. And I was walking down the beach with my uncle and my father looking for shells and I was walking a little further away from my uncle and my father and I saw these giant iron, round, kind of spherical things with spikes sticking out of them. And that's when this military personnel came out and he told us to go the other way, can't go any further. A decommissioned base that still secures its perimeter, Garetano and his father find the contradiction puzzling. That moment was extremely important because that's when my curiosity began. I thought if the base is closed down, why is it so tightly guarded? What are they hiding? He makes over 100 trips here in the ensuing years to find out. And he isn't alone in his curiosity. Over the years, swarms of people breach the tower's gated perimeter. Hoping to get below ground and search for answers to Montauk's bizarre mysteries before being chased away by its tight security. In 1992, years of rumors, speculation, and innuendo find a common voice when a book is published called, The Montauk Project. The Montauk Project at its core is a collection of everything you could possibly think of in the world of paranormal and conspiratorial ideas. Children being kidnapped in a secret government mind control project. Then there's aspects of the alien thing and time travel and all of these different ideas that are integrated with this idea of mind control. Preston Nichols is the author and architect ofThe Montauk Project. And according to people who knew him in the 1980s, a brilliant scientist with a wide following. His book provides a suite of explanations to Montauk's many legends. And further feeds the rumor mill. Were children pulled off the streets of surrounding communities and used in mind control experiments at Camp Hero? Did this base and its purported underground once serve as a venue for time travel? Why did the military depart this place with such abandon? And why is it's former nerve center still off limits? What is the American government hiding? And is Camp Hero the site of yet another official government cover up? As Garetano tries to answer these questions over the years, he immerses himself in Montauk, a personal investigation that becomes a decade long obsession. And he documents it all on film. It was after I learned about MKUltra and it was after I learned about government programs that actually happened that I became obsessed. It was like everything you learned in science fiction is now real. I actually started to believe what was being told to me. Garetano compiles his years of footage into a 2015 documentary called theMontauk Chronicles. Allowing Nichols and his supporters to tell their story in detail. But Garetano believes the Montauk mystery goes much deeper than that. And he thinks there's evidence to be found that will either prove or disprove this story once and for all. What keeps me up at night regarding this whole thing is that I believe at least some of it is true. And that I'd like to prove it. I think it's really important that I either put it to rest or we prove that it- it happened. A fresh active investigation into the incredible allegations at Montauk. To assist him, Garetano is bringing in two men who offer a wide array of experiences from opposite ends of the spectrum. My name is Barry Eisler, I spent three years in a covert position with the CIA. These days I write novels full time, political thrillers. Eisler's time at the Agency afforded him a unique look inside the belly of the American government. Based on my own experiences in the CIA, and based on the public record, you can see the sort of group think that would take hold and allow people to suspend what they would otherwise consider to be their ethical base, their own morality in the name of say national security and wind up doing some terrible things. To counter Eisler, Garetano finds a well-known skeptic. My name's Steve Volk. I'm a contributing editor at Discover Magazine, a writer at large at Philadelphia Magazine, and a contributor to the Washington Post. Respected in Philly as a hard hitting crime reporter, a skeptical Volk is known nationally as the author ofFringe-ology a critically acclaimed work of non-fiction that attempts to explain away the paranormal. Usually people stay away from something this fringe-y. But you've gotta leave the door open to a story like this. When there's so many people who believe it who are orienting their lives around it, it's up to the rest of us I think to engage. Garetano knows both men have at least one thing in common. A deep knowledge of the American government's pattern of questionable behavior in the name of geopolitical superiority. The reason that Americans are so interested in conspiracy theories is that conspiracies happen. Look at real historical incidents like the Tuskegee syphilis experiments. It's one of the most shameful episodes in American history. The Tuskegee syphilis study ran from 1932 to 1972. It's purpose? Observe the natural progression of untreated syphilis in 600 African-American men in Alabama. Under the guise that these men would receive free healthcare from the U.S. government. They were just allowed to suffer and die from the disease so that the scientists could just observe what happens if you have untreated syphilis. What the United States government did was shameful and I am sorry. Sounds like something out of a movie but it's real. Real... only because it was proven so by whistleblowers 40 years after it began. Tuskegee is one example of many in American history. What we've seen ever since World War II is not any kind of downsizing of these programs but their continued growth. In the councils of government, we must guard against the military industrial complex. The phrase the military industrial complex, the idea is this, it's a synergistic relationship between the military on the one hand and the private corporations that supply the military with its hardware on the other. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. The more we learn about history, I am forced to conclude that the U.S. government is perfectly capable of doing barbarous stuff in the name of science, in the name of national security. So, if we're going to dispassionately, logically, and as objectively as possible evaluate allegations of human experimentation at Camp Hero in Montauk, we can't do that in an historical vacuum. Yet the question remains: Is there any hard proof to show that unspeakable behavior occurred at Camp Hero in Montauk? Is yet another government conspiracy ready to be uncovered? Day one of the investigation. Arrival at Camp Hero and Eisler and Volk's first times seeing the radar tower in person. From here it looks like some alien thing. Yeah, it look ominous from here. Once a military base, the site today consists of over 400 acres of wooded parkland. The radar tower is situated almost dead center within the park. There's that big old beast. It's a ghost of World War II you know. A total relic. And is ground zero for the conspiracy theory. This is where they say allegedly underneath the ground everything was happening. And again, you know, if you listen to all the people that tell this story that say they were part of it, they're not saying it happened above ground. I mean, very few things did in regard to the Montauk Project. They're saying it happened beneath the ground, deep beneath the ground. Beneath the ground at Camp Hero, if the rumors are true, buried under the radar tower, exists the most complex and powerful secret laboratory in U.S. history. And it's purpose is mind bending. Using the radars powerful radio frequencies, scientists get inside the human mind. Tapping into consciousness and reading people's thoughts. Then applying technology supposedly given to them by aliens, these scientists create what becomes known as the Montauk chair which projects these thoughts to a remote location. But this chair proves eminently functional. It also is said to have opened up a vortex for time travel. The official word is there's nothing underground. But I really think there's something to hide there. I think it's really important that we try and break through the cement. That we look deep inside the base. If we can look underground 60, 70 feet, it's a way we can prove or disprove the project. If we can find something the country would have a whole new perspective on our history. Is the truth buried below Camp Hero? According to locals and others who snuck inside before the park service secured its exposed entrances, there exists a complex system of interconnected, multi-level tunnels. Yet the blueprints of the base made available to the public show no interconnectivity at all. So much of this story hinges on the idea that there's tunnels and secret rooms, this vast underground network underneath Montauk. So, as part of our investigation, we applied for a permit from Camp Hero to go underground. Why is this separate from the rest of it? And they denied that request. I've seen a lot of different shows where people go into abandoned buildings or hazardous places and as long as there's safety measures taken, people do it. Why can't we go into Camp Hero? There's something they don't want us to know. a scenic hamlet in Long Island's luxurious Hamptons. To others, the sight of an deep government conspiracy. Most locals will automatically dismiss this as a joke or as a hoax. But it's like you living next door to John Wayne Gassy for 30 years thinking he's this wonderful, jovial man who couldn't possibly hurt anybody. But under your nose for 30 years he's been killing people and burying them underneath the crawlspace and that's right next door. Filmmaker Christopher Garetano has spent a decade investing Camp Hero and has invited former Central Intelligence Agency operative Barry Eisler, a diligent truth seeker and journalist and author Steve Volk, a healthy skeptic to join him in looking into the Montauk Project's claims. Rumors and allegations about what went on at Montauk range from the easy to believe I think to the much more difficult to believe. The Montauk Conspiracy includes everything from aliens, time travel, mind control, to Nazis, brainwashing, implanted memories and erased memories. Gonna be fun to dig into it. Yet according to the official record, Camp Hero is something else entirely. Originally commissioned by the United States Army during World War II, this remote ocean side camp is disguised as a fishing village with two behemoth 16 inch, 66 foot guns protecting New York from German U-boats. In 1958 during the Cold War, Camp Hero becomes an integral part of America's semi-automatic ground environment system, aka, Sage Radar. The base is transferred to the United States Air Force. Montauk's tower is the mother station to a series of smaller manned radars sitting on platforms in the ocean along the East Coast. This iron shield provides U.S. forces with an extra 30 minutes of warning time in the event of an incoming Soviet nuclear attack. Only 12 of these massive tower systems were installed across the United States. Today, the tower at Montauk is the only one left standing and is a national historic monument. But it has also become a monument to possibly the darkest alleged government conspiracy in U.S. history. One of the earliest spokesman of this legend was a man named Al Bielek. Garetano meets Bielek in 2006 while working on his documentary. In the late 80s, Bielek comes forward with recovered memories of working as a scientist on the Philadelphia Experiment. A forerunner to the Montauk Project. The Philadelphia Experiment is an incident in which the U.S. government is alleged to have tried to deploy a new radar cloaking technology on a Navy ship called the Eldridge, inadvertently having sent this ship in some sort of time travel. While the story states that the Eldridge traveled only a few seconds through time Bielek claims that he was on the ship and it actually traveled 40 years into the future, ending up in Montauk. We could go across galaxies to the other side of the galaxy which was longer than 25.000 light years in two or three seconds. As the men wind their way through Camp Hero to an area Bielek claims is a hot spot, they come across a man who appears to be some kind of park worker. We have a question, you're working with the Army Corps of Engineers sir? Well that's our client. So what exactly are they doing today? They just you know 'cause this used to be a former military base. We just do surveys to see if there's any other hazardous materials still out there. Are you aware of the conspiracy surrounding this base. Actually I got more on my team that's actually working up there at the radar tower right now and that's supposed to be the main room where, there's supposed to be a bunker beneath where they had all the time travel experiments and that kind of weird stuff. So I'm not really sure, I'm not positive. I'm really low on the totem pole here. I'm just out, I'm just a field botanist. I don't know the exact details. The trio wrap up their spontaneous interview. You guys you hearing all the drilling and everything to our left? See over there, that's where they're working right there. Yeah. According to Steve the botanist. An interview raises more questions than it answers. After the botanist brings up a supposed underground that allegedly once served as a venue for time travel experimentation. Not that I'm a conspiracy theorist, it's just, we filed for a permit several months ago, they knew we were gonna be here. I'm mean it could be a coincidence, but it's just kind a weird that three months ago give or take these guys knew we were gonna be out here doing some kind of investigation. And at the same time we arrive, they've got the Army Corps of Engineers out here. - Right. Oh man, that's beautiful. Yeah, it's gorgeous. It's very hard for me to have dark thoughts looking out at this. The men arrive at a bluff on the park's eastern most edge, about a mile away from the radar tower and some 75 feet above the Atlantic Ocean. This is the location Al Bielek claims is linked by Montauk's underground tunnel system. You walk into the entrance of this thing in the, opening in the wall when it's operating. You get sucked in, you come out the other end, get dumped on the ground sort of. And uh... 125.000 light years and you're on another planetary system on the opposite side of the galaxy. He said that these strange energetic devices that generated power for a time travel device. It was partially buried deep in the soil. It's right out here where you're looking is where Al Bielek said the USS Eldridge appeared briefly in 1983 and then disappeared right here. Chris's position seems to be that is where the time travel aspect of the Montauk Experiment would have taken place. Somewhere underground by some unknown technology. I know that it's a theoretical scientific possibility for sure, but I also know that as a practical matter we don't really know that we'll ever actually be able to do it and send people backward or forward in time. If the skeptic Volk agrees that time travel is a theoretical scientific possibility, couldn't it also be possible that Al Bielek and others in the Montauk Project found a scientific answer? Okay, let's talk about the time travel thing. If you rewind back 100 years, we thought we knew everything. All of the technology and things we've discovered between now and then we once science fiction. So why is it so unbelievable or unfathomable to consider all of the other more elaborate aspects of this whole story? If what Bielek claims is true, then underneath this remote bluff exists time travel capabilities. Could there be a way to peer into the rock and soil and see evidence of such structures without breaking the terms of the park permit? If such a capability exists, would there be proof of a network of interconnected tunnels to and from the radar tower? To find a potential link between the two, the men return to the beating heart of the conspiracy. We check with the people in charge and they say absolutely no way and we're not allowed to go. They're up our asses the whole time. Not letting us go anywhere. Alright, so let's hop the fence. It's such a temptation... so appealing. Each of the men know that just a brief glimpse beyond these secure gates may provide the answer to this mystery, but if they're caught, a permit revocation and possible arrest. So many times I've been over this fence. We get so used to it that we don't even care anymore, it's like Eric look, anyone coming. Nope, jump the fence, go, run, grab our gear. I have footage of us hopping this fence many times. You just step on this chain over here. It's moving around a lot, are you sure? Excuse me, you guys gotta come outta there. The Montauk Project, An alleged government conspiracy, that claims below this former military base at the tip of New York, a covert government program was housed that saw experiments in time travel and mind control. If proven true, this tale speaks to the worst of man, and the darkest depths of the American government. The men know that getting into the radar tower, an enclosed area where no one is permitted access, is key to their investigation. Excuse me. You guys gotta come out of there. But the park service has only granted the group a restricted permit for filming. They aren't allowed to dig into the ground, or breach the tower's gated perimeter. Why couldn't we have certain regulations just to go past the gates, film around, stay on the grass, stay on the path? We're not even allowed to do that. So he's taking photos of us? You're not at all suspicious of these guys, you think they're just normal maintenance dudes? Tight security or simply maintenance workers going about their business? Since Garetano made his documentary in 2015, he's cataloged a variety of strange occurrences, and met a number of characters who have led him deeper into this incredible story. A lot of people have been coming forward in the past two years, claiming they were part of the Montauk Project. Many of those speaking out claim to be subjects of the most obscene part of the legend, that thousands of at-risk children were pulled off the streets of neighboring cities, taken below ground at Camp Hero, beaten and abused, and then programmed into super soldiers. That the government, through abduction and then mind control, created an army of super secret sleeper cells, to be called into action on command. This group is now collectively called the Montauk Boys. There's a gentleman, his name is James Bruce. It's an alias, you'll soon meet him. James Bruce, a subject in Garetano's film on the alleged conspiracy, and a self-proclaimed Montauk Boy, one of the super soldiers. He said that house back there, he was brought into and given a large amount of hallucinogens, and he even suggested that Timothy Leary was here at one point. Timothy Leary? Yeah. Timothy Leary was designing and administering LSD in that house over there, which he dubbed the acid house. Could the noted psychologist, writer and psychedelic advocate Timothy Leary, have been in Montauk during the Project? If so, it's the first time Volk is hearing about it. Does that make any sense to you? Does it make sense that Leary was part of this? Why not? I mean, he was a big advocate for LSD, he knew a lot about it, why not? I don't know he was into forcibly administering it to children, however. Again, if you know about all of these other programs, this stuff isn't far-fetched. I'm referring to MKUltra. I would treat MKUltra as one example of how far the U.S. government is willing to go in secret, and how far it's able to go in secret, in the name of national security. Revealed to the public in the mid-1970s by a congressional committee called the Church Commission, MKUltra is a CIA program that runs for 20 years, starting in 1953. Its purpose? The CIA conducts experiments on human subjects, intended to test and develop drugs to be used in interrogations and torture, in order to weaken individuals, to force confessions using mind control. MKUltra consisted of more than 130 research programs which took place in prisons, hospitals, and universities all over the United States. Now Alfred Bielek and Preston Nichols both claim that there's a direct connection between MKUltra and Montauk. There's even a connection, they say, between the Paperclip Scientists, even far back as the Third Reich. Also known as Operation Paperclip, this program is officially sanctioned by America after World War II, and includes more than 1.600 Germans. Project Paperclip, a secret U.S. government program to recruit Nazi scientists and other Nazi party members, many of whom were engaged in the worst atrocities, to bring them to the United States, to whitewash their war crimes, give them new identities, then exploit them for their scientific and intelligence value. Paperclip, MKUltra, Tuskegee, once the unthinkable, now proven facts in the historical record. And some say, a clear pattern showing possible direct links back to Montauk. Even though we've been able to prove all of these other projects, we've not been able to prove that it's happened at Montauk. You'd have to say like okay, okay, the government did all these mind control experiments, but they would never do them in Montauk, New Work. That would be crazy. Still, for the journalist Volk, hard proof connecting Leary to Montauk, and tying Montauk to past government programs, will require corroborating evidence, not just a knowledge of American history. Public Information Office, this is Maureen, Can I help you? Hey, this is Steve Volk and I'm a writer working on a project I was hoping you might be able to help me with. To authenticate claims of time travel, child abduction, mind control, acid testing, and the rest of the Montauk Project's legend, the men cast a wide research net. So Mike, what year did you start working there? I arrived at Montauk Air Force Station in February of 1978 and I completed my tour there in June of 1980. I'm wondering if I could just sort of get a raw total number of kids reported missing, by year, dating back to from 19, this is a big request, I know. From 1960 to about 1990. My name is James Bruce. It's an alias, obviously. Not that the powers that be don't know who I am. I was 13, I think I was, when we moved here. You had a parent in the Air Force? Yeah, I had a step-dad that was in the Air Force. There are people now who say, look, this base has always had this sort of secret clandestine history, 'cause it was made to look like a fishing village, and the implication is that even, even the people who lived here didn't know it was really a military site. You're saying that's just not true. Well, we know there were 16-inch cannons in the bluffs. So, unless you're gonna kill the fish with a 16-inch shell. Was it like a high security there? What was it like the day you arrived? It was real dark. There was no security at the gate. Anybody could've drove on. So there was no security, he drove right up onto the base where supposedly this top secret is happening. I will say the first time that I drove up to Camp Perry, the farm in Williamsburg, Virginia, for CIA paramilitary training, your first impression is guard post, armed guards. It was incredibly secure, right? Yeah. I did hear rumors of it. Even when you were living here? When I was living here, yeah. You heard rumors of it, but you never really saw anything happening. Back between '78 and '80, you heard rumors that there were time travel experiments going on? Yes, I did hear about that, yeah. That was long before any books were written. Yeah. You know, the darkest part of this whole story that people tell is that it involved kidnapping kids around the area. I mean, if it was happening, I didn't know about. I did never heard about it. It was also experiments to mind squash because they had specific types of acid to where you could read each other's thoughts. And then you would say it back to you and you would say, holy, how did you know that? 'Cause you could actually be on the same wavelength. What do you think they were using you for? What was the purpose of this experiment? They wanted me to calm down to teleport in this chair, 'cause it's a teleportation device. It pulls, rips your soul right out of your body, sends it through the wire and then you could fly through space as your body's laying in the chair. Good to see you, man. The men conduct 25 plus interviews with people connected to Montauk, and receive a range of denials, innuendo, and speculation. But it isn't until they meet a local, named Brian Minnick, that they may have finally found what they've been searching for. Me and my friends we'd explore, that's all we did. Collecting anything I could find. Did you bring some stuff for us to look at? This is actually an entrance to the basement. You'd walk along this trench down steps, and there's a door over there that you'd go into the basement with. I was honestly blown away by that footage. Every single thing that Brian brought to us, challenges the public statement. Now here is something that really did surprise me. Hamptons local, Brian Minnick has spent 30 years traversing the grounds at Camp Hero in New York. Filming his trips and collecting photos and other documentation related to this mysterious former military base. A base that some people assert, served as a cover for a clandestine government program of mind control and time travel experimentation. I went there when I was probably like, 11 years old in 1987 with some family friends and we made our way into one of the bunkers. I didn't start exploring it until I found out about the book. Then, at that point we were just trying to get underground. What was the most compelling piece of evidence or the most compelling that you've experienced in all the years of you observing Camp Hero. There was a lot of strange things and the sum total of all those strange things is compelling. But I'd say, we've found records of food being ordered to the base in like the late 80s and some of this, it was like 80.000 a month on this one and there was huge amounts of food being ordered to the base. The base closed down in 1981 and was turned over to the park service in '84. Minnick found receipts for the food in the late 80s. So, 80.000 bucks in a month. Yeah, that seems like it, enough to feed like a town. Cater a couple of weddings. Do you have those records? No, we actually took them out and then, we got chased and kind of threw them up in the air. But I really regret that, throwing them, I really do. I regret it too. Captured from 1993 through 1995, a decade after the base had been shut down. Brian's rare footage shows Camp Hero before its buildings and openings were sealed shut by the park service. The idea of you exploring with your friends, a lot of these things that aren't there anymore, the footage is really unique, it's great stuff. Yeah, thank you, appreciate it. I mean, I've been sitting on this stuff forever, so I'm glad to share it. Yeah, do you have more? Yeah. Alright, here is the colored room. Here, I'll lay these out. And I got the black and white room right here. Okay, interesting. So out of nowhere, after all these years of hearing about acid rooms, Brian just breaks out the pictures and the footage. The LSD rooms, if you look at them, I have good pictures of them. Okay, interesting. This is kinda curious. For what reason... why would a room be painted this way? Check out like the ceiling, not a spot of paint, not a spot on the floor. And then the paisley wallpaper and another which has an odd pattern. This is a great moment in the whole investigation because here was something that really did surprise me. But if you look at the light sockets, they're all, they're not painted over, the trim is not painted over, it's all taped off and it's a professional job. I don't know why the government would do this to any living quarters. It wasn't kids who did this, it's not vandalism It was too well done. Those pictures raise up the ghost of what James Bruce talked about. The acid houses, Timothy Leary, the Montauk Boys, all of that. There's also experiments to mind squash because they had specific types of acid where you could read each other's thoughts and then he would say it back to you and you would say, "Holy, how did you know that?" because you could actually be on the same wavelength. So, you have to ask, what was it for? Why did it happen? And I think the best speculation I've heard, is that, yeah, they were giving people acid. I know the U.S. government has carried out all sorts of unwitting human experimentations involving LSD and other hallucinogens, so I don't find it all that farfetched to suggest that the experiments we know have happened elsewhere, also happened at Camp Hero. As a journalist, those pictures give me an avenue to approach the people who knew Leary, people who worked with him, what would psychedelics researchers say about those images. Are they psychedelic? Is there any record of any experiments being performed with patterns like these involved in the research decades ago, it gives me something to go look at. Fueled by the acid room findings, Minnick increases his frequency to Camp Hero. And State Parks Servicemen begin to take notice. When you were chased, do you have any idea who that was, who was coming? They seemed to be SUVs, white or black SUVs. There's aerial surveillance there too, like there's a helicopter and actually, we got so used to it popping out of nowhere and kind of hovering over us. How many times did the helicopter show up when you were there? Like five, six times at least. The helicopter have any markings? All black, we have a strange video of the helicopter on the point, like harassing boats, I guess is the best way to put it, almost landing on top of the boat. There is another one! The same, exact thing. Footage of base security chasing the teenagers a decade after the base was officially shuttered, begs the obvious question. When taken together, does this footage prove that the government's official position maybe disingenuous? What reason would it have to admit this underground tunnel system from its blueprints? Unless it was hiding something they didn't want anyone to know about. Did you ever get into the proverbial tunnels? Because I keep talking to people over the years and they say they were down there. I've been in several like, underground... Well, there's a basement, there is you know, bunkers that are inside of a hill. Did you ever find anything that would indicate and anything that may have been sealed up that you just couldn't get through or open, that may indicate that there was something else, like another level beneath that. Did you ever find anything like that? Yeah, absolutely. You can feel it, it's like if you touch the walls, there's like there's machinery running somewhere. This is us going into the SAGE radar, so last time we came, this door was completely open. We never had that last time. Now, this is only like a month later and oh, this is important here, this is actually an entrance to the basement. You'd walk along this trench down the steps and there's a door over there that you would go into the basement with. ♪ So, now this is really interesting because again, the official word is, there's nothing underground. Brian shows us this footage and there's clearly something underground. So at the very end of one, there is a heavy door that's been, I guess it's padlocked at the time but it also looks like it has a, like, a wheel to open the door. Like a bank vault? Yeah, like a bank vault almost. So, that was supposedly supposed to go underneath to the basement of that tunnel. It is definitely gonna throw fuel on the fire of people who claim all sorts of crazy stuff went on down there. What I got from Brian's footage is a suggestion of a vast underground tunnel system. What we didn't get to see was, a full mapping of what might be down there. But certainly from his footage, from what I saw, I expect that there is something much more extensive than what Brian and his friends were able to directly access. Either way, it's clear there's more below Camp Hero than the government would have us believe. So what truly is behind these locked doors? Could it be a tunnel system that housed a government mind control program? A deep, dark program that also somehow unlocks the riddle of time travel. an, how could you not at least consider that something happened there with everything from the helicopters chasing the kids to the acid house to clearly there's something being underground. Okay, interesting. Garetano, Eisler and Volk are looking into claims surrounding Camp Hero, a former military installation that some say housed a clandestine government operation of acid testing, mind control, child abduction and time travel. The local's home video footage seems to be the first big break in the investigation. This is important here, this is actually an entrance to the basement. As it appears to reveal an underground tunnel system that flies in the face of the government blueprints which shows nothing is below ground. But how extensive is this underground and what else may be down there? There's only one way to find out, they need to look below the ground. To do so, the men have called in a team of geophysicists to peer below ground and help search for evidence of this covert program called the Montauk Project. You might have heard about the legends of what happened here, structures being buried under the ground here. You walk under the entrance of this thing in the, opening in the wall when it's operating. And you get sucked in, you come out the other end, get dumped on the ground sort of. And uh... 125.000 light years and you're on another planetary system on the opposite side of the galaxy. So we figure something's under the ground, we don't know what. Well we brought several different pieces of geophysical equipment. First was the ground penetrating radar. That's gonna be able to go through and provide to us the highest resolution conditions underground. The other tools that we're bringing, one is a magnetometer and what that's gonna be looking for is any kind of buried, iron bearing object. Then the next method is gonna be electrical resistivity imaging. That is a way that we can provide literally like a slice, a vertical cross section. We're gonna be looking for changes in the electrical properties of the soils or rock. Alright, let's do what you do. Two distinct areas will be put under a geophysical microscope. The first, underneath this bluff to look for some kind of anomaly below ground. The second, less than a mile inland to search for proof of an underground tunnel system not listed in the public records. I am very much looking forward to interacting with the geo guys because they're not invested one way or another in anything having to do with Montauk or even in conspiracies generally as far as I can tell. We use 250 megahertz in that one? Yeah, let's go with the low frequency in that one. They do science, they have instruments that can measure things scientifically, reliably, and determine whether something is underground and with a fairly high degree of reliability what that thing is. He using the low frequency system where we're trying to get that maximum depth of penetration, I'm using the higher frequency one and I'm getting probably around six to eight feet. So in terms of radar, this sight is really- Pretty amendable. - Yeah, pretty amenable. It's gonna help us out. With testing completed along the bluff, the team make their way to site number two, ground zero for the conspiracy. Honestly every one that talks about this legend that knows anything about it, the underground base is supposed to be underneath this entire series of structures of the tower, these buildings here. So if we can get as close as possible to these I think that's where we need to be right now. Can we bring that a little closer? Garetano has obsessed over the claims surrounding Montauk for more than a decade and knows that the geophysicists and their potential underground findings are his best shot at proving the Montauk Conspiracy. It's really important for me personally that we find something factual about this at this point. We've entertained these gentlemen for quite a long time, allowed them to tell their stories. But any possible corroborating evidence of a underground will have to wait. The scientific results will take time. As the men await hard data, they kick into phase two of their investigation. They've been granted rare access and a unique opportunity to record the testimony of the last living legend of the Montauk Project, Preston Nichols. And the most prominent Montauk Boy in the country, the controversial Steward Swerdlow. The Montauk Boys, a collection of individuals who alleged to have been abducted in the 1970s and 80s, taking under the bowels of Camp Hero's supposed tunnel system, and undergone the unspeakable. One such boy is Stewart Swerdlow, the most high profile of them all. Swerdlow and his wife, Janet, have invited filmmaker, Christopher Garetano, former CIA operative, Barry Eisler and hard hitting journalist, Steve Volk into their Michigan home for an on camera interview. If we could start at the beginning, how did you get involved in the Montauk Project. 1970, when the Montauk Project began, I was taken into use there for 13 years until 1983. What was the method that you were first taken into one of these programs, how did they get you? They used derelicts, they used foster children, orphans, the drug addicts and then ultimately, they decided that people with certain genetics, people with certain backgrounds would be more conducive to the more advanced experiments, and that's where I was taken in. With all of these children, their memories were wiped, their genetics were altered and they couldn't always remember what happened, it would be in a form of nightmares or flashbacks. But with me, they could not erase my memory, I became an anomaly for them. So, he was already really special because he's put in this program and even among the special people in the program, he was the most special, he was unique. Underneath is where everything happened. I know from my experience, that there were at least nine levels and maybe there were more, I only knew of nine levels. I did witness children being beaten, murdered, injured in horrible ways. Unfortunately, I was also the subject of some of these horrible things that were administered to the people. So what was the application? Why were they doing this to these kids, like for what reason? It was a continuation of the experiments done by the Nazis in the concentration camps. Swerdlow is drawing a known tangible forensic evidence and first hand survival accounts. Nazis did indeed experiment on humans in concentration camps in Europe, during World War II. What's more, under the leadership of Dr. Josef Mengele, thousands of children were the unfortunate test subjects and incredibly, in what is known as, Operation Paperclip, hundreds of Nazi scientists were brought to the United States during the war. Given new identities and then exploited for their scientific and intelligence value. Some of these Nazi scientists are rumored to have been the creative force behind the Montauk Project. What were they preparing them for? What was the experiment, why would they trigger them? The ultimate goal is for global mind control and programming, to create a mind control system and have a robotical Borg-type population that does whatever you want them to. So is the Montauk Project successful? I can tell you that every single story out there is 100% true, I can tell you that aliens do exist, I can tell you that time travel has been accomplished, that technology has been around since before humans were on the Earth. Humans are not the original inhabitants of this planet. Stewart is making extraordinary claims. You have interviewed a number of people who have had extraordinary claims, people who've seen UFOs for example. I understand a certain baseline level of nervousness, you're about to say something that you know people are going to think you're crazy and of course, that'll make you nervous and reticent. Does Stewart seem like that to you? Does he seem different? He seems different, he's too sure of himself, comparing him to the other people I've interviewed. They sort of struggle to process this, integrate it, understand it, he claims to have this complete overarching view of how everything works, from the illuminati to aliens from other star systems. Show time. Good job. - Thanks. Fun times, you got a lot on the table. What questions would you have for Stewart, I really think it's important that you k every single one of them. Steve's got a whole laundry list. Okay. - Yeah. Stewart, Steve Volk, good to meet you, been really looking forward to this. Um... I wrote a book several years ago, called Fringe-ology: How I Tried To Explain Away the Un-Explainable- And Couldn't and so I come at this from a perspective of being really open to paranormal claims and thinking they should be taken seriously. So, one of the interesting things to me about this is that, normally the program involving kids, nobody would miss. You were different so, whenever you were working in the Montauk Project, your parents knew where you were? I can't say that they did. I can only tell you that there were times when they said they came into my room and I wasn't there. And so, if they came into your room and you weren't there, that must have thrown them into a, you know, and they didn't expect you to be gone. It must have thrown them into a panic. Very interesting question because I feel that there was some kind of dampening field or control system put on the people who were in the house at the time, so that they didn't question whatever they observed, it just wasn't a matter of normal occurrence to them. They just noticed you were gone and not think anymore about it. Not pay any attention to it. Stewart Swerdlow and the dampening field, there's some pretty way out stuff that the CIA wiz kids can do, but I've never heard about anything like a dampening field. Your website reads that you're a gifted hyperspace intuitive, able to move your consciousness beyond time and space, to determine a person's foundational mind pattern upon which all our life experiences are based, right? Look at the blinking. That is a classic sign of nervousness, blinking, rapid blinking. Steve starts reading stuff from his website and the feeling is, "God, this guy's checked me out. "I'm on the record saying this stuff, "what kind of questions am I gonna get, they're gonna be hard questions." And he starts blinking. First, can you define what it means to be a hyperspace intuitive? It means that you can move outside of physical reality and see the energies associated with the existence of a person, place and thing. Okay, so I think the big opportunity for me here is if, you know, these things are real and there are people capable of doing this stuff, to see them do it and have that validation. You want me to do a reading for you? However brief, however long, if you could just give me something, it would be terrific. Well, I could tell you about some of your health issues. Go for it. To look at you right now, straight on, I can tell you that you have an issue with the hormonal system, testosterone level is a bit low. You've also issue with your blood cells, are a very low count in red blood cells. Now you're also able to tell people when they're programmed. Mhmm. Everyone's programmed. Everyone's programmed? Everyone on this planet. So, I'm programmed? Of course, you are. We're all programmed? How would we get out of it? What's the de-programming technique. You want me to repeat volumes of books, to tell you how to de-program. It involves a lot of things. It's interesting, because you have such a wide base of knowledge in terms of, how people are programmed, how to remove that programming. The relationship of various alien races to all this and yet, we can't get evidence, for instance of Montauk and the project itself. The reason you can't get physical proof, is because if the government admits this, they have to take responsibility on all the people they've damaged and hurt. So they're not going to admit any of this ever. It just... In past government conspiracies, it just seems like some sort of denial, some sort of effort would come to stop you now, when you're at a level before everybody believes you. They've put me in prison, they've threatened me, they harass me on a weekly basis. Yes, I'm harassed all the time. Let's talk about the prison thing then, when did they put you in prison. They put me in prison in 19... 92 to 93 maybe. For? One count of bank fraud. You plead guilty in the case right? I was forced to because they threatened my family. There is a long running non-profit, called, the Cult Education Institute run by Rick Ross and they have a public forum where people have concerns about groups, can post there possibly- I'm going to interrupt, I'm sorry... Here we go. - But that... I don't think I like the line of questioning. I don't either and that man, I'll tell you, I know exactly who it is, who has written those things and they lie and they have had problems with us and they have attacked us and, I don't want him addressing it. I even myself, have wrote to Rick Ross, to say, "Please take this down." I think he is a fraud. I don't want to go there. This was supposed to be about Montauk, not to interrogate and try and make this into something it's not. What is your agenda? What is your agenda because your line of questioning is quite disturbing. ine of questioning is quite disturbing. My agenda is to ask the questions that I think any reporter would ask. Steve Volk's interview with a self-professed central player in the Montauk Project, Stewart Swerdlow, devolves into chaos. I am so angry. Christopher, I want you out of my house. So, that was different. I've never been kicked out of anybody's house before. In a 20-year career I've never been kicked out of anybody's office, I've never been kicked out of an interview. Why do you think it was different today? I'm convinced that he was never approached this way before by a standard issue journalist doing standard journalism, pulling documents, asking these questions, and he did not know how to handle it. Okay, so my question for you two is is the Montauk Project not true because of that? See, that's a great question. Just because we may have uncovered someone who was glomming onto the Montauk allegations and finding a way to grift off that. That doesn't mean that the underlying allegations aren't true, this is just an opportunist who's taking advantage, possibly, right? The fact that one person's taking advantage isn't proof that the thing itself didn't happen. So that's part of the challenge of what we're doing here. It's gonna be hard to find definitive proof, positive proof of the underlying claims. The underlying claims of the Montauk Project. Abduction of children for human experimentation, a vast mind control program, LSD testing, and the successful application of a time-travel device. The allegations lead directly to one Preston Nichols. Author of theMontauk Project, Nichols is the lead protagonist of the legend and the most active spokesperson of this enduring mystery. The men have secured a meeting with him. Yet before they make their way to his compound in Upstate New York, they stop by an old friend and follower whom they hope can lay the groundwork for their most important interview to date. We're on our way to see a woman named Doreen Buckman. She was at the early meetings with Preston Nichols and Al Bielek at the psychotronic meetings. This happened in the mid 80s. Hi Doreen. How are you? - Nice to meet you, I'm Christopher. We're here today to really talk to you about your experiences and the early psychotronic group with Preston Nichols. Preston was a brilliant man. You know, his posse of guys would think he was an avatar. He was a genius, he was very concise when he talked and he could take these very very complex scientific topics and really bring them down. I'm gonna show you the two receivers as featured in the Montauk Book In the 1970s and 80s, Nichols was at the forefront of a mind control movement called psychotronics, a branch of parapsychology that claims that government agents use electromagnetic radiation to transmit thoughts and sounds into people's heads. His followers, such as Doreen, claim he could do incredible things. Preston was talking about the government controlling the weather, and it sounded so off the hook to me. I'm like, rolling my eyes thinking really, controlling the weather? He had this electronic box with dials on it and in less than three seconds he changed the weather in that room. And if I wasn't there, I woulda never believed it. All of a sudden it was freezing like you were in the Arctic. It was less than three seconds, I was like okay, maybe they can control the weather. So that really happened, you felt the change? If I wasn't there, I would not believe it. I really don't think there's anything I can say to prepare you for what you're about to see. The Outer Limits. Yup, The Outer Limits. He's got solar panels, it looks like a junkyard. I've been to some really interesting places in my time with the CIA, top secret places, and I've also traveled extensively throughout the world. I have never seen anything like what I saw at Preston's compound. Just a regular pot on my head. In order to prevent microwaving from the satellite system over the planet, you need a solid metal, not just a loose metal, but it has to be solid. So Preston, tell me about where we are right now. What is this place? This is my metaphysical lab here. The mind-amplifying sound system, and all this stuff here forms a big radionics machine. And what does a radionics machine do? It uses the quantum energies of the sound system to store into the vacuum tubes and I can put my thoughts through the sound system into the vacuum tubes and reach out on a quantum level and do things, so to speak. Quantum electronics. Is that a thing, have you ever heard of it? So at what point were you recruited for the Montauk Project? Do you have a memory of that? 1968. '68? But I'm not too sure. See, I have recollections of going somewhere through the teleporter and ending up in an area disassembling this huge UFO. And I thought it was out at Montauk. This board right here, this is the Delta-T antenna terminal interface. You can patch the REO in the RF from here. You worked on the SAGE radar tower? Yeah, I did. They sent you out there to do some work... Yeah, to do some work. And at that time, did you notice anything out of the ordinary? You know, what they did is they generated another parallel timeline that I worked on. Once I pulled back the memory of that parallel timeline, bang, it all comes in. It all comes in as a confused mess. When did you start to realize that this was a mind control project? I know that they were recruiting kinda runaways and unwanteds. They were taking people and they were literally shattering their minds. Cairo New York, home to the picturesque Blackhead Mountains and to Preston Nichols, author of the Montauk Project, a book that claims a deep government conspiracy involving mind control, time travel and the abduction of teenage boys. They were taking people and they were literally shattering their minds. They have this army of probably a million people, that are in reserve, in the public, in reserve ready to be activated and called on. Former CIA, Eisler and journalist, Volk are engaged, yet frustrated. They want to see hard evidence of these claims. There isn't much time left. Is there anything you can demonstrate as a form of proof for all the people who are going to doubt your story. As Volk replaces the filmmaker, Garetano in the interview chair, the no-nonsense investigative reporter jumps right in. Where did you get your engineering degree from? Where'd you actually get the degree? University of Tampa. Okay. University of Tampa Bay, something I can check. So, tell me about the super soldiers, are you aware of any success stories at all with the super soldier part of the program? I heard about it when I deprogrammed quite a few other guys on Long Island. I heard of these guys going aboard a ship, going another planet, fighting battles. How do you feel about him? If there's any truth to any of this and the government wanted to discredit it, you could not design something better than that. There's a guy outside, wearing a cook pot on his head and our conversation was completely normal but he's wearing a cook pot on his head. So, the Montauk Project, the story as a whole, is so fantastic and what would be incredible is to get some kind of evidence or proof right? So, is there any of that technology that you can demonstrate at this point. Are you capable at this point of building a time machine? Not yet. Not yet, but there was one built for the Montauk Project? Yeah. You say you have a degree in electrical engineering right? With your background and having helped create and design the system, it would seem that you would have been capable of drawing up the complete schematic right? You wouldn't have to worry about money again, all these years that you had to do this. No, you know what I'd have to be worried about? Being six foot under. The government does not want the public having any access to a time device whatsoever. As long as the Montauk Project stays a legend, as I say in the book, you can believe it is fact or you can believe it as a science fiction. One thing that is really clear to me, leaving Preston Nichols' place is, if you consider the man that Doreen described, a kind of avatar, almost a guru figure that people gravitated toward and if you look at the guy that got captured by Chris on film, you can see, decay happening. I'm sure that we did not meet quite the same Preston Nichols that other people had met years earlier. Yet what does Preston's deterioration mean for the Montauk Project at large. Does it make the tale less valid? For the former spook, Eisler, the answer is obvious. Preston seems to really believe this stuff that he's saying. I will say this, you don't have to believe in the supernatural or in science fiction to believe that, in fact to know, that humans do sometimes conduct experiments on other humans. The CIA does not deny that the experiments took place. What most excites me about this project, is the opportunity to put the allegations in historical perspective, by examining the actual history of human experimentation in America. Well, Holmesburg is one of those actual instances of human experimentation. Holmesburg Prison in Philadelphia, like MKUltra and other sanctioned government programs, one's a hot bed for human experimentation, government overreach and access. And the reason that you are here, is because of the infamous medical experiments that took place here for a quarter century. Now, the next stop for the team investigating Montauk, to look for parallels and lengths back to Camp Hero. This facility became the K-Mart of human experimentation in Cold War America. estigation into the Montauk Project. While aspects of the tale at Camp Hero sounero d extreme and sinister, many of its claims mirror a pattern of behavior proven true at other government facilities. So many Americans don't know about these darker chapters of the country's history. These experiments have actually been done on prisoners, orphans, disabled children. The question we're trying to answer is, did these things happen at Montauk? To help answer it, the men have arrived in the City of Brotherly Love, the stomping ground of investigative reporter Steve Volk. Alright, fellas, today we are going to move beyond the realm of conspiracy theory and into conspiracy fact and history. I wanted to take Chris and Barry to Philadelphia, my hometown, to show them a conspiracy that's still outrageous, but it's grounded, because we know it happened. And here are the people that went through it. Holmesburg today is permanently shut down, but this massive complex built in the late 19th century was once home to Al Capone, and is infamous for hosting a clandestine bioethics research project gone wrong, where inmates were used as human lab rats. This is imposing, look at this. Iron riveted doors about 15 feet high. Gentlemen! Hello there. Allen Hornblum. Welcome to Northeast Philly and Holmesburg Prison. Allen Hornblum, author and lecturer, ran an adult literacy program at the prison starting in 1971. Over time, he witnesses events that inform his seminal work of non-fiction, and a classic in the field of bioethics, Acres of Skin. We've got a scholar Allen Hornblum, who's written an entire footnoted book including interviews with many of the participants and the victims of these studies. This facility was built in 1895, the end of the Victorian Era. And the reason that you are here is because of the infamous medical experiments that took place here for a quarter century. This facility became the K-Mart of human experimentation in Cold War America. Regrettably, very few Americans know that some very, very nasty unsavory things took place in the name of science in America, not just Nazi Germany. The worst case is that they were applying dioxin to the faces and backs of prisoners here. This is an ingredient in Agent Orange, is that right? It's the most carcinogenic and dangerous part of the Agent Orange. Although the doctor behind these experiments, Albert Kligman, destroyed most of the records when the program was exposed in 1974, we know the Holmesburg Prison experiment to be fact. Kligman has proudly admitted to such experimentation. His former employers and the U.S. Army don't deny that the tests were conducted for their research purposes. And most telling of all, a number of patients left the prison to tell their first person stories to Hornblum. This was a room converted to a laboratory area where the doctors kept a lot of their materials and chicals and things like that. What other experiments were conducted here besides just the dermatological experiments? We read about LSD? The Army comes in here in 1963. They're looking for basically the Manchurian Candidate. They're trying to come up with a chemical that they can give an inmate, and then they can direct him to do certain things, if they wish. So, this was real? Uh, this was real, it happened here. We talk about the Montauk Project, and when people hear the term Manchurian Candidate... You know, some people laugh at the idea. But now we're sitting in front of Allen Hornblum and he says and confirms that gentlemen were being used at Holmesburg Prison to be turned into Manchurian Candidates. So Allen, the bottom line is that they were conducting mind control experiments here for sure. Without a doubt, the U.S. Army Chemical Corps was performing mind control experiments in here from 1963 to approximately 1971, 72. The men are in for more. Two survivors from Holmesburg have agreed to sit for interviews, Edward Yusef Anthony, and Leodus Jones. An impassioned Eisler decides to lead the charge. When you locked up at night, a guy comes down the block pushing a hand truck, with cups of medication on it. They would have you to sign, a consent form. Did you ever have an opportunity to consult with a lawyer before signing that form? No. They coerce you to believe that the tests are safe. They told you they were safe. Yeah, they tell you that in, in orientation. It's nothing to worry about. They took my forearm, and they used some scotch tape. And what they would do is, put the tape in this area, and just stick it, pull it, stick it, pull it, stick it, pull it and stick it, and pull it until they pull off the top layer of skin. And then they would use the dropper to put some kind of liquid solution in that area. They didn't tell you what that liquid solution was. Uh, no, they didn't. It was cold. And next thing you know, I could taste it all in my mouth, coming from my bloodstream, you know. And I gets to my cell. And I stepped in the cell, I just fell out, boom! On the floor, and my cell partners helped me up on the bed. And my back felt like it was on fire. So I said, "Man, take these things off my back, man." So, he stripped them off and put them on the wall. Whatever chemical was in that thing ate the paint off the wall. Oh my god! Ate the paint off the wall. What took place in here, during that period, was inhumane, unjust, unconstitutional, and disgraceful. The personal accounts Leodus and Yusef share from their time at Holmesburg have a visceral impact on the men. Can you imagine what that would have been like? Like you're standing there, witnessing it. How do you rationalize something like that? How do you look in the mirror and say, "I'm one of the good guys, I'm a good person. "And that's why I injected a child with radioactive compounds "today, just to see what will happen, without his consent or any sort of informed consent at all." How do you rationalize something like that? I hope more people are gonna know about this. All the elements are tantamount to the Montauk Project. The human experimentation stuff is almost identical and so we have to take that into consideration. We're looking at something that perhaps once was a thing where the victims of Holmesburg tried to tell people and they were thought to be crazy. Maybe the Montauk Project will be confirmed and at some point people will be visiting and talking to victims and they'll take it seriously, much like we do the Holmesburg Prison experiments. For that to happen, hard proof of Montauk, like which exists at Holmesburg, needs to be confirmed and uncovered. Might it come through the supposed acid rooms? Or will that final piece of definitive proof reveal itself from below ground? To find out, the men make their way back to Long Island. The scientific results from the geophysicists are finally ready. We found something really interesting. here they started, there are two aspects of this investigation that remain outstanding and could prove the Montauk Project true. Here is the colored room. First, these pictures and video that appear to show rooms at the former military base used for LSD testing and human experimentation. It wasn't kids who did this, it's not vandalism. It was just, it was too well done. And second, the results of geophysical testing, undertaken by a team of scientists to try and show some kind of proof of an underground not shown in the government blueprints. Hi, Steve! Hey! Thanks so much, I really appreciate you making some time for this. While waiting for those results, the investigator Volk spends weeks digging into the allegations about the LSD rooms and potential ties to acid guru Timothy Leary among other things learned along the way. He presents his findings in Garetano's studio. Preston's interesting to me, because I looked to see if he graduated from the University of Tampa. He did not graduate, where there's no record of him graduating from the University of Tampa. But, you know, I did take his book and show the diagrams to a couple of electrical engineers who said these are not electrical engineering diagrams. But in terms of where that leaves us, he's kind of a dead circuit to us now in terms of proving or disproving the Montauk Project because of the condition he's in. So, I went ahead and called a number of psychedelics researchers, some modern ones, David Nutt, Robin Carhart-Harris, Ralph Metzner, who is 80 years old, who worked directly with Leary. Metzner said that he didn't see anything particularly psychedelic about the patterns, but Nutt and Carhart-Harris said they did. Hey! There you are. I talked to his son Zachary, who's begun working with the archive, his archivist Michael Horowitz, Thomas Lannen, who presides over the archive and runs it at the New York Public Library. They all said that, look, the idea that he would knowingly participate, and that word's key, right, the idea that he would knowingly participate in an experiment with the military or the government, who would clearly be thinking to weaponize the very drug that he thought should be a tool of liberation is just a total non-starter for them. As far back as I can remember, you know, he stood by his claims that psychedelics were very very powerful tools that could empower the individual to think for themselves. In sum, it appears unlikely that Timothy Leary was in Montauk, or had any role at Camp Hero. Yet that doesn't mean acid testing or other human experimentation didn't occur there. The men make their way to the century-old Montauk Manor, to meet up with the ground penetrating radar team. The results of their underground tests are in. We started out in the bluff area. That was an area where we were specifically concerned about any large buried metallic object. With the magnetometer survey we really didn't find much. But the radar was a lot more interesting. On that bluff area, there was an area of a depressed area of soils. When we ran the radar over that, we got a really significant change in the response. A lot of disruption to the signal. So what that typically means is that you've had some type of excavation activity that has occurred at the property. Now, we don't know if the excavation activity would have been due to somebody digging and burying something, or somebody digging, excavating, taking something out, back filling the soils. We've heard everything from stories of barrels being interred to, you know, kids being murdered in the experiments and perhaps buried out there as well. So, I'm just curious, something was buried there and then removed or the soil was disturbed in other ways. Definitely the soil was disturbed, without a doubt. We know something happened there, somebody dug and filled it in. But why? What purpose? That we don't know. The location that I was actually expecting a result from, and that we're all waiting for the result right now, what exactly did you find there? We did electrical resistivity imaging. And we found something really interesting there also. What was it? We were able to go through an image, down to a depth of just about 60 feet, so I was really happy with the data results there. So, we went through and modeled it up. We're starting at the entrance gate at the radar facility, and then heading to that main road that's to the north. What these colors represent are the resistances of soils. And so you can see most of the area we're looking in is in these yellows and blues. The two areas of interest were in this very bright red area and then this dark blue area. How large of an area is this? The red area is in the range of, I would say between 20 and 30 feet in diameter. In terms of depth, the top of the feature was probably right around 20 feet. So we're looking at a very significant structure. Yeah, it's pretty deep. That means you have soils in there or earth materials that have a lot of metal in them. And so the possible scenario would be, some kind of buried concrete, reinforced structure. Could it be part of a tunnel? Or are you seeing enough here to tell you that there is not space on either side? Since we're looking at just basically a vertical slice, we really can't tell what's going on to either side of it. So guys, based on these anomalies you've found here, what's your best guess as to what you're seeing with this data? I can't think of any kind of a natural geological mechanism that would be responsible for that type of thing, so the indication would be possibly we've got some kind of buried man made structure in that area. See, there's not supposed to be anything there, so the fact that you've found that is amazing. GeoView's findings out by the radar tower are more interesting because the anomaly is larger, it's deeper under ground, it seems to include metal of some kind, it has the right conductivity for that. The blueprints we've seen don't show any structures under ground. So here is an anomaly. The question is what is it? Is it an underground tunnel system? Or is it just, I don't know, a fuel tank or a storage room? Proof, certainly, that something large exists in the bowels of Camp Hero that's not in the official government record. Yet is it definitive evidence of the extraordinary claims that make up the Montauk Project? For Garetano, it's proof enough as to why he's been obsessed for over a decade. After all these years, we've found evidence. We've found something beneath Camp Hero. What we're witnessing is the progression towards really proving this to be true. Especially with the stuff we found at the end of our journey. I think in the next five years or so we're gonna find out that this thing happened. I really do and I think we're an integral part to that. For Eisler and Volk, exploring this strange, mysterious site has been a stepping stone to a larger goal. The fact is the government has done lots of wonderful things. America is the greatest nation in the history of the earth, but it's perpetrated a lot of evil too. What happens is there's this huge wall of secrecy and then what leaks, what gets past that wall are some pretty atrocious and horrifying programs. Project Stargate... MKUltra... Area 51... Dugway Proving Ground... Operation Seaspray... a fraction of the theories and projects that have all been linked, like Montauk, to deep, dark government conspiracies in American history... and all worthy of investigation... onThe Dark Files.
