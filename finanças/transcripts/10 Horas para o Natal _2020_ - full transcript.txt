This is the craziest Christmas story you've ever heard. But to tell you about our Christmas this year, first I'll have to explain how our Christmas dinner used to be. We are the Silva family, and this was our last Christmas together. This is my father, Marcos Henrique. He is very funny, but also a freeloader. Sonia, since you're standing there, please, give me the remote control. You're kidding me, Marcos Henrique. I'm baking the turkey, making French toasts, toasted manioc flour with and without raisins, and you're just sitting there. Ouch! It won't hurt you. You're so rude. My mother Sonia has always been a goody two-shoes. She worried about every detail of our dinner. Ouch! Open the door! My baby... The door, Marcos Henrique. For God's sake! What have you done? What's that on the floor? Clean it up. Insensitive! Can't you see it left a stain on my baby? There's no solution for it. The stain will make it look better. Open the door! Look, they're actually here. - Come in, aunt Zilu. - I thought there was nobody home. I wish there wasn't. Merry Christmas! Aunt Zilu and aunt Aldinha always came over to keep grandma Nena company. Uncle Silvio is here. As well as cousin Silvio, the funniest person I know. I only have pies for you. But no. How are you, sweetie? - Hello, uncle Silvio. - My beautiful. - Dad? - Yes, honey. - Dad? - Yes. Can we open our presents? Only after midnight. Here we do it before! Or the children will go crazy! Merry Christmas! A science game. I love Christmas! Don't move! Every year I fall for it. Despite all differences, Mom and Dad had a lot of fun together. Happy Birthday... I'm joking. Ah! When the Silva family gets together... It's fun and joy all over. No one can beat us. You got the biggest piece, Sonia. Well, was in the kitchen all day. This is a little dry. Next year you do it. You can have the thigh. Then one day Dad no longer thought Mom was fun and Mom no longer thought Dad was fun. And they separated. There was no joy all over anymore. Ah! Jingle bells! Are we too early, cousin? No, I'm just getting a clean shave. After all, it's Christmas. Even Santa Claus came to Christmas dinner, but Dad. - Bia! - Come in! Mom! Sonia and the children are here. Let me finish shaving. Sure. With the separation, there was the brilliant idea of deciding who would be with us during Holiday Season. Mom had us at Christmas and Dad at New Year's. And our Christmas turned into this lame thing you're about to see. Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho, ho! Silvio. Did you bring the pie? It's over there. You only have pies for me. Got it? What's up, Mom? I'm coming, Son. Mom decided to keep aunt Zilu and aunt Aldinha company. And also cousin Silvio. Hilarious. It's great, Mom. Just how I like it. I'll give you your present. - It looks beautiful. - First let me... I have something to do here. This is wonderful! Mom was crazy about the turkey thigh. She had to have one every Christmas. She knows I love the thigh. - Give me your plate. - Thanks, Mom. Now you guys can go ahead. Help yourself. Worse than our Christmas, only Dad's. Mom, I'm sick of seeing you with this yarn. It's becoming an obsession. And I'm sick of this ugly chair. And I don't complain. It must be the pizza. - What flavor did you order? - Turkey, of course. How depressing. My goodness! That wasn't right. Not that I cared so much about Christmas. Miguel and I no longer believed in Santa Claus. But Bia still believed in the good old man. She loved Christmas. Mom, that's not what I asked Santa. That's why we decided to do something about it. The Silva's joy had to come back, no matter what. TÍTULO Julia? Miguel? Bia? I don't want to go. Neither do I. I'm big enough to stay home alone. We're all going to do the groceries together. Did you forget I have to make potato salad? I changed my shift to spend Christmas with my family. I don't want to fight today. Is Dad spending Christmas with us? No, Bia. You'll be with him on New Year's Eve. So we're not spending Christmas with our family. - Hello, aunt. - Hello, Sonia. How are you? I just want to remind you to bring potato salad. Of course, aunt. I'm not going to forget. You're a little absent-minded. Alright. Come, guys. Don't worry, aunt. Christmas started a little weird. It was so cold, as if it was going to snow. And to make things worse, Mom had made plans to eat dinner at Aunt Zulu's again. Julia, can I borrow your cell phone? - No. - Miguel, the seat belt. Wait, Mom! - Give it to me. - I'm going to hit you. Stop, guys. He's provoking me. She's being selfish. I'm going to get ro-ro-roller skates. Bia took my glasses. I can't believe it! I have to put a sign on my door, "Do not enter." She can't read anyway. Yes, I can. "Yes, I can." B and A: ba. B and E: be. And B and I, annoying Bia. - Stop picking on her, Miguel. - M and A: ma. M and E: me. M and I: dumb Miguel! - Stop it! - Bonehead Miguel! Hello, Cris! Merry Christmas! Hi, Sonia. My water broke. And I'm having contractions. - Are you sure? - Absolutely. Let's do this. Meet me at the hospital. What a date my children picked to be born. It's Christmas. Very symbolic. And twins. I don't know if I can handle it. Of course you can. I have three here. It's a piece of cake. Hopefully the ascendants help. As long as it's not Virgo, Scorpio or Taurus. You're an obstetrician and an astrologer? Christmas special: a child and a birth chart. In your case it's two: two children and two birth charts. See you soon. Breathe. Kisses. Kisses. Guys, change of plan. If you're going to the hospital, where are we going? - Ah, Mom! - What? - What did you lose now? - My wallet. I can't find it anywhere. Help me find it, Mom. I'm tired of helping you look for your things. Ask Saint Anthony. I'm going to do the groceries. Saint Anthony! Mom, what about the potato salad we were going to buy? If you don't bring it, aunt Zilu will kill you. I know darn well what will happen to me if I don't bring the potato salad. I have an idea. We don't have to go to aunt Zilu's house. Then she'll make my body disappear. Mom, am I getting a dog this year? Of course not, Miguel. I can't believe this. You cannot even take a shower alone. Stinky Miguel! It's you. Stinky Miguel! Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system. Where are you when I need you? Here. Saint, Anthony, I'm late now but I'll jump soon. Mom, I don't want to go to aunt Zilu's again. I'm sorry. You have to. The twins decided to be born today. I'm picking you up at 8. Take a shower there. I don't want any stinky feet tonight. Stinky feet. Mom, it's dad! Hey! Do you want to kill me? Yes, you don't answer your stupid phone. Get out, guys. On the sidewalk. Hurry up! Where? - To your house. - Mine? My patient is having twins. I'm going to the hospital. What human being decides to have twins at Christmas? Can't she wait until tomorrow? Is she going to call them Joseph and Mary? Shut up. I'm serious. So am I. It's the last sales day at the store. It's crazy there. I'll pick them up in the evening; at 8 pm and then I'll take them to aunt Zilu's. Aunt Zilu's? Argh! Argh! See what you're doing? You're spoiling them. Am I lying? She's really annoying. No one can stand her or that uncle Silvio. How is it? "Mom, I'm hungry. Mom, I've pooed." Get off my back. I'm asking you for help. Can't you be serious at least once? - Stop acting like a child. - Alright. They'll stay with my mom. She'll be right back. Yay! I'll pick you up at 8. I love you. Behave! - Such an angel. - Yes, I am. What a being of light! She brightened up our day. You're welcome. Thank you, Sonia. - Where's Miguel? - Over there. Where's Miguel? Miguel! Come back here! Darn! I told you not to play with street dogs. You don't know if they've been vaccinated. I have to go. I'm late. Julia, here are the keys. Go up now. Your grandmother will be right there. - Dad? - Yes. Why do you hate aunt Zulu? Hate is not the right word; it's too strong. I don't hate her, we have conflicting personalities. What are conflicting personalities? It's when... It's when two people think completely different, and nothing can change that. Is this why you and mom separated? More or less, Son. We'll talk about it later. Please, go upstairs. Dad is late. See you soon. Wait a minute. Julia. Here's some money for ice cream. - If you need anything. - Thanks, Dad. I love you. - Kisses. - Kisses. I'll see you later. Bye. Damn! Come in. Does anybody know how to do this? - No, I don't. Excuse me. - Hey! I don't care. I was here first. Get out, Miguel. Move your feet. You're hurting me. Stupid. I was here first. Who cares? What is it, Bia? Mom... and Dad forgot to give my letter to Santa Claus. I'm not getting my ro-ro-roller skates. I don't want panties for Christmas again. Who in the world doesn't know you want roller skates? Santa doesn't. I don't know what Christmas is for. For nothing. I hate having siblings. So do I. Stop crying, Bia. Come here, Julia. I had a great idea. Since mom and dad can't plan a Christmas for us, we'll do it ourselves. We'll buy and prepare everything, and when Mom comes to get us, voilà! Dinner is ready. Voilà, what, artificial intelligence? We don't have a tree, turkey or gifts. We can buy it. We have 50 bucks. And we can deliver Bia's letter to Santa. Alright. Sure! As if this money was enough. She'll keep crying and it's all your fault. She cries every day and it's never my fault. So annoying! Alright! Anything to make this child stop crying. Yes! We have until 8 PM. We have 10 hours until Christmas. May Santa bless us. Let's go, guys. What? Let's go. Grandma is coming. Let's go. It will work out. Come, Bia. Will it really work out? Come. Give me your hand. Come, Miguel. - Are you going out? - We're saving Christmas. That's a great deed. Good luck. Thank you! Bye! What mall are we going to? The Christmas shopping mall. "The Christmas shopping mall." Don't be stupid, Bia. There's no such thing. We're not going to a mall. We're going to that street where the shops are cheaper. What's the name again? I know it's a date. I just can't remember which. Good morning, Valeria. How are you? What's up? Good morning. Has anybody called? What's the date again? I don't know. May 20th. No. - October 10th. - No. - April 1st. - Stop saying random dates. Alright. Mark, 400. No. Mark is a name, not a month. It's just like June. June is a name and a month. So it must be 9th of June. Guys, I need to concentrate and you just... Stop it. You're so rude. Bia! Are you out of your mind? Come here! - It's March 25th. - Right! I told you it was Mark. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Here. I don't have any change. But that's all we got. So get off and change it. 50 bucks to pay the fare. This is a bus, not a bank, kid. I'll pay for their fare, for God's sake. This girl will make everyone here deaf. - Thank you. - Thank you. Excuse me. Bia is coming through. Oh, no! Not this song again. As if it snowed in Brazil. But for the first time it's cold I remember being all sweaty before at Christmas. We had human heat. I still don't like this song. FLYING SKATES Look! Look! My ro-ro-roller skates! My ro-ro-roller skates! Julia, do you think Santa will bring it to me in time? Of course, he will. Of course, he will, Bia. Santa takes orders until 6 o'clock. Until 6 pm. Don't worry. Don't worry. It will be alright. HOSPITAL - MATERNITY Me too. Please stop. You're so little. - Are you by ourselves? - No. - Yes. - Maybe. Hold on. - Who's with you? - My mother. - My dad. - Both. Both. You're running away from home. No. Yes, you're running away from home. Fun is over. Driver, please stop at the Juvenile Court. There are 3 children here running away from home. They keep screaming in my ear. Leave those children alone before the little one starts screaming again. They have to go to Juvenile Court. They're minors. No, they're children. You are lazy. Driver, before going to Juvenile Court, let me get off on the next stop. Excuse me. - Crazy! - Just go. - Run, Bia. - Come, guys. I won't let the little one run. Let my sister go. Let her go. Come! Come, guys. Run. That was close. Cris, you're 3 cm dilated. Soon you'll go into labor and see your babies' faces. Please, hang in there. Let's sit down. Help her up. Sure. Come, Cris. Right there. Sit. - How many children do you have? - I have 3, one more than you. Were they natural birth? The girls yes, but Miguel is stubborn, Taurean, you know; it was C-section. Bring the children into the world, Lord! Wow! It looks like one of those end-of-the-world movies. Listen, Santa, if you do exist, help me with a miracle this Christmas. Keep holding my hand no matter what. Got it? Excuse me. Guys! Bia! Miguel! Bia! Miguel! Bia! Miguel! Bia! Miguel! Bia! Bia! I was so afraid of losing you! I'm so glad. Now let's find Miguel. Bia! Julia! Get down, kid. Bia! Julia! I'm here! Over there. Julia! Bia! Ah, Miguel! I was so afraid of losing you! Did you miss me, sis? Let's focus or we'll run out of time. Alright. Hey, Julia, what about Santa? I have to give him my letter. Hey, Bia, we'll find him on the way. Let's go. Hello. Can you help me? Sure. This one here? It looks just like you. There are 1,8 million stores here. Which one are we going to? That one. "The Christmas shopping mall." Who can't read here? Now you're speechless, dummy. Don't call me dummy. But you're dummy. Wow! It looks like I'm inside my snow globe. It's true. Let's focus or we'll run out of time. Yes. 850 reais for a tree? No, there must be a cheaper one. - There must be a cheaper one. - For sure. Not even half. Cool. The smallest tree costs 60 reais. And if we put a star on top, it will fall back. Look! - He must be the owner. - Yes. Let's bargain. Let's go. Hello! - Hello! - Hello! How are you? How does this work? Does the cheapest tree really cost 60 reais? The price is in the tag. Can't you make a discount for us? The price is in the tag. I know, sir. But we only have 50 bucks for our entire Christmas. It's not enough. Please, sir. Can't you help us? Please. Where is your Christmas spirit? How could I fall for your great idea, dummy? I'm not dummy. Airhead dummy. 50 bucks would never be enough. We'd better stop this and go back home before Dad finds out. It's over. It's over. It's over. - Julia, we can... - Give up, Miguel. - Julia! - It will never work out. Julia! Julia! Thanks, honey. - How did you do this? - Crying? I have other methods, honey. In this last 30 minutes we hugged each other more than in the entire year. I was beginning to get the feeling that the plan could actually work. Now it's time for the gifts. Come on, guys! Let's go. Hello, Marcos Henrique? Look what I found for Dad. Mom is always saying that he has his head in the clouds. Ouch! Guys! For mom! Isn't she the love of our lives? Yeah. I like it. How are you? We'd like to take this. We don't have all this money. You were right, Julia. It was a stupid idea. No, it wasn't. Wait! Insensitive. Bye, honey. It was good while it lasted. I'll always remember our moments together. - Are you sure, Julia? - Yes. - Your iClone? - I'm sure. - Be careful with the cars. - Alright. - You were amazing, sis. - Yes, you were. I was beginning to like those hugs. My sadness was even going away. Let's go, guys. Now we have lots of money. I can't stand those children anymore. I can't stand being disrespected, being underestimated, being treated like a dog. I've had enough. I lived my whole life for them. Enough! Hello. Hello, Mom. Hello? Hello, Mom. Who is it? It's me, your son. Marcos Henrique. Why didn't you say so? Alright. How's everything? Are the children calm? Yes, the children. Children are the soul of the house. It's okay. Mom, I'll be there soon. Take care, take care of the children. I'll be home soon. Love you. Poor thing. He misses the children. Poor thing. Christmas sale? - Yes. - Let's go! Hello! Juju? Hello! - Hello. - Ah! I can't believe it! I can't believe it! I can't believe it! I can't believe it! I can't believe it! I can't believe it! Park for me. Bia! Miguel! Julia! Julia! Bia! Miguel! Julia! We rocked it! - Let's find Santa Claus, Bia? - Yes! But first can we get something to eat? I'm starving. I'm hungry too. Let's go, then. Bia! Miguel! Julia! Where are my children? Give my daughter's cell phone back! What? Darn! Where's my daughter? The owner of this cell phone. Daughter sold it to me. Good deal for both. How can you make a deal with a child? This is way too dishonest. Children are smarter than both of us together. That's true. They can trick anyone. Translate it with anger. Put energy in your voice. I want to know where my children are. "Stleet." - "Stleet." - "Stleet." - "Stleet." - "Stleet." - "Stleet." - "Stleet." Street. Street. I hadn't had that much fun with my brothers in a long time. It's hot. One isn't enough, two is good, three is perfect. Thank you. But four wasn't in our plan. Dad! Dad? Stop! Right there! Freeze! Don't cross. Don't cross. Are you out of your mind? Do you want to kill me? Is that it? Julia, tell me what the heck is going on. It's all my fault. So explain it to me. What was this idea? I almost gave birth through my armpit when I found out you were here. We decided that since you no longer have a Christmas, we will. Yeah. I don't want to spend Christmas at aunt Zilu's again. And not far from you, from mom and from grandma Nena. So what, you're separated. But we're still a family. And you and mom always said that before you fell in love you were best friends, remember? Yes, I do. Can't you be friends again? Do you have to ruin our Christmas? Explain to me your plan. Why did you sell your iClone to that guy you don't even know? It was brand new. I'd rather have no iClone than no Christmas again. We already have the tree, the gifts, we just need the turkey. And deliver my letter to Santa since someone forgot to do it; right, Marcos Henrique? Go ahead, Cris. I can't stand this anymore. Breathe, I'm here with you. It will be alright. - Tell me something, Sonia. - Yes. What if the children go back inside? They won't. It will be alright. Isn't it better to have a C-section? No, we're monitoring them. The babies are doing great. Any sign of distress we'll go straight into surgery. It takes a while; it's only natural. Natural birth is natural. And with a ball. It's like a present from Santa. When we are children, we never think we'll get it. Just a second. YOU DIDN'T FORGET BIA'S PRESENT, DID YOU? I need to make a quick call. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. Oops. Women do have a sixth sense. Stay here and don't go anywhere, little creatures. Hi, Sonia. Hi, Marcos Henrique. Did you buy your daughter's roller skates? What? The roller skates, Marcos Henrique. That you were supposed to buy. I gave you Santa's letter weeks ago. Marcos Henrique? Marcos Henrique? Hello! Answer me. Don't play stupid. Did you buy it? Of course, I did. Who do you think I am? Of course I did. What kind of father do you think I am? Do you really want me to answer? A father who forgets his daughter's letter to Santa. I'm picking them up at 8. And please, make them take a shower before. - And Marcos Henrique... - Huh? I know I'm asking too much but... In the name of our old friendship. Yes. Can you buy some potato salad for me to bring to aunt Zilu's? Sure. Don't worry. Thank you so much. Hello? Marcos Henrique, are you there? Sonia. I don't know why but I think this will be the best Christmas of our lives. Yes, it will be beautiful. I'll send you a picture. Kisses. Kisses. Can I be part of your plan too? Let's use the rebozo. The scarf. Show it, Natalia. You'll understand. Get up, Cris. Come on. Natalia will explain it to you. - It will help you squat. - Alright. I'll be down here, waiting for you. Breathe. - Juju? - Yes. Help me here. I dropped something. You guys watch the stuff. Come, Juju. I dropped something. Help me here. Watch it. I dropped something. Listen. I need your help. Say it. I... - You? - I... I didn't buy Bia's present. I knew it. My gorgeous! I knew it. She's going to get traumatized. I know. But if you help me, she won't. Help me, Juju. Please, Juju. Help me. Please. You're so childish, Marcos Henrique. Am I? Yes, I am. So? Bia, come here. Look who's there! Santa Claus! Maria Beatriz, come back here. What, Dad? Let's get our stuff first. Listen, guys. Just a second. Do you have the letter with you? Yes, Dad, for hours. So stay here. Mig, please, stay here with your sister. Don't go anywhere. Of course, Dad. Where are you going? We're going... Bia, look at Santa. He's so cute! We're going to look for the turkey. Ah, the turkey. There's a turkey place over there. - Alright? - Sure. Good luck. I hope you find one. Yes, we need luck. Shall we? We'll be right back. - And don't go anywhere! - Alright, alright. Maybe you should pray to find the skates. Saint Anthony, if I find those skates, I'll jump 57 times, plus the 3 I owe from the wallet. Let's close it in 60. Dad! 60 times. - Hello, buddy. - Hi. Do you have the... How do you call it? The Wonderful Child Flying Skates. The ro-ro... Why are you laughing? The Wonderful Child Flying Skates have been sold out for weeks. Another traumatized child this Christmas. I'm so sorry. - Do you think it's funny? - No. Neither do I. Maybe over there. Are you anxious? Yes! - Do you think we can make it? - Yes, don't worry. Attention, please. We have news for you. We've just received a batch with 10. I said only 10 units of the Wonderful Child Flying Skates. One is mine! One is mine! Calm down, guys! Calm down, guys! Calm down! Julia! Excuse me. Dad! That's my girl! Merry Christmas! Thanks, Santa Claus. Merry Christmas to you, too. Go, Bia. What's your name? - Beatriz. - Beatriz. Have you been a good girl? Yes, I've been a great good girl. So I'll leave a present for you at your house, ok? Unfortunately it's not as easy as you think, Santa. Why not? The problem is that our parents have separated and since then, our Christmas, which was the best Christmas in the world, became the lamest Christmas in the solar system. And to make my joy even worse, my parents forgot to give you my letter. Now I don't know if I'll get my present in time. - Did you bring your letter? - Yes, I did. "The Wonderful Child Flying Skates." Ho, ho, ho, ho. Let me check my watch. It's 3:30. I can take orders until 6 pm. Ho, ho, ho, ho! Thanks, Santa Claus. Merry Christmas to you and your family. Ho, ho, ho, ho! And what seemed to be another lame Christmas was becoming one of the best days of our lives. 60! I'm done. I got cramps. Juju. - Come back here. - Yes. What should we do now? Tell me. I've delivered my letter. I'm fine. Now we have to buy the turkey for Mom. Didn't you buy it at the turkey place? No, there was only chicken. Who's excited to go to the store? I am! Get in. So many things to do to have a baby. There are many more. Imagine when they decide to come out. Then we'll be in trouble. Sonia, are your children messy? Yes, very messy. But they're also a lot of fun, affectionate, curious. They make us think differently; they open our mind. A child is our best companion. Now you made me excited. Really? So let us push them out. Look! There are a bunch of spots. It's preferential parking. Exactly. It's better, 'cause it's closer to the door. Over there! - Dad! - What? He took the woman's parking spot. Never do that. Attention, clients. Today we'll be exceptionally closing at 6 pm. We wish everybody a Merry Christmas. What now, guys? Attention, guys. Let's gather here and think of a plan. Team Silva special mission. That's the spirit. The store clothes in 1 hour. We have to work as a team to be able to get everything. - Alright. - Juju, give me the list. - What list? - The shopping list. - What list, Dad? - There is no list? No. My goodness! In my days we used to make shopping lists. Let me think. Let me think of what to do. - Hello, ma'am. How are you? - Hello. - Do you have a minute? - Sure, honey. What is it? Are you shopping for Christmas dinner? Yes, I am. Guess what happened? My daughter-in-law is having twins right now. I know someone who's also having twins right now. - No way! - This in vitro fertilization... - Julia? - Yes. The twins that will be born today, are they Santa's children? No, Bia, they're Christmas presents. I got it. Wow! It turns out that my meniscus got pinched, I couldn't solve it. Do you know what it was? A spirit. I don't believe it. What do you want to know about Christmas dinner? We don't know the ingredients. Could you please let us know? For a complete dinner, you need, turkey, mayonnaise, potato, carrot, flour, oil, sugar, bread... - I'm lost. - Egg threads, rice, raisins, nuts... Yummy! I have to go now or I'll be late. Irene, it was a pleasure to meet you. Thank you. And bathe your feet with horsetails. It's better. Send my regards to everyone. You're great. - Did you memorize it? - Kind of. Rice, potatoes, carrots and onions. - Good. - Egg threads. - Raisins, mayo and guaraná. - Great. Olives, dried fruit, sugar and turkey. Genius! What would I do without you? I don't know. So let's do this. - Juju and I will grab the stuff. - Yes. Miguel will drive the cart. Can I stay inside the cart? You can do anything you want, sweetie. - Go and get the cart. - Let's go, Dad. And we'll grab the food. Egg threads, raisins and mayonnaise.

Should I put it in the truck? No, sweetie. It won't fit in there. Good afternoon. Let's go. The store closes in 20 minutes. Ouch! Yes, Cris. It's going really well. Now push a little harder. Come on. Yes. Excuse me, doctor. I can't now. I'm sorry, but it's your aunt Zilu. She called more than 10 times and said she won't stop until you answer. Do you mind if I use the speakerphone? No problem. I'll rest for a while. - Hello, aunt Zilu. - Sonia? Yes, auntie. Aldinha and I are preparing dinner... Good. What's going on? I'm working. What do you want? Please, hurry. You don't have to be rude. I'm just calling to ask you to be here on time for dinner. And don't forget the potato salad. - Uh-huh. - Aldinha, I'm talking. - I want to talk to her too. - But I'm talking to her. Come on, guys. We have plenty of time, but we need to get organized. - Julia. - Right. Prepare the garnish. Grandma will bake the turkey. Miguel and Bia will decorate the tree. What about you, Dad? I'm thinking of a way to convince your mother. She's not easy. - Help! - Wait, Bia? I can't believe this. Who are you, girl? - Pietra. - Pietra? Where is Bia? Who is Bia? Dad, you brought the wrong child. Oh, no! I can't... My goodness. I'll take you back to your family. Put everything back. We're going back there. Let's do that. We're going back now. She does not even look like Bia. Alright. Saint Anthony, if I find my daughter, I'll jump as many times as you want. My goodness! Let's go, Dad. Darn! Dad, it's closed. What are you doing? You can't park here. Why not? It's prohibited. Guys, it's really quick. Go in, unlock, get out. You're kidding me. Look at the gate! Better this way. Let's go! Hurry. Come on, guys. Please, open! Don't close it yet. Ma'am, please, where are the lost and founds? Lost or founds? One lost and one found. This is a first! First to the right. - Merry Christmas. - We're trying. Come on, guys. Hurry! Get out, Miguel. Go! Go! She was next to you. Bia, my daughter! My daughter! My daughter! My goodness! Are you alright? - We missed you. - I thought so. Please, forgive Dad. Yes, but don't you ever do this again. No, I won't. Daughter! What a scare, ma'am. My goodness! Your daughter is really cute. See you later. Merry Christmas. Let's go. Where do you think you're going? You have no idea of the amount of things we have to do. A lot of things. You're irresponsible. What kind of father doesn't recognize his own daughter? Hold on. This was unexpected. It doesn't happen too often. Remember when you mixed me up with a bag of dirty laundry? Hey! Let's get out of here. What matters is that we're all back here. Sorry for the inconvenience. There was not enough time to get traumatized, right? You have no idea how nervous I was. I'm going to sue you for child abduction and pain and suffering. - It was an accident. - Give me your full name. I still have to bake the turkey. Dad. I'm talking to her. Give me a minute. It was an accident. - Dad? - Wait a second, son. - I need to poo. - What? Poo? Yes, poo. - Poo? - Yes, poo. It's coming out. He has to poo. You'd better get going before you have another accident. Yes. Again, I apologize. Pietra, it was a pleasure. You're very cool. Guys, say goodbye to Pietra. Bye, Pietra. - Bye, auntie. - Let's go, Dad. Let's go. It's not good to hold in poop. Don't let it out. Hold it in. Let's find a bathroom. - I don't need to go anymore. - Wasn't it coming out? He was lying. Miguel is smart. He's not a dummy at all. What? I'm shocked. You fooled me too. I can't believe you. But the fart was real. I could smell it. - No, it wasn't. - I smelled it too. - It was Julia. - No, it wasn't me. - Then it was Bia. - No, it wasn't. Now, let's head to our dinner. What if Pietra's mother took Bia home? Your father is really crazy. You have to exchange me. YOUR VEHICLE HAS BEEN TOWED AWAY Punished for a crime I didn't commit. You knew you couldn't park here. - Where is our car? - Where is our stuff? The tree, the presents, the turkey? Calm down, little guys. I'm going to solve this. I'll call the tow company and they'll understand. - Now I'm really screwed. - What happened now? My cell phone was inside the car with my wallet. - So it means... - My plan didn't work. I'm sorry, guys. It's all my fault. No, son. Look at me. The only one to blame here is me. Yes, Miguel. He's right. It's he's fault and mom's as well. They ruined our Christmas. Let's go back home. We'd better. Before mom finds out and things get worse. Let me call a cab... Let's walk. I cannot even find the strength to cry. And to think that for a moment I thought that the Christmas spirit actually existed. Not even a miracle could save us now. Congratulations, Mom and Dad! Dorinha is here. Congratulations! She's beautiful! The first one was born at 6:50 pm. Enjoy the moment. They grow really fast. You'll never forget this moment. I know it feels really good, but there's someone in here who's dying to get out. Be careful. Careful! Hold the cart. Hold your sister. What are you doing, Dad? Dad? Do you know where the Santa Claus story comes from? It's obvious, from the North Pole. No. It's from a place called Turkey, where many many years ago lived a man known as Nicholas. Dad, why did you get this ladder? Wait. You'll understand. Nicholas was known for secretly helping people in need. - Wait, Dad! - Come! So what did he do? He'd leave a bag of coins in people's chimney and left without being seen. Santa Claus' chimney! Yes, sweetie. - Like this. - Perfect. Exactly, honey. His fame of being a good old man, with the bag full of presents comes from Nicholas, who'd help people without getting anything in return. Did he go out on the street? Of course! He had to buy bread, go to the store... - Was he married? - Yes, to Nicolayla. Wait, Dad. - Sir? Are you throwing this out? - Yes. Do you want it? Yes! Don't even think twice. - Thank you, Sir. - Thanks a lot. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. I'll never complain again when you ask for stuff. You can ask for anything you want. That was cool. Doctor? Excuse me. I need you to sign this. Alright. What time is it? 7:15. Tell Cris I'll send her the birth maps later. Alright. I hope Marcos Henrique has made the children shower. - Merry Christmas. - To you, too. - Say hello to the kids. - Thanks. It was really cool to ride in the cart. I'll do this all the time now. Yes, it was really cool. But we didn't get the turkey. And without turkey, my mom won't eat dinner. You're right. Your mother won't go without turkey on Christmas. Darn! We tried so hard! There's nothing missing now. Please, I can't... I insist. Take it. But what about your Christmas? I don't have a place to bake it. Besides it's too much food for one or two people. Thank you. What's your name? My name is Leon. - And this is Comet. - Hello, Comet. Hello, Comet. Alright, then. Let's go. We have to go. Merry Christmas. - Thanks. - You too. Bye. You saved the Silva's Christmas. Nice meeting you. Hold on. Thank you. - Take care. - Thank you. We're here. Open the door for me, please. Let me open here. Come on, guys. Hold this. Come, guys. Come, Julia. Mom, we brought Christmas! Ho, ho, ho! Grandma! I missed you! Hug grandma. Give me a kiss. That's so nice. Weren't we going to order pizza? We changed our minds. The Silva's Christmas is back at full throttle, Mom! Help us here. Put the turkey in the oven while we get things ready. That's wonderful! Guys, I brought a guest. Good evening. It looks good. You're just like your mother. The chocolate looks really cool hanging in there. My goodness! - I can't answer. - Neither can I. Me neither. Hello? Hello, Mrs. Nena. Merry Christmas. It's Sonia. - Who is it? - It's Sonia. Your ex-daughter-in-law. Ah, Sonia, darling. I'm so glad you came. I'll open the door. No, I'm just here for the child... Is it open? Sonia? I called you 20 times, Marcos. Won't you... What's going on here? - Hi, Mom. - Hi, Mom. Hi. You didn't take a shower. At least you smell good. Sonia, darling. I'm so happy to see you. Merry Christmas, honey. Merry Christmas. Nice to meet you. Leon. - Merry Christmas. - To you too. Go, Dad. Sonia, The thing is... Come to the office with me. I dropped something. What's going on? Come with me. - What did you drop? - There's something... - For me? - Yes. - What is it? - Help me fix something. What's going on? Sonia. Remember how we were before we got married? Why this now? Do you? Yes, I do. What are they talking about? I don't know but I'm afraid. We were always together, the whole day long. People used to call us Batman and Robin. Then Batman and Robin made wonderful children. - Look. - Yes, they're incredible. We've been making their lives harder. For a long time in my life I couldn't imagine living without you. Then we started falling apart more and more. We separated. So many stupid fights. But I realized I don't want this anymore. I want you back next to me like it used to be, my friend, my partner, my socionaut. No one can erase our story. Our children are proof of that. I missed my friend. And I missed my skinny girl. Bear hug? You're asphyxiating me. Batman can't hold back his strength. You know darn well that I'm Batman. By the way, I love you. I love you too. Friends? - Friends forever. - Forever. Sonia, there was a small problem with Bia's roller skate. - I couldn't buy it. - What do you mean? Are we spending Christmas together? Yes. - So let's open the presents. - Yes! Their presents first. - Dad, this is yours. - Mine? Yes. Give me a hug. This is cool. Let's see what it is. I'm sure you're going to like it. Let's see what it is. - This is really well packed. - Yes, we packed it. What's this? Wow! This is cool! A spyglass. It's because I have my head in the clouds. - You got it right. - Very. - Now, yours, Mom. - There's one for me. Of course. - What is it? - What is it? It's beautiful! "To the best mother in the world from the Silvinha Foundation." I love you! You're my darlings. There's also one for grandma Nena. The cutest grandmother. You're the best in the world. Bootlicker. Now it's my turn. Sweetie, Robin, your father, and I need to talk to you about Santa Claus. We know everything. Dad told us about Nicholas. No, sweetie. Nicholas had a small problem this time. He didn't have time to pack your present. That was the problem. I got your letter at the last minute, so he asked me to give you like this. Is that it? My goodness! It's the roller skates! The Wonderful Child Flying Skates. What's going on here? This time I got you. For Miguel, if your parents let me, he asked me to give him Comet. Mom, please! Can I? He's gorgeous! If you bathe him, take him for a walk and clean his poop, you can. Thanks, Mom. And to Julia... But I didn't ask for anything this year. Are you sure? That's when I realized that there was something really special going on with us. As if someone was making sure the Silva's had a happy Christmas again. Guys, hold on. I forgot Christmas at aunt Zilu's. Welcome! Long time no see. Aunt Aldinha and aunt Zilu. You're here! - Ah, honey! - How are you, auntie? Ho, ho, ho, ho! Cousin Silvio! - I only have pies for you. - For you. Come in, Silvio. You already know the joke. Merry Christmas. They're my guests, Marcos Henrique. It's Christmas, guys! A family celebration. - Smile. - I'm smiling inside. The potato salad! Now we're talking. Let's do something. I'll bring the turkey. It looks nice. The turkey is here. On the table! Happy Birthday... I'm joking. Are you crazy? It's a little small, but it's good. Eat the salad, auntie. Remember our turkey last year? Ah, you weren't there. I wasn't invited. It was huge. What matters is that we're together. Have some eggs, auntie. Aren't you going to eat? And this is how a Christmas that was supposed to go wrong became our best Christmas ever. That's what I had asked for. Everyone together again. And no matter what, the Silva's had their Christmas again. At least until next year. Ho, ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho, ho! Is it snow? It's snow! Ho, ho, ho, ho! THE END I feel cold, I feel, cold, I feel cold I have butterflies in my stomach The year is almost over Christmas is almost here - She's going to break her leg. - She needs an adventure! - Stop it. - No. You can hurt yourself. - What is her shoe size? - Look. I'm fine, Mom. I'm going to borrow the skates from her. No, you won't. Behave. Where's the dog? Once a year, time stops And we look back And notice She always does that. Always, every party is the same thing. She drinks a glass of wine and falls asleep on the couch. I'm cold, I'm cold I'm cold I have butterflies in my stomach The year is almost over Christmas is almost here Nena has the last piece. What are you doing? I didn't raise you like that. That's not nice. Stealing from his own mother. I'm cold, I'm cold I'm cold I have butterflies in my stomach The year is almost over Christmas is almost here This is the day, this is the day, this is the day - That's funny. - I have a much better one. Do this with your teeth. - Now do this. - No. Isn't this one good? What about both together? Cutie. You are. Cutie. - Cutie. - Cutie. - Cutie. - Cutie. Through the love filter Through the love filter Let's make a toast. To our children. To our friendship. No one can beat us.
