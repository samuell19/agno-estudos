BAD EDUCATION written and directed by Enrique Goded "The current spell of icy weather has claimed its first victim. A motorcyclist froze to death on Highway 4 and drove for a further 90 km after he was dead. Two patrolmen flagged him down and as he didn't react they pursued him. They drove alongside and rebuked him for his attitude. As he didn't move they realized something was wrong." It seems incredible. It's a wonderful image. A dead young man drives his motorcycle across the icy plain, escorted by two patrolmen. Where was he going in that icy dawn? To see someone who couldn't wait until the morning. There's a story here! I'll cut it out and keep it, it might inspire me. I'll get it. - Hello. - What is it? I'm an actor. I'm looking for Enrique Goded. He isn't here. But I can see him, man. In any case, we don't have any projects, so … I'd like to speak to him. We were old pals at school. I'm Ignacio Rodríguez. - All right, come in. - Thank you. - I don't think he'll see you. - That's all right. Wait a minute. He's an actor, a nuisance! I told him we aren't preparing a film now. - Tell him I'm not in. - I did, but he saw you. And I can see him. He said he was a friend of yours at school. - Who can he be? - Ignacio Rodríguez. Ignacio? - It can't be! - That's what he said. Ignacio, is it really you? Of course, Enrique. - I'm delighted you remember me! - How could I forget you? Well, it's been sixteen years. - That long? - More or less. I wouldn't recognize you with that beard. You'd look better without it. Come into my office. - You want a coffee? - No, thanks. - I'm having one. - Then, yes. - Martín, will you make some coffee? - Yes. Sit down. What brings you here? I came to ask for work. I'm an actor. I've brought my resumé. - Bumblebee Group. - An independent theater company. "El Retablillo de San Cristóbal" by García Lorca. "The Diary of Adam and Eve", by Mark Twain Mark Twain, García Lorca … Only the best for the Bumblebee. Don't you write anymore? No, I stopped ages ago. But I've brought my last story. "THE VISIT" by Ignacio Rodríguez "The Visit"… By the way, when are you starting your next film? - Well … - I'll do anything. We're eyeing tabloids to see if I can think of stories. You've caught me in a creative crisis. That's a bummer! Read my story, it might give you some ideas. What's it about? Our school. One part is based on our childhood, and the other part isn't, when the characters grow up. That's fiction. I haven't introduced you. Ignacio, Martín … Pleased to meet you. - Sugar and milk? - Yes, please. By the way, I don't call myself Ignacio now. I'm Angel. Why's that? It's my stage name. An actor can't be called Ignacio Rodríguez. - He can't? - Of course not. Angel Andrade. Everyone calls me that, even my mother. That's great. Thank you. - Ignacio was … - Angel! - Ignacio … - Angel! Well, Ignacio, before he became Angel, was … is an old school friend. Martín is my production director. And maid of all work. - Well, Ignacio … - Angel! Right! I'm delighted to see you. As soon as I've got anything … Give me your number, I'll call you. I don't have a phone. But I'll call you. - Should I leave you another photo? - No, don't worry. Well, Angel, it was great seeing you. - So should I go? - Yes, I think so. - Can't I help you cut out …? - No, thanks a lot. - So long. - My pleasure. You look great! So do you. - Do read "The Visit". - Yes, I will. - I'm dying of curiosity. - Great. See you. I thought he'd never leave! - Is he really a friend of yours? - Yes. I haven't seen him since school. We were really close. Well, he was my first love. But he's changed a lot. I didn't recognize him. Will you see him again? It seemed that you liked him. No, there's nothing less erotic than an actor looking for work. "The Visit". Ever since we started touring with the show, "The Bomb" I've been waiting for this moment. Today we're playing in the town where I went to school. I won't mention its name so as not to promote it. I owe my best memories to the Olympo Cinema which is now in ruins. "THE BOMB" Card. - I'm fucking sick of losing! - Then clear off. Take a break. Thank you. She defines herself as a mix of desert, hazard, and cafeteria. She's a great artiste and a great friend of mine. With all of you, our next act, the mystery and the fascination of the one and only, the inimitable, Zahara! A bit of applause, for Crissake! - So … - What? - Listen … - I'll see you at the hostel. - Yeah, but … - Paquito, you heard me. You've got time for everything, fag. Monda! Wait for me, love! Hello. - What's wrong? - I can't find my keys. May I help you? Sure. No, they're not here. Let's see. Not here either. Here they are! My lips are wearing out! I drank too much. You're telling me. Hey! I'm sucking your dick! He's out cold! A kid. Not a cent. A lottery ticket. I'll keep that. Don't start the engine right outside. But he's passed out! Well hung, isn't he? He's not bad. And look, he's still hard! Love … - Let me suck him off a bit. - No, you've got things to do. You've been at him for hours. Look at your lip! Come on, the bike won't run away. Shut up! Now, go hide the bike. Hurry back, I'll see you in your room before 7:00. Sure, I get all the dirty work and you have all the fun. Now you get a hard-on, asshole! It's not fair! Enrique Serrano. Enrique! Paquito! Come up here! What about the bike? Leave it there. Come up. There's nothing like loading up on drugs and on hormones to end up as crazy as you, bitch. The keys! We're not stealing the bike! Why not? We've got a buyer. I'll explain later. I'll meet you to go to mass. - So we're going to the school? - Yes, now more than ever. - I'm flipping out, bitch! - I bet. Dear Enrique, It's me, Ignacio. I've dreamed so much of this moment! Years have gone by but I've never forgotten you. We have to meet again, but when you're not plastered. I want to tell you about my life and hear about yours while we eat a cream cake in the Mallol Patisserie, like when we got out of school on weekends. I'm not going to complicate your life. I know you're married and have a child. I know that you live in the next town, that you're broke and that I'd like to help you. Right now, I'm working on something, but I'll explain it all in the patisserie. I'll wait for you from 6:00 to 7:00. Do come! I adore you. Ignacio. - Yes? - I miss you. Have you unpacked all the boxes? Not even half of them. Do you need a hand? I don't mind, really. It's best if you don't, Martín. Thanks. Can I call you later? - I'm reading. - Oh, do forgive me. Don't be so fucking touchy! - I'll call you in a while. - Do that, even if it's late. We saw Sara's first films here. And "Breakfast at Tiffany's" Enrique and I groped each other for the first time here. My knees are trembling just thinking about it. I'm meeting him at 6:00 in the patisserie. Don't get your hopes up. Remember, he's married. If Fr. Manolo hadn't separated us … What's he got to do with it? A lot, everything! That priest owes me a lot and it's time for him to pay. I hate seeing you like this. You got anything left? What? Speedball. C'mon, let's have some! - Here? - Of course. They haven't rolled out the streets yet. Oh, fag! Come on. A nailful for my gal Paca. One more. I believe in couples. Two fucks, two bumps, two "amigas". "Two Rode Together", "Two For The Road". You're such a pig! Right, let's go to school! Gee up, girl! Come on, best foot forward. This was my school. I'm worn out. Have you anything left? Be quiet. It's started. The God of hope who, by the grace of the Holy Spirit, fills us with His joy and peace … That's Fr. Manolo. - He looks so old! - Well, he's no chicken. I guess. Zahara, this is crazy! Are you backing out, bitch? But the chapel is tiny, there's nowhere to hide. When he sees us appear, he'll do what Christ did to the buyers in the temple. He drove them out with a whip, and he was Christ! So this man who, according to you, is so imperfect … I confess to God, the Father Almighty, and to you, my brethren, that I have sinned through thought, word, deed and omission. Through my fault. - Through your fault. - Through my fault. Through your fault. Through my most grievious fault. So I beseech the Blessed Mary, ever virgin, the angels, the saints, and you, my brethren, to intercede for me before Our Lord God. Almighty God, have mercy on us, forgive us our sins and lead us to eternal life. Through Jesus Christ Our Lord. We'll see. The Lord be with you. I could use Him. May the blessing of Almighty God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit descend upon you. You may go in peace. I hope so! Go back to the dormitory and sleep a bit more. Thank you, Father. If I'm in the sacristy for too long, don't wait. We'll meet at the hostel for lunch, sweetheart. Cute. Divine! Good morning, Fr. Manolo. What do you want? You can't come in here! I'm the sister of an ex-pupil, Ignacio Rodríguez. You still can't come in here! Don't you remember him? We've had a lot of pupils. But no one like Ignacio, I'm sure. I've brought an important message from him. He can give it to me himself. He can't. He died in an accident. I'm sorry. Now, please go. Go away! - Hide! - I've got it all! Hide, he's coming! Ignacio … I told you to leave! What are you doing here? The same as you, remembering Ignacio. Get out! We have to talk, Father. It'll only take a minute. Say what you have to say and go! Are we going to talk in the dark? I don't mind. I'm used to working in the dark. What do you want? A better life and a better body. What do I have to do with those improvements? You could help me finance them. I don't believe Ignacio is dead or that you're his sister. I don't even believe you're a woman. Are you locking me in? I don't want anyone coming in by mistake. And now, tell me why you're here! OK. I'll get to the point. It's a story by Ignacio. Yes, he took your advice and kept on writing. I've got a friend, a pig, who works at "Diario 16". He's very interested in publishing this story. But first I'd like your opinion. Apart from being Ignacio's literature teacher you're one of the main characters in this story. Read this. Each month, the boys who got on the honors board, that is, the ones who got the best grades, were rewarded with a day in the country. We were always accompanied by our literature teacher, Fr. Manolo. Moon River, always on my mind. I won't be swept away by the water, the muddy water of that Moon River as it flows along. River and moon, tell me where to find my God, and good and ill. Tell me. I'm longing to know what is hidden in the dark and you'll find it … No! A trickle of blood divided my forehead in two. I had a feeling the same thing would happen with my life. It would always be divided and I couldn't help it. Open the door, Father. It is I. - What is it? - There's been a robbery. - Where? - In the chapel. I think it was after your mass. Were you missing anything? The chalice, the paten, the jug, the cruets … They must be found! - The boys mustn't hear about it. - Very well. And no one is to bother me, except you. Was that Fr. José? Ignacio hated him. - Does he still hit the pupils? - He never laid a hand on Ignacio. That was the principal's privilege. To sum up, I want a million in cash. Or else "Diario 16" will publish the whole story. I don't have a million pesetas, much less in cash. But you can get it. Now, if you don't mind, I'm leaving. I've said all I had to say. But keep reading, it gets better. - The key. - Wait. Wait until after break time. It'll just be a minute. So you came to blackmail me. Tell Ignacio he's overrating these pages. They're garbage! Garbage is hot! You and I make a best-selling couple. And the editor of "Diario 16" knows that. You're in no position to threaten anyone. People will believe me, not you. No, people have changed. This is 1977. This society puts my freedom above your hypocrisy. If we treated Ignacio so badly, why did he come back? Why didn't he report us or change schools? He came back 'cause he'd fallen in love, with a classmate. Enrique Serrano. Remember him? Yes. Do you mind if I keep reading? There were lots of celebrations at school. The most important one was Principal's Day. That day, there were sports competitions and religious acts, and we had a special meal. Come with me, Ignacio. Come along! - I haven't finished. - You'll sing better that way. Do you know the new words? Yes, I've got the crib Fr. Manolo gave me. Call him Reverend Principal. He's the school principal from today. - I know. - Don't answer back. When you're singing, keep looking at him, as if there were no one else in the dining room. - You understand? - Yes. Fr. José placed me in the center of the dining room. I felt odd in front of all those priests drinking and eating, and I was a bit scared, but they all looked at me kindly, except Fr. Manolo who looked ready to cry. And now, Fr. José Manuel, as a birthday gift, Ignacio is going to sing one of your favorite songs. "Torna A Sorrento". The new words, "Gardener", were written by Fr. Manolo, helped by my humble self. When you're ready, Ignacio. Gardener, gardener, night and day among your flowers, setting fire to their colors with the flame of your love. And you place in every calyx the smile of your yearning, with your eyes turned up to heaven where all your hopes reside. And your flowers, gardener, with their corollas burning brightly join together in gratitude and embalm you with their scent. Continue with your labor, cultivating all the flowers entrusted to your love by the Lord. - I thought you didn't like me. - No, just the opposite! But every time I looked at you, you looked away. Because you made me nervous. - And now I don't? - No. "THAT WOMAN" Come in. May I help you? Don't you recognize me, Mother? Has the world changed me so much? Mother Soledad! What are you doing here? - I've come to stay. - To stay? Sara is so beautiful! In this house? No. Never. It's been a long time. Who can remember if I did something I shouldn't have? It's impossible. It is not God who rejects you. It is I, in the name of my Order. - What's wrong? - I can't sleep. Neither can I. What we did in the cinema wasn't right. - I liked it. - So did I. But I think it was a sin, and God's going to punish us. God? I don't believe in God. - What do you believe in? - I'm a hedonist. - What's that? - People who like having fun. I read it in an encyclopedia. What's the matter? You hear that? Fr. Manolo! Open the door! Or must I break it down and let the whole school know what you're doing? Ignacio! I know you're in there! I've seen your feet. I can hear you breathing. Ignacio! We're not doing anything! Get out! I'll deal with you later! I'm not leaving Ignacio alone with you. How dare you! Get out of here immediately! Enrique, please. Do as he says. Come here. What were you doing in there? Nothing. Nothing? I swear, Father. Then why was the door locked? Come along. Come with me to the chapel. The bell! What are you thinking of? I think I've just lost my faith at this moment, so I no longer believe in God or hell. As I don't believe in hell I'm not afraid, and without fear I'm capable of anything. We'll forget this, Ignacio. Even if I wanted to, I can't stay angry with you. But promise that what happened tonight won't happen again. And Enrique? What about him? Will he be punished? I should expel him! I'm sure he was responsible for it all. No, I was. Don't cry. He's a very bad influence on you. I want what's best for you. If you don't expel him I'll do what you want. Hush. I sold myself for the first time in that sacristy to avoid Enrique being expelled. But Fr. Manolo tricked me. I swore that one day I'd make him pay for that. On your feet! Hands behind your head! And, one! Change! Hurry up, Enrique! We'll miss the bus! I'm happy you came! - You're better without the beard. - Thank you. What are you doing? I'm re-reading your story. - Didn't you like it the first time? - Of course! Just look at it. I couldn't help making notes. Force of habit. That's OK, it's your copy. Thanks. Right, well … How can I put this? I think there's a good film in this story and I'd like to direct it. Really? You're not kidding me? I never joke about work. But first, tell me how much you want for the rights. What rights? The story is yours! Do what you fucking want with it! So you really liked it? I admit that when you said it was based on our childhood I felt … a bit apprehensive. But I was very touched. I'm so happy, man. Remember I'm an actor and I want out of Bumblebee. Yes, I know that. You'd be perfect as Enrique Serrano, naked on the bed, with Zahara's letter on the pillow. Enrique Serrano? I think I'd rather play Zahara. Zahara, you? You're crazy! - Why? - Well … You're too well-built. You're not right. Martín, we've got our story! I can slim down! I can get into the part! I'm used to that in the theater. Like De Niro … Make a photocopy. "The Visit"? Yes. Ignacio and I are starting on the script. If you're going to direct it, it's best if you write it yourself. All right, Ignacio. Angel! Start calling me Angel, or you'll never get used to it. Do you mind driving? I'm a bit shaky. I'm surprised you can even walk, with all you've taken. We had to celebrate, right? I thought we'd be talking about the project. We'll talk later. We've got time. Remember? Remember what? Nothing. You're really high. What should I remember? Nothing. Turn off here. Is all this yours? No, no way. I've just rented it. Don't be too impressed, it's a mess inside. How about a swim? It would do you good. How's the water? It's waiting for you. "THE PEARL" Will you pass me a cigarette? You weren't serious about playing Zahara, were you? Totally. I don't joke about work either. Then let's not talk about work. What are you doing? Sleeping here or going back to Madrid? If you want, I'll stay. But, talking about bodies, if I look too manly I can slim down. I'm very flexible, I can do anything. You disconcert me, Angel. You told me that already. And you told me about slimming down. Why don't we just talk clearly? I can't say it any more clearly! I'm an actor. I spent three fucking years doing shit with Bumblebee. This is my first chance to get a terrific part and I won't let it slip away. You can't do Zahara. Not at first sight, but give me time! You're a good director, and I'll do anything! You just have to trust both of us. I've tried. But I can't trust you. Why? I just can't recognize the Ignacio I knew at school. The one who loved "Cuore Matto", and so many other things. My tastes have changed. Is that what bothers you? People change with time. Not you. Simply, you're not Ignacio. Who the fuck are you to decide who I am or who I'm not? How dare you? Why am I not Ignacio? Because I don't remember a song from years ago? - Apart from that. - Because I'm not sucking your dick? If I'd stayed like the kid you knew, I'd be dead now. I already am. Dead tired. I'm going to bed. What are you doing? I don't know. You tell me. Tell you what? If I'm going to play Zahara. Does your staying depend on that? No. But if I don't play Zahara there's no film. Then I don't know why you're here, cock teaser. Get out! Why the hell did I decide to see you again, fucking faggot! "A woman threw herself into a pool of hungry crocodiles in a zoo that was crowded with visitors at the time. When the first crocodile attacked, the woman hugged it, according to witnesses. The crocodiles devoured the body of the woman, who never complained, in a few minutes." What a horrible death! Well … She didn't even open her mouth. What's on your mind? Hungry crocodiles. Hello, come in. It's the journalist. Why are you here? To interview me? No. Well, yes. Which is it, cutie? I'm not a journalist, I'm an actor. And I'd like you to help me prepare a character. What character? A tranny who imitates Sara Montiel, among others. That's me! Why don't they give me the part? Well, you're not an actor, you're just a faggot. What you have to learn is how to be polite, because that's no way to treat a lady! I'm sorry. So will you teach me? And how will you pay me, honey? That's what I'm looking for! Two minutes! We'll talk later. I'm on now. Everything you do is great for me. I'm delighted. See you later. "THE PEARL" Ortigueira, 6 miles. "THE PEARL HOSTEL" - What can I get you? - A beer. Forgive me for asking, but how did you get that lighter? - You're not from here. - I stole it from a friend. His family lives here. Maybe you know him. His name is Angel Andrade. Yes. - That's his stage name. - Sure I know him. - You do? - Yes, very well. That's great. Who is it? Enrique. I was at school with Ignacio. Go away or I'll call the police! Excuse me. Are you Enrique Goded? Yes. I'm Ignacio's mother. I'm delighted to meet you. - Come in. - Thank you. Forgive my sister-in-law. I've got the heart problem, but she's the one gets scared. It doesn't matter. Ignacio talked a lot about you. - We were very good friends. - I know. The last time he came to see me he wrote you a letter. A letter? I never got it. It was three years ago. He didn't know your address, he sent it to the Ministry of Culture. Then I'm not surprised. By the time it was returned, he was dead. Let's go into the dining room. That's my son Juan. The younger boy. He's in the theater. He's changed his name. He says there are too many Juans. He wants even me to call him Angel. I'd like to see Ignacio's room. To be honest, he didn't really have a room. But when he came, he liked to use the attic. Would you like to see it? We're going upstairs! Juan burned everything. The notebooks, the clothes … All except those magazines. There's nothing left of what Ignacio wrote? What a pity! Are you from a publisher too? What publisher? Soon after Ignacio died, a man came who was in charge of publishing young authors, or so he said. He was desperate to get his hands on Ignacio's stories. Do you remember his name, or the publisher's? No, but he was very insistent. So I told the truth, that Juan had burned everything, and he even asked for Juan's address. I gave him a false one, of course. I think that man was half mad. This is Ignacio's letter. It didn't get burned because I never told Juan it had been returned. Thank you, ma'am. Don't judge my Juan. He's a good son, but his brother's death really hit him. He was the one who found him. Dear Enrique, At last I've got news of you. I read it in the papers. You've directed your first film, man. Even if it was underground. And to think I was the film buff! You'll be pleased to hear I'm still writing. I'm enclosing a story that would make a divine film. Fr. Manolo inspired it. It's incredible, but I ran into him the other day in Valencia. I'm visiting my mother now, but I live in Valencia. I've checked up, he isn't a priest anymore. He calls himself by his last name, Berenguer. He works in a publisher's, he's married and has a son. I thought: He's crying out to be blackmailed! So I wrote "The Visit", the story I'm sending you. Read it, please. At this point in my life, I need a lot of money and I'm going to get it from that fucker! He owes me a lot, and it's time for him to pay. Write to me and I'll tell you the rest of the story. All I'm asking is to hear from you. I can only share this story with you. I love you. Your Ignacio. I'll get it. What do you want? I've come to apologize. I'll give you your shorts. You left them behind. Thank you. I'm very sorry about what I said. I take it all back. If you're still interested, "The Visit" is yours. Do it with whoever and however you want. Have you lost weight? Yes. I'm really working at it. I want to lose even more. And I'm taking classes. - Classes in what? - In how to be a queen. I'm working with the best Sara Montiel impersonator. She performs at "Bámbola", a gay club. I'm working as a waiter there so I can study the queens more closely. Then you're still thinking about Zahara. Yes. Just let me do an audition. Thank you. - You had it! - Yes, you left that behind too. Ignacio, I'd like to talk … Until you call me Angel, I won't believe you're taking me seriously. Angel, I'm sure you're a good actor, now more than ever. So you'll let me audition? The audition worked for several months, long enough for me to throw myself into the shooting of "The Visit", like the woman who threw herself to the crocodiles and hugged them as they ate her. You've changed the ending. Yes. "The Visit" can't end happily, like your story. Why? Zahara can't just walk out of the school. She's a danger to the priests. And we know what the Church is capable of. But this ending is really heavy, man. For you, as an actor, it's much more interesting. - You think so? - Of course. I shot "The Visit" as a homage to Ignacio. In his letter, he'd said he'd love to see it on the screen. And also to discover the enigma of Juan. He allowed me to penetrate him frequently, but only physically. We were about to finish shooting and his mystery was still intact. But on the last day we had a visit. Silence! And … roll camera! Rolling! "The Visit", 91, 1, first take. Zahara, darling! Action! The boys are in class and I'm sick of arguing. Let me out! Do you want to kidnap me? Open the door! I have to take a piss, buy cigarettes, get a fix! Even if I got the money, how can I be sure you won't blackmail me again? You'll never be sure. That's my revenge. Let me out or I'll scream. I loved Ignacio. You don't love a boy of ten. You harass him, you abuse him! I loved him. Please, let me out! I'm locked in! She's threatening to denounce us. She wants a million pesetas to keep quiet. If you give her a single peseta, you'll never stop paying. I knew we'd meet again, scum! You know her? You knew him much better than I did. It's Ignacio Rodríguez. Ignacio! It can't be! We have to finish him off. He's a danger to the whole congregation! He wants to say something. Yes, that we let him go. If you're going to kill me, I'd like to confess first. Confess what? Thanks to you we've got no way out. You have to stay calm. I'll get rid of the body. How? It's best if you know nothing. It was self-defense. He'd have made our lives impossible. Yes, I guess so. And there are no witnesses. God. Yes, but He's on our side. Cut! We've cut, guys! This one's good. What about the other one? Give me No. 1 as well. Well done, guys. No, it was great. Is anything wrong? I'll see you later. It went really well. Put that down! Who are you? The villain in your film. Fr. Manolo! Mr. Berenguer. I'm not even a father to my own son now. Get out! I read in a magazine that you were here. Go and drink some hot milk with honey, and an aspirin, and leave me alone. I've got a lot to do, I can't waste time on you. Not even to find out how Ignacio died? Or who killed him? And if it coincides with your film? Say what you have to say and go. I was living in Valencia. I worked for a publisher that promoted young writers. Three years ago, I received a story called "The Visit", signed by Ignacio Rodríguez. Ignacio Rodríguez is calling about the new writers anthology. Didn't you tell him he was rejected? Yes, but he insists on speaking to you. He's on your line. - Mr. José Manuel Berenguer? - Yes. - I preferred Fr. Manolo. - Excuse me? - Are you the author of "The Visit"? - Yes. We decided not to include it in "Short Stories of the 80s" - I'm sorry. - You and I have to talk. I think not. I've got nothing more to say. But I do. I went to St. John's School. You were my literature teacher, and you were madly in love with me. I remember how you'd embrace me from behind while you declared your love. I can't believe you've forgotten. I remember the buttons on your soutane digging into my backbone. Have you really forgotten? I'll expect you at my house at 7:00. My address is on the back of the envelope, Fr. Manolo. Push the door. It's just stuck. That wasn't the Ignacio you and I loved. Hello, Mr. Berenguer. I'm Ignacio. Please, come in. Yes, I'm a junkie, but I want to quit and I thought you could help me. Well, I know a clinic. So do I, but first I want to fix myself up a bit. I know I've got divine tits, but everything else … Anyway, I won't get into that. Looking pretty costs a lot of money, Fr. Manolo. I think a million would do it. A million? Yes, in cash, and my lips are sealed. I won't say a word. You're out of your mind! Sexual harassment is frowned upon, Fr. Manolo. What would your wife think, or your boss? You're in no position to blackmail anyone. I could have you arrested tonight. Very well. You call the police, I'll call your wife and the media. A blackmailer can't be as defenseless as you are. Believe me, I know what I'm saying. Juan, go back to your room. I want to watch TV. Watch it later, we're talking business. I don't mind if he stays. I'm sure you don't. He's my brother, he's looking after me. Or that's my mother's idea. I'm Mr. Berenguer. One million, end of story. Do you want me to call him Juan, or Angel? The blackmail became an investment for me. I visited the brothers frequently so I could keep seeing Juan. Remember Don Narciso, the Nazi? He loved my illustrations. Look at this one. And there's another one … Look, this is beautiful. And this one … - "Children of Spain". - I brought you this. I kept Ignacio happy with small amounts of money. And I kept stalling him. I desired Juan, more and more every day. Hello. You brought the dough? I can only give you 50,000. You said you'd bring the million! I said they'd tell me today if I'd get the loan. They said yes, but they have to check my guarantees. I need another three weeks. Another three weeks! I'm a junkie. Haven't you noticed? I could be dead in three weeks. - Are you going away? - Obviously! I want to see my mother before I check in. She has to see me with these teeth and this face, and it's your fault! Don't be unfair, Ignacio, I'm doing what I can. Then do more! I'll be gone for a week. When I come back I want that million. If you don't have it, you'll be sorry. I'm sick of being put off! I'll try to hurry them up, but … Father! Come along. Shall I help you? Sure, take the Olivetti, it's the heaviest. While you're at it, take this too. Stop that taxi. - Bye, Father. - Goodbye. Open the trunk, please. My scarf! Excuse me. I've come for my scarf. I must have left it here. - Fuck, it's really soft! - Silk. It's yours. To be honest, I left it here for you. Cut it out, I'm not Ignacio! Fortunately. What time is it? 12:30. Did he give you anything for me? Ignacio? No. Fuck! I had to pay my school fees today. Are you studying? Yes. Drama. I'm an actor. Selfish bastard! He knew I had to pay today and he didn't give me anything. Obviously, I paid his fees. I hadn't told Ignacio, but the bank had granted me a loan of two million. I withdrew the first million. I told my wife I was going to a conference abroad. She didn't believe me. I guess that doesn't interest you. Not in the least. How did Ignacio die? The week Juan and I spent alone was the happiest in my life. Every day I bought him something. Clothes, a walkman, a Super-8 camera. I enjoyed the gifts more than he did. Take off your shirt. Take it off. Now it's my turn! Now, take that off. Show me your cock. If you're going to shoot my dick, don't show my face! Too late. I can't …! You! Give me some dough! I've got the fucking sweats. - How's mom? - She had another heart attack. But she's all right now. I'm the one who's sick. The dough! - More! - That's all I have. I want that million now! No more excuses! No more stalling and no more gifts. Mom! How are you, Juan? Has Ignacio arrived? Yes. What happened this time? The usual thing, son, but … He stole my pension, and I'd just gotten it! - Is that true? - Yes, love, it is. Tell auntie I'll send her some money. He promised me he was going into a clinic. And you believed him? Yes, this time he really means it. He's going to try. - You have to help him. - How? By being with him. Don't leave him. Promise me. I promise. Listen, did he give you the cheese and the chorizos? Delicious! Why did you bother? There's food in Valencia. Don't spend your money. They're your favorites. I'd kept them for you. - You can't get them in Valencia. - All right, thanks. - Lots of love, son. - Yes, call me if anything happens. Don't worry, I will. Bye. Where's Ignacio? I'm going to kill him! It was Juan's idea. Or mine, I don't know. The only solution was to get rid of him. More or less what you've just shot. But not as violent. How did you think of it? Ignacio's story doesn't end like that. While I was adapting it, I found out that Ignacio was dead. Did Juan tell you? I found out myself. Will you just tell me how it happened? I arranged to meet Juan at the Museum of Giant Figures. He had it all planned out. Much more than it seemed at first. I'll buy the junk and you give it to him. Why me? Fuck, he's my brother! I'm not a monster. Do you think this doesn't hurt me? But he's ruining all our lives. What will we do afterwards? We won't meet for a while. Why? You said there'd be no investigation. Just in case. It's best not to arouse suspicion. I'll go and look after my mother, she'll need it. When things calm down, I'll call you and we'll go away. - Have you got the money? - Yes. What will I do while I'm waiting? Work, earn money. We'll need it. The situation at home is unbearable. Apologize to your wife and enjoy your son. - Tell her the truth. - What? Say you've been with someone else, a woman. Give me your mother's address. It's best if I don't. Then you won't be tempted to come see me. What are they laughing at? They're laughing at us. At me, at least. Juan bought deadly pure heroin. He gave it to me and I went to Ignacio's. Alone. Dear Enrique: I think I've succeeded … This is my last fix. What do you mean? I'm quitting. This time I really am. Before I get my face and all the rest done, I'm checking into a detox clinic. I've already applied. Good. You'll have the money tomorrow. I hope so. Before noon, OK? Just in case, I wrote two letters, one for the publisher and the other for your wife, telling all you've hidden from them in the past and present. - That's unnecessary. Give them to me! - When I get the money. Before noon. Pretty, aren't they? What? My tits. Yes, they're wonderful. Thank you. Shall I help you? Go away. I don't like fixing in front of you. It's done. Pull in here. We'll go to the cinema to kill time. "FILM NOIR WEEK" It's as if all the films were talking about us. Now what? I'm going home. - You want me to go with you? - No, you'd better not. Remember to get those two letters. If you don't we'll be in trouble. I'll get everything, don't worry. If we won't be seeing each other for a while, give me some of the Super-8s. It would console me to see us screwing. You're nuts! What if your wife saw them? We have to burn them. I'll take care of that. Let's go. Get in for a minute. No, I'm going to take a taxi. Then, I won't see you again … It's just for a few days. Call me as soon as you can. Yes. What's wrong? You! At last! I read in this film magazine that you were here. What did you tell him? Everything. - Now you only have me, darling. - You're crazy. Remember I've got my brother's letters, accusing you of his death. - We both did it, my love. - The letters only mention you. Wait! - Are you all right? - Leave me alone! If I ever see you again, I swear I'll kill you! Now that I've found you, I won't let you go. Get used to the idea. Mónica! - Can you give me a lift? - Sure. Get in the front. - Who was that? - Someone looking for Enrique. Who is it? It's me. Give me back the keys. Your things are in the hall. Take them away. The taxi's gone. You'll have to lend me the car or drive me back to Madrid. I want to order a taxi. 11, Avenida del Agua. Enrique Goded, yes. Thank you. I was going to tell you after the shoot. Tell me what? That my name is Juan. That I'm Ignacio's brother and Ignacio died four years ago. I knew that already. I know that you knew. What do you mean? My mother rang to tell me you'd been to the house. I guessed you'd learned everything. When you asked for the audition, you knew that I knew? Yes. And you still kept pretending? What else could I do? I didn't lie, you knew everything. No, I didn't, far from it. I knew you'd taken Ignacio's place and that he was dead, but I never imagined that you'd killed him! That's the taxi. I didn't kill him, Berenguer did! Ignacio was blackmailing him. And you were hustling him! The taxi's waiting. You don't know what it is to have a brother like that and live in a small town. Juan, the taxi is waiting. Why did you choose me? You still don't see me as Zahara. Was it just to fuck me? It was curiosity. I wanted to see how far you would go and how much I could take. I would go a lot further. I bet you would. You needn't explain any more. It's not mine. It's from Ignacio. Dear Enrique: I think I've succeeded … "After the release of "The Visit" Angel Andrade became the top heart throb. His reign lasted for ten years. In the '90s, his career suffered ups and downs. He married Mónica, the wardrobe girl. At present, he works solely on TV series." "Mr. Berenguer (formerly Fr. Manolo) didn't vanish from the life of Angel Andrade (Juan). He started asking for money and blackmailing him. One night, he was run down and killed by a car that didn't stop. The car was driven by Angel Andrade." "Enrique Goded is still making films with the same passion."
