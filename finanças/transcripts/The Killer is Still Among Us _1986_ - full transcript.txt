- Hey, I think I saw someone. - Relax, there's nobody. You're always seeing things. Besides, I'm here to protect you. - Come on, let's make love. - OK. - Hello? - Cristiana? - Hi, Chiara. What time is it? - It's eight. - The killer struck again last night. - What? Probably the same guy from that double murder you're doing your dissertation on. It's another couple killed while making love. - I'm sure it's the same maniac. - Hold on a second, I'm still half-asleep. - Another murdered couple, you said? - Yeah, my dad is already on the scene. Some police guy hauled him out of bed. I'll give you the location. All right, I'm on my way. Thank you. Come on. Come on, search. Good dog. I have to tell Chiara to stop babbling everything to you. Me and Chiara are good friends, Professor. Besides, you know I've been studying the 1974 case for my dissertation. I must know if we're dealing with my killer. "Your killer"? You'd throw your dissertation away if you had seen these two poor bodies. I'd never expect you to talk like this, Professor. You taught me a criminologist must study a murder in depth. That's what it takes to understand and prevent further crimes. Yes, yes, naturally you have reason. It's just that I don't think it's a good idea to study this case for your degree. - Professor? - Yes? We found this. Ah yes, a common medication used to restore the balance of the nervous system Anything you might want to note down on the killer's psychological profile? Of course, Inspector. Allow me to introduce you my best student, Cristiana Marelli. - Pleased to meet you. - Charmed. - Where are they taking them? - Forensic science laboratories. Doctor Alex, please show her the two bodies from last night. A pretty girl like yourself is interested in the dead? Standard training for a surgeon. Pretty much the same for an aspiring criminologist. - Follow me. - Yeah. - Where are the bodies from last night? - Drawer two and three. - Seen enough? - Yes. - I looked like a fool. - Oh no, don't worry about that. Just imagine the number of bodies I see every day. But the state those two kids were in, well, it almost made me puke my guts out. - Hey, you like gialli? - Yeah. I got two tickets for tonight. Before we take this any further, you must meet my parents first. Well, if you put it like that, I give in. Good, I'm counting on it. My mom will find you adorable. We could always go to my place, considering I'm an orphan! All right, I'll come. Mothers usually find me pretty likable, you know? Good. - Where are your parents? - They live in Rome. It's my first time with a doctor. I mean, you guys sure know how to use your hands. - I like you a lot. - I like you too. But those murders, love. .. please forget about them. What does it matter now? You know my dissertation revolves around murder. Cristiana, listen to me. You better change your subject, trust me. I don't see why I should. The murders took place in this city. Let me do my work in peace, got it? I must go to an appointment now. - See you later. Bye. - Bye. - Let me show you something. - Yes. The exact same marks. Every gun leaves a mark on the casing. It's just like a fingerprint. You can't find two identical ones. This is one of the bullets that killed the couple in 1974, and this is one recovered yesterday. Then I was right, it's the same killer. The same gun, at least. UNIVERSITY OF FLORENCE - CRIMINOLOGY INSTITUTE The bullet entered here, under the right shoulder blade. Then it destroyed the heart. The girl was hit in the chest. Seven bullets, all on target. Two in the heart, four in the lungs, and one in the liver. Each would have been fatal. He must be an outstanding marksman. He fired basically point blank. A few centimeters from the victims. This guy seems to know the human body very well. I've heard this joke of yours before. Did your cop friends find out anything? That the killer is just one. Like I said, there can't be two identical maniacs. - Ready to go? - Yeah. How do you do? - Hello Cristiana, hello Chiara. - Good morning, Professor. "Our killer is probably an average man living a normal life. Someone of great moral standing, whose skills with blades, or actually scalpels, seem to point our suspects towards someone in the medical field, or perhaps an engraver, a butcher, or a tannery worker." - As you wrote it. - Don't you agree with me? You forgot to include boy scouts. Those lads are good with knives. Seriously though, the killer could be anyone. The victims didn't have enemies. No betrayed husbands nor jealous lovers involved. Our culprit is a homicidal maniac who'll strike again. The rest of your paper is just bad literature. - See you tomorrow, Cristiana. - Bye. - Mom's waiting home for you, Chiara. - Bye. Not here, for god's sake. - He practically destroyed my work. - No, he's just a bit grumpy. You know how my dad is, some student probably drove him mad. Don't worry, everything will be fine. - Thanks. Talk soon, Chiara. - Yeah, bye. Yes, hello? - Hello? - Drop it... Who's speaking? - Hello? - Drop it. Who's speaking? Hello? Why are you so sure the call had something to do with your work on the murders? I don't see what else I could be threatened to drop. Maybe it was a prank, or somebody who got the wrong number. Would you have listened to that threat if you hadn't been working on the murders? I guess you're right. Sorry for bothering you, then. - It would make sense, to be honest. - Excuse me? Dropping your research, I mean. Choose another subject. Leave the investigation to us professionals. Oh I see, you really want me to drop it. Aye aye, commissioner. Excuse me. - Hands off, for god's sake! - Move it! Who's that guy? A pig with two degrees, one who gets off watching couples make out in their cars. A voyeur? Perhaps... No, no way, we're not going out looking for peeping toms. Come on, I can't do that all by myself! I know they hold meetings in this weirdly-named bar. The Devil's Tavern. - Drop it. - Say that again. Drop it! So it was you behind that stupid phone call? Just stop it! DOCTOR FRANCO M. BENINCASA - GYNECOLOGIST My name's Cristiana Marelli, I'm here for the four o'clock appointment. Thank you. The doctor's ready to see you, Mr. Vicini. Are you sure about this Dr. BENINCASA being a voyeur? Yeah, a policeman told me. I thought gynecologists only saw women. DR. BENINCASA - POSTGRADUATE DEGREE IN PSYCHIATRY, UNIV. OF FLORENCE This way, Miss. I think the man who went in is another perv, and he still hasn't come out! Excuse me, is the older gentleman who went in still with the doctor? - He used another door. Follow me, please. - Yes. - Miss Marelli, I presume? - Yes. Have we already met before? No, I don't think so. I... I've found your name in the yellow pages. Oh, I see. Wise choice, then. You can undress, if you please. You can do it in the back, unless you need to use the bathroom first. I... I've come for psychiatric reasons. Ah, I understand. It's odd, seeing the yellow pages only list me under the gynecologists directory. Well, that's my problem, you see. I say a lot of things that turn out to be nothing but lies. - Are you married? - No. I live alone with my mother. I don't have time to waste. Why did you come here? Now I remember where we saw each other. It was at the police station. Correct. I'm writing a criminology dissertation. I'd like to hear your opinion on the couples-murdering maniac. Get out! Out! Your friend left, she wasn't feeling too well. Yeah, I had to go to the pharmacy to get something for my stomach cramps. - Didn't that creep's nurse tell you? - Yeah, she did. - How did the visit go? - Badly. He became suspicious right away. Hey, would you like to come with me to the voyeur bar tonight? Gee, I can't tonight. What about tomorrow? Sure. See you tomorrow, then. Bye. THE DEVIL'S TAVERN - I have a two and five.. . - Sweep. Got some good cards tonight... Eyes on the cards, you chump. - What'd you like to drink? - A coke. You new 'round here? - Who sent you? - BENINCASA. - BENINCASA is driven. - By what? Gee, you're clueless. A driven guy is someone who pays a scout to take him to the juiciest cars. - I'm not talking about Indian scouts, ya know. - Yeah, that I figured. Hey, Birri, this lady was sent by one of your clients! I have no clients. Who's that guy? Why do you care? He's not in the mood anyway. Come back later for this kind of information, doll. My shift ends at one. I know everything about everyone. There's gonna be a general strike tomorrow. I'm free. What do you say? Yeah, good. One of these nights. Why don't you act as my scout, you up for it? Three hundred thousand lire. I only have one hundred thousand. I didn't imagine it'd be so expensive. Deal, but only because you're new and I'm fed up of being the only woman around. Keep quiet. We're here. You guys ready? Almost. Gimme a second. Well? Just a second. Ok. Listen. Let's go. Go on, have a look. Come on, let's go. Off my bike, bitch. Don't come here again or there's gonna be trouble. Oddly enough, it feels like I'm hearing what you told me... You won't believe me, but I've been on the verge of doing this so many times. On the verge of telling you the truth. My relationship with Bob, everything. No! No! Help! I want the money back at once. What's the point of being rich when you're old and ugly? I didn't want to wake you up when I got back. It's almost nine now, aren't you going to university this morning? Oh, crap. I had to meet my psychology teacher. Guess who I saw leaving that voyeur bar? Professor Leonardi himself. Chiara's father. If only that poor girl knew... Guess he was on a research trip just like you. You were both there at the same time, after all. I never thought of it like that. We were probably following the same trail. Do you use your left hand for everything? - Bringing work home, huh? - No, I forgot to throw them away. I had an autopsy on a poisoning victim last night. Bad mushrooms, they said. Turns out it was strychnine. Did you read the news, Cristiana? - What do you think? - About what? Look, two more victims. It says he mutilated her body with a knife. I don't understand why they haven't caught the killer yet. He must have had blood all over him, like a butcher. What's wrong, Cristiana? I must know. I have a terrible feeling. Cristiana? Hello? Who? Ah, right, of course I remember. It'll be my pleasure, doll. Come tonight and I'll spill the beans. - Good. See you tonight, then. - See you tonight. Hey. There's a classic horror on the telly tonight, I can't miss it. Have to go back to the lab real quick first. Set the table while I'm out. By the way, I lost the house keys, can I have yours to make a copy? Sure. Here's the chicken. It only needs to be heated up. I didn't know you were free tonight, I have an appointment later. It's a friend of Professor Leonardi. A big shot psychoanalyst. - He's got a theory on the killer. - On who? The couple-killing maniac. The people call him the monster. The people, right... The monster! Enough already with this dreadful story! Everybody's obsessed about finding out his identity and his motives. And why he killed those girls instead of... But what monster?! This guy is just a deranged maniac, dangerous. Somebody who needs to be locked up as fast as possible. Without all this sordid publicity surrounding him. Only if a candidate fails to get the majority of votes in the first round. Let's now move to the events of the day. Police have been questioning the man for six hours, though they have yet to charge him. This is his picture, his name is Birri. It's him. It's him. It's Birri, the man I saw last night. ...and with other voyeurs... Yes, he knew that girl I met. ...the man is an ambulance driver... - It's him, it's him ! - Him who? Don't you get it, love? He's the murderer we're all looking for! It's the end of this nightmare. I knew the culprit had to be among the customers of that place. I was getting a bit too paranoid, you know. I was starting to suspect everyone. BENINCASA, Leonardi... I even suspected you. But the TV just said this guy hasn't been charged yet. Well, yeah, that's what the TV says. I mean, they must have caught him for a reason, right? I'm meeting that creepy place's bartender tonight, not the psychoanalyst. I'm going later, after the film. Why don't you come with me? The killer's been caught, what's the point now? Come on, I could always use some extra material for my dissertation. And we can go after the movie, after all. - Ok, I'll come with you but I won't go in. - Ok. I must go to the lab now. - I'll be back in half an hour. - Yes. It was three men. Are you able to describe them, Michael? Yes, of course. Of course I can. Tell us what they looked like. You remember their faces, don't you? Yes, naturally. Go on, give us their description. Well, right now I can't... I can't remember. Alex? You better hurry, the film's already started. I'm sorry, but you'll have to resume your questioning later. - As soon as he'll be able to remember. - Who knows when. I'm sure this man will be able to give us a description, though. - What about his eyes? - He'll remain partially blind. - How long will it take? - About two months. We'll resume the courtroom hearing in ten minutes. Your Honor, I... Help! Help me! Help! Help! Help! Help me! Cristiana, open up! We didn't kiss any more. Cristiana, it's Alex! You know what I did? Why didn't you open it? How? Did you forget I gave you the keys? I was so scared I took this before going out... Crap, the film's already started! You'll see, dear, I'll make you forget everything. Half an hour, you said. Don't you worry about the money, I'll take care of it... Some things take a damn long time, you know. Have you ever been here? No. At least, I don't think so. - You really want to go in? - Yes. I want to learn something else about this Birri. Anyone there? Who's there? Hello? Is anyone there? Anyone there? - How's your hand doing? - It's fine. You did a great job, by the way. I don't think the killer is that poor ambulance driver they arrested. Your psychological profile points to a totally different individual, after all. A monster with that modus operandi is someone who feels above common morals. A remorseless individual who deems himself a god, unleashing punishment upon people. He seems to be inspired by certain ancient Mediterranean, pre-Christian sacrificial rituals found in agricultural societies. I also felt a vague, let's say, female signature in the killings. Have you ever considered that the killer may be a woman? A witch, perhaps. Anyway, I did suggest you to change your dissertation subject. There's no way this story will end with that ambulance driver. We'll learn it soon. The real killer, whoever it is, will strike again and again. Each new murder at shorter intervals. Oh, go to the devil... Cristiana, over here! What a bastard! It looked like he wanted to run you over! - Are you okay? - Yeah, it's nothing, I'm fine. - Here. - Thanks. Come on, let's go. We're running late, Antonella's waiting for us. - Here's the bride! - Finally! - So, how do I look? - You look gorgeous! - And you look so white! - Turn around! - You look fabulous! - Thanks! Is Antonella ready? The first duty of a man is to learn how to wait patiently! I know too well about that! Did you guys already have sex? It's the only wait to avoid unpleasant surprises! Yeah, just not in a bed. It was worth it, even if we did it in a car! Alex? Alex? I guess I'm destined to frighten you. I didn't expect to find one of my wannabe patients here. Who were you expecting to find? Doctor Alex, of course. Since I had to come here for work I brought him two boxes of Norzetam. What's that for? It's something used to balance the nervous system. When you're in constant contact with the dead, it's a necessity. Doctor Alex isn't here. He decided to leave since he wasn't feeling too well. I saw his car parked outside. That isn't faring too well either: the battery is dead. - Alex left on foot? - No, he took one of the ambulances. Don't mention it to anyone, please. Two of your esteemed citizens are pressuring me not to take this case... Alex? Yes, Your Honor, those two. I won't stand for that. Alex? I really won't, is that clear? Crystal. The hearing will take place tomorrow morning at nine o'clock sharp. What's the rush? Because it's always been like this. Got any more questions? Alex? Why is everyone so keen on sending that man to prison? He and his family have never been part of this town. - They never integrated. - That's not a crime, as you know. It's up to me to decide. What about our man's two brothers? I object, the question is not pertinent. Besides, there's still much to prove about our defendants. Objection sustained. Alex? Alex, you here? Hello? Hello? Alex, is that you? Who is this? Alex? - You invited your uncle to the wedding? - Yeah, he's a good man. I can already picture the gift he'll give us! Come here. She was so happy... It's just not fair. It's not fair at all. BIRRI RELEASED Leonardi was right, Birri wasn't the killer. You weren't home last night, but the TV was on. I was sick. I had a massive headache. Every time it happens, I have to walk it off. With an ambulance. You're a talented sleuth! Yes, I took the ambulance to go home. Then I went out for a two-hours stroll since I wasn't feeling any better. Satisfied with my alibi? Why are you taking Norzetam? I... Hey, how do you know about that? I stumbled upon Doctor BENINCASA, your creepy friend. You know, the guy who once threatened me with a letter opener. Your obsession has become a little pathological. Do you still think I could be the murderer? You actually believe I could be such a grisly killer? Oh no. Would I sleep with you if I did? Who knows. You. .. do you believe in seances? I don't. Why? Is this your new obsession? Chiara believes in them, you know. She's organized a seance to summon Antonella's spirit, and have her tell us the identity of her killer. Chiara means serious business. The deputy DA will attend it as well. What a load of bull. That poor girl was sitting in a car at night, what could have she seen? Nothing more than the flash of the killer's gun. - Perhaps not even that. - It's possible. Maybe the dead can see what they couldn't when they lived. I'm going. Will you come with me? - When? - Tonight. We were supposed to go to that Hitchcock screening! Talk about obsessions. You're prioritizing a stupid movie over Antonella's death! No! Not her death, but over this ridiculous seance of yours! I don't think it'll be ridiculous at all. I'm still going, no matter what. - You're not coming? - No, I'm not. Antonella... Antonella... Can you hear me? Paolo? Antonella? Antonella? Antonella... Paolo! The girl... The girl! The girl! The girl! He's using a scalpel! He's left-handed! He's using a scalpel with his left hand! Alex... Alex... Did your hear him, attorney? It sounded like a new murder. I also sensed a tent... He's been murdering them right as we speak. He's killed two more victims. Cristiana, where are you going? Did you go to the museum this morning? I did, twenty minutes after the heist. They robbed the main hall. I think the robbers were after something in particular. Looks like a theft for hire. I am sure it was an inside job. Someone who knows the museum perfectly. Who do you think could have done it? I had the same question for you. Got any ideas? No, I'm still in the dark. For now, at least. If they want to sell the items, they'll ask you for an estimate. You better be real careful. Wise words. I've never been a rat, though. They left a dead man in their tracks. A dead man? Nobody told me about that! Well, I'm telling you now. They offed the watchman. All for a few antiques. They'll have a hard time trying to sell those. I can't believe it. The world is going to shit. It really is. I'm glad I was able to leave town while I still could. Excuse me. THE KILLER IS STILL AMONG US. THIS FILM WAS MADE AS A WARNING TO YOUNG PEOPLE, AND WITH THE HOPE IT WILL HELP POLICE CATCHING THESE BRUTAL MURDERERS. ANY SIMILARITY WITH REAL EVENTS OR PERSONS IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL.
