PROJECT SITE What are you doing? Don't hurt me. I'm still a virgin. The project has begun. -Let's go. -Let's go, hurry. Let's go, slow down. Don't! Help me. Help me out a little. -Go. -Why me? -Just go. -You go. You're bigger. So just go. Oh, God. You're such a nuisance. If you do this again, I'll… You see this? He ran away helter-skelter at the sight of us. He ran like there's no tomorrow. Lan, I have to pee! -Pee over there! -It's embarrassing! You don't have to be embarrassed, hurry. -Wahid, a mouse! -Oh no! I'm scared of mice. Help! Ouch, my leg! Ouch. -Azlee? -Azlee? -Azlee? -Azlee? Azlee, are you all right? What's wrong with him? Is he hurt? TEENAGE HEROES TOOK DOWN SERIAL FEMALE RAPIST TEENAGE HEROES OPENED A HAUNTED HOUSE GRANDMA DIED OF SHOCK IN HAUNTED HOUSE Hey, miss! 15 YEARS LATER This haunted house is for the brave only. If you're scared, I'll accompany you next time. HAUNTED HOUSE Wahid, what did you do to the two girls just now? I saw them run like Watson Nyambek. Watson Nyambek? You're just as shocked as them. Of course, once they saw my fangs, they took off in a panic. Why are you here? You're supposed to man the ticket booth. -Well, there's no one around. -No one? That's the problem, Lan. We can only make money on the weekends. Even then, nobody wants to enter our haunted house. -We're doomed! -Hey, come out! Who's that shouting like a Malayan Tarzan? -I should go. -Go. Watch out! I'm going to hit you. Honey, not this ghost. Ladies, want to go in again? Hey, tell the ghost to come here. -What's wrong? -I'm going to break his fingers. Breaking fingers, are we? You think you're that strong? You see this? Hit him, dear. Okay. Have you ever seen a person with a swollen lip? No, Wahid! Help! -Help me, Wahid! -That's the ghost. The one who groped us. Show me your hands! He's Wahid. -Show me your hands! -Here they are. Yes! Hit him, dear. Sir. What's all this fighting. Stop it! -What's wrong? -Who are you? I'm the owner of this funfair. You look Chinese, but not quite. -You look like a Mamak, but not quite. -My father is Chinese. My mother is from Penang. Your employee has been very rude, you know? He took advantage and groped people in the haunted house. Hey, why did you grope him? Not me, he groped these two ladies! Oh, I see, that's okay. Let go of his hands. The next time I hear you do things like this, you're done for! Don't worry. He won't do it again. Take your daughters on any of these rides. Daughters? They are my wives! I can have two more wives if I want to. Honey, let's go home. Apek, it's dark inside. How would I even know I touched someone? No wonder my hands felt something squishy. You're really trying to make me go bankrupt! What? It's not our fault that there are no visitors. If this carries on, I'll go bankrupt, you know? Oh, gosh! Why is Apek suddenly mad at us? Who knows? Are your fingers okay? -Okay. -Where did you grope? I'm sick of working like this. How long do we have to work there? Until the grave is calling our names. Don't be ridiculous. This is a Friday night. What do you want to do then? I want to be a boss, but not like Apek. He's an uneducated boss. What if it hit my eyes? Enough of that. You know how he is. It didn't hit you anyway. Hey, you almost hit my eye! You could've blinded me! Remember, you can't scold your elder brother. It's rude. Enough! Give me that! Give me that! What's wrong with you? Darn you! -Petum! -You're home. Where are you going? He's running away! Petum. It's nothing. It doesn't hurt at all. Sorry. Sorry, Lan. What are you doing? Cut it out. Give it back to him. No! He's going to blind everyone in this house. Everyone's going to get a black eye! You're the one who bought the toy gun! It's gone! Calm down, Azlee. You can't just let him cry like this. The gun is gone. Here's a pen. You can draw anywhere you like. It's up to you. Now, go inside. It's okay. Go play inside. Serves you right! You took away his toy gun, but you gave him a pen. He'll doodle on the whole house. That's magic! This is not magic. This is what we call a magic pen. I bought the pen at a magic shop in town. The ink doesn't leave any trace. And it dries off and vanishes quickly. So, my brother can doodle anywhere he pleases. Petum, I'm sorry. Wahid, I'm going to take my leave. You're leaving already? Petum, thank you for looking after Azlee for me. Goodbye. Come with me. Oh, God. -Mazlan. -Yes, Petum. You haven't returned my feelings. -Please give me some time. -How much longer do you need? You said, if I take care of Azlee, -you'll weigh it up. -Weigh it? I can't even carry you! Are you making fun of me? If that's the case, I don't want to look after Azlee anymore! I don't care! Azlee, this is my workplace. So don't roam around. Listen to me! Don't go around causing trouble. Azlee? Pay attention! This is where I work, not a playground! Understand? Do you understand? They're kissing! No, don't. How are you going to watch him? Me? You have to watch him! No way! He's your brother. Why do I have to watch him? I know he's my brother. But you have to think of the nature of your job and mine. I work inside and I have to run around. You have it easy. -You sell tickets. -Easy? You only have to do one job, while I'm out here manning the tickets, tearing the tickets. Collecting money, counting money, and stealing money. You're so calculating! Calculating? You think this is a bank? What's going on? -What happened? -It's his fault! Wahid! Calm down, Apek. How did this happen? Who are you? Who allowed you in here? Don't worry, Apek. He's my brother. Oh, your brother, is he? I don't care if it's your brother, aunt, or sister! If they want to come in, wait until it opens! Oh, they're here. Lan, who's that? They're selling medicines. Really? Don't fool around. Wow! I know her. You do? How did you know her? She often appears in my dreams. Dream on! Brothers, sisters, ladies, and aunts… Come one, come all! Our funfair tonight has dangdut shows. We have dances and jives. Don't miss out. Come and see Emilia's dangdut concert. We can dance, we can jive. No dance, no jive. Hurry, come one, come all! So much profit! If every day is like this, I'll be able to return to Tongsan. Okay. Where are you going? Sit here! Where are you going? You're such a nuisance! This can't be! Okay, here. Stay here. Don't go anywhere. Yes. A haunted house! Who wants to go in? -I do! -He wants to enter. -I don't want to. I'm scared! -Scared? Chicken! Who asked you to come? Let's go! -I don't want to. -Hey. Four tickets, two for adults and two… Where is he? Two for kids. Two for adults… Two for adults and two for kids. -He doesn't seem right. -Why is he so weird? What's wrong with you? Listen to me! -Two adults and two kids. -Such a pity. Here's the money for four tickets. Here, hold on. Here, hold these. These are for us. -He gives more. Keep it. -Why are there so many? -Honey! -It's okay. Let's go! This is too much. Take it back. -Let's go. -You first. You go first. I'll be right behind you. Go slowly. A ghost! You're scared of that? Come on. -Follow me. -Honey. Why are you touching me? Honey, I'm scared! -What's this? -Why hide behind me? It gave me a shock. Let's go! You scream at the smallest things. You're scared of everything. -Honey, slowly. -What? That scares you? You're not coming with me again! -The kids wanted to come, not me. -Enough, follow me. Such a pain in the neck. Why is the bridge so narrow? How do we cross this? Mother! Oh no, a ghost. That scared me! The bridge is too narrow. -Honey. -What? How do I cross this? -Just cross it! -Hold my purse, please. You wanted to follow, but now you can't even walk. -Honey? -What? -It's a ghost. -Touch its nose. -Seems real. -Such soft cheeks. This is a real ghost. You're good at scaring people. -Dad, I lost my candy. -He ate it. Lost? How did you lose it? Whose cotton candy is that? It's mine, Dad! Oh, so this is what you do? Stealing cotton candies. I'm not a thief. -That's a toyol! -Give me my purse! Ew, his saliva is all over it. Here, take it. -He doesn't want it. Such a snob! -There's saliva on it. You better replace it now! -It's my son's. -Enough talking. Just hit him! -Smack him, no mercy! -Get him another one! -Hit him! -Beat him! Just one hit to knock him out! Calm down, brother. Why the commotion? It's such a trivial matter. Who are you to butt in? I'm Syamsul. This is my card. Syamsul Ghau Ghau? That's the honorary badge from the Sultan of Ghau Ghau Island. Ghau Island? What? We don't need to delve into that. What I'm saying is I want to compensate for your, and your family's losses. -Is this for real? -Not enough? This is a hundred ringgit. Honey, he could be a counterfeit money peddler. Counterfeit money? I cannot accept this insult. You're always insulting people. Enough. Follow me and let's go watch dangdut. Come on. Sir, I'll take it, okay? Sorry, boy. Thank you. You owe me. Why? Why? I didn't ask you to pay him. You owe me in deeds. In return, I want you to work for me. Think about it. Once you've decided, come and meet me. Sir, what job is that? Good morning. You're being released today. TEENAGE HEROES OPEN A HAUNTED HOUSE Oh, God! Lan, remember! Watch him closely this time! Don't be like yesterday! Come here! Sit! Hi! Are you open? Is this haunted house open? -I'm scared. -Okay, look. -I'm scared! -Lucky I'm here. I'm scared, Lan. -Walk slowly. -What is this? I'm scared! No! I'm scared! What's wrong with Mazlan? He let people in too early. What a drag! There are rules upon entering a haunted house. In case there's someone who is weak-spirited. -I'm scared, Lan! -Hold me tightly. That's the first rule in here. I'm scared! I don't want to! That's nothing. There will be scarier things inside. Come on, it's nothing. Don't be scared. Lan, what's that? Slowly. Look at that. -I'm scared! -It's okay, I'm here! I'm scared! I want to go home! I'm scared! -No! -Hey, Lan! Why are you here? Where's Azlee? -Oh, it's him. -Emilia, the show is about to start! -You're good! -Lan! Having fun, are we? Where's Azlee? -You can't blame me, Wahid! -Whose fault is it, then? "Them and their families." BEHOLD! EMILIA'S DANGDUT CONCERT -Where did Azlee go? -I don't know, Lan. If I do… Hey! Why are you two here? -We are… -Going to the concert, Apek. -Who's looking after your haunted house? -The ghosts! Apek, the singer's taking her clothes off! No, she's not. She's not. You two… Where did the two ghouls go? Come on, let's go home. -Let's go somewhere else. -No! -I want to ride it again! -I'm dizzy, let's go. Let's go, I'm tired. Azlee! Come down! No, don't come down! Azlee! Azlee! -You're such a troublemaker! -What did you say? -I asked you to watch him for a while… -Don't fight, it's not nice. Calm down! My dad opened this funfair for people to enjoy themselves! But you, really enjoy treating this funfair as if it's your dad's! Apek, this is about my brother. It has nothing to do with my father. You're talking back to me? Apek, a customer wants a refund. Why? Once they enter this funfair, there will be no refunds. He said his father is the City Council's boss. You three wait here, I'm not done with you! Oh, gosh! What a snob! He only owns a funfair. So cocky! Just wait! When I'm rich, I'm going to buy this place! Then I'll sell it for scraps! Yes! Where's Apek? Oh, it's you, Emilia. Apek went out, he asked us to look after his office. How is Azlee? Is he okay? He's all right, nothing to worry about. What did you say? Apek is out of his mind and tells Azlee to sit outside. -Don't you have a nanny? -Nanny? Look at him! Even if we do, she'd be sulking by now! -Sulking? -It's not like that. Wahid. -Don't make up fancy stories. -Emilia, let's go home. I have to go. You guys take care. Emilia. We'll go here tomorrow. You're going alone. Apek insulted us. And you still want to work here? Be that as it may. My heart belongs here. I'm waiting for my true love. Hi. Boss. You're finally here. Please sit down. Please. Ako! Ask Azizah to bring out that thing we kept. Excuse me. I've been waiting for you. I forgot to ask your name. I'm Wahid and this is my brother. It's all right. Don't mess around! -Don't mess around! -It's okay. It's okay. All right, there? Don't you want to sit here? Either one is fine. Before that, please sign here. Please sign here. -It's nothing, just a guest book. -Tan Sri Daeng? Datuk Mahfiz? Well, Mr. Wahid, I'm an important man. Famous people come here all the time. President Clinton? Wow! Sapok Biki! -Sign at the end. -Really? -You're next. -No need, Mr. Syamsul. -It's all right, just sign. -I said, no need for that. -He's also my guest. -That's okay, I'll sign for him. -It's okay. -It's okay. -Sign, please. -No need. -Sign, please. -No need. -I insist. -There's no need. -It's okay. -There's no need. -It's okay. -There's no need. -It's okay. -There's no need. Sit! It's all right. I'm sorry, Mr. Syamsul. -It's all right. -Don't worry, Mr. Syamsul. It's magic ink. That's all for you. Help yourself. Have you decided? What job are you giving me, Mr. Syamsul? PRIVATE PROPERTY TRESPASSERS WILL BE SHOT Why are you staring? Make a move! You're taking forever. Here. What are you staring at? You can get three of them. What the hell, Tam? You're disturbing me! There are three. Why didn't you eat them up? I don't want to eat, I want a drink. Where's my coffee? Someone wants to get shot at. Get my shotgun. The one with a license or without a license? Without a license. Peace be upon you, Pak Tam. Peace be upon you too. Would you like a drink? No, thank you. We've just had our drinks. I think you know why we're here, don't you, Pak Tam? Of course I do. -Isn't my offer enough? -Of course not. If I were to sell this land, I want a big restaurant and a four-story bungalow in return. With a swimming pool and a home theater for my customers to watch wrestling. That's right! What are you doing? Sit still! Sit still. I'm sorry, sir. Come down! What's your brother doing? Calm down, sit in the back. Watch your brother. Who's that? He's my assistant. Looks like Mr. Bean to me. Pak Tam, can we discuss this a bit more? Discussion time is over. It reeks! What is this? It's ditch water behind my house! Ditch water? Pak Tam, I will not give up. One day, this land will finally be mine! Ouch! -What happened, Dad? -Well, you know him. He thinks he can buy everything. I'm a developer. My job is to develop construction projects. All the lands that I've bought there will be the community's recreational center. All except Pak Tam's land, that small piece of land, is delaying my project. How much did you offer for his land? More than it is worth. Pak Tam is greedy! You heard him yourself. He's asking for too much. I can't believe it, it's not worth that tiny stall of his. He demands too much. So greedy! That's exactly why you have to help me. What can I do, Mr. Syamsul? He's going to spray me with that drain water again. No, thanks! It smells awful! I know, the haunted house was your idea. You managed to scare so many people. I'll give you two thousand ringgit in advance payment. I want to hear people claim that Pak Tam's stall is haunted! When your job is done, I'll give you another three thousand ringgit. Two thousand, three thousand, so, five thousand in total? HAUNTED HOUSE Is he supposed to be a ghost? It's so disgusting. -You're scared, right? -Not at all. What kind of ghost is this? It's not scary at all. Dirty cloth! Whatever! It's not bad. Four ringgit per person. Are you going in or not? No free entrance! Ow! You look familiar. Are we related? BEHOLD! EMILIA'S DANGDUT CONCERT -Where is he? -He's over there getting ready. -Does it work? -Yes, it does. Remember, stick to our plan! What? Stick to our plan! What? Remember, stick to our plan! Oh. Hold this! Go. Someone's coming! What's that sound? Oh no, I have to go. My wife is calling for me. Your wife is in her hometown to give birth. What's wrong with you? Oh, really? That's right. Don't worry. That's just the sound of dogs mating. It's nothing. Here you go. Hamid, did you hear a strange noise? Mouse-deer? Who wants to eat that? He's deaf as a post. No use talking to him. Tam is correct. When can I play? Hey! -Get up! -What happened? What happened? What happened? I think the old man is not scared of your ghost. Impossible! I think he's not… human. That's why he's not scared. Move aside, someone's coming. Let me try again. Hey! Wow! That's a lot of cash! Honey, a ghost! You again? You're still groping people? Help! I'm in heaven. He looks like a ghost, behaves like the devil. Yet he thinks he can go to heaven? -I'm sorry, sir. -Devil! Tell us. How much did Syamsul pay you to do this? -Only five thousand ringgit. -Five thousand? But I took an advance of RM 2,000 only. Where's my wallet? Please return my wallet. My ID is the most important thing. People will think I'm an illegal immigrant. Who would take your wallet? You think we're thieves like you? Are you out of your mind? What's your name, huh? Forget it. You can't hear him anyway. His name is Mat Tengah? -Deaf! -Why is your name so strange? Enough, Dad. He's my patient now. That's enough. Let me treat him first. That's enough. Please leave. -I'm not done yet. -Please leave. -When you're done, bring him out. -Fine. -That boy! -Watch out! -Watch out! -Behave yourself! Don't you dare run away! I'm glad you saved me. -Thank you. -I didn't save you, the police are coming. Why? I'm innocent! Please, Miss Inah. I didn't mean to hurt anyone. It hurts, Miss Inah. Isn't scaring people hurting people too? It was just a playful joke, Miss Inah. Can't we just joke a little? The problem is you're Mr. Syamsul's informer. What's wrong with that? He's a good guy. He's rich. -He's generous, he's patriotic. -Says who? Mr. Syamsul! Says him. To us, he's a criminal! Liar! Manipulator! Oppressor! It's not nice to say that about someone. It's a sin, you know? Did he tell you why he wants to buy my father's land? Yes. He said he wants to build a recreational park for the public. -Isn't that nice? -Recreational park, indeed. Not for the public! He bought land in Batu Enam all the way to the natives' village. To build exclusive clubs, I hear, with discos, hotels, massage parlors, casinos. Stuff like that. He said he was going to build low-cost houses, but we found out his plan in the end. But it was too late. The villagers have all sold their lands except my father. That's not too bad. At least I have a chance to open a haunted house at the club. I don't want to work for you anymore. Why not? I came here just to pick up my brother. Sure, no problem. But you have to return the money I gave you, and then you and your brother can leave! I have an idea. What if we sign an agreement. In the agreement, I agree to pay you back in installments. Let's say, fifty ringgit per month. Okay, one hundred ringgit per month. RM 100 times 20 months, that's two thousand ringgit. 20 months isn't too long. We can also make it 24 months. But that would be usury. You wouldn't want that, would you? It's haram. I want my money back, two thousand ringgit, before three in the evening tomorrow. All right, I'll try. Tomorrow, at three o'clock. But please, call Azlee for me. Azlee. Let's go, we're leaving. Azlee is having fun. He will see you tomorrow. It's you, Wahid! I thought you're that girl. Wahid, where did you go? You didn't come home last night. Where's Azlee? Hey! That woman has been released, you know? I saw her yesterday at the funfair! She's taking her revenge on us! Are you listening to me? She wants to kill us! I know. You're scared, so am I. If we die, who will bury us? Lan, how much money do you have? How much do you have? Why are you breaking my piggy bank? This is not enough, Lan. If you want to leave a will, use your own money! Where do I find the money? If I don't pay him back, I won't be able to see my brother ever again, Lan. What are you talking about? Lan, I know that Azlee is not your real brother. But we've been together for a long time. We're just like blood brothers, Lan. What has happened? How did he trick you? Here, this is all I can give you. Seven hundred ringgit is not enough. We're short by 1300 ringgit. Where can we find that much? If I had jewelry, I might be able to pawn it. How much do you want? -RM 1,500? -Show me your ID. So, is it okay? Here, thank you. -How much is this? -Let me see. -How much do you want? -RM 1,000. One thousand ringgit? No way, this isn't even worth 100 ringgit. -No? Please! -No! This is RM 1,500. There's RM 200 extra. What do I do with the extra RM 200? -It's okay. -I just need RM 1,300. You can use it. Use it to buy meals. It's okay, Petum. There's no need, Petum. Petum? Petum, please don't cry. When I have the money, I'll get your jewelry back. Don't touch me. I know you had a love affair with the dangdut singer at the funfair. It's true! I'm not upset because of that. I'm just sad because of Azlee. How is he doing at the hands of those criminals? Don't worry, Petum, calm down. Calm down. Don't worry, I'm going to save him now! RM 2,000. No more no less. Return my brother to me! No problem. It's just that… the Department of Social Welfare came to my office. They met your brother and took him away. Where did they take him? I don't know, they didn't tell me. Who am I to meddle in the government's affair? Thank you for returning my money. Wahid! What happened? What happened? Where's Azlee? Okay, I'll teach them a lesson! Whatever happens, happens! Wahid, is Syamsul a big or small build? Huh? Big or small, I'm not afraid. But, I think, it's not nice to fight with people. Let's go get a drink. We can talk then. Don't mind people like them. That's enough. -Enough. -Let me go! Let's go! There! How did she find us here? Calm down. We have to find Azlee, okay? MENTAL TREATMENT CENTER TAMAN BAHAGIA Mr. Prono, this is your new patient. Welcome to Taman Bahagia. I am Prono. From now on, I'll look after you. All right, let's go upstairs. Come, don't be shy. Come. Here's your bed, it's nice and clean. Do you like it? Do you like it? You look happy. Come down! Make up this bed, quick! This is not a hotel, I'm the boss here. Don't get cocky! Showing off, are we? Already trying to rebel? Want to get beaten up with this stick? That's more like it. Remember. I'll make you regret ever hearing the name Prono. -What's your name? -What's your name? I'm P. Ramlee. Are you mute? I'm feeling cold. Do you see it? -Hey, don't pluck it! -Okay then. Hey, basket case, get up! Do you want to leave this place? Do you want to leave this place? Hurry! Quick! Hey, basket case, this way! Someone's coming! This way! Bring that over here! Quick! Basket case, here! Quickly! Hurry! He's so crazy! Hey, where are you going? Run! Hey, stop! What's that? Running away, are you? Go ahead, then! Are the four of you running away? Who's the leader? Tell me! Why are you standing up? Sit! Sit! Are you the leader? -Botak, are you the leader? -Forgive me! -Botak, you're the leader? Where to? -No! It's you after all. Where are you going? Sorry, Botak. Don't be upset, Botak. Why are you waiting? Hit him! Hurry! Where are you going? Basket case! Get up, basket case! Tomorrow! Tomorrow? What? Yes! Wahid, Petum brought us some noodles. We haven't eaten since yesterday. Of course we're sad, but we still need to eat. Come on. After you. -Eat up. -Have some noodles. Let's go to the Welfare Department after this and find Azlee, okay? Where do we find him? Wahid, we can't give up. …escaped the Taman Bahagia Mental Treatment Center last night. Our reporter is on-site to give you up-to-date coverage of this news. They have planned this evil act for a long time. The escape method was violent too. I fought tooth and nail, alas, the four of them were wielding dangerous weapons such as machetes, knives, and swords. Meanwhile, I fought bare-handed. I could've been long dead. Isn't that right, Ramadhan? The patients that escaped were Usop Sontoloyo, 30 years old, Puney a/l Putu, 25 years old, Abang Botak Abang Gondol, 28 years old, and a new patient whose name is unknown. -I know! -Tam! -I know! -Over there! -Get my shotgun! My shotgun. -With or without a license? Darn, this kid! Who cares which one? Tam, what are you waiting for? It's your move. Tam, I know you're losing, but is the shotgun necessary? -Behind you? -Tobacco? Halt! Who are you? Not saying anything? Are you deaf? Tam, lay off the deaf. That's sensitive, you know? -He can hear me now? -I'm only temporarily deaf. Pak Tam, I think, he's probably one of Syamsul's henchmen. I know! Look at his uniform, I know it's theirs. Hey, tell me who are you? Or else, I'll shoot you! Why did you shoot him, Tam? When did I shoot? Sir, you can't pass through here. I'm sorry, I wanted to ask for my brother. -What is his name? -My brother… is out there. Thank you, sir! -You're welcome. -Where? I can't tell them that Azlee is my brother. There will be too many questions from the reporters, cops, and everyone else. I don't want us to be interrogated. You're right. So what do we do? Who is he, Dad? -Who knows. He says his name is Azlee. -Azlee? When I asked him where he lived, he said, at the train quarters in Jalan Bangsar. -Train quarters in Jalan Bangsar? -Yes. -That doesn't exist anymore. -I have no idea. That's what he said. And then, he asked, "What day is it today?" I said, "It's Wednesday." Once he heard that, he insisted on going home and going to school. Maybe he's not right in the head. Call the cops, Dad. Don't. He could be right. He lives in a place that doesn't exist anymore, and he's too old to be going to school. Is that right to you? Sister, where's the toilet? Straight ahead and on your right. Sister? Maybe you're the one who isn't right. Why don't you practice some patience? Mother! What's wrong with it? What's wrong with it? Why is it big? Calm down, Mr. Azlee! What's all this? -This is not my face! -What are you talking about? -What happened? -Calm down! -What? -Calm down! Calm down, be patient! Year 1999? This is like the show "Space 1999". No, I don't believe this! Azlee. Why don't you believe that this is the year 1999? Because this is the year 19… The Olympics! Dad, what does he mean by the Olympics? In America! The American Olympics? America, Hollywood! Dad, he's not making any sense! Hold on, give him a chance! What chance? You asked him for the year, he said sports in Hollywood. The Olympics in Hollywood. In Los Angeles? The Olympics in 1984? -1984! Yes! -Yes! Look at him. Such a pity. He lost 15 years of his life. Be patient, Azlee. For the time being, you can stay at my house. Pak Tam, stop! Pull over here! What's wrong Azlee? -Azlee! -Azlee! Azlee, where are you going? Azlee, where are you going? Azlee! HAUNTED HOUSE What are you doing here? I told you, don't ever come here again! Get out! You're neither human nor a ghost. Azlee, what's wrong? I feel like I've been here before. What's with him, Dad? Azlee! Azlee, where did you go? We're all worried about you, you know? Azlee! -Where's Wahid and Mazlan? -Wahid? Mazlan? Wahid! Mazlan! Wahid! I guess they're still looking for Azlee. -Dad, isn't he… -Peace be upon you. And on you. Azlee! -When did you come back? -Must be nice to lose your memories. When did you come back? I'm sorry, sister. I'm sorry, miss. The truth is… -Who are you? -I'm Azlee. Don't lie to me. I know Azlee. Miss… he really is Azlee. He has recovered. You've recovered? Lan, do you think my brother escaped alone or in a group? I don't know. It's not like I'm with him. Another patient who escaped Taman Bahagia Mental Treatment Center has been captured at Taman Melati. Let's go to Taman Melati. It's this way! -It's closer this way! -This way! -There's no traffic jam over here. -Go this way! -It's closer this way! -Go right! Azlee, I'm leaving. Pak Tam will drop me off. Be strong, your memory will come to you sooner or later. Take care, goodbye! Where did they go? Don't worry, they'll be back. Okay, Azlee, I'm taking my leave. Azlee. I see how everyone cares for you, Azlee. Despite you not knowing anything. I believe the people around you are nice people. -Yes, Pak Tam. -I'm leaving. Thank you. Should you need anything, don't hesitate to find me. -Peace be upon you. -And you. I've just cleaned the dishes. This is awkward. I used to take care of you, Azlee. I bathed you, fed you, and I even cleaned you up after your business. It's not proper for us to be alone here. I'll come back tomorrow. I'm going to go. LIDO GUEST HOUSE Wahid, we've searched everywhere. It's not our fault if we can't find him. We'll search for him again tomorrow. Dad, why isn't the door locked? Let go! Dad! Greetings once again. I apologize for having to do this. This is the only way for Pak Tam to think long and hard. Boss? Are you okay, Boss? Does it hurt? It's shortened! Do you know? I am here to find all of you and settle our case. Where's the rest of you? They're out. I was once a baddie, but because of the three of you, I've repented. I came to find you because I wanted to thank all of you. This shirt was knitted by me for all of you when I entered prison. This is yours. Put it on, I'd like to see. My wishes are fulfilled. I'm leaving. I going to explore the whole of Malaysia. After that, I'm going to look for a husband. I want to be a good wife. You all are just like my children. Not fit to be my husband. If you ever get in trouble one day, call me. I'm leaving. LIDO GUEST HOUSE Oh no, where's the dipper? Lan! Go get a dipper from the Nyonya downstairs. -I'm sleeping. -Please help me! How am I to wash up? Next time, check before you dump. Can't you help out for a bit? Why is it so abnormally cold? Watch her, don't let her get away. Peace be upon you. -Petum! -What happened here? It's the La Nina. What can I do? Petum, what did you bring? Nasi lemak. Wahid and Mazlan aren't home yet? No, Petum. They're not back yet. My dad has been asking about the car. Where is Lan? Lan! Where are you? It's drying up! Wahid! Lan! Did you go to make the dipper yourself? It's hot! INAH IS KIDNAPPED. WE'LL CALL TOMORROW. DON'T CALL THE COPS! Are you trying to be a gangster? Calm down, Pak Tam. You could have invited me inside first. Where's Inah? Don't worry, she's safe. Now, let's cut to the chase. Sign this letter, and we'll consider this resolved. Resolved? You think I'm stupid? I want to see my daughter first! Such a stubborn old man! Still want to be the hero in times like these? Dumb thief. You're not the only hero around here. You haven't seen me yet. Pen. Peace be upon you, Pak Tam. Don't run! Get inside, quick! -Ouch. -Stand over there! It's the crazy guy.! Who are they, Pak Tam? Are we playing cops and robbers? You can talk now? You're no longer crazy? Don't you recognize me? Who are they, Pak Tam? The cops are looking for you. Good thing you're here. If anything goes awry, I can blame it on you. What are you waiting for? Sign the documents! What is this, Pak Tam? -Don't come close, I'll rip this up. -Do it! That's an empty agreement. I have more in my office. It seems that I have to sign this because Inah is in danger. -Where is Inah? -They kidnapped her. Enough with the story. Just sign the document. -Don't, Pak Tam. -Hey! Prove that she's safe, or Pak Tam won't sign anything! Who knows, they've probably broken her arms! -You broke my daughter's arms? -I did not! If that's so, they've probably cut her up, Pak Tam! Oh. Did you cut up my daughter? I'm a businessman. Not a black magician who cuts people up! What's the proof that you haven't cut her up? See, you're stuttering! We've just started and he's stuttering! He must really have broken Inah's arms, Pak Tam! You're better off crazy. You're causing so much trouble now that you've recovered. Here, call him! Yes, okay. Your father wants to hear your voice. -Dad, don't sign it! -Okay! Wahid, did you hear that? That's a married couple's quarrel. Don't be nosy, it's their marriage! Hello? -Are you satisfied? -What did you hear, Pak Tam? I don't know, Inah was screaming. Inah was screaming in pain, Pak Tam! Hey, stop being an agitator. I want to see my daughter! Is that so? And then what? Coo and cradle her? I want to see her, otherwise, I won't sign. -Bravo, Pak Tam! -Shut up! Wow, so sophisticated! This car is the best! -How much was it? -Can't you shut up? You're more talkative now that you're sane! Remember, whoever tries anything will be shot immediately! How do I open the window? Why would you want to do that? The thing is, I need to pass wind. I don't believe you. You're trying to trick me, right? It's not a trick. If he really passes wind, we will all suffer in here. Think about it! Why do you have to fart now? You should've farted earlier or last night! We can't control stuff like this. It has a mind of its own. Just hold it in! -Hold it in, Azlee! -He can, but I can't! Oh, my God, the smell! Get in! Wahid, let's go! Lan, you go first. I need to pee. Again? Sir! Can you light me up? Where? Lighter. A cigarette lighter. Oh, that. Sorry, sir, I don't smoke. I heard a woman screaming just now. Who was that? My wife. Oh, it's your wife. On a honeymoon? -Yes! -So you two were playing rough? Yes! Help! -Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too. Please help me! Help? I'm sorry. I don't want to meddle in other people's marriages. You're on your own, Ma'am. This has nothing to do with marriage. I'm single, anyway! Single? Okay, then. What do you need? Help me escape! Escape? Ma'am, this door is locked. Of course it is. Just break it down! Break it down? This is like the movie Desperado. Do you want me to come in too? Hurry! Hurry? Sure thing! Hurry! It's you! -Wahid, quick, help me! -What happened to you? What is this place? -Your daughter is here? -You held her here? -It's a cheap hotel! -Quick. Get out! -Where are you going? Stay! -Can't I come? -Why not? -No. Stop asking questions. You two stay in the car! Get in. What are you doing here? Getting a lighter. Lighter? So who's watching the girl? She watches herself, Boss. Get upstairs, hold him! -Quick! -Don't push! Oh no! Hurry! What's this? Calm down! -Why are you in a rush? -Wahid, help me! -Calm down, you're so feisty. -Hurry! Why is there a hole in the door? -Bitten by a mouse, maybe? -Shut up! It was fine, Boss. Darn it! Open the door! How did she escape? Hey! -Wahid, hurry! -After her! -You, after her! -Okay. Idiot, not through here! There! You're so slow! What are you looking at? Where's my daughter? Here, don't you see this? I can see the blanket, but where is my daughter? She escaped. Understand? Don't lie to me. Don't try to trick me! -In that case, I'm going home! -Hey, see this? Azlee, how long are we going to be held here? Be patient, he'll be done for in just a bit. Done for? Ow! Who is that, Azlee? An old friend. So scary. Don't do that! Sit over there! Or I'll shoot! Don't. If you shoot, I'll die. Then who's going to sign the papers? If you're shot dead, the land will automatically go to your daughter. And then, I'll marry your daughter. Don't dream of it. -You have such an ugly face. -I said, sign it! -No, I don't want to! -Sign it! Why are you biting me? Wahid? Wahid? Oh, my God. Unlawful act! You're so ferocious! -Didn't you repent? -I'll repent again. You think I want to go back to prison? I've had enough of that. He's like my own son, you know? If not for them, I'd still be a baddie. Where are you taking me? -Run away, what else? -Run away? -Are we eloping? -Hurry! Wahid. No! Wahid! Wahid, wake up! Wahid, are you alright? Wahid, wake up! Are you all right? Azlee, your brother, Wahid! My back hurts! Azlee, are you okay? Azlee, are you all right? Wahid, my little brother! Wahid! I've recovered! -What's this? -Calm down, Wahid! She's all right, Wahid! That scared me! You got your light? No, I didn't. Sir, can I ask you something? Have you seen my friend? Bald, wearing a blue jacket. That's your friend? -That's my friend! -No, I haven't. No? Okay, then. -Where are you going? -To my room. Your room? Sir. I don't mean to be nosy. The Prophet will never accept those in a same-sex relationship. I have the gun, I'm going to shoot. -I'm shooting. -Sorry. -Just kidding. -Come. It's very indecent, I'm disgusted! What do I do? You shouldn't do this. You can't force me. Oh, Allah, please forgive me. How could they do this act of sin? Look at them, sir. -Get in! -This is not nice. -Get in. -Don't you feel mercy? Who's this? Where's the girl? If you must know, my daughter is smart. She's probably at the police station by now. -Wait till the cops are here. -What's this? -You look like a mafia. -Shut up! You too, shut up! Sign the papers now! How can I sign them? My daughter is gone! If you don't, you'll die! Wait, I've just replaced this neck. Oh, God! Dad! -Dad! -Inah, are you all right? -I'm fine. Are you okay? -Wake up, Lan! -Wake up, Lan! -I'm okay. What happened? Mother! It's all right, Lan. She's okay. -Okay? -She's okay, Lan! Azlee, Petum. -Where did you find them? -Don't worry. -I'm safe. -Ghau-Ghau! You can't run anymore. We've called the cops. Calm down, everyone. Calm down. -We can discuss this. -So much for that. You only want to discuss things now that you're trapped. -Where's my shotgun. -I don't know. Where is it? Shotgun? Here, take this pistol. Wahid, where did you find them? -You're Mazlan? -Whatever. Acting like you don't know me? Wahid! Azlee? -You can talk? -Mazlan! Azlee, I can't believe it! -He can't believe it? -No! That's right, Azlee is back. No, I don't believe it! -Azlee has recovered. Believe it! -Dad, over there! -Over there! -What is it, now? -What is it? -Over there! I can't believe it. -Move! -Let's go. -Sit over there, quick! -What's this? Quick! -Sit there! -Move aside! -My head! -Sit! I'm sorry. -Sign this, quick! -Calm down. Why are you rushing? It's not the end of the world yet. Of course it's not, but the cops will be here any second. That's good, then. -We can't do anything anyway. -Not funny! Are you signing or not? I'll shoot! Patience. -Calm down. -Sign it, quick! There's no ink. How can there be no ink? Give me your pen! Here! Why did you have to bring a pen? SYAMSUL GHAU GHAU Thank you, Pak Tam. With this signed document, it is now official, your land is now mine. You have one week to vacate my land! Just one week? One week, and you'll be in jail! Why are you butting in? How can I be in jail? This document has been signed by him. There will be no more games. Thank you very much, see you again, and goodbye. Look. My land has become his. You can't even help me. Inah, we don't have anything now. We'll have to live on the streets. Hold on. Did you sign with this pen? -Yes, I used this pen! -This pen, Pak Tam? Pak Tam signed using this pen! Wahid, why are you so happy? We've lost our land, but he's laughing! -Boss, it's the cops. -It's all right. Here! Bring out the gun! -Point at my head, do it! -What are we doing? -Just point it! -What are we doing? Help! They're trying to shoot me! Weapons down and hands in the air! Am I the boss, or is he? Hurry! Quick! Drop your weapons! Datuk. What's happening? Over here! Sir, the three of them are guilty! Look. It's gone. Didn't I tell you so? Look, it's gone! Wahid, calm down! Relax! Wahid, no touching! Did you just pick up my daughter? -Where's my shotgun? -Forgive me, Pak Tam. This is Bada, the cameraman. -You're doing your own makeup, Apek? -Yes. That level was then. This is Apek's level now. Subtitle translation by: Najat H.
