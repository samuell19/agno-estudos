ALTON BROWN HERE IN THE MEXICAN RESTAURANT DOWN THE STREET FROM YOUR HOUSE. YOU KNOW THE ONE, IN THE STRIP MALL, HAS SOMBREROS ON THE WALL OVER THE CASH REGISTER. AND THE TV IN THE BAR IS ALWAYS TUNED TO THE SOCCER CHANNEL. THERE'S A CACTUS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE MENU AND A BUNCH OF NUMBERS ON THE INSIDE. OH, AND HERE'S A SHOCKER, AMERICA, DELICIOUS THOUGH THAT NUMBER 16 COMBO MAY BE, IT'S ABOUT AS AUTHENTICALLY MEXICAN AS THE FRITO BANDITO. THERE IS HOWEVER, ONE SOLID PIECE OF MESOAMERICANA HERE, THE TORTILLA. INDEED, IT COULD BE ARGUED THAT BESIDES BEING A STAPLE FOOD FOR HALF THE PLANET, THIS HUMBLE FLAT BREAD IS ONE OF THE EDIBLE LINCHPINS OF HUMAN HISTORY. DELECTABLE THOUGH THEY ARE, THE AVERAGE GRINGO WOULD NO MORE ATTEMPT TO MAKE TORTILLAS AT HOME, THAN TO TAKE UP FLAMENCO GUITAR. AND THAT'S A SHAME, BECAUSE THE TORTILLA IS A TRULY AMAZING, HA-HA-HA... GET IT? NEVERMIND, THE POINT IS THE TORTILLA IS WAY MORE AMERICAN THAN APPLE PIE. IT'S HEALTHFUL, EASY TO CONCOCT, AND AS VERSATILE AS VICE GRIPS. AND THAT, GENTLE VIEWER, IS MORE THAN ENOUGH TO QUALIFY IT AS... ¶ GOODBYE, ADIOS, MARIACHI GUYS. HEY, GOOD LUCK WITH THOSE MUSIC LESSONS, BYE. ACTUALLY, WHEN I SAID THAT TORTILLAS ARE ONE OF THE EDIBLE LINCHPINS OF HISTORY, WHAT I REALLY SHOULD HAVE SAID, IS THAT THE DOUGH, OR MASA, FROM WHICH THEY ARE MADE, IS A LINCHPIN OF HISTORY. HOW SO? WELL, LET US CONSIDER THE CURIOUS CASE OF CORTEZ. (Alton) ONCE UPON A TIME IN 1519, A CERTAIN SPANISH BUSINESSMAN/ADVENTURER, NAMED HERNANDO CORTEZ, LANDED IN WHAT IS TODAY VERA CRUZ, MEXICO. WHY, BECAUSE HE HAD A SERIOUS HANKERING FOR GOLD, WHICH HE SOON FOUND HEAPS OF IN THE AZTEC CITY STATE OF TENOCHTITLAN, WHICH WAS, AT THE TIME, PROBABLY THE MOST SPLENDID CITY ON EARTH. FIGURING HE WOULD BE A FAR BETTER STEWARD OF ALL THAT WEALTH, CORTEZ, AIDED BY CANONS, HORSES, SMALLPOX, AND A LEGEND THAT MADE HIM OUT TO BE A RETURNING GOD, CAPTURED THE CITY'S RULER, MONTEZUMA, AND SET ABOUT DECIMATING ONE OF THE GREATEST CIVILIZATIONS OUR PLANET HAS EVER HOSTED. HAD CORTEZ STOPPED FOR JUST A MOMENT TO CONSIDER JUST HOW IT WAS THAT SUCH HEATHEN SAVAGES WERE ABLE TO ERECT SUCH A BLING-ENCRUSTED METROPOLIS, HE MIGHT HAVE DISCOVERED A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF GOLD ALTOGETHER... MAIZE . YOU KNOW, THE AVERAGE MESOAMERICAN DIET WAS VERY CORNY INDEED, BUT UNLIKE THE SWEET FIELD CORN THAT WE MODERN NORTH AMERICAN ANGLOS KNOW AND LOVE. THE STUFF THE AZTEC LIVED ON WAS VERY, VERY STARCHY. AND IT CAME WITH A VERY THICK OUTER HULL, OR PERICARP, OKAY? NOW PROBABLY, 10,000 YEARS AGO OR SO BEFORE COLUMBUS SHOWED UP, THESE EARLY AMERICANS... THAT IF THEY SOAKED AND COOKED THE MAIZE IN WATER WITH WOOD ASHES IN IT, THAT THE HULLS WOULD JUST SLIP RIGHT OFF. DO YOU NOTICE HOW I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO THINK "NUTRITIONAL ANTHROPOLOGIST" ANYMORE, SHE SHOWS UP? OKAY, I'LL BITE, WHAT'S WITH THE WOOD ASHES? THEY'RE ALKALINE, OF COURSE. AH, WELL, THAT CERTAINLY EXPLAINS WHY LAST SUMMER WHEN I LEFT ALL THOSE ASHES IN MY GRILL AND IT RAINED A BUNCH, THE BOTTOM OF THE GRILL CORRODED OUT. I REMEMBER THAT. BUT TODAY'S MEXICAN COOKS DON'T USE WOOD ASHES ANYMORE. THEY USE CAL. OH, SHORT FOR CALCIUM HYDROXIDE, A.K.A. SLAKED LIME, USED IN THE CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS TO HELP CONCRETE HARDEN. BUT THE REALLY FASCINATING THING ABOUT IT WAS, THAT THE MESOAMERICANS THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE JUST REMOVING THE PERICARP. BUT WHAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY DOING WAS SETTING IN MOTION THIS MIRACULOUS AND AMAZING PHENOMENON. I SURE HOPE YOU'RE NOT ABOUT TO LAUNCH INTO ONE OF YOUR LONG SOLILOQUIES WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF A VISUAL AID. WELL, CHECK THIS OUT THEN. OKAY. WOW, WHAT A SWEET VISUAL METAPHOR, REPRESENTING THE MANY NUTRIENTS LOCKED AWAY INSIDE A KERNEL OF CORN. I THINK I'LL HAVE A LITTLE PROLINE. HEY, WHAT GIVES, I CAN'T GET ANY OF THEM OUT? NIXTAMALIZATION IS LIKE A CHEMICAL KEY THAT UNLOCKS ALL THE WONDERFUL NUTRIENTS THAT ARE LOCKED INSIDE A KERNEL OF MAIZE. SO WHAT KIND OF NUTRIENTS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE? WELL, FOR ONE THING, AMINO ACIDS LIKE LYSINE AND TRYPTOPHAN. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, VITAMIN B-3, BETTER KNOWN AS NIACIN. NOW IF THE AZTECS HADN'T HAD NIXTAMALIZATION, THEY WOULDN'T HAVE HAD THE ENERGY TO BUILD THAT MAGNIFICENT EMPIRE OF THEIRS. AND ONCE CORTEZ SHOWED UP, HE PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE PAID VERY MUCH ATTENTION TO THEM. HE CERTAINLY HAD NO REASON TO DESTROY THEIR EMPIRE LIKE HE DID. GOT IT. BUT IN A WAY, THEY GOT THEIR REVENGE, BECAUSE WHEN CORTEZ AND THE OTHER CONQUISTADORS, BROUGHT MAIZE BACK TO THE OLD WORLD, THEY DIDN'T TAKE NIXTAMALIZATION. SO THE COUNTRIES AND PEOPLES THAT ADOPTED CORN AS THEIR MAIN GRAIN, SOON SUFFERED FROM A TERRIBLE DISEASE OF MALNUTRITION CALLED, PELLAGRA. WHAT'S PELLAGRA DO? UH, THE THREE DREADED "D's," DIARRHEA, DEMENTIA, AND DEATH. WELL, I GUESS THAT'S MONTEZUMA'S REAL REVENGE. NOW LET'S PRETEND, FOR JUST A MOMENT THAT YOU REALLY WANT TO MAKE TORTILLAS FROM SCRATCH. FIRST, YOU'D HAVE TO MAKE NIXTAMAL FROM SAY, 1 POUND, ABOUT 2 CUPS OF DRY FIELD OR FLINT CORN, WHICH CAN BE FOUND AT HEALTH FOOD STORES, CO-OPS, AND OF COURSE, THAT NEW FANGLED WORLD WIDE WEB INFORMATION SUPER HIGHWAY. ANYWAY FIRST STEP, WASH THE CORN THOROUGHLY IN THE SINK. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SOAK IT, YOU JUST WANT TO KIND OF KNOCK ALL THE DUST OFF. AND MOVE IT TO A STAINLESS STEEL POT, LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD THE CORN PLUS 6 CUPS OF WATER AND 1/2 OUNCE, ABOUT 2 TABLESPOONS OF CALCIUM HYDROXIDE. CANNERS CALL THIS PICKLING LIME. BUILDERS CALL IT SLAKED LIME. MEXICAN COOKS CALL IT CAL, WHICH I THINK IS A FAR, FAR NICER NAME. YOU CAN GET IT ON THE INTERNET QUITE EASILY. YOU'RE GOING TO BRING THIS SLOWLY TO A BOIL. YOU WANT IT TO TAKE ABOUT 30 TO 40 MINUTES. AND IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU USE A STAINLESS STEEL VESSEL AND A STAINLESS STEEL SPOON, BECAUSE THE CAL CAN DISCOLOR METALS, AND IT CAN BLEACH OUT WOOD. SO STEEL, GOT IT? WHEN YOUR CORN HITS A BOIL, COVER THE POT. KILL THE HEAT, OF COURSE, AND STASH THE POT SOME PLACE OUT OF THE WAY, OVERNIGHT. AND DO NOT PUT IT IN THE REFRIGERATOR, BECAUSE COLD WILL SHUT DOWN THE CHEMICAL REACTIONS THAT WE ARE COUNTING ON TAKING PLACE HERE. SEE YOU IN THE MORNING. ¶ AS YOU CAN SEE BY MY NEW SHIRT, THIS IS THE NEXT DAY. AND YOU CAN ALSO SEE THAT OUR LIME SOLUTION HAS DEFINITELY LOOSENED UP THE HULL ON OUR MAIZE. BUT YOU WILL STILL HAVE TO APPLY A LITTLE MECHANICAL ENCOURAGEMENT. I USUALLY RUB THE KERNELS UNDER RUNNING LUKEWARM WATER FOR FIVE TO SIX MINUTES. AFTER THAT, YOU'LL STILL WANT TO REMOVE THE LIME RESIDUAL FLAVOR, SO GIVE IT A SOAK IN CLEAN WATER FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES, CHANGE THE WATER AND SOAK IT FOR ANOTHER TWO. THEN, AND ONLY THEN, MAY YOU CONSIDER THE GRINDING PROCESS. LET'S SEE, BLENDER, NOT FINE ENOUGH. GRAIN MILL, FINE ENOUGH, BUT IT CAN'T HANDLE THE MOISTURE. MEAT GRINDER ATTACHMENT ON THE MIXER CAN HANDLE THE MOISTURE, BUT THEN AGAIN, IT'S NOT FINE ENOUGH. UH, COFFEE GRINDER, BAD IDEA. FOOD PROCESSOR, THERE'S DEFINITELY SOME POTENTIAL THERE. BUT YOU KNOW, ANY REAL SELF-RESPECTING MASA MASTER WOULD BY-PASS SUCH MODERN MARVELS IN FAVOR OF EL METATE Y MANO . THERE IT IS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THIS BEAUTIFUL ENGINE OF MASA DESTRUCTION, CARVED OUT OF TWO BLOCKS OF SOLID LAVA ROCK IS THE FINAL WORD IN CORN GRINDING. DOES IT TAKE A LOT OF BACK-BREAKING LABOR, JUST TO MANUFACTURE ENOUGH DOUGH TO HAVE TORTILLAS FOR A SMALL FAMILY, YES!! BUT THE PURIST IN ME SAYS, "YOU'VE GOTTA DO WHAT YOU'VE GOTTA DO." MEANWHILE, THE KIND OF LAZY AMERICAN MALE IN ME SAYS, "HEY, MAYBE WE SHOULD TRY THE FOOD PROCESSOR AGAIN." SHIFT YOUR NIXTAMAL'S LOCATION TO THE WORK BOWL OF YOUR FOOD PROCESSOR. AND BASICALLY, JUST PULSE UH, 10 TO 15 TIMES FOR STARTERS. THEN JUST SCRAPE DOWN THE BOWL A BIT, JUST TO MIX THINGS UP. AND ADD ABOUT 2 TABLESPOONS OF WATER. AND PROCESS AGAIN, SAY, 8 TO 10 TIMES. NOW WE WILL ADD ANOTHER 2 TABLESPOONS OF WATER. AND TIME FOR A LITTLE BIT OF SALT, ONE TEASPOON OF KOSHER SHOULD DO THE JOB. DO NOT LEAVE THIS OUT, OR YOUR TORTILLAS WILL DEFINITELY TASTE A LITTLE ON THE DEAD SIDE. AND THAT GOES IN. AND PULSE UNTIL THE DOUGH COMES TOGETHER. THERE, JUST CHECK THE DOUGH, JUST GRAB A LITTLE HANDFUL. THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO SEE. SO WE WILL REMOVE THIS TO OUR FAVORITE WORK BOWL. CAREFULLY EXTRACTING THE BLADE, OF COURSE. AND WE'LL KNEAD THAT INTO A WEE BALL. IF YOUR DOUGH DOESN'T WANT TO FORM A NICE LITTLE BALL, JUST KNEAD IN ANOTHER TABLESPOON OR TWO OF WATER AND IT WILL COME AROUND. NOW IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU WRAP THIS IN PLASTIC AND LET IT SIT ON YOUR COUNTER FOR 1/2 HOUR, BEFORE YOU START MAKING TORTILLAS, BECAUSE THE DOUGH HAS GOT TO ABSORB THAT WATER. SO 1/2 HOUR, NO MORE AND NO LESS. THERE, NOW IF THIS STILL SEEMS LIKE TOO MUCH WORK FOR YOU, MOST MEGA-MARTS CARRY DEHYDRATED GROUND MASA, WHICH CAN SIMPLY BE MIXED WITH WATER TO CREATE THE DOUGH THAT WE DESIRE. OF COURSE, DEPENDING UPON WHERE YOU LIVE, YOU MAY HAVE AN EVEN BETTER OPTION. EXCUSE ME. ALTHOUGH TRADITIONALLY CRAFTED CORN TORTILLAS ARE UNDENIABLY DELICIOUS, THEY ARE ALSO VERY PERISHABLE, ERGO, THEY SHIP POORLY. AND THAT'S GOOD, BECAUSE JUST ABOUT EVERY CITY AND LARGE TOWN IN THE UNITED STATES WITH A LATIN AMERICAN COMMUNITY, HAS A TORTILLA PLANT JUST LIKE THIS. NOW BESIDES OFFERING TRULY GREAT TORTILLAS, WHICH I MIGHT ADD, FREEZE FABULOUSLY LEFT IN THE BAG AND THEN DOUBLE-WRAPPED IN ALUMINUM FOIL. MOST FACTORIES ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO SELL YOU ALL THE MAIZE, CAL, NIXTAMAL OR MASA DOUGH THAT YOU NEED, TO MAKE YOUR OWN TORTILLAS AT HOME. NOW I DON'T HAVE SPACE FOR A TORTILLA MASTER 6,000, LIKE THIS AT MY HOUSE. SO I WILL REQUIRE THE SERVICES OF AN ANCIENT MANGLING DEVICE CALLED, A TORTILLADORA. WHERE WILL I BE ABLE TO GET SUCH A DEVICE? WELL, I SHOULD THINK ANY WELL STOCKED DUNGEON SHOULD DO. ¶ HELLO, DUNGEON MASTER. ANYBODY HOME? RUBBER CHICKENS? HELLO, ANYBODY HOME? GREETINGS, MASTER. HOW MAY I SERVE YOUR IMPUDENCE? UH, I NEED A TORTILLA PRESS. AH, WANT TO PUT A LITTLE SQUEEZE ON SOMETHING, EH? TORTILLAS. RIGHT, TORTILLAS, SAY NO MORE, MASTER. LOOK, IF THIS IS GONNA BE SOME BIG HASSLE, I'LL JUST GO TO A KITCHENWARE STORE. THAT'S RICH, COME THIS WAY. GOOD MASTER WISH TO MASHY MASHY SOMETHING UP A LITTLE OLD-SCHOOL. PLEASE. HERE WE HAVE A TRADITIONAL WOODEN PRESS. THE VICTIM, WHATEVER, GOES IN HERE. THEN THIS SLAB COMES DOWN AND THE HANDLE APPLIES THE PRESSURE. WHAT ELSE IS IT GOOD FOR? OTHER THAN ELICITING CONFESSIONS, IT'S JUST GOOD, CLEAN, FUN. HAVE ANYTHING A LITTLE MORE 20th-CENTURY? YES, HERE WE HAVE AN ELECTRIC MODEL. THIS ONE PRESSES AND COOKS AT THE SAME TIME. THE ONLY THING THIS BABY'S MISSING IS SPIKES. THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING. UH, A LITTLE TOO SPECIALIZED. ANYTHING, I DON'T KNOW, 19th-CENTURY? OH YES, HERE WE HAVE A COUPLE OF METAL PRESSES, ONE IN ALUMINUM, THE OTHER ONE IN IRON. THE ALUMINUM ONE IS NICE AND LIGHT. BUT NOT HEAVY ENOUGH TO INFLICT SERIOUS DAMAGE, NOT LIKE OUR IRON FRIEND HERE. WHAT'S WITH THE FUNNY PAINT JOB? OH, MERELY A PROTECTIVE COATING. I MIGHT ALSO POINT OUT, THIS ONE COMES IN A BIGGER MODEL, IF GOOD MASTER WISHES TO MASHY SOMETHING A LITTLE LARGER. LIKE, MAYBE A FLOUR TORTILLA FOR A QUESADILLA. OR A MADAGASCAR COCKROACH. SLAM, GAH!!! I GOTTA GO. OH, VERY WELL, THANKS FOR COMING DOWN. OH YEAH. DROP IN ANYTIME. SURE THING, BUDDY. ¶ WELL, A LITTLE MATH REVEALS THAT 1.5 OUNCES WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE MASS FOR EACH OF THESE TORTILLAS, GIVEN THE SIZE OF OUR PRESS, AND THE SIZE OF OUR BATCH OF DOUGH. SO I'M JUST GONNA USE THE 1-1/2-OUNCE SCOOPER TO APPROXIMATE THAT. AND LAY IT OUT ON MY SCALE. WELL, 1.55, THAT'S CLOSE ENOUGH. JUST ROLL THEM UP, ALMOST LIKE LITTLE WEDDING COOKIES, AND STASH UNDER A NICE, MOIST TOWELETTE. NOW BEFORE WE CAN ACTUALLY GET TO PRESSING, WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THE REST OF OUR TORTILLA STATION IS SET UP AND READY. UH, WE HAVE HERE FOR INSTANCE, THE HOT ZONE. NOW TRADITIONALLY IN MEXICO, THE TORTILLAS ARE COOKED ON A SPECIAL EITHER EARTHENWARE OR THIN, CAST IRON GRIDDLE, CALLED A COMALL, OR COMAL, DEPENDING UPON WHERE YOU ARE. I'M JUST USING A HEAVY-DUTY GRIDDLE THAT I HAVE. THIS ONE'S CAST IRON, WHICH I LIKE. WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT YOU PLACE IT OVER HEAT THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO MAINTAIN ABOUT 400 DEGREES, THAT'S OUR KEY TEMPERATURE. AND THE EASIEST WAY TO FIGURE THAT, OF COURSE, IS ONE OF THESE SNAZZY INFRARED THERMOMETERS. IF YOU DON'T HAVE ONE, JUST REMEMBER, THAT A DROP OF WATER LOOKS LIKE THIS ON A 400-DEGREE GRIDDLE. YOU WANT TO SEE THAT AGAIN? THAT'S IT. UH, NOW WE'VE GOT OUR HOT ZONE. MOVING ON OVER WE HAVE OUR LANDING PAD. BASICALLY A TEA TOWEL THAT WILL KEEP OUR TORTILLAS NICE AND WARM. OF COURSE, I'VE GOT MINE ON TOP OF A HEATING PAD SET ON HIGH. DO THIS, AND PEOPLE WILL CALL YOU A GEEK. PERSONALLY, I'M OKAY WITH THAT. LET'S GET TO PRESSING MATTERS, SHALL WE? OKAY, HERE WE HAVE OUR PRESS, AS SEEN BEFORE. OF COURSE, THIS SURFACE, THAT PAINT, IS STRICTLY FOR PROTECTING THE METAL. IT'S NOT GONNA DO MUCH FOR THE TORTILLAS. SO I'M GONNA LINE THIS WITH SOME PLASTIC. NOW THIS IS JUST A ZIP TOP BAG THAT I'VE CUT THE SIDES OUT OF. AND OF COURSE, THE ZIP PART IS GONE, SO PLACE THAT INSIDE. GRAB ONE OF YOUR DOUGH BALLS AND PLACE THUSLY. NOTICE I'M NOT PUTTING IT DEAD CENTER. I'M PRESSING IT JUST OFF TO THE SIDE, NEAR THE HINGE. LAY OVER THE PLASTIC, KIND OF PRESS IT OUT WITH YOUR HAND. THERE WE GO. AND THEN GENTLY APPLY THE PRESSURE. JUST GIVE IT A SQUEEZE ALL THE WAY DOWN, AS FAR AS IT WILL GO. AND YOU'VE GOT YOURSELF ONE LOVELY TORTILLA. NOW THESE ARE RATHER FRAGILE, SO PEEL THE PLASTIC OFF THAT WAY. AND PUT OVER YOUR HAND AND LAY IT OVER. NOW WE TRANSFER TO THE HEAT. THERE WE GO, WE'LL GO HERE. THERE, NOTHING'S GONNA HAPPEN RIGHT AWAY. BUT IT'S ONLY GONNA COOK ABOUT A MINUTE PER SIDE. A LITTLE JAGGED EXTERIOR THERE IS NOT A BAD THING. IT'S A HOMEMADE TORTILLA, BUT IF YOU HAVE ANY REAL DEEP CRACKS AROUND THE OUTSIDE, IT COULD BE A SIGN THAT YOUR DOUGH IS A LITTLE TOO DRY. YOU MIGHT WANT TO KNEAD IN A LITTLE WATER AND TRY AGAIN AFTER ALLOWING THE DOUGH TO REST FOR A WHILE. YOU KNOW THAT THE TORTILLA IS STARTING TO COOK, WHEN YOU START TO SEE STEAM COME OUT OF IT, AS THE MOISTURE INSIDE THE TORTILLA IS BOILING AWAY. AND THAT'S SOMETHING GOOD, THAT'S NOT SMOKE, THAT'S STEAM. THE GOAL HERE, OF COURSE, IS TO BE ABLE TO COOK TWO TORTILLAS AT ONE TIME, WHILE YOU'RE BUSY PRESSING THE OTHERS, BUT IT WILL TAKE A LITTLE PRACTICE. JUST WORK IN YOUR TONG AND GIVE IT A FLIP. YOU SEE, THERE'S JUST A COUPLE OF BLACKENED AREAS WHERE THE LARGER PIECES OF CORN HAVE SLIGHTLY BURNED, THAT'S OKAY. ¶ ALTHOUGH TRUE TORTILLIACS WILL TESTIFY TO THE FACT THAT A GOOD TORTILLA NEEDS A LITTLE MORE THAN SOME SALT AND PERHAPS SOME BUTTER TO REACH PERFECTION. THE SUCCESS OF THE TACO WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE SHAPE AND THE HAND-FRIENDLY SIZE OF THE TORTILLA, WOULD MAKE IT A PERFECT DELIVERY DEVICE FOR AN INFINITE NUMBER OF GOODS, FROM THE TRADITIONAL SHREDDED MEAT AND BEANS, TO MY FAVORITE, FRIED ANCHOVIES AND MAYONNAISE WITH HOT SAUCE. HEY DEB, WHAT DID YOU BRING? WELL, TORTILLAS ARE PERFECT WRAPPERS FOR THESE CHAPOLINES . CHAPOLINES, WHAT'S THAT PREY TELL? FRIED GRASSHOPPERS WITH CHILI POWDER, AND I BROUGHT A WHOLE BOWL OF THEM, TOO, HAVE SOME. WELL, IT'S OUR LUCKY DAY. YOU KNOW, SINCE FRESH TORTILLAS DON'T HAVE ANY PRESERVATIVES IN THEM, THEY WILL GO STALE RELATIVELY QUICKLY. BUT DON'T DESPAIR. OH NO, YOU GUYS HAVE THEM. STALE TORTILLAS, NO PROBLEM, JUST GRAB YOUR HANDY DANDY SPRITZER (growl) AND GIVE THEM A SPRITZ ON ONE SIDE, A SPRITZ ON THE SECOND SIDE. GIVE THEM A LITTLE RUB AND JUST STACK THEM UP, AND MOVE THEM DOWN TO A 300-DEGREE OVEN FOR JUST A FEW MINUTES UNTIL THEY WARM UP. OF COURSE, THIS HAS ALL BEEN PRETTY NIFTY. BUT THE MOST SERIOUS AND SPECIAL TOP SECRET TORTILLA TRICK OF ALL TIME IS YET TO COME. ¶ SUBMITTED FOR YOUR APPROVAL, ONE POUND OF HOMEMADE TORTILLAS. COST, ABOUT 15 CENTS. NEXT, WE HAVE ABOUT 1 POUND OF STORE-BOUGHT, BUT FRESH, LOCALLY MADE TORTILLAS. COST, ABOUT A BUCK. THEN WE HAVE 1 POUND OF JOE'S RESTAURANT-STYLE TORTILLA CHIPS. PRICE, ABOUT $3.80. WHY THE DISCREPANCY? WELL, IT'S SURE NOT THE CHIPS. AND IT'S PROBABLY NOT THE COST OF THIS BABY-SEAL-CHOKING PLASTIC BAG. GOSH, IT MUST BE THE STUNNING DISPLAY OF MARKETING CRAFTS. I THINK THAT'S A BIG RIP-OFF. AND WHAT'S WORSE IS BY THE TIME THIS GETS TO YOUR HOME... THE CHIPS LOOK LIKE THAT. IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT, I TELL YOU. LUCKILY, THERE'S SOMETHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT. (Alton) START BY CAREFULLY APPROACHING TEN STACKED FRESH TORTILLAS, EITHER HOMEMADE OR STORE-BOUGHT IF YOU WISH. AND CUT THEM INTO QUARTERS, THUSLY. NOW ORDINARILY, FOLKS WOULD JUST FRY THESE. BUT I DON'T SEE WHY WE CAN'T ADD A LITTLE BIT OF FLAVOR. FOR INSTANCE, IF YOU WERE TO MIX 2 TEASPOONS OF KOSHER SALT WITH 1/4 CUP OF FRESHLY SQUEEZED LIME JUICE, AND JUST WHISK THAT UP. WELL, HECK, YOU'D PROBABLY HAVE A SOLUTION THAT WAS VERY, VERY SALTY AND VERY, VERY TART. IF IT TASTES REALLY BAD, THEN IT'S PROBABLY A PERFECT MARINADE FOR THESE CHIPS. JUST TAKE YOUR PIECES OF TORTILLA, DUNK THEM AND LET THEM DRY ON A RACK FOR ABOUT AN HOUR, BEFORE YOU FRY THEM UP IN 365 TO 375-DEGREE OIL. THEY'LL COOK FOR 20 TO 30 SECONDS. TAKE THEM OUT WHEN THEY FLOAT UP ON TOP OF THE OIL, OR WHEN THEY START TO TURN BLACK AROUND THE EDGES. WELL, THERE YOU HAVE IT KIDS, CRISP YET MEATY, DELICIOUS SALTY LIME TORTILLAS CONTAINING NO CHEMICALS, WELL, OTHER THAN SODIUM CHLORIDE. NO PRESERVATIVES, NO ARTIFICIAL ANYTHING, AND THEY ONLY COST, I DON'T KNOW, A CENT AND A HALF TO MAKE. AND NOTE THIS -- THEY HOLD CHUNKY SALSAS AND WEIGHTY GUACAMOLES BETTER THAN STORE-BOUGHT, WHICH NEED NEVER DARKEN YOUR KITCHEN DOOR AGAIN. HEY ALTON, THOSE MARIACHIS, THEY REMEMBERED THEY HAD THIS BAR MITZVAH TO PLAY. THEY DIDN'T GET TO EAT THEIR TACOS. SO ANYWAY, ENJOY, BON APPETITE, AND ADIOS. YEAH, ADIOS, BAR MITZVAH, HUH? WELL, I GUESS IT'S JUST MY LUCKY DAY. HERE'S TO TAKING TORTILLAS INTO YOUR OWN HANDS. NOT ONLY ARE THEY A FASCINATING LINK TO OUR TRUE AMERICAN HERITAGE, THEY'RE DELICIOUS, FUN, FUNCTIONAL, AND GOOD EATS. Captioned by Scripps Networks, Inc.
