[ENGINE SPUTTERING] [♪♪♪] [TIRES SQUEAL] [ENGINE SPUTTERS, STOPS] PILOT: Started sputtering over the mountains. Thought I better put her down. Yeah. Where you heading? Palm Springs, but I didn't wanna take a chance. I'll take a look. [♪♪♪] [WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY] My passenger, he'd like to use the restroom. Where is it? It's in that building over there. [DISPATCHER CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY OVER POLICE RADIO] [GROANING] SHERIFF: Hey! Stop him! [PLANE IGNITION TURNING OVER] Hey, what do you think you're doing? [GROANS] RHONDA: What does it make you feel like? BRITA: Hmm. A cup of coffee. RHONDA: Coffee? Why? BRITA: It makes me think of every café and truck stop in this entire desert valley, heh. Why in the world do you say that? It's all the dots. In every single truck stop and café there's a waitress named Dot. [CHUCKLES] More Dots than in that entire painting, actually. What else does it make you feel? Oh, poor. I've heard of this artist. This painting is worth more than every house I've ever owned or ever will own, the way business is going. How long have you been a private investigator? Just long enough to get in the Palm Springs Yellow Pages. Mm, that's how I chose you, from your ad in the yellow pages. Your ad said you're retired from the Los Angeles Police Department. I expected somebody much-- I jointed the department when I was 21. I pulled the pin-- I mean, I retired. --last June, after 20 years of service. I want you to follow my husband. A woman problem? Yes. Hmm. Well, this is a no-fault divorce state. You don't need a PI. I don't care if my husband has one mistress or 10, but he's preparing to have a child, and I wanna know why. Okay. How do you know? My husband and I have separate checking accounts, and we respect each other's privacy in every way. But the last time that I was here, I noticed a monthly billing statement from the Beverly Hills Fertility Institute. A sperm bank. I had my physician make a call, but all they would say was that the client list is confidential, and that the name Clive Devon is unknown to them. Tell me, um, do you and your husband still have--? He had a cardiac bypass. Arterial insufficiency allows him to produce fluid, but sex... We haven't had sexual contact for five years, at least, not with each other. So you would like me to conduct a surveillance. Find out who, what, when, why, where. Just who and why. Why a child at his age? And I assume that a sperm bank involves a surrogate, otherwise why... store it? Fifty dollars an hour charged against a 1000-dollar retainer is what I charge for surveillance work. When he goes to bed, I go to bed. If he should decide to get up in the middle of the night and visit his little bake oven, I won't know about it. Mrs. Devon, what do you plan to do with the information? Oh, you don't have to worry about that. Well, if you don't tell me, I refuse to take the case. I'd be happy to pay a bonus for the results. [SIGHS] I don't pretend that my husband and I have a close or even a normal relationship. But I have to know. [CAR ENGINE REVVING] [♪♪♪] [BIRD SCREECHES] [♪♪♪] [CLEARS THROAT] [PHONE RINGING] [CUTTER GROANS] Hello? BRITA: Detective Cutter? Who is this? Am I disturbing you? Well, if I gotta get up and puke anyway, who the hell is this? Well, my name's Brita Burrows. I've recently retired from LAPD, and I just opened a PI business here in Palm Springs. And I-- Listen, lady-- [BELCHES, RETCHING] Yes? I'm listening. [RETCHING, VOMITING] Detective Cutter? [COUGHING] [GROANS] [SIGHS] What do you want from me? I could call back in a half an hour. They'll be pulling a sheet over me by then. Look, lady, it ain't easy talking into a tennis shoe. What in the hell do you want from me this time of morning? [SCOFFS] It's 1:00 in the afternoon. I have something I'd like to discuss. Could I come over? Save your gas. Lady, I got a pair of knees that function like Yugoslavia, for which I'm about to get pensioned out of police work. I ain't about to jeopardize that moonlighting for a PI. Oh, I wouldn't jeopardize your pension. Now look, I gotta go. I'm busy housesitting. You'll feel better after you have a drink. [SOFTLY] Oh, hell. What have you got to lose? The Furnace Room in an hour. You'll love the place. It's about as cheerful as Gotham City. Now, can we get off the phone now? This has gone on longer than a Lebanese civil war. [SCOFFS] [LINE CLICKS, THEN DIAL TONE] [GROANS SOFTLY] Oh, God. [SIGHS] [GROANS SOFTLY] [SIREN WAILING] [DISPATCHER CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY OVER POLICE RADIO] Now, he was driving a plumbing truck. He drove right through your reservation here. Somebody must have seen something. He assaulted a deputy sheriff. He put grease on his mouth and in his nose to keep them moist. And he put coins in his mouth. That makes the thirst less bad. You saw him? He knows about the hot sun. He's a man of the desert. Bad night, Lyn? Yeah, Wilfred, bad. Did I leave here with somebody? You're having more blackouts than London in the Blitz. Don't you remember? I got this vague image in my mind of a blond mustache. Ugh! Oh, yes, well, she did have a mustache. Ugly as all three witches in Macbeth. Personally, I'd rather have ants in my truss. Nice hair, though. Rather like Rita Hayworth. Did I ever tell you I almost got a speaking role in Gilda? Are you old enough to remember the Golden Age of movies? No. But my liver is. Maybe my liver remembers. Can I have a glass of your best Chardonnay? And give Mr. Cutter another of whatever he's having. Thought you'd be older. I am. Somebody must have set your odometer back. I imagine we're about the same age. Yeah, well, I just had a check-up, and I got the stool of a much younger man. Lots of Wilfred's clientele are from showbiz. Failed actors mostly, like Wilfred himself. Mmm. Claims he doubled for Ronald Reagan in Hellcats of The Navy. Shall I pour, or would my lady wish to let it breathe a bit? Just pour it, Wilfred. CPR couldn't resuscitate the crap you serve. Tut-tut. Feeling any better now? I'm not quite ready to do eyelid surgery. Look, we only got seven or eight weeks till Easter, and I gotta color eggs this year. Think you'll get to the point by then? I need some confidential help from somebody at the Palm Springs PD, some local talent. Yeah, well, I'm full of talent. I could probably blow smoke rings if I still smoked. Thanks for the drink. Lyn! I just came from your house. Do I know you? You better remember me. Phyllis from last night? You see that lady there? That's my wife. I can't be seen with you. You said you were single. You sang to me. "I Got That Loving Feeling." God, I hate that song. Brita, wait a minute! She seems like she really cares. Well, she pretends like she could care less if I starred in a snuff film or went to Disneyland, but really, she's a great little mother. You got kids? You bastard! You told me you was childless! Four darling little ankle-biters, and they need their daddy. Brita, wait! [SIGHS] [CAR ENGINE STARTS] [SIGHS] Who invited you? Get me out of here, will ya? I'll at least listen to your offer. I know I've been a pain so far. You're a big enough pain to break through ether. I guess you heard I did one job for a lawyer. He was working on the defense of a cop who was being indicted for shooting a 12-year-old kid. Twelve years old? Oh. It was during a nighttime drug raid. Kicked the door down, wrong house. A 12-year-old boy with a toilet plunger in his hand was gonna protect his mom. For a split second, Jack Graves' eyes saw a guy with a gun. Squeezed the trigger once. Didn't mean to. What happened to Jack Graves? Because of my investigation, the DA didn't prosecute. Jack Graves got a stress pension. He lives with bad dreams. Anyway, I don't go around moonlighting for lawyers and PIs. Can you use some extra money? Yeah. A thousand bucks if you get me the results I want. Nobody has to know about it. Well, what would I have to do? Some surveillance. Plus, uh, I need a male helping me on this one because I may need some special undercover work. This job might call for a sperm sample. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Lady, you can't be that lonely. [CHUCKLES] [♪♪♪] [OWL HOOTING] [COYOTE HOWLS IN DISTANCE] [♪♪♪] [GATE MOTOR WHIRRING] [♪♪♪] [ENGINE SPUTTERS, STARTS] [DOG BARKING] You old dog. [SIGHS] [BARKING] [♪♪♪] [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [SIREN CHIRPS] [SNORING] Damn, you scared me. Next time I'll wear a cowbell. So tell me what happened. You can leave out the wet dream. I wasn't asleep. Oh, so you always snore on your stakeouts, huh? So tell me what happened today.[SIGHS] This guy's gonna be harder to trace than the Basque language. How much did you say you were getting paid for this job? I didn't. Your guy's got a friend. Young, cute, long dark hair, probably Latina. They went for a picnic today out in Painted Canyon. She even brought her doggie along. It was very touching. Did they do anything else besides picnic? He didn't spread anything except peanut butter. Mm. He even fed her doggie from his very own sandwich. So where does she live? Know anything about her? No. I couldn't get her license number. Well, why didn't you follow her? Because you said to stay with Devon. I wish I'd followed the guy in the baseball cap. What guy? He picked up some guy out in Painted Canyon. Drove him to downtown Palm Springs after he dropped the girlfriend off. Maybe he just needed a lift. Well, maybe. But I don't like third parties barging into a nice, clean soap opera. And Clive Devon gave something to the guy. I couldn't see what it was. I'm calling Rhonda Devon. We're gonna meet her someplace. Well, I want a drink. All that running around in the desert, I got enough sand in my shoes to toilet train a thousand cats. [CHUCKLES MOCKINGLY] [ENGINE STARTS] I can't imagine it. A young Mexican woman? Maybe Mexican. Why would Clive want to have a baby with a Mexican woman? Why not? I wouldn't mind. I mean, for starters, there's Vikki Carr and Linda Ronstadt. Then there's Millie Valdez, who owns a new car dealership in-- The woman, the dog, none of it means anything to you? I hope I don't get an allergic reaction to her dog's dander. How about the guy in the baseball cap? The husky Latino. Your husband gave something to the guy. My husband would pick up any stray. He's always been like that. He gives handouts to every beggar in the street. He's like a child, really. He's never had to work for anything in his life. He doesn't understand how...vile people can be. And you're still not ready to confront him with it? I'm just asking. I will not question him. He's never questioned me. Never. Have you been married before? Twice. CUTTER: Has he? No. He lived with his mother until well into middle age. He said I was his first... and only love. Now, what if you went to Clive Devon's urologist as a patient who wanted to use a sperm bank? What if he wanted a sample? Well, you give it to him. I ain't giving my polliwogs to no stranger. That's humiliating. Go home. I don't want you to fall asleep on your stakeout tomorrow. Just one little sip of sherry to help me sleep. You know, that's the most insincere smile this town has seen since Tammy Faye Bakker moved out. Oh... WILFRED: The Furnace Room is a hotbed of intrigue. When the temperature rises, this whole joint goes on a rampage. Yeah, sort of like a yeast infection. Stick around. This is one of those nights. Are you Detective Lyn Cutter of Palm Springs PD? My name's Nelson Hareem. Hareem? Sure, I heard of you. You're the one they call Dirty Hareem because you're so enthusiastic about police work. Can I get a beer over here, please? I called Palm Springs PD to get your telephone number, and they said you were out on medical leave. An officer told me everyone knows where to find you after 9:00. Day or night? Huh? Never mind. So, what's up? I'm working on something "unofficially," Detective Cutter. Call me Lyn. I'm younger than I look. Everybody in here is. I took down your license number, along with the number of every car I saw in Painted Canyon today. I already checked out three others. What were you doing down there? What were youdoing down there? You're gonna have to read me my rights before you take that approach, Nelson. Sorry, Lyn. I'm trying to catch a guy who beat up the deputy down at the airport. You must have heard something about it on the news. I think the guy's holed up in one of those canyons. He was last seen going across the desert headed in that direction. I can't believe you'd go to all this trouble because I drove through the canyon. Well, there's more. Some hikers in a RV told me they saw a man and a woman go into the canyon in a Range Rover but came out with a second man. So either they picked you up, or... Or what? Or maybe they picked up him, the fugitive. Nah, couldn't be. What, Lyn? You saw something. Hey, hey, it's not like I found Jimmy Hoffa's pinky ring in Ivana Trump's hair. It's just a coincidence is all. Latino. Medium height, kind of a husky build, bald, big mustache, 35, 40 years old. Carried a flight bag. You saw him, didn't you? Chill out, Nelson. I saw a husky Latino, yeah. He was wearing a blue baseball cap, so I don't know if he was bald. Anyway, what are you doing down there? Well, you know, I wanna make a name for myself. I wanna get transferred up to Palm Springs, where there's lights and there's action. There's shade. Shade? Yeah, it's too hot and barren down in my end of the desert. I mean, my shoeshine melts every afternoon. The leather on my sand brown sweats like it's still alive. I mean, in Palm Springs, you've got trees and tall buildings and spas. And... Shade? Shade. Tell me, Nelson, what color was the flight bag this guy carried? Red. It was red. What are you looking for? You're the detective. Clues? I guess. You know, it's kind of weird hanging around a public phone unless you're from the planet Krypton. One thing I can tell you about this guy is he's probably from Mexico. Really? I ran back here looking for him, and I found these. I was gonna leave them as a tip for Wilfred, just to hear him complain. Lyn, only two of these are Mexican. This coin, this is from Spain. This is a 10-peseta coin. Well, I don't have my jeweler's loupe handy, but I'll take your word for it. You know what this might mean? He's an international smuggler. He came here from Spain, by way of Mexico. Or he got change in a Mexican border saloon. Those guys are always giving you coins from travelers in transit. Look at this! Don't tell me, another clue. There's a page missing with the motel listings A through C. There's liable to be 30 or 40 on the page, if this is even the right guy! Listen, I need the address of your PI that you're working for. And I need to see you tomorrow. Oh, no, that's-- Lyn, you gotta help me on this. Nelson, I'm all through with your fugitive. Otherwise, I'm gonna have to turn over all the information I have to the sheriff's detectives. They're probably gonna wanna question you as to why, when you're supposedly waiting on a medical pension, you're out there moonlighting for a private eye. The guy's a foreigner. Husky, bald, resourceful. Just flew in from a foreign country. Wonder if he's got a big pink birthmark on his forehead? [♪♪♪] CLERK: I think this is your type. Why not take two? One for day, one for night. Will you be paying with a credit card? [SIGHS] Think he'll show up on time? Nelson Hareem is as predictable as a summer heat rash. This fugitive business can't go anywhere. Make him see. He couldn't see with a Hubble space telescope. He's obsessive-compulsive. On another subject, how about 50 bucks? Hmm. Doesn't that mansion of yours have a pantry? Yeah, and I ate everything in it except the cat food, which ain't my brand. How about 20? All right. Against your fee... if you get results. You remind me of my first ex-wife. Dare I ask why? She always used to like to make me sweat before she'd figuratively pump a few slugs into me. Of course, she always used to aim for my fun zone too. [CHUCKLES] [KNOCKS ON DOOR] Hello. Ms. Burrows? I appreciate borrowing Lyn. We've only got 37 hotels and motels to check out. I'll get him back in couple days after we catch the fugitive. Pleased to meet you, Nelson, heh. Lyn, guess what, that Spanish coin? I got a theory. The fugitive, he's from Algeria, maybe Morocco. That's right near Spain, Ms. Burrows. I know. I saw Casablanca. Nelson, I've run more background and credit checks on Clive Devon than they do when they're searching for a new pope. Why would Clive Devon wanna do business with a smuggler? I've got that figured out. The fugitive is a Middle Eastern terrorist. Nelson, there's a drink machine downstairs. I'll buy if you go down and get us a couple of sodas. My left knee is so swollen, you wouldn't know it from Marlon Brando. I'll buy. [DOOR CLOSES] He's adorable. I'd like to take him to the circus or buy him some jellybeans. But if he tells the sheriff that he saw you in Painted Canyon and they interview Clive Devon, my whole investigation is blown. And beat me out of 5000... Why, you little dickens. Here I am, risking my butt and my pension for a measly thousand bucks? [SIGHS] This whole thing is slipping away from me. Deal with Nelson. Don't let him mess up my arrangement with Rhonda Devon. I'll give you an extra $500. CUTTER: Nelson, before you force me to help you search for a terrorist/smuggler/assassin in motels that begin with A, B or C, tell me, why is your fugitive terrorizing in Palm Springs? Well, President Gerald Ford lives here. [SCOFFS] He's not terrorizable. If it wasn't for Watergate, he'd be a retired congressman, beaning people at the Grand Rapids Municipal Golf Course. Look, maybe Mike Hammer could stay on a case till the end, but I've got a business to run. Somebody has got to tail Clive Devon for me. I'm sorry, Ms. Burrows, but mycase is urgent. Ms. Burrows, remember that retired cop I told you about, Jack Graves? The one that shot the kid? He could use a job. Let's go see him. [WIND WHISTLING] [CHUCKLES] Hey, Lyn. Hi, Jack. What a surprise. This is Brita Burrows, a new PI in town, recently retired from LAPD. Hi. Come on in. Want something cool to drink? CUTTER: No, thanks. Have a seat. Brita's got a job for you. Doesn't pay much, but it'll give you something to do. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Uh... I don't know. I... I really have to take care of a few things around here. Ah, come on, Jack. This is a job needs to be done. I can't do it. [CHUCKLES] Okay, Lyn. What'd you do to your hand? Oh... Burned it on the stove. Getting old and clumsy, I guess. [JACK CHUCKLES SOFTLY] You'll be tailing a guy named Clive Devon. [SIGHS] That was a decent thing you did for Jack Graves. Had to get somebody to tail Clive Devon. What do you make of that accident with his hand? Same as you. He also accidentally cut his hand slicing onions. Took about 35 stitches. [EXHALES SHARPLY] [ENGINE STARTS] The guy's carrying a lot of guilt. That man needs psychiatric help. The man needs body armor. He's alone too much. It's not good to be alone all the time in this world. [BIRD SCREECHES] Carlton, it's you. Yeah, it's me. It's me, all right. So, uh, you got me again. It is definitely me. This is Carlton the Confessor. Every cop in town knows Carlton. I done it. I done it. Confess later, Carlton. First, you check anybody in here yesterday or today who's dark, husky, bald, got an accent and a mustache? Be grungy-looking, like he'd been sleeping out with the coyotes all night. Grungy? No, mm-mm. I've checked in six people in the last two days. Four women, two men. The women wore tank tops, very well groomed. Well, I guess we better scratch this one. Who's this? Uh, you, uh, checking out what here? You're checking out... Let's see. You are checking out modeling agencies, money-order services, monuments and memorials, hmm. Burglaries? I done them all, guys. I done them. Carlton used to confess to anything for a ride in a police car and some Toll House cookies. I don't know. Might have been all that sugar wrecked his brain. Did you feel the need to babysit us tonight or are you just in it for the thrills and chills of motel crawling? I'm here to keep you moving and out of the Furnace Room. The sooner you get out of this fugitive hunt, the sooner we make some money, remember? [NEWS ANNOUNCER SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON TV] Looking for a guy that might've checked in yesterday afternoon. Husky, mustache, 40. Probably Latino. Or from the Middle East. Like Kansas? That's the Middle West. He's bald, but he might be wearing a blue baseball cap. Or some other kind of hat. Sound like Vega in 111. He wears a hat. Could be bald. Please, Nelson. This guy's probably just some vacationing snowbird from Walla Walla. Let's not kill him right away. Aren't you two packing a piece? No. Mine's in my purse. My purse is in the car. I have an extra one in my boot. [SCOFFS] When I first became a cop, nobody needed two hands to hold one little gun. VEGA: Yeah, what do you want? We're looking for a friend of ours. You got the wrong room. That's my room. Sir, you got a wasp on your hat. He's got more hair than Willie Nelson! CUTTER: Eh, he's gone. Man, I can spot a nasty wasp faster than the Anti-Defamation League. I think it's time to go home. Yeah, can I help you? Please. I'm looking for a gravestone like the one that was made for a lady who died last September. Did we do it? I think so. I've already been to other two companies who do gravestones. They said you do beautiful custom-made work. What did it look like, marble, granite, what? [SIGHS] I'm not sure. But I can tell you that it had orchids carved on it. One on each side of the woman's name? Single plot, 16-by-28? You did it. The only time I ever got a call for orchids. Please, I must look at the stone with my own eyes to make sure it's exactly like the one I want for my dear aunt. Please, can you tell me the name of the person who ordered the orchid stone? You'll have to ask Martha. I just do the cutting and engraving. I can't remember no names. Have a seat in her office. She should be back in 20 minutes. Thank you. [♪♪♪] What do you think you're doing with my files? I said, what are you doing? You-- Put those invoices back! Do you hear me? Mike! Help! Help! Hey, what are you--? [GRUNTS] [TIRES SCREECH] [BIRDS CHIRPING] Come on. There you go. [BARKING] Hi. [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] CUTTER: What they're doing here? Anybody that'd steal tombstones would steal your swimming pool. Tombstones! [TIRES SCREECHING] CUTTER: Damn it, Nelson! Remember what Carlton said about yellow pages? The M's? It wasn't a motel that the fugitive was looking for. He was looking for memorials and markers. Tombstones! The invoice shows the name of the deceased, what was wanted on the stone, who ordered the job, and the name of the mortuary. I wish I could remember the name on the orchid stone, but I can't. Mike, whenever you do like a beautiful custom job, something you're proud of, don't you take a picture of it? Something to show the other customers? But the boss does. MIKE: Orchids, orchids... There it is! Lugo! That wasa beautiful job. I'll call the cemetery and find out who the funeral director was. [WATER RUNNING] [♪♪♪] [TIRES SCREECH] PRIEST: And many is the time we heard the lovely tenor, Danny O'Doole, leading the choir during his years of happy retirement right here in our parish. Now, Danny came from a place called Ireland, which, as everybody knows, is the best place in the world. And the reason I know that is because I'm from there myself... Would you care to sign the guest book for the O'Doole family? Are you Mr. Lieberman? Oh, no. He's down the hall in his office. PRIEST: Now, I'm going to inflict on you a bit, if you don't mind, a little poem that's called "It Is Free". Mr. Lieberman, it's urgent that we find the next of kin of a Mary Magdalena Lugo, who died last September. Lugo. Let me see. Ah, yes, that would be Mr. John Lugo. Wanted the very best for his darling mother, as I recall. I have his phone number and his address in Palm Springs. That's about all I know. May I? Mm-hm. They call those things coffin nails. Yes. And I've fired every employee who's ever used that line. [WHISTLES] "Coffin nails." That was funny, Nelson. [♪♪♪] Damn, I forgot my glasses. Ah, you've returned. I was telling this gentleman that the police were trying-- [GRUNTS][GROANS] [GROANS] [WOMAN GASPS] [ALL CLAMORING] [BOTH GRUNTING] Get us out of here quick! What happened? Son of a bitch tried to put me in a coffin. Who did? The fugitive, that's who. He's some freak. I feel like somebody Krazy-Glued my sphincter. Now I gotta worry whether Palm Springs PD finds out it was one of their finest rolling around in Dracula's bed tonight. How closely did that mortician see your badge and ID? Like most people, he hardly glanced at it. I mean, for all that guy knows, Lyn could be a Mountie or a Texas Ranger. I think it's time Nelson took his information to the sheriff's department, leaving out a few details, like wrecking a mortuary, et cetera. That guy put me in a brass-handled sedan before my time. We gotta talk to Clive Devon now, figure out what his connection is with the fugitive. We what? That'll blow our deal with his wife. We gotta do it. And we gotta contact John Lugo. So now it's John Lugo instead of Clive Devon, huh? I know I haven't helped out on the Devon case, but it isn't 'cause I'm not trying. You can't welsh on our deal. Oh, don't worry. You'll get paid. Even if it's Jack Graves who comes up with our answer. Come on, let's go. Come on. Come on. Come on. [DOG BARKING] Come on, boy. Yeah. [COUNTRY-WESTERN MUSIC PLAYING] ♪ A frame Without a picture... ♪ Hey. Hey, guys. Clive, how are you? Hey, Clive, if the Health Department ever comes in, be sure and act blind. Tell them Malcolm's your seeing-eye dog. Ha, ha! Your booze would blind anybody, Otis. [LAUGHS] Yes, sir? Could I have a beer, please? Looks like that dog's a mascot around here. Oh, Malcolm? Yeah, old Clive's been bringing him in here ever since he was just a little old puppy. The old gent with him, I think I played golf with him one time, but I can't remember his name. That's Doc Morton. He's the veterinarian around here. Takes care of all the animals. He even took care of my old shoulder one time when I dislocated it. [DOG WHINES] That man sure loves his dog. [CHUCKLES] You never would guess this, but old Clive there is a rich man. Lives up there in Palm Springs in this big old house, they say. He's a pretty good fella too. [CHUCKLES] Beautiful dog. Thanks. You got an empty chair. Can I share your table with you and buy you gentlemen a drink? Sure. Sit down, make yourself comfortable. Jack Graves. Doc Morton. Nice to meet you.You too. Clive. Hi, Clive. Jack Graves. This is Malcolm. Beautiful. [CHUCKLES] So, Nelson, what'd you get for Christmas? From who? From whoever. Well, from my sister, I got a cowboy hat. From my mom and dad, I got one of those do-it-yourself burglar alarm systems for my apartment. Hmm. How much do a good pair of cowboy boots cost, huh? Well, I admire a certain pair of peanut-brittle lizard boots with a red-eyed snake on the side, but I can't afford them. They're 350 bucks. Tell you what. If you promise not to screw up my deal before we crack our case, I'll-- I'll get you those boots. Wait a second, you'll buy me those boots? Yeah. All right! I'll see you guys later. How about a nightcap? Ever been to the top of the tram? [♪♪♪] You date a lot of guys? Oh, just about none. I've been too busy getting my business going. Divorced? Just once. One kid. You're 0-for-2? Yeah. My first wife was a kid, emotionally. But she was a peach compared to number two. My daughter's a freshman at Stanford. Yeah? Pretty expensive, supporting a freshman. They say sophomores cost even more. [CHUCKLES] I always thought I could do a decent job raising a kid. I'm not the judgmental type. Hmm, I had no idea this was so steep. Almost straight up. Oh. This old mountain's two miles high. [SIGHS] The desert sky. CUTTER: Like bushels of diamonds. It's magic. Well, I'm a little lightheaded. I think I'll go to the ladies'. It's the altitude. Oh. What'll you have? Well, it's kind of chilly in here. Think they have Irish coffee? Sure. Bar Scotch and an Irish coffee. Put double shot of Irish whiskey in that coffee, will you? Are you aware it can hit you hard at this elevation? You can only handle about half of what you normally drink. The lady's a bartender by trade, got a big tolerance level. A double shot, please. [SIGHS] [SIGHS] Oh, don't overdo it. Such gallantry will make me flutter my eyelashes, and I'm not wearing them tonight. [GROANS SOFTLY] Oh, thanks, Dot. My name's Bonnie. Oh, not Dot? Dot works days. Oh, that's a relief. What was that all about? A private joke. What, between you and yourself? [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] I'll bet you're glad you're here, otherwise you'd be bored as hell. Bottoms up. Nelson is right about one thing. We've gotta confront Clive Devon and find out if he knows anything about the fugitive. For example, what did Devon give to the guy? Drugs. The fugitive's gotta be involved in drugs. Can you imagine Clive Devon being involved in drug smuggling? No, that's too much for me. I'll take a nice, clean homicide case every time.

Did I tell you about this female sergeant I used to work for? One day the guys taped a porn-movie poster to the top of her patrol car. Helicopters are all doing fly-overs, and she didn't know what to think. [LAUGHS] Macho crap. You know, this is the typical kind of thing that female cops have had to put up with from the beginning of time, that stuff. Yeah, that's what I've been thinking. Bike riding is sure giving you some buffed-up calves. I like buffed-up calves. [CHUCKLES] You like mustaches? I hate mustaches. Half the LAPD has them. Even the women? [LAUGHS] Macho crap. I've been thinking about shaving mine off. How about country music? You like country music? Not especially. Why? Oh, Nelson's got me listening to it. It's all about guys that hang around in bars. Lonely, unhappy guys. Macho guys. Sappy, macho guys. I think it's time to go home. Yes. BRITA [SLURRING]: I feel awful. [CUTTER CHUCKLING] [BRITA CHUCKLES] Yeah. So how do you like my temporary digs? Huh? [CUTTER LAUGHS] Never mind. [CHUCKLES] [BOTH SIGH] [BRITA CHUCKLES] Here. [GASPS, LAUGHS] Hold this. Oh! [SIGHING] My, it's... Mm. Oh! [WATERBED JIGGLES] [SIGHS] [GRUNTS] [GROANS SOFTLY] [SOFT MUSIC PLAYS ON RADIO] [SIGHING] Brita? You want me to help you undress? [SIGHING] This is not my fault. It's that damn freckle.

[BIRDS TRILLING AND INSECTS CHIRPING] [WIND WHISTLING] [♪♪♪] [GRUNTING] [GROANS] You dirty, sneaky, depraved swine! [GRUNTS] [YELPS] I'll kill you! You-- You...rotten sleaze! Hey! [GROANS] [POUNDING ON DOOR] Brita, whatever's bothering you, I'm sure we can talk about it. [HANDLE RATTLING] Ow! Mmm! Brita, you don't have that gun in your purse, do you? [DRAWERS OPENING] Brita, don't force me to call 911. [DOOR OPENS] Look, Brita, I think I understand why you're mad at me. But honest, I was drunk. You are the most vile, evil, horrible human being I have ever known. I ain't that bad. You raped me. What? Date rape. I'm going to sue you, you filthy, perverted creep. You don't know date rape from dandruff. [SCOFFS] The only reason I put you to bed is 'cause you were drunk. Hell, I was drunk too, or I'd have noticed I put you in the wrong bed. How could you do that to another human being? You wanna know what I did? I kissed your freckle, that's all. Then I passed out. You kissed what? Your freckle, right there on the side of your mouth. I've had this urge to kiss that freckle since the first day I laid eyes on you. Oh! God, I hate this bed. I hate this house. It's lonely. I'm lonely. You're lonely. I'm not lonely, you animal. And even if I were, it would not give you the right to... What, to kiss your freckle? You know what? I think I got in two kisses before I crashed. You wanna give me a sobriety test? I couldn't walk a line if you painted it with a push broom. You take a woman's clothes off and you slobber all over her, then you degrade her, and then that's all right, you foul, slithering vermin! [SIGHS] I didn't take your clothes off. [SCOFFS] But you ain't gonna believe me, so why don't you just get your gun and shoot me and get it over with? I think I will, you sniveling, debauched, lowlife bucket of dog vomit. Now, where's that purse? Aah! Where's that damn purse? Uh-- Oh... Oh, you're whiter than grandma's undies. [GROANS] You better get in the bathroom real quick. [GROANING] [SIGHS] I'm making us some coffee, okay? If you say anything about this night, I will sue you. Sue me? Look, Brita, I ain't that weird. My entertainment consists of hanging around with those old coupon clippers at the Furnace Room, so how depraved can I be? We will finish our case, I will honor our deal. And then I want you to never, ever cross my path again. Okay? I didn't do anything so awful. What do you want from a guy before he brings you home? His old handcuff key on a gold chain, or what?

What can I do for you? You John Lugo? No, but this is his home. May I ask your name? Sure. Bino Sierra. Mr. Lugo is playing in a golf tournament this week. Is this about the thing in the mortuary? You know about that, do you? Sergeant Feeney from Palm Springs PD phoned this morning. He wanted to see if Mr. Lugo could shed some light. But Mr. Lugo has no idea why those two guys were looking for him. Isn't he a little nervous, being out on a golf course? [BINO LAUGHS] That's what the sergeant asked. But Mr. Lugo said that he's lived a long life, and that the only thing that he would like is to break 80 on the golf course. John Lugo ain't afraid of nothing. Why do you think somebody's looking for him? I just take care of the property and drive Mr. Lugo wherever he wants to go. Now, we're anxious to be of help any way we can. [CHUCKLES] [LOCK CLICKS] As the old actors in the Furnace Room would say, that smile is about as genuine as an agent's kiss. [PHONE RINGING] [GROANS SOFTLY] Yes? JACK: This is Jack Graves. I think I've got your answer, but I want you and Lyn to satisfy me about the fugitive and Clive Devon. [SIGHS] BRITA: What were you doing in Painted Canyon, Mr. Devon? Just having a picnic with Blanca's daughter, Esther. Blanca's my housekeeper, heh. That's Esther out in the pool. And why did the man need a ride? He said he'd spent the night camping, but his truck broke down. He seemed delighted when I told him I was driving to Palm Springs. He asked me to drop him off in the center of town, and I did. Did the man have an accent? Yes. He was from Mexico. But he spoke beautiful English, more grammatical than most Americans, heh, heh. Yeah. Even Malcolm liked him. And he's a very good judge of character. Malcolm? That's Malcolm out by the pool. [GROWLING PLAYFULLY] The dog. Well, Esther's dog. I'm afraid my wife's terribly allergic to animals of all kinds. [MALCOLM BARKING AND ESTHER LAUGHING] Well, we've taken up enough of your time, Mr. Devon. I'd, uh-- I'd like to offer an opinion. He couldn't have done anything violent, that man. He talked about the desert a lot. Said his grandfather had a home out on the Sonoran Desert. He used to go there as often as he could. Ah, he had a very... gentle way about him. Mr. Devon, you gave something to the man. What was it? Well, he seemed so lost and forlorn, I gave him a peanut butter sandwich. [♪♪♪] [VEHICLE APPROACHING] Just leaving some water for the coyotes. [CAR DOORS CLOSE] What happened to your hand? Never mind me. Tell me about Clive Devon and the fugitive. The guy sold him some bill of goods about his truck breaking down, and Clive Devon gave him a ride, that's all. You agree, Brita? Yeah, Clive Devon's about as sinister as a blueberry muffin. That was my impression after meeting him, but I had to be sure about the fugitive angle. You met Clive Devon? We had supper together at a cowboy joint up in Desert Hot Springs. I even met the doctor who took the sperm sample. You met his doctor? Malcolm's doctor. The sample belongs to the dog? Clive found Malcolm in the desert when he was a puppy five years ago. I don't get it. It's a very simple case. We made it complicated. Malcolm's got an enlarged heart. Clive's determined to replicate Malcolm because he simply cannot accommodate the idea that Malcolm's soon going to leave him forever. Clive Devon is a very lonely man. He wants to replicate a dog? There's no proper sperm bank for animals, so Doc Morton took the sample, froze it, and sent to a real sperm bank in Beverly Hills under the name of Malcolm Devonson with Clive's Social Security number. He's owned this dog for five years, and Rhonda doesn't even know about it. When Rhonda Devon comes to Palm Springs, the maid's daughter takes Malcolm to her home in Indio. Well, I guess I just have to sit Rhonda Devon down and tell her this whole thing is about puppy love. I wish you wouldn't. Well, she's my client. She's paying me. Us. You don't owe me anything, Brita. She wouldn't understand Clive's need. Shewouldn't understand? Hell, I don't even understand. You could tell Rhonda Devon that Clive's urologist botched up the handling of his specimen at his last exam. That his routine biopsy went to the fertility clinic and a sperm sample from someone else went to the lab to be biopsied, and that the billing went to the wrong parties. She'll wanna believe it was all a mix-up. I can't tell a false story to my client and ask her for money. I could lose my license. I could get sued. CUTTER: Then don't take her money. If anybody ever finds out you gave her a false story, the refusal of payment will mitigate the thing. You didn't say whether you were willing to give up your piece of it. Or did I miss that? Yeah, I guess I'm willing. Me and Donald Trump got too many problems as it is. [CHUCKLES] Am I the only one that's crazy around here? Somebody tell me. Unconditional love. If you were about to lose it... wouldn't you get crazy notions? It's gotta be the golf tournament. Something's gonna happen to Lugo. One of us will cover Lugo's house, the other will cover the golf tournament. And remember, we're still not positive, Nelson. Okay. I'll cover the golf tournament. Glen Campbell's playing. If I don't spot the fugitive, at least I can get Glen's autograph. If you spot him, you simply call in the cops, Nelson. You understand? Sure, Lyn. Ah, heck, John Lugo's not paired up with Glen Campbell. Well, who's the pro in their foursome? It's not Arnold Palmer either. It's just some golf guy named Jim. You gonna be able to recognize your fugitive when he's all done up in his golfing togs? I think I'll recognize him. Maybe. You packing a gun? You don't wanna know where. That's why I'm wearing pants that are so baggy in the crotch. Well, listen, be careful of premature discharge. NELSON: Well, according to this sheet, they follow Lee Trevino's foursome. So this must be them. Does it say if Clint Eastwood is playing this year? Yeah. That's gotta be John Lugo. [GRUNTING] Boy, he couldn't break 80 on a pitch and putt. Well, he seems safe enough. I don't imagine any assassin's gonna try to get him at this tournament. I don't like the idea of Lyn being alone if the fugitive tries to get to John Lugo's house. Do you all take some kind of a Masonic secret oath or something? Who? Men. Clive Devon, he's worried about the future because he's-- He's kind of gentle. And Jack Graves, he's worried about Clive Devon 'cause Devon's lonely. Lyn's worried about you, you're worried about Lyn. And nobody in this entire world is worried about me. Well, don't you know why, Brita? [SIGHS] It's because you're such a capable, independent person. Mmm. Now, you take the rest of us. I mean, let's face it, we're more... If you say "vulnerable," I'll rap you in the mouth. Okay. I won't. [SIGHS] All right. So let's start scanning the crowd for a dark, husky, bald guy who's capable and independent, as I am. Instead of arresting him, I ought to marry the guy. I'm hungry. You want a hot dog? [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] MAN 1: Yeah. I'll have two hot dogs and a popcorn. Go in, go in, go in! [ONLOOKERS EXCLAIMING] MAN 2: Quiet, please. [GUN RATTLING] Everyone stand still. [WOMAN GASPS] WOMAN: Excuse me? Hey! MAN 3: Nice shot. Excuse me, mister. I'd like to-- [METALLIC CLUNK] Damn.

This is the guy you've all been looking for. Get off me! I don't need no trouble! Well, now. Pickpockets have been going through the crowd like dysentery. Good job, mister. You're a cop? Twenty-four hours a day. Well, if I know Mr. Hope, he'll say that this pickpocket ended up with a real bad lie. [ALL APPLAUDING] [CROWD LAUGHING, CHEERING] I can't wait for my folks to see my picture with Bob Hope. You realize we haven't the faintest idea what this guy wants with John Lugo? Maybe he'll make his move tonight at the party. I heard Lugo's inviting a couple hundred people. You know, I wouldn't mind going, just to see how rich people party. You can bet Lugo will have plenty of security. I could get us in. Nelson could do his thing, jump on everybody that's bald. Probably come up with jewel thieves and Sean Connery. [CHUCKLES] Um, anybody want another drink? I'm buying. Make it a double. That kid makes me feel my age. When I'm around him, I feel about as up to minute as polyester. I got a birthday coming in a couple of weeks. You'll understand if I don't want to come to the party. I've already attended one of your parties.

And Malcolm's probably in love with some Airedale. Nobody's lucky in love, not in this damn town. Tell Mr. Sierra that Mr. Lugo wants him. How are you? Mariska, good seeing you. Come on in. Lance, how you been? Boy, you're wonderful. Look at these-- It's good to see you, good to see you. [WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY] [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] Food, everybody. Dinner's being served on the patio. Good evening. I didn't know we'd have police officers supplementing our security people. Glad to have you. Good-looking guy. Striking hair. Sure, if you like a tango dancer with hair like a skunk. I like clean-shaven, slim guys. I wonder if there's any pork left? [CHUCKLES] MAN: Ramón... Do you know Mr. Sierra? No. Mr. Lugo's man, white stripe in his hair. Tell him there's a lady in the master bedroom who's had too much to drink. He must come at once. What are you doing? I told Henry I didn't want his men serving drinks in here. I'm sorry, sir, but the lady told me to bring them. She's in there. Hello? Hey! Hey, man. If you cry out, if you try to run, I'll shoot you. Now, sit down. Sit down! You're the guy that wrecked the mortuary. If your address had been on the invoice, I would not have had to go to mortuary, where that policeman almost got me. What policeman? What invoice? Day 13 of September last year. You arranged for 10 kilos of cocaine to be delivered from Mexicali to Los Angeles. You were, how they say, middle man. Your couriers were interrupted by a Mexican police officer. They were able to overpower that policeman. They telephoned you, and you told them what to do. Strangling is a cruel way to die. Two of your couriers were later shot at the border, but one was captured. And before he died, during interrogation, he told all he knew, believe me. The courier told how the telephone voice in Palm Springs said, "I just ordered a tombstone with carved orchids for an old, dead woman. I can order another one for the cop. What is his favorite flower?" I see it meant nothing to you, that little joke. Perhaps cocaine makes a man forget what he says. What do you want? The policeman's name was Javier Rosas. He was a good man. He had four children who played with my children. Now his wife is alone. You are a cop. A Mexican cop. I am honored to serve with Policía del Estado, the state police of Baja. I was a friend and comrade of Javier Rosas. The others have chosen me for this mission. It's a mistake. It's wrong. It was Mr. Lugo. It was John Lugo's voice you heard on the phone. He would not refer to his mother as an old, dead woman! The invoice from the tombstone company said that the stone was ordered by Mr. Sierra for Mr. Lugo. It's a mistake. It's all a mistake! It was all we had, the tombstone and orchids. But in Mexico, we do not expect much. We learn to work with very little in so many ways. Arrest me then. Arrest me! I can prove nothing in your courts. I have no wish to torment you, Mr. Sierra. But I had to be sure about you. And now, I am. I can get lots of money. More money than you've ever seen in-- [GROANS] [KNIFE SLICES FLESH] [♪♪♪] [GASPING] [SCREAMS] [PEOPLE MURMURING, EXCLAIMING] WOMAN: Oh, my lord! MAN: Oh, my God. [ALL CLAMORING] [♪♪♪] No. [GRUNTS] Hey! [TIRES SCREECHING] [SIGHS] I'll never know, that's the hell of it. I'll never know. What else could it be but a drug deal gone sour? Bino Sierra burned somebody, and he's getting paid back. Why? [SIGHS] Well, it has all the earmarks of a drug payback. That's not what I mean. I mean, why didn't this guy shoot me? Why didn't he cut my throat? Why? You think I'll look good in a Palm Springs uniform? [DISPATCHER CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY OVER POLICE RADIO] Well, my knees need a drink. You wanna join me? Thought maybe we could celebrate the end of our, uh, partnership. I enjoyed myself, most of the time. [CHUCKLES] Aren't you ever gonna forget about the other night? It's forgotten. [♪♪♪] I've been thinking, maybe after I get my retirement, I could help you with a case once in a while. I'm a pretty good detective, right? Yes, you are. But I don't think that would be a good idea. Am I that hard to take? Actually, you're smart. And funny. And you're pretty nice to be with, sometimes. You know, this is none of my business, but you don't have to end up a Furnace Room drunk... or like Jack Graves. So is this it? [CLEARS THROAT] Are we finished? [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] As a team, I mean? I never did tell you. You've got pretty nice buns.

I have to get rid of this razor blade they call a seat, though. It's a really nice bike. Keep your Scotch in that bottle? I haven't had a drink in 29 days, 18 hours and 15 minutes. Hmm. Thought you were gonna shave your mustache off. I did shave it off. Then I remembered why I grew it in the first place, so I grew it back again. [CHUCKLES] Macho crap. That's it. So, what's it feel like, quitting drinking? Ah, it's easy. Gotta find a lot of substitute activities to occupy your mind. Me, I've been eating a lot of live lizards. Got any live lizards under your house? Wanna go for a bike ride? I don't think so. I already rode this morning. At your age, you can't work out in the morning and in the afternoon.
