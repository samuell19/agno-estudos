Move! Thank you, gentlemen. Gently, if you please. Hmm. Hmm. Mary! Shouldn't you be out? We could do with more shells. Them little ammonites, tourist tut. And driftwood. Before I catch my death. What are you doing? Yes. No, please, don't let me disturb you. - I am very content to watch you work. - The shop's closed, sir. It's wonderful, isn't it? Cornu ammonis? Ammonite. It's a broken one. It's still a fine specimen. Is there something you wanted, sir? Sorry. Please, let me introduce myself, Miss Anning. Roderick Murchison. I must confess I'm a little in awe. Your reputation is something I've often heard discussed in the Geographical Society in London. - All boys together. - Yes, well... Quite. But your insights, your skills, are legendary and I thought for my archaeological tour of the Continent, how could I miss the opportunity to meet you? And here you are. At your work. I was under the impression that fine London gentlemen were no longer interested in my sea creature relics. Fashion moved on, did it not? Quite. I'm afraid I'm a bit of a late starter. And how could I not want to meet "the presiding deity of Lyme"? It'd be customary for a gentleman to write to me to make an appointment before arriving unannounced. - Yes, unforgivable. - Could you not fiddle with that? Sorry. May I introduce my wife, Mrs. Charlotte Murchison? Sir, as you can see, I don't excavate larger pieces any more. I've seen that particular relic in the British Museum. A complete ichthyosaurus. Am I correct? And that's one of yours? It's fascinating. I would love to purchase this ammonite from you, but I must be honest. What I would dearly appreciate is the opportunity to spend some time working with you on the shore, seeing what you see. I don't conduct guided tours any more. I'm not a tourist, Miss Anning, I'm a scientist, like you. A man of the new world and I'm here to learn all I can from you. And, of course, I am more than happy to recompense you for your time. And, obviously, as it's an inconvenience to yourself, I would be able to pay a premium for a private audience. As well as the purchase of this fine ammonite, of course. It's not easy work. - Good. - I can't promise we'll find anything. Naturally. - Very well. - Splendid! You've no idea what this means to me. My friends will be most envious. - Do you have a quieter dining room? - Yes, sir, but... This music's a little overwhelming for the situation. - Couldn't we... - Don't make a fuss. - What is the soup? - Hare. I'll have the oysters. Are they larded? A la mode, sir. Perfect. And the beef. Rare. - Very good, sir. - Braised celery, boiled potatoes. Pouring cream for the potatoes. Would you bring your wine list? No, wait. Just bring me a bottle of the claret. We have the '26 or '35. The '35. And my wife will have some plain white fish. Baked. No sauce. It's not the right time to make another baby. Miss Anning. Miss Anning. Sorry. Am I late? - The old woman in your shop... - My mother. Of course. I do beg your pardon. Your mother said I would find you here. It was a bright morning, and the tide was out. I couldn't wait. Yes, of course. I just didn't want to miss anything. Well, you're here now. Yes. Nothing. Beef. Limestone. - Calcite crystal. - And this? Look here. There is a little ammonite inside, but that dimple tells me it will be crushed. You could chip it out, but it won't be any good. Oh, that's nice. Coprolite. Very nice. I'm not familiar with this type. If you look very carefully, you can see tiny fish bones. Those little black flecks... they're scales. That'll polish up very nice. Thank you. - But what is it? - Fossilized feces. - Pardon? - Yes, Mr. Murchison. Shit. The tide will be coming in soon. We ought to be getting back. Charlotte, look what I found with Miss Anning. Charlotte. - What are you doing? - Taking you out of this stinking room. - I don't want to. - I'm afraid that's no longer a choice. We can't continue like this, Charlotte. You're like a shadow. It simply won't do. It's madness for me to expect you to be well enough to accompany me abroad. - It seems you need more time for your convalescence. - Roddy... Lyme appears to be the perfect place for you. This expedition is extensive. You were prescribed rest. - Sea bathing. - I don't like the water. Little stimulation. I want my bright, funny, clever wife back. I don't want to be alone. Is there something else? My wife, Charlotte, she hasn't been at all well of late. She suffers... Well, it's mild melancholia, perhaps. The doctor prescribed taking the sea air, but it has been a little slow. I have arranged for her to stay on in Lyme, and although I'm reassured that she will be well cared for, she would be alone. I was thinking... hoping, really, what a wonderful opportunity it would be for her to walk out with you. - Walk out? - Yes. Walk the shoreline with you. - Learn from you. - I'm not looking for an apprentice. - No, of course not. - I am in no position to spend my days caring for an invalid. No, and... it wouldn't require you to. You showed me such courtesy yesterday, sharing your knowledge, and I was hoping that you might be able to afford my wife the same generosity. You'll help give her an interest, as it were. And it would only be for... four weeks. Perhaps five. But no more than six. Excuse me, Mrs. Murchison, but Mr. Murchison instructed me to help you dress for your day out today. I'm not going. I'm very sorry, Mrs. Murchison, but Mr. Murchison was most insistent I get you up out of bed and dressed immediately. Please don't throw anything else at me, miss. What is it? Something. Nothing. Shouldn't you excavate it? I mean, isn't that what you do? My husband said that's what you're meant to show me. Let me be clear. I don't want you here. Your husband paid me to take you out with me. Doesn't matter to me if you wanna be here or not. But please don't question or presume to tell me how I conduct my business. I came to get help with my illness. To bathe and to walk. - Not work like a navvy. - Bathe? Then may I suggest you rid me of your bad company and go get better bathing. - My husband... - Your husband left you. There looks to be fuck all wrong with you to me. That'll do, boy! Mother! Mother! Fuck! Mother! You're new. Yes. Foreign? Uh... yes. There appears to be a high fever. Did she take a chill yesterday? - Get wet in the rain, perhaps? - I don't know. Maybe she went bathing. Oh, yes, water torture. She'll need care. - Night and day. - I'm not a nurse, Doctor. I barely know the woman. Hmm. Um... Yes. Miss Anning, it is a woman's position to care for a fellow sister, is it not? Make sure you keep her warm, but not too hot. And cold compresses should help relieve the fever. I'll write to her husband and send for her things. And please do call for me if her condition changes. I'll bid you a good afternoon. How long is she intending on being in residence? You should send her home... to that London. It's not our responsibility. She might die, Mother. How are we to survive while you play lady's maid? We'll manage. If she is to be accommodated in my home, with constant care, and you turfed out of your bed, that husband of hers needs to pay more! No. No. I didn't... I didn't see her... in the ground. It was cold. Cold. Mary. Hello. I need to purchase a jar of salve, please. Salve? It's not your ma again? Poor Molly. Is she worse? Do you want to come in? Just the salve. You look well. I like your hair longer. It suits you. I haven't seen you in church for some time. Well, I've had my work. Mary, work on Sunday? Will God forgive you? You know you can always ask me for help. I don't think that'd be such a good idea. I came for the salve, not a sermon. I understand. Keep your coins. They're hard earned. Mary... You sure you don't want to come in? Lightning Mary. Plus ça change. Hmm. Sorry. All very good. Miss Anning, I must commend you. I did not expect to see Mrs. Murchison looking quite as radiant as she does. Really. Wonderful work. Good. Excellent. A good pot of strong broth. Keep using the salve, gentle exercise and sea air. Try not to excite yourself, Mrs. Murchison. Good. Good. I will call again. Thank you, Miss Anning. You're up. I was thinking perhaps we might go out onto the beach this morning. Just take the air. If you think I'm strong enough. Do you think you're strong enough? I do, I think. Good. Can I help? You could scrape these. Maybe you could get some coal. Outside. That looks difficult. Dull. Cheap tourist fodder. Can I try? Use this... to stick them down. This. You look tired. I always look tired. You look after me like your child. You don't have any? What a lot of questions. I might have preferred it when you were unconscious. No. No children. I'm sorry. For what? My mother had ten. I remember six of them dying. And two before me. Eight babies dead. Each one taking something of her when they went. I have my work. I didn't need children as well. You can't keep sleeping in that chair. You need your rest. I've taken your bed for too long. Did you want to go back to the hotel? No. Unless you want me to. No. We should share the bed. What are you doing? - I wanted to help. - They're mine. My babies. Something wrong? Um... Dr. Lieberson has come to see you. Oh, no. Sorry. More a social visit. My mission was to give this to you, Miss Anning. It's an invitation. A musical evening. I thought after all your work with Mrs. Murchison, you might like a little treat. What about Mrs. Murchison? Pardon? I'm not sure I understand. Well, Mrs. Murchison appreciates music much more than I do. Where's her invitation? I would naturally be accompanied by Mrs. Murchison in her own right. - Do you not think? - Yes. I just thought given Mrs. Murchison's condition, this might prove a little... overstimulating. Rubbish. As her doctor, I would strongly advise against it. And as her friend, I disagree. Dr. Lieberson, I will happily attend your recital. But with Mrs. Murchison. So be it. Excellent. I will see you both this evening, then. Mary! Absolutely... Excuse me. Miss Anning. So sorry for neglecting you. Let me introduce you to some people. I just need to... Where's the... Oh, of course. It's right through the back. After you. Ladies, gentlemen, new friends. Please do take your seats as we are about to begin. Do sit here. This is marvelous. You left me. What are you writing? May I see? Please, don't be silly. Let me see. Please. "Is it that I am all alone? Yet in my dreams, a form I view That thinks on me and loves me, too. I start, and when the vision's flown, I weep and I am all alone." You were the most fascinating person there tonight. And I think the most beautiful. Mary, look what's fallen down. It's the rock thing. It's too big. Impossible to move. You're wasting your time. What is it? See here? This is a row of small vertebrae. And these flatter sides are where the ribs would have been attached. But these ones have a certain shape, which tells me they would have been near the skull. And that's good? It would be very good, yes. That one was special. I was only 11 years old. Days it took to dig it out, clean it. I'd like to see it. It's in The British Museum with its fancy made-up name. Ichthyosaurus. We couldn't keep it. It was a year's worth of food, rent and clothing. That's such a poor drawing. A child's hand. I like it. I'm pleased my rock was worth the work. You found the head. Beautiful. We can go tomorrow to find the rest of it. Perhaps. I should help. - Go to bed. - Won't that wait till the morning? Father would turn in his grave if he thought I'd gone to bed without cleaning his tools. Good night. Good morning. - Say it again. - Hmm. Please. There was a young woman named Sally Who loved the occasional dally She sat on the lap Of a well-endowed chap And she said, "Ooh, you're right up my alley." It was something like a sea lizard with fins. - It was probably six feet long. - Goodness. It's one of the best I've found in a long time. It will require some thought. £22? What price would you suggest then, sir? I'm not in the market for haggling. It's a stunning example, isn't it? In my humble opinion, the physical effort Miss Anning goes through to procure such a specimen would make the price tag seem quite reasonable. Then there is the painstaking hours spent working on the specimen to reveal it in all its beauty. - Charlotte... - On top of this sheer hard work, let us not forget the knowledge and years of skill Miss Anning brings to her tasks. Without this, and to the untrained or ill-formed eye, these would simply be un-investigated lumps of stone and rock. Why do you think the scientific community places such importance on this work? Miss Anning informs us not only of our past, but of our present. With all this in mind, how would you put a price on this, sir? I see. Sit down, Mrs. Anning. It's mushrooms for supper. Fancy. Sit down. There's plenty. The shop won't run itself. Close it, then. Oh, I almost forgot. Correspondence came for you, Mrs. Murchison. Thank you. Shh. It's warm. Last year at this time we had snow, and now it's nice. I had to start the babies on my own. I think I might go to my bed. What are you doing? Pricing up this thing. We're closed. It's me, Mary. Can I come in? I'm so sorry, Mary. Molly was... a perspicacious woman. Her strength to carry on after your father died was admirable. Tell me, have you been in correspondence with your Mrs. Murchison recently? She's clever. And funny. I very much enjoyed her company. It pleases me you've struck up a friendship together. I know I hurt you terribly, and I'm deeply sorry for that. I just wasn't sure I could live up to you. Or your expectations of me. A small side step could curtail it completely. I wasn't the enemy, but it often felt like I was. I tried. No. I don't think you did. Not really. You seemed to do everything you could to be distant. Eventually, I just... stopped trying. It seems your Mrs. Murchison has been able to... unlock something in you that I couldn't. Tradesmen's entrance is around the side. Go all the way back. I'm here as a guest of Mrs. Charlotte Murchison. Miss Anning? Yes. I beg your pardon, miss. Please, do come this way. Please wait here, miss. Thank you. That's just the maid. Thank you, Anne. That will be all. Oh, Mary! My Mary! I can't believe you're here. How was the journey? I wish you would have let me send a carriage. It feels a very long way from Lyme. Oh. I had it all planned out. We'd have tea, and then I'd show you, but I just don't think I can wait any longer. Come on! Close your eyes. You must close your eyes or it will ruin everything. I don't think I like surprises. You can open them. It's yours. - Mine? - Yes. To stay the night? Well, yes, but no. Also yours to move into. To live here with me. Here, I thought you could put your mother's figurines. And here you can write your journal. Such a good light, isn't it? - But I have my home. - And in here... They're for you. I had them made just for you. Feel this one. Oh, and one last thing. My room. So we'll be next to each other, always. - You've thought of everything. - I hope so. I didn't want you to worry about anything. Well, say something. - Sorry. I really shouldn't... - Mary. I wanted to see my relic in the British Museum today, so I should... We'll see it later once we've settled you in. I feel... I feel I'm at a great disadvantage. Pardon? I feel I've been misled. - I don't think I have... - I was invited for a visit. And now it seems I've been hoodwinked in some way. Mary... Why did you not mention all this in your letter? I wanted to see the look on your face. You presumed I'd be fitted into your life, here, like one of my relics in your fine glass case. - No, of course not. - Will you label me, too? No, that's not what I want. That's not what I intended. I want this to be different. Our different. This must make your husband very happy. - Who cares? - Oh, please don't make fun of me. Roddy is content with his life. Very content. And because of you, he now has a proper interest that takes up most of his time. You make it sound so neat, like I planned it. Of course not. Please, why are you doing this? I don't want to go back to the life I had before you. What about my life, Charlotte? My work? I can't bear to think of you suffering out on those beaches in all weathers. And now you'll be free to do your important work, your scientific work. You don't understand me. No! Your proposition makes me feel like some fancy bird in a gilded cage. I need to find lodgings for tonight. I wish you'd told me before. I could have saved the boat fare. Mary... Mary!
