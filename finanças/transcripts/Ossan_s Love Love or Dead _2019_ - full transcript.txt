The one I love always has their eyes on someone else. Could I have one of those, please? One! That'll be 6 dollars! Bye bye! Thank you! So yummy! After working in Shanghai, I was sent to Hong Kong for another 6 months. After completing another big apartment development project, I was to return to Tokyo once more. Excuse me, sir!. You're looking at an amazing item here. Very beautiful! It's real! And it's cheap too! Get a good look. It symbolizes "Forever Love". "Forever Love"? Why don't you buy it? Thank you, sir! Thank you! Wait wait wait! WAIT! WAIT! Wait wait wait wait! Excuse me! Sorry, excuse me. Bring it on!!! No no no! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Thank you! Forever looove! Ohhh! Is it okay? Thank you! Be careful, okay? Bye bye! You dropped your keychain! Ohhhh!! That was a close one!! It was only for a short time, but I enjoyed working with you all! Haruta, good luck back in Japan! I had a big finish with my comrades, who I'd been through the good and bad with. Maybe TOO much of a big finish... Before I knew it, it was morning. Hey, wake up. Wake up! Ni hao! Maki... Maki? Why? MAAAAAKIIII!! Maki! Makimakimakimakimaki! What is that about? No! It's not what you think! It's not what you're thinking at all! It's not what it looks like! But Maki, why, why... Enough! W-wait wait wait! NO NO NO NO! Wait wait wait! No! No! NO! Ow! Enough. I'm going. MAKI! MAKI! Coffee or tea? GO! HOOOOOOME! Dear God, the "eternal love" I had vowed that day... ...what am I supposed to do now? This brings me back! Whoa! I'm sorry! No no, it's okay! I'm so sorry! Wow... Here you are... Thanks... Pretty... I'M BAAAAAACK! Welcome back! HARUTA-SAN!!!! Welcome back! Welcome back! Glad to be back! Haruta! You could've taken the day off, you know. He doesn't need days off. Get to work. Shut up! Thank you for all your hard work in the last year. Chief! Haruta Soichi has returned from his Hong Kong mission in one piece! Ah, that's right. There's someone I need to introduce. That guy from before? This is our new employee who was just assigned here this month. Yamada-kun. Yamada...M-Masayo- No no! No Masayoshi... Justice. Justice? Please call me JUSTICE! Whoa whoa. A little close, aren'tcha? Justice. Okay okay. JUSTIIICE. Haruta-san. I look forward to working together. Count on me! Um...where is Maki? What? Good morning, Sales Office. I am Mamiana, from the Development Department. What-ana? Ana? Is he from HQ? We are in charge of the Tokyo Bay Laputa project. HQ has given us permission to use this office. So, if you could all get out of here in a timely manner.... Chief, what is this about? Chief Kurosawa. It's been a long time. Mamiana-san. Suddenly telling us to "get out"....don't you see the problem with that? For real. Why all of a sudden? How are we supposed to do our jobs? The official announcement will be made next week, but the Sales Office will also have a hand in the project. So, please lend us you power...though it's more than we'll ever need. More than you need? Of course, we want to help if we can. But, isn't this all a bit sudden? Sorry for the delay! Maki Maki Maki! C-come he- The preparations are complete. Good work. Haruta. Maki transferred back to HQ last week. Wait, really? You didn't know? Even though you're dating? That's enough. Get to work! Time is of the essence. Do it quickly. What the hell is going on?! Only the necessities, alright? Maki! What's happening? You have a lot of explaining to do! It'd be good if you let go of him. HUUUUUUUUHH??!!!! What is up with that guy?! He's all like...like.. Come on... That's the way he looked at me. Geez, don't get so grumpy about it. Even if you tell me not to... Here you are! Curry & Chocolate Sauce Half & Half! W-w-wait, I didn't order this!! I ordered oyakodon. Stop being so picky. Shut up and eat it! "Shut up"? Whatever, just eat already. The place looks nice. Right? Here, just try a bite. Nah, I'm good. Seriously. Don't "ohhh" me! What is the idiot combo up to? This tastes like shit, seriously! Don't say that! Anyway, I already knew about Maki going back to HQ. Are you serious? Why? Eh? What happened in the last year?! He's changed. Are you sure that's not because you cheated on him? I did NOT! Wait. He told you about that too? No....that was... I found a man drunk and passed out in the middle of the street. So I gave him a safe place to sleep. And then I fell asleep too. You're in the wrong! WHY? I did a good thing! Well, when you've been together for a while, you do run into those period of fatigue. What? Are things going well for you and your boyfriend? Boyfriend? What happened to that hot butler-like guy? You broke up? Well, I mean. If people grow up in different environments...and have different interests... And different values too...y'know? So, when we mutually looked at our future, we decided to break up. TEPPEI! SHE GOT DUMPED, DIDN'T SHE?! I BROKE UP WITH HIM! CHEERS! I was the one who dumped HIM! I was! Ugh! Cheers! I dumped HIM! You'll find another guy. I'M HOOOOME! MAAAAAKIII!! Makimakimakiiiii! You've been drinking... I'm not drunk at all... Yeah you are. I just said I'm not! What what what... What? I had no idea you returned to HQ. What's that about? Huh? What's with that? I was planning to have a nice relaxed talk with you about it, that's why I went to Hong Kong. But that's not what ended up happening, now is it? That really wasn't what it looked like! Nothing happened! It's fine. I didn't think anything had happened anyway. Then why is the atmosphere between us so bad right now? Even though I'm back after a whole year... It's not that. I'm just tired, that's all. You're not gonna eat this right? I'll eat it! I'll eat it! Geh...gehnioos 7... Genius 7. It's the project team that President Hayami holds in high regards. What's that? Moving on, we will introduce the project team in charge of the Tokyo Bay Laputa project. Members of Genius 7, please come up to the stage. Huh? Aren't those the guys that came marching in the other day? Eh? They're Genius 7? And why's Maki there? This project is a plan to make the biggest resort in Japan in the Tokyo Bay area after the Olympics. To help in this, we have enlisted the help of an Asia-wide organization. With Phoenix Mountain Resort's cooperation and sponsorship, we have created a joint team named "Genius 7". Through this project, I hope to create a "town that is loved by all the world"... to make "a city overflowing with the smiles of a million people" a dream I have had since I joined this company. It's like they're in a different world than we are... We may have forgotten, but Maki was an elite back at HQ. He only joined our team so he could gain hands-on experience Did Maki ever tell you about that dream? He didn't.... We are here to ask the Sales Division for the negotation rights of land acquisition by the end of the month. Huh? There's no way. That large of an area? It's unreasonable to be doing this in the middle of the month... Lastly, for a word from the chairman. ALL FOR GENIUS! ALL FOR GENIUS! GENIUS FOR ALL! GENIUS FOR ALL! So, if you could relocate to a new location... That's tough. All of us here already have a dedicated customer-base. That's true~ Thank you for your time! These are the circumstances I wanted to ask about... Just be honest... What if we pay you 5 (million yen)? This is- It doesn't matter how many times you ask. The answer is "no". Will you at least take the flyer and read it? Tokyo Bay Laputa Resort - A city overflowing with a million smiles! Here you go! A flyer. Tokyo Bay Laputa Resort! Take it! Take it! Please! You can't just easily get people to move from land that was passed down through the generations. Exactly! I'm with you! Right? And what about that guy...Mamiana or whatever. I've got a bad feeling about him. Right? And he's always looking down on us. Yes! AGREEEE! AGREEEEE!! It's amazing, Jus. It doesn't feel like we only just met. I feel the same. So, what club activities did you do in highschool? Basketball. Same as me! What position? Point guard. ME TOO! But I was... (Both) A BENCHWARMER! JUSTIIIICE! Pardon the intrusion! Excuse me... I'm getting ready to open the shop. My apologies for visiting at a busy time. I'm Haruta from Tenkuu Real Estate- Ah...you're back, huh? Actually, we are planning on constructing a new shopping mall in this area... How many times do I have to tell you to leave?! Sorry! Our apologies for intruding. I'm sorry! All we can do is keep trying and see if they come around. Thank you very much. For what? It's just....you protected me just now. It was nothing! Haruta-san...I feel like you're my big brother. Big brother? Yeah. C'mon... We got shut down at every place we went. The money isn't the problem. What do you wanna eat tonight? Will you be late? I'm gonna try making fried chicken. Hot! Around what time will you be coming home? Hellloo? Hot!!! I'm hooome... It's black as coal... You gotta be kidding me... Welcome home. I'm back. Hey, Maki? I know you're busy and all...but can you at least answer my texts? Sorry. I worked hard to cook for you. If we're gonna get married, we're gonna need to communicate and cooperate with eachother, y'know? When you say "marriage", do you really mean it? Huh? Nevermind. No no no. What? Did you think I was joking when I asked you to marry me? No, I didn't. It's just... Actually, wouldn't it be better if we didn't rush it? I wasn't really planning to rush it though... Mom?! Why are you here all of a sudden? Sorry for the short notice, but I'm gonna move back in here with Ataru-kun. Huh? I still have no idea who Ataru-kun even is! Now, where did I leave my bank deposit book? Are you sure you're not being scammed by that guy? Good evening! Good evening! Long time no see. I see! Your friend is still living here? Oh, right... Sorry, mom. I haven't told you yet but actually, we are- It's fine, ma'am! I'm actually planning to move back in with my parents. Yeah, it's closer to HQ. I'll be leaving soon. You sure that's alright? Yeah! It's fine! No, it's not. See ya. A few days later, Maki packed his things and went back home. The sales division is currently trying their best to make negotiations, but... We were hoping you could give us more time. No, no, no. Chief Kurosawa. We don't have time to dilly-dally about. But the Bay Area is historical, and has many old shops! We need time to talk to each owner one-on-one if we want our negotiations to be successful. If you aren't able to meet HQ's demands, I'm going to have to ask you to withdraw from the project. Even though I've heard much about your excellent leadership skills. No, no. I never said I couldn't do it, now did I? Please. Hurry. U- P. YES! I! DO! Let's think of a counterplan. I've just sent you the files. Choko-san. Long time no see. Likewise. Same to you. Hey...is he alright? The doctor is still examining him, so we're also waiting for the results... Excuse me? Would you happen to be Mr. Kurosawa's family? (Everyone) YES! How is his condition? Has he regained consciousness? It's fine! No issues were found during the examination. However, he should still rest in the hospital for a few days. Will he never open his eyes again? He's just sleeping right now. He's fine. Is he really okay, doctor?! Don't worry! He's basically indestructible. But, Mrs. Kurosawa... Hey, now. That's ex-Mrs. Kurosawa. She's mine! Chief... Even though Chief got injured and ended up in the hospital, Maki didn't show up. And he moved out too! Is work really that important? How petty of you! Your mind is as narrow as a sake cup! How? Jealousy is super uncool. No, it's not a matter of jealousy. It's more of an issue with the point of our crotches, as humans. Did you mean "point of honor"? (crotch = kokan, honor = koken) We shouldn't point at our crotches! Crotch... Honor! Good evening. Maki-kun! Welcome! How is Chief doing? Well, he's still asleep...but there's no problems. I'm glad to hear that. I'm sorry I couldn't make it to the hospital. So...that "Whatever Seven" thing...do they have you working that hard? Yeah, it's a huge workload. It's taking all my energy just to keep up. It'll all be worth nothing if you end up destroying your body over it. Even so, this is the most alive I've felt in my life. I totally get it. I wanna work hard for the next 10 years, so I can be a company owner by the time I'm 40. Company owner? You've been thinking about doing that? Let's do our best! What about you, Haruta? Don't you have a dream you wanna achieve? H-huh, what? A dream I wanna achieve? Haruta. It doesn't matter how old you get. Having a dream will always be important. Then what's your dream, Teppei? What's my dream, you ask? To play in a packed Budokan. No, no, no. No way. That'll never happen. Shut up! I don't wanna hear that from a guy who doesn't even have a dream. People are gonna be on a waiting list. Waiting list? To get tickets for his show. What? You're gonna sing now? You can always have a big dream~ It takes me back to when I was just a boy~ Dreaming, Dreaming~ Even if I achieve a lofty dream~ Do you remember? You promised me we'd go this year. Yeah. But aren't you busy? I'm free that day. What about you? Of course, I'm free. You forgot, didn't you? I did not! You totally did! No I didn't! Enough! Why? I remember- W-w-w-what... Ow! Owowowow....what is it? You had a piece of fried burdock in your hair. Why? Why? Okay. Say "aaaah". That's it, open up. No, no, no! We can't go wasting food! That's it! Good boy~ Why? How long was that in my hair? Well, see ya. Let's start with Haruta. Alright! Good morning! Chief! Sorry I'm late. We were so worried!! Chief, shouldn't you get more rest? I'm fine, look! Fit as a fiddle! Yo! That's our chief! Are you sure it was an accident? No one pushed you, right? What are you talking about? There's no way! Anyway, I'm just really glad you've recovered! Thank goodness! And you are...? Huh? Chief, that's not a very nice joke. What's your name? Boss...don't tell me you've forgotten... HUH? No, no... What about me? You're Takekawa-kun, obviously. And me? You're Segawa Maika. And I'm Kuribayashi what-maro? Um.... Utamaro, duh. YEEEES! What's going on? Justice! JUSTICE!!!! W-w-wa-wa-wa-wait wait wait! Chief! CHIEFCHIEFCHIEFCHIEF! What's your name? EHHHHH??! What's going on? Why did he only forget me? Does this kind of amnesia even exist?! After that, Chief tried his best to try and remember me. Thank you very much! Alright, let's go. Watch out!! Chief, Chief! Chief? Haru...? Yes! Yes! H-Haru! Harutan. Haaaarutan. Haruta-kun! So close!!! Haruta-kun! Shall we go? If he was able to lose all our memories up until now there's no way they'd be recovered that easily. But.. Bibibibibibi... biiiiiiii BIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII! How many times do I have to tell you? The answer is no! Of course, we understand how you feel. But this is for the sake of building a new town filled with smile- SHUT UP AND GET THE HELL OUT! Actually, we're here today to ask you something different... Chief, what is this about? Well, we know nothing about the udon business, right? Why would he negotiate with someone who doesn't even understand his way of life? Oh...you're completely right. Haruta-san, you have some flour on your cheek. Ah, sorry~ I just made it worse... What are you doing, huh? You're a little too close, no? Oh, it's just...I really love Haruta-san! You feel the same, right? Yeah, sure! Thank goodness! Is that true? Chief? Ah, that's right! Haruta-san, I was wondering if you wanted to live together! Why are you asking now? I heard from Maika-san that your roommate moved out. C-Chief! Really? Yeah. Huh? Don't tell me...Chief has feelings for me again. There's no way! Why don't we try playing VR basketball sometime? Sure! Sounds like fun! W-what are you doing? Wait a minute... I, Kurosawa Musashi, can play a mean game of igo. Huh? Is this for real?! There's no way. It's all in my head. Huh? What is this? What's up? Even that old man can smile like this... They sure look happy... What's up, Jus? No, it's nothing. Watch out! Haruta... What are you guys doing? GET THE HELL OUT! We're very sorry! You better be at next week's conference, got it? Sorry, I'm almost done. Why don't you go home for the night? Ah, but...ever since I moved back in with my parents it's been a lot easier. Hmm? You're not living together anymore? Sorry, it's just that I heard you were living with someone. Oh....yeah. But, uhm... Living with someone can be hard, you know? What is it? Does Professor Mamiana need to give you a special lesson in love? Nah, I'm good. Well, dating someone and becoming a family with them are two different things. I'm finally doing a job I love. So I was thinking I should put all my power into that. But... But if if my partner and I can't see eye-to-eye during the hard times... ...it's hard for me to envision what it'll be like as we move forward living together. It's tough when you can't mutually understand and cheer eachother on in fulfilling your dreams. Hey. I wanna take you somewhere. I think I still have flour in my ear... Let me see. What the hell? Cut it out! The hell? You asshole! Hey, hey... Why'd you get all quiet when you saw that photo at the udon place? No reason... You can tell me! Oh man, it's so hot in here all of a sudden! I'm gonna step out for a bit. He sucks at lying... Guess I should go out too. Oh, Chief. Sorry for making you wait. No, no. I was actually just about to leave. ...Okay. Well... This whole negotiation thing sure is hard.... It is. Getting your feelings across to someone else is a difficult thing to do. Yeah... What's the best way to go about it? Uh...for me, being straightforward is the best. I see. Yeah. I love you. Huh? Haru...pon. H-Haru..p-pon? Uh...I've started to fall for you. Chief! When I first- W-wait Chief... When I first met you, Haru-pon... Well, I mean, technically we have met before. Yeah, yeah... I felt a sort of spark. O-Ohhh? Okay. A s-spark... How about you, Harupon? Harupon? How do you feel? I'm...in a serious relationship with someone. Yeah.. And that person is... Jus- No. -tice? Absolutely not. Jus- Nope. Why has he only forgotten about Haruta-kun? Perhaps the pain of rejection left a deep scar in his heart... When I think about it, I pity Chief. Whoever pushed him down the stairs... is unforgivable! No, no! It seems like he fell down on his own! Everyone's worrying over nothing! No, no, no... Don't "no no no" me! It's true! That's impossible. Impossible? He said so himself! That's wrong... Heellloooo? What do you want? W-w-wait, what? Chief still remembers you, right, Choko-san? It seems like he's forgotten that we're divorced, yes... That completely sucks! And I'm not really sure how to tell him if he asks... No, no... You just have to tell it to him straight! Wait, don't tell me... You still have feelings for him? No, I dont! For real? I swear. CHOKO-SAN!!! No, stop it! That means, Chief is still... Who are you dating then? Chief. About that... Tell me. Uhhh, well... Tell me. Maki? Why are you here? I should be asking you the same thing! Harupon? Oh...no no no...it's not what it looks like. I thought you had given up. What are you talking about? We've only just begun! Nothing's started. There's nothing to start. What's that supposed to mean? Maki Maki, listen. Chief, he.... ...he seems to have gotten a minor case of amnesia. Just a little bit. No, no way! That's way too convenient of a story, no? It's true though! Don't tell me...you're the one Harupon is dating? Yeah, and what if I am? Eeeeh, is that so? It is so. This kind of guy~? Yeah, you got a problem? Beating you would be a piece of cake! Piece of cake, huh?! Piece of cake! (Haruta) PIECE OF CAKE, MY ASS! Hey, Maki. Sorry I'm late. Oh, what's this? If it isn't Chief Kurosawa. Fancy meeting you here. And why are you here, Leader Mamiana?! Why am I here? I come here all the time! I just happened to invite Maki to come along this time. Just a little bit of naked bonding between men. So when you tell me you're busy, THIS is the kind of thing you're doing?! What kind of thing am I doing, huh? No wonder you moved out! HUUUH?! Sorry, one sec... You need to stop this shit, right now. Hey! What do you think you're doing?! Seems like you're terrible little cheater, Maki Ryo- What do you mean by "cheater", hu- Piece of cake~ W-w-wait! Stop, stop! Don't do it! I'm not stopping! Get off! Stop! It's freezing! If you guys have this much free time to sweat in here, why don't you get out on the street and sweat from doing your jobs?! Look who's talking! How much sweat are you shedding from the meeting room, huh?! HARUTA-SAN! What are you saying?! WHY DON'T YOU GO WORK ON THE STREETS?! So these are the leadership skills of Kurosawa that I've heard so much about! Mamiana! If you're a leader, can you list 10 good things about your subordinate? 10 good things? I could list 20 or 30! On the other hand, Chief Kurosawa. Yeah? Can you list 10 of your subordinate's problems or concerns? SURE I CAN! Harupon has a horrible case of bedhead~ He has a painful cavity in his tooth~ His feet seriously stink! His favorite kind of yakiniku is skirt steak~ His favorite actor is Saitou Takumi~ Problems...problemsproblems... That's not true! And he's got a seductive body~ There it is, there it is! There's what? YOUR TRUE NATURE! I KNEW IT ALL ALONG! That hurt! WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON? Haruta-san...your pecs are amazing!! Wow, everyone's here! Isn't this...Japanese naked male bonding? What are you talking about? I'M SO HYPE!!!! Who the hell is this? WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! JUSTICE! Justice! YOU WANNA FIGHT?! Thank you for visiting today. Due to special cleaning, we will soon be closing. Make sure not to forget any of your belongings. Well then, everyone. I think it would be for the best if kept this little brainstorming meeting a secret from the rest of the company. That'd be good. Of course. Yes, sir! Well then. Thank you for your hard work. Yes, this is Mamiana. Yes. I see... Thank you very much. I apologize for being abrupt... I would like you to break up with my son. I want him to be able to focus on his job. N-no, b-but... In times like these, I think it's best if we can support eachother- He fainted. Ryota fainted yesterday from exhaustion and was sent to the hospital. How could you not know? Ma- Get your manager! What's going on? This sucks! Everyone's super pissed off with us. They said there's no way they'll sell us their land. They're really mad. I understand how you feel! I really do! But building a resort will attract young people and make the area more lively! That's why you want us out?! You guys are tearing apart families! Let me explain again. I beg you. Please quiet down and listen. Everyone, please calm down! Do you plan to erase the history and traditions of our area?! Not at all! We also want to protect all of your shops. That's why, after the new shopping mall is built all of you will have priority- We never asked for that! You guys have no idea how we feel! Everything is going to shit!!! What am I supposed to do?! Ow! That hurt! THAT HURT! Haruta-san...why don't you play me? Even though I know I'm gonna win. No no no! No way! You were a benchwarmer too, remember? Guess I have no choice, huh? Come at me! City planning sure is hard, huh? Guess so. That land and those houses are those people's lives. Jus, why did you choose to join our company? I was thinking it'd be nice to create more happy families through my job. I totally understand! Jus, you give off an aura of happiness. I know, right~? Ah, by the way. Are you going to the fireworks festival tonight? I'm not. You cheater! I got you~! Jus! That hurts!!! (The sweaters say HARU and PON.) Hold on tight, okay? Harupon, what's that on that old building over there? That? It's a birds nest! Don't do it. Harupon, no!!! HARUPON! Hello~ C'mon, Harupon! Harupon! Harupon Harupon Harupon.... Come in. Pardon the intrusion. It's fine. Could you please confirm these papers? Chief. No, I... Today...there's a fireworks festival....isn't there? Yep. I apologize for suddenly calling you all here. But we have decided to terminate our partnership with Phoenix Mountain Resort. Terminate the partnership, huh? What do you think you're doing? An issue was found in our business contract. So, starting from today, Genius 7 is no more. Unacceptable! Does Chairman Hayami know about this? Thank you for your hard work. I'll be going now. Huh? Maki's mom? Looks like my husband said something rude to you... I'm so sorry. It's alright. But, I really might not be good enough. Plus, we're both men so that might also be why he's upset... That has nothing to do with it! There's no such thing as a "right answer" when it comes to marriage. You just have to find the answer that works best for the two of you. Yeah. The fireworks are tonight, right? Hey, what are you gonna wear? Oh, you scared me! You're still alright for tonight, right? Yeah, I am. Then let's go. They have baby castella cakes! Maki, your face looks like a baby castella cake~ Do you need to take something for motion sickness? Here. What are you so grumpy about? Why aren't you wearing a yukata? Huh? You're grumpy about that? I'm too embarassed to wear a yukata! Choko! This kind of occasion is when you wear a yukata! Sorrryyy~ It's alright. I love you~ Your grumpiness is all gone now? Don't you someone you want to watch the fireworks together with? It'd be nice if they could set their sights on you someday... Yeah.. Y'know, I haven't been to a fireworks festival since I was in college. Did you go with Chizu-san? When we were little, we all went together. Can I have a bite? I knew that was coming. C'mon, we can trade! Have a bit of mine! I don't wanna! Come onnnn...pretty please? So beautiful... Choko... Don't. I have no plans to get married again. Why not? You know how much of an age-difference we have between us? It's just as I thought...you're not over Chief. You still have feelings for him. That's not it at all. We may be doing well now, but what will we do when we're past the honeymoon phase? I don't think... I could handle that a second time. What is that one? What could it be? Looks like a tangerine. It was probably a tangerine. That's what it looked like. I gotta go to the bathroom. Need anything? Nah, I'm stuffed! (Mamiana Jin) "Do you have time now?" "I need to talk to you about the future." "Where are you?" "I can meet you nearby." "Maki." "Is there any way we can meet tonight?" When you say "marriage", do you really mean it? What are you looking at? Sorry, it wouldn't stop ringing. Haruta-san, sorry...this i- It's fine. Why don't you just go? You don't have time to watch the fireworks with me, right? Just go and meet Mamiana already. Why do you have to say it with an attitude? He's more important to you than I am, isn't he? All you talk about is "work, work, work"..."dreams, dreams".... "Mamiana"... You know...I saw him picking you up from the hospital yesterday. So what? You didn't even tell me you fainted! I didn't want to tell it to someone like you, who makes a big deal out of everything. "Makes a big deal out of everything"? Like what you're doing right now! KEEP THINGS A SECRET FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE, THEN! I'm going. Maki, you sure have changed. You're the one who hasn't grown up. Are you looking down on me now that you're at HQ? You disgust me. Lately, all you do is piss me off! I have 100 times more fun when I hang out with Justice. And Mamiana-san wouldn't say childish shit like what you just said! Enough. Let's just break up. Yeah. We should. Thank you for everything. Are you sure that was the right thing? Jus! Y'know, I was actually just looking for someone to watch the fireworks with. Why don't we watch them together? The fireworks are over the- Stop screwing around. I... ...really do love you, Haruta-san. As a person...and as my senior. I get it, alright?! Why are you bringing that up now? Shit... What did you just throw? A ring. You idiot... Hey...Hey, Jus! Idiot! You idiot! Idiotidiotidiotidiot! It's fine! Get out of there! C'mon! Jus, I said it was fine. Get out- Would you just shut up?! Jus... Haruta-san... You have to tell him how you really feel! Why are you mad? My parents and big brother... ...passed away in an accident three years ago. It was on my brother's birthday, too. Can you guess what the last thing I ever said to him was? "Shut up, already!" ...that's what it was. I didn't even wish him a happy birthday. All I did was tell him to shut up. Haruta-san. It's never guaranteed... ...that the ones you love will still be here tomorrow. That's why... I want you to tell him how you really feel. Why are you crying? Found it... It isn't beautiful at all.. "STORE CLOSURE. Thank you for your patronage, it was greatly appreciated." No way... Gorou-san? It's over. I've sold it. No, but... That new resort you're building... ...it doesn't suit small business such as ours. W-w-wait! Where are you going? There's nothing else we can do but talk to Germanium 7 directly!! Let's go. This is all your fault, Mamiana-kun! My apologies, sir. What are we supposed to do? She's been taken hostage! What? Hostage?! Who? What could those Phoenix Mountain guys possibly want to talk to my daughter about?! It's basically a kidnapping, no? Hurry up and call the cops! Sir. Even if your daughter returns safely, once it's found out that you have connections to that group, it will compromise our company's reputation. So you're just going to give them all that land? Just leave everything to me. ...Well, shit. Seriously. How so? Hey...wasn't Mamiana-san acting strangely just now? How..? Wait, I think I know! Perhaps Mamiana-san has been a part of the Phoenix Mountain group all along! He took advantage of us and got us to buy up all the land... ...so that he could have it all- What are you guys doing here? Uhm! Wait! Wait! Haruta. Yes? At 8 tonight, I want you to meet me at Tokyo Bay City Hotel. Understood. Only me?! Hello? Come in. Pardon the intrus- Huh? Why's he in a bathrobe? Do you wanna have a shower? N-no, I'm good. What is this development?! Don't tell me, Mamiana-san.... EEEEEEH?! W-w-wait! Hold on! Sorry... Hey...wait a sec... If I give up my body to him... ..maybe he'll leave Maki alone? Why were you outside the meeting room? Why were two people from the sales division outside of the HQ meeting room? Um. I have something I wanna say to you, Mamiana-san. What is it? Well...you said we'd be making a town with a million smiles. But no one there is smiling anymore! Not Takimoto-san from the kimono shop...not Sakaguchi who owns the produce shop... And not Gorou-san...the udon shop owner. What are you planning? The truth is...you've been the mastermind behind all of this, right? The mastermind? That's a good one! I was contacted by an acquaintance who's in law enforcement. They told me...Phoenix Mountain Resort has their hand in the drug trade. The resort plan was all a cover. They actually plan to use the Bay Area land as a transfer point for dealing narcotics. I see.. Drugs?! That's why I ended our business partnership. Terminate our business partnership? That's unnacceptable! If this gets out, we'll be attacked, even though we aren't the ones in the wrong. But...it's now my responsibility to protect our company. You can't let anyone know what you heard today in the meeting room. Maki and I will take care of this. You...and Maki? What's wrong? Uh...could I come along with you? We need to properly communicate our feelings. I think they'll understand if we're honest and sincere with them. And I'm like... the Grand General of Sincerity. Not happening. Go back to the sales division and focus on your work. Got it? 'Kaaaaaay.... I apologize for the intrusion. I'm here to sincerely ask all of you if you could please release the Chairman's daughter. I know this is a difficult topic, but- What exactly is your reason for coming here? W-w-w-wait! Give me a second! A topic like this, should be discussed in an open and sincere manne- I'M JOKING, I'M JOKING! NONONONONO! It's truly unfortunate that you are still unable to understand our needs. We will now ask you to cancel the termination of our partnership within the next 24 hours. And resume your partnership with us. If you are unable to fulfill our needs, we won't be able to guarantee the safety of our two hostages. ...Two? Let go of me! Where are we anyway? Screw off! Haruta-san... That IDIOT! Hey! TIME LIMIT: 24 hours Who the hell are you? I'm Haruta Soichi, from Tenkuu Real Estate! I'm Kaoruko. Wanna bite? Nah, I'm good. Have you come to rescue me? Well, that was the plan...but then they captured me too. What the hell are you doing? I'm sorry. It's fine. Cellphone. You have a phone right? I'm tellin' you to take your damn phone out! Your phone!! So you do have one! Now call someone! Hurry and do it! Call a number already. Yes? Come in. Chief Kurosawa, something terrible has happened. What is it? I'm sorry, but it looks like I've been captured. Haruta, where are you? Uh...I have no idea at all. Someone, go get a map. YES, SIR! Haruta, what can you see from there? I....I can smell the sea breeze! Somewhere close to the ocean then... Haruta-san, is there anything else? W-wait. Give me a sec.... I see pink smokestacks! Pink smokestacks, pink smokestacks, pink smokestacks! Here! They belong to the Sakura Cement Factory!! Sakura Cement! Haruta! Haruta!! How many of the smokestacks can you see from there? ....2! 2 of them! So, a place where only 2 out of 5 are visible. Where is it? Where is it? WHERE IS IT? SHIT! THIS IS BAD! MY PHONE'S AT 2%, IT'S GONNA DIE! SHIT! What should I do?! Haruta-san! Shut up for a sec! A train? A TRAIN! There's a railway nearby! A train! Where is it? A train...train...where... You guys? Couldn't he just turn on his GPS to find his location? Haruta-san! Open up your map app! Map app! Okay, okay! Give me a sec! IT DIED!!! You better not say "It died". Near both the ocean and a train line... ...where only 2 chimneys would be visible. Here! Alright! Let's split up and find him! Yes, sir! W-w-w-wait!!! What is that? Can't you tell? It's a time bomb. NO WAY! YOU'RE LYING, RIGHT? Should I cut the red wire? NO NO NO NO! What are you doing? Why do you wanna cut it? We'll die if I don't! That's not true! Please don't! Let me do it! W-w-w-wait...hold on... Does this mean there's 20 hours left? I'm cuttin' the red one. NO, DON'T!! DON'T! SERIOUSLY, DON'T DO IT! I'M BEGGING YOU! Fine! Geez...I got it! I understand! I'm not gonna cut it! ...The time went down. NOW WE ONLY HAVE 10 MINUTES?! My bad. Must've cut the wrong one. Even though it was a 50/50 chance... The blue one was right. What are you doing? This sucks... I have good intuition, don't worry. HOW DO YOU FIGURE?! STOP, STOP! Haruta-san! Haruta-kun!! Ouch! Hurry up and get it open! There's so many things I still wanna do in life. In the future, I wanna marry a guy like Johnny Depp and- Are you even listening? I'm talkin' to you. Do you have any things you still wanna do? I have a bunch! What's up? Did you get dumped? Well...I was the one who did it... Mm? You dumped them? No... I thought I would only be a burden on his path to success... So you pulled away. How noble. You're wrong. It was all because I was jealous. Jealousy...and nothing more. Ah...happens a lot. This sucks! If I knew things would end like this, I would've cheered him on from the start! Shit... Oh no. There's only 30 seconds left. Got it. Let's find him. Chief. Maki. This is bad. We still haven't found him. This is our last chance...let's just throw the bomb out the window! Actually, that's a surprisingly good idea! Go! Show 'em what you got! You idiots!!! What the hell was that?! Don't tell me... Dammit! Don't tell me...Chief went inside? Chief? JUSTICE! JUSTIIIIICE! What is this?! What are you doing? That's dangerous! I'll do it. No, me! What are you doing? I'll do it! What the hell! I said I'm doing it! You can't! Hang in there! It'll only get worse from here. Go back. It'll be dangerous for you too. I'll go on ahead. This is an order from your senior! Go back! I see your plan. You're pretending to have amnesia and trying to have your one last chance with him. I just wanna properly tell him how I feel!! I think he knows without you saying! Oh, there it is! What? The heroine who won't say anything but wants the other person to understand their feelings- and give them attention. THAT'S WHO YOU ARE! WHAT THE HELL?! It's cause you have too much pride, right? You're afraid to say how you really feel, huh? WOULD YOU JUST SHUT UP?! Hit the bulls-eye, Maki! This isn't the time- Showing all of you...even the parts that aren't so cool... ...that's what true love is all about! Huh? What's going on? What? HARUTA-SAN! JUS!!! Kaoruko-san, hurry! Hurry! Watch your head... HARUTA-SAN! HARUTA! Don't worry about me! Get Kaoruko to- I CAN'T! I don't want to experience this kind of thing again! It'll be fine! Go! HARUTA-SAAAAAAAAAN! 1,2... HARUTA! HARUTA-SAN! Haruta-san. Harupon. Harupon! Haruta-san. HARUPOOOON! Haruta-san! He's not breathing! No! Haruta...Haruta-san.! Harupon! Harupon! HARUTA-SAN! I'll do it. Haruta-san... What are you saying? You're in the way! I'M DOING IT! Screw off, asshole! Just once. ONCE, MY ASS! HARUPON WILL BE MY SNOW WHITE! WHAT THE HELL ARE TALKING ABOUT?! WATCH OUT! Haruta-san! Haruta-san! HARUPON!! ARE YOU ALRIGHT? Maki! Chief! Hurry up and get over here, you two! Please just go first, Chief! You idiot! How could I just leave my subordinates here and go?! Enough, Chief! Just go! Chief, I'm begging you! Please go!! Shit! Shit!! Chief, please! Go!! SHIIIIIIT! I'LL....BE... BAAAAAACK!!! Sure is hot in here... Sure is...crazy how that works. Hey...can I take it back? Saying I wanted to break up. Right now? It's just... You were the only one with a dream. You were busy every day... and it just got me so upset. But I also have a dream. What are you talking about? Aren't you gonna ask what it is? Not right now I'm not. Ask! There was never anything between Mamiana-san and I, for the record. I'm not sure where you even got that idea, but we only discussed business. Got it. WATCH OUT! MAKI! Maki! Maki! Maki! Are you okay? I'm fine! You go on ahead! HURRY UP AND RIDE ME! HURRY! Chief!! Chief! Are you okay? Inside...the others are still inside! It's okay! The rescue workers are on their way! In the meantime, sit here! Are you hurt? Any injuries? I'm fine. Chief, give me your foot. Thank you. Chief? What's the matter? Oh my god... OH MY GOOOOODDDDDD!!! Seriously? This must be what fried chicken feels like... when it's being cooked. Rather than fried chicken... ...it's more like yakitori, no? That's true. Maki, y'know... ...you're ssssssuper particular. I think you're just sloppy. Is that bad? Not at all. Y'know... I really did wanna become a family with you, Maki. What are you saying? But... I was completely clueless. Gay couples... We still can't get married...at least not in the eyes of the law. And also... I reallllly...love kids. There's just... So many things to think about. Same for me. I just used being busy as an excuse. I couldn't even properly communicate with you. Soon we only started to see eachother's flaws. I was so afraid of destroying the relationship we had built. I was convinced that the deeper I fell in love... ...the more I'd end up suffering. Can I say something? Sure. Um... From now on... ...no matter how much we fight, even if...you no longer wanna cook for me, even if we don't wash our underwear in the same load, even if you answer my messages late, even when you get fat, and go bald, and your farts get reaaaaallly stinky, all your teeth fall out... ...and you have to wear a full set of dentures. Even if you go senile, and you can't remember how we met, or... ...if you no longer recognize me. Even then, I... ...even then... I.. ...I'll only wanna be with you, Maki! Even if I die, I want to be with you. Me too. I only wanna be with you, Haruta-san. GUYS! That's hot!! HARUTA-SAAAAN! Maki... Chief! Haru... tan? Harutan? -tan! Harutan! Harutan! HARUTAAAAAAN! HIS MEMORIES CAME BACK! Chairman, we have a request. Please reconsider this Bay Area redevelopment plan. Reconsider it? Every single person there doesn't want that area to become a resort. We are hoping you can think it through and make a town that will truly make people happy. Chairman, if you would... please think it over. Please! This was a plan devised by HQ. The sales division has no say in it. But, Chairma- Chairman! It's exactly as they say. Mamiana-kun... When did we stop listening to the voice of the people? From the start...we were all here because we wanted to make people smile. That's why we chose this job. From now on, I think we should work together with the sales division, as they know the residents best... ...as we move forward with this project. But...who will be our new partner? Excuse me. Haruta-san. Mr. Chou from Baolai Funds in Hong Kong is here to see you. Who? From Hong Kong? Me? What did you do this time? I don't know! Oh, long time no see! Um, I'm sorry...w-who are you...? Look! You dropped this, didn't you? Oh, this! The old guy from that time! That happened! That happened! I wanted to thank you for protecting that family heirloom from falling. You're a godsend! To think BaoLai Funds would be our new partner. It's amazing that you knew that guy! I wouldn't say I know him... But, he sure is a nice guy! Looks like we'll be working closely. Yes. Actually, there's somewhere I wanna take you. The employees of the Phoenix Mountain Resort Company are exiting the building! They have been accused of trying to use the Bay Area as a hub for their drug trade. If it weren't for Haruta sneaking into HQ that day, the Bay Area would've been swarmed with drug traffickers! I can't believe Haruta saved Japan! He's our... ...heeeero~ Your hero hasn't shown up yet, Chizu-chan? Guess not, huh? Haven't you decided off marriage, so you can focus on work? Don't put words in my mouth! I can have a job and a family at the same time, but they'll both have to be the best! I don't even know what you're talking about. How about you, MaiMai? Not at all. I'm gonna rule the whole world. Rule the world, huh? Why did you bring me here? I saw that picture when I was in your hotel room. The same one I saw in this shop. Even that old guy can smile like that? When I was little, not many people came to our shop... ...life was hard. So I started to hate udon and even my own father. Then I left home. He probably never wants to see me again. I don't think that's the case. And what do you know? Gorou-san told me himself. Are you really okay with closing your store? There's no way that guy's gonna come home anyway. He's living his own life now. Sorry for taking so long. You and Gorou-san probably feel the same. Even if things are broken, you can pick up the pieces. That goes for towns... and for families too. What should I have? I'll have tanuki soba. Not having udon? Chief! I'd like to ask... ...for Choko's hand in marriage! What are you saying?! Can you make her happy? ...Probably. Surely. ABSOLUTELY! I WILL DEFINITELY MAKE HER HAPPY! In that case, I'll support you! Wholeheartedly. Choko-san. Would you please marry me? Even though I feel like I keep screwing up... Yes, I will! Yes, I did it!! Chiiief! Yes, that's it. Make her happy. Even though I'm still immature, I will make sure the two of us are happy! Why don't you sit down? Why so cocky? Overseas? The development team in Singapore in interested in you working for them. Ah, but...you have a family, don't you? It's not that easy to decide. I understand, I have 5 kids. Mamiana-san, you have kids? 5 of them?! Huh? I never told you? So, you're married? I am. Well, it's not a bad offer. Why don't you think it over? Singapore, huh... I politely decline! Becoming a project leader for HQ is a hard thing to do. Being a leader doesn't suit me. I want to continue walking on these streets, building new towns and helping those that live here. That's... ...my dream now. Very Haruta-like. Yep. I'm counting on you, then. Yes, sir! I'm off! JUS JUS!!! KAORUKO-SAN, CONGRATS! CONGRATS! What happened between you two? She kept asking me out. I did! But it's also thanks to Haruta-san. Huh? How so? I was so afraid of finding happiness. But after meeting you, I realized I need to do my best both in love and work! Isn't that great, Jus~? Be happy!! One more thing! Yes? I'm gonna have a big family, and- I'm gonna take over as Chairman. That's messed up, man! LOVE AND PEACE! LOVE AND PEEEEACE! Whatever! Yaaay! Everyone's so happy. They are. I think I should take a hiatus from love. Oh...they're gonna do the bouquet toss. It's alright...if you don't love me back. I rather love someone...than be loved. (This is a song title I think.) Seriously. HERE I GOOOO! I, Kurosawa Musashi, am gonna find happiness! Well, I should be going. Rise to greatnes, Maki! I'm not a bureaucrat, silly. I won't fall behind. Not when I'm thinking of you working hard on the other side of the world. It'll make me work hard too. It's not the other side of the world. So particular! Just like always! Haruta-san, you too. Fulfill your dreams. See you soon... ...Ryota. Why'd you say my first name? Y-your turn, try it. Don't wanna. No, try it! No! Do it! I'm going... ...Souichi. Well, then. See ya.
