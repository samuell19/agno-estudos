There was once a time when people could neither read nor write. They could only speak and listen. Like you do. The fairy tales had to be told at that time. Only later when the script was invented the best of us have started to preserve stories for generations. Like I do. In my book... here I must add one more freckle. There are three of them: Sleeping Beauty, Little Red Riding Hood and Mary and the twelve Months. No need to raise your hands; I know what you want to say. You want to tell me that you know them already. I expected that. But I'm sure you haven't heard much about the three young men. Without them, these adventures would never have become fairy tales; instead, they would be tragedies not fit for children's ears. Well now, listen carefully. Once upon a time, very long ago there was a farmer and his wife who had three sons: Jack, Joe and Matt. - Look, there's loads of them here! - Where? Where? Just look at that, your pants are all dirty. Matt, quit dawdling and get to picking. No bees, no honey, no work, no money. Next time plums please. They're easier to pick. - What's wrong, Jack? - I can't find my mug! That's just like you. We'll all be looking for a mug instead of berries. Here it is! Jack Wow, look how much he's got already! Daddy! Boys, dammit! Be good! - Here you are! - Thanks. In there! Hold on! Hold on tight, boys! Give me that! Easy there, easy! Whoa! Good girls! To the left! So, got any blueberries? Show me. - That's a pretty crappy haul, Joe. - I tripped. - What about you, Jack? Where's your mug? - I must have left it behind... somewhere. Oh dear. What about you, Matt? I guess we're gonna have beetle pie, then. Some farmers you'll make. Can't wait to see that. All right, lads, let's get to it. A young miller's wife sat in a gold carriage And went to the priest to ask about marriage. Oh Reverend Father, tell me how to pray If I want my husband to do as I say. I'm sorry, good woman... Hold on! That's just like him. How many times have I told him to watch where he puts his things?! - Where were we? - "I'm sorry, good woman..." I'm sorry, good woman, there is no such prayer... Forgetting things may lead to some very bad ends, Jack. My own dad, your granddad, once told me what happened up at the castle, where the princess lived. And what was that? Let me think... What was it that he said? There was once a time when the castle wasn't as overgrown as it is now. It could be seen from far and wide. It had such beautiful turrets... We don't have enough blueberries, kids. The pie will be a bit dry. And so many leaves in there! Oh no, no, no. You can't tangle up a good story with leaves and berries. So if it's all right with everyone, I think I'm going to take over now. Does everyone agree? That seems to be an overwhelming majority. So, in that castle, a king lived with his queen. The king's rule was fair and wise. And so crops were plentiful, the woods were free of bandits, and people were content. But still the king and queen were sad. "Why was that?" Well, a house with no baby is a sad house indeed. What about this one? For a baby girl? I've already had that one. And this? To try for a little boy? We've both had that one. This one, then? For twins? I don't think I've tried that one. Have I? Yes, you have, dear. You said it was corroding your stomach. Oh, right, I couldn't quite stomach that. Not that one, then. Nothing works. That is quite vexing. So let the story start For young, and young at heart. Come watch a tale unfurl About a gentle girl. Her beauty shone clear as a flame A rose she was in truth and name. Remind me to shorten the hours they have to work in the king's fields. I feel like I'm exploiting them. Already writing it down, Your Grace. And you, remind me to have the road repaired. Already on it, Your Grace. What's your note? To remind him to get a new Spanish collar for me. I want such a collar too, of course. Did he promise one to you? No, he didn't. But I'll remind him anyway. So, I will remind him the same. Do this every night. One drop on the forehead, one drop on the chest, and one on the bellybutton. - That should be enough. - I shall reward you handsomely. I have no need of your money, king. I only ask to be invited to the christening. Certainly, I'll see to that. Promises, promises. You have much on your mind. You're going to be too happy to remember what an old crone from the swamp has done for you. I do have much on my mind, but I shall not forget. I give you my word. I always tie a knot on my handkerchief. To remember what I mustn't forget. Here is your potion, king. May it bring you happiness. I'll be waiting. On the forehead, on the chest, on the bellybutton. Who was supposed to remember the first drop? Me. The first drop goes on the forehead. - The second one? - On the chest. Turn around, then. And I was supposed to remember the third drop. Where was that meant to go? On the bellybutton! And so we sat night after night And prayed to God to end our plight To end our longing and despair. And it seems He heard our prayer A baby girl shone like a flame And new joy to the kingdom came. Bring the crib from out the attic The Godmothers will be ecstatic! The Godmothers! You heard the queen! Bring in the royal crib! The royal crib! And so they threw a lavish feast For people high and low And cheerful music never ceased And tables overflowed And all were overjoyed to hear The baby's name was Rose The baby's name was Rose. - Haven't we forgotten something? - All is ready, Your Grace. Have we invited all the neighbours? They have all come, my Lord, from the north and the south. I hope we haven't forgotten to invite your parents, darling. You said hello to them earlier, dear. - Is there enough wine for everyone? - And beer for the people outside. Who was supposed to remind me what this knot should remind me of? - Who was supposed to remind him... - Who was supposed to remind him... It may remind you to buy me high heel shoes. Yes, and for me as well, Your Grace. - I've promised you new shoes? - Yes, to make us look more dignified. I'm not sure... it was not about the wardrobe. Too much on my mind, I guess. I'm the Fairy and I foresee All your days healthy you will be. This good Fairy does foresee All her days healthy she will be. Here I come next, and I foretell, The clouds your beauty will dispel. Well, here I am, the old swamp crone, Comes uninvited, and alone. I will spice up this great feast And add a little curse at least. When little rose comes into bloom, A sharp thorn will her life consume. Guards! Guards! When the summer's in its prime Guards! Hurry up! Death will claim her for all time. You cruel woman! Step aside, The third Godmother, wise and kind Still has a good wish to provide. You cruel woman! Step aside, The third Godmother, wise and kind Still has a good wish to provide. Royal parents, don't be scared The damage still can be repaired She will not die, but has to sleep A hundred years in slumber deep. A hundred years! In a century she may awake If a young man, full of life Can through all the enchantments break And sweet Rose with a kiss revive. Hear, hear, good people, hear and weep By the prick of a little thorn The princess shall be put to sleep And no one will be left to mourn. The greatest care now we will show Everything that's sharp must go Burn it, hide it, throw away To keep the dreadful fate at bay. Cut down everything with thorns, Sharp points, spikes, and even horns Burn it, hide it, throw away To keep the dreadful fate at bay. Fate at bay Blackthorn, bramble, briar rose Anything that's prickly goes - What about gooseberry? - Away with it! Burn it, hide it, throw away Don't move, you crazy - stay! Throw away Rose! One, two, three... Four, five, six... The Princess grew as beautiful As once had been foretold When the sixteen years had passed Cruel fate regained its hold. The princess set out to explore Wishing to set her mind at rest Went up the stairs and through a door And there she met the strangest guest. Good morning, madam, have we met? Don't think I've seen you around here. Good morning, Princess, do not fret. Just watering this flower, dear. Rose! Rose! Have you seen Rose? - What is it called? - It has your name. It once grew all over the land. Its scent puts all others to shame. Why don't you touch it? Ow, my hand! I've won, the game is on! Good people, come and help! The Princess's hand is red with blood. Good people, come and help! The Princess's hand is red with blood. Poor Princess, caught in dreamless sleep, And all the palace followed suit Vines now enshroud the castle steep And thorn bushes have taken root. From rose the princess' name was taken, From prickly thorns she can't awaken. Who will our Princess now defend? Is this the story's start or end? Is this the story's start or end? The comet which appeared that night only comes back once every hundred years. But that's such a long time that none will ever live to see it return. Many wars have raged, many fires have burned. Countless weddings and funerals have passed on the roads. Many times water has flown from streams into the sea, and then wept over the land again. Dear me... I know it seems kind of tedious now, little ones; but it can't be helped. A hundred years is a hundred years. You'll just have to bear with me. Shoo! Get lost! No one has set foot in the enchanted castle for all those years. There were still a few who tried to overcome the ancient curse. But none were able to make their way through. What if a hundred years just passed? He's been saying this all morning. 'What if a hundred years just passed?' - I think we should go and try. - Aren't you running a fever? That Sleeping Beauty won't be awakened. Many noble lords have tried and failed. A stack like this, boys, takes some skill to build. Old Groper from Greenville built one last year, smaller than ours it was, and then he once rode past it with the horses, cracked his whip, and the entire stack went to hell. What do you mean, went to hell? It fell apart. The wood was all over. I see. I have an idea, boys. Listen carefully. Oh my. Another 'interesting test'. I have an interesting test for you. See that cloud up over the barn? - Sure. - Yeah. We do. It may start raining. And we're making hay on the pasture. What would a good farmer do? I know. Hitch up the horses, load up the hay, put it in the loft. Wrong. The hay hasn't dried yet. It's gonna go mouldy in the loft. What would Matt do? Well, the way I look at it, if it gets soaked, we'll just make some more. Wrong. Hay is valuable. We'd be short in winter. What about you, Jack? I'd take a rake and a pitchfork and stack it up. And when it stops raining, I'd spread it again, so it could dry. And would you happen to know where the rake and pitchfork are? In the barn? They should be... But they aren't. You left them by the woods again yesterday. Boys, it's still the same thing with you over and over again. Joe is hot-headed, Matt's indecisive, and Jack never takes care of his things. Shouldn't we go get the hay before it starts raining? And not one of you has realized that this cloud won't rain. I couldn't entrust the farm to any one of you. So, your mother and I, we were thinking that it might help if you went and experienced more of the world. Sure thing! I call dibs on the white. Where are you off to? To swim? We're going to travel the world, Ma. Oh. Well, I'll pack you some cakes and warm clothes. Fall is coming, it's going to bring the chill. Go, see the world, and each of you find yourself a bride. Just make sure she's not afraid of hard work. No prissy missy! With all your flaws, no good girls are going to want you. You'd better mend your ways first. Mend our ways pronto. Sure thing. Good day to you, old woman! What are you doing? Cutting mushrooms. Careful, ma'am. You shouldn't have picked these. They're poisonous. They may come in handy. Well I don't know, but I think you could easily get sick. Shut up, Matt! We're here to find that lost castle. Would you happen to know the way? Oh, many have tried and failed, my lads. And I'm always the last they spoke to. Fortunately. Oh, what am I saying? Unfortunately, I meant to say. But in a hundred years, the princess might wake up, people say. In hundred years exactly. Not sooner, not later. Has someone told you it should happen about now or something? And you don't know when exactly the princess got pricked by that thorn? How would I know? I haven't been up there in a hundred years. What am I saying? I haven't been up there in... ...ever. She doesn't know anything. I think we should just go on. What business would an old crone from the swamp have, being in a castle? Oh, I'm talking nonsense again. I mean, what business would an old lady like me have in a castle? Forget about crone and swamp, I always babble like that. Could she be that old crone from the swamp? What are you mumbling about over there? Speak up so I can hear you. Come on, that one must have been ancient even then. Come on in, let me offer you some refreshment. Well, I sure wouldn't mind... we've been on the road all day. Shut up, Matt. Say, Granny, what's that on your face? Some kind of rash? Oh, that's just moss. Come on in. It must be her. Normal people don't have moss growing on their face. Trees do, though. They always have moss growing on the north side... Shut up. I have potions for everything. Life and death. I keep them separately not to mix them up. I'm a tad forgetful, you know? Just like the sleeping king up there. I'll give you something for life, of course. Come on, bottoms up. It's made of frog slime. Gives strength and beauty. I drink it every day. Well, cheers, Granny. And then we'll be off. And what about you, Granny? Won't you have a drink with us? Oh, I had a dram just before you came. Well, have another one. Oh no, I couldn't do that. I'd be so beautiful you'd start fighting over me! I assure you we wouldn't. I'm sure quick to throw a punch, but I think I'd restrain myself this time. If grandma here is not in the mood for drinking, I wouldn't force her. Shut up, Matt. Down the hatch with it. You'll need all your strength to cut through those bushes. Don't drink that! It's poisoned! What did you just say, young man? I said, drink up, we have to go. Thank you for your hospitality. They'll just ride on for a while, then stick their tongues out and snuff it. Any other time, I would have let the thorns do their work, but these lads have picked a dangerous time to try. Oh dear. We're supposed to cut through this all the way up to that castle? That's right. That's where she's sleeping. Well, I don't know. Here's what I think: how do you know it's been a hundred years exactly, Jack? And how do you know it hasn't? Brothers should stick together. Let's get to it. You two keep working. I'll be right back. That which isn't in the head has to be in the legs, my boy. - Back already? - I forgot my sword. You know where it was? In the manger. That's where you put feed, not weapons. Cattle don't eat weapons. Thanks. Feed in the manger, sword in the scabbard. No weapons in the manger, cattle don't eat weapons. There were once three brothers Sounds like us Who quarrelled like no others Sounds like us People whisper all around And it appears That the lost girl might be found In a hundred years And so we started arguing When is that? Last year, tomorrow? That's the thing When is that? So? How d'it go? Those horrible bushes Won't be beaten New thorns just keep growing And you'll get eaten Those horrible bushes They trap you in And prickle and choke you You can't win I feel it is too late We've missed the proper time. I think it was too early Now let's go get some wine. It is too late. It is too early. You are a fool! Don't be so surly! There is no use in chasing girls, Too much struggle and lot of nerves. There is no use in chasing girls, It's for those who have some nerves. - Well, we tried to get to that castle. - You haven't had much success, I reckon. - You reckon well, father. - What did I tell you? - That we wouldn't have much success. - Oh my, you look a fright. Good that we're home. I don't know about your father, but I was kind of imagining this traveling the world would take you a bit longer. So did I. I thought you'd come back with the first snow. And with the brides. We tried to get one, but she's impossible to reach. Don't drink so fast, Joe. A noble bride would be no good for you. She could not milk the cows or turn hay. You need girls who are not afraid of hard work. Finding the right one takes time. And patience. Well, let's say this has just been a warm-up... ...and tomorrow, they're gonna go for real. What do you say, Matt? Matt! Don't sleep here! I dreamt about the woods again. Such a nice dream. Father says this has been just a warm-up. There was this doe with a little fawn. You're going to set off to find some brides tomorrow. "Good day, gamekeeper, would you show us where the manger is?" they asked me. I guess they were hungry, poor things. And you, Jack, forget about that castle. It was sheer madness to try. I see you sleeping, pretty lass As I was told I want my dream to come to pass Have you to hold. I know the way but not the time But I will go I'll set you free and make you mine I love you so. Not too early, not too late I'll brave those weeds at any date. When Cupid's arrows pierce your heart You have no choice but to do your part. Do your part I'll fight those thorny thickets Yet again And tell you my life story There and then. And when your eyes meet mine In the tower there I'll twine a red red rose through your shining hair. He'll twine a red red rose Through her shining hair. Where does firelock goes? On my belt. This young man bravely comes to fight The maze of thorns each day and night But with each inch of ground he wins New brambles tear at poor Jack's skin. Where is the firelock? On my belt. Am I good or what? Feed in the manger, sword in the scabbard. I come to this hillside every day And fight the thick bushes to make a way My sword has gone dull My strength all but gone. Torn by briars Pricked by thorns Six days he fights The seventh dawns He lifts his axe The seventh day The thorns don't fight But melt away! No! Not a happy ending! This was the right day, so it seems The princess wakens from her dreams. This was the right day, so it seems The princess wakens from her dreams. What a lovely way to wake How blissful I feel. It must be I'm just dreaming... Excuse me... Such beauty can't be real! Your hands are scratched and grazed Is it from your ride? Oh, that's what happens these days When you seek a bride. My collar! I got stuck! You idiot! What a lovely way to wake my heart that slept the longest time In dreams I saw a wedding day And wished so hard the groom was mine. I will be yours, my flower Yours by all that's true, Love has conquered evil A wedding is now due. He will be yours, sweet flower Yours by all that's true, Love has conquered evil A wedding is now due. What a lovely way to wake How blissful I feel. It must be I'm just dreaming, Such beauty can't be real! Love has conquered evil A wedding is now due What about that one? I think I'll take this one. Bring it on. Turn around. Show me your teeth... - Hands off! She's mine. - I was here first! And here our story ends For you and all your friends You've watched the tale unfurl Of a gentle girl. Her beauty shone clear as a flame A rose she was in truth and name A rose she was in truth and name. To make me stronger... not to poison myself. I must look in this section only... this one will do! Now I'll show you! Just wait! For his perseverance in love and stopped losing his things, brother Jack married Rose and became a king. But his brother, Matt, favoured a different kingdom: his beloved forest. He was kept quite busy, since there hadn't been a gamekeeper for a long time. Hello. Gamekeeper, where can we find the new manger? Past the larch tree and to the left. Thanks! We've been looking for an hour. Come one, Davie. I wonder if the wolf will come along too. But I don't reckon he will. There are no wolves in these woods, you pigeon. There is so one! I told him, you are not supposed to be in these woods, wolf. Well, that's news to me. There were foxes around, but a wolf? He's got a secret hideout. And his belly's huge. Said he'd eaten a deer, antlers and all! That's him! That's him! Wolf! It's the wolf! It's my brother. - Where are you off to, Joe? - I'm going to find myself a bride! - What's the rush? - Oh, it's in his nature. Hey! I just can't wait to find a bride And say my wedding vows She should be pretty and bright-eyed And must be good with cows. Hey, girls! I'm looking for a wife. Which of you is the prettiest? Turn around and let me see. We're busy here. Come see for yourself. You I like. No boyfriend yet? What business is that of yours? Well I wouldn't mind marrying her. Wow, high-speed courtship. That's a first. You must go down on one knee to ask for a girl's hand! I see. I have a pretty decent farm. - What you don't have are decent manners. - You're not buying a goat! Go bother someone else, psycho! With her my life would be a song Completely trouble-free She'd tend the horses all day long And then she'd tend to me. She'd help me work the farm all day She'd smell like wheat and summer hay. I am the first who will admit I can be somewhat hot-headed, But if I found my Mrs. Right She'd help me keep my temper light. But if I found my Mrs. Right She'd help me keep my temper light. Good day, bright wood Good day, small birds. The morning is Too good for words. The whole world sings So loud and true. Spider webs shine With morning dew. Little lass, good day, What do they call you? Don't go astray, No one will save you. I like to dress as bright as flame and so Red Riding Hood's my name. It is her name. Red Riding Hood, A pretty name they gave you. Don't go astray, No one will save you. Why would they say "Don't go astray?" I take this path, not any other Whenever I go with my mother. Poor girl had to have her way And went on with no doubt. The big bad wolf has sensed his prey And now he's coming out. What a plucky girl you are Yeah, yeah, yeah To venture all alone so far Yeah, yeah, yeah Oh, poor thing – you're just a stray! Here's a sausage; eat it right away. Eat it right away. Eat it right away. Eat it right away. Oh thank you, much obliged In fact, I wouldn't mind Seeing what other fare Is in that basket there. This basket over here Is for my Granny dear So move your ugly snout Or she'll be much put out. There is some nice wine Red like this cape of mine And fish with caraway For my Granny's birthday. And where is your Granny's house? East or West? North or South? Coo, yoooo down there, you furry tyke, I see you well, so take a hike! Who is calling? What is this? Just the rustling of the leaves. Coo, coo, the wolf is near! You'd better run away from here! Did someone say the wolf is near? Just wind in the thickets, do not fear. Now tell me, where's your Granny's home? That poor old lady, all alone... Over the hill By the big spruce A little house With cozy rooms And now I'm off And now I'm off. The trusting girl is well along her way. The cunning wolf hurries There'll be some foul play. Stupid pigeon I may be But I will get that wolf, you'll see Stupid I may be, maybe But I'll get him, you'll see You'll see This basket over here Is for my Granny dear Stupid pigeon I may be But I will get that wolf, you'll see Stupid I may be, maybe But I'll get him, you'll see You'll see I have heard from a bird The wolf is out and about To cause some trouble, There's no doubt. With ready gun and steady tread I'm off to find the girl in red. With ready gun and steady tread He's off to find the girl in red. Good morning, Granny dear Here's Red Riding Hood I've come to cheer you up today And brought you something good. Thanks, o granddaughter of mine, I'd like a good swig of that wine. Oh Granny, what big eyes you have! The better to see you with, my dear. And what big ears, Granny, you have! The better to hear you, loud and clear. Deer jumps, come on! You're a deer! Oh Granny, have you grown a beard? It helps to keep me warm, my dear. ...but I will get that wolf, you'll see Oh Granny, what a big mouth you have! You don't say, you stupid girl... The better to eat you with! I hear there's a girl that needs rescuing I promise I'm on it, but nothing doing Stop, biddy! Oh, stop, you beast! You can't dupe me! I say stop! So I don't know... I say stop and it lays down. He feels bloated. I hear there's a girl that needs rescuing I promise I'm on it, but nothing doing Be quiet, my animals dear So I can check it, so I can hear. Let's all be quiet so he can hear. Here we are! Here inside! It's in here what he ate! Let's hope it's not too late. I know just what to do: I'll slice his belly through! Watch out you in there! She's back, alive and whole Who else comes through the hole? Her Granny, scared but fine Come on, Grandma, rise and shine. Stupid pigeon I may be But I did get that wolf, you see. All that remains is to decide Whether to shoot his sorry hide. That is the question! So, children, who thinks we should leave the wolf alive? Well, that's not a whole lot. And if he promised to mend his ways? Would you spare him? Here's what I think. If I shoot him now, he definitely won't be able to mend anything. So, what if we left the decision up to the one who got stuck in the wolf's throat? What do you say, Granny? I'll see, just let him loose If he can be put to use. She'll see, just let me loose, If I can be put to use. Keep him here to guard the house Watch for thieves and all such louts. I'll stay guard the house Watch for thieves and all such louts. I'll make him a nice bed of straw As long as he sits and gives a paw. For a comfy bed of straw I'll gladly sit and give a paw. For a comfy bed of straw He'll gladly sit and give a paw. Little Red Riding Hood Is that what they call you? All the long day I think about you. When you've had time to grow When you are in your prime I'd like to be your beau I'd like to make you mine. I like to dress as bright as flame And so Red Riding Hood's my name. As bright as flame, as bright as flame And so Red Riding Hood's my name. After this somewhat disastrous celebration of Granny's birthday, Matt walked Red Riding Hood back home to her parents... and asked them to save him the position of groom in the future. A lawyer would say they made a preliminary contract. You don't mind the age difference? - Not really, Mr. Hood. - Hi, Mummy. Before you daughter reaches marrying age I'll use the time to mature too. As you know, we boys mature later. You got that right. Look at her, here you can see exactly what our little girls are going to look like one day. I see. That's all right, I guess. So I wouldn't take too long to grow up if I were you. You're also lucky she doesn't take after her father. In beauty, I mean. I see. That is lucky, I guess. - What did you say? - That he's a lucky boy. - Can I kiss him goodbye? - Papa? She could give him a kid's kiss, I guess. My handsome huntsman, wait a while I'll be your wife and make you smile. Ciao! She liked to dress as bright as flame And Red Riding Hood was her name. How would she be called? As bright as flame, as bright as flame And Red Riding Hood was her name. Well, that's that. Enough of red colour. We enjoyed it galore. So far, things are going well, right? Brother Jack has married Princess Rose, brother Matt has reserved himself a bride, but what about Joe, you may ask? I would like to know that myself. Winter's coming and he's God knows where. Look, mother! A carriage. - You are His Majesty's parents, right? - Yeah, that would be us. - Yeah, that would be us. - His Majesty sends his regards... Come on over, so we don't have to shout. His Majesty sends his regards and bade me tell you to leave the farm and come live with him in the palace. Now that he's king there's no need for you to work yourselves to death. Well, he's got a point. So, grab that basket and tip it out on that cart over there. Live in the palace... and what exactly would we be doing there? Nothing, that's the point. Did you hear that, mother? Nothing, he says. And who's going to tend the fields, and mind the cattle? Let the fields lie fallow; sell the cattle. - That's what our son wants us to do? - Yes, that's what His Majesty said. Let the fields lie, he said. No sowing, no planting? You'll sleep on the softest feather beds, servants will bring you breakfast in bed. Good God! Imagine the mess! All those crumbs, and coffee stains on the sheets! - You may again! - I beg your pardon? It's full again. Oh, that's just our Pa's fingers! I thought my spine's just cracked. I thought it was my spine that cracked. Our Joe brings home a bride soon, and before he'll take over we'll not sit on a bench. And tell Jack and Rosie to stop by sometime. We're going to have a new calf! - I'm sure glad they came. - It's nice to hear our boy thinks about us. No. It's nice they helped with the potatoes. I just hope Joe actually does find a bride. He's so rash and hot-headed. There's someone out there for everyone. Even the right one to cool that hot head of his. I just can't wait to find a bride And say my wedding vows She should be pretty and bright-eyed And must be good with cows. With her my life would be a song Completely trouble-free She'd tend the horses all day long And then she'd tend to me. She'd help me work the farm all day She'd smell like wheat and summer hay. I am the first who will admit I can be somewhat hot-headed, But if I found my Mrs. Right She'd help me keep my temper light. Not so quickly, you know. My horse is thirsty. You have to wait a moment for the bucket to fill up. - Now? - Not yet... Now. - Allow me? - No, wait... You're so good with this. And you're a bit of an oaf, aren't you? - Let me help you. - I think I'd better do it myself. You probably think I'm a complete klutz, but I can do my share of work, you know. One tale ended, here's another. Hear the story of a mother Who's not too happy, people say With pretty Mary in her way. Sweet Helen, she takes after me One day this house hers will be. My stepdaughter Mary, though... She's much too pretty; she must go. If ever a young man comes to woo And Mary here comes into view He'll swoon and take her for his own And poor Helen will be left alone. Well don't just stand there; make me a cup And then it's time to milk the cow. Do as I say and then clean up And maybe then you'll get some chow. Some stale bread, that's just the stuff She's young and strong, she can make do. And if she cleans up well enough She might just get some water too. My little cow, my little cow, Stand still and calm, I'll milk you now. Oh, I'm so glad to have you near It seems that no one likes me here. Your eyes are windows to your soul You look at me as if you know Warm up your Mary, she's so cold I'll give your horns a pretty bow. I see you're done with everything How boring that must be for you. You're lucky I have just the thing: Here's what I order you to do. Go to the forest, find and gather Some violets for me and mother. Are you joking, sister mine. Violets now? It's wintertime! Go find those flowers, we say! If you don't get them you will pay! The snow has covered all the land The wind is howling far and wide. Such chill the moon cannot withstand And slips behind the clouds to hide. No one's out this frosty night All creatures to their homes have gone. I alone the chill must fight My sister has a heart of stone. Chop-chop! Here. Is there a chance there could be found A girl just to my taste? She carries a white can around And has such a slim waist... I met her yonder by the well I came to get my horse a drink. Right there I fell under her spell I cannot of another think. You must mean this daughter mine With eyes so pretty that they shine. Come to think of it once more I must have knocked on the wrong door. I must have knocked... on the wrong door. We are time In its prime Growing trees Bloom and freeze We are time In its prime One whole year Don't come near. My good men, peace be with you I didn't mean to disturb you. It's just I'm tired through and through My hands are cold and frozen blue. Even in these chilly hours I've been sent to gather flowers. Through cruel winter I must roam Until with violets I come home. Our brother third Your plea has heard. Our brother third Your plea has heard. For her pure heart Let the spring start. For her pure heart Let the spring start. Thank you. Thank you so much! My Goodness me, She has the flowers. How has this happened? Evil powers? You have been gone for hours; Where did you find those flowers? There in the woods, down by the creek. Under the shrubs I went to seek. You think you're pretty smart, do you? Let's give you something more to do. Even in the deepest snow Some strawberries are bound to grow. So go and pick some for us, now! You are so clever, mother. Wow! You must be joking, mother mine. Strawberries, now? It's wintertime! Find those berries now, we say! You don't get them, you will pay! The snow has covered all the land The wind is getting out of hand, It's hidden all the trails And now it laughs and wails. It's hidden all the trails And now it laughs and wails. No one's out this frosty day All creatures to their homes have gone. I alone the chill must brave My mother has a heart of stone. Is there a chance there could be found A girl just to my taste? She carries a white can around And has such a slim waist... I met her yonder by the well I came to get my horse a drink. Right there I fell under her spell I cannot of another think. You must mean my daughter here. She sews and cooks and cleans, the dear. Come to think of it once more I must have knocked on the wrong door. I must have knocked... on the wrong door. Get in position! Someone's coming. Head count! - January: present and correct. - February right here! March here. - Where in the blazes is April? - I'm right here! I had to take a leak. - Can't he just hold it? - It was just a light shower... Enough! A little dignity, please. We are time! We are time In its prime Growing trees Bloom and freeze We are time In its prime Why are you near? You've just been here! Speak up! My kind sirs, I have been told To pick some berries, but it's cold. Some strawberries I have to find Or stepmother will have my hide. Oh kind sirs, she has been told To pick some berries, but it's cold. Some strawberries she has to find Or stepmother will have her hide. Sad and harsh is this girl's lot. Brother June, give it a shot. Sad and harsh is this girl's lot. Brother June, give it a shot. For her pure heart Let summer start. For her pure heart Let summer start. Thank you! My Goodness me, She has the berries. Where did she get them, From the fairies? Where did you find them, sister dear? Did you go far, or was it near? Under the snowdrift over there. My fingers are the worse for wear. Well if you think you are so smart Go get some apples, not too tart. Make sure you bring enough for two. An apple would be nice, that's true. You must be joking, mother mine. Get apples now? It's wintertime! Find those apples now, we say! You don't get them, you will pay! So long, old woman. It had to be strong fascination when such a hothead attempted to find Mary twice. Simply doesn't have more patience. What a pity! We are time In its prime She's here again! What is it then? Kind gentlemen, here is the thing: Some apples I was told to bring. Sad and harsh is this girl's lot. Brother September, give it a shot. Got it! Well, here she brings The apples back. But why so few? Did you stop and snack? Admit you ate them, cores and all! I can't believe you had the gall! September lasted just a while, I couldn't bring more, try a smile. Oh mother dear, let's go alone We'll bring a basketful back home. Those apples are so fresh and sweet Let's go and get the fruity treat! The snow has covered all the land The wind is howling far and wide. No one would venture out tonight Those two were foolish to have tried. No one would venture out tonight Those two were foolish to have tried. - I can't believe this! - What? Someone's coming again! Two someones actually. Word must have gotten around or something. What if we let April snuff out the fire? Just a little shower... they wouldn't find us. Well, yeah. No snuffing. If they're good people, we help them. And all of you, behave! Here they are Young and old Rather bold Why are you out in this cold? Mind your own business, you old dolts. Or ice will surely clog your throats. Their hearts are cold Their manners nought January, now you ought To raise a mighty storm They won't again be warm. We are time One whole year Don't come near... My little cow, my little cow, Stand still and calm, I'll milk you now. I've been left all alone somehow So now we're here, and you are mine. My family has disappeared I won't complain, but it sure is weird. So now it's left to you and me To keep each other company. So now it's left to you and me to keep each other company. Oh dear, oh dear! Is someone here? There's someone at the gate! Could it be stepmother and Helen? Who wants them back? No one, apparently. Can't be Joe. He's not patient enough to come back the third time... Or is he? Who thinks it could be Joe? - Is there a chance there could be found... - Wow, you must all have second sight! She carries a white can around And has such a slim waist... She's here! She's me! - She's here? - She is! I am a good, hard-working lad, I can assure you I'm no cad. You seem so sweet and pretty hot What do you say we tie the knot? I noticed you before, I think When you brought your horse to drink. And if you're looking for a spouse Together we could keep a house. - We could. - Together we could keep a house. And this is where our story ends Of men and women, foes and friends Of the twelve months that make a year And how new hope can swift appear. Of a girl whose life was sad And little joy and love she had And all the things she had to do Before she found her lover true. Here they come! Stories give us great delight Clear like a mountain spring So take a deep breath and sit tight And feel the joy they bring. What a lovely ending... Now say your wows and kneel. - I do! - I do! - It must be I'm still dreaming. - Such beauty can't be real. - Believe in stories, they are fair - And have a happy ending. - Without them we would all despair - Our troubles never ending. What a lovely morning What a joy to feel It must be I'm still dreaming. Such beauty can't be real. Papa... Mom... Pa! All our boys overcame their weaknesses. Can't you stop your terrible cracking too? But Ma, that's no weakness. Just a completely harmless bad habit. Stories give us great delight Clear like a mountain spring So take a deep breath and sit tight And feel the joy they bring. Now don't move for an hour... ...so you are not smudgy! There were once three brothers Sounds like us Who quarrelled like no others Sounds like us People whisper all around And it appears That the lost girl might be found In a hundred years And so we started arguing When is that? Last year, tomorrow? That's the thing When is that? Those horrible bushes Won't be beaten New thorns just keep growing And you'll get eaten Those horrible bushes They trap you in And prickle and choke you You can't win I feel it is too late We've missed the proper time. I think it was too early Now let's go get some wine. It is too late. It is too early. You are a fool! Don't be so surly! There is no use in chasing girls, Too much struggle and lot of nerves. There is no use in chasing girls, It's for those who have some nerves.
