YEAH, THAT'S SO. IS THERE SOMETHING THAT YOU'D LIKE TO SAY NOW THAT I'VE REMINDED YOU OF YOUR MANNERS? YEAH. CAN I BORROW A MATCH? IF IT AIN'T INJUNS STEALING MY HORSES, IT'S SOME NO-GOOD STEALING MY CANNED GOODS! YOU SAID THERE WERE TWO OF THEM? THAT'S RIGHT. HOW OLD? 20 OR SO. THEM IN THE WAGON WEREN'T. THERE WAS FIVE OLD MEN. I SAW THEM WHEN THEY RODE OFF. LOOKS LIKE JOHN HENRY BROUGHT ALONG SOME YOUNG GUNS. WHICH WAY WERE THEY HEADED? SOUTH. MUCH OBLIGED. YOU MIND MY ASKING WHY YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THEM? THEY STOLE FROM A BANK IN DEL RIO. WELL, AT LEAST I AIN'T THE ONLY ONE AROUND HERE GETTING ROBBED. GOOD LUCK TO YOU! THANK YOU. ♪ IT'S A SHAME YOU BOYS DON'T KNOW MORE ABOUT YOUR TRADE THAN YOU DO. YOU'D WENT OUT AND FOUND YOUR OLD BANK TO ROB. THAT WAY, YOU WOULDN'T BE IN SO MUCH TROUBLE. SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU'RE THE ONES IN TROUBLE. WELL, IF YOU CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY TO DO IT WE ARE. DO WHAT? KILL US. YOU THINK WE'D DO THAT? WELL YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE. THING ABOUT IT IS, WHEN YOU DO GET RID OF US YOU'VE GOTTA MAKE SURE IT LOOKS LIKE THE GOLD GETS LOST TOO, OR ELSE THEY'LL FIND US DEAD, THE GOLD GONE, AND THEY'LL COME RIGHT AFTER YOU. THIS TIME THEY WON'T BE COMING AFTER YOU FOR STEALING. THIS TIME THEY'LL BE COMING AT YOU FOR KILLING. MAN DON'T KNOW THE ROPES IN THIS BUSINESS, HE'S LIABLE TO WIND UP WITH ONE AROUND HIS NECK. WELL WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IF I TOLD YOU I ALREADY GOT THAT WORKED OUT? I'D HAVE TO DOUBT IT. EVER SINCE YOU GUYS JUMPED US BACK THERE, I'VE BEEN WRACKING MY BRAIN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I WOULD DO ABOUT IT IF THE SITUATION WERE TURNED AROUND. I HAVEN'T COME UP WITH ANYTHING YET. WELL, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A MAN GETS A LONG WAY DOWN THE ROAD. HIS MIND DON'T WORK AS GOOD AS IT USED TO. SOME WAYS IT DON'T. SOME WAYS IT DOES. TAKE RIGHT NOW FOR INSTANCE. I CAN TELL YOU WHAT YOU BOYS ARE THINKING. YOU'RE THINKING YOU WISH YOU HAD ANOTHER WAY OUT OF THIS. BECAUSE DEEP DOWN, YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO SPEND THE REST OF YOUR LIFE KNOWING THAT YOU KILLED FIVE MEN. FIVE OLD MEN. MAKES A DIFFERENCE. YOU MEAN KIND OF LIKE PUTTING US OUT OF OUR MISERY LIKE THE NO-GOODS THAT WE ARE? WELL, YOU COULD SAY THAT, YEAH. COURSE YOU GOTTA GET IT DONE FIRST. THAT MIGHT NOT BE SO EASY. WELL, YOU SAID THAT LIKE YOU WERE PLANNING ON STOPPING US. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IF I TOLD YOU THAT I ALREADY HAD THAT FIGURED OUT? I'D HAVE TO DOUBT IT. FIGURED YOU WOULD. YOUR HIDE. SEEMS TO ME WE SHOULD'VE CAUGHT UP WITH THE CAPTAIN AND GEORGE RIGHT NOW. WE'LL BE LUCKY TO CATCH UP ON THE WALL, THANKS TO YOU. WASN'T MY FAULT I HAD A FLAT! YOU'LL GET MORE THAN THAT IF THE CAPTAIN RUNS INTO TROUBLE AND WE AIN'T THERE TO HELP HIM. HOLD IT? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? PUTTING ON MY NIGHT WATCHMAN GLASSES. I THINK I SEE SOMETHING. [CHUCKLING] JUST AS I THOUGHT. THERE'S A TOWN UP AHEAD. THAT TOWN UP AHEAD HAS BEEN THERE FOR THE LAST HALF HOUR. IT HAS? JASON FITCH, YOU ARE THE WORST TRACKER I EVER DID SEE. I MEAN, YOU DON'T HEAR GOOD, YOU'VE GOT NO SENSE OF DIRECTION, YOU'RE BLIND AS A BAT. IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME IF YOU HANG UPSIDE DOWN WHEN YOU SLEEP! WANT ME TO GET DOWN AND WALK? NO I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET DOWN AND WALK. YOU'LL GET LOST. HOLD ON. YOU DON'T SUPPOSE JOHN HENRY GOT HIMSELF CAUGHT NOW, DO YOU? HUH. COULD BE. HELLO, THE SALOON. THIS IS CAPTAIN HAYES, TEXAS RANGERS. [GLASS SHATTERING] [GUNSHOTS] HOW MANY OF THEM ARE THERE? ONLY SAW TWO. GOTTA BE MORE THAN THAT. THOSE BOYS ARE KIND OF TOUCHY, AIN'T THEY? CAPTAIN, WHAT'S GOING ON? SOUNDS LIKE YOU STARTED A WAR! WE DID. BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHICH SIDE WE'RE ON. IT AIN'T HOW MANY THAT YOU'RE UP AGAINST YOU GOTTA WORRY ABOUT, YOU KNOW. IT'S WHO THEY ARE. THAT'S CAPTAIN HAYES AND HIS BOYS OUT THERE. BOYS? THEY LOOK LIKE A COUPLE OLD GOATS TO ME. OLD OR NO, YOU'VE GOT YOUR WORK CUT OUT FOR YOU IF YOU'RE PLANNING ON GETTING SAFE AWAY WITH THAT GOLD. SHUT UP! WHY DON'T YOU JUST TAKE THE REWARD MONEY AND LET IT GO AT THAT? LOOK OLD MAN, I SET OUT TO SPEND THAT GOLD AND THAT'S WHAT I FULL INTEND TO DO. WHAT A MAN INTENDS AND WHAT HE DOES IS SOMETIMES DIFFERENT. WHAT A MAN INTENDS AND WHAT HE DOES IS SOMETIMES I INTENDED TO ROB A TEXAS TRAIN. FOR 20 YEARS I INTENDED THAT, AND I DIDN'T GET IT DONE. AND THIS... THIS DYNAMITE. THAT'S ANOTHER THING I INTENDED TO DO. IS TO BLOW YOU BOYS UP. BUT I DIDN'T. WELL, I GOT TO THINKING. IT AIN'T RIGHT. YOU'RE YOUNG AND YOU'VE GOT YOUR WHOLE LIFE IN FRONT OF YOU. IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET ON MY GOOD SIDE, FORGET IT. I DON'T HAVE ONE. ALL I'M SAYING IS YOU'VE GOT TO LEARN TO PUT UP WITH LIFE'S DISAPPOINTMENTS. I KNOW IT'S HARD, BUT YOU'VE GOT TO LEARN TO DO IT. QUIT PREACHING. WHY DON'T YOU JUST TOSS ME THAT STICK, NICE AND GENTLE? WHY DON'T YOU COME AND GET IT? YOU'RE NOT AFRAID OF AN OLD MAN, ARE YOU? 'COURSE, I DON'T BLAME YOU IF YOU ARE. IT'S LIKE YOU SAID: A MAN GETS ON DOWN THE ROAD, SOMETIMES HIS MIND DON'T WORK AS GOOD AS IT USED TO. YOU MAKE A WRONG MOVE, I'M LIABLE TO PANIC, THROW THIS STICK OF DYNAMITE IN THE STOVE HERE. YOU'RE BLUFFING. THERE'S ONE WAY TO FIND OUT. I THINK HE MEANS IT, COTTON. I KNOW I MEAN IT. YOU SEE, I DON'T HAVE A GOOD SIDE EITHER. NOW WHY DON'T YOU BOYS THROW YOUR WINCHESTERS DOWN OVER THERE AND GET OUT OF THE DOOR, AND ME AND MY FRIENDS WILL WALK ON OUT OF HERE. SUIT YOURSELF. [GUNS COCKING] HOLD IT! DO LIKE HE SAYS. WELL IF YOU DON'T MIND, WE'LL JUST LEAVE THE GOLD OVER THERE. LEAVE IT? YEAH, THAT WAY I KNOW YOU BOYS'LL BE HERE FOR THE FIGHT. THE FIGHT? WE'LL LEAVE YOUR GUNS IN THE WAGON OUT THERE. THAT WAY IT WILL BE FAIR. YOU MEAN YOU WANT TO HAVE A SHOOTOUT? THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S KIND OF OLD FASHIONED, AIN'T IT? WELL IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU LOOK AT IT. WELL, THE WAY I LOOK ON IT IS YOU GOT THE DROP ON US. WHY DON'T YOU TAKE THE GOLD AND GO? IF WE DO THAT, YOU'LL JUST COME AFTER US AND JUMP US AGAIN. THIS WAY IT'LL ALL BE OVER, ONCE AND FOR GOOD. WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT GETTING KILLED? I DON'T PLAN TO. NO? WELL THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, YOU AND THESE OLD MEN WALK OUT AGAINST US. WELL THEN YOU AIN'T GOT NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT, DO YOU? EXCEPT FOR THOSE WHO'LL BE COMING AFTER YOU. KIND OF A HIGH PRICE TO PAY TO GET US TO THE END OF A ROPE. WE AIN'T PAID IT YET. SHOULD WARN YOU, IT'LL PROBABLY BE HARD TO KEEP CAPTAIN HAYES AND HIS BOYS OUT OF THIS. THERE'S NOTHING THEY LIKE BETTER THAN A GOOD FIGHT. IT AIN'T EVERY DAY THEY GET TO BE ON YOUR SIDE. WELL, I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. IT COULD BE A PROBLEM. WELL YOU'D BETTER WORK IT OUT. YOU'RE GOING TO NEED ALL THE HELP YOU CAN GET. OH, BY THE WAY. IF IT'S ALRIGHT, WE'LL JUST WAIT TIL MORNING TO LEAVE YOUR GUNS IN THE WAGON. ME AND THE BOYS, WE DON'T SEE TOO GOOD IN THE DARK ANYMORE. COME TOMORROW, YOU WON'T SEE AT ALL. WE'LL SEE. I DON'T CARE IF YOU SWEAR UP AND DOWN ON A STACK OF BIBLES, I DON'T BELIEVE YOU. I TRUSTED YOU ONCE, I AIN'T GONNA DO IT AGAIN. I DON'T BLAME YOU, BUT I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH THIS TIME. WE'S GONNA TAKE THAT GOLD BACK TO DEL RIO. CHARLIE, CHARLIE'LL TELL YOU. YOU KNOW CHARLIE DON'T LIE. ALL I KNOW IS YOU AIN'T GOING TO CROSS ME AGAIN. I'M GOING TO SEE TO IT THEY PUT YOU BACK IN THAT CELL AND THROW AWAY THE KEY! AND LET THOSE FOUR NO-GOODS OVER THERE GO FREE? THEY HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING. THEY THREW DOWN ON YOU. THEY'RE JUST TRIGGER-HAPPY, THAT'S ALL. THEY WANT THE GOLD FOR THEMSELVES. THEY WERE GOING TO KILL US TO GET IT, AND THEY'LL DO THE SAME THING TO YOU IF YOU GIVE THEM A CHANCE. WELL THEY AIN'T GONNA GET THAT CHANCE. WE'RE MOVING OUT OF HERE, NOW. AND GIVE THEM THE 20,000? WELL, YOU GAVE IT TO 'EM! AND I CAN GET IT BACK, BUT THAT AIN'T GONNA CHANGE NOTHING. ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, WE'VE GOTTA FIGHT THEM BOYS OVER THERE, AND IF WE HEAD OUT TO DEL RIO, THEY'LL HAVE US JUST WHERE THEY WANT US. THEY HAVEN'T GOT ANY GUNS! THEY CAN GET GUNS. THEY'VE GOT FOUR DAYS. HE'S RIGHT, CAPTAIN. HE'S NEVER BEEN RIGHT IN HIS LIFE! WELL I AM NOW, AND IF YOU WASN'T TOO BULL HEADED TO ADMIT IT, ALL YOU WANT TO DO IS SEND ME BACK TO PRISON! LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, IF THE BOYS CATCH US IN THE OPEN OUT THERE, MORE THAN YOUR PRIDE IS GOING TO GET HURT. WE'RE HEADING OUT FOR DEL RIO. CAPTAIN... WE'RE GOING TO DO IT MY WAY. WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU WALKED OUT AGAINST A MAN IN A GUNFIGHT, JOHN HENRY? IT WAS AGAINST NASH HERE, WASN'T IT? AND HE KNOCKED YOU DOWN. HE'S GOOD. NOT ANYMORE HE'S NOT. AND THAT GOES FOR ALL OF US. IT'S A LITTLE LATE TO START FEELING SORRY FOR OURSELVES, DON'T YOU THINK? IT'S A LITTLE LATE FOR A LOT OF THINGS. AND STANDING UP TO THOSE BOYS IN THE STREET IS ONE OF THEM. WE WOULDN'T HAVE A CHANCE. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE WOULD HAVE, CAPTAIN. GO OUT IN A BLAZE OF GLORY, IS THAT IT? WHY NOT? IT AIN'T EVERY DAY A MAN GETS TO DIE DOING WHAT HE DOES. YOU COULD BE WRONG ABOUT US, CAPTAIN. WHEN PUSH COMES TO SHOVE, WE JUST MIGHT BE ABLE TO TAKE THOSE BOYS. I ALWAYS WAS BETTER AT GUNFIGHTING THAN RUNNING. COME ON CAPTAIN, WHAT DO YOU SAY? THEY'RE AWFUL YOUNG. AND EVERY ONE OF THEM WOULD SHOOT A MAN JUST TO SEE HIM FALL.
