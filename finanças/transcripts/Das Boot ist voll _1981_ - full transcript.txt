Stop it! You'll only make the bastards more angry. THE BOAT IS FULL This would make a good wine cellar. The Krauts would drink it up from their side. Now all we need is to wall off the Gotthard. Are you crazy? What about the Nazi trains with wounded that come through Switzerland? For my part, they can bring those every day... even dead ones! That's enough! Shut up! Provided they really have no legs. They might just suddenly stop and shoot us in the back. Shut up. Have you heard this one? The difference between a Jew and a pork sausage? I hope he won't come through here! What's the matter? I'll see what's wrong. Come on! My wife! My wife! Where's Karl? Where? Up front! On the locomotive! Come and take a look. Your partisans are terrifying! Do you prefer head first or feet first? No! Please! Please. It's for the vegetables. - We'll leave before dark. - What? How'd you get the key? The children were so hungry. You should have asked! This is Switzerland, isn't it? For the time being. Come, I don't like people in my barn. No point sitting in the dark. Do you all understand German? If you speak like that, yes. Allow me to introduce myself. Ostrowskij. Actually, I live in Vienna. How many of you are there? We're waiting for darkness before moving on. Jesus! Here's a Nazi! I must report that, or I'll get blamed. He's crawling with them. You want us all to have lice? Is he yours? I don't know... Somebody brought him to the locomotive at the last moment. How come? We simply took him with us. Excuse me, I think he only speaks French. Close your eyes. Your eyes. Close them! It hurts! Is it broken? No, no... Shouldn't it be treated? Perhaps they won't take my brother if he can't work. Franz... you're back? Everyone is working right now and the others are in the army. We don't want to see that any more! Wait... Even eggs are rationed now. One per person. I'll just get my things... Is that your fiancée? Where is she now? Just from a newspaper. Not the knife. Give it to me! - I may need it. - Exactly. Is anybody home? Isn't it dangerous here? Set the table, meanwhile. Hello, Anni. Hello, Rosemarie. Well? Three beers. Here are some empty bottles. I see some people can still afford to eat breakfast at an inn! Or are those relatives in your kitchen? By the way, have you seen our kitten? I'm wondering. I'm just fixing her for lunch. Cats aren't rationed yet. Some people would do that. Come on, Otti... get moving! Unload! Build up your chest muscles. Did you get new help, Otti? Who's so thirsty at your house? Wasn't Ruedi drafted? It's only me. We've already started. Aren't you thirsty? You see, Gitty, I told you there would be a miracle. We might have lasted another day and a half. Every morning... we shared one sugar cube... and another in the afternoon... when it was at its worst. Meat is really forbidden today. Every other day. But if you eat quickly... Please don't go to such trouble. Jesus! You shouldn't be eating pork! Maybe it will work out, somehow. Why? Grandpa, may I write to Stephanie that we're here? We may not really be here yet. But the lady said... Come and choose a postcard. Excuse me. Look, this one even shows our house. Is there a telephone? You already know someone in Switzerland? Where did you get this address? I don't think you can call there. Why? Don't you know it's a prison? No... but my husband is there. He escaped from a German work camp into Switzerland. Here's his last letter. I haven't seen him in two years. Is it far? Could I get there today? It's not forbidden here, is it? If I'm Jewish and he's not. Wait... it's better to ask in Swiss dialect. - What's your husband's name? - Krüger, Hannes Krüger. This is Mill Restaurant. Do you have a Krüger there? Must be a refugee. His wife is looking for him. Writing takes too long. She hasn't seen him in two years. Who knows, they may be deported. At least they'll have spoken. Of course it's between us. Thank you. And who are you? Yes, maybe that's better. Thank you very much. It's strictly forbidden, but he might let him phone tonight. They're clearing for the dig for freedom campaign. - What? Replacing forests with potatoes. Do all refugees go to prison? We too? I don't know. He says it's a camp. God! It's Franz! You said we'll be deported? Only to get him moving. Leave him to me. I'm coming! Why does she serve in the kitchen? I beg your pardon? Who are they? What's going on here? What are you doing? They said on the radio there are too many already. We shouldn't allow any more in. And here they are in my kitchen as if they were at home! They offered to pay for everything. What would these be worth? So! They tried to bribe you! If it's real silver! Such a fuss over a slice of bread and a few eggs! Give them an inch... - The waitress's purse is gone! - It's right here. See? You don't trust them either! Who knows why they had to flee. Permit me, Ostrowskij is my name. Mr. Flückiger, my husband. And they're choosy, too. You know that Tuesdays are meatless. I don't want to hear it! They're already watching us innkeepers. We couldn't do it for long without food coupons anyway. Hey, Otti! Want to earn something extra? Stop blabbing it about! Go, quickly, get the policeman. We need him here. We don't need him. They would have left after dark. You'll get the ham afterwards. In the kitchen of all places. Full of lice and stuff. That one's wearing your own jacket. Get out! Let them wait for the police in the wash-house. And... we're not fooled by that bandage! Come, Olaf! Is the whole house full of them? You're right. We're being stupid. We're only delaying death by running off. Let's stand still next time they shoot, that will end it. There's a bullet in there? You should have called the doctor instead of frying eggs! - The doctor's an agitator! - At least get the first aid kit! Here... kitty, kitty... Don't stand there. Go to the wash-house so you won't be seen. Over here. It's not my fault. It would be better in the kitchen. You sell them out for some sausage! They have to screen everyone they let in. Nothing's happened so far. I know nothing about bullet wounds. What if everyone did as they liked without obeying the laws? I can't look at that! You'd better not be so Jewish when the police come. You see... this... this Goebbels... asked a Jew: Why are you so proud to be a Jew? The Jew answered: If I'm not proud, I'm still a Jew. So, I prefer to be proud. But we don't like that here. At least, I could shave a little. Boss! What did he say? The policeman's expected back soon, the parish clerk said. Any moment. He said the refugees... should go to the police station. That's what he said. - What's this about refugees? - But, I thought... Will you shut up! What did he say? My ham? Get out of my sight. You can't even follow orders. Come on, Rex. Don't be afraid! There's no chance... Listen, Reverend, let me explain... Only political refugees have a chance. Being Jewish isn't enough. Can't you call someone...? Imagine if they all came here! I've never seen a refugee before. Don't you think our government thought it over? The heart alone is often too stupid. Then give me back my basket, if I must feed them alone. Nothing has been decided yet! Wait for the police. Maybe some of them can stay. Who says so? Deserters can stay, for example. And with little children... they close an eye... then the parents may also stay, even if they aren't political refugees. You didn't say so before! Well, if you go running off! And old people also if they can pay the bail. What's the matter? I brought vegetables from the garden. That's very nice. Thank you. You learned dress-making, didn't you? Long ago. Try it on, Felix. He hasn't worn his uniform for a year. I had to let it out. Is he an army chaplain? Fresh air won't hurt him. If only it wasn't for that Hitler. Mrs. Flückiger will need her basket. Of course. How old should these children be? Pre-school age, so we can make something of them. You could help things along. Someone managed to fool the police by making families. All refugees had small children or grey hair. They usually have no passports anyway. For heaven's sake, don't say I told you. Where were you? I've been doing everything! I came for my suitcase. Is Anni with you? Can I help you? That's all I need! Come on. Let's see. You could be brother and sister. Where have you been? Come over here, quickly. These are your children. Will it work? - Why? - You must be a family. For the police. As father! We'll say the boy is five. I'd have had to get married at twelve! And you... You'd better stay the grandfather. That is my grandchild. The children could be mine! Well? My son-in-law in the Wehrmacht? I'll need other pants. Come, Olaf. Let's hide. - You won't get far now. - Can't we just tell the truth? And the law? Let me be the father. No. Deserters can stay anyway. Why didn't you say that before? What really gets me is that we have to feed runaway Nazis because of some international law, while those you torment are sent back! What if it breaks out here... At least you'll be in jail, you bastards! You wear the uniform. - The kid? - The bullet wound makes it credible. I'd rather remain the deserter. He needs the uniform! Please, bring us the jacket. I feel like a fugitive myself! Off with the boots. Now be the father. - What if they learn of your husband? - You must call me Judith. It won't be for long. - I hoped the new girl would serve. - Who? Let's see her. Why do you hide her? This week's left-overs again! Better than sawdust in the bread like over there. What will it be? Three beers. Where's your beautiful Jewish broad? Are there any in the village? Is that why the shutters are closed? The heat softened your brain! You see? Now it's my fault. You blared it out. It's good they're out of the kitchen. Shouldn't we ask the doctor about the arm? Then it'll really get hot. Come and eat now. Where did you go anyway? Well, I... There'll be some left-overs... if they're still hungry out there. There'll be no more customers now. I feel locked up in my own house. Do you think they walked all the way? I would have liked... to travel abroad if there were no war. Later perhaps. No. Before. This is Radio Beromünster. From Zurich the news. Here is the news from the Swiss news agency in Bern. For the protection of the country the Federal Council has decided to increase the penalty for spreading rumors. Can you manage with your arm, Olaf? What if the doctors here measure me because of race? You must only speak out. But what? Hurry. Number 44, you said? Nickolsburger Street, number 44. Judith Schneider, 44, Nickolsburger Street. You'd better have her hide your passport. - Photos and all? - Let's see! Krüger, Judith... that's no Jewish name. What's wrong? Let's see. Go on... and then what? We were ordered to get divorced because I'm a Jew and you're not, but we... He sent me to Holland... he stayed because he's a teacher. He was arrested. But I'm a carpenter. Obviously he's never used a woodsaw! Marabu, Listenow, Doctor... Krüger! Over here! Hurry up! Krüger! Is your wife's name Judith? Yes. Then pump up my tire. I don't know how, but... she is in Switzerland. Where? But don't they send them all back? Here's the address and money. Maybe you'll reach her in time. Stop staring or they'll notice. I haven't locked the bike. That way. Ask some child for directions. Take cover! Stop! Krüger! You're crazy! Don't move! Don't shoot! We'll get him! - Mrs. Krüger? - No, I am your mother. I don't understand my brother at all. Say, "I'll be six in September." Can you? I will be six in September. Please! It won't work without him. Help me! Do something! We'll say he's deaf and dumb. Can you do that? You're a good boy. Sugar cube. Policeman. Policeman... no talk. Then... you... sugar... O.K.? Bigler, District Police. Good afternoon. For the refugees, it says. Anonymous, left outside the door. You can distribute it. I didn't understand you. You see! They're from across the border. Hands on the wall! - Eckert, Klaus, 3rd... - To the wall! - Eckert, Klaus, 3rd... - Slowly. - He's been shot. - I can see that myself. They send children to war. Did you say "Egger"? Eckert, Klaus, 3rd Foresters, 258. Why do you travel with Jews? You as a Nazi. It didn't make sense any more. What? I signed up as a volunteer because you get a high school diploma. But now we'd have been sent to the Eastern front. People like you go to jail here. How do you know the others are Jews? They don't deny it. That's an admission. It's not just how they look. See, they have blond ones, too. Only my wife is Jewish. They arrested Karl because he refused to divorce me. Your names, please. Schneider, Karl. Schneider, Judith. Your maiden name? Ostrowskij. She is my daughter. My name is Lazar Ostrowskij. If that can be written without breaking a finger. It's simple: Wood... Sophie... King... Italy... Judge. Unfortunately they took away our papers. We asked a couple of lovers... one evening in France about directions. And the man went like this... But we fled from the police station. Except for my mother. They beat her because we escaped... with a hazelwood cane. And they sang. Remember the song? About the Red Sea? - No. Stop. - But it's important. We had to listen. We couldn't help. We have orders to trust only official reports. ...through the Red Sea... The Jew wanders here and there through the Red Sea unaware. The waters come together fast. The world has peace at last. Is that true? They did that to old people? Yes. Even worse... we also had to sing. When Jewish blood drips off the knife, we're much better off... It must be true if even the Nazis are fed up. If everything we sing were true... Come to the kitchen... you can't write properly out here. We must watch who we let in. Exactly. Have they been fed? If possible, refugees should be fed. You can see the plates. We're no pigs, you know. Don't you say thank you? He's deaf and dumb. Is that why he wears a turban? That's a vinegar rag to kill lice. Get away from there! He hears pretty well for a deaf and dumb boy. Stop it! He lost his speech in a bomb attack. As if you'd been there. - It happens. - Can't he say his name? Can't he even say his own name? Cherries... eat them... He needs to go to the toilet. I'll show him where it is. You're out of your mind. Is he to keep quiet forever? Suddenly he'll talk. That happens with shock. - Boom! He speaks French. - Then we'll teach him. We? I thought he had to pee? You're so smart. You think he's a Jew? I've always wanted to see a Jew's... Filthy pig! Schneider, Gitty. Born? March 12th, 1932, and my brother will be six in September. Born in Vienna, you said? Well, can they stay? I'll read this... if it still applies. In recent times we have therefore been forced... Here! "All illegally entering refugees are to be sent back without fail." Wait... there are exceptions: Not to be sent back are: A) Deserters... Though I think they're the worst. Prisoners of war. Doesn't apply. B) Political cases, refugees from racial persecution, such as Jews, are not considered to be political refugees. C) Children traveling alone... D) Parents of children under age six... They're lucky, it seems. We have to keep them. There are still many phone calls to Bern and some red tape... if someone pays the bail for them. What? Do you have money? Valuables? A lot? About 3,000 or 4,000 francs each, depending. Are you crazy? It isn't for me. Imagine the cost of feeding them. 7,000 mouths per day all year round. Or, to send them elsewhere, a boat to South America costs plenty! She could help out here a bit. A cheap maid... I can imagine for what. Now you've gone too far. The immigration police are sharp on that. - May I go to the kitchen? - Why? - For something. - Out of the question. Does anyone have a knife? Wait! What for? Where did you get this knife? This is all we own. Let's see what we can do. I'll write a receipt. We can't use that. What stones are they? Rubies. From my grandmother. 23 rubies in a brooch, correct? How do you spell rubies? Can they stay now, or what? Yes... if the stones aren't just glass. Go, get some wood. Wood! Outside! What about Olaf? He'll go to the hospital. The beds aren't quite the same height. Never mind. We're not quite married, either. I almost believed it myself. Can I help? Who'd believe you'll sleep in the corner? It's too obvious! In return, you can have a bath first. There'll be no racial mixing! You won't need that cap. How did you use a gun if you can't even use a spoon? - It's my arm. - Nonsense! Here! What's going on here? Look how he'd have eaten in Russia in the trenches! - But... - I thought it was just a disguise! He knows we must keep deserters. No drinks? I'll be right with you. - A circus? - No circus. Just look at him. 15 weeks in training camp. Take it off! Where did you get the uniform? In the newsreels they always fit perfectly. You actually like them? And that's probably red paint, eh? A lodged bullet or shot through? From... a gun. Amazing, your military education. By tonight I'll have you over the border. Personally! You can't. With that arm. My fingers are numb. With luck, you'll be healed before you're deported. And who pays the hospital? Or are you one of those others? Not all marriages are made in heaven. Stay away from the window. Isn't it settled yet? Just for the time being, until it's official. I wouldn't know what to pack... for a lifetime! Do you have any soap? Thank you. Is he your brother, the little soldier? Why? What's wrong? Will he be jailed after the hospital? If they accept him. Now you have a choice. That's Hannes. Who? That must be for me, Franz. Mill Restaurant. Who's calling? Who is this? What is the name? Krüger? No. Wrong number. - You know any Krüger? - No Krüger. Judith, you said? What does she look like? This one doesn't have short hair. Hey, Mrs. Schneider, or whoever you are. I'm just changing. Hurry! It might be long distance. Does anyone know you're in Switzerland? What happened here? Are you suddenly interested in Nazis? Or is he one of you? I never saw him until the station at Belfort. You bitch! I should have turned you all in at the train. Enough! It's getting expensive. Schneider. No! Yes, Hannes, I'm happy. Leave her alone. She's not a prisoner! I can't hear anything. He has no more change... my brother. He's a real bastard. He's real sweet, the brother. You know this Hannes? Your wife knows him rather well. She won't let him declare his love. Want to listen? She isn't really my wife... Look! I'm the real deserter. They made me give them my uniform. Hands on the wall! There... you piggies! It'll warm up again soon. I'll scoop it out for you. Washing the corpses. Don't say that, now that everything's gone well, and in front of the children. Flora Street 11. You'll be there before midnight? Don't take any chances. I'll get my own beer. Look! Here she is! I'll try my best. No. I'm "Schneider" on the false papers. Say something to me, just something, something natural, even if they hear it. Let me take him. Let me go! I want to go home! Where is your mother? Is that her? I want to go home. You went too far! You'll be flying back over the border, I guarantee it! We'd never have imagined all those tricks for fooling people. A pack of gypsies! Hey, kiddie... Where's the road to town? To town! The road to town? Wait! Do you know Flora Street? In town. Number 12, I believe. Is she pretty? Could you drive someone there? Or at least into town? The one... in the kitchen in the dotted dress. She'd be worth the trouble. - Why not? - Not so loud. Don't let Bigler hear. How will I find you again? - Is he also your husband? - Mummy, what did they do? Come on, move. Sit down. Terrible, when you think of it. At least he'll go to the hospital first. But the bigger one gets locked up. They've already pissed, so don't fall for that one. Unless they grab a drink with their free hand. Ready? Where's the old man? Isn't he clean yet? Give me some cigars for the road. Shame on you, for being so smug. Like at the cattle market. Franz, keep an eye on her. Come on, let's go. What's wrong? It's too late to bathe. Grandpa! - Let him stay. He's so old. - He also lied. He was in on the cheating. But it's all true what happened to us. Our orders are clear. I even phoned Bern. I don't want to hear any more. You'll need these on your trip. They paid for our food. Hurry up, Anni. You can put that on my bike. It's really terrible. At least the children could stay in the village. None of your business. Especially you, who have none. Grab her! Let's stop this show right now. Drive these two to town. Get up! You can lock me up but I'll find my husband. Which one? They're a different breed of people. Take it. It's from my garden and some chocolate for the child. Did they really eat Flückiger's cat? Yes... butchered in the wash-house. Don't talk nonsense! - I want no trouble here. - They'll fill the phone book - from -vitch to -itzkis! - True! Do you want to drag them to the Alps if we go to war? Without room or food? The General said they'll hang on here and take over. Is escaping from the refugee camp punished severely? He won't find the town. We took down all the road signs. As long as overfed dogs run free here! I'll sneak you over the border. Then you can go wherever you like. Don't touch me! I don't like this either. Why doesn't Flückiger lend his motorbike? Did she steal something? If you refuse, then I must touch you. Stop that praying. You'll just antagonize them more. Your husband will be deported if you're not up at the count of three! Jesus! The priest! There! This is no solution. Go away! This is not for children. Could you make a detour for a good cause? Is the church filling the tank? Just to the border. It's such a long walk. I'm not a taxi for migrant birds. An hour more or less on foot won't affect them. Look at the old man and the shoes that woman is wearing. We'll load my bike and I'll ride it back. I won't risk my job for the likes of her. My boss also dislikes them. The beer truck was your idea. It's all your fault. Were you going, too? An innkeeper should set a good example. You believe her now... after all the lies she told today! I can't go on. At least load the bags on the bike. I'm sorry I shouted at you before. Please, listen... There's nothing doing! Look, here's the kitty. See, now it's back and you're happy. You could have lent Bigler your motorbike. If it must be, then better quickly. On foot they'll stay alive longer. Don't say that. It's almost dark, but even with the bike he won't reach town before midnight. If you think... In the long run... a child can be molded. Didn't you also like the little French boy? He'd learn our language. You'd better visit the doctor again. Not that Bertschi again! After the war I'll try in town. There's always gossip. You needn't listen. When you marry an old woman, you get a home without a future. Too bad, rabbits get eaten if they don't breed. If you think... What? What's bothering you? Nothing. In the long run... she rather scared me... almost like an animal. They begin by stealing. - She's fighting for her life! - Strange... your sudden pity. I almost believe it's that foreign bitch. They're long over the border. Even on foot. Pull yourself together. It's not far now. To Theresienstadt? What? Don't bother. It's not even loaded. - They'll do it over there anyway. - Nonsense! Just try once more. Couldn't you have come sooner? Not with everyone watching. My wife's mad because I called you in. Well, get on! You've really terrified them. Don't look like that since you're betraying us. What? You think I'll follow by bike? Put him in between. O.K. I'll drive. What if something happens with all these people? The clutch is loose. Maybe it's better if someone drives who isn't in uniform. Take the short cut. I'll wait by the marsh. You'll be glad you're not alone with them. The old man almost shot himself just now. You must promise... We'll put your bike on the side-car afterwards. Show me the address. Which? In town. It sounded like Flora Street. Where your husband said. Who lives there? A man who once helped my husband. And the border? Bigler will go home when he's cold. What will he say? He won't squeal on himself. What kind of load is that? Why? Some more knife-grinders. Turn around and come with us. - Do you know something? - What? Now you see. I thought you'd tell me something. Come in. It hurts without a foreskin, right? Or is it your bad conscience? The bribes no longer work. You can run if you prefer being tied to the stirrups. All these damn refugees! They eat double the army's meat rations. And they get our best lodgings. Quiet, up there! Good morning. How many are we? Come on, get the stuff. You're the smallest ruffians I ever saw. Or do you think you're something better? Hannes? I kept thinking of you with short hair. Get inside! You too. This is my wife. Sorry, we can't comply. Give me your belt. If I'd only had another bike. Call the driver before there's a drama here. - Why don't you say anything? - Two years in one minute! You should finish now. - What? - The truck's expected any moment. You'd better go now. Is Olaf here, too? And your mother? Didn't you get my letter? And Sara, with the children? I've come for the people from yesterday. Now you even missed your breakfast. We're being sent straight back. That's not true! Bring everyone from 42! Check if the cell's tidied up. - Say nothing. - But she's my wife! I didn't make these laws, but there must be a reason. Come on. Clear away the dishes. One breakfast is left. Why can't we stay together? She'll say she's pregnant to avoid deportation. Judith! Where are we? We want the Marseille-Lisbon route. Arrange that with the German authorities, they will look after you. Come on! Preserves. Is this yours? Rationed foods can't be exported. Sorry. Eat now, as much as you can. The cutlery and jewelry, are they yours? May I have a cigarette? Doctor... there's room for one in the Free-Place campaign, at least the little one. - His age? - 6 in September. No, I don't want to! Leave me alone! You're a doctor? - Why am I deported if I'm pregnant? - Yesterday you expressly denied it. Out of fear. Have her examined. If she says so. Riding motorbikes won't get you pregnant. Or did you have Fatty stop in the woods? They'll try anything! Come along, you too. Judith and the girl were gassed in the concentration camp of Treblinka. Mr. Ostrowskij did not survive deportation. Olaf's arm healed. He was also deported and disappeared. Franz Flückiger received a Swiss prison sentence. The film is based on "The Boat Is Full" by Alfred A. Häsler, the report on refugee policy in Switzerland over the years 1933-55 by Prof. Carl Ludwig, The "History of Swiss Neutrality" by Prof. Edgar Bonjour, as well as historical archives and conversations with those affected. We thank the population of Siblingen for their hospitality and cooperation.
