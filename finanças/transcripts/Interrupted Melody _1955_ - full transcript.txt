THAT'S WHAT WAGNER WROTE. WHY CAN'T YOU LET ME DO WHAT-- NO, NO. NO GALLOPING! NOT AT THE METROPOLITAN. THE RISK IS TOO GREAT. YOU WILL WALK THE HORSE. BUT MY SISTER'S A GOOD RIDER, HERR SACHSE. SHE'S HANDLED HORSES SINCE SHE WAS 5. THIS IS GOTTERDAMMERUNG, NOT A CIRCUS! AFTER 5 HOURS OF SINGING, SHE STILL WANTS TO GALLOP. [MEN LAUGHING] ENOUGH DISCUSSION! LET'S GET ON WITH THE REHEARSAL! AND YOU WALK THAT HORSE INTO THE FLAMES. YOU CAN MAKE A HORSE GALLOP INTO FLAMES, BUT NO SENSIBLE HORSE WALKS INTO FIRE! I DON'T CARE ABOUT A SENSIBLE HORSE! I WANT A SENSIBLE PRIMA DONNA! [EXASPERATED SIGH] BUT MY WAY IS SPECTACULAR. IT HAS DASH AND STYLE! YOURS IS TAME. THAT'S WHAT IT IS, TAME! NOT IF YOU DO IT RIGHT! WATCH ME! DIGNIFIED! IMPRESSIVE! SPECTACULAR! I STILL PREFER IT MY WAY. MY DEAR MISS LAWRENCE, AT THE METROPOLITAN OPERA, WE ASK OUR PRIMA DONNAS ONLY TO SING WELL. IT'S NOT IMPORTANT THAT THEY SHOULD ALSO BE JOCKEYS.

"LAST NIGHT AT THE METROPOLITAN OPERA, MARJORIE LAWRENCE CAPTURED NEW YORK." Guests: OH! WHOEVER HE IS, THAT MAN'S MY FAVORITE CRITIC. Cyril: ALL RIGHT, NOW, WHERE WAS I? OH, YES. "A GREAT DEAL OF THE CREDIT SHOULD GO TO DR. LEOPOLD SACHSE I WAS INSPIRED. AND SO WAS THE HORSE. [LAUGHTER] SINCE WE'RE ALL FRIENDS HERE, I MAY AS WELL TELL YOU. DR. SACHSE HAD ANOTHER INSPIRATION. HAD I? YES. WHEN I DO SALOME, HE WANTS ME TO DANCE IT AS WELL AS SING IT. OH, NO. NOT AT THE METROPOLITAN. MARY GARDEN DID IT IN PARIS. SHE'S THE ONLY ONE. [LAUGHTER] SUPPER'S SERVED. SUPPER, EVERYBODY. GOOD. I'M FAMISHED. PERHAPS WE CAN READ THE NOTICES AGAIN FOR DESSERT. TOM! BOTTOMS UP. HI. I'M SO GLAD YOU COULD COME. OH, DR. KING, MY BROTHER CYRIL. PLEASURE. AND HERR DR.

WOULD YOU COME THIS WAY? EXCUSE ME. YOU KNOW, I DID RECOGNIZE YOU, TOM, BUT IN ALL THE CONFUSION-- THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I UNDERSTAND. YOU DON'T OWE ME ANY APOLOGY. THAT'S WHAT YOU BROUGHT ME HERE TO TELL ME? NO. I WANTED TO SEE YOU PROFESSIONALLY, TOO. THE METROPOLITAN HAS ITS OWN DOCTORS, DON'T THEY? YES, I KNOW THAT, BUT I PREFERRED YOU. THANK YOU. WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE TROUBLE? UH, MY THROAT. IT FEELS ROUGH. YEAH? LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT IT. WANT TO SIT DOWN THERE? THAT THROAT OF YOURS HAD QUITE A WORKOUT LAST NIGHT. FROM WHAT I HEARD, IT DIDN'T STOP WHEN THE CURTAIN WENT DOWN. OPEN UP. YES, NO WONDER IT FEELS ROUGH. IS THERE ANYTHING WRONG? NO, NOTHING SERIOUS. JUST TOO MUCH PARTY, TOO MUCH TENSION, TOO MUCH EXCITEMENT. IN FACT, IF EVERYBODY WAS AS HEALTHY AS YOU, I WOULDN'T HAVE VERY MUCH OF A FUTURE. WELL, THAT'S THAT. TOM? CARE FOR A DRINK? PROFESSIONAL VISIT OVER? YES. OH, AND I AM SORRY ABOUT TONIGHT. HI, MARGE. HELLO, TOM. COME ON OVER HERE AND TELL ME EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING TO YOU. NOT VERY MUCH TO TELL YOU. I HAVEN'T GOTTEN MY BOX AT THE DIAMOND HORSESHOE, BUT I'M GOING TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH ONE OF THE VERY TOP MEN IN MY FIELD. YOU KNOW, YOU NEVER TOLD ME WHAT YOUR FIELD WAS? YES. WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW THEN, BUT I KNOW NOW. WELL, WHAT? I'M GOING TO LIKE BRINGING NEW BABIES INTO THE WORLD. NEW BABIES? THAT'S RIGHT. OH, WHAT A HAPPY WAY TO PRACTICE MEDICINE. UH, HAVE ANY CHILDREN OF YOUR OWN? HA HA! WELL, WHAT A QUESTION TO ASK A BACHELOR. HA HA! OH, DR. KING, YOU HAVE AN AMAZING BESIDE MANNER. OH, IT'S NOTHING AT ALL. I FEEL LIKE A NEW WOMAN. YOU DO? YES. I'M SUDDENLY RELAXED AND HAPPY AND HUNGRY. LET'S HAVE SOME SUPPER. NO, NO. I'M NOT VERY HUNGRY, BUT I'LL TAKE YOU UP ON THE DRINK YOU OFFERED ME. ALL RIGHT. THE LEAST I CAN DO IS OFFER A TOAST THAT YOU AND THE COMTE WILL BE VERY HAPPY. OH? COMTE WHO? THE FELLOW YOU'RE GOING TO MARRY. IT'S BEEN IN ALL THE PAPERS. YOU DON'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU READ IN THE PAPERS, NOW, DO YOU? COME TO THINK OF IT, MARGE, I AM HUNGRY. WELL, ALL RIGHT, THEN LET'S GO. NOT OUT THERE WITH THAT MOB, THOUGH-- I MEAN, UNLESS YOU REALLY HAVE TO. I DON'T HAVE TO. I DON'T EVEN WANT TO. FINE, FINE. WELL, NOW, MY PROFESSIONAL ADVICE IS YOU GET IN BED AND GET SOME REST, BUT PERSONALLY, HOW ABOUT PUTTING ON YOUR WALKING SHOES AND GOING OUT WITH ME? HMM? OH, DOCTOR, YOU'RE THE DOCTOR! Cyril: GOOD EVENING. OR PERHAPS I SHOULD SAY GOOD MORNING. [CHUCKLES] GOOD MORNING. IT WAS SWEET OF YOU, CYRIL DEAR, BUT YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO WAIT UP FOR ME. ON THE CONTRARY, I DID HAVE TO WAIT UP FOR YOU. I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET A WORD WITH YOU FOR A WEEK NOW, AND THIS SEEMED TO BE THE ONLY SOLUTION. I KNOW IT'S TERRIBLY SORDID OF ME, BUT THERE'S ONE OR TWO BUSINESS-- SEE THAT WAY OVER THERE? THAT'S THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING. FASCINATING. TOM AND I WERE UP THERE A LITTLE WHILE AGO. HAS THE MOST GLORIOUS VIEW. THERE ARE SOME OTHER SIGHTS IN NEW YORK I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU-- THE BOOKING OFFICE TO DISCUSS YOUR SOUTH AMERICAN TOUR AND DATES FOR COVENT GARDEN, THE REHEARSAL ROOMS AT THE MET, ONE OR TWO CONCERT HALLS, THE PUBLICITY OFFICE FOR PHOTOGRAPHS AND INTERVIEWS, AND THE WIG MAKER'S, UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOU'RE PLANNING TO BE THE FIRST BLOND CARMEN IN THE HISTORY OF OPERA. HA HA. IT'S AN IDEA. OH, BE A DARLING. TAKE CARE OF THE WIG FOR ME. I'D LOVE TO. SHALL I HAVE MY HEAD SHRUNK SO IT WILL FIT YOU WHEN IT'S DONE? ALL RIGHT, I'LL GO TO THE WIG MAKER. WHEN, TOMORROW? NO, NOT TOMORROW. I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT AT THE HAIRDRESSER'S. I'M GOING TO A DANCE TOMORROW NIGHT WITH TOM AT THE HOSPITAL. IT'S FOR THE DOCTORS AND THEIR WIVES AND THE INTERNS AND NURSES. WHAT JOLLY FUN. IF YOU'D LIKE TO COME ALONG, I'LL TALK TO TOM. MAYBE HE CAN ARRANGE IT WITH ONE OF THE NURSES. I DON'T NEED A NURSE. WHAT I NEED IS A NERVE SPECIALIST. OH, THAT'S FUNNY, CYRIL. THAT'S REALLY VERY FUNNY. HA HA! I DIDN'T INTEND IT TO BE. GOOD NIGHT! [SINGING IN GERMAN] [SIGHS] LET'S DO IT AGAIN. PICK IT UP FROM, UH... [TELEPHONE RINGS] Cyril: HELLO? YES? JUST A MINUTE. PUT HIM THROUGH, WILL YOU? IS IT TOM? IT'S THE COMTE CALLING FROM PARIS. I'M NOT IN! HELLO, CLAUDE. NO, SHE'S NOT IN. LET'S STOP FOR TODAY. SAME TIME TOMORROW? YES. UM, NO, NO. I'LL GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU. YES, I'LL TELL HER. I'LL CALL YOU BACK. LOOK HERE, CLAUDE'S NO FOOL. YOU NEVER ANSWERED HIS CABLES, AND HE WANTS TO KNOW IF HE SHOULD COME TO NEW YORK. NO! TELL HIM NOT TO. OH, I'LL WRITE HIM. DON'T BE AN IDIOT. YOU'D GIVE UP SOMEONE LIKE CLAUDE TO MARRY A PILL-PUSHER? YES, IF HE ASKS ME. DON'T WORRY. HE WILL. HE'S SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT HE'LL GET IF HE MARRIES YOU-- A FREE MEAL TICKET AND THE CLASSIEST PRACTICE IN NEW YORK. FOR A SOLID MONTH HE'S RUSHED YOU, AND HE DOESN'T EVEN PHONE YOU NOW. HE KNOWS YOU WANT WHAT YOU CAN'T HAVE, SO HE PLAYS HARD TO GET. THE TROUBLE WITH YOU IS THAT MY SUCCESS HAS GONE TO YOUR HEAD! YOU TELL YOUR HUSBAND YOU'RE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT, MRS. SCHULTZ. THERE'S NO REASON WHY THE BABY SHOULDN'T BE. YOU TAKE THOSE CALCIUM PILLS I GAVE YOU. DON'T FORGET. I PROMISE, DOCTOR. I'LL SEE YOU IN ABOUT A MONTH? YES. BYE-BYE. GOOD-BYE. ANY OF THOSE FOR ME? FOR DR. BRUCE. YOU'RE DUE AT THE CLINIC IN 20 MINUTES. MM-HMM. I'LL GRAB A BITE AND GET GOING. [INTERCOM BUZZES] YES? Woman: MISS MARJORIE LAWRENCE TO SEE YOU, DOCTOR. SEND HER IN. I'VE BEEN HOPING ALL WEEK YOU'D BREAK DOWN AND CALL ME. ONE OF US HAS TO BE SENSIBLE. NOW, LOOK, MARGE, ALL THE TALKING IN THE WORLD ISN'T GOING TO CHANGE ONE THING. I CAN'T ASK YOU TO MARRY ME. I'M JUST GETTING STARTED. YOU'RE ALREADY AT THE PEAK OF YOUR CAREER. BUT I COULD HELP YOU. I COULDN'T LET YOU DO THAT. I TOLD YOU. YOU'D ACCEPT A GRANT FROM THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION, WOULDN'T YOU? I'M NOT IN LOVE WITH THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION. MAYBE YOU'RE NOT IN LOVE WITH ME. THEN WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE WHO HAS THE MONEY? IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF MONEY. MARRIAGE TO ME MEANS A HOME, CHILDREN, AND A WIFE RIGHT THERE TO TAKE CARE OF THEM. YOUR WORK TAKES YOU ALL OVER THE WORLD. DO YOU WANT ME TO GIVE UP MY SINGING? I CAN'T ASK YOU TO GIVE UP ANYTHING. LOOK, NO MARRIAGE HAS A CHANCE AGAINST SUCH ODDS. THAT'S WHY THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO. YES, YES. LET'S GET OUT OF THIS WHILE THERE'S STILL TIME. [INTERCOM BUZZES] YES? Woman: YOU'LL BE LATE FOR THE CLINIC, DR. KING. YEAH, ALL RIGHT. I'M LEAVING RIGHT NOW. YOU CAN'T LEAVE IT LIKE THIS. MAY I SEE YOU LATER? I'M BUSY ALL AFTERNOON, MARGE. OH, TOM. HOW ABOUT TONIGHT? YES! OH, I CAN'T. I'M LEAVING TONIGHT FOR A CONCERT IN CHICAGO. WELL, THERE YOU ARE. THAT WAS A NICE BIT OF SURGERY WE DID ON THAT KID. I FEEL PRETTY GOOD. WHAT'S THE MATTER, OFF YOUR FEED? NO, I'M FINE. HOW'S THE NURSE IN OBSTETRICS? A LIVING, BREATHING DOLL. GOOD NIGHT, TOM. GOOD NIGHT, ED. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I THOUGHT YOU WERE ON THE WAY TO CHICAGO. I DON'T HAVE TO BE ANYPLACE. I'M A LADY OF LEISURE. MARGE, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? I'M JUST FINE. OH, DOCTOR, YOU'RE A WONDERFUL DOCTOR, AND YOU GIVE SUCH GOOD ADVICE. A WIFE SHOULD BE HOME WITH HER HUSBAND. IT'S THE ONLY SENSIBLE WAY. SO I CANCELED THE CHICAGO CONCERT. WHAT? AND MY DEBUT AT COVENT GARDEN. OH, NO, MARGE. DON'T INTERRUPT. YOU CAN'T DO THAT. YOU MUSTN'T. IT'S ALREADY DONE. YOU CAN'T GIVE UP SINGING. I'M NOT GOING TO, BUT I'M ONLY GOING TO SING WHERE YOU CAN HEAR ME. BETWEEN CALLS TO THE CLINIC, OF COURSE. WELL, I DON'T KNOW. DON'T LOOK SCARED. I STILL HAVE THE METROPOLITAN. YOU MEAN YOU'D GIVE UP ALL THE REST OF IT JUST FOR ME? I'VE HAD ALL THE REST. I JUST WANT TO BE MRS. THOMAS KING. I-- OH! OH, TOM! [TELEPHONE RINGING] Tom: MARGE, THE PHONE. Marge: MUST WE, DARLING? YEAH, WE MUST. IT'S IN THE HIPPOCRATIC OATH SOMEWHERE. OH! HELLO? YES? WELL, I'LL SEE IF DR. KING IS IN. OH, IT'S MRS. ARLEN AGAIN. I WISH I WAS AS HEALTHY AS SHE IS. HERE. HELLO? YES. YES, I'M TAKING DR. BRUCE'S CALLS TONIGHT. MM-HMM. OH? WHY DON'T YOU TRY A HOT COMPRESS, MRS. ARLEN, AND-- OH. OH. TRY A COLD COMPRE-- MM-HMM. YOU'VE TRIED THAT. LUKEWARM. [CHUCKLES] WHAT? OH. I THINK WHAT YOU REALLY NEED, MRS. ARLEN, IS, PERHAPS, A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP. YOU TAKE A COUPLE OF ASPIRIN, AND THEN IN THE MORNING, IF YOU'RE NOT FEELING ANY BETTER, THEN I SUGGEST YOU SEE DR. BRUCE. NO. IT'S A PLEASURE TO TALK TO YOU, MRS. ARLEN. ANY TIME. GOOD NIGHT. Marge: TOM? YEAH? WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HER? JUST LONELY, I GUESS. HMM. TOM, HOW LONG IS IT BEFORE IT SHOWS ON A WOMAN? WHAT SHOWS? YOU KNOW, HAVING A BABY. ARE YOU ASKING PERSONALLY OR FOR A FRIEND? I WAS JUST FIGURING. OH. WELL, YOU'RE FIGURING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. IF ANYTHING HAPPENS, YOU'LL LET ME KNOW, HMM? YOU'LL BE THE FIRST ONE I'LL GET IN TOUCH WITH. LET'S SEE. THIS IS MAY. THE SEASON STARTS IN NOVEMBER. WHAT SEASON? YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THING, I HOPE. THE OPERA SEASON AT THE MET. OH, THAT. WELL, YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES TO HAVE A BABY. THAT'S NO PROFESSIONAL SECRET. SUPPOSE I'M TOO LATE THIS YEAR. I'D NEVER GET AWAY WITH TRISTAN AND SALOME, WOULD I? WELL, YOU COULD DO FALSTAFF. IT'S NOT IN MY REPERTOIRE. I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS SUCH A PROBLEM HAVING CHILDREN. IT'S NO PROBLEM AT ALL IF YOU'RE A GOOD MANAGER. IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIMING. I KNEW A PRIMA DONNA ONCE WHO HAD A BABY AFTER EVERY SEASON. SHE HAD THE LARGEST REPERTOIRE OF ANYONE ON THE CONTINENT. THE FIRST BOY WAS COVENT GARDEN. THERE'S A GREAT NAME FOR A BOY. I MEAN HE WAS BORN AFTER THE COVENT GARDEN SEASON. THEN THERE WAS THE LA SCALA BABY, AND THE NEXT ONE WAS A VIENNA BABY. SHE HAD 7 IN ALL. SHE WAS ABOUT THE SMARTEST PRIMA DONNA THAT EVER LIVED. THAT'S OBVIOUS. WHAT WAS HER NAME? ELSA HOFFNER. THE PERSON I'D LIKE TO TALK TO IS MR. HOFFNER. THERE WAS NO MR. HOFFNER. WHAT? I MEAN, HOFFNER WAS HER NAME. HIS NAME WAS, UH, OH, I DON'T REMEMBER. ANYWAY, WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE? MIGHT MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO HIM. DID YOU EVER MEET HIM? ONCE. HE'S A NICE, QUIET MAN. WHAT ELSE DID HE DO? NOTHING. JUST TRAVELED AROUND, HAD A GOOD TIME. I CAN SEE THAT. TOM? HMM? ARE YOU SORRY YOU MARRIED ME? AFTER WHAT YOU TOLD ME ABOUT ELSA HOFFNER... POSITIVELY NO. MMM! MISS LAWRENCE. MARJORIE, YOU LOOK RADIANT. THANK YOU. MARRIAGE AGREES WITH YOU. I RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY. AND TO YOU, TOO, CYRIL. WELL, NOW THAT I'VE GIVEN MY TESTIMONIAL ON MARRIAGE, WHAT'S REALLY ON YOUR MIND? PLEASE, MARJORIE. YOU'RE SO BUSINESSLIKE. IT GIVES ME NO CHANCE TO BE CHARMING. IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE CHARMING, IT MUST BE BAD NEWS. IT IS. IT'S ABOUT YOUR LATIN AMERICAN TOUR. I THINK IT WAS VERY UNWISE OF YOU TO CANCEL IT. I DON'T NEED THE TOUR TO LEARN ISOLDE. I'M ALREADY PREPARING THE PART. BUT YOU'VE NEVER DONE IT IN FRONT OF AN AUDIENCE. WE'RE DOING TRISTAN UND ISOLDE WITH AN EXPERIENCED CAST, EXCEPT FOR YOU. WE HAVE NEITHER THE TIME NOR THE MONEY TO SPEND ON EXTENSIVE REHEARSALS. REALLY, ANY TOUR IS OUT OF THE QUESTION AT THIS TIME. MY DEAR MARJORIE, PLEASE DON'T FORCE ME INTO DELIVERING AN ULTIMATUM. I'M AS EAGER AS YOU ARE TO OPEN NEXT SEASON WITH YOUR DEBUT IN ISOLDE, BUT WITHOUT THIS TOUR, IT WOULDN'T BE POSSIBLE. THINK IT OVER... PLEASE. MARGE! OH, SO YOU CAN TALK! BACK IN THERE, YOU NEVER OPENED YOUR MOUTH! WELL, THERE WAS NOTHING TO SAY. HE WAS RIGHT. I'M NOT GOING ON THAT TOUR, AND I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY DO ABOUT IT! MARGE, DON'T TALK LIKE THAT. IT'S YOUR WHOLE CAREER, YOUR FUTURE. YOU CAN'T THROW IT AWAY. THE METROPOLITAN WON'T GAMBLE ON A HOUSEWIFE WHO SINGS FOR A HOBBY! YOU HAVE TO GO. WELL, I WON'T! I PROMISED TOM. MAYBE YOU PROMISED HIM TOO MUCH. IT'S JUST RIDICULOUS. WORK AND SLAVE FOR YEARS. FINALLY YOU GET SOMEPLACE, AND YOU EXPECT FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE, AND WHAT HAPPENS? YOU'RE MORE OF A SLAVE THAN EVER. OH, IT'S ALL VERY POLITE, OF COURSE, BUT THEY MAKE IT QUITE CLEAR. IT'S DO IT THEIR WAY OR ELSE, HUH? YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE A PRIVATE LIFE. WELL, I GUESS YOU'LL HAVE TO GO. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? JUST WHAT I SAID. YOU'D LET ME GO? I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO GIVE UP THE MET, MARGE, AND IT WOULD SEEM THAT WITHOUT THE TOUR, THE MET'S OUT. BUT I PROMISED YOU. IF IT'S A PROMISE THAT'S HOLDING YOU BACK, I WON'T KEEP YOU TO IT. OH, TOM, I WAS WORRIED. YOU WERE. OH, DARLING. OH, YOU'RE SO WONDERFUL AND SWEET, AND I LOVE YOU--YOU'LL NEVER KNOW HOW MUCH. [TELEPHONE RINGING] HEY, THE PHONE! THE PHONE. THE PHONE, BABY. SOMEDAY I'M GOING TO RIP THAT PHONE OUT BY THE ROOTS. YEAH, I KNOW. I KNOW. HELLO. OH, YES. HELLO, MR. SCHULTZ. UH-HUH. ARE YOU SURE? DID YOU TIME THE PAINS LIKE I TOLD YOU TO? RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, YOU GRAB A CAB. I'LL MEET YOU BOTH AT THE HOSPITAL. NO, NO, DON'T WORRY. THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME. RIGHT. I'M LEAVING RIGHT NOW. WHAT DO YOU KNOW? MRS. SCHULTZ IS IN LABOR AT LAST. WELL, HOORAY FOR HER. SHE'S FINALLY HAVING HER DEBUT. HA HA! MARGE, HOW LONG WILL THIS TOUR LAST? 5 MONTHS. 5 MONTHS? I DIDN'T KNOW YOU'D BE GONE THAT LONG. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT LONG. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU COULD COME WITH ME-- OH, JUST THIS ONCE. WE'VE NEVER REALLY HAD A HONEYMOON, AND WITH YOU, SOUTH AMERICA WOULD BE SO ROMANTIC AND WONDERFUL. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SELL ME ON IT, MARGE. I'D LOVE TO GO. WELL, THEN WHY DON'T YOU? I CAN'T, MARGE. WHY NOT? OTHER DOCTORS TAKE TRIPS. THEY TRAVEL WITH THEIR WIVES, TAKE VACATIONS. THEY'RE NOT JUST GETTING STARTED. IF I WENT ON EVERY TOUR WITH MY WIFE, I'D HAVE NO PRACTICE TO COME BACK TO. TOM, LET'S FACE IT. WHAT HAVE YOU NOW? WHY DO YOU HAVE TO MAKE THINGS SO DIFFICULT FOR YOURSELF? EVERYTHING COULD BE SO EASY FOR US. WE COULD BE RICH AND HAPPY, AND WE COULD BE TOGETHER. AND I'D BE MR. MARJORIE LAWRENCE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. WE'D BETTER HAVE THIS OUT RIGHT HERE AND NOW. LOOK, I GOT TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL, MARGE. DO YOU MIND? THAT FINAL? YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID. THERE ARE OTHER DOCTORS. THERE ARE OTHER SINGERS. [MAN SINGING IN GERMAN] YOU FEELING ANY BETTER? NO, BUT I WILL BE AFTER THESE ASPIRIN. [WOMAN SINGING IN GERMAN] YOU SURE YOU'RE ALL RIGHT? STOP WORRYING, CYRIL. IT'S ONLY A HEADACHE. TAKE YOUR POSITION, PLEASE, MISS LAWRENCE. [SINGING IN GERMAN] [GASP] [SINGING IN GERMAN] [STRAINING] MARGE! NOW, LOOK, CYRIL, I'M NOT GOING TO LEAVE NOW. IN FACT, I CAN'T. YOU TELL MARGE-- ALL RIGHT. YEAH, PUT THE DOCTOR ON. I'LL TALK TO HIM. HELLO, DR. ORTEGA. IF ANYTHING? WHAT? ARE YOU SURE? I'LL GET A PLANE OUT OF HERE RIGHT AWAY. NO DOUBT ABOUT IT, DR. KING. THE REPORT ON THE SPINAL TAP, ALL THE TESTS-- A CONFIRMED DIAGNOSIS-- POLIO. HOW EXTENSIVE IS THE PARALYSIS? IF YOU WERE JUST A HUSBAND, I WOULD TELL YOU MANY EMPTY ENCOURAGEMENTS, BUT SINCE WE ARE BOTH DOCTORS... IT'S ALL MY FAULT. I HELPED TALK HER INTO THIS TRIP. IT'S NOBODY'S FAULT. IT JUST HAPPENED, THAT'S ALL. IT JUST HAPPENED. MAY I SEE MY WIFE NOW? YES. FOLLOW ME, PLEASE. HELLO, HONEY. [GASPING] TOM... TOM. IS IT REALLY YOU, TOM? YEP. LARGE AS LIFE AND TWICE AS UGLY. [GASPING] I WAS AFRAID YOU MIGHT NOT GET HERE SOON ENOUGH FOR ME TO TELL YOU I LOVE YOU. WHAT KIND OF IDEAS HAVE THEY BEEN PUTTING INTO YOUR HEAD? THEY HAVEN'T TOLD ME ANYTHING. HOW SICK AM I, TOM? TELL ME THE TRUTH. I PROMISE YOU THAT. YOU'RE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT. AM I? YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO MAKE A LIAR OUT OF ME, NOW, WOULD YOU? OH... I'VE BEEN SUCH A FOOL, TOM-- SUCH A FOOL. IF YOU WEREN'T A FOOL, YOU WOULDN'T HAVE MARRIED ME IN THE FIRST PLACE. [SOBBING] SHE SEEMED TO BE IMPROVING. SHE GOT BACK THE USE OF HER ARMS, HER SHOULDERS. THERE'S BEEN NO IMPROVEMENT SINCE THEN, YOU TOLD ME. WE JUST KEPT HOPING-- AT LEAST I KEPT HOPING. SHE LOST HOPE A LONG TIME AGO. DR. KING, MY SUGGESTION IS THAT YOU TAKE YOUR WIFE TO DR. ELLERTON IN PHILADELPHIA. DR. ELLERTON SENT ME TO YOU. OH. WELL, THEN PERHAPS STODDARD-- OR WEBSTER OR BOLAN OR ONE OF THE OTHERS. I'VE SEEN THEM ALL. I'VE SEEN THEM ALL, DR. RICHARDS. OH, NOW, DR. KING, I DON'T SAY THAT YOUR WIFE WON'T GET WELL. I'D GET HER INTO A WARM, SUNNY CLIMATE. SALTWATER BATHS ARE VERY GOOD, AND I'D KEEP UP THE THERAPY-- MASSAGE, EXERCISE. AND IF I WERE YOU, I'D-- I KNOW--PRAY FOR A MIRACLE. GOOD-BYE, DOCTOR. GOOD-BYE. GOOD MORNING. HEY, DIDN'T WE MEET YOU AT THE HOTEL DANCE LAST NIGHT? BECAUSE IF WE DIDN'T, WE CERTAINLY SHOULD HAVE. NO, I GUESS IT WAS SOMEBODY ELSE. SORRY. SORRY WE BOTHERED YOU. THE SUN TOO BRIGHT FOR YOUR EYES? LET'S GO HOME, TOM. GETTING LAZY ON ME, HUH? WELL, WE GOT A JOB TO DO. PLEASE, TOM, LET'S GO HOME. THE SUN'S SO HOT. THAT'S WHAT WE CAME TO FLORIDA FOR. NOW, LOOK, I TELL YOU, WE'LL WORK OUT MAYBE 5, 10 MINUTES. THEN I'LL TAKE YOU RIGHT HOME. I WANT TO GO HOME NOW! I DON'T LIKE TO CRAWL. IT MAKES ME FEEL SICK INSIDE, CRAWLING LIKE AN ANIMAL. I HATE IT! I KNOW. I KNOW, MARGE. COME ON, NOW. HERE WE GO. SEE, YOU GOT TO LEARN TO CRAWL BEFORE YOU CAN WALK. PUT ME DOWN, TOM! I WON'T DO IT! I WON'T DO IT! PLEASE, TOM. PLEASE. I WON'T. WON'T! NOW, WHEN A WAVE COMES ALONG, JUST LET IT PICK YOU UP, MARGE, AND PULL YOU ALONG, JUST KIND OF PUSH YOU FORWARD. THAT'S IT, NOW. LET IT WORK WITH YOU NOW, MARGE. ALL RIGHT, THERE'S A BIG ONE COMING NOW, MARGE. WORK WITH IT. LET IT HELP YOU ALONG. KEEP YOUR HEAD UP, MARGE. [GASP] PICK YOU UP TOMORROW, DOC--SAME TIME? YEAH, IF IT'S NOT TOO MUCH TROUBLE. IT'S ALL ONE TO ME. GOT TO DELIVER MAIL TO THE PIER ANYHOW. MIGHT AS WELL TAKE YOU ALONG. THANKS, JIM. I'M BEGINNING TO FEEL LIKE A POSTCARD. HOME IS THE SAILOR HOME FROM THE SEA AND THE HUNTER HOME FROM THE HILL. YOU SURE GOT AN EARLY START AROUND HERE THIS MORNING, DR. TOM, HONEY. IT'S THE EARLY WORM THAT GETS THE FISH. POMPANO FOR SUPPER-- THAT'S NOT BAD. NOT FOR THEM THAT LIKES FISH EVERY NIGHT. I'LL TELL YOU A SECRET, CLARA. IT'S A LOT CHEAPER TO BUY BAIT THAN IT IS TO BUY ROAST BEEF. HOW ARE THINGS THIS MORNING? NO BREAKFAST, NO CONVERSATION, DR. TOM. DON'T! THE LIGHT HURTS! IT'S TIME FOR THE BEACH. NO. I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE STARING AT ME. WELL, THEY DON'T MEAN TO OFFEND YOU, MARGE. ALL RIGHT, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO THE BEACH, WE'LL HAVE OUR WORKOUT RIGHT HERE. ALL RIGHT, MARGE. HERE WE GO. OH, THAT HURTS! TRY TO RELAX, MARGE. IT WILL HURT LESS. THAT'S A GOOD GIRL. JUST SAY, "I WILL WALK." "I WILL WALK"-- AND YOU WILL. SO ALL I HAVE TO DO IS WANT TO. DON'T, TOM! ALL--ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, MARGE. ALL RIGHT. BUT YOU'VE GOT TO TRY. OH, MARGE, YOU'VE GOT TO TRY. THERE'S A LOT OF LIFE LEFT IN THOSE LEGS YET. THEY'RE DEAD--DEAD. COULD ANYTHING BE WORSE? YES, YES-- USING YOUR ILLNESS AS AN EXCUSE NOT TO TRY. LOOK, MARGE, I'M YOUR HUSBAND. PLEASE, PLEASE LET ME HELP YOU. YOU'RE A DOCTOR. HELP ME TO DIE. [PLAYING OPERA MUSIC] TURN IT OFF. TURN THAT OFF! [MARGE SINGING] YOU WANT IT OFF SO MUCH, TURN IT OFF YOURSELF. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? TOM? COME BACK! I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU--NEVER! PLEASE, TOM, TURN IT OFF! [MARGE SOBBING] [MARGE GROANING] [MUSIC STOPS] [SOBBING] MARGE, YOU'VE DONE IT. MARGE, YOU MOVED. MARGE, YOU MOVED. OH, TOM. [MARGE PLAYING PIANO AND SINGING SCALES] CURDLES MY BLOOD TO WATCH YOU. IF YOU WEAR THAT COAT IN A STRONG BREEZE, THAT BUTTON WILL BLOW RIGHT OFF. WELL, THE COAT MAY GO, BUT THE BUTTON WILL STAY. I'VE SEWN PEOPLE TOGETHER WITH THAT STITCH. AND LEFT A LOOSE THREAD FLAPPING INSIDE OF THEM? OH, NO. SEE THAT? SAY, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. VERY SIMPLE. SEE? IT TOOK ME 4 YEARS TO LEARN HOW. I USED TO BE A LOT FASTER. I GUESS I'M GETTING KIND OF OUT OF PRACTICE. ONE OF THESE MORNINGS SHE'S GOING TO BUST INTO A REAL SONG. WELL, SHE BETTER HURRY.

WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE. DR. KING, YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT MEDICINE, BUT WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT SINGING WOULD FILL A LIBRARY. I DON'T HAVE VOLUME OR CONTROL YET, BUT THAT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME AND PRACTICE. FROM HERE UP, THE MUSCLES WORK FINE; FROM HERE DOWN, NOT SO GOOD YET, BUT IT'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT. I MAY TO HAVE TO USE MUSCLES NO SINGER EVER HEARD OF. I MAY EVEN USE A FEW YOU NEVER HEARD OF, BUT THE VOICE IS THERE. THAT'S WHAT COUNTS. IT'S STILL THERE. I'LL BE SINGING IN CONCERTS AGAIN BEFORE YOU KNOW IT. MRS. KING, I LOVE YOU... AND IF IT WEREN'T SO EARLY IN THE MORNING, I TELL YOU WHAT I'D DO-- I'D OPEN UP A BARREL OF BEER AND RIP THE ROOF OFF, IF WE HAD A BARREL OF BEER. NO LAW AGAINST CELEBRATING WITH COFFEE.

JUST AS PRETTY AS A PICTURE. [APPLAUSE] WELL, HERE WE GO. MARGE! WERE THEY ANGRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT? NO. I HAD TO TALK THEM INTO TAKING THE ADVANCE BACK. THEY WANTED TO KEEP A STRING ON YOU FOR LATER THIS SEASON OR NEXT. WE COULD HAVE USED THAT MONEY. DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT THAT. WON'T BE LONG BEFORE I OPEN AN OFFICE HERE, PASS THE FLORIDA EXAM. WAIT AND SEE, HONEY. WE'RE GOING TO BE RICH AND FAMOUS ONE DAY. I'M NOT A CHILD. I KNOW OUR MONEY WON'T LAST FOREVER. I'VE WRITTEN DR. BRUCE. HE OWES US SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS. THAT WILL CARRY US FOR A WHILE. TOM, I'VE LET YOU DOWN. NOW, COME ON. THAT'S NO WAY TO TALK. I'M VERY, VERY PROUD OF YOU, MARGE. YOU'VE GONE FARTHER AND FASTER THAN I'D EVER DARED HOPE FOR.

I THOUGHT OF THAT, TOO, BUT BY THE TIME YOU GET YOUR OFFICE GOING AGAIN AND FIND AN APARTMENT, IT'LL BE SPRING. YOU CAN SEND FOR ME THEN. YOU MEAN LEAVE YOU ALONE HERE? OH, CLARA WILL BE WITH ME. MARGE, THERE'S NO POINT IN DISCUSSING IT. TOM, COME HERE. I KNOW ONE THING NOW, THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS-- YOU REALLY WANT ME, JUST THE WAY I AM. I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE YOU ALONE, MARGE.

I DON'T KNOW JUST WHAT YOU MEAN. YOU MEAN THAT MARJORIE CAN WALK? NO. SHE CAN'T. OH, WE JUST PUT BRACES ON HER LEGS. IT'LL TAKE TIME FOR HER TO LEARN HOW TO--HOW TO USE THEM. I DON'T KNOW IF SHE'LL EVER WALK AGAIN. WELL, THEN HOW CAN YOU LET HER GO ON THAT STAGE TONIGHT? SINGING IS MARJORIE'S LIFE. TONIGHT, IF SHE'S REAL SUCCESSFUL AT THE METROPOLITAN, MAYBE THE REST WON'T MATTER SO MUCH. SUPPOSE SHE FAILS? CAN YOU RISK IT? WE'VE RISKED EVERY STEP OF THE WAY SO FAR. DO YOU THINK SHE CAN DO IT? SHE THINKS SHE CAN. YOU'RE QUITE A GUY. GOOD LUCK. CYRIL? COME BACKSTAGE TONIGHT. I'M SCARED TO DEATH. I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE, CLARA. I USED TO BE PRETTY GOOD AT IT. YOU'LL BE GREAT, MARGE.
