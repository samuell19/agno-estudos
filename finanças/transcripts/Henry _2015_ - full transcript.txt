-Good morning Well done! Quite outstanding dear boys. I will use this occasion to introduce you all to Henry. As of today, he is joining the school. Welcome him like a brother I have been told that he plays an instrument. The organ Let's have him show what he can do. Henry, if you don't mind? Go ahead Come, come! Get started. You're among friends here What's wrong? It was very good. Maybe he needs me to help him out. Quiet please. We can't have this. Leave quietly please. What are you staring at stupid? - You can put your shit back. - What's going on here? - We looked through his suitcase. You never know what a guy like that carries around Yeah, whatever. Come on, get changed. I haven't got forever. I have to show you the school. You'll take the bunk below me. Enjoy, he snores and farts like crazy. At least I don't piss the bed Get changed now No need to be scared. Pretty cool picture yeah? They're both in the same mess. The one on the right wins. What do you think? It's pretty big. Come on. - Good day. - Good day. - Can we help? - No Do you need anything? Put it back. I don't need it. What's your problem? Have a nice day. Yeah? You can sod off. Why did you arrive just now? School started ages ago. Did your parents forget to apply? We don't have to talk about it. That's Melanie, the headmasters daughter You can forget about her. Are you crazy? They'll chop your fingers off if they see you. Come on, get away from there. You have to earn it to play. I'm sorry, I had to collect my laundry. Two minutes Sebastian. How many squats will that be? Get on with it then. Ok, let's relax ourselves. The legs as well. And chew. I'm sorry. Where have you been? - Where is Eric? - I last saw him in gym class. He must have exhausted himself. Anyway, we begin without him. Get into position, take out the music sheets. We will start with the Tritsch-tratsch Polka Let's find out if we can get the alto right today Let's start. Here we go. Thank you Where have you been, if I may ask? Of course you may ask. You are the teacher. And? Eric? I needed to take care of something. And what was so important, Sir that it made you late for choir practice? Tell us Eric. We are all ears. - Would you really like to know? - Yes I had to get a quick blowjob. It took longer that expected. That's enough. You are always late. You leave the entire choir waiting. Everyone else were on time. And now you have an attitude as well? Get out of my choir -You don't mean that Who else should play then? Him perhaps? He can't even play Vivaldis' allegro and you know it. Take your things and leave Go straight to the headmasters' office. Come on I have practiced... I have had enough Are you crazy? Turn the music back on. It's punk Henry. It won't hurt you. Come on, let's play. Don't do it again Eric, please stop that. You're disturbing us. I'll be done soon I should hope so Would you please stop playing. It's enough for today. And the others want to sleep. - I'm not finished. - Don't torture yourself. You were brilliant in class. - Do I get to play for the choir again? - No Goodnight Goodnight - Is everything ok? - I'll be back, I just have to... Thank you, that's enough. Considering it's the first time you play the Andantino it flows pretty well. Today we will deal with the performance marks. What do you think Schubert had in mind? Look here, at the constant changes. Piano, pianissimo, piano, pianissimo Is that peaceful? No! That is unrest, an inner struggle. Something is boiling over, something wants out Something wants out, but it can't. And this struggle continues across these pages, until here. Until forzatissimo Here, the battle is over. And here... ...it has broken free. Henry, I don't know what happened. But.. ...we can be happy it's not worse. Alright We'll play the whole piece through. I'll lead one, two, three Eric, what are you doing? Bravo It's eleven o'clock. It's my turn. Where do you think you are going? You stay here. Understood? - What's going on? - Shut up Stay here, ok? Something might happen to you out there. From now on you'll sleep in the top bunk. Come on, go to bed. - Leave him alone. - Shut up. Stop it! Stop it Eric! Come down from there at once! It always has to be you, hasn't it? Yes, headmaster. Go pack your things. Your parents will come for you in the morning. Yes headmaster So stupid Eric, so stupid! Eric! Where is Henry? Come on, they always threaten to kick you out but never do. They won't kick you out. But now they have a replacement. They don't need me anymore. And what am I going to do? I have to share a room with a fatso and a mute. Great! But you get to be number 1. Like you've always wanted. Come on What are you waiting for?
