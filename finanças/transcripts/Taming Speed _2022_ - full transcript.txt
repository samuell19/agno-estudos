When experiencing speed, your body spurts adrenaline into your system. Your blood pressure rises instantly. Your heartbeat races, your body temperature rises, and your limbs start to tingle. This sensation is fascinating to some, frightening to others. Considering my old job as a grand prix driver, I fall into the first category. And Coulthard wins in Monaco! But I also know that speed... can have consequences. In any case, speed seems to come natural to Aksel Lund Svindal. Two Olympic gold medals, five world championships, 36 world cup race wins, most of them in speed events. But the question is, does being great in one category... give you an edge in another? And what does it take to tame speed? Should I...? No. Just clap? Okay. It's incredibly exhausting to be a top athlete, and maybe especially in high-risk sports. So I'm actually quite happy that I'm done. When I think about speed, I think that... the higher the speed, the better. And there's an intense rush. It's almost like you get a different personality in the minutes when you're competing. And you have the process of getting better and better. And I miss that a little. TEAM PRESENTATION STOCKHOLM PORSCHE CENTRE DANDERYD 6 DECEMBER 2021 -Hi. -Hi. -How are you? -Good. -How are you? -I'm good. This will be cool. That's the most important thing. Yes, it is. -You know all of this. -A little. -You know it better. -No, you're a downhill skier. So you know speed, at least. -Yeah, but you have to turn, too. -Not much. Ingemar Stenmark and Aksel Lund Svindal, welcome. It's a huge honour for us to have you with us here today. We are here today because both of these guys will drive Porsche Sprint Challenge Scandinavia next year. Let's welcome them, first of all. I've always been a fan of racing. It has fascinated me. I never thought I would ever drive a race. But it was really easy to say yes when I got the chance, precisely because there are some elements that are very similar to alpine skiing, and downhill in particular. I've never done this before, but now that we're doing it, I want to do it properly. First of all, the team is super professional. And we have two legends. Ingemar Stenmark is the alpine skier who has won most world cup races. Teammate number two is Carl Philip Bernadotte, who has raced for ten years. I can learn a lot from his experience. What's your goal? I think I will start out... -You're an athlete. You want to win. -I think I'll start out in the back. The goal is to get a little bit better all the time. I've only done one thing that's measured in hundredths, tenths, metres, and first, second and third place. I haven't tried to get good at anything else. Personally, it will be cool to see if I can get good at something else. That it's not just one thing and that I can get decent at something else, too. PRIVATE TEST, KARLSKOGA GELLERÅSEN ARENA A. LUND SVINDAL The first feeling when I got in and had to remember how everything worked was one thing, but the bigger surprise was the claustrophobic feeling of seeing too little. How can I operate the car safely without crashing? The pit lane is free. Go ahead and drive. There are so many impressions. It feels like your head will explode. You have to time everything perfectly. If you're going to do your best, you have to push your limits. And when you come into situations you haven't been in before, you lose control a little. You get scared, because you don't know how to handle the situations. That was the first lap. Great. The thing is, when you're in control, you can suddenly lose it in one tenth of a second. You need to get experience in order to know what's happening. I have a lot to learn. I'm at the limit. I make mistakes. I don't have a lot of experience. That's what we're going to practise. Let's look at the first corner. There are 30 metres there that we can work on. At the braking point. You have to get the car into the first corner and save those 30 metres, and then you have to hit the brakes harder. In modern racing cars, every single driver input is recorded, not unlike a black box in an aeroplane. The output is telemetry. Gear selection, throttle and brake application, outright speed, time gained or lost. Learning to use telemetry to your advantage is a powerful tool to improve, as well as a link between driver and engineer. By overlaying the telemetry from a particular lap with another driver, one can learn a great deal from all of the scribbles. The red lines represent one driver, the blue lines, his teammate. Their braking points are similar, but the blue driver carries more speed into the turn. Even though this causes the blue driver to exit the corner with a lower speed, the gain is a few tenths on the red driver through this section. Onto the start-finish straight, we can see that the blue driver gets on the gas pedal earlier and with perfect throttle control and balance gains just over 0.2 of a second on the red driver. Now there are options. The red driver can adapt and adjust the entry speeds and throttle inputs on exit, and the engineer can help by adjusting the setup. A bit of both might do the trick. They'll know the next time out on track. You're trying to find the braking point and brake later in the corners. You have to go full throttle until you hit the brake. It feels completely wrong to drive straight into a corner and just wait, wait, wait without braking. It's the balance between the right braking, the right turn in, and how much you should accelerate, and I haven't found that balance. It feels a little safer now, because I have tried the car in the environment the races take place in, and I have started to learn about the different settings. And... When you get more information, you can visualise what's coming, and then it feels safer or better. If you just practise, you'll be able to drive quite fast. It's hard to answer... how you become good, but... I don't think anyone stays at the top level for a long time without being the product of hard work. If you think you can do less and with lower quality than anyone else and still be better, I think you're fooling yourself. It can't be done. I think it's several small things. And when I say small things, I mean small choices you make all the time. It might be during practice or a competition or during a dinner with friends when you decide to go home early or you decide not to drink because you have to practise... If you have the will or the passion that this is something you want to achieve, I think the chances are greater that the choices you make will be good. And that doesn't mean good choices in life generally, but good choices for becoming a good downhill skier. OFFICIAL TEST, MANTORP MANTORP PARK, 28 APRIL 2022 This might get scary. I saw a video online, and there are curves here where you have to drive 150 kph. It's always exciting to do something new. Oh, yes. Morning. There's more throttle over the crest and a higher speed over the crest. After the crest, should I hold the brake a little or just touch the brake and then release it? Yes. And if you see there, you will brake soon after the crest, or maybe even on top of the crest, but you can brake even later, and as you say, it's just a touch to calm down the car. Try to stay with each other. Try to stay behind him and see his lines and braking. It might be hard to keep up with Carl Philip, but... In that case, I'll stick with Ingemar. You can go. Very good pace, Aksel. -That's good. -He's doing well. In alpine skiing, you will rarely achieve good speeds or a good performance if you're struggling a lot. You need to have a flow. If you're struggling against the forces of nature, you'll go slower than if you find a rhythm where you're at the limit but find a flow. Amazing, Aksel. Only three tenths behind Carl Philip. -Great driving! -Thanks. -Awesome! -Thanks! -That was great! -Damn fun! -Great, Aksel. -Thanks. This went well. You're an expert. I almost kept up with Carl Philip in the beginning. When we got new tyres, I got a confidence boost, so it felt better immediately. It's like having sharp edges on your skis. In everything you do, the higher the level is, the more demanding it is to get better. Just being able to do it safely doesn't require a whole lot. But being able to do it competitively requires a bit more. And being able to compete to win... requires a whole lot more, especially if you're competing to win every single time. In the beginning, you get a really fast progression with a low amount of effort, but at a certain level, the effort, the time and the difficulty level go straight up. It gets a whole lot harder. But you don't progress as much even though you spend a lot more time. It's hard to improve, and it requires a huge effort, both to become better and to stay at your current level. QUALIFYING PRACTICE, KARLSKOGA GELLERÅSEN ARENA, 5 MAY 2022 It's the last test day. And then we'll drive a race at Anderstorp. We have to get good at qualifying. Achieving one good lap and feeling when it's perfect and when to do the good lap, that's probably one of the most important things you do, and that's what we're going to practise. The pit lane is free. Go ahead. You're going to do ten laps. In alpine skiing, the differences are hundredths of seconds. And on the skis, you can adjust the angles of the edges. 0.3 degrees. 0.5. And then you have the stiffness of the skis, the width, the sidecut. There's a lot to test, and most of the time, you're testing tiny details. Some things feel good, and some things feel bad. If the difference is big, you'll know, but in the end, your time is the deciding factor. In a one-make series, such as Porsche Sprint Challenge Scandinavia, all cars look the same. But that doesn't mean they are the same. Golfers have different swings. Ronaldo is right-footed. Messi is left-footed. Rafael Nadal is right-handed but hits with his left. And racing drivers have different driving styles. A driver will have to adapt his style to suit the car or circuit, just like a tennis player would when switching from grass court to clay. But a race car also needs to be set up to get the car suited to the driver. The setup possibilities are basically endless. Wheel angles, throttle response, gearing, tyre pressures, roll bars, wing angles... I could go on. If a car is set up correctly for the circuit but not for the driver... Well, I'm sure Nadal can hit a tennis ball with his right hand too, but probably not as well. It all has to do with confidence. Confidence to push the car and yourself to the limit. When the equipment works perfectly, it helps make your driving technically perfect. Both in terms of how you move and in terms of the line that gives you the highest speed. The timing is right, and it feels... The equipment flows. I think I'm finding the setup that makes it a little hard to drive, but not so hard that I make a lot of mistakes. I think I've got it. The range is a lot smaller, and I need some small adjustments, but I think I've found a setup that suits me well. It's been both good and bad. I think the lap time in itself, if you put together different pieces, is very good, but what Aksel hasn't really managed is to unite the pieces in one lap, and that's going to be a challenge for him to do. In downhill, you have some practice runs, and on the race day, you only get one try. So it should be more similar to a qualifying than a race, but it took me about 20 years to get to the level where I know where the limit is and I can push it to the limit on that one try. But knowing where the limits are and being able to push them... I'm nowhere near that yet. RACE, ANDERSTORP ANDERSTORP RACEWAY, 14 MAY 2022 My name is Riccardo Ceccarelli. I am a medical doctor specialised in sport medicine. I've created Formula Medicine, which is a company nearly fully dedicated to motorsport. That's why now it's the leader worldwide. Every year, we see like 200 drivers. We train the drivers, and we assist the circuit in every category from go-kart to Formula 1. I was bringing some instruments for you. Okay? We can take a measurement of your stress. I was invited to assist and to work with Aksel. The challenge is to see how a champion from the ski can adapt to a car. What exactly will you measure? It's possible to see the heart rate variability, which is an index of the stress. It's possible to see the breath rate. And with some algorithm, we can have also like a kind of commitment. So what we try to understand is how much you have to put of energy, of commitment, in driving. Because the goal is the best balance between brain, body and car. So we say maximal performance with less energy consumption, because every time you think too much, you are slow. If you think too much at the point of braking, you become slow. I think I understand what you're talking about, because now, from just driving four days, I already feel that it's less stress and a little more automatic. So I can... It's easier for me to lift and look ahead. I can focus on what's coming more because this is happening more naturally. I assume that being in a race mode and having the right amount of tension and things like that are things that are comparable in alpine skiing and motorsport. So I assume that he will see some patterns that are good but also several things I will have to work on. Porsche Sprint Challenge goes over two days. The first day is the qualifying. On day two, there are two 20-minute races where the starting order is determined by the qualifying. QUALIFYING ANDERSTORP RACEWAY There's a lot to think about in qualifying. One thing is to find the right setup for the car. You have to feel the tyres and check that there's no traffic in front. Get the tyre temperature up, Aksel. It's time to push it, Aksel. You have time for three laps. At first, I was a little stressed because it was raining. But once I knew that I had three laps left and it was drying up and I had to get a good time, I just felt really focused. I was a little more in the race mode that I would like to be in. That's good, Aksel. P2, P2. -Yes! -Impressive! I knew I drove quite fast because I could see the times, but you don't know how the others are doing. But when I passed the goal flag, I heard that it was P2, so that was actually perfect. -Nice! -Congrats! Really good! I had three quite similar laps. I think it was your second-to-last lap. In racing, time is everything. It's a measurement of how well or how poorly you're doing. 0.2 of a second in the grand scheme of things is nothing. It's a blink of an eye. It's this beep. The average speed of the fastest lap in qualifying was 147.8 kilometres an hour. Aksel's was 0.4 kilometres an hour slower. A mere 11.2 metres if you look at the actual distance over the finish line. Not much considering the Anderstorp Raceway is slightly over four kilometres long. But let's complicate things a little. Being two tenths behind over a race distance of 20 laps, that gap will then grow to 5.5 seconds and 225 metres. Suddenly, 0.2 of a second isn't nothing. It's a significant margin. RACE 1 ANDERSTORP RACEWAY Welcome to Porsche Sprint Challenge Scandinavia 2022. The series that started last year is back in a new version with a new dream team with Aksel Lund Svindal and Ingemar Stenmark. Thank you. I'm nervous, because I've never done this before. It's the first time I'm driving a race. I'm especially nervous because I'm feeling really good. The practice went well, so I know that I can perform really well. -It's all okay? -I'm okay. I'm a little bit nervous, but that's normal. -It's how it should be. -Yeah. Has to be. Without adrenaline, it makes no sense. A little close now. Once the race starts, I think it's going to be tough. I've driven in traffic, but now, there will be cars all around me. That will be a new experience, so it's a little exciting. Go as fast as you can, Aksel. The first Sprint Challenge race has begun. Good start from Ludwig Ellhage. He tries to overtake Aksel Lund Svindal on the inside. Svindal hopes Kenneth Ahnelöv is in control as Svindal brakes past on the way down to the second corner. Great, great, great. Good. Svindal is back in William Siverholm's slipstream. He tries to overtake on the inside, letting the ABS work all the way. He squeezes past on the inside. A daring manoeuvre from Svindal. Great, Aksel! Amazing! Keep going! 2.30 left on Anderstorp Raceway for Ludwig Ellhage. Look at the car... Ludwig Ellhage wipes out in the second corner! Down from first place! Ludwig Ellhage! -That's great! -It's P1! Final lap. There are a few drops in the air. Aksel Lund Svindal in front of William Siverholm. One lap to go. A key braking point for Aksel Lund Svindal. He presses hard and makes no manoeuvre to move. A small blink from the headlamps heading down to the second corner. Siverholm is closing in on Aksel Lund Svindal. The final corner. He brakes as late as he can. The goal flag is in front, and Aksel Lund Svindal wins his first race in Sprint Challenge Scandinavia. Fantastic, Aksel! Yeah! -That was cool. -Damn great! Damn cool! P1! Yes! That was amazing! -It was a real fight, too. -It was damn great! Hey! I don't believe it's the first race. It's not the first race. Come on, tell the truth. You did already ten races. That was damn cool. -And it was a real fight, too. -A really good fight. Hey! Aksel Lund Svindal! Winning the first race was just perfect. Especially after all the action and the overtakings. Winning a race after a lot of fighting is especially cool. We'll have to wait and see. -Should we... -Yeah. The second race will be more difficult because it's difficult to get back to the focus. I'm trying. I told him it's like slalom with the second match, and normally, between the first and the second, you are completely focused on yourself. It's back to the focus, because he was very distracted by many things, so... -No problem. -Yeah. The lights are still red. And the race is on. Clean start with Janne Gustavsson on the inside. Aksel Lund Svindal has room to squeeze past. Svindal is on the outside. Krister Andero is far out and loses ground to Stenmark. He tries to overtake Ludwig Ellhage. Siverholm collides with Janne Gustavsson! Safety car, Aksel. Safety car. It will be exciting to see what Aksel can do. He had a fast car before this happened. The safety car is spinning laps. The cars are led into the depot. But not Aksel Lund Svindal. No, no, no, Svindal! What's happening now? What's happening? You have to get off the track. Svindal made a mistake. -You have to go into the depot. -Into the depot? All the cars follow the safety car, and when the safety car drives into the depot, or whatever the safety car does when the lights are on, you have to follow the safety car. Rookie mistake, but it's still really annoying. In my head, I just thought, "Restart, restart, restart." So I went from a complete focus on just looking ahead to feeling like I screwed up. I lost the race, and I also broke the rules, so it feels twice as bad. We're just running laps towards the goal flag, and we can declare that Kenneth Ahnelöv will win this race. -What a shame. -That sucks, Aksel. -It wasn't even a race. -No, it was nothing. I made a rookie mistake in the beginning. I think I just have to get more experience so I do more things automatically. I feel I've learned a lot this weekend. That doesn't mean I know everything. I probably only know 10%. But it was a big step to go from practice to a real race. -We'll take it. -Yeah. So now, when I go back home, I go to Formula Medicine with my crew. We will analyse all the data just to find the best suggestions to give to him, how to optimise his results for the next races. ANALYSIS AND MENTAL TRAINING VIAREGGIO FORMULA MEDICINE 11 JULY 2022 I think many of the same qualities you need to be a fast downhill skier are the same as when you drive cars and drive races. I think I have a good starting point. All right. Everyone has a different relationship with speed. As I say, either fear or attraction. When we train our brain to be faster, the speed is relatively less. So it's something that can be trained. We can analyse now the data coming from your race in Anderstorp. So, your first race. I can show you your heart rate and what the instrument gave me as a feedback of the level of stress. But the most interesting is, in my opinion, before the first race. You had a heart rate under 100. Before the second race, you were always around 100. I remember I saw you less focused. And I told you. You arrived late to change. You were more distracted. And then, when the safety car arrived, you did the mistakes. In my opinion, because it was more difficult to stay focused. It was more difficult to stay in the race. It is also, you know, a new situation. When you're driving, you think about only a few things. -Yes. You limit. -Exactly. And with the safety car, you think about many things. For me, it's important to have the awareness that the overthinking can be a stress, can be something that can cause tension and mistakes. That's what you learn as an athlete, sometimes. It's to find, you know, "What's my right tension level?" And you can control this yourself, but sometimes, it's much harder, because there's so much outside impulses, and then it gets much harder to control the tension level. The thing that impresses me is how much you are quick-learning. And I'm interested to see the same things in the mental gym, probably. -It makes me a little bit nervous. -I'm creating pressure. We will see. Exactly. You're creating pressure. Talent is necessary, but it's not enough anymore. So the prototype of the new athlete is just the person which is like an engineer before the action and then very pure instinct, an animal, during the action. For us, what is important is not the result, it's the feeling. The rhythm. Now you better manage also that one, in particular after mistakes. And again, we have this peak at the beginning from your heart rate. That's probably linked with the mistakes. We work like the engineer on the engine. More horsepower, less fuel consumption. We take the brain of the driver, and we train to give more horsepower, reducing the consumption, which is the quality of the champion. They are able to manage the emotion. They manage the pressure. They are not affected. So that's why they don't waste energy, because if I go to drive and I have many doubts, many emotions, many pressures, I'm not performing like I could do. If I am completely out of this pressure, I'm driving like I'm able to drive, so I perform like I can. So that is the difference. This is the mental economy training philosophy. Ready? Three, two, one, let's go. You learn about how you react, and if you get stressed, your performance drops, and how you can find a good mindset to do the exercises properly. What you learn about that is more important than the results. It's interesting what our analysis shows, because we saw that you are very analytical, very rational. You want to have the full control, and that means good analysis. You understand what to do, how to do, and then you can highly perform. This is what I have been thinking. That in general, but especially in skiing, that the one thing that I felt was a little bit different with me is that I was very analytical. And that means the first time I try something, I'm not so good, but then I analyse, and if I can practise a little bit, I can get much better pretty quick. The only thing that I can suggest to you... You should know your target. If you say, "I don't care what I do, I just go for driving", okay, but I think you're not that kind of person. You think that when you sit in a car, you want to be the first one. -I agree. -Yeah. Because in my opinion, what you show, you can have a chance to be professional in motorsport, depending on if it's your target now. I think many people, if they get the chance to practise, can reach a very high level. So I feel relaxed about that, but at the same time, it means there is a chance, and... when something is fun, it's exciting to play with the idea that there's a chance to do more of it. And just the experience I have got so far makes me ten times better equipped and prepared for it than I was six months ago. I think I did some of my best driving in Fällfors. I drove really well there. Carl Philip was better, but I placed second and third. Aksel Lund Svindal takes second place. Then we went back to Anderstorp. I drove well in the first race, so I placed fourth and seventh. After race number two in Anderstorp, I went to the doctor because I wanted to check something. But I didn't think it would be a big deal. But it was full alarm and straight to the hospital. It was testicular cancer, which is easy to operate, so everything happened quickly, but in the span of one week, I got the diagnosis, I got all the analyses, I got the surgery, and I was discharged. I was told quite early on that it was looking good and that the spread was minimal, and everything has gone well all the way. So I was lucky, but it was also a period that... puts your life in perspective. I didn't think I would die, and I understood early on that I would get through it, but I didn't know if it was a matter of weeks or months. So... I was lucky, and it took weeks, not months. During those weeks, I didn't think much about racing and driving cars, but on the other hand, I thought quite early on... This was about three weeks before the race at Rudskogen, and I needed something to look forward to, so I thought quite early on that I wanted to be there, almost no matter what. PRIVATE TEST, CARRERA CUP RUDSKOGEN RUDSKOGEN MOTOR CENTRE 17 SEPTEMBER 2022 I got the chance to test a Carrera Cup car, which is quite a big step up. What we're driving now is a race car. The Carrera Cup car is a brutal race car. I'm excited about how it's going to feel. If it's in a completely different league, so it feels really far away or if it's an idea I could play with and try in the future. The Porsche GT4 Clubsport is a fast race car. It's faster around a circuit than practically any supercar you might see on the road. But a 911 Carrera Cup car is, depending on the circuit, eight to ten seconds faster per lap than the GT4. And in a significantly faster car, everything happens quicker. You have less time to react, and you need to adapt. One key factor is to lift your eyes and look further ahead. Something that's easier said than done. When approaching a corner, an ordinary driver is looking for braking points and where to turn. A professional has already processed those inputs and is as focused on the corner exit and the one coming next. By doing this, the brain has more time to process and react to all of the information thrown at it. You start with braking and things like that. That's what creates the rotation as early as possible. Once you get started with the braking, the rest will follow. You'll get a good rotation when the braking technique is right. So just go ahead. It's cool to see Aksel drive around and try the GT3. It's a new experience. And of course to coach and help where I can to make his progression as fast as possible. This weekend, I'm driving Porsche Carrera Cup Scandinavia. It's always extra stressful to see the car I'll be driving being driven for the first time by a new driver. Very good, Aksel. The first lap is over. Good and even downshifts now. It's like there's no filter. Everything is rawer. The sounds and the feeling. The steering is more grippy. It feels more brutal, especially if it slips. There's almost no warning. Suddenly, you've just lost the grip. When you know it's like that, your heart rate is elevated and you're almost a little scared. It's a lot harder to lift your eyes and focus on the track and not think about everything that could happen to the car. You have to be more aggressive with a car like that because everything is faster. That's one of the biggest differences between a GT4 and a GT3. You have to push your limits with the grip you are given. -How was it? -It was... -Different? -It was a lot. -What was the biggest difference? -That it's a lot more nervous. -Very good start. -It went better... I was a little more confident the second time. #82 AKSEL LUND SVINDAL -How was it? -Exciting. I was almost... I was quite nervous, actually. What is it you say? It's a monster. We have seen how you've been driving this year, and you've been very fast. You've been in the top. That's not just about driving fast and safe. You have to learn to race against other drivers. But that's why this feels like a natural step. We would like to see if we can do more of this next year. But it has to feel right for you, of course. I think it sounds like a lot of fun, so... I think we should... We should keep thinking about that. QUALIFYING RUDSKOGEN MOTOR CENTRE If I want to drive Carrera Cup next year, I'll have to drive well. It won't look good if I don't drive fast in Sprint Challenge but still want to drive Carrera Cup. It would be perfect timing to drive well here and in the finals in Mantorp. Two, and then three. -That's good. -Yeah, we'll take that. We're at Rudskogen Motor Centre, Norway's own motorsport gem. It's the Porsche Festival with a huge crowd, and it's time for Porsche Sprint Challenge Scandinavia. -Can I get your autograph? -Sure. It was a little bit undercover that I would drive Sprint Challenge until I won at Anderstorp. Then it became a big deal that people talked about in the motorsport scene, and there are a lot of motorsport fans here, so I feel a bit of pressure. -Good luck. -Thanks. The race is on. Jonas is right behind Erik Sandell. Great start for Jonas Sjöström and Svante Andersson. But William Siverholm and an attacking Isabell Rustad are in the lead. Rustad, Siverholm, Svindal heading down the hill. William Siverholm fights against Isabell Rustad. Aksel Lund Svindal puts pressure on Isabell Rustad. Aksel has a great speed. This track seems to suit him. Svindal pushes hard and goes all in. Aksel Lund Svindal on the way over the line in second place. But he gets a penalty for a false start. He gets a five-second penalty which sends him down to fourth place. False start for Aksel. Five-second penalty. -You had a false start. -Did I? For real? Five-second penalty, so you came in fourth. -Really? -Sorry. I came in second place and thought it was a good race, and then they just waved me on. False start? I mean, I was behind Siverholm. It can't have been a false start. When you rolled forward, you moved to the side, like this. You can't cross your middle line before the lights are off. Okay, but can you show me a video so I can see how far over I was? It turns out that once you're in the starting field, you're not allowed to cross the middle, so you have to stay on your side of the track. And out of the corner into the starting field, Siverholm pulls slightly to the left, and like we've always done, I just followed him. You're over here already. Quite far in the other direction. You see that you're in your own field. The others are like this. But am I over here? I'm not. You're sure I was too far over? Do you have a better picture? No, I don't have another picture. I saw it myself live. Because when the race starts, I'm not over, right? No, but it's the whole formation before the start. -Yeah, but... -The big problem is here. But look at this... I'm not going to protest, but it feels quite unnecessary when no one has mentioned it all season and it doesn't give me an advantage and I'm... Unfortunately, with a false start, I can't judge whether or not it gives you an advantage. I'm a little annoyed. I think it's really unnecessary. It's annoying but mostly comical that it's suddenly a thing when we're nearly at the end of the season. RACE 2 RUDSKOGEN MOTOR CENTRE -I'm keen on revenge. -Yeah, right? -See you on the podium. -Yes. We're getting ready for the last Sprint Challenge race here. Great start for Isabell Rustad. Siverholm is right in front of Aksel Lund Svindal. Svindal dives into the first corner, but Isabell Rustad takes the lead, just like in the first race. Siverholm is on the outside of Svindal. Svindal pushed the line hard in the first corner. Aksel Lund Svindal's line is far from optimal. He loses Siverholm and Ellhage. Sjöström overtakes him too. Andero is Svindal's next threat. Svindal is a master of psychological warfare. He brakes really late and pulls in over the curb. Svindal gets a good run on Jonas Sjöström and overtakes. A slight oversteering, and Sjöström loses Svindal. What will Jonas Sjöström and Aksel Lund Svindal do now? Another contact. There goes Sjöström's radiator. Just as Svindal was about to shake things up. Jonas Sjöström is sliding around in his own coolant right now. I got hit. Flat tyre. Aksel Lund Svindal has a problem. His warning lights are on. The day is over for him. -I have a flat tyre. -Yeah. Did he drive into you? Or did you block him? No, he braked and hit me in the back. It's especially fun to do well at home, and it's especially hard to do poorly. -Can I take a selfie? -Sure. -How did the race go? -I crashed, unfortunately. Or someone crashed into me. Are we ready? Right now, I feel quite tired, but that's normal when you have a bad break. Especially if it feels like... you tried your best, but it just wasn't your day. I look forward to Mantorp. It would be perfect to finish with... a really good position. MANTORP MANTORP PARK, 1 OCTOBER 2022 It has gone by fast. It's been challenging but really fun. It has given me some competition nerves and the feeling of wanting to perform well, which I have missed, since it was an important part of my life. Great! -You're three and four. -Three and four? Yeah. Formula Medicine is visiting us this weekend. I'm curious about that, actually, because I have... I've wondered if I have an advantage because I was a downhill skier. I think I'm used to speed, and if you're used to speed, it's not as scary. You can tame it. So I'm excited to see the answers they give me. Welcome to the end of Sprint Challenge Scandinavia here in Mantorp Park in Östergötland. -The last day. -Yeah! Everyone is coming around. And we're off! Good start for Kenneth Ahnelöv. William Siverholm is squeezing past and touches Andero! Contact between Siverholm and Andero! -Carl Philip Bernadotte in the lead! -Svindal also has a poor start. Here come Svindal, Ellhage and Andersson. Sjöström is gone. Svindal is also forced to break. Something has happened to Sjöström and Svindal. Yes, it works. What happened? I got hit once here and once here. Look at this. Carl Philip Bernadotte wins the race at Mantorp Park. He flashes his lights, crosses the line and gets 25 points. Congrats. Good job. When I was an alpine skier, I was also disappointed and pissed off when I wiped out. It happens, but it shouldn't happen too often. Especially not twice in a row. So... That's a little annoying. But you can't do anything about it. Skiing is better because no one collides with you. That's true. In the last few races, I got hit twice and had a flat tyre. When you're skiing, you're all alone. -That's what I mean. -There's no one behind you. So sometimes, that's better, but... What do you think it's like to drive a regular car? It's hard to figure out how I should drive. But at the end of the race, I was harder on the throttle. This car has big back tyres and a lot of traction. But next season, you're driving Carrera Cup? It's not definite yet, but... You've been fast in those, so it's promising. It's easier with a proper race car that reacts more to settings and things like that. But since it's more direct, there's no filter. -Drive hard. -Good luck in the second race. It's time to decide this season of Sprint Challenge Scandinavia. It's going to be a spectacular and intense finish. It would be cool to get two people from our team on the podium. Keep my cool and drive a good race. The race is on. Janne Gustavsson is threatening Fredric Blank between Svindal and Siverholm, and there's a crash! Ellhage, Ludwig Ellhage, goes straight into the tyre wall. The safety car picks up all the cars. 6.5 in the brakes. What will Aksel Lund Svindal do now that the light is green again? Good start for Bernadotte and Gustavsson, leaving room for Andero. Svindal is overtaken by William Siverholm. Come on! Svindal overtakes Siverholm again. Down in the Paris area, Svindal bites back. Siverholm on the outside. This can't end well! And it doesn't for Siverholm, who drives onto the grass. Svindal comes up behind Gustavsson. He gets a better exit and overtakes Janne Gustavsson. Give it your all, Aksel. Janne Gustavsson is fighting Svindal for the last place on the podium. It's the final lap of this season of Sprint Challenge Scandinavia. It's tight! Prince Carl Philip wins his second race this weekend by a tiny margin, but he wins against Krister Andero and Aksel Lund Svindal. Come on, Aksel! -Yes! -Yes! Yes! Damn good! When we started this project, from thinking, "Would it be possible to participate", we soon started thinking, "Is it possible to win?" And it's cool when things go better than expected. I have confirmed that I am competitive, and even though it's not a world championship, when you do a serious job and the team does a serious job, a competition is important enough that you have to do your best. It was really cool to have you on the team. -I hope I'll see you again. -Just let me know. You're going to drive more, Ingemar? I can tinker a little, at least. It was cool to finish at P3, and especially when Carl Philip won because the mood in the team was so great, and both of us were on the podium. It was a good way to end the season. -Hey, Riccardo. Good to see you. -Ciao, Aksel. Nice to see you again. I was also, Aksel, analysing the data from my collaborators. From the data, I was comparing the first race and this race. You have, like, in free practice, in quali and race, making a comparison, you have ten bits less, which means saving energy. And also, the indicator of the stress is less. There are more moments that you recover, that you go not on the line of the stress, but you recover. So you have more confidence. You know better what you're doing. So there is an economy, an economy which is growing. Compared to the first race, you are more confident. You have better self-awareness. What it means to be a driver, not only a champion on the skis. Yeah, I mean, for me, everything is new, right? So in the beginning, it's a lot of input, and sometimes, it's like your brain is almost going to explode, and then, as the season went on, I think it felt... I mean, not completely natural, but a little bit more natural. And also, it's fun, because the more natural it feels, the more I also enjoy the driving. And the good is that you drive better, your performance is better, and this is exactly the feeling that you have driving. It's the one that we see in the data. Aksel is the confirmation. I can understand why he won. Apart from the talent, he has the right mental attitude of the champion, and that's for me a confirmation that top in skiing means you can be top also in another sport, especially if there is pressure, stress and difficulties, like motorsport. I feel that it's safe to say that this went better than expected. I can't imagine that there is something else that I have apart from a lot of experience with downhill skiing. That's what makes me unique, if I'm allowed to say that. That has to be the difference. It can't be anything else. -Now I have a question for you. -Yeah? What is the future now? I think there is a very good chance that I maybe step up into the Carrera Cup class next year, and that, of course, is a new challenge, a big challenge, but I think that's how you learn quickly, when you get new challenges. I have to say that it should be great, because it's a big step, but... This is an opportunity that I should seize. If someone asked me when I was 18, I would think it was insane. So 18-year-old Aksel, if I had said no now, he would have been pissed, because you can't say no to that. And I think it's a good confirmation that this is something that I want to be a part of when it's something you can look forward to when things aren't going well. If we have to answer if it's possible to tame speed, the answer is yes, because speed is a relative concept. It's not an absolute concept. So what the athletes of this age are able to do in skiing, motorsport, probably 20, 30, 40 years ago the human being was not able to do. The human being is always moving the limit, and that's also in terms of capacity to manage and control the speed, and this is how the sport, in my opinion, reproduces our characteristic, which is evolution of the human being. The more you keep high speeds and do things at high speeds, the more used you get to it. When you're going really fast without thinking about it, when you automatically look 50 metres ahead, the speed doesn't feel very high. Based on what I've learned this season, I believe with 100% certainty that it's possible to tame speed, but it demands a lot. And every time you reach a new level, it demands even more. Anything is possible, but the higher your level is, the harder it becomes to tame speed.
