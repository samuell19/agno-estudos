- Say dad, why isn't Alice coming with us? - She will join us later. - Oh no, I forgot my racket! - Then fetch it quickly. - I will! Alice, Alice! My racket! - Here, I thought about your racket. - Thank you. Why aren't you coming with us? - I will join you later. - Sure? - Yes, sure. Good-bye, dear. - Good-bye. - Enjoy your holidays. - We'll be waiting for you. - Have a nice trip. - Good-bye. - Good-bye! Good-bye! I LOVE YOU ALL - Mum! Mum! Mum! Mum! -Yes! Hello! Here. Hello, dear, how have you been? Look at you! - Presents! - What? No presents until tomorrow. Did the little one get her rest? - Yes, she did not sleep, but she's had her rest. - Ah, alright! Hello? - Hello, Alice? This is Patrick. I know you'll be mad, but I'm not coming. Look, don't get like that! If I come and it doesn't go well... You know me. I'm not sure I can control myself... You understand? If I drink more than I should, I can punch him again. It's Christmas Eve, Alice! - I am warning you. If you do not come and do this to your daughter, you are not going to see her for 6 months. - It's him, it's his disc. Could I get an autograph, please? - What is your first name? - Marie-Louise. - "Marie-Louise, a big kiss." - This is so mean! What are you doing there? - It was his idea. - It's genius. Now leave me. I have to get dressed, take a bath... Shit, my bath! - Was it Patrick on the telephone? - Yes, it was Patrick. - Why doesn't he want to come? Is he still afraid of me? - No, he is afraid of himself. It's been 4 years, this is ridiculous. - Why? If he still loves you? - Nonsense! Look, I am a bit on the edge and need to take my bath. Would you please leave me. Just leave me. - It's not very easy to see him again for me as well. - Look at the snow. It is so pretty! - Yes, it's beautiful. Look at the falling snow. It's simple, it's quiet. - Hey boy! - Mother, mother! It's Simon! Mother! - Damn! - Hello, is this Hotel de la Civeliere? Mr. Chabert, please. *- Yes, just a moment. - Hello, Claude? This is Alice. Are you alone? *- Yes, I am alone. *I was just going to call you. - I miss you. *- I miss you, too. This room is nice. Makes you feel at home right away. I did not know this hotel. In the Pariscope it said: "Comfort, luxury and discretion." And look, it's comfortable, luxurious and discreet. Shall we go? - Stop moving around, take a sit for a minute. - Alright, we sit down... we talk, and after that we go? - You ordered a bottle of champagne. - Right. So, I sit down, we talk, we drink the champagne and then go. - It was you who insisted on coming here. - Because I was certain you would refuse. - I should have refused. - No, no, it's fine like that. - What exactly did you expect? That we drink one glass and then we go? It was you who told me: "Let's have a glass in a hotel, it will be easier to talk." No? So, let's talk! - It was just an excuse. It's because I did not have the courage to tell you: "I want to hold you in my arms, let us find a hotel". It was difficult to spell out. - It was a smart decision, I would have said no. - There, I knew it. So much for that. You do not like me. I was certain of that. - Stop playing the fool. - Come in. The champagne. - Here you go. Should I pay right now? - Yes, please. - How much is it? - Together with the room, 320 francs, sir. - Here you go. - Thank you very much. Have a nice afternoon. - Thank you. You are right. I cannot stop playing the fool. When I like a woman, I play the fool. It's tragic. When I was younger and met girls I liked, I played the fool. So that they would notice me. Sometimes it worked. When we were alone. Naturally, whenever a handsome entered the stage, girls would leave with him. I would go back home, write poetry, odes, elegies... Incredible things. Would you like me to close the curtain, dim the lights, create an atmosphere? There. Curtains close... The atmosphere. There! Good. Before I take you into my arms and risk rejection, there is something I should tell you. -Yes? - It's been a long while since I last played the fool. And besides that,... if I do not hold you in my arms today, it won't matter much to me. I am not in a hurry. I seem like a sexual beast when I say all this, I know. But looks can be deceiving. What is important is that we get there. Here or someplace nice. What is important is that we are together. - This room is very nice. Now that you've created the atmosphere. - I really have to tell you something. But I can't here. -Everything ok? - Yes, fine. - Try this. - Yes, it's great. Add a bit of mustard. - I didn't put enough? - Add just a little more. - If you behave, tonight you will see Father Christmas, Marius! - But my name is not Marius! - Sure it is! Bygones be bygones? - Bygones. - Sounds great to me! - Hello, darling! - Look at you! - Where's my daughter? My daughter! - Hello, Alice. - My child! Come here! Yes, my little girl. - I heard steps. Did you hear it? - Yes, me too. - Who's there? - Father Christmas. - Do you think it's Father Christmas? - Yes, I know it. - He's carrying a basket! - A what? - A basket full of presents. - Does he have a present for mum? - This old man has lots of toys in the basket on his back. - Who are the presents for? What is in there? - Look at these little children. Come here. Come here. Whose shoes are these? - Mine. - What is your name? - Marius. - And yours? - Sofia. - And what did you ask Father Christmas to bring you? - An electric train, a Goldorak's costume and a Superman's costume. - An electric train… Here is the electric train. Yes, the electric train. And the... the costume of...? - The costume of...? - Superman. - Jerome, did you put your pumps there? - You didn't see me. - So what? You won't get a thing. You won't get a thing. So, you still believe in Father Christmas? - Thigh! Thigh! - She is already a musician. - Yes, my dear! Here is your thigh. There you go. Where did Marius go? Where is Marius? - I will look for him. - Only look at that! Such nice turkey. - I get the rump! - So, Marius, are you happy? What does Marius like? - He likes the white, like his mother! - Here, have a bit of purée, it's good. - I don't like it. - You can still eat a little, it won't hurt. - Marius is also your brother, dear. Yes! If he's my son, he is also your brother. - Damn, it's pouring! - You're coming or not? - Now look, either you change the room or I will. Your choice. - Why? - I need to be alone. - Am I bothering you? - I need some space. - Lady is blowing hot and cold. - It is what it is. I did not ask you which time you got back from the casino yesterday. Had fun with the croupier lady? - Is that what it's about? - No, it's not. It's everything. I'm suffocating! - Black Jack. - Place your bets, please. - I was looking for you. - I was waiting for you. - Alice? What's wrong? What's wrong? - It's over. It's over, Julien, I don't love you anymore. I wanted to wait a bit before I told you this, but... I couldn't take it anymore. - Are you sure? - Sure about what? - Is there someone else? - Yes. - How long? - Since a few days. - Few days? - Where did you meet him? - In a bookstore, but I had already known him. - In a bookstore? - In a bookstore or... pushing a car in a rain, what does it matter? - That's true, what does it matter? Still, it's more romantic. - If you will. - I shouldn't be surprised. 4 years I waited for this moment. But it hurts. - Julien... - I warned me, so I shouldn't act surprised. It shouldn't hurt the way it does. - Close the window, I am cold. I'm cold. I am not a big optimist, you know. I believe that sometimes we are made for someone, in a dazzling way. When we meet them, everything is great, everything is obvious. Unfortunately, it does not last. If one day I feel that this is over, or it's you who feels this way, we should tell each other about it. - We are not going to start thinking about the end, are we? - Are you looking for something particular? - No. - Do we know each other? It seems like we do. - Yes, we do. You had a bookstore, Lanneau street. - Yes, I still have it. And you were looking for the old Noires (Noir fiction) series. - Blême (Crime fiction) series, yes. - Yes, that's it. Hello! How are you doing? - All is well. And you? - Life goes on and cannot be stopped. - What did he say to you? Did he make you laugh? Is he funny? - Stop torturing yourself. - I would have preferred to never have met you. You will end up alone, Alice. - You're hurting me! I'm scared of you! I don't want you to touch me. - You don't want me to touch you? I'm touching you now! And? - I'm scared, I don't want you to touch me. - I am touching you. - Let me go! - I fucked you as well, no? Slut! - You really are pathetic! - Yes, I am pathetic. - Yes, you are pathetic. How could I have loved someone like you? - With your pussy! - I can't stand you! I can't stand you, I hate you, do you hear me? How could I have wanted to have your child? I want to die, I can't take it anymore! - OK, go on. Go on, off you go, you're not able! Go on, die. Die! Die! Me, I am an artist. I don't need anyone! Go on, go on, die. Die! Fuck you! Drop dead for all I care. You're busting my fucking balls. There, now go, chop-chop! Swallow all the pills you want... - You are disgusting! - Yes, that's it. Obviously! I did not see a thing. Yes, yes. - Stop playing! Stop! - I hate you! - I hate you. - Get lost. Disappear! - You are revolting. Really revolting! Can't hear you! - Stop playing already, shit! Stop playing! You really are pathetic, you know? You really are pathetic. - Shit. Oh shit! More shit! "I snore, I snore, cause you're a bore." Huh, it rhymes. "I snore, I snore, cause you're a bore." "I snore, I snore, cause you're..." Where are the bottles? Can't even get drunk in this shack. Where are the bottles? Do not answer all at the same time. Where are… Ah! What are you doing here? - I couldn't sleep. - Because he snores as well? Ah, there you go! And a little scotch for Father Christmas! You want some? - No. - A big one. What's wrong? - Everything's fine. And you, you didn't sleep? - I snored like a bear and she woke me up. This way we were both awake. She is happy, she won. At least my snoring did not bother you. - Not with the ear plugs, no. - No, no. Not at the beginning. When you loved me you did not use ear plugs. - At the beginning. But at the beginning people do not sleep. - Did you love me long? For how long did you love me? - I loved you all the time. Until the end. - No, answer honestly. I wanted to ask you this for a long time. - But it's the truth. I loved you until the end. - So you loved me? - Yes, I did, I loved you. I do not understand why you are doubting it. - Not just for Sofia? - No, not just for Sofia. I wanted to have your child. - Yes. It was me who asked you. Miss, I haven't known you very long, but… but I would like to have a child with you. - Are you sure? - Absolutely. Shall we make one right now? - A girl then. - A girl? If you want. Let's go. - Will you let me have a cigarette first? -No! No, you shouldn’t smoke if you are expecting a baby. - I'm not pregnant just yet! Stop drinking. You drink too much. - If you quit smoking, I'll quit drinking. It won't be a doctor delivering this baby, it will be firefighters. You will smoke the baby out! - Drunkard! - Do you remember the first time we saw each other? The first look? - Yes. You played with your eyes closed. - And the moment I opened them, I saw you. - Shot by Cupid. - Shot down, more likely! - So, this is what I wanted to tell you. I'm a widower. I lost my wife 8 months ago in a car accident. I could have told you this afterwards, but... I did not want to bullshit you like this. Besides, the hotel room did not seem like the right place. At the same time, I don't know why, before holding you in my arms, I had to tell you this. So there it is, I said it. We don't talk about it again, and.. we can continue seeing each other. I can even play the fool. Let's go, Julien, we are going to be late, please. - Coming. Just let me take a quick shower, I'll be right there. - You could say hello, by the way. - Hello, mum. What time does dad get here? - I think he said this afternoon. - Sounds like the last time! "This afternoon". I waited for him the whole day. - No, I believe he will come. Change your t-shirt, you played tennis. What did you brush your hair with? - Not with a mop, obviously! With a comb. - You didn't brush. - Maybe not that part. - Go. - Will you join us? - Yes, later. - "Yes, later." - Yes, I'll join you. - Alright, OK. Tell Julien that I'm waiting for him downstairs. - Fine. See you. - This one's not bad! What is it? - This is women's clothing. - Women's? - Women's yes. - It's not bad. - It will be too small for your size. - You think? - It depends, looks like it can protect me from wind just fine. - Look. See, looks a bit like… Henry II doing winter sports. You don't like it? Don't find it nice? I could do Olympics in that. - You're not serious? - I am. Just can't zip it up. It's not bad. - The zipper is not the problem! - Ready, steady, go. - Look, listen… - It's good. - You're not serious. - I'll take it. You're coming tomorrow? - Yes, I am. - How? By train, by plane? - I'm coming. - Continue! I think butt... I think butt... I think butt... Butt Hounds on a leash Bastards without pedigree I think butt Butt I think butt But Give me your little paw Suck this sugar, good girl I think butt Butt I think butt Butt Butt I think butt - Hang on, I still had a few more questions. Ah, yes, when you say that women are like dogs, is this a compliment? - Absolutely. - For dogs? - You're stupid or what? For women. - Did they hurt you a lot? - I've been badly bitten. Had stitches all across my face. All across my ugly mug. - You think that you have an ugly mug? - You don't? I got used to it. When I was young, I used to hide it under a hat, but now... - It did not stop you from achieving success. - Women like being scared. It excites them. - There must have been something else though. - Let them come to me, these little sluts. - Real love just doesn't happen to you? - And you? - To me it does. - Was this interview your idea, or did your tabloid just send you here? - It was my idea. I wanted to get to know you. Do women break up with you? Or is it you who does it? - With my big snout I can sense which way the wind is blowing. When things turn sour, I pack my bags. And retreat. - What is the first thing you notice in a woman? - It depends. If she is sitting, the eyes, the mouth. If she is standing, the back… What are you doing? Do you have a car? - No. - OK, I'll drive you. - Hello? Who is speaking? *- This is Claud speaking, a friend. - Yes. Mum, there is a mister for you. - I'm will be right there. *- And what is your name? - Sofia. - Coming. Thanks, dear. Hello? Hang on. Go help Nejma set the table downstairs. Leave me for a bit, dear. Close the door. - Who is it? - A friend, go. Off you go, dear. Close the door and help Nejma. I'll see you soon. - Hello? *- Hello, it's me. - I am glad you called me. All good? *- Yes. - Even better. I couldn't anymore, I told him everything. *- How did it go? - Bad, very bad. *- Still, tell me. - I don't want to talk about it on the phone. I will meet you tomorrow. I'm taking a plane and will arrive at 10. How will we find each other? *- I will pick you at the airport. * Unless there's a problem with Thomas, but I don't think so. *You sound strange. *Something's wrong? - No, I'm not strange, just tired. Everything is so complicated. Perhaps it's me who complicates things. See you tomorrow? -I want to see you. *- Me too. - Kiss you. See you tomorrow. *- I kiss you too. - Is there anything left, Nejma? - Yes. - Because I would like some. Thank you. Look at Max, he won't say no! - Alice, won't you wake Simon up? - I will. I am going to make him a coffee. - Thank you, Nejma, really. Finally something other than pineapple chicken. I'm just joking! - I am eating in small bites. - Small bites, good for you. Say, Marius, what are you going to do later? What are you going to do when you grow up? National police not for you? Your mum would've liked it! - Why would I have liked that? Nonsense! - Nonsense! - Nonsense! Nonsense! - Go get some yule log. - Yule lock. - LOG! - It's really tasty. She wants some. - Yes, it's really good. - Well done, Nejma. - Wake up. It's 6 o'clock. Wake up, it's 6. -Leave me the fuck alone! Close the curtains! Close the curtains, goddamn it! - Absolutely not, you'll go back to sleep. I've had it living with an owl. -You annoy the fuck out of me. Do I do this to you when you sleep? Huh? - I sleep at night, there's a difference. - Like all idiots. - I am not going to spend my life watching you sleep. - In this case, sweetie pie, try writing songs, it will keep you up. - You're nothing but a Gitanes smoker. "God is a smoker of Havanas" by Serge Gainsbourg God is a smoker of Havanas I see his grey clouds I know he smokes even at night Like me, my darling I'm just a smoker of Gitanes *No, it's not working. I'm not feeling it. - What's not working? *-I'm not feeling it. - Go on, keep singing! *- If it doesn't bother you, I would prefer... *"You're just a smoker of Gitanes"! *"I'm just a smoker of Gitanes" is too obvious. - You can use that, if you want. *-I've been telling you from the start that it's a duet. "You're just a smoker of Gitanes". - "Seeing your blue curls." *-It's perfect. - "sometimes brings tears to my eyes." - There you go. -Come here. - What? - Hit it. - You want me to sing? What's he doing? You're just a smoker of Gitanes Seeing your blue curls sometimes brings tears to my eyes You are my master after God - Good. Let's listen it. - How was it? - It's perfect. - No! I'm going to listen now. - Perfect. That's right. You're just a smoker of Gitanes Seeing your blue curls sometimes brings... - Sometimes? - ...tears to my eyes You are my master after God - Memories, memories... - You're just a smoker of Gitanes Without them you are wretched In the moonlight open your eyes For the love of God - God is a smoker of Havanas So close to you, far away from him I would like to keep you all my life Understand me, my darling - You're just a smoker of Gitanes And I want the last one to reflect deep in my eyes Love me, for God's sake - God is a smoker of Havanas So close to you, far away from him I would like to keep you all my life Understand me, my darling - You're just a smoker of Gitanes And I want the last one to reflect deep in my eyes Love me, for God's sake - Careful, you'll cut off my ear. - Stop moving then! - Does this make you laugh, dear! You want mum to cut off my ear? - What? - Yes. You want mum to cut off my ear? -No! - I am for little Agathe, this is the latest If there are other candidates, I am a true democrat I accept undershots, I am for primates For girls who scratch themselves, for permanganate! I like those with sweaty palms, those who become dehydrated These are the ones that explode best at 200 watts I like the broods in the wadding who like to be beaten With fists, with battens; those who find it swell! The expanding Schleu, foie gras and spleen The Englishwoman who say "what?" when you make fun of her I am for those who try it when afterwards I dismast I am for centipedes and for acrobats! I am for little Agathe, this is the latest If there are other candidates, I am a true democrat I accept undershots, I am for primates For girls who scratch themselves, for permanganate! - ANOTHER ONE! ANOTHER! ANOTHER! I am empty. I need others for their words. They give me stupid songs, so I sing stupid songs. If they give me good songs, I will sing good songs. - Still, you could choose. - Yes. Yes, I could make a choice, but I don't have a choice. I need to sing, I need to let steam off. Without music I might as well roll over and die. Before this I screamed into my saxophone, now I yell into the microphone. But I need others for their words. - One day you will find your own words. Of that I am certain. It takes a lot to scream like that. This is not a void talking. - I need you. What did you do, Sofia? What did you do? - I am cutting her hair. - Well, she's going to look pretty after that! - Say good-bye. - Good-bye! See you tomorrow. - Bye! - Mum, there's a call for you. Mum! Mum, there's a call for you. - I'm sleeping. I'm sleeping. - Alice, I'm leaving. I am taking our 4 years of happiness with me. They will always be ours. We will reunite, I'm sure. But right now do not try to join me. I need to calm down. Tell the kids that I went to America for work. That I will be back in a few weeks. Tell Jerome that I will be there for his game. The only thing I regret is telling you yesterday that I would prefer to never have met you. Take care. Julien. - When's the next year? - In 2 days, my dear. Eat. - Why did Julien go to America? - It was for his work, my dear. - Will he be there the next year? - Surely. Well, maybe. - Julien is lucky, me too, I would like to go to America. - You will. One day, when you grow up. You're not eating, Jerome? - I'm not hungry. - Then go to bed. Jerome, I know that you are mad at me and that you think it's all my fault. I ask of you, even if it's hard to do, to understand that I cannot get my life right in one shot and that I am the first one to suffer from this. I would also have preferred for everything to happen differently. I would have been happier. My life is not a complete success. I am aware that I made you bear the weight of my mistakes, despite not wanting it. I know how attached you are to Julien and the sorrow you are feeling. I implore you, do not add your sorrow to my pain. Be strong. Perhaps one day you will understand me. Do not judge me. Your mother who loves you. - Hello. There you go. Thomas, may I present Alice. Take off your glasses, say hello. - Hello, Thomas. Hello. Isn't this lovely! The weather is just beautiful. - In Paris the weather is horrid. - Where did you meet her? - Flea market. She came to buy my books, and we became friends. - You're married? - No. No, not really. - So, you don't have children? - I do. I have two children. A little girl, younger than you, and a boy, much older than you. - So, you're not married, but have children? - Stop with your questions, enough. One can easily have children without being married. I think you need an ice-cream. Go get one. - I don't want it. - Well, I do. Go get one for me. - Go get it yourself. - Is that how you talk to your father? You will now say you're sorry, or you're going back to Paris tonight. - Sorry. - Sorry who? - Sorry, dad. - Give me a kiss, come on. - Say, dad, will you go get me an ice-cream? - It's true that he gets to me and he uses it. He pisses me off. But I was not prepared to become a mother. We are made to be a father or a son. It's rare to be both at the same time. I used to be a son. I adored my father. And just like that, instead of being a so-so dad I was expected to become a doting mother, a mother hen. - I don't like separate beds. - It was the only room left. I cannot sleep here the whole night, because if I'm not there when he wakes up, he will understand. - You sleep together? - Yes. - In the same bed? - Yes. - You must have a large bed then? - A large bed, yes. - I find this perfectly unfair. - This son. All this is quite unexpected. I thought I was more capable to appeal, to be in love. - I was starting to believe that nothing would ever happen to me again. - And now you're starting to believe that something is happening? - Yes, I think. - How can you even like me? Did you see my face? - You are right, we need to be careful. - We need to be careful. - Come on, keep up! Try to catch it! - Come on, Thomas! - Cheater! Cheater! - Give it back this second! - Dad! Dad, look, I'm smoking! - Give me back the cigarette! If I catch you, you're getting spanked. - You smoke? Quit smoking right now! Thomas! He's crazy. - He took my cigarettes! - You may not take the cigarettes. - There's a roll And there's a pitch - Come on, everyone! - There's a roll And there's a pitch There're heavy blows And there're storms But we're no wimps so we are happy Like fish in the water. - Come! - Mama, come, it's fun! - Careful now! - There's a roll And there's a pitch There're heavy blows And there're storms But we're no wimps so we are happy Like fish in the water. - Have you already made magic? - No. - Now, look. I am going to give you big scissors, and you'll watch them carefully. Pay attention to the scissors. Now, you are going to cut the ribbon in the middle. Go on, try to cut it in one go. Can we get some applause? Well done! There. Now, look. We are going to put the ribbon back together. You think it's possible? - Yes. - Yes? You think it's possible? Yes? You all think it's possible? -YES! -No! - Zip it. - You count to three. - One…. - Two... Three. Now blow! Look, it's mended! Can we get a very loud applause? Bravo, Sofia! - Did you see, Sofia was fascinated by the ribbon. The eyes she made! She really liked it. - I feel good. I wish this could last. - Why shouldn't it? - Because. It doesn't last. - So, you're happy, feeling good? - Yes, very good. - Then don't think about tomorrow, don't think about what's next. - I can't stop myself. I'm a terrible bore. I feel like I'm in a moving train. I always want to jump off. - I know what I'm going to do. I am going to attach you. This way you won't jump off your train. - Really? You think it's a good solution? - You didn't understand. You will get attached to me. Very, very, very attached. Very, very, very attached. - I like it. - I know one! I know one! Why is there so much shit in front of the stores in Belgium? - I don't know. - Go ahead. - Because it says on the door: "Push hard". - Nice one, especially for the dessert, Gives you an appetite. - I have one more, but it's a wordplay. So... here goes… Why does it help to stand in a corner of a room when you get cold at home? Those corners are around 90 degrees. - There's just one yogurt left, but there were 4 an hour ago. Who ate them? - It was me. - You ate 3 yogurts? - Yeah. - What about the others? - There are still some petit-suisses (French cheese), no? - You could have eaten them as well, while at it! - No one wants the yogurts anyway. - I hate them, can't stand them. - Not the end of the world. So he ate the yogurts. We are telling funny stories here. - Don't cry, baby I'll put my costume on And fly across the globe I'll visit boys and girls And bring them lots of toys Boom! Here comes papa Nono I'm climbing down the chimney My bag is always with me - How do you manage to write this crap? - It's not crap. It's a Christmas song for Patrick. - And this makes sense how? - Really? He will sell about 300 000 discs. - I'm not talking about money. - And I am. By wring this crap I stay independent and we have never had to discuss money. No. Find yourself someone whose songs are less crappy. - It was me who said a crappy thing. You won't get mad because of it? - I'm not mad, just disappointed. That's all Don't think that I do not welcome criticism. On the contrary! But you could have spared me that one. - Please forgive me. - Oh no, I'm not your mother. - Why? Only children ask for forgiveness? - Come on, everyone's having fun. - That's great. - It's the last day when we are all together. - I need to finish doing kid's things. - You'll finish tomorrow! Come, they will be glad. - Next time I tell Jerome off and you disagree, wait till we are alone to tell me that. - You're not going to make a scene because of 3 yogurts? You won't see them for a month. - He's too selfish. - Come on, don't sulk, let's go. Come on, let's go. I won't leave you alone. I'm afraid you'll jump off the train. You won't jump, right? - I'll be right there. - Leave all that, come on. - Coming. - Why don't you want it? - Stop it! - Once every two months is not enough for me. - I'm not stopping you from going somewhere else. - But it's you I want you, you hear me? - Stop it! - Want me to take you by force? - No need, go ahead. I won't move. - Alice. But I love you, Alice. You understand? I want you. I want to be inside you. You hear me? Why? - Why what? - Why don't you want it anymore? So, what, is it over between us? - Physically, yes. - Huh? So what's left then? Will you shut up? Say, how long has it been? How long has it been? You're not normal! - Possibly. - But… I know. I should have never agreed to have this child. It's my fault. Will you shut up? Will you shut up? Will you shut up? - You're out of your mind? No! You're insane! - Sofia! Sofia! Sofia, come out, I saw you. Sofia, come. Come out, I saw you - What did you do? - What did she do?! - I did not see it! - What did she do?! Where was she? Where was Sofia? Come here, my beauty! Why did she do it? Sofia! Look what she did. - Don't get her hair wet. - Oh no! What did you do? Why did you push? Why did you push? - Stop! - Want more? Go, go, go! Swim, swim, swim! Sofia, my beauty. You're a slut! Wanna know who you are? A real whore. Know who this is? A slut. Look at her. A slut! You're a slut. Look at her, just look at her! Whore! - This time it will cost you dearly! - How much will it cost me? You hear? How much do you take for a night? - Let me go, you hear? Leave me alone! I do not belong to you, you hear? You don't own me. - I have the right to love you. - No, that's not for free. - See? What did I tell you? You're a real whore! - You really are pathetic. Drunkard! - Kiss me. - Stop it, I've had enough! - To hell with you! We have a train to catch! - Yes, but still… - Let's go, goodbye!! Say goodbye, Claude! - Hey there! - Goodbye! - We're going to kiss Sofia, wait. - Quick, we have a train to catch. - We shouldn't miss it. - No, we really shouldn't. - Are you listening to me? - Yes, go on. - Make sure she doesn't go to bed too late! - Yes, we'll be on holidays, it will be great! - Check if she takes her covers off at night. - Yes, I will, rest assured. - Hello, goodbye. - Goodbye. Say goodbye. Goodbye, goodbye. Goodbye, children, quickly. - Behave on the train! - Yes, bye, Claude. - Have a nice trip. - I did not finish packing her suitcase. I did not pack your suitcase, dear. - It will be fine, come on - Two secs, I just need to add two things, I'll bring it to you. - We'll finish packing and we'll be on our way. - Why all of a sudden like that? - Because it's holidays! -Hey! -How are doing? Jerome! Your father is here! Will you have a glass? - No, there's a taxi waiting. - You came in a taxi? - Yes, I had to sell my car. - Where are you taking him? - I'm taking him to Beaulieu, to an old friend. You alright? - Yes. Make sure he doesn't go to bed too late. -How have you been? -All good. Where are we going? - We are going to Haute-Provence. - Where's that? - Far away. Are you already fucking a little? - There he is. Don't forget to write! - As always. - Don't let him go to bed too late. - What? - Don't let him go to bed too late. - You're joking? I promise, I swear. - Alright, I count on you. Have a lovely trip! - Come on, shit! You're no good! What are you doing? Watch out, go, push, push! Come on now! - That's it, I got it! - A glass of Vichy, please. - Me too. I need one more. - I'm not feeling well, I would like to go home. - What's wrong? - I think I am pregnant. - From who? - Hey, Simon! Your turn. - One more round and we go, ok? - Take your time. You're driving in the wrong direction. - I don't care. You didn't understand? I was joking. I was joking! - I'm fed up with your jokes. I'm fed up with hanging out God knows where with God knows who. To me, this is not life. - I need to mess around to write my songs. People like what I do because I don't give a damn about life! Some sing of hope while boring themselves to death, and I sing of despair while having fun. - Go have fun with another woman. - But I want to bore myself death with you. - I want to get out. - Stay there. - I feel sick. - Stay there! - I feel sick! - I've always wanted a little girl. - Another time. - The culprit is you If you're in this mess, it's your fault The culprit is you the harm you did to me, you will pay for it The culprit is you Today, you're crying, but don't blame yourself The culprit is you you owned me You won't get me twice The culprit is you I promise you, my little one, that you will bite your fingers The culprit is you Shouldn't talk about love etc. The culprit is you - Why didn't you talk to me sooner? Why didn't you tell me? - I did not dare. I was weak. I didn't lie to you for long. - No, I don't want to talk about that. What I mean is, when things were going well, why didn't you tell me? I don't know… I would have dropped everything. We would have gone on a trip, we would have loved each other again. - We would have postponed the end for a few weeks. No. I didn't tell you because... I was hoping it would work out. But here, in everyday life. Not on a trip. To me, it's still a mistake. - Let me love you differently. Let me love you tenderly. - But you do love me tenderly, Julien. Where are our dates? Our first dates. - But love evolves, Alice. Now we have a date every day. - At the same time. It's not love for me. I prefer to suffer I prefer to hurt, but love, I need to think about it. I need uncertainty. I can't love every day at the same time. - I still want you, Alice. - Alice! Alice! Thomas, go get Alice. Call Alice. - But I'm hungry! - Exactly, if you call her, you'll eat sooner. - Alice! - A little batavia fresh from the garden, please! That's beautiful! Oh damn! - Taste it! I'd say quiche is your calling. She has graced us with her presence to eat the quiche! - No, I'm leaving. - You leave? Where do you go? - I had everything ready. - You will eat without me. - Where are you going? - She's going out. Sit down. Give him a piece of quiche? We're going to play dominoes now. You're happy? - Awesome! - I won't be late. Nejma will do the dishes tomorrow morning. - Wait, I'll see you out. - Go on, eat. - This outing wasn't planned, was it? - No. I phoned a friend, I wanted to go out. - Why didn't you ask me? Don't forget we're leaving tomorrow. - I won't be late. - Won't you kiss me? - It's not urgent, it can wait until tomorrow. Is there a place left on the charter to Palermo? - There are still places. - I have to go. If you could come earlier tomorrow, I would appreciate it. I'm sorry, it's a nightmare with all these strikes. You're hungry? - No, not really. - Good evening, Mr. Xavier. - Good evening. - Could we get something to drink? - What would you prefer? - I would like a whisky mixed with Perrier. And you, Alice, what will you have? - Same thing, on the rocks. - Shall I bring it to your room? - No, we will have it in the lounge, thank you. - Oh no, I liked it better before. - It was better before, Mr. Xavier. Would you switch it off, please? Thank you. He's worried, he's not used to seeing me with someone. - So this is where you live? - Yes. It is convenient. I travel a lot now. When I'm not here, I leave my things in a suitcase, to the concierge. When I get back, I always have a room. I'm free. I am glad to see you. Last time I wasn't in top shape with my hay fever. So you're alone? The children left on holidays? - Yes. Both of them left this afternoon. - And you did not go? - I will. I'm leaving tomorrow. I felt a bit lonely, that's why I called you. - You did well. You were lucky to catch me. If it weren't for this strike, I'd be in Ireland. I think I could leave tomorrow morning. - Would you perhaps like to get some sleep? - No, not at all. - You like Ireland a lot, don't you? - Yes, I love it. I organise caravan trips. - Caravan? - 11 miles a day. Do you know that Jerome beat me the last time? - Yes, I know. When he came back, he was beaming. Did you do it on purpose? - Not at all. I played the best I could. He was in a great shape, so he beat me, I assure you. He grew up, right? How is Sofia? - Good. Very good, thank you. I am glad to see you. - Me too. You're alright? - Yes. Health is good. I wanted to see you. I needed to talk to a friend. Perhaps I shouldn't have. - No, on the contrary. Your friendship is very important to me as well. - It's still the best thing about me. I'm thirsty. I would like to drink something else. - What would you like? - Something refreshing. Champagne? - Yes. - It's late, he should probably go to bed. - Would like him to bring it to my room? - Yes. - What are you having? - Would you like some? - No, thank you. Did you enjoy yourself? Had fun? - Yes, madly. - I've been thinking, while waiting. I think it would be better if we broke up. - I agree. - You're made for living on your own, having adventures like this... and not for being with someone. - I agree. - "I agree" Always agree. - Because I agree! May I remind you that it was you who wanted us to live together. I didn't. - Yes, yes, I know. I cannot love a woman without wanting to live with her all the time. Would you have preferred that we saw each other once or twice a week? That we went away for a weekend without children? That we met in a hotel? - Yes, hotel is good. - Yes, it's good. In the beginning. But there's more than just the beginning. - Yes. There's also the end. - And in-between? - Thinking about the beginning while waiting for it to end. -You won't have to wait long now. - I like that you don't scream. It's something I cannot stand anymore, the screaming. - Can I just ask you one thing, just for tomorrow? If you can... pretend in from of Thomas. Like nothing happened. And after that... you'll say that you are leaving for work or something like that. And I'll explain it to him later, during the trip. - Alright. - May I turn off the light? Goodbye. - Have a nice trip.
