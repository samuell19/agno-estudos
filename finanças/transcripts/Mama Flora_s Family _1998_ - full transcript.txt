Hey, sweet cakes, do you know who this is? This is your great grandma flora. And I'm your friend, too. Let me tell you somethin'. You got a problem, you need anything you just come to me. I'll always look after you, you hear that? You got a birthday coming, sugar, don't you? Now, what can we get you special? Something really special. Hmm? Happy birthday, child. It's all we have to give you but this is your egg. I'm going to take this pencil and I make a Mark on it and put it under a hen about to set. When it hatches, that will be your baby chicken. ( Clucking ) Flora: That egg meant the world to me. I didn't have nothin' else. Just a little ole shack in Mississippi where I lived with my sister Josie my ma, my pa and my grandparents. And then one mornin' 'bout three weeks later I woke up to a surprise. A little baby chick. And it was all my own and more precious to me than anything in the world and when that little baby chick growed up, it made a mighty tasty... Stew. Oh, lord have mercy. Oh, y'all ain't got nothin' else to do but hang around in front of the depot? Yeah, you're looking good. Never mind how I look. Hi, there, flora. Good to see you. Hey, sugar. Lord have mercy. Well... here we are. Home sweet home. I'll just set this box inside. Much obliged. You fixin' to eat with US, Pearl? That don't sound like an offer to me. Here. Give a holler if you need anything. Now, flora, looks like maybe you're gonna need a man around the house what with all this company. Only man I need, albie, is the one that's going to turn around and walk straight back out that gate. But don't you need some wood chopped? Well, I guess I'll be going. Bye, grandpa. Bye-bye. No use in dawdling out here. Come on in. That there's your pa's old room. This place needs air. This is home, sweet cakes, home. This ain't no charity house, girl. Get up off your butt and start helping. What you want me to do? We need wood for the stove. Grandpa said he would chop the wood. Ax is on the post, baby. ( Sighing ) Man... I got to chop wood? Get your back into it. Go on, now. Couple years and you're gonna be choppin', too, sweet cakes. Oh, girl. Folks go to college to get educated sense and leave common sense down below. Here, take him. Like slicin' butter. Sweet cake, your mom done got herself in a whole heap of trouble. It'll be different 'cause you're here now. ( Yells ) ( Yells ) Ow! It'll take a little time though. ( Laughing ) Won't do no good there. ( Sighs ) Ow! ( Groaning ) I just about chopped my hand off out there. Oh, you'll be more careful next time. What about this? You'll get used to this old place, girl. Here, let me see. I'm cookin' up some pork chops for dinner. How's that sound? I ain't hungry. It's a long road that never turns, baby. Really? You ought to try sharecroppin'. We done worked the land from sunup to sundown but not one square foot was ours. It all belonged to maz Fleming. Flora! Flora! Am I going to see you tonight? ( Women laughing ) Times were so bad we could hardly put food on the table. Always had US some big barn dance at the end of the season. I mean everybody got all dressed up in their finest and danced till dawn. All right now, I got to go. Okay. How was the bagging, flo? You sure are looking lovely. May I have the honor of this dance? ( Chuckling ) I ain't much good at dancing. Well, all that you got to do is move to the music. ( Woman laughing ) All right. May I? Yes, sir. Maz Lincoln. Yes, sir. ( Slow waltz playing ) My name is Lincoln, Lincoln Fleming. You own the plantation? No. No. That would be my daddy. I've just come home to help for a while. You are? Flora. My name's flora. Flora. Do you know what that means? ( Laughs ) It means flowers. Miss flora you truly are the most beautiful flower here. Easy, now. Easy. Easy, now. How you doing, sir? George. Well, how's the family? Fine. Fine. You? Good. My father has sent me to talk to you about leasing you some more land. Ah, miss flora. Thank you. I was just asking about you. Wasn't 'specting company. Uh, maz Lincoln's been talkin' about given US a few more acres. And I'm also in a position to offer you an opportunity for employment, flora. My dear old grandma, my Nana, she's poorly. She needs someone to sit by her bedside and help tend to her needs. It would mean that you would have to move into our house and you would be paid a sum which I'm sure would make up for any inconvenience. Well, I wouldn't want flora to do anything that she didn't want to do yes. I'd love to. Yes, I would. Well, then... George? I don't know. I... Money for the family, pa. Well, I made up my mind. That's all there is to it. Then it's settled. Well, I never can keep my daughter from doing what she wants to do. You know, she's 99% henning and one percent mule. Here we are. Flora: That your house? That's it. Whoa. I'll take that for you, miss. Thank you. Thank you. You're going to hear all sorts of stories as to how my daddy and Nana made their money. Well, most of them are true. ( Laughing ) After your morning chores you'll be looking after miz Fleming. This'll be for you. When you're done, come down the backstairs outside to the kitchen. Woman: Morning, bessie. Miz Fleming, this be the new girl. She gonna sit with you. Come on over here and let me see what you look like. You prettier than the rest of them anyway. Sit down! You're in my light! I got to pee. It's easy for you young negras nowadays. But I got mine. And I bet that makes y'all mad. Warm up that thing. And take the top off of it. Now, you take them white folk-- them white folks hates US 'cause we got money. And them colored, they hates US too 'cause we got money. Let me tell you something. It was easy getting rich after the war 'cause the massas didn't have no slaves and the slaves didn't have no money. So you could get a negra to do most anything for next to nothing. They didn't care what they got paid 'cause they was free. ( Chuckles ) So, what your precious freedom done got ya now? Don't keep standing there looking at it! Empty it. ( Knocking ) ( Door opening ) I've come to see how you are. You looked so unhappy this afternoon. What's the matter? Do you miss your family? Flora, please... What is it? Has Nana been giving you a hard time? Well, don't you worry yourself with her. She's like that with everyone... Including me. We mustn't let my grandmother spoil what is special between US. Flora, I'm sorry. Would you like me to leave? Or should I stay? ( Laughing ) Henry, why don't you make these fine ladies comfortable while I arrange for some cold drinks. Get US some drinks. Yes, sir. ( Door opening ) I'm sorry. I am so sorry for what happened today. You must understand that I have to maintain a certain appearance around others. It has nothing... Nothing to do with how I feel about you. Forgive me? But you know, these young ones... Shh. Shh. Lincoln: Well, I don't know. This could be that day. All right, daddy, you ready? Come on, let's go. Come on. ( Laughing ) Bessie: You ain't the first. And you ain't gonna be the last. ( All laughing ) One after another. It's the truth, though. ( Door opening ) ( Gasps ) Bessie: Come with US. Where we going? Don't tarry, girl. Man: Maz Lincoln's had enough of you. You knowed, didn't you? You knowed he just wanted me for his whore. You never listen. You knowed! You been stubborn since the day you was born. Here. Here's your money. Take it. Take it. That's what he done paid... For his whore. Flora! ( Groaning ) You're all right. It gonna be all right. Won't be long now, child. The good lord be watching over you. ( Groaning ) ( Horse whinnying ) George? Good evening. Evening, maz Lincoln. And a fine evening it is. Word has it I'm about to become a pappy. Lord willing. ( Laughing ) Well, a blessing and a burden. That's what my Nana always says. Now, I know you all to be good people and I'm sure you want to provide a decent life for that grandchild of yours. Yes, sir. Well, in order to provide a decent life for that child this farm-- it has to prosper. Well, we been getting by. Indeed, indeed. George, you're one of our best tenants. Thank you, sir. Of course, you don't own this farm. Uh... no... Sir. And I don't expect there'll be too much of a future for that grandchild of yours without it. Besides, so much high-yellow blood in some pickaninny the child could grow up an embarrassment if it grows up in the wrong hands. Breathe, breathe. All right, now, push. Come on, come on. Push. It's coming out now. Here it is. Come on, push, push, push! Push! That's it! That's it! That's it! That's it! That's it! ( Baby crying ) This be the happiest day of my life. Give me the child. Mama, where you taking my baby? Where you going? Ma... mama! Where are you taking my baby?! ( Screaming ) Flora: I never did see my baby again. The Flemings made sure of that. They made sure I left town, too. Said if I ever came back to see my baby... Harm would come to him. That's the last time I ever blamed anybody for something I did. ( Swing music playing ) I told you she'd get the hang of things ( laughs ) Now don't you go thinking that lets you off the hook. ( Door opens ) Soon as I'm done with these pies, we're going into town. Made peaches for reverend Jackson, boysenberry for pat and Burt, cafe gets rhubarb and peaches for US. You like peach pie? It's okay. I know you like peach pies. Child, you don't know how blessed you are. God has given you an angel. Incoming. Here it comes. ( Train whistle blowing ) ( Passengers chatting loudly ) Woman: * when you stand... Shh! Men, I'm trying to get my baby to sleep. ( Fussing ) * ...Sleepin' * in his resting place... ( Baby bawling ) Oh... * swear I'll see * the angel... ( Train whistle blowing ) What's the matter, child? What's the matter? My baby. Your baby? My baby-- i'd lost my baby. Where? I don't know where... he is. They ain't got no right-- no right! The child's mine! Lyin'... lyin' like he in love. He never cared nothin' 'bout me. No matter how much money they paid my mama should have never gave up that boy. Time has a way of healing. Dry your eyes now. That's it. Now, where are you headed? Memphis. You know, bad things can happen to you in a big city. It don't matter. ( Bell clanging ) Well... That'd be it. Stockton, Tennessee. You sure about this? Don't wanna feel I pushed you. ( Sighs ) Thank you for your kindness. Well, I see folk like you all over the south heading off to Memphis, Chicago, Detroit and coming back in tears. Can't say I ever see them goin' in tears, though. But I got a feelin' you'd be just fine. Good luck. ( Train engine starting ) ( Train chugging ) Welcome, sister. Now, you've come to the right place. Flora: So the reverend Jackson took me into his church. Got me a job doing laundry and a place to live. Five years just seemed like a blink of the eye. * I am fightin' for my lord * in the army of the lord * * I am fightin' for my lord * in the army * * I am fightin' for my lord * in the army of the lord * * I am fightin' for my lord * in the army * * I believe our god * in the army of the lord * * I believe our god * in the army * * I believe our god * in the army of the lord * * I believe our god * in the army... * step right up. Let me show you the secret to nature's good, long life. This is an Indian formula. It cleanses the liver it flushes the kidneys. That's just the internal medicine. And I done sprung from a briar patch. Let me tell you about the external medicine. Ain't he gorgeous? You see this medicine here? It's called "big chief cures." And it's made from nature's own roots. Now, you can't buy it in no drugstore. You can't buy it nowhere but from me. Now, anybody out there got pain? On your hand and neck? How about your back? Don't be shy now. Don't be bashful.

I'm rubbin' it right in here. Now, you tell our good friends: Is this medicine helping you or not? Yes, sir! "Yes, sir!" ( Crowd clamoring ) Woman: The pain is gone. Ten cents, ladies and gentlemen. There we go. There's one for you. Look like there are a whole lot of sore shoulders needin' some attention. ( Laughing ) My name is booker. Booker t. Palmer. Oh, I'm Pearl. Pearl. And this is flora. Flora. Can't say we seen you around here before. Well, I crop cotton out of town here, about five miles that way. Booker. Yes, ma'am. I never heard a name like that. My pappy named me after booker t Washington who started a college for colored folk down in Alabama. You been to a college? Not unless you count the schoolin' that my granmama gave to me, flo. Hey hey, y'all been to a moving picture show? No. I never seen a moving picture show. Well, they got one playing here. Right here tonight at the town square. What say you? How about it, flo?

So how long you been living with Pearl and her folks? Ever since I got here. Well, it ain't easy, living out on your own. Well, I know how it is. My ma done died bringing me into this world, and my pa-- my pa, he went last year. The farm keeps me busy and all with work, but, well, none of it will ever take the place of family. You got a job here in town, miss flora? I do some laundry and cleaning. Reverend Jackson over at the church, he helped me get the work. Can't say I miss pulling cotton. No, sir. No, sir. Good lord's been giving you his blessing? And it's that blessing that I hope makes a place for me in your heart, flora. Well, if it's the lord's blessing you're looking for, you'd best be getting down to his house. Church? Church. Pearl Jefferson... I'm gonna tan your hide, leaving me like that. You the one that wanted to see the show. Why, flora, you was having such a good time I'm surprised you even seen me gone. I was having no such thing, sitting there with some man I don't hardly know. Sounds to me like you done taken a shine to him. I ain't taking no shine to another man for as long as I live.

That don't matter, flora. Don't matter much to me. There's a child. A boy. A boy? A boy. Where's the boy? I don't know. Is he cute as his mama? ( Chuckling ) Oh, you'll find the boy, flora. You are something else. Stubborn as a mule. You got a smile-- a smile that light up the whole world. And I know it's in there. I know that it's in there. It's waiting to come out. Just peeking...

( Cheering and laughing ) The new world champion, Joe Louis! The new world champion... Joe Louis is the best fighter in the whole world! The brown bomber! Whoo! Hey. What'd you say, boy? Did I hear you say... ( Chuckling ) That Joe Louis could beat any white man in the world? No, sir, I didn't say that. I heard you say Joe Louis could beat any white man in the world. No, sir, I just didn't say that. I know I didn't say that. You calling me a liar? No, sir, we don't want no problems here. Let's teach this nigger some manners. Come on, Kevin! Come on, hit him!

When your daddy left stockton I didn't know that I'd ever see him again. Flora: Willie! Willie! But the war and all in Europe threatening to come right over here I guess Kevin Hopkins and his buddies didn't seem interested in holding grudges anymore. Hey, girl. Flora: Boy, they done give you some good hair. Hey, girl. You sure looking mighty fine there, girl. Reverend Jackson: Heavenly father we gather together today to render special honor... Hope I ain't got to say nothing. And we beseech thy continued blessings upon our dear sister flora Palmer. ( Applause ) She has served her god faithfully she's served her community faithfully and she's served her family faithfully. Sister Palmer, throughout this town is known for her good works and it is our privilege today to pay tribute to her Christian charities. ( Choir ends song ) We also have here today a young brother of this church. Young brother Willie Palmer here all the way from Chicago and we ask him for his testimony. ( Congregation encouraging ) Well, y'all know I ain't never knowed my pappy. Y'all know that. But my mama here, she... I was fixin' to say she always telling me the right thing to do. Congregation: Amen. And I ain't always done them. As far back as I can remember I've been... coming here to this church-- mama been bringing me here. Amen. All: Amen. She tried hard to keep me in school. I know I just about killed her when I quit school, I know that but I wanted to be a man. I wanted to help out, 'cause, see, mama needed help. That's my mama. All: Amen. So I... I left her. I left home and I left my mama by herself but she's been with me. Whatever I done, she's been there. I love you, mama. God knows I love you. * gonna lay down my burdens * down by the river side * down by the river side * down by the river side... Ernestine: You made your mama proud, Willie. There wasn't a dry eye in that church. Everybody's just been talking about you coming back from Chicago, doing so good. It's lies. What you mean, lies? It's all lies. I ain't got no money. Ain't nothing I got on paid for. Dollar come in one hand and go right out the next. What I've been doing up there is been gambling and... I've been drinking and... Been running around. Been other women, ernestine. I ain't kept my faith with you like I was suppose to. The only thing I know right now is that I love you, ernestine. That's all I know. Now, I'm going to pay off all my debts. I'm going to do all of it. If you don't want to forgive me, I understand. No, it don't work like that. Not with this girl. Now, I'm not forgetting what you done but I ain't going to let it come between US neither. No, you straighten up, Willie Palmer and we can make US that life together. Not now. ( Laughing ) Willie: Where is my mama? That sound like my Willie. Today is your day. I figured on finding you two like this. Don't look like you spared yourself none. Give it to me, let me clean it up for you. Hey, Willie, you want a soda pop? Sure. Reverend Jackson said they building a big factory over in millington. Everybody says we're going to war. Seems they got plenty of jobs there making some airplanes. They ain't going to let no colored folks work there. Oh, Eleanor Roosevelt said they going to have to. Well, I ain't going to be the first negro going up there looking for a job and get kicked out the door, I know that much. Then maybe you going back to Chicago. I don't know, mama. It ain't nobody's business what I do. Long as you's my child you is my business. I ain't your child no more, mama. I'm a grown man. Will you just let me... Just let me be. Where you going? Where I belong. Back to Chicago? With them gamblers and harlots and dope and drinking yourself to death?! This ain't my home no more, mama. Oh, booker, booker, booker. Done lost one son, about to lose another. Help me. ( Gunshots and battle cries on TV ) Just ought to forget about catching them injuns. Di...? Diana? Diana? Next rack, we playing for shooters. ( Soul music playing ) I come to get you. Girl, you hear me talking to you? I said I come to get you. Mama, you ain't got no right coming up in here after me like this. You listen to me, and you listen to me good. I said, I come here to get you. You said I was free to go, right? Well, then leave me alone. I ain't gonna leave you alone, no nothin'. Not as long as there's a breath in my body. You're stinking drunk again. You comin' with me. Oh, man! All right, come on. Come on, grandma. Take me back to the penal colony. Take me back, sister, to where I belong... amen. Send me bowing and scraping for the massah, just like my daddy. Hallelujah. And where's my main man? Now, where did he go? How come Jermaine ain't here with me? Where did he go with his... idealism? His know-it-all on ice... His flash and dash, his power to the people. Hallelujah. Huh? People is just me and my son. You finished? End of service. I think I'm going to be sick. ( Diana grunts ) Mama, you ever been on a ship on a stormy day? No. Well... me neither, but this must be what it feels like. Here, drink this. That'll straighten you right out. I ain't drinking no more. My partying days are over. Hallelujah. Uck! You know, I take one step forward and 10 steps back. I must be the two-stepping queen of bad excuses. I don't know. I look at my son-- I mean, how can I ever make it up to him? He ain't asked to be born into this world, and all I done was screw it up. Well, none of US is perfect, baby. Yeah, but I wanna do the right thing. I just don't know if I know how. God's given you a second chance, and that's hope staring you dead in the face, baby. I did what I was scared to do for so many years. I went looking for the son I never raised. I went looking even though I had been told harm would come to him. I went looking because I had to. I just had to go back. ( Sniffling ) Man: Morning. Morning. I was on my way into town. Thought maybe you needs a ride. Well, now, I surely appreciate your kindness. Don't reckon you from these parts. I used to live around here. Lord, ain't nobody lived around here... Flora? Flora henning? Charlie. Well, I'll be. What-what... what you, what you doing here? I'm headed for the Fleming place. You know, I have some business there. The Flemings? Ain't too many folks got business around there. Ain't nothing there no more. Look here, you wants a ride? Now, I don't want to be taking you out of your way. I ain't got nothing better to do. You, uh... you married? No. My husband, he done passed on. A pretty woman like you she ought to have herself a man. I'll just take the ride, thank you. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Charlie: Well, Nana Fleming... dead. Oh, miz Fleming, she still live there all alone since her man done left her. Young maz Lincoln, he still there? Maz Lincoln dead. He done got himself killed. Some trouble with another man's wife. Heard tell about some boy child. Yeah, little maz Luke. Yes, ma'am. Luke. He there now? Ah, nothing around here for him. He done gone to college in Atlanta. What you know about his mama? Little maz Luke ain't got no mama. They done found him in a cabbage patch. Turned up one day out the blue and his grandma called him Luke from out the Bible. Yep... sure did. I'll wait here for you. I come to see miz Fleming. She's sick. Bessie. I'm flora. Maz Luke's mama. Flora. Miz Fleming won't see you. But she's gots to see me. It's the past, child. Just let it be. Bessie, I gots to know. Bessie, you was here. You-you know. Tell me that he's all right. Girl, she'd kill me if I tell you. But I'm his ma... His mama. I'm his mama. Maybe he don't want to see his mama. Maybe he don't want to meet the mama what give him away. But you know the truth, bessie. Tell him what they done to me, bessie. Tell him that I never stopped thinking about him. Please, bessie. Tell him... I was here. When, uh... He come home he... he gets his mail. You can write to him here. I'll see that he gets it. God bless you, bessie. Thank you. Flora: Are you getting my... Let... Letter? Oh. I... Won't... Lord, I don't know what to do. I've been writing and writing and writing and writing. Can't get one single answer. Not one letter from Luke. Maybe... maybe it's your will. If it is your will, then thy will be done. But I'm asking you, heavenly father to look down on Willie. Look down on Willie, lord. Give him a helping hand. He needs you. He needs you. God sent ab to Willie. Palmer. Hey, Palmer. You should have been finished with that truck an hour ago. I got me one more load and then I'll be done. Every man here has it just as tough as you. If you drop the ball, somebody else got to pick up the slack. I'm working fast as I can, boss. Fast as I can. Don't make me have to let you go. It was ab who tried to save Willie. Where's my rent, boy? You know you'll be getting it, miss lady. That's what you said yesterday. Now... A pretty woman like yourself ought not to be worrying herself so, hey? Well, if you don't get that rent, you'll be out on the street. Gots to have faith, miss lady. ( Swing music playing ) Cigarettes? Okay. Come on, what you got? What you got? Shoot that. Oh!

Five? 10! Give me 10. Yo, that's what I'm talking about. ( Laughs ) Come on. Oh! ( Men laugh, yelling ) Hey hey, let me look at you. Reg... I see you throwing good money after bad. I'ma pay you your money, reg. I'ma pay you your money. That may be... But in the meantime I'm out of a grand and still counting. Man, my luck is changing. I'm feeling-- there's not that much luck in all the world that's gonna make you a winner, Willie. Now if I were you, I'd start paying or start praying. Lookie, i'ma-- ( Grunts ) ( Coughs ) Okay. So see you all next week, okay? And make sure you get a flier now. Thanks. There you are. ( Chatting ) We had a good meeting. Sorry you missed it. Ain't nothing going right for me. Ain't nothing I do-- who. It's-- it's okay. Martha. Martha, I want you to meet Willie, Willie Palmer. Here you go. Mr. Palmer. Ma'am. Willie's gonna come stay with US for a while. Ain't that right? Men do everything women do in our house. Martha's bark is worse than her bite. Go on, get out of here. You give me your pay packet every week. I'll take some for rent and paying your bills and put some in a savings account. You'll get $5 a week for your pocket, and the rest will go toward paying off your debt and sending money home to your mother. Okay, Willie? It's Sunday, mama. You know there's no mail on Sunday. I swear, mama, you been out to that box half a dozen times since yesterday's morning. We just got a letter from Willie with a check. You got yourself a secret admirer? Flora! Flora, the Japanese done bombed Pearl harbor! It's on the radio. Flora, we're going to war. President Roosevelt: December 7, 1941 a date which will live in infamy. With confidence in our armed forces with the unbounding determination of our people... We will gain the inevitable triumph so help US, god. Ab, you really think they're gonna let US fight? ( Laughs ) When they run out of white boys. Flora: Willie and ab did go to war. Strange enough, their first battle was with the white men in their own platoon... They don't want US seeing their Betty grable. ...who didn't cotton to the idea of colored soldiers staring at a blonde bombshell in a bathing suit. ( People cheering ) Come back, now, safe. I will. I just want my chance to be a hero. I don't need you to be no hero, son. Mama, I'm going to make you proud. It's all right. I ain't always listened to you. And I ain't always been the son I oughta be to you. But this... I'm gonna do this right. Come back, son. I'm gonna make you real proud of me. Just come on back. Safe. ( Train whistle blowing ) I gotta go. I gotta go. Ernestine. I'm waiting for you. I love you, star. ( Train whistle blows ) Ruthana. Keep studying them books, you hear? I'm gonna write you every single day, okay, mama? You do that, son. I love you, Kevin. Uh, you can call me. Yeah, you take care. Flora: I remember staring at Mrs. Hopkins. For the first time in our lives, we were just the same. Two mamas saying bye to their boys and wondering if they'd ever see them again. ( Train whistle blows ) Hey, flora. Miss Lilly. What do you want? Give blood. Um... Wait here. You have to leave. But I've come to give blood. My son, Willie-- he's a soldier in the army. We don't take colored blood. Get out of here, nigra. Quit makin' trouble. What if my son gets hurt? What kind of blood you gonna give him? What's up, man? ( Sloshing ) "The souls of black folks," read it? Nah. W.e.b. Du bois-- social scientist, political leader, the force behind the Harlem renaissance. He believed in an educated negro elite. ( Whispering ) Close it up on the right. Close it up! Come on! Tight-- stay tight. Hold hold. Hold! ( Guns firing ) ( Grunts ) Ab! Ab! Hold on! Cover me! ( Yells ) Oh, god.
