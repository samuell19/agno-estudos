Are you at home? Then I'll be there in 20 minutes. Have you proposed to Anna? Why are you so dressed up? What's wrong with you? Everything OK? I was at the bank. I have a fucking problem... I got a notice from the tax authority that I have to pay back taxes because apparently some deliveries were out of the country... my accountant sort of explained it to me: I DON'T understand it. Somehow it's all gone wrong. And I now have to pay back a lot of money really quickly. And if not, then... we both... It could be, if we don't respond properly, there is a some sort of law regarding companies and the danger of bankruptcy. It also concerns you. The stuff that's lying around and hasn't yet been used. I haven't paid for that yet, either! It would also be sold... liquidated. Christopher, the end of construction is in two months. YES! How much? 138.000. 138.000? Yes, if I don't have the money... I don't know where... What a shit show. Yeah, such a shit show, you know. I was on vacation, the accountant was also on vacation. That's how the whole thing fell through the cracks. And now it's suddenly here... SHIT! And that's why I was at the Bank... is there a loan, some financing, some security... where they... jump in, or something. What do you have for security? The apartment here. Only the apartment? Yes. You know... I still have to pay stuff... and there's the question, if someone else could jump in. Otherwise it just won't be enough. OK, listen. I can offer to pay for a part of the bond. A part. Not for all of it. I can't tell you yet how much, but for part of the money. Anne. What? She's called Anne, by the way. And I've not yet popped the question. My God, you're in a bad mood today. Is there a problem with the Project? I've really messed up. Very Bad? Very Bad. You remember Elisabeth? I'm in a class with her. Oh yeah, I know, I know... but be nice to her, ok? Make friends. Visit her. Can I do anything else for you? Just be nice to her, ok? So, buzz off kid. Papa needs quiet. The guitar stays here. Elisabeth? I need to quickly get something from a coworker. - It could be a few minutes. - Yeah, I'll wait. So, I'm back. It took a bit longer. Sorry. But now we can go home. Where is your Mother? Shopping. Downtown. And when is she coming back? I don't know. Does your father always work at home? No, just today. Why? Just asking. Are you dating Laura? Who says that? She does. She's saying it everywhere. Laura isn't my type. Do you wear makeup? No, only sometimes. Rarely. And right now? No. Should I? What? Wear makeup? If you want. I'm just in the bathroom... Hey... how's the homework going? We're making progress. You could also go swimming. I can drive you. But I don't want to go swimming. We're grilling on Sunday. At our place, in the gazebo. Who's coming? Elisabeth, my wife and I. Do you want to come? Great. Yeah, I'd love to come. Should we pick you up? I know the way. Right. You were already there with Elisabeth. Yeah. Sunday then. At 5. How's it going with the kid? Johannes? He's doing well. He does his thing. You can certainly bring him again. Elisabeth would be delighted. Sure. I have another meeting on Wednesday with the structural engineers out in Grabow. Oh, they shouldn't make a fuzz about it. That was all already agreed. Everything is in the plans. That was what they wanted, so that's what we're doing. Are you taking them with you? Sure. Alright: to getting to know each other. Cheers. Look deep in the eyes. Refreshing. Cheers. Cut it out! Can you do me a favor? Sure. Can you xxxxxxxxxxx alone for a while? (Come into the house when Father come.) Why? Cause is xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx (I need to tell him a few words...) About what? About us... What, if I become a lesbian? You won't. How do you know? I know... Sure? Absolutely sure. (Can I help you, Mom?) (No, no need...) Wow, there are a lot. You can feed them afterward, if you'd like. Yeah, I'd like that. Where is Elisabeth? Do you want something to drink? No. I thought we were going to grill? Where is Elisabeth? She's coming later. How was it in the Maldives? Beautiful. Really Beautiful. But I hurt myself a little. Doesn't it hurt? No, no, it's healing and doesn't hurt anymore. It looks really bad. That must still hurt... Where is the bathroom? Around the back of the house. Thank you. Mum, could you do my hair? Not now. I'll be out in a minute. OK. When is Elisabeth coming? She just called. She's not going to be able to make it. She is still with her mother. Then we're not going to grill. We could still grill, if you'd like. Alone? We could also grill again this weekend. Then Elisabeth will be here. We'll see. It hurts. It'll be done in a minute. You're so beautiful. Such a beautiful girl. I know. Christine... are you still in town? Can you come out to the garden and take my place with Elisabeth? No, I have to go back to the construction site. Good. Thank you. Hi. How are you? In an hour at my place? At home. Good. Later. How long have you been married? 12 years. What's her name? Forget it! Come on... Do you have a girlfriend? No, no girlfriend. Can you bring someone with you next time? Someone young? How young? Young. Yes... Good. I've got to get going. I like you. You're really nice. Do you want to come with me? No, I'll stick around here. I've got to water the garden. And Christopher is also coming by to have a beer. And what about you? Wanna stay with that? Could you please answer me, messy? (darling?) What's your problem, young lady? I stay "by that". "With that"... I stay "with that". Christine, speak German with her! Go with your mother. It'll be late this evening. OK. I go with you, Mum. Will it be much later? I don't know. Maybe I'll sleep here. Whatever. Let's go... Bye, Dad... Bye, sweety... See you tomorrow. Of course... Are we not grilling today either? Where did you get that idea? Elisabeth isn't here. Or is she coming this time? Should I call her? No... You don't have to. What would you like to do? I want to feed the fish. When do you have to be back home today? I have time. Do you want to stay here a while? I guess you can take me home. Happy to do it. You can call me Markus, you know. Don't... I said don't! I said don't! How are your injuries, by the way? They're ok. Show me. Go ahead! I brought something for you. This is for you. Thank you. Would you do me a favor? What is it? Take your T-shirt off? What do I get for it? Please... Welcome home, Daddy. Happy aniversary. Thank you, sweetheart. Happy Anniversary. You too. I'm going to go change. Vacation is almost over. Are you glad to be going back to school? No. Not at all. Are there a lot of girls in your class? Half and half. And do you have a girlfriend? No. Kissed someone? Why do you want to know that? Who actually knows that you're here? Does your father know? No. Do you know this? Will you make me one as well? That looks terrible. Thanks. What're you doing? What's Johannes up to? I don't know. Do you like him? Some. Are you going to get a divorce? How did you get that idea? Just asking. Say then. How do you get this idea? Just asking! Tell me! She's weird sometimes. Who? Mamma. What do you mean weird? That... She makes me afraid sometimes. Who? Mamma. You don't need to be afraid of your Mother. She loves you more than anything. She'll never do anything to you. When is your birthday? Next Month. How old are you going to be? 12. You know that. You're going to be a really pretty, beautiful woman. I know. "WHORE" Do you want to spend the night here? Not tonight. Good. Then I'll make something for us to eat. Mum... Just playing the game, honey... I like you, Johannes. I like you too. If you need something, whatever it is, you can always come to me. Thanks. Even if it's money. I don't need any money. I ran into Elisabeth yesterday. I told her we often meet. It was a joke. You can relax. What are you doing? One more step and I'll jump. - Hey! - Christopher! Markus is already finished? Markus isn't here. Why not? We're meeting at the gym. Fine. I'll give him 5 minutes and then I'll go alone. Sit down. Thanks. And Johannes should stay there? That was the plan. Yeah, no problem. Sweet... Have you already found a school for Johannes? It's not an issue anymore. The young man is going to repeat a grade. You know, that's possibly better. He needs just a bit more time and... another year... Elisabeth was lucky. She's going to go on an exchange program. To England. The years of bi-lingual study paid off. But that costs a lot of money. Yes well, you get nothing for free. Is there a scholarship? How are you managing it? No, no, no... When she was a baby we invested in some stocks. Didn't Markus tell you that? No... Pretty much, pretty much. I should have also done that with my money. Why? Are you all having a hard time? Everything's fine. Then Markus can pay a little more attention to you. I certainly hope that he will. Otherwise I'll help him with it. Good idea... Kids! I tell you to be good! Where is your Papa? What's it to you? A whole lot. Don't try to pull that with me. How much time do we have? An hour, like always. How old are you? 22. Can you take off your shirt? Sorry. You can both get dressed. I don't know at all what went wrong there. We went in the hotel and it was weird, right from the beginning. He didn't pay any attention to me anymore. Can you imagine? We didn't have sex for a whole week? And then he was always gone in the evenings and came back really late. I didn't have any idea where he was. Maybe with another woman. I didn't care if he was. But without talking about it at all. And before we left, everything was normal. I tell you, sex with him is fantastic. He is a real man, you know? Sometimes he took me really rough, wild... And sometimes... he was suddenly really tender, almost shy. And boy did he go down on me. He sometimes didn't stop until I came. And when are you going to ask how I am? You come in here and tell me a bunch of shit! I had no vacation and I also didn't get fucked. Welcome to my world. It's been years, years since he looked at me. It's been years since he went down on me. What do you think? Do you think you know the world? And you complain about one week? You slut. You could have a thousand men. Look for someone else. But don't come to me crying your eyes out. I can do that all by myself. I don't need you here for that. I'm doing shitty! Welcome to my world. Fuck off! You are an hour late. I've tried to call you ten times. Are you jerking me around? If so, then don't come here anymore. Go! They're waiting for me at home. I don't have that much time. I'm sorry. Forget it. Please! Please... You rat! What did you tell your father, where you are? I'm staying overnight at Daniel's, a friend. And what did you tell your wife? That I'm travelling for one night on business. And she believed that? I'll know tomorrow morning. I would have bet you weren't coming. Well, here I am. Your injuries are healed. What do you want to do tonight? I'm really beat from today. I just want to sleep. It's still light outside. Do you want to play something? What do you have? Monopoly. Not really. Then make yourself comfortable. Yeah... Are we sleeping outside or inside? Where do you want to sleep? Where do you want to sleep? I want to sleep here, inside. Then we sleep inside. Hello Mrs. Larsen. Hello Johannes. Elisabeth isn't here. She's still out. I didn't want to talk to Elisabeth, I wanted to talk with your husband. Oh. But he's still at the construction site. What do you want with him? Just tell him that I was here. I can do that. When is he coming back home? Only later, in the evening. Thanks. - OK. Ciao. - Bye. You and Elisabeth-are you together? Why? I'm only asking, because you're so often there. What do you want with her father? He's over at our place a lot. Why was he at your place? Because of my father. They are working together on a project right now. They have a lot of dough. How did you get that idea? Elisabeth's clothes. I don't like her. Can I tell you something? Yeah... And you won't tell anyone else? I promise. I have a plan. About what? I'm going to blackmail the Larsens, especially the father. You're crazy! Chistopher's boy was looking for you today. Where? At home. He wanted to talk to you. Did he say why? No... I was only to tell you that he was here. Must be because of the site. He wanted to see the new site. He's constantly bugging me. He's a nice-looking boy, that Johannes... I'm going home now. Yeah. Do that. You can't come to me at the house, that can't happen. Why not? Because they don't understand that we're friends. But we're more than friends. We're buddies, pals-not more. Aren't you interested anymore? Johannes, it's not that simple. Only because I'm younger? Because you're young! I'm twelve! I know. I think I love you. I like your smell. Please! Please! It'll stay our secret. I'll take my shorts off for you. I'm taking you home. Don't bother, you jerk-off! Should we go away? Just the two of us? Elisabeth can stay with your mother. That would be nice. I'll get it. - Can I speak with your father? - Yes. Papa? Hello Markus. Johannes... what do you want? You said if I need anything, no matter what, I can always come to you. Come on, take your backpack. We'll talk about it outside. No, I want to talk about it here. Come on we're going outside. What do you want? 150.000 Euros. That's absurd. I can tell your family how you kissed me. Elisabeth, go to your room. Or should I say how you get naked in front of me? Christine, that's not true! Or how you grabbed me. Or... how I bled. Hello Papa, yes, I'm still at the gym. I'm staying another hour. Then I'm coming home. Ciao... You have an hour. The clock's ticking. Markus... How long has this been going on? Since summer vacation. Where did you meet? In your gazebo. How often? Often enough. You are ruining our lives. You shitty little rat. You liar. Can you prove it? The condoms in the coffee can. And? Markus's body is completely covered with hair. Elisabeth, go! Go to your room! Now! And what happens now? You get 150.000 and then what? You vanish from our lives? Probably not. The hour's almost up. Markus is on time. He has ten minutes left... He's coming right now...
