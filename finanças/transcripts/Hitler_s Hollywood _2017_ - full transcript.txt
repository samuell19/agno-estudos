- Doctor? - Yes. Anything missing? No, I have everything. Good, then have a think. I'm thoroughly happy. It couldn't be better. Then all's well. Yes, indeed, gentlemen We're happy indeed Because from now on The world belongs to us Yes, indeed, gentlemen Worries are far away We do what we enjoy Whoever disturbs us Before he twigs it We'll have soft-soaped Yes, indeed, gentlemen You can bet on it Indeed, indeed, indeed! Attention! Go down to 30 meters. Silently. No movement in the submarine. Our lives no longer belong to us. They're no longer ours, Boehm! Are they? We have to go on for as long as there is still breath in us. On the submarine, again and again, until the dear Lord sets us free. Sleep well, fellows. Know... Farewell. I can't see you. Aels! "I do not want to die in vain. I would love to perish on a hill of sacrifice for the Fatherland. To bleed the blood of my heart for the Fatherland. And heralds of victory descend. We have won the battle. Live on high, 0 Fatherland. And do not count the dead! For you, sweet one! Not one too many has fallen.“ Still the world does not collapse It still carries on Still the world does not collapse It will be gay again It will be sky blue again "Propaganda is an art form. Propaganda has just one objective, and that objective is to conquer the masses. Alluring people into an idea so in the end they are captivated by it, and can no longer free themselves from it." We're in a madhouse! Come on. “Propaganda is totalitarian, regressive and nihilistic. You remove any remaining substance from meaningful terms, and use their shell to advertise with an enticing appearance. From beneath the tumult of propaganda a skull appears.“ Sing! People, listen to the call... Can't you sing? I'll teach you. - People, hear... - People, hear the... The call for the last battle. People, listen to the call... You see, there are things going on that you don't understand. But us proletarians, we have to watch ourselves. That's it. And now, you youngsters have to help us. You have to stand by us old ones. Or we won't manage it. - You don't even have a girlfriend. - What's the point? Come on. Don't be like that! - Where should I go? - What a question! To your father, of course, where you belong. That is the very question. Where does the boy belong? I had very good parents. But at 15, I ran away. Thousands have run away. - Then they were rascals. - Youngsters are wonderful! Youngsters have always been a big mystery. They ran away to trappers, to gypsies. The great pull of adventure has always called. Where does a boy belong? Open it then! You've all gone mad! There, Heini! Here's a mirror. Superb. Our flag is fluttering at us. "A clear criticism of earlier, crass and exaggerated attempts to please the new rulers. The communists are portrayed not as opponents but as comrades led astray. At the end, the ghostly columns of SA soldiers marching seem to emerge from the dead Heini as if he were resurrected in their ranks." ...which represents all Germany. And we'd now like you German boys and German girls... to take in what we hope Germany to be one day. We want to be one nation and you, my young people, will now become this nation. Spades down! Germany. - I almost forgot. - What? - Shall we go? - A new film? In Rome, the 14th International Sports Week. In the polo tournament, Prince Louis Alexander and his team had a strong win. The Prince received the Gold Cup from his fiancée, Princess Irina. If the gentleman would like to come closer. Not a word of truth in it. It's all nonsense. People don't like to be alone at night Because love in the moonlight On the one hand and the other And more Because people need A little bit of love You have to be able to play the piano Whoever plays the piano Has luck with women DO NOT WALK ON THE SAND HERE A giaour! A giaour! Don't do anything to hurt my father. I'm not saying it for him. It was great between us two But sadly, sadly Business interests come first. We four. If only you know how good you look In an apron. Would you give me a couple of bread rolls for me to remember you by? Would you like some sausages too? If I may. My pleasure! As I stand here Is how I am, yes sir! There was you, only you. I'm alone in the night My soul wakes and listens The wind has told me a song Of fortune indescribably beautiful It's lovely. I'll never leave. - Never? - Not ever. - The steamer leaves tomorrow. - I shan't be on it. Are you mad? You and the rest of our cold high society, what do you know about nature? You're behaving like a wild one! Like a wild one indeed! Come! Come! The wind has told me a song Of a heart That I am missing The wind You see, ten years ago, I turned back, just as the steamer was leaving. Back then, I thought the island was paradise. Then, later, I thought it was hell. - And now? - Now... I don't regret it. Regrets are always foolish. - What sort of a person are you? - I have a good heart. It just needs to be uncovered. Panic hovers over us, gentlemen. Do you know what that means? Panic amongst two million people? The paper has been banned. The police have closed the printers. - Madeleine Lawrence? - No. No. No, Madame, she's not here. It is your mother's fatherland that renders you this service. Séraphine. Fernand. - Did you fly here? - It was no distance. - Where is your airplane? - I parked it on the market square. "The effectiveness of propaganda demonstrates one of the chief characteristics of modern masses. They don't believe in anything visible, not in the reality of their own experiences. They do not trust their eyes and ears, but only their imaginations. What convinces masses are not facts, not even invented facts, but only the consistency of the illusion." And if I found a fortune I'd just gobble it up I wouldn't need to go to work I wish I wasn't so But it's no good wishing I am as I am To stick with our popular comparisons, the penny is slow to drop. Today I see the world in a rosy light Everyone wears a smile on their face Everything looks like under a charm I have you, and you have me What more do we want? I am young and you are young And the world is our oyster Everything is easier to achieve If we stick together From today my life has been restored Along with the apartment You have refreshed my heart I have you and you have me What more do we need? You can admit it. No need to be embarrassed. A charming little woman who is afraid and is ashamed to be afraid who admits that she's ashamed she's afraid is the most perfect woman a man could wish for. I'm sorry to disappoint you. I'm generally very daring, brave and strong. Why do you want to be like that? You see, that suits you far better. No, leave it here. Perhaps this heroic woman will scream again and then... - Then I'll show you how brave I am. - Awful. - Show me. - What? What you look like when you're brave. Oh, God, that's awful. It's all wrong. No. - Don't I look brave? - Yes, but it doesn't suit you. Far too many wrinkles. All your charm has gone. No, a woman's face must be soft. Tender and feminine. - I like you much better weak. - But I don't like myself like that. Because you can't see how attractive you are then. - Can we change the subject? - Of course. To the weather or so? - You're in danger. - Always. Don't you love danger too? When people go to bed In a pointed nightcap And entreat their king to protect them We slip festively dressed Behind the taverns Dawdling along under the street lamps The night isn't only for sleeping The night is when it all happens When morning finally dawns Behind dark panes And the men without a bride Stay side by side They hatch bombs out of conversations Held in whispers Rebellion, rebellion in the catacombs - Good heavens! - Look at Debureau. Are you crazy? Watch out! Don't use your sword, but your verses. They're more effective. The night isn't only for sleeping The night is when it all happens World War II begins Our purpose is to work for the nation. That is the ruling principle of my work. Everything else is secondary. Whoever was born to be leader, needs no other teacher than his own genius. My sons, what is the answer? Are great minds born or formed? Formed, Your Highness. Born, Your Highness, not formed. Let's discuss that. Genius is not born of its mother but of the entire nation. Excellent. But the state, through its schooling, first points the way to perfection. No. Genius, abandoning imperfect schools, can, with its own resources, find its way to perfection. I'm so calm now. So happy. I loved my wife very much. Good-bye, Franziska. At school they said we don't have a proper father. What do you think? It's rubbish. Franziska, I can't leave you again. You did for years looking for adventure. Now when it means something, you can't? THE GERMAN NEWSREEL NEWS FROM THE FRONT FROM THE PROPAGANDA UNIT June 1940, German Occupation of France. France was crushed in 39 days. Germany knows that this victory was won thanks to the leadership of brave soldiers and excellent organization. A view of the Eiffel Tower. Left of the Fuhrer is Professor Speer. A few days ago, Chamberlain declared to an American that England and her allies feel they are custodians of civilization fighting medieval barbarianism. So these are the custodians of culture. And these are the barbarians. Where rats appear, they bring destruction. They are shrewd, cowardly and cruel and usually appear in large swarms. In the animal world, they represent insidious and subterranean destruction. No different to the Jews amongst people. Jewish spirit and blood will no longer contaminate the German people. Under the leadership of Adolf Hitler, Germany has raised the banner against the eternal Jew. Europe cannot be at peace until the Jewish question is settled. If the international financial Jewry were to succeed in driving nations into another world war, it will result not in a Jewish victory, but in the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe. Are you all bridled up? - What do you mean? Is this a circus? - We'll see when the soiree begins. Well? From the front you look like Catherine the Great. And from behind as fit as Napoleon. Don't mention Napoleon. He was anti-Semitic. That's why he also went broke in Moscow. Here in Frankfurt we have our head office. In Gibraltar, there's England. And what is there? Jerusalem. Want to set up a branch there too? The reverse, my dear man. We are the branches of Jerusalem. People appear not to know how to deal with a great man. - But you do know? - Well, yes. I mean, I don't know. But I should be glad if I could say I am a loyal servant to my master. Stop that! Would the lady like to dance now? No, not anymore. It's outside. Start! Then remove it. No. Let me have it back. Jew! Jew! There he sits, the unholy Jew. In months of trial, all he has done is lie. Let me live! I want to live! I want to live! Excuse me, miss. I have a spare ticket. Perhaps I can be of service to you. Here come the Germans. - What's happened? - I have to leave. You don't need to worry about hurting me, but... Inge, you have to trust me. You are to be my wife. - Is that really still so? - Inge. That can't shock a seaman Fear not, Rosemarie We won't let our life sour Fear not, Rosemarie And when the whole world shakes And the world becomes unbalanced That can't shock a seaman Fear not, Rosemarie One night in May So much can happen You can lose your heart And it goes one, two, three One night in May You can dream so sweetly Sitting under trees All sorts of things can happen We would like to drink cool wine Where glasses should be clinked For we must, we must be parted Give me your hand Your white hand Farewell, my darling Farewell, farewell For we sail For we sail For we sail to take on England England That's pretty. Where's it from? It's from... the south sea. It might upset him. "Leaders have a concern that supersedes all utilitarian considerations. They want their predictions to be true.“ After months of silence, the Fuhrer takes the only remaining possible course of action, saying, "I have decided to place the fate and future of the German Reich back in our soldiers' hands. Germany is in a terrible crisis. We live in a period which will determine everything and change the face of Europe." The army attacks. Which Germany do you mean? The outdated one, resting on the splendor of the Holy Roman Empire? This utopia should collapse. A German Empire must come, and Prussia lead it. Only Prussia has the material and moral right to hold this position, not Hapsburg. Hapsburg has proved itself incapable of such leadership because it is prepared to share its power with foreign nations who cannot have the interest of the Germans at heart. "The similarity between Otto Gebuhr's screen Friedrich and the popular image of Hitler cannot be ignored. A genius. Of course his plans and deeds are based on intuition.“ You must be wondering why I have called on you unannounced. I don't wonder about anything with you. What's to become of us? Don't worry about that, ladies. You'll go to a concentration camp. - And now? - Now we should get some sleep. - And where? - Somewhere nice. A heart like mine Doesn't like to be alone All clear! War with the Soviets. That's why the captain had to leave straightaway. I know another miracle will happen And a thousand fairy tales will come true I know no love can pass so quickly When it is so immense and wonderful In the beautiful time of roses I found a darling Berlin has 4,220,000 inhabitants. I want to show you Berlin. - You're from Berlin tool - Why? - Charlottenburg Sports Club. - No, the trunks are from the old lady. - Old lady? - Yes. Oh, your old lady? You leave your mother alone on the first day of your holiday! - First day, I wish! - Why? It's my only day of holiday. I like you much better than earlier. And what about your mother? I have no mother. I have no one at all. - Not even relatives. - Nor do I. Oh. - I just had to get away from It all. - Really? - Don't you believe me? - Of course! - That's exactly what Mum said today. - Your mum? - No, our matron. That's what we call her. - Then she had a great idea. What are you doing this afternoon? - I have to ask Inge. - The loudspeaker? You weren't listening. Beautiful. That was a delightful picture, Madam. So natural. It will be a lovely series alongside the fashion show. An event of the day, something unique, like you. It's current. - But it's usually done by men. - Photography? Yes. - Photography. - And usually the event too. The body keeps working while we sleep. The heart beats, the lungs breathe. But we're not aware of it. At most we dream. The city sleeps that way too and dreams. Within It, Its blood circulates and life goes on. And are you... Are you happy, Rolf? Happy, Renate? Who is happy? In terms of the principle of the people's right to self-determination, I have to say we wild ones are the better democrats. On the bridge, too le doo The girls walk up and down Your friend says to come up. We're nearly there. Yes. Coming. What's the smell? - You can't just puff at me. - I'm sorry, but... I had to puff. Your hair. I won't do it again. Do you want the total war? Do you want it, if necessary, to be more total and more radical than anything that we can even yet imagine? ...a surprise, which will shoot up our shares beyond expectation. Gentlemen, that's all I wish to say for now. But please trust in me. As we all trust in our Titanic. Who is in charge, President Ismir or the captain? The captain naturally does what the president demands. And why does he demand such nonsense? DIE TERRA PRESENTS PORT OF FREEDOM La Paloma, ohé It will be over some day The sea will take us one day And not return any of us On the Reeperbahn, at half past midnight Whoever has never, in the snug night Come back to the sea. Sailing. Come back to the sea. Stay with me. Hannes! In an industrial plant in Berlin. "The sun sinks. Not much longer will you thirst, burned heart! A promise is in the air, blowing to me from unknown mouths. The great coolness comes." Beautiful. Yes. Beautiful. That was wonderful, Aels. Oh, there's no skill in hitting it at this distance. But from a galloping horse is something else. Bravo! Do you see the rainbow? The bridge which swings over us. Who knows how soon we will have to walk it? What should I think about then? About you? If I were to die now... that would be the sweetest death. "Gentlemen, in 100 years a wonderful color film will be shown about the terrible times we are going through. Don't you want to play a role in this film? Stand firm so that in a hundred years the viewers do not boo and hiss when you appear on screen.“ In the summertime many a one Has lost their heart No love is more sacred than the love of your fatherland. No joy is sweeter than the joy of freedom. But you know what is in store if we don't win this battle with honor. So whatever sacrifice is required make your priority the sacred values for which we are fighting and must win if we are to remain Prussians and Germans. With foreboding, but undaunted Dawn is breaking And the sun, cold and bloody Lights up our bloody path In the next few hours The world's fate will be decided Others are shaking now And the certain die is cast They're shooting at our town! Come on! I take Prussia and Kolberg to my heart. There only remain a few jewels in our crown. Kolberg is one of them. Hans Albers made 19 more films after 1945. He considered Grosse Freiheit Nr. 7 his best film. He died in 1960. Ilse Werner was temporarily banned from working due to her role in Wunschkonzert. Never able to repeat her former success, she made just ten films in the Federal Republic but worked as a dubbing artist and TV presenter. She died in poverty in 2005. Ferdinand Marian was issued a life-long work ban due to his role in Jew Suss. Shortly before he was likely to be pardoned, he died in a car crash. Suicide was suspected. Veit Harlan was exonerated post-1945. He went on to make 11 films in the German Republic. In his many trials, he claimed the Nazis had taken his non-political work and used it for their aims. He claimed he was forced to make Jew Suss. He never asked for forgiveness. He died in 1964. Kristina Soderbaum was allowed to work directly after the war and appeared in her husband's films. One other film role followed, in Hans-Jurgen Syberberg's Karl May. She died in 2001. Helmut Kautner was a major filmmaker post-1945. He went on to make 27 feature films and 24 TV films. He died in 1980. The screenwriter of Munchhausen was the popular author, Erich Kastner. As a banned author he had to use a pseudonym, Berthold Burger, absent from the opening credits. Kastner was given special permission to write the screenplay. The screenplay included some anti-totalitarian barbs, but Kastner couldn't go too far for fear of endangering himself.
