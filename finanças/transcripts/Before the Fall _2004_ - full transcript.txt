Friedrich! Quitting time! - Friedrich, your money. - Thank you. Hello, Mr. Merten! Friedrich! Be careful! Berlin, late summer, 1942 Watch out! I'm throwing a stone! Thomas, a hard left, a hard left! Go with him! Come on! - Move, Thomas, come on, again! - We need more ice. Sorry. I'm late. - So I see. Why? - I had to work. - Today is important. You know that. - Is that them? Yes, that's them, the Napola students, our new elite. Spiffy, huh? But they still put their pants on one leg at a time. Alright. That should do. Don't let 'em get to you. Got a problem, kid? You want I smack you one, boy? I'll make you even uglier. And you? You say something? I can't hear you. What's going on? You okay? Fight over. Next! Well done. - Keep away. - And keep your guard up. - Box! Go! - Go in! Go in! Go in! Get back! Get back! Guard up! Go in! Take the left, the left! That's it! Now hit him! Guard up! Keep your guard up! Keep your guard up! Good. Go get him, Friedrich, go! Now! Come on! Take him! Here it comes. - You fought great. - You put up a good fight out there. Well done. Heil Hitler! I saw your fight. I like your boxing. Where do you go to school? I don't. I just graduated. Have you heard of the Fuhrer's schools? The National Political Academies? I teach boxing and German at one. At the Napola in Allenstein. The entrance exams are taking place now. Sign up there tomorrow morning. Maybe I can do something for you. What's your name? Friedrich Weimer. I am Heinrich Vogler. You're talented, Friedrich. Man, oh man! That's the elite, Friedrich! - Really? - They only take the very best. How did you get in? My coach recommended me. Who's that? And jump! Next. And jump! Next. - Heil Hitler, Friedrich! - Heil Hitler. Nice of you to come. We'll examine you first, then fitness tests, alright? Good. Go line up. Thirteen. Ten. Eye color... Fifteen. Hair color? B. Why do you want to be a cadet at the Fuhrer's academy? Because I want to serve Fuhrer, Folk and Fatherland. Nordic. Class One B. SUITABLE Where were you? - Boxing. - At this hour? No, I... I was at the entrance exam for a Napola. You were what? You're not going there! But Papa! It's my big chance! It can really get me somewhere. Absolutely not! The Hitler Youth's bad enough, an elite school is out of the question! You start in the factory, like we agreed. Why? I could go on to university, become somebody. You don't even have to pay. Because I say so. We won't have anything to do with these people! Yes, Father. Why is Papa so mad? - I could go to a school. He doesn't want me to. - What school? A really special one. It's in a castle. It has everything. Real showers, a boxing hall, and even gliders. And when you graduate, you're part of the elite. - You don't have to worry about money. - And Papa doesn't want that? But it sounds great. - I'll come out even dirtier. - Then forget it. Here's your invitation to become an apprentice. You start next month. - Next month already? - Yes. So you don't get any stupid ideas. Are you excited? I want to stay here. Nonsense! It'll be nice there. The country evacuation is like a holiday camp. You don't have to go in the bunker, and all your friends are with you. Hey! Does a German boy act like that? No. "Dear Mama, don't be mad at me. I believe this is the chance of my life. Your Friedrich." "Dear Father, I forged your signature on the permit. If you pull me out, I'll tell them what you said about the Napola." Wake up! We're there. - Could you let me out here? - Of course. Thank you. You're welcome. - Mama, I have one already! - Daddy just slaughtered it for you. Just pack it away. Tidy yourself up. Just look at yourself! Tubby, good vacation? Stand there. Take your brother in your arm. - Smile. - Herr Von Brock. Nice summer? - Fine, thank you. - Madame. Friedrich! Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler. - Good to have you. - You convinced your father. - No, I just left. And the signature? I did it. That's not done here, Friedrich. A true cadet is honest and sincere. Oh well, you'll learn. I'll show you your uniform. - One complete set. Make sure they fit. - Yes, sir! It's not so common for someone to be taken at your age. I put in a word for you. I hope you appreciate it. Ah, Schneider, come here. This is Friedrich Weimer. He's new. He'll be in your room. - Show him around and introduce him to his new comrades. - Yes, sir. I'm Christoph. Welcome to Allenstein. Thanks. First I'll show you the room. Then you can get changed. Hey, pretty boy, now we have a real Arian, too. And here we are. That's your bed, and this is your locker. So, training and drill clothes, bottom left. Uniforms hung up. Sewing kit, clothes brush, small personal effects. Cap on the brown shirt. Below, towels and handkerchiefs. Bag on top. Toilet bag on the hook. Keep it sharp - or the duty cadet will pull it all out. - Yes. You can manage the rest. That'll be one desert. - What? - A joke. The first time is free. Hurry! Speech in 15 minutes. - Get changed. See you downstairs. - Yes. Friedrich! Friedrich! C'mere! Sit with us. Sit. Cadets! Teaching staff! My most heartfelt welcome to the new year of service, 1942. To all new students, I emphasize that this is a place where you will be educated without regard for your origins. Farmer or factory owner's son, in this school everyone's equal. You are the future elite of our Thousand Year Reich. Men make history, but we make the men. We will take care of you. We will polish the raw diamond in you until you become shining gemstones. For when the final victory is achieved, we will need many governors. Not just in Austria or Germany, I speak of governors for Washington, Moscow, London or Cape Town. So use your time well. Steel your body and soul and be faithful, dependable comrades. To our brave soldiers at the frontiers of our Reich and our beloved Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler, three times: Sieg! - Heil! - Sieg! - Heil! - Sieg! Heil! "Our flag waves us forwards, We go forward man for man, We march for Hitler through night and need, With the flag of the young for freedom and bread, Our flag waves us forward, It is the flag of a new era, And our flag leads us to eternity, Yes, our flag is greater than death!" Guys, listen up. This is Friedrich Weimer. He's our new roommate. - Hi, Friedrich. - Hello. This is Wilhelm. We call him Tubby. His father is the district meat supplier. - That's why he was accepted. - Don't listen to him. - What do you want for your magazines? - 300 grams of liverwurst. - 300 grams? You're crazy! - Right! Maybe I'll let you have another look at that photo, hmm? - This is Tjaden. He holds the room's farting record. - Hi. Hello. - Current time: 8 seconds. - Yeah. - What kind of photo? - My sweaty sisters doing sports. - What? - My biggest source of income. I even sold their socks for two marks. - Someone bought them? - You don't know my sisters. Back there is Siggi. Jaucher's coming! Friedrich, go! Attention! - New cadet? - Yes, sir. - Name? - Weimer, Friedrich. So you're the one. You've got quite the reputation. Supposed to be quite dashing. What's this mess? Tidy this up properly! Don't sleep on the job! Twenty push-ups! Now! And one! And two! And three! And four! And five! And six! And seven! And eight... - What's going on? - Locker inspection, sir! Stand up. - Enough, he's new here. - Yes, sir. Dismissed. I'd say you just made yourself an enemy. Christoph? What? - I just wanted to know... - Talking in bed is forbidden. - Heil Hitler, Heinrich. - Heil Hitler, Karl. Evening, gentlemen. Welcome to Allenstein. Thank you. Get up! Make your beds! Report to morning training! Hurry up, Friedrich. - Thanks. - Don't worry. I learned it at my old school. - I'm Friedrich. - Albrecht. Can't you hurry up? Seems to me that laziness is taking over, Weimer! Get going! Get down to the quadrangle. Get running, you softies! I'll run you ragged! Till you sweat blood! In two rows! Present! Hurry up! Down on the ground! Push-ups! Go, go! And one! - And two! And three! - Schulze, straighten your back! Four! - Krüger, lower! - And five! - Six! And seven! And eight! - Gladen pissed his bed again. Nine! Ten! Attention! Cadet Gladen! Three steps forward! Get your mattress. Pants down. - What? - Pants down for God's sake! And now piss! Come on! As you wish. Cadets, we're doing squat jumps! Ready! One, two, three... Four, five, six... You will jump until this cadet here pisses. Three, four, five, six... One, two, three, four, five, six... One, two, three, four, five, six... One, two, three, four... Stop! Stand to attention! Thank him! Take your mattress. Get out of my sight, you filthy swine! He who does not want to fight in this world of struggles, does not deserve to live. Eat well! Eat well! Cadets! I am pleased to welcome here the son of an old comrade from the early days of our movement. Albrecht Stein, the son of our new governor, Heinrich Stein. Welcome! Welcome! Welcome, Albrecht. You're lucky. You got the best room. - Who's that? - That's Katharina. But she's taken, so you know. - Says who? - Me, fat boy. And as Darwin describes the development of species, so, too, do races compete with one another. Today we will discuss the topic, "Roman writers and the Jewish question." What principles did the Fuhrer give the National Socialist movement to lead it to victory? The culling out of the weak guarantees the survival of the strong, as in the animal world. What saying of Martin Luther's does this remind us of? "... after the devil, you have no more bitter, poisonous or tough enemy than a righteous Jew who takes Judaism seriously." A modern night bomber can carry 1800 bombs. Over how many kilometers can it drop them while flying at 250 km/h, dropping one bomb a second? - What is it? - It's the pastor. He brings the death reports. Come with me. Are we alone? Yes. Shall we? Combination. More power. More power! More power! Don't sleep, man! Guard up! Keep your guard up! Pull your fists up! Guard up! Do it! Go! You have strength and talent, but you have to work on technique. Don't punch when you're off-balance. Hit from the front when it's safe, but without mercy, right? You must be prepared to. In that moment forget your humanity, your learned pity and false modesty. When you can do that, you can reach your potential. Only then will you be ready for the big fights. What big fights? Come with me. The golden days of our boxing squad. That's Franz Jensen, 1937 at the Napola championships. Allenstein was the best boxing school in the Reich. And then? Potsdam took the cup from us the last few years. - When are the championships? - In Winter. If you train hard, - you might get there. - Really? Yes, maybe. So, hit the showers. No pity. It's the only way he'll learn. - Get one on the nose? - You could start gluing... Mail! Wait. This is mine. - Müller! - Yes! Yes, yes! Friedrich, package! - The swimming photo. - Yes. - Look. You can have all of it! - We'll see, Tubby, we'll see. - Want to see? - Why does he get to see it for free? Because it's so much fun to see you suffer, Tubby! Hey! You can't do this! - Tomorrow afternoon at the earliest. - Come on, Christoph, please! "Dear Friedrich, I hope you are well. I don't know if you heard, but Dad got visited by the Gestapo and now has to work double shifts. He mustn't know I'm writing to you. Please be decent and brave always. Hans is well in the country. I miss you both very much. Love, your mother." Tjaden! Wow! What? Everyone takes a deep, comradely pull and it's gone. Yes? Cleaned up? - You doing the school paper? - From the next edition. You like writing, huh? I do, really. What's that? My essays from my old school. I just got them back. And? Flip through them. Give it to me. I put hairs in the pages. They fall out when it's opened. Look! None in here. They're all still here. My mother tells me that they love what I write, but they don't even look at it. Be happy. It's like winning a fight without fighting. No. It's like getting a medal 'cause they can't be bothered to watch you fight. Give them to me. - What are you going to do? - Read. - You want to read them? - Sure. Or are you afraid of my opinion? - No. - Alright then. Friedrich! You want to see something? Come on! - When did you find it? - Today. - You're going to look in? - If you help me, I'll help you. - Why you first? - I found it. And I have to check. - You're the rearguard. - I'd rather be the vanguard. - Friedrich, please! - Alright, since you found it. See anything? No, no one there. Let me see. No one there. - What are you doing? - It's my turn. - There's no one. - Still. And? Nothing. Just like you said. Shit! - Friedrich? - Yes? How did you know she was there? You suddenly stopped breathing. Ready? Ready! Pull! Run! Go! Friedrich! Jump over the gate, you assholes! "Silence! Enough whining. You should come hence with me, fine virgin. "May God reward you, Seifriede, finest knight, but I fear you may not resist the dragon." Please, gentlemen, this is German poetry. - I'm sorry. - No! Never apologize! Come on! And? - Yes, it's pretty nice. - Pretty nice? It's good. Really good. Remember what I said. You box to K.O. today. It's either you or him. If you make it to the third round you have a realistic chance. Get him! Friedrich, go get him! - Come together. - You can take him down! You know the rules. Victory by K.O. To your corners. Knock him out! Box! Boy, watch your cover! Stop. Stop. Alright? Box! Hit him! Hit him! Go on, hit him! You fight till K.O.! Victory by K.O.: Friedrich Weimer! Congratulations, my boy. A great fight. - Thank you. - Such a performance after such a short time here! You set a fine example. If we can beat Potsdam this winter, I could get you into the Reich Sports Academy. There'll be Olympics again. Keep it up. - We have high hopes for you. - Thanks. Thank you very much. - What? - Nothing. Congratulations. Thanks. Didn't you feel any pity? He was already on the ropes. Why? He'd have done the same. I saw him just now. He still hasn't really come to. What do you want? You'd rather I was out cold? You didn't have to be so brutal. - Aren't you happy for me? - Sure. But I wonder if it could be done differently. No, it couldn't. Get up! Siegfried! - Where're you running to? - The bathroom. Turn around. You're a disgrace to the academy. Aren't you ashamed? What if the Fuhrer came and your room stank of piss? - What will the trainer say? - Please don't. I... - 20 Reich marks and I'll forget. - I don't have that much. Get it! If you don't have it by dinner, the trainer will hear of it. You alright, Siegfried? A hand grenade's fragmentation is concentrated mainly in a 15 meter circle. But individual fragments can fly much further. To summarize the procedure: Unscrew the cap, pull the string, and it's live. With a broad sweep wind up, throw and get under cover. Don't forget, you have four and a half seconds till detonation. Any questions? Alright. Christoph, come. And... Pull! Wind up! Throw! Cover! Very good. Next. Friedrich, come. And... Pull! Wind up! Throw! Cover! Wilhelm! And... Pull! Wind up! Throw! Cover! Albrecht, come. And... Pull! Wind up! Throw! Throw it! Cover! God damn it! Martin, come. And... Are you crazy? Throw it! Our governor has come personally to pay his last respects to our fallen hero. We are gathered here today to honor your comrade Siegfried Gladen. He sacrificed himself for the common good in an exemplary manner in a moment of grave danger. He gave his life to save the lives of 20 comrades. The cadet who lies in this coffin did not hesitate in those last seconds of his life. He acted! Hesitant thinking is not called for in these times. Aesthetes are not needed in this hour! We need boys who act! Every one of you here should ask yourself why you didn't throw yourself on that grenade. Each one of you should ask yourself whether you value your life more than your comrades'. And if you do, why? Our bodies are no longer our own. They belong to the folk, to our country and, most of all, to our Fuhrer! And what, what could be more glorious than a heroic death? Siegfried Gladen! The folk thank you and will not forget you. You can go lower! I can't believe this! And nineteen, and twenty... You can do more than you think. - And 22... - No pretending to be tired! And twenty three, and twenty four, and twenty five... And up! Cadets! Today we will work on the high jump. This is one of my very favorite sports. The high jump requires total physical control. The stomach muscles are strained to the limit and are hard as a board. They get you over. If your stomach muscles fail, so will you. Hard as a board. Who wants to try? Weimer, you're the boxer. Like a board. Hit me. Come on, man... Alright. Line up for the first jump! That was brave of you. Would you like to come with me this weekend? It's my father's birthday. - Heil Hitler, Herr Stein. - Heil Hitler, Johann. Albrecht! Finally you're here. So nice you're here. You must be Friedrich. We've heard so much. Thanks for inviting me. - Of course. - Mother, I... - Tell me later, yes? Come on, show me your room. - Not bad. - Yes, it was all already here. - The whole house? - Yes. Quick, quick, quick! "Three cheers for him, three cheers for him, three cheers!" Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah! Thank you. I'm very moved. All my love. Good evening, Father. Congratulations on your birthday. Thank you, Albrecht. You're getting thinner. - Don't you exercise? - Of course. - This is Friedrich. You know, the... - But of course! I've heard about your boxing. Welcome. Dearest Heinrich, in the name of your old comrades-in-arms. Congratulations. And also for your good start in the Warthegau. May you live up to your reputation and really clean up around here! Cheers, Heinrich! To you! Health! Cheers! Dearest Father, I took the liberty of writing you a birthday poem. "The Essence of Things: Once..." Thanks, Albrecht. Thank you. We should do this later. Dear Franz, honored fellow party members. I thank you for your welcome. I can honestly say that my important role here fills me with pride. I know my position has been undermined in Berlin, that some disagree with my methods, but the Fuhrer still decides, not the bureaucrats! Cheers! - Cheers, Heinrich! - Cheers! Karl! Wilhelm! Franz! Cheers! - How's your military training going? - Fine. Albrecht will go to the Waffen-SS when he graduates. Oh, have they relaxed the physical requirements? So you're the boxer, yes? - I hear he's in good shape. - Really? - Maybe you can show us later? - Excellent idea! Gentlemen, join me in the cellar after dinner. Our young elite wants to entertain us with a show. Excellent idea! God, what's all this? Pretty good, huh? I try to keep in shape myself. Come on, get undressed. - Undressed? - Yes. Show us what you've learned. - But Governor, Albrecht isn't... - Nonsense. Any German boy can. And... box! What's this? Put up a fight, boy! Don't go easy on him. - Fight for real. - Yes. Come on. Get started. - Hit me. - No! Hit me, damn it! Hit me, damn it! Fight me! Out! - Don't worry. Excellent punch. - Really terrific. Hans, get him a schnapps. Our country needs boys like him. A couple more like you on the Eastern front, - and we could wrap that up. Cheers! - Cheers! - But Governor... - No! Call me Heinrich! - Can we go, gentlemen? - Yes, let's go. Listen, Albrecht... Attention! Face the eighth column! Cadets, I have good news. The army asked some Napolas for help because of the air war. The eighth column has volunteered to help the Luftwaffe in flak duty. Our senior class will be helping to protect hard-pressed cities in the Reich against the enemy. It fills me with special pride that our final-year cadets are following this call to duty without any concern for the danger involved. Heil Hitler, cadets! Heil Hitler, Headmaster! We're finally rid of him. - How long are you going to sulk? - I'm not sulking. I'm afraid. Of what? Friedrich! Wake up! What is it? Your father. Let's go! March, march! Fall in! Attention! Governor. Seventh column fully present. - Heil Hitler, cadets! - Heil Hitler, Governor! At ease. Cadets, this is the situation: A POW transport caught fire in the Allenstein station. A dozen Russians escaped into the forest near Karlstadt. They strangled two guards and took their weapons. No one knows the area as well as you. I'm asking for your help. Do you want to help us with this dangerous, exciting task, and capture these wild hordes? If so, say, "Yes, Governor!" Yes, Governor! Then let's go! Hurry! Take your own ammunition. - Live ammunition? - Do you want to catch them by hand? Let's go, hurry up. Next! Go! Go! Get in. Move it out! Cadets! Give your best and don't let them get away! I will recommend the best group for the war medal of honor. Load! Safety off! And go! March! March! Stop! Don't move! - Stop! Stay where you are! - Stop or I'll shoot! I saw them. One had something in his hand. They're... children. First aid kit! Quick! - What's he saying? - I don't know. It's no good. Albrecht! It's alright. It's alright. You'll be alright. You'll be alright. You'll be alright. He's dead. So what? Let's get out of here! What's going on? Report, cadet. Governor. Four POW's shot while escaping. - Is that the last one? - Yes. - Move, Albrecht. - It'll be alright. Father, no! Never contradict me in public! Do you understand? Do you understand? Yes, father. Good work, cadets! Keep going. There are plenty more out there. Go! Get a move on! - Governor, we... - Call me Heinrich. Of course, Heinrich. Come on, Albrecht. Keep going. - Pull yourself together! - Pull myself together? Do you know what we just did? You shouldn't have shot! - You shouldn't have shot! - I didn't give the order. Your father said they had guns. - Why are you looking at me like that? - I'm not looking at you. I know what you're thinking! Don't look at me like that! - Albrecht! - Stay here. It's no use. Hey, Weimer. Did you guys shoot them? Hey, tell me! Hey, I asked you a question! Are you deaf? - Break it up. - I'm taking over. Pick up your weapons! Have you gone crazy? You're on duty! Get a move on! Get in. Move! Lie down! This way. Be happy they didn't take you, too. You get out tomorrow. You in there. Christoph? Shut up, Tubby. - But I have to talk to you. - I said shut up, damn it! Attention! Sit down. Get your notebooks. Write an essay. "The winter landscape as it appears in Germanic sagas." You have one hour. Alright. Time's up. Christoph, come and read. Go ahead. "The winter landscape as it appears in Germanic sagas. The winter landscape plays a major part in Germanic sagas." You don't say. "The earliest sources tell us of the immense importance of winter in historic tales." - Enough. Sit down. Albrecht, come and read yours. Go ahead. "As childish as it sounds, the winter time and the sight of freshly fallen snow always fill us with inexplicable joy. Perhaps because as children, we associated it with Christmas. I always imagined myself the hero who killed dragons, rescued virgins and freed the world from evil. As we went out yesterday to find the prisoners, I felt like that little boy who wanted to save the world." Albrecht, stop. "But as we returned, I understood that I am a part of the evil that I wanted to save us from." Albrecht, stop! "Shooting prisoners is wrong. They were not armed, as Governor Stein told us, to incite us. We didn't shoot men, only children." - Out! HEADMASTER What do you have to say? Do you know the situation that you have put me in? I don't think you understand what privileges you enjoy here. What I wouldn't have given to go to a school like this! But I didn't have the chance. At 16, I'd been working for 3 years. And you? You treat all this with contempt. But not anymore. I want you to write another essay and present the facts correctly. Then I expect you to volunteer for the Waffen-SS. I've spoken with Brigadeer Börner. I think the Ukraine is just what you need. - I can't. - What? I can't write the essay. I meant what I wrote. I'll have the essay tomorrow morning. You won't want the alternative. Out! Time's up! - What's going on? - Didn't you hear? Albrecht Stein wrote an essay against his father. What? Albrecht! What happened? I'll be 17 next week. My father's sending me to the Eastern front. I'm also supposed to write an essay to correct my mistakes. Why did you go and write it? I had no choice. - You had no choice? - You didn't, either, when you hit the trainer. - But that was totally different. - Really? But you didn't do anyone any good! - Yes I did. - Who? Explain. I don't get it! I did myself good. Yourself? Can't you think of anyone else? Say something! You selfish bastard! I'll bet it's the first essay of mine that my father has read. What're you going to do now? I don't know. Get up! Let's go! At the lake in 10 minutes! The next time I say, "In 10 minutes at the lake," then I mean in 10 minutes! Is that clear? Alright. You enter this hole and swim to that one. Afterwards, you can wash and eat. Christoph, you first. It won't get any warmer! Christian and Peter! Go to the other hole! Go up to your room! Friedrich next! Come on! Albrecht, your turn. Tjaden is next. Albrecht! Albrecht! Albrecht! No! No! Albrecht! No! No! Oh God! No! No! Albrecht! Albrecht! Albrecht! Too weak. Just too weak. OBITUARY Yes? Friedrich. Nice to see you up and about. Could you please put this in the next edition? No. But... We can't even bury him. You can't just go and... There's no room for a suicide among the Fuhrer's fallen heroes. By the way, his parents agree. They asked me whether I was premature in clearing you of any blame. They noticed a change in their son's behavior since your friendship began. Against my better judgment, I took you under my wing. Never fear, I know how hard you'll fight for us on Saturday. It'll be proof of your belief in our Governor's actions and of your gratitude for the chance you're getting here. Thank you. Dismissed. How are you? Friedrich, what happened in the forest was terrible. And Albrecht's death is a great loss for all of us. But this is about you. About your life and your future. There are teachers from the Reich Sports Academy here. Use this chance! You alright? Kill him. You know the rules. Nothing below the belt. No butting. A clean fight. To your corners. Box! Kill him! Very nice, yes! Get off the ropes! Now, now! Yes! Yes! Get back! One... Two... Three... Four... Box! Box! Undress. Everything. The underpants are ours, too. Dismissed. Quickly, Weimer. Hurry up. Go now! March, march! Until 1945, there were almost 40 Napolas in the 3rd Reich with over 15,000 students. When the war was already a lost cause, they were sent to battle. Fanatical and inadequately armed, they put up bitter resistance. Half of them fell. BEFORE THE FALL
