Twenty years busting my ass to make sure my family has everything. Twelve hours a day. And why? I'm asking you, why? From home to work and back again. I never had an affaire, nothing like that. Poker on Mondays, soccer on Fridays, gym on Tuesday and Thursday. That's it. I'm a model citizen. I mean, I am socially aware. I recycle, I donate to the children's hospital, and what's the point? I'm asking you, what's the point? Watch it! I want you to keep all this in mind when you judge me. The rabbit is burning! It's drowning and burning! I plead not guilty. In any case... am I the only guilty one? Hurray for the bride and groom! Hurray! - Tell me the truth. - Sure. Do I look older than my sister? Where do you get that from? Paul's aunts said so. What did they say? I ran into them in the toilet. They said: "Is true you're younger? I thought you were the oldest one." Paul's aunts are 190 years old and they're always drunk. Yes, but they aren't the first to say that. You worry too much about everything. That's probably the reason. Where's Lolo? Who did you left him with? Paul's aunts. Vera, can you help your sister? Her dress ripped apart again. Tell her I can't go now. She'll have a heart attack. I need to go find Lolo! You know how brides can be, especially your sister! It's okay, I'll do it, Vera. Give me that. Go, go. Go! Go, I mean it. Go with your sister, enjoy. Are you sure? I'm sure, Vera. Give me that. Enjoy. Beautiful! Lolito! How are you, kid? So cute. What? Dad doesn't understand. Tell me. Your bottle? Do you want your bottle? Come to daddy. Come and get your bottle. Yes, come here. Come on your own. Come to daddy. - Come to daddy. - Daddy. It's sort of a family tradition, isn't it? What is? Falling down the stairs. I never fell down the stairs. Yes, you were one, Tato. Lara pushed you. You pushed me. And you pushed Tato. I didn't, I tried to hold on to him. You pushed me. You push yourself, Tato. Who took my shoe? It wasn't me. I'm going to tell mom. I'll tell her you set the living room lamp on fire. And I'll tell her you put make up on Lolo. What? I didn't do that. Can you stop that? What's done is done. That's all in the past and between the three of us. Is that clear? - If it wasn't for me... - I was there when he fell. It's just a bump, Vera. You're overreacting, please. The CT scan was good. Give me back my shoe. I know you have it. - Come on, guys. - Guys, let's go home. - Let's go, Tato. - Let's go, Tato. It's not that big of a deal. It was just a bump. You always have trouble with your shoes! I know! - Bruno took it! - Tato! It's never your fault, but you're always without shoes. No! Don't bother him! Bruno, Lara! Tato! You go outside. Come on, we have to go! I can't find my other shoe, Mom. I'll go out like this. Look for it, Tato. You won't go barefoot. Honey, I don't understand this. Can you help me out with this? Where is my hockey T-shirt, Mom? In the last drawer. Here, take this. From the top or from the bottom? The last one, from the bottom. What's that, Garbo? The contract for all the employees of the Berisso branch. - Mom? - The last one! Come on, Lolo. Your brother's shoe! Isn't there a lawyer in your company? - He's on vacations. - Still? Lawyers do whatever they want, Vera. Didn't you use to be a lawyer, Mom? Yes, in another life. Why did you leave it? Because I did what I wanted to do. Take a look at it, please. The new guys at Legal have no clue. Leave it there, I'll take a look, but I haven't read a contract in 12 years. Hello, Suni, how are you? It's so unusual to see you here, Mr. Víctor. - I'm leaving. - Hi, Suni. - Mom... - Do you have everything? Here, this is yours. - Here, Mom. - No, not like that. On your feet, Lolo. - Get in the car, I'm coming. - Let's go, Lorenzo. Suni, I'm taking the kids to school, and then I'll run some errands. If you need me to buy anything, just text me, I'll take care of it. - Yes. - I'll be back by noon. You can start with the kitchen, it's a mess. Yes, ma'am. Suni, what happened to you? - What do you mean? - You're limping. Why's that? I have one leg shorter than the other. Don't say! Since when? Since I was born, Mr. Víctor. You can have breakfast, Suni. Did you have breakfast? - No. - Go, then. She's been working here for seven years. - Seven years. - Well, I... I didn't know. Will you send me the contract? Shall I also send you my bill? How much do you charge an hour? I charge by the hour and by kid. The dog is free of charge. Have a nice day! Of course, but you keep telling me the same. Yes, I'm tired, because this is not a negotiation, okay? Good morning, Di Caprio. ...and if you don't get it, that's not my problem. Good morning. - Good morning, Lidia! - Good morning, doctor. Next time, remind me to lock the door when Grinberg's grandson is here. - You replaced the glass. - I did. Tell Pachano I want to see the new ideas for the training course. Good. And bring me the tests for the Berisso employees. And arrange a conference call with Mexico. We need to coordinate the regional strategies. And tell Molinari that the dock chairs have rusty nails. - Move, Lidia, hurry up! - Yes, excuse me. Are we still on for tonight? Of course, it's Monday. Tato! Can you put that stick down, please? Aaaahhh! I have no words to thank you what you did for me. That man changed my life. I always did as I pleased and I have no regrets, but when you persuaded me to go that night to the HomeRabbit holiday party... I have no words, but "thanks". So, thanks. This hairdryer hack is great. It gives the coal the right point, so the heat is even. To cook the pork loin, you need an even fire. Otherwise... I didn't want to get married. Especially, not to someone like him. But he's such a loving person. No, Lolo, don't eat sweets, honey. We're going to eat a delicious barbecue dad is doing. You know? I'm tired of traveling. Now, I want to savor the present, - right here, right now. - Mom! Vera! Do you remember when we were kids and wanted to go bag packing to Machu Picchu? I don't remember why you didn't come, what happened? Well, I got pregnant with... What's his name? Bruno. - Mom! - That's why. I didn't remember that. Tato, put that stick down or I'll hit you in the head with it! But you did go, didn't you? Yes, I've been there like five times. And then, I visited both Poles, North and South. Poop. No, Lolo. What did you do? Then, I went to Vietnam and traveled through Southeast Asia. I remember I called you to join me and sent you the airplane ticket, but you couldn't make it. Why was it? Lara was a baby. She was a month and a half. I didn't want to leave her. That's why. Toto really likes chocolate, doesn't he? Yes. Lolo. This one is Lolo. Tato is the one with the glasses. He wants Bianca to stay with her mother and take me to the Amazon rainforest. But I said no. Ah. Throw some salt in here, Lolo. You sure had fun, didn't you? You always had a great time. I remember when Lolo was born. I babysat the other three kids. I almost killed myself. I don't know how you do it, really. If I were you, I'd pull a disappearance act and run away to Machu Picchu. ¡Aaahhh! Mom! You're a moron. Tato, ask mom when she'll set the table. Over. - Dad wants to know... - I heard that. Ow. In five minutes. Well, let's give a big hand to the barbecue chef! - Thank you. - It looks delicious. There's no big hand for the one who made the salads, bought the meat, set the table and did everything else? Why is Bianca having spaghetti? It's match day today and I need to have some carbs. The inter-club championship is around the corner. If she wins, she'll qualify for the Carmelo challenger. So, Bianquita, how are we? - Very focused, aren't we? - Of course, dad. Elena, do you still play tennis? No, not anymore. I'm doing reiki now and a little bit of meditation. I can spend hours like that. I can't eat with you here. Let's trade places. - No. - I was sitting there. But now I'm sitting here. And who are you to take my place? Your older brother. Forget it. Mom doesn't take aunt Elena's place when she leaves the table. What did you say? Nothing. I'm not Elena's older sister, is the other way around. No way. No, really. Yes, where were you all these years? - Aunt Elena is older than mom. - Enough. - It's just mom looks haggard. - Bruno! - Mom is old! - In a good way, I mean. I didn't know she was your sister. There's still pork loin. There's more pork loin. Let's go to bed, Verita. Now I understand. What? Why I look older than my sister. The answer is here. I am the appliance woman. THE APPLIANCE WOMAN "Quite often, the daily routine makes us lose sight of who we are. Making breakfast, cooking dinner, sewing that costume for school, all our kids' activities. 'Stop here, I want to get off the planet!, ' jokes, amused, Mausi de las Nieves, "Marketing Manager." What if I break down one day? If my engine stops and it can't be restarted? What would happen? Nothing. Come here, let's make a connection. Like an appliance. Vera, you're making this into a big deal. You're not an appliance, you're a mother. A little bit upset, who goes through all the things every mother goes through. What do you expect? For people to applaud you? Well, yes. You get applause when you cook three sausages. You're way out of line now. So, let's make this clear. Weren't you the one who, back in the day, decided to stop working to raise our kids? I even offered you to have a live-in nanny and you said: "No, I'd rather have someone for a few hours" twice a week to help me around the house." - Is that true or not? - Yes, it is. - So? - Yes, I didn't want someone else to raise my children. Or what did we have them for? To look at them in a photo on our cell phone? Another low blow? You think going to work is like a holiday to me. Don't you? Do you know how many compromises I have to make? Do you think I don't miss them horribly when I'm out of the house all day? That my heart doesn't break when I get home from poker and they're asleep? Alright. I don't really know what you're complaining about. You just have to take the kids to school. Then, you have lots of free time to do whatever you want. If you want, you can go back to bed. You can sign up for classes, go out with your friends, go to the movies. And you say you feel like an appliance. Then, what am I? You tell me, what am I? I'd give anything to be in your place. Really? Of course! Would you like to be in my place? Of course I would, no doubt about it. Good night. Good night. You could cut that pork loin with a spoon. We have a lot to learn from them. That's the first world. Now, they're branching out on apparel. That's interesting. Tell me, where will they produce it? Bangladesh, Di Caprio. Minimal costs. They know how to do business. - How's Sarita doing? - She's fine, thanks. Send her my regards. Of course. How's your grandson doing, that little rascal? In the hospital. Bronchiolitis. That's bad. Is there a problem, Pachano? Yes, there is a problem. She's from La Pampa, she moved here a few months ago. This is from last night. Gutiérrez, in Security, gave it to me. I checked her records and there's nothing. She never caused any issues. What did she take? Three screws. Three thumb screws. That's fine, Pachano. We'll just give her a warning. Sorry, Garbo, I know this is your area and I don't mean to meddle, but... I think employees need clearer signals. A warning isn't just enough. Today it's three screws, tomorrow is a hostage situation. Yes, I totally agree. When I say a warning is enough, I mean we should take exemplary measures. How much are those screws? 3.20 each, sir. So, I think we should take that money from her salary and give her a suspension... for two days. I was thinking four days. With no pay. And we make her pay for the screws. One week suspension and she pays for 100 screws. 200 screws, and a month suspension. What do you think? Two months suspension with no pay and we charge her for 1000 screws. 2000 screws and three months suspension. Stop beating about the bush, Garbo. Just fire her. Grow a pair, dude. And no severance package for her. Did you go to college in Chicago, Di Caprio? In Pennsylvania, Grinberg. I took you for a Chicago boy. What an honor! Moron. Di Caprio is one of those guys who thinks he's better than the rest. Those guys who never listen when you talk to them. I hate him. Well, that's over. Leave your problems at work. - Food. - Yes, honey. What about you, guys? How was school? Any news? Mourinho quit. - Who's Mourinho? - Manchester's manager. What does that have to do with school? I found out at school. You spent the last two hours talking about a guy nobody knows and we didn't complain. And you're a loser and we didn't complain. What's wrong with you? Well, since we're all here... I want to take this chance to tell you something. - You don't understand anything. - You understand everything. - I'm taking a trip. - Can I have the salt? Please. - On my own. - Mom. "Pennsylvania" he said. Go shut the door, you idiot. Mom, can I have the salt? They say he's going to work for Bayern. "No one knows him." Do you know how many followers he has? - 8,006 followers. - On your own? - Yes. - Mommy is leaving. Mommy is leaving. - Yes. - I'm going to Machu Picchu. Where is Pennsylvania? Okay, you've been warned. What is for dessert? - Yes, fruit. - What fruit? Fruit, because... No, I mean dessert, Mom. Yes, fruit is dessert. I mean, four people are telling you you didn't say anything, but you're so stubborn you claim you did tell us. Well, it's just for a few days, Garbo. Or didn't you go fishing to Entre Ríos a few months ago? That's different. I went fishing, I went looking for food for the family. You didn't even bring chocolate. Where are you going? Machu Picchu, but the package deal includes two nights at the Galapagos. Package deal? - Who are you going with? - Gina, I told you. You're worried. Why, what's the problem? Of course I'm worried, Vera. I have to go to work. I've been working my ass off to get this promotion. Now that I got it, you leave. You're crippling me. Nothing will be decided in ten days, Garbo. Take some days off. You have a lot of vacation days coming up. We're opening the Berisso branch. Do you really need to go now? Didn't you say you wanted to be in my place? Now I understand. Right. You know what? Go. Have some rest, take time off. I'll take vacations from work. It'll be good for me too to rest at home, with the kids. But now go and talk to your children, because they're very upset. Good night. Come here, yes. Here she is, Tatito. Tell mom what you just told me. You can't leave, Mom. Not ten days, not ten minutes, nothing. Why, honey? Because it'd be like the "maroska" is missing a part. The what? - "Mamushka", Tato. - I don't know what that is. It's something you put inside another... Never mind, go inside. Bye. - Will you bring me a drone? - Go inside! Bye, Tato. - Are you scared? - Not at all. Now you're starting to understand, and it's only natural to be scared, you're going into uncharted territory for you. Uncharted territory? This is my home, my kids. What are you talking about, Vera? Let me bring you up to speed. You take Lolo and go to school, to pick Tato up. You take him and his friend Camilo to taekwondo. You leave them there and go to the doctor for Lolo's check-up. Then, you go pick up Lara and you take her and her friend Carmela to their tutoring lessons. While you're waiting, at the bookstore downstairs, you can buy the class notes Bruno needs for school. You wait five or ten minutes for Bruno to finish his guitar lesson, he doesn't like to be picked up at the door. You get everyone on the car and you come home. Monday is easy. Now, let's go through Tuesday. Here, you should start practicing. Bye, Cuco. Have a good trip, Mom. Have fun. Thanks, princess. Mom, can I throw a party? Ask your father. - Yes, I can throw a party. - No. - Yes, I can throw a party. - I said no! I left this week's menu for Suni, it's on the fridge. Yes. And limit their use of technology. Please. I talked to them about it, but pay attention. - Fine. - What else? I'll add you to the WhatsApp groups with the other mothers from school. - That's not necessary. - It's 25 kids, times four, then it's around 100. To that, you need to add the basketball mothers, the music mothers, the dance mothers and the taekwondo mothers. - Okay. - There you go. Bye, honey. Bye, Mom. - Come here. - Go to daddy. - Bye, honey. - Bye, darling. You relax. Don't worry. Bye, Lolo! Bye, Lolo. Bye! Tato, are you okay? Alright. Vera... What are you doing up? Come on, Bruno. Time to wake up, come on. Come on, Tato, wake up. Come on, honey. - Dad... - That's it, up. Help me out. Good. Bruno! Where are your...? I'll be with you in a minute. I need a plate. Help me out here. Come on, guys! Hurry! - Good morning. - Hello. - Good morning, Suni. - How are you, Suni? Hi, Suni. Get in the car, I'll be right there. - Hello. - How are you? - Hello, cutie. - Listen... This week, could you come every day, all day long? Yes, yes, I already talked to Vera about it, Mr. Víctor, - I won't leave you hanging now. - Thank you so much. You can start with... where... Wherever you want. Take a turn now. Right or left? Go straight. - Straight? - Yes, turn right. - Shall I go straight or turn? - Turn right. Dad! Take care of the car, dad. Or was it left? I can't believe you don't know where your school is. I can't believe you don't know where our school is. But you go there every day. Mom drives us, we're usually asleep. I take this hand I make it dance I close it, I open it I put it away - Bye? Bye? - No. Shall we say "Bye" to dad? No. Well, then daddy stays a little while longer. Okay? - Yes. - No, but... Why can't I leave, Lolo? Every kid has their own rhythm. Okay, fine. Yes. Because of this unforeseen event my wife had I'll need to take a few days off. Bad timing, Garbo. We're opening Berisso's branch. I know, but that's in 20 days. I gave instructions to my team and I'll supervise from home, if it was necessary. Don't worry about that. Ice tea? My treat, Di Caprio. Allow me, please. Well... In the States, these machines take bills, here they only take coins. Allow me, please. Here, they take kicks. What? "Compartment one is used for the pre-washing soap," and it can also be used for bleach. Compartment two can be used for regular soap "or for liquid soap. In this case..." Where did you go first? The vet or the hospital? Yes, honey. I told you already. So, where should I pour this? Dad, who came first? Nero or Caligula? I'll look it up! - No, don't, Tato. - Tato... - Bruno, I went all the way to Villa Luro to get you those class notes, can't you come up the stairs to pick them up? No. Unbelievable. Which compartment, then? One. Or two. Fine, but how can I tell compartment one from two? How will we manage without Suni for a month? Lara, she said she'd send us a cousin's friend's daughter to help us out. We'll see. If we all do what we're supposed to, everything will be fine. Well, I'm going to miss Suni. There it is. - I guess that's it. What now? - Press the green button. They're all green. The start button. - The button. - There it is. - Tato! - What? - Can you throw down my bag pack? - Alright! Catch it! Tato! No, no... - You'll pay for it. - It wasn't me, it was Lolo. Calm down, boys, please. You'll hurt yourself. You'll hurt yourself! So? I don't understand you, Lolo. What is he saying? He wants to draw. Fine, he can use the blue notebook. Not the walls or the furniture. The blue notebook, Lolo, okay? - Will you answer? - You can ask me for the moon or the brightest star in the sky and I'll bring them down for you. But, please, don't ask me where your birth certificate is, because I have no idea. Lolo, I said not on the walls. Well, then, at least tell me what time I was born, dad. - Night time. - When, exactly? - I need the exact time. - What for? To have my natal chart done. 9:22. Nine hours, 22 minutes. - You're making it up. - Yes. And, please, don't leave your clothes on the floor, okay? - Here. - This? It isn't mine. It's now? And whose is it? I don't know, Garbo. You find out. What are you doing here? Why didn't you tell me you were coming? What are you doing? Nothing, I was just studying. - With whom? - No one. I'm going to kill you! Why? Stop, stop, give me that. Give me that, please. You're such a drag. Go downstairs and play something else. Let's go downstairs. Can you tell me who the hell is there with you? I'm alone, I told you. Do you want to check my room? And lower your voice, you're in the wrong here. You weren't supposed to be here. Really? And where was I supposed to be? Urban dancing. See? After taking Lolo to his swimming lessons, you were supposed to pick up Tato and Tomás and take Lara to her urban dancing lesson. You were supposed to come home 8:30, not 6:15. If you're coming back earlier, let me know. I can't believe it. I love urban dancing so much. Then why didn't you go? He didn't tell me today was Tuesday. Wait, do I need to tell you everything? Yes, dad. - What do you want, Tomás? - Kid, he's talking to you. I'm not Tomás. I'm Ramiro. This is Ramiro. Tomás is the fatty redhead who's a fan of Newell's. What? What? Why didn't you tell me? - What? - Stay here. Tomás? Come on. Hello! How are you? Did you win? Well... - Where do you live? - Villa Luro. Keep straight, I'll let you know. Can you tell me why Lolo is not in his crib, Bruno? Unbelievable. Teacher's training day? Strike. You're going on strike today. No, it's a teacher's training day. We told everyone by WhatsApp. So, please, calm down. I am calm. Do you see me upset? Open the door or I'll get the car in too. What did you say? Nothing, nothing. I'm calm. But I am confused, because you're not selling candy here. You can't just say "I won't open today." I understand the unions struggle, and that's all very important, but it's the future or our nation we're talking about. Children need education! And if we go on strike for every little thing, when will that end? Tell me! - Tell me! - I said we're not on strike! Wait. Where should I take them now? Wait, kid. Tell me, where? - I don't know, sir. - Where? Please, keep them for a while. They don't make a mess. Look at them, they're nice. Look, Lolo, look. The littlest one is not a problem, there's no teacher's training day for kindergarten. You can drop him off. What you're feeling now is what I feel every day, but times 1,500. Do you know how I looked like before I went into teaching? A supermodel! And look at me now! But you went into teaching, why is that my fault? And you went into parenting! "You went into parenting!" Did you hear that? Fine, that's fine. We need to drop Lolo off. Yes, drop him off. Let's go. Go play with the kids. Go on. - No, no. - I'm out, I'll be right back. No, no, no, no. Stay a little while longer. Sure, here we are. Which compartment should I put the soap in for a quick... wash? Compartment one, two and three. Thank you, thank you. In a couple of minutes we'll be off for the Inca road. Everything is going great. But never mind, you tell me. - We are... - We are great! We are fine, we are great. We're doing great, aren't we? Honestly, they're having a great time. Don't worry about us. They're coming for me. - I have to go. - Okay, okay. Tell Lara I love her. Yes, yes, I'll tell her when she gets out of the bathroom. What about Suni? And Cuco? Does he miss me too? Cuco is great, fatter than ever. So enjoy yourself and don't worry about anything. Hi, Lolo! Hi. Hello! Hello. - I miss you. -We miss you too. Bye. - Bye, Mom! -Love you, bye. - Bye, bye! -Bye, Mom! I have news for you. Grinberg is retiring. What are people saying? Who will replace him? Rumor has it, it'll be Buzz. Who? Me? No, of course not, dude. Buzz Lightyear. That's how we call Di Caprio in the warehouse. I can't believe it. Di Caprio? He's been working here for six months! I've been here 15 years! Well, yes, but he came from Michigan. Besides, you have to admit he was right about those Chinese deck chairs. - What? - He wants to watch cartoons. - Cartoons. - - Speaking of China... Do you know who had an accident with her bike? China Papaleo. So, now, Bianquita is the third player qualified for the finals. All she does is train. She's with her racket day and night. Last night... - I was telling her... -Check mate. Alright, alright. - We'll talk tomorrow. - Check, check mate. No, no, no, no, Tato. It's not check mate. The horse moves three that way, and one that way, I told you a thousand times, Tato. Let's play something else. No, we already played everything three times. Watch some TV. Lolo is watching. - Use your tablet. - The battery died. Well, then, you can use my laptop. - Yes! Yes, yes, yes. - I'm going to the toilet. What is "X Videos"? Nothing, it's nothing. Nothing. It's just... What is "MILF"? MILF? "MILF" is... A group... Fundamentalist... It's politics, it's not interesting. I told you those palm hearts were expired, dad. Palm hearts don't expire, Bruno. Your stomach aches, that's all. Did mom call? No, no, no. Mom... I mean, yes. She sends her love. But she's not here, I'm here. What's wrong? I need to talk to her. Mom is not here. I'm here. Talk to me. No, I can't talk to you about this. - Why? - Because. You can talk to me about anything, trust me. - Do you really want to know? - Of course. I found blood in my clothes. In my underwear. And what's the problem? I just put a load on. When it's done, I'll wash your clothes. It's my period, dad. What period? You know. I don't know, Lara, what are you saying? - What, dad? - What are you talking about? I got my first period, you moron. Honey! That is... Extraordinary. It's... It's... It's... That's wonderful, it's something... Is something extraordinary. It's like that movie with the little fish. When was the last time we all went together to the movies? What are you talking about, dad? What are you talking about? Why do you talk to me like that? What do you want me to say? You need to talk about this with your mom. - I'm a man. - That's what I've been saying! Stop, stop. Calm down. Honey, this is... What you're going through is beautiful. It is life itself, unfolding in front of your eyes. Don't worry. It's natural... There, right in front of your eyes. Wait. I'll help you in a minute. How to proceed about the first period? You're such a moron. - No, no, honey, forgive me. - You're stupid. But I need to figure this out for you. Honey... Let's calm down, please. Okay, guys. Mom won't be here for another week. So... I think we should all calm down. If we have any problems, even what you just told me about, we'll fix it together. But... Let me see... What the hell do I care about the taekwondo party? Okay... I wanted to tell you that... There's foam coming down the stairs. I told you those palm hearts were expired. I quit. What do you quit? You can't quit. Well, then give me a break. I'll go and fix everything in a minute, but, please, I really need to get some fresh air. What are you doing with that? When did you start smoking again? I'll be brief. If you take one drag on that cigarette, you'll never see us again. Let that go. Lolo! Lolo! Garbo, snap out of it! Lolo is inside, locked in, with all the foam. I want you to know something. I've been trying to poop for four hours without any luck. Who's stopping you? We need to call mom. Mom? Do you know why she left? To show us we can't live without her: And she's right. No, she's not right. Keys. Yes, she's right. Lolo! Lolo! Lolo, listen to me! Get away from the foam! - Away, away from the foam. - Hello, dad! No, I'm not waving! I'm telling you to get away from the foam! Don't rub that in your eyes! Lolo, Lolo! Listen to me carefully! Listen to dad, listen. Tato, stop tearing the house down! A stick! Sit down, Lorenzo. Sit down. God. Stop. This is a bad idea. Did thinks he's Spider-Man, but I think he'll fall on his head. - Hello. - Hello. Hi, how are you? I'm Julia. I'm the daughter of Suni's neighbor's cousin. - Hi, Julia. - Hi. - How are you? - Tato. - Lara. - Bruno. You know, we're in the middle of something. Lorenzo, the youngest one, got locked in, we left our keys inside, and dad is trying to crawl through the window, but we don't know what we're... No, no, don't worry! No, I have keys! My dear, can you tell the doctor we're here, - and he's awake, please? - Yes, sir. This smells. What happened? What were you doing on your roof, Víctor? Where are my kids? Don't worry. They were here all night, I told them to go home. I told them you're alright. Now the doctor will probably discharge you. You shat yourself inside the CT scanner. No way! Apparently, you broke it down. It is really sensitive technology. Doctors were insulting you. "We'll transfer him now, we'll transfer him." Here. Try this on. Let's see if it fits. What about my kids? Who are they with? With that girl. She's very smart, I liked her. Children! Daddy's home! Hello! Guys! - Hi! - How are you? - Fine, how are you? - I'm fine, fine, fine. - Sorry. - No, no. Is everything alright? Yes, yes. What were you doing? Just studying. Alright. Keep it up then. Hello, Lara. - Hello, dad. - How are you? How are you? Hello. - You look so nice. - Thanks! - Hello, Lolo. - Hi, how are you? I'm Julia. Your kids are great. Thank you. - Dad! - Hello! My favorite Tato! What a nice mask you have, little monster! There you go! She's Suni's neighbor's cousin's daughter. And she's great. She helped me study, called the electrician - and cleaned up the house. - She likes video games. And she can come every day. No... I don't understand, Lolito. What did you say? He says he wants more juice. Sir. Yes? I have to go, it's time. I left dinner ready. I made some pasta for Bruno, he said he'd been having an upset stomach. And I talked to Lara about her... thing. But I think it'd be nice if you supported her. And one more thing. I hope you don't take offense, okay? But, after watching them, I think you should limit their use of technology. Well, sorry, I have to go, I'm late for school. What are you studying? Radiology. No, that's wrong. No, no. "Management technician in agribusiness." Right. It's just that I used to study Radiology. Before Dental Technician. And then, I went into Sports Journalism. I was branching out. And then, I got the bug. Dengue. I spent a month in bed, and when I woke up, I said: "Right, this is what I need to study." What was it? That's fine, that's fine. I guess you're a very curious girl. Yes. Well, I don't know. One more thing. These are... the phone numbers of the houses where I worked before. Okay. Did you always work at family houses? Well... No, sorry. I can't lie. No, up until last week I was working as a janitor at the HomeRabbit store in Sarandí. You don't say. But I quit. No, that's a lie. I was fired. Do you know why? Because I took three thumb screws. Do you know how many they keep in storage? 25 million units! They're capable of firing someone for three stupid thumb screws! And I didn't even want to steal them. It was five in the morning, there was no one around. The next day, I tried to explain to my supervisor, but he said: "No, no, no. The order comes directly from the Human Resources manager." What kind of person fires someone for three thumb screws? Someone... without a family. He can't have a family. Or, if he has it... What kind of father is he? A monster. I'm speechless. And you know what's funny? They're not the right screws. I didn't even get that right. What do you do? Me? You're a lawyer. What? I saw all your law books. Yes, right, exactly. Yes, I'm a lawyer, yes. Yes, I have a firm downtown. Yes, you look like it. Downtown, I mean. Well, see you tomorrow. Hello. Hello, Lara. Well, how can I...? No... I wanted to tell you... I'm fine, dad. Julia already explained. No, that's fine, but if you want... Okay, great. And speaking of Julia. Strange girl, isn't she? I mean, I like her. But something doesn't add up. I don't know what. She talks too much. Maybe we should think of someone else. If you fire Julia, I'll learn how to drive and run you over. No, no, right, okay. Yes, yes, it was just a thought. You're leaving Lolo! You're leaving Lolo! - Take care of the car, Dad! - Yes. I forgot about Lolo. Yes, yes, I forgot about Lolo. Now... I was coming to get him. To sum up: the employee thinks I'm a lawyer and my kids think I'm a moron. Why a lawyer? I don't know, because of Vera. All her books were there, in the bookcase. What should I tell her? "I'm the monster who fired you for three thumb screws, nice to meet you"? I just signed off on it. It was Grinberg and that miserable Di Caprio, always meddling, trying to score some points. Paul, come to the warehouse. Right away, sir. So, why are you here? I came to pick up my new cell. And score some points. Is Grinberg here? I don't know, I haven't seen him. But go back home, enjoy your family. Does it seem like I'm enjoying my family? Didn't you say that girl is great and takes care of everything? Well, then take a nap, watch a movie, a soccer game. I don't know, enjoy. Okay? If you complain, what's left for me? My only hope left is Bianquita. I hold on to that. If I let go, I'll fall into an infinite hole. And now, Elena is leaving me. What do you mean? - You got married a month ago. - She started doing reiki. A woman who starts doing reiki or goes to Machu Pichu is sure leaving you. Great, Paul. So not only my children think I'm a moron, my wife is also leaving me. Hello! Grinberg! Is everything alright? How's Sarita doing? She's at the hospital. She had a stroke. That's bad. What are you doing, doctor? Nothing. Nothing... You? How are your vacations with your kids? Honestly? Great, Lidia. - It's like we're at Disney. - Good, good. The beverage company confirmed the delivery - for the day after tomorrow. - I don't follow. The company's family day, doctor. I had totally forgot about it. But I don't know if my kids will want to go. The whole board is going. Di Caprio already confirmed he's going with his family. Here. This is Di Caprio's family? Don't get scared, doctor. We need to burn all the bridges, this is our last chance. It's now or never. Okay... I won't deny these days without mom have been a challenge. For all of us. We started off on the wrong foot. Right? But... we can blame each other - or... - Is that thing safe? Yes, Toto, it is... Tato... I'm talking. I can't understand you, Lolo. If you're not clearer, it's hard for me. I was just saying I want to make a fresh start. Let's take this as a rebirth and let's all merge together in this balloon as a family... and take flight, metaphorically, of course, - as if it was... - Isn't that dangerous? Cut to the chase, Garbo. Fine. In this humble ceremony, after we wrote down our wishes in these pieces of paper... let's throw this beautiful balloon into the air Well, you get it. I asked... for... everyone to find what they're looking for in life. I asked for Julia to make us pancakes. For mom to come back. Peace and love. And I also asked... that we have a good time tomorrow, at family day, in Pilar. - It's closer than... - Forget about it. - Than last year. - No way. Last year, it was General Rodríguez. It's closer now. The house is burning down, dad! Take care of the house, dad! Call the firemen, Tato! Are you coming to the family day? No. Tato is a good son, and he's coming, but only if one of you two is coming too. And if you buy me a new PlayStation! Yes, right. - And a drone! - I already said yes. But you said it a lot of times and never did it. Tato, go brush your teeth! Whatever you want, ask me anything you want. Tell me. Let's do this: you tell me. What? Tell me three things that I like and I'll be there. You can't mention ice cream, my cell phone or the color black. That's what I thought. Lara, honey. Let's agree on something. No. Let's, at least, agree on something. I'm taking a shower. You can ask me for anything you want, Bruno. I want to throw a party here. No way. What? I can't understand you. What are you trying to say, Lolo? No... Don't paint on the walls, Tato. It's not me, it's Lolo! Is it that hard for you to spend a field day with your father? - Yes. - Why? Because you don't know how to be with us. Me? It's you who don't know how to be with me! You don't even know what time I was born, you know nothing. I told you, honey! When I was a kid, my father, your grandfather, would say one thing and that thing was respected. He didn't have to ask and... I want mom! - Lorenzo. Lorenzo, stop it. - What? Stop it, Lorenzo. - I want... - No, no. - I want mom! - We all want mom. I want mom! Stop, Lorenzo. Stop for a minute, okay? Can you stop crying? There you go. For crying out loud. Dad. I'm going. Just for a little while. You can thank Julia. Good morning. Good morning, Garbo. How was the teacher's training day? Very good, very good. No, you don't need to thank me. I told you that if you kept trying to convince them was probably because it was very important for you to go there with them. That was all? Yes, I'm sorry. I was nosy, wasn't I? No, no, no. You did well. Thank you. Really, I appreciate it. I owe you. No. It wasn't that hard. Well, but all the same. If you need anything, just tell me. Maybe something for your house. If you need a mattress, shower curtains, a deck chair. Don't hesitate to ask me. - Really? - Of course, yes. Don't be embarrassed, Julia. Okay. I have all the paperwork here. Pay slips, termination notice, everything. I want to sue HomeRabbit. - What? - Yes. I worked there for three months and got paid under the table. They fired me without a severance pay. I have lots of witnesses. And now life, amazingly, puts a lawyer in my path! Sir, I'm talking to you. What do you think? No, yes, right. Isn't it better to leave the past behind and start over? No way! Leave it behind? No! I want corporations to pay! I want to set a precedent. Before and after. Besides, I talked to my coworkers at the store and we thought about taking forcible actions. Strike, occupying the store and this one is the main one: a public demonstration at the home of those responsible. We want them to pay. It's not easy to get their names, they're like a secret society. But you don't worry. I have someone on the inside who's getting the information for me. No, no, no. Julia, don't worry. Don't do any of that. Leave all the paperwork with me and I'll take on the case. I'll do it. - You will? - Yes. Yes, I will. I knew it! I knew I could trust you, because you can tell when someone is a good person, you know? - Well... - So, how do we do it? - No, a certified letter. - Yes. And we'll wait to see what they do. And we'll operate accordingly. Good. Thank you. You're welcome. You still haven't left the house? What are you waiting for, doctor? My children are hard to wake up. - Is Di Caprio there? - Of course. He's been lobbying to the board for half an hour. Half an hour already? And you haven't seen his family, - they're so much better live. -What do you mean? They're amazing. - Amazing? - -They're so cute! They fall asleep in anyone's arms. Wait until they see my artillery. When did you last shower, Tato? Before mom left, Garbo. Stop that! Let's go! Come on, team. Come on. Like a real family. It'll be before and after family day. - Hello. - Hi, Julia. Hello, Lolito! Hi, Tato. Do you want to come to the family day? No, no, she can't come. Get in the car. What are you doing here? I mean, it's your day off today. No, I know, but yesterday after we photocopied my ID, I left it here. Don't worry. If Bruno's home, I can just go in. No, he's still asleep. Guys, get in the car, I'll be right back. Okay, come with me. I'm so sorry. No problem, you left your ID here, you need it. Where is it? Sir, let me ask you. Did you already sent that letter? Yes, yes. No, not yet. We're taking it step by step. Okay, because I've been thinking about what we talked last night. And.. What's that? What's this? Just something Tato and Lolo gave me. It's beautiful. It is. No, well, I was thinking about what you told me, you know? What if the company gave me my job back? Yes, that could be a good solution. No. No, it's not a good solution. I don't ever want to go back to work there. I don't ever want to set foot in there. Just the thought of going there... When I think about that stupid rabbit, their mascot, I just want to see it burn. And I think about that and... Look how I get when I tell you about it. - My skin crawls. - I see. I want them to pay. But I want them to really pay. Because they exploit people, you know? Of course, I understand you. Here it is. Do you work at HomeRabbit? No. Why would you think that? HOMERABBIT IS A BIG FAMILY I don't know how... I mean... How can I explain this? Human Resources Manager. I don't have a lot of input. It's a minor position. Human Resources Manager? You stole three thumb screws. I can't believe it. I can't... I can't believe it! First of all, calm down. Second, keep your voice down. Why did you offer to be my lawyer? I didn't offer. You asked and I said yes. - Same thing! - It's not the same. It doesn't matter, anyway, because I'm not a lawyer. So you were laughing at me this whole time. No, no one was laughing at you, Julia. Why? Why didn't you tell me? Why? Well, because... my children liked you, because I was overwhelmed by this situation and, besides, because I was embarrassed to tell you the truth. Embarrassed? Embarrassed why? It's not like you fired me yourself. Let's go out, okay? You did fire me yourself? For heaven's sake. It was you? You...? No, no... No, no, no, no, no. What an idiot! Don't punish yourself. I'm not talking about me. I'm talking about you! What a stupid guy! Get a grip, girl, this is my house! Do you want to know the truth? Yes, it was me who fired you for three stupid thumb screws! And if it makes you feel good to blame me or that stupid rabbit, then do it. But take my advice. Next time you take something that isn't yours, make sure there are no cameras right above your head. Those screws were three pesos each! - You stingy bastard! - It doesn't matter! For the cruel world out there, that is wrong! You're right. I don't fit in in the cruel world out there, but do you want to talk about the cruel world in here? You have no idea who your children are, dude. The difference between us is that you still haven't been caught. But wait until they put a camera in here. - My ID. - Yes. What are you doing here, Bruno? I changed my mind. Let's go to the family day. Okay, fine. Come on, let's go to the family day. So, you have to score a point here, a point there, little by little. Maybe I'll make manager. I don't know if that's what I really want, but you need to score points for that. So, maybe, eventually... -Rabbit! -I'll get to manager and... - Give me a minute. -Here it comes! There it comes our rabbit! Let me tell you, I love the energy you're all bringing to this special day. And now, our mascot, Tony, will light the torch for these family Olympics at HomeRabbit. Let's make the countdown. Will you help me out? What happened? Why did you push him like that? Seven, six, five... four... - Are you okay? - three... two, one... zero. Yes! And now, let's play! Well done, Tony! Great flame! Now! I won! Come on, keep up the good work! Now! You started sooner, Di Caprio. Focus, Lidia. - What are we waiting for? - The right time. Are you seeing what I'm seeing? Get me out of here! The ball! Lara, a little bit more energy, kid. Blue team, 32. Red team, 64. Double the points! So, our captain, Mr. Grinberg, will hand the first medal to Mr. Di Caprio, the captain for the red team. Let's give them a big hand. Dad, the bowling game gives a lot of points. So, Lidia? Go for it. No way. You go for it, Garbo. I don't know. Okay, make sure you hit it right in the middle. Don't you worry. Are you ready? Yes, yes, of course. First, we want to tell you something. It was good that mom took this trip. It helped us to know each other more. Exactly, yes. And we reached a conclusion. You are under a lot of stress. And we think you deserve to go on a nice trip too. Alright. We already booked your tickets and everything. I don't understand, what are you saying? We're saying hold on tight, thumb screw. What? What? What do you know? What did you hear? No, let me explain something. Tato! Tato! Bruno! Three, two, one...! Easy, Pachano. It's very easy. Garbo, do something! Snap out of it! We took it too far. Someone help the rabbit! The rabbit is drowning! The rabbit is drowning and burning! It'll be better for everyone, let's do this. The kids will come home with me. They'll stay with me until Vera comes back. Do you understand? Do you want me to take Lolo too? Sure? Sure, yes. I'm sure. What, Lolo? I can't understand you, Lolo. I haven't understood you since you were born. I can't understand anything, kid. Yes, Lidia. I'm sorry to bother you. The board wants to have a meeting with you at five today. Are you listening, doctor? Yes, yes, yes. Tell them I'll be there. Okay? LARA GARBO WAS BORN ON SEPTEMBER 24TH, 2003 AT 9:22 Shall we say "bye" to daddy? Bye, daddy. Bye, daddy. Wave at him. - Bye, daddy. - Bye, daddy. - Bye, daddy. - Bye. - Tell him. - Bye, daddy! Daddy is gone. - Yes, he's gone. - Daddy is gone. Where are you going? Bernasconi. It's a small town in La Pampa. That's where I'm from. Don't worry. I'm not going to sue you. You even took that drive away from me. Actually, I don't even know a lawyer. My wife is a lawyer. I can give you her number. So that I can sue you? She'd say yes in a heartbeat. Trust me. Why are you here? I came here... to apologize, Julia. And to try to solve what I did to you, somehow. Listen, I know a lot of people and I can find you a job. I mean... You don't have to leave. You're smart, you're good, you have potential. I could find you something in your field of studies. What was it you were studying? - Management techni... - Okay, never mind. You have a future ahead of you. I'm sick and tired of the future. You know? I think the future is the worst invention ever. Nice. I bought it at a fair. It's for my son. That's what the screws were for. I didn't know you had a son. He lives back home, with my mom and my grandma. He's five. His name is Dante. Look. He's cute. No, he's not very cute, poor thing. They call him "the rat boy." Besides, he's naughty, just like his father. But he's mine. And this is now. True. This is now. Very true. Well... There it is. The arm is on. Little by little, we're piecing him together. So, as soon as Michigan approval comes through, we'll make it official, and Mr. Laureano Di Caprio will be appointed as my replacement for the General Manager position. As for you, Garbo, due to the unfortunate events that took place yesterday, this board has made a decision. No one is doubting your skills or your commitment to this company for the last 15 years. But we consider it wouldn't be convenient to keep you as our Human Resources Manager. So, we have decided, unanimously, to transfer you to the department of Institutional Relations. We sincerely believe that is the best solution. So, from now on, you'll be working under the orders of doctor Valdivia here. Let's go home. Let's go home. Excuse me? I said, from now on, you'll be working under... Yes, just a moment. You'll tell me later. Let's go home. Let's go home. Let's go home. - Yes! - Listen, Garbo... - Let's go! - from now on... Let's go home. You'll be working - under the orders of doc... - Yes, yes, yes. Well, say "cornet." Cornet. Say "banana". Banana. This is crazy! Did you hear that? Say "sausage." Sausage. I can understand everything! This guy went crazy. - Say "motorbike". - Motorbike. He said "motorbike." - Curtain. - Curtain. You're fired, Víctor Garbo. Stupid rabbit. I love you. Let's go, Lolo. - Will you come with me? - No. Fine. Do you want to stay here? - I want to stay here. - Then, stay. What will you do now, doctor? I don't know, I'll think about it. I'll start my own business, I guess. No, I mean... My nephew is a shrink. Do you want me to give you his number? I'll let you know. Lidia, I don't have a PhD. I'm no doctor. I know. And my name isn't Lidia. My mom's name was Lidia Amelia. They called her "Chiche." Really, I can give you his phone. Bye, Lidia. Bye, doctor. Shall we, boss? - Can I take this? - Yes, take it, come on. I may not even cash it. This is garbage. Stupid rabbit. Stupid rabbit. What happened over there? Honey, listen to me. This is total loss we're talking about. No, I'm not okay! No, a man is talking to me here. The car is totally smashed in halves! It's all...! Careful, careful! It's ruined already! Honey, honey! Let me talk, please. I'll send you a photo. Will you let me talk? - There you go. - 15-0. - Let's go! - Hello, Lolo! - Lolo! - Hi, Lolo! Come over here, sweetie! - Come here. - Guys, guys, guys. Hello! - Lolo, Lolo, Lolo. - Quiet, please. Tied! What? What? Nothing, nothing. Nothing. I won't say anything. Although I could say a lot of things. Now you're the one who's offended. Last time we saw each other you put me inside a giant ball. It was Lara's idea. Fine, we went too far. But you were also lousy ever since mom left, admit it. You didn't even know where the school was, dad. Because I wasn't there, I never was. 15-40. Mom left nine days ago. I left a lot longer ago. I'm sorry. We're sorry too. Who are you shushing, ma'am? Can't you see we're having a conversation? I know! You should leave the family therapy for another time. This is a tennis match, the girls are playing! You're the one to shush people. You spend all the time on your phone! - You, shut up. - Quiet, please. - Right. - Don't be rude. Come on, dad, this is boring. Can I go play with my friends? You never want to spend time with me, Javier. The same thing happens to me. They're insufferable! That's because we're not trying to find a boyfriend. What did you say? It's work! Keep your voice down. All day long on your phone! - It's for work. When you... - Ma'am. Ma'am, please. - I'm sorry. I apologize. - You're so rude. What did you say? Apologize to me! I'll slap you so hard you'll have to find your teeth...! Come on, people! Let's get it together, please! The umpire here... Sir, please, calm down and return to your seat. I won't calm down and I won't return to my seat! If someone here doesn't like tennis, then, right now, they can leave through that door! You can make a line! You all leave the court! Me! I'm not interested in tennis. I'm not interested in tennis. - No, honey. - No. No means no. No, you calm down. Focus, this game is yours. No! I don't want to focus! All day long telling me that I have to be the best, the best tennis player, that I have to be a tennis player. You're such a drag! Don't get mad at me, but get a life. Shall we? - Yes, let's go. - Let's go. Mom is here! Cuco! What happened to you? Guys! I'm home! I'm home! Is no one home? Guys, mom is here! - Mom! What are you doing here? - Hello! Hello, Mom! I thought you were coming tomorrow. - Hello! - Hello! No, not tomorrow, today. - Hi! - What a surprise! Hello! How are you? Hello. I thought you were coming tomorrow. No, today. You too? - I texted you from the airport. - I didn't get it. Hi, honey! Hello, Lolo. - For me? - Mom! Hello! Hello, hello! Did you miss me? - Yes, I missed you. - I missed you too. You look beautiful. Yes, you are so young, Mom. So, what about you? Can I go with daddy? How did you do? We didn't even realized you weren't here. Well, that's not entirely true. I think someone needs a diaper change. It's my turn. Come here, Lolo. Come, Lolito. - Can I help you? - Sure, my lovely Tatito. Look! There's poop in here! - No. - We won't do anything wrong. Do you want some candy? What did you do to them? Did you drug them? Me? Why? Because of everything, they don't look like themselves. You? Are you alright? - Yes. - Did you manage? You didn't have any trouble? You didn't want to kill them at some point? Well... And your job? Is that alright? Yes. A few minor details... It's not a big deal, I'll tell you later. Honestly, I think I enjoyed being home with the kids. Then, it's me that's the problem. No, no problem at all. We have a beautiful family, Vera. I don't know what you expected to find. You put this on your bottom, you see? - Shall I pour it like that? - Yes. Pour a little bit on your hand first. Okay, Lolito, that's it. But it's liquid. I thought it was... I know. But, first, you pour a little in your hand. Stop. Just a little bit, Bruno. And this is how it ends. I guess my point is... I know this was just a little taste. Now they're going into their teenagers years. Existential conflicts, Lara's boyfriend, picking them up at four in the morning from some party. Am I scared? Of course. But let me, at least, for a moment, pretend that I'm up to the task, that I have a perfect family and that everything will be alright. - Dad. - What? Dad is crazy. You're talking to yourself, Garbo. What's wrong? I am? No, nothing. Nothing, don't worry. I'm fine. Don't tell me "nothing", you're worrying me. I told you he was crazy. That's the last straw. What are you saying over there? I heard you! Can you cut it out? Can we have a peaceful moment? Since when do you talk to your lamp? Well... I've been doing some thinking during my trip and I made a decision. I'm going back to work. - Good! - - Good, M om! - I'm starting on Monday. - - I like it, Mom. I'd hire you as my lawyer. Will you have a good salary? Because dad got fired. - What? - Tato! And he also burned down the house. What? Vera, he's making all this up. The house was on fire? When did they fire you, Garbo? Why? Because he said "banana." No. I'll explain it all later, honey. But we'll be fine, don't worry. - Because he's crazy! - Shut up, Lolo. Wait, wait, wait. -If you're going to work... - - Right! Who'll stay with us, Mom? Well, your dad. Didn't you have a good time together? What's wrong? What did I say? Why are you leaving? Come here! Garbo! Guy! What's wrong with you? Don't leave me alone! What did I say? Tato, I brought you your drone! Very soon, Mom left home! We're all at home now!
