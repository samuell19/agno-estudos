What is it, Mishra ji? Nothing, madam. Tell me. Madam, tomorrow is Diwali. Yes, I had given you a double salary just this time. That you did. I was thinking if I could leave early today. Mishraji, I've a flight at 2 AM... No problem, madam. Actually, I was just thinking about buying new clothes for my family. Since I go home late every day. -How are you? -All good, sir. Thank you. -Mishra ji -Yes, ma'am. You can leave for now Mishra ji. I'll anyway be at the office the entire day. Go take your family shopping. Drop me to the airport in the evening. -Okay, ma'am. -And give me the car keys. In case I have to travel, I'll drive on my own. Ma'am, you must be having a duplicate key. Do I ? Oh yes, I do! -Good morning, madam. -Good morning. -Hi. Good morning. -Hi, RO. Going up today? Yes, I get lucky sometimes. Yes, I get lucky sometimes. Nonsense. Where is my treasure? Treasure? You call this treasure? It's just a cheap box of firecrackers, Satya. So lame, RO. Two floors up and six floors down. When you want a break, this is the only place in town! "Runs... " Break room! The break room is on the 5th floor. Then? The entire building has only nine floors, Satya. We are on the first floor. Two floors up and six floors down. That means the third floor, and the third floor is... Pantry! You're an Einstein, RO. Let's go. Come on. What will I do there? Please! I'll feel out of place. Please, please, please! Please! Come on. RO. -Hi. -Hi. Are you excited? It's just firecrackers, Satya. We can get those from the market too. What else can you expect to find in there? Shut up, RO. You know, I have a feeling that this is going to be a lot of fun. Why is it so dark in here? Clue. RO. "Neither up, nor down, nor in front..." "Your future is right behind you." Satya-ji. Will you marry me? No! Say yes! Yes, of course! Did you plan all of this? Yup. Woohoo! Let's go. Let your luck shine! -By the way, yesterday was-- -Crazy, right? -Yeah, crazy. -Unbelievable! -RO, can you do me a favour? -Yeah. I want to buy a ring for Vishal. -When? -Today. Today? Yeah, I'm flying to Delhi tonight. That's why. -Good morning, ma'am. -Morning. Even I am flying to Delhi tonight. -What are you saying? -Yeah. Which one? YOU JET 2 AM. Now that's called connection. Vishal and I are also on the same flight. Great! So let's buy the ring from Delhi then. You can tell me when, and I'll come over. -Sure? -Yup. That's great! Thank you, Mr. Oberoi. You make it sound like my father owns an empire of jewellery stores. RO sounds much better. Water purifier types. Well, good day! -Bye. -Bye. Oh, I almost forgot. RO... eating this is going to make me gain weight! -Fine-- -Okay, fine. -Please don't give it to me again. -Yes. It's so good! Just that-- Are you done? Now I am. Okay, bye. Good day. Hi, Anjali. Hi. Let's get to work? "Love, love... all are mad." "Love, love... the know everything" "Love, love... all are enjoying" "Osaka Muraiya oh ya ya ya yaai..." "There is intoxication in the eyes" "Osaka Muraiya oh ya ya ya yaai..." "There is intoxication in the eyes" "Osaka Muraiya..." "You have intoxication of my love" "What is in your heart" "Osaka Muraiya..." "This heart has gone mad" "This is the intoxication of this intoxicating style of yours." "Osaka Muraiya..." Bro, I needed a favour. Tell me, sir. Amid all this running around for the ring, I forgot to book my flight. And now I'm gonna miss that family lunch she had planned. You know, I should have just let her book my ticket, when she asked me. She is going to kill you! What do I do now? Tell her. Yeah? Yeah, some flowers, wine and bad news. Yeah, some flowers, wine and bad news. Yeah. She loves lilies. Just get her a big bouquet, and-- Man, you know her so well, don't you? Such a good friend you are, Rakesh. You know if I wasn't around in her life, only you could have kept Satya happy. No, sir. You are there for that. How do I arrange for the flowers now? I've got a call. I am here, sir. Thank you! Man, Rakesh, this gym was a great idea! You are a smart guy. Sir, your bottle of wine and two glasses. -You are all set. -Awesome, man. Okay, sir. I'll leave. I'll ask Mishra ji to deliver the bouquet here. I'll ask Mishra ji to deliver the bouquet here. I'll just say bye to Satya before leaving. Thanks so much! I really owe you one. I'll give you whatever you ask for. Sure? Just tell me what you want, you have my word for it. No, sir. I'll ask when the time is right. Who knows what lies in the future! Tell me now. I am-- I am really happy for you guys, sir. Thanks, man. Thanks. Happy Diwali, sir. Happy Diwali! Satya. Anthony. I was worried that you had already left. No, I was just about to leave. What's wrong? This is for you! From me. For a beautiful future! This is so sweet. Thank you. Thank you. God bless! Are you leaving tomorrow? Yes. I'm so excited. But, I'm also a bit nervous. Everything is happening so quickly. That's why... All good things. Yeah. Why haven't you left for home yet? I've a meeting with a client. I'll leave after I wrap that up. Anyway, what's the point of me going home? I don't have a family waiting for me. My family is you guys. Of course, we are. -Happy Diwali! -Happy Diwali, dear! The number you're calling is either switch off or not reachable at the moment. The number you're calling is either switch off or not reachable at the moment. Please try later. You haven't left yet? God, you scared me! Sorry. What are you doing here? I came to say bye to you. So sweet! I left one of my bags at home. I know. I'll head home and fetch it. I'll see you directly at the airport. Are you... Okay? No. Vishal's phone has been unreachable. I've been trying to reach him since a while. So, don't try. RO. He must be tied up. No, I mean, he will call you back. How do you know? I just know. As if! As if! Here. I really needed this right now. All good? RO. You're the best! I'll see you at the airport. Mishra ji. Vishal is waiting for you next to the car. Yes. Hand over the flowers to him. Shit. Shit. Shit. Where are you, Mishra ji? Mishra ji! Mishra ji! Mishra ji? The number you're calling is either switch off-- Madam. You haven't left yet? I was just about to lock the office. No, actually my car is still in the parking lot. and I haven't been able to reach my driver. Have you seen him? No, I haven't seen him, madam. We have an hour for our dinner break, So should I leave or wait? It's alright, my luggage is still in the car. So you leave, I'll manage. Okay, madam. Why are you locking the office though? Everyone has already left. It's a rule. Guard! Watchman! Anthony! "My love, the doomsday" Anthony! Anthony! "Today in your lanes, my love will go astray. Anthony!

The number you're calling is either switch off-- Where are you, Mishra ji! The number you're calling is either switch off or not reachable at the moment. Please try later. The number you're-- Please! Please! Please! -Hello, Rakesh. -Hi, Satya. Thank God! Thank God, you answered the call! Satya! RO! What are you doing? This is locked, it's not opening! Where is the button for this? Nothing is working. Come to the parking lot. -Huh? -The parking lot... -The parking lot gate... -Yeah. -Yeah. -Maybe that will open, let's try that. -Yeah, okay. -I'll see you there! -Yeah, okay. -I'll see you there! Yes, get over there. RO! How do you manage doing these things? Don't ask! -Open! -Sorry. Thank God! -What happened? -Thank God! Thank God! I got so scared! It's okay, don't worry! I am here now. Come, let's get out of here. Where is your luggage? It's in the car. The cab is 17 minutes away. Okay, he isn't going to go anywhere. You speak to him, I'll get your luggage. I'll also come. -It's alright, I'll get it. -No, I'll come too. As it is, the luggage is quite heavy. Satya, I am pretty strong too! Let's go. Why are you taking a cab though? Mishra ji's phone has been unreachable for a while. -I've been trying for so long. -And where is Vishal? Vishal's phone is still unreachable. Vishal's phone is still unreachable. You know I am really worried. I don't know where he is. -Let me try calling him. -Yes. But-- There's network only at this spot. Okay, I'll get the luggage. -Satya! -RO! -Satya! -RO! -Satya! -RO! What happened? What happened? RO... no. -No. -Mishra ji. Satya, let's go! Satya, let's go! Let's go! Satya, let's go! Let's go! This way. Satya, let's go. Mishra ji. -RO. -Wait... What... -It was opening just now... -What is happening? Hello! Anybody there? Satya! I have an idea. Let's go. Come on. Satya. The number for the security services should be somewhere here. They could help us. RO... police. Satya, let's first get out of here. We can call the police after that. -RO. -Yeah... what happened? What? What? What? -He is dead. -I know. He is dead. I know, Satya. I know, Satya. Let's... He... He would never wait in the parking lot He would always wait in the lobby, because there is network there. -I don't know what's happening? -Satya, take this. -Satya, have this candy. -I don't know what's happening. Satya, you will feel better. Satya, he thought he would wait for you there. You had told him you're ready to leave So he thought he should wait for you there. Yeah... maybe? RO, how do you know-- Come on... I got emotionally carried away. You should have just eaten the candy. I'm sorry. Satya. Satya. Satya, I didn't mean to kill him. I swear I didn't mean to kill him. You know, the biggest flaw that poor people have is loyalty. You know, the biggest flaw that poor people have is loyalty. I asked him to go celebrate Diwali with his family. Instead he wanted to wish you Happy Diwali first and then leave. So I made his Diwali happy. Satya, calm down. Look, the more you struggle, the more it will hurt. Satya, please. Just count till three, okay. Come on. One... Two... And three-- Satya, do you remember the 90's? In those days love used to be pure. There was no pressure. There was no compulsion of it being a two sided love affair. One sided love was considered cool just like my love for you. Only I can have control over it. At present, you don't know that I love you. But once you look into my eyes, you'll understand my love for you. Uff! It will be nothing less than a two sided epic love saga. But the world around us is very cruel. It scares me and so I have to protect you. I won't ever cause you any pain. I just want to protect you. Keep an eye out for you. Nobody will even be able to touch you. Except me, obviously! I will become your Batman. Yes... how cool! Why do you think Batman roams alone at night? He's also probably searching for his 'Satya' Stop! Stop! Thank you. Thank you. First day? Yeah. Don't stress. Everything will be okay. I am Satya. Satya Prabhakar. As the lift came to a halt, I felt my heart skip a beat too. You are? In such situations, I feel so frustrated with my father for not being able to give me a better name. Rakesh... Rakesh Oberoi. Rakesh... Nice name! It's been a while since I've heard such a name. Old school names have their own charm, don't they? Have a good day, Rakesh. What then? Then I fell in love with her. Thank you. Mr. Oberoi. You can join us. We don't bite. "Innocent are these looks" "Unaware of the world" "It moves around" "Have a feel of slight insensitivity" "Innocent are these looks" "Just as waves come back," "it comes back to your place" "it comes back to your place" Rakesh Oberoi? Are you following me? I... was... buying a shirt. This? Yes. "This desire that I have" "Is amazing" "It cannot be erased" "When I compete I lose to myself" "How will I win from you" "This journey is not in my hands" "Innocent are these looks" "Just as waves come back," "it comes back to your place" -Hi. -Hi. -Hi. -Hi. -Hi. -Hi. Nice haircut, RO. -Cheers to that. -Cheers. Who's given me this? RO! Thank you. I am so glad that you are my secret Santa. "Is it a coincidence, Or my destiny" "That I am present in your parties" "If this journey is my responsibility" "Then I accept it" "You are the last dream that my eyes see" "Innocent are these looks" "Unaware of the world" "Unaware of the world" "It moves around" "Feel the affect of slight insensitivity" "Innocent are these looks" "Just as waves come back" "it comes back to you" "Feel the affect of hangover" We were both so lonely, But now you have me, Satya. I would keep watching Satya day and night. But each time the lights would go out and she would go to sleep, I would get very worried for her. I would just hope that nothing would happen to her. I had to do something. "Feel the effect of hangover" How does only my internet have a problem in the entire office? Maybe your laptop misses me. Sure. Listen, I have a meeting. So please get this fixed. I'll be back. -Satya. -Yeah. Your phone. Thank you. It's okay!. It's okay! RO. Hi. There is neither any antivirus software nor any anti-hacking software in this, Satya. This is very risky. A lot of stalkers are out there these days. Who would want to stalk me? You can look into it, do whatever needs to be done. I don't understand all this at all. I don't understand all this at all. So, you can look into it. I was asking if you'll have an Americano or milk coffee. No. Whatever you feel is right. Actually, I also don't understand all of this. Okay. There are two people responsible for whatever has happened till now and will happen. First is Satya herself, The other is this city, Bombay. Sorry, Mumbai. If you want to succeed here, you have to chase money and dreams relentlessly. I was just crazy about my love for Satya. Only love. My dream is that someday, my luck will change My dream is that someday, my luck will change and you will be in my life forever. What took you so long, Satya? Come on now, let's sleep. When will I turn in, and see you again in the morning? Come on, let's sleep. Where are you going now? What... At 2 am, who... Who is he? Why are you taking him inside? Satya, why are you taking him inside? What are you doing, Satya? What is this? Hello. Sir, where were you? We waited for so long and left. Absolutely. Yes, I know we'll be charged. Doesn't matter. Money is not a problem. Happy Diwali! Sorry, Satya. I had to cancel your cab. Actually, we have different plans. Actually, we have different plans. Satya, I'll be right back. Yes, madam. I've reached. There won't be much traffic today, madam. We'll reach the airport in 20 minutes. Okay, madam. Mishra ji. You've put on so much weight, Mishra ji. Hi, Satya. Thank God! Thank God! Thank God you answered your phone. Okay, don't panic. I'll be right there! No, I am outside my house. I can't find a rickshaw. This is nothing. I am sorry, Satya. I know you must be confused. You must be upset too. But I will fix everything. Believe me. Water? Do you want water? Huh? Water? Come... May I? Here. You will feel better. Rakesh-- Rakesh, what have you done? Don't you write that - "painting the town red". That is all I'm doing. That is all I'm doing. What is wrong with you? Satya. Nothing is wrong with me. I am fine. Believe me. Don't worry about me. Please... Let me go. Please, let me go. What do you want? You. Why are you doing this? For what? Vishal only gave me this idea. You know if I wasn't around, only you could keep Satya happy. Okay, sir. Happy Diwali. Happy Diwali! Vishal. -I almost forgot. -Tell me. I love you, Satya. Rakesh, where is Vishal? Satya, I am-- Rakesh, where is Vishal? I'll show you. Wait a second. -There you go... -Please. I'll tell you, I'll tell you. Satya. This is called #Twinning Oh, sorry, sorry. Oh, sorry, sorry. Let me open this up for you. What have you done with Vishal? What have you done with Vishal, Rakesh? Why are you constantly asking about Vishal! Unbelievable, Satya. Don't you get it, Satya? What does this mean? You both had the same gag on your mouth. It's supposed to be a joke. Fun-- It's funny. It's funny. Satya. Isn't it? Sorry. I think I overreacted. There is a lot on my mind right now. That's Anjali. She looks at me whenever I call her. She looks at me whenever I call her. You also try calling her. She will look at you too. Satya, say hello. Hello, Satya. Say hello, to Anjali. Hi, Anjali. Saw that? I knew she would approve of you. Ok, I have to feed her. 2 minutes. Okay. Yup. Rakesh, please let me out of here. We can sit and talk this out. Satya, sorry. I can't untie you just yet. But I promise, I will. Both of us will go meet Vishal. He is... He is fine. He is taking a power nap. Sayta, I want you-- Can you give both of us a chance? Will you? Really, RO. Really. Really. Look at me, RO. Look at me. No... Not so easily. You have to prove it. How? This... This is the Satya I like! Free. Independent. The Satya who makes her own decisions. -Rakesh. -Yeah. I need to use the washroom. Please. Yeah, sorry, sorry. Of course. I know you must be under a lot of pressure. Satya... You should have told me before. Just a second. Do you need help? May I? Okay. Satya. Please don't try doing anything. Otherwise, I'll blow Vishal up like a firecracker. Hmmm... What hmmm? Say yes. Yes. Promise? Promise. Satya. I know you won't hit me. Better safe than sorry. Take your time. "If I tell you then don't get upset" "If I were to stay in these eyes" "If I tell you then don't get upset" "If I tell you then don't get upset" Satya. You gifted me this shirt on my birthday. It's going to come in handy today. One more thing... Your toothpaste is pathetic. We'll get a different one. After our marriage. Why are you taking so much time? Satya. Feeling better. I... I got you a gift. But it slipped my mind. My hands. Shall I unwrap it for you? Yours had gotten over, right? How do you know? Living room as well. Rakesh, since how long-- How-- Satya. How do these things matter in love? I care about you, that's all. You come home late at night. This is necessary. But I'm not like other men. I have never seen you... Rakesh-- I have never seen you naked. I swear. Even when Vishal used to come over, and both of you would be in a mood, I used to shut my eyes. Leave it. I've known this fragrance for the past two years, Satya. This fragrance is my entire world. I spray this on all my blankets and bed sheets. Can I ask you something? Satya... will you go on a date with me? Let's go. May I? My granny used to say, always put your right foot forward before starting anything new. You love going for long drive on dates, don't you? You love going for long drive on dates, don't you? Unfortunately, I only have a bike. So I borrowed a friend's car. Music? "The fire of love was burning slowly" "All the fun in the two hearts was boiling" "Let me taste the fun that's there in this." Satya. You will never forget this date. I promise. "The fire of love was burning slowly" "All the fun in the two hearts was boiling" "Let me taste the fun that's there in this" Rakesh. Rakesh, please let me go. Please let me go. Please let me go. "That's great, that's great" I have something to confess. The first time when I couldn't open the gates, I wasn't using my card. Sorry. But... I can give you my card now. After hearing me out, if you still want to leave, I won't stop you. Do you want to? Fine, go. But what do I do with Vishal? Should I keep staring into his eyes? It will look so weird. It's okay. It's okay. Don't worry. I will drop him home. You go. What happened, don't want to go? I know it's difficult, but please... Don't worry. We'll have fun. Top floor, please. There you go. Thank you. Shall we? Be comfortable. Satya, be right back. Oh no. You should have told me Satya. I would have untied you. You didn't have to do this. Move. What happened? Let me see. Show it to me. I am sorry. I won't tie it so tight next time. I got flowers for you. Mishra ji went through hell for this. They were hard to find since it was Diwali. You like lilies, don't you? Satya, you had said you like lilies. Hello, Satya. You like lilies, don't you? Yes. Thank you. Do you know why I let you untie your hands? Because someone's life is in your hands now. So they obviously can't be tied up. Let's go for a ride. Let me show you. Vishal. Vishal. -Vishal -Satya. Satya. Sit up. -Rakesh-- -Satya. Nod your head and let her know you're okay. See. He's fine, Satya. Nothing is wrong with him. He is just lying down. Do you know what he said to me behind your back? If not him, then me. Is this what you call love, Satya? Love is what I feel for you Satya. If not me, then nobody. Just don't do anything. I won't do anything. You'll do whatever needs to be done. You'll do whatever needs to be done. You had said that you will prove yourself. So prove it. You prove and he will press. Come on. Press. One... He goes to the gym every day, Satya. All that protein he takes must be put to good use. -Let him go. Talk to me. -How can I leave him, Satya? When you yourself can't leave him. Do you know why he works out? So that he can post shirtless pictures of himself on social media. He... likes pictures of other girls. It's called cheating. Did you understand that... Vishal... Come on. Press, you cheater. You love her, don't you? Rakesh, I think you are right. We should give each other a chance. We are so happy when we are together. We never feel lonely with each other. We never feel lonely with each other. Exactly, Satya. We cannot be lonely when we are together. We are talking here. Give us a moment. Show some respect for women. You continue, please. So I was saying... we don't feel lonely at all. And you have never said this, but... I knew it. Knew what? I... I knew that-- Yes. You love me. Yeah, and... That you love me a lot. That's the problem, Satya. I love you a lot. I love you a lot. That's the problem, Satya. You love him. You love him. This man. He's going to press now. -Come on, press. -You are not listening to me. Satya, I am listening to you. Come on, press. -Yeah... -We... we won't tell anyone about Mishra ji. To hell with Mishra ji, Satya. We are talking about the two of us right now. You have already made a mistake, Rakesh. Don't make another one. Please. What if something happens to you, Rakesh? Then what will happen to me? What am I doing? What am I doing? Satya, you are right. If I am gone, then what about you? Who will look after you? We cannot make a new beginning with a crime. I will tell the police everything. Yeah... I'll go to jail. So what? You will wait for me outside. You'll wait for me, won't you? I love you. You think I- Just because I love you, you can't take advantage of me. -I am not taking advantage of you. -Just because I am emotional. Not anymore, RO. -Come on, press. -RO. I am not lying. Come on. You love her, don't you? Show how much you love her. Come on. And you care for him? Why? Come on, press. Can't do it? I know you can't. You don't even love her. Why do you keep chasing her? Hold it. He is disturbing us. Now, look at me. I love you too. What did you say? Satya, say that again. Please. Say it again... You. You keep scaring her. You ruined our moment. Look, you scared her. Please open... Satya, I know you are scared, but... Okay, I am sorry. Satya... Listen, did you see Satya? Come on, tell me. What kind of a watchman are you? Come on... Come on... I forgot about this. "Jumma. Jumma. Jumma. Jumma." "Jumma. Jumma. Jumma. Jumma." "Jumma." "My sweetheart." "Come out now... " "It's Friday... " "You had made a promise for today... Look, I've come--" You are so smart, Satya. This is why I love you so much. Yes, you are. Now let's see where you are. Stay there. I'm coming. Hi. Sorry. Sorry. Vishal scared you, didn't he? Can we talk? Let's start from the beginning. I said I love you. What did you say then? Please say it again. I know you are shocked. You must have gotten scared too because of how he was screaming. It's all my fault. I should have told you earlier. I know you love me too. I should have told you earlier. You know what, Rakesh. I lied. I thought if I said I love you, you will let Vishal go. I thought that you needed help. Maybe we could sit and talk. But you are crazy. You are sick. Do you still believe, that after everything that has happened, I will love you? I'll never love you. Never. You said you loved me, Satya. Didn't you? Is this some kind of a joke? You cannot take it back. It's love, Satya. Stop calling me crazy. Do I look sick to you? Am I mad? What is this, Satya? How did you get hurt? How did you get hurt? Sorry. Sorry. It... got a little intense. It's the situation. I can never hurt you. Come, let's sing a song. It's said that singing reduces stress. You love music. I love music. Duet? Let's sing a duet, come on. "You're in front of me" "I'm in front of you" "Should I look at you or make love to you" "How did this happen" "How did this happen" "That you became mine" "How can I trust that" "I'm broken and crushed" "I'm compelled due to your stubbornness" "I'm broken and crushed" "I'm compelled due to your stubbornness" "Your magic has worked, o magician" "I'm broken and crushed" Give your granny my regards. Satya. Satya. Satya. Satya-- Shit! Shit! Satya. Satya. Satya. Everyone's on their way to Delhi. We are still here. Come Satya, let us also go to Delhi. We'll feel better once we go there. Satya. Satya. "Bloodshot eyes." "Painful memories." "Painful memories." "Fear couldn't be alleviated." You're sure, right? I'll bring my mom-dad to your house on Tuesday. Think about it until then. "Decision is confirmed." I love you. "Your head will definitely bow this time." "Burning my body... freedom." "Breaking your illusion... freedom." "Pulling the arrow." "I destroyed your prison." "Freedom. Freedom." "Freedom. Freedom." "Freedom. Freedom." Satya, what... Satya, wait... Satya. Satya, calm down. Satya, calm down. Satya, what are you-- Satya. Satya. "My heart blooms as you meet me" Satya, why are you so mad at me? "What else do I need to live?" Satya. I know it's hard to forget your ex. Even I had an ex. Her name was Anjali. I brought this goldfish in her memory. You know what, We'll get a goldfish in Vishal's memory too. Happy? Come on. Let's go. "What else do I need to live?" "What else do I need to live?" Satya. Satya. Let's sit and talk-- Satya. Satya. Enough. Enough. Enough. Enough. What are you doing? You're hurt, right? Our children will be so thrilled, when they find out, how their mom and dad fought on their first date. Come on, let's go to the hospital together. What? Rakesh. Rakesh. Yes, Satya. Listen... Tell me. What happened? Rakesh... What happened? Say bye to Anjali. Satya... Want to know a fun fact about goldfish, Satya? She knows where she stands. She is happy in her own fish bowl. Anjali, my ex in Delhi, Anjali, my ex in Delhi, had forgotten her place. That's why she is called Anjali. Why did you come into my life? Say sorry. Say sorry. Satya. Sorry. I thought you were my friend, Rakesh. What do you think, that you are a man? I should also fall in love with you just because you love me? You know what? You are not a man, Rakesh. You are not a man. Rot in that box, until the police don't arrive. I feel like killing you with my own hands, but then there will be no difference left between us. Do you think these dialogues you're saying will make me forget everything? My love isn't so weak. My love isn't so weak. I will come to seek my mother-in-law's blessings. Whether I get the bride or not. Pushpanjali Prabhakar, Bungalow no. 21. Civil Line! My in-law's home.
