BACK DOOR It was you! ATHENS, 1966 Yannis, what is this? You and your bloody degrees Jason. Athens is hot and sunny... who needs plate-glass windows? - Two floors meet here. - Two? Only two? We're going for heighy here, Jason. We didn't reinforce next door for the fun of it. Well done, guys. That's what I like to see. Dimitris... The overnight work was perfect. Dimitris, look! What's going on, Dimitris? Got a dose of spring fever, have we? That's cement, dummy! Wet it and it gets harder than your dick. - Mr. Kemeras. - What? They are back again... the vultures. Hold this. Why are you here again? Go no farther, Mr. Kemeras. Well? The permit says six floors, you're at eight already. You should be pleased. Laws must be upheld. The present government... For how long? My building is forever. Can your tiny brain grasp that? - You're out of order. - An order to cease and desist. You have to stop. This is "Ciel" in tropical wood. Satin lining or lightly quilted. Silver-plated handles. This is a Light-colored wood. Again, with satin. But for Mr. Kemeras, I think the most... Listen to me... Dimitris, you have to be strong now. We must help your mom. Yannis Kemeras envisaged an Athens... which would reach the heavens. Just like stuttgard. The higher the buildings rose, the happier he was... just like a child. That's how we will remember you, friend Yannis... after your most worthy life. - Get fucked, Snitch. - I'll fix you. My condolences, Mrs. Vretsanou. When your father died, I wanted to go with him. But he asked me to stay behind to take care of you. - Ever the gentleman. - How you've grown, Dimitris. Yannis hasn't talked to you yet because he's on his way here. - Perhaps tonight. - Give it a rest, mom. We have Dimitris to look after. Who? This person here. He'll be our man, now. I'm going inside for a while. Don't leave your mother alone. Not today, Dimitris. And now... the problems begin. You're still young Fotini. You must look after yourself. You need to be strong. Vaso, I want one of those pills, too. I can't sleep. - Can you nick some? - Stop, Gina. I do not all the time. Look. My mistress's underwear. I put it back and get more. Are your tits the same size as your mistress's? What are you doing over there? I'm doing fine. Were you eavesdropping? Dear boy, my condolences. All of us maids were really sorry. What are you laughing at? You want to go back to the village? Buzz of, or you'll miss it. What are you lot looking at? - You're a hit, man! - Don't talk crap, man. Elenitsa, how do you do? Psimikakis. I know that at times like this you only see the light... but you must try to see the darkness too. Good one Elenitsa. Think it up yourself? Wake up! While others horse around, we use our hands and brains. Don't fall into the hole. You have to be strong. That's what dads like. They always piss off. Than was in. Listen, check this out. Come on, give it your best shot. - What did that scumbag want? - Nothing. What's this? What? No photos? Atomic bomb? Don't be a sucker, Kemeras. My dad told me about it. It's propaganda. Dimitris, like to see the fleet with me? - We'll board the enterprise. - He has better things to do. Ilias. At your command, admiral... of the coast guard. So... here's to our Yannis. So many responsibilities, I don't know what to do. He was in over his head with the new building. Want to go next door and play cards, Dimitris? I believe both the National Bank and the Ionian had him covered. I know what I'm saying. He was obsessed. Don't worry, he provided for you. You won't starve. Listen... I don't need any surprises. I'm here for you, you know that. As for the building... My dad's building has be completed. Mr. Dedes, tell us about the trial. About your great triumph. Aren't the centrist papers engaging in hyperbole? Not at all. The entire casa was a lebellous setup by the master of the game. - But... weren't they communists? - Yes, but they were innocent. All the prosecution's evidence was false. Yet another frame-up by the palace. How could communist be innocent? Gina! I need you in here. What are you doing here? - This is only for the maids. - I needed some air. We have guest. You know how it is. Listen... just watch yourself up here. She gave him land for units... but he married the other woman and left her with the units. Excuse me a second, Zeta. Excuse me. Not going to sleep in my room? Mom, let's not have guest every day. It's not a special occasion. No, darling. They come to show they're thinking of us. Dad didn't like visitors. - You're tired, aren't you? - I am, but I'll get over it. I'll draw strength from you. Run! - Missed it, too, you dope? - Yup. Waited for you, didn't I? We're in for it now. Spinios will give us an earful. Hey, Michalis, can you drive us to school? Missed it again, you little pricks? Come on, I'll take you in my babe. Come here. "The king rejected George Papandreou?s request..." "to form a government." "in other news..." Your father paid for these, so I'm giving them to you. Hide them. Keep them hidden. Leave the kid alone, mafioso! "The huge protest march..." Move it, unless you want to remain dunces. "51 students were arrested." "General De Gaulle has decided..." "to place US bases in France under his command." "And is now threatening to withdraw from NATO." I've never seen these before. If I show up with yank smokes, my group will think I've defected. What group? On saturday, well go to a tavern... for a bit of action. Hanging out with those sissies from school isn't good. You go there, too. My mother sacrificed everything... so I can be at that shitty school with "Gentlemen". I can't wait to finish! My mom's freaking out. I'm her crutch. Good man. Let everyone whine, but you stay strong. Give me one... I've got to split. Don't be stingy. Take it easy and hold out for saturday. Vaso, are you and Michalis going to marry? What are you talking about? What would we live on? What about your afternoon nap? It's 03:30. - I'm coming. - Come on. Spend less, miss. We must economize. Yes, madam. Oh, and use the good dinner set tonight. Thank you, my dear. Well? There's a Swiss account... and one in Paris from his Africa days. - It needs your signature. - Is it much? I'll give you names, numbers, directions... How can I manage alone? Can't you come with me? - Would my signature do? - When you're 21, young man. So change that. What sort of lawyer are you? They let me into adults only movies. Dimitris! I just want to help. I just don't want you to be rude, that?s all. And I don't like you acting silly in front of strangers. I don't mind if we're alone. I must say, Yannis's dress sense was not the best. Give it a rest, mom! - Let's give some to Michalis. - Are you crazy? These clothes to Michalis? Why not? Dad liked Michalis. He'd have liked him to have them, now that he's... dead. Your father had a strong sense of family. I'll keep them for you. End of story. Dad would have wanted it. I know it. See how it suits him? In two years it will fit like a glove. Did he stand you up? Here he comes. How are the caf? revolutionaries? Mind your mouth, disciple. Let me showed you what is scored the other day. What went down man? Did all hell break loose? Hei, hide that! Give it back before they lock us up. We're out of here. Michalis, man! - Antonis! - Theodoros. - They let you out? - Just for the day. - No more money to the royals! - Educate us for our toils. I'm going for some smokes... I'll be back. Cheers! Here's to us, man. Slow down! - Everything ok? - Yes. - Like being with us? - Yes. You do as you please. Not quite, buddy. We do thing we believe in. Lay off, Manolis. He's about to start preaching! Don't you believe in what you believe in, Xenia? - What's wrong with doing both? - That's deep. - Learned the poem? - Almost, only 13 pages to go. They're both in the Lambrakis youth movement. Keep it quiet! - Who brought you? - Antonis. Cheers! Mom and I live alone, and money's tight. I worked on a building site for a while, but they shut it down. Why did they shut it down? - The building was too tall. - And the workers? How did your father die? My father... was fighting in the civil war. As a volunteer... and he caught a bullet in the head. Holy mother! - What's wrong with him? - He drank too much. Vaso, what's going on here? Who are you? Antonis. - Don't you have a surname? - I'm Dimitris classmate. As if I'd believe that! I mean, same school. I'm in fifth form. What are you doing with my boy? - We went to a... - To a what? E-man-ci-pa-tion! What did you do to him? Nothing. Why freak out at words over three syllables? Kindly go. Get out. I'm trying to hold a family together here. Look, we went to a tavern, he got drunk, I brought him home. That's all. "DEDES: Solicitor to the persecuted." - How do you know him? - Apostolas is our lawyer. Really? What's he like? I don't know. He's ok, I guess. It say's they want him for mayor of Athens. - Did you know that? - Hey, kid! This is for you. He's investing now to double his returns later on. Dimitris... What's this? What's this revolting stuff? Who gave it to you? - It was that Antonis. - Antonis is my friend. Dimitris, of course you're curious but these things are bad for you. In time you'll find a girl your own age... What do you mean? Bad how? They're bad for your health and for your eyesight... I can't explain it to you. There are things you have to experience. If my eye start hurting, I'll stop reading it. I want you to throw it away. How can I go to Paris if I can't count on you? What's going on? Going out, are we? Yes, and I'm running late. Laura's waiting. I expect you to get rid of it. OK. It's a surprise. Get out, you. Keep moving. Eyes front. Keep looking ahead. What are you doing, Kaladitis? Are you crazy? So book me. Move over, you. For once I use bus and it becomes an issue? Got anything to say. Kemeras? - Do you know Xenia well? - Why? - How old is she? - 16, but she's liberated. Last year, she was seeing one of the ancients of the group. - How ancient? - 25. Don't sweat it. The theory of extremes applies here. If she likes much older men... she'll like them much younger, too. - Have you done it with Mary? - Huh? No, not with Mary. Now there's a chick for you. - Ever been to a hooker? - Don't even think about it. Only cowards use hookers. I want you to be a lady-killer. Only fuck women you like, not what's easy. Clear? - Who's going to fuck? - What's this? An amoeba? Score some clean clothes, man. You stink! That hurt. He sent my eyes to the back of my head. - I think he likes you. - Yeah? What were you saying? - Nothing much. - I heard: it was about chicks. I wanted advice, I really need to fuck. My cousin Yorgos knows the best brothel. Antonis says wankers use them. Get real, man, who'd do us? I tell you, my cousin knows these things. Come on, let's go. You keep saying you need me, but you keep going away. I have to. Dad's affairs can't wait. I consider you a man, so you can stay with Vaso... and you can look after your grandma as well. - It's a bit short, isn't it? - You think? Look at what he'd make me film. Monstrosities! Communists didn't do the greatest harm to this nation, building contractors did! - All in the name of modernism. - You're right, they're hideous. He was my brother. I loved him, but the truth must out. However, I did find something nice. That's me! The birth of Venus. There's dad! What happens next? There. Uncle Ilias... did dad love mom? Dimitris, married couples are a strange breed. Ilias! My brother loved concrete, and you stuck like concrete. Who's there? It's me. What's up, Dimitris? Are you lost? Vaso's gone out and... So she should. She's under your thumb. Not mine. Mom's. I know. Come in. Sit down. What's bugging you? - Have you got a girlfriend? - Yes. So how are things with her? She's old and I need to do more homework. Nonsense! Strike while the iron's hot. Trust me on this. I want to learn. You want me to teach you the tricks? Fondled and kissed for a long time. Don't just stick it in. Kiss them all over, but don't stick it in. She'll want you like crazy. Shouldn't I put it in even a little? Yes, sure you should... but not rush. - Hey, kid... - But... Behave. Let me... just a little bit. I said I'd give you some tips... but that doesn't include a fuck. Run along to mommy, sonny. At this time of night! Is this it, dummy? You go first. I look like my cousin and they might recognize me. You should be working, not cooking, bitch! Be grateful I cook, dickhead! - What are you cooking? - Stuffed vegetables. I told you not to stuff them with mince, damn you! Don't you ever listen? Don't tell me how to cook! Then you eat it! I'll eat out! Screw you, you dirty bitch! What are you doing here? What an asshole. Have a seat. Eat this. It's tasty. Don't you like it? That's a good boy. Have some more. I hope you choke on your meal, asshole! You're a good boy, aren't you? Touch my tit to get a hard-on. Stroke it. Stroke. Come on. Come on, sweetie. Good, good... Congratulations. Off you go. Want to finish off the capsicum, too? Shut up, cunts! No one's leaving here. Ever! - Mom? - Darling. - What happened to you? - It's nothing. I'll explain. How was Paris without us? Forget that! Tell us, did it hurt? A bit. The doctor was very good. In Athens, you're a close second to the lanara woman. Don't rub it in, Laura! Oh, Laura. Did you get my record player? Ah, yes... I forgot all about it, darling. Your mom's looking great. Yeah. I almost didn't recognize her! She looks like her dad did when he got back from the front. Can put a record on? - Learn to knock, Vaso. - What are you doing? - Whatever I please. - Fresh and clean. Get a grip. What's got into you? - Set me up with Xenia. - Is the giant stirring? Out of the question! Not your babe, just the keys to the Pontiac. Even more out of the question. I'll tell mom you slept over two nights running. Was this your idea? Enemy tactics, now? It's in a good cause, comrade, and I'm an ace driver. So... Let's see it. It's so lovely. French doctor equals a french nose. What's with you? Don't you like it? Michalis is such an asshole. We're going to look like jerks. Pull over. I don't want to go. I feel lousy. You're just nervous. Don't worry about a thing. - Love the wheels, Antonis. - Shut up, at least it's a car. I've got a surprise for you, girls. What's the nutcase up to now? This is more than a date... We're advancing the struggle. Xenia... Your job is to recruit our friend here. He's worthy and brave. He's a sweetheart. What's the matter? Let's get out of here. Now, Mary! Now! What did you do, you idiot? I've got something... down there. You're a dickhead. You had to go to a hooker? - You couldn't wait. - I wanted to be ready. Ready? You'll never get another fuck as long as you live! - Shouldn't a doctor see me? - Yes, let's tell your mom. - Are you nuts? - Any other males in the family? - Dimitris! - Uncle, I need to talk with you. What's up? Is something wrong? This is my friend Antonis. Hi, Antonis. Come on in. Have a seat. Ummm... We've got a problem. This is Mimis, guys. My nephew Dimitris, and his friend Antonis. Hi. I'm listening. Never mind, we'll discuss it some other time. Out with it, Dimitris. What are you afraid of? I see. - It's big. - And red. I'll give you some ointment. Get the Fenergan, Mimis. If it doesn't get better, we'll see a doctor. So, here we have... 52, 46, 58... The speakers are loud and the ceremony begins. Next! You! 46. 54. 58. 36. 28. Suckhead! I told you so. I knew a thing or two, dickhead. Shut up or I'll bash you. You wanted to act grown-up. Syphilis kills! Ask your buddy Antonis! Shit. Vaso. - Aren't you going to dress up? - Yes. The swelling's gone right down. I thought it was imperative to accept the prime minister's offer... and announce my candidacy. I shall seek the democratic vote... with the promise that at the end of the four-year term... Athens will be unrecognizable. It will be a new Athens. As mayor of all Athenians... I promise to clean up our city. It will be renovated, more beautiful and taller. He could even make a speech in his closet... About dogs and cats or rats and bats. And one more thing: one more thing. There was a great man... a visionary... who was instrumental in forming my present-day philosophy... for our new Athens... Yannis Kemeras, to whom I owe a lot. Dimitris... listen to me, son... sadly, your poor father won't be here to have the joy of being with us... at the opening of his new building. His dream will come true. The building will be completed. My electoral promise is that when I'm elected... it will become the new town hall of the new Athens. Are you pleased, son? I've got syphilis! It's just an infection that coincided with being run-down. Nothing to worry about. I'll write prescription for antibiotics for 20 days. You may get dressed. And look after your willy, it's your most valuable asset. Well? Did he cut it off? - Go and get him. - Yes, sir. - Apostolos? - Everything's fine. A thousand thanks. I don't know what I'd do without you. I didn't do anything special after all, these are men's problems. Citizens of Athens deserve to live in a functional city... A contemporary city... in a new Athens. "APOSTOLOS DEDES" "for a new Athens" Vaso! Bring me my suit, please. Come back here. Are you going out like that? It's better than walking around like him. Like who? You're screwed, Kemeras. Look, it's the faggots. You just can't stay away from school, can you? What's your beef, meatball? I'll show you who's a meatball! Why don't you poofters take a hike? Six of you to take on two fairies? Hey, come back here... Well done, guys. You're worthy and brave. It's Xenia. - What happened? - Nothing. - What nothing? - Nothing. Dimitris. Dimitris. Dimitris, consider my feelings, too. I'm not made of steel. If you've got a problem, let's discuss it. - Can't you go to his place? - Apostolos and I are married. - Did you ask me? - I did, and you agreed. It must have slipped my mind. You're a big boy now and you must be fair. Your mother's suffered a lot. Don't make her feel bad. We can talk things over if you feel the need to... man-to-man. Whenever you have a problem or a need... come to me. Don't walk around with your pants off... and when you screw, do it quietly. Agreed. Anything else. There's the new Athens, but where to now? Must you oppose everything Ilias? I'm happy your brother's vision is materializing. - Really? - But why a town hall? It would be a fine place to live. Man has been to the moon... or almost... and you still expect solutions through politics? First, we must be true to ourselves. Cut the hippy crap. Ourselves? Once Papandreou?s in, the king will stage a coup. Commies will get first, so no elections ever. You see commies everywhere. Get stuffed. What does your stepfather say? Come on, tell us! Who knows? He's busy romancing mom. And the Kennedy visit? Kennedy came to get at Onassis because of Jackie! - Greece means shit to him. - What's Jackie done to you? Everyone's on edge, but things are looking up, right? Our time has come. Down with the oldies! What's up? At worst you'll never get a fuck again. Quit it. Athens is small. Look further afield. Even Psimikakis got a chick! Suddenly you're a man, and they're confused. Let's try a change of scene. Get lost, you scumbag. With fast talk and sex, we will change the cosmos. I know! Have a party and invite chicks. Yeah, dickhead, in that big old house while the oldies are away. - We'll have a blast. - I'm in! This is where it's at, my brave friend. Hey, how's it going? - Fine, and you? - Cool. - Don't do it, they're bums. - Move aside, woman. - Here we go again. - Shut up, you bums! Quiet! - You're no Greeks, you're scum. - Come inside, Yorgos! Your days are counted, fossil. Hey, Mangy, here. Come on, mongrel. Come here, boy... Come on, Mangy! You're crazy? Come on, man. The Greek is ready to go. Sure you can't come? We'll have fun. I have to study. I left money in the dresser in case you need anything. Look after granny. Bye, big guy. Get the money from the dresser and take Vaso out... until morning. Didn't you invite any of our classmates, Kemeras? - Aren't there a few extras? - Yeah, man, cool. You remember Mary? How low can one go? - Is this your house? - Not good enough for you? - I see you've gone downhill, too. - Get with the times, girl. Don't let her get to you. - Shall I change the music? - No, it's nice. I'm flying man. LSD. No! I'm flying on acid. What are you doing? Are you crazy? - Come on, guys. - Relax, there's heaps here. What happened, man? What a clown! Oh, Lord! Why on earth did we go out? What are we going to do? Quit your whining and brig that wire. - Get a move on, Gina. - Yes, boss. Can I help out, Michalis? I'm pretty handy... See to the kid. The kid really screwed up. I'm sorry, Dimitris. I didn't know those guys. I bet. You use them and then you kiss them off. Watch your mouth, kid. Without me, you'd still be playing marbles. And you'd be asking everyone for handouts, not just me. Fuck you, twerp. Have you no respect? Not even for family property? Making a brothel of the house! Respect us or go live with the bums! Why do you upset your mom, Dimitris? - Do you do it on purpose? - Is that all you have do say? You're grounded for a week. You force me to do this. You know I'm a firm believer in personal freedom... but sometimes one need to be deprived of it to appreciate it. Fuck you. What did you say? Fine... I'll stay in... but you two get out. "Don't let it get you down. Psimikakis is still around." What are you doing, Ilias? He's being punished. Tell him to punish his own kid. We have family matters to discuss. We wont be long. - Bye, Vaso. - Bye, sir. Guess what I found, Hang on, it gets better. I try to make your life better, and you wreck everything. What are you trying to prove? That you're a rebel? You saw what they're like. They stole all our silver. Since dad died, all you care about is your damn silver. You've become insensitive, Dimitris. I saw him. Who did you see? Dad. I'd forgotten him. I'll be back in an hour. - It's the communists. - Communists have a tanks? They'll slit our throats again. What's going to happen, madam? What's going on? It's a coup. Let's not worry prematurely. With tanks at the door? Those commun... use the coat hanger... go get 'em! It's not the communist. Quite the opposite. We have to stay calm. "Royal decree: "In accordance with article 91 of the constitution..." "and pursuant to a government initiative..." "the following articles are forthwith suspended:" "5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 18," - What are you doing? - Shaving to go to the office. Are you mad? What if they arrest you? I won't be shut up in my home. I'll wait for them in my office. I'm going to school. - You're not leaving! - Cool it, mom. "By order of Costantine, king of the Hellenes." Cool, no school today, Kemeras. - What's going on? - Confiscation. - Confiscating what? - Hand over that paper! Stab with it! Good. Kill, kill! Kill! Now! Kill him! Yes! Kill him! Now! Kill him! Yes! Kill him! Now! Raise it, slow and steady. Look at those assholes. Take it easy, man. - Michalis, have you seen Antonis? - No, he's disappeared. Watch them all evaporate now. They're all talk. I notice Dedes wasn't busted. How come? "POLICE HEADQUARTERS" "The friend of the masses." - By myself! - Let's go, you! Get a move on. - Password? - Dimitris. Watchword? Fine, go through... What's up, kid? Were you worried about me? Relax, they're too busy chasing lefties... to worry about dirtbags. I know. They grabbed Michalis and beat him up. Bullshit, man. When? I spit on you, vermin! Round up those bums. Take this now. Let go of me. Where's my brave young man? Where are you, my fine friend? Scum! Let go of him! He's mayor Dedes's son! - I'm not his son. - Who are you? My name's Kemeras. My mother is married to Mr. Dedes. Beat it, twerp. Beat it. Watch it, kid Don't kill yourself. I can't do that. Especially now. They'll beat him to a pulp. They'll torture him. I like you buddy but he asked for it. I want us to be pals... but don't run to me with every screwup. What about Michalis? Did he ask for it, too? Go back inside, Vaso. They've asked Apostolos to be in the government. Put yourself in his place. Tomorrow they're going to make it official. Later, he'll sort out your friend. It'll be too late. Dimitris, you must be more understanding. Your father would have kept building. Men always look ahead. Things will work out. Aren't you ashamed, letting non-coms in here? I've told you how it is. In my day, we only let in admirals and higher. If you don't mind, just stay out of it. Will you wear something nice? Things will get better, you'll see. We'll intervene and get Michalis back. Vaso? What did you do with my bathrobe? - Good evening. - Hello and welcome. - Hello, mayor. - Welcome. - My dear sir. - How are you? I'm fine, and you? Come on through. - How are you? - Fine. Good to see you. Hello, sonny. Come in. Through here. - The soup turned out well. - The ladle, Gina. I'm almost done with the salad. Right, let's go. Who's got syphilis? What? Shut up. Listen! Listen to the wind rising from the depths of the ages. Sparta beckons us. Hellenic virtue has always been martial. Moving with order! Hurry, hurry! Hold those torches up. Don't burn yourselves. More your butts! Mind the tents! Yannis fix yourself up. You too, Lassie. Up! Up! Heads up high! Where are you going? Get a move on. Hurry, hurry! Get your helmets on, you lot. Keep moving, keep moving! "It was we who invented democracy." "It is we who decided to abolish it..." "for it has degenerated into anarchy..." Spears up straight! Up straight! Hurry! Keep moving! Keep moving! Spears up straight. - Put your helmet on, kid. - Helmet on! "With our martial ethos..." "and the recent revolution by our armed forces..." "we have crushed anarchy and communism." "With our martial ethos..." "our soldierly virtue is the foundation..." "of our nation's existence and 3000 year history." "The inspiration behind Thermopylae..." "Marathon, Navarino, Vitsi, and Grammos. "And it has led the way..." "for a Greece of Christian Greeks: patriotic, moral and pure." During the dictatorship, "Celebration" were held... to extol the "Soldierly virtue the Hellenes". They were an ideological showcase for the regime. Participation was compulsory.
