Mike and I... What we had was like fireworks. A burst of lights and energy. We lived in moments. No limits. Whatever came next did not matter to us. It was loud, colorful, and beautiful. I can't let... But just like fireworks, after the spectacle... it's gone. - Later, OK? - Yes, anything for you, baby. Morning, Margie. Good morning, Marge! Take care. What's the matter, Marge? Are you like this even now? Why don't you just give it a chance? He paid a lot for that trip. That's right, this is my treat and I paid already! Just come with us. I can't, I'm busy. I have something else to do. You're always busy. Such a killjoy! Good morning! Miss Marge, Miss Jaja, Sir Aldred! Correction! I am the "miss," and she is the "sir." Don't worry about it, OK? - Just call me "Jaja." - OK! Careful! She has a boyfriend waiting outside. She's well-guarded. - Keep it like this. - Thank you. That's for blood extraction. For urinalysis, - let the patient label their own specimen. - OK, noted. - OK? - Noted! You can call the next patient. Yes, Miss Marge. Valerio, Jacqueline! - Baby! - Miss, excuse me! - Valerio, Jacqueline! - Miss! - Vale... - We have waited hours! Sorry, ma'am! Follow me. - Let's go, son. - Go, baby! Have a seat, ma'am. Son, wait for a while. - Let's eat. - OK. - Ouch! It hurts! - Sorry, ma'am! Excuse me! I'm sorry, let me handle this. I'm just here to get my son's X-ray result. I don't know why she's taking my blood pressure! I'm really sorry, Ms. Marge. It's really hard to concentrate when... It's hard to concentrate if you are flirting with your boyfriend while you are at work! If you don't tell him to go home, I will file a complaint against you. You may have a boyfriend, but you may lose your job. Marge, enough of that. We have a long queue. - Whose file is this? - I'll check the results at the other lab. - You go ahead, OK? - OK. Hi! You're here for your medical certificate, yeah? - Yes. - What's your name? Paulo John Solis. I need my medical certificate for my job. Paulo John Solis, I'll take care of that, OK? Stay there. - Thank you! - I'll take care of it. Marge. - I'm working. - Wait, wait! Marge! Wait a minute! Talk to me, please? - No! Not now, I'm busy! - Marge! How much for a urine test? - 500. - 500? - Drug test for employment? - OK, yes! Will you fill this up, please. Let me guess. She's your ex? - That's a tough one. - Paulo John Solis? Follow me for the urine exam. Bro, miss, is it OK if I go first? We just need to talk? Actually, sir, I can take you both in. - What's your name, sir? - Michael Sy Palma. - OK. Let's go. - Thanks. - Thank you! - No problem. - Come in. - Marge! Why did you let them both in? I thought it would save time, Miss Margie. - The queue is getting longer. - OK. Go ahead, you can do it. - Two minutes! - Mr. Paulo Solis! - Marge, please! - Mr. Palma. Here. Miss, excuse me. Mr. Solis, Mr. Palma. Over there. Make sure you fill them up with the midstream urine. - Here? - There. - Miss, it's me who is Paulo Solis. - Yes. Don't close the door... Your boyfriend is here again. - He's there? Let him in. - Fine, at your own risk! - Miss, I'm Paulo Solis. - OK. - Baby. - Baby! I brought you food! - I'll just place it here, OK? - OK! - Thank you! - Miss. Thank you, sir. - I'll go ahead, OK? - Already? - What time should I pick you up? - Around five. OK! Don't leave until I come back. - I'll wait for you. - Promise you'll wait for me. I'll stay here. Baby... Paulo Solis. Thank you. Before I leave where's my kiss? Just leave. Just one, here. OK, please leave. - Love you. - Please, leave. Bye. Shit. Aileen, do you have a message for your friend? He might be listening now. I love you so much, Alex... Even if you only see me as a friend. I'd rather we stay like this than live without you. That's a brave one from our caller! Alex, Aileen loves you. Whatever happens, I hope you realize how hard this is for her. Can you please play the song "Maibalik"? This song is for you, Alex. Maybe not now, but I hope you and I will have a chance in the future. Well, your request is our command. This is for you, Alex! "Maibalik" by JBK. ♪ From the corner ♪ ♪ Of your eyes ♪ ♪ There are tears of pain ♪ ♪ That I caused ♪ Oh my God. ♪ I didn't mean ♪ ♪ For our worlds to falter ♪ ♪ I'll bring to you ♪ ♪ Your embrace and kiss I long for ♪ ♪ And now I regret ♪ Hi! Hey! I miss you. - Darn it! - Marge! - Excuse me, I'll throw this. - Marge, can we talk? - About what? - About a lot of things. About nonsense things! Don't you dare follow me! Stupid garbage! Crap! - OK... - What? Let's talk properly. Come on! I did everything, I even had a urine test back there! So, now you'll find out that I use marijuana. It's for medical purposes, so don't report me. What did you say? Ah... That I do cannabis. For medical purposes, OK? It's legal in California. So... - I don't care! - Marge! Marge. Oh, dear. I have a bad feeling about this, friends! I knew it. Seems like there really was a switch! Look! It was Pearl who labeled the specimens! And she knows that is not allowed! Good that I reported last night that Mr. Handsome tested positive. That poor guy. He's so adorable! I can't believe he was using marijuana. He's going to Dubai, right? Wow! You sure know a lot about him. Marge! I already sent the results to the employers. What's going to happen now? Sir, can you play it one more time? Last one, please! How did you graduate your course if you can't even do a simple urine sample collection? You already know that patients should label their own cups! I'm so sorry, ma'am! Ma'am, as Pearl's immediate head, I claim full responsibility for the unfortunate... "Unfortunate mistake"? Is that all it is to you, Margie? The company already declined Mr. Solis' employment. Both of you are liable for this! We may be sued! Social media persecution! Backing out of our clients! All of that, because you are incompetent, Irresponsible, and incapable! You better fix this. Or else... Both of you will be looking for new jobs by the end of this month. Am I getting myself clear? - Now what? Still unattended? - Yes. - Is there an emergency number? - None! - Let's just go to his place. - What's his address? Ilocos. "Ilocos"? Is there a Manila address? Or anywhere nearby? None! Ms. Margie, I'm really, really sorry! Let's just move on, OK? Next step? Solve the problem. Your apologies won't do anything. - Ma'am, there's no more. - Really? For any flight today? There's really no more available flights to Ilocos today. - How about other airlines? - They're all fully booked. - OK, thank you! - OK, ma'am. Hey! Hey! What is your problem? You keep popping up everywhere! Sorry! Sorry for what happened. How many times do you have to say sorry? Actually, twice, just from your last sentence. I think the other nurse messed up because of me. What? How did you know that? Uh... uh... I assumed. I asked the other guy if I could go before him. But the nurse agreed to take us both in. Did the test results get mixed up? So, it was all your fault. But as usual, you're dragging others down! Now I'm the one cleaning up the mess! Marge! Wait! Marge! What? Let me help you fix this. Please, it was my fault anyway. And besides, I know my way around Ilocos. My grandmother lived there, remember? And since I'm involved, I can explain to the guy what happened. How do you know about Ilocos? How did you know he lived there? We had a chat yesterday. Please? Let me help you. Uh... Marge, I'd like to say something. Something important. Not now, please. Can't you see I have a huge problem? My job is at stake. My entire career is at the risk of falling apart... again! And you want to add more to the problem? OK, sorry. Sorry, that was insensitive. I'm just not used to this kind of silence. Can you please say something? Anything. How is your love life? Are you seeing anyone? Tell me! Sorry, just trying to make small talk. Do you know that I'm worrying about where to get another job? What about this car? I'm still paying for this! So, if all you want is to make small talk, please spare me! Let's take a seat. - May I take your order? - Sizzling pork. - Is that enough for two? - Yes, ma'am. Two cups of rice and two sodas. How about you? That's all. I want stir fried vegetables. I'm so hungry. - I'll have two cups of rice. - OK. It's our anniversary tomorrow! - I'll take you anywhere you want. - Really? Even Pagudpud? You're so sweet. Here's your favorite, Gege! Mm! Mm! Slow down, Gege! There's gonna be more. I feel like I won't have this anymore in Manila. - This is the first thing that I will miss! - I know being a medical technician's hard. But if you feel exhausted, don't hesitate to call. Or if you can, visit the Monasterio de Tarlac! If I have time. Hey, don't say that! Don't act like that! Just go to the monastery, OK? You always make jokes. Lord, have mercy. Send me a boyfriend. I still want to become a doctor someday, but the priority is a boyfriend. That was fast, Lord! I'm not even done with my prayer yet! Are you sure that's him, Lord? Final answer? Oh my God! He's so cute! Hey! Why are you so fidgety? I'm not. - Let's go! - Wait, I'm not done yet. - Let's go! - Sister! - Come on, let's go! - Sis! Happy Graduation! Thank you! Gege, medical school will be next, right? It feels surreal! I made it! - You will still go on, right? - Yes! Yes! - Fight! - Fight! Stop eating and take our photo. Everyone, let's take a picture. One, two, three. Smile! OK, guys, by tomorrow I'd like you to prepare for the group report, OK? - Yes, sir! - Class dismissed! - Can I partner with you? - Sorry, I already have a partner. Really? But you told me you'd partner with me... - Hi! - Hello. Where are we going to study today? The thing is, if we're going to study out, it will just be more one-sided learning. The professor's hairline is distracting me! - Hey, groupmates? - Do I have a choice? Yes! - Let's eat first, please? - Sure! I can't focus when I'm hungry. - I need rice. - Where do you want? - Somewhere cheap. Your treat? - I know a place. - Of course! My treat! - Extra rice? - Unlimited rice! - Let's go! Unlimited? - Here we are. - Thanks! - Sure thing. - Very kind! - Take care! - Thank you! Mrs. Tasing, I'm here! Mrs. Tasing! - It's only 10:03! - Marge? Marge? It's only three minutes after curfew! Please open the gate! Stay here inside the car. There are so many mosquitoes out there! You're right! - That Mrs. Tasing! - Are you sure? Yes! It's better if you stay here. There are no curfews. No, what I meant was, do you really want me to be your roommate? Because I'm a real mess. My hair falls everywhere. My fart smells horrible! And most importantly, I have no money for rent. Don't worry, I got you. And to be honest, I get lonely here. My boyfriend rarely comes here. So, it's beneficial for the both of us. You're too kind! So, are you ready? Let's leave Mrs. Tasing there alone! Yeah! Whoo! Hey! Marge! OK, here I got you! I beat all of you! Sit down there. - Are you still good? - Yes! Let's dance! Hey! Hey! Marge! Hey! Marge! Marge! Girl! Girl! I need to pee. Oh my God, my head hurts! Last night was intense! What did you guys have me drink? Anyway, I'm not sure about this but... do you remember what I told you? About five years ago at the Monasterio de Tarlac? The handsome guy I saw. He was there last night! Girl! He was so hot! I'm sure it was him! It was really him... Sorry! Ann left already. I was about to, too, but I took a shower first. It's your turn. Uh... I left my underwear inside! I said I'm busy. I can't go. - Hey! Are you listening? - Don't move. Wait. Look at me. Up or down? Up. Nice! It's up. Blow and make a wish! Good. What was your wish? World peace! That's so corny! You're wasting your wish! That is my wish! What's wrong with that? If that was mine, I'd wish that... you would come with me to Zambales. - Next week! Please! It's my art exhibit. - So persistent! I can't go, I need to study! Study along the way, please! I don't want to get lonely on the road. Why can't you just ask Ann? She doesn't like these things. She's not into my art. They're all distractions for her. Is that why you're asking me? Because you know I'd say yes? - Yes. - Really? And I'm sure you can't say no to me. Please? Say yes! Why are you playing hard to get? You're not even that pretty! You jerk! - Come on... - Why is it so dark? Oh, babe. Hi, babe! I thought we had no electricity! Mike was just being dramatic. He likes to dim the light. He overdid it! My fault again? You know it's bad to work under dim lights, right? I know, I told her so. So, anyway, let's get dinner? OK! This one will get another free dinner! Lucky you! She's so full of herself sometimes. I have money! But you don't! - Let's go! - Let's go! Babe, why didn't you dress up? Why? What's wrong with my clothes? We're just going to have dinner. I told you that you can leave your stuff at my place, just in case. I know that. But can we just have a casual meal? At Mister Kaloy's place, they have delicious food. Specially the sizzling pork. Am I right, Marge? I just want to have a decent dinner with you. It's our monthsary. Uh... Mister Kaloy's place is quite decent, I think. Happy monthsary to you both! Thank you, Marge! Thank you, third wheel! What? Aren't you the third wheel? Hey, Marge. It's our monthsary today, right? So, I'll sleep in her place tonight, and you stay in the streets. Don't listen to him! You're not sleeping in the streets. OK, not in the streets. How about at Mister Kaloy's place? Stop it. Let's have a toast! Happy monthsary! - Happy monthsary! - Hey, join us! - No, it's your celebration. - Come on, join us! Happy monthsary! - To another beautiful month! - Yes! - What is that? - What? Is that you and Mike's alien version? Stop it! This is me making an effort, OK? Look at it! It looks stupid! I know he sees me as the enemy, because I don't always support his art and music. So, here. The simplest art I can do to show him that I appreciate him. You know, the best way to show your support to Mike is to show up. Go to one of his exhibits. He'll love that. Do you mean he still does exhibits? No, what I mean is, if he has a new exhibit. Marge, I only want what's best for him. I may seem very controlling, but he's been shifting courses. I just want him to focus. As much as possible, I don't want him to get distracted. But seriously, do we really look like aliens? - Yes. - Really? Especially Mike. But he does look like one in real life. Let's eat? - Go eat your food. - OK. Save those aliens for later. All right. Let's eat. I'm sure there's a lot of foreigners where we're going. They'll like your low class. - They love exotic girls! - You idiot! Seriously! They will follow you around when they see you, that's for sure. What's your problem? I'm just scared, you know. What if Ann finds out about this? She'll kill me. You don't have to be scared as long as this remains a secret. OK, look. When someone takes a photo, we stay out of their way. Or if we can't avoid it, if someone flips out their phone and says, "Hey, picture!" We'll just cover our faces. Like this... Or like this, smile! Will you stop that! You're forgetting our reason for coming there in the first place. We're going to that festival for fun! For enjoyment! Let's indulge in the visual arts, music! - Right? Be in control of your happiness! - So we'll have fun. - Right? - OK. Why don't you tell that to Ann also? You're such a coward. Hey! Hey! That was a joke! Don't take it too seriously. I was just kidding! I was just... You're so dramatic. Look at you! This is my moment. You're stealing my spotlight. Thank you. Thank you for doing this. I know that you know... how important this art exhibit is for me. Anyway, I'll just take a nap. - She's so good! - She even does this. - She's amazing. - And she does this. Give me six months and I could do that fire dance. - Six months? - Yes! - That's so easy. - Really? Why don't you try it now? - Are you crazy? - Why? Do you want me to be cooked alive? I'd put you on a skewer and sell you like they do barbeques! Who wants to try? - She wants to try! - Come on! Come on! Try it! Come on, please?

How are you? - How are you? - Good! - Miss me? - Yes! I missed you! You look great! - How are you? - I'm good. Don't be jealous! She's his sister. Me? Jealous? No way! Yuck! They used to go here together. But sadly, she had to go to the US. His entire family is there already. I know. I'm Kylie. One of Mike's friends when he stays here. Margie. I'm a friend... anywhere. - "Friend"? - Yes! I'm his friend! - Mike? Yuck! - It's OK! See you tonight at the bonfire? Yes. Ciao! Yes. - Nice meeting you! - Bye! Now? OK, I'd like that. - This is her. So... - Hi, Margie. Cheers! Again? Hey, man! How are you? Let's drink? I'll head over to you guys later! You know what, Margie. My brother has told me a lot of things about you. - So many stories. - What? Don't listen to him! What are you saying? She came from the US, so talk to her in English. - Don't use Tagalog. - So dramatic. She has many stories! You know, don't believe in what he says. OK? Just don't believe... - That's enough! You did it! - I know! - You didn't panic! - I know that. Yeah! But, you know, he told me you're the most fun person he's ever met. Never a dull moment! Am I not to believe that? Right? It's nice! It's true. It's true! Cheers! Cheers! I'm sorry, sister. I just don't want to see them tonight. Fine. Just take care of yourself there, OK? Merry Christmas, Gege! Merry Christmas to everyone there! I love you, sister! I love you too! - What are you doing here? - You already know the answer to that. Everyone in my family is in the States. And Ann doesn't want me to see her family, because she's very "proud" of me. So, I'll just stay here. If that's OK with you. I don't want to go home. I don't want to face them. Uh... Did you ever think that... maybe they're just protecting you, and that's why they never said anything? I'm already 22. I can understand stuff like that. I can even celebrate if they want. Wow. So, you think you can face your half-siblings? Of course I can! Well, in that case, let's make a toast! To what? Let me think... To us! Holiday orphans! Cheers! By the way...

It's more than enough. What about Ann? I'll break up with her officially. Look... Like I said, I am not happy being with her. She loves this... this idea of me, but not who I really am. She's my friend. And I'm her boyfriend. For her own sake, I'll do this for her. Knowing that I don't love her anymore, that... It's not going to work, OK? You're the one I love. - You're just drunk. - I'm not drunk! I know what I'm saying. You love me, right? From the first time you saw me at the monastery. You're assuming. I heard every word you said outside the bathroom door, remember? You're making me commit to an affair against my friend. - Mike... No! - No, it's not... - It's not. - No. - It's not an affair! - Mike, no. OK? Listen to me. Look at me! Hey! Don't be naïve. Don't act as if this happened on the spur of the moment. No! We both know this was bound to happen, we just tried to suppress it. But, please this time... This time, let's follow our hearts. Just for once, let's be selfish. I have a new exhibit, and I want you to be there. I'll introduce you to my friends as... ...as my girlfriend. I'll wait for you. The place where we first met, when I first saw you. I'll wait for you there. At that same spot. OK? If you show up... we're in this together. Happy Holidays! Um. Good thing you're back. Happy Holidays! Ta-da! - What's that? - A present for you! Um. I didn't know you'd be... Don't worry about it! At least, one less gift for this year. What do you mean? - It's Mike. - Mike? What about him? Did he tell you something? He said he needed space. The day after Christmas. Merry fucking Christmas, right? I guess it's time to think things through. So, you and Mike are done? You broke up already? I don't know. Maybe? I don't want to talk to him. I don't even want to talk about him. WHAT TIME ARE YOU COMING HOME?

OK! - Mike, she's had too much. - No! - She's had enough! - I know her. Keep drinking! - Bottoms up! Cheers! - Cheers! Are you sure? Drink! Are you OK? - From tonight until eternity! - She's drunk. This... this will be my home. - This will be forever. - Come on, drink it up. My home. WHERE ARE YOU? WE NEED TO REVIEW! Good vibes. ...to whatever makes you happy! Because life is too short. To spend it sad or angry. - Cheers! - Cheers. Cheers. Hold on to whatever makes you happy. So, I'm holding you tight. - OK, lie down. - Huh? Thank you! For what? For being here. For always being by my side. You're kidding. I'm not! I'm being serious. Can I hug you? Seriously, thank you. - Someone's drowning! - Help! Help! Kylie? Kylie? Help her! That's Kylie! Kylie! Kylie! You're a Med student, Marge. Do something, save her, Marge! - Marge! - Marge! - Do something! - OK. She's not breathing! Kylie! Kylie, wake up! Wake up! Kylie? Kylie! Kylie. Kylie. Kylie, wake up. Kylie, please. I'm sorry. I said I'm sorry. It's OK. - Marge? - I said I'm OK! I'm fine! We're good! Everything is good! Stop saying sorry! Marge... You can do it. Hello, there's an emergency here. A motorcycle accident... Please, help my girlfriend... You can do it, Marge. You can save her. Excuse me, ma'am, please step aside. One, two, three, four, five. Positive pulse. Thank you, ma'am! You did great, Marge. Watch the neck. Miss, please don't move. Just relax. I'm proud of you. Thank you. Why didn't you continue... with medical studies? You suddenly dropped out after what happened. So much happened. Besides, my perspective changed. Do you still think about what happened? I think we should rest. Let's find a hostel. It's been a long day. - Good evening! - Hi! Good evening! Two rooms. "Two rooms"? Yes, two please. I'm sorry, we only have one room left. That's fine, we'll take it. The symptoms of stroke may develop suddenly or over a period of several minutes. The patient may collapse and lose consciousness. So, in case you're in the vicinity and you encounter someone who appears to be experiencing a stroke, what should you do? Ms. Suarez? MIKE, WHERE ARE YOU? MEET ME. I NEED YOU. We should lay down the patient in a comfortable position with his head and shoulders slightly elevated. OK, so you'll lay down the patient. What else? Ms. Concepcion? You can perform CPR if the patient is not breathing... I'll just go to the restroom. I'M HERE AT THE RESTAURANT. WHERE ARE YOU? - Why aren't you answering? - Marge, not here, please. Mike. Mike! Mike. Mike! - Are you ashamed of me? - "Ashamed"? Of course not! Then why are you avoiding me? I just need time and space to figure things out! I am confused right now. And it doesn't help when I see you. What? What does that mean? It means that seeing you reminds me of the things that I tried so desperately to forget. How much of a coward I am, how I cheated on Ann, and about someone's death! So, I make you feel less? It's not your fault, all right? It's my fault that I cheated on Ann! It's my fault that I used you, instead of fixing my problems! I'm sorry! - So, you just used me? - No! This is exactly the reason why I don't want to talk. I'm staying away from you because you remind me of that night when Kylie died! I made her drink too much! Had I not done that, she would still be alive today. I keep coming back to that moment. Seeing that image slowly slipping away from all of us. So, in a way... you're blaming me... for Kylie's death? Huh? Mike? - Mike, answer me! - I don't know! Maybe! What do you want to hear? OK. You failed her! Is that it? - I'm a failure. - Yes, you're a failure. You are a failure. You've had your chance to save her. You failed! Are you satisfied? You failed to save our friend. You know what, I don't know if... How many apologies I've made but... it still feels inadequate. So, again... I am sorry. You asked me why I didn't continue with medical school. Because I... I got scared. After what happened... ...it made me depressed. But now I realize... I have you... finally. Because... I've loved you for so long. Finally, you took a chance on me. I was so happy! I was so happy with you. But you took all that away... when you and Anne got back together. I am nothing compared to Ann. You know what, I have no excuse. I used you as my escape. Until I had to run away from you. You did not deserve any of this. I made you feel small and I'm sorry. Those things I said to you... I didn't mean it. You're not a failure. That was me! I was the failure. I failed so many people in my life. That includes you. Especially you. It was all my fault. I was a fool. I was a fool, too. I betrayed my own best friend. I took off and went back home without coming clean. I couldn't stay with her knowing that I'd betrayed her. But I was also a coward for not being honest with her. But that was five years ago. Five years have passed. Maybe she moved on? Maybe it's about time to see her and check on her. - I can't do it. - Of course you can. Now you can. I know you're sick and tired of hearing this. But I'm really, really sorry... for everything. ♪ Spring is following the stars ♪ - ♪ Slowly disappearing in the dark ♪ - Good morning, Mike! - ♪ It's getting harder to get to you ♪ - Good morning! ♪ It's getting harder just to be ♪ - Put on some music. - You don't want silence, huh? ♪ 'Cause I want you... ♪ - Do you know that I made that? - Which one?

We've been running around in circles here. OK! Um, is it OK if I stay here and rest for a bit? - Sure. Just come out and follow me? - OK. Do you know where Paulo Solis lives? Over there... - Tag, you're it! - Where are you going? Good afternoon! Go inside. Mr. Paulo Solis? Ma'am? You're the one from the clinic, right? Come in. I'm really sorry. It was all my fault. But I'm assuring you, I'm doing everything I can for you to get the job. That's OK. We all make mistakes. But I'm sorry that you had to travel all the way here. My cellphone got stolen. But you need to go to Manila as soon as possible to retake the drug test. - I already booked a flight for you today. - All right. - Daddy! - Lois! You're so pretty, miss! Thank you! - This is my daughter, Lois. - You're pretty too, Lois. Thank you! Can you be my mommy? What are you talking about? Stop that, Lois! Mike? Mike? Miss, did you see a man inside the car earlier? No, we didn't see anyone. - OK. Thank you! - You're welcome. Mike? Mike? - Mike? - Mike? Mike? What's wrong with him? He always disappears like that. I'm sure he's fine. It may not look like it, but it's safe here. Yes, maybe. It seems like you really love this place. Why are you leaving? I need money. I need a lot of money. My daughter has a hereditary heart condition. She got it from her mother... who passed away. - I'm sorry. - It's OK! No problem! That's life. Where could your friend have gone? Let's not worry about him. He knows what he's doing. I'll be fine right here, Ms. Margie. I'll just ride a tricycle to the airport. - Are you sure? - Yes. I don't want to cause any more trouble. All right! Just go straight to the clinic when you get to Manila. - It's urgent, OK? - OK. - Thanks! - Take care! Take care, too! Thank you! And I hope you find your friend. Don't worry about him. He's always like that. OK. Can I hug you? Um... Goodbye! Goodbye. Fool. Why are you crying? You're the fool! Am I? After all that you've done? Really? Come in! I don't know why, but I expected you to be here. So, I prepared your favorite tuna pasta. Sit down! Let's eat. Sit down. Do you still remember? This is our favorite, also Mike's. What's wrong with you? The way you said Mike's name, it sounded so casual. What do you mean? I cheated with Mike. Back when you were still together. I was your best friend. I'm so cheap. What? We'll just act like it's nothing? Aren't you mad at me? Come on, hurt me! Give me what I deserve. Get mad at me, please! Marge, I knew. I knew it all along. I was hurt and I felt betrayed. But I just had to accept it. I'm sorry... I've already forgiven you. I was just waiting for you. Come on, let's eat! Let's eat. So, anyway, have you already visited Mike? Huh? "Visited"? - Did you see each other? - Yes. I went to see him yesterday. Um, what do you mean? Don't you know? Margie, it's OK. What happened? There was marijuana found in his blood when he got into a car accident. He is using it to relieve his pain, but his vision gets really bad because of his brain tumor. - Brain tumor? - Yes. He was diagnosed this year. Mom wanted it to be a secret from everyone. For Mike's sake. For his reputation. That's why there was a total news blackout. I just got home from the States. I'm sorry, I wasn't able to tell you. When did this happen? Three nights ago. - Three nights ago? - Yes. No. That's impossible! How can it be three nights ago? Another chat? Don't follow me! Can I take your order, ma'am? Mike, you want anything? Good evening. Two rooms. I'm such a fool! I betrayed my best friend. Good morning, Mike! Mike!

I'm sorry. I got your address from your workmates. I just need to tell you something. Um, sure, but let's go inside first. Paulo, do you want anything? There's coffee here if you want. I came here to say thank you. And to say I'll be going to Dubai soon. That's good to hear! And I'm also... here to apologize. For what? When you accompanied me, and I hugged you. It seemed inappropriate. That's nothing. It's OK. I'm not making excuses but... that's not something I would normally do. It felt wrong. Like I was a different person. Can I hug you? Goodbye. - Mike? - Mike? I'm Paulo. Um, can you come with me? Mike. You look ugly when you cry. You fool! No. Yes, I'm a fool. Yes, that's true. That's why I'm still here. Following you around. Bugging you, asking for forgiveness. Before I cross over. If I say that I... haven't forgiven you yet, will you stay? I don't know. I haven't been a ghost before. You know, the first time I saw you... Well, I was at my lowest. I was so confused, I didn't know where to go. I was failing. My parents always fought each other. And I was asking for something. Anything. A sign. Guidance. Anything. And then I saw you. And I said, God... what an ugly sign... - Idiot. - ...but I'll take it. I have a question. Did you ever love me? Deeply. Too much. The moments we shared... are the highlights of my life. Those are the things I'll tell my fellow angels in heaven. Or fellow demons, right? - We're not sure yet. - Don't say that! Knock on wood. I love you. I love you, too. So much! And, Marge, for the last time... I know you've heard this a million times already but... Last one, I promise. I'm sorry. For everything. This is also the last time... you'll hear this. I beg you. Stop saying you're sorry. Bye, Marge! Until we meet again. Until we meet again, Mike. What's your wish? I wish Lois would get better. How about you? Um, nothing much. A safe journey for an old friend. - Doc Marge? Doc Marge! - Lois. Hi! How are you? - Where's your dad? - He's just outside. - How are you feeling? - I feel OK! That's good! Thank you, Doc Pretty!
