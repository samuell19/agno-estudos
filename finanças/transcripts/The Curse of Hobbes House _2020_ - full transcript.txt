Subtitles by explosiveskull Once upon a time, there was a great war that devastated the land. And when the arms were finally laid down, many a million had been slaughtered and broken, lost and gone forever. The people decided to overthrow their kings and to split the lands equally amongst everyone. Yet, not everyone was equal. Soon, new kings arose, some good and just, some not. When one of the just kings died, he handed his kingdom to his three sons, Dormant, Dunstan, and Drake for them to share the burden of the crown. At first, the three young kings ruled fairly and well, side by side. But Dormant grew jealous of his younger brothers and decided to take their shares for himself. He swiftly had them killed. Without his brothers, Dormant became a tyrant. He surrounded himself with cruel counselors and ruthless minions and exploited the lands and the people. One day, King Dormant came across an old bent over man who sat in front of an old bent over house. The old man's name was Hobbes and the king decided he would take the old man's house and its lands. Old Hobbes was killed and his house was razed to the ground. But old Hobbes was a powerful and wise witcher, and with his dying breath, he spoke a curse. All in the line of King Dormant and all who belong to his land shall be bound in service to it as its protectors and guardians, in life and death. King Dormant laughed in the face of the curse and built a new house and called it Hobbes House, to spite the old witcher. But not long after, the king fell ill and perished in agony. All the while, the house stood strong for generations with the king's descendants as its protectors. This is our family's legacy. We're fucking lost. Nonsense. Where are we then? The old graveyard. There's a family crypt here somewhere. Plenty of developers will be scrambling over this property. Heritage always sells. Our profits will triple, quadruple, we'll be killing it, as long as everyone plays their part. All right? Jacob. Jacob, where are you? This isn't funny. Hello? Jacob, what the fuck? Naser. I'm sorry, Miss Alex, I did not mean to scare you. I'm very tired, Miss Alex. Okay, shouldn't I read you something new, perhaps from the papers? I won't be here much longer. Are you planning a journey, Miss Alex? It's all right, Naser, I'm exhausted. I'll do my rounds then. It's all in here, Naser. Don't forget, even when I'm gone. The mind is a blade, it requires sharpening. Knowledge is... Knowledge is power, I know. Exactly. Always remember the story of the guardians. I will. Good night, Miss Alex. Good night. And Naser? Thank you. And just as Hobbes, the witcher, had pronounced it, in death, as in life, the guardians of Hobbes House will be bound by the curse. When their home is threatened, the guardians will rise to hunt and torment the living. They shall no longer be human. They shall no longer be dead. But they will have become one with the land. They shall not sleep and they shall not rest. They shall neither love nor hate. They will only hunger for the warmth of the living. Their touch will be so cold it will freeze a man's heart. Only by coming together in unity may they be stopped. Only unity can keep you safe. Hey Jane, this is Mand. Yeah, uh listen, it's not working out love so don't bother coming in. Just come round the pub sometime to pick up your wages, all right? Have a nice life, bye. Ugh. Hello? Oh good morning. Am I speaking to Jane Dormant? Who's this? My name is Eury Saul. I'm a solicitor. We had an appointment yesterday. It's about your aunt, Miss Dormant. Your aunt is Alexandra Dormant? Yes, but we didn't have an appointment. Well, my assistant told me she talked to you last week. Oh shit. I mean, I'm sorry, there's a lot going on at the moment. Um, I didn't mean to do this over the phone, Miss Dormant, but I'm afraid I have some bad news. We did try to contact you sooner, but had some trouble finding you. I've moved a lot. I see. I'm so sorry but Alex, but your aunt, passed away three weeks ago. It was an accident. Your aunt did leave a will. It's only to be opened in the presence of her beneficiaries. This must all be very upsetting for you but the thing is, Miss Dormant, the reading of the will was supposed to take place this afternoon at Hobbes House. I'm sure we can reschedule if need be. Miss Dormant, are you still there? Yeah sorry, I um... Let's keep the appointment as it is, I can be at the house this afternoon. Alex, I'm so sorry. Nice car. Oh, you know how it goes, the more expensive it looks, the more high maintenance it is. Miss Dormant, I'm Eury Saul, we spoke on the phone this morning. Shall we go in? If you need a few moments to collect your thoughts, I can wait for you in the study. We can proceed when you're ready. What kind of accident did Alex have exactly? When did you last see your aunt? A few years ago. She wasn't well and hadn't been for quite some time. She'd become a bit of a recluse and was depressed. At the end, she'd let go of all of her staff, except for her groundskeeper. But what does this have to do with her accident? Your aunt suffered a rather dark episode. I'm afraid she took her own life. When was the funeral? On the 31st of January, I attended myself. Alex and I, your aunt and I, we were friends. She's buried in the family crypt if you'd like to visit. Are you sure it was a suicide? Look, I know this is a lot to take in, Miss Dormant, if you need some time... Time doesn't change anything. The groundskeeper, is it still the old German guy, Helmut? He smokes like a chimney. He must be a 100 years old by now. He survived Alex, who would've thought? Oh, who are you? I'm Naser, hello. Since Mr. Schmidt's passing Naser has been taking care of his duties. Pleased to meet you. Look who the cat dragged in. Jennifer? I go by Janny now, it gets me more followers. You're here? I was invited. Your aunt was very clear on that particular point. She wanted her next of kin and Mr. Mohammedan present at the reading of her will. Jesus, Jane. Who are you? Name is Nigel Thatcher. I'm Janny's partner. Pleasure to meet you. I think you owe your sister some gratitude. You don't know what I owe my half sister. I'm just saying she took care of everything, the funeral, the wake, everything and that's all while still running her vlog. Don't, babe. No one ever talked to you like that darling. I know it's none of my business, but we were very fond of Alex. We called her every week and came to see her as often as we could. You're right, I don't know anything about you or your relationship with your aunt, but let's all try and get some closure today. Fine. Right, I'm all set up in the study. "To my nieces, Jane and Jennifer Dormant, "and to my trusted dear friend, Naser Mohammedan. "When you read this, I will no longer be with you. "For whatever lies ahead, "you must always remember that knowledge is power." Oh God. What? Your little show. My show? Janny. Are you saying I'm fake? Well what else would you call those crocodile tears? You're seriously doing this right now? I just find it a bit of a waste. There's no one here for you to impress. Oh, you're so full of it. How dare you? - Janny, please. - No, I won't. Didn't I tell you she was an utter dimwit? I tell you what Janny, why don't you take your fake attitude, your lies and your privileged little life and go and fuck yourself? Go back to bloody Berlin to your fucking father and that thieving witch you call a mother. Oh, Jane Dormant, queen of the dramatic exit. Good riddance, sister, see you never. I'll go and make the tea. What was that? I don't know. If she leaves, the whole thing is out the window. I'm sorry. It's her, she always knew how to push my buttons. You have to go after her. What? Why? You're the only one who can convince her not to leave. What a nightmare, hey? It's hard to believe they're related to Alex. Well, what can you do with people like Jane? In my experience, it's all misguided expectations. Everything will be just fine, Miss Saul, as long as everyone plays their part. What a bunch of assholes. This is your car? Fuck off. Wait a second, are you living in this thing? I said, fuck off. Listen, I'm sorry. What are you sorry for? It's life. I lost a mother too when she died, you know? Yeah well you got another one, I got the boot. That wasn't my decision. Let's not do this again, please. How's the tea coming along? Fine. You're from Syria, is that right? Good tea there? Yes, very good tea. Look, what happened earlier in the study, siblings, am I right? Siblings? You know brothers, and sisters. Yes, they fight sometimes. I have two brothers and two sisters. We fought all the time. When was the last time you saw them? Three years ago. Perhaps you'll see them again soon. I can't imagine what it must be like for you all alone so far from home. I might know someone who can get you home. I just want to be your friend Naser. In return, I want you to tell me exactly what happened the night Alex died. I told the police what happened. Ah, yes. "She shot herself, I came running into the study, I saw her lying there, I applied first aid, I was a nurse in Syria, and then I called the police." It says here they couldn't find a suicide note. Oh come on. There's still something that doesn't make sense to me. Why would Alex include you in her will? To be honest, Naser, the police around here aren't the smartest. I've dealt with them before. They're simply not cut out for suicide or fraud or murder. Luckily, I've got some good contacts at Scotland Yard, you know? They'll be able to shed some light on the matter and figure out what really happened to Alex. Perhaps I'll make a few calls. What do you think? Yeah, perhaps you should, Mr. Nigel. Don't leave like this. A blackout? Good thinking, 99. Perhaps we should go check everyone's all right. Jane? Better be worth it. Are you coming? Perhaps it's the power line. What was that? It's nothing to worry about, Mr. Nigel. It's just the wind, see? What the hell? We found her like this. Hello? Hello, Miss Saul? Hello, Miss Saul, can you hear me? Miss Saul, can you hear me? You call an ambulance. Get the blanket, we need to cover her. I can't find a signal. Me neither. Miss Saul? Miss Saul! The line is dead. Let's just take it to the car. Take her to the hospital ourselves. No, no, we could hurt her if we move her. She might die if we don't. Okay, we use the blanket as a stretcher. Here, let me show you. Open the car door. It's locked. Hold on, just check her pockets. I can't find her keys. Take her. We'll take my car. Did you look properly? We're running out of time here, Jane. We have to hurry. - Come on. - Get this thing going. Okay. Got it, got it, got it. Don't do this to me now, you rusty excuse of a car. Oh for god's sake. Turn that bloody noise off! That's it. What do you mean that's it? Jesus christ, Jennifer, your sister's wrecked her bloody car. I knew I should've driven. Open the bonnet, please. Where are you going? Make sure you keep her head up. What a fucking joke. Don't leave me with her. You'll be fine, sis. Probably the cooler, perhaps the pistons. Can you fix it? No, Nigel the piston's have seized. English please. My car's fucked, all right, the bloody car is fucked. Nigel. Calm down, no need to yell like that. Don't tell me what to do. Guys? It's my car, all right? Jane, it's Saul, I think she's dead. What? Miss Saul? Miss Saul? Hello Miss Saul? Miss Saul, can you hear me? Hello Miss Saul, can you hear me? She just stopped breathing. Wait here. We couldn't save her. I saw something in the woods, a shadow, I think it was watching me. Don't worry darling. We have to go back to the house now. What about the dead lawyer on my back seat? What are you doing? I'm locking the car. We have to secure it. Is that your old Walkman? Who's gonna steal this old banger? No offense. Whatever. Can I have my keys back? Yes, but we have to go back to the house now. Please, come on, let's hurry, come on. I take it you aren't expecting visitors? What's he doing? I have no idea. Looks like this isn't the first time the lights have gone out. Is it just me or is Naser acting a bit weird? Perhaps it's his PTSD. PTSD? Aunt Alex said it's from his time in Syria. So he's a nutter. You're kidding, right? Aunt Alex took him in a year ago. There were never any issues. She really liked him. Yeah, but why do we have to deal with his problem? We've got enough of our own. So fucking hypocritical. Janny, you've got to admit it's all a bit odd. Alex takes her own life after adding a complete stranger to her will and now Saul. There's something going on here. So you're saying that Naser killed Alex and somehow got away with it? Look, you said it yourself, he's acting weirdly. All I'm saying is we don't know him yet he has the keys and he knows his way around the house. And he knows that there's a shotgun in the cellar. - He might snap and go for us. - Jesus christ, seriously? We shouldn't let our guard down. That's all I'm saying. Where is he anyway? Naser? Naser? Stop shouting, please, you'll wake the dead. What are you doing? The candles. Stop that! Naser! See, he's violent. Did you get rough like that with my aunt too? I didn't do anything. Tell that to my dead aunt. Miss Alex took her own life. Oh and how convenient that she added you to the will just before she kicked it. Miss Alex took me in when I had nowhere to go. She was kind when nobody else was. She prepared me to take care of this house and she told me about the curse and about the guardians. Do you hear yourself? The shadows that you see, I see them too. Ever since miss Alex has gone, there's been something out there in this forest. It's them. They're coming. It's all in here. Miss Alex told me all about it. It's the guardians. The dead are rising and they are coming after us. He's gone mad. Give me your keys. What? We don't know what he's capable of. Jane, this isn't right. Give him your keys. On you go. When the undead come for you, you should run. Did you see the look in his eyes? This isn't right. You believe his story of how Alex prepared him to protect the house of undead guardians? It's a horror story for children, Janny. At least I'm not locking people up on a hunch. Undead, whatevers or not, I wouldn't mind getting out of here as soon as possible. Why, are you scared? Of course not. But to be honest, the only reason we're all here is the will, isn't it? The sooner we know what it says, the sooner we can all move on with our lives. What do you suggest then? Let's find out what's in the will and get the hell out of here. Naser should be there too. Screw that. I prefer him locked up in the drawing room. Shouldn't we at least go to the police or get a lawyer before we deal with the will? Once the police and lawyers are involved, it'll take months. Hand me your lighter, please. Do you guys think there was something going on between Saul and Aunt Alex? What difference does it make? Jane, what is it? What does it say then? What was that? Perhaps it was the undead guardians. Maybe we shouldn't answer. You two really are a match made in heaven. Who is it? Come on, let's go, let's go, come on! What was that? A guardian, an undead. That's impossible. Don't worry, I don't think they can unlock doors. How did you get out? Spare set of keys. Let's check on the others. Miss Jennifer? Mr. Nigel? Naser? Jane. What happened? Who was that maniac? Saul. She's alive? I don't know. She's dead, but... not. But we locked her in the car. I saw her die, Naser. Oh she died, but then she rose again. And now she hunts the living. She tried to rip my throat out, I can tell you that much. And her touch was freezing. There was something uncanny about her. If it hadn't have been for him, she would've killed me. So he killed her? You cannot kill what is already dead. She is one of the guardians now. The undead have risen and they are coming after us. It's all in here. All I want is to get out of here. The only working car is locked and we can't find Saul's keys. That's her jacket. What are you doing? Got ya. Good thinking, 99. Be careful. There might be more of the undead out there. See, there's nothing out here. Come on, give them to him. It's one of those bio thingies. What? Let me see. Oh fuck. Can we please keep quiet? I don't want the guardians to hear us. We need Saul's fingerprint to activate the car. Why the long faces? We only need Saul's finger. Mr. Nigel, please whisper. Oh just- Please babe, we should leave Saul alone, she's too dangerous. What do you suggest we do darling? What about granddad's motorbike? We can't fit four grown people on a motorbike. We can try. How do you even know it's still working? She's got a point, darling. Anyway, Alex might've sold it. It wouldn't hurt to look. I know the bike you mean. I moved it over there to the garage. There isn't a garage. Miss Alex asked me to set it up over there. A garage? It's called a garden. Follow me. What's all this? They're waiting to be shipped. Shipped where? Home. To Syria? Yes. Miss Alex said I could take anything I want from the house to help rebuild my country. What is it? I saw something by the edge of the woods. I'm not sure what it was. We have to hurry, the guardians are coming. I've nearly finished fixing it. It will need petrol though. I can take a jerry can and get petrol from Saul's car. You'll need two lengths of tubing and something to seal the mouth of the petrol tank. What? I did a piece on greening for my channel. Here. You'll need to be quiet. Don't make a sound. Don't use your light either. They're drawn by the light. You shouldn't go by yourself. Please take Nigel with you. What? You didn't have to come with me. It's not for your sake. Do you always do everything she says? We're not that kind of couple. What does that even mean? You know what? I don't want to know. Fuck it's diesel. So? You can't put diesel in a motor bike, it breaks. I'll get petrol from my car. Have you ever removed petrol from a car before? You've seen my car, what do you think? That you need a new car. Yeah, I need new car, new clothes and a new life. And from my share I can get all that. That's why you're here? Well, I know that's why you and Jennifer are. Where does this go? Let me show you. Come under the tarpaulin with me. I need you to hold my lamp so I can see. Were you in the army? Why do you ask that? How do you know so much about engines? I was a nurse. But before the war, I often watched my friend Dapter, he was a mechanic. He had very skilled hands. Good, strong hands. And he was smart, one of the smartest people I've ever known. Was he a close friend? Where is he now? I don't know, home. I left when the war came, he stayed. Please, can you look in the back? There should be more of these in a box. It says engine parts. Please don't use the torch. This place is really creepy. Yeah, well, there's a reason for all the stories. What stories? There's a legend about an old pagan curse and spell or something. It says that anyone who lives on this land becomes its servant and anyone who dies here becomes its guardian. And when the land is under siege, you're doomed to rise and fight the threat. You certainly know how to tell a good story, the undead rising. I just wonder what upset them. Naser, why was Alex getting rid of all her stuff? Miss Alex was worried. She thought she was going to lose the house. That's why she was trying to sell everything she could. Why would she lose the house? There were letters. Miss Alex was in trouble. I'm just gonna go sit down. - I feel a bit light headed. - Of course. Oh my God. Nigel, what have you done? [Nigel Let's get the petrol and get back to the house. Nigel, what are you doing? Switch off the light. Nigel, the light. Did you hear that? They're close. I'm almost done. Nigel! Bloody coward. What is it, Naser? We're missing parts. The bike, I can't fix it. I read the letter. Nigel! They're out there, in the woods, they attacked us. They came out of nowhere. Nigel, baby, slow down. Where is Jane? There was nothing I could do. You left her behind? They're everywhere. Jane didn't want to leave without the petrol. I did everything I could. They're coming. We have to go help her. That's suicide, Janny. Nigel, you left her behind. We have to go, over the wall. Here, take this. These will get you through the back door. Are you...? I'll cover you. Go! Run, run! They're coming! Go, go! No, no, no! Some sacrifices have to be made for the greater good. No, no, no! Ahhh! Allah! Mr. Nigel! Mr. Nigel! No! No! The shotgun! Jennifer, Nigel, is that you? Jane! I thought they got you. It was close enough. Where's Naser? Close the damn door. Jennifer, what happened? He didn't make it. Fuck, give me the keys. The petrol, it's in the great hall. Jane, Naser couldn't fix the bike. So I risked my life for nothing? Naser lost his life for nothing. Not much we could've done, they got him. The same way they got me, you mean? I did what I had to. And what was that exactly? I ran to get the help. You left me to die. I warned the others, didn't I? Yes. Shh, come on, it's all right darling. Not for Naser it isn't. You're such a hypocrite. You didn't give a damn about him. I didn't leave anyone to die though, did I? We have to look after ourselves first. Janny, tell her. Have it your way but don't kid yourselves, those undead, whatever they are, they're out there and if you want to survive, you'll do what it takes. Your sister is ruining everything. Jennifer, you do realize she's fucking everything up? I realize you are. Where did you get that? You knew it was a rotten investment that Alex made from the start. It was high risk. Your aunt knew that. But she only did it because you told her to. Even if she lost out, you would win, the bank would win. The banks always win, Jennifer. But why, Nigel? You knew she would do everything to repay her debts and keep the estate. And you would get paid double? It's just good business, Janny, doubling the profits. And who in their right mind would pass on that? Don't get me wrong, you can profit from this too. Hell even Jane could have profited if she had the sense to play her part. You've seen her moods, how difficult she is. It's not worth us trying to come to an agreement with her. We don't need her. I'm sorry that came out wrong... I get it, Nigel. Nigel! Get out of the way! Nigel, the keys! Would you stop pacing please? I don't understand how you can just sit there. They've got us trapped. You're pacing won't help. Neither does your nagging. Whatever issues you two have got going on right now, this is not the time or the place. What's your plan anyway? Wait till they lose interest? You're angry with me right now, I get it. You may not want to hear this but your sister won't get us out of here. We have to take matters into our own hands if we want to survive. I'm so done with your bullshit. My bullshit? You always knew exactly what was going on and you never objected. This is me objecting. Jennifer. Jane, I have to tell you something. What's this? It's nothing, Janny's just upset. Jane, Alex was in debt up to her ears and Nigel and I knew. For months she was selling all of her belongings just to pay back the bank, Nigel's bank. What did you do? It wasn't me. It was the bank. And you didn't help her? Neither did your sister. Is that true? It is. I was wrong, I'm sorry. Yeah well, he should have known better. So should I. All I saw was the money. You did too, we all did. Naser was the only one that didn't, he just wanted a home. Yeah and now he's dead. We can't afford to lose anyone else. Jane, listen to me, he's just a cog in the machine. Peace? Duly noted. May I ask how you two geniuses plan to get us out of here? Our only vehicle is locked and the phones are useless. I've got an idea, it's just not gonna be pretty. Are you sure this is the only way to get Saul's fingerprints? Well, we can't just cut off a finger. The scanner can detect if there's no pulse. How do you know if she still even has a pulse? I don't know, it's just worth a try. Remember no skin contact. That's how they suck the life out you. Now we just need to get her attention. Come on, Janny, you can do it, she's dead. Janny, take her, take her. Come on. I'll do it, take over here. Nigel. He's leaving us behind. Nigel, open the door! We've got to go. Shut up! Come on. Hold still, you rotting piece of shit. Come on. Yes! That was Aunt Alex. Not anymore. She's gone, Janny. How do you feel? Dizziness, sickness? Just cold. Bastard! What is it? Is someone coming? Nigel, he's taken Saul's car. I need to disinfect the wound. You're as cold as ice. What does that fairy tale book say about turning into one of them? What are you looking for? Mom's secret stash. You think now's the time to get drunk? Bingo. Don't move. How many shells have you got left? Two. Fitting. Knowledge is power all right. Ugh. How did we end up here, Jane? We were normal sisters once, weren't we? There was never anything normal about us. Do you remember when we visited grand and grandad and we ran away? Yeah, we ended up in the walled garden, didn't we? I don't even know why we did that. I think you really loved Huckleberry Finn at the time and you thought it was something the cool kids did. I remember now. And wasn't mum talking to gran and granddad and we were shuffling about and packing our backpacks? Then we wandered off, had a picnic and we were back by four. Mom was so upset. They made such a fuss. A few minutes later, they would've called the police. That was the last time we were all in this house. A month later, granddad died. And then gran and then... Mom. I remember her singing to me when she'd put me to sleep. ♪ She wept, she toiled ♪ ♪ Her youth had been spoiled ♪ I miss her. ♪ She'd had it all planned ♪ ♪ Oh she'd done all the work ♪ I can't believe you kept this old Walkman all these years. Me neither. Mom's songs helped me get through some pretty rough times. I'm sorry for the way things happened, Jane. It was dad's decision to leave you behind. 'Cause I'm not his flesh and blood? But you've always been mine. You could have said something. I was a kid, Jane. All I wanted was a sister and mother and a home. And all I gave you was anger. Here's to family, however screwed up they might be. Ahh. I've just had an idea how we can get out of here. Don't Janny. No listen, the tandem. What? Our tandem, it's in the walled garden, I've seen it, we can ride it out of here. You want out-cycle a hoard of blood-freezing undead on a tandem? Jennifer, it's all right, it's not your fault. We have to hurry. No more fighting. Live or die together, sister. I love you. I love you too. Ready? Ready. They're catching up, go faster. I'm trying. You've got to pedal in sync with me. Put on your Walkman. I need a rhythm to cycle to. It's working! Do you see him anywhere? Has he turned into one of them? To my nieces, Jane and Jennifer Dormant, it is time for you to put aside your differences. After my passing, you will be the sole heirs to Hobbes House. Whatever you do, you must never sell the property or the land. The old stories about the guardians are real. They will come for you and anyone who tries to cause harm to the land. Our family's legacy now falls on you, the protectors of Hobbes House. Only unity will keep you safe. Aunt Alex left us Hobbes House. That means we're in debt. Looks like it. Jane, the banks, they won't let us off the hook that easily. They'll do everything they can to keep the property. We can't let that happen. We have to stick together from now on. We better make it count. Subtitles by explosiveskull
