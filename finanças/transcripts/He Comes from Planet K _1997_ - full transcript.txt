Where did I stop? You'd just mentioned the Bible Code. Three years ago, scientists finally decoded it by computer. It's just like... a woman wearing bra... after removing her bra, everything is clear. Did I use such an indecent metaphor? No! I added that for you. The Bible prophesied the first and second world war... humans landing on the moon and... the death of a Saint and Pope before the end of the century. - Saint? - Lady Diana. - How about the Pope? - Mother Theresa. You mean the Bible was written by extra-terrestrials? Think, inside the universe, there are numerous solar systems. That means, some wise living things must exist too. Tell me the possibility of none? Guess. Zero, isn't that right? Moon, I can't help praising you! Being the Chairlady of the HK UFO Association... you deserve the title so much. Listening to your speech is better than studying for ten years. What an exaggeration! Three years, I reckon. I have many things to ask about UFOs. Well, tidy up first... and then come to my home to continue the discussion, OK? OK. Why not come to my place. I have many wonderful things to show you. - All right. - Now... the most proper thing to study is... flying objects which fly in an S shape and irregular shapes. Won-hoi, I am going home now. How about me? You're the vice-chairman, you take care of things here. Long-hair, do you want to court Moon? No, we are going to study UFOs, that's all. Let's go. What a creep! He claims himself a Ufologist, but actually he intends to court girls. How do you know that? Of course I do! Actually I am like that too. If you are free, why not stay longer? I stay up late. I have a wonderful book. You know, the Chinese poet So Tung-pao saw a UFO once. He wrote a poem to commemorate the encounter. Anything to drink? Sure! Water or hot water? Anything will do. OK. How thirsty are you? I think you are very thirsty. I am the super... lustful... flying... erotic... alien from the Balutan Planet. I want to tell you two things. First, don't think that when a woman enjoys talking with you... it means she will go to bed with you. Second, my association is joined by... those who are really interested in studying UFOs. If you are aiming at courting girls, please go to Lan Kwai Fong. If I could court a girl in Lan Kwai Fong now... I wouldn't have followed you home. Sorry for bothering you. Of course you are. It's an alien from the Seven Sisters' Planet. A living thing from 400 light-years away. Impossible. I don't believe it. I am not going to Toronto. It's so cold and boring over there. Mom, I do want to visit you. But I have a lot of homework to do. My phone is going to be out of battery, let's stop here. Send my regards to Daddy and Grandma. Bye. We can go now. What? These are all you're buying? Why can't you buy me a pack of chocolate? Don't get angry, I am going to buy you chocolate right now. Kid, do you want to eat it? - Call me Daddy. - Daddy. - Call me beauty. - Beauty. Call me Tom Cruise. Tom Cruise. Call her Julia Roberts. You brat! How dare you dirty my expensive pants! Help, Daddy, help... Apologize now, otherwise I will throw you to the sea. What are you doing to my son? How did you teach you son? He wiped his snot on my pants. That's why you want to throw him into the sea, right? Well, what do you want now? What do you think? Let me tell you... Sorry... - Sorry... - Sorry... You will be parents one day. Don't be afraid. Don't worry, I'm with you. Are you a man? You know it very well. What's up? I am mad. Why? Because no one coaxes me. Coax you? Can you coax me? You look great today! You don't have acne. You have nice hair. Have you just washed your hair? I know, you're still mad about what happened on the ship. You know me very well, once I fight... I would kill. If I am jailed, you would become a widow. His son would become an orphan. It isn't worth it. Let's go in, it's cold here, come on. I don't mean that. Do you understand? I want a gentle, thoughtful, attentive and caring boyfriend. A man of fun! Fun? Christmas is approaching. Fun, right? How about my present? Merry Christmas. Where is it? It's fun! Romance. Christmas. Merry Christmas! Oh, no! It's gone! Are you serious? Let's stop searching. Of course not! It's very expensive. If you feel cold, you'd better go back. But you are holding the keys. Yeah. They dropped. I'll pick it up. Maybe the ring is down there too. I've almost got it... I've got it. Let's go. How come I can't it out of here? No kidding! Where are you going? - Just take your time. - All right, I'll try it again. Hello, are you Nancy? This is Carol. I am so mad! I just want to let off steam. All right, just go ahead. You stupid woman! I hate your prominent teeth, you are cheap, you are disgusting! I wonder, why don't you die now? You'd better go to hell. - Feeling better now? - Thank you. Who offended you? Who do you think? Your boyfriend? Why did you fight again? He doesn't dare fight with me, he's a dumb-bell, you know? He can't even speak fluently. All couples need to quarrel. It is a kind of communication. Hello? Nancy! Hello... Hello miss. We don't mean to hurt you but we just want to borrow your body. What? How? All couples need to quarrel. It is a kind of communication. - Hello? Nancy... - What? I had a nightmare just now. When? Just now. Are you fooling me? You had a nightmare while talking to me? Are you serious? What time is it now? 10:45 pm. I am watching TV. Bo, I've just met some spooky things! Don't panic, I am here with you. Don't panic. Don't panic. Nancy, help me please, I have a big problem. Why are you so careless? You'd better be safe? It's not that simple. Not simple? Bo seems to be conservative, doesn't he? - Stop it. - What is it? Pay for me please. Pregnancy test? Place it inside the urine for a second, then you'll see the result. If you are pregnant... the colour red will be shown in both holes. I have no guts to look, please take a look for me. How come there is moss? Don't worry, even if you are pregnant, abortions are a piece of cake. Don't worry. I'll find you a doctor, a trustable doctor. Nancy, you are my friend, right? So what? - Do it. - What's up? Hit me hard to get rid of it. You're insane! What's wrong with you? Do you want to save that kind of money? Ask your boyfriend to pay for you. It's not my boyfriend's baby. What a harlot! Listen to me first. Last night, I was abducted by a UFO. Those things... they mated with me. Those things mated with you, and they took turns? No, just one to one. I see, you were raped, but not gang raped. Are you fooling me? - I am serious! - See you. Trust me please. OK, I trust you, but please take your chest off me. I haven't. The three gorges on the Yangtze River! Beautiful scenery! The river floods! How come the moss juice is flowing out? Tighten your legs, don't let it flow out. I feel itchy, it hurts! - I am going to deliver... - What? I'll boil some water first. Do you know how to help my delivery? No! I want to make some tea to calm myself down, I'm not experienced at all. Stop fooling me please. You're ready to deliver? Call the ambulance. It's your boyfriend. You can't let him in. What will we do then? Do you understand? How can I explain to him? Carol doesn't want to see you, you'd better leave now. Why? What are you doing here? Get lost! She'll call you later. Carol, is that you? Give me your hand. One more... two more. - I can't take it. - Three more Impossible! It must be a dream. Hang on, don't deliver now... Don't be so sad. Take a look! So disgusting! I am leaving. - Don't leave me alone. - I am leaving. Nancy, I need you so much! Don't leave me alone. - No, please let me go. - It hurts! Open the door! Why don't you court a man instead? Open the door! What is it? You've laid an egg! You are lesbians, aren't you? Don't misunderstand! We weren't doing what you think we were doing. We are not lesbians. - Do you think I'm a fool? - No... Watch the video tape! Watch it and you'll know it. - You'll understand it. - You are insane! Go! - No! - Let's go now. He can't breathe! What are you doing? Let's run! Run! The Social Welfare people not here yet? They are on the way here. How about betting on horse number three? Be good, let me get you a drink, OK? Remember, this is not a rehearsal. You'll see the most horrible enemy you've ever met in your life. If everyone is ready, we'll leave. Sir, KK hasn't arrived yet. KK, why don't you get changed? Get changed! Change for him. In this mission, we have three targets. Chiu-chow Tung is one of the most wanted criminals. They are well armed. If they counter attack, kill with no hesitation. Understand? Yes sir. - Understand? - Yes sir. KK must be not in the mood. Look! He is grouchy! Go! Don't move! - Don't try to be funny. - Freeze! - Everyone on the floor! - Drop the gun! If you have guts, just shoot! Don't try to be funny. SDU is no big deal! I'll blow your head off. SDU is no big deal! I'll blow your heads off! Freeze! Have you had enough fun, Boss? Don't shoot! I have hostage with me. This is my demand! I want ten million US dollars, two blondes, and a ticket to Hawaii. If you don't meet my demand, I'll shoot him to death! I want ten million US dollars! Do you hear me? Sir, KK was found unconscious inside the changing room. Get KK. Don't get smart with me. Who are you? What's your name? - PK! (Curse you!) - PK. - Trying to be funny? - Don't, sir - I'll beat you... - Calm down... - I'll beat you so bad! - Calm down... - Let go... It's none of your business - Calm down... I'll beat you so bad! - I'll beat you... - Separate them... Help... Let's go! You are so nice! Why don't you carry the money for me? I am hurt... It hurts... Help me. Boss... You're my benefactor! My buddy! Although you are weird looking, you are a righteous man! I, Chiu-chow Tung, appreciate you so much. May I know your name? What's your name? PK. Good! PK. Give him $500,000. Yes, boss. A small token of my appreciation. I am going to be a fugitive. We will meet if there is a chance! - Bald Cheung. - Yes, Boss. - What can I do for you? - Take care of PK... offer him anything he needs. Give... Give 500 to Bald Cheung. Boss, it's so generous of you. Let's go. I'll give you two thousand, say goodbye to Boss. Goodbye Boss. - Goodbye... - Goodbye... Goodbye - Come back as soon as possible. - Come back as soon as possible. Your look will attract a lot of attention. Change it. I am too happy tonight! Come and drink some beer with me. You don't deserve such cheap stuff. I'll take you to eat shark-fins soup and abalone, like it? Brother PK, where do you come from? PK. PK? Oh, Peking! That's Beijing! You are Chinese, I see! Sorry! No more, stop searching please. I feel itchy... Mommy. Why did you bring me here? I watched TV this morning... and learnt that the chairlady of the UFO Association always comes here. - So what? - Tell her your story. Ask her to find out about the rapist for you. I won't tell others about such a disgusting thing. If you don't want to tell, just come to listen! You shouldn't let him get away. In fact, aliens have always contacted the people on Earth. How do they do that? First, it is called contact. You can see them, touch them and talk to them. Well... how about sexual contact? It's included. Another kind of contact is called channeling. Some people have a special kind of spiritual power. They are chosen by the aliens. Just like a radio. Once they've tuned in, they can receive message from the universe. It's similar to what the Chinese called possession. Won-hoi always receives those kinds of messages. He is the radio of our association. Another kind is called abduction. People are kidnapped to the space ship for a ride. They will kidnap people to another space or their space ship. To study and analyse human beings. I think you are interested in UFOs. Well, this is my friend Carol. She has had contact with aliens. No, it's none of my business, don't listen to her. Since you're here, just tell us your story. Dear fellows, we have a new case here. Just tell them everything. If you don't, I'll kill you! I'll tell them for you. All right. I'll tell them. This is the story of my friend. She was kidnapped by the aliens to their space ship. And she was raped. She got pregnant and had the baby. And then... She just told me all this. I see, you've been raped by aliens. When did it happen? How long did they mate with you? Do you know where they came from? Not me! Young lady. It's not necessary to deny it. Being raped by aliens is nothing special. Every month, Nelson takes me up and mates with me a few times. No big deal. By the way, Nelson hasn't come to me this month. Nelson just called me, and he said he would come later. Thank you. Let me introduce you, this is our senior member, Granny Lone. Where is the baby now? I dumped it. What? That's your son! He is so awful! He has two antennae! He seems to be mentally retarded. This isn't the point. If you have a mentally retarded baby, would you dump him too? A mother shouldn't be that irresponsible. I've told you not to tell them anything. Take it easy. You are so young, and they came so suddenly, we all know that it's not an easy thing to handle. Young lady, when you are older, you'll understand how great a mother is. I am always that straight forward, I am sorry. Actually what you said is true. Let me treat you to a drink, see whether we can help you or not. Nelson called me. He wanted you to wait for him outside. When I dumped the baby, I left a glove. It's cute! Carol, I've followed you for one whole day. I struggled for half an hour outside. Please don't avoid me! Let's have a good talk. You're so stupid! Why do you insist that I am a lesbian? If not, why are you so stealthy? It's really hard to explain. Well, let me explain to him, OK? He won't understand. Your girlfriend was kidnapped onto a space ship and was raped. Later she delivered a baby. But she dumped it. I know it's hard to believe. OK! In fact, just tell me the story, I would believe anything. In fact, I don't care whether this is true or not. I don't mind whether there is an alien or not. The most important thing is, you are going to stay with me, right? Although it's mushy, you are a nice guy. Come on, take a seat and talk. We are not lesbians. I trust you! Nancy would never be a lesbian. If you want to know something about channeling, let me tune your channel now. How? I don't know how! Two ways, wet or dry. How about trying the wet way first? Great! You said, there are aliens on Earth, I don't quite believe it. But you have to believe it. Brother PK, we are a family, let's play for fun with low stakes. This is Bony, this is my girlfriend, Miu Miu. 1000 and 2000 for a point, unlimited points per hand, okay with you? PK doesn't play well. Well, let's start now... Brother PK, this is so nice. Come on, let's play. West. I met Jane's daughter some days ago. She is so impolite! She didn't nod to me. She didn't nod (North)? I see! What is the world coming to? That's outrageous! Winning? - I'll win. - Good. Brother PK, where are your tiles? I can't take so many tiles. And potato chips too? This game doesn't count, let's start another game. Why are you so selfish? - I want some too. - Eat it... Eat it. Bingo... - Bingo... - Eat! Eat... Eat it. You're crazy! I won't earn money by risking my life! Come on, it's all right Brother PK, you've come at the right time. Buy anything you like, this is your share. Carol, you are brave enough. If I were you, after being raped, I would have no guts to face the world. Thank you for your concern. Hands off me... Brother PK, please give me face. No, I wasted a week to make her my girl. Mom... Mom... Mom... It's fine! What should we do now? Just take it easy. He's gone. Mom... Mom... Mom... An insane guy is up there! Mom... Crazy! Pal, I am driving, you know? No... Mom... Are you all right? Why are you crying? What's your name? My name is Moon. Moon? Can I touch you? I've seen an ET! It must be a dream! Go in... Friend. Sit down please. Sit. Sit. Sit. Daddy. Moon... Moon... Friend. Moon... Moon... Friend. Friend! I'm sure he is a living being of Star X22 from the Seven Sisters' Planet. But he must be partially human. A mixed blood. What did you do with him last night? I just stood here and watched him. One night stand? I stood here and watched him, that's all. And did nothing else? What could I do? It's a rare chance to meet such a complete ET. You should study it thoroughly. Get me the tools. Moon, tell me the magnetic reading. None. It's burning! Let me ask you some simple questions. Where are you from? How did you get here? What motive do you have? He won't understand. Show him by body language. Where do you come from? How did you get here? What motive do you have? What do you think about the activities held by our association? He doesn't seem to understand our language. It's hard to communicate. - I've forgotten one thing. - What? I know channeling! Li-ma-chau-ko-ko, ko-ko... Li-ma-chau-ko-ko, ko-ko... Ko Ko... Moon, nice to meet you. My name is PK. PK, this is the welcome dinner for you. Make yourself at home. Can you tell me how you linked with Won-hoi? We can't link up at all. But I'm using my supreme intelligence to express myself through the mouth of this ugly and arrogant scum. In fact, my intelligence is 100 times higher than human beings. But in such a short time... I can't adapt to your form of speaking and thinking. Wait. Can you tell me something about you? I came from Star X22 of the Seven Sisters' Planet. My main task is to study the living habits of people on Earth. Amazing! Nonsense! I am Superman! I am ET from Balutan Planet. Miss, why don't you interview me? What the hell is it? What do you think you are doing here? What a spooky look! You let a man suck your finger to talk. Do you think you are a kid? What are you laughing at, idiot? What did you just say? I'm sorry... don't blame him, he was just kidding. I won't, just because of you. PK, be careful of what you say, otherwise you will get punched... I'm speaking through his mouth, so he is the one who will get punched... You are peeing! I hate that scum, so I just peed on him. What do you want? Pal, I just wanted to pee on you, that's all. Not satisfied? Beat me, come on. Is that the best you can do? Why don't you give me a big punch? Where do you want to go after they are done with him? Mom. You want to go home so soon? Mom. KK, are you sure this is the correct picture? Yes, I can't forget his face. I was scared and fainted. - Check out his nose. - He is really different. - He's cute. - Let me take a look. You're so rude to take off my hat. - Hello - Hello, Carol? Moon, it's you. Come and play mahjong with us. I don't know how to play mahjong. How about cards? No? I have a Prada handbag selling at twenty percent discount. That's great! I'll be right there. Let's go. - Where is the Prada handbag? - Where is Carol? Never you mind. Where is the Prada handbag? - Hello? - Carol? Come up, I am on the fifth floor. All right. - Carol. - Hello. What are you doing? Hands off! What do you want? Just leave my girlfriend alone. Moon, what's happened? Carol, you're really lucky! What? I've found your son. Mom. Mom. Won-hoi has linked with your son, he can speak for him. Your son is called PK. Son, how are you? Mom misses you. It's getting cold, don't forget to wear enough clothes. Come to have lunch with me if you are free. Let's go... What's wrong with you? Aren't you acknowledging your son? I have acknowledged. Do you want me to take him home? To feed him and to bath him? Why are you staring at me? I didn't want to give birth to him. It's not my fault. How can I accept the fact that he is my son! You're stiff-necked, why don't you understand? It's not you who decides if you have a baby or not. It's predestined by God. You know, you're lucky indeed. You can have that close contact with an ET. I wish I were you. Since it's fate, just take it easy. Since you are predestined to be his mom, you can never deny the truth. Sorry, if I want a baby, I am sure I can have a better looking one. He is like monster. Let's go. You've gone too far! How can you claim your son is a monster? You gave birth to him. So what do you think you are? - Monster's mother. - Calm down. - She is too much! - Pal, would you behave yourself? You are old enough to take care of yourself, isn't that right? Don't go. Don't stop me! Mom, do you want to dump me? Mom, I know you must be scared. You are afraid of me. I know you don't want me. PK is a good boy. I don't want Mom to be scared. I don't want Mom to get angry. Thank you for giving birth to me. Mom. Mom. Mom... Family reunion at last! What the hell is this? Space Paparazzi. Brain Washing Flash Gun? Are you looking for this? Close your eyes. Police station? I want to report a case. - Where are we? - What are we doing here? - I don't know. - Burglary Get ready to spend your life in jail. What should we do now? We always want to contact the aliens. Now we have finally met one, and we are good friends now. So, we have to enjoy the great time with him. Are you ready? Can you eat that much? After knowing such a special friend like you... barbecuing will be so much fun for us! You can eat this now. Please put some on it, it's going to be overdone. Please. Brother PK, have you been eating glass since birth? But why aren't you transparent? He is used to living on another planet, of course he'll be different. Son. Son. Son. Your mom wants you. Please give me some honey. I want some too. It's great. What's wrong with you? This is nice! Eat this first. Look what is he doing! Let's sing the song of our association. Twinkle twinkle little star, how I wonder where you are. Up above the world so high, Like a diamond in the sky. - Let's dance - Twinkle twinkle little star. - Come on - How I wonder where you are. Twinkle twinkle little star. Son, you are all wet, be careful not to catch a cold. You just care about your son. PK. Don't just care about your son. Take care of me please. Kids will easily have nightmare if they play too much. If he doesn't want to sleep, will you take care of him? He is my son too. Can I ignore him? No more dancing, I'm tired What are you doing? Do you have bandage here? Are you all right? You're all right now! Come on, I have a corn, please get rid of it. Treat my back bone, I hurt it during a fight. Come on, right here! - Can you fix my tooth? - I want to be taller, help me. Don't you take advantage of him, okay? PK, they want to take advantage of you. No! No! - No! No! - Son, I feel so tired... come and massage my back please. You're taking advantage of me, no, no! Why do you help others instead? Who gave birth to you? You brat! You have no manners at all! I giving birth to you! - Mom... - Stay away from me, get lost. - Mom... - Get lost. You broke my heart, I don't want you. Why are you puckering up your lips? Stop it! Stop it! Stop crying! You little devil! Put your hand out. I want to teach you a lesson! Slap your own mouth! Come on! Slap your own mouth! Look at your uncles and aunties! Give me some honey please... Shame on you! I'm not taking care of you anymore. I'll let you be eaten by crows. Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! PK, cheer up! Why not dance with Moon? When will the full moon come? - Dance? - May I ask the heaven? What time is it now... in the Moon Palace? I would like the wind to take me there... but I am afraid that... it's cold in the moon palace. So dancing here on Earth... would make no difference! The moon shines... on the sleepless person. It reminds me of my family... distant from me. Life is filled with... both happiness and sadness. Just like the moon. Differs in shape from time to time. Hope you would share the moon... from afar with me, forever. Except taking planes and elevators... I haven't risen that high. Thank you, PK. May I kiss you? Help! PK is in trouble. Son, are you all right? Don't scare me! What are you doing here? I want to do the artificial breathing for him. He can breathe! Seems like he wants to talk. Won-hoi. Yes. I can't tune to the correct channel. Will he be hungry? OK, I will buy some dim-sum from the convenient store. - How can you be a father like this? - What's wrong? Don't you know his favourite? Glass! Yes. Feed him. My little baby. Come and eat glass! Little baby, come and eat glass. My God! He can't eat! How about this? Moon, PK go home. Daddy is coming for me. I have to go home. 00:00:01, January first, 1998? Top of Tai Mo Mountain. That is approximately two days later. Son, I don't know when I can see you again. So I bought you some new underwear. It fits you. And a coat, when it's cold, do remember to wear it. - Thank you. - And the ginseng. When you have a sore throat... - Soak in hot water and drink. - Thank you. This bear has been with me for a long time. Take this with you. When you fear darkness, hug him and sleep. - Thank you. - Be a good boy, OK? Yes, Mom. Thank you. As your step father, I didn't buy any present for you. I just have a red packet for you, keep it properly. It's a lucky charm. Thank you. You are leaving all of a sudden. - This is newly bought. - Thank you. But I love this so much, I'd keep it. Here is a pack of gum. When your space ship lands, your ears will feel pain. Chew it, it helps. Thank you. Don't touch. Thank you. I got it from Thailand, bon voyage. I have nothing to give you. But I have a song for you. Smooth, smooth, smooth like oil. It's as lovely as the egg tart. I would love to kiss your lovely face! Thank you. This is for you. I am so happy to have a friend like you. I would love to kiss your lovely face! - What's wrong? - Help! Don't scare us! His antenna is right here. Let him go! Someone is coming to arrest us. Go... Go! Over there! Hands on your head! Squat! Squat! No! Son... Record it for future use. PK! Son, how are you? Stop! Stop the experiment. Move the ET away. - PK!... - Moon... - What are you doing? Let him go... - Moon... Moon... Moon... PK... Let's move to plan B. Let me in! No! We are just doing scientific research, we don't mean any harm. But you know too much. I wanna kill you! Scientist? - Go home and cut your frog! - Son! If you go out like this, they will kill you! No! It's not necessary to die like this. What should we do? Let's go. What are you doing? Sir, these people have been brain washed. Now, I am taking them to the research centre. Follow me, this way. Turn right. That's my son. Help! It hurts! No! It really hurts. Be careful! - Drive to Tai Mo Mountain. - Now? Daddy ET is coming for his son. If we return him this antenna... What's this? This is funny. Well, it's your son! His flesh is gone, just this is left. Well, just this? Do you know what a star war is? Not really. It's better than nothing, right? How come you could escape? Cut the crap, where is my son? How about the rest? Sorry, I dropped the rest What? You dropped my son on the road? What's wrong with you? I told you to take care of him. Come on! It was out of our control. Return my son to me! Stay calm. It's helpless to lose your mind like this! Brother Bo. Do you have a solution? I am thinking. I read a book, it says that the ET has a self-reformation system. So, what should we do now? Does this method work? Do you have any other method? Sorry. Let's concentrate and think of PK. Try to re-form PK. I don't think this is effective. Well, let's increase our power. Stop playing. Come on! Stop playing. I don't mean to play. But they've come. Please don't resist. Return the ET's body to us for scientific study. Don't come near. You want this antenna? Your gun is no big deal. You think you're the masked superman? I don't give a darn! Stay where you are! I'll do things you can never imagine. It's already twelve o'clock, PK's daddy should be here. This is the only thing left of PK. I am sorry! I told you that he has a self-reformation system. That's right! - My son. - Mom. Daddy. Ladies and gentlemen, our planet has a history of 2000 billion light-years. 100 thousand light-years ago the number of living things went down. Finally, our planet exploded. I travelled in my space ship and wandered the Galaxy. And then I found planet Earth. Our planet was so strong and scientifically advanced... but it vanished in the end. However, the Earth still exists! At last, I know the reason why. Because, human beings have one thing which we were lacking. And this thing is called... love. Our people didn't know how to care for others. They didn't know how to be considerate. PK and I will rebuild our planet with love. Uncle, would you be considerate? Please let PK stay here with us. Please let PK stay. Though the Earth is beautiful, pollution problems are getting worse. If PK stays, he won't live long. PK. I can't imagine that I'd link up with this scum for such a long time. You... Son of a gun. My buddy! Buddy! Bye. Bye. Do you want to talk again? If you want to be my dad, be nicer to my mom. - My dear son, be a good boy. - Mom. This is for you. - Mom. Bye. - Bye. Moon Bye. Bye. Bye. PK. From the information you've seen, UFOs do exist on Earth. People don't believe it, because they haven't seen it. In a small town in Mexico, everyone saw UFO and ETs. If you lived there and you said you didn't see any, you'd be laughed at. Being the chairlady of the UFO Association, have you seen any ETs? What a pity. I haven't. But I believe that the experience... would be a beautiful, romantic and unforgettable one. In fact, I really wanted to tell her that... I did experience a beautiful,. romantic and unforgettable encounter. On that night, I wasn't brain-washed. When I kissed PK, I closed my eyes. Mom, don't send me the red packet. I will get it by myself. Yes, I've booked the tickets... and planned to visit you with Bo during Chinese New Year. Please send my regards to Daddy, Brother and Sister-in-law. Bye. Have we met before? Hello, my name is Moon. Bye. I'm sorry. Sorry! Sorry! Why did you take that from me? Help...
