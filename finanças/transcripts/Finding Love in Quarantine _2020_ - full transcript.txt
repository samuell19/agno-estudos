The year is 2020. This is planet earth. We're all in a fishbowl. Kind of like this guy only, there's a whole lot less room to move around. We walk fast, we live fast. Things are always in super speed, travel, commute to work, the list goes on and on. And then one day, suddenly we take a big break, a human stop if you will. And this is that moment. So where am I going today? Gracie, have you seen my phone? I need to talk to you about this. Wait, were you talking to me? Yeah, I was talking to you. I just queued up, they'll IP ban me if I quit! Okay, I'm not understanding a word you just said. Dad, can you come back later? Gracie, I'm your father, I don't have to schedule an appointment to talk with you, okay. Look, I just got your progress report, it says that your grades are tanking and you've missed math like four times - in the last quarter. - I was sick, remember? You need a buckle down kid, okay? You have an end of the year test in less than a month. Please. Okay. Dad, I'm not a kid. So not a kid. My name is Rick Baldwin. Well, I think we've made real progress there. I'm 45, a single dad, and I'm still learning how to do this whole thing. You know, life living it, trying to be a good dad, a girl dad, if you will. The thing is, I don't know what I would do without my little girl. It may sound cliche, but she really is my rock. She is my reason for doing what I do every day. Time, it's this idea that we have so much of it and that we can do things inside of it, with it. My daughter, Gracie, she gets up, makes her breakfast, day in, day out, goes to school, studies for class, goes to the dance camp. And then I sell, make calls, repeat calls, build my clientele. Back and forth I go, back and forth Gracie goes. We both get into our days and it begins to repeat itself. Suddenly time is somewhere between standing still and going by so fast that I don't know what happened to the last three years. My daughter and I are so similar, we share so many hobbies, but yet we are so busy or so preoccupied that we don't even notice that we forgot to spend time together. She goes left, I go right. She goes up, I go down, and the cycle repeats. When did we lose perspective? How can we stop time and remember to start new memories with each other? Bills, swipe more bills, make money, pay bills. We get into a routine and it takes us away from the things that we should be doing. California, Ohio, Montana, New York, the list goes on and on and on as I pack a suit, a new suit, another old suit, on my way to just doing my job. Well, so it's ironic, because today something different is going to happen. Time is gonna slow down, and in just an instant, we may get our wish. We may get more time. Virus spread all over Europe. Shutdowns, quarantine. Goodness, the stock market plummets to... Oh, San Francisco. I never really liked that purse. Well, you said it was your favorite. You gave it to me as a birthday gift, what was I supposed to say? I don't know, maybe the truth. And what kind of example would that set for our daughter? Gracie is doing fine. She's like any other kid her age, you know, going through the changes. You just gotta let her be. She's gonna grow up to be an amazing woman. I'm dealing with it. Best that I know how. You gotta stop being so hard on yourself, Rick. You're doing great. I just miss you so much. I know it's been three years, I just don't know if I can do this without you. You can. You just have to let yourself be. I don't know how. Don't waste your days wishing for the past to change. There is no promise for tomorrow. Today is your best day, Rick. Today is your best day. Hey. Hello? I gotta fly out today, I'll be back tomorrow. Okay. Yeah. Who's coming over? I texted Miss Audrey. She should be here when you get home from school. Cool. Hey, when I get back, we should do something. Do something? Yeah, you know, together. Like what? I don't know, whatever dads and daughters do. I'll Google it. Okay. Good. Do I even wanna know what kind of music you're listening to? Probably not. Uh-huh. I think that's my Uber guy. Alright honey, be good for Miss Audrey, okay? Hello. Oh, hi Steve. Hey Rick, hold up. Don't get on that flight to San Fran, it might be dangerous. Wait, what? Are you watching TV? Turn it on. - Turn on your TV right now. - Okay, hold on. We are receiving reports of what is being called an unprecedented global effort to shut down streets across nations, - within cities - Oh. And all non-essential storefronts. You see that? It's a global pandemic Rick. Families are asked, if not more so urged, - to stay - I don't understand. California Governor Thomas Haley declared a statewide shelter at home order effective immediately, with all but essential functions to be shut down. This is serious, and it's going all over the world, Rick. I'm watching it right now. I guess we just have to ride it out. State models that predict millions of potential infections in the next eight weeks. Okay, bye. What's going on? Well, you know how people have been talking about the flu lately? Kind of. I guess the doctors told the government that they need to stay home for a little while so they don't get sick. So can Emma come over? I don't think so. I think she needs to stay in her home too. What about dance camp? Reporting on assignment, here- - We'll see baby. We'll see. The trouble with mankind is we think we have time. We kill time, we save time, we make it and we lose it. Some believe we have all the time in the world, but not one of us is powerful enough to stop the march of time or slow it down. You can't keep time but you can spend it. Be careful though, because even free time is priceless. Once it's lost, you can never get it back. ♪ I don't know what day that I woke up in ♪ ♪ Tossing and turning into a spin ♪ - ♪ Yeah ♪ - Tuesday. - ♪ My world's upside down ♪ - Today is Tuesday. Thursday, Friday, today's Friday. ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ I need out of the town ♪ Can you believe it, Denton? 21 years and our love is as strong as ever. I got one month to figure out what to get her. She's the love of my life. She makes it all worth doing. I've always told her, if you ever divorce me, I'm going with you. I think you should get her a gift card. Yeah, nothing screams, "I love you babe." more than a prepaid gift card. Not a bad idea. I'll give that some thought. And of course she always wanted to go to Italy, but that's way down the line. I gotta figure out what to get her now. A Best Buy gift card, you know? So she can get like a surround sound system for the television in the living room. Yeah. Yeah. Nothing says I love you honey more than a gift card for a surround system for the living room. I couldn't agree more. It's a good call. Another day, another suspect. Keep an eye out on that one, Denton. Suspicious behavior indeed. Look at those slippers. Hey, you should get up now. What time is it? Daytime. Are you gonna answer that? I'm waiting for it to stop ringing so I can text her and find out what she wants. That doesn't make any sense. It's the way normal people do things, Dad. Yeah, well, none of this is normal honey. Why can't I go over to my friend's house? We've been through this. Emily's parents let her go out. Yeah? Well, Emily's parents don't love her as much as I love you. What's going on with school? Aren't you supposed to be doing something? They're teaching online now. Well then why are you here and not online? They're not taking attendance or anything. That's not the point. You still have to study for end of the year test, babe. Look, what do we got here going on? All right, what are you studying in math? Geometry. Measuring right, acute, and obtuse angles. Find perimeter of a rhombus. Yeah, you should probably get on that right now. "Give Steve a call, need to talk strategy. "Economy is looking bleak." Baby, I gotta call work. Hey Rick, listen, times are gonna get hard. "We're doing the best we can" is a phrase for losers. Most of the economy is shutting down, so not much point in teaching companies to increase sales when nobody's buying. Look, I know Steve, it's just, no one knows what's going on or when this is gonna end. I mean, just level with me, am I gonna have a job when this thing is all, when it all blows over? We're doing the best we can. Is there something that I could do from home? What if I go to their houses? I mean, what do they call that? It's like a blog cast. You know, when they, I don't know, with the video thing. Are you talking about a vlog? I guess. My kid says that's how normal people do it these days. Oh, kids today. If you email me the client list, I'll send out the invites for the internet seminar. Be innovative! What? An online sales course? Have you lost your mind? Just give me a chance, okay. My job, it means everything to me. That's pretty much all that I have left. Wait, wait. I have an absolutely great idea. A webinar video bringing our team to your front door! Thank you. I really appreciate this, thank you. Write it up and print the money! Hey. I need your help with... Where are you going? I'm going to spend the night at Emily's. Honey, you know you can't do that. Who cares anymore? Honey, it's important that you- - Your job is the only important thing, I heard you say it! Okay. You know what, I'm sorry. You know that that's not what I meant. Come here. Gracie, come here, honey. Come on. Sit down. Look, I know it's been hard since Mommy went to heaven, but it's important that you know, it's, it's you and me. We're a team. It doesn't feel like that. You're gone mostly, and when you're home, you just want to sleep. Yeah, I know. But that ends today. Things are gonna be different Gracie because, because you are the most important thing in my life. We're a family. Now I'm your Dad, well, you deserve to know what that looks like. What it feels like. Promise? Cross my heart. What did you need help with? I'm glad you asked. We're not done yet. We have to create your online account. Okay, great! Let's do it. Wow! How do you know how to do this? We did it! Ha-ha! How do I look? Handsome, but do you really need the headphones? Can I watch you vlog? Well, it is late and you and I have to get back on schedule. That means normal meal times, bedtimes, and we gotta keep this house straight. But the whole world is a mess. Maybe, but you and me, we're strong. The whole world may be separated, but as long as we stick together, we'll get through it. I love you, baby. You gotta go to bed. Fine. - Goodnight. - Hey, Love you. Love you! I still love you! Love you. Just walking at night like this, it's like donuts are romantic. ♪ Dance it ♪ ♪ Dance it ♪ ♪ Dance it ♪ ♪ Dance to the beat of- ♪ Okay, first of all, we are law enforcement officers, okay? Now you need to start taking this more seriously if you ever expect to be a real officer. Okay? Okay Rick Baldwin, you can do this. You just gotta be natural. Naturally. Yes, hello. My name is Rick Baldwin, from Productive Sales. And I just wanna say thank you for joining me over the next 30 minutes. My first online sales seminar, webinar. Are you familiar with the wonderful world of Holly Pockets? Do you know how expensive Holly Pockets are? For instance, last year in their Christmas catalog, they sold a doll house for $299. Sometimes I think, I feel like my house barely cost that much, but it's what my daughter wanted. Even though I tried to talk her out of it. I called the company, and the operator picks up and she says, "I'm sorry sir, but we no longer "sell that dollhouse for $299." And I thought to myself, "I knew it. "No one in their right mind is gonna buy "a doll house for $299." And she says, "But sir, we do now offer "a new doll house for the low price of $399." You see whether a customer says yes or no, and how much they're willing to spend and on what, really isn't about our decision. It may surprise you, if you allow yourself to just get out of the way of the process, at what the consumer will do. And yes, it's a hard thing to do as a salesperson. I mean, believe me, I know. Yes, of course, I did buy the dollhouse. I think Daddy is the first man that a little girl learns to wrap around her finger. And then when she grows up, she realizes, "Oh my goodness, I have nine others." It never really worked on her mother though. No. Moms, Moms are like kryptonite to a little girl's charms. She was just like her mother though. Strong, beautiful, a little scary. A man can never really know what's going on in a woman's head. I think he wins her heart, and then he just hopes that the rest will follow. Thanks for listening guys. I'll see you the night after next. Bye. Strength is not measured by what we can do, but by overcoming the things we once thought we couldn't. We live in frightening times, and the problem with scary things, is we aren't very good at reacting to them. We fear what we don't understand, and what we fear we seek to control, which is why many of us are panic buying at the grocery store. Don't let fear rule your daily living. Be guided by reason, responsibility, and don't let your fear go viral. This is how you'll find your strength. Okay, there was like 15 seconds left in the most important championship game of her young life. I'm only the greatest defensive player in all the world. She's looking like she's gonna do something. She turned, she looks to pass, throws him off! Oh my goodness! The shot clock is ticking away! She shoots! Sorry! Ugh! I mean, how many times? How many sports do they even play? You can't mess this up. Steaming broccoli, but I like to add a little bit of onion just to add that flavor. So, you can do it! Hang in there with me and I'll get you there. So basically, you wanna chop up your broccoli. Hey Rick, hey man. I'm learning how to steam veggies. Wait, what? I'm sorry, did you say steam or steep? Hey, could you lower that background TV? Hey Alexa, turn it down. Alexa, please, turn it down! Is that better? Much. What are you doing? I'm eating healthy is what I'm doing. Doing all my own stuff. I bought my own yard today. 'Cause the gardener didn't come to work 'cause of all this social distancing stuff. It's very serious, this virus. The pool guy didn't come either. I cleaned my own pool, I mowed my own yard. How's it going with the webinars? I'm seeing progress. I got it up and running. I just need clients now. You know how startups go. Yeah, I do. I think you're doing a great job. I'm very excited. Just be patient. I mean, we're starting a whole new educational program. I'm actually kind of excited about it. Maybe I won't have to travel so much in the future. I feel really, really good about my ideas. Thanks Steve. Show me what you got Rick. Hey, good luck with your vegetables. Hey Theresa. In here. Do we have any envelopes. Give me a second. What are you doing? Productive sales webinar. Hosted by nationally recognized sales consultant, Rick Baldwin. Who's he? He was supposed to be at that seminar I was supposed to go to in San Francisco, until everything hit the fan. Whatever. My company paid the registration fee, and now they're paying me to watch him. Well that's cool. There you go. Wait, you're not gonna watch it? Seriously? It's called working from home. Of course not. Really? Awe. Sorry, handsome, nationally recognized sales consultant, Rick Baldwin. Gotta say, I'm gonna give him props for the public speaking. What? He's not public speaking. He's sitting at a computer in his pajamas. I personally could never get up in front of a room full of people and speak. It's literally my biggest nightmare is public speaking. I even read somewhere once that some people's fear of public speaking is greater than their fear of death. Really? Yeah. So if you shot someone before they had to give a speech, you'd actually be helping them out? Perhaps. Yeah, I think that some people would rather die than look foolish, which in and of itself is foolish. What are you doing? Oh, Bobby sent me this rainbow. You remember my brother's second oldest? Got it. So we're supposed to put this rainbow in the window to help spread hope. Oh. I think it's important for kids to express themselves right now, especially with all the craziness and stress. So I am clipping art coupons to send to him. You spoil those kids. Well, you know, I only have three nieces and two nephews, and I consider it my privilege to be able To spoil each and every one of them. Yes, I know, I've heard it! Is it Groundhog day? Oh tape, I need tape. I think daddy is the first man that a little girl learns to wrap around her finger. And then when she grows up, she realizes, "Oh my goodness, I have nine others." It never works on her Mother though. No, Moms, Moms are like kryptonite on a little girl's charms. They're like- - What are you doing? I don't know, I just, you know, who is this guy? A man can never really know what's going on in a woman's head. To think, maybe you'll win her heart, and you just hope the rest follows? Married? I don't know. I can't tell. He does have a young daughter though. Well, that's it for me. What's with the elephants? Yeah. Yeah, he's a psycho. No, it's not what that means. Histories most nefarious men had an obsession with elephants. Hitler, Al Capone, my ex husband. Trust me. Rick Baldwin, I'll see you next time. I don't know, I just have the feeling it's just he and his daughter. Ugh, poor kid. Stuck at home alone with her dad all day? - Ugh. - I think it's sweet.

I haven't come up with a snappy name for this series yet. I know I should because branding. Well, branding is an important part of sales. And brand awareness is tonight's topic. It's important- - Theresa! - that your clients know who And what you really are, but sometimes it's hard to be transparent. You get used to wearing masks, especially now, with everything that's going on. I mean, I know this isn't anything that anyone ever wanted. If some good should come out of it, I'm hoping that this reveals our true selves. Who we really are. And if we don't like who we are, then we rise up, we meet the challenge, we become our best selves. I think a lot of masks are gonna come down. I know I for one am ready. Let's show people who we really are. This is our day. This is our moment. This is our moment to shine. I'm sorry, yeah, I got a little off track. I have time for questions, if anybody has one. Well okay, I'll be back tomorrow. Oh, we have one. Less of a question. More of a statement. "I'm really enjoying your positivity." Well thank you, thank you. I appreciate that you appreciate my sense of humor. Well, I guess that's all. I'll see you next time. It's a date. It's a date. Uh. It's a date. Did I just? Did I just send that? And you're busted. I'm totally busted. So what's up with the elephants? I'm thinking about changing things up now. Doing my vlog once a day. Do you have a lot of viewers? Well, it's still new. Tomorrow's my birthday. I know. Stop it with the donut Denton! And look for perpetrators! Where does this deep-seated hatred of donuts come from? You're not even a real cop. Attitude. I'll eat my donuts. Can't stop me. A cop that hates donuts, I never even heard of such a thing. When are you going to tell me what's going on? Well, it wouldn't be a surprise now, would it? Okay, I know you got cheated out of dance camp, and how badly you really wanted to go. There will be other dance camps. However, a girl only turns 10 one time in her life. What is all this? This is your birthday party. Here, put this on. You don't wanna be the only one not wearing one. Dad! Come on, it'll be great. Ta-da, look at that! Now what? Well, now, we wait until everyone gets here. Dad. What? Ta-da! You don't have to do this. Do what? Pretend that people- - Oh look! Right on time. Happy birthday Gracie! Happy birthday, we miss you! Hi guys! - Hi! - Happy birthday Gracie! Woo-hoo! Happy birthday kiddo! You're safe with us. Gracie, happy birthday Gracie! I can't believe you guys came! - Hi! - Happy birthday Gracie! Happy birthday! Hey! It's Steve. Listen, I just wanted to leave you a quick message to tell you I appreciate you and you know, you're one of the good ones. You're a certain man in uncertain times. I work with a lot of people. I work with some good ones besides you, don't worry. I'm the kind of guy that likes to eyeball people. You know, down the road, if you were here I would be eyeballing you. Man, I never even asked you about your hair and I've been touching your face man. Never asked you how you did it with, but that's how I would've done. I would've said "Hey, Rick." My highlights, 'cause I'm gonna get some highlights. I've been out in the sun a lot here. We are the dream team. Yup, I miss you. I miss you buddy! I feel something Denton. Something's going on. Need a Zyrtec? No, I mean something around the neighborhood is going on. I am gonna make a quick doughnut run. Denton, get back here! I need you to focus! Okay, okay, but can I get some donuts after? Denton, there's no time to take a break! We need to be searching for clues. Check everywhere. Leave no stone unturned. The community is depending on us. Wait, I think I've got something. Uh-huh. Oh, it's you. Good afternoon, Landa. What's good about it? It's just a figure of speech. Another basketball landed in my backyard, nearly almost cut the head off me this time. Gracie's working on her shot, I'm sorry. Oh, basketball, soccer, which one is it this time? There's 100 balls in my tree, Rick! I'll tell her to lower her aim. Again, I'm really sorry about that. Fine. I apologize. I'm a bit frustrated. Being stuck in, can't see my children, my grandchildren. And I just found out my Mahjong game has been canceled for the next 30 days. And to top it off, I have only half a roll of toilet paper left to my name. Ordered some a few weeks ago, but it turns out everybody's waiting for toilet paper! Yeah, well I'm right here and I wanna be a good neighbor, so you ever need anything you let us know, okay? Eh, fine, thanks, fine. Hope your little one's doing okay. I mean it must be hard for her and for you not having a woman in the house. Just thinking about it... Don't know how you're doing this. It's okay, we're we're making it though, but thank you. I appreciate that. Again, anything you need, you let me know, okay. And I'm gonna, I'm working on Gracie shots. It's gonna be, it's gonna be right there. So, again sorry, and just feel free to throw the balls over. Thank you. Life marches on. I think it's important that we stop and witness it. We have to stay connected even when we're keeping our distance. Yeah. Did your daughter have fun? Yeah, she was pretty surprised. I think she had a good time. Awe! Such a good dad. Thank you. I don't know that that was always the case. I'm trying to be better. It's just, well, been an adjustment since my wife passed. Theresa! Oh, I knew it, I knew it. I'm so sorry to hear that. That must be so difficult for you and your daughter. Theresa! Why are you yelling? He's a widower. - No. - Yeah. Yeah. Is that good or bad? Well, it depends. Ask him how she died. No, I'm not gonna ask him! I bet it has something to do with the elephants. So I noticed you like elephants. Subtle. You told me to do it. Gracie, that's my daughter, she paints them and hangs them all over our house. That's something Gracie started doing you know, after. They say art is, is very therapeutic. I hardly even notice 'em anymore. He's a keeper. I swear, I think I'm gonna cry. Dad. Hey honey, what's up? I just wanted to say thank you for today. Oh, you're welcome. Hey, we'll have your friends over for a real party when this is all over. What if that was the real party? What do you mean? What if this is never gonna be over? Oh, babe, look, this will be over. Maybe not as fast as we'd like, but someday soon there's some real smart people working around the clock. You'll see. I guess. I'm serious. It's not like this is the end of the world Apocalypse. We just have to stay inside and wash our hands and we'll stay safe. Then it will pass. And you know what? What? We'll come out better on the other side, you'll see. Okay. Okay. Plus, there's no zombies. What? If this was the end of the world, there'd be zombies. Oh yeah. I guess you have a point. Say goodnight, Gracie. Goodnight Gracie. I love ya, hun. I have Rick's - Hey, hey, Alexa, no! - Ready to play now. No, no, stop it. - Please, please. - The temperature is - 98 degrees, - Alexa. thank you for asking. I'm watching Rick's vlog- Yes, I hear you. - It's important, - Thank you. That your clients know who - and what you really are. - Thank you. Do you know who you are? He's pretty good. I know who I am. I think it's always important in business. You got a bright future ahead of you kid. Sure, playing. Come on. - I'm watching Rick's vlog! - Listen to Rick? I don't believe I have that track. Please, Alexa. Alexa, come on, Alexa! I'm sorry what are you asking? - I can't understand. - Alexa, Alexa! I definitely see a donkey right there. A donkey? He's in mid kick, mid-back kick. A donkey. I don't think I can get up. So Theresa, do people call you Terry for short? Huh? Oh! Of course, you think I'm Theresa, I forgot. No. My name is Amber. But you probably still think I look like Teresa. Oh. Oh, hi Amber. Wow, you don't look anything like your photo either. What do you mean? How, how would you know what I look like? Okay, what? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, don't leave! No, I have to go. I'll get back to you later. Really, it's okay. I love your, I love, they're great! Ahh. Hi. Oh! Ahh! Is it time yet? Yup. Come on, let's go say hello to everyone. Okay. And now. Come on. All right. It's gonna happen. Happen. Okay, any minute now. Wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait, come on! Oh my gosh. Look, look, look, look! Look at that. Oh my goodness. Are you seeing all of them? - Yeah. - They're amazing. You show me. Oh yeah. So I owe you an explanation. My roommate, I mean my housemate, we share a house together. We're college friends, and she's the one who logged into your sales webinar 'cause I'm not even in sales. I teach art in elementary school. An art teacher. I just enjoyed watching your talks and well, it never occurred to me that you'd think that I was someone else. Theresa, who is not me. So anyway, I'm Amber Russell. It's nice to meet you. Hi Amber Russell. I'm Rick Baldwin, would you like to go to dinner with me? These are defining times. While everyone is looking for a mask to wear, I think a whole lot of masks are about to come down, revealing what we're really made of. One thing that has become excruciatingly clear, is that we are all very literally in this together. Therefore we must fight together, live and love together, for that is how we persevere. Thanks a lot! Appreciate it! You're an unsung hero! Euclidean geometry is the branch of geometry that is focused on the study of two dimension solid geometry and planes. There's some examples which include basic facts, which is the interior angles of triangles equal to 180 degrees - and the shortest distance - Voila! Between point A and point B is a straight line. The subject known as - Euclidean geometry - Huh? Hey, how's your studying coming? Hard. Well, that's math, it's supposed to be hard. I guess. In a broader sense. When's your test? Tomorrow morning. Ee, yikes. I don't like doing school online. Well, I'm sure your teachers don't like teaching online either. Yeah, but they don't have to take a test in the morning. True. I'm thinking about going to bed early tonight. That's a very grownup decision. Yeah, well, a lot of things can happen when you're acquainted for six weeks. Yeah. Are you gonna eat your dinner? I'm gonna eat a little later. I have some stuff to take care of. Bon appetit. You hear that Denton? Something very, very, very peculiar is going on in this section of the neighborhood. I think we're onto something. I think it's pretty much a squirrel, to be honest. I mean, doing some really fickle things. Maybe chasing something. Its tail. Very well could be recruit, or it could be a burglar, or a weirdo, or even something worse, like- - Hey look. I think there's a wristwatch right there. Well grab it, it could be evidence, or better yet a clue. It's surrounded by poison Oak. So I don't- Go! I'm super allergic. I don't wanna do that. You're wearing gloves, grab it. Oh no, no, it's super cheap. It's super cheap. It's a really, it's a really cheap watch. I just solved the case. That's why, that's why they didn't go get it. They probably threw it away straight off. Let's beat it. I'm just saying. You don't want too cheap watch. No, open's always better. It's more cas. Okay, here we go. Oh, hey. Hey, sorry I'm late. Traffic was brutal. No, that's- Wait, what, traffic? Right. I love the place that you picked out, it's beautiful. Oh, thank you. Yeah, I love this place. I come here often. I see you ordered without me. Well, it's just my usual. What'd you get? Oh, it is a frozen meal of something. Hmm. To... Yes, to the two of us. The two of us. So have you always been a good cook? Actually I'm not. I'm a good reader though. This is from a recipe that I downloaded today. Are you being modest? No, really. You know, before the shutdown, I was a delivery and microwave kind of guy. I guess there's a lot of changes around here. A lot of change. Enough about me, tell me about you. What do you mean? You know so much about me already. You've seen me at my worst. It wasn't so bad. It was insane. Okay, what else do you wanna know? Tell me about you and Theresa. Oh, well Theresa was my college roommate, and I got my art degree and I went on to teach. She went on and got married, and then when it didn't work out with Jean, her husband she asked me to move in to help cover some of the expenses. So, now it's kind of like old times, but with better furniture. Yeah. What do you do for fun? For fun. I have three nieces and two nephews that I consider it a privilege to spoil. And I teach third through sixth grade art. So I've got another 200 kids that keep me busy. And then, well, I love movies, and music and reading and podcasts. Podcasts! There's a guy named Michael Hewitt, you would love his podcast. He's so upbeat and inspirational. And he actually, you remind me of him a little bit. You should check him out. I think I will. Thanks. If it's not too forward, I take it you've never been married? Mm-mm, but I was in a long relationship for a few years and it didn't work out. But like I said, three nieces, two nephews. They keep me pretty busy. It's getting kind of late actually. I should probably get going. You should You want me to call you a cab? You look like you could use a cab. I had fun tonight. I did too. Thank you for inviting me. Bye. The economic distress that has hindered Russia into all of these borders has begun to show the signs of a bending recession. That's strange. Who would be coming by? Is it even legal to come by? Hey Gracie, did you order delivery? Huh? Well, that explains where all our money went. How many of these things do we have? Thank you Mrs. Wilson! Hey Steve, no, it's going good. Yeah, it's slowly turning into something special. I've met some real fascinating people. Keep it up, Rick. Tell you what, you're making me so proud buddy. You are doing great. Now you should transition into a tree pose. Taking your right hand and grabbing your right- - Okay! Oh! Left leg. Now take your palms all the way up towards the sky, taking all the pungent energy. Ready? One, two. Hey, how'd it go? I got a D. Ah, I'm sorry honey. It was hard, huh? It was awful. This whole thing was awful. Yeah, well you'll have another test next week. You'll get another chance. I don't want any other chance. I wanna go outside and play with my friends. I know honey, soon. Come here. Come here, come sit by me. This'll all be over soon, okay? Theresa. What's wrong? It's Donnie. Is he being a jerk again? Yeah, kinda. Okay, well you know, he's constantly trying to get under your skin and you guys have been divorced for over- - He has it. Amber, he has the virus. Honey, I'm so sorry. Oh no. I have to go take care of him. I have to, he has no one else. No you don't. This is somebody who has made you miserable for years. Come on, Theresa. He's hurt you more than anyone else ever has. Yeah. That's why I have to go. "Sorry, can't make it tonight. "Theresa needs me." Okay. Come on Rick. Say something. Say something meaningful. Hey, I heard from Seattle yesterday. Yeah, you remember Mildred and her software team? They took you up to the conference? Yeah, of course. Yeah, they let us go. Wait- - So much for a handshake is as strong as Oak or whatever. You mean like the whole social distancing thing? What happened? I don't know. She said they were gonna focus in another direction. That's what she said, but it's a good thing we have those other clients you know. All these seminars you're doing, that's gonna work, and they're gonna stick in there and hang in there. I just want you to know that. He probably needs food. Okay, if I get a mask, I could hit the grocery store before I go to his house. Do we have anymore masks? How long are you gonna even be there for? Well they're saying 14 days and he should be out of the water. Have you even thought about like, if you get this from him? He'll be upstairs, I'll be downstairs. I'll make it work. I should bring cleaning stuff. Do we still have bleach? I don't... I just, I can't help but feel like you haven't thought this through Theresa! I mean, okay, I get that you were married for 11 years and you're feeling some sort of emotional responsibility, but is it worth risking your life for? We are out of bleach! I thought we had more bleach! Okay, all right. - It's gonna be okay. - Don't. It's gonna be okay. I can't explain it, I don't even understand it. Donnie is a jerk! A narcissistic egomaniac. Yes, this is true. When you spend a third of your life with someone, it's like, they're a part of you. He would do it for me. He would complain the whole time, but he would do it. Call me when you get there. Would you quiet down Denton? The whole purpose of us being stealth like is the catch would be perpetrators off guard, to ensure the neighborhood's security. You know, you are no fun at all, okay? You need to like, relax. Okay, first of all, we are law enforcement officers, okay? If you ever wanna make it to the big leagues, you need to start taking it seriously today. This isn't Disneyland, you know. We are here to serve and protect. In fact, why don't you say that with me? Serve and protect, go. It sounds so formal. To serve and protect. To serve and protect, very good. I get it. But you didn't need to make me feel bad. You didn't. My job is to get you ready for the big leagues. Don't take it personal, kid. Screw this screw, okay. Look, fine. Just do me a favor. Stop it with the sound effects and the flashing the light in my face. I'm tired of it. I don't even know what you're talking about. That's not me, it's the saber. Protect yourself. Yeah, so she is just gone. I don't know what to say. Yeah, she just picked up in the middle of a pandemic and moved back in with her ex, left me here by myself in her house to hold down the fort. And this is, this year has just been crazy. Surprises just keep coming. Well, I think maybe Theresa's ex-husband trusts her and Theresa trusts you. That's love, right? Yeah, I guess. I just have never had that kind of love. I don't know, maybe I never will. Why would you say that? Didn't you say that you were engaged once before? Yeah, but I never had the kind of pickup in the middle of the night, come take care of me in the middle of a pandemic kind of love. You shouldn't sell yourself short Amber. Look, I, I can't have children of my own, Rick. That's just sort of the way it is. When my fiance found out, he dumped me. That's terrible. It's just different for men. I don't expect you to understand. It's when women can't have children, they're just looked at as half a woman. Their society looks at us as broken, and all the promises of, I love you's forever, they just, they don't matter. I do understand. But the important thing for you to remember is you're not a broken woman. And if your ex really believed that, then he's the one with the problem, not you. I know that you mean well, because well, you're Mr. Positivity and all right? Amber, I'm just- - Yeah, I just, I better go. I just, I need to clear my head right now and it's just better if I go. Wait, are you really asking for space during a quarantine? Yeah, so goodnight. The subject known as Euclidean geometry was built on the basis of Euclid mathematical theories and postulates. Most notably composed and synthesized in his publication, "The Elements." In a broader sense, Euclidean geometry is also referred to the. Here you go, honey. You've gotten better at cooking. Thank you, Gracie. You know, I believe that if you, you put your mind to it, you can do anything. Was that another commercial for me to study math? I believe it might've been. Ah, hold on a second. Oh, I gotta take this. I'll be back in a sec. Okay. Stay with me Denton! We're very close! Something big's about to happen! And you don't think this is slightly overkill? No! You've got a lot to learn. What exactly did you think we were going to find on the ground? Look at that Denton. See that in the shadows? I think that's my car. It is your car. Can we like break for dinner soon though, right? Stick with the master. I don't know what's gonna happen, but I know something's gonna happen. You'll see. Hello. How's it going, Rick? How's your little Gracie? Actually, we are better than expected. That's real good. I'm glad. Yeah, this is hard, Rick, but things have been going as well for the company as I hoped, there's been a need to layoff so many folks. Even my assistant Stacy has had to go for now- - Yeah, but the government stimulus package. I mean, that's gotta help, right? Yeah, if it ever comes to us. Besides, how long is that gonna last? You know, you can't rely on bailouts forever. Just a small bandaid really. I see. You know, Rick, I'm sorry, 'cause I know you did your very best and you did your pivot and everything, but we just didn't get what we need to stay in business right now. Look, times are tough. I'll be fine. You know, we've been working together a long time man, and I am truly sorry friend. When it's over maybe we can evaluate if there still is a business. I would hope that you could come back. Let's just get through this and we can go from there. Listen, I'm sending you a three week pay package from today, if that could help. Thanks Steve. Oh, and Rick? Yeah? I'm truly sorry. Yeah, me too. Hey, but in the end, it's not how we start, it's how we finish, right? That's what my Dad used to tell me. Your Dad was a smart man. Yeah, one of the best. Smartest I've known. Hey, for what it's worth, I really have enjoyed your podcast. You're meant for this. Thanks Steve. Goodbye Rick. Goodbye Steve. Gracie? Gracie? Gracie? Gracie? Gracie? Gracie? Gracie? Gracie, this isn't funny. Gracie? Gracie. You have reached the County Sheriff's office, please do not hang up. Someone will be with you as soon as possible. Hey, how are you doing? I'm thinking about you. Oh, it's a little crazy over here. Yeah, I'll bet. How's Donny? Oh, he still has a high fever, shortness of breath. Oh Theresa, I'm sorry Hospital won't take him. They said he has to get worse first, and by then it might be too late. Well, that's crazy. What are you gonna do? Wait it out, hope for the best. What else can I do? I think I'm helping being here though. Well, of course you're helping by being there. You're in the right place. I'm really sorry about how I reacted last night. You're totally doing the right thing. 9-1-1, what is your emergency? My daughter is missing. I don't, I don't know. She's just, she's just gone. Her name is Gracie. How old is your daughter? I'm sorry, what? And when was- - 10. She just turned 10 a few weeks. When was the last time you saw Gracie? At dinner, I guess. Well, it was more like a late lunch. Look, I don't know. It was like six, seven hours ago. Shouldn't you be sending someone over? Mr. Baldwin, are you and your daughter practicing the shelter in place mandate? Yes, we're staying in the house. What is, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but what does this have to do with anything? You're both confined to the inside of your home and yet you say you haven't seen your daughter for the past seven hours? Look, I don't know what you're implying, but I am a good father. I'm a good father. I don't know what you're implying, but I'm a good father. Just find my daughter, please. Please just find my daughter. Thank you. Daddy, I missed you so much! Oh baby! Where were you honey? You worried me so much baby. You okay? Ah, officers, I don't even know what to say. I'm so sorry. Looks like we find your daughter right in time. Right before she could get into any real trouble. Yeah, we saw her run through the neighbor's backyard and apprehended her and brought her home. Would you sit on the couch for a minute? I'll be with you in a second, okay honey. I'm sorry to have bothered you guys. I know you have a lot more important things going on than this. Say it to this man, 'cause he's the one who spotted her. He's very vigilant. He's the hero here. Ah. Serve and protect, that's what we do. Have a goodnight sir. Thank you for your service officer. No bother at all. If you need us again, we're red unmarked car right around the corner. On the other side of the street. Gracie Anne Baldwin. You scared me half to death. What were you thinking? Trying to help. Help? How? By disappearing in the middle of a global pandemic and stealing vegetables from Mrs. Wilson's garden? I mean, what's gotten into you? Since you don't have work anymore, I thought we may need to eat it. This is because of my job? I didn't want you to worry about not having enough money to buy food. Oh honey. Okay look, we're gonna be fine. I'm not worried and you shouldn't be either. And even if I was, stealing cucumbers is not the answer. I like how things are now. What do you mean? I don't want it to be like when you were always sad and busy. It's never gonna be like that again, I promise. We're a team, and no matter what happens, whatever challenges come our way, we're gonna face them together, okay? I get scared sometimes. Yeah, me too. But you know what I've learned, is that no amount of fear and worry in this world is gonna make things better. Not one bit. I just need you to know that you and me, we're okay. That's what matters most. And I'm not messing this up. And everything else, I'll deal with it as it comes. What about your job? Including my job. But for now, I think we're gonna have to take this vegetables back to Mrs. Wilson. She won't even know they're gone. I don't think she sees too well. Well maybe so, but... Actually I think you might be right. I love you honey. I love you kiddo. You had me so scared. Things are gonna be okay. Hi Rick. I feel like I wanna explain about the other night. I owe you an apology. I mean I just, I'd like to explain myself. Basically why, you know, that I should apologize. So maybe I should say apologize 14 more times. How about that? Okay. Hey Rick, it's Amber and... Duh, he knows who you are. Hey Ricky... What is he, six years old? It's a. Hey Rick, how are you? Hello. Hey Rick. No! Okay, got it, got it, got it. Got it, got it, got it. You're not gonna believe this Steve. It was from Rick's webinars. Oh wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa. what are you talking about? We have sponsors? Yes, and they sent all these checks! How did I not know about this? He must not know. Does Rick know? Does he know? Steve, the post was delayed! No one knew about these checks. Okay, okay. All right, I gotta get off the phone. - I gotta figure this out. - Steve, Steve. - Okay, bye, bye. - Okay. Oh my gosh. Okay, checks, checks like real checks. Checks like, real like checks. How did he do that? I should probably give Rick a check. That's what I should do, and let him figure it all out. I'll give him a check and then he'll tell me what to do about the other checks. Okay. That's what we're gonna do. 13 seconds left in the championship game. You may remember Rick Baldwin as the one who got away. The Lakers sure do. That's because of contract disputes, they couldn't settle, he goes! He's up, he's in! He gets one more shot! Three, two, one! That's you Rick? Hi Landa! Come closer to the fence. Did you get what I left on your doorstep? I did, thank you. Did you see what I left you? I did, thank you. Can't thank you enough, actually. So how you doing? You know, with this whole quarantine thing and all. Ah, I lost my job Landa. Oh, that's terrible. Ah, it's actually kind of a blessing. I started a new adventure, kind of a self-employed thing. Oh, oh that's good dear. I hear that the strong always find a way to survive. You must be very proud of yourself. I don't really think of it that way, but thank you. So is there a special lady in your life? It's been a long time since I had those feelings. Like I could open my heart up. But with this new job, I met someone special. I don't know, I feel like my heart is opening up again. Well, women love a strong man, and you're a strong man, and you're a good Dad too. You know what, go for it. Take a risk. You know, you might even find love in quarantine. Finding love in quarantine. That's not bad. Oh, can I get my ball back? I'm keeping your ball. Probably better you keep it. Hey Rick, I've been thinking, I mean I've been isolating long before this all even happened. I've been emotionally holding back, keeping people at arms length, wasn't even protecting myself. I was doing myself more harm, actually. Chloe decided to wake up Barry into the fire crawl. "Ouch, that hurt", screamed Barry. And I wanna do something crazy too! The elementary art school teacher who wants to have a wild side. And another thing, Rick, subconsciously or not I think your daughter needs to feel like she's part of something bigger. Like she's not alone. Because the most important thing I've learned from being alone, is that we're not meant to do this alone. Well, I figured out what I wanna do Denton. That's great Rogers. A man needs purpose in life. You know, and you're old enough, and you know, you've taken long enough to decide what you wanna do. I'm talking about Harriet. Oh. Our anniversary gift. Yeah, no, I knew that. I knew that. I know what you meant. I'm taking her to Rome. I actually have family in Georgia. That's Italy, Denton. Okay, well that's far away. That's far away. You're gonna take a plane, you're gonna fly there. Yeah, it's Europe. What about me? What about you? What am I gonna do when you're gone? It's not forever kid. I'll just be gone two or three weeks tops. Well fine, just give me a heads up so, you know, I can plan a trip around the same time. So just make it a little easier to cope with you not being around. Well we can't both leave. You have to stay here and serve and protect the neighborhood. Okay, fine. Yeah, it's all about you. It's all about you. What, what, what are you talking about? And where would you go anyway? I'm glad that you asked. You know, I have always wanted to go to Italy. I hear they have amazing pastries there. Do you like pastries, 'cause I like pastries. Do you want a donut? A donut's a pastry. Hey. You ready? Yes. Come on. These are defining times. While everyone is looking for a mask to wear, I think a whole lot of masks are about to come down, revealing what we're really made of. Hey, how are you doing? How's Donny? He is great. He's out of the woods. That's such great news Theresa, that's great. Well I know, but that's not why I'm calling. Are you watching TV? Uh, no, why? Okay, turn it on right now, Channel 27. Oh okay. Now having endured a much difficult strain over this pandemic, we are coming out of it. Gracie, come here, honey. We will see normal again. I think this is all gonna be over soon. We're gonna be able to get back to normal any day now. Hey, aren't you excited? Not really, I liked being home with you. Ah. I love being home with you too, baby. But we're gonna be able to go to parks, go back to school. Hey guys, Rick Baldwin here for what will be my last vlog for productive sales. They couldn't keep us on anymore and had to close the doors. Maybe things will change in the future. I certainly hope so. But I'm dedicating this final vlog to my viewing audience, and since I, I think I only had one viewer. This is for you, Amber. I got your video message and I couldn't agree with you more. I got good news today from the mayor. It's got me thinking about the future. I think when this thing is over and the dust settles, we will realize how little we really needed and how much we actually have. Hey, you ready? It's been a while. Hey, you're gonna be great! You're gonna have so much fun with your friends. I'll see you tomorrow, okay. Love you. We will realize the true value of human connection. They say a lot is going to change soon. More people will work from their homes instead of an office. I heard there won't be as many restaurants as there are now. Maybe people will have to learn to cook. Maybe delivery will triumph in the end. Hey, I missed ya last time. I just wanted to say thank you so much. For me, for the community, you're just awesome, man. We can't help everybody, but everybody can help somebody, right? So true. Here, enjoy. Thank you again. All right, see ya! And parks, people are gonna go to a lot of parks. Maybe we'll need to build more of them. Will we all keep washing our hands so much? Will we stop hugging each other or shaking hands? Are the mall's gonna close down and will there be drones delivering everything to our doorsteps? Will we all leave the city and move to the country? Only time will tell, but this much I'm sure of. Times like this create new heroes, and some of us might soon be elevated. Well, this is it buddy. It's been a good run. I'm not in sales or anything, but I caught your vlogs on YouTube and dude, you make me feel like I can do anything! The state says I'm an essential worker, but you know what man? So are you. Are you looking at this? You were number one in sales, don't you forget it. Number one. Very inspiring, young man. You remind me of Paul Harvey. Wow. I always loved this car. It suits you. I only have it because of you. I mean, you talked me into it. It always reminded me of when you came to my parents' house and picked me up for our first date. That's a long time ago. Yeah it sure was. Feels like yesterday though. Time flies. I miss you. It's time Rick. It's time. What do you mean? You know what I mean. I came to tell you that it's okay. It's okay. I'll always be in your heart, and you in mine. I know. I'll always be in your heart. Speaking for myself, I can tell you I spent a lot of time concentrating and thinking about the wrong things. We shouldn't waste our days wishing for the past to change, for today is your best day. Steve! Hey Rick. - Hi. - Hi. So what's the issue? It's broke. Okay, well does it turn on? How long has this been like this? Since last week. I got no clean clothes. The plumbers are out cause of, you know, the virus and stuff. Uh-huh, you okay? Yeah, I think. You wanna look at it? Sure. Good. Let's go. You want me to shut this? That'd be great, okay. So you haven't had any clean clothes in a week? Nope, no clean clothes. Let's go in here. Here it is. Dead as a doornail, I've tried everything. Alright, well let me just check it out. Yep. Well this could be your problem. And yup. You fixed it. You wanna tell me what's going on? Rick, this is a check for you. I am sorry. And you had me come all the way down here for this? Rick, I need you back at the company. Your vlogs, turns out they're a huge success. Your webinars, the numbers are crazy. The sponsors, they want you back on the board. You know, Stacy figured out that all this money came to the post office and it got stuck there, so we didn't even know about it. There's a ton of checks. We just found out about it, trust me. I didn't know, I would have told ya. So this is a check from my sponsors? Plus a big bonus from... Well, I'll be darned. Yeah, I need you back. I need you. Will you come back to the company and work for me? Well, I have to consult with Gracie. I mean, you know, she's my partner and I don't make any career decisions without her. - I understand. - Alarm! In 20 minutes I want you to rescue me from this meeting with Rick Baldwin. Alexa, stop, please! Please. _ Stopping alarm, In 20 minutes, I want you to rescue me from this meeting with Rick Baldwin. I remember seeing Amber for the first time. I remember the first time I saw Rick. In this strange human stop, in this moment of scary uncertainty. We chose to wear masks, although metaphorically, taking our masks off. And in that moment we came together. This virus had forced us to self-reflect. Forced us to find forgiveness, so that we could give love to each other. Dad! Dad, are you ready? Yeah, what is it Gracie? Just trust me, okay. Okay. Where are we going? Just keep your eyes closed. And don't open them. Okay. Dad, keep your eyes closed. Well, I'm sorry. I just would like to know where I'm going and I don't wanna fall on the stairs. You won't fall down the stairs. Can I open them now? No. Oh! Can I open up 'em now? No! All right, can I open my eyes now? Yes. Oh wow! How did you do this? Let's get in. Dad, I've been doing a lot of thinking lately. Is that so? I just want you to know I'm proud of you. Ah, I'm proud of you too hun. This isn't about my grade A in geometry, we'll just talk about that tomorrow. Okay. But I'm grateful having the time with you. Me too. And you're a great dad. You're a great daughter. I know. Hey, there's the little dipper. And over there is? - Mars, I think. - Yeah. Yeah. And? Venus. And Pluto. That's not Pluto. I don't know. All right, I'm gonna go to sleep now. Me too. Goodnight, Gracie Goodnight Rick. You know, after all this time, I gotta tell ya, I had a hard time slowing down. And after all, we're going nonstop for so long, but today, with time on our side, I made some new memories with my daughter, Gracie. I met some new people like Amber, and I found a way to take some of my own risks in life. I went out of my comfort zone and I found a whole new career path. I can't say that it's been easy, but with a new normal on the horizon, I look forward to making sure that I spend more time with Gracie. Watching her grow into the young lady that her Mom always said she'd be. For me, well, that's it for now. I got a podcast to do. And as they say, time stops for no one. Right? And action! Matt, you ready? Can you come back later? Gracie, I'm your Dad. I don't need to set an appointment to talk to you.
