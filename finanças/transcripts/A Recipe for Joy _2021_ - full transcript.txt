Hi, Mom. What are you up to today? Hi, Carly. I'm mending the tree topper and then I'm helping out at the animal rescue. Lots of kids getting kittens and puppies for Christmas this year. And then then festival prep. You're the busiest retired person I know. Sold the restaurant so I could live it up. Anyway, I met a handsome young man yesterday. Mum, I am not in the market for a blind date. Okay, but I think you'd like him. I'm focused on work. I love doing the morning show but I need more creative ownership. I've been pestering Martha for months. I can't let up now. She asked to see you which I think is positive. A meeting with the boss 10 days before Christmas is a very good sign. I wanted to say good luck. Thank you. Maybe I'll get my Christmas wish and be able to produce my own food show. I couldn't sleep last night so I made frittatas in the shape of Christmas trees for the staff. Because they're Martha's favorite? Yeah. That's my girl. Okay. I'll see you in a few hours. Okay. Morning, Theo. Good morning, Ms. Hayes. Again with the Ms. Hayes. Theo, how long have I worked here? About 5 years? Okay, so for 5 years I've been asking you to call me Carly. - Make it your Christmas present for me. - Okay. I'm gonna need your help later. I have so much stuff to take out of my office. When you're ready then I'll bring a dolly up and I'll help move it. - Great. Thank you. - You're welcome. Hi, Ramona. What's wrong? Chef Grant Quinn. Oh, the self-serious know-it-all? Did you see his episode of Chef's Kitchen? Ten minutes of it. A little highbrow for chicken pot pie. Well, he deconstructed it. Oh, so he took the fun out of it. Bet it tasted great. What did he do? He's in hiding. He's really cute. Morning Carly, Ramona. Hi, Martha. Are you ready for me? I can't pass up your frittatas. I heard they were almost gone. I always save one for you. Aww. I better go too. When are you going to Angel Heights? Later today. I have interviews with all the food vendors at the Christmas festival. I can send footage in a few days. You always do a great job. So, Jason has finally agreed to let you produce your own show. What?! Oh, really? Oh, oh, that's wonderful. It's wonderful. We're thinking a Christmas episode with a singular focus. If this is successful you can get more creative with the format. Okay. Deal. What's the focus? Well, how long has your family owned Pine Grill? Uh, my grandparents opened it in 1948. And my mom retired a few months ago and recently sold it to three partners. One of those partners, Beth Walsh, is a fan of your segments. Jason pitched your show idea, she loved it and agreed to be the pilot restaurant. That's amazing. Wow! I'll need a concept outline by... I've got it. Christmas in a Small Town and Food That Brings People Together. I can mix the re-opening of the restaurant with historical footage. That's perfect. I'll let Jason know. What finally changed his mind? The chef is Grant Quinn. Grant Quinn? The chef who dismantles comfort food? Yep! The same Grant Quinn who just sold his Michelin star restaurant on the water and is now in hiding? Yeah. We think there's a bigger story to that, so maybe you can find out the truth. And Grant agreed to all this? I have Beth's assurance that he's on board. Okay, then. I like a challenge. Can I have a crew? You get one cameraperson. I'll take Ramona. You only get one shot at producing. This industry doesn't like flops. Send me your footage as you get it. We're gonna need your cut on the 21st so we can put it to air on Christmas Eve. We believe in you. Good luck. Thank you for this chance. Thank you. My wife and I watched your piece on roasted sweet potatoes. We're gonna make some for Christmas Eve. Oh, great, let me know how it is. I will. And good luck with your show, madame producer. Knock their socks off. Oh, I plan to. Hey, what's this? Merry Christmas, Theo. - You shouldn't have. - Yeah, but I always do. Oh. Merry Christmas... Carly. It's a Christmas miracle. What's that? Our tree topper. When the kids were little I'd hide it in the house. They'd find it, I'd hide it again. On Christmas Eve it goes on the tree. Oh, I love garnished drinks. Mm, that's the best hot apple cider I've ever had. It took me years to perfect but the key ingredient: peppercorns. Hm! Just a little something to thank you for pulling this all together at such short notice. My partner usually takes care of all the business. Hi, Uncle Gordie. Hey, kiddo. I'm hanging LED lights. That's very economical of you. Thank you. Oh, congratulations on the show. Christmas came early for me. It did. Oh hi, Aunt Marian. Carly! Hi! We're so excited for you. Oh no, don't get up. Popcorn will go everywhere and then we'll get in big trouble. Gordie and I loved your story on the history of Caesar salad. Who knew all that? You mom's in the kitchen. Thank you. Hi, Mom. Oh hi, sweetheart. This is my daughter, Carly. Hey, you want some... I'm sure you're a nice guy and you're certainly handsome, but I asked her not to do this. - Do what? - Mom, apologize to him. What's happening? She thinks she's a matchmaker. Oh, okay, well, then I prefer "dashing" if we're gonna be throwing around old-fashioned compliments. Carly, this is Grant. Oh no. I'm sorry, I didn't... you're Grant Quinn. He just bought Pine Grill. Of course. And he makes the most delicious cider with peppercorns. Peppercorns... hm. You're the CSN reporter. I'm the food correspondent on the morning show. I research and present segments about food history and how to cook and eat healthy for your lifestyle. You're making a pilot? It's my first shot at producing. Oh, they sent a rookie? It's going to be spectacular. Yeah, I'm just teasing. Actually, I saw your video on Christmas cookies. It was cute. I'll need you to sign a release. I didn't mean cute in a negative way, just so you know. It's just CSN isn't known for being cutting edge. Yeah, well, I'm here to change all that. Good for you. I... actually I've got to get going. Thank you again. I'd like to set up an interview tomorrow when my camerawoman arrives. I'll email you the questions. - What's your email? - I don't do interviews. I'll make it painless. Delia, can we do the photos another day? Sure. And you let me know if you need anything else for the festival. Will do. Carly, nice to meet you. Well, that didn't go well. How does your foot taste? Okay, what did I miss? Were you terrible to the attractive man? He just can't leave the classics alone, can he? Peppercorns in cider? Oh, it's so good. What photos are you showing him? Pine Grill over the years. Maybe I'll use some in the pilot. This is already going to be a wonderful Christmas. One of my girls is getting her own TV show and the other one just made partner at the law firm. What? Really, sis? Well, congratulations. We need to celebrate. Oh, I want to wait for Joel. Was he able to get leave? No, but he's gonna put in for it again. I'm excited for you. Your own show, getting to work with a gorgeous chef. With a difficult reputation. Her might surprise you. He might even be your unicorn man. My focus is making an awesome show. Challenges never scared you before. And they still don't. I have it all planned out. It's gonna be great Mm hmm. It's gonna be great. Rosemary Christmas trees. Nice touch. And there you have it, our very own Christmas log or Buche de Noel, as they say in France. The truth is, in olden times, farming families gathered around the fireplace... Stop! Sweetie... you know I know you, right? Hm. You seemed kind of sad earlier. Something happen at school today? Miss Kerr asked everyone to share their family holiday traditions, like what your mom and dad do special. Well, we'll create some new traditions, starting with Christmas here in Angel Heights. - Is it fun here? - We'll make it fun. Can we make a pie tomorrow? I do not need to make a pie. You know why? 'Cause I've got my sweetie pie. That's so lame. Well, it got a laugh, didn't it? Yeah. Could we watch the movie about the baker? If you put on your pyjamas. Do you know where my pyjamas are? Actually, I think they're still packed. So how about I go find your pyjamas, you go brush your teeth. Promise you won't fall asleep during the movie. I can't promise that. It's such a wonderful alternative to the classic Christmas cake or Christmas pudding. This is Carly Hayes for A Chef's Recipe. Bon appetit. Excited for your first day? Bursting! I have so many ideas in my head I can't keep them straight. Oh, Aunt Marian is cooking tonight because mom will be home a little late. She has dance. When are we doing the tree? After dinner. We're going to light this place up. And we are gonna have the... Hap, hap, happy happiest... Don't finish that sentence. No Christmas quotes 'til I've had my coffee. Christmas. Sorry. Hey, Dad, can I have some ice cream? Hey, Tess. Sure. Wait. We have Ice cream? Where'd we get that? I had a craving. Want some? We meeting? As soon as I'm finished scooping. Hey, Dad, you can have some of mine. Tess, you know I'm watching my figure. How many scoops? - Three. - Three? Okay, okay. Christmas Festival contract. And do we have enough staff to cover all the shifts? Oh, and Carly Hayes from CSN will be here soon. Can you deal with all that? No. It's a two-person job. She's interviewing me this afternoon a nd you're meeting her in a few minutes to talk about the menu and décor. Décor? I need to catch you up. Look, you didn't tell me this was her first job or that she wants to do some on-camera interview. I didn't? Look, I know you want to hide in the kitchen and that publicity isn't really your thing. No, no, no, I didn't agree to be part of some local news channel. Has she even submitted an outline? Look, I... I just do not want this to be some low-brow circus. - Okay, noted. - I mean it. No camera crew, no makeup, no big production numbers. I swear. No singing or dancing or fun of any kind. But you will give her an interview. Come on. This place is gorgeous. Home sweet home. Nervous? Excited. - Hi! - You must be Beth. I'm Carly Hayes. This is my work colleague Ramona. Yes. We spoke on the phone. Welcome to Salt Pepper. Grant and I are looking forward to this. I'll go get him. Can we get some before footage, work-in-progress stuff? Oh, can you grab some shots out front, too? Of course. Grant, this is Carly Hayes from CSN. We... we met. Oh. I'll leave you to it. Thank you. Carly, let's start with the menu. A lot of people been coming by dropping off these gift baskets. Welcome to Angel Heights. So, uh, got us a booth back here, cleaned up. Sorry the place is a bit of a mess. No, it's great. What? Oh, uh, my parents first met at this booth after a singles dance. So this place has some memories for you? Yeah, Pine Grill was my second home. You know, a lot of people have been dropping by and telling me stuff like that. Oh, you might not realize this, but you're bringing back the heartbeat of this town. This style always makes me think of sail boats or paper airplanes. Actually, I think these are a bit dated. Well, classics by definition are never dated. They're timeless. That's a matter of opinion. What do you have against the classics? Everything can be improved upon. Are you going with black or white? Uh, black. 'Cause it's the lint that white napkins leave on... Leave on black pants. Yes. Very thoughtful. Well, then you are going to love the menu. Hm... um, yeah. Um, seasonal is impressive, but, um... But? Well, some of these dishes just seem a little fussy for this area, that's all. Says the woman who used pre-packaged dough to bake rolls on TV. Morning shows are supposed to be quick, fun and easy. Yeah, but the CSN audience is a bit basic. Well, I would hardly call an audience of three million basic. I didn't mean to put you on the defense. I just think that Angel Heights deserves something special with my menu. And I'm trying to do something special on CSN with my show. So maybe you can reserve judgment until you've seen the finished product. Sometimes I'm a bit too honest and it comes across as harsh. I, uh... I apologize. This is the copy for the printer. Oh, they're clean, I swear. It's not that, I'm just... I'm a little bit... Fussy? Particular. Right. We're filming the food inserts this afternoon. Can you let me know what you're making? Short ribs and... Short ribs don't photograph very well. Is there something else? Okay, rookie, how about coconut braised chicken with potatoes, carrots and chilis? That's more like it. Oh, it's Ramona. Uh, it's a Christmas themed episode so we need to go shopping for decorations. Any requests? Modern and tasteful. What does that even mean? It's Christmas. Oh, and hey, can you wear your chef's coat for your interview tomorrow? I don't do on-camera interviews. Wait, you were serious? The food is the story, not me. Okay. Ugh! Don't ask. Let's go Christmas shopping. Is he as cute as he is in real life? Not really. He wants to focus on the food. The star of the show is Grant Quinn. The man-behind-the-fame and all that. You know, why did he sell a successful restaurant and leave Chicago? What's he hiding from? You have to get him to talk. He's not exactly an open book. Welcome to producing a show. Hm. - Any luck? - Nope. Maybe we should just film everything until I figure out an angle for him. Documentary style coming up. Hey, Grant. I need your help with the décor. I'll review everything later. I don't want your opinions, just your muscles. What is all this? It's from Santa. It's overkill. There's no such thing as too much Christmas. Yes, there is... it's this. This is too much Christmas. No, this is not enough Christmas, it's half... half of what I would have given you. This Santa has to go. Okay. We'll talk about it. Oh, come on! Pretend like I'm not here. Okay. We have a saying at CSN, "It's better to have an over-abundance of footage than not enough." Well, I get final approval of any footage of me. Sign your release and we'll talk. Hand me a bag! Look, you can have one or the other but not both! I'm in charge of the look of the show. And I have a certain aesthetic to uphold, a brand! - Okay, what's your brand? - Clean lines. What does that even mean, colorless? - No, something less... - Less...? Tacky! How dare you?! I know what I like and this is not it. You're being judgmental. Having high standards is what made me successful. Now the angel has to go! May I remind you that you moved to a town called Angel Heights? Right. So get a different angel and a different snowman, but they go where I say. And where's that? Here's pretty good. Okay, so if you put the reindeer up on the roof... angle the angel this way, you got more room for snowmen. Logistics. That's a weird thing to be good at. You might want to give it a shot, considering you're a producer. Hm. Hey, yeah, you can just unload that right there. Thank you. I got some new table lamps. - You wanna see? - Sure. Battery operated LED. Stunning. It'll compliment the new paint. - Paint? - Yeah, for the accent areas. - Deep garnet red. - Oh, I like it. Hey, is it okay if we work out of here? Sure, you just gotta wipe off the surfaces before you leave. I'm joking. Oh, well, maybe smile next time so I can tell. - Yeah, like that. - That? Yeah, perfect. When will the website be up? Beth's working on that. I noticed that you don't have a personal profile. You're like a digital ghost. Do you even exist? I actually came here to get away from all that. Tess! There she is! - Dad! - Sweetie pie! - You have a daughter? - I do, I do. Tess, this is Carly. Carly is a food correspondent on a TV network. I'm gonna be a baker when I grow up. Maybe I can be on TV too. Tess actually influenced one of my breakfast menu items. What is it? Strawberry Cheesecake French toast. It's really good. Yum! I can't wait to try it. Dad, you said we could bake cookies. I did, didn't I? Okay, so give us an hour? Uh hm. And then it will be... what do we say? Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, cookie time! That is my cue. Are you ready for me? Yeah, yes! Um... let me go grab some things and we'll meet you in the kitchen! So she's better at framing shots but you'll stand there and then we'll blur the background out a bit. Oh, and feel free to add anything we don't cover at the end. I really appreciate this, Carly. I'm excited for a chance to show what I can do. But I still need an angle for Grant. Any ideas? How did you two meet? Fifth grade. We called him the man with the plan, because he always had one. Probably because he was always obsessed with moving parts and... Logistics? Even as a kid. Yeah. Tell me more about the episode. Uh, we're ready. We good? Okay, yeah, yeah. Carly has an interesting vision for the sho. I'm glad we're doing this. What do you have against her? She's nice enough, she just wants something from me. Grant, do the interview. Look, as a chef I have always relied on word of mouth and reviews and I... Hey, we are doing this. You can't open a restaurant without publicity. Get on board. Hey, food's almost ready. Where do you want it? Uh, let's set up over there. I want a master shot of all the dishes and then singles. Okay. While we wait for Ramona can I coax you into a photo shoot by the waterfall? How about I tell you what I'm making for my booth at the Christmas Festival instead? Right. Your booth opens this afternoon. Three soups. Creamy pumpkin with parmesan croutons. You got a potato leek with crispy prosciutto, and a charred tomato bisque with fried goat cheese crumble. You wanna try them? Yes. Oh my God, I can't pick a favorite. That's why I have a Michelin star. I just meant you let the ingredients do the work for you instead of going overboard. Overboard? Why, because I want to... open up the customers' eyes to a better way? No, because you're pretentious about it. Oh. Let me get that. Thank you. So your soft launch is Wednesday? Yeah, after the festival people can drop by here for some small bites that are inspired by a traditional Christmas dinner. Dessert? - Got a few in mind. - If you need quality control... Look, I'm sorry about the other day. I think we got off on the wrong foot, assuming you were my blind date. No, it was actually a breath of fresh air being mistaken as someone's date. Plus, you said I was really attractive. I don't remember saying that... maybe just... handsome. - Truce? - Uh huh. Are you going to be ready in time? I'm not worried. I can roll up my sleeves. You know, a lot of strangers have offered that too. Yeah, we're a helpful bunch, but this is really important to me. I got it covered. I want this to look like a food magazine spread. A mouth-watering holiday feast. As if you could almost taste the food and feel the warmth of the fire. - Can we do that? - No problem. - What are you doing? - Adding parsley. It has already been seasoned. It's a Christmas episode, the garland stays. It ruins the look of the dish! I wasn't asking your opinion. You don't know what you're doing. I know exactly what I'm doing. I'm trying to help. - You're trying to take over. - My name's on the line. It's festive. It'll be great. Not my style! This is my vision, not an episode of Chef's Kitchen! You saw my episode of Chef's Kitchen? Some of it. Why not all of it? Carly, can you move to the left? Chop, chop, chef. Come on. You cannot rush perfection. It's festive and it's... and are you kidding me? It's festive and it stays! Okay, we're rolling! Uh, just here is perfect. Hey, hey, hey! Excuse me, what do you think you're doing? Uh, that's where the tree goes. A, what tree? This tree. And B, no that's where my jukebox is going. Uh, what? Here, check it out. This sweet baby is getting delivered tomorrow. - Nice. - Nice? This is a custom-built Bluetooth-enabled wireless wooden frame sound system capable of everything. Nerd alert. - I designed that. - What? You did? You told me to smile if I made a joke! This is you joking? Okay. Got it. Look who I found. Hey, Dad, what can I do? You can help Delia with the garland. Okay, let's do it. Well, since you're in such a good mood, can we schedule your interview? Okay, I can't fix a concern if I don't know what it is. Okay, you're new to this and since it's CSN I'm worried that it's going to be a bit gossipy and focused on my personal life. Okay, first, new isn't always a negative. And as for gossip I'm not interested. You have my word, it'll be food-focused, professional and full of holiday cheer. Grant, Tess just said you don't have a Christmas tree at home. We do too! It's just small and we're still unpacking. Then you're coming home with us for dessert and tree decorating. I've got a lot of work to do here... No buts. I'm sure Tess would love to help decorate our big tree. Please, Dad, can we? Please? I can pick her up after samba class and you can come over later. Can I learn to samba? You can. I can show you. Okay. You wanna wiggle the hips. I'm headed to class. Is Grant still out there? I want to borrow this. Oh, he had an errand to run, but you can tell him tonight when we decorate the tree. Yeah, about that. I have to go to Ramona's to go over some footage. Well, then I'll see you whenever you get there. Now I have to go or I'll be late for samba. Grant, can you add some more frosting to our trees? You can use the piping bag. So I've been meaning to ask you, why did you name the restaurant Pine Grill? My mom's maiden name was Pine and my father wanted to honor her family. I love that. He always did a Christmas benefit every year. My parents always wore matching silver outfits, head to toe. I bet they were a sight. Hi, Mom. Hi, Carly. Where is everyone? In the kitchen. Tess is sleeping over. Grant cooked up a batch of kid-friendly eggnog which is delicious. Then he went back to the restaurant. He didn't help decorate? He's weird about Christmas. Or maybe he's just weird about me. Nah, not my girl. You worked late. How's it going? Got my wish, but it came with a string named Grant Quinn. We have very different ideas about everything. Well, except napkin colors. Give it time, he'll see the Carly Hayes we all love. I hope so. Let me go get everyone so we can light this up. Wait, let's take a peek first. You're so bad. Fun, sweetheart. I'm fun. Ahh, it's gorgeous. Your dad would have loved this tree. You say that every year. Because every year it's true. What are you looking for? I'll find it. I can rummage through my mom's refrigerator, thanks. You're looking for my eggnog, aren't you? No. You charmed my family with it. Well, we were equally charmed. Tess had a great time with your aunt. They shared a puzzle. Aunt Marian's the best. One eggnog coming up. You weren't at the tree lighting. Work comes first. We take Christmas very seriously around here. Oh, clearly. You have some... you have a little tinsel in your hair. What was that? It's just a secret ingredient. Hang on, just one more. - I'm curious about something. - Uh hm? You could open a restaurant anywhere. Why Angel Heights? Well, when Tess's mom passed I realized I wanted her to grow up in a small town like I did. So you're trading the pressures of being a celebrity chef in Chicago for the simple life with your daughter. Exactly. Lots of other small towns have these same qualities. Right but Pine Grill has a built-in customer base and a rich history I'm just starting to discover. That's a lot of secrets for one glass. You won't be sorry. Shoot! It's delicious. What's in it? So many secrets. Did you, uh, sign your release yet? I forgot. Forgive me? Alright, I should go get Tess. She's sleeping. Just let her stay. Mom said she's sleeping over so you can come by tomorrow and pick her up. We're going tree picking for the restaurant. - We? - Yeah. - In the woods? - Yeah, at a tree farm. Me, you and Tess. Whatcha doin'? Making breakfast. For Grant? What? He's cute. We all like him. Good for you. What's wrong? He hasn't signed his release or even agreed to an interview yet. I've wanted this for so long and now that it's here I don't want to blow it. I don't want to let Martha down either. Speaking of... Hi, Martha. B-roll looks good. Chop chop, Chef! You cannot rush perfection. What are you sending today? Uh, I just emailed Beth's interview. She's very engaging and personable. Got it! And Grant, any information? He came here for peace and quiet. Sure he did! Keep digging. What does a famous chef do in a small town? "Fish out of water" stuff. We're picking out a Christmas tree today. That's great, film it. Oh, I don't think that that's... uh... I'm... It would make him uncomfortable to film something that personal. You'll figure it out. Yes, okay. Delia, come on in. I found these documents at the house, I thought you'd need them. You are making this transition seamless. - Thank you so much. - Happy to help. But could I trouble you for a glass of water? Of course. You remembered. Do your parents live nearby? Chicago. Right now they are on a Christmas cruise. Mmm! How long have they been married? - Thirty-seven years. - Hm. Oh... I found this little lady at the restaurant. You found that fast. Guess I need a better hiding spot! Carl and I were married for thirty-seven years too. Carl, is that how... Yes, that's how Carly got her name. Did you know that there've been three proposals at the restaurant? Was yours one of them? Carl got my parents' permission, proposed to me at a family dinner at the booth where we first met. The place means a lot to a lot of people. I hope my girl can help you honor that. We'll do our best. I'm looking forward to seeing your interview. Well, I must be off. Have a great day. Thanks. Good morning! Oh, hi. You're up early. I smelled something yummy. Do you want to help me grate some cheese? Here. Don't eat all the cheese now. Hi, Dad! Morning, Tess. Smells great in here. Roasted acorn squash frittatas with Manchego, tomatoes and basil. Carly said mine can be in the shape of a Christmas tree. Very festive. Is that my blender? Yeah, I borrowed it. You have to clean these right away or the residue sets. Sometimes I forget to ask, too. Is it too late to ask? May I please make you a delicious breakfast with your blender? Me and Carly are sorry about the blender. Oh, it's not your fault, honey. I used to help you in the kitchen all the time. It won't always be like this. Hey, in fact, in a few days I'm taking you to the Christmas festival. We ready? I just need hot chocolate. Oh, Carly, look, snow. December snowflakes aren't very tasty. Didn't you watch cartoon Christmas specials as a kid? Uh-uh. That is a crime, my friend. One that needs to be remedied as soon as possible. I've never seen a cartoon Christmas special. We'll watch one on Christmas. Now let's go, move. Hustle, hustle, hustle. I'll warm the car. Go easy on him, sis. He's a single dad in a new town at Christmas. Fine. But he didn't even try a frittata. He was so preoccupied with his blender. Chefs are divas, you know that. Martha wants me to film at the tree farm, but he already seems agitated. I don't want to make it worse by filming something personal. Play by the rules, but do it your own way. It's so beautiful. It smells like heaven out here. It does. I've forgotten how special Christmas could be. How is that even possible with an eight-year-old? Oh, what was your favourite Christmas tradition as a kid? Well, we would volunteer at the hospital and help Santa give out gifts and then we would go look at the lights. What about Christmas morning? Breakfast was my favorite. My mom would make a spread of all my favorite foods. I liked waking up when it was still dark outside. And the only light was coming from the tree so that Santa could find his way, of course. Of course. And the sight of that big tree just shiny and glowing with ornaments and tinsel and colorful presents piled under it and the smell of pine... it was like being visited by an angel. What? When you put it like that... Hey, Dad, what about this tree? Tess, you are a girl after my own heart. - What are you laughing about? - Oh, it's cute, that's all. I love it. Sometimes the little one doesn't get picked. Okay, I'll tell you what. We'll get this one for the house and we'll buy a bigger one for the restaurant. Hey, hey! I had to try, sorry. Hey, Tess, when's the last time you you had a snowball fight? Um... when I was five? Hm, I think that's too long ago. Come on, let's do it. Whoa! Okay, the old bait and switch! Ladies and gentleman, a low blow from CSN food correspondent Carly Hayes. And once again Chef Grant Quinn ruins the classic snowball with... Ah! A mix of loose powder and calls it elevated. Oof! Get her, Tess! I made a snowball. Come on! Whoa! May I remind you, you loved my eggnog and my soup. Mere exceptions! Wow! Are you sure you're not a frustrated chef, not a rookie producer? You are so good at insults yet so bad at snowball fights! Get her, get her, Tess! And my soup. Ah! You've got to have a thick skin to hang out with me! Admitting you're mean is the first step! Ah! Ow. What happened? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I just wanted it to be over. You win. I was already winning. Hey. How was last night? Tess completely adopted them. Aunt Marian's her new best friend. Carly's very generous. What do you mean? She made you breakfast, took you tree shopping and let Tess spend the night? Either she's uncommonly kind or she thinks you're cute. Well, she throws a mean snowball. I've got the bruises to prove that. Hey, the tree can't stay there. I gave it a vinegar soak. My jukebox! Can we listen to Christmas music? That depends. On what? Are you on Santa's nice list? What the heck are those? They're salt and pepper Santas. No, no, no, no, no. You gotta be kidding me. I'm not kidding you. It's a Christmas-themed episode. Not exactly my style. Well, it doesn't have to be your style. It just has to make you happy. - This makes you happy? - Yes, it does! Yeah. Well, okay then. Hey. You wanna see the new chandeliers? Yeah. Oh! Single globe pendant lights. Oh my gawd, these are beautiful. You know I tried for years to get my parents to switch to these, but they never would. You want a minute alone with my phone? Oh, I'm sorry. I just have been coveting these for a long time. You have good taste. Is that a compliment from Carly Hayes? Oh, be still my heart. Hey, Tess. Dad, can we bake cookies now? Oh, shoot, I forgot. Umm... Yes, we can. I just need you to help me with some snowman decals on the window. Okay. But we will bake cookies. I promise you, because I want to spend every moment with you and I love you more than anything in the world. Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. What did you do? Did you... did you break my jukebox? You broke it, didn't you? Yes! I'm so sorry! - Would you relax? - That's good, that's good. Pranks. That's funny. I need to move the tree. - Where? - I don't know. I was going to put it here, but I can't move it there. So how about you tell me? Oh, come on, you're doing candid shots now? I get to veto any of the bad ones. There aren't any. - Okay... - Vetoed. Let's do this properly, come on. Time for a photo shoot. Come on. - Vetoed. - Stop! Okay, be natural. Okay, do the serious. You got them? We need more? My grandma's stockings were the best. She always filled them with a mix of practical and whimsical. And they were always too heavy to hang. The ones on the mantel were empty, just for show. And the real ones? Propped up like fat logs against the base of the tree. Her stockings were the highlight of all my Christmases. Hi, Mom. Yes, I'll be there. I'm making roasted cranberry goat cheese with balsamic glaze. Yeah, I'm sure he'll be there, too. Okay, bye. Excuse me? Where will I be? My mom's block has an annual holiday party. Five houses, each house has a different course. We're appetizers this year. Come help me. You like roasting things, don't you? Roasting sharpens the flavors. Uh huh. Stop making fun of me. No, I'm not. I think it's great you have passion. Actually, you inspired me to change my pumpkin soup. Oh! You could do roasted almonds or walnuts, something that brings up a taste memory. Taste memory, really? Yes, really. Tell me a dish from your childhood and I'll tell you about a taste memory. No, I... I get it. Actually, I saw your episode on taste memories. It was pretty good. Stop the presses. Was that a compliment from Grant Quinn? All right, what's the theme of your show? I want it to be educational. Interviews with farmers, health experts, nutritionists, people with knowledge about eating right for their specific needs. Your enthusiasm is infectious. I just... I don't want to be that guy. You know, the chef whose food is overshadowed by his personality. You're the initial draw though. - They're not coming for me. - Oh, yes they are. The mayor told my mom she can't wait to meet you tonight. You're in the deep end, my friend. You better start swimming. Sorry. So what's with that bell? You know what happens when a bell rings in Angel Heights? George Bailey? It's a Wonderful Life? Grant, really, you didn't grow up watching Christmas movies? I really didn't, but you know what? - I turned out fine. - Hm. No, really, what's with the bell? My mom rings it when it's time to move to the next house. Okay, Christmas movies are an important part of the holiday season. It sets the mood for the whole month. Okay, I'm gonna make you a list of all the Christmas movies you have to watch. You're gonna be hooked after one. - Fine, I'll watch one. - I'm gonna educate you. And I'm going to spoil you with my famous spice pear cider. Oh, you are full of ego. And secrets, don't forget. Right, secrets. Come on, let's meet the locals. Can we do it later? Why are you here... really? Your mom made me come. No, I mean in Angel Heights? You don't seem that interested in the community. I only lived in a small town as a kid. It's different when you're an adult, it's harder. It's... I haven't had to be gracious and outgoing for a long time. It shows. It really shows. Christmas is the perfect excuse to meet new people. And everyone here wants to meet the Michelin star chef from Chicago! Do you miss your restaurant? It was a circus. I mean it was... Yeah, don't get me wrong. I'm grateful for the success. But there was a lot of responsibility and, uh, my home life really suffered. And to be honest, I'm kind of worried the same thing's happening here. My work-home balance is pretty skewed. Well, then it's even more important than ever to start building a network. Hm. Let me give you some background. You see that lady over there? Her parents had date night every Saturday at Pine Grill for 10 years after they retired. They sat at the same booth and split the same turkey special. And when Mr. Thomas passed away his wife still came. When she stopped coming the staff missed her so much they took turns taking dinner to her house every week and they'd eat with her. That's sweet. So what was in that turkey special? Is that really all you care about? Just the food. Well... I noticed some of the heroes are here. - Heroes? - Block party tradition. Appetizers at the first house last until the firefighters arrive. And then at the second house they eat first. Oh, you see that firefighter over there in the red dress? She rescued me and my kitten from the roof of the school once. Was this recently? - No. A couple of years ago! - Oh, okay. Come on, the mayor just arrived. Come on! That's Mr. and Mrs. Thomas. Oh, actually, I met their daughter tonight. She makes a delicious lasagna. Oh, and that was Carly's seventh birthday party at the restaurant. Oh, wow, you were cute! I didn't have my front teeth! Pine Grill was the centre of town, literally and figuratively. People would come to see neighbors, exchange news, come in from the cold, plan town events and activities. No wonder it was so successful, it was like a social club. Exactly. It opened the same month as the Railway Fair in 1948. Commuters would have breakfast before work, housewives came for lunch or book club. It became an unofficial after- school hangout for kids whose parents had to work late. They could always play with me and Marian, and later with Carly and Lena. Very family-oriented. Well, that's the focus of the pilot. Community, family, history and then tying it to your story and the new menu. Can we take some of these? No, not that one! Take whatever you need. I'm going to go make some cocoa. Okay, let's see these interview questions. Okay. Thoughtful. Smart. Does the perfectionist approve? First impressions are very important. You still don't trust me, do you? Well, look, I haven't... I haven't dated anyone for two years since my wife passed away. My restaurant got a lot of attention. I couldn't even leave the kitchen and shake a female customer's hand without rumors spreading that I was dating her. So I don't want that kind of scrutiny. I don't want to be put on display again. I'm sorry that that happened to you, but that was never my pitch or the one that was approved. Can you trust me? They say it's all in the edit. I'm nervous but I'll... I'll trust you. I just... It was so hard moving Tess here, I don't want to uproot her again. I won't let you down. For what it's worth, though, following your passion and living your dream is the best example you could show your daughter. I have to take this. I love the photos and it's great to see Grant smiling, but I am concerned at the lack of video footage. Where's his interview? I'll have something tomorrow. But we still need his release. Did you get the scoop? He was burned out on the cult of celebrity and wanted more time with family. That's all. Well, why did he sell so fast? Who's he dating these days? We need some hooks, Carly! I am thinking of a more homespun, feel-good idea for the show. Angel Heights and Pine Grill... Sure, sure absolutely, but we need everything. You know it's always better to have an over... Abundance of footage, got it. Good. And amp up the Christmas stuff. Ho, ho, ho. What, are you gonna bedazzle my whole restaurant? I have to get this camera ready. You're shooting today? Yeah, didn't I tell you? - I'm sorry. - What have you done? It's temporary and it'll look great on camera. Well, it ruins the whole aesthetic in person! Are you a perfectionist because you care what people think or because you're a control freak? I don't know. Are you freewheeling because you have no standards or because everything comes so easily to you? Every perfectionist thinks they're the only one with standards. That's it, no more special lunches. Okay, fine. Let's call a truce. This is one of my taste memories. An arugula man. My grandmother would make me a roast beef, shaved parmesan and arugula sandwich every day after school. Italian grilled cheese with arugula, tomato bisque for dipping. I think I might be in love... uh, with this. A toast. So, how come you didn't become a chef? Uh, I worked here in high school. The kitchen was lonely, even with the chaos. Then I landed at CSN five years ago and this is my one shot at producing. They made it clear if I fail there won't be another one. Can we do your interview today? Hey! Really, uh... okay, well, I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah, we'll manage. Thanks for letting me know. My lighting guy just quit. He got stuck on another job. Finish up, we've got some work to do. I thought you didn't want my help. Big difference between want and need. You forgot to smile. Oh, you're serious. What are you laughing at? You've got some dirt on your face. Let me see something? You, oh... Mr. Perfect ain't so perfect. Alright. Why don't you finish packing up so I can take some more supplies to the festival. Oh, hey, my family's coming by later. Uh, they're going to help with the tables and chairs. You know what? I'm gonna make them dinner tonight. Here. As long as you don't deconstruct mashed potatoes or anything. You know what? My food will make you swoon. Besides I'm working on a new recipe for an eggnog cheesecake. You should have led with that. - Got it? - You do it. Those brussels sprouts shredded? - Yes, chef. - Coming along? - Yes. - All right. No, do it again. Let's get 'em. Hey, good job. Thank you. Keep moving, clean the kitchen! I want you cleaning while you're cooking. Let's cheers to that! Cheers! Woo! Grant, dinner was wonderful. Absolutely. Bravo. You swooned, didn't you? Yeah, I didn't think I'd like jalapenos in mac and cheese but... it worked. And you have mastered cheesecake. Attention, everybody. Oh, it's time for the lighting ceremony. Uh huh. - You're gonna leave all this? - It can wait. Come on. Let's go. Ahh. - Okay, everybody ready? - Yeah! Woo! Oh, hey, oh... I just kinda... Yep. Just some magic of Christmas, I guess. Go have fun, Tess. Wow is right. You did a great job. Uh, well, look at you, taking a break from work, leaving the dishes, enjoying Christmas lights? Yeah, I mean, restaurants are so busy this time of year. Don't get me wrong, I like it but, uh... - You're a stress junkie. - What? I am not. It's okay. Admitting it is really hard. Wow! Good for you. The first step is tough! Have you taken Tess to the Christmas Festival yet? I was going to take her the day after tomorrow. I'll be there, interviewing food vendors. Do you want to walk there together? Yeah, I'd like that. Can you just roll me home after we clean up? You're not cleaning. None of you are cleaning up! But you cooked! My kitchen, my rules! You can't change his mind, Mom. Well, thank you very much, dear. I'll see you tomorrow, Grant. I haven't seen you this happy in months. Well, I am. This place is just what I needed. The restaurant, the pace of the town... Carly? I sent this to Martha but it's missing context or something. Oh hey, Grant. Here. Production schedule. - Yeah. Logistics come in handy. - You made this for me? Well, if you can leave a mess after dinner I can make a plan. Carly, can you help me untangle these? - Yeah. - Thanks. Oops! Sorry. Uh oh! You're under the mistletoe. You have to kiss now. Dad, you said I could be first. That's right, sweetheart. I did. Get over here! Mwah! Good tree! Turn that off. Hey, you okay? Yeah. No. I don't know. The mistletoe was awkward, right? Because you wanted to smooch him? What? No! Well, maybe he'd make out with you if you tell him how you feel. I don't feel anything! Yes, you do. We are working together. And what does that have to do with feelings? You like him, get it out in the open. You've been married to Joel for too long. This isn't how things works. Oh, okay, and how do things work? Never mind. You like him, admit it! Stop it. I'm not going to tell anyone. - You're delusional. - I'm delusional? Yeah, now how does that feel? Thank you so much. Oh, Martha. Hi, Martha... It... it's coming along a little slower than I thought. You said we'd have Grant's interview today. We need that footage to run the promos. Can you use the footage of him in the kitchen for now? Love that footage, but we need him talking about the restaurant and Angel Heights. We have everything but the main course! The show is Grant Quinn! I'm on it. I want you to succeed, but making your deadline matters. So does keeping your promises. I'm sorry, I will. So how's the show coming? Can't tie it all together until we do your interview. We'll do it tomorrow after the festival, if that's okay. I'm gonna hold you to that. Tess asked me to let her know when it's time for cake. She knows about the cake. All right, I'll go get her. Dinner was great, by the way. Thank you. You know, Grant reminds me of your father a little. In what way? Your Dad was always a caretaker, protector. He looked out for me. It's a great quality. Midnight snack? You scared me. What are you still doing here? Tess zonked out and your mom insisted I stay. And you're sleeping in that? - Your mom gave it to me. - Mm. Cheesecake? So Tess is really excited about the festival. Me too. - Your family is, uh... - Nuts? Um... Fun. Yeah. You know, I was the only child of only children. Had no siblings or cousins, no Aunt Marian. Everyone should have one of those. Right? Tess thinks she's awesome. It must be hard being a single parent. Yeah. It really does take a village. What about your parents? They always helped, but since I moved here it's been harder for them to pop in and pick her up. Never know if I made the right decision or not. Oh, well, my whole family loves you, so don't hesitate to lean on them. And you? You can lean on me, too. Hey! Save some cheesecake for me. Hm. Anthony, please. This could ruin us. I know, but it's not what we agreed to. No, I know you wouldn't. I... Okay, I understand. What happened? Anthony wants his balloon payment in six months. But the agreement was two years! He found a loophole, he's desperate. We'll be lucky to have the money in two years. - But six months... - I know! Maybe we can find another investor. I'm going to start making calls. Me too. Carly, hi. I'd like to do my interview now. The release. Thank you. You're enthusiastic all of a sudden. Not that I'm complaining. What happened? My investor suddenly needs his balloon payment in six months. So I'm hoping to use your pilot to get as much publicity as possible. Ramona should be done setting up soon. Whatever you need. It's great that you're agreeing to do this. Thank you. Ready. Ready? Chef Grant Quinn, what brings you here to Angel Heights? I was immediately attracted to Angel Heights. It's this historic town with a great sense of community and family. And the people are pretty warm, too. We are a friendly bunch. How did you discover Pine Grill? My partner actually came here for the Christmas Festival and he absolutely raved about it. So I came down to visit when I saw this place was on the market. And I fell in love immediately with the space and the location. And I got a few surprises up my sleeve for the regulars of Pine Grill. Any hints on what those might be? Nope. I'm full of secrets. Okay, well, I guess we'll find out Wednesday at the opening of Salt Pepper. Great. I'm really excited to meet everybody. Thank you, Grant Quinn. We appreciate your time. Let's get some stills of you and Grant. You good? It was good! Good job. Relax! Hey! What do you want to do next? Everything! What time do you have to be back? Ramona should be done uploading in about 30 minutes. It's gonna be okay. I just don't want it to be gossipy nonsense. I trust you... I don't trust CSN. I've got your back. I thought we'd have time to grow and now we might be out of business in six months. Well, once the pilot is released Salt Pepper will be a destination restaurant. Can I go tell Santa what I want? Okay, just be back quick. We don't want to miss all the games! Maybe we should all go tell Santa what we want. Hm. Oh! Grant, look at these! Little strawberry cheesecakes! - Wouldn't Tess love them? - Uh hm. I'm going to get them for her. You know, sometimes you can be incredibly sweet? It's to make up for the times when I'm... Salty? Spoken like a chef! There you are! What did you ask Santa for? It's a secret. Hey, check it out! Whoa, I wanna play! Let's go! I know this game. You have to unwrap a gift wearing mittens. - Can I try? - Yep. I played it once. It was timed and it was hard. Okay. Go, go, go! - You can do it! - Come on, Tess. Get under the corners. Oh, there you go! Hurry, hurry! Time's running out! I'm trying! You're almost there! Almost, almost! Yay! Agh! Look! You got a prize! Are we going back to the restaurant? Yep, and the winner's getting ice cream. Tess is a great kid. Yeah, she's a lot of fun. I sometimes feel like I'm not doing enough. You may have a lot on your plate, but you're a great dad. What's your favorite movie about food? Ratatouille. Mine too, but I didn't expect you to say that. - Why? - I don't know. You think I'm not fun! Hey, I'm fun. Okay. Just not like in a conventional way or anything? Yeah, fair enough. What did you like about it? Uh, maybe because it's animated. French music, or because it captures that feeling I get when I'm in the kitchen. You know it's like a dance, a ballet. Yeah, it's like a dance. That's it. We brought you back some leftovers. I'm almost done with the edit. Grant said something that inspired a new angle. I want to finish tonight. I've never seen you so focused. It has to be perfect. A lot is riding on this for me and for Grant. Look at the opening, let me know what you think. Choreography, dance, ballet... Does that only describe a performance or can it describe what goes on in a kitchen? What do you get when you combine a legendary local restaurant with an internationally renowned chef? Well, well, well. What? Good, bad? Looks like someone has a serious crush. What does that mean? Nothing. It's beautiful. Dad, wake up! I'm sleeping! What are we doing today? I'm gonna sleep. Can we go to the restaurant? You been eating sugar? You never play with me. I'm sorry, honey. I've been busy. What did you ask Santa for Christmas? If I tell you, it won't happen. That is for wishes, not for Christmas. Go get a game, we'll play. Aunt Marian said I could spend the night with her on Christmas Eve. Really? Aunt Marian said that? What about me? We could sit together for story time. What's that? Pay attention, Dad. What are you doing? I am going to show you a little fun. We're gonna play the mitten game. Okay. I sent everything to Martha last night. And after I beat you at this game, I can tell you all about it. Can I see it? Editors are putting the final touches on. As soon as it comes in, I'll send it to you. I think you'll be happy. Okay, but I've got another surprise for you. Close your eyes. Open them up! I guess I'm beating Santa at his own game. Oh, we'll see. Let's do it! Three, two, one, go! Grant, I need you. The Mayor's on the hold and I'm talking to a potential investor. Success! Rematch. Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas to the winner! I was distracted. Please. In the office. Hi, Martha. I appreciate what you're trying to do, but it's off brand. Jason's not happy. No, it's exactly what we talked about. It's got heart, it's got soul. But there's no dirt, there's no hook. Jason wants to re-cut it. The hook is Angel Heights and smalltown values. Our viewers will love this. Angel Heights never courted tourism money and they could have. My grandparents kept the restaurant local and made it a success anyway. That's why Grant chose it. I have to stand up for this, Martha. I'll see what I can do. But no guarantees. Thank you. I got it. Just a second. There we go! I don't want to interrupt. Grab a slice and help us. I can't. I have to go to Ramona's. We're going to see if there are any other cuts we can make. Be back for story time. I'll try, but if I don't... I'll take care of Grant and Tess. Thanks, Mom. So the mayor called me and asked me to host a weekly breakfast at the restaurant. Do you know anything about that? You're starting to learn how special Angel Heights is. Gordie's bringing the snacks. Story time! Where's Carly? She's working at Ramona's. We're so glad you could come over. She's going to be sad to miss this. The Gift of the Magi is her favorite Christmas story. I haven't read it. Well, you are in for a treat. I had the best day ever. The day's not over yet. Best day ever. Let's get you to bed. The editor just sent the approval. Double-check it. Choreography, dance, ballet... Does that only describe a performance or can it describe what goes on in a kitchen? Yep, that's my opening! Yes! Okay, let me send this to Grant and then I will help you wrap presents. And plans to become the new focal point of Angel Heights. Let's wish him all the best. This is Carly Hayes for A Chef's Recipe. Ready for a rematch? I trusted you and you made a fool out of me. How could you do this? What are you talking about? The footage, the stuff about my other restaurant, the implication that we're dating? What? No, this is exactly why I didn't want to do this. You're good. You won! You were telling me this incredible story about community and family, asking me questions, prying into my life. But this was your plan all along? - Grant, just let me explain... - No, no, I trusted you. I can't believe I did but it was a huge mistake. You got exactly what you wanted. I hope you're very successful but right now I need you to leave. Okay, fine. I'll leave. Does that only describe a performance or can it describe what goes on in the kitchen? Uh-oh, you're under the mistletoe! Chef Grant Quinn has escaped the pressure cooker of his famous Chicago restaurant and found purpose here in Angel Heights. Big town chef returns to small town roots. It's so awful, Lena. I couldn't even watch it all. I gave them It's A Wonderful Life, but they wanted Behind the Music: Chef's Edition. Hey, I like Behind the Music. Me too, but would you want to watch an episode about yourself? Yeah, good point. He's not taking my calls. He's never going to forgive me. He doesn't believe that I didn't do it. Why did they send their re-cut to you anyway? Ramona said they forgot to tell the editor to leave me off the loop. Well, what did Martha say? That it was Jason who pushed for the final re-cut and her hands were tied. What are you going to do? I don't know but I can't leave it like this. Cookie? You're the best, Mom. Carly? No, it's okay. How come we can't go to the Hayes' house tonight? We have our own house. Don't you want to sleep in your own bed? I want to play over there. Are you mad at them? It's complicated. Grant. Delia, hey. What can I do for you? I thought you and Beth could use some homemade cookies. Thank you. I heard about the investor situation. Would you like me to rally the town? Because I will. I believe you would but... hopefully it doesn't come to that. Let's hope for a Christmas miracle. See you later. Where are you going? I need to talk to Martha face-to-face. I can't let this go. Want me to throw some legal jargon at them? Yes. - What's that? - It's Grant's release form. It may be my ticket out. Let me help you. Get your laptop. Good afternoon, Ms. Hayes. Thank you for agreeing to squeeze me in on such short notice. I'm glad you've all had a chance to review the material. Are there any questions before we start? Just one. Where do we sign? Should I call Martha? Let her call you. I'm nervous, Lena. I double-checked everything. Legally speaking, you're fine. Kiddo, it is magical here! Thanks, Uncle Gordie. Hey, have you got Santa coming? Well, funny you should say that... That's not quite what I had in mind though. Ahh? For you. Any luck? Well, for what it's worth, you did the right thing. I just got a call from Jason. Did you agree to sell our footage of the pilot to a rival network? Martha, let me explain. It's not yours to sell! There are contracts in place. Actually, you don't have Grant's signed release. I consulted a lawyer and without it there's no binding contract with the footage of Grant or the restaurant. This is grounds for termination. The network is willing to negotiate a buyout. They'd like to air it as soon as possible. Please don't do this. I don't want to fire you. You don't have to. I quit. Carly. You've been an advocate for me, and I appreciate it. And thank you for giving me a chance. Unofficially, I'm proud of you for standing by your vision. But you can never tell anyone I said that. Your secret's safe with me. Wow! It's my wedding photo. Grant, this is lovely. The frames arrived just this morning. I got it them in silver in honor of... My parents' silver outfits. Oh, it's Carl and his parents. And I'm resurrecting the turkey special. But I'm renaming it Date Night. Oh, for the Thomas's. Grant, whatever's going on between you and Carly can be worked out. It just takes a conversation. We love having you around. Dad! Aunt Marian said she saw Santa's sleigh outside. Well, of course she did, I told him to come. And there's a line of people waiting to get in. We'd better go check it out. Oh, hi! Reviewers are here from Chicago. How did that happen? I don't know, but Carly's here, too. Maybe that's not a coincidence? Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas, everybody! Dad, look, it's Santa! Ho, ho, ho! Look what I've got... And this is for you! Yes! This for... no, that's mine. Oh! That's for my darling! Congratulations on a very successful opening. The food was incredible. I think I saw two reviewers go back for seconds. Look, Grant, can we start over? I pre-judged you and I'm... I've got a lot to do. I want to get home so I can say goodnight to Tess. Well, it'll go faster if I help. I got it. Go home to your family. I sold the pilot to a huge network. My cut. - I saw your cut. - No. What you saw was... I was right about you. You're like every other hack producer I know. I fixed it and I want you to see it. I don't ever want to see it. Big network, CSN, Carly Hayes, you're all the same. I'm going to bed! Don't give up on him, Carly. You saw all those plaques on the Pine Grill wall. He's worth fighting for. He won't talk to me. There's always a way. Hey, he has spent the night here. You like his daughter and, bonus, she likes you. He's a chef. And he's kind and thoughtful and handsome. Girl, he is your unicorn. You dancing? This is what I asked Santa for. Cookies? No, making cookies with my dad. That was your Christmas wish? We used to hang out all the time. I'm sorry, Tess. Things are going to be better from now on. - I love you, Dad. - I love you more. Can you say sorry to Carly so we can go over there? Hey, Beth. Hey. Carly sent me the revision she sold to Channel Four. - You need to watch it. - What for? CSN re-cut her version without telling her. - I gotta go. - Grant! She quit her job to do this right. - She quit her job? - Yes! I don't think you're giving her enough credit. I know she wouldn't hurt you on purpose. Give her a chance to explain. What did you tell me you wanted in a relationship? Someone who challenges me? And? Someone who makes me laugh. Gets along with Tess. Easy going... kind... but... Hey, no buts! Don't be dumb. I'm not dumb. Then tell her how you feel. Thanks, Beth. This one's for me. Can I open it? Okay. Strawberry cheesecake earrings! Look. From Carly. Can I thank her in person? Practical. What'd you get? "A box of Christmas spirit. "All of my favorite Christmas movies "from my personal collection. "Carly." "P.S. Check your email." Choreography, dance, ballet... Does that only describe a performance? Or can it describe what goes on in a kitchen? What do you get when you combine a legendary local restaurant with an internationally-renowned chef? Salt Pepper. Not just basic seasoning, but seasoning refined in ways that challenge the pallet, but not the pocketbook. It's all about trend meeting tradition. Clean and simple, seasonal ingredients sourced from local farms with a focus on natural flavors. And, of course, bringing people together. Chef Grant Quinn has escaped the pressure cooker of his famous Chicago restaurant and found purpose here in Angel Heights. Big-time chef returns to small town roots. He sources local ingredients, hires local people and plans to become the new focal point of Angel Heights. Right out of high school, we both worked at a restaurant together and we just saw that, you know, we thought we could do this, and we could do this better. We could make great food, and you know... Those brussels sprouts shredded? - Yes, chef. - They coming along? - Yes. - All right. It would just be a great environment. Good. I'm hoping to carry on the traditions. I come from a small town so I know the importance of community. And I've got a few surprises up my sleeve for the regulars of Pine Grill. Let's wish him all the best. This is Carly Hayes for A Chef's Recipe. Tess, go grab your coat. Hey, Dad, can we live here? I wanna be a Hayes. Merry Christmas, Tess. Hi, Carly. Where's Aunt Marian? She's in the kitchen. - Do you want to... - I'm sorry. I was so wrong about you. Come inside. "Carly's roasted veggies." For me? Oh, and now for your whimsical gift. "Sweet and Salty." Merry Christmas, Carly. Merry Christmas, Grant. Oh, so I named my restaurant The Pines because I think I fell in love with your family before I even met you. And I liked your daughter before I ever liked you. There's my salty. But you're my favorite. And there's my sweet.
