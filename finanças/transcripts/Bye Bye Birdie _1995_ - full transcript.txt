( muttering ) ( typewriter clicking ) MORNING, MR. PETERSON. MORNING, MARY. WELL, IN TWO WEEKS, CONRAD BIRDIE, THE BIGGEST ROCK AND ROLL TEEN IDOL THIS COUNTRY HAS EVER SEEN, IS GOING IN THE ARMY! THEY JUST DENIED OUR SECOND APPEAL. WOULD YOU STOP THAT AND LISTEN TO ME? THIS COULD BE THE END OF THE ALMAELOU MUSIC CORPORATION. ROSE, DID YOU HEAR WHAT I JUST SAID? WHAT IS THAT? MY RESIGNATION. MY PILLS. WHERE ARE MY PILLS-- THE LITTLE WHITE ONES? NOT A WHOLE ONE! BREAK IT IN HALF! YOU'RE 39 YEARS OLD, ALBERT. YOU CAN TAKE A WHOLE ASPIRIN. HOW CAN YOU RESIGN AT A TIME LIKE THIS? MY MIND IS MADE UP, ALBERT. AS YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN WITH ALMAELOU FOR EIGHT YEARS. I'VE BEEN MORE THAN JUST A SECRETARY TO YOU. OH, I GET IT NOW. YOU WANT A RAISE. WRONG! YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT, ALBERT. ROSIE, IF YOU'RE REFERRING TO ANYTHING OF A MORE PERMANENT NATURE... WELL, I'M JUST NOT READY FOR IT. BESIDES, THERE ARE RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCES. SPANISH IS NOT A RELIGION. IF IT'S PART OF THE COMPANY YOU'RE AFTER, THE ANSWER IS NO TO THAT TOO! ALMAELOU IS ME, MOMMA AND LOU. ANY CHANGE WOULD KILL THAT WONDERFUL WOMAN THAT BORE ME! NOTHING COULD KILL YOUR MOTHER, AL, EXCEPT A SILVER BULLET. AND I WON'T DROP POOR OLD LOU, EITHER. HE LOVED YOU, ROSE. OH, I LOVED LOU TOO. SURE, HE WAS WARM, HE WAS LOYAL, HE WAS LOVABLE. BUT HE DIED SIX YEARS AGO. BESIDES, HE WAS A WIRE-HAIRED TERRIER! ANYHOW, I DON'T WANT A PART OF THE COMPANY! THIS IS SOMETHING MUCH MORE IMPORTANT! YOU'RE GONNA DISCUSS WHAT I THINK YOU ARE, I'M IN NO MOOD TO DISCUSS IT! THERE'S NOTHING TO DISCUSS. CONRAD BIRDIE'S GOING INTO THE ARMY AND I QUIT! YOU CAN GIVE UP THE BUSINESS, GO BACK TO COLLEGE. ROSE, I AM UP TO MY EARS IN DEBT! CONRAD BIRDIE HAS A $50,000 GUARANTEE WHICH I CAN'T PAY, AND I HAVE JUST TAKEN A SEVERE OVERDOSE OF ASPIRIN. ALBERT, THIS MAY BE YOUR VERY LAST CHANCE.

( sighs ) I HAVE TRIED TO RUN THIS HOUSEHOLD ON A DEMOCRATIC BASIS. I HAVE EXTENDED THE PRIVILEGE OF SELF-DETERMINATION TO BOTH THE WOMAN I'VE MARRIED AND THE CHILDREN I HAVE SIRED. THE VOTE HAS BEEN DENIED NO ONE FOR REASONS OF AGE, SEX OR POLITICAL AFFILIATION. THERE'S BEEN NO TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION, AND OPEN COVENANTS HAVE BEEN OPENLY ARRIVED AT. LAST NIGHT, I GAVE UP THE LAST PIECE OF MY FAVORITE PIE-- STRAWBERRY RHUBARB-- TO A GUEST WHO REPEATEDLY REFERRED TO ME AS "FATS." TELEPHONE CALLS WERE MADE ON MY PHONE TO NEW YORK, CHICAGO, FAIRBANKS, ALASKA AND HONG KONG.

I'M ONLY A MOTHER, AND FOR A MOTHER, A BUS IS GOOD ENOUGH. MOMMA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? DID YOU THINK I WOULDN'T COME? A WOMAN GETS A LETTER OBVIOUSLY WRITTEN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DRUGS, AND SHE SHOULD STAY HOME? "DEAR MOM, THIS IS TO LET YOU KNOW ALMAELOU IS DISSOLVED. YOUR FRIEND, ALBERT." "ALMAELOU IS DISSOLVED." DISSOLVE ME. WHO AM I, ANYWAY? A SICK OLD WOMAN, PROBABLY WON'T LAST THE NIGHT. ALL I WANT IS A SIMPLE STONE WITH ONE WORD-- "ALBERT'S MOTHER."
