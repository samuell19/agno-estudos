How will you pay for it? Sell the farm. Call Tailfer. I already said no. Mum? Martin! Mum! Get out. What do you think of my dress? Well? Say something. It's beautiful. Hello, you! - The Tailfers left you the dog? - You bet. The bosses are on the Riviera and the maid sees to the dog. The Riviera must be nice. You bet it is!

Just you wait, I'll show you. Look what Jacqueline has got for you. You didn't... What? Who cares? The cellar's full of it. Not for him! Just a drop. There, that'll do. That's enough. He mustn't end up a drunk. All right... To Rapha?l Tailfer's wedding! Jacqueline! Can't we have a laugh? - I don't see what's funny. - I do. Stop it, Jacqueline! Go and play. Stop drinking, you're already plastered. Where is the boy? Where the hell is he now? Come and see. - Hello, Catherine. - Hello. You've changed a lot. You're very pretty. Can I stay a bit? You have all summer to see each other. Please. OK, fine. But be back for dinner. I promise. Off you go. Wait for me! What'll you have? What do you want? I don't know. - Grenadine. - I'll have a shandy with grenadine. Shandy? Aren't you a bit young for that? Please. Just this once. I don't care if I repeat. I'm leaving school at 14. I'm repeating too. I'm repeating too. Because you're sweet... Where are you going? See you tomorrow. Did anyone call for me? No, nobody. Who's going to call? Mind your own business. Give me a break. Leave your brother alone. You're dead. He's dead. Look, Malika, he's dead. He's dead? We'll see if he's dead. Didier... Seen how dead he is? Come and help me now. We've all been invited to Rapha?l Tailfer's wedding. You're burned. Couldn't you be more careful? What's going on? This idiot just scalded his brother. Let me see. There's hardly a mark on him. Does it hurt? Don't get in such a state. Does it hurt? What's your book about? Get back! - Don't touch my things! - Calm down. It's OK. Calm down, will you? I called Tailfer. I said we'd accept his offer. Nothing to say? What about Nad?ge? You could have asked Nad?ge. Really? What for? She's my wife! If she really was your wife, you'd be in her bedroom now. You're still up? Nad?ge! Open the door! Here we go again. - I'm calling the hospital. - Stay right there! Martin, fetch Malika. Calm down. Have a seat. Calm down. Malika's coming. Manage on your own. I'm going back to bed! Madam! It's Malika. Open the door. No one else will come in. Open the door. Calm down, madam. It's nothing. It'll be all right. I'm cold. I'm getting out. I'm staying in. Catherine! - What happened? - Nothing. - Catherine... - Nothing! You're injured. It's serious. - It's serious! - Are you dumb? Didier... Get in. Come on, get in. Where have you been? I'm talking to you. What's up? Sulk, then. I don't care. Are you crazy? Why do that? You could have killed us! Fucking say something! What a crazy family! Martin! Open up! Open up! Fucking open up! Martin, open the door or I'll smash it in! Martin! I'll count to three and smash the window. One, two, three... I'm sorry. "What is natural in me, "is natural in many other men, I infer, "and so I am not afraid to write that I never had loved Steerforth "better than when the ties that bound me to him were broken." What have you got there? They're robin's eggs for Mum. You shouldn't have done that. You should have left them. You do it with hen's eggs. You can eat hen's eggs, not a robin's eggs. I'll put them back in the nest. It's too late. The female won't want them any more. Happy birthday! Happy birthday, Mum. Open it. It's for you. This plant will die in my room. It won't. Come and see. I'll plant it there, under your window. It'll climb up to you. Here. This is for you. Is it perfume? Yes, the one you like. You know I don't use perfume any more. Why's he staring at me? Why is she giving me shoes? I never go out. Wait until you try them on. What are you doing? You want to make me go out, is that it? I'll never go out of here. Never! - Didier... - Hold on. - If you're interested. - I am. It needs a lot of work. The barn... Yes, but what a building. Hello, Didier. Come over here, you. Say hello to Mr Tailfer. This one's different. Nothing like his brother. He's a sweet boy, good at school... Hello, son. That's good. Tuck your shirt in... What's the matter? What are you up to? Martin! Come back here! Sit down. You know, Martin, I had this teacher in middle school, Hiagel. He was my French teacher. One day, the old fart made us write a poem. He didn't know I wrote. I picked my best poem. My favourite. "The Swinging Ballad". I was so proud. I thought I'd shine for once. Then the day to read it came. I started reading to the whole class. I was so emotional. I was there for real. I knew it was good, that it sounded right. I knew it was original. When I finished, you could have heard a pin drop. And Hiagel said, "That's wonderful. "Quite simply wonderful!" Then he added, "Where did you copy it?" He said, "Where did you copy it?" You understand? There was one subject I was good at - poetry - and the idiot accused me of copying! It wasn't true! I wrote it myself. "No, you didn't write it. I can even say where you found it." I thought, "Maybe it's true. "Maybe something that I'd forgotten for a long time "suddenly came back to me." But no, I had written that poem. I wanted Hiagel to take back what he'd said. He refused. He asked me to apologise. So I told him he was an arsehole, that I wasn't lying. I left his class and never went back. I'm not a liar. You believe me about the poem? Yes. Don't you get the impression sometimes that... something odd is going to happen to you? Something that scares you? Don't you want to play outside? Not now, I have things to finish. - Where were you? - With Mistigri. Bring the coffee and biscuits when Mr Tailfer gets here. Martin, help me with the door. - Gran? - Careful! Don't touch it! What is it? If we sell the farm, is Malika going to leave? I don't know. It'll depend. What'll it depend on? Keep your farm! I don't want the place! You won't be seeing me again! Why did you do it? Didier, I'm talking to you! He can't answer you. He stinks of drink. Get off my back. Why did you do it? Why did I do it? You have no idea? Not the least idea? You're always sticking your nose in. You tell him why I did it! It's not my business. I just don't want you at the wedding. - Really? - Yes. Tailfer doesn't want you there. We have to sell this place! Sure, you all bow down to him. - You can't say that! - You're cowards! He's totally crazy! You're the mad one! Shut your mouth! Mum, open up, it's me. Mum, I'm alone. Open up. I have to talk to you. Open up! I have to talk to you! Open up! I know you're not sick. Open up! It's me! No! Come on! They want to kill us! They want to kill both of us! Stop it! Let me talk to her. You're pathetic. - What a joke. What a sick joke. - Calm down... Piss off! You make me sick! Something was missing. You hear? Go away! Shall we go back in? I've made you a coffee. She hasn't eaten. - Nothing for three days. - All right. You're going to send her to the hospital. It's the best way. The only way. For her and for the whole family. For you. Jean, think of yourself. Everything will be fine. Trust me. Is that you, Martin? Yes. Come here. Come closer. Come on. Been to see your mother? No. Are you going to? I thought we weren't supposed to. I just asked if you'd been up. No. How old are you now? Ten, almost eleven. Ten. You're ten? Where do you go alone? I never see you with friends. I go out. Out and about. Where? Different places. It depends. We'll go together if you want. No! Want me to bring you anything? No, thank you. That's kind. Fear, O little hunter, fear You can't find him? He isn't around. Good morning. What's going on? Martin's vanished. I'll be right down. Are you all right? Yes, I'm fine. I ran away from home once too as a girl. Martin hasn't run away. I was six or seven, I think. I went to the station. I had a tiny suitcase. I wanted to catch a train. My father found me. Look, it's got a flower. Is Didier dead? - What is it? - Coffee. No, that noise. What noise? That noise. I can't hear it. Be quiet. Can you hear it now? Is it a storm? Please. Give me that. There... There, sweetheart. It's over. It's over.
