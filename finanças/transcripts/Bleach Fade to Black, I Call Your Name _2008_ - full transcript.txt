One one two one two three one two three four poison I've completed it. Who's there? What is this device?! Master mayuri. - Is there something wrong? - Who are you?! Master mayuri? Stay away! Are you here to apprehend me?! Sir? Stay away! Stay away! Master mayuri, what-?7?! Let go of me! Abnormal levels of spiritual pressure have been confirmed inside tower seven of the department of research and development! Destructive activity has been detected on the fop floor. An extremely high density cloud of reishi is currently spreading throughout the area' I repeat. Requesting emergency assistance from all squad members and the kido corps! - What the hell? - I know. Retreat! What are those things?! Move quickly! What the-"?! Captain kurotsuchi, please stop! Don't come near me! What're you going to do to me?! Hey. So you've finally lost it, eh? Huh?! What is this?! Damn nuisance. What's happening?! No! You mustn't go. Who's there?! We will erase... Your existence! The seireitei... Hurry to high ground! Serves them right. I hope every soul reaper dies. All they do is take. All we do is lose. What was that just now? What's that you're doing? Reading the letter sis left behind. It's written in a code, so I don't know what it means. Huh? Let me see... It's just a bunch of gibberish. "This drawing is your clue"? What the heck? Don't go trashing her artistic drawing! This is stupid. And besides, who's "sis"? Huh? Sis is sis, of course! What're you talking about?! Did you become senile?! You're the one who's senile. I'm beat. I'm calling it a day. Hey. We're not done yet, you bastard. Ichigo! Lets go, ichigo. Fool! Loiot! I'm not going to thank you! You must become a soul reaper. Rukia... Hey, kon! Wake up! What is it now? This drawing that looks like a cockroach with a watermelon next to it... Could it be a rhinoceros beetle? Which means... "Returning to the soul society for matters to attend to." Soul society... Urahara's shop please. Oh, thanks, ururu. So... you and... uh... Rukia kuchiki! Ah, yes! Rukia kuchiki. And who is that? What're you talking about?! It's rukia, one of your best customers! One of my best customers? Oh yes, there is such a name here. You see? But... I'm sorry, I really don't recall such a person. What's going on? Beats me. But for a second there, you also forgot about sis, remember?! Did something happen to rukia? Uh... I don't know if this has anything to do with this rukia person, but an unbelievable incident happened last night at the seireitei. Incident? Yes. Squad 12 captain mayuri kurotsuchi lost his mind and destroyed his facility. One third of the seireitei apparently is in shambles. What?! If these two occurrences are connected, it could mean that something is affecting our memories. Be that as it may, what is your relationship with this rukia? She's... A close friend! She's my beloved sis! Ichigo! Let's go! To the soul society! Right. Urahara, I need you to open the senkaimon. I see. It appears the abnormal leakage of reishi has calmed down. Each of the thirteen court guard squads have begun deploying inside the grounds to determine the cause. Damn! Good grief. I-lchigo! It's t-terrible. - L-look at this! - Yeah. H-hey... What kind of joke is this? It's no joke. You think everyone's been wiped out? I don't know about the captains, but... Where's sis? Sis is all right, isn't she? Isn't she?! Shut up! Keep quiet. I et's find rukia. The gate's closed. They're in our way. That's... You know him? By face. Hisagi! What the hell happened here? Do it. What is that? It's coming. Hyapporankan! What the-"?! Here it comes! Hey! Don't run, you guys! This is the path we walk with rukia. Let's go. Hey, what was that just now? Yeah... What's with all these people? Huh?! What's going on?! That mask... who are you?! I-lchigo, weren't they supposed to be your friends?! Hisagi, it's me! Ichigo kurosaki! Apprehend him! - Yes, sir! - Yes, sir! Just a minute! You damn intruder! Hey, ichigo! I don't know what's going on here, but doesn't this look bad for us? Hisagi, I have no desire to fight you! - Stop! - Stop! Damn intruder! Abarai! Don't let him get away! Is this all your doing?! What?! It's me, ichigo! Don't you recognize me?! What're you talking about?! Stop it, renii! I don't want to fight you! Bastard... How do you know my name? Listen to me, renji! Rukia's in trouble! Rukia? What are you babbling on about? Don't tell me... You've forgotten about rukia as well? It's rukia we're talking about! Rukia? There's no way you'd forget about her! Come on, renji! Stop talking nonsense! Renji! What's going on?! That's what I'd like to know! Follow abarai! - Yes, sir! - Yes, sir! What're you going to do? For now, we'll... You're... You're not getting away! Komamura. There he is! Damn. Hang on tight! Oh, I will. Curse you! Bankai! Kokujo tengen myo-oh! What's this humongous thing?! Look out! Here it comes! Getsugatensho! This place is... Quickly! Hanging dog... Rukia! Hey. What is with you! Who are you?! Who are you people? Sister... She won't recognize you unless she can see your face clearly. Yes, I know that. Rukia, look... look at us. Damage report. The damage from the reishi leak covers 200 spirit miles in the east-west direction, extending over one-third of the seireitei grounds. What is the status of the casualties? We've never seen anything like it. They were enveloped by reishi which turned into petrified stone. At present, we can't even confirm if they're dead or alive. What about kurotsuchi? It appears he lacks a grasp of many things. The current situation, and even things about himself... It's as though he's lost a portion of his memory. Captain komamura. I am told you engaged an unidentified intruder wearing a squad uniform in battle. Yes. The intruder possessed a hollow-like mask, and I believe his spiritual pressure is at captain-level. Are you sure? I'm positive. The thing that I don't understand is that he seems to be very familiar with us. Captain kuchiki... In particular, he identified himself to lieutenant abarai and appeared to be speaking to him. With regard to that, abarai reports that it was someone he had never seen before. This is most disturbing. Regarding what? About everything that's happened to us... Myself included. There is a crisis at hand! Consider this the most serious threat in the history of the seireitei. All squads are to coordinate their efforts to find and apprehend the intruder! I'm so sorry! Forgive me! Please don't kill me! Where am I? In an underground sewer passage. I was cleaning here when you suddenly fell from above. Your treatment is as incredible as ever! Huh? You know about me? Come to think of it... I seem to recall treating you before. I-I'm sorry. I'm sure I'm just imagining it. Don't get our hopes up like that. Let me guess! You're troubled right now, aren't you? You can tell? I can. When we treat our patients, we also touch their souls with our palms and feel the pain of their wounds and the pain in their hearts. I guess worrying about things here won't do any good. Are we leaving? Yeah. Okay! Up I go. Thanks for your help, hanataro! Oh, don't mention it. How did he know my name? Here rukia, this will make you feel better. How is it? Good. I'm glad! Can I ask a question? Sure. I know the two of you. But I'm sorry. I can't remember clearly. Dear rukia, we'll be waiting at the castle ruins of east 15. When did I receive this letter from you? Pretty good, don't you think? I mimicked the style of the drawings you used to do for us. I was sure you'd recognize it. Why didn't you write your names? Because we don't have any. What? You have no hames‚Äù? But you promised to give us names. L... promised you? Yup. In the world of the living, parents give their children names. That's why you said you would give us names, rukia. I would name you... Yes! For goodness sakes, what were you doing to get so wet? What were you going fo tell us, rukia? What is it? Oh, yes. You two don't have names, right? If you wouldn't Mina, would you let me name you? Not having names can be quite... What's the matfer? If you don't want fo, I won't force you. I'm so happy! I've always wanted you fo give us names. Rukia... Name us/ please do rt! - Name us! - Name us! Actually, I've already decided on names. Yay! _ yay! We're gonna have names! - Yay! - Now, now, don't get so excited. - Rukia! - Rukial it's coming to me. You were those small siblings! What are our names, rukia? What? You mean I didn't give you your names? Rukia! What's wrong? Are you all right?! Yes, it's nothing. Forgive me. I can't remember clearly. I'm sorry. What was I doing until now? Well... You were sleeping, rukia. For a long time. Sleeping? That's right. You were hurt and sleeping. So take it easy. We'll always be with you. Okay. Is something the matter? It's nothing. That photo! It's sis! Keep your voice down. Sorry for sneaking in like this. I don't want to cause 3 commotion here. That's a photo of hisana, isn't it? She looks a lot like rukia. Don't you sense something, too? What're you talking about? Don't play dumb! Hisana is rukia's older sister, isn't she? Rukia... That's right. Rukia. Rukia is your younger sister-in-law. The younger sister you tried to protect even if it meant breaking the rules. So you don't remember either, huh? You... How do you know about my wife, hisana? Because... Ichigo! Stand down. Captain! Damn you! Why are you here?! Wait, renji! Shut up! Roar, zabimaru! You never were a guy who listened to reason! What?! That's why I'm going to pound it into you! Bankai! What's the matter, reniji? Damn it. Aren't you going to release your bankai? Bankai? Me?! You trained so you could save rukia! Don't know what you're talking about! Roar, zabimaru! Remember, dammit! What're you trying to make me remember?! Don't push it! Scatter... Hisana was born in south rukon district 78... in hanging dog. Thanks. Rukia... Can I come over? Sure. Rukia... is something wrong? I feel like I'm breathing the air in this town for the first time in ages. But I feel uneasy, not knowing anything about myself. Rukia... The two of you waited for me all this time. Waiting for the names I said I would give you so long ago... I wiff remember those names, I promise. Yes. What is it? That... hill... That's right. It was that hill. Rukia... What is the matter with me? You were never a guy who listened to reason' Zabimaru... Why didn't you use your bankai? W-what? Stop being intimidated! Your soul should know us. Have you forgotten the exchange your soul had with us? How pathetic! What're you talking about? Byakuya... byakuya... Did you go to the rukon district again yesterday? Yes. I'm sorry. Its all ight. I'm not scolding you. I was concerned about your health. Byakuya... /t is something I have fo do. Hisana/ I'm all right, byakuya. No, you're not. You have fo take it easy. No, I must continue searching. No matter what it does fo my body. Search... for what? I have news to report. The hakuto gate has been breached. Is it the same intruder? Yes. A team made up of members from squad 10 and other volunteers are already in pursuit. I see... But how is it that this intruder is so familiar with the premises? Hey... Huh? Are you sure this is where sis lived? Yeah. That's what I was told. - Huh? - Huh? There's no way sis would be in a place like this. Hey! Yeah. It's rukia. Let's go! That's right. I grew up here with my friends, and... Sis! Rukia! You're all right... Sis... Who are you? What? Sis? What're you talking about, rukia? It's me. Rukia? Soul reaper! What'd you come here for? Who are you guys? Rukia... Stay back. Who are you?! How do you know my name?! What about me? You remember me, don't you? Quiet! Funny-looking creature! F-funny-looking creature? Rukia... You really don't remember me? Come on, rukia. It's me, ichigo! You're... Rukia! Rukia! It's that guy's fault! Soul reaper! H-hey! What's with you all of a sudden?! Stop it! Rukia! That's right! Kill that soul reaper! I said stop! What the-"?! That wasn't flash step. What are you guys? You're our enemy! What was that just now? It felt like it passed right through zangetsu. What?! Hey, you! Rukia... Who's there? Now there's someone I haven't seen in a long time. An unpleasant face to see, as always. It would seem you remember me. So what's the big deal? Surely you didn't come all this way just to confirm that, did you? You're right. I thought I'd interrogate you a bit. And if I refuse? You have no option. Your memories became confused, and after that, it seems our memories of "a certain person" disappeared. What are you talking about? This is what I think happened. I'm guessing both you and that person ran into the same enemy. If that was the case... Do you recognize this? I had the hardest time finding this in your room. Though in your present state, you probably don't even remember. Now then, let us begin the process of regaining what we have all lost. No matter how I look at it, this series of troubling incidents has to be the doing of those strange guys we met earlier! And they took sis away. But I can't believe she doesn't even remember who we are. Sure hurts us here in the heart, doesn't it? Say something, man! There's nothing I can do. They're both the same. Rukia, renji... In their minds, I don't exist. I held on to the hope that rukia alone would be different. You little... You disappoint me, ichigo! What are you acting so depressed about?! Did you whack your head or something? You realized that sis was in danger even in the world of the living. Even when everyone forgot about her, you didn't! You and sis are still connected! I'll save her, even if I have to do it alone! I don't care if she's forgotten about me! You can just sit there forever and think about it like a moron! Who was that guy?! Are you all right, rukia? I know that guy. Yes, I know that soul reaper. I wasn't asleep this whole time, was I? What was I doing until now? Why do I know that soul reaper?! I don't know. Stop it, rukia. You're lying! It's the truth! After all, we were at a faraway place, so... A faraway place? We finally made it back. We came back to see you, rukia. It took about a hundred years, though. That long? Rukia! - Rukia! - Soul reapers are all alike. They exist to only take away! That's right. They took everything. Happy things, fun things... Even you, rukia! But... Rukia? What's wrong? Rukia! Rukia! Rukia. It's their fault. Sister? The soul reapers! What's that you're doing? Hey! Don't look, you fool! 1 didn't look. Isn't that why I asked? It's a surprise for later! I was looking all over for that! You! When did you steal that lovely letter from me?! Man, she's too good for a loser like you! Kon... Huh? Sorry about that. Huh? Man... I never thought you could teach me something. I have a lot to learn, I guess. What?! Hey, don't be so full of yourself! So did you pull yourself together or what?! Kon... Uh... y-yes? Thanks. Huh? W-well, I'm glad I got through to you! I mean, you also forgot about sis when this all started, remember? My ties with her are deeper than yours, after all! You can't escape anymore! Give yourselves up quietly, intruders! That's quite a show of strength, toshiro. What? How do you know captain hitsugaya's name? Of course I know it! I'm supposed to! Ikkaku. Yumichika. I wouldn't forget you- even if you've forgotten me. Huh?! What's that mean? It's just nonsense, ikkaku. Who the hell are you? I'm substitute soul reaper, ichigo kurosaki! Substitute soul reaper, you say? Then show me... the proof! Bastard... Stand back, madarame. I'll handle this. It appears the reports were correct. You are familiar with our style of fighting. I'll ask you once more. Who are you?! Like I said, I'm ichigo kurosaki! I don't know you! Bakudo 63: Sajosabaku! Roar! Zabimaru! You are... What is the meaning of this, abarai?! Get up. Renji... Don't get all friendly with me! You're the enemy! An intruder who disrupted the seireitei! You're supposed to be the enemy! But... I can't think of you as an enemy. I know in my head that you're the enemy, but my soul... Is telling me something different! That's why I'm following my soul! Abarai... I'm sorry, captain hitsugaya! Please let us through. Treachery will not go unpunished. Head captain... The intruder must be captured. Please hear me out, head captain! That's right! We can talk this out! You're wasting your breath! Apprehend them! You?! You're... Kisuke urahara‚Äù? Urahara... It's been a while, head captain. Look! The soul reapers are enveloped. What's the matter? There's nothing to worry about. We're invincible. Maybe we sheared too much? What? If things stay this way, rukia might never remember our names. Sister! No! No matter what, we must make sure that she doesn't remember what happened that day! If she does... You know what will happen, right? It'll work out. If we wipe out the soul reapers, rukia will be with us forever. Even if she can't remember our names. Let's go. How did you get back? It wasn't that I haven't had the means. I simply chose not to. What have you come here for? I see you have a crisis here. We have no need for traitors! Not so fast, soi fon. Lady yoruichi! Haven't you all forgotten something important? And what do you suppose this important thing is? Lately, I've been having trouble sleeping from all this commotion. I do hope you could enlighten us. What is it that you know? The root of all evil. The root of all evil? Yes, but before I go there... Kurosaki. As I suspected, kurotsuchi and rukia's memories were both sheared by the same enemy. The same...? You mean the two with the huge sickle?! So you've met them? Then you'd better hurry. Go after them and let us take care of things here. What?! Rukia is in grave danger. Got it! Let's go, renji! I told you not to act so friendly! Stop! I'm sure you're all starting to feel it too. An unexplainable feeling that something wasn't right... A feeling that you had forgotten something. A sense of uneasiness... That's why even during a crisis in the seireitei, you came all the way out here for a mere intruder. Isn't that right, head captain? Tell me something. Huh? What exactly are you trying to do? I'm going to find rukia! So, who is this person? She's rukia! You still don't remember?! You were the closest to her! You two go way back! L. Was? - I can't help it because I don't remember. - Water for sale! - Don't say, "you can't help it"! - Delicious water. I'll make it cheap. - What's the matter, renji? - Would you like some pure water? Gimme back my water! 1 kill you! This way! Rukia... That's right! Rukia! Call out her name! One, or two hundred times until you remember! I have a question. Why are you willing to do all this to save her. . This rukia? Rukia... She's someone who changed my world. She shared her soul reaper powers with me when my family and I were on the verge of death. Thanks to her... I'm standing here today! What are you saying happened to us? Simply put, a portion of our memory has been erased. Let me explain in sequence. Shortly after I established the department of research and development, I was conducting a study of a certain hollow. It lived parasitically on souls and took over its consciousness. When its host became debilitated, it moved on to another. What was particularly unusual was its ability to use its sickle-shaped tentacle to shear its host's memory. Now if this parasite sheared off all of rukia kuchiki's memories from her life as a soul reaper, what do you think might happen? No. That's not possible. The best it could hope to do was attach to souls with weak spirit energy and erase its host's memory for only a short period of time. I don't believe it could shear away enough memory to erase an individual's existence. However... You're suggesting a separate power joined with it? In all probability... Memories are connected with each other. You could call them "bonds." In other words, if one person's memories are completely sheared away, at the same time, every past event related to that individual will disappear from the memories of the people around them. This time, however, there was one exception. You mean that kurosaki fellow? Yes. Kurosaki's soul reaper powers originally belonged to rukia kuchiki. That is why we had forgotten about him as well. A transfer of soul reaper powers? That is a class one capital offense. Yes, that's right. However, we owe him enough of a debt of gratitude that we can accept that offense. Of all the people we shouldn't forget, we forgot about him. The truth is, I've forgotten about him too. Fortunately, I had kept a log, so it didn't get out of hand. Just a minute. How do you explain kurotsuchi? We still have memories of him. Exactly. That's just what was puzzling me. But, as you are aware, kurotsuchi is an odd fellow. I wondered if perhaps he did something to himself? With that in mind, I did some checking, and just as I suspected... Kurotsuchi regularly made backups of his memories. Anyway, because of that, all of you remembered him. Let me repeat. All memories are connected. Well, kon? Were you able to tell where rukia is? It's no use. The seireitei is too big. But I could tell that she passed through here a short while ago. Damn it. What should we do? We're out of clues. Hey! Huh? Didn't you say that you received your soul reaper powers from that rukia person? Yeah. I did. Then your spiritual composition might be similar. Huh? I'm saying we might be able to trace her spirit ribbon! Spirit ribbon? Isn't that impossible here? Yeah. You're right that visualizing it here in the soul society where things are comprised of reishi is normally impossible! But since you possess a similar spiritual composition, you might be able to trace rukia's remnant spirit ribbon. I'm not very good at this sort of kido, but I'll help you, so give it a try! There's no harm in trying, right? Are you kidding me?! I'll put every effort into this! Rukia and l... are connected! I'll find out where she is, no matter what! Okay then, let's do it! You bet! Does it work? We did it! Wait! Rukia! I'm so glad you're okay. Does your head still hurt? What is this place? This is... uh... We're going to chase away the soul reapers who've been making you suffer! Chase away the soul reapers?! So you two used this device to... You mustn't! Have you considered how much destruction this device will cause? It might destroy the seireitei. Good! Why are you standing up for the soul reapers?! The soul reapers will come to take you away from us again! L... I... don't want to be separated from you anymore! What're you talking about? I'll be with both of you forever! I'm not lying. Trust me. No! Absolutely not! We have to get rid of them! Why is that? Because... because rukia, you're... What's that? Don't know what it is, but it seems to have started! Rukia! Hey! - Leave this one to me! - Hey! Roar! Zabimaru! Renji! I said to let me take care of this! Bankai! Hihio! Zabimaru! You... used your bankai... Hey, watch it! You almost got me! Shut up already! How's that? Zabimaru can be used like this too! I know! Huh? Never mind. Go! Bankai! Tensa zangetsu! Rukia. I'm okay. What's wrong?! I hate soul reapers! Soul reapers are... What?! Rukia, I've come for you! Sis. That's rukia? Renji... Go back! Go back, soul reapers! Rukia doesn't know you! That's not how it goes. Rukia is our friend! Rukia doesn't want that! Rukia is not like you anymore! Try to remember, rukia. The rukia I know wouldn't give up being a soul reaper! You put your life at risk to save me, a person you only just met. You shared your powers with me so that I could protect my family. You're that kind of strong person! Rukia! No! No, rukia! Don't look that way! No! No, rukia. You mustn't go back to the soul reapers. Go back to the soul reapers... So I was a soul reaper? Soul reaper. Tell me your name once more. It's ichigo kurosaki. I'm the great kon! Kurosaki... Ichigo... No! Hey... Rukia! Don't move! You! We won't let you have rukia. Sister... We'll never let you have her. We'd rather... What's with her? We will become one with rukia. Then rukia will disappear. Is that what you want? All right. We'll be together forever. Rukia... Rukia... - Rukia! - Rukia! Rukia! Sis! Rukia! Disappear... all of you... Disappear! So this is the root of the evil that messed up the seireitei. We're going to stop them, renji. You do something about that woman! Isn't that what you came here for?! They're yours. - Rukia! - Sis! Kon! Rukia... Evacuate! Now! Lieutenant hisagi, lieutenant matsumoto, look up there! What the-?! What is that thing? Rukia! Shear him away. Yes, shear him away. Stop! Rukia! Please! Snap out of it! It's me, ichigo! Try to remember, rukia! It's no use. At this rate, it'll swallow up the seireitei! Matsumoto! Captain! Are you okay, matsumoto? Yes. What is that thing? Not sure, but it looks like it means business. From what kurotsuchi tells us, the enemy should have the control lock for the reishi convergence device that he created. This terrible state of affairs resulted from that device functioning out of control. At this point, the only way to stop it is to destroy the device. But I don't think that thing's going to just let us walk in there. Kurosaki and the others are already inside. We need to keep the reishi from spreading any further. He makes it sound so simple. He's always been like that. All things in the universe turn to ashes! Ryujinjakka! Way to go, old man yama! I'm ordering all captains to stop the wild spread of reishi! - Yes, sir! - Yes, sir! All waves rise now and become my shield! Lightning, strike now and become my blade! Sogyonokotowari! Flower wind rage and flower god roar! Heavenly wind rage and heavenly demon sneer! Katenkyokotsu! Let's go, soi fon! Yes, ma'am! Shunko! Oh no! Soi fon! Scream... Benihime! Lady yoruichi... Forgive me, lady yoruichi. It's okay. It's okay. Let's go. Yes, ma'am! Follow my lead! - Yes, sir! - Yes, sir! Hyorinmaru! Growl, haineko! Reap, kazeshini! Yumichika! Matsumoto! Hisagi! What is this hard thing? Hey, this is... Captain! Are you the bastard who messed around with my head?! Morning, Kenny! Hold on, yachiru! Aye-aye, sir! Damn it! If I could just destroy this thing... Stop it! Rukia! That man... I will shear away his memories. Once that's done, no one will remember rukia. Right. We will be the only ones dear to rukia. Morons! Memories aren't everything. Renji's soul remembered me! Rukia will, too. You can't take away our bonds! Rukia! Damn it! Rukia... Kisuke! It's not going well. They're too big. We're not going to make any progress until we destroy the device in the lab tower. But we can't get to the lab tower with this in our way. What is that? Don't fall behind, yumichika! Zaraki? So he's back! Now's our chance, everyone. It'll be difficult, but we have to avoid that creature and get to the lab tower! Scatter... Senbonzakura. Kuchiki. Nice moves, byakuya-boy. I'm going in ahead. We're counting on you, captain kuchiki! Daiguren hyorinmaru! Thank you, captain hitsugaya! Don't mention it. Let's go! Ryusenka! Well then, I think I'll get serious as well. Kirisaki benihime! Look out behind you, ichigo! Bakudo 61: Rikujokoro! Captain! Byakuya! Who are you?! Byakuya?! If what you say is true, then all the more reason I must resolve this situation. Wait! Rukia is still in there! No matter what happens, we're still connected! Rukia! Isn't that right, rukia?! Her spiritual pressure is turning into that of a hollow's! It's too late. Damn it. Sis... Kon! Please... please save sis. Please save her. Do you want to save your family? Of course. Is there a way?! There is one way. You must become a soul reaper! I don't know if it is possible. But if it isn't the two of us will both perish. She sacrificed herself to save me and my family. She took a chance on me. That's why I will never give up. Do as you wish. Shear him! Kill the soul reaper! Here it goes, rukia. This time I'm sharing my powers with you. Wake up, rukia! I'm. Ichigo... kurosaki! Rukia... What is he doing?! Bankai... Senbonzakura kageyoshi! Hikotsu taiho! Looks like we managed somehow. Ichigo... Hey. Ichigo... Go to them. You two! Rukia? Is that you, rukia? Yes, it's me. We were punished, weren't we? Because we didn't listen to you. Rukia, please don't hate my sister. Help me, rukia! - Where are you? - Rukia' rukial rukial a soul reaper?! Stop it! You two! - Rukia! - Rukial are you all right? Rukia! Behind you! That was amazing, rukia! Wart! What is that guy?! I want... your spirit energy. This body is useless now. Run! You're not a soul reaper! Monster! Rukial Gel away from rukia, soul reaper! You're in my way! Sister! Yes, I remember now. But when I came to, the two of you were gone, and I forgot about it. That's because that hollow sheared your memory. And also because the siblings possessed a special ability to perform teleportation. In all likelihood, moments before they died, they placed that hollow into their own bodies in order to protect you. After unknowingly becoming parasitically attached to a dead body, the hollow rushed back to hueco mundo. However, the two took over the hollow instead. And it was their overwhelming desire to see you again that brought them back. Do you remember now? I'm sorry we lied to you. You see, our lives ended at that time. It hasn't ended. Death is not an end. You came back, didn't you? I was happy. I was so happy! I wanted to see you again, rukia. You're the only person we had. You're not alone. You each had the most important person right next to you the whole time. I remembered your names. Homura. And shizuku. Together, it means the two of you shine brightly. Homura... Shizuku... Yay! _ yay! Names/ they're nice names. That's what we wanted to hear. I'm so happy. Homura. Thank you. Goodbye, rukia. Homura! Shizuku! Don't go! No... no! Homura! Shizuku! Answer me, please! Dear rukia, we'll be waiting at the castle ruins of east 15. Pretty good, don't you think? I mimicked the style of the drawings you used fo do for us. Ichigo, are you going back? Yeah. You saved me once again. You were the one who originally saved me. You know, if death isn't really an end, then that time we met might not have been the first. We might have been connected from long before that. I'm not really sure, but I think maybe once a bond is formed, it never disappears. If that's the case, even if we forget everything, we'll be connected again somewhere in the future. That'll be true for you, and those siblings as well. Yes. Well, I'll be heading back, soul reaper. Don't call me soul reaper. I'm rukia kuchiki. What will the moon shine upon tonight? A thick cloud blankefs the sky who is holding you tonight? Alone in the rain, I cry Ashamed at thinking we could understand each other completely I go up to the rooftop with a dazai book in my hands and grumble about this world when I spat into the sky, it just fell back on me I consider myself a traveler, but I hate losing my way and making detours under a roof that protects me from wind and rain, I look at the world through Google words of love that never reach you what will the moon shine upon tonight? A thick cloud blankefs the sky who is holding you tonight? Alone in the rain, I cry my unyielding bluff and pride follows me into my relationships making it hard fo even hold on fo the hand that is letting go though I knew I'd never see you again if can't see the moon tonight, I'l wait for a break in the clouds when you look up at the sky tonight, can you see the moon? I want to go out into the wilderness and see the angelic light I get tired of myself and the way I am I talk big like everything is stupia, like I know everything I hide my incapable self and conceal the truth all it lakes fo see the invisible is fo close your eyes even if you're not here, even if we can't see the moon tonight Hey! Somebody! Why won't anyone come to rescue me? Ichigo! You haven't forgotten me, have you? First sis, and now you? Dammit! Sis! Sis! Sis! Don't forget me!
