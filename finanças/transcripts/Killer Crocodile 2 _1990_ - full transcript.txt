(suspenseful electronic music) (motor whirring) (crocodile hissing) (Kevin grunts) - Ha! Ya! (soft suspenseful music) (ominous music) - [Ben] See what I told ya, Claire? River widens out so much here, it looks like a lake. - [Claire] Oh, it's gorgeous. - [Ben] There's always enough wind to push it forward. Hey, gimme a hand with this, will you? - [Claire] What happened to Ben the lonely navigator, the one who won't accept anyone's help? - Come on. (ominous music) Hey, move it, girl! Otherwise I'm gonna leave you high and dry. So damn stubborn. I told you there's no one here. You can do without your bathing suit. - [Claire] The trouble is when I take off my bathing suit, I feel naked. - [Ben] Good God, who writes your material? - [Claire] The water's warm. - [Ben] So hurry up. - [Claire] Hold on! - The wind is great. - [Claire] (laughs) Yeah. - Best windsurfing in the state! - [Claire] I love it! - Woo! (Claire laughs) (ominous music) (suspenseful music) Watch out. You might fall down. I'm gonna hang a hard left here pretty soon. Hang on tight! (crocodile hissing) - Oh, Ben! Ben, help! - Okay! - Help! - Can't 'til I turn around. - Hey! - Claire. - [Claire] Hey! - Come on, Claire. Be right there. - [Claire] Help! Help. - Watch out. Here I come. (Claire grunting) Grab onto the boat and I can move on. She's full. (Claire grunting) Just try it! (Claire screams) Claire! Claire! - [Pops] Got it. - Hey, gimme a hand, will you? Did you paint the radioactivity symbol on this one, too? - They told me to paint it on 12 barrels and this is the last one. - Okay. - Here. Ready? - Gimme a hand, huh? You done with this shit, man? - Yeah, this is your last fuckin' barrel in this fuckin' swamp. (grunts) Men. - [Mosquito] Here we go. - [Pops] We're getting out of here tomorrow, too. And we ain't coming back, you can bet on it. I can't stand this shit-filled swamp anymore. - Watch your mouth, amigo. This swamp is cursed. - Our job is over, Mosquito. Like the man said, we're getting out of here. Tomorrow can't come too soon. - Miami, here I come. Women, booze, and fun. (chuckles) - Hey, and tomorrow, don't load up the boat with stuff you don't need, huh? Leave the rest of your crap behind, otherwise we don't make it. - Yeah, you just get here on time. We'll take care of the rest, okay? - Yeah, if I come back to get you. Or else you can forget about your Miami. - No fuckin' around, man. - [Pops] No funny tricks, Mosquito. That's friendly advice. - Don't shake your little asses around too much. It's full of crocs around here and they have bad tempers, so to calm their nerves they eat people alive, get it? Bye-bye. (speaking in foreign language) - [Pops] See you tomorrow. - Murder the bastard. (suspenseful music) (Mosquito speaking in foreign language) - Is it true what he was saying about the crocodiles? - [Pops] Nah, all we got here is leeches and flies. (ominous music) (crocodile grumbling) - Hello, hello? - [Jean] International Publications, may I help you? - [Russell] Hello, Jean? - [Jean] Yes. - [Russell] Jean, it's me, Russell. Give me the editor, please. - [Jean] Just one moment, I'll see if he's in. Can you hold on? (phone ringing) It's Mr. Russell on line two, sir. - Yes? - Listen to me, John. I have very important information, a scoop! - Are you sure? - And it could blow the lid off the entire organization. - Get the documentation, Russell, on the quiet. I don't want you to disappear. - Ah, don't worry about me. - [John] I'm just worried about seeing that material. - I've taken the necessary precautions. - [John] Just get it to me quick as you can. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - [John] I mean it. - Okay. Goodbye. (car horns honking) (suspenseful music) - [Man With Gun] Turn around nice and slow. (gun firing) - No! - We gotta get the body outta here and get rid of it. I mean now. (gentle music) - Morning, everyone. - Hi, Liza, how ya doin'? - Morning, Liza. - [Liza] Ready to drop, thanks. - Late again this morning, huh, Liza? Had to burn off a lot of that old midnight oil last night I bet. - What time did ya get in? - When you write the society news it comes with the territory. If only it weren't all so damn dull. And every decent looking man you see at these parties is either married or a faggot. I can't wait to write something serious. - Oh, you wanna win yourself a Pulitzer Prize now? - That's a good idea, just to see you turn green. - No risk. Don't worry about my skin changing color for the next little while. - I really wanna write something different. Be a hell of a change. - Well, you might try writing obituaries if you're able. Takes talent. - Oh please. - [Brunette Coworker] A lot of the greats started out that way. - Well, you could do articles on new recipes. With your passion for diets you'd just wow them. - Your sense of humor leaves a lot to be desired. One of these days I'll make you eat your words. - Well I wouldn't mind that so much. It's a cute thought. As long as I don't have to eat your recipes. (women laugh) - Liza, it's the boss man. He wants to see you in his office. - [Brunette Coworker] Go for it, kid. - The big boss fellow? I'm wondering just how he wants you, medium rare? - I'll let you know. - Liza, I have a feeling about it this time. I'm not kidding. Hurry back. I'm just dying of curiosity already. - You'll survive. - [Brunette Coworker] Liza, move it, for God's sake. (knuckles tapping) - Liza's here, Mr. Brown. - I just have to check out some data and I'll be right with you. - Oh sure. Mr. Brown, I've got some ideas on... - Unh-unh, don't move, please. I just gotta check these and I'll be right with you. - All right. - I'm almost finished. - Take your time, I'm in no hurry. - That's the kind of attitude I'd like to see you develop, Liza. Work on it. (door thuds) (Liza sighs) - Why so woebegone? Did you get dropped? Didn't you even get propositioned? Aw, where ya gonna find another job? - No place. I got a special story to cover and I got a plane to catch. The Caribbean oughta be just gorgeous this time of year. I'll send you a postcard. - [Blonde Coworker] Oh well, win a few, lose a few. - [Brunette Coworker] Only when does the winning start? (Liza clears her throat) (man grunts) - Oh shit! - Here, ya might still need this. You can use it to hang yourself. (airplane screeching) - Yeah, I sent Liza to the Caribbean. You've always let me run the office my own way. - Well, Jim, in this situation we got troubles. - Give her a break. Let's see what she does. She knows how to keep outta trouble. - [John] Couldn't you have sent a man? I don't like the thought of a girl being down there all on her own. - Liza's the best. I know I made the right choice. I'm telling you, she's capable. She's got guts, persistence, and intelligence. Don't worry. - [John] I told her to be sure to call me if there are any complications. If we have to, we'll send someone else down there. Talk to you later. - [Mr. Baxter] This whole area is a potential goldmine. I'd be a gibbering idiot if I didn't try to exploit it. - [Pilot] Sure, but those damn disappearing barrels are a real problem. We've looked under every rock for miles and miles, but nothing, zilch. - [Mr. Baxter] Well, if you boys couldn't find them, no one else will either, that's for sure. Even if they're a potential danger, it's a risk I have to take. At any rate, go on looking for them, but I can't put off the start of construction for the tourist village one more day. I've pushed through the financing deal with the bank. And every day's delay will cost me a fortune in interest alone. I'm giving a press conference today to announce the beginning of construction. (ominous music) (children singing in foreign language) - Yes, keep the rhythm going. (children singing in foreign language) (suspenseful music) (children singing in foreign language) (ominous music) (crocodile grumbling) (children singing in foreign language) That was wonderful, children. You deserve applause. Excellent. Marvelous. You're ready for our concert tomorrow. (nun and children clapping) Marvelous, I'm proud of you. And now it's time for our afternoon prayer, isn't it, children? (ominous music) The crocodile! Hold on tight. (children chattering) Don't let go! (children chattering) He'll take us down, pull around! (children chattering) - [Child] The boat is going under. (children crying out) - Oh my God. (children chattering) No! (children chattering) (Nun cries out) Help them. (children chattering) Hang on! (children chattering) Lord, save them! (crocodile hisses) (children chattering) It's a monster. - Hey, that must be him. - Okay. - Oh yeah, it is. - Come on. (cameras clicking) - Mr. Baxter, Mr. Baxter. - Watch out. - Get outta my way. - Go this way for me, sir. - [Photographer] Will you get outta my way? - [Reporter] Hold on a second. - Move over this way, huh? - Yeah, thank you. - Thank you, Mr. Baxter. - Move back. - Could you, thank you. - One more, one more. Give us a smile. - Thank you, sir. - Walk this way, would you? - Thank you very much. Hold it. - Could you just hold it there for a second? - Right there, right there. - This way, Mr. Baxter. - Thank you. - One more, please, one more. - Okay, one more. - Thank you. - Okay. - Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming here today. It is with a great deal of pleasure that I announce that once again, our children will be able to enjoy one of our country's greatest natural assets, our Isabella River, once polluted by criminals with no love for their country or its people. - Will the swamp be reopened afterwards? - Yes. - [Reporter] What about the river? - The swamp and the river have been cleaned up. In fact, right at this moment, the last barrel containing toxic waste has reached the port. - Mr. Baxter, does this include the radioactive barrels? - I have asked you here also to announce... - Mr. Baxter, I asked you a question. - I don't think we've met before, Miss... - Miss Liza Post from the New York Chronicle. - Yes, all the barrels and all the harmful things they contain have been removed. Any further questions? - Mr. Baxter, are you still interested in the development of the area? - As of a matter of fact, that's the announcement I wanted to make before I was interrupted. Construction has begun for the greatest, or I could say largest resort of the Americas. It will have the effect of increasing tourism, which as we all know is a largely untapped source of income in this country. - So when do we celebrate this, Mr. Baxter? - Right now, ladies and gentlemen. (reporters applauding) - Bravo, that's what I like to hear. - Enjoy. - Hooray, Mr. Baxter. (reporters applauding) Yeah, yeah. (reporters chattering) - [Reporter] Same thing. - [Man] Well I think it could work really. - [Reporter] Yeah, I think so, too. A very good idea. (reporters chattering) I'm sure it's gonna bring all sorts of incredible (mumbles). - [Man] Yeah. (birds and insects chirping) - Damn mosquitoes. They'll eat ya alive and then give you malaria. Shit. This can's finished. - There's another one in there. - Hey. (Pops laughs) Look what I found. - Put it in his plate, yeah. - Everything okay? Find the mosquito spray? - Like hell, everything's okay. I hate this goddamn swamp. Shit. (men laughing) I hate this fuckin' place, I hate it! - Will shooting us help? - Fuck you. (men laughing) (soft suspenseful music) - No radioactivity, nothing. - Fuckin' mosquitoes. Everything in this shitty place. Everything. (animals squawking) Everything. (gun firing) (gun fires) (bees buzzing) (water sloshing) (gun firing) (ominous music) (crocodile roars) (gun firing) (suspenseful music) Pops, Dale! Pops! - Shit, same old fucking story every night. Thank Christ we're leaving tomorrow. - Miami. (Pops chuckles) - [Jeff] Pops! Jesus, Jesus it... - Have you finished being an asshole? What's wrong now? - A big crocodile, it almost got me. - Ah, you're drunk. - No, fuck, a big crocodile, the biggest one I ever saw in my life! - Sure. - It's 40 feet long, maybe 50. - How many inches? (Dale laughs) - I saw it. It's the biggest crocodile with the biggest mouth. - All right, watch yourself. - I tell you, like that! (crocodile roars) - Get a rifle! Get the rifle! (suspenseful music) - Get back. - Pops, the rifle. - I can't get it. I can't reach it. - Jesus, Jesus, let me try. No! (cries out) - No! No. No, oh no! - Yes, operator, I'd like to make a collect call to Florida. It's area code 305 and the number's 260-2943. That'll be to Paul from Liza. - [Paul] Hello? - Paul? Hi, it's Liza. Paul, can you hear me all right? - Sure, Liza, what's up? - You're not gonna believe this. Those radioactive barrels are still in the swamp and that bastard wants to build a resort. - Are you sure? - Of course I'm sure. Don't you remember? Before I left we did the research together and there were 15 radioactive barrels still there. Now I just checked, and they're not among the salvaged ones. The Geiger counter gave me no reading at all. - So that son of a bitch is sending people to live in a contaminated area and has that goo still hidden out there somewhere? - You finally got it. The man is dangerous. - Okay, Liza, I'll send someone to help you out. - What? Look, Paul, this is my story. I don't need anyone else here. I can handle it by myself. - Oh, cut the crap, this is work. I don't wanna lose you or the scoop. - And just who is this genius anyway? - The only one who knows the swamp well, Kevin. - Who? - Kevin Jones, you know him. - Shit. - [Paul] (chuckles) By Liza. - Excuse me, I'm looking for a man named Pedro who has a boat for hire. - Down there by the wharf. - Pedro? Excuse me, Pedro. I want to hire a boat. Do you understand? I want to hire a boat. - Where do you want to go? - Into the swamp. - Why? - This is why. Will it do for a reason? - (grunts) It's a very good reason. When do you want to go? - This afternoon, before sunset. - [Pedro] Bueno, senorita. (sultry electronic music) - [Mr. Baxter] All right, let's head for shore and that drink. (chuckles) - Mr. Baxter. - Last night she was nosing around the warehouse where we keep the barrels, and this morning she hired a fisherman's boat to go to the swamp. - She's not giving up, eh? Doesn't she realize that that swamp is, shall we say, very dangerous for a woman? When is she going? - This afternoon, Mr. Baxter. - Pay the fisherman off. I want him to scare her, but not to overdo it. The little lady's in the wrong place at the wrong time. I want her on the first plane out of here, understood? - Got it, Mr. Baxter. - Shall we continue our promenade? (women giggle) (boat engine rumbling) (suspenseful music) (ominous music) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) - Hey, what's the matter? Why are we stopping? What's wrong, won't the engine start? Do you mind telling me what's going on? (zipper hisses) (laughs) Shit. You gotta be joking. Just what I need. Look, you can't scare me. I mean, I come from New York and we got the pros up there. Yeah, that city has weirdos that make you look like Bambi. You understand? I'm warning you. (chuckles) I don't believe this. Pedro cries out. (Pedro speaking in foreign language) (laughs) I told you. (Pedro speaking in foreign language) Pedro the pervert. - [Pedro] No, oh. - Come on, you can get back in the boat if you promise to be a good little boy. Are you going to be a good little boy, hm? - Si. - Are you sure? You're not gonna try any tricks? - No, no. - Okay. Behave yourself, got it? - Si. (ominous music) (crocodile roars) (Liza screams) (Pedro speaking in foreign language) (Pedro gasping) - [Liza] Come here, gimme your hand. - Oh, oh no! (suspenseful music) Leave me alone, por favor! - [Liza] Pedro, come on! - Holy shit, oh. Are you coming? - [Liza] Stop fighting me. (Pedro screams) Watch out, Pedro! (crocodile roars) (suspenseful music) (Liza whimpering) (Liza whimpering) (crocodile roars) (Liza screams) - Thanks a lot. - Thank you, sir. (hotel guests chattering) - You hungry? - Yeah. (hotel guests chattering) - Luis, customer. (woman laughs) (hotel guests chattering) - Good morning, may I help you. - Ah yes, I think you should have reservations for me here. - Your last name, please? - Jones. - Jones? (hotel guests chattering) - [Woman] He does this all the time. He says he'll be here for lunch. - Yes, Mr. Jones, we have your reservation. Would you sign here, please? - Is Liza Post in the hotel? - No sir, she's out. - You know where she is? - No sir, she asked me where she could rent a boat, but I don't know where she went. (hotel guests chattering) Here's your key, and have a nice day. - Thanks for the information. - You're very welcome, sir. - [Woman] His nails. (boat engine rumbling) (suspenseful music) (girl screaming) - Please, help, help! Mommy, help! (screaming) Mommy! (screaming) Help me, Mommy! (soft suspenseful music) (insects and birds chirping) - Oh. (snake hissing) (Liza sighs) (snake hissing) (soft suspenseful music) (fly buzzing) (Liza cries out) Damn it. Son of a bitch. Shit. (Liza groans) Damn. (animals chattering) (frog croaking) - This'll bring ya luck, kid. Now lemme see if you got the guts to finish the job we started together. Get it good and hot! Get that propellor up to full revs and make the bastard gargle with it. It's your only chance, kid. Go! - It's hot. - Okay, let's go. (Kevin grunting) (propellor whirring) (crocodile hisses) Now! (Kevin grunts) You're back, kid, huh? (gentle music) You're just in time to sample the newest batch. Here, it's tasty. No chemical additives, pure as a mountain stream, just like always. Go on. (Kevin grunts) - What do you say? - It's a bit strong, just like all the other batches, but not bad, not bad at all. - When did you come in, kid? - This morning. - Let's go inside. (gentle orchestral music) Can I get you something? You hungry? Want a cigar? - No thanks. How's your arm? - (sighs) Couldn't be better. I can hardly feel it anymore. Why did you come back, kid? - I was supposed to meet a girl at the hotel. Only instead of waiting for me, she went out into the swamp. - Strange place for a romantic appointment. - Joe, she's disappeared. - Ah, so that's it. When did this happen? - Yesterday. I found what was left of her boat. - Where? - In that lagoon to the south. And I wish I'd never seen it. - What the hell are you tryin' to tell me? - There's another one, Joe, another son of a bitch. - It's impossible. - I saw what it did to that boat. There were teeth marks, big ones. - It might've been a crocodile, but nowhere near as big. There just aren't any more like that one. It was the only one. That's gospel, kid. Ya better listen to it. - I know it exists. Can't you feel it? - What do you want? - Help me. Help me find the girl, if she's still alive. And if there really is a crocodile, help me hunt it down. - Weren't you the guy that once upon a time protected animals and nature? - That crocodile destroyed my life. It killed all my friends. Every night since then I wake up in the middle of the night screaming. - So, you've come to drive out your fears. - Something like that. - And the girl? - We'll find her. We have to find her. (soft suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (flies buzzing) (ominous music) (flies buzzing) - That girl must be having a pretty rough night out here. If she's still alive. - I'm sure she is. She's a very courageous, self-sufficient woman. I know her and I know what I'm talking about. I wonder. You think we'll make it this time, Joe? - If that crocodile really exists, it's gonna be tough. - It exists. And it knows we're here. (ominous music) (ominous music) (suspenseful music) It's waiting for us. (engine rumbling) - Wait! Wait! Come back here! (crying) (water sloshing) (ominous music) (gentle music) (ominous music) (suspenseful music) - What's wrong? What is it, kid? - I don't know. I feel something. Nothing. Joe! (soft suspenseful music) Gimme your hand, Joe. Come on. Swim closer. - Help. - Joe! Joe! (suspenseful music) Joe. Gimme your hand, come on. - It's too late. - Don't say that. - You have to do it. You have to kill that bastard, kid. (suspenseful music) Don't miss. - I'll kill him, Joe. I swear to God. I swear to God I'll kill him! (soft suspenseful music) (boat crunching) Hey! (Liza gasps) Liza. - (sighs) Is that really all you have to say? - That is your name, isn't it? - Jesus, you passed right in front of me and I yelled myself hoarse. There you were and I couldn't even attract your attention. - Two days I've been in this swamp, looking for you everywhere, and you have the nerve to be furious. Would you get in the boat now? - [Liza] Just get me outta here. (gentle music) It was a crocodile, Kevin. It chewed up my boat and killed the guy who was driving it. I saw it all happen. It was gigantic. It was horrible. - [Kevin] I saw it, too. Little while ago it killed an old friend of mine. I swore I'd kill it. - [Mosquito] Go slow or they'll hear the engine. - Hey wait a minute. Stop! - Huh? Why? - Get the rifle. - What are ya doing? - You want that croc, I'll be your bait. - Oh Liza, for God's sake, don't be an idiot. That thing's a monster. It can't be killed with a rifle. You need an atomic bomb. Liza. Get outta there. Liza! This is ridiculous! Where are you? Liza! You're outta your mind. Get outta the damn water, Liza! - It's my Geiger. I know I lost it somewhere around here. And the croc... - Just get out, will you? - I can't find it. - Thank God, he'd have killed you. - You'd have shot him with the rifle. - I already told you a cannon wouldn't be enough. The rifle wouldn't even make a dent. - (grunts) Get your filthy hands away from there. - It's either that or I can't haul you onboard. - You always did have an excuse for everything. - Well, what the? - [Liza] Christ. - I should've left you down there. Really. - [Liza] I would've been mixing with a higher class crowd, that's for sure. - Problems, she gives me problems. - Yeah, I know they'll be mad as hell 'cause we're late, but what could we do about it? We'll give them a hand loading. Maybe that will calm them down. (laughs) Jeff! - Hello! - Where are you? Jeff, Pops! What is this? The place is wrecked. What the hell happened around here, a tornado? Jeff! Pops! Where are you? - What do you want, Mosquito? - I got to talk to Mr. Baxter. - I'd like to see if you agree with me. The view is better up here. Look at the skyline. We can have a big neon sign over there and the pool down there. - Right in front here? - Looks like the best place to me. It has to be at least Olympic size with springboards, platforms, a waterfall in one corner, maybe a grotto dug into one of the sides. And I'll have other ideas. This place will be drawing millions of rich tourists. It's my intention to see it totally... Would you be so kind as to forgive me? We'll finish the session a little later. - Sure thing, Mr. Baxter. - No problem, sir. - What happened now? - That asshole fisherman has disappeared. He hasn't been back. No one knows, I've asked all around. - And the girl? - She's still in the swamp. - Good. - Yeah, but she's not alone. That guy who killed the crocodile is there. He took out a boat yesterday and finally tracked her down. I saw them together. - We're both experts. We're both damn good at cleaning up swamps, right? - Right, sir. - So we know what we have to do. Let's clean it up for good this time. I don't want anymore mess ups like with the fisherman. Let's do it right. - You got it. - Okay, Mr. Baxter. (gentle music) - Drink this. It's strong, it'll do you good. (Liza grunts) - Jesus, what is it? - It's Joe's specialty. Don't ask what goes into it. - He was a good friend of yours, wasn't he? - Yeah. We went through a lot together. He was one hell of a guy. - Will you help me find the barrels? - Of course. You don't think I trust you to do it alone? (Liza chuckles) But first I have to kill that crocodile. - Okay. If it's that important to you, then it's a deal. But there's one thing I'd like to know. How are you planning to kill that monster? Persuade him to commit suicide? - Ya know, that might be our only chance. Your clothes are dry if you wanna get dressed. - [Liza] Kevin. - Yeah, what is it? - Kevin. - [Kevin] Oh God, what do you have in mind now? - Kevin. Don't you know that fear and near death situations stimulate and heighten the arousal of a human being's reproductive organs? - Really? My dad always said I should try to learn something new every day. - Well maybe it's Mother Nature's way of avoiding our extinction. - If it is, she sure has a couple of tricks up her sleeve, doesn't she? (horn blaring) - Bring her in closer. Let's go. Don't forget, Mosquito, I'm in charge of this operation. - Yeah, right. - No mistakes this time. As soon as we see them, we kill them. (gentle music) - Good morning. - Good morning. - Uh-huh. I see you managed to help yourself. - Yeah, you like them? - Beautiful. Did you sleep well? - Very well. - Didn't have time to make coffee. Got up early to fix the boat. - Doesn't matter. - You know how to use that coffee machine? - Well sure I do. Just because I'm a city girl, that doesn't mean that instant is the only kind of coffee I know how to make. (snake hisses) (Liza screams) What the hell is that? - (laughs) I see you've met Pilar. - [Liza] Pilar? - She was Joe's sweetie. (chuckles) - Nice friends. - City girl. (chuckles) (boat engine rumbling) (gentle music) - Boo! (Liza gasps) - Very funny. (Kevin chuckles) - Watch this. (match hisses) (Liza gasps) (fuse pops) (Liza gasps) They're perfect. - So what do we do now? - Well, first we head back into town, get some more equipment. And weapons. And we gotta get a bigger boat, too. We can't face that monster in that coconut shell they call a boat. One swipe of its tail, it'd fall to pieces. - Kevin. - What? - Will the croc let us through? - Want me to ask him? (Kevin and Liza chuckle) - And we wouldn't even be in this position if it weren't for that Baxter dumping those barrels. And on top of it, the bastard's reopened the area to the public, claiming it's safe. (boat engine rumbling) (ominous music) - That's the roof of their hut. I don't know, how'd it get down here anyway? (somber music) - I don't see a thing. (crocodile hisses) (Mosquito screams) (gun firing) - Gunshots. Move. - [Liza] Oh God. (ominous music) - Hurry. - Oh! - [Man With Ponytail] Shit. (crocodile hisses) - We gotta get crackin'. - Who could have been doing that shooting? - I don't know. There's something over there! Oh Jesus. (Liza gagging) The crocodile, it must be near. What did they want? - Me. - Nah. - Yes. Look, that's the crocodile. - Shit. - As big as a house. (ominous music) - Hold tight. (suspenseful music) (boaters chattering) - Hey, this is great! - [Woman In White] I'll try to go faster. (couple laughing) - Get outta here. - Look. - Christ. Watch out, stop, stay there! - Hey! - Hi! - Hi! - Hi, hi, hello! - Go back! - Turn around! - Danger, go! - Look out! - Go back! - Go away! - (laughs) Hi. - Hi! - Hello, hi! - No, go back! - Hi! - No, stop! (couple laughing) Turn around, go! - Go! - [Kevin] Go! (suspenseful music) (woman in white gasps) (woman in white screams) - Mama! - No! - Don't! (boy crying) (crocodile hisses) - No. Joey. - Our son! - Joey! (Liza gasps) - Get me the rope, Liza, please. - Oh, Joe. (woman cries out) (Joey whimpers) - Grab it! Here. (woman whimpering) - Kevin, there. - [Kevin] Christ. - Joey. Oh Joey. - Mama. - (crying) Joey. - (gasps) Look! - Look! (suspenseful music) (woman whimpering) (Kevin and Liza cry out) (woman crying) - Are you all right? - Yes. (dramatic music) Oh my God. - Go get the dynamite, quickly. - Oh my God, it's coming this way! - Let's go! (woman gasps) - Oh my dear Lord. - You know what to do, go!
