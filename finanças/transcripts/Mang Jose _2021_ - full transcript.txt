But we encountered a slight problem. What is it? Calculating expenses. Calculating additional fees. Transportation expenses. Gasoline expenses. Food expenses. Plus value-added taxes. There. Okay. There you go. That’s already discounted. What is this? He’s asking what that is. This? A receipt, of course! Mang Jose’s services are not for free! Do you think it's free?! We helped you, so you pay us. Come on. What is this? Wait, wait. Are you Mang Jose? Mama told me to look for you. Your mom? Why? Is she a client of mine? No, but… Last night, she came home with two milk teas. She drank one and after that, I remember She drank it and transformed like she wasn’t herself. Okay, okay. We get it. Charlemagne, just bill him. Too chatty. He’s already in front of you! Why me? I’m the star of the show, right? Like I said! Just pay up and quit jabbering! Hold it, hold it. Mama didn’t mention anything about paying you. She just told me to find you. Why should I care? Who is your mother anyway? Tina Santos. Tina? Yes. Jose. Are you okay? Just forget about paying for now. You’re a first-time customer after all. This one is on us. Huh?! Are you kidding? You never do anything for free! Mang Jose, maybe you could help me. My mom has been taken! The Turbo Rats got your mom, too? Turbo Rats? Yes, Turbo Rats! Unfortunately, we’re booked. Very busy. If you need help maybe you can get it from your father. Or your grandpa! My stepdad is abroad. It’s just me and my mother here… Never mind. Leave it to me. I’ll help you. I’ll look for your mother. Good! So he’s helping you. You know what to do! Down payment? But I thought this was free, like you said. That was for the first favor. Can’t have freebies twice… you’re not kin! How about on installment basis? I have nothing on me. That’s fine. Forget it. What? Objections? Just what I was saying. Installment, five years. We'll go bankrupt because of you. They sighted another superhero, mamsh. In that tenement, Jerkoff Village, Dacac City it's a nice name of a place but our Turbo Rats couldn't handle! I’ll sashay over there myself! Oh well. I don’t want to resort to vulgar language but… like, you seem like shit? Anyway. Kwan! Kwan! And of course, Lando. our new Turbo Rat, Kwan. Go to that compound Lance was talking about. Go! Lance, stay for a bit. Happy. Sad. Happy. Sad. Do you know why the others are sad? They don’t have enough money, because it’s being stolen by the powerfuls. The business owners, the people in government, superheroes. Especially Mang Jose. While the world is run by the “haves” while there’s money, many will be sad. We want everyone to be happy, right? So, start by making good in your job, Lance. Boss, I don't feel good about this. Let's just come back tomorrow. This is not going to take long. Savior Charlemagne, keep watch here. Okay. - Where do we go, Tope? - This way. Why did we stop by again? They could catch us here. Obviously, to get the money to pay you with, right? Wait a sec, will paying you be even worth it? Of course! I'm great! What are your powers? My body absorbs every hit the enemy lands on me. I amass energy and I use that to hit back. The more I get hurt, the stronger my comeback. For real? Yeah. Sorry, I didn't mean to. Where do your powers come from? Were you like, bitten by a radioactive spider? Did a giant shooting star land on you? Did you swallow a stone by accident? Oh?! I don’t know what you’re on. I don't know about other superheroes. But as for me, I woke up like this. Woke up like this? What do you mean? I was born this way. Must be genetic. If it were all genetic, then the kids of superheroes are lucky. They have powers just like that. But wait a sec. If you have natural powers, what do you need an armor for? It just increases my power. On my own, I can multiply force twice. My armor multiplies it hundred-fold. That’s why your payment should be a hundred times more. Where is it? Don’t bother coming in. Tina, we really need the money. Christopher is growing fast. Then find a normal job! Why don’t you go back to being a security guard? You know it’s not enough. Not enough? Not enough for your philandering. You know very well we superheroes are in danger. How many times do I have to tell you that? Now, choose! Us? or your Mang Jose adventures? So you’ve been applying. Friendly and eloquent call center... Cut it out! How’s that going? Forget that. I don’t want to talk about it, it gets me down. It's like I won't be hired anyway. You give up so easily. Just keep on applying. You’ll eventually get a job. Fight. Okay. Ready? Ready. Let's go! Boss! Turbo Rats! Enemies approaching. Get ready. First Blood. You have slain an enemy. Double kill. Triple kill. Retreat. Too much expenses. Is there no elevator? Killing spree. You go ahead. Maniac. Savage. Did that hurt? Wiped out. Come, quick! Tope! Come here! Lando? Tope, let's go! Charlemage, let's go! Start the engine! Let's go! It won’t start! I’ll drive! - They're getting near! - Warning, enemies approaching. Enemies approaching. Show stealer extra! I'll rip your bangs off! Charlemagne! Fly, you fools! Mang Jose, aren't we gonna go back to save your manager? Too risky. Lance is there. This is what I'm afraid of. I can’t take you with me anymore on the mission. I’ll leave you in my house. Huh? You can’t. I have to find Ma. If you won’t take me, get off the jeep and I’ll go there on my own. But this is my jeep. That’s what I said! Fine, I’ll get off. What’s happening? Weren’t you getting off? Do you even know where you’re going? Where your mother was taken? No. No? Then shut up. Kwan, wake up. Not you. Her! Kwan! You look familiar. Tina? Mother King! Mang Jose got away from us, mamsh! How did that happen? Well, he was with a young cutie! Slightly yummy so I was a bit off my game! Send it to me. Send you a snap! Do you know them? Mang Jose! Mang Jose! So you’re a vlogger, huh?! Yes, ma’am. Tope is my son. Your son? And who’s the father? Mang Jose. So you guys got busy. You know, I have a child too same age as your son. If she were still alive. So. Tell me more. About Mang Jose. About Tope. Can I try? - You know how to use that? - Of course. Like this? Yes, but you can adjust the brightness. Whoa! Hey! Why’d you throw it out?! Are you stupid? We’ll be traced for sure! My Papa gave that to me! Papa? Isn’t he just your stepdad? It's the same thing. He has been a father to me. He wanted to bring me and Mama to Saudi with him. Chitchat— additional twenty percent on the bill. You just keep piling it on, don’t you! Where do you spend the money from your gigs, anyway? What else is your pay for? But to treat yourself with! Good food, little getaways, and of course for my drinking sprees! Sometimes I send it to my ex-wife. Ex? You have an ex-wife? It's all in the past. Where are we going again? We’re going to ask for help from my smartest friend. You have a friend? So far I’ve only seen you rack up enemies. Yes, I do. Just the one, in fact. Really? What happened to the others? I pushed them off this jeep while I'm driving. I thought we were looking for Mama. Just relax. Hickeytown Hotel Why are we here? Didn’t I tell you I had to see my friend. Here? For real? That’s what I said. Again, here? Are we doing this over and over? He hides out here. Besides, we need a break. We need to recharge. But, here? Really? Don’t worry, I won’t make moves on you. May I help you? Good evening. Good evening, sir. Five hours? Okay, sir. Let me check. Sir, we only have the executive room. That would be 599 pesos. Okay. Hey, this goes to your bill again, alright? Here you go. Room 312 Executive room. Okay, thank you. Sir, by the way, complimentary milk tea. Just take them. We’ll need those later. Great, thank you. Bye. Enjoy, Mother! Such a cutie you’ve got there. Winner! Of course. Mang Jose and Tope are here. Who are we visiting here, Mang Jose? You haven’t answered me that yet. Don’t worry. Me and this one are tight. Marcelo. Jose?! You shameless jerk! What do you need now? It’s an emergency. Emergency! You show up when you need something! And who’s that? I'm Tope. Tope. You’re Tina’s son? You know my mother? Of course! I stood as godfather-- Never mind. Come in! Come in! Let's go. Come in! A lot of people have tried this. I drink it everyday. Hold on, let me examine it. Are you also a superhero? No. Just helping out. So you also bill people? Of course not. I'm just helping. Marcelo, we need your intelligence. Yes. Because he hasn’t got it. Milk tea. Based on what I see, this milk tea has an entirely different composition. It contains a foreign organism, which reacts in perfect balance with the milk tea! And did you know that milk tea originated in Taiwan, but no one knows who thought of mixing and when-- Cut it out. We see your point. So who’s going to try this? I’ll drink. Marcelo, Tope. If something happens to me, the rest is up to you. I don't feel any-- Mang Jose? Seems okay to me-- Mang Jose. What are we gonna do? What's that? Wait! Based on what happened to you and your mom. I conclude that this milk tea has adverse effects only on superheroes. Hold on. Are you saying my mom is a superhero? Why? Didn’t you know? Marcelo! How will the effects wear off? The only way the effects of the milk tea could go away is for you to throw up. Like I did a while ago. You go now! Scram! You’ll blow my cover! What are we going to do, Mang Jose? I said, go now! You wussy little prick. Tope, hit me. On the head?! Really?! You said, "The more you get hurt, the stronger your comeback" right?! More hits. Wait. Just a little more! - Power at twenty percent. - More. That's good enough. Armor ready. - Rock and roll! - Combat systems activated. Come in! Hey, watch it! We've just had two minutes! Mang Jose, Mang Jose! - Excuse me, sir. - Yeah, that’s right. - Sorry, excuse us. - Power at fifty percent. Power at sixty percent. Group study?! Come on, Gen Zs! Wait, wait! Do that later. Let's go! I think you just gave the oldies a good time, idiot! You're old enough to call them sister. We know, Lord, that you will open all the doors in our lives. Amen? Classic moves! Tope! Mang Jose, duck! That was close! Tope. Mang Jose? You go ahead. Go! Boss. One-hit Combo now ready. Low power. Low power. Tope! Mang Jose! What's up? Nothin’ goin’? Low power. Low power. Just some bitch slappin’? Is that it? This is how you whip it, bitch! Ouchie?! Low on calcium, sweetie? You make great dumbbells! - Ouch! - Impact not detected. It’s starting to hurt. Boss, direct contact from enemy required. I get it, I get it! It’s not that easy, you know? Scarf attack! Pashmina! Pashneya slap! Schlap! Impact receptors missed. This bitch! Impact not counted. It tickles. Armor malfunction. Reset required. Power at twenty percent. Thought you could get an energy freebie, huh! Breakdance! Mang Jose. I think... my scarf suits you! Let’s go, hurry! What a pity! You’re a hottie! Let’s go, hurry! Lance. Let me guess. Mang Jose has escaped again? Even the young cutie pie, mamsh. The boy? The boy got away? From you? Can’t we just let them be? All the heroes are now our Turbo Rats! There are no more heroes! Aren’t we done with Phase one? On with Phase two, then! Let’s conquer the whole of the Philippines! The UN! The rest of the world. Isn’t that what you wanted? Yes! Yes! That’s exactly what I want! But I want more! And I can’t have more, if Mang Jose doesn’t fall into our hands. Who is that Mang Jose anyway? He has nothing on the other superheroes! 2005. My child was on her last breath. Crying. Because of her heart disease. Here comes Oprah again. Come on, Auntie. My child died of disease. - She died. - Super talk show. Because we didn’t have the money to have her treated. Mamsh, we were poor things then! We didn't even have our suits and powers! Did you forget? You wouldn’t understand how painful it is for a mother to lose her child because of poverty. I lost all happiness. Because of money. everyone else had the upper hand. - Yeah, right. Equality. - Because of money, Everyone's equal?! - Then, what?! - I lost everything, everyone had one over me. Everyone who had money edged me out. What do you think, Lance? Ouch! Mommy! Kill yourself, Lance. We can stop by and rest here. Won’t they catch up with us here? I don’t think so. They’re gone. Besides, I badly need to pee. No one really knows where Mother King came from. Daaamn? Dayyym? What’s that? So you superheroes were wiped out by Mother King, not by humankind, right? I think you now know too much. Mama told me that bedtime story over and over. Every night she would tell it to me without fail, so I know all about those things. Can you imagine? She’s been a superhero all this time. She never told me. She was right to keep it from you. It was for your own good, for your own safety. It just makes me wonder if my deadbeat father was also a superhero. Because if he were… What if he were one? That makes him an asshole. This couldn’t have happened to Mama and I. He would be there to protect us. You know what, kid? You need to learn self-defense. I saw you fight back there. You have it in you! But you look like you need some practice. You tend to go headlong into it. Mama hates it when I get into fights, though. Fighting is different from self-defense. You have a point. Let’s do this. I told you to relax. ♪ When the night comes on, ♪ ♪ he arrives, bringing doom ♪ Breathe in through the nose. Exhale through the mouth. Mang Jose. I need to fart. ♪ He’s fighting my fight for me! ♪ Yuck! ♪ Mang Jose. ♪ ♪ The superhero you can rent ♪ So, if you know my mom, is it possible that we’ve already met? You were really young when I left her. What did you say? Nothing, I said that’ll do. Ah. That'll do. Okay. The best offense is defense. Your power could come from an emotional, not a physical core. Breathe in through the nose. Exhale through the mouth. When you gain control of yourself, you’re in control of the situation. ♪ Help! Help! ♪ ♪ Somebody help! ♪ You're slowing down, old man. Nice, nice. Okay? Okay! ♪ Mang Jose. ♪ ♪ Mang Jose. ♪ ♪ The superhero you can rent. ♪ I can do it! I can do it! Lead me to Mother King! Mang Jose, can I ask you something? but don't get offended. I just don’t get you. Why do you always ask for payment? My wife had a delicate pregnancy. All I knew was to be Mang Jose. I thought it wouldn’t be so bad to charge for my services. I didn't tell your mom-- my ex-wife. She was furious when she found out, and threw me out. Just about right. To be real, superheroes aren’t supposed to be… paid? Yeah? Mang Jose, does your child know you? No, sadly. Why don’t you introduce yourself? He’s better off not knowing me. I worry he might take after me. The way I see it, it was a good thing Mama got a boyfriend because even if he’s always abroad, at least I have a father figure somehow. Son? Huh? Son of a... You better take it easy with that. I bet your ex-wife threw you out because of your drinking as well. Would I make a good father to you? Huh? I mean, let’s just say Would you find me okay as a father? I don't know. But I find you okay as a comedian! I bet you’re just hungry. Probably. Alright, I got this. Damn, you were so close to saying it! Would you like anything, sir? Can I get… How do I say this? Tope, try not to faint. I am your father. No, it has to be cool. Yo son, who’s yo daddy? Lame. Let’s do Fast Talk! Tina, the nagging superhero, here’s your question. Coffee or tea? Peace Tea. Boyfriend or husband? Peace Tea. Superhero or supervillain? Peace Tea. No, it needs to be easy for him to understand. Luke, I am your father. Peace Tea, the answer to everything. Peace Tea. Superior in taste. For all. Tope! For all. Peace Tea. The answer to everything. Peace Tea. Superior in taste. For all. Peace Tea. Tope. Breathe in through the nose, exhale through the mouth. What happened? Just relax. Did that blast come from me? Wait, why are we going back? I’m taking you home. I’m finishing this mission. Hold up. Are we discussing this again? Didn’t we agree that we’re finding Mama? Why are you suddenly taking me home again? Didn’t you see? You can’t control your powers yet. Get over yourself! My powers are physical. Yours are emotional. We’re both going to end up in trouble. I have powers now! I can really save Mama! You’ve seen what they did to her on TV, right?! And now you’re telling me to step back?! You’re taking me home after everything we’ve been through? What are you, some sort of coward?! You really are out of it, aren’t you! Don’t you get it? I don’t want you to be in danger! What the hell are you talking about? Where is all this coming from? I don’t care! I’m paying you! Isn’t that what matters to you?! That’s all you ever think about! Who are you to tell me what to do, you’re not my father! Yes, I am! Shit. Tope, sorry. I’ve wanted to tell you for so long but I didn’t know how. Your mom, I’m trying to protect you both. Superheroes are in danger. Tope, I want you to understand. Tope! I wanted to tell you. But I couldn't find the right timing! Timing? Well, nice timing, congratulations! Pa? Screw you. Son of a bitch, watch your mouth! You should be thankful I'm owning up to it! I didn’t have to! It's not like I would've gotten anything out of you! And what could I have gotten out of it, too? I got nothing from you my whole life! Don’t forget, I’m a superhero. Bravo! Such a superhero! Saving countless lives! But you can’t even show your face to your own son! That’s your mother’s fault! My mother? Mama has been there all along! Mama was there when I was looking for you! She was there on my graduation day! She was there when I came home beaten to a pulp! Mama was there when I was circumcised! Really?! You're circumcised?! You really are an asshole. I don’t need you. Don’t you dare turn your back-- This? This is what you live for, right? You're paid. Don’t show your face to me again or I might end up billing you for all those years. Freakin’ empty. Ma? Ma! Charlemagne? Charlemagne? Mang Jose. Mother King! Tina and Tope are asking about you. You Motherfuc... King! I'm indeed Mother King. I’ll have you fetched. Don't run away, if you want to see your family alive. I’ll wait here. Okay! You guys are already here? You're fast. Did you use Waze? Oh my gosh. I haven’t hooked this one yet. He’s not easy to convert into a Turbo Rat. Strong. Hi. Who are you? Mother King. Mother King yourself. Are you calling me names? Well, you started it. When? When? Ma? Ma? Where’s Ma?! Ma? Ma! Oh, she's right here. Your mom is now a Turbo Rat. She's one of my Kwans now. Where's Mother King! What's that smell? It stinks here! Mother King! Oh. Finally, you're here! You gave me the hardest time among all superheroes. What do you have against me?! Why are you doing this to me? Have you forgotten? How easily you forget! What a pity. What a pity. Hold it. I think I know your face. I remember! You were my client! Forgive me. Forgive me. Cut it out! This is turning into a musical! Let’s clear things up, shall we? Did we ever hook up? Of course not! You think you’re hot stuff? You’re nothing to me. Yuck! I won’t hit that. Your nose is too big. Why you little Chucky doll of a Mother King! Tope! Kill Mang Jose. Tope! Mang Jose. Get out of here! Mother King! Please stop! Kill the father who abandoned you. Who wanted nothing else but to be a superhero! Kill your deadbeat father. You animal! Tope! Control.

Not as long as you worship money! Why? Who should I be worshipping? You?! I'm a better option than you. You’re worth nothing. All you know is to be a superhero!
