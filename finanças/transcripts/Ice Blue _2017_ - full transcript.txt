Morning Arielle. Hi Dad. Close your eyes. I'm off to the pond. OK. You OK? Uh huh, slow pokey. My little baby. I'll see you in a minute. OK. Love you. Love you. ♪ Oh the shark has pretty teeth dear ♪ ♪ And he keeps them pearly white ♪ ♪ Just a ♪ OK. I had to hide it from Arielle. These things are like family to her. Just a wee kid. Well I might have something leeching into my water killing off my stock. Uh huh. It's already been a tough year for the business. Water tests should tell us everything. But how hard can a beaver autopsy be? ♪ Oh the line forms on the right babe ♪ ♪ Now that Macky's back in town ♪ These clouds are. Good morning. Goats love show tunes. I beg your pardon? Nothing. Here, eggs and your milk. Were you wanting cheese today? I've got fresh curds. Another time, perhaps. Christian. My nephew, Christian. He's staying with me for, well, we'll see. Your father at the house? I'll just go pay him. We have another matter to discuss. You two talk. Wanna see a dead raccoon? How'd it die? Well sir, that's the mystery. Sir? You're weird. My aunt says you're home schooled. So what's wrong with you? Hello? Jonathan? I have your payment for this week's dairy. Thank you. Was there anything else? I'm a touch embarrassed to say, I had a bit of a spill out there, on your walkway. I'm sorry. Where's it hurt? Yeah. That seems OK. Just OK? She's occupied. I'm sorry. I'll be sure to salt the driveway more diligently. So why are you here? Where'd you come from? I traveled through time and space and risked life and limb to be here right now with you. The city. Pushed my mom to the brink, and then I was sent to Auntie Liz's scared straight farm, or whatnot, for delinquents. You know the girls at school, they aren't like you. What are they like? Manufactured, plastic, digitized. You're weird. Tell me to stop then. St-. Ugh. I'll leave a light on for you, in case you change your mind. You've been alone a long time, Jon. We both have. Jon. Christian, are you OK? Nepal. Bouton. No, listen to me, George Leigh Mallory. First discovered on the Everest expedition. It's Nepal, I'm telling you. Bet me. Name it. Chicken coup cleaning. Deal, two weeks. A month. Flickered out, Daddio? Nope. Oh, hmmmm. You are correct, Arielle, and I was wrong. Next time though, sweetie, always get a handshake on bets. Ow. Hi ya! Hi ya! You know there's still time to pull together a party for you. It's fine, Dad. Yeah, but it's your sweet sixteen. If you say sweet sixteen one more time, you are gonna get a karate chop. Alright, I think I learned my lesson there. So what's this Christian boy like? Dark. Something out of a detective novel. Smells nice enough though. Did something happen? No. We're always straight with each other. I know, Dad. Not about this, please don't make me. I'd never make you. OK, good, because I cannot talk about this with you. You can't talk to me about the nothing that didn't happen? Correct. Chuck's not ready. We shouldn't have brought him. Chuck, Chuck will be fine. Look at his eyes. Tell me with a clear conscience he looks fine. You're a caring soul. They're not pets, they're workers. They work for us. They're our livelihood. Let's go. Chuck, take care of Dorisa. You're not gonna fall in. Arielle, you're not gonna fall in. Sweetie, one of the new babies, he didn't make it. Is that why the biologist guy? Yeah. I want to see Mom for my birthday. That's what I want. You have a way to get a hold of her, right? Yeah, I think so. You know, last time we tried that. Yeah, I know, she bailed. Whatever, that was years ago. I really want to see her, Dad. You sure? I need you to try. Sure. I need to take a run over to Mr. Dhaliwal's farm. I'll be back before you're asleep. Arielle, please, it was just a nightmare. No, it was different this time, there was a creepy little girl. Creepy little girl, scary old lady, crazy mime. No. You're not taking me seriously. Look, I know what this is about. I know you don't like being alone. That's not true. After dark. I'll be back before dark. ♪ Lots of people gather round, here the goat remains ♪ Ugh, God, come on. See you later, Jon. Ah. Ugh. Jeez. Sweetie, you there? Sweetie, you there? Happy Daddio, what's the hold up? I'm stuck in a white out, I might be a minute. What, are you OK? Sweetie, can you hear me? Piece of crap. Piece of junk. Hi, you've reached Jonathan Ens at MAJ Farms. Dad? Christian, go away, leave me alone. ♪ Cause Mackie's back ♪ Surprise. Happy sixteenth birthday. My darling Arielle. Come on, long lost mother shows up on your sixteenth birthday, that's like something out of a storybook. I was under the impression you asked for me to be here. Dad got a hold of you. Was he not supposed to? Thanks for coming. I wouldn't have missed it for the world. I got three stitches right there. Ouch. Yeah, that's a good one. OK, and then I got kicked by a horse right here. And then, you check this scar out on my back. That is very impressive dear, OK, you've been busy. Klutzy. You get that from me. Do I? There will be plenty of time to answer every one of your million trillion questions. But for now, just one. Where have you been? Almost everywhere. Did you miss me? That's two. Mom. So much you don't even know. So you had a boyfriend? Ha, no! No? No. Well, I almost, there's this boy but he's not very right for me. Why? He's trouble. Trouble, isn't that what being a teenager's all about? What's he like? Intense. Confident. I'm pretty sure he left a dead racoon on the porch. I beg your pardon? He did what? I should try Dad again on the CB and see if he's OK. I wish you wouldn't. Why not? Try and understand, OK? This is a lot. But he should know you're here. I know, I'm just, I'm not ready to see him, OK? I thought I was, but being here, baby steps, OK? OK. OK. But wait, Mom, you just got here. Yeah, no, I got a hotel room nearby in Fairview. I'm not going anywhere. I will see you again soon. I promise. OK Mom. Thanks. This was nice. I love you my dear. So, so much. Happy Birthday. Thanks. I love you too. So cake for breakfast, is it everything you hoped for? You getting home safely, that was the best gift of all. Yeah, so weird, snow kicking up like that. And you here alone at night, and you survived. How'd you do it? Just kept busy I guess. I'll get it, you stay. You sure? Uh huh. I'm sorry I couldn't give you everything you asked for. Your mother, I tried, I really did. Her number's not in service anymore, I sent some emails, no answer. That's OK Dad. What, how did you know which room? I didn't. Let's go out. You're asking me out now? Right now. And do what? OK, there's these kids at school and they hang out at this vacant lot and drink alcoholic liquor and indulge in youthful rebellion, so let's steal their booze and set something on fire. Yeah, I think you left a gift on my porch last night. I didn't want you to forget about me, and jewelry is just so gouache, don't you agree? What is your most immediate problem? You not getting ready and not coming out with me, come on. I can't just leave, my Dad is. If my aunt catches me I'm straight off to juvie, so you see what I'm risking for you? I promise I'll bring you back safe and sound. Oh my God. New guy. I told them you'd come. Hey Deb, how are you? I'm Bronwyn. I know, this is. Hey, you need to meet my man Jay. He's got that busted motorcycle you said you could fix up, remember? Hey, you came with Christian right? He's pretty God damn hot, and nice, score. I'm Hailey, or Hales, or Hey. I know you. From where? I'm Arielle Ens. We were on the curling team together. Oh my God, that was like forever ago. Hi. Are you still being home schooled? Does it like suck? I'm super buzzed on this maple cough syrup punch that Bronwyn made, it is sick as thieves. Do you want some? Bronnie, get over here you dumb bitch. She's my BFF. This is Arielle. I know who you are. Do you know who I am? I'm Tim Bateman's daughter. OK, I don't know him. Yeah, well your Mom knew him. Excuse me. Your mom knew my dad, like on her back knew him. It was her mom. I swear I don't know what you're. You need to get out of here seconds ago. I don't know. Too late. I'll wreck you. Ha ha! I shouldn't have left you alone back there. I'm sorry. Hey, what are you doing? My mom and I, we used to write music and sing. It calms me. Cool, yeah. I play a little harmonica. Oh that's great, we should start a band. I really don't care right now. That's fair. That girl said my mom and her dad. Forget what she said, she's a soulless wannabe bar star. Where is your mom? She. She moved away. A long time ago. She wasn't, she wasn't good at the mom stuff. She was an artist, a photographer, musician, traveled a lot. Even if, if that went down, it's got nothing to do with you, OK? Hey, Arielle. Shit. Who's the girl? Who was the girl? Calling the cops was a bit extreme. You can't even grasp how worried. Why did you go out? Because he wanted me to. No boy ever looked at me like that. OK. OK, regardless I'm still gonna have to. Punish me, ground me, whatever. I know. I'm sorry. I'm so grateful that you're safe. If anything ever happened to you. I can't even imagine. Come on, it's freezing out here. So, how in shit are you? I can't see you anymore. Did he say that? I'm saying it. I can't. I can't do that to him again. But that doesn't mean that we can't. I can't trust being around you. I'm not myself. Maybe you are. Afternoon. That'll be $4.50. And 50 cents is your change. You have a good day now. Thank you. Tim Bateman, is he the owner? I suppose. Is he here? Could I talk to him quickly? Sweetheart, Tim's my husband. Passed away some time ago. What was it? I made a mistake, sorry. Who are you? I'm sorry. Hey, perfect timing. Can we go? I have homework. Where's your lady stuff? They were out. Oh, are you kidding me? What is it? It's a joke. Before you say anything What are you doing? Let me out, you psycho. I didn't want to spook you, but I thought this was the only way. I'm sorry we got pulled over, but I don't understand why we can't, I mean, I really, really like you. No, you don't, you don't like me, OK? The hell I don't. No, I'm a novelty, I'm a weird homeschool shut in chick. Not to me you're not. Oh yeah, what do you like about me then? You just stepped over the raccoon. What? You wanted to scream and flail and freak out. You watched me, are you insane? But you couldn't let me win, and that moment I loved you. Yeah, I was watching you. I can't not. How long have you been in here? I figured farmers get up early. God, you're an idiot, we need to get you out. Not until you agree to go out with me. That is the hypothermia talking. I'm not leaving until you say yes, that's it, so my life's in your. Bluff called. It's the goat's. God, Dad, you always do that. Sorry. Just had a little accident. Lunch in 15. Yeah, I know. I just wanted to, we never actually had the talk. Seriously? Well. Dad, I'm eating stew over here. You and the Glancer boy. Christian? Are you and him? We had a very heavy make out session in the cooler, yeah. OK. Always be straight, right? Right. Well he's the reason that you got in trouble. Dad, he made a huge romantic gesture and risked freezing to death just to see me, what am I supposed to do, not make out with him in the cooler? The boy is dangerous, I just don't want to see you make a huge mistake. Isn't that what being a teenager's all about? And can we avoid the talk, because I know about the birds and the bees and the condoms and the trees. The what? Nothing, it's just a clever rhyme, Dad, let it go. OK. Ever heard of beaver farming? I mean farming isn't really accurate. We breed them. Loan or sell them to customers who want their creek dammed on their property, stuff like that. I can't imagine living out here, just so out of the loop with the rest of the world. Why are you here, Hailey? Bronwyn found out you were at her family's store, you were snooping around about her dad. God. So she's super pissed. Like wants to kill you pissed. Why? I don't understand. Why do you think your mom left? My dad said it was some kind of a breakdown, their marriage wasn't great, she missed city life, traveling. Tell me what you know, please. Doesn't have to be a race. Arielle might be back soon. She'll ask questions. And would it be the worst thing in the world, if you tell her the truth. Douglas is dead. Four and a half years. I know. The other day at your place when I slipped on the ice, that was the day I decided. Decided what? That it was time to stop sulking in the past. I'm glad you're over it. I've really got to go. You can talk to me. About her. Your wife. Why would I want to do that? Hey there, Mr. Ans. Dropping off more dairy product, were you? Stay away from her. Tell you what Dad, I'll stay away from her, if you tell her. I'm around like what, a week? It's amazing how many people just offer shit up about you. Weird loner, wife ran off. Keeps his daughter locked up. Gotta let her go, Dad. Sooner or later. So it's true. My mom and Bronwyn's dad were sleeping together. And then she broke it off, so that's why Mr. Bateman, you know, killed himself. He couldn't take it, not being with her. Is this what the whole town thinks? Could be bullshit though, right? I mean, so long ago. He's dead, and your mom's not here, so, who knows. My advice, just forget about it. Look forward, life's too short. Yeah. Thank you Hailey, for being so nice to me. Avoid town, OK? OK? I mean Bronwyn's my best friend and all, but she's crazy, straight up. Yeah, kids no good. Anything you can tell me about him. Yeah, well how do you want me to make it up to you? Yeah, I read your ticket. Well, I guess that I am going to have to plead guilty and hope for mercy from the court. Yeah. Yeah, that could be arranged. Hey. My precious girl. How much time do we have? We have a few hours, he's just in Neville helping a client. OK. Where did you park? Just up the road. It's safe. I don't like all this, it's like I'm lying to him. We don't do that to one another. I know it's hard, and I appreciate your trust. So dad did get a hold of you to say that I wanted to see you. That's right. He told me he didn't. Hm, well that's. Why would he say that, do you think? This is your father's house. I don't want to disparage. Oh my God, why is everyone pussyfooting around me about everything? What do you want me to say? He gets forgetful when he drinks. Drinks? Dad? Do we really have to do all this unpleasant business now? So what are you trying to tell me, that my father's like a secret drunk? Is that what you're trying to say? All I'm saying is that when you were younger, the second after your head hit the pillow he'd be in the bottle or at the bar. I don't believe you. If he's gotten help, that's great. Did you have an affair? Yes. And that's why you left? What did he tell you? He didn't, but apparently the whole town knows. Everything changed when your father and I got married. Before that, we talked travel, seeing the world. And then, all he wanted was to keep me here. I was miserable. Then you came along, things were better for a while, but Tim Bateman and I, we fell hard for each other. You loved him more than Dad. But you ended things. After everyone in town found out, I humiliated your father. Tim's family. I tried to make things right with your dad, I went back to him. But Tim, he couldn't take it. They found him in his garage with the engine still running. And who was to blame? Is that your piece of crap parked over there? Hello. You've got 30 seconds or I tow your hunk of junk. That's my big crime against my humanity, is it? Because I have a crowbar in my trunk if you want to smash out my tail lights. You're on a tight leash while you're visiting here, Mr. Ross, remember that. Huh, you know my name already. Probably from the other night when you pulled me and Arielle over. You're on parole. It's my business to know you. One more slip and it's back to the city and straight into juvenile detention. You want that? Is this his idea, her dad? Did he ask you for a favor? Or maybe you guys do each other favors. She's a good girl. We all want her to stay that way. Really? Because from what I hear, she's not even allowed off the compound. Farm. Tell me three things about her. Three. Her name's Arielle, I'll give you that one. Come on constable, two more. Anything? So I'm gonna go now. You'll go when I say you can go. He's boning my aunt by the way, rather loudly. That old dress of mine, the red one with the lace, you would look so pretty in that, with your hair done like this. What dress? There's an old box of dresses up in the attic. I told your father to let you have them when you got a little older. They'd all fit you now. Let's see. You look so pretty. So grown up. Thank you for telling me all that. You are a rare treasure, thanking me for being the world's worst mother. Sometimes I feel like I'm missing some pieces of my life. Hey, take a look around. There is so much more than this. There's a whole world out there, and I hope you get to see it. Why wouldn't I? I'll see you soon. OK. Hey pal. Yeah. OK. Yeah, no, I can handle it. Thanks Wendel. I appreciate the offer though. OK pal. Yeah. What are you doing? The one that died tested positive for an infectious disease. You're gonna murder them without telling me? I thought it would be easier if you didn't know. For who, for you? The water is toxic, do you want them to suffer? There has to be another way. Well there isn't. You shouldn't have got so attached. Go back up to the house. It'll be quick. Go! You don't want to see this. Arielle? He killed them, right in front of me. OK, you just let it out now. You let it out. What is it sweetheart? Why are you here? I'm here because you asked for me to be here. I am here for you, and that is all that matters. Maybe you're ready. Maybe you're ready to hear about the past. About the lies. What lies, you left. About the accident. What accident? Sweetheart, you drowned. Right here. You were five. Five years old. The farm was struggling. I had to pick up a job in town, at the drug store. That left your father to take care of you. He tried his best, but that unhappiness inside of him, it caused him to drink, it caused him to go inside of himself. Your little heart, it stopped for nine minutes. I thought we lost you. And then a miracle happened. And my prayers were answered, and I made a promise, I made a promise that I would stay and I would be with your father, and I promised to be the best mother that I could be. Then the affair got out, and Tim, he killed himself. And your father, he sent me away, Arielle. Do you understand? He sent me away. And I am so sorry that you were never told the truth, and that I didn't have the courage to take you with me. You need to get out of here, Arielle. This place is killing you. I can't leave. He'll destroy you. He will never let you leave. He will always find a reason. And you, you're a kind hearted girl and you will take his orders, and then one day you'll wake up. I'm not leaving again, I'm not leaving until you're ready to leave. ♪ I ♪ ♪ Could stay ♪ ♪ I ♪ ♪ Walked away ♪ ♪ Who am I? ♪ How did you know which window was mine? I didn't.

I never want there to be secrets like that between us. Me neither. Six months ago I beat up this random kid, and he turned out to be like, you know, mentally handicapped. It was a stupid initiation thing, and I broke his collarbone, and he now has permanent hearing loss in one of his ears. And the guys who dared me to do it, I didn't even like all that much, I was just bored, alone. And those assholes, they picked him out, they knew he was, you know. And they thought I did too, or they thought maybe I wouldn't go through with it, or I don't know what they thought. I hurt him, so bad. It's the worst thing I've ever done. There was, at my sentencing I was given a chance to say something, to apologize, and I couldn't, because saying I'm sorry would just be words, and it's too late, because he's even more messed up now. That's, I wanted to tell you, that's it. I don't deserve anything good. I, I'm sorry. When it comes to Arielle, I get. I feel horrible about scaring you. Can you forgive me? I saw your light on, and I thought that was your way of saying that you forgave me. OK, I see that I have some work to do here. It's just been a while since I've been in a relationship. That's what this is to you? Well, yeah, yeah. I mean, I I like you. John, I went to the police station this evening to file assault charges against you. The officer who took my statement, such a lovely young woman. Such a kind soul, a Constable Ruth Shocka. Are you familiar John, with Constable Ruth Shocka? Because she seems very familiar with you. I dare say she may loathe you even more than I loathe you. After learning of your familiarity with Constable Ruth Shocka, I withdrew my complaint. It dawned on me how sad your existence is. How isolated you are, secretive. Sad, really. But let me be clear. Stay away from me, or else I or Constable Ruth Shocka will destroy you. Pathetic louche. And that is not for you. Can I talk to you for a second? I'm so sorry about your dad. I didn't know. I didn't know anything. I hate that my family caused you pain. That's it. I'm so sorry, Bronwyn. You don't ever talk about him, you hear me? Never! Told you we weren't finished. Blindsided Arielle. Hit her in the back of a head with a bottle, and she was just defending herself, and then it got crazy, so crazy. You have been told repeatedly to stay away from her. All I did was break them up. There was underage drinking, drugs on the premises, which is undoubtedly a violation of your parole. Fine, you know, call my PO, send me back to juvie, get me out of the sticks, I'm sick of this place. What's gonna happen to her? She'll be charged. Still a minor, first offense, community service. I thought she was all, you know, proper and normal. I had no idea. It was so messed up. You can't help her. All she's ever known is this one kind of life. Lonely existence, until she finally gets away from. Maybe that's what needs to happen, maybe somebody needs to get her the hell off that farm. Maybe. But that won't be easy. Her father just bailed her out. We should get you checked out. I mean, you might have a concussion. Like you know anything. Morning. You look back to normal. You feeling OK? Goats are dry. No milk. That's strange. I'm leaving. What? I'm finishing today's chores, and then that's it, I'm going. Where? With Christian? No, no I don't think so Arielle. You don't get to decide. What the hell happened to you last night? You put that girl in the hospital. Her dad was having an affair with mom, but I don't need to tell you that. All this talk about your mother. You're just not even going to respond to that. So she got into you somehow. No. I'm your father and I love you, but you belong here. You don't get to keep her from me. Not anymore. You know I had to. Why? She was sick. She loved you, but something inside her changed. It changed in her heart. Her heart just got darker and darker. No little girl should ever be separated from her mother, except this time. This time it had to happen. I had to send her away. Arielle. I lied to you. I didn't look for her. I never sent emails, I never called. I didn't try. I never intended to. Why? Because your mother's dead. She took her own life. She drowned. Right there in the pond. She drove her car into it, so. Arielle. No. You don't come near me. She told me about the clothes in the attic. She braided my. Arielle, you were having nightmares. No, I brought her back. Come here. Come here, come here. Oh, I love you. I love you. And as hard as it is to hear, you're better off without her. Ugh. Arielle. Open the door. Arielle, please. Hey. Hey! Stop. Stop. Hi honey. Hi. You. Yes, yes, I did miss our intellectually stimulating conversations. You know, you always did have a way with words. She turned out beautifully, Jon, our little Arielle. Bright, articulate, an old caring soul. Just like her mother. You've lost her, Jon. She's leaving you. You're gonna die alone here on this disgusting, stench-laden, life sucking farm. You're gonna die alone with your farm animals, and your whores, and your nothing. And your daughter will be happy. She'll step foot off of this prison, and never ever return. I told you we weren't finished. This isn't happening. You're not here. Because? Because your rotting corpse is at the bottom of that pond, because I put you there. Sweetheart. Sweetheart, you were in danger. You put me in danger. I almost died. Oh baby, that's not what happened. That's not what happened. I don't know what she told you. I don't know what she told you baby. You're not gonna hurt us anymore. She tried to kill you. She buckled you into a car, and she pushed you in. She tried to kill you. She pushed you, baby, I tried to save you. She buckled you into a- I told him we weren't finished yet. What is wrong with you? We're not finished yet. You sure this is what you want? So beautiful. I'm gonna miss it. We should go. You sure? Yeah, yeah. You know where you want to go yet? Which direction are we driving? South. South sounds heavenly, sir.
