November, 1967, Cypress Gardens Restaurant, Queens, New York. The victims... Thomas D'Angelo, James D'Angelo, Frank Terelli... condemned and executed in a bloody, four-year Mafia War between the board of directors of organized crime... known as The Commission... and Joseph Bonnano... boss of a powerful, 300-man organization... who, at the age of 26, emerged as the youngest Don in the National Brotherhood of the Mafia. His son... Salvatore Bonnano... in honoring his father, became part of that war. This is his story. Hey, Cowboy! You look great. That Arizona weather really goes with you. You got a nice tan and all. Hey, give me the suitcase. Hey, let me carry that. Good to see you, Bill. Have a good flight? Where's the car? Out front. What do you hear from my father? I was talking to him day before yesterday. He's been moving around, but he says he'll get in touch. 45 minutes after landing in New York, Salvatore "Bill" Bonnano, along with two captains in his father's organization, arrive at the Long Island estate of Joseph Magliocco... the new boss of the Profaci family and longtime friend and ally of the Bonnanos. The historic bond between these two organizations had been further strengthened by the marriage of Bill Bonnano to Rosalie Profaci in 1956. How do you like this guy, yeah? Why you bring them, Bill? This is family. They're family, too. Everybody here? Everybody. Is my wife coming with me or not? Course she's coming with you. Because if she's not coming... Hey, why do you talk so silly for? Do I or do I not have a right to my own wife? Nobody says you don't have a right. Does he have the right to kill my daughter with heartache? We are Profacis, Mister. And nobody does that to us! I'm a-warning you, if you hurt my daughter anymore... You, what are you talking about? He knows what I'm talking about. What is he doing here if he don't love her, huh? Mistake. Young people. Young people make mistake. They're together now! That's what's important. Oh. Everybody agreed, huh? Hey, Bill. No more trouble, eh? And you... now... Go! I'm sorry, mama. Oh, Bill. Oh... You're the best, Bill. You pregnant? Hey, look at the baby, eh? He got big, huh? Hello? Let me see how tall you got. Bill, it's your father. Bill's father had been underground for months avoiding government subpoenas and hiding from rival Dons who suspected him of plotting takeovers within the organization. Despite warnings from the Commission led by Stefano Magaddino, Joseph Bonnano decided to go his own way. His defiance of the Mafia high command had begun to affect the loyalty of his own family, even among the men closest to him. How are you? You look fine, Salvatore. Very fine. You don't say hello? Hey, Gaspare, how are ya? Hey, look at this guy. If this is what the desert does for you, I'm moving right now. How are ya, Bill? I'm OK. We must talk. Get the coffee. Half an hour. Everything's OK with Rosalie? And the girl you've been fooling around with? That's finished, Pop. Rosie and I talked it over. We worked it out. Oh, we're going to sell the house in Phoenix. We're gonna move here now. My Uncle says we can stay with him until we get a new place. Good. Very good. What's happening, Pop? Sit down. I got big trouble with the federal investigation. They been chasing me all over the country with the subpoenas. And that ain't enough. Magaddino... yes, Magaddino... is trying to push me out of the Commission. The rest, they just sit at the table. Not a word. They want me to come in for a meeting. But Magaddino doesn't want to talk. He wants to shoot. So I thought I'd tell you this because you've got to be careful now. There is a big push here. You watch out. Not just from them... from our own. Who? I don't know. Gaspare, I think. He's been with you since the beginning. Like this arm. This... hmm! One thing you must know, Salvatore, one thing you must remember... Magaddino wants to break up my family, kill it. Gaspare is his brother-in-law. No matter what... blood is blood. You watch out for him. You remember that, hm. Careful. What's it gonna be? A girl. How can you tell? Feels that way. You go around feeling it all day? No. But I can tell. I can tell. Is it true women feel sexiest when they're pregnant? Where you going? Come here. Let me get... take this thing off. What's gonna happen with your father? Is everything gonna be all right? Everything's gonna be fine, just fine. What's that for? I got something working here. But nowadays you don't know who you can trust. Mr. Magliocco. Hello, Bill. Everything all right? Yes, everything's been taken care of. OK. You know what you have to do. Let's go home. What's all that about? Well, it's a shame your father's having all this trouble with Magaddino. But you know, Bill, our family's been together a long time. Since Sicily. Your father and me... we gotta help each other now. What are you talking about? Let's go. Two months later, the significance of this event was the topic of discussion at a meeting of the Commission in which Sam DeCavalcante... self-appointed peacemaker and go-between... tried to hold back the mounting forces of war. Mr. Magaddino, please. Let me talk to Bonnano just once more before you make the vote. You've been talking to him for a year now. He never come in. Thank you, sir. Thank you. I... I gotta talk to Bill. Everybody out, please. Everybody out. Go, go call the doctor. Close the door. Bill, I've gotta talk to you. Sit down. Take it easy, Uncle Joe. Take it easy. No, I've gotta tell you. Look Bill. I had it all set up to hit Magaddino. But my own man tipped him off. You remember the day you drove me to the cemetery, that guy? They bought him. It's all out in the open now. What else do we need? Bonnano and Magliocco try to hit me. You tell me there... why? Why? So he can be the Boss of all the Bosses. He even sent for his college kid from Arizona to help him. First thing you know, the kid was seen with Magliocco in the car while he's making a contract. They'll think I'm in on it. Who? Me and my father! No, no Bill. I took the whole blame. They're not going to believe you. You know the way they are! Oh, dear! Why did you do it? Huh? Why did you do it? What made you do something like that? Perfect setup. While the kid takes care of the family, Bonnano's free to move around and signal black flags all over the world. Even try to grab some action in Canada... my territory. This guy's got a big appetite. How long are you going to keep feeding it? All right. We vote. Easy, easy, Uncle Joe. Easy, easy. Everything's gonna be all right. Nice and easy. Joe Bonnano is no longer a member of this Commission. He loses his family. We get a new boss for his people. House of Banana. With the death of Magliocco, and the removal of Joseph Bonnano from the Commission and from the head of his own family, the way was open for Gaspare DeGregorio to make his bid for power. Such a man. Such strength. What's there to understand? We all gotta die sooner or later. Even you. Listen, I gotta take care of a couple things in town. I'll see you later, huh? That guy's always got something to take care of. A busy man these days. I see you've got your escorts, huh? Ever since Vellachi spilled their guts, I'm protected. They're city-paid bodyguards. Listen, Mari. Are we all in agreement? Gaspare here will take over the Banana family. He has our support and protection. Make sure everybody understand that. Any Banana people as don't come in with Gaspare, they're marked. We start with his numbers people. And then we take his union boys. Step on 'em. Squeeze 'em. Capiche? Hello, Officer. Nice day, ain't it? Nice. Nice sunshine. You should go out and take a walk. It's good exercise. Nice, nice fellas. What's going on here? Little insurance, Sam. From me? Sam, I respect you. You got good intentions. But I don't think you understand this thing all the way. OK, I'm here. Now you talk. Don Pepino. There's gonna be blood... lots of blood... if you don't straighten this thing out. For 30 years the Commission didn't come between a Boss and his family. Now they tell the world that Gaspare DeGregorio is the boss here. And me? Me? I have nothing. There is no Commission. Only Magaddino speaks. Everybody else is afraid to talk. But this is my family. My business! But if you could just get it straight about the hit! What hit? What hit? Am I responsible for what Magliocco did? If they have proof, let them speak it. Let them show it. No, Sam. Magaddino makes a big stink so I have to come in and talk to them. And what do I find when I come? I find my death. But Don Pepino, you don't understand. Sam, save your breath. But there's going to be war. Finito! Goodbye, Sam. Sam? I like you. Whatever happens, don't get caught between. Sam is right. There could be a war. Get our people ready. I want you off the street. Spread out, disappear. Wait for Magaddino's hole. What about Gaspare? We hit him? It ain't his fault. Magaddino is just using him. Gaspare, Gaspare, what are you doing? OK. We go. Salvatore, listen. I've got to keep moving around. It's up to you to hold things together. Understand? Think everything out. Each one in the family... their life is in your hands. Remember that. Frank, you take care of him. All right. Now give your daddy a big hug. I'll call you when I get a chance. Take care, huh? Remember to tell the gardener not to cut the hedges no more than a foot high. Oh yeah, call the electrician. Tell him I want flood lights on all the corners. Remember that. I will. All right. Give me a big one. I got a nice place in Queens. Nice and quiet. Well, let's hope it stays that way. The pressure was on. With the continuing sponsorship of Magaddino and the help of Frank Mari, Gaspare DeGregorio began his campaign to take over the Bonnano empire. For several weeks, Bill Bonnano and the family captains remained in hiding, waiting for the command to move against Gaspare DeGregorio. Strangely, it did not come. October 22, 1964... Joseph Bonnano and his attorney, Walter Maloney were returning from dinner. Bill. It can't be! It can't! Let's face it. If they got him, he's dead. Shut up! He's not dead, Frank! Doesn't make sense. He tells us to disappear and he's out on the street with his lawyer where they can nail him? Come on, will ya? He's not dead, Frank! Tell everybody on the street to keep checking until we know what the hell happened. He's not dead, Frank. I know it. Hey, you hear they got Joe Bananas last night? Got nuthin'! It was fixed. Hey, what do you know? Look, the guy's a fox! The grand jury's on his back, Magaddino's got shooters in every alley. So Banana fixes to get snatched. Perfect. He's even got his own lawyer there for a witness. What could be better? He's had it. I'm telling you, he's in the bottom of the river with sea men's shoes. You seen Joe Bananas, eh? So tell him. Tell him! Get outta here! Atta boy, Elliot. Go get 'em. If you can't spend the holiday season with your loved one, a long distance telephone call is almost like being there. Make a lonely Christmas a Merry Christmas. Hey, how long we gonna wait, Bill? How many men we still got with us? I figure 100, 150 hanging in strong. Well, that's wonderful. Another month, we'll have four. Why don't you knock it off with those cigarettes? Lay off, will ya, Bill? They're gonna kill you. Oh, well, we all gotta die sooner or later. What are you reading now? Sartre. "Being and Nothingness"? I don't believe you. We're locked up in this rat trap for three months. I'm lucky if I get to go walk around the block once a week, and you're sitting here, reading Sartre to cheer yourself up. "Being and Nothingness." That's us. We exist, but we're nothing. Hey, Frank, out there astronauts are circling around the moon. And we're here, two guys fighting a war that started 200 years ago in Sicily. Vendettas that began with who stole who's chicken. I can't get it straight in my head, Frank. I'm not a part of what's out there, and I don't belong here. Like I'm suspended some place in time and space. What are we doing here, Frank? It's our father's wars. We're their sons. We've got no choice. It's a question of honor. Hello? Hi, it's me. Bill! How are ya? I'm OK. Any news about your father? Not yet. I just don't have any answers. What about Christmas? What do you want me to tell the kids? Tell them we'll have another Christmas when I get back. A double Christmas. Double presents. Double everything. OK? Bill, can't you just... Look, honey, it's... it's hard enough, huh. Don't make it any worse. I just called to say I love ya. I'll call ya in a couple of days, huh? Goodbye, honey. I'd like to send some Christmas flowers. Yes, sir. In what price range? I don't know. $30, $35. Something nice. And who does it go to? Mrs. Rosalie Bonnano. 428 East Meadow Road, East Meadow, Long Island. I'd like to buy that rocking horse in the window. Sir, that's $360. That's all right. Wrap it up. In the months that followed, violence led to more violence. Confusion ruled on the families. Defections took place on both sides. Loyalties which had existed for years changed over night. With the fate of Joseph Bonnano still unresolved, the balance of power continued in question. The families became vulnerable. Federal and local law enforcement agencies, making the most of this atmosphere of betrayal and fear, unleashed a campaign of arrest, surveillance, and subpoenas that cut deep into the foundations of secrecy and silence on which the organization had been built. Income from operations began to dry up. The situation had to be resolved if the families were to survive. Bill Bonnano was faced with his first command decision. Hey, Nick. What's on your mind? Can we go somewhere else? It's cold over here. Talk here. All right. Now look... Gaspare's a sick man. He's had three heart attacks since he took over. Tough. Tough is right. Nobody can move without getting a lousy subpoena. The cops tell the papers we did this to your people, you did this to ours, and then nobody knows who's doing what to who, right? So? So, uh, Gaspare says that we have a sit down and we work it out. Either we do that or everybody loses. You believe this guy, Johnny? Work it out or shoot it out. Come on, will ya? Now you call it. Anywhere, anytime. No tricks. Anything you want to set up. We'll let you know. OK. But soon, huh? This thing is getting everybody crazy. What do you think, Johnny? It stinks. Gas has been getting a lot of heat. Maybe he just can't take it. Joe? I don't know. As long as they let us set it up, what can we lose? Frank? Eh, let me talk to ya. Your father would never go for it. Look, Frank. Til he gets here to say yes or no, I make the decisions. We take the meeting. Well, it gotta be in our territory. We need some kind of edge. What about your Uncle's joint down on Troutman Street? That's good. I know that neighborhood like the back of my hand. Go set it up, Frank. Where's Vinny? He's up the street, up front. Where's Aldo? He's supposed to be by the corner. He's there. It's five degrees and I'm sweating. Yeah, take it easy, will ya? Watch behind ya. Bill, watch it! Cover me, cover me, cover me! Damn you, Gaspare! Damn you! Come on. Get outta here, Bill. The ambush on Troutman Street has baffled police, who found no victims and not a single blood stain. Rumor has it that the shooting was an attempt by the forces of Gaspare DeGregorio to eliminate Salvatore Bonnano, who since his father's disappearance has remained the unifying force in the Bonnano organization. The whole neighborhood is crawling with cops. They're asking a lot of questions. But nobody heard nothin', nobody saw nothin'. Stupid. Never should've taken the meeting. And Gaspare's got us shooting at each other. Just what the cops want. Well, Magaddino ain't gonna like the goof. Gaspare's in big trouble now. What the hell are we talking about here, huh? Who's in trouble with who? Who's mad at who, here? Look, Bill, we gotta make some moves fast. I mean, these guys are gonna be coming through our window if we don't nail 'em. Wait til we hear from my father. Still. Make up your mind. There isn't a chance he's alive. We don't move until we know for sure. How the hell are we gonna hold this family together if our people don't see us doing something? And we're losing soldiers every day. What am I going to tell them? Tell them to wait. For what! He's dead, Bill. Bury him! I don't wanna hear you say that anymore, Johnny. You understand? Your Honor? I am Joseph Bonnano. I understand the government would like to talk to me. You're Joseph Bonnano? Yes, Your Honor. Bill, it's for you. What's the matter, Bill? My father just walked into the federal court building. What? He's alive, Billy! He's alive! Hey, how do you like this guy? They got a room full of subpoenas waiting for him and he walks out on bail. His lawyer's gotta be a genius. So what happened? Next month they are gonna put you and I on the stand. And they are gonna ask us a lot of questions. So the less you know... hm? But you were gone 18 months... Let it go, Salvatore. Just let it go. Did they take you... Now fellows, the family. Now something more serious. I just wanna say... I just want to thank you for your patience and your loyalty. Frank. Morales. Perrone. Joe. Everybody. And, uh, to my son. The new consigliere. What's the matter, Joe? Go down the wrong pipe? Drink some wine, Joe. Open his collar. Take his tie off! Joe! I think he's dead. No! No, it's nothing! It's all right! It's all right, I'm telling you! Look! Look, I'll show you! I'll show you! I'll eat it myself! It's good. It's good! There's nothing wrong with it! No! It was his heart. That's right. It was his heart. It can't be the pasta! It was his heart. Hey, Rosalie, come here. Come on. You gotta see this. The hell with that! Come on. Put it down. Let's go. Come on. Put it down. Come on. You, too, mom. Come on. You were beautiful. She's getting older, but she's getting better. Hey, keep your hands to yourself. Come on. Hey, Bill, look how skinny you were. Hey, Mr. B, look at you dancing with Rosalie. A regular Fred Astaire. Look at Mari. He was seen on Troutman Street a couple days before we had the trouble. Where's Tory? Tory? Tory, honey, I told you never to open that door. Please don't open that. You stay away from it. People on the street think we're falling apart. We show them nothing's changed, business as usual. Tell all our collectors that we want to get paid on time, every time. They think Troutman Street hurt us? We lay it on double to show them how wrong they are. Cheer up, Johnny. We're gonna get it all back. How. How about let me go out and collect a few of those creeps that went over to Gaspare? Rosalie, would you bring me a glass of water, please? Sure, Mr. B. Hey, honey, we got company. Two more plates, huh? Two more! Is that all? Are you sure there isn't more, Bill? Just tell me what else... Knock it off! Lower your voice and knock it off. Hey, Bill, you better come in here, quick! OK, that's it. He's going to the hospital right now. Get his coat and car. You're coming with me if I have to drag you! Get the car. Get his coat. Come on. Hi. What'd they say at the hospital? He's gotta stay a couple of days for some tests. He looked terrible, honey. He'll be all right. You know Frank. He's made of iron. Yeah. You have to take those things? Make you all dopey in the morning. Maybe you can sleep through all that. I can't. I don't know how human beings live like this. Look, I promise you, Rosalie, they'll all be outta here in a couple days. You know, it's not just us anymore, Bill. It's the kids. The kids. They come home from school and they tell me everybody's teasing them. They say, here come the bananas. The bunch of bananas. Now what kind of a thing is that? They don't understand. They will. They won't be ashamed. They'll take it if they have to. Why? Why should they have to? Cause that's the way it is. That's some answer. That's some hell of an answer. Cause that's the way it is. What's the matter? I can't. I can't. Just a few minutes, now. Hey, as if I had more. Either come over here and kiss me or get out. Let me die in peace. Why don't you knock off all that talk about dying? I brought you a present. Book to cheer you up. It's called "Emptiness And Despair." I always meant to read that. It's the essays of Mark Twain. Thanks, Bill. Put it in here. What's this? Sam snuck them into me last week. Same old Frank. Well, I guess I'm out of it now, finally. What are you talkin' about? Out of what? You're not going anywhere without me. Who am I gonna yell at, huh? Magliocco, Notoro, now me. All gone. It's finished. What are you talking about, Frank? The family is old and dying, just like me. And it's just you and your father now. You alone. We got a lot of good guys. Johnny Morales. That's what I'm trying to tell ya. Morales left us. He's with them now. I don't believe you. It's true. You'll see. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I gotta leave you alone like this. But I can't help it, Bill. Look at you. You shoulda never been mixed up in this. I mean, you just got caught up. Remember one night we talked? Our father's wars? But there's no honor here. Take it easy, Frank. I mean, can ya... can ya take a walk with Rosie and the kids? Can you go to the beach? It's no good. It stinks. And it's gonna get worse. With me gone and Morale switching over to the other side, it's like a bunch of rest deserting. Frank, take it easy. It's... it's finished, kid. Get out. Get out while you can. Nurse! Yes, we have an emergency in room 421. He was the best. Well, It's good he went quick. Sometimes these things can last for a long time. Salvatore. Come. How do you feel about Morales? I checked it out, Pop. Why? Why would he go with them after all this time? Why? Hm? Maybe he just didn't feel he could be under boss as long as I'm still with you. How many people you think we still got? 100, maybe. Frank said it's finished for us, Pop. Falling apart. You... you believe that? No, Pop. We got a lot to do to save this family. I know. You don't have to do this. Who else you got now, Pop? To celebrate their new alliance, John Morales and Gaspare DeGregorio planned further attacks on the Bonnano family. I've got about 20 in Flushing. I got 15 more. Very good, Johnny. Very good. How many that leaves them? 60. 60 the most. All right. We're on our way now. Absolutely. Law enforcement officers are convinced that the return of Joseph Bonnano, who was allegedly kidnapped at gunpoint two years ago, will signal the beginning of open warfare to resolve once and for all who will take the reins of power within the Mafia. The entire underworld seems to be holding its breath, bracing itself for the bloodbath to come. Vincent Cossasey. Vincent Garofalo. Family affiliation, Bonnano. Uncle Pete, I'm gonna be an astronaut. Yeah? No kidding? Or a dentist. My uncle's a dentist, and he knows a lot. Yeah, but your father knows a lot, too. But he isn't a dentist. What's he do? He's a driver. Nah, come on. He does more than that. Yeah, he watches television and he drives. Aw, come on. Chucky. Yes, Papa? Come inside a second. I wanna talk. What kinda work you think I do? I don't know. What if your Scout Master said to you, what does your father do all day? What would you say? I wouldn't tell him anything. Why? Because I don't know what you do. OK, next witness. Call Tory. Has anybody ever asked you what I do for a living? No. Stop that. Stand up straight. Suppose your teacher asked you. What would you say? I don't know. Go send your sister in.

What was he wearing? I don't know. Pete found... found this in the back of his car. I don't remember it being there before. Maybe Gaspare's men left it. Was he wearing this? I don't remember. What are you talking about? You are his wife and you don't remember? No, I don't remember! How would I know what he was wearing? I never see him anymore, anyway. Well, is he dead? No. Where is he then? I don't know. Well, then, you think he's dead, don't you? Rosalie, please. Please. Calmare. Calmare? I ask you if my husband's alive and you tell me calmare? Rosalie! Calmare!

It's OK, Bill. Tell Mr. Magaddino not to worry. Everything will be taken care of by next week. See ya later. February 1969, 5:00 AM. Thomas Zumo. Family affiliation... DeGregorio. Hey, Bill. Take it easy. Take it easy? Gaspare's bringing muscle from four states and I get subpoenaed in Arizona for back taxes. Just what I need in the middle of this lousy mess. I gotta go back there and try to straighten it out. Well, it's a bad time to leave. Hank, they got me by the throat. They could clear me out with this piece of paper. I gotta go now. Let me have a couple of thousand to cover me down and back. Well, I haven't got it. What are you talking about? Look, Bill, four of my books have gone over to Gaspare. Last week we had hits on three numbers... big winners. We had to pay off quick to stay in business. It, uh, just cleaned me out. I can get it for ya in three or four days, but, uh... Hank, I don't have three or four days. I gotta go now. Well, how bout your father? I'm not gonna ask him! He's got his own problems. Payroll, rent on apartments, cars, bail, lawyers. War is expensive. OK, Bill. Here. Use this. That's Tirello's. That'll take care of your problem for a while. Sure this is all right? He owes me. All you gotta do is, uh, sign his name like it's written there. Look, Hank, I got enough problems. I told you, he owes me. It's covered, Bill. OK. Thanks, Hank. Good luck, Bill. Take care of yourself. I'll be at my father's place in Tucson. Right. No matter how many times I come back, I still get excited when I see it. It's the cowboy in you. You better believe it. This is home, baby. Five one nine five seven four nine. Yes. The bills on the card haven't been paid for the last three months. Mr. Tirello, the bills on this card haven't been paid for the last three months. Look, there... there must be some mistake. Mr. Tirello. Hello? Hello. Mr. Tirello, do you still live at 487 Riverside Drive? Yeah. And do you still have the two accounts at Manhattan Chase of New York? Yeah, that's right. I see. That's all. Thank you. Yes? The man is not who he says he is. Destroy the card, please. All right. What's the problem? The problem, sir, is that you are obviously not Mr. Tirello. I had a feeling about that card. What the hell's he gotten me into? Take it easy. Take it easy? I've been signing Tirello's name all across the country. Well, Perrone will take care of it. Sure. Bill, they just hit Hank. When?

Well, just be sure you feel like it a week from Thursday. Little matter of a credit card. Thank you, Papa. He's beautiful. Think everything out. Each one in the family... their life is in your hands. Remember that. It's our father's wars. We're their sons. It's a question of honor. We've got a lot to do to save this family. You shoulda never been mixed up in this. It's finished. Get out while you can. It's up to you to hold things together, you understand? I mean, can ya... can ya take a walk with Rosie and the kids? I don't know. What about Christmas? What do you want me to tell the kids? I don't know. Just wanna find out when you're going back to New York, Billy Boy. I don't know! Honey, when can you come home? I don't know! So what are they hitting us with? Conspiracy, perjury, and 50 counts of mail fraud. 50? What can I get? $65,000 in fines and 220 years. It was only $2,400. It's not the money, Bill. They're looking to put you away and they finally found something with this credit card. Not only that, Tirello's been arrested. The charges are vague. Might even be falsed. But if they squeeze him strongly enough, he can incriminate you and save himself by telling them that Perrone got that card illegally. They really want me bad, don't they? I'm not gonna kid you, Bill. It doesn't look good. I just lost everything I own in back taxes. I'm in the middle of a war. I could go to prison for 220 years. You say things don't look good. When do they ever look good, counselor? November 10, 1969. The government opened its case against Bill Bonnano. The war had taken its toll. The family had suffered heavy losses in casualties, deaths, and defections. In an effort to gain time and to regroup their forces, Joseph Bonnano had left New York for his house in Arizona. And Bill Bonnano, on his father's advice, had moved his family to San Jose, California. Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. Bonnano has already admitted to signing the name Don A Tirello believing the card was obtained for him legitimately. His use of the card is meaningless unless the government can prove fraudulent intent. The real issues here are was the card extorted and did Mr. Bonnano have anything to do with that extortion. Judge Mr. Tirello carefully. His credibility is going to mandate your verdict. Thank you. Mr. Phillips, call your first witness. Did you give Mr. Perrone permission to use your credit card? No. Well, tell us... when you met him, did you notice anything unusual? Yeah. Mr. Perrone was wearing a gun. Mr. Tirello, is it true that you were arrested on March 14 on a charge... Objection! Your Honor, I would like to show that this man's testimony is motivated by self-preservation because of criminal charges brought against him after Perrone's death. Your Honor, I object to these remarks of Mr. Kreiger. Don't make statements in the presence of the jury. If you wish to take it up further you may approach the bench. Thank you, Your Honor. Will the defendant please rise? Mr. Foreman, have you arrived at a verdict? Yes, we have Your Honor. How do you find the defendant? We find the defendant guilty. Before I pass sentence, let me state that there has been reference to the fact that Mr. Bonnano's father is reputed to be a former Mafia chief. However, I am passing sentence giving no consideration to this. As far as I'm concerned, guilt is personal. Mr. Bonnano, you stand convicted on 55 counts of three different crimes. Government ready? The government is ready for sentencing, Your Honor. Defendant ready? Bill Bonnano is ready, Your Honor. Mr. Bonnano, is there anything you have to say before I pass sentence? No, Your Honor. Salvatore B Bonnano, it is adjudged that you be committed to the custody of the Attorney General or his representative for a term of four years. Bail shall continue until such time as you are notified to begin serving your sentence. What do you think of the sentence, Bill? Is this the end of the Bonnano family? Is your father gonna stay in Tucson, Bill? Is he retiring? How'd you work the continuation of bail? Think you got a fair shake, Bill? No comment. All right, gentlemen, that's enough. Now let's break it up. What are you thinking about? That I only packed you two pair of underwear. What? It's true. There's two more pair on the line and I just... I forgot. I don't believe you. I'm going to jail and you're talking underwear. Just like my mother. She used to say, whenever you go out make sure you wear clean underwear. Otherwise, you're walking down the street, a garbage truck runs over your knees, you gotta go to the hospital, you're full of blood. They gotta take your clothes off and what do they see? Dirty. Oh, Bill. What's gonna happen to us? I love you so much. I like this time of the day best. The way the sun looks. The quiet. Don't worry, Salvatore. I will take care of Rosalie and the kids. They gonna be all right. Well, I guess I better get started, huh, Pop? I was looking through some old stuff, and I found this. My report card from Sicily. 99 in mathematics. Not bad, no? Will you... will you take a later plane? I gotta go, Pop. We better say goodbye here. Excuse me. My name is Salvatore Bonnano. Oh, yes. We've been expecting you. Salvatore Bonnano has just surrendered.
