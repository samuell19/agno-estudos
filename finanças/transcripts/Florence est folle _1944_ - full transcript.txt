"Poor mental development corresponds to a great extent to the volume of the skull and allows us to confirm the indication of hydrocephalus." Such studies show a relationship to that of morphological abnormality in skull bones and the soft parts of the face, with that of an alteration to the nervous system and the delicate functions of the psyche. There is much doubt to these conclusions arrived at by those studies of Lavater and Gall. Yet those works retain a singular influence to this day. Which means that the form of an individual's skull makes this individual a criminal or an honest man. Yes... tell me what kind of skull you have, and I will tell you who you are. The things one learns in a courtroom! It's a joke. Who can make us believe that the fate of an individual is dependent on whether he has a skull that is cylindrical, ovoid or spheroid? It's easy to be ironic, but we'll be generous and give in to the arguments of phrenology, rather than disregard the witnesses' statements. We only see a hypothesis which connects to the facts reported by these witnesses, being those reporting that a split personality was evident following dreamlike hallucinations. That means that the accused was a victim of split personality. No no no! Don't let yourselves be influenced by the exposition of the man of science whose intervention was requested by the defense. "Split personality"? This is a phenomenon restricted to the literature of fantasy. We are here for the cruel truth of the news item. And I ask you this question, gentlemen of the jury... If you surprised your wife in the act of adultery... and she says to you as an excuse: "It wasn't me who's cheating on you... "It's my other self". Would you accept "my other self' as a legitimate excuse? It's been claimed that the formation of the skull of the accused explains and justifies heinous crimes! If that were so, I would say to you... Since his head has a defect, a manufacturing defect... relieve him of it! Gentlemen of the jury, I want this homicidal head! You can give it to me at the end of my summing up. Like a ribbon that we put around blooming flowers still holds the bouquet while they've faded Like the simple silver ring that you gave me keeps in its closed circle our closest promises Also when comes, the oblivion of all things In the coffin padded white satin where I will sleep very pale on roses I want it to shine again on my ancient finger The dear silver ring that you gave me No, Jerome. My daughter doesn't look like an assassin. Everyone looks like an assassin. You saw the case that I made of Professor Wonder's theories. I won the argument. I was sure that your client would get away with 20 years. However, you'd asked for the maximum. To get something in-between. - Borel pleaded very well. - Thank you. I like to watch you battling each other. Friends exchanging insults is very entertaining. "Insults" is a bit strong. Let's say "sharp retorts". Today was our 50th trial. No, the 54th. - Are you sure? - I can prove it to you. Trust her. She keeps a record of my successes and failures. This album contains all my trials. The logbook of a man's conscience. Personally, I prefer the stamp collection. If we'd listened to all the experts... these fellows would no doubt turn their attention to some new crime. Here! Sisquet... He's been in prison for 10 years. Here is a client of yours. Champel. A sentimentalist. No. A strangler. Would you be so kind as to smoke further away. I hate the smell of tobacco. Jerome, take Borel into the smoking lounge. Actually, I must leave you... I've got a pile of work... 2 scams, 1 bankruptcy and 3 homicides. Business is good... You can't complain. Very happy. Goodbye, my dear, and thanks for the excellent dinner. I'd love to plead a poisoning case.... Just for a change. Unfortunately poisonings are down this year. Bye bye, dear lady. Once again, my compliments. - And goodbye to you. - I'll see you out. Until tomorrow. Your mother's smoke doesn't bother you, darling? He is charming... that Borel. He drinks too much. 10 o'clock already? It's time for bed. Excellent idea. It's been an exhausting day. Your summing up made me very tired. Too long. Too long. I'll try to do better in the future. Alexander, did you come down my trunks in the car? Yes Madam. Perfect. Something else: refrain from discussing aloud in the office. You were quarreling with Louise? Yes Madam. She lies as she breathes. I don't even take worth listening to. Good evening. You can dispose. Good evening madam. That's my theory. So good evening. Good night. Good evening. Sleep well. Thanks. You too. Good evening mother. Good evening. Good night. Good evening. Good evening darling. Good evening my friend. Good evening. Good evening. Hello? Oh, is that you? Honey, can I have an interview with you? Good. See you soon. Do you do your accounts? They are done. I'm leaving tomorrow morning at 7 a.m. and I'll be back Friday at 10 a.m. In the evening we have dinner at the Durys. Where we eat very badly. You have an appointment tomorrow at the notary, and with Alilaire. I know. We have lunch Monday in eight at the Galtiers, and on the 30th, a formal dinner at the Minards. Finally, your dentist waiting for you tomorrow at 11 a.m. Perfect. I think you'll be having good weather. Beautiful. 18 degrees in the shade, a light wind from Avignon. Perfect. What's the matter with you, my dear? It's not Thursday. Since you won't be here on Thursday, I thought that maybe tonight... You think too much. We'll discuss such things when I get back. Lucile... ...there are times when I wonder if you really love me. I adore you, but I don't like having my schedule disrupted. Well, goodnight then, Lucile. Goodnight, my dear. See you in the morning. Noted. Come in. Madam wants to see you, right away, Sir. Really? I'm coming. - Well, Louise, you're leaving us? - Yes, Ma'am.. - For what reason? - Because of Alexandre. What do you blame him for? I don't get along with him anymore. I want a divorce. Perfect. - And you, Alexandre? - Me too, Ma'am. - Perfect! - I'm sorry, but it's impossible. May I ask why, Ma'am? It's against my principles to let you disorganise my house. How can I do without Alexandre's amorality. - Very well, Madam. - Accepted, Alexandre? Yes, Madam. - No more chatting when you're working. - Very well, Ma'am. End of discussion! Hello Mum... I'm leaving in 3 minutes. Where's this mutt from? Mrs Goncort entrusted it to me. I don't want a dog here! Louise, put it in the servants' room. Here, Louise. Bye bye sweetie. Good morning, my dear. Good morning, darling. Everything ready, Firmin? Yes Madam. Perfect. I'm counting on you to respect the road rules. We don't overtake other cars. ...and we slow down in the bends. - Yes, Ma'am. - Perfect. Goodbye Mum. Goodbye, sweetheart. - Goodbye, my dear. - Goodbye, darling. So don't forget the dentist at 11.30... ...the lawyer at 2:30, and President Alilaire at 7.30 It's written down. Lucile... Don't forget... "the unexpected at 8.47." Can I use your phone? Sir? This is Firmin. A small accident. Madame passed out. No! No... just passed out. This time, I believe it's Professor Wonder. You waited 8 days before calling him! I thought I could do without his services. I love you. You're a good doctor... If I had a mild headache, I'd consult you. For the flu, you need someone serious. But you're never sick. Then I'm well-protected with you at my side. Come through... This is Professor Wonder. Mrs Chantelouve, my mother-in-law... my friend, Dr Dieutegard. My pleasure. My wife. Madam. So, she's been like this for 8 days? Eight days that she's slept... and that I haven't slept a wink. Well... Well, Doctor? She's sleeping. - Surely not! - No doubt about it. What we have here is a state of lethargy. Your conclusion? Only disorder-progression can enlighten us. "Disorder-progression"? Can't you wake her up? "Wake her up"? Wouldn't dream of it. An instant awakening is likely to produce unpleasant surprises. What kind of surprises? Who can tell, with psychic phenomena? Anything is possible. Predominance of the subconscious over the conscious. Bifurcation of imaginary personalities. Yes... split personalities But how long can this disorder last? 10 minutes. 10 or 25 years. I don't know. I can't spend 25 years waiting for my wife. - In my place, what would you do? - I'm a widower. Besides, I buried my wife in silence. I'd be very grateful to you to wake up mine. Alright... very well then... Only it will be totally at your risk and responsibility. Madam, would you kindly give us a moment. Talk with you soon, dearest. Sir, I entrust her to you. Yes... Just stay calm. Strange mentality. When MY wife was sleeping... Alright... My friend Jerome is not outgoing, but he adores his wife. Although... ...I shouldn't say this but she's a real stickler. She's very pretty. She's a pretty stickler. 45 minutes already! What can they be doing? - You alright? - Not at all. Why are you moving your lips? I recite stanzas of "Le Cid" to myself, to calm my nerves. What about you? I couldn't be more calm. You're fortunate... I do believe in the subconscious. You asked me to wake her up... It's done. - She's alright? - Physically OK... yes. - Just a moment, please. - Why? Because your wife is the victim of a curious complex. She's acquired a different personality. She says her name is Florence Bolero. - What?! - Yes, Florence Bolero... ...international music-hall star. You're not mistaken? No. And you must never tell her that she's suffering a complex. Such a revelation could be quite fatal. What exactly did she say? That she'd just realised how dedicated she was to her talent Curious case of repression, as well... That she'd been the victim of some sort of accident. - But that's all wrong! - I quite realise that. I'm going crazy... It's a nightmare! Wake me up! I could put you to sleep... ...until your wife regained her normal personality. Is it true that Lucile has gone mad? Not at all. She thinks she's someone else. You dramatise everything. Lucile isn't crazy. She disappeared. She's been replaced by a most seductive creature... ...whose name is Florence Bolero and who looks like her. But I didn't marry Florence... I married Lucile. It's an appalling situation. No, it's delightful. There are people who'd pay to have a new wife. You have a new wife... And economically. Do me the favour of economising on your jokes. My dear Professor, reassure me... Can I hope that this Florence will become Lucile again? Yes. It can happen from one minute to the next. It would be enough to come up with some psychological shock. - "Psychological shock."? - Yes. Involving strong emotion. If lightning struck her car, it will be perfect. There's also shipwreck... the ultimate disaster. An earthquake. I can't organise an earthquake! Start by entering her room. If she recognizes you... ...that means she's cured. What if she doesn't recognize me? Keep on doing it. Above all, don't upset her. Don't say anything... Let her speak first. Go on! Good luck! I'm feeling like a bigamist. Through you! What, me? It's not my fault. Who knows? These complexes may be hereditary. Zeraffa! You heard about my accident, darling? Well? Don't I get a kiss? Oh, I beg your pardon, I took for a friend of mine. Forgive me! I look so much like him? Not the slightest. You have the same tie. Coincidence, eh? No, it's not a coincidence. My name's Jerome. Jerome Benoit. I'm the tenant of this building. Your accident happened on my doorstep. You were brought in here. Are you in a lot of pain? Me? Not at all. I'm just a bit tired. I have a void in my head. You have a memory lapse. I?ve just come from Barcelona. I didn't introduce myself... Florence Bolero. - "Bolero"? - Bolero, like my dad. You must have heard about Dad. The aquarium man. I was born into show business. Mum was a nude at the Folies-Bergere. A little brunette with her nose in the air. Remember? I've only been a couple of times. How silly of me to ask you... You?d be old now if you'd seen her then. She got to be dressed. Your mother's no longer an entertainer? No, she was kidnapped. And your father, the aquarium man? He hasn't done it for a long time. Doesn't work with fish? It's a good business if you're young. What's wrong? With me? Nothing, why? I don't know. You seem upset. I'm not upset about anything. I'm sorry, I couldn't hold back. My little girl! I beg of you, dear madam... It's her! Of course it's her. Madam... Shush... not a word! Madame? Me? My daughter... But please, dear madam... Keep calm! Why does your mother call me her daughter? - "My mother"? - Of course your mother. Don't pay her any attention. She's rather tired. Poor lady. Do you live with her? Yes. - And with your wife? - Oh no. I'd have thought you were married. You have that look. I have that look? - No, I've been married. - You're divorced? - Yes. My wife left me. - Oh, I'm sorry. - What became of her? - She's probably nearby. She may return at any time. You never know. Listen, I don't want to shatter your hopes... ...but when a woman's ditched a guy, that's the end of it. I know myself... when it's broken, it's broken. There's no glue can fix it Could you leave me alone now? I'd like to make myself beautiful. Certainly. Unbelievable! Incredible but true... Lucile is crazy. Don't call her Lucile... Call her Florence! Florence is actually a pretty name. You seem to be quire happy with your daughters changeover. My daughter's my daughter, even if she's changed. She thinks you're my mother. How nice for you. Oh, of course! If the newspapers find out, I'll be ridiculed. I don't understand you... You had a narrow escape. I did? How would it have been for you, if instead of Florence... ...Lucile thought she was Cleopatra, or Napoleon's Josephine. How amusing! If I were you... ...I'd go back to Florence's room... I would leap on her without warning... ...and presto, the stolen kiss. And then? The suddenness of the attack will perhaps trigger the psychological shock. I have to act like a hooligan? No... like a man who's smitten. No different. With any luck, I could become my wife's lover. Goodbye, dear friend, and all my best wishes. And please phone me and tell me how it went. Whatever you do, don't contradict her. Good bye and good luck And stop looking so glum! Cheer up! Brief the servants on the secret of this tragedy... ...so they don't create any problems. Good thought. - Who is it? - It's me. - Am I interrupting? - Not at all. - Do you need anything? - No thanks. But goodness... you're wearing my pyjamas. That's all I found. Wait... Here is a dressing gown which would suit you. I tried it. I looked like a deputy- headmaster's wife in it. I'm sure your wife would never have wanted to wear it. I forgot my cigarettes. You wouldn't have one? - A cigarette? - Yes. Oh yes. I apologize, I only have Gauloises. Gauloises are the ones I prefer. Where are my trunks? "Your trunks"? Yes. I had six trunks. - Whereabouts? - In the car. Oh okay, sorry. What did these trunks contain? My wardrobe. They aren't there. You came without any luggage. - That's not possible! - Unfortunately, yes. My trunks! Where are my trunks?! Someone must have stolen my trunks! Please calm down. We'll see if we can find you a possible outfit. Here's a dress. No way I'm going to wear your mother's clothes. - Why not? - What about my image? Your image? What about this dressmaker? That'll make-do, in the meantime. "In the meantime"? But you've already been here for 8 days. "8 days"? Yes. And 8 nights when you slept in Lucile's bed. It's not possible. I thought it'd been a couple of hours. The time goes quickly with me. "8 days"? But then again, I did look a bit strange. Wait... So? Did that do it for the shock? Lucile? Lucile? Yoo-hoo! No, not quite... But almost. Once again... What?! You dare lay your hands on me? There... that feels better. You had a narrow escape... It was the vase or you. I'm not who you think I am. Oh yes. Why didn't you say anything, after the first kiss? Because I was tasting it. Well? Well, no. If you'd pleased me, I'd've proved it to you a long time ago. "A long time ago"? You're only just got up. Exactly, I'd still be in bed. I'm very quick. The more I look at you, the less luck you have. I could really do with a drink. - Would you like a milk tea? - I don't like baby formula. Don't you have any whisky or gin? No. What do you have in your cellar, then? There's rum, cognac, Cointreau, raspberry liqueur. I'll make you a cocktail... Cognac, Cointreau and raspberry liqueur. Where do you drink? Downstairs. You won't go down dressed like that? Why not? At the Folies-Bergere, I went down a staircase in just a G-string. My friends, I have a revelation to make to you. I'm no longer Madam's mother, but Sir's mother. Sir is no longer Madam's husband... ...since Madam has become Miss Florence. Are you following me? I'll explain... Very cosy bachelor pad you have here! This way.... Straight ahead. No, I said cognac, Cointreau and raspberry liqueur. Bring them here. So I'm not your type? What's so unpleasant about me? You're too sad... Too solemn. You look like what I hate most... a magistrate. Why do you say that? What's wrong? Do you like them? - Me? - Yes. Not really. For me it's magistrates, decanters of water, gas lighting. Pomposity and striped trousers sadden me. Would I charm you if I changed trousers? It's rather the whole outfit, that's silly. Te false collar, the tie. I like suits to be light, fanciful. Here...hit your tonsils with this. - Cheers! - Here's to your beauty. That's better! - How do you find it? - Explosive. I feel I've swallowed dynamite. It doesn't surprise me. You have a watery look. - A watery look? - Yes. That's what I've always said... He has a watery look. For 10 years I've been the husband of an ideal creature... ...who watched over me with love. Anyway, there she is. - She was your wife? - She IS my wife. Your wife has done a bunk. Doesn't this portrait remind you of anyone? Who do you think she'd remind me of? I don't know. She looks charming. She had class. She lived only for her home. Here's her unfinished tapestry. She did tapestry? Doesn't this tapestry remind you of anything? It reminds me of the little chain I made as a child. Oh, the seashell. That does reminds me of something. It reminds me of after the last Palmarium revue. I was serving mussels. I'm going to give dinner orders. There's no way I'm going to become your boarder! Well, if Fate has brought you here, it was meant to be. - Where would you go, otherwise? - To a hotel. A hotel? Forget about it! You're at home here. I'm used to you being here. To thank me for looking after you, please don't leave. What if your wife returns? She can't come back... you are here. If I don't forsake you, I'll stay faithful to her. If you don't forsake me... ...you'll have to change your lifestyle. Because your bourgeois fireside life does very little for me. Do you understand? I need to find some new shock. It's up to you to implement a new one. - You can count on me, Sir - I know. So on the way back, a few turns... ...two or three swerves and a lamppost or a pile of sand. Yes, Sir. We continue this festival with a nice piece by my friend Bizet. The duet of the 1st act of Carmen. The characters... Micaela, an 18 year-old Spanish girl... ...whom I'll closely resemble. Don Jose, exhausted gigolo... by Brancato. Come come, now, Micaela! We'll start the performance. - What are you doing with your hands? - My braids. Do I have to explain everything? Over to you, maestro. Have you reserved a table? Yes. The table for Benoit. My mother, I see her... Yes, I see my village again... Mrs Jose? Memories of the countryside... I see her... the woman wearing a feather-duster - Say hello to your sister. - How are you? Take your time. Charpini, you'll wait till we're seated, alright? Is this any time for you to be getting home? I'm going to tell Mum on you! Enough with the gags! That was a good start. My mother, I see her... Mr Benoit, here are your friends. No, I'm Mr Benoit. Excuse me but I'm the one who's Mr Benoit. - Right, Eugene? - Yes, Mr Benoit. It would be nice if some order could be brought to that table. It's just a misunderstanding. How silly booking the table in the name of Benoit. There are dozens of Benoits. But there's only one Florence Bolero! Get me the manager. Don't worry, Mrs Benoit. Not me...! Didn't you look at me? Do I look like someone who's called Mrs Benoit? Please, Florence...! Florence, please... behave like you would at home... ...when you're doing your crochet. Please excuse them... they're going to agree. As Eugene confirmed... I am Mr Benoit. So let me introduce myself... Pierre Benoit, champagne sales representative. How disagreeable! Mother, I see you... It's not worth bothering... The show's happening in the room. Madam, gentlemen, excuse me for this misunderstanding. - I'll find you a table. - I want this one. It gives me great pleasure madam, to offer you mine. So it's all arranged now? So we may continue, may we? Sweetie, I'm so glad to see you again! Florence! - All well, since Barcelona? - Barcelona? You don't remember when you sang at the Trocadero? What a triumph he had! Florence, come and sit down or I'll have to clear out of here. At that time, I was singing at the Palmarium. I had a terrific singing tour. Quite fantastic. My mother, I see her... I'm coming, I'm coming. May I, Florence...?. He's in great shape... Don't you agree? As being in shape goes, he's in great shape.. You too, as well. But where were we up to? You were at... My mother, I see her... I see her at my village Off you go. What am I doing here? You come and sing instead. That Florence is weird. He's going to turn me into yogurt. Oh, my dears! I'm feeling seasick. He has a view... He doesn't need his specs. He's graceful for a big guy. I've seen the mother at last! Who is this Florence Bolero woman? - You know her? - Like you, for 5 minutes. We've never been in Barcelona. Yes. But you should never upset a pretty woman. Did you know that woman? You want to hire her for next season? She's an amazing woman. - What's her name? - Florence Bolero. She's a great international singer. - She's been successful? - A triumph. He swallows everything you tell him. It's funny, because he could very well engage her. Make me a bouquet with all these... ...and give it to the lady with the feathered hat. Ladies and gentlemen, it's my pleasure to inform you of the presence... ...of one of the greatest stars of the music hall, Florence Bolero. Wonderful... with me wanting to go unnoticed. Florence Bolero, who I welcome on her return to Paris... ...after her triumphal tour in Spain. Are you sure that's Florence Bolero? Why? Do you know her? By name. But where will she sing? Well, I have a surprise for you. From the manager, Madam. Prosper Bianco, owner of this establishment. I'm delighted that you're honouring us with your presence this evening. Mr Benoit, Dr Dieutegard. Are you here for long, among us? That depends on the Parisians. Do you know where you'll be opening? Of course. But sit down, my dear Bianco. Would you like to open with me? - Here? - Why not? I'd have preferred somewhere on a grander scale. You could like open at the ABC or at the Casino... But be original. If you accepted starting with me... ...I'd promote you like an artist has never been promoted before. Posters, radio... I'll give you all my artillery. Publicity is my business. Just leave the ballyhoo to me. You can open here in exactly 2 months. Eugene...! Get me Bobby Joyce. Another bottle of champagne. Yes, but not that one. My special. That one's good enough for customers. When can I talk to your manager? He's in Barcelona. Get Jerome... He's a doctor of law. He knows all about contracts. And won't ask you for a percentage. Discuss my conditions with this gentleman. So when do we see each other? Tomorrow? - If you like. - Thank you. In two months, I'll have a terrific singing tour. Oh, I have every confidence. You wanted me? Yes. May I present Florence Bolero. She's opening here. I'll have to see you both. Bobby is amazing, He'll write you a beautiful song. He's the one who wrote "Flowers are kisses". Sort it out between yourselves. - You dance? - Pretty well... you? - So let's go. May I? - See you later. What if this personality change had happened as Lucile?! It would have been positive. You've changed, too. I haven't changed. I've evolved. Yes, that's right... But you've evolved, to your disadvantage. Remember how you used to be the funny one amongst us. Do you remember the morning, when, after a boozy wedding... ...we found you dressed as an archbishop and asleep at the foot of the Obelisk? That's wrong. I was dressed as Vercingetorix. You took 20 years to become respectable... ...and it took Lucile 8 days to be Florence. She is nicer. - Speak for yourself. - Yes, of course. When you take a wife, you have to think about the friends. You have two minutes to discuss a little business with me? Alright. - See you later. - Make it sooner. - Jerome's not here? - No. Bianco wanted him. We were waiting for you, to leave. It's 5 o'clock. So get my things from the cloakroom and join us at the bar. Bill please. Cognacs on me. I have an idea for launching Florence. We'd need a scandal. But a real humdinger of a scandal. "Scandal"? I don't understand. Who are you two plotting against? I explained to him that we need a scandal to get you launched. That's a great idea. But something explosive... a real time-bomb.. What is it you could do...? We could fake an accident in the Place du Palais Royal. You're crossing the square... and a taxi catches you... ...and it tears of your dress. You have nothing under it... ...and there you are, stark naked, in front of Musset's statue. I have photographers hidden. - You're out of your mind. - Why? Article 330 of the penal code, indecent assault... 2 years prison. Article 471-15 of the law of 28 April 1832... Scandalous behaviour on a public thoroughfare. - What if you had 2 lovers? - 2 lovers?! What do you mean, 2 lovers?! We can arrange for them to fight a duel. And next day in the papers... "Two gentlemen cross swords for Florence's beautiful eyes." Where do you get these insane ideas? But I think it's amusing. Barman, another cognac.... on me. If two gentlemen go out in the park to compete for your favors... you'll be charged under article 80 of the penal code... Incitement to murder... 10 years, with hard labour. We'll discuss it in the morning. The cognac's finished for tonight. You expose us to your incoherent drunken plans... ...and it's me who can't drink? - Calm down. - We're leaving. - Where's Dieutegard? - At the cloakroom. There he is. Good timing. Aren't you coming with us? No, I'm staying. I find this place delightful. - Goodbye, unforgettable Florence. - See you soon. Don't forget lunch at the house today. - And what will it be, Sir? - Two champagnes. Very good, Madam. Curious, this Mr Charpini. So go ahead with the shock, Firman. Pile of sand or lamp-post? Pile of sand, it's softer. Drop me off at the Ritz first, Place Vendome. ?At the Ritz?? What...? Are you going to the Ritz? Didn't I tell you? I've booked a suite at the Ritz. I didn't want to abuse your hospitality any longer. Why are you giving me that look? No reason. You could have warned me. It wouldn't have changed anything. And during my stay in Paris, I want to have a good time. So tomorrow, you see Bianco about the contract... Florence! What? We're not going to part like this. What are you talking about? I don't want to leave you. My dear sir, we can't start an adventure at this hour. Firmin! Are you crazy? I haven't come across a pile of sand, sir. We're there. - Were you afraid? - Me? Not at all. I love dangerous excitement. Anyway, your chauffeur drives very well. So see you later at the Ritz. Aren't you sleeping? No, I'm waiting up for you, would you believe. That's good... Saves me from having to wake you up to ask you... ...about the reasons why Lucile left. She was gone before I intervened. An just where have you been? At The Firmament. 'The Firmament"? Yes, it's a nightclub where you can have crazy fun. - Florence is engaged. - "Engaged"? As a singer. It starts in two months. That's great. No... It's inconceivable. Lucile is certainly a victim of heredity. Your dynasty contained a worm. You'd do better to be taking care of my daughter. -\What do you say to that? - Nothing. Among Lucile's papers... ...I found the manuscript of a novel. A novel? - Really? A novel? - Yes, my dear. A woman's soul is a labyrinth where reason wanders. Lucile wrote a novel in secret... "Florence Bolero, Star of the Music-Hall." "Florence Bolero"? So that means... Lucile isn't Florence. Lucile is George Sand. Please don't complicate things any further. What goes on, in this novel? So far, everything seems to fit. But the action stops... ...where Florence Bolero falls in love of a composer-pianist. Bobby Joyce. - Is he nice? - Not at all. So the novel isn't finished?. No... She's obviously a definite case of repression. It's absolutely essential that Florence becomes Lucile again... ...before this pianist has played his new piece. There's our beauty... Hello, sweetie You know Bobby Joyce? - Of course. Hello, Bobby. - Hello, Flo. He's worked well. He's written you a pretty song. "Night of Love." It's very pretty. It's a nice title. It'll be something people remember. It goes into the ear, and it comes out of the mouth. The Ritz is a great hotel. What a nice room you have! It's comfortable, it's artistic, and it has ambiance. Where there's ambiance, there is luck. That's their motto! Come in! - Tea? Port? Champagne? - Champagne. On my account. - Need anything, Miss? - No. I've put together plans for a publicity campaign. We'll go through it in sequence. Day after tomorrow, we're recording "Night of Love". Friday, you're interviewed on radio. I've booked a photographer to photograph you with Bobby. There's to be a thing between you and Bobby. The public loves indiscretions. Can you see the headline? "Florence Bolero inspired Bobby Joyce's prettiest song." "Night of Love." Do what you want with Bobby. I respect the private lives of my artists. Come and sing your pretty new song for me. This contraption's a piece of cake, and I know nothing about it. - So we start? - Let's go! Everything is asleep The sky is huge Come near me Let's listen quietly The voice of the past song of silence talks to us softly Of the same night a night of love Night of abandon, night of madness The day seems sad and lifeless when he comes to untie our arms Night of love Come down to me, please My only hope, my only friend Supreme oblivion of my weary heart till finally the memory of your secret haunts me The altar of your sighs lets me be reborn and sing Sing, of the night of love Come sweeten our destiny and in your sky until morning take us away Oh night of love I like it... It's a catchy song. For a song to be commercial, it must be catchy like cholera. An this is a cholera type song. Night of love...! I've no ear for music. Come in! - Hello. - Hello, Mr. Bianco. This is Albert, my assistant. So get your gear ready. We want to combine poses that are artistic, suggestive and spectacular. Should I stand by the piano? No. The piano will be the last step. Wait and see. Ah, there you go. Bobby, over here. Florence... You go sit on the divan. Here, in the corner, like this. So. Bobby! Next to Florence. Give him your hand. And we will do one of those flirty pics! It'll be fine from here. Bobby, a little more passionate. Get closer to Florence. Take the pose. No, it's not working. It lacks warmth. I don't know where I am. Miss Bolero's suite? - 78. I'm going there. - I'll follow you. What the...? You! What right do you have? The right of the strongest.. Jerome! What's going on? You're insane! Stop it! No... let them fight it out. You take photos. Lots of photos. Quickly! Two gentlemen fighting for the heart of Florence Bolero! I've got my scandal. Jerome's deadly serious... It's a windfall! Bravo! He's a piece of cake! Look. A true duel to the death, like in the Middle Ages. Get into the battlefield so we see you properly. Over to the other side, Florence. Hurry up, it's going to be amazing. No, not like that! I want anguish, feeling! Run towards them. And look upset... look horrified. There. What are you waiting for? Go ahead, Florence. Resume the pose. Too late. Get near them... Closer, Florence! Hurry it up! They're starting to tire. Wait. Go for it. Hello...? Police? We're not involving the police in this. Oh yes, on the contrary. Let's have a report... a trial. Perfect. I'll pay you for the camera. Of course, thank you. If you call the police for help, I'll throw you out the window. That changes everything. If you'll allow me... And now... you and me - But my dear man, you're delirious. - Not at all. - What's all this about? - Just a discussion. Why can't we take our publicity photos? We just wanted to get a portrait of the songwriter and his interpreter. Couldn't you have told me that sooner? Come in Come out. I apologize. I misunderstood the situation. You have a great right cross. I wouldn't have believed it! - I'd like to freshen up. - This way. I scared off the photographers. I'll get them back. I'll pay for it. Very well. But you could have told me that you two were together. No, not at all... Jerome means nothing to me. Tell that to others, but not to me. No. Florence is just a friend. It's a pretty spirited friendship. I tend to have an excessive temper. I don't have time anymore to discuss the contract. Come to The Firmament tonight. We can talk. - We're leaving. - You're leaving already? - You weren't bored? - On the contrary. - Thank you for the delicious welcome. - Don't mention it. He is charming. Don't you think he's charming? Charming. Charming. - A little champagne? - With pleasure. I'm very good-natured. Bobby Joyce could very well have been my lover. - No, Florence. - Why not? You're not the woman that you think you are. Basically, you're very sensible. It would be best for you to come back and live with me. I'd want to have an apartment that suited me perfectly. - Then you'll always live here. - Why? Because you can never make up your mind. Think again. I know what I want. I've often dreamed about an ideal apartment. It doesn't have the slightest resemblance to yours. So what's it like? I can describe it to you with my eyes closed... ...since it is a dream apartment. Show it to me. Do you see over there? That light above the town. - Which town? - The one you like. - A capital? - Of course.. A capital, on the banks of a river. It's in that town that you'll find my apartment. - It's not that large... - A passing fancy. That's it. What are you doing? Putting the key in the lock. Let's go in. - After you. - Excuse me. Here is the entry. A very clear entry... ...where the birds sing in a crystal aviary. Oh, there's my dog. He's a poodle. His name's Felix. Hello, Felix. What's got into you? I'm patting him and giving him a piece of sugar. If you make a fuss of him, he won't let you go. And here is the main room. ...don't you agree? It's a lounge, dining room, and studio. There's a high fireplace... ...and on the walls, canvases, full of melancholy and talent. That's nothing. Just a phonograph. I have 2,000 records, books, deep couches ...and armchairs in bright colours. What is it? Pretty roses. You'll find flowers everywhere.. Here, a table all set... two place settings, no more. I only like one other person at a time. Where are you going? Just taking a look at the bathroom. It's fitted out very well. How did you find such an apartment? - In my sleep. - Of course! Now, come and have a look at the terrace. There... Wonderful. Mist, stars, rooftops... ...and over there, way over there... The Seine. "The Seine"? Madam, a dream apartment can only be in Paris. It's always too windy on this terrace. Do you like it? - I'd like to live there. - Me too. With you. Phooey! You doubt me? It was about an ideal apartment, not a hell-hole. Hell or heaven, this is how it will end. Florence, you are not the woman you believe. Sooner or later, you'll belong to me. You're fixated on that idea. It's the only one I have, so I stick with it. You too... you take yourself for someone else. Who for? For a neat little gentleman, conformist, polite and well brought up. Well, that's not you at all. You're a crazy eccentric. - "Eccentric"? - Yes. You organise student lunches. For no good reason, you punch someone. You're starting to look like to the man you really are. You've made some advances in your wardrobe. When you've modified your hairstyle and moustache... ...you'll be quite presentable... Someone who could be seen with, even in private. Let me do it. But what are you getting at? I'm going to take off your mask and give you back your true face. You must have a charming face. I've been looking at myself in the mirror, for 2 months. I still can't get used to my new face. Let's not exaggerate. She didn't transform you. You're not a physiognomist. At the Palace, I caused a sensation. President Alilaire asked me who I was in love with. - What did you tell him? - Nothing specific. I couldn't admit to him that I was in love with my wife. It seems perfect to me. Perfect. When's the last fitting? - Friday morning. - Very well. Goodbye, gentlemen. So it's a fortnight till Florence's opening night? Florence hasn't started yet. What? I'm still hoping for a miracle to restore my legal wife to me. I prefer Florence to Lucile... ...but I prefer that you're more relaxed with Lucile. Also, I'm developing a shockopsychograph. - A what? - A shockopsychograph. It's an apparatus I invented... ...specially designed to cause shock... ...in subjects affected with hallucinatory amnesia. If you could extract Florence from Lucile... ...I'd be very happy. I don't live anymore. Everyday I go to the Ritz to watch over Florence... ...and limit her extravagances. She is shockingly familiar. She treats everyone like an old friend. - Really? - Oh yes. Every night, I go to the Firmament. My existence has become hell. And to think that two months ago, I was so happy. So now, it's Palace, Ritz, Firmament. Palais, Ritz, Firmament. Gentlemen, we invite you to listen to "Night of Love", which will be sung tomorrow, here in the Firmament... ...by the celebrated star, Florence Bolero. And here it is now "Night of love". We're booked out for your opening night. You'll be a smash hit. The ambiance will be great. It's on the house. It was great to have signed here. I couldn't have a better start. After such publicity, I'd have stage fright... ...for fear of disappointing. It's true that the audience here, is always on the verge of drunkenness. They're not completely aware of what they're hearing. What are you saying?! - Do you know this guy? - Oh yes. - Who is it? - A friend. If he comes to say hello, don't upset him. Why? Because he has a mania for wanting to know everyone. That makes relationships easier. So don't be surprised at his familiarity. Trust me... I know how to act. It's true, he smiled at me. Well, smile at him, too. What are you risking? Like this? But no, not like that. You look like you're provoking him. Like this. - Like this? Oh no. - No. That's it. He's getting up and coming over. Don't do anything silly. Be... friendly. Hell, my dear. Hello. - Hi. - Hello. With this stunning dress, this new hairstyle... ...I didn't recognise you. I only recognised Jerome. - May I...? - Please. Waiter... bring another glass. Your new hairstyle's stunning. No comparison. And he's looking good with his new moustache. I look better than last time? Fab! I told you so. I'm better off this way. Much better! You finally decided to be friendly with each other. It's about time! - That makes you happy? - Of course. I said to myself... "Can't they act like everyone else?" I'm delighted with this transformation. I'm delighted you're delighted, coz you look so happy. No... You want us to "tu"? I demand it... Us being old friends. It's a dream come true! Let's kiss on it! I'm not being too forward, am I? No more than a tiger! You don't look like you've been married for 10 years. Here's to your 10th anniversary. This is a delightful place, isn't it. And it's full of screwballs. I love screwballs. If anyone tells me you're a stuffed-shirt... ...I'll be able to set them right. It's quite obvious I never really knew you. You can say that again... We didn't know each other. To friendship. To friendship. Anyway... I saw Lagnier today. He's the one who did it. May I? He killed the debt collector. And the idiot confessed everything. We're in deep trouble. Are you involved in that? Yes. We'll discuss it another time. As you wish. Do you remember Sisquet? - Sisquet? - Yes. He died in prison. I would have thought he'd be tougher. - A champagne? - No thanks. While I think of it... it's very important... If you meet Berthier, not a word about Marcadet. Because I have Marcadet in the bag. What? What's the matter? You look far away. Marcadet. The train 704 hit... 10 passengers robbed. He'll certainly get away with it, because he has a good alibi. I saw him this morning, this Marcadet. He is a charming boy, very cheerful. I'll see. You have to see it, since it's between you and him that it'll be settled. You're an amazing guy. What? You could have told me earlier. - What's up with her? - It's just the champagne. You mustn't contradict her, otherwise it breaks everything. It's amazing how she's changed. It's been a while now, and she's still changing. - Hey, Bianco! - What's the matter? If you only knew what I just found out. - Jerome... What about Jerome? - Can I tell you a secret? - Sure. - Do you swear? - Yes. Well, Jerome... Jerome is a gangster. That's absolutely ridiculous. Not at all! And the guy who's with him... you saw him? - He's a terror. - Really? Have you heard of train 704? And of Sisquet, who died in prison? And of Lagnier? They're all in it together. Can you believe that I resisted such a man!? It's funny with women... the attraction of tough-guys. Are you quite sure about this? - Do you have business for them? - Maybe. Everything I told you stays between us, right? You have my word, I swear. - Is Inspector Guilbert here? - No. See you, old boy. Excuse me, the person I'm waiting for, just arrived. Compliments... she's lovely. Shall we dance? Let's try. Waiter! Go get me my cigars which are in my overcoat. - You know the guy with the woman? - No. He's not a regular Thanks. Do you have the things for table 7? It's just this one. At midday... Murder of debt-collector Put it back. Put me through to the police commissioner. Do it discretely... But watch out: they're tough. Take the little one... I'll take the other. We'll have them in two shakes. - No scandal. - Count on us. Don't want to answer? I've nothing to say. You were talking a lot with Mr Bianco. I took him for a friend. Exactly, I acted as a friend. Please don't speak to me again. Why won't you talk? The others came to the table right away. I don't eat at the same table. What is it? Can you come a minute? This Bianco of yours has got us into a nice mess. These two gangsters... ...are the prosecutor Jerome Benoit and Borel, the counselor to the assizes. The chief is hopping mad! He's in the process of apologising to them. No, Commissioner, it doesn't matter. This misunderstanding is instructive, since it demonstrates... ...that anyone can be mistaken for a gangster. Depends on the lighting. That's how miscarriages of justice are born. It's a precedent that will benefit my clients... That's enough... Don't tire yourself. It's case-dismissed. Going back to the Firmament? No, I've had enough laughs. I'm going home. I'm going back. My girl might have waited. That's it... Go reassure her. Commissioner, I have the honour. Excuse the over-zealousness of my men. I excuse it, although it is was unjustified. Goodbye. I'll do the same. Would you get me a taxi. They're always downstairs, Sir. - Mr Benoit, I'm very sorry. - That's alright. I suppose that Miss Florence Bolero is still here. Certainly. Have her join me downstairs in the taxi. No need to tell her who I am. Understood, Sir. Very well, Sir. Miss Florence Bolero, you are now free to go. Someone you know is waiting for you downstairs. Perfect. I'm not sorry to leave this fly-trap. You stay. I want a word with you. Driver... to the Ritz. No. Not this evening. Driver, 9, rue Leon-Pau Fargue. How come? You want to stay with me? If you want. Well, that's different. Driver, 17, rue Dignimont. "Rue Dignimont"? It's a surprise. I've spent many days waiting for this night. Where are you taking me? Here's your key. Open it yourself. - This is YOUR place. - MY place? Yes, your place. The apartment you dreamed of. The one you showed me around. Remember? I can hear your voice. "Here is the entry. A very clear entry..." "...where the birds sing in a crystal aviary..." "There's my dog. Hello, Felix." "Go to bed, Felix. Go on." "Here we are in the main room." "It's a lounge, dining-room, studio." "There is a high fireplace for the Christmas blazes." "I have 2000 records, books..." "welcoming armchairs, deep couches..." "paintings full of melancholy and talent." "here, a table all set... two place settings, no more." It's wonderful. A real dream. How did you find this apartment? Listening to you sleep. Up there, is your bedroom. No, not right away. That's the kitchen. And there, a terrace. I think the stars responded to my invitation. Let's see who's missing... The Great Bear? Here. Antares? Here. Polaris? Here. Orion? Here. All present? Dismissed! It's wonderful. Mist, rooftops... And way over there... The Seine. How did you manage to think of everything? I thought about you. You haven't forgotten anything. - Yes. -What? This. You see. I even planned the accompanying music. Madam is served. Her name is Violaine, like in the fairy tales. Felix! So you don't want to give it away? You don't want to give it to your mistress, Felix? Violaine, we wish you good night. We'll serve ourselves. Good night. You really are phenomenal. To the woman who's in you! I drink to the pleasure of living, in one gulp. You're cheating! You know, me, I... I drink very little. Cheers, Felix. No. - Shush. - No. Let me drink from my glass. To know my thoughts. It's nice to think that we think. I drink to remembering. Remembering what? You. I'll never forget you. You'll inevitably slip away... ...but I'll never forget you. Don't look at me like that. I'm not drunk. I'm happy. We're alone in the world. Love on a desert island. No one will ever find us. Nobody. No one. Florence, can I trust you? Tonight, I think I've proven it to you. Yes, that's true. So listen to me. Florence, I want you to know everything. Florence, I don't want to deceive you about anything. No... I know everything. No! Word of honour! Since when have you known everything? Some days ago I started to get thinking. - A niggling feeling? - Yes. And a feeling you you were trying to prevent a scandal. That night, I said to myself... He doesn't want to be noticed. Why? It's suspicious. Madam, put yourself in my place! And the next day, when you stopped Bianco calling the police... ...my suspicions were confirmed. And then? And then there was tonight. Now I've got the picture. And you still love me? But I never loved you... my love! Only since my moment of enlightenment. Thank you, that's a great weight off my mind. I love you, because you're like Al Capone. What? Except Al Capone didn't deceive those around him... He had the face of a gangster. You my love, are smart by being different. Differently organised. Your criminal lair is totally bourgeois. You'd be in God's graces without confession. And you visit the apartments... You rob train 704... you break safes... ..and you're interested in the guy who killed the debt collector. And you make a fool of the police commissioner. It's intoxicating. Jerome, I love you, because you're a MAN. Florence, you're completely drunk. I love you. It's the same thing. But wait... wait... What if I was NOT the one you think I am? Don't talk about bad luck... ...and kiss me, Al Capone. In this situation... what the hell! Goodbye, Lucile. Hello, Florence. 3 o'clock. Already? Florence! Florence! Did you hear? But it's nothing, my love. Let me sleep. What are you doing here? Mrs Chanteaux gave me your address. What is it? The shockopsychograph. - The what? - The shockopsychograph. I believe it's ready. Here... You conceal the device, you plug it in... you turn the knob and... No. - But you turn the knob. - No, no. "No"? - No use to me. I want to keep Florence. And Lucile? Where is she? You'll regretted it. I still didn't know if Florence loved me. What makes her so special? All those nights with Lucile for one with Florence. Lucile was bleak purgatory. Florence is delicious hell. So no more Lucile? Lucia is dead. Long live Florence. I'm happy for you, old man. By the way, your mother-in-law has found ...the end of the novel by Florence Bolero. Yeah? Does it finish well? - Aren't you superstitious? - No. Why? Florence, during the last chapter, murders her lover... ...because this one wasn't who she'd thought. Well... It's just fun. Lucile, novelist, we'll have seen it all. Everything! Hey, you taking your equipment? - Why say that? - Because you're leaving. I'm leaving? You're leaving, since I'm saying goodbye. Oh, very well! I understand. - Well then, goodbye. - Goodbye. Goodbye. - Regards to Florence. - Thank you. Don't be like the guy In the novel. Don't get yourself bumped off. Dieutegard... Tell me, by the way... how does she kill him? Revolver. Three bullets in the head. Bang bang bang. - Thank you. - Happy to oblige. Jerome? Who was that? No one. A man who had the wrong floor. What's that? Oh, you never know. Happy? Very happy. Me too. I'm happy. Yet last night I dreamt that you deceived me. Really? So? So I killed you, of course. Three bullets in the head. Bang bang bang! And I'd be quite capable. For you and me, it's life or death. I've made a serious decision. - When? - Last night. You seem to have had a very restless night. What've you decided? We're going to get married. Get married? But that's not possible. You're divorced, you're free. Free, free... You're hesitating? Don't you want to marry me? Yes, my darling. On the contrary. But there's my mother. I'll ask her for your hand. This very day. My mother's a woman of principles. She knows nothing of my existence. She thinks I'm a prosecuting attorney. Trust me. I love you enough not to marry you. Tell your mother I'll be seeing her. I'm going to get dressed. This is quite unreal... A girl who wants to ask the mother... ...the hand of her son, who she has as her lover. She's very insistent. You're not going to marry the woman whose husband you are. What is it? Miss Florence Bolero. Hello, Madam. Hello, my dear. Hello. - Sit down. - I prefer to stand. I'll be frank and direct. I didn't love Jerome. I became his mistress, and I adore him. I want to become his wife, and I ask you for his hand. Do you believe that marriage is essential to your happiness? Just be his mistress. It will be so much nicer. You're advising me to remain his mistress? Those are strange morals that you have! Good mistresses are always bad wives... ...and vice-versa. You find me unworthy of bearing your son's name. We can quite do without your approval! Jerome is an adult. It's up to him to decide. This is a cruel dilemma for me. No... it's yes or it's no. If it's no... I won't rat on you to the police. But you'll never hear from me again. Well then, that's quite enough. My patience has limits. I won't marry you and you'll stay with me. You big-shots don't scare me! Watch out, Florence, watch out! I don't take orders from you. You will obey me. You're just a coward. As for your mother... Don't insult my mother! Do I care?! Your mother's a... Lucile! He dares to call me Lucile! You boor! Mummy... - Mummy... - My child. Did you see that? He hit me. I want a divorce. The shock Lucile... Jerome didn't slap you, my pet... He just woke you up. Woke me up? I don't understand. It's simple though.... What's with this hairstyle? And that skimpy moustache? Where's that suit from? And that flash tie? You look like a dandy! I can't leave you on your own for five minutes! But you've been sleeping for two months. Mum, I'm not crazy! Listen to me, Florence... Lucile. What's this "Florence" about? A charming woman who looked like your sister. Florence Bolero. Does it remind you of anything? Florence Bolero... My novel? Have you been poking through my private things? I wouldn't have allowed... Listen to me, sweetie... Jerome, leave us alone. - But... - It's better. Now, will you please be reasonable and listen to me? I don't accept my husband rummaging through my desk. It was I who, during your illness... - "My illness"? - Your absence. It was me who discovered your manuscript. When two months ago, you left with the car... Firmin only narrowly avoided... ...an accident that could have been much more serious. Everything is asleep The sky is huge Come close to me Let's listen quietly The voice of the past... a song of silence Talks to us softly about that very night Cheers, Florence. First looks, first confessions Allure of mysterious sky That's just ridiculous. These words are completely stupid. Night of love "Night of love." How dumb. My God, that's dumb. My pretty dream of yesteryear The day dawns on the horizon Finally the memory of your secret enchants me "The memory of your secret enchants me.' Well, that's... That's wonderful. Ah, Florence! Why are you dead? Why did you leave me? Beautiful plans, now forgotten Comfort me Oh, night of love! Oh, night of love! First looks, first confessions Florence! Allure of the mysterious sky Florence, my love. Distant echo of a song Lucile... Call me Florence... since it's Florence that you love. Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
