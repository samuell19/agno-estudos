Hail, ho! Where away? Right off the port bow. It's a British Man of War. Helm, starboard, forward, take us back. Come now, Captain. You have Englishmen on board. Would you be so good as to muster your men? As Master of this ship, I will not stand for the impressment of American seamen. You have exactly three minutes before we blow you out of the water. Line up your men. Muster the crew. Your name? Edward Jones. You were born in Liverpool, weren't you? Aye, but I'm an American. I've lived in Boston for over 20-- Born British, forever British. That's His Majesty's law. We cannot, as a nation and free peoples, stand idly by while American sailors are dragged from their ships and impressed into British service, never to see their families or loved ones again. The ocean that washes these freedom loving shores was meant to be free. God created it that way. And the right to sail upon it should be limited only by the skilled and the daring and the men who venture upon its teeth. But what is the situation today? At this very hour, a British fleet lurks outside our harbor, impressing our seamen, commandeering our cargoes. Gentlemen, I must interrupt to bring you a message of extreme importance from the Congress of the United States. As of yesterday, June 18, 1812, between this country and the United Kingdom of Great Britain, a state of war exists. Mr. Parsons, I must ask you for the fastest ship out of Salem. Ask Captain Marshall to come to my office, please. Yes sir. Captain Marshall, Mr. Parsons would like to have a word with you. He says it's urgent. Hello, Caleb. Thank you for coming, Jim. Colonel Rogers, this is Captain Marshall. How do you do, sir? Good evening, sir. The Colonel rode all the way from New York. Rode? I flew. There was daylight between me and that saddle most of the way. Mr. Parsons tells me you're the master of a fast ship. Caleb should know. He built her. Jim, how soon could the Concord be made ready for the sea? 24 hours. Why? A group of French citizens have arranged to lend us 10 million in gold. Money is all that's needed to build a fleet to fight the British. President Madison has ordered us to send a ship to Le Havre to get it. Why don't the French deliver it to us? At the moment, France is not at war with England. This is a private loan, subscribed by French citizens. Their government dare defend the British by allowing a French ship to carry the gold. Can you do it? There's a British fleet sitting off Salem harbor right now. And the French coast will be blockaded by the time you get there. I'm not worried about getting in, Colonel. It's getting back with 10 million in gold bullion. That's a big risk. It's a risk that must be taken, Jim. It can mean the difference between winning and losing the war. Now what about it? We might be able to do it, with the help of one man. You better get the council in here before I mention his name. Jim! Jim Marshall, well, it can't be, man. I heard you'd been sunk with all hands. I cried, man. The room was awash with my tears. Oh, ladies, allow me to present Captain Jim Marshall, who can carry more sail, and in rougher weather, than any master afloat. Don't forget who taught me, Ben. That's right, Jim. Teacher and pupil, eh? If you had arrived a minute earlier there would have been a girl for you. Suppose you scatter these seagulls from your rigging. I'd like to talk to you seriously. You have to go, ladies. He's going to scold me. You know, I didn't tell you before, it's a dark family secret, but Captain Marshall is, uh, really my grandfather. Now, say goodbye to him. Good night. Who do they remind you of, Jim? Nobody I know of. Why? Look again. Can't you see the likeness? To whom? Why, to Leslie, who else? Clarice here has her eyes. Margot. See the fine nose and the brow? They're Leslie's. And Myrtle, the throat and shoulders. Identical. Good night, ladies. You still haven't forgotten her, Ben. I forgot her four years ago when she left me. I only keep her portrait to remind me how well I've forgotten her. What did you want to see me about? We're at war, Ben. So that's what all that noise and shouting was about. They commissioned my ship to run the British blockade. I can't do it without your help. I haven't had a deck under my feet for two years. Nobody wants to trust a ship to a man who's been cashiered from the Navy. Even if it was the British Navy. Master of my own ship again. I bet the town council squealed when my name came up, didn't it? What did you tell them, Jim? That I know the tactics of His Majesty's Navy as well as Nelson himself? That and more, Ben. You can be sure you did, Jim. Well, when do we sail? What's our destination? The Concord's loading now. We leave at daybreak for Le Havre. We're picking up something. To France? Is Leslie still there? Yes, she's in Paris. There might be a chance for you to see her, Ben. There's just one thing. You won't be going as ship's master. You'll have to sail as my first officer. I see. I'm sorry, I misunderstood. Under the circumstances, I must refuse. Ben, I'd have been proud to serve under you. But the council wouldn't hear of it. Remind the council for me that I was a captain at 22, the youngest commander of a ship in His Majesty's Navy. It's a little late for me to be taking first officer. Ben, this country gave you refuge when you needed it most. It needs your help now. You can't refuse. Very well Jim. I'll go on two conditions. You give me time to see Leslie when I get to France, and I want the right to pick my own gun crew. We'll not get through this without a fight, you know. Permission granted, Mr. Waldridge. Thank you, Captain. We sail with the tide tomorrow night. Get your crew and stow your gear aboard. The crew's below. All I have to do is sober them up. As for my gear-- First Officer Benjamin Waldridge reporting, sir. Hook, where are you? Sykes, Redlegs, Feversham. Hook, you're drunk. No sir, the grog's not yet been brewed that can unsober the old Hook. Line the men up. I want to talk to them. Aye, aye, sir. All right, you men, on your feet! Mr. Redlegs. You're drunk! I'm real disappointed in you. All right, fall in over there. All right, you lubbers, on your feet! Master, gunner and crew ready and able for duty, sir. It's a pleasure to see you can still enjoy yourselves, men. But now we have business to attend to. Business that will take you off the beach for awhile. Have them aboard the Concord at Derby Wharf within an hour, and sober enough to meet their new commander, Captain Marshall. You're not going with us, Captain? I'm sailing as first officer in charge of gun crew. Any further questions? You're second in command, Captain? You heard me. You're in charge, Hook. Gear the men up and get them aboard. Aye, aye, sir. All right, boys, to the ship. And them that's tardy will feel the weight of this. What's he up to? Huh? Second in command? That's not like Waldridge. And who is this goody two shoes, Captain Marshall? Now ain't you the suspicious one, Mr. Redlegs. Don't the Captain always take good care of his old shipmates? I tell you, it don't add up straight. I say trust the Captain. He makes more sense crazy drunk than most men does sane and sober. Something's fishy and I don't mean the finny kind. A blockade to run and no mention of destination or cargo. If the Captain has got something up, he'll let us know sooner or later. In the meantime, stow that talk and turn to. There it is. Move it down there, Hook. What do you make of this contraption, here? Why, ain't you never heard the Captain speak of his submersible? Oh, yes, I have, but I thought it was the grog that was talking. You mean this wooden tub can travel under the water? Like a runaway mackerel. Two men sits inside and works these here propellers with foot pedals. They breathe through them long pipes. It's against nature. Wild seahorses couldn't drag me inside that devil's coffin. Sail underneath the water indeed. Why, it's un-Christian. Captain Marshall, boarding's completed, sir. Fog couldn't be thicker if we'd oiled it. We must lose this tide. Shove off. No lights to be shone, no bells to be sound. We'll try and drift through them. Aye, sir. And Mr. Hackett, not a sound out of anyone. I'll log the first man jack that so much as whispers. No smell of British, yet. In this fog, they'll stand well off cape end. That's a British ship, no doubt of it. Lead helm, quarter point. Steady, son. Mr. Hackett, push all men to shrouds. Have them ready-make full sail when I give the word. Warn them to be silent. Every sound carries in this fog. Captain, there's a large ship approaching toward us just off the starboard bow. Helm, hard down. Helm, hard down. We'll have to run for it, Ben. I know that ship. We're hopelessly outgunned. What about that underwater craft of yours? Oh, they'd be on us before we had time to launch it. I've an idea of how to cripple it without a fight. She's directly abeam, about 100 yards. You'll hear her directly when you're in the water. Make straight for the rudder. You can swim faster than she's moving. You'll be sure to wait for me, Captain? Sound the bell once after the explosion. That'll do it. Good luck. Thank you. Ahoy! Answer that, Ben. British sloop Mermaid, Captain Cavanaugh with supplies from Canada. What ship is that? Don't sound it again. Ship close off the starboard beam, there. Away! We did it! --just spotted three British ships off the stern. They'll close formation and box us in. Full sail and hold her close. You have your orders Mr. Potter. Excuse me, sir. Captain Marshall is in command. We can't stay here, Jim. We got to wait for our man. Sound the bell once. But you'll be giving our position away. I gave my word, Ben. We've got to get away from here. One bell. You're jeopardizing the entire mission. Everything is ready to move, sir. There's Redlegs now. Throw him a line. Mr. Hackett, full sail. Course north, lay it close. Well done, Redlegs. Thank you, Captain. Thank you for waiting for me. Take him below, see to his cuts. Aye, sir. Jim. If I may so, that was a stupid risk to take. Under the circumstances, I felt it was necessary. But the entire mission was at stake. You jeopardized the ship and its crew for one man. I gave my word. He risked his life. But this is war, man. Even war doesn't relieve us of our responsibilities to our fellow man. But-- Let's leave it that way, shall we? Come on below. We'll chart a course. What's she making? 14 knots. She's a fast one. You men can turn in. Anybody talk to Waldridge, yet? No. Why? The whisper is we're bound for France. Well, that's logical. A secret mission in wartime? Sailing without cargo? Don't you want to know why? Not especially. I know how to find out. How? The Captain's cabin is directly below. Hang over the side and have a look. I'll give you a whistle if anyone comes. What about one of these little fishing villages? You're right. After getting through the British fleet at Le Havre, our biggest worry will be getting this gold bullion aboard. Can't hide 10 million gold in your pockets, you know. We'll worry about that when we come to it. What is it? What did you hear? 10 million in gold bullion. Gold bullion? Where? We're picking it up in France. I heard it with my own two ears. 10 millions. Wait till the boys hear this. Let's not be too hasty, Mr. Redlegs. We can tell the boys anytime. First, we ought to have a little chat with the Captain. If he wants to play square with us, well, good. But if he dupes us? Captain. What is this? If you two men want to see me, why don't you come to my cabin? Beg your pardon, Captain. It might look a bit suspicious, what with that Captain Marshall bobbing in and out. Hook and me knows our place. Don't we, Hook? That we does indeed, sir. Nothing like the Navy to teach a man his proper place. What are you two getting at? Hook and me has it figured like this, Captain. Should there be any trouble in the quarterdeck before this voyage is finished, we'd like you to know whose side we're on. And that goes for the others and the gun crew too. What makes you think there'll be trouble on the quarterdeck? Two captains is bad luck for any ship, see? And 10 millions in gold. Anything can happen when there's gold aboard ship, sir. How many of you know about this? Only me and Redlegs, sir. That's all. If you mention this to anyone, I'll have you out for conniving and mutiny, do you understand? You can trust us, sir. Never a whisper. Not even to my own mother. I'm quiet as the grave. Millions. Five million divided by two, three, four, six, seven, eight. Hey, stand away! Give him air. Can't you see the man's sailing uncharted waters. Give him air to breathe in there. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five-- What is it you need, matey? Can I help you? Hook, lift up my feet. I'll need my toes to mathematic this out. Here, use these. No hook. Good as five fingers any day. I never mathematiced in the millions before. All hands on deck, you lubbers! Mate says all hands aloft to take in sail. That's ordinary seaman's work. Let the ordinary seamen tend to it. I'll deliver your message to the mate. He'll have an answer for you too, with a cat. We'll go aloft. It's best not to attract any attention to ourselves. Besides, we wouldn't want anything to happen to the ship now, would we mateys? You sure you don't want some of the crew to go ashore with you, sir? Captain Waldridge and I will manage by ourselves. If we're not back by Friday, midnight, send as many crewmen as you can spare. Tell them to inquire at the mayor's house in Le Havre. Aye, sir. Just the two of them to fetch all that gold? I can't figure it. You think we can trust Waldridge? Captain needs us. Can't take the ship without us. Don't worry, Redlegs. I don't worry about Waldridge. It's that goody two shoes Captain Marshall. He may talk soft, but he's tough underneath. Wait until he runs up against us. The Hook will soften him. Aye. Any sign of them yet? Not a speck. 84 hours. They should've been back by now. Muster a longboat crew. We'll have to go to Le Harvre. That was Captain's orders. Take a couple of Waldridge's gunners. They'll come in handy if there's trouble. Any of Waldridge's gun crew here? Mr. Potter, the high and mighty gun crew of Captain Waldridge, they won't even associate with us common seamen. Won't even eat with us. Oh, they're a dainty lot. Well, where are they? Soon as they were relieved of duty, they jumped below to gamble. Gamble? What with? I've seen them bet a thousand gold on the turn of a card. They take it serious too. Redlegs keeps an account of who's winning and who's losing. They must be getting into the grog. Andrews, go below. Fetch Hook and some of his men to man the longboat. You wishes to see me, Mr. Feversham? First I'll double my wager. 5,000 gold sovereigns. Mark it down, 5,000 gold sovereigns. And now Mr. Feversham, I'll double you. 10,000. What have I got due me in the book? Your original share was 100,000. You're now down to, uh, 50,000. 10,000 more. -You can't do it. -Why can't I? It's my gold. It was agreed that no man could gamble away more than half his share. Otherwise, you might lose interest in taking part in the small mutiny. I don't want to hear that ugly word spoke again. What makes you so sure we'll get the gold? Was you looking for something, Mr. Andrews? Was you eavesdropping, Mr. Andrews? That's not nice. I didn't hear a thing. The Hook here says you heard every word. You can't let him go. Let's cut him in. Would you like to come in with us, Mr. Andrews? Sure, sure. I'll go along with you. But Hook, the shares are so even. I'll have to mathematic them all over again. I won't talk. You can trust me. I won't say a word. What brought you down below? I was just thirsty, that's all. Drink! Drink! And now, Mr. Feversham, before we was so rudely interrupted, you was wagering what? It's your game, Hook. Yeah. He'll be washed overboard tonight. All hands on deck! Let's go. It's them. They're being overtaken. Hook, clear away a gun. They're gaining on us. Why don't they cover it? Get down there! Up! All right, hurry it up. Depress a point, hurry! Up! It must be in the chests. Aye, the chests. Rig a hoist, get that boat aboard. Stow the anchor and the cable marker. Aye, sir. That was a close squeeze, ma'am. Are you all right? Get her below, Ben. My trunk, it'll be all right? The men will bring it aboard. and make full sail. Set a course south by west. Stay close to the shore line. Our friends may be back. Aye, sir. Oh, my darling. I can't believe it. Leslie, Leslie. How often I've spoken that name and you weren't there to answer. You know what I thought when those English agents were firing on us? I thought we were going to die, but at least we'll die together. Don't ever leave me again, Leslie. Never again. I'm so proud of you. This is such a beautiful ship. We'll be able to start all over again. Make a new life for ourselves in America. We're getting underway. I better go up on deck. I've got to change my dress. When next you see me, I shall be so beautiful you won't recognize me. Excuse me. I'll need you on deck to help with the navigation. I'll be right up. If we stay close in, they may not spot us. It'll be a miracle if they don't. The coast is alive with British agents. I want to thank you, ma'am. We'd never reach the people we had to without your help. I regret having to bring you aboard. As soon as it's safe we'll lower a longboat and have you return. I expect Captain Waldridge hasn't had time to tell you, Mr. Marshall, but I'm not going ashore. I'm making the trip with you. That's impossible, ma'am. As soon as it's safe we'll have-- Jim. With the British squadron breathing down our necks, I think our first concern-- Just a minute. Since when does Captain Waldridge take orders from his first officer? I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm in command of this ship, not Captain Waldridge. On this voyage, I volunteered as first officer. Why didn't you tell me in Le Havre? Jim, if you put Leslie ashore, you'll have to put me ashore with her. I'll hold you by force, if necessary. It will be necessary. You'll please get ready, ma'am. So the mighty Captain Waldridge is now taking orders from a school boy. Leslie, it was the only way I could get to see you. And what of the great new life we were going to have? On what? A first officer's pay? Go ahead. Have a drink, Captain Waldridge. Have two. Drown your sorrows like a common seaman, but it won't wash down the lies you told me. I did it because I love you. Was it love back there in Le Havre when you talked like King Midas? Millions, you had. Have another drink. Maybe it'll refresh your memory. Please, Leslie, you've said enough. Have I? For you, perhaps. Not for me. I'm getting off this boat and out of your life forever. Go ahead. This time, I won't try and stop you. Go away! Brought your trunks down for you, ma'am. Well, you can take them right back up again. I'm leaving. Didn't you hear me? I said take them back on deck. Aren't you going to open them, ma'am? You can trust us, ma'am. Close as that to Captain Waldridge we are. Get out of here before I have you both flogged. I wouldn't call if I was you, ma'am. A pretty throat. I'd hate to have it catch on the hook accidental like. Let's open them up, Redlegs. We'll see for ourselves. You're insane, both of you. We're bilked. I knew it. A thousand years of the blackest luck. You must have brought it on board with you. Where is it? You wouldn't have sailed without it. I don't know what you're talking about. Where is what? The gold. 10 millions of it. The gold we made this blasted trip for. So that's what he was talking about. Then you do know about it. Of course. I thought it was only talk. If it's not in the trunks, where is it? Well, it must be on board. They got whatever they went ashore for. I heard them say so. Did you lose an anchor on the way across? What did you do with the one you brought aboard? Stowed in the forward locker. Can we see it? We can try, but it isn't a place for a lady to go. If that anchor's what I think it is, I can forget I'm a lady. Gold! 10 million in gold. You're dirty, you smell of tar and haven't shaved in weeks, but I think I love you both. Being a true seafaring man, anchors has always been my weakness. Change course. West by south, quarter south. West by south, quarter south, sir. I'm sorry about Leslie, Ben. Everything happens for the best in this best of all possible worlds. Maybe she can join you later. Leslie will do what's best for Leslie. She's preparing to return to Paris now. Lights off the starboard bow, low down on the horizon! There goes another beacon. They've got us spotted, all right. They're signaling the British squadron. We better head south, where there's plenty of room to run for it. Go below, Ben, and chart us a course. Keep us a close as you can to the shoreline. Maybe we can lose them by daybreak. Yes? Ben? Ben, I've looked all over the place for you. The first officer of the ship's a busy man. I'm sorry, Ben, I've hurt you. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to, it was just the disappointment. We had such wonderful plans together for America. Won't you forgive me, Ben? Please. That's unimportant. I was wrong. I have no right to ask you to love a failure. I'll not hear you say that. You're not a failure. You're my captain. Oh, we've had such wonderful dreams and plans for the future. I want to help you make those dreams come true. It's too late. Marshall's going to put you ashore at the first safe moment. Darling, you underestimate women. Captain Marshall is at a disadvantage. Now, if you were captain of this ship, and I asked you very prettily not to put me ashore, could you refuse me? Your prisoner has escaped, Captain. Not my prisoner, only my guest, ma'am. Oh, is it American politeness to order their guests from the house? Sit them down where their enemies can destroy them? The responsibility of this ship, its crew, and a very important mission are in my hands. I have to guard against all hazards. Am I such a hazard? The ship in wartime is hardly the place for a woman. A woman's place in war or out is beside the man she loves. Have you ever loved anyone, Captain? So much so that every day, every hour spent apart from that person isn't living at all? I'm very happy for Ben's sake that you've learned to care for him so deeply. He went to pieces pretty badly when you left him four years ago. Because I was wrong four years ago that I want to be right this time. He needs me desperately. You're his friend. It's in your power to help him. He's started to drink already. I'll arrange for you to join him in America when the war is over. Beyond that, there's nothing I can do. Sail ho! Where away? Bearing five at the starboard quarter, sir. She's a big one. She's coming fast. Looks like 74 gun. Left, quarter point, steady so. Left, quarter point. She's The Aurora, fastest ship in the general fleet. It couldn't be worse. -Can we outrun it? -In this wind? Not a chance. Clear the deck for action. General quarters there. Aye, sir. Come on, take a look at the chart. We can't reach open sea. We've got 10 hours of daylight ahead of us. They got our rigging. Look here, Jim. Look at this reef. Tousaw Shoals, it's called. It's about four miles south of us. We're here. 12 years ago, the ship I commanded struck bottom here in open water. Part of an uncharted reef. I checked every admiralty chart. They showed 12 fathoms, but I hit bottom at three. I suggest that we head for the shoals and turn suddenly as if striking out to sea. The Aurora will cut across to intercept us. Our only hope is if we get through and she sticks on the reef. Will The Aurora draw enough water to strike bottom? Well, a ship of her class draws about 18 feet, probably more. We're drawing less than 12. We've got to risk it. I'll have a leadsman take us down there-- If we get that bow down out of action, she'll never make the shoals. Mr. Potter! Make this one count, Hook, with all. Good work, Hook! Five the mark! --full of water, Captain. I know. We'll be beached. Hold your course. By the deep, four! We have about five minutes, then she'll be close enough to hit us with the broadside. And a half four! By the deep, three! The Aurora can't get through here. Can we? It struck! She's over. She's almost on us. In another minute she'll be within broadside range. Mr. Hackett, bring her about. Helm, hard down! Helm, hard down! Braces intact. Lighten the ship! Over the side with the guns. They're no good to us now. Over with it. Every pound counts. Loosen the gun shackles. Let her go in the next row, her own weight will carry her over. Goodbye. Stand clear! Haul away! We're over the reef, hold her so! Hold her so! If she stays on course, she'll be on the reef before she can fire again. May I propose a toast to our very beautiful and charming guest, who once and for all dispels the ancient lie that a woman aboard ship brings bad luck. Hear, hear. I accept your gallant tribute, Captain, in the name of all women. I the success of our venture. Now it's my turn. But instead of a toast, it becomes my unpleasant duty to reprimand Captain Marshall. Today he did a very foolish thing. At the risk of losing his ship and his own life, he saved mine. Captain Marshall, the action you took today to save one crew member was unwarranted. However, all I can say is thank you, Jim. The reprimand is acknowledged. The thanks are out of order, Ben. You'd have done the same for me. Would I? I wonder. Ben, there may be some doubt in your mind, but believe me, there's none in mine. Starboard watch on deck. I'm afraid that's me. I'll you'll excuse me. I'll leave you two to carry on. You've grown very fond of Captain Marshall, haven't you, Ben? Why not? He reminds me of my youth. Once I too had plans for the future. The admiralty used to say I'd command a fleet one day. That was yesterday. I'm thinking of tomorrow and lots of tomorrows for you and me. Here's to tomorrow. You must not let friendship interfere with you plans. You mentioned plans once before. Just what plans are you referring to? Oh, don't be allusive, my darling. All those golden promises you made to me in Paris. I'm going to hold you to them. Don't you think it was a little bit strange that I didn't go ashore? I found out about the anchor. Who told you? Your Mr. Hook isn't as secretive as you are. I'll stretch his neck for this. Don't be hasty. We may need his help. Leslie, I admit I did consider such a plan, but I'm not going through with it. I bet you change your mind. Have you grown soft? I've grown tired of living under a cloud, being known at every port as the captain who stole a ship's payroll to pay a woman's debts. This voyage will give me a new chance. The United States trusts me. Once back in Salem, I'll have recognition. We can start a new life there. Are you blind? Recognition of whom? Captain Marshall's in command of this ship. He's the hero of this mission. You're only the first officer. He'll get everything, you'll get nothing. There's honor enough for everyone. Jim will share with me, I know he will. Haven't you enough sense to know when you're being used? Could he have succeeded without you? Who saved the ship for him back there when the British had him trapped? And who saved my life? Was it worth saving, Ben? You said yourself you couldn't live without me. Well, I can't live without the things that make a woman's life worth living. Take your choice, Ben. 10 million in gold and me or nothing? It's madness. The only mad thing would be to give up without trying. You had a plan once, you must go through with it. That's in the fire now, Ben. The Hook has told the others. They're awaiting your command. It's too late to stop them now. If we should fail, hanging isn't a pretty death, my Leslie. We've waited too long for such a chance. To talk of failure now. I'll go find Hook. We'll be at the Azores tomorrow night. I say we take the ship right there. We still have miles of the ocean to cross. Should we meet a British ship or run into a gale, we would be short handed. I don't like this stalling, Captain. I don't like this interference. Either we do it my way or not at all. What's your plan, Captain? We'll proceed this way. Marshall will sail from the Azores following this route. At this point he'll change course and pick up the Northeast trades to Salem. There's only one logical place to take over the ship. This is it. That makes good sense to me. How are you disposing of the anchor? We'll melt it down and use brokers in Havana. What happens to Captain Marshall? You leave Marshall to me. Anything else? Come on, Hook. We stood with Captain Waldridge before. I stand with him now. You better do the same. Agreed. Get back to your watch. We're about 150 miles from the Bahamas. We've got to change course, proceed north. We'll hold our present course until midnight, then change. We've got a stark wind with us that's not losing. Five days and we'll be off Salem harbor. It'll be good to be back, Ben. Yeah. You know, something has been bothering me. What's that? Well, you've done your share, Ben. It should have been a joint command. When we ride into Salem harbor that's the way I want it to be. I can't accept. I insist, Ben. Excuse me, Captain. Pivot's jammed on one of the deck guns. You'd better have a look at it. I won't have it any other way, Ben. See how you feel about it tomorrow. Where's she jammed? Nothing's jammed, sir. Everything's shipshape, Captain. We're in the Bahamas. When do we change our course? Eight bells. It'll be dark tonight. What's the signal? I'll give it to you. Give it to us now, Captain. At eight bells, I'll take the watch. That's the signal. Good enough. Ben? Leave me be, Leslie. We're going on in a few minutes. I know. Then what are you worrying about? The men are well armed. It'll go like clockwork. I know. You won't be sorry, Ben. With this ship we can sail to the far east, to Singapore. With the gold we can buy ourselves a new future. One night's work and it's all ours, Ben. Hurry, Ben. Let's go. On deck, Captain! Quick, there's a mutiny! Hold a course, half east. Half east. Captain Waldridge, your men are on mutiny! Ben, call off your men or I'll shoot. Sykes, hold her so. Ben, what have you done? Take him below. This is better than grog, huh? Aye, we must have a stock in this. Sykes, you look like a real gentleman. Come in, Leslie. Meet your new ship's officers. Get them out of here, Ben. Please! You heard the lady. Back to the , both of you, go on! You too. Me? I'm second mate now. You are, are you? First Officer Hook, your humble servant, your ladyship. I don't think your men impressed the lady, Hook. They're good boys, Captain. Just a little excited, that's all. I'll keep them under control. Chuck the grog overboard. I want every man sober. Collect all the firearms and lock them back in the armory. Rig a flogging post. The first man to break an order gets 20 lashes. Hop to it. Aye, sir. What have you done with Marshall? He's in irons. And the crew? They're in irons too, down in the hole. What are you going to do with them later? When we get to Havana, I'll release them. And Marshall? He'll get the same treatment as the others. He's not the same as the others. They've only lost their freedom for a little while. He's lost his ship. He'll never forget. Are you suggesting I kill him? Let him live, he'll kill you. He'll have to find us first. We'll be on the other side of the world. He'll never give up until he does find you. You know that as well as I do. I'll take my chances. Hook and the others, they're not squeamish. If you don't kill him, they will. Just checking to see if Captain Marshall was comfortable, sir. Go ahead, Ben. Get it over with. What are you waiting for? I want no witnesses. Get out that port. Here's a compass. We're 50 miles from shore, west, northwest. There's a plank, there's a paddle. You've one chance in a thousand. Take it. From now on we're even. You just hanged yourself, Ben. I beg your pardon for ever having doubted you, Captain. Hey, Pete! Hey, Joe, go get Pa. Where am I? You be near Buford, Georgia. How long? Oh, almost a week now. I've been unconscious all that time? You'd rouse and rave a little, then fall sleep. We notified the Navy like you said. Now, now there. You've got to rest. You're in no condition to move. Hey Pa, they're coming! Are you Captain James Marshall? Yes. Of the American ship Concord? Yes, sir, I have orders to bring you before a board of inquiry in the shortest time possible. Captain, while we argue, Waldridge is slipping away with the gold. I've got my orders, Captain Marshall. Are you suggesting that I disobey them? I'm suggesting you save 10 million in gold. There's only one place Waldridge can dispose of it. Brokers in Havana. He's probably there already. He'd have to stop at some island in order to melt the anchor down. But he's got a week on us. Half that time would be spent melting the gold down. Besides, his crew is short handed. If we set about now we can intercept it. What do you think, Mr. Stone? Washington's been burned by the British. We need that gold desperately. What have we got to lose, sir? I beg of you, set about now. It may mean the winning of the war. Set a new course. South by a quarter west. Aye, sir. That'll bring her up at Havana. Thank you. Ahoy! Have you spotted a. five days ago, heading southwest. Five days? That's a tremendous head start. Alert the crew. Proceed at full sail. If this wind holds we'll holds, we'll still have a chance. It'll have to. Waldridge won't dare sail into Havana openly. No broker will touch that gold before it's melted down into ingots. He'll put into an island some place. Caribbean's full of little islands. Like looking for a needle in a haystack. Most of them are inhabited. He'll put into one that isn't. That's where we'll have to look. Land off the starboard beam! Any sign of her? She was sighted three days ago off Lamba Island. Direct on course to Havana. Havana's a two day voyage. We can never overtake her. Well, there's still a chance. The British Man of War Britannica is guarding the harbor to Havana. She's an 80 gunner. Waldridge could never get past her. There are dozens of small bays all along the Cuban coast that she could slip into. What do you think Waldridge will do? Lamba. Lamba's uninhabited. It'd be good anchorage, an ideal place for him to melt the anchor down unobserved. Well, it's as good as guess as any. Mr. Stone, set course for Lamba. Aye, sir. When did you see this big ship off Lamba Island? Only yesterday. I got her name too. What was it? The "Sea Spray." First thing Waldridge would do would be to change her name. Did you board her? They wouldn't let me board her. I tried to sell them some fish, but all they wanted was grog. Was there an Englishman among them? No. But when they found out I had no grog, they cursed like a pack of pirates. Especially a big fellow with a hook on his arm. Oh, he had a mean tongue. That's The Concord, all right. There will be a full moon tonight. It's going to be difficult to take them by surprise. May not be as difficult as we think. How much grog have you got aboard? That's the last of them. See that it's all stored below proper. Gold's all aboard, Captain. We'll be shipshape in about an hour. Why didn't you put that fire out? Well, it got too big. It'll burn itself out. The Britannica's in these waters. I want no chances taken. She may spot us. Put the fire out. We'll be out of here by 8 bells, Captain. Not in this calm. We won't have a breeze until morning tide. What's another night with 10 million in the hold? I want a strong hand kept on the men. Don't let up on the discipline. Post a double watch on deck and on the prisoners. About those prisoners, Captain. How long are we going to carry them? We'll drop them outside of Havana harbor. Could drop them here. That's an order. Aye, sir. Where'd you get the cheroot, Hook? Compliments of the Captain. Yes, when he wasn't looking. You insinuating I'm a thief? Why, no, Hook. Everyone knows you've got a fine character. We're all fine characters. Yeah. You wait until we split up our shares. I'll show you how a gentleman lives. Hook! That fisherman is hauled to again. Tell him to go sink himself. Said he's got grog. Grog? Keep a weather eye out for the Captain. Mhm. What are you selling this time? You said you wanted grog. It's real. Come on up. Oh, no. I want my money first. And none of those lead bullions either. Will you take gold? Aha, gold's my pleasure. Fetch him an ingot. A small one. It's against Captain's orders, Hook. Oh, who's going to miss one small ingot? Get going. Ben. What's happened to the men? I had the grog thrown overboard the night we took the ship. Must have hidden some. Down. I'll go no more a roving with you fair maid. A roving, a roving, since roving's been my ruin-- Look out! Drop your arms! All right, you scum. Get in line. That's all of them? All that's still alive, sir. Where's Waldridge? He went below. Come on. Marshall, he caught up with us. Marshall? You mean he isn't dead? Oh, you fool, you idiot! I don't have time to talk about that now. We still have a chance, come on. Call off your men! Call off your men or I'll blow this ship all over the ocean. Take the men above. Aye, sir. Unless I have your word Leslie and I will be set free in the Bahamas-- I can't do that, Ben. You have five seconds to save this ship and its crew and cargo. Ben, if you surrender, I promise you that Leslie will go free. No charges will be brought against her. Oh, Ben, let me go free. We don't both have to die. Your five seconds are up. No, wait, Ben! Have you forgotten? We were going to be together always, in everything. You don't want to leave me now, do you? Oh, please, Ben. Do you love me? I do. Too much to part with you, my darling. Oh, Ben, please, let me live! Please, please, I want to live, Ben. Captain Marshall, the British! The Britannica, sir. She's driving off The Juniper and blockading the harbor. She'll be sailing after us next. Did you hear, Ben? A British ship. We're saved! How long before she gets to us? We're in shallow water now, but the tide's coming fast. I'd say about three hours. You may as well surrender, Captain Marshall. Have the crew stand by, ready to scuttle the ship. Aye, sir. No, no! The British will never take my ship or its cargo. Leslie! Potter, get the men off the ship as soon as you can. Aye, sir. Guard! Guard! Aye, Captain? Did you give Captain Marshall my message? -Aye, Captain. -Then why doesn't he come? He be kind of busy, Captain. But don't worry, he won't leave you down here when he sinks the ship. But if you get him before it's too late, he may not have to sink her. Did you tell him what I said, that he may not have to scuttle? Here he be. Tell him yourself. Oh, Jim! Jim! Did the guard tell you? You've got one chance, one chance in a hundred to save your ship. I can't make any deals with you, Ben. This time you can't help yourself. That submersible on deck was made for an emergency like this. If you can get it in operation while it's still dark, there's a chance you can knock out The Britannica. We haven't got anybody to run it. You've got me, Captain Marshall. You can't do it without me. One chance in a hundred, but if it succeeds, you save your ship, not to mention 10 million in gold bullion. What do you say, Jim? Guard, open up. Follow us in. After the explosion, pick us up. Aye, sir. These propellers should push us along at about two knots. This valve will let in enough water balance to keep us a few feet under the surface. We have to breathe through these two air vents. We'll make contact with The Britannica's hull. Light the fuse in this torpedo, ram it into the hull, then pedal backwards for our lives. How far can we get before she blows? About a hundred feet. That doesn't give us much leeway. It's enough. It'll have to be. Lower the hatch. A sea going coffin I calls it. Afraid you're right. We should make contact with The Britannica in about 17 minutes. We'll have to submerge for the rest of the way. Raise the hatch and get a fix on our direction. We have three quarter east. - Hold it! - directly ahead. We're ready to submerge now. Set the torpedo. What's our distance? About 500 feet. Watch the compass and keep us on course. We should reach The Britannica in 120 seconds. Still headed to ships. Stand by. We'll make contact any second. Get set. Ram her! We can't surface. The hatch! When she fills up, swim for it! Ben! Ben! We'll be home in Salem before nightfall, Captain. I'm filling out the log of The Concord. I've written Captain Waldridge died in the course of duty. Aye, aye, sir. Aye. Thank you.
