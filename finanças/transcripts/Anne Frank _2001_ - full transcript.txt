Somebody living in that building behind us. I know it. My wife cleans the offies. If there were people hiding, she'd know it. She thought she saw something one... but he turned out to be a salesman. Everybody's hiding somebody these days. What bothers me is that, uh...they may be Jews. Could be bad for all of us. You think Kugler's in on it? Kugler. Kugler's a liar. I know that already. That whole bunch in the office is always sneaking around. Kleiman says he has to go to the storeroom... the secretary's always heking reords... and the other one, that Miep... something about her I don't like. She's shifty, that one. What can you do? Firing Van Maarsen could be dangerous. If he suspets something... there is a hane he could go to the Gestapo. The reward for Jews has got up to twenty-five gelders a head. On the other hand, if the fellow's stealing... he's got something to hide as well. Yes, I think you're right. We have to be more autious from now on, all of us. That was our last hundred gelders. What are we to do for money now? One of those fany dresses of yours... should be worth something. I'd like to see you try. Stop being a ninny. Then don't speak to me that way. Whose fauIt is it we're in this pikle? Certainly not mine! Would you please stop arguing? You're like two magpies, always bikering ! I don't see you offering to help. -Listen to her! -Please, everyone. Ausations aomplish nothing. We'lI have to fend for ourselves... while you keep all the money from the business. Don't you think my Curly deserves a share of that money? Where would you all be without his preious nose? I tell you, still making jam ! See, I told you we should have taken in the Goslars. Oh, Edith, please. ls that so? Yes, it is. Oh, Mr. Pfeffer, would you mind waiting a moment? Would you please relay this to Mr. Van Pels? Tell him...ha. Tell him I await a response. Oh, yes, of ourse. If Mrs. Frank wants her linen bak, she can have all of it. I've never really ared for it. To be honest, I've always found it rather shabby, haven't you? And from now on, they can use their own hina. See how they like that. Thank you, Mr. Pfeffer. Very well. Be sure to put that in the letter. All right. We'll teah them to put on airs. Mr. Pfeffer, would you please ask Mr. Van Pels... to pass the salt to me? Ha ! At least it was one of theirs this time. It's all right. You shouldn't get into trouble on my aount. What do you think you're doing? Sit down ! Look at yourselves. You're supposed to know better. How do you think it makes us feel... me, Peter, and Margot, to see you behaving this way? A fine example you're setting. OTTO: She's right, you know. There's absolutely no plae for pettiness. Give me your plate. Would you like soup or porridge? Porridge, please. Mr. Pfeffer, would you be so kind... as to pass this porridge to Mr. Van Pels? Ha ha ha. Mr. Frank. Mr. Van Pels. Have some vegetables, Margot. Ah. Here's a joke for you, Anne. What has four legs and flies? Hmm? -Tell me. -Hmm? Ha ha ! A horse! Ha ha ha ha ! -What do you mean, a horse? -A horse! A horse can't fly. A horse-- with the flies at the tail. Hmm? Oh, don't be disgusting. -Oh, Putti. -I don't get it. What do you mean? Peter! It was announced from the broadcast station... at Cologne this evening that the whole of western Germany... is to be blacked out until further notice. Night raids have already caused severe damage... and President Roosevelt has repeated his request... that Allied planes refrain from bombing... civilians and unfortifii towns. Look how fast I'm growing, Daddy. Twenty-three, twenty-four... twenty-five, twenty-six... Ah-hoo! Mother says you should drink this. It's such a bother having the flu. I'm afraid to ough for fear someone might hear. I like the bells. I like to hear that there is life waiting for us. Margot, what do you miss most... about outside? I don't know. So many things. I long for everything. What? After the war, I'm going to live. I'm going to travel... study languages... go to Paris or London. Study history. I love history. That sounds romanti. You think I'm too extravagant? o. I've been thinking, too. I've been reading about Palestine. I'd like to see it... maybe be a nurse there. It's going to be different for us. We're going to be modern women. This is very kind of you, Miep. I wish there were more. There are not enough ration oupons. VICTOR: you don't need ration coupons for this. The supplier understandably... wishes to remain anonymous. Thank you very much. ALL: To vitory. -Thank you, Mr. Kleiman. -You're welome. You have no idea what it's like for me, Mrs. Gies. o one has any sympathy. Least of all that girl. They have each other, you see. I've no one. Only Charlotte. Oh, thank you, my darling. -Did she give you anything? -Mm-hmm. Oh. Thank you, and merry, merry Christmas. -Happy new year. -Thank you. Anne. Anne, I have something for you. -For me? -Mm-hmm. They're beautiful! I've never had high heels before. Well, I hope they fit. Here. -They fit. They fit. -They do? Wonderful. Oh. Let me see you walk. Here... What a beautiful young lady you've beome. Do you really think so? I do. It isn't easy for me to always look my best. He told me so. He said he liked my smile. You have a lovely smile. Miep, when you met Jan, did you know? Know? Oh, yes! I--I think I did. When? When he kissed me. Has Peter? Oh, no. I keep wanting him to, though. But I'm trying to be a lady about it. He will. How could he resist? Oh! VICTOR: Oh, I like this. JAN: Lovely. Red shoes! Ha ha. -Miep. -What you doing? -Putti. -Curly, no! Wait! Miep, how much... do you think something like this would fetch? Mr. Kleiman has a furrier friend. We can ask him. He just wants money for bloody igarettes! You think food is heap? You sold everything else, my best dresses and jewelry. Let me keep this at least. Enough, Putti. Anything you can do, Miep. You see what it's come to, Mrs. Frank? I won't have any fine things left. How am I going to fae people...after? Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, everybody. VICTOR: Merry Christmas. Must you go, Miep? Oh, Jan is waiting. Just a little longer, please? You hear how they all talk. After the war. I say nothing. What could I say to them? Mrs. Van Pels... everything a risis. Who is she to ritiize? The things she says about the children... the children. Anne. Margot. Otto says we must be hopeful. Hopeful for what? You mustn't think such things. I know. I know I have to be strong. But for how much longer? If only this waiting would end. At least I could be ertain. Miep... we're not going to make it. lt wilI have a bad end. I'm sure of it now. lt doesn't matter for me. But the children... The children, Miep--what's to beome of the children? HANNAH: Help me. Anne. Help me. Help me. -Hannah? -Please, help me. Hannah? Pim? I saw her. OTTO: Who? Hannah. It was so awful. The way she looked at me... I was so mean to her sometimes... and now there's nothing I can do to help her. Why not? Please tell me. It'sjust a bad dream. I hate them! The Germans--they won't stop... until they've killed all the Jews, will they? I wish all the Germans were dead ! Anne, listen to me. You must never think like that. There are good and bad people everywhere. lt makes no differene where they come from. What about Miep and Mr. Kugler? They're Austrian. Just like Hitler. You want them to die as well? o. And...don't forget. We are German. o. We're Duth, aren't we, Margot? Of ourse we are. I don't want to be German. ot ever. Here. Take your valerium. lt will make you feel better. o. Pim... let me sleep here tonight, please. OTTO: That's my girl. Mr. Frank, could you come down? Could you look at something for me, please? Oh, I'm desperate for a smoke. Maybe Kugler forgot some igarettes in the office. I'll join you. Uhh ! Halt! Halt, you ! The polie are oming. I need the toilet. lt'lI have to wait. You'll just have to hold it, Margot... for queen and ountry, freedom, truth, and right. This is no time for insolene. What about the radio? They're going to find the radio! Psst! ldiot! What differene does the radio make if they find us? I can still feel your heart beating. I thought we were lost. I could see the Gestapo taking us away. We're safe now. Miep... and Mr. Kleiman will be here soon. I prayed. Did you? Mm-mmm. I wouldn't have blamed God if he didn't listen. I never used to give him a thought. But he was wathing us. I know it. He's always wathing the Jews. He always will. Look. I'm glad we're here... together. Me, too. Listen, Peter. Aren't they beautiful? Mmm. They're telling us things are going to be all right. Sure. I must omplain in the strongest possible terms... about the new seurity measures. I'm sorry, Mr. Pfeffer, but downstairs is off-limits... until further notie exept for those with responsibilites. in this attic, Mr. Frank! But we are prisoners, Mr. Pfeffer. one of us can afford another enounter like the last one. -ow see here-- -It's been deided. ot by me. If the Allies knew about Mr. Pfeffer... maybe they'd be here already. We got-- And if we're not very areful... there's going to be a wedding on our hands. Do you know what this is, Hartog? If you have mie... you need a trap. I know where they're hiding. This is Armed Forces Radio. Today is the day. Today is D-day. At 0630 hours, Allied forces... under the command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower... landed on beaches throughout Normandy. Fighting is heavy, but victory is assured. To the people of Western Europe, we say... be strong, have faith, stand firm. 1944 will be the year ofyour liberation. My girls, we made it. Just think of it, Anne. We'll be bak in shool in Otober. Shool. -Hello. -Hello. I know there's going to be a elebration later, right? But I just want to be the first to say it. So happy fifteenth birthday. Oh, thank you, Peter. They're lovely. Miep bought them for me. Cost me everything I had. It's worth it to see you smile. What are you doing? Can't believe I was so innoent when I wrote some of this. I'm trying to make it better. I'm dreaming of turning it into a novel. Does it have a title yet? Maybe the... Blossomings ofan Ugly Duckling. Or The Seret Annexe. You must say something. Why make trouble? Van Maarsen won't say anything. He's got his reasons. What about the neighbors? Maybe they've heard something-- pipes, people talking. -God knows what. -I'm staying out of it. They'll ath you ! They'll find out you've been hiding from them ! Why didn't you report when you were supposed to? Have you thought about what will happen? Of ourse I've thought about it! How long will you wait? Until the Gestapo omes to take you away? What shall I do then? Who ares about a bunch of Jews? They've got it oming to them anyway. It's our lives I'm talking about, Lemmert. OTTO: There's fig ing at Caen. Aording to the reports... won't be long now. Do you think it's such a good idea... your spending so much time in the atti? Don't you think you should do your homework in your room? Daddy, you of all people know what Mr. Pfeffer's like. Your father's trying to say... that you're spending a little bit too much time with Peter. I don't understand. Are we doing something wrong? o, no. Um... it's just, uh... you enourage him a little too much, I think. You should set limits. Don't you like him? I think he has potential, yes. OTTO: But this is the wrong environment... for an infatuation... and I must say I'm not ertain I approve of all the neking. I hate that word ! Just don't take things too seriously. That's all we're asking. I think I'm old enough now to make my own deisions. Besides, he likes my smile. Ever sine I was little... I used to think my parents had the perfet marriage. I can't remember ever one hearing them argue. Daddy even used to serve Mummy breakfast in bed. I can't piture my father doing that for my mother. Probably hit him with the tray. Or vie versa. Mummy loves Daddy. I'm sure of that. But sometimes I think Daddy married her... beause he thought she would be a good wife. Do you see the differene? I asked Daddy about it one. You know what he said? "Your mother's very dutiful." Dutiful. I want so much more than that. I say... let the azis kill eah other. Less work for the British and the Russians. This time next month... We'll be having our Shabbat meal in freedom. This is not a meal. This is garbage. Your people could be doing more for us. Mr. Pfeffer, how could you say something like that? Have you thought about what would happen... if Miep were aught with one of your little pakages... from Charlotte? Now you even begrudge me my Charlotte. You think you're the only lonely person in the world? What's that supposed to mean? This modern household of yours. It's the same argument over and over again. Some people never learn. You could afford to take some lessons, too. You're selfish, you're hysterial, and you're pushy! I am not pushy! As if you were some ideal mother-- you can't even ontrol your own son. Wait a minute! -Just please be quiet! -Sit down ! Stop telling me what to do! Somebody's been a bad influene. I'm proud of you. I suppose I just finally had enough. It's a beautiful story. Do you really think so? Everyone would be amazed to know that you had this in you. People would just think I was being silly--or worse. Margot, do you remember the stories... Daddy used to tell us about the two Paulas? Of ourse. Good Paula and bad Paula. Everyone expets me to be bad Paula... so I try not to disappoint them. Good Paula's just for me. I keep her here. I don't let her out in publi. Well... why not show them who you really are? The good Paula's not strong enough. She hides and lets bad Paula do the talking... exept in my diary. Well, whihever one of you wrote this... I think it's very fine. You know, you are old enough to know by now. There's no harm in being yourself. I try, Margot. Really, I do. It's just other people keep getting in the way. Well, good night. Good night. Just a seond. Hello? I... I have information. lnformation? lnformation about what? About... about some Jews... at 263 Lindtstradt... somewhere in the bak building. Hey! What's the problem? Kenya. airobi? -Hungary. -Budapest. Where's the boss? Upstairs. Don't move. Don't even flinh. Arrest her. MA: Against the wall. You have been denouned. All right, you, let's go! Come! Valkyries? Those who foretell the future. ow show us what's behind that bookase. And what's orway? Oslo. ln. Gestapo. MA: Let's go! MAN: Nobody move! All right, get up, get up! -They're in here. -Hands up. MAN: Take them down! AE: Aah ! Move! quickly, quickly! All right, move. Move! Move! MAN: That's it. Money? Valuables? You'll find a strongbox in the loset. Go get it. Start paking. You've got five minutes. No. Bep, listen to me. I want you to go to my house. Tell my wife what's happened and don't come bak. Yes. Go now. There's no guard. OK. Go. Go. There's still time. You can go, too. o. I stay. It's all right, Mr. Pfeffer. You'lI see her again soon. I'm sure of it. Oh, Anne. What's in this trunk? othing of any value-- not to you. Memories. This is a soldier's trunk. Where did you get it? It's mine. Yes. I was a reserve offier in the first World War. But... But why didn't you register as a veteran? You would've been sent to Theresienstadt. You would've been treated deently. Take your time... Lieutenant. Finish your paking. MA: lnside. You, in here. Miep, see that you stay out of it. Salvage what you can. The Gestapo's here. Get rid of these. I think he's from Vienna. Go, go, go! I'm ready, Pim. So, you have nothing to say? Either one of you? o. othing. Well, now it's your turn. You're from Vienna. So am I. I heard it right away. Papers? You get out. Gies. Like the name of the business, yes? Strange that your husband isn't here. Have you no shame? SERGEANT: What am I going to do with you? As far as I'm onerned, you can stay here and rot. Consider it a personal favor. But if you leave, we'll seize your husband. You keep your hands off my husband. He has nothing to do with this. It's my affair. Don't be stupid. You're both in this up to your neks. We'll be back to check on you. God help you if you're not here. Bring them over here. quickly, move. All right, close it up. Come on. Get the keys, lok the plae up. o. You're not supposed to take anything. This is...Anne's diary. Bep, help me pik this up. Bep, help me. Quikly, before he omes bak. Where have they taken them? To Gestapo headquarters, I should think. After that... -lt was so awful. -Enough. Aren't you going to read it? o. This belongs to Anne. When she omes bak, I'll give it to her. Allprisoners proceed to the platform. No talking. All prisoners proceed to the platform. No talking. MAN: Seven, eight, nine, ten... eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen... MA: Welome to the Jerusalem of Holland. Registration is at the far end. Just follow the rowd. We're allJews here. The Germans let us run the place. That's "S" Barracks. Watch out you don't end up there. The place is a little dirty... but we've got everything you need... to make yourselfcomfortable... and we've got lots of work to keep you busy. What are we going to do? We're already filled up. It's no good. Things don't look so bad. Make ourselves useful. Stik it out. Next. Name? Frank. Otto Frank. This is my wife Edith... and my daughters Anne and Margot. "S" Barraks. OTTO: Ifl may, I'd like to request... that my daughters be assigned to kithen duties. I can do anything. I'm very handy. o privileges for riminals of "S" Barraks. OTTO: May I ask of what crime we're accused? Failure to report to an order. ext. -It's not a rime, sir. -Next. -It's not a rime, sir. -ext. lt doesn't make us criminals, sir. So then FredAstaire takes Ginger Rogers... in his arms, and they dance and dance and dance. Wath it. Work. Before the war, she went to every movie she could. I can't wait to see all the pitures I missed. Thanks to all the magazines... she already knows all the plots by heart. They can't touch us. I heard one of the other women talking. She said the Allies have taken Paris... and they're marhing through Belgium now. ls that the latest from the JPA? What's the JPA? The Jewish Press Ageny. Every day, a different rumor. The Allies are here, there, everywhere. They say there hasn't been a transport in two months. -Maybe there's hope. -There's always hope, Janny-- as long as we work hard. That's my father's motto-- work and hope. And then Mrs. quackenbush began to quack. She quacked and she quacked and she quacked. "Stop that infernal quaking..." cried the swan... and he put his wings over his ears. But Mrs. quackenbush did not stop-- not until the big black swan flew away. She waited to see if the swan would come back... but he never did... so she gathered her ducklings around her... and together they swam off happily ever after. And do you know what they sang? Quak, quak, quak! That's right. "Quak, quak, quak." They love your stories. Do you think we could arrange for me to visit more often? I'll try. They don't have parents to tell them stories anymore. When we're liberated... I'm going to get all the paper I can find... and start my stories over again. Did I tell you I was working on a novel? o. I don't think so. Well, I was. I didn't know how to finish it, but now I do. I can't wait to get started again. It's going to be a romane, but not sentimental, mind you. I've grown too old for that. Do you remember how you told me one... how you were ashamed of being Jewish? Mm-hmm. The hosen people. Chosen for what? This? We've suffered before, and it's only made us stronger. One day, people will look up to us. Yeah, if there are any of us left. I used to take so much for granted... like the sky. Do you see those stars? We had a lub alled the Little Dipper one-- Jaque, Hannah, Sanne, and me-- one star for eah of us. And whih one were you? That one. Mm-hmm. Well, I should've known. Tomorrow, a transport will leave this amp. -Quiet! - The O.D.s are preparing lists. lnmates seleted for this transport... will be allowed to take with them... all belongings surrendered upon arrival. I look forward to personally seeing you off... and wishing you bon voyage. Back to your barracks now! There must be something you can do. You've got to keep us off their lists. There isn't a string in this amp I haven't tried to pull. The only language they understand is barter. We've got nothing to trade. I'm not sure it would do any good even if we had. The Jew traitors here are worse than the azis... saving their own skins. In their plae, you'd do something different? Ach. We're like Job, waiting in the ashes while they play God. o. lt was different for Job. Job didn't have to squat like an animal... in front of strangers... Job was not driven from his homeland... and Job could argue bak. Attention ! Get in line! Step forward when your name is alled. Brandes, Janny. Lubinsky, lsaa. Brandes, Lientje. Frank, Otto. Frank, Margot. Frank-Hollander, Edith. Van Pels, Hermann. Frank, Anneliese. MAN: Van Pels, Peter. Van Pels-Rutgen, Auguste. Pfeffer, Fritz. Come outside there. lt doesn't make any sense. Anyone with brains can see the Germans are losing the war. What can we matter to them now? othing makes sense anymore, Mr. Pfeffer-- not to me. As long as my family stay together. Stay together. Come on, come on. All right, now. Do you have your report cards? Let me see them. Make sure you give them to the teaher at the next amp. Yes, I will. We will. CROWD: Ohh ! Still in Germany, I think. I'm not sure. Everywhere just looks bombed to piees. Well, it's something, anyway. Maybe they bombed the traks. That's possible, isn't it, Mr. Frank? Yes, it's possible. I'm going to take off the red pathes. Wherever we're going... we are not going as ommon riminals. BOY: No! Mama! Aah ! Don't let go! Peter! Peter! o, no! Peter! o! AE: Pim ! Pim ! Pim, come bak! Pim ! Anne! Pim ! Margot! o! Pim ! Pim ! Pim ! Anne! Father! Pim ! Pim ! Hey, come on ! Did you say good-bye to your father, your brother? You won't see them again. They are in the gas chambers. - Don't listen to her. -Shut up, you. Line up! Women seleted for this transport... will be sent to a work amp to work on munitions. If they ask your age, say sixteen. Transport. Transport. Transport. Transport. Age? Sixteen. Sabies. You're staying here. OFFICER: Send her to Crosse Block. I'm staying with my daughter. I have sabies, too. Move along. I talked to Anne last night. The dotor said they could leave that horrible plae. When? Today, she said. And the sun is shining. It's dangerous for them there. I should've gone with them. The sabies blok-- there has been a seletion. The children? Here. Here. Margot, what has happened? Aah ! This way. Lientje? Janny? Anne? Margot. Thank God. Ohh. Listen, Margot. Birds. I've forgotten about birds. You never saw them in Birkenau. othing lived there. Birds of prey. Savengers. That's all that's left. That's the Star Camp. They are saving those Jews... to exhange them for German prisoners. They have food over there. Better be areful. If they ath you, they'll shoot you. I'll kill you, you thieving bith ! Mrs. Van Pels? Oh, to find you here after all these weeks... months... Your mother was beside herseIf with grief... when she heard about the transport. She didn't come with you? Seleted. Every day, there were trains. It was because ofthe Russians is what I heard. Only sixty miles away... they're emptying all the Polish amps. We don't believe in rumors anymore. Oh, can't you make her stop? Typhus. You'll get used to it. You get used to everything. Anne. Anne. Anne, wake up. There's somebody on the other side of the fene... and I think it's your friend Hannah. -Hannah? -Hannah. The other side. Hannah. Hannah. Hannah. Hannah. ls it really you? What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Switzerland. lt was only a story so they wouldn't come looking for us. We were hiding in Daddy's office. I couldn't tell anybody. Gabi. ls she here? She had an infection, but she's all right now. Someone's taking are of her. It's father I'm worried about. He's so sick. They took him to the hospital. I pray for him every night. I used to pray for you, too, Anne. I prayed that your family was safe. I have no family. Only Margot. your father? your mother? My father's dead. They sent him to the gas chambers. But your mother? Seleted. The chimney was smoking so black. It's too horrible. I can't believe it. They've taken everything, Hannah. Everything. It's so cold here. The lie are rawling over my lothes. There's no food. Everything I find I give to Margot beause she's so weak. We got a Red Cross pakage today. It isn't much, but it's something. Wait. Anne. I'm here. I'll throw it over. Be careful. Aah ! -Anne? -Aah ! What's happening? Anne? Tell me! She took it. She took my food ! HANNAH: I'll try again if I can. Come bak tomorrow. Please try. Please try. Yes, I promise. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. I got it. Oh, soks. Thank you. Thank you so much, Hannah. Meet me here. ot tomorrow, but the next day. HANNAH: Wait for me. I'll wait. I have so much I want to tell you. Me, too. I have to go. The guards. Until then. Socks. Put this in your mouth. Mery... o! Go away. HANNAH: Anne? Anne, are you there? Can you hear me? Anne? I'm sorry I couldn't meet you the way I said I would. They told us we were going to be exhanged. Finally, after all this waiting. You should've seen father. He got dressed in his best suit, even in the hospital. He... he died in that suit. And now they say we're not going to be exhanged after all. Why are they so ruel? You're the only person I have left to talk to. You and Gabi, but she's not old enough to understand yet. I don't understand. Oh, Anne. Where are you? WOMAN: Anne? What's happened? Where are your lothes? I threw them away. I feel the lie rawling all over me... ithing--ithing all the time. I'll try to organize something for you. Whih barrak are you in? One of these. You have to come. You have to come. Margot is very sik. Everyone's sik. My sister, too. I'll come when I can. ow get bak inside. Take some bread. Do you remember how... how I was always taking are of you when you were little? It's my turn to take are of you now. lt doesn't matter anymore. o. You can't leave me here. Tell me a story, Anne. I used to...I used to love your stories. Pim's stories were always much better than mine. Poor Pim. Well, you're still going to be a writer there, won't you? And he'd like that. Do you remember how we talked about it? About...about what we were going to do... after the war? What were you going to be? I can't--I can't remember. Yes, you can. You have to. A nurse. That's what you told me. That's right. A nurse. A nurse in Palestine. Paris or London, that's where I'm going. See the world. See the world. Birds. Listen, Margot. Margot. Margot. o, you'll wake her! Mr. Frank. Miep. It's good to see you. And Edith? She's not oming bak. Let's go inside. After we were liberated by the Russians... I found someone who had known Edith in the women's amp. Starvation. She was hoarding bread under her blanket in the hospital... for her children and her husband she said. OTTO: Ifher body had only held out for two more weeks. I'm sorry, Mr. Frank. The azis dynamited the gas hambers, you know... to over their traks. That wasn't enough for them. That's when the marhes began. I begged Peter not to go, to stay behind. He was looking after me then. I don't know what happened to him... or to Mr. Pfeffer. Mr. Van Pels I saw with my own eyes... being taken to the gas hamber. He was in the barraks when he should've been at work. He... He just gave up. And you can never do that. ever. And the girls? Do you have any news? Only rumors. So many of the women were deported to Germany. I live in hope. Have you seen-- ls this the Bergen-Belsen list? You. I need to speak to you. I'm looking for information about my daughters. They were sent to Bergen-Belsen. You have to fill out a form. I have filled out a form. I've filled out five forms. We can add their names to a list, then we'll ontat you. Their names are Anne Frank and Margot Frank... WOMAN: Does it say if they were transferred? My name is Janny Brandes. I was in Bergen-Belsen with Anne and Margot Frank. Do you have any information? Follow me. WOMAN: Who is it? Mrs. Brandes? JANNY: Yes. Otto Frank. I believe you saw my daughters at Bergen-Belsen. Come in. Miep. Margot and Anne are not coming back.
