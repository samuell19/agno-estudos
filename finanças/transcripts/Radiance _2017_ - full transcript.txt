Test, test... How is the earphone's sound? Hikari (Radiance) "A test to check your earphone and tune it." Light turning green... Office worker yawning... Truck driving in a bus lane... Carrying a ladder, crossing the street... Rushing while checking the clock... Guiding people at the bus stop... Coming up to stand in line... Bus stopped, people getting off... Children crossing the street... Noticing a boy who doesn't raise his hand... Kids making fun of someone... Middle-aged women and office workers waiting... A bit tired of waiting... Waiting for a taxi with a stern face... Explaining the way... Woman with glasses... Station, Nanto Bank board... Bus and taxi stop signs... Waiting for the light to turn green... Going to work, to school... Fiddling with his phone with his left hand. Suspicious driver... Autumn, early morning, beyond the trees a quiet bay... House with a tiled roof. Motor board on the ocean. This is Juzo's house... Big tree seen from the veranda... Gray-haired man, unshaved... Juzo is folding the laundry... How are you, Tokie? You're quiet. Tokie, no makeup, a lock of her black hair on her shoulder... From the veranda stares at the garden... I'm bored... Looking absentmindedly. Suddenly Tokie coming to life... Are you going to stay there long? His hands stop, he looks at her tenderly. Excuse me? Yes. Juzo stares at her back. She is alone in that big living room... Juzo remembering the sea... Sand statue on the beach... Juzo and Tokie seated in the veranda... Juzo, holding a glass of wine, one sip... You told me the that already. Right? Putting the glass on the table... You remember? Tokie, a blank look... Tokie impassive... It's fine. You're the only one who forgets... As for me, not a single... I'm cold. Tokie quivering... Poking her cheek... Tokie, raising her had to the sky... He raises his head, looks at the sky... A mackerel sky. Alright, we'll stop here. So, Masako, what do you have? Right. Wait, I'm still immersed into that mackerel sky... I'll talk first then... Well, let's follow the order... About Tokie's .... Well it may seem insignificant... Her hair wasn't just black, it was 'pure black', I'd like to say... Black hair... What was on that bay? I would like to know more... It's a sand statue. That word 'sand statue' sounded so unfamiliar... It is a sand statue representing a woman. This is the image... It could have been anything. The sand was expected on the beach but a statue... Was that a full size standing statue? It is about 50 cm... A nude, sitting cross-legged, one knee up... One elbow resting on that knee... Her hair tied up, facing us. That scene now really took shape and character. Let me review this, sorry. Ocean... Sun barely piercing through the thick clouds... Seagulls flying. Tokie wearing a snow white dress... Lying on the beach... Juzo hanging over her. I miss you. He's caressing her hair... Kiss on the side of her mouth... Even holding you in my arms, I still miss you. Holding her tight with an expression of sadness. They're inexhaustible... My thoughts are inexhaustible... Even as my love fades away before me... She is beautiful... An expression ... Bent over, walking in silence. He gazes as if suddenly seeing Tokie for the first time... Sand on his face... Wet eyes... An expression of hope for the life to come. I saw that sun barely piercing through the thick clouds. That was great ... Well, if I may... You offered so many descriptive details. They triggered numerous feelings... Ah right, yes... It seemed that through that window in the house... Many things were popping up... I was surprised, wondering where the wall was. You probably tried to say something ... You're Miss ishida, right? You're talking to me? You said "accompanied by numerous feelings" Well, don't read too much in it. But you felt you were imposed, didn't you? I wouldn't go so far... Since she offered so many details... It helped to sense the space... Since there were so many words... It was a lot. For example? "Seeing Tokie for the first time" For example. "an expression of hope" For example. You just made that up. Uh? To say it plainly... You were encumbering the experience. Do you have to be so blunt? I was just trying to... Help everyone. And that was oppressive, can't you see? It should be noted that Mr. Nakamori as opposed everyone else... Has still some of his eyesight. I get it . Next time we have a screening... I'll try not to impose... I'll chose my words carefully... And spare Mr. Nakamori. There. Thanks a lot. Fine weather. You see, Mr. Nakamori's attitude... It's better to confront him, I think. Most people are so grateful for the details you offer... They don't object to anything. Isn't the aim of cinema... To connect you with other people's lives? It helps me to live other people's experience by proxy. The vocal explanations... Offer the cinema... To people who can't see and help them connect too. You see Misa, as a vocal guide... You get to understand their imagination... And the imagination of sight-challenged people is phenomenal. Right. Made of sand ... A woman made of sand... (movie script) A woman made of sand... Let's go to the ocean, you and me. Tokie gives him a charming look and kisses his wounded finger... He turns to Mr. Ida who is studying go. Have you ever thought about suicide Mr. Ida? You see, I should have died long ago. I took Tokie along... Tokie, What are you going? I need to go back home... But you live here with me. This is your only place... Let's go. Don't touch me. Miss Misa, could we meet this week? Mrs. Aki? Miss Misa. -It's been a while. How are you? -There. Kaki fruit, I bought them on the way. First of the season. Thank you. So considerate for a you person. My daughter isn't like that. How has it been lately? Good times and bad times, it's irregular. He can be disoriented. It's hard to forget that day when he ran away... This is such a burden. What would we do without you. Don't worry, I'm doing my utmost. Right. Thanks a lot. -It's fine. However... But you should start to consider ... The care of an institution. Mom, are you happy? Sure... As long as you are. There are so many sounds here... When I close my eyes... I hear even better. Dad's bag... Can I keep it a while? Driver's license, valid until 1996. Cash: $72.23 Ticket to Obanaza hotspring. Receipt from the supermarket. Lunchbox $3.96. Drink $0.97. Coffee, 185ml can, $0.64. Appointment at the osteopath​ clinic, telephone card... Discount coupon. I remembered all of Dad's items. Call section chief​ Ikeda. "Calling section chief​ Ikeda" Yes, Ikeda speaking. It's Nakamori, How are you? I'm glad you're still at your office. What? Tell me. I'm inquiring about the bug we had on the CPU board. Ah, thanks to your quick reaction we had it fixed, thank you. We'll send you the verification result this morning. Alright then, you mean tomorrow morning, right? Excuse me Mr. Nakamura, it is 9 am now. What? It's not the evening. Sorry, I thought we were in the evening. You've been working all night? You're amazing. I wish you gave me some of that focusing power... Do you ever sleep? OK, I'll call you later. Thank you, I'll be expecting your call. A fine weather. No, the weather is not fine. "Even as my love fades away before me..." "she is beautiful." "My thoughts are inexhaustible..." What is it? I'm taking pictures. -Pictures ? Look this way. Cheese. Where are you? There's two of you? He was a famous photographer. Although he would not admit it. "A photographer is like..." "a hunter who choses time as a prey." "Knowing how small I am and how big the world is..." "I'll keep meeting it while breathing with discretion." His quote. -Yeah. I seems his grandpa was a cameraman... I heard. Tomoko. -Yes? May I borrow it? Sure. Thank you. You can keep it. You don't have to. But I need something in return. Can I tell you my request? Hello. Yes. On the 23rd, OK... Yes. Already, in the studio on the 23rd... Thank you very much . Goodbye . What is it? I got an appointment . Really ? -Yes. You're so lucky, few director's accept interviews . Did you recommend me? I didn't. What is your request? Hi. I'm Osaki... From White Light. Right. Excuse me? I brought the document magnifier. Right. Thank you. Thank you. Well, my place is kind of messy. I can offer you a tea... please. It's beautiful. Come in. Oh... don't move. I'll do it. Did you hurt yourself? I'm sorry about that. It's OK. You trashed this by mistake. Uh? It's from Mr. Kotowa, about a room for a wedding... It's OK. Hey, that hotel is great. It's designed for blind people. That's not the point. You don't get it. You don't get it. I told you I don't want it. Felt good. What was that? -Nothing. What? -What? You did something. Didn't. What are you doing? Who do you know salt from pepper? Told you not to touch it. What animals do you like? Uh? OK, I'll tell you their names. Pig. Tiger. Elephant, giraffe, bear... Rabbit, chick, panda... Chick... Chick. So, What? Give me your left hand. That one with a sticker is salt. How about that? Get it. But... And now it will be on the right in the tray. Beautiful. What? This room with the sun coming from the west... Is so beautiful. As much as possible... I always rented sunny apartments . Sun rays flowing... Into the whole room... Hitting the rainbow prisms. Misako, covering it with her hand. Even in her palm. The prisms are rainbow-ing. How is it? Not bad. It's beautiful . Uh? When I lower my head... You think I can't see, right? Right. But I see this way. Uh? But... When I look ahead... I can't see. Is that so? That letter earlier... Was from my ex. I was married long ago. An invitation to her wedding... Hey. Eat your yakisoba. Light turning red. Crossing the street. Stepping only on the white stripes. Misako walking on the pathway for the blind. It's scary... It's so difficult. Good. You found something? -It's fine. You were the director of this movie... Yes. Does the character, Juzo, express something that is close to you? Well... Not in an obvious manner... But sure, in a way it is true. In what way does it meet your experience? For one, I'm an old man. What I wrote for the last scene... How is it? Precisely, for that scene... I need to say something about the narration... It's there... That expression. Of hope for the life to come. It's not good? It's not that it's not good. Juzo ... may be dead tomorrow. Uh? Since he's an old man... He he he... you see? The desire to live... Doesn't prevent death... And even close to death... One desire to live. See? It's human. It's odd, right? Reaching this age... The border between life and death gets blurred. For that last scene... See... How can I express it? Juzo thinks about his death but... Whether he lives or he dies... He has transcended the concern for these... If we could lift that ambiguousness... For the sake of the movie... I'd like hope to prevail... Director , it's time. Uh? Sorry, gotta go. Miss Osaki... I'm so glad I met you. I'd be so grateful if you imparted that hope to Juzo. Bye-bye. The rain is falling harder. Goodness, what a shower. The sand hills... Juzo, wrapped in his coat, climbing in silence. Inexhaustible. My thoughts are inexhaustible. Juzo walking away, bent over... Going in silence. Bright sun shining over his shoulder... A the top of the dune, Juzo stops... He gazes at the sky without flinching... Alright. Yeah, if we compare with the previous time. It is thoroughly organized, it flows smoothly... You introduced intervals... It's emotional... With the slow and steady​ sequence of the scenes... I think you did a great job. Thank you. You did a tight narration this time. It's fitting the movie well, it's great. As for me... This narration... Yes? First someone saw it for the first time... He'd think it's awful. Awful? The top scene, Juzo's workshop... Your expression was minimalist... As it is... It renders no sense of space. All of us here are maybe getting too used to that work. Maybe I edited out too much. I get it. I'll review the top scene. If I may ask something... You created that narration from the entire movie... What did you get, what did you feel... When you made that narration? What did I feel? What you feel the movie entails... The perception that flows from that movie. What would that be? In his works, director Kitabayashi... Projects much of his personal experience ... That inner ... How can I say... He doesn't try to get one message through... But if it is expressed, he's glad. And with that in mind I wrote the narration. And as you aimed at this expression ... And strives to have us perceive it... The weigh that this movie carries. You have unfolded its depth. What you expressed here was about the overall... The beauty that is ruined and the sadness in that movie. Etc. Things that, however hard you try, you will never recover. I felt there was a very heavy side to the story. And when we watch that movie... More than a perception by proxy of the screen... It felt that we entered a much bigger world... And you made it pleasurable. We entered into a bigger world. A place that invites you in . -Right. And suddenly you look around and you're there. Suddenly. It is inside me, I breathe the same air... Hear the same sounds... Feeling so many things, I watched that movie. You see Miss Misako, Cinema lives in a vast world... And in the face of that vastness, our words are small... But we shouldn't deplore it. Next... The last scene... After the sunset... You didn't say anything. I considered several options. For the last scene, people who see it... I rather leave it to them. A weird narration would lead people astray. You ran away. It's not like that. It's just that... I simply removed my personal feelings. Is that right? As for me I didn't feel anything. That's when imagination fails. Uh? I'm always observing... In the facial expression of the audience... I believe they have an answer... But your facial expression stays the same. And that doesn't depend on seeing or not... I'm just wondering if you're deprived of imagination. Misako, easy. Mr. Nakamori. Mr. Nakamori. Are you running away. I think we can end it here. Excuse me. Thank you . -Thank you . We'll call you for the next screening, thank you. Misako, you can go for today. I'm taking the situation from here. Maybe, you can wonder which one lacks imagination. Let's go . -Right. Don't go. Mr. Nakamori. This way, please. Good evening. -Good evening. It's been a while. We haven't seen you in six months. Possibly. We met then. Right, you and me. You guys do this regularly? A party at the office. -Business related. A drink? -What are you guys drinking? Beer. -I'll have one too. Please, three beers. What have you been doing? -Bikini models. Ain't it great. I meet many cute girls. Beautiful. Here come the beers. Great, thank you. Thanks. Thank you. There you are. Cheers. Your back from work, Onishi, right? Last night I came back from Okinawa. Okinawa, Really? For a bikini shooting. You often have these jobs. Can't choose. You don't have a say. I'm not like Nakamori. -How is that? By the way. There. It's Radiance, right? I'd better start covers soon too. Really? He really did a Radiance cover? It represents a kind of elf of the woods... You need to use your imagination more... My imagination. -Don't worry about it. The photo has a green basis. A woman is alone in the woods... She's just standing there... And the character, the object, the surroundings... The light, the shades, the wind... Their all well balanced... Everything comes to perfection. In an instant of unity. I guessed that such was his intention. You sound like a good salesman. -No, no. How is your sight lately, Mr. Nakamori? Same, same. You're not shooting anymore? How would I? You mean, it won't heal? Right. But medicine could make progresses. No idea. You serious? It must make you mad? I'm not mad... I can't imagine. You're brave. What do you want? I want it back. What? I want it back. What's wrong with you? What do you want? My camera. Give me back my camera. I don't have it. This is my heart. Even if it can't beat anymore. It is my heart. Enough with that. It's time to let go. Mr. Nakamori. I'm Osaki. What happened to you? I can't see... It's here... Uh? Would you ... Let me... Touch your face? Mr. Nakamori. That place ... In the countryside... Where you took the photo... Of that sunset... Would you go there... With me? Please. Alright. Are you OK? I'm fine. I don't want to forget . Not even an instant. I want to see everything. Every moment for ever. I miss you. Even holding you in my arms... I still miss you. They're inexhaustible... My thoughts are inexhaustible... Love me in the sand... Love me in the sand. Even as my love fades away before me... She is beautiful. He gazes at the sky... Without flinching... Bright ... Setting sun... Tomorrow... The place of the setting sun... Together... "Your messages." Hello, it's Ikeda... The technical document I sent you the other day... Could you check it? I'd like to hear your opinion about several points... Thank you very much, talk to you later. It's Koyanagi... How have you been? There's something I'd like to discuss. If you could advise us for the private showing of the work. I'll call you later, bye. It's Kane, How are you? What's going on? we haven't been able to reach you. Really, are you still alive? You have one unread text message. Osaki Misako. So this is the place. Though I know I'll never catch it up... I love to chase the sun. How can I hold this dazzlingly beautiful light. I chased the sun all the way... Until it sank. I too... I too chased it. So much more than a long time ago... My heart was creaking... Sometimes. I heard. The creaking of your heart... Just like me. When I finally see the unseen... When I was irritated... Why? But... For this last screening I think the audience will like it. You did a great job. It was a difficult movie to explain. Could I have a little more time for the last scene? I can't find words. We see with the audience schedule and decide. How was it? The most important thing... He had to get rid of the most important thing... This is so painful. Mr. Nakamori? Walking on a line... Chasing... Without catching up... The cold handrail... Vibration sent to the body... Scared... Yat-chan. It's Misa-chan. Where's Mom? -Misa-chan. Misa-chan. Where's Mom? Misa-chan. I arrived to open this morning, she was gone... She hadn't touched her dinner either... She was probably gone last night already. The whole village launched a search party. Misa-chan. Misa-chan. Papa. Papa. Look, that big mountain there. Dad's tree. Let's take a picture so we don't forget. We'll make sure we don't forget. Where does the sun go when it sets? Mom. Mom. Hey, Misa-chan. Welcome back. It's getting cold, don't you think? Mom. Why? What are you doing ? What? Dad is coming back... When the sun... Will be setting within the mountains... Dad is coming back. The clouds look like smoke... I'm scared. Let's get back. "This is my last picture, it's for you." "Earphone test." A view on Hamanako Bay... A hazy gray sky... On the opposite shore a range of hills... The ocean is seen through a thick row of trees ... The charming tiled roof of a Japanese house... The veranda is opened on the garden... A white boat losing speed as it approaches the shore. Inside an unlit room. Outside the window a light clouded sky... In the alcove a red spider lily. Juzo interrupts his task to look at Tokie. You remember? Well, it's fine... On your side you forget everything... But for me, not a single memory... I'm cold... You're cold? Juzo takes a scarf with light orange prints... And wraps firmly Tokie's neck... We see Juzo's face coming closer to her face. A tear drops from her eye... I miss you... Juzo encircles Tokie's throat with his hands ... Nervously he caresses her hair, her cheek. Even when I hold you in m y arms... He kisses her neck... Her eyes are empty... I still miss you. He ruffles her hair... It's inexhaustible... My thoughts are inexhaustible... Love me in the sand... Love me in the sand... Beaching waves foaming snow white... Gray clouds wrapping the sun like a bell... Facing the ocean, Juzo is holding up the scarf in the wind... The waves are powerfully billowing. He drops the scarf that disappears in the waves... Even as my love fades away before me... She is beautiful. The sand statue of a woman collapses... Without leaving a trace... By little steps, Juzo walks up the dune... His beige coat is floating in the wind... Juzo walking away, bent over... A bright sunset... Is shining over his shoulder... Mr. Nakamori. Coming. -Wait. I know now... Even if you don't chase me... Or try to find me, it's OK... I will... I will come to you. So, wait for me there. Juzo stops at the top of the hill... He stares at the sun without blinking... Juzo is gazing. That radiance...
