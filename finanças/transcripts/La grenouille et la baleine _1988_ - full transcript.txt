- You feel OK, my sweet? You want me to drive? - : Stop it! I'm not due for eight months! - YEAH! Have you ever seen any place so beautiful? My father was right. Taste the salt, the sea air! Don't you feel the power? - Can't beat it. - If you Love me, your love Winning tide On the open sea Where breakers crash And tall ships dash - You should sing on the radio. - Really? Thanks a lot. And you'll love to hear this song From me - I could switch it off, I mean. - Some people. Jealous! Somewhere... Julie, stop! Down there. By the rock. - Michael... - Go on back to the village. Get help. We've gotta hurry. GET OXYGEN! - A child's drowning! A child's drowning back down the road, maybe half a mile! - "Three sharp breaths "into the mouth... "making sure that the air is penetrating." - A child's drowning! I need help! - Don't worry. It's just my sister. - "Second... necessary... to clear the air passages." "Third... "As quickly as possible, get the... "get the victim... "the victim out of the water and back to the... solid ground." - Miss! - Yes? - What if I said I've seen a child drowning? - Oh, dear. Well, this must be your first visit here, right? - Please, be quiet! Hello. - Hello. What are you doing? - I'm recording. - Re... recording what? - Recording my whale. They're singing! Don't believe me? - Well... - Listen for yourself, then. Put your ears in the water. Both ears. - Both ears. - Did you hear it? - I'm afraid not. - Listen. Try with them. - Are those really whales singing? - Not just whales, humpbacks! Oh, humpbacks have humps, but they also have bumps... on their nose! Like pickles! It's sort of cute. - It's astounding. You'd think they were right here next to us. - They're at least 3 or 4 miles away. In the water, you can hear more clearly. Sound travels better there than in the air. Really! - I never heard anything quite like it. - It's music. - You know, I thought you were dead. - What?! - How'd you get to be such a good swimmer? - I was born in water. It must've come naturally. I swam before I crawled, Mom says. - You're a mermaid. - I don't have a tail! It's Grandpa! Grandpa Toby! - Ah! - Grandpa Toby! - Oh! - Tadpole! Look at you. - Did you arrive today? - The day before yesterday. - Came back home with the whales. - Put the rest of the gear on board. I'll be right there. - That's my friend. His name's Michael. - Hmm? - Michael, come here! - Huh? Hello, sir. - You look to me like a Longworth. Ted's side of the family. - Yes. He's my grandpa. - Ah ha ha! - You're from here, then? - My father came from here. - Oh, you've gotta stay longer this visit! - How about a month? - Great! - I brought that television crew. They chartered my boat to make a film about the humpbacks. - There are a lot of them here, you know. At least six already! - You've seen them? - I heard their songs. They're out around New Island. - You'll come have a look? - Promise. - I never knew whales could talk. - Well, they can. They tell each other stories, funny ones they've been telling 100 million years. Sometimes, they tell each other about where the ships are going. Or often, they talk about their children. - Come on. How'd you learn all that? - I listen. Grandpa Hector! - Hello, Tadpole! Enjoying your vacation? - You bet! - Good morning. - How are you, sir? - Michael's staying for a month at Old Manor. Him and his wife, they're both here! - Ah. - How many grandpas do you have? - Oh, he's not really my grandpa. Neither is Grandpa Toby. They're brothers. Old Manor over there belongs to Grandpa Hector. My mom and dad have worked for him since I was little. - And Grandpa Toby? - Oh, he's a captain. He's been sailing forever. He sailed his boat around the world at least 10 times already! - Oh, and he takes the lead! - This is a tree, one of our bonsais. It's small, yet almost 12 years old. - You mean it stopped growing, that's it? - It won't have stopped growing, it's just that it-- - Julie! Julie. - Excuse me. - It's OK. - : That's Julie. - Oh, she's pretty! - Oh! - Did you worry? - A bit, but people told me what was going on. I hear they call you Tadpole. - Yeah. - Just wait 'til you see our room. - You wait 'til you hear our humpbacks. - Oh, here! Take the recorder. OK, see you later! - Great, thanks. - Bye. What is this? - Listen. - Daphne! Now, what have you done? - I didn't do a thing, Mom! It was his idea to save me. - It's beautiful. - What are you up to? - I'm doing a test. - It's... it's... it's... it's... - It's special. - Yeah, right! It's special. Let's see. There's one I... No, no. Now, this one. - You hear that? - Looks good. Two more will be fine. OK? Liz, time to add the carrots. Start with those and call me if you want more. OK? - Thank you. - Smells good, but... the guests come first. - I could save a little for you! - Lorraine... Could we talk for a minute? - OK. Girls, I'm leaving for a minute. - Elvar! Elvar... I love you. Yes, I do. And we were just talking about you. - Lorraine, I've made an important decision. - You've finally decided to get married? - I've decided to sell Old Manor. - Sell Old Manor? - I'm sure that you'll like him. He's fun! His name is Michael. Can you say Michael? Michael. Michael. Try to say Michael after me, Elvar. Michael! Nope, not I love you. Michael. Oh, you're hungry, huh? - She's not moving a bit, so she has to be dead. Suddenly, she jerks up, dripping wet, hair covering her face! She says, "Quiet!" And starts to laugh that wonderful laugh. - You fell in love, I suppose? - Yeah, I fell... in the water, though. - Your top's inside-out. - Oh. Then she showed me how to listen to the... What are you doing? Oh, neat. You think maybe... - He hears it? - Uh-huh. - Could be. Listen. - It's great, huh? - Mm-hmm. - It sounds like the voice of a heartbroken mermaid. Let's go! - That way? - Oh. - You're hopeless. - Coming or not? - Sure, I am. - Look! You wanna see them or not? - Right, OK! - Come on. She told me Elvar comes north in the summer, and goes south every fall. I guess both he and Daphne go back to schools again after the holidays are over. - How old is he? - He was 11 in March. - Michael! Look at the flower! - He was 11 in March. Same as Daphne. - It's beautiful! Smile. Oh, good one! - Are you listening? - Yeah, sure. - No, you're not! - OK, I'm sorry! Go on. - Well anyway, he was 11 in March, same as Daphne. And she's sure they were both born on the tenth. - Michael, come on! - Why do I bother? - Wait! You may as well take the time to smell them. Come closer! Smell! Super, huh? - Hm. Sure, great. Come on. - No! Take my picture, will you? Our picture. - Smile. - Cheese! - It's time to go. Let's not keep her waiting. I think it's over that way. OK? - Michael! Listen! You could at least wait for me! - Oh! Thank you! Thank you, Elvar. Oh! I want you to meet Michael. He's over there. Go on over. Go say hello. - Hello. - Hello. - Ah! - Hi. - Aww! - Look at this! He's laughing at me! Hey, you! - : Aw, look! - It's an enormous project. They want to put in a golf course and build a huge new marina down in the cove. They've even asked for a permit to operate a casino! - What have you done, Hector? Those businessmen don't belong here. You built all this. Your whole life's here! - Exactly 40 years of my life, working like the devil... on my own. Toby shipped off, went his own way. Life is short, Lorraine. I lived mine here. Can't I go my own way? - Of course you may. - Could you please have a word with John about all of this? I hope the children will understand. - Poor Daphne won't. She's in for a terrible time. - You hear that? - Look! There they are. Nice going, Daphne! - Hang on! Great! Good for you! - Go! - She's super! - Oh, what's Elvar doing now? Look! - Aww, look at him! - Wow! Keep it up! Bravo! - Yay! Move it! Faster! - Come on, Elvar! - Come on, Daphne! Ha ha! Look at her! - Wow! - Don't let go! - Ah! - Well? - Fantastic! Isn't she great? - Hi. - Hi. This is Anne. She's a biologist. - How do you do? - A-ha! You're Daphne's rescuer. - Well, news travels faster on land than it does through water. - Hello! - Hello, Tadpole. Well? - Well, what? - Did you make some good recordings? - Nope, not a sound! I sat there on the water for two hours. Nothing! They didn't come out with so much as a peep today. - Oh. Hey! You're teasing, aren't you? You got something? - A lot. The cassette's in my bag. - Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! - He won't bite. Dolphins never bite anyone. - I hope not, with chompers like that! Oh! Did you see that? One sniff and he snatched it. - But he didn't sniff it. He saw it. Dolphins can't smell anything. Elvar! - They also have limited vision and navigate by echolocation. - Woo! Ha ha ha! - Which means that they emit these little clicks, up to 1200 per second, like bzz, which are reflected back as an echo. - Oh, like bats do on land. - Right! The clicks help them tell where they are, how far away things are, even the form and density of solid objects. When you're in the water with a dolphin, he can see through you, as if you'd been x-rayed! All of your organs, even bones, he sees them. - Hey, look! - Oh, bravo! - Then if I got in the water now too, Elvar could tell I'm pregnant? - Are you pregnant? - Uh-huh. - Oh. Well, sure he would. Elvar would know right away. It's the first time a bottlenose dolphin has been spotted this far north. This summer is the 7th we've seen Elvar. He's become a genuine phenomenon for us. We've had specialists come here from all over to verify his presence, but no one can explain why he keeps making the journey. - Well, the reason is Daphne. - But the most intriguing thing is the cove is Elvar's domain. Once he's moved in, he won't move out all summer. Sometimes Daphne's tried to lure him out to sea, but he just won't hear of it. - Lorraine told me. It's got me puzzled. Why sell when business is good? This year, we've had more tourists than-- - Than ever. It's my chance to sell, when I can see you're provided for. You'll all be able to stay in your old positions. - I'm glad we'll be protected. I'm not interested, though. What would I do on a golf course? Or in a casino? - : Daphne, look! - Hi, Grandpa! - I dread having to tell Daphne about it. Poor old Elvar. If they build that marina in the cove, one thing's for sure... we won't see him anymore. - Thank you and welcome from our whales. As you may have heard, humpbacks love music. This evening, they've asked you all to a free concert. Since our stage was so small, I've recorded them for you. - It's a poem. A poem no human being could write. Sheer loveliness. I wonder if he can hear it. - I hope he can. - I can't bring myself to believe it... ...that soon, we might leave. - I just happened to see her. I don't know how long I watched her. It was almost like looking at a statue. She stood like this, concentrating. But when I spoke to her, she said she had to capture the sun's energy when it rises. Strange, huh? - Some girl, huh? - I believe she's more than that. - You'll see. Just wait. - OK. I'm ready. - Hear that? - No. Is she there? - Yes. Like last time, Anne. What I don't get is how come you don't hear it? - No, not a sound. - How can I hear something if you don't? She's snoring now. Ugh! Your naptime's finished! You've gotta get up! You're sleeping on the job! Told you she was there! - Right! - Ugh! She's as stubborn as Elvar. You should've heard yesterday's lesson! I couldn't catch on. I had to play that note the whole morning! - Didn't much like the note you played her? - No. She just didn't like where I played it. - Oh, I see. - She's stubborn. Listen. Did you hear? She's much better. - Yeah, but you'll catch up, Tadpole. You have a great music teacher there. - The greatest! And the biggest. Her name is B Minor. - Well, we have another fine turnout for our tour program, and this morning, two choices are possible. Namely, a boat tour for the seafarers among you. You'll accompany me on Old Manor's cruise ship on a tour out to sea. And we'll probably spot a whale or two today, with any luck. - Are we gonna see the whales that make all that funny music? - Oh, we'll try to come up with oodles of whales that make that music! Now, for those whose feathered hats are wind resistant... ...you might want to go on a bus tour with our guide, Bernard... ...to a peninsula near here that is the nesting ground of a colony of puffins. - There's another path over there that leads to the inn, and over there we started on a playground. - Are you going out on the boat today? - You'll make a sailor out of me yet, hmm? - Well, I won't give up easily! - Daphne... Can I talk to you for a second? - Sorry Grandpa. If I'm not there in one minute, Alexander will have an infraction! - Infarction! - Anyhow, he'll have a fit. Bye! - Hi, Daph. - Hi. - Hey, you've got to listen to this. - Well? Not bad for the ending, eh? - Got something that sounds more punchy? - Yeah, but you might get mad if I played it. - Why? - I taped you singing with that Madonna record! I'm pretty sure I hid it in here. Well, well! Here it is! Yup, this is it! Ow! Take it! Oh! A roar of thunder! An air raid warning. - Is our speech recorded? - What do you think? Walt Disney... - Hello! That's Michael and Julie. They're super nice! - : Well anyway, come here. Oh... this one is perfect! Great, huh? - We're all set. - Poor kid. She doesn't suspect a thing. - No. Her Mom says they'll break it to her soon. - Someone better break it to Elvar. - Michael! - If he tells her, maybe she won't feel so bad. And it concerns him too. - A madman! I'm married to a madman. - Meet you on the pier. - OK. Hey! You meet me in good time, huh? I wanna see some of those famous whales up close! - OK! OK! Yoo-hoo! Where is he? Elvar! Elvar! Come here, boy. Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo! Oh, hi! How are you? Wait, where did you go? Oh, good. Now, listen. I've gotta talk to you. The inn, Old Manor, it's up for sale. OK? Up for sale. You know? Hey! Hey, no! Come back! Elvar! Oh, this is important! Listen, boy. Old Manor, it's up for sale. Wait. I love you too, but... no, wait! Don't! Oh, he's playing. Don't play! It's important! Get back here. You've gotta tell Daphne. All right, I can see you! Oh! Oh, good. Now... now, listen to me. Listen to me. OK? Come on! Old Manor is... Ugh! Son of a... Hey, you! Elvar! Old Manor is about to be sold. You have to find a way to tell Daphne so she won't be too upset. You've gotta tell her really gently. Huh? Gently! - Oh, boy! I can't wait to see Bernard's face. - Nobody gets mad like Bernard! He'll turn bright red, jump up and down. I bet his pants will fall off! Come on, we have to get there before they do. - OK. - Ah! WAIT! NO! WAIT! COME BACK! WAIT FOR ME! I blew it. - Hello! - : Hello! - The boat left you behind? - : Yeah! - My father's got a lot of nerve. Hey! Want to go with us? - Go where? - Where Bernard's tour is going. - On a picnic? - Nope, just to have fun. Coming? - : What are you two giggling about? - : What do you have in the bag? Oh, we're here. - Cut the motor, Daph. - Hang on. There. - Ouch! Honestly! Now be careful, huh? - Don't worry. I'm not a complete doofus. - You OK? - Yes! Will you let me get off? AH! Oh, yeah. Big joke. - We liked it. - I'm not hurt, in case you care. I might have been! - Oh, come on! We're just as wet as you are. - Michael, you go on up there 'til you see Bernard and join him. But please, you've gotta keep as low as possible. - See you. Isn't this exciting? - Have time to film a good joke for your show? - Hey, kids. Buzz off. Go on. - Yeah? Well, too bad for you! - Who's he bossing around? - Oh, we'll get him before he goes. - Over there. - Look at that one! Oh! - Every summer, the humpbacks leave the warm southern waters and move back north to our colder waters. We estimate their long migration takes about a month. - Oh, they surfaced! Look! - Not bad! - They head for regions where food is most abundant. In fact, their main purpose in coming here is to eat and build up their reserves, because they may go four months without food when they return south. Sailors call them Hounds of the Sea. - Hey, look at him! Lord, he's huge! Look! - Over at the starboard, which is to the right, by the way, and notice the white markings on his tail. There! - Oh, I saw it! - The pattern of those markings varies from one humpback to another. No two are alike. They're a little like fingerprints in humans. And they allow us to identify every humpback with precision. - From here on, we must stay low. As close to the ground as possible, all right? And don't make a sound. The slightest noise will startle the whole colony, so stay low and just peek over the crest. And madam, would you remove that flowered hat, please? That could scare them too. - : There they are! They stopped. - Three... two... one... And go! - They're trying to see where it's coming from! - : Ladies and gentlemen! Today, we're talking with Mrs. Polly Finfeather! Hello, Mrs. Finfeather! - : Hello! - Mrs. Finfeather, what do you think of all these tourists? - That pair of rascals! - Come on, more! Some days I like them, some days I hate them! Especially when they come and bother us right at mealtime We don't go stare at them when they're eating! And I don't like them when they scare our babies either! That really upsets me! Don't they know they could bring on a nervous breakdown? Or even an infraction! Oh, that's a booboo! Grandpa told me it's not an infraction! - It's good enough. - What's more, they'll tramp around anywhere! Some of them even step on our eggs! Tell them to watch where they're going, Bernard! And you watch where you put your big feet too! - Ho ho! - Ha ha ha ha ha! - Oh, blast! - That's super! - You can't touch me! My arm's broken! - Just you wait, you little pest! You're gonna pay for this! You've made fun of me for the last time! Come back here! Daphne! Daphne! You can't get away this time! Come back here! - Oh, blast! - Hey, wait! - You know, if you don't stop, I... oh! - Daphne! Daphne? Where are you? Where are you, Daphne? Come on! Oh! Daphne! Daphne, what are you doing? No, Daphne! Come back here! You can't get away again! Wait! WAIT! Hey, no fair! Daphne! - Hey, stop! Get off that! Hey! Hey! - No! No, come back! - Wait, get back here! Wait! Some of our stuff's in there! - Then come and get it! - Blast! - Bye-bye! See you at home! - Before you work yourself to death, I brought you a little lunch. - Oh, thanks. That's nice. Have you noticed by now -- oh, I suppose you must have -- that Daphne can hear a lot more than the rest of us? - Oh, yes. No question. I first caught on when she was only four. Our dog Suzie, you knew her? - Mm-hmm. - Well, they played together all the time then, and that's when I noticed Daphne and Suzie'd suddenly freeze at the same moment. Now, I hadn't heard a thing, but in time, I learned to look up to see the car, 'cause every time they'd do that, one would appear, which they heard long before me. - You know, this summer, it's two years that I've worked with Elvar, but Daphne's also been fascinating. Would you let me give a special hearing test to Daphne? - No problem. - It would help to verify something. It's extraordinary. If she can make out the sounds she says she can-- - You know biology, but you don't know children. Show me an 11-year-old that has a poor imagination. Take what Daphne tells you with a grain of salt, Anne. - Hello, Grandpa! Good thing I got it before it drifted right out to sea. Must've got loose while your TV crew lay around getting a tan. Ah, these landlubbers, huh? You don't believe me? - No! Not a single word. - You're pretty hard to fool. - There. - Grandpa, Anne was telling me that a long time ago, the very first dolphins and whales lived on land. - She's right, Daphne, but that's a long, long time ago. - Maybe years from now, we'll be living underwater. In kindergarten, I used to say I'd marry Elvar someday. - Oh, I remember! You even asked Father McKenzie if he could swim. Tadpole, that reminds me of a story. A few years ago, I was chartered for an expedition off Bermuda by a renowned professor. Now every morning, around about 10 or so, we saw a school of dolphins heading for the other side of the island. This intrigued us. We set out one day to follow them. We moved towards them slowly... and we saw something so curious, it was unbelievable! There were 11 dolphins standing on their tails in a circle. Can you imagine? In a circle! Looked like they were holding a meeting. Then, when they heard us, they turned and looked straight at us, but... they didn't move away. It was incredible! Never saw anything like it in all my days. Of course, nobody ever believed us though. I did this, but I've always been sorry I didn't have a camera. - But they hold lots of meetings like this, Grandpa. - And how do you know that, Tadpole? - Elvar. He's been telling me their secrets. - What secrets? - I'll tell you when you're young enough to understand, Grandpa Toby. - Gee, all that equipment you have must weigh a ton at least, huh? Yeah. Guess this is sort of a nuisance, huh? That Daphne's a riot, isn't she? Hey, give her a break! Imagine if your dinghy had come undone by itself. You'd have lost it! This way you know it's safe, at least. OK, boys. Push off. That's the way. - Grandpa, what's a nomad? - A nomad is someone who's always moving around. Never stays in one place. - Like you, huh? - Like me... or Ulysses. - Ulysses? Who's he? - The greatest sailor of them all. He lived long ago. He's just a legend nowadays. - Did he live when whales could walk? - Not quite. - Did he have neat adventures? - Mm-hmm. The neatest adventures you could imagine. You know, in those days, sailors believed in the sirens. They were mermaids with bewitching voices. They sang so beautifully that the sailors who heard them lost their minds, and the ships crashed on the rocks and sank without a trace. Ulysses, he was smart. When he neared their island, he ordered all his men to plug their ears with wax so they didn't hear them singing. Then he had his men tie him down to the mast of his ship, and that was how Ulysses was able to hear the siren's song without being lured to his death. - Those sirens were pretty good singers, then. - Or maybe they were humpbacks, Tadpole. - It's Alexander. - Hmm? You're right. Uh-oh. Looks to me like you're gonna have visitors. - Those guys? - Mm-hmm. - Uh-oh. - Here, grab the rope! OK. We're coming aboard. - Well, good afternoon. - What's good about it?! Where is she? - Where is who, son? - Come on, Captain. That pest, Daphne! - Ah. - She took our Zodiac at New Island, and now it's back here! It couldn't come back by itself. - I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about. Maybe if you'd stop squinting like that and look me... - I'm not squinting! ...in the eye, we can hold this conversation man to man. What do you think? - Now, listen! Did we or did we not take a Zodiac to do some filming on New Island? - You did. - Well, a little girl that you know-- - Wait. Before you go any fur-- - Just tell me how our Zodiac got here! - Ah! You want to know how your Zodiac got here. - Yes! It didn't just drift back here! I mean, someone must've-- - You know, it's funny you should say that. Some Zodiacs are equipped-- - There she is! Hey, you! - Hey! Hold it! Hey! - Come back here! - Come here! - Have a nice day! - Come back here, Daphne! - - : Be good, now! - You're not gonna get away with this! - Bye! Bye! - We'll miss you! - See you later! - Been nice knowing you! - Suppose he could pull me? - That's up to him, I guess. Yes, Elvar. Very good. Go to Michael. - Hello! Hello, Elvar. - Go, Elvar! Go! - Oh, whoa! - What's your nails! He has sensitive skin! You mustn't scratch him! It'll get infected! - Whoa! Whoa! Go faster! Whee! - Woohoo! - - : Hang on! - OK, OK! - : Hold on with both hands! - : Watch out! - Try it, Julie! Get him! - Go on! - Ah! - Hang on! - Hold on tight! Hold on! - Look at him go! He swims fast! - : Nice going, Elvar! - Hurray! Bravo! - - : Elvar! - What'd he say? - I love you. - So "eee"... ...means I love you? - That's right. - I love you too. - - : Aww! - Kiss him! - : He wants lots of kisses! Aww! - Good. Now, concentrate. I'll transmit the signals. Remember, wave your hand when you can't hear them. - OK. - OK? Here it goes. - It disappeared. - I just knew it. - Didn't I do well? - Daphne, my dear, you are able to perceive signals up to a frequency of 40 kilohertz. - Does that mean she's sick? - No. - How many am I able to hear? - Oh, we humans normally can't perceive much above 16 kilohertz. - Well, Daph never has been normal. - And dolphins? - 150. - Cats? - About 50. - So dolphins are the champs! - Sorry. Bats are able to hear over 170 kilohertz. - Who cares? Nobody likes bats. - No more tests. I'm finished with you for now. - Is it my turn? - Go on! You wouldn't get past 3 kilohertz. - What? - There. See what I mean? - Bye. - See you. - Bye. So Daphne can hear things the rest of us can't begin to. - Certain frequencies, right. - Incredible. - I always thought she had a gift or a special talent, but... I never knew how special. At times, I think I'm dealing with a... phenomenal sense of hearing. - Hmm. A lovable phenomenon. - Can I have some cherry pie? - No. - Daphne... - Oh, there's Grandpa! - Daphne, you must not disturb him now. OK? - I'll just go tell him hello. - Daphne! Daphne, stop! I said stop and I meant it, Daphne! You hear?! Later, after lunch, we'll see if they're gone. - But if I'm quick, nobody's gonna mind. Who are they? What have they come for? Who are those men? - I don't know. - What's going on?! Why are they here? - They're making some kind of deal. - What kind of deal? What do they want? - Look, Daphne-- - What do they want?! - They're buying Old Manor. - They're buying it? The inn? The boat? The grounds? And the cove too, then. - Sorry. - But it's home... for Elvar! Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa, no! Wait! Grandpa! Grandpa! You can't, Grandpa! You can't! - Come on, baby. Don't cry. - He can't do it. Tell Grandpa. Please, tell him! - Come along, dear. We'll talk to him tonight. - Elvar! Elvar! Elvar! Oh! Hello. You like fish? You love fish, right? Well, I've got a whole pile of them for you. Look! Come back, Elvar! Elvar! Elvar! Elvar, what's the matter with you? You have to eat! Elvar? Come back! Elvar! Get sick if you like. - Yes, in the village. - Is it far from here? - Oh no, it's just down the road. - Is there a post office in the village as well? - Excuse me a minute. - Oh, sure. - Alexander? Well? - She's playing with Elvar. - You mean it? She's OK? - Oh, she couldn't be better! - Are you sure? - Mm-hmm. - OK. Good boy. - Things are bad. - It's hard for Daphne, huh? - Yeah. But Elvar's even stopped eating. - I'll have to talk to them. - Mm-hmm. - Daphne went off... to be alone. If you like, I'll take you to her. You might do Daphne some good. - Coming too? - You go alone. I'll wait for you at the village. - Do you feel any better? - It's nice and quiet here, huh? Whenever things go wrong, I come here. Everything will work out, you know. - Are you sure of that? - Grandpa Hector won't back down. I've got a plan that will stop the sale. - Could Toby have a talk with Hector? He's his brother. - They haven't talked since I can remember! They do not get along. I'm going to organize a parade in protest. I'll have the tourists and the folks in the village. Will you help me? - OK. I'd be delighted to. - Whee! Over the sea we'll go sailing today Can't you just feel That salty spray? As if the ocean came pouring down Come on, sing! Sing along with me This song About the deep blue sea La da di, la da di What's the matter? - Shh! - Hey! Hey! HEY! Hey... Daphne! DAPHNE! HEY! - A humpback's gotten tangled up in a fisherman's net! - Know where? - Five or six miles that way! Just off shore! - Come on! So, now what? - I gotta tell Grandpa Toby! - How come? - 'Cause it could panic and start to struggle! - What?! - It's tangled up in a net and if it tries to get free, it becomes tangled up more! It'll wreck the whole thing! Two years ago, some fishermen nearly killed one! - But why? - It was destroying their net! A whale's tangled up in a net offshore down the coast around New Island! - Hurry up and radio the coastguard! - You're not gonna fall for another one of her stupid pranks? - If you knew her like I do, you'd button your lip, mister! Have I made that clear? If you were smart, you'd stop meddling and tell your crew to load their camera! - Load the camera! Quick! - There's frogs all over the place. Sometimes, you can hear them all night long. - Oh, really? - Julie! - Where's Daphne? - She's gone with the captain! The one I met the other day. They've gone to rescue a humpback that caught himself in a net! - No! - Just off New Island! - Over there! - You wanna go? - I just knew it. It's B Minor, my professor of music. - Hold it. Can't approach her yet. She's too panicky. - I'll try to calm her down. - Down you go! - Hurray! - They did it! That was great! - Great work! - Bravo! - Bravo! - Way to go! - You can be proud of your Tadpole today, John! - Ah! - Oh! - Well, tell me what happened! - We did it! We saved B Minor! - Ah! - Trust me to leave with an empty tank. I'm sorry, my love. - Come on, it's not your fault. - Well, I'm no fisherman, huh? So much for my family tree. If you want my shirt? - No thanks, Michael. Here. Put these in, Michael. Let's row to keep warm. - Where to? - Anywhere else. - Hey, look at this. I found the compass. Let's see. Compass, compass. Can you work it? - It points north. - Yeah, but from where? Oh, we'll never make it. - We have to. Try that way. - Oh, I hear you saved it! - It was B Minor! - B Minor, your professor of music! - As soon as I recognized her, I played her our song, and she calmed down and they cut her free. - Oh, Tadpole! Good for you! You're wonderful! - DAPHNE! Daphne! Daphne, I looked all over for you! - I was on the boat with Grandpa Toby. - We've got trouble. Those people are talking to Grandpa Hector. - Oh, no. Already? - Yeah, and I heard Mom say they're signing the contract. - You mean today?! - Yeah! - Well, by thunder! We'll fix this, Tadpole! Come on! - You'll have to borrow Dad's pickup if we wanna get there in time! - Hey! - The keys are in the ashtray! - Hey, wait! - Dad, we'll be right back! It's an emergency! - Huh?! - Toby, none of this concerns you at all! - Good thing Tadpole tells me what you're up to! - It's too late. Our deal is set. - You can't dispose of Old Manor without consulting me. - That's not written down anywhere! - Perhaps, but as father lay dying, that's the agreement both of us promised to honour! The inn cannot be sold unless both of us approve! - Your uncalled for intervention is especially unwelcome because it's pointless as well. These contracts have been carefully examined by all concerned, and they're perfectly in order. Now, all that's required is your brother's signature and the deal will be final. - You didn't want anything to do with Old Manor, Toby! - Because you always were more capable than me! - That's just the point! I'm no longer capable, Toby. I want out. - We've gotta get reinforcements. You've gotta get Mom. We'll go look for Michael and Julie. - Yeah, but they're not back. - Are you sure? - Yeah, they're in your boat. They went to meet you. - The gas! - Don't you see, Hector? You'll ruin everything! If you do sell, that poor child will never be the same again! - We have to leave fast! Grandpa Hector, give me one hour. You know I'll come back. Just give me one hour! Dad, we won't be long! There's another emergency! - Uh-oh. - What's this foolishness all about, Alex?! - I don't know, Dad. - Daphne's friends ran out of gas. She leant them her boat and now-- - Hey, hey. Come on. Rest. No point. - We'll never get back, Michael. - Hey, don't you start now. OK? Tonight at Old Manor, we'll be laughing about this whole thing. - Wait for me, Daphne! DAPHNE! - Let's go. It's a pain Drifting at sea, you know I'll go insane It ain't no fun To lose your brain Help Somebody help us This is the end We're in a mess We can't even send An SOS We're in a bad way Oh, I hate the salty spray Won't somebody save Julie and me It ain't no fun No more to be Lost on the sea - Michael! - Whoa! Whoa! Come on! Come on, Tadpole! - Oh, am I happy to see you! Oh! I was getting scared. - Um, Michael, may I ask you a favour? - Anything! - Please, quit singing! - Oh. Where were we? - Two or three miles out. You drifted. Go straight! But not too fast! - I'm going up front. - OK. - Hey! The village! - Where's Tadpole? - HEY! WHERE IS SHE?! - What? - THE ZODIAC! LOOK BEHIND YOU! - DAPHNE?! - COME BACK! - OVER HERE! - COME BACK! BRING THE BOAT IN! - What? - MICHAEL! - Look! - I don't know! - Get to shore, come on! - NO! DAPHNE! I didn't see a thing! I don't know what happened! - Where is she?! - I don't know! She must have fallen! - It's OK, Michael. I've got her. - Let me come too! - All right! Come on! - It's going to be all right. You've seen Daphne every morning. She's the child of the sun. The child of the sea. She was born in water. She's in her element. Alexander! Matthew! Come with me, quick! - Where'd she go overboard? - Sorry, but I don't know where. - ELVAR! ELVAR! - ELVAR! - ELVAR! - ELVAR, WHERE ARE YOU? - ELVAR! - ELVAR, COME HERE! - ELVAR! - ELVAR! - ELVAR! GO FIND DAPHNE! - Elvar... Daphne is in trouble out at sea. Go find her, Elvar. - Elvar, save Daphne! - Elvar! Go help her! She's out at sea, Elvar! Go out and find her! - Hurry! She needs your help! - Swim, Elvar! Swim! - Swim, boy! Swim! - You've got to save her! Find her, Elvar! Find her! - Swim, Elvar! - Slow down. Around here is where I last saw her. Right around here. Hey, look! Elvar! Elvar's looking for her! He disappeared. He's gone. - Oh, there! - Daphne! - Elvar! Over here! Here, Elvar! - Elvar! Come here, Elvar! Good boy! - Daphne, wake up! Daphne! Daphne! Oh! Oh, Daphne! Oh. Daphne. - Good boy, Elvar! Good boy. Well done! - Thank you, Elvar. She's all right. She's all right, Elvar! You did it! - Yahoo! - Good boy, Elvar! - Thanks, Elvar! - Good boy! You led her back to us! - Daphne! Oh, my precious Daphne! I was so frightened, baby. - Mommy. - Are you all right, Tadpole? - Mommy... Come here, Anne. - Uh-huh? - The whole world ought to hear about Elvar. - I promise they will. Trust me, sweetheart, the whole world's gonna know about Elvar. - Did you give her the hour she wanted? - I haven't signed anything if that's what you're asking me. - Perfect, because I have a proposition to make. - There is a place I grew up in Where I'd like to be Each day - 'cause I've seen The treasures that it holds And I've learned the lessons That it's taught Ooh ooh Ooh ooh - All the wonders That lie within Close your eyes And hear the dolphins sing All around the world In harmony We are one There's no distance Too far to reach Share the travels Of the whales beneath Come along And you will finally see - We are one - There's a place I know And it carries me Away If you listen You will hear it call You'll come running Just to see it all With me All the wonders that lie within Close your eyes And hear the dolphins sing All around the world In harmony We are one There's no distance Too far to reach Share the travels Of the whales we meet Come along And you will finally see - We are one - There's a place I know And it carries me Away Far beneath There is a world to see I have shared the secrets That it keeps Within There's a place I go Where I like to be Each day 'cause I've seen the treasures That it holds And I've learned The lessons that it's taught - To me
