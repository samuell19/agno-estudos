WHAT CAN A KISS This is the Tomahawk and West Railway , built in the Colorado Rockies , where it said, it is impossible to put a track and make a train go. But the experts were wrong. This is the first train, to ride on iron and to be pulled ... Locomotive Number One, Emma Sweeny, a 10-wheel vehicle, narrow gauge, and with a bizarre weight of 33 tons. Locomotive Number One, was built in Philadelphia, by Baldwin Locomotive Works. With the most modern design. is equipped, with the newly invented, air brakes. The driver's headlight is in oil and has a range of 7.5 m. BLOODY BASIN CANNONBALL RAIL It is very fast and reaches speeds of 56 km / h. It would be safe to say, that on this day of September, 1875, it is the latest technology. ¶ In 1843 was when I met, sweet Biddy McGee ¶ The girl looked elegant. When working on the railroad. ¶ ¶ In 1847, sweet Biddy McGee, went to heaven ¶ ¶ Instead of a son, he had eleven. ¶ ¶ When I worked on the railroad. ¶ - Does it bother you? -No, it doesn't bother me. So why are you so nervous? I don't want to ruin your trip, Mr. Jameson. As well? There are a lot of people who want to end this railroad ... It seems to me, we're going too fast. What are you saying? A railroad helps everyone. Who would want to end it? The Diligence Company, whose business will suffer. There was another railroad, narrow gauge, the Silverton short line. It was also going to put the Diligence Company at risk . The departure of your first train, until you cross the bridge, from Devil's Canyon ... -So? -There was no bridge. If anything were to happen, it would have already happened. Like? This train never rode before! - Is this your first trip? -Yes. - Am I the first passenger? -Yes it is. The first and only passenger. We're going too fast. Play! -We failed! -But they are held for a while. -We shot them like ducks ... -Don't be silly. Dawson said, it should look like an accident. God help me, I hope we haven't damaged the wheels. Are you all right, Mr. Sweeny? -Things here happen quickly. -Not so fast! -Who is this? - It's the passenger. Mr. Jameson, Terrence Sweeny, the driver. Sweeny, nice to meet you. I introduce Tatum Eyes Sad, the man with the smoke. The fireman, that's how it is! I was saying ... I was saying, Mr. Sweeny, that there are people, who doesn't like his coffee maker. Don't call a coffee maker. the Sweeny girl! It is the most beautiful locomotive on this side of the Mountain. -Yes, while it lasts. -What do you mean by that? Such a rock does not fall alone. More stones should have fallen. Mr. Jameson, it's not like that. Come in and relax. I'll go to Epitaph, see if I can find men, to get this stone out of the line. It's ok. But I always thought the rules said that the captain would never abandon the ship, nor the driver the locomotive. It is true. But it doesn't seem to me that we need help. Miss Sweeny, you can push this yourself. In case I don't succeed, I'll go ahead. I tell the sheriff to send help. Walking is good for me. We meet at the Overland stagecoach station . Trancas, tell the Colonel what happened. Okay, Dakota. Friends! Hands up! No offense, friends! No offense! Say what you want, boy. He was on his way to Epitaph and the train had an accident. I thought you could give me a ride. -Are you a traveling salesman? -Yes. The best in the West. -Okay, boy, go up and shut up. -Thanks. But I shouldn’t aim a shotgun like that, to a guy like me. -You may come to regret it. -Not when I'm at an advantage. But there is no advantage! It's not that I like pistols a lot ... But a man has to go with one, even if he doesn't like it. Hold this one, please. Thanks. And you are. I can only go up if I let my foot in the stirrup. Thanks. Who is that? It is Colonel Dawson, who owns the Company due diligence. Shut up! Thank you very much, friends. How are you? How are you, friend? I'm Johnny Jameson, they call me Jameson. Can I help you with anything? Raise your hands or punch it in the middle. -Is it the Dodge Kit? -Dodge kit? Who? I? -No, I'm Chuckity Jones. -Where is he? Mr. Dodge, he 's busy at the office, is trying to tie a knot. If it were you, I wouldn't let Mr. Dodge pick you up here. He can pass a bullet through a button hole ... and let them be amazed without touching your shirt. We are waiting. Grandpa, don't push me. Stop it. I'll tie this tie, no matter what. Grandpa, sit down and be quiet? - It's too tight. -No, it's not. I said it’s too tight. For God's sake, let her tighten your tie. The last message says, that the train has already passed Ten Mile Tower. It must be here. It's coming! It will be ready now, even if it's the last thing, that I do. -Raise! Let me see. -Not. Please... Neither you nor my granddaughter managed to fix my tie. sheriff, listen. There are many things at stake on this small railroad. I am not talking about the advantages it will bring to me, but to the nation. What will happen to Colorado, when the line is ready, it will be the opening to the West, Kit! It means enriching the nation with wealth from the mountains in the distance. There are a lot of people against this railroad. Dawson and his band of Overland, think only of them, not of the nation. This must be done and must be done well! Well, to put it this way, Mr. Bishop, let's go ahead. Grandpa, watch out! Here, Kit. - We are grateful, Miss Kit. - Not to me, Mr. Brink. The feat was Grandpa's! What do we do with this, Miss Kit? Arrest him! We give him what he deserves this afternoon and tomorrow morning we hang him. -So, Chuckity? - They call him Johnny Duque in the Manga. What is he doing in Epitaph? He told me that he sold subscriptions to the "Saturday Evening Post". It is true. Magazines and cups to keep your mustache from getting dirty. From Colorado to Utah. These are my samples. -Were you armed? -I searched it and found nothing. Here you are, friend. A wide variety of cups. Buy one! Or the "Saturday Evening Post". You don't usually have it around here, do you? -What is this? -Ah! It is not for sale. Not? -Have you ever been to a hanging party? -Not. For tomorrow go to one ... yours! Wait a minute. You can't do that to an innocent man. He was with the bandits. Why do you think I have a cock on my head? I'm not a chicken! - Ask him. He saw. -That's true, Miss Kit. How did you fall for such an old trick? What would he come here for, if not to kill Grandpa? To tell you, that the Number One locomotive, of Tomahawk and West, it was stopped 8 km from here, due to a stone on the trail. That's why I came here. This makes you the biggest liar in the state of Colorado. It was stopped ... Well, Sweeny must have pushed it. Listen, Madam, I'm not a criminal. Just confirm when they arrive. They will tell you that I was the passenger. It would be a reasonable excuse, if I feel like being reasonable, but I don't feel like it. I'll give you a chance to disappear from the city. If you are within city limits at sunset, will become a permanent resident. Who do you think you are? We are in a free country. I'm a citizen. I have the right to come and go when I feel like it. And I will stay! Sir ... just left! God forbid, son, he almost cut his hair. Next time, cut off his beard! -She can't do this to me. -Yes you can. That girl is not just any girl. There are already three solitary graves in Boot Hili on her behalf. Mr. Bishop! Mr. Bishop! Are you there! Your locomotive is coming! -You can already see the smoke down there. -Get back there, son. I'll go now. So, Doctor? -It is so so. -So-so? - Disappear, doctor! - As you wish, Mr. Dodge! I would n't trust you with a dead mule. - As you wish, Mr. Dodge. - Get out of here! "So-so!" My God, Kit, what are you going to do? You are not in a position to travel. I tell you what we're going to do. Kit, honey, get here. Chuckity, take a badge out of the drawer. Raise your right hand. Swear solemnly. apply the laws of the United States and the State of Colorado? -I swear, grandpa. -Give me the badge. In the presence of these witnesses, I here name you one of the United States Sheriffs, from La Plata County, Colorado. -Oh, grandpa! I do not believe! -It's absolutely impossible. Because? She rides a horse, shoots and spits. better than any Pikes Peak agent and will fill the position. Leave everything to me, grandpa. Rest one day ... and ride through the mountains to Tomahawk. - I get there before you. -Combined, grandpa. Wait, granddaughter. I have to tell you something. It is private. I wait for you outside, Miss Kit. Kit, this is the first time you've traveled the road alone. Realize? I mean, I won't be there to save you. Realize? Well, sit here a minute. It's like bees and flowers, Kit. The flowers are full of honey and then the bees are all concentrated like ... When the girl reaches her age, it means that ... Well, I mean, it's not what it used to be ... before you are your age. Realize? I don't understand, grandpa. -Not? -Not. Girls are girls, you know ? And boys are boys, understand? And it's the law of Nature that ... That ... Well, that's how it works. What I'm trying to say is that I trust you, dear. You can trust, grandpa. That locomotive will arrive intact. It is not the locomotive that I want to arrive intact. -I don't understand, grandpa. - You better go, honey. -And behave well. -Of course, grandpa. Take care of yourself. Bye. Pawnee, did you get the message? Thank God! If a bird drags that girl's wing , you have my blessing, to split his head in half with his ax. - Alive, Dakota. - Alive, Clayton. Hello guys! - Alive, how are you? - Alive, Dakota. Colonel, I'm sorry what happened ... Congratulations, Dakota, for the mess you've made. Calm down, Colonel. We are not to blame, that the rock did not work ... - I told Trancas to tell you ... - Trancas died -and Gila will be hanged tomorrow. -What? Now listen and see if you understand at once. Let's do this way: Dakota, you join the group, which takes the locomotive to Tomahawk. They're going to need a hand, now that old Dodge isn't going. Bat, you and Charley and Fargo, follow their trail. They enter the camp and the Dakota covers them. -And then? -When everyone is asleep, put the dynamite under the locomotive and light it. Combined, Colonel. Black Wolf, go to the hills and meet the Indians. Alarm them! Tell them, what the Iron Horse is going to do. How it will chase off buffalo. If the Indians declare war, they kill us too. It is a risk that we have to take. -Look at those rods! -And on! What a track cleaner! Go, get out of here! And take the big hands off Sweeny ... or they will feel the weight of my hand. Go away, disappear from here! Sweeny? - My name is William Bishop. - Glad to see you, Mr. Bishop. You are also happy to see me ... Did you think we couldn't do it? They still haven't succeeded. Let's go to the station. Take care of Miss Sweeny, Sad Eyes. Okay, get away. Nobody moves! Sr. Bishop! I sent the news to Tomahawk, but I don't know if they arrived. I think the redskins cut the lines. Bad luck never comes alone! Why so sorry? How far is Tomahawk? 96 km and we have to get there before Saturday noon. 96 km? Miss Sweeny does that in a couple of hours! You'll see, it takes a little longer ... The mountains don't scare my girl at all. There are no rails! It was built to cross the Rocky Mountains. The wheels are quite heavy and when it passes ... - Are there no rails? - There's no way to Dead Horse Point. The tracks sent from England went astray in a storm, in the Strait of Magellan. We will never finish the line, but it remains at Dead Horse Point. -Where is Dead Horse Point? -A 64 km. 64 km? But, Mr. Bishop, I have 33 tons of locomotive out there! How do I get to Tomahawk without rails? Sr. Sweeny! Stop screaming, newbie, and put out the boiler fire. Come on, coachmen. We don't have all day! -Chuckity! -Yes, Miss Kit. Chuckity, take the mules up and keep them happy. Tie them to that thing up ahead. Let's move! We will! You heard, what did you say? Tie the mules there! Come on, boys, tie it back there. Bring them here! -Is it the lady who rules here? -It seems so. I'm going to Tomahawk and judged, that maybe he needed an extra pistol. -Who are you? -They call me Dakota. I'm a passing cowboy. Do you write down calves, which loop? A person gets better as they live ... Or dying. -Do you know how to use this thing? -Of course, Madam. I learned from Wild Bill Hickok. There is no better! - Than he or you? -Than me. Pawnee, find a can for this sniper! Attract them! You better protect your head! When he throws the can, shoot. -Ready? -There is a lot! Very well! Nice shot! What are you going to do in Tomahawk? To tell you the truth, I heard that they needed a new sheriff. He's a defender of the law! We need all possible help. Do you know how to guide a mule? I am also stubborn! Do you see those coachmen? Tell them to get attached to the locomotive. Yes ma'am! If you can do anything else, wave your little finger. He's even handsome. Isn't it, Pawnee? It says it all. -Kit! Kit! -Sim, Sr. Bishop. -We have problems. Lots! -What's it? Mr. Latimore, discovered something horrible. "The license will be granted if the company in question, "has a train running, between Epitaph and Tomahawk, noon September 5, 1875 and that at least one passenger, buy a ticket, travel safely between the cities mentioned above. " We must have a passenger! Listen, Kit, please see if you find an innocent, that you want ... Mr. Bishop, now nobody wants to travel on the Tomahawk line. If we don't get a passenger, we lose everything. I don't promise anything, but I'll try. Pawnee! Overland, there will be bandits everywhere. Nothing done! And I don't want the Indians to make me a new hairstyle. -Never! We decided on luck! -I don't, bro. A ticket, please. Do you want ... a ticket? -Yes. On the next train. -Give him the ticket, Homer! - Sir, there's only one train ... - Okay. -Which only goes to Tomahawk. -It doesn't matter. What time does it leave? -As soon as I buy the ticket. - It's two dollars, sir. -Are you sure you want to go? -Absolute. I'm a witness, friend. I don't want to be blamed. -Blamed for what? -Your blood. -Blood? -She doesn't have all the tracks! -Who told you? -Who told me what? Mr. Bishop, what are you going to do? Everything is tied up and ready, but we didn't find any ... The Lord? I told him to get out of town, until sunset. Wait a second, Kit. You can't talk to him like that. -I can not? -He's our passenger. He bought a ticket for Tomahawk. He? I refuse to protect a subject, who helped to put a bludger in my grandfather. For the last time, I had nothing, with the shots, against your grandfather Sou vendedor da "Saturday Evening Post". Calm down, Kit. Personal matters are not called here. Your duty is to take the train to Tomahawk and protect the passenger. -Do I have to take care of this guy? - As if it were your husband. Okay, but when I get to Tomahawk I'm a widow! Departure on Line One! -There is only one line! -That's what I said! Depart on line one of the train that opens the way to Tomahawk! All aboard! -Mr. Sweeny, it's me. I will go with you! -You can only be crazy! -What's wrong with him? -You better get on board, sir. We had a little problem ... - There are no carriages? -Not! Well, guys, grab there. That. Now the others are going there. Leave the chain slack. Exact. Make them back off. We will! We don't have all day! Minnie Pearl, so pick up ... - Are there no rails? -There are no rails! -Well, I think ... -This is your ticket! -There was a misunderstanding ... -Very well. Take him, boys. EPITAPH VOLUNTEER FIRE FIGHTERS BAND -What happened, Chuckity? -Minnie Pearl released the harness. We leave in a minute. -Who is the Chief, Sir? -Killer, the laundry has arrived. What is up? I need to go with you, because I have to take my laundry, to the city of Tomahawk. - He's two months late. -I don't understand your conversation. He says he wants to come with us because he has the laundry. -The laundry? -Yes. The suit for Tomahawk. -Have been waiting for 2 months. -Tell him that there are no more seats. -He can have mine. -He heard what I said! Listen, this guy wants to be a passenger and I don't. -The Lord bought a ticket. -But I sell. You'll need it up there. Aren't you going to clean up the city? Tell him not to! She said it is a pleasure to come with us. Thank you Girl. Thank you very much. He wouldn't take no. Listen there! Me and my troupe, we want to go to Tomahawk. -Can we go with you? -Good... There are no places for ladies, Madam. Nobody talked about ladies and the show must go on! -Are they actresses? -My dear, how innocent! This is not going to be a picnic. They will have to contribute and help. Helping will be no problem, dear. Okay, Madam. Come and respect the break. Girls! Girls! Annie! Ruby! Clear! Julie! -Yes, sweetie! -Yes, sweetie! Come on, girls, to the station. Let's go now. - Gentlemen, please. -Please, gentlemen. -Herman! -Tell me, lady. Dispatch you! Let's go! Bye! Bye! Let's go! EPITAPH COLORADO IS LEAVING The food is good, but the service leaves a lot to be desired. Your shoulder, please. I used it for a moment. If you promise not to run, I will release you. -I don't promise anything. -If he tries to escape, shoot! Wait a minute. You should protect me! -He protects you. -How do you like her? How do you like that? How can you be so brazen? I do not know how to answer. High up there, outsiders. Say what you have to say. We are traveling the Durango telegraph line. The Indians cut the cables. We would feel safer if we could camp here. Only the three? -Feel at home. -Thank you Madam. Prepare bread and beans for these gentlemen. O Madam, how about a show here for us? Come on, give a show. I lost what they got at Epitaph. -In this joint? -Come on, Madam! I haven't seen a woman's ankle in three years. And I haven't seen a woman in three years. Shut up, Fat man! We will not act here. They have played in worse places. Young, we work in the thinnest houses, Denver, Dodge, Deadwood and Durango. E aquela noite. em "Lost Mule Flats"? Was there? Okay, friends, let's start the show! Only in one condition! You can't flirt with my girls. Velvet Finger, o pano! Ladies and gentlemen, the show will begin! -Ó ... -Joe ... -Jose ... -Go away! ¶ Some men are very shy when they are flirting ¶ ¶ When we chatter with them It's rare to get them to speak ¶ ¶ And others are so direct that we cannot deny ... ¶ ¶ You can chase a woman away! ¶ ¶ This is what happens to this boy named Joe ¶ ¶ When I meet him I want them to know ¶ ¶ Always trying to Steal a kiss! ¶ ¶ And then I have to tell you: ¶ Joe Joe, release me Leave me alone or I'll call Mom! ¶ ¶ Joe, let me go But how daring you left me! ¶ If grandpa caught me here, I bet he disinherited me. -Because? -I've never seen a show. -Isn't it beautiful? -It's not bad for one night.

Was good! Thanks. Those girls are beautiful, aren't they? Yes, they are. Grandpa says I'm ugly like a door. He's a fool. It is not ugly. I am beautiful... -like them? -You are more beautiful than them You're kidding me! Did no boy ever tell you he was beautiful? -Jim Bailey was saying ... -And why didn't he say? -Grandpa shot him. -Because? Said it was Jezebel's conversation and that if a girl listened to her , she would fall from grace. -Don't you know other men? -Only my grandfather. Is not it! Guys, who fell in love with you. Affectionate and friendly ... My grandfather is the nicest man there is. I remember when Buckskin Tony was sentenced to hang ... they didn’t do the tie well and when they released it, old Buckskin stood there kicking, hanging from the rope, with his tongue hanging out like a snake. And you know what? Poor grandpa couldn't stand to see him like this. Drew the pistol and blew his brains out so he wouldn't die strangled. Well, I'm going to see the camp. There is no rush. When everything is asleep, we blow this up. -Good night, Dakota. -Good night, Miss Kit. -Excuse me. -Want something? -What are you doing, Madam? -Trying to unite body and soul. What? You wouldn't let a gun rust, would you? No, but I'm not talking about ... A woman gets by when she doesn't have the right attributes. Realize? Well, I don't do any of that. How am I? It looks like a grave, well maintained. Wait a minute. Your hair, for example. -What does it do to you? -I comb it once a week. You can keep the moths away. But look, if I frizzed him a little bit, I would have curls. -You are very beautiful, you know? -That's what Johnny said. They are tracked with a pair of beautiful eyes 15 m ... This if you have good aim. -Aim? -Sure. It passes by a man. He looks at you. Then he takes aim and aims with both pipes. Blink your eyes like that. E "bang"! He's a dead pigeon! But don't shoot until he sees the whites of your eyes. Remember if! I thought you were already lying down. I can't, the stars are too bright. It's a beautiful night! The stars try to shine as brightly as your eyes, Miss Kit. My father buried the last man who told me that. -Worth it! -Good evening. Thank you, Chuckity. -Do you know how to play that thing? -Like a Spaniard. -Good night, Johnny. -Good night, Mr. Sweeny. Is there anything in the eye? Shouldn't I sleep with the girls? Not! -I have a light sleep. -Me too. What I say, is that if that pistol goes off, it destroys my dream. If you walk away from here, it will surely destroy you! You know, it doesn't look criminal. What made you become one? Why don't you believe? I'm not a criminal, I'm a traveling salesman. -Where did you learn Chinese? -In the San Francisco China-Town. -Speaks other languages? -I speak them all. I learned on my travels. I also speak German ... -Have you ever been to Germany? -Not. In Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It is the city where they make beer. Many Germans live there. On that trip I went to Minnesota to see the Mississippi River. What are you saying? Mississippi is not in Minnesota. Excuse me? Mississippi starts in Minnesota. It's only 30 cm wide, imagine. I passed over him. Two years later, further down, in New Orleans, it took me 2O minutes to cross it by bellboy. -What did you sell in New Orleans? -Cards. Yes, in New Orleans. From southern Louisiana to eastern Texas. -Cards? Just letters? -Just letters! Look at these letters. Go, take one. Feel the paper. It is of the best quality. No marked cards . Top stuff! Actually, there's the Duke of Swords. It is true. What a nice trick! It is not by chance that they call me Johnny Duque in Manga. Another one! Go, take out another one. Take one too. - Duke of swords? -Right! Duke of swords? Dukes! They're all dukes! Is that what you do? Walking around selling things? What's wrong? -Does it take you somewhere? -Take me everywhere. I'm the type who has to know what's going on across the hill Grandpa says there are people who don't see gold at their feet because of the mountain pyrite. Your grandfather instilled that. "Gold at your feet" should have children and a loving husband and not that tin star on your chest. But what is so good about you? It is a "loose foot", has no family. Where's your wife? I am different. I am married to the world. I walk from side to side, that's all. Where have you been? Grandpa took me to Durango when I was 8 years old. Durango? That is a hole, in the middle of the rocks. I was in New York and I saw ships with bowsprit tied to the street. We had to push them, so that the carriages could pass. I crossed the Black Hills region. I saw the beautiful waterfalls in Yellowstone. I traveled the Chisholm Trail in Texas, I watched the railroad junction. I visited Álamo, the birthplace of Texas, and I saw Mr. Lincoln being buried in Springfield, Illinois. Yes ma'am! From the mountains of Maine to the plains of Texas. I've been everywhere! I was born to travel. ¶ I want to travel all over ¶ ¶ and any borders ¶ ¶ With the sun always ... ¶ ¶ to chase-me ¶ ¶ I will follow my shadow ¶ ¶ E cantar "Yuppy-I-Yaddo"... ¶ ¶ On the way to Colorado! ¶ ¶ I want to play guitar ¶ ¶ No bar "Silver Dólar" ¶ ¶ and dating ¶ ¶ A beautiful girl ¶ ¶ I will follow my shadow ¶ ¶ E cantar "Yuppy-I-Yaddo"... ¶ ¶ On the way to Colorado! ¶ ¶ On the way to Colorado! ¶ Bat, it can go wrong, so it ’s best to get out of here now. Fargo, now it's up to you. Five stars! Kit girl! Bandits! There goes one! Pass the pistol over here and start talking! Drop it! I wanted to do the same to him. Didn't he offer resistance and kill him in cold blood? The man wanted to deceive her. He was going to do the bad guy's trick. -Trickster trick? -Yes ma'am. -He was going to hand over the gun. -Look! I didn't know this one. I thought all the sheriffs knew him. It's one thing that all the bad guys know. I don't understand the uproar! He tried to kill her and I killed him. Only that! Couldn't I have hit him in the arm? So I could talk. Are you implying that I killed him so he wouldn't speak? Dakota, I think, that you shouldn't fight me. Why not? Because I am the passenger of the locomotive and if you don't reach Tomahawk safe and sound, there is no line for anyone. So don't piss me off, otherwise you will still get hurt. Enough! I don't want any personal feuds at this camp. We still have a long way to go , so stop arguing! You're right, Madam. I regret losing control. -I bet so. - Shut up! Chuckity, bury this man and get some sleep. - We have a tough trip tomorrow. - Roger that, Miss Kit. Sad eyes, it is better to have a look here in the front. I think the track cleaner is almost "walking". You, Minnie Pearl. Here it is. I had too much rubber. Sorry for the excess of gum, it doesn't happen again. Excuses and more excuses! -Good morning, Mr. Sweeny. Good morning, Johnny. -Girl Kit, where are we? - Arriving at Massacre Creek. After the bridge, Dead Horse Point is 8 km away. Did you hear, Emma? Another 8 km and you can release steam again! We better hurry up, Madam, if you want Tomahawk arrived at noon on Saturday. Pawnee and I are going ahead to make way. Can I go with you? There's one more horse over there. -Not! -Wait a minute. I am the passenger. Shouldn't you protect me? -I demand to be in your custody. -It's ok. Can you ride? I'll try. Dakota! We go ahead. Go behind to save the locomotive. Keep an eye out. We are in Indian lands. I take care of this piece of iron as if it were Miss Kit. Thank you, Dakota. I'll be back. - "Thank you, Dakota. I'll be right back." -Shut up! If Dakota's soft talk, it was a bullet, the girl would already be dead. Do not say that. You should be ashamed! Let yourself be seduced by a cowboy! Nobody seduced me. It seems that it is not only the form, but how you use the weapon that interests you! I already told you to keep quiet! -Okay, Madam. -And you too! This trail is in good condition. When the locomotive arrives here, it will always be rolling. But it doesn't roll for very long. The track ends on the other side. Dawson said to hit the locomotive. - Look over there. What is that? -What a great channel! It makes a man feel like a little jump from heaven. It's too close for me. Let's get off this bridge. -What's it? -Listen! -I do not listen anything. -That's the problem. -You can't even hear a bird, nothing! -What do you think, Pawnee? Did you hear what he said? The Indians are close by. Can be. We wait for the locomotive on land. I did not know that I could interpret the signs of the Indians. -Where did you learn? -No Wahoo Jim's Wild West. Peanuts, popcorn and balm. From Utah to Wyoming. Have you been to the circus? I never went. An Indian named Crooked Knife taught me the signs. He was an artist. It was good at the number of knife throws. He left the entertainment business when his old man died. Now he is chief of all Indians. Crooked Knife ... Do you know Crooked Knife? Do I know him? We were friends He is the savage, who has caused the war ... and caused all the problems. He's not wild. And a very dignified Aboriginal and very good person You can't blame him for the war. I would do the same if I were an Indian! I wish, Dakota here. He was no longer here. What a beautiful landscape! A boy, he could bring his girl over here, give you little glasses. -Small ... what? - Glasses. Has it never been hidden? I don't think so. It should have been? A girl just starts to live for real, after being osculated. Well ... I guess, I don't understand what is oscular ... Do not know? And to kiss. -Do you know what kissing is? -I've heard. -You mean you were never kissed? -You can bet not! How are you going to get a boyfriend, get married, to settle down to start a family, if you've never been kissed? Grandpa says I'll get married when the time is right. If you continue to think so, you will become a spinster. -Is it already osculated? -Yes ma'am. From Maine to California, they gave me lots of kisses! - We better get back. -Wait a second. Tell me about it ... of oscular. Sorry, Miss Kit, I really like my life. -Your grandfather wouldn't like it ... -He's not here. -But your friend is. -I'll take care of him. -It's hard to explain. Realize? -Not. -For example, the Eskimo ... -Who? The Eskimo. A kind of Indian from the North Pole. The Eskimo kisses with the nose. When an Eskimo falls in love with an Eskimo, kiss her like that. -What a ridiculous thing! -Not for an Eskimo. -And if they are constipated? -Well, then there are the French. In France they are very romantic. They kiss elegantly. Like this... Oh my dear. I love you. I love you. -What does that mean? -I love you, my dear. I love her. What a beautiful conversation! Continues! There are several types of kisses. The mother's is like this ... Uncle Joe's that we haven't seen for seven years is like this ... Then that of the friend of the friend, it 's like this ... Yes, but I want to know how it is that a boy from Colorado, kiss a girl when they like each other. -Ah! ... It is not easy. -Show me. You can't fake a real kiss, Miss Kit. True kissing is only possible when love is true. It's very personal. You have to be madly in love with her ... and she has to think, that he is the best thing, since bottled beer. Then he gives you a hug like that, loving and tight, because she is the thing you wanted most, throughout your life, you know? -The Law of Nature. -Exactly. He then kisses her little nose, to provoke her, then one of the beautiful eyes, to provoke her ... -And then ... -Yes? -Then kiss your lips. -Oh yeah! Why don't you shut up? -We have company! War! -Let's get out of here! -Give me my pistol. -Give me the shotgun! Take the carts over there. Distribute them in a circle. Come on, in a circle! Quickly! Bring them here! Dakota! You and the cowboys shoot from there. It's to get it right! Chuckity, you cover the east part. Hit them! And you, the inexperienced, put out the fire when ... if any! Here they come! Come here, O monkey. Be quiet I already give you music! Only here is this part of the pack and it is already difficult. If the rest of the pack comes, this is the end of us. Let's hold on until nightfall. Indians do not fight in the dark. You barbarians! What do you do to Sweeny? -Fire! Fire! Fire! -So, erase it! If you can't erase it, see if my shirts are saved! Fire! Fire! Fire! Do not shoot between the carts. It still kills one of ours. Okay, Madam! Crooked Knife, it's me, Johnny! No, no! It's me! -Is your friend? - From the old days! They gave up! They have already withdrawn! We won! We won! What a beautiful outcome of an act! I don't think so, Madam. What you mean? Didn't we beat them? - It was just part of the pack. -He's right. They will return at dawn with many more of their race. We will camp in that gorge ahead. Tonight it’s good to have your back against a wall. Especially us, the inexperienced! Hold here! How lucky! If the cart had burned ... The firework would have exploded. What is he saying? Who feared that the firework would take everything in a Fire ... What firework? Fireworks for Tomahawk, for the Chinese New Year. Yes, but that was in February. I... be ... very late. Kit girl! Let me do the dressing. -Thanks. -You're welcome. I'm sorry to be hurt. It could have been worse. Pawnee managed to get one of the Indians to speak. So, Pawnee? A great camp ... North ... -20The Indians! -Yes, I realised. Pawnee, ask him, if he takes us to his camp, if we release him. -Are you crazy? -I have an idea. Do you know what the Indians are going to do to you? They will tie it with a leather strap and put a rattlesnake close to your face. Then wet the leather strap and it will stretch ... stretch ... I never considered myself brave. I leave the heroism to others. It's a matter of survival. If you do nothing, we all die. -Nothing done! -Girl Kit! We startle them , but they will return at dawn, 20O times stronger. Maybe you don't mind dying, suddenly, but I want to visit many places. I want to live! -Let's go to war! -And then? There is no bridge anymore. -How do you cross Massacre Creek? -We decide when we get there. -If you let me go, I'll try to ... -Giving up, isn't it? -I promise not to run away. -I do not believe in you. So, your problem! You never believed me! But it is best to believe or else all these people die. He's right, Miss Kit. I'm listening. After all, he's a city guy! You must have brilliant ideas. Not as bright as yours, Dakota. There he is messing with me. It's not nice at all! - I'm still listening. -It's ok. Crooked Knife is my friend. If I see him, I might convince him. The plan is as follows: Was it high enough? I want to speak to the Crooked Knife. Johnny! Johnny Duke in the Manga! It took a while to recognize me, Chief! My people, this pale guy, is my friend. It shouldn't be hurt. -Painted fresh! -What are you doing here, Johnny? -The last time I saw you was on ... -Laramie, wasn't it? Let's check it out, Chief. Is it from Custer? -How's Wahoo Jim? -I haven't seen him in months. He returned to the East with the show "Will West". It was a good show! We perform at the Laramie Theater. Remember, when I was a guinea pig in your number, of throwing knives? You had a mustache. The knife slid and sliced ​​at him. Never let it grow that big again. Good old times! Boss, do you remember our scream when we were in trouble? "Hey Robe!" I'm screaming "Hey Robe" now. Johnny, it was always good for me. Like a brother. We are friends. My people, do not attack your "iron horse". Is not it. I need help taking you to Tomahawk. We're at war with the pale guys! Do you remember this trick? Dukes. They're all dukes! With an addicted deck, you can't win. Well, this is an addictive war, you will not be able to win. Johnny, I know you're right. But my people will not consent. -If I convince them, will you help us? -You will waste your time. "Music, teacher!" -There they are! -You can already hear yourself screaming. Very well! You can prepare this thing! Guys, this man is very wise, has great wisdom and powers. He wants us to help him, loading his iron horse at dawn. We saved him because he is your friend. But if he is a man with powers, let him give us a signal. That's why I'm here. Want a signal? I tell you what I'm going to do. Inside my coat, I have something that will show you a sign, of something never seen before, west of the Allegheny Mountains. Please step aside so that others can see. I would like you to examine this stick. It is a stick, as you see and a string. I have nothing up my sleeve, nor a fake mustache. I take the stick, light it ... Get away, please. Thanks. Thief! -What did he say? -Thief. Well, if you don't get it at first, keep trying, try ... Now, friends, let's make a little ... How are you? Pale face! Sorry, I didn't see you were there. Get away, men. Let the artist pass. Very well. Stay there. I want you to see everything. To see is to believe. Isn't it, Chief? I hope! The sign! Light this thing up. Quickly! HAPPY NEW YEAR There is no business like entertainment! -Listen ... It's Johnny. -Came back! - Did it work? -In perfection! - They loved it, didn't they? -Good job, Johnny. Crooked Knife will bring as many Indians as possible. -The whole tribe, if need be. -Do not say! And what are they going to do? Swim across the Massacre Creek? We will not go through the Massacre Creek. Let's go for Funeral Peak. Do you think that these poor mules and the red skins succeed, to load 33 tons of locomotive to that peak? Those mules and the red skins carry that thing up the mountain even if we have to disassemble it until the last nut and bolt, -and each one takes a piece. -What? What did you say? You heard what I said. And that is what we are going to do! Yes? If anyone touches this Goddess, will take many potatoes in the face. If anyone dares to mistreat her, go down the ditch! -What did he say? -I said no! Ah yes? I've dealt with cattle before. The best is to let me take this from here and obey me, ready! What did she say? He said that if he doesn't let the locomotive be dismantled , he'll blow his brains out. She knows how to win an argument ... Do not know? Dismount there that I dismount here. Emma, ​​look at what they did to you. I had no choice! It's almost like seeing a woman without a corset. Don't worry, Emma, ​​we 're back on the other side of the mountain. - It's humiliating, isn't it? -I do not know how to answer. I'm freezing, Kit girl. Are we there yet? Dead Horse Point is in the background. -What time is it? -28 ° C. -What? -Half past eight. Only 32 km to Tomahawk. I'm making way, Miss Kit! I don't want any more problems. We would have less problems, if it was someone else, someone you trusted. There he is! Always provoking. -A man put up with each one! - Shut up! I still find it a mistake to let that guy go ahead. -After all, who's in charge here? -Me, Dakota. Go and make way. And you put yourself in such a way that I can see you. Understood, Madam. -Colonel? -What is up? Trouble! Come here, quickly! They are crossing the barrier with the locomotive and everything! It can not be! -The Indians are helping. -Colonel Dawson! -Bad news! -What's it? The whites brought in a magician, brother of the Croked Knife. You are lying, you half-breed! You're stealing, aren't you? -No, I'm telling the truth. -I teach you to deceive me! Clayton, let's go to the open ground! Go to Tomahawk and get the men together. Bring them with weapons. I'll meet you at the top of the Phantom Curve hill . If it is war they want, it is war they will have. -Now, ready! -Right, Colonel. DEAD HORSE POINT POPULATION: O - ELEVATION: 1850 M Willie, take these horses! There are bandits! They must work for the Diligence Company. I caught them spreading lead against the deposit 5 minutes ago. I still went after them, but they ran away. -How many were there? -Maybe twenty. Do you know their names? They should have left a trail ... Just see, it's yours, Dakota. They used Winchester weapons, Madam, they came from there. I don't care where the shots come from. I just know that Miss Sweeny won't go anywhere without water. I don't think she takes it anymore, Mr. Sweeny. -But what? -Water. I certified it before we left Epitaph. What? I told you to make the locomotive as light as possible. What are you saying? If he hadn't certified it, it would have rusted. What bothers me is that we don't have wood to make a fire. Firewood? Sorry, but what is that? Very well, pull from there. That's right. With strength! That! It's done. Very well. Now, load this wood. We cannot make a fire without that wood. I'm almost finishing. And you? In a minute. Johnny, go to the machine, see if the pressure is enough, can it be? Tootsy, rub hard! -I'm trying, honey. -Harder. You too. The important thing is that it shine! Here is a washed shirt. It still has a lot of gum. I'm sorry, I will take it and it will be as you wish. Sr. Sweeny! Thank God, it works! Girls, get down from there now. Okay, guys. Slim, take the mules again, to Epitaph. We don't need them anymore. Crooked Knife, protect the carts, even Tomahawk. Hurry up! We are also leaving with the locomotive. We have 40 minutes to do 32 km, 16 are to go up the gorge. - Do you understand? We will! -Girl Kit, I found this cartridge empty, under the deposit. -I thought you wanted to see -Sure. Excuse me, Miss Kit. This did not come from a Winchester, but from a revolver. It is true, Madam. And a revolver is short-range. We should find tracks on the ground. The only track is Dakota. Sim...Dakota... Pawnee... what did you say about dakota when we met him? This is very bad! He was very smart ... Dakota! -Where did you say you were, sheriff? -In Deadwood. Deadwood? I was there last month, selling cigars and fly paper. From North Dakota to South. - Did you know Wild Bill Hickok? -Sure. Is my friend. -Your Friend? - You heard me right. -When did you last see him? - 2 weeks ago, before coming to Colorado. - Was he okay? -Because? Because when I saw him, a month ago, he was not very well. He was lying in a coffin ... He had been murdered by the sniper named Jack McCall. You have 5 seconds to start the locomotive. But I can not... What do you think you are doing? Open the air before I break your face. They are running away from us ... Let her give it her all! Speed ​​up! Thus, she will not be able to make those curves up front. Worry about it, when we get there. Johnny! -Johnny, how are you? - It's all yours, Mr. Sweeny. -Kit, is everything okay? -Johnny, he hit me. Why did you get on the locomotive? -I was very worried. - I thought he would kill you. Shoot from the sides. Try to hit the passenger. If you can't, shoot the boiler. Those, too, must go to Tomahawk. -Speeds up! -We are moving away from them. Miss Sweeny, what are you doing to me? Come on, Emma. Terrence is asking. Talk to me, Emma! Mr. Sweeny, the pressure! You're losing pressure! Armed men, come on! They're out of bullets, guys. Shoot! -Colonel, look! It's the old Dodge! -Let's get out of here! Hurry, grandpa! Tie it up with ropes and start pulling! My God! Here comes the city of Tomahawk by weight! Chuckity is in the cart. We will! Grab it there! Force! Pull it out! -How much time left? -We have 2 minutes. -Grandpa, we only have 2 minutes! - We're trying, honey. They have just over a minute. His watch is bad! We won't make it. We do not have time! The city starts at that sign. But we can't move from here. Sir, are you the President of this metropolis? Exact. And these are the stewards. Mr. President, will you deny the concession of this line, because of 40O m? -I can't do anything. -How can you do nothing? Conditions have been issued, according to the laws of the Colorado Territory and the territorial law defines that: the line must be operational, six years after the Tomahawk and West line license date , and those six years end at noon, with exactly 45 seconds to go. Don't shoot me in the face! Now listen, Mr. President, don't just think about the gold and silver of these mountains, but in the money you can bring to this land ... Think ... commerce, schools for children. You can civilize the border! I am proud to be the first passenger on this train. Here is my ticket! I want my grandchildren to know it. -The territorial law defines that ... -Forget the territorial law. Colorado is no longer a territory, it is a state! the 38th State since last month. Don't you want Tomahawk to grow up? What do you say? The future of the West is in your hands. - Young man, go and get the plaque! -Good! Chucklty, dig a hole over there, could it be? For God's sake, hurry up, time is running out. I propose that the city limits of Tomahawk be extended even, the last wagon of this locomotive. I vote in favor! -Are you all in favor? -Yes! Proposal accepted! -Johnny! -Let's go! -Good, boy! -We will! Take it over there, Johnny! - Get out, Johnny! I, President of Tomahawk, declare that the Tomahawk and Western line got the license at noon today September 5th ... from 1876. - I'm proud, Kit. - Thank you, grandpa. Here's the badge. You have the right to use it permanently. Not! Stay with him. I will leave myself with weapons. What? You can't do that. No Dodge abdicates the star, except after it is dead. I know, grandpa. But I am not a "he", I am a "she". -It's different, you know? -How did you find out? With the man, whom I am going to marry. Johnny, I want you to meet my grandfather. -You mean coward! -It's nothing, he's a traveler. A traveler? A traveling salesman? You rascal ... Get away, Kit. Leave him! Get away, I told you! Get rid of him! -I hate to put you in your place, grandpa. -Well, if you like him ... Give me my star and receive my blessing. -No, no, Mr. Dodge. -Johnny! Your grandfather is right. I'm not a man for you. As I said, I am a "foot on the loose", with no family. But Johnny, I love him ... I love him. I love her too and I don't want to see her sad for anything in this world, but I always walk around . A house is for sleeping at one time or another. Maybe he wouldn't be so "on the loose" if he was lame the rest of his life. Kit, dear, it's not worth fighting destiny. I'm warning you. If you try to leave, start putting the number below. So go ahead, Kit, because when we get back, I'm going east. Train to Durango, Alamosa, towards East. The "Bloody Basin Cannonball" departs from Line One within 30 seconds. -You there ... -Tell me, sir. If you want to say goodbye to Kit, she's on that side. -Thanks. -Mr. Sweeny, have you seen Johnny? Kit... I'm going to leave. -Johnny, I will miss you. -Me too. Behaves well. It takes care of you and other things. Johnny, won't you give me a kiss? They make a very funny couple, don't you think? I do not know how to answer. -Take care of yourself, dear. -Do not worry, dear. A man who is born to travel, knows how to deal with the world! -Johnny, you forgot your hat! -It is true! -Don't be late for dinner. -This line arrives at the right time! All aboard! Friends, take a letter Take a letter. Any. Dukes! They're all dukes! -Johnny, your cane! -Thanks! Goodbye, Kit! Goodbye honey. Girls, wave to your dad! Goodbye, Daddy! Goodbye, Daddy! Goodbye, Connie, Barbara, Marian, Marylin and Joyce! Bye! Translation and Subtitling TERESA PRETA | RTP - Production Courtesy | Jair Paim Adaptation to PtBr: elizeuflu Synchrony: tetrao
