So glad to finally meet you! Sorry, I was held up with magazine interviews, Mother. I'm not your mother-in-law yet. My apologies for looking this way, I came from a hike. Please, don't be so formal. - Bring us some tea. - Forget that. Is that Royal Salute? May I? I need some hard liquor in me today. So, I understand you deflowered my daughter? Mom, don't be so crude. Once driven, even a Mercedes is a used car. Let me get a good look at you. No, your full figure. At least you're not deformed. Are you very wealthy? So, do you own this building? Not until my father's passing. - What about the art? - It's on a consignment basis. I don't want to brag, but my collection is too valuable for public display. - May I take a look? - Look at… Your collection. Of course. You stay here, let me borrow him for a bit. Gum? Gum? Right. Sorry, honey. She's a bit weird, huh? She's very avant-garde. Mother, this way, please. Sure, lead the way. - We'll be back. - See you soon! Showtime. Shoot. Good shot, Zampano. That was my shot. When will Zampano's turn be? Pull me up. Look at that dimwit. AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY MAIN POWER - LIGHT It's like an expensive fridge. The system recovers within three minutes of any problem. And please don't be so formal. - Weren't you a painter before? - Did my daughter tell you? Yes, that you were all about the romantic life. Shall we? I shouldn't look. - I'm set, lower me. - Here goes. Too fast! My pelvis… Honestly, everything in the museum is fake. Please, come in. Do you think I'm shallow for asking about your wealth? I thought you were frank. I am shallow. But can I tell you something? My daughter hit the jackpot. Ow, my head. Mother? Mother? - Mother, are you okay? - I'm fine. You seem comfortable with me now. Maybe a little. This way. - That was spectacular. - My pleasure. The clock's ticking. We've got three minutes. - Are you in? - Yeah, I'm in. Where is that decoder? That's it! - Okay. Zampano, get me out. - Okay. See you soon. Hey, I need more time! Chewingum, stall him! Mother, are you okay? Sweetheart? What's wrong? You okay? Are you hurt? Help me up. Life is tough at times. Hold on to him, he's quite a catch. One moment. Where's the alarm coming from? - It's from your private storage. - But I was just there. Madam! Madam! I'm sorry, but I'll need to open your bag. Something wrong? Honey, are you accusing my mom? Mr. Lee, if you open this bag, you'll never see my daughter again. What should I do? Open it. It's not here. Tell them it was just a security protocol. Honey… but there's no protocol for love. May we leave? She's the real deal. This beauty belongs in the national museum. Why is the payout so little? I can't put this on the market now. It's already on the watchlist. I'll give you the rest in two to three years. So… make up your mind. No choice. Split it. We have to take the money in front of us. I'll cover the rest from my share. Forget it. I'll collect it three years later. Can I get all of my share now? - Is money all you think about? - He said he'll cover. I worked on that dumbass for five months. Only cash will make up for my bygone youth. Did you sleep with the curator? No, but that's none of your business. That's quite a feat. Did you hold hands for five months? Chewingum! Am I a sex object? Watch who you're talking to. Where's your respect? That temperament of yours comes from not getting laid. Isn't that ancient history? How about him? Stop arguing. The next job is a blockbuster. Didn't Popie mention the Macao Park job? Who's Macao Park? Is that the backstabber you mentioned? Man, he used to fly high on the wire. Yeah, Popie's old boss. Like hell! He was just a partner. So, who is he? What a load of shit. When he was 24, he went to Macao with $700. How much did he make? $8 million! So, he's called "Macao Park." I don't care how much others made, unless it's mine. - Aren't we doing it? - Let's do it with Macao Park. I don't trust that asshole. The Chinese will join, too. Where the hell are they getting their leads? Turn on the music! - Just hide! - Get the money! - Hey, Popie. Business going well? - Good afternoon! Business is good to those who have it. You're not fired yet? - Ever heard of Leesung Gallery? - Sure. We've been following the curator for three months. He's been buying up anything worth a damn in China. From that Chinese fence, what's his name? - Wei Hong, sir. - Yeah, him. - Why so many Duponts? - Take one. Thanks. Anyway, he was robbed yesterday. But claims he wasn't. Security firms had a field day. Ashtray? Can I use this? Sure, that's… an ashtray. If it were you, how would you get in? I'd use a wire to get in from the next building. Show him the photos. That's exactly how they got in. Isn't that Chewingum next to the hottie? That's Chewingum? I haven't seen her in ages. Yeah? Give her a call with his cell phone. Let's see… Turn off your cell phone! I left it there… Yup, it's right here. If this was my job, I wouldn't use her. She's not good with orders, and drinks too much. She must be antsy, getting caught on CCTV like that. But why the hell am I getting pinned here? Once a con, always a con, is that it? She's not picking up. Want another blow? You're quite photogenic on the bike. This is me? I get accused of all the crimes? Show me a warrant if you want to open that! All I want is the curator, not you. Or shall I tail you for three months? You want a taste of the law? - Isn't the law a bit slow? - We'll make it fast for you. I'll get you a warrant tomorrow. God damn it. - Come out! - My cell phone! I forgot to take this. Spitting on a national treasure. We're going abroad. Why would we go there? Five-O has Popie now. Are we flying out? Should we go mess him up? Don't ask me. I'm antsy and drink like a whore. I'll pack a bottle for the trip! Have a good trip. I shouldn't go. I had a dream about dying abroad. Even Audrey Hepburn died. You'll die someday, too. We're in this together. I'll buy your bad dream. Seriously? Deal. Here comes my dream. He didn't ask for Chewingum. Just the wire team. Really? But Yenicall's going, right? Yenicall! Fetch a guest from the prison with that car. You still call that a Mercedes? - Isn't Pepsee due out next year? - She's paroled. Who the hell is Pepsee? - Aren't we leaving? - Do you know me? How would I? You brought my car. Why are you called Pepsee? Guess my temper stings so nasty like Pepsee. How many did you steal? It'd be easier to count sand on a beach. You must be so rich, no? Us thieves are poor because we steal expensive stuff and sell it cheap. It's all a battle against yourself. Was that a snicker? Well… There are so many things to battle, why fight yourself? - You don't like me, do you? - No, I really like you. - You must not like me. - I like you just fine. Right? I get on well with old women. Pull over. Excuse me, we don't have a lot of time. Don't talk to me about time. Yes, ma'am. Welcome back! - You know Chewinggum? - Of course, I do. The excellent and legendary actress. How do you do? Don't flatter me. I'm too old now to act with no booze. I heard you were in Japan. Popie kept nagging me for jobs. Smells like booze. My daughter's getting a divorce, so I had a drink! I drink a glass a day to maintain my health. This is Zampano. Excuse us for a moment. She's still beautiful. Bullshit. She looks like super-duper bitch. Are they dating? You're a boss now? Going legit? Only after the Macao job. - Did that bastard invite me? - He thinks you're still in jail. If we go, promise me you'll let me skin him alive. We're on the same page. We have to ask you to leave. Why, did I win too much? You're on the blacklist. Is that right? Thank you. See you soon. There won't be a next time. You never know. Chen, it's Macao Park. Let's go fishing. Sure, where? See you there. I told you they would arrive within 5 minutes. Call and cancel the police report. I'm so sorry. I thought he called. Sorry, I pressed it by accident. Half of the calls are false alarms. Shaowen! Where's my coffee? Coffee? No, thank you. Can I use the washroom? You really do come in five minutes. We're very precise with time. False alarm at the jewelry store. Nothing to report. Thank you. Thank you again. Thank you. Let's head back. Did you call it in? They want us in Tai Ji. Take care. Goodbye. You scheming bitch! Where do you want it? Here? Or here? Just the cash. Stop fooling around. You're a cutie. So, a chick's joining us for the job? Can't let the Koreans open the safe. Is she hot? I hope she's young. Definitely hotter than you. Here she comes. You haven't changed one bit. You're almost a man now. - We get to work together. - Finally. You still look the same. Is your father still active? He retired after seeing what I can do. Is that him? The charity case? Andrew! Huh? What did you say? Why are you speaking Cantonese? Making fun of me? No. - Belittling me? - Of course not! When are the Koreans arriving? Tomorrow. - Aren't Koreans always full of lies? - They sure are. - And that Macao Park's Korean, too. - He sure is. Goddamn Koreans. - Didn't you work with him before? - Once upon a time. Is that mustache Macao Park? He's not here yet. Look, here they come. - Check out those dirty looks. - We gotta watch out. One man sows and another man reaps. Come on, smile. - Morons, dressed up in this heat. - Grinning like village idiots. That Korean chick's hot, though. Definitely plastic surgery. You think so? - Let's get a taste. - Hey, Andrew. I'll go easy. Gotta put them down at the get-go. Wow, hot girl! That is some hot body. And a good job on the face. What's this fathead saying? I don't normally trust Koreans, but seeing you, I want to open up my heart. Go away, asshole. Asshole. What "asshole"? - He called me an asshole! - Just sit down. You speak Chinese? He's Sino-Korean. What did he say? He asked if you got plastic surgery. Hey, fathead, you know how hard it is to be born this way? Calm down. Let's wait quietly. You wanna die? Son of a bitch… Grab my arm? Grab my arm? - A tough guy! - Andrew! Think I won't shoot? I'll kill you! Don't move! I'm sorry. I'm fine. Ow! Hot! Cold water! Are you okay? You're Korean? I'm Korean! Ow! Are you okay? Did you come with Popie? Are you Macao Park? You reek of booze. Hold this. - Wait. - You must be the wire walker. Careful, the skirt is short. Short skirt and long hair, necessities for a lady. Shall we? We're pleased to meet you, too. I'm sorry for being late. - Good to see you, Chen. - It's been a long time. Sit. Sit, everyone. Sit down. Sit down, sit. Looks like you broke the ice. Let's get acquainted later. You're all professionals at the top of your game. Professionals. You, too, Popie. I'm a petty thief next to you. Isn't that right, Chen? Let's get down to the business. Chen, guns? This is too big. Too heavy. Come on, now. Just these. Where are we robbing? Insane! Absolutely insane! We're robbing a casino? What are we after? Our target is "Tear of the Sun." A diamond. Tear of the Sun, current estimated value $30 million. Stolen during an exhibition in Tokyo. Presumed to be in Hong Kong. Who is she? Tiffany. She'll bring the diamond. Are you the wire puller? Don't be rude, and that's my lighter. I thought it was your boss'. You're all grown up. Got a team of your own. So, I brought two old friends. Been a while. Can I join you? Have you quit drinking? I don't touch that stuff. You look different. Can I have a word? Why not? - Why did you bring Pepsee? - To open the safe. We come as a package or no deal. You should be the one to open the safe. Your hand is still wet. We're not that close. Wait! I just busted my safe-cracking hand. You still can't act. Chewingum can stay. But send Pepsee back. And take that stupid mustache off. Son of a bitch. Sorry, please don't mind them. Where were we? Isn't that Madam Tiffany? It's gonna get hot. She's Wei Hong's mistress. So, we're robbing Wei Hong's stone? Why? Scared? - What? - Who's Wei Hong? Wei Hong is… No one knows his identity, what he looks like, or even his nationality. The butterfly tattoo on his hand. Yeah, if you see the butterfly tattoo… you're dead. Your mustache? I know him, that Chinese fence bastard. - He's notorious. - He sure is. He's into arms dealing now. Wait, how much will you sell it for? $20 million US. Holy shit! $20 million! - Who will you sell it to? - Who could it be? This is a list of Southeast Asian fences. Malaysia's Boonhyungtan, Singapore's Weechung… and Hong Kong's Wei Hong. Sell it back to Wei Hong? You don't even know him. But I do. I've met him before. You've met Wei Hong? Want to back out? All right, let's do it. Who's the source of this info? Good question. She came in a Rolls-Royce. That's easy, it's just a hotel suite. He wants me to stay. Will you leave? No, life is about sticking to your guns. Good. Let's toast. Hey, country mouse! Go get us some glasses! Ma'am, I've got a college diploma! - And I lived in Seoul! - Is that so? Pepsee, join us. Let's do a drink wave! FOUR YEARS AGO - SEOUL What are you doing by yourself? We're here. Lower it. Here it comes. Macao Park's up first. Okay, stop. Standby. Take responsibility. For what? For stealing a woman's heart. Is that a crime? Hurry up, the cops are patrolling. Lower me. Here it goes. - Wait, something's wrong. - The wire feels odd. Is something wrong? Are you okay? Did the wire snap? Macao Park fell! - Stay where you are, I'm coming! - I'm going! No, the alarm will go off! The cops are moving in. Get out now! Can you hear me? Get out! What happened? Did the police find him? No. So, he's not captured. But why isn't he calling? The gold is worth $3 million. Would you call? - It's only been three days. - It's already been three days. Yes? Just a second. Let her in. Busan's great. Come in. It has to be that room. On the 15th floor. Two rooms, please. I heard you got paroled. Am I disturbing your plan? Korea's nicer than here. Disorganized, so much to steal. What's with the attitude? I thought you'd apologize. I have nothing to apologize for. Then what about that gold? Thank you, both of you. I took off with the gold, is that it? I'm a thief, so what? - Thank you. - Thank you. At that time, I thought we had something. It's not like we're Romeo and Juliet. Of course not. So, you said I can't crack the safe? Open this in five, and you're in. Three seconds. That's cheating. I'm a thief, so what? See you in Macao. Did you get it? The list of Southeast Asian fences. Okay! The diamond is ours. Will the duplicate be ready? Of course. It's me. Did you look into Tear of the Sun? Yeah, that one. Bring me the wine that's over there. Yeah. Damn it. So, how long will it take to make a replica? Three days with zirconia, but money's the problem. I'll give you $20,000. Send it over to Macao. It's all set. Whew, I almost died abroad. I see you're not jerking off. - Hey! - Yeah? Most women would be flustered in this situation. But not me. Why? This always happens to me. You little bastard, relax your lips when kissing. Hoarding the good stuff for yourselves? No… Drink up. I'm out, ladies. Let's drink. Macao Park, you're fucked now. - Popie, is it ready? - Let's go get that gold. Okay, I'm almost done. - What happened? - Macao Park fell! Did the wire snap? The cops are going in! - And the gold? - It's all with Macao Park. Why'd that bastard have it? …after reviewing CCTV evidence, police released a photo of the suspect. Have you been drinking? How long has it been? A fortnight. I get it now. He's not coming back. Are you okay? You're on my side, aren't you? Give me a ride to the police station in the morning. Let's do this. Stop it. So hot! It stinks in here. - What a shitty rathole! - So disgusting! From here on, use these cell phones. They connect everyone at once. For the convenience of communication. BlackBerry. Read the dossiers. Your roles are explained in there. Take a good look, everyone. Wait. My wallet… It's missing! Working with you thieves makes me nervous. Julie, was it you? Of course it wasn't Julie. Can't trust any of you. Who was it? My Korean compatriots just snatched it. You! You touched me just now. Why? What was that for? Do you like me, or something? Andrew! Stop fooling around. Okay? - Buddy! Getting jittery already? - I'm just pumped up… to make money. We're a Japanese couple? - Is that a problem? - No, I'll get it done. Thank you very much. I lived in Osaka for three years. Tokyo for me. Is that so? First, secure seats at the table. The Japanese couple must pour money into the game. And in order to break even, Jonny will bet the same amount against them. Okay. Second, survey the premises. Check the floor layout and staff patrol routes. Andrew. Sir, this is a restricted area. This isn't the Beijing Duck? - No, that's downstairs. - Okay, thank you. - What's good today? - Everything. - Has your dad been discharged? - Yeah, he's out. Andrew, check the security room. You'll get in with Jonny later. Next. Tiffany will arrive in Macao with Wei Hong's diamond. The GM will be there to greet her. Popie, stay on her tail. So good to see you, madam. It's been so long. This way, please. Tiffany's here. Two bodyguards, two suitcases. On their way to the casino. Is she a good gambler? She hits hard on every hand. She's at the golf course in the afternoon and at the casino afterwards. No particular meets. One bodyguard is always with her, meaning the other is on the 30th floor. I need the master key to check out the floor. You'll get the key. We'll have to borrow it from the general manager. Yenicall, Zampano, you guys are a team tonight. Why take that off? I'm going to work. You just focus on the wallet. Ten minutes will be enough. You like me that much? Just wondering what perfume you wear. I don't use one. It's my body odor. That's what men go gaga over. New hairstyle? Here he comes. What are you drinking? This? - Bourbon and Coke. - Bourbon and Coke. First time seeing you. Chinese? Korean. Korean! "Hurry!" - "I'm fucked"? - Yeah, "I'm fucked." I'm fucked… Shall I buy you a drink? Two glasses of wine. Wait… I'll buy. Why? I got a good feeling about you. - Seriously? - Yeah, seriously. The casino clients stress me out. Shall we go someplace quiet for another drink? No, I like it here just fine. This place is not bad. - Do you like me, too? - I told you I like you. He was really into you. Wait. How do we bring in the gun? The gun? Third, bribery. Why is he sending me alone on this? Which old man is it? - "Will it snow in Macao?" - Crazy bastard! "Will it snow in Macao?" - "Will it snow..." - Money. I'll see you upstairs. That's it? - The meal's here. - Please wait. That's mine. Ow, hot! It's okay. I'm fine, really. So hot… It's three. We need six. - Six! - Six! - It's six! - Nice! I feel bad for her. She's really rich. Probably doesn't know Japanese. Just need to get through two layers. FOUR DAYS EARLIER HONG KONG POLICE STATION 95% of the safecrackers go through the back. It's easy, but requires heavy equipment and takes too long. They're stupid, and get caught the most. But the real pros go through the front. It's difficult but fast. Here's why. The front is harder because of this glass relocker. If the drill shatters it… a wire attached to it releases a weight and the safe locks up permanently. There is no second chance. - When are you meeting Chen? - Tonight. Give her the gun. - Forget it. - It's for your own safety. I may not crack the safe. Worry about that instead. Didn't you learn the skills from your father? I'm sorry. Sorry for what? He's a thief and I'm a cop. Yes, yes. You can't fail. We need Macao Park to lead us to Wei Hong. We've been on him for five years Sometimes, he almost feels like a friend, and yet we don't even have a mugshot. That bitch. The back is 12 cm? No way you're getting through. Have fun. - It's strong. - Still just a drink. Did you win $8 million in one night? Three days to win. One night to lose it all. You should've left when you won. You can't win with that kind of attitude. How did you feel, then? "I'm fucking nuts." Is Macao always this hot? Then take it off. Do you have to sell the stone to that Wei Hong? Otherwise, I'll be hunted down. I wish I was hunted down like that. - How would it feel? - It's hell. And lonely. What's that tattoo? I've been lucky so far, no exception. I got a huge piece of intel… Yeah? What's that? I'll tell you another time. This is my grand exit. What? I'm putting it on, not taking it off. What the hell are you doing? You like her? - No. - Then what's the problem? We should concentrate on the job. I have no savings whatsoever, even though I've been doing this all my life. All that money's gone to my daughter. Now, my son-in-law as well. And I get scared over even the tiniest job. I envy you. Young and beautiful. It's all makeup. I'm all rotten inside. At least it's just your inside. Whenever it rains, my body aches all over. After this job… I want to get married… No, just live together. And pay taxes like everyone else. So, what do you have to do? I have to open that safe. But the problem is, you have feelings for Macao Park, so, you can't open the safe. - I loathe that man. - Feelings like that. Then I should like him? That son of a bitch? He's an SOB, but one who'll make us rich. Something doesn't feel right. You gonna let Macao Park sell it alone? A long time ago, two thieves stole Tear of the Sun and went to Wei Hong to sell it. Know what happened? One died and the other barely walked away. - How much did he get? - $1,000. Ouch. I don't trust Macao Park. - This job is bound to fail. - Hold on. Macao Park is underestimating him. So, we only go for the cash. Tiffany's cash. Okay. COD CASINO 18 HOURS LEFT Chen and Chewingum check into the 20th floor suite. Yenicall will climb to Tiffany's suite from there. Your suite is ready, madam. - Let's take a break. - Let's go. - What time will you be back? - Around 5:00 a.m. She speaks Japanese? See you then. - Zampano, go to the roof. - Okay. - How do I avoid the CCTV? - Don't worry about that. Popie and I will create a diversion. You call that English? Sir, are you okay? You bastard! No fight. Shit! Drop the elevator cam and show me the floor feed. Problem at sector B72, please remove blacklist #39. Please confirm. I'll take care of him. I'm terribly sorry. We have a situation on the floor. Are you there? Yes. Stay hidden. That's my specialty. Bastard… So, he punches me for real? It's me. The package arrived. Make a left in front of the warehouse. There's a cafe by the Xavier Chapel. Get it from the female owner. I got it. Did you get the boat for us? - Why aren't you married? - Women don't like bad men. No, you seem like a good man. I, too, have seen Wei Hong's face. A long time ago, I stole Tear of the Sun in Tokyo and took it to Busan. If you don't comply before this burns out, you'll die one by one. We won't sell at that price. We want $500,000. I said nothing and the fire went out. So, I'm a very bad man. No, you're a good man. I'm sorry. I drank too much. I get nervous before a job. Tomorrow… whatever happens, don't leave my side. I haven't done this in over ten years. Let's do ten years' worth. He won't answer a thief's prayer. Two thieves were by his side when Jesus was crucified. We understand each other. Don't we? It's not the worst sin in the world. Just a flower trying to bloom in a pile of shit. You rushed out. What did you pray for? For us to never meet again after this. You're hiding something. - Why did you ditch me four years ago? - Did I? Zampano, how's the wind up there? Pretty good. It's all set up here. Be careful. What happened to us? Careful. We're on in 30 minutes. Everyone to your posts. Standing by. D-DAY - 4:35 AM Yenicall, are you ready? Hold on, I'm going in now. - Your earpiece? - I forgot. - Window work done? - Yeah. What the… What a love boat here. Lucky you. I'm here all by myself, so lonely and pitiful. Let's just focus on the money. I'm ready. Be careful, Yenicall. What about Tiffany? Already went to the casino an hour ago. Tiffany must not leave the VIP room. Chen, keep her there. Don't worry. Okay. Everyone, remember. We only have a ten-minute window. If the system goes out for ten, cops are dispatched. How come you're not coming in? I'm on the blacklist, I'll wait for you at exit 7. See you in ten. - Why is he stopping there? - Probably standing by. Yenicall, have a good climb. Do you trust me? I have no choice. Then do you love me? Can I tell you later? All right. Ready, action! Hey, wire one is too tight. Loosen it a bit. Okay, loosening wire one. Yenicall, be careful! Are you okay? God damn it! I'll kill… I've reached Tiffany's suite. - Let me help you. - Thank you very much. Freeze. You can't be here! - Jonny, we're on the 30th floor. - We're going in. Thirtieth-floor thermal got something. Don't shoot! Everyone, freeze! Cells phones and walkies on the table! - Who are you? - Where's the main power? Get over there. Security room under control. You're late today. What's going on? Everyone, stop! Hurry up. We're at the door. Watch your head. Welcome. Sir, the backup generator is up. This is the underground vault. The main power's out. What's happening up there? What's wrong with the main power? There must be a problem. No cell signal, either. Shall I check it out? Seal the door and follow the security protocol. The police will be here in ten minutes. But I have to leave. No one leaves. Let's turn up the heat. - Get me more chips. - Yes, ma'am. Here. Don't doze off on your morning watch. Relief in 15. Yenicall, are the safes open? Two minutes, 19, 18, 17… Are you guys on a date? Let's hurry up. Crazy bitch! That's it! Don't worry, I got a good feeling. Bad luck today. Chen! One move and you die! - Back off. Don't do anything stupid. - Move over there! Chen, what are you doing? - Petty thief. - Bad luck for you. Get the cash, quickly. EMERGENCY VIP ROOM - Sit! - But I'm so light. It's open! It's not in this one. Over there, then? Report from the VIP room. - The VIP room? - Please check. No answer. Let's check the VIP room. What is it? - What's that? - I don't know. Isn't this our wiretap? He knew about us! - What? - What the hell? Where is it? The main power is back up. Sir, look at this. - That's the VIP room. - Yes, sir. "Forget the diamond. I'll meet Wei Hong alone. It's been a pleasure." What does this mean? - Is he fucking with me? - "It's been a pleasure?" Chen, what does he mean? Did Macao Park know Wei Hong? Macao Park, who are you? - We have to leave. - What about the diamond? That woman we met in Hong Kong is working for Macao Park. Zampano, take me down first. - Chen? - This is a trap. Run! - Which way is that? - West casino floor. Two to the parking lot, two to the west floor. We got a message from Julie. Macao Park took the diamond. Secure the casino exits and pass along their photos to MPD. The police are here. - Good, unseal the doors. - Yes, sir. - Come with me, old man. - Sure. Okay, next one. Hey! Come over here. Aren't you assigned to the VIP room? Have you seen these people? Have you? - What's wrong? Give her some water. - Here you go. - Cross-reference the employee list. - Okay. What's your name? This could be her. "I am…" Crazy bitch! "Crazy bitch." What did she say? Your name is "Crazy bitch?" Do you work here? He looks suspicious. Shall we take him? Hey! Who is that guy? Bok Hee! I love you! That's the guy! Stop! All units, go to Zone A to chase the suspect! One suspect in custody on the casino floor. Let's split up. Be careful. Excuse me. Pardon me. Go on with your duty. Show me your ID. What's going on? Where are you coming from? Don't let me keep you. It's okay. They don't know our faces. Right. Let me go! You've got the wrong guy! I'm not the guy! - Let's verify at the station. - All right, fine! Shit, don't look at us… Don't look… Let go of my hand! You three! Stop right there! I said don't look! Don't move! Stop! Freeze! Hands in the air! Suspect opened fire in parking sector C! I don't see her photo. Are you scared? It'll be okay. Okay. Move! God damn it! Shit! Macao Park, I'll kill you! Give it to him! Freeze or we'll open fire! The suspect jacked a car. We'll cover the back! Stop the vehicle! Floor it, Chen! I'm okay! Chen, you're amazing. I love you. I really love you. Please say it one more time. I love you. You're wonderful. I'm sorry. No, I bought the wrong dream. Two suspects were killed while fleeing. Their vehicle crashed into a wall. Confirmed at scene of the crash. Presumed to be the VIP room suspects. Transferring three suspects, ETA ten minutes. POLICE Why am I so unlucky! - This doesn't make sense! - Just stay calm. - Is it a crime to be at the casino? - Shut up! Stop the car! Tell them to stop! Right now! - Stop, now! - Fine! Popie, grab the wheel! How could you leave me there? You knew Macao Park was gonna backstab me. I'm sorry. I panicked. I should've saved you first. Ladies first. What about everyone else? Chewingum? She promised me she'd play my mother at my wedding. Let's go to Hong Kong and get that bastard. Place men at Macao Ferry Terminal, Hong Kong Airport, and Central Terminal. Just tail him. Don't make an arrest. - Hey, I'm here. - Hi, Macao Park. We're in Tsim Sha Tsui on Macao Park's tail. Goddamn Hong Kong humidity. - I'm off. - Bye-bye. Wei Hong… the diamond is a real beauty. Me? Enough pleasantries. Let's get to business. $10 million. Not here in Hong Kong. Busan in three days. Come yourself. Hey, hey. Give me a light? Thank you. How do we find Macao Park? There's a saying, "Chase the wind and clutch at shadows." What did the woman Macao Park brought drive in with? Rolls-Royce. Let's search car rentals. It must've been a week ago. Six days ago, actually, by a Korean client. Korean? This must be it. - Your wife's loving it. - Only the best! I got a rush when I stole this. Hey, I found a watch over here. I'm unable to contact the client who owns this watch. I have it here. Hold on. I've just sent it to you via email. Andrew? Andrew! Hi, this is Mong Kok Pet Clinic. What can I do for you? A vet? Good afternoon. This is Busan Grand Hotel. Hello? This is Busan… Who is that? The cop who was tracking Tiffany. Could Macao Park be next? - Will Wei Hong go to Busan? - Definitely. - What's Macao Park thinking? - We'll find out. I have a detective friend in Korea. Cameron? Who the hell are you? Once a hopeful actress, now I con for a living. But I live and die by loyalty. Where is he? Yenicall, one prior conviction for adultery. Adultery? Not adultery, it was love. Shut that fucking trap of yours. Did I ask for my bio? Where is that bastard? I told you, I live and die by loyalty. What's your dog's name? Cameron. Cameron? No, please don't! - Cameron? - Please! Leave him alone. You really love him? Slash Cameron's throat. So, where is he? The mark is entering. Where has he been? He brought some hiking equipment. The mark is going upstairs. This will be a long day. - Where the hell is my coffee? - Sir, it's coming. It's that building, #1503. - Slow down! - Why? This place is littered with cops. - Cops? - Why the hell are they here? Me? Do it all by myself? Just turn the "run" switch off. What the hell is that? Looks like they're towing our car. Wait! What is it? Parking violation. We received a complaint. We also work for the government. BUSAN D.P.T STORE Okay, it's done. I'm coming out. Uh-oh. No mistakes. We're all listening in. Hey, you see the rage in my eyes? You make a mistake, Cameron goes to heaven. Shut your trap! Wait. If he doesn't deliver the diamond, Wei Hong will kill him. Even better. They'll be here in half an hour. No, I'll come to you. - We called the elevator company. - Just get that fixed! The mark is leaving. Julie! Macao Park is on the move. I'm watching him. Take over on this side, we'll follow him. Go slowly. How long will it take? We'll fix it in a jiffy. - Don't take all day! - I've been doing this for ten years. Definitely Macao Park's scent. Is he on a diet? What are you doing? He won't hide it in plain sight. Busan's great. It has to be that room. On the 15th floor. Two rooms, please. How many times has that car circled the street? About three times. Macao Park is going in. Missy, make sure to ask where the diamond is. - Ticket? - Here. - The ferry departs in two hours. - Thank you. It's all over, then? Stall him for five minutes. It's a shame this has to end. It's been fun. I always have fun with women. Really? Had fun with Pepsee, too? Why did you save her back in Macao? With that old man disguise on. She was that important? Don't trust women so easily. She betrayed you with Popie. Injured your leg. Right, my leg got busted from the fall. The alarm went off and I slipped into the sewer. And I just crawled… - For a fortnight? - Yeah. When I went home, it was dark. They didn't need me. Sure, they cut the wire together. No. She earnestly loathes me, even now. She asked why I took off with the gold four years ago. You still trust her. The wire was his job. He, who secretly loved her… and a small-time burglar without me. Is my story too sappy? A little. - When will you sell the diamond? - Soon. Where is it now? At your place? Popie! Did you cut it? Macao Park's wire? What are you talking about? Asshole. Give me a straight answer. Stop fucking around and find that diamond, bitch! Get it yourself if you can. Yet another love boat. Whoa, did you cry? Let's stop. Enough of this drama. - The diamond's in there? - It's an empty room. Remove your dirty hands. How do you know? Whose hands are dirtier? I saw the parcel you received in Macao. Open this door. You open it… if you can. Looks like everyone's here. Are you in my room? Why are you all so quiet? Found the diamond? No. Pepsee, you probably didn't try. All these years… Sorry for hating you. Thanks for saving me in Macao. - We should meet... - Meet and do what? Are you on a date, huh? All lovey-dovey? My upstanding character will give you five minutes to get out. Some scary men are coming. When did you become so merciful? Didn't you know? Mercy comes from the wallet. That wallet is ours. Yenicall, are you in yet? Why are you calling me out? Hey, Macao Park. I'm going into your room, #1505. Hear that? How are you going to sell that fake diamond? You're in a living hell. What do you think? Why are you so quiet? Huh? I don't know anyone in heaven, anyway. - Macao Park. - Where's Wei Hong? - The diamond? - The money? Go! They made contact. Arrest the woman in the café. Let's move. Hurry up! Everyone's heading there. Okay, I'm Macao Park. Let's absorb some nicotine first. Yenicall, are you in? Did you find the diamond? Please shut up. I need to focus. Sure. Wait. They're all carrying automatic weapons. Don't worry. SWAT's on the way. It's that car again. Move! Careful, old man. - You got a ferry to catch. - If I can. Where the hell… Oh, my God… You're a ballsy bastard, making us come to Busan. Stealing from a thief. What's wrong with that? If you beg, we may let you walk away with some pocket change. But I'm here for $10 million. Hey. Business first. - Where is it? - Over there. Appraisal in #1503. Bring it. Alpha team, move! Protect the tenants and sweep thoroughly. Send in the SWAT! Alpha take the entrance, Bravo cover the back. Move in quietly. Yenicall, it's chaotic down here. - The diamond? - I have it. Come down quick! Why here? Don't you remember this room? A long time ago… you sat right here. Right? Wei Hong! Is there time for whiskey? Was I sitting here? Who are you? There were two thieves here. No, three. If you don't comply before this burns out, you'll die one by one. We won't sell at that price. We want $500,000. That was your father? You won't last long with a good memory. Those who steal from me… Are all dead. That's fine. You'll be captured here, anyway. This is a fake! He fled downstairs. Wait. Send in the sniper! Hurry! Hold your fire! - Grenade! - Get back! Hey, Yenicall, are you all right? Did a war break out? Run! Men down! - Protect the tenants! - Charlie team, this way! Let's get up there! - Julie, cover the exit. - Come on in. Yenicall? What? Stop badgering me. Just wondering where you were. I think I'm near the elevator. Then you can just toss it. Can't I give it to you in person? Don't you trust me? Sure I do, but I heard some things. Cops are everywhere! We have to trust each other at a time like this. I'm on top of the elevator on the third floor. Come on, let's hurry. Let's get this thing done. He fell to the seventh floor. Bravo, one suspect apprehended on the seventh floor. The gunshots are closer now. Yenicall, are you here? Yes! Can you see me? I see you. Then toss it to me. FIRE SHUTTER I'm tossing you my life. All right, now! Wait for me downstairs. I told you that this is your hell. A small-time burglar without you? Why did you do it? Do what? Why did you cut the wire? Can't thieves do that? But you took the gold! All 68 kg of it! My friend. My old friend. Get your wound treated. You're fucked. Those Chinese will chase you until you die. I know. It'll be hell. And lonely. Please calmly exit the building. Moron. Didn't even know it was under his foot. - Wei Hong? - Okay. Macao Park is getting away! Hey. Get him! He received a ferry ticket. Get to the pier! Wei Hong! Freeze! From Hong Kong? You got orders not to arrest me. By those on your payroll? But not just in Hong Kong. Busan Pier, I mean, Busan Pier. Popie! Answer me! Andrew, do you see Popie? - Huh? - Grab him! What the hell are you saying? Excuse me. Hey, Popie! Popie, you got the diamond? Don't follow me! - Yo, Popie, come here! - Go away! Move! You're so dead! Let's chat, asshole! God damn it! Go away! - Are you okay? - He's okay. Good job. Hey, you! Stop! That's odd. Why is this diamond so fragile? Hey, Yenicall. I think we took the wrong diamond. Yenicall, you bitch! Yenicall! How much is he paying you for the replica? $20,000. Why? Send me one, too. I'll pay $50,000. Don't tell Popie. What are you doing there? Stealing. Bravo, keep sweeping. I was in the shower and heard the gunshots! What's going on? It's all over now. - Is it okay to go down? - Yes. - Is it safe? - I'll escort you there. Thank you. Thank you. I don't know if these will fit. I just need to cover my feet. Thank you. Take care, then. Zampano should've seen this. Chewingum would've been so proud of me. Why do I feel sad? No. The happy ending is mine. Wei Hong! Wei Hong! Stop! Inspector. I got Wei Hong. Inspector, I got him! Sir, why aren't you answering! - Whoa! - What's up? The cops didn't find this stash. Poor Popie. He got four years. Where is Yenicall? She's in Hong Kong to sell it, but who'd buy it at that price? She'll end up just crawling back to me. Why? Going to Hong Kong? I am so sick and tired of Hong Kong. What kind of wine would you like? Just give me a glass of red. This airline has the best white wine. - Not that. Bring us Meursault. - Yes, sir. DREAMING OF THE KOREAN LOUVRE That's me. Are you meeting your boyfriend in Hong Kong? No, a colleague. A woman. Hong Kong's cuisine is wonderful. How about a dinner to celebrate this serendipity? Please don't refuse. It'd be impolite. My mom always said to me, "Be careful with women." But need I be careful even abroad? It's just a dinner. Is it a yes or a no? You make it… impossible to refuse. NEED THE FENCE LIST? Mother of all bitches, how did she find me? Sis! So happy to see you! Look at me shaking! - You're like my real sis. - And the diamond? In my room. I'll give you 30% for that list. And you pay for my month-long hotel bill. So, I brought someone to pay it. This doesn't feel right. I got a bad deal. The price of gold went up. Macao Park? Did you really pray… that we should never meet again? Can't we talk face to face? We can start all over again. And we will. But there are too many eyes around you. One moment. - Here's the key, sir. - Thank you. Are you in Hong Kong? The weather's really nice here. I'll call you back. I've got one last thing to steal. Your colleague is still underwater? She deserves to drown. She has a big bill to pay. I just stopped by the front desk. Did you pay her bill? No, someone already did, and went up for her luggage.
