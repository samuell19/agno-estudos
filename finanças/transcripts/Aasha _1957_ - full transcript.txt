Run for you lives! Madam is here! Sonny, you are again over here? - Where else will I go? Sonny! - Aunt! How many times have I told you... that sons of landlords don't play with their lackeys. I was just... - What did you say? Who else do I play with then? There's only one landlord for every area. Do one thing. Hire some landlords from other places to play with me. Be quiet! Did you see you son? His tongue is becoming very sharp. Your pampering will spoil him completely. You don't even scold him. Oh! I will scold him. Kishore! - Yes dad! Dare if you ever disobey your aunt? - But I always obey her. Better tell her. The people are awakening. Ask her to order me around in a softer tone. You are absolutely right! Sister, Try ordering him in a softer tone. Brother! You dare to explain to me! How can that be? I was explaining to Kishore. Yes dad! - Let's go from here! What are you staring at? Let's go! Why did you retreat? First you, aunt! Obedient sons always follow the footsteps of their elders. Well said, son! Say what you may, sister but the kid's got modesty. He sometimes go a little crazy due to his youthful caprice. But that's no fault of his. After all, it's youth. Dad! Youth is crazy... - Oh do be careful... Brother, what's this nonsense? I am afraid he might be insane. You handle him. I'll go and make preparations to welcome our guests. Frankly speaking, dad. If aunt had been a man, she'd have definitely become a Collector someday. She is no less now. Whatever you say. Only the luckiest gets a sister like her. Hey, who's dead? - We've lost our appetite. May God rest his soul in peace. And bless you with a little wit. For how many years have you been working for me? Three years. - Have you been going hungry since? No boss. This is the first time. - Then why talk nonsense? I can understand your problem. But they think that you are the nephew of the landlord of Belapur. And your mother runs the entire district. Why then would you lack any money? I sure am the nephew of a Jagirdar. But, I hardly get an allowance of Rs. 700 p.m. from there. And that too by the grace of my uncle. If my mom can help it, she'll cut short my allowance to 250. Where is Heera? - He had gone to you. Let him come. I think today the golden bird is arriving. Did you see how your son behaved shamelessly before the doctors? When will he ever understand that he's the only heir? And someday, he'll inherit this entire burden. Well said! Aunt, may dad life forever. Why then do I have to worry about this burden? Does that mean you won't help your father in his old age? Answer her. - Should I? Then, what are you for? Sonny! - My lips are sealed! Brother! - Let him be. He's just a kid. He'll understand with age. Sire, well said! - Keep going with the massaging. I say, he'll understand nothing. I'll send him Bombay to Raj. Brilliant idea! I'll go there and become an actress. I come to thee, forsaking the entire world! I'll see what you become. He's going to learn in this village. With Raj in the city, he'll at least learn proper etiquettes. Well said! In a week or two, Raj will surely make a man out of him. Answer her! - Should I? No matter how much you wash an ass, it'll never become a cow. Bravo, my son! You are absolutely right! Brother! - I am quiet. Keep massaging. You do know Grace Tailor. - I do, sir. My suit is ready and lying at the shop. Talk the owner into giving it and bring me my new suit. What about the payment? If I had the money, wouldn't I've gone myself? Tomorrow is the birthday of Nirmala's uncle Chamanlal Lakhpati. Nirmala will be also be performing. I should at least go in a new suit before my girlfriend. With all due respect, sir! You wore and discarded many a new suits for your love. But, so far, I haven't heard you ask for a wedding suit. You are still immature. I am foresighted. Follow me! Have you understood? - What is this? Cheque book! This big! Of what bank is it? Of my bank. Raj Bank Unlimited. Heera, this is Ali Baba's treasure. - Treasure? Open Sesame! Do you see this? These eyes, these features, this style, this modesty. First of all, she's a pretty devil. And secondly, the only heir to her father's legacy. I have to charm these two beauties and that's no easy job. Do you know her name? It's Nirmala. Come come Kanhaiyya, O trickster Come come Kanhaiyya, O trickster No way will I give you...

Thank God it never caused an earthquake. Do you call this a dance? - Only the stars had to break down! Do you from where did this energy come into her dance today? Man, you are quite smart. How about you tell us too? I'll tell you. Look who's sitting next to uncle. Understand now. He's the guy who is courting our friend. Nirmala is very soon to marry Raj. - Come and sit over here, dear. Now I know why your dance was so exciting today. What do you mean? - What I mean is... today, whatever you did was for Raj and not us. Uncle Sohan! - Blushing! I understood all along. I shall be taking your leave now. - What's the hurry? Raj and Nirmala must be cursing me for disturbing them. See you later. Mr. Sohanlal is a very lively person. Definitely! Meeting such people surely buoys up the spirits. Well then Nirmala, meet you tomorrow evening. I am sorry but tomorrow evening I've the drama rehearsal. Postpone it for day after tomorrow. - It's very difficult. It's okay. I'll come day after tomorrow. Goodbye then. - Goodbye! Raj, don't forget to write to your mother. This is not something to forget. Bye. - Goodbye! Uncle! - What is it, dear? Why are you hastening to get me married? You find a good suitor and a family man like Raj only by sheer luck. It'd be folly to let go of such a good opportunity that's come to you. Uncle, you are broad minded in almost everything. But, you do not wish to give me the freedom regarding my marriage. Why is that? Can anyone else think more than me what's best for you? Don't you like Raj? - It's got nothing to do with liking. I know, you don't like me staying here any more. You want to marry me off and send me away as soon as possible. Isn't this the fact? Naughty girl! This is what you are saying how. But after marriage, you won't even want to come here. Uncle! - Come now. You haven't yet met my father. - But I do meet his daughter everyday. You become such a hero! I may not be a historic hero but I sure am your Kishore. Don't change the topic. Tell me when are you meeting my father? Your father? I'll definitely meet him on our wedding day. And we'll marry without his consent! At least let him see you once. That's why I gave you my photo. But the photo can't talk. So, when are you coming over? If you are so persistence then, I'll definitely come next Sunday. In the last 6 months, 24 Sundays came and you made 24 promises. Don't come now and I'll bring dad to your house. Will do. - He's asked to meet you so many times. What's your address? Are you serious about it? - Is there any problem? Then write it down. Heart avenue, Love lane and House of Hope. Wherever you see, you'll know that's where I reside. What's this gag? Give me your real address. This is the real address. Anyway, take down the fake one. Raj, I mean, Raj Mahal, Raj Narayan Road, Raj Bhonkli... Bombay... You know the name. Your Kishore. What are you doing? You act so innocent! This is a hotel and not a refugee camp. Let go of my bag! Aren't you ashamed to trouble a lady? A woman like talking of shame just doesn't sound right. Pay up for three days and take your bag. I've no money on me right now. The man I came with duped me and left. I know nothing! I'll send you the money order as soon as I reach home. You can take down my address. A homeless with an address? Who knows where will you be next? Let me have my money or else...! - Hey mister, what's the matter? Who the hell are you? - Name's John Doe. John Doe! - That's right. Why are you troubling this poor lady? She may look a lady to you but in fact, she's a tramp. Three days ago she came with a man. Had a ball. And now, she's quietly slipping out without paying up. But, why don't you understand that poor lady is a victim of a philander. What's her fault in it? Put her bills into my accounts. Your account? How come your account? Just a minute! He is Mr. Raj's guest. He's waiting in his room. He's the son of the Jagirdar of Belapur. Hello sir! - Hello! The Jagirdar of Belapur! I am sorry I made a mistake! It happens! Miss Munni, you bill is cleared. You may leave. Arrange for a cab for her. Hello! - Hello! Oh you! Perhaps you need fare to go home? Oh no, sir! I've come to thank you for helping a lowly woman like me. It's okay. Nothing great about it. After all, a man in need is a man indeed. I've never seen a more philanthropist like you. Today, you've saved me from great shame. How can I ever repay you? No need for that. If you are truly a decent girl then... cast away your indecent lifestyle and love destitution. Hunger can be very cruel. But, it's not worth a woman's honour. Try treading on a new path, sister. - Sister! Did you call me sister? I promise you! Henceforth, I'll honour this word. I'll drink my blood, go hungry but will never sell my body. Never again, brother! Yes! - Where are you? I am over here. - Come out! Where were you all this time? I've grown grizzled waiting for you. Not your hair but your blood's turned white. As soon as you set foot into the city, you began to make my uncle famous. That happens. But, why are you getting at me? What have I done? You are asking me? Why did you have to speak to that tramp? Why did you clear her bill? The entire hotel is making fun of me. I lost my honour. What was she to you? She was my sister. - What did you say? Not mine. Must be yours. I've only helped a poor lady. I did not rob or steal. Rather I thought, you ditched her and ran off. Kishore! - Yes brother! Do you know why you've been sent here? For training. Aunt asked me to learn city lifestyle from you and return. Forget it! What will you learn? Why brother? I am no donkey but a man. Why wouldn't I learn if I have a teacher like you? Then listen. This is a city. - So it is. And you are the son of a very rich lord. So I am. Your demeanour, your mien, manner of talking should all be aristocratic. You should not associate yourself with poor man at all. No never. But, I never associate with them. I only embrace them. But, this won't work here. - Okay. From now on, you do as I say. - Affirmative. If I go right, you go right. - Right! If I go left, you go left. - Left. And what if you hang upside down? - You too do the same thing. I get it! Follow the master! Here you go! I happens! Once again. From today I pledge that I shall copy you. And I shall stick to you as a shadow all the time. So tell me, what should I do now? Yes brother? - Stand up straight! So master, what should I do first? Get into the shower, wash off the rural dust and put some city powder. Will do. - Then change up. Will do. - Look! I've got new clothes for you. The bathroom's that way. - Okay! Who is it? - It's Heera. What is it? - Come out fast! Brother! I'll be out right away! Who called you? - Who did? Go and clean up yourself. - Will do. What is it? - Come fast. The prey is here. Back in my town, I've seen fruits falling from a tree. But in the city, it's the first time I am seeing a girl fall from a tree. Shut up! Aren't you ashamed to laugh at someone? That's no decency. Sorry sister. Climb up again. I promise you I won't laugh again. Do I have to tell you? This is a girl's hostel. Get down! Where did he get down! Hey, get back here! You never came and it began to grow dark My love, should I wait some more or do I go back How long do I wait for you? How long do I wait for you? My gaze wearied expecting you My gaze wearied expecting you The night is approaching... The night is approaching, I am panicking What do I say, afar lies my village My love, should I wait some more or do I go back You never came and it began to grow dark My love, should I wait some more or do I go back How very stealthily I came... Sneaking from all eyes here I came Sneaking from all eyes here I came How very stealthily I came... My heart pounded faster... My heart pounded faster, at ever step I feared disaster Hope I do not face disgrace My love, should I wait some more or do I go back You never came and it began to grow dark My love, should I wait some more or do I go back How do I spend the time in wait... How do I spend the time in wait, for love, I beseech you, do come For love, I beseech you, do come Do show your face now... Do show your face now, do come before me now Since when have I been calling you My love, should I wait some more or do I go back You never came and it began to grow dark My love, should I wait some more or do I go back O my love... Hey, who are you? My love, you have come! - O beloved, where had I gone? My love, I've nearly shriveled waiting for you. Liar! You look all blossomed like a rose. Go on, say the next dialogue! Your forgot your lines! Let down the curtains! What's your name? - Kishore Kumar... Why did you ruin our program? Who let you in without permission? If you've cooled down then can I say something? Speak! - Very well. Believe me that I am a respectable man from a respectable family. And then... then... then... Say it! - What do you mean? I was standing by the college wall when a girl... What? A girl! - A girl was scaling the wall. Who was that girl? Do you know her? - Very well. Who was that girl? - She is here Where is she? - She's the one. What? - I am sorry. She is the one! - Who, me? Not even her. She is the one. - Who, me...? No, not even her. She is so tiny. How can she scale the wall? Forget it! As I was saying... All I want to say is, Bad habits breed fast. Seeing her scaling, I too got excited. I jumped up on the wall the landed on the ground. And from the ground up on the tree and down back again. Seems you are a bit eccentric. - Well, I sure am. The police will fix you up. What did you say your name was? You write it. - What's your father's name? Mr. Hasmukhlal, Jagirdar of Belapur. Are you the son of Belapur's Jagirdar? I sure am. Do I get punished for that too? Be grateful that you are safe. - Thank God! Your father has donated 100,000 to our college fund. I don't want him to lose face. But, I'll surely inform him of your actions. You may go. - Thank you very much! When you are writing to my father, do add that I am fine. It will save my three paise. [0.03 rupees] What is it? - Sire, a letter for you. Has to be from my Kishore. Sire, is it a very good news? - Congratulations! What for? - My son has become matured. He has begun to flirt with girls in the city. Brother, why are you singing praises of youth early in the morning? I was only getting myself massaged. - Whose letter is this? It's a letter from the Warden of Girls college. Has she asked for more donations? - Not donations. She has complained. Complaints? Whose complaint? Of Kishore. - Kishore? He already brought disgrace to the family as soon as he reached the city. Good thing we gave donations to this college. Else, they would have surely handed him over to the cops. Who cares what they do with him... but, the family reputation is ruined for sure. I say, it wouldn't be wise to have him stay there for even a day. You are absolutely right. He stays back a few days more and all the girls colleges will shut down. I had warned you not to send him. He's still very innocent. Influenced by the city life, he'd do something wrong. I had sent him to the city to be a man and not become a cat-burglar. A donkey will always be a donkey, no matter where he goes. I'll write to Raj right away and demand an answer. After all, it was Raj's responsibility. It's a letter from mom. - Aunt's letter? What did she write? The warden of Girl's hostel wrote a complaint to uncle. And mom held me responsible for your actions. That happens! - What happens? Aunt is very smart. After all, it is you fault. Mine! How come? If only you hadn't left me alone in the hotel, I wouldn't have gone out. And towards the girl's hostel and would be in a mess. Answer to that! Kishore, stop babbling! - Done. As soon as you stepped into the hotel, you helped that slut and disgraced me. Then by breaking into the girl's hostel... you are ready to dishonour your family reputation! Brother, you never take a breath when you start talking. Frankly speaking. If you see the girl I saw in the hostel... I bet, you'd want to humble yourself too. Forget it! What's so great about her? I can't even describe her. Look into my eyes. She is such a pretty picture that you really want to hang on the wall. She is no girl. She's a marble statue. If Mr. Shah Jahan had seen her, he'd have never built the Taj Mahal hotel. My guess is, you saw a girl for the first time. If you had happened to see my Nirmala, you'd be in the hospital by now. To hell with Nirmala! If you had happened to see the girl of my dream, you'd be dead by now. Is she that lethal? Brother! - Kishore! Your dream girl standing beside my girl would be like... a cycle standing beside an express train. Brother! - Kishore! And if your girl came by my... my... - What my? Came before my mystery woman, it'd be like... before an aeroplane... What before an aeroplane? - A crow is flying. If I had known her name and address, I'd have taken you there to faint. Forget her. Come, let me show you my Nirmala. I'd eat my words if you don't get bedazzled by her. Is that so? Let's go then. - Come. The house is very grand. - It's owner is much more grander. We'll see and decide. Let's go. Never cross the table. Move back! Move around it. Sit down! - Will do. Hey, it's the same girl! How are you, Nirmala? - I am fine. So, you are Nirmala! Hello to you too! Hello! - Hello! Saroj was speaking highly of you. You helped her in time of need. It was just... I'll fetch uncle right away. Please have a seat! Brother! - What is it? We were hacking our brains for no reason at all. What do you mean? - You express train... and my aeroplane are one and the same. What do you mean? - I was speaking of this girl. This girl? - Yes. Where did you meet her? - In the hostel. Where else? Remember! Next time you mention her name with respect in my presence. Done! Who might you be? - He's the only son of my uncle. I am Mr. Kishore. - Kishore! The Jagirdar of Belapur! Not so. I am the junior Jagirdar. By God's grace, my father is alive. That's exactly what I meant. You misinterpreted me. Please have a seat! - Sit down! You too sit down Raj. Which college do you study in? Raj College. - Where would that be? It's right before you. Actually, dad has handed me in his care to learn the ways of the world. I have by the way, studied till 10th grade. That's more than enough. - True. Only if you have passed it. Aren't you even 10th pass? - By God's grace. So what? You are a Jagirdar's son. You don't have to do a job. I wrote to your uncle about your wedding. I too wrote to them. I expect uncle and mom here by the end of the week. Very well. Come dear. A very important guest has come to our house today. I know him. I had met him one day in the hostel. In the hostel. - Yes. But, what was he doing in the girl's hostel? I remember now! His father has donated a big sum to you hostel. I had gone to take the donation. Will you excuse us? Kishore has to go to the bazaar. Which bazaar? - Bhendi bazaar. He's new in town. Thus he's not familiar with the names of lanes. Let's go, Kishore! - Okay brother. But you forgot to drink this. - I sure did! Then drink it! Good bye then. - Good bye! What happened? - Where did it go? What? - I had kept it right here. What? Did you lose something? - Well yes. I had an organ with me. An organ? - A mouth organ. Here you go! - Thanks! I love to play music. - That's a good habit. It's in the family. My dad too loves music. You don't say! - He can't eat without... breaking an instrument or two. You forgot your mouth organ. - Good bye. Hurry up, will you? First step into the city has brought us bad luck. How dare you! Can't you see where you are going? What happened? - Can't you see you spoiled my dress? I am sorry. It's not my fault. The road is dirty. That doesn't mean you throw the dirt and soil my clothes. I am sorry! - Nothing doing! You dare to behave out of your league and brazen it out! I've already apologized to you. Why then get so worked up? The heck I am! Do you know who I am? And, do you know who I am? - Who the hell do you think you are? The same thing you think you are. Understand? I will very soon. Take down her licence plate number. My vehicle hasn't been registered yet. I've just bought it from the showroom. What's this nonsense! Mom! What a surprise! You should at least have informed me. If I had, how would I know that in the city, he sleeps till midday? Sonny! - Aunt! I slept early in the morning. - What were you doing all night? Waiting for brother. Now I'll say it. Don't know where he disappears all night? Don't worry. Now that I am here, I'll find out very soon. What have you put on? In spite of coming to the city, you are still so very rustic. Not so, madam. He's changed a lot here. Back in the village, he used to wear a loincloth. But here in the city, he's started to wear beddings. Raj, who is this Chamanlal and how is his daughter Nirmala? The girl is very nice. - She sure is. But Chamanlal is not her father. He's her uncle. That means, she is an orphan. - You could say that. Her father left her a rich legacy. Her uncle is only her guardian. He is a very well-to-do gentleman and is highly esteemed by the society. Everyone addresses him as Lakhpati(millionaire). Is that Chamanlal Lakhpati you are talking about? That's him! I knew it all along that aunt would know him. There is no rich guy in this country whom my aunt doesn't know. You shouldn't talk much. Chamanlal Lakhpati is a very talkative man. I had met him once in the train on my way to Haridwar. He was travelling without ticket in the first class. But, that's history. Now, he's made a lot of money. To hell with his wealth. The true wealth is actually Nirmala's beauty. If Mr. Shah Jahan had been alive now... Master, is she that beautiful? - So beautiful that... you can throw away all your wealth for a mole on her cheeks. Aren't you ashamed to talk so brazenly before your aunt? Inform Lakhpati that I am coming to see Nirmala tonight. Let me freshen up now and pray. Go and get everything ready. Please come this way! Please have a seat! Please make yourself comfortable! Excuse me while I arrange for your tea. Aunt, how about you sit now? You have plenty of time to check out the house. Kishore! - I am quiet. Hope you had no trouble in your journey. Why would I? I had bought the tickets. Who travels without tickets? - People like you do. I knew it was you... who was travelling without ticket 10 years ago in the Haridwar train. Hope you remember. You must be mistaken. Gangu, bring in the snacks. I've never been to Haridwar. - Watch out, sire! As I recall, I had a friend who looked exactly like me. His name too was Chamanlal. He used to go on pilgrimages. He wasn't doing so good. Forget it! - Yes, forget it! How are you doing? I heard that the girl owns a legacy. - Whatever you see around is hers. I am only the guardian of her estate. Who owns this house? - I own only this house. But, I've taken a loan on it. - Say that it's mortgaged. Truly spoken! Where are the papers? - Aunt! Actually my elder brother, Nirmala's father bequeathed 100,000 to her. I invested that amount in business. By God's grace, it's multiplied four times. What? Only 400,000? I've deposited that amount in the Citibank. Your brother is the proprietor of that bank. I know. That is why that bank is soon to go bankrupt. Bankrupt! But, it's doing fine. - The heck it will. To give out loans to the circus companies. That's a real good business. Even if the circus fails, the animals will still survive. Kishore! - I am quiet! Anyways! I've heard all this. How about you show the girl too? Come dear! Madam is here to see you. No need to feel shy. Come now! Madam, she is a bit shy. This way, dear. Greet everyone! Munshi! - Yes, ma'am! Isn't she the same biker girl? - She sure is! You are highly mistaken. She can't even rid a cycle. Has to be Manju, our neighbour. She loves to ride bikes. She resembles a lot in Nirmala. Kishore! - Yes aunt? Seems like everyone in this family resembles someone or the other. Who is it? The agent! Yes, Mr. Chamanlal is here. Call for you. Hello, Chamanlal speaking. What is it? What? What are you saying? The bank failed! All my money! I knew that bank wouldn't do good whose proprietor is my brother. What would the Jagirdars know to run a business? Let's go, Raj. Let's go, mom. - Please don't go this way! I've lost my money but I still have my honour. Please don't judge an educated girl of rectitude with money! You are blessed with everything. What do you need our money for? You need a home-maker. But, you still have to take the status into consideration. Don't tell me your love too failed with the bank. Kishore! - Yes brother! Don't talk like a fool! - I won't. How can the nephew of a Jagirdar marry the daughter of a bankrupt? But, you are only the nephew of the Jagirdar. Where else, I am the son of a Jagirdar. I hope you don't mind me marrying the girl of this bankrupt man. Kishore! - Aunt! I won't shut up now. But don't you worry. I won't do it. How can I, a 10th fail spoiled son of a rich man be worthy of a Graduate? Leash your tongue! Mr. Chamanlal, we do not accept this proposal. There's the door! You came here like a police coming a thief's house. You'll be pleased to hear that... the man you met in the train was indeed my father. And the girl with whom you had a row in the morning is me. I knew it all along. This family is a family of dissemblers. Who will ever make a girl like you her daughter-in-law? And who ever wants to make an old hag like you her mother-in-law? Good day! - Let's go, Raj! What have you done, my dear? - It's okay, uncle. Mr. Jagirdar! - Who called me Jagirdar? Bless you sir! Please have a seat! Who are you? - I am Kamini's father. Must be. But, who is Kamini? - Don't you know who she is? To know a girl, one has to first look at her. Aren't you yet satisfied after seeing her so many times? You very well know who Kamini is and also that you've violated her. You've sullied an innocent... - No more talks! I don't know anyone by that name. And without knowing her, you dishonoured her! Are you not ashamed to use such reproachful words for your daughter? I was so ashamed upon hearing her shameful act that... I wanted to kill myself. But I've to live not for myself but for her. Then go ahead and live. Every man has the right to live. He also has the right to defend his honour. Now tell me! Are you ready to marry her and save her from disgrace? Or, do I have to demand it forcibly? - You dare to threaten me! Why don't you say it clearly that knowing my family status, you want to dump someone else's sin on me and extract money from me? Stretch out your hands if you are begging. You think you can pay off my daughter's honour! You pay for something you buy. What I am giving you is alms. Keep it to yourself! I don't want money! I want decency in alms. If you are man enough and have even the slightest of decency in you... then, take the hand of that innocent whom you have debased! This is the room of a Jagirdar's son and not an ashram for fallen women. Neither am I the guardian of honour... nor have I to do anything with your daughter. Do what you like! Take a walk! I am leaving. But remember that I'll make you pay for my girl's honour. Sister! - What is it, brother? Why hasn't Raj arrived yet? I had strictly told him to come. He must be held up somewhere. We'll be taking your leave now. Tell him we were here. Sire! Mr. Raj is here! He is here! Good! God bless you, dear. I am sorry for the delay. I'll fetch my gun right away. I've already kept it in the car. - First time you've spoken wisely. Bye mom! - What's this? You've just arrived. Freshen up! Have something to eat. What are you saying? He is a warrior's son. He'll hunt and eat. Fine. - Shall we leave then? Let's go. Did you kill something? What do I say? It was a fox in lion's clothing flying in the air. Young man! Shoot like this in the air and you are sure to shoot one of us. That happens! Shoot here and there and you'll fall into trouble with the law. Who cares about the law when the law-keepers are with us? Don't live under this impression. Law does not take lightly to friendship and courtesy. We could have killed a couple of mice in this much time. Forget the mice. Let's go our separate ways and meet right here in the evening. Brother, where do I go? - Follow your nose. So, you came here too! Why not? Until you don't marry my daughter... I'll follow you to the end of the world. Have pity on your old bones and go away from here. Stop right there! Why worry about my old age? Pity your youth! So, do you accept my daughter's hand in marriage? What will you do if I refuse? If you can destroy the honour of a poor girl... then I can break your family high-handedness too. I agree that you are a Jagirdar's son and holds high esteem in the society. If you did not yield nicely, I'll expose you to your parents. From where will you get the proof? - I have the proof. Here is your picture you gave to my daughter. Anyone can have my picture. - But not with a love note behind it. To Kamini, my dream world, A humble gift from Kishore. This humble gift will cease to exist before it reaches mom. Why need to go that far? The deputy superintendent and the Collector are present. I'll show them this picture and demand my rights from them. Your death is much more closer to you. Let me have that photo! - Over my dead body! I'll take it by hook or by crook! - Mr. Collector! Mr. DSP! Murder! What will happen now? Law does not take lightly to friendship and courtesy. Young man! Shoot like this in the air and you are sure to shoot one of us. Shoot someone or the other! Who is it? Wait right there! I am on my way! What happened? Who is it? Where are you? I am dead! - What happened? Who's calling? Hey man, who are you? Blood! Brother! It's blood! - What happened? Look at this! - Who's he? I don't know who he is. - Kishore, what have you done? I didn't do anything. I only fired a shot. And it hit him. What have you done? Let's take him to the hospital. He can be saved. Wait! He is dead. - Dead! What now? As you know, the DSP and the Collector are very strict. Better run away before they land up here. All right. I'll go home. - Not home. You'll caught there. The family reputation will be completely destroyed. Uncle will kill himself out of shame. If you care for his life, run away to another town. Shall I meet dad once? - I'll explain to your father. Now, take this money for your expense. I'll meet you secretly. - Brother! Don't you worry about anything. I'll definitely save your life. Now, go! Kishore! Where are you? Who are you? Get up! He has been shot. - Shot? Where are these two gone? Mr. Raj! - Coming! The whole day got wasted. Even today... Water! - Hand me the water bag. Who are you? Who shot you? Kamini... - Did Kamini shoot you? My daughter... - Tell us who shot you. Tell us who shot you! The son of Belapur's Jagirdar... - Did Kishore shoot you? Doesn't this gun belong to Kishore? - Well... Do not be afraid! Speak! How do I say that this gun indeed belongs to Kishore. Please save her! Law never understands friendship and courtesy. Send the body for post-mortem. And arrest Kishore immediately! Sister, you know that Kishore can't even hurt a fly. This is a false allegation. Kishore is not like this. But, why did he run? If only he had consulted me before absconding... I'd have gladly taken the blame upon myself. But would have never let Kishore come to any harm. The family reputation is ruined to dust. How will face the world now? Sister, you take care of the house. I'll go in search of Kishore. Until and unless we don't find him, how will we know what the truth is? Why worry yourself when I am there? I'll put my life on stake in search of Kishore. No matter what, I'll bring my innocent brother to you. Before the police gets him, bring him to us once. We'll give up every penny, ever piece of property we own... but will let no harm come to Kishore. Sire, I am really very sorry for whatever happened. But the law does not respect friends nor foe. We have to search the house. But, you can't search this respectable house. It's not right to interfere in legal procedures. Go ahead and search. - Thank you! Wealth is lost. House is auctioned. Know not what else has fate in store for us. Uncle, wealth comes and goes. Good thing we lost it. If we hadn't lost it then I'd be now married to a greedy man like Raj. Whatever God does is for the best. No my child, this has all happened because of my ignorance. If only I hadn't deposited the money in the Citibank... we wouldn't be seeing this day. Uncle, I have one more complaint with you. What is that? If it had been your daughter, would you've have complained the same way? God bless you, dear! You are blessed not only with a beautiful face... but also with a more beautiful heart. How would my heart turn beautiful if you hadn't give me nice teachings? Gangu, take the luggage. - Let's board into some hotel. Do not waste away all the time we spent together. If not me, then kindly have mercy on Nirmala. You considered her as your daughter. Could you bear to see her wander the streets? No need to get emotional. You have to evacuate today itself. I am begging you for only 2 months. You are not begging me for 2 months but for 1500 rupees. I've fixed 750 rupees per month house rent. Moreover, I've even taken three month's rent as earnest money. So, you've priced our friendship at 1500 rupees! Remember the day when you came to my father in tatters. You looked awful and hunger-bitten. My father took you in his fold as an orphan and hired you. Taught you every trick of the trade. That time, you did not dare to sit in my father's presence. And today, you speak of a mere 15000 rupees... before the son of your benefactor and your lifelong friend! Now I understand that my father did not feed an orphan. He raised a serpent! Do you want my guards to throw you out? Silence! You were once a beggar and now you talk of guards! Remember one thing! It doesn't take time to change. Wish instead of an unfaithful friend I had bred a faithful dog. Wish I had red a faithful dog... Wish I had red a faithful dog... Wish I had red a faithful dog... Help! Is this Mr. Sohanlal's office? I am Nirmala speaking. Is your boss in? He is not? My uncle had gone to meet him yesterday but hasn't returned yet. What did you say? He fell down the stairs! Belapur Murder case! Ronaq Lal murdered! Kishore, the son of Belapur's Jagirdar murdered Ronaq Lal. The culprit is absconding. Ronaq Lal murdered! Please have a seat. I am a little busy. Will talk to you later. Very well. Kishore, you! Look at it carefully and then answer. I've never seen this man before. - Never? That's strange. Your father's dying statement was that Belapur's Jagirdar's son shot him. And you say you never saw him? Inspector, is that man a murderer? - Yes. Do you know him? I do. He looks familiar. Think harder. This man is her father's murderer. I can't remember anything. It must be my imagination. My name is Nirmala. My uncle disappeared from the hospital today morning. The hospital staff says that they have reported to the police. We have the report and the search is on. But, there is no news of his whereabouts. Leave your address. We'll inform you as soon as we hear from him. I'll myself come and inquire. Actually, I've no fixed place to stay in this town. Do not lose hope. Sister, you just mentioned that you have no place to stay. Maybe like me, you too are fraught with destiny. After the death of my father, I too am all alone in this world. If you wish, you can stay with me. A trouble shared is a trouble halved. But, you've never seen me before now. How will you adjust me in your home? You are in distress as well as I am. Both belong to the same club. What more introduction do we need? Miss Nirmala, this is indeed a very good thing. You'll be able to help each other in times of need. Very well, Inspector. I'll explain it to Inspector Jagdish. It was a call from Inspector General. He was saying about Belapur Murder case. Ronaq Lal's murderer Kishore is absconding. You've appointed in-charge of hunting him down in Bombay. Side by side, you've even been asked to remain cautious. The matter is very serious. Who is it? Leave me! Dare if you uttered a sound! The cops are after me. Open the door! Open the door! Just a minute! - Open the door! Inspector! Please come in! Did a young man come running here? Nobody came here. Whom are you looking for? A murderer. I think he came in here. Perhaps you didn't see him. Can I search your house? I've been right here since the past half an hour. Apart from you no one else came here. How was he dressed? He's wearing checked shirt and khaki half pant. Khaki half pant? - He's a very active young man. I think he went that way. - What? I saw a man in that getup run that way a few minutes ago. That's where I saw him running in that lane over there. Thank you very much! Perhaps you do not know that he has a prize of Rs. 5000 on his head. Five thousand rupees? Can I ask you why you saved a murdered from the police? Though I was a stranger, why did you still provide shelter to me? I've done no favour on you. Once, I too had fallen into such a trouble. And a great man like you... regardless of his honour had helped me in distress. Oh! So you paid me back for someone else's favour? Not there. Please sit here. - Thank you! You've helped me this far. How about a little more help? What can I do for you? I am very exhausted running. Let me spend the night here with ease. Why only one night. Stay here as long as you wish. Please feel at home. Please come this way! Will meet you in the morning. Out of the fire into the frying-pan. Now I get it! This Guardian Angel has fallen for the prize money. Excuse me! Go to sleep, dear moon, moonbeam beseeches to thee Go to sleep, dear moon, moonbeam beseeches to thee Implores to thee... moonbeam beseeches to thee Go to sleep, dear moon, moonbeam beseeches to thee Know not from where hast thou come... Know not from where hast thou come laden with sadness are thy eyes What is it that thou fear when I guard thee with watchful eyes What is it that thou fear when I guard thee with watchful eyes Seeing thee forlorn... Seeing thee forlorn my heart too grieves Go to sleep, dear moon, moonbeam beseeches to thee Go to sleep, dear moon, moonbeam beseeches to thee A cloud shalt I become... A cloud shalt I become and conceal thee from all eyes My life I shalt lay down but shalt save thine from evil eyes My life I shalt lay down but shalt save thine from evil eyes Who can ever dare... Who can ever dare to step into my courtyard, I say Go to sleep, dear moon, moonbeam beseeches to thee Go to sleep, dear moon, moonbeam beseeches to thee Go to sleep, dear moon... Go to sleep, dear moon, go to sleep... Go to sleep... Go to sleep, dear moon, moonbeam beseeches to thee Go to sleep, dear moon... I didn't recognize you in confusion. - But now you have. Please open the door! - Not until morning. Go to sleep. Deepak Theatre. Wanted talented girls. She looks okay. Do you know how to dance? - I do. Show us a sample. You call that a dance? Dance is what you do by shaking your feet. She even knows this. - Do you know how to sing wing? I can sing but I don't know wing. Sing a song. In the rain... In the rain, I met you and you met me... You've passed in singing and dance. But, what about acting? Fact is, man should have a skull on his head and in that skull a brain. And then, acting is a piece of cake. - Show us a sample please! Sire, he is a tramp. Inspector, is this a bread? This bread is very deceptive. This has troubled me a lot. If only I had got this bread 12 years ago outside the prison... I wouldn't have to come back here again and again for this. Enough! Your time is up! - Is it really? I don't like the food here. I'll now go and eat in a big hotel. A vagabond am I... Ask her to perform a female role. - What do you mean? I mean, the role of an actress. Vyjayanti Mala. Vijayanti Mala? It's a bit difficult. But, will do. My heart swings, my body swings, I lose the peace of my heart... O, who plays the flute enchanting My heart swings, my body swings, I lose the peace of my heart... O, who plays the flute enchanting My! She's a killer! - So, what do you think? You can indeed act very well. - Thank you very much. No of fence but, can I tell you something? Our writer is an old man. And he's written the role for a heroine of his age. But you are... Oh so very young! How rude! First you exalt me and then you show me a thumbs down. God bless your old writer and his old actress. Good bye! Are there any other candidates? - Only two old women remaining. Send in the oldest of them. Am I right? Hello! - Hello! God bless you, dear! What is your name?? - I am called Mani Jeeva. Fine. Have you worked before in a theatre? I am quite antiquated. Maiden Theatres, Baliwala Theatres... all these companies started off and shut down before me. This is the old rice. She as both the age and experience. But her back is a bit too bent. This is an artist's back. It can straighten if need be. Marvelous! It's a miracle! - And why not? After all, she's lived through the revolution into the reality. But... - But what? You say it. - You say it! Your face is too wrinkled. So much old age won't do. Is that so? Well, youth is at your service too. What? - Yes. So, what do you think now? To hell with what we think. From today, you are hired. I don't need your job. I only came to teach you all a lesson. Good bye! Why are you mad at us? At least listen to us! First, will you listen to me? - Yes, we will. Will I be choosing the dramas? - Yes, you will. Will I be choosing the artists? - Yes, you will. We agree to all your conditions. - Now we are talking! How strange! I even forgot your face in my problems. But you remembered me very well. As per your promise, you've really changed yourself completely. The disciple has taken the right path but the master is still lost. But, what is this mystery? Why would you be killing anyone? I too understood only yesterday that not me but someone else is the killer. Who is it? What's the use of telling now? I suspect a man. Why don't you tell the police about your suspicion? Tell them? My mind hasn't been able to decide anything yet. The dead man in his dying statement has accused me as the murderer. Don't know why that good man had to put the blame on me. The whole incident is like one big riddle. Until the truth is not revealed, I do not wish to take the killer's name. I wish to maintain my silence till this matter is not resolved on its own Do as you think best. No need to worry at all. You have a house and a sister. Whatever I have is yours. Munni, my sister! Munni, I'll watch this drama. - You are talking insane. The police are looking for you everywhere... and you want to go to watch a drama! I'll definitely watch this drama. Nirmala is acting in it. Nirmala! Who is she? - Well, she is... I get it now! - What? Isn't that a fact? - What are you saying? Never fall in love. If you do, you'll be sorry These priests of beauty, who take the heart away In the beginning seems so innocent Holding their heart, they'll call out the name It's you... it's you... it's you alright Forget not this serpent of love will throw out poisonous fire It burns in the light and makes you restless at night Picks you up in bed of roses and makes you cry amidst the thorns Holding his heart, he'll call out your name It's you... it's you... it's you all right Brother! Is she badly hurt? - I think she's fainted. Let's take her to the doctor. Hello mother! Whom are you calling your mother? Get out of here! Oh my! What a rage! Such rage at this age! You sure must be a cannon ball in your youth. May you burn in Hell! What have you come here for? I've come to meet my sweetie pie. Where is my Munni? You've come in search for Munni! Welcome! She lives right here. I've found my lost beloved! I swear, I feel so heavenly. Beg your pardon. You haven't yet told me who you are. What is your name? Qutubuddin Aftabuddin Mohammed Bin Kasim Khan Abdul Rehman. I've been searching all over India for the past one month. For what? To see my Munni. Like a Devil I've been wandering here and there. For what? For my beloved. Where did she go? Oh yes! I haven't been bitten by a mad dog. Munni's love has driven me mad. Can't forget the day when I first set my eyes on that celestial beauty. From that day till now, I've been only chanting her name. Where's my Juliet? - Have patience. Have a seat. Munni, my dear! - What is it, mom? Who is this? - Who am I? Good God! You are asking me who I am? From where did you get this clown? - She's calling me a clown. Come to your senses, Munni! He's a business tycoon from the Middle East. He claims to love you. He's seen you before in the hotel. He's journeyed thousands of miles just in search of you. How about you show some manners and at least ask him to sit? What rubbish are you talking? Ask me not to sit but to express my love to her. You shameless creature! Let go of me! Brother Kishore, help me! What is it, Munni? Brother! - Munni!! Hello mother! - So, it's been you all along! Damn you! I'm going back to my village. This house is full of phoney baloneys. Brother, what have you done? I nearly fainted, you know? I am sorry. Life is after all a sham. But this sham has solved two big questions of mine. Which ones? Firstly, I am now completely assured of your chastity. The fear that I saw on your face when a stranger touched you... was impossible for even a respectable lady to show at a time like this. You've truly changed. So, you went through all this trouble just to test me? There is another purpose to it. I wanted to find out if anyone would recognize me in this getup. Brother! Who will ever recognize you when I failed to recognize you? I want to stage a play in the name of Abdul Rehman Arabi the name of which is Asha. - Asha! Very pretty name. I need your help for it. God forbid! What if someone recognized you? You are so naive! No one can ever imagine a fugitive... who is being sought by the police staging a drama on the stage. And besides, this is the only way to contact Nirmala. Though there is a little risk involved but, I've no other choice. As you wish. Maybe this way, we might meet the real culprit. Thank God that you escaped unharmed from the fire. I too am amazed at my near escape. I can't even remember how the fire took place or who saved me. I do remember someone's sweet voice soothing me in my unconscious state. Someone was taking me affectionately towards safety. But when I came around, there was no one there. It all seems like a dream. Hello Miss Nirmala! - Hello Mahadev? How is the boss? He is nowhere to be found. No hope if the work will start again. We are completely ruined! - City is not built in a day. Man has to hold on to hope. The rest is in God's hands. You are absolutely right. But right now, the theatre from Arab has created quite a blast in the city. Theatre from Arab? - Take a look at this. You may now know but he's presenting our program. The program that ruined us has become into a gold mine for him. If that is the case then I'll watch his drama today itself. I sell heart, is there anyone who will pay? To just anyone I am not giving away I sell heart, is there anyone who will pay? To just anyone I am not giving away Should have a pretty face, and with a youthful grace Anyone who sees her should feel that's her She's the one... she's the one... she definitely is the One... Think not the bargain to be low Enjoy the fruit shall he who sow Think not the bargain to be low Enjoy the fruit shall he who sow This bud shall blossom to a flower The world shall envy for it is jealous It'll laugh... laugh... laugh, my dear These terms are very important Anyone who fulfills them Gladly shall I give her my heart I promise I won't even charge But this I'll definitely say... - What? She's the one... she's the one... she definitely is the One... Welcome! Please have a seat. - Thank you! All I want to ask you if this song is your mind's creation. The mind is of God; the creation is of God. Where do I come in? You are not what you seem. - What do you mean? I first prepared this dance and then you stole it from me. You made so much money and fame out of my hard work. I'll sue you for this. - Go ahead and sue me. But first, how about telling me who you are where do you hail from? Haven't you heard of Miss Nirmala? - Of Deepak theatre? How fortunate of me! The one I was going to invite has herself come here. What do you mean? - I mean, your theatre has shut down. You'll now have to work in my theatre. You are a very strange man. I had come to fight with you. Forget it! I do not deal with fights. My first rule is to love God and his created Man. Spite is a Devil's job. So, do you accept my proposal? What are the terms? The first and the last term is that, as long as you are in my service... you shan't love nor marry in any condition. Why is that? What's that got to do with the job? This is a business secret. Normally it has been seen that married actresses report late for work. And even if they do happen to make it early... they bring along their children, maid, husband and other stuff. Now, will the theatre owner look after the heroine or her family? You are a very interesting man. - Thank you. Report on duty from tomorrow. - Definitely. Good bye! One, two, three, four. Only four more steps. And then after four weeks, Raj will no longer remain Raj. But, he'll become Rajkumar, Jagirdar of Belapur. Kishore will never be able to come in public. And uncle, grieving Kishore's parting and ignominy will succumb to his grief. A new threat has arisen. - It will die just as it has risen. But boss... - What is it? You did remove all the thorns in your flesh but your forgot Kamini. Give me a break! Now you are scaring me with insects too? Kamini is nothing but an ant to me. I can squash her whenever I like. Sometimes, the ant clings to the elephant so firmly that... it can't shake it off. - You are crazy. You don't know that Nirmala and Kamini are living under one roof. If Kamini happens to mention to Nirmala about her Kishore... you will be exposed. Nirmala is very smart. She'll immediately know that Kamini's Kishore is none other than Raj. It sure is a threat to some extent. But this threat can be warded off if we kidnap Nirmala. What do you say? Why touch a bomb when a cracker can do the trick? Your aim is to separate them both, right? Then, why not we kidnap Kamini? - What a groovy idea! Get to work. Excuse me! - Who are you? Don't be scared. I've brought you a message from Kishore. Here it is. - It really is from him. My dear Kamini... Dear Kamini.., Come along with my friend immediately. It's very important. Very important? Your Kishore. Please don't delay. Kishore is very sick. He's even asked your father to come. - Dad? Dad passed away long ago. What did you say? Sorry to hear that. But mind you. Don't break this news to Kishore. He'll be more grieved to hear about this. We are already very late. - Give me a minute. Let's go. - Come. Kishore, you are all right. Then why did you use an excuse to call me here? Some malady can't be seen on the face but eats him from within. What is it that ails you? - Ain't your parting an ailment? Circumstances kept me from coming to your house. So, how is your father? - Dad...? Why are you quiet? Is he all right? Dad... - Say it! He has been murdered. - What? Murdered! How unfortunate of me! Your father passed away... and I couldn't even give you moral support in your times of grief. I am a sinner! - Enough Kishore! Instead of consoling me, you are reassuring yourself! Now I'll never let you out of my sight. Henceforth, you'll stay with me. - How can I ever refuse? In the flesh of the nightingale lies the splinter of the nature The poet's brain is full with filth and muck of slimy creature Hello sir! - Welcome Miss Nirmala! What's the matter? You look worried. - Sort of. I was staying with a friend named Kamini. She's been missing since yesterday. - How did she go missing? What can I say? I only found this letter in the house. This clearly shows that Kishore called her on pretence of sickness. You mean the murderer Kishore! Has he started this business too? Who knows? - But why did your friend go? I get it now! Maybe they both are having an... What do you mean? - An affair is what I mean. Why don't you hand this letter to the cops? They will seek him out. No need. I am dead sure. Neither is Kishore a murderer nor has he abducted her. You are not matured enough to understand this. The heck he is that decent. Whatever. But, I've absolute faith in his decency. Great Kishore! What decency you have to even abduct girls now. Stop feeling sorry for yourselves and start worrying for tomorrow. Do you know that an Arab has created an uproar in the city? Not the Arab. But is drama surely has caused quite a stir in the city. Do you know anything about that Arab? Just that, his drama is a big smash hit. Have you heard anything else? - Nothing sir. You never hear what's important. I heard that apart from drama, that Arab knows many a tricks to make money. One day Ramu had mentioned this to me. But I ignored him thinking it to be a hearsay. Good going, idiot! You all need everything ready-made. You don't want to work for it. Should befriend this Arab somehow. He seems quite a resourceful man. I'll arrange everything. The heck you will. I'll do it myself. Hello! - Hello! These days, you are making the headlines. But, how did uncle give you the permission to act in the theatre? Why would I ever have to join the theatre if only uncle had been here? What happened to him? The world rebuffed him so much that he lost his sanity. And now, he's been missing since many days. Sorry to hear about that. I'll try to find him. Thank you. I have to go somewhere. Excuse me! Excuse me! Forget what happened in the past. I never did have such feelings. Dear Kamini.., Come along with my friend immediately. It's very important. Your Kishore. Brother, if you wanted to write a letter to Kamini by my name... you should have at least changed your handwriting first. You are a bad guy but an amateur one. Come in! Hello! - Welcome! Pleased to meet you. Have a seat! So, you are Raj? - Yes sir. Are you the son of Belapur's Jagirdar? Sir. I am his nephew. - Thank God for that! If you had been his son, the police would be looking for you. How was that? - Tough. Take no of fence. Whoever I like, I meet him with this fervour. What brings you here? - I had heard a lot about you. I wanted to meet you. That's why I am here. I am honoured that such a big man came to meet a small man like me. You are no less, sir. You've earned millions by setting up this theatre. Thank God for that! See after a year. I'll be having 50 million in my cupboard. Why in the cupboard? Why not in the bank? Mr. Rehman, how about you give me an investment idea like this one. I'll definitely tell you but not in our first meeting. Why? Let's get more acquainted and then, I'll surely... But... - But, you've to do something for me. Anything sir. Are you the nephew of the Jagirdar of Belapur? I sure am. - That means, Kishore's brother. That's unfortunate of me. - I need Kishore's address. What are you saying? How can I know where he is? What do you need his address for? - I'll tell you. My actress Nirmala has a friend named Kamini. That scoundrel Kishore has eloped with her. To hell with her! Who is Kamini to you? You are a fool! Nirmala is very upset with Kamini gone. She is not working with dedication. I am facing a heavy loss. Why worry? Kishore is a murderer and the police is looking for him. He'll definitely be caught someday. When will the day come when that scoundrel will be hanged? Please make yourself comfortable. Let's toast to that with a genuine cup of kahwah [green tea]. Some other day. If you don't mind then, can I ask you something? Definitely! How can you speak Hindi so fluently? - That's a very good question. Actually, my mother was an Indian. - I'll take your leave now. Bye! I may be young but not a tell-tale. Consider me your friend. - Definitely! Me and you together can do a lot of things. Good bye! - Good bye! Are you less alone that you need me too? Who is it? Who's inside? Who put the lights on? Kamini, have you come back? Oh! It's you! - Who else could be in your room? Through which door did you come in? - The same door you came in through. Wait a second! That means, you've been coming here before. It's my first time but now I'll keep coming. As I've seen the house. Don't deceive me. I know you've come here before. You've abducted Kamini. And today you are here to take the letter Kamini left by mistake. That's a nice accusation. But, why would I come looking for a letter I never wrote? And, how can I abduct the girl I've never seen? I've nothing to do with Kamini. I haven't killed her father. Believe me, I am innocent. - But, I am not convinced. What? You too are with the world? Fine! I abducted Kamini. I killed her father. Come with me to the police station. I'll confess my guilt and you'll get awarded for my arrest. If the people whom I trusted turned their backs on me then... better than this life is the gallows. Let's go! Please don't take me wrong. I am hearing lots of about you. Everyone thinks you are a murderer, a cheat. I do tend to lose confidence when I hear all this. But, I don't believe that from my heart. If your heart is with me then, I don't care for the lashing tongues. But, I'll have to live in obscurity till the real killer is not found. When will the real killer be found? I'll now have to try to unveil this secret. Why weren't you doing nothing all this while? I thought no one needed me. But now that you are there. Where are you staying? - In a small alley near your theatre. Really? - But, I don't come out in daylight. I come out at night undercover. Nirmala, will you do me a favour? - What? I want to see your drama tomorrow night. No way. What if someone sees you? - Don't you worry about that. Book a seat in the name of Bose. Bye! Farewell till tomorrow night. Mr. Bose, huh! With some pauses and some halts I set forth to the abode of my love With some pauses and some halts I set forth to the abode of my love My eyes with streaks of kohl are filled The swirl of the clouds has my hair My anklets has the melody of music With some pauses and some halts I set forth to the abode of my love With some pauses and some halts I set forth to the abode of my love When the passion for you dwells in my heart When the passion for you dwells in my heart Why then is the dark night cold and misty? My dot shines always brightly I set forth to the abode of my love With some pauses and some halts I set forth to the abode of my love I've caught a glimpse of my lover Now hath my eyes felt much relieved Lights of joy brightens up, warding the nights of gloom Lights of joy brightens up, warding the nights of gloom With some pauses and some halts I set forth to the abode of my love With some pauses and some halts I set forth to the abode of my love That Bengali had to be Kishore. That's why he fled seeing the policeman. Good! I am safe! What's happened to you all of a sudden? I got a shock. Thank God Kishore quietly fled from the police. If he had been caught, all our troubles would be over. Idiot! If Kishore had been caught, the matter would go to court. Quite possibly, the secret would be disclosed. You are scared for no reason. As long as we have got Kamini in our captivity no one can harm you. Why don't we capture Kishore, too? As long as he is free, we can't live in peace. Speak softly! Even walls have ears. You meet the Arab. I'll wait for you in the car. Kamini is in our captivity. As long as Kishore is free, we can't live in peace. What's going on? But, why didn't Kishore tell me about it? Anyways! Never mind! I'll find it from Raj. So, what do you think about business? Shall we crack the deal today? Have Mercy! Are you nuts? You talk such a dangerous thing so openly? No way, man! - What's the problem in talking? You are still quite immature. This is a theatre. I'll come to your place and talk. Hope you don't mind. - You are embarrassing me. Me mind when it's you who's taking the trouble? You will be gracing my abode your presence. Thank you very much! I thought your wife might object. How can there be any objection when I don't have a wife? Have Mercy! Are you still single? Such youth and such patience! Great! I'll be over tomorrow night. - Very well. I'll be waiting. One more thing. Keep in mind one thing. What? - I don't eat grass. I am a non-vegetarian. No need for much formalities. A dozen of chicks, quails and a couple of ducks will be enough. Please do not embarrass your Indian host. You may not know that I have these for breakfast. Good bye! - Good bye to you too! Liar! All your life you ate mung beans from my plate. And now you have chicken for breakfast! Oh Raj, you! We don't meet for ages. And when we do meet, it's twice in a week. Had you come to watch the show? - Not only me. Kishore too had come. So what if he had come. - Sure! Why not? Now he is a murderer. Who will love him now? What did you say? Me and love Kishore! O Raj! Nice excuse to avoid me. - Excuse? Do you still love me even after me dumping you? Why ask me when I am still alive? Ask yourself when I'll die pining for you. Please don't say such thing. I took you to be wrong. But... It's not too late now. I am still single and I need a companion like you. I want you to go on repeating this again and again. But the world will envy. Tell me when can I meet you? Tomorrow... No, day after tomorrow in the Moonlight Club. Do you want me to suffer a day more? You don't know. I am having a guest at home. I've already made a promise. Fine. Then it's day after tomorrow. Today I'm going from here very happy. And day after tomorrow, I'll come there very happy. Is this your home or a hide out? - Didn't you like it? Very much! There couldn't be a better place than this for our business. This room is so sound-proof, our voice can't reach even the cops. Well, what do you think? - Brilliant idea. How about we talk business now? You are still so immature. You want to talk confidential matter in his presence! He looks like a scumbag to me! - Please don't say that. He is my most trusted man. No need to be afraid at all. So, what's your scheme? - You dare to ask me that? It's a gold mine. I swear by my beloved that... by the fortnight next month you'll have a million rupees with you. Did you say a million? - One million. Man, you seem to be a man with a very weak heart. You are astounded just by the mention of a million! Mister, this is nothing. After a year you'll be counted amongst the rich and the famous. It's your kind gesture else, I am not even worth your dirt. Absolutely! - But, what will be the business? The same business... - Which one? No way, Mr. Abdul Rehman. But, there's too much risk involved. You are scared of taking risk! Oh Bellamy! This is Ali Baba's door! Never knew you had a woman in here. Do you have a taste for this too? My my! What a beauty! She is a precious little thing, Mr.Raj! Mr. Raj? His name is not Raj. His name is Kishore. Kishore? Oh no... Oh yes! It's Kishore. Let's go, sir. - Yes, let's go. I'm really surprised. But tell me something. How did Kamini get here? How do you know Kamini? - Nirmala showed me her photo. Besides, her photo is in the papers in regard of her father's murder. Oh! So that's the case. - That is the case. There are no secrets from you. Kamini is my girlfriend. Do you confine a girlfriend? - Why are you suspecting me? I am convinced now that you wrote the letter to Kamini in Kishore's name. You abducted her. You confined her here. Furthermore, you killed her father. Kishore is not the killer, you are! Shut up! - You shut up! I'll blow up your head if you uttered another word. I am a brave man. I am not threatened by death. You do not know that in my times I killed 12 people. You don't say! - I am saying it! Like you, even my name is not Abdul Rehman. But it's Aaram Khan, understood! Now I am so very pleased to meet you. - Likewise! Because, you too are brave like me. Our stories are one. Let's shake hands to that. Let's get back to the business. When do we start? Mr. Raj, we trust no one. Right? - True. We are the Devil's assistant on Earth. Right? True. The Devil has told me that whenever I do business with a new man... I write down and give him one of my secrets... and take the same from him. But, what's the use of that? - It is quite evident. If you ever betray me, I can disclose your secret. And if I ever stab in your back, you can hang me. Well, do you agree? - Okay. Then bring the pen and the paper. Abdul Rehman alias Aaram Khan. AK.A? - Else nothing. Have you penned down the whole story? - Yes, I have. The same murder story? - That's my whole story. I have 12 stories. Here you go! Take it to be a business formality. May God save us from the cops evil eyes. Amen! I'll take your leave now. Boss, what have you done? You wrote your own death warrant! Heera, it was a fair deal. If my life is in his hand then I too have his life in mine. I am not an amateur player. Within 48 hours, that black envelope will be in my possession. What's wrong? Fortune favours such fools! - It's a pity! He is such a buffoon, a bozo and yet he owns a rich estate! Nirmala, you saw what the Creator could not see. Damn me to have dumped a brilliant and beautiful girl like you... for his stubborn mother. Bless you dear who still loves me. Whatever God does is for the best. You dumped me for your mother and changed my life. How is that? Today I learnt that money is greater than a tender heart and a pretty face. Neither would I have learnt this lesson nor had acted in that theatre. Neither would I have earned such fame and fortune. And neither would I have met you again. What? Meet me? What am I? A diamond knows not its worth. A woman loves only once in her life. And you are my first love. Till today men thought women to be imbeciles. But, I am the first man who thinks that Man is an idiot. Till today, I was under an impression that... you must be blinded by that Arab's money and become his girlfriend. Don't cuss my love. Bless my Indian love. Why would I fall for an Arab? Bravo Nirmala! But tell me one thing. What is the truth about that Arab? People say that he's a big fraud. - It's possible. Speak clearly. You are his heroine. That I am. - Don't hide anything from me. What will I hide from you. Besides, he is also your best friend now. That he is. But, you can't keep me in the dark. Who the hell is that Arab? - Very gifted. But, everyone has their own opinion. I think he's an enigma. An enigma? Just last night, he returned quite late and that too stealthily. Stealthily? - Yes. He then went straight into his room and opened the cupboard. How did you know all this? I was in the adjoining room learning my lines. I became alert as soon as I heard the cupboard opening. I peeked inside and... - And what? The Arab was standing before the open cupboard. And do you know what was in there? - What? Bundles of notes, jewellery and documents strewn about. Did you see them with your own eyes? - Of course! Was there a black envelope too? - Well... Oh yes! It was there. What have you got to do with that? - Nothing in particular. Our business agreement is in that black envelope. What business are you both running together? No matter what business it is. Main aim is to make money. Just as you mentioned. - What? That money is greater than a tender heart and a pretty face. And I want to earn that wealth only for you. I don't want that wealth. - Why? You are my wealth. It's too late now. - So what? That Arab is a very suspicious man. He asks odd questions of being late. It's my job. I have to go. Do you really want from your heart to go? I am leaving my heart behind. Slowly and steadily... on the wedding night. That black envelope is in that Arab's cupboard which is in his room. By tomorrow that envelope should be in that possession. You'll have the entire cupboard. - Bravo Heera! Let's go! Bravo Nirmala! Let's go! Found it! Hand me that envelope! - I will but... Giving it or not? - Who are you? I too am a thief like you. - What will you do with this envelope? Hand me that envelope if you know what's best for you. Let's go! Listen friend, the thing is... - Your tricks won't work here. Today is my day, get it! Let's go! What is it? - Friend, we belong to the same club. Thus, don't act so selfish and give me that envelope. Enough! Now, get out! So, my Kishore is not the murderer! The real murderer is Raj! Thank you so much, O Lord! My Kishore is not a murderer. Mr. Abdul Rehman! Thank God! Else all my efforts would have gone to vain. I am so stupid. I completely forgot to lock the cupboard. How long will I have to remain in a disguise? So, you were posing with me! You were so close and yet you remained so far from me. Hello! - Hello! I nearly lost my balance. - Why is that? I thought it was the cops. - Why would they be coming here? I am a Muslim and a Muslim never lies. I suspected that maybe you must have handed my envelope over to the cops. I am a Hindu. And truth is what we Hindus live on. I came to check if you hadn't handed my envelope to the cops. Do you take me to be a pipsqueak to squeal on you? God is the witness. I regard you as an Angel. You are such a man of God! Have a seat now. What about our business? What do I say? The cops are too smart. Don't know how they found out about that machine? Oh my God! What now? My mind's not working. But, there is a way. Don't take the deliver of the machine in Bombay. Rather, have the shipment unloaded on a shore in an unknown place. That's not difficult. Your bring in your ship in my estate in Belapur. Is that near the shore? - Absolutely. And, I'll even ask my uncle to send your theatre an invitation. No one will ever suspect. You are still so immature! Think about it! Will the Jagirdar of Belapur after losing his son want to see the drama? The only son of whom who has turned a fugitive in a murder case... Won't he feel ashamed to entertain? I said that after much thought. You just wait. You'll definitely receive the invitation from my uncle. That's between you and your uncle. But do keep in mind that Belapur is heavily guarded. I know. Shouldn't be that the cops who are looking for Kishore spots me. I might lose my expensive machine and my freedom too. Have faith in me. What am I for? A very big gang of gold smugglers is here in this city. And the leader of the gang hails from a respectable family. I also heard from a reliable source that... he not only deals with gold but girls too. For a long time have I been trying to track down for this gang. I am sure I'll definitely succeed. Welcome sir! Meet my mother. - Hello mother! God bless you! - Hello Abdul Rehman! That's my uncle. What are you doing? - Did I make a mistake? Not exactly. But, you are our guest. We should be honouring you. Mr. Raj, your uncle is insulting my race. You are my friend's uncle. And, I should have the same respect for him as I can have for my father. My friend is a man of such morality. - Undoubtedly he is. Though being a Muslim, you touched my feet as per the Hindu tradition. From now on, you are as much dear to me as my own son Kishore. Did you see that Durga? Humanity still exists. Raj dear! - Yes mom? Arrange for some snacks. - Sure mom. Please have a seat. - Thank you! Forget the festival. We can't even eat without our son. But Raj forced us to celebrate the festival of Dashera. Because, Kishore loved this festival. And who knows? Maybe this festival might unite us with our son. Father, is your son really innocent? What do I say now? Wish you had known my son. Then you would realize that... And known that even a rich man's son can be philanthropic. If there's anyone who's practiced philanthropy in opulence, it's my son. You tell me. How can such a benignant child kill anyone? Mother, do you also think the same? You do not know my nephew. He is one in a million. Raj is my own son. But I tell you... If I find my nephew, I can even sacrifice my son for him. Mother, children are very dear to the parents. The child be either good or bad, he is after all everything to you. You are right. I am not the only one missing my child. Every children here are missing him very much. One neighbour sleeps peacefully the other cries out woefully Did you hear that? This is the same song my Kishore would sing with the children. If there is any truth in your words... then our Gods will definitely unite you with your son. Greetings sire! - Greetings! Please sit down! The night is dark, the path treacherous Heavily guarded by brutal beast How do I reach across the shore... Deep dark ocean lies in the midst How beautiful! How charming! Do I call you a wave or pleasing sight? O beautiful marbled sculptured body washed in moonbeam! Can I ask you who you are? O Man, who belongs to this fake world! I am the Soul of Truth! O Holy Soul of Truth! You belong to the sky. Why then have you come down on Earth and hung upside down? Whenever an innocent blood is shed, injustice is sowed, my heart trembles. Agitated, I come down on Earth to spread the light of Justice. But the deceptive people of this deceptive world... try to victimize me with daggers and swords. O kind man, if you value the truth. If you love the Truth and hate the Lies... will you become my Knight? I swear by your beauty! I swear by your virtue! I will help you! Why has God given Man two hands? Not so that he may dig up the graves of Justice, Nobility and Humanity. But, so that he may come forward and help himself those who are in need. Well spoken! The condition of my world, You must surely be seeing You must surely be seeing... O Creator! After creating this, You must be very sorry You must be very sorry... In ruins lies the Palaces of Truth Flourishing are Abodes of Lies What were You thinking when you decided to make this World What were You thinking when you decided to make this World I am certain in your heart, you must feel ashamed You must feel ashamed... The condition of my world, You must surely be seeing You must surely be seeing... Hatred of this world a Gift is. Love is but a Blame Deceit is the dawn of this world. Reality is the night Deceit is the dawn of this world. Reality is the night Tell me if not on your action, You must be feeling furious You must be feeling furious The condition of my world, You must surely be seeing You must surely be seeing... O negligent man! What have you done? Alas! The world has lost the Ray of Truth! Today, the Darkness of Lies has taken over this world. O Immortal Soul of Truth, we salute you! O Truth! Your mortal body sure has perished from this transitory world. Priests of Deceit and Darkness have shot you down with volleys of arrows. But, just as love cannot remain hidden. The same way, murder too does not go unnoticed. If thy murderous tongue maintains silence Blood stains on hands shall cry for justice O Goddess of Truth, I ask thee one question. Speak! For thy lips are now free. Speak! For thy tongue is still yours. Speak less, time you got plenty before thine body goes limp. Speak! For Truth still lives! Speak! Say what you wish to say. Truth can never be concealed by the phoney principles Sweet fragrance cannot emit from the paper flowers Bravo! O Worshiper of Truth! O Priest of Reality! You are the only man in this world who recognized me. Ask! I shall answer all your questions. O Holy Soul, I know! Just as no one can touch the air. Can't control the rays of the Sun and the Moon... Cannot stop the music of the flowing streams from the mountains. In the same way, none can kill you! O Holy Soul, just tell me in what form did you come into this world? Which statue of clay were you residing in? What was the name of he within whom your soul dwelt? O Good man of God! I am glad that in this world there is such man... who wishes to lift the veil from the darkness. Who by suffering sorrows and pain wants best for God's created Man. O Angel of Earth, today I reveal to you my true name. Gladly! Six months ago, there lived a poor man. Fate had giveth him poverty and purity. He too like you was a man to die for truth. But... But when he tried to find the truth... lie shot him dead. Who was that unfortunate man? - He was a kind father. Who could not succeed in saving his only daughter's honour from shame. But he lost his life. What is his name? - His name? His name was Ronaq Lal! And Ronaq Lal's murderer is present in this crowd. What? I say, stop this drama! Mr. Raj, do not forget that we are your guest. And we are here to stage a play on your invitation. You call this a play? - Then admit that this is the truth. Why hide the name of the murderer? Why need the name when his face is before you? Mr. Raj a murderer! What? My Raj a murderer! Brother! What are you saying? Has Raj murdered Ronaq Lal? Not Ronaq Lal. I've killed the love of this shameless girl. She is the same girl whose proposal mom had rejected. She is here for revenge after being dumped by me. Rest assured, uncle! I'll not let her toy with my family reputation. Mr. Raj, your family honour is much more dearer to me than you. I am not here to lessen but to add more glory to your family honour. Nice way to add glory to it. How dare you accuse my nephew of murder? What proof have you got? - You will get it right now. Master, show him the proof. - I have no proof. How come? You have the written confession of Mr. Raj. Bring it out! Else, I'll do it! Master! Here is that confession. What is that? Brother, what's written in it? Don't you worry, sister. This is a blank paper. Blank paper! - Brother! How dare you fling mud at a respectable man? Spitting at the moon will only make your face dirty. On one side is Nirmala who's turned so vile after having failed in love. And on the other hand is this tart who earns her living in hotels. Now I get it! All this good girl image was to defame my son! You've only heard of a good girl image but never seen it. Behold it now! This is the real confession! Brother, look what's written in it. Sister, this is the confession in Raj's handwriting. What's written? Raj has confessed that he is the murderer of Ronaq Lal and not Kishore. Think about it! Can a murderer ever give a written confession of his crime? But Raj, it's in your handwriting. It has your initials. What's the mystery? - There is no mystery. If I had killed Ronaq Lal... would I've invited these players to send me to the gallows. You are right! Wish my brother Kishore had been here today. He would have told you that these people have conspired against me. Kishore! Come from anywhere and save my honour! Come Kishore come! Your brother's life is in danger. How very strange of you! Where is Kishore to hear your plea and come here? If there's any truth in my call, then he'll come from wherever he is. Mr. Raj, he is coming! Kishore is coming! You have gone insane. Where is Kishore? Master, do you too wish to see him? Then, behold the miracle! Behold yonder! Hey, what is this nonsense? - No nonsense. It only makes sense. Nirmala! - Yes master! Mr. Kishore! Kishore, my son! - Kishore... Brother, you still got time to make a run for it! My son! First at least meet me. You've tortured me a lot. Did you feel no pity at my old age? Why did you have to run when you were innocent? Dad, the circumstances were such. Brother Raj had... No... I can't force myself to say it. Bombay Police has issued a warrant in your name... for smuggling gold into this country and for holding these two as hostages. Stand right there else... - Else what? Else, I'll be forced to shoot you. Then go ahead and shoot. Shut up! Raj, like cowards, don't use Nirmala as a shield. Come forward if you are a real man! Does that mean my mother too wants to push me into the jaws of death? It's too late now. Hand over yourself to the law! Take a step towards me and I'll blow her head off! Before that happens, I'll smear my hands with your blood. Where the world has seen the love of a mother, let them witness her patience too. - Aunt! Surround the stage. See that the culprit and his men don't make a getaway. Hurry! How well have you paid back your dues to your mother. If you want to kill me, go ahead and shoot! If I had died, you were to light my pyre. Go ahead and shoot! What are you looking at? Shoot! Boss, the situation is highly sensitive. Fall for your mother's tears and you might lose your life. Shut up you wretched cur! - How dare you, old woman! No... Raj, if only you had waited for just 2 more months... I... A mother! O God! How did I ever birth to a beast? He has insulted my motherhood, my bloodline, my forefathers! Inspector, I have but one request to make to you! When it will be time for this fiend to be hanged... give me the opportunity to put the noose around his neck. So that the world may witness... that when a mother can give birth to a bad son... she can also send him into the arms of death. Murder! Brother! Kishore, do not insult our pious relation by calling me your brother. Raju! - Uncle! Mother! I'd have definitely touched your feet before leaving. But, I do not wish to touch your feet with these blood smeared hands. I killed your father. And you sacrificed your life in order to save my mother! Such a beautiful vengeance! Let's go, Inspector! Aunt! Do not condole me. I've no regrets Brother, did I not tell you that this time too... the festival of Dashera would bring glad tidings for us? What's festive about it? One eye opened and the other closed. That one eye is enough which has the love for Man and fear of God. Won't go in vain. I shall erect a grand Temple of Humanity on your tomb. Nirmala, my child! I rejected you for your poverty. Good thing you broke my pride. Man becomes great not by wealth but by his actions. Take this, my dear! At last the darkness lost and the light triumphed. Look over there! The new day brings the message of new hope. They who hold on to Hope do reach their destination someday. Subtitles by Nine99
