Oh, hey. Excuse me. I’m looking for 9 Doran Lane? Hi, sweetie. It’s Mommy. Are you having fun with Katy? Whoa, cool. Well, that sounds awesome. You can show me when I get home, okay? Well, Mommy’s at work. No, I know. I’m going to be there at 3:30 to pick you up, okay? Okay, I gotta go. Oh, my God. My lucky day. Hey, there. Can I help you? It’s not what it looks like, I promise. It looks like you’re trying to steal my truck. Okay, it is what it looks like, but it’s not what you think, I promise. Uh-huh, yeah. Why don’t you come on out of there, and you can tell the cops all about it, okay? Please, I’m just trying to get home. Get home? Well, you could call a cab. Hop a bus. Grand theft auto, probably not your best bet. No, wait. Please, please. Look, something happened. I was on a job, and an accident happened. I couldn’t get paid and so I can’t get home. And I’m just trying to make it home to my little boy. Please. Well, what’s so urgent you need my truck? I left it with the sitter when I was at work, and I’m five hours late, and I can’t contact her. I’m really worried. Please. You’re not drunk or something, are you? No. I don’t drink. So, you just need to get home? Where do you live? Westborough. Give me the keys. Give me the keys. Push over. I’m driving. Are you serious? Yes, I’m serious, but hurry up before I change my mind. Go. Let’s get you home. I’m Billy. Um, thanks. I’m Annie. I hate to ask this, but is it okay if I borrow your phone? Yeah, go ahead. Thank you so much. I really don’t know how to thank you for this. It’s all good. Just paying it forward. Maybe one of these nights it’s gonna be me out trying to steal your truck out of your driveway, and you’ll... you’ll do the same for me. Hi, Katy. It’s me, Annie. I know that it’s almost 9:00 and I’m so sorry because I said I’d be home hours ago. Just... something came up and I couldn’t get to a phone. Just please tell Tate I’m going to be home soon, and I’ll pay you extra for your time. I’m so sorry about all this, and I really hope that everything’s okay. Okay, bye. No news? Babysitter’s not answering. Lot of cops out tonight. Yeah. Full moon, I guess. Tate. That’s your son’s name? Yeah. He’s eight. Eight’s a good age. He can ride a bike, he can climb a tree, but he still don’t mind a good tickle, right? Do you have kids? Nah. No. I had a little brother once, though. I thought you said your name was Billy. Yeah. Friends call me Billy, and the occasional thief I find out in my driveway at night. Something’s not right. What are you doing? I want to make sure everything’s okay. Oh, no. No, you don’t have to do that. It’s okay. Look, I’m here now. Let’s just make sure it’s alright. Katy? Tate? Tate! They should be here. They’re not here. Yeah, this is Billy. Yeah, she is. It’s for you. Hello? Hi, Mrs. Wilkerson. It’s Katy. I just got your message. Katy, yes. Hi. Thank goodness you’re alright. Where are you? Where’s Tate? Tate? What do you mean? Is he not at your mother-in-law’s? My moth... Why would he be with my mother-in-law? Well, when you weren’t picking up your phone for, like, three hours, I called the emergency contact number you gave me. Oh, right. The emergency contact. I completely forgot that I did that. Of course you would have called Elizabeth. Katy, I’m so sorry for the confusion. I-I... I got so distracted with work. Is everything okay, Mrs. Wilkerson? I didn’t do anything wrong, did I? No, no, no. You didn’t do anything wrong, and everything’s fine, it’s just been a really long night. Okay, um, I should probably get back to studying then. Just let me know when you’ll need me again. Of course. Thank you, Katy. He’s at my ex-mother-in-law’s. I’m just going to call. Yeah, go ahead. Hi, Elizabeth, it’s Annie. I’m so sorry that I’m calling so late I, uh... I lost my phone, and if you can, just give me a call back on this number when you can. Thanks. Bye. Um... Thank you. You keep it. I think you need it more than I do. You can send it to my house when you get a new one. Uh, which is where I should probably go now. So... Hey, uh, can I offer you something for the road? Cup of coffee or let me pay for your gas at least. Stop, come on. It’s all good. If I go now I can catch the end of the game. No harm, alright? Just take care of yourself. Hey, uh, I don’t know why you’re being so nice to me, I mean, especially since how we met. Thank you. Well, um... I don’t know, sometimes we do crazy things because we don’t have a choice, right? Yeah. And if I’m being totally honest with you... you didn’t strike me as the carjacking type. I’m going to go. It was, uh, it was really nice to meet you, and I hope everything’s okay. If you ever need me, you know how to find me, right? - Okay. - Thank you. - Bye, Billy. - Bye. Annie! Where have you been? I’ve been so worried. When I got that frantic call from the babysitter, I just assumed the worst. Are you okay? Yeah, I’m fine. Where’s Tate? I put him to bed an hour ago. Annie. Annie! Are you sure you’re telling me the truth? What do you mean? Well, this coming Monday, the 22nd, is the anniversary of Gerald’s passing. Right, right. And I know it hasn’t been an easy three years for you. For any of us. Yeah, you’re right. It hasn’t. Thank you. I don’t know where I’d be without you. I stood by you, Annie, because Tate needed a mother, but you needed a friend. Thank you for watching him. I’m going to get him. You gotta stop spoiling him like this. I’m sorry. I can’t say not to him. Hey. Hey, sleepyhead. Wake up. Hey. Mommy. It’s me. I’m sorry for the misunderstanding. It was my pleasure. You know Tate’s welcome here any time. The both of you are. Thank you. Yeah. Text me when you’re home safe, hm? I will. Let’s go. Come on. Come on. Are you okay? Yeah. Sorry, sweetie. Mommy just had a bad dream. Um... I’m going to go and make some breakfast. - Okay. - Okay? Jut keep playing. Wow, that’s a lot of pancakes. Chocolate chip and blueberry. My favorite. I know. So, how’re you doing today, sweetie? Good. I’m sorry that I confused you yesterday. You must have wondered where I was. Grandma said that you were busy working. Well, that’s true. What? I was requested by name? Aren’t you having any pancakes, Mom? I’m okay, sweetie. I’m not hungry right now. But you eat up. - Katy. Thank you for coming. - Hi. Of course, Mrs. Wilkerson. I just feel so awful about what happened last night. It was not your fault. It was a misunderstanding, okay? Look, you’re okay to watch him for a few hours? What I have to do shouldn’t take too long. I did get a new phone, okay? So, please text me if anything happens or if you need to go anywhere, okay? I’m going to text you the number. Of course, Mrs. Wilkerson. I’m not gonna let you down. Alright. Tate and I are gonna have a great day. And please help yourself to the pancakes, okay? - Okay. - Okay, buddy. Okay. Be good, okay? Bye, Mom. Bye. Okay. - Bye. See ya. - Have a good day, guys. Thank you. Ms. Mosley’s body was found by police officers responding to an anonymous call. The cause of death was a knife wound to the chest. The police are still searching for a suspect, and are not releasing more details at this time. Can you turn off the radio? Thanks. - Hank. - Annie. Pl... Please, come in. I’m so sorry to barge in on you like this. I just didn’t know where else to turn. No, no, no. I’m in trouble. Okay, okay. Have a seat. Tell me, tell me exactly what’s going on. Okay, so you know that I am working for this cleaning service. Yeah. Last night I blacked out or I was drugged, I don’t know, but I woke up with blood all over my hands. The head juror from my trial, Lydia Mosley, she’s dead. What? I didn’t know it was her house, okay? She wasn’t there when I arrived. There was a note on the door telling me to come in, there was a bloody knife in the dishwasher. I found it. Okay, um... Annie, we, uh... We need to contact the police immediately. No, they’re going to think that I did it, okay? They’re going to think I killed her, Hank, for revenge. Annie. By leaving that house, your options have narrowed with every step. You’ve incriminated yourself. I didn’t have a choice. They’re not going to believe me. Listen to me, okay? You need to trust in the system. Let me help you. The system that locked me away for something I didn’t do? Look, I can’t do that. I can’t let them take him from me again. I need to know who is trying to set me up. What can I do to help? I just need to figure out what they know in the investigation with Lydia. Can you call your friends? Please. Please. Let me make a few calls. Thank you. Her death is being investigated as a murder. There was an anonymous phone call made to the police. Um, forensics are still at the house. So... It’s only a matter of time, Annie. A few days at most. Even if they don’t find a fingerprint or a DNA sample, they’re going to check her phone records, see who she hired. They’ll know you were there. Okay, then I need to figure out who’s trying to set me up before the police do. I mean, whoever did this, they could have killed me. They could have made me disappear. No, they wanted to see me behind bars. Or, whoever did this wanted Lydia Mosley dead, and you were simply caught in the crossfire. I don’t believe that. I need to figure this out. Thank you. I’ll be in touch. Annie. Hey! Hey! Hey, stop! Stop! Why are you following me!? Stop! Hey! - Hi. - Hey. Annie, I didn’t expect to see you. So soon? Uh, more like again. I brought you your phone back, and also something just to say thank you for what you did. Um, it’s for your steering wheel. For intruders. Yeah. It’s a gift. Yeah, well, now that you mention it, I have been rethinking my spare key policy. Do you want to come in? Yeah, that’d be good. Thanks. Yeah, sorry about the mess. Oh, it’s okay. Um... So, um, what do you do for a living, Billy? You said construction, right? Yeah, you know, um... Odd jobs. This and that. Um, why don’t you tell me why you’re really here, huh? Look, I did want to thank you for yesterday. It’s been a long time since someone’s been nice to me. But you’re right. I am here because I need your help. Okay. I think that somebody is following me. You can’t go to the cops? This related to the accident that happened yesterday. Right. I was in prison. For almost three years. I just got out not long ago. My parole had two conditions, okay? Get a job and stay out of trouble, and yesterday I messed up both of them. So you came here. I managed to get a picture of the license plate of the car who I think has been following me, and I thought that maybe you might know a guy that could help me run it. So, you’re saying I kind of look like a guy who knows a guy? Your tattoo. I saw something similar when I was on the inside. Alright. Well, you’re not wrong. In my line of work... you need to look up a few IDs, so to speak. Know who you’re really dealing with. Now, I downloaded this software from a very charming fellow on a message board that shall remain nameless. What about me? Did you look me up? Maybe. And what did you find? I found a sad story about a car crash from a few years back. The rest is none of my business. So, you don’t care? No, I care. Believe me, I care. My, um... My mom, she... Let’s just say that I know something about being a single mom with a record and raising a son. Or two. I just really appreciate what you’re going through. And I want to help you. I really do, okay? Let me see that picture again. Huh. Gun-metal grey Audi. Let me try something. Yeah. Here we go. Maynard Barnes. AKA Jack Manson. AKA Peter Budd. He’s a career criminal. I mean, why would someone like him want to follow me? You tell me. No, I kept my nose clean in prison, and I’ve kept myself ever since. This guy, he drives around in a car with his own license plate. Okay, so maybe he just thought you were an easy mark. He thought he wouldn’t have to worry about you. Still, I don’t think he’s the sharpest tool in the shed, you know? Somebody has to be paying him. He’s probably not the one pulling the strings. I’m going to find out who. Let’s go. No, you don’t have to come. Honestly, you’ve done enough, Billy. No, no. I’m not arguing this. I’m not arguing this, okay? That being said though, this guy Maynard is pretty far out there. So, I’d appreciate if you could fill up my tank with gas, and, uh, then I’ll take you out there. I’m kidding. Hey, anything? Are you sure this is the place? Yeah, this is it. I’m sure. Hey, alright. Come on, let’s go. Okay. How do you want to play this? I don’t know. Well, this is what we do. We sit, and we wait, and we watch. We’re going to get the lay of the land. I mean, he could be alone. He could have a retired SWAT team in there for all we know. Hey, can I, uh... Can I ask you about your accident? What happened? We were... driving home after a party. Gerald, he’d... he’d had a bit too much to drink. He was being playful and he was trying to kiss me. I took my eyes off the road for just a second, but... when I looked back there were headlights coming right at us. The next thing I remember... was a police officer shining a light in my eyes and asking me questions... While I watched my husband being wheeled away. They sentenced me to three and a half years for driving under the influence. Although, I didn’t have any drinks that night. I don’t remember the last time I had a drink. But... I think I blamed myself, and everything happened really fast. Tate when to stay with his grandma, and I got out after two and a half. Two and a half years... Of my life was stolen from me. Two and a half years without my son. Annie, I’m so sorry. I need to clear my name. I don’t have any more time to waste. I need to go in. Open the door. Thanks. Hey. Someone’s paying this guy a boatload of money. Like, 40 grand this month. Billy. They’re leaving again. We’ve come this far. Let’s go see where they’re going. So... We just keep following ’em? He... It’s mostly just junk mail. Oh, my God. What is it? The man who lives here, his name is Samuel Primm. Who’s Samuel Primm? The night of my accident, the guy driving the other car, that was his name. Annie, that is one hell of a coincidence. I mean, is he behind all this? Why? Maybe you can ask him yourself. He looks older than I remember. Okay, well, what do you want to do now? I don’t... I don’t know. I’ll go in first. No! What are we going to do? Tie him up? Force a confession from him? Yeah, maybe. If that’s what it takes... - No, we can’t do that! - Annie, listen to me. If this guy is involved with someone like Maynard Barnes, we cannot be messing around with him, okay? I mean, maybe there’s another way. Yeah? Like what? I’m going to go and talk to him. I mean, I don’t have time to be careful anymore. An... Think they bought it? Yes, can I help you? Samuel Primm? Yeah? Do I know you? Annie Wilkerson. You’re here. Were you expecting me? Please. Come inside. I heard that you were badly injured in the crash. Spine mostly. All that time in court sitting across from each other. I don’t think we ever spoke. Legally, I suppose we weren’t allowed to. I remember that you couldn’t look at me. I think about that night all the time. As do I. I came to ask you... I came to ask you... why you’re trying to destroy my life. And to beg you to stop. Is it about revenge? Revenge? I don’t know what you’re talking about. No, I saw you with my own eyes. You’re paying them. The men that are following me and trying to set me up. Why? What men? Annie, what... What... What happened to you was an injustice. If you... If you came here coming to-to find the conspiracy, you came here for nothing. I harbor nothing but remorse. What? The a... The accident was all my fault. I was texting and... And driving, and... I veered out of my lane. Why would the police officer lie? He was protecting me. He was a friend of mine. We grew up together. He changed the results of your blood test. The investigating officer... where is he now? He... He died almost two years ago. Had cancer. Okay, so those men, they weren’t here for you. I live here on my own with... my cows. I don’t see anyone. I don’t speak to anyone. Okay. So, then what were they doing here? I mean, who could they be working for? I... Please. Excuse me. I have to take one of my pills. This has been... been a lot. Annie? I’m sorry. I’m really sorry. What did that guy say to you? He said that I was wrongfully imprisoned. And that they took my son. For nothing. Um... I’m gonna get something to drink and some ibuprofen. Do you need anything else? ’Kay. Here’s some water. There’s the, uh, those... What is this? Yeah, you know, I... I told you. I... I check up on people I’m working with. Oh, so that’s what we’re doing now? We’re working together? You’re looking into my mother-in-law. Her business dealings, her financial holdings. Is that why you’re actually helping me out? Just to get access to her wealth? Or is it something worse? Are you part of what’s happening here? Annie, come on. I... We met by accident. Tell me the truth. You found me, remember? Am I just some mark to you? Look, maybe I considered that there may be some reward somewhere down the road, maybe, okay? But, you know, what’s the big deal? The truth is, now that I’ve gotten to know you and spent time with you, I realize that I really just like being with you. I don’t believe you. Okay, well. Well, what about you? I saw the news. Lydia Mosley. Local woman found dead. Murderer on the loose. Is that just a coincidence? What were you running from, hm? The night I met you. I did nothing wrong. Nothing. Annie. Annie! Wait! Katy? Tate? Tate! That was fun. Mrs. Wilkerson, you’re back. - Yeah. - Everything okay? Tate wanted to play catch, so we just went to the park. We ran two whole blocks on the way back! Wow. Oh, my God. I’m just so glad you guys are okay. Mom, you’re squeezing me! Sorry, buddy. Okay, you’re going to go and pack some stuff, ’cause we’re going to go to Grandma’s, okay? Go, go. Thank you, again, for staying so long, Katy. No worries. We had an awesome day. Oh, I’m glad. Okay, um... - You okay to get home? - Yeah, sure. - Great. - I’ll see you next week? - Yes. - Okay. - Thank you so much. - Bye, Tate! Bye. Okay. Bye, Katy. See ya. Now. Are you going to finally tell me what’s going on with you, or do I have to hire myself a private detective? I think I’m in trouble, Liz. Someone’s trying to set me up. Put me back in prison. Set you up? What? Why? How? Well, at first I thought it had something to do with the accident, but I think it’s actually linked to something much bigger. Okay, I met with Samuel Primm, and he told me what happened the night of the accident, the truth. What truth? The night of the accident, the night that Gerald died. He admitted that it was his fault. He was texting and driving. You’re saying that the officer on duty that night lied under oath? Yes, to protect the other driver. To protect Samuel Primm. They were childhood friends. We have to call the police! No! To make sure you’re exonerated! No, no. Trust me, okay? Just, we can’t do that right now. You could phone Hank. I mean, surely he’s in a position to help. At least give you some advice. I’m just not sure who I can trust right now. You can trust me, Annie. I’d never do anything to hurt Tate. I know. I know that. The last couple days have just been a nightmare. You poor thing. Let me get you a nice cup of tea. I’ll be right back. What’s wrong? It was you. Yes. Yes. I did it for Tate. He had a choice. Stay with the woman who took him in and who had the means to give him everything his heart could desire, or go with the woman who abandoned him and whose dark past will forever shadow his bright future. A felon for a mother. A father he’ll never know. You were supposed to be arrested that night at Lydia’s, but no, no, you had to wake up, you had to run. I should have used a stronger dose. Why? Why? Because... Tate needs to be with the person who can care for him best. And because I need a purpose again. Tate and I were happy for two and a half years. He was my perfect little companion. And then you get out, and they rip him away from me like he was a loner, like I hadn’t given him my whole heart. You have no idea what it’s like to lose a son, do you? You can’t. You can’t. Because Tate is still alive. You are not going to take him from me. Let him go. What? Like you did that night? Let everything go? Your entire family? You know the accident wasn’t my fault. I was innocent. Innocent? The only person in this house who deserves that term is playing down the hall without a care in the world, and I will do everything in my power to protect that innocence. You don’t have to do a thing, Annie. I’m going to take care of everything. You just go to sleep. Where’s my son? Where’s Tate? Tate’s safe and sound in bed. Let’s just leave him in peace. What are you doing? Two and a half years I took care of that boy. And what do I get in return? Saturday mornings in the park. Listen, I tried to remove you as gently, as considerately as possible, with the least amount of harm to all involved, but you forced my hand. So, they’ve been working for you this entire time? Yeah. They were recommended by our friend, Hank Darrow. He represented Maynard here in a racketeering case. As discreet as he is ruthless. I am sorry, Annie. I tried so hard to make this painless. She can’t be found. I don’t want her to suffer. Just smother her. That seems to me the most merciful. See the size of that house? Yeah. There had to be a hundred grand worth of art just sitting in the living room. Yeah, well, the old lady’s got bank. I knew she had money. I just didn’t know that much. Sort of makes you think, though, don’t it? About what? Well... The cost of good labor these days. The price of doing business. What are you saying? I’m saying once we ditch this chick, we go back to the house and get the kid. Find out how deep the old lady’s pockets really are, then we get out of town before the whole thing blows up. Like a ransom? Well, call it a performance bonus. What if she doesn’t play along? Well, then I’ll play her a copy of our diciest conversations. Remind her who she’s been spilling her secrets to this whole time and who’s been taking notes. Get ’er! What the hell? Go get her. Don’t look at me, I’m not getting in there. Well, one of us has to. Not me. We’re not getting paid enough for that. You’re right. Let’s just tell the old lady the woman’s dead. Let’s go get our money. Tate? Are you really asleep? Or are you playing games with your Grandma? Wh... Looking for somebody? Oh, my God. You scared me half to death. What are you doing back here? Here’s what’s going to happen next. Marcus and I are going to take the kid. We’re going to text you an address in a bit. While you’re waiting, I want you to fill a bag with 200 grand in cash. Make me wait, miss a buck or two, involve the cops, and you’ll never see him again. Then all your little secrets will spill. She can’t be found. I don’t want her to suffer. Just smother her. That seems to me the most merciful. Stop! Stop! Please! Stop. - Hey. - Can I help you? I’m Billy. I’m Annie’s friend. You’re Elizabeth right? We haven’t officially met yet. Annie’s friend? Yeah. Yeah, I’ve been trying to get a hold of her, she’s not answering her phone, and she mentioned she might be stopping by here. Um, so I came to apologize. Oh, isn’t that sweet. I’m sure she’ll be touched, but I’m afraid she’s not here right now. Oh, she didn’t, uh... She didn’t stop by with her son? She’s not in here? Mm, I’m... I’m fairly certain I would have noticed. Right. Um, there’s nothing wrong, is there? I mean, she’s not in any trouble? She’s just been acting very strange these past days. Um... Yeah, you know, I think she’d just want to explain that herself. Well, can I relay a message to her? I’m actually on my way out to see her. Oh, you are? Where is she? Uh, well, I have the address, but, um... I’m not sure I should be telling you this, but she’s afraid that Tate isn’t safe here. She thinks someone’s following her, and she’s absolutely adamant, she’s worked herself up. So, I don’t want to fan the flames. Well, um... I’ve got my truck, so if you’re going to see her, I could just give you a lift. Well, I know she’d want me to be very discreet about this, so. Elizabeth, you gotta help me out here. I, um... I really let Annie down today, and I’m just trying to make it right, you know? Well, I’ve always trusted her judgement in matters like this, so, um, yes. Let’s go and see that daughter-in-law of mine. Okay. Just give me a second, hm? Yeah, yeah. I was just about to come and get you. Annie, what are you doing here? Wait, I... What happened to you? Are you wearing my clothes? Did you know that Elizabeth wanted Tate? I have no idea what you’re talking about. Has something happened to Tate? You tell me. I mean, I tried to beat her thugs back to her place, but they had already taken him. Why didn’t you tell me you were working for her? She commissioned my services over a year ago. My hands were tied. It’s just business, Annie. Did you know that Samuel Primm and the officer who arrested me were childhood friends? So, this entire time you were just pretending to help me. You should know, Annie... the police found a match to the fingerprints they found at Lydia Mosley’s house. You are already in the system. So, they know I was there. You need to think this through very carefully. Think about what’s best for Tate. Now, I can take you to the station myself, make sure things go smoothly when you turn yourself in. I have no intention of turning myself in. Annie. This has gone too far. Yeah? For too long. I could spend the next three months under house arrest for what I’ve already done to help you. Now, I’m calling the police. Tell me where they went. I have no clue, I swear. What about a cabin? I know the man likes to hunt. Tell me. Right now. Okay, he... He has a mortgage on a second property on County Road Six. There’s some hunting cabins in that area. I had no idea this was going to happen, I swear. Elizabeth was just worried about you. She was worried about your capacity to look after Tate. That’s all. So, what happens now? You going to keep digging this trench you’re in? Oh. If I were you, I would lock the door behind me, and I would take a good, long, hard look in the mirror, because that trench you just mentioned, you’re in it just as much as I am. Um, I brought a couple water bottles for the road. Oh. Oh, thanks. Um... Yeah, I’m good. She’s got the cash. Money’s on the way. Is he still sleeping? Yeah. Think we gave him too much of that stuff? As long as he’s still breathing. How do we know she’s going to keep her word? What if she decides to call the cops or something? She won’t call the cops. We got way too much dirt on her. We’re holding all the cards. So, what are we going to do with him then? After. I don’t know. Maybe I’ll adopt. I don’t understand. What’s Annie doing out here? That’s a question you’ll have to ask her yourself. - Hey. - Oh. - Can I help you? - Thank you. No, I’m good. Thank you. - You sure? - Yeah, yeah. Alright, well, just careful there. - Yeah. - Okay. Sorry, Billy. Annie isn’t here. You should have drank the water. This would have been a lot less painful. You got it? Yeah. Come on in. Tate! Let’s see what you brought us first. How’d you get the money so fast anyway? I have a safe. Emergency funds. Just please let me take back Tate. Count it. What’s going on? Look who decided to join us. Did you enjoy your cold swim? In the seat. Perfect. Looking for this? Tate. Hey! No! No! No! Annie. Billy? I don’t know what you’re doing here, but I’m glad to see you. Billy! Come on! I trusted her. I’m so stupid. No, Annie. Annie, I screwed up today. I never should have let you go off on your own. I just had no idea what you’d be walking into. Wait, how did you find me? I was coming to apologize. And then I ran into your mother-in-law, she told me that I could find you out here. Annie, we’re going to get your boy back. Not too far to go. Just a few more hours, and then we’ll stop for the night, okay? We have so much to look forward to, sweetheart. This is our adventure, just you and me. Oh, we’re going to have so much fun. No... No, no, no, no, no. I can’t believe I did that. How could I be so stupid? Oh, God. Grandma? - You’re early. - Don’t you worry, honey. Mommy’s just going to take you on a little trip. You’re not my mother, you’re Grandma. Uh, look, honey. We’re going to have to get out and walk for a while. Why? Well, because this isn’t safe, and I don’t want anything to happen to you. So, we can’t stay here. Why can’t we stay in the truck? Because I love you so, so much. I love you so much. And whatever happens, I want you always to remember that, right? Grandma loves you so much. Here, dear. There we go. Oh, uh... oh... Oh, my... He’s not here. Over there. Over there! Grandma? Tate! No! Was it so wrong to want to give I’m everything? ’Cause you want him happy. To have it all. Just stay here. So, what now? Call the cops? Try to clear your name? She can’t be found. I don’t want her to suffer. Just smother her. That seems to be the most merciful. I think I’m going to lay low for a little while. Let the truth work itself out. Lay low, huh? Sounds like a vacation. Yeah. Vacation sounds like a really good idea to me. I could use one of those right about now. Yeah? Yeah. I don’t suppose you, uh, could use a little company? Hold that thought. There’s just one thing I gotta do first. You know? You said you wanted to give him everything. But you tried to take away his own mother. You never thought I was good enough. Not for Gerald, not for Tate, but I am, and I am never going to let anything happen to him. Noted philanthropist Elizabeth Hale was found guilty, along with her co-conspirators Hank Darrow, Maynard Barnes, and Marcus Fain of first degree murder, and the attempted abduction of her eight-year-old grandson. The truth worked itself out. Yeah. I mean, once the police actually started looking into everything, there was more than enough evidence. So... Yeah. I’m just glad it’s over. I could get used to this. Come here. Oh, you think she’s going to steal your truck? I don’t know. She’s kinda cute, though. If she manages to get in I’ll offer to give her a lift. - Yeah? - Yeah. You gonna go wave your crowbar at her? Give her some of your famous advice? "Hey, call a cab. Hop a bus. Grand theft auto, probably not your best bet." That was a good line. It worked on you. We’ll see. Yeah, we’ll see. He looks mad.
