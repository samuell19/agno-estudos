Madam, didn't the fact that your son played girls' games make you think something was wrong? Yes and no. In fact, to be honest, he was quite sweet as a kid and I saw he was attached to me, and I didn't tend to buy him guns or rifles, no weapons. Back then I thought that he was a peaceful child, a calm kid. It was when he was in fifth year at elementary school, when I saw him taking my clothes and putting them on. So I shouted at him, and I took him to the health centre to have him seen by Dr Levi. She said to me: "Unfortunately you'll have a terrible life, if you lived in an aristocratic environment, you wouldn't be burdened by this. Instead, in the working class environment you live in, you will always be burdened by it... In my opinion, the heterosexual world has been... merciless. It has been excessively harsh. Excessively... sexist. The heterosexual world has a lot to blame itself for. Especially high up, in politics, especially... in culture. Of course, there is a gay culture, a high level of culture, but it doesn't fight to make itself known. It should fight harder, create conflicts and even wars. There should be a war between cultures. HAPPY TO BE DIFFERENT The idea of talking, of telling your father or your mother: "Look, I'm homosexual" was unthinkable. I never told my father. I told my mother, but when I was much, much older. But my mother, like all mothers, had already realised. When I got home late. I'd be quiet so that they wouldn't hear me and often, they'd be talking about me. My mother defended me and my father wouldn't only oppose me, but he'd humiliate me too. He'd say: "You defend him because he's like you, because he has a female mentality which is similar to yours, not mine". If "homosexual" is something that is hard to say nowadays, during the Fascist era, it was inconceivable! That word basically didn't exist, because that thing wasn't allowed to exist in Italy. So it was denied. Mussolini worked a lot on that. He had statues built that celebrated the male body... scoring a homegoal. In my opinion... this is an idea of mine: where there's a man, there's a homosexual too. In the competitive spirit, in strict discipline, in the cult of duty which led many companions of theirs to fight and die like heroes, the athletes of Mussolini's Forum are born. They constantly look to their mission of tomorrow: to be strong in order to be strong educators. At school, Mussolini gave us castor oil, so that we'd be stronger when we grew up. And to the poor he'd give a quince jelly sandwich. You know what Mussolini said? "A tree which bears no fruit must be destroyed!" For us others... who weren't going to have children! "A tree which bears no fruit must be destroyed!" And he sent everyone to the island. I wasn't born then. But a man I knew, called Cordero, told me about Favignana! The islands of Favignana and of Ustica! I remember, you see? They were free to walk about the town, they worked. The one who was a barber worked as a barber, then at night he'd return to jail. "I want to be a dancer". "A dancer, you? That's a woman's profession. Go work the land I", he'd say. I said: "Dad, I like music, why should I...“ He'd say: "No, no, no." And I danced here, in Via Roma, and people gave me money. I've got a photo. And Franco Franchi was there too. Franco Franchi would get on one knee and invite me to twirl around him. I danced the bolero, at the end, he'd run to the back and... Franchi played in restaurants with his comb, he aped the monkey... The owner could see that I was in trouble, because they mistook me for a woman. They were air force officers... And they handed me a note. So he said: "No, no, the young lady doesn't understand, there's no point talking to her." And they walked off. On the note it said: "Can I meet you tonight 7". Beach bum... FAGGOT'S MANUAL how they live, who they frequent, how they seduce etc etc... THE INVERTS I... I walk on the other side... Night without heating. Take note of the thick wool ribbed jersey suit, all hemstitched. - Is it really hemstitched? - I'll stitch you up! How rude... Fascism sent many of them to work in Carbonia... less coal, miners who were more tired... Nowadays, at the end of the day, they have an easier life. Odd? Grotesque? Repulsive? One thing is true: their mincing moves hide the tragic reality of picking-up, by that I mean male prostitution. They go in pairs, like two fried eggs in a pan, along with their assistants the fag-hags... For you we penetrated the jungle of the gentle, the one that in the afternoon is just a garden of nannies. Capturing this degrading scene wasn't easy, in the romantic setting of Villa Borghese. The whispered conclusion of a contract. It felt like we were filming strange antelopes, sensitive to the slightest sign of a stranger's presence, ready to disappear, to hide. The antelopes of the inverted vice and a custom built rhino. The pink gazelles, like vampires, don't like sunlight. Daybreak starts to make them nervous, dawn scares them, but the trap of cinematic vanity worked this time too. We interview them in rhyming couplets. "Why do you wander here and there as the dawn makes the city fair?" - Well, we wander round... - Is wandering around forbidden? Young hustlers, why does the night make you feel so high? - We like nightlife. - Why? Because you see things you don't see during the day. And for people too, it's better that we're out at night. Plus, with all these foreigners that come to Rome, surely they bring all this depravation. Well, yes, it's like Asian flu, it comes from abroad. The other mistake, was made by Minister Merlin... closing all the brothels! - The police! - Run! These would be two great sprinters if there were an Olympics for inverts. - Don't beep, they might be resting. - Big deal! The countryside's fabulous! I'd spend my whole life here. - Master Roberto! - Broadbent, how are you? How nice to see you! How are you? - Fine! - I'm glad. - This is Broadbent. - What a lovely surprise for my uncle. I'll tell them right away. They'll be ecstatic. Excuse me. Madam Enrica! Mr Michele! Broadbent! Goodness knows how many times he's held me. Plenty, I bet! I'd never seen a fag from the countryside. - What do you mean? - Didn't you know? It's obvious. Why d'you think they call him Broadbent? - It's a nickname. - No! Broadbent... he's bent. It's obvious. Oh, Jesus Christ! Blessed Christ. Help us. And free us all from evil. Jesus, help me! It was a quiet place, there were brothels. I worked there, as a young man. They sent me to get condoms... can I say that? Condoms, water to rinse their mouths and teeth with, and they gave me fifty cents. I was a cute boy then, I was very handsome, with bright eyes, my eyes were sparkling. I had blue eyes, like my father. He was a handsome man, tall, lean, fair hair. I got my mother's hair, dark brown. My father, when he found out about the condition I was in, threw me out of the house. My mother looked everywhere for me. My father kept me... God rest his soul... for two days and two nights, tied up on a horse, in the stable. We're butchers, by profession, the whole clan, my relatives are all butchers. We had a stable under the butcher's shop. My father kept me tied up on a horse for two days and nights... He mistreated me. Then I was helped by my mother, who my father used to always beat the hell out of, because she'd intervene and help me. My mother untied me, I ran away and was never seen again. My father never saw me again. I went with the circus, I swear on my sister's life. I was there for a year and a half. I worked with a woman with no arms! No arms! People said she was pretending that she didn't have any arms. She had no arms, she had nothing here or here. She washed herself with her feet, she put make-up on with her feet, she performed in her show. They'd put her inside the tent, I'd be outside, dancing. I'd be outside pulling people in. I'd dance outside. I'd stand outside and be the barker, I'd shout: "Here's the woman with... and so on." And people would go in. They would pay and go in. THE OBSCENE MARKET THE SWAMP OF VICE AT THE PARK AT THE GARDENS IN FLORENCE DARK NIGHTS IN GENOA THE CRIMES OF THE THIRD SEX THE GREEN DANCES AND MALE PROSTITUTION FILTHY ROME WHEN VICE BECOMES TRAGEDY UNDER THE SHADOW OF SQUALOR THE MERCENARIES REVERSED GEOGRAPHY Call for Raimondo! It's the chief. Hello? Speaking. What? It can't be done? Come on, we're talking about couples, about living together. Not all couples are of mixed sex! No, listen, I think it's something that's so common now, it needs to be taken into consideration. You can't ignore the fact that they exist too. What ambiguity? It's me who goes to play, what doubts are you talking about? Really, I think I'm beyond suspicion! All right, we'll talk about it later. All right. "To Alberto, as a start of things done only for him, Roberto." You wrote this to me on April 16th 1968. I was working in Iraq, I was going back and forth during that period, and that year we met... He looked like this and we decided to set up a home together. This is your photograph... It was taken back then... He's beautiful. Setting up home with a man calmed the waters in my family a bit, but they weren't actually prejudiced. We'd never talked about anything. But, in a middle-class environment, what they feared was a scandal. So getting together with a man, setting up home, that wasn't a scandal. Evidently it wasn't a scandal because they kept quiet about it. Of course, it's hard to know exactly what other people think, like the porter's wife or the people who lived below us. I don't know, but apparently, there weren't any problems. I've never had any problems with sex. Do you mean that you accepted yourself or that you didn't accept yourself? No, in the sense that I really didn't give it any thought. I hadn't yet got my head round it. For example, when I was at the theatre, there were plenty of pretty women who used to say to me: "Why don't you come and see us 7". I would say: "I don't have time, I don't have time...". I was dumb. Did you go to yard? There's a warm wind blowing there today, come on... Thank heavens I wasn't heterosexual or bisexual in fact. If I'd been bisexual they'd have trapped me immediately with marriage, I'd have had a family, I'd have been unhappy for the rest of my life. Hi, I'll pass you onto Roberto because I'm with the film people. I'm happy with my life and I'm very grateful to this man here for all this long-lasting peace of mind. Do you know what it means to know you have someone who will always stand by you? Peace of mind, apart from personal and psychological relationships, is also because by joining finances, you're better off economically. There's more security, at least. In that sense I can understand the demand for civil rights. I'm not bad. But it would be right to be able to adopt children too. - Of course. - If someone feels like doing it. We're talking about lesbians too, who do it more. But a paternal instinct can also be valid in the homosexual field. It's not the case with us, but it could be. - I'd like to adopt a child. - Too late! The camp young men, when they arrived in the shop windows of London, become real pin-up boys. In English 'pin-up boys' means boys you can 'pin-up'. The citizens of Northern Europe, who are scrupulous and methodical, before pinning up a boy with an uncertain personality in a window, try, as a last resort, to save him. Affectionately escorted by his folks, and their devoted chauffeur, the camp lad, in his potential state, is received by a specialist clinic, hidden away in a pretty corner in the suburbs of a big city, away from prying eyes. The methods of treatment used in this type of clinic, real lost property offices for lost individuals, hardly ever give satisfactory results, but only they offer, once the specialized staff has met the patient, the advantage of a precise diagnosis. A conclusive one, unfortunately. But, miss, do you think that... I'm afraid there's nothing we can do. I was on the 93. The 93 was a bus that went from Termini station to Eur. We arrived at what are now called the senators' houses. Back then the senators' houses weren't there. There was a sort of ravine, into which I went, with this guy. And without knowing what to do, I knew what to do. The guy was disgusting, drunk and he couldn't even get it up. The first thing I did was take him in my mouth. My uncle, a Bank of Italy manager, who luckily isn't around anymore, found out from my doctor, who was also his doctor, that I was having homosexual encounters. I'd had to talk to my doctor about diseases, that I'd caught. It was quite amusing. My uncle decided to get a policeman to follow me. "I know that you're homosexual. You can be cured. Go with a prostitute, I'll pay for it". I said: "Let's see what happens". I've always been willing. This woman, she was unattractive from a physical point of view. I mean, there might be some women that you fancy, right? But not this one. I'd visit her twice a day, in the morning then in the evening. So I'd have two sexual encounters a day with this woman. She lived near Via Archimede, I can't remember well. And this woman, of course, debilitated me from an erectile point of view, so, in the evening, after having been with her, I'd go back to the Colosseum, where, obviously... as I'd always been active until that moment, I continued doing the only thing I was able to do. The result was a very pleasant period which ended when my grandma, who lived with me, she was my evil uncle's mother, talked to my parents about it. About what? One night I got home and my mother and father said to me: "Grandma's told us everything". I said: "What has she told you 7". "She's told us that she had to pay your uncle's prostitute, who was also the doctor's prostitute". I was in this absurd situation, I didn't know what to do anymore. I remember, it was two in the morning, and without taking anything, I walked out and left. Then, I realised I couldn't have a family in Italy but I wanted to have a family that receives family allowance, that has all the advantages of a family. So I decided to marry a lesbian. A lesbian I'd met through an ad. - Via Galvani... there's a sign now. - Yes. The first sign that commemorated a faggot... not because he was a faggot, but because he was a genius. Which is much better. Diversity doesn't offend, impoverish or degrade humanity. Diversity is a great thing. I'd like to quote a wonderful verse by Sandro Penna that says: "Happy are those who are different, being different, but wretched, unhappy are those who are different, being ordinary". I became a member of the Christian Democrats knowing that there were many homosexuals, first class ones, let's say, within the Christian Democrats. Like there were in the Left, in the Centre and in the Right, so it affected all areas of politics. It was a transversal party. I'd always been very open and honest with my mother. I was 18, I said to her: "Mom, it's best you hear it from me, rather than from others." I told her I was homosexual, and she said to me: "My dear son, you're free to do as you please, what matters is that you respect your dignity." Of course, I had no problems within the ecclesiastic community either, because I was loved by everyone, having been a member of the youth council for the municipality of Rome, a member of the youth pastoral committee. I also had a career as a journalist which led me to have contacts with a sector of the secret services. I met homosexuals there too. Those members of the secret services who were homosexual were more willing and available to work because they had no family ties. I was part of the Andreotti political trend. Andreotti... was a legendary figure in the Christian Democrats. I don't want to insult the memory of Andreotti, but for certain there was the bisexual element. Those were not my words, Pecorelli made a public declaration. THE DEFENSE MINISTER ANDREOTTI The hole cuts the furrow, and the sword defends it The homophobic repression of those times, was not a total, aggressive repression, it was a hidden and controlled repression. The plans of the Minister Sullo don't concern pretty bathers Sullo, a man with great knowledge in the field of politics, was forced to get married because of his homosexuality. He was criticized by newspapers such as Lo Specchio, Il Borghese and other pseudo-scandalistic colluding publications, all orchestrated and fomented, behind the scenes, by SIFAR for certain, presided by De Lorenzo. As he was an opposer, having founded the New Left minority party, he wasn't liked. Sullo paid the price. We also lived in an secret way, because we didn't want to come out of that condition of secrecy which allowed us to live our homosexuality fully and freely. This is a nude painting I did of a young man, Christian, his name's written on it, Milan, the date... like De Pisis did. Gradually, it revealed itself to me, my homosexuality, after I got married, after I had two children. I loved Laura, who passed away, a great deal, I love my children a lot, there's a strong collaboration, great respect and also something extra that life has given me. I remember one of the first times I went to hustle in a park, that's the term that was used then. And Mario Mieli said to me: "We're not only going to hustle, we also have to show some muscle". Mario was great, he had a great way with words. The great invention, the great emancipation that came out of it was because you could see that others had the same problem as you and this gave you great strength. You were no longer alone in the world. When the great De Pisis went... I take my hat off to him, I'd take everything off, When I talk about De Pisis... they asked him: "But how is it, during the war, that you have a German lover?". A young man he did a beautiful painting of. And he replied: "The body has a different language". And this is a great teaching. - Adelina, but... - Get off, don't touch me! Goodbye, faggot. Adelina! I was fortunate enough to be born into this world whose founder was Parthenope, who is a siren, where duplicity is already part... of the bowels of the land. You set foot in Naples and you don't even notice that, walking through these streets, you become terrestrial and gentle, just like the city expects. Before there was 'poof' or 'faggot', which were words that could be seen as amiable or sweet, depending on who used them to describe you. If someone said: "Get lost, faggot I", then it was derogatory. "You're a real daisy..." and that was derogatory too. But the word 'daisy' had a charm of its own, because in the culture I practiced, in the culture of alleys, it was something that had existed before I existed. Therefore, when I came along, my parents didn't experience the turmoil of having to say: "Oh God, what is this new thing ?". The importation of the word 'gay' has changed things a great deal, because it was like when they put neon lights in kitchens and everything becomes flat. Five minutes before people used 'poof', and 'bum-boy', 'bender', 'daisy', then all of sudden there was a cement. A cement that took the diversity out of diversity. There can be no diversity when you make everyone be the same as everyone else. We found ourselves in this cement that was more harmful than cement buildings. Where were we when... No, you don't know. In Porto... Porto Empedocle. At the campsite, the ladies who did our laundry would put it to one side. It was the advent of AIDS. When things happen, they're not as clear as they are 10 minutes later. When they happen, you say: "Ah, a raindrop! Okay, let's open the umbrella and keep walking". Instead, the culture... the heterosexual culture, in that moment, became really inflexible. It's as if things went backwards really fast to those periods we call the dark ages of history, such as the Middle Ages... it's not at all true, but nevertheless we still tell this historical lie. And they wanted to burn people at the stake, because they were the same ones, the just, and there was an evil invader in the righteous Catholic society, and it was homosexuality. And for the benefit, they summoned, as a witness, someone who happily minds his own business, up in the sky where he lives, to the cause... They evoked him to make him be an evil and perverse master who was once again punishing, after Sodom and Gomorrah, these wrongdoers, these wretched people, who had brought the plague, the new plague! And they caused mayhem, they lay the blame on others, on a category of people and they did not realise they were becoming sick themselves. I am a disaster at occasional flings, but I've always loved the idea of them, so I gave it a go. I'd go to Termini Station, meaning that district of Rome... I'd go to Termini Station, find a spot, sometimes there was great eye candy, walking back and forth. I'm talking about times when this was done, let's say, really systematically. Now the crowds are so big and multiracial that maybe young people find it hard. I think that if you're cautious, then there's uncertainty, and it becomes more difficult. Well, I would find a spot to stand in and I wanted to do what others did, I wanted an easy encounter, a simple one, in the toilets. But I was held back by a kind of... a kind of modesty and I preferred to catch the person's attention and take them to my house. Nowadays it's considered risky and that's true because you're bringing a stranger home with you, but one you immediately love. You say: "I'd love to touch him, taste his body, hold him." That's how it is, and you can't get naked in a station, it'd be a surreal scene, so you do nudity within four walls. And this is what happened. Then, naturally, parallel love stories could be starting elsewhere, but the great excitement came from these encounters and from the very small percentage that followed me. Because one day, I said to a guy: "Listen, shall we go to my house 7". "To do what 7" he replied. So I wasn't his type. That's it, you go your separate ways. Gay people are those who remind us of our love for ourselves and who celebrate us, they celebrate man with art. I don't want to say the usual names of the great men who have loved men, and who created an art in which narcissism reached the highest level. In Italy film directors are actors and actors are film directors, so Pier Paolo Pasolini, the writer, has become a scrounger. What seems like good news is instead a play on words: "The Scrounger" is the film that Pasolini shot as a director. He changed the title and the film is now called "Star". It is, just for a change, a story about young hustlers. What a life for that film where scroungers swapped places with stars, with Pasolini as the director. Why don't writers just write films, then directors and actors make them, instead of making things so complicated? Someone who loves a violent life is instead Pier Paolo Pasolini. PPP leaves with his latest disciple, Ninetto Davoli, from Trastevere. Ninetto is the star of Pier Paolo's latest film which will be called "Little birds and big birds". Pasolini wants to maintain the mystery about his film, so nobody knows whether Ninetto is a little or a big bird. It's a secret that the director is keeping to himself. The inverted "POET". P. P. Pasolini, or rather Marxist cinema as an outlet of one's vices. The bard of the sordid, of the fetid, a dreamt young man with a bony forehead and wrinkly eyelids. A sensitive, Marxist journalist wrote in the ICP's newspaper that he is "as candid and cruel as a saint". From my point of view, as I listen to his smooth, honeyed voice, I'm surprised to find myself thinking that, after all, the story of the robbery in Circeo might even be true. THE PRIESTS OF ASSISI, FROM SAINT FRANCIS TO INVERTED COMMUNIST ODD COUPLES Naturalness of the unnatural Today, our literature is on trial. It stands trial with Pasolini, accused of mocking Calvary. Witnessing for him are professional pornographers the traitors of all flags, a feeble, rascal intellectual class. Standing trial are a people without poetry, hedonistic and corrupt. D'Annunzio was the fast great voice of poetry and of the nation. ITALY'S BARD "ONE OF THOSE" Hot water bottle for Pasolinides ROME: P. P. P. "ROUNDED-UP" We refuse to get in with him. We 're not intellectuals, just an honest pimp and honest streetwalkers. I was born in a small town in Calabria, called San Pietro a Maida. It's a very beautiful, small village in the hills. The sea is six kilometers away. There were six people in my family... My mother, my father, three brothers, one sister... we were a normal family, a simple, poor family. My brother used to take me with him on his bicycle, he'd put me on the crossbar, to go and pick figs to bring home, to bring something home, like my father used to do. My father was the working type, he would do any job going in order to bring something home. Sometimes, when he had nothing else, he'd bring back stones. And my mother would say: "What will you use them for ?". He'd say, "I'll find a use for them". In 1953... my elder brother came to Rome, to Borghetto Prenestino, where my aunt and uncle were living. They sent for us and we all came to Rome. I remember our departure from San Pietro a Maida. For me it was a new, strange thing... A train! We're going to Rome! When we arrived in Rome, we went to my aunt's house, where we all pitched up where we found room. I remember that we were in this house that was my aunt's which was a real dormitory. There was us six, plus my aunt, my uncle, and my cousin, all in this house which looked like a real den. I went to school and I went to work... I worked as a barber, a baker, a delivery boy, I did all sorts of jobs to help the family. One day, with my friends, we went for a wander because that's what you did in Rome. It was called "bunking off." We met up with these friends and went around the suburbs of Rome. One day we ended up in a place called Holy Water. "Why? What's happened? Who are all those people there?" They were making a film. And my brother, who was a carpenter, happened to be there, working as an assistant to someone there. When he saw me he shouted at me: "What are you doing here 7". I said: "Well, I'm hanging out with my friends". He said: "Come here, I'll introduce you to the director." And he took me over to a guy. He said: "Ninè, this is Pasolini". And I look at him, overawed. He said: "Pasolini, this is my brother Ninetto" and Pier Paolo looked at me and stroked my head like this... I was looking at him, and there was something that attracted me to this person, I liked him right away. You know when you just like someone, for no reason, it's just instinctive. And I looked at him. And then to think that this man... he turned my life upside down. A wasted life. THE PASOLINIAN Look, look, Pasolini is kissing a woman! I always said that Pier Paolo wasn't normal! In films, I started playing some cameo roles, but just small jobs to earn some money and also, obviously, because I was an odd type, funny too. They almost always made me play a funny guy. And so I started frequenting the world of films, where homosexuals were more at home too... well, Visconti's never invited me over, even though he respected me, as a journalist, not as a friend. But with Fellini, I had a great friendship. He once said to me: "I'd have liked to have been a faggot, but I like women too much, so I couldn't be". They were all great the days I spent in Rome. I met so many people. I met people like him too. But, everyone wanted me, but he found it amusing because he knew I wasn't available. At the parties he took me to, he didn't worry. There were people who courted me, but he wasn't worried because he knew what I was like. There were lots of people who later visited me in Calabria too. I don't remember their names... but there's something I have to tell you. All right, I don't want to say it, because I'll start saying things that I don't like. What else can I say? Then the trips he took me on were something that... for someone from Calabria, someone who lives in the south, going to Paris, going to London... going to Portugal, going to all these big cities and to all the film festivals... To Venice, Cannes, Nice... I felt like I was in another world. It's something that, thinking about it now, makes me sad. Because look, the things he gave me, were things I could only dream of, to be honest. In Rome, it was easier, obviously, to be homosexual, to make friends. I was living the dolce vita to some extent. I had become a professional journalist, so I had to be somewhat careful. I was called in to the police station because a young man, who I'd been seeing, had stolen something, and I was defending him... So they said to me: "Mr Lane, you concentrate on being a journalist and be careful who you hang around with." And I couldn't tell them who I hung around with. Even policemen were happy to come with me. But, you know, in England the editor of the magazine I was working for, he had lots of military officers coming and going from his house, and then... all right, they're amusing things, but in England it was difficult. A famous actor like John Gielgud was arrested because he pulled an undercover policeman in a public lavatory. Can you imagine that? I'd met many people in Rome, but, they all came here because I helped them. Other gay people. Because I couldn't give them anything. They would become fond of me first, but then I'd take them to others. That's enough, for now. I think that's enough, no? We met just after the death of Pasolini, and I was sort of abandoning my promiscuous life, and so it was lucky for me that I lived outside Rome. Rome was changing. But I remained in Rome for a few more years before moving to Calabria, where, luckily... my friend will tell you, for me, about what happened between us. In the end what was I to do? He couldn't climb the stairs anymore and he sold his house, and I had to take him in. What else could I do? This was John story's. And unfortunately I grew fond of him, even though the people in my house weren't... but they just kept quiet about it. This is it, I don't know what else to say, if you want to ask me some questions, I'll try to... Now, I'm starting to get a bit emotional. No one could imagine that the young tailor Federico Schubert was a father. Father of a girl of marrying age, to be clear. Schubert accompanied his daughter Gretel to the altar. With his own deft hands, he sewed the wedding veil and of course he designed the dress and its ten meter train. Schubert, without his famous jewels, his famous precious bracelets. This was his jewel. Moved, emotional, and why not, a bit worried too. Standing to one side, Mrs Schubert, her husband takes her place. A close friend of the father of the bride. In the end, though, everyone agreed: it was a wonderful wedding celebrated in a very intimate atmosphere. The fact I was homosexual, in my profession, helped me a great deal. I'd created an haute couture pret à porter range. Pret à porter means making lots of individual pieces at the same time, but mine were made one by one. Everyone went crazy. The Japanese immediately came and signed me up for many years, America and Paris did likewise. I traveled all over the world but I never wanted to have a fling. I could have had one, I received proposals, but I always tried to safeguard myself, and my job, and I didn't like certain things. I obviously wasn't cut out for it. I went to a Jesuit and I said: "Listen... in your opinion, why do I have this tendency? I can't accept it." He replied: "What if you'd been born with a limp? How would you have walked? You'd have limped. But bear in mind that you have to be very tactful, you have to be very careful about what you do, and you mustn't do anything obscene.... So that was the advice from someone who... I had the courage to go because I couldn't accept myself, okay? I'd heard that in Switzerland they gave you injections that cured you, that balanced things out. I did some research and I was told: "Listen Moses, don't do anything, because if in your blood there are many more female cells, by having this injection, they will increase. Those who have a few are lucky, but who knows? Nobody knows... And so I said: "No, I'm not going". I tried everything! "Happy to be different, by being different. But woe to the man who is different by being ordinary." Well, it's like a threat for ordinary people but a promise of happiness for those who are different. I've been different, and I still am, because I am still alive. I have been happy about my nature, as it was. That's what's made me happy. Being different allowed us to have fleeting affairs, just like life was back then. I couldn't bear to be in heaven sitting on a chair, like I am here, in perfect adoration. No. I'm frivolous, I like fluttering around here and there. And how can a queer man not be happy when he can have a sexual encounter then immediately leave and run off? I experienced love, above all, in friendship. Sex, instead, is a naughty thing you do in an instant. Back then the main doors of houses would be left ajar, so every now and again you'd hide in the shadows, do something secretly, quickly, then leave. That's the happiness experienced by a homosexual who isn't obliged by marriage to go to bed, every night, with the same person. How boring... He pleaded her, not for himself, but for their child. She refused, and one day, tired of his pleading she left, leaving him holding their child, me! My dad loved me the way I was. My father had had TB for a year. We went to Lake Como because the air is more pure, and he took me with him. A year of love. I was happy with him talking to me as if I were an adult. When I asked him where babies came from, he was able to explain to me, with simple and plain words, the secret of nature, of birth. He believed that everything I did was right. My mom said: "Kids are born perfect, it's society that's wrong." Because she considered Rousseau to be a great philosopher and then she'd been to Montessori schools and so she mixed boys with girls. In the third year at elementary school a girl became a boy... "The midwife must've made a mistake", said my mother, and to the family that wanted to move city, she said: "No, just change the school apron, replace the white one, get a black apron with a blue bow". "Dear children", she said, "instead of Valeria, here's Valerio!" Why can't I find... that photo as a man. Here he is! Luciano is here. Here he is! Luciano is here. He was twenty, my dear... Twenty years old! In London, they put me in a room which said 'men'. Then after the operation it said 'women'. "Ah, at last!" But I suffered a great deal because afterwards I endured rejection... But, I managed to get to Turin and to start living. And that's where I started my life as a woman. I was gorgeous as a young man, but I prefer myself like this! Like this... Like this, the way I feel now, as an old woman. But... I'm still me. A woman. When you change sex there are positive things but also negative things. So you think of them, before and after, because you don't forget what you were before. I remember, unfortunately, when I was intact, I could feel things that I don't feel anymore. I mean, sex was complete before. Now, let's say it's sex... that they say trans... yes, let's say, I go into a trance, because I just go into a trance. It's no longer real sex. You're a woman and that's it, but sex is dull because they've taken it away from you. They've stolen it from you. Because, before, when I went with a man, I felt What he felt, I felt it! Now I feel the affection, but I don't feel anything anymore. I feel annoyance! Sol insult him, I insult him... I even insult him but I asked for it. But it's gone. That's the problem. This is the problem. Umberto Bindi! "Our concert". We were talking about the discrimination that you endured. That this, this press that saw your songs only as... Exactly, I was too involved, even by my producers. Yes, after all, the result was a negative and unpleasant figure. 1961 was a terrible year for me, for Gino Paoli, for Mina, and perhaps I suffered more than the others as I wasn't as strong, in terms of character. Yes, but I, for example, know this because I continued to follow you, but what was happening to you. The story about the diamond... I do have one, quite a large one. But I don't regret anything that happened to me, and what I endured. The height of extravagance. A ring said to be worth four million and that had every newspaper in Italy talking about it. An exaggeration of mine that smacked of exhibitionism, do you understand? And then, this attachment to my mother, I can justify it, even though I don't approve of mummy's boys. I loved my mother, she gave me a home and true affection. Today, I don't have any diamonds and unfortunately... I don't have my mother either. Sorry, I didn't need this. It's something which always really gets to me. I don't regret the love I felt for my mother in any way, even if, in actual fact, they almost threw it back in my face. With things like this: "Go to mummy! Run to mummy I", things like that. Reflections on homosexuality, September '98. They say it's no longer a controversial topic. But I still witness derision, and condescending attitudes. TEN YEARS LATER ROBERTO'S MANUSCRIPT My manuscript. By Roberto. I'm Roberto. Funny, huh? The time he wrote to that priest at the RAI... "Father, forgive me for writing to you. I am a young man and I'm a homosexual, even though I find this term hard to digest. For me, it would be more precise to say that I'm effeminate, in fact, ever since I was a child I've always felt very feminine, very delicate. Naturally I was always mocked by others. I've always lived alone with my mother. We live off our pensions. I also receive a modest allowance because I don't work. I have issues, but I would prefer to work, to deal with life, but instead I live this solitary life. Sometimes I hate myself." Yes, because at a certain point, a young man, especially, racks his brains, and thinks: “Why can't I do it 7“. I don't know... sometimes I go from feeling love to hatred for myself. It's incredible. "I've never had any significant friendships, even though I'm attracted to men. When I was a young boy, I would dream about changing sex, but then I realised that that thought of mine was absurd. Some years ago I even tried to commit suicide by taking a large dose of barbiturates. It was a miracle that they saved me, but, because of the law, they took me to a psychiatric hospital, to study me. They locked me up with sick people who were in almost animal-like states. That was a moral violence that was inflicted on me, an abuse, a violation of my personal freedom that was inflicted on me. They kept me locked up in there with the false pretense that they were going to cure me of my madness." So homosexuals are mad then. "The preachers make speeches full of rhetoric. It's a sin, they say. They are scared. I strongly believe in God, but God does not want me to die a painful death because of strict prohibitions created by man. Perhaps, father, you will not reply to my letter in your radio show, because you too will be afraid of tackling this topic, or if you do talk about it, you too, father, will talk about it disapprovingly. Forgive me. Kind regards." Do you want to hear some more? How wonderful... In mental hospitals the only treatments used back them were electroshock treatments or lobotomies, meaning that they would remove part of your brain. And still now, this was told to me by a friend who was a psychiatrist, he said: "In mental hospitals there are plenty of men, quite young, suicides, for no specific reason. They would all throw themselves out of the windows and die like that. I think about my life, about the fact that I lost, not my father, because I didn't even know him, but I lost my mother. Being an orphan is a terrible condition, you see everyone else with parents and you are totally alone. But I think the fact that I was an orphan, when I discovered that I was gay, became a positive factor, in the sense that I didn't endure the drama experienced by children when their parents discover that they are gay, lesbian, or homosexual. It's a terrible drama. I didn't go through that. I didn't go through that because I'd endured a drama previously, and that's the worst aspect of my life. Why do you have to be an orphan in order to be happy being gay? It's absurd! But, in our reality, with this vision of the family, which still exists, this is the situation. And so I'm always astonished and I can't answer the question: "Why me? What can I do 7". When you suffer because of emotional problems you're always alone and you never understand why it's happened to you. It was October 29th 2010, 19:00. I had decided to tell my mother, in short, that I was homosexual because that day there had been a scene which had led me to reveal what I was. While I was walking around the centre with my mother, there was a young man that was obviously gay and my mother had said something like... "Oh, poor thing, I feel sorry for him". I don't know why but when she said that I felt an urge inside me, an urge that was telling me to declare what I was. And so, that day, at 19:00, amidst tears from the effort, I told my mother that I was gay. A year and a half later, during the summer holidays, while I was 'liking' some pictures on Facebook, the new class at school, which I was attending, noticed this and on the group page they asked me whether I was gay. Obviously I wasn't afraid, I had nothing to hide, I had no reason to deny it so I immediately told the truth. That yes, I was homosexual. Obviously, like in every group, there's always someone who doesn't approve. I spent the whole summer feeling anxious, with the fear that upon my return, in the fall, everything might change. They joke with you, they make funny comments, and this, in a certain way, makes you stronger and it pushes you to go forward, to not give up, to stand up for what you are, to not get used to what people say, that homosexuality is bad. I find it hard to find someone special. I find it hard to make a move on somebody I like. If I like someone at school I can't say to them: "I fancy you". In the worst case scenario, I'd get punched. So I don't know... We'll see what happens. HAPPY TO BE DIFFERENT
