And it's not always possible to know which side of that line we are standing on. The violence between disparate sides is not endemic to this culture. it is endemic to all cultures. We are again tribes. But defining our tribe is not as simple as the black people born under the sun, or the white people born under the moon. Our division is, wrong others against right self. And this division does not rest simply on an unfamiliarity with a tribe other than our own. It's deeper than that. Sir? Yes? It's the 21st century, Dr. Mackles. With my phone, I can learn about any culture on the planet. I'm a Google search away from knowing everything about a belief system in 20 minutes. Let me ask you a question. What if that belief system you Googled was so antithetical to your own, that would seem, for lack of a better word, insane? Like what? MACKLES: Well, like, uh, take medicine. Here, medicine is all pharmaceutical compounds created in laboratories, sold by faceless corporations to millions. In other parts of the world, medicine is a plant. A bit of bark, a root, or a mineral. Or a combination of all of them. Administered to one man by another man who is believed to channel powers that you could not begin to comprehend. This medical knowledge is based on ancient beliefs. The tenets of which in this country, it would just make your blood run cold. Metaphysical beliefs in healing and humanity. That would seem, um, insane to you, no matter how hard you tried to understand them. But it is the very belief in such things that gives this medicine it's power. (BELL RINGS) Looks like we're out of time. So, we'll take this up again next week. Thank you. Mr. Hobbs. I want you to do something for me. A little extra credit, if you will. I want you to take that phone in your pocket and find me a culture that is so inverse to your own that the idea of it taking root here, in this city, would scare the bejesus out of you. Yes, sir. (RADIO DISPATCHER) (TIRES SQUEAL) (INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING) Get the fuck in there! Don't fucking move. GIRL: No! Wait! Hey! GIRL: Stop! What are you doing in there? I'm Detective Boyd.

MARIA: Don't talk to her! Come on, give me you hand. What are you doing with her? Keep your hands up! Look, I'm gonna get you outta here. Come on. Maria? Hey, where are you going? Maria? Where you going? You can't take her! Hey, man. Get on your fucking-- She stays with me, pal. Get down on your feet now. I didn't do anything wrong, man. Yeah? She came willingly with me.

Who is interviewing who? I am interviewing you, sir. I do not do business with anyone, I do not know everything about. Neither do I. Mr. Randoku, I'm a man who explores options of power, as you say. It is elusive. You are a man who harvests power, and bottles it even. You're also a man with a lot of eyes on you right now. I have a plane that can take you anywhere you like. (RANDOKU LAUGHS) Appreciate the kind words, sir. I do not need your help. You... need me. Let me know when you are ready. Think of the souls you could've harvested there, Mr. Randoku. ANGIE: Detective Boyd, did you feel any sense of vindication when you fired at the suspect? Other than it was him or me? No. Did the death of your own daughter in any way affect your decision to fire on Mr. Preston? No. DEPARTMENT REP: Let's be honest, Ms. Cannon. Mr. Preston was clearly leaning forward at the time of the shooting, reaching for a gun. Any more questions? (WATER BUBBLING) DEELIE: You okay? Yeah. (LUCAS SIGHS) That's not convincing. (SCOFFS) No, I'm okay. I had another bad dream. DEELIE: Do you want to talk about it? No. Not really. (LUCAS YELLS) (SIGHS) (SOFT MUSIC PLAYS) (PHONE RINGS) (BELL TOLLS) RANDOKU: Hello?

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, you get your ass over to the shrink and see if you can fool her. I think I'm having a hard time hearing you 'cause all I can hear are the voices. You know? Fuckers... You having fun? Yeah, loads. (SEAGULL SQUAWKS) MARIA: I was thinking maybe you should take a vacation. Oh, yeah? Yeah. I'm just curious. Where would you send me? Anywhere but here. And do what? I don't know. Fish. Go out on a charter boat. Fish? Drop a line in the water. Maria, that sounds fucking horrible. Well, you need it. (LUCAS GROANS) MARIA: Between you and I and just us. Yeah? Was he really going for his gun? Maria, let me ask you a question. Do you think anybody misses Ted Bundy? That's not an answer. No. It is, if you're listening. Fuck that.

JIMMY: A floater. Caucasian female. She's been dead, maybe 6 hours. MARIA: Oh, fuck. Any ID? JIMMY: No. Nothing. MARIA: Age? JIMMY: Maybe 14, 15. Somebody did a real number on her. Her hands, genitals have been removed. You mean, crabs got to her? You don't lose the parts she's missing to wildlife. She was cut before she was dumped. If it wasn't a scalpel, it was something just as sharp. Eyes, eyelids. Yeah. Left hand, missing. Gone. You think that's what killed her, Bill? No. Death was a courtesy of this. Throat cut. Bled out. Her veins are full of river silt. The only DNA we found was that of hers. And these marks. Look at these. It's like some kind of rope. Hung by her feet. Like a side of beef. Goddamn. This isn't getting any better. BILL: I'll know more later. MARIA: All right. MARIA: Thanks, doc. Can you send it upstairs for me? BILL: Yeah. MARIA: Thank you. You okay? Hmm? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Just give me a second. All right, gang related or... LUCAS: No, no, no, no. This ain't gang related. MARCHANT: No? It's more methodical. Somebody with a purpose. Yeah. With a purpose, right? Come on, Boyd. You don't know that yet. (SCOFFS) MARIA: What if he's right? About what? You have other cases with so much better leads. Now just do your job. Get the hell out of here. LUCAS: Captain? Yeah? You didn't see what she looked like. MARIA: What are you thinking? LUCAS: I'm thinking another good cop became a bureaucrat. MARIA: Well, how about I buy you a drink? LUCAS: Sounds great. BOY: Ooh! Yo! That's a brick! BOY 1: Oh, come on, dude! Hit me! I'm open! I'm open! BOY 2: Air ball! BOY 1: Shoot it! Shoot it!

It's time to go, little bro. Wait. Where am I going? Well, you're going home. But I wanna play with you. You're going home. It's getting late. Mom's gonna be worried. You know, you got homework.

Maria, I'm dealing with it the best way I know how. I'm just saying, if it were me, I'd be gone in a heartbeat. Well, it ain't you. And I'm not you. Come on now. I'm no shrink. (BOTH CHUCKLE) That's for fucking sure, you aren't a shrink. (BOTH LAUGH) What? I'm just gonna be your friend. Thank you. Okay. Be great. You know what friends do? They order shots.

(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) BILL: The old man would've died anyway from his throat being cut, if he'd had a heart left to pump the blood out. What? His heart had been sliced out clean, and there was no blood in his throat. So whoever did this, it was awfully quick. I mean, when you say quick, like, how quick? I mean, like his heart might've still been beating. LUCAS: But what about the heart? Did you find it? (SIGHS) No. LUCAS: No? No. Didn't find it. What about the boy? BILL: Well, the boy was like the first girl. Yeah? Mutilated. Parts cut off. Missing. One thing. Whatever this guy is using, is sharp as hell. Okay. Want a little snoot? Got some good whiskey here. LUCAS: Yeah, I'll take a little snoot. And there's another, uh... another thing interesting. LUCAS: Yeah? Remember those things you brought from the altar? Yes, sir. Well... Cheers. This one... (CONTENTS SHAKE IN JAR) It's finely powdered gold. What do you mean, gold? Like Fort Knox Gold. No shit. And these... These are some herbs you brought. Yeah? I've been able to ID one of 'em. And it's, uh, something called rooibos. What's that? Well, there's been some research on it. It's from Africa. It's a red tea. Mmm. It ain't that kinda tea though. Thanks, Bill. Not like you drink. (LUCAS LAUGHS) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) Shit. Excuse me. Do you know where Dr. Mackles' office is? That way. It's back this way? Yeah. Gosh. MACKLES: Come in. May I help you? LUCAS: Well, I hope so. Are you Dr. Mackles? Yes. I'm homicide detective Lucas Boyd. Do you mind if I sit? So, you teach African studies, is that right? (LUCAS CLEARS THROAT) Yes. LUCAS: Are you from Africa? Yes. Lesotho. Where is that at? It's a small country in the heart of South Africa. Oh. Is my being African important? LUCAS: Well, again, I hope so. Do you, uh, know what rooibos is? Yes. It's tea. Just tea? Well, it's sometimes used medicinally. Mmm-hmm. Um, smell this, and tell me what it is, will you? (SNIFFS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) Where did you get this? Why? What is it? Dr. Mackles. What is it? It's... herbs. Mmm-hmm. Just any kind of herbs? Well, I would say yohimbe bark and, uh, some other fermented tree roots. LUCAS: Hmm. Where'd you get it? I found it at a crime scene. What kind of crime? Well, I'm a homicide detective, sir. Can you tell me what these writings are? You could easily google this, Detective. I know. I know. And I actually did. It didn't make sense to me. But then I did Google leading scholars in African culture, and your name came up, as the best and brightest. So, here I am. I'm sorry. I cannot help you. Well, I appreciate your time, sir. (DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES) (INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING) (DRUMMING) (SPEAKING ITALIAN) (SPEAKING ITALIAN) (SPEAKING ITALIAN) I'm just looking for someone. A ghost. I need to put a name to this face. I've seen him around. Great. He's my main suspect in some strange killings. We found an altar. Blood. I don't really know what it means. He's a Sangoma. Sangoma? Touched by God. A witch doctor. He works for clients. What kind of clients? Rich and powerful ones. May I give you a word of advice? Mmm-hmm. Be careful. He could be coming for you. Thank you. Is everything okay? (INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING) Dr. Mackles, I need your help. God dam it, two kids are dead. They were butchered like hogs. You know what these writings are, don't you? Now, please, take another look. I cannot help you. Can't or won't? You're scared, aren't you? (POLICE DISPATCHER RADIO) Watch your step, doctor. Oh. LUCAS: What is it, doctor? MACKLES: It's Swahili. Zulu. Hmm. It identifies territory. Identifies how? Uh, centers of power, or... ways to get access to that power. Do me a favor. Can you read that right there? Well, roughly. Uh, "Here I take the power. "Here I become the power." Your man is a Sangoma. A medicine man. In your culture, you would call him a witch doctor. The way he's killing, that makes sense. You ever hear the term "Muti," Detective? No. It's Zulu. It means medicine. But, Muti has a dark side. So, are you saying that he is using the body parts for medicine? Exactly. Right. Well, you know, pharmaceutical companies use stem cells from aborted fetuses to create vaccines. Right. Well, this is just a primitive version of that concept. I'm listening. Well, in a metaphysical sense, it can be tied to what can be referred to as "the warrior tradition." Put simply, it's a ritual performed to order. To make one a warrior, or to provide power to that warrior. Sangomas have been practicing Muti for centuries. (YELLS) (YELLS) MACKLES: Businessmen, politicians, salesmen, you, anyone. People who pay for Muti are seeking personal success, power, protection. They believe that Muti strengthens their personal force, gives them an edge. In Muti, specific body parts have a distinct effect. Mmm-hmm. Genitals, they bring virility, good luck. Especially if they're virgin. Right. The eyes, farsightedness, clarity of vision. The brain, knowledge, political power. Mmm-hmm. The Sangoma takes whatever they need for a specific outcome. Jesus Christ. But, there's more. A Sangoman must take the flesh while the victim is still alive... Right. In order to get the power they seek... Mmm-hmm. ...they must awaken the gods to bestow it. Which means... the screams of the victim... Right. ...are critical. The more intense the scream, the more powerful the Muti. Then the body parts are mixed with the victim's blood, herbs, clay, gold, all of which is believed to attract and hold power. That elixir is drunk by the client or the Sangoma, in order to get the power they seek. They believe that it turns them into a warrior. Makes them a warrior. And an undefeatable one. Sounds unbelievable to me. Right. To you, Detective. To him, it's simply business. And very real. Very real. Whatever he's about to do, it feels he needs power to do it. Mmm-hmm. And understand this. These first two, they were just him getting ready. He did them for himself. Capisce? MARIA: Do you really believe in this? Mmm-hmm. Yes. This is just too sick. I mean, Maria, it's sick enough to be real, you know. I just wish I could see this motherfucker's face. All I see right now is a monster. (SIGHS) I want one that's beautiful. One with pretty eyes. One filled with life and promise. Oh, I want her to have a great deal of intelligence. And so much more to live for. (SIGHS) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (TV PLAYING FAINTLY) Welcome.

MARCHANT: Hey, Boyd. Sit down. (LUCAS CLEARS THROAT) Boyd! I think he's onto something. Yeah, like what? Captain, we have two officers down. MARIA: Get Boyd. Is your name Terry? Ma'am?

He was a black guy. He was. He was kind of handsome. Yeah. (WHIMPERING) And, he was covered with scarification on his face. He had scarring on his face? Did you get a name by any chance? Yeah? What was his name? (SNIFFLES) (SNIFFLES) Terry, what was his name? Randoku. Randoku? Randoku. (SOFTLY) Okay. All right, come on. Let me get you up. Come on. Let me help you. (SOBS) Maria. We got a name. Randoku. Go on, let's sort that out. Come on. Jimmy, anything? Yeah. (SIGHS) Lots of anythings. Yeah? Got a thumb, forefinger, ring finger. Okay. Good thing your boy likes tequila. You're saying he's about 6, 6'3", 6'4" maybe? 6'4", I would say, yeah. Jimmy, give me a name on these prints. These weird, uh, scars on his face. Scars on his face. Thank you. Thank you. Boyd. This lady said she just seen a black guy coming in and out of that unfinished apartment building. Hadn't seen him around until a few days ago. Said he has scars on his face. That's our guy.

MAN: Let's go, let's go! (BELLS TOLLING) I'm hoping you see something I wouldn't. I'll try. LUCAS: After you. So why'd you come here to America? New start, I guess. Yeah? You got any family? No. My brothers and sisters are still back in Africa. LUCAS: Take a look at this. DR. MACKLES: My father worked in medicine. He worked with the tribes. My mother worked with him. LUCAS: Mmm. LUCAS: Well, for what it's worth, I'm sorry I dragged you into this shit. No, you're not. You're right. I'm not. You know, in certain cultures, I could have your head or another body part. Is that right? Yeah. As an apology to make me feel better. Mmm. Greece, Asia, certain African tribes. If a certain member of a tribe offended another member by delving too deeply into his personal affairs, the chief could have that person killed and the body part delivered as a gift. Hmm. A way of saying, problem solved. Well, thank God that ain't legal in this country. I'd be mailing out body parts all day long. Let me know if you need anything. (PAPERS RUSTLING) Nothing. Sorry, Detective. You're still here? This fucker killed two of my men. VALERIA: You're okay? Ten children in Tanzania kidnapped and killed for body parts. A dozen children in Spain. Thousand of children are missing all across Europe. And you ask me how I'm doing? You can't let it get to you. That's what I keep telling myself. But how hard does your heart have to get in order to live? VALERIA: Maybe you should go home. Be with your family. My family, yeah. (INHALES) You're right. (SIGHS) I think there comes a day in everyone's life where they realize they don't really matter much. Whatever their goals are really don't amount to shit. And that is a very sad day. Oh, thank you. You're a fucking piece of work, Lucas. DEELIE: You're a fucking... LUCAS: We're not doing this. DEELIE: We're not doing this again? We're not doing this again? You know what you're not gonna do it?

LUCAS: Come on, come on. I need some of your brew. Come on in. What's going on? You doing okay? Yeah. I take it you never saw that shrink, did you? Mmm. There was something that I wanted to show you, I found in Randoku's apartment the other day. Look at this. It's, uh, it's Farner Ltd. It's a multibillion dollar, multinational, mega corporation. Good one. Have you ever heard of... Farner company. I know that asshole. Donates a lot of money. I don't know. I guess the question is though is what they're talking about here is that there's a big vote Tuesday. How important do you think this is to him? (TELEPHONE RINGING) Hold. It's Lucas. They have something in forensics. We'll be right down. Thanks. MAN: I got this from the bar. But there were no matches in US database, so, I checked Interpol, and I got this. When I superimpose them, I give you one M'Gushu Randoku. Born in South Africa, Zulu heritage. Says he was in Rome recently. What about his port of entry? Where was it? Uh... Came into New Orleans a week ago. Anything else? Well, yeah. Old M'Gushu here? Been dead for six years. Here's his death certificate signed by a Sudanese General. MARCHANT: That doesn't mean he's dead. It might just mean he has friends in high places who can help him disappear. He ain't dead. Not yet. CLAUSSEN: Hey, Lucas. Yeah? How's Kersch? She's fighting for her life, Claussen. (SIGHS) Check this out. This was in Randoku's place. Shit. Not sure what it's about. You know what, I'll look into it, thanks. All right. You got it.

Okay, well, you don't understand. This is an emergency. I'm investigating a murder of two children. Now, I'd love if you could get him on the cell phone or his home. I don't give a fuck where he is. Just call him. VALERIA: (ON PHONE) Okay, okay. Scusi. I find him. (SIGHS) (PHONE BEEPS) MARIO: (ON PHONE) Si? Inspector Lavazzi? MARIO: Yes. LUCAS: (ON PHONE) I'm Detective Lucas Boyd. I'm investigating a murder of two children. Um, one of the suspects that we're looking for is a man by the name of M'Gushu Randoku. He's killed two children here in America. The interesting thing is we found your card at his apartment. Is there a reason for that? He was kidnapping young women all throughout Europe. LUCAS: Whoa, what'd you say? He was kidnapping young women all throughout Europe, Detective. I almost caught him here in Rome a few weeks ago. But the son of a bitch got away. Okay, well, is there anything you can help me with? Because he's doing the same thing here. I know who he works for. LUCAS: Who? I can't prove it. I know it as a cop. Yeah, okay, well, just talk to me like a cop then. We found some CCTV footage of Randoku meeting with a South African businessman. I later found out his identity. His name is Shelby Farner. MARIO: F-A-R-N-E-R. MARIO: Farner. I appreciate it. Thank you. (CLEARS THROAT) Prego, Detective. Prego. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Can I help you? Yes, ma'am. I'm Detective Boyd. Is Shelby Farner around? Yes, he is. Go get him for me, please. All right. Okay. (FOOTSTEPS COMING DOWN STAIRCASE) LUCAS: Mr. Farner? Yes. Detective Boyd. Do you mind if we have a word? Certainly. Uh... Come with me. LUCAS: I appreciate that. Thank you. What are you doing? You touch another fucking kid in my city, and I'm gonna fucking put a bullet in your head. What are you talking about? I'm gonna put a fucking bullet in your head. You hear me?

Yeah, I mean, our coach tells us that winning isn't everything, but that giving it your best is what it's all about. What's the point of putting in all that work if you're not trying to win? (LAUGHS) Ah, Katie, you are just delightful. I'll bet you're a straight A student. Yes, sir. Straight A's. Delightful. And your favorite subject is... A tie between math and science. But I love music, too. And math is obviously a big part of music, so... Obviously. (BOTH LAUGH) So, how do you know my parents? Oh, we've known each other for ages. So weird. They never mentioned you before. Well, I find that difficult to believe. (LAUGHS) They really haven't. Oh, come on! (BOTH LAUGH) Really. Ah, Katie. I can't tell you how perfect you are. Thank you! Let's get Katie ready. Ready for what? (SMACKS LIPS) Oh... It's a surprise. (BOTH CHUCKLE) CLAUSSEN: Her name's Katie. How are they dealing with it? Well, usual. Fed playbook. No calls. Mm-hmm. No ransom demand. I need to tell them about Randoku. Yeah. Well, when you do, just take them into the other room, all right? (EXHALES) It's him. Yeah, I know. Can I make a suggestion? Sure, yeah. If he is working for Farner... Mm-hmm. ...they're gonna want to do the ceremony at a very safe place. So I would look for properties owned by Farner. Especially warehouse-type near water. Mmm. (DISPATCHER RADIO STATIC) Give me some good news, Claussen. Farner Industries owns a lot of property in town. They got one warehouse by the river. I'm sending you the address now. Got it. Thanks.

I found something that might be helpful. What? MARIO: Randoku was here in Rome attending a lecture from someone from your city. A college professor by the name of Mackles. All of this happened nine months ago. They also met several times after the lecture. Mm-hmm. Right. Maybe this can help you somehow. I appreciate the call. (EXHALES) (SIGHS) (THUD) (WHISPERS) Aw, man. God damn it. (BREATHES HEAVILY) All right. DR. MANNHEIM: Detective? Mmm, yeah. Detective? Are you okay? (WHISPERS) She was my partner. DR.

(CHUCKLES) Oh, Jesus. It's okay. It's gonna be okay. Oh, thank you. You know, every once in a while, there's a miracle. I guess so. (CHUCKLES) Yeah. You know, a friend of hers came by last night and stayed for about an hour. And then I saw him leave. What do you mean? What did he look like? Um, he was a tall, greying black man. Probably about 70s. With very kind eyes. I think he prayed over her, and then I saw him leave. What did he say? He just said she was going to be all right. And then he said a word I didn't understand. Yeah, what was that? Muti? I don't know. Thank you for saving her, Doctor. You're welcome. Thank you. DR. MANNHEIM: You bet.
