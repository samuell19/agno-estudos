(technological music) (fireworks popping) (gentle piano music) - [Operator] We have an alert of a silent alarm at Urban Surplus located at 1013 Douglas Avenue, corner of Franklin. Any unit in the vicinity please respond. (gentle music) (sirens blaring) - [Ethan] Detective Tony, this is Adam 10. We're 84 at 101 pickin' up the tab. - [Operator] 1610, 21 picking up. (Latin music) - Whoo! - Jesus, Blair, not now. - What you mean, not now? You know what it is baby, (speaks foreign language). One life to live, you better live it, right. Hey! (Latin music) (siren blares) Well, look who's here, the lovely Aggie. - [Agnes] What do you guys think? - I think you look good. - Blair, guess what. - Wouldn't it be something if there's somebody inside. You know how much overtime that'd be, time and a half? Could be good, huh? - Hey, you wanna go in? You could use some of that academy training. - I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what. Me and Agnes will go in, we'll check out her rear. - What, no, Blair. - Come on. Hey, you New York's finest, Mami. - Get serious. - I am being serious. - You want a smoke? - No, thanks. My father caught me smoking when I was 14. Big lecture. - I think your dad's a big shot defense attorney, is that true? - Yeah, I guess so. - Let me ask you something. How come you're slumming here? Private school, good college. You ain't gotta be here. - What are you talking about? I'm not slumming. I wanna be here. You know, everyone I went to school with, they're all sitting in an office somewhere. When I look back, I wanna feel like, I don't know, like something real happened. (glass breaks) - Hey! All right! - Blair look, the lock's busted. Mackey. - Yeah, go ahead. - Looks like there's someone inside. We're going in. - Take cover. - Shouldn't we call for the sergeant for more backup? - You don't wanna fuck with the sergeant on a Sunday night unless it's totally necessary. Hey, you people, clear out, vamoose. - Whoo! Yeah! - [Vandal 1] Let's get outta here. - [Vandal 2] You go, I'm not done shopping. - [Operator] At 352 Silver, a report of a roving van of kids throwing eggs. - I'm getting worried. They've been inside an awful long time. (gun fires) On three, one, two, three. Drop your gun! - Fuck you! (guns fire) You wanna play rough? - Shoot, Ethan. - I can play rough. (gun fires) - What the fuck you doing? Shoot him. - Trick or treat motherfucker. - Shoot him. Shoot him, kid. Shoot him, goddamn it. - Come out, come out wherever you are. - [Mackey] Goddamn it, shoot it. - [Vandal 1] Come on. - No, please, no, no. - Say you're sorry. - I'm sorry. Oh, God. - Too late. (gun fires) Hey, all you, man. - Goodnight. (gun fires) (gun fires) - [Agnes] Blair, you're bleeding. - Ethan. - [Agnes] Mackey! - Ethan. - Meckey. - Oh, shit. You okay? You all right, bro? - I really screwed up. - Oh, God. - What the fuck is up, man. Talk to me, yeah? - There's no spent shells. There's no spent shells, what happened? You never even pulled the trigger, did you? - Put it on. - What the hell did they give you a gun for you pussy motherfucker. - Hey, that's enough. - I hope you live your whole fucking life. I'm gonna nail your fucking ass. When I'm done with you, every cop in the country- - Calm down. - Is gonna know what a dismal fucking coward piece of shit you are. - Listen, listen. - [Agnes] He should be dead instead of Mackey. - That's not gonna bring Meckey back, okay. He's a good kid, he just shouldn't be, down! (gun fires) Oh, fuck, fuck. Give me your gun, give me your fucking gun. (gun fires) Okay. Now get your shit together. They're gonna come here. They're gonna be asking questions. You say it happened too fast for me to remember anything, okay? I'll do the talking. You understand. Do you understand? Do you fuckin' understand? - Yeah. - Okay. - And after this blow over, you turn in your badge. - No. - You turn in your badge, yes, you quit. You turn in your fucking badge, you quit. Say yes, I understand. - Yes. - Okay. Get your shit together. - Back up! - Get over here! - On behalf of the City of New York and its grateful citizens, I am proud to present to Officer Blair Valdez and Officer Ethan Lang for actions above and beyond the call of duty. This is no doubt the highest honor for extraordinary courage in the line of fire. (gentle music) - When you think about our heritage as a species, you're not really surprised by the crime that we do have. You're actually much more startled by the crime that we don't have. I mean, we're all still animals to a certain degree, although you can argue we have our cerebral checks. It's not really within our nature to stay on quote the right side of the line. You know, civilization is merely a thin crust that prevents us from plummeting into chaos. (Latin music) - Hey. 8 o'clock? - 8 o'clock. - Love ya. (Ethan sighs) - Ethan? - Blair? - Paquito, man. - Man. - How are you, how are you? - What are you doing here? - Man, PD told me if I don't get some education, they'll put my ass back in uniform, man. Like I'm a arrest more bad guys if I read Moby's Dick. You believe that shit? They kind of treat me like I'm outdated, man. - Outdated? I see you all the time on the 11 o'clock news, you're doing great. - The street guy. - I mean, you made your case, right? - What about you, man? Hey, this place is beautiful. You happy, I mean, look, you, you a professor, right? - Associate professor. It's not a very exciting job. - Well, that's great man, I'm proud of you - It's pretty boring actually. - Hey, hey, let me take you to lunch for a minute, huh? Let's go get some hot dogs. - You know, I have to teach a class in six minutes. I've gotta take a rain check. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. I need a favor, man. - Yeah, sure, whatever you want. I mean, I certainly owe you. - No, no, no, you don't owe me, man, we're friends. You'd have done the same for me. Here's the deal, man. You know me and school, man. I mean, you could hit me upside the head with with a Webster's dictionary and the shit won't stick. If I registered here, could you, um, could you, you know, mentor me, like teach me? - You know, I could do better than that. Why don't you sign up for one of my criminology classes and you got yourself an A. - You'd do that? - Yeah. - Hey, man, I never had an A. I miss you, man. Come to dinner with me. - No. - No, tonight. - I can't. - Listen, listen, listen, now wait a minute. There's a party for one of the sergeants, birthday party. - It'll be full of cops. - That's ancient history. It's all good, man. It's at that place you used to like, remember the place with the little waitress that I used to like with the big butt, Paulitalina? Yeah? - Yeah, I remember her. You always had very discerning taste, Blair. - Hey, you meet my new girlfriend, you gonna change your tune, man. - All right. - All right, man. - I'll see you tonight. - All right, man. - I'll see you tonight. - Take it easy, baby. (Latin music) Hey. Oh, yeah. Look, Mami, get it, get it. (dramatic music) (punch strikes) (head strikes) - Why the fuck you following me? Who the hell are you, huh? I asked you a question. Show me some fucking, ID, show me some fuckin', show me some fuckin' ID. You're cops. What? What'd I do, huh? Am I under investigation? What for, huh? Ah! - [Officer 1] What's wrong with him? - I don't know. - What the fuck you lookin' at, huh? Don't look at me. - You need to work on your foot surveillance, Bill. You both suck. - Aye, son of a bitch. - [Crowd] Upside down, upside down. - We were in Cosmic Park one day, we were looking for this fugitive. He's a bank robber and they have this police dog like walking right back and forth past the guy and he's missing him every time, but Blair with his typical Blair instinct, trips right over the guy. He handcuffs him, right? And then he tells the cop with the dog, "Hey, you, bring Lassie over here." He grabs the dog, no lie, by the neck, picks him up and bites him hard on his leg. Then he says to the dog, "That's how you do it, you stupid piece of shit." (crowd chatters) - Excuse me, pal, only cops tonight. - No, I know. I'm here to meet Detective Blair Valdez. - Oh, you're friends with Blair? - Yeah. - Oh, come on in. (crowd chatters) - Excuse me. Excuse me. Blair, Blair, hey. - Hey, Professor, come here. Hey, you guys, listen, listen, listen. This here is my oldest, most intelligent dearest friend, it's Ethan. He's a professor of criminology. - Hi. - And this is his teenage daughter. - [Ethan] This is Maria. (crowd chatters) All right, this here is my partner Richie. - How you doin'? - How do you do? - This is Detective Valerie Jenkins. Best criminal investigator in New York City. - You damn right and don't you forget it, boy. Nice to meet you. - How do you do. - How you doin'? - And this, this is Izabel, my queen. The most precious, beautiful, no, no, I gotta say it. I mean, look at this lady. She's so classy, I don't know what she's doing with a knucklehead like me. Must be the big gun. - [Colleague] Little peashooter. - Yeah, right. - Straight from underneath the 42nd Street Theater. You can't see this. Hold on, hold on, we got Joan. Ow! (pumping techno music) - [Colleague 2] Yeah, baby. - Go ahead man. Hit the belt, hit the belt. Hey, listen, won't you get out there and dance. - Absolutely not. - I kinda wanna dance if it's okay. - Listen, this is not school. You don't have to ask my permission, okay? Just realize it's getting kind of rough out there. - [Maria] Please, please, just one dance. - [Ethan] Dance with someone else. - [Maria] Please, please. - Blair, you dance with her. - [Maria] Is that okay? - Go ahead. - [Blair] Hey. - [Maria] Keep an eye on my bag, would you? (upbeat club music) (guests chattering) - Hands in the air. ♪ Clap your hands, stomp your feet ♪ ♪ On nights like this ♪ ♪ Come on down and party ♪ ♪ Nights like this ♪ ♪ Move your body ♪ ♪ Nights like this ♪ ♪ Nights like this ♪ - Don't, hey. Get off of me. Will you stop, stop, stop. Just please stop. It hurts. Get your hands off me. Get your hands off me. - Hey, hey, hey, no, no, no, no, that's my friend's lady, man. - I don't give a fuck who she is. - Blair. - Don't disrespect me friend's woman you fat fuck. - Come on, Blair. - Who you calling a fat fuck? (punches striking) - [Blair] Bitch. (punches striking) - All right, that's enough, psycho cops. Stay. Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah. I'm having a fantastic time. Nobody's ever fought over me before, it's great. - [Valerie] Good for you. - Do you mind? You're incorrigible. - I think I left my lipstick on the table. I'll be right back. - We got a call from downtown, big boy, we gotta go. - Hey, hey, hey, Professor. Do you mind taking the queen home for me? - No, yeah, it's okay. - Come on, come on, come on. What I want you to do, I want you to drive her home, walk her to her door, say something nice about me to her, okay? - All right. - All right? - Yeah, I can do that. - Baby, how late you gonna be up? - Three? - Three? I'm coming over. Aight. - Be careful. (door close) - [Richie] Hey, boss, what's up? - [Boss] Listen, Richie, our friends are gonna try another box tonight. You set up at 26 and Broadway, okay? - Be there in 10 minutes. (dramatic music) - Shit. - What? - That's those motherfuckers right there. The guys I beat up. - [Richie] Jesus, they know. - How would they know, man, they don't know. - Fuck. Fuck, man. Somebody noticed we're spending too much money. Either that or I'm telling you somebody stabbed us in the back, somebody close. How about Izabel? - Are you fuckin' crazy, man? Izabel does not know shit, Richie. And even if she knew shit, it wouldn't be to her benefit to say anything, man. - Let me ask you something. How do you know she is who she says she is, huh? And how do you know she hasn't turned a copy of the corporate papers to Internal Affairs? Anybody could be anybody. - Hey! Richie! No more shit about Izabel, man. She means a lot to me. - Just check, will you man. - Okay? - [Maria] Shoot. I think I left my lipstick there at that bar. It's weird, it was right in my bag. I didn't even take it out. - [Ethan] Well, maybe you left it at home. - I don't think so. Anyway, so how does a college professor end up being such good friends with a police detective? - Well, we worked together for about a year. - [Maria] What kind of work? - Just police work. - Police work, like what, you were a consultant on how the criminal mind works? - No, actually I was a cop. - You were a cop (laughs)? You're kidding. - Well, I only did it for a little while. I wasn't very good at it. Blair, on the other hand, he was a natural. He was a great talent. I mean, he is a great talent. - I wonder if it's more fun having sex with a cop. You know, if they're more out there. (officer yawns) - Why don't they just go home? I gotta tell you something, man, all right? This whole thing is makin' me fuckin' nuts. I don't like sittin' around waitin' for the fuckin' hammer to fall, okay. If I go to jail, what am I gonna tell the kids, huh? (engine revs) This is a fuckin' catastrophe, all right? This is a fuckin'. You know what happens to cops in jail. - Hey, Richie, Richie. Look at me. Richie, look at me, man. You're not thinking of talking to these motherfuckers, right? - Fuck, man, what are you talking about? No, man, you're my fuckin' partner. - I'm just fuckin' with you, man. You're making me crazy with this paranoia shit, man. - We're fuckin' partners. - Cool that shit, man. - We're fuckin' partners. Till death, right? (traffic rustling) (engine revs) (truck beeps) (tires squeal) - Man, man, Richie, Richie. - Huh, what? - He's over there. He's going down there. - We need some backup, man. These guys are fuckin' dressed for war. - By the time backup gets here, these motherfuckers are gonna be gone. - [Richie] Let me get backup, man. They're nuts, man. Dispatch, we got a 1013 on 26 and Broadway. (bricks crash) I'll take the front, you take the side. - Hold on! (alarm blaring) - [Robber] Go ahead, go ahead, do it. - Police, freeze! Back away slowly. Hey, you in the truck, stop, stop! (guns fire) Richie! Richie! - Ah! (guns fire) - Ah! - Ah! (car crashes) - Get it. (alarm blares) (Richie breathes heavily) (gentle jazz music) - What are you doing? - I was just checking on something. I need a copy of the corporate papers. - Well, if you need something, you ask me. You don't just go rifling through my things. - Hey, hey, wait a minute. Now you was asleep, all right? I didn't wanna wake you. I figured if I waited till tomorrow, I might forget about it. - Forget about what? Look, I've given you a key to my apartment because I trust you. That does not mean that you take control of my life. - Okay, my bad. Okay? (water bubbles) - Is there something wrong? - [Blair] Yes. - What's wrong? - You haven't danced with me all night, have you? Huh? Have you? Don't smile at me, have you danced with me, yes or no, you haven't. - Well, see, I can't dance. - Come here, come here. - No, you're gonna step on my toe. I hate you. - Look at her. - No. - Mm-mm, don't run away. - I don't wanna look in the mirror. - Would you stop it. - Look at her. Now look at her, look at her. - Would you stop. - (speaks foreign language), look right there, (speaks foreign language). - I just woke up, stop it. - Wait a minute, what's going on? - No. - Look, look at that. Look at that right there. - No. - Look at that right there. - No. - Is he touching you? Is he touching you? - Stop. - Stop, okay. Oh, look at that. - All right, stop. - You like that. Hey. (sultry music) - [Izabel] No, Blair, please. (Izabel moans) - Yay on today. - [Blair] Hey, Papi, you know what? I'm a call the DA when I'm ready to call. - I know you will. - Okay? - Question is when the heck's that gonna be. - You ain't super cop yet, baby. - I'm working on it. - Where's Captain Starr? I'm Captain Moore with Internal Affairs. - Rat squad. - Excuse me, ma'am, yes. Let me put you on hold. Oh, shit. Somebody is really fucked. Damn. Boy, oh, boy, I'll tell you one thing. I hope it's not me. - Richie! Get in here. - Richie. You want me to call a union rep for you, man? - Man, Richie, it's a mind fuck, baby. You know if they had anything, they'd be flashing cuffs, man. - What's going on, Blair. - I'll tell you what's going on, baby. You and me. - Mm, mm, mm. The IAD ain't joking. Come on, man, you playin', they serious. What's the deal? (slow jazz music) - Valdez. (phone rings) - So what'd I do now, register for the wrong classes, huh? Tell me, que pasa, what's up, huh? Oh, hey, brother, how you doin', you all right? - My name is Captain Phillip Moore. I'm with Internal Affairs Division. I have a letter of notice of discipline for you. You'll be required to report to IAD headquarters on Henry Street, 9 a.m. this Monday morning for custodial interrogation. You will bring your gun, your handcuffs and your shield with you, as well as your memo book. Now you're advised that Miranda warning are under effect and you have the right to representation by an attorney. - Since I'm here right now, why don't you, uh, just tell me what this is about. - You will be informed Monday as to the subject of the interrogation. - What's so funny? - It's just that Monday, um, Mondays are gonna be a difficult day. I'm expecting a little bad news from my doctor. I've been having these pains and I guess the cosmoses are lining against me and, uh- - Monday. Have a nice weekend. (phone rings) - Okay. I got something for you, too, uh, check this out. (crew chatting) Hey, I figured you want this ass so bad, you might as well come on and kiss it. Right, Ray, huh. You mind kissing it? Look at that, look at that. - This man is a psychopath. - I never met a really good cop that wasn't a little crazy. (all laughing) (crew chatting) (seagulls cawing) (phone rings) - Yello? - [Blair] Hey, man, how you doin'? - Hey, Blair, how you doin', man? - [Blair] Listen, man, I got a little problem. - [Ethan] Well, what's the matter? - [Blair] I'll tell you when I see you. Can you meet me in an hour. You know, that place you used to wait for me to pick you up on our way to work. (dramatic music) (tires squeal) - Hey. What's going on? - Listen, man, I'm in deep shit. I need a lawyer. Not that bullshit PBA lawyer. I remember you said your dad is a big time attorney, right? - Right. - Okay. - Can you call him for me, huh? - Well, I mean, well, yeah, I mean, I could, but he retired to Arizona like two years ago. - Fuck. - Well, is there anything else I can do for you? I mean, you need some cash. I got a little dough. You wanna talk about it? You know, sometimes when you talk about it, it kind of puts things in perspective, you know what I mean? What? - Come here. Come here. - What the fuck? What the fuck? - What the fuck are you, man? - Oh, what you think I'm wired? You know what? Fuck you, man. You call me up and you ask me to help you. - Yes, and I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - And this is what you do to me? - Yo, man. - What the fuck? - I'm sorry, I'm losing my fuckin' mind, I'm losing my fuckin' mind, okay? I'm under a lot of pressure here. - Look, I don't know who to trust. I don't know who to trust. - Yeah, well, you know, for what it's worth, Blair, I think you can trust me. - Okay. - Okay? - Okay, okay, I'm sorry. - Jesus Christ. - I'm losing it (laughs). Hey, Paquito, let me take you for a drink. - What? A drink? Come on, have a drink with me, okay? Like old times. - You're gonna buy, right? - I'll buy. - You better be buying. - Come on, man, come with your crazy motherfucker. I'm losing my fuckin' mind, come here, man. (ball strikes) - It's like a business venture and it's this business man, this Turkish guy named Harlan comes to me and he says he wants to open up a little money transferring like a Western Union or some shit, you know, but only if you're an illegal immigrant and you want to send money home to South America or whatever. - Okay, so you're partners with this guy. I mean, you haven't done anything illegal. Cops are allowed to own and operate businesses. Did you get permission? - No, baby, I didn't ask. I mean, they were on my ass already about them college classes, you know? Izabel, she's a sweetheart. She fronted for me, man. It's her name, her name on the papers, on the corporate papers, not mine. - Right. - This fuckin' blows up, she's gonna leave me, man. (ball strikes) - Wait a second, calm down. 'Cause it seems to me like you're just gonna go in Monday morning and they're gonna give you a slap on the wrist for not getting permission and that's it, no big deal. - The reason me and the Turk went wanted me in on the deal in the first place, he wants protection. Keep the cops away. - Keep them away from what? - 99% of the people who use this place, they got a hard-working family, but these other guys, every Saturday these guys come in with bags of money, right? They wanna send their money home, too, but they want to keep it quiet so Social Security or the IRS, you know what I'm saying. Don't want them to know about their deposits. Me and Richie, we'd take 10% off the top, man. - Oh, I see. So what you're telling me is you're laundering money, right. - No. - We're talking drug money here. - Hey. I didn't say nothing about no fuckin' drugs, did I? It's not my business to figure out how this guys makes his money, all right. I need extra. I can't just live off my salary. What I mean about it, though, right, hey, look, man, I don't make a move for three days, I lose everything I got. And I'm a good cop, you know that. - Now, if you've done what you say you've done, there's not a lawyer in New York City that's going to be able to get you a good- - Hey, I'm talking if you were me, right now, fuck up or not, if you were me, what would you do? - Well, now you're talking hypothetically, right? Like if I was writing a crime novel or something like that. - A fuckin' crime novel, what would you do? - Uh, well (laughs). Well, the first thing that you have to do and I'm not suggesting that you do this, okay? The first thing you gotta do is destroy the records right off the bat. The Turk is a problem. He could be put on the witness stand. Richie, I think he's a problem. - Richie's cool. - Hey, you wanna make sure that he doesn't turn you. See, here's the thing. With these kind of situations, you gotta do it all with prejudice, you know what I mean? You gotta, you gotta clean it all up. Leave no loose ends, nothing. Like I said before, I'm not advocating that you do any of this. - I know, it's just hypopurical. - Hypothetical. - Hypo whatever the fuck. (ball strikes) It's fucked up. Could I, could I stay at your place for a couple of days? - My place? - Yeah, if it's okay, just a couple days. I need to get these IA guys off my back. We'll have fun like back in the day, huh? You gotta. - For how long? (door closes) (horns blowing) (slow jazz music) - Hi. I'll take this here. (cash register dings) - Oops, excuse me. - Excuse me. - Hi. - Hey, is that yours? - Yeah, thanks a lot. - You should be more careful, man. - I was just playing. - Sure. - I was. - Hey, thanks for taking the time out your schedule to help me out, huh? - You wanna tell me what's going on? - I'm working on this case. The investigation, the feds are trying to steal it as usual, so break's this weekend, I figure I need a little time off to operate. - These the guys? - Oh, yeah. So why don't we make them think we're gonna have a nice, romantic weekend in Atlantic City. - Sounds like a good idea to me. Is this case? - Very big, feel that, very big. - You are so crude. - [Officer 1] He and his girlfriend are getting on the bus to Atlantic City, should we follow? - [Supervisor] No, that'd be too much overtime for you guys. Let him stew. (doorbell rings) - Paquito. Home sweet home. - Where are you coming from? - Atlantic City and IAD thinks I'm there for the weekend, so baby I am free and clear to put the plan in motion. - What plan? - The, uh, hypocritical plan. - What's for lunch, Red. - Hypo- - I'm hungry as fuck. - Hypo what? If you're really gonna go through with it, not that you should, you gotta make it look totally coincidental. You see, the records have to be damaged like in a natural way, you know, like by a flood or a fire or something like that, which, of course, you just can't conjure up. The important thing is it can't come across as arson, you know? Do you want ham in this? - No, no piggy. Okay, so no arson and then what? - Well, see, I think it's gotta be a by product of something else, like say, for example, some guys wanna rob the Turk's place, they know there's a big deposit on Saturday, so to clear the place, they need to create a diversion. The guys decide that they're gonna use fire as a diversionary tactic for the robbery, but, uh, what do you know, they used too much gasoline. Problem solved. Only you really gotta steal the money to make it look genuine. - You a genius, bro. Who dreamed this shit, bro, huh? A cop and an ex-cop, carrying on like this? You know what? If you were my partner instead of that stupid ass Richie, we'd shut down crime in New York City, man. I'm not playing. - Yeah. - Thanks, man. - Well, I mean, it's nothing compared to what you did for me. I thought about it a lot. When it was going down, you saved me. And I'm gonna try and help you in any way that I can. So what's your next move? (Latin music) - Hey, Professor. I don't know if you're up to it, but I could use a hand right now. - Well, what did you have in mind? - These motherfuckers can be unpredictable, you know, If you wanna roll in with me, be a little backup, I could use it. If not, hey, it's not a problem, stay in the car. - No, I just wonder if you're gonna feel okay about me backing you up. - Hey, man. What happened to you could happen to anyone, Papi, okay. It could happen to me. So if you wanna be down, roll with me. If not, stay here, whatever. - Um, I'm down. I'm down. (Latin music) - What's happening? So what's for lunch. - Are you the shopper? - Yeah. - Well, lunch is not part of the deal. - That's all right. That greasy shit's bad for the heart anyway. Hey, what's happening. - Yo, shopper. They ain't part of the deal either. At your age, that's bad for your heart, too. (girls laughing) - Well, I'm just acknowledging your good taste. - This is bullshit, man. What'd you bring this guy for? - Why you care, man, we wasting time. You gonna show me the merchandise or what, hmm? Before it starts to rain. How much for the Desert Eagle right there? - 1,200. - 1,200. That's a lot of money for a street gun, man. - Go to the gun shot, fill out the forms. You want unmarked, you pay unmarked prices, comprende. - Oh, it's like that, huh? (all laughing) (men speaking Spanish) - Y'all wouldn't be trying to rip us off, would you? - We're thinking of throwing you off the roof. (girls laugh) - Blair, if these guys don't wanna do business. - Oh, you a businessman, huh? You got a reputation to protect. Don't make me have to go file a report with consumer affairs. (upbeat music) (men grunting) - Get out, chill out, get out, man, leave, get out. - I'm throwing you off this fuckin' roof. (both talking over each other) - Hey, hey, come on. Hey, Blair, calm down. - You fucked me up, understand. - Let's get the fuck outta here. - Crazy! - [Ethan] Let's go, man. - You the man, you represent, man. - No, man, you the man. I gotta tell you, man, I haven't felt a rush like that in a long time. - Come on, man. - Oh, shit. - Whoo! - Ah, ah. - Blair? What's the matter. Do you want me to pull over? Do you need me to go to the hospital? What's, what's the matter? - Ah, shit. I was thinking about court, it's bad, it's just bad. - You what? - My nuts, my fuckin' nuts, man. I know this man, he got a, he got cancer on his- - Testicular cancer? - Yeah, yeah. - You know how they cure that shit? They take a needle, they shoot you full of, uh, of female hormones, man. - What? - No joke. He got, he grew titties, man. - What, get the fuck outta town. Shut the fuck up. - I ain't fuckin' lyin', man. - You know, I can think of another explanation for your pain, though. I mean, it be a groin tear or a hernia. Just a little minor surgery, you know, you come in, a little snip and you're done. It'll affect your sex life for a while, of course, but I can't imagine with this kind of pain you could really, you know. - Make a right here, right, right. - [Ethan] Right here. (upbeat music) This place looks so innocuous. - [Blair] Innocu what? - [Ethan] Normal. - [Blair] I told you this place is legit, bro. - Except for the guys who come on Saturday. So Izabel never comes around here, right? - No, man. She never seen this shit. Turk runs everything. Why, you think she knows and she's not letting on she knows? - What? - Hmm? Man, this pain in my nuts is making me crazy. - Right. - She's a hell of a woman, ain't she? - [Ethan] Yeah, she is. - Hey. And fine and smart, man. The kind of woman you dream about. Never think you could be lucky enough to really get with. Sometimes I can't believe it, you know, she, she loves a guy like me. Changed my life, man. (upbeat music) Look at there. - What? - That's him right there. - Who? - That's the Turk, the fat guy. - [Ethan] He doesn't look like tough guy. - [Blair] He ain't tough, he's just a businessman. - [Ethan] He keep all the transaction records here? - Yeah, in the back. Come on. (dog barks) Magnesium powder. Gasoline. Keep the wires exposed. Put the first battery in. Keep on vibrate. (gate rattles) - Geez. - It's done, bro, it's cool. Thank you. - No problem. Are you sure you wanna go through with this? - [Blair] I got no choice with this, man. If the doctor tells me I got six months to live, I can't live those last six months in jail, bro. (gentle music) Ah, oh. - Blair, Blair. Whoa, whoa, whoa, are you okay? Are you all right? - I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm all right. - Well, what's gonna happen if you get one of those attacks while you're driving? What are you gonna do? Come on, come on. Let me at least be your chauffeur, man. I'll be like a car service, come on. - Screw that, man. - I'm not gonna go in, I'm just gonna drive. (upbeat dramatic music) - [Blair] That's the carrier. Loot is in the bag. - [Ethan] How much? - I don't know, 20 or 30 Gs. All right. This is it. You all right? - Uh-huh. - [Blair] Got that beeper number memorized? - Uh, yeah. - Don't blow, dial again. (phone rings) (phone beeps) (dramatic music) Come on, come on, blow the fuck up, let's go. (dramatic music) (office explodes) - [Woman] Oh, my God. (crowd chatters) - Good job, bro. You okay? - I'm good. (doors close) - Where's my gun? - Don't know, I don't know, it's inside somewhere, I don't know. My business burning. My money's burning up. (Harlan coughs) (siren blares) (Blair coughs) - Get away from the fuckin' desk, don't do it. (gun fires) (man speaks foreign language) Stocker man. Don't make me shoot. (gun fires) Shit. (Blair coughs) (helicopter whirs) I fried my fuckin' neck, man. - [Ethan] There's some oil in the kitchen. - Oh, God. Hey, Blair? Did you see how much money was in this bag? This is way more than 20 or 30 grand. - Oh, shit. That's, that's 50 times, that's 100 times more money than I expected, man. This is, they never make deposits over 20 or $30,000, man. At least that's what the fuckin' Turk tells me when I get my cut. - [Ethan] Who's money did you steal? - [Blair] Did you say you? How about we? - Blair? Is this blood? Did somebody get hurt? Did you shoot somebody? - Now why the fuck do you think I went to this trouble to get this fuckin' gun, huh? - I thought you were just gonna scare people. - All right, all right, I scared him to death, okay? This is the fuckin' problem right here, man. - [Ethan] We're in big trouble. - Hey yo, yo, I didn't mean to hurt nobody, Professor, but understand this, man. This is the fuckin' problem. 20 or $30,000 goes missing, you, you charge your money transmitter, man, but this, man. No one's gonna write this shit off without making a big, fancy fuckin' stink. (phone rings) - Yeah, hey, hey, Richie, Richie, listen, man. Now you remember that little problem we're gonna have Monday? Well, I handled that shit. - One second. Honey, there's a muffin, I need to take a tinkle. You stupid fucking schmuck. It was you, wasn't it? - Now, listen, man, that fuckin' Turk, man. He, he was ripping us off, bro. I mean, for every thousand we make, man, he was making 10, 25. - You know who that belonged to? Take a frickin' guess, the Dominican, that's who it belonged to. You just had to steal from the nastiest outfit. - What's going on. - [Richie] The guy probably has a hundred soldiers after our ass as we speak. - How you know that shit, man? - How'd I find out, Turk called me, that's how I found out. Even if they don't know who we are- - [Ethan] How bad is it? - How long did you think it was gonna take them to find out. How could you be so stupid? I'm gonna tell you something else. Our relationship is over, okay, it is over. I'm gonna watch out for my own ass, okay. - No, man, Richie, Richie, wait, Richie, Richie. (gentle music) - [Moore] You've made your case? - [Valerie] Yeah. - Well, who else was here if you've made your case? - We got Fabrizi and Rodriguez. - How come you don't have everyone here? It's a major crime. - [Valerie] Some people are on sick leave and Blair took an annual and he'll be gone for a couple of days and Richie got a call from an informant earlier- - Can you find out where they are right now? - Well, Blair definitely not. I don't know what hotel he's staying in, so I can't get in touch with him, but I can probably get Richie on the phone. (phone rings) - [Richie] Hello. - [Valerie] Hello, Richie, it's Val. I got this IAD guy on my- - No, no, no, no, I don't wanna talk to him, all right. - Wait. - [Richie] Jesus Christ. - Richie. - [Richie] Val, but wait a minute, I don't wanna talk to him. - Don't hang up. - Just give me a second, okay? Fine. Put him on. - Richie. - Captain, what's up? - Well, I'm standing in front of your little money transmitter place. - No, no, no, sir, that's not mine. - What do you think I am, stupid? - Sir, listen to me, please. - You need to come in and talk to me. You got a 20-year beef with us in affairs. Listen, you come clean, you do less than three. We'll put you in a nice, safe place. - [Moore] You understand what I want? - Yes, sir, you want me to give up my partner. - You, squad office tomorrow morning, 11 o'clock. You'll be there, right? Right? - [Richie] I'll be there. (dramatic music) (tires squeal) - Hey, Turk. - Hey, Caron, get in. - I had nothing to do with this, I swear to you. I swear to God. - Get in the car, don't disrespect me with this bullshit, okay. I don't give a fuck if you did or didn't have anything to do with it. Get the fuck in the car. - Hey, take my car. - Get the fuck outta here. Take my money, take whatever you want, please, just don't, don't hurt me, don't hurt me. I am businessman, I am no thief. (bat strikes) - Get the fuck in the fuckin' car. - [Ethan] So we go get Izabel and then what? - [Blair] We gotta hook up with Richie somehow. - [Ethan] And his Dominican? - [Blair] Oh, he's gonna be in our face soon enough, bro. - [Ethan] What do you think she'll do when she finds out? I mean, leaving you is one thing. - [Blair] What makes you think she's gonna leave me? - What? You said she'd leave. - How come you know where you're going, man? - What are you talking about? - How come you know where Izabel lives? You didn't ask me for directions, did you, bro? - Don't you remember? I, I, I took her home last week. I mean, me and Maria took her home. Last week, after that thing at the bar. You asked me to. (Harlan groans) - Help us find the people that took my money, we'll let you go. - I'm not involved. I don't, I don't know. - If it's not you, maybe it's your partner. That woman, where does she live? - Corporate papers say she lives 200 Wall Street. (man speaks foreign language) I'm cooperating, I'm helpful. - [Criminal] Oh, si, si, you've been very helpful. (Harlan screams) - [Blair] Baby, it's me. Listen, some problems have come up at work, so I'm a be by to pick you up in an hour. Now don't talk to anyone until I pick you up, okay? All right, my queen? I'm serious. - Serious. - [Blair] Okay, you go get her. - [Ethan] Why me? - [Blair] In case IAD has the building watched. - [Ethan] Well, what if the Dominicans come and then- - [Blair] Hey, you not bitchin' up on me, are you? - [Dominican] Yo, he said she's blonde and maybe 32, 33, great ass. He's a regular doorman, so he sees her every day. (doorbell rings) - Coming. - Get dressed, we have to go and we gotta go now. - Excuse you. - Could you close the door, please? Could you close the door, please. Thank you. - What's going on? Where's Blair? - He's downstairs in the car. He's going to explain everything, okay? - Well, what are you doing here? - I wish I knew. Could you just go, please? We're really in a hurry. - All right. - Now. - Okay, all right. - Please, thank you. - That's her. Izabel. - Do I know you? - Yeah, you know my brother. - Ow, ow, let go, please, okay, ow, no, no. Hel, help, somebody. - Bitch. What the fuck you doin', huh? (men grunting) You ever touch her again, I'll fuckin' kill you. I'll kill you. Go, go. What took you so fuckin' long? - [Ethan] She wasn't dressed. - What's going on? - Get the license plate number. - We have to get outta here. - Just drive. - [Izabel] Blair, how do they know who I am? Blair, just tell me what's going on. - [Blair] Pull over somewhere safe. - [Izabel] Safe? - The license plate is New York 6051ALK. Yeah, I need the name and the address. There's $500 in it for you, okay? - Lifting little things is one thing, but money laundering. How, how could you get me involved in this? - Baby, baby. How could you do this to me? - Listen, it was a fuck up. - What are you saying? - I'm saying the reason I got involved with the Turk in the first place was to make some money for us, for you. - I have my own money. - And I know that. I can't let you spend that. That ain't right. Sweetie, look, I'm a cop, man. On a cop's salary, those vacations, the gambling, them fancy high class restaurants, that shit adds up, man. - I never said that I had to go to those restaurants or to go on those trips and you know what? You have some nerve committing crimes and telling me that I'm the damn reason for it. - Baby. - No, don't baby me. Listen to me. Listen to me, you used me. You made me put my name on that paperwork, okay? You implicated me. And what, am I your accomplice now? - [Blair] Please, you're making yourself crazy. - [Izabel] No. - It wasn't my idea to burn down the fucking check cashing place. I took some bad fucking advice, okay. - Look, look, this shouldn't come between us. There's no reason for it to come between us, really. - Folks, you know, we really don't have time for this family dispute, you know. - Not right now, okay. Give me a fuckin' minute. I can fix this. - There is nothing to fix. You lied to me and I want you to leave me alone. I don't want you to touch me. - [Blair] No, I can't let you go. - [Izabel] Stop it! - Come on, you're making us crazy, let's go. - Stop. - [Blair] Start the car, Ethan. We're gonna go to his place, we're gonna talk this through. - [Izabel] No, I don't wanna go to his house. - [Blair] We'll work this out. - $2 million? You stole $2 million. - Shh, shh, shh, keep your voices down. Keep your voices down. Look, we got two major problems here, okay? - This can't be happening. - The first one is the problem of physical danger. We've got people that are trying to kill us. Second problem is all three of us are tied into this money laundering thing, not to mention robbery and homicide. - [Izabel] Okay, the first problem will go away if you just give the money back- - Hey, what the fuck? - [Izabel] To the people it belongs to. - Y'all making plans now, huh? I handle that. - Oh, you're gonna handle things like you handled this. - She's got a point about returning the money, Blair. - Hey, what are you two doing? Y'all teaming up against me? Huh, huh? Is there anything else I don't know about the two of you? - Yeah, Blair, we've been getting it on, in the shower, in the subway, on the side, are you out of your mind. - Nobody's taking sides against anybody. We're all stuck in this together. - [Man On Phone] Repeat the line, lives at 2 Surf Street. - [Criminal] Lives at 2 Surf Street? - [Man On Phone] On the water. - [Criminal] That's Brooklyn, Segan, that's right by the lighthouse. - [Izabel] What the hell is he up to? - [Ethan] I don't know. - [Izabel] Something bad, I could smack him. - [Ethan] You gotta ease up on him, if he blows, this is gonna get much worse. - [Izabel] You're pretty scared of him for a guy that used to be a cop. - [Ethan] This has nothing to do with fear. We just gotta keep calm in a situation like this. - [Izabel] A situation like this? - [Ethan] Just don't get emotional. - So what? You're a part-time professor, part-time crook. - [Ethan] What are you talking about? I got dragged into this. - [Richie] Hello. - Hey, hey, Richie, Richie, man, it's me. - [Richie] Why you calling on me- - Hey, no, no, bro, don't hang up, come on, man. - [Richie] Don't even talk to me, man. - It's me, man, we're partners. - [Ethan] Listen, we gotta do this together. - [Richie] Partners ass. - You wanna know how I got involved? I thought I was doing the right thing. - That makes two us. - [Richie] The Dominican, well, I had him man. - [Richie] Forget out about. - No, no, we gotta meet, man. We gotta meet, we gotta look each other in the eye. We gotta stare down this fear. Fear making people do crazy shit, man. - [Richie] I don't wanna hear about it. - People make, look, we gotta get rid of this fear, man, okay? You know that place we used to go fishing last summer? I'll tell you what, I'll meet you there. Okay. - [Richie] You gotta be freakin' kidding me. - I'll see you there, man. How'd she know you were a cop, huh. - I, I don't know. - Why are you disrespecting me like that, huh? - I wasn't. - Listen, just keep your in the house. The Dominican gets here, she's dead. We're dead. She was almost taken and goes to the place the same damn day. You keep her, that's your responsibility, okay? - I will try. - No, don't try. I want you you do it. Tell me you're gonna do it. - I'm gonna do it. Keep your shit up, bro. (engine revs) (door closes) - Hey! - No, no, get your hands off me. Don't touch me. - Look, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay, but this is a fucked situation. All right, now we're just gonna have to tunnel it out. - Do what? - You know, when you're in a tunnel that's collapsing being you, you don't go backwards, you go forward. That's the only way, understand? - Okay, okay, so what's your idea of tunneling it out? Waiting? Waiting for what? - I don't know. I don't know where this is going, okay? - Oh, until you do you're gonna keep me here as your prisoner? - Yes. - Richie! (Blair speaks foreign language) Richie. Richie! Come on out, man. I know you're here, I see your van, baby. Babes, I'm warning you man. You don't fuckin' come out, I'm a have to drink all this beer by myself. (speaks foreign language) I'm your partner, man. Where are you? Hey, I'm the one that's been there for you rain or shine, bro, right? What the fuck you doing over there, man? You taking a piss? I've been taking care of business, baby, look what I got. Heroes, hamon, provolone, those big, big pickles you like so much, man, huh? Cerveza. Come on, Richie, what I gotta do to make you smile, man, huh? - We're in a world of shit here, man. And you're just sitting there like there's nothing wrong, like you're on fucking drugs or something. Hey, hey, baby, I took care of that shit, man. I protected you, man. I burnt the fucker down, not you. No records, baby, they're gone, okay. I know you get crazy, I did it. - What about the two dead guys? - They're fuckin' dead Dominicans. You think the world cares about that? Listen to me, man. The only one that can tie us into this is the Turk. And by now that Dominican done fried his ass, man. Hey, no records, no proof, no witnesses, no case. (Blair speaks foreign language) - What about the Dominican? - I'll go talk to that motherfucker, I'll give him back his money. Okay? Huh? - How much money we talking about? - Papi, two. $2 million. (Blair laughs) - [Richie] You really think we can keep this two mil? - You think I'm bullshitting you, baby. (Blair speaks foreign language) - [Richie] Fuck. I can't believe it. IAD can't touch us, we keep the money, fuck. - Look at that. - Holy mother of God, Jesus. - Fuckin' Richie. Fuckin' Richie. Why you make me do this to you, man. - [Recording] No records, baby, they're gone. - Son of a bitch, huh, you fuckin' bitch. This is your fault. This is your shit, man. This is your responsibility. Huh? Yeah, this is the way you want it. - You think he took off with the money? - Oh, I doubt it. He'd have to be on the run all his life and I don't really think he's that kind of person. - What kind of guy do you think he is? - I don't know anymore. You probably know better than me. - I thought I did. I thought he was a good man. Pretty stupid, huh? What's your excuse? - He needed my help and he was really there for me one time. - I'm hungry. - Yeah, that's the rush. You know what I mean? You see, I have this theory about why McDonald's restaurants are always so close to like amusement parks. See, I think what it is, is that once you get off one of those huge rollercoasters, you're just so happy that you're still alive, you're like ravenously hungry (laughs). I mean, I can fix you something if you'd like. I mean, you us have to come into the kitchen with me, that's all. - Okay. - You did this to your fuckin' self, man. Now you're gonna go in the water, bro. You didn't have to do this. It didn't have to be this way. I gotta open you up so you don't gas up and float on me, man. (water splashes) (pan sizzles) - Mm, it smells good. - Yeah, I can only make three things and that's one of them. - You'll have to give me the recipe. - Sure. (phone rings) That's probably Blair. - Hey. - Hey. - Hello? - Where are you? - Oh, hi, Maria. - [Maria] Hi, you were supposed to be here- - Shit, no, you're right. We did have a date tonight. - [Maria] Yeah, and I've been waiting for you for an hour. - I know, I'm sorry. The problem is I'm running out the door right now. - [Maria] I'm really unhappy. - I know you are, but listen, let me just call you tomorrow. I'll speak to you then, bye. (Izabel screams) (door closes) (tires squeal) - Ethan! - Hang on. Ethan, Ethan! (men speaking foreign language) - [Ethan] What'd you hit me for? - Just hurry up, call the police. Quick! Come on! Look! - Jump down! (guns fire) (Izabel screams) (glass breaks) - The phone, the one in the kitchen, hurry. (gun fires) The phone's dead. Get down. (man screams) (gun fires) - Help! (man groans) - I know. (Izabel screams) - No! - You should stop laying in the dark. - Jesus. You got your fuckin' arms around him, huh? Huh? I think it's real interesting how you supposedly don't know each other, now look at you, all cozy like a fuckin' couple, huh? You on the floor, shut up. - God, I hate you. - You hate me? - Yes, I never wanna see you again. - Shut the fuck up. You want me to give the money back, huh? - Yes. - Would that make you happy? - Yes, happy. (man mumbles) - Here's my cell phone number. I want you to give this to your boss. We'll go set up a meeting and I'll give him back his money, okay. Get the fuck outta here. Get the fuck outta here, go. - I can't believe I'm cleaning up a crime scene. So how'd it go with Richie? - Richie's cool. He knows we're doing the right thing. No loose ends, clean it up with prejudice, just like you said. He can handle that hearing Monday, you know. I wish everything else went as well as it did with Richie. - [Ethan] Thank God. To think, I wanted more excitement in my life. Where is he staying? - A hotel in New Jersey, man. Matter of fact, he's thinking of going fishing. (trunk closes) (Latin music) - What exactly are you feeling so happy about? - You know, I'm happy to be alive. You're not happy to be alive? Got that Dominican in the fucked in the trunk. He's never gonna get laid again. But I will. Huh, huh. Right professor, what you think, huh? Hey, hey, I like this song. Turn this shit up, turn it up. Louder, turn that shit up, that's right. (Latin music) (door closes) - He's insane. You still wanna see where this is going? Huh? - We don't have a choice. (phone rings) (Blair speaks foreign language) Who is he calling? - [Dominican] Where's the rest of my money. - Hey, no, no, no, no, listen. I wanna be a good guy. I wanna give you back your fuckin' money, okay. I just don't wanna get my ass shot off doing it. - I don't wanna show up tomorrow and find out that guy I fucked up was your only son or some shit. Okay, no, no, no, no, I'll tell you what, I'll tell you want I'm gonna do. I wanna see you in broad daylight. - [Dominican] Where? - Under the Brooklyn bridge, you know where Jones Street is? - [Dominican] I'll meet you there. - [Blair] 12 o'clock. And no bullshit, right? - [Dominican] No, bro. - [Blair] You bring one guy. I'll bring one guy, okay? (door closes) - Hey, what are you doing over there? - Oh, my fuckin' girlfriend's dog died, man and fuckin' I wanted to get rid of it before it got to stinky, you know. It's a mess, man. - That's an awful big dog. Was it a great dane? - We're never gonna talk our way out of this. - Fuckin thing shits this big, I can't stand it, man. - Look at him, he's in the electric chair. - Well, actually they don't have the electric chair anymore. It's all done by lethal injection. - Thanks for the good news. - You got this thing wrapped up awful tight. I gotta get outta here. I gotta run. - Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, there's nowhere to go. We gotta tunnel it out, okay. - [Izabel] That's the stupidest thing I ever heard. - [Ethan] What is he doing? (Izabel gasps) - Fuck. Fuck. (dramatic music) - We can't go back to your place. Sure as fuck can't go to mine, man. And we can't go to her fancy ass place either. You got some friends? Come on, nice friendly guy like you? You ain't got no fuckin' friends? - No. - What about, um, what about that little chick that you brought to the party, right, Izabel? The pretty one? What's her name, huh? - Maria. - Maria, that's her, yeah, yeah, what about her, man? Let's go to her place. - I don't wanna involve her in this. - Oh, you don't wanna involve her. We're not gonna involve her in anything. Come on. We're celebrating the completion of her successful business venture. Tomorrow I meet the Dominican at 12, I give him his money. We all go our separate ways, hasta la vista, no hard feelings. It's a party, right? We'll have fun. Let's go there. Let's go there. (singing in foreign language) Hey, what's going on, what's going on? It's a Saturday night, it's a party, right, huh? Those faces. You know what they say? You smile and the world, she smiles with you. Let me see something. See if you can dance, yeah. Look, this chica, she can dance. - Why aren't you dancing with her? - Oh, she don't love me no more. She probably never did. - You're not together anymore? - No, no. - I'm all alone in the world now. No one to love me, no more kisses, the hugs. You know something else, these two we gotta keep our eye on because they're sneaky. They've been together the whole time. - [Maria] Really? - [Blair] Yeah, that's some cold shit. You didn't know that? - That's not true. - You don't have to bullshit us anymore, huh? It's okay, you can say it. It's all right, we're all adults. Matter of fact, come here, come here. I think Maria and I are a better fit. We could be good together, couldn't we, huh? - [Maria] Yeah. - They both can't dance, they could spend their nights reading books. And they're both sneaky. Remember when we first met and she had us dance together. That's just so she could be alone with the professor. - [Maria] Really sneaky. - You know the world would be a better place if we were all just open minded. Got rid of our petty jealousies. - That's enough. - What'd you say? What you said, Professor. Did you say something? You know, he's right, he's right, he's right, it's okay. It's okay. Mm, would you look at that. It's okay, yeah. - I, I. (slow Latin music) - [Blair] Mami, look at this. That dress comes off so easily. - [Maria] Let's see how well your shirt is designed. (Maria moans) - [Blair] Hey, you know what? - [Maria] What. - [Blair] Let's put this mirror to good use, come here. That's it. - [Izabel] Oh, God. - This is sick. (Maria Moans) - Do you want me to close the door? - If he thinks this humiliates me, he's wrong. Did I tell you how Blair and I met? Hmm? - [Ethan] No. - Stupid habit of mine. You saw me do it. I like to steal things. Little things. I hate myself for doing it, I know it's not right. It started when my marriage broke up. Anyway. I got caught one time. Arrested. They... They took me down to the precinct and, um, Blair was there, he fixed everything. I'd never been with a man like him before. I loved his strength. I loved the, I don't know. The way he loved me. (Blair moans) - [Maria] Are you all right? - It's 2 o'clock. We have 10 hours to kill. I suggest that we just and close our eyes and get some sleep. We'll get through this, I promise. - Hey, hey, hey beautiful. How you sleep? Huh, good? Professor, you hungry? Man, I worked up a hell of an appetite last night. Come on, let's go. Vamanos. Let's go, baby. We're late, man, let's go. Aw, shit, man. I forgot my suitcase. Get in the car. Go ahead, get in the car, it's all right, go ahead. In the car, baby. Professor, don't you guys go anywhere without me, okay. I trust you, right. (doors close) (Latin music) Hey, guess what I did? - Hmm? - Forgot my other bag. - Likely story. I know what you're up to. - What? You are trouble. (gentle dramatic music) I'm sorry, baby. All right, let's go. - Where the hell is he? - What's going on, Captain? I was on third base when you called. - Richie is one hour and 45 minutes late. I need you to call him and get him here. (phone rings) - Oh, can that be our little Dominican friend? (Blair speaks foreign language) - Who is this? - Who's this? - Blair, is that you? Is Richie with you, man? - Val, no, Val, Richie, uh, I don't, I don't know where Richie is. Do me a favor and put Richie on the phone, please. - [Blair] But he's not here, Val, he's away. - Away? Well, what the hell are you doing with his cell phone? - Look, you know how Richie is, man, he's always leaving shit behind. - [Moore] What's he saying, huh? - He forgot his cell phone and I thought it was him calling for the phone right now. That's why I answered the phone. - Well, where is he, where's Richie? - I don't know where he is, you know. Tell the truth, Richie got real nervous over this money hearing. I think he left to Canada. Left his family and everything. I told him to relax, there was nothing to worry about. He wasn't listening to me. - So how'd it go with Richie. - [Blair] He's cool man. He knows we're doing the right thing. Clean it up without prejudice, no loose ends. He can handle the hearing Monday. I wish everything else went as well as it did with Richie. Like I said, I try to cool him out, but you know Richie, Mr. Nervous in the Service. Hey, Val, you're breaking up. This battery's dying, I can't hear you. - [Val] Hello, Blair. - Valerie. - Blair. - He hung up. - You know it's funny that when we started investigating your friend we had no hard evidence. We were trying to get him to incriminate himself. So tell me, would he kill his partner? (dramatic music) - Tell me when he's coming back. - Why? - 'Cause I know where this is going and what we need to do. - Okay. - Okay, Professor. Here's you chance to redeem yourself. I want you to take this number, take this phone. You're gonna go down there and make sure everything's cool. You call me, I'll bring the money. - Wait a second, why me? I mean, you're the guy with the gun. These are very angry people. - Why you? 'Cause I trust you baby. This is your big chance to be my point man. And make sure Blair don't get his ass shot off. - Well, what if they shoot me? - Hey, they not gonna shoot you (speaks foreign language). They want their money, right. I got their money. It doesn't benefit them to shoot you. - That's if they're reasonable people, what if they're not? I mean, at least give me a gun. - Motherfucker, are you out your fuckin' mind? Huh? What happened the last time you had a fuckin' gun? What happened? You choked up and got motherfuckers killed, didn't you? What happened to my fuckin' face, huh? You want that to happen again? You wanna sit in this fuckin' car, bullshitting wit Goldilocks while I do the fuckin' hard work. - Hey, hey, hey, man, what about this? Remember this shit, you remember this? Hey, I'll tell you what. You put this little motherfucker right here in your pocket, okay. And you got a change to earn that shit back. Go ahead, go ahead, earn that motherfucker, for real this time. - Who'd you get killed? - Doesn't matter, does it? It shouldn't happen again. Mr. Sensitivity was too fuckin' sensitive to get the dirty work done. Now go and listen. You thinkin' about punkin' out, it's gonna have consequences. Don't fuckin' look at her. Don't fuckin' look at her. (door closes) (dramatic music) - Hey, how you guys doing? (men speaking foreign language) - Where's my money? - It's coming. We just wanna make sure that everybody's in a good mood, that's all. - If you show me my money, I'm in a good mood. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm just gonna take a piece of paper and telephone number out of my pocket. That's all. Nobody's fuckin' with you okay? (man speaks foreign language) Fuck. (phone beeps) (phone rings) - Yeah. Hey (speaks foreign language), you did good, man. Tell them two minutes. Right. Get out the car. - Why? - Get out the fuckin' car. - Why? - Come here. - What? What? - You want this relationship to be over, don't you, huh? Do you? Well, guess what. It's just now over. Get in the trunk. - You are a fucking low life. - You better get in that fuckin' trunk, get in that fuckin trunk. - No, no. - I'm a fuckin' low life? I'm a fuckin' low life, huh? I'm the same low life I was two days ago, aren't I? Same guy you said you loved so much. Same guy who brought excitement to your miserable fuckin' life, right? You know what I think? You know what I think? I think you're working for that bunch. What, are you a little thief or a big thief? Did you caught doing something? Did you get caught, baby? Did you cut a fuckin' deal? Did you cut a fuckin' deal? - Blair. - Are you working for them? - Blair, you belong in a mental hospital. - Tell me, are you working for them? - There is something wrong with you. - There's something wrong with me? - Yes. - Oh, yeah, yeah, well, guess what. You and Ethan did this shit, didn't you? Well, now it's payback time. It's payback time. You set me up. It's fuckin' payback time. - Set you up? We didn't set you up. I didn't even know him two weeks ago. - You didn't know him. Well, you shouldn't have fucked up like you fucked up. Get your ass in that trunk. - [Izabel] No. (tires squeal) (door closes) - Hey! How you doin'? Hell of day, isn't it, huh? (train rattles) What about them fuckin' Yankees, man? Six in a row? It's important for you to know this was a big misunderstanding, all right? And if the Turk had been straight with us, none of this shit would have happened, man. We had no idea this was your money. We'll never disrespect you. It's all there. You got a problem, you know where to find me. Probably good to have a friend on the force, right. Giving my apologies for the inconvenience. (train rattles) - [Dominican] You'll have to replace the bloody ones. - [Blair] Where's the blood? (gun fires) (Dominican groans) (gun fires) - Don't make me shoot you. Don't move. Where is she? (Blair laughs) - Who? She's in the trunk. You ready to go. - Pick up the bag. Pick up the bag. - (laughs) Whoo! You got me, huh? You got me, huh? Huh (laughs)? - Get the keys out and open it now! - Yeah, you got me (speaks Spanish), huh? Yeah, baby, turn my back and you fuckin' stabbed me, didn't you? You pull that fuckin' trigger, you better not miss. Huh? Better not miss. Hey. He got me. - Ethan? - Izabel? (Ethan groans) - You stupid fuck. No fuckin' loyalty. You think this thing with my nuts gonna kill me, huh? You moving in on my territory? You should have killed me while you had the fuckin' chance. Get your doughboy ass in the fuckin' car. Get in the fuckin' car. - Ethan! - [Blair] That was your plan? You and her? You let me ice then Dominicans and then you take a run at me? And you take off by my 2 fuckin' million? Okay, very fuckin' clever. - Where are we going? (Blair groans) - Keep your eyes on the fuckin' road. (dramatic music) - Listen, Blair, I know you think you're dying, so I guess that makes it okay to kill the two people who really care about you, right? Right? - Get out the fuckin' car. Come here, open the trunk. I wanna see your faces. (Izabel coughs) Hey, honey, how you doing? Oh, he was supposed to save you? Big mistake, man. He's better at talkin' shit than doing it, right, Professor? Get over by the water, let's go. Come on, go. So I'm crazy, huh? I need a padded cell. Yeah, you two were trying to set me up all along. You see that shit? - You're out of your fucking mind. - I'm outta my fuckin' mind, am I, huh, am I? Huh, my friend and my lady, right? You fucked me and you fucked yourself. Get over by the water. That's it, baby. Let go of him. Oh, you trying to make me feel good about killing you, huh? You're doing a damn good job. Okay, who wants to die first? - You won't get away with this. Even if they never find us, they're gonna track you down. Maria knows that you left with us. - Maria? Maria's dead you stupid fuck. She had a little accident, stepped in the tub. That's right, you got another one killed. I cleaned it up with prejudice. No one can connect us together, baby. Okay, Professor, you gonna watch her die or you gonna shut your eyes? - I don't wanna die. I'll do whatever you want. I just don't wanna die. Please. - You gonna do whatever I want? - Whatever you want. Whatever, you figure it out. You can put me in a room. You can put me in a cage. Whatever will make you feel safe, just, please, I don't wanna die. I don't wanna die. - Hey, hey, what about this bitch here? What about him. - I don't care about him. He can't take care of me. I'm nothing without you. Please, I don't wanna die. - What do you think, Professor, huh? What do you think? - Both of you make me sick. - None of this would've happened if I didn't love her so much, man. Maybe her mission was to destroy me like that. Like that bitch in the Bible, Delilah, only Sampson's gonna get away with some serious money this motherfuckin' time, right? Okay, you go first. - I'm not gonna beg. - No! (Blair groans) Kill him, kill him, kill him. Kill him, kill him. Yes, kill him, yes, yes, yes. No. No. Yes, yes. Yes! Oh. (somber music) - So, uh, when was the last time that you saw Detective Valdez? About two weeks ago. We were gonna go to Atlantic City for the weekend. - And you didn't? - No, we got into a fight and so when we got there, I changed buses and I came right back. And you haven't seen him since? - No. - Isn't that strange. I understand you two are close. - As I told you, we had a pretty nasty fight. - Really? - Yes, really and he was, he was becoming crazy. - Crazy? - Crazy, yes, he, he even accused me of working for you. I think that's pretty crazy, don't you? Sad, really. I just couldn't take it any longer. - So much so that you are now living with a friend of Detective Valdez, one Ethan Lang. - Is that against the law? - Got it. Okay, bye. Hello. Ethan. How you doing? Detective James. We met at the party, don't you remember. - Oh, yes, that crazy party, how are you? - I'm fine, thank you, that was a crazy party. So, um, really, don't, don't you find it strange that your friend Blair, he would just disappear like that out of nowhere? Also, word in the street is that he stole $2 million and he had two accomplices. That's crazy, but what do you think? - I don't know. - You know, I seem to recall this crazy story that night that night we were at the party. I heard about this guy, this young cop who was a friend of Blair's who won a medal of valor for bravery under fire or something like that, but the rumor was that he didn't actually do any of the shooting himself and they say that Blair probably fixed things for this guy. That wouldn't be you, now would it? - That would be me. - So you owe him, big time? - Absolutely. So how'd it go? - Fine. - You sure? - Yeah. - Good. - What'd you say to them? - Nothing much. - What did you say? - Just the right things. - (laughs) It's a good thing we trust one another.
