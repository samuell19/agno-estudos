[jazz] [jazz] You just made it, we close at noon today. [tires screeching] Does he realize that is a very expensive automotive machine? All the automotive machines here are expensive. We won't park anything less than a Porsche. This is some set of wheels you got here, mister. Strains a little in third, though. Third? You had it in third? In here? Had to, I was doing 70. I'll have your job. [door closing] Nah. You could never afford this Maserati on my salary. One of these days, you're all gonna get fired! [man] Yeah, sure we will! Where are they gonna find three better drivers to work at poverty-level wages, right? [laughing] Yeah. Only good thing about being poor is that it's inexpensive. [laughing] Right. Lock-up time. Yeah! Yo! I don't know about you guys, but I'm going to the auto show tonight before I have to start studying for my finals. Auto show again. I mean, don't you get enough of chrome and rubber around here? It's the fox on the Clenet display, the one with every brick in place. Give it up, Russ, You couldn't light that chick up in a microwave. I haven't turned on my atomic charm yet. [laughing] Atomic? You're running on cold, brother. Three times you hit on her with your best line last night, and three times she put you down faster than the Dow Jones average. Try a younger one, Russ. I bet that model remembers when Eisenhower was president. That's the way I like 'em. To me, a woman becomes interesting at 28 and stays that way for months. [woman on speaker] Louie Thomas. Paging Mr. Louie Thomas. [jazz] [woman on microphone] The Calais Series 2 cabriolet comes in two-passenger or four-passenger models. It's a beauty, isn't it? How much is it, miss? $67,500 plus tax and license. [mysterious music] [woman on speaker] Passengers for flight 9 to Paris may now board at gate 15. Flight 22 nonstop to Rome is now open for boarding at gate 9. [man] It's her. [man] Mmm. Well, now, Norman, now. No, we'll wait till she claims her baggage. But, but we can't just let her 'excape'. Escape, George, the word is escape, not 'excape'. Come on. [woman on speaker] Flight 18 to London is now in its final boarding stages at gate 3. [mysterious music] Grab mine first, and this five's yours. No sweat, Ms. Carney. It's that one. [action music] Wrong bag. It's the wrong bag. [action music] The right bag! Come on. Damn. [action music] Taxi! [action music] [engine starts] [Russ] Oh, is she something, or is she something? You know, if she were black, she'd be beautiful. Didn't help you. [laughing] Oh, wait till you hear her voice. She, she must soak her tongue in honey every morning. [laughing] Good afternoon. [everyone] Good afternoon. I see some of the same smiling faces that have been attending the festivities since we began yesterday. Just goes to show you newcomers what an attractive piece of machinery I've got here. [mysterious music] Hey, look, Norman, there she goes now. We let her get away again, you and I are going to end up picking coffee beans in Ecuador. But this whole thing's been a wild goose 'case'. Chase! The expression is wild goose chase, George. Aw, get off my back, Norman. [action music] [woman on speaker] Miss Angela Santon. Paging Miss Angela Santon, please. [jazz] Now, this magnificent machine was handcrafted by dedicated artisans. In an automated world, nothing is ever handcrafted, [car door closing] unfortunately, today-- Excuse me, miss, but you-- Anita! What-- It's built on a reinforced Lincoln-Mercury chassis, powered by a 351 Cleveland engine with an automatic overdrive. The body is made of hand-formed steel, and I'll be back after a brief intermission, excuse me. [car door closing] Three weeks, Anita, I was worried sick! Barbara, I'm in trouble, big. You've gotta do me a favor. Anything, you know that. Okay, let's go. No, wait, wait, wait. I just want to hear her voice one more time. No, you won't be able to hear anything but the grumbling of my stomach if we don't eat first. Yeah, let's get some junk food. Okay, why not? I mean, I haven't had my daily allowance of nitrites yet today. I mean, heck, it is no fun if it isn't dangerous, right? Good afternoon, Father. This is for a locker in the downtown bus station. In there is a small makeup case. If I'm not back in two days, take that case to San Diego. But where in San Diego? There she is. [action music] [Norman] Not again. [action music] Come on. No, no. Come on! [action music] What a-- Look at the mess! Look at this! Look at all these fries! Oh, for crying out loud. Hey, lady, you dropped your purse! Uh, I was just gonna call you. They were at the airport when I arrived. I couldn't stop to phone. I've been on the run for 36 hours. Tell him it's all taken care of. I did the job, I was gonna bring it to him, honest-- nobody else. I-- I've got it in a safe place. What are you doing? [mysterious music] Miss? Miss... Miss! Watch out for the man-- with eyes-- in back of his head. [mysterious music] [woman on radio] 48 to the main jail, acknowledge. [woman on radio] 38-75, repeat the location and stand by. You found the body? Yeah, who are you? CIA, we're gonna have to ask you some questions. Yeah, in a minute. Now. Take your hands off me, mister, or one of us is gonna end up searching for his teeth. Oh... Fernando, get the priest, huh? Doesn't seem to be a mark on the body. Well, the autopsy will tell the story. Could be poison. Yeah, well, I'm-- Episcopalian, actually. Just say something over her. But I don't know the faith of the deceased, and it wouldn't be, uh, kosher. The Lord's Prayer will do just fine, Father. Uh... [woman on radio] 68-91 to the station, 70-94, clear. If he's Episcopalian, I'm Korean. Huh? I'm Episcopalian. There's not a priest in my church that would be caught dead wearing argyle socks and brown shoes. Now, we may not be the richest religion, but we are the most fashionable. We're gonna have to ask you to come on downtown. We are downtown. To the federal building. We have questions to ask, things to find out, 'excetera'. That's etcetera. This guy a friend of yours? He is now. [George] We're not fooling around here, kids. We're talking murder, we're talking spies, we're talking international complications. Let's try it one more time, hmm? You tell me, and I'll tell you. The government doesn't make deals. That's not what I've heard. We're not criminals. Russell was just trying to return the woman's purse. Yeah, he tries to do the chivalrous thing, and we get in trouble. Okay. Okay, let's start fresh, huh? Right from square one. No rancor, no 'recrinimations'. Recriminations. Have it your way. We're all just buddies, right? [laughing sarcastically] Go on. Ever since the late Anita Carney left Russia, she was being chased by someone who was trying to kill her. Well, that's obvious. But why? She had important information we need. What was the information? I don't know. Then why were you chasing her? We-- we were trying to save her life. Who was trying to kill her? I don't know that either. Where in Russia was she? I-- I haven't the slightest. Why does our government want this information? Look, I-- I was following orders. That's what they all say. It sounds very suspicious to me. Listen, I want you to talk, and I want you to talk fast. I want answers, and I want them now. Who was that woman? What was she doing in Russia? What are you doing here? What are we doing here? [Norman] What's going on here? I can't leave you alone for a minute. Your timing stinks, Norman. I was close to getting something from them. They're a bunch of 'incontepents.' The word's incompetents. Come on. You stay right here, miss. Does anyone have a box of tissues? Uh-- will this help? Thank you. I am about to cry. I have not cried in over seven years. [weeping] This could go on for hours. Oh, please don't. I-- I-- I can handle anything except that. It's-- it's impossible to deal with. She was close to being my best friend... since Jane Lewis got married and moved to Seattle. I mean, we weren't just people that pass in the hallways and shared an elevator. When I went away for the weekends, I trusted her with my plants. I used to feed her cat before it ran away, [weeping] and we used to do each other's nails, and-- now she's dead, and I don't know why. Can we do something to help? No. I've been a comfort to a lot of ladies. Why do you look so familiar? [Fernando] He looks familiar because he's been trying to pick you up for the past two days. You use the most trite clich√©s. I think two of them are in the Bible. Who are you-- one of them? I'm Russ Moran. Uh-- we park cars to pay our way through medical school, and I'm not one of them. He's one of us. I'm Fernando Forzelito. We all live together. I'm Alfred Leon, I'm tall. Ignore him, he's studying dentistry. Well, we all have to be something. Bu--, what's your connection with all this? Oh, I was trying to help your friend when, uh-- when I found her. Thank you. So, what's your name? Makes no difference, we'll never see each other again. Nonsense. We're gonna be talking about this on our 25th anniversary, so we'd better start now, because 25 years go by before you even realize it. So, your place or-- your place? Forget it! I'm going to find out what happened to Anita. Well, uh, we can find out together. We'll go over to your place, we'll drink some white wine, I'll tell you all about me, and you tell me all about Anita. Now, what did she say to you up on that platform? Nothing. The lady's absolutely right. Trust no one. After all, we may be government agents. Heard enough? We're innocent! And if we don't get out of here right away, I'm gonna call my senator in Washington. And if I can wake him up, you guys are gonna be night watchmen in The Cow Palace. What do you think? I think the girl knows more than she's saying, but we can't hold them much longer. Come on. How did you know that was a two-way mirror? Why else would it be there? The CIA may be inept, but they're not subtle. Okay, from now on, we're a team. Or at least until Monday afternoon, when I have to take my anatomy final. Do you sincerely want to help, or is this just an elaborate ploy to try to get me into bed? One challenge at a time, my dear. First, I have to prove my sincerity, then my manhood. [George] Okay, you can go. But don't any of you leave town. We may need you for further questioning. Oral or written? Wise guy. Thank you. Oh... [jazz] You got an oral fixation. You need to quit those things. Cold turkey? Yes, I did. Okay. Good man. [laughing] [woman] You don't even know my name. How about Nancy? How about Barbara? Oh, no, You don't look like a Barbara. Barbaras drink root beer, eat fish, and marry short guys named Sid. You're gonna marry a tall guy named Russ. I'd hate to have your nerve in a tooth. It's not nerve, it's self-confidence, which you're in need of, Nancy. Barbara, Barbara Gibbons. And I prefer older men. I'll get older every year, and by the time you hit 39 and hold, I'll pass you. Stop pushing. You wanna get married in a church, or just want to live together? You're confirming my instincts. I spent my youth marching for peace while you were sneaking into the bathroom to read your father's Playboy. Penthouse. Whatever, the fact is that we're in two different orbits. You're a Penthouse Playboy, and I'm a US News and World Reports. Good-bye. Hey, wait a minute! Where do you think you're going? To the bus depot. But the federales, they told us not to leave town. I'm not, but I need to get-- nothing. You can trust me. I don't trust any man. Sexist!Clown! Hey, look at us, we're communicating. Look, I really appreciate what you tried to do for Anita, but not what you're doing with me, so please go away. All right, let me bring you back to reality, Barbara. Your best friend is dead. You wanna find out why. Now, you can do it yourself and suffer the fate of most do-it-yourselfers, or you can accept our help. And I promise that I won't hit on you-- till after we solve this, of course. She gave me a key to a locker at the bus depot and some very odd instructions. Taxi? Take you anywhere in town for $2.00. With the price of shoes these days, it's cheaper than walking. Come on. Hey, guys, come on, we got a ride! [engine starts] [horn honking] Look, you're gonna have to give me directions, I'm a new driver. All right, look, you go straight down this street, and then when you get to the third traffic light, you hang a right, all right?Right. According to your license, your name is Himmelfarbing. No, no, Himmelfarbing is my partner. See, he owns the cab. Gotta work two jobs today if you want to eat steak. Ah, you know, man cannot live by rice alone. [brake releasing air] It's just a plain makeup case. Lipstick, mascara, mirror... phony beauty marks? What's in the envelope? "If you read this, it means that I am-- "that I am dead. "Use the key for my post-office box "at the downtown terminal. "There should be a check in there. "Take the check and deliver it with the makeup case. "It'll be worth your while. Anita." [tires screeching] [Barbara screaming] You're coming with us. Forget that, you're coming with me. Oh, no, you're coming with me! [suspense music] [action music] [gunshots] [action music] [gunshots] An Asian taxi driver? A little old woman! A phony priest? Why are they after us? They're not after us, boys, they're after you, probably for the key or that makeup case there, neither of which is worth anyone's life. That depends on what's in the post-office box. I wonder if I look as bad as I feel. [disgusted] Oh! [relieved] Oh. How do I look? Like John-Boy on The Waltons. All right, enough of this, come on, we gotta figure out a way of helping you out. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, man. What is this "we" stuff? Getting killed is not a civil right I cherish. Oh, what happened to "one for all and all for one", boys? [Fernando] Paso Robles, man. Include me out with Al. Fernando, who was it who convinced your girlfriend she was having religious hallucinations when she caught you with two-- count 'em, two stewardesses wrestling on our couch? Hey, the man is massaging your guilt complex. The man plays filthy pool. Look, it's not safe for you to go home now. They're probably waiting for you right there. Yeah, they probably have the place staked out right about now, too. Yeah, they're gonna grab you before you can even walk in that door, so my suggestion is-- I see you have the rest of my life mapped out for me. Well, I'm a Virgo, we're compulsive. I'm a Taurus, we make our own decisions. Hey, listen, I'd invite you up to our place, but the chattering of they two would keep you up all night, so let me just tell you one thing-- Hey, hey, man, look, I'm not exactly excited about being a clay pigeon. There's a lot of lonely ladies who haven't yet had the pleasure of my pleasures. It won't work. We'll make it work, I know what women want. Yes, Doctor? Women don't want sex, they just want to be held. Call this protective custody. Hey, here's the bus. [brake releasing air] Uh, hey, listen, I'll see you, guys, in the morning! Yeah, you should live so long. You're a very determined young man. Aries rising. Taurus leaving. Oh, Barbara, you just can't walk out of my life like this. You haven't heard my plan. I can see your plan. I just don't want to let you get away so easy. I've invested too many hours of fantasy on you already. Now, we're gonna have Chinese food. We're gonna stay up all night, we're gonna greet the dawn. We're gonna go to the post office. If you were the last person in San Francisco, I wouldn't eat Chinese food with you. So, do you want the braised shrimp or the shredded pork with your egg rolls? I still don't understand how you persuaded me to come here. You're not as tough as you think you are. [soft music on piano] Are your eyes really that color, or do you dye them? Why are you so intent on this obvious pursuit? A good-looking man with your charm and appeal can have any girl he wants. If I'm so charming, good-looking, and appealing, why are you fighting me? Charming, good-looking men don't appeal to me. The shrimp, please. Oh, and some more hot mustard, thank you. Ew! How can you eat that stuff? The hotter, the better. If it doesn't blow smoke out of your ears, it's mayonnaise. [giggling] [soft music on piano] In '69 and '70, I marched for peace. In '71, it was for Biafra. In '72, it was women's rights. Hmm, a bra-burner. Just toasted them. [giggling] [soft music on piano] In 1973, I worked for The American Indian Movement and marched against bombing Cambodia. In '74 I-- That's a lot of marching. And all you got out of it was sore feet, right? I'm still protesting. Save the Whales and Stop Nuclear Power. You know, the only time I ever marched for anything was in The St. Patrick's Day parade because my father made me, I was 8 years old, and I cried for 5 miles. I march because I'm a patriot. Right or wrong, I love this country, and I'd hate to see it end either with a bang or a whimper. I believe in caring. I believe in people, and caring doesn't mean a thing unless it helps people. [soft music on piano] No one person gave me as much sheer and complete satisfaction as President Nixon. When he resigned. When are people gonna forgive and forget poor Robert M. Nixon? Robert? Tricky Bob. Don't you care about anything? Yeah, at one time, I had some faith in motherhood, apple pie, and the American way. Then came Watergate, artificial coloring, and my mother turned 40, decided she was missing something in life, and ran off with a Venezuelan bus boy. These days, um, I only believe in the here and now, and sometimes I'm not so sure about the here. If you're really as cynical as you're trying to sound, why are you studying medicine? [laughing] That brings us back to helping people. [soft music on piano] May I propose a toast? As long as it's not to us, because as soon as we finish eating, you go your way. [glass breaking] Boy, they sure aren't making crystal the way they used to. Somebody's shooting at us! [action music on piano] [grunting] [crashing piano keys] [glass breaking] Now, lady... why don't you come on-- [teapot whistling] [action music] [coughing] Oh, no, no, no, no. [action music] Are you okay? Oh! [gasping] Hot, hot. Come on, come on. Ugh! Oh, you really shouldn't, oh, my gosh. Come on,come on. This is really... [action music] [soft music on piano] [streetcar bell tinkling] Thank you, this is very nice. I appreciate it. But why did you insist on buying it? It's the perfect symbol for our new relationship. It's new, it's fragile... And plastic. I'm getting sleepy, can't we just sit down and rest somewhere? I'd suggest that we, uh, checked into a motel, but you'd probably break my jaw, wouldn't you? In four places. So I won't suggest we check into a motel. It'd be a lot cheaper than driving around in my car all night. My car only gets about 40 feet to the gallon. [streetcar bell tinkling] [sighing] A motel might be safer. This is a Merchrysler-Benz. I built it myself with a few spare parts from a Chevy, Dodge, and Rambler. There are even some gears from an old Packard. They don't make cars like this any more. [banging door] [laughing] Well, one side is yellow, and the other side is blue. Are you really into paint? No, silly. That's if I get into an accident, there'll be conflicting eyewitness reports. [sighing] [laughing] Here we go again. [banging door] Works like a charm every time. [sirens] [banging dashboard] Don't you have a key? I always lose keys, it's easier this way. [banging dashboard] [engine accelerating] The license plates belong to some car that was dumped in the bay along with its owner about four years ago. [laughs] So every time I get a parking ticket, it goes on the record of some small minor-syndicate thug whose name has already been forgotten. Of course, once I get my MD and go into practice, I'll trade this in for a more sedate vehicle. I mean, who'd have any confidence in a doctor who did house calls in a gruntmobile like this? Come to think of it, who's gonna trust a doctor who makes house calls? [yawning] Am I keeping you awake? Actually, yes. Are you defensive with all men, or-- or is it just me? [giggling] That's a rhetorical question, because the answer's obvious. Oh, somebody once said that a bachelor's a guy who never makes the same mistake once, and I agree. Do you agree? I agree. But on the other hand, there's a lot to be said for marriage. I don't know what it is, but there's-- there's lot. So the guy asked me what my phone number is. Well, I always convert my phone numbers into words. It's easier to remember seven-letter words than seven numbers. So I tell him my number spells out "quickly." He says to me-- I'm hungry. No, no, quickly. My number, quickly. What time is it? Oh, the post office just opened. Uh, no, no, no, you stay here, I'll go in and get whatever it is in the box. I'll be right back. I'll do it. Now, look, you've been sleeping for six hours. I could have stolen the key from your purse and ravaged you in no particular order. Now, you still have the key and your honor intact. And you've no idea how beautiful and desirable you are when you're asleep. Why are you doing this for me? How about because I want to? There must be an ulterior motive. You think everybody that meets you wants to take you to bed? Well, it's just not true. I'm not sure if I like that. I mean, it's terrible to be a sex object. On the other hand, it's... it's terrific to be desirable. Consider yourself terrific. [romantic music] [suspense music] What if she starts screaming? All over America, people scream all the time. Mostly it's just to be heard. Let's move! [suspense music] Let go of me! What are you doing? Let go of her, you--! Knock it off, lady! We're making a movie here. The camera's right over there. No! Now we'll have to shoot all over again. Let go of me! [Barbara screaming] [action music] [romantic music] [funny kettle drum] [romantic music] [action music] [motorbike engine accelerating] Excuse me, uh, miss, did you see-- Shh. Uh, there was an attractive lady in that car, over there, and I was wondering if maybe-- Oh, you must be part of the film company. Are you a star? Huh? Well, they just did the kidnap scene and drove off, but they'll probably come around and shoot it again, 'cause I think I ruined it. They won't give me any trouble, will they? Lady. There's enough trouble to go around for everybody. [Russ] Listen, I have told this story six different times already. She didn't stand me up, she was kidnapped! K-I-D-napped. Oh, uh. O-- okay, okay, listen. You got my number. You call me if you hear anything, all right? Okay, great. Gr-- great. [upset] Great, just great! You know, the major problem with filing missing persons reports is the whereabouts of the police. So what are you gonna do? We're going to the address on that check. Start packing, boys. Well, you know, I always did want to see San Diego. Not me. I got a date with the whole left side of the Stanford cheerleading squad. Well, let me put it to you this way, Fernando. If you don't help me, I'm gonna circulate a rumor to every woman in the Bay Area that you have an ailment curable only by death. [coughing] You wouldn't. No? [screaming] Ladies, women, girls! Beware of Fernando-- [spluttering] Uh-huh, uh-huh. Got it. Well, what's happening? My wife wants me to bring home a loaf of bread. Is that all? And some cream cheese. Oh, and Barbara Gibbons has been kidnapped. Chief, do you have any aspirin? [gasping] I've got some. Industrial strength? No. [engine accelerating] What's this? What does it look like? In this business, things are never what they look like. Please don't do that. It was a gift. If you just tell me what you're looking for, I might be able to help. Your friend stole some very important papers from The Soviet war office. We want them. Who's we? Army intelligence. Which army? United States Army, of course. But the other guys were from the CIA. The klutziest group in Creation. Yeah, a bunch of stumblebums. But wait a minute. I mean, you're all on the same team. No, we're in a different league. Where are you taking me? To an army-air force base north of San Diego. Then we're gonna fly you to Washington. Then I deposit you in The Pentagon. Then I can take my vacation. Think I'll take a cruise this year, maybe to The Caribbean. You ever been on a cruise? Why don't you and the CIA get together and decide who's running the show? I mean, there's no need for kidnapping and guns and tying me up. I have my orders, Miss Gibbons, and those are to take you to army intelligence headquarters, and that's it. Now, you want a bite to eat? It's gonna be a long trip. This van has a 60-gallon fuel capacity, so we won't be stopping. Yes, you will. No, we won't, those are my orders. I don't care what your orders are. I don't have a 60-gallon capacity. [disco music on radio] [bell tinkling] Ain't got no gas, probably not till a week from next Tuesday. Ain't got no diesel either and ain't got no quarter too. Hey, you got a ladies' room? No. Since the local women-libber ladies came through here last month, [giggling] it's a person's room now. It's right around back. [birds singing] [dog barking] I'm 'a wait outside that door for 60 seconds. If you're not out by then, I'm coming in. Is that clear? Yes. You want some air? I got plenty of that. It's about the only thing you can get free these days. No peeking. [door locking] [dog barking] [coin tinkling] [answering machine] If the number you need isn't in your directory, please stay on the line. When the operator answers, give the city and name. [woman on phone] What city, please? Whatever city this is, I want the police. Don't you know where you are? Somewhere south of San Francisco. Well, try 555-2200, and good luck. Thanks. Are you serious? We're going to San Diego, not Tierra del Fuego. I got to look good, right? I heard San Diego produces the best-looking chicks in 11 western states. [answering machine] You've reached the county Police. All our lines are busy now. If you need a police car, please wait or call the operator for informa-- All right, come on out. I-- 30 seconds more? Quickly. He said "quickly." Oh, no. I don't wanna hear any comments. I always travel with him, and that's the way it is. [spluttering] Okay, okay. I used to carry a St. Christopher medal, but when he got demoted to just plain Chris, I decided that nothing was sacred... except for Teddy. [telephone rings] [making fake voice] Hello, Buckingham Palace, Bucky speaking. [with regular voice] Yeah, just hold on, yeah, just a minute. Would you accept a collect call from Barbara? Are you kidding? Just listen and say nothing, I've been kidnapped. I'm in a gas station about 30 miles southern city. Now, we're in a tacky black van and we're-- [man knocking door] I'm coming in. Uh-- please, Russ, hurry. [man] So Superman smiles and says: [laughing] "Yeah, she was surprised, but not nearly as surprised as The Invisible Man was." [laughing] Ain't that a hooter? No. Well, have you heard the one about how Benjamin Franklin invented the electric garter belt? Yeah, I've heard 'em all. [engine accelerating] Well, how about this one about two short stewardesses were on a flight to Pittsburgh and, uh-- [Fernando] You're gonna get us all killed! [Russ] Hey, I know what I'm doing. [Al] Stop playing around. [Fernando] Am I getting pale? I feel like the blood in my face has settled in my toes. Hey, Al, see if you can raise anybody down the coast on the CB, huh? It's too far, and there's too many buildings around us. Well, try anyhow, huh? It's very powerful. All right. Yeah, breaker, breaker, this is Kevin P. calling anyone going south. We need some information. Harvey Mookie here down in Land Hill going nowhere. What's happening? We're looking for a van and a girl with some guys in it. Have you seen anything like that? Matter of fact, they came in to use the facility a while back. Why, just out yonder a way back. It was a pretty girl and two guys with no sense of humor. All right, let's go! [horn honking] [engine accelerating] [Barbara] Are you really army intelligence? [man] 22 years. I'm a lieutenant colonel. When I bring you in, it'll probably mean I'll get my bird. You deserve one. [action music] [gunshot] [tires screeching] [melancholic music] [action music] Hello. We saw your tire blow. Can we be of any assistance? Uh, it's all right, I think we can handle it. Uh! [action music] [funny music] [action music] [men humming] [funny music] [Oriental music] Ah, we meet again, my dear. Would you like a nice cup of tea? [suspense music] [seagulls cawing] Well, what do you think? Yep, it's them, all right. Well, why would they leave it here? That's 'irrevelant'. Uh, the word is irrelevant, George. We get paid for results, not for 'pronounciation'. That's pronunciation. Norman, I swear, one of these days, one of these days, 'whop'! It's whap, George. [engine accelerating] [funny music] [stretching] Auum! I didn't get any sleep last night. Do you want me to drive? No, no, we can't stop now. Why stop? Move over, come on. Oh, here we go again. Take your time. What are you flakes doing? Don't worry, the last time we did this, we only maimed three people, you got the wheel? I got it, I got it, okay. Okay, I got my foot on the accelerator. Ooh, ow, my kidneys. All right. Okay, you got it now? Yeah, I got it, I'm under control. Okay. Whoo-hoo-hoo, thank you! I just finished making a few deals with God. [tires screeching] [engine accelerating] [tires screeching] Whoo, look at it! Hey, Fernando, this is the one. Hey, maybe he saw something. Hi. Um, did you see what happened in that van over there? You are a cop? Do I look like a cop? Do I look like a computer programmer? No. Good. My disguise is working. Yeah, I saw what happened. Two little guys and an Oriental came along in a black limo. Then they whacked those two cats in the van and drove off with as cute a piece of fluff as I ever saw. That other group claimed to be US army intelligence. And you are? FBI. Oh, I don't believe any of this. As you wish. I am being kidnapped by the FBI away from army intelligence, who were trying to make sure I didn't fall in the hands of the CIA? Exactly. They were taking me to an air force base near San Diego. Well, we're only going as far as the federal building in Los Angeles. Uh, you sure? Why don't you guys get together? We're only concerned with the FBI. Military intelligence is hardly intelligent, and the CIA has been in disrepute since The Bay of Pigs. But we-- we had our own TV show. [Russ] Breaker, breaker. This is Bugsy Moran, I'm calling anyone. I'm still looking for that long black limo. Every car with a CB is looking for a long black limo. Somebody named Bugsy Moran is 8 mi behind us and gaining. Stop in Santa Barbara. I got an idea. This Mr. Moran a friend of yours? Would I have a friend named Bugsy? You know, I don't have the plans or the papers or whatever it is you want. I swear I don't. I don't even know what they are. Well, then, you should, Miss Gibbons. You see, The Russians have formulated a military plan of attack on the Middle East for when the oil runs low, and your friend Anita somehow got ahold of those plans. Now, I don't know who she works for. Obviously it wasn't the FBI. Or the CIA or army intelligence. But what has that got to do with me? You are our only link to Anita Carney and those plans and her killers. [suspense music] Electric Cowboy to Bugsy Moran. Long black limo at the car paint store-- 1501 West 20th Street in Santa Barbara. Over. I got it, Cowboy, muchas gracias. That's a big 10-4. Yeah, about six hours to get it dried properly. Well, how long for wet? Wet, are you kidding? I've got four cars ahead of you. No way! Look, mister, there's a nice $200 bonus in it for you if you get this car white instantly and get it out of here in 20 minutes. Cash? Cash. Mister, you got yourself a deal. Later. Come on. You're coming with me. All right, now, we're gonna sit over there for 20 minutes, and I advise you to sit very quietly, and I seriously advise you to mind your own business. You get it? Got it. Keep it. [engine starting] Don't signal them in any way if you know what's good for you. I won't. Fine, because I hate violence. It's so-- it's so. Violent? You got a gift for words. How long have you been with The Bureau? Ever since I saw James Stewart in "The FBI Story." I really identify with James Stewart. That sound strange to you? When I saw "The Black Stallion," I identified with the horse. He is much taller than I am, you know. The horse? Jimmy Stewart. He's taller than the horse. [Fernando] I think we can take 'em. Not with my face we don't. Listen, I've been shot at enough already. What we need is a diversionary tactic. Like what? I'll start a fight with those bikers. While they wipe the floor up with me, you two snatch Barbara. [door slam] [quickly steps] [horn honking] Hey, Helen's Angels. You talking to us? You guys think you're pretty terrific, huh? Why not? Self-esteem is very important. Those outfits, they're a joke. Basically, they're for protection. Some people find that funny. Your mother wore army boots. She still does. She's stationed at Fort Ord, and the whole family's proud. In fact, I have a picture here of her in uniform. Marlon Brando's a sissy! What?! You heard me. I'll accept personal invective, innuendo, and contumely, but don't you dare cast aspersions on Marlon Brando! And the same goes for Peter Fonda! And Jack Nicholson! Yeah? Well, they all ride sidesaddles! What?! [grunting] Get him! [action music] [air pressure released] [everyone shouting] What's happening, brother? Gee, man, that's a bad suit you got on, man. I wish I had one of them. Guys, fight right over there. Go get 'em. [grunting] [everyone shouting] [everyone talking] [engine blasting] [Barbara screaming] [funny music] The army was taking me to Washington, The FBI to Los Angeles-- And I'm taking you to San Francisco. We can't go back now. Anita was killed because she stole something. They think I know what it is, and whoever killed her is looking for me. What did she steal? Some kind of plans. I don't know. It-- What was in the post-office box? Uh, it was an unsigned check from the Jim Joy Toy Company in San Diego, $100,000 made out to cash. I got 60 names in my phone book. There is not one I would go through this for. That man's in trouble. The man is in love. But he's got about as much chance of making the ground move for her as Howard Hughes has of becoming president. Howard Hughes is dead. You got a swift mind, Fernando. Well, you gonna come with me? I have an anatomy final on Monday. Well, that's okay. Commitment is what separates the men from the boys. May I have that check, please? Hey, look. I've risked my life for you, and all I've gotten is lip. I never promised you that much. Now, wait a minute! I've just had about-- Listen, I'd be quite willing to see this thing through to the end, but I really don't know a thing about you. I know about you. You're clumsy. Oh, you're clumsy. I like men with a good sense of humor about themselves. I enjoy debating political issues, and I'll take either side just to have a good verbal bout. And I like all-night vigils in front of various state capitols, clear nail polish, and my steak medium-rare. Enough? No, not nearly. I have to know whether you like Willie Nelson, Thin Lizzy, or Gustav Mahler. If the presidency's the toughest job in the world, why do so many people want it? And why is it, no matter how empty a toothpaste tube is, you can always squeeze out enough for one more brushing? Ah, the important things. Mm, yeah. Do you trust me? I called you, didn't I? Will you let me make a decision? I'll let you make a suggestion. Okay. [tires screeching] I can only take one of you. Uh, no, thanks. We'll wait. This is not your option. It's mine. Get in the car, miss, stay right there. Stay right where you are. I can kill you all in 2.5 seconds. [supense music] I also like men who never give up. [engine accelerating] Never! That's it, no more Mr. Nice Guy. [tires screeching] Hey. Hey, look! Hey, lady! Lady, wait, wait, wait! Hold, hold! Hold it! Hey, listen, do you think you could give us a ride? Do I look like a bus driver, sonny? No, you see, my girlfriend, she was just kidnapped by-- by a Russian spy. Russkies? Here in Santa Barbara? Oh, hop abord. They went thataway. [tires screeching] [everyone screaming] So it's come to this, huh? McCarthy was right. Eugene or Charlie? You just show me which car. That double-barreled shotgun there is loaded for just such an emergency. Now I know who you are. No, you don't. Okay. So, where are you taking me, Russia? Nothing so exotic. Your trip ends in San Diego. And so do you. I'm not going to die in San Diego. Why not? There's nothing else to do in San Diego. They have a great zoo. Is this thing yours? Uh-huh. I have a delivery service. Long as they load and unload, I'll drive anything anywhere. I would have thought you'd be retired. Never. Once you retire, you might just as well lay down and die. When the late mister was still alive, he said to me, "Missus," he said-- my name's Blanche, but he always called me Missus. "Missus," the mister said, "now, I don't want you to be a drain on the community "with welfare and stuff like that. It's for old people." So here I am-- 64, and that's 16 years younger than Fred Astaire, and he's still dancing. So I'm earning my keep, and here I am, and having a wonderful time. Is that them up there at that stop light? [Russ] Yeah! [gun loading] [Blanche] Don't move, my man. Get his gun. Be careful. The safety is off. Wouldn't it be interesting if my finger slipped? Ooh. Get on out. [suspense music] [door closing] Oh! Welcome back into my life. I never give up. We really appreciate this, Blanche. Oh, it's my pleasure. I haven't had so much fun since McGovern lost. No! [Fernando] Uh! Uh, you're-- you're not gonna shoot him, are you? No. I'm gonna wait around here till the local cops arrive. Now, you guys take this car and get going. It's probably stolen anyway-- or at least the license plates are, so you'd better get rid of it as soon as possible. Yes, ma'am. How do you know about a thing like that? You get to be my age, you have a choice of three ways to spend your life, work, sleep, and Kojak reruns. See you in church, citizen. Come on! Hey, lady! Listen, thanks a lot. Here's a little present-- um, a souvenir. Thank you. You watch out. [engine acceleratin] [tires screeching] [funny music] [Russ] Ow, will you watch your legs, Al? They're smack up against my pancreas. [Al] What do you want, man, where am I supposed to put them? The back seats of these cars are designed for to lose-- Just put 'em in your mouth. Barbara's trying to get some sleep. They won't fit. [funny music] [Fernando] I'm so hungry I could eat. [horn honking] [suspense music] [tires screeching] All we want is the girl, so don't use the revolver unless it's absolutely necessary. Fellas, could you let me have-- [Fernando] Sorry, pal. [Al] Sorry, I no habla English. You do like green olives, of course. Black. Oh, but I do like green chili peppers. Well, I like 'em red. We have walked down two aisles and not agreed on one thing. That's wonderful! That way we learn about each other. You teach me, I teach you, and we both expand in the process. Now, if we agreed upon everything, we'd be compatible but bored to death, and that's no way to die. If you come quietly with us, no one will get hurt. Haven't you the decency to give a man one moment of romance? [funny music] Oh! Oh! Somebody's gonna have to pay for all of this! [action music] Oh! Aah! Hey! [Barbara screaming] Get over here, please. They're ruining my store! Come on. Let's get out of here. Come on, get out. [glasses breaking] [crashing noises] All right, you asked for it. Cabbage, 65 cents. Celery, 49 cents. 39 cents. 39. [cash register tinkling] Stop it with the artichokes! 39. 39! Artichokes, 39 cents. 39, 39, 39, 39, 39! [cash register bell tinkling] [action music] [funny music] [action music] If you want to throw something, throw the tortillas. I got 'em for half price. [pouring liquor] For that, full price! [funny music] [cash register bell tinkling] Oh! Come on. Hey, Al! Al, Fernando, come on. [Barbara] Let's go! I'm still hungry. Just a minute. That'll be $371.42. And don't forget to save your receipt for the lucky pi√±ata drawing. [funny music] Hey. Are you talking to us, officer? This your car? Are you serious? How could the four of us fit into a car that small? [liquid agitation] [suspense music] The last time I slept outdoors all night was when I was a Boy Scout. I didn't like it then. The last time I slept outdoors was when my family was evicted. None of us liked it then. Russ, are you sure you know where you're going? Do geese fly south? That's Beverly Hills, and that's the San Fernando Valley. We can catch a bus to San Diego from either side. Yeah, either a bus or a Canadian goose. Okay. Now, how much money do we have left? Um, $9.75. Just enough to buy a $4.00 shirt. You sure about that 9.75? Hey, the rich never know how much they're carrying, but us poor folk always do. Okay, now the problem is, how do we get from here to San Diego on less than $3.00 each? We all take a bus, and we leave the driving to them. Hey, maybe that one will take us downtown. [Al] Hey, yo, yo! Wait up! [Fernando] Over here! [whistling] Hey, look! Hold it! Yeah? Uh, sorry. We thought you were a bus bus. Well, where are you going? San Diego. Well, we're going to Laguna Beach. [man] Come on aboard, it takes forever to get a bus up here. Great, thanks! Come on, come on. You're not gonna believe this. [laughing] Yeah-- I've never seen anything like it. Well, no one will ever be able to replace the King... [everyone] No, that's for sure. But we've been trying to do it, and it got a little slow after a while, so we decided we'd join together, and it's been really successful. [everyone] It sure has, we've been really lucky. It's been really good to us. Did you all actually look like him? Well, two of us did, and then two of us had plastic surgery. I used to look like Ryan O'Neal. This guy used to look like Tatum O'Neal. [everyone] That's for sure. So did he. Well, this has to be the oddest way we've traveled so far. [laughing] But I finally feel safe, let's go. All right, let's go. Okay. [brake releasing air] [engine accelerating] [suspense music] [action music] [brake releasing air] [chuckling] Thank you. Bye-bye! Bye! [everyone speaking] Listen, we really appreciate it. No problem. If you ever make a record, we'll be the first to buy it. Thank you very much, good-bye. [everyone speaking] [horn honking] Bye! Good-bye. Take it easy. Why would they hold a major studio preview in a little town like this? [imitating Elvis] What difference does it make? Let's go over there and see if anybody knows where we can catch a bus to San Diego. Come on, little darlin'. I'm gonna be your teddy bear. [imitating Elvis] That stuff's catchin'. [imitating Elvis voice] Come on. [Russ] Excuse me. I just want to talk to somebody up there. My mother's waiting for me, if you don't... Excuse me, lady with the bag, you know what I mean? Uh, hi, u, what's going on? Jock Higgins is gonna be here himself in actual person! Oh, I see. Um, who's Jock Higgins? Who's Jock Higgins? That's like asking who's Erik Estrada? Who's Erik Estrada? Jock Higgins is only the sexiest, most scrumptious, most unreal specimen of male wonderfulness in the whole world! And he's also in this spy movie they're showing here today-- [car horn honking [women screaming] [men and women shouting] Oh, boy, this is it. [tires screeching] [women screaming] [tires screeching] How's the house, packed, Packed? Full, it's SRO. What's SRO? Just act like we're old friends.What? Listen, I know you're the star of the spy movie, but this is real life, and we're all in danger of being killed unless you get us to San Diego right now. Killed? Yeah. You see those guys over there? They're all killers. Come on. Get us out of here right away. But, why me? I'm just an enormously popular movie star. Uh, listen. Can you lose those four cars in the next 50 miles? I've been waiting for someone to ask me that question all me life, hop in. Well, great. Listen, are you coming with us? Yeah, but what about my fans? They've come here to throw themselves at my feet. Come on, Jock. This is more exciting than your movie. Good experience. Come on, get in. Mr. Higgins? No, darling. Go watch the movie, I hear it's really great. Go on, write me and tell me how it is. [suspense music] [fans screaming] [tires screeching] [gunshot] [Norman] Quit shooting. You're gonna kill a pigeon. [accion music] [tires screeching] I used to drive all the great ones out here, Cooper, Bogart, Gable, not like that ham sandwich in the back. A tower of jelly he is. He even has a stand-in for kissing. That's because his lips quiver too much. Oh, by the way, who's chasing you? Would you believe the CIA, FBI, and army intelligence? Plus one who may be in business for himself. Say again? We don't know who he is. And the worst part of it is, they keep kidnapping me from each other just for personal glory. And I've got to get to San Diego to prove I'm innocent. Well, not to worry. I'll lose 'em. I haven't gone this fast since my big chase scene in "Phantom of the Vatican." Oh, yeah, I remember that one. That's the one with all the nuns on mopeds, yeah. But it wasn't Jock in that car. You saw him get in at the beginning of the chase scene and out again at the end. In between, it was a stunt man. Selena, please. These are obviously tasteful gentlemen. Don't shatter their image of me. Shut up already. [tires screeching] [funny music] [man] Faster, you idiot. We can't let them get away. What right have you got to call me an idiot? What right have you got to call me an idiot, sir. Oh, as long as you explain it. [tires screeching] [china breaking] Aw, you broke my tea set! [funny music] [man] Uh-oh. They're gaining on us. I'll ditch 'em in La Jolla. Hold on. Do you mean we're gonna go faster? I have not yet begun to drive. [funny music] [action music] [tires screeching] [tires screeching] [tires screeching] A car this big is hard to hide, and we're running out of gas. Hold on, kids. [both] Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! [chains clinking] [tires screeching] [jazz] [tires screeching] [Barbara laughing] [man] Well, I guess that's it. End of the line. If I could get my heart out of my mouth, I'd give you a big kiss, Mr... Lockie McGraw. Lockie. Thank you. Is he gonna be all right? I'll bring him to. If you can't, I'll bring himtwomore. Now, how are we gonna get the rest of the way? Wait here. Where are you going? I always wanted to drive one of these big rigs. [laughing] [Russ] Watch your step. [Barbara] Be careful! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! [door slam] [humming] Be careful! [humming] [horn honking] ‚ô™ Come my little rose-- [humming] Ha! Fasten your seat belts. Here we go! [engine acelerating] [action music] [funny trumpets] [action music] All right, everybody out! Come on down. No, no, no. Oh... It's all right, Go ahead, I'll bring him to again. [everyone speaking] Excuse me. Excuse me, sir. Can you direct us to Sartre Street, please? Uh, Sartre Street-- as in Jean-Paul Sartre, the late French philosopher? Yes, do you know where it is? Oh, mais oui, mademoiselle. Well, where? It's that way. Well, we're looking for 416 Sartre Street. Oh, the Jim Joy Toy Company. They make those treacherous war toys. Well, how far is it? Can we walk there from here? Well, you can walk there from anywhere. [trumpets fanfare] No, no, here, over here. Watch it baby, look after that. Take it easy, take it easy! Be careful, okay. Now, watch your hands. Hey, I can make it. Come on. Come on. Let's go. [chuckling] [suspense music] Look, there's a window we can squeeze through. It doesn't make sense that a place with those kind of warnings would leave a window open. I don't like it. Neither do I. Fernando, up you go. Why does the little guy always have to go in first? Come on. [Al] Be careful. [Russ] Be quiet. [Barbara] Here. [Russ] Up you go. [mysterious music] Looks like a government building. Oh, security's tighter in a toy factory. It'd be easier to sneak into Fort Knox than it would be to get the designs for a new doll that burps and wets at the same time. [chuckling] This place is-- Hey, come on. Hey! [mysterious music] [mysterious music] [whispering] Barbara, come on. Hello, welcome, come in, come in. I've been waiting for you. I'm Jim Joy. I understand you have a check you want signed. [Russ] We also have some questions we want answered. Certainly, certainly, welcome, welcome. [buzzing] [both chuckling] That's an oldie but a goodie. Never fails. Why don't you sit down? Thank you. [honking] Ahh! [chuckling] That's-- that's my Silly Seat. I had it built to order, isn't it fun? A regular Disneyland. A regular Disneyland. [chuckling] Listen, if you give me that check, I promise I won't sign it with invisible ink. What's going on here, Mr. Joy? Yeah. Yeah, I've been shot at and kidnapped and almost killed. Did Anita give you this check? We found it in a post-office box after she died. Poor little lamb. She lost her way. Did she say anything or give you anything be-- before she went to that big toy store in the-- sky? Nothing. Except to watch out for the man with the eyes in the back of his head. I wonder what she meant by that. [suspense music] [laughing] [suspense music] This won't hurt a bit. [chime ringing] On this microdot is the Soviet Union's plans to attack The Middle Eastern oil producers. Anita went to Moscow and cracked their vaunted security by, shall we say, using favors other than rubles. You have been harassed by army intelligence, who haven't made an arrest since World War II, and by the CIA, who spend most of their time in front of the Senate Investigating Committee instead of in the field, and the FBI, who've gone careening downhill ever since they ambushed naughty John Dillinger in 1934, and one other man who wanted the information for an entirely different reason. But why did Anita have to be killed? A sad termination to a very lovely creature. I mourn her deeply, but she was going to sell out to one of my competitors. I hope you understand she had to die-- one of the vagaries of a very checkered existence. But that's the toy business for you. [chuckling] Oh, I believe you've met Stan Barton. Yes, we've had that displeasure. It was all mine, I assure you. That little old lady has joined your friend Anita. [mysterious music] Stan's assignment was to get the goodies, but in that, he failed. But all's well that etceteras. Can you tell me why a toy company wants those plans? [chuckling] [Jim Joy] But of course-- for my new video game, Doomsday. A game? All this for a game? Certainement. I had the hardware but not the software. [chuckling] Let me show you. Please. [chuckling] Take a chance. Do you have any concept how much money Scrabble has earned? Or Monopoly? Or Clue? Millions upon millions. What you see on the screen is a war game, very ordinary, with your basic death and destruction, anybody with a modicum of military intelligence could have invented. Woefully inadequate. But with this added information, I've got it licked. [beeping] [electronic pulsing] [explosions] What a winner. Isn't it terrific? [beeping] It's fabulous. I have chills. Whoo! What a winner. [Russ]Winner? Fabulous? You're playing with the destruction of humanity. But that all depends upon how you look at things. By exposing the USSR's plans, I'm doing humanity a great service. The fact that in the doing I'm reaping a great fortune is just adding a financial cherry to an otherwise altruistic ice cream soda. [chuckling] Well, uh, it's been a memorable afternoon, and we really should be going now. You can just forget about that check. I already have. [chuckling] [door closing] [Barbara screaming] [gunshot] I'm not bulletproof. Neither am I, what are you doing? It's no use, Stan. It won't work. That's 2 1/2 inches of steel. You've outlived your usefulness. [laughing] [evil laugh on speaker] [gunshots] [beeping] No, Jim Joy! No! No! Not that! [gunshots] [screaming] [machine gun blasting] [gunshots] [machine gun blasting] [flames hardening] [carnival music] They're not particularly large-caliber bullets-- they're .25s, but enough to kill you. You'll run out of breath before my toys run out of ammunition. [laughing] [shotguns] [action music] One down, four to go. Isn't this fun? Zappo! [Norman] No, I think we should make the arrest because we were there first. But we nabbed her. We would have had her in Washington by now if it wasn't for Ishihara here. I'll have a prune danish, please. Have the cheese. Look, once they step into the country, they're FBI property. Uh, you got any tamales? A nice fresh one, though-- not a soggy one left over from yesterday. Why do you remind me of Jimmy Stewart? [gunshots] [action music] [glasses breaking] My teddy would never turn on me like this. [screaming] [rocket whistling] [screaming] [chuckling] [evil laughing on speaker] [toy crashing] King Kong strikes back! [gunshots] [gunshots] [toy hissing] Aah! [flames hardening] Hey! How old did you say you are? Why? We're not going to get any older, so I just wanted to let you know that when I first saw you... Yeah? I thought, "Here's a young, handsome creep!" Now I just see you as young and handsome, and I trust you. [romantic music] And I'm willing to care about what you believe in. [flames hardening] I say-- I say we flip a coin. There's three different groups here. You got a three-sided coin? Heads we get her, tails she goes with you. If it lands on its side, she leaves with the FBI. Makes sense to me. [action music] [gunshots] Somebody will be around on Monday to pick up your bodies along with the rest of the debris. I bid you a fond farewell and an au revoir. [Jim Joy laughing] What are you talking about? We were the first ones to find her. We had a picture. We were at the airport. We followed her all over the place. Excuse me. Hold it. Hold it! All right, now, listen up. This is the plan. Now, the official report is gonna read that the CIA spotted her, the army intelligence chased her into the corner, and the FBI captured her. That way you all share the credit. [man] Good. Who are you with? Well, that's fine with me. It's the old bureaucratic game of cover your-- pardon the expression-- behind. All right, all right. But what-- what about the plans? By this time, the Russians have three alternatives already, and they're 'obsolute'. Obsolete. Well, I don't know. I'd still like to know who's behind all this. [gunshots] [flames hardening] [Barbara] How do those toys move like that? They're not on extension cords. [Russ] You're right. Hey, listen, I'm gonna try something. You stay down. [action music] [gunshots] [rocket whistling] [action music] [toys turning off] [music slowing down] Is it over? Is it really over? Yeah, yeah, it's over. Calm down. We're safe. How'd you do it? Well, Barbara pointed out that the toys didn't have any extension cords, so I figured they must have been radio-controlled and running off the building's electrical current. Of course. That's something every child knows from his first toy. [everyone] Batteries are never included. [chuckling] [funny music] Hey, Jim Joy! Hi, Abigail. Boy, he's really a weirdo. I bet he could tell you who locked that place up. Hey, Jimjoy, why don't you come over here and help these government agents? Hey... Hey, wait a minute. You owe me for that tamale! You can rest assured, Mr. Moran, that the government's gonna take care of the loss of your car. Oh, yeah. Just send us a bill. Here's my card. Sure. Thank you. What's gonna happen to Laughing Jim Joy? Charged with two murders, Anita Carney and 'Bart Stanton'. Stan Barton. You see, the toy factory was on the brink of bankruptcy and, well, he hoped that the new war game would help rescue it. Well, it was anticlimatic. Climactic! The word's climactic. And he calls himself a 'granarian'. That's grammarian. 'Granarian'. No, grammarian. There's no such word as 'granarian'. 'Granarian'. Now, look, it's grammarian-- G-R-A-M-M-A-R-I-A-N. [romantic music] [chuckling] Oh, boy, that was good. Now what? Hey, you know, I think we should all go down to Broadway and check out a topless show. I'm only kidding. Nah, nah. I hate comparison shopping. Well, you two guys can do whatever you want to, and I'll meet you around the turn of the century. Barbara and I are moving in together. What? First I've heard of it. I'll do nothing of the sort-- without a formal request. Mr. Forzelito? Excuse me, my little lotus blossom. [sighing] Ms. Gibbons, Mr. Moran respectfully requests the presence of your body in his pad. Absolutely not. The answer was no. Did she say that? After all we've been through? You move in with me. [romantic music] Young lady, if you think that's the kind of medical student I am, you go right to the head of the class. But I promise you nothing except stimulating conversation, regular arguments, a messy house-- and intermittent sex until we get married. No man could ask for less. By the power vested in me by the state of California, the city of San Francisco, I now pronounce you consenting adults. Mazel tov. [chuckling] [romantic music] [romantic music]
