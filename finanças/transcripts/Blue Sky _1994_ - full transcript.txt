- What's down there? - Probably just whales, sir. - Take it down. - But, sir... - Take it down! - Yes, Major Marshall. Uh, sir, isn't that your...? Yeah. Beautiful, isn't she? Daddy! Major Marshall! Oh, shit. B44682, Bradford. B11567, Hall. Major. Over here. - What are you gonna do about your wife? - Is the colonel concerned about my wife? She's a disgrace to the army, and she's endangering your job. My job is to evaluate radiation hazards to US Army personnel. My wife's not in the army. Concern yourself with the men who are, not the mammaries of women who aren't. That's close to insubordination. It'll be noted, along with all the other incidents. - Very good, sir. - Don't make any waves. I don't like them. Very good, sir. The guest officers from NATO are visiting, sir. Caro! Caro! Hello, baby. Oh! This is Yves. Yves is from France. This is my husband. Bonjour, Major. You have a very lovely home and a very beautiful mademoiselle. Thank you. I'm glad you have a chance to see the average American housewife. Gentlemen, I think we must go now and prepare for dinner. - No! Don't go! - Settorita. - Make them stay. - Please stay. - Really, we must go. - Davvero, s?. - Bonsoir, Major. Enchant?. - Bonsoir. - Hasta la vista. - Hasta la vista! - Au revoir! - Auf wiedersehen. Arrivederci! - Ciao. - Ciao! Au revoir! Ciao! Why you want to spoil my party? You went too far today. Half the people on this base saw you at the beach. Oh, Jesus Christ! Brigitte Bardot strips for millions, she's a goddess. - I sunbathe topless, and I'm a scandal. - You're not Brigitte Bardot, remember? What's the matter? I don't make you happy? Have a drink, you'll feel better. Feel better if I didn't have to worry about you screwin' around. I've been good for two years. That's not what it seemed like this afternoon. I've got a severe radiation leak on site. The Colonel is looking for any excuse to discredit me. Ooh! I sure gave him two good ones today, didn't I? Well, yes, you did. - Where are the children? - At the cinema, mi amore. Well, pack up your old kitbag, pal. You're Alabamy bound. Don't worry about it. I'm tired of paradise. You know, this transfer didn't come outta nowhere. Anwalt was not happy you filed that report with the AEC. Neither was I, but so it goes in this man's army. Carly's from somewhere down South, isn't she? Yes. Virginia. Well, maybe she'd be a little... happier closer to home. She ran away from home, Bob. She likes paradise. - Mom'll never be here. - Yes, of course she will. It's her, Dad. Well... What do you think? Of course you'll make new friends, honey. You always do. As soon as we get there, we'll go lookin' for the most beautiful Southern belle doll. Maybe we'll find a Scarlett O'Hara. - She's too old for dolls. - I am not. Not everybody spends every waking minute buried in a book. It's good to read. Alex might just wind up a... famous writer like Aunt Gail. She's not famous. She writes obituaries for her church bulletin. I got a good feeling about Fort Matthews. I think we're going to be very happy here. # Cos I'm goin' to Alabama with a banjo on my knee I don't think I got the words right. # Camptown ladies sing this song # Doo-dah, doo-dah # Camptown racetrack's five miles long # Oh, doo-dah day # Gwine to run all night... night # Gwine to run all day # Bet my money on a bobtailed nag - Come on, girls. - # All the doo-dah day No, it's not "All the doo-dah day". It's "Somebody bet on the bay". # Gwine to run all night # Gwine to run all day # Bet my money on a bobtailed nag # Somebody bet on the bay Come on, girls. # Oh, I wished I was in the land of cotton # Old times there are not forgotten # Look away! Look away! Look away! # Dixieland # Oh, I wished I was in Dixie # nwny... God, what a dump. Is this the best we could do? We have lived in worse, and your mother has always made it your home. Oh, they had cats! We'll have this place in A-number-one condition... in no time at all. Our own furniture ain't gonna be here for six weeks, Hank. What are we gonna do? Mom, why don't you help us make the beds? No. You girls do it, OK? You make the beds. - First dibs on beds. - It's yours. Look at this, Hank. Look at this. It's all clawed to bits. People live like animals and leave their shit for everybody else to take care of! Carly, you're tired. You're exhausted. Why don't you lie down? It's starting again. I'm not gonna live here, Hank! I hate this place! Cut it out! You're a big girl! This is not the end of the world! No, it's just the same goddamn world that we had in Washington, only it's worse! Look. Everything that was on the right is on the left. Right and left and right and left and right and left! Only it's worse, cos we're all ten years older! These rooms are smaller! Ohh! Move this thing outta here, Hank! I want you to move this outta here! Move this out of here! Move this out of here! Carly, it's OK. We were OK in Germany. We were OK in Washington. We're gonna be OK in Alabama. - Don't talk to me! Don't talk to me! - Well, stop it! Stop it right now! Stop! No! I'm not gonna live here! I won't live in this fleabag! Carly! Carly! Where the hell are you goin'? Carly! - Get outta the Jeep. Get outta the Jeep! - Yes, sir! - I hate you! - Carly! I hate you! I hate you! Agh! Ooh! - Well... - May I help you? I've had 18 years of shit boxes. Packing and movin'. New neighbours and ugly bases and... Now this cat piss. Have you seen that place? Are you OK, dear? - You get outta here! - I'll handle this. - I hope so. - Get him out of here! Carly. Nobody's gonna hurt you. Don't you touch me. Don't you touch me. I wouldn't let anybody hurt you. I can see it! I can see that radiation that's comin' off you! No. No! You get your goddamn contaminated hands off me! Carly. Do you trust me? Do you think I know you? Do you? Hm? Well, listen to me, then. You have nothing to be afraid of. Do you want to go home? Hm? So come on. Let's go home. Come on. Come on. Come on. The car! Is she OK? - What happened? - Mom's fine. She's... tired. She needs a little rest, that's all. - Do you still love me, Daddy? - Mm-hm. - Do you still love me? - Oh, yeah. - Do you love me? - Yes. - Do you love me? - Yes, I do. - Do you love me? - Yes, yes. - Do you love me? - Oh. - Do you love me? - Yes. She's got to see somebody. You can't keep playing baby-sitter. Your mom is fine. She's spirited. Sometimes she wears herself out with all the travelling and moving. I can handle her. We can all handle each others' problems. We didn't move just because of the project you're working on. You don't know what proiect I'm working on. You don't know a thing about it. Maybe you and Mom wanna live in your own little world of make-believe and secrets, but we don't. Her famous Aunt Gail we're always hearing about... Alex! Well, you heard Mom yesterday. The most popular girl in Richmond? She grew up on a chicken farm outside of Norfolk. She needs help. She needs help arranging the furniture and unpacking, Miss Freud. Sit down there. The perfect pancake. Perfect. Mine. I know it's hard on you, but your mother loves you. And I know you love her. Through all the ups and... downs, I've realised that what we call love is really the exchange of energy over time. It's simple quantum mechanics. You take water, for example. Sometimes it's water. Sometimes it's ice. Sometimes it's steam or vapour. It's always the same old H20. It only changes its properties. Your mother's like that. She's like water. I made a decision a long time ago just to love her basic properties. Little did I realise I'd gone nuclear fission in that water. Get it? Get it? I made a pun. "I went nuclear fission." It's a pun. You're a riot, Dad. And we both know a lot more about love now. See you later, ladies. - He's blind and she's crazy. - They're perfect for each other. Nobody woke me up. You know I always like to make breakfast the first morning in a new house. How were the beds? OK. I'm sorry. You're always sorry. Well, I guess they add up, don't they? I'm just a... sorry, sorry excuse for a mother. If you say so, Mom. No. You're a good mother. You know, life hands you a lot of surprises, Alex. I guess I must be one of yours. - Morning, sir. - Colonel Johnson? Yes, sir. End of the corridor. Major Henry T Marshall reporting for duty, sir. - Major Marshall. Good to have you here. - Thank you, sir. This is Lieutenant Colonel George Land. Major. We've heard good things about your work. - Thank you, sir. - I'll let you two get down to business. Sit down. Sit down, Major. Did your trip go OK? Your family settling in? - Yes, sir. They're professionals. - OK. Good. Hi, there. I'm Vera Johnson. And on behalf of the Fort Matthews Women's Welcoming Committee, I would like to welcome you to our little community. - Thank you. I'm Carly Marshall. - Mm. Thank you so much. Oh, come in. I'm sorry. You just come right on in. - Oh, what a beautiful doll collection. - Thank you. So, you've been stationed in Hawaii? For two years. The last two years. Have you ever been in Mexico or South America? Yes. See, my father... was in the diplomatic corps, and, of course, we travelled extensively all over the world. When I was growin' up, I don't think I was in the same place for more than six months at a time. Well, the officers' wives, we're doing a show. - Ooh! - It's sort of a musical revue. Do you need any dancers? Thank you. Cream and sugar? No, thank you. You see, we're on point here. We've got a nuclear test programme that's become somethin' of a political football. And I don't like to see us gettin' kicked around. Yes, sir. I appreciate that. If this damn test ban is ratified, Major, you and me are slated to be among the first to get our butts kicked. If the test ban is ratified, we simply abandon atmospheric tests and go underground. Given some of the test results I've seen, I think that's the way to go. Well, I can appreciate that. But we're a team here. We have to present one point of view. You understand, you're a soldier. Yes, sir, I'm a soldier, and my duty is science. We work for the army, not the AEC or Congress or Popular Science. - You understand? - Yes, sir. Good. That'll be all, Major. If I hadn't gotten married, I was going to Hollywood for a screen test. Well, you sure are pretty enough to be in the movies. I took ballet, too. Did I tell you? I just loved gettin' flowers after a performance. Carly, these are just the greatest bunch of gals you'd ever wanna know. Now, they're just all gonna make you feel real at home. Come on. Ladies... help has arrived. - Mom's gonna kill you. - No, she won't. - Let's play a joke on her. - What kind of joke? We'll both lay down on the living-room floor and pretend we're dead or sick. Hello. I'm home. Where's Mom? - I don't know. Probably at the movies. - She didn't leave a note? Actually, school was pretty good. The principal and his custodial staff took turns raping me, while Governor Wallace stood there and watched and welcomed us to Alabama. That's what you'd call Southern hospitality. Oh, Daddy's home. I missed you. I'm glad to see you. Sorry I'm late. Hello, girls! Ta-da! I've decided to become a make-up artist. My face is my easel. You're too fair to wear that dark eye shadow and too young to wear make-up. - I told you. - Wife, I hope you got food in those bags. Oh, I got that, and more. We are gonna have a party tonight. Whoo! Looky here. That, my dear, is for you. Goody. And for my sweet man... To replace the one that was lost in that move to Japan, or Germany, or... Alaska. Thanks, Mom. - Will you teach me? - As soon as you wash your pretty face. A Selmer. Thank you, sweetheart. I've been missing a clarinet. Did you know your daddy worked through college playin' in a band? - My daddy? No. Major Squarehead? - Oh, yeah. I found that in the pawnshop, along with... For Alexandra. It's cos you're so smart, and you see things so clearly, and... - Well, you can be the family historian. - Thank you, Mom. It's got film and flashbulbs and... Well, you just pose us and shoot away. - Mom, what did you get? - I get to make us a... indoor picnic. All right, now we'll see who's hot and who's not. Play us some old bop, Pop. Come on, honey. Dance with me. I'll teach you how. OK? Try this. Everybody! Say "shit". Shit. - Enioy your drink. - Alex. Young ladies do not chew gum in public. I am not a lady. I'm a teenager. - Teenagers keep Wrigley's in business. - Spit it out. Carly. A double vodka martini on the rocks, two Shirley Temples and a bourbon. - So, where's our host? - Right over there. Oh, at ease, Major. This is a party. Colonel Johnson, I'd like you to meet my wife Carly. - Very pleased to meet you. - How do you do, Colonel? - Carly, hi! - Vera, hi. Major Marshall, it's so good to meet you at last. Carly's told me how kind you've been to her. We've been havin' so much fun at rehearsals, haven't we? I'd like you to meet my son Glenn. This is Mrs. Marshall. - Mrs. Marshall, how you doin'? - Rebecca and Alexandra. Your mother says you're goin' to West Point. Yes, ma'am, if they'll have me. Haven't turned down a Johnson in five generations. They'll be lucky to get you. I've always said that Vince was born to command and I was born to demand. - Lucky you two found each other. - Would you two like to play croquet? - Go on. Go on, go play. - OK. You got a real bevy of beauties, Major. I envy you. And you are a flatterer, Colonel. - The kids seem to hit it off real good. - Alex isn't very shy. No. You know, she gets that quality from me. Lord, you should've seen when I was pursuing the major. I just ran him ragged till I finally let him catch me. - Hi, girls. - Hi. - Thought you were goin' to another party. - We are. Mom went over to help Mrs. Johnson with her make-up. - What are you doin'? - Probably stay home and watch TV. Why don't you go check out the teen centre? Cos any place that calls itself a teen centre is probably full of people who can't make friends. In two months, neither of you has brought home a friend. Dad, most of your colleagues around here are dedicated to a programme of armed nuclear destruction. I think they're cretins, and that makes their offspring sub-cretins. If you have a problem with sub-cretins, don't complain. Go and enlighten them. Yeah. Maybe I'll start the first "teens for test ban" club. That should make me real popular here. Run away from home and change your name first. I really appreciate this, Carly. Oh, I like to do it. You always look so stylish. Women like you are the reason that men like women in the first place. Well, a woman's charm is mostly illusion, after all. I suppose we all have to grow old someday. Mm. I just don't think you gotta look bad in the process. I see these... fine little lines in my face. They're called wrinkles. Get used to it now. I look in the mirror sometimes, I see this... old woman lurkin' there, just waitin' to grab me. Oh, I just get so frightened. Oh, you have such an active imagination. I've seen you in those rehearsals. Come on, don't you think that good posture and keepin' fit and keepin' active is all a part of keepin' young, too? Maybe if you're a woodpecker. Welcome to the Fort Matthews Hail and Farewell Dance. - Come on, dance with me. - No. - Yes. - I can't dance. - Yes, you can. - Major! Glad you could make it. This is Ray Stevens from the AEC. Now, I have heard that gentlemen from the AEC are, by rule, much better dancers than military men. Is that true? My husband won't dance. Well, the only time I really enjoyed dancin' was when I was in the service. - That was years ago. - Hm. I suppose it's up to me to uphold the honour of the military on the dance floor. Shall we? You two just... share some atomic secrets or somethin'. - I don't know if I can do this. - Oh, yeah, you can. You'll like it. Whoo! I didn't risk my ass in Guam so some Harvard boy could run us into the toilet. If he can't stand up to the damn Communists, let us do our jobs. The hell with Nevada, we'll use Havana for a test site! I know you're a strong supporter of underground testing. Hell, that's only my stated position in about 30 extremely obscure reports. You guys must be buryin' those reports deeper than the Moscow subway! Do you have any children, Mr. Stevens? Four. I know what you're thinkin'. My eldest daughter wants to form a test-ban club on the base. - Sometimes I feel that way. - Think we oughta join? No. - You sure? - No. Let me have another one. Uh-oh. Here comes the stop sign. - Time to go, Carly. - I wanna stay. This gal's a real dynamo, Major. You harness her energy, we won't need reactors. Come on, Daddy. Dance with me. Time to go. Now. Let's go. Then I'll dance by myself. Now, that is an exceptional woman. No! Something should be done about this. Yeah, well, I can always requisition another one. You're a pig. Whoo! Yeah! Agh! Well, you know, when you're just... sitting around and you're not doing anything, in a moment of time when nothing's happening? Hm? Well, I call that a... a "noment". Ah. And then when it's really hot, and you're too lazy to get up and do anything? Well, I call that a "slowment". "Slowment", huh? What do you call this? - Tongue kiss. - Mm-hm. - People were laughing! - Just cos you never have fun doesn't mean you have to spend your entire life ruining mine. Son of a bitch! - Why's Mom all wet? - She had an accident. Hi, Daddy. Ten hut! - Ten hut! - As you were. - How's it goin', Hank? - Busy, sir. You're gonna be a lot busier. We just got word that some seismologists in Finland have evidence that the Soviets have detonated an above-ground device. The brass must be thrilled we're back in the game. You bet your ass we are. Everything we do from now on becomes that much more vital. They push in a pile of chips, we'd better raise the bet, right? Right. We can maximise our opportunities real quick. Especially you. As of 0800 hours, Friday 4l28, you are TDY at Operations HQ at the Nevada test site in Mercury. To what do I owe this honour, sir? Stevens from the AEC. He was real impressed with you. You got a clean slate to start with this time. I knew Vince Johnson wasn't such a bad guy. - This is a real vote of confidence in... - Carly, do you remember your Bible? Course I remember my Bible. You know Grandpa was a preacher. All right. How did David steal Bathsheba away from her husband? - He bought her a drink. - No, silly. He sent her husband away into battle, where he was killed. Second Samuel, verse 15. - Monsieur, your car's waiting. - Tell him I'll be right... right there. I don't want anything to happen to you. Only thing that ever happens to me is that I just... I miss you too much. Do you really have to be gone for two whole weeks? Yes, I do, baby. That's enough time to convince them to abandon nuclear weapons. Yes, it is. You bet. - Ooh! Daddy? - What? Will you call me every night just before I go to bed? No! Too expensive. Of course I will. - I love you. - Love you, too. Be good. 160mm mortars. About the strength of two hand grenades. Don't worry, though. They're all spent. They used to train Gls back here in the Second World War. - You can't tell anybody about this place. - Never. I like it. I wouldn't wanna live here, but... it's nice. It's private. Let's get hitched and live here for ever. To an army man? They're too weird. Last year, Colonel Harris took his family to Nevada to watch the A-bomb go off. - That was their vacation. - I'm not ashamed of what they're doin'. I mean, the Manhattan Proiect ended the last war. - Maybe Blue Sky'll prevent the next one. - Do you know why they call it Blue Sky? They're gonna detonate the big one underground to track radiation. But you can't... see radiation. You can't feel it or taste it or smell it. So only a handful of people know where it is, and the rest of the country could be swimmin' in the stuff. But for all they know, the sky's just as blue as ever. Yeah, well, what they don't know won't hurt 'em. No wonder West Point snapped you up. And if I married you, I'd end up just like my mom. You know, you talk gibberish sometimes, Alex. - Catch. - No! - What the hell was that? - Manoeuvres don't start for two weeks. Maybe them Cubans sprung a sneak attack. Jesus! Let's get the hell outta here. What in the hell are you doin' here, mister? What do you know? I mean, what's happened in here? - Glenn! - Oh, Alex! Calm down! Calm down! Everything's under control. It's all right. Alex, are you OK? We oughta take him to the hospital. It looks like he needs stitches. - Let's see. - He needs a swift kick in the butt. - Are you hurt? - No. I'd like to apologise for my son. I'm afraid he was off limits with your daughter. Well, boys will be boys. Yeah. I'd like this area secured! Nobody goes in or out! Go on home. Show's over! I wanna know what you were doin' up there. Just what you told me to do: making friends with Glenn. I wanna know exactly what the two of you were doin' up there! What do you mean by "exactly"? Well, was an old grenade the only thing that went on? I can't believe you. You don't care about me. You just wanna know about sex stuff! - Don't you sass me, sister! - I am not your sister! Well, if I had a sister, I would tell her everything! Especially... about boys. Ooh! Boys! Do-do-do-do-do! What are you doing here? I've come to kidnap you and take you to the woods. I left my knife at the bungalow. - Will you come with? - That place is dangerous. - Not any more. My dad had it cleaned up. - If my mom finds out... She's gonna be at rehearsal for hours. Come on. - I've gotta finish up my chores. - All right, but I gotta help. - That's what I'm here for. - OK. Come in. Wait. Come back here. - Come in, Rad Two. Over. - Base station, this is Rad Site Two. Over. Rad Two, hold in place. This underground stun's not like the old days. Look at all this junk. Hell, in Bikini, you could feel the wind from the blast to the atmosphere. Flying particles as big as cornflakes. Coming up on 60 seconds, sir. All cameras, report. Ground cameras, report. Over. Camera one ready. Camera two ready. Camera three ready. - Camera four ready. - Camera five ready. 47, 46, 45, 44, 43... Nuclear underground test number OO1. Clear and counting. All systems green. All safeties are on and ready. All personnel in position and holding. Standing by. Final log position procedure complete. - What the hell is that? - Let's take a peek. 19, 18, 17... Rad Site Two. We have two civilians on horseback heading right toward site. - Punch up a camera on those cowboys. - Base station! We gotta get 'em outta there. Please advise. We cannot detonate! - Abort the test! - It's too late. Detonate. Oh, they did it! It's 15! Radiation's right off the scale. This is Rad Site Two. We have massive radiation in Sector Four. Rad Two, return to base. Rad Two, return to base. - General, we gotta find those guys! - The fox has left the henhouse. We're not talkin' about chickens, sir. We're talkin' about human lives! These things happen. Every TV station, every radio station, every newspaper was notified of this test! They were in the wrong place at the wrong time. I beg the general's pardon, but that is bullshit. Those men have been cooked! There's ways to handle it, Major. We'll be notifying the local medical authorities. - These men'll come in for treatment. - Very good, if they're alive. - Goddamn it, we've gotta keep a lid on it! - There'll be no talk about this. You can't even tell your dog. Back away from the door, Hank. Let's go have a drink. - It's criminal. They should be found. - Right. - No, it's a crime. - Right, they should, but we can't. So forget it. They're exposed. It's too late to do anything for 'em, pal. It's too damn late. Jimmy, I have dedicated my life to counting alpha particles. And beta particles and gamma rays. I monitor radioiodine levels. I calculate isotopic half-lives. Things you can't see or hear or feel. Things unknowable to the common man, who winds up dead as shit. - It's a crime. - Your work's done here. Forget about it. It's a goddamn crime, and I am going to forget precisely nothing. And no one. Fayrene, two more. Bravo! - Good night, ladies! - Good night. - Good night, girls. - I am so hot. - Uh-oh. Here she goes. - Next year we should do Gypsy. Wouldn't our husbands just love that? God, I could never do that. Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. You know, I bet you really could've been in movies. I wanted that. Oh, I really did. You know, sometimes I think... I could just disappear, and no one would ever know I'd been here. That's why we have children. And mine need tuckin' up about now. D'you want a ride? - No. - OK. Night. If the show's as good as the rehearsal, you got a hit. How's Glenn? He's OK. You know, that routine might be a little risqu? for the base. Might... overexcite some of the men. I thought men joined the army lookin' for adventure. You been watchin' too many war movies. I hate war movies. I need your help. Zip me up. You know, zippin' you up is not exactly what I had in mind. No? No. No. Meet me outside. - Maybe this isn't such a good idea. - It's all right. Ahh! Let's go. Let's just go. Oh, my God. - Come on. Let's go. - Get away from me! - Alex, open the door. - I'm gonna tell him. Alex, please! Please what? "Please talk to me" or "Please don't tell Daddy"? You're not even sorry for what you did. You're just afraid of getting caught! That's not true. How could you do this to him? Everybody's gonna find out. If I don't tell him, they're all gonna laugh at him behind his back. I hate you! I'm gonna tell him. When? - Operator. - Long distance, please. - City and the state, please. - Mercury, Nevada. 7458. One moment, please. - AEC, Mercury. - Major Hank Marshall, please. Call for Major Marshall, line one. Line one, Major Marshall. This is Hank Marshall. Hank? Daddy, when are you coming home? Sweetheart, you're gonna have to speak up. I can barely hear you. I have to... I have to tell you something, and it's hard for me to... What is it, baby? I can't hear. After rehearsal tonight, Vince Johnson drove me home. And... I can't hear you. You're gonna have to speak up now, really loud. Wait a minute, I'll try to find a different line. After rehearsal tonight, Vince Johnson drove me home. Vince Johnson drove me home. Just a mistake, Daddy. And... I... I... I can't... - Hi, Daddy! - Hello, baby. She's at the Officers' Club. Tonight's the show. - Oh, Lord. Where is she? - Check the motels. Ah, here she comes. Lock up your husbands, girls. - Hello. - Boy, am I nervous. I just hope I don't trip. Don't worry. We've been practising for weeks. What have you got to be worried about? I'm the one with two left feet. Hey, why don't you come over to my house after the show? - Sounds great. - I could use a break from the kids. Can I talk with you, Vera? Why? Sit down and have a drink and go over the gory details? The things you like to share with friends? People like you come and go, Carly. You mean just one less Christmas card to me. Five minutes, ladies. Can I still do my number? God! Is that all you can think of? All my life, people have told lies about me. Even when I was little, other girls used to make up stories. At least one of 'em's got nice legs. - I need to talk to you. - Later, Marshall. Now. I need to talk to you right now. - This is not the time. - I need to talk to you right fucking now! - If this is a personal... - It's not personal. It's about Blue Sky. Look, I'm not gonna talk about this shit with you now or any other time. All right? 48 hours ago, we irradiated two people in Mercury, Nevada, who are now facing blindness, leukaemia and cancer. - One more word, you're court-martialled. - You don't have the balls. You're just jealous because you can't satisfy... Hank! Oh, God! I just hurt all over. - Maybe we can call it even, Daddy. - I doubt it. We've done too much damage to each other. I'm the one all bandaged up. I can't even imagine what it's gonna look like. I always loved looking at you. I even enjoyed other men looking at you. But you always take everything right over the edge, don't you? It didn't mean anything. You know that. Oh, I know it didn't mean anything. Just like all the other times. It meant a lot to me. I don't know how much longer I can go on. I'm tired. I'm real tired. Gotta go see about the girls. She's gonna be fine. Doctor says she can come home in two days. Lydia, will you take the girls home, please? Go on. Mrs. Marshall, this can't come off for another week, and it'll heal up just fine. In a few weeks you'll need a magnifying glass just to see it. I'm gonna need dark make-up and heavy lisle stockings for the rest of my life. Now, now. You just relax. You've got a visitor coming up. - Who? - I don't know. - Hm. - Brought you some flowers. Vince. Hank's in big trouble. You should know that, Carly. Well, this whole thing doesn't look good for anyone. It's real... messy, and I like to keep a clean base. Besides, I... Well, I feel... personally responsible. We're both responsible. You don't know how much I need him. Nobody understands that. Well, uh... There is one way we could get him out. Maybe. Daddy, I've brought some good news. Vince Johnson has figured out a way to help us out of all of this. He had me sign some papers, to put you in the hospital for just a couple of weeks, just for observation. And then the whole thing is written off to stress. You've had me committed. No! No, it's not as bad as it sounds. It's hardly going to affect your record at all. - Is that what he told you? - Yes. That's what he told me. He also told me that the only other alternative would be a court martial. Court martial is what I wanted. It's my only chance to tell what happened. A court martial would mean eight years in prison, he said. It would mean a dishonourable discharge. No pension, no transfer, no nothing. Darling, this is a setup. We've been set up. - We've orders remanding you to hospital. - Let me see 'em. - This was verbal, from Colonel Johnson. - Get me the Adjutant General's office. Our orders are to remove you from here and remand you to VGH. Get me the Adjutant General's office, then I'll consider moving. Consider this. You either stand up now, or we'll drag your ass out so fast your butt won't say goodbye to your shorts. Do I make myself clear, sir? Major Marshall, which room is he in? - I'm sorry. He's not allowed visitors. - I'm his wife. I'm Mrs. Marshall. Of course I can see him. Mrs. Marshall, there are procedures to be followed in the hospital. How long do those procedures take? - About two weeks. - Two weeks? For what? We are doing everything we possibly can for Major Marshall. Right. And I'm Jackie Kennedy, and flyin' saucers just stole my dog. But I don't wanna see him there. Daddy'll be home soon. It has taken me two weeks to get permission to visit him. Now, he's gonna need a hug from his little baby. Besides, there's nothing to be scared of. He's in a hospital but he's not sick, or anything like that. Besides, we're gonna have a... We're gonna have a picnic. Now... You're not even dressed! Go on, get dressed! I don't wanna be late. You want me to fix your hair? I can do it myself. OK. Daddy likes mayonnaise. Daddy likes a little pepper. Now, everyone here is under temporary sedation, so don't be alarmed. His condition can change instantly. Daddy! I made... Made these for us? Almost. Alex, you go after your sister. Hi, Daddy. I brought you a picnic. I bet you could use some good coffee, huh? Excuse me, ma'am. Oh, damn! He's a nuclear engineer! They got him making wallets. How can they... They?! You! You did this! Stop it! What are you doing? Just wiping off the ice cream. Welcome to Fort Matthews Memorial Day parade. Participating in our Memorial Day parade is the Maxwell Air Force Base drill team. Fort Matthews is under the command of Colonel Vincent P Johnson. Joining the military band, we have the Selma High drum and bugle corps. Today, we are honoured to have local veterans of the First World War on hand. Let's have a big round of applause for our patriotic doughboys. Coming onto the parade ground next is our fine Prattville High marching band, playing "Host of Freedom". They can't do this to Daddy. Mom, what are you doing? You will burn in hell you lying son of a bi'tch! You lying son of a bitch! Do you think craziness is hereditary? I don't know. It's not exactly something we could ask either one of them. Mommy, what are we gonna do? Here's yesterday's mail. There's a letter here for Dad, from Nevada. Daddy! Alex? Alex. Alex, wake up. Becky? Becky, get up. Quickly. Come on, girls, get up. We're goin' on a trip. Hurry up. Pack a bag. Help your sister. Get up! - It's the middle of the night. - We'll beat the traffic. Thank you. Girls, wake up! I got some breakfast. Eat up. Mom, let's stop, please. - No, baby, we're not gonna stop. - We haven't slept in two days. I just can't sleep till I get Daddy home. What are you gonna say? You can't just walk up and say "Hello. My name is Carly Marshall, and you've been contaminated." How about "Howdy, howdy. Sure is nice to meet some real cowboys." - "Didn't think there were any of 'em left." - Maybe they're already dead. Oh, shut up. Hello, there. My wife tells me you're concerned with our health. Well, yes, I am. Of course I am. But mostly it's my husband. You see, he was in a helicopter that day. He saw it. He tried to stop the test, but of course it was too late. - What's done is done. - The army are drugging him and holding him against his will in some mental hospital. But you can help me. How can we do that? I was just hoping that you would come with me to the newspapers. You could tell them just how sick you've been, and how nobody - nobody! - bothered to come by and explain to you what had happened. They would have to understand that my husband's not crazy, not crazy at all. - Don't believe we could do that. - It's true. She's telling you the truth. It ain't our way. We don't like to make a fuss. He's right. Besides, there's another one tomorrow. Tomorrow morning, about 10, 10.30. And we're gonna be out here working. If my government tells me there's no danger, then, by God, I gotta believe 'em. But that... I don't mean to be rude, but that is so stupid. That is just plain stupid. Mom, why don't we go? Take this lady back to the house and tell her goodbye. Come on, sweetie. Good luck. We've got the pilot's letter and we've got Dad's reports. Why don't we go to the newspapers without the cowboys? That's all we really need, isn't it? Mom? Mom? Mom? Alex? Alex, wake up. Alex! Mom's gone. Welcome to our underground bunker. This is our test site today. The tower is used to drill deep enough to place the device securely underground. The cables you see are linked to record every reaction the material may provoke. In this way, we can assure our full strength... and your full safety. Excuse me, General. Who's that? - Not again! - Abort detonation. Get a squad out there immediately. Get off your horse. You're under arrest. Aside from almost blowing yourself sky-high, what the hell were you doin'? General, I am simply trying to get my husband out of a mental hospital. You are well on your way to going there yourself. Did you know that my father is a very prominent businessman? In fact, he owns several television stations back home in Virginia. He has copies of those reports, those classified reports, and if he doesn't hear from me by noon, he'll release 'em to The New York Times. Mrs. Marshall, please. Threats and fantasies don't help. The army knows exactly who you are. I know who you are. And you know my husband. You know that there is not a crazy bone in his body. Not as crazy as his wife. You know, I've been called that all my life. That and a lot worse. And it doesn't bother me in the least. You can tell people whatever you want about me. - Just release my husband. - We're not here to make deals. We can have you arrested on 20 violations and throw away the key. What are you gonna tell those reporters? What are you gonna tell those reporters and their cameras? - I'm their story. - Today's paper is tomorrow's trash... General. General. Mr. Stevens. My husband said that you were a fair man. Won't you help him? Authorities at a nuclear test site in Mercury, Nevada, arrested an unidentified woman this morning, who was attempting to interfere with a scheduled weapons test. Hey, look! That's Mrs. Marshall. That's Mrs. Marshall. Mom, come here! - Mom! - According to the army, the woman was carrying literature linking her to the Communist Party. The army also claimed she is a member of a fundamentalist religious sect. Officials refuse to disclose the identity... The goddamn bitch. The test has been postponed due to weather conditions. Also in the news, members of the... Ben, this is the game plan. Prepare discharge papers for Marshall right away. We could be in deep shit. What are you doin', Dad? I've got to go to the base. You're gonna discharge Major Marshall? You said he was dangerous. You said he was crazy, he was mentally ill. He is. But it's a little more complicated than that, Glenn. - Look, it's a military matter. OK? - I thought this was a matter of justice. That's what I told Alex when she said her dad was framed. I've got to go. This doesn't concern you, son. I used to be proud when you called me your son. I mean, all my life you've lectured me about honour and justice and the Johnson tradition. I believed all that. Those words lost their meaning for your father a while ago. This is a personal war between a man and a woman that he wanted to screw. It's as simple as that, Glenn. - Just get me out of here. - Glenn! Dr. Vankay is waiting for you, Colonel. - Vince. - Ben. Is everything OK? - What are you doing here, George? - Order of General Nieremberg. To do what? To provide for the safe treatment and the discharge of Hank Marshall. I was also ordered to relieve you as commanding officer, pending further orders. Effective immediately. You just sleep, babies. What's wrong? My leg fell asleep. We've been drivin' for two days. I wanted to get here as fast as I could. I didn't know if you would be waiting. Next base, I'll be different, I promise. There won't be a next base. I've quit the army. Oh, the girls are gonna be real... happy to hear that. What about you, Mrs. Marshall? Are you happy? Only if you still want me. Come here. Aren't you going to find teaching to be a bit tame? When I was in Nevada, I decided I could no longer contribute to nuclear warfare. I think that university is a fine place to twist innocent young minds over to my point of view. Don't you agree? Can you see Mom as a professor's wife? It is California. Maybe things are a little looser there. - I want a shot of you and Glenn. - What? I want a shot of you and Glenn. Well, come on. Get closer. Closer. Wow! - What a great car! - Great car, Mom. What are you doing? We're goin' to California. We can't drive up to the Brown Derby in that old jalopy. I liked that old jalopy. Now, nobody has said anything about my hair. You look like Elizabeth Taylor. There. You have said the secret word, and you qualify for a ride in my new convertible. Come on, sweet boy. Well, let's go. Come on, Daddy. You drive.
