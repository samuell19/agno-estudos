It feels so spooky here at night. I feel rather uncomfortable. Whose idea was it to hold the courage test here? What if ghosts appear? Isn't it too late to say that? "Don't turn your head on the stairs." It's meant to scare the juniors. -You believe it? -It seems real! -How did the girl die? -She was killed. -Bullshit. -Hush! It's starting. Attention please, juniors. This year, the courage test will be held at Tung Hu's forbidden spot, the Female Ghost Bridge. You guys will be starting from here. When you hear the bell, take off the red cloth and circle around the lake. Go. Please do remember. No matter what happens, never turn your head on the stairs. -One, two. -What is he doing? -Why is he counting? -Three. -We agreed not to count. -Four, five. -Let him count. -Six. -It's more exciting. -Seven, eight. -No, we can't do that. -Nine. -Wen-yao, stop counting! -Wen-yao! -Ten, eleven, twelve. -Wen-yao! Thirteen. -Wen-yao! -Fourteen. Where has he gone to? Wait. Did we just turn around on the steps? -No. -Did we? What was that? FEBRUARY 28, 2020 Test the sound. One, two, three, four. SUPERNATURAL STORIES IN CAMPUS Numerous supernatural stories have been circulating among students in many campuses. The haunted elevator at CCU. The Moon Lake at Taiwan University. The Lixing campus at Cheng Kung University. And Tung Hu University that was founded 62 years ago is a hotbed for supernatural stories. The best-known forbidden spot is the Female Ghost Bridge. It was built for the convenience of the students. It didn't have a name back then. Later, rumor has it that a girl was dumped by her boyfriend. She waited for him until 12 a.m. until she couldn't take it and jumped into the lake. Since then, an extra step would suddenly appear on the stairs at midnight. Today is February 28, 2020. It's a very special year. A leap year. Four years ago, today, a clip of a courage test was posted online. A white shadow appeared in the end. Let's find out if it is the legendary… ghost. The scariest thing is that all five students in the clip had died. Their bodies were found scattered around campus. It should've been a case that shocked the entire country, but no one followed up on it. RISKING LIFE FOR COURAGE TEST Did the police cover it up due to the pressure from the university? Or did the ghost drive them to commit suicide? Let me find out the truth. They say, an extra step will appear on the initial 13-step stairs at midnight. At that moment, never turn your head because the ghost might be right behind you. Today is February 28, the date it happened. Let's check how many steps are there during the day. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen-- I'm sorry. One more take. Are you okay? I'm fine. You were a news anchor. Why did they send you to do this? Don't rub salt in my wound. No one watches the morning news anyway. At least, these are real. Things that really happened. So, you think the story is true? The ghost killed people? There is always some truth in a story. Never believe what you see on the surface. I'll definitely get something. Don't worry. I'll get my old job back. The price you pay for surviving is so high. Here. Ready? Wait. Let's start when you're ready. Five, four, three, two… Let's see how Sung and Yu-ching get on with the props. Hey, can't you borrow a normal classroom? I only have keys to the ones in my department. So many eyes are staring at you! You feel comfortable? Actually, I enjoy the attention I get like this. Okay, let's see the result of our hard work! Come! Goodness. Could that be a supernatural phenomenon? Supernatural your ass! It means you have to do it again! I'm off to film the others. You guys keep flirting with each other. -You haven't interviewed me! -No one wants to interview you! Or you can interview her! -Come interview me. -No! -So annoying! -Stop messing around! I forgot to start streaming. TUNG HU NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, LIVE START Hello, juniors. I'm Hsin-chiao, a postgraduate in the student union. The test will be held tomorrow. Let's see what the captain and the duty officer are doing. Let's go! Shall we change the place? It's too dangerous to do it on the bridge. Why didn't you say it earlier? Well, we can still change it. Of course not. You know very few people have signed up for ours. But so many people joined the courage test held at CCU. They did it before us. We must get more people! Are you stupid or something? Safety comes first! You said nothing back then. Everything is ready. Are all law students as stupid as you? Me? Te-chuan, look at her! So mean! This is the captain, Meng Po-ju. We call her "San-nu." What is this? Chi Te-chuan, you're so out of the loop! I'm doing livestreaming. So what should I say? -Don't bully him. -Then say something on his behalf. I'll do it. Te-chuan, a third-year student in Mass Communication, the duty officer this year. His favorite pastime is scaring girls! That's why the courage test is being held on that bridge. I didn't choose the place. I don't know anything. So who chose the place? Well, it's you. -No, I remember it was-- - Let's not discuss this. Let's check if everything is ready for tonight. Let's go! Well, I'm really curious about who chose the place. -You're so annoying. -It's really haunted. -So scary! -It's not scary. -You're the scary one. The scariest. -I'm scary? You'd better… Wait. What? Please stop filming. TUNG HU NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, LIVE END Do you have to be like this? Can't we talk nicely? I've said everything I needed to say. Just look after yourself. You still won't come back to me? I'm giving you one more chance. Please stop making a scene, okay? What are you guys doing? Nothing. It's all set. -Te-chuan, it's dark here! -Okay. Go to hell then. We agreed not to show my face. Stop filming. Don't make me lose my job for so little money. I'm sorry. We have stopped filming. You are so annoying. Are you sure I won't be seen? I promise. You can talk now. A group of students met with an accident. They committed suicide in strange places. All in different places? That's what they told the public. The creepiest thing is they all drowned. The bridge and the dorm were cordoned off years ago. But those bloody kids just wouldn't listen. What do you think? Scary, right? Come here. Put this on and hide behind the tree. When you hear my cue, you dart out. Why don't you put it on and wait for my cue? -Because you look scarier! -What the hell? I look scary? It should be you. Even ghosts will be scared! I wasn't that mean, was I? I didn't mean it. Don't be angry. If I become a ghost, you're the first on my list! -Why don't I turn you into one? -Don't hit so hard! Really? Are you guys ready? I'm going to film the others. -Okay. We just need to adjust it a bit. -Come on, hurry up! What are you doing? -Have you started streaming? -Not yet. I'm testing the light. So I'll leave the filming to you two mass communication students! I'll shoot the offscreen footage with this. Sit here, quick. I can't start until you sit. I don't want to sit here! Gosh, just sit down. We're all here. No need to be scared. I'll protect you if anything happens. It's almost time. I'm about to start streaming. You guys at the back! Ready? -Yes! -Yes! I'm the only one left here. You don't care about me! You're an IT student, why are you scared? According to quantum mechanics, ghosts do exist! We study liberal arts. I understand nothing. -What are you doing? -Hold it. Damn! Why do you blindfold me? Are you playing tricks on me or the juniors? We have to do it for real. You remember the rundown? No, I don't! We'll start streaming on the bridge! The bell tied to the chair is your cue. Take off the blindfold and walk up the bridge. Remember, don't count the steps! When we are done, go back to Room 414! Why is it taking so long? Are we starting yet? Stop messing around. Attention please, juniors. This year, the courage test will be held at Tung Hu's forbidden spot, the Female Ghost Bridge. You guys will be starting from here. When you hear the bell, take off the red cloth and circle around the lake. Go. Please do remember. No matter what happens, never turn your head on the stairs. One, two, three, four… -What is he doing? -Six. -Did anyone ask him to count? -Didn't we agree not to count? Let him count. It's more exciting. No, we can't do that. Wen-yao! Wen-yao, stop counting! Wen-yao! -Wen-yao! -Eleven. -Wen-yao! -Wen-yao, stop counting! -Fourteen. -Wen-yao! There really are 14 steps. Who did that? Aren't we all right here? Where has he gone to? Where is Wen-yao? You guys are so damn childish! Wait. Did we just turn around on the steps? -It doesn't count, does it? -No. Did you do that too? It wasn't me. Let's go! You tried to trick me? I'll scare you bastards to death! THE CHAIR WAS A GOOD TRICK. REMEMBER TO PACK UP THE CAMERA. What chair? That doesn't count, right? Forget about the camera. -Yes? -Turn the screen to the brightest. Okay, this is as bright as it gets. Why is it getting dimmer? Brighten the screen more! Brighten the screen more. This is as bright as it gets. This is as bright as it gets. -What the hell? -This is as bright as it gets. Turn the flashlight on. It's on. Shit. I thought there was someone. I'm here. What happened just now? -Was that you? -No, it wasn't me! So why did we start running then? Someone started it and we just followed suit! What the hell is going on? Calm down, okay? We said we'd go back first, right? Let's go back to the dorm first. Wen-yao didn't reply to my text. Should we go look for him? You and Wen-yao played a trick on us. Didn't you? I won't admit it without any evidence. I can smell crime. So what are you? A judge or psychic? Here is the evidence! In that case, I've snatched the evidence back! Silly you! Put me down or they will see us. We'll make it public then. But we're just having a fling. That really hurts. I'm doing it for your sake. I know. Besides, if she hears about it, it will be hard for you to deal with it. Don't you worry about that. I didn't break up with her properly. I'm sorry. I'm happy as long as we're together. I'm only happy when I'm with you. Okay. Let's go look for Wen-yao. He's not replying to my text at all. So annoying! Where are the others? Why did we bother to hold the courage test on the bridge? I'm going to karaoke later. It's so late! We have an event tomorrow morning. I don't understand why we were assigned to a deserted dorm. It's so spooky here! Don't be scared. I'll be back soon to keep you safe. Okay. I'm going to the restroom. Wait here. It's all right. Wen-yao! Wen-yao! Where has he gone? -It's already more than 10,000 views! -Why so many? What does this comment mean? "You can see the ghost even in the promo." Wait. -That's it, isn't it? -Let me see. HSIN-CHIAO: ARE YOU SEEING SAN-NU? It's just a smudge. Is it Wen-yao? No. They're asking if we have found Wen-yao. He hasn't gone back yet? DON'T THINK TOO MUCH I guess not. WE'LL TALK LATER Where did he go this late? I'm the only friend you have. Who are you chatting with? Bullshit. I've got tons of friends, okay? Then why did you follow me to Tung Hu? You could have gone to a better one. Give it back to me! Just tell me you're talking to Sung. I'm just wondering why he has been gone so long. I was only asking. Wait. Something is going on between you two, right? No, something's going on at the bridge! Who is it? Is it you, Sung? Who is it? Go have a look. It's nothing. It was the wind. Hello? You'll be a bit late? Okay. Yu-ching? So, Yu-ching cares about me. Pong! Fifty thousand. Fifty thousand. No need to choose. They all stink. Fuck! It's occupied! You hear me? Fuck! What's wrong with you? Damn. Let me see who it is. Fuck! Let go of me! Let go of me! Fuck! Let go! What the hell? What the hell? No. Fuck! "Team Tung Hu put in so much effort. They went all out. You can see the ghost even in the promo. There's a white shadow at the back. Run!" These were the comments posted on that day. We can see that everyone was crazy about the rumor of the Female Ghost Bridge. Okay. Cut! Why are we filming this? We can do an insert. Team B sent us a clip. Didn't they go film the Taoist monk? Master, what has the accident in 2016 got to do with the Female Ghost Bridge? The ghost needs to find her replacement. Those who died in the leap year are forever trapped in hell. The same tragedy may happen again this year! There are people there. The bad vibes are the thickest today. Another five people will die. Don't go! Leave now! So, the rumor of the Female Ghost Bridge is true? Let me check the livestream again. Didn't five students die before? And it will happen again? I think I saw something. Rewind it. Look! He didn't even pack up the camera. Where on earth did Wen-yao go? I have no idea. We saw no signs of him like he was a ghost. Don't say something like that. What? Don't be so superstitious. Don't take chances at a time like this. Don't be skeptical. So you believe in the rumor of the bridge? Then why did you hold the event here? I didn't agree with it. So whose idea is it? I think Wen-yao must have gone back. He would send a text if he did. Let me call him. How did this happen? Should we check the CCTV footage at the security office? Okay. Come in. Don't let others see you. I'm not sure if the file is still intact. No records before year 2012 were saved. Find it yourself. Be quick. "Men's Dorm 11." Year 2012. Year 2013, 2014, 2015. Year 2016, here it is. February. February 28. I've got it. One, two. Three. Four. Five. They are the students that died that day. It's the footage of them returning to the dorm. -Check which room they stayed in. -Okay. Hello? The papers are here? I'll send someone to get them. I need to copy this. Help me get it at the front gate. I see. Okay. There is no one here. I guess they went on patrol. Should we just check the monitor ourselves? That's illegal. You can keep watch. Why should I be your accomplice? We don't know when they'll be back. If anything happens to Wen-yao, won't we be charged? With manslaughter? So persuasive. That's why you fell for me. We don't know who fell for whom yet, okay? Sung didn't answer the call? It didn't go through. Miss. Can you stop pacing back and forth? Then come to the restroom with me. Okay. Let's go. Look over here. What are you doing? Usually, I'm the one who gets scared. Now it's your turn. Beg me. Whatever! Just hurry up. Where are you going? The restroom is over there. Sung is there. I want to go to the other side. Are you sure you don't want to run? No. It will leak if I run fast. I can only go like this. Stop laughing! I can't hold it if I laugh! Yu-ching, come on! See? You wanted to pee too, right? You're not filming, right? Yu-ching. Yu-ching? Why did you come from the outside? Were you not in the restroom too? No, I wasn't. Are you done? What? Someone is in there. What are you doing? Let me check. Otherwise, no one will be able to sleep tonight. -No, don't. -It's fine. I scared you, didn't I? Don't be such a pain in the neck! Go to your beloved Sung! Chao Hsin-chiao, wait for me! Why did it get so dirty? Hsin-chiao! Hsin-chiao, wait for me! Hsin-chiao! Ghosts that haunt campuses. A lot of ghost stories about the building at CCU, right? It was built in the shape of an upside-down Bagua, a perfect place for ghosts. -Haunted elevator is the most popular. -Haunted elevator? Yes, a teacher went to check. He pressed the first floor, but the elevator didn't stop. It kept going down and never came back up. That story about CCU is so scary. The story of the Female Ghost Bridge is scarier. What exactly happened on the bridge? Didn't she drown herself in the lake? Not at all. It's not true. So what really happened? One year, a female student decided to elope with her boyfriend. They agreed to meet on the bridge. The girl kept waiting until midnight, but there was no sight of her boyfriend. At that moment, someone appeared on the steps and waved at her. Just as she stepped on the 13th step, she was dragged into the woods and raped by five men. No matter how she struggled and begged them, they refused to let her go. In the end, she was pushed into the lake and drowned. Ever since then, every day at midnight, an extra step would appear on the 13-step bridge. At that moment, -never turn your head around. -Twelve, thirteen. If you do, -the ghost will be right in front of you. -Fourteen. You're so mean! Why are you being so serious? If you dump me like that guy, I won't wait for you there. Don't wait for me. You'd better go reincarnate. You're finished! I'll strangle you! Okay, I surrender! There's someone over there. There's nothing. It is. There… That's weird. Didn't you see it? The head is moving. What head? There is something. What? I saw something. But there shouldn't be anyone else at this time. It must be Wen-yao. Let's go to the makeup classroom. Let's go. Come on. Why is it taking so long to wash it off? Was I being too much? Hsin-chiao! Wait for me! What the hell? Help… Sung? Is that you? What are you doing? What are you doing? What happened to you? The doors are closing. What on earth is Wen-yao doing? I wonder what the others are up to. Te-chuan. This is B1. -Didn't we press the fourth floor? -What's going on? The doors are closing. Why isn't it going up? San-nu. What's wrong? There really was something in there. There's nothing. Why don't you believe me? I do. It's… Don't be scared. I'll protect you if anything happens. Can we go back? We'll go back once we found Wen-yao, okay? -Let's go. -Okay. This is Room 414 where the students had stayed the night it happened. At-- What's wrong? I'm not feeling well. It smells in there. Damn you, Yu-ching. Did you have to be so annoying? You're still hiding? What are you doing? Who's there? Hsin-chiao! Hsin-chiao! Hsin-chiao! Hsin-chiao! Hsin-chiao! No, not that way! It's strange. Why did Wen-yao go back to the classroom? Wen-yao. Wen-yao. Don't go in there. Wait for me here. I'll turn on the lights. Let me check. It's not working. I'll check at the back for another switch. Be quick! Wen-yao. Wen-yao! Te-chuan… Wen-yao. San-nu. Wen-yao! Where are you going? Te-chuan, where are you? Te-chuan. Te-chuan. Come out now, Te-chuan. Te-chuan. Stop messing around! Te-chuan, are you over there? Te-chuan! Stop messing around! It's not funny! Te-chuan! San-nu! Go! Call someone! There is no signal. Quick! Quick! Wait. Why did you stop? Don't you find it strange? We've been walking for a while. I don't care! I just want to get out! Yu-ching! Get up. How did we end up here? We're doomed. Yes, we're doomed! Don't worry. We'll find a way down. Shih Yu-ching! Pull yourself together! I'll protect you. We shouldn't have played the game. We won't be able to get away. We can't escape. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. -There must be a way. -I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. Yu-ching, get up! I don't want to die. We can get-- STUDENT UNION OFFICE What are we doing here? It's the office of those students who died. See what you can find. I'll check these. It has been four years. What clues do you expect to find? Check every nook and cranny. Okay. TUNG HU NATIONAL UNIVERSITY How did you get the statement from them? It's better if you don't know. Te, come film this. "Li Wen-yao." He was found drowned underneath the bridge. "Meng Po-ju." Also drowned in some corners of the campus. "Cheng Lin-en, Li Tien-ming." Both of them drowned too. Only Chao Hsin-chiao went missing. Why did they all drown in such strange places? -What? -Look. There were six people. Let me replay it. But only five students were mentioned. Right here. There were six people that day. Only five were mentioned in the file. The news reported five too. How about the sixth student? Don't get any closer. Follow me! Hsin-chiao? Come. It's okay. What just happened? Wait. Why are we walking towards there? San-nu, let's go! San-nu! San-nu! Yu-ching. Yu-ching! Why am I back here? Yu-ching! Is that you? What are you doing here? Didn't you say you'd protect me? Didn't you say you'd protect me? Yes. I said I'd protect you. Didn't you say you'd protect me? Yu-ching. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What's wrong? Where is she? I thought you're leaving? Why did you come back? We should take a look at these. The student union's photos from the past years. And? We could check and find out who the sixth student was. That's odd. "Meng Po-ju." "Li Wen-yao." "Li Tien-ming, Cheng Lin-en." "Chao Hsin-chiao." Only Hsin-chiao is in the group photo. Why aren't the others such as Po-ju or Wen-yao in here? Who are these five unknown people? This photo was taken in 2012. TUNG HU THE BRAVEST! But we're investigating the one in 2016. I must have missed something. You mean something happened in 2012 as well? Didn't the courage test on the bridge happened in 2016? So it stopped after that. I remember a strange article on BBS. You should look it up. FEMALE GHOST BRIDGE, TUNG HU UNIVERSITY "Five people died on the bridge. A news blackout was imposed. It wasn't reported." But there wasn't a news blackout. This was posted in 2012. On the same date in 2012, a courage test was held on the bridge too. You guys keep flirting with each other. -You haven't interviewed me! -No one wants to interview you! Or you can interview her. -Come interview me. -No! -So annoying! -Stop messing around! Hello? Where are you? I forgot to start streaming. FEBRUARY 28, 2016 Hello, juniors. I'm Hsin-chiao, a postgraduate in the student union. The test will be held tomorrow. Let's see what the captain and the duty officer are doing. Let's go! I'm going to film the others. -Okay. We just need to adjust it a bit. -Hurry up! You're so slow. FEBRUARY 28, 2012 What are you doing? Nothing. We are ready. Come on. Hurry up! It's almost midnight. You guys hurry up! Okay. -Have you started streaming? -Not yet. I'm testing the light. FEBRUARY 28, 2016 You guys at the back! Ready? -Yes! -Yes! I'm the only one left here. You don't care about me! You're an IT student, why are you scared? What happened to the students in 2012? Hsin-chiao! Shih Yu-ching! Pull yourself together! I'll protect you. I'm sorry. Chao Hsin-chiao survived. She took part in it again four years later. Another four people died. What sort of person was she? What on earth did she experience that brought her back again? There must be some connection. Please, I beg you to spare me. I'll do anything. You still won't come back to me? -I'm giving you one more chance. -Stop making a scene. What are you doing? Nothing. Is everything ready? Go to hell then! Remember. No matter what happens, never turn your head around. One, two. What is he doing? Didn't we agree not to count? Let him count. It's more exciting. Didn't we just turn our heads? Chao Hsin-chiao! Why did you choose her over me? What happened to us had nothing to do with her! You're behind all these tricks, aren't you? All of you deserve to die! I gave you a chance. I thought you would protect me. I do want to protect you. But we really aren't meant for each other! Please, I beg you to let me go! Let San-nu go, please. I beg you! Don't hurt San-nu! Te-chuan. Help! San-nu… I'm sorry. Te-chuan. Help! I'm the only one left here. You don't care about me! If you dump me like that guy, -I won't wait for you there. -You deserve to die! Help! I'll protect you. Don't be scared. I'll protect you. I'll strangle you to death! -Why don't you believe me? -Ghosts do exist. -All of you deserve to die! -Stop it! You said you'd protect me! I'm sorry. Don't kill me. I don't want to die. Are you really afraid of dying? You killed Wen-yao and the others, didn't you? You have to die too. Don't kill me. I'll do anything you ask me to do. Do you think I never tried? She won't let me go. I shouldn't have broken the spell on the bridge. I can't die even if I want to. But I want to live on! Stop talking! It's no better to live on. For four years, every time I close my eyes, I saw those five faces. Are you sure you want to live on? It's a high price to pay. There must be a way. There must be a way, right? Hit my head with it. Today, five people must die. Kill me. Kill me! It's easy to keep yourself alive. Will you kill to keep yourself alive? Come on. Come on. Come on! Kill me and you'll live! They are Meng Po-ju, Chao Hsin-chiao, and Li Wen-yao. Where was the photo taken in 2016? Did you find anything? There is nothing here. Maybe earlier? -How much earlier? -When did the rumor of the bridge start? More than 30 years ago, I guess. Hello? SEARCH: CAMPUS DEATHS, BRIDGE The people for the shoot are here. I'll go and get ready. Do you really have to shoot at midnight? You wanted it real, right? It happened exactly four years ago today. UNKNOWN DEATH ON CAMPUS, FEMALE STUDENT FOUND UNDER BRIDGE DEATH ON CAMPUS, FEMALE STUDENT FOUND UNDER BRIDGE REPUBLIC OF CHINA CALENDAR, YEAR 69, FEBRUARY 29 It's February 29 again. So, something is bound to happen on every leap day? 11.50 P.M. Oh, no. Te is on the bridge. It's hard to live on. I've suffered a lot to survive. If I want to live, five people must die today. I heard that people had died on this bridge. It has to be fake news. But the seniors say it's true that the bridge is haunted. Seriously? You really believe it? I don't care as long as we are paid. -Everyone. -Yes? I need you to walk up the stairs and count the steps. Then, turn around. Okay? -Yes. -Yes. Ready. Five. Four. Three.
