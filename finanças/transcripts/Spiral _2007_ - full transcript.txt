Can you hear me where were you? I'm sorry. Well, that's very good, but It doesn't help ... do you know why? Because I had 6,000 phone calls. I had to reach them over the weekend. Now my employee, despite the fact that his blood is close to the office He still can't come to work on time. I'm sorry. I think I'm because of an unknown. He wakes me up in the middle of the night.

How do I do an R 27 project? What am I doing when you ask me? Please go to the card. It rained! I had to go and become a meteorologist. My boss says finding a customer. It's none of my business. Isn't that great? It's not been a week He came and told me. You don't use it. Well, I'm not a milkman. I have 6 sales a day. I'm still learning! I drank it and sprayed it on his face. Have coffee? I sprayed it. Who is really inexperienced, But he was just sitting there and me ... You know, I really want to be good at it. I'm really sorry. It's not fair that one person. In this way, he will be with someone. So what should I do? I go and behave like children and I'm doing something stupid and now I feel that ... He probably deserved it. Sir, we have an insurance company. We are automatic. No! Sir. We do not insure life. No, We just... OK. We think it's like sexy makeup No flaws. Or sex itself. Thank you. What can I say? I'm very busy! In addition, I know your routine. I can tell you it's time now. A world of love and its present is waiting for you You roll! Have fun as long as you have time! Now whatever. It's $10! Hey, why don't we play a game next week? When you have lunch in the playground Like that old one? You can work on your long shot. - I don't know how to shoot long - I mean exactly that That girl calls me every night. I want to see his family. Look, I think there has to be some understanding Some kind of conversation between two guests. Because by then you should have a chance. Have fun with other things. Does he know this? He ... Of course not, what a joke you are making. He never agrees. There is nothing left. Hurry up. She is beautiful before that Christie "I fired you". Why? He came to work late for the first three days. In any case, it doesn't matter She had a boyfriend. You recently ... Did you hire someone else? "I always hire people," Mason said. No, I mean ... It's a girl. Someone is looking for something, huh? Let me think ... no! But I'm not the only one I'm hiring, how come? Nothing! Nothing. Okay, romantic office. It can be a trick. Damn, I've been missing that web all along Dirty away. Fortunately, that doesn't matter. Just throw this damn ball. Better a poor horse than no horse at all. I don't want to get better. And the problem is lies. Misen, Hi wait! - Hello - Hi ... I missed you at lunch - Yeah... - Do you always walk home? Don't have a car? Natural behavior .. Cool. I understand! What do you do on weekends? Nothing. Are you going to this period? No. Because I'm thinking about going. You have to go. You are very ... happy. Because one person is all today. He won the games. I won all the games! I won all the games! "Do you know what that means?" Is Josh's coffee safe again? No, it was just a cup, I didn't touch the teapot! "It was a precise blow." Exact blow. Anyway, now that I've got my current job.. What should I do next? I'm thinking of becoming a "feminist" or an astronaut I'm probably a "feminist." I'm afraid of heights. What does a "feminist" do? He behaves more sexually. I do not know. Maybe I'll be "ninja." I always thought it was enough. Ninja's daughter is not in the world. Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first. Say,"Ninja" Say "Misen" soon "Ninjaaaa" - Ninja "" Mason "... Say" - "Ninja" Isn't the pronunciation great? Do you know what you are learning? You want to learn "karate" kicks! It bruises you. I practiced. I'm really saying it's a good job. It makes you feel good. I ... I live here. OK! "Well, that's great." Thank you for coming to my house. Maybe you would like to come and Do you eat anything brown and see our paintings? Excellent! Ok i'll see you later. Thank you. About the umbrella. Oh, yes, of course! These things are very rare in this city, But if you look closely, you will find one. My trowel was probably not wet, Guys, play your game. How are you buddy? You ... Do you have water? "You're a guest if" You don't have to ask for water. Guess! I always hated this game. He hears your voice on the other side and it's over. I want to make my own game where. Nobody says anything, it's just an idea. - You came? - Of course, when I came, I told you to come. Are you getting ready to go ... or? It was very cool! Very cool! I hate these people. So why did you come? I didn't come for them. See! See this. It is very beautiful. - It's cold. - Give up. A very valuable sight. It is neither harmful nor beneficial. Scenery... It's beautiful. Did you see? I told you. You see, you can park here. Lauren Hurst "See You Again". When I was little, I used to go there and Feed the ducks. It was wonderful. I think it's telecommunications. Yes, you are right. Look at that apartment. ...If I had a Vivo like this ... You were looking out of my window. You all saw bricks. "You have to paint this". I ... don't look Just man? Like... Like that girl in the design? I'm sorry. It has nothing to do with me. We all have a past. If I told you the story of my life. We had to spend the rest of the night here. But ... you now ... You paint from everyone, don't you? No, no one. You know, we can get out of here. Maybe you should just wear your coat. Bat Caves? I can ... Yes, sure. They are the best. Jazz's "Best Albums". Is this something we are going to do? Only with larger brushes. Are you kidding me? They are postcards. They are unique. Did you make them for a special person? Am i doing right? Is there anything I need to do? Only... be yourself. Hello friend. What are you doing? I didn't see you go last night. What's the situation? Is it good. ! Is it good! I knew that design book would work for you. The best $10 I threw away. You can't believe how stupid they were last night. I'm bleeding. Next time, we'll have another party. We want the employer to make a plan. I have to go. I will eat. Why don't you come and make a change? Can you have lunch in my office? No! My grandmother was a fortune teller. It's true. My whole family is more or less normal. You knew you were still "Romanian." There are tribal tribes. Stupid. You know... With a chariot pulled by horses. You go to the plains and come, camp, and all that. You can't be great ... Do you know freedom? Free from what? Do whatever you want? Wherever you want to go, you know? Josh doesn't matter. Let me see your hand. Why? Let me see! If the path of life with I want to know the path of health in the contradiction of Mikham. If this is the case, it usually means that You are going to get married. You're in a trance. How come you are to all people? You are proud of something. Good choice. His voice is like a meteorological report. Saw, not too slow. I did not understand. I think you don't understand "jazz". The ducks! Look at them, they are not beautiful! You have to spend most of your time outside, I really say This is my new year experience for you. I can't accept that you've lived here all your life. ! And you didn't come here once. The comrades of these ducks are much fatter than them. That I remember. See those little kids. They are feeding those frozen fat birds. I used to do this when I was a kid I made them fat. I made them fat. Careless. You won't let me see. What are you doing? No, there are rules. You can't see it until it's over. Yes, I fully understand when This law applies to a painting, but ... I think it's worth seeing. I have the initial plan. This is not it. This is the next plan. Who said that the next painting was working? "You think so" Does the image embody the soul of man? The Indians believed this. Not all of them, but most of them believed. I'm curious what they think about this. "You're trying" Did you steal my soul. Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like BT aint for me either. You have turkeys, right? - Yeah - So it's all over now. Playing the same movie ... In the neighborhood where I grew up There is an old cinema. He also released some great movies. "Casablanca" and "Rear Window" I used to go to school every day. I will watch that movie many times. We also have to go sometimes. I never went to the cinema. I'm sorry, did you ever say that? Even with your family, for example? "So those postcards" Who did you make it for? What? Let's go to the next painting. I have a weak understanding. That's part of the goal "Jazz"is not about acceptance It's very difficult to communicate with him. This is not lovable or satisfying. Only the finest musicians can perform it. Professors, people who dedicate themselves. To teach music theory. Rules. And then they coordinate with each other like a unit. They break their valuable rules. This is unacceptable and worthless. All at once. I think these are probably more words. You have to tell me in a meeting. - I like "Jazz". - And so on. And I can't believe you don't drink coffee. When we go inside, you do the same thing I do, I want to try you ... where did you go? Can we talk about it? What? No, I'm just ... I can't figure out what color it is ... Use shadows on the arm. So we're not going to talk about it. OK. Why don't you use blue? Because blue takes the clarity out of your eyes. How about orange. It is much closer to light brown than this dress. Does it matter. Yes It's all about "contrast." To clarify some members. It's best to hide other members. Can't they understand? So they don't attract attention. Now I understand Why are you interested in painting? Why? Because you depend on it ... And that's great about you. "Contrast"! And I'm jealous of you. You shouldn't be jealous of me. That's me. Prove that damn elbow. Take the guard up. And remember all the ways to the goal Draw it in your mouth. You're still a great painter. So "contrast," Han? Yeah. I can understand ... Some call it psychosis, But so does "contrast." Unaware, comrade, you have always been a psychic But so far you have come a long way. I am proud of you. "Contrast" it's true. Just like your paintings. I'm telling you. Ms. Khoshgala loves them. Do you remember that "Jessica" from the "Private Coaches Center"? He was stunned when he saw those postcards. You use it for painting. He stole one. Saw, it became a donkey! The teacher had to do all my work. Get her to find her underwear! I'm telling you, that beautiful lady was a strange creature. I am curious to know what he is doing now I'm sorry. Berkeley "They've been looking for you for an hour". Hello Darling. Conference Room 3. His friend is the craziest thing. Have you ever seen. God, I love the boss. We will practice shooting later. Can I go earlier today? Why? It takes more time before you go to the club To reach yourself? I was joking. Do whatever you want? And people say. I'm not cool. In practice, this is not the case. Finally, you are going to tell me where we are going or not Do I have to put you in a mud hole? Christmas "I love you so much". - We are now in the second week of "December" - Oh! Do you know what we should do? We have to go to the passage and listen to Santa's arms ... Let's take a picture and whatever we want tell him and ... Screaming angry mothers. Let's look at their children. Without elves and fairies. "Are you afraid of fairies?" - Like giants. - These are the craziest things in the world. Oh Vaisa .. Vaisa. I got something for you. Ibn Chaba? Your gift, sir. No, no, no! You have to wait until "Christmas". You ruin the surprise. They have a bus ticket. Bus tickets? Two of them ... They are without a destination, which means we can Let's go with them wherever we want. Like my wizarding tribe and clan. Do you have friends. - Thank you. - You'r welcome. - Close your eyes - What? Just close your eyes. OK. Let me guess ... "Mason"? - Arumeter. - Ok, slower! Do you want one? Couple. What do you think? For the next painting? You are like ... A jazz musician? Jazz "singer". Now I love everything. What does it mean to be a model if you can't live like a scoundrel? What's your idea? Beige or burnt brown? Oh" Mason "..." Mason" Never ask a girl If he wants to be painted with beige, The answer is always the same! Oh! I'll be right back. You OK? I'm sorry. I had no intention ... It's nothing ... just ... Only ... I was shocked! What did i do? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Only ... No more elves and fairies. Without jinn and fairies, I promise. I'm sorry. I'm just saying ... If you put that lipstick in a damn glass in the sink, Then he found that he was very kind to me. It is as if he is following this trouble. This is basically a conflict. "You still have that girl." Do you paint. Yeah. I have to kill you. You do that very well. You are finding his numbers. There is no more news about midnight calls. Not the way I see it, brother. It eliminates all your opportunities one by one ... If you understand what I mean, a good hit ... And the error went away! Do you think I can handle it? What do you say? Where to take it? "Dinner" Christmas. Do you think that I can handle "Amber"? Careless comrade, Do you really think it's a good idea? "Am I trying?" I know, this ... I mean, that's great. "Christmas" dinner this year. I want you to be happy. Why don't you come to dinner with us? Like this You are waiting ... You don't either. I do not know. This time ... it's different. This time in particular. They are not special. "They're just girls." Remember this. Look, you're an adult. If you want to invite someone ... Just think about it. OK? I mean, you're really good at it. I went and saw my mother. Did you go to the ground? I didn't know you had ever been there. Did not go. Is it good. Remember our advice and Don't pull the trigger. Do you think people go to hell? You're asking me, I think you're old. Are you going to hell? I don't know buddy. Not at all. "I'm not coming out" What do you say? I don't know what you think about this situation, But I am a shy girl, If you don't want to, you don't have to. OK ... Promise never about it Don't talk to anyone. Is it good? It's beautiful. So Miles wants to run all over that area ... (Miles Davis is the greatest jazz musician, composer, trumpet player and leader of the 20th century music group in the United States. Different salons and liquor stores ... Once upon a time, a young musician had a chance to do this Work with it. To perform with his master. The child looked at the entire history of Miles' life. He was very excited to perform with her. He practiced a lot and performed wonderfully. He came down from the stage right with Miles. When they were no longer friends? He went to the Miles for a drink. And he asked her, "How do you think I did?" "You were great, you and I have to be a musician," Miles said. Let's make a loud noise and hit the road. I did not catch. Because Bam musicians are usually easy to work with. - And he was like all of us. - Wait ... don't move. I'm working on your shoulder. I'm sorry. "Why didn't I come at all?" Let me see your life line. You never asked again. Maybe I should have stopped. So maybe I can get your character. I understand. What qualities? You are very mysterious ... I mean, not because of your art, but because of you. Of course you have limits. Perhaps the mystery is not the right word. You are a mysterious person. Well ... that's what you said "Contrast"! I hate this increase and decrease in electricity. Rain should not be good for electricity. Like a hair dryer in the bathtub? Hey, he ... he's one of those little ones, right? Postcards. This was one of his favorite albums. Who is your favorite? - We have to work harder, it's almost over. - "Mason"Who's Favorite? - We are very close to the end of the work. - "Mason" ... - I did not mean it - again It's too late. They were my father's aunt. He ... sent them all back. He didn't want them. "Mason" "Mason" ... are you okay? Yeah. You're going to have Christmas with me. Will you come to Berkeley's house? Yeah. It's just the earth's almond sphere. That's good. Are you doing bush? "If there's a nuclear explosion," he said. The only things left to do are the almond butter and the beetles. That's good. I want to apply this to some bread. It's cold. Hey, I can ... Can I get you some socks? The ground is frozen. I also have apples. I didn't know if you asked me that ... What are you doing? I was looking for a sock. It's cold. Last night ... Let's finish the painting. OK. I'm getting paid this week. I buy everything. I didn't do that all year. Great. Berkeley "says our shareholders are managers". This is the first time. - What's next? - Hey ... I don't have to see what's next. You know the rules. Put it on ... I think so ... - For one of the designs - No What? I ... I finished this project halfway through. Carelessly "Mason", I nail one of those designs. You are not an artist. - I'm sorry - forget it - See, why don't you determine the next plan ... - Just ... forget it, okay? Are you angry? "Mason" How many girls did you draw? Before me. What? How many "misses"? I want to know. No .. I don't know. You don't know either Don't you want to say? Why are you doing this? I'm feeling a little helpless now, okay? I ... Usually ... - I'm not usually like that - Well, so am I. No? "Amber" I'm sorry. I only have a little time. - Why? - Not because of you .. I need to think Are you still coming to a "Berkeley" dinner party? I need time to organize my thoughts, okay? Damn rain. Maybe you should call him. It's probably too late. Maybe I should go out. Maybe ... Forget the address. "Do we really have to wait for him?" Okay, okay, let's wait. Why did you invite him at all? Please, you said 10 minutes ago. You did a good job. It was different. Oh, I see, there's something wrong with that, but when It's not like that again. - It's not fair! - Isn't that a fair thing? Do you know what I could with my family. Be in Vancouver. So you don't like it? What's his name Do you have fun? - Is this fun? - You better take a look at yourself What is "Berkeley"? Do you know? Do you really want to know what this is? It's called friendship! It's about having someone in your life. In front of the same fool behind him and ... It's about me being the only damn person. He gives it to that place. This is not friendship. This is charity. - Oh, really? - Yeah That animal has been taught to you. Do you know what Damn this nonsense? I heard in "Canada" now is the best time of the year. - What? - Hit the check - Don't take it seriously - go out Listen to yourself. I cooked all this damn dinner. Merry Christmas. Welcome! - I miss you! - And still here You think you're going to be a better person. Because you invited him here for dinner? Or did you talk to him on the card for 5 minutes? If you want to help him, You can help him. Put some charcoal in my sock! You are abusing him. No, no, darling. I'm the only one who's abusing you. Get out of the way! It didn't matter to you, brother. That's a scumbag, what can I say? I didn't remember to tell him anything else. - I can't find "Amber" - Do you know what Stop cursing this "Amber", okay? I want to smoke this cigarette, then We go inside and have a ball for dinner. He must not be lost. He was a guest of invitation. What is it, is it here? "You can't all" Do this with yourself. Maybe he thought he was a guest at my house. Should we fall into these stories again? Because you went to that damn cemetery. That's why? You can't give up on yourself all the time. Put yourself in this situation. - I have to go find it. - "Mason"Calm down. Do not touch me. What are you doing...? - Where were you? - Can i come to you. I'm sorry, Meta ... I'm sorry. - I can't do that there anymore - What not to do? I can't ... I think we were lost. What do you say? I think you want me to be like that. That I can't. What do you mean? "Why can't I see the next plan?" - Because of the rules - What is the law What does this mean? Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this to me? Can I replace it in some way? Who are you to have? Are you trying to finish it? What do you say? Those design offices. Full of copies of the same designs. What do you think I feel now? "Who are they?" Where is that office? Designs. You painted me in all those designs. Where is that? This is the last plan ... - Why is it torn? - Where is the other one? Where is that? It should never be. Why did you do that? Until the paintings are finished Nobody saw them. You can't go now. Sit down. Don't move. - "Please don't do this" - You just have to follow the rules "Mason" .. "Mason" Suffocate .. Suffocate! You knew the rules. I asked you to be a model. I'm sorry. What's up here? Suffocate. Let everyone be calm. Another damn power outage Emergency power is going to be connected ... - Did you see There is nothing to worry about? - Help me What are you doing wrong Nothing, he is fine. Come here. What happened to you Han? Are you trying to get our couple fired? Did you lose your mind? You're late for work ... There is something else like these mental behaviors. Go to my office. What happened? Hey ... look at me ... look at me. Where is the spray? Where is the spray? Wait, they say. Come here. What am I giving you money for? Do you scold yourself? - How are you? - Close ... Close! "I swear to God this is the last time" He went to my belongings. Understandably ... I told you You have to deal with your own problems. - He found out about the rest - Who else is "Mason"? What are we talking about here? Pre-service? The one who wants to come and bleed you Draw sexy designs? Or ... maybe the one before was it ....? Is that damn Spanish? Is he a poet? Or maybe the girl you saw in the laundry. She is a beautiful "Korean". Do you understand? A pitiful little rubbish. None of that was real They don't exist. You made them.You make them all. They keep you happy. So I have nothing to do with it. - Wali Amber - Amber, Who? Is that Dr. Contrast? The one that works here? The one who came to my party? Why didn't I ever see him? You don't stop thinking about it, do you? Did you ever see someone smile at him? Talk to him. Did you see anyone get out of the way? Hold a door? But I killed him! "Mason"I've never seen your hands full of blood. But I could see your hands full of color. How many times have you seen yourself like this? Several times. - No no, that's true. - "You didn't kill anyone" Your father was killed. A long time ago, and I wished he hadn't been killed. I wish they were 20 years old to be informed ... So this is still a dark wound for you "But I'm not God." I had my own problems, you know? What am I going to do? You're going to throw that other nonsense away. You're going to have to clean your hands And you are supposed to calm down. What are you doing? I want to go away ... And clean them up. And calm down. I'm going to stay here and be careful I'll be fine, okay? None of them are real? None of them are real friends. How can you say otherwise? Yes, now everything. This is not my problem. How do I know? You are a doctor. Send one here as soon as possible. Is allowed? Yes. I heard an exciting person. He came here. - You know that .. Damn power outage. - It's true ... Anyway, that's annoying. He also has problems. We all have problems That dad is asking for help I know, Did you play last night? Are you kidding When Drexler finished the game, I didn't play anymore, How is life up there on the third floor? Are you having fun? I would be happier if with the least salary. I worked here. Your payment manager doesn't matter at all. They consider you responsible. Speak up. That's why I came ... One of my daughters this morning He did not come to work. - His mother called and was looking for him. - His mom? I guess he didn't go home last night. I hate being a babysitter. Anyway ... I'm sure this is the last conversation now that you have a nail, but ... I saw that friend many times, you are very upset. He is talking to Amber. If he saw her, he would Maybe you can ask him. What exactly did you say? She is beautiful. Who? That ... No one.
