Through the years, we stayed tight. Even though we're all so different. We're still friends. There's not a whole lot to do in Framingham.

I noticed that you previously worked for six months for our other location on 44th. And then you switched over to the 80 the street location. I can explain all of that. Basically, I worked for a lot of men and there was some sexual harassment involved. And just to keep it under wraps, I told them I'd like to be transferred. And my girl works at the front desk. She's a receptionist. And she told me there was an opening over here. There was a sister doing thing. So I told her basically I told my boss that I wanted to be transferred here, you know, sisters together doing it, you know, and. Well, you can be assured that I won't be coming on to you, correct? Well, I should let you know what your job responsibilities will be here at Trump Enterprises. You will be answering to me. And every morning there's certain things that must be in place.

We are on the slopes, well, you got a tap. I really did get a tap that I'm telling you, it's not that he's saying things like that. They're going to keep putting it in my hair, pulling out a hole. This is Isabelle Calzado for hip hop watch TV. We're on our way right now to the Slim Shady studios, where Eminem and Spliff are bolted themselves inside for fear of being attacked by the hip hop, which lets see what's going on. They're not allowing me inside. Only a cameraman has been allowed access for fear, this reporter, a female, may be the hip hop, which in disguise a wish of God is God then thwe princess. Oh, just no fucking women. Oh, magic. That song is about the winds. Yeah, he's pretty. I drink some hot water sprite, drink some hot water, and it has some exiting. Now, I didn't know you had to exit it. You know, man, I was seeing it soon. And then all of a sudden I start feeling this really weird feeling, you know what I'm saying? And my eyes start coming out of my, you know, like really fucked up. Are you following me? I'm following you at all on the train. All right. Listen, this is kind of a touchy subject, but OK, I'm going to call you back. And I'm a punchline to one to five inches snow despite my song. You know what I mean? Come on. Yeah. Anyways, I took I took the took the ex and she started laughing. She was laughing at the beginning, but I don't know. She was really laughing and looked like she was laughing at me. It sounded like she was laughing at me. But I did sound like a horse like Impey, OK? And she's laughing at me and I'm crying and I'm trying to figure out what's going on, because my puke was like this big. I looked in the mirror. My pupils, you my pupils were like this. Yeah. Yeah. Last year I had ASHRAE pupils from drinking the hot-blooded allowed to walk out the side of your bucket and not your face. Now phosphenes just Southtown don't sweat know that can't walk straight over crossover switch over change. Well I don't so I sent them and I summon me a couple yo. The real shit about to go down right now, I feeling it. I'm all ears, my brother, you know, my money's going just like the street down, man. I want to know, you know what I'm saying? What we have to do to try to get on, you know what I'm saying, and make things happen for us in this company right here. My my my audience is hot. You know what I'm saying? All we want to do is, you know, we just want to know the secret to selling all ammunition, some secrets. Simple, my brother. I rule the streets. Yeosu, if you want to get on, you got to put me on. Well, I have no problem with that. Would you ask him for half? You had half. You know what half means half of your artists, half of you, half of your production company, half of the distribution rights, half of the merchandizing rights, the studio, everything. Half. I do the money. I'll be there all the time. When you see us greased up black, which. Yeah, well I might them. No, I get instead of black. Oh, the next story. Yeah, I know. You know there's the black bridge. OK, the black with ten million dollars for the capture of black, which is victimizing rappers from the record label Gastrique. Dunno, what's the street done the best trying to grab me. It's definitely like, you know, me and I had to pull out and pop off on and you know, I mean, you're black, which is no such thing as with no shit. So why are they offering ten million dollars if there's no such thing? Let's figure it out, guys. It's a publicity stunt. I've been tracking this for about three weeks now. Each and every week there's more claims of witches attacking his artist. And every week record sales go up. There's no such thing as witches. How are we going to bring them a wish to get ten million dollars? We threaten to go to the press with them. We can bust them. We can get ten million. Do you want to blackmail some record industry? Is that what you're saying? Uh, yeah. How are we going to get to New York? I mean, we're in Salem and it's a mighty long way. Still fuckin car. That's what we'll do. Oh, OK. Gambino, fuck you. No, I don't think so. No, I don't think so. That's bad karma, dude. That's bad, bad, bad karma. Oh, yeah. You're the cop. That's bad. When we get the money, we just give the car back. That's OK. Great house. Crime, it's everywhere in our art, on our streets. There's no escaping it. And the hip hop, which is just another section of it, is no such thing as which is, you know, the black, which I don't know too much about. The black wish to tell you so much about the black race. But we have a witch that's not black so much. But she comes from a black cat book store and she's with us now. She's the best tarot reader, knows more about the craft than most people in town know the way it goes. People say the way Saddam made his way west and beat his way out. Tell. We're going to face of the green hair. Big feet, like 20 feet. Disgusting shit, you know, I see this snack. And we we consulted for hip hop on TV. I'm on the scene right now with Baucau rapper Sevior, who's having many, many problems with the which of course, Spanish viewers on retaining, which is one of them, is going to make him relax. So. All right. We Adobe. Good it's good to of reference firsthand to step off the light. And, you know, it's like you maybe should don't even make no sense. I ain't never seen shit like that in my life. And she was pretty big. She looked like a big a big green, green and black, you know, Sasquatch or some shit. And it starts swinging at me. Damn damn near. Pushed my feet back and all that. Well, you can't let me forget. La la la la la la la la. Ha ha ha. So anyways, she goes to put a finger up my ass, right. And I'm kind of twitching and shit. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. I'm just like bugging out, you know what I'm saying? My eyes are coming out of my ears. The high blood is like spilled all over the fucking place. And I'm trying to I'm trying to run while she got a finger like, you know, I'm saying starting to go up my ass. And I looked down and I had no fucking pass on. You know what I'm saying is being on these deep notes from Miles Davis, like, yo, man, it's like, well, we knew we had to cut those same because, you know, because all that crazy shit knows him. I don't know, man. I really get a good look now, man. I just feel like there's a whole bunch of madness, man. I got a body and I was like, sometimes, you know, me pieces come on by cells. Adobe went downstairs one morning. I was saying, I know all equipment. They said, no, this terrorism started playing all different types of bees back. The back side is crazy. Now the fuck is going on. That they might get mad. And I'm talking about it right now, or, you know, this is kind of scary on the table. I said Shinoda makes magnetizing. It's hitting the sit now low on the on the right notes. And I'll be having to look around these calls for me for me to move in with this man here, Stephen King, this prodigy mob deep. They don't fuck with the hip hop, which you just cannot find out about a real good plan. Yeah. Yeah. Would be regrows temp job. Courtyard sustained. Would you be? Yeah. Yeah. Price went from one million to two. Everybody is, the government said, like those witches from Eastwick, it ain't a secret to grandma. I speak with Peter Choules niggers back in my day life, bullet proof riches out the blue will come around and put a hold upon the light for any rapid Ashleigh. So stop sleeping. Hello. I don't know. Nagin was trying to get down before they can. Said it was right. I'll bring it to light. Either we fabricio get the job and we could split the cheder or separate us on whatever. As long as I live forever with them, I can't let you always get tear flesh and rip open your bare chest. We need that so you better wise up quick before it's too late for y'all to recognize this shit. Are you afraid of the dark? Okay. What about the wisdom of the club? If you tell me to let me see the madness for themselves and the witches, I put my mind to that or any kind of seatings. You know, I don't believe in things. And you know what has been done to you, to you or me. But how are you going to go against say you can't see you? Show me the drama, never see. Still like the belly of the beast, reminiscent of fellow rappers that went beneath. I mean, these streets, rappers from those that went to heaven, those that went down the soul rail is just a lesson that. All right. All right, so we're here now with the fucking gift. We're going to find out who's responsible. Yeah, we're going to find the street on, you know, the guy I showed you in the magazine going to find him, we're going to bust him. Yeah. So why don't we find these guys? Get them on tape. And then we can, like, blackmail them or something. Here we go. Boy, I got to walk the dog for the dread of dread. Show us the way. Want to show us the way? Show us away. Show. Let's start with. Since the attack, vitamin C. Oh, one hundred and fifty thousand units split up, 120000 units hell raiser up two hundred thousand units. Yeah, that's straight up. I'm looking at the numbers right now, man. This week, SoundScan, all it has since the attack.

I think she snatched Muchea. She'd run wild out to small fuck a man up here right now as we speak. I don't even know if this woman on the economy I think you made me think is going to jump off. I don't trust yo, we made men up bloody be yo. I actually just stay away from that fucking. Which really speaks to I mean, the way in which you're trying to find rape. Benzino now she's crazy. Think she snatched him up. Don't get him back. If you're watching the dog coming to get you, you'll be coming to get you. Rob Van Winkle, otherwise known as Vanilla Ice. Tell you what man is, which is got me going crazy. You know, she came to me at one of my shows. I say ice cores. In this trench coat and she like, opened up her trench coat and she was butt naked in there, I was like. She followed the show around and it was crazy, man, I didn't even know we were all talking about it. It was like, man, check out this beautiful chick. And then she wrote some stuff in the mirror, some kind of satanic message or something in the mirror. Being that my birthday's on Halloween, you know, I thought maybe it had something to do with that, because, you know, Hallow's Eve is like the biggest evil holiday of the year for these people. And then it wasn't until later that I learned that she was like the witch man. And I was like, whoa, I still have nightmares. I mean, this is no joke, man. Nightmares. You know, I just got to tell everybody, watch out for the hip hop witch. But she could be this fine chick and then completely flip the script and be Satan. Oh, I miss Josephine. I did. How are you?

The point is, they've been saying they've been attacked, but they really haven't. What I have concluded to bring the record Silvercup. Hip hop, which hip hop, which. So just a story about a hip hop, which is a story about bringing these people out, it's a lot like, come on, you think that I would be interested in such crap?

I've been working my butt off for you, and I haven't asked for anything. I just kind of figured when this promotion came up that I would get in and now you're going to give it to her. Well, can I say I know you must be upset about it? No, I know it's not even that I'm upset. I'm really hurt. When I first got here, I mean, we were sisters doing it together. No kidding. Just a stupid couple, Kitty. This has nothing to do about being sisters. This is business. And I have you know that I had her résumé on file for seven months before you walked in the door. Personally, I think that maybe she was more qualified for the position than you. I think, Kitty, more qualified than me. Look, there might be something else opening up soon. Whatever I want anything else. I deserve that position. All right. And just you just keep doing what you do, right? OK. Thank you very much, Mr.. Prize winner, I thank you. Yeah. Which at the one everyone. What is she saying it was rude of us. Describe for me if you indeed. Tokyo was attacked, remember the way men would like to ask you why, why, why, why, why not? This is coming your way to me, getting me up right now on the plane. And I just can't can't be a session. Now, right now, I'm leaving, I thought you told me to come down here because you're doing a story and you wanted me to come down here. Why don't you go write this? But I don't understand what he's saying. And you tell me about D.B. Washington, the witch story with the rapper's. How did she get hold of it? Isn't that Miss Josephine? She put this. Dan? The fucking risk is stupid. The bitch got my motherfucking trucks. The fucking hip hop, which bitch, son? No, you got Moshin. This is the fucking last fucking throw. This bitch got my fucking whipped son. Oh, so hula. Try this, the slogan at BASTID, Big Rock, a little Ratman, we out of here is hip hop witch bitch. Just fucking hands on the steering wheel. My first encounter with Miles is in Newport, and I was doing some promotional stuff on that. I have my daughter with me this beautiful afternoon to be in the mall, and I look up to the second level, and I thought I saw it and figured it was a fast moving figure . And she definitely was a hood rat, though I could tell she was from the hood. It didn't look suburban at all. She was definitely from the hood. It looked like she was smoking something. I wasn't really I couldn't make out if it was a cigaret or a blond, but she was whuppin and she was just standing there staring at me, go, you let me go. And I was plug. I mean, I'm not scared of anybody. But this this, you know, that's that's not supposed to be said. It could even be a flyball thing that I think I can remember telling me for a couple of times. So I'll go and I'll see if this is the squad thing. Maybe she just come in after like the hottest squad on the marquee and maybe she just coming up to the hottest female on the market, Dirty Harry brand name for. And I told my road manager, yo, I think she's after me. But no, nobody saw. So I'm just standing there looking. Whatever you doing, just keep it moving. I don't even want to talk about it anymore. I mean, yo, yo, yo. Which I'll tell you who else they await the wit purple here. Yo il powers yo. She was talking about Yeezus fleece stallion's. She's just that's my little daughter for me. I saw a little karate move but hip hop with yo what's chill. Really? I came to to give you some good news. I I've been noticing you having everything in order here, and I think you've been doing a great job. And there's another opportunity to be a trainee in another position has come available. Oh, really? Yeah. And I think that you'd be perfect. Well, basically, you know, I think that I would be perfect for the last one you gave away. I'm sorry. I did not I didn't do the right thing. I might have made a bad choice. I think you did. I think you did. And I'm sorry. Just isn't enough for me. But that's all you're going to give me then. So be it. But I'm a little busy right now, actually. Well, that being the case now in the future, that was the past. What I'm saying now is, is another opportunity. And in this opportunity, you have the opportunity to bring in your own story, and it could be great for you. And remember, while back when you mentioned this hip hop project. Remember this? Yeah, and I completely shot it down. Yeah. OK. I'm thinking that I'm changing my mind and I think that this could be a great story, a great lead, that it could really put crumpled prices over the top. Too bad. So sad. Sorry. I don't know anything. The guy that I was trying to get in contact with, basically, I can't find and I kind of stopped pursuing it. OK, what guy? You know what? You watch TV just like I do. But in the meantime, I have things to do and coffee to make. Hi, I'm Isabelle Gunsight or hip hop watch TV. I am still in front of Slim Shady Studios waiting for Eminem and Split to come out and do an interview. So I'm down on the goddamn floor. You know, same with this witch's finger up my ass or whatever. And I don't know what the fuck's going on because I'm still twitching and I'm tweaking.

Feel like I'm in a daze, going through a wicked phase into the stage of a nigga ready for death, ready for life. He married the mice, which has forced me to carry my striken to the grave. Still amazed at the outcome. The chicken may. Is it a phase or a way of life in the city? This type city know when these witches is trying to get me. They cast members got fake news trying to stick me. That's why I walk around with the state committee made up to talk about the wisdom of the club. Let me see them not as far back as they were, something which is out to get my heart beat at any time to see these things. You know, I don't believe in things. And you know what this means to you, to you or me. How are you going to go? Can't say you can't see you. Tell me. This is real nice.
