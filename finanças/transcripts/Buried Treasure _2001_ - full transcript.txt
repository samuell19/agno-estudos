[music playing] [golf swing] [thunder] HARRY: I'll put a marker down for mine. [chuckles] Well played, Ronald. I could hear the music today. That's all there was to it. Could just hear the music. [laughing] I hadn't heard it. I thought you were going to tellthe other one about the kid who comes home from school. - Oh, yeah, how does it go?- [inaudible] Oh, the one about the Himalayas. That. Phone call for you, love. Oh, tell them I'll ring them back. It's the police. Oh, well, tell them I won't ring them back. [laughing] It'll be someone from the officetrying to get a hold of me. Hang it up, love. All right. Cardinal rule of management--always play hard to get. Right, got to go. I've found a builder's merchant giving discount on paving slabs. I'll call round later then, if you like. Sure, yeah, right. Mr. Jenkins. Are you sure it's her? Driving license, sir. Now, that's easy. She can't drive. Well, she can drive, sir. Well, that she could drive. I see. It's been a while since we-- me and-- me and Annie, we don't get on. Oh, right. Well, we're going to needyou to formally identify her. I thought you said you know who she is. Yeah, but the coroner-- he needs a formal ID. I'm sorry, sir. The thing is, I haven't seen her for 10 years. Isn't there someone else? It's West Manchester Hospital. You need the coroner's office.It's-- By the south car park, I know. I've been before. The wife died there. CORONER: Is this Annie Rose Jenkins? Yes. She's thinner. Yes. That's Annie, my daughter. I don't understand. Why was she wearing her nightie in the car? No, no. That belongs to us. Her clothes were cut away after the accident. Oh, thought-- I was going to say, she wouldn't be seen-- she'd never wear anything like that. Can't you do something aboutthat light flicking on and off? Well, it's all wrong. Light like that in a place like this. You should have dimmers or side lights. Can't you do something about it? Take your time. I can leave you alone for afew moments, if you'd like. No, I don't think so. I don't think I'd like. If a room's got a window, thatmakes it a bedroom in my book. Put it on for 150, andsee if the line twitches. No, no, Knowsley Road's gone. Indian couple. He was big in artificial sweeteners. Yeah. Yeah. I've got to go. JILL HELLINGS: Mr. Jenkins? That's right. Jill Hellings in from social services. I've got the key. Well, let's get on with it, shall we? How long was she living here? About two years, accordingto council tax records. Two years? She was only six miles down the road. What was she trying to prove? [chuckles] I own that land downthere, you know, by the canal. Would you like me to waitoutside for a few minutes? People keep asking me that. What do you think I want to do? I haven't seen her for 10 years. You could be showing me anybody's flat. Did she have a kid staying here? Yeah, Annie lived here with her daughter. Didn't the office tell you that when they rang? Daughter? She had a daughter? I really thought you knew. I wouldn't have let you find out like that. Saffron's obviously pretty upset, too. Who's Saffron? That's your granddaughter's name. What sort of name's that? [elevator ding] I'm not sure this is such a good idea. She's just lost her mum. Exactly. So how's it going to affecther to meet a granddad she never knew she had? Oh, she knew she had you,just that she never met you. She told us that much-- that and the fact that she likes horses. Saffron, there's someone herethat would like to meet you. Saffron, this is your granddad. Mr. Jenkins, this is Saffron. Saffron. I'm, uh, I'm sorry about your mum. Where did you stay last night? I stayed with Mrs. [inaudible].. What did you say? I can't hear what she said. We've got emergency foster carers. It felt like the bestthing since we were having trouble getting hold of you. Well, you didn't have to ask me. I'm sure you know what you're doing. When are we going home? Could we just have a word? Look, it's out of the question. She can't come home with me. She needs-- well, whatevershe needs, I haven't got it, all right? If that's how you feel. Well, it's not just a case of how I feel. Don't you see? She-- she's nothing to do with me. I can't-- I mean, that little girl in there isn't anybody I know. If my wife was alive, well, perhaps. OK. Well, what's going to happen to her? Well, they're trying to trace her dad. But he lost touch some years ago. Well, that's right. Yeah, she should be withher dad at a time like this. Look, Mr. Jenkins, you've done nothing to reproach yourself about. Thank you. So-- so you knew about me, then. Annie-- your mum talked about me a lot, did she? What do you like to eat? Anything, really. Is that anything with or without chips? You don't look like Mum. No. No, she took after her mother. Were you-- were you there when she died? No, not really. Not really? She just dropped me off atschool on the way to work. Oh, I see. Then there were ambulancesgoing and police cars. So assembly were canceledbecause Miss Lewis said she couldn't hear herself think. We all went to the window. Even the teacher looked out. It were great for a while. You could see the motorwayfrom our classroom-- no maths or anything. Then Miss Lewis came in our classroom and whispered something toour form teacher, Miss Hadip. And she-- she called my name out. So this is your bedroom for the time being. South facing with en suite bathroom and fully fitted wardrobe. I'll get you some sheets sorted. Is this Mum's old room? No. No, it isn't, no. Is that where you'd rather sleep, mm? Come on. It's a long time since anyone was in here. Right, right. Pizza all right for tea? And what's your favorite flavor? Tomato and cheese. Do you like pepperoni? Right, extra pepperoni it is. I'll help with her if you want, Harry. You've just got to ask. No. No, it'll be all right. - No trouble. It's just that, you know, if-- if she sees us together, she might get confused. I am not going to take over your life, Harry. I'm not going to move in and leave my knickers drawing on your radiator. I can manage, all right? I can manage, Estelle. SAFFRON: Mummy. [crying] Mummy. [TEARFULLY] Mummy. Mummy. [crying] [thunder] [golf swing] Oh, good God in Heaven. One over for Thomas. That's a 5. [faint music] Saffron. Saffron. Saffron, what is the problem? Saffron, what are you doing? You're miles behind. You've not even filled in my score. Does that count as a shot when you kicked the ball out the bushes? Do you know, Harry, I don't remember you ever mentioning a daughter. Of course I did. Course I did, didn't I, Thomas? And she works in the filmbusiness in America, you say. Anything I'd have seen her in? Well, she's more on the financial side. Ah. And her husband-- what is he exactly? Well, I think we can see what he is, looking at the lovely Shafron. Saffron. He's in films, too. Oh. Is he the colored chap in"Lethal Weapon"-- you know, the partner? - No. Oh, no, no. He's a producer. Ah. HARRY: Cute little thing, isn't she? Yeah. So is he feeding you all right? I think he would if he knew what I liked. Well, you should tell him. I mean, he won't bite you, you know? He might get angry. No. He's a big teddy bearonce you get to know him. [chuckles] She'll be the next Carol Vorderman. Really? Really? Good at sport at all, is she? The Jensens will come in with 25%, but they want 50% back in profits. Cheeky buggers. You lead someone to a pot of gold, the first thing they do is piss in it. There's a problem with the surveyor, sir. OK, say 35% on net and not trade-in. We can't do that till we've solved the problem with the surveyor, sir. I keep hearing the word problem, Ryan, and it keeps coming out of your mouth. I'm late, sir. Get another surveyor, then another until we find one that says different. Is that ethical? Do you want a fat bonus or the door marked Exit? Mr. Jenkins-- Read my lips. Bonus or bugger off? Bonus, sir. Good. Then as far as we're concerned,the only ethics I know is accounting next to Kent, all right, Graham? Lee, sir. Lee. Will you stop that rocking? Yes, sir. Not you, her. Saffron. [ON TV] It's the jack of clubs. And then you just do thatunderneath the handkerchief. And that's magic. [ON TV] There are reallyonly five basic tricks-- vanishing, appearing, transformation-- Saffron. [ON TV] --turning one thing into another. I got you this. I didn't know what you liked. So I got you one with all the hits on. [ON TV] And levitation-- rising into the air. [clatter] Thanks. [ON TV] Ta-da. I was looking at that. Well, try looking at the warzone round the sofa instead. I used to have a carpet. Now I've got a scale model of Beirut. I never touched any Beirut. Oof, give me strength. Saffron, this sofa is a much-loved fixture. It isn't used to abuse. It's part of the tastefuldecor that runs throughout. Don't you see? That cup's not mine. Oh. Oh, right then. I'm sorry. I hadn't realized that that cup made everything else look untidy. I want to see Mum. - Don't change the subject.- I want to see Mum. And don't walk away from me. I want to see Mum. [YELLING] I want to see Mum. I want to see Mum. [sighs] She-- your Mum looks pretty, doesn't she? She's cold. I chose the dress. I didn't know what she liked. I didn't-- it was hangingup behind the door. It was her favorite. Good. Have you got a comb? A what? Her hair's all wrong. I need a comb. Well, you can't. Not here. There's probably rules. [sighs] Where is her soul? Well, it had gone up to Heaven, you see? How did it get there? Mm, by Heavenly means. Does God send a bucket down on a rope? Mm, perhaps. But a heavenly bucket? Yeah. With a gold rope, I expect. I expect so, yeah. Right. [footsteps] [knocks] Saffron. [knocks] You have to let me in. I've got something for you. What's that? I think you know what it is. Saffron? She said she'd always look after me. She will. She will. How can she if she'sgone up in Heaven's bucket? How can she? That's a nice one. That's you, isn't it? Before you got wrinkled. That's right. Wrestling, probably. You were always wrestling. She told you about the wrestling? We'd wrestle, too, me and Mum-- Jackie Pallo and Mick McManus. She said they were biggerand braver than Hulk Hogan. They were. They were. Don't you think it's time you were in bed? You've got a big day tomorrow. Granddad? Yeah? You know the funeral? Yeah. Can I wear something? Can I wear the lastthing that Mum bought me? Course you can. Yeah, she'd like that. Course you can. You can wear what you like. [music playing] Not much of a send-off. It must have meant something to Saffron. She needed it. And I dare say it meant something to you. It meant that I never gotthe chance to know her again, ask her why she was beingso bloody pig-headed, ask her how she felt aboutbreaking her mother's heart. You can't still be angry with her, Harry. Can't I? Can't I? Can't I? This is the daughter thatwouldn't even talk to me at her own mother's funeral. [thunder] I'm sorry. It's just this and Saffron. I mean, she's so-- I mean, she's not normal, is she? She's as normal as anykid who's been through what she's been through. Have you-- have you spokento the Social Services? They haven't a clue where her dad is. They don't want her going into care. And neither do you. Well, no. But I'm not cut out forthis, not at my time of life. Well, you don't seem to bedoing such a bad job of it so far. [beeping] What the hell has she done now? [roaring flames] [screaming] Bloody hell! What have you done? You all right, love? You all right? HARRY: You could've gotten the lot of us killed, you silly little beggar. Harry, she's upset. No one got hurt. That's the main thing. SAFFRON: It caught fire. Well, I can see that. I've already got your mum in ashes. What were you trying to do? Burn yourself into a frazzleso I've got a set of bookends? - Harry. - Don't Harry me. She's old enough to know better. She's just been to her mother's funeral. So that means she can dowhat she likes, does it? No. But you don't take it out on her just 'cause you're still fighting with her mum. Oh, been reading themself-help books again, have we? Is that what they teach you at barmaid college-- platitudes for the elderly drunk? Why can't you be like a granddad in books? Why can't you buy me sweets--- What? --and give me money forno reason, and rub me head, and say nice things? [sighs] I think-- I'm just-- we're all a bit upset. Maybe we should all try a bit harder. I was trying harder. I was trying to make chips for all of us. But now I'm not going to try anymore. I knew you had your faults, Harry. But I didn't know you could be that cheap. There's this rocking and then this fire. No, I'm not saying shestarted it deliberately, no. Yeah, yeah, I can cope. I just think she'd be better off with her dad. I found these checks he'd been sending. Yeah, yeah, I realize that. Look, this is a tough time for me, you know? I've got this business thing happening. OK. OK. OK, it's a bloody nightmare. Yes, I can't cope. That's what you people like to hear, isn't it? Yes. Yes, I am sure foster parentswould have more idea than me. I did try, you know? What are you doing? I'm moving out. You don't want me here. I do. You never wanted me here. I heard you talking on the phone. Well, where you going to go? Here somewhere, where they want me. Plenty of places to liveround there, are there, for 9-year-old girls? Hammersmith Bridge. That's where my dad lives. You know where he lives? Yeah, it's near here. I went there with him once. Saffron, if you knew all along, why didn't you say something? No one asked me. Well, look, you can't go downthere all on your own, love. You're too young. You'll have to come with me then, won't you? [music - all saints, "alone"] What the bloody hell is this? All Saints. Where is my Neil Diamond collection? ALL SAINTS [SINGING ON RADIO]:Not gonna, never gonna, don't-- don't wanna, wanna end up alone. Saffron? ALL SAINTS [SINGING ON RADIO]:I need to sit back and pick out, it's about the way I make you feel. Saffron? What is it? What is it? Saffron, for god's sake. [squealing tires] - No! No! Turn around. Turn around! For god's sake. No. - No! Now be quiet. We can't go on the motorway. Saffron, why can't we go on the motorway? 'Cause that's where Mum died. Saffie, your mum died on a different motorway. It's still a motorway. [phone ringing] Hello. The thing is about AllSaints is they're cool, right, but just like girls you go to school with. They don't look like anygirls I went to school with. Ready? Yep. That's Shaznay. Yeah. Larry, Curly, and Moe. That's just the sort of thing Mum would've said. Well, I taught her something then. Yeah, bad jokes. Granddad? HARRY: Hm? Are you going to marry Estelle? Estelle? Estelle is just a friend. She likes you. Does she? Oh, good. I like her. How much? As much as you like Grandma? No. No, nothing like that. But it's different, you know. She's a very nice woman. I need to stop again. It's only been half an hour. I need to stop. Are you sure you haven't played before? ELECTRONIC VOICE: You have won. You have hit the jackpot. You have won. You have hit the jackpot. Next player please. All right. [clang] That was just a practice shot. Don't cheat, Granddad. Well, how else am I going to win? You don't have to win all the time. Mum said, there's nothing wrongwith just enjoying the game. Well, your mum had a lot of funny ideas. She said that's why we never met you 'cause you had funny ideas about us. And it's this put for the championship. [SING-SONG] I won, I won, I won, I won. Remember, Saffron, you don'thave to win all the time. [SING-SONG] I won, I won. Just enjoy the game, like me. Admit it, I beat you inside out. Yeah.

This is a family establishment. Hello? No. No, no. It's been fine. Yeah, it's just taking longer than we thought. The scenic route. Yeah, yeah, she's fine. She's fine. She's asleep. Well, Neil Diamond's real old stuff, right? Yeah, it's the All Saints thatare really mint these days. Look, Estelle, I really appreciate you-- well, you looking after the house and that. Yeah. Night. [MUSIC - ALL SAINTS, "NEVER EVER"] ALL SAINTS [SINGING ON RADIO]: Never ever have I ever felt so low. When you gonna take me out of this black hole? Never ever have I ever felt so sad. The way I'm feeling-- HARRY: But the check's made out to my daughter. CLERK: I'm sorry, sir. We're not authorized to givean account holder's address from the account number. Get me the manager. Sir. Just get me the manager. They give a kid a stripedshirt and a nametag, and he thinks he's Gordon Brown. That's 315. Yeah. Yeah. Ronald, I know it's asking a lot. But by my reckoning, you owe me. Yeah, well, you always told meyou could do what you liked. Yeah. Cheers, mate. You need contacts in this world, Saffie. Never forget that. With contacts, there's always a way. You all right? Now, this dad of yours, do you remember which side he lived on? Never been here before. How do you mean? This is the bridge from thepostcard where your dad lived. I made it up. I've never been here. Then what the heck did you say you had for? It looked nice. I saw it on the telly. Mum brought me the card back when she came down here because Iwas always going on about it. I'm sorry. Sorry? Sorry? I take two days off work. We're standing here becauseyou liked the look of a bridge? I wanted to come. Well, take a good look. It's just a dirty river, a load of traffic, one liar, and one idiot. I wanted to tell you, but I couldn't. Well, that's you all over, isn't it, honey? Yes, go on. That's right. Walk off, like you always do, like that going to solve everything. Saffron! [horns] [squealing tires] Saffron! Saffron! [traffic] [sirens] [saxophone] [organ grinder] [pa announcement] Saffron! Saffron! Saffron! Saffron! Saffron! [music playing] Don't ever-- don't you ever. I was-- I was scared. You had me so scared. [kiss] [blowing air] Dad don't want me to find him. You don't know that. The last birthday card Igot was when I was 6, right. Well, your mum might not havewanted him to get in touch. Why can't he find me? I'll tell you what. We'll make a deal with fate. We'll stay on for a coupleof days and enjoy ourselves. And if we're meant to find your dad, we will. Now, how about that for a deal? And I don't have to eat vegetables. Nothing remotely healthyneed pass your lips. [music - "putting on the ritz"] [WINSTON CHURCHILLVOICE] Never in the field of human conflict. [chuckling] [boinging] [tap dancing] It was mint today. Good. SAFFRON: You can sing me to sleep if you like. Sing? I can't sing. Mum told me you used to. Did she? And did your mum sing to you? Sometimes, if she weren't too tired, stuff from the olden days-- the Beatles and that. Uh-huh. SAFFRON: Go on, Granddad. Right. Right. Like a lullaby. [SINGING] Close your eyes and I'll kiss you. Tomorrow, I'll miss you. Remember, I'll always be true. And while I'm away, I'll write home every day. And I'll send all my loving to you. All my loving, I will send to you. All my loving, darling I'll be true. Nope, that wasn't one of them. Sorry. It doesn't matter. It was OK. Mint? No, just OK. You've done a great job, Annie. She's a smashing kid. She's a bit stubborn, like her mum. But she's-- she's good to be with. She's good fun. And she makes me feel young again. And this time, I'm not going to mess up, Annie. This time, I'm going to be there for her. All right? [phone ringing] Estelle? Oh. Oh, no. Sorry, Ronald, I was expecting a call. Oh, have you? No, no. Fire away. Yeah, fire away. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks, Ronald. Thanks a lot. I owe you one. Yeah, sure. Yeah, see you. [crumples paper] [music playing] Saffron. Saffie. We've found him. We've found your dad. So what are we doing today then? I thought we might pop in and see your dad. That's great, isn't it? Isn't it? Yeah, yeah, it's great. He lives in Hackney. I know. I can read. Bit of a tight squeeze, is it? It's OK. We can get you a bigger knapsack, if you like. [chuckles] I bet Nike don'tcall them knapsacks, do they? Why are you pretending a bag's for me? I didn't know I was. Yes, you were. You were making a joke about a bag when it's just a bag in the end. Well-- well, that'ssometimes what grownups do when they don't know what to say. When they feel bad. Why should I feel bad? 'Cause you tricked me into staying. And now you've got what you wanted all along, 'cause you dumped Mum. And now you're dumping me. Hey, that's not what's happened here, Saffron. That's not what's happened. You're just like Mum. When she got the sack, she made jokes about moving in that horrible flat, about the noises at night,and sharing a toilet and that. And all the time, it's 'cause she felt bad. You're just like Mum. Now, you listen, Saffron. I'm just trying to do what's right. [lock clicks] It was you that wanted to come down here. You want to see your dad, don't you? Aye? I'm scared. Well, what is there to be scared of? What if he doesn't like me? He will. Who couldn't like you? You didn't like me, did you? No. No, that is not true. I was-- I was scared. So you had a tough timewhen your mum lost the job. It was all right. Mum cried, but I told her shedidn't like the job anyway. She should've come to see me. SAFFRON: She did. What? When was this? One afternoon we went to putflowers on Grandma's grave. Then we got on the bus to near your house. Well, was I out or what? I don't know. Just got another bus and went home again. Right. Right. Well, we are here, andwe're not going to run away. You stay put. [car door opens] [knock at the door] Yo. Mr. Johnson? No, I can't help you, mate. He does live here, though, doesn't he? Yeah, but he's not here right now. Well, when will he be back? Well, will you tell him a Mr. Jenkins called? Tell him he can get hold of me at this number. All right? Shit. Wait. Wait! Wait! Stop! Wait! Stop! Stop! Wait! And then she chose the green dress because she knew her sisterreally wanted the red dress. And you know what happened when she put the green dress over her head? What? HARRY: It turned into a dress of pure gold. The good fairy had rewardedher for being kind. Did she sell the dress? Well, maybe a bit of thecolor, some of the hem. No. Did she buggery sell the dress? She'd learnt her lesson. It is better to be kind. Do you think my dad will be kind? I'm sure he will, yeah. Think he'll ring up tonight? HARRY: I expect so, yeah. If I get to know my dad,and I still like you best, can I come back home with you? Well, let's wait and seewhat happens, shall we? Promise me. HARRY: Promise you what? You'll take me back if I don't like it. Of course. I promise. [phone ringing] Hello. Speaking. Who? Who? Well, look, no. No. No, I'll come down there. All right. Oh, hello. Mr. Jenkins? I'm Martha Johnson, Luke's mum. Right, right. Annie's dad, Saffron's granddad. I know. Luke realized that's who you must be. Shall we get a drink or something? Yeah. Why didn't he tell me who he was? Do you answer the door tostrangers who know your name? Yeah. Well, you're not from Hackney, are you? I just wanted Saffron and him to meet. What does Annie think about this idea? Because if you've done this and not told her, it could end in trouble, you know? Annie's dead. She died in a car crash last week. [gasps] I'm sorry. Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. [sighs] Oh, that's a terrible thing. Yeah. Yes, it is. We weren't-- Annie and I-- we weren't in contact. I didn't even know about Saffron. It's all come as a bit of a shock. Of course. Is Saffron your only grandchild? Yeah. Yeah. Well, am I going to meetthis granddaughter of mine? Or are you going to keep her hidden away? Well, actually, she's asleep right now. Mr. Jenkins, I've waiteda long time for this day. [door opens] Mm. [sniffles] [WHISPERING] Thank you. [WHISPERING] Keep it. I've got an in on slight seconds with a linenware house in Rochdale. Come on. So you are Luke after all. LUKE: That's right. MARTHA: Hello, Saffron. I'm your grandmother. And that means I get a great big hug. Oh. Come in. So, Luke, this is Saffron. Saffron, well, this is your dad. Hiya. Your mum tells me thatyou're some sort of student. Yeah, teacher training. Oh, you look lovely, just like your mum. I'll get the tea. No sugar for me, thanks, Martha. MARTHA: Right you are. HARRY: And Saffron will have anything fizzy, with a busload of E additives. [chuckles] Or water will be fine, if you've got nothing like that. MARTHA: Oh, that's good. I don't know many littlegirls her age who drink water. Well, she's good as gold. She'll eat anything. Oh, that's good. That's good. She's got a big appetite. Now, who do you think shegets that off, me or you? [chuckles] Wouldn't like to say. MARTHA: Well, I hopeyou've got a sweet tooth. Sorry about your mum. MARTHA: We've got cake and-- Why didn't you answer thedoor when we came yesterday? MARTHA: I'll put the kettle on. Well, you never know who it's going to be. Why did you run after the car in your socks? Because I wanted to catch you up. Why are you sorry about my mum? Well, because I loved her. So did I. Oh, I can't get over it. I thought we'd lost her. Now there she is, all grown up. Well, you'll be able tomake up for lost time now. Oh, I'm going to spoil herrotten while she's down here. That's right. I bet you will. So what did you make of London then? So, Luke, teacher training, eh? Let's hope you don't haveto teach kids like me. I don't think there's much chance of that. You don't get much time todo anything else, I expect. Oh, he's never got any time. When he's not studying,it's football, girlfriends, computers, something or other. Very full, then, your life. Not so full that I can'tmake room for my own daughter. Oh, easy as that, is it? Hm? You know all about it. Well, it was certainly an eye-opener for me. MARTHA: There you are. And I'd done it before, of course. Yeah. Annie had some very, um, warm memories. Granddad likes whiskey. Sorry, love, what? Granddad drinks whiskey in a big glass. Do they sell that? Does who sell it? At your golf club. If they don't, you just have a beer. Oh. [chuckles] [MUSIC PLAYING - ALL SAINTS, "NEVER EVER"] Ta. Cheers. So who did you think I was exactly when I came to the door? Does it matter? I just wondered what you were so scared of. We're on. That was All Saints, eh? [billiard balls rolling] Did Annie talk about memuch after she left home? Not really. How do you mean, not really? Did she ever mention coming up? Doubt it. What about her mum dying? Didn't she talk about that? Look, we'd already split up when Annie found out she was pregnant. What? She only told me I was a father a year after Saffron was born. Oh, all right. I get it. And you didn't want to know. No. I went to Manchester and foundthem, said I'd move up there, make a go of it. And? She didn't want me back, all right? All right? Twice she changed addresswithout telling me. And twice I checked her down, all right? Second time I found her, shewas with this other bloke. I said I still wanted to support Saffron. And I sent her a check every month. But then I noticed thechecks weren't being cashed. I went up to Manchester to findher, but she'd moved again. So you finally took the hint. All that running she did, but she never ran back to you, Harry. I would have welcomed her with open arms. Yeah, like you really would. You know nothing about my family. I know enough! I know the reason me and you never met was because she was scared of how you'd take her going out with a black boy. I knew that made me so angrythat I couldn't stay with her. So if you're looking forsomeone to blame for the fact that your daughter never came home, take a good, long lookin the mirror, all right? [siren] All right? - All right, son. Let him go and back up. Hey, no, no, no. Come on, lads. [slam] No use for that. - Sorry, sir. No, no. It's what you fellas call a domestic. - Harry, shut it! - Got him, sir. No, look. I'm going to put him in the car. His name is Luke Johnson. Step back from the car, sir. We're having a family row. Oy, oy. - That's it. - [inaudible]. - Get in the car. - This is the truth. - Get in the car. It-- it's a family row, I'm telling you. I'll just settle her down. And then maybe we could have a nightcap. I don't think so. Oh, come on. Don't be like that. It's years since I wasarrested outside a boozer. I'm glad it's funny for you, Harry. MARTHA: How did your wife get on with Annie? Joyce? Oh, she could get Annie to do things without Annie knowing it. Me? I'd be up there, ranting and raving with her. Even after she left us, Joycethought she'd come back. And maybe she would have done if Joyce had lived. But, well, it broke her heart. She died six months after Annie left home. She lived for her, you see. You must miss her-- your wife. I miss me daughter, too. I just didn't realize it till now. Do you like, um, apples? How about tomatoes? Do you like Tommy Hilfiger? It's all right. Um, rollerblading? Netball? Football? They're all right. Is there anything that you like that you'd like to tell me about? Wrestling. I like wrestling. [yelling] HARRY: Yes, come on, mate! Yay! Did you like the wrestling then? Yeah. Yeah, I'll take you to the States, if you like, see the real thing. Great. How are you getting on with your dad? He's cool. Oh, good. I'm glad you think so. He would be a good dad. I'm glad to hear it. He knows all the names of thedifferent trainers and that. Well, that's always a verygood quality in a father. Yeah. I'm glad you like him, love. Where are we going? HARRY: You'll see. [turn signal] The price of it, I thought I'dbe looking round a mansion. There's two bathrooms. So when did you decide to move down here? It's not for me. There's a room just for playing in. Can I go and look at the garden, Dad? LUKE: What did you say, Harry? Well, Dad, I've got tothink ahead, knowing I've got a granddaughter. And if it's going to workout for the pair of you, you're going to needsomewhere to live, aren't you? LUKE: Whoa, whoa. It may have passed you by,Harry, but I've got a home. Yeah, your mum's. I know. But it's not exactly the bestneighborhood in the world, is it? Can I go out in the garden? Go and wait in the car, Saffron. What do you think you're doing?Hm? Hm? Telling me how to run my life? Well, if Saffron's going to move down here, she'll need somewhere decent to live. I can afford it. It couldn't be that I like it where I am. Nobody likes it there. You pretend to like it becauseyou can't do any better. And you would know, would you? Yes, I would. I was brought up in a place a lot worse, surrounded by people like you. People like me? People who settle for what they've got because they didn'thave the sense or the chance to better themselves. So they could turn outto be like you, you mean? Yeah. Yeah, all right, why not? What's so bad about that? You-- you're a joke. You sell overpriced houses topeople who can't afford them. A bloke who is so worriedthat his own granddaughter might not love him, that hebombards her with presents? Why? Because he thinks he can buy everything, because his own daughter died hating him. And he thinks now he can have another go. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! If it's [inaudible],, me andGranddad would be [inaudible].. And now you're going to spoil it. I hate you! HARRY: Come on. Come on, Saffie. It's all right. It's all right. Me and Luke, we're just having a chat. I want to go home. Yeah, let's do that. SAFFRON: I want to go home with Granddad. I want to go back. I hate it here. We're not going back. I can't, not tonight. I thought this is what you wanted. I did. I mean, you saw me. I tried to be generous. He just threw it back in me face. Never tried harder in my life. He just didn't want to know. You'll never be friends with Dad and them. You are the one thatwanted to come back, Saffron. We're doing this because of you. I left my Walkman behind. What? We'll have to go back. I left my Walkman behind. I'll buy you another one. But I want that one. We are not going back. Why not? Because I say so. And one day, you'll see that I'm right. [music playing] Dad. Saffron. SAFFRON: We're back, Grandma. She said she'd left her Walkman. You could have just got her another. I know. That's what I said. She wanted to come back. You'd better come in. We'd better get on. So what's happening today then? Dad's taking me to play tennis. Oh, great. Good. Morning, Luke. All right. Hiya. So, Luke, tennis. What? 40 love and that-- tennis on the agenda for you and Saffron today. That's right, yeah. That's right. [music playing] [inaudible chatter] [giggling] LUKE: Rah. SAFFRON: [laughing] You should've come to see me more. I know. You should've tried really hard, even if Mum didn't want you to. I know. You're a lot like your mum, aren't you? Am I? Yeah, she spoke her mind, too. Is that why you didn't come to see me, because you were afraid of Mum? It's part of it. It's complicated. No, it's not. I wanted you to come. You should have found me,and found me, and found me. Your mum was very-- we were both very angry. If I'd stayed, I-- I don't think I would've beena very good dad, not then. I'm sorry. This isn't really my sort of thing. Why did you come back, Harry? We were in this little chef. And, well, I suppose I was shouting a bit. And-- and then something went, you know, inside. And-- Mm. And I knew that, well,I was tearing her apart-- Saffron, you know, like Annie. Mm-hm. And, well, I don't want tomake Saffron feel that she has to make a choice, I suppose. Well, I think you did theright thing coming back. You really think this will make a difference? Oh, nothing a man loves more than a full belly. Luke's so suspicious of me, he'll think I'm trying to poison him. Well, do you blame him? Well, it's not every day youget offered a house, you know, and at London prices. Do you blame him for being suspicious? Well, no, I suppose not. Oh. [chuckles] Mm. [kiss] Guava punch, anyone? Guava punch? You never made that before. I've never had a granddaughter before. Mm, this is nice, Mum. Well, Harry did all the hard work. I told you he could cook. Told you. He learned after Grandma went up in a bucket. It's a long story. Chicken, jerk? Um, I think that shouldbe jerked chicken, Harry. I know what I mean. [chuckling] The first time I saw Annie, she had a face like a shriveled prune, little skinny legs with the hospital tag. And she had this great long head. These ventouse deliveries,you see, stretches the head. I didn't know that. I thought, hell, I'm going to have to buy this child a balaclava. [chuckling] Her eyes never changed. No, even then, they stared up atme from that buggy little face. And they said, so I'm here, buster. Let's get on with it. LUKE: She was at a bus stop. She was soaking wet, and she'djust missed the bus she wanted. Then she flagged a cab down. I don't get it. Was that it? Didn't you say anything? No. But I made damn sure I was atthat bus stop the next day, and the day after that until I saw her again. And that time, I made sure I said something. What did you say? I said-- I thought it was dead romantic. I said-- now, you've gotto remember, I was only 19 at the time. Get on with it. I looked at Annie. And I said, I've been waitingfor this moment my whole life. And what did she say? I know. The buses around here areterrible, aren't they? [laughing] I don't know how old I was. But I was sick. And she was kind. And I was wrapped up with Mom on the settee. And she cuddled me better,and she smelled of, you know, she smelled of-- Yeah, we know. We know. SAFFRON: Mum would'veliked this, wouldn't she? The food? She'd have loved it. [chuckles] No, I mean this. I mean us laughing and that,all at the same time, together. Yeah, she would, sweetheart. Your mum would've loved it. Come on, darling. Help me slide the plates, hm? Then it's time for bed, young lady. Only if I get a story, Granddad. Oh, I'm-- I'm feeling a bit bushed tonight, sweetheart. Why don't you let your dad tell you one, huh? No, I want it to be you. So which one is it going to be then? Are you still mad with Luke? No. No, of course not. You still going to buy that house for us? Well, that really dependson Luke, doesn't it? Don't you like it here? Yeah, it's mint. But when I start school, it'dbe nice if I live nearer to it. When do you start school? On Monday. I wanted to start this week. But Dad said he had to fill in forms about picking me up and that. Well, right. So you and your dad havegot school sorted out then, have you? That's good. Do you think that they do art? I'm sure they do. I know it's none of my business, Luke. But for God's sake, be a gooddad, not just for Saffron but for you, because I know what it's like to let your kid down and not have a chance to make it up to her. And it's a feeling I wouldn't wish on anyone. Come on. You did your best. You didn't get on. I had rows with my dad. It happens. I was stubborn, and I was proud. And I wanted to win the argument. And what was it worth? Like you said, she died hating me. She, um, she didn't hate you. One of the reasons we argued so much was that she carried on lovingyou, making excuses for you, thinking of ways to get you to love her again. Really? Though she did talk about me then. Yep. She was always going on about how much fun you were when she was a kid and that. I was good at that bit-- tickling, wrestling, rude rhymes. It's easy, that stuff, [TEARFULLY] at least it was for me. But it-- it's knowing when to step back, let them get on with it. That's the hard part. Knowing when to step back, let go. [sniffling] Bloodylager-- always gets to me. [music playing] [running water] [door shuts] You're back then? Well, why didn't you ring? The front door was wide open. Any bugger could have walked in. Well, thanks for lookingafter the house, Estelle. Nice to see you. I'm just saying, you know,the front door wasn't locked. Burglars could have been upstairs. You wouldn't have heard them. So everything workedout down there all right? Saffie settled in? Yeah, yeah, fine. Go on with her dad, did she? That's right, yeah, in the end. So that's good, isn't it? I'm her granddad. I'm not her dad. And she's not Annie. That's all there is to it, all right. [music playing] SAFFRON [SINGING]: All myloving I will give to you. All my loving, darling I'll be true. And while I'm away, I'll write home everyday. And I'll send all my loving to you. [giggling] If I get to know my dad and still like you best, can I come back home with you? Look, until I find a dogthat shits gold nuggets, we are going to be doing business. So you better get used to it. Why didn't you tell meJamison had got cold feet? Why did you agree to delay payments? Why did you change the coffee? We couldn't get hold of you, sir. Saffie. [chuckles] [phone ringing] Hello. Right. That's 1 and 1/4 points above tomorrow's base rate, fixed for three years, the usual penalty clauses. I knew you'd say yes in the end. Right, I want both of youdown to Canalside now. I'm still not sure we cancome in for the full 2 million. What? I've been beating investorsoff with a yard brush for the past six months. Now you turn round and sayyou can't raise the ackers? Well, I wasn't saying we can't, Harry. Just a couple of questions on the survey. For god's sake. [music playing] Do you know what? I can't do it. Now, come on, Harry. Now, we are interested. No. I mean, I can't do this. I'm lying to you. This site is a white elephant. The foundations under thisbuilding are too shallow. What about this survey? I got a bent surveyor to do them. You. You're in charge. You're the rightproportion of snake to man. I don't enjoy lying anymore. You don't suppose I could havethat in writing, do you, sir? Forge my signature like you'vebeen doing all these years on your expenses claims, Tony. Lee, sir. Whatever. You're in charge. [music playing] [laughing and talking] PATRON: He said, how much do I owe you? [chatter] [laughing] Oh, hey, the wanderer returns. Has Estelle been here? Look, Harry, do you fancymaking up a charity four-handed with the captain tomorrow? She's usually working by now, isn't she? Hey, Harry, I've remembered that joke. Kid comes home from school. Says, Dad, where's the Himalayas? Heard it, have you? Estelle. [bell] I thought you should all know that I'm going to London for goodto be near my granddaughter while she's growing up. And if she will, I'dlike this wonderful woman to come with me. Oh? What do you say? How long is this good moodgoing to last for, Harry? Hm? 10 days? 10 minutes? Look, Estelle, I knowthat I've not always been as attentive as I might be. Harry, you haven't eventold anyone about us till now. Look. Look, if I've learned one thing-- if one thing has got intothis thick head of mine these last weeks is that youcan fill your life with missed chances or grab chances. And I'm-- well, from now on,I'm going to be a grabber. So come here and let me grab you, you lovely little so-and-so. [chuckling] BYSTANDER: Ooh. Lovely. You going to come with me? Give me 5 minutes to think about it, and 10 minutes to pack. BYSTANDER: Yeah. [applause] [music playing] Hello, little love. How are you? Nice to see you again. [chuckling] MARTHA: Hello. HARRY: Hi, Martha. How are you, Martha? MARTHA: All right. Hello. Estelle. [music playing] Are you ready? Ready, Granddad. Annie, Saffron chose thisplace because she knows you would have liked it here. And we can't think of a better reason than that. God bless, love. [music playing]
