You'll pay half a crooked groat or I'll smash the lot to splinters. That's just what I'm afraid of. Hurry up! Here's another one coming. What have you got there? - Linen. You'll pay half a crooked groat or I'll tear the whole lot to shreds. You won't and I won't pay either! You'll pay linen-dealer. No, I won't. Yes, you will. - No, I won't. What? - So what! Come on. And why not really? I'll pay and only too pleased to. But why should you pay after all! Tell you what - don't pay! Oh, no - of course, I'll pay. OK! OK! Take it and do me a kindness! Well, if you insist. - And friends for life! What have you got there, Grannie? Healing herbs, Martin. You know me? - How could I not know you! I nursed you often enough when you were small. How big is your kingdom? Jack in his seven-league boots would take a week to cross it. A very big kingdom! All the best, and be good! I'll be good, Grannie! Grannie, who are you? I told you - the Herb Woman. I know, but who are you really? If I told you, you wouldn't believe me. "Why is it called "My Kingdom"?" It's your kingdom, isn't it? We know that, but the King doesn't. He thinks it's all his - and so he "calls himself "King We the First"." I don't want to be King I want to be... I don't know what I want ... besides a King doesn't need to - if he doesn't want to. A stitch or two there! - Now it's all right. Well, how does it suit me? Oooh... Oooh yes, or oooh no? Oooh yes! Just as well! I am marrying off my daughter. Which one? I don't know myself which one. And whom will she marry? Smart arse! Who can a Princess marry but a Prince? Hey, you! Are the Princes on our soil? Since dawn a glassmaker, a linen-dealer and an old woman have crossed frontiers. Quite a big tourist traffic. The Princes should have been here. They have announced themselves ... A sharp pain in my shoulder. And-so-on! Quick, quick! Your Majesty's health's most humble servant. A pain like a dagger - there! Pinosa Prickitis. What on earth's that? - No illness dare attack you - you're as healthy as a turnip. As a turnip? What a vulgar comparison. Well, say, as a fish - a gold fish. It was a pinprick. You grudge me even a proper illness. You have no real love for me. Ooooh. When I die, you'll not shed a tear. I'll shed one - an enormous one. Would you weep for me? Would, and how much! Show me how you'd weep. Oh, my king! - Stop now. That's enough. Show me how you would cry. And you? And how would you weep all together? No! Stop! This is no weeping for me! I'm the one who should weep most ... but of course, as the corpse, I couldn't! And you would wring your hands? How would you wring your hands? That's no wringing! Show them! This is how you wring! And I'll have a look for the Princes. Practise it a bit! - Wring! Give it to me. You have no idea! You must look and not gape. What's this ... what's this I see? Must be looking abroad. Of course, you've got it at 'infinite'. Now I'm at home ... Home sweet home! A kingdom like a picture-book. There's a dozen of these little Kubáts! And there they've begun a second dozen. We'll need to order a new census. Well, there might be more of them coming! Look there! The basket-maker and the seamstress are married. Oh yes! - I didn't know. What a woman! But not a trace of the Princes. As soon as you sight them, report! To me! You fetch the bride - and remember ... she's your future Queen. That's enough! You have three daughters, Sire ... which will be my future Queen? True. Bring the three of them! And while I'm getting my regalia ... I'll think it over. Turn the other way - the King is leaving by the secret door. I know, Mary, I never can find anything. I think only of myself and don't know what I want. As if I heard you. Only this time it's my ermine cloak. I'm marrying my daughter - no job for a man, Mary. If only you were here to help me. Nobody advises me ... nobody loves me ... And I'm not exaggerating! Where to goodness have you put that - Sorry, here it is! I've not worn it since our wedding. D'you remember how we said ... ... that when out daughters were safely married ... we'd leave them to reign here ... and go to the seaside ... and enjoy ourselves? And now I have to decide all alone ... whether this kingdom will fall to ... Drahomír or Zpěvanka or Maruška. One of the three - but which one? I love them all equally well ... but each is cast in a different mould. There's Drahomír ... When they showed her to me the first time, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. As ugly an infant as you could set eyes upon! But far and near you'll not find a fairer - more graceful or vainer creature. How often she made us laugh dolling herself up - And then I had to lift her - to let her see herself in the mirror! And it suits her even today. A queen all right - but more for the eye! Our second-born Zpěvanka - must have come from a fairy-land - of laughter and song and dance. Only I don't know how she would reign in this sad and sober world. Our people you'd maybe think her ... ... too vocal. Here he is again, and again and again ... Don't pipe, piper. Can't you hear? Can't you speak? You're crazy! He's crazy. Crazy all right - but about you! Can a Queen have a piper for her swain? Yes, but a singer can never be a Queen and reign. A larel wreath suits the royal head better, than a golden tingaling-ling-ling! You lie in your songster's throat, sister ... I shall be Queen! We'll see about that! Only you've forgotten, tralala! There's still Maruška, ha, ha, ha! A fine Queen she'd make! I wonder what she's got on this time. Sister! - Maruška! Maruška! Boys, haven't you seen Maruška? Oh, here you are, princess Maruška! The King wishes to decide - which of you will be Queen. Take off your apron and dress in your best. An apron suits me much better then a crown. You never can tell. Maybe it would, if you speak so wisely. Where have you come from, Old Woman? I sell sweet spices. Vanilla ... nutmeg and cinnamon, whatever you like. I have everything. Saffron, pepper, sweet marjoram and mustard. All these we'll buy from you, Grannie. Cook, bring the scales. And no salt? - Only spices. But salt is more precious than any spice! I said the royal crown would suit you well. It will be Maruška. She's the wisest and Ioves me - like you used to love me. Thank you, Mařenka. Let the Princesses enter and the band play! Where's Maruška? She'll be here in a moment. The one I was counting on most doesn't even bother. She was seeing to things in the kitchen. The kitchen's everything and I'm nothing. When they lay me under the sod not a soul will care a jot. I'm going to beg now, I'm an old man. My own daughters will drive me out. But daddy! Silence! Silence! One's as bad as the other or the third one. Don't hurry. Take your time. It's only your father waiting for you. Hear! When the Fates spin my life's thread to an end ... ... and my throne stands empty ... When my daughters lay aside the veil of mourning, skirmishes and squabbles for the Crown may threaten the unity of the land. But be not downhearted, my subjects! You King and Sovereign has found a solution. Today I shall designate as Queen the daughter who loves me, her King and Father best. This is my will! Come forward, Drahomír ... and tell me how much you love me. I love you - like gold. Gold - a rare element! Why not? Very good, Drahomír. And you, Zpěvanka, how much do you love me? Daddy, Your Majesty ... I love you like gold, too. Now wait, we've had that! Like the gold in my throat - this gold! A pity you Mother isn't here what a joy it would have been for her. I see and hear that you love me truly. Now only Maruška is left. Say, how much do you love me? I love you like ... I love you ... like only a daughter can love her father. But that's only your duty, isn't it? Anybody can come up with that! Take an example from your sisters. Now once more: You live me like - what? I'll help you. Besides gold there are other rare things ... I love you like salt! Like what? - Like salt. Salt. Salt? Yes, salt, because we can't do without it. That's something everybody has enough of. D'you mean to say that you've had enough of me? Daddy ... My own child is tired of me! My own blood and she's had enough of me! Thank God your Mother didn't live to see this day! Daddy, you don't know what I meant. You don't know, but you know everything. Teaching her grandmother to suck eggs! Daddy, do be reasonable! And saucy you are, too! Sa I'm not reasonable. Isn't it too funny? No! It's quite the contrary! So I'm funny an I? Make you laugh? Go from my house, unhappy one! Out you go! Out! Go home, doggie! Your Majesty, where are you? I am here! I've been looking for you every where! They're here! - Who? Came a different way! Who? - The Princes! Princes? That's a nice kettle of fish! How many? - Three. Three! And Princesses? Two. - Two. And one throne. That's six altogether. Altogether - how's that? Three, two and one are six! - Yes six. No! Only one throne but Princesses ... ... two. At the moment two. But Maruška is sure ... Maruška, poor thing, you drove her out. I beg your pardon? - Of course you did. Actually I did. But she'll come back, I know ... she can't be without me. She'll regret it! I know her! By nightfall she'll be here. By nightfall there'll be seven. What are you saying, seven? Well, yes. - Yes. Three Princes and one throne. Leave the throne out of it! - I can't. It's the throne that counts. You don't have to! No, you're mixing me up counting pears and apples together. Than what counts? That three Princes are not three Princesses ... but only two. - Yes, I mean - no. Stop that maths exercise! Stop mixing me up, when I've got to decide. Yes, but the Princes are waiting. I don't want to see them ... not now. Tell them to rest and change for dinner. Then it will be dark and Maruška will be here. And now hop it! Hop it! Hop what? Skedaddle! I see. Skedaddle. Very witty! So I'm skedaddling, skedaddling ske ... What am I to say to them? Sing to them, if you like, but keep them back. In the King's name, I welcome you ... I, And-so-on, that's me, And-so-on. I, myself, the King's other self, I, myself, the King's other self, And-so-on. I change my function at his injunction, From Groom-in-Waiting to Chief Physicians Scribe, barber, Lord High Chamberlain, As Companion to the Crown, I drink with him from night to morn, I weep with him and sing with him, I weep with him and sing with him, I, And-so-on, from night to morn, I'm sitting with him by a jug. We have consultations and disputations, If he hits me, then he apologizes, The long and the short of it is, I am His Majesty's ... The long and the short of it is, I am His Majesty's ... Chief Counsellor, And-so-on, And-so-on, And-so-on, And-so-on, And so on, my great prestige. And so on, And so on my name. I cannot introduce myself so finely, but ... Not necessary! I know who you are. You are the Handsome Prince, son of ... King Alabaster the Sixteenth. Right. You are the Brave Prince, son of ... King Děloslav the Eighth. Right. And you are the Wise Prince ... Son of my Father. I see. I shall accompany you to your chambers, you must be tired after your journey. What are you spying for here, Gardener? I'm taking care of you. You never could climb trees. But now I'm big. And as awkward as ever! Take care of Drahomír. Why do you call it that? Because it's well-grown, like you, has a sweet perfume, like you ... But pricks. - Like you. Give it to me. Keep it. I've a prettier one, a golden one. Golden roses have no scent. But it is lovelier to look at. A rose without scent ... is like a beauty without a heart. Our bogs are not for you, Princess. Put me down. As you wish. - Ouch. You won't get far not knowing the area! Where are you making for? - There! To the wood there? But it's a deep wood. - So what! Aren't you afraid? - No. Why are you so short with me? I'm sad, and no more questions. We're on dry land again. Good bye, fisherman! Stay! It will soon be dark ... and my hut is near. Not now. One day I shall return. Good bye, fisherman. Come away in, lassie. Come in, there's nobody here. Don't be afraid! You must be hungry. Make some garlic soup. The firewood's dry ... if you know how to light it. I see you do, Maruška. Sit down now, the soup will be ready in a little. It's not going to be this easy every day! Only today, because you've done so much running about. Sit down. Lovely smell! I must taste it. Good evening. Oh, it's you, Grannie? Yes, before I get all the little ones to sleep. The shoemaker's Anička, won't fall asleep! You were a little afraid, weren't you? Yes, but not unpleasantly. How do you do it? Who knows everything has nothing to learn. Besides it was an exception today. What would we have hands for? I'll do it myself. You cut the bread. So salt is more precious than gold? Isn't it true? Before we discover, we'll have our supper. Your majesty, enjoy your royal meal! Eels, oysters... What are you saying? Is it dark outside? Pitch dark! I wouldn't say so! - Well, not dark, but there's nothing to be seen. Tell me, Handsome Prince, is it dark outside? Darkness interests only the ugly - because it covers up their ugliness. Darkness is not my case. Wise Prince, what think you? Is it dark? It depends on what you mean by dark. It's not dark as pitch ... if it were, you could export it. Some monarchs pay a good price for pitch darkness. Well, is it dark or not? Command me and I shall make darkness. We'd better have our meal. Eels, oysters, lobsters, lampreys, salmon, trout, caviar. Wild duck and blackcock grilled with peach flavouring and basted with wine. Enough! A herring. A herring for everybody! Tasty, isn't it? Excellent, isn't it? Tasty - a real delicacy! And the lovely smell! And have you tried the head? Try the head - crisp as a lettuce! Well, do you like it? You don't like it? And why? You don't know? I'll tell you: Because it's salt. Yes, salt. Not even the dog wants it. A dumb creature - and knows how common salt is! What am I saying! Taste! Tasteless! Only my own blood, my own daughter. It's dark! So late and the girl's not home yet. Leaves her father's house just like that ... Maybe she's in the garden - hiding! What kind of inventions these are! Tinder box ..., useless! I'll show her up! I'll show up the whole kingdom! Maruška! Maruška! Maruška! Daddy! Grannie! Grannie! Grannie! You dreamt your Dad was calling you - and you wanted to go back, didn't you? I did, Grannie. Well, do as you like, if you think the time is ripe? The time is ripe? I miss him so. All because of the salt! And who was right? I was. But I long for him so - and he for me, too, I'm sure. - Maybe. Give him time and he'll find out that Truth can't be shouted down or driven out. Have patience - Truth's worth suffering for. If only he knew I was safe! It couldn't be managed, Grannie! You're in luck. Here are the two herbs I need. Smell this one and you'll be invisible. Smell again and you'll appear. Try it. You sniffed too little. Never do anything by halves! Not even miracles! Breathe in harder! What now, Grannie? Wish you were at the Castle and the other herb will take you there. I wished, bud I'm still here. I forgot to pick it - how stupid! Smell again. We'll go to the wood for it. I want to sleep, I want to sleep. I want to sleep! What do I want? To sleep I want. Sleep I what? Want! Who wants to sleep? Not me! I can't get to sleep. But you are asleep. Not at all! Maruška, do I wake or dream? Dreaming, of course. Could I do that except in a dream? So you're only a dream? You're a beautiful dream! I couldn't get to sleep for ages. They didn't make my bed properly! Nobody makes my bed like you. Mummy have me some hard drill in it! Oh yes, mummy! I'm sorry we never had a fleet. Your Mother was a born admiral. You'll never get to sleep like that! Amn't I sleeping? - Yes, but uneasily. I'm sleeping quite easily. See how easily I'm sleeping. I'm dreaming about my dearest daughter. But when I wake up, I'll be worried again. But in the morning I'll have new worries, what's up with you? Don't worry. I'm safe and you're my dearest Dad. And you are my pigheaded little girl, who has come back and Dad has forgiven her. Forgiven her what? - That nonsense about the salt. You've nothing to forgive me. If you're going to talk back, be gone! Say the word and I shall! No, no, wait a minute! So salt is still more precious than gold? And isn't it? - No. Everybody can get on without salt. - I'd like to see it! And we will se it! I'll destroy all the salt - to the last pinch! And how will you do it? You should know it, if you're so clever! Give orders for all salt to be brought here and we'll throw it into water. Now away to beddibyes! Dreams don't sleep, and I'm your dream. Yes, you are my dream. My dream is my dream ... and must obey like clockwork. And no trifling. I'm not dreaming - you are dreaming. No, you are dreaming - I'm not dreaming. Who's dreaming? What are you pushing yourself into my dream for? I only wanted to ask who you're abusing. Who ... Whom ... Why ... are you complaining? Why do you wish me to dream about you, when I'm dreaming about Maruška? She was here and is gone - all your fault! Maruška! Where is she? Where is she? Maruška! Where are you, Maruška? Maruška! She's gone. She's gone. Maruška! Maruška! But if she's gone, which one are you gone on? Which one am I gone on? Of course Maruška's the one I'm gone on! Who's doing that? What's wrong with you? Do you feel sick? Oh no, somebody's tickling me! Somebody's tickling me. Out, you clown! I'm a clown? - You're a clown. Quarrelling with a chair, your cap rising on your head, my candle snuffed out, Somebody tickling me, and I'm a clown. I'm offended. I'm leaving! And I can't even ask who'll be Queen? Not the Pigheaded one! Let the Princes themselves decide. And come and put out my candle. Well, what's up with you? Hear me? Well, are you coming? - I'm coming! And out you go! The stupidest dream I've ever had! I'll wake up out of it. I want to wake up, I want to wake up! I want to wake up, I want to wake up! What do I want? To wake up. Good night, Daddy. - Good night. A lovely day, isn't it? - Perfect. And how have we slept? - Too soft a couch. I prefer a battlefield. And the din of battle doesn't disturb you? After the battle, the victorious battle! From my room I see three lovely apple-trees above a crystal-clear well. Well. A' propos, cook! Is the water in the well living or dead? I don't know. I don't drink water. Living water is excellent for the complexion. I'm just thinking... Cook! Do these apple-trees bear golden fruit? I'd like to graft golden apples on out trees at home. Even if they bore little, it would be without work. Do you like to work? I mustn't. Work makes people ugly. I'm spoiling for a fight. Hey, idler, listen! Isn't there some gloomy ravine nearby where wild dragons have their lair? Dragons? Wild rabbits maybe! Dragons, that's my line. Six heads at a stroke! Have you some hot water? Yes, but the kitchen is still closed. Where the devil are you? If you excuse me... Quick to the wooing! The Princesses are in the garden, by chance - and you - by chance - are to meet them. Address them, caress them, woo them - and the one you like best is yours! And what about this? So. You can eat your fill at the wedding feast. And now we are free of that! Isn't it too little for two? We're not going to give them everything. Princes! Drones! Shall we go? ... and having cut through the hedge - he entered the Castle where all was asleep - the Sleeping Beauty, too, of course. And the Handsome Prince kissed her ... and the Princess woke up. We know that one. You know that, but you don't know who the handsome Prince was! It was me! And have you heard of Snow White? The one who served the dwarfs. How she slept in a glass coffin and a Prince came and kissed her. That was you, too! Yes - so you know that? - And then they got married. And the same with the Sleeping Beauty. The way it always ends after all ... They got married and lived happily ever after. That's only in the fairy-tale. I didn't marry her. I never wanted to get married - till I met you! Love has put my heart in a turmoil. Listen! Do you hear it beating? What are you doing here? Learning to shoot. Why? If a bear came, I'd shoot it. What would a bear be doing here? Seeking honey. But we haven't any bees. They might swarm here. Have you seen the swarm? No, I haven't. Well, go and look for it! Right. Fools must be fooled! Don't I know it! Fooling fools is my business! It's like the Prince who rescued the Princess from the clutches of a twenty-headed dragon. - It was you, wasn't it? Not likely. It was a fool. I knew the Princess: she wasn't worth it. But if it had been you - touch wood - the dragon might have had forty or hundred heads! Save himself who can, run for it! I've missed it! - Whom? Save himself who can, run for it! Save us! - Save us! Yes, of course. Just wait till I get my mail. What a surprise! Well I never, it isn't a bear after all! Something worse - a piper! You might be ashamed spoiling our chances! D'you want us to be old maids? And you want to marry such popinjays? What did I say to her then? - If I only knew! Wait, wait, it... Once again! She made the bed and said she was safe. Don't begin again, or it will take you like that night! The bath will help you. We quarrelled about salt, and I said, if only I knew, what I said to her! You told me I was a clown - but I've forgiven you for that. You'd nothing to forgive me. That's it! She said I'd nothing to forgive her. It's getting cold! But I wanted to show that I was right, but how - that's what I can't remember. But you will remember, you will remember, you will! A wonderful bath! Most refreshing! What's that? - Bath salts. I'll dissolve them in water ... Dissolve them in water! That's what I said and that's what I'll do! I know you will do that! Salt! Bring all the salt to me! To the Castle! Salt! I command all my subjects, without delay, to hand over their last grain of salt. All salt! Not a grain less, not a grain less, to the Castle! By order of King We the First! Next, please! Next, please! Next, please! Next, please! That's all? - No, but I'm not giving any more. You dare to oppose the King's command? Command? It's madness! Shut your gab, woman! Not before you and your King hear something. He knows why he keeps out of sight. He's ashamed - that's it. He was always a bit daft, but we said - no matter if he has a good heart. But yesterday he drove out Maruška - and today he's taking our salt. Without any real reason! Salt! Not even the cattle can do without it - woodland animals will go miles for it. If the wiseacre does not know it, let him ask my little Majdalenka, she will tell him! What shall we salt with, you botcher? Me? Botcher? You brazen tongue. I'll throw you into prison. Me? - You ... Hell's bells, that's a woman for you! She's right, too. What will folk salt with? With nothing. And so shall you. It won't be fit to eat. - Flummery, mummery! Next, please! What's up? You couldn't come along with the rest? Who are you? - The Herb Woman. The Herb Woman. Are you at home here? Yes, I'm at home everywhere. Yes, I'm at home everywhere. Yes, I'm at home everywhere. I'll pour it ... out for you. A nice old Grannie - I seem to know you. But that's quite a long time ago... Tell you what, keep your salt. If the King should need it, he can always have it. Where have I seen that old woman before? Everything completed! Everything done! It's not. But all the salt... I'm not done with it yet. Every grain of that worthless mineral throw into water and drown like a kitten! lmmediately! Maruška! Maruška! Moon, tell me, where is Maruška? When the water breathes deep from the bottom, and a tree trails its branch in the foam, while a dragonfly restlessly flitting turns a stalk into an emerald stone. No, my song has not enough passion, but each other's eyes we shall plumb, In the silence I hear your heart beating and you hear mine beat like a drum. That's the end of the song? No. One more verse about the deepest silence. Sing it then. Only two can sing that. - I know the melody. Teach me the words. It has neither melody nor words. How is it sung then? Like this. Maruška! Maruška! Maruška, where are you? Maruška! She'll come back to you. You're the kindest Grannie! I was afraid you'd be angry with me. Why? I know your fisherman, a good lad. But now take a good look! To prove that I am right ... - You always are! I've ordered a banquet undefiled pork banquet, by a grain of salt - without which food is said to be unpalatable. Well, I'm ceremonially opening the first salt-free pork feast ever. Bon appetit! Music! Eat your fill and drink with a will! I don't know about you, but I've enjoyed it. So have we. Still, it might have been better. Not without salt it can't. Oh, yes. We have a variety of tastes. What's sweet mustn't be salt. Tomorrow prepare a sweet feast. Enough! Pardon? Enough! What's the idea? - We have a variety of tastes. What's sour mustn't be salt. How dare you talking to me like that? - Give me salt and your appetite will come back. - Salt, salt! To cook with salt is no art ... ... but without it! Can't be done. - It can. No, it can't. - I'll prove it can. I'll do the cooking. And I'll look on. - You won't, because I'll throw you into prison. You made the prison into wine-cellar. We'll shut him up there. Looks like a barrel anyhow. Pan..., pancake..., pancakes ... Here it is! Pleasing to the palate of king and cottar are golden pancakes light as a feather. - Well, that's it. So, read it! Prepare a dough of yeast, eggs, sugar, flour, warm milk, lemon peel and ... Read it! Lemon peel and ... And what? - And salt! I told you salt was needed! - You half-baked doughnut! We'll put spices instead. Give it to me, we'll start immediately! Break one or two eggs ... What are you doing? One OR two eggs. One OR two eggs - that's three eggs. That's true. So, peck one egg open. They must be hard-boiled. No, they're not! We must try a different method ... Pass one or two eggs. - I'll take three at once. Put them into the mortar and let's get on with it! What about the shells? All eggs have shells to keep them together. At least the pancakes will be nice and crunchy. Add fragments of glass to it instead! Punish him! Bunglers! There's not much of it. - There's not! What size of pancakes had you in mind? For the whole Castle ... ... about half an acre. That's a tall order! That first? Flour! Remarkable how heavy it is. If one tackles something with enthusiasm - it must succeed! - It must! Just look, my lad! - Now he isn't looking when he might learn something. He's sitting there green with envy. Let him suffer there! Leave the shadows that delude you in the skies. And take what mother's care affords here! It will be fine and crunchy! And now milk. - Is it warm? Of course. Did you throw in some yeast? - What? Did you throw in some yeast? Good gracious, I forgot! - Throw it in there, and I'll throw it in here. Adequately! Adequately, adequately, adequately, adequately! That's it. And now? ... and now salt. - Not salt - spices! For half an acre. - Right! Caraway seeds? - How much? According to taste. - Adequately! Bay-leaf. Why not? Saffron, to give it colour. Adequately, adequately ... Cayenne to give it pep. Mustard to give it sharpness. And nutmeg to taste! What about camomile? - Shove some in. And sweet marjoram. Thyme, too. - And ginger! What's the box for? For good measure. What's that? I don't know. Oh, that there? It's rising. Isn't it rising too much? - No proportionately. Look! What's it doing? Do something! Add it there! - Close the door! Close the door, open the door ... It's going out. Blow on it, blow on it ... - What should I do? Into the arms the sweet song of woods, Into the arms the sweet, sweet flavour We'll rise here to death! Help! - Help! Help! - What's happened? I order you to come and help at once! Me too! - No ordering. Beg me to help you. - How dare you ... Wait, you have to beg! Beg! All right - I beg you! - Too little. You must entreat me. All right - I entreat you. - That's right! That's a different story! Here you are. - Well, give it to me and pull! Follow me, follow me! Follow me and don't fear, don't fear! What are we going to do now? - Keep the door shut and keep it out! Oh, look, I don't want to panic, but we are lost! We're not lost! We'll stuff it and hold it! And you, hold me, and push! In the hardest moments only the Ruler himself always knows what to do! One shouldn't grow old before one grows wise. Somebody else thought that one out. - But it fits the case. Your case, because now I know what I didn't before. See if I know, too. That for special work there must be specialists. No, I didn't know that. Then they might have been quite special ... Pancakes. And will be again. No, they won't. - You will laugh. And they will be! No, they won't and I'm tired and a bit ashamed. And I feel sad... and I feel like crying. I'll act the clown and make you laugh. An elephant stood in the river Nile with his trunk under water ... a crocodile came and seized his trunk. D'you know what the elephant said? That's a feeble kind of joke. Hem, how much I laughed, man! I'll be a cock. I'll be a bigger cock. I'm glad you think that funny. You'll think so, too! Come, quick! Take the gold. Why are we doing this? We'll see whether salt's more precious than gold! She has salt. Who? The buxom little widow that smacked you. We'll give her all the gold and jewels ... and she'll give use her salt! I'll salt my bread. ... and I'll prove myself right. Load it there! Well, here she lives. Go and speak to her. I did once. You try this time. Me? - Yes, knock on the door. That's easy, that's easy! You must give three proper banks. What's the row? Oh, what guests! What are you looking for here? I..., I..., I'm not, I'm not looking for, but... I've something very useful for you - namely, a real, royal, hall-marked treasure. Such a treasure always pays in a household. You sleep on a straw mattress? For a little ring like this you can get three cartloads of eiderdown. Do you go dancing? Put on these emerald earrings - and your neighbours will turn green! If you don't like your cottage - sell a ruby and buy a farm. You can have the lot - lock, stock and barrel ... What for? For a bag of salt. - For a bag of salt? Then I'll salt my bread with diamonds? Or with earrings? Or I'll give the sheep emeralds to lick? Bugbear! Bugbear! A bugbear in his head. He might be ashamed to call himself King. You should be ashamed! An old crank with this salt business. What have you done with our salt? What? If you offered me your whole kingdom, I won't give you a grain! I'll keep it for good people! What's wrong sister? I feel faint. That's with going hungry. Better starve than eat without salt. Little sister, don't fall! Oooh, what to do? Help us, help us, help us! Help us, help us, help us! Thank you, gardener. I have a headache, my throat is contracting and my heart pains sharp. Feeling better? Not sorry to be without your jewels? I like to be liked. - I like you without them. Besides, I've better one. Help us, help us, help us! What's going on? Why are you calling for help? How come you can talk? - My Mother taught me. And why didn't you talk before? - Was there any good talking to you? Good or no good, now you must help. She needs none. But now I'm feeling faint ... My ear. Now the nose! Can you hear it? All Princesses used to lie at my feet. Maybe, I'm getting old or something ... We're taking ourselves off, bag and baggage and Goodbye, Hungry Kingdom! Going, too? - Why should I stay, after all? Right, even courtiers are leaving. A dog's life! Don't you know where that land is - the one flowing with milk and honey? Perhaps across seven rivers. There's a short cut past the Gingerbread Cottage. Thank you. - They're going to lose their way there! They won't find anything ... I've searched every inch of this kingdom - but everywhere you've got to work. Where are you off to, gentlemen? Should we help? He doesn't mean them, he means us. Permit us to help you, it's too much for you! What is it? We are wandering in circles. We can't go on. - We must. All we must do ... is divide the booty here and now. That's right! If we've got to toil - then each with his own. I can't manage it myself. Help me to get this out of the wood - and I'll give you something for it. Isn't it share and share alike? Of course, share alike. We two, half and half. And what about me? - There isn't a third half. And so for you two there won't be anything. Slowly! That novelty will drill a hole in your mail. We'll drill a hole in you and everything's ours. I'll do the drilling and it'll be mine. How come? One shot makes a hole in only one. And another shot makes a hole in the other. That cannot be denied. Now we needn't waste time dividing it. Oh, the treasure is going! Look, what we failed to do today - we can do elsewhere tomorrow. But first we must get out of the wood. The wrong road! This leads past the gallows. The devil take the gold and the courtiers - I want just one thing, Maruška, the truth to dawn on me. Hang it all! If only I knew what to do at last, only if my eyes would open to see the truth, before it turns against me. That I've never looked for it? Haven't I installed a telescope - to see far and wide what everybody's doing? I look into their plates. But a telescope is probably not enough. But I suppose one should go into their homes and see, hear and understand. I shouldn't be afraid to go among people? I'm not. I'll go now - into the storm. Come on! - Wait till it stops raining. If it were to rain hail and brimstone I won't. - Where will you go? Where the bread is salted and there's a good king. The one who rules here is neither good nor a King A king that drives out his own daughter! Yesterday he took the people's salt, tomorrow he'll be shaving their heads. And it's joyless here. - And salt less! Come on, come on! We'll salt our radishes, have a beer ... - And salt rolls ... and salt herring! It's all right for them. But what about me? I've driven out my daughter, yesterday I took the people's salt - and tomorrow ... What am I saying?! Who will help me? I shall. But I need Maruška. Maruška! Maruška! You were calling me, Grannie? - What's that good smell? Fish soup. He's back and terribly hungry. Well, you'll be back in a moment. But now you must go to your Daddy. Aren't you glad? - I am. You'd rather make the soup, is that it? What's up? I hope that nobody's hurt you? I hurt my Daddy. I always thought I loved only Dad. And now there is room for the fisherman? That's not why you should be sad. A good heart has room for all people of good will. It's like with this salt-box. It contains as much salt as is love in your Dad's heart. Only for his own wants it's not enough. But if for all, it's bottomless. Maruška! Oh, I'm asleep again ... and you're my dream. Today your dream - tomorrow reality. Really genuine? Take care you don't upset the salt. You have salt? - No more? Isn't it enough? - It's the people I'm thinking of - for them it's too little. Perhaps it will do. Let's try it. It's a bottomless salt-box. There's a whole pint of salt in it! Not just a pint, there's a whole tub of salt in it! A whole heap of salt! A whole hill of salt! Alps of salt! Salt for the whole kingdom. Salt for the whole world! We'll salt our bread, all of us. What d'you say, grand isn't it this salt? It's all thanks to Maruška. I always said you could depend on her. And I was always good to her, wasn't I Maruška? Where is she? Maruška? Maruška! Maruška! I don't care about the salt, I want Maruška. Maruška! Maruška!... Hello, woman! Hello, woman! Can you hear? Haven't you seen my daughter? You want water? No. Haven't you seen my girl? You head's in a whirl? No, haven't you seen that girl of mine? A glass of wine? No! I have a daughter - young, beautiful, pigheaded ... I drove my daughter out - broken-hearted - me I'm seeking her everywhere. If you lost her, find her. So I shall. And it was your King you were speaking to! Laugh at human misfortune - you silly flowers! I'll show you who's master here. It's still King We the First! What's happened? I'm sinking into the bog. Help! I'll fossilize - turn into coal - heat a stove! Do something, folk, wise Mother Nature! Why are you crying here? Deaf woman, one day there will be a tablet: "Here perished a King" who ruled badly - fed the false, drove out the sincere - called himself King We the First - "and didn't know he was the last." I'm rising! Now I feel better! I'm rising! You've found firm ground under your feet. So I won't perish! Long may I live! Everything can still be put right! Run to the fisher's cottage. - To the fisher's cottage? For Maruška! - For Maruška! Daddy! I've got a chill - a whacking big one! The steam is choking me! But you make good hot grog! I taught her that. You be quiet. You're not one of the family yet. But you might have written a line to you Dad. Not because I'm a King. But father should know everything. Still you haven't made a bad choice. The Crown will suit him quite well. I prefer to keep to my pond. But if you like, make me Fish Warden. What is he talking? A Queen can't have a fish warden as consort. I don't wish to be Queen. Who's going to rule? You've made a mess of things - now you must put them right. You're in your prime. Do you think so? In this case I would manage one more cup. In my prime! If I might say what I think, then... Then what? - You should marry again. That's true. But where would I find ... A bride? She mustn't be one with a monogram and a crown. Of course she mustn't! She needn't! What should she have a monogram and a crown for? Wine for the Highest Chief Fish Warden! What? - Do you believe now that salt is more precious than gold? I do. And do you know what is more precious than salt? Everybody knows that - love, of course! And Love is the Salt of Life!
