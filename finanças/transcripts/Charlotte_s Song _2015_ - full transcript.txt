I am your grandmother. They're fairies. Oh, fairies, eh? Ohh. Let me tell you a story about a mermaid blinded by her foolish fantasy of her life on the land. The mermaid was stolen from the water forever by the very man whom she had saved from death. Now, unless she is returned to the sea, another must be found to take her place. For the balance between the worlds must be preserved, at all costs. Let's go. I'm suppose to be going to bed now. Go to your bed, take this with you, okay. It's happening George, we need to do something! Where is she now? I locked her in your office, what else could I do? She won't stay in there, she doesn't want to. She found us here, she'll find us anywhere. Maybe it's time we pay the debt. No, I will not hand my daughter over to that creature. No, you leave me alone. I just need time to think, I just...

Well if, if I had any I'd, I'd give it to you, it's just that this is all we got. Sorry friend, no cash, no gas. Can't we at least give them a bit? You wanna end up like those folks? Tim! Look at you, ain't you all grown up? I brought you a postcard. I remember you like them. What do you got there? Some gas for a family with no money. Mm, father doesn't know you're doin' this, does he? How's his mood? Foul. Figured as much. Maybe, I'll take this down the road for you, and I'll come back in a couple days. Can I come? That's a surefire way to stir the hornet's nest. I'll come back, I promise. Father, I just... I'm busy. I just thought you'd wanna know Tim was here. This won't even cover a quarter of a payment! Hello, Charlotte. There's a power growing inside of you, Charlotte. Soon you'll be faced with a very important decision. The mermaid chose to abandon her fish's tail. And so the balance between the worlds was upset and will never be healed until the daughter chooses to return to her people. On land, she can never be home, humanity is not her kind. Their world is hollow, misery will be her only companion. Father says I'm too old for stories.

It's in our best interests to help each other. Isn't that what folks do when times get rough? How exactly is this arrangement going to work? Harold here will be staying behind to watch over the collateral. For now, while I'm putting more money in than I'm getting out, I have the say. Once you've paid back my investment, and you're on your feet, I get a cut and you get the say. I don't know. You're not in a position to be picky. I don't need no charity either.

I thought maybe you might wanna stay in one place for awhile, maybe do some work for me. Jeez George, I don't... I got some investment now and I need some help runnin' things. What's that fella outside? Harold. Yes, part of the reason why I need my own guy. What, he your investor? No, that's a Joe by the name of Randall. You heard of him. Yeah, yeah, I heard of him. What's the matter? You need to get out of this deal, as soon as you can. I ain't asking for your advice. Trust me. He's helpin' this family, that's more than I can ever say about you. I worked for Randall when things first got bad. I'm stayin' away from this place for a reason. Ain't nothin' you ever done been honorable when it comes to me. George. Get outta my house.

Thank god you came, I have no one else to turn to. What is that for? What happened? Is it always like this? Not when you love him. Ah-ah-ah, Ned. Darling. Who's Ned? For all I know he could be lyin' dead in a ditch somewhere. You gotta take the girls, you gotta get outta here, that's all there is to it. I can't. Why not? Hey the only thing that's keepin' Charlotte safe right now is our distance from water. I'm between a rock and a hard place. I gotta clean up this mess before it spreads. Thinkin' maybe you could talk to Randall. No. - Tim, please. - I don't wanna get mixed back up with that lot! Do it for the girls, for Serena. I need time to think about this. Then go, think, just don't take too long, Randall's due to check in any time. Tim, I knew I could count on you. Yeah. Yeah. Do you know where Grandmother is? I wish you'd stop callin' her that. She's just some old hag that helped mother in California. Clean up your own mess. It's time for the child's return. No, I can't allow it. It's Charlotte's decision to make and sooner or later she will choose to return. You'll make sure of it. I forbid you from seeing her. So be it. She'll be thirsty. Did y'all come back to see me? Huh, course. You know you've always been the favorite out of all your sisters. Gosh, you're startin' to look just like your mother did when I first met her. Nobody likes to talk about her anymore. Yeah, what would you like to hear? How'd you meet her? Well, I knew your dad first. He was always the ladies man. And this one day, I heard him talking about this amazing woman he'd met. Which was strange 'cause your father never used to talk about the girls he'd go with. I thought maybe it'd last a week or so. Then I saw her for myself. Your mother was performing at this little nightclub right down on Venice Beach. Goddamn, if she wasn't the most beautiful woman I had ever saw, bar none. Anyway, we met through your dad. He and I were inseparable back in those days. What was California like? It was beautiful. The ocean stretches for miles and miles, as far as you can see. Would you ever go back? Hm, it's a nicer place than Oklahoma. Would you take me there too? No, I don't think your father'd be very pleased with that. I don't care. Well, that's easy for you to say. No. I'm sorry, I won't tell father. No, no, it's, it's not that. You won't have to pay like the other men. You forgot to mention that the only reason Charlotte attacked Harold is because he paid you to let him have his way with her! Randall made me do it, they were gonna kill me! Why do you think I called you? You have to stop this! I can't without your help! Goddammit! Fine, I'll speak to Randall. Just tell him I'm lookin' for Harold. Tell him I'm doin' my best. Thank you, Tim. Have you seen Grandmother anywhere? I've forbidden her from seeing you. You have no right. That woman wants to take you away from here, you understand? Why? It's complicated, she, your mother didn't want you to know. Grandmother talks to me about it. She's lyin' to you. Well at least she treats me like an adult. Charlotte, there are people, things in this world that wish to do you harm, I'm tryin' to protect you. Then why did you let him do that to me? And that other man, why did you let him touch Sophia? You could've stopped them. Why didn't you stop them? Just for a little while longer, I promise. You didn't even come to see if I was okay. You're not a normal girl, you're special. And all this business with Randall and your sisters and what they do, it's all for you. I don't want any of this to be happenin'. You don't have a choice! And so the balance between worlds was upset and will never be healed until the daughter chooses to return to her people. On land, she can never be home. Misery will be her only companion. What happened? Your father. You let him do this to you? Oh, I knew you would come. Do you remember the story of the stolen mermaid? That story was about your mother. Your father was the merchant sailor who tricked her into giving up her tail in exchange for this existence. The bargain made was that the daughter of a true love would replace the mermaid when the time was right. But your mother interrupted the arrangement. She killed herself to save me? Yes, but the imbalance remained. You're unique Charlotte, my dear. Not fully human, and not fully of my kind either. You have a choice. Emily says you're not my real grandmother. I'm more family to you than she will ever be. Why didn't you tell me sooner? Oh, you needed to be ready. You're a commodity to them. The only one who loved you was your mother. Because you're the same. I can show you how to control your powers. But not here. So far away from my home, I'm weak. It's time to go home, Charlotte. Charlotte? Charlotte! What lies have you been feeding her? Go back to where you came from. You dare. Yah! There you are. ♪ Just a lap, a little slap ♪ ♪ And we'll be miles away ♪ 'Member when you used to sing that? Would you sing it again? ♪ Oh but if my prayers are dashed upon the shores ♪ ♪ I'll be forever yours my darling ♪ For a moment I coulda swore I saw mother. I know. Well you must be gettin' tired. You have to go. No. You have to go. Go on. I, I know a way you and Ned can leave here. Meet me in the showroom at dawn. We have to leave right now! We can't leave without Charlotte. Hey! Oh god no, please! No, please no. Please help her. You took her life. Get outta here. No! Get back inside. Go! She brought this on herself. You hear me? Oh, be thankful. Wake up, please. Father. Leave us be, girls. Come now. This is a family joint. No need for any back room deals, eh George? I must apologize, I would've come sooner but I wanted to see what you were going to do about Harold. Your approach really was quite innovative. Not many men are brave enough to try and ignore a problem and just hope it goes away, especially when it comes to problems that involve me. I, I don't know what you're talkin' about. Harold ran outta here like a mad man last time we saw him. I'll, I'll make it up to you. Oh, you think Harold's dead, don't you? He's quite alive. Missing half his face and won't stop raving about the monsters of course but alive nonetheless. It was an accident, we tried to find him. I, I didn't even know where to start. I understand. You did your best, that's all I can ask. I want to thank you for trying to find my man. I ain't gonna bite you. Come on in, boys. What are you gonna do? Won't take a minute, dear. No, no. Now, now, this is no way to behave. Put up a brave face for your daughters, at least. I'll do anything. No, no. Don't do it, it wasn't his fault. Well I guess all the guts went to the women in your family. Take hers. Take her finger instead. Oh, well I'm not easily surprised but this, whatever you say, George.

I didn't think it was gonna work but you pulled it off. Your mother would've been proud of you. Sophia, hi, we've come to offer our congratulations to Charlotte. Oh, she's just freshening up. Thanks. Charlotte, someone's here to see you. Thanks. Tim! Oh, hello. This is Sylvia. Wonderful show. Now, be a dear for me and wait for me in the car. That a, finally what it was when your mother performed it in California. Goodbye Charlotte, we're movin' on. Goodbye. You got a lot of nerve comin' in here after what you did. Excuse me. Randall nearly cut my finger off after your little chat with him. He said you already told him about Harold and everything was square with you two. Seems like one of us is lyin' then. Besides, I thought the whole idea was to stay away from Randall. Not put Charlotte in the goddamn show. Who are you to judge me? You know this is exactly what he wants. This is exactly what I was tryin' to tell you. You're blamin' me for this? You know what, you don't have to worry about me anymore. I just came to say goodbye to the girls. I'm glad you cleaned up the place, but I'm leavin'. What do you mean? I stuck my neck out for you, and now I'm right back to where I started. Randall barkin' orders at me, like I'm his right hand man. So long, George. Tim! Wait. Before you go, can I show you somethin'? I should be goin'. Please, it'll only take a moment. Oh, I'll be right back. Come on. It's a full house, girls, full. There's still people waitin' outside. You're doin' a more outstandin' job than even your mother.

Where are you headed? I only want to talk. You're one of them. Them, I'm one of us. Be careful. You have to utilize all the assets at your disposal. Harold here will be staying behind to watch over the calamity. You know how these deals work. My trick can make you money. You suppose this will solve your problem? It was all you, you made me. I'm your only chance to escape the sheer boredom of existence. You know we're different from the humans. Higher in every way. It's not so glorious anymore, is it? You thought they were cheering for you this whole time. They are cheering for me. They cheer for what you can do to them. They're like dogs compared to us. And like dogs, we can train them to do all kinds of tricks. So this is what our kind does for fun? That's just what I do for fun, for now at least. You can choose to do whatever you want. I'm going far away from this place, and never singing again. You can try. Your father's paid back his debt, by the way. Where is she? Who? You know damn well who. Father! Look what I found. I distinctly remember asking you if you'd seen Tim, quite recently. I, I swear I haven't seen Tim in ages. Then he's lying. So you, you don't mind if I punish him accordingly? Where's the star of your show? I gave her the night off. I hope you haven't lost your gift horse. I'm right here. Good, thought you might have left town on me. Pay attention. I have a bone to pick with your father. It has come to my attention that you have been providing certain services without cutting me in. I don't know what you're talkin' about. Booze and women are my game, George. I've been payin' you your cut for all the booze... But not the women. What? He's been running the whore house right under your nose. Maybe you were too caught up in your own celebrity to notice. You said you would stop. Why would he? It's pure profit when you cut out your investors. Is this true? Oh course not, he's lyin'. It is true. He didn't make me do it, 'cause he knew I'd tell. But they have. Your wife, Gertrude, you'd think you'd have learned your lesson about my kind by now. Oh, I'm sorry, George, I thought you knew. Oh let's get. That's the other thing, we have a disgruntled customer. Seems Harold paid for service he didn't receive. Please. Don't, I'll give you the whole operation if you want. I'm starting to think that you would say anything to get out of trouble. I like you, I like your family. But Harold thinks we've taken the maximum amount of disrespect from you that our organization can handle. Word's getting out that I've got a soft spot for the guy with all the girls. I can't have that. Take the girls, kill George. - ♪ It's only for a day ♪ - No! No, no, no! No, no! No, you stop that! No! No, no!
