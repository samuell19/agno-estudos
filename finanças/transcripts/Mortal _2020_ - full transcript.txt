Don't touch me! You're telling me what to do? -Who do you think you are? -Ole! Hey, hey, I asked you a question. Ole! Get up! If you touch me, you will burn. Eric, my name is Christine Aas, I'm a psychologist, I... I don't work for the police,... ...but they've asked me to come here and talk to you. Would you like to come here and sit... Eric? Will you come and sit with me, please? My English is only so-so. Sorry. I've never been to America, so... You descend from Norwegians? Many generations back, it seems. How did you find your family here? Online or...? Eric? A lot of people are wondering what happened last night... ...with you and the boy. I... I don't think you did anything wrong. I think something happened that... ...nobody quite understands yet. But maybe you do? I think that sometimes... ...bad things happen to good people. Awful things. It's not their fault. I think people are, in their hearts, genuinely good. I tried... I did. I told him that... But he didn't listen to me. He didn't listen to me, you know. I'm listening. Tell me. I tried to tell him. It's my fault. I tried to tell him not to touch me. And then he... They were all your relatives, right? The people at the farm? Did everyone die? Except you. I was sure you knew. I'm so sorry. Eric. What happened at the farm in Ardal? You know I killed them. And I killed the man too. I don't understand how you could have. That's impossible. How do you do that? I don't know. They were found burned. This... This doesn't prove... -Eric! -Do you believe me now? What are you doing? Eric, stop this! -Stop it now. -I can't. It's your emotions! Turn it off! Turn it off! Eric, it's your emotions! You're setting this off! If you focus away from your fears,... ...you can learn how to control it! It's coming from inside you, so it's all up to you! Isolate yourself from everything around you! You control it! Just breathe! I know you can stop this! Eric, this is Cora Hathaway from the U.S. Embassy. She's here to help you get back to America. Eric, you have to talk to them now. No, I just want to talk to you, nobody else. Christine. Which is why we need to sedate you, Eric. I'll do it myself. Eric? He's burning up. The sedation is wearing off. Eric? Eric, relax. We're taking you to Oslo and then somewhere safe. You'll be well-taken care of, okay? We're gonna find out what's going on with you,... ...I promise. Eric? -Relax. -I've already given him... ...maximum dosage. Any more, and he could die. -Eric? -Get me out of here! Get me out of here! Eric? Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Lie down! Zero-Zero, emergency, all main engines switches to off. Override, Fox Two. Mayday, mayday, mayday! Helicopter Zero-Zero going down... Mayday, mayday, mayday! Zero-Zero, we're going down! Ditch, ditch, ditch! Spin out, spin out. 1,200 feet. Ditch! Ditch! Ditch! I will try to do this in English... ...since we have some foreign people with us today. As we have not yet contacted... ...the relatives of the crash victims,... ...I can only say that we have uncovered... ...three dead bodies in the helicopter. One American woman is in hospital... ...with smaller injuries. She's doing well all things considered. I also cannot tell you the status of the other American. But I'll keep you updated. Okay. Thank you. Christine! Eric? I... The helicopter crashed. Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere? I'm going to take you to my friend's cabin... ...and we'll figure it out, okay? I'll be right back. I don't want to hurt you. Eric? How did this happen to you? What is this? Whoa, I'll just do it, I don't want to zap you. Hey, how do I say thank you in Norwegian? Norwegian? Tusen takk. Tusen takk, Christine. Is there anyone you'd like to call back in the U.S.? When did it start? At the farm. I got there,... ...something just started building up inside of me. And then I just exploded,... ...and everything burst into flames. And... It is crucial that you understand how important it is... ...to the U.S. government that you get Bergland. You're lucky to be alive. -That was some crash. -Thank you. Two minutes before we took off. While we were in air moments before we crashed. You mean he had something to do with this? I saw it with my own eyes. He created all that. He made us crash. He saved your life. I'm not saying he's a bad person. I don't care what he is. We need to find him quickly and get him under control. Christine? Christine? Christine? -I didn't mean to... -It's fine. I was thinking a lot about the farm. -And I was thinking I should... -Yeah. What? We have to go to the police and you need to turn yourself in. I just can't do this, it's... I need to go home. I can give you a ride back down if you'd like. And we could go in together. -I'm sorry. -No, that's alright... ...I understand. -You snore a lot. -I snore? Sorry. Christine... Christine, I just want to tell you that I'm... I'm... I just had a thought that I wanted it not to rain on you. Let's not go to the police. No. You've done enough for me. I think you should go home. I don't want to. We should go to the farm. What do you think will happen when we get to the farm? I don't know. While I was there, it felt like there was something... ...calling me. It was calling me towards something. I love ferries. It's like taking a break from the world for a few minutes. Eric? Are you okay? They know that I'm with you, so we need to leave. Now! What were you doing? You can't just leave like that. Christine, the gas station, the houses and the roads,... ...everything just disappears. One minute it's all there,... ...and then the next it's just all fields. And the sky just becomes a different color. Sometimes I just get pulled into these... ...these visions, and I see things. I can't really explain it, I just see them,... ...it happened since the farm. I can walk around, I can touch things,... I can feel things, I feel the wind, the heat. It's freezing, it felt like I was freezing. And these are places you've been? No, they're not places I've been. Some of these places don't even seem possible,... ...like they're different worlds. And in the background the sky's filled... ...with this enormous shape that looks like a... -Like what? -Like... I know it sounds strange, but it looks like a tree. Like this enormous, beautiful tree... ...that fills the entire horizon. When you were sleeping in the cabin,... ...I just kept thinking about everything and... Like, will it stay with you for the rest of your life? Where does it come from? -Are you the next Jesus? -Jesus didn't make people die. You can do things with the atmosphere... ...and air and water. Who knows what else you can do? Or what you can achieve if... ...if you learn how to control it. Just let me talk to him. -Are you crazy? -I... It's my boyfriend, he's very sick. We need to get him to a hospital. Just, please, help us. Are you sure he's okay? Yes. He's... He's fine. If they cross that bridge, we lose them. If we lose them, they'll be in Bergen in no time. We can't have a situation in the tunnels... ...before the bridge, that's too dangerous. They cannot reach a city, you do agree with me, right? Just stop them before they get to that bridge. Please. What's going on here? Is this for you? Don't shoot, don't shoot! Get out of the vehicle with your hands in the air! This is your last warning! Get out with your hands in the air! I wish things were different. Hands up! Over your head! Get down! Hands in the air! Don't move! Get down on the ground! -Don't! No! Don't touch her! -Get down! Take your hands off her! Tell him to take his hands off her! -Show me your hands! -Take your hands off her! -Get down, or I'll have to shoot! -Take your hands off her! Eric? Can you hear me? Stay down! Stay down! Eric, listen to me! You have to stop this! Eric? You have to focus on what you can do and how you can control it. Get down, don't get up! You need to do what you did at the police station... ...to make it all stop. -On the ground! -Keep all the noise out! Stay down! Stop! Get down! Stay down! With all due respect, I disagree. You haven't seen what I've seen. Imagine in a few days when people realize what he represents... ...or what he doesn't represent. Imagine Christians, Muslims, everyone who believes in God. Suddenly a God-like human proves they're all wrong. He doesn't represent any of them. What happens then? I think that's the only thing we can do. I'll make sure it happens. Are they calling me Thor? You can't blame them, can you? Eric? Can you hear me? Eric? -Christine? Where am I? -We lost you. We lost you but the doctors got your heart going again. They need to do an MR scan. No, please, will you just let me out of here? No, we need to see what's going on inside you. I'm right here, Eric, right outside. Just talk to me. I was there again. This time everything was frozen, like an Ice Age. It still had the same tree, though. Okay, Eric, try to relax, we'll just turn the machine on. Now we're scanning, there will be some noises. Just relax. -Eric? -Please! Hold on, hold on! Eric, are you okay? What did she say? You're a monster! You killed my only son. I'm sorry. I really am sorry. I didn't mean to hurt him. There is somebody else's kid about to die... ...and you need to let me go help them now. Thank you. Can I try something, please? No, no. Please. Thor is Norwegian! Eric... Touch me! Touch me, Eric! What do you think they expect from me? What? Are you all right? After Thor and all the other gods died at Ragnarok,... ...his two sons built a farm on the ruins of Asgard... ...to restart their lives... ...and rescue all the knowledge the gods possessed... ...to prepare for their return. This place we're going to,... ...what if that is the farm Thor's sons built? What if that's the reason you're connected to it? What if you are his descendant? Can I just have a minute, please? Why don't the two of us go up and have a look first? Do you remember anything? I can't get up! I can't move! Ma'am? They're ready for you. Sierra 2 Charlie, we've got eyes on target. Awaiting orders, over. If anything happens that escalates the situation,... -...we're gonna fire on him. -Copy that. Like what? I'm not sure yet. It all happened so fast. The house just lit on fire... And I just watched those people die... It wasn't your fault. Eric? I think we've found a crypt or a cave. We will go down first. I don't want to risk another fire. Stay here, and I'll let you know if you should come. Okay? Target is isolated. Looks like they have found something... ...underneath the fire plot. It's your turn now. See what it is and then get out of there as quickly as you can. They're ready for you. Okay, Eric, follow the walkway to the back wall. There's a mural there with a big tree on it. A box is in front of that mural. The workers, they are equipped to open it. But please let them out of there before you do anything. What is this? I don't know. Let's find out. I think it's time for us to leave. The workers are coming back out. No visual on Bergland. We assume he's still down there. Christine? It's a hammer. The workers are saying Eric is now alone with the box. What's happening? Are you okay? The hammer is protecting me. Please come back up. He's holding a hammer. The object is a hammer. I can see something in his hand. Permission to fire. We have civilians coming to the site. What's the order? Are we firing or what? -Ma'am? -Fire. Female casualty. Christine, stay with me! Christine! No, no, no! No, no, no! This is absolutely devastating. The cult of Thor... With the terrorist Eric Bergland still at large...
