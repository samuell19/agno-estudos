This version was made with materials provided by the Experimental Film Center and the National film Cinematheque Get down! An Austrian patrol! Fire! An Austrian patrol. Only respond to fire when you can see them. When it explodes we'll withdraw. "Kamerad, kamerad"! - Stop! Stop the fire! - "Kamerad"! "Kamerad, kamerad..." It is an Italian uniform, of our division. And also of our regiment. I know him. Son of a bitch, you are a deserter! - You called us "kamerad". - I thought you were Austrian. It would have been convenient, the war would have been over for you... No, no. I got lost. Lieutenant, he's got a habit of getting lost, and it's not the first time it's happened. - You're unlucky coming across me, what's your name? - Giuseppe Marrasi. - How did you end up here? - We were patrolling, they fired upon. - Who shot at you? - The Austrians. - But it was us. - Lieutenant, we couldn't see anything! Idiot! MANY WARS AGO - Avellini! - Yes, sir. - To the observation post. - I must carry out a front line punishment, Major. - Proceed. This way. Lieutenant Sassu of 10th company. I have received orders to be at your disposal. Have a seat. - Want some? - No, thanks, I don't drink. Are you a teetotaler? Have you taken a sobriety oath? You've come from behind the lines? Yes, but I was at the front for 4 months in Trentino. Ah, that's why you don't drink, there's no fighting there. - Just patrolling. - That's why I asked to be sent here. Monte Fior, we are losing it... It'll be up to us soon. The division is retreating. Let's hope they arrive back here in time. There he is, General Leone. He's had to give up. The manuals say that: Those who control the mountain top have the key of the plateau. But if they don't send you the cannons, the key to the plateau is left hanging by the door. Luckily the Austrian headquarters are stupid idiots like ours. Now they're taking Mount Fior and then they won't send them any artillery. And the art of warfare follows its course... Stop! Lieutenant. Yes, sir! - Who gave the order to stop? - I believe a scout did, General. Have him shot. Yes, sir. There it is, the Italian line. Exposed for two miles. We'll make a dash for it. - Has he been shot yet? - No, sir. It's been confirmed that it was a scout that called for the stop. He came into the open... Austrian machine guns are above beating the ground. Shoot him anyway. General, I cannot shoot a man who hasn't done anything. Place him before the firing squad. Immediately! Yes, sir. Lieutenant, I called for the stop. What do we do now? Continue or stop? Come here. - A smoke? - Thanks. - How old are you? - 21. - What's your profession? - I'm a farmer, Lieutenant. - So, what do you say? - About what, Lieutenant? Stop! You guys with the corpse, wait. Wait. You there, fire into the air! Fire your arms! Let's go now! The order has been carried out, General. In war, discipline is painful but necessary. Let's honor our dead. Battalion, get ready! Forward, march! Quickly! Get a move on! - Lieutenant, don't leave me to die! - Help me release the others! Fire. Fire. We have left Mount Fior, only because we were ordered to. 3.000 dead. However, now the order is to retake it. - At any cost! - 5.000 dead. We will attack immediately... So that the enemy cannot strengthen its positions, or dig trenches. This time we will not attack the mountain directly. We will attack it from the sides, in order to isolate... the enemy units that conquered it. March! Leave me alone! - Enough! What have I done? - You should have done nothing. Like the rest of us. I should have let him fall into the ravine? Sure! When we will get another chance like this? What's going on? Let's move! What are you doing? Stand up, move on. Let's move! Let's march! Come on! Stop! General, the trumpet blowers are here. Get it into your heads, soldiers, it's worse to live here than to die... That's something you should know. This new line will be our grave or our honor. And you, the enemy, listen to me: "This line will be our grave or our honor." Lieutenant Santini. - Is this your sector? - Yes, sir. You go first then. General... Be quiet... Where is your bayonet? No, give it to me. What is this? A little rust, General. Come here, have a look. What is written here? I can't read, General. General, I can't see anything. There's a word written here... that everyone can read, even the illiterates... that everyone can see, even the blind... It's so bright. Don't you think so, Lieutenant? - To be honest I don't know... - Victory! Victory! It is written on this blade! We fight for victory and it is for victory that we must retake Mount Fior. - You can go. - Yes, sir. Continue working. He's coming. Attention! Lieutenant Ottolenghi. Do all your soldiers have a knife? - A knife? - Yes, a knife. Some have, some don't. The bayonet is not enough... In close combat, especially at night, a knife is needed. A knife with a long and sharp blade. You do understand me, right? Yes, General. How many knives do you have? 150. With a fastened handle? Not all of them. Do you check them regularly? - No, General. - That's not good. - From now on you must do so. Yes, sir. For what purposes do your men use a knife? It depends... To cut meat, bread or cheese... - ...and to peel oranges, General. - I mean for use in combat! For use in combat, yes. Be sure that a gun with a bayonet must be grasped with the two hands. And for that reason, the knife must be kept between the teeth. And the blow must be sudden: To the heart or the throat, it doesn't matter... but it has to be sudden. - Stay here. - As you wish. Let's work. Let's take shelter. What is the distance between our trenches and the Austrians? Around 250 meters. - So from here it's 230 meters. - That's likely. That's not at all likely. It is certain. General, it's dangerous to expose yourself like that. The Austrians have good snipers. Corporal. If you are not scared, do what your General just did. Yes, General. The Austrians will have corrected their aim. They won't miss this time. Well done! Now you can step down. That's a hero, an authentic hero. Take this. Have a glass of wine as soon as you can. Move it! Forward! Don't shoot. We won't shoot anymore. We'll leave when it gets dark. Shoot, help him die. I don't have the guts to shoot to him. A massacre... Captain. How many wire cutters do we have? Should be seven of them. Three larger and four small ones. - Bring them here immediately. - Yes, sir. - Sergeant. - Yes, sir. - The wire cutters. Captain, appoint one officer and two privates to cut holes in the enemy barbed wire. Second Lieutenant Avellini. There is still much fog. There is a risk that they won't find those holes that we have cut open. Soon there will be too little fog, and the Austrians will see them. The wire cutters are of no use neither by day or by night. We need artillery. Which we don't have. They are returning. Stretcher-bearer! One dead... and the cutters don't work. - These cut well, Major. - Show me. - Look. Then we must try again. The problem is not the wire cutters. However good, they'll change nothing. The Austrians shoot all who approach, with or without cutters. I'm in command here, and haven't requested your opinion. Captain, appoint an officer to command this mission. Lieutenant Sassu. Are you prepared to leave? Lieutenant Sassu has just returned from a mission. - Go and call Lieutenant Santini. - Yes, sir. No one knows the land better than him. Hey, you must speak up, or they swindle you. Are you willing to go on a mission with the wire cutters? - It's too late. It's impossible now. - I didn't ask you if it's early or late. I asked you if you would offer to volunteer. No, sir. This is cowardice. Sir, you asked me a question. I gave you an answer. It's not about cowardice, nor courage. You don't offer to volunteer? No, sir. Then I order you to go anyway, and immediately! If it's an order... then I have to obey. Take the cutters. You, go with the Lieutenant. How come you've never gone on a mission with the cutters? - If I got the order, I would. - Sure. Keep it as a memory of me. Let's go. Lieutenant! Lieutenant! Get down! Lieutenant! Shit! How can he die like that? Go back! 4th, 5th and 8th company are rebelling! Men on-duty and off-duty, everybody, let's get out. Everybody out, come on! There's a revolution going on! We've had enough of war! Come on! The 8th company has mutinied as well! Come on! Silence. Line up. Line up! Grab your guns! They are doing stupid things outside. It's not the right way to do this. Only you will end up paying for this... You know what I think. I'll be with you when the time is right. We want a changeover, we have the right to a rest day. Let's put an end to trench digging, give us a changeover! It's unfair! A changeover, we have the right to rest. Soldiers! Return to your shelters. A day of rest! We all have the right to rest, even me, at my age. Now return to your shelters. It's your Colonel. And for your own interests, he orders you to obey. Assemble the men, Major. Assemble the companies. Attention. Lieutenant Ottolenghi, can I count on your company? Yes, sir. Can I count on your company if I'd order you to take part against the mutineers? I don't think so, Colonel. Give me a straight answer. Will you or will you not take part? No, sir. In any case, your company must be on hand. Attention! At ease. Attention! Proceed! Charge! Soldiers, for the last time, return to your shelters. Firing squad, at ease! That's the result... These things should either be done well, or not at all. That was very courageous the way you answered the Colonel. Why, what would you had done? That's what I'm asking myself. Would you have shot the soldiers? Sometimes one doesn't know what one's duty is. No! In this case there was only one decision. You forget that we are at war and that we must win. National unit is too important to risk jeopardizing by speaking in front of the soldiers the way you did. Why? Did I say something you didn't like? You said that at the right time you'd be on their side. Which side? To do what? To shoot our commanders. Then shoot all the commanders, even those of the enemy. - Strike hard and shoot as many as possible! - Be quiet... Beginning with the commanders of our division! I see. And then? I'll work my way through the hierarchy. How far? All the way to the capital, where enemy generals can be found. And then? The people seize government power. That's socialism. Sure. You make it sound easy... Do you really think it would be better that way? Do you know for sure? The only sure thing I know is to shoot. Then we'll see. Decimation can't be applied against soldiers who haven't used their arms. - But article 92 of the Code says... - But that is a code from 1869. But it's still valid. The article suggests 'capital punishment with dishonor' for a riot in front of the enemy. We are not in front of the enemy, we are in his presence... ...and for that reason this situation is covered by article 137 that suggests military jail. We are in front of the enemy, we are in the front line. Only an offensive operation would be in front of the enemy. Here we're only in the near presence. Dear Stringari... Tomorrow there'll be the attack. Tomorrow is not today. We will only win this war if our troops are treated according to the disciplinary method that we used in the colony with the Askaris. Our soldiers are citizens like you and me... The "Askaris" are all mercenaries, foreigners and colored. That's an essential difference to me. You've introduced philosophy in the army. That's the reason for our weakness. General Leone has communicated with the Command and confirms... That article 92 must be applied: Decimation. I haven't done anything, I don't want to die! Firing squad! Attention! Kneel down! Aim! Fire! This book you gave me is very nice, Lieutenant. All the birds are in it: The duck, the sea jay... the red woodpecker... the blackbird... ...and the thrush, which is my favorite. Roasted of course. What a clown! - Do you know where the thrushes come from? - No, Lieutenant. From Germany. They can come from wherever... on the spit they are all good. Spits are important, Lieutenant... They should never be of iron, they must be wooden. First you have to try the spit roast... to understand if it tastes good. I know about these things. I am Sardinian, I know the country like you do. How will this war end, Lieutenant? We'll end up like the thrushes to conquer these few stones. That's also a piece of Italy. Have a look at this, it's a nice piece of Italy! - Beautiful! - Take a look at that! - Let's go and show it to the General... - Come on, hand it over! This is better than cognac! Show it to me too! That's enough now! Silence! You'll wake up the sniper, you know that. Lieutenant, let me introduce the best Austrian sniper of the front. I'll show you how he works. Give me that piece of wood. Careful, some already have already died, so get down. You saw that? He never misses. Now even trickier... a cigarette. That's enough playing around. As of today, loophole 14 will be closed. Here is the famous Fasina armors... Especially famous... because they allow extremely bold actions in broad daylight. The enemy may have guns, machine guns, cannons... With the Fasina armor we can get through anyway. - Make way! - Attention! Go ahead and spread out! The Roman soldiers were victorious thanks to their armor. Are we still going to attack at 9:00? There are just a few seconds left. Indeed. - Give the order. - Officers, take your positions. Get ready for the attack. Officers, take your positions. Get ready for the attack. Savoia! Savoia! Glory! Let's move! Glory! Enough, Italian soldiers, enough! We can't keep killing like that. Go back! Enough. Stop it! Stop it! Enough with this poor people's war! Against poor people! Forward! Soldiers of my glorious division, forward! There is our enemy, behind us! Soldiers, stand up! Let's shoot there! Help me. You have left your battle position. The battle is over. It was useless to... It's also useless to bring a cadaver. He was still alive. I want to know the name of the officer in charge. Who's responsible for this sector? Answer me! - Who's in charge of these loopholes? - I don't know, General. - I want to know his name. - I am the officer in charge. Well... you again. Get the battalion to retreat. Follow me! Your loopholes do not serve any purpose. It is the nature of the terrain... I couldn't care less... about the terrain! Your loopholes are only useful for searching for crickets, and not for observing the enemy line and to study the attack... How do you justify yourself? We want the stretcher-bearers! I asked you to justify yourself! Answer me. Further on there's the best loophole of this sector. Up there... Number 14... you can see the enemy line perfectly. I don't think so! But I will have a look. Only one at a time can watch. Magnificent, absolutely magnificent. Very good, Lieutenant. This was useful for the attack. Continue watching... There is a white rock... Can you see it? Sure I see it. I believe it's the enemy's weakest spot... Yes, possibly. Possibly so. Shit! Hey! Give us a hand to remove it from the mud... Please... it got bogged down in the mud. Come on, boys. Like this, come on. It'll take just a minute. Thank you. Lieutenant. Lieutenant, see the fourth? It's Lieutenant Ottolenghi. We're ready, Lieutenant. Lieutenant, when I get leave, I won't be back. I don't think it's likely anyone'll be getting leave, and I would report you for saying that. Get in. - You will never report me. - Let's move, come on. Come on! Evident blackish mark... the burned edges of the hole... Marks of explosive combustion. The shot has without doubt been fired from a short distance. You have inflicted this wound yourself. No, Colonel, I got hurt in the fray during the attack. Firearms are not used in the fray, only bayonets or daggers are used. I was shot from behind by an Austrian officer. If he was behind you, the palm of the hand should have to be on the body of the officer. Write: Self-inflicted wound, bring it to the military court. Next. Francesco Di Giovanni! - Present. - Go. Well, tell us what happened. I was on the lookout, Colonel... While I was cleaning my rifle... as the Lieutenant had ordered us, a shot went off... Impossible. Self-inflicted wound. Military Court. Bring the next one. - Colonel... - Go away. It's an impossible thought that an Italian officer would issue an order to a sentry on post to not make use of his weapon. And you? We were in trenches before the attack, Colonel... ...when the gun of the soldier beside me went off. - Beside you, where? - By my side. To the right or the left? To the right. Is that so? Why did he shoot? I don't know, I was drunk. They gave us a full case of cognac before the attack, sir. What's this soldier's name? Do you know? Luigi Esposito, sir. And he can't testify because he died in the attack, right? That's right, sir. And you don't remember the names of other soldiers that were present, right? That's right, sir. Then go right to the Military Court. Bring the next one. - Salvatore Annunziata. - Present. None of the characteristic point-blank marks on this man, but anyway... I'll explain to you how it's done: You took a piece of bread and put it in the palm of your hand before firing the shot. That way, the bread gets the burned mark. It is an old trick that cowards use, and that's how this coward deserted the field of danger and honor. Military Court! Bring the next one. Come! - Dormitory 18? - Down there on your left, Lieutenant. Excuse me, can you tell me where Captain Abbati is? He's right here, I'll show you. I don't want to wake him, but I can't wait to see him. Is it still serious? Yes, he suffers a lot. He doesn't sleep at night. - I wanted to give him... - Wait, he's waking up. French cognac. You have learned to drink... I drink... Today we will win, because that is written in the book of destiny. This morning when I saw our soldiers entering our town in celebration, accompanied by fanfares, filled with life and youth, I understood, and all the people with me, that war has a certain charm. Beautiful and sublime charm. Miserable are those who can't feel it... Because, gentlemen, it is beautiful to die for the fatherland in the glorious war that the Italian people are fighting under the brilliant and heroic leadership of His Majesty the King. - Long live the King! - Long live the King! Long live our glorious King of warrior descent! Long live the King! To arms! To arms! - What's happening? - A deserter. - Who is it? - Marrasi. That disloyal swine. Return immediately! Lieutenant, I've said it many times... that rascal would escape one day. - I knew it. - He's getting up! Son of a bitch! Kamerad! Lieutenant, Marrasi fooled you. Kamerad! This is a dishonor for my battalion. Lieutenant Pavan! - Yes, sir. - Shoot the deserter. Shoot the deserter! Shoot the deserter! Shoot him! Shoot him! Shoot him! Kamerad! Kamerad! Tomorrow we'll attack. No, not tomorrow, we haven't been given either chocolate or cognac. It will arrive late when we are dead already. Little by little they're killing us all, without chocolate and cognac. That way, they scrimp on us and make a profit. They'd pull out of our stomach all of the tinned food we have eaten. And why not? For them we are all sons of bitches. - Remember that. - I won't attack without cognac. They will get you to go, a couple of 'carabinieri' will kick your ass. I saw two barrels of cognac arrive this morning. No need to worry, no? Anyway, even the officers die. But if they die, they die comfortably. You're right... steak for breakfast, lunch and dinner. With their monthly income, my family would live 2 years. They called off the leave permits. What wouldn't I give to be in my house. Well, home... I tell you the truth, it was as badly off hoeing the ground... as I'm here, it doesn't make any difference. But no one died, for heaven's sake. I 'd be prepared to die if I thought it would end this war. Instead we die for nothing. I don't want to sacrifice my life for them. Look out! No one must sleep. Look out! Your General isn't sleeping. Look out! A sleeping soldier is a dead soldier. Look out! No one must sleep. Look out! Have you seen the shoes given to the soldiers the other day? Made of cardboard. Speculators make money at our expenses... and the government protects them. And we're fighting for this Italy. - Boys... General Leone is dead! - Who told you that? It's what the soldiers are saying. One moment! - Gentlemen, I propose a toast. - Yes, let's do it. Once a strong nation celebrated the death of their leader with a banquet. As we have nothing better to offer than this wine, we'll drink to the memory of General Leone. Gentlemen, raise your glasses with me. - Cheers! - Hooray! Another glass! Officers! Attention! What is the reason for all this celebration? Well? The gold medal that has been granted to the regimental flag. May I join you? But let's also drink to the Italian artillery, which will allow my glorious division to attack on all the front. Cheers. Quickly! Get fire adjusted! They are butchering us! Artillery command... Adjust fire! - Nobody must move before the attack. - Yes, sir. Get back to the shelters! Move it, get back! Come on, boys. Nobody must move before the attack. Inside! Come on, get inside! Get a move on! Inside! Go to the end of the cave! Quickly! Come on! Quickly! Help us as well to bring in the wounded. Quickly, get a move on! Don't move from your shelters! Inside you'll be safe! Don't be afraid, it's rock, it won't fall down! You're all safe, don't be afraid! Get back in the caves! Let's move! I want to get out, out! Get back! Everyone to the shelters! Obey the orders, get into your shelters! Don't anybody dare move, we are in front of the enemy! Return to the shelters! Don't do anything stupid, obey! - Go back! - Obey! Return to the frontline! We're in front of the enemy! To the shelters! Make them return! Lieutenant, make them return! I said get into the shelters! Come back! Come back here! Line up, everyone in a row! Line up! Obey! Line up! They have rebelled! Their order was not to move, from their positions before the attack. - Pick out every tenth man! - But, sir... 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9... you. I'm applying the decree from the Supreme Command about capital punishment under special circumstances. - No rebellion has occurred here, Major! - That's for me to decide! If they are rebels, they disobeyed an order. You can't execute a soldier without the approval of the Command. Shut up, or it will make you an accomplice of rebellion and guilty of the same crime. I am the only one responsible in front of the Supreme Command. At this moment, facing the enemy, I am the judge over the life and death of the soldiers under my command if they breach the discipline of war! Lieutenant Sassu, take command of the firing squad. I'm the company commander, I can't command a firing squad. Lieutenant Sassu, obey the order I have given you! No, sir. - You take the command! - Yes, sir. Line up! In the name of His Majesty the King, I, Major Ruggero Malchiodi, commanding officer of the 2nd Battalion of the 291st Infantry Division, endorsed by the exceptional orders given by H. E. General Cadorna, hereby order the execution of the soldiers guilty of armed rebellion in front of the enemy. Proceed! Firing squad! Attention! Proceed! Ready! Aim! Fire! Fire in the air! Very well, I will punish the rebels myself! Major! You are out of your mind! First company, attack! Second company, attack! Third company, forward! Forward! Forward! Lieutenant Sassu. Bring him in. We have met before, Lieutenant, if I'm not mistaken. Yes, sir. You can consider yourself very lucky. You are not dead yet. No, General. - And you were never hurt? - No, sir. Strange. You are an officer of my division and you have never been hurt? Only minor wounds, sir. No, no... I'm speaking of severe wounds. Serious wounds. No, sir. How do you explain that? I don't know exactly, General. Have you taken part in all the attacks of my division? Yes, all of them. Very strange indeed. You're not being modest now, by any chance? I don't believe so, sir. You don't believe or are you sure? In war you can't be sure of anything, General. Do you love the war? I was in favor of the war, General. I represented the interventionist group at the university. But, Lieutenant, that is of the past, I'm talking to you about the present. I do my duty. Lieutenant, I did not ask if you are doing your duty. In war everybody do their duty, otherwise they risk being shot. I asked you if you love the war, or not. A man who has looked war in the face doesn't want to speak about it. Tell me the truth. Are you in favor of peace? - General, I believe that... - Stand straight! To attention. What kind of peace would you like? Genuine peace. Unfortunately, Lieutenant, all this has confirmed the idea I have had of you. One cannot love peace and fight a good war. Your behavior caused the death of Major Malchiodi. Because it's your fault if those men disobeyed. Yes, sir, I admit that. Do you know why? Because the soldiers knew about your subversive ideas, and so they behaved like rebels. This can not go unpunished. They were decimated during the battle, I take responsibility for them. Do you know what awaits you? Yes, sir. Firing squad! Attention! One step forward! First row, on your knees. Second row, one step forward! Ready! Aim! Fire! Stop! Firing squad. Right turn. Forward, march.
