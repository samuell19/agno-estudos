Princess Inada is desperate because she has been chosen as a human sacrifice to placate Orochi, the huge serpent. But the ancient god Susanoo no Mikato appears. He looks for a way to save Inada. They serve Orochi countless bottles of sake until Susanoo is able to kill the serpent. A Japanese artist called Tamasaburo Bando stands before us. He has great talent as a dancer in Kabuki theatre. His name is famous everywhere. The entire village is awaiting him. We are happy and proud that he is appearing in our Uchiko-za theatre. This silence while I make up makes me uneasy. But too much noise is no better. Très joli, molto bello. This is unique. There are so many strange things. But it is beautiful. It is a shame that you cannot see the mountains today. Formerly I thought that I could act like a woman. But then I recognised that I have never seen the world with the eyes of a woman. Never with her own eyes. I understood that my vision is that of a man. I act a woman with the eyes and the feelings of a man; like a man painting the portrait of a woman. This is how I give shape to an Onnagata rôle. I try to portray an ideal image of woman, in the same way a male writer describes feminine feelings from the standpoint of a man. I do not represent a woman, but I suggest the essence of woman. That is the nature of the Onnagata, isn't it? I gather up knowledge about women. I watch different women: this is how they react, this is how they place their hand on their hair when they are thinking. I gather up this type of material and transform it. Thus my masculine instinct evolves naturally. In such a way, models of womanliness take shape. This is how I proceed. I've switched on Time. - Time. - Time? How do you play that? Oh, now I understand. Wouldn't you rather go into the theatre? - Yes, let's go. - Take off your shoes. Please switch it off, otherwise the batteries will run out. A dog is barking. Kuronoshi, disguised as Sekibei, the guardian of a barrier, is planning to take over the imperial power. He becomes drunk and notices the stars reflected in a bowl of sake. - Now I have lost. - Have you? For how long have you been playing this game? - How old were you? - I don't know. Sometimes I play other games. When? Well, I... go on. Now you must press Time. - Do we want to go into the theatre? - Yes. Let's go. Kabuki. Sekibei takes the reflection of the stars in the sake as a sign. If he makes a burnt offering with wood from the cherry tree, his plan to become emperor will come true. Trying to cut down the tree, he is stopped by the spirit of the tree in the form of the courtesan Sumizome who finally triumphs. No, I am not a Kabuki professor. I am just an actor. The Onnagata is often said to be more feminine than women themselves. That sounds simple. There are however women whom I feel are exceptional in their fe- mininity: for example Garbo or Dietrich; Hollywood made them into a type of identifiable artistic symbol. Han Takehara and Haruko Sugimura are a similar phenomenon. The fact that they are women can be withheld at first. Then their performing material can be laid out and they can draw on what is useful and set it out in "preparation", as if in a cooking process. These, I believe, are women with an extraordinary talent. Excuse me. First I bow, then I close the fan, then I bow again and stand up, then I go over there... about here I look back. When a man plays a woman he observes her very exactly, with much closer attention than women do among themselves. That is why an Onnagata, an actor of women's rôles, can show many things which are unknown to a woman. That is why I believe that I have learnt a great deal from men, from Onnagatas. It is impossible to act exactly like them. Why are women's rôles acted by women often more boring than Onnagata interpretations? They seem more colourless on stage than when men play their parts. The great performer Han Takehara was too broad-shouldered for the May Dance. And from the beginning the great actress Haruko Sugimura played mothers because she was not considered beautiful. By awareness of their own imperfections, both were able to see themselves more objectively. As a man who plays women's rôles, my situation is similar. Furthermore I have had a disabled leg since my youth. That has made me more sensitive in movement. And I am too tall. I am taller than all former Japanese performers of women's rôles. I can consider my size objectively. As in a cooking process, I dissect and "prepare" myself. It seems strange that a weakness can become an advantage, but I have sought to work with these imperfections. I always wanted to act in theatre. When I was young, a woman who wanted to go into film had above all to be beautiful. Therefore I did not even dream of becoming a film actress. What? Tabe San! Tabe San! We have not seen each other for a long time. Stay seated and wait a moment. Excuse me. Leave that! When a woman gets ready, she likes to be alone. The 21st century is about to begin. I do not know what the world will look like. But the essential substance of which people and their feelings are made will not change. Film is first and foremost entertainment. But it also allows us to think about life in general. That is why it will not disappear. We live in a time of transition. And nothing goes on forever, neither good things nor bad things. It smells odd. What are you burning? Only the cigarette butt. I have nothing to say. That is why I dance and act. Which is where everything I wish to express can be seen. Things which are impossible to say. The substance of what I want to say lies in the act of looking back or of putting on a costume. Of course I use language to help when I try to explain my feelings, or ideas. I choose my words carefully, arrange and connect them as if editing a film. Nonetheless words only have a secondary nature for me. For me, movement is something which comes from one's own heart and to which I give form. Do you understand? With sadness, when I am sad, thoughtfully, when I am thoughtful. Just so, I move my body and my heart. That's how it is. People who know how to play like children, adapt every space which is given to them. From an isolated space capsule, they can create a cosmos. Such, I think, are people with a theatrical soul. My twilight Geisha time will soon be over. It is moving into evening sunlight. Time passes like the critically decisive instant... One cannot choose, the questions remain open, in this unique twilight zone in which the destiny of man is played out. From the beginning onwards. Geisha? I began early as a Geisha. In the 43rd year of the Meiji era I entered a Geisha school in Yanagibashi. I started as a 16-year-old. So I have worked as a Geisha for 80 years, as I am 101 years old today. Please relax. We are leaving Osaka, in order to hide away. We are fleeing, today in the hut of Nara, tomorrow in Miwa's teahouse. You are angry, I know, but we must submit to destiny. Thank you. When I am in the house, I think of love. When I go outside, I think of love. A light breeze and a full moon are not as beautiful as we are. Even a couple of mandarin ducks, who always fly together, do not love as much as we do. Now the beautiful time has passed. Only a memory remains. A maiden who has been abandoned by her lover goes mad and dies. Finding no peace, she reappears as the reincarnation of a heron. In different shapes she dances on a snowy winter's night.
