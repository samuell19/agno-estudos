- Is everything ok? - All's fine. I'll feel better tonight when they leave satisfied. Please do a water refill over there. And tell Antoine to stop confusing a cigarette break with retirement. Your shoelace is undone. But yes, besides that, overall, all's fine. Thank you. A problem? No, it's going wonderfully well. Everyone is very happy. I'm glad. What about you, dear? Ready? When I'm with you, I'm always fine. You're the best man there is. Want this? Good dog. It isn't rotten when it's organic. The time has come to hand over the domain to my daughter, as my father did when he was my age. Yes, we retire young in our family. Allow me to take my final bow with the family motto. There is nothing... more important than the wine! Thanks to all of you. Now, to you! To your health! To you all! - To you, my dear. - To you. Come on! Heat up won't you! DANCING ON You're being a bit cheeky, aren't you! There we go. My darling daughter! Your timing is perfect. Your cheeky son is trying to steal my dessert. So California? Is the weather nice? Yup. 32 degrees. I'm glad to come home soon. You're a masochist, darling. - I have wine in my blood. - Yeah, right. So, want to speak to Lucas? Sure, but first I'd like to know how's my future ex-boss doing? Well, listen, your Dad, I'm not sure, but I'm... that's if you're interested, I've never felt better. We all know you're the man for the job. Did you tell him about the cruise? No, not yet. - A dance, beautiful Sandra? - Only with Paul. Paul sure is lucky. Anyway, dear... I've already told you, but I'm happy you're the one taking over. Yeah, but you don't know about all the projects I have in mind. That may bother your father but for me what I leave behind, stays behind. What I really need is some time alone with your father. You deserve it, Mom. You're sweet. I can't see him anywhere. You know the saying, following Dad is following the wine. Yes, you're right. When did you say you're coming? Paul? - It's not what you think. - Good then. What I think, is that you're really... I don't even want to say it out loud. And like an idiot, I believed in you, in us, what we'd built together... Don't be silly. I was silly enough to spend my life taking care of you and your dreams. Just to get dumped one day. - I'm not dumping you! - Too coward for that! How long has it been? It's complicated. I've known her forever. That's not an answer. Since Bordeaux. Two years? It's been two years? So, I'm the stone in your shoe, right? I wasn't born in a nearby castle. This stone is getting out of here! - Where to? - None of your business. Can't we talk about this quietly? Let's avoid putting on a show. Ha, what will they say? Huh? A bourgeois' worst nightmare. Well done. For two years. In my own home. We were waiting for the right moment. You and your great speeches on women's solidarity. That starts with not stealing husbands. Rozenn? It mustn't be easy loving a coward! - Ready? - It's the 10th time you've asked me! Trust does not exclude control, boy. So, fuel level? - Ok! - Reverse switch? Ok! - Water filters? - Ok! Propeller shaft? Ok! Controls? Ok! - Let's start the engine. - Start it. Let's go. You smell what I smell? Gasoline? No, the tulips! Spring in Holland. The great departure! What's that in your hand? That's called a serflex, boy. Oh, shit! Yeah... - Yeah? - Roberto? It's Danie. - Danie? - Am I disturbing you? No, not at all! My boiler has just died. It was practically brand new. Your boiler just died. Ok, I'm on my way. So you're a flood-lover? I ran a restaurant, I'm not a plumber. Come on! Turn it off! Practically new? Like me! Danie, I swear, your house is falling to pieces! You know my thoughts on that. A house is a graveyard for the living. Without heating, it will be your graveyard. So, what can I do? Put on a sweater. I'll take a look, but my specialty is cars. You can do it. I'll make us some more tea. Good, go make some tea. - Add something to it! - Yeah. Wait 5 minutes? Yes, of course, ma'am. Thanks! Thank you, that's very kind. No doorbell? I've been calling you. Why didn't you answer? My phone's not used to you. It must've had a nervous reaction. He's been unfaithful for two years. Can you believe it! I'm sorry, Sandra. I just left everything behind me. Good move. What would you know? Ok, have a seat. Is it me or is it freezing in here? Sorry, problem with the boiler. Since when? You could've told me, it's my home too. I don't need your money. You haven't changed a thing! Aren't you tired of Mom's furniture? I can't see why it bothers you. You never come here. What have you got to drink? My entire life spent by his side! And I get dumped just before... - Before the graveyard? - Oh, Danie! Well... I knocked something up but not sure it will hold. Hello. I've talked to you about my sister. I would recognize her even in the dark! Absolutely delighted! Pleased to meet you. - I'll walk you out. - Ok. I'll order the piece but it can take some time. Yeah, that's ok. It's cool she came. Wasn't it complicated between you two? Complicated? Even worse than that! We're sisters. You mind taking the suitcase upstairs? Not at all. As long as I don't have to stay. Just stop saying all the time that I never call you! Ever been to one of our parties? Partying with the snobs, my lifelong dream! You never really insisted, did you? I'm not the ideal sister that you want to present to your guests! Seeing you play your Che Guevara, good thing you never came. You see, you're ashamed of me! I don't see what's so revolutionary in finding it obscene to pay a month's wage on just a bottle of wine! Danie, do you realize it's been the same song for years? - And you? - What? - You still haven't answered. - About what? Was your marriage working or not? I don't understand the question. It's a simple question: Were you happy or not? I don't know, Danie... I don't know what that means...I don't know! Well, in bed? That's not the issue here, ok! Really? It's not the issue? He was cheating on you, so maybe it is the issue. Ah, you're incredible. Huh! Danie, the rebel, giving me advice on married life! Ok, forget it. Could you lower your voices please? If you have something to say, say it to our faces, not to him! No, ma'am, it was my idea, really... Yeah... Traitor. Here. Another one. Without the corked taste if possible. You want the truth? You just don't know how to live. Please enlighten me. We're all listening to you, huh! What's your advice on keeping a man? Your longest relationship was? An evening? Ah! No, I'm exaggerating. Sorry, a whole night, right? Sneaking out in the morning while he's asleep. Excuse me! At least I didn't trade in my freedom for a side role in my husband's dreams! - What did you say? - Bourgeois! What are you, Danie? A "beatnik", right? No one has said "Beatnik" since Giscard was president! Where are you going? She's completely crazy! Francis, call the police! Officer, I assure you, you're mistaken. It's just an unfortunate accident. Oh yeah! Setting a restaurant on fire? No, the candle fell over! We should sue you for defamation! Police violence! Stop! Aren't you overdoing it a bit? I'll never bow to the militia, understand? Shut up. Can I call my lawyer now? Nobody is calling their lawyer! This isn't the movies. Ok? You just wait, that's all. We're not afraid. We're not kids. Did you see that! He just looked at us like two old hags. Oh no, I never called you old hags. Calm down or I'll call the prosecutor. Ok, look, we're very calm, officer! Call the fucking prosecutor if you want! Call the prosecutor! I don't give a damn! You don't know what I am capable of! I'm starting to get a good idea. I see which side you'd have chosen in the 40s. At least I wasn't born in the 40s! See that? That's the second time, right? And you wonder why I never come. Hey, you've got a nerve. Remind me why we're here again? Wait a minute! Excuse me for trying to fix your mess! - My mess? - Yes, your mess. - I thought you didn't do anything? - No, but... - She's started the fire! - That's not true! What are you saying? I tried to put it out! Oh, yeah. She threw a glass of water at some poor guy's head! I can't aim well. Obviously, when you're drunk, nobody can aim well. Drunk? After 30 years in wine business? I don't think so. I had two glasses. You're right, you need to book her! Tell me you're leaving soon... I thought "You don't visit often enough"? You said: "I never come to your parties"! Can you be quiet please! - They're here. - Oh, no! Not them! Oh no! After the militia, now the Nazis wannabes! Hey! Nobody called you! You're ok, Tristan? Assault, insult, rebellion. The whole package. Abuse of power, making arrangements. Just get rid of them. Yeah, with pleasure! Come on! You coming? Well, goodbye, officer. - So, Danie, you're coming? - Ok, coming! It's all too easy, your huh,... We still have unfinished business! I'm allowed to go for a walk. Come on, time for beddy-byes! Oh, drop it, I'm not a three year old! Oh! But thanks all the same! My pleasure. What are you doing here? - I'm sorry about last night. - Me too. I made you a vegetable juice. Good for a hangover. - Is it organic? - Oh... You're a pain. Well, I'm off. I've taken Marx out. Why is your dog on my bed? Because it's his bed. You never come, I gave him your room. Ok. Why call the poor thing Marx? It's a girl... Careful. Her name is Miss Jenny Marx. But Marx is more... I left the keys on the table and some food in the fridge. - You're going? - To dance. Nice to meet you, Miss Jenny Marx, but I'm tired. And 1, 2, 3, 4. - You're late! 6, 7. - Didn't we say 10:13? Katarina... Good, go down further on your plié. Am I punished or can I go dance? Sandra? You don't want to speak to me? Sandra, please... Did it end well on Saturday? I've known better. Is Lucas okay? Sophie came home this morning. He was happy to see her. Tell her I'll call her back. I don't feel like talking right now. How's she doing? Good. We signed the last papers and then she kindly walked me out of my office saying I was always welcome. I remember your dad's face when you said you'd modernize the winemaking process. He didn't talk to me for two weeks. The wheel is turning, I'm the old fart, now. Even if I must confess that I didn't think it would happen so fast. Even though it's still a long way off, what are your plans for Christmas? Christmas? Why are you asking me that? For the 24th, the 25th, well for... For Lucas' gifts... For all that. Hey, I don't know, Paul, I... I can't project myself that far. I wanted to warn you. I invited Rozenn for Christmas. What? Well yes, it's for Lucas. So, you want my permission to give her my napkin ring? It's not like that, Sandra! Not at all! Don't call me back. Butterfly! Butterfly! Butterfly! Stop! Wait a moment... And thank you everyone. You've personalized it. It's yours now. That's all. It goes like this, you see... - I don't like this music. - Really? Why? It reminds me of that movie... With that guy, with the sinking ship. - Titanic? - Exactly! Why? Well, because, uh... I don't know, I can't explain. - Ah Lucien! - Yes, well, I know. No, it's fine. On the contrary, you're working hard. Really? Oh, yeah? It's always better than being late. So, please! Come and see! So, young people... - Why do I like her? - Stockholm Syndrome. The club's next projects. There is certain kindness to her. She's mellowed out since she started to limp. So, there's a retirement home and the cancer ward for sick children. Any volunteers? Ah, Danie? Not the old hags, eh! Why? They're not contagious. Just to be on the safe side.... So... It will be Danie, Lucien, Juliette and Pierre, for the Beausoleil retirement home. And Katarina, Catherine, Armelle and Jean-Laurent, you'll go do the penguin dance for the kids in hospital. In the meantime, if there are one or two of you who want to rehearse to look less dumb, come find me. Come on! See you soon! Aline and her famous listening skills! It moves me. I knew her before her Nobel Peace Prize. She put you in the penguin group? Who cares about the Perraudin project! Mr. Mayor, you have no right to do that. Ma'am! Fifteen years ago I became Mayor. My predecessor had already signed the demolition order. Yeah... you can make up all the stories you want. 20 years without safety standards. The rivets! They're all rusty, barely holding! - Renovate the building! - With what? You haven't paid the rent for years! You've taken away all our subsidies! Don't count on our votes! Something tells me you never have. All this to build fucking buildings! They're not fucking buildings. - Really? - No! 64 family apartments and 12 social housing units. It's more than just a shopping mall. It's jobs. It's life to the downtown area. What about the community? The Factory is full of associations, thousands of members, of all ages, of all origins, hundreds of actions out in the field. We keep this city alive! You don't seem aware of that, Mr. Mayor! Because you're doing such a great job I promised to relocate all the associations. But not in the same location! I will try to explain this nicely: You must accept to leave on your own, or I will have to evict you. Fuck, things are heating up out there. At least look at the blueprints! How can you be friends with this guy? An old childhood friend! Friends don't have to agree. I don't get it. Friendship has its reasons that reason ignores. Bourgeois solidarity. Marx! Look what I brought you. Look! I don't need a man. I need my dog. Are you ok? What's that? Oh, my God! You loaded it! Yes, I was cold. Some moron threw away the one I had. Too tacky maybe. A gnome isn't tacky, it's popular. You've always confused the two. This is a never-ending nightmare. You have to give it time. Paul called me earlier. It's like he's living his dream life. - Do you know her? - Yeah. She's not younger, nor prettier, She's just the obvious choice. She's Prince Charles' Camilla. Lady Di was hot, huh? I feel so silly. Just say stupid. It's lighter. Why do you always make fun of everything? Maybe it helps me get through life. - Not me. - It helps me. - Yeah, well not me! - It helps me! I don't see it that way. There are things that don't make me laugh. Well, they do me. Will you come dancing on Thursday? No. I think I've had my fair share of ridicule recently. You were an excellent dancer. If you say so. Hey, come here and look. See how you used to dance well Where did you get this? It's dad's Super 8s, I had them converted to DVD. - I was graceful, wasn't I? - Well... No. But... Look how you stand out from the others! Our eyes are only on you. You're the one who catches our eye. Yeah. That didn't stop the director from choosing Laurence Dubreuil. Laurence Dubreuil. The disciplined one... You were already a real psychopath. You're over-exaggerating. I remember how my muscles would ache when you forced me to practice with you Yeah, well, it worked out well for you, didn't it? You're in pretty good shape, right, sis? And you still dance. Obviously, you don't. No. Ballet dancer or nothing. Psychopath. - Yeah. - Yeah, Paul. Sorry, it's late. I didn't want to go to sleep with us being angry. That's a relief, you cannot imagine. I wanted you to know that, for you and Rozenn, Well, I really wish you, uh... all the worst that life can give. A nice horrible illness, uh... Uh, I don't know, a lupus, a lumbago, hemorrhoids, as long as you endure the worst sufferings imaginable. And not only health problems, accidents too... - Shit, the whole shebang, Paul! - Listen, Sandra. Shut up! I hope you and Rozenn choke on all your 16 pieces of proof of your noble lineage! Thanks! I hate dancing for old people. You're not exactly young yourself. I feel young in my mind. At our age, 15 or 20 years, is but a detail. The worms won't see any difference. Boy, with your cynicism, you're scary, Danie. It's not cynicism, it's irony. It's her way of staying young. The only advantage of being old enough to have known the old French Francs, is that I feel free to be myself. You want to control everything, right? So, let go a little. What? I don't want to control anything! Excuse me! Daddy used to call you Napoleon. You know what, Danie? I don't like the way you talk about me, I don't like the way you talk about life, or talk, full stop. How about I invite you all to lunch? Good idea! It's amazing how you are allergic to conflict! As a bailiff I've had enough conflict for a lifetime, don't you think? Yes, but with her it's love! We've been like this forever, right? Yes, anyways, rain check for lunch, I'm meeting my daughter. Ok, but a light lunch, I'm having trouble digesting things. Well, with pleasure, my Lord. Let's rob the rich to help the people! Come on Danie! I'm late! Thank you very much. You're so sweet to come and see me. I had meetings in Paris anyway. It's nice to take the trouble to lie to me. How are you doing, Mom? Well... Like this... Did you know? Not at all. But I'm not surprised. Why do you say that? I've heard you two talk more about roof renovations, than about weekends in Venice. It's nice here. I'd forgotten, you see. Your aunt and I grew up here. But I guess the urge to run far away was stronger. Running from what? I don't know. I wanted another kind of life. Is that why you did ballet? Perhaps. What will you do now, Mom? Hey, it's cool you had lunch with Danie. - Why? - What do you mean "why"? Why won't it be cool? I'm just saying that it was cool you guys had lunch together. But why are you telling me this? Why? I don't know! Because! You're pissing me off with your questions! I get the impression that she likes you, that's all. She's very reserved. We're both very shy. Yeah... - So, are you ready? - Oh, yeah! Well, don't be a smartass. - So, let's go. - Let's do it! So, fuel level? OK! - Reverse switch? - OK! - Water filters? - OK! - Propeller shaft? - What? - Propeller shaft? - Propeller shaft! Yep, OK! - Controls? - OK! Go on. - So, I start the engine? - Go. This time, it will be the right one. Sandra was supposed to come with us, but she had lunch with her daughter. Why are you telling me this? Why? Because! She seems to be a nice girl. - Sandra's daughter? - No, not her daughter. Sandra. The duchess is not simple. - It's not easy for her at the moment. - Fire up. Come on, let's go. Ok now, yeah! The sound of the sea. Damn it! What do you mean... I don't find it funny... Nah, but I'm telling you... Checklist! There's only this bourgeois event that gets you out of bed. - What are you saying? - Well, the Christmas tree! - You don't do a Christmas tree? - No. I don't even celebrate Christmas. It's the kind of bourgeois event I avoid. Christmas is not bourgeois, it's a family thing. - Yeah, well... I prefer my freedom. - You know what... You're mixing up bourgeoisie and family, you confuse freedom with loneliness, little sister. And I find that sad. If you say so. I have good memories here, don't you? You can, you were never here. The field rat that jumped ship at 9 years old... The little "Opera rat" please... It sounds more stylish. You exaggerate. I was here. I came back from time to time. Ok. The tree is too bourgeois, I get it. What about this? 'This is not too bourgeois for you? So, wait, let me be more precise: let's get something straight, chocolate... is allowed. - You do the honors. - Thanks. - So, where's the 24th? - It's that one... What are you doing? At my age, I can't take the risk of waiting, I need to go straight for the best! And the best, today, is Boris. Who's he? He's a lover I see once a month so he doesn't get attached. When it comes to love, it's not like riding a bike, you can forget. I need to keep things in working order. You've always been such a romantic. - Hi. - My Lord! A month is a long time! It's best to recover between visits. Don't be silly! Do you want a cup of herbal tea, Boris? They're noisy, aren't they, Jenny? Good night, Jenny. I hope you're wide awake today, I've got loads of new ideas. Hum! Ready and waiting. Holy cow, I am having an effect on you! I don't know what to say. Thank you, Napoleon? Yeah, thanks. You can thank me because he has seriously bad breath. He needed a good dentist as much as a mouth-to-mouth! I was just so scared. He'll be out in three days. What did you do to him to put him in such a state? Nothing! I made some tea, showed him a bit of shoulder and bam! Well. I'm impressed, huh? Sister Caliente! I need to stop with the old crones. They're too fragile. Maybe he would have wanted to end his life like that, with you as the last thing he sees. the angel of death. I don't really like having death hanging around me. You're afraid of death? Of course not. For a long time, not at all. And then I was born. STOP THE EVICTIONS Thursday, town hall. Be there! I'll be there. - What's the problem? - A quarrel with the mayor. So, Danie got it, huh? I'll do the choreography but not the daffodil in the hospital. Do what you want! Let me introduce you to my sister Sandra. You're so welcome here. Everyone is welcome here. It's even the DNA of this association. I would like to present Riad, dancer and choreographer, who will replace me while I manage the town hall. Ok. I'll show you. And you follow the moves. So... It goes: Turn. And clap nice and low. And clap nice and low. And left, right. Turn and stop. Ok, let's try that with the music? Let's start? Aline, turn on the music please? I didn't get half of that. Did you? Me neither. But we'll just follow his lead and it'll be ok. Ok, let's take in that energy. And again! Well done! Brilliant! My déboulés are a bit rusty, no? I'm off to see Nicole, I'm late. Courage. Want to practice a bit? Can we? Ah, great! Yeah, I'd love that. Shoulder! Elbow! Wrist! Hand! Wave, back and... Watch it... Stop! - You see! - Great! It happened seven years ago now. It's been seven years. - But how old are you? - I am 33 years old. - You were young, then. - Yeah, quite young. Well? What's the matter? I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. I can't stand seeing her like this. I can't take it anymore. So, my friend! How are you? Fine. Here's a registered letter. Sandra! A letter with acknowledgement of receipt. Can you sign here, please. That's all. - Here. - Thanks. For me it's bills, bills, bills... I wonder why I still like you? Don't know. - Have a nice day. - You too. So? It's a letter from his lawyer. I'm so sorry. I thought he'd beg me to come back. How silly of me. You still don't want to say "stupid"? Don't judge me Danie. But I can't give my life up like that. That's why my door is closed so that I don't receive letters like that. You understand? You're much braver than me, little sister. You see the day, It's love That it looks like Little sister, now is not the time. Needing nothing, wanting you Your song is so crappy. WELCOME TO BOURGOGNE Needing nothing, wanting you, Like red leaves fall in autumn, Well, go on now. You know love, Verona is what it looks like Watch the road, will you! You're crazy. Needing nothing, Wanting you... Oh yes, right! - Thanks for coming with me. - We had no other plans. Thanks. Oh, my God, I'd forgotten how obscenely luxurious this place was. I'll lock the doors, just in case. Now I love it, huh... Then again, you need to look like Sandra to live here. I don't. - But you're beautiful! - Yeah, you are. I know. You think she's beautiful, so why not tell her? Well no! If I say something nice, she'll push me away, for being the evil-doer of capitalism. She'll say: compliments are the opium of the people. Don't take it personally, but you're an enemy of the proletariat, that's the way it is! And I leave just as I arrived, with a suitcase and the feeling that I never belonged here. It's scary... He's an asshole! Oh no, Danie, Paul is not just a... Can't you say a sentence without adding a swear word to it? The French language doesn't have enough nuances for you? How do you say "asshole" in French? She's right. "Bastard" is worse, "idiot" is more acceptable. Insults require precision! And, this is a bailiff speaking. He's right, there's no equivalent: an asshole is an asshole. Although, if I may say so, Paul could be an equivalent. Let's go visit the cellar? It's so beautiful... Of course it's beautiful! When you look at the finishing touches they aren't perfect. There you go. A whole life's work! It's impressive! I'm sure if we took a few bottles, he wouldn't even notice. Don't touch a thing, please, Roberto. Half of it is yours! Counsellor Arrénault. - Am I right? - He is right. Although my thing was more foreclosures rather than compensation claims. Who cares! I trust a man of the law. - Thanks, comrade. - Comrade? This wine, it destroyed my life. - I just want to forget about it. - Destroy it all. What, destroy it all? You're kidding. I could never do that! It destroyed you, you should destroy it. 78. You know how much this bottle is worth? Less than 10 shrink sessions. 20! I know what I'm talking about. It'd just be simpler to take it. And a shame to waste! 78... he already knew Rozenn then. He said he has known her forever! He definitely knew her in 2001! - Me? - Yes! And 85 was a great year. No, not 85. In 85, he said no to a second child. If I can help... And no again in '86, no in '87, no again in '89, and obviously even less so in '92. Plus, 92 was a shitty year. Wow! A swear word! Are you guys ready? Sandra, I just wanted to say, I know how hard it's to be on your own again. Hi, Paul, - Danie. - Paul. - Always such a Gentleman. - No reason to be vulgar. Why not? Two minutes ago we were discussing the difference between "bitch" and "slut". - And fucking cow too! - And whore. I've come to get some of my things. You can take whatever you want, you know that. Don't worry. I took the minimum. I want to leave unburdened. - I'll drive. - Yes. Let's go. WELCOME TO BOURGOGNE SEE YOU SOON IN BOURGOGNE Oh, so sorry! - You should run behind the car! - I forgot the hats! We've seen it all with you! I thought you didn't want to dance? - You've changed your mind? - Yeah. On a lot of things. "The Factory"! Thank you! The wine is on me! It's a good one. War treasure! We can't let him destroy all these marvels! - No! - Be careful, sis. First the heat, now you're celebrating Christmas with friends and good wine. You're shifting to the other side? What I can I say, I experience things since my life is perfect. And I would do the same all over again. What a funny idea. - I would love to start all over again. - What would you do? Stained glass windows! Careful, I believe what people say. Like master builders of the Middle Ages, I'd go from one cathedral to another to renovate roses and bow windows, and make them even brighter. - And get closer to heaven... - Amen. What about you, Roberto? - Yes? - What would you do? If what? - If you could start all over again. - Pay social security payments. Then again, if you had paid, we wouldn't have met. - That's true. - Did you really do a foreclosure on him? Absolutely! To the bitter end! But with a lot of humanity! Yes, but please note: The bad guy is not the bailiff, it's the creditor... and possibly the bad payer. Me, in other words... Remember that Dad used to say, it's better to have the worst family than no family at all. Remember? I just figured out why he said that. Christmas eve with my sister is the best gift in the world. Well then, to family! - Yeah. - And to friends! To family and friends! And to Marx! And to the class struggle. And to love! And to love! It's peppery. What about you? - What did you get? - Oh, I can imagine. Fabulous! My dream come true. - So? - I don't know who you remind me of. The Village People, perhaps... That's so unfair, everything suits me. Lucien! Yes? That's for me? Swan Lake, you remembered. I'm not available on that day. Yeah, me neither. Really? Well, then ... Roberto? With pleasure, I love opera. Yes, but it's ballet. Great! I love Opera when it's ballet. No really, a total disaster, the worst Christmas ever! - That bad? - You can't even imagine! Dad, he was so embarrassed that he drank himself silly, Rozenn felt so awkward she was overdoing it! Call me Rozenn... No, call me Granny. No, call me Granny Rozenn! Oh, poor thing. And not to mention Lucas, who kept calling her "Ma'am" on purpose. What a nightmare! An overcooked turkey, melted ice-cream, warm wine, it was a depressing evening. That doesn't even make me happy. I'm not even happy to hear that. I guess the Christmas spirit has come down on me. Did Lucas like his presents? Yes, thank you. He'll call you tomorrow. I miss you both, you know. We miss you too. You are in our thoughts. - I love you, dear. - Me too. Come in! I love your barge. That's nice, thanks. Have you been living here long? It's been three years. Since my wife ended up in hospital. I'm sorry. That's life. One day, I'll sail away to Holland. When the time is right. - And why Holland? - I love tulips. When will it be the right time? I don't know. And we all met up again, After years on the road, And we all sit down for a meal, Everybody is here, At five o'clock in the evening When San Francisco fogs up, When San Francisco lights up, San Francisco, Where are you, Lizza and Luc, Sylvia, Wait for me Wait for me Danie! When did you start preparing your move? What are you on about? Roberto, Swan Lake? He's a great guy Roberto. Yeah, but... I'm not sure I'm over Paul yet. Are you in love with him, or the idea of loving him? You're a pain! So? What do you think? The intermission? A little short! And you? I wanted to be a ballet dancer when I was little. Really? So why didn't you? I did, I took the plunge! That's the problem. I didn't make it. It's a whole process figuring out why things happen or don't. And then I met Paul, we got married, I got pregnant. Not quite in that order, to be honest. I can totally see you as ballet dancer. Danie would say I'm more of a "Nutcracker" than "Swan Lake" but... Wait, isn't that your car? Oh no! Sir, no! At night, it's free. It's reserved for the Town Hall. We've just come from the Town Hall. Big deal, are you the Mayor? Ok, all right. I hadn't seen that! Is that supposed to reassure me? Sir, be nice, it's Christmas! I'm sorry, I work for the car pound, not Santa Claus! How much will it cost? 150 euros for the pick-up, 29 euros for storage. Plus the fine. What if we only pay the fine? Right! And you'll give me a pretty pasta necklace and big hugs? - Bye, Sir! - Hey! But you're crazy! As revolutions Are now done at home And only when the world implodes It's just a new show! Show! It's time again Oh, time again! To take a breath again It's time again To jump into the water Thanks for the limousine service. Thanks for inviting me. I don't know what to say. There is nothing to say. - Good night. - Good night. So, I said that's funny, when we had talked with Jean-Yves, he said "certainly not", we had already met with Sylvie. And Jean-Marc. I like Jean-Marc by the way, he is... Here you go. - Don't feed him. - Just the one! No, then she won't eat what we give her. It helps her purge, no? Purge? Madonna style! Ok, let's go! I said: "When did you get here?" You won't guess what she answered! She says: "That's the first time someone has ever said that to me," She says that to me! It's a dog, isn't it... So what? It's not a rabbit. Here, it's the same. It's not by doing... - Put your hands like this. - Yeah, look! Hi there! Penguins! Bye-bye. We have to stop the penguin thing. Fuck, yeah! We looked like idiots! - Who organized it? - Aline. It's for 3-year-olds, not for... No, it's that way. In 17th century Holland, it was even the first financial crisis in history. But... I didn't know. Tulips fascinated people so much, that a simple bulb could cost up to ten years' salary. Then the value of tulips collapsed, it became a simple flower again. Well... Not just a flower, if you ask me. Robert. Roberto. Roberto is not just a nickname. Ok, sorry. - So, Roberto. - Yes. You are the only restaurant-owner/plumber I know, who loves tulips so much. Is something wrong? It's from Nicole's clinic. I don't understand. Is your wife still in the clinic? Well, yeah. - I thought she had passed away. - No. She has Alzheimer's stage 7. Sandra, this doesn't change a thing for the two of us! It changes everything Roberto. No! Sandra... Why didn't you tell me? I thought you knew. You thought I knew? You really don't know me, sis. We don't see each other often. And leave that gnome alone, he hasn't done anything. Let the sun come in. You have no right. - The Prefect says we do, ma'am. - Can I see? Let us empty out our stuff, we have all our instruments inside. You'll see that with the judge. There's nothing we can do. Flexibility isn't forbidden, young man. Take it from an experienced older colleague. Fine, go get your instruments. - Thank you. - Then leave, I have to do the inventory. Ok, we get it. Hello? Is the Mayor here? You're late. - You think I'm an asshole? - I don't judge. I'm just trying to understand. I like all these people, but I have no choice. We always have a choice. You taught me that. If it comes down to renovating my town, or ending up in jail because I welcomed the public in a dilapidated venue, then it's a quick decision to make. So, do I rinse them? No, it takes away all the iodine. That's disgusting, there are still bits of sea-shell. You're a pain! Don't rinse mine! That's insane! - Why don't you start again from scratch? - Impossible. The State and the promoters will sue me for the next ten years. I don't have the time, nor the money. Why are you laughing? Back in the days, that wouldn't have frightened "Jojo the Che". You were a real show-off back then, with your long hair and beard. You can talk! I still have your political manifesto, your 101 bullshit proposals, for a proletarian and inclusive revolution! No. Humanist and inclusive! Right. Trotsky was a big softy, compared to you. There you go. 40 years later, we're arguing about whether to rinse our oysters or not. I still buy my newspaper. I don't wear my Medal of Honor. No pasaran, my Jojo! No pasaran! Sandra? I know you're here. Fuck off! You're improving with the swear words. Can we talk for a sec? We need your help. We need everyone's help. What do we do? Drink. When we don't know what to do, we drink. Always drink! I'll toast with you but... Drinking is nice, but we still have to find a solution. We resist. We go further than last time. Simon you're right. We have to be more radical here. Like what: a bomb? A political assassination? Funny. Did you talk to him? Yep. He won't budge. He says he did what he could. We have to face the facts, right. He was elected, well elected, he was re-elected, well re-elected. Frankly, perhaps we should accept his proposal to relocate us. You can't say that! We've done everything we could! The petitions, sit-ins, we boycotted the "galette des Rois". and God knows his "galette des Rois" was good! We invaded his Party Headquarters, we created a buzz at the town hall! We lost! What do you want me to say? We lost because we didn't play tough. Ok, I can accept that. But, what does playing tough mean? You really want to know? Come, Riad, I need to five minutes. - Your sister is funny. - My sister has ideas. - Right? - Yeah. My dear friends, thank you for being here for the inauguration of... Must be some fans... I was saying, my dear friends, the inauguration of this magnificent shopping mall, the long-awaited first step in the renovation of the downtown area. Ok! Our friends from The Factory. - Should I call the cops? - No. - What do we do now? - We just smile like idiots. Nice show, Mrs. Georges, I'm impressed. It's very moving. That's not me, Mr. Mayor, the show is Riad Guerfa, a young person at odds with society that you entrust us with at The Factory. You said you were particularly attached to The Factory, and that you knew its history, I brought you a small gift. It's a rivet from the glass canopy. And it's true, it's very rusty. It dates back to a time when we believed in paid vacations, in living together and having a brighter future. So take it. Tell us if we were right to believe, Mr. Mayor. That's not the problem. Absolutely. The problem is them, your constituents. They don't seem very concerned, if I may say so. Oh, yeah? Go! Come on, Jojo! Be worthy of our 20s! You realize we're going to be sued here, Mr. Mayor? No pasaran, my friend. Well done! That was great! Pester him... ...to the bitter end. - How did you find me? - It wasn't complicated. You've got half the town on Instagram. So, what do you want? I apologize for everything I've done. Apology accepted. I've left Rozenn. I'd like you to come back. Why? She didn't finish the dishes? I'm sorry for what has happened, you can't give up on us like that. What, me give up? It's me who gave up on us? It's been too hard, Paul, I can't come back from that. I've always loved you. I still love you. I can't live without you. Give us a second chance. I beg you. What would Bogart do to look cool, if he were in my shoes now? Nothing. Impassive. Yeah, I see what you mean... A restaurant-owner/actor is way better than a restaurant-owner/plumber. - Are you sure about this? - No. But I'm not like you. I am not able to start my Advent calendar with the chocolate of the 24th. I trust you. If I'm sure about one thing, little sister... And I say this with all my love, you have amazing friends, who are there for you, who love you. So, trust them a little bit, huh? Let them love you. I'm going to miss you. Look, they've just finished the roof. Yeah, that's nice. No worries, there are no bills! It's a gift from your sister. - Have a nice day. - Bye. Darling... Was it good? Yes. I have to work on my backhand. You've got mail. Here you go. "Dear Sandra, "I am sad to tell you that Nicole passed away a month ago. "My grief is immense, "even if it comforts me a little to know "she began her great journey in her sleep. "This painful event has reminded me, "that life is short "and it's never too late to enjoy it. "I decided to cast off on April 27th. "I've chosen that day because "it's your birthday. "So, if you still dream of the stars, "you're invited to come and see "the tulips in full bloom. "Robert." - Are you ok, darling? - Yeah. We need to talk about your cake. - Really? - What about a pyramid with macaroons? - Yeah, sounds great. - Go on and order it. Oh, by the way, what are we eating tonight? - Duck. - Great. Be careful, last time you overcooked it a bit. - Your turn. - Yes! Gifts! You've spoilt us. - Beautiful! Thanks. - I love it. - A big thank you! - Thank you very much. Come on, buddy. If you change your mind, you know where to find me. Maybe we'll pass by this summer. - Huh? - Yeah. I'll miss you just little a bit. Us too. We're going to miss you. Come on! I'll be ok. Your change! Keep it! Where is he? Where is he? - Well, uh... Over there! - I love you! Good luck! Well... Sandra! I thought you weren't coming! - Neither did I! - What are you doing? The big leap!
