He's a man that used to take kids to school, but he made the girls disappear. In the dirt roads is where he robbed most of them. But that happened in Paraguay... Yes, but the other day, at you Grandma's house, ... I saw on the news that a girl was kidnapped here in Buenos Aires.... ... and I feel that this paper was written by that girl. ("HELP") And I also have this. Who is she? She's the sister of my second cousin, Iris. Since her six years old that she no longer exists. Because somebody kidnapped her. What's that? and didn't let her see her family ever again. It means that a bad person took her and didn't let her see her family ever again. and didn't let her see her family ever again. Many people there in General Delgado, said they saw him... ... so maybe the "School bus Driver" took her. Here, there was a case of a girl who disappeared... and her mother started looking for her... and once they found written in the bathroom door of a gas station her name... ... warning that she was alive. Nerina, it's scary... I told you, now my mom is going to be mad at me... Don't worry, we won't say anything. 1, 2, 3. A little sailor threw me a piece of paper, that paper said to marry him... ... I grabbed the pen and answered, that I would marry, but not him... that I would marry, but not him... if you'd marry that animal. Tell me little girl tell me the truth, if you'd marry that animal. if you'd marry that animal. I'm too young to be a mom... No mama, no papa, I'm too young to be a mom...

Once at school, it happened that a girl never came back. Viola was her name. A week before, she celebrated her birthday at her gradmother's swimming pool, And one day she stopped coming to school, but the teacher never said anything...
