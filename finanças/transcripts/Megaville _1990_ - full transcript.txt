[ MUSIC ] Newman: SOME FOOL ONCE TOLD ME THE ONLY REASON WE'RE HERE IS TO MAKE FRIENDS AND PROGENY. UTTER BULLSHIT. WOULDN'T YOU SAY? I'LL ADMIT-- THERE'S A BASTARD OR TWO RUNNING AROUND WITH MY DNA. BUT, AS FOR FRIENDS, HUH, COUNT 'EM-- TRY. I SUPPOSE THAT MAKES ME KING ASSHOLE, BUT, HEY, IF YOU'RE GONNA LIVE IN MEGAVILLE, THAT'S THE PRIMERO GROUND RULE. NEVER TRUST ANYBODY EXCEPT THE UGLY GUY IN THE MIRROR. TELL YOU WHY. THIS BEAUTIFUL KID I KNEW TRUSTED THE SYSTEM AND GOT HIS BRAIN SCRAMBLED LIKE-- I DON'T KNOW-- LIKE TWO FARM FRESH EGGS. HUH. NOW, IN THE HEMISPHERE, THEY CALL THAT SCIENCE. I'D CALL IT "MIND FUCK." CATCH MY DRIFT? IF YOU DON'T WANNA END UP LIKE HIM, PASS THE WARNING-- TRUST NO ONE. COME HERE, BOY! [ MUSIC ] FALL IN! WHAT'S GOING ON, NOW? [ MUSIC ] [ INDISTINCT CHATTER ] NEVER MIND THE FIGHT. WE'LL TRY TO MAKE THE PASS AND BLOW IT UP AFTER US. NOW, COME ON-- GET GOING. FREEZE-- MEDIA POLICE! [ SCREAMING ] FREEZE! GET UP AGAINST THE WALL! [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] GO! OW! GET UP HERE! OVER HERE, NOW. GET OVER THERE, NOW! JUST STAY THERE. OKAY. [ HORSE GALLOPING ON TV ] [ MUSIC ] ALL RIGHT-- LET'S GO! AH! [ MUSIC ] PALINOV! BROTHERS... WE HAVE JUST ENTERED THE TEMPLE OF DECADENCE. THIS VILE CAVERN, RIGHT HERE IN OUR OWN HOMELAND, IS THE SPAWNING GROUND FOR MEDIA ENTERTAINMENT. PEOPLE IN THE BLACK MARKET SAY THAT THIS ENTERTAINMENT IS A HARMLESS DISTRACTION-- A HARMLESS DISTRACTION USED BY THE POWER STRUCTURE IN MEGAVILLE TO TELL OUR PEOPLE THAT MORAL AND DECENT LIFE IS WORTHLESS. MEDIA RELIES PURELY ON SEX, POINTLESS VIOLENCE, AND MINDLESS HUMOR TO COVER UP FOR THE MORAL EMPTINESS OF THE SOCIETY THAT IS PRODUCING IT. THE BLACK MARKET POISONS THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF OUR CITIZENS WITH MEDIA-- COMPARED TO THE ABUSE IN MEGAVILLE ITSELF. THERE IS-- THEY CALL IT DREAM-A-LIFE. THE POTENTIAL HARM FROM DREAM-A-LIFE IS UNFATHOMABLE. WE CAN ONLY HOPE AND PRAY THAT THIS POISON, THIS ACID ON THE METTLE OF CIVILIZATION NEVER ENTERS OUR SOCIETY. ORDER! "ORDER," I SAID! STOP HIM! [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] Heller: TAKE HIM OUT. HE'S HAD ANOTHER DISTURBANCE. Duprell: HE'S HAD ANOTHER DISTURBANCE. Dr. Vogel: I SEE. Mrs. Palinov: WHAT, UH, WHAT-WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? IT MEANS A SLIGHT DELAY. BUT, NOTHING, UH, DANGEROUS? NO, NOTHING DANGEROUS. WE'VE KEPT JENSEN OFF THE STREETS FOR OVER A WEEK. HIS PARTNERS MAY ALREADY BE SUSPICIOUS. I THINK THAT, UH, ANOTHER DAY COULDN'T HURT. IT ISN'T THAT HE DOESN'T-- I MEAN, HE DOES VERY MUCH WANT TO BE A CKS AGENT, RIGHT AWAY, TOO. ONE DAY SHOULD BE PLENTY ENOUGH TIME FOR YOU, RIGHT, DOCTOR? WE ARE DEALING WITH A HUMAN BODY, NOT A FINITE INSTRUMENT. ONE DAY, DR. VOGEL, ONE DAY. [ MUSIC ] THERE IS NO REASON FOR CONCERN, MRS. PALINOV. THE PROCEDURE IS ABSOLUTELY SAFE. [ MUSIC ] YOUR SON WILL NEVER FORGET WHAT YOU ARE DOING FOR HIM. RAYMOND! RAYMOND? Palinov: I'M ALMOST READY! RAYMOND, WHY ARE YOU STILL IN BED? DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS? I HAD ANOTHER ONE OF THESE DREAMS. INSTEAD OF PLAYING WITH YOUR WATCH, YOU SHOULD LOOK AT IT. YOU'RE LATE. THERE'S SOMETHIN' WRONG WITH THE BAND. IF YOU ASK ME, IT'S ALL THAT MEDIA FILTH YOU HAVE TO CONFISCATE. THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE ALL THESE DREAMS. I'VE ALWAYS SAID THERE'S A VERY THIN LINE BETWEEN MORAL SICKNESS AND-- [ COUGHING ] IF YOU'D JOINED THE ARMY LIKE YOUR FATHER, NONE OF THIS WOULD'VE HAPPENED. [ SIGH ] YOU WOULDN'T - YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO SEE ALL THIS MEDIA. IF I WAS IN THE ARMY, YOU'D BE HERE ALL BY YOURSELF. [ KETTLE WHISTLING ] COME ON-- YOUR TEA'S READY FOR YOU IN THE KITCHEN. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT. YOU KNOW THAT DR. VOGEL, THE DOCTOR WHO KNEW YOUR FATHER? HE-HE THINKS THE CKS SHOULD GIVE YOU A DIFFERENT JOB. I'M NOT IN THE CKS. THEN, YOU'RE BEING PROMOTED. PROMOTED? DR. VOGEL SAID HE WILL PROMOTE YOU TO THE CKS. NO, THAT'S NOT A PROMOTION. THE CKS IS AN ENTIRELY-- NO. YOU MUST'VE MISUNDERSTOOD. I WANT YOU TO WEAR YOUR GOOD SHOES. WE ARE GOING TO SEE HIM, RIGHT NOW. THEIR PROCEDURES TAKE YEARS. THERE'S PHYSICAL TRAINING, AND THERE'S BACKGROUND CHECKS, AND-- I'M SURE DR. VOGEL WILL SORT ALL THAT OUT. HE SAYS IT'S A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU. THIS MUST BE A MISTAKE. IT HAS TO BE. IT'S NOT A GOOD TIME. I MEAN, WITH ALL THE DREAMS I'VE BEEN HAVING AND BEING SICK. I DON'T THINK THE CKS IS GONNA WANT-- RAYMOND, IT WAS NOT EASY FOR ME TO GET YOU THIS APPOINTMENT. I'M HAPPY IN THE MEDIA FORCE. YOU'LL BE IMPORTANT, AND YOU'LL GO TO WORK IN A SUIT. I DON'T WANNA BE IN THE CKS. I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE ASKING ME TO BE SOMETHING I'M NOT. DO YOU WANT TO DISGRACE THE NAME OF YOUR FATHER? IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT? MR. PALINOV, I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO MEETING YOU. I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT THE MEDIA FORCE IS THE BACKBONE OF MAINTAINING OUR STANDARD OF LIFE IN THE HEMISPHERE. MEDIA OFFICERS LIKE YOURSELF HAVE ACTED HEROICALLY TO ENSURE OUR TRANQUILITY. UNFORTUNATELY, THE POISON FROM THE OUTSIDE HAS INCREASED TO DEMAND THAT WE HERE IN THE CKS JOIN WITH OUR BROTHERS IN THE DOMESTIC FORCES. MR. HELLER HAS INFORMED ME OF YOUR SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE IN THE GROUND LEVEL CAMPAIGNS. DO YOU THINK IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO SHOW MR. PALINOV THESE PHOTOGRAPHS, NOW? I WANT TO BE VERY SURE THAT MR. PALINOV COMPLETELY UNDERSTANDS HIS ASSIGNMENT. THE MAN YOU SEE IN THE PHOTOGRAPHS IS JENSEN. UNTIL LAST WEEK, ANY ATTEMPT TO LOCATE HIM WAS UNSUCCESSFUL. HIS OPERATION INVOLVED VIDEOTAPES, RECEIVERS, ILLEGAL ANTENNAS. BEFORE HIS ARREST, WE INTERCEPTED PLANS THAT WOULD'VE MADE HIM THE FIRST TO SUPPLY THE BLACK MARKET WITH DREAM-A-LIFE. DREAM-A-LIFE? IT'S A DANGEROUS NEW TYPE OF PERSONALITY ALTERING MEDIA. YES, WELL, NOBODY I KNOW USES ANY MEDIA. AN ADDICTION TO MEDIA ENCOMPASSES A MUCH WIDER SOCIAL SPECTRUM THAN ONE WOULD THINK, MRS. PALINOV. YOUR ASSIGNMENT, MR. PALINOV IS TO CONTACT JENSEN'S PARTNER IN MEGAVILLE AND CONFISCATE DREAM-A-LIFE BEFORE IT REACHES THE BLACK MARKET IN THE HEMISPHERE. MR. PALINOV? RAYMOND? THESE PICTURES-- WELL, IT'S-- YOU SEE, RAYMOND'S ALWAYS HATED VIOLENCE. IT ALMOST LOOKED LIKE HE ENJOYED KILLING. HE DID. MR. PALINOV, SURELY YOU NOTICE MANY SIMILARITIES BETWEEN JENSEN AND YOURSELF. SOMEONE WHO COULD IMPERSONATE THIS JENSEN, WITH YOUR BACKGROUND AND EXPERIENCE, WOULD BE AN INDISPENSABLE FACTOR IN OUR INVESTIGATIONS. WOULDN'T YOU AGREE? YES, SIR. UM, DR. VOGEL, YOU SAID-- YOU NEVER TOLD ME THAT RAYMOND WOULD BE INVOLVED WITH THAT. BUT, IF-- QUESTIONS, MR. PALINOV? YOU MAY SPEAK FREELY. I WAS ONLY WONDERING TO MYSELF-- WHAT IF I WAS TO BE RECOGNIZED AS-AS NOT BEING THE SUSPECT? INTELLIGENT OBSERVATION. THE PEOPLE OF MEGAVILLE HAVE PLASTIC SURGERY ON A REGULAR BASIS. I DOUBT ANYONE WILL QUESTION SOME MINOR DISCREPANCIES. MR. PALINOV, IT IS AN HONOR TO HAVE YOU WITH OUR ORGANIZATION. [ MUSIC ] [ GRUNTING ] AH, MR. JENSEN, HA-HA. NICE TO SEE YA, AGAIN. HAVEN'T SEEN YOU AROUND FOR A WHILE. IT'S BEEN, LIKE, TEN DAYS, HUH? HA-HA-HA. AH, THIS, UH, NOW, HA-HA-HA. YES? UH, MR. JENSEN, I MEAN WE'RE BOTH MEN OF THE WORLD AND ALL. YOU KNOW, I MEAN, UH, I'M IN BUSINESS, BUT, UH-- WHAT DO YOU WANT? ME-- NOTHIN'-- HA. WHAT THE HELL? I MEAN, IF IT WAS UP TO ME, PAY NOW, PAY LATER, YOU KNOW, LIKE THEY SAY. BUT, UH, THE MANAGER, HE, UH, YOU KNOW-- YOU NEED TO GET THE MANAGER'S FAT ASS OUT HERE, AND I'LL TALK TO HIM MYSELF. THAT REMINDS ME-- YOU GOT A COUPLE CALLS FROM MEGAVILLE-- NEWMAN AND TAYLOR. WHAT DO THEY WANT? I DON'T KNOW, BUT THEY CALLED A LOT. [ MUSIC ] Christine: LOOKIN' FOR ME? YOU GOT A GUN. I GOT A BOMB. I MEAN IT, JENSEN. EVEN BREATHE WRONG, AND THIS WHOLE BUILDING'S GONNA BLOW, AND WE'RE GONNA BE THE ONLY ONES IN HELL WITH THEIR OWN LUGGAGE. THIS HAS TO BE A MISTAKE. I'LL SAY IT IS. YOU PROMISED TO GET ME TO MEGAVILLE BY LAST WEEK. HOW CAN I GET YOU TO MEG-- I DON'T EVEN HAVE A MEGAVILLE PASSPORT. NOBODY DROPS LINE-UP ON ME, MOTHERFUCKER, NOBODY! I GAVE YOU EVERYTHING I HAD, AND YOU'RE GONNA GET ME TO MEGAVILLE. HERE'S YOUR MONEY. NOW, GET OUT. I WON'T TOUCH IT. A DEAL'S A DEAL. WE GOIN' TO MEGAVILLE, NOW? [ SIGH ] THEN, YOU HAVE A GUEST. [ MUSIC ] MR. DUPRELL, I HAD A DISTURBANCE. ALL RIGHT. YOU HAD A DISTURBANCE. NO, IT WAS-- IT WASN'T A DISTURBANCE. WELL, THIS TIME, IT HAPPENED IN FRONT OF SOMEONE WHO KNEW JENSEN, A WOMAN. FEMALE? YES. ANYWAY, SHE WAS THERE, AND I-I-I LOST-- UH... IT'S-IT'S HAPPENED A FEW TIMES SINCE I'VE BEEN ANESTHETIZED. ANESTHETIZED? UH, DURING A CHECK-UP A COUPLE DAYS AGO, AND NOW I HAVE THESE HEADACHES, AND I-I SEEM TO LOSE CONTROL, AND I-I DON'T WANNA ENDANGER YOUR MISSION, MR. DUPRELL, AND PERHAPS I SHOULD BE WITHDRAWN FROM THE ASSIGNMENT. DON'T BE CONCERNED ABOUT US, MR. PALINOV. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS YOUR OWN WELL-BEING. I'M SURE OUR DR. VOGEL CAN CORRECT YOUR DISTURBANCES. DR. VOGEL, OUR MR. PALINOV COMPLAINS THAT RECENTLY HE-- LOST CONTROL. HE LOST CONTROL. IT'S PROBABLY NOTHING SERIOUS, BUT I WANT YOU TO EXAMINE HIM. THAT'S EASILY TAKEN CARE OF. PLEASE, COME WITH ME. HE MENTIONED A FEMALE. A DESERTER-- SHE WAS WITH THE NATIONAL ARMY, EXPLOSIVES DETACHMENT. HOW LONG HAS SHE BEEN WITH JENSEN? COULDN'T HAVE BEEN LONG. I'LL ARRANGE TO HAVE HER INTERCEPTED, IMMEDIATELY. NOT RIGHT YET. [ MUSIC ] SHE STILL HERE? SHE NEVER LEFT. HMM. THIS PROGRAM IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY CHANNEL ONE MEGAVILLE TV, A SUBSIDIARY OF THE PALLADIAN NETWORKS CORPORATION. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IN THE STUDIO AND OUR WONDERFUL MEGAVILLE TV AUDIENCE. I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS POSSIBLE TO UNSCRAMBLE MEGAVILLE TV. IT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S LEGAL. WELCOME TO THE PRESIDENTIAL MANSION, WHERE PRESIDENT HUGHES WILL NOW PROVE TO US ONE MORE TIME THAT EVEN WITHOUT EXECUTIVE GOVERNING POWER-- WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF THE MEDIA SQUAD CAME IN? HA-- MEDIA SQUAD? THOSE BASTARDS WILL GET HOT RUNNING FOR A DIME. THEY'RE ALMOST AS BAD AS YOU. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PRESIDENT HUGHES. President Hughes: FELLOW CITIZENS, IT IS HARD FOR US IN MEGAVILLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT SOMETHING WE SO OFTEN TAKE FOR GRANTED, LIKE TURNING ON A TV SWITCH, ISN'T POSSIBLE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. IT IS EVEN ILLEGAL. IN MEGAVILLE, EVERY MAN AND WOMAN HAS EVERY OPPORTUNITY. NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE A CHANCE TO SUCCEED IN THE OCCUPATION OF OUR CHOICE, BUT WE ALSO HAVE THE TIME AND THE FREEDOM TO EXPLORE OTHER ASPECTS OF OURSELVES THROUGH ENTERTAINMENT AND TOP QUALITY MEDIA, SUCH AS THE PROGRAM YOU ARE WATCHING NOW. THIS IS THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE KREUGER DEVICE. BUT, TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST, GENTLEMEN, I WAS RETICENT ABOUT USING IT, WITHOUT FURTHER TESTING. HERE IS A TRANSMITTER THAT IS CONNECTED TO A SYRINGE IN THE CEREBRAL HEMISPHERE-- HUH. LET'S JUST CALL IT A REMOTE CONTROL FOR THE BRAIN. [ LAUGHTER ] THE DEVICE ALLOWS US TO CONTROL THE SUBJECT'S BEHAVIOR, THUS ELIMINATING THE PSYCHOTIC DISTURBANCE THAT SEEM TO ARISE FROM OUR EARLIER IMPLANT. MIRACULOUS AS THIS CONTRIVEMENT SOUNDS, I'D LIKE PROOF THAT IT ACTUALLY WORKS. FREEDOM, BUT WITH FREEDOM COMES RESPONSIBILITY, AND SINCE I VIEW ALL CITIZENS-- [ TOILET FLUSHING ] IT IS MY DUTY AS A FATHER TO ADDRESS THE GROWING PROBLEMS WE HAVE CONCERNING DREAM-A-LIFE. D.A.L. IS STILL FREELY AVAILABLE TO CONSUMERS, DESPITE REPORTS LINKING IT DIRECTLY TO OBSESSIVE AND ANTI-SOCIAL BEHAVIOR AND PERMANENT IDENTITY DISORDERS. NOW, FELLOW CITIZENS, I AM NOT IN SUPPORT OF GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE IN FREE ENTERPRISE. UNLIKE THE PURELY BIOLOGICAL TRANSPLANT I PERFORMED DURING THE CHECK-UP, THE KREUGER DEVICE IS NOTHING MORE THAN A SMALL RADIO THAT RECEIVES CONTROLLING SIGNALS TO STIMULATE THE BRAIN AT REGULAR INTERVALS. IT IS HARD FOR US IN MEGAVILLE TO UNDERSTAND-- HOW MUCH OF HIS THINKING PROCESS CAN BE ACTUALLY OBSERVED? USING THE BRAIN'S OWN ELECTRONIC IMPULSES, MY IMPROVEMENT TO THE KREUGER DEVICE TRANSMITS AUDIO AND VISUAL IMAGES AS THEY ARE BEING PROCESSED BY THE SUBJECT. I AM HEREBY URGING ALL CITIZENS, MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY, TO STOP USING DREAM-A-LIFE. WHAT'S GOING ON? I CAN'T MAKE OUT IT. SOMEONE IS ATTACKING THE PRESIDENT OF MEGAVILLE. THAT'S INSANE. DID THAT REALLY HAPPEN? WE ARE SORRY TO INTERRUPT THIS PROGRAM. PLEASE STAND BY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, A DRAMATIC INCIDENT HAS JUST SHOCKED MEGAVILLE. THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN ATTACKED DURING HIS WEEKLY TV ADDRESS. WE GO NOW LIVE OUTSIDE THE PRESIDENT'S MANSION. THIS IS BEN JOHNSON REPORTING LIVE FROM THE PRESIDENTIAL MANSION IN DOWNTOWN MEGAVILLE. BEHIND ME IS MR. VARGAS. HE WAS THE CARETAKER ON THE PROPERTY HERE, AND, WELL, WE BELIEVE, AT THIS POINT, HE ACTUALLY WITNESSED THIS TRAGIC EVENT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE JUST RECEIVED WORD THAT PRESIDENT HUGHES IS DEAD. ONCE AGAIN, PRESIDENT HUGHES IS DEAD. PRESENTLY, NO EXPLANATION HAS BEEN GIVEN FOR THE ASSASSINATION. POLITICAL MOTIVES HAVE BEEN RULED OUT. HA! UH, I HOPE I'M INTERRUPTIN'. THERE'S A PHONE CALL FOR YA, SIR. I THINK IT'S FROM MEGAVILLE. THIS HALLWAY SMELLS LIKE RAT PISS. [ COUGHING ] YEAH, WE GOT RATS, YOU KNOW, BUT WE'RE THE ONLY HOTEL WITH TELEPHONE IN THE CITY ANYMORE. AND THE RATS, THEY USE THE HALLWAY, BUT THEY DON'T USE THE TELEPHONE. [ LAUGHTER ] NOT UNLESS THEY'RE ANSWERING IT. WHAT? OH! OH, VERY FUNNY, MR. JENSEN. YES, SIR, YOU ARE A FUNNY MAN. YOU SHOULD BE ON MEGAVILLE TV. PISS OFF. WHAT THE HELL, DUDE? ARE WE TAKIN' THE STATION IDENTIFICATION OR WHAT? IF THIS IS SOME KIND OF CKS TAP OR TRAP, I'D LIKE TO GO ON RECORD THAT RIGHT NOW, I'M SITTIN' NAKED ON THE HEMISPHERE FLAG, AND I'M SCRATCHIN' MY BALLS WITH A COPY OF YOUR CONSTITUTION, OR YOUR CATECHISM, OR WHATEVER THE HELL YOU CALL IT. HELLO? HARK-- SOUNDS OF LIFE. JENSEN, WHERE YOU BEEN? I CALLED FOR DAYS. DON'T YOU LOVE ME ANYMORE? WHAT? WHAT'S BEEN GOIN' ON? WHERE WERE YA ALL THIS TIME? LOOK, I CAN'T HEAR YA-- I'M-- YOU SEE THE ASSASSINATION? YEAH-- YEAH, I-I SAW THAT. ALL RIGHT-- GET THE NEXT FLIGHT BACK TO MEGAVILLE. I GOTTA SEE YA AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. OKAY, NOW, I CAN HEAR YOU, BUT, UH, THERE'S, UH-- THIS GODDAMN SPHERE BULLSHIT-- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU STILL HEAR ME, BUT I'LL SEE YA TOMORROW. [ MUSIC ] SO, WE'RE FINALLY GETTING OUT OF HERE. DON'T EVEN THINK OF CUTTING OUT ON ME AGAIN, JENSEN. I KNOW A FEW THINGS ABOUT YOU. LIKE WHAT? LIKE I'M HARBORING A DESERTER? SO, YOU KNOW. I CAN'T TAKE YOU. THIS WAS A CIVIL WAR, GODDAMN IT! THEY'RE GONNA EXECUTE ME. THAT'S NOT FOR ME TO DETERMINE-- I'M SORRY. I WASN'T GONNA BLOW UP A VILLAGE FULL OF INNOCENT PEOPLE JUST BECAUSE HIGH COMMAND THOUGHT THEY WERE HIDING SOME ACTIVISTS. LOOK, I'VE GOT FRIENDS IN MEGAVILLE. I CAN GET YOU MORE MONEY-- FIVE HUNDRED, EVEN MORE. OUR AIRPLANE LEAVES IN 15 MINUTES... WITHOUT YOUR SUITCASE. MEGAVILLE AIRLINES FLIGHT 83 NOW ARRIVING GATE 4. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO NOW, JENSEN? THIS WILL GET YOU THROUGH SECURITY-- NO ONE EVER QUESTIONS A CKS BADGE. I'M IMPRESSED. I DON'T WANNA KNOW WHERE YOU FOUND THAT. MR. DUPRELL, HE'S TAKING THE DESERTER TO THE AIRPORT. MR. DUPRELL! INTERCEPT THEM. NO! IT'S YOUR DECISION, MR. DUPRELL, BUT IF YOU LET THE SUBJECT GET OUT OF OUR RANGE-- AS YOU SAID, IT IS MY DECISION. WELCOME TO MEGAVILLE AIRPORT. YOU ARE IN PARKING STRUCTURE SIX, LEVEL THREE. HAVE A NICE DAY. WE HAVE A LITTLE JOKE IN MEGAVILLE. HOW DO YOU SPOT A CKS SPY? HE'S THE GUY ON THE ROAD DOIN' THE SPEED LIMIT. PRETTY LAME, I KNOW, BUT IT SURE AS SHIT APPLIED TO PALINOV. TALK ABOUT SLOW. THERE'S A FUCKIN' BROADCAST TOWER LODGED BETWEEN HIS EARS, AND HE NEVER EVEN REACHED FOR AN ASPIRIN. WHEN HE DID, IT WAS TOO LATE. [ MUSIC ] [ MUSIC ] [ MUSIC ] [ MUSIC ] SO, DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE, AS FAR AS-- DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME. I'VE GOT FRIENDS HERE. OKAY. FORGET ABOUT IT. A DEAL'S A DEAL. IT'S YOUR MONEY. YEAH, WELL, YOU NEVER KNOW. YEAH, WELL, UNTIL YOU SEE YOUR FRIENDS, YOU KNOW? YOU'RE NOT HALF AS MUCH OF AN ASSHOLE AS I THOUGHT. AH, MEGAVILLE, LAND OF MEGA LISTS, MEGA BUCKS, MEGLAMANIA. LOOK WHO DUPRELL SENT TO STRIKE A DEAL WITH. HOW WAS THE LAND OF THE CAST IRON SPHINCTER? THE USUAL. MUST'VE BEEN BETTER THAN THAT. YOU WERE THERE TEN DAYS WITHOUT CALLIN' BACK. WAS IT TEN DAYS? I HAD TO GET A NEW GUY TO SATURDAY NIGHT THE PRESIDENT. [ SIGH ] RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE GODDAMN AUTO CAM. JANITOR WATCHIN' IT-- REAL SLOPPY WORK. OUR CLIENT HAS A WAY TO MAKE THE GUY IN THE MANSION FORGET WHAT HE SAW. BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE WAY TO, HOW SHOULD WE SAY, TRAMBLE UP THE CONSEQUENCE. NOW THAT WE HAVE CORPORATE BACKING, UH, WELL, I FEEL AS THOUGH I DESERVE AN EXECUTIVE POSITION. LET ME THE EXECUTING, IF YOU FOLLOW MY DRIFT. I DON'T KNOW. WHAT? THE GUY WHO ONCE WALKED INTO A HOUSE, SHOT THE GUY, HIS WIFE, AND TWO KIDS NOW GIVES ME "I DON'T KNOW?" WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO YOU OUT THERE? DID YOU FALL IN LOVE? I THOUGHT WE HAD THIS BIG PLAN TO INTRODUCE DREAM-A-LIFE TO THE SPHERE? THE DISTRIBUTION OF D.A.L. IS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE. OUR CLIENTS ARE TOO SCATTERED. THE CKS CRACKDOWNS ARE TOO FREQUENT. WE'D LOSE EVERYTHING BEFORE WE HAD A CONNECTION WITH ENOUGH PULL TO LOOP US AROUND THE ADMINISTRATION. THE DEMAND FOR MEDIA IS GROWING. THE SPHERE IS READY FOR DREAM-A-LIFE. THIS IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT-- IDYLLIC PENISITUDE. EVERY COMPANY IN TOWN HAS TO INVADE THE CELESTIAL WOMB AS A TESTIMONY TO THEIR CORPORATE SWORDSMANSHIP. MEANWHILE, PALLADIAN LAUNCHES A TAKEOVER AND SWALLOWS UP THE COMPANY. HMM-- INCLUDING THE NEWLY ERECTED GLASS DICKS. YOU KNOW, I THINK THEY SHOULDA BUILT BIG GLASS HANDS ON THE BOTTOMS OF THESE THINGS. BUT, GOD BLESS MEGAVILLE. CLEAN UP AFTER THAT MURDER. MAKE SURE THAT JANITOR DON'T TALK. [ MUSIC ] YES. MR. DUPRELL, I JUST MET NEWMAN. VERY GOOD. MAINTAIN JENSEN'S ALLIANCE. WHEN THIS ASSIGNMENT IS OVER, I'D LIKE TO MEET THIS JENSEN AND PERSONALLY SPIT IN HIS FACE. I WOULD PREFER IT IF YOU COULD RESTRAIN YOUR EMOTIONS DURING THIS MISSION, MR. PALINOV. HE KILLED TWO SLEEPING CHILDREN. WHAT ABOUT THE FEMALE TRAITOR? SHE WAS GONE WHEN I GOT BACK TO THE HOTEL. I SEE. CARRY ON. HE'S LYING ABOUT THE FEMALE. THAT'S NOT WHAT I WOULD CALL HAVING HIM STABILIZED. YOU REALIZE, DR. VOGEL, THAT PALINOV IS SLIPPING. OUR PLANS FOR DREAM-A-LIFE ARE IN STALEMATE UNTIL WE CAN BRIEF HIM ON OUR FULL INTENTIONS. Taylor: HOW YA DOIN'? LET'S TALK, HUH? [ TIRES SQUEALING ] [ CAR HONKING ] [ MUSIC ] [ MUSIC ] HA! WHEW! BEEN A LITTLE PROBLEM GETTING A HOLD OF YOU. HATE TO THINK YOU WOULD JUST DISAPPEAR WITH MY MONEY. HATE TO THINK THAT. DON'T YOU HATE TO THINK THAT? HE HATES TO THINK THAT, TOO. OH, YEAH? WELL, TELL HIM TO STOP THINKIN' SO MUCH. AH. HA-HA-HA. I LIKE YOU. YOU'RE FUNNY. I LIKE YOU, AND YOU'RE FUNNY. [ SIGH ] MAYBE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. UH, I REALLY WANT A PART OF THE DREAM-A-LIFE DEAL. SO, I'M GONNA GIVE YOU, UM... ANOTHER 24 HOURS. IF YOU WANNA LIVE LONGER, GET ME THE DEAL, OKAY? WELCOME TO NEW HORIZON MOTEL. WE HOPE YOU HAVE A PLEASANT STAY WITH US. ALL OUR ROOMS FEATURE MAGNIFYING MAKEUP MIRRORS, ADJUSTABLE KING SIZE BEDS, AND ELECTRIC BLANKETS IN CASE YOU WANT TO TURN THAT AIR CONDITIONING UP ALL THE WAY. song: IF YOU HAVE TO TAKE A REST AND YOU WANT THE VERY BEST NEW HORIZON HELPS THE BEST TO GET THE PROBLEM OFF YOUR CHEST AND HE CAME TO THE MASTER, AND HE SAID, "YOU HAVE GIVEN ME "FIVE TALENTS OF GOLD, AND "I HAVE MADE FIVE TALENTS MORE."

LOOKS LIKE PSYCHO STIMULATION INTERFERENCE, SIMILAR TO OUR EXPERIMENT. THERE ISN'T ANYTHING I CAN DO. [ MUSIC ] [ GUNSHOTS ] IT WOULD SEEM THIS EXPERIMENT HAS COME TO A MOST UNFORTUNATE CONCLUSION. HELLER! SIR. SEND A SPECIAL OPERATIVE TO MEGAVILLE AND HAVE HIM INTERCEPTED. MR. DUPRELL, I ADVISE AGAINST TERMINATING THIS PROJECT. REGARDLESS OF THE GRAPHIC VIOLENCE IN THESE SCENES, JOURNALISTIC RESPONSIBILITY NECESSITATES THAT WE INFORM OUR AUDIENCE REPEATEDLY OF THIS HISTORICAL EVENT, RECORDED COLD AND ACCURATE BY AN AUTO CAM PROGRAMMED TO KEEP ITS LENS ON THE PRESIDENT'S FACE. [ KNOCKING ] TO WIN CASH ON JACKPOT BINGO, YOU MUST HAVE BLACKOUT BINGO. THAT MEANS EVERY NUMBER ON YOUR CARD HAS TO HAVE BEEN CALLED DURING TODAY'S GAME, AND YOUR CARD SHOULD LOOK LIKE THIS. [ KNOCKING ] ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR CARD COMPLETELY BLACKED OUT, IF YOU ARE THE FIRST PERSON TO CALL IN WITH-- SHIT. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? I'M OKAY. YOU'RE BLEEDING OUT OF YOUR EARS. IT'S-- NO, I'M-- I HAVE A HEADACHE. I'VE SEEN YOUR HEADACHES BEFORE. GET-GET OUT. I'M ONLY TRYING TO HELP. I KNOW, AND I APPRECIATE THAT, BUT, UH, YOU-YOU DON'T WANT TO. YOU DON'T-- YOU CAN'T ASSOCIATE YOURSELF WITH ME, RIGHT NOW. YEAH, OKAY-- FINE. I'LL JUST BE GOING, THEN. WHAT IS IT? NOTHING. IT'S JUST THAT YOU SHOULDN'T BE ALONE. NOBODY SHOULD. GO ON-- GET OUTTA HERE. [ MUSIC ] AND HOW ARE WE TO KNOW IF THE KREUGER DEVICE IS EVEN OPERATIONAL? THAT'S JUST THE POINT. WE DON'T. BUT, IF WE DISCHARGE HIM NOW, THE EXPERIMENT WILL END, NOT JUST WITH PALINOV, BUT FOR ALL TIME. THIS IS BEN JOHNSON REPORTING LIVE, ONCE AGAIN, FROM THE PRESIDENTIAL MANSION. WITH ME IS MR. VARGAS, WHO'S THE CARETAKER ON THE PROPERTY HERE AND ACTUALLY WITNESSED THIS TRAGIC EVENT. AS YOU CAN SEE, MR. VARGAS IS ON THE DREAM-A-LIFE THERAPY FOR SHOCK DISORDER, A THERAPY ACTUALLY DEVELOPED BY DR. SKUTNIK. MR. VARGAS, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE ASSASSINATION... OF THE PRESIDENT? Dr. Skutnik: AS YOU CAN SEE, BEN, MR. VARGAS IS STILL SUFFERING TREMENDOUS EMOTIONAL ANXIETY FROM THE SHOCK. YOU USE DREAM-A-LIFE IN YOUR THERAPY, DOCTOR. AND, WELL, WASN'T IT PRESIDENT HUGHES WHO WAS ACTUALLY TRYING TO WARN THE MEGAVILLE VIEWING AUDIENCE ABOUT DREAM-A-LIFE WHEN HE WAS KILLED? I DON'T THINK HE WAS WARNING PEOPLE AGAINST DREAM-A-LIFE PER SE. BUT, WHAT THE LATE PRESIDENT RATHER WAS DOING, WAS CAUTIONING CONSUMERS THEY MUST FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS ON THE D.A.L. PACKAGE. THANK YOU, DOCTOR. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK AFTER THESE MESSAGES. [ TELEPHONE RINGING ] MR. DUPRELL? MR. DUPRELL, IT'S ME. YES, MR. PALINOV. SIR, I'M CONVINCED THAT THE PRESIDENT'S MURDER'S GOT SOMETHING TO DO WITH DREAM-A-LIFE. AND NEWMAN? I THINK HE'S TIED TO THE ASSASSINATION, AS WELL, SIR, BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW OR WHY. I WANT TO KNOW NEWMAN'S PLANS FOR DREAM-A-LIFE. WELL, HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY. BUT, IF I CAN FIND OUT WHAT HIS CONNECTION IS TO THE ASSASSINATION-- YOU ARE NOT TO CONCERN YOURSELF WITH MEGAVILLE'S INTERNAL PROBLEMS. GO BACK TO MR. NEWMAN, IMMEDIATELY. I'M SORRY, SIR. I-I CAN'T DO THAT UNTIL I KNOW WHAT HE'S TRYING TO COVER UP. YOU CAN TELL HE WASN'T THE SAME. JENSEN NEVER SAT THIS STILL UNLESS HE WAS LINING UP CROSSHAIRS. I FIGURED I'D HAVE TO STAY ON TOP OF HIM. [ LAUGHTER ] MAYBE THAT JANITOR WAS TRAUMATIZED INTO A STATE OF CATATONIC BLISS. IN THAT CASE, WHY CLEAN UP AFTER HIM? I THINK WE'D BOTH FEEL BETTER, IF YOU JUST DID YOUR JOB, RIGHT NOW. INCREASING THE OUTPUT SHOULD CREATE ENOUGH OF AN OVERLOAD TO MELT THE SUPERFICIAL NERVES AND RESTORE THE MONITORING UNIT. WON'T THAT BE DANGEROUS? I HARDLY RECOMMEND THAT ANYONE ELECTS TO HAVE THE TOP OF THEIR BRAIN BURNED AWAY. HIGHER. MOVE THAT DIAL HIGHER. [ MUMBLING ] [ MUSIC ] MMM. WE'RE ALREADY AT TWICE THE SAFE MAXIMUM. INCREASE THE OUTPUT. NO. ANOTHER INCREASE COULD LITERALLY BLOW UP HIS BRAIN. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO FIND YOURSELF THE SUBJECT OF MY EXPERIMENT, YOU WILL GET THAT CRETAN UNDER CONTROL. IT'S NOT THE LEVEL OF OUTPUT. IT'S THE SUBJECT HIMSELF. HE MIGHT BE LOSING HIS EGO TO JENSEN. MR. DUPRELL, THE KREUGER DEVICE AND MONITORING UNIT ARE FUNCTIONING, AGAIN. [ EXPLOSIONS ] HEAVY ARTILLERY FIRE. THEY WILL DIE BRAVE MEN. COWARDS! WHERE IS HE GOING? WHAT IS HE DOING THERE? HEY, I'M NOT GONNA HURT YA. I JUST WANNA FIND OUT ABOUT THE ASSASSINATION. GIVE THAT BACK. [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] I AM EMPEROR OF THE WORLD. I'M SUPPOSED TO KILL YOU! GODDAMMIT! I-- GOD, YOU SAW THE PRESIDENT MURDERED. YOU WERE STANDING RIGHT THERE! YOU'RE THE ONLY WITNESS. I'M A JANITOR. YOU GOTTA TELL THE TRUTH. JUST, UH, GIVE ME A MINUTE OF PEACE TO FINISH MY BATTLE. I'M-I'M UNDERGOING A VERY DELICATE TREATMENT. THERE'S ANOTHER TREATMENT WAITING FOR YOU, IF YOU DON'T HURRY UP. OH, GOD-- NO, YOU CAN'T. UGH! GOD! NO EXCUSES, JENSEN. MR. PALINOV, CALM DOWN. EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT. I FEEL - I FEEL IT'S UP TO THE CKS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE INVESTIGATION. THE CKS HAS NO JURISDICTION TO INVESTIGATE A MURDER IN MEGAVILLE. BESIDES, WE SENT YOU THERE FOR A VERY DIFFERENT PURPOSE. DO YOU HAVE JURISDICTION FOR THAT? I SEE THAT YOUR VISIT TO MEGAVILLE HAS ALREADY AFFECTED YOUR SENSE OF HONOR. IF YOU PERSIST IN DELAYING YOUR ASSIGNED MISSION-- TELL ME WHAT MY ASSIGNED MISSION IS! YOUR INFORMATION IS ON A NEED TO KNOW BASIS. IF YOU DON'T COOPERATE, I SHALL BRING YOU BEFORE THE ADMINISTRATION ON CHARGES OF HIGH TREASON! I'D BE VERY SURPRISED IF ANY OF THIS HAS EVER BEEN APPROVED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. I HAVE SOMEONE YOU SHOULD TALK WITH. [ MUSIC ] RAYMOND? MOTHER? RAYMOND, I AM SO DISAPPOINTED. I AM SO VERY DISAPPOINTED. OH, RAYMOND, I WAS SO PROUD OF YOU. WHAT HAPPENED? IS IT BECAUSE I WANTED THIS FOR YOU? IS THIS WHY YOU-- NO, IT'S-IT'S MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT. I-I'LL TELL YOU WHEN I FIND OUT. FIND OUT WHAT? WHAT-WHAT DO YOU NEED TO FIND OUT? J-JUST ASK-- ASK ME. OR, DON'T YOU TRUST ME? IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF TRUST. OF COURSE, I TRUST YOU. HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT I HAVE TO UNDERSTAND FOR MYSELF? NO, RAYMOND-- PLEASE? NO, YOU-YOU DON'T WANNA UNDERSTAND. WHAT DO YOU MEAN I DON'T WANT TO? YOU WOULD BE-- MR. PALINOV, YOUR MOTHER MISSES YOU VERY MUCH. I KNOW-- I-I'M SORRY, SIR. I KNOW. YOU JUST WANNA COME BACK HOME. NO, THERE-THERE'S SOMETHING VERY WRONG WITH WHAT I'M DOING IN MEGAVILLE. I'M SUPPOSED TO BE AN OFFICER OF THE LAW. MR. DUPRELL, I NEED YOUR HELP. CERTAINLY. AS SOON AS YOU SET UP A TRANSACTION WITH NEWMAN. TELL HIM YOU HAVE AN EXCLUSIVE CUSTOMER FOR DREAM-A-LIFE IN THE HEMISPHERE. I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED IN YOU, KIDDO, VERY, VERY DISAPPOINTED. STOP BEING SO FUCKIN' PATERNAL. ALL RIGHT. I JUST DON'T KNOW, KIDDO. YOU SEEM TO BE A DIFFERENT PERSON EVERY FIVE MINUTES. LET'S JUST DEAL DREAM-A-LIFE. I GOT SOME MAJOR PLAYERS BACK IN THE SPHERE. THEY WANT EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT. THE ONLY PEOPLE BACK IN THE SPHERE WHO CAN AFFORD EVERYTHING WE GOT IS THE FUCKIN' ADMINISTRATION. WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU? YOU CAN'T SPOT A CKS TRAP THIS OBVIOUS? PFFT. HA-HA-HA. MOVE. I GOT GOOD NEWS FOR YA. UH-HUH. NEWMAN DROPPED LINEUP ON THE DEAL. D.A.L. IS ALL YOURS. JUST LIKE THAT? JUST LIKE THAT. YOU GIVE YOURSELF A LOT OF CREDIT TO THINK YOU CAN OUTSMART SOMEONE LIKE ME. MAYBE SHE'LL BELIEVE YOU. SO, WHAT-- IS THIS WHACKED OUT LETTER GIRL SUPPOSED TO AMUSE ME? LET ME PUT THIS IN A WAY EVEN YOU CAN UNDERSTAND. IF YOU FUCK WITH ME, SHE'S DEAD. IT'D BE A SHAME TO LET SOMETHIN' LIKE THIS GO TO WASTE. THEN AGAIN, SHE WAS NEVER THAT ALIVE WITH ME ANYWAY. [ GRUNTING ] [ MUSIC ] [ MUSIC ] YOU ENJOYED THAT, YOU BASTARD, DIDN'T YOU? AT LEAST I GOT YOU OUTTA THERE. YEAH, MAYBE I WAS BETTER OFF BACK THERE WITH YOUR PALS. WELL, YOU WANNA GO BACK? WHAT THE HELL IS IT WITH YOU ANYWAY? WITH ME? YEAH, IT'S LIKE YOU'RE NOT-- I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. IT'S GOT NOTHIN' TO DO WITH YOU, ALL RIGHT? WHAT THE HELL IS IT? I'M NOT WHO I THINK YOU AM. MY NAME IS RAYMOND PALINOV. I'M ONLY IMPERSONATING JENSEN. OF ALL THE SHIT. NO, GODDAMN IT-- THE CKS, THEY MADE ME AN OPERATIVE. I DIDN'T MEAN TO INVOLVE YOU, AND I'M SORRY. IF YOU'RE WITH THE CKS, THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU ARREST ME BACK AT THE SPHERE? I WASN'T AFTER YOU. THE CKS IS AFTER EVERYONE. YOU WATCHDOGS JUST CAN'T WAIT FOR SOMEONE TO FALL OUT OF LINE. PROTECTIVE SUPERVISION-- PLAIN AND SIMPLE, IT'S STATE TERRORISM. IS THAT SOMETHING YOU LEARNED FROM YOUR MEGAVILLE FRIENDS? I DON'T NEED ANYBODY TO TELL ME THAT THE WORLD WOULD BE A BETTER PLACE WITHOUT THE CKS. LIKE IT IS MEGAVILLE-- WHAT IS SO GODDAMN PERFECT ABOUT THIS PLACE? NO, NOT LIKE MEGAVILLE AND MAYBE NOT PERFECT, EITHER, BUT IT COULD BE JUST A LITTLE BETTER. A PERPETUAL DREAMER YOU ARE. [ TIRES SQUEALING ] WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? SOMEBODY WAS GONNA SURPRISE ME. [ TIRES SQUEALING ] [ MUSIC ] YOU SURE DO KNOW YOUR WAY AROUND TOWN, CONSIDERING YOU'VE ONLY BEEN HERE A COUPLE OF DAYS. [ PHONE RINGING ] HELLO. MR. NEWMAN, IT'S MR. PALLADIAN FOR YOU. PLEASE HOLD. Palladian: NEWMAN, FORGET JENSEN FOR A MOMENT. WE HAVE A LITTLE PROBLEM WITH OUR PLASTIC SURGEON. WELL, LITTLE PROBLEMS ARE MY SPECIALTY. THE DOCTOR'S GETTING TO BE VERY UNREASONABLE. HE'S TRYING TO BLACKMAIL ME. LISTEN, CAN YOU PAY HIM A HOUSE CALL AND APOLOGIZE FOR ME? I'M ALREADY THERE. [ KNOCKING ] WHERE'S PALLADIAN? TAKE IT EASY, DR. SKUTNIK. YOU MIGHT HURT YOURSELF. AND WHY NOT? IT'D SAVE YOU THE TROUBLE, RIGHT? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? PUT YOUR HANDS UP-- UP! YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. HA-HA. WHY DID YOU COME INSTEAD OF PALLADIAN? HE'S A BUSY MAN. HE SAID HE'LL STOP BY LATER, IF HE COULD. AM I SUPPOSED TO WAIT HERE? I'M GONNA HAVE TO FIND OUT BY MYSELF. AHEM. LOOK, DR. SKUTNIK, I'M NOT GONNA TOUCH YOU, BUT MY ARMS ARE GETTING TIRED UP HERE. CAN I PUT THEM DOWN? PUT 'EM ON. NOT MY SIZE. [ GUNSHOT ] WOULDN'T BE TOO SPORTING AT THIS RANGE. HA-HA. SO, I'LL GET WITH YOU A LITTLE LATER. DR. SKUTNIK! DR. SKUTNIK-- DR. SKUTNIK? STAND BACK! I SAID, "STAND BACK!" [ PHONE RINGING ] YEAH. TAKING A TRIP, MR. PALINOV? HOW DO YOU KNOW I'M IN THIS CAR? WE KNOW MUCH MORE THAN THAT. MR. PALINOV, I'M GIVING YOU ONE LAST CHANCE TO SAVE YOURSELF. GET OUT OF YOUR... SITUATION AND SETTLE THE DEAL WITH NEWMAN. GIVE HIM WHATEVER HE WANTS. YEAH, WELL, NEWMAN ISN'T INTERESTED IN DREAM-A-LIFE, AND HE WON'T MAKE ANY DEALS WITH ME. THEN, YOU'LL HAVE TO MAKE IT IRRESISTIBLE. TELL HIM THE CKS WILL BUY DREAM-A-LIFE. MR. PALINOV? MR. PALINOV, ANSWER ME. NEWMAN WON'T GO FOR CKS INVOLVEMENT. WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED DURING MY EXAMINATION WITH DR. VOGEL? FIRST, MAKE CONTACT WITH NEWMAN. HE'LL MAKE THE DEAL. EVERYBODY IN MEGAVILLE THINKS THE CKS IS CORRUPT. YEAH, I'M BEGINNING TO SEE WHY. [ DIAL TONE ] MR.-- MR.-- HOLD ON. MR. DUPRELL! PALINOV WILL REALIZE THE CONSEQUENCES OF BETRAYING HIS GOVERNMENT! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? STOP IT-- STOP IT! MRS. PALINOV! GET-GET HER UNDER SEDATION. HERE-- PLEASE? NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. MR. DUPRELL, YOU SAID YOU NEEDED MY SON ONLY A FEW DAYS. THAT BASTARD IS JEOPARDIZING ADMINISTRATIVE SECURITY! YOU LIED, MR. DUPRELL! YOU SAID MY SON WOULDN'T EVEN REMEMBER ANY OF THIS. OH! GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT, EVERYONE. [ TIRES SQUEALING ] [ PHONE RINGING ] WHY ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME? DR. SKUTNIK, I NEED SOME ANSWERS. YOU WANT SOME ANSWERS? WELL, I WANT SOME ANSWERS. WHY HAS PALLADIAN SENT ALL YOU GUYS AFTER ME? THEY'RE NOT AFTER YOU. IT'S GOT SOMETHIN' TO DO WITH NEWMAN, BUT I REALLY DON'T KNOW. YOU CAN'T FOOL ME. CAN DREAM-A-LIFE BE PUT INSIDE THE BRAIN? HOW WOULD-- I-- YOU DEVELOPED D.A.L. IS IT POSSIBLE TO IMPLANT IT SO SOMEONE DOESN'T KNOW HE HAS IT? WHY WOULD ANYBODY WANNA DO THAT? I MEAN, EVERYBODY LOVES DREAM-A-LIFE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO FORCE A FANTASY LIFE ON PEOPLE. WHAT IF IT'S NOT A FANTASY? WHAT IF SOMEONE WANTS TO MAKE YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE SOMEONE ELSE, WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING IT'S BEING DONE? WELL, SURE, IT'S POSSIBLE. WELL, YES. OF COURSE, IT'S POSSIBLE GIVEN A CERTAIN SET OF-- WAIT A MINUTE. OH, NO-NO-NO-NO. YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET ME. PALLADIAN'S TRYING TO GET RID OF ME! I DON'T WORK FOR PALLADIAN! HE WANTS D.A.L. ALL FOR HIMSELF! IF IT WASN'T FOR ME, THAT WITNESS WOULD'VE EXPOSED HIM! THAT WITNESS ISN'T GONNA EXPOSE ANYBODY NOW, WITH OR WITHOUT DREAM-A-LIFE. THE ONLY GREAT THING YOU'VE DONE IS ALLOW PALLADIAN TO GET AWAY WITH MURDERING THE PRESIDENT! GET IN THE CAR! GET IN! PUT IT AROUND YOUR WRIST. GO ON-- DO AS I SAY. PUT THE OTHER ONE ON THE STEERING WHEEL. DREAM-A-LIFE IS A GREAT GIFT FOR MANKIND. [ TIRES SQUEALING ] [ PHONE RINGING ] AH. [ PHONE RINGING ] [ CRYING ] HE'S STILL NOT ANSWERING. WILL SOMEONE STOP THAT WOMAN'S INCESSANT HOWLING? I FEEL AS IF I'M INSIDE A DAMN SLAUGHTERHOUSE. WE'LL NEED HER PRESENCE HERE WHEN WE REESTABLISH COMMUNICATION WITH THE SUBJECT. DO YOU SERIOUSLY THINK THAT WILL HAPPEN? INCREASE THE OUTPUT TO MAXIMUM. HELLER, INCREASE THE OUTPUT. HELLER, DON'T. HELLER, INCREASE THE OUTPUT. MR. HELLER, YOU ARE AWARE OF THE PUNISHMENT FOR DISOBEYING A DIRECT ORDER. WE CAN CONTACT THE SUBJECT. DON'T TREAT ME LIKE A FOOL, DOCTOR. HE WON'T ANSWER THE PHONE. WE CAN'T MAKE HIM FOLLOW ANY OF OUR ORDERS. THAT ELECTRONIC PLACEBO OF YOURS COULD DO ONLY TWO THINGS. IT CAN LET US WATCH HIM DISOBEY US, OR IT CAN KILL HIM. WE CAN TALK TO HIM THROUGH THE KREUGER DEVICE. THROUGH AN AUDITORY SENSOR IN THE BRAIN, WE CAN COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY TO PALINOV. WHY DIDN'T WE USE THAT BEFORE? BECAUSE IT WILL GRADUALLY STOP THE FLOW OF OXYGEN TO HIS BRAIN. HMM. GIVE ME THAT! OH, NO, MR. DUPRELL. IF THIS IS GOING TO WORK AT ALL, HE MUST NOT BE OVERLY INTIMIDATED. MRS. PALINOV? YOUR SON WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK WITH YOU. RAYMOND? RAYMOND? RAYMOND, IT'S ME. RAYMOND, TALK TO ME. YES, MOM. I'M ALMOST READY. RAYMOND, PLEASE TALK TO ME. RAYMOND, YOU HAVE TO-- MOTHER? YES. OH, RAYMOND, I WAS SO WORRIED ABOUT YOU. I'M SO SORRY IF I HURT YOU, RAYMOND. YOU HAVE TO COME HOME. THEY-THEY TELL ME THAT THEY'RE BRINGING YOU HOME SOON, AND YOU'LL GET BETTER. GODDAMN, DUPRELL, WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' TO MY HEAD? THERE'S NO CAUSE FOR ALARM, MR. PALINOV. THERE IS A DEVICE IN YOUR BRAIN THAT ENABLES ME TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOU SINCE YOU INSIST ON NOT ANSWERING THE PHONE. YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO DO THIS. IF YOU COOPERATE, MR. PALINOV, YOU WILL BE BACK IN THE HEMISPHERE BY TOMORROW EVENING. WILL YOU COOPERATE? COOP-- FIRST, YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU DID TO MY HEAD-- EVERYTHING! I DON'T THINK YOU'RE IN ANY POSITION TO BARGAIN. YOU PUT SOME KIND OF DREAM-A-LIFE INSIDE ME, DIDN'T YOU? OUR DR. VOGEL REFERS TO IT MORE SIMPLY AS A MEMORY IMPLANT. I-I KNEW IT-- I KNEW IT! I KNEW-- YOU PUT PART OF JENSEN INSIDE MY BRAIN! I KNEW IT! GODDAMN YOU, DUPRELL! I KNEW IT! YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING. YOU CAN STOP NOW. HE'S DISABLED THE KREUGER DEVICE, AGAIN. THAT'S EASILY CORRECTED. NO, THIS WON'T WORK AS LONG AS THE KREUGER DEVICE IS OUT. HE'LL SMASH HIS HEAD OPEN BEFORE HE'LL GIVE IN. WE HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER WAY. WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT NEWMAN. WHY DON'T WE MAKE THE DEAL WITH HIM DIRECTLY? THAT'S RIDICULOUS. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, SIR, WHY DID YOU THINK PALINOV COULD'VE DONE IT? NO WONDER THE CKS MADE PALINOV THE SACRIFICIAL LAMB. DREAM-A-LIFE WAS ONE HELL OF A GOLDEN EGG. YOU ALMOST HAD TO FEEL SORRY FOR THE GOOSE THAT LAID IT AND THEN HAD IT STOLEN OUT FROM UNDER HIM. [ HONKING ] THE PROBLEM IS, WITH COMPASSION, IT'S NO SUBSTITUTE FOR BALLS. WAITIN' FOR ME? DON'T GO AWAY. [ PHONE RINGING ] HELLO. MR., UH, NEWMAN, YOU DON'T KNOW ME, BUT I'M OFFICER HELLER WITH THE CKS. HA-- WHAT IS THIS-- A JOKE OR SOMETHING? NO, IT ISN'T. I AM THE PERSONAL SECRETARY TO MR. DUPRELL, DIRECTOR OF OUR AGENCY. WHAT HAPPENED? YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME. THEY IMPLANTED PART OF JENSEN'S MEMORY INTO MY BRAIN. [ MUSIC ] YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE. I'VE BEEN TO WORSE PLACES. YOU HAVE FRIENDS IN MEGAVILLE-- YOU SHOULD BE WITH YOUR FRIENDS, RIGHT NOW. JUST FORGET ABOUT MY FRIENDS. IT WASN'T ALL THAT. THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT NOW. THINGS WITH EVERYTHING ARE DIFFERENT. I GOTTA GO BACK. BACK TO MEGAVILLE? HEMISPHERE. THE CKS WILL NEVER LET YOU OUT OF THERE ALIVE. I DON'T CARE. IF I CAN TAKE ONE OF 'EM WITH ME, IF I CAN BREAK THAT NEAT LITTLE CHAIN, IT'LL MAKE A DIFFERENCE. WHO'S A PERPETUAL DREAMER, NOW? YOU CAN'T FIGHT THESE PEOPLE. I KNOW-- THAT'S WHY I LEFT THE FUCKIN' ARMY. WELL, THAT DID A LOT OF GOOD, RIGHT? I MEAN, YOU REALLY THINK YOU SAVED THAT VILLAGE BY RUNNING AWAY? COME ON-- THEY BLEW THE SHIT OUT OF THOSE PEOPLE BEFORE YOU COULD EVEN CHANGE YOUR CLOTHES. WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO? I DON'T KNOW. RUN AWAY TO MEGAVILLE. PRETEND YOU MADE THE LEAST BIT OF DIFFERENCE. SAVE YOUR PINK LITTLE ASS. LET THE REST OF THE WORLD GO TO HELL. I MEAN-- OH, I'M SORRY. AND ACCEPT IT. NOW, HOW I GONNA KNOW THIS IS NOT A SETUP? YOU ARE UNSATISFIED WITH OUR OFFER. I SUPPOSE I SHOULD TRY MR. PALLADIAN DIRECTLY. NO-NO, THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY. MR. PALLADIAN DIRECTLY-- HA. [ YAWNING ] I HOPE I'M INTERRUPTING, HUH? TOUCH HER AND I'LL KILL YOU. [ GRUNTING ] YOU SON OF A BITCH! OH-- OH! WHOA-- WHOA-- WHOA-- WHOA! WHY DON'T YOU AND I GO TALK A LITTLE BUSINESS WHILE MY SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT PLAYS WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND? [ LAUGHTER ] [ SIGH ] [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, TOP OF THE MORNING, BOYS. GLAD TO MEET YOU, MR. NEWMAN. THE NAME IS TAYLOR. YOUR, UH, JUNIOR PARTNER THERE DOUBLE CROSSED ME. SO, UH, I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU AND I-- I-I MEAN, I WOULD LOVE TO HELP SET UP D.A.L. IN THE SPHERE. I MEAN, WITH MY CONNECTIONS. HA-HA-HA. GOTTA WATCH WHAT YOU PICK UP IN A PLACE LIKE THIS. SOME OF IT'S LIKELY TO OOZE. IT'S TWO AGAINST ONE, MR. NEWMAN-- YOU CAN'T WIN. I WON'T NEED YOU TO SET UP D.A.L., BUT I COULD USE THE HELP OF YOUR FRIEND HERE. HOW WOULD YOU LIKE A CAREER CHANGE? [ LAUGHTER ] THERE'S JUST NO LOYALTY LEFT IN THIS WORLD. COME ON, KID-- WE GOT WORK, BIG STUFF, D.A.L. DISTRIBUTION. I THOUGHT THAT WASN'T POSSIBLE. NOTHING EVER IS. WHERE THERE'S A WILL... SO THEY SAY. EXCUSE MY LAPSE INTO PLATITUDINAL EXTRAPOLATION. WHY THE CHANGE? YOU DO A COUPLE OF JOBS FOR ME-- I'LL SELL DREAM-A-LIFE TO MY GRANDMOTHER. BUT FIRST, WE GOTTA GET YOU BETTER. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "BETTER?" RUMOR HAS IT THEY FUCKED WITH YOUR BRAINS A LITTLE. GOTTA GET YOU BACK TO MEGAVILLE AND FIX YOU UP. YOU KNOW DUPRELL? I KNOW A GOOD FUCKIN' DEAL-- HA. LOOK, WE'RE SET UP TO SELL DREAM-A-LIFE IN THE SPHERE WITH INSURANCE BY THE CKS. CKS WANTS TO RUN THE BLACK MARKET? THAT FITS RIGHT IN. AND THAT'S WHERE WE FIT IN, JENSEN. I'M NOT JENSEN-- I'M PALINOV. OH, WHATEVER-- ANYWAY, YOU'RE COMIN' BACK WITH ME. YOU DON'T KNOW WHO THE FUCK I AM. OBVIOUSLY, DUPRELL DIDN'T TELL YOU EVERYTHING ABOUT ME. MY NAME IS PALINOV, NOT JENSEN! I'M ONLY IMPERSONATING THAT DESPICABLE BASTARD! OBVIOUSLY, YOU MISSED SOMETHING! JENSEN'S MEMORY WAS REPLACED WITH PALINOV'S, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND. I REALLY DON'T CARE WHAT THEY DID TO JENSEN'S BRAIN. YOU STILL DON'T GET IT. HA-- YOU STUPID IDIOT. YOU ARE JENSEN! I SHOULD KNOW-- I'VE KNOWN YOU SINCE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN. WHAT IF I TOLD YOU THAT I'M YOUR FATHER? MY FATHER WAS A SOLIDER. HE WON MEDALS, AND HE DIED A HERO! LOOK AT THAT LEG. LOOK AT THAT FUCKIN' SCAR! YOU DON'T REMEMBER WHERE YOU GOT IT? YOU GOT IT IN A PARKING LOT! SOME KID BIT YOU IN THE LEG, AND YOU ALMOST KILLED HIM FOR IT! PARKING LOT? RIGHT. I DREAMED THAT. KIDDO, YOU DID THAT! IT'S YOUR MIND TRYING TO TELL YOU WHO YOU REALLY ARE! HEY, GET HIM OFF ME! [ GRUNTING ] [ GUNSHOT ] COME ON. JENSEN, COME OUTTA THERE! I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU. YOU'RE WASTING BULLETS. JUST TALK TO HIM. I'LL GO AROUND THE BACK. JENSEN, COME ON! JUST TALK TO HIM. JENSEN, IT'S NOT LIKE I WANT YOU TO CALL ME DAD. WE'VE GOT NOTHING TO SAY TO EACH OTHER! JUST LEAVE ME ALONE! UGH! JUST RELAX. THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE. COME BACK TO MEGAVILLE WITH ME. NO. BOY, THEY REALLY FUCKED YOU UP WITH THAT IMPLANT. I'M GLAD THEY DID. THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY HARD FOR ME. [ GUN CLICKING ] THIS IS GONNA BE VERY EASY FOR ME. [ MUSIC ] DUPRELL? DUPRELL! I'M HERE. WHY PALINOV? PALINOV WAS THE MOST SUBMISSIVE MAN WE COULD FIND. WHERE IS HE? HE'S SAFE. SAFE? YOU CAN TAKE SOLACE IN KNOWING THAT THE MISSION WAS SUCCESSFUL, MR. PALINOV OR JENSEN... WHICHEVER YOU ARE NOW. I'LL SEE YOU BURN FOR THIS. DON'T THINK THAT YOU'VE INTIMATED ME IN THE SLIGHTEST. WHY ARE YOU SELLING DREAM-A-LIFE? DREAM-A-LIFE WILL BE USED TO SEDATE THE INSUBORDINATE ELEMENTS OF OUR SOCIETY. BY KEEPING MEDIA ILLEGAL, WE CAN ENSURE THAT DREAM-A-LIFE GETS INTO THE HANDS OF THE CRIMINALS-- VERY SIMPLE. [ GASPING ] RAYMOND? RAYMOND, ARE YOU THERE? RAYMOND? TALK TO ME, PLEASE, RAYMOND. TALK TO ME, PLEASE, RAYMOND. WHAT HAPPENED TWO WEEKS AGO WHEN YOU DRAGGED ME TO THAT UNSCHEDULED CHECK-UP? RAYMOND-RAYMOND, THEY LIED TO ME. THE DEVICE IN YOUR HEAD WILL KILL YOU. YOU'VE GOT TO GET RID OF IT BEFORE THEY SET IT OFF. I ONLY WANTED THE BEST FOR YOU, RAYMOND. YOUR FATHER WOULD BE SO PROUD. MOTHER? YES, RAYMOND. MY FATHER'S DEAD. YOU ARE ALL LIARS! YOU NEVER INTENDED FOR MY SON TO COME BACK TO ME, MY REAL SON! YOU WANT YOUR SON BACK? HELLER, GO GET HER SON. BUT, MR. DUPRELL-- GET HIM! MR. DUPRELL, IF YOU PERSIST IN MAKING SOME CAUSTIC PARADE OF MY LIFE'S WORK, I WILL BE FORCED TO FILE A FORMAL COMPLAINT TO THE ADMINISTRATION REGARDING THIS MATTER. MY SON. OH! HE'S WITHOUT-- HE'S ALMOST DEAD. AND IT WON'T BE LONG BEFORE HE MEETS HIS OTHER HALF. [ RAPID BEEPING ] OH-- OH! OH, GOD! OH, JEEZ. AH-- AH-- AH-- OH! [ RAPID BEEPING ] AH! NO! KILL HER! [ MUSIC ] UGH! [ GASPING ] I'M NOT PALINOV. I'M NOT JENSEN. I'M NOT EITHER-EITHER. WHAT? WE-- I'M SORRY. I CAN'T HEAR YOU. PALINOV WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. JENSEN WOULDN'T GIVE A SHIT. BUT, YOU HAVE TO FIGHT BACK. YOU CAN'T LET THESE PEOPLE DO THIS TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE. I JUST WANT IT TO HAVE BEEN A DREAM. DREAM IT AWAY. YOU CAN'T DREAM SOMETHIN' LIKE THE CKS AWAY. YOU HAVE TO. YOU CAN. [ MUSIC ] [ MUSIC ] [ MUSIC ] UGH! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, TONIGHT, I WELCOME A MOST INTERESTING SURPRISE GUEST TO OUR SHOW. I DON'T BELIEVE WHAT I'M SEEING, MR. DUPRELL. YOU-YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS. I GUARANTEE, AFTER YOU HEAR HIS TESTIMONY, THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT WILL NO LONGER BE THE SAME. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, TONIGHT'S SURPRISE GUEST TO THE TALK SHOW WILL INTRODUCE HIMSELF. HOW DID HE GET AWAY? WHAT'S GOING ON THERE? I MAY NOT KNOW WHO I AM, DOUGLAS, BUT I DO KNOW A FEW OTHER THINGS. THIS IS A VERY STRANGE-LOOKING NEWS BROADCAST. EVERYTHING IS EXAGGERATED IN MEGAVILLE. I WAS SENT TO IMPERSONATE A MEDIA DEALER BY THE NAME OF JENSEN AND HELP CKS TAKE CONTROL OF THE BLACK MARKET. MR. DUPRELL, THERE IS SOMETHING VERY WRONG HERE! AH-- I'M TRYING TO HEAR WHAT HE'S SAYING. THAT'S A RATHER OUTRAGEOUS STATEMENT. HE CAN'T PROVE ANYTHING. OW. OH. I HAVE PROOF OF ALL OF THAT BACK IN MY HOTEL ROOM THAT I KEEP ON A PERMANENT RENT IN THE HEMISPHERE. WHAT KIND OF PROOF? I HAVE AN ARMY-ISSUED SUITCASE FILLED WITH NOTES, TAPES, AND VARIOUS DOCUMENTS THAT WILL PROVE BEYOND A DOUBT THAT THE CKS INTENDS ON RUNNING THE BLACK MARKET. MR. DUPRELL, HOW COULD HE HAVE PROOF AT THE HOTEL OF WHAT HE DIDN'T KNOW WHEN HE WAS THERE? WE'LL FIND OUT, SOON AS WE GET THE SUITCASE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? MR. DUPRELL, YOU CAN'T-- GET THAT SUITCASE, RIGHT NOW! YES, SIR. [ MUSIC ] HELLER, WHERE'S THAT SUITCASE? THE SUITCASE IS DOWNSTAIRS WITH SECURITY. IT'LL BE ANOTHER 15 MINUTES TO CLEAR. GET IT UP HERE, NOW-- RIGHT NOW! MR. DUPRELL WANTS THE SUITCASE, NOW. NO, JUST GET IT UP HERE, AND I MEAN RIGHT NOW. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? THIS IS AN ORDER! [ MUSIC ] OPEN IT. [ EXPLOSION ] [ MUSIC ] I GOT YA. "THE MIND'S "A TERRIBLE THING TO WASTE," THEY USED TO SAY IN THE OLD WORLD. I'M INCLINED TO AGREE. SHOW ME A CONTENTED LAB RAT, AND I'LL SHOW YOU A [ INDISTINCT] ROTTING IN A PETRI DISH. SO NOW, I'M BUSTIN' MY NUTS OUT HERE, HOPIN' TO HELP THE KID. HA-- WHAT ARE DADS FOR, ANYWAY? I WISH WE COULD'VE SPENT MORE TIME TOGETHER, YOU AND I. [ GUNSHOT ] OH. [ LAUGHTER ] OH, NO! [ MUSIC ]
