That was awesome! Go, Mehdi! -We can't see him! -I'm scared of heights. What? It's all in your head, Miss! What you're doing is dangerous. We can handle it. -You'll end up in wheelchairs. -Kids don't think of that! It's forbidden! We know, we know everything! Nothing's forbidden. No one forbids me nothing! Let's show her, Jo! Come on! Show us your stuff! Here, pal. See if it's forbidden, Miss. Go on! Show us your stuff! One, two, three! Come on! Three seconds, or forget it. I'm frozen. I'm not scared! -You don't have to do it. -Yes, I do! Forget it, it's dangerous. Talk about embarrassing! Did you hear? It's dangerous! Talk about embarrassing! Stick it on the net. -OK? -Yes. Hello? Sorry I'm on late. I'm on my way. I'm really sorry. I'll go in later but the water's well cold. Mehdi, Mehdi, Mehdi ! What you doing? I'm talking to you! Get up! What you up to? Guys! This gadji is going through our stuff! You've got a cheek! What are you playing at? I asked you a question! And people say Arabs are thieves! Want me to wipe the floor with you? Don't look at me like that! Get a move on! Hey, my phone! What you doing with it? -I've got my own! -Oh yeah? Give it here, for fuck's sake! This crazy bitch has been nicking our stuff! She's got pics of us. She'll give us away on Facebook! Hey, that's me! Mehdi, you've scored! Come here, you! What are you up to? Give it here! Let me delete it, or I'll deck you. -We said give us the phone. -Chill! I never gave her my permission! -She's gonna delete it. -Go on. Turned on by our mates? Just delete it! We said delete it. You know what? Make her jump, man! -Like this? -Make her jump! She won't jump, what a loser! -Stop. -Why should we? She can do it. Come on, jump! Get going! Who's gonna jump? -Who, huh? -We are! Come on. Settle down. We're gonna jump. Get a move on. Go on! I can't. -What's wrong? -It's just water! It's only six meters. You can go feet first! -Us lot dive in! -Come on. I'll show you how it's done. Go, Jo! Take your dress off and jump. Come on! She's a right pain! Miss La-di-da! We'll show you. Come on, girls! Your turn! Go on, jump! You don't need to look down. Ready? Get a move on! She'll never jump. Just push her! What is it now? Bitch! I'm scared of heights. Come on, you slag, jump! Fucking hell! Me too sometimes. Come on, you'll be OK. Let's go further down. Come on. Hey, get a move on! Come on! Let's go back up. Bye, Bambi! See you! You'll love it after this. We'll jump together, OK? Take deep breaths with me. One, Two. Three! Where is she? Silly cow! No, I'm not at home. I was on the corniche. With some friends. Everything's fine, don't worry. You're gonna tell me what you're playing at. You take my phone, pics... Then you act tough and totally blank us. What's the big deal? What's the big deal? You're raving! -You wouldn't mind? -It's just some photos! -"Some photo"? You don't know us! -You were far away. So what? You don't go taking pictures of people you don't know. Delete the photos. Yeah, I'll see. What do you mean? You just don't give up do you? Wipe that smile off your face! -Told you! -Yeah. She's got to go. Tell her to get lost, bro. She did what she had to do, bro. She should get lost, bro! The snob's gonna do you over. Laters, guys! Bye! She heard you loud and clear! Hey, lend me your scooter. I have to work. Come on, bro! -Hey, Mama! -You're wound up. It's her doing. The bitch got me worked up. Why? What did she do to you? Forget it! Nothing! That's him. Hey, René! You OK? It's OK, she's the new chief. You can trust her. She's like me. OK. Look, René, everyone'd be happy if Abder got lost. Give me the address. It's complicated! Those guys move around. They're cagey. His phone number then. I give you what I can, Gianni. But Abder's a psycho. The guy's mental. René... That's Abder. Who's this? De Souza. Aristide. You'll find him. He's got form. Where did you snap them? Because, honestly... They're good. Who's that guy? It's Marco. Just a kid. He's under my wing. He works for me. Drives me around. He's a good lad. Where's he from? The hood, like us. Pretty scary. It's him, huh? I reckon so. Definitely! You sniffed him out. Yeah! Got a ciggy, bro? Hey, crew! Come see what Jo caught. It's a beaut, huh? Is that an eye? -Look at your hand! -Give it to Hamza! I swear if it touches me, I'll floor it. Why is it all sticky? I'm afraid to touch it. Put your hand like this. -I gave it five. -Awesome! It isn't sticky now. It'll die. -Is it alive? -Sure it is. Don't leave it there. It'll crawl out. Who gives a toss? I want a word with you. Just chill! We told you to get lost. It's private property? We already told you. Stop! Where you from? So you're local. Yeah. And you? Me? Les Aygalades. -Heard of it? -Yeah, but I never go there. Some surprise! What do you do? School or uni? -School. -You're bunking off! I found you out! Don't fret. I left school at 14. I got good grades. But I was a "troublemaker". Crazy, huh? -Diploma or vocational course? -Diploma. I almost did Applied Arts. You do art? My parents made me do a diploma. "It opens more doors." The exams are next week. Philosophy, and then... Literature: Oedipus Rex, Madame Bovary. I haven't revised. It's nice where you live. Sorry. Hello? Yes, René. I'm not on the corniche. I'm in Cassis. How could I have known! OK, see you later. Listen, girl, you can't stay here. Go if you know what's good for you. I want to jump from there. Show me the spot. Will you? You'll get mashed. Why should I anyway? You came to talk to me! You didn't get what we said last time. You can't just turn up and say, "Show me the spot." We can't go to your villa or school. Madame Bovary! This is our patch. What do you want? If I show you, will you kiss me? What? It's a deal. -Hey, guys! -What? The dud wants to jump. She can go fuck herself! She needs us? Slag! She can jump on her own. She's dodgy too. And weird. -She's sweet. -Hey, Marco! Don't help her. We jump from up there. We know how, she doesn't. It's her business. If she croaks, she croaks. Is she gonna sign a waiver? Crazy bitch! Tank ass! What we gonna do with this? Cook it, bro. -Hold on tight! -There's no ladder. She's in trouble, man. If she gets mashed, guys, we'll pay for it. She ain't my sister or my cousin! -She's with us. -Let's ignore her. -We got it, bro. -What's so funny? Marco! You traitor! He's led by his dick! You OK? Look at me. Are you OK? What's your name? -Suzanne. -That's a pretty name. Wanna go back down? No. I'll help you. Here. Put your foot near mine. Your foot... Your legs aren't like mine! Come on. I'm holding you. That's it. That's good. She's a daddy's girl and you're a traitor! Brother! All right? Are you scared? You scared, princess? You loved it last time! I'm here to help you. I want my kiss. Come on. Well? She's gonna jump. Well, Suzanne! What kind of name's that? It's an old lady's name! Hey, Suzannah, let's go! You ready? Here goes! Come on. We'll jump together. We'll count to three. On three, we jump, OK? Here goes. One... Two... Three! -Well? -Well what? Bye! Let's split. Don't hog it. That was awesome! Mind the bend! Bananas make you fat. That's for sure! We need one more. -Merguez! -Give us some ketchup. We've got merguez! You love meat, huh? Get lost! You eat like a pig. Gimme some crisps. Don't I get any? Where are the cups? Don't I get any crisps? -Got a cup? -Just drink it. Wicked! He's a kid! They're our age. They're slaving away. The boss is mad. Which one's the boss? The one without a hat. I swear she's got a knife up her sleeve. With her spatulas... They'd never hire you! Hey, guys! We've got the cutlets. We're all set. -Ready? -Yeah! We're having a barbie, bro. Get a move on! Merguez, merguez! We've got a visitor! Hello! A stranger, guys, in action. -Who is it? -Hello. -Who's she? -A Whitey! It's my mom. Suzanne. Come eat with us. We've got cutlets, sausages and merguez. -Why not? -It's à la carte here. Sausage. Which sauce? -Halal mustard? Ketchup? -Mustard. Shot of whisky? When I see you jump, my heart stops. You're risking your life. Don't you realize? We do it 40 times head first, every day too. It's dangerous! If you mess up, you'll end up in a wheelchair! I was scared too at first. But it's fine. It's normal you worry, you're a mom. If my mom knew, she'd kill me. For sure! Ma'am! We've been doing it forever. We're pros. Don't worry about her, we're training her. She'll be a pro. We've taught her loads. She's well good, ma'am. What about your exams? When do you revise? It's better if you're chilled. There's no need to revise. We're doing no harm. Just hanging with friends. I'm just chilling with my friends. With your friends? Sure! You call them friends? They're letting you take risks! What are you on about? I'm calling your father. Just you wait! -Crazy cow! -Call the pigs, the riot squad, the police! You forgot your veggie sandwich! Get the pigs! Your old lady's crazy. For sure! We respected you, so respect us! No manners! Your old lady's a nutter! Stop! Hey, Suzanne! Film us? Hamza, you clown! Go on, jump! Show us... -Show us your stuff! -Your balls! Hey, guys! Film. Go on, jump in! Keep filming. Show us your balls! Get down. Come on! -Customs is here! -It's dangerous. -Get down. -It ain't dangerous. It's too shallow. What's your advice today? -The same as always? -Just be careful. It's dangerous. Look... That sign says so. It's shallow. You'll die. You've got pretty eyes. He wouldn't have otherwise. See you soon! Have a good day. Marco! Hi. Marco! All right, Suzanne? What you doing here? Nice set of wheels. Not bad, huh? It's for work. Why were you in there? It's expensive, huh? If you go everyday... They train champions. You're a champ, huh? A little mermaid! Whose car is it then? Some businessmen's. You could say I'm their right-hand man. -Great. -Got your exams Monday? Oedipus Rex, Madame Bovary, are you prepared? -Dunno. -Do you feel ready? I don't know. My phone's ringing, sorry. Hello? Yes. I'm over here. I can see you. OK, yes. See you shortly. -See you later? -OK, then. Hi. Gianni, overtake us. Let a car go past. He'll spot us. Let that car go. What are they doing? They've clocked us. Gianni, go round the block. Do you have a light? Got your lighter? Thanks. Thanks, Captain! Do I know you? We know you. Don't we, René? Let's go. Come on. Pull over, on the right. Abder! It wasn't my fault. -Marco! -You fucking grass! Marco! We landed him in it! Fuck! Just calm down. Look, we know nothing. OK? We keep quiet. If there are problems, I'll deal with the judge. We keep quiet? What do I tell his mom? She's like a mom to me! Who's René for you? What is he? Nothing! Nobody! I grew up with him. Let go of me! Gianni, listen. We're in this together. You're not alone. We'll get Abder, OK? Do you hear? He'll pay. -We know they're in Plan d'Aou. -Plan d'Aou? Plan d'Aou! This is Marseille. Go back home, you fool! -Get off! -Calm down. Please. Leave me alone! Calm down! Get off our case! They're at Sugiton, your little jerks. I'm sick of this. Let's get them now. I'm going up. -Laters. -Be careful. Will do. We're here. Go on, Mehdi! Yeah, Mehdi! Go, Mehdi! Yay! You OK? He'll be fine. Want us to call a chopper? Once you're up there, that's it. You have to jump. He can't do it. Nice here, huh? Far from everything. We should stay here. Yes, Medhi! Nice one! Well? Nice one! You were awesome. She was way more scared than you were. Stop necking the bottle! We stopped hours ago, and you're still at it. Now that... Now that... What now, huh? What now? Be nice, OK? Be nice. Don't spit booze at me. It's disgusting. Mehdi, stop. Stop! Mehdi, stop! Marco, do something. What's he gonna do? I'm gonna get you. Let me pinch you. Near your breast. Just next to it. Come on, be nice! Enough! I quit. Stop it. You're stronger than me! I can't come now. Stop it. Goodbye. Leave me alone, I need a joint. I'm shivering like a puppy. It's cold, huh? Fuck. -It's doable. -There? They close at midnight. I've got this crazy vision. We nick some flares and jump with them. Passersby will panic. They see 10 of us! Red everywhere! We should do it at the Club. In the middle of town, bro. No? I've got cash. Hungry? -You bet! -Sure? How about eating there? You're on! Talk about perfect... This meat is succulent. You've done us proud. It's good, huh? We're gonna wow them too. Flares, the lot! We'll light the place up! I'm excited. I can't wait, bro. Truth is, -I've got a bad feeling about it. -Why? The cops will show up and take us in. Won't be the first or last time! -It's dodgy. -What you afraid of? What do you mean? Have you been talking? You agreed with me earlier! You were up for it. You had the same vision. Now we're eating, do we just forget it? Drop it. -Don't talk to me like that! -I'm speaking my mind. Bro, she's right. Forget the Club. It's heavily guarded. There's a cop-shop, it's crawling with pigs. It's even guarded at night. You two make me sick. I'm gutted. I've lost my appetite. I'm off. -Seriously? -We had a plan. You were up for it and now you say forget it? Enjoy yourselves! I don't care about the Club. That was my old life. Exams, Madame Bovary, Oedipus Rex... I might not go tomorrow. Course you're gonna go. What's wrong with you? Your exams? Come on! Look, we'll do your spot. Just trust me. We'll jump from up there. It'll be awesome. I'll arrange everything. For you. Suzanne... I like you. Do you like me? I have to go. Thanks. Suzanne! Come on, Jo! I've got seaweed between my toes! Both of them are my mates. I won't tell you who to choose. You can't have them both. I understand you though! She's well lucky. It's gonna end in tears, I can tell you. Why'd you say that? Because it just will. No way! Only if you pick one. The other's bound to be pissed off. You're so negative! Wait! I've known them... forever, like. Medhi's my cousin and Marco's like a brother. Marco... I've known him since nursery school. He's a great guy. But very sensitive. Mehdi, the poor thing, is a big-bellied blob! -Hey! -Meanie! The cops! Fucking wankers! Fucking wankers! Go! Fucking bastards! Fucking wankers! Come on, girls! For us, you're nobody. It's Abder we're after. Abder was inside for 10 years. Drug dealing, armed robbery, homicide... You're on probation, huh? What you got on me? Nothing! What's this? My savings. 800 euros? My grandma gave it to me. Does she give change? Can I call her? Leave my grandma out of this! What you doing? What if I said you had more than two lumps of hash? Fucking bastard! -Where's Abder? -I dunno. -Where's Abder hiding? -I don't know! You're covering for a scumbag! -Answer! -Easy, Gianni. Why? Maybe he did it. Who killed René? Hey, who killed René? Who was it? He's broken my arm! Stop! That's enough. -You're a fucking liar. -That's enough. You're a traitor to your race! A Black working for the pigs? Why? You're a fucking disgrace. I'm not black, I'm a cop. Remove his cuffs. I'm taking them off 'cuz she asked me. But I can put them back on. I'd be sad to see you in prison. You have your life ahead of you. Abder doesn't care about you. I'm fond of you. What do you want? I'm not a grass! I'm not asking you to be. Just tell us where he lives. No one will ever know. We won't let on. You have my word. What will your mom and brother do if you end up inside? Possession of arms, drug dealing... You'll go down for years. Touch my mom and brother, and I'll knife you! Oh yeah? Sit down, or I'll cuff you again, OK? Stay still and shut up! Fuck! Now you've nabbed me, everyone will know. If I talk or keep quiet, I'll be mown down. Look, Marco, it's very simple. It's up to you. Give us Abder within two days, or you'll end up in Les Baumettes. You can go. Your mom's here. I'll wait outside. Get a move on! His family refuses to come. I'll take responsibility. I'll drop him off. It's a caution. Go if you don't want hassle. Your family didn't come. My mom's busy. Where's your dad? We couldn't find him. You're a minor, they should've come. My mom's sick of the station. I was in custody every night. I saw. I've calmed down. Do you know Abder? -No. -Are you sure? Positive. Never heard of him? You've never met Abder? Your mate Marco... mustn't end up in jail like your brother. Don't talk about him. I don't wanna be seen with you. Stop here, please. So... Do you have any plans? I do, yeah. That's good. It beats jumping or dealing. Oh yeah? Nothing beats it! You're clueless. I'm a diver. Have been since I was a kid. I like defying... What's the word? I like flirting with death. Look at yourself, little cop. It's like you're not here. You're lifeless, I'm buzzing. I'm really up for life. Open the door. I have to take you home. Come on! OK, I'll trust you. Don't land me in it, go home. All right. Hello? Hello? Who's calling? Where are you? I'm on my way. The blow's stashed. A lock-up in Roucas-Blanc. The address? Rue des Roches. That's it. I've gotta go. Marc! Marco! You bothered me for that? Forget the drugs! I want Abder. OK. I'm calling the judge. I chill for two months inside then I'm out. It'll be no holiday. Everyone will know you grassed. What? You're the grass. You're betraying your race! Abder. His address. You'll go down, OK? Rue Emile Duployé. No. 17. You OK? So this is the Club? I don't wanna go in. I'm not into it. I don't like standing out. Please. I wasn't interested at first. But I trained hard, and it came to me. Like other things that come gradually. It can't be any other way. Let's go. Well? Better than the Club, huh? What do you think? Want a drink? Come on, then. It's my brother Karim's. It's his hide-out. We come when we can. My bro thinks a lot, but not of everything. Mom was too weak with him. But I'm different. My mom's everything. She's everything to me. She's small, she's had a hard life. I cook for her every day. I put the telly on. I take care of her. She has Breton roots. My dad's Tunisian. He left when I was four. Here. Come on. There's more. Go to the lock-up. They're there. Your bracelets are nice. -Did you make them? -No, I bought them. And the crucifix? Do you pray often? No. I don't really practice. Having faith helps. I've asked God a lot. But He didn't give me much. It's my fault really. I don't do stuff. I don't do Ramadan... Here's your pal. But I've calmed down. I'm still young, see? You have a lovely smile. You too. Police! Put Abder there, her the opposite and Aristide in that car. See you at the station. We can catch up. We've been screwed! There was just a car in the lock-up. No drugs, nothing. Your mate Marco took the piss. His mom's not seen him, his phone's dead. We'll discuss it later! Let's go. There are tons of urchins. I'm happy with you. You're the mermaid, I'm the pirate. Suzannah! We could stay here forever. Yeah, why not? We could live off nature. We'd eat sea bass, bream, urchins, octopus... -No one knows we're here. -True. They're cleaning up. Two dead youths in Bonneveine carpark. An hour ago. Let's go. What the hell's that? I lost someone close because of that shit. I don't touch it anymore! Let's go. We can't stay here. Let's chuck it in the sea. Come here! Stop, for fuck's sake. We can't chuck it or keep it. What you doing? Stop! You're mad. Know how much there is? At least three kilos. Know what it's worth? It's like gold. It's like we had three bars. It's pure. We can make five, ten times more. Just zip up the bag. We can't do that. It's worth loads of money. It could change everything. Don't you see? Who the hell put it there? Shit! -Let's go home. -OK. Let's go. Where the fuck are they? About time! Look at this! -Yay! -Hallelujah! Mate, it's been years! Look at this! Marco did us proud. It wasn't me, bro, it was her. They're like truncheons. Here, look. -Here, Julie. -Give it a break. -It isn't open! -Don't muck about. -Come here. -Where are the others? Hold it here. Things are weird between us. -It's fine, bro! -You know what I mean. What? Everything's cool. What you on about? I swear! Come on. Go! In position. Time for operation commando. We're the Marseille posse! Shut it! Come on, guys! Take two. See? I kept my word. Frankie! Go on. We're the posse! The pigs, guys! Jump in, quick! They're coming. Hurry! Get down! Come on! Move it! Let's get outta here. Go, go! Come on, Suzanne. This sucks! The cops are here! Don't hold us up. Get down! I can't. Fuck the world! We exist! My leg! -We've gotta go to the hospital. -We have to. It's ugly. Move your hand. Don't touch me. Move your hand! Just relax. You OK? Can I trust you? You grew up in luxury. Us lot have problems. I've found something really valuable. I've stashed it. You're burning up. You know, I've been thinking. And it's like capital. Like an inheritance. We could go away, the three of us. Open a restaurant, a garage. You know, a business. Somewhere like Italy. You know what? We take the scooter tonight and head for the border. I've got contacts. They could help us. The three of us ride away with the drugs? We'd never make it! Why go stash it in Karim's creek? My bro has had enough problems! You found it? Course we did! I didn't give you the key to hide shit! Marco! You know I wanna make good. -You took her? -Yeah! So what? Who gives a fuck! Seriously, Marco. Suzanne, say something. Stop crying! You don't know us! What are we for you? Crash course in the hood? It's our life! The only one we've got. And I'm proud of my life, my mom, my family... Get lost! Go back to Mommy and Daddy. To your cushy life. Fuck you! -Don't talk to me like that! -Get off. I forgot about my exams and the Club! I don't give a toss about the Club! Do I ask you stuff? Just get lost. Fuck this! Give me a break. Mehdi, bro. I got Abder nicked. I took his stash. He's gonna kill me. Fuck! Let's get outta here. Come on, let's go. Marco! Bro! Marco! Stay with us! We can't stay here, bro. It hurts. I'll help you. I can't! We'll get mown down. Precisely! Let's go. They showed René no mercy! Get going. Mehdi, take her! Take her with you. What are you on about? I'm turning myself in. At least in jail... -You can't do that. -Cut the crap! Did you do it for nothing? The three of us will go, OK? We'll have a nice life. We're gonna go. Move, for fuck's sake! No! Stop this. Fuck, Mehdi help me! Let go of me. Help me! It's Marco. I'm turning myself in. Give it here. Give it to me! I'm at Bonneveine carpark. Give it here! Go! They're on their way. Suzanne, look at me. Go with him. Please. Mehdi, take her with you. Keep my share safe, for when I get out. I'm not a donkey! Haven't you seen how she's been looking at you? Suzannah, you're going with him. You drive. Go to Italy, head for Turin. I don't want you getting nicked again, OK? It's too much. My brother, you... Seriously! Marco, you two go. Go on, get going. Take your phone. Go! Come on! Get going. -Go on. -And you? I don't care about me. I'm a minor. They've got nothing on me. Nothing, bro! Go on, get on. Suzanne, get on. I'm a minor but I've got balls. Come on, Marco. Please, bro. Get on, get going. See you later. Fuck! Fuck it! Fuck! I'm gonna... Fuck! Cuff him! Where's Marco? Tell me! Tonight, you join your brother in jail. Talk, for fuck's sake! Take him in. No, we just arrested the kid. Prison's no place for him. I'm on my way. OK. Don't move! Put the bag down. Did you hear me? Put that bag down! Get on the ground. Lie down. I want to see your hands. I'm coming down. Hey, you! Put it down. Put the bag down. I'm scared of heights. Disappear. Go. Go on!
