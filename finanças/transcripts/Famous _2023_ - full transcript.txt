My man's all right. So, you said bye to coronavirus by getting the vaccine. But, problems with cocaine, though, your ex, she actually said that she left you, because you're still having problems with drugs. Famous? Well, we see your stepdad in that photo, but he's also your driver, so... I only get dumped when I'm sober. And I wanna dump me too. So, you are sober? Okay, well, no matter what the ladies say, your brother never leaves you. Your brother and producer, Plain Wayne, He is like an angel for you. Dressed always in white suits, always trying to save you. Yeah, but he can't seem to save his own love life. He's been engaged three times in the past three years. To three models no less. But some say he's always ending things with his fiancées because he's got something else to focus on. Like you. He's not my brother, my real brother. Okay, well, he's your step brother, and loads of us have family that aren't our real family, these are just the connections that make us who we are. And we need that, because our real family is gone. Your mother passed away from cancer. Your father was a musician and an addict, just like you. But he left your family after he got out of jail. Sometimes the best thing an addict can do is say goodbye. -[host] What? -[Famous] Or die. [host] What-- what did you say? -God dammit! -Hey. Everything's going to be okay. And this is a time where so many people are having problems with mental health. [host speaking indistinctly] Just angels, like our... -[Wayne] Thanks, Seven Trees -[host] ...and your brother. Now, let's hear a song you wrote about you and your brother. "Money Team." ♪ Money, money, money team ♪ [journalist] So, you're declining to comment on the statements that Famous made on The Drive Home show? [Musharraf] Yeah, no, we appreciate The Post calling in. [chuckles] I wouldn't worry about that interview. Famous is just being his old dramatic self.

Bye-bye. -[line beeps] -[sighs] [keyboard music playing] How are we? [stops playing] [continues playing] What-- en-- enlighten me. What is this? Just a song. The song I used to play. Before he went away. It's about getting old. Getting old? You know you're forever 29, right? He used to say that getting old is the best part of life. You know how this business works, you've been in it long enough. We gotta stay current. We've got to put out what they want. Old is not the formula, right? Look, I-- all right, I get it. Bad day. But Musharraf and I, we know how to spin this, okay? We're going to turn things around. It's gonna be gold, okay? -You with me? -[whispering] Yeah. Right, okay. And, lest you forget, uh, tonight is the model party. Brazilians. Huh? [laughs] Oh, that's gonna be a good one. See, there you go. Everyone's always looking at me like I'm the one with the problem, but it's you. You can't stop. You have a fiancée. Or you had a fiancée, they're moving her out right now. What was wrong with Nyala? She's Ethiopian, like my mom. -Don't you want to settle down? -It's not about me. It's about you. All right? I need you to do me a solid. There's this real hottie, that's going to be there, and she won't shut up about you, so I need you to come. It's gonna be fun, you're gonna have a blast. Have I ever been wrong? No. Say you're gonna come. Say it. -All right. -That's what I like to hear. Meet me out front. -[door clicks shut] -[Famous sighs] I know this... [muffled] You want some cocaine? Uh, okay.

She told me to focus on life. But I just wanted to make her my wife. I promised her that I was done doing everything that was doing me in. But I don't think she believed me. Like she met me before or someone just like me. -[Ernestine] And your name is? -Jenny Favero. Oh. Oh, I-- I'm sorry, your name is not on the list. And unfortunately, we're not dispensing to anyone whose name is not. Oh, but I need my methadone. But if you would like to come back to a drop-in, we can help you out with getting your funding. Does that sound like something? But I'm-- no, I need it now. [Eileen] I know. -Follow me. -But-- [chuckles] [shouting] It's music time! [man] Hold on, guys. Something might be goin' on. [Famous] I met someone like me before. My father. But I felt him coming back to me, coming around me again. His music, his message, just lately... and I've been wanting to say goodbye. Maybe go where he went. Well... we've all had to tell a lady we're not who we used to be. And we're all about second chances, not life sentences. [host] Hey, where are you going? [speaking Spanish] Uh, they want music instead of methadone? Well, music can help lift your dopamine levels, just like methadone and crack, cocaine, and opiates. [sighs] [man] Hey, Eileen, the band's ready for any of your usuals. Hi, everyone. This is a song that someone would sing to me. Um... My mom, she was... Someone who tried really hard. Just like all of you. Now, this is a Supreme song called "TCB," which means "Taking Care of Business," and my mom really liked it, 'cause she said, "That's all we gotta do." ♪ Stop ♪ ♪ Whatever you're doing, hold it right there ♪ ♪ Drop ♪ ♪ Whatever you're doing, there's not a minute to spare ♪ ♪ Time is flying, grab it ♪ ♪ Break that nowhere habit ♪ ♪ And TCB ♪ ♪ TCB ♪ ♪ TCB ♪ ♪ Do it now ♪ ♪ Don't sit around and wonder when to ♪ ♪ Now is the time for all good men to ♪ ♪ You know the way to start today ♪ ♪ And TCB ♪ ♪ TCB ♪ ♪ What's the use of sittin' safe and sound ♪ ♪ With your head in the sand? ♪ ♪ Pull it out and take a look around ♪ ♪ Take a stand, and you'll be taking care of business ♪ ♪ Taking care of business, taking care of business ♪ ♪ TCB ♪ ♪ TCB ♪ ♪ TCB ♪ ♪ Do it now ♪ [audience applauding] [phone buzzing] -[Wayne] Hello. -Uh. -Hello. -[Eileen] Hello?

Oh, get a load of this. Oh, I knew you'd be down here. Interview went really well, man. All right. Yeah-- He was a little bit shaky at times, but, you know, he was good, he was great, he was awesome. -He was-- -Oh, awesome. [Musharraf] Hey, are those the new promo shots? -That photography is crazy. -It's just a-- It's okay, it's just for album cover ideas that we're-- we're thinking about, so, uh... it's not quite ready, but I'll show it to you when they're- when they're ready, okay? -You're doing a great job. -Thanks. ♪ Hey, Musharraf. [Musharraf] Yo, I got to tell you something. -[Famous] What? -[Musharraf] Your brother, he's got pictures of you and your girl in bed. [Famous] No. No. [shouting] I'm going to kill my brother. Desmond, take me home. [shouting] Now! Hi. It-- it's great to see you. You-- you look lovely. I told you he wouldn't stop, hmm? -You know who? -Oh! You can't be reading that crap. And I promise, he's done. He'll never be done. It's not what you think. I mean, yes, tabloid's right. He's got a new fiancée, but you know what's really going on. He's-- he's just a bit stressed about his brother. Or is always being with one's least preferred gender just another way of always being in control? -You've gotta be joking. -He likes being in control. He needs to be in control. -Even of you. -No! He's perfect. Wait. I'm-- I'm sorry, I-- Please, tell me. You're right. For some, they're able to control themselves at all times... until they reach their limit. Oh, my God. He gave me the night off. Where is he? [footsteps departing] [Eileen] Wh-- why are you home so early? W-- w-- where are you going? I'm always going. But I always come back. -[Eileen sighs] -That's my girl. You'll always be my girl. Um... No. No? No, no. [shouting] You'll be here when I come back. Do you understand? Yeah, that's my girl. [phone dings] [phone dings] [breathing heavily] [door clicks open] [Famous] Hey! Hey! I've hated your guts for years. I've been doing drugs to recover from you. But I never would have done what you did. Surveillance? Spyin' on me and my girl? I had to follow you. Or else you were gonna slip away. What are you doing? That party idea? You were right. That was stupid. No, no, you-- you've always been there for me. I should never have suggested it. Although, that girl of yours... she's a keeper. Not like the others. All they wanted was drugs and money. They didn't love you. Don't you get that? I devoted... my whole life to you, man. I gave you everything. Just-- just put down the knife, please. [voice cracking] Just stay back. Don't come any closer, I'm telling you. I love you. I'm your brother. [Wayne breathing heavily] Don't come any closer.
