Sorry? What are you sorry about? You didn't make the world, and neither did I. And if we had, I'm not so sure we would have made it any different. Correction. Drop that whole speech and substitute... um... substitute... Sorry. What is there to be sorry about? We didn't make the world. And if we had, what a mess we would have made of it, being what we are. Sorry. What is there to be sorry about? We didn't make the world. And if we had, what a mess we would have made of it, being what we are. Oh Bob, I've been redoing that speech at the end of act II. Type it and send it to the theater. That'll mean Pearce learning some new lines. He never learned the old lines. So new one's won't make any difference. Most of the time opening night I thought he was in some other play, and I wished I was in some other theater. That's no business of mine, but you've got a play that's a smash hit in New York. It looks like being one here. Why not leave it alone? What do you suggest I do instead? Take a walk around the National Gallery or sit here and rot? Or maybe go back to New York and Rot. Get it over to the theater right away. Good afternoon. Is this Mr. Hannon's apartment? That's right. I wonder if I might see him. Would you please tell him, Jean Lennox is here? Is he expecting you? No. Excuse me, but... are you a friend of Mr. Hannon? Well, I think of myself as one. Won't you wait inside? Excuse me a moment, madam. Ask Miss Lennox to come in. Will you come in, please, Miss Lennox. Hello, Phil. Hello, Jean. What are you doing in London? Oh, just a vacation. I wanted to drop in and say hello... and congratulate you on getting such wonderful notices. You came 3,000 miles for that? No, of course not. Phil, why didn't you let me know when you were leaving New York? You know the answer to that. Johnny and Pat are in London. Have you called them? I haven't called anybody, I've been busy working. Phil, I don't see why you insist on acting this way. Jean, we've been all over this a dozen times. When a thing is finished, I like to forget it. Let's talk about something else, shall we? Do you like the apartment? It's lovely. Come and look at this beautiful view. Houses of Parliament over there. There's Big Ben watching over us. They're doing some work on him, as you can see. Charing Cross station. Over there we have Waterloo Bridge and St Paul's Cathedral. We even have some prehistoric ruins that date right back to 1941. Don't be so bitter Phil. It doesn't help. Bitter? Me? I'm a successful playwright who's just had a hit! A big hit. What have I got to be bitter about I'm alright as long as people leave me alone. I wish people would leave things where they're supposed to be. I have to go out now, Jean. Were you going someplace? No. Just back to the apartment I guess. Oh you've taken an apartment? Well, I must come and see your view some time. Bob, I'm going out. Shall I come along? No, I'm only going to the pub. - The Eagle? - Yes. Are you sure you don't... Quite sure! Quite sure. Look, if you must do something, you can call a cab for Miss Lennox. And when you've finished typing up that new stuff, You can pick me up in the car at the Eagle, and drive me to the theater. Goodbye, Jean. Goodbye, Phil. Nice of you to look me up. Do you want a cab, Miss Lennox? Oh, no, thank you. I can manage. - You mustn't do that, you know. - What? Well, fuss over him like that. He'll go crazy if you do that. I don't like him out alone. I know, but he must if he thinks he can. Where is this bar? It's two streets down, across the road. Across the road? Yes. You can see it from here. Allow me. Oh thank you. Have you worked for him long? Only since he came over here the last time. Nearly two months. Is he drinking? Well, not exactly drinking, but not exactly not! Have you known him a long time, Miss Lennox? Well, yes. I was his secretary for three years in New York and here... and here... wherever he wanted to go. We were engaged to be married. And then it happened. He didn't like having me around. So I was fired. I'm sorry. What's it to be this evening dear? Scotch, please, double. Soda or water? Neither. Straight. You're American, aren't you? Yeah. Then you'd like a bit of ice in it eh? No thanks. I've learned to like it your way. Here we are, then. Thanks. What makes you so tired, dear? It'd be a long dreary story, one I'm sure you've heard many times before. But not from a young fellow like you. Will that do? That'll do fine. Thank you. I don't want nothing to do with it, Mr. Evans. I don't like the sound of it. You'll like the money, alright. It'll be more than this last job. Much more. But how do I know what you will do with it? You needn't have to worry about that. You just do what I tell you, and take the money and forget it. It's dirty somehow, when people have trust in you. Would you like me to say a little prayer? You promised that when I went with His Lordship that would be the last thing. This is a much bigger come on... Mary arrives on the tenth. You go down to meet her and take it over. Then we take it off your hands and give you your money. What is simpler than that? You don't understand. I might get to like it. No time for that. No. No, Mr. Evans. I won't do it. I won't! Oh... now listen. In less than five minutes. So think that over! You wouldn't do that. You wouldn't! No, I wouldn't do that. Just as long as you do as you're told. Come on, pull yourself together. There's nothing to cry about. All right. Is there decency left anyway. When do you want this? Night of the ninth, same address. I'll take you down. Then you start the job on the tenth. All right. Can I go now? What's the hurry? Have another drink. No, I have to get back. Her Ladyship's going to a concert and there will be no one to see to them. I'll walk out with you. Which way do you go? Just to the corner. 73 takes me right to the door but they always get so full. Miss? Miss? Would you come here, please? Yes, dear? Those two people who just went out. Do you know them? A man and a girl? No, never saw them before. That I can remember. Well, what were they like? I don't know dear. Just a man and a girl. Were they tall, short, young or old? Well, he was a bit taller than she was. Not very tall, not very old. Sort of medium people all round. Were they sixteen or sixty? To tell the truth, I didn't look at them particularly. But I think they were, you know, thirtyish. Maybe her a bit younger. Anything the matter, Mr. Hannon? Oh, Bob, When you came in, did you see a man and a woman leaving? No, There was no one coming out just now. Miss, there must have been something about them you noticed. Well I think she had a blue cape and he a raincoat. Anyhow, they came right by you dear, much nearer to you than to me. You saw them, didn't you? No, I didn't see them. I don't see things nowadays. I'm sorry, Sir, I didn't realise. That's all right. You weren't intended to. Both of medium height. Age - probably 25 to 35. Woman thought to be wearing a blue cape, man a raincoat. The woman used a perfume. The man breathed with a slight wheezing sound as though having, having bronchial trouble. Anyway there was something strange about his voice. The police are coming round right away. Okay. Now be quiet. Let me finish this. The conversation went as follows: "I want anything to do with it, Mr. Evans. I don't like the sound of it." "Oh, you'll like the money alright. And It'll be more than this last job. Much more." "But how do I know what you're gonna do with it?" "When do you want me?" "The night of the ninth, same address. Then I take you down and you start the job on the tenth." "All right. Can I go now?" "What's the hurry? Have another drink." "No. I've got to get back. Her Ladyship is going to a concert and there'll be no one to see to them." "I'll walk out with you. Which way do you go?" "Just to the corner. 73 takes me right to the door but they get so full." "That's all there was. I couldn't hear any more. Then they came out." Well? You've done that verbatim, Mr. Hannon? That's the conversation word for word? Yes. You must have a remarkable memory. Well, it's my business to remember dialogue. Well, what do you think? Was that all there was Mr. Hannon? Well isn't that enough for you? There's something evil going on isn't there? - Might be. - What do you mean, might be? Well you tell us what you make of it, Sir. I figure it out like this. This woman has something to do with children. Probably a nursemaid. That's why she had to get back, because somebody else is going out. So that there would be somebody there with the kids. Um hmm, go on. She's employed by this lordship and a ladyship. And this Mr. Evans she's talking to is trying to force her to do something wrong. Whatever it is, she doesn't want to do it, but she's afraid of Evans. Scared to death of him, because of some hold he's got over her. On the tenth, she's gonna meet this other girl, Mary... to get something from her and pass it to Evans. It could be this other girl is a nursemaid too, and that it's a plot to kidnap a child. Wait a minute Mr. Hannon. I know they have kidnappings in America, but they're very rare here. Ok, ok, then maybe it's a robbery. But it's something, something very wrong. Mr. Hannon, you'll forgive me for saying this, but you're a dramatist and a very skillful one. The way you've recorded that conversation is very dramatic and convincing. I don't think Mr. Hannon's likely to give a ham performance, Inspector. Thank you, Bob. Look Inspector, I've only recorded it the way they said it. Yes, but if you just take the words themselves, they could have a completely different meaning. Such as? Well... Supposing this girl is employed as you say, by a titled family. And supposing this man is just trying to entice her away to another job and with an offer of higher money. "More money than in last job." How about "hand over to us later"? - Well then, hmm. - Sorry. It could be a temporary job. The girl Mary is leaving and they want somebody to take over for her temporarily. But she says "It's dirty, letting people down who are trusting her?" Well that could be her present employer. She might not like herself being enticed away for money? Oh, one of those old-fashioned servants we read about. Then why did Evans threaten her? I didn't hear that he actually did threaten her. But isn't it quite possible that he did during that part I didn't hear? Quite possible. Look, Inspector, it seems to me, you not only think I'm blind, but crazy. I told you it's my business to know how people talk, what they're thinking when they say things. And I tell you that girl was scared. No one's that scared just because someone suggests changing a job. Oh, Mr. Hannon, you may very well be right. We're very obliged to you for getting in touch with us so promptly. Well somebody has to act promptly, because whatever it is, it's set for the tenth. Which is just one week from today. Well, what are you going to do? We haven't got a lot to go on Mr. Hannon, but we shall make inquiries. And if in the mean time you should recall anything further, All I know is on that tape. And you're welcome to play it through at any time. Well thank you, Mr. Hannon. We may take advantage of that. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Straining at the leash aren't they? Can't wait to get started. Where are we now? Just passing under Waterloo Bridge. Festival Hall, on the left. I never saw that. After my time. What's it like? Modern. What's that noise? Helicopter coming in to Waterloo air terminal. They won't do anything. Who? Those policemen. They think I'm making something out of nothing. Well, of course... Sure, sure. "Nothing to go on, possibly innocent conversation and so forth." But unless I'm going crazy, that girl was terrified. Maybe that's it. Maybe I am going crazy. Well, how does it look? Is it beautiful? Yes, yes, very beautiful. The view, the buildings. You make it all so vivid I can almost see it! Half past 5. The sun must be just going down ahead of us. Any barges coming down? Yes. Two lots. I know. And the river is gold now with the sun on it like that. The barges black against the gold. A slight wind that makes the water glitter, so that it slaps and dances against the side of the boat. Wait a minute! Wait a minute. What's up? That perfume. That's it, I've got it! Jean? Yes, Phil? Jean there's something I want to ask you: Do you remember back home 3 years ago, we were out in a rowboat somewhere? Yes, we were on Lake Cayuga, driving through Ithaca. That's right. I was rowing, and it was hot, and you wiped my forehead with a handkerchief. Yes. There was perfume on the handkerchief, a perfume you used quite a lot then. Do you remember what it was? Yes. It was Plaisir d'Amour. Do you still use it? No. I haven't used it for almost two years. It's too expensive. It is expensive? About the most expensive there is. Why? Well that woman yesterday was using it. I got a whiff of it as she passed me. Will somebody please tell me what kind of nursemaid uses just about the most expensive perfume there is? She might have been given it by the master. I mean that sort of thing still goes on you know. Always will. Or she may have stolen it from her mistress. No, no. A servant could steal money or clothes or almost anything and get away with it. But if she steals her perfume, she's giving herself away every time she comes into a room. That's true Phil, that's very true. The frightened nursemaid who uses expensive perfume. What does that add up to? Maybe it's on that tape? "I don't want anything to do with it, Mr. Evans. I don't like the sound of it." "Oh, you'll like the money, alright. And it'll be more than this last job." Miss Lennox, I put it to you. Here's a conversation that might have meant almost anything... between two people who might have been almost anybody. Where can I go from that? Well it's Mr. Hannon, I'm thinking of, Inspector. You see, this is the first real thing that's brought him to life in a long time. The question is, how real is this? It's very important to Mr. Hannon. Miss Lennox, I understand your concern, and I sympathize... but what you need is a psychiatrist, not a police officer. Well, yes, you're right, Inspector, and I have no business taking up your time like this. But I, well I thought if you could call him up and tell him... Tell him what? Well, that you were interested, and that you were working on it. Miss Lennox, I give you my word that If anything comes of this, or even looks like coming out of it, I'll get on to Mr. Hannon at once. And be pleased to. Thank you. "And then you will take the money and forget it. But it's dirty somehow, and people are trusting you." "Would you like me to say a little prayer?" "You promised when I went to his Lordship, that was the last thing." Jean? Yes, Phil? Well did they see you? Right away. Are they getting anywhere? Oh they're working like demons! They've been interviewing the barmaid and checking to see if they have anyone like Evans in they're records... and they've got a man watching The Eagle just in case those two should come back there... and they've got another man... Bravo! An excellent performance, but you know perfectly well, they're not doing a thing. They've just filed it under "C" for crackpot. Bob, is 73 a bus or a tram? A bus. Where does it go? Oh a long way. I can't remember where it ends, but it goes along Oxford St down Park Lane and along Knightsbridge. Phil? She was going back to her job, wasn't she? That's what she said. And her job was with somebody with a title? A peer, because of "His Lordship". Not a Knight or a Baronette. And "Her Ladyship" was going to a concert. That's right. How many lords are there, Bob? - Including or excluding the Irish period? - I don't care. I don't know. Well how ever many there are, there can't be so many that live in London, on one particular bus route and have children of nursery age. And wives who went to a concert last night. Bob, there's a book for lords, isn't there? There's Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage of the United Kingdom. We've got one here. Oh, here's one - Baron Yalding of Hayle, H-A-Y-L-E. Two sons, one daughter. Heir, born 1949. Address - 46 Link Court, Knightsbridge. Telephone, Avenue 7473. Well, I think that's all the possibles. Well there's a Baron Zwemmer in Park Lane but I don't think he's got any young children of nursery age. Well how old is he? 78, and never been married. Still... Well, I think we can safely leave him out. How many? Twenty. Ok. Well now what we want is one whose wife went to a concert. Let's start calling them up. We can't now. It's two o'clock in the morning. And I don't know about you two, but I'm exhausted. I'm sorry. You must be. I wasn't thinking. Bob, call Miss Lennox a taxi, would you? Certainly. Phil, is it alright if I come back tomorrow? I really am interested. Sure. Bob and I will start on these phone calls first thing in the morning. I'll see you then. Good. Well, good night. Good night, Jean. Thanks for your help. That's alright. No, I'm afraid Your Ladyship is misunderstanding me. I am not giving a concert. I mean, I couldn't. It's just that I understood that you went to a concert on Tuesday. Oh, I see. I must have been misinformed. I'm sorry I bothered you, Your Ladyship. No go. She says she never goes to concerts. She doesn't sound sound the slightest bit musical. Sobey. Hello? Can I speak to Lady Sobey, please? I'm speaking for... Oh, oh really? I didn't know Th... yes, I see. I'm sorry to have troubled you. Deceased. Before or after the concert? Two months ago. Alright, how many's that? Seventeen. Next, Lady Syrett. You stay with the phone, I'll get the door. Mayfair... one... two... oh... oh... - We're making the calls now. - Oh, good. Hello? Could I speak to Lady Syrett, please. I'm speaking for Mr. Phillip Hannon. Yes. Hello? Lady Syrett? Good afternoon, Your Ladyship. I tried to get you on Tuesday evening but I believe you were at a concert. You were? I see! I'm speaking for Mr. Phillip Hannon, the playwright. Yes, that's the one. Mr. Hannon wonders whether if he could come over and see you sometime. There's a small matter on which he wanted your help. - Some more tea? - No, thank you. Another cake? No thank you. I can't tell you how exciting it is for me, having a famous playwright here for tea with me. Especially as I've been trying desperately to get tickets for your play, but I've had no luck at all. Well if you'll allow me Lady Syrett, I'll be happy to leave my tickets for you at the box office any night you say. Oh that is kind of you Mr. Hannon, and I do appreciate it. Lady Syrett, you must think this very odd, our asking to come to see you like this. Oh, don't give it a thought. If one couldn't look forward to odd things happening... no one would want to get up in the mornings at all, would they? No, I suppose not. But... But you see this is kind of... Oh, just one thing. Could you possibly make it 4 tickets for this Saturday? Oh yes, of course. Make a note of that, Bob. We're dining with some old friends of my husbands, the Belmont's that are a frightfully dreary couple. They're Bird-watchers, you know. Of course I don't mind them watching, but they talk about it endlessly. And it just occurred to me that it would be a marvelous way to get through the evening. Oh, now, where were we? I was about to ask you a question. Oh yes, please. Please do. Well, it's a very small matter, but some friends of mine heard that your children's nurse... oh, I've forgotten her name... Janet Murch. That's it, Janet Murch, that she might be leaving. My friends understood she's a very good nurse. Oh she is perfectly marvelous. That's why I'm so annoyed with her. Pardon me, Lady Syrett? I got lost in there somewhere. Oh it's quite simple really. You see these are not my children, they're my Grandchildren. So Miss Murch walking out on me like this just has me at my wits' end. Did Janet Murch give you any reason for leaving? Yes, indeed. She just took another position if you please. She said she was starting on the tenth. I called the agency that sent her to me and complained bitterly, but I got no satisfaction. Which agency? The Unity Domestic Bureau. Well, thank you Lady Syrett, we've taken up enough of your time. Oh not at all. I've enjoyed it. Would you mind if I asked you a funny sort of question? Of course not! Do you ever use a perfume called Plaisir d'Amour? No, Mr. Hannon. Ought I to? No, not while you're using that charming Bal des Fleurs you have on now. Thank you again, Lady Syrett. Not at all. - Good bye - Good bye. Did you get that address, Bob? The Unity Domestic Bureau. Janet Murch... I did. Janet Murch? Yes. Janet Murch. I seem to recall the name. I'm sure we must have placed her sometime. Now, let me see. Ah, here we are. She's with Lady Syrett, in Brook St. Well no, she's just left there. That's why I thought I might be able to get her. Left there, well, well, She's only been there a few months too. I'm terribly anxious to get Miss Murch. I wonder if I might have her home address? Let me see, Janet Murch's home address. I'm very sorry, madam. As I said, I'm very sorry, but we can't do that. After all it wouldn't be very good business now would it now? I mean you could get in touch with the girl yourself and then we'd lose our commission. I'll look after this lady Miss Maston. Would you come in? I'm dreadfully sorry, Mr. Pillings. I didn't think. No, of course you didn't. Have this chair. Thank you. Well know, I understand you're looking for a nursemaid? Well, yes... We've got some very good girls in our books. Well, as I told your assistant, I particularly wanted Janet Murch. Because she's been so highly recommended by Lady Syrett. Oh, we've got several others just as good, if not better. Let me just have a look, hmm? Ah yes, now here's a very excellent Scotch lass named MacDonald. Very good recommendations, too. Well, thank you very much. I'll think it over and let you know. I see, in that case Madam, perhaps I'd just better have your address. You never know, Janet Murch might come in, or perhaps if not, we can find you somebody else. It's a Mrs.? Mrs. Jean Lennox. Jean Lennox... 603 Regent Court, Portman Sq, W1. Portman Square, W1. Telephone? Arcade 6549. Arcade 6549. Mrs. Jean Lennox. Thank you very much. Good day, madam. Thank you. I'm sorry, Mr. Pillings. I didn't know, really. No one told me. Well, go on, go on. Well, he was very tall, almost 6 feet, so I don't think he could be Evans. What sort of voice did he have? Smooth and oily. He was very positive. Did he wheeze when he breathed? Well if he did, I didn't hear it. I'm afraid that's a blind alley, Phil. I mean the agency did look genuine. And after all even if Janet Murch is your girl, there's no reason the agency should be in on it. No. Maybe not. I'm sorry, Madam. 603, please. 603. Sixth floor. That's Mr. Hannon. Hannon? The name I have got here is Lennox. Well, 603 is Mr. Hannon, ma'am. 603, Right there, ma'am. Thank you. Excuse me. Does Mrs. Lennox live here? I'm from the Unity Domestic Bureau, it's about the situation. I see. Can I have your name, please? Alice MacDonald. Alright, I'll just see if Miss... Mrs. Lennox is in. Won't you come in please. Excuse me one moment. Alice MacDonald. That's the girl they tried to sell me. How did she find you here? Well, I gave this address because I thought if they got a hold of Murch... Ok, ok. Bob, you take her into the living room. Jean, you keep her talking because I want to listen. Tell her that you are making these arrangements for me. That my family is coming over from America. Get it? Yes. Ok. I'll wait in here. I don't want her to know I can't see. Oh, good afternoon. Good afternoon, Madam. Won't you sit down? Well, thank you. I hope I've come to the right place. Only the Bureau said Mrs. Lennox. But the lift man said Mr. Hannon. Well, yes. I'm Mrs. Lennox, and I was inquiring not for myself, but for Mr. Hannon, who lives here. Oh, I see. You see, Mr. Hannon's family may be coming over from America soon. And if they do, they'll need a nurse. Yes, Madam. Only the Bureau said there was someone else you particularly wanted, but if you couldn't get her perhaps I would do. Someone called Janet Murch was recommended to me. You don't happen to know her? Murch? No, Sir, I don't. Only the Bureau said to show you my references. Thank you. I'll take them. Oh my, these are very good. Here, Phil, have look at them. They're really very impressive aren't they? Yes, very. Well thank you very much, but as I said, Mr. Hannon's plans aren't quite definite yet. If he does need a nurse, we'll call you. If you'd like to leave your address... Oh, you can always reach me through the Bureau. - Good afternoon, Madam. - Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Bob, go after that girl. Don't lose sight of her. Find out where she lives, and if you can, get a picture of her. Picture, what on earth for? She might be Murch, the barmaid seen her, Lady Syrett has seen her. Now hurry up, you'll lose her. How will I get a photograph? With a camera, you idiot. Hurry! Camera, of course. Well, did you smell it? No. What? Did you hear it? Well, what? Oh, you people with eyes. You're so busy looking you never notice anything. She smelled of that perfume. And that Scotch accent of hers, that was pure vaudeville. Then you really think she was Murch? She could be. It isn't the right sort of voice, but people can do things with their voices. Follow that bus. Hey! What about the money? No! Go on. Keep the change. May I interest you in a new cleaner, madam? It's absolutely marvelous. It cleans all the spots right away. May I show you? Look. It's absolutely wonderful. Oh, here! - Thank you. Yes, very well Sir. - Now where do I go with this? - Over there Sir, just by the haberdashery. Good day, Sir. £3.10s - is that right? Three pounds ten shillings, Sir. Here, and ready for use? Ready for immediate use, Sir. Shall I wrap it up for you Sir? No, no I'll take it just as it is. Very good, Sir. Please! I'm in a hurry. Here we are! Ham and eggs, country style. Toast and butter is on the left, coffee on the right. And a very pretty girl directly opposite me. Well, thank you, Sir. It's just like old times, isn't it, Phil? It's certainly like old something! Alright you marry me and I promise you faithfully I'll give up cooking. That's the most refreshing proposal I've ever had. I'll have you know I don't go around just proposing to anybody. I've only proposed twice in my life, both times to the same man. I know, Jean. I wish I could see it your way, but I can't. Well eat your dinner. It'll get cold. Hello, Bob. Hello. Well did you get anything? Yes. Pneumonia! You're wet. I can smell that tweed suit over here. Yes, It's the rain you know. It makes you wet if you stand out in it for hours on end. Without a coat. Well, where did she go? First of all she went into Barker's in Kensington. Where she bought something. Well, What? Well, I don't know. I was busy buying the camera. Her parcel was a long one, about two feet long. She came out of Barker's... rain started. Took a bus to Hammersmith. Still raining. Looked in a chemist's window, went into chemist's, came out again. Raining. Went into a cafe, had a cup of tea and one bun. Or it could have been one tart. The view was obscured with the rain on the window. Went into chain store, walked around store. Walked around store again, came out... Excuse me, it's a bit smudged here. Oh, yes, I see - raining heavily. Do you want me to go on? There's a lot more like that. Just like that. But did you find out where she lives? I don't believe that she has a home. If she has, she despises it. She wouldn't be caught dead in it. She fast prefers to wander around the streets. But you must have left her some place. Excuse me Mr. Hannon, there is no "must" about it. As a matter of fact, she left me. Oh no. I followed her to a building. 224 Stoner Street. She went inside. I waited outside. I waited and waited and waited. After three hours, I began to think things looked a little bit fishy, so I went inside. It was an empty sort of warehouse. No sign of MacDonald. But do you think she ducked you deliberately? Oh, I don't know. There were at least four perfectly reasonable exits back and side that she could have used. Well, that certainly was a dead end street. Well, never mind, Bob. I think you did very well. Here. Have a cup of hot coffee. Oh, thank you. Anyhow, I got her photograph. You did? Uh-hmm. Except that I'm not quite sure that I turned the film on properly. No Mr. Hannon, no. This isn't Janet Murch. But is it anything like her? Not at all. This girl is a bit older and quite different. Have you ever seen this girl in the photograph? No, never that I can think of. You're sure it's not just a bad photograph? It's a very good photograph taken in conditions of extreme difficulty. I have a feeling there is something perfectly fascinating going on. I do wish you'd tell me what it is. I wish I could too. But frankly, Lady Syrett, I can't explain it even to myself. Just now. Oh. Well, if you ever feel you can, please call me. It'll make my dinner table conversation for six months. I never have anything to say. Well, thank you again, Lady Syrett. Thank you. She's got no right not to be Murch. She even smelled right. And you can't tell me it's just coincidence, Two nursemaids using the same expensive perfume. Frankly, Mr. Hannon, I didn't smell it. You? I could cook fish and chips under your nose and you'd never smell it! When I first met McDonald, I didn't have a cold. She was the cause of my catching it. Smells are very tricky, Phil. If you have a certain scent in mind, you can always make yourself believe you can smell it. That's perfectly true. I can always smell escaping gas whenever I... give my mind to it. What are you two trying to tell me? That I've invented this out of hole cloth? Well, of course not. Because if that's what you think, will you both please stop humoring me! Stop treating me as if I was some child, whom you had to keep amused with a game of "Let's Play Detective." Drive Miss Lennox home, would you please, Bob? Never mind, Bob. You go on up with him. I'll get a taxi. "You go down and meet her and take over." "Then we take it off your hands and give you your money." And you go on a. Who's that? Why didn't you take Jean home? She took a taxi. She thought you shouldn't be alone. Now I need a nursemaid. "... nice long holiday," "What is simpler than that?" "But you don't understand. I might get to like it." "You won't have time for that, my dear." "No, Mr. Evans, no. I won't do it. I won't." It's no good, Mr. Evans. I'm after you. Sure I know it's unreasonable. But I'm not a reasonable man. If MacDonald isn't Murch, and you're not the guy at the agency... Who is Murch? Lady Syrett? And who are you Mr. Evans? And who are you, Mr. Evans? Dicky Dight, show a light Or else the dogs can't follow! Or else the dogs can't follow. Follow! - Did you call, Mr. Hannon? - No, no I sang. Bob, I want to put an advertisement in the newspapers. - Which ones? - All of them. "If Janet Murch is in need of help or advice will she call Arcade 6549." - That's our number. - I know. "Strictest confidence." Oh Bob, how on earth could you let him do this? I told you this morning, I didn't think. Think, what? I've just read this ridiculous advertisement of yours. When did you start reading classified ads? Well, I talked to Bob this morning, and he told me what you'd done. Do you realise what you are setting yourself up for? Of course. I'm trying to find Janet Murch. And Evans, particularly Evans. But don't you realize that you're telling whoever they are that you know something? And you're telling them where to find you. Phil, this is the last thing in the world I want to say to you, but you've got to face it. You can't afford to get mixed up in any violence. Hello? Arcade 6549. Mr. Hannon's apartment. Oh. Yes. It's a woman. She says she's Janet Murch. Give me that phone. You get on the extension, and take a tape of us. It's Ok. - This is Phillip Hannon speaking. - "Hello, what's the good news?" Is this Miss Janet Murch? "That's right, Janet Murch. You want to contact me, and I want to contact you, honey." "Do I need help and advice? I certainly do!" Where are you speaking from? From the bar docks. Best bar in London. Why don't you come down and have one? Well whoever that was, it wasn't Janet Murch. Just a drunk who read the advertisement and rang up for fun. Well I rung. It's a bloke called Phillip Hannon, if that means anything to you/ Hmm? Now look. You don't have to be concerned about me. There are day and night porters, downstairs, there are two locks and a chain on the door, and I've got Bob. I'm defended like Fort Knox. What about you? Me? Well, you're in this you know. You went to the agency, and if the agency is in it, they'll be looking for you too. And you live by yourself. Oh, nonsense, Phil. What do you mean nonsense? Don't you live by yourself? Yes, but... I don't want you alone in that apartment for the next few days. Bob, get Miss Lennox some rooms in a hotel. Now look, if you think I'm gonna move out of a perfectly good apartment, - for some lousy hotel. - Take her along, Bob. A reasonably nice hotel, maybe even a private bath. You always were the most impossible man. - Goodbye, Jean. - Goodbye, Phil. Who is it? It's me, deary. Elsie Schuyler. Oh, just a moment. Oh, Janet luv, I have to go out. Would you be a dear and take care for Pokey for me? I'd take her with me but it's a seance and Madame Pavio's medium doesn't get on with Pokey at all. Well I was just going out. Oh, dear. But only to make a phone call. I'll be back in a few minutes. Oh, Janet, you are a duck. I'll wait for you. "Hello, hello?" Arcade 6549... - You said to contact you. - Yes. This is Janet Murch, isn't it? Yes. I recognise your voice. Well, never mind about that now. This is Phillip Hannon speaking. I inserted the advertisement. It said to contact you. That's right. I want to talk to you. Can you come here? "No. I can't leave home." Where are you speaking from? "From my home. I can't leave here, but if you could meet my father, he'd bring you." Can he come over here? 813 Regent Court, Portman Square. "No, but anywhere else you say." But why not here? "Someone might see." Alright. Do you know a pub called The Eagle, near here? Yes. I'll meet your father there, now. It'll only take me a few minutes. "No, no, not now. In an hour would be better." Alright, I'll be there. Goodbye. No, I'm sorry, Sir. He doesn't seem to answer. Can I take a message for you? Oh, Alright, Sir. Simmons, would you mind taking a message for Mr. Mathews? Not at all Mr. Hannon. Tell him I've had a telephone call, and that I've gone to The Eagle. Ask him to follow at once. Alright Sir. - Oh, I'm so sorry! - I beg your pardon! Where is this, Governor? Why you're on the north side of Portman Square. Well where's Baker Street? It's just 23 paces behind you. Here, take my arm, I'll show you. Thanks. It sort of mists up my spectacles and I can't see anymore than if I'd got my head in a bucket. It must be a great handicap, having to wear glasses! Well, here's a brave man. Oh, it's you, dear! Good evening. Straight Scotch, no ice, isn't it? Yes. Do you know, I think you're wonderful the way you get about. If you hadn't told me, I should have ever know that you... I suppose you sort of get used to it? Don't ever believe that. You get so there are some things that you can do, but you never get used to it. Is there anybody here? Not a soul, dear. No one's coming out on a night like this, Even to get to the water hole. - I wonder if you'd help me? - Of course! I'm expecting to meet somebody here - should be a middle-aged man. Take a good look at him and see if he's the same one I asked you about the other day. And get him talking, I want to hear his voice. If he is the same one, cough. But I told you I didn't get a good look at him. Well if he's anything like the one you remember, cough. Alright. If you cough, I'll go, and you say "Good night, Mr. Doyle." Otherwise, come over and give me a drink. If I think it's the same man I cough, and say "Good night, Mr. Doyle." Okay, dear. Now, tell me exactly where the pinball machine is. Yes, over there, on the right. No, a little this way. That's it. You've been very kind. You see, I particularly don't want him to know about my eyes. Don't you now? No. All right, ducks, whatever you say. Thanks. - Good evening. - Evening. Half o' mild, please. Yes, Sir. Here you are, Sir. Thank you, ma'am. - What a night, eh? - Ah, it is that. You can't see a hand before yer face. You remember the bad fog we had in the war? I reckon this is thicker. Oh, thank you. I don't think he's the same one. He looks quite a respectable little cuft. Stand in front of him and talk, so I'll know where he is. He's on the third stool from the door. Well, I certainly didn't expect to see any customers out tonight, and here I am with two. Well sometimes people have to go out even in a fog. Good evening. Nasty night, isn't it? It is that, Sir. It makes everybody late for things. - Your not by any chance, Mr. Hannon? - Yes, I am. I'm Mr. Murch. Let's sit down to a table. Well... er... I'll take your drink over for you, ducks. Here's a nice table. How's that? Okay, dear? Thanks. Good evening, Sir. Oh, Mr. Mathews, I've got a... And not a word can I get out of her, except that she wants to see you. But there's something not right, Sir, not right at all, and not been for a long time. Has she ever mentioned a man named Evans to you? Evans? No, no never mentioned that name nor any other. I tell you, she's been that close. Well... Cheers! Cheers. How long ago did Mr. Hannon leave? About 20 minutes ago, Mr. Matthews. It's only a little bit of a distance. Do you mind if I take your arm? I'm not used to these fogs. Why of course, Sir. Though it seems to have thinned out considerably. Yes, it has. Sharp round here to the left. He went out of that door, yes, and he turned right round to the left and he was with another man. Thank you very much. Thank you. This is it. Here we are, now. Watch your step. Take care, Sir. Just a minute, Sir, now while I switch on the light. Ah, that's better. Now we can see what we're doing. Now will you come upstairs? I'm afraid it's rather a climb. We're right up at the top. Careful, now. Careful. Take a foot. There we are. It's a long climb, isn't it? It's not much of a place, Sir, as you see. Here we are now. Now, I'll take you in and then I'll leave you together because she won't talk if I'm there. Come in, Sir. Mr. Murch? Mr. Murch? Anybody here? Mr. Hannon? Mr. Hannon? Where are you? Bob! Up here, up high. Mr. Hannon! Stay where you are! Don't move! Don't move till I get to you. What's the matter? Man up there. Come on. Follow me! - Mr. Hannon! Mr. Hannon! - Bob, I'm in here! Are you alright? I'm alright, just get me out of here. You're alright now. Where am I? What is this? It's a bombed building. The whole front is missing. One more step and I would have been missing too. - Hello, Joe. Filthy night, isn't it? - It is that, Mr. Pillings. Well, did you see Mr. Hannon? Yes, Mr. Pillings. And it's all done. That's good news, Joe. Very good news indeed. It will save everybody a lot of trouble. Hello? Yes. Joe's just come in... He says Mr. Hannon won't be needing a nursemaid any more. Yes, I will. Bye. He says to tell you, "Very well done, Joe." Thank you, Mr. Pillings. Would you like some tea, Joe? No thank you, Mr. Pillings. Not now, I find if I drink tea at night it keeps me awake. Thanks, Jean. Phil? I want you to promise me that you'll never do that again. Well it isn't the sort of thing folks do do again, is it? You know, Jean, the strangest thing happened to me out there on that ledge. I thought I didn't care about living any more, but I was wrong. I found that out when I came right to it. I cared desperately. Do you know what I'm trying to say, Jean? Yes, Phil. Only don't get yourself killed proving you want to live. Excuse me, Mr. Hannon, Inspector Grovening and detective Sargent Luce are here. Oh, are they? Well show them in. Won't you come in please, Inspector. Morning, Mr. Hannon. Hello, Inspector. I'm told you've been having some adventures, Mr. Hannon. Adventures? No. If you have a dramatic mind, you might think someone had tried to break my neck. But I'll bet there's a perfectly innocent explanation for that. Mr. Hannon, according to the barmaid at The Eagle, you were expecting this man. Why were you meeting him? Did you know who he was? No. But I knew who he wasn't. He wasn't Evans. Outside of that, I only knew what he called himself. The father of a girl named Janet Murch. I see... You've been making inquiries for her, haven't you? Advertising and so on? That's right inspector. What was your interest in Janet Murch, Mr. Hannon? She was the girl I heard in the bar. And you contacted her? Yes. I spoke to her on the telephone last night. Inspector, you have to find Murch, and you have to find her fast. Mr. Hannon, Janet Murch may have been associated with criminals as you thought, though that's by no means certain. But there's one thing that is certain: Whatever anybody was asking her to do, tonight or tomorrow, Her body was taken out of the river early this morning. - She was murdered? - Yes. A nasty job with a knife. And what's more, I'm responsible. You, responsible? Yes, with that advertisement. She saw the advertisement but so did Evans. And Evans knew I was on to something through her. So he murdered her. And then tried to have me murdered too. I killed that poor kid as surely as if I'd shot her. Inspector, we have to get Evans. And we have to get him before tomorrow. Mr. Hannon, as I told you before... But it's starting Inspector! It's the ninth today, it's happening somewhere out there, now! You must remember, Mr. Hannon, there are nine million people out there. Nine million. And none of us have ever seen Evans, and only you have even heard him. This morning he seem to prefer whiskey to scrambled eggs. Well, if it helps him get through today, I'm all for it. So am I, but it seems to have no more effect on him than milk on a baby. I'll go see what I can do. Does he know I stayed here last night? He knows that today is the tenth. That's all he knows. "This is all you've got to do." "Mary arrives on the tenth." Jean? Yes, Phil. Well, you didn't just come in? No, I stayed here last night. Stayed here? Yes, in your spare room. Well, I hope you were comfortable. Can I fix you one? Phil, at ten o'clock in the morning? At ten o'clock in the morning, and at half past ten, on the tenth hour of the tenth day. Let's drink to that. You don't mind that I stayed here? Bob has to go out occasionally, And you felt there was a job for an assistant keeper. Well, the facts support that. It seems I can't get off the string, without nearly getting myself killed... and other people, quite killed. But you didn't know. I didn't know Evans was that desperate. Well how could you? "You go down to meet her and take over. Then we take it off your hands, and give you your money". "And you go on a nice..." Why do you keep playing that thing over and over again? You must know it by heart. I knew it by heart to start with. But you can know your words without knowing what they mean. Somewhere that thing is trying to tell me about Evans. Who he is, and what it is he's gonna do today. But I can't seem to hear it and the rest of you can only see. "You wouldn't." "No, my dear, I wouldn't do that. Not just as long as you do as you're told." "Now come on, pull yourself together: There's nothing to cry about." Alright, Mr. Evans, you win. Jean, are you over by the window? Yes. Is it still foggy? A little. It's almost clear now. What do you see? You know, Phil. You told me the first time I came here. That's right. Houses of Parliament, Big Ben, Charing Cross Station... Station... I wonder if Mary would be arriving at a station? What train would she be on? A suburban train? A boat train? What's that? A boat on the river? Yes. Why is he sounding it if it isn't foggy? They often do. That's right. Leaving or arriving, and so forth. I remember the time I was coming over on the Queen Mary... Mary. "Mary on the 10th!" Bob! Bob! Bob! Phil! Sir? Find out when the Queen Mary arrives. Queen Mary? Yes, and hurry! - Why? - Don't you get it? It was then, when that pinball machine made all the racket. I missed a bit there. I heard it as "Mary arrives." But it could have been "The Queen Mary arrives". And "You go down to meet her" could have been, down to meet her at Southampton. And she's not a girl, but a ship. They were taking Janet Murch down to meet somebody off that boat. Hello? I want some information please. Can you tell me what time the Queen Mary docked at Southhampton? Well, have you got em? Thank you, thank you. Hold on a moment please. The Queen Mary docked at 6 'o'clock this morning. The boat train should have arrived in London, just after ten. What time is it now? It's 10.30. Alright, look. Get her passenger list. Find out what rich, first-class passengers are traveling with children. And get after that fireball policeman. Yes. Well, thank you very much indeed. I'm sorry to have bothered you. Goodbye. Well, that crosses them off. Now that's Mr. and Mrs. Richard Avery, from Houston, Texas. With two children, they brought their own nurse with them. Isn't there one more? Yes, the Argentinians, the Da Mestres. Ah yes, the Da Mestres. We haven't been able get a hold of them yet. They've taken a flat in Kensington. Anyhow, the daughter there is 17. They'd hardly need a nurse for her, would they? Still, we'll go on try and find them, Mr. Hannon. To be on the safe side. I hope you're wrong, Mr. Hannon. Inspector, I don't want to be right. I'm just scared sick that I might be. I don't know if it's nerves or the cold, but I'm freezing to death. I'm sorry. There's a blanket back here somewhere. Here we are. - There, that better? - Thank you. They seem to be taking forever up there. It's only been ten minutes. They know what they are doing. They're just active. They don't know what they're doing. A 17-year-old girl wouldn't need a nursemaid. I'm completely lost. I can't figure it. What's that! What happened? I think it's Mrs. Da Mestre. I want you to cover all the gates in the gardens. We're looking for a 17-year-old girl in a wheelchair. With a nursemaid, wearing white uniform, black shoes, dark blue cape and cap. - Hurry. - Right, Sir. She's an invalid? Well, her father told me, that she's a child who never grew up. They keep her with them, always. Those poor people. - Jean? - Yes? Any luck? No. Phil, don't you think we go ought to go home? It's getting awfully cold. No. I'm not an awful lot of use, but I want to stick around, just in case. - I think they've found something. - Take me over! There's a fence here. Get some lights up to cover this area. Won't be a minute, Sir. Hello Mr. Hannon. Good evening, Inspector. What did they find? It's an invalid chair, the upright kind. I think it'll come down so that you can lie flat in it. Anything in it? Yes, a robe, and a pillow, and what do you call it? A golliwog. A what? Golliwog. I don't think we have them in America. There kind of a soft doll with a black face. A soft doll? Yes. It's a rather large one. Looks new. Inspector? What is it Mr. Hannon? The doll, could I please have it for a minute? What for? I just want to hold it. There won't be any fingerprints on it. Alright. Oh, thank you. Here you are. She went into the department store, in the toy department... and bought something. A package about two feet long. Inspector! Yes, Mr. Hannon? If you want to find the person that handled this last... and handled it quite a lot. I suggest you come with me to 224 Stoner Street. You mean MacDonald? I don't know who I mean by now, but you followed that perfume to Stoner street. But it's an empty house. Of course it is. If you kidnapped a child, where would you take it? To Claridges? Well, how about it Inspector? Are you willing to take another chance on one of my long shots? If so, we'd better hurry. Mr. Mathews, you know where this place is, you better come with us. Miss Lennox, will you drive Mr. Hannon home? Yes, of course, Inspector. But Evans may be at that place. You won't know him. Mr. Hannon, if you're right about this, you've seen more with no eyes than most of us with two. But things where things might get rough, and if they did, it's no place for you. I'm sorry. Come on. Well, I can't stand here all night. Where's the car? Straight ahead. Hello? We got them, Mr. Hannon. The child's there? Yes. She's a bit sleepy they've given her something, but she's quite alright. Look, the inspector wants to speak to you, hold on. Well, Mr. Hannon, I congratulate you. You were quite right. Have you got Evans? Well, there are two men, but we don't know which one is Evans yet. But one of them is an old friend of ours called, Teapot Charlie. He's had a good many different names at one time or another, and I dare say "Evans" is one of them. The other one answers pretty closely to the barmaid's description of your "Mr. Murch". Yeah, but how bout MacDonald? "Well there is a woman, but she's not the one Mathews followed." Not MacDonald? Well, that's funny. Oh, we've got the nets out for her, shouldn't take long to pick her up. I see. Any trouble? "No, no they came like lambs." Oh, then I wouldn't have been so much in the way after all would I, Inspector? Hello? Hello! Inspector? Hello? Hello? He's hung up. I'm afraid he's still pretty sore! Oh, there you are. I thought I'd lost you. Well congratulations... Not at all. You're welcome. Well, that appears to be that. Did they get them? Oh yes, yes. Inspector Grovening and the British police arrived in the nick of time. Will wonders never cease? Well, while you're sitting here in the dark moping, I'm gonna fix myself a drink. Help yourself, if you have anything to drink too. But personally, I think I'm gonna go to bed. Don't worry, I'll get out. Just as soon as I finish this drink I'll be gone. Here's to Phillip Hannon. It's no good congratulating him on a good job. All you get's a grunt. It's no good wishing him happiness, because he doesn't want it, and won't have it. He'd rather be lonely and tragic. It's no good wishing him luck. Because for him, all luck must be bad luck. So here's to Mr. Hannon, the man for whom something must always go wrong... or not be complete enough, so that he can sit and mope about it! To Mr. Hannon, who's so proud he won't let anybody help him... who doesn't want any help even if it's only to cross the street. Shall I call you a taxi? Or is there anything else you want to say? Well? Well, as soon as Bob comes, I'll go. Bob's on his way home now. There's nothing to stay for. No, I guess there isn't. Goodbye, Phil. Goodbye, Jean. Jean? Jean? Bob? Come in, Mr. Evans. We're equal now. Not afraid of the dark, are you? Come in, Mr. Evans. Come in, Mr. Evans. We're equal now. Not afraid of the dark, are you? Come in, Mr. Evans. Come in, Mr. Evans. Today is the tenth. I've been expecting you. Not afraid of the dark, are you? "Come in, Mr. Evans. We're equal now." "Not afraid of the dark, are you?" "Come in, Mr. Evans." "Come in, Mr. Evans. We're equal now. Not afraid of the dark, are you?" "Come in, Mr. Evans." "Come in Mr. Evans. Today..." "I've been expecting you." "Not afraid of the dark, are you?" "Come in, Mr. Evans, not afraid of the dark, are you?" You have to kill me Mr. Evans, I know too much! "Come in, Mr. Evans, come in Mr. Evans, today is the day. We're equal now..." "I've been expecting you... not afraid of the dark are you? Not afraid of the dark are you?" "Not afraid of the dark..." "Come in, Mr. Evans..." "We're equal... Come in Mr. Evans." Mr. Hannon! Mr. Hannon! Hannon! Mr. Hannon! Wait a minute, Bob! Are you hurt, Mr. Hannon? We heard the shots, what was it? Was it Evans? It was Evans alright, but I don't know. Come here. - It's a woman. - It's MacDonald. You mean that she, MacDonald and Evans are the same? Of course, I told you. She smelled right, and she sounded right. I should have thought of it long ago. But if two people go past you and you smell perfume, and your told one is a man, you naturally think that the perfume is on the other. I thought that till 3 minutes ago when I got hold of her slim wrist. She's dead? Yes. I'm sorry. Oh, you want another cup of coffee? No, thanks, Jean. Phil? There's one thing I want to know. What's that? When you sent me away last night, did you know that Evans was going to come here? I didn't know. I just thought maybe. The police were after a bunch of kidnappers, and I was after Evans. And Evans was after me, not knowing how much I knew, or how soon I would figure it out. Can you imagine that? Afraid of me, not of the police - me! And yet you sent me away. I had to, honey. Don't you see: I just had to get Evans. I couldn't go after him, so he had to come to me. Don't you see? Yes. But just the same, I think you should have... What sort of day is it? Foggy? No. It's clear now. Well, take me out on the roof and show me. Come on. Can't you lend a guy a helping hand who can't even see? Well, sure! What do you see? Well, it's just the same as you remember it. That's right. Just as I remember it.
