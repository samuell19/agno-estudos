It's a white man. Ain't no goddamn hammers down till we see empty hands, sir, no matter what the color is. I'm about done in. If you got food, water... Damn. Coming up on folks that way. I was fixin' to call out, but... Say, he's in a bad way. Don't make sense, stumbling in like he done. Somebody after him, I'd say. If he's on the run, that horse would be lathered up. But he was walking him. We'd best stand watches. We can sort it out come morning. We ain't seen no comanche sign for 3 days. Yeah, I know. Sounds all quiet out there, but... You reckon he'll make it till the morning? Well, if'n he do or he don't, US losing sleep ain't gonna change it. No. I'll look around. Be rousting you directly. You just gonna let him lay there? Well, he ain't bleeding nowheres I can see. Reckon he's just plumb wore out. Whoa, boy. Whoa, whoa. [Whinnies] Whoa, whoa. Calm down! You damn jackass! Whoa! Ho, boy! Easy now. Whoa. Easy. Good boy. Easy. He's ok now. I'll bed him down. I'll chew his damn ear off to bed him down real proper. No call for that. He's been shot. Well, I ain't shot him...Yet. Reckon that's why he's so skittish. Lookie here. They're long healed. Look at this one. Looks pretty fresh to me. Damned if I'm gonna stand--next time-- my granddaddy was with Andy Jackson at New Orleans. Got all shot up. He'd get pretty mean sometimes. Mama always said it was them old wounds, sticking him, galling him. That's a goddamn dumb-ass animal! Ain't no Andy Jackson! I wonder where he got him. I don't think he's moved since he fell down there. Well, he's still breathing. We'll get some of this down him. Maybe he oughta rest some more. Maybe he was snake bit or-- maybe he's got trouble on his trail, which we don't need no part of. You get it down him. Oh, look like he's coming 'round. Mister. We're pulling out. Goin' south. We're fixin' to give you some beans, maybe a little water. Horse. I need a horse. Well, you got yourself a horse. A fine horse. I can pay. I got... Oh, ain't nobody took nothin'. Just these here. Fine. I took the loads out so's you wouldn't hurt yourself. I got hard money. I'll pay $50 gold. Well, we ain't got no string, just what we's settin'. I'll swap. Give you $20 boot. I'll go 100. [Whinnies] [Whinnies] This here's a damn injun horse. You killed an injun and took him. It ain't. I swear it ain't. Lord know they on your trail. I ain't seen no Indian sign for 100 miles. Well, that's about when we seen 'em last, b.D. Maybe he's telling the truth. Well, if that don't beat all. You got a deal. Now hold on a minute. I'm making the swap here, b.D. If he stole that horse from a white man, that's even worse. It's my horse. I never knowed a man to have a horse he couldn't ride. It was a friend's. My partner, he died. And how was that? Stampede. Got all busted up. And you took his horse. What do you figure your partners to do if you was to be took off? You ain't worked no cows. Not with them there hands. I told you they's empty. I reckon it ain't hard to figure out what kind of work he does do. My name is virgilio segura. The law's been pushing me for a week clean through Texas. I've been out of food, water. I recollect there's a price on you. Virgilio: $500. I got about that much in my poke. Let me have a horse, some food-- why should we throw in with you when we can get the $500 legal? I don't rightly know. I don't much like selling a man, b.D. Not even for no $500. Well, split 3 ways... That'd be 2 years of pushing cows north. I don't know. He ain't never done me no hurt. We ain't the law, b.D. The law says you done a sight of killin'. Robbing banks and such. I reckon it's a fact. Jesus h.P.Q. Christ. They say you run with Billy the kid. We covered some ground together. They say that both of you'd shoot a man down quick as you'd look at him. I looked at the 3 of you sleeping peaceful last night. How close was you when that big red horse yelled out? Was you in range or not? Well, b.D., he does have a rifle in that boot. Virgilio: Well, friends. My posse will be along right soon. Make up your minds. They see US together, hard to tell what they might think. I'm swapping me for a horse and $20 to boot, b.D. I'm ready to head south. All right. That's the way of it, then. You give John t. Here the 20. We ain't your partners. I still want to buy some food. Well, I got some jerky I can spare. Here. Mmm. They're double eagles. Take one. Oh, no. That little bit of nothin' ain't worth no $20. Go on, take it. I'm obliged. No call to be. It's none of our affair what's 'twixt you and the law. I'm still obliged. Maybe we'll cross paths again... If I'm luckier than that posse. That's not likely, mister. We're taking different roads. Never know. Crooked road's apt to go anywhere. Crossing the straight and narrow like this time. Here's your double eagle, friend. I can't take no boot. Not for a horse like this. He's something. Right enough. Not if he's stole. Ain't nobody gonna be claiming that animal, amigo. Not in this world. I don't suppose you helped him on to the next. Sheriff named Garrett got him. New Mexico territory. You best not know no more. Adios, amigos. I'm gonna call him Jim. That was my granddad's name. He brought me up. B.d., you reckon that's Billy the kid's horse? He's my horse, Jim. Come on. Bad Jim. [Whinnies] Dang it. You prove anything? Well, I reckon not. You figure he'll go like that all the way to the bar "y"? I don't see why not. It's only a couple more hundred miles. C.j., these fellas are just up from the north. Well, now, good to see you boys. From the looks of your goods, you got a piece to go. Yes, sir. Carter valley. Yes, we do. Carter valley? I did some trailing years back. Never got over that way, though. Let's see. What do we got here? Them beans and that flour. $2.00 ought to cover it. That's all right. Make it $1.50. We're obliged, sir. Yes, sir. Come back again. Stop in next year, and watch your trail. How much is them peaches? $1.00 the can. $1.00 the can? It's the freight, son. Clean all the way from St. Louis. Makes 'em dear. I'll take 3 cans. 3 cans. [Distant rumbling] [Whinnies] Smell a lion, Jim? They come pretty big up here, I reckon. He don't smell no cat. I thought I heard something a bit ago. Thunder. No, it ain't thunder. We best take a look-see. [Men whooping] Oh, if that don't beat all. Acting like a bunch of wild young 'uns. My grandpappy told me the frenchies took it up. They called it lacrosse. What? Lacrosse or some such. That's what they call them sticks they's using. Growed men carrying on that a way. My grandpappy told me that they wager a sight of money on it. They're trying to get that teeny ball betwixt them little Poles. That's it. That ain't much. Well, as you can see, when you get another bunch figuring on stopping you, it can get to be considerable. Ooh, look at that big 'UN go. Look at that big 'UN go. He's gone about as far as he's goin'. [Laughing] We might as well call it a day. Plenty of firewood, water. Let's go on. B.d.: Ain't no call for no night riding. We's the first ones to hit the red as it is. Well, I don't feel like sleeping. B.d.: Well, I'm hungry. Well, I ain't. We ain't gonna find no better place. Nah. Horse shit and gunpowder. Well, I reckon I'll get them beans and biscuits going. I'm gonna get me some fresh meat. Oh, now, there's plenty of jerky here. Nah. I don't want no jerky. July: B.D. B.d.: Hmm? You reckon that's the kid's horse sure enough? It sure as hell was segura. Shh--Jesus Christ. [Gunshot] [B.d. Laughs] Sounds like he got himself that fresh meat. Mmm. Segura had $500 in his poke. He held it right in his hand. If we'd have took it, we'd have been going against the law. We let him go anyway. It wasn't the same. He didn't buy US off, John t. We ain't the law, John t. We ain't nothin'. No. You're a cow chaser, same as US. Ain't no way for it. Maybe not and maybe so. Christ on a mountain. Man don't have to start pulling a plow, you know? Selling shoes. Man could get a few head, a little place of his own. Somebody fixin' to die, are they? Leave you some property, John t.? All it takes is a few hundred. Tell me something, b.D. How long you been doing this here? 20 years, less 3 for the war. I ain't gonna be draggin' ass into Kansas when I'm 50. How much you done put aside? Well, I got my bonus coming. That's $30. And that clock. How much it worth? What, 15? It's valuable. Segura bought US these at least. $1.00 the can. Mmm. We hit laskey Springs before sundown. It ain't never dried out before August. I figure by tomorrow, the day after that, that ought to do it. Old bar "y" will look just fine, huh? Yes, sir. Just fine. I ain't going back. Son, you got your bonus pay waiting. You could do that like you said, get yourself a few head. That's a fact. Everybody ain't got to piss their pay away like b.D. Hell, no. I just never-- well, it's all right with me, somebody else being boss and all. Ain't nobody gonna die and leave me nothing, b.D. I'm just gonna go and take it, I reckon. Well, that's some talk now, John t. A man can't just up and change his calling. Some do. Segura did. He owns up a poke with $500 in it. That's a ranch he's holding. Jesus h. Let's get US a damn drink. We can't just stand here. It don't look like much. That town marshal, he don't look like much neither, but I don't believe they give him that badge just to keep his vest from a'floppin'. Gonna look a might different with a gun in his hand. Sure, you're right. Piano man: * good-night rhythm * right and bold * find your ear and grabs ahold * * no use struggling * you been beat * it's time to sing it with your feet * * sing it with your feet * sing it with your feet * sing it with your feet * music wants a pair of shoes * * and it don't seem to matter whose * * you been chosen * get out your seat * and start singing with your feet * * singing with your feet * singing with your feet * singing with your feet * yeah, sing * go on and serenade the floor * * come on, dance * yeah, that's what your feet are for * * well, now you got it * how you doing? * toes sure like a chance to croon * * so keep it simple, nice and sweet * * while you're singing with your feet * * singing with your feet * singing with your feet * singing with your feet * yeah * go on and sing it now we could walk right in there and take all they got. And what if they don't figure to give it to US? That could happen. That could happen, John t. Lookin' into 3 6-guns, they ain't gonna give US no trouble. And what if they do? What then? You fixin' to shoot somebody, John t., if it come down to it? They won't try nothing once we got the drop on them. All right. We get the money and we get out, what do you figure that marshal's gonna be doing? Hell, we'll be long gone before he knows anything about it. Yeah. Then we got the money, and we got the posse on our trail just like segura. B.d.: And then we run, and we don't stop running, you know? I didn't ask you to come. I'm just gonna do it. * life is sweet * why don't you sing it with your feet? * * singing with your feet * singing with your feet * singing with your feet * singing with your feet [applause] Hey, little bit. * how long has it been now? * forever * since I last saw her, Callie * * oh, Callie I don't much care about the money. But it ain't gonna happen the way you say, John t. Ain't no way we can figure it that way. Somebody in that bank or on that street gonna have a gun, and if they use it, what then? Somebody starts shooting at me, then I reckon I'll shoot back. I ain't never killed nobody... 'Cept in the war. Maybe some injuns. Well, I was in some range trouble once. A whole mess of shootin'. I reckon--yeah, I reckon maybe i-- somebody starts shooting at you, ain't much else a man can do, I don't reckon. Yeah, I reckon. Buy me a drink, boys? Or you could buy the bottle, and we can go upstairs and work on it. How much would it be, a bottle like that? Mmm. $5.00. How about that little lady over there by the piano? * oh, Callie * from the skies a'blazin' how much it be for her to fetch US up the bottle? You got $50, have you? 50? I'd give my right arm. No. Miss Callie don't take nothing but hard cash. 'Course, now, the mayor won't be in until later, and if you boys have got the $50... * now all by my lonesome * I've grown some * perhaps from knowing Callie * darlin' Callie * Callie, there's no more town marshal's Sam tillman, boys. You better give this another think. Our marshal's never had a holdup. You tell your marshal-- tell him Billy Bonney don't give a damn for no Sam tillman. Get them cash drawers! Stay nice and quiet, and we won't have no trouble. Somebody comin'. I don't allow how bill Bonney would give a damn about anything along about now. Pat Garrett done took care of that. You seen Billy the kid go down? Did you? The whole territory heard-- I don't want to hear no more. Segura, how we doing? [Spanish accent] We're cleaning 'em out, kid. The vault, get it open. We're gonna have the whole damn county in here. The vault. The marshal has the key in his office. You're a liar. No, I swear, it's the truth. That's how tillman runs his town. You picked the wrong place, son. Shut up. I don't want to hear no more talk. We got plenty, kid. Come on. He would not try to lie to you. Oh, no. There's a wagon pulling up out front. I swear to god, Mr. Bonney. All right, everybody against that far wall, and don't turn around. We'll be watching from outside. Move! Remember, stay put. We're watching. Marshal! Marshal! We've been robbed! Could've took the easy way around. Ain't nobody back there. You can see for 20 miles. Hey, I just got a goddamn feeling. Look, we got the money. Nobody got hurt. We're clear. That's all there is to it. Maybe we should head back west, get back to the bar "y" pretty near on schedule. Nobody would know. I told you, I'm done with that. I just mean that maybe we should lay low-- just keep on working like nothing happened. Nobody would know it was US. You can do as you please, but I'm done with it. Oh, John t., hellfire. I just meant that-- I'm going on with it until I get enough. Uh-huh. And when is that going to be? The way I figure, we got about 4, $500 apiece right now. A man can get himself a nice piece of land. And have the bankers robbing US with their mortgages and all? That makes a lot of sense. So you figuring to get enough to set up like the bar "y," is you? 10,000-- that's what I'm figuring. 10,000? Sure. The 3 of US, we could go partners. Wouldn't take long. It'd be kind of nice seeing cows get fat for our own pocket. You bet it would. We'd have to hire a few extra hands. Of course, we'd be working owners. [Laughs] I'd damn sure have them calling me "mister." [Laughs] Mister July. That's your given name, isn't it? Yeah. That's the only thing I got. Never had any other. That is, until now. Now that i'm a man of property, I reckon I better get me another name. July Coleman. That sounds fine. July Coleman. You sure--you sure that'd be all right, using your name and such? Hey, we're partners, ain't we? Sure. You right. I know you right. [Laughs] B.d.: Excuse me, boys. Before you brand all them cows, we best do US some fancy figuring. Why's that? Why? What's the matter? Look yonder. Right there, where we come from. I don't see nothing. What do you mean, you don't see nothing? Right under there, under that goddamn Ridge. Oh, come on, b.D. Ain't nothing but a dust devil. There's a devil in that dust, all right, wearing a goddamn marshal's badge. That ain't him. It can't be. We trailed through water, stayed on hard ground. And he's right behind US, straight as a string. It looks like he's got a good bunch with him, too. J.t.: It could be anything-- buffalo, Indian camp on the move. No way of telling it's him from here. Oh, yeah. Well, they're coming fast. You want to wait until we see the sun off of that badge? B.d.: God damn it. July: Well, I reckon he wasn't faking. That damn leg must've pulled. B.d.: Well, he's done for. You ok? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I felt him going down, kicked loose. Well, leave your gear. That damn beast won't let nobody sit on him but you. He'll do like I tell him. Come on. Ride double? We ain't got a prayer. We ain't leaving you here. Come on, you two get moving. I'll slow them down some. Not here--that rise. We'll never make that rise. They're too damn close. We'll make it. Come on, boy. Easy now. July, you take my horse. I'll stay here, make them back off a ways. There's no cover here. We got to make it to them rocks. Well, riding double thataway-- me and Jim will be there. You want to bet a hundred of your share that we won't be first? [Laughs] Well, goddamn. [Smacks lips] Come on. There ain't no horse that can run thataway. He's finished. Aw, he's still sound. There's a Ridge yonder ways. You want to lose another hundred? I ain't going to kill bird shit, but damned if I don't think he could go it. They even dropping back a ways. Let's get higher-- let the animals cool down, pick up some cover. They still coming. They ain't going to quit, and we ain't going to quit, neither. Gets kind of uncomplicated, don't it? Once the man's mind is made up. [Laughs] That must be tillman out in front on the gray. July: God damn his hide. He must not be over much, riding onto that Ridge-- perfect for setting a trap like it is. Likely they're figuring US to keep running. Well, they're figuring wrong. July: 8... 9... 9 to 3. Sam tillman--they seem to set great store in him. He ain't even slowing down, either. Well, with him out of the way, I don't allow them citizens will want to fool with it on their own. Damn him! Why don't he turn back? Why don't he look up here? Tillman! [Gunshot] [Bullet ricochets] Damn him. I got him. Did you see? I got him. He went down. 2 of them went down. We got to keep them out of the rocks. [Gunfire] They're quitting, John t. John t., they done had enough now. They're gone. We got the marshal. They'll think on it now. July: Yeah, I reckon. I reckon they'll call it off, get their wounded back to a doctor. A couple of them ain't moving. They're past doctoring, I allow. Well, we ain't even in his county no more. He didn't have no right crowding US. Well, there ain't no way for it now. Well, a couple of their horses is running loose. Likely as not we get a rope over one of them, huh? Well, I'll tend to it. Keep an eye on them for me. Get me that gray one. That marshal was riding that gray one, wasn't he? Yeah. We figured it to be him. Well, they still going. Reckon they don't want no more part of US. I reckon not. [Spins chamber of gun] You know, I reckon I hit one of them. You see that fella in that green coat with them 2 six-shooters? I think I hit him. Hard to tell-- all that shooting. Hard to tell. [Sighs] I'm sure you right, but I... I think I hit him. Damn store clerks and the like-- they ain't got no stomach for it. Clerks and cowhands. [Bird chirps] Ahh! Whoa, boy, whoa. Whoa. They ain't coming. We're shed of them. I'm sure you're right. They figured US to be headed to Oklahoma. Ha ha! Slipping over to new Mexico like we done. I ain't never been to new Mexico territory before. Well, I been to El Paso once. Well, I don't figure it much different, new Mexico. We could head south. I ain't never seen El Paso. Ain't much to see. I hear they got silver over around Santa fe. Now, I ain't never heard of that. A fella on a drive told me. Bring it in on them wagons, he said, from the mines. Guards on them wagons, I expect. He didn't say nothing about there being guards. Well, piss on the parade, if you had wagons full of silver... Oh, now, b.D., it wouldn't hurt to take a look at it now, huh? Well, I'd rather go after one wagon full of silver than 6 or 8 banks. There'll be goddamn guards on them goddamn wagons. All right, there will be. If there's wagons full of silver, we'll go after them. Guards or no guards? Like as not, we killed that marshal, so I don't reckon it makes no never mind no more. I don't suppose it does. Well? Which way is Santa fe? [Man singing in Spanish] [People chattering] [Singing in Spanish] Santa fe, wagons full of silver. Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. He told me he seen it with his own eyes. Denver. Now, if he'd of said Denver... Aw, he said Santa fe. Well, he's a goddamn liar. There's a bank. We didn't come all this way just to find a bank. It's just as well we did. Why's that? It's on the way to Denver, ain't it? Denver? Damn it, you said they had silver there, didn't you? I ain't talking to you no more. [Women laughing] One time and one wagon, then to Mexico, South America-- set up for good and all. You know, I hear... In South America, they throw iron balls at their cattle down there. [Song ends, applause] Denver. [New song begins] You got a better idea? Never did have ideas. Somebody always told me "do this" and "do that," and I just always done it. You know, no ideas. July: Well... It don't much matter to me, John t. Them is just... Just fine. [Speaking Spanish] Señores, my sister has a room. It's $5.00 for the night. You ain't got no sister. Oh, yes, señor. I have many sisters. You like that one over there? Maybe the fat one? I have a sister for all of you. 2, if you like to keep your back warm. I wouldn't warm my feet with any of that bunch. I have a sister at home, too. For you, señor, $10. She's not like the pigs here. Never mind. Go give your ma that dollar. My real sister, she's a virgin. I swear by our lady of Guadalupe. A virgin, huh? I swear by my dead father, by the big breasts of my mother, by the eyes of-- all right, all right. Before you swear US all straight into hell, fetch up a couple of pigs here for my friends. [Laughs] B.d.: Now where the hell is he going? Girlin'. I'm gone. Hey. [Laughs] [Water splashes] [Chicken clucks] Are my friends still at the cantina? Sí, señor. They eat some, they throw up some, then they eat some more. I don't reckon they got the same kind of cooking that I did. Oh, no. My sister Luz, she's only for the jefe. I really ain't the boss, beto. I know. When I care for the horses, I know. Tell your sister she's nice-- really nice. Sure. She likes you, too. She never liked any of the... I mean-- yeah, I know what you mean. Tell her... Tell her from me that she was a virgin. Sure. I tell her. Maybe I'll teach her some English, too. Next time, tell her yourself. Yeah, right. Next time. [Rock music begins] Jeff Scott soto singing: * cowboy * you've been ridin' for so long * * workin' hard to stay alive * * you're a dreamer * and your heart is on fire * * what will you do to survive? * * renegade * step into the night * follow * your heart * renegade * don't give up the fight * * cowboy * I see danger in your eyes * * like a spark from the sun * * what will you do in that moment * * when you find yourself under the gun? * * renegade * step into the night * follow * your heart * renegade * don't give up the fight * * it's the call of the wild * * like a wind * in your soul * once you ride * the crooked path * you can never * go home * renegade * step into the night * follow * your heart * renegade * don't give up the fight * * renegade * step into the night * follow * your heart * renegade * don't give up the fight * * renegade * renegade * renegade [Gunfire] J.t.: Them's Cheyenne. There ain't nothing we can do. We could get in there and stop them wasting cartridges. Damn fool farmers from Ohio and Alabama and such. Aw, the hell with them. Damn dumb farmers. They're getting what they asked for, pushing in where they ain't wanted. Man: Look out behind! [Gunfire and men whooping] Look out! Get out quick! Come on! [Whooping] Get up there. Get over there! Get! Woman: Aah! Aah! Come on! Get the hell back to your wagon! No more shooting until we give the word! July: Cut those dead animals loose! Let's get this wagon moving! In a circle! Come on! Come on! Aah! J.t.: Move it! Get the horses inside the circle! Close up them wagons a little closer. Get them closer together. Whoa, boy! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Hyah! Pull in them mules. Get them mules together. [Whooping] Get them horses over to that side. July: Hold up! Hold up! Hold up! Hold up! Come on! Come on! [Fires gun] Stop shootin' that thing! Who the hell's in charge here? My name is Tom jeffert. Christ almighty, a damn farmer. I knew it. These folks have elected me trail boss. Well, ain't that just dandy? The only plowing you're going to be doing is graves. All right, move that-- hey, mister, we're obliged for your help, but we can manage all right on our own. Damn, I hate farmers. I don't want to have to blow your goddamn kneecap off. I just want to be sure these people get to wherever the hell it is you think you're taking them. Now what's it going to be? All right. We'll do whatever you say. You see how they're just sitting out there? That's because they're fixing to wear you down, run you short of cartridges, and then just walk in and help themselves. Now they see we're fixing to change all that. What are they doing out there? Well, their war chief, he's cooking up something else, I expect. Well, you got more people, right? You're army scouts or something. No, there ain't no more, and we ain't no such thing. Why, hell, we ain't no better off than we were. I don't want to have to hit you again, jeffert. We got about 16 guns with ours, probably no more than 30 rounds apiece. How long you been throwing bullets away? Did they parley first or just come in? Well, they... What'd they want? Well, they wanted some horses and cows and some other stuff. And you said no? Hell, these are poor folks, boy. I'm not going to start giving away-- well, you're fixing to throw their lives away. Hey, July, hold them stock there! Yeah. Them 3 there and them 2 nags. Where the hell you going with that stock? I'm fixing to save all our hides. [Mooing] [Neighs] Get on back to your wagon. Go on! Doesn't look like a lot of damage, huh? Hey, look, mister, if you give them our horses, then we're not going to have enough stock to pull these wagons. Well, you'll be leaving them a couple of your wagons, too. Now, what good is that going to do-- showing weakness? They'll just ride in here and figure they can take everything. What would you do if somebody came traipsing onto your land back in Ohio, Mr. Jeffert? All right,indiana. Indiana. I'd expect you'd either charge them some or run them off, right? It's not the same. They're savages out there. Now what are they doing? You reckon you killed any of them? Doesn't look like it. How many of your people hit? A couple. Those savages are crazy. They come running in here, jabbing at US with those sticks, then running off hollering. I... One of them got me right here on the shoulder-- just light as a feather. Counting coup. What? I'm saying that's just like the Indian-- for the glory of it, that's all. They ain't much on killing. Of course, we taught them better. Good thing your people ain't much at shooting. Well, I reckon they satisfied. You mean that's all there is to it, huh? They're not going to be vexing US anymore? Oh, no. It's a trick. They'll be laying for US up ahead. You watch it. I'd say not-- not that bunch. How far you going, Mr. Jeffert? Montana territory. Well, you'll be out of Cheyenne country soon. Next will be sioux, I expect, and... Then Nez Perce. [Loads gun] Good luck, Mr. Jeffert. Lord knows you going to need it. Thank you, mister... Uh, Coleman, ma'am. John t. You saved our lives. My father, he just-- well, son... If you have a mind to come along with US... We ain't. Maybe for a day or so. Hey. You'll get some good cookin'. My daughter here will make a biscuit to take the wrinkles out of your bellies. What the hell you folks doing out here, Mr. Jeffert? Well, when we got into St. Louis, we were 2 weeks late. Couldn't afford to hang around, so we figured we might catch up with the wagons. Hell, Mr. Jeffert, we ain't trail men. Well, you know the territory and the Indians. Denver's a ways north, Santa fe south. You might find somebody there. That'd be 2 weeks out of our way, son. You got any peaches? Peaches? Yeah. In cans. I just thought you being out of St. Louis and all. Are you sure you won't change your mind? I'm sorry, Mr. Jeffert. We got business in Denver. All right. Good luck to you. Thank you for your help. You ought to be all right from here on, ma'am. Just tell your pa to put himself in the other fella's boots... Or moccasins. They'll see he ain't got much. Y'all will be fine. My name's Mary Ellen. Gee, that's a fine, pretty name, ma'am. Mary Ellen. What's it like-- Montana territory, Mr. Coleman? I don't rightly know, miss jeffert. But I hear god lives there when he decides to visit. Indiana's a fine place, too. Ain't never been there, neither. Always wanted to see Montana, though. Especially now. I hope... I hope you do, Mr. Coleman. See Montana. July: Wonder how them settlers are makin' out. B.d.: Damn dumb farmers. July: Folks sure is funny-- farmin' and all, I mean. US followin' behind cows like we done. I don't find that very funny. Well, what I mean is that folks put their whole lives into it, and--and... And it don't amount to much. Take b.D. Here. I'll bet he got more money in his pocket right now than he's had in his entire life. Well, what the hell's that supposed to mean? Well, I don't rightly know. Least we ain't no damn dumb farmers. Or cowpokes. Not no more. Well, you're sure right about that. [Bird warbling] [Coyote howling] We're out of his county by now. Lot of lawmen don't pay no mind to county lines and such. Could be men in that posse had money in that bank. Well, there ain't moon enough for them to be tracking at night. $287 each man. Seemed like a lot more when we was getting it. Way I look at it, still a year's wages. You two get some shut-eye. I'll take the first watch. B.d.: I don't know if this is such a good idea. J.t.: We need grub, supplies. We ain't sure if that posse turned back. Could've sidetracked. We're shed of 'em. Come on, birdshit. Come on. I ain't never seen that brand before. Double "c"? July: We's in Oklahoma, or new Mexico, most likely. The way we been side-slipping and traipsing all over. It's a nice spread. Everything right up to snuff. J.t.: Let's find out. We'll sleep a sight better knowin' we got some boundary lines between US and them citizens. [Dinner bell ringing] Gents. Sam Harper. You're in time for supper, but about a month late for a job to work. Supper will be just fine, Mr. Harper. We ain't lookin' for work just now. Well, this is Mr. Charles Carter's place. The double "c". Mr. Carter's got some sure fine stock, eh? Racing blood in there. Brought 'em in from the east. Mmm. Mr. Carter sure like clean lines, don't he? That's the way he runs the double "c", mister... Trim and clean. Well, scrape off of little of that prairie there, and tell li Hong I said to lay out 3 more plates. Yeah? We're obliged, sir. Oh, uh, he'll holler like a stuck hog. Pay him no mind. He's a chinaman. Hell of a cook, though. July: We'd be tending fences long about now. B.d.: Worse. Be putting up them horse sheds that Mr. White was figurin' on. Hmm. They say in Montana... It'll snow in July, some years. Well, I don't know about that. Or out in California, they say a man can throw a rock off a mountain-- by the time it hits the bottom, it'll gather up enough snow to fill a boxcar. And then it'll roll smack dab in the middle of that there death valley, [chuckling] Fella told me he seen it happen. Said he seen a big pile of snow sitting out there in the middle of that desert. Is that the same fella that seen them silver wagons in Santa fe? Now you mention it, I reckon it was. [Laughing] Yeah, I expect a fella believe most anything if all he ever saw was the ass-end of a cow. [Laughter] Well, there ain't gonna be nobody tellin' US nothin' no more. I'm sorry about your leg, b.D. Aw, I don't think on it much. It don't hurt bad mostly. We should've had the doctor take that bullet out. It was time we got out of that territory. Don't matter anyway. We got the slug out. We got it out. You know, it's a funny thing-- them knowin' our names and all clear up in Colorado. And them wanted posters. Sure was a... Funny thing. You still thinking, July... Finding funny things? I reckon I am. We never showed back up at the bar "y". 2 whites and a black. 2 whites and a black robbed that bank in Texas then tried for them silver wagons in Denver. Then the stage outside of durango. And the bank in montrose. I don't see how it's very funny. July: Well, I reckon not. But to see it wrote up the way it was-- our names and them drawings. Hell, they didn't look much like US. Looked enough like US to that marshal up there in flagstaff! How many is it now, can you tell me that? Well, it's hard to tell. I mean, them two in the posse... Way we read it. We ain't killed nobody that didn't try and kill US first. 5, maybe 6. Over a year. And, uh, how much we got all told? Well... 1,300 a piece. How much we got left? Not much. [Chuckles] What the hell is all this? We're talkin'. Well, I don't wanna talk no more. They was 6. We killed 6, my best recollect. You been chewing on that all this time? Well... As you said... It was them or US. Well, it should have been US. They was the ones in the right. Sometimes I feel like it was US, you know? If segura hadn't rode in on US that night... On that...Horse. Ohh... I ain't never regretted that part of it. Bad Jim. Just Jim from here on out, like my granddad. Granddad. [Horse snorting] [Whinnying] Come on, boy. Easy now. Red devil bastard. John, Jesus god almighty, get that horse out of there. It's the sweet grass. He smells it-- where they dug. You read that goddamn marker, and you can say that? All this time. Come on, Jim... There'll be oats and corn in monterey. Back, boy. [Dogs barking] It ain't Sunday, is it? No. It's Tuesday or Wednesday. Funny, I ain't seen nobody. That ain't funny, July. What? In that saloon, man with a rifle. Eased back when I seen him. And up on that roof over to the left. Sweet Jesus. Oh, they're all over. I believe they're waitin' for US. Oh, they can't be. Come on up and bother US in California. They can't. Well, they do. We ain't gonna never see that Montana territory. I don't figure to sit around no jail waitin' to get my head in a rope. I expect we better take US a little ride, pardos. Sure you're right. I still got that $100 left that says me and birdshit can beat the 2 of you this time. To the ocean? God damn. You's on. [Laughter] Run to the ocean! Go on, go on! [Whinnies] Get out of there, John t.! Get out of there! B.d.! J.t.: B.D.! July! Unh. [Whinnies] [Coyote howling] Sorry, partners. Sorry it took so damn long to understand. [Neighing] [Neighing] [Neighing] [Whinnies] Easy, girl. It's gonna be all right. [Whinnying] You may not be free and wild no more... But there's worse things, girl. Yeah. There's worse things than being a cow pony... In Montana. [Neighing] [Neighing] [Whinnying] Captioning made possible by mgm/ua home entertainment inc.
