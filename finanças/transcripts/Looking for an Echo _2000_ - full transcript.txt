(knocks) (catchy music) - [Waitress] Two over easy, whiskey toast. - You're looking bright and cheerful today. - Yeah, I went to an early mass. - (laughs) Yeah, right. As soon as you get rid of the poisons. - What kind of a way is that to talk? - I'm just asking. How was she? - To tell you the truth, I don't even know. - Vinnie. You know I love you, and I'm totally in sympathy with your situation here, but something's gotta give. Sooner or later, little Vinnie's gotta come out of retirement. Otherwise these things have a tendency to atrophy. Hey, bagel with a smear. - [Waitress] Sure. - So, where's your friend? - She never made it to the bigs. - Yeah, well, you can't rush these things. You know, I mean, relationships, they take time, right? - Yeah, in my next life. Give me your date of birth. - Why? - Just give it to me, will ya? I'm running out of lucky numbers here. - April 18th. - 418, sounds like a winner. April 18th, son of a bitch. You got a birthday coming up, don't you, boychik? Ah, finally hitting the big 5-0. Welcome to the club. - We're not discussing birthdays this year. That's enough of that. Why do you throw your money away on that crap for, huh? It's a sucker's game. - Do I tell you how to live? - Yeah, you do. All the time. Yo, Anthony! Lover boy. Care to join us? What was that? - What was what? - Who was she? - Do you believe this? - I thought you were sleeping at home. - So far I got lucky. - Yeah, well, you know, you catch some kind of a disease, you're not gonna feel so lucky. - Hey, come on, I'm careful. Take my word for it, I'm very careful. - Hey, stud. I got a gig for you tonight. - I can't do it. Got something something happening at ABC-- - I'll have you out in plenty of time. - It's right in the neighborhood, anyway. Russo's. Best yard in the half. - Whoa. - Big night, big night. In fact, I'm thinking of doing some Vinnie and the Dreamers songs. - Oh, well you keep right on dreaming. - No, I'm serious. I'm expecting some important people to drop in. - You know, when is it gonna click in your brain that Vinnie and the Dreamers don't even exist anymore? - You're telling me you won't do a few lousy songs? Is that too much to ask? - Look, you wanna do our stuff? You should do it. I mean, I gave you permission. - Tell me something. Why do you have to break balls all the time? - Because it's too late, I'm too old, it's too humiliating, and I don't need it. Alright? I don't want anymore assholes messing with my head. - And if my guy shows? - He can have some pasta fazool and go home. - Ah, Jesus. Forget I asked, just forget I asked. - And quit breaking my balls. You coming to the hospital with me? - Come on, I been up half the day. - Well, have a cup of coffee. It'll make you feel better. - Look, I've been there every day for the past month. - And you'll keep going until she comes home. - Vinnie, you know I'd keep you company, but I'm not very good around hospitals. - I know, here. Don't forget to leave the tip. Come on, I'll get you one to go. Let's get outta here. Let's go. - Russo's. - On The Bay. - Okay, how many doctors does it take to screw in a light bulb? - Hm, I give. How many doctors does it take to screw in a light bulb? - I don't know. I've gotta get a second opinion. - Ba dum ch! - Oh, God. Hey, look. I got one for one, listen to this one. A man takes out an ad in a newspaper, right? Wanted, one tough guy for the circus. The next day, a man walks into his office and says, hello, I am the tough guy you want at the circus. How do I know you're tough? Yesterday I'm cutting down trees. By accident, I hack off my right arm, it drops to the ground, blood dripping everywhere, I pick it up with a needle and a thread, I sew it back together again, perfectly perfect. (gasps) Wow, you are one tough guy, I think you got yourself a job. Great! (laughing) Oh, you are so handsome, I love it. - You may go, bro. - Oh, I just gotta get some sleep, and I'll come back tonight. - It's okay, stupid. I won't break. You know, it wouldn't kill you to bring a gift next time. - Oh, really? And what would you like? - How about that bass player of yours. He's got nice buns. - Well, I'm afraid Roger and his buns are spoken for. He's got a wife and kid. How old are you? - Well, in that case then, just bring me something soft and cuddly. - Oh my god. - Consider it done. I love you. Oh, bye. - Bye. (chuckles) Bye. - Bye. - Don't forget to bring my tux. Going straight to rehearsal. - Russo's On The Bay. - Does your daughter talk like this one? - Are you kidding? I use Tina as an example. - See? I'm a God damn role model. - My God, where did I go wrong? - Hey, I think you did a pretty good job, Dad. What are things on your ears, huh? - Clip ons. A little something from my Uncle Vic. - Oh, trashy tasteful, I like 'em. And I also heard what you said to Dr. Ludwig this morning. - Too rough? - Mm. Great! (laughing) Now, listen. If you're feeling headache-y or itchy, or hot or cold, you ring for Julie, she's on deck tonight. - [Girl] Alright. - And also, you are my heavyweight champ. I am so proud of you. - Thanks. - Sweet dreams, baby doll. - Bye. - Bye. (sighs) - So. - So. - What did you say to Dr. Ludwig? - I told him to cheer up. I said if he couldn't find some reason to smile when my count hit 5,000, then he didn't have to bother coming around anymore. - You said that to your doctor? - I was sick and tired of his sourpuss. Look at me. I'm hitting it out of the ballpark, and he can't even muster up a little smile? Forget about it. Daddy. - What? - I'm gonna be alright. I promise. - You're such a beauty. - Vince Pirelli's daughter. She's nice, isn't she? - Who, Joanne? - Mm. - Yeah. She's very nice. Very nice. - Number one with a bullet. - Oh yeah? - Mhm. - So, you always wanted to be a nurse, huh? I said no, I want to be a power forward for the New York Knicks. - What stopped you? - My ankle bracelets. (laughing) Damn this patient for being sick. - Hey, good night, and-- - Oh, hi. - Thank you for everything. It means a lot to me. See you later. - Hey, hey, Vince! Wait up. I'll walk with ya. - You're a big sports fan, huh? - Yeah. - I think I got more in common with you than with my buddy Victor. - Yeah, and besides, whose got better legs? - You don't play fair. (chuckling) What's your story? - What story? - Your story. I mean, how come an attractive woman like you, with legs like yours, you don't have a nice man in your life? - Wait a minute. How could you be so sure I'm not seeing anybody? - Are you? - You mean now? - Yeah, now. You seeing anybody? - Well, no, not now. Not at this precise moment. But that doesn't mean I don't have any number of possibilities. - But I'm saying at the precise moment, right now, that you're not seeing anybody. Right? - That's right, at this moment, I'm not seeing anybody. And you? - Me? - Yeah, you! Are you seeing anybody at this precise moment? - To be continued. - Oh, shall I consider that a no? - That could be construed as a no, yeah. - Aw. - No. (laughing) Hey, thanks a lot. I'll see ya. (whistling) - Vince! Um, can I drop you somewhere? I mean, I got my car. - Yeah. That's nice of you. - I'm a very nice person then. - Number one with a bullet. - Yeah. - Yeah. - What's that mean? - [Vince] You ever read Billboard Magazine? - Oh, yeah! That's right, that's right. So now you tell me, what's your story. - My story? What would be my story? - Want me to spell it out for you? I'd be glad to. What I'm saying is, you ask me every question but the right one. - So what would be the right one? - Oh, come on! I don't believe you! - The right question is, would you like to go drink with me sometime? Interested in lunch some day? What about coffee? Do you like the movies? I like the movies. How about bowling? Now those are good questions. - Would you have dinner with me? Some time? - I'd be open to it. - Should I consider that a yes? - That could be construed as a yes. Oh yes! (lighthearted music) - I'll call ya. - Yeah? Then you have to remember these names in the following order. Charles Oakley, John Starks, Allan Houston, and Patrick Ewing. - Oakley, Starks, Houston, and Ewing?

I'll be there. Yes! (Vince snaps) - What are you so happy about? - I'm just a lucky guy. I am the luckiest guy in the world. - If you say so. - Hey, by the way, I need Saturday night off. - Again? - Well, I mean, considering we are friends. (harmonizing keyboard music) What is that? - It's just something I'm fooling with. - It sounds familiar. So. What do you think? - Looks nice. - What about this one? - It's nice too. - Which one you like better? - I like them both. - Come on, I can only wear one. - Make a fashion statement. Go for that layered look. - Come on, give me a little help there, huh? Just a little help. - You know, I'd love to, I really would. But I don't see how I could make a meaningful evaluation until I see you in the complete ensemble for the full and maximum effect. - What the hell did I do to get such a ball breaker for a son? - Hey, let me ask you something. - [Vince] Ah, I'm late now, what? - Where the hell are you going? Why is style suddenly so important? - I got an appointment. - An appointment. With who? - A woman. - What woman? - A lady. - What lady? - Joanne. - Our Joanne? Joanne the nurse? - Yeah, it's a little dinner. - That's great! She's a terrific lady. - Oh my God, will you look at the time. (lighthearted keyboard music) Will you cut the crap out please? (baseball keyboard music) - The scene, 161st Street and River Avenue, Yankee Stadium. Ladies and gentlemen, you've all heard of the great Bambino, well this is the great big Bambino, who after a 10 year self imposed exile away from the big show is attempting the comeback of the century, a date with a real woman! (baseball organ music) The vicissitudes of the sedentary solitary sequestered socially solo soldier in the game of love, will finally be put to the test as this aging slugger attempts to rewrite the record book of romance. (romantic keyboard music) And here he comes now! Resplendent in a navy double breasted jacket, with offsetting pants and a perfectly color coordinated tie. Ladies and gentlemen, the ever dapper Vincent Pirelli. - You know, that's funny stuff. If I had more time, I'd be laughing my fat ass off. Would you cut the wiseguy routine for a second? Just answer me a question please? - Fire away. - Do guys still bring flowers? - Flowers? - I bought her this corsage. - You know something? That's nice. That's a nice touch. I'm sure you're gonna knock the support hose right off those terrific legs of hers. Hey, you coming tonight? - Oh, you want me to? - Yeah, I do. I'm playing Wetlands in the city, it's a big one. - I'll be there. - Midnight. I'll leave your name at the door! Plus one, in case you get lucky. (romantic keyboard music) - I'll be right down. Thanks. (hard rock music) (doorbell rings) You must be Nicole. - Nikki. And you must be Vince. Or is in Vito? - No, you were right the first time. May I come in? - Sure. ♪ Is what you are and everything you do ♪ - Wow. This is nice. - Joanne asked me to entertain you while she's making herself more beautiful. - Joanne being your mom, right? - You got it.

You look so great. - Well, you don't look so bad yourself. - I got this for you, I don't know if it goes. - Oh, it's beautiful. - Doesn't that belong in some kind of vase? Or time capsule? - Don't you have some homework to do, baby doll? - You guys don't stay out too late. - Go. - Yeah. - You got some piece of work there. - Yeah. But you know, I just keep thinking she'll be married some day, and bothering somebody else, and I'll miss her like crazy. Should we go? - Yeah. (romantic piano music) (laughing) - [Joanne] I don't want to embarrass you. - [Vince] What? - I promised myself I'm gonna ask you this question, and I'm gonna ask. - What do you want to know? - Is it true that you are Vinnie from Vinnie and the Dreamers? - Where'd you hear that? - Just around. - Little brat. - But how could you be Vinnie from Vinnie and the Dreamers and not be proud of that? - Who said I wasn't? - I mean, if my girlfriend Judy knew that I was sitting here having dinner with you right now, she would bust a gut. I mean we thought you were the sexiest thing on two legs. Of course, we were in the third grade at the time. - Oh, that's funny. - But you have no idea what we would have given to see Dreamboat in person. - That was the name they gave me in Teen Magazine, and I hated it. - Well, I'm sorry! Because you were a hunk, and I definitely had a crush on you. Okay, Joanne, shut up. But just tell me one more thing. How? How did five guys from the neighborhood get to be teen idols? - Just found ourselves working the Cheetah's Bar over in Flatbush one night. Heavy hitter in a sharkskin suit, he bounces in, he says you know, he's got a great sound. A Manny. Manny Rosenshine. Swear to God, two months later, number one hit in the country. - That was "This I Swear". - [Vince] Number one for seven weeks. - And then "Forever Mine". - Yeah, that was the B side. What was a bigger hit? - "Your Way". - Yeah, Your Way, yeah. I wrote that about a girl I was madly in love with. Gloria Benedetti. - I guess this Gloria broke your heart, huh? - Why do you say that? ♪ You love her ♪ ♪ I know ♪ ♪ With a broken heart you'll go ♪ ♪ You'll go your way ♪ ♪ And she'll go her way ♪ - Did the song work? Or did Gloria keep breaking your heart? - Over and over again. - Well, what became of this heartbreaker, this Gloria Benedetti? - I married her. She died a couple of years after Tina was born. - I'm sorry. - Yeah, ovarian cancer. Just took her away. It was exactly a week before her 40th birthday. (somber piano music) (pool balls clanging) Nice break. Guess you're solids. - So I am. So I am. Ace in your face. - Nice shot. - You know what's driving me crazy? How could you have so many hits and sell so many records, and have nothing to show for it? - I was just a kid. I mean, what do you know when you're a kid? And these guys give me the down payment on my house. Gave me a nice allowance. Always made sure I had a nice limo at my disposal. I love that car. Man, I could walk into any store in this neighborhood, I just buy anything my heart desires. - What about the royalties? What happened to the real money? - You mean the millions they invested for me? - They took it all? - Gave me a check for 10 grand. Take it or leave it. - That kinda crap drives me insane. (pool balls clanging) Deuce in the caboose. Trey a different way. - I got satisfaction on Manny Rosenshine about a year ago. He turned up in the Jersey swamp with all his fingers cut off, two bullets in the back of his head. He probably switched the bodies, you know? I figure, so what? I mean, who's better than me? I mean, why complain? - Back pockets, both of them. (pool balls clanging) Personally, I wouldn't be happy until all those sons of bitches were hung from the nearest tree by their skin. And that's a medical term. - You don't take any prisoners, do you? - No. I take what's mine.

In fact, they weren't gonna come at all, but Joanne insisted. - Yeah, he hated it. - No, he didn't hate it. - You know, I wasn't gonna do his song. I don't know why I did it. - It's gonna be alright. - And for the lady. - Hey, thanks. - Vince. - I guess tonight must've been, I don't know, kinda strange for you, huh? - What you mean? - Well, I mean, you know, seeing your son up there and everything. I mean, it must've brought back lots of memories, huh? - It did, happy ones. - Well, I know you were happy for Anthony. - Ah, I couldn't of been happier, period. - You know, I don't think I ever tasted one of these before. Mm, yummy, delicious. - You never tasted a bialy? You sure you're really from Brooklyn? - Mhm. In my neighborhood, we didn't eat this kind of stuff. We were very limited. (chuckling) You know, if something's bothering you, it's best to get it off your chest. You'll live longer. - Yeah, but nothing's bothering me. - You want that toast? - No, no, here. - Otherwise, it's gonna spoil. - I had a feeling I might find you here! - Oh, hey. - Car running okay? - Yeah, good, good no problems. - Sandy's got one of those little Miata's.

(laughing) - [Waitress] Here you go. - Thanks. - Well, we had dinner at the River's Edge. Yeah, and it was really beautiful. - Just like prom night, huh? (chuckles) So, did you check out Tony? - Yeah, yeah, it was great. - Yeah. - Not an empty seat in the room. He's really got something going for him, you know? - Hey, why not? You should've seen this guy when he was starting out. Oh man, those little girls loved his ass. (chuckling) - Why you gotta talk that way in front of women for? - (laughs) That's okay. But thank you for being a gentleman, unlike you. - What? - So you and Vince go back a ways? - Are you kiddin'? We've been best friends since 6th grade, St. Anthony's. - He's really two years older than me, you know? Since there were better students than my friend here, I actually caught up. (laughing) - I had a learning disability, okay? - Yeah. Math, history, sciences. - Funny, very funny. - Oh, then you knew Dreamboat. - What, you mean this S.O.B. never told you who I am? - No. - You didn't tell that if it wasn't for me, there wouldn't be no Vinnie and the Dreamers? - Oh, without Vic, there wouldn't have been a Vinnie and the Dreamers. (laughing) I mean, the man is totally responsible for the group, all its success. In fact, now that I'm thinking about it, it was all your doing, wasn't it? - I mean, granted, he might be overstating my contribution just a scooch, but yeah, I was right there at the inception. One of the original Dreamers. - Oh, would you do something now? - Joanne, don't ask.

I don't want to be a cop. - All I'm suggesting is that you take the test as a fallback position, you don't have to make any commitments. Besides, you might even like it. - See, I'm already doing what I like. Do you understand this? I'm alright doing what I like. - And you guys are good? Nobody's taking anything away from you? - Thank you very, very much. - What are you gonna do? You're gonna base your whole life in this one in a million shot? It's ridiculous!

No, seriously, seriously. From a cop's perspective, what's more popular, chocolate frosted or honey dipped? - Hey! What are you, stupid?

It's like six pounds of shit in a five pound bag. - Alright, easy does it. - You be a cop, you be a musician, follow your dream. You know how long I've been listening to that crap? Am I supposed to dream it was your dream to be a bartender? - [Tommie] Hey. - Serve some drunken assholes martini with just the right amount of Vermouth? - [Tommie] Hey. - I know you hated it that I did your song, but I didn't it your way, the way you would've done it.

Vince, I'm sorry to say there's been a serious complication. - Oh, come on. What are you talking about complications? What kind of complications now? - Tina has developed a form of viral infection, she's developed pneumonia. - Which is treatable, right? - Normally, it would be. But we're not dealing with a normal situation. - I gotta know what the hell is going on, excuse me. I left my daughter in here yesterday, alright? She's feeling great. We're taking her home, right? You want to tell me what they did to her? - Sometimes things happen. - Well, I know things happen, things happen, yeah. But just somebody tell me when in the name of Christ does a kid develop pneumonia in a God damn hospital? - Vince, would you please try to stay calm? - Stay calm? My kid's in an ICU, I've just been informed. You want me to stay calm. I'm sorry, I'll stay calm. Look, you promised me, huh? You made a promise, you said she's coming home. - Vince, I gotta learn what viral strain is causing the infection. To do that, I'm gonna have to perform a surgical procedure. - What'd you say about an operation? - It's called a bronchoscopy. - How dangerous is this procedure? - Any time you have to operate, there's always danger. Especially with a little girl who's gone through everything Tina has. It's important that we move quickly. I need your consent before I can proceed. Now, I want you to talk about it and tell me what you decide. I'll be in my office. - Pop, I don't think we have any choice. We gotta do it. - I gotta decide. That's a decision-- - Ludwig's an excellent doctor, Vince. - How long has she been like this? - We took her down to the ICU two hours ago. - Why didn't you call me? - I did. - Why didn't you tell me she was running this kind of a high fever, nobody told me that. - But I did-- - No, nobody told me about this kinda condition! Nobody. I got a half a brain in my head here. - You don't leave that kinda message on a machine. I tried to find Anthony and Tommie. And when I got Francine, she said she'd find you. There's nothing you could do. - Nothing I could do? What are you talking about, nothing I could do? It's my daughter in there, alright? Not yours, not anybody else's, alright? Let me decide whether or not there's something I could do, alright? Just let me decide! Just let me decide! - What are you doing? What are you doing? - No. - Joanne's not responsible. Don't take it on her! - I can't count on people, alright? Never have! - Why are you saying that? Why are you saying that? - Nobody gives a good God damn around here about anybody but themselves. - Pop, Pop, take it easy. That's not fair, and you know that. - What are you talking? If I didn't drag you down here by the hair on your head, you'd never show up! - Why are you saying that? - When was the last time you saw your sister, Tommie? - Give me a break, would you give me a break? I don't know what hours I'm working! I come whenever I can! - Great! Tell that to her now. - You know, you could be a real bastard sometimes, you know that? - Watch your mouth around me today.

I mean, did you ever get to thinking what might have been? - This is over. I mean, the writing was on the fucking wall. Take my word for it, it was over. - Yeah, I know. But-- - Hey. Remember the Beatles? - Some British kids, right? - Yeah. - But don't you think we were good enough? I mean, don't you think we had something those other groups didn't have? - Yeah.

It was this fuck's fault. - Hey. I told yous go on without me. - Ah, yeah. - Even gave you permission to use the name. - Oh, yeah, that really worked out great. - Yeah, right. (laughing) - How do you think it was for me watching you guys on stage with some pimple faced kid who couldn't even sing my part? - I didn't know you were there. - Yeah, I checked yours out. A couple of times. - Vince. It didn't have to be that way. - How should it have been, Pooch? Tell me how it should've been. - You had something special! - I had a wife, and I had my kids. And what's this bullshit we quit too soon? We didn't quit too soon, we didn't have to. Nobody gave us a choice. They kicked us in the ass, didn't they? They sent us packing! - Hey, hey. That's not exactly true. I mean, we were still able to get play dates. - Yeah, in Shithole, Mississippi, alright? Pissant, Wyoming. When our records stopped selling, could we play the A rooms? When Manny Rosenshine canceled the contracts, any other labels step up to the plate? You know when my Tommie was born, I couldn't pay my God damn hospital bills. Was there anybody anywhere who offered to help? We were losers. Nobody gives a flying fuck about losers. - Oh, Vinnie. That's not what you really thought, is it? That we were losers? - Hey, Augie, from where I was standing, alright? A man, he can't support his own family, I'm sorry, he's a loser. - It wasn't like that. - What do you mean it wasn't like that? They stuck a fork up our ass! They sent us home with our dicks in our hands, our tails between our legs! What do you mean it wasn't like that? - Are you saying that's all you got out of those days? - I got my stack of 45s, thank you. I got my torn scrapbooks, alright? I got my fucked up memories. - Well, let me tell you something. I walked away from those days with a lot more. A lot more. - You're a lucky guy. - It's funny. Because I always thought you were the lucky guy. The luckiest guy in the world. - Welcome to the real world. So where's that watch, hm? Where is that fucking Rolex anyway? - Who the fuck are you? - Hey, I told you the money was not for gambling, didn't I? - You told me. - [Vinnie] Yeah, I told you. - Fuck you, man. - What? - [Pooch] Hey fellas, enough, enough! - Go fuck yourself! - Hey!

Trying to fill that emptiness. Always pushing. Never happens the way I need it. I see you up there. It all seems so easy. And magic is always there, always. And it drives me fucking crazy.
