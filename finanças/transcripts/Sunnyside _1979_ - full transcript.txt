It's absolutely lovely. You know, I was looking for something that had kind of a soft fabric thing like this. If I had a camera, I could have made a scoop. Do you think there's something great about being killed? Yes, that's all they talk about. Nine, 10 years old, that's all they say. If I get that job, we can move out of the neighborhood. That'd be the best thing for everybody to get out of this neighborhood. I can't eat no more, I had too many hot dogs. Okay tiger, homework and bed. Someday I'm gonna grow up. Soon I hope. He's already pretty big, what are you talking about. Don't encourage him. Everything gets so complicated. Hey, don't be so dramatic. Okay, homework and bed, let's go. Kiss your mom goodbye.

We're not here to criticize but to listen. We gotta feel guilty. I don't think we oughtta talk about that right now. Why, you got something in mind? The bible is plain on the topic. Fornication is a sin. Then let's talk about it open. Excuse me, pops. You know, as a student of the subject, I would say think about it. Praise the lord. Yeah baby. Harry, us getting together with the warlocks and the death makers tonight could be important to the neighborhood. Look, there's no reason why we can't work together. Well, what do you think? I gotta see. That may be too late. I mean everybody working together as brothers and sisters with those guys. It might keep some blood off the street. The Reaper ain't no saint and ain't overflowing with love for you or Reg. Reg is stupid Nicky. Those carnival guys, I mean they're ripping everybody off. That's something else. Those guys' interest is busting and wasting and they don't give a damn why. Nicky, you know what you are, you know what I'm trying to say. You're a dreamer Nicky, a dreamer. Sure I am. Look, we're the three toughest gangs in the neighborhood, right? Right that's all I care about, that's why we need them and there won't be any wastin'. The bustin' will keep them happy. Hey Nicky, how you doing? How are you doing, man? Good. This is a nice place you got here, hunter's ballroom. It's all right, it gives me renewed confidence in our alliance here. Hey, it's really beautiful to see you guys getting along so nice. Now if we're finished with the bullshit, can we get on with thefucking show. I'm fucking sure, hey goofy that's fine with me man. I'm horny, you know. Everyday, we're gonna have a fucking show here, yay. Yeah, party. Yeah, party. Yeah, party. What's with you guys? What? You act like your brains dropped through your asses. I called this meaning to be serious. Oh yeah, I forgot about that. Yeah, talk about people coming into our neighborhood fucking us and our people around. Ain't nobody gonna fuck me around. They just can't come in here, pretend to be our friends, rip us off and leave. It's time we rip them off and make them leave. Nick's right, we're here to get organized man. That means we gotta sit together and listen. And what we're doing here is a first, you dig that. Trust is a must. Yeah. Don't come too close to me, man. We got us the fucking poet. And trust is a must. While we man, trust in the must. That's right man, I am a poet. Since you got all the moves, asshole, why don't you take over. Oh no thank you Reaper. No, that's okay, Reaper. You see, 'cause now that you are getting on in years, I wouldn't be wanting to to rob you what just could be your last big scam. Grand daddy Reaper. You get where I'm coming from. I know where you're going. Yeah, I know where your mama's going too, asshole. All right, I've had it with this shit. We never got together before, we don't have to get together now. I got better things to do tonight. Yeah, like who? I just don't wanna hear any more of I'm pissed about this and I'm pissed about that and if we could get together we could be something. I don't wanna hear it. Okay, you've made your point, let's hear the plan already. A bunch of wise ass hoods are running the carnival. Everything's rigged, man. They cut the ride short when it gets the least bit crowded, they're ripping off the community and feeling good about it. Community. Put your dog on the leash, man. They're supposed to be sharing with the community. Not only is that not happening, but they're taking us for chumps. I ain't a chump, night crawlers ain't chumps. This will make the job easier. How many of these can you get? Enough. Look at that. Shit, toy gun. Here's the carnival layout. We split up into three groups, we work fast. Gray, this is your section here. Reaper, you take this section and this is mine. We work fast, nobody gets hurt. You got that? Hey man, we got to bust some head, let them know we've been there. They'll know we've been there stupid, we'll have their money. Yeah, we'll take that too. But see the way I figured... You ain't got enough brains to figure shit. Well, who are you talking to? Who the fuck does it look like? You guys got the plans for the carnival? Got them? Yeah, I got the fucking plan. You got it? I'm cool. That's the cause. Cause that's gonna put cash in your pockets. You wanna bust each other's heads, that's your shit. That's my kid brother, Danny. I should kick you right in your ass. You okay? Something bugging you? Yeah. What is it, the weather? What the hell were you doing there tonight? I was worried about you. I heard you were teaming up with Eddie Reaper. You could have gotten your ass killed. Danny, you hear too much.

Con, you call that a con? Danny, I don't have talent like you. You got a way out. It ain't that easy for me. You okay? Make sure you clean up before mom sees you. How are you doing, man. Are you going to a funeral with that shit? Yeah. Drop them out, man. Going to a funeral with that suit, man, all black shit. So what's the deal, Desi. Well, it's a gift, we're going to smoke. For weed? Nope, legit cigarettes with the city tax stamp on them. Oh yeah? Yeah, two bucks a carton. Okay, get me 50 carton. I can't sell you 50, you gotta buy 3,000 cartons or more. I don't want 3,000 cartons, I want 50. Well, I can't give you 50. But I want 50. I just can't give you 50, you gotta get 3,000. stuff it. Hey Reaper. Hey Reaper wait, I'm not here to fuck around man. I'm here to take care of business, you understand? I can't sell you 50 cartons, you gotta buy 3,000 cartons. I don't want them. Well, let me give you some friendly advice, okay.

Tell them Eddie Reaper sent you. I get a good discount. Hey, how do you like this wine? It needs some ice. Ice, you don't ice in the stuff. You enjoy it. Oh, Nicky, how are you? Little wine? I don't drink that stuff. Scotch. Hey, Danny was here, but he left. I don't want him around. Hey, come on Nicky, he could be valuable as your brother looks good in front of... Knock it off Harry, I don't want Danny here and don't forget it. Okay, okay, I was only... Okay Nick, I understand. All right, so we agree. How's everybody's spirits? Terrific, right guys, huh?

Get some ice in that. It'll get back tomorrow. Can you put this in the bag there. Hey Nick. Nick, take this man. We decided. You know, you guys have a way of saying a lot when you're quiet. Which one of you is the most pissed off? I am. Reaper's a warlock. The warlocks are bloodthirsty and we're walking into that ballroom to hand them out money. I mean does that make sense... Relax and keep cool. The money will be split. Nick, you know Reaper ain't stupid. You know, Nick. And Reggie, you got brains in your ass. Hey Reaper, you used real guns. That was dumb you wasted Reg and Bibi, shot a carnival guy. That was stupid. It was supposed to be toy guns. No killing, no arm robbery. That's true Nick. So what? Now we're split the take 50/50, right? You listening to me? Look man, Reg was my business. That was personal. He was dumb. Always drinking. Yeah, and he talked too much to women. It wasn't part of the deal. Hey, I'm talking to you. Yeah. We were supposed to teach those carnival guys they couldn't come and rip off the community. That was the deal. Oh look man, I ain't running a sunday school, you know. If you're too soft. That's bullshit, Reaper. Put the gun away. Reaper, you keep your motherfucking ass off my turf. You got it? okay Nick, you got what you wanted and I got what I wanted. Now we split and we're even, right? 6,921. Yeah. Hey, we did good Nick. It shows what our potential for the future could be. $6,921. Split it up. It's already split. We should keep you to our next adventure. Hey Nick. Nick really you know on a personal note, blowing up isn't good for your health, man. Hey, Alden, enough, okay. Hey man, what it is. Those guys are crazy. Hey, we came out with more than we went in with, right okay? You feel better? I think so, Nick. Yeah, well I won't be happy until I bust Reaper's head. And I want Ice, I want Ice bad. What about Reg and Bibi? Yeah and the other guy wasted? That's Reaper's problem. I got it. I mean I got what will pull you out of the hole. What's that? A party.
