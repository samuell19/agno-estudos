Well, well, if it ain't our landlord, Mr. Flint. Cut the soft soap. I just came to inform you you'll have to vacate at the end of the month, when your lease expires. Why? Because I made a deal with the Pinch Penny Market at three times the rent you're paying me. But we've been here 10 years. Oh, he's only joking, ain't you? Oh, oh. My lumbago. Oh, get me a plaster for my back. Quick. Get him a plaster. Bend over. I... I can't. Oh. Hurry up, don't take all day. Here we are, fellows. All right, take that. There you are, pal. Take it off! It's burning! It's burning! I'll get it off. Hold still there. Hold still there. Trying to boil me alive, huh? You did this on purpose. I'll have the law on you. I'll have you run out of town. Amos. Amos, I've been looking all over for you, Amos... What are you following me for, you old hag? I told you to pack up and get out. I'm through with you. I'm giving you the air. I'm tired of looking at an old hag like you. Now, 25 years is enough. I'll fix you too. You haven't heard the very last of me yet. You'll regret this. I'll bet that miser eats rusty nails for breakfast. Ever since I've become old and lost my beauty, he's threatened to run out on me. And now he's done it. Oh, what will I do? We have a spare room in the back. And you're welcome to it. Thank you. Bless you, boys. Poor woman. It's tough to get old. Yeah. Hold it. Hold it. I got it. What is it? A terrific idea. If we can discover a vitamin to make old people young, we'll become rich and famous. It's tremendous. It's colossal. It's putrid. Right. Then what are we stalling for? Get busy. After you, doctor. After you, doctor. Why certainly, professor. Mishegas. Mishegas. Hyreecon. Hyreecon. Hyreecon. Hyreecon. You put in too much. What's the idea of hitting me with that pestle? You're lucky I didn't hit you with the mortar. The mortar the merrier. Quiet. Ow. Put that pestle down, man. Mixer. Mixer. Here's the mixer. Coming up. Okay. Get set. Oh. Oh. Ooh, excuse me. Hey, it's generating. Hey, hey, break it up. Let's give it some air. On the fire. Get me that. Hey... What's the matter with you? Cut it out, will you? Come on. Hurry up. More. More H2O. I've got it. Here. I think it's out fellas. Hold everything. I'll take a look. Double-crosser. Ingensomen. Anacanapanazan. Oh, boy, this time I'm sure we've got it. Right-o. And remove the pestle and release the fountain of youth. Right. It's stuck. Oh, step aside, nitwit. Hold the mortar. We're ready to try it. I refuse to be the guinea pig again. Okay, kid, okay. All you have to do is smell it. All right, we'll call Mrs. Flint. ♪ Oh, Mrs. Flint ♪ ♪ Flint ♪ ♪ Flint ♪ Open your mouth. And close your eyes. We're going to give you a big surprise. Uh, well... Beep, beep, beep. I haven't felt like this since... Goodness knows when. I feel giddy. I actually feel young. You are. You are. Boys, we did it. We did it. Our fountain of youth invention will make us rich. We can buy our own building now. Come right over here and look. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I'd never believe it. I'm young again! She's gorgeous. May I have this dance? Yes. Wait. Do you mind if I cut in? Do you mind if I cut in? No. Say, you're not a bad dancer. Oh, I'm from Missouri. We're waltzing. Yes, sir, what can I do for you? I want some bubble gum. Yes, sir. There we are. That will be five cents. Thank you. Hey, fellas. Oh, boy, a skyrocket. No, no, no. It's a cake I baked to celebrate my re-birth. How do you like it? Oh, that's terrific. Let's have a slice. Oh, no. It has to be decorated with marshmallows. I'll get the marshmallows. Uh, marshmallows. Oh, marshmallows. Here's one that's open. Oh, heavens, my roast. Don't worry, we'll drape the cake. Taste? No, thanks, you take it. Get out of here. Here's the marshmallows. All right. Has marshmallows got pits? No, they're empty like your skull. Drape that cake. I'll bring the dishes. All right. All right. The marshmallows are a little stale. We got 'em in fresh yesterday. Could be. This reminds me of filet of sole. And heel. Oh, what do you call this cake? Marshmallow jumbo. Tastes more like marshmallow gumbo. Where are those scalawags? What's all the racket, Amos? Why, I... Serena. Why... Serena, you're young and beautiful. How did you do it? We discovered the fountain of youth. We can make old people young. Make me young. Make me young. I'll... I'll give you this store for nothing. I've got a deed right here in my pocket. I'll sign it right over to you. That's fair enough. Get busy, boys. Now, wait a minute, Flint. We don't know how this stuff is going to work on a man. You can't back down on your bargain. It'll work. It worked on Serena. Beep, beep, beep. I feel funny, awful funny. I'm starting to feel young already. Ha. I'm turning younger every second. My blood is boiling like a geyser. Even my muscles seem to be growing. I feel as strong as an elephant. I feel like a changed man. I feel like I could tear the building apart. You dirty double-crossing rats. So you made a monkey out of me, eh? Why, I'll tear you apart. Open up there. Let me in. Larry. What happened, Larry? Go on. Say it. Hey, get a bottle of smelling salts. All right, kid. What... What's the idea of kicking me, you back-biter? Honest, M-M-Moe, I d-d-didn't d-d-do it. You didn't kick me when you were sta...? Oh, I suppose he did it. I ought to punch you right... I've got you. Easy, now. Take it easy. Let me go. Let me go. Take it easy. Whoa. I'll flatten your head like a pancake. Oh, get up. Moe, your head is as flat as a pancake. But you look better that way. Do something. Get me out of this. All right, hold still. There you are. Now, put your head down there and I'll iron it out. Put it right down there. There you are. That looks swell. How do you like that? Oh, those bells. Well, it's a good thing I brought... Hey, fellas, the chloroform knocked him cold. I got an idea. This guy will make us rich. We'll put it in a cage and exhibit the only talking gorilla in captivity. Hey, it would be better with two talking gorillas. Yeah, but where are we going to get...? No. Moe, that look in your eye. I ain't no gorilla. Not yet. Wait till I get the fountain of youth. Now, wait a minute... No. It's great being a gorilla. You don't have to pay income tax. I don't care. Let me go. Let go of me. I don't want to be a gorilla. Wait a minute. Now, don't get excited. All you have to do is open your mouth and say, "Ah". No. I didn't... Beep, beep, beep.
