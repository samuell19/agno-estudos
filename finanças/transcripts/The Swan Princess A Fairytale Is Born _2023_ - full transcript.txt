As your grand-uncle through my fourth wife, thrice removed, who you once met at a food bazaar when you were 3, you are now the queen. [chuckles] [gasps] And, therefore, your husband is the king. Here are the keys to the castle. The big one sticks, but just give it a quick twist. Best of luck. The king." I'm queen! And you're the king! [laughs] [Max] Mm-hm. He was right about that key.

Well, I wonder if the plight of unwanted dogs might be more lasting. [upbeat music playing] Let me get this straight. Your cause is gonna be "Save the Dogs." Yes, and I need you to help me find the perfect poster dog. There's no poster dog here. [howling] Nothing but mutts that need to be rounded up every week. Well, if that's your attitude, no wonder there's no poster dog! -[barking] -[tense music playing] [barking] Escape from Number Three! [lively music playing] Do it!

Queen Uberta and King Maximillian of Chamberg. Come, please. -[whimsical music playing] -[Council laughs] [Sebastian] Today, King Maximillian, you join the Council of Crowns. I invite you to address us. Thank you, King Sebastian. And I, in turn, invite my wife to say a few words. If Sebastian wanted her to speak, he would have asked her. -I was just about to say the same thing! -[Sebastian clears throat] I would like to tell you about my paws. [gasps] I mean, cause! I don't have paws, of course. But my friends do. My doggie friends. They have paws. [both groan] Hang in there, Bertie. Oh, how many of man's best friend lay in cages, as we speak, or roam the streets in want of food and love? Yes, I speak of the unwanted dogs. Aren't dogs Queen Wixom's cause? [gasps] She's not going to like that. Won't each of you take the paw of a sad and lonely dog today? -I'm in. -As am I. I will pledge my support as well. [attendant applauding] [yelps] But what about all the unwanted cats? The poor kitties-- -Save the dogs! -Bravo, Bertie! Whoo-hoo! "Save the dogs." Pssh! Let's turn the topic to the thieves who are raiding our crops and herds! We need to catch and jail every one of those thieving barbarians. Edgar's right. We'll build more jails if need be. -Yes! Jail the barbarians! -Barbarians? -[pensive music playing] -[gasping] My father came from these people. And I never once saw him bring an axe to the dinner table. [Council members chuckling] It would be better if we called them what they really are: Hungry people who just need work. Work? Who will hire thieves? Any landowner who sees the wisdom in hiring workers over building jails. You really think you can strike a deal between landowners and thieves? Maybe not. But this Council is the greatest force for good in the world. Don't we owe them our best effort? I move we send King Maximillian to talk with them. No. Let him fail. I echo the motion. All in favour, stand. [dramatic music playing] The majority agrees. [suspenseful music playing] -I hate doing this. -Let's make it quick. [rooster crows] Mmm. That sounds tasty. [chicken clucking] -Here, boy. Come on, come on. -[squawks] Come on, boy. Come here. Good boy. [Max] It's not a dog. Easy, now. I'm alone and unarmed. -Cousin Max? -Cousin Peter! You've put on some weight. [chuckles] You look good. King Maximillian? Hey! You can't run forever! He's right. He's seen us. He knows me! -What are we gonna do, then? -I do have a proposal from the Council. -Do you mind? -[chuckles] Sorry. We could kidnap him and hold him for money. You won't get anything from the Council. But my wife, she loves me, and she'll probably pay a little. -[tense music playing] -Let's give him to the pirates. To the pirates it is. Come on. Seriously? -[Peter] Quiet. -Come. -[Max grunting] -[all grunt] Do you know what it took to get the Council to even let me come here and talk to you? They wanna build more jails! And that's where you're gonna spend the rest of your lives, unless you listen to me. I think I can get you work. And not just you but everyone in your situation. No one hires people like us, Max. We won't know if we don't try. Guys, come on! [pensive music playing] You're not getting away with it this time! -Lord Romberg! -King Maximillian? You've put on weight. Oh, but you look good. Everyone looks so good tonight. What? Why are you here? I'll cut to the chase. These men will never steal from you again if you give them work. [laughs] You want me to hire thieves? Exactly. And I'm not gonna lie, they'll need training. This one can't tell the difference between a rooster and a dog. If you do this, all the other landowners will follow your lead. And the stealing will stop. Come by in the morning. And by the way, I haven't put on an ounce. Thanks, cousin. Phew. [whispering indistinctly] Max... [whispering indistinctly] -...audacity! -Seen Max? Oh. -The big hero? -[Ivan chuckles] [tranquil music playing] [Ivan] King Maximillian. I'm not too proud a man to admit when I've been proven wrong. Well done brokering that deal. Got lucky, I guess. King's Rule Number 1: Take credit for your accomplishments, or someone else will. [chuckles] I keep hearing your cannons are the best in the world. Credit accepted. You see how that works? [upbeat music playing] Mmm! The trout en croute is fabulous, don't you think? What are you hiding from me? [laughs nervously] Me? Nothing. [tense pensive music playing] [whimpers] Queen Uberta has also chosen dogs as her cause. [gasps] [groans] "Dear Wilhelmina. Your gift for my coronation is one of a kind." Special, uh... delivery, Highness. [Wixom] To Queen Uberta! From Queen Wixom, the true champion of dogs! I'm flattered that you have stolen my cause. Nevertheless, it gives me no choice but to challenge you to a dog show! -[tense music swelling] -"I gleefully accept. And I apologise ahead of time for winning." [laughs] "No apology necessary, I'm sure." -"Are you?" -"Stop writing me!" -"I will." -"Good!" "Great! P.S. What is a dog show?" [serene music playing] -The ducks have landed. -[cooks] Yes! Queen One's about to take the first bite. -Is it good? -Oh, the best I've ever had. -She likes it! -[cooks] Yeah! -Oh, Aubri. -[gasps] Wait! I may have bitten off more than I can chew. -Now she hates the aftertaste. -[cooks groan] What do I know about a dog show? Going up against Wixom's poodles is a tall order. -You will need help. -But what kind of help? -Uh-oh. -These potatoes are wonderful. Queen One finds the potatoes confusing. -[cooks] Huh? -[Aubri] Mmm! Let me think. -Oh, dear. They baffle Queen Two as well. -[cooks] Huh! You'll need someone very clever who can train them to do fantastic things. Yes! We must prove that you don't have to be a purebred to be loved. You also have to feed the dogs right, so their coats shine. [gasps] -The beets have given Queen Two hives! -[cooks] Oh! [groans] How to feed a dog... Please, universe, send me someone to help! Please, tell me what I can do! [pensive music playing] Thank you, universe. Now, that's a ham fit for a king. And a queen, of course. -[grunts] -[suspenseful music playing] [music turns whimsical] [This growls, then barks] [That whines] I'll feed you later! Shoo! -[growls] -[yells] [lively music playing] -[The Other growls, then yelps] -[yelling] [This chewing loudly] Gotcha! Take that! Ow! [dogs barking] Wait! Hey, hey, you get those--! No! No! [lively music continues] [Ferdinand] Thieves! Bertie, we've got a problem with Who, What, and Whatever. -This, That, and The Other? -Yeah, those guys. [whimsical music playing] [Uberta] I think you're both seeing things. I made up a dog skating on turkeys? Oh? Who tore my pants to shreds, then? [Uberta] There, you see? But they're faking! -[dogs snoring] -[Uberta] They are not! -[suspenseful music playing] -[door closes] -Busted. -[dogs whimper] The honeymoon is over. You're getting a trainer. [upbeat music playing] Niner, niner, squiggly line, carry the two... Eh... this thingy plus that thingy, plus pi squared, and... Ha, ha! Hello, hypotenuse! Ahem! You'll need to make an appointment. -[clears throat] -I said, you'll-- Oh. Continuing Education for the Elderly is down the hall. Excuse me? [groans] All right. I'll show you the-- -Do I have your attention now? -Why, you-- Berta! The new queen from Chamberg! Enchanted. Dr Balthazar Rogers. Professor, scientist, and genius. What would it take to draw you away from this dreary classroom into the most interesting project on earth? My job is far from dreary! You'll have all the money you need and more. And yet, at times, it can be tedious. What is this project, may I ask? -[uplifting music playing] -You will prove to an unbelieving world, against all odds and all conventional thinking, that stray mutts can perform just as well-- Nay, better than purebreds. I'll be a dog trainer? Oh, I see. I'm afraid you lack what's required for the job. No, no, now, wait just a hot nanosecond. No, no. I can see that you lack the necessary vision-hyphen-fortitude. Vision-Hyphen-Fortitude is my middle name! My parents couldn't decide. -Nevertheless-- -I'll do it! Your contract. Mark my words, these dogs will be doing ballet and algebra by the time I'm done with them. [chuckles] I'm developing the queenly skill of manipulation. [snoring] [lilting music playing] -[This barks] -[both yelp] She's the alpha, all right. But not for long. [tense dramatic music playing] [music intensifies] Thank you. Training begins tomorrow at 7 a.m. sharp! [dramatic music playing] [Sophia] Thank you for supporting my proposal, my fellow crowns. I will direct my committee to move forward. That concludes the agenda for today. Except for one last item. My good friends, I am stepping down as chair of this Council. In doing so, it is my prerogative to nominate the next chair of the Council. And so I shall. What? But he's barely joined the Council! This Council has never allowed seniority to determine its future. What? The nomination awaits a second. I will allow King Maximillian's good friend the honour. Then I do second the nomination of King Maximillian! [uplifting music playing] [pensive music playing] [man coughs] [shivering] [coughing] I don't suppose you'd be available to paint a queen? Yes. Yes, please. Give me a minute. I'm so sorry. Come on, now. Settle in. [Uberta] Now, Magnus, I have a few ideas for an iconic pose. -Me as a classic goddess. -[whimsical music playing] [chuckles] Or me as the Tiger Mother! [imitates roar] Which one do you love the most?

So long as you choose Siegfried. Of course. So long as you choose Bertha. Oh! All right. [cheering continues] Our people seem happy. Who wouldn't be? -[pensive music playing] -[gasps] [Uberta] I know how long you and William have hoped for a child, my dear Aubri, so it would crush me to know that my joy has caused you the slightest pain. Because you are my example, my best friend, my north star. "Sweet Uberta." Your joy is my joy. I cannot wait to hold your child and pray that he or she will call me Auntie A for all of my days. -[tender music playing] -[sniffles] Dear, dear Aubri. [upbeat music playing] Okay, Derek, aim at me as best you can. As soon as you let it go, you say, "Now!" Sounds dangerous. Oh, Daddy won't get hurt. It's just a little game called Catch & Fire. The junior version. Uh... I'm gonna ask Mommy. [chuckles] No, no, no. You see, Derek, Catch & Fire is just a king and young prince kind of thing. If you get the queen involved... Well, you know. She freaks out? Well, yeah. Just the men? -So when you let go... -Yell, "Now!" You got it. [grunts] Oh! Now! [whimsical music playing] -I hurt you? -No, no, no. You didn't hurt me. I just wasn't expecting you to be able to shoot like a pro. Just say it earlier. Now! [chuckles] A lot earlier. -Now! -Earlier. Now! [music turns dramatic] Wow! [music turns tender] Well, if it isn't Vision-Hyphen-Fortitude Rogers. -You came. -Eh... You did send a carriage for me and an envelope full of money. It appears I am in need of your services again. Oh, no, let me guess. You want me to train your underachieving goldfish? No, no. Just your future king. Me? I will raise up and mould the heir to the throne? Don't get ahead of yourself, sport. I'll still be his mom. -[sentimental music playing] -Uh-- Eh-- Ah... The answer is yes. Yes. A thousand times yes! Oh, and, uh, by the way, from now on you're a lord. Lord Rogers. -[cheerful music playing] -Uh-- Ah... Oh, dear. [Uberta chuckles] [Ivan] King Maximillian, if it please the chair, I have an urgent matter to bring before this Council. By all means. Friends, I have received strong information. The pirates are planning to raid our merchant ships again. [gasps and indistinct chatter] Oh, great! If it's not thieves, it's pirates! I say we put Ivan's cannons to good use against them. Today! This is unsettling news, I agree, King Edgar. But, friends, is it wise? Let me guess. You want to make a deal with the pirates too. -Exactly what I was thinking. -[Council members chuckle] [laughs] I'm sure King Maximillian knows we don't make deals with pirates. Does he? What does a peasant's son know about this Council's dealings? Yes, a peasant's son. [indistinct chatter] Rest assured, King Edgar, I am well aware of the Agreement of '02, the Treaty of '05, and the Compromise of '09. The pirates broke every one of them and never kept their word. -Nevertheless... -Ah, here it comes. ...we must keep trying. I know you want what's right, King Maximillian. But I'm with King Edgar on this. Strike first! -Well, I disagree. -Friends, let's not make a hasty decision. Let's cool our minds, study this out, and vote on it in the morning. -I second the motion. -Hear, hear. [pensive music playing] [sighs] What do you think, my friend? You have some support. Let me work on it tonight. We may have the votes we need tomorrow. -[suspenseful music playing] -[man snoring] [yawns] Hm? What? How long are we going to wait for him? Let's vote! Harbourmaster Fleming requests an audience. -[ominous music playing] -[grunts] This better be important. I thought you should know that King Maximillian's ship... sailed out. Sailed out? When? Well, about midnight, Highness. -And you waited until now to tell us? -Well, I-- [cannon fires] [cannon fires] -Pirates! -[Ivan] To the cannons! Fire when ready! [William] Was this just a warning? Or a celebration. You think they have Max? [ominous music playing] [William] No. That's Max's flag. [Ivan] No one could have survived this. Max's journal. "I believe with all my soul that I can help the pirates see reason. I cannot wait for the Council or risk them saying no. I see their ships approaching." -Here. -No! We must keep it. Fine. But so long as I live, no one will ever see it. [sighs] Why, Max? Why? My poor Uberta. [Uberta sobbing ] Why? -Why? -[poignant music playing] To tarnish Max's image for one misstep benefits no one. King Ivan and I agree Max's journal will remain private, hidden away. Why did he do it? I've known many a good king, but Max was the best of them all. I can only believe he thought it was the right thing to do. I can't go on. He alone believed in me. I cannot be a queen without my king. But don't you see, Uberta? You must go on. You must become the queen he knew you could be. I can't find Dad. Shouldn't you be at dinner, young man? -I already eated. -I see. You wanna play Catch & Fire till I find my dad? Yes, young prince. I will play Catch & Fire with you all the days of my life. Just today is good. [Rogers chuckles] [clears throat] My condolences, Queen Uberta. Thank you, Ivan. Max respected you. And I him. He was my better. So it pains me to say, I have been chosen as his replacement. You will do well. I'd feel more confident about that if you joined the Council. [arrow fires] [poignant music playing] [Max] ♪ You will be the queen of queens ♪ [music turns determined] I cannot join the Council, dear Ivan. I have a kingdom to run, a king to raise, and a queen to become. [Aubri exhaling and groaning] Geez. I hope I never have a baby. Well, I, um... Yes, me too. I just know you're going to have a boy. He and Derek will be the best little buddies. You're so kind to take care of me. [groans] -You're sweating. -Eh... I know. My dad said, "Never let them see you sweat." [baby coos] -Finally. -Finally. [tender music playing] So much for my predictions. -It's a girl? -What a bummer. Your people await the presentation of... Odette. [Uberta] Odette.

And as for you, young Derek, girls aren't as bad as you think. -[ominous music playing] -[door opens] -Oh, William. -No. No! [sombre music playing] Oh, Aubri! No! My darling Aubri! Poor dear. He hasn't eaten in days. Send for Queen Uberta. Okay, Bromley. As soon as you let go, say, "Now!" [poignant music playing] Thank you for coming, Your Highness. My dear William...

Who gave you that disaster? A crazy woman. Her dogs defeated my dogs, you see. But that wasn't enough. No! She pretended to be a famous singer! And when I got too close, she signed my arm with permanent ink! Then she removed her face! She sounds crazy, all right. Get working. Delete it! Now! Hurry! What if someone sees me here?

[dramatic music playing] [laughs haughtily] "Most memorable coronation"... indeed. [pensive music playing] [Uberta] T-minus 12 hours and counting, people. Let's move! Wow. Queen Bee has got the beehive buzzing. Ooh! Sounds exciting. Let's go. [upbeat music playing] -Chamberlain? -Yes. Isn't it wonderful? Oh, indeed. -Peonies? -They got here just in time. Yes. From south of the lands to the west. [laughing] I didn't think I could do it. But here it is, Course 20! [Rogers] What we do here tonight, friends, will be remembered for generations. -[cheering and whistling] -Yeah! Our grandchildren's grandchildren will tell the tale of our remarkable achievement! People are happiest when they're doing something great. May I present your coronation attire. Wow. Oh, chamberlain, I never imagined. -Ah, neither did I. -[Uberta laughs] And you're walking on air! Another side of the story. Thank you, Mother. [ominous music playing] Oh, that one's horrible. I'll take it. Oh, no. Actually, uh, we're saving that one for a farmer we know. Un-save it. It's mine now. But you'll be nice to it, won't you? [laughs] Nice? To a mutt like that? Queen Uberta says there are no mutts. They're all good dogs. I want every dog you have. Now! -[dogs crying] -[sombre music playing] No music? No thrones? Can you believe that? -Quite peculiar. -What did you expect? That's Uberta for you. -Uh... where have you been? -[laughs] [dramatic music playing] All clear here. Security 1 to Security 2, report. Security 2, all clear. Roger that. Security 3? Security 3? [sighs] Jean-Bob! [groans] Where is that frog? [hopeful music playing] If I'm being absolutely honest, I've impressed even myself. Take your places, men. The show starts at sunset.

[metal clangs] At least ze noise has stopped. [fireworks exploding] -Did I miss anything? -[Uberta sobbing] Oh, the poor dear. What happened to her? It would be cruel to let this event define Queen Uberta. For this day is just a moment in a grand story. A story about a woman who knew true love... and struggled through its loss. [tender music playing] Whose charity and kindness shine like a star. Her vision leaves a path for us to follow. Yes, tragedy has marked her life... but she has turned it each time to joy. The joy of loving... of giving... of helping. She has acquired the strength to stand tall... and the courage to fight. She has the charm of laughter. And the gift to lead. And the humility to kneel. Yes, this moment is just a moment, but this life will shine forever. She's Uberta, the queen of queens. [cheering and whistling] Thank you, Odette. But it is you, not me, who is the true queen of queens. [symphony playing uplifting music] I present to you King Derek and Queen Odette... the true queen of queens. [guests cheering and applauding] Incoming. Ha, ha! [grunts] [guests cheering and applauding] [dramatic music playing] Your Highness, there is a gentleman here to see you. Magnus. It's so good to see you. I have something for you, my dear queen. It is the finest work I have ever seen. [tender music playing] My dear Max. How I miss you. Derek, this is Magnus. The painter that Father saved. Yes. I see him in you. My father? [Magnus] As best as I can remember him, anyhow. You remembered well. It is his very image. I should return. [Rogers] Uh... Magnus, may I show you some of our newer portraits? First my mother and now your father. They've both come back to us. Yes. I have so few memories. Just flashes, really. Catch & Fire is just a king and young prince kind of thing. But I clearly remember, he loved me. [Magnus] I'm so sorry I missed Derek and Odette's coronation. After all these years, a new king and queen in Chamberg. Does King Derek know? No, he knows nothing.
