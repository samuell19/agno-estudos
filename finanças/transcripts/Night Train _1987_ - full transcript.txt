What's wrong with her? She's in labor! Is there a doctor or midwife on board? I can help. Please! Push! Push harder! Push! Don't ever let your baby go. A child is happiest with his parent. Thank you. Thanks. Dad! Was it born? Is it a boy or a girl? Girl! What is it? Mom died from a difficult childbirth. Watch out! Mom died from a difficult childbirth! Move from there! Keep her quiet. Stop crying. Dad gets scary when he's mad. Stop crying, I said. Put on your kimono. Dad, what are you going to do with Satoko? I won't forgive you, if you abandon her. I know. He gambled the money he got from selling his daughter, got drunk, and picked many fights. Some punks beat him to death. A truly sad way of dying! That's Satoko, my sister! I'll work hard and do anything you say. Please let me live with my sister. I want at least ten yen per month to raise her. Hand over the baby. No! I'm living with my sister! I'm going to take care of her! I said you can't do that! Didn't I explain it to you? The gay quarters is a place for men to enjoy themselves, without having to think about work and family. Her cries and diaper smell will spoil their fun. No! Stop! Satoko! "Dear Sister, thank you for writing to me. "It is the happiest news I've had from you. "So you will be coming back to Koch soon. "You left me in my foster parents care when I was "still an infant, and worked hard for 14 years to send me living expenses. "I'll finally get to see you soon. "I am choked with happiness." Welcome. What will you have? Udon noodles. What kind? Kake (plain). One plain bowl of noodles! Okay. And a bottle of sake. Add a bottle of sake to that! Okay! Ready! Thank you for waiting. Sister? Sister! You're my dear sister! I finally got to see you! It's been 14 years. I finally got to see you! Welcome! Thank you for your patronage. Show them in! I'll be working here again. Please be good to me. You're not strapped down in debt this time. But that doesn't matter... You are all the same in front of the customers. Work hard and set a good example to the young ones. Show us more legs! Good evening. Hello. This is her first night. Do you know her? Remember I had to go to Takamatsu recently? I met her on the train at that time. I didn't expect to see you again. It must be fate. Please have a drink. I'm Someyu. Please be good to me Show us more legs! What a disgusting bunch. Who are they? Some higher-ups in prison. They're letting us use the newcomers at a cheap price. If you show us skin up to your naval, we'll double the fees. Shall we go elsewhere to drink? Are you wooing me? That's right. Don't waste your time. You can buy me for ten yen per night. Shall we go upstairs? That wasn't my intention! Hurry. I'll keep you company. Okay! I'll pay ten yen. Forget it! I changed my mind! Keep warm or you'll catch a cold. What are you doing? Hurry, or you'll be late to school. I feel tired. Come to think of it, you were coughing last night. Did you catch a cold? It's nothing serious. Sister... I'm thinking of quitting school. What? I've been thinking about it for a long time. It's not right to me to go to school without a care when you're working so hard. Don't be silly! Good morning. Sorry about last night! I want to show you where I work! From now? Will you change and come out? My sister is sick with a cold. The fresh sea breeze will cure her right away. Come out quickly. This is where I work. Young Boss! Young Boss! Please wait here. Satoko... I'm a geisha. It's not an upright job that I can be proud of. You, at least, should graduate from school. My dream... ...is to give you a proper wedding. That's what kept me going until now. The bank called to say that the check from Toyo Construction Company has bounced. Is that true? Are you all right? Satoko, are you all right? Blood! She has a lung disease! Put your hips into it! This is stupid! A country geisha is acting like a dancing instructor! Look sharp! You're not good enough to perform for customers! Hanayu, who took the glory from you? Her! Why? And you're going to let it go at that? You call yourself my sister? How pathetic! She decided on it! Are you the senior geisha? I'm Someyu. I'm Otatsu, Domeki Ryunosuke's wife. Will you tell me why you demoted my sister? I thought Kimika was a better dancer than her. We're in the middle of dance practice now. Please leave. Hey! Who do you think you are talking to? I think Hanayu is the best dancer here. Your lousy judgment caused my sister shame! You're going to pay for this! Let's start from the very beginning again! I've gathered the best entertainers in Osaka! That's good! Domeki! Thought you could get away without my approval? Get lost before you get hurt! Welcome! Welcome back. Boss, I have a favor to ask you. Please lend me some money. I'll return twice the amount in three months. What big talk! You call us "yakuza scums!" You sworn you wouldn't become one of us! But you're trying to borrow money from the yakuza! You've got the gall to come here to borrow money! Leave. Kick him out! I shouldn't have come here, after all. Young Boss! What are you doing? Tell my dad I'm taking it as severance! Young Boss! Bento and tea for sale! Are you sure? About what? Aren't you busy with work? Did I inconvenience you by asking you to come along? Didn't you leave your sister in the hospital? She's being taken care of by the hospital. There's nothing I can do for her anyway. Are you hungry? Bento! Two deluxe bento. Two tea. Thank you! What's the matter? I have a lot of money. See? I have more in this pocket. It's spilling out. See! Stop that! I can't hear it... I'm going to Manchuria to ride the train to Europe. You're a true "tenkuro." What's a "tenkuro"? It means you have black hands. Say what you want. I'm serious. I'm going to ride it with you. Thanks for saying that. I won't count on it though. You can count on it. This sound... ...of the night train... It's the sound I remember when my dad first took me on the night train. When a man is making love to me... I can always hear this sound in the back of my ears. So I never felt love with any of them. It was the first time... I didn't hear this sound in the back of my ears. I felt something passionate as you held me in your arms. You are the first man to arouse emotions in me... Yet... Yet... I wish we could go off somewhere from here. Leaving your sister behind? That's right. Aren't I a bad sister? You sure are. Will you marry me? Life would be great if I married you... I'll take you to Manchuria. I don't want to stay in the boondocks of Koch. Let's go to Manchuria. Are you going to get another advance? Where are you going? Kanazawa. How much are you borrowing? 1,200 yen. The doctor said I needed to admit her into a specialized hospital to get her cured. 1,200 yen... It's painful for me, too. I don't want to part with you. What do you want at this hour? I need your help. Please lend me money. What? You want to borrow money from me? Have you gone crazy? I need to raise 1,200 yen. I know about your shady side. If I report it... You'll end up behind bars. Then it won't be funny at all. The Jail Warden came crying to me. Will you let him go with this? No deal! I heard you left your dad's place because you despised the yakuza business. I didn't think you'd resort to extortion like this! Like father, like son! Did you wait long? I'm going to get the money. I'll deliver the 1,200 yen to you in the next couple days. You won't have to go to faraway Kanazawa now. I hope you're not going to be in trouble for it later. Don't worry about it I'm the boss of "tenkuro." I can raise that amount of money with no problems. Milk, please! Call the police. Masa... Forgive me... You've ended up in jail because of me... Sister... How long will I be in the hospital? Will I end up being bedridden and die? Don't be silly. I heard that lung diseases are incurable. The doctor said you can be cured. He's lying! If I'm going to die anyway... Don't keep me in the hospital and spend money. I don't want to trouble you to that extent. Just leave me to die alone! Don't be so weak-willed! Are you all right? Don't worry . Listen to me. Be strong. You must fight with your illness. I'll work hard so that I can come back soon. Do you understand? Lamenting that this year again will not clear... The life of at a dewdrop "Satoko, how are you feeling?" "I'm sorry to send you the money late. "Enclosed is 50 yen "Please eat something good and recuperate. "I'm doing my best here."

You're endured it in there very well. We have a rickshaw waiting. The Boss is anxiously waiting for you. Please show him your face. I'm not going home. Tell my dad that.

I can't believe it's true! Can I realty live here? I'll find you a better place later. Bear with it for now. Thank you for everything. I'll make dinner Eat with me. It's to celebrate my hospital discharge. I'll buy what you need. Thanks. Another match. Let's bet 100 yen. Sure. You go first. Get serious! Do you want to get killed? You're the one who raised the bet to 100 yen per game. Don't tell me that you don't have the money to pay up! Don't take me lightly because I'm an outsider. What else can I say if don't have the money? Do as you wish with me. The next time you pull something like this again, I'm going to kill you. Masa.l What are you doing? Stop it! Don't mistake me for my sister! That's not it! I want you! No! Or I won't be able to face my sister! Stop it! She's not coming back. No! You'll catch my illness! Stop it! I don't care! I'll take that illness away from you. Sister... Excuse me! Sister... Satoko! How awful of you! You just told me you were being discharged soon, and you wrote nothing after that. I didn't even know about this address. I couldn't even notify you that I was returning soon. I'm sorry. Can I come in? Yes. I'm sorry. How are you feeling? Good. I'm glad to hear that. Are you sewing at home? I didn't know you could sew. Don't overwork yourself. You need a lot of rest. Satoko... Let me see your face. I haven't seen you in three years. It's been long, hasn't it? You've gotten very feminine. You're an adult now. You can get married anytime. I'll make tea. Do you, by chance... have a man that you love? Who is it? What is he like? Is it someone that I know? Are you living with him? Satoko? Sister! Please forgive me! What's the matter? What happened? Sister! Please forgive me! I don't know what you mean. Tell me. No! I don't believe it. It can't be... I'm at fault. I forced myself on her. I'm to blame for it. Sister... Forgive me! I feel badly towards you. You were too far away. Satoko and I couldn't help ourselves. We can't tum back now. I don't want to hear it! Sister! Wait! Sister! Dear... The waves look rough. Maybe a typhoon is on its way. What are you going to do from now? I'll ask the Madam to let me work at her place again. It must be trying for you. I don't know what I feel. I feel empty inside. Drink this. Thank you for coming today. I've been waiting for you. Haven't seen you in a long time. President, we have the best geisha in Koch here. Aren't they different from the modem girls from Tokyo? The Tokyo women are smug. I didn't care for them. The best women are the passionate ones. Tosca women are known to be passionate. They're also pretty and good entertainers. Will you watch her dance? Someyu! Madam, I feel like I've met her before. So you remember her! When you used to patronize us before you went to Tokyo... She was still in training. Her first customer was you. I remember now. Her hands were trembling as she served sake to me. And she spilled the sake on my lap. She was good at arm wrestling. She said she was strong as a fisherman' s daughter. But you easily beat her. She was so mortified! She's always been strong-willed. So she's always been a great performer. So she's that girl... She acts big because she's good at dancing! She should stay in the back as an old lady. But she likes to take the show. That is why her sister stole her beloved man. The blood must have shot up her head. How troublesome to us! You're in no position to talk. What do you mean by that? Everyone knows that you became the mistress to Boss Domeki, like your older sister. So the two sisters are mistresses to the same man! That's right! We are close as sisters. So we don't fight or betray the other over a man. It's disgraceful to fight between blood relatives! What was that for! I won't forgive you for it! Stop it! Stop fighting! What do you think you are doing? I feel refreshed. Young Boss! All of Japan is enrapt in this show now. We got this flyer from Tokyo. An American aviator has incorporated loops and spins in a spectacular aerobatic performance. It's become a big attraction. You want to do it in Koch? Something of this magnitude... is going to require a lot of funds. And there'll be a lot of competition. Domeki is trying to obtain the rights from Osaka. Stop hiding out here. Please come back and help the Boss. Please come back, Young Boss. If a plane makes aerobatic feats in the skies... the people will get excited. I'd want to see ft, too. I heard you used to work as a bus conductor. I was the first female conductor in the city. I wore fancy hats and high heel shoes. The people would ride the bus just to see me. How did you end up here? I wonder why. The men would pamper me because I was different. Before I knew it, I was in this place. I always liked to be different from others. Falling in love with a drifter like you... might be a continuation of that. Would you like to drift with me? Kogiku! How dare you embarrass me! Kogiku belongs to Bonten Shinji from today! I won't let you touch her! Dear! It's beautiful, isn't it? You can go back to the Tamura house. I'll be waiting for you forever. I'm used to waiting alone. You don't mind if I become a yakuza? You can become a yakuza or robber... But that doesn't change who you are. I'll follow you all the way. Don't worry . My house is in that poor tenements. That's the only home that I have. I'm not leaving you... Ever! Stay out of the way! Excellent! True music to my ears! Thank you. Come here and have a drink with me. I've been back for a month now. I've been busy with my father's funeral, and making my rounds to the bosses here. I finally feel like I'm at home today. The sake tastes great. I'll be glad to keep you company any time. You're an interesting woman. You make me feel completely at ease here. Did you know that I liked you from the time you were still in training? President, I might take you seriously on it. A lie as it may be, it s making me feel excited. Shall we? What? Arm wrestle. I'll see how strong you have become. Sure! I'm not going to lose. I'll take you on. Ready? You haven't gotten any stronger. Let me try again. Ready? You must've been through a lot. President... that's not fair. That took my strength away. I'm going to the bathroom. Are you Boss Tamura? What do you want? Die! Help! Boss! Boss! I just got word from Bonten Shinji... That it went well. I see. Good. Koch now belongs to me. Kanda is here. Please pay your respects to him. Congratulations. I see you are doing very well. Thank you. I owe it to you. That dress makes you look very sexy. It feels airy at the bottom. Does it mean you're wearing nothing underneath? Oh, my! Can you see? It's true that the Madam': patron is Mr. Mizugami. Who cares about that. Let's drink up. That's the president of Nankai Bank for you! He buys a shop of this magnitude for his mistress! Will you stop talking about others? I might take you seriously. Excuse me. What is it? I have to use the bathroom. I'm impressed with what I see. I didn't think you had it in you. That's because I have your great support on it. I'm just doing as I want. Tonight... No, I can't. I'm going home. I'm going home now. Thank you for your hard work. I thought I saw Yoshimura. Did something happen? No. He was just jealous. I'm thinking of breaking up with him. But he's an earnest man. That's what's bad. He's starting to hold me back. A man should be bad to some point. Kanda, with the silver-rimmed spectacles... is an usurer. Are you switching over to him? You fall in love then break up... Then you fall in love again and break up again... Why do we do the same thing over and over again? Will it be like this till we die? It's sad between a man and a woman. I'm sorry but we're closed. I'm going home now. Good night. I heard about your father. My sympathies to you. Do you want a drink? No, thanks. Is Satoko doing fine? Please take care of her. I'm not upset anymore. I was wrong. About you and Satoko. I drew my own conclusions. I came to ask you for your help. I realize that I'm in no position to ask you. But I really need your help. Will you introduce me to the president of Nankai Bank? Why do you want to see Mizugami? I've decided to take over my dad's business. My dad was planning to call over the infamous aerobatic performers to Koch this autumn. He went to Osaka for that and was killed... I've never done anything filial until now. So I want to make my dad's dream come true. To do that... I need the help of the president of Nankai Bank. I know I'm being selfish. Please help me out. Masa, you've changed. What happened to your dream of going to Manchuria? Did you decide to become a yakuza that you loathed? Yes. I've thought over carefully and decided on it. I'm a scum and a "tenkuro." I fell in love with you, and while I waited for you, I raped your younger sister. I'm a hopeless villain. And I know that. I won't make excuses for myself. I won't ask you for your forgiveness. But I want to do this for my dad and Satoko. I want to be a man again. Will you help me become a man? Please help me out. Do you think that would make Satoko happy? Unlike me, you are the first and only man for Satoko. She only has you. Is it that important to become a man? You're selfish! Don't you care about how the woman feels? Will you please let me see the president? An aerobatics performance, here in Shikoku? You're a true "tenkuro." I don't know what to say. President, your car is here. Don't worry about the money. I'll take care of it. Will you really? You need that much spirit. Take it as far as you can. Thank you. Thanks. I was wondering what would happen to the Tamura Gang, after the Boss had such a brutal death. With you as his successor, the gang is secure. You have our full backup on the aerobatic performance. You'll surely do well. I'll be counting on your help. Tonight... I can't. I'll just call you at home. Know your place. Or you might lose this shop. I hate you! What are you doing? I told you not to come here! Leave! Please die with me! Stay out of the way! Yoshi! Hang in there! I'm sorry! Forgive me! Your companion is here. Please go in. Masa, so you came... "I'm lonely. I want to die." "If you don't come right away, I will kill myself." You've sent me three telegrams this morning. What's going on with you? I wanted to see you very badly. Don't be stupid. Stupid? That's right! You should know the position that I'm in right now! What do you want? If there's nothing, I'm leaving. You don't care what happens to me? You have the president! He's far better than me! But I want you! I can't forget about you! It's over between us! That's what you told me. That's what I thought... Or tried to think. But I can't lie to myself. Do you remember this room? This is where we spent our first night together. I went crazy after that night. You drove me crazy. What happened to you? Things have changed since. You have the president... and I have Satoko. You can't make love to me in fear Mizugami? Or do you cherish Satoko that deeply? I don't care what happens with Mizugami or Satoko. Satoko is the only younger sister that you have. I don't care. I want to get you back! I want you! My heart yearns for you! I'm not letting you go! You are my man! Seven bento and tea. Thank you for waiting! The airplanes are here! We'll begin the performance! Will you come here? So you're here, too. I just came. When a woman open her legs, she can get a storehouse of wealth. That's what I believed from when I was a mere trainee. I'd get together with a man, argue about money, break off with him, then find another man. I thought it was about time I put an end to such a lifestyle. That is why I was planning to many Yoshimura. If you want to open your own shop, I'll help you. Thanks. But Yoshimura comes from a fisherman's family in Yanagawa. Are you going to become a fisherman's wife? I'm originally from a fisherman's family, too. Yes, I forgot. So am I. I'm going. Goodbye. Goodbye. I wish you happiness. Thank you. Who's responsible for it! The airplanes! I know that. The airplanes are fully my responsibility. I know I've incurred a great loss to you. Please give me three more days. I didn't think you were coming today. Where are you going? To that man's place? I know about it. I've done a lot for you. I even lent him a hand. How could you betray me like this? I didn't think you were so rotten to the core! All you did for me... was to give me the excess cash that you didn't need. Did you seriously think you could buy love? You don't understand a woman's feelings. The president called me in today and told me not to come to him again. He found out about us. You can't count on him anymore. Is that why he cut his ties with me? He must given you a bad time. Don't worry about me. Won't you be in trouble if you can't raise the money? I think I can help you. Never mind already. I've been nothing but trouble to you. I'm a pathetic man. I'm happy to have met a man like you. Welcome home. You must be tired. Are you hungry? No. I ate with the others. Do you want sake? Not today. I'll make you tea. You have a beard. Shall I shave it for you? With it, you look even more tired. Sorry. Please lend me whatever you can for my body... You can't dance or play the shamisen... Your only choice is the brothels. Are you sure about that? I'm sure you have your deep reasons for it, but once you get in, you won't be able to get out. I know. Please send me as far away as possible from Koch. All right. Take it off. Jake off your kimono and show me your body. I don't mind paying for a beauty like you, but I want to make sure you don't have any hidden marks. Hurry and take it off. Truly beautiful! You have the nicest body I've ever seen! What do you say to it? I can't use this shop as collateral. I have to pass it through Mizugami first. The shop is under my name. There should be no problems. Mizugami and I are in the same financial business. If he becomes my enemy, I won't be able to survive. Sorry, but I can't help you out with it. How pathetic! And you're feared for your ruthless lending tactics. You only wag your tail to the powerful. I'm going. What is it? Money. I don't have time, so please give it to him for me. It may not be much, but this is the most I can raise. How did you get this? Don't tell me you...? I think of myself as his wife. As a yakuza's wife... It's only natural that I help him by selling my body. What a foolish thing to do! Do you know what that means? Yes, I do. I'll be doing what you did. As frustrating as it is, there's nothing else I can do. Are you trying to get back at me? You call yourself his wife? You're going to sell yourself for your husband? Don't make me laugh! You make it seem like you're carrying all the burden alone! Do you know what I've been through for you? No, you don't! You robbed me of my dreams, man, and happiness! Sister... I have to go now. Goodbye. Wait a minute! Don't go! What are you doing! Satoko! Get out of the way! Don't go! So it's you. I'll make you confess who's behind you. Come! No! He's mine! I'm not letting him go! Dear! What are you doing! Young Boss! Don't kill him! Young Boss! Stop it! Hold her down! Please! You've been sold to him! Please. Please stop it! Please! What's wrong with her? Masa, I'm going. Please forgive me. Please return my sister. So the Tamura Gang has really fallen. Have they sent a woman in fear of me? I have no relations with the Tamura Gang. I only came for her as her only family member. Please! Please let me have my younger sister back. As much as I'd like to get rid of that worthless woman with a lung disease... I paid good money for her! I'll do whatever I want with her body! Please accept this. If this isn't enough, I'll raise more. Are you taking me lightly? Do you think money will resolve everything? What do you want me to do? I'll do whatever! can. What can I do to make you return my sister? I'll even take her place. You've got to be kidding. You've lived in this field for many years, at the mercy of countless men. Why would the boss want an old geisha like yourself? What do you want of me? If you were a man, I'd have you cut a finger off. But I can't even ask that of you. Now you know that there's nothing you can do here! Bring that Tamura kid here! You, a woman, isn't fit to settle matters here! Just get lost! Are women that worthless? I want to save my one and only sister... but you won't let me? Stop being persistent! Will you return my sister if I cut my finger off? What? That sounds interesting! Let's have her cut it off. This is a sight to see. Let's see you do it. What the matter? Do it quickly. Do it! You be quiet! A woman can't be afraid of blood! Is this what it takes to be a man? Is this what it takes to be forgiven? Are you all right? Sister... Let's go home. Thank you, Sister... Sister, this... What happened? It's nothing. Is it because of me? I'm sorry. Are you all right? You poor thing... It must've been hard on you. I had much more painful times in life... When I was apart from you... When I betrayed you... Hang in there. You must hang in there. My husband... Where is he? Masa... got hurt. Hun? Don't worry about him. He's being treated at the hospital now. He'll be well soon. How did he get hurt? He tried to come for you. And he got injured by Domeki's men. He came for me? Really? Of course. He'll be with you when he's well again. Thanks, Sis. I know... that before, now, and in the future... the woman that he truly loves from his heart... isn't me, but you. What are you saying? Masa is your man. Will you listen to me? You will live your life with all his love... I will live my life being in love with him... I don't care if I burn out. I can live with just my love for him. Sister! I want to ride a train. I rode one as an infant, didn't I? I want to ride again with you... ...and go somewhere. Let's ride the train together.. And go somewhere. Sister! Please stay by my side. Please stay with me. I know. Don't leave me again! We'll always be together. The train is coming. I see a lot of smoke! Sis... I see a train coming. A train is coming! "Two months have since I left Koch without telling you goodbye. "I went to the front of the hospital in hopes of having a glance of you. But I was afraid I'd have deep attachments for you, "so I left without going in. Please forgive me. "After Satoko died, it made me realize how important she was. "Even you won't be able to fill this void in me. "In fact, I shouldn't let you fill that void. "For Satoko's sake, who have lived her life in love for you, "I must live on my own. "I am in Manchuria now. "It's freezing cold here. "When you step out of town, the fields extend endlessly. "Heaven and Earth look gray. "I can see the railway tracks that you told me about "extending straight ahead endlessly. "I am here in Manchuria, where you wanted to go badly. "It must be fate. "I'm happy to have met you. "It was the greatest happiness for me. "As far away as I may be from you... "Knowing that you are well... "is what's keeping me going in life. "Please take good care of yourself. "Goodbye. "Dear Tamura Masahiko... From Okazaki Tsuyuko." The Imperial Forces have bombed Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, United States! You have a telegram from Japan. Everyone': waiting for you. I'll be right over. Masahiko has died. August, 1945 Okazaki Tsuyuko known as geisha Someyu, operates a brothel in a town on the Soviet-Manchurian border. In the chaos of crushing defeat, no one hears from her. THE END
