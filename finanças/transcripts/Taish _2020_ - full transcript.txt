We could have all died today. I'll send Di (sister) back to the US tomorrow. You, Shozi and Arfa stay away from this. I'll handle Pali. He attacked Di, Rohan. I'll first kill his brother. Then him. We will have to do something. - Kill him. - You can't beat him. Pali will stop him. And for how long will we keep running? We will have to do something now. What do you mean? I mean we have to stop this cunt somehow. Anyhow. And whatever we do, we'll do it together. - But Rohan... - You were right. We will have to send Di and Arfa far away from here. Maybe even Shozi. Arfa's not gonna understand. I am the one who started this and I am the one who will end it. Don't get involved. You don't get involved in this. Please. Don't get involved? Whether we want it or not, we are all involved in it. But I don't want to lose you like I did Krish. That's why I am telling you, whatever we do, we'll do it together. But we will do it properly, we will think it through. Let's finish this. My boys have been looking for you all over and you came here?! I need a favor from you. I wouldn't give you and Sunny death even if you beg for it. - I'll have you two... - Pali, listen to me. Leave us alone. Please. I'll take Sunny and we'll go somewhere far away. We will never come before you again. Promise. Whatever that happened was wrong. I agree to that. But we can't stop that. Give me a chance, please. You guys started this buy attacking my brother. And I will end this. And I will end this soon. We didn't start this, Pali. Your brother Kuljinder started this. We lost many things in this fight, Pali. But I lost more than you ever will. - Sanober. - Yes Pali. Did you know Kulli had forced himself on a ten-year-old boy? Did you know that he used to do that to kids? Tell me. Tell me! I knew. Tell me. Do you know why are we here? Quiet. Rohan! Hey, Rohan! Are you alright? Yeah. I am not fine either. Let's play ping-pong. Sunny? There's a time for everything. And it's time for ping-pong now. I'll serve. I blame myself everyday, for Krish and Mahi's death. Come on, Rohan. I wish forgiving someone was easier than blaming someone. We always keep blaming ourselves. But the fact is, that Krish and Mahi are dead. Since the past two years, I keep thinking about just one thing. I wish it were the other way around. Krish should have survived and I should have died. And every day, I keep thinking that I wish hadn't told you anything. Then why did you? Why did you tell me, Rohan? You know I'm like a matchstick in a gunpowder factory. And yet, you told me such a thing. I know. Have you lost your freakin' mind? Where did you get this from? - Relax. Relax. - Motherfucker. Relax? This time we will go fully prepared. There will be no fuck ups. - Let me have that. - Why? For safety. Let me have that. You think that I am crazy, don't you? Yes. Yes. Everyone thinks so. The pain inside me doesn't heal, Rohan. And it won't heal till I don't get Pali punished. Okay, fine. But let go. Give me the... You can take it tomorrow, when we come back here to kill Jassi. Let me have it in the meanwhile. Okay? - Rohan? - Yes. Don't come with me tomorrow, if you don't want to. I'll totally understand. It's totally okay. No, I'll come with you tomorrow. You won't go alone, I'll come. - Okay. - Okay. Where are you going? We go together tomorrow. Today I go alone, to the washroom. Hey. Hey, Di. Rohan, I'm with Dr. Pandey. Are you alone? Oh hello, doctor. Yeah. Is everything set for tomorrow? We cannot admit someone without proper consent... ...but I know that this is a special case. You can get him. We will manage it. Our centre is quite well-equipped. I'll make some excuse and bring him to the centre tomorrow. We might have to lock him up. We may have to sedate him. Lock him? We'll have to lock in here at the centre? So, I'll... Di... Di, don't worry. I'll stay there as long as it takes. Rohan, you will be with him, right? Yes. This is the only option left. It will take some time. But... - Oh, shit! - Hello, Rohan? What happened? - I'll call you back. - Rohan? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Come on Sunny, pick up. Pick up the fuckin' phone. Come on. Pick up the phone. Shit! Fuck! Shit... Fuck! Man, what the fuck. Get the fuck off. Get the fuck off. Sunny! No! Don't. I'll take both of you. Jassi has... Let it be, Pali. Why do you want to see it? I'll send you a picture. Is it enough? Should I disconnect... Don't disconnect the call, Sukhi! Make it quick, Pali. Let me see. Let me watch it. Jassi was your responsibility, Sukhi. I'm going to get out and kill those two bastards. But before that, I'll fuckin' kill you! I'll kill you! What have I done? Jassi! What have I done... what the fuck! You know you don't have to do this. I can't believe I have To explain this to you, Rohan. You can still walk away. There is still a chance. - It's okay too late. - Not anymore. Di's already taken a flight back. You too should go be with your father. What time? Alright, thanks. Pali's out. Pali, why did you escape from jail? The police came looking for you. They will come back. You should leave. Where's Jahaan? Good that you came here, son. Jassi is gone, and you know what state Kulli is in. We are all alone, Pali. Sukhi, talk to him. - Pali... - Where's Jahaan? Pali... Pali is here. Do you wish to meet him? Rohan! Rohan! What are you doing? Let's go. Come on. Let's go. Pali... I am done living for others. This time, you come with me. Yes. Please don't say no. Please don't. The flight leaves tomorrow morning. Pali, don't wait until tomorrow morning, leave tonight. Pali... We know where his lawyer friend is. We will soon know where those two are. I won't leave in that flight alone. Yeah? Jahaan, if you don't come... ...then I'll kill myself. I won't ask again. Jahaan... You should get out of here. Go away. "We'll build a house together..." "Me and you." "Under a thatched roof, me and you." "Locked in an embrace, me and you." "Lost in each other's eyes..." Me and you... Pali. Don't you want to meet your brother Kulli? If I see him... ...I'm afraid I'll kill him. - But Pali... - Sanober... You take care. I'll in touch with you. "I am alive," "but barely" "There is no support," "There is nothing to hang on to" "I'll breathe my last," "as I embark to a new journey" "Look at the stars," "I am immortal" "I am alive," "but barely" "There is no support," "Nothing..." "There is nothing..." Stay with me, stay with me, Sunny. Stay with me, Sunny. Hey, call an ambulance! Rohan... - You okay? - Yeah, call an ambulance! Hey, Sunny. Sunny, look at me. Look at me. Stay with me. "I am alive," You're gonna be fine. You will be fine. Stay with me. Rohan... Do you forgive me? Yes. Do you forgive me? "I am alive," Do you forgive me? Do you forgive me? You bastard... Yes, I forgive you. "I am alive," I have forgiven you. I forgive you. - I did, I did forgive you. - "but barely" Get up. "There is no support," "There is nothing to hang on to" "I am alive," "but barely"
