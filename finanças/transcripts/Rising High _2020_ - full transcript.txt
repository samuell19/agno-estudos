But not if you don't like the money. For 38 euros, you can sleep in the container. -No, forget it. -You'd rather sleep on the streets? I'll find a place. We can't defer your tax payments again. We can only do that once. Yes, but the painting season hasn't started yet. It might be best if you paid your tax and found yourself a job. -That's not all that bad. -Working for who? Ms. Liebholz, I look at you and I see a woman with a big heart. Children see the truth. Thanks, Viktor. -That's kind of you. -This pile here... That's the bad pile, right? You could say that. Just take my dad's file... and place it right at the bottom. No one will notice. Okay. That was amazing, Viktor. Great.

Please transfer the tax by the deadline. Thank you. Dad? Are we poor now? It will all work out in the end. And if it doesn't work out, it's not the end. -Hey, Dad. -Viktor, how are you? -I'm good, Dad. -What's up? Where are you staying? In a flatshare with this crazy couple. -Artists. -Right. Are the walls painted at least? Woodchip wallpaper. Torn in places. -Have you found work? -Of course. I worked in a kiosk at first. And now I'm in a copy shop. Viktoria Steiner, hello. Hello? Viktor, is that you? Viktor? I've been trying to reach you. Why don't you return my calls? The neighbors must be wrong. I don't listen to music. I hate music. If there's one thing I hate, it's music. -Keep the change. -Thanks. Okay. Hello! Stop. Stop. Hey, stop! What the hell is going on? He's not blond. Who told me he was blond? His hair's light brown at best. -Light brown. -Hey, Blondie. Police! What's going on? Who's Dirk Diggler? -That's him. -Come on. Come with me. POLICE Dirk Diggler is a porn star, right? -He was my teenage hero. -Mine too. -I'm Viktor. -Gerry. -How much did you earn off the Bulgarians? -Four thousand. -A month? -A day. I've got ten of those flats. -When do you get paid? -End of the week. Not this week. They'll be in Bulgaria tomorrow. -How do you know? -I'm the one who brings them here. Why did you tell him everything? I just liked him. Have you never had that? Not to the extent that I'd share my criminal schemes with someone. I'm sharing them with you. That's true. So you like me, too? We'll see. Spaghetti or chips? Spaghetti with ketchup. -Brothels? -Sometimes. Have you called your mom this week? I choose the vodka option. -That wasn't five sips. -Yes, it was. Part of it was spit. There you go. Have you ever screwed over a mate? Vodka option. Cheers, Gerry. Cheers, Viktor. I'm coming. Take it easy. Well, how are you, man? I've got guests. Memo and Maria. See, it's all lined up. Only the best for my friends. That's good stuff. No, not for me. Hey, what's going on? I thought we were partying. Leave him. He wants to keep control. Are you his mom? Come on, let's party. What's this about? Come on. There you go. Come on, guys. I'm buying. Let's have a drink. Come on. Vamos. We've got guests. Gerry and Viktor. Cheers. Salute. Here's to a good night! Let's go mad! Take a deep breath. Here. Chewing gum. Stop shaking. Take your shoes off. Are you serious? There are kids here. So? They're my kids. Let go. -Good morning. -Morning. Being silly again? -Let me introduce you... -Hi. -to the most beautiful woman in the world. -Hi, I'm Katja. -Can Viktor stay with us for a few days? -Sure. You smell like a bum, darling. -Thanks. Love you too. -Welcome. Look, this is Julio. That's Cesar. Named after the best defender Borussia Dortmund ever had. Say hello. -Hello. -Hello. Hello. -Cup of tea? -A cuppa, yes. -Good for the head. -That would be lovely. Do you know why the Bulgarians moved in with you? -Because it was cheap. -Rubbish. I found them flats for five euros. But they went with you. And why? Because you're outrageously good-looking. -You look impressive. -Nonsense. -Give me your watch. -Hey. That's mine. Take a look at the watch. What does it look like? Like a 50 euro watch. Give me your arm. And straight away... it looks like a 13,000 euro watch. Like it's genuine. Gerry, what are you trying to say? I can get hold of anything in the world at a price that is so low... that if you sell it on, we could end up stinking rich, understand? Why don't we get into property? I'll find the properties and you'll sell them. I look at you and I know you can do it. I'm not so sure. It's not that bad. Come with me. Viktor Steiner. I'm the debtor's solicitor. -We're late. Can we go through? -Get to the back. -Don't talk to my lawyer like that. -To the back or you'll be reprimanded. Okay, okay. Lot number 232. Opening bid, 10,000 euros. Ten thousand. Any other bids? Twenty thousand. Any other bids? Sold. Opening bid, 10,000 euros. Any other bids? 20,000. Any other bids? Sold. Opening bid, 8,000 euros. Any other bids? Any other bids? Sold.

COURT OFFICER Thanks, man. Have a good one. Good morning. -Morning. -Good morning. Lot number 3215. Opening bid, 8,000 euros. Eight thousand. Any other bids? No, not from me. Just don't say anything. Thanks. First time at 8,000, second time at 8,000, and third time at 8,000. Lot number 3215 is now sold. Congratulations. Lot number 6543. Opening bid, 15,000 euros. -Yes, I'll take it. -Just raise your hand. Fifteen thousand. Any other offers? First time at 15,000, second time at 15,000, and third time at 15,000. -Lot 6543 is now sold. -Yeah! Lot number 87689. -Twenty flats... -We're done. Let's go. 350,000 euros. We're done. Let's go. 350,000. Are you crazy? Smile, and you'll conquer the world. First time at 350,000, second time at 350,000 and third time at 350,000. Lot number 87689 is now sold. -Where will you get the 350,000? -That's what banks are for. -What bank is going to lend us money? -No bank. That's what I don't understand. We've got ten working days to transfer the money. We'll sell the flats to people who can afford them. Or not. Doesn't matter. The main thing is that our buyers get a mortgage. So we need a bank that will lend them the money. They'll give it to us. We'll give it to these guys. That's where you come in. Do you know a bank that would go along with that? -Excuse me. Where are you going? -We have an appointment. -With whom? -With the person we're seeing. Stop! Stop! -Hey, Nicki. -Gerry. -Do you know these gentlemen? -Yes. I know them. You can close the door on your way out. Apologies, my mistake. You're forgiven. Thanks. Ms. Kleber. Hello, my dear Nicole. I'm Viktor Steiner. I'm so pleased to meet you. Nicole Kleber. Right, good. Is everything sorted? I've already told you I can't help. Don't give me the "good employee" act. My hands are tied. You sold me the wrong homework in year three. I had to repeat a year. -That would've happened anyway. -You stole a year of my life. -Can't you help us? -The amount is too small. -It's not worth it. -What amount would be worth it? -Three to four million. -Yeah, right. You used to walk dogs for a fiver. -We can manage that. -You can manage that? She's taking the piss. I know others. Let's go. Of course we can manage that. You mean you can find people who will take out mortgages worth three to four million euros? It'll be six million. Are your properties worth that? Twenty flats at 300,000 euros each makes six million. You just need to ensure they get the mortgages. If you pull that off, I'm in. And that was it. You need a person who has money or access to money. Someone who believes in you. It's like a stopcock. Someone has to open it for you. You can't do it alone. And with money, once someone's opened the stopcock, the more you have, the more you get. It never stops. It's like an avalanche. People throw it at you. You don't have to pay for anything. You get suits, parties, drugs for free. But not at the beginning. I can't do it. I sell life insurance, not property. You know that, Gerry. Keep my card. Maybe you'll get in touch more often. You won't have to do anything. Exactly. Just send your solvent clients to this address at 2 p.m. on Saturday. Fifty people. No more. They want to invest. I sell 200 policies a year. That means that I make 200,000 euros a year. I won't risk that for your crackpot idea. What's that after tax? Fifty thousand? Then you've got to pay rent. Then there's your weird cleaning lady, Priscilla. That's nothing. Fifty thousand euros per apartment. -Is that a joke? -Think about it. Hello, Mr. Schütter. How are you? I'll punch him until he agrees. What kind of friend is that? He wants 1,5 million. -I really am going to punch him. -He won't get a cent from us. I'm in a quick meeting. I'll be in touch afterwards. Yes, looking forward to it. Thanks. Bye. That's how it's done. -So, how's it looking? -Not good. -Getting cold feet? -You want 1,5 million from us. Really? -Let's say one million. -No. -500,000. My last offer. -You tell him, Viktor. -No. -No, really? You want to use my clients to get rich and I'm not getting anything? Gerry? 250,000 and it's a deal. Come on. 200,000. I can't go any lower. -Do you know what you don't get? -What? My arsehole is smaller than yours. What are you talking about? You've never been inside. Stupid wanker. TARUN INSURANCE -Have you done this before? -Nope. You? -Me neither. -Great. What could possibly go wrong? Close the door. What a moron. -Whatever. Where are the filing cabinets? -Gone. Looks like he's gone digital. He's so stupid. He won't have a password. Shit. Tell me his password. He's your friend. 12345. Try "password". Password. -Let me have a go. -Maybe he's written it down. Bayern Munich? Effenberg. -No. -Kahn. Jens Jeremies. You won't know him. -Lizarazu. -How do you spell "Liza"? With a "z". No. -Try "Merkel". -We've tried that. Shit. You're such idiots. When you waltzed into my office I knew you'd fuck it up. Nicki, nothing's lost. It's all been set in motion. There's no going back. It's my arse on the line, not yours. So, Mr. "We-can-manage-that"? Nothing's lost yet. We've got enough time. You're full of shit. -Do you have Tarun's email address? -Yeah. -Give it here. -Yes. How will that help us? Right, quiet, please. Do you do this a lot? Or how can you afford all this? I'm paying in installments, Gerry, now shut up. CRYING BABY Hello? Is this customer services? I'm sorry. Could you repeat that, please? My baby's crying. Hush, it's okay. Everything's okay, sweetie. My husband was in a car accident. He's abroad and I need to access his emails, so I can pass on information about his health insurance policy. I've got no idea how serious it is. I'm just... I'm just so overwhelmed. I have to enter a password, but I don't have one. Tarun Kanashina. I'm Silke Kanashina. I don't think he added me, because I didn't want him to. Thank you so much. Thank you. May Shiva answer all your prayers. The password for his contacts is "Lothar". Get out. I want to watch my series. -You're the best trickster I know. -Yeah, off you go. Go. We produced a brochure and sent it out by email. It looked perfect. Even you would have come to view a flat. -I don't think so. -Why not? Journalists don't earn much. That was the first sentence... "You think you don't earn enough to buy a flat? Then think again. Buy a flat and reclaim the money from the tax office." It was perfect. It's clearly a scam. I might as well give my account details to a Nigerian prince. We lied a lot, but the bit about the tax office was true. That part was legal. -Looks pretty good. -Maybe we should keep two flats. It's too far east for me. We're in deep shit now. Call Baba Sultan. What's the point, genius? Get up, you slackers. Come on. VARNISH Gerry. -Get up. Come on. Get dressed. -Oh, man. Baba, get out. We want to sell this place. Gerry. Come on. -Come on in! -Come in. Come in. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome. Have a good look around, because in a few hours a flat like this could be yours. None of them wanted to see any of the other flats. It really didn't matter. Because they'd seen something they wanted. Something in our brains just clicks, and everything's rose-tinted. So you sold overpriced flats, and the buyers paid for these flats with mortgages from Nicole Kleber. Right? And if someone couldn't pay the mortgage? They were finished. Selling the flat wouldn't have helped because it wasn't worth anything. But banks always get their money somehow. We didn't care. We hadn't forced anyone. All people have one thing in common. They're greedy. All people? Really all of them? Including... Mr. Reinhard? If you remember him. There are exceptions. Is everything okay? Yes. Just one more question. I'm doing all this for my granddaughter. That's good. Yes. My question... Yes, ask away. This isn't a scam, is it? No. You can rest assured. -What's your granddaughter called? -Sarah. You made the right decision when you came here. This is perfect for Sarah. You're an example to us all. Little Sarah will thank you later. Perfect. I felt guilty afterwards. I couldn't even drink my coffee. And I had the runs. How long did the guilty feeling last? Until the six million euros arrived. Surprise! And him? Who is he? -Viktor. -Single? Less talk, more partying. I'm just going to borrow him. Enough foreplay. Come on. -See you soon, darling. -See you soon. We can go, too. I've met someone. Then you can meet someone else. Not today. What's her name? -Nicole. -Nicole? Sounds like a bitch. It won't work. For me, the customer is king. Watch this... Mr. Thiel? Clear your desk. We're moving you. You'll return to your job downstairs. Ms. Kleber, get your things. You'll move into Mr. Thiel's office. As our new department head. And... Look after Mr. Steiner. Ms. Kleber will be at your disposal day and night, Mr. Steiner. Good morning, Ms. Kleber. Good morning, Mr. Steiner. -Do you have a girlfriend? -No. Children I don't know about? No. A better-looking brother? You're sweet. I think I'll give you a try. Just think of all the things you could... It's glorious, isn't it? What do you reckon, Nicki? It's beautiful. You know what's missing? Right here in the middle? A lion's head. In marble. Then you're done. I'll tell you which properties are up for auction, you choose the ones you want, and I'll hold them back. Who'll get the information to us? -Me. -What'll that cost us? Two thousand per flat? Is that too much? Let's say 14,000. There's enough to go around. Agreed? That is so beautiful. -You like it? -Yes. You know what? You can have it. You need to buy the matching earrings. They're lovely. Thanks. Welcome to Victory & Falkland Property, Berlin. Welcome! At Schenkel and Frisch brokerage, we employ fifty-one people, twenty-three of which are insurance brokers. In addition, there is accounts, IT, the data protection officer, management... Ms. Guttmann, how large is your customer base? We represent 45,000 policy holders. That's all we need to know. We'll buy you. Shouldn't we go through the details? -Our lawyers can do all that. -Just one small thing. I'd like to sing a song. Anyone who doesn't join in is fired. Oh, how joyfully Oh, how merrily Christmas comes with its grace divine And now, go for it! Grace again is beaming Christ the world redeeming I can't hear you! Hail, ye Christians Hail, ye Christians Hail the joyous Christmas time! Viktor and Gerry have decided to acquire this firm. Thanks to their vision, this small property firm will become one of the fastest-growing property companies in all of Germany. And you, my friends, are the heart, no, you are the muscles of the firm that will bring their vision to life. You will be the best estate agents in the whole of Germany. What am I saying? In the whole world! Cheers. -Here's to you. -Cheers. Why is she making the speech? You didn't want to and I'm too drunk. Who else could do it? We'll get the bridging loan through a Luxembourg holding company. We'll feed this straight into a new limited company to bridge the gap. You really are a con artist. But don't con us. -What are you talking about? -I just want her to say it. Say it. God! Are you jealous again? Like when Thomas wanted to play with me, not you? -And I already had breasts. -Maybe it's the same now. What's wrong with you? Calm down. I just want her to say it. I won't con you. Okay? -You see? -Right. Why was that so hard? Did you understand everything? All the two of you will have to do is put tax money aside. Sorry about Gerry. He's always been like that. He can't stand women who know more than him. I want this to work. It will. What's wrong? I'm worried it might all fall apart. It won't. I promise. But if you cheat on me, I'll stab you. I did that at 14 when my first boyfriend snogged another girl. You didn't really? You don't do stuff like that. I love you. Here we go. -Bonjour, gentlemen. -Bonjour. Here we are. How much is it? Seriously? -I'll take it. -Very well. I knew you had excellent taste! Go wrap it up. I love his smile. I taught him that as a boy. When he still had crooked teeth. -Your dad's funny! -Yes, that's where I get it from. -Just a quick call. Is that okay, guys? -Of course! We'll just have a drink or two... Sounds good. -I knew it would suit you. -Oh, wow. Coming! Viktor! Viktor! Did he pretend it was from him? Did he? -Where's the letter? -No idea. -Where's the letter? -Hey! In the bin. What's going on? What's going on? -Read it out loud. -No. -Read it! -No. -Read it! -Let go of me! If you don't stop, I'll call the police. You'd have me arrested? Come on, go. Give me the necklace. Goodbye, Viktor. The necklace is a gift from Dad to you. We've been waiting in the restaurant for an hour, and all you can say is that you want to call the police? I don't care if it's from your dad. Isn't this what you've always wanted? Here it is. I didn't leave him because of money. Then why? -It wasn't right anymore. -Right... Now get out. Viki! You thought I had allowed myself to be bought like a whore? So you bought the necklace? You thought if Manfred bought me, you could buy me back? You're like your father. He thought it was all about the money. But it wasn't. Ever. Here's your coffee. WELCOME TO THE COUNTRY INN Shall we have some bubbly? Well, look who's here! That was a long call. The food's gone cold, obviously. Dad. We want to tell you something. Right. -Nicole... -You're going to be a granddad. Do you need a break? Have you spoken to my mum? She wouldn't talk about you. Let's keep going. But you're married, too! -But we met at 16. That's different. -Are you taking the piss? Firstly, she had money before you came along. Secondly, who knows what the future holds? Thirdly, why do you want to get married? Chantal, what do you think? I know my clients, and he doesn't look like a husband. -Said so! -That means nothing. Chantal, what do you think? You'll be unhappy and wind up back here anyway. Just stay here. We need some happy singles. Do you know where Gerry is? -In the Bahamas? -So you don't. -Do you know? -Yes. -Well? -You know the answer. I can't tell you. -Have you told the cops? -No, I haven't. Now at least I know he's alive. WELCOME TO NICOLE AND VIKTOR'S WEDDING I like you, okay? Put my jacket over your head and leave. I'll say you had to puke. There's a car waiting for you. If you want to get out of this, then just say "yes". -I'm staying. -You gave her the necklace. -You'll never get it back. -What have you got against Nicki? I can see people. I saw you. I saw her. But I don't see you together. I like Nicki, really, but... It will all end in misery. That's nonsense. -Did she ask for the necklace? -No. Don't lie to me! Did she ask for it? She's only wearing it today. Why not? It's her wedding day. You should take it home and hide it. Before she does. Gerry, Nicole's really okay. You've been warned. It was the happiest time of my life. I'd never had anything like it. The first year was incredible. We traveled everywhere. After a kung fu film, we flew straight to the Great Wall of China. First class. That's how life should be. And Josefine was always with us. In her first year, the girl had 236 days of sunshine. That will always stay with her. I'm convinced of it. Who do we have here? Hello! Hey. Hello. Are you tired? I knew you'd be a good father. He's passed his trial period, right, Josie? I didn't know I was still on my trial period. Wives always know more. Remember that! Look who's here. -Say hello. -Say hello. Seriously! This guy is insane. Who gave him a driving license? Buy him a pony or a rocking horse, not a Corvette! I need a drink. -How was it, Dad? -Nice. Yeah. Next, I'll try to find reverse. What have you done? -See you in a minute. -Drive carefully. And that's my concept for your company. I studied at Oxford and did my CFA. If I take care of your accounts, they will pass. I spent years in New York and Cape Town. With these qualifications, I'll knock your company into shape. -You're an accountant? -We've got one already. We only employ people who take drugs. Do you take any? Yes, but not before 6 p.m. -Then take a hike. -Yeah. Guys, let me tell you something. If I can take your crappy setup apart in ten minutes, the public prosecutor will be even faster. Give me the job, and I'll make it harder for them. And you might not end up in prison. At least not right now. It's 6 p.m. in Hong Kong. And welcome. Fuck! I said I'd blow you away, but you wouldn't listen. You keep doing the same thing! Jab, jab, jab. -Because you're using R1. -Do it, too. -No, I won't. -Why not? Because you can box normally. -Excuse me. -Not now, we're in a meeting. -Look here. Look here. -Excuse me! -Not now! -It's a letter from the tax office! A letter from the tax office? We all get them. You can pay in installments. Can I get up? Could you come in? Yes. You need water to live, right? You drink it, water plants with it. It makes potatoes, cherries, pears grow. And do you know what the tax office does? Nicole? -Nicole! -Hey, what's going on? Where's the necklace? -Where's the necklace? -Upstairs in the bedroom cupboard. What's wrong? They want millions in tax from us. -So? Just pay it. -But millions! Nicole. What am I going to pay that with? You were supposed to put some money aside. Nicole, don't wind me up! Just tell me where the necklace is. If it's not there, then you must have it. Have you hidden it? I'll buy you a new one. Give me the necklace. Please! I don't have the necklace, okay? Viktor, I don't have the necklace. Where has all the money gone? Buying the company, paying the staff. Four employees at home, 50 at the office. House, cars, necklace... Bang, it was gone. You aren't that stupid. Tell me you aren't that stupid. You blew the lot? Did you? All of it? You never complained when I spent it, Mrs. Smartass. The necklace was my back-up. Find the fucking necklace! I was so screwed. Both of you, you mean? Right? No, Katja is in charge of the money at Gerry's. She saved every cent and transferred his share. What about Gerry? Your friend. Didn't he want to help you? Listen, I can't lend you the money. Katja would kill me. Let's sell the company and disappear. We have to go bigger. We'll take a quantum leap. 25 million in six months. I can put off those wankers for that long. Losing is not an option. Not against the tax office. They destroyed my father. They're not going to destroy me. Don't leave me hanging. Promise me. Yes. What next? Lip gloss? -For you too, Mr. Falkland? -No, thanks. We're done, thanks, Mr. Steiner. -Can we start? -Ready when you are. -Let's do it. -Sound! Rolling. -Camera! -Rolling. -One. One, take one. -And clap. -The fund is nearly at 15 million. -That's good. That's good. That's very, very, very good. Let's pay the tax office, and we're done. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. Look at this. Almost 100 flats. I've paid the deposit. The bank will give us the rest. Build, sell, then a "very warm welcome". Twenty-five million profit. The bloody tax office can have half. You'll never be poor, little one. Our legal department has negotiated a settlement in the class action. -Class action? -I wanted it to be a surprise. The people you sold your first flats to sued us for a total of six million. -Peanuts. -And the settlement? 1,2 million. And they agreed to it. Surprise! -What's up? Why isn't the sand unloaded? -Come on, we need to talk. -Why aren't they working? -Pay them for last month and for the sand. If you don't, they'll take the sand and everything else away. I gave you a card so you could pay them cash. Your card's been blocked. -What? That can't be. -Yes! -It is! So we're on strike! -But you're all off the books! -Since when do cash workers strike? -Since now! -How much sand? -Twenty-four tons. Plus all this shit. -But we need the sand to carry on! -And we all need our money, man! I'm sure we'll find a way. -Yes? -He'll pay! -Calm down. -He'll pay. Calm down, calm down. It's not about the money. We have the money. Mummy's buying a round. Here's to your birthday, Chantal. -We need sand! Lots of sand. By tomorrow. -You're bleeding. We need sand! Man, it's my day off. The tax office has seized the card. The workers are on strike... -How can illegal workers strike? -I don't know. They just do! -So liquidate the fund. -It'll take too long. We need sand now! Or construction will stop. -I've got a better idea. -Good. If you want to see hard workers Come and see the Chantals Stone on stone Stone on stone The cottage will be ready soon I'll never be able to wank anyone off with this hand again. So I'm telling you I want more money than the others. You'll all get the same. No, I'll get more. -Don't tell anyone. -Good boy. This is the last sand pit for tonight. Fantastic job, really. Morning, darling. You're the most beautiful woman in the world. You hide this stuff in her bed, you fucking drug addict? Are you insane? Leave it wherever you want, but not here! What if she'd found it? She's a baby. She can't even find her dummy when it's on her tummy. -Fuck off! -What? Take your stuff and piss off! -Nicole! -Stop! Or I'll call the police, I swear. Stay at Gerry's or wherever. You'll leave me. I can see it in your eyes. You're going to leave. I'll be back. You won't. Take care, Gerry. I'm glad I got to meet you. I've got to work. Morning, darling. Chantal No. 9. Is that a perfume? Yes. Do you want some? That's Gerry's. She's his ex-girlfriend. I skipped three years at school. Did you really think I'd fall for that crap? Call her. Fine. Let's do that. You can't just call! It's none of our business. Hello? Hey, this is Viktor's sister. I found the dollar note with your number. His wife is really jealous and totally crazy. Can he get your number another way? Then I can get rid of this. I know my brother. He'll want to see you again. Sure. Tell him to come by on Friday. He told me a bit about his wife. Something about... She doesn't really fuck him anymore. Why do women have to be so stupid! But hey. He said the pregnancy made her stink so much, he didn't want to go down on her, with me he gets to do that. You're a great sister. Tell him to come by on Friday. Bye. Stay there. Say goodbye. -What are you talking about? -Say goodbye. -Don't come after us. All good, Josie. -Nicole! Hey, Nicole, wait. I'm sorry. It was a mistake. Please stay. Come back. Please. I'll make sure that no bank will ever lend you money again. You fucked up. Loser! What did I do? The company account can only be unblocked once all debts are settled. Otherwise it will remain blocked. -You're letting yourself go, Mr. Steiner. -This is ridiculous. It's not ridiculous. It's serious. I can't continue building. I see the problem. But there's nothing I can do. The house as security? How about that? Your personal mortgage was canceled and your house was used as security. -Who did that? -Ms. Kleber. How can anyone be so stupid and marry so quickly? "I'll make sure that no bank will ever lend you money again." "I'll make sure that no bank will ever lend you money again." Fuck! Shit! -We'll found our own bank! -Viktor, I'll sort things out with Nicki. -I'll take the blame. -She'll come back if we sort it. -You can't just found a bank! -Daniela... You can in Malta. With sufficient personal capital and qualified executives, a banking license costs a trifling 700,000 euros. And we can arrange the five million deposit. -Yes, but we aren't qualified executives. -Mr. Filz and Mrs. Beyer are. They have 45 years of experience. -Where did you get them from? -From our call center. They had to retrain after the crash. So we found our own bank! We lend ourselves money? That doesn't make sense. Right. As a bank, if we have ten cookies, we can lend another 90 cookies without actually owning them. We make money out of nothing? Where do we get the cookies? The cookie monster? Something like that. From the European Central Bank. At an interest rate of 0,7%. Do you get it? The proposal looks good. Unfortunately, your managing directors have insufficient qualifications. They last worked in banking in 2008. Welcome to Malta. Where did you get the money for the license and personal capital? We borrowed it from drug dealers at 15% a week. An overdraft is nothing in comparison. But two weeks later we simply paid it back. Like with the tax office and any unpaid loans. We believe in secure investments, continuity and trust. We will help you build the path to your future. Take the future into your own hands and create your own reality. -Welcome. -You just don't get it, Viktor. Join our newly launched... I've always asked you why you do it. You still don't know. We believe in secure investments, continuity and trust. -Where are you going? -To my wife. Take the future into your own hands... You should go to yours. A warm welcome. Join our newly launched property fund at Victory & Falkland Property, Berlin. I'm Viktor Steiner, and this is Gerry Falkland. We believe in secure investments, continuity and trust. We will help you... POLICE -Going in! -Police! On the floor! Down! Hands behind your back! Why did Nicole Kleber give you up to the authorities? Because I didn't call her after she left. She got a suspended sentence and filed for bankruptcy. -Is she poor? -Yes. But she wanted to get Josefine away from you. Can I have a cigarette? -I'm sorry. -Don't worry about it, Viktor. I knew what was going on. My son cracked the system that turns us all into slaves. Viktor, listen. Whatever happens, you are and always will be my son. I'll get you a lawyer. -Then I'll come to see you. -Okay, Dad. Steiner. No visitors for you. Impossible. My father should be here. Could you check the list for Peter Steiner? If he was coming, he'd be here already. But he isn't. PRISON OFFICER Steiner. Come with me. Hello, Mom. Your father called me. He told me you're in prison. He was driving. He called me from the car. Viktor! PRISON OFFICER Have you ever wondered why I wanted you to do the interview? You wanted to profit from it, like all criminals? That's not why. You have children, too, right? Yes. I'm going to ask something of you and you'll understand. I work in the workshop for 120 euros a month. I pay a subscription for my daughter. Nicole gives her the magazine every week. The magazine comes with a DVD with the cartoon of the week. But Nicole hasn't told her it's from me. Her solicitor told me. She's been getting the magazine for years. This month, you will take it to her. I need your help. Please. Josie! Your magazine's here. -Thank you. -Do I get a kiss? But finish your homework before you watch the cartoon. I've done it. Hello, Josefine. I'm your dad. I want you to know I love you more than anything, my darling. I've made many mistakes. The only thing I got right was to bring you into the world. But I ruined it. I know that now. I'd like you to forgive me, my sweetheart. I miss your smile. PRISON OFFICER -Steiner? -Yes. Take care, Viktor. Look after yourself. GATE ONE PRISON Hello. I never mentioned you. She never missed having a father. Suddenly she said she dreamed of you. That you'd apologized and told her you loved her. She only talks about you. I have my life under control. I don't want any stress. Don't break her heart, or else... Is she here? Come on, Josie. Hey, little princess. A very warm welcome. Hello. This is us. Bye-bye, my love. When will I see you? -I'll think about it. -Tomorrow? Saturday. Come on. FOR VIKTOR Gerry here. I won't beat around the bush. I hope you're a lion at last. You always did have the heart of a lion. Love from paradise. Gerry. Hi. Excuse me, do you know where number 20 is? It's across the street. -Are you going to the auction? -Yes. I thought I'd try my luck. I'm on my way there, too. Subtitle translation by Lena Karsten
