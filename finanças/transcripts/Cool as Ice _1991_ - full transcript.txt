Out of here. Hey, wait up. Hi. Aww! Let's go. Come on, man. We got to break. Let's go! Come on, man. We gotta get on the road all night. Aww! Out of here. Let's go. Hey, yo, Jack. Come here, man. Come here. Yo, yo, peep it out. Over there, man. Check. Hey, you okay? - Damn! What the hell's wrong with you? - What the hell's wrong with you? - Nothin' 'til now. - Aww, what? I hurt you? That's all right. I'll live. Yeah, you hit pretty good for a girl. Yeah? Comin' from a big macho biker like yourself, I'll take that as a compliment. Yep, yep, she likes me. Hey, yo, fellas, where we at, man? In the middle... Damn! - What's up? - This bike is trippin''. - Again? - What else is new? I don't know why it's trippin' like this. - Yo, maybe you got too much weight on it. - Damn, man. Damn! Bike's trippin' again. - Not again. - Again! - Your big butt ain't gettin' on my bike. - You ain't gettin' on my bike either. That Jheri curl is drippin' from the back of your neck. Oh, yeah, that is real funny, man. It's drippin' all the way down here to the motor. Too bad, so sad. You don't know what you're doin'. Move it! Yo, man, check out this crazy wacked house. Hey! Hey! Hey, you! Wait! Hey, you're late! - Say what? - You're late! What happened to you? You said you'd be here an hour ago. And you call this thing prime? My god, I wouldn't even give you 500 for it. I don't want nothin'. Oh, I get it. I get it. A negotiator, huh? Oh, Mae! Mae! - Mae! - I'm comin', I'm comin"! Come on, Mae. Haggle with them, damn it. I got 'em down to six, but... Get real, Roscoe. This bike is worth more than our house. Well... Look if, uhm... if you do ever want somebody to work on it, why don't you give us a call. We're the best around. - You can fix these? - Can we fix 'em? My god, when we get through with those wheels, you won't know they're yours. Not mine, man. His. - Yo, dude! - Oh, no. No way, man. He ain't touchin' this bike. Make yourselves at home. We'll have it fixed in a jiffy. - What does it say? - It says, "before and after." - 52, page 52. - Page 52. What's that? 55. Mmm. - Okay... - Piston. All right. Wait a minute. - Put the piston in. - Hold on a minute, Mae. - Put the piston in. - You're pressuring me, Mae, again. Oh, yeah. - It's not that far away, Nick. - It is. - No, it isn't. - It is. It's a lot farther than here. Come on, Kathy, we both know what's gonna happen. Couples always break up when they go away to different colleges. - If that's what you want... - I didn't say that. I'm sure there's a couple girls that'll be glad to hear it. Oh, I'm sure there are. All right, I'll think about it. - Hey, I love you. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - What the hell is that? - Don't ask me. So what's up? - How ya doin'? - Fine. - And the horse? - Since when do you care? - Wait a minute! You two know each other? - No. - Oh, yeah. - Which is it, Kathy? Kathy. Mmm-hmm... Kat. Come on, we're wasting his time. Oh, no, you're not wasting my time. I'm just coolin''. Then, you're wasting our time. All right, I get it. Check this though. - If you need me, I'll be right over there. - She won't. Yeah, we'll see about that. Oh, yeah. Kat, words of wisdom. Drop that zero and get with the hero. Excuse me? See you later, dick. It's Nick. Oh, yeah, yeah. Nick. - What was that all about? - Forget him. I already have. Where you been? Chillin' with Kat. You know, the chick who drives the horse. Oh, now you got her name? No, check this out, I got me more than that, G. Little black book. Oh, that's great. That's very great. Looky, looky, looky in Kat's black booky. - Yo, she's on! - Come on, everybody, let's sit down. Come on, guys. Gordon, sit by me. Kathy, sit by me. ...a very inspirational and special achiever. Thanks, Chuck. Well, you talk about achievers. Have I got one for you. Her name's Kathryn Winslow. - And you'll probably read... - Yeah! Already her record is remarkable. A high school senior with a 4.0 grade average. Double 800's on her scholastic achievement test. What is the answer? In that case... What is the question? Recently we talked to Kathy... - Yo, she's on! - Yo, yo, man. Chill, chill, chill. Well, you know, I've been reading a lot of articles that say, uhm... It's perfectly normal for adolescents to hate their parents. But... I don't and... That's 'cause they don't hate your ass. Oh, no. Did I say that? I grew up believing people can be whatever they want to be as long as they're willing to work. And... That's all I've been doing, with a little help. - From who? - My Dad. - And what does he think about all of this? - I don't know. Ask him. Mr. Winslow... - Hey, hey, hey, turn this up. - Yeah, in a minute. Now! ...very proud. But I can't begin to take credit for everything Kathryn has become. We, uh... Her mother and I have tried to set an example... sure. - But Kathryn's always been very... - I can't believe it's him. Buddy of yours? Most of the time we just watch her with amazement. She's great. Mr. Winslow, what are your expectations for Kathryn as she enters college? That's enough out of me. She's the star of the show. Thanks, Dad. She sure is and we're proud of her. I'm Deborah Norris and that's the news for tonight. I wanted it over. You were great. - You were so great. - Oh, come on. All I did was talk. I just following Dad's... You are not gonna believe who I just saw on TV. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah. Dad... You know, on TV you don't look like a geek at all. Tommy! Thank you, Tommy. That's quite a relief. - Hello? - We're so proud of you. Hello? I thought you looked great. I liked it. You liked it? Really? Hello? Hello... Charlie. Right. Right. She is even prettier in real life. By the way, Charlie... did you just call? No. Uh-huh. Oh, no... Okay. All right. Thanks again. Why? Did you sell it? No, I wanna buy it... for me, Silly. Dad, what's the matter? Uhm... Charlie Turner wants to know why Tracy can't be more like you. Oh, really? That's interesting because Tracy thinks I should be more like her. - No. - Yes. Her old man doesn't. Your old man's ready to eat, how 'bout it? Nick, are you gonna have dinner with us tonight? Oh, I promised my parents. I can't. - Some other time. - Thanks anyway. Yeah, definitely. So... - What about my ride? - Next time, Tommy. - Promise! - But you always promise. What a dick. So, Sugar Shack tonight? For a change? - Smile when you say that? - I did. Okay. So I'll pick you up tonight about 8 o'clock? - Mmm-hmm. Okay. - Okay. Bye. - Bye, Mr. and Mrs. Winslow. - Bye, Nick. - My organizer's gone. - Don't look at me. Tommy, this is serious. It's got all my scholarship stuff in it. So trace back what you did today and figure out where you left it. Okay. Okay, well, I know I had it when I went to work. Because when I left work, I put my check in it. And then I went straight to Nick's house and I didn't touch it at Nick's house... - Ha, ha. - Shut up. And then, nothing happened in between there because he drove me straight home. I take that back. I know exactly where it is. And I know exactly how to get it back. Is she gonna hook you up with those lessons, D? Sure. What the hell are they doin' out there? That's it, man. I'm goin' out there. Roscoe, I can't believe it. Yo, hi! Where's my bike? - He really is a genius. - Where's my bike? - So, how long all you guys stayin'? - Yo, where's my bike? Stayin'? You know you're welcome to stay as long as you want. Where's my bike at? What's the matter with you? It's right here. Right before your eyes. Don't you see it? That's his bike? Onh. You all think this is funny? Isn't it marvelous? It's in a million pieces. Yeah, like I always say... You can't put anything together until you take it apart. Huh? Yo, man, that's a great philosophy, but like... Can you put it back together with quickness? That's exactly what I intend to do. - When will that be? - Well, now, I don't know. - Maybe tomorrow. - Tomorrow? Morrisey, found it. Found it? You know the name of this place? Yep, I'm sure of it. Can't wait to get there, man. I'm starving. Gonna get me some hot wings. Gonna get me some french fries. You got a landfill there? All you ever do is think about is eating. Soft drinks, yeah. Gonna get me a lot of hamburgers. Say, you ever think that this would happen? No, and now that it has I want to make sure we get it done right. Okay? Let's go, cowboy. Come on. Come on. - Let's make it blast. Yeah! - Come on, let's go. We're all very impressed, dear. Now let's call it a day. Maybe he found out which part. Who him? No! That's my job. How do you think we get anything fixed around here anyway? Roscoe! Give it a rest. - Yo, I'm out of here. - Where you going? Across the street to "shling a shlong." What? Hey, yo! What's up, ma'am. - Can I help you? - Wow! - Yeah, I'm looking for Kat. - We don't have a cat. Kathy, your daughter. - You wanna see her? - Tommy, go inside. - Whoa. - What's up, slick? I'm sorry, but Kathy's not here right now. - I don't suppose you know where she is? - I'm sorry, I don't. - I do. The Sugar Shack. - Tommy. It's a club. She's with Nick, her boyfriend. Sugar Shack, huh? I might have to check that out. - Do you know where it is? - Tommy? - If you don't, I can show you. - Tommy, go inside. Okay. See you around. All right, partner. It was very pleasant meeting you, ma'am. Hey, yo. Yo, yourself. - You guys know where the Sugar Shack is? - Sugar Shack? - Why? - 'Cause I wanna know. - Who was that, sweetheart? - Oh, some boy looking for Kathy. - Who? - I don't know. Didn't ask. See that street down there? Way way down there? Go all the way down that big long street. You'll pass by a big place looks like a church. Leave the kid alone. Listen, he's only kidding. You gotta get back this way about 4 or 5 blocks. You make a right hand turn, you go over the bridge. Just kitty-corner from there you'll find the Sugar Shack. Exactly. - Schmucks. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. - Take a ride, huh? - He's kinda cute, isn't he? Oh, yeah, beautiful. You want some? Come on, let's go. I gotta finish this. You know you're a slob for Christ's sakes? I love you, too. We'll come back and pay our friend a visit after dark. They'll probably give you your own soap opera. You look great, Kathryn. - Well, ain't this fun? - Why don't you try dancin'? - Why don't you try dancin'? - I got something else to do. I'm gonna go over and be with them turntables. - Jazz, hold up, man. I'm with you. - Bye. Yeah, it was a trick to get Nick. So, we having fun yet or what? - Yeah. - Yeah? How about a drink? - I'll have a Diet Coke. - Diet Coke! Kathy, be serious. Nick, you be serious. You're driving. Kathy, I'm a big boy. I'm also a thirsty one. I like that band. They're sharp, huh? Going to town. Kathy, you wanna dance? You wanna dance or are you gonna do homework in your head all night? No, I'm finished. Sorry. Jimmy. Hey, young officer Jim. Long time no see. About 20 years, but you look great. - Ha-ha-ha. - Doesn't he look great? I'm afraid you gentlemen have made some mistake. My name is Gordon Winslow. Gordon? - If you'll excuse me. - Hey, Jim. The cameras really don't do you much justice at all. No, but they sure do make your daughter look good. - Gordon? - Sarah Louise, is that you? - She looks great. Doesn't she look great? - Yeah. - She looks great. - Okay. - Okay what, Jim? - Okay, what do you want? What we want, Jim, is a little collection on an old IOU. About 500,000 to be exact. James, Jim, Jimmy, Jimbo. Hey, you got yours. Now we want ours. What time is it? Your watch... what time is it? Because you know what? You've got until this time tomorrow to get it, Jim. Hey, dig this. Sly. Hey, man, I got an idea. Come on, dude, let's do it. Yep, yep. Oh my god. Drop it. - I'm gonna drop some funky lyrics. - What's going on? It goes a little bit something... like this. Let's get outta here. Yo, you're not bad. Yo, neither are you. - What? - I was just thinking. - Mm-hmm, about? - About you... And my organizer. - Organizer? - You have 24 hours to return it to me. The way you found it. Oh, excuse me, the way you stole it... Or I'm gonna call the cops. Mm-hmm, if that's all you wanted, why'd you dance with me? To show you I could. What are you doing? You've embarrassed yourself enough for one night. I hope you're happy. You just made a complete fool of me in front of our friends. If I did, I'm sorry. It wasn't my intention. Oh, what was your intention? You know, I don't get it. First, you didn't want to go out. And then you start acting like some slut... I'm talking to you! You act like some slut with this whatever his name is... And of course, you don't drink, so that's no excuse either, is it? I'm willing to forgive you for this. Hey, I said I'm willing to forgive you for this. Okay? It's forgotten. Okay? Nick, don't. Don't. I said, don't! That's all you say lately is "don't". Yeah, well, maybe that means something. Yeah, maybe you're saving it for some frat guy... Or your little freak friend inside. You know something, Nick? You really are a dick. Get in the car, Kathy. I said, get in the car, Kathy. Hey! I'm talking to you! Come on, get on! Hurry up, get on! Hey! Hey! What was that? Yo, who the hell was that back there? I don't know. Just some jerks. I'll say. Uhm, I better be going. So soon? So what's up with tomorrow? I don't know, man. So what's up with tomorrow? - What are we doing? - I'm waiting. - For me? - For my organizer. Good night. JOhJ Dissed again. - Hi? - Hi, hi. Who was that? It was this guy who gave me a ride home. Who is he? What's his name? - I don't know. - You don't know? No. What? What's going on? Nothing, Kathryn, nothing at all. In the future, I wouldn't recommend taking rides from strangers. Well, Dad, if you would let me explain... No explanation necessary, please, please. Just don't do it again. Okay. Thank you. Good night, honey. Good night. - Good night. - Good night. Don't... don't worry, Kathy. Everything's fine. All right! Watch this! Yeah! Ha-ha! So what's up, fellas? Look who's here! Little batting practice on your bike. Not mine. Sir D's. - Who's Sir D? - My homeboy. Yeah? Well, homeboy this. You freaking... Oow! See ya, dick. Call the Marshall. I did. Grace, there's only so much he can do. Shhh! We don't want to wake up Mom and Dad. What are you doing here? - You asked me. - Oh, really. You don't remember? "Just like I found it." "Excuse me, like I stole it." So, um, who's Monique? - Who? - What? You don't know? You have her phone number. I mean, this is you, isn't it? John van Owen. Where'd you get...? Give me that. - Where'd you get that? - Took it out of your pocket. - Give me that. - So. Does she live around here? Should we give her a call? Oh, no, no, wait. Don't tell me. She's your sister, right? Dissing me about the book and now you take my stuff? How else could I make sure I got my stuff back? - There, we're even. - Yeah, we'll see. Well. Well. I'll see you later. You're seeing me now. Oh, I'm seeing you now. Look, you can't stay in here. I have to change. - Go ahead. - What? You think I won't? - Kathy, Mom says. - Tommy, get out of here. Whoa, you're back. - What's up, slick? - Are you her new boyfriend? - Tommy, get outta here. - Is that your bike out front? - Tommy! - Yeah, you ever been on one? - You wiill. - Yeah! When? Soon, kid, soon. As soon as you're done making sex? Tommy, get out of here. That's not funny. - Promise? - Promise. Yo, Kat, if you need me, I'll be outside. Goddamn! Come on. Yes. Yeah. Right here. So, how long have you lived here? - Go ahead. - No, no, no, you go. Alright, so how long have you lived here? Um, all my life. Why? - What's it like? - What do you mean, "what's it like?" You know, having parents and all that stuff? Brother... all that stuff, you know? It's nice. You can always depend on them. I guess. - So, what'd you wanna ask me? - Never mind. - Really! What did you wanna ask me? - Never mind. Doesn't matter. - So where are you from? - Around. - Around? - Yep, yep. Well, that doesn't tell me very much. Doesn't it? No. It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at anyway. And right now I'm here with you... Kat. - So tell me. - What? What do you do for fun around here... College qirl? - What? You too busy for that? - No. I don't think there's anything wrong with working hard. Imagine that. So... what's important to you? If you ain't true to yourself, then you ain't true to nobody. Live your life for someone else... You ain't livin'. Straight up fact. - Imagine that. - Imagine that. Sometimes I'd like to do something really wild... just because I never have. Why don't you? Mmm! What's up, slick? After you. Well, thanks. For what? Everything. What's this for? Oh, it's just so you know the difference between me and Monique. I know the difference between you and anybody. - Oh, yeah? - Oh, yeah. - Kathryn. - Dad. We haven't heard from you all day. Your mother's frantic. I'm sorry. I didn't know. You didn't think! The least you could've done was call. She couldn't, she was out with me. No telephones around. Where were you? She was on the back of the bike. We were just cruising around. Yeah, I know. I've met his two friends. - What? - Who? Don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about. I saw you with them last night. Get outta here. Get out and leave my daughter alone. But Dad, you don't understand! No, young lady, you don't understand. Nick wound up in the hospital last night. It seems your friend put him there. Did you do that? Yeah, wack-head tried to play baseball with my homeboy's bike. Get inside. I'll handle this. - But, Dad? - Inside! Now. I'll see you tomorrow, Kat. I don't want you near her tomorrow... Or any other day. Isn't that up to her? Get the hell outta here. She has to know what's going on. We have to tell her. - What? What? Tell her what? - The truth. - Yo, homie, how am I doin'? - Slam. There's something I should've told you a long time ago. My real name. The one I was born with isn't Gordon Winslow. It's Hackett. James Anthony Hackett. Jimmy. Your Mom's name was Sarah. We'd just been married. I was a policeman. Practically a rookie. My partner, a guy named Walsh, thought I was pretty square. I guess I was. But I was also honest. And Walsh wasn't. So, when internal affairs decided to do something about it, I did what I thought was right. Two other cops were convicted with Walsh. They, uh... They made some threats. Your mother was pregnant. So, when the justice department offered us a place in the witness protection program, I said "yes." Within a week, we were Gordon and Grace Winslow. Birth certificates, college diplomas. Suddenly I'm selling insurance. We came here. You were born a little while later. And that was the end of Jimmy and Sarah Hackett. Until now. Last night, I... saw your friend with two men. The other cops. They saw me on TV. What are they gonna do? They say we owe them money. That I've kept it from them all these years. - What's gonna happen? - For now, all we can do is be careful. Especially with strangers. These are wrong guys, Kathy. These are men to stay away from. He's not what you think he is. How do you know? I just do. If you knew him, you'd know that too. See, that's my point, Kathy. I don't know him and neither do you. Oh, I know you, Dad. But does that mean I should trust you? Haven't you lied to me my whole life? Not lying. Protecting. Everything I did, good or bad, right or wrong, I did for you. Can you say the same about him? Oh, that's not fair. And you know it. I love you, Kathryn. I love you so much. I gave up my old life to give you a new one. Dad? About Johnny, are you sure? I want you to stay away from him. Not just for your sake. But for your mother's, your brother's and mine. Hey, yo! What's up? I was just chilling in the hood and I thought you might wanna go for a ride. No, I already have a ride. Thanks. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - All right, then. I'll see you tonight. - No! - No? - No. No, not tonight, not tomorrow, not anymore, okay? I get it. You too busy doing what needs to be done, huh? Yeah, well, maybe I am! And maybe I have a good reason to do it. I bet someone put you up to that reason, too, huh? Tell me one thing. Who you being true to now? You know, sometimes I think I know you. But then how can you know somebody that you just met, right? I mean, you make me feel special, but how do I know that you don't make everybody feel special? How do I know that this isn't just another town and I'm not just another Monique? Is this you or your old man talking? Me. I don't know. You know something? You don't know. You don't know me. You don't know me at all! Well, you really done it this time. I honestly don't know if Nick'll take you back. The least you could've done was go see him in the hospital. Or call! I mean, who do you think you are, anyway? Well, I still don't think it's too late. I mean, not if she's cool about it. Are you kidding? You think he'd forgive her after humiliating him like that? No way! Just tell him how sorry you are. And how much you love him. Johnny? Johnny! What do you think? It's fresh, man. Thanks. I did it myself. Yeah, I can tell. - So what's up, man? - You mean Kathy? Something like that. Whenever I talk about you, she tells me to shut up. In my school, that always means the girl likes you. Oh yeah? She thinks I'm at little league right now, but I ditched it to come here. I thought maybe we could go for a ride. You promised. Remember? Yeah, but not right now, kid. I'm kinda busy, you know what I'm sayin'? Let's go! - Yes! Ha-ha, all right! - 000-000-000-000-000-000-000! - Flare it out, flare it out! - I gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. - Stretch it out, okay? - Okay. - Help me, Mae, just a little. - I don't want you to pinch... ow! - Ow! - You hurt my finger! - It's fine, Mae. - Roscoe, listen to me! That piece is not gonna fit there. It's fitting, Mae. It's fitting. Thanks, Johnny. That was the coolest. - Wanna see my room? - I don't know. It's okay. Kathy went to pick me up at little league. - Oh, yeah? Where you're supposed to be? - I don't care. It's her fault I have to sheak over to see ya. That's alright. She's just out doin' what Daddy says. Yeah, well... see ya. Hey, yo, Tommy, I'm outta here. For good? Just like yesterday. Later, homie. Down! Put-put-put-put-put-put-put-put-put! Kathy? So, what have we... Look who we got here. What are you doing here? W-W-What do you want? Why aren't you at little league, huh? What are you doing here, boy? - Huh? - We're friends of your father's, son. We've just come by from work to pick up some important papers. That's right... papers. I don't know you. I'm calling the cops. - You don't wanna do that, son. - Dial 9-1-1. 9...11. Stay back! They keep a record of these calls. I saw it on "America's Most Wanted." Yeah? Well, did you see the one that I was on? -9.. - Put the phone down! Help! - Hey! Come here! - Come here! Come here, boy! I'm gonna get you! - Stay away! - Ow! - Get away from me. - I'm gonna get you! Hey! Hey, hey. You're mine, kid. - Where did you think you were going, pal? - Gotchal - Where you going? Come on, let's go. - Shut up! - Help! Help! - Help! Help! - Help! - Help! Why don't you shut up? Moron. Tommy? I don't think he heard right. We going, man? For good? I got ears. Let's break! Oh, he's buggin'. He's buggin'. Man, you really are hooked. Mm-hmm. - Are we leavin' or not? - Not 'til you go say good-bye. You really got me bent. No way. Never. Be true, man! You think we want you wondering what would've happened if you did? Ah, ah, man, you're too far gone already! Mm-hmm. Kathryn? - Kathy, what are you doing? - Nothing. Thinking. Where's Tommy? I thought he was with you. Kathy, you know I asked you to pick him up at little league. I did. He wasn't there. I figured he was with you. - Kathy, did you check up in his room? - No, but... He's not here. - Oh, my god. - What? I thought I told you to stay away from here. Yo, I gotta talk to Kat. She's not here. She's right behind you. So, you wanna talk or what? I get it. You're still doing what Daddy says, huh? Here, this is for you. What is that? It's a tape. Hi, Mom, Dad, Kathy. I am making this tape to tell you what a very good time I'm having with my new friends. They have told me a lot about you, Dad. And I do not think you have treated them fair. So... I will stay here 'til you do. If you change your mind in the next 24 hours... I will come home. If you don't... I won't. So, do what you have to do and everything will be okay. I told you. I told you he was a part of this. Daddy, he didn't have anything to do with this. Jesus, Kathy! You really think he came to see you? He was here to deliver this. I'm calling the police. No, don't! Look, that kid's stayin' down the block. They must know something there. Hey, Mr. Winslow. How you doin'? What? What did I say? Something's happened to Tommy. Tommy, where? I just saw Tommy. - Where? - Yeah, they were headed downtown. - Where downtown? - Um, by the mall. What's that street? Grove Street. - They were headed west on Grove. - Who? Tommy and the guy who jumped me at the Sugar Shack. I knew something was wrong. He looked really scared. No, you're wrong. You're all wrong. You're wrong. - I know he had nothing to do with it. - How can you know that, Kathryn? I trust him, Dad. What's that supposed to mean? This has gone far enough. I'm calling the police. Dad. We should be careful. ...they're gonna do something. Grace, I've had enough of this. This is Gordon Winslow... You trust him. That's just great. This is an emergency. Yes. Please. No! - Kathy? - What are you doing? Get back here! Kathy! Johnny, I need to talk to you. I need to talk to you. You need a psychiatrist. Please listen to this. Please! Please. What's up with this? Johnny, my brother's been kidnapped. So, I will stay here 'til you do. If you change your mind in the next 24 hours I will come home. If you don't... I won't. So, do what you have to do. And everything will be okay. I won't. Come on, what do we do? We got to hurry up. ...and everything will be o... I won't. That sound. I know that sound. What sound? Where do you hear a sound? - If you don't... - You hear it? I won't. - So, do what you have to do. - That thumping sound. If you don't... I won't. You took me there. We were, um... - The construction site. - Yes! Say, where is this? It's gone. Where was it? Is it still here somewhere? I don't know. It could be anywhere. Hey, knucklehead, look at this. Look what we got here. The martians have landed. - Oh yeah. Cute martians too, huh? - Yeah. - Look at them cute little bikes. - Look at the zigzag haircut. - Get that thing outta my eyes, will ya? - You are ours! Just because we can't hear it, doesn't mean they're not here. Just forget it. Let's go. Let's just go. What's the lead martian like? Is he your lead martian? Is he your leader? You're not even close, fancy pants. You are ours! Going... going... And they are... gone! Hey, kid! You know something, if your old man doesn't come through, you're gonna wind up on a milk carton. You know what that means? That means that my friend over here, the pretty one... When he doesn't get what he wants, he gets real angry. - Roar! Oh, I get real angry! - Shut up, you... Morrisey, when this whole thing is said and done, you know what I do? I wanna get myself a joint just like this. Yeah, it'd be nice, huh? - What was that? - What? - That! - What? The fat's gone to your head. I don't hear anything. Tommy? - Ow! - Come on, let's go. Yo, suckers! I just wish he would come home. I told you, Officer, my grandson is gone. Any idea where? Back to Harvard. Where else? Oh, that's right. He's got a big chem final tomorrow. That's his major, chemistry. And with a minor in... Modern dance. Well, if he happens to call from his dorm room... What the hell? Hey, guys, how you doin'? Tommy! Tommy, Tommy! Tommy! - Are you all right? - Mom, chill. Thanks for the ride. - Yo! - Yo-ho. Everybody's watchin'. Oh, my god. Did they do this to your hair? Hell, no. I did it myself! - You okay? - Mm-hmm. This is bad, ain't it? Bad... - Be right back. - Okay. Mom, I'm fine! Relax! Thanks. Doesn't really matter. We'll... we'll see you later. - Not too late. - Okay. You know I'm outta here. Oh, I thought we were outta here. So what are you gonna do... College girl? Well, I don't know. You know, college doesn't start tonight... smart ass. Then let's g-o. Kathy? You know what you're doing? I hope not. I hope you like being a biker-chick 'cause you're not gonna see me or my car again. Imagine that. - Hold on. - Where are we going? I forgot somethin'. Check this. Drop it. D-d-d-d-d-d-drop it. Drop it, drop it. Put your weight on this. Ah, yeah. So you like it like that, huh? Yeah, I thought you would. So I'm just gonna let this beat ride for ya. And I'm o-u-t... out. Yep, yep. Forget that peace stuff. 'Cause I ain't wit' it. In the house and the house is packed.
