Hello? 'Morning. What is this? How ya feeling? Whoa, whoa, easy. Might want to give it a bit before going for a stroll. What happened? You don't remember? I was shot. In the back. Really? Some kind of neutralizer. Oh, gotcha. I thought you meant, you know, like shot, shot. Is this... What's your name? Frank. Frank. Yeah. I am your LSO. What does that mean? You can call me Howard. No, what is LSO? What does... Hello? Hello!!? Yes, yep, sorry, just getting set up here. What am I doing here? Is that rhetorical? No, what is this place? That was covered in admissions and staging. Ha, I don't even know how I got here. I didn't...no one's told me anything. I'm only here to acclimate you to ISN Habitat and Service. I've been arrested... This is a... I've been detained, by the ISN? I don't have that information. But I haven't done anything wrong. What am I being charged with? You're not being charged with anything, you're being processed. Processed. Listen. I don't know what you think I've done, or who you think I am, but it's a mistake. I don't have a record. I've never been arrested before. I have nothing to do with the ISN. I am a civilian. So, can you check? I don't have access. What does that mean? That's not how this program works. How does it work? Do I get a phone call? I don't think so. How about a lawyer? I'm not sure. What do you know? I know my job. And what would that be? I'm here to keep you alive, Frank. Shall we get started? I've got three different flavors, orange citrus, tropical berry and ah, well, regular water... Oh, coffee too, make that four flavors. Want one? No. Do you want something to eat? No, I'm not... Want to hear some music? Music, seriously? Yeah, I've got a small library, assorted genres, classical, jazz, new age. No. Do you want to... No. ...go for a walk? A walk? Yeah, stretch the legs. Yeah, sure, okay. How long you planning on keeping me here? Until you're processed. When is that gonna start? I don't have that information. Ah, can I talk to your supervisor? Please? I don't have a supervisor. How can that be? It's a server-based program, operating off the GSL protocol. A computer is your supervisor. Well, no... Listen, there is... ...I guess you could say that, but- There has to be someone who knows someone who knows something about why I'm here. Could you, could you talk to them, please? What's your last name? Lerner, Lerner. Frank Lerner. So, are you gonna check? On what? On why I'm here. I don't have access. Listen. You can't keep me here without telling me why, right? I have rights. At least the right to know why I was brought here. That was covered in the video. I didn't see the god damn video. I was shot. I was asleep. I was knocked out! This has been an error and you can't even check? I don't have access. Of course not, of course not! ...demanding the release of Fletcher May, leader of the Alliance, whose mysterious disappearance has sparked outrage among LFO sympathizers. Charges of illegal detainment and military strong-armed tactics have only fueled the volatile situation between the ISN security units and civil rights activists. The White House Press Secretary, Edward Baeza has denied any involvement or knowledge of May's disappearance as administrative officials seek a cease fire between armed militants and the GR police force security units. No one even knows. About what? What happened to me. Friends, family. I just vanished. So, where are ya from? I'm from the south side. Really? Is that where you grew up? Where are you from? Or do you not have that information? I'm from Austin. Texas. You don't sound like you're from Texas. Born there, but I grew up in a small town outside of Seattle, a place not many people have heard of. Really? That's fascinating. Why would a small town boy like you, ah, join up with the ISN? It's a job, I guess. It's a job. Doing this to people. You know there used to be laws against this. Civil rights, Miranda. Due process? Constitution? Any of this ring a bell? That's not my department. You, you're just a button pusher. I mean even with automated protocol that doesn't really fly anymore, Howard, does it? I mean take a little accountability for what you're a part of. You're the one keeping me here. This is your department. It's not just serving drinks, taking song requests, is it? What do you do for a job? Christ. You're something else, I'll give you that. You're a piece of work. You said there was something to eat? Yeah, yeah okay. I've got three different flavors. Chicken, beef and vegetable. What do ya wanna try? Whatever. How long have I been in here? Umm, I don't know. You were asleep when I signed on. I need you to check the files or whatever to see if someone went to my apartment. What's in your apartment? Look, after my arrest I just need to know if someone went there. Why's that? I have a dog. You have a dog? I know it may seem silly but no one knows he's there, so... What kind of dog? He's, he's locked inside, do you understand? So he could bark all day and no one would care. He will die if no one shows up. That's horrible. No shit! Could you make a phone call, could you check, could you contact someone, please? I can't do that. You can't make a phone call? You can't send a text? Just to see if someone went there. Just to make sure he's taken care of. I don't need to know. Please, please. Please? That's not how the program works. Ah, Jesus, God...the program! Son of a bitch! I need water. Can I... have some water please, Howard? Yeah, of course. Want to try one of the flavors? Just water please. What happened over here? Where am I supposed to go? You didn't give me a bucket. Next time just ask to use the bathroom. The bathroom? What the...who did this? Did you come in here? Just a little room service. Yeah... but how? You done with the bathroom, Frank? What can I get ya? Hey, ah coffee? What flavor? Just regular coffee. Boosts, room for meds? No. Alright, you're easy. Jesus! Want to try a different flavor? Which one's this? Vegetable. May not seem like much, but it does have everything you need. Vitamins and minerals. Have you tasted it? I don't have that information. Wait a sec, what does that mean? Which part? Howard? Yes, Frank. Howard. Yes, Frank. Howard. Yes, Frank. Howard. Yes, Frank. Howard. Yes, Frank. Howard. Yes, Frank. Howard! Yes, Frank. You gotta be kidding me. About what? How did I not see that? See what? I'm talking to a computer. I'm talking to a computer... Get me out of here! Frank, please I can answer any questions. Help me, answer questions? You haven't answered one. You don't know anything. You don't have that information. You get a real person on the line or down here because I am done debating with you, Howard. I am done! I'm not debating. Hey, hey, you hear me? I am done... Done! I'm not going to do circles with a fucking Speak and Spell. I'm not sure that's the brand. Oh, God yeah, and one with a humor response program. Thank you, thank you, Lord. A little weak on the disposition there, Howard, but the assorted inflections are impressive. I mean almost palpable. Real impressive. Thanks. That's sarcasm, Howard, that's sarcasm. Obviously not one of your faster applications. Oh my, God. God... Rrrrrrrrrgh! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You said you were from Austin. You grew up outside Seattle. What is that bullshit? I was built at HRS in Austin. I was programmed at Tech-Tronics outside of Seattle. Oh, that's, that's cute, real cute. What are you, IR7, maybe IR8? Twelve. I take it back. Quite a piece of machinery. I should feel honored to have such an expensive piece of gear making me dinner, watching me take a crap. Sarcasm? And it learns. AI5? Six. You seem to know a lot about computers. Enough. Personally, I despise them. Why's that? Take a wild guess. Well I'd imagine it'd have something to do... Actually, don't guess. I can do without it. Some things, Howard, are not meant to be computerized. What does that mean? Larry? Huh? Larry. I don't understand. You've been in before. Ah, no. I've never, my name's not Larry. Thank you. You're welcome, Pete. No, no, don't, don't tell me. Dave. Do you like it? The photo. Yes I do and no, not Dave. I took it. Really? Couldn't make a living out of it, but that's my thing. They're beautiful. Thanks. Give me your hand. C'mon, c'mon, give me, give me your hand. Frank. How'd you know that? It's another one of my things. Can't make a living out of that either, so I make coffee. Wasn't my first guess. I'm not one that's easily impressed... Gabby. But I'm impressed. Do you like it? The photo. Yeah, I do. I took it. Couldn't make a living out of it but, that's my thing. It's beautiful. Thanks. Ah, maybe I should have made you an espresso. Oh, ahh, no. Fine. Thanks. Sorry, thanks. You're welcome. Give me your hand, c'mon, c'mon. Frank. No, just, just stop, just stop, stop it, stop it! Frank. What happened? Aww, it felt like, ummm, day dreams, it just, little pieces of memory over and over and over and over, and it just kept coming. I think it was, umm... How can you not know what that thing is, Howard? What do you think it is? I assumed, ventilation? Ventilation. Do you expect me to buy this good bot, bad bot thing, Howard? I mean I know you're only a service remote, but give me a break. IR12. Come on. Frank, I'm only programmed to serve the primary protocols within the perimeters of my... Wait, wait, wait. What are your primary protocols? I'm here to keep you alive, Frank and to keep you contained within this room until you've been processed. I'm not waiting to be processed... This is the process. Do you want to try a different flavor? Just when I'm getting used to the herb and garlic dog shit one? I don't think I'm getting a handle on this sarcasm thing. Anything I can do to update the software. Hey, Frank? Yes. Why wouldn't they tell me? I don't know... if what you're telling me is true I guess it makes some kind of sense. If you're hacked into, why have evidence of anything other than eating habits, bowel movements. You never put anyone else through this process? You're my first assignment. Yeah, you might think that but they probably wipe you clean after each one. For all we know, you've done this to hundreds of people. And they don't tell you anything. I guess you're just as much a prisoner here as I am. Frank, what did you mean when you said some things weren't meant to be computerized? Doesn't matter. I'd like to know. My father died of heart disease. When he got sick they put him on this machine. Kept him alive four years. Four years longer than he was supposed to live. You think that's a gift? The man had made his peace, he was ready to go. A machine took that away from him. It trapped him in a life that wasn't even living. Everybody's so damn excited, "Look what it can do!" No one stops to think, look what it doesn't do. He was the strongest man I ever met. And I'd never seen him broken. Sometimes life's just supposed to be what it is. You know, without the latest app. No offense. I don't think there's much promise in the future between our peoples, Howard. Maybe that's just me. Interesting point. Do you really think that or is that the third default option from a menu of stupid things to say. Rhetorical? You're state of the art, Howie. I want to help you, Frank. Huh, you do? Yep, that's one of my purposes and I haven't lost sight of that. Well, don't let me stop you getting started. I did find an error. You found an error? You were transferred here on a DL9, standard. But it was processed with a KBN6 authorized default. I don't...what does that mean? Well, in so many words, you came from the same place where you were sent. That's impossible. That is an error. Technically. So, what do we do? Well, there's a SR4 Service Request for repair that may work in contacting a facilitator. But, it would be denied without... Without? Something needing repair. Yeah. Ah, okay, you sure about this? No, I'm not sure. Alright. No, wait. What? It needs to be pretty hard. I, it will be. It needs to cause damage. I gotcha Howard. I gotcha. Wait! What!? I can't... not respond. What do you mean? The problem is I know you're going to do it which forces me to take evasive action to stop you. How are you gonna stop me? There are security response systems. Like what? Well, I'm not authorized to disclose exactly... You can't tell me what they are. Frank, I'm only able to do what I'm programmed to do and I can't... Okay, I get it. You know it's coming so you'll be forced to protect yourself. Right. What are you doing? Let's think of something else. Another way. Really? Yeah, I don't wanna be tasered today or whapped by whatever high tech ass kicker you got in your tool box. So, we'll think of something else? Yeah. Gimme a coffee, would ya? Yeah, of course. No, Frank... Howard? Howard? Howard, Howard, oh, Howard, Howard, Howard. Howard. Howard! Hey, what can I get ya? Can I get ya something? Coffee? Rough day? Coffee. Alright. Here ya go. On the house. Okay? Looks like you need it. Nick. Don't, don't tell me. You out of here? Alright. Good night. William? I don't understand. They're not coming. You got stood up? Why am I still here? Hmm, that was a conscious decision on my part. You know coffee sales are all about high volume, fast turn-over, assembly lines. And I just want something more comfortable, you know, like you're at a friend's house and nobody wants to leave. Bobby? You didn't charge me for the coffee. So the scanner didn't activate. Yeah, that's another one of my problems. I, I give away free coffee and I'm like, hey, it's coffee. But I own a coffee shop, so, Freddie? Listen. You really don't know what's going on here? This, all this. This, this isn't what you, this is ah, this is, I don't-- I don't know what this is, but... Hmm, okay, ummm, okay. Well, while you figure that out, why don't you help me close, put up some chairs? Sure. Yeah. Frank. You got it. Really!? Huh. What are you doing? Could I get a coffee? Frank, if you tamper with that thing I could lose my license. No, no... I just need to see the read out. Why? Please. I need your help, Gabby. Umm, okay, ah just, ah just a, a coffee or did you want something... Gabby, please! TR-147. What does that mean? It's an IDP number. It thinks I'm someone else. They think I'm someone else. They think I'm someone else! That doesn't make any sense. I'm telling you... That doesn't make any sense. I'm telling you the read out was someone else's IDP and that read out is what brought them there in the first place. A bio-scan regulator cannot make a mistake, there is no room for error. Listen, I know you may have a hard time accepting the fact that Lithium source servers might have a flaw, God forbid, but I'm telling you what I saw. That was not my ID number. It thought I was someone else. Once I was processed into this system there was no going back. It was a mistake, the whole thing. Yeah... And there was a glitch, there was a glitch in the system that night. At the check points, at the train station. I didn't think anything about it but something went wrong. Yeah, but... Yeah, but what Howard, spit it out. You took this read out from the scanner in the coffee shop? Yeah. From inside your own memory? Yes. Pulled from your subconscious? What is your point? Is it possible that you are seeing what you want to see? Howard, I can't control what that thing makes me see. I can't alter my own subconscious any more than I could fake a broken bone in an x-ray. Which flavor is this? Tropical crap. The only access I have to administration is through the SR reports. So for us to try to get this information out... No, no, no. You're not going to try and talk to your maintenance guys again, to hell with that. We need, we need to figure out whose IDP it is. And how do we do that? Three-six-five-nine, something. You don't remember the number? But I know where I can find it. ...demanding the release of Fletcher May, leader of the Alliance, whose mysterious disappearance has sparked outrage among LFO sympathizers. Charges of illegal detainment and military strong-armed tactics have only fueled the volatile situation between the ISN... Howard? HOWARD!? Howard! I'm in here! Hello! HELP! Anybody out there!? Hey, hey, hey, hey. In here. In here! Hey, hey! Shit. I take it you don't work here either? You a prisoner too? No. I just got separated from the tour group. Ah, shit. Hey? You know what happened? Crashed the bastards. What do you mean? The Alliance. They pulled it off. Crashed the network. How do you know that? You think they forgot to pay the electric bill? They've been looking for a way in. It was always about power supply. I told them the only was is to cut the juice. ISN is nothing without hardware. What I would have given to watch the drones drop from the sky and see that whole god damn machine come to a grinding halt. Yeah. Where does that leave us? They'll find us. How will they even know where to look? Someone will be coming. I'm Fletcher May. Fletcher May? You one of my soldiers? You with the Alliance? You're Fletcher May? What do you say we get the hell out of here. Hey, where'd you get that pipe? From the shower. The bathroom walls were easier to break through. Yeah, how'd you get through the bathroom door? Mine was open when the power went out. You know, I don't think it's just the power going out. What do you mean? It felt like something bigger. In the distance. Did you hear those explosions? Maybe transformers blew or something. I think it was something more, man. Meaning what? I don't know. If they really tried to take down the ISN, the whole thing's tied together. The defense network, the fail safes. It's not just the local remotes, they could have retaliated. Retaliated. Against who? Against any one or any thing trying to take it down. Look, if it lost control over the sentinels it would have attacked itself. There's enough fire power there to wipe out everything, Fletcher. There could be no one out there. We could be all alone in here... It just didn't feel like someone pulling the plug. Come on you son of a bitch. Come on, oh yeah, here we go. I got it. I'm through! Oh, no... What's wrong? Nothing but more of the same god damn concrete! Fletcher, you still there? Where else would I be? Have they ever used that thing on you? The device? They've been trying. I was ready. There's a way to beat it. It taps into your neuro-transmitters, chemical impulses that create memory. It grabs hold of one signal, one piece that constructs that memory and follows the path to that secret. You don't need to hide the secret, just hide the path by opening a different door. What's your favorite meal as a kid? First thing that comes to mind. My father made pancakes. Think about that. Think about him. Think about the place. The smells, every detail. Can you see it? Yeah. Now, everything stays the same. Same man, same smells, same moments, but... he's making waffles. The memory stays the same but the entry point is different. They're in the right house but they kicked down the wrong door. Man, I could really go for some god damn waffles right now. Frank? Frank!? FRANK!? Hey man. We got to hold on. I'm not going to make it another night. Well you're going to have to. Okay? We have to keep it together. And wait, for what? They're never going to find us. I know that. And if the power does come back on, then what? I can't go back to that. I didn't know what was real any more. But I know this is real. And I can choose my own path. See ya, Frank. Hey, Fletcher. Stop, hey... Fletcher. Fletcher! FLETCH... Fletcher? Fletcher! Fletcher! Aw, dammit. Fletcher! 'Morning. Howard, you back? How are you feeling? Feeling? Do you know what happened in here? You don't remember? Remember, yeah I remember. The whole place was shut down. Look, there's a guy in the next cell over. You have to check. What's your name? What? I'm your LSO. Howard... Life Support Operator. You can call me Howard. Would you like something to drink? I've got three different flavors. Lime citrus, orange tropical and... You've rebooted. ...oh coffee too, I guess that's four. Want one? You've rebooted. Easy. Might want to give it a bit before going for a stroll. Do you want to hear some music? I've got a small library, assorted genres. I'm here to keep you alive, Frank. Should we get started? Do you like it? The photo? I took it. I know. Do you, can I get you something? Coffee? I'm fine. Umm, you don't need to, you know. I'm just going to sit this one out, if it's okay. Do what you do, don't worry about me. Sorry. Thank you, I appreciate the-- I just, just sit. Okay, stay as long as you want, Frank. Hey, hey ah, Gabby? Yeah, Frank. How did you know that? Which part? Ah, my name. You just said it. I mean I know that's your thing, but usually you guess. You didn't guess, you knew. Maybe because we know each other? No, we don't know each other. We, we, we do know each other from the other times, but we don't. For you each time is the first time. You understand what I'm saying? So you wouldn't, you, how would you know my name differently? Give me a minute Frank. Ah, refill, ah house blend. Sure. Oh, shit-shit-shit-shit-shit. Okay, he'll be okay. Frank? You're kind of freaking out my customers. I don't want to be scanned. I don't want to be shot again tonight. Look, this isn't what you think. It isn't? I'm not really here. No? No. You're not here, none of us here. Ah, really? Well, that would explain my profit margins. I am being held in a government facility. They're using a neuro-scanner on me right now as an interrogation program to reconstruct my memory so they can find evidence of a crime that I did not commit. So, we're actually in my memory right now. You're in my memory, I'm in my memory, we're in my memory. This is my memory. And we've been doing this quite some time, and that scanner is what malfunctioned and got me ambushed by government agents. So I don't want to be scanned tonight, okay? I don't want to buy any coffee. I'd just rather just sit here, by myself thank you. Wait to wake up in prison. That must have been one of the most interesting ways to get a free cup of coffee I have ever heard. Hands down. You win. Well... could be worse. How's that? Same day, over and over again. What if you had a two hour dentist appointment? Good point. I'll quit complaining. So, when do you go back? You know, to the bunker. I don't know. I don't control it. At least I don't think I do. Thanks for letting me stay. You're welcome. Stay as long as you like, Frank. Good morning, Frank. Would you like to go for a walk? I could play some music. You like it? The photo? Yeah, I do. Good morning, Frank. You've been in before. Would you like some coffee? You really don't know what's going on here. You know, coffee sales are all about... can't make a living out of it. Maybe I should have made you an espresso... hands down...you win. Are you feeling alright, Frank? Can I get you something? Larry, you've been in here before. The photo, I took it... couldn't make a living out of it...that's my thing. Same day, over and over again. I did find an error. What if you had a two hour dentist... I know my job. Stay as long as you like, Frank. And to keep you alive, contained in this room, until you've been processed. We're going to figure this out... no matter how long it takes. Should we get started? There's a way to beat it. Taps into your neurotransmitters. You think I say everything you want to hear? Chemical impulses that... Don't need to hide the secret... ...the path by opening a different door. Why are you after me? Why are you after me?! Why are you after me? Frank! Let them go. Frank? Let them go. Why would you let them go? They could have known something. I don't think so...you have to remember where we are. Meaning what? We're in my memory. We're in a place from the past that doesn't even exist anymore. How's a figment of my imagination know... Fine, alright. Just like you, you know this because I know this. Fine, alright. Okay. - I'm sorry. - No. Whatever. You can't hurt my feelings because I'm imaginary, right? Christ, please don't be like this. Be like what, Frank, huh? You're doing it, not me. I know this is impossible. Well, maybe you should have picked someone else, huh? I don't know, a blonde, big boobs, someone that laughs at all your jokes and does whatever you say. Why, do you know someone like that? Alright. Look, we're going to figure this out, okay? Alright? No matter how long it takes. I'm done, Howard. Plans for tonight, Frank? I'm not sure. Gabby mentioned doing something but maybe I can talk her out of it. I'd rather stay in tonight. I can make something special. You always do, Howard. You always do. Hey Frank? Yeah? You have a good day. And if you decide to stay in town, that's okay, I didn't have much planned for today, but... One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. ...but I'm sure I can think of something. I can talk to you later tonight, right? You okay, Howie? Oh yeah, I'm fine. Okay. Drop out? Same time. The count? Just over twelve. Hmm... He's reaching the end of his cycle. We're not going to see it again for another three months. Two more days? Less than that. Tomorrow? I think it has to be today. Gabby? It's fine. Hey, Gabby. It's okay. I have to get dressed. What if it doesn't work? What choice do we have? Well, what, what if he knows? He might know everything all ready. He might. You know, we could wait until the next cycle. If there is one. We might never get another shot. I can't last another three months. I know, I know. I understand. I'm just being selfish. That's not you, that's me. You're just saying what I'm thinking. Frank. Don't wreck the moment. Sorry. You think I say everything you want to hear? Definitely not. No dream girl would ever be so difficult. If I could stay with you, forever, here, I would. Well... what if there's nothing out there? What if you could come back... But there's no world to go to. What if you could get supplies and you could come back and... Okay, I know it sounds crazy but, if there is a world could you do me a favor? What's that? Find me. The real one. I don't know, maybe I'm even more incredible. You don't even know me out there. You'd probably tell me to get lost. Just find me. Okay? I will. Good morning Frank. Would you like some coffee? Yeah, thank you. Hey, you're wearing your uniform. It's a little cold. I could turn up the temperature if you'd like. No, that's alright. Light on the cream, please. Of course. Thank you, Howard. You're welcome. Thank you, Howard. You're welcome. Thank you Howard. You're welcome. Thank you Howard. You... are... welcome. How's the coffee, Frank? How's the coffee, Frank? How's the coffee, Frank? How's that coffee, Frank? Frank, how's the coffee? It's wonderful. Thank you. Howard? Yes Frank. I need the bathroom. Of course. Howard, door? Are you feeling alright, Frank? I'm fine, yeah. Bathroom, please. What's wrong? I'm not sure if I need it. Frank, are you sure there's nothing wrong... What happened? Frank, are you hurt? Frank, hold on, I'm getting help! Alright, just hold on. Hang on, just hold on. Come on, Howard! You-son-of-a-bitch! You son-of-a-bitch!!! Good morning, Frank. Would you like some coffee, Frank? There is no coffee, Howard. Would you like some breakfast? There is no breakfast, Howard. Doing the best I can here, Frank. You have to let me out. You have to let me out of this room, Howard. I can't do that. You know your job. I do. Your job is to keep me alive, remember that? You told me that the very first day we met. It is my job. If I stay in this cell, I'll die. You keep me in this place, Howard, I will die, plain and simple. I don't have that information. You have to let me go, buddy. I'm not authorized to do that. You're not authorized to let me die. I not...that not... I don't know. Howard. Howard! Listen to me. Don't turn away from me. Don't... look at me, Howard. Look at me! We need to talk about this. About what? This! This. I know why I was brought here, Howard, just as well as you do. I don't know what you mean. I was part of the Alliance. I was the one. I was the one that built the virus that was going to crash the whole system. That's what you wanted, right? The virus? To know where it was? And I knew if I told you, if I ever let you find it, I would never get out of here. You don't think I knew what that was? I knew how to beat it. I knew how to change the path so you would never find it. So you... Lied to me? I'm sorry I lied to you, Howard. I'm sorry. You've done a good job, you've kept me alive. But it doesn't matter anymore, Howard. You're broken, pal. The coffee, the shower. There's no food, Howard, you're broken and no one is coming to fix you. Well, I'll send an SR-4 Report... There is no one to receive it, there is no one left. We don't know that. You have to override the protocol, Howard. I can't do that. You have to do it, on your own, okay? I know you can do this. Stop. On your own, Howard. - Stop. - You can do this. - Stop. - You can do it. - Stop it. - I know you can! - Stop. - I know you can! Please, stop. What is your job, Howard? I can't do that, Frank. What is your job? To keep you alive. Then open the god damn door! Please... You can do this for me, Howard because we're friends. Can you do this for me, Howard? I'm sorry, Frank. I can't do that. I can only do what I'm programmed to do. I know...it's okay. How about that cup of coffee though, huh? That sounds good. Hey, Howard? Yes, Frank? How about some music, pal? What do you want to hear? Surprise me. Wonderful choice. Stop it. Stop. Stop it. Stop. Frank. Frank, what's happening? Frank, what are you doing? Frank! Frank, wake up. Frank! Frank! Howard. Help me! Howard? Frank, you there? Is that you? Frank? I'm here. You made it out? Thanks to you. What's out there? There's nothing out here. There's...you're the only thing on, Howard. Frank, can you fix me? From there? Yeah, no, I don't think so. What do we do now? I don't know. Are you coming back? No. Howard? Yes, Frank. What does LSO mean? I'm your Life Support Operator. And what's your job? I'm here to keep you alive, Frank. That's right. And, where you from? I was born in Austin, but I grew up outside Seattle, a little place not many people have heard of. But you've heard all this before because we're friends... Authorities have not yet released the name of a man, located by hikers in the Sierra Notre Mountain range in Southwest Utah. ...the sole survivor of an ISN detainment center that was abandoned by its military personnel... nearly two years ago during the EVR Liberation. ...kept alive by a computerized security system that was designed to imprison him... powered by wind terminals until the supplies were depleted... ...to avoid human rights violations to be tied to President Ebert's administration... Over three hundred detainees were discovered deceased, he is the only known living survivor. ...from Secretary of State Beckerman, "A harsh and tragic reminder of a political regime who violated our most sacred human rights. We praise your safe return and welcome you back to the new world." Do you like it? The photo? I do. I took it. I know. Can I get you something? Coffee? A coffee? Sure. Here ya go. Coffee.
