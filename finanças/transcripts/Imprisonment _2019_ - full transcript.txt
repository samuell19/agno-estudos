[English subtitles are available.] Ah! Help! Ah! Ah! The Trapped Hello, everyone. Lately, one of my colleague has been a focus. He just won the award, the Producer of the Year. We’re honored to have him here today. Welcome Mr. Ren Zhihao. Hello, I am Ren Zhihao. Hello, Zhihao. Today I’m so happy to have you here on the show. The show you produced, Follow 24 HOUR, has been another hit. It has been the network show that the netizens are most crazy about. You’re so desperate to find out the truth. Aren’t you afraid of intimidation or threat? I’m aiming to reveal the truth. Only getting to the bottom of it can the criminal be brought to justice. Conversely, the so-called threats and intimidation has been my motivation to work harder. I’ll definitely reveal the truth to the end. [Ren Zhihao tells you the conspiracy behind truth] Topics about the media producer Ren Zhihao [Ren Zhihao is about to reveal the truth] are concerned by people. Ren Zhihao is about to reveal the truth. Is it sensational? [Ren Zhihao has offended sponsors] I can't believe you even stupidly offended sponsors for the heat of the show! You may quit it. Take a long vacation. [For you] [Caution] Xiaoxi, go abroad with me if you’d like to. Let’s make a new show, Scream. Scream? That’s low. Will you go or not? Yes, I will. Ah! You wanna kill me? Ghost! Ghost! Where is it? Go to film it! Ah! Boss! Ah! So, that’s the story. It was our boss who took him to the hospital. OK. But your passport information should be checked. Come to the police station tomorrow. The doctor said you ever suffered severe burns. Why didn’t you get timely treatment? Can you tell me what exactly happened? Don't worry. I'm a media producer. I may help you if you tell me. Here. Sign this. Ren Zhihao! Anan? When did you come back? You’re a big hit now, showing on TV every day. You even didn’t go to classmates’ party, did you? [SCREAM PD Ren Zhihao] Sorry. Sorry, boss. Where is this from? [To Ren Zhihao] Um. Boss. This book looks burnt. [The things in the movies happened to me weirdly] [Am I alive or dead? I don’t know whether I’m human or ghost] [The surrounding is dark. I feel so cold] [I think I’m really mad] Here it’s neither the human world nor the hell. All the people are mad. [Here it’s neither the human world nor the hell] Who put this into the prop box? I don’t know. The prop box had been in the car. [Wu Ruoxin] Seems I've heard this name somewhere. Where is he? Why is he gone? The injured man left on his own when we were on the rounds. We didn’t know, either. Can you talk now? Wu Ruoxin is in a nursing home now. One year ago, Riverside Private Rehabilitation Center was on fire. She told us she had been kidnapped there. On the day of the fire, the whole building was burning. All the patients were dead. But we’ve checked the files. There was no Wu Ruoxin. What about her mother? Can’t she justify it for her? Her mother died of heart attack before the case. Can you arrange a meeting with her? I wanna interview her. Um. OK. I can help you, but don’t violate the principles of police. Say it. Boss. I’m confused. What does the interview of Wu Ruoxin have to do with our show? You mean Scream? How can I make that crap? Hello. The wound on your hand... Are you alright? This diary is yours, isn't it? I’m an online media producer. I’m intrigued by the content of this diary. That’s why I come here for you today. My phone number is on it. Sorry for disturbing you. [Track 24H REN ZHIHAO] [Wu Mali was killed. His daughter was arrested] Boss. This is all the information I could find. Wu Ruoxin is Wu Mali’s only daughter. She’d been studying painting abroad, yet the shooting case happened two months after her returned. I’m sorry that I didn’t even introduce myself last time. My name is Ren Zhihao. I'm interested in your story. Your paintings are full of emotions, and very abstract. Are you trying to avoid those horrible things? Where did you get that? You mean this? I’d like to know as well. But I’m more curious about whether the things on it are true. And, why did you kill people? No. I didn’t kill anyone. Never mind. You won’t believe me even if I tell you. You are right. Now I don’t believe you indeed. But it doesn’t matter whether I believe it or not. The point is whether people who want the truth will believe it. That day, I went out and walked alone on the street. Help! Let go! Are you Wu Ruoxin? Give her a bath first. Then take her to the director. Enter! What’s your name, darling? Wu Ruoxin. Miss Wu. This is Mental Rehabilitation Center. Can I take it... She’ll bite? Maybe. Of course she’ll bite. Please. Don’t be afraid. This is a place not for the mad, but for the sad. Here we have very good atmosphere and you can eat healthily. And, after treatment, you’ll be discharged and you can return home. David. Wu Ruoxin. Take medicine. To live, you have to take it. Or I have to take another way and you’ll be hurt. Please. Please help me. I’m not crazy. I’m not insane. Please make a call for me. Someone will surely pick me up. Please. Please help me. Just one call! Just one! Remember. Patients shall not use any sharp things here. That’s the rule. What are you doing? [Patient Health Summary] You can’t even feed her medicine. Scumbag. Eat. Rag doll. Rag doll. Black eyes, long hair. Bang, bang, bang. Rag doll. Sis. You look so weird. Are you also sick? I’m not. I’m not sick. I’m just like you. I'm not sick either. I was sent here by my husband. He said I am sick. My husband had a baby with another woman, so he abandoned me. I’m also kidnapped here. Do you want to get out of here? Only that freak can help you out. Who? Earthworm. Sis. Earthworm. I caught many earthworms yesterday and ate them all with ice cream. So delicious. If only I had some nail polish. I actually love fried chicken. But I can’t have fried chicken. Because I kept eating fried chicken, kept eating, kept eating, and then the baby’s home was blocked. Sis. Can I swap with you? Don’t you get it? Give your womb to me. Let’s swap the baby's home, OK? Let’s swap. Let’s swap. Let's swap. Let’s swap baby’s home. Please! Swap with me! Swap with me! David. David. Hold her. I’ve heard that you’ve been refusing to take your medicines and treatment? I'm not sick. Who asked you to keep me here? Paranoia. I’m not mad. I’ve said I’m normal. I’m not mad. Illusions and self-denial. It’s illegal imprisonment. I’m gonna sue you. Increase the dosage to quell the outburst. I'm not sick! Let me go! I’m not sick! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Victor Wu Ruoxin mentioned was the director of Riverside Private Rehabilitation Center where the fire broke out. Wu Mali, who was shot dead, was his fellow apprentice. His own daughter was in his fellow apprentice’s Rehabilitation Center, yet there’s no any record. Why? Wu Ruoxin was kidnapped on the street, and forcibly taken to the Center. So... So, he sent his daughter there deliberately. Black eyes, long hair. Rumbling. Baby is hungry and stomach is rumbling. Let me be your good mom. Bang, bang, bang. Bang, bang, bang. Rag doll. Rag doll. Black eyes, long hair. Rumbling. Baby is hungry and stomach is rumbling. Let me be your good mom. Rag doll. Rag doll. Black eyes, long hair. Let me be your good mom. Rag doll. Rag doll. Rag doll. Black eyes, long hair. I’ll be... Still feeling blocked? Come here. Come here. In that place, some people think it's heaven. Some people think it’s hell. Some people think it’s home. You asked for this. [Archives File] If I were locked there, I’d go mad as well. The point is that why Wu Ruoxin was locked there? Is it Here? Yeah, over there. Hello, are your parents at home? Who are you asking for? They said my husband owed them lots of money, so he ran away. When did you see your husband last time? Last time Dad came home was on my brother's birthday. What day was it? June 14 of the year before last. [Cui Weiping (male) 2014.6.14] Black eyes, long hair. In your dairy, there’s a treatment room, right? Yes. Many patients were taken there. I did everything to escape. Let me go! Let me go! You haven't made the call for me, have you? I can’t get out of here, right? Only with the consent of your guardian. Do you want to get out of here? Only that freak can help you out. Come here. Do you feel lonely? Is there really a secret way out? How will you tell me? You cunt. Wait for me in the bathroom tomorrow morning. Where is the secret passage? In the director’s office. What’s the password? 7. 7... Lulu. You know the password, right? Tell me the password. Rag doll. Rag doll. Black eyes, long hair. OK. Just tell me the password, alright? Please! Tell me! Rag doll. Rag doll. Black eyes, long hair. Prepare for surgery. Sir. Wu... Wu Ruoxin is gone. She disappeared? What the hell. Find her now! Yes, sir. Wu Ruoxin! David! David. Do I have to teach you how to do it? What am I paying you for? Fix it, now! Help! Help! Alright. Got it. [POLICE] Here we are. Get off. Help! It’s OK, darling. It’ll be over soon. Just think something pleasant. Anesthesia. No! No! No! Who do you think sent you to the Center? In your book, you wrote that he’s a demon. Who is he exactly? Is he Wu Mali? Wu Mali? That horrible demon refers to your father, Wu Mali. Right? My father passed away when I was young. My head hurts so much. I don’t wanna talk anymore. She fainted suddenly, maybe because she suffered severe irritation. It’s about irritability, protecting herself with specific memories. Madam. I have something important to tell you. Damen Transnational Group is the family business of Wu Ruoxin’s mother, Li Zhenni. Li Zhenni’s father made a will before he died, letting her inherit 70 percent stake in Lanwen Damen Group, leaving the other 30 percent to his granddaughter, namely Wu Ruoxin. Wu Mali is Wu Ruoxin’s stepfather. For the public, Wu Mali is the president of Damen Group. In fact, Li Zhenni is the biggest shareholder of the group. One year ago, Li Zhenni died of heart attack. She made a will to transfer all her stakes in Lanwen to Wu Mali. But Wu Mali was not satisfied. He allowed the director of the Private Rehabilitation Center, Victor, to forcibly lock Wu Ruoxin up there receiving the so-called treatment so that he can get all the stakes of the Group from Wu Ruoxin. Why are you investigating this? Because I’m seriously applying to you that I have to return to Follow 24 HOUR to do the justice. Cheers. Anan. I'm on my way. Don’t rush. She doesn’t want to see you now. Just wait. You’ll have the slot next week. But listen, I only want the name, Wu Mali. She fainted suddenly, maybe because she suffered severe irritation. It’s about irritability, protecting herself with specific memories. Wu Ruoxin is indeed locked... locked in Riverside Private Rehabilitation Center. Ad is over. Ready. 3. 2. 1. Go. [FOLLOW 24] Do you still remember the case that the president of Damen Group, Wu Mali, was shot to death one year ago? The suspect is Wu Mali’s daughter, Wu Ruoxin. After the thorough investigation by our program, we found something behind the scene. On the same day as the shooting, [Live streaming Rehabilitation Center] a fire broke out in a Private Rehabilitation Center. The director of the Center is Wu Mali’s fellow apprentice. [Wu Mali, Victor, Wu Ruoxin, Rehabilitation Center ] Wu Ruoxin was once kidnapped into this Private Rehabilitation Center and illegally imprisoned. A normal person was blatantly kidnapped and taken away forcibly. The outrageous case happened right under our nose. Although there is no hospitalization record about Wu Ruoxin in this Rehabilitation Center, our program has overcome many obstacles and finally found an employee who ever worked there. He corroborated this case. [Phone interview Rehabilitation Center] Wu Ruoxin is indeed locked... locked in Riverside Private Rehabilitation Center. What happened at the Center on earth? Why was Wu Ruoxin forcibly kidnapped into the Center? Who were the guys taking her there? Follow 24 HOUR. I will take you through all the mist and reveal the truth. Stay tuned for the next episode. Ren Zhihao. Stop there. Are you nuts? Who asked you to do the next episode? You didn’t get to interview Wu Ruoxin, did you? Rest assured. She will meet me. Next episode will surely be aired. Listen up. If you screw this again, you’ll be fired. Boss. What took you so long? Come and have a look. Hurry up. Look, netizens' reviews on this episode. We're closer to the truth. I’m gonna bring it to light. Hello. Wu Ruoxin wants to see you. Sorry. It’s aired without your permission. What was the show about? I want people to believe you. Did people really believe I was taken there? In that place, only one person believed me. The one who helped you escape was Lin Feng? Actually, there's something I didn't tell you. [Missing person declaration form] Please help me find her. I haven’t heard from her for days. Someone went to save me the other night. I don’t know what to do. They said she’s hospitalized, yet didn’t tell me which hospital it was. I... Hello? Hello? Only he didn’t give up to the end. Get me a new incubator. Place it up. What the hell are you doing? Clear this up! I asked you to clean this up. Where do you think your great salary comes from? Darling? Who the hell do you do this job for? Do you get it? Who am I? Tell me. Look at me. Who am I? You’re the director. Then clean this up. I have Wu Ruoxin with me. She’ll die if you’re late. Call me when you arrive. Don’t get found out. Perfect. Clean this up, boys. [Death Center] What should we do next? Confidentiality. Certainly. How... You’ve promised future profits of this Center... Idiot. You can’t even keep an eye on a woman. Are you Li Yizhuo? Um. Ruoxin. Ruoxin. Hush. There’s no time. Go now. You bastard. Pervert. You’re crazy. Get him up. My fault. It’s my fault! It’s my fault. Don't hurt him. Don't hurt him. Please! No anesthesia. -Let’s go. -No! Please! Don't! Don't! I know. I know. I know. I know it’s tough. For me, too. My mind is a mess today. All of this is because of your father. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang, bang, bang. This is your death certificate. What I might do is slitting your stomach, taking your guts. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. If you need someone to hate, you should hate Wu Mali. You’re crazy. Rag doll. Black eyes, long hair. Rumbling. Rumbling. Hungry and stomach is rumbling. Let me be your good mom. Bang. Bang. Bang. You crazy dog. Let go of Ruoxin. Or I’ll kill you. I was wrong! I was wrong! Please forgive me. Don’t! Let me be your good mom. Forgive me. Don’t! Don't hurt him. Don’t! Rag doll. Rag doll. Black eyes, long hair. Let me be your good mom. Rag doll. Rag doll. Black eyes, long hair. Sir, there’s a fire! Rag doll. Let me be your good mom. Rag doll. Rag doll. Bang. Bang. Bang. Rag doll. Sis. What are you guys playing? Lulu. It’s fun! Lulu. Untie us. Let's go out together. Alright? Untie me. I can’t go. Baby’s home is blocked. You can’t go either. Bang, bang, bang. Lulu. I give you the baby... I give you the baby's home, alright? Really? Yes. Are you sure? Yes. Untie me. Rag doll. Rag doll. Untie me, Lulu! Baby. Lin Feng. Baby’s home. I want... Are you alright? Baby’s home... Sis. Where are you going? Aren’t we swapping baby’s home? Yes. Yes. Ruoxin. Do it. Give it to me. Give it to me. We’re all gonna die here. OK? Bang. Bang. Bang. Ruoxin. Rag doll. Bang. Bang. Bang. We can go out. We will make it. We will make it. Ruoxin. Ruoxin. Dad. Dad. Boss. Many netizens commented that Wu Ruoxin killed her father. Why don’t you deceive her once? I’ll ask you one last question. Do you remember whom you went to after you got out? Your father. You killed him and got caught red-handed. You killed your own father. No. My father passed away when I was young. You don’t have to tell me everything. Wu Ruoxin, just tell me one thing. Wu Mali and Victor had many shady dealings. I wanna air them as the highlight of the show. Revealing their true color is greatly good for you. Do you know what I mean? Wu Ruoxin. Who sent you to the Rehabilitation Center exactly? Who sent you there and imprisoned you illegally? Who was that guy? I can’t recall it. Tell me. Say it. Say it. I can’t... I can’t recall anything. You disappointed me so much. - You’re lying. - Hao. Watch your emotions. You must know it. You know Who Wu Mali is. You just won’t talk. Stop acting. You won’t tell until some consequences, right? No. My father passed away when I was young. Alright. Let me help you recall it. Alright? Victor. Wu Mali. Wu Mali. Look at this family photo. You, and your mother. This is your father, Wu Mali, your stepfather. You killed him, your stepfather! Ren Zhihao. Get out if you can’t control yourself. Let’s end this meeting. What about now? Have you recalled it? No beating around the bush. Let’s cut to the chase. I think you disliked your stepfather from the very beginning. You didn’t want him to be your father. So you went abroad right after college, worked for money and led a hard life like a dog. Wu Mali went to you, trying to improve the relationship. You got sick of him and hated him more and more. That's why you were sent to the Center by him. Right? Of course. It could be like this. Wu Mali sent men to take you to Victor’s Rehabilitation Center and treat you secretly, leaving no record at all. Why? For his daughter's future, namely for your future. Your father is really the best father in the world. By the way, you were furious that your mother transferred the stakes of the Group to your stepfather. All the inheritance should have been yours, yet Wu Mali got it, and you got nothing. You must be very upset. I would have been the same. At that time, the Center caught fire, and you're the only survivor. Then Wu Mali was killed. Wu Mali, your stepfather. You thought it’s all his fault. It’s he who got you into the Center. And your mother’s death! You hated his guts, and you wanted to bite him to death, right? At last, you shot him and killed him. You killed your father. Right? No. No. No. You have no idea what a man he was . You have no idea how he treated my mother and how he treated me. You don’t know anything! I'm sorry, Mom. Why? Why? I want to kill him. I even dreamed to kill him. But he was already dead. When I arrived, he was already dead. [Rehabilitation Center Follow 24 HOUR] Riverside Private Rehabilitation Center didn’t have any relevant qualifications. It’s an underground business set by Wu Mali together with his fellow apprentice, Victor, serving those who handsomely paid them, specifically to send normal people there in the name of psychosis, torturing and mutilating them by all means so as to achieve their ulterior motives. Everything Wu Ruoxin suffered was all plotted by his stepfather to cover up his own crimes. Thanks to the fire in the Center, Wu Ruoxin escaped and survived. If Wu Ruoxin is brave enough to testify, Wu Mali will lose everything. Surrounded by stress and fear, he may get irrational in an instant. [Live streaming Rehabilitation Center] At that moment, what choice will Wu Mali make? Justice has long arms. The day has eyes, and the night has ears. That’s all for this episode. See you next time. You said you quit smoking. Boss. This show is a great success. What if I make the wrong judgment? Will people still believe me? No way. There are so many evidences. As long as you don't think I'm stupid, I’ll follow you all the time. Boss. You not only take back the show this time, but also clear Wu Ruoxin's name. You're my idol. However, Wu Ruoxin is pitiful. She has no family even if she’s out. Why was her mother’s death certificate also issued by Victor? How does it feel to go home? Do you know where your mother’s tomb is? There. In the Rehabilitation Center. A pen like this could also be a murder weapon. Patients were not allowed to have it. You know? Remember. Patients aren't allowed to use sharp objects here. Who put this book in the prop box? I don’t know. The prop box had been in the car. Actually, there's something I didn't tell you. The other night, someone went to save me. Dad. I’m back. [Missing person declaration form] Can you help me find her? I haven’t heard from her for days. We’ve learned about your situation. Your father said your mother was hospitalized. I have your mother. She’ll be dead if you’re late. Hurry. Are you Wu Ruoxin? [Wu Ruoxin] Wu Ruoxin. Seems I've heard this name somewhere. Boss, it’s a phone call. She insisted that you should listen. Who? Listen. Hello, this is Ren Zhihao. I'm Wu Ruoxin. My mom is missing. I don’t know what to do. They told me she was hospitalized, yet didn’t tell me which hospital it was. I’m in a meeting. You may call me later. Your name is Li Zhenni? Hold her. I'm not sick. I'm not crazy. I’ve told you I’m well. Let go of me! I wanna call my daughter. Let me go! I'm not crazy. We will get out. Can you forgive me? No! No! Mom! Mom! Hello. Police station? This is Ren Zhihao. [On April 1, 2018, testified by Ren Zhihao, Ruoxin was found guilty of intentional homicide,] [and sentenced to death accordingly, with one-year suspension of execution.] [While serving her sentence, she actively revealed Wu Mali’s criminality,] [thus commuted to life imprisonment by Lanwen Supreme Court.] [Note: It’s illegal to abuse patients, remove organs and detain people in this film.]
