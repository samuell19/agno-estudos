Hurry up, darling, you'll be late. (Albert) 'Coming, mother.' [clock chimes] [banging on ceiling] - Darling. - 'Yes, mother, coming.' 'Come along, now, and sit down, darling.' 'Don't let your breakfast get cold.' Good morning, mother. How's your rheumatism? Oh, I hardly slept a wink. I'm sure it's going to rain, it never fails. Here's the newspaper. - Newspaper lies. - Shh. 'You may find something interesting in it today.' [woman laughing] Milk? How did you get it, mother? [whispers] The doctor gave me a prescription. Are you sick, mother? Oh, have I ever been well? Never since you were born. Not that I blame you, my darling. No, no, no, you know I can't stand milk. I never could. But there's no reason why you shouldn't take advantage of my condition. Yeah, you were so weak as a child. 'The only way I saved your life' 'was by giving you plenty of milk.' 'It's shocking now, so many cows in the country' 'and no milk.' [clicking tongue] Oh, look...your coat.. That filthy cat. Mmm, come now, take it off, and let me brush it. 'Wish that girl would keep her cat at home where it belongs.' 'That's why I couldn't sleep.' 'That yowling all night on the roof.' I thought it was your rheumatism. My rheumatism and the cat. Come now, pick up your milk. Oh ho ho, you bad boy. Ha ha ha. Yeah, some people are getting milk. And they don't need a prescription for it either. At the mayor's house, they have cream on the table every morning. A whole pitcher of it, ha ha. 'Oh, our mayor is doing alright.' So are the merchants. Black markets. That's why there's no food to sell on the coupons. Selling meat and butter out the back door 'for ten times its price.' 'Nobody thinks of raising your salary, my dear.' Oh-ho, no. The schoolmaster must starve while men who can't even spell their own names get rich. Ah, well...at least we have order. Things are quiet in the town now thank the Lord, so I suppose we shouldn't complain. Drink up your milk. [dramatic music] What's that? Liberty. [patriotic music] "Citizens, do not believe in the generosity "of the conquerors. "If they are not driven out of our land.. "...it means generations of slavery for our people. "We must resist. Let each of us say to himself, this land is mine." - Troublemakers. - Yeah. This is dangerous, mother. I'd better burn it. No, no, no, not here. They might see you. I'll watch here. Can't even trust your neighbors nowadays. [dramatic music] That stupid cat, go, tch, tch, tch. - Go, tch, tch. - Mother.. Now, Albert, hurry up, you'll be late for school. [clock chimes] - Goodbye. - Goodbye, my darling. Edmund! Hurry up! - Good morning, Mr. Lory. - Good morning.. - Good morning. - Hello, Mr. Lory. My sister's been looking all over for that cat. - Oh, good morning. - Good morning. - So, there's the runaway. - Yeah. Aren't you ever gonna stay at home? 'Was she annoying your mother again?' Not at all. We're very fond of her. My brother had a flat tire. Is it fixed yet, Paul? It'll hold out till I reach the railroad yard. I'm waiting for Edmund Lorraine. Edmund! He's coming, Mr. Lory. Do you mind if we wait for him? - Not if you walk very fast. - 'Ask him to dinner.' (Paul) 'We're gonna have a real feast tonight.' Why don't you come? George Lambert's coming. Coming? He's bringing the dinner. 'She's got George chasing pigeons.' Paul, don't be so silly. What's silly about anything to eat? 'I couldn't figure out yesterday what George' 'was doing in the roof of the freight office.' I found out last night when he brought my sister some pigeons. - He's got traps up there. - Will you come, Mr. Lory? Oh, thank you. My mother doesn't like to be left alone. - You know, she's not very well. - I'm very sorry. Have you seen this, Mr. Lory? Paul! Paul, don't be crazy! - Watch out. - Why? Soldiers. Hey, Hans, you wanna read something? Looks like someone's trying to compete with our official newspaper. Where you get this, Paul? Under the door. You find many of this already? - All over town? - Yeah? - If you find any more, tell us. - Sure. [shouting] And at your house? No. You're very smart, aren't you? Listen, I don't want to get into trouble. Those boys are alright. They're just doing their job. - And are you doing yours? - Oh, sure. Just as fast as I can get there. Why pick on me? You don't say anything to George. [bicycle bell rings] Hi, Paul. Now, don't tear my stockings. You're just like all women thinking of your legs all the time. [bells dinging] Edmund, come along, we're late. - Come on. - Come on. [bell dinging] [children shouting] [bell dinging] (male #1) 'These books must be burned, Professor Sorel.' By your order, Mr. Mayor, or by the order of the enemy? "Juvenal. "Voltaire. "Plato. The Republic." My dear friend, we have to be careful about that word republic. Would you like to have my resignation? By no means, by no means, my dear Sorel. We need you. You have the respect of the whole community. I only want you, for your own sake to understand our problems a little more clearly. I'm so sorry, Mr. Mayor. We were told Professor Sorel-- Come in. Come ahead, Lory. I'm just leaving. Good morning, Miss Martin. Is anything wrong? Yes, Louise. Come here, please. - Come here, Mr. Lory. - Yes, sir. It's a very delicate surgical operation. Cut out the heart without killing the patient. It is true our country, however, is a very tough, old patient, and we'll do the best we can. We start here with Charlemagne. [indistinct chattering] (female #1) 'Get down, kids, here he comes!' Why do they make us do this-this dirty work? Can't they bring in the German soldiers and get it over with? Don't be upset, Louise. After all, it's only a few pages. Oh, Albert. [door slams shut] [children laughing] [children laughing] Vincent, grab the duster. [door closes] [bangs book shut] [children giggling] [rustling] [clears throat] Until our new school books are supplied we are going to make a few, uh...corrections. Um...uh, Edmund Lorraine. 'You'll collect the pages after they're torn out' and burn them in the stove. Uh...ahem, pages 7 and 8. [paper ripping] Pages, uh, 15, 16. [ripping continues] (Albert) '17, 18.' [ripping continues] Pages 21 and 22. Now, tear them out carefully. Page 30. [rustling] [ripping] [siren blaring] - It's the British! - 'Emily, don't be nervous.' We have plenty of time. We must take shelter.. ...even from our friends in the sky. Now...when you pass out... I want you to give me all the pages that you've already taken out of your books. The day will come when we'll paste them back where they belong. [siren blaring] [blaring continues] Order, young men. Don't let the girls be better soldiers than the men. Sir, could I go get my mother? - She's so afraid of the raids. - Go ahead, Mr. Lory. [siren blaring] [siren blaring] Albert, who are you running from? Why aren't you in the shelter? [indistinct shouting] [blaring continues] (Emma) Albert! [Emma groans] [explosions] [banging on door] Professor Sorel! Professor Sorel! [banging continues] There's room over here, Mrs. Lory. [groans] Oh, yeah, you move over here, darling. There's a draft in this cellar. He catches cold easily. His lungs are weak. [children imitating airplanes] Shh, now they're over us! - Four engines. - Wellingtons. No, no, they're Americans. Gee, just listen to them. [children imitating airplanes] Shh! [airplanes droning] [missile whistling] [imitates a blast] [explosions] (Emma) 'It's outrageous, bombing innocent civilians!' Why don't they stay at home? Things are bad enough as they are. I wish I could see the sky full of them, Mrs. Lory. Why don't they bomb Germany, young woman? Every factory and railroad in Europe is Germany, Mrs. Lory until the Germans are driven out. [explosions continue] [missile whistling] [explosions] Now, Emily, don't be frightened. There's nothing to be worried about. We're perfectly safe down here. It'll all be over in a few minutes. [missile whistling] [explosions] [children laughing] (boy #1) Hey, look at Mr. Lory. [children laughing] [children imitating airplanes] [imitating Albert and Emma] Young men. [missile whistling] [explosions] Let's all sing. Now, if we sing loud enough we won't be able to hear the guns at all. And I know Julian Lamont has a good strong voice. Girls, we don't want the boys to sing any louder than we do. Now, are you all ready? One, two. ♪ Ting-a-ling Ring-o-ring ♪ ♪ School bells in the steeple ♪ ♪ Ting-a-ling Ring-o-ring ♪ ♪ Calling all the people ♪ ♪ Time to run away from play ♪ ♪ Work begins another day ♪ ♪ Ting-a-ling Ring-o-ring ♪ [explosions continue] ♪ Ting-a-ling Ring-o-ring ♪ ♪ School bells in the steeple ♪ ♪ Slowly swing another ring ♪ ♪ Calling all the people ♪ ♪ Hear the pealing clear and high ♪ ♪ Like some angels in the sky ♪ ♪ Ting-a-ling Ring-o-ring.. ♪ [bell chiming] [children shouting] [knocking on door] [chiming continues] (Sorel) Come in. You wished to see me, Professor Sorel? - Yes, Mr. Lory. - I know what you're gonna say. I know I'm ridiculous. I'm stupid and I'm weak. I can't help it, sir. - I'm a coward. - No, no. Yes, sir, I'm a coward. I can't stand violence. It terrifies me. Noises and explosions, something happens to me. I'm a coward and I can't conceal it from the boys any longer. They see it. They saw it this morning. Well, you saw it, sir. Even Miss Martin. - Sit down, Mr. Lory, sit down. - No, sir. Now she knows I'm a coward. 'Would you like to be transferred to a district' 'where there are no air raids?' - No, no, no, sir. - Because of Miss Martin? Yes. Does she know how you feel? I thought you were a confirmed bachelor like me. Oh, well, like all young men, I fell in love. But she died. And I found great comfort in my work...our work. My family became this school, my books, my teachers you and Miss Martin my pupils, many of them grown up now. It's a wonderful thing to be a schoolmaster. It's a lifework, Lory. You sacrifice a lot of things, but you get a lot in return. And now I believe, we are the most important people in our country. It's a time for sacrifice, now, more than ever. And our real happiness lies in doing our job well. Our mayor was in here this morning talking about duty. But I prefer to use the word "job." These books must be burned. Very well then, we must burn them. We can't resist physically. But morally, within us, we can resist. We contain those books, we contain truth. They can't destroy the truth without destroying each and every one of us. We can keep the truth alive if the children believe in us and follow our example. Children like to follow a leader. And they have two kinds of leaders today. We seem weak. We have no weapons, we don't march except to air-raid shelters. And our heroes are called criminals and shot against walls. The other leaders have guns tanks, parades, uniforms. They teach violence, self-love, vanity everything that appeals to the unformed minds of children. And their criminals are called heroes. Well, that's a lot of competition for us, Lory. 'Love of liberty isn't glamorous for children.' 'Respect for the human being isn't exciting.' But there's one weapon they can't take away from us. And that's our dignity. It's gonna be a fight, Lory. It is a fight. But if the children admire us, they will follow us. [explosion] [indistinct shouting] [siren blaring] We will win, Lory. Or maybe we'll get shot. But every one of us they execute wins a battle for our cause because he dies a hero and heroism is glamorous for children. Oh, I don't ask you to die, my friend. Not immediately. You can think these things over. I'm sure you'll find them helpful when.. ...we are visited by our friends in the sky. You think you can handle your class and feel less nervous next time? - Yes, sir, I'll try. - Good. - Professor Sorel. - Yes, Victor? What's the trouble? There's been a wreck at the railroad yard. - Supply train. - Now it begins. I'm afraid so, sir. They'll take hostages even if this is an accident. Now we've got to be strong, Lory. [dramatic music] [hissing] This one, number nine. I haven't touched her since. - Seem to operate alright? - Yes, sir. I closed the switch. I watched the freight back into the terminal. I expected it to go back but instead it moved on the main track just as the train was coming in. It was too late to do anything. See if it works now. - Control cable's broken. - Cut. - You know nothing about it? - No, sir. It was alright when I pulled it. I'm sure of that. You turned in an illegal newspaper this morning. - That's right, sir. - Any idea where it comes from? [train chugging] No, sir. If you do get an idea, will you report it? I think so. Martin...this was an accident. [clangs] - You understand? - Yes, sir. [train chugging] [bell ringing] Well, what do you think, Hans? Am I in a jam? Ach, no. - You smoke and forget it, Paul. - Thanks. What's the old man up to? Why does he call it an accident? We never ask questions. [train whistle blowing] (Louise) 'Oh, Julie.' - Julie, where's George? - He's in his office. He's in an awful temper. Louise...I'm worried about Paul. I just saw that fat pig leave the switch tower. If the boss asks for me, tell him I've gone to the warehouse. You don't have to worry about Paul. (George) 'No, no, don't stop work. Go ahead and load number four.' 'We'll have the tracks cleared within an hour.' - Speed it up now. - George. Oh, hello, darling. Well, the men will have to work overtime. If there are any complaints, refer 'em to me. That's right. Call me back as soon as you're finished. [train chugging] I'm afraid, I'm in for some trouble, Louise. You saw the wreck? Everything's in a mess. - I'm worried, George. - Me too. Dunno how it happened. I checked with Paul, everything was alright at the switch tower. You know how hard I work to keep everything moving. Now the chances are they'll hold me accountable. George, I'm sorry. Perhaps I'm selfish, but I'm thinking about myself. Something happened today that I don't understand. What, Louise? I went out to buy things for dinner tonight. I'd to stand in line for long. When I returned home, the house was searched. I.. [knock on door] Excuse me, Lambert, if I'm intruding. - I thought you were alone. - That's alright. - You know my adjutant? - Yes. I was expecting you, sir. Louise, this is Major von Keller and Captain Schwartz. Miss Martin. [train chugging] I know Miss Martin very well even if she doesn't seem to know me. As protector of the town, it's my duty, Miss Martin to know what our teachers are teaching...and thinking. How are your friends in the sky? I wanted to talk to you alone, George. I'll see you later. Go ahead, Miss Martin, don't mind me. She wants to ask you about some papers she's lost. Not lost. Stolen. My report to my superior says neither. The forbidden pages were burned. 'We protect the people we like' 'from their own mistakes.' - What did you do, Louise? - 'Nothing, Lambert.' Nothing at all, except prove our efficiency. I found out what I wanted to ask you, George. I'll see you tonight. Don't be disturbed, Lambert. We've more important matters to discuss. I've just been making an investigation of the wreck. A very unfortunate accident, Lambert. I wouldn't call it an accident, Major von Keller. Neither would I. It was sabotage. When they began circulating that illegal newspaper I knew we'd have trouble. This won't be the end of it. - There anyone you suspect? - I don't know. Who prints the newspaper? Every workman in this railroad yard gets a copy of one. Find the men who print the newspaper and you'll find your saboteurs. Very logical but not very helpful. And not very intelligent for either of us to use the word "sabotage." It is sabotage. You don't understand, my friend. Look...if we call it sabotage I shall have to take hostages from the town and shoot them finally if the guilty are not found. I don't like to shoot innocent people. And I don't like to make martyrs. Once you begin that it never stops until finally, we find ourselves sitting on a powder keg. I see. I've noticed what happens in our districts which we are protecting. The taking of hostages will make the guilty men only more cautious. And the shooting will make them more rebellious. Next time, it'll be a troop train that is wrecked. Fortunately, no German soldiers were killed. Eggs, meat, potatoes, whatever has been destroyed by this accident can be replaced. The good citizens of this town will eat a little less and talk a little more. You can't be blamed for an accident. Meantime, we keep our ears open. I have many ears, as you know. And you're in touch with all the men who work here. Do you think they'd tell me anything? I'm just the man who gives orders around here. They regard anybody who gives orders as an enemy. I can remember when we had the same problem in Germany.. ...during the Republic, under capitalism. I fought in the streets for our fuehrer, Lambert. I killed workers with my own hands. With both hands then. For my class it was either kill or be killed. But we won and now we are brothers. Absolute obedience. I too fought the unions, Major von Keller. Right here in this yard. I was very nearly killed. You had a leader and were many. We had no leader and were few. - That's why you're here. - But not as your enemy. If I thought you were, I wouldn't be doing this. I know that. We're here to help men like you rebuild your own country. Remember what my country was before our fuehrer? A country without food, without arms, without honor. But the people weren't dead. They were only waiting to be told the truth. By the glory of the Third Reich that we have shed German blood to give that truth not only to your people but to the Aryans of the whole world. Your ideas are exactly my ideas. I saw how our country was destroyed. False democratic ideas, women refusing to have children strikes in all our factories for a 40-hour week when your people were working 70 and 80 hours a week. I want the new order for my country. I worked for it. But I know that we can't have it until this war is over. I must tell you a truth. I don't like the occupation. Neither do I. I'm glad we understand each other. We are both working for this war to be over. Only then can we have a peaceful and united Europe. And only then can your country and men like you regain their dignity and honor. Let us both work for that day. [train whistle blowing] [indistinct murmuring] Sorry, Fraulein, but you must keep in line. [indistinct murmuring] The sound of the mob, Mr. Mayor. I don't like the way they look. You don't have to worry, Major von Keller. Break up the printing presses, you break up rebellion. [rustling] [indistinct murmuring] Quiet! Let's go ahead. [engine revving] [crowd murmuring] [explosion] [dramatic music] [whistle blowing] [speaking in foreign language] [indistinct chattering] [dramatic music] [speaking in foreign language] [music continues] [whistle blowing] [music continues] [gunshot] [music continues] [gunshot] [music continues] [gunshot] - Hello, Mrs. Lory. - Ah, ah, ah. [instrumental music] Hello, Paul. There's been some trouble. Did you hear the shooting? Paul, what's the matter? - Paul! - It's nothing. I'm alright. Paul. Paul, it was you. Oh, Paul, why didn't you tell me? Paul, it was you, it was you, it was you. Oh, now, you're the brother I've always been so very proud of. Oh, Paul, I can believe in you again. [sobbing] [soft music] [speaking in foreign language] Well, that settles it. The man got away. Not even recognized. This concerns you too, Mr. Mayor. An attempt was made upon your life as well as mine. Well, have you any suggestions? What about the two men you arrested? They must know who it was. I'm afraid you don't understand your own people. I know these men. We had them in Germany. Fanatics. They'll die but they'll tell nothing. And I'm afraid, I'll have to take hostages. I don't like to begin it but two German soldiers have been killed. - I'm sorry, Major von Keller. - I appreciate your sentiments. But this time my superiors won't accept any apologies. Have you ever studied this paper? "They make a desert and they call it peace." That's classical flavor. - Who wrote that? - Why, the two men you arrested. Oh, no. No, my dear mayor. They were only printers. Workmen. They're the hands, I'm looking for the brain. This shows scholarship. Schwartz, give me that list of books you found on the desk of Professor Sorel. "Voltaire, Plato, Juvenal, Tacitus.." Tacitus! [speaking in foreign language] - You recognize it, Manville? - Is it Greek? It's Latin. Tacitus was speaking of the Roman occupation. "They make a desert and they call it peace." Well, we've got it. Surely you don't suspect, my old friend Sorel? I've known Sorel all my life. He's always been a little radical. Crazy ideas. I never agreed with him but he's one of the most respected men in this town. He'd never make an attempt on my life. Of course not, my dear Manville. Here, have a glass of wine. Let's drink a toast... to Tacitus. [children clamoring] (Albert) 'Boys, boys, boys!' What have you been doing? I'm very disappointed in you. This is a place of learning and culture. And the first requisite of culture is good manners. 'I've kept dignity in this classroom' 'but if you continue to misbehave' 'I shall have to report you to the principal.' Edmund...what's that on your face? They say I'm a Jew. Who did it? I don't know, sir. Edmund, go to the washroom and clean your face. Mr. Lory, Mr. Lory, Mr. Lory, come quickly, please. They're arresting Professor Sorel. (Albert) Professor Sorel! Professor Sorel! They mustn't take you. Don't leave us. Don't leave us. W-we can't run the school without you. The boys are getting outta hand. Don't leave us. Dignity, Lory. You can run the school. Stop it! Let go! You can't take him! I won't let you! [indistinct chattering] (boy #2) 'Father!' - Father! Father! - It's alright, son. Don't worry, I'll come back. You go home and comfort your mother. You're the man now. [engine sputtering] You're a brave boy, Edmund. And so are you, Albert. [instrumental music] I'm afraid you're wasting your time, Miss Martin. And mine too. You surely can't have anything against Professor Sorel. Everyone in the town knows him and respects him. A lot of us love him. He's a fine man, a good man. And he writes very well. - I admire his style. - He's a kind man. You oughta know that he'd never do anything violent. - And Mr. Lorraine-- - Is a Jew. What will happen to them? Miss Martin two German soldiers were murdered today out there in the street. If the criminal doesn't give himself up within a week ten hostages will be shot. But not by me. Their deaths will be caused by the cowardice of the criminal who refuses to confess his guilt. You mean, you'd shoot innocent men? I told you I've nothing to do with it. But I confess I don't find myself grieving for the innocence of Sorel. Your own hostility to me reflects his teaching. And you pass it on to your children. These ideas are contagion. And the place to eliminate them is in the schools. 'You can make a child believe whatever you want.' 'The children of today' are the soldiers and mothers of tomorrow. Ten years ago, our German children were like yours. But we National Socialists threw out the Sorels and took over the schools. And look at them now. Heroes who have conquered the world. No, no, you can't. You never will. My dear child, if I didn't know you were going to be married to a very reliable man, I'd be worried about you. Thank you, Major von Keller, for helping me to understand exactly what this occupation means. Thank you for your company, Miss Martin. And don't worry too much about Sorel. We have ways of finding out things. The chances are we'll find the guilty man. My regards to Lambert. And save me a piece of the wedding cake. [train whistle blowing] George? They've arrested Professor Sorel. Poor darling. Don't cry. Come and sit down. I know how you feel, but crying won't do any good. [train whistle blowing] There now. Is that better? Oh, George. I'm frightened. I'm scared to death. Life is getting terrible and I don't know what to do. I need you. [crying] Of course you need me. That's what I'm here for. I love you. I know all about Sorel. They also took the man who runs the shop down the street from you, Lorraine and eight other men. One of them worked here in the yard. But nothing can happen for a week. If they find the man who threw the bomb, they'll be released. But that's just it, you don't understand. You see, the man who threw the bomb.. Oh, George, I'm in such an awful situation. I know, dear. The man who threw the bomb is a criminal. If he has any courage, he'll come forward and admit his guilt. Save innocent men. You really believe he's a criminal? Look, Louise, we all hate this occupation. I told Major von Keller to his face that I didn't like it, but we must face facts. They have the power. If one of us wants to resist and get killed that's foolish but courageous. He takes the risk and the punishment himself. But the man who secretly resists with acts of sabotage is a coward. He escapes and innocent people die. - You-you really think that? - It's obvious, darling. You think anyone who resists the enemy ought to give himself up? I think so. But then there's no more resistance. Then we'd have peace. Wouldn't we be better off? Our first duty is to stay alive, to exist. What becomes of a nation if its citizens are all die? But...I saw them take Professor Sorel. - He isn't afraid to die. - Well, he's old, we're young. Life means everything to us. I know young men who aren't afraid to die. Nothing is worth the sacrifice of your life, Louise. We have everything before us. Love, marriage, chi-- No, please, George! I was in love with you. Perhaps I'm still in love with you. 'But I begin to feel as if I never looked at you before.' This is the first time you've ever been frank with me. Oh, my mind's confused. I haven't found the answer yet to the things you've said. But I feel... I know you're wrong. [door opens] Hello, folks. [train chugging in distance] - What's the matter? - Oh, she's just upset. She'll get over it. You know women. [chuckles] I sure don't. [classical music] (Louise) I can't understand what's keeping Paul. He knew you were coming to dinner. Louise...I have something to say to you. Oh, are you worried about something, Albert? Is it your mother? 'Oh, I know she doesn't like me.' - I-I-- - 'Oh, don't apologize.' 'You don't have to explain a thing.' 'She's old and lonely.' 'I understand exactly how you feel.' 'You don't have to stay now, you may go home.' Thank you, Louise. - You forgot something. - It's for you. For me? Why, they're lovely. Where did you get them? Edmund picked them for you. He's very fond of you. Louise.. Lou-Louise, I must speak to you. Louise, I-I know I'm not young. You are so very young in my mind. I remember the day when you graduated. I was already teaching then. And I remember the day, you first came back to teach a class and I was so worried about you. So happy, when I saw how the children loved you. Well, now we're both here together.. ...and we're the only ones left in the school and I feel so very close to you. [explosions] [alarm blaring] [men shouting in German] [sharp whistle blasts] [alarm blaring continues] [sharp whistle blasts] [motorbike revving] [men speaking in German] - Paul! - Lory, sit down at the table. [crockery clattering] [motorbike revving] Understand? I was here for dinner. I've been here an hour. Smoke? [motorbike approaching] Breathe in. [coughing] I don't smoke. [knocking on door] [coughing] Water. Hello, sergeant. What's wrong? What were all those explosions? Ammunition training. - Anyone come in here? - 'No.' Do you live here? What are you doing here then? He's Mr. Lory from next door. He is having dinner with us. Why don't you answer when you're spoken to? I don't smoke. He's a schoolmaster. I gave him his first cigarette. How long have you been here? I-I came home to my mother and then I read the paper. (sergeant) 'What time?' [coughing] Six o'clock. [coughing continues] Who was here? Louise was here. I mean, Miss Martin. And my brother Paul. I'm not asking you. Who was here? He was here. - You're sure about that? - Yes, sir. He was here all the time? Sure. He's sweet on my sister. [sergeant laughing] [speaking in German] You get those men out of my house! Where do you think you are? In Germany? - Please, please, lady! - Don't give me any "please." You get 'em out of my house. I'm a decent law abiding woman, and I don't hide anybody. - I don't hide anybody. - What do you mean? You got no right to go banging about my house. Albert, you come home. Come on. [speaking in German] [clattering] [shouting] My best china! Get out of here, you lummox! Get out! Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am. (Mrs. Lory) 'My wedding gift from the mayor.' [sobbing] (sergeant) Come here. Are you satisfied, lady? No! You're a brute. Hmm. You're all brutes. [rooster crowing] [clock strikes] - Albert. - 'Yes, mother.' [dramatic music] (Mrs. Lory) 'Albert?' Yes, mother? Come and sit down, my darling. You'll be late. They ought to be ashamed to call this coffee. - Morning, mother. - Nothing but burnt corn. You have to stand in line all day to get four ounces of it. I've to see what the mayor has in his table. It's not this, I'm sure. Tsh-aah! That filthy cat! I wish you wouldn't let it in in a window in the morning. It's a very nice cat, mother. Oh, Albert, you'll never grow up. How's your rheumatism this morning, mother? I had to get up in the middle of the night and rub my legs with liniment. I think I must have caught cold sitting up, waiting for you to come home. You know I don't like to be left alone, my darling. I'm sorry, mother. You had tobacco on your breath when you came home from that girl's house. I only took one puff, mother. - I didn't like it. - I hope not. With your weak lungs, tobacco could be the death of you. And I'll always believe that your dear father could have lived much longer if he hadn't smoked. It's poisonous for people with sensitive nerves. Now me.. [knocking on door] I can't stand the smell of tobacco in the house. Now what do you want? Albert Lory? - Oh, what is it you want? - Albert Lory, hostage. Oh. I won't let you do it. But I won't let you take my-- - You don't make trouble now. - He's innocent. He's done nothing. He's innocent. - We have orders to do our duty. - Get out of my house. Don't you touch him. My boy is innocent. If you lay your hands on my son, I'll go to our mayor. He knows my boy's done nothing. Get out, I tell you! [speaking in German] - Where you get this? - Under the door. Albert! He's innocent, let me tell you. Let me tell you! - Mother.. - I want to tell you! [wailing] Albert! [dramatic music] Get out of my way, young man. I want to see Major Von Keller. - He's busy. - I'll wait till he's not busy. - Do you have an appointment? - Tell him it's Mrs. Emma Lory. - I'm a friend of the mayor. - It's no use, madam. Write your name on an application. State the reason for an interview. And I'll let you know in a few days. I'm sorry. The mayor's having a meeting with the council. If he won't see Emma Lory, perhaps he'll see Emma Bellard. Forty years ago, he got slapped for trying to kiss her. I'm sorry. I can't interrupt him. Come back tomorrow. [dramatic music] Sorry, Mrs. Lory, the superintendent is very busy. - He can't see you now. - Can't see me now? Why not? - Now, really, Mrs. Lory. - George Lambert! You listen to me! I'm not going to stand for any more nonsense. Do you know what they've done to my boy? - I'm very sorry-- - Sorry me eye! You're going to do something about it. You sit down. And you listen to me! [piano music] You should go to bed now, Susie, you've practiced enough. Come, kiss papa first. You've not only done your duty, Lambert.. ...you can also expect to be rewarded if Martin's the guilty man. I want no reward, sir. This is very hard for me to do. Between you and me, I hope he is the man. You know my problems, Lambert. I have to handle Von Keller with kid gloves. 'He told me today, he's had orders to increase the shipment' 'of meat and vegetables from this district.' 'Our people are hungry enough as it is.' 'It'll certainly put Von Keller in a good humor' 'if I can deliver the saboteur.' 'Also, I save many lives.' 'Not just Emma Lory's son, but my good friend Sorel.' Sorel's a radical. They won't release him unless Paul tells who threw the bomb. The thing that makes me mad is how he fooled us all. Me, his best friend. Making friends with the Germans. There's one thing I cannot stand, it's hypocrisy. 'And neither can I.' They call me a collaborationist. Very well I am and you know why. It's easy for people in free countries to call us names. You wait and see how they behave when the Germans march in. They'll shake hands, make the best of it. 'If they don't, they'll get the worst of it.' Between you and me, I do my duty, Lambert. I'm mayor of the town and my duty is to defend it. Where can they find this fellow Martin? At home? He's on the night shift tonight. He should be at the switch tower in about half an hour. [dialing] 'Hello, operator.' 'I want to speak to Major Von Keller.' [train chugging] [speaking in German] Anything wrong? Don't ask questions. Go on, do your work. [singing in German] [singing continues] Paul! [speaking in German] - Paul. - Paul! Julie. Julie. [girl laughing] [laughing continues] Why don't you go with a girl like that? Isn't she your type? I know what people say. But you've got to stick by me, Julie. Believe in me. I've tried to, Paul, but this is too much. I hate these soldiers. They killed my brother. Not these fellows, darling. He, uh... he was killed at the front. - Before the armistice-- - I hate you too. - Julie.. - Don't touch me. Don't speak to me. I never want to see you again. [train hooting] [speaking in German] [train chugging] [speaking in German] [train hoots] [train chugging] Hello, George. - Hey, George. - Shh. You're early. Have a smoke. Thanks. Here's a light. Is anything wrong? You know I love Louise, don't you? Sure. You know what it means to me to lose her? - She'll make up again. - I don't think so. - Are you my friend? - Why, sure. - Am I yours? - Say, what is it? If you were in my place.. ...and you knew who did the sabotage, would you tell? - You know who did it, George? - Yes. - And you told-- - Yes. Why did you do it, Paul? Why did you do it, George? Don't look at me like that. You're looking at yourself, George. That's what you can't stand. You can't stand it and that's why you're warning me. Thanks, George. (Julie) 'Paul! Paul!' Paul, I've got to talk to you. Don't move. Stay here. Hold her, George. Paul! Paul! [speaking in German] [train chugging] [train hooting] [speaking in German] [train chugging] [train chugging] [train hooting] [gunshots] Paul! Paul! [clock strikes] [rooster crowing] [exclaiming] Ah! My boy, my boy. Ah, my boy! Let me look at you. I couldn't sleep all night thinking of you in that horrible filthy prison. It was very nice, mother. I saw Professor Sorel. He was in the cell right across from me and we talked all night. When the German soldiers tried to listen, we talked in Latin. [Mrs. Lory chuckling] So, you were having a good time while I was lying awake all night thinking of you. [chuckles] Just like a man. Talk, talk, talk and let the women worry. I'm worried about Prof. Sorel. They didn't release him. I was the only one they let go. Why did they let me go, mother? They're not fools. They know you're needed at the school. Come along, now my darling. Come and have your breakfast. Yes, but Professor Sorel is needed more than I am. Don't let's ask questions. They'll let him out now, you'll see. Come now, have your breakfast, my darling. Oh, I must go and tell Paul and Louise. No! No, no, no! But, mother, I must tell her that I'm free. - It'll make her very happy. - Oh, Albert, don't leave me. - What's the matter, mother? - I don't feel well. And you must shave and change your clothes. You can't go out on the street looking the way you do. Now, look, mother, I've just come through the street. The house is only next door. I shan't be a minute. Hmm. [whistling] Louise? Where's Paul? You coward. 'You know what happened to Paul.' They killed him. That's why you're free. To think we trusted a thing like you. 'I told Paul you'd be strong enough to keep your mouth shut.' How much did they pay you? Or did they just give you your life? - Louise-- - That's not worth much. - Louise! - Don't lie. You're the only one that knew. Get out! Get out! Don't let that girl hurt you. She's mixed up in it too. Just like that brother of hers. He was to blame. - By putting you in prison. - He's dead. And you're free, thank God. You may as well know now, I'm the one who told. Told? Told what? I saw him climb through the window the night you left me alone for that girl. Did you? You? My own mother tell the Germans? I told George Lambert. George Lambert! George Lambert. Albert! He's your friend. George Lambert. [train chugging] 'Good morning, Lambert.' Mmm, I feel poetic this morning. "Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou, Romeo? "Deny thy father and refuse thy name. "Or, if thou wilt not, be but thus sworn my love and I'll no longer be a Capulet." Shakespeare. Great man. We love him in Germany. The English don't understand him. Sit down. You look as if you have indigestion. Or didn't you sleep well last night? Now me...I slept better than I have for weeks. Don't worry, my friend, she'll never know. We keep our secrets. Don't worry about that broken engagement. Now she'll be lonely and make up with you. Too bad he wasn't taken alive. I think somebody warned him. Have you released all the hostages? By no means. Only that fool schoolmaster. After that scare, don't think we'll have any trouble keeping him in line. One for one. Fair trade and good business. Unfortunately, your friend Martin is dead. And dead men can't talk. But I've thought of a way how to find his accomplices. Many people will be afraid to go to the funeral tomorrow. But you will go. You will comfort her. She will admire you for risking my displeasure. And when you take her home she'll want to cry on your shoulder. You see, I'm making up your quarrel for you. She knows who the accomplices were. And you know the way to my office. Do you think I'd do that? I'm sure you will. Oh, excuse me. I have something here for the superintendent. Come in. Come in. We caught it in a trap, up in the loft, sir. I thought maybe you'd like it for your dinner. Hmm, it's a fine fat bird. I wouldn't mind having it at my own table. I'm expecting to hear from you tomorrow night, Lambert. - I hope you like it, sir. - Oh, thanks. [door shuts] [dramatic music] [gunshot] [dramatic music] Murder! 'Murder!' 'Murder!' 'Murder!' Gentlemen of the jury.. ...I can only sum up by saying that the murder has been proved. By the witnesses, by the gun which he was caught holding. And which he admitted he held. By the blood on his handkerchief. And a very clear motive. One of the oldest motives in criminal history. 'Jealousy.' [chuckles] 'You may find it preposterous' 'to believe that a man of his years and timid character' 'could become so enamored, of a young woman as to..' '...commit an act of violence to dispose' 'of a handsome and vigorous rival.' 'Yet I've never seen any man too old' to look at a charming young lady. [chuckles] And I wouldn't give my oath that such glances are always innocent. Gentlemen, all I ask is a just verdict. 'The prosecution rests.' I must agree with the prosecutor. This court regrets that you have refused to be defended by a counsel. You'll have to address the jury from where you sit. 'You'll be allowed all the time you wish.' 'I advise you to speak clearly and to the point.' Thank you, Your Honor. I shall be brief because I have written down all I have to say. I don't understand. I'm sure I had my papers. It's all I've been doing in my cell. All the time, writing it all down. Oh, I see. 'It was only a little hole, but I've been away from home' 'so long, and nobody sewed it up.' 'Well, I hope you'll excuse me for speaking badly.' I've never been able to speak in public. I hope the prosecutor won't think I'm disrespectful to this court and the legal profession in having no lawyer. My only defense is the truth. And nobody could know the truth as well as I do. Because I was there. Well, I was the only one who was there. 'Well, the truth is I wanted to kill George Lambert' 'but I don't think I could have.' 'I'm too weak.' 'I'm a coward.' 'Well, everybody knows it.' 'Even the prosecutor. That's why he's making fun of me.' I'm not a coward here. I have brave dreams. I'm not afraid to commit murder here. But when I face reality...outside.. ...I'm lost...I'm a coward. It's strange. We're two people, all of us. Inside and outside. George Lambert was two men. It wasn't till I saw him dead that I realized it. And I knew why he had killed himself. He couldn't face reality. But he was different from me. He was strong outside.. ...and weak inside. Inside he was a coward. And when this honest coward had to face what that other George, the brave George, had done.. ...he couldn't stand it. So he killed himself. It's strange, but I felt strong for the first time in my life when I saw him dead and I was sorry for him. I suddenly understood everything. Of course, in a way, I was responsible for his death. Through my mother's love for me. 'Even love can be a terrible thing.' 'It can commit crimes.' 'Louise, you thought I informed on Paul.' 'It was my mother.' 'To save me, she told George..' '...and George told the mayor' 'who told Major Von Keller and Paul was killed.' Even Mayor Manville is two men. They both appear to be strong, but they're both weak. 'The outside man has to pretend he's saving the town' 'to hide the inside man who's saving himself.' Your Honor, I object. The accused has no right to seize this occasion to slander our mayor, who's an honorable man. Excuse me, sir. If this is a court of justice, I have a right to be heard. If I'm stopped, how can anyone believe that our civil court to dealing out justice under the occupation 'as the official newspapers insist.' - Proceed. - 'Thank you, sir.' Even before the war, our mayor was convinced that the enemy was not the Germans but a part of our own people. Here's your speech, Lory, we found it in the hall. Thank you. Our mayor was born poor. Then he became powerful. And he began to fear the very people he'd come from. Oh! Our country is full of people like that. Every country is. George Lambert was not powerful but he took the side of the powerful men. He honestly admired them. 'And he found he got on better that way.' Your Honor, I object. It's intolerable. That the accused should exploit the freedom of this courtroom to indulge in dangerous political talk. Maybe these things are political, sir. But they're the basis of my defense. This is a court of justice. Can the accused be permitted to slander the name of his unfortunate victim? Is this a free court or not, sir? If the prisoner insists on this kind of defense I must request permission of the court to call a new witness. - 'Who?' - Mr. Henry Manville. The mayor of the town. He's not present. I'll get him here by the morning. 'I request an adjournment.' Has the accused any objection? Not at all, sir. (judge) 'Very well.' 'This session stands adjourned.' [murmuring] [clock strikes] [clattering] Good evening, Lory. I heard about that torn pocket. You lost your speech. But you did alright from all accounts. May I sit down? Please, of course. Sit down. Lory, I was mistaken about you. 'You're a man of real courage.' Oh, no. Oh, no, I'm not. I know what you said in court, but you're wrong. I know more about you than you do yourself. I was a fool not to realize it sooner. - Cigarette? - 'No, thank you.' This is my second one. Lory, I like you. Too bad, you made a great mistake in court today. You called yourself a coward but you disproved it by what you said. Now they know you killed Lambert. But I didn't. Now, come, come, I'm not trying to convict you. I'm here to save you, I'm your friend. I told the truth. I didn't. Lory, I believe you. Now I remember the way Lambert looked when I left him. Why, that's incredible. Well, that makes it all very easy. Lambert was despondent because of losing Miss Martin. The police will find the suicide note. We can handle the jury and you'll be acquitted. Oh. 'You won't have to say another word in court.' Oh. [sighing] Oh. Did they find a suicide note? You're a poet, Lory, a poet. 'I don't understand why you're trying to save my life.' I told you. I like you. Oh, I see. You don't want me to say anything more in court. My dear, Lory, it's a peculiar situation. A courtroom is a public forum. Of course, we Germans could take over courts schools, town halls the administration of the whole country. But we are not tyrants, we prefer not to do that. 'We prefer to collaborate, to give freedom to the nations' 'that we defeat on the battlefield.' 'But freedom must be limited by the necessities of war.' 'We're still fighting another France.' 'Now, it's a very small sacrifice we ask of you' 'when we are still sacrificing our lives' 'for the future happiness of the world.' 'You see, I'm frank, I have nothing to conceal.' 'I tell you these things because you're a man of intelligence.' 'Lambert was just a tool.' 'Very honest, but not very bright.' 'The mayor, you were right in the court room..' '...he's working for his own interest.' But we need them. And we find them in every country we invade. Why, even in Germany we used them. That's the way our party got into power. They're everywhere. And that's why nothing can stop us from winning the world. America feels secure because of our oceans. They think of invasion in terms of armies and airplanes. But they are already invaded. The honest Lamberts and the dishonest Manvilles are waiting to welcome us, just as they did here in Europe. And if any time we need peace.. If peace should be a further weapon of conquest their sincere patriotism will find plenty of arguments for the peace. After all, what is the United States? A charming cocktail of Irish and Jews. Very spectacular, but very childish. And England? A few old ladies wearing their grandfather's leather breeches. [Lory chuckling] Well, Lory? 'What do you say?' [sighs] Could I have another light for my cigarette? - 'Oh, certainly.' - Thank you. Lory, I'm glad you've decided to live and be a free man. You're a schoolmaster. And you have a great duty, the regeneration of the youth. You must make them ready for the world of tomorrow. And believe me, it will be a fine world. [marching footsteps] [soldier speaking in German] [speaking in German] Professor Sorel! 'Professor Sorel!' [soldier speaking in German] [guns clicking] Professor Sorel! [gunshots] [murmuring] [bell ringing] You may call your witness, Mr. Prosecutor. If it'd please the court it will not be necessary to call Mayor Manville. For the cause of justice, new evidence has been found 'which will make unnecessary the continuation of this trial.' What evidence? Why hasn't the court been informed of this? I only found it this morning, Your Honor. Among some mail which I'd forgotten to open. It's in the handwriting of the deceased George Lambert's. And was mailed at the railroad station shortly before his death. I offer it in evidence. It saves us from a grave miscarriage of justice. Because it shows clearly that the deceased George Lambert intended suicide. Uh, excuse me, Your Honor, it's a forgery. 'I know all about that letter' 'but I didn't know it was gonna be mailed to the prosecutor.' Quiet, you fool. Just one moment, Mr. Prosecutor. What do you mean? The letter's forged, Your Honor. Major Von Keller told me last night. He's out of his mind, the man's insane. No, Your Honor, I'm not insane. Prosecutor wrote that letter to himself. I think he's trying to save my life. [audience laughing] [bell ringing] This is no laughing matter. Your Honor, for the sake of dignity of this court I respectfully ask, the man who started that unseemly outburst be forcibly removed from the room. The court agrees with you, Mr. Prosecutor. Which of you started that laughter? Please, stand up. 'I ask you again, who started that laughter?' Excuse me, Your Honor. I don't know, but I think I can guess. Maybe it was the unknown soldier. - Proceed, Mr. Lory. - 'Thank you, sir.' I found out last night that I'm a very lucky man. This is the only place left in my country where a man can still speak out, standing where I stand now. Excuse me, Your Honor, I ask the courtroom be cleared. He's afraid, Your Honor. He wants to deprive me of my last chance to speak. I know I'm a condemned man. I know I must die. Are you going to let me speak, Your Honor? 'Or are you afraid, too?' (prosecutor) 'I demand that the courtroom be cleared.' Proceed, Mr. Lory. Thank you. Thank you, sir. I'm a very lucky man. Last night, I had a moment of weakness, so I wanted to live. I had very good reasons to live. Major Von Keller told me beautiful things about the future of this world they're building. I almost believed him. But it's very hard for people like you and me to understand what is evil and what is good. It's easy for the working people to understand who the enemy is because the aim of this invasion and this occupation is to make them slaves. But middle class people like us can easily believe as George Lambert did that a German victory is not such a bad thing. We hear people say that too much liberty brings chaos and disorder. And that's why I was tempted last night by Major Von Keller when he came to my cell, but this morning, I looked out through bars and I saw this beautiful new world working. I saw ten men die because they still believed in freedom. Among them was a man I loved, Professor Sorel. He smiled and waved at me as if he were telling me what to do. I knew then I had to die. And the strange thing is, I was happy. Your Honor, I demand an adjournment. I object to this insane talk. Quiet, please. Those ten men died because of Paul Martin. 'But they didn't blame Paul Martin' 'they were proud of him.' 'Paul was a soldier.' 'Without glory, but in a wonderful cause.' 'I see now that sabotage is the only weapon' left to a defeated people. 'And so long as we have saboteurs' 'the other free nations who are still fighting' 'on the battle fronts will know that we are not defeated.' Oh, I know, that for every German killed many of our innocent citizens are executed. But the example of their heroism is contagious and our resistance grows. Oh, it's very easy to talk about heroism in the free countries. But it's hard to talk about it here where our people are starving. The hard truth is.. ...the hungrier we get, the more we need our heroes. We must stop saying that sabotage is wrong that it doesn't pay. It does pay. It makes us suffer, starve and die. But though it increases our misery it will shorten our slavery. That's a hard choice. I know. But even now they are bringing more troops into town because of the trouble that has started. And the more German soldiers there are here the less they have on the fighting fronts. 'Even an occupied town like this' 'can be a fighting front, too.' 'And the fighting is harder.' 'We not only have to fight hunger' 'and a tyrant.' First, we have to fight ourselves. 'The occupation' 'any occupation in any land' 'is only possible' 'because we are corrupt.' 'And I accuse myself first.' 'For my own competent security' 'I made no protest against the mutilation' 'of the truth in our school books.' 'My mother got me extra food and milk' 'and I accepted it without facing the fact' 'that I was depriving children' 'and people poorer than we were of their portion.' 'Now ,you're the butcher, Mr. Noble.' 'Naturally, you wanted to survive' 'and the black market was your answer.' 'You keep your business going by selling meat' 'out the back door at ten times its price.' 'Some to my mother, who is equally guilty' 'as I was in eating it.' 'You, Mr. Millett, are doing very well in your hotel' 'even although it's filled with Germans' 'you've never sold so much champagne' 'and at such a good price.' 'Of course, they print the money for nothing.' 'But with this money' 'you are buying property.' Just as the mayor is I could say the same about many of you. 'If the occupation lasts long enough' 'the men who are taking advantage of it' 'will own the town.' I don't blame you for making money. But you should blame yourselves for making the occupation possible. Because you cannot do these things without playing into the hands of the real rulers of the town, the Germans! 'That's why I know you must condemn me to die' 'not because I killed George Lambert, which I didn't.' 'But because I've tried to tell the truth.' 'And the truth can't be allowed to live under the occupation.' 'It's too dangerous.' 'The occupation lives upon lies' 'as the whole evil world' 'they call the new order does.' 'Officially, you'll find me guilty of murder.' 'But, don't worry, my friends, even if you were to acquit me' 'and I would walk out of this court a free man' 'the enemy would put me up against a wall, and you too.' 'They can find any reason to take hostages.' 'Oh, there's one final charge I must answer to.' And I'm very guilty. Yesterday, I was ashamed when the prosecutor accused me of loving you, Louise. 'I've always loved you secretly.' 'But now, I'm not ashamed. I'm proud of it.' 'I don't want to keep it a secret.' 'I want to tell the whole world.' 'I don't feel silly at all.' 'Maybe it's because I'm going to die.' 'But I feel very young.' 'You know..' 'Major von Keller said a very funny thing to me last night.' 'He told me I wasn't a coward.' 'I think he was right.' 'And I'm not the only one who's not a coward.' 'This town is full of courage.' 'I'm proud of it.' I'm proud to be born and die here. Thank you, Your Honor. Gentlemen of the jury, you will now retire from this courtroom to exercise your free conscience and arrive at a just verdict. We have already agreed on a verdict, Your Honor. Albert Lory, please stand. What is your verdict? We, the jury, by unanimous agreement fully conscious of our responsibility in weighing the guilt or innocence of the accused who has been here tried for the murder of George Lambert find him not guilty. [crowd cheering] [bell tolling] Thank you, young men. Sit down. I'm afraid this is my last class. I don't know how much time I have. If this must be a short lesson I think I've found the best book. It was given to me by Professor Sorel. The only reason it wasn't burnt with the others is because I hid it away in my bedroom. I'm going to read you something that was written by great men. Written in a night of enthusiasm a long time ago, a 150 years ago. These men came from all classes rich people, poor people, businessmen, men of religion. And they didn't fight with each other. They all agreed on that wonderful night. Now other men are trying to destroy this book. Maybe this copy will be burned but they can't burn it out of your memories. You'll have to rewrite it someday. That's why you young people are so important. You're the new nation. "A Declaration Of The Rights Of Man. "Article one. "All men are born and remain free "and equal in rights. "Article two. "The purpose of all political parties is the safeguarding "of the natural and inalienable rights of man. "These rights are liberty, property security "and resistance to tyranny. '"Article three.' '"The principle of all government' '"resides in the nation itself.' "No group, no individual can exercise any authority "that does not expressly emanate from the people. '"Article four.' "Liberty consists in freedom to do all "that does not harm others. "Article five. "The law has the right to forbid.." [door opening] Just one moment, gentlemen, please. "The law has the right to forbid only those things which are harmful to society." Well, I must go. I must go not because I'm harmful to society which is you because I am harmful to tyranny. Come on. Don't move, don't move, Louise.. ...and don't cry. I'm happy. That's enough. Come on. Goodbye...citizens. Sit down. "Article six. "The law is the expression of the will of the people." "All citizens have "the right to assist personally "or through their elected representatives "in its formation. "It ought to be the same for all "whether it protects or whether it punishes. "All citizens, being equal in eyes of the law "have equal rights to all dignities "places in public positions "according to their capacity and without any other distinctions than those of their virtues and talents."
