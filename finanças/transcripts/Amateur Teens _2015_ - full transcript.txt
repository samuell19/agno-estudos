A Tragedy in Five Acts Hey! Give it back. Sabrina? Do you like her, or something? Are you crazy! Isn’t she the girl from 2a, the one who’s hooking up with Roger? Who says that? Roger. You can go after her anyway. Free market economy! Go on, friend her. Are you crazy! I don’t even know her. Cut the crap, man! Just move your ass, man, otherwise you’ll be a virgin for ever. Now you have to stick to it, bro. You really are a bunch of assholes. Good morning, sit down please. The average was around 80%, right around a B+. It’s an achievement not only for you but also for me. Zeqir, well done. Luca, bravo. Ask your parents to sign this. Are you Lara Burri? I took the wrong bus. Well, then you learned a little geography. That’s good too. My name is Susann Kaltenbrunner, I’m the counselor here. I talked to your mom. She told me about the difficult situation at home. Just that you know: If there is anything, anything at all... You can always come to me. I found her. Hi Madeleine. Hello Lara, I’m Mrs. Elsener. Come in. You heard it. This is Lara, your new classmate. Please give her a warm welcome. You can take the desk over there. Let’s carry on with the next sentence: “The parrot does not repeat everything you say.” Milena? Le... le coq... No, not the rooster, the parrot. Le perroquet? Yes, “le perroquet”. Le perroquet ne répète pas... que je lui dirais?? This sentences is totally useless. I would never say this in France. Well then compose a sentence you would use in France. Your parents will go berserk, when they see you got another bad grade. No way I’m gonna tell them. Are you gonna forge their signatures again? What else can I do? I can’t concentrate. You have to much pressure. Nobody can concentrate with all this pressure. Just imagine that you get a blowjob for every good grade. What, from Buchi? No, not Buchi. From Summer Nyte, for example. Who’s that? Summer Nyte is the world record holder in giving head. 249 guys in 14 hours. What?! April 2005. Too bad our chicks aren’t like this. Yeah, totally. Are you coming to the mall? I want to check out the latest Fifa game. For sure. And then we can go to McDonalds. Totally. I can’t, my dad’s working late. Man, just tell him you can’t always ditch your bros. Tell him yourself. Did you do your homework? Yes. Show me. Why? Because father wants me to check. Later. Now. I kissed Lilly today. What?? At school. And what did she do? She screamed and ran away. You can’t just walk up and kiss her. Why not? Dumbass! That must be totally uncomfortable. Totally. But you’d have to take them off, to get your pants off. Well, you put them back on. Here you are! What are you talking about? We were wondering why women keep their shoes on in pornos. And why they let guys come on their face. I just got a text with an ad for porn. Maybe we’ll be into that once we’re older. It’s the same with cigarettes: At first it’s totally gross... but after a while you kind of dig it. Bullshit! Speaking of: can I have a smoke? Yes, but if Meili catches you, it wasn’t me. That old fart better give me back my cell. What? Did he just take your cell? Yeah, and now my mom has to leave work to get it. Check out the new girl over there. She’s so weird... You don’t even know her. Let’s check her out. What’s her last name? Burri. See! She only has 42 friends on Facebook. She’s so lame! She’s totally antisocial. Hi girls. – Hi Milena. – Hello Mrs. Hofer. Was it bad? He has a stomach ulcer. Oh no... What do we do now? The vet says he could have surgery. It’d cost CHF 600. Thank goodness, right Benji. He should only eat dry food until surgery. Alright. Can Milena sleep over tonight? Did you ask your mom? I’m sure she’ll be ok with it. So she doesn’t have to cook. Well then... okay. We’re going upstairs. You know what I did yesterday? I signed up for an online chat. Seriously? It’s totally awesome. I had 12 friend requests within one hour. What gave you the idea to do this? My cousin told me about it. She met her boyfriend like that. Did you chat with one of them? Yes, with one guy. Until one in the morning. Do you want to see him? Look, it’s him. He looks really good. Right? Like a model. A bit old, maybe. It’s alright, he’s 23. Does he know that you’re only 14? No, I had to say I was 18. Otherwise I couldn’t sign up. Do you want something with him? I don’t know... I don’t think so. What do you think about Selim? He friended me on Facebook, yesterday. Selim...? Right, the one who hangs out with Jan and Adi. They’re so immature. I think he’s kind of sweet. But boring, like all the guys at our school. Okay, easy on the legs. Three straight punches, dive and a hook with your lead hand. Okay, go. One, two, three... Faster... And stop! We’re not done talking, kiddo. – Hi. – Hi there, I finished early. I thought I could come pick you up. Cool, thank you. How was training? Are you ready for qualifying round? We’ll see... Mom’s coming home late. Do you want to grab a bite somewhere? Do you also think that I have an impulse control problem? What? Who said that? My coach. He said I was too aggressive when going into a fight. Isn’t that good? What’s the problem? Apparently I’m not capable... of adapting myself to my opponent. He said, if I don’t get a grip on it, I'll get into serious trouble some day. Trouble?! That’s just the way you are. I wasn’t any different at your age. So what did you do? I got older. You’ll outgrow it, you’ll see. Right, I’m hungry. Wanna grab some Sushi? We could ask Lara if she wants to come shopping after school. I don’t think so. Did somebody see my towel? It seriously reeked, I threw it in the trash. I could give you the name of a hairdresser. Unless you want to be elected “Miss Taliban”. I mean, I don’t care. But this is just too much for any guy. Aren’t you being a little harsh? What?! I just want to save her from herself. She’s just so frigid. I’ll wait outside. Hey Lara... Don’t take it to heart. Milena can be a little crazy at times. Hey. Hi. Thank you for inviting me to the movies. I’m happy you came. Is it true that you don’t drink, smoke or take any drugs? Why? Who says that? Fatima. Because you’re a Muslim. I just think it’s stupid to drink just to get wasted. Me too. Do you also go to the mosque sometimes? Only when we’re visiting my granddad in Turkey. He’s the Imam in his village. I’m sure it’s super nice there. Yeah, totally. Actually... why did you ask me out? Because I like it that you're honest. I can see that in your pictures. Everybody wants to be something else online. Seem cooler or more beautiful. But you are just like I see you in school. Are you still seeing Roger? I broke up with him two weeks ago. Are you sad? No, I’m happy. Can you help me make a snail? Do you want me to help you? Do all of you want to make a snail? First, we need the body. I’m going to make a huge one. Are you making a big snail? And then we make his little house. Did you do this already? And now, what else do we need? These? Antenna. Exactly! Let’s make blue ones. Potty. Do you have to go potty? Come with me. Hi Milena, Sarah’s mom just called. She told me how much Sarah loves coming to daycare when you’re around. She’s a sweetheart! She asked if you want to babysit Sarah sometime. Sure, I’d love to. I’ll give her your phone number, okay? Yes, great. Just tell me when you’re done. Hi Milena, can I? Hi. What’s up? Nothing, internship. Shit, I have to deal with that crap too. Where are you? At daycare, infant educator. Must be easy with the little ones. Kind of... But sometimes you have to be careful to keep everything under control. I can imagine. Wanna hang out sometime? What do you mean? – Do you know the “Club Dive”? – You have to be 16 to get in. Yes, but I know the bouncer. – I don’t think so. – I do, he goes to the same gym. I didn’t mean that. Oh, right... Why? Do you have a boyfriend? No. Then you should come anyway. Maybe you’ll like it. Sorry, but you’re just not my type. I mean, we don’t have to make out right away. Excuse me?? I mean, I’m cool if we don’t fuck right away. You really don’t get it! I would never have sex with a guy like you. You’re far too immature. I use “d prime” to calculate “r”. What does “d prime” have to do with the radius? You don’t even know how long “d prime” is. But I could use the Pythagoras... The Pythagoras?! Is this a right angle triangle? Aren’t all triangles in a circle right angle? Only when the hypotenuse is equal to the diameter. – Didn’t Mr. Buchi explain this? – Sort of... You see! So why do you always make excuses. I could draw over this line... “Draw over?” Do you know how much your parents pay for these private lessons? And you have nothing else to say than “I thought” or “I don’t know”? I’m sorry. Don’t apologize to me. One more bad grade and you’ll be held back. Did Buchi say that? No, but you could figure it out yourself: You also have bad grades in French and German. What can I do? Use your brain for once and pay attention. Let’s do it again: How do you calculate the radius? ...if I take the train right after school, I could be at your place around four. Why not? I could tell mom that I went to see a friend. It really stinks that the Guardianship Office decides that. No, not at all. The people at school are all morons. You too, take care. Bye dad. Aren’t we at the same school? Aren’t you the “Taliban Girl”? How cool is that! I thought you need the landing flap to slow down. No, you use the thrust reversal to brake. You only use the landing flap to generate more lift. Namely for take off. I can show it to you on the simulator if you want. Do you think that soon all airplanes will be navigated from the ground? Like drones? That would really suck. You only want to be a pilot because of the flight attendants. Right? Speaking of which, how was your date with Sabrina? Good, why? No reason. I think she kind of likes me. Did you fuck? Are you crazy! So you just went home after the movies? Yeah, so? So how do you know she likes you? I can feel it. Why are you laughing like an idiot? We’re just worried about our little virgin. You’re a virgin yourself. No, I’m not. You know that. Are you talking about the blowjob that Italian hooker gave you on vacation? She’s no hooker. She’s an ex-model. I thought she was a fat Mamma. Who cares. The point is, I had sex. A blowjob is not sex. – I agree. – Dude, it’s called “oral sex”! Fucking is having sex, dick in pussy. Whatever. Still: you’ll only know if a girl wants you if you fuck her. That’s bullshit. – Wanna bet? – I don’t bet! – Hello Mrs. Kaltenbrunner. – Hi Selim, come in. Never mind, forget it. You must have had a reason why you wanted an appointment. Yes, but... Come on, sit down. Do you want some tea? I’m totally confused. Why? Because of Sabrina. Sabrina Hofer? She’s sweet. I think I’m in love. But that’s nice, isn’t it? No, I’m freaked out! Why are you freaked out? I don’t know what to do next. Even though I think she likes me. Do you really have to do something? What do you want exactly? I don’t know... Have sex with her. Did you tell her that? Certainly not. Why not? I’m not used to talking about things like that. Maybe she thinks like you. And you have no reason to be nervous. I’m sure she already did it. At least with one guy. If she already did it, she knows that the first time is always nerve-wracking. You have nothing to be ashamed about. Just wait and see how it goes. You don’t think she’ll think I’m a loser? No, absolutely not. On the contrary, girls prefer it... when these things go slowly. Hi Sabrina. Hey. Thank you for sticking up for me in the locker room. Sure. These are my favorite. They’re really good. My mom used to pack them for me when we went on a school trip. – Really? Mine too! – That's crazy! Do you want to hang out sometime? – Hey Lara. – Hi Lara. We have to tell you something really important. Come with us. What, right now? Yes, come on. Wait a second. What is it? Nothing. We just wanted to save you from her. Milena is so right. She’s, like, totally frigid. Did you see her clothes? I’m a good student,... I’m interested in a lot of things,... I’m always on time... And, maybe, that I’m honest. Why “maybe”? What do you mean? That it’s maybe your strength? Or that you’re not always honest? No, it’s my strength. Right, tell me something about yourself. Do you mean my hobbies and stuff? Yes, for example. Well... I like reading,... chatting, snowboarding,... Why should you be our apprentice? How do you think this interview is going? Not very well, maybe? Why not? I’ll tell you why: The things you’re telling me aren’t helping me to get to know you. I’m not getting you. I don’t know who you are. He’s such a moron. I was destroyed afterwards. When I left the interview, I wanted to throw myself in front of a car. Why did you apply for that job in the first place? My dad says an insurance company is always a good choice. Maybe he's right. Maybe I’m totally boring. If you were boring, you’d have gotten the job. Because it’s a totally boring industry. You’re so sweet. Why don’t you try the entrance exams for high school? You have good grades. I don’t know if it’s the right thing for me. Why not? My friends say that you go to school for ages... and when you graduate, you’re 20 and you still have nothing. What does your gut tell you? It could be cool... I always wanted to be a vet when I was little. Hi. There's nothing up there. What do you care? I’m just saying that... you can’t go up there ‘cause it’s locked. Sure I can. This is your floor. I wanna see this! Who gave you the code? You really don’t get it: We live at Riedbach Street 175, and our block has four houses. On every top floor there is a lock with a four-digit code. If you were the super, which code would you use? That’s fucking awesome! Wow... that's badass! Are you crazy? Do you wanna get killed? This is awesome... Come on! Close your eyes. Do you do this a lot? My old house was only five stories high,... it wasn’t the same. What? My bros will never believe this. I don't get it, why are the other girls so mean to you? I wouldn’t put up with that. I would seriously put them in their place. How? Dunno. You could steal some sulfuric acid from the lab... and put it on their towels. Imagine how awesome it would be when they dry their faces with it. Seriously, you have to do something. They don’t even know you. – Hi, I’m Lars. – Hey. You’re even prettier in person than on your profile. Hop in. You did all this? Recorded it yesterday. It’s real good! Shit, sorry. Am I interrupting something? That’s Dan, my housemate. This is Milena. Hi Milena. Hi. Maybe you know him. He’s the resident DJ at Fivepoint. Every Thursday – Drum ‘n Bass. I bought tons of food. Are you hungry? Sure. I could make some spaghetti. What?! You had sex with two guys at once? – Like, totally had sex? – Yes, I totally had sex. It was awesome. First, we ate spaghetti, then Dan started to dance,... Then we danced too... And then it just, like, happened. You didn’t know these guys before? First, it was kind of strange, but then I thought: Who cares and I let them. I swear, when two guys are in to you at the same time... it’s just totally awesome! Did you blow one? – Sure. – You really aren’t scared of anything! No guts, no glory! I don’t think I’d like that. I wonder if I’d like it. Didn’t you feel awkward afterwards? Sabrina, you’re seriously getting on my nerves. Excuse me? Every time something crazy happens, you’re, like, totally judgmental. Sometimes you’re really boring, almost frigid. I didn’t say it was stupid. But you thought it. I can see that. Come on, stop the drama! Cigarette? Can I help? No, I’m almost done. Are you bored? Mom’s coming home soon. We’ll eat then. I really don’t want to do my homework. It was the same for me at the office. But sometimes you have to get your shit together... and just do what you have to do. You’ll see, you’ll be happy when it’s done. Gangbang is so out. Out?! No one jerks off with gangbang anymore. It’s one of the most popular categories. Maybe for homos. I prefer one man and several girls. FFM is better. Or Gonzo. Amateur Teens. Amateur Teens doesn’t do it for me anymore. Then you’re desensitized. Maybe you should jerk off to Softcore. Hilarious... But that’s not the point. What is it then? There are millions of people uploading their videos on Youporn. What’s your point? Where are all those women who love having sex? Not at our school, that’s for sure. What are you talking about? Adi says that every woman is secretly a slut. But they don’t want to admit it. I know where all the women are who like sex. My cousin goes to these sex-parties. What, swinger-clubs? No, private parties. They're always at another venue. You just have to be on their e-mail list. That’s awesome! How much does it cost? I think a hundred bucks. I can ask him when the next one will happen. Guys, let’s do it! Count me in! Are you coming too? No need, thanks. Oho! No need! He’s hanging out with Sabrina now. Seriously? With sex and all that? No, that’s the problem. I tell you, if you want a good fuck, come with us. You don’t even know if she really likes you. I think she might like him. Wanna bet that Selim won’t lock it down with her. You really are a bunch of morons. – Hey, where are you going? – Is he pissed off, or what? Dude, was that really necessary? What’s your problem? He took it personally. So what? Bros before hoes. You must be Selim. Hello Mrs. Hofer. Sabrina is in the kitchen. Just go on in. I’m nearly done. Hey cutie. That’s Benji. Where did you get him from? From a magician. I swear. My parents got a magician for my 10th birthday. He pulled him out of his hat and gave him to me. Right, Benji? But I don’t know how much longer he has to live. He has a stomach ulcer. Can’t he have surgery? Yes, he could. But my dad doesn’t want it. He says it’s too much. Let’s go to your room. Are you sure we’re at the right place? I thinks it’s over there on the right. Dude, you said that 10 minutes ago. Show me the newsletter. Take it. Kalchbuhl Street 367... That’s what I said. Guys, listen: “An unforgetable party and the hottest girls await you.” “Let your wildest phantasies run free.” This is going to be awesome! Do we have to pay extra for the girls? No, they say it’s included in the price. What kind of women are they? The one my cousin screwed was a 30-year-old dental assistant. Married, but her old man isn’t up for sex anymore. How can someone not wanna fuck anymore? Selim will be so pissed when we tell him. Dude, your cousin is so cool! Check out those legs! Let's go! Are you guys looking for something? Yeah, we wanna go to the party. We’re on the list. It’s not for minors. You have to be at least 18. It didn't say that in the newsletter. You can’t do this to us! We even took the train to come out here! I’m sorry, guys. Come on, can’t you make an exception? We can pay a little extra, if you want. Listen, guys... I’ll get into serious trouble if I let you in. Come on! Where else could we go? The hookers won't take us, that’s for sure. I know, guys. One thing’s for sure,... there’s no place in this town where kids like you can get laid. You must feel real important now. I bet you’re too stupid to breathe. And your little beard looks as if a cunt was stuck to your face. – Easy. – I won’t put up with this. Let us in, right now! I’m going to give you a piece of advice: fuck off or I’ll kick the shit out of you. Go on! Do it! If you don’t leave, I’m calling the cops. Come on, let’s go. He’s such a douchebag! – Do you like it? – Not bad. Do you like this one? It’s nice. Do you want it? I think Selim might like it too. He seems really nice. I forgot the ticket. I’ll be back in a sec. Can I ask you something? Sure. What was your first time like? I hope you used protection. Sure. But? Nothing. Forget it. What about your private lessons? They’re shit. That guy is even worse than Buchi. Are you kidding? He treats me like I’m an idiot. You really think you’ll pass the exam if you take Speed? I have no choice. I would be so pissed if I got held back. I’d be in the same class as Simon and Valentin. That sucks. So, you see what I mean? Aren’t you scared to fuck up? Why should I? People have their most genius ideas on drugs. You’re only saying that because you think you have no other choice. Steve Jobs, for example. He said he had his best ideas while he was high. And Bill Gates too. Imagine what these anti-drug politicians would do if you'd take their iPhones... they would fucking freak out! How does this shit even work? I don’t know... Apparently you’re, like, really sharp and totally alert. I think I’ll get some too. Why? You don’t have bad grades. Dude, so we can party! He said he was waiting on the basketball court. They don’t look like dealers. The one with the hoodie. Let’s go there. How do you know this guy? I found him on the Internet. Yeah, I’m sorry, but I’m really busy right now. Where am I...? In the city. Yeah, I had a great time, but... I don’t know. No, it’s not because of Dan. To be honest, I think we shouldn’t see each other anymore. And please stop calling me. There you are. I was looking for you. Are you alright? Let’s go outside. What’s going on? Close the door. I don’t want Selim to see me. I thought you liked him. Was he just messing with you? But something must have happened. He was at my house Saturday. And it was really weird. When we made out,... I put my hand in his shorts. And when I touched it... he came right away. In your hand or what!? It isn’t funny! Oh my god... ...and then what happened? It was, like, so embarrassing. I didn’t know what to do. He got dressed and just ran out. If I see him now... What do I say? Are you in love with him? But I have the feeling I did something wrong. You didn’t do anything wrong. It's okay... It’s not that bad. Just call him, you’ll see. Time to start wrapping it up. You have 5 minutes left. I’m sorry I just ran out. Can we still see each other? Dude, how awesome would it be if we won the Champions League. Totally, against Bayern-Munich. Three to one! Then we should get off from school! But first we have to beat Inter Milan. I think FC Zurich has a chance. Dude, Inter Milan beat Liverpool. They’re really strong right now. And Yapi Yapo is missing. We’ll party anyway. Aren’t your parents going to freak out if we hang out on a schoolnight? My parents aren’t home. We can even drink my dad's alcohol. Dave and Kemal are coming too. My condolences. Why? Because you fucked it up with Sabrina. – I didn’t fuck it up. – What did you fuck up? Dave says you did. Can someone fill me in! Here’s the deal: Dave is in a group chat with Milena. And she wrote to Fatima that Selim came before they even really got going. Now your rep is fucked up for sure. Hey, this affects all of us. This loser-status will rub off on us too. Hi. Wanna go up to the roof? Now? I have to run. I’m meeting the guys. Maybe another time. Wanna take these? You could come too. We’ll watch the game at Adi’s house. If your friends don’t mind you showing up with the “Taliban Girl”. As if it mattered. Granddad called, he wanted to know... if we’re coming this summer. He wanted to know how you were doing. What do you want? To say that I’m sorry. Come watch the game with us. Otherwise I’m not going. Do you want me to kick your ass? Go on, hit me. Dude, come on, we’re friends. That’s what really matters. Tell dad I’m at Adi’s. What’s it? Sabrina just called. Call her back and tell her she’s a bitch for telling everyone. What an opportunity for Bonazzoli! Lots of pressure on Da Costa's goal... in those last moments! Only seconds remain to level! You can hear the Milanese howling. Finally... Chermiti rocks big time! I told you he’d score! Guys! Time to get wasted! Awesome, man! – Come on, fill ‘em up. – Your dad has some pretty great stuff. To us, the FCZ and the entire world! Hold on a sec... What now? We’ve earned it. What’s that? Something to get high! What does it do? Don’t be a pussy. Just take it! One, two, three! – Dude, just pound it! – Take it, bro! Come on, drink it. The second round is to you. Second round! Listen, guys. Shit! Hi, how are you? Guys, shut up for a sec. Sure, tell me. Wait... I found it. The booking reference is... ...1-1-2-4-7-6-3-0. We just watched the game. Awesome, right! With the guys... and Lara. No, she’s new at school. No, dad, we won’t drink too much. No, we won’t do anything stupid. Girls, listen what Adi just texted me! They had a gangbang with Lara. What?! Apparently they watched porn after the game... and then she had sex with them. Lara?! Five guys at once. That’s badass! I’m sure it’s not true. Adi is just playing it up. You can ask Jan, he was there too. Who else was there? Dave, Kemal and Selim. Maybe Lara isn’t as frigid as we thought. Fuck, I’m so hung over! I thought you’d skip class. Hey, you can bring Lara anytime to watch a game. That was awesome, right? Where’s Selim? Maybe he feels bad because of Sabrina. At least he’s not a virgin anymore. Sit down. I’m very disappointed. More than half of the class failed. I don’t know what you guys were thinking. Certainly not about geometry. However,... we have one positive exception. Sweet! B+! Good morning Selim. What are you doing here so early? I really need to talk to you. I have a meeting. We raped a girl. There was this scene on Youporn where a woman had sex with five men. Lara and Jan started to make out. First, I didn’t get what was going on, because I was so high from those drugs. But Adi was really turned on. Eventually he put his hand between her legs. Lara let it happen. I think she didn’t realise it was Adi’s hand. Because when she realised it was his hand,... she pushed it away. Adi was like: “I don’t get it, why you’re being so uptight.” Lara got up... and wanted to leave. Jan was pissed off. He said she couldn’t hang him out to dry... after turning him on like that. Adi tried to calm her down. He said it was a compliment that everyone wants her. And that he didn’t understand what game she was playing. Dave said the game is called: “Catch me, I’m a little bunny.” He jumped off the sofa and howled like a wolf. Then they dragged her to the sofa... Dave held her down and said: “Come on, pull down the bunny's fur.” She fought back and screamed... Adi said: “It’s ok, she’s just pretending, she’s totally into it.” Then they pulled down her skirt and her panties. And then he just penetrated her... until she stopped fighting back. Then it was Dave’s turn, then Jan... and then... Adi said: “Come on Selim, it’s your turn. You can finally fuck.” Guys, look, it’s Lara. Hey Lara, let’s have a party too. Can I borrow your red lipstick? Take the Baby-Lips, the other one smudges. I wonder how it feels to be in a gangbang? I don’t know if I would have the guts to do it. Did you see Milena’s face when she heard about Lara? She was so pissed off. I think it’s kind of awesome how Lara put Milena in her place. She always thinks that everybody wants only her. “Oh my god, it’s, like, so awesome... when two guys want you at once.” Yeah, totally. Now she can fuck off with her three-way. Wanna go shopping after school? Sure, why not. We could ask Lara if she wants to join us. Totally. How did you do in biology yesterday? Lara, I called you out of French class. Let’s go to my office. I want you to know... that everything we discuss in here... will not leave this room until we know what the next steps are. Do you understand? Selim told me that you were at Adi’s with Jan, Dave and Kemal. And that they forced you to have sex with them. Is this true? So, it wasn’t like that? Lara, I don’t understand what you mean. Is what Selim said true? Yes, kind of... But nobody forced me. Lara, am I understanding you correctly: You consented to have intercourse with these five boys? Yes. I don’t think it’s illegal. But Lara, I can see that something is bothering you... If what I’m doing in my free time isn’t illegal... it doesn’t concern you or the school or anybody else. Why don’t we learn that at school? How all these things work... why feelings can hurt so much. I don’t get why he did this. Guys think with their dicks. That’s it. I thought Selim was different. I don’t get it! How can they be so turned on by Lara? I think I’ll do a gangbang too. I bet it’s awesome. I mean, it was already totally crazy with two guys. But imagine with five... or even ten. Don’t you think? I’m so sick of this bullshit. Hey, what’s your problem? What do you want? The counselor said you participated voluntarily. Didn’t you like it? “Catch me, I’m a little bunny.” Why are you doing this? Lara, who’s at the door? I give you a good piece of advice: Next time, just stay at home. A gangbang is not for babies. I’m going to my room. We’ll eat at six o’clock. Benji?
