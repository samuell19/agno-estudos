Help me! Please! What's wrong? There's a man, he's chasing me! He's-he's trying to kill me! It's okay. Okay. Calm down. What does he look like? I don't know. You sure you're being chased? Yes! You been drinking tonight? No. Drugs? No! He chased you down this street? Yes! Are you on any prescription medication?Are you on any prescription medication? Are you on any prescription medication? Yes, but I promise you I'm telling the truth. There was a man, he was chasing after me. He was in the shadows, he jumped out and he attacked me. Please, why aren't you doing something? What do you want me to do? There's nobody there. I don't know. Call for backup. Or search the area. I-I don't know. Go home, lady. I'm telling the truth! Get away from me! Hey, it's okay. Calm down. Hey. Hey. It's okay. All right, relax. Relax, relax. Ma'am, are you okay? Ma'am? Yeah, she's fine. Thanks. Was it the same dream? It's okay. It's all right. Julia.. Julia! Please, please. Julia? Julia, can you hear me? This new medication isn't working. Where are you? A plane. You said that these would work. I said that they would take time to take full effect. I don't know how long I can hold out. Ma'am, you're gonna need to return to your seat. Just a minute. Did you have another dream? I-I don't know if they're dreams anymore. Ma'am, please. Just a minute! Okay, Julia, listen to me. Until you accept what you are experiencing is a dream and not a memory, you are never going to get better, Julia. And these shadow men that are chasing you are figments of your imagination brought on by the trauma that you suffered. Please. Return to your seat and fasten your seatbelt. Now! Pretty nice? It's beautiful. Get used to it 'cause this is home. For now at least. I think we're gonna be okay here. Wait, wait, was that a smile? Maybe. Yes. All right. My baby is back. Thank you for putting up with me. Are you kidding? I'd be dead in a ditch somewhere if it wasn't for you. Well, six months is a long time to stand suicide watch. Child's play. I waited in line for seven hours once at the DMV. I judge all life's hardships by that experience. None even come close. A fresh start begins now. New job, new salary. New house. I'm hoping this distance helps clear me of my demons. Bring it in. Madame. Thank you, my friend. Appreciate it. Arthur? Shane? Yes. And Julia, good to see you. Welcome. Likewise. Pleasure to finally meet you. Welcome to LA. There she is. What do you think? A lot better in person? Yeah, sure is. Your things have arrived last week. It's all inside. You can see your bike is there, all in one piece. Yeah. And my photographs? Photographs, all present and accounted for. So if you want to go inside, the online tour just does not do this place justice. You have to see it in person. The car, does it come with the house or..? Your friend, Robert, he arranged that for you. He's, um, he's a generous guy. Wow. He bought us a car? He bought youa car. Perks of the job, babe. Come on. No, I-I don't want to be beholden to him. This is up to you. Okay? We either do this together or we don't do it at all. So you just let me know. Okay. You sure? Yeah. Thank you. Mwah. Arthur, we're back. Yeah, I was worried there for a second. What was I talking about? Luis... If you, need anything done, if you want to remodel, you need something fixed, he's your man. I'll get you that number as soon as I can. Which reminds me.. there's a banister, the main banister, he has not gotten to that yet. Guys, this is my second favorite part.. Let's do it. Wow. Come on in. Well? Hoo! Well, what do you think? It's big. It is. I knew you'd like it. It's what I do, I make dreams come true. I should put that on my business card. Look around. Feel the space. They're all there. There's no broken glass, no chipped frame. I like that one, by the way. It's nice. Do you know the family? It's, um, my mother and father and me. Well, if they're ever in the market for a place in LA you know who to bring them to, right? They passed. I'm sorry to hear that. I'm sorry. Mr. Larkin? -Yo. I have the lease right here. It's the exact same wording as the one you already approved online, so.. I'd like to, read it anyway, if you don't mind. All right. There you go. Perfect. And if Ms. McNeil wouldn't mind? Jules? Julia... Hey. You need to sign too. Sorry. Um, did you read it? Yeah. Yeah, the first couple of paragraphs. I'm kidding. I read it. It's the same stuff as before: pay the rent on time, don't remove the load bearing walls, et cetera, et cetera. It's the et cetera, et cetera that scares me. Okay, well read it. We're not in a rush. Here you go... Here is a pen. Right there. There you are. Thank you very much. I probably shouldn't tell you this, but there was another couple vying for this house and they were willing to pay quite a bit more per month, but I talked to the management company and I got you in. Why? They were horrid people. Absolutely horrid. They were rich, but horrid. And their kids were the most disgusting little.. Anyway, this- don't get me started. This looks great. We're all set. Um, there's just one final thing. And this is my favorite part.. Shane.. Julia.. Welcome home. Hey, hon? -Just a sec. Time for a break? -What's wrong? There's a man in the house! -What? He just went past the door. -Are you sure? Yes! -You're sure? Yes! - Stay here. Stay there. Jules, come on. It's okay. What was it? That's got to be what you saw. Both the doors are dead bolted. What if somebody has a key? You can only unlock them from the inside. I'm sorry. It's okay. You thought you saw an intruder. I'd rather you say something than have somebody come in and chop us to bits. I'm gonna shower. Julia? Julia! Julia.. It turns out it was a shadow from a chanlier. It's okay. We had sex later that night. Well, thank you for that, Shane. Julia? Julia? Julia? Yes? You called me. My parents... Your parents, or him? They-they saw him. I saw him. Okay, there is no him, Julia. He's on the video. You were a child. A man just happened to be in the park at the same time you were. We met eyes. And..? ..and he killed them. George Fitzgerald, that's his name. Or was his name. The man that was in that video.. he's long dead. He died before your parents- ..were murdered. No, Julia. Okay, look around you, on the walls. Trust me, Julia. I'm guessing there is at least one carbon monoxide detector in there with you somewhere? Your parents made a terrible mistake, and it's a miracle that you are still alive. Let's talk about your other symptoms, shall we? Let's, let's talk about the delusions. I suspect that they will disappear along with her other symptoms. When? This is Julia's session, Shane. When? A couple of weeks on this new medication, Julia, and I think you're gonna be right as rain. I'm gonna hold you to that. All right, I'm out. Goodbye, Shane. Bye, doc. Thank you for always making time for me. I'm here for you, day or night. You know that. Goodbye, Julia. Shane? Hey, Charlie, do you suppose JJ is running around with that young lady? -It looks that way. I-I wonder what it's like. What, Grizz? Well, to be loved by a young girl like that. You know, nobody ever looked at me like that. Not even when I was young. - Yes, when we're young- It was either you or your worthless brother who was driving the car that night. Now who was it? -Him. He drinks vodka. Can't stand scotch. And there were three empty bottles of the cheap stuff in the car when the cops arrived. Now tell me ain, who was behind the wheel? -I don't remember. I remember you were kind once. You're thinking of the other girl! I've never been kind. I've never been kind, I've never been beautiful. I've been told that since I was five years old. You smother a man long enough in those two things, and if a man is a man, he's either going to implode or kick down walls to escape. How would you know what a man does? And cut! May I help you? Yeah. Wardrobe wants their "Mafia Kingpin" outfit back. Show me the boy at seven and I'll show you the pissant at 30. Well, I learned from the best. How's the house? It's gonna be perfect. Thank you. Good. It's good to know. Now we just have to take care of this wardrobe problem. new record to malign my taste in clothes. Well, you're an executive now. And a well-paid executive. Does that mean my cubby's gonna have A/C? Cubby? No, you get an entire wing. Staff.. assistants... You even get your own water cooler. Ooh! You also get a hell of a lot more responsibility. Robert! Okay, look, clean yourself up, pop by the office tomorrow 'cause there's something I have to show you. Okay? What's that? Your future. Nothing's in the bathtub. Not the bathtub, I said the sink. Did you look in the sink? Nothing's in the sink. I checked the sink, the shower drain, the bowl, the cabinets, the closets. Nothing. There's no snake. Do you want me to call animal control? No. My gosh, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Jules? Jules? Julia? Were you waiting for someone else? No. I.. hi. It's so good to see you. It's so good to see you too. Um, the restaurant's that way. Yeah, I know. I just, I saw someone back there I don't really want to talk to. Who was it? I don't know. He walks in the boutique - my boutique - smelling like a brewery. And it's midmorning, mind you. And then he proceeds to tell me that I'm holding him back. That I'm holding himback. Meanwhile, he's 38, doesn't have a job, lives with his parents and writes a blog about skateboarding. So, I tell him to beat it and two minutes later, Colin Farrell comes in and tells me that he just divorced his wife and wants to marry me instead. And you're not listening to a single word I've been saying. Yes, I am. What was I talking about? Um.. I don't know. I'm sorry. I'm really distracted today. Go on, I'm listening. Look, um, I'm gonna tell you something and I don't want you to take it the wrong way, okay? Are you still seeing things? Shadow men? Still? Let's talk about something else, can we? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but I'm concerned. I'm fine. I.. honestly, moving here has been, it's been a godsend. How's Shane? He's great. He's, starting his new job and he's meeting his new boss. I mean, it's his old boss, but new job, you know. So it's good. Stop. You, girl, need to de-stress. No. Yes. My God, yes. Yes. Can I have the check, please? Again. Feel the stress melting away? I think so. Good. Now pretend you're shooting at those shadow ... And maybe an ex-boyfriend from junior year. I guess this is what I have to look forward to now. Beautiful views and shooting guns and Margaritas. Welcome to my so-called life. Cheers. I forgot... Won't cheat on you, lie to you or break your heart. Plus, he always puts the toilet seat down. He? I said "so-called" life for a reason. Give me your drink. I'll let you feel him. Makes you feel invincible, doesn't it? You should get one. ..says Dirty Harry. I'm serious. This city may make you feel alive, but it can kill you. You look beautiful. What? You look beautiful. You're biased. I'm lucky. Someone's in the house! What? I swear! The front door is wide open! Are you sure? -Yes! I-I swear the front door was open. The, the deadbolt's locked. Do you remember that I told you the deadbolt can only be locked from the inside? He could be in the house. He could have come in when I went to get you in the shower. No, Jules! No. No more wine. No, wait! Dr. Leary told me not to indulge you. This conversation is over, I'm sorry. Call the police! Call the police! I'm Skyping Dr. Leary. Wh-what about dinner? We thought they were working, but they're obviously not. She's still having delusions. I told you both that it would take some time for the medication to take full effect. How long? Well, that's impossible to say. Well, what is she supposed to do in the meantime? Chase her delusions around all day? She's got to work. I can't afford this place on my salary alone. I'm not sure why you're getting mad at me, Shane. Because you're her doctor, you're supposed to help her. There's a reason that she was in my care. She is light years from that now and I'm not letting her go back. Are you? No, of course not. Then let me do my job. Julia, I want you to look at me, please. Julia? Okay. These shadow men are not real. Deep down, you know that they're not. Say so, please. Julia, say so, please. The shadow men are not real. You're only delaying your recovery. The shadow men are not real. Okay, again, please. The-the shadow men are not real. Robert... So sorry we're late. It's okay, Shane. No problem. The beautiful and talented Julia McNeil. And the talented, but not so beautiful, Robert Turner. My boss. Pleased to meet you. Nice to finally meet you. Shane's told me a lot about you. Please... Thank you. Well, New York is a particularly brutal city. I know that firsthand. So, well, I'm thrilled you came.. No, thank you. I'm thrilled you came along with Shane, actually. There's, no guarantees, of course, but with Shane's ability I'm quite confident that the both of you are gonna be just fine. Did Annie being here influence your decision? I'm-I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. Shane did mention her to me once, mentioned that you guys were close. A fellow model, was it? Yes, a fellow ex-model. We lived in New York together for three years. I see. And what does she do? She runs a boutique. When she's not drinking excessively or shooting guns. Well, okay. Congratulations, by the way. Shane did mention that you picked up an agent. So, cheers to that. Hopefully, she- Jules? Julia? Are you okay? Julia? I'm sorry. I'm gonna go to the lady's room. Are you sure you're all right? I'm fine. Excuse me. Sure. Where is he? Ma-am.. He was here two seconds ago! Please.. Get off me! Maître d'! Miss, please, you cannot be back here. Julia.. The man I saw earlier today was- he was right here. -He wasn't. Come on. Okay! Okay! It's okay. I'll Skype Dr. Leary. No! I don't need to. Yeah, you do. Shane, the man that I'm seeing is real. Look at me. I'm awake, I-I'm not drunk, I'm awake. I'm seeing him. I saw him twice today. Maybe more, if he was the one in this house. Don't say it. Stop it. He cut the power. There is no "he", okay? We blew a fuse, that's it. Stay there. Goddammit! Where's the fuse box? Is it near the water heater or is it in the garage? I don't know. -What? I don't know! -Never mind, I found it. Julia? Hi. Thank you for seeing me. I promised. You all right? Yeah. I brought you some of my new work. Save it. I know your work. Come. Like I said, things are slow. This is a public service announcement. Yeah, it's union work. Great. Um, I know, but I'm a fashion photographer. Do you not want it? Okay. We've got 20 other photographers I can give it to. No, I'll take it. Thank you. You were hoping for more. I know. I'm sorry. Hi. -Hey. How'd it go? Not great. What happened? I thought you said she owed you? She did. -Well, then what happened? She gave me what she had. Which was what? A PSA for orange juice. - Man. Are the Margaritas ready? Hey! The water's off in my house. I tried to call you, but you didn't pick up, so I tried Shane. Are you all right? That editor friend of yours gave her a crap assignment. Are you kidding me? The water's off in your house? Yeah. What did she give you? Um... a PSA. Unbelievable. I'm so sorry, sweetie. I, asked Annie to stay for dinner earlier. Is that still okay? If you're not up for it I totally understand. No, it's-it's fine. I can't believe she stiffed you. Do you want a glass of wine or something? No. Where is the shoot? Here. Good. At least you can get your studio up and going. You sure you don't mind me staying? I don't want to intrude. It's fine. Cool. I'll get dressed. Would you mind bringing your glass a little closer in? Erin? Thank you. It looks great. Thank you. Hello? Yeah, speaking. Well, you've got a slight concussion. We'll release you, but I want you to stay home and rest for a few days. I'll have the nurse begin the paperwork. How are you feeling? Hey.. did something hit it from outside? No. Yeah, I bet one of the models bumped into it and you didn't even see it. Nobody bumped into it, Shane. I heard a click like it was triggered and it fell and- Triggered? By who? I have an idea. Can you tell me? I'll tell you when I'm more certain. Are you.. Yes! Yes, I'm taking my medication! And yes, it's the right dose! Doesn't it look like it's working? That's not what I was going to ask. I was going to ask if you were feeling well enough to go home or if you want to stay here tonight. Home. Do you want to come over for dinner, drinks, and sex in our shower? Julia! What is that supposed to mean? Jules, what is that supposed to mean? Jules? Do you want to, Skype Dr. Leary? No. All right. What happened? What happened? I just got shocked by the window frame! Shocked? Damn him! -Damn who? Who do you think? -I have no idea what you're talking about! Arthur! The man who rented us this house! -What does he have to do with anything? Julia? Julia, put the phone down. The number you have reached is not in service at this time. Of course. Where are you going? -His office. I don't know why you can't see what he's doing! He's not doing anything to us! He's running us out of this house, Shane. He had someone willing to pay so much more money! Honey... He got an offer he couldn't refuse and he took it. That's not what's happening here. You wanna bet? -Julia, don't do this. This makes sense. That's not what's going on here, okay. That's not what's happening. Julia, call Dr. Leary and Skype her. Julia! Ma'am? You can't go in there. Julia.. Jules! You got the spiral staircase, which you're gonna absolutely love. Julia! ..bring your people- I know what you're doing and it's not gonna work. Arthur, I'm sorry. The men following me? The intruders? The window falling and hitting me on the head, by the way. My, God. The snake? Snake? Snake? He put a snake in our sink. And now a shock from our window frame. We signed a lease. We're staying in the house. Stop trying to drive us out. I'm at an absolute loss. You've been wonderful tenants up until this point. We have no intention of you going anywhere. We're not going anywhere. Unless it's to the police. One more thing happens, I'm filing a report. A report? What? Arthur, I'm sorry. Shane, I-I don't understand. Julia, wait! Julia! Thanks for supporting me in there. -Stop. Stop. Did you see Arthur's printer? -What? Did you see a printer? -No! What kind of office doesn't have a printer? He's got a lamp in there with a tag still on it. The employees, god knows who they are. One of them's working on a computer with the monitor off. Something is going on in there and it's not real estate, I'll tell you that. -Look at me. All right? Take a deep breath. Please. Hey, the snake that you say that you saw in the sink, did anybody else see that? No. -Okay. It was gone by the time Luis got there, but I'm telling you it was there. And the shadow men? The intruders that nobody else sees. Don't do this to me. I'm telling you that man I'm seeing is real. I swear. He's not! Maybe it's the medication. I've heard that it can make people worse. You've been on your old meds for two months now. What? Dr. Leary and I spoke and we thought it would help. You thought that was okay to just do that and not tell me? You were better before, okay, so we put you on your old meds. Okay? Look at me. Hey, hey. Look at me! -No! Hey. Look, I don't know about these things that you're seeing. I don't, I don't. Okay, but I know that I'm real, all right? Okay? I'm real, and I love you and I will do whatever I can to help you through this no matter what. Maybe we need to talk to another doctor, I don't know. But I need you to promise me that you will never do something like this again. Please. Okay? I promise. -Okay. Hello? Hey, where are you? I mean, what do you want me to say? I want you to believe me. I was inside that office, Shane. I saw our house on those monitors. Please, come with me and let me prove to you this is real. If not, you can do whatever you want. I have to go to work. -Just two more minutes. You said that an hour ago. Come on, let's go home. -Here he comes. Not yet. You know what? I'm gonna be right back. -And if she doesn't want to go? Then we go without her. Is she in the back? Annie... Can we talk? I'm busy. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. But you did. Can you forgive me? Please? Look, I'm hanging on by a thread here and I don't know what I'd do if I lost you. There's nothing between Shane and me. Nothing. I know. Jules, you need help. And I'm gonna get it. I promise. I just need to know that you forgive me. Annie, please. Can you forgive me? Yes, I forgive you. He's beneath the bathroom sink. My gift to you. Won't cheat on you, lie to you, or break your heart. You did it. The night I used your shower. Can I ask you for one more thing? Well, buddy, it's moving along really quickly. We just need a few papers signed, so if you can come on in and- Josh, let me call you back. I know what you're up to. Dammit, Julia... Please. Jules.. come on. -These were empty. Julia, come on. Come on, that's enough. No, get off me! Stop it! I'm gonna have to call the police. I'm sorry. Julia.. I mean.. Jules? Please listen to me. You need to calm down, okay? We're gonna get you some help. Look! This room has monitors in it. He has a key to it. There's screens in here. Monitors. Go look! It's not locked. Feel free. It's the monitor room, that's where we monitor the properties. What is this? Each one of these is a feed to a property we manage. This is how we monitor it. It's a security, it lowers our insurance rates. It's very simple, very normal. Open that one. Do it. Open it. This is yesterday. Fast forward it. Julia.. -Go on. More yesterday. Open another one. This is ridiculous. This is- Just do it. I can't continue to do this. Yes, do it! Julia.. It doesn't make any sense. I'm sorry. Fine, I'll do it. -Jules, come on. Come on, Jules, this is going nowhere. No, I'm telling you this proves that they are watching us. It doesn't prove anything. It does! There's nothing there! Maybe you're mistaken. I'm not. I'm not mistaken. They're trying to kill us. They are not. Calm down, Jules. Please. It's all right. It's okay. Good night. Julia, come on. We're leaving. -I'm telling the truth. I was in that room last night. Just rest. You're gonna be okay. Thank you. Hey, I'll be right back, okay? I'm, I'm having her committed tomorrow. Um, I'll come with you. Thank you. And, thank you for forgiving her. That was not her talking the other day. Besides, I owe her my life. I would never abandon her. What do you mean you owe her your life? She helped me out in New York. Let's just leave it at that. See ya. Yeah. Bye. Julia.. Julia! Look! Look, I told you that is a cable that goes to a camera. Julia, stop. Shane, I-I swear I'm not crazy. That goes to a camera. -Julia, stop. It does. It does. Julia, stop! Stop! Go look! Look, there's no camera. There's no shadow men. There's no- there's no conspiracy. It goes into the TV, okay? Look. It's just the TV cable. No. Just come down, okay. Please.. come down. No. Who are you calling? I'm calling Robert. I'm canceling tonight's shoot. I gotta take you to the hospital. No. Yes! No, please! Yes! Just sit down. Please, sit down. Sit down. Please, please. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I promise I'm fine. Hey. Hey, hold on a second. Listen to me, I'm worried you're gonna hurt yourself. I'm- Okay? I'm worried. I'm fine. I promise. I promise. Please, go to your shoot. I just- I want to go back. I want to go back to before this house and this place and this life. I just- You-you... You said.. you said that none of this means anything without me. You meant that, right? Yes. Yes. Hey, things are gonna get better, all right? When? When? When? Shane? Hey, Robert, I'm gonna give you a call back, all right? I gotta tie up a few loose ends at work and we are outta here. Okay? We're outta here. We're outta here. All right? Hey, I am not gonna leave you here like this. All right, I'm gonna stay with you tonight. No. -Yes. No. No, no, babe, no. You go to your shoot tonight, okay. I promise I'm fine. I'm fine. If I know we're leaving, I'm fine. You promise me? I promise. You promise me that you are gonna stay here and that you are gonna call me if anything happens, okay? I promise. I love you. I love you, too. Okay. Okay. Hey. Hey, what's going on? I found them. Found what? The cameras. They're everywhere. The air vents... The lights... You have to come home, please. I have to show you. Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. I hear you breaking a promise that you made to me an hour ago, Julia! No. They're even in the bathroom. Stop it! Skype Dr. Leary. Call Annie. Jules?! Julia! Don't turn around. Give me the password to your computer system. Come on, man. You scared the crap out of me. You should be more careful, Arthur. LA's not a nice city. Not with you in it. You ready? I'm always ready. Good. Let's make some money. Who's the move-in crew? Friends of the boss. Nothing to worry about. Well, she's home. Good. We've got 45 people paying a million dollars a pop to watch her be killed. Boss just texted. Now the episode is a go, 11:30 pm our time. Good. We'll inform the viewers. Okay... We are ready. We're ready. -Cue Paulo. Paulo, go to two. Locking exterior doors. Killing cell phone signal. Yep. This is Julia, leave me a message and I'll call you back. Julia! Shane? Are you hurt? Are you hurt? What happened? The man that was following me, I-I shot him. It's okay. Calm down. Calm down. Did you call 9-11? Did you call- did you call Dr. Leary? Did you call Dr. Leary? Julia, talk to me, okay? How does he know your name? Who? Who, baby? Him. I'm Skyping Dr. Leary. You're pointing a gun at me? You're behind this. Julia.. you're not making any sense, okay? I don't know what you're talking about. I need you to help me to help you right now. Please, just put the gun down. Julia, please. Julia, please put the gun down. I'm done. I love you. I love you so much, but I can't do this anymore. I don't know how to help you, Julia. I don't know how to help you. I can't do this anymore. Wait... I can't- That's really good. Okay. What's wrong? Boy, you're predictable. What's wrong? It's just a delusion. Just another in a string of bad dreams. Why would you do this? Do what? Stop it. You've been fun, Julia. Not the most vocal in bed, not the most interesting, but you've been fun, I'll give you that. Shane... Shane... Tyler.. Andreas... ..., I've been everybody from Aaron to Zach. There's no way out, Julia. How about a trip down memory lane before we finish? Aww.. "How in the world did I find you?" That's you saying that, by the way. "I feel like the luckiest girl in the whole world." Sweet. 9-11, what's the nature of your emergency? I see two men with guns breaking into a building. What is your location? "You're so witty and charming. What few friends I have left think you're amazing." Aww, shucks, baby. 'Cause at the end of the day.. Jules? ..just business. You signed a lease, remember? You know what they say about signing a lease. Always read the fine print. Specifically, Page 14, section nine, paragraph two. "I, the undersigned" - that's you - "agree to participate in the operations of the property owner and its subsidiaries, at my own risk. And hereby release the property owner from all liability in any injury caused, however grievous, up to and including.. death." It's okay. Hold on. He's been in worse spots. Now, listen. This isn't real, Jules. This is just a delusion. Okay? Let's Skype Dr. Leary and talk about it, all right? Jules, I love you. I've been under so much pressure. Jules... I would never hurt you. Bleach the system. Bleach it. -I am. Come in. Hello, Heather. Hi. You're gonna do just fine out there. Don't worry. I'll see you out. You're gonna do great. And remember, you can call me any time, day or night. Heather? Yeah. Heather Sloan? Yes. No way... Josh Harrington. We were in fifth grade together at Fletcher Elementary. You look exactly the same. I'm sorry, I, um, I don't remember you. It's been 20 years, so that's okay. How have you been? Okay. Yeah. Wow. Are you visiting someone? Um, my aunt had a little bit of a meltdown the other day so we brought her here to see a specialist. Do you live around here? You need a ride or anything? I'm on my way out. I, um, I have a bus ticket. Where you headed? Bernardsville. I live in Pine Ridge. It's like two miles from Bernardsville. I'd be happy to drop you off. It's up to you. You know what, um, how about this. Give me your phone number, I'll give you a call and we can grab a coffee some time. I'd love a ride. You sure? Is that okay? It's okay with me. Wow. Let me grab that for you. Thanks. Bye. Thank you. So what have you been up to these days? You know, like for work? -I haven't worked in a while. Not since my parents died, actually. I'm so sorry. -What do you do? I managed to get into the film industry somehow. I produce movies now.
