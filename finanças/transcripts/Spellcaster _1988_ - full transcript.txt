And now I've got to spend a god awful weekend in some stink hole castle. - Watch out, dear, you'll crack the lens. - I don't give a shit. - Oh, it's the police and I don't see Sting. - Yeah, excuse me just a little moment. - Jamie, no cameras. Jackie, where the hell is the limo? - The plane was two hours late. - Yeah, I know, but we're supposed to be picked up in a limo at the airport, okay? - Do you remember what Mom used to say? - What? - "What happens is supposed to happen." - Great, what's supposed to happen is we're supposed to be riding in a limo right now with air conditioning. Oh please, that one's mine. That green one, that's mine. - Oh, madam, ma'am. - Ah, I think we've found our lost orphans. - We're the winners from Cleveland. - No such thing, kid. - What are you looking at? - Oh nothing. I just didn't get a chance to say hello before. Hi. - So you said it. Now piss off. - So are you gonna come in the castle soon? - A woman's limo is her castle. - Just forget it, Tom. She's not your type. - All right, kids, you could make it. All right, let's all pile into the limo and get the welcome shot. Cassandra. Baby. Cassandra, time to take the big arrival shot. Okay, uh, we'll pick up this one a little later, but in the meantime, let's all go inside and get settled. Later. - Hey, Billy, Andy, listen. I want you guys to get hold of a high definition camera for me, the best one you can find. I think some really interesting things are gonna happen in the dark here this weekend. - I got lights. - Yeah, but with an HD we can pick up some stuff. Hey, two points apiece. - Ah, I don't know, that's pretty chintzy, Jamie. - Yeah? Well, it's either that or doing Merv Griffin the rest of your life. - It's not gonna be easy to find. We're gonna have to go to Rome. - Yeah. Andiamo Boys. - Welcome, winners, to Castle Diaboli. This is one of the oldest castles in all of Italy. Cut to the chase. When do we start searching for the money? - Soon. - Next we go down the stairs. - When do we eat? - Sooner, fatso. - Hey, come check this. Whoa. - I'm not accustomed to carrying my own luggage. - Well, I'll help you. What do you got in here? - Guns. I thought I'd get in a little shooting. Rabbits, birds, maybe a boar. - Yeah well, I'll do my best to be interesting, okay? Lots of luggage. - Not exactly what I was expecting. Nice thing. Oh. Yeah, I think so. - Is somebody meeting us there? Where's my room? - I thought there were supposed to be servants. - Senor Diaboli welcomes you. - Oh, it's beautiful. - Of course it's beautiful. It's French. It's 14th century and it's worth about three million francs. - I love French things. You know, french fries, french toast, french kissing. - You know, like there's no mirrors here. - And why do you need a mirror when I am here to tell you how lovely you look? - So I can see for myself. Oh. You Americans are so romantic. - I'm sorry. It looks so real. It's beautiful. - Yes. Senor Diaboli is quite proud of his pieces. - He's really generous to let us all stay here. - He enjoys having guests once every now and then. - Will he be with us at dinner? - He will be with you all eventually. - Over there. - Let me ask you something. Do you always carry an arsenal around with you? - When the occasion calls for it. - I hate to be like bearer of bad tidings, but this is a fun weekend. We're supposed to party, okay? - After this ridiculous weekend, I'm off on safari with Fergie and Andrew. - It's 7:00 Rock TVers and time to boogie down with Mr. Death. - This is one creepy place. - Ah, don't worry about it. Think of it as a Olympic million-dollar treasure hunt. - Well, just don't get your hopes up. - Why not? Have you seen our competition? I see a Porsche 959 Turbo, a pool with a jacuzzi. - In your Porsche? - Why not? I see a yacht, 40 foot long, my name written all over it. - How 'bout a college education with your name written all over it? - Wrong. You spend your half of the money your way, I've got big plans for mine. - Tom, you just have to be realistic. The chances of us finding the money are two in seven. - Yes, but that's one more than everybody else here. Why are you so pessimistic? - I don't know. All these different people brought together in this old place. Whoa, you think it's a setup? - No, it's just weird. - Jackie, weird can be fun. Go with it. You could use some weirdness in your life. I can't see a damn thing. You know we should almost be there. - We should definitely be there. - You probably took a wrong road or something. There is only one road. - Then where's the castle? - I don't know. - You don't know. The car just died. - Why? I don't know. - You don't know. We're on some honky chase after an HD camera, stuck in the middle of nowhere in a dead car, and you don't know. - Let me take a look under the hood. The door's stuck. - Wait a minute, my door's stuck too. - We are lost in the middle of nowhere, we can't find the castle, and the car won't start. What else could possibly go wrong? Not exactly the atmosphere for a pig out. - Please let that be the extent of our dinner conversation. I should rather hear you slobber and chew than try and speak English. - I'm anxious to meet Senor Diaboli. - Yeah, he must be pretty crazy to let all this go on in his house. - The word is eccentric. Whoop excuse me. I dropped my glass. Oop! If I don't eat soon, I'm going to puke. - Senor Diaboli sends his regrets. He will not be joining you for dinner. - Jamie, where is the bloody camera crew? - I sent them to Rome to get some equipment. - If you dare screw this up- - Yeah, I know. Merv. - Just get over there. - Okay. - Well, we got a great dinner coming up but first of all, gotta give you the rules for the videotape for the viewers at home. Jamie, if you're ready. - Yes. - Roll tape. How do I look? Okay? Yeah, you look fine. Let's go. - Okay. Hey, "Rock TV" viewers at home. We're here with our seven lucky winners and it's time to give them the lowdown on how to score those big bucks. Well, as you know, you've all signed a contract and agreed to abide by "Rock TV's" rules. Now, the conditions are very, very simple. The treasure hunt starts tomorrow morning promptly at dawn. And in fairness to Senor Diaboli, who's been nice enough to lend us his castle, we have to tell you that the check for one million dollars has been hidden and hidden well but not in a place that would necessitate any digging or any tearing. In other words, there's to be no damage to any of the property here. - But we can look anywhere, yes? - Yes, anywhere except outside of the castle. You're free to leave the castle at any time, but if you do, you will be disqualified. But right now let's start the fun. It's a rock 'n' roll weekend and we're gonna party with everyone's favorite party girl, Cassandra Castle. - I hear many interesting things aboutAmerican women. - Like what? - That they are naive and silly and ignorant of love. That sounds like me all right. So I will dare to tutor you in the language of love. - I'm not very good at learning languages. I hate the grammar part. Excuse me. Tom! Tom! I was intoxicated by your beauty. - Tom! - Your room is this way. - What? I just escaped from Italian class. - What? - Forget it. I'm going to bed. - No, no, no. Wait. Why waste time sleeping? - This doesn't sound like you. - No, I mean, we could start searching now. - It's against the rules. - There's only one rule, to win. - I'm tired. I'm going to bed. - Okay. - You have got to slow down. - What do you think you're doing? Putting you to bed. - I know the way your filthy mind works. Stupid DJ. - I'm a VJ and the last thing I need is some manufactured superstar who can't even stay sober for her own celebrity weekend. - Oh yeah? - Yeah! - What else am I supposed to do? Besides it's my record company that's paying for this weekend. I bet there isn't even a check. - Oh there's a check. And it's a real one. - Yeah, for the camera. Bet nobody finds it. - Hey, that depends on them. - I'll make you a deal. I'll hide the check somewhere no one will find it. Hey getting tricky, that could give us some very bad publicity. - Not when I reveal on camera where it is. - Now, that's not bad. That's not bad at all. - But you've gotta keep that brat pack away from me. I don't wanna see them at all the whole weekend. Your record label's not gonna like this. But screw them. - Is it a deal? - Deal. - 50/50 if you find the check. - What are you doing here? - I'm looking for the check. What are you doing here? - I'm looking for something to eat. Harlan. - Tom. Listen if there's a check in that cake, I get half of it, okay? - Hello. Who's there? - Oh, I'm sorry. I must have the wrong room. - Maybe. Maybe not. Depends on what You're looking for. Well, you know, I thought I would take just a little look for the check before I went to bed. Now, you know, Yvette, that is definitely cheating. - Yes, I know. Forgive me. What do you think I should do about this? - Well, you could punish me. Or you could help me. Or you could punish me and help me. - What's the matter? - Well, you were going to tell me a clue. Was I? - Mm, yes, you were. You were going to give me a very good clue. - Okay. Okay. It's hidden somewhere on the first floor. - Is that it? It is on the first floor? That is not helping. it is. Cuts the field in half. Just don't be too obvious about it. Well, all right. I've always had this special passion for DJs. - VJs. - Not cheating are we? Interesting decor. - Nothing here but old furniture. - Old furniture worth 175,000 pounds. - Well, yes. You know antiques? - My parents collect them. - My parents sell them. - Well, that's the difference between us, don't you see. You're insane. But then you're French. English bitch! - Come here. Ooh. Mm. Ooh. What is this? Mm. Ooh. Oh. Oh, oh, oh. Help! Help me! - Hey, are you okay? You okay? - Hey, what's going on? Are we gonna have a party? - Oh, she's drunk. No. There were loads and loads of... What? Who? What are you talking about? - What the bloody hell is going on out here? What are you all doing? - I didn't know we were confined to our rooms. - Listen, if anyone is found looking for the check before the contest officially starts, he or she will be disqualified. - Well, what about her? - I'll take care of her. The rest of you go back to your rooms and get some sleep. You've got a big day tomorrow. - Whoa, it's 7:00 back in Jersey. Past my bedtime. Good night. - Yeah. - I was wondering if you could help me. - I was wondering that myself. - My shower isn't working. - Well, I'm not very good at plumbing stuff, you know. - Maybe it won't take much. You had enough hours ago. I just saw... God, you won't believe me. - No, I probably won't. - I was in this dungeon and there were these zombies, these giant zombies with skull faces and hands and they were after me. - Yeah, I've seen "Lost Weekend". - No really! I saw it! I opened this door and I went down these steps, these stone steps- - Listen, that was my door. - No. - If you can't keep it together, our deal is off. All you have to do is hang onto the check and stay out of my bloody way. - You think I'm crazy. - No, I don't. I think you're an alcoholic. No more of this. Not until the contest is over. You're right, you're right. No more juice. Pills. I need pills. I just need something to keep me out of it for a while. - Seems to be working fine to me. - Well then, how am I gonna thank you? Well, if you find The check, you can split it with me. - Oh, come on. Is that all you're here for, the money? Wouldn't you like to have a little fun? - When you're right, you're right. Except, what was the question? - Would you wash my back? - Wash your back? Yeah. I'll do it. I'm a full-service repairman. Back wash is part of the job. - Go slow. I like it better that way. Thank you. - Wait, what's going on? - I'm done. - Done what? - Done taking a shower. - What comes next? - I don't know. I'll probably listen to some music, go to bed early. You know, it's gonna be a big day tomorrow. - Wait, I thought we were gonna... - What? - Well, you know. - Oh, sorry, I just took a shower. These must be really sick kicks you're getting from this. Really sick. - Oh, my therapist says there's no such thing as sick kicks. - You're a bitch, okay? - Well, I said thank you. - You know, that was really shitty of you to do to me. - I can understand how you can have this attitude. It's very valid. It's okay. Bye bye. - I'm wet. - What happened? - Nothing. It's the worst kind of nothing. When something almost happens but doesn't. That kind of nothing. - You didn't find the check. - No. Jackie, may I ask you, is it me? It is me, isn't it? - Get some sleep and we'll find it tomorrow together. You're wet. - Hello, what's for breakfast, kids? Heavy metal! - Live from "Rock TV" it's the Heavy Metal Breakfast Club. Dude! - I'd rather keep my temper this morning. "Rock TV" all day, every day Is part of this million dollar weekend. - Hey, Rex, I thought that the Heavy Metal Breakfast Club was a live show. - Harlan, it is live, live on tape. - Mm. - Hey, so where's our superstar this morning? Suppose she's sleeping it off. - When do the games begin? - When everybody gets here. - Well, where's Yvette? - The last time I saw her, she was drooling over the antiques. - Where's the American, Teri? - Here I am. I like to workout before breakfast. - I bet she just has tons of energy too. - I regret to inform you that Senor Diaboli again will be unable to join you. - I am an Italian and I have never heard of this castle or Senor Diaboli. - Yes, but you have heard of the police. - The red Ferrari? Misunderstanding. - Might've been a misunderstanding for you, punk, but it cost me and it cost "Rock TV" a lot of money and we have to settle that. - Well, come on! What are we waiting for? Let's start this puppy. - Okay, Jamie, roll tape. Couple of rules to remember. The castle is filled with priceless antiques and valuables and you must not damage any of the property here. - Cut it. - You got speed? - Yeah, ready. - And look? - Yeah, you look great. - Okay, "Rock TV" here's the lucky seven- - Wait a minute. I just don't think it's right to start without Yvette. - I found this letter when I went to call mademoiselle for breakfast. - "I must leave immediately for Lyon. Family emergency. Bonne chance, Yvette." - Okay, roll tape. Hey, Rock TVers at home. We're on location in Italy at the castle of Senor Diaboli and what a turn of events. One of our contestants, Yvette, has had to drop out due to unforeseen family emergencies. But that's good news for our remaining lucky six because they now have a better chance at that one million dollars. And that's a lot of scratch for any high-livin' rock 'n' roller. Are you ready to go for it? - Yeah! - All right, on your marks. Get set. Wait for it. Go! - I don't intend for the rest of you to benefit from my superior tracking ability. If you don't mind. - I think I'm going to ask the "I Ching" where it is. Do you wanna come? - I always want to come. - I've been having a little trouble with my shower too. - You want upstairs or downstairs? - Uh, I'll take the high road. - Okay. - Okay, love you, bye. Ciao. - Yeah. Oh bitch! - You, America are so right. - What the hell's going on? What are you doing in here? Get the hell out of here! - Hell, hell, hell. We shall speaking about paradise. Oh my god. Get off me! Get... - No, this won't happen to Tony Capri. Women who will treat me like- - Help! - You all the time. - You screamed, madam? - Get him off me! - Yes, madam. Senor Diaboli's guests must be treated with respect. Oh no. - What's wrong? - Well, looking for a check in a library is sorta like looking for a needle in a stack of needles. Oh well. The price is right. - Do you know what these books are? - Yeah, potential hiding places. - They're Bibles. - Well, I'll go to confession later when I'm Catholic. - We're not supposed to damage any of Senor Diaboli's property. - Well, if they're all the same book, it hardly seems to matter. This is definitely not in the "I Ching". Ow. Oh, damn contact lens. Ah, got it. Found it. I'm glad it's you. It is with real pleasure. What do you want, greaseball? - Yes, I'm a greaseball but now, now I'm a rich one. Give. - What? - What you have just found. - My contact lens? - Don't play with me! No more playing games! I'm Tony Capri and I take what I want, okay? Okay. - Fine. Just what do you want? - What do you think? The check, the million dollars. - I don't have it! - You found it. I heard you. - Ah, please. You've gotta believe me. I found a contact lens. - Oh, a cocktail lens, yes. And I'm sure your shower really was broken, huh? - I swear I don't have it. - Okay, then I will have to search you. I will be the winner. - Are you okay? - He was gonna kill me! - Come on, let's get out of here. - Oh, I gonna kill- - Come on! ♪ Passionate crime ♪ - Oh no. - I can't even believe what he did. Oh my god. The check. Tom and I will split it with you. - Forget it! I won! - I just saved your life back there. The least you could do is split it with us. - No way. I went for it and I won. End of discussion. - Bitch. Where'd it go? - We're having fun now. - There you are. Something very strange is going on here. - Whose shoe is this? - The French girl's I think. Tony just attacked Teri. - I'm not surprised. - With a knife? - It's one way to lessen the odds, isn't it? - Let's go home. - No. No, Jackie, the odds are shorter for us too. Let's just stick together, okay? - This place is dangerous. - No, just calm down for a second, okay? Look, if the other people are disqualified or maybe even worse, they'll call it off. But until then I'm gonna keep searching. - Please, Tom. Come on, Jackie, let's just go search for the money. We're gonna find it, okay? Just don't worry about it. It's gonna be okay. - Get me out! Somebody, let me out! Can anybody hear me? - What's the matter? What happened? - What? Oh nothing, nothing. - What do you mean nothing? You were just yelling for help. - Oh, oh, I was having trouble with my lace. You can't even dress yourself anymore. We have to shoot the big revelation scene in one hour's time. Look, meet me in the weapons room. I'll get Jamie. In the meantime, I'm gonna hold onto this check. I kept my part of the deal. - One bloody hour! Well, the others may wanna spend all day in musty dungeons but I need some lunch. - Yes, sir. Would you care for a pig out? - That's the idea. Hey, you're all right. What's the matter, babe? - I don't wanna talk about it so just leave me alone. - So Mickey Mouse is suing Minnie Mouse for divorce, right? And they're in front of the judge and the judge says, "Look, Mickey, you can't divorce Minnie just because she's crazy." And Mickey says, "I didn't say she was crazy. I said she was-" - Fucking Goofy. - You've heard it before. - Don't talk to me. I had it right in my hand, right in my hand! - What? - I said don't talk to me! - Sir. - Wow. - That's disgusting! Oh, that's gross. - Here, you want a piece? - I don't eat meat. - Mm. Mm. Mm. Here. - Oh, you're such a pig! - This reminds me. Did you hear the one about the three pigs that went to Rome? Two of them were arrested. You know why? - No. - Because the third one squealed! Ah! Hey, Teri, what's the matter? It's just a joke. Come on, you can take a joke, can't you? Is there, is there a problem? Come on. I'll help you with the money. - Where is Jamie? - It's not my job. - I tell you, she has screwed up so many times. After this gig, I am gonna see to it that she doesn't even do weddings. - How did "Rock TV" ever find this place? - We got a good deal. - Yeah, with my bloody money. - You know, if it wasn't for "Rock TV"... You just keep your bloody money. And from now on, you are on your own. - You bastard! - Yeah, the hell with chivalry. Oh! - Fuck? Oh! Ow, ah! Oh, it's... Yeah. - Ah! - Oh! - Oh! - Yeah. Come on. Yeah! - Ooh. - Okay, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Shh. - Jackie, why didn't you tell me about the check? - I wanna go, Tom. Something is wrong here. - No, we're close. I can feel it. Jackie take that side of the hall. I'll take this side down here. - Please, Tom. - I'll be down the hall, okay? - Teri? - Hey, it's okay. It's okay. Cassandra. - Are you okay? Something, I can't remember. Something horrible! - Just take it easy, okay? - I'm not drunk. - Look, I know it's hard being a superstar and all. - I don't know what I am. - You know, your fans really love you. They love you a lot. - It's not love. - Some of 'em do. - Teri. - Interesting man, Diaboli, letting game run wild indoors. It was part human. - It was hard to tell from shooting distance actually. Had to give it A sporting chance, you know. This is crazy. - Yes. Well, the servants will clean it up. Look, you better hold onto this. There might be others about. Any luck with the check yet? - The what? - Oh, too bad. I'll be off then. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - For what? - For taking advantage of you like this. I'm sorry. - Listen, I'm in the music business, all right? People take advantage of me all the time. This, this was different though. It was real. - Yeah, but still... Look, in your condition, it was wrong. - I'm not drunk. I don't know what's been happening. I do know I like you. - Look, I didn't kiss you just because you're who you are, you know? - You don't have to explain. - Tom! Who are you? Welcome, you overcame your fear. You made it. - Where, where am I? Your room, my room, any room. Doesn't really matter. All that matters is that you won. - Senor Diaboli? - You bet. - Is this a video or something? No, no. It's real life and real death. - You killed all of 'em? - Yes. But from what I can see, which is everything, they deserved it. - But how? - Oh, an oldie but a goodie, black magic. They don't make deaths like that anymore. More's the pity. Perhaps you'd like to check it out. Where are they? - In limbo Land. We'll all go down together. - Go down? - Home. - Home? You mean hell? But Tom... - Oh, don't worry. He's still alive. But it's his turn next. - What, is this the check? - Yeah. - This is the check? Wait a minute, I won, I won! - I guess you did. - I just won a million dollars. Aye, you had this all the time, didn't you? I love you. - Why? 'Cause I had a million dollars? - You know what this means? I am totally free of school. I don't have to work the rest of my life. You understand that? - Tom, listen, you don't realize what goes along with that million dollars. - Oh, I don't, I don't? Yeah, I do, I do. A Porsche, a projection TV. I get to move to California. - Don't do it. - Don't do what? Don't do what, win? Why? What are you nuts? - No, I'm not nuts and I'm not drunk. I'm Tracy Collins from Wraysbury and I've got $18 million. That almost made me nuts. That is mine! - No, it owns you and it always will unless you give it up. - Look, just be real careful with that check, okay? - Did I look like that? Was I that pathetic? - I'll make you a deal. What do you want? I'll make you a deal, Cassandra. - Don't make a deal with your soul, my dear. No! - Shit. She screwed it up. He was supposed to keep the check and be consumed by fire. That's it. She's doomed. That's it, lady, you're history. - That wasn't the deal. - You broke the deal when you interfered with the test. He's a good kid. - He's a loser and he's mine. - That's cheating. - Cheating? Oh do tell me about it. Isn't that the way you got what you wanted, rock 'n' roll star? - Yeah, and you got my soul, that's it. - Oh, read the small print, darling. You also keep out of my way. You've got knowledge. You are dangerous. You're coming with me. - No! Let her go. Let all of 'em go. - Not only am I not letting them go, I'm gonna take your little brother too. - I'm not kidding. - And I'm not mortal. Go ahead, make my day. - I'll make you a deal. - No, save yourself. - I'm all ears. - You can take me but you let Tom go. - Deal. - And he gets the million dollars. Not a problem. And Cassandra gets her soul back. - Look, forget about me. Just take your brother and the money and run! - You got a lotta soul, little lady. It's a deal. But you've gotta do something naughty to seal it. - I figured. - No! - Oh. - Where are we? Oh. Where am I? I musta been dreaming. - I don't know who this... - This is strange. Mm-hmm. Oh no, oh my god, all this stuff. Ooh, like could we get outta here now? Yeah, I don't know what that was in our drinks last night. Let's go on. To "Rock TV". - Jackie. - Tom! You're okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Cassandra. Look, I've gotta find Cassandra. - What happens is supposed to happen, remember? Here. - Doesn't seem like that big of a deal now, does it? I really blew it, Jackie. Oh, Cassandra. - Just plain Tracy now. - Cassandra. Thought I lost you. - How did you do it? - I modified the deal. I got my soul back and everyone else gets a second chance. I traded him our contract for something completely different. He's a VJ now. Let him deal with those devils. - Welcome back. I'm Cy Diabolo, here on "Rock TV", America's number one video music channel. You know it's rather extraordinary the number of times I've overheard people say, oh, I'd give anything to be a rock 'n' roll star. Well, I've dreamt up this little competition which could result in just that. The winner gets it all. A five-year recording contract, a million dollars in cash , and the chance to go all the way. It's an offer you simply can't refuse. Interested? You should be. Let me tell you about it. Are you sitting comfortably?
