Kenny! Kenny! Did you come to take me home? What are you doing? Don't you know the time? Don't sweat it man, I was just about to leave. Wait one second. Hurry up! Well, wait. You're slow man. I'm sick and tired of always looking after you. I'm not your babysitter. What are you talking about! You know what I'm talking about. I always have to go and pick you up I never asked you to come and get me. -Oh yeah. -Let me get off the bike. Just let me off the bike! -Cut the crap, man. Mom told me to come and pick you up. Thank you. What took so long? -I looked for him all over the place. -Where was he? Down by the place. Kenny? Yeah, I know, even if I'm gonna be 13... I've still gotta stick around the house. Well if you're that big, you should know what time dinner is. Now hurry up Go change your diaper and wash them filthy hands. All right. Oh yeah, I don't have school tomorrow, so I'm gonna go out! Oh yeah, well we'll think about that. What! I said, we'll see about that later. What, you think just 'cos I'm big, I'm not afraid of things. Take you sister for instance, look how small she is? And she still scares me sometimes. Doesn't she scare you? -Yeah, but, I hate this feeling. Kenny? Being afraid is nothing to be ashamed of. Everybody's afraid sometime in their life, and if they tell you different... they're lying to you. Fear makes you cautious, so you don't get hurt. It can be good sometimes. The biggest thing I fear... is failure. That's what makes me train so hard. Wait a minute. I think I better cut this bull and go and take a shower. Are you sure you're not gonna be afraid walking home all by yourself now? I'm not a chicken, like you. Wee little dickhead! You haven't kissed me yet. That's not kissing. Cut it out! I know your not sleeping. Quit that! Stop! Get off of me! Quit! -Quit! -Punk! Quit! Punk! I'm sick of you! -Don't go crying to Mommy now! -Quit it! Your gonna cry to Mommy, right. Huh! Can you tell me what's going on in here? Can I have an answer, please? Him, bugging me and Cathy. -He's jealous, that's all. -It isn't true! I don't care about you and Cathy's big tits! Hey! Do you want your dad in here? Go to sleep. It isn't true, I'm not jealous. Not even jealous. Do I have to? Kenny, quit your mouthing, before I give you a smack! -What's wrong? -Nothing. I thought you decided to wear the legs? I know. I changed my mind. I don't wanna talk about it. Well, you told me that... you agreed with the school that it would be better for you. I know. That's what you told me. I just don't wanna talk about it right now. If you wear the legs... If she gives you any problems, you just... kick her in the pants. You just try! -All right? -Yeah. Come on, we'll be late. Drive careful. Dr. Greenburg... Hi, I'm sorry I'm late. Hi, Kenny? How are you doing? -Fine. -That's good. Come on Kenny, cheer up! You haven't smiled once since you came in here. Now I don't mind making little jokes for my guests, but you gotta show me some teeth. At least let me know you're listening. How about a little snicker? I thought you had a sense of humour in there. He's upset. He thought that when we put the other legs away... he'd never have to wear them again. -You promised. Those nice new legs of yours, will make you look... just like all the rest of the kids at Junior High. I don't wanna look like them. I wanna be my own normal self. Ah, you've got a point there. I think I know what you mean. Something almost like that happened to me one time. Some people thought that I should wear a toupee, so that I looked like everybody else. Let me tell you, I didn't feel anything but silly. I threw the thing away after 3 very long days. See Mom, at least somebody agrees with me. Now... let's just say that I understand how you feel. But, we have to be realistic here and... and face the facts that even though you feel and are normal, that's not how you appear to most people. Especially when they first meet you. They get used to me when they get to know me. You're absolutely right. But I think that we should trust your new principals judgement here. Now he probably knows what's best for you at his school. My parents already told me that. There, see? Now cheer up. Think about how lucky you are, to have these... two lovely woman, rubbing their hands all over your body. Hi! Better Hurry! Mom's downstairs talking to Pam. You got all kinda lipstick all over your face. What the hell. If it's for me. Tell them I'll phone back later. Hello? Allô... allô. Yes... Hello? -...French Television... from Paris -Yes. Mr. Easterday? Mr. or Mrs. Easterday, please. -Yes. -Could I speak to one of them? -Pardon? Could I speak to Mr. or Mrs. Easterday, please. -Yes. Hold on. -Okay. Mom! Mom, wake up! -What? There's some French guy on the telephone and he wants to talk to you. What French guy? All he did was start to talk about TV. Oh, shit! Dad! Dad! Come on, wake up. Come on! -Oh, go to sleep, Kenny. -Oh, come on! -Go to sleep. What is he talking about? What does he want? -Allô... -Yeah. Yeah... yeah, I know, but I don't know how much more anyone can say about us, I mean... We had the Japanese and we had the Germans and we had the English. I understand but... you know, you must realise that... French people have not seen what the... Japanese, the German and the English have done. Mom, did they say Sharon Kay's gonna be in the movie? They've seen the other TV shows, and they thought she was real good as the loving big sister. They like that kinda stuff. So that means she's gonna come and live with us like the last time? I don't know about that. But I'm sure she wouldn't wanna miss being in the show. All she thinks about is being a movie star. I wouldn't mind being a movie star myself. You can't be no movie star. Why? Too skinny. Hey! Anyway, you don't gotta worry about being no movie star, 'cos they ain't here yet. I didn't tell them yes. Oh, Mom! It's gonna be lots of fun. -Huh! Mrs. Easterday, what was your reaction when you first saw him? Did you love him right away? Cut it out. You mean you don't love him anymore? Hi. Son of a bitch, he did it again. Have you got any coffee? Where are the girls? He just left with both of them. Are you done eating? Yeah. Then why don't you go get dressed. Okay. Kenny, why don't you go take Tommy out for a little walk. Do I have to? Move it. -Do you wanna go play? -Yeah. Tommy, stop it! Don't do that! Leave the dogs alone! Tommy, don't do that! Tommy, quit it! Get away from that fence, you little bastards! Sorry Mr. Nilan, he won't do it again. Ah, don't go shitting me, you little sneak. Get the fuck out! Get out of the way. Go ahead. -Hi. -Sorry Ken, I'm in a hurry. I have to pick Sharon Kay up, and I'm late. You know her, She's the only one allowed to be late. Hey, wait a second. Tell Sharon Kay some French TV people are coming and she should call Mom. -All right, I'll let her know. -Wait! Where are you going, anyways? Don't worry about it. Your sister can take care of herself. You don't always have to be looking after her. And besides, I'm your friend, trust me. We'll see ya. -All right. Okay. Tommy, come on up. No, I'm too tired. Whatever... Grandpa's here. Come on. -Hi! -Hi there, how are you doing? All right. Are you going home? No, Billy told us all about the TV people from Europe. So we came to get all the news. Could I get a ride? But I wouldn't take this shit, no more. Un-huh, I heard you. Come here, buddy. Guess who came with us? Hey, there! Hi Dad. As soon as I heard the news from Billy about the TV people, we had to leave the house. Well you know your mother, she couldn't wait, She had to come and get more details. Didn't even let me finish my coffee. Why don't you shut up, if you don't have anything more intelligent to say. Well, maybe I'll make some coffee. Coffee, anybody? -Yeah, I'll have some more. -Pam, you? -Sure, thanks. How about you, my dear? Will you have some? You know damn well I don't want any coffee. -I haven't had any for 20 years. -Ok, ok, don't get upset, I'm just trying to be polite. Go on Sharon, why don't you tell your mother about this TV business. Don't you see she's getting nervous. Nothing much to tell. These French people saw the English show, and they wanna do the same thing, I guesss. The guy's gonna call again tomorrow morning and if I say yes, they'll get here next week. That other director put it in Kenny's head, that it's good for handicapped people when he's on TV. I'm not so sure about that. It was, umm... I don't know how to say it, it was pure hell. Umm... I just... I couldn't touch him. I... I just couldn't get myself to... handle him. Er... Sharon was afraid to... er... physically harm him. and er... the boy was so small, that I did the... I... I bathed him and did the diapers. Uh-huh. He... he just had to do everything. Did you... despise him? What? Did you have any negative feelings towards him? No. No, I was loving him the whole time, I just couldn't touch him. Could you tell us, when the change happened? You know, how it happened. -That I could handle him? -Yes. Well... One day, Jesse had gone out, and Kenny and I were left by ourselves in the house. and he was supposed to sleep, but he wouldn't. and er... he started to cry, so I went into his room, and... I looked down at him in the crib and... I was talking to him and... he was sort of... reaching up with his little fists. And I just thought, my God, this is my baby, and... I reached down and I picked him up, and... he grabbed hold of me, as if to say, "Well it's about time, Mommy". And... I... Could you turn that thing off? Can you just turn that damn thing off! Bon, coupé là, ca suffit. I'm sorry. It's just.. seeing something that's so important to me... in front of this thing... I just feel that I'm lying or... something... -I understand Mrs. Easterday... -You can call me Sharon. Okay, thank you. So, we'll stop for now. and we'll wait until Kenny comes home, okay? So, you're finished with me, I can take these back in the house? Yes, yes that's all for now. Thank you. Thank you very much. -Hi Sarah, how are you doing? -Okay. The movies are back in town, eh? -Yep, we got the Frenchies this time. -The French. And I think the director wants to talk to you. -Hello. -Hi. Sarah, this is Mr... -Hi, nice to meet you. -Like I said. But you can call me Louis Philip. -Pardon me, what was that? -Louis Philip. How about Phil? -Only if you insist. -I do, I do. Oh, and this must be Kenny, right? What's up Philly? Et coupé! Very good. Ca va, please. Could you wait a minute before you take Kenny down the lift? -Sure. -Okay, because I just want to... make a new setup with the camera to get a closer view. -Is this gonna take a long time? -Couple of minutes. Because I still have two more kids that I have to deliver. I know, I understand. You had to let me know in advance. It wasn't planned, and it's the last minute inspiration, but it's gonna be very beautiful. Mrs. Easterday, please. can you come here a minute. What I would like you to do, is when Kenny goes down the lift, is you go and greet him... with a warm kiss. But I never do that. I know, but see, we've very little time... to show the French audience the relationship between... you and you're son, the warm feelings, you know? -So... -Okay. Okay, I'll do it. Thank you. Et coupé! Beautiful. Absolutely wonderful. There's one thing I'd like to redo though. Mrs. Easterday, if you don't mind. It is the time when you greet him, and I want to use a different setup, much closer, okay? To get a closer view of this beautiful love, I know, I know. Okay. Let's go. Let's go for it. Let's go. Okay, now... very good, very good. We're still rolling the camera, still going on. Can we do it one more time, but this time Mrs. Easterday, please... a little more slowly and a little more softly. Okay. Can we have the thing up, please. Happy. but not, not too... too much, eh? Okay, good. Ready? Action! Fantastic... fantastic Now we're still rolling... and this is just... this is only for safety reasons, okay. Because we've got everything... Very good Now please, you're on a little, you know, low down. Because otherwise we miss the... you know, Kenny's face. -Very good. -All right. -You okay, Kenny? -Yes. -Are you comfortable? -Yes. Good. Okay. Now please, be serious. Be serious, we have to finish now. Very good. And action! Coupé! Don't get me wrong. It's got nothing to do with that kissing scene. I mean, I do kiss my son, once in a while, but... anyway... what I'm trying to say is, like, when the English movie people came. They found a way to make us look real religious, going to church and all that stuff. And the truth is, we ain't been to no church in at least 6 years. I mean, why do they have to make such a lie, just to get their show? -Well, Mrs. Easterday... -Please, call me Sharon. I'm sorry, eh... okay Sharon... I can assure you, I will do the impossible, not to do, anything you dislike. But I do need certain images. Do you understand? Don't look at me buddy... Baby, eh? No, I've never seen her bite at nobody, though. Well, I'm not usually like this, I just... feel like we've been had a few times, and I don't want it to happen again. Yeah... She did bite this one guy once, though. -Get outta here! -Yeah... matter of fact, he was just about your size. Ow...! Oh, cut it out! Hi Kenny, I'm Baby, how are you? -I'm alright, and I miss you. -That's our daughter. Ah! Ah, you look good. -Hi, Mummy, hi Daddy. Hi. Hi. Hi. How are you? I'm okay. Sharon Kay, this is... Phil. -Hi. -Hello. Pleased to meet you, Sharon Kay. You are very pretty... prettier than I imagined, and I have a lot of imagination. And this is my Mum and Dad. This is Phil, He's the director of the show. -Hello, Madame. -Glad to know you. -Mister... -Hi there. Looking for a young promising star for your movie? I'm your man. -Why not? Dad, Phil has a lot of work to do today. Yeah! yeah, yeah... Sorry to be late, but... but with Sharon Kay, it's the kind of thing we expect. Well, I ain't... I mean I'm not gonna be late no more, because I'm gonna be living here during the shoot. Well, we'll see... I'm sure you'll find a way to be late, anyway. Grandpa, don't... I can't believe you just said that. Don't embarrass me like that You guys, will you just be quiet and let Phil do his job. No, no, take your time, whenever you're ready. But if it's okay with you. I would like Sharon Kay to come with me. -Right now? -Yes please. Yeah, this way. Do you believe he's gonna make Sharon Kay and Kenny cook dinner tonight. No...! It's not funny! It would be nice if you could talk a little bit. Sure... great. We did pretty good on the food, huh! Yep! We're great cooks. Sharon Kay, what I would like you to do in this is... If you could hold your brother Kenny by the hands, and have like a... a little, you know, a little dance here What's the matter with them guys? What do you mean? They haven't paid any attention to me since I came home from school. Don't worry about it, it's only the first day. Yeah, but still, I'm the one who should be over there, not Sharon Kay. They probably don't want to take a picture of that... sour puss look, you've got on your face all the time. Shut up. It's the truth. -I still wanna give it a chance. A little bit... up and, up and down, but slowly, slowly. Oh, no...! I'm getting dizzy... in the head. Did Billy tell you that I want you to be in the movie? Of course he told me. He always gives me your messages, he wouldn't forget that. -Oh, yeah! -Yeah. Don't you know who's the best friend anybody could ever get? Drives me crazy sometimes, but I always get your messages. I don't know what you did to him, but he sure likes you. I wish you'd get married, I'll see him tomorrow. Wow, wait a minute! You've planned enough for me. It's the kind of thing I've got to make my own decision about. Okay... it looks like we're almost ready. Kenny, you know what would look really good... is if you put your head on your sister's shoulder... -Like this? -Yes, and a gentle swing... please. -Okay. -Okay. I'm beginning to like that guy. I pledge allegiance to the flag... of the United States of America. and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Here, let me show you, you just, start with here... and then touch this. No, not both together. -What's his name? -His name's Shadow. Shadow. -What's up? -Why's he talking to that mean man? Oh, because of his dobermans You see, Louis Philip is just crazy about them. He's got several in Paris. And when he saw them yesterday, well he... he felt great. I'll bet that family's making a bundle off the kids back. I wonder what they find so interesting in that little cripple. Anyway, I'm getting sick of these stangers around here. Coupé... No, I wouldn't say that. I'd say he's just like any other kid, except for his legs, you know, the leg handicap. He's an okay kid to have around. Well actually, I think people around here are real proud... that Kenny's getting so much attention from all over the world. It's really exciting for all of us, he's a nice little kid. I talk to him everyday when he goes to the store. He shops for his mother, and he's a real nice little boy. I really like him. Kenny! Look at the camera. A little more... a little more closer to the dog. Sit. -Sit Tina! -Now... cheese. - Hi. -How are you doing. -Alright. -I talked to the coach today. You did! Yeah, he said everything looks good for the Steelers. Alright! Hi. -Hey, that was quick. -What do yo mean that was quick? I learned my lesson, I ain't gonna be late no more. -You hear that, Ken? -Yeah, I heard. -I don't believe it. -Me either! What! If it's true, that's one good thing about this TV stuff. -Yeah. -Get out... -Well, gotta go. -Alright, see you later. Bye. Alright. There you go...! A little bit more. Very good. Coupé! Perfect. Everybody was very good. I wish Kenny was smiling a little bit. What is the matter with you? You don't like your new legs? -They're very convincing. -I thought so too. I don't understand why you have such a sad face. -You don't? -No, I don't, I really don't. I think you should be jumping with joy. Doctor Harper, how can I jump with joy? When I'm stuck with these dead sticks. Come on, Kenny... you've been handicapped too long to be acting this way. You were supposed to have adjusted to your handicap a long time ago. Handicapped! What do you mean, handicapped? I can do anything that anybody wants me to do. If I was handicapped, it's because of these damned legs! When Kenny was born, his legs were very under developed and useless. He was also suffering from sacral agenesis, which is a genetic disorder which leaves a gap... in the spine, between the chest and the lower body. When Kenny was 6 months old, we removed the remnants of his legs. We took the shin bone and attached it to the chest, to the rib cage, and to the pelvis. And this gave support so that he could now sit up, and also gave protection for the liver and the kidneys, which, up to this point had been exposed. Can we expect to see Kenny wearing his legs all the time, and also walking normally? I'd have to say no to both of those questions. First, it would be just too physically demanding... to have Kenny carry around that much weight all day long. While secondly... well, I'll have to admit that the main purpose of the legs... is not to make Kenny walk normally, it's... just to make him appear less noticeable. Ah... In reality, the best thing would be for Kenny to wear his artificial legs, while sitting in his wheelchair. You know Kenny, you shouldn't take it so hard, they're all doing it for your own good, I'm sure of that. And how do they know better than me, what's good for me? They're adults, they have experience at this kind of thing. And they all care for you. I don't wanna be stuck in a wheelchair, or trying to keep my balance on 2 long legs. I don't wanna hide either. Why should I feel bad about myself? It sounds damned good to me. Let's hurry up, we have a very good light. What are they doing? It looks like they're trying to get her up there. Quiet please! Please be quiet. Thank you. Action! Sharon Kay, when you first saw your brother, what was your reaction? Billy! -Now, what were you saying? -I was just saying, that I didn't have much choice but to tell them... you're a good little brother like everybody else did. Look over there. -What? -Grandpa's here. So what? He's here every 2 or 3 days. I think I should talk to them while they're all in the same room. Talk about what? Wait a minute Kenny, this is important. Are you sure you want to jump into this right away? I mean, this is a really big decision and... there's no sense rushing it. I made a decision, and... I just think it would be better to talk to them now, than... when they come pick me up, it'll be less of a shock. What? Yeah, maybe but... I dunno. I think so. I'll call you later. Will you do me a favour? Stay down here with Billy for a little while, I need to talk to Mommy and Daddy and Grandma and Grandpa alone. -Okay? -Yeah. Thank you. -See you. -Yeah. What does she want to talk to them about? It's a secret, I can't tell you. If it's a secret, how come you know? See, she needed somebody to talk to about it, and she couldn't talk to you, because it dealt with you, more or less. -But can't you tell me a little thing? -I can't tell you. It'd be better if you heard it from her, anyway. Are you gonna be alright? Yeah. -Do you wanna go over there? -Yes. What do you wanna do when we get over there? We could talk about it when we get there. -Eddy, come here. -What! -It's important. -Get outta here. Come here, I've got good news. You'd better go. Sharon Kay isn't going back to Grandpa's, She's coming home to live with us. -You're not putting me on, are you? -Are you kidding? -What did Mom say about this? -She said it was okay, that's why I'm here. Go home and I'll catch you later. You better not be pulling my leg. He's coming, he's coming, he's here. Why are you back? Did you get in a fight with your friends? No, what are you talking about? Are you staying, or what? -Are you staying? -Yeah, I'm staying. I got tired of trying to explain to them French TV people, why I wasn't living with two cool brothers of mine. I figured I'd move in. Well, I'd be ready for the next bunch. -Eddy! -Do it. -Eddy! -Come on. Good idea, huh, Ken? Just a little bit more Kenny, please -Come on. -It won't be very long... Good idea, huh, Ken? -Come on, you can do it. -I can't swim. Yes you can, come on. Just 2 seconds, please. Two little seconds. No, the other way, the other way. Come on, Eddy, you know better than that. Shut up. Coupé! Excellent. Excellent, very good. You can watch, behind the camera, but we're not going to use you in this. Well... you know, Kenny's really no different than any other kid who comes down to the pool. He's a cheerful active kid, although he tires quickly. And I suppose I have to... watch a little more carefully when he's around, but... that's okay. We all love him around here. He's a good kid. He's a great kid. He's a great kid. Kenny, come on, let's go home. I don't wanna stay here no more. -Is it over? -I don't know, and I don't care. -What's wrong? -Look at that pretty boy. Who? The life guard. Who's that guy. I never saw him before. How come they're filming him, and they ain't filming me. Hell, they're always doing strange things. I'm getting sick and tired of it. Look at that jerk with Sharon Kay. I wish Billy was here. Yeah, I can dig that. Let's go home. -Kenny, hold on. -What are you gonna do? Crazy! This is, this is... you're insane, man. You're crazy, man. Very, very crazy. Are you looking for a drink? It's not that I don't want to do it, but I just don't think we will have the time for that. Hey Kenny, are you listening to me? Yeah... We have so many things to shoot tomorrow at the graveyard, and then we have to rush to catch our plane. It won't take so long to get there. Oh... here's Robert. I'm gonna take off now, he's gonna show me the town. This is my last night, okay? -Hey, can I get a ride? -Sure. Come along. Hello, Robert. Okay. -Sharon Kay, are you coming home? -Later. Now, I'm all yours. Merde! -Hi. -Hi. -We're still on for tonight, right? -Sure, I guess so. We're just about wrapped up here, huh? Eh... you may be right. I'll see you tomorrow. Move over! Drop me off at home. What do you mean, I thought you were staying with me? I can't believe you can't see what you just did. You're such a dumb jock. Because I wouldn't let you embarrass me no more You're certainly dumb enough to. I had to play along with your stupid game. Games... what are you talking about? Huh... you know damn well what I'm talking about. You and that little sneak. You little shit! -Wait a minute... -No, you wait a minute. You're always following me around, minding my business instead of yours. You can't even take care of yourself, what the hell is your problem? This has nothing to do with him, leave him out of it. You don't know what your talking about, okay. Here I am, and this cute French guy is interested in talking to me. And you two come along and screw the whole thing up. And you think that that's all he wanted to do, is talk to you. So what if he wanted more? I'm old enough to do what I want. You'd have acted the same way if it was me interupting you... with that French girl. Just take me home! I guess that wasn't one of our better moves. Yeah... Maybe you should stay with me for a while. Alright. Because I don't think you should go up there yet. -Hi. -Hi. -Hey -Huh. Can't you come see us for 5 minutes out of your day. I'm too tired, I wanna go to sleep. Kenny, come here. What happened? Did you have a fight with your sister already? No, not really. Well, what really. Well, just made a mistake. Me and Billy, we just made a mistake, that's all. And that's how come she's so mad, huh? Yeah. Hello, room 411 please. Hi Alain? It's Sharon Kay. I was afraid you were gonna go straight back to your hotel. No... No, I decided not to go out for that drive. But if you want we can still have drinks at that restaurant. In 30 minutes? No, that's okay. I really feel like taking a walk right now. Okay... I'll see you then. Bye. That's quite an outfit you've got on there. What's that supposed to mean? I would like you to go into your room... Don't be too late. I'm going out with one of those French men. You never know with them. Don't get wise with me, young lady! I ain't getting wise. I'm just letting you know what's going on, so that little sneak don't go and report it to his good friend. Okay? Bye. Morning, everybody. Okay, you guys should get downstairs, because they're all waiting for you. -Hey! -Huh. I don't know for how long you'll be staying in this house. But as long as you do, you'll obey the rules. And one rule is, everybody's supposed to come home at night. This is where you sleep. Your Dad is not gonna stay up all night and worry like he did last night, ever again! Do you here me! I'm sorry. I'd have called if I had known that he was gonna do that. You should have thought. You just don't God damned care! I do so, care. Look I'm sorry. Go on, they're waiting on you. Coupé! C'est dans la boîte. Splendid. Very good. And we're moving very quickly, so it looks like we have time for the interview with you, Eddy. We're going to do it up the hill, okay? I just don't wanna do it if Kenny's around. What's wrong, you got something against me? I just don't wanna do it if you're around. -Chicken! -Come on, come on... Ah, Kenny, please, when we do the interview, will you stay away from us, just for a little while? He's around when I'm being filmed. Please... Eddy, can you tell us what it feels like to have a brother without legs? I've never had a brother with legs, so I don't know. Is it frustrating to you not to be able to run with him... or to play football like if he was a normal brother? No. Do you spend much time playing with him? Yeah. What is your relationship with your sister? I'm closer to my sister than I am my brother. Why are you closer to your sister than your brother? Because my brother takes too much advantage of other people. What do you mean by that? Is he very demanding? Does he take advantage of other people? Yes. Is anybody teaching him to be different? No. Do you try sometimes to tell him? Yeah, but he don't listen. Coupé! Come on, we'll do that stuff again. No, no, it was great Eddy, come on. What did you say? -None of your business. -It is my business! Because you're talking about me behind my back. Oh Kenny, calm down please. He said very nice things. -Actually he said he loves you. -He did? I don't know what I said, man. The camera was running, you're nervous, so you don't know. You know what guys?

I kinda likes that script girl. Janet's brother's taking me to our apartment in pittsburgh. I'm gonna stay there until I can find one of my own. Okay, child. It's just not gonna work out here. And it's ripping the whole family apart. And I don't wanna do that. I'm sorry, I really tried. It's just too late. It just really isn't right. She doesn't belong. Sharon Kay! Sharon Kay, wait a minute. -What's the matter? -Don't do this to me Eddy. I already made up my mind. I ain't going back. But 2 days ago you wanted to stay and now you're leaving. Didn't you hear what I said upstairs? It ain't gonna work. Besides Mom has only ever cared about you and Kenny, anyway. I'm just a pain. Bullshit! Wait a minute. Where are you going? Give yourself time to try it. I don't need time to try it. I've been independent too long, Eddy. I've been living away from home too long. I couldn't take it and Mommy definitely couldn't take it. Yeah, but she loves you. I know she loves me. That's why I gotta go, before I mess anything else up. Brian's waiting for me and I don't wanna be late, I gotta go. Give me your bags and I'll walk with you. It might not be so bad. I'll have my own apartment and you can come visit, and we can talk all by ourselves. You mean, I could live with you after I quit school? You mean you still wanna quit school? Yeah. Well, what did Daddy say about it? He says I'm a dumb ass and I should finish school. -Well, he's right. -Oh yeah! How about you, when you quit school? Hey, that's different. -No, it's not. -It is too! I'm getting a part time job and I'm going to modeling school. -Oh, sure... -What? It is different. Besides Alain said I'd be a real good model. -Oh, yeah... -Yeah, so! What did Billy say about this? Why do you even bring him up? I don't wanna talk about him anymore, alright? Okay. Well, couldn't you stop her? No, I couldn't stop her, but who gives a shit. -I do, that's who. -Too bad. I couldn't have done nothing, you couldn't have done nothing. No one could have done nothing. I'm going home. I think I'm gonna take a little walk. You wanna come? No. I'll stay here with Kenny. Okay. Mom, you think Sharon Kay will come back? No, baby, she won't Can't you bring her back? No. I think it was over... with her... a long time ago. But we just didn't want to face it. Aren't you sad. Of course I'm sad. And Daddy's sad too. That don't matter. She can't live with us no more. Why? Why can't she live with us? Kenny... I can't explain it to you. You'll see why some day. It was all going so well. I don't know what happened. Kenny! Come on, right here. -Where are you going? -To the store. I gotta get cigarettes for Pam.

Yeah, I suppose I should've called you. Ace. What are you up to? Nothing. Nothing. Yeah... I guess I sort of made my mind up about something. I mean... I don't know about you... I've just about had it with this shit, these people. Nothing goes on in this town except... things that shouldn't be going on. So... I'm going to get outta here. And them books is gonna help? Well, if you wanna do something besides sweeping floors, you... gotta learn a few things. Mom? Mom, can I go to pittsburgh tomorrow with Cathy's father? -Can I go too? -No, you stay home. I wanna go too! Mom, he's waiting for an answer down there. Yeah, sure. So... getting out. Yup... Why can't you ever take me with you? I don't need no God damn chaperone. I won't bother you and Cathy. I'll go and see Sharon Kay by myself. Oh sure, and have her get pissed off at me! Why do you say that? She'll be happy to see me. Sure, but I'm not gonna take that chance. Anyway it's Cathy's father who offered me a ride, and not my whole family. I'm going to sleep. All right, all right. Okay! Hey, what's up? Oh, it's you. What are you doing here so early? What do you mean early? It's ten o'clock. Ten o'clock? Yes, ten o'clock. What's wrong with you? You haven't been doing any serious training for over a week. I guess I haven't been feeling too well, and... I have a few things on my mind. -Sharon Kay, huh? -Yeah, maybe but... let's leave her out of this. You just worry about your football, and maybe things will be better with Sharon Kay. Yeah, maybe. Just worry about your training. Alright, alright... Come on, come on, let's go, let's go... Alright, alright... Come on, you wimp. Let's go! Let's go... alright, go... Come on, let's go! Hurry, hurry... Come on, faster! Back, back, back! Come on, now. Come on! Alright, easy! Not so... Now, come on... Let's go! Where did Kenny go? What? Kenny's not in the house. -What time is it? -6:15. Well, get some clothes on and go outside and look. Alright. -What's going on? -Kenny's not in the house. Well, man. Let me tell you... you're really something else. I'm not sure if it's a good move, but I'll give it a hell of a try. Alright! I don't know. That's what I'm telling you Mom. He wasn't here this morning. -He didn't say nothing to nobody. -He took his skateboard. His skateboard isn't there Yeah, Billy and Eddy got their friends out now, looking. Look, all I want, is you call me if you see him. Okay... bye. End of the line. Everybody out. -Okay, now you take care of yourself. -Alright. -See you. -Alright. Hi! Kenny! What are you doing here? Wait a minute. Come on in. Where's Sharon Kay? She works from 6 to 10 at Ritzy's. Kenny, what's going on? Billy just called, freaking out, saying that you had disappeared or something. Everybody's out looking for you. Don't worry about it. Cathy's father just called my house. What does Cathy's father have to do with it? He brought me here. Is he going to take you home too? Yeah. Well, Sharon Kay should be here at about 10:30. I have to leave for work, now. You can wait here if you want to. No, that's alright. I'll just go and walk around. Kenny, I don't think it's safe for you to walk around by yourself. If it's safe for you, then it's safe for me. But this isn't West Aliquippa. I know, but I can take care of myself. We may not be very rich, but there's no problems like that in our family. We don't drink, and Kenny is not the kind of boy to run away either. But it seems he did this time. Well, maybe. But then why don't you go out and look for him, instead of asking me questions about my family? Thank you. Good morning. -Oh my God, are you okay? -I'm fine. What's going on here? Now look, you've got to be more careful. Ah, excuse me sir. It really wasn't her fault. I often surprise people. Well, thank you for your understanding. Can I take your order? -Sure. Get in the house, come on. Sit down! What is the matter with you? Everybody is looking for you, even the cops are looking for you. Why do you always get in trouble to get peoples attention. Can't you do anything like everybody else? That's what I want, but nobody won't let me. Of course they won't. How's anybody gonna trust you, if you keep doing stupid shit! It's the first time I did something like this. I had to talk to you. Talk to me? If it's about getting back with Billy or coming home... You wasted your time, I can tell you that right now. That's not why I came here. We know you won't come back home. That's for sure. And don't try to make me feel guilty about it neither. Hey, you made me feel guilty all my whole life... for not being a good sister to you. I'm not trying to make you feel guilty. I don't wanna blame you. I want to get to know you better. I want to know why you came home and left so quickly. I want to know why you left 12 years ago. Is it because I don't have no legs? I need to know these things. What do you want to know that for? Is it gonna make you feel better to know that I don't care about you! or anybody else in the family, huh? Will it? Yeah. I'll know what to do, the next time I'll see you. Okay. Okay, you got it. It is because of you, all of it. What do they expect from me, anyway? I was only 5 years old. And I just wanted a cute little baby to play with. And you know what I got? I got you! I mean, I didn't scream or cry or nothing when I saw you, I was in shock. I didn't even say nothing because I couldn't, it hurt too much inside. Why wasn't my kid brother just like every other little baby? Now, Mommy and Daddy couldn't even pay attention to me no more, because they were too busy taking care of you. Oh, I had good reasons to start hating you. Oh, I hated you so much, it scared me. Yeah, well I couldn't help it. I thought there was something wrong with me... for being such a bad little girl. So I left. And then I started hating myself, and then it just got worse! You wanna hear more about my non existent brother and sister relationship, do you? I have a right to be happy, and to love myself. And you messed me up until now. But no more! You made me lose my Mommy's love. A chance to be with her while I was growing up, and you know what, that's gone now. And I can't ever get it back. Ever! Are you satisfied! Oh, I can't even look at you anymore. Just get out of my house! Get out of my life! Kenny! Kenny, come back! Oh, Kenny! I didn't mean it! Kenny, stop! Kenny! Damn it! Kenny! Kenny! Kenny! Wait, damn it! Kenny! Shit! Where are you, damn it! Oh, I didn't mean it. Kenny, I didn't mean it, I'm sorry! Sharon, no! Sharon! I'm over here! Sharon! Oh, Kenny! Oh, Kenny! Kenny, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, come here. Believe me... I'm so sorry. Are you okay? -Yeah. I didn't mean anything I said, I swear. I do need you... # There's a strange look, # in your eyes for me. # Such a far away look, # in a distant kinda light. # Got to get a... # somewhere you wanna go. # Gonna cruise the galaxy highway. # Got your eye on a distant light, # far on a distant land. # You've got a real look, # in your eyes tonight. # Such a feel look, # in a truthful kinda light. # Whoa, soaring baby. # Morning lazy, as you roll out to the road. # Soaring baby... # ... when you arise. # Then you rise... # Then you rise, # far above the highway. # Rise and rise... # to a higher plane. # And when you come in for a landing... # There's a warm look, # in your eyes tonight. # Such a lonely look, # a warming kind of light.
