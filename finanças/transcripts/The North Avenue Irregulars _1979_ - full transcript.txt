Ooh, it's so pretty. Yeah. Let's go look. God? Are you home? Dean! Well, Dad always says it's god's house. Let's go look around. Okay. I wonder what's up there. You better get down. You're gonna get in trouble. Dean! Okay. Yeow! Whoa! Whoa! - Help! - Dean! Help! Somebody help me! Help me! Rose! That sounds like your husband, Mrs. Rafferty. Help! Where are you? That's Delaney, all right. Now what is he up to? Help! Help! Hey, that's someone in trouble. What did you do? Nothing. Gangway! Delaney, what are you doing up there? You're supposed to be painting. Rose, now, don't start. - Don't you yell at me. - Don't jump, Mr. Rafferty. You've got lots to live for. You think I don't know that? Why doesn't somebody get a ladder? - There's one out back. Okay, come on. - I'll give you a hand. You can stop your hollering, Delaney. They're coming for you. Hurry, hurry. Me hands are... Has anybody called the fire department? There's a phone in the office. - Gangway! - Come on! Come on! Hang on. We got the ladder. Hang on! It's coming up. - Stop kicking around! You'll tire yourself out! - It's too short. Maybe we should take the ladder up to the belfry and lower it down to him. Hey, that's a good idea. Yeah, do that. Take that down. - Everybody, push. - Where are you going now? Well, can't you get the cat out of the tree later? Well, a man's life is in danger. Forward! Forward! Go back. Back up. It's the North Avenue Presbyterian Church. Hurry! Hurry! That's the way to go. - Honey! - Go back! Go back! Hold on! They're coming! Hold on! - Somebody, get around. - Move it! Hurry up, you two! Sorry. Sorry. Ouch. Sorry. Ow! Sorry. That ain't gonna make much of a cushion. Hey, you with the flowered shirt. Could you just take the end there? - Sure. - Hang on, Delaney! Grab on to the ladder, Mr. Rafferty. - Pull me up. - Okay. Ready? Pull. - Oh, I can't look. I can't look. - Help! Somebody help! Delaney! Delaney! Grab on to the ladder! Help, somebody! The other side. The other side. Rose, the will is in the top drawer! - Is he all right? - Is he all right? Can you see anything? Rosie! Rosie! Delaney! Delaney! Me poor darlin'! Are you all right? Thanks to you, Rosie, me darlin'. Ah! Don't touch me. You're a mess. Where's Dad? Dad! Dad, are you all right? Dad! Are you all right? Who's he? I'm Reverend Hill, your new pastor. Oh, he's the new pastor. Glory be! It's the new pastor. I hope you were praying for me when I was up there. Welcome to New Campton, Reverend. I'm Cleo Jackson. I hope he feels all right. Look, we tried to be on time. It was just an awful mistake. The whole thing, from start to finish. I volunteer voluntarily, except I have baby-sitting problems. Would you please let him get his hat off before you start that? Reverend Hill, I'm Claire Porter. How do you do? Well, you know, we didn't expect you till tomorrow. We would've had a less hectic reception if we'd known. Would you happen to have a little of that sacramental wine on the premises, Reverend? Sacramental. Watch your hands. You wanna get paint all over the Reverend's chair? Haven't you done enough for one day? Please, let's go home and get you cleaned up. Rosie, you're straining me patience. Oh, I'll strain more than that. - Isn't this nice? - Very... nice. - Oh, that must be Howard. - Howard? My fiance. I told him I'd be waiting for him out front. If-if-if you get a chance, please check your calendar, because we're getting married June 25, and we'd like you to perform the ceremony. - Oh, thank you. That's... - It's really been... Oh, sorry. - It's really been a pleasure meeting you. Bye. - Bye. I have to dash too. It's been terribly nice. I have to pick up my children... And I have to get my dog Bruno out of the vet. They charge an extra day if I leave him in there after 4:00. He was, uh, foaming at the mouth. Well, Saint Bernards do. But, uh, it was quite an excessive amount. I think it was just an oral problem. Nothing rabid. Well, good-bye. - My, you're a tall one. - Come on, Claire. I do believe our dear Reverend has a lot to do and can use the time. See you later, Annie. Have a nice day. Come on, darlin'. You'll see him another day. You'll see him in church. Good-bye. Good-bye. - Quite a group. - Yes, they are. - Oh. Oh, I'm-I'm Anne Woods. - How do you do? Here's the list of the church membership. Minutes of the meetings for the last couple of months. That's my office right out there. If you have any questions... Unless, of course, you have plans to hire a new secretary. No, no. I feel very fortunate to have you stay on. Oh, well, then, in case... Here is... The key to the outside door. Um, these are the, uh, Presbyterian financial reports, the sinking fund, which is emergency money, um, the men's club book and, uh... Is anything the matter? It's very difficult for me... Having a stranger take over at North Avenue. But, Miss Woods, you must understand that I didn't ask your father to retire. - Oh, I know. - I only applied for the job. Of course I know that. It... it's just that... This church was our... Was his life. Yes, there's, uh... There's plenty of evidence of that. Either you or Reverend Woods chaired most of the committees. Someone had to do it. Yes. But I think active participation by the whole membership... Is what really makes a strong church. In fact, I've got a lot of plans along those lines for this church. I think you'll find if you want something done here... That it's easier to do it yourself. Then that way, you'll know when it gets done. Oh, I'm sure there are a lot of people who would like to help, given the chance. Good luck. Oh! Pardon me, Reverend. Delaney left his hat. Oh, here it is. Ah, I'm-I'm sorry. Very sorry. Ah, excuse me, Mrs... Oh. Rafferty. Mrs. Rafferty. - I wonder if you could help me with something. - Help? You? Me? Oh, why, anything. Anything I can do. Anything. How would you like to be in charge of the, uh... The church sinking fund. In charge? Uh... uh, Reverend Hill. Oh, I'd like it. In fact, I'd love it. There you are, madam chairman. And we thank you. Thank you. - Uh, Mrs. Rafferty? - Yeah? Start thinking about ways of building up the fund. Of course I will. Sure. Why not? Why, uh, good-bye.

I remember, Mrs. Rafferty, but I can't discuss it now. Excuse me. He bet it on a 7-1 shot he says is wired. He what? Delaney bet it all on Sundae Treat to win in the third at Aqueduct. Your husband put it all on... Your husband bet the whole $1,206... On a horse race? How could he do such a thing? He... well... well... - Where did he make the bet? - One of the bookies downtown. - Come with me. - ♪ A... ♪ Jephthah, the soldier, was a man of mighty valor.

Reverend, what are you gonna do? Stop that bet. We'll take the bike. It's faster. Here. Put that on. Yes, sir. Get on, Mrs. Rafferty. All right, I'm getting on. You all set? I think so. Ah! What's going on? Where is this bookie? I don't know which one he used. There's more than one? Lots. Carlucci's Bakery, the pet store on Friar... And the orthopedic shoe store. Ortho... But I'll lay you 8-1 he used Harry, The Hat. Harry, The Hat? Right. Mrs. Rafferty, hang on! Pull in right here. There's Harry's place. Harry? It says Sam. Are you sure? I'm sure. You better hurry. It's almost post time. Throw 'em on the back of the chair. Are you Harry? Nope. Sam. Sam. I knew it. What Harry did you want? Harry. The hat. Uh-huh. In the back. - Hold it. Your pants. - What? Pants pressed while you wait. It's part of my deal with Harry. - Well, all I wanna do is talk to him. - No exceptions. Get 'em off. Ridiculous. I have to take my pants off. - Here you are. - Ah, better pay now while you still got the 50 cents. Yeah. In the pants. Oh, yeah. Oh, you didn't get a vision or anything, did you, padre? Which one is Harry? Harry. Oh, that's Harry right there. Uh, Harry. Oh, don't worry, father. All our players enjoy complete anonymity. It's Reverend. And I'm not concerned about anonymity. I'm concerned about $1,206 of our church's money... That a parishioner bet, here. So that's where Delaney got that kind of dough. And you want it back, right? Right. Look, father, my advice is let it ride. Sundae Treat's the horse to beat. And at 7-1, you'd really hate yourself if she comes in, right? All I want is to get the money back. The horses are at the post. And they're off! It's Sundae Treat, our Travis, Bengal Boy, Sony, Miss Snoop, Bags, Rags and Ready Teddy. It's Sundae Treat, Our Travis, Bengal Boy moving on the outside. Bengal Boy! Come on, Bengal Boy! It's Sundae Treat, Bengal Boy. Come on, Sundae Treat! Sundae Treat. That's my horse. Come on, Sundae Treat! Come on! And it's Sundae Treat. Sundae Treat! Come on, Sundae Treat! It's Sundae Treat by a neck. Come on, boy! Bengal Boy! Sundae Treat, Bengal Boy. As they head for the finish, Bengal Boy and Sundae Treat. They cross the wire, and it's Bengal Boy! Bengal Boy! So, maybe you can make a comeback in the next race. Guiding light looks good at six furlongs. I want that money back. And if I don't get it, I will go straight to the police. We don't want any trouble. I mean, it's bad for business. You know what I mean? Hey, Charley. Yeah? You remember the wad that Delaney put on Sundae Treat? Yeah. Well, it turns out the dough belongs to the bishop here. It belongs to the north Avenue Presbyterian Church. And it's Reverend. Well, see if you can work something out. Uh, not here. It turns out I'm giving money back, they'll start a stampede. You know what I mean? We'll take care of it. All right. Let's step out here. Hey, open up! Hey! Hey, listen! I'm gonna get every cent back... Hey, Mac, everybody else loses their shirts in there. But, mother Carlisle, it was brief and to the point. - It was a disgrace. - I have never been so... How come he doesn't have any pants on? Well, we... We don't know why. We... we don't question why. Why don't we? Are we all supposed to pretend he has pants on when he doesn't? Mm-hmm. Yes. Morning. Morning. It's hard to believe this sort of activity's taking place right here in the center of town. Well, this will make a believer out of you, Captain. It's right here. It's this way, Captain. Just a minute, Reverend. Are you the owner here? Yes, sir. Search warrant. It's right back here. Sam, would you mind? Mind what? The d... Are you sure you're in the right place, Reverend Hill? I'm sure. And if we'd come right over when I lodged the complaint, you would've seen for yourself. Well, this is America. You can't just barge into a business and arrest people... Because somebody said so. We'd be infringing on civil rights. I don't need a lecture on civil rights from you, Captain. And I know of at least three other illegal gambling spots in this same area. Well, give me those addresses. I'll get the necessary warrants right away. It's obvious we're wasting each other's time. I have work to do. And I'm sure you do too, whatever it is you do. Well, we'll look into it further. And if we come up with anything, we'll call you. As part of this station's public service programming, we invite the pastors of New Campton's churches... To address us on "Words To Live By." This evening's message is brought to us by the Reverend Michael Hill... Of the North Avenue Presbyterian Church. Another day is closing. But Revelation 22 tells us that there shall be no night, and they need no candle, for the lord giveth them light. And I... And I'm-I'm sorry. But there won't be much light in New Campton... If we don't face another Revelation... Of more immediate concern to all of us. I... I've just moved to New Campton, and my family and I were delighted with what we saw. But it was revealed to me today... That our town is plagued, plagued by large-scale illegal gambling. It was made clear to me that this criminal element... Works hand in glove with your own police force. Hold it. Leave it on. A complaint by a citizen... Does not result in the arrest of the guilty... But in the humiliation of the citizens foolish enough to register a complaint. If this condition is so obvious to me, then the people of New Campton cannot possibly be ignorant of it. Well, it doesn't take an expert to see... That large-scale gambling can steadily and systematically... Drain a town of its resources. The money that's gambled and lost here does not recycle in our town. It funnels into the hands of criminals and crime bosses. This money is then used to support other forms of organized crime, like bribing city management and police officials. Way to go, Rev. You tell 'em. Tell em? He's askin' for it. If our police and elected officials cannot or will not rid our community... Of these... these parasites, then they should be replaced by people who will. Thank you. And god bless you. - You have just heard "Words To Live By"... - Shut it off. That's the same guy, Mr. Roca. Maybe I should've given his dough back. - It'll blow over. - So how long do I gotta stay closed? You can open up tomorrow. We'll keep the preacher in line. Thank you, Mr. Roca. North Avenue Presbyterian Church. May I help you? Who should I say is calling? Reverend, it's another threat for you. - Forget it. - I'm sorry. He's not taking threats without names. Hello. Has the committee head meeting started yet? - Uh, maybe later. - These are for you. Aren't they beautiful? Would you excuse us, Mrs. Porter? We're in the middle of a meeting. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Put them in this vase. They're just lovely. All right, Anne, where were we? It boggles the mind that you have the unmitigated gall... To use this church as-as-as a soapbox for your self-serving ambitions. Self-serving? I merely put out the word... That New Campton is being systematically ripped off by gamblers. - Rubbish. - Our own church has lost over $1,200. Exactly. And how did it get lost? - Will somebody answer that, please? - I'll get it. Hello. North Avenue Presbyterian Church. Who? Uh, just a minute, please. - Dr. Fulton. - Who is Dr. Fulton? The Presbyterian executive. Excuse me, ladies. Excuse me. Huh? Please? Dr. Fulton, what a pleasure to hear from you. I'll come right to the point, Reverend Hill. General council feels that prayer on television is intended to be just that. It is not intended as a forum for politicking or mudslinging. I assure you, Dr. Fulton, that was not the talk I had prepared. It was just a spur-of-the-moment thing, prompted by my experiences of yesterday. Dr. Fulton, they have a real problem in this town. - Such matters are not your concern, Reverend Hill. - They're not? Now, in the future, we suggest you concentrate your efforts... On revitalizing North Avenue and increasing the membership. Well, I... I had planned to go out this afternoon and do that very thing. Uh, well, if you don't drive, perhaps your son could bring you. We'd like to see you both at church. My son thinks you're some kind of a nut. Oh. Well, I have some appointments this afternoon. It's been nice talking to you, Mr. Younger. I understand you were once one of our most active members, Mrs. Gossin. Well, my ex was kind of a Jesus freak, but when he split, I sort of lost interest. - I'm into yoga now. - I think there's room for both in a person's life, don't you? Hmm, I guess. Got time for a drink? Uh, no, I'm afraid I haven't, Mrs. Gossin. But I do hope you can make it Sunday. ♪ ♪ Okay. Hi, guys. Uh, we gave at the office. No, no, no, no. I just want to talk to you about your music. - Sure. - I, uh... I kind of have an idea. Everybody, I'd like you to meet Strawberry Shortcake. - Hi. - This is Shorty, uh, Billy, Doodles and Sam. These gentlemen have kindly consented to serve the lord... By helping us kind of, uh, hype up the crowd. - Hype it up? - Yeah, give it some pizzazz, attract some of the younger people. Younger people? Our hymns have lasted for centuries without the benefit of, uh, pizzazz. Well, the lord never asked his followers to be long-faced and doleful. He said, "happy are the people whose god is the lord." - Amen. - I think we ought to try something new. Well, that's fine, Reverend Hill. I think in that case, though, that I should turn over the choir... To Shorty here and the Shortcakes. Uh, excuse me. Hey, who is it? Get the window. Right. Say, who's there? What's going on here? What do you want? Easy, Reverend. Easy. I'm, uh, Marv Fogelman. This... I got some ID here somewhere. This is my partner here, Tom, uh, Voorhees. We're, uh... We're, uh, special investigators for the, uh, Treasury Department. - There it is. - Did you guys ever hear of a phone? Uh, thou shalt not use the telephone too much in our business, Reverend. People listen. We heard about your broadcast, Reverend Hill. We thought maybe you could give us a hand. Doing what? Breaking up the gambling organization here in New Campton. Ah, thanks, but, uh, this thing has put me on thin ice already. It could cost me my job. We don't expect you to do nothing. You're too hot to get near a gambling joint now anyway. We just want you to round up a few men you can trust, and we'll take it from there. What do you say? For god and country? Mr. Webber, they need men like you, men that are known in the community, to work with the Treasury Department... And then testify in court. Then get a rock through my window, or worse. If we can close them down, then people won't have to be afraid of things like that. I'm sorry. I've got customers. Reverend, people gamble. They always have. They always will. I'm not talking about a poker game on Saturday night or a day at the races. I'm talking about organized crime. Have you tried Bob Purcell? Mr. Purcell plays golf with the chief. He doesn't want to do anything to strain the relationship. I wish I could help you. But it's not your town anymore. It's their town. Uh... Yeah. Mm. Yes, I understand. I understand, yeah. Thanks. Thanks anyway. Yeah. Come in. Uh, Reverend Hill, we're all ready to leave now. The chairs are all folded and locked in the storeroom. The newsletters are all stamped and ready for mailing. Oh, I... I regret to inform you... That, uh, the... the Women's Association Annual Bean and Salad Supper... Will be a dollar-fifty this year... Instead of the usual dollar. Oh. Oh, that is bad news. So... Well, thank you, Claire. You've all been a great help. Oh, you're welcome. Thank you. You've all been very helpful. You've been very gracious. Thank you. - Thank you. Good night. - Bye. Good-bye. Claire. Claire. Uh, what do you do in your spare time? Oh. Well, it's just one mad world. Take tonight for instance. I'm going to see Casablanca for the eighth time, and, uh, then I'm going to dine on a peanut butter and banana sandwich, and then I will hit the feathers. It's like that every night, just frantic. How would you like to spice up your life a little? Oh, need a secretary for the Youth Activities Committee? Meet me tomorrow night at 9:00. Nine? Oh, sure. You know where I live? That's too conspicuous. Make it the Sunday School room. The Sunday School... Yeah, and make it the side entrance. Side entrance. Oh, Claire, how pretty you look. Do you look beautiful! Lovely. Claire. Ah, glad you could make it, Claire. - 'Course you know all the girls. - Of course. Hi. - Hi. - I'll get you for this. Now will you explain what we're all here for, Reverend? You all realize that New Campton is in trouble. There are some men in town that need our help. Our help? Why us? Because I think you're game and can keep your mouth shut. Keep our mouths shut? Let me out of here. I'm expecting... Sorry. Excuse us. Who was that? Just a minute. What's with the broads? I talked to over 20 men. No takers. They don't want to make waves. So you got ladies instead, Reverend? - It's either those ladies or nothing. - You made the wrong choice. No, I don't think so. At least talk to them. Me, talk? Do they know why they're here? I, uh, thought I'd let you handle that. No, don't open the door. Uh, ladies, uh, these are the gentlemen I told you about. Oh, how do you do? Hello. They work for the government. This is Marv Fogelman and Tom... Voorhees. Voorhees. Uh, what he means, uh, we're, uh, special investigators for the, uh, Treasury Department. We're looking for people... To do, uh, infiltration and undercover work... To help us break up the rackets here in New Campton. And, uh, your Reverend... Thinks that you ladies could hack it. Have any of you ladies, uh, ever made a bet with a bookie? - Ever played the numbers? - No. No, bingo. We all play bingo Friday nights. Fridays. Bingo, huh? Okay, um, let's start from square one. You see, uh, you would be, uh, expected to, uh, go... Into established gambling joints, see, and make bets. Now, if we could get two witnesses... Or if a federal officer is present when you make the bet, we could usually make it stick. Yeah. We want to build airtight cases against as many as we can. Then we lower the boom, see. If we close down enough of them, their bank dries up. Then you get your town back. You mean to say they even have a bank? Well, they call it "the bank" or "the office." It's where all the money and the bank slips go. The big man in this county is Max Roca. Well, anyhow, that's the bones of it. Uh... Yeah. Well, ladies, what do you think? I'm in. They got their hooks into my brother-in-law. He can't quit, and he can't get even. You bet I'm in. - If it keeps me from cleaning the oven, I'm game. - I'm free on Mondays. I could change my exercise class to Wednesday and take macrame on Thursday. I'd like to do my part for the government. However, do you have provisions for baby-sitting? Baby-sitting? Lady, this is... This is Tom's department. Tom will answer all your questions. Aw, Marv. Anything you want... I'm delighted to meet you. What about guns? No. No guns. I'd rather you didn't tell anybody. Think about it. Who would suspect a bunch of ding-a-ling dames? After all, it's your home, Howard. We can put a cot in your room. It's foolish to be buying a house when you don't know if it's going to work out. It'll work out just fine, mother. Jane... Jane's a wonderful girl. Then what's she doing going... in there? How's tricks? Huh? How's tricks? Oh. Fine. Um, I'll have a Margarita. One Margarita coming up. Uh, bartender, uh, put that on my tab. Well, thank you. My pleasure. Aren't you sweet? How am I doing? You live in, uh, New Campton? Oh, all my life. You from out of town? Minneapolis. We put out a line of gaskets for diesel engines. Isn't that exciting? Let's not overdo it. Oh. Um, today's my birthday. I'm 28 years old. Congratulations. - Thank you. - Here you are. One Margarita. Thank you very much. Oh, um, I'm sorry. Excuse me. I, uh, want to buy a number. I want to put, uh, ten bucks on number 281. That's one to grow on. Ten bucks on 28... Jane! - Howard! - What are you doing in here? Uh, I was, uh... Having a little refreshment. Oh, is that what they call it these days? Ask her who the man is, Howard. Who is... - Howard, I'll call you later. - Ask her who the man is, Howard. - Who is... - Howard, I'll call you later. - Who is that man? - It's just a guy. He bought me a drink. Is that a crime? I told you she wasn't right for you in the first place. Yes, mother. Maybe... maybe we should think it over, Jane. - Mm-hmm. - I'll call the church and talk to Reverend... No! Oh, Howard. Oh, why... I'm so sorry. Oh, Howard, my baby. Take your hands off him. Howie! I'm so sorry. Why did you do that? You brute! Howard, Howard, I can explain everything. I'll explain it all. I can explain it, Howard. And she hit me. What do you mean you can explain? You know what kind of a person you are? I've always wanted to do something like this. Something that would be interesting, challenging... And at the same time, a public service. You know what I mean, Tom? Yes, ma'am. There's Bootsie's place. Ooh, that's, uh... This is it. That's right. Wait a minute. What do I say? What do I say? What is it? Tell me again. When the guy comes up, you just say, "I want tickets on these numbers." I want tickets on these numbers. It doesn't matter what the combinations are... But no more than three numbers in any one group. When I come in, I say I want tickets on these combinations... I want a ticket. Of groups of... Why don't you just read it off the list I gave you? Oh, the list. The list. Can I help you? I have a special on "chrysanthenums." I want to bet a hundred groups on these tickets of three. - What? - Ah, oh... Oh... uh... ah... It's all right. I got it. Ah, I want... I want to bet a hundred tickets on this three group combination. My... my wife's a little nervous, because if she wins, we're going on our second honeymoon. Oh, yeah. We're... A hundred dollars on these numbers. Here. A hundred dollars. Wait. Here. I'll get your copy. How did I do? I've, uh, never seen anything to top it. Oh. Uh, if you lose, does the Treasury Department give you back your money? I thought so. Here's your order, lady. Oh... And next time take your business some place else. Did you have to wear that? We look like the Bobsey Twins. Or triplets. - Did you make the bet yet? - Shh. You got it. I got a tape recorder. Is it on? No. Why don't you put it on so that it'll be running... When we make the bet. Good idea. Not that way. That's reverse. What'll it be? Uh, coffee. Coffee. Figures. And a fiver on 268. My horoscope says that even numbers are going to be very lucky for me today. Fin. 268. - Did you get it? - I think so. - You better make sure. ♪ ♪- Shh. ♪ Oh, roll out the barrel ♪ ♪ We'll have a barrel of fun ♪ Yippee! ♪ Roll out the barrel ♪ ♪ We've got the blues on the run ♪ - ♪ Sing boom ta rar ra ♪ - get outta here! ♪ Ring out a song of good cheer ♪ ♪ Now's the time to roll the barrel ♪ ♪ For the gang's all here ♪ ♪ Ba da da da ba da da da ♪ Delaney told me it was a blank tape.

It is over, done with. It was a crazy idea. Not your fault. I accept full responsibility. Yeah, well, I'm sure we'll handle it better next time. We will. We'll handle it better next time. Next time? What next time? The way they fixed it, Serpico couldn't get in one of those joints. Well, what about in a couple of weeks when things cool down? Couple of weeks. They won't even know us in a couple of weeks. Thanks, but no thanks. Hey, just because we made a couple of goofs, you're not gonna bench us. We're not out of the ball game yet. I agree. Frankly, I'd like to stick it to 'em good. What did you have in mind, Tiger? Well, I don't know. I have an idea. Uh, why don't we go after that bank you told us about? Yes? You said if they dried up the bank, they'd go out of town. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Now, look, you're a gung ho bunch of dames. I like that.

First of all, my department would never spring for it. So forget it. I will spring for the radios, if you all would like to use them. Claire, that's terrific. So? Yeah. How about it? - Marv, give us a chance. - Why not? I don't know. It's like chicken soup. It won't do any good, but it couldn't hurt. I guess! This is Home Plate calling all units. Hold it! Hold it! I told youse, you can only talk one at a time. Uh, Phantom Fox. Uh, Max and I are watching Freddie, uh, Two Fingers Snooker Parlor, and, uh, I expect to be murdered any minute. If that should happen, would somebody please contact Alfredo? He does my hair. - Ten-four. - Five dames ain't ever gonna find no bank. We'll be lucky if they don't get us all killed. If you want me honest opinion, it's a wild-duck chase. Who... who... Who is that? It sounds like Delaney Rafferty. Blarney Stone, the whole idea is that they'd be less suspicious with women following them. I know. I know. But I can't drive, Reverend. And you'll never recognize Delaney. Don't use my name, I told ya. If it got out what I was doing, I'd be spending the night in the river, that's what. Them guys play for keeps. Today's cooking corner recipe is a fantasy all of us know. It's called Fairy Queen Pudding. Mmm. First you prepare four egg whites. June Bride. There's a man leaving Big Chin's with a paper bag. This could be the pickup man. Describe the suspect, please. Brown pants and a blue jacket... With red and white stripes down the sleeves. I think it's a polyester. June Bride, what is he doing now? I don't know. He's gone. He drove off. Follow him! All right. Don't shout. Of all the dumb, stupid broads! My acid is flowing. June Bride, uh, could you describe the car? Yes. It was olive green. No, maybe it was more avocado. Well, it was lighter than a forest green but not as bright as kelly green. I think we better stick with avocado. Try to locate the car, and hurry! Please. Please. I see him. He's driving a Plymouth. He's on Lexington. Okay, okay. Beautiful. That's good. - Which way on Lexington? - Towards that new boutique. She's trying to kill me. I think she means east. I'm getting stopped by a red light. Am I allowed to run it? - No, no. Stop. - Marv, kiddie car could probably pick him up. Kiddie car, come in. Please! Oh. Um... um, hello. Uh, excuse me. All right, all right, Toby, give Betty back her creepy crawlers. Toby, they're her creepy crawlers. Hold the line. Toby, you have your ray gun. You don't need her creepy crawlers. Marvin, will you tell Toby to give Betty back her creepy crawlers. I will, if you'll go to Lexington and look for a green Plymouth, and hurry. I can't. I'm not anywhere near there. You're supposed to be. I was, but I forgot today was my day to pick up the cobras. - Pick up what? - The cobras. They're six and two on the season. If they take the Tigers, they're a cinch for the play-offs. How long will it take you to get to Lexington and High Street? We can leave... Just as soon as the shortstop gets out of the boys room. Tell them all to go home. Forget it. It's all over. Listen, Marv, if he stays east on Lexington, Clunker could pick him up. Clunker? Have we had that one yet? Not yet. - Clunker, are you there? - Ready to go. Good. - Could you go to Lexington and look for a green Plymouth? - On my way. She's going. Come on, you rare beauty. Clunker, the driver is wearing a blue jacket with red and white stripes. Gotcha. Come on, baby. We gotta take a hike. Gotta help auntie Cleo. That's a precious lamb. Yes, indeed. Good boy. Good boy. Good boy. Yes, yes, yes. Here you are. Here you are. This your car? No, sir. It belongs to Classic Used Cars. My husband works there. I see. Uh, didn't you see the sign? Oh, boy. May I see your operator's license, please? Here you are, sir. Thank you. Watch it, lady. Watch it. Watch it. I got him. Good. He's not on Lexington. He's on king street. I'm right beside him. Does he still have the bag, Clunker? Clunker, does he still have the bag? Answer. Clunker, answer. I can't see. - Go to sleep for Mama. Nice baby. - What's with "go to sleep"? Can you at least get the license number? - Hey, you, lady! - Clunker, what are you doing? Will you give us the license number? Now, you listen to me. You keep quiet till I tell you, you hear? Or you'll wish you had. That's no way to talk to that infant. Butt out, lady. Hey! Hey! Hey, lady, I could cite you for evading arrest. And if that piece of junk isn't moved in five minutes, I'm gonna have it towed away and impounded. You got yourself a deal. I lost him for a moment, Home Plate, but I got him now. He's coming out of a market, and he's driving north on Crown Street. - Good. Stay with him. - Can't do it, Home Plate. I'm out of gas. - What? - Give it to Phantom Fox. Phantom Fox, he's coming your way. Move out. With pleasure. Got him, Home Plate. He stopped at the park. He's heading toward a man on a picnic table. He's sitting at the picnic table. Watch him, Phantom Fox. Every move. He has a bag. He's reaching inside the bag. He's taking out a... sandwich. He threw the bag away in the... in the garbage. Mr. Martin, please. Check okay on register number six. Hi, Mom! Hi! Hi! Hi. Why are you buying so much Cheerios? I'm not. What do you know about shopping? Go... go find your little sister. Can we get some ice cream? - Ah, yes. Don't bother Mommy now. - Thanks, Mom! Excuse me. He's still at the magazine stand. Just be patient. This is where we blew it yesterday. He keeps checking his watch and looking out the window. The other guy must be late. Keep watching him! There's another man who came in with a paper bag. This could be a pass. Everybody stay awake. They did it. They did it. They switched bags. They're leaving. Okay. Follow him. - Follow him? Which one? - The one with the bag! - They both have bags. - The newer one with the old bag. Oh, uh, yes. He's on his way out the door, and he has a plaid shirt on. I see him! Subject is a male Caucasian about, I don't know, 5'8, Sandy hair and a little paunchy. He's getting into a little white car. All units, plan "A." Look for a little, uh, white car. He's turning right on Danny. Danny Avenue. Stay with him. Stay with him. - He's speeding up, Home Plate. - You're burned. You're burned. Peel off! Peel off! Peel off! Who's got him? Who's got him? Not I, Home Plate. I peeled off as instructed. Not me. I peeled off. - We did like you told us. - Me too! I just peeled off. They all peeled off? I got him! I got him! Break for Phantom Fox. Suspect in view. - Rear view. - Phantom Fox, where are you located? I'm on... I'm on 4th street. He's right behind me. All right, now. Now, listen. Listen, slow down, let him pass you and stay with him. He's turn... He turned down the alley, down on Jefferson. That's all right. Turn around and go back. She can't turn, Marv. That's a one-way street. Phantom Fox, we'll give you instructions. You can't turn. I can't back up either. Well, I'll try. There he is, down the alley. I'll double back. All right, that's good, but do not get too close. Do not get too close. I'm terribly sorry. Are you all right? Look what you did. Are you crazy, lady? Phantom Fox, what's happening? Here, let me have that thing. Phantom Fox, if you've lost him, return to North Avenue for further... Don't say North Avenue on the thing! They'll hear you! I never could stand that show. The doctor said complete rest and quiet for a few days, but you can talk to him. Hi, Marv. How are you feeling? Wonderful. Marv, the girls and I were talking. And, uh, well, they'd like to take another shot at it. Reverend, we shot at it... Three times. Each time, it was a fiasco. My stomach isn't up to it. Claire said she'd get a radio for my office at the church. It's her money. Get two. Then I'll tell them it's okay to continue? Tell them anything you want, as long as I don't have to hear it or be there. Thanks, Marv. Hope you feel better. I'll be in touch. Don't bother. Mike, he's doing just as you said, Home Plate. He's coming back on Raymond. He's stopping. He's making a pass... To a white cable TV van. He could be the collector. Let the car go. Stay with the van. He's leaving, and I'm right behind him. Now, this can't take very long, Home Plate. It's karate day, the girls are having a recital, I'm having a tupperware party in a half hour. He's turning left... Left on victory. Bruno, out of the... What'll I do? Bruno! Bruno! Let him go. Blarney Stone, you're near. That's us! Get going! It'll take at least ten minutes from here. Oh, no, it won't. If ya can't drive, don't be touchin' the wheel! We're takin' a little shortcut. Blarney Stone, where is he? Do you copy? Blarney Stone, have you spotted him? - Where are you? - Don't ask! Get off the track! Don't yell at me! Who do you think you are? All units, we lost him. Come on in. Home Plate out. What is this? What are you doing? Are you a minister or Batman? Look at this. You've turned this into a war room. Anne... Sit down. Sit down. I've got something to tell you. I didn't mind about the... Please, sit down. The Treasury Department asked me to help them. The Treasury Department? They came to me. They need us. Why? Chasing criminals has nothing to do with you or North Avenue. The police are paid to do that. Oh, the police. In this town? Yes. Anne, you said it yourself. Somebody has to do it. If the church is not a moral force in the community, then it's just another building with stained glass windows and a steeple. But you are meddling in something dangerous with all this. I think the only thing you're gonna accomplish in the end... Is-is harm to the church. Yes, but they're actually making headway. Those women, in their own crazy way, are giving the mob fits. If we can just hang in there, we can put a crimp in their operation, maybe stop it altogether. We get closer every day. Today, I think we found the collector. You're all risking your lives... Well, that-that's it. I'll have no part of any of that. I resign as your secretary. And I'm going to go to the executive committee and tell them why. - Anne. - What? I do understand how you feel, but I don't know what else to do.

For happy are the people... Whose god is the lord. Amen! What are they trying to do? Find the bank, close us down. Do they all work for Hill? One of 'em we know goes to his church. Hill isn't an ordinary guy off the streets. We hit him, the papers get in on it, the cops have to do a number. Well, they're slowin' up the work, sir, and things are gonna get worse if we don't do somethin'. Okay. Lean on 'em. I'm awake. Yeah? Hey. What's all that about? Did Miss Woods mean what she said? Well, she strikes me as the kind of person that does. I mean... Are you really gonna lose your job? Oh. Well, I certainly hope not. Dad, why don't you give it up? It's not your business. Sayeth Carmel. Why can't you just be a minister and a daddy? Oh, honey, that's... That's what I'm trying to be. Help! Oh, help, somebody! Call the fire department! Help! Carmel, call the fire department! Are you all right? Yes! Call the fire department! Hank, come here! Help me with the fire hose! Turn it on! Hey, you, would you help here a minute? The rest of you, get back! I had no idea... They'd do this. I'm sorry, Anne. It would help if you'd say something. Anything. I, uh... I was so wrong. So wrong. Mike, um... I... Wanna fight them with you. Rookie? Rookie, what's happening? Lost him, Home Plate. Sorry, Mike. Yuck! Whose chili dog is this? I got him, I got him. I'm right behind him. Good, Phantom Fox. Stay with him, stay with him. You dummy! What do you think you're... Watch out! Phantom Fox, what's going on? I got cut off at the pass. Get closer! Watch out for that car! Take your hands off the wheel! There's a lady! Look out! Look what you did! I'm trying to stay with him, Home Plate, but he's really moving! Be careful, June Bride. Be careful. Are you all right, June Bride? Yes, but I don't know what Howard's gonna say about his car. We're turning on klump street, and I'm on his tail. Good going, Rookie. Hang in there. Yahoo! Not this time. Where could he have gone to? I don't know, but I'm having trouble with my radio again. I'm coming in. When we don't pay the winners off on time, they get nervous. They think something's wrong. Business falls off. We don't want that. They got stakeouts on every road. I lose one, I look back, there's another one comin'. They ain't as easy to shake as they used to be. A bunch of church ladies? I'm not gonna let a preacher... And some ding-a-ling dames ruin our business. They get too close to this place, hit 'em. Yes, sir. Every time the collector has shaken us, it's been in here. Then the bank must be in there. Probably, but it's still a very big area. It sure is. Well, he just plain outdrives us. Not necessarily. I don't know what he fuels that crate with. Now, he's obviously got something bigger than a stock engine under there. You can say that again. That's right. "Dear Reverend Hill, the general council... Has voted not to rebuild North Avenue. North Avenue has served its purpose and will be dissolved." Well... Dissolved. Well, we'll appeal that. I'll-I'll call the Presbytery myself. "Further, it is the intention of the general council... To declare the pulpit of North Avenue vacant. Dr. Rheems and Reverend Wainwright will be joining me... For the disposition of the real estate. Sincerely yours, Victor A. Fulton, Presbytery executive." Oh, Mike, I'm so sorry. What exactly does that mean, "declare the pulpit vacant"? It means he's fired. It means I've-I've... Cost you your church. ♪ ♪ We certainly have lovely weather for you folks. Unfortunately, we're not here to enjoy the weather. Has Dr. Fulton arrived? Oh, yes. He's with Reverend Hill right now. There's certainly a lot of static on your radio. Yeah. Oh! Mike? Mike, answer! Answer! Glen Park Church is over five miles from here, and... What's that beeping noise? Oh... oh, that's a radio I use for emergencies. And, you know, transportation will be a real problem for some of our older members. Hadn't you better answer that? I-I... oh, sure. Reverend Hill speaking. Mike, hi. I think I found the missing link. I'm tailing a camper south on Airport. Uh, could we discuss this at a more propitious time? I'm in conference just now. No, this won't wait! I'm positive this is the collection van disguised as a camper, because the motor is giving over the same static over the radio. - Can't you hear it? - That's hardly conclusive. I recognize the driver. It's the same guy. Aren't you supposed to be picking up some people? Oh. Uh, yeah, they're here. Mike, look, uh, if it's old sourpuss Fulton that you're worried about, well, he wouldn't know a good minister... If god put his arm around him and said, "that's my boy." Know what I mean? This is it. Please send us some help. Excuse me, Dr. Fulton, but this is really important. Okay, Rookie. I'll send the Shortcakes over and get Jane. And then I'll call Cleo, and I'll send you all the help I can get, all right? Good luck, and keep me posted. Yippee! Carmel, Dean, do you have any idea where Mrs. Simms is? - There's a pet show at the park. - Find her and tell her to long-distance Rookie. Okay. And hurry, kids, please. Are you ready now? All right, everybody. Oh, uh, move in just a little bit. Oh, yes, that's beautiful. Now, everybody get around the wedding cake. I want one of the wedding cake. Move in, move in. Oh, everything all right, dear? ♪ ♪ Oh, hello there. Who are you? Friends of the bride. Nice to meet you. Right. Oh, no, no, no. Wait a minute. You can't. This is a... This is a respectable wedding. Uh, no gypsies here. Sorry, Howard, I gotta run. I'll call ya. What? Jane? Excuse me. Jane? Jane, look. I don't know what you've been up to lately... And I don't want to, but you're not running out on me now. Then pile in and fasten your safety belt. I'm driving. Okay. Well, that figures. Howard, what about the rice? I haven't the vaguest idea what's happening, Miss Woods, but I wouldn't miss it for the world. Oh, good. Well, uh, watch out for police. Okay. Reverend, check for smokies in plain brown wrappers. - What? - I'm KAHX-1235, the Ecumenical Enchantress. Well, you've just been drafted. All right, all you good buddies. This channel is 10-33. Keep it clear. There she is! Mrs. Simms! Mrs. Simms! Mrs. Simms! Mrs. Simms! Dad says to long-distance Rookie, and to hurry! This could bust the bank! All right. I'm sorry, children. The pet show will have to wait. I wanna go to the pet show! You mean I washed my turtle for nothing? Get in back here. Oh, no! My snakes fell out! We better pick him up, Mrs. Simms! I'm awfully sorry, folks. Things have gone amuck. No, you're... You're going the wrong way. Uh, this-this way. This way. Aah! What's happening here? Come on, hurry! Now look what you did with all your hurryin'! You got a run in me stockin'! Well, it's the last time you'll have to wear them, I hope. It looks like I slid into second. Oh, will you shut up and get in and drive the car! Get yourself in! Rookie to Home Plate. Suspect heading south, both feet on the floor. - How am I hittin' ya? - That sounds like Dr. Rheems. Dr. Rheems? You got it. What are you doing getting mixed up in a thing like this? I want you and Reverend Wainwright to get out of that car immediately. Sorry, doctor. Don't read you. The Ecumenical Enchantress, 10-8 and on the side. Nobody panic. Oh, there's Bruno. Get him, Danny! Get him, Danny! Bruno! Bruno! Bruno! That's a good bowser. Get off my car! Get off of there! Oh, the snake. Did anybody get the snake? He's still at the beer joint, Home Plate, like... Like he has nowhere to go. He could be cooling the work. Hang back, Rookie. Let us know when he moves. Okay. Easy. Easy, Mrs. Porter. Thanks, Alfredo. Give me the keys. Where are the keys? Open the door. Easy. All right, Maximilian, inside. Okay, give me the keys. Okay, bye, Pam. See you later. Be careful. Watch your nails. I'll come back for my things later. Heavens! Oh. Watch-watch your back. Easy. Okay. I think we're all set. Everybody's in. Hello. You better pull it over to the curb, lady. This is gonna take a while. Oh, no, no, I'm sorry. I-I can't right now. I'm terribly sorry. I'm awfully busy. You're busy? Pull this car over there! Hang on, children. Hey! Hey! What are you doing? Where are you going? Come back here! I really appreciate this, and-and you two have been just wonderful. But, you know, maybe you should get out while you can. This could get a little rough before it's over. You do what you want, Reverend Wainwright. But personally, I haven't has this much excitement... Since I got snowed in at the elks convention. There he goes! He's making his move, Home Plate! We're on our way. Keep your distance, Rookie. Let us know his area and direction. Lost him, Home Plate. He may have taken Brunswick Road. Try it anyway. Hold it! Hold it! Look! That gate is closing, and there's dust settling on the road over there. I'll bet he drove up to that warehouse. Yahoo! We found it. This has gotta be it, Home Plate. All right, here we go. Everybody gets some money. How did it go? Milk run. Rookie to Home Plate, Rookie to Home Plate. It's an old warehouse on Hudson, just west of Davenport. And old hawkshaw Wainwright here nailed it. Um, we don't see anything right now, but the camper must've gone inside the building. Mike, I'm positive this is their bank. You're in charge. Reverend Hill! Where are you going? Reverend Hill! Jane! Jane! All right, Howard, I'm coming! I'm coming! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Hey, look. Someone's coming out. Rookie to Home Plate. The door's opening, and there's a tall, grey-haired man... Getting in the limousine, and they're leaving. Come on, everybody. Into your cars. Quick! Jane? Oh. Jane? Look, I-I don't want my car mixed up in this. I-I just got it repaired, and it's perfect again. Howard. Howard, this car is now community property, so get in or get out of the way. Yes, mother. Jane! What's that? It's those dames! Back up! Use the other gate! Come on! All right, everybody!

Oh, look! There's Roca! He's getting away in that convertible! Hang on to your socks, Howard. We're going in. Jane, you can't do this. This is my car. Yes I can, Howard. I won't let you do it. Hush, Howard. Oh! Mike, be careful! Get out of the car! Stop the car! Get him, Rev! Get him! Hold it, hold it, hold it, Mr. Roca. Wait just a minute. Give me my briefcase! Oh, I will in a minute. - Mike! - Anne! Hold it, you! If you'd broken all of my nails, I'd really be mad! I need a safety pin. I got mine. One false move and you got a new nose! Keep his hands up there. You have a right to remain silent, sucker! Anne, we hit the jackpot. We've got the names, we've got the numbers, we've got the slips, we got the money. Twelve hundred dollars for the church sinking fund. We did it. We did it. We did it. Oh! It's a miracle. - I know. - This car in unscathed. - Huh? - I am going to give you a nice, warm bath. And then, I'm going to Polish you. It's a thing of beauty, a joy forever. It's gonna stay... Oh, no, no! Don't hit my baby! No! Howard, get out of here! No! Oh, no. And... The arrests have resulted in at least 12 indictments so far. Also... also, I have it on the best authority... That we can expect some new faces down at city hall. Uh, and I... I don't see them among us this morning, but I'd like to take this opportunity... To express our deepest appreciation... To the six ladies that made all this happen. - Seven. - Seven. Well, that's the, um, the good news. The, uh... The bad news... Is that this will be the last service... Held at North Avenue Presbyterian. In the future, Glen Park Church... Will serve this community. Well, I, uh... I'm not gonna ask how or why, because we all know... He works in strange and mysterious ways. But by the grace of god, the general council of the Presbytery... And six ladies, who also work in strange and mysterious ways, North Avenue is going to retain its charter. - Right on! - Yea!
