Donít worry, donít worryÖ Buse will also be here. If Buse is here, then there is no problem. I will trust you with them and disappear for three days. When they have to live togetherÖ Öthey will learn how to solve problems. I doubt if they became worse. If you help them, they wonít become worse. Canít we solve this problem without the help of Kerem? No, we canít bro. Seymen, in case of emergencyÖ you know what to do, donít you? Yes. Come on, now it ís your turn see you three days later honey. See you. The grandfather has gone. The grandfather has gone! I have to tell this to boss immediately.

Öimpression thanks to her agility and diligence, Buse! Buse. -Kerem? -Let the match start! If you are unable to park the car, get out the car and let me park it. Mind your business. If you get out of my way, I will do it. Oh yeah? Thatís fine then. How will I pass? What will you do by passing? My grandfather called me and wanted me to come urgently, so I am here. Did he tell you to come urgently? He told me the same. It is obvious that he wants to reconcile us again. Then I am goingÖ ÖI have a highly important hearing this week. Say hello to my grandfather. Actually I am going, I have a concert as well. You say hello to my grandfather. Take your car a little bit back to allow me to go out. You take first.

I would surprise if you donít obstinate with me! -Surprise me even once Kerem! -Yes sir, what else? What type of siblings are we, huh? There must exactly be a mistake. I think they confused us with other babies in the hospital. -I wish. I wish! -You are saying ìI wishî? I wasted a year of effort because of you. My brother is still saying ìI wishî. If selfishness is worth, you would certainly be on the first rank. Ugh, I have done with this matter. How should I know that you have an exam on the next day. I am kidding. Did you have fun? Does anybody deactivate the alarm just for the sake of kidding? I wasted a year of effort because of you. You are still saying that you are kidding. -Why did you do it Kerem? -Kidding. -Why didnít you do it Kerem? -I forgot. Your life consists of these two words. Have you ever undertaken the responsibility of your any behavior? ÖI really wonder. Appreciate even a thing that I do honey. I will, if you do good, donít worry. Buse you have needled terribly. You battle-axe! I will complain about you to my grandfather! Grandfather! Inform on him immediately. As you always do. - Grandfather! - Grandfather! - Grandfather! - Grandfather! Give it a rest!

Buse and Kerem. What is this? Give it to me. Come on, open it. ìMy dear grandchildren. I called you here. But youÖ Östarted to fight without looking for me, didnít you? I had an urgent work. I trust my dear animals to you in my absence. Kerem, never attempt to leave this job to BuseÖ ÖI want both of you to take responsibility for this, OK? You canÖ Ötolerate each other for 3 days for me, canít you my dear grandchildren?î The power of the grandfather overcome the grandchildren. It results from years of experience of course. They have remained unchanged. Is there anybody closer to you than a sibling? Come here, I'll kiss you. Ugh! Didnít they allow you to sleep, did they Puspus? What is going on boss? What is this expression Sefer? We all wore black boss, so I thought that itís better to haveÖ Öcolors. It is suggested that blue offers positive energy. How did you find me? Am I cute? What if you were cute Sefer? What if you were cute? Lean! Lean! But you said that there had been nobody at home? But there isnít. Really, I saw. The grandfather had gone. Sefer. Come here, come.

And from this side. Look, look, look. You! Stupid! She almost recognized! We have to go boss. Dude can wake up at any moment. Sefer, look, the shovel worked. You started to think. Which shovel? This one that he hit to your head. Did he hit my head with a shovel? Sefer.. thanks to youÖ ÖI will ascend to heaven despite of all my entire misdeed. -Silent! -We have to go. Silent! Silent! Sefer, silent! I will be noisy, donít worry. I will beat you Sefer! I will beat you! There is somebody in the garden! Run! Run! Who is there in the garden! Who is there in the garden! My music. My music. What is happening? Dude, Seymen. Wait for me. Who said roosters couldnít fly? I am so crazy. Buse and Puspus has been here just a moment ago. Who had been here? Hey, hey! Follow this way. Sefer, run Sefer. They are pursuing us. Run, be quick! Quick! Quick! Quick Sefer! Sefer quick Sefer! Close! Close! Come here! Shoo, shoo, shoo dog! Boss help me! Here, here! Boss, boss help me!

They are escaping, come on! No! Puspus! He was Okkes. Okkes! They had come for Puspus. This means thatÖ Seymen! Seymen wait! Seymen! What happened? Why did we come back here? We should tell all these things to Kerem. Buse.. Silence that rooster. Look at his impression! Will he help us? The house collapsed on us. They kidnapped Buse and Puspus. The man is like an elephant despite of all these actions. He couldnít wake up. He should know that Buse was kidnapped. There is no other person to help us. Letís suppose soÖ Öhow will we make ourselves understood? If I get closer to him and crowÖ Öhe delivers corn to me and I can do nothing apart from crowing. I wish we had a potion. There is some under your feed pot. The grandfather left it just in case. Why am I unaware of it? Wow! You see my grandfather! He is a man of surprise. He keeps surprising us every moment. Are you sure Seymen? Let make somebody on the road smell itÖ Öso we can have a higher chance. Smell this, smell. Kerem? Kerem. I think he couldnít hear us. I guess the potion has expired. Does a potion have an expiry date? Is this green pea? Donít say green pea! Donít say it, I start to feel hungry! I suggest to waking him up and Letting him try the potion. No, no, wait bro. Well, I mean you work slowly. I can do it. Bless you. Thank you. It works. Kerem. Somebody kidnapped Buse and Puspus dudeÖ Öit is better for you to wake up. He doesnít get up. It is not my fault. Hey what is happening?! Kerem. Kerem. Who is there? -We are here. -We, we Who is talking? Show up! We are here honey. Look down. We are here, here. Hey? Donít be afraid Kerem. We are friends. I am your buddy. Oh no. Didnít he exaggerate? Kerem, we should talk to you. Booger! Do not approach! Stay away from me! F˝r˝ldak donít do it. He was scared enough. Are you crazy? Why are you talking to me? You are talking to us. Do we call you as crazy? Oh no, this canít be real. ThisÖ canít be real. This canít be real. What about this? I should get out of here soon! We should also get out. Kerem wait! Kerem wait! Kerem wait! We made you smell the potion prepared by your grandfather. Thatís why you can talk to us. All formula is written on your grandfatherís notebook. Read itÖ Öyou can make all animals do what you want thanks to this potion. If only we didnít mention this matter. Buse and Puspus, our siblings are kidnapped by them. SiblingsÖ animals are speaking. I feel dizzy. Making Kerem smell the potion was really a great idea. Oh no, he fainted! If only they kidnapped him. Buse would find Puspus before 2 hours. What will we do? Kerem is going. Run! I told you to make anybody on the road smell the potion. Wait Kerem. Kerem wait, donít go! He left us. No, no. This is a dream. How can animals talk to people? They canít. Also, I donít care. I couldnít look after the animals. . Buse looks after them. Isnít he the guy we saw in the morning? I donít know. Let me check. Ah, yes, that guy. Shall we kick him? It would be fun. Why are you speaking? Do donkeys speak? What about ai? Ai? It is out of fashion. I sometimes say Asi, for example. In fact Nani is an option, too. Nani, nani, nani, nani. Look thatís good. It reminds emergency. ﬁenay! ﬁenay! Open the door! Open! ﬁenay! What is happening?! A very bad thing has happened ﬁenay. What happened? ﬁenay. Ben went mad. It is very good for you to understand it at last. F˝r˝ldak hasnít woken up yet. What if he got harmed? F˝r˝ldak is a strong rooster, donít worry. You said rooster? You mean F˝r˝ldak is a strong person, huh? F˝r˝ldak, you have finally recovered yourself! Ok doggy, keep calm. Leave me alone dude, come on. Good job. We should call the police station now. Police station? But we are animals. What do you mean by saying ìweî? you say ìyouî. I am taking the control in hand. Follow me. Come, pussycat. Did you eat your feed? Come here, I will feed you. By the wayÖ Never wee at home, ok? What happened? -Hey ﬁenay. -Yes? I.... You? can talkÖ Öto animals. I can talk. Are you talking to animals? Yes! Yes! Is this possible, huh? Can a human being talk to animals? I went mad ﬁenay. Take me to a doctor, now! Buse is calling. Have you reconciled with Buse? -Hello? -Kerem. Can you hear me? I am F˝r˝ldak. They are calling! Only the sounds of animals are heard. Put down. Hanged up on me. Call once more. You donít say! Really? How smart cat you are. Ok honey. Go and relax now, come on. Lean back. Donít answer! Donít answer! They are calling! Hello? Buse? No, not BuseÖ ÖI am saying that animals are calling from her phone. Hello? Why are you holding up on me? Isnít it shameful? -We need you. -Come back Kerem! Come back! What is he saying? He is saying that he is F˝r˝ldak, isnít he? Miaov... miaov.. .Bark... bark... ÖI heard such sounds. Can only I understand what they say? I am really going mad! I am going mad ﬁenay! Take me to a doctor. May be Buse is kidding. Buse and kidding. Think once more. Yeah it is nonsense. Kerem come here please. Come here. Sit here for a while, relax. You should have seen ﬁenay. There were donkeys saying Nani. There were boosters saying booger. I donít feel good ﬁenay. I donít feel good. I suggest you to lie and have a rest. We will see a doctor in the morning, ok? Ok, ok. ButÖ donít leave me aloneÖ Östay here until I sleep ﬁenay. ﬁenay stay here. Please ﬁenay. ﬁenay. We are going to a doctor now. Later on, I have lots of works to do... ÖI should soon go to the concert area etc. Ok, ok, I also need to keep up with the rehearsal. Yes. Look at this situation. Let! Let my bag free! -Help! They are stealing my bag! -They are stealing the womanís bag! Let! Let my bag free! You can make all animals do what you want thanks to this potion. Catch this man quickly! He said ìcatchî, run, run! If I get hold of youÖ They stole my bag; I am fine, thank you. But they stole my bag. Here you are. Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot, really. -Thank you. -Get better soon. Thank you. -Did you see? -What? Did you see the action? He brought the bag. Yes, Kerem. It is obvious that it is a trained dog. Seymen was right. Animals are obeying to me. What are you saying again? I am not mad ﬁenay. All of these are because of the potion. What potion?! What potion?! The potion prepared by my grandfather. The underlying reason of my ability to talk to animalsÖ Öis the potion prepared by my grandfather. Just a minute. You are talking to animalsÖ you didnít go mad... -Ö.. thanks to the potion? -Yes. Ok then. I have understood now. Come on, we are going to a doctor now. ﬁenay one minute, ﬁenay. Just a minute, I will prove it. One minute. -Come here. -We are ashamed! Sssshhhh. Cat come here. Hello? Are you calling me? Dear Kerem, come on we are late. I said ìCome hereî. I am here bro, be my guest. Here you are ﬁenay. What do you want our cat to do? Let me thinkÖ ÖIf you say ìDanceî, will it dance? Dance. What about another action? Öultimately I am a rebellious stray catÖ Ödancing is not the way. What happened? It says that dancing is not the way. He asks if he does something else. Ok, tell it to reversely roll over. Roll over reversely now. And roll over normally. Also do a somersault. I donít roll over once more, I feel dizzy. It is enough bro. Respects to her. Kerem thisÖ ÖI mean this is a great thing. Yes this is great! Because I didnít go mad! I didnít do mad! Yes, you didnít go mad! Yuppie! What happened? Oh no. If I didnít go madÖ Then, Buse was really escaped. Yes. Jump. Puspus? What is this place? Buse! Buse! Buse! Buse! Buse! -It has been a long time -Where am I? The important thing is not where you areÖ Öbut with whom you are. -Who are you? -I am ÷kke˛. Your puppy love before you went to Germany. Snotty ÷kke˛? UghÖ ÷kke˛ why did you escape us? I need Puspus to occupy the worldÖ Öand you were the award my queen! You said ìMy queenî? -Will you occupy the world? -Yes. In fact, if you requited my love, I wouldnít mind the world. But when I occupy the worldÖ ÖI naturally occupy you, too. You like the plan? It is really perfect. Well, tell me how you will occupy. Thanks to the potion. Potion? What potion? Ah my miserable, innocent queen. You know nothing. Be patient. When I became the king of the worldÖ Öyou will be my Queen. And perhaps someone might make our movie. Which actress do you prefer? Who will star you, huh? Donít talk nonsense ÷kke˛. Look, unfasten my hands now. Otherwise, it would be a bad end for you. For whom? For you or for me? Kidnapping is a very serious crime. This not a game ÷kke˛. Come on, unfasten my hands. You still didnít understand anything. You still didnít understand anything. Nothing will be as it used to be now. Sefer! Sefer! I am here, boss. Take this damn cat now and trim its fur. It has not dried yet. Did you like my room? Sefer. Ok. HeyÖ heyÖ Set him free? Set Puspus free! Why are you trimming him? Puspus! Come here you sweet kitty. Puspus! ÷kke˛! ÷kke˛! Let me laugh loudly while getting out to leaving a good impression. Telephone. Did she have a boyfriend? She is beautiful, isnít she? Isnít there anybody? Seymen? F˝r˝ldak? Dude? I saw a person at last! An angel. Hi, baby. What is he doing? I think he is giving a rose to you. How skillful he is. You are very kind. If only you knew my other skills. Where are the others? Well, they are atÖ -We are here. -We are here. Kerem, you have come back. I knew that you would come back. Of course. Because I called. Also he has come back impressively. Well, tell me. Who kidnapped Buse and Puspus? ÷kke˛ kidnapped them. ÷kke˛? -÷kke˛? Our snotty ÷kke˛. -The very same. After you got into university and went to GermanyÖ Öthe grandfather started to prepare the potion. ÷kke˛ stole the formula and disappeared. But, he must grasp that the real key word is PuspusÖ Öso he came back. How come? The key word of the potion are the furs of Puspus. The formula is completed thanks to his fursÖ Öand the potion works. Well, what are these? Farm honey. We examined the surrounding area and collected the evidences. Of course thanks to me. Or else what could animals do? They collided with Dude while they were running after youÖ Ösince then, it has believed that it is a human being. Well, letís check this phone. Only one number is recorded here. Letís call it. Damn! Yes, you sweet kitty. It is time to trim your fur! Boss, the cay has escaped. Catch it then. Stupid! Ok, boss. I will catch it now. Come here! My God! Who am I working with?! Kitty. Kitty, come here. My clothes, you stupid! Kitty come here now! Come on! Kitty! I said ìCome here!î Come here! Kitty! Come here! Boss! Boss, is it enough for now? What is that noise? My phone! My phone! -Hello? Hello, help me. -Buse! Kerem. Kerem. Kerem, they kidnapped me. Buse I will rescue you. Tell me where you are. What do you think you are doing?! Buse! Hello? Do you want to ruin everything? What do you think you are doing?! What do you think you are doing?! Set me free! Kerem will rescue me! And he will send you off. You will be imprisoned. Kerem? This is funny. As far as I know, you are the one who helps Kerem all the time. As you are here now he canít do anything. It is funny, isnít it? ÷kke˛, if I get hold of youÖ Friends. We will find them wherever they are. I promise you. We should to go the police station. What will I say to them? My sister was kidnapped... Öand I learnt this from the animals? They of course wonít believe in you if you say the animalsÖ Ötell me instead. As far as I know, you are a rooster, too? I liked this joke. Everybody is saying the same thing. If I were a rooster, everything would be different dear Kerem. Well, if you are not a roosterÖ ÖHow do you talk to Dude and Seymen? Oh no! I am talking to animals! Or elseÖ Öhave I super powers? Oh my God! I am a chosen person. I am a chosen person. I am a chosen person. I am a chosen person. I am a chosen person. Friends! Tidy up. We are going home. I knew. I knew that I was different from everybody. I am a chosen person. Look what happened. I caught you! -Boss, I caught the cat! -Well done, Sefer. Good job! Go and bring the maps to me now. Ok, boss. Little time left ÷kke˛. You almost occupied the world. Everybody will obey you. Yes. Snowdrop root, moonlight powder, hidden lake waterÖ Öfrog hair, lizard claw and Puspus fur. Only one thing is missing now. Do we have a deficit? We donít have any salt honey. Go and buy it from the grocer. Ok, I can deal with it. -Where are you going stupid? -To the grocer. To the grocer? By the way, we owe 20 Liras to the grocer boss. . I lately bought some junk food. Junk food? Junk food?! I am trying to occupy the world hereÖ Öand you bought junk food Sefer? How many times I have to told you that junk food is very unhealthy?! I wanted boss. Ok. Ok, Sefer! I wonít get angry with you! Ok! Come on. Open those maps, we should get on with our business. I feel a heart spasm. Come on! Now. Yes, letís enter into the home. What is that? Donít get me wrong my friend butÖ Öeven I donít sleep in this home. At least you donít do that. We have lots of works to do. I guess this is a business class travel. Kerem. Look at it. I think F˝r˝ldak liked me a lot. Like? I found the love of my life. The sultan of my heart. My dearie. What is it saying? It says that you are the love of its life. Yes, thatís right. Well, what will we do now? I firstly check this phone in a detailed way. I suggest you to give up fighting now my Queen. Look, I cook some food for you. It is too heavy boss. Put it on the ground stupid! It has wheels. No need for it. But I had gone to a cooking course for you at one time. I was even unable to slow down andÖ Öwent to a dance course as well. I event learntÖ Öhow to control an airplane in case I need some time. Good, you improved yourself thanks to me. You must proud of yourself. I would improve myself more but your inventor grandfather didn't allow it. He was jealous of our genius. So, we seized the potion formula of him. Your genius, both of you?! Your genius, boss. My grandfather does not disclose his formula to bad eggs like you. It is obvious that you stole it. -We prepared that formula together! -Together! The potion is my right as much as your grandfather. Thatís it! - Itís time to settle the accounts! -Forward! See you boss. It will not work though. The formula doesnít fill the bill. How will you occupy the world? Thatís it. Offer me such opinions. LookÖ itís very nice that you wonder the matter. But I canít say it to youÖ Öbecause it wouldnít be a surprise any more my Queen. You will see soon. Very soon. Did you find something? There are only the photos of a building. This is Sapphire? Why are they concerned with Sapphire that much? I meanÖ Might it be related with you? Your concert will be held in Sapphire. Wow, so intelligent, my dear. I donít know ﬁenay. I donít know anything. We havenít eaten anything since the morning, we couldnít think healthily. -I will prepare something. -Ok. She is very thoughtful. Wow. She is very skilled. Just the girl we look for. I swear she is an ideal girlfriend. Watch your step! She is mine. Mind your business, come on. If my grandfather were here, we would find them long time ago. He is doing his best. Why did you say so? You are right. I think I gave him a hard time. We are finally alone baby. WellÖ I think I overstepped the mark a little bit. Not important. You are already right in what you were saying. If only I were kidnapped instead of her. We would find you long time ago. Thank you. This does me good. You know whatÖ ÖBuse has always helped me in my life. I was so sure that she will solve any problem. If my grandfather and Buse were here nowÖ Öwe would solve this problem long time ago. I am really a rubbish. You are not. Look at yourself Kerem. You are famous and many people admire you. If you were a loser, could you achieve this? We are sure that you will rescue them in any way. Really? Really. This is a sign. If only there was a clue. I feel that we neglect some points. Notebook. Perhaps, the notebook helps us. Where is my grandfatherís notebook? Notebook, yes. Well done you good boy. Catch it. Hold, hold, hold, hold. Run. Well done. Throw it once more F˝r˝ldak. Once more. Dogs are so booby. Come on boy, bring it to me. Bring. What is going on? What is this noise? What is this mess? You had turned the home into a battle field. I recommend you my friendÖ Önot to keep a dog at home if you have a garden. Or else they ruin the home. What? What happened? Did we solve the problem? Did we find?What was it? Not yet, Seymen. But I think they havenít prepared the potion yet. BecauseÖ Öif they prepared itÖ Öeverything would become a chaos, wouldnít it? So? I mean... there is still something missing I guess. The notebook says thatÖ Öthe mixture should be blended with a dark blue stone. What is that stone? Letís remind once moreÖ Ö for the audiences concerning with precious stonesÖ The ìnight dropîÖ Ömined in Thailand and known as the biggest sapphire of the worldÖ Öwas brought to Sapphire Shopping MallÖ Öin order to be exhibited in Turkey. Moreover, you can also watch the concert of Kerem G¸neyÖ Öin Sapphire Shopping Mall. Of course! Thatís why there were the photos of the building in the phone. Good morning. I brought pies for you. They will steal the sapphire. Hurry up, we are going. Come on, tidy up. We are going to Sapphire. Be quick. Hurry up a little bit. Dear guestsÖ as from 14:00 oíclockÖ Öthe ìnight dropî which is the biggest sapphire of the worldÖ Öwill be opened to visit at the 11th floor. Have a nice shopping experience. Sefer, do you hear me? Sefer? I hear boss. By the way, I cleaned the ground perfectly boss. Forget the ground now, stupid! You will cut the electric when I tell you to do so, ok? -Understood boss. -Good. I feel worse. The view is great. Shall I move to here when I occupy the world? Puspus where are you? Puspus? Puspus donít worry, we will get out of here. Wait a moment. Damn, what happened?? Mr. Kerem? Yes? I am sorry but itís prohibited for pets to enter into the shopping mall. How come? Of course not? Why? I am sorry, rules are rules. . But I canít get on the stage without my pets. He canít. I have also difficulty in leaving my dog at home butÖ ÖI got accustomed to it. We need to find another solution. What? I found. Thatís it. How difficult to occupy the world. I lost three kilos even before starting. Puspus. Puspus. Are you ok? It couldnít be opened. Endure just for a while. I will take you out here. Ruling the animals? Can it be correct? Can he really occupy the world? They wonít be able to do anything. Donít worry Puspus. Thatís it! Thatís it! Little time left to occupy the world. As soon as I get out of here. I will rescue you. Let me find the keys. I found! Not this one. Itís ok. No! ÷kke˛ had set a trap for us! Hey friends, are you ok inside? Slowly F˝r˝ldak, wait. Keep quiet, otherwise we will fall down. This wonít work ﬁenay. We need to do something else. Like what? Friends, I am sorry to do this to you. Keep your balance! This is better. You are there my unique sapphire. I should detune the frequencies of these cameras. Mr. Kerem. How have you been since our last conversation? -I am fine, fine. -I am fine, too. You know what Kerem, I am also interested in music. I canít believe! Fellow bear! Fellow bear! Come here, too. Where are you? Can you play a game with me? You are perfect. Sefer. Sefer. I am inside. Boss, is that bear you? You are the bear, Sefer, you. I am inside, keep it low. Never boss. Donít worry. Nobody has understood that we would steal the sapphire. Donít say sapphire stupid! Cut the electric now! Now!

This heart throb, this enthusiasm, this loveÖ Öcome with me to run on the wilderness. Letís enjoy the wheat. Letís set up a nest and have small eggs baby. I couldnít find. Dude, can you smell him out? Fried potatoesÖ ÖpizzaÖ Öpopcorn. Oh no. There are various smells. I need to find the chief security officer. Come on, follow me. Come on F˝r˝ldak. We are going. I had a very strange dream Seymen. I believed in that I am a human being in my dreamÖ Öand I was about to catch ÷kke˛. There was also ﬁenay. It wasnít a dream, it was real.
