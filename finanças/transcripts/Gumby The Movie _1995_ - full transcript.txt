Red Ship 7 reporting in. No sign of Gumby in this sector. ♪ He can walk into many books ♪ ♪ With his pony pal Pokey too ♪ ♪ If you've got a heart ♪ Then Gumby's a part of you ♪ Nuts. I thought he wanted to land here. Hi, Pokey. Mind if we put up these posters? No. It's announcing our concert tomorrow. I wish Lowbelly would listen to something else occasionally. Pokey, you know where Gumby is? Nope. Pokey, if you find Gumby, remind him of the rehearsal at the barn, will ya? Maybe if I feel like it. Well, that's not like Pokey. Hey, maybe he ate some bad hay or wild oats. I'll find Gumby for myself. Not for them. You did a fine job, son. Clayboys, shmayboys. Who cares, anyhow? Gumby? Are you up there, Gumby? Pokey, when are you going to learn not to stand by this pole? Yeah. Look out, Pokey. Get off the path! I wish Gumby would tell somebody where he goes. Well, Goo, here we go. Gumby? I won't believe it. It can't be true. To believe or not to believe, that is the question. You better start believing it, 'cause I'm uncomfortable. Now everybody pull himself together. I mean apart. Impossible, Goo. Somebody call an ambulance. Hmm, well, now this is the worst case of multiple compound fusion I've ever seen. This has got to be a dream. We need a cross section on the CAT Scan-O-Rama. Hmm. Just as I thought. These dark areas indicate complete fusion to an acute homogenized state. Hmm. Nurse, place these patients immediately in the de-confusion chamber. Um, set for MAG 4, sine wave pulse 16 at 30 DB to start. I'm not used to this new model. One more and we're set to go. Now, let's just see how our patients are doing here. I'm scared! Wait till you see the hospital bill. I still can't believe it. All right, start slowly and use the micro double-sync pulse. Hmm. Oh, good. Good, good, good, it's working, it's working. Oh my, we've split the chromosomes. We've got to reverse it. Patch in the DNA synthesizer component immediately. All right, now. Easy. Phase in the micro-pulse. Open the DC. Well, fellas. How do you feel? I feel like a dinosaur again, but for a while, I was worried. Yes, well, I was, too. Now I don't want you to worry about any hospital bill, either. It's all free. Chalk it up to research. You helped us prove what this machine can do. You are welcome to have lunch before you leave. No, thanks. I'm getting out of this weird place. I'm beginning to feel like a guinea pig. Say, do you guys know where Gumby might go to look for new ideas for his concert? Well, I would look in the book department. You know how he likes books. Yeah, I had no idea what I was until I read a book on dinosaurs. Say, maybe we could find out what you are, Goo. Uh-oh. Prickle, you and Goo look for Gumby in the first two books. I'll search in this one. Ugh, I'm through searching for Gumby in these books. It's dangerous. Oh, I'm sorry, Pokey. I didn't know you were there. We were looking for you, Gumby. All aboard for the farm. Come on, Pokey, get in. We're going to the farm. Did you want to stay here? Well, then, come on. Oh! Are you okay, lady? I guess I'm all right. Did a car hit you? No, I just learned the loan company is taking away our farm. Gosh, it must be awful losing your farm. It just shows you that to borrow money is dangerous. Thank you, young man. Lady, is there anything we can do to help? I'm afraid not. The E-Z Loan company is taking our farms because we can't make our payments. We had so little rain last year, that our crops couldn't grow. Oh, I don't know what we'll do. I just can't tell my children they won't have a home anymore. Thinbuckle and Fatbuckle, come here a minute. Uh-oh. Looks as if Gumby's up to something as usual. You've got good ears, Pokey. Maybe you can overhear what they're saying. I'm not interested. What about farmer's benefit? Fatbuckle, I like the sound of farmer's benefit. Is it settled? We have benefit concerts? I'm all for it. A-one, two, a-three... You know, Goo, I think Pokey is sick. He's still in the backseat of the car. Oh, Pokey's hurt. 'Cause Gumby spends so much time now with the Clayboys. They usually do almost everything together. Yeah, I guess Pokey feels left out. Fellas, I got some new ideas for our concert out of some books. I'll show you what I mean. Play our next piece. Thank you, Fatbuckle. And I picked everything fresh from the garden. Uh, say, where's Pokey? He's usually always hungry. Oh, he's still out in the car. He's feeling bad about something. Golly. I better go see what's the matter. Pokey, what's the matter? Are you sick? Oh, I'm not much good to you anymore, now that you're always playing with the Clayboys. Oh, I didn't realize you felt left out. I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner. You are going to be with me in the new dance act. You'll be out in the front of the band with me. Sounds like fun. I'm suddenly real hungry. Goo fixed you a carrot cucumber tomato sandwich. - Here, Lowbelly. - Here's your lunch. Oh, what a pretty marble. Gumby, look at this strange marble I found in the hay. Isn't it beautiful? It's a beauty, all right. But I don't think it's a marble. It looks like a pearl. Here, Thinbuckle. What does it look like to you? It sure looks like a pearl my dad bought for my mother. And it cost a lot of money, man. I'll bet it's a real pearl. I'd say it's worth at least $1,000. Well, I'm going to show it to Professor Kapp. He'll tell us if it's real for sire. Oh, I'm awfully sorry, Professor! I shouldn't pop in on you so fast like that. Oh, don't worry, son. This was just one of my many unsuccessful experiments. No harm done, really. Oh my. Now then, what can I do for you, Gumby? Goo found this in our barn. We thought that you could tell is if it's a real pearl or not. Now... Now, um, let me have a good look at this with my crystal laser analyzer. Oh, and on this screen over here, we'll soon get the answer. Calcium carbonate. Pearl. - Wow! - Thank you, Professor. This will be a good start on our farmer's benefit find. We are having a benefit concert in the park tomorrow. And you are invited. Oh, thank you, Gumby. I wouldn't miss it for anything! Oh, my. This music does things to my brain. It does things to my spine. It makes me feel funny all over. This is going to rock the scientific world. Sorry, Lowbelly. They don't allow dogs here. We won't stay long. You can play the radio. This is KDOG on your radio dial. Brought to you by... This is their car. That's their mascot, Lowbelly. He's cute. As we return to the story, we find Penny in her kitchen talking to her neighbor, Maisy. But Maisy, I also heard that ChiChi spilled the kibble... Oh, no! That was gonna be the highlight of the workweek. What should we do? Duplication phase on the electronic robot complete. All circuits in place. Here, waiter, take this back. And bring me another thick shake. And get your circuits fixed before you make another mess. I'll be right back, fellas. What's the matter, Lowbelly? You always like cookies. I'll leave them here for ya, in case you get hungry. We won't be much longer. We loved your concert, Gumby. May we have your autograph? Sure! That robot really has his wires crossed. Uh, golly, I'm sorry. It's okay, sonny. Yeah, yeah, it's my fault, really. You see, I told that robot I wanted to meet you, not eat you. My name's Lucky Claybert. I was at your concert today. I liked it very much. I'm a talent agent and I'd like to help you make it big in show business and TV. Come see me at our studio, Mr. Claybert. And we'll talk. Hey, you may call me Lucky. Young man, you're going to make television history. As long as we can help the small farmers. Farmers? Hey, Prickle, They brought you a new shake. It's about time. I thought this piece of junk would never come back. I've got to get back to my lab right now. Oh, yes. Oh, we've got to go, too. We have a lot of rehearsing to do. We'll drop you off at your lab. Hey, I haven't had my strawberry shake yet. This is great, Tara. We can hear them rehearse. And when they leave for a concert, we can follow them. Oh, look, Ginger. Someone important is coming up the road. Hello, Mr. Claybert. We've been expecting you. Just follow me. Yes, this boggles my brain. Fantastic! Hi, Mr. Claybert. Come to my office. Young man, you have a unique talent. And a perfect medium for that talent is video music television. You and the Clayboys are unknown. You don't even have a record out. But you do your thing on videotape and disc, and everybody will know you overnight. Just sign this contract and I'll arrange for camera crews to come right over and begin taping as soon as possible. Well, before I sign, I must have the okay from all my colleagues. What do you say, fellas? Sign! Sign! Well, Mr. Claybert. Yes, yes, yes. Just-just call me Lucky. Well, Lucky. You've got a deal! Hooray! Look, a television van. Ah. I never saw Lowbelly do that so fast before. Hey, fellas, what do you know! Our first break on TV. Lucky sure works fast. Man, our first TV appearance. Wow! Think I should get a haircut? Look, Ginger, a television appearance. We'll follow them to the station. Let's get in my car now. I'm sure glad they turned on the air conditioner. If they'd only turn a light on now. Boy, the driver must think he's going to a fire. I wish we were going to a fire. This air conditioning is freezing. I'm so cold and stiff I can't move! This is where they turned off the road. But there's no road there, Tara. They escaped this book. Well, so can we. Ah, I see their tire tracks where they turned here. That's no TV station. And what's wrong with the Clayboys? Yeah, this is weird. We better investigate. I don't see any television cameras. And you won't, either. Look, Tara. What are they doing to Thinbuckle? I mean, the robot? You are to capture Gumby and bring him here. They're programming the robot to do something. I can't see or hear what it is. That crazy dog. Look out, Prickle. Oh, my. Poor Lowbelly is all covered with manure. What's a matter with that dumb dog? He's never chased after Tilly before. Lowbelly, you know better than to chase Tilly. Now we're gonna have to give you a bath. We're ready, Gumby. Bring your instruments. What's the water for, Goo? We're gonna give Lowbelly a bath. He's all covered with manure. Hah hah! What next? Put the instruments far back in the van, Gumby. Hey, Thinbuckle? I want to ride in the cab. One stinking dog, coming up. Holy Toledo! What happened? I think something awful has happened to Lowbelly. Hey, this wasn't Lowbelly. This was a robot. I thought he was acting strange ever since we left the cafe. Oh, then where is Lowbelly? Somebody kidnapped him, that's for sire. They made a robot copy of him. We got to catch up with Gumby and tell him. Come on! Goo, while I try to fix the motor, you better look up the number of that TV station, KBLK, and try to phone Gumby. Tara, I can't believe this. They've got Gumby! Gumby form duplication is complete. Gumby robot is ready for a music performance. Looks like Gumby needs help, Tara. Ginger, don't worry. Gumby can take care of himself. Just wait and see. Tara, this looks real bad to me. Now Gumby and the Clayboys are all locked up in cold rooms. We ought to do something. Wait, I want to see what these Blockheads are trying to do. Robot ready to activate. Oh, this is terrible. I can't stand it anymore! Gumby needs help. Follow me, Ginger. Emergency. Spy has escaped. Emergency. What the Gumby robot sees will be displayed on this screen. Use noise clips to control action. Don't you remember the title of the book, Tara? I'll know it when I see it. Ah, there it is. ♪ Here a quack, there a quack ♪ ♪ Everywhere a quack quack ♪ ♪ Old MacDonald had a farm ♪ ♪ Ee-eye ee-eye oh ♪ - Whoops. - The wrong book. Sorry, Ginger. ♪ Hee-haw here ♪ Hee-haw there ♪ ♪ Here a hee, there a haw ♪ ♪ Everywhere a hee-haw ♪ Well, Ginger, I guess I'm lost. I don't know which way to go. Tara, there's the TV trick. Looks like Gumby driving. It's not Gumby. That's the robot, which means more trouble. I'm going to follow it. There's the book I was looking for. And... The robot's going to Gumby's studio. Ginger, we have to warn Gumby's pals. Hang on. It's Gumby! - Hi, pals. - What's up? Terrible news, Gumby. And I couldn't find the phone number for the TV station to tell you. Your car is a real clinker. It won't start. No, the bad news is that Lowbelly's been kidnapped. Whoever did it made a robot copy of him to fool us. Oh, well I think I know where to find Lowbelly. Come on. Get in the van and we'll go find him. Hop in, everybody. Can't I ride with you in the cab? Don't get in the truck! That's not Gumby! It's a robot! It'll lock you in there the way Gumby was kidnapped! Run! That's not Gumby for sure. Time to head for the hills. I have an idea how to fix this robot. Gumby robot's radio transmission has been interrupted. Until difficulty is corrected, select defensive program class A, Evasive. Hooray! Good shooting, Goo. Somebody's coming up the driveway. Hi, kids, uh... What's this TV truck doing here? Oh, Mr. Claybert, it's not a TV trick. Gumby and the Clayboys were kidnapped in it. Yeah, we don't know where they are. We know where they are. Well, there's no time to lose. I've scheduled TV camera and sound crews to be here in two hours. So hop in, everybody. Hop in. I'm sorry, bit I can't remember the title of the book where Gumby is. We remember what's in the book. What's in the book? There's computers galore. And they make robots. - Good. - That narrows it down. Let's all spread out and each look for titles that say "computer" or "robot." Hey, come here, everybody. I think I found the book. This is it! Follow me. Hey, wait a minute. This could be dangerous. Let's call the police. Oh, no time for that, Prickle. Just stick together and we'll be okay. Shh! Now be very quiet as we enter. I'll check first to see what's happening. Still experiencing interference with video transmission from Gumby robot. The Blockheads are distracted now. Well done, Pokey and Goo! Now to find Gumby and his band. Ah, yes, that must be the room. Now hurry. Oh, no, the door is locked. I saw the Blockhead use a key card here. I'll get it from one of them. Video now restored. Gumby robot now ready to continue mission to capture. Reactivate controls. - Ah-hah. - Here's the key. Ah, I tell you... It's cold in here. Colder than a witch's heart. Must be a light switch here some place. Prickle, turn up that thermostat. And, Goo, will you find a cup of hot soup, please? This'll heat up the party. I found a robot that made soup. Reactivate controls. Reactivate controls. Hi, Lucky! Hey, where am I? You're in a science lab, sonny. Hey, what happened to Fatbuckle, Thinbuckle, and Nobuckle? Oh, yes, they're okay. They'll wake up in a few minutes. No problem. Whatever happened? And who's playing the music so badly? You won't believe it. Come take a look. They're all robots, Gumby. Boy, they sound awful! Temporary deactivation of Clayboy robots is complete. The purpose of this program is to obtain pearls from the subject, Lowbelly. When the Clayboy band plays live music, the subject will produce tears that become pearls. But our music isn't sad. Gumby, we better go to your studio now. The camera and sound crews will be there shortly. Prickle, will you see if the Clayboys are awake? Roger, Gumby. Leaping Tyrannosaurus, it's hot in here! Gumby, come look! We've got problems. I'll call Professor Kapp. He'll know what to do. Eh, Professor? Oh, uh, yes... Three meltdowns? Normally, it's serious, but I have a new invention that will handle the problem, so don't worry. Bring them over right away. Now, Gumby, will you and Mr. Claybert please move those sound emitters... Uh, speakers... to you, Gumby? So they are directly over the subject. Now that's fine, gentlemen, fine. Now we'll give her a try. Oops! Oh! I blew a fuse. The system has never handled three subjects at once before. Oh, no. Goo, will you check in the van for any missing instruments or amps? Hey! Goo! Oh, Goo! Oh, leaping Tyrannosaurus! Operator. Gumby, will you answer that while I start the system up again? Hello? This is Professor Kapp's laboratory. - Gumby? - Prickle? Yeah, Goo has been kidnapped by the robot that looks like you. It just drove away with Goo locked in the van. Prickle, have Pokey go to my father and take along the Groobee and meet me at "All About Robots" pronto. And I'll meet them there. Oh, Gumby, do you know how much the camera and sound crews charge an hour? I can't help it, Lucky! They'll just have to wait. Goo is in serious trouble. Hooray! It's working again. And you fellas stand by and watch over there. How do you feel, fellas? I feel great! Goo is in serious trouble, and I have to go help her. Good luck. So long. I'll see you at the barn. Tara, will you pull over at that cassette ahead? You can hide the car in the next row until I come out. Well, what can I do for thee, sonny? Um, I need a suit of armor and a good sword. Well, armor I got, but last week, some barons started a war and the local knights cleaned me out of swords and I'm back-ordered for several days. Fit me out in a suit of armor, then. I'll find a sword somewhere. Now come to think of it, the best sword in the kingdom is still available. I'll take it! It's out in the courtyard stuck in a rock. It belongs to the first swordsman who can pull it out. But first, I'll fit you out with a good suit of armor. You're an odd shape, bit that should do it. Sir, which way to the courtyard? Go left up the street, through the last archway. Uh, thank you. Maureen, come and look. There's a strange-looking knight to try to pill the sword out. That knight would do well in a carnival. Uh, Sir Lancelot. The lad needs a sword. Uh, hold on, Sir Galahad. This man is resourceful. Look! Sir Galahad, I think you are right. The lad does need a sword. Hey, green one up there. Here, catch this. Thanks, sir knight. Sir Galahad, the green lad didn't need a sword. He needed wings. I heard that remark, sir. You see, I've just begun to fight. Holy monastery! The lad's a magician! Of course, sir. Oh, Tara! I'm sure glad to see you. Tara, I've got to find a way to beat that robot so I can go back and rescue Goo. Pull over in front of that cassette. Tara, drive around behind and wait for me there. Hmm. Electric sparks shorting out... of course! Why didn't I think of that before? Uh-oh. Oh, no! Analysis and loading of the Gumby swordplay data is now complete. Programming a robot counter-action in process. Programming now complete. Press R for attack mode. Mission accomplished. Robot ready to return to home base for repairs. Wow! Hurry, Tara, let's go! Okay, guys, which one of you is the real Gumby? We all are. The robot is still behind us! Tara, follow that engine. That's my dad! Pokey, are you sure Gumby told you to meet him here? I don't see any smoke or fire. That's what Prickle told me. Hi, Dad. Hi, son. Where's the fire? No fire, Dad. There's a dangerous robot after is. It looks just like me, and the only way to stop it is get it wet and short out its electrical circuits. But why would a robot be after you, Gumby? I'll explain later, Dad. It's going to be here any minute now. Would you back the engine over there out of sight? And I'll be standing in front of the robot book. When the robot attacks me, fire the monitor straight bore at it and soak it. If you say so, son. Robot now locked on target. Contact in ten seconds. Nine seconds. Eight seconds. Seven seconds. Now, Dad! Circuitry malfunction. Robot repair mode suggested. Holy Toledo! Clayboy robots are now programmed for pursuit. Uh-oh, Gumby. Look, more robots. Holy Toledo! Emergency. Intruders have been detected. Press command key to apprehend. Go get 'em, Groobee! Situation impossible. Press escape key to abandon this operation. Nice work, Groobee. Now let's find Goo. Oh, no! Pokey, where's the whistle that stops the Groobee? Oh, nuts. I left it on the seat of the fire truck. Gumby, how's Goo doing? I think she's warming up okay. Oh, what happened? You were kidnapped and we rescued you. And we're on our way back to the studio. Dad! We are late for our taping session. In that case, son, we'll pretend we're on our way to a fire. Oh, dear. If Gumby doesn't show up soon, I'll be ruined. All the sound and video equipment and the crews are costing me a fortune! Oh, what a bummer. Hi, Lowbelly. Sure good to see you, Lowbelly. Gumby, we are all ready and waiting. Be right with you, Lucky. Here's the cookies for your picnic, son. Here, Goo. I'll start getting things ready for the picnic. Hi, Professor. - Oh, my. - Am I late, Gumby? No. Just go into the barn and find a seat, Professor. Wonderful, wonderful! I've been looking forward to this. Hey, Gumby. How much longer do I have to stay up here and guard these characters? You did a good job, Pokey. You can go inside now. I want to have a talk with the Blockheads alone. Gumby, one member of your band is missing. Fellas, where is Nobuckle? Where else? Just look for the Zs. You know what to do, fellas. Ready. Do it! I'm coming, I'm coming! Sorry, fellas. All right, we've all had our fun. Now take your places. Lights. Okay, Lucky. We're ready! Quiet on the set! Roll the cameras. Action! Title "Gumbymania" in production, take one. Holy Toledo! Shush. That's your cue, Pokey, go ahead.

Well, I'd never leave you, Lowbelly. I'm hungry. When is this picnic, anyway? Pretty soon, Pokey. Would you go and invite our farmer neighbors? It'll be under the old oak tree. Right. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to introduce someone who has a special announcement for all farmers. Gumby! First, I want to thank the person who made possible our new farm loan company. Lucky Claybert! With the money from the videotapes, and from these pearls, we can make loans to help save a lot of farms and send the kids to college. Gumby, look at the sign! Uh-oh. Nobuckle! Yeah? You forgot the decimal point. I don't want to see a single weed in that garden. Well, mission accomplished, Pokey. Yeah. Things are looking up around here now. Liftoff. Liftoff...
