Good throw! Oh, there you go, woo! Ah! You're too fast. Which way are you gonna go? Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha! Here I come! I got it, you can't get it, you can't get it! You can't get it, okay, okay, okay. Now I'm gonna get you, now I'm gonna get you! Comin' to getcha! Gotcha, I gotcha! I gotcha. I'll always play with you. Thanks. Okay, be good for Siti. I love you. Uh-uh, Sunday, uh-huh. Ma'am? Ma'am? Ma'am? Are you okay? I call sir now! I'm really sorry. We did everything we could. Will she ever be able to conceive again? That's unlikely to happen. I just, I don't understand. Hey. Everything's fine. What happened to the baby? We'll talk about that later, okay? No, Bill please, don't do this. We suspect the fetus had already self-aborted in the first trimester. It somehow went undetected. You're lying. I don't believe you. I just want my baby. Mrs. DiAngelo, I understand how hard this must be for you. No. You don't understand. Hey, Ash... You will never understand. Hey, come on, come on. It's all right, come on, it's gonna be okay. Just get away from me. Ma'am, I clean for you. It's okay, Siti. I got it. I just must be tired. Yes, ma'am. Ma'am? Good morning, beautiful. You came to bed late. I'm running late. It's gonna be a late night, so don't wake up, okay? Love you. Siti! Hm? There's dirt by the front door again. Can you make sure it gets cleaned up? It's gonna ruin the floors. Yes, sir. - Oh-oh-oh... - Oh! Sorry, Naomi. Someone's in a hurry this morning. I didn't see you there. Yeah, obviously not. Nice tie, matches your eyes. Uh-huh. I'm sure my boss would appreciate me matching my tie to my eyes as well. I'm yankin' your chain. Ashley's inside, I'm sure she'll be glad to see you. Okay. Try to stay outta trouble! Yeah, why don't you come back here and see how much trouble I can be. Good morning! Ash? Siti? - Good morning, ma'am. - Jesus! You scared the crap outta me. Sorry, ma'am. You shouldn't do that. I don't know what you people do back home, but here, it's impolite to sneak up on people. Yes, ma'am. Ma'am, Ashley in the room. Great. Good morning, Naomi. You know Ash, I'm telling you, there's something not quite right about that Siti of yours. Coffee? Yeah. I just, I don't even know why you guys brought her back with you. She's fine. Her English isn't great, but she's good at her job, and besides... Oh god, I know, I know. She's been with you and Bill for forever, and she doesn't have any family, and her husband passed away, I know, blah, blah, blah. I'm just saying that not everyone is as understanding as I am, and they're gonna think she's a little weird. Stop already. Anyways, what are you doing up so early? It's not even noon. Well, I was thinking that since you've been back you hardly ever go out. It's not good for you to always be cooped up in this old house. I have a lot of stuff I need to get done around here. I've got more stuff due to arrive from Singapore next week that I have to make room for, and it's not gonna get put away on its own. Okay, you're right, but you have superwoman Siti here, so? What do you say we have girls day at the spa and you just leave the rest of this for her to take care of? Come on. After all, she's really good at her job. You're impossible. I know, and that's why I'm still your friend. So let's go, come on, we're going. Come on, let's go. Come on, get your shoes on. Bye. - Did you? - What? Oh nothing, I don't know, nevermind. Come on, coming. Whoa, you should really get superwoman to clean these floors, they're gonna get ruined. Yes ma'am. God, Siti, you're gonna give me a heart attack. Sorry, ma'am. Come on, before I change my mind. I'm coming. PS, why do you have an umbrella, are you a vampire or something? I'll be home for dinner. Not if I can help it. Get in. Oh my god. So, how was adjusting to buying a house in suburbia, buddy? It's good. Really good. Well I heard life was pretty sweet for you guys in Singapore. Yeah, it was great. But you know, I think it as just time for us to come home. You're kidding, right? First of all, you were paid to be there, secondly, you were living in party central, and the best part is, you were among smokin' hot women who would do anything to get with foreign guys, and you gave that all up to come back here because? You're so full of shit, Tom. Okay, well, am I right? Or am I right, hm? Hey, don't chicks do anything for foreign guys? I don't know, man. Are you trying to tell me that after spending five years there, not one woman threw themselves at you? - What? - Ah, see! I knew it, huh? They did, didn't they, huh? For god's sake, come on, give this guy a break. Well shit. That's it. We're so done with this conversation. So, how is Ash doing, anyway? She's okay. You know, she has her good days and she has her days where she doesn't wanna get out of bed. Hey, she's a strong girl, and she'll get through it. I know. And before you know it, you're gonna hear the sound of little pit-a-pattering feet through that house. Dork. Yeah, I suppose you're right. Do you wanna know the crazy part, though? Sometimes I think I can hear those little feet running through the house now. Yeah. I think somebody needs to get laid. I think, I think that's it. - You guys. - Do you think so? Looks like there's gonna be a hell of a storm tonight. Yes, ma'am. Put her under the porch before you go to bed. Uh, ma'am. Inchik say no good to move her. Yeah, well Inchik would be singing a different tune if he ever spent the night in a storm. We'll put her back in the morning. But ma'am. And can you set this out only after sir gets home? Yes ma'am. And make sure that there's no more dirt in the house in the morning. Yes ma'am. Good night, Siti. Good night, ma'am. Ma'am! Ma'am. Ma'am, must eat. No good eat no food. You know what it feels like when your world suddenly goes dark? And all your hopes suddenly taken away from you? Yes ma'am. Of course you do. What on earth does a woman from some remote village in Indonesia know about a world going dark? You barely understand me when I ask you to go boil some water. Fuck. My husband die in accident, ma'am. He is on motorcycle, and bus hit him. I'm so sorry, Siti. I didn't know. It's okay, ma'am. Slowly, you be okay, too. I don't wanna be okay. I just want her back. I've heard stories, you know? They say she can be kept. Bad magic, ma'am, no good. So it's true, then, it can be done? I don't know, ma'am. Then bring me to someone who does. God damn thing doing here? Siti? Ash? - Sir. - Ah! For god's sake, Siti, you nearly gave me a heart attack. Sorry, sir. What the hell are you doing up at this hour? Ma'am asked me wait for you for dinner. It's okay, I already ate. You should get to bed, it's really late. What? Nothing, sir. Must lock door. Good night, Siti. - Naomi. - Hey. Oh, uh, you'd think all the bathrooms in my house would work considering what I paid for it. What are you doing here at this hour? All the plumbers are over to fix a water main leak, yay. Oh, good morning, handsome. Naomi, wow. Nice to see you makin' yourself at home. Oh well, you know what they say, - Uh, shouldn't that be... - Go. By the way, you guys, you should probably get your downstairs checked. There's like some funky smell coming from your den. Oh well, maybe it's just your... Hey, I said go now. And you, downstairs. Okay. We're gonna find out about this funky smell you're talking about. You know what you need in here? You need some light, and you need some fresh air. I don't notice any smell in here. Trust me, there's a smell. You gotta let that go. I have. You can bullshit everyone else, Ashley DiAngelo, but you can't bullshit me. Do you think I have what it takes to be a good mother? Think? Ash, I know. I know that you'd be a great mother. She would've been six months old today. Yeah. Like you really can't smell that? Maybe it's just musty in here. It happens with old houses. No, it smells like rotting meat. Hey, do you have a flashlight? Uh yeah, I think so. I'll go take a look. I'm gonna find you. Ash, is that you? Do you have the flashlight? Ash. Siti, god! Sorry ma'am. Torchlight. How many times do I have to tell you? It's rude to sneak up on people. Okay, we do not do that here. We make our presence known to others. Do you even understand me? What happened? - Are you okay? - You have to, you have to tell her to stop creeping up on people. I'll take care of this, Siti. Why don't you go see if breakfast is ready, okay? Yes, ma'am. Sorry ma'am, I didn't do on purpose. Are you serious right now? Hey, we're all okay. Why don't you go see if that plumber of yours knows how to use his snake? He's gonna need a real big snake for the job. Call me when you're up, okay? Yeah. And get rid of this hideous statue! Are you laughing at me? Hey, I'm serious. I can't keep cleaning up after you every day. You only at the candy last night. You didn't like the meat? That's the best that I can do right now, okay? I need you to work with me on this. I know, it's the 14th. You must promise me to be good, am I clear? Are you spying on me? Uh. I um, I'm just headed out, so I thought I'd say goodbye. I'm gonna be late, so don't wait up. Well try not to be too late. I've got a surprise for you. A surprise I like surprises. Or maybe I could just call in sick and you could surprise me all day long. Right. Dream on, pal. Sir? Shit, yes? Headphone, sir? Fuck Siti, just leave it there. Hey hey, calm down. It's okay. Thank you, Siti. What's going on? You're all jumpy. The way she does that all the time. Does what? Nevermind. You're always on her side anyway. What's going on with you? I gotta go, I'll see you later. What is your name? Actually, actually, you know what? Ladies, ladies, ladies. This is my friend Bill. - Hey, Bill. - Hi, Bill. - Hey. - Hey. Now Bill has been a very bad boy. Phil has given up the joy of getting his brains fucked every night by smoking hot women for the wonderful world of monogamy in suburbia hell. Aw. Fuck you. See but, as his best friend... Oh really? Yeah, yeah. Oh, okay. As his best friend, I think it's only right that I save him from himself by making sure that his balls get sucked dry tonight. So any volunteers? Bottoms up, pants down. Cheers. I think I can volunteer. - Well there you go. - Wonderful. Ooh. Wait, wait, wait, I got an idea. You do? You're a naughty boy. I am. How naughty are you? Very naughty. Ah! - What, are you okay? - Get away from me. Are you okay? Don't touch me! - What the hell? - Whoa. Hey, are you guys okay? I think your friend here has a slight case of a guilty conscience. Bill? You feelin' all right? Guys, I'm sorry, I just. I think it's just the drinks getting to my head. Buddy, I think it's Ash is getting to your head. Right. Why don't I get you another drink? No, it's fine. It's late. I should be getting home. I promised Ash I'd be home early, so... Why don't I give you a ride? No, it's okay, I. Well, you guys stay, have a good time. I can give you a ride, it's just... No, it's fine. Honestly, I'm good. Hey, next round's on me, everyone. You asleep? I'm sorry about this morning. You've just been a little on edge lately. Is everything okay at work? Mm. It's just. You know, um, I believe you owe me a surprise. Stop that, it's not that kind of surprise. Well I would like it to be that kind of surprise. I bet. It's actually that kind of surprise that led to the surprise I'm about to spring on you. What are you talking about? Is this accurate? Yeah, I tested three times just to make sure. Oh my god, baby. I don't even know what to say. Hey. Wait, do you know if it's a boy or a girl? Because we're gonna have to convert one of the rooms into a nursery. Or maybe we just have a nice neutral Or maybe we could have the baby in here... Okay, let's just slow down a bit. I only just found out. I got a doctor's appointment set for Thursday. Do you wanna come? Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss it for the world. What was that? Eh, it's probably just Siti. I'll go take a look. Bill? I'll be right back. Ah! Fuck! Fuck. Are you okay? What happened to your foot? I stepped on some broken glass in the kitchen. Broken glass, how? I don't know. Doesn't look too bad, I'll get some peroxide. I don't understand why she would just leave it lying there. Who? Siti. She probably just missed a piece, that's all. I'll talk to her in the morning, okay? I'm exhausted, let's go to bed. Yeah. Never makes sense. Broken glass, sounds. I saw something, Ash. In the den. It's probably just Siti. You're always saying she likes to pop out of nowhere anyway. It wasn't Siti. It was something else. - Do you think... - Honey? You've been out drinking with the guys and you've had a long day. Your eyes and your mind are probably just playing tricks on you, that's all. I love you. I love you, too. Remind me to reset the clocks in the morning. I think I must've shorted them out 'cause they've all stopped. Mom! Sweetheart. Mm. I've missed you. Me, too. I don't know why we don't catch up more often. I think we saw more of each other when you lived in Asia. I know, Mom. I'm sorry. You comin' in? Yeah, just had to catch my breath. Well, hello, Siti. Good afternoon, ma'am. How are you adjusting to your new home? Glad to see you're as talkative as ever. Mother, let's not start, shall we? You just got here. This house sure has personality, doesn't it? It's called character, Mom. Mm. You still haven't gotten rid of that god-awful thing? It was a gift, Mom. A gift that should've been re-gifted. Sorry, are you gonna congratulate me, or what? Oh, I was getting to that. Oh. How are you feeling? I'm good. The doctor says that everything's going along just fine, and that I don't have anything to worry about. What was that? I'll go take a look. Stop that. What is that smell? It's an old house smell. I live in an old house too, dear, and I certainly don't have the smell of rotting flesh in my den. Yoo-hoo! I see that mama's here! - Naomi! - Hi! - Hi, honey! - Oh. I see you're still looking as ravishing as always. Well, thank you, I try. God, honestly it's so nice to see you. I've missed you! I've missed you, too. So? Anything new in your life? Well, you know what they say. So many men and thank god I have so much time. Come on guys, I think we need a picture. Wefie time, come on, come on, come on. Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit. Sit, sit. Okay, ready? Smile. The three musketeers. Ah, there he is. The man of the hour. Uh-oh, what did I do? With any luck, what you is gonna make me a happy grandmother. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. What? Seriously? Yeah, I just had to make sure. I can't believe you didn't tell me! You weren't the only one. That's it, I'm telling everyone, sorry. Right, well, you ladies have a good day. I've got back to back meetings today, and the first one starts in 30 minutes, so. Okay, bye. Bye. Okay, now that he's gone, I think we should go baby shopping. No. Great idea! Come on, I know just where we can go to get started. Perfect. Come on, Ash, we'll be waiting for you in the car. That's enough. We're not discussing that now. When's the baby due? December sixth. Winter baby! - Want wine? - Oh, it's gonna be so cute. Why not? So Renee, how do you like the house? Well, I suppose it has its own charm. It's a creepy ass house if you ask me. Not as creepy as the maid. I have a toast to make. I know that it isn't always easy being married to me. You've put up with a lot, including me dragging you around all corners of the world these last few years, but I just wanna say that there isn't a day that goes by that I don't thank God for you. I must have done something right to deserve someone as perfect as you are. I love you, honey. You are going to make an amazing mother. Hear, hear! Hear, hear! I'll toast to that. Hear, hear! Cheers. You two are gonna be the best parents. It's like the luckiest baby, seriously. Yeah, yeah, but can he play soccer with the kids? I don't think so. That's why I have Siti. Having a child, let me tell you what I know. Are you hoping for a girl? So you're not gonna find out till the very end? Yeah, I mean, it's gonna be busy. - It's a lot of work. - You know? It's a lot of work, but... And listen, you're in it for the long haul now, I'm telling you now. Stop, you gotta stop scaring her. No, no, no, just talking. Has anyone seen Naomi? She in toilet, ma'am. We say restroom, Siti. Be nice, Mother. I'm only helping Siti understand the nuances of our language. Nothing the matter with that, is there, Siti? No, ma'am. See, no harm done. I wouldn't worry about Naomi, Renee. She can make herself feel at home, for sure. Hello! Help! Hello, let me out, let me out! Someone help! So have you decided what room you're gonna turn into the nursery? Well, uh, we thought it would be good to keep the baby close for the first bit, so we're gonna have the cot set up with us. No, bad idea. Yeah, I second that. Why? Marriage bed, though. I hear ya, pal. Huh! Babies are sex police. New baby, your new schedule, you have leaky and sore nipples, and your body becomes a fart factory. Next thing you know it, your vagina becomes a Venus fly trap, and you are in a dry spell for 18 years. 18 years, Bill. Sounds about right. - Aw! - Oh, god. Naomi? Oh, let me out! Ma'am, you okay? Get away from me! God, it was you, wasn't it? I know it was you! What is going on here? That fucking bitch locked me in the bathroom! No, no ma'am! Ma'am, Naomi cannot open door, so I help her open. Okay, you're a lying bitch, I know you did it! Hey! You know what, it is late, I think we've all had enough excitement for one night. Yeah, we've got an early start with the kids tomorrow, so we'll see you later. Come on, Naomi, I'll walk you home, all right? Hey. Get some rest, okay? Aw, come here. Listen, it's been a long day. Go get some sleep. Come over for breakfast, I'll make you some of my famous berry maple waffles. - Okay? - Okay, okay. Go. Never a dull moment around here, huh? Night, Mom, I'll see you in the morning. Night, sweetheart. Good night, ma'am. Good night, Siti. Bill, is that you? Ash? You all right? I'm fine. I'm just tired. Okay. Let's get you to bed. What the hell is that? Oh my god. What is she doing? You're messing with the wrong old lady, little girl. Get out. What did he say? Oh, morning, sweetheart. Morning, Mom. I see someone's preparing her specialty. They're just waffles. They're only the best waffles in the world. Where's Bill? Early morning meeting. I don't even know what time he left. That means you slept well. Not too bad. What about you? Like a baby. You're really going to have to take care of yourself this time. I know, Mom. Well at least you're home now, and not in some third world country. It was Singapore, it's hardly a third world country. As a matter of fact, CNN says it's one of the world's greatest cities. Well, I don't care what CNN has to say, any country that touts itself as an English-speaking country and can't even string a proper sentence together can hardly call itself developed. Mother. You're gonna have to do something about that smell in the den. There's no smell, Mom. It's just musty. Honey, I was with your father for 40 years, and trust me when I tell you, I know musty, and that smell in your den is nothing near musty. I wonder where Naomi is. She's always here, even before I'm up. I called her, but she didn't answer. Oh! So, how does it feel to be pregnant? Stressed. Oh, you don't know stress till the baby arrives. What do you know about that? I think it's his two ex wives and his four kids talking. That's the checkbook talking, eh? Hey, did you guys see that weird picture that Naomi posted last night? Mm-hm. Nope. Oh, you got to see this. Look at that. What the hell is that? I don't know, maybe some kind of double exposure or something? What century are you living in? There's no such thing as double exposures on cell phones. Okay, well maybe the maid's hand moved while she was taking the picture. Are there any more of these? That's the thing, this is the only one she posted. Social media queen has hundred of these by the morning. She's been oddly quiet today. Naomi, quiet? You gotta be kidding me. We'd sooner have the world come to an end before that happened. Naomi, you in there? Where the hell is she? Naomi? Oh my god. Naomi? Naomi? You up? Naomi, you up there? Oh. Oh. Oh, sweetheart. What have you done? Ash. Oh sweet Jesus, Mother. Didn't anyone ever tell you not to sneak up on someone like that? I think we have to leave. Naomi is not here. Well, she was. We just need to go now. I need to show you this. We can talk about that when we are out of this house. But... Ash, now! Ash! Ash! Renee? Ash! Bill! Sir, ma'am. Dinner is ready. So. Did you ladies manage to stay outta trouble today? What did you both do? - Groceries. - Shopping. Grocery shopping. Nice. You know, I was thinking, seeing as I'm here, why don't I start to help out around the house a little bit, make myself useful. Mom, there's really no need. I know. But you've had a lot on your plate lately, and I just thought I could help you out with all those boxes from Singapore. Get rid of some of the old stuff, like, well, we could start with that statue out in the back yard. That's a good idea, actually. I hate that statue, anyway. You're gonna be welcoming a new baby soon. You have to get rid of the old energy before you can welcome in the new energy. She's right, you know. I mean, you have so much to do around here, and I've been so busy, I can't help out. And Siti certainly has enough to do around the house as it is. Mom? You all right? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. I think it's time to pack it in. Got a meeting to prep for anyway. Good night, Renee. Good night. I'll help Siti with the dishes, I'll be up in a bit. Sweetheart... Mom, please. We've both been through a lot today. Can we just talk about this some other time? Well, try not to stay up too late. Good night. Good night. What did he say? He say must follow paper. She's yours forever. I understand. Every month, 14th, must feed blood, and no matter what, cannot throw her away. That's ridiculous, I would never throw her away. What did he say? Uh. He, he wish you good luck, ma'am. Thank you. Hi, Raphael, it's Renee. Listen, given that you're the expert on Southeast Asian mysticism, I have a couple of questions I wanna pass by you. I've been having visions, a little girl in a red dress. But you know, there are other things, like noises in the house, some smells. Any idea what it could be? I've gotta go, I'll call you back. Hush. Is everything okay in here? I was just about to ask you the same thing. I just went to get some water, and I thought I heard talking in here. We need to talk. About what? There's something unholy in this house. It's not happy, and it wants you to know it. Don't be ridiculous, Mom. Listen, honey. I've seen plenty of things in my life. And what you have here is a very deep, dark evil at work. What did you do? If you don't tell me everything, I can't help you. I don't need your help. If you wanna keep this baby, you do. You need to tell me everything, everything. I'll take care of it. Ash. Here. Looks like you could use that. Thanks. What? Nothing. By the way, have you heard from Naomi? No. You came to bed late last night. Yeah. Just tryin' to catch up on some work. I have this new account, and we're shorthanded, so. It's gonna be another late one for me at the office, so. Don't wait up. I'll leave your dinner in the microwave. I love you. Siti! Yes, sir. What the hell is that thing doing here? Uh. Uh. Why is there all this dirt on the floor? Sorry, sir. I've told you a million times that the dirt ruins the floors. What the hell is wrong with you? Sorry, sir. I clean now. Yeah. I want that damn thing out of here today! Ashley? - No, Mom! - Oh! - No, Mom, no, no. - It's okay. Siti! Yes, ma'am. Siti, call the doctor now! Yes ma'am. It's okay. It's okay. Oh, it's gonna be okay. Everything's fine, there's nothing to worry about. Make sure she gets plenty of rest, lots of fluids. Try not to do any heavy lifting over the next few months and keep your stress level to a minimum, okay? Thank you, doctor. Thanks so much for coming. Call me if anything changes. Thank you, doctor. Siti, can you show the doctor out, please? Yes, ma'am. Looks like we're adrenaline junkies, huh? I'm sorry, honey. It's okay. I wanted to get out of the damn meeting anyway. Why don't you get some rest. So. How are things going for you? Pretty good. I haven't been sleeping very well. Then there's the pregnancy. I need to talk to you about that. - Look, Renee... - Sir, ma'am. Look, Renee, I promise I'll take good care of her. That's not what I mean. She's just been through a lot this last year. And I know she's worried she's going to lose the baby a second time. Haven't you noticed any strange things going on in this house since the pregnancy? The only thing strange in this place is Siti. I'm not talking about Siti. The smell in the den, the sounds in this house. The visions. I don't know what you're talking about. Look, Bill, we can't play around with his. We've got to do something and fast. Siti. The only thing we need to do is to make sure that Ash gets through this pregnancy. If we don't do anything about what's happening here, the pregnancy is going to be the least of your worries. Yes, sir. Can you check on Ash? See if she wants anything to eat. Okay, sir. Look, there's nothing going on here. It's just an old house. It's doing what all old houses do. Oh, Bill. Are you really that stupid or are you just playing dumb? You brought back something with you from Asia that you should never have. Renee, I know you blame me for what happened in Singapore. I'm not talking about that. Bill? Siti? (Ashley breathes heavily. Oh, no! No, no, no! Ah, no! Ma'am, ma'am! Ma'am! What do want, Siti? Sir ask if you want to eat something. I'm not hungry. Okay, ma'am. It's the 14th tonight. I didn't forget, ma'am. Look, we haven't got much time. It's getting stronger by the day, and at some point, Ash is going to lose control. And trust me when I tell you, it's not going to go down without a fight. What the hell are you talking about? Sir, ma'am say she's not hungry. All right, thanks. Whatever you brought back, it wants Ashley all to itself. It sees this new baby as a threat, and it will stop at nothing to destroy it. And that means everyone and anything that gets in its way. The body of Twin Cities resident Naomi Richardson was just discovered by local authorities. Ms. Richardson was found dead by the city police. According to a spokesperson, Ms. Richardson was found dead in the water tower, security have said they first believed it.

No. Now, at the top of the weather, spring hasn't sprung. Oh my god. No, no! Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am. I have problem, ma'am. This can't be happening. We've gotta do something. I cannot, ma'am. Too late. Contract broken. What are you talking about, what contract? What the fuck is going on? Oh my god. He told you something else that night, didn't he? Warning, ma'am. You sad over baby, I did not tell you, ma'am. What did he say? He say, hey say, cannot get pregnant, ma'am. Give that to me. What do you do, ma'am? Undo a mistake. Ma'am, no ma'am! Ma'am! No ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am. Ash! Ah! Hey Bill, it's me, um, just call us back. We heard about Naomi. Why would Naomi kill herself? She wouldn't. What the fuck? Bill. We need to get out of here. We need to get out of here fast. What do you want? Mommy! She's not your mommy! Yes, she is! What the hell was that? Help me, Daddy! Don't listen to it. It's trying to trick you. What? Ashley has been raising a ghost child. That amulet she wears around her neck, it holds the oil from the corpse of a fetus. The statue in the backyard is where it lives and feeds and Siti has been helping to take care of it. You've got to destroy both of these things by midnight tonight. Mommy? Mommy? I love you. You're wrong. Ash would never do something like this. It gets stronger on the 14th of every month. And it's the 14th tonight at midnight. Hurry. Time's running out! I'm not your mommy. I'm so sorry. Please don't leave me, Mommy. I promise I'll be good. No, you are not my child. You never were. Anna DiAngelo, come stay with me. Anna Di Angelo, come stay with me. Anna DiAngleo, come stay with me. Mommy. Mommy. She exhibits signs of paranoia, combined with bouts of severe depression that can last for several weeks. She has moments of psychotic manifestations which include hearing voices, delusions, hallucinations. Something terrible must've happened to her. Her entire family perished in a house fire. She's been here ever since. And the doll? She believes that's her child. She suffered a miscarriage, but not in the fire. We believe that's what triggered her psychotic break. Mommy, don't leave me.
