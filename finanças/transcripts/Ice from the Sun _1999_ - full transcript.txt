Please! Please! No! No! No! No! Steven! Get on your knees and pray to me. You obey. I command. Just as it was before. Now get on your knees. Amen. In Evans City, Pennsylvania. What started as an innocent Saturday afternoon picnic in the woods turned into a nightmare. Six friends went into the woods together. One came out alive. The survivor was Vikki Tonatair, and she has one disturbing story to tell. Two people wearing Halloween masks made me watch some kind of ceremony in some kind of arena or something. A man was being brought body parts and glasses and what looked like blood... Like they were awards for him or something. The people in the masks were clapping. Then the man raised his hands and there was an earthquake. And everything came crashing down all around me. The people in the masks ran off. The man who was on stage came after me. He tried to strangle me with a wire. Medical experts are speculating that Vikki Tonatair and her five friends were attacked, kidnapped, and - with the exception on Vikki - murdered. Vikki's nightmarish memories are being blamed on hallucinogenic drugs she was given by her attackers. Authorities are considering the possibility that this event is an example of cult activity. That's what Buck said. If Troutman owns the other buildings then maybe he'll give us some sort of special treatment, considering he kind of owes us. Hey Aaron. Come on in. Thanks. We're all here because of Buck, our maintenance guy? Yep. What's he got to tell us that's so important? He said something about saving the building and keeping us from all moving out. Hit me with it at about two o'clock this afternoon. Said get everybody in the building together so we can talk about it. Well, we're all here. So where's Buck? Late. Alison. Hear my voice. I... I hear you. Where... where have you taken me? You have brought yourself through this passage. However, it is necessary to interrupt your course. We have a mission for you to undertake. Mission? What... what's going on? Alison. You have given up your earthly existence. You are on your way to the afterlife. There you would pay for your sin and then move on to your next phase. I have been sent to intercept you. Sent? By who? I thought Super Grover kicked some major ass. Oh, I don't even believe you. He had to put a helmet on! Come on! So what? Cookie Monster would dive straight in without a helmet. He would go in, he would just chew Grover to bits. Okay, fine, whatever. I still like Super Grover more. The Cookie Monster, he didn't give a shit about anything. He just sat there and devoured the entire store. Alright? He ate everything in sight. I mean, he's a big, fat, furry lard ass. So are you both picky eaters or is one of you just putting up with the other one? He's the picky eater. It's the black olives and shit, alright? I don't... I don't eat shit that's slimy, okay? I've actually had nightmares about it. He's really weird about that stuff. For example, who in this room wets their toothbrush before they put toothpaste on it to brush their teeth? See, my husband is unbalanced. He puts toothpaste on a dry toothbrush and then brushes his teeth. If it's wet it's fucking gross. Like someone used it before me. You know his mom wanted him to be a doctor? But I don't think surgery would sit well with somebody who gets grossed out by slimy vegetables and wet toothbrushes. I have been sent by all the angels in heaven and by all the devils in Hell. We all need you, Alison. Hidden magic once pulsed within your planet. Royal sorcerers commanded this magic and kept their kings and queens in secure command. These wizards were paid illustriously for their supernatural services. In this age of kingdoms ruled by magic power lived an evil wizard named Ambolin. Ambolin was a failure at his craft, unable to command soil or soul. Consequently, his king and queen fell from power and were killed. There was a young jester named Abraham, who was also employed by the castle. When the king and queen died, Abraham was taken in by the wizard. Abraham soon became Ambolin's apprentice. Ambolin decided to journey to another land, a new world born of sorcery and filled with atrocity. Abraham was passionately devoted to his master and desperately wished to join him on this journey. Ambolin commanded his apprentice to prove his devotion. Abraham was instructed to murder the woman he loved. Abraham obeyed. Ambolin and his appretice celebrated the murder by drinking of the dead girl's blood. The blood of Abraham's lover turned to salt in their throats and dried up their hearts. The wizard and his apprentice escaped this world, leaving behind the stinging memories of failure. But they were not taken by death. They entered another world created by Ambolin. Within this unnatural reality, Ambolin could finally take a ruling position, entertained by the torment of humans. Ambolin's new world was contained in it's own dimension, an abomination of natural time and space. Ambolin reached up to the sun and scraped ice from it's surface. These frozen chunks and slivers melted in Ambolin's grasp. The resulting ocean surrounded Ambolin's dimension. Once in place, the water again froze, creating six walls of ice that contained Ambolin's unnatural reality. Thus began a cycle that would continue to take life after life within the frozen walls. Every few years, six humans would be chosen from the earth and delivered through the ice. These humans would be brought into Ambolin's world and challenged with impossible contests, playing against Ambolin's apprentice. Ambolin would savor each player's torment, eagerly anticipating their eventual death. The apprentice gained more and more assistance with each killing. When a human died, their soul would not leave. It would be trapped by the ice and could then be manipulated by the apprentice. He could reincarnate any soul, dictate the being's actions, and use this being against a human victim. This cycle continued until the apprentice made a detrimental error. He was confronting the sixth human of a recent round, a man named Steven. Steven was to be tricked into believing the apprentice was dead, then enticed with a proposal of commanding Ambolin's world himself. While this deception was planned for Steven, the apprentice unintentionally deceived Ambolin as well. The apprentice found himself trapped in a state of limbo while Ambolin actually granted Steven command of the dimension. The apprentice knew that he had grown powerful enough to destroy Ambolin. But he had never before considered this option, as his devotion to Ambolin remained strong. However, terminating Ambolin's existence was the only way to escape his confines and return to his former status within the game. The apprentice cried out, his voice turning to flames as it reached the ears of Ambolin. The fire entered Ambolin's mind and burned away what was left of his soul. The apprentice was free to resume command. When he took Steven's life, Steven was preparing to kill the sixth victim of his reign. This woman, the only human ever to escape, descended back to earth. With Ambolin destroyed, the apprentice became more powerful than ever, treasuring his status as the single dominating presence in his world. Dana here is afraid of churches. Who wouldn't be? Yeah, well, I have actual reasons to be afraid. Me too. Baptists. No, you don't understand. My father was insane. When I was a little girl, he would drag me to church, telling me the whole way there what a sinner I was. Eventually, Dad was beating the shit out of me, trying to pound some sense into my head. I was always showing bruises and cigarette burns, scrapes and cuts. My father would tell me I had to go into the confessional and confess that I had done all that physical abuse to myself. I actually did it. I lied in my confessions. Now churches just give me the creeps. No one ever found out about it? That it was your dad beating you? They found out when I was still kind of young. I did live with my grandmother for a while. I went through some sort of kiddie therapy but as I got older I learned just to let it go and say "Fuck you, Dad." I submerged myself in my artwork. I got stoned a lot. And now I conciously avoid being anything like my father and I stay away from churches. Strange. What about you, Matt? You got a phobia? Fear of losing your Legos? Fear of misplacing your Klingon dictionary? Fear of making a donation to PBS and hearing your name mispronounced on the air? Fear of losing your autographed photo of Sylvester Stallone? You know it's a forgery- No. Assholes... Suffocation. That's my phobia. I think suffocation or drowning would be like the worst possible way to die. I don't think about dying. Doesn't scare me. Getting maimed, ending up in a wheelchair, getting brain damaged... that's what's fucked. If I can't wipe my own ass, I'd rather be dead. When I lived in my last apartment, the guy in the place below me had a heart attack and died. He lived alone, so no one knew he was dead down there until some of the other residents and I started to smell the guy rotting. He'd been dead two weeks down there before the cops went in to get him. The dead guy had a dog and the cops found the dog standing over the corpse, protecting its owner. They had to get the Humane Society to come and trap the dog because it was growling and snapping at the cops and wouldn't let them near the body. The dog was still loyal, even though his owner hadn't moved for days. Oh, that's such a load of bullshit. Don't romanticize the situation. The dog was protecting it's only supply of food. The mutt obviously hadn't been fed since it's owner died. It had to eat something. They probably found most of the corpse with his hands and face cleaned right to the bones, the dog gulping down that last bit of ear cartilage. That's reality. That's life on planet earth. The apprentice must be terminated. The angels in heaven want to end his reign of evil and eliminate forever his corruption of natural time and space. The devils in Hell also desire his destruction. The devils in Hell also desire his destruction. A single presence dominating an entire dimension has made the devils extremely jealous. A single presence dominating an entire dimension has made the devils extremely jealous. But even with our combined desires to eliminate his presence, none of us, the angels nor the devils, can enter his realm. We need an assassin. We need you, Alison. I... How? How can I be? I'm a human. I couldn't possibly be as powerful as any of you. None of us can penetrate the ice. Only a being that bears flesh and blood can pass through the ice. That is how each set of six humans can enter, but their dead souls remain trapped. It is not too late to place you back into your body. In your earthly state, you can enter the ice. Your infiltration will go unobserved. Another six humans will soon be entering, as well. This activity will mask your arrival. How do I find those humans? What do I do to help them? Those humans are expendable. They are not your concern. Please. I don't... I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't understand any of this. I can't do what you think I can do. Believe me. I'm not the one you want. You are arrogant, more so than most others on Earth. Every uneducated speculation you form, you believe to be fact. I do not ask that you have faith in what you cannot sense. What I demand is that you believe in and respect the vastness of what you cannot comprehend. My being as you sense it is a result of your mind, your memories, your subconscious. That is the only way for me to communicate to you. Projecting my true existence to a human is impossible. It is the same within the ice. Everything you will sense there is derived from your mind. Be warned. You may be subjected to your deepest fears. He can find terrors you never knew you had. I watch Pam... a lot. When she leaves. When she comes home. I think she's really cool. Matt, she's not your type. She gets her money, her transportation, her drugs, everything comes from her boyfriends. She fucks a whole lot of guys so she doesn't have to do anything else. She do it with you? Couple times a while back. I was dealing a lot more back then. We met up, screwed, and I gave her some stuff two or three times but I decided I needed cash for my stuff, you know? I couldn't afford to be giving it away just to get laid. I should get her out of my brain? Get her out of your brain. Hey, where the hell is he? I've got better things to do than hang around here. I doubt that very severely. Believe it, shit head! I'm a busy man. You're part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! If that ain't Buck... It's going to be alright. Don't worry about it. Just chill out, Aaron! Hey buck, don't show up on time or anything. It's not like we've been waiting here all fucking night. You're late, Buck. What's the deal? I got tied up a little bit but trust me, it'll be worth it. How do I assassinate him? You cannot kill him yourself. You must make him remember his former life. You must make him recognize that he was once a human, a man capable of experiencing love. If he remembers, the ice containing his realm will begin to melt. The angels and the devils will soar through the openings in the dissolving ice walls. We will enter his domain and destroy him forever. How? How... how can I make him remember? Be patie‪nt, Alison. Go forward. Be strong. All of us are very special. This is an incredible gift. Buck. Our building. Our apartments. Can you help us or not? Yeah, man. We've been waiting all fucking night. I'm not really sure but I don't think you're going to have to worry about a place to live anymore. I've been working on rearranging, revising. I've been working really hard on this. I want it to be perfect. What the fuck is this? Take us! Take us! Take us! Take us! Take us!- -Buck, stop it! What is wrong with you? I don't believe this shit.- -Take us! Take us!- -Whats wrong with him? Is he sick or something? Take us!- -We wait around here for hours so he can show up and start acting like a fucking freak? Take us!- -Maybe we should call somebody! Take us!- -Buck, stop it! Stop it right now! Take us!- -God damn it! Shut the fuck up! Excuse me! Hello! Can you help me out? Please. I just have some questions. Look, I'm not from here. I'm looking for someone. A wizard's apprentice. His name's Abraham or it used to be. I've got to find him. He was brought here by his mentor who he recently killed. His mentor was a wizard named Ambolin. Here, within the ice, I was once very much like you were on Earth. But I chose better who to follow. Excuse me! I'm looking for- I... uh... Come on, man. Stay with me here. Be tough. I've got something for you. Okay. Here you go. That one? That one is going to make your sinuses expand. You're probably already feeling it right now. Your nose is kind of blocked up, finding it kind of hard to breathe? Way, way, way worse than any fuckin' cold you ever had, am I right? Now that one... that one's going to cause your tongue to swell up like a big, red, bumpy balloon. This is Pam. You suck. Leave a message. Hello? Is somebody there? Pick up, please! Come on! Pick up! Hello, Pam?- -Oh, thank God. I need help. I've got to get out of here.- -Sure, sure. You've just got to do me a favor first.- -I must be really fucking hammered. I don't even know where I am. Pam, I mean it! We'll figure out where you are. I'll come pick you up and I'll bring you home safe and sound but first, I want you to say my name. I... please... just- -Pam, you don't know who this is. How many guys know where you hide the spare key to your apartment? I feel so used! I feel dirty! Well, I guess I'll come pick you up anyway. I'll be right over. Wait a minute. You know where I am? I'm right behind you. Don't worry about a thing. You're going to be fine. Like I told you, I'm right behind you. There was one man. Different. He was your savior. He rescued you and your mother. You would have both starved most likely. You were fifteen years old. Do you remember? You knew he wanted your flesh. You gave it willingly. You loved him. His hands on your body, the taste of his skin. Why is this buried so far away, Pamela? What really made this man so different? Why did this haunt you for many nights after? Why couldn't you sleep? Why couldn't you eat? You loved him. You loved your mother's brother. You were so scared, Pamela. What if your were pregnant? Pregnant with your uncle's offspring. The child couldn't possibly be anything but an inbred monster. What if you were not the first to commit such an act? What if generations ago, blood impregnated blood? What kind of monsters lurk within you? You can let me go. Please. Please let me go. I can do things for you. You can let me go. I'm special. Yes, you are. Very special. Amazing! Amazing! For just a few dollars, you can see it for yourself! A freak of nature! One of God's mistakes! A repulsive beast! You've got to see it to believe it! Amazing! Amazing! For just a few dollars, you can see it for yourself! A freak of nature! One of God's mistakes! A repulsive beast! You've got to see it to believe it! Amazing! Amazing! For just a few dollars, you can see it for yourself! A freak of nature! One of God's mistakes! A repulsive beast! You've got to see it to believe it! Amazing! Amazing! For just a few dollars, you can see it for yourself! A freak of nature! One of God's mistakes! A repulsive beast! You've got to see it to believe it! Okay! Okay! Everybody out! The laws of society say we've got to kill it! All ugly things must die! Everybody's got to leave so we can put it out of it's misery! I... I... don't... You're not... you're not from here. I... I have friends with me. But I think three of them are dead. I don't know how I know. Can I do anything to help the ones that are still alive? I think as far as our world is concerned, all of us are already in our coffins. There's no way? Not at all? Is that how it works in here? Everywhere. I don't feel like we're the first. You're perceptive. This has been going on since the Dark Ages. You're just the most recent wave of victims. You're here to be thrown to the lions, killed for someone's entertainment. Can we do anything? Do we have any chance at all? There was one person who got out. It was during some battle for control, some fight over who would rule this dimension. So there is a chance for escape, I guess. So what can we do? How do we find this- I don't know! I don't understand this place either! I can't help you! I'm not even supposed to try! What does that mean? Not supposed to try? I was sent in here for a specific reason. A mission. I was told there would be a group of you in here with me. Your deaths are predetermined. If I try to help any of you, I could jeopardize my mission.- -You've got to try to help us! If you were sent here, you're not like the rest of us. You could help us! You could find a way for us to get out! You could challenge whoever runs this place! What I've got to do is important. I'm not supposed to help you. I'm supposed to stick to the mission! Fuck your mission! Don't you even care? I care! You're not even going to try to help! If I do what I was sent here to do, all of this will disappear. The killing will stop. I'd be saving countless lives! I will try to find my own way out. And if I can't find my way out, if they're going to try to kill me, I'm going to put up a fight. Well, I wish you luck. In the name of Ambolin, his apprentice, and the power within the ice... Amen. You can't have any of this. It's all mine. Excuse me! It's pretty fucking rude to leave before the performance! You've got to stay for the show. Big fucking presentation. They put a lot of work into it. Beautiful. When they pass the basket, I expect you to donate generously. God damn it, stop that fighting! If you can't behave, you're going to wait in your fucking cages next time! Time for the show. Dana, get over here with him! You're part of the show! You can drive the nails in. He can see that you're a sinner. He's always watching you, wherever you are! He knows what you do to yourself! You must obey! You must obey! Repent! Repent! Repent! Sinner! You must obey me! Obey! Dana. Dana, what's going on? Dana! Dana! Dana! Stop it! Stop it! You mother fucker! Stop! God damn it! You fucking coward! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop it! God damn it, you mother fucker! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Let her go! God damn you! You can save her. You fucking coward. Control yourself, Keith. Concentrate. Fix her. Babe. Dana. I'm sorry, sweetheart. Dana...? No... Those are worms squirming around inside your mouth. Already, they are secreting toxins. If you swallow, your stomach acid may kill them. If you try to keep them in your mouth, their secretions will poison your brain and you will lose bodily control. You won't have a chance. Keith, try to kill them. Now in your stomach, they could die. However, if they don't, they may be stimulated to secrete greater amounts of toxins that will circulate through your system very rapidly. You may begin to hallucinate. You may experience muscle spasms. Your lungs and heart may fail.- -Dr. Dana, you have a call on line six. Dr. Dana, you have a call on line six. I'll be back to check on you later. Two months ago, thirty-seven year old post office employee, John Q. Anyman, opened fire on his family with an illegal handgun. He massacred his thirty-two year old wife, Jane, and his two children, Bobby, age fifteen, and Sally, age nine. All were shot in the head, popping open their skulls and spraying blood and brain matter all over the living room. A stray bullet went through a window and then through the throat of Suzy Neighbor, age twenty-nine. She collapsed to the sidewalk convulsing, gurgling, spraying blood as her eight year old daughter watched in terror. Back inside, Anyman performed sexual activities with his daughter's corpse and cut off the head of his son. The killer then ordered pizza, and devoured most of a large sausage and Canadian bacon before anyone bothered to arrest him. Anyman went to court, pleaded stupidity, and was released a free man, but charged with a minimal fine for the mess he made. John Q. Anyman has now been offered 2.1 million dollars for his story, which will soon be produced as a network television movie. In a related story, new legislation has been passed to help those criminals who couldn't afford a good lawyer and subsequently couldn't avoid punishment for their various assaults, rapes, murders, and other trivial offenses. This new legislation will give even more rights to convicted criminals and get them back out onto the streets stalking your teenage daughter in no time. Do what I say, when I say it. We'll meet at the usual spot for the handoff. I'll give you the goods and the delivery address. If you're a good boy, we'll all make out like bandits. We'll all make out like bandits. If you fuck up, they'll kill you. If they don't, I will put a bullet in your head myself. I've got a lot riding on this, Aaron. Watch your step. Watch yourself. Watch your step. Hey. You supposed to meet somebody here? No. Who are you? Fuckin' moron. Wait a minute! Are you...? You're not from in here. You're one of the six. What are you talking about? This isn't real. You aren't where you think you are. You were pulled into this place. I've got an idea: fuck off. Don't you feel it? Like this is all isolated? Like you just drifted in? There's nothing before it, nothing after it? Like when you dream. Lady, drifting in and out of reality is like a fuckin' hobby to me. Let's cut all the bullshit. If you're not who I'm supposed to do business with, go away. Do you feel any of the others? You came in with five other people. Hey, I'm all alone here. Then you're the last one left alive. Who the fuck are you?! What the fuck are you doin' here?! Get out of here! Get the fuck out of here! Jesus. Do you know who that was? No idea. Alright. Listen up, alright? Tonight you're earning your money the hard way. I want you to take this to the address I gave you, alright?- -You didn't give me an address. Stop playin' fuckin' games, alright? You got a job to do, so do it! You know, you're not running from Schubert's men or any of those idiots in Harrison's gang. You've got some real problems here, so you better get your shit together, huh? And you better do it fast. Because they can be here any minute. Who could be here any minute now? Aaron! You know, you're going to have to start figuring things out on your own here, huh? Kill or be killed. Take or lose what's yours. Chase or run like hell. Now do your homework. You okay? I steal from your mind, Aaron. The images. The beings. The questions. The demons you must slay are behind your eyes. The ice that imprisons you now contains the same demons you battled against on Earth. Bullets snapping past your face. Blood draining into gutters. The sound of bone breaking. The smell of flesh rotting. Fear. Betrayal. Cold. Garbage. Needles. Escapes. Returning to the start of the circle. Dealers fucking you. Police fucking you. Friends fucking you. Hope. Dreams. Faith. Fucking you. Now, welcome to the final round. You are strong. Stronger than the other five. So swim to the surface with me. The clarity. The purity. The final battle. A battle behind your eyes. What are you?! How are you doing this?! Doing what?! Keeping me out! I was not selected to be here. You can't touch me because you didn't bring me in.- -You're a weak, pathetic little pest. You're a mortal human being. You're feeble. You did not enter the ice on your own. Something sent you here. Your name is Abraham. Think back. Think. Remember. Your name is Abraham. You are confused. That is a name of a character I once played. No, you've got to remember. Please, try. I can read nothing about you. I cannot get inside. I don't know where you came from, how you got here, if it was by accident. I do not even know if you have a name. You're the first to enter this realm without my knowledge. I should probably just kill you but I'm not sure that would be within the rules. If you talk to me, answer my questions, make yourself less of a mystery, I can guarantee your safety. As I said, you are a first. At the very least, you offer a break in the repetition. I find you interesting. Alison. My name is Alison. You do understand that you are different from any of the other beings in here. Everyone you've seen, they are my slaves, puppets. They are the souls of everyone who has entered this world and lost their life. Your existence here represents the only other real flesh and blood within this dimension. This world simply better utilizes a plan created by your God in Heaven. Reincarnation. When a player dies, they are reincarnated, appearing as whatever I choose, depending on the next player who will confront them. Have you ever thought of what kind of person you will be reincarnated as? I don't believe in reincarnation. Do you understand how you came to be here?- -No, I don't. Was it your decision to leave your world? Yes. I guess it was. An escape. And you've landed in paradise. Are you here because you desire to join me? I invite you, Alison, to share this all with me. You and I, ruling as one. I'm more powerful than anything you've ever encountered. I have a world at my feet. You, Alison, could taste what I taste. I've been what you've been. So I know. It tastes sour. You are a worthless animal! You are the defecation of a stupid god! You don't have the intelligence to realize you have never been, and never will be as powerful as- You're not powerful! You're weak! You're pathetic! The wizard was a failure and you followed his lead! You couldn't make it in the real world, so you traded it in for this one! That's not the way it really was! You are worthless, inferior! Someone has been filling your head with these stories. I want you to name the source of this blasphemy. They tell you these things because they are jealous. They want me out because I have more power than they could ever possess. That's why they lied to you, Alison. That's why they sent you in here. Now tell me where you came from! I came from the same place as you! We lived in the same air. We drank the same water. We both had the same idea we'd never succeed, never reach our goals. I thought I knew everything. I thought I knew my future and I thought I'd get nothing but shit for the rest of my life. But I don't know my future. Not like you, here in this place. You know exactly how things are going to happen because you control it! And self-serving control is for cowards!- -Control is for leaders. What are you leading?! You know nothing about leadership!- -I know what you think leadership is! It's not about power! It's dealing with what's thrown at you, dealing with the unknown!- -You were unable to battle the unknown! You escaped! We escaped! Both of us! But I didn't steal another life! You escaped with the promise of reward! I fucking locked myself away, took a knife in my hands and cut open my wrists! Both of us were weak. Both of us thought we knew our future. Both of us didn't think we could change our future. But now I'm here looking at you. A coward who took the life of a woman who loved you, trusted you. And I know my mistakes are minor compared to your cowardly actions. You... Could you have taken your own life?! Could you do what I did?! No. You're too selfish, even for that! You're too weak to do what I did. Cutting my own wrists! Spilling my own blood! My own blood, you fucking coward! You... You... I own this world. I own these powers. And now I own the woman who I had to give up to gain everything else. And you don't believe in reincarnation. No!!! No!!! Alison. Listen to me. Close your eyes. You have performed well, Alison. And you are to be rewarded. We are giving you a choice. You may now continue and enter your next phase. You may do so without the standard punishments you would otherwise have to endure for committing suicide. Or you may return to your world for a second chance at your life. The decision is yours, Alison. You may take a few moments to evaluate your options.
