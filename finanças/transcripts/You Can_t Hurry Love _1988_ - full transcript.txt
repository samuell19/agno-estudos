No, that's not what I meant. No, I know exactly what you meant. You want some poor woman to lug around your kid for 9 months. Do you have any idea what it's like to be pregnant? No. You expect us women to wash, cook, and clean for you, then spend all night having sex like crazed monkeys. No. That's not fair. That's not fair? I'll tell you what's not fair. What's not fair is this whole idea of the mating ritual. That a woman of my quality has to stoop as low as going to a dating service to get a date, while men like you pick and choose which ones you're going to marry? I mean, what is it? You think women are like animals just waiting around for men like you to show us domination? 'Cause I can show you something about domination. Wait a minute. What are these things doing on my feet? Why are these cameras on? This is the mating ritual, and you are my mate. No! What are you doing!? Lady! Leaving so soon? Ha ha ha! Now, Chuck, try to be diplomatic. Diplomatic? If I tell my son it's day and it's night, then it's day. Mace, you shut up. Now just shut up. Don't tell me to shut up. Shut up, Macie. Ohh, shit! Get up, get up, get up! ( Doorbell ringing ) Get up quick! My parents are here. Get up! What? - My parents. - What about 'em? They're here. The girls. Well, they can't have 'em, they're mine, now get out of here. Oh, my god! Eddie? Is that you? Okay. Ah! Aah! Eddie? Mom, dad. How the hell are you? Ed. What the hell's going on here? Whose place is this? This place? Oh, it's Skip's. He's house-sitting for this guy. Son, why do you have a towel on your head? Towel? Oh. Well, I just took a shower, so I'm going to go finish drying off, okay? Excuse me. Whew. Ah! Eddie. Eddie, honey? Did you say something? No, mom. I'm just going to take a shower. Didn't you just take a shower? Um, yeah, but it gets really dirty in L.A. So, I'll be right out, okay? Who is that? My mother, shh. Shh. Wait, wait... Go that way. Go that way. Shh. Be cool. Okay? Please. - Photographer: Right. - ( Dishes clank ) That's nice, very nice. Okay. Ooh, beautiful. Salute again, please. Oh, love it, love it. Ooh! Dear, I think we better wait for him back at the motel. Come on. There it is. Thanks. Mom, dad, what's wrong? You're coming home. What? That? I can explain that. This isn't mine. It's Skip's. - Where is Skip? - He's out of town. Then, who was that girl? What girl? That girl. That's Skip's fiancee. And what about the naked girl in the backyard? Right. What naked girl? I can explain everything. Why don't you just go back to the hotel and I'll come over. Son. Son, you've got to stop sowing wild oats. Darling, forget about Joanie. You'll get over that. Look, you're on the next plane back to Ohio, young man. No, dad. Baby. Baby, come home and live with us. Your daddy will give you your job back. Uh, what's that? Chuck, your son is wearing an earring. - Oh. - Ouch. That is the last straw. Dad, come on. Uncle Chuck, aunt Macie, welcome to Skip Dooley's practical jokes, blunders, and cockamamie gimmicks. I just have to say this, but I think in the history of this show, that was one of the best practical jokes we pulled off. What the... No, uncle Chuck, the camera's right over there behind the mirror. Now, why don't you two come on over here right next to me and say hello to the television audience. Come on. Speak right up. Oh, you're kidding. No. What are you talking... You mean, this is really... You mean we're on television? That's right. You're kidding. No, you see, I told Edward not to tell you about my new cable show. The show that puts everyday ordinary people into extraordinary situations. Macie: That's amazing. Say hi. Say hi, uncle Chuck. - Hi. - ( Chuckling ) Hello, we're from Ohio. Come on now, you're kidding. Ed, you never told us you worked in TV. The producers wouldn't let me. Ohh. Ohh. Oh, now I get it. All right, guys, that's a wrap. Thanks. You guys were just so good. Couldn't believe it. Mom, dad, listen, we'll go out to dinner later. Okay? So, why don't you go home, get some rest... ( Chattering ) Good-bye! Thanks, mom. Come on, Mace, he's a busy man. Come on, come on, come on, come on. You didn't fool me for a minute. Right, bye, dad. I can't believe that just worked. What is it we sell? The fantasy. Uh, excuse me, hi. I'm looking for a girl named Monique. Eddie. I was just wondering when you'd get here. You're Monique. I just loved your videotape. Which one? The one where you talk about how much you like racing fast cars and women. Uh, right, yeah. Anyway, listen. I have a slight problem. My parents just came into town and I have to go out with them, so, I'm afraid I'm going to have to break our date. Why? Are you afraid I would embarrass you? No. No, it's not that at all. It's just that, you know, they just came into town, and I have to have dinner with them. So, where are you having dinner? Croquet's. I love that place. I'll call Peno right now and get us the best table, all right? Yeah, sure. If you want to do that, that'd be great. - They'll love it. - Yeah? Believe me. And I'll love it even more. So, wait here, handsome. Hmm. ( Chuckles ) How cute. It looks just like a small penis. ( Chuckles ) If you rub up against it, it'll turn into a big Cadillac. - Good evening. - Ah. I'm Richard, your waiter. I'm going to explain this evening's menu to you. Please don't interrupt. As an appetizer, we have duck sausage on a pizza with salmon roe and tomatoes that have been dried in the Napa Valley sun. Duck pizza? Uh-uh. I asked you not to interrupt. Please save your questions until I'm finished, all right? Thank you. Then we have the pitage de fiddle fern. A fern that is organically grown and clipped alive from the evergreens in Colorado. What's that? Fiddle fern soup? ( Laughs ) Dad. You're embarrassing me. And for the main entree, we have grilled, free-range chickens. That means they have been raised in a stress-free environment, without fences or any loud noises. What the hell is he talking about? They got gay chickens out here? Shh. Stress-free chickens, dear. Sorry. Richard, could we have a bottle of your best champagne? It'll be a pleasure, madame. Make it two bottles. - Of course. - Thank you. Well, tell us about yourself, Monique. I'm what you call your typical Beverly Hills girl. You know, I grew up on the left bank and Rodeo Drive and Eddie is just so continental, so, savoir faire, that I just could not resist him. Our Eddie? Dad, your mouth is full. Sorry. You know, I just love a guy who knows how to race fast cars and climb mountains. Are you talking about him? Mom. You know about my hobbies. Oh, your hobbies. Oh! I could go on and on about Eddie's science project in high school. Did he tell you that he won first prize at the Patawatabe county fair? He grew the biggest ear of corn in the state. I believe it. Ooh! ( Coughs ) Oh, man. ( Laughs ) I had a bit of an accident. I'm sorry. Could you excuse me a second? I'm going to run to the bathroom. Excuse me. You can't believe what just happened out there. I don't know what I'm going to say, I mean... Monique, you're not supposed to be in here. Why not? Because it's the men's room, and those are my parents out there. What do you think you're doing? But that's what makes it fun. The thrill of doing it in front of others. I thought you liked thrills. I do, but I thought we were going to go out and have dinner and then maybe fumble with our clothes later. Oh, just an old-fashioned. How cute. ( Moaning ) ( Man coughing ) Oh. We were just leaving. Come on. Let's go. We got to go. I'm sorry. She wasn't feeling well. I had to take care of her. Mom. Monique. - Bye. - Bye. - Have fun. - See you later. ( Warbles ) - Thank you. - Always a kidder. Bye, mom, bye, dad. ( Tires screech ) You know what? What? I get the feeling that we're not supposed to be here. Don't be silly. I practically live here. Would you mind doing me a teensy weensy favor? Uh-oh. What? Would you mind putting this on? ( Chuckles ) That's very funny. Pretty please? Are you serious? It really turns me on. Really turns me on. Well, if it turns you on... It turns me on. ( Breathing ) Monique? Monique? I'm over here. ( Hums "Jaws" theme ) ( Laughing ) ( Sighs ) I feel like I'm going deep sea fishing. You are. Yeah? ( Moaning ) Harry, look at this. Oh, my god. Fuck me. Fuck me. What's going on? What are they selling? ( Moaning ) Fuck me. Okay. Ready? ( Crowd gasps ) ( Man chuckles ) Aah! ( Chattering ) Where did I go wrong? Mom, I'm so sorry. It's not your fault. My son, having sex in front of 1,000 people. It was six, tops. Chuck, it's all your fault. If you hadn't let him come out here to get corrupted. In fact, if your mother were alive today to see what you have done to her grandson... Oh, shut up. Let's just get the hell out of here. You shut up. And don't you ever tell me to shut up again. Never, as long as you live. And you... You just wait until I tell my sister back in Cleveland how you're living out here. It's disgusting. Have a nice trip, aunt Macie. Mace, just get in the car. Dad. ( Chuckles ) Shh, shh, shh. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. It'll all blow over, okay? Just give her a couple of weeks. I'll handle it. Hmm? Hmm? Okay, dad. I love you. I love you. Sucker. Mom, I'll call you tomorrow, okay? ( Engine starts ) See you, Chuck. Okay? Skip: You know, Eddie, you're really depressing me. Eddie: This has been the most embarrassing night of my life. Okay, look, but I got a plan, okay? See, your ad agency is throwing a party this weekend at the house. What? Our house? That's right, our house. You see, every time these big honchos from out of town come in, they throw this party, so what I want you to do is, you get one of these video chicks, you bring her to the party, you impress the shit out of her, and then maybe you'll get laid, and it might even be in a bed. Hi. Well, if it isn't Romeo again. It's 2:30. You're an hour late. I know, I had a rough night. What happened? Her husband come home too early? I'm sorry. I'll let her know you're here. Video Valentine, take 429. Rolling. Action. Hello, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Edward Hayes III, I am looking for a young, urban, professional woman who isn't into one night flings, who would enjoy eating white wine and brie while we watch a Polo match. Or perhaps a drive in my Jaguar, or maybe yours, and then, as we're standing of the bow on my yacht, I'll turn to you and say. Voulez, voulez vu de voulez, vu? ( Playing "La Cucaracha" ) ( Chattering ) It's a little bit different. I'm just going to go touch up my makeup. I'll be back in a minute, okay? Okay. Whoa, look at you. Nice going, man. She's beautiful. Thank you. Yeah, she's really great. You keep your hands off her, okay? What am I going to do? Try to pick up your girl? I'm your cousin, man. I wouldn't do that. Listen, she's nice. She likes me. Look, I think this is your night. Why? There's some very important people here from Vidiocity, especially the head of the New York office, Kelly Bones. - You have to talk to her, it's very important. - All right. As soon as she gets here, I'm going to point her out to you, okay? Yeah. - See you later man, have fun. - All right, Skip. Oh, my god. Peggy. Peggy? How are you doing? What are you doing here? Well, if it isn't Don Juan. What are you doing here? Me? Well, I happen to live here. Sure, just like the movie studio and the rock band. I know, I know. But it's true. I live here. I happen to know that an advertising agency owns this place and they rent it out to my friend Jeff for photo sessions. - Really? - Yeah. He's a friend of yours? - Yeah. - Well, I know. They do some work here, but I live here. I don't know whether to believe you or not. Well.. I guess it doesn't matter. No. You want to get a drink? Anyway, weren't you here with someone? Hmm? Yeah, I am and she happens to be my perfect match. She's not perfect. She is going out with you. Just kidding. So, I guess you won't be coming in anymore. - No, I guess not. - Too bad. I was starting to look forward to your tapes. God knows why. Well, I was starting to look forward to our little discussions. God knows why. Well, you found Ms. Right. ( Chuckles ) But you found Mr. Right. So, why are you sitting here with me? Because I like the way the chive's stuck between your teeth. No. I'm just kidding. Eddie. She's here. Hmm? Oh... Skip, Peggy. - Hi. - Hi. Okay. I'll be right there. - Come on. - Okay, okay. Thanks. Well. Bye. Bye. What do you do? I'm an actor/psychic. Really? So am I. Both: I should have known that. Kelly, Kelly, Kelly. ( Laughing ) Kelly: Well, it's not as if Jack doesn't have my number. It was his idea to have dinner. I'll call him, I'll talk to him. - I'll bury him. - ( Both chuckle ) Did you see the look on their faces when you sold them on coupons for the blind? ( Laughs ) What a concept. Concepts, Newcomb, are everything. If you don't have a concept, you don't have a product. Hi. Who are you? Hayes. What are you doing here? I live here. Ms. Bones, Ed Hayes, I work for you. You do? Yeah, as a matter of fact, I'm in charge of alternate media. Newcomb, tell you about that? No, he didn't. You little rascal. What's this all about? Uh, he's in, uh... Handbills and flyers. This is my wife, Betty. Hi. How do you do? Excuse me. Yes. Ms. Bones? I'm going after the MTV generation. Now, that's like the zero generation, just a bit more yuppie. Mm-hmm. Well, you seem to know a lot about advertising. What other firms have you been with? Well. In Cleveland I was with a very small firm. You've probably never heard of them. Oh, sure I have. No, they were very small. Well, was it Pinky and Chico? Hmm? Yeah. That's it. Pinky and Chico. Huh. I was the head of their youth department. Nice try, kid. Pinky and Chico are my dogs. Oh, don't worry, I like a man who lies. But just not to me. Newcomb... Promote this kid. I want to see him in the staff meeting Monday morning. ( Stammers ) But... Kelly. Don't but me, Newcomb, just do it. Thank you. Thank you very much. Don't thank me, Ed, just be there. Yes, ma'am. Hayes, you little twerp. Chill out. Okay. Half-hour. All right, bye. There you are. I've been looking all over for you. Yeah? Well, I've been making a little bullshit go a long way. No kidding? Um, let me talk to her a second. I'll be right there, okay? Okay. Okay, bye. You leaving? Yeah. Well, I was hoping maybe we could talk, you know, a little bit more. With who? Mr. Multiple Personalities? Are you talking about what happened in there? Okay. I didn't want to lie to that lady, but it just goes to show that sometimes it's better not to tell the whole truth. Look, Eddie, it really was nice talking to you, bu you got a girl, remember? Come on, Peggy, let's go. Well, you better get going. You don't want to keep your boyfriend waiting, do you? No. I don't. Bye. Sorry. I'm sorry about that. Who was that? Oh, it was just this girl who was just bothering me all night. Why don't you take me on a tour of the house? Tour of the house? I'd like that. Are you talking about Rick? The one with the curved weenie? Curved? That thing goes around corners before he does. I haven't been able to walk straight for a week. ( Laughs ) I'm going to go put this on. I'll be back in a minute, okay? Okay. So, I'm off the coast of Jamaica, right? I'm in this cigarette boat, I don't realize how badly wounded I am. I'm going 150 miles an hour on the water. I'm just slamming into the waves, I'm, like, plunging into darkness, you know? There's foam... it's spraying all over my chest and down. ♪ You're the one I dream of when I go to sleep at night ♪ ♪ You're fun to be with... ♪ Well, what do you think? Unbelievable. Does the name Penod mean anything to you? Yes. That was my name in a previous life. - Oh, my god. - Oh, my god. Sylvia? Penod, what happened to you? You went out for a bundle of sticks, you never came back. Sylvia, it rained for 40 days and 40 nights, okay? Mmm, mmm, mmm. Wait. Wait. What? I'm not the guy in the video tape. I mean, I am the guy, it was me, but that's not me because I don't have any money, and I don't have a Jaguar, and I don't have a yacht. I don't even eat brie. I hate brie. Look, I just want you to like me for me. I do. I like a man who's honest. Kiss me. ( Moaning ) Man: See that dog over there? You mean Spuds MacKenzie, the party animal? That's not Spuds MacKenzie. That's his look-alike. - That's the kinda bullshit that goes down in this town. - I'll say. Look at him, working the room. ( Moans ) Tracey. Man: Tracey? ( Tracey moaning ) Ahem! Excuse me, Buckwheat. - ( Chuckles ) - Do you know this guy? Grow up, Sparky. At least he didn't stand me up three nights in a row. Uh-oh. Don't ever talk to me like that again. Don't flex your muscles around here, we're not impressed. I'm impressed. You're history, pally. The party's over. Oh, grow up. You're such a child. I'll be back for your lesson in a minute. Let's go, knuckle beat. Yes, sparky. Come on, get out. Eddie: ( Grunting ) Please! You having fun yet? ( Grunting ) Oh! Oh, man. Well, that must hurt. Guess it wasn't your night after all. Huh? You know, I got some bad news this morning. Your mom called my mom. No more trust fund, no more checks, no more credit cards. You mean with your winning smile and your "hey, dude" attitude, you couldn't bullshit your parents anymore? ( Laughs ) Hey, man, why don't you ease up here a little? Okay? I mean, my chicks have run off with some producer at the party last night. Well, someone must have come along with a better line of B.S. So much for your style over substance. Now what are you going to do? I don't know. I have never been this close to reality before. I'll do something though. I'm going to come up with some scam. I don't know, but... You got any ideas? - Huh? - Yeah. Maybe you could get off your ass and do something constructive with your life instead of walking around pretending to be something you're not and acting like such an asshole. That's a wrong answer. That is a wrong answer from you, Eddie. I don't need this shit. You know that? I grow exotic herbs in Oregon, and I'm looking for a special girl, you know, like the kind of girl who can rebuild a carburetor... I like old movies... Into French cuisine, Greek culture, and water sports, if you know what I mean. ...just like a little wisp of pubic hair. I like a girl with a big ego. Oh, yeah, and bodybuilding. Bodybuilding? Yeah, yeah. Well, I've won a couple of contests. What? Mr. Pacoima. More like Mr. Potato Head. Receptionist: Hi. Can I help you? Woman: Uh, yes, I had this video made, and unfortunately... Eddie. What happened? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I just had a little on-the-job accident. Eddie. Something I kind of wanted to talk to you about. What? It's about, um, me and my lifeguard. Peggy, tell me. No, never mind. It's nothing. I got to go. I'll talk to you later, okay? Yeah, sure. What happened to you? Hang gliding. Next time you ought to hang on to the glider. ( Laughs ) Hang on to the glider. Hey, what are they filming train wrecks here now? Hey. Keep it down out here. I can't hear myself breathe. Well, if it isn't little Romeo. Yes, ma'am. It's my last time. Oh, well, it's lucky you came by today because we're closed tomorrow in honor of the great occasion, right, Peggy? Right. Aw, what the hell, you've paid your dues, kid. You go next. - Wait a minute. - I've been here... Hey! Or she'll bail you out of jail. Cut. Time's up. Ha ha. I think we have all we need, Mr. Kaminsky. - Thank you. - Thank you. Now, if this is your last visit, Ed, it's your last chance for romance. So, let's be up and sexy. No one ever got a date by being a dud. Are you a dud? Yeah. Mm-hmm. That a boy. Of course not. Action. Look. I just have one thing I want to say to you women out there. Whatever happened to old-fashioned romance? I mean, it used to be two people could meet, maybe they'd fall in love, but now that can't happen, 'cause nobody knows who they are anymore. So, what is it, is it me? I don't know. Hey, wake up out there, I'm talking to you. Listen, why do people have to make up who they are in order to be liked? You would think that in this crazy world, there'd be a simple way for two people to meet and fall in love, but no, that's not possible, because in order to get ahead you have to make up some cockamamie persona. Why can't we get past what kind of cars we drive and what we look like and what kind of jobs we have? That stuff isn't important. Listen, it seems to me that the reason why there's so many single people in the world is because nobody wants to open their hearts anymore. Look, everyone has the right to fall in love, and I just don't think you should have to make up who you are in order to do it. That's it. I give up. Beautiful, kid. That'll be 60 bucks. Whoa. Unbelievable. Hey, Tony. You're late! I know, I know, I know. It's... I don't know, man, I don't think I'm going to be working here anymore. I think I'm going to head out of town. I'm out of here. Uh-huh. Yeah, right? So, where you goin'? I don't know. I don't know. I just don't think L.A.'s for me. You know? Probably go home for a little while. See what's going on. At least I understand the people there. Can I ask you a question? How come you live in that box? Come here, I'll show you something. Wow. See, everybody lives in a box, Eddie. Now, nobody envies me, I have everything I need, and I make a lot of money on the side copywriting for my brother. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Now, I heard that you used to sweep mines in Granada. Yeah. Well, I made that up. See, in this town you can make up whoever you want to be. I heard that. See, my problem is, what do you do when you don't know who you want to be? Well, it seems to me if you just keep on the road you're on, you'll find out. Look, I'm gonna go, okay? My brother called. He wants to know if you're going to be at that Monday meeting. You want to work for them? Monday meeting, really? I don't know. I kind of got in under false pretenses. You know? There's nothing wrong with false pretenses as long as you know the difference. You could be right. Send me a card. All right, I'll think about it. See you later, Tony. So long, kid. Yeah, what do you think? You look great, man. Why are you dressed up? Well, you see, I thought about what you said, and I got a job. Job? ( Laughs ) Yeah. You got a job? Yeah. I'm driving a limo, man, it is so big, man. The possibilities are endless. Well, I'm proud of you, man. What are you doing here, man? I'm going home. L.A. is not for me, so... Wait, wait. Are you crazy? Have you listened to the phone machine? No. Why? You got about 100 calls from chicks. You got to... come here. This phone has been ringing off the hook. I mean, I don't know what you did at that video service, but whatever you did, it worked. Listen. Woman: Hello, Eddie? I just saw your tape, and you are the most sexy and honest guy I have ever seen. Call me, Donna K05-2021. ( Beeps ) Woman: Hi there, I was just on the dating service, and I just saw your tape. You know, nobody has ever affected me that way in my life before. You are so incredibly sensuous. I hope you call me because I can touch your heart just the way you touched... ( Beeps ) That's great, but it doesn't really matter, 'cause I'm out of here. Wait, wait, wait. Don't give up here, man, because Peggy Kellogg called. Remember her? The party? Listen. ( Rewinding ) ( Beep ) Peggy: Hi. This is Peggy Kellogg. Um, I've never done this before, but I just wanted to call you and tell you I really admired what you said. I'm sorry I misjudged you. I really wish I had known that part of you before, because I really like you. Anyway, I wish things had turned out differently between us. Bye. ( Beeps ) Yeah. Oh, my god. What a jerk. She doesn't sound like a jerk. No, man. Not her, me. I got to talk to her. I got to talk to her right now. So, what's stopping you? So, so, what do I do? We talk to her. We find her.
