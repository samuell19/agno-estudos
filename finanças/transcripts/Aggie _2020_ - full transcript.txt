[indistinct radio chatter] [light pop music] - Renowned philanthropist and art collector, Aggie Gund, stunned the art world when she sold "Masterpiece," a 1962 painting by Roy Lichtenstein, for $165 million in July-- not because she sold it, but what she used the money for. Gund used the proceeds to start the "Art For Justice Fund" to combat mass incarceration. [upbeat classical music] - Aggie is many things to many people. - Collector, philanthropist, arts lover, extraordinary woman. - Cool. Aggie's super cool. - A soul mother. - Aggie has always been there for the new kind of art. She doesn't question it. She gets behind it. - Aggie's collection reflects her own taste, art that she sees and loves. Everyone else catches up quite a bit later. - This woman has done more for the art world-- and particularly women in the art world-- than any other human being. - We have among us one of the great firefighters for justice in America. Her name is Agnes Gund. [applause] - What do you think of this film? - I hope that the film will... not be seen by too many people. [dreamy music] ♪ - You can learn so much by looking at art. You can learn about different aspects of life. You can learn about people and how they see the world. And everyone can know the same thing. It doesn't involve having to know any language except that of looking. ♪ In Renaissance art in Italy, you see via landscape and the way somebody painted it is not the way somebody else sees it. But it gives you a whole nother view of that landscape. And it translates to modern art. For instance, Mark Rothko, always when I'm looking at a space in the outdoors, I really see the shapes that he has. Sometimes I think of the clouds that I see as Georgia O'Keeffe clouds. I like the vibrance of it. I like the discovery of things. I like the way it compares to the world for me. I didn't really learn much about modern art until I had a wonderful teacher, Sarah MacLennan, who really imbued a love of discovery through being in museums of all kinds, like small ones like the Isabella Stewart Gardiner which she loved. The Frick, the Phillips Collection. She taught me that you could go to any number of places and get tremendous joy from seeing art. [indistinct chatter] - We're crossingthrough the park and going to the west side. - We're going through the park? - Yes. - Isn't this great? This is an empty street. - Can you tell me about going to galleries and studio visits and, like, what those things mean. - We used to really have some time to see the studio, see where the people, you know, made something. - How do they get arranged? The studio visit. - You just called the person up. - [chuckles] Hi, welcome to my studio. How are you doing? - I'm doing fine. - You're okay. Well, this ismy little New York space. A studio visit is a chance for people to come into my space and talk to me about what I'm thinking about. Because you can go to an art fair or a gallery and see, like, many final products, but a studio visit is a time to share creative thought. This is the first time you've been to my studio. - Yes, it is. - Hi. - It's great. - Thank you. - But what are these? - So, I'm doing a project looking at Jacob Lawrence's migration series. With someone like Aggie, you know that this person's laid eyes on many different types of work. It's going to be 120 panels referencing the colors and then I'm trying to answer the text in contemporary terms. - Oh, that's good. So, you'll have an epic thing. - I want an epic thing. While I think most artists are very intimidated to having someone like Aggie in the room, Aggie also becomes vulnerable and then naturally, there's an opening of awareness. Because she's constantly putting herself in different scenarios. I know, this is-- it's a lot, Aggie. I really wanted to understand blackness, whiteness, how it was constructed. America has really recorded its history quite well to the point whereyou don't have to look that far to understand how we went from slavery to mass incarceration. - This doesn't really have anything to do with that. - Why do you say that? - Well, I mean, he's harvesting these leaves, tobacco leaves, I gather. - Mm-hmm. I think that it's basically the same characters. It's just this man probably could have been lynched if he had trespassed in some kind of way. To me, black Americans are just continuously in migration because the poverty is so extreme which is tied to slavery and that's all tied to the Black Codes. - I see what you're trying to do. It hasn't changed so much. I think there should be reparations. It seems a very hard question to answer because how are you going to knead it out? - Mm-hmm. - It will take a huge amount of people to work on this. - It would be like a whole package. - I think it's only right that it should be that way. - The world is a new place, Aggie. We've changed the world. Bye, Aggie. - Bye. - Thank you. - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. We didn't even get to talk about dating. Later. [stately string music] ♪ - I was born in Cleveland.

And she supported artists through commission and innovation and collecting. Relax your face. Relax, relax, relax. Right there, good. There's something really beautiful about being strong and being a woman who is aging who is, like, unbelievably iconic. [camera clicking] Yeah, that's nice. When you think about growing up post-World War II, raising a family, and even how that was sold, it is about how she has broken the code of the housewife and what is the expectations of it. Right there with me. That's perfect. Beautiful. - Did you want to have lots of children? - I would have probably had ten children, but then the reality dawned. - [chuckles] - After I had Anna, I decided I really couldn't have any more because I couldn't manage that many children. Your father didn't want a vasectomy, so I had to have my tubes tied. So, that's what I did. I just think things got worse and worse. We never confronted the fact together. I knew I had to get a divorce because it just wasn't very easy to be in that marriage. So, I was living in Concord, Massachusetts, with my four children. My marriage was over and I needed to be where I belonged.

[bright jazz music] - I look at my work as being something anti-art or anything that's different from the mainstream of paintings since the Renaissance. - Aggie, what was he like, to know him as an artist? - One could put him down by saying it was just a parody of the comics. To me, it was much more. - I use a mirror to see the painting reversed and when you suddenly look in the mirror, the things that are wrong to you seem to be more emphasized because you're seeing the image as though you're seeing it for the first time. It's just a sense that a line has to be changed, and I just change it. [music playing] - I could never separate his work from him as an artist.

And when we brought it down from Concord and moved to New York and hung it, I thought, "Well, this has got to be the right place for it," and it gave me the same happiness, as well as I loved it as a painting, that Roy did and his wife, Dorothy, who I think always made everyone feel good about knowing them and being with them. - Do you think you're going to want to see a rough cut of this movie?

What's a good lesbian? - What is a good lesbian? - How many of these conversations have you done? - Okay now, I have to ask you a question.

Rage, fury, or even empathy. If we're able to understand those things through art, perhaps we might be able to sympathize, you know, with their situation in ways that can benefit our lives. - So often, the only tool children are given is destruction. When I felt like something was more than I could handle, the Studio gave me creativity as a tool. I could look into chaos and find a pattern. - So that's why I try to blend-- - Bam. - You are being told, sometimes for the first time, your words have value and as someone who is told that who I am in society is meant to be voiceless and small, to have a space where someone's saying, "No, we want to hear what you think," that was monumental. ♪ - I remember Roy was on the board very early. - Mm-hmm. - And of course, board meetings weren't his thing.

It's so wonderful to have Wyn, and David, and my brothers, and my kids here. Every night before I go to sleep, I say my prayers, though, you know, many people don't think that's proper, but it makes me go to sleep. Many people pray to ask God for things they need or want, but I've always begun my prayers, since being older, with thanks for the great blessings in my life, namely my family. The reason that I'm telling you this is that, as president of the museum, I all too often have to ask for things. Money, art, involvement. But tonight, I would just like to thank God for the blessing that is the museum. But the museum has never been about the physical buildings. It has always been about the people who fill those buildings. First and foremost, the artists.

It made me really, really happythat he would do a film that was so much about why are we so anti-black or racist at that point? - Its message is mind your own business really and, like, don't judge other people until you know about it and exaggerate what people use against you and turn it into a style and win. Maybe that's why Aggie likes it. - It was, you know, an experience I had seen first-hand with Cleveland, blacks being so separate from whites. I guess I had that sympathy for that film. It was marvelous he did it that way. - Hey Penny, see the colored boy? The cute one? His mother is Motormouth Maybelle! - He's gorgeous! - She would learn to understand art even if she doesn't like it. That's why there was so much goodwill towards her. - I think the biggest gift I've always felt from you has been your supportof divergent voices. Obviously you've supporteda lot of people in a way but you've always insistedthat people's voices are relevantand if they can defend them, should be at the table.

A lot of them are nude, just flying around in the sky. They aren't like the one in the Raphael painting where they're looking over.

Many of them are just told that they have to plead guilty or they'll get a higher sentence, which seems absolutely wrong. - The Bureau of Justice predicts that one in three black male babies born in this country is expected to go to jail or prison. It doesn't matter whether you're poor, whether you live in the country,whether you live in the city, whether your grandparents were sharecroppers or tenant farmers or yourgrandparents are art collectors.

Art for Justice provides grants to a wide variety of artists, activists and organizations who are working together to reform our criminal justice system. The goal is to make communities safer, keep families together and treat people with dignity and compassion. The fund ultimately supports a mass movement that is marching towards justice in this country.

Most people who have itpretend like they don't have it and she said, I have this and I want it to go to work. I want it to be so, so much bigger than one painting. - Aggie understands that art makes it possible for us to have empathy and that without empathy, there is no justice. all: No more jail, no more jails. No more jail, no more jails! No more jail, no more jails! - This investment is so rare and critical, we're going to leverage it.

There's so much fear and anxiety in prison, but to be able to create, being in solitary, kind of cut through all of that which really solidified for me the importance of just being an artist. - For so many years,I wasn't able to take my family to vote because I couldn't vote. I wasn't able to lead my family to a precinct. I can do that now.

We need them to be engaged in this collective struggle. That's why I'm so excited about the Art for Justice Fund. If we stand up when people say, "Sit down," we can create a movement that truly allows real justice to prevail. - Somebody said to me they don't think prison is an unjust system. - Right, the thingsyou care about are contested.

I haven't seen that Lichtenstein but tonight it becomes a medal of honor for those of us who are trying to change things, who are trying to do justice, and I just want to say from the bottom of my heart, Miss Gund, I'm glad you were willing to say, "I'm here." - The people I love the best jump into work head first without dallying in the shallows and swim off with sure strokes almost out of sight.
