Translated and timed by yuizaki_libra Thanks to Okita for rough timing and nomanymore for the raw. Ready? Go! Happy birthday, Yo-chan. Happy birthday. Yo-chan. Take this. What is that? Stealing a march on us is sneaky! Let's go play! Let's go play! Yozo-bochama. (bochama = young master) I wish you a happy birthday. Yeah. As today is a special occasion, Hirame me has received Master's order to let you ride the carriage. Amazing! This is to celebrate your birthday. Thanks, Hirame. May you have a happy birthday. I am sorry for having been born. No Longer Human Watanabe! Yes! Oba! Yes! Ouch! If only Oba weren't here, we would have become a pretty good class, right guys? On purpose, on purpose. You did that on purpose right? I can see through that though. Okay, next. Otsu! Yes! You...? Why on earth are you here? After I told them I'm Yozo's close friend... They gave me so many yummy sweets~ You... when did you become my close friend? Who's that over there? Anesa. She's my cousin. Yo-chan... ...you will help me, won't you? We should just leave this house together. Help me will you? Help me! You got it on with her? You idiot. Ouch! My ear hurts. Ouch.. It hurts huh? It hurts! It hurts huh? It hurts! Sorry for behaving that way to you. I'm sure you will be.. very popular with girls. Anesa. Eat this. If you have some interesting book, lend me. Thanks for the treat. It's a ghost drawing. A ghost. A ghost. Then.. how about this? It's certainly a drawing of ghost? It's terrific~ This horse of Hell looks great. As I thought, you can understand it. I also want to be able to draw ghost drawings like this one. I've never shown anyone this before... but I will show it to you. This ghost... was drawn by you? My ghost.. I am the ghost. You will become an excellent artist. Like this, it looks a little better now. Won't you lend me 5 yen? I'm Horiki Masao. You are? I'm Oba Yozo. Okay! Let's go have some drinks. I'll be treating you. Since the first time I saw you in the drawing school, I have always taken notice of you. Drink up! It's my treat. There there. That bashful smile of yours, that's the facial expression only possessed by a promising artist. An expression that tells both the ecstasy and the insecurity of someone who was chosen. Women are weak in front of these hands. Hey, Ritsuko-san. Hmm? Oba is a handsome man, isn't he? You mustn't fall for him, alright? Well now, let me see. I easily fall for people with a lovely face. Oh shoot! Dangerous, dangerous! I've been thinking that I'd like to enter an art school. Nah, that's boring. Schools are boring. Toss that school thing out of your system. Welcome. Hey Ibuse-san. Look, Kobayashi-san too.. Even Dan Kazuo-san's here. All the dignitaries are coming together. Here. Even Dan Kazuo-san's here. All the dignitaries are coming together. Here. What the, Horiki huh? Nakahara.. You're tricking a newbie again? Stop that. Hey young boy. I'll "take care" of you. Dan-san. I leave the manuscript in your care. What an eyesore. You are only a fool who tries to speak politely, making that face of a mackerel floating about in the sky. Generally speaking, which flower is your favorite? Huh? What on earth is your favorite flower? Peach flowers. That's why you are... Enough Nakahara! I got it. But this chap hasn't understood. Hey. What color does war have? Take a guess. I don't know. The color of war is brown. Brown? That's right. War and feces both have a brown color. Nakahara, let's go back? I'm not going back. Let's go back together. You're too noisy. If you want to go back, just go back alone. You're strong. I'll remember this for the rest of my life. You call him an ingenious poet? He's just as slimy as a slug. Only a bratty midget who gets all violent while intoxicated. Nakahara Chuya is an idiot! Ouch! Get a hold of yourself! Hey! I hereby announce our Japanese-styled schedule for today. First of all, we will go take a bath. Our early dinner will be tonkatsu at Ikenohata. (tonkatsu = breaded, deep-fried pork cutlet) After wandering around Ginza, we will be sallying forth into a caf√© for the night. Huh? Where do we get the money? How is it? Tonight, after you're done here, won't you go out with me? I'm sorry. My mother's last words before she passed away, was that I mustn't go out with people I meet for the first time. Your mother's last testament? Oh? When looked closely, you're just the splitting image of Dietrich Marlene. Many people have said that too. Maybe I do look like her. It's the truth. Speaking truthfully from an unsophisticated heart is the true style of a gentleman. You're a nice person, aren't you? Who is the person cleaning tables? Tsuneko-san, right? Yes. Thank you. Help me up! Help me up! Ouch! Yozo! Come on! Get up. It's starting soon. Right now, they are at the starting line. They dived in. They dived in. They all dived in at once. This is between our own Maehata and Geneger... ...even though it's relatively close, our girl Maehata is still taking the lead... Don't break it. A little more! Our Maehata has turned. Our Maehata has turned. Followed by Geneger... Really! What do you think is this "zaaa" sound? It's not just a mere jarring sound. These radio electromagnetic waves travel through the sea before reaching here. This is the sound of those waves. At any rate, the whole world is similarly disrupted... Be quiet! Hang in there! Geneger has dashed out too. Geneger has dashed out too. Sill taking the lead by a little. Maehata's still taking the lead. Hang in there! Hang in there... Hang in there! Hang in there... Maehata, hang in there. Maehata, hang in there. Maehata, only 5 meters! Only 5 meters left! She won! She won! She won! WE WON!! Maehata has won! Maehata has won! She did it! Maehata has won! Maehata has won! Maehata has won! Maehata has won! Maehata has won! Maehata has won! Maehata has won! Maehata has won! She did it! We won!! Oba, we won! A bath after going out all night and coming back in the morning. I didn't think this was so budget. How is it? Pretty chic don't you think? I don't care if it's uncouth. I fit better into the scenes at the red light district. I heard from those girls that you're getting much better lately. No matter who, there seems to be a time when women can't help falling for a certain man. It's a filthy period of time. You're really sympathetic towards those girls, aren't you? Hiroki-san. Shall we die together? No way in hell. If you want to die, then go ahead do as you please. But first, take some woman with you to have a double suicide. If you can't, don't try to look cool. I see. Sale of house settled. No trespassing Yozo-bochama. Hirame. Master has already retired. Retired? Yes. According to Master's order, Hirame has disposed this mansion already. Then, what about me? Please rest assured. I have prepared a lodging place for you at Hongo. You okay? I'll take this! Give it back. I'll take this! Give it back! You idiot! Onee-chan! Onii-chan doesn't return me the ball. What now? Where's your brother? Over there! Shoot! Please let me help you with that. Oh thank you. I'm Reiko of this Hongo inn. Please be kind to me. I'm Horiki Masao. Please be kind to me. Okay, let's unpack. What are you gonna do? Even if you ask me, as if I know... No money. Nothing can be used for pawning, either. You must be tired. Um.. If it's alright with you, please let me celebrate your moving to this new place. That's really nice of you. I'm happy. I'm jealous of you. To be able to live under one roof with Reiko-san like this. For holding this party to celebrate his moving house, thank you, Reiko-san. Please take care of me, Horiki, together with Oba. I should be the one to say that. Well then... to celebrate our shared journey ahead.. Cheers! Cheers! I'm sorry. My brother and sister are too loud downstairs, so I can't take it slowly to write this letter. People say that there are men who heat their bath water by burning the love letters they get from women. Huh? How egregious. You're talking about yourself? I have used mine to boil some milk and drink it. It must have been really sweet right? That letter... won't you let me read it? No way. I won't let you. I'm sorry to bother you, but... would you mind going down to the drugstore after the train station and buying me some sedative tablets? I'm overly exhausted. My face is burning so I can't sleep. I'm sorry. About the money... That's all right. Don't worry about the money. I only have 10 yen. Only that much... Yes. Do you like this? You only drink sake? I will drink too. Welcome! What shall I make for you? Tamagoyaki. Yes. You want it molded? Yes. Just one, please. Uncle~ You know, I used to have a husband. We came to Tokyo together. What is your husband doing now? Suddenly he left me, and I have not heard from him ever since. Perhaps it's been three years already. And then... recently he has appeared in my dream for two consecutive nights. Our ties must surely have been broken. I have a feeling that he's already dead. You know this saying "When poverty comes in the door, love flies out the window," people usually understand it backwards. It doesn't mean that when a man runs out of money, he's shaken off by women. When he runs out of money, he is down in the dumps and becomes oddly soured. Finally, he gets all worn out. The man is the one who shakes off the woman. The proverb means that when a man becomes deranged, he will shake and shake until he's free of a woman. Okay! Ritsuko-san? Hmm? It's rare for the Hoshiki chap to drink out of his own pocket. He said he couldn't reach Yo-chan. Oba Yozo huh? Yeah. Nakahara said that boy is quite promising. Eh? It's rare for Nakahara to praise someone, isn't it? Speaking of the devil. Horiki-san is waiting for you. Where did you go? You happy-go-lucky brat! I tried to go play around by myself but didn't feel satisfied at all. Okay! To an artist, messing around is an important thing. Pivotal, if you will. I want to mess around some more with my life at stake. That's the way to go! It's no fun to fool around without putting your life at stake. Tonight, we will be drinking all the way till morning! Alright! Let's drink! Shall we go to the land of dreams? You mean a caf√©? That's right, please accompany me. It's been a long time since I last came to one. Is it okay to kiss the hostesses? Okay, I must kiss some of them. I'm going to kiss whichever hostess sitting next to me. Let's raise our glasses. Oh, what a dreamy guy! However, we are not going to just simply gulp down this drink. Marx used to say "Inspection of the consumer base must be carried out at the same time as research done into the process of manufacture." Yo, Marx boy! Here they come! Here they come! Here they come! Girls are coming! Welcome to our shop! Welcome to our shop! Alright! Is anything the matter? Nah. I'll quit. Someone like me to play with this penniless woman... Good evening. Good evening. Pour me some wine. I have no money. "When poverty comes in at the door, love flies out the window." I thought you were joking but actually you were being truthful. What a complicated business that is. Wouldn't it be alright to spend my earnings? No, it wouldn't. Shall we drink some milk? You pay for it. Oh, that's all you have? Dreary, isn't it? Let's go to Kamakura to see the ocean. Is it okay? You'd better go back.. to Tokyo. If you stay with someone like me... It's alright. This is good enough. But... you're starved, aren't you? Eh? Anything is fine, just one is enough. Since the day I was born, it's been the happiest day of my life. This obi... I had borrowed it from a friend at the caf√©. Thank you. It's really alright, isn't it? You will be disinherited. Well, as time passes he will settle down... The problem is the person who committed suicide with you. Regarding this, we will leave it to the attorney to enter a nolle prosequi. We have also sent the family of the deceased girl an amount of solatium so as to avoid future trouble. Shibuta-san. What are your plans? What do you intend to do from now on? I'd better start working, wouldn't I? How do you truly feel inside? As I said, I want to go to school. That requires money. However, the problem is not about money. What is important is how you truly feel. How about that? Have you anything which might be described as aspirations for the future? So in the end.. I suppose the one who is taken care of probably doesn't understand how difficult it is to look after another person by one's self. I'm sorry. I have my utmost concern for you. This is not just because I was once responsible for looking after you. I don't like you to have such half-hearted feelings. I wish you would show me your resolution to turn over a new leaf. In the end, what do you... What do you intend to do from now on? If you won't let me stay here on the second floor, I'll work... Are you being serious? Nowadays, even graduates of Tokyo Imperial University... No, I wasn't thinking of getting a job at a company. What then? I want to become a painter. What? Here you go. "Poems of the Goat. Nakahara Chuya" "Mischievous Pierrot, naughty Pierrot" "The newborn walnut has split open from its shell" "Will it be your verse, or mine?" Nakahara-san. You are disappointed because you have met the author in real life? That is not true. The author is even a bigger nuisance than the work itself. No. For Nakahara-san... It's especially true. It's enough for me to be a buffoon alone. Nevertheless, if you enjoy being one, then that's a different matter. Now let's see... I'm going home now. You were also driven by your own circumstances. Won't you accompany me to Kamakura? Kamakura... is it? Sorry about this, but I'm asking you on purpose. I won't remind you of those unpleasant memories. I understood. I will go with you. I want to live, even if it's just for a little longer. There are still so many things in my head... that I want to put onto paper. However... my presence here right now is an outrageous mistake. Depending on the circumstances... perhaps my presence here... is not an existence any longer. Enough already. Let's go back. You have clairvoyance right, Nakahara-san? Ah...! "Bouyou bouyou." What is "bouyou"? Vast future prospects. "Ah bouyou bouyou.." Isn't this tattered uncle such a poor thing? He's going to sleep in tears again? Shut up! My house even has a trailer alright, you punks! Come here! Excuse me. May I ask whether Horiki-san is at home? Yeah. If you're asking for Masao, he's upstairs. I was completely shocked because of you. Has your father forgiven you? Regarding that... it will work out somehow. Hey. I'm warning you. Even an idiot knows he should stop here. The society won't forgive you. Even I can't take you under my wing forever. Today I have an important business to do. Business? What is it? Hey! Don't pull out the feathers from my cushion. Ah. This is... If it's alright, ask your friend to have this. This is red bean soup? Isn't it grand? You needn't bother yourself about these things. Nevertheless, it does look yummy. For cooking us your great red bean soup, thank you very much. Please go ahead. It is our treat. Oba, you have some too. My mother has specially made it for us. This is sure delicious~ After you finish eating, will you leave this place? I'll be meeting an important guest. Sorry for my impertinence. Sorry for my intrusion. Oh! Takeda-san. Thank you for coming all the way here. I have been waiting for you. Oh, this guy came out of the blue just now. But please don't mind. He's just about to go back. Then, please take a seat. How are those illustrations I asked you to draw? Yes. They are all done. I've done especially for you. Here they are. There is a... What is it Dad? I told you not to enter this room, right? Your telegram. Huh? How should I deal with this? This is from Shibuta-san. At any rate, can you just go home now? I can send you home, but... I am not that free. Despite having left your family, you're still putting up that carefree face. Where is your house? It's in Okubo. If that's where it is, it's quite near my workplace. I really want to have money. About how much? A lot. What they say is true. "Love flies out the window when poverty comes in the door." You can only cut off that bond when you die. I've been bereaved of my husband for 5 years. Perhaps I'm that person they usually call a working mother. I want to use the money I myself earn to buy alcohol, um no, to buy as much as cigarettes. I'm much better at drawing than Horiki. Are you really? You're adorable when you joke that way with a serious face. Cartoons, I mean. I' sure I'm better than Horiki at cartoons if nothing else. That's right. I have in fact gotten quite interested too. Those cartoons you're always drawing for Shigeko are pretty interesting. How would you like to try it out? I can help you ask my editor-in-chief. "As promised," "the raccoon carried the firewood on its back and went down the mountain." "The rabbit followed behind, secretly kindled the firewood," "knocking the firestones against each other." "Hey dear rabbit, what are those clacking noises?" "That is the singing voice of clacking birds in this clacking mountain." "I see, I see." "While it says that, the firewood has started to burn." "Hey dear rabbit, what are those crackling noises?" "That is the singing voice of crackling birds in this crackling mountain." "I see, I see." Hey Daddy, they say as long as we pray for something, God will give us that. Is it true? Yeah. That's true. Even though God may give Shige-chan anything, perhaps it's impossible for Daddy. Why is it impossible? Because I have disobeyed my father's words. Really? But everyone says that Daddy is a good person. I see, I see. Shige-chan, what do you want to ask God for? You know for Shigeko, I just want my real dad. Oh there he is, there he is. Welcome! Isn't your manga gaining a lot of popularity? Without knowing how scarily good an amateur is, I couldn't rival you. However, once you get unprepared, you will fall from heaven to hell. Because at any rate, your rough sketches are still quite clumsy. Can we not talk about that? It's as if you're throwing rage at me. If you only have talent to earn a living, you will get worn out sooner or later. Horiki-san, you are talking about yourself? Your womanizing comes in quite handy at times like this, doesn't it? I don't want to to be told that by Horiki-san. By the way, won't you lend me 5 yen? It really can't be helped. That's right, Ibuse-san and Dan-san are going to extend their stay at Misaka mountain. If you two can be there with them, they're gonna be delighted. They are paying a visit to soldiers there? That's right. Anyhow, Nakahara would be there right? Didn't you know? Nakahara-san has passed away. Since last year's autumn. That Nakahara fellow, in Hell... "Look, look." "This is my bone." (note: Nakahara Chuya has a poem titled "A bone") He surely gets on those demons' nerves. To the deceased Nakahara-san, no matter what Horiki-san says, he can't resist anymore. It's disgusting. Nakahara-san. Sake is a comedy. Whisky is a tragedy. Will Daddy be coming home today? It's nice if he is coming home, right? He will definitely if he doesn't drink too much. Why do adults drink sake? You know, it's not that Daddy drinks sake because he likes it. He is a good person. So good people drink sake? That's not it either. Perhaps, it's not Daddy who drinks sake, but it is sake that drinks up Daddy. I have split up with her. I see. Yo-chan is upstairs? I wonder if he could drink with me. Yo-chan! Fujida-san asks for you. Yes. Here you go. Futabayama won't lose. He will lose some day. Everyone will. Losing, you say? Futabayama is like the Imperial Army, "hundred battles hundred victories." Hm! Hey hey, this is our Yokozuna, (note: yokozuna = a sumo grand champion) Minanogawa-zeki. (note: zeki is a term used out of respect to refer to wrestlers in the upper echelons of sumo) That's right! Yokozuna, please go ahead. I am human too! ‚ô´ Hey, the pretty girl sitting at that cigarettes shop ‚ô´ in that small alley... Please sell me! Give me two Camels please! This is not good. You're getting drunk every day. Why is it not good? Why is it bad? "Oh, plagued no more with Human or Divine, Tomorrow's tangle to itself resign," "And lose your fingers in the tresses of The Cypress-slender Minister of Wine." Do you understand? No, I don't. Don't make fun of adult men. I'm going to kiss you. Do it. Yoshiko-chan, your sense of virtue is... I'm begging you. Please don't drink anymore. I will stop. From this very minute, I won't drink even one drop. Really? I'm happy! "Smoking for our country's national defense and social structure" Oba Yozo has just come back. What's the matter? I've gotten a scratch while on mission. Good work! Thank you for waiting, Kikuchi-sensei. Thank you. Never mind, never mind. Don't you drink something too? I will have some Absinthe then. Get one here. Hey.. I will be coming again. I'm sorry. I swear. I will not drink the next time. Will you forgive me? That's no use. You're pretending to be drunk. Forgive me. I won't drink again. Because you've sworn to me. There's no way you would have drunk again. Don't act in front of me any more. He's broken free! He's broken free! He's broken free! Now turning to the left. Minanogawa pushed! He pushed his opponent all in one breath! But there comes! Futaba counter-attacked! Futaba has shown us he still has the upper hand! Futaba is pushing! He's pushing! He's still pushing! Futaba is pushing! He's pushing! Minanogawa is still standing firm! Futaba! Futaba! Futaba! Futaba's pushing! Futaba's pushing! Beltless arm throw! Beltless arm throw! Beltless arm throw! Victory belongs to Futabayama... There. Thank you. "Onslaught after onslaught," "like a hurricane sweeping all dry leaves, we successfully conquered Mongolia." "Once again, after a long march, we have advanced to Yingshan." "Each army group led by Morozumi, Tashiro, Kurabayashi, Soeda..." "have been operating according to Iwanaka Corps' plan to attack the connecting railroads and cables." "Our spirit is on the rise." "Just like raging billows, we are aiming to close in on Joshu..." Thanks. Hey lady killer. Somehow, you are already putting on that prudent-looking face. I came to pass you a message from Miss Takeda. Is it alright? Don't mind her. You can say anything. Still conceited as usual. Why, it's nothing important though. She asked me to tell you that both she and Shige-chan are doing well. You can come visit them once in a while. Oh, this is from her. To congratulate you. This might seem abrupt, but... Shall we drink? Sure! Are vice and crime different? They are, I think. Virtue and vice are concepts invented by human beings, words for a morality which human beings arbitrarily devised. What a nuisance. Well, I suppose it is God in that case. God, God, God, God. You can't go wrong if you leave everything to God. By the way, I'm starved. Yoshiko is cooking some beans downstairs now. Oh thanks. My favorite. You don't seem to be very interested in crime, do you? That's right, I don't. I'm not a criminal like you. I may indulge myself with a little dissipation, but I don't cause women to die, and I don't live off their money either. Anyhow, I'm really famished. Can you bring something up here to eat already? Why don't you go get it yourself? Okay! Very well then. I will go downstairs, Yoshiko-chan and I will commit a crime together. Do as you please. Go somewhere already! It's gonna be over soon. Hey! What sora beans.. Come! Thank you for the treat. I can sympathize with you. However, doesn't this teach you some lesson too? I'm not coming to this house ever again. It'll soon be a complete hell. But at least forgive Yoshiko-chan. You are no decent fellow yourself. I'm bidding you farewell here. Sit down. Let's eat sora beans together. I'm done eating. Yoshiko-chan? Yes. Is there still sake left? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sugar... sugar... (Sleeping tablets) Yoshiko.. How many times does he want to do it before he stops? Just about when I'm so busy with thousands of things in the word, On a day he chooses to do something like this, even I can't withstand it myself. Perhaps he detests me so much. Madam. What? You're awake already? Please let me split with Yoshiko. I'm going to a place where there is no woman. Yes! That would be great. You ought to go to a place without any woman. As long as you're with a woman, you're just useless. It's great that you're going someplace with no woman. Ouch. Ouch. Ouch. Sorry. Won't you save me? My body feels sluggish. I can't get to sleep even though I'm completely exhausted. It's really painful. Sake... You'll have to give up drinking. I may have alcohol poisoning. But I still want to drink. You mustn't. My husband used to claim that he would kill the germs with liquor. He ended up soaking himself in alcohol. That's how he shortened his own life. I feel so on edge I can‚Äôt stand it. I‚Äôm afraid. I‚Äôm no good for anything. I‚Äôll give you some medicine. But please cut out the drinking at least. This is medicine to build your blood. This is a serum for vitamin injections. Here is the hypodermic needle. These are calcium pills. This is diastase to keep you from getting an upset stomach. And also, this is... This is a medicine to be used only when you need a drink so badly you can‚Äôt stand it. It is a very strong medicine, but it is not as harmful as alcohols. "This is the only favor I will ask you in this lifetime." "Older Brother, please lend me..." Please, please give me more of that medicine. I can't. It's a strong medicine. You will be poisoned. I beg of you! Just one more box. I'll figure out a way tol pay you at the end of the month. You can settle the bill any time you want. I wouldn't mind. But the police are very troublesome. I'll be in deep waters. Please do something about that. I beg you! Madam, I will give you a kiss. I can't do any work unless I have the medicine. It's a kind of energy-builder for me. How about hormone injections? Don't be silly. It's either alcohols or that medicine, one or the other. If I haven't got either of them, I can't work. You mustn't drink. Isn't that right? Ever since I began with that medicine, I haven't touched a single drop of alcohol. Thanks to you, I'm in fine physical shape. You know, I don't intend to go on drawing stupid cartoons forever. Now that I've stopped drinking and have straightened myself out, I'm going to study. I will definitely become a great painter. I'll show you. Now I'm at a critical phase. Therefore, will you? Please. I am going to give you a kiss. This is the charity pot of the Salvation Army. Please give us your cooperation. This is the charity pot of the Salvation Army. Please give us your cooperation. This is the charity pot of the Salvation Army. Please kindly give us your cooperation. This is the charity pot. "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." This is the charity pot of the Salvation Army. Please give us your cooperation. Why is it be this pot? What? Why must there be a pot here? What? When you put your money into the pot like that, don't you feel filthy at all? Jesus Christ! Please come here. He's a demon. Go away! Amen. This is the charity pot of the Salvation Army. Please give us your cooperation. I heard you have lung hemorrhage. Just leave the rest here in our care. Please get hospitalized at once. This is our farewell. Here is a token of my farewell gift. I don't need it. I thought it would be a tasteful present. Too bad. By the way, won't you lend me 5 yen? No way. No way in hell. I got it. Who do you think you are, you half-dead drug addict! This is the end of you. From the first day I saw you, your face too, your voice too... I have hated everything about Oba Yozo. But now, I even loathe you more than ever before. Well, you can take your time convalescing here. The Master has passed away. My condolences. Next up, please allow me to convey to you the intention of your brother who has become the heir to all property. "To Yozo." "I won't ask you about your past." "Nor do you have to worry about your lifestyle." "You don't have to do anything." "In exchange for that, you must leave Tokyo at once." "Start a new life and recuperate in the countryside." "You shall be following Shibuta's..." He means me, Hirame. "You shall be following Shibuta's instruction under all circumstances." "Oba Shinzo." Hirame I have covered up all of your misconduct. Please devote yourself wholeheartedly to your recuperation in Tsugaru. At a hot spring location on the seashore, I have prepared a relatively nice house for you. The deceased Master personally knows her. She will be taking care of you from now on. Tetsu-sama. Please be kind to me. This album is... a memento of the deceased Master. I was asked to hand this to you. These letters were returned. Thank you. Tetsu-sama. You can eat together with me. Yozo-sama, who didn't enjoy much motherly love and I, who doesn't hold the fate to have a child. The two of us... are destined to be mother and son. Am I alive? Or am I dead? Will someone like me... be forgiven? You will. You will. I will make apologies to God. No matter what happens, I will always protect you, Yozo-sama. I am... not even a human any longer. It's cold. It's so cold. ‚ô´ Morning has come to the upper part of the Earth. ‚ô´ But the other part is still engulfed in the night. ‚ô´ On our country's west side is Europe. ‚ô´ On our country's east side is Orient. ‚ô´ In the middle of Fuji mountain and Tsukuba, there flows Sumida River. Excuse me! Is Oba Yozo-san at home? Huh? Aren't you the young master of the Ichino family? That's right, and you are...? Right? Just as I thought. You might have forgotten already. It's been about 20 years now. I used to drive a carriage at Kanagi. As you have already known, I now have fallen low. I can't do nothing but draw. There is no such thing. As long as you can still draw, you will have a bright future. Police officer, what for did you come here? If you have any business, then tell me. Yozo-sama hasn't done anything wrong. "On a mountain," "there is a chestnut tree." "Only a single tree." "On top of it," "a crow comes flying," "and stops there." "The crow..." "sings out raucously," "Then a nut from the tree..." "a single one..." "suddenly drops off." "Again..." "a crow comes flying," "sings out raucously," "Then a nut from the tree..." "suddenly drops off." "Again..." "a crow..." "sings out raucously," "Then a nut from the tree..." "suddenly drops off." From the great alliance, there will be Fengtian, Hsinking, Harbin, Qiqihar. Then there is also Halhyn-gol. China, Manchuria, Mongolia, Korea, Japan. The harmony between these 5 countries is like a castle built on sand. The dream of a virtuous king ruling over all is only a pipe dream. ‚ô´ Waves are soaring at Bekira's abyss. ‚ô´ Clouds are flying about wildly over a mountain top. I don't get it! Those people think of nothing except for the vastness of China they can see on a map! They have no idea how dreadful those four, no, five hundred million people can be. That's right. They don't know about China's potentiality. No, most importantly, this is not the time for Japan to start a conflict with China. They don't even realize this most important thing. Still, we cannot stop the Sino-Japanese war. If not, Japan will perish! I am sorry for having been born. "Bouyou bouyou." Nakahara-san. What is "bouyou"? Vast future prospects. "Bouyou bouyou." "Bouyou bouyou." On purpose, on purpose. Maehata, only 5 meters! Only 5 meters left! Anything is fine, just one is enough. "I see, I see." Minanogawa! Minanogawa! Minanogawa! Don't act in front of me any more. It is not as harmful as alcohols. Yozo-sama hasn't done anything wrong. By the way, won't you lend me 5 yen? "Bouyou bouyou." We will be announcing special news. We will be announcing special news. At the headquarters of the Imperial Navy Army, at 6 p.m on December 8, it has been announced that at early dawn this morning, The Imperial Navy Army at West Pacific has officially entered into an armed conflict with armies of the USA and Britain. At early dawn this morning, The Imperial Navy Army at West Pacific has officially entered into an armed conflict with armies of the USA and Britain. For the person that I am right now, there is neither happiness nor unhappiness. Everything is merely passing me by.
