Arnold house. David? Oh, hey Ava. What are you up to? Just looking at... Um, I'm just looking at my card collection. Cool. Do you want to come over and we can look at them together? Um... I don't... I don't think that'd be such a good idea right now. I mean, I'd like to, but I just can't right now. Are you not allowed to stay out late again? Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's it. Well, I bet I can ask my mom if you could stay over. - Mom. - Uh, no. No, it's okay. I'm pretty tired anyways. Okay. Um... what about tomorrow? Maybe... noon? I'll be there. Great. Good night, David. Good night, Ava. Shh. ...please, please, please! David, where is your brother? You got what's coming to him next if you don't fucking tell me where he is now! - Do not yell at him. - Shut up, Dianne! What are you doing? - Where is he? - He's not in here. - Where is he? - You're drunk and you need to calm down. He's not in here! Matthew? No, no, no, no, no. Come on! Get out from under there! Please, you're going to hurt him, Matthew. Matthew, please. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, please, stop! The boy needs to learn to respect his parents, huh? Going around school telling parents and friends that I'm a bad father, huh? What kind of son does that, huh? - You're hurting him. - Is that what family does? I can't hear you, boy. Do you respect me now? Oh, my God. No, no, no! Matthew, careful! Please don't hurt him! I'll teach you. Or you a big boy now? Oh, a big tough man are ya? Huh? Oh, David. Oh, David, no. That is it! Matthew! No! We are done! We are through! I want you out! Is that what you want? Good. 'Cause I don't care about any of you! In fact, I hate all of you! Is this what you want? Is that what you want there? Here. Take it. Take it. Oh my God, baby boy. I'm so sorry. Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. Oh you mother fucker! I will kill you! Get out of my house! So let me get this straight. You're saying that in a seven-game series, you wouldn't use the same pitcher twice if he didn't pitch well the first time? What? Doesn't who's pitching matter to you? - Or is your answer the same? - No, it doesn't matter. So, what, if Nichols ends up losing this game for us... - Which he will. - He shouldn't pitch the rest of the series? No, he had his chance, he blew it. Move onto the next guy, it's that simple. David, it's game one of the series. The Majors run a five-man rotation, and Nichols is arguably our best pitcher. I don't know what you want me to say, Jack. Hey guys. - Ava. - What's up? - Question. - Fire away. If your best pitcher is pitching game one of a series and he doesn't do well in his first game, do you use him again in the series? Is he drunk? Are you even old enough to be in here? Shh, I need you to take this seriously. To put it simply... do you believe in second chances? If it's deserved, then yeah, why not? I think most people deserve a second chance in life. Finally, someone agrees with me. 'Cause David over here doesn't think so. Oh, tough guy, eh? All right, I'm going to take a leak. You two... reconnect. How are you? - Good. How are you? - I'm good. How's your mom? Well, she's seen better days. She's all right. We had dinner before heading there. - No way, Dylan's there. - Really? Yeah, he's at the game. Did you guys see him? No, we must have missed him. Anyway, uh, how is he? Dylan? He's good. He starts kindergarten soon. Here. Hoo. Yeah, he's really excited for baseball to start up. Like, it's all he's talking about. Yeah, sure. He gonna be good? Well, maybe not as good as you, but, yeah, I think he'll be good. He could learn a thing or two about batting if I'm being completely honest. It... Oh, no. What happened? Fucking... Coach Daniels just texted me. Oh? I got cut. - I'm sorry, Jack. - Baseball? Oh, that sucks. Whatever. Can we go? Sure. Well, I guess... I guess we're leaving. What? Here. Really? Oh, shit. You know what? Screw Coach Daniels anyways. If he doesn't want me, then I don't want to be on the team. Most Juniors don't make it to varsity anyway. - You did. - I worked for it. And what, I didn't? Jack, you spend all your time inside playing video games. - What do you expect? - I put in the work. You just never see me. I don't see you 'cause you don't practice. - Yes, I do. - When? I worked my ass off for that spot on the team! Oh, and what do you want me to do? Text Coach. And say what? I'm your younger brother. I come from the same genes as you! Tell him to give me a spot on the team. I'm not going to do that, Jack. Why not? I'm telling you, I'm as good as any player on that team. Coach just has it out for me. If you set him straight, I'll be running laps around those losers by the end of the season. - Watch the road. - The one time I ask you for a favor, you let me down? You don't think I'm good enough, do you? - Jackson, the road! - What's a big brother for then? Aren't you supposed to watch out for me? Pull over! In control of everything! He hit the pole. Are they okay? Everything all right? We gotta go! We gotta go, man. Nobody saw anything. We could just go. The cops will be here fast. They'll be okay. We gotta go! There's a kid? It's Dylan. What? It's Ava's kid. And that's his dad, dead in the driver's seat. What... I can't... The cops will come with an ambulance. They'll be fine. We're faster, we're closer to the hospital. We can get there faster than they can get here. - David... - Jackson! Hey, welcome home, baby. All right. Don't! Sit. I got it. - Thanks. - You're welcome. I see you kept the car. Yeah, yeah, what was I gonna do, sell it? Jack couldn't make it? Oh, I don't know what your brother's doing. What do you mean? Well, he hasn't been around to see me in months. Actually it's... probably been about a year now. Now that I start thinking about it. Well, I'll go see him. Who is it? It's me, Jackson. What do you want? I'm back. Do you want to get lunch? Nah. Can't. Why? I'm busy. Jackson, open the door. I'm not talking to you like this. You see me now. What do you want? Hey. I'm heading for lunch. Do you want to come? No. Why not? Busy. I saw the Chevelle's at home and... surprised you didn't take it. You think Mom would ever give it to me? Yeah. She says you hadn't been around in a while. Why would I be? Is something wrong? You tell me. You okay? I... I got an interview today. Where? Well, I texted Coach. I asked if I could get a job doing something at the field, you know? Maybe coaching. Hopefully coaching. That's great, honey. Son, how have you been? Good. How's the mom? She's all right. Thanks for asking. So... what can I do for you? Well, Coach, I need a... I... I... I want a job. You know, I'm thinking I could make a great coach. David, it's mid-season. We ain't got any jobs. And even if I did... would that really be the best thing? Well, I've always been one of your best players, you know, and I think I could make an excellent addition to the coaching staff. You know, I know a lot of players go - from player to coach... - David. David. I'm not denying your talent. Trust me. I just... I just can't do it right now, son. The moms in these leagues would kill me. Maybe next season, maybe some father will drop out of coaching a Little League team. And by that time, the storm will blow over, and it'll be an afterthought in your life. Yeah. Here. How's this. You know what? You know what I got? I got this umpire gig for a Little League division. The guy doing the job doesn't show up on time. Hell. You'd be wearing a mask. It'd be a solution for everyone. How does that sound? So... how did it go? I got it. Oh, honey, I'm so proud of you! What team? What? What team are you coaching? Oh, it's a Little League team. Good for you, David. Yeah. Look, I'm going for a walk. Do you want to come? I just saw Jackson. And? Oh, honey, he's... he's just... He hasn't recovered from the accident... mentally. Mentally. I don't think he ever will, to be honest. Most people handle things differently. He was always the emotional one, David. He will always have a bigger and longer reaction to things. He's so grateful for what you did for him. But he's just... he suffered in a much different way than you did. One sec. David. What the hell was that? - Was that who I think it was? - Yes, it was. Are you crazy? What are you doing? We remained close over the years, David. We were family friends before it happened, you know that. So, what, you're... You're best friends now? She's lonely, David. I help her when she needs help. You help her? She's renovating the house. I help her paint. Mom, do you know what I did to them? No. She knows what Jackson did to them. - David, she needed to know. - We talked about this. That isn't your place to do that. No, that's your place to do that. No, that isn't anyone's place! She's such a good woman, David. And Dylan, Dylan is such a good kid. He reminds me so much of you. And I just think... I don't care! I can't care! It's just... Why are you doing this to me? It's like a constant reminder... You won't have to deal with it for much longer! I am going... I have something I need to go and do. And I'd appreciate it very much if when I see you tomorrow morning... you don't have the same attitude. It was a kid? It's Dylan. It's Ava's kid. Morning. Knocked over the clock. Sorry if I woke you. I'm also... sorry I overreacted yesterday. I didn't... I didn't mean to yell at you. I just... I found this photo of us. Jackson, you, and me. I'd never seen it before. I didn't even know it existed. It's... look at... look at that. Are we waiting on anyone? No. Let's get started then, shall we? Okay. This seems pretty straightforward. "All my belongings I leave to David Arnold, my eldest son." Wait, hold on. Seems we have one more. She made a final update to her will a few days ago. "There's a present in my bedroom closet which will be left to Ava Williams's son, Dylan Williams. It is to be given to Dylan by my son David." David. I didn't know you were home. I am. I'm sorry about your mom. So? Um, mom left Dylan a present before she, uh... What is it? I don't know. I didn't open it. Dylan. Come here. This is a gift from Auntie Dianne. This is Auntie Dianne's son, David. We used to be friends when we were your age. Hello, Mister. All right. Thank you. Look, Mom! Oh! Wow. That's my glove. Sorry? It... it was my glove when I was Dylan's age. - Oh. - No, no. Keep it. I didn't... I didn't know she held onto it. It's good, it'll go to good use. Okay, sweetheart, what do you say? Thank you, Mister. Dylan left his last glove out in the rain, so I guess this saves us from getting a new one, huh? You play baseball? Yup and I'm going to be the best player ever. Okay, go grab your ball. We'll play catch after lunch. All right. Thank you, David. Here. You teach it now? Yeah. I teach a night class to people who want to learn how to paint. It's mostly old people, but, you know, I enjoy it. I teach with Jessica from high school. - Remember her? - Yeah. So, yeah, I don't know why I gave you that, but my number is on the front. If you ever find anything of ours at your mother's place. You were over? Yeah. Often, actually. I'll see you at the funeral. You're coming? If that's okay. See ya there. You've reached Jackson. I'll get back to you when I do. Hey, Jackson, it's me. Um... funeral's tomorrow. Wondering if maybe you could drive me, since I can't? I don't know, maybe you could, um, take a bus over and you could drive Dad's car if you wanted to? Um... anyway, uh, let me know. - David. - No. - David, wait. - Walk away. David, why won't you talk to me, please? I've got nothing to say to you! I can't imagine you have anything - to say... - David. Hi Ava. Nice to see you. Hey, Matthew. David. David. I'm sober. Go, please. You okay? I'm fine. Pull over. What? Please. Fuck. Where are you going? Thanks for the ride, Ava. I don't need it. It's okay, David. I know what you're going through. You have no clue. You don't think I know, huh? You don't think I've been in this exact same spot? I know exactly what you're going through. And if you give it any leeway, David, it'll kill you. It'll fucking kill you! Look. I forgot about that. I found it while I was going through some of my old stuff. That's crazy to think we went to prom together. Or the first part of prom, anyway. It must have been 12 months later I had Dylan. I'll always remember prom was on the same day as Dylan's birthday. Does he know? No. He doesn't. He remembers something happened, but... he doesn't know what. And I'd like to keep it that way. He doesn't remember anything about his father. And I know he's curious. But he's just not ready yet. I remember when I first went in. My mom would visit every Monday. She'd visit me every Monday for the first four years I was there, and she'd come with that week's update on the Majors. I swear, she went to every game. She knew all the players, how they played, even all their places in the standings. She was a great woman. Yeah, but that's the thing. She didn't like baseball. - I thought she did. - No. Well, my dad liked baseball. She didn't... she didn't really care much for it. Of course she came to my games when I was a kid. Jackson and my dad did too, but... She'd never go to a game that didn't involve us. She said it was too boring. Jackson and I went to every Majors game we could. We were their biggest fans. Absolute die hards. And since I couldn't go anymore... she'd go for me. She'd take multiple nights off each week just to go to baseball games that she didn't give a shit about. Just as an excuse to be able to talk to me about something on Monday. Ended up watching the games anyway. I think she didn't think we had TV in there, but I never told her. I just kind of liked hearing her explain it, you know? She'd come every Monday and give me the rundown on what happened in each game and... that's my mom. You holding up? Oh yeah, man. Holding up so good. You want to talk about it? Older bro checking up on his younger, troubled brother. - So touching. - Yeah, where have you been? I've been busy getting none of Mom's inheritance. Who told you that? No one. That's how I knew. No call, no inheritance. I saw you with Dad at the funeral. He's been helping me out lately. Sure. I don't know, he's just... He's been helping me back on my feet, you know? You forgive him? It's not like that. He's been good for like five years now or something. I don't know, that AA shit... it works. Hmm. Is this part of your program? I'm not in any program. I don't need no program. You sure? I can quit when I want to. I just don't want to. You may be too young to remember this, Jackson. But the things that happened in our household... things he did to you, to us... were unforgivable. I don't care if he's your own blood, your own family. A real father doesn't beat their kids with the fist that wears their wedding ring. I've been with you my whole life and I'm still fucking here. You know where I am. Do we have any more paint out here? - Uh, this one's empty, too. - All right. Um, hmm... I can walk to the store, pick some up. It won't take me long. I just have to grab my wallet. Oh, no, that's okay. I'll just drive and get some. - Shit. - You all right? Yeah, Dylan is going to be back from school any minute. Do you mind just like, waiting on the porch? I just don't want him to be... - spooked. - Yeah, sure. I don't mean anything by it. No, I get it. Okay, I'll be 10 minutes, tops. I'll be here. Hello Mister. It's locked. It's locked. She just went to the store. She'll be back. Hey. - Hey guys. - Hey Mom. What's up? Mister and I are playing catch. I see that. - Can I help? - No, it's okay. It's okay. Dylan, did you forget your key at school again? I forgot it in my desk. Anything I should know about? No, nothing. Come on, sweetheart. It's time for lunch. I think we're good for the day. Bye, Mister. Thanks for playing catch with me. Hello? Hey. What are you up to? Um, nothing. Uh, do you need me to come... Come back over and finish painting? No, no. Dylan and I are going to East Park tomorrow. It's supposed to be a beautiful day outside, so we're going to make the best of it. And, um, Dylan was wondering if you wanted to join? You don't have to if you don't want to. But Dylan was quite looking forward to it. He says he needs someone to ride the go-karts with. He says I'm too slow. I don't know how much faster I can go. Hey, I'll be there. Come on. You're telling me that you never cheated on his test? No. But you were so busy with baseball. Yeah, and? Well, my mom would know if I cheated. Like, if I came home with a 90 on a test that she never saw me study for, she'd know something was up. Whatever happened with that? - What? - Baseball. Why did you stop? You want to know the true story or the one I usually tell people? Both. Well, when people ask me this question, I usually have this answer built up in my mind. I usually tell them it's 'cause... my dad left when I was a kid and I had to help my mom pay the bills. But... that's not true 'cause my dad left and I was 14. I didn't quit baseball until after high school. Then why? After he left and stopped coming to my games, I just... guess I just stopped caring, you know? It's tough though, 'cause like, I put so much time into this one thing for so long and... it's just hard to know when to... let it go. Why do you teach painting? Not paint paint? Have you ever seen my stuff? No. This is why I don't paint paint. It's amazing. It's... it kind of reminds me of um... When I was a kid, my dad used to take us to the beach all the time. We'd only go on windy days because of the waves. We'd race into the water and see who could crash into the biggest wave. It's kind of... one of the few good memories I have of him. Do you have any more? Yeah. Ooh. Where's that? Nowhere. I created it. What? You don't have to say anything. If you don't like it, you can be honest with me. It's beautiful. What's it doing in a box? What do you mean? What are you doing? This painting deserves more than just to rot away in a box. There. Right where it belongs. Where will I put the mirror then? What do you need a mirror for? Hello? Yo, what are you doing? I'm... I'm just at Labatt Park right now. The Majors are playing. I'm about to head in. Oh. Can I come? Um... I'm actually... I'm with some people right now, actually. Who are you going with? You wouldn't know him. Oh, okay. Um, another time then. Yeah. Definitely. We got to catch up soon. I miss watching these games with you. Yeah, me too. Okay well, I got to go. It was good talking to you though. You too. You ready? Okay, come on. He's their best pitcher. You can't just get rid of them after one hit. Well, maybe the manager knows something we don't, right? Maybe he thinks his best pitcher is better suited for another game. So, we'll pull him out early to save his arm. It's game one of the series. You gotta set the stage, and you do that with your best pitcher. How do you know all this? Know what? All this stuff about baseball. Aren't you like, eight? Every night if I watch the 6 p.m. news with my mom, she'll let me stay up and watch the late-night game on TV. And you do? Oh. You know, I used to stay up late at night and just listen on my Walkman radio under the bed. I never got to watch the games on TV. A radio? You're old, Mister. Wow. And they're pulling him? Oh, my God. How fast are you? Run! Run, Dylan, run! Woo-hoo! Woo! Go, go, go! Yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah, Dylan! Woo-hoo! Look at him go! Yeah! Hey! Look at that. You're on TV! Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo! Beautiful. Okay everyone, five more minutes and then we will show the class. So, how are things? I'm great. And Dylan? He is at a baseball game right now, so I assume he's pretty happy as well. I thought you always booked off work because of the games. No, not his. He's at a Majors game. Oh, that's cool. Who'd he go with? A friend? You could say that. Yeah, he's there with a friend of mine where he's, um, maybe a little bit more than a friend to the both of us. But yes, a friend. A friend. And does this friend happen to have a name? Yes, Jessica. He has a name. Um, it's David. From school. David. - Like, "David" David? - Yeah. Just to be clear, we're talking about the one who killed Scott? Oh, my God. Yes. Yes, Scott, my ex-boyfriend, thank you so much for reminding me. But he didn't mean to do it. I've explained this to you already. Yeah, he saved Dylan. But how did Dylan get there? Because of David. I'm obviously missing something here. You wouldn't understand. Ava, look at me. Oh my God, you're sleeping with him. No. What? Jessica, I am not sleeping with him. Keep your voice down. Like, I knew you always had a crush on him, but I didn't think you'd date him... Okay, can you just finish the class for me? I didn't mean to upset you. - I'm just looking out for you. - I know. I know. Careful. Well, what are we gonna do now? - I don't know. - I don't know either. I guess we're going to have to get ice cream. - Hey! - Jackson. Is that who I think it is? Here, just go wait up at the lights, I'll meet you up there. Answer! - Jackson, calm down. - No. What are you doing with him? Well, we just went to the game, man. I thought we were finally putting this is behind us. Now you're... You told him, didn't you? That... that I did it. That I'm the bad guy. Right? They could still press charges! What has this man told... - Get off of me! - Shut the fuck up, hey! - Get off of me! - Shut up! Dad, stop! Don't hurt him. I'm okay. So, what? You're a daddy figure now? Does he know? No. You never lose, do you? - Jackson. - Get the fuck off me. All right. Look at me. Look at me. Look at my feet. Okay? When you swing, your front foot should step forward like that, okay? And your back foot should pivot. That's right. Okay. Now, full motion should look like this. - Hey, Ave. - "Ave?" Dylan just wanted me to help him with his swing. Um... can I talk to you outside for a sec? Sure. Here. All right, line it up. Okay? I'll be right back. What's up? Um... Dylan called me "Dad" today. What? What? I... I don't know how to respond to that. What do you mean? He thinks you're his dad, David. Ever since you showed up. I don't know if it's some sense he believes he has. It's why he wants to see you all the time. He's curious. Just don't... Don't bring this up with him and hopefully he will just forget about it. I cannot deal with this right now. Well, I can. I can be there for him. For you. I... I can be that person. Good night, David. Strike three! Batter, out. Switch sides. Excuse me, are you going to keep calling the game? Are you who I think you are? - Sorry? - Are you who I think you are? - Let's go, buddy! - Go Dylan. Oh, that's okay, buddy. That's okay. Right back here. Right back. Hey. Aren't you that guy who killed that dude in a car accident? - Oh, yeah, yeah. - Oh yeah, it is you. How the hell did you get this job? Ma'am, it's a... It's a minimum wage... I don't care. You shouldn't be umping a kid's baseball game. Who hired you? Oh dude, my dad read about you in the paper a few weeks ago. You... you must have just gotten out. Dude, you're a monster. I'm going to call the commissioner. Hell, maybe even the Free Press. Ava. - Hey. - It's okay. David, I'm not mad at you. It's just the kids. I'm sorry. I just need time. I just need space. Watch the game and then we'll go. Yeah. Listen, kid. I don't want to do this. But some parents around the league noticed you and complained. I told you not to take the mask off. Listen. Umping wasn't for you anyways. Take the rest of the season off. We can talk about a coaching job later in the year. When you're out of the news more. Okay? Things like this die down quicker than you'd think. There's going to be a bigger and worse story next week. Hey. Head up. Don't let this beat you down, kid. You made a mistake. Make up for it. That's the best you can do. Coming! - What are you doing here? - Let's go. Come on. - Where? - Coming or what? Come on, I'll tell you on the way. 'Kay, just... Okay, honey, I'm going to go out with David for a little bit. I'll be back soon, okay? Can I watch the game, please? Mmm, what do I say? Only if I watch the news. Good boy. I love you. Muah! Muah. Be good. I'll have Jessica come check on you. Love you, sweetie. Barrington's two home runs last night helped rally the Majors to a 6-5, bottom of the ninth comeback win. Putting them back in first place in the division. Breaking news. Coming up tonight on our 6 p.m. special. Infamous David Arnold of London, Ontario, has resurfaced at Labatt Park after spending nearly half a decade in the Elgin-Middle sex Detention Center. I got you, I got you. David. - Keep them closed. - Are you going to rob me? 'Cause I'll kick your ass. I swear I will. Okay. Okay. - Keep them closed. - I will. Okay. You can open 'em. What are we doing here? I owe you a dance. Mm-mm. Well, I got good tunes. You're coming in, right? Yeah. Just give me a sec. Okay. Mom! Why didn't you tell me? I know who Mister really is! The lady on the news told me! You betrayed me! I hate you, I hate you, I hate you! What happened? You lied to me! - David. - Don't come near me. - I fucking mean it. - I just want to talk. I said, don't fucking touch me! All I'm asking for is a conversation. A second chance. You want a second chance, huh? Yes. Please. Okay. All right. Go home. Go home or wherever the fuck you came from. Build yourself a time machine. Are you with me so far? Go back in time, okay? Don't beat my mother. Don't beat my brother. Don't come home drunk every night. Can you do that? I know I can't change the past, David. Yeah, you're goddamn right you can't. David. David, please. David. David, if you can hear me... Jackson is in jail. He got into a fight in a bar, and he called me to bail him out. But... I think it should be you. I think you should be the one to go get him. You all right? Hey! Thanks for the bailout, bro. Wouldn't be the first time. Is that what this is about? Is this about what? It is, isn't it? You're still mad about what I did. Do you know who I did it for? - I did it for you, Jackson. - See, there. That's the problem right there. Sure, yeah, you went to prison for it. For me. Thank you, Master David. Thank you for taking the fall. I owe you my life. But fuck you! You caused that accident way more than I did. And then you take the fall and think you're baptized or something? I didn't cause the accident. You drove the car. You took me to the bar! We took your car. You chose to drink. You chose to make me drive home. I was 18. How is that fair? You're not the angel you think you are. I don't think that. I didn't say that. Well, that's what Mom thought. Don't you dare bring mom into this. You're the oldest. The athletic one. The good-looking one. The perfect son that saved us from our abusive father. Me, I'm the runt she never gave two shits about. She'd look at me and feel like a failure. - Jackson! - No, you listen. That's all she said, all the time. You're perfect and I'm not. You saved me. And I should have been the one in jail. Not you. Me. She couldn't even look me in the eye anymore. Jack... What, you want me to apologize? I killed someone! I killed someone. And I took the fall. I didn't ask for it. I didn't ask for you to take the fall. I've been suffering for five fucking years. I may not have gone to jail, but life on the outside sure as hell felt like one. David, just... just slow down, man. Just fucking slow down, okay? Look. Let's just call Mom. She'll know what to do. Let's just fucking call Mom. Okay? David! Grow up! Be a man! You got us into this mess. I'm going to get us out of it. Mom can't save you from this. Fuck. You all right, Dylan? Stay with me, bud. Stay with me. So... we've got David Arnold and Jackson Arnold, correct? You guys called someone to let them know you're down here at the precinct tonight? Our mother. Now, David, you're 23. - Jackson, you're... - 18. I just have one more thing I got to ask right now. Who drove the Chevelle tonight? I did. David Reginald Arnold, I'm placing you under arrest for vehicular manslaughter. You understand? You have the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay. Do you understand? You have the right... to contact an attorney... Mom. Mom! Mom! Mom. What? What are you up to? Dylan doing all right? Yeah, he's okay. He's at a sleep over, so... hopefully that'll cheer him up. I think you should come over and we should talk. We should talk about what happened. I'll be there. Hey. How'd you get here? Is that your car? Are you drunk? - David, are you drunk? - No. Don't lie to me. I can taste it on your breath! I'm not drunk. And you drove here? You drove here in that car? What the... What is wrong with you? You think you know me? You don't know me, Ava. I fucked up. I fucked up. I'm suffocating here! What? You don't have anything to say? Come on, say something! I ruin my mom's life. I... I ruined my brother's life. I'm ruining your life. I don't know why you tolerate me after all I've done. Because. Because I understand what you did for your brother and what you did for my son. What if it was me? What if I did it? Did you? Dad. Dad, come on. Go, go, go, go. Come on. - Okay. - I'm not going. Come on. Hey. Thanks for seeing me. - Are you hungry? It's on me. - No. Okay... Look, I'm not here to forgive you. What you did to my mother and my brother is inexcusable. I'll never forgive you for that. - I'm... I'm not here for that. - So, what do you want? You just want to talk things over now that Mom's dead? You want to be friends? It's not going to happen. It's not that easy. You think you could do that with Jackson, but he doesn't even know half of the shit that you did to him. He doesn't realize. You know that he's drinking more than he's ever drank before because of you? And he thinks that that's okay. He's an alcoholic because of you. Because you're an alcoholic. And you made him that way. No, I know! David, please. Please, just listen to me. Okay? That night. Five years ago, the night of the crash... your mother called me. And she said something to me that I will never forget. She said... "Matthew... our boys are in trouble... and I need your help." Your mother, my wife of 16 years... needed my help. Her... abusive, drunken, messed up... ex-husband's help. And I knew she really needed it, and I was wanted, David. I was wanted... for the first time in a decade. I was... I was a real mess after I left the family. But from the night of that phone call, I haven't touched a drop of alcohol. Because I made a promise to myself. And I made a promise to your mother, the love of my life... that I would do right by her children... and I would do right by her. And my drinking, I know... it took the family to a dark place. And I take that blame. But I'm in AA now, David. I'm sober five years. And I know you wouldn't see me while you were in prison. I... I understand that. So, I waited and I waited until you got out... so that I could see you... and apologize to you for the... the horrible things... that I did to you... and your mother... and Jackson. I'm sorry. And I'm trying here, David. I'm... I'm really, really trying. So, I'm just asking... for a second chance. Your mother's dying wish to me was to look after our boys. And that's exactly what I want to try and do. Because that's what family does. I'm sorry, Jackson. You're right. We were both drinking. I should never have let you drive. I'm your big brother, I'm supposed to protect you. I thought I was doing that, but... I realize now... where that's put you. I failed you as a brother... and a friend... and I'm sorry. Come on, man. It's okay. You're okay with me. Come on, it's okay. Yeah. It's okay. It's okay. Okay. Hello? Dylan. What are you doing here? I, uh, um... I just came to talk. I think we're a bit beyond that. Are you moving? Yeah and actually, we have to go soon. Mom? Where's my backpack? Why'd you do it? I'm so sorry. God, I'm sorry. I don't want to go. It's going to be okay. It'll be all right. You got a great mom here. Don't you forget it. You're going to meet so many new friends. No, this is yours now. You take care of this glove. You wear it every second of every day. Don't leave it in the rain, okay? I want to hear about your home run. Are you going to come to all my games? Well, I mean, I'll be able to... Yeah. I'll be there. Honey, go see if you left anything in your room. We gotta go. Goodbye, Mister. - Ava, I'm... - I know. Today, I'm here with my two sons, David and Jackson. Welcome David and Jackson. As some of you might remember from my story... you know that I hurt these two boys very... very badly. And I haven't been a part of their lives for a very long time because of my drinking. And because of what alcohol did to me and... in the end, to them. And it wasn't until the last few months that I've been able to reconnect with them. And they're going to try and let me... rebuild together. I can't... I can't take back what I did to them. All I can do is... try to make up for it in any way that I can. I call this room. Thought you'd be getting tired of the good old heel toe express. Holy shit, Jackson. You can't afford that. Don't worry about it. - No, take it back. - It's yours. Take it, bro. Are you kidding me, man? Can't have my big bro bus sing around. Do you remember how to bicycle? It's one foot after the other, okay bud? Yeah. Thanks. And now, I'd like to call up Jackson Arnold... for surpassing his 30-day-sober mark. Congratulations, Jackson. Woo! Come on, Dylan! Woo! Run! Woo! Ball four. Batter, take your base. Ump, time! Hey. Head up. All right. It's four-three us. Two outs. They got the bases loaded. And you just walked three straight guys. This kid on home plate could win the game for them. I should take you out. But I'm not going to do that. 'Cause you're our best pitcher. We need you here, buddy. All right, I'm going to go back to the dugout. I want you to throw three strikes straight down the middle and win this game for us. Can you do that? All right, now fist-bump me. Let's do this.
