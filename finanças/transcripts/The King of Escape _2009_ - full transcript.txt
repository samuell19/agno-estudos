See this blue? It goes with the hay and the grass. - So get the blue. - Everyone has it. Don't spend all day on the color! Mr. Lacourtade has things to do. Why pick an ugly one if I can pick a nice one? What's wrong with yellow? - I don't like it. - Well, I do. It matches the forest green, and the wheat, too. Back off, mom. I'm the one buying the tractor. I get to choose the color. Otherwise, there's red... It's classic and it fits in everywhere. The red? Really? Will you please go now? I just can't decide. You don't have to choose now. No hurry. I'll think it over. Keep the catalogue. Call me if you want. If you're ever in Albi, we can have a drink. Yeah? Yellow, I don't see, but I'm torn between blue and red. I do like the blue. - See you? - See you. - Are you around Thursday? - I can be. Come for lunch. Mom won't be home. We can talk in peace. Sure. OK. THE ESCAPE KING Armand? Armand. Are you OK? - I'm fine. - Are you sure? Yes. Why do you ask? I find you asleep by the roadside with your phone off... I wanted some quiet. You know I don't like that during work hours. - Want to get some coffee? - No, Durandot is waiting. He's furious. - Shit. - Exactly. Come on, let's get going. What's wrong with my sales tactics? You use your charm. That too. I'm a salesman. On a bachelor? ... who lives with his mother? It's a bit easy, no? And anti-competitive. We're digressing. Let's work this out. You bet we will! Your territory ends at Castelnau. The Gr?signe is mine. - That's really pushing it. - Yeah? Show me where Rapaille's house is! Here. Right. And the county border? - So? - Still, he wants to buy a McCormick. So what? I can find him a McCormick. But at what price? With the new free trade agreement, I can sell what I want for what I want. - Then I can sell where I want. - Yeah? And the Orleans Protocol? Ever heard of the Orleans Protocol? He's right, Armand. - We're dropping Rapaille. - What? We've wasted enough time. Drop him. - You caved in too fast. - Territories are territories. He could sue us and win. What? Over 200 meters? What's gotten into you lately? And Turlane's tractor? What are you doing about it? - That's a different story. - It was in the bag. - You want to go somewhere for a drink? - Look, Armand... if you don't shape up, I'll ship you to Tarn-et-Garonne. - Not Tarn-et-Garonne! - Then drop Rapaille. There's enough work in your territory. Go to S?gala. There are customers waiting. OK? What's up? I finally met the Old Goat. - Here? - By the river. It's not a legend, believe me. He's got some piece. Must be like this. - He's just your type, old. - I like mature men. Not old. I'm teasing. He must be 75, maybe 80. Great. Aside from his advanced age and his big cock, did you like him? Not particularly. Actually, not at all. I knew it. You're an idiot. We just had some fun. He also fed me something... something wild. - It makes you rock hard. - I can still get it up. - And it makes you incredibly horny. - I've heard it before. Forget whatever you've taken. I've never had anything like it, and I've tried everything. You stay lucid. No hallucinations or side effects. Do you even realize? Why take a drug to turn me on if I'm with someone who doesn't? Why not? Not wanting a guy means not wanting to want him. That's debatable. An upper can help get over the hump. But there has to be a spark, no? That stuff was so potent, you don't need one. Nonsense. So this means you can fuck anyone anytime? Come on, you've never done it with a dud? Well, I don't want to anymore. Let's face it, we make do with what we have. Sorry, I won't accept that. Sounds like a fun life... waiting for Mr. Right. No, but I'd rather have Mr. Not-So-Bad. Good luck with that. Cut it out! I said, cut it out! - Ow! - Come on. Knock it off! Ow! Stop! Stop it! Leave her alone! That depends. How much is she worth? You'll have to come get her. You'll regret it if I do. Sure, right. We'll kick your ass. Maybe, but I might take one or two down with me. I'd like to see you try. Stop looking at my code. Do it, or else. Or else, forget about the money. Move. What's your name? Curly. Coralie? No, Curly. - How do you spell it? - C-U-R-L-Y. I'm not familiar with it. - DURANDOT FARM EQUIPMENT - - NEW & USED - Mister, will you come in for a drink? No, it's late. Call me Armand. My parents will never believe me. I have to go. We looked everywhere for you! - Yeah? If you had... - Watch your tone! What the hell are you doing here? I got hassled by 4 assholes. Good thing he was there. Oh yeah? - Come in for a drink. - I was just leaving. Come! What could I do? Take one down, and the rest will scatter. That's easy for you to say. You just go in swinging. You're no runt, they'd get the idea. Meanwhile, I'm still out 200 Euros. Then you had them to spend. Yes, but they were my last 200 Euros. Then you should have fought. We'd like to, but we just can't right now. Fine. Let's just drop it. I'm beat. I'm going to bed. Armand! So, do we press charges? I'll take care of it. Take care how? I'm not sleepy, and I called Armand, not mom. Don't worry. - What for? - I want to say goodbye. Wait. She wants to say goodbye. Come. Can we be alone please! Stop hollering. Get lost! I have to go now, Curly. Good night. Pick me up tomorrow. Jean Jaur?s High School. I'm out at 4. Why are you here? Car trouble. Can I use your phone? What, no mobile? Nice going. Are you hungry? Come inside. Well, I'm off. Sorry I can't drive you, buddy, but we haven't finished eating. At your age? This is not right. Are you sure you'll retire by 60? By 70, I hope. How old do I look? You're not 70? Is it really my age that's bothering you? No, something else. Hurry, we don't have time. Armand? Don't be afraid. We're here to save you. Take it easy. Come on, hurry up! I'll get you some of my daughter's clothes. Meanwhile, Armand, go buy some food. Get some sausage... ham, cheese, and... You, what do you want? Yogurt please, with fruit. Fruit? OK. I'll get it. We found you a car. It's not much, but it'll do for now. Thanks. Armand, tell us, or we'll have to... The mechanic. He'll pay for trying to steal our daughters! The mechanic's been hanged in his garage! We don't do hangings. Call 911. But I know who did it! Aside from the Faggot King, I can't see anyone else hanging the Old Goat. Who's the Faggot King? You, silly. What do you mean, me? I didn't do it! They all say that! So tedious. Armand? I don't know where she is! I swear! - Who? - The girl! What girl? The young girl. The one we saved, the Old Goat and I. Come on, Armand, come back to bed. - Sleep now. It's all over. - Sure it is. Of course it is. Did we do it? And, to top it all off, we fucked. And very well at that. I didn't feel a thing. Do you mind if I stay? What, you do? We're at your place. - Jean Jaur?s High School - Want your car back? How much you got? Cut it out! - Can't I have a drink with her? - Shit yeah! No. - Cycling - - Basics - It doesn't come in triple? It's been discontinued. On the other hand, we can add a 50x34. A 50x34? Sure. See the rear cassette? It's 12 to 26. A 26 in the back? What's the gain ratio on 34x26? Not high. How does mine compare? - What do you have? - A 32x24. That's better. - The 32x24? - Definitely. Hello. What can I do for you? I have to eat. Oh, in that case, I can make you a mushroom omelet, a plate of cold meats to start, ham, dry sausage, p?t?. I also have duck rinds, and even pork rinds, and cheese. - Great. - Very well. Thank you. Excuse me, but the wine is warm. - I'll bring some ice. - Thanks. Ice cubes in wine? How else do I make it cold? Why didn't you put it in the fridge? It's broken. Ice will do just fine. No one asked you! Why the hell do we have a cellar? I don't appreciate your tone. You're really asking for trouble. Do you really want something to eat? Then sit down. And butt out. OK? You, bring him his precious ice cubes. Then please put the wine in the cellar! What the hell is going on? I can't sleep in peace without you tormenting poor Marinette? Sleeping at this hour! If I want to sleep until noon, you won't be the one to stop me. OK? OK? Good. Now that I'm up, I'll have my coffee... It's hot today. Well... Thank you. Goodbye. Drop by again. What are you doing here? We can't stay here. Come. Over there. I've heard it happens a lot the first time. True. Except it's not my first time. The first time with someone new. That's true, too. I just like being with you. Maybe if we wait a bit. What do you think? Curly, I have something really important to tell you. Usually, girls... aren't my thing. - I figured that out. - Yeah? How do you think I found you? Are you Curly Durandot? And you, Armand Lacourtade? Please follow us. Our turn. Well. What are we going to do with you? Nothing happened. You're found naked in the bushes, right next to a gay cruising spot. Let's not get carried away. I couldn't do anything. I only like men. Preferably married, I know. - Where did you hear that? - It's part of my job. Some men I like happen to be married. - That's not why I like them. - Mature, then. - Exactly. - So what? Doesn't that change things? What if I said that your liking older men leads me to believe you also like young girls? What happens now? Strictly speaking, we have nothing on you. You're free to go. But you'll have to wear this bracelet. That's for sex offenders! I'm not. Have you heard of the Family Protection Act? Read it over. Article 12. It says, by parental request. Do I look like a rookie? Do you want a lawyer? - He's suffered enough. - Bullshit! He never liked girls. He won't start now. Precisely. At 40, he's rethinking things. His partying days are over. He's alone, with no kids. How else can he have any? Have what? Most women his age already have kids. The others obviously have problems. Or they plain scare him. That leaves the young ones. To have a kid? Sure. All that so he can then realize he's a faggot for life. I don't want him knocking up my daughter and taking off. - That could happen with a straight man. - Less likely. You're imagining things, Daniel. Don't do this to him. Come on, withdraw your complaint. I'll talk to him. He likes me. We'll work something out. He likes you? You just put food on his table. Enough for tonight. You're getting on my nerves again. It's my daughter, Paul! You should fire him. Salesmen are easy to find. - So I'll see you tomorrow? - Yes. Do we make an offer? - We'll start at 1,000. - Cheaper than truffles? Relax. I'll handle Rapaille. He'll settle for 1,000. - Bye. - See you tomorrow. Why are you here? Can't I even get some fresh air? It's a school night! - It's not even 11. - No argument. I can feel it already! Keep it down! Damn, that's good shit! I'm still horny. Sorry, but I'm expecting company. And I have to make lunch. My mother's not home. - So, we're agreed on 1,000? - Oh, no! I don't know what you can resell for, but... - That seems low. - How much, then? At least double. No way! Double? You're not getting 2000! We'd all lose out. Come on, let's go. I'm late. Can we keep some? - You wish. - While you think it over. - Dream on! - Be reasonable! That's no way to have kids. Looking for Curly? She's not with me. So I see. I was hoping to find you before her father did. Lay low a while. Even for just one night. Stay home. Watch some TV. - Then what? - Call me. So you can take her home? So she can run away again? Look... Little girls belong with their families. If they run away, so be it. We can't put them in chains. Need a ride? What happened to you? You look a mess! I'll get you some of Robert's clothes. What happened? I fell into some brambles. Don't ask how. Come in, don't stand there! Hey! Small world. - You know each other? - From the caf?. - Want a beer? - What time is it? - Almost 7. - Maybe a pastis. I'm all out. Will Ricard do? Of course. Here. Try these pants on. And this shirt. Mom! He's not going to change here in front of everyone. Come, Armand. I expected you for lunch. I came. But I left when I saw my boss's car. You were very early. 11:30, noon. Actually, I wasn't expecting them. They called last night about the tractor. They came over and ended up staying longer than planned. Can I also borrow some briefs? Robert, lend him your green polo shirt! The T-shirt is perfect, ma'am. Don't come in, mom. He hasn't finished! He can't go to Albi dressed like a slob! I'm not going out on the town. Try this on. Since when have you had an electronic bracelet? Robert, he didn't have it before? No. I'm telling you, nowadays, you get this for nothing. Durandot wasn't looking to do me any favors to start with. She's the one chasing me. Tell her, she'll get the idea. No, she doesn't. What exactly do you tell her? At her age, I have to let her down easy. If you sleep with her... I didn't! We just kissed. If you sleep... If you kiss first and only then tell her it's impossible... - No wonder she's confused. - We only kissed once. At 16, once is enough. Especially if you're the first. I'd be surprised. Hey, Armand. Don't apologize for wanting to sleep with this girl. Don't look at me like that, Marthe. It's perfectly normal for a man to fall for a teenager, no? If you had your way, Jean, we'd all have sex with each other. He's right, mom. She's 16, no longer a child. She may be legal, but she's still a minor. If her parents don't consent, that's that. Anyway, it's a problem, even for Mr. Lacourtade. Well, I have to go. You're not staying? Dinner is in 15 minutes. Just enough time for another Ricard. - No, thanks. - Well, I'm off. - You, too? - Bye. I'm turning in early tonight. But dinner's ready. See you tomorrow. Invite me over. No. I don't at all feel like it. You really don't want to stay, Jean? Very well. Fucking unbelievable. Now there's only the Internet and Toulouse left for cruising. - Drinks? - No, we stay. No one's here. Of course not, if we all leave. Stay, but I'm history. Don't be an idiot. If we don't make a stand, it's the end of open-air cruising in Albi. Wait. What's the meaning of this bracelet? What's it for? Are you that into her? - In theory, yes. - So, no. I am. But it's complicated when I'm with her. Come on, Armand. Either you're into her, or you're not. Trust me. It's not that simple. You really think you could sleep with a girl? Why not? It can't be that hard. If it was that easy, you'd have noticed by now, no? Have you tried? Don't tell me you're gay just for the fun of it. Just for the freedom and the party atmosphere. That's part of it. So you had other options? Look, Jean-Jacques, I never asked for permission, but I'm convinced I had a choice. I chose to live this way. I had a choice, and even past 40, I still want one. That life used to be a blast. Now it's a drag. If most men like women, have kids, build families, and always have, maybe it's not so bad. Maybe we can't do better. Hello? Stop that, Armand. It's late. Go to bed. - Yeah? - What the hell are you doing? Marty has been waiting 3 weeks and Brignac is screaming for his tractor. - Shall I go on? - I haven't been feeling well lately. I noticed. Let's talk about this in person. This morning? Right now, if you don't mind. The farmers can see you really care about them. The numbers prove it. We've more than doubled our sales. Stop worrying I'll fire you or transfer you to Tarn-et-Garonne. You know I'd never do that to you. - That's not what you said the other day. - Only because I was angry. Don't you believe me? What if you take a couple of weeks off? Get your health back. I'll lend you my place on the shore if you like. Come on, tell me what you want. This can't go on. No, it can't. Well? - You really want me to tell you? - Yes. I want to sleep with you. How long has it been on your mind? From the start. Say I accept. Then what? I go back to work. Sure, I could force myself once. To make you happy. Maybe. You'll never turn me on. - You don't know that. - Yes, I do. What if, let's say... I made you come with my mouth? You wouldn't have to do much and... I'd be so pleased. You would do that? With nothing in return? Follow me, Armand. Come on. You couldn't wait 5 minutes? - I can't let you do just anything. - What the hell is it to you? We're responsible people. If we want to fuck, we fuck. It's none of your business. Don't you know how to do your job? Do you, Armand? Yes, I do know, thank you. You give your boss head to go back to work, but everything's fine. We have the right to want our boss. Did he feed you anything? A sort of potato, tastes like a kiwi, with a hint of vanilla. Sound familiar? Or a powder he might have put in your coffee? A drug? We didn't have coffee, or anything else. You haven't heard of this new stuff? "Doo-root." Does it ring a bell? No. You surprise me. It should be a hit in gay circles. You didn't come out here on the off chance Paul laced my coffee. - Lost Curly again? - No. But things are going very badly. We're this close to calling in the R.S.P.A.D. What the hell is that? The Regional Service for the Prevention of Adolescent Deviancy. You really must help us. I have no idea how. Take a vacation. Leave town. Come now, Armand. You know you can't go on like this. It's true. I can't. You're right. I'm taking off. Let me know where and when. - You win. I'm going on vacation. - Win? We could go get a bite. Let's not part like this. No, thanks. I'm not hungry. Hello? It's Curly. I'll be right there. Let's not stay here. Come on. Someone's coming. Let's go. Hurry! Come on, Curly. I'm beat. Here. Eat this. It'll give you a boost. What is it? You'll see. Taste it. Come on. You know him in town, but you can't recognize him in the forest? I recognized him in your photo. We also told you we saw a man running with... From behind. With a girl. The girl easily could have been a boy. They weren't that close. But our sensor, which is quite accurate, tells us he spent some time around here. Any idea what he might have been looking for? Where does your thingy say he is? Is he still headed for Puycelsi? Yes, and he's gaining speed. And you're spending all day here? You're right. Let's go. Aren't you coming? What use are we? Usually, when a fugitive's at large, everyone pitches in. Barring other emergencies, of course. Do you have an emergency? Bringing in the hay. - But that can wait. - Yes. We're not expecting rain. This stuff rules, Armand! I want to make love to you! Me too, Curly! - Let me try. - Are you sure? Careful, you're close. Sorry. Hand me a tissue. What's that? You'll love it. It feels great! Put some on the head. What is it? "Cool Sensations." 6 euros at the supermarket. The supermarket? Careful, don't come inside me. Don't worry, I'm clean. No, that's not it. Oh, that's right. - Lie down. - What are you doing? No, not like that. You'll see, it feels really good. Stop! Relax. It's easy with Cool Sensations. I don't want to! Stop! Jerk! - You're a real bastard! - Softly! Well, maybe I... ... want them to find us. Calm down, Curly. You okay? - Come on. - Can't you fuck normally? Do you always have to be twisted? It's not twisted. Lots of normal people, straight included, fuck like that. Maybe, but they ask first, no. Not necessarily. At least, they stop if one of them wants to stop. Let's go inside. It's getting cold. I promise not to touch you. But I want you to touch me. Well... he's a force to be reckoned with. They were spotted between Graulhet and Lautrec. So what? Can you cover 50 km by foot overnight? - Never tried. It doesn't sound huge. - You must be in shape. It's only 5 km/hr. After all they ran yesterday? While avoiding road blocks? Through the fields. Are you putting me on? Sorry, Chief. I didn't think about all that. So. Can any of you shed a little light on the matter? Something that makes you run fast and think even faster...? No? Let's just go to Lautrec. Who cares how fast they run? Jocasse, show me the map of Lautrec. - You told him? - The Chief? - No, Lacourtade! - No. Curly, look! Good job, my love. You did good. Not too close. It won't cook otherwise. Fine. You're the one eating it. Cook yours how you want. Wait, Armand. I want to try something. Do you like it like this? Yeah, keep going. I'm gonna come. Come! Get dressed. Stop it! Enough of your bullshit! Help me, damn it! - Don't kill him! - I won't kill him. Come on, I didn't rape her. She's not a child anymore. Face it. She's only 16! That's when it starts. What can I tell you? - I'm not asking. - I'm telling you. Plus I don't want to die, so lower the rifle. Go ahead. What? You don't have the balls to jump? No, I don't. Let him go, dad! I won't see him again! Talk to him! - Easy, Daniel. Call the Chief. - I'll handle it! Even if we pull the crop, he might still talk. If they don't find it, we'll replant. And it would be a shame to lose the whole crop. Listen. Durandot decided to stop by. Not very smart of him to come here. He's right. Pull the crop. Okay. But that doesn't answer my question. When do we do it? - Tonight. - At night? I'm nervous. At night, they sleep like everyone else. It's not practical, either. You three are inseparable. What brings you here? Nothing much. I was in the forest, I thought, go by Robert Rapaille's place, and if you see a light on, stop in for a drink. And I saw a light. - Armand, I found a warm-up suit. - Cool, Curly. Try not to use the lights, Curly. Hey, Armand? Look what I found. Great, Curly! Do we open it? - Are you happy? - Yeah. Do you see me repeating the 10th grade at 16? When all I want is some job training, with a paycheck at the end. A diploma is nice and all, but what good is it if I'm unemployed? I graduated and I have a job. Back then, it was different. There was work to be found. It's not like I graduated in the '70s. - No? How old are you? - 43 Ah, okay. You don't look it. It was still easier back then. Take my cousin Brandon He graduated 7 or 8 years ago. He even went to college. Now he sits at home all day. His diploma's not to blame. Yeah, but Brandon says, if he had apprenticed in masonry or butchery, he'd have work. Take my parents. They finished high school. Look at them now! And the idiots want me to graduate. You don't have to keep calling them idiots. If you had failed in life, would you nag your kids to live the same life? No, I'd nag them to succeed. But I wouldn't necessarily stop them following my example. Like getting a diploma. It can't ruin your life. Or your parents' lives. Stop taking their side! Why attack them? First, we live in a slum. My dad hates his job, which pays nothing. And our vacations suck when we do take them! But the worst is, they're miserable together. They just sit around, bored. - You don't know that. - I see it every day. Do they tell you they're miserable? No, but it's obvious. You call that making it? Look, I have a good job, a boss who pays well, plenty of vacation, an apartment in town. And I have plenty of fun. But I'm still not sure I made it. Maybe because you don't have kids. Your folks accomplished that much. It's not that hard. Meanwhile, we're the ones getting hell. - Who's "we?" - The kids. Look what I found! It's okay, no one saw me. Keep this up, and you're the one who'll get us caught. Could you stop pacing? You're giving me a headache. Armand, it's ready! Let's eat. Wait up! - What are you doing? - I'm fed up. I'm going home. - What if they catch you? - They'll do it sooner or later. We spend two days running and you give up just when we get away? You'd rather rot here until the cows come home? We're happy together, with a house and stuff. But they need time to understand! Understand what? That we're in love and can't be apart. They'll give in. If it means getting married, no thanks. But I want to live with you, to sleep next to you, get it? I get it. And I'm not sure that's what I want. Not with you, anyway. Not with me? What? - Who with then? - I don't know yet. Do you know many guys who love you like I do, moron? Well, do you, Armand? It's no use, Curly. It's over. Not for me. Stop! I fell! What are you doing? Armand, enough! Come back! Stop! You gonna stop or not? What are you doing? Ow, that hurts! Stop it! What the fuck are you doing? Untie me! - I'm not kidding! - Stop moving. Don't worry, Curly. A car will pass by and someone will see you. OK? Please, Armand, don't leave me here alone! I really have to go. Armand, I love you! Faggot! Yes? See you soon. - Where is she? - Look... - No! You let me see her! I'm not sure it's such a good idea. Well, I guess we'll be going. Go ahead. - Where is she? - Calm down. Fine. I'm calm. I can't stop you from seeing her. Jocasse, would you escort them? Are you coming? I have another lead. Let's go. Yeah, Armand! Fuck, yeah, Armand! - Don't stop, Armand, yeah! - Yeah! Go on, get your rocks off! Fuck me, fuck me! Armand! Your ass feels so good! You're on fire tonight, you little rascal. What's this? I don't know. The three of us were having fun. They took some doo-root. It went to their heads. They started talking about you, Armand this, Armand that. Then they got turned on and they've been at it since late afternoon. What about you? I don't need that. I prefer the real thing. What's wrong? You've been chasing me for days. Don't play hard to get! Me chasing you? And not just to make conversation! Look... You're a nice guy, but... How do I put it? - I'm too old? - For starters. - And? - You're not my type. I see. You don't want to kiss me, huh? So don't. No big deal. Look, I'm exhausted. Your willie doesn't look tired. Got anything to eat? Want some doo-root? No, more like bread, ham, cheese... I think I have some cookies left. Come inside. The cabin is comfortable. Come on! This way... Wait, wait! Wait, Armand! Stop! What's wrong? You... you're gonna make me come. - Don't you want to? - Not right now. - But I want you to. - You want me to come? Yeah. Really, I'd rather wait. That way... we can fuck again later, when you're up to it. - That's funny. - I don't see why. When I think that, for 30 years, I fucked my wife every day, no exceptions. Even when she had her period. Not to mention the girls on the side. Evenings, when I went out to meet men, I wasn't happy until I'd had 5 or 6. Then came Robert. With him, it was three times a day. And... not just mindless quickies, either. Each time, we'd take it from the beginning. Can you imagine how much strength that took? Another thing, only a few years ago, I couldn't imagine getting laid without coming. Yup. It would actually piss me off. We can be so stupid! But now, I'm not saying I don't let go once in a while, but I try to hold back all I can, and it's great. That way I can fuck for hours on end. And if I can't get hard... Because, let's face it, nothing is forever except death and taxes. Well, no sweat. We do something else. The best part is: As long as I don't come, my love stays alive. The tragedy of it is, I had to wait until 70 to understand that. So I should give up coming just to go on wanting to? That's up to you. Tell me, does getting off make you happy? Sure, you're happy before and during. But what about after? You know what, Jean? I really want to kiss you. Then kiss me. Can we join you?
