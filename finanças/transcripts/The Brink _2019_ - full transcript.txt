Man: Housing, jobs, unemployment, record level low. Uh, all sorts of good shit happening and, you know, and there's an article... But if you give me any... if you give me any juice at all, let me give you some ideas, and I'll start doing spots. We have to do this. I need you to either email me or text me facts, just factoids right now, and I'll draft it up some spots, in fact, if you get 'em to me I'll have spots cut for you and you can look at. Man: (indistinct chatter) You talk about culture being up river from politics. This is the way you make a statement. I'll see you at five o'clock and I'll feed you dinner. Bye. Man: All right, bye. Bannon: I had a great film. The Phil Robertson movie. Maybe my craziest film. - What was the title of it? - Fleuette: Torchbearer. Torch... The Torchbearer? Or Torchbearer? The Torchbearer. - Fleuette: No Torchbearer. - Torchbearer. - Fleuette: Torchbearers. - Torch... Torchbearers. We went from Athens. Did we go to Jerusalem? - Athens, Rome. - Fleuette: No, Athens. - Warsaw. - Uh, not Warsaw. - (stammers) - Fleuette: We went to Auschwitz. Auschwitz. Birkenau. - Fleuette: France. - My shit in Auschwitz rocked. We leave for Birkenau, right, and this gets to the punchline of the story. I look around, and I turn to the curator and I go, "Man." I said this is the most haunting place I think I've ever been. I just... It's something about this. This is actually the feeling I thought I was gonna feel in Auschwitz. (chuckles) And he goes, "Oh, everybody says that." And I go, "What are you talking about?" He goes, "Oh, no, no, no." He says, "Maybe I didn't explain it." He said Auschwitz was a Polish cavalry college. The Germans just requisitioned it immediately, and that was like the beta site test. This was made from scratch. German industrial design. He says the whole thing's perfect. And I'm walking around going, "Oh, my God." It's precision engineering to the nth degree. By Mercedes and Krupp and Hugo Boss and the whole... It is a institutionalized industrial compound for mass murder. Here it finally hits you that... Think about it, good people back in Germany were sitting at their desks drawing and having arguments and meetings like you have at any company in the world. No, I think this... I mean, this thing was so planned and so engineered down to perfection, you could see the conference meetings, you could see all the cups of coffee and all the meetings and all the argument. There were people that actually sat and thought through this whole thing and totally detached themselves from, you know, the moral horror of it. That's when you realize, "Oh, my God, humans can actually do this." Humans that are not devils, right? But humans that are just humans. (whirring) - Bannon: What... Is this... is this from the dietitian? - Sean: That's protocol. - Bannon: This is protocol? - Sean: Protocol. Bannon: Okay, fine. So, I'm gonna tell her you're either with the program - or not with the program? - Sean: Right. Have you tasted this? I mean hers were so good. - Sean: Hers were better? - Oh, man, hers were amazing. Sean: Is it kinda veggieish? It's not veggieish it's just got a funky taste but I'll try... I'll keep doing it. - Mm. - Sean: I gotta perfect it. That's okay, it's your first time. - Don't worry, you suck. - Sean: (chuckles) Bannon: My goal is to lose 35 pounds. I was in terrible shape when I took over the campaign. I don't know if you saw picturs but I mean, it was... I was scary. I'd see these pictures and I'd go, "Who is that guy?" - (microwave beeps) - Of course, then... (chuckles) then you get the comments section... this gross looking Jabba the Hutt drunk. You know, I'd go, "Oh, my God." So funny. (keypad clicking) (camera shutter clicking) (camera shutter clicking) Bannon: Are we gonna take this country back? Crowd: Yes. (applauding) Bannon: Are we gonna return it to its former greatness? Crowd: Yes! Bannon: It was divine providence that guided us to victory in 2016. Crowd: No ban, no registry, fuck white supremacy. No ban, no registry, fuck white... Bannon: Islam is not a religion of peace. - Islam is a religion of submission. - (screaming) Female Reporter: A horrific scene in the wake of Charlottesville. The calls for him to go have grown a lot louder. Crowd: Blood and soil! Blood and soil! Blood and soil! Blood and soil! Female Reporter 2: A man who proudly promoted - right wing nationalism... - Male Reporter: ...is leaving his post. - Female Reporter 1: ...is out. - Male Reporter 2: Is out. - (keypad clicking) - (phone notification chimes) Bannon: The White House. There's literally no glamour to the job. There's no glamour to the job at all. I... I hated every second I was there. You know, you go to a church or a temple or a mosque or something like that. You can get the vibe of all the prayers and the... and, you know, the mantras and just the energy, the positive energy that... that these places, you know, have. Um... And then you go into like a Jersey strip club at like one o'clock on a Saturday afternoon and you get the vibe of like, there's a lot of bad stuff that's happening, right, just the vibe... the vibes of sacred and the profane, right. The White House, there's got... I'm telling you, the West Wing has got a bad karma to it. It just had a bad feel. They would say, "Because you were doing evil stuff." I actually thought I was doing the Lord's work. Driver: Where are they keeping the protestors, do we know? Passenger: Out front, main entrance. About 30 of them right now. Man: Make a hole. Hey, uniforms in front. Break off to the press box. Just walk that off, the rest of us will keep going. Male Reporter 1: Bannon plans to go on the warpath against opponents of President Trump unchained from the constraints of the White House and now is free to go out and do whatever he wants. Host: So it's my distinct honor and pleasure to introduce Steve Bannon to all of you. Thank you. (crowd cheering and applauding) Bannon: Is that a group of deplorables way in the back? (crowd cheers and applauds) Do not believe the opposition party. Do not believe the fake news and fake media. This agenda is what America needs now, it's what America needs to rebuild its future. Now, what do I mean by this agenda? We talk about economic nationalism. And what they're trying to do is smear the Trump... the Trump deplorables and that was Hillary's Clinton's speech. She was smearing them as nativist and racist. Right? Nothing could be further from the truth. Economic nationalism is what binds us together. It doesn't matter what your race is or what your religion is or what your gender is or what your sexual preference is. You know what he cares about? You're a citizen of the United States of America. - That's what he cares about. - (crowd cheering and applauding) We're gonna have you come back. Okay, next. Great smile, you guys. - Perfect. - Photographer: Thank you. Female attendant: Thank you very much. - Okay, give him a smile. - I share everything you do. - Don't touch me. - We need to move. Don't... He's talking to me. (all laugh) Bannon: You know, I'm on a mission to convert as many of these people as possible to the populist cause. 'Cause they understand. The elites in our country and actually throughout the world, but particularly in the United States... are comfortable with managing our decline. They just are. I saw the glob... impact of globalization 'cause coming out of Harvard, and particularly doing mergers and acquisitions, the whole restructuring of industrial America was the... was about shipping... shipping jobs out. I mean, you could actually see that there was a process, there's a globalization process. They had no thing of a social cost, nothing of civic society, it was all tied to the benefits to the equity. - Bannon: The C4's not ready? - Woman: We could, you know, call you right back. Bye, bye, bye, bye, text me, I'll call you. Surabian: What is the status of your C4 right now? I just need to know that we're not breaking any laws. I... Yeah, that's number one, the Levy stuff. Number two is, at the very least, you just need to have... you have to have a home page. - I've got that. I've got that. - With a... Okay, so they can... - they can enter in their email address. - I've got their email address. - Coming soon. - Everything. - I've got a logo done, everything's done. - And you would be announcing... Is Citizens for America a good title? - Citizens for America? - Citizens for America. - Why not. - It sound like Citizens United. - Yeah. - Yeah, but hold on. Firstly, this movement is all about citizens, right? You can do, you know, it's organizing for America. Then you can do truckers for America and women for America, and all this stuff. You can play off all the little groups and things. Surabian: Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Epstein: I would love to have your endorsement. Bannon: Yeah, so... so what happens is that, I actually don't endorse. I know it seems like I do. - You probably hear it every day. - Yeah, no, no, no, no. Because I get the co... I... it's these coalition guys we pull together so you get 25 endorsements. Surabian: I'm assuming you guys have talked to the White House, - probably. - Yes. You know, maybe we'll talk, uh, later about doing a fundraiser or something like that. Thank you, how can I be of help to you? Going forward, what can I do for you? Just do exactly what you did on the campaign. I mean, you're a fighter. You totally get Trump. - You never wavered. - Epstein: Yes. If we could replicate you we'd be in great shape. And then she had a baby three weeks ago as well, so, um... - Isn't that cool? - Such an animal. So Trump... what a Trump move. Epstein: You know, I was hoping that President Trump would sign my belly. That was the one thing that never happened. I wanted him to sign my belly and say the next generation - of Trump Republicans. - Bannon: I love it. We're giving birth. - He probably would've loved it. - Bannon: I love it. - He would have. - Bannon: He would've loved it, what are you talking about. We have two Americas, I feel. Uh, you have folks who feel like they have a fair shot, um, and they can participate in... in... in the economy and... and in the political process, and you have folks who don't. And then you have folks who have the advantages, increasingly more educated, increasingly more coastal. And you have pop values and you have core values. I believe that the democrat marketing machine has got a lot of us fooled. And I believe that feeds into the pop values of gender is fluid, and there is no right and wrong. Yeah. You put these pieces together, could be amazing. And like we'll introduce you to all the... - James: Yeah. - ...Evangelical groups and everybody else, you know, or I suppose coalition. And you were never like a never Trump guy - or anything like that? Okay. - Bannon: Perfect. - You guys are gonna coordinate. - Surabian: Yeah. - Real honor. - James: Thank you, sir. This guy is very impressive. Male Reporter: A controversial judge running for senate. - I believe in the second amendment. - (crowd hooting) Male Reporter: Alabama's Roy Moore is accused of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl years ago. Female Reporter 1: At least nine women accuse Moore of wrongdoing. Man: Welcome to the Citadel folks. Female Reporter 2: And of course, Steve Bannon - is sticking with Roy Moore. - Bannon: I think Roy Moore is the guy that's gonna represent, uh, Donald Trump - and fight the establishment. - (music playing) - Bannon: Hey, how you doing? - Woman: Jean Comp. - Bannon: Hey, how you doing? - Jean: Good to have you - with us. - Bannon: Thank you. Hey, man, how you doing? Hey, brother, how you doing? - Jean: Big fans of yours. - Bannon: Right in the middle, rose between two thorns. No right here, get in the middle. - Female Guest: Oh, okay. - Rose between two thorns. - Oh, wow. - Female Photographer: One, two, three. - Emma wants a selfie. - Emma: Do you want to take it? No, I don't know how to do it. - Shit. How do we do it? Do we take it like that? - Sure. You get in the middle. Right here. - Female Guest 2: Just me? - Bannon: Yeah, we gotta get the rose in the middle. - Male Guest 1: Oh, there we go. There you go. Perfect. - Bannon: Come on. Bannon: I was there on Billy Bush, Billy Bush weekend. When that video came out, right? Is it just a coincidence that the Bezos, Amazon, Washington Post, did the Billy Bush hit? And they did the hit on Judge Moore. Yeah, just a complete random thing in the universe, right? And the mainstream media... Woman 3: - Bannon: And... And the mainstream media... - (crowd booing) Bannon: Hang on, hang on, hang on. I'd like to thank one of my ex wives for showing up and... (crowd laughs) I swear I thought that lawyer sent that alimony check, I'll get back to ya. You're a good girl. You got the right for free speech outside. (crowd laughs) - (indistinct chatter) - Can I get a quote from him? - What's the strategy for Moore to come back? - Caddell: Are you... - who are you with? - He's with Bloomberg now. - I did the Bannon book. - He wrote Devil's Bargain. Caddell: Oh! Oh, right. - Oh, I know who you are. - He made two million dollars off the book you could've written. - Yeah. - Caddell: Yeah, and I could've done better, I mean. What's the Caddell strategy for Moore fighting back? Caddell: And let the governor appoint. Do not let them steal your seat. Green: Yeah, that's a very Bannon line - right there. - Caddell: What? Green: Do not let them steal your seat. Uh, so, I got a couple quotes from Bannon just before he went out, he's, uh, in there giving a speech. Can I... can I read them, you know, like a... like - a regular TV reporter would? - Cameraman: Okay. Okay, I'm new to this... this TV correspondent stuff so. Bannon wound up speaking to Moore this afternoon. He said they are both, uh, standing four square together. He's encouraging Moore to stay in the race. Moore wants to stay in the race. Uh, and so it looks like they're gonna fight on. Kassam: And... and you have those moments of like levity and everything. That'll be great. (indistinct chatter) Kassam: I turned my light on to blind her as well so I got her right in the face. - Bannon: Let me see her. - Kassam: Yeah. It's a bit ostentatious. I just want... I just want to see the reaction when the Muslim guy walks in with the gun. (indistinct chatter) Kassam: I don't even think of that anymore. Kassam: You want anything from the kitchen? What do... they got Red Bulls down there? - What do they got? - Kassam: No, they do not have Red Bull. Bannon: They got anything with caffeine in it? - Kassam: Tea. - Can I get a Coke? - Kassam: Yeah. - I actually had a kombucha and I left it at the frickin' house. Fleuette: Does that have caffeine in it? I don't know what it's got in it but it jacks me up. Fleuette: Oh, nice. Of course, once the film comes out and people know I drink kombucha the stock will drop 50 percent. Kassam: (laughing) All right, pound it 'cause I don't wanna get in trouble. Sean: You got like... What... what time is it? Bannon: He's not doing a press conference, is he? Kassam: Veterans Day event. Did he already talk? Moore? - Oh, at the Veterans Day? - Yeah, was that a Moore event? - Or that was just a chyron? - Veterans Day. - Okay, fine. - Kassam: I sound like I'm talking to an 80 year old man. Radio Host: Sirius XM Patriot 125. (music playing) Bannon: Talk radio is still very powerful. The left has never figured out how to do talk radio. But talk radio is such a powerful weapon for the right. Let's go to Carol in Maryland, Carol in Maryland you're on Breitbart News Saturday. - How can we help you, Ma'am? - Carol, you are live. Carol: It is such an honor to talk to you and listen, I need to tell you, I have been a listener since day one. And my husband made fun of me and he called me a wackadoo, and within two weeks he was a devoted listener. The day that you joined the Trump campaign my husband said, Steven K, he grabbed the musket and ran towards the fire. I think that that's what we all need to do every day. Kassam: You've only got eight minutes going back. Why, has he got breaking news or what's... what's happening? Yeah, dude, so Moore just addressed the allegations - live on stage at the Veterans Day event. - They do a great job? I don't know, but he talked about it at length. Bannon: In the middle of a battle it comes down to one or two decisions. Now one decision is gonna lead to victory and the other decision is gonna lead to defeat. That was Billy Bush weekend. Male Protester 1: Steve Bannon is a piece of shit and we don't welcome him here in New York His hate and his candidate, Roy Moore, can go fuck himself. Female Reporter 1: Tonight, we call... Bannon: This is about destroying Roy Moore and you know why they wanna destroy Roy Moore? They want to destroy anybody that will step up and speak in your behalf. Whether it's Donald Trump, whether it's Judge Roy Moore, whether it's Breitbart News, they're at full out war. Breitbart news is still spreading lies, conspiracy theories, racism, division, and hatred. We are not backing down one inch. We wanted Bannon out that door. - (crowd cheering) - Bannon, - bye, bye, bye. - Bannon: This is called take out the sword and throw away the scabbard. Female Protester: Bye, bye, Bannon. Crowd: Bye, bye, Bannon. Bannon: They want to destroy Judge Roy Moore and you know why? They want to take your voice away. Maitlis: Why did you back Roy Moore? Bannon: We had an establishment candidate versus an evangelical Christian. The Christian right is a foundational layer of this populist movement. There's nothing better than spending a rainy night in Alabama with a bunch of deplorables. Male Reporter: Ivanka Trump, said, she believed the accuser and that there's a special plae in hell for people who prey on children. There's a special place in hell... (crowd cheering and applauding) ...for Republicans who should know better. (crowd cheers and applauds) Male Reporter 1: For the first time in a quarter of a century, Alabama is sending a Democrat to Washington. Male Reporter 2: A big victory for Democrat Doug Jones, and a humiliating defeat for Moore, for the President, and for Bannon. Female Reporter 1: It is finally here, Michael Wolff's much anticipated new book, Fire and Fury. Male Reporter 3: The controversial book appears to have opened a rift between the President and his former chief strategis, Steve Bannon. Female Reporter 2: Steve Bannon... Male Reporter 4: Calling that meeting at Trump Tower with Don Jr., Jared Kushner, and that Russian lawyer, "treasonous". Female Reporter 2: Unpatriotic, and he says team Trump should have called the FBI immediately. Male Reporter 4: Steve Bannon now finds himself in the crosshairs of the Russia investigation, the first time special counsel Robert Mueller's team has used a grand jury subpoena to compel information from a member of President Trump's inner circle. (notification chimes) Male Reporter 5: The President says, "After Bannon lost his White House job he lost his mind." Male Reporter 6: "Sloppy Steve" is Trump's new nickname for Steve Bannon, and I have to admit it's a good one. (crowd applauding) Bannon: This is in 1862. Lincoln asked, "What do these men want?" Browning answered, "I hardly know, Mr. President, but they are exceedingly violent towards your administration." And Lincoln said, "They wish to get rid of me. And I am sometimes half disposed to gratify them. We are now on the brink of destruction. It appears to me the Almighty is against us. And I can hardly see a ray of hope." That's Abraham Lincoln. They're trying to get rid of me. Bannon: You'll send me this one individually or something? - Send all them? - Fleuette: I can... I can print - every single one of these. - Bannon: Okay, fine. You know what, that might be me at Goldman Sachs my first year. - Or no. You know what that is? - Fleuette: That's what your dad - thought it was. - Bannon: No, you know, what it was, that's my second year - at Harvard Business School. - Fleuette: Really? Bannon: God, did I clean up. That guy's a movie star. That's money right there. There's been some bad years. (laughs) There's been a whole lot of tough... It's been a lot of tough road. God, I hate looking at old pictures. - That's me as a naval officer. - Fleuette: Okay. I'm at the Pentagon actually, I think. Fleuette: Dude, you look just like freakin' David Bowie. Bannon: I guess that's a compliment. Fleuette: Come on, man. - Bannon: That's my sophomore. - Fleuette: Virginia Tech, - right? - Bannon: That's my sophomore year of college and I ran for class president. - Fleuette: Yeah. - Bannon: And I actually won. - Fleuette: Yep, yep. - Bannon: And they took it away from me because they found a rule that I was actually on probation. And I think I punched out an RA during a keg party. Bannon: (laughs) - That's the campaign. - Fleuette: There's... Yeah. Bannon: The only real choice. and I think I got... - That's pretty badass. - Yeah. Look at that, I had multiple shirts then. - (Fleuette laughs) - Anybody that said I didn't have multiple shirts, look, I got like five shirts on. Let's go back to the top, I just wanna see 'em again. I haven't seen these in years. Man: We have a problem with Brexit, that so many conservatives, despite being elected on a ticket of delivering Brexit, now seek to delay it, now seek to water it down and you in America have exactly the same problem with members of Congress - doing their damnedest to stop the President - (applause) from getting his agenda through. (cheering and applauding) It's an enemy within. It's an enemy within. Basically... basically where we are, is, we will be staying part of everything until 2022. We'll still be paying ten billion pounds a year. The only difference is, it won't be called EU membership and we won't have a say and we won't have a vote. In fact, it'll be a worse form of membership than we've currently got now. So, it's really bad. It's really really bad. If you're interested, what I'd like to do is set up something, and I'll fund it somehow... that I think... and I think you're the perfect guy. We help knit together this populist nationalist movement throughout the world. 'Cause guys in Egypt are coming to me, the Modi's guys in India, Duterte, you know, and... and we get Orban and we are somehow some sort of convening authority for conferences and stuff like that. So, we can get ideas out there. I mean, do you think that's a... - Do you think that's a worthwhile thing? - It's... Yeah, it's... I know, - I think it is. - Nobody's got... - nobody's doing it right now. - Um, it's not being done. The reason we're gonna beat Corbyn and Sanders is they're not prepared to take on the powers that be. We're fire breathers, I mean, we're taking on the establishment everyday. You've taken on the Tory Party. I'm taking on the Republican Party. - Yeah. - They don't have that. And that's why we can steal a march in them. And the... and the reason they don't wanna do it, it's immigration. As long as they don't take on the immigra... they just refuse to take on the immigration. - We're prepared to take it on. - Yes. It's a global revolt. It's a zeitgeist. We're on the right side of history. But it's gonna need the motive power. And the thing that's missing is, that's what I'm really trying to put together now, is the ideas. The ideas have to come in more sharp focus. The economic ideas, the political ideas. Farage: You've also moved, Steve, into a different place. Yeah. The minute you stood up on that stage in Alabama, - you became a different figure. - Bannon: Yeah. You're in a different place now. You're not just fixing stuff and operating behind the scenes - and making it happen... - Yeah. ...you're now the face of it. I'm gonna come back to you with the structure of this thing. I tell people Brexit and 2016 are inextricably linked. Victory begets victory. Female Reporter 1: If 2017 looked like the year when moderate politicians took back Europe, look again. Male Reporter 1: Far right populists seem to be on the rise across Europe. Front National leader and presidential Candidate, Marine Le Pen, claims Trump's victory is energizing her own populist message. Translator: Whether you're a man or a woman, Christian, Jewish or Muslim, heterosexual or homosexual, you are first and foremost French. Male Reporter 2: They've adopted the rhetoric of the old left. They're going after white working class voters. Not just making these cultural arguments about immigrants flooding our societies but they're actually saying we will protect your welfare state for you and no one else. Male Reporter 3: Le Pen has changed the party's name to The National Rally to broaden its appeal. Male Reporter 1: But Marine Le Pen campaigned for her father when he was saying the gas chambers are a detail of history. (crowd cheers and applauds) Male Reporter 4: The right wing Alternative for Germany party or AfD entered parliament for the first time with 13 percent of the vote. Crowd: Wir sind das Volk! Wir sind das Volk. Female Reporter 1: "Wir sind das volk." In German, it means, "We are the people." It was also heard in Clausnitz as a mob of Germans surrounded a bus of refugees entering their town. And later that year in Bautzen as 80 Germans chased some 20 teenage refugees - through the streets. - Crowd: (indistinct shouting) - Female Reporter 2: In Hungary... - Man 1: Viktor Orban sees himself as the defender of Christian Europe. Male Reporter 1: Building fences and detention camps along its borders. Male Reporter 2: In the world according to Viktor Orban, Hungary is a fortress under siege. George Soros is seen as the person organizing this Muslim invasion. Female Reporter 1: Extremists cast him as a central figure in a secret cabal of Jews and globalists working to take over the world. Female Reporter 2: The political earthquakes in Europe continue to rumble. (talking in foreign language) Man: There's a dangerous trend throughout Europe and we need to pay attention to it. Female Reporter 1: This time in Italy... Male Reporter 1: Unprecedented populist coalition... Translator: Earned better than 50 percent of the vote while the establishment political parties lost big. Bannon: Ideas in the political marketplace travel like ideas in the financial marketplace. If something happens in the city of London, next day it's in Wall Street, the next day it's in Singapore and Tokyo and Hong Kong. Same thing with political ideas. Woman 1: This is where they moved to the local news... - Great to meet you in person. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Definitely. Morgan: Floor Manager: In five seconds, four, three... Reid: You call it populism, and people see it as incredibly divisive... And actually, at times, racist. The Muslim ban, for instance. It was a necessary jolt to the system. He was trying to get people to pay attention. This kind of populist nationalist movement you see throughout Europe, it is not racist. If you look in Hungary, if you look in Poland, - if you look in Italy. - Reid: The protest in Charlottesville, by racists, why did Donald Trump say there were many fine people - on both sides? - Bannon: Because... Hang on for a second. - Reid: There aren't many fine people... - What he said is that the peaceful protest about taking down the monuments had fine people on both sides. Reid: If you're a fine person you wouldn't march alongside a neo-Nazi. Photographer: Thumbs up. Thank you very much. - Thank you. Thank you. - Photographer: Enjoy your stay. Kassam: Isn't that Britain in a nutshell? Spend the first six minutes on pro-Islam advocacy. You know, you've got the White House chief strategist here on the Brexit boom day. She starts by talking about Muslims. - Tank you so much. - Producer: Thank you so much. It was really a pleasure to meet you. - She's tough. - Producer: You think? I handle strong women - so well anyway, boom! - Oh, you did, you did. Yeah, you... you did. - Tell her I really appreciate that. - Very good job. - No, she's great. Yeah, yeah, I thought it was great. - Oh, okay. Kassam: Letting Steve Bannon talk some sense into shooting down Susanna. God, she was tough. I came off okay, I didn't come off as an asshole? Kassam: No, it was great. Look at this, look at... look at... look around you. This is the Edgware Road now, it's literally all Arab stores, - every single one. - Oh, wow. Beirut, yeah look at this. - Wow. - The whole thing. - What road is this right here? - Edgware Road. - Oh, yeah. - Yeah. When did this... when did this flip? (sighs) Ten years ago, really. - Wow. - This Al Rayan Bank - right here on the corner. - Yeah, yeah. Sharia financed banking. - Oh, God. - Yeah. Lewis: What I would really like to know is what your plan is for the next sort of six months. Bannon: Um, setting up a political apparatus. What I'm really focused on is the European parliamentary - elections in '19. - Right. We're gonna run the fucking tables on these guys. Lewis: It strikes me the European project you want to pull off is infinitely more complex than... than what you did in the US. 'Cause you've got all of these separate political environments, separate democracies, separate languages. - Bannon: It's not, it's not. - No? Bannon: You get a command by negation first. What they teach you in military and what they teach you at Goldman Sachs. Get a solid enough minority that's immovable. I'm not gonna get guys and convince them the state's bad. Let's win and take over the state, then you... then you gotta convince them, you gotta deconstruct that and get rid of it. That's what you... that gets you real... - that gets you real power. - Hmm. - I got to bounce. - Okay. So look, what's the best... - Sign this. - Tell me about the... you sure you want me to sign it? - Yeah. - (Lewis chuckles) I don't... I'm not the author. - I know that. - (Lewis chuckles) Um... It's a... it's a... this will go down as one of the important days. You reach the audience I gotta get to. 'Cause I'm gonna convert 20 percent of your guys. China. Persia or Iran. And Turkey. This is the new axis like the 1930s. God... Why is nobody talking about this? Why is only Steve Bannon talking about this? (protesters chanting) Male Reporter 1: President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania stepping off Air Force One at London's Stansted Airport. It was the start of a much anticipated visit to the UK. Male Reporter: President, perhaps you could elaborate on that remark that immigration has damaged the cultural fabric of Europe. I think it's been very bad for Europe. And I know it's politically not necessarily correct to say that, but I'll say it and I'll say it loud. And I think they'd better watch themselves because you are changing culture, you are changing a lot of things. You're changing security. You're... look at what's happening, I mean, you take a look. Bannon: Hey, guys. How you doing? - Riviere: Hey. - Bannon: Hey, how you doing? - Good to see you again. - Can we open these at all? - Kassam: No. - Why? - Kassam: It's on the street. - Oh, God. Between 18 and 25. It's gotta be all Macron's guys. - It can't be you. - No, it's us. The young one do vote for us. Bannon: Let me ask you, um, when they say change France, what changes are... were they looking for? Riviere: Gasoline prices are increasing drastically for the people that are living outside of cities. Bannon: Why are they increasing? Riviere: Because of taxes. He's putting additional taxes. - On... on gasoline? - Riviere: On gasoline. Argument he uses is the fact that, you know, gasoline is bad for the environment. Bannon: Where has he stood on the migrant crisis? 'Cause he didn't offer up, you guys closed your borders. You didn't take any of the migrant... Riviere: No we didn't close our borders. They... they went to Spain and we had some come from Spain. The key point is immigration. Bannon: You get... you want to go through the financials? Do you have those documents? - Riviere: We have it all here. - Bannon: Yeah. That two million, or two million Euro is what you pay in expenses for... for the month of July and August. Riviere: Anything else you need for this right now, or... Alison: Are you now like, consulting for the National Rally, uh, party? Or what... what did I just watch? Bannon: Every populist party or nationalist party that looks viable, right. I'm... I'm trying to help. This is what I've done for 40 years. This is no different than in the 1980s when I was at Goldman Sachs, sitting down with entrepreneurs and tech companies or media companies or in the 90s when I had my own firm. It's... it's literally just a different conference room, right. It's the same thing. - (chuckles) I don't know what it's used for. - (Farage chuckles) How do you set up something that begins a clearing... begins as a clearing house for ideas, which is a very gentle way to get people to get involved in it. They come for a chat, discussion, around the table, it's informal. Whatever. But can develop into something valuable. Modrikamen: Obviously there are different kinds of populists with different attack. But the main issue is clearly, migration, Islam. Depending on current trend with, uh, so called refugees and what we call chain migration, because we have a huge chain migration for one people getting in, uh, officially we have usually five or six following. Bannon: The birthrate of an Islamic couple in Belgium - versus a native Belgian... - Two or three times of... - Bannon: Two or three times. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. The real battle isn't in Washington or anywhere. The real battle is Brussels. This is where... this is where the future of all our states is gonna be determined. The more information you get to people, like the information that's laid today. It's like a contagion, it goes out. They may not put a flag in front of their house and say I'm voting for Trump. But they'll vote for Trump and they'll vote for you guys. It's just getting... it's coordinating, getting information out. - I think it's time for action. - Yes. Kassam: Would you mind taking a picture of all of us? Bannon: We have to have you in it. When they come for us they're coming for you too. (all laugh) Go ahead and jump in. I just wanna.. If anybody would like to say grace, feel free. - Jerome? - Ekeroth: No, I'm from a laic country so... Father, we're gathered around this table as friends and comrades. Kassam: At the moment when our American friends want to know who their allies are in the populist nationalist movement in... in Europe, well, there are several different places they call. There needs to be one place they can call. Yep. The only possibility to win the struggle for European identity, um... is to unify our... our parties. One thing you ought to give us is a punch list of just as a country what we can be doing to support, you know, this movement over here. You know, we do actually control the government. Bannon: Changed the fabric. You could find some kind of gimmick, something that... that would give us common, you know, common flag, or common, while respecting our national identities. Something that makes us focus on the fact that we're going to defeat the EU. Bannon: We're gonna use the media like Trump did. Kassam: Yeah. Mainstream media is gonna be our biggest ally, you watch. They're obsessed by us at the moment. - Bannon: Obsessed, obsessed. - We got to use that obsession, right, The Atlantic wrote a thousand word article today about like three meetings Steve took over the last few days, right. Here's the thing, even if they try to mock and deride it, the trust... the in the media is so low at the moment that people will go and go, hmm, yeah, I don't know, you know. Trump taught me a great lesson. There's no bad media. He... he, you know, and the more the mainstream media gets obsessed with this, it's gonna be your biggest... it's gonna be your biggest ally. Hey, how you doing brother? Can you just pop over there and then... Hey, how you doing, man? Kassam: This is Michael Jackson... Bannon: Yeah, this is all off the record. Yeah, the Front National guys were here. - Well, what did they want? - A lot of what we're talking about is very focused on, um, the European parliamentary elections in '19. I am starting to work with, uh, various parties, uh, throughout Europe and various individuals. Jason: Bannon: We're talking to people, we're telling them about the association. I mean, you got the big countries, Italy, Germany, France, Hungary obviously, Czech Republic. These leaders have done an amazing job. We're looking to provide, uh, polling, data analytics, war room messaging, surrogates. Man: It's the idea that with this, you know, we can become the official number one party in Italy, you know, like... and then... and then you have to tell them we have to plan. Plan is the key word. The victory, uh, for the European elections. - Mischael, from Belgium. - From the movement. Sean, pleasure to meet you. Modrikamen: The movement is in. - Man: Yeah, is in. - Is in. Modrikamen: And I asked clearly can we make it public. Man: Yeah. Bannon: Fine, go ahead and do it. Bannon: What I've learned, is you are part of a worldwide movement that is bigger than France, bigger than Italy. Interpreter: Do you allow photos with you? Yeah, sure, sure, sure. Oh, you do? Oh, you do? Well, he's one of my, uh, he's one of my heroes. (audience applauding) Bannon: Viktor Orban said the main task of our new government would be to preserve Hungary's security and its Christian culture. We are working on building an old school Christian democracy, rooted in the European tradition. (audience applauding) - Meloni: Finally. - Bannon: Hi. How are you doing? Well, I hope next year that, uh, we've initiated enough excitement that people by March or April, that this is what is in cafes, this is what people are talking about at dinner parties. Why is it every time that you talk about the demographic issue, and talk about family formation, and talk about young people trying to have families and trying to have jobs, you're a racist, you're a xenophobe, you're a nativist. They don't wanna discuss what the facts are. The deplorables in the United States, and the working men and women in England that voted for Brexit, and the Brothers of Italy and others that voted for change in Italy are raw political power. Man: Bannon: Italian Milo. That's loaded. That's loaded. Kassam: We're gonna take some questions now. You obviously have Steve Bannon right here. Giorgia Meloni. Mischael Modrikamen, cofounder of the movement. Bannon: I did this thing with The Daily Beast. That thing exploded. Literally 25 of the biggest news sites in the world picked it up as aggregation. And then it just metastasized. We have to live off earned media, right. We don't have enough money, this revolution we're trying to lead, we're not gonna have... we're never gonna be... we're not Soros, right. We're not gonna have 18 billion dollars to put in something. We're not the Kochs. And... and look, the President, he's the first to admit, he's a huge consumer of media. You know, if you're... if you're in The New York Times, he's gonna read it, right. If you're on CNN or Fox, he's gonna watch it. - Did we get the trailer? - Fleuette: Yeah. Can I see the new trailer 'cause I got to send this... - Fleuette: Yeah. - Huh? Fleuette: Yeah, I'm... I'm looking at it right now. Fine. Just see it and then let me see it and I got to get that to Maggie. Trump: You know, this is tough stuff. We're fighting a war. Coming September. Doom, boom, lock it. Let me have it right now, I'm gonna send it to Maggie. Alison: Are you giving it to The Times? Bannon: New York Times, yeah. The opposition party. The paper of record for our country. We're not gonna put this in theaters, this is to go out to rallies, all that type of stuff. - It's an hour long? - Yeah. - Oh, wow. - Yeah. It's a real film. - Wow. - Let's not mince words. Donald Trump is a bigot and a racist. I'm sorry, he's a racist. Male Reporter: He's a belligerent, loud mouthed racist. His supporters, what does it say about you, that no matter what, you continue to make excuses for this man for his vile behavior? Bannon: Look, I've said from day one, people are really thinking about making race and identity politics the centerpiece of the democratic primaries. If they do that, we'll win. It's just... people are... 'cause people... it's economic nationalism. They care about jobs. Alison: But all I'm saying is, like you're making deplorables the identity that you're rallying people around. Like you're showing them them being attacked and saying that they should be outraged at how people are talking about them. Right? And your point? (chuckles) Trump: When did we beat Japan at anything? When did we beat Mexico at the border? They're laughing at us, at our stupidity. The US has become a dumping ground... for everybody else's problems. We're fighting a war. Alison: Outrage culture, identity politics, that's like what you're leaning into. Come on, then that would... that would mean, like, it's propaganda. What would Leni Riefenstahl do? How should we... how should we... how should we... how would Leni cut that scene? Oh, well. I don't think there's been a midterm election this important, uh, in my lifetime, uh, because the democrats want to take us back to taxes and to the regulatory states... Bannon: Now, okay, so here's what's going to happen. On September 9th, I'm gonna premiere this up at Harry Ciprianis, exactly two years to the day she gave the deplorables speech. You're one of the keynote speakers. Beautiful. Bannon: The exact moment that she went on the stage two years ago... the curtain comes up on Trump @War. - It's a beautiful thing. - My, uh... Bannon: I love fucking with her like this. Uh, well, nothing like... Wait a minute, this is on camera so I'll be careful. Melber: Hey. Hey, New York, if you called me I... I can't pick it up I'm shooting... Melber: Copy that. Let's start with the midterms. If they were held today, who do you think would win the house? I think if they were held today, uh, we'd have a tough time holding the house. Melber: You have a new group. Is that because you think Republicans are on pace to lose and they need your help? I think, look, our group is principally to... to do the undergirding of President Trump's populism and economic nationalism message. Who is funding this group? Well, it's just... it's private donors. Melber: Why not tell people who they are? Well, because I think the donors want to be private. - It's... it's the law... - Melber: The law allows them - to go public or private. - By the way, if they want to come forward, if donors want to come forward, - they can come forward. - Is there anyone you would not take money from? Well, I would not take money from foreigners, right. And there are certain people... You know, I'm pretty selective about, you know, who I take money from. I... I've always had good partners. Always had partners I've been pretty happy with. Kwok: Hi, sir. (chuckles) - Hi, sir. Welcome. - Bannon: Hey, how are you? (chuckles) Come here. Bannon: Yeah, can you and I spend a little, uh... Kwok: Yeah. Kwok: Great. Could... could you give her a little tour of your house? (talking in Chinese) Male Reporter 1: Guo Wengui originally made his money in real estate. You like this room, the color? Male Reporter 1: He fled China in 2015 after his relationship with the Chinese Communist Party officials, soured. Male Reporter 2: The Chinese government accuses Guo of bribery fraud, and money laundering but it doesn't have an extradition treaty with the US. Male Reporter: He's also a member of Donald Trump's - exclusive Mar-a-Lago club. - Snow, Snow, watch. Good. Can we go ahead and... and... I'll catch up with you later? 'Cause I've got to do something. - Alison: Yeah. - Anything else you wanna get from Miles while you're here? No, Miles Kwok is a... is a... like a... he's like a... he's a figure from a movie. Alison: Did Miles support the film? Trump @War? - Did who? - Alison: Miles. What do you mean support? - Alison: Like financially. - Oh, no, no, no. Never take any money from him. Bannon: There's two places in the world that World War III could start. And that's the Persian Gulf and the South China Sea. We gotta be very careful. You're playing with matches over there. Here... what we're gonna be presenting late in the month, this is actually the 2018 not 2008. The, um, this walks through why the Chinese... China is just a ponzi scheme. In the run up to the 19th party congress where President Xi was just laying out the 2049 and everything like that. Two people... were telling me what was gonna happen and who were gonna be the key guys afterwards of all the other writing out there. And that was Miles Kwok and John Thornton. And they absolutely had it to a tee. They said Wang Qishan and Liu He are gonna be his two principle deputies. Wang Qishan is coming to Saudi Arabia... - Alison: Wang "Chi"shan. - Wang Qishan. Alison: "Chi." The Q is pronounced "Chi." - "Shi" - Alison: Yeah, "Chi." "Shi"? I can pronounce Wang Qishan. It's what... how do you say it? - Alison: "Chi"shan. - "Shi"shan. He's Wang Qishan but it's "Shi"shan? - Alison: "Chi" - Wang "Shi"shan. Alison: Yeah. You know anybody who pronounces it like that? Alison: About a billion or so... Oh, no, I'm not talking about the people in China. Thornton calls it Qishan. Wang Qishan. I'm gonna get John... I'm gonna tell... I'm gonna ask John Thornton tonight. Alison: Okay. I'm not worried about it. Okay, okay. (band music playing) (indistinct chatter) Modrikamen: We need a website. - Okay. - Bannon: Yeah. Look, website I think, it has to be the simplest possible. These are not nearly classic enough. I want something really classic that represents kinda Europe. Can I get, uh, Raheem on the phone? - Yeah? - Yeah. Steve is asking what's going on. What... what do we do? And by the way, Raheem, I don't have the time to do this, so if it's like I'm getting in to micromanaging, I'm now getting into micromanaging. I need the lawyer to define for me what every paragraph is, and why this has to go in there. - Okay? - Kassam: Okay. And I need that done today. Kassam: Well, hold on, one second you're saying you don't want to micromanage the next second... No, I am micromanaging now 'cause I need to get this shit done. They may propose building a website that sucks in seven million guys, right. I have no idea. Kassam: You and I had an email exchange last week where you said get Andy on it, so he's already on it. Where do we stand? Kassam: Well, I texted him yesterday, I didn't get a response. (sighs) Do you want me to come and wipe... do I have to change your nappy and powder your bottom. Kassam: I can't... what am I gonna do, - text him every hour? - Yes. Kassam: Okay, fine. Raheem, do you have this budget in front of you? Kassam: I have to find it, hold on. - Um, that's upstairs. - (scoffs) Let's see... Raheem, we're gonna call you back in a second, okay? Okay, look. I went through this with Breitbart London. This is why I can't do this with him anymore. It just... all he wants to do is go on fucking TV, and be a big shot, and do all that, and this is what... the success of this is all in here. - God is in the details. - Exactly. Bannon: Nigel's got the same problem Raheem does. All these... all these British guys, they just wanna fuck off all the time. Nobody wants to do any work. - Hey. How was it? - The, uh... dude. Bannon: Your life's about to change here, right here, stop. Here's what's gonna happen. - You're now... - You have 50 million dollars - for me? - Bannon: No, uh, it's worse. - That I can earn. - No, you could. But you're gonna... you're now... I'm not kidding you, you're in charge of the European project. I can't do Raheem anymore. He... he reports to you. You saw the email. I just got off a call with him, he hasn't done anything. He hasn't done shit. He's blowing... he's taking our money, he sends expenses and he hasn't done anything. You shouldn't do any work. All you have to do, is say, "Raheem, where is this, where is this." Every day I want to know what Raheem does. 'Cause right now he's just fucking off. He's hanging out over at Morton's, smoking cigars, drinking, being a big shot, right. Even though I'm 64, I realize that every day I'm burning daylight. That stuff has got to get done. People do come in at certain moments and it changes. If I had not come in as the CEO of the campaign, Trump would not have won. There's no doubt. No doubt in my mind, no doubt in his mind. Donald Trump is a historical figure and Donald Trump's a transformational president. And Donald Trump's gonna be in your life, your personal life, 30 years from now. Alison: So, you're sacrificing your personal life right now for that? No, but it's not... it's... You know, what is a personal life? You know, all my life, I'd had, you know, dedicated to the job. I was a workaholic and, you know, I read history and I followed politics and I did things... of course, I had outside activities and... and golf and things like that but it's not... as you get older, I mean, this... this life is so fulfilling for me and I'm so busy, I can't think about other stuff. And I look at it and it's like, what else would I be doing? Um... I'm sure you have... lots of experience putting these things on. Not really, is that good? Is that why you wear two shirts, one for each camera. Exactly. - (whistles) - More up here. - Have you seen Trump @War? - Your film. I should say yes now but I haven't so... Well, no I sent... I'm gonna send you a link tonight. - Okay. - This is not a persuasion film. It's a, uh, it's a... it's a piece of propaganda, right. I... I consider propaganda to be positive but... Errol Morris says, and with... with respect to you, "The permission to hate seems to be a really big part of what Steve Bannon offered to voters. Hate black people, hate Hispanics, hate Muslims, hate, hate, hate. Hate is energizing for a lot of people." That was his interpretation of you after spending a lot of time with you. You have to watch the film and see that. I don't think that's true at all. Some of the people you're doing business with here in Europe are far right, sometimes quite extreme, sometimes they've got links to... - Like Orban? Or who? - Lewis: Like Filip Dewinter who you had a meeting with in... in London. Bannon: No, no, he just came to... he just came... that was a general dinner. Lewis: Does it concern you that Filip Dewinter has like commemorated former SS collaborators... Bannon: No, no, no, I said, that kind of stuff is not gonna be tolerated in the... in the movement. We were very upfront with that, right. So he just came... he just came to the dinner. That was a general dinner. We had, you know, a number of people there. Lewis: What about Kent Ekeroth in Sweden? I mean, he has been ostracized by the Sweden Democrats. He's not even on their list of parliamentary candidates. Bannon: He came to the introductory dinner too. Lewis: He was the other person at the dinner. Bannon: Yeah. I mean, there's like 15 or 20 people at dinner. I mean, people will find it deeply offensive, particularly Jews who live in Europe. Jews who lived in... Jews who lived in Italy. Bannon: Hang on, Mischael happens to be Jewish. Mischael's Jewish. Lewis: Let me just say what Errol Morris said. He said Steve Bannon will doubtlessly say... say that his remarks were not anti-Semitic but I would respectfully disagree. He knew what he was doing. He's suggesting that you're doing dog whistle anti-Semitism here. That... that's your modus operandi. I just disagree with, um, with Errol on that. - Lewis: Is the term globalist an anti-Semitic slur? - Absolutely not. Lewis: Coded anti-Semitic slur. I mean, there are people who would argue that it is. George Soros, I mean that is widely accepted as an anti-Semitic trope. The use... the suggestion that George Soros is somehow all controlling, that he's influencing Europe, everybody knows... I totally disagree with that. - George Soros is the biggest... - Lewis: That's a fact. It's not something to disagree with because it is an anti-Semitic trope. What no, George, that's... just cause you stated it, - doesn't mean it's true. - Lewis: The idea that George Soros is controlling the world. I didn't say controlling the world, I said he's the... he's the financier in back of the NGOs. So you're unaware that many people will read that as being a nod and a wink toward anti-Semitism? Bannon: Absolutely not. I don't see that at all. Experts in Italy will... will connect the success of the Italian far right and say it's connected to a really alarming resurgence of neo-fascism in Italy right now. And that has been... - That doesn't exist. - I don't think... - What doesn't exist? - They build all this story about the... the fascism was coming back, so it would alarm people so they were voting for the left. You know what you should come in Italy and then look at what we are doing everyday. Lewis: Okay, let me ask about your party secretary, Francesco Minutillo. He had a manifest objection to Islamic people. He said, uh, Adolf Hitler was his uncle and, uh, that fascism was, quote, the best period in Italian history. Meloni: It can be that you have got somebody that says something you don't agree. You... you, uh, maybe... maybe we change them. Interpreter: This is not... this is not right. You're an interpreter not an interviewee, so if you don't mind. I will give you after my opinion. We don't... we're not interested in your opinion right now. Bannon: Oh, hang on, hang on, don't be so rude to this guy. You don't have permission to come out being rude to him. - Interpreter: I'm only... - (Overlap chattering) Your way of interviewing is fascist. Sir, with respect, your way of translating is highly ineffective. We're having a conversation. If you wouldn't mind, I would like to continue. Giorgia, you said your party was not neo-fascist. Steve, when you told me you were gonna meet Giorgia, you described Brothers of Italy as a neo-fascist party. - Bannon: I don't think I did. - You did. Twice. - I don't think I did. - So, I just wonder who's right. Are they... Is it not a neo-fascist party or it is? 'Cause that's what you said to me. I don't think I did at all. You can't possibly believe those are dog whistles. - Lewis: Hmm? - You can't possibly believe - those are dog whistles. - Do you know, I think you, um, I genuinely don't think you could not believe - that they are. - Oh, my God. Come on. And I... I don't sort of think it's the trivial, sort of, joking thing and you do this sort of smirk and it's sort of uncomfortable for me 'cause it's serious. Oh, but I think... It's serious offensive dog whistle politics. - Oh, my... I think... - I think you know it, Steve. No, I think you're totally wrong on that. You know you're wrong. But we can talk about it. (bell tolling) Male Reporter 1: Steve Bannon will no longer be attending this year's New Yorker festival. Male Reporter 2: Bannon was disinvited from the New Yorker festival. Male Reporter 3: Following criticism from other guests. Following backlash on social media. Male Reporter 4: Given what Steve Bannon represents which is the rise of white nationalism, I think it's overall a generally good thing that platform is taken away. (bell tolling) Female Reporter 1: In a stunning and unprecedented move The New York Times is publishing a shocking, anonymous, op-ed from a senior Trump administration official. Male Reporter 1: Quote, "We believe our first duty is to this country and the President continues to act in a manner that is detrimental to the health of our republic." Bannon: We've had a coup d'état in the United States. That letter yesterday, that op-ed in The New York Times, is from the Republican establishment and they've basically said you're not acceptable. Now they realize Trump's a danger to the system. Bannon: It's a team of people. It's, um, Huntsman, Brian Hook, Dan Coats, Linda Chao, Brenberg, Mulvaney, it's... it's a whole pack of them. This midterm election, the instrument of Trump's destruction is going to be the House of Representatives and they've deemed that they don't mind losing 40 seats. People are looking at this the wrong way. It's not a battlefield map with 40 or 50 seats. There are 20 that are done, fuck 'em. No more money, you cut it off. The incremental 15, on November 6 in the evening, we have to guarantee to ourselves that we can hold and win these. That's all that matters. If we do that, he's gonna not get impeached. Event Attendee: Who's our special guest gonna be? Alison: Do you want me to ruin the surprise? - Oh, yeah. - Alison: 'Cause I know. - Tell me. - Alison: Steve Bannon. Event Attendee: (gasps) No. Oh, my God. - I'm so excited. - Bill Bannon? Steve Bannon. - Oh, Steve. - I love him. - Alison: Are you really excited? - Oh, my God. - I'm so excited. Thank you. - Allison: (chuckles) The movie just did a really good job of showing where things started two years ago and where they are now. - Really, okay. - So... Woman: You know, and he hasn't paid any attention to what he's really done. And when he got up he said, "Okay. That was a no propaganda, factual," you know, "I see what's happened," so... - Okay. Cool. - I see what's happened. - That's real good to hear. - Yeah. Man: This guy I'm about to introduce, he embodies the term populist nationalist. And he's someone who had an unbelievable influence on Donald Trump from day one. And now I'm gonna introduce, Mr. Steve Bannon. (crowd cheers and applauds) Bannon: Thank you so much, thank you. I think it's the 6th event I've done today or gathering. Every room I'm in, it's the exact same crowd, right? It's the deplorables. It's the backbone of our victory in, uh, in 2016. This midterm that's gonna happen on November 6, is just not any midterm. It is Donald J Trump's first reelect. I have said from day one, it was divine providence. I was there. It was divine providence that delivered that. Divine providence. But divine providence works through human agency. Divine providence works through people knocking on doors, making phone calls. It's about human action. You have to engage. You have to engage because the other side's engaged. These young kids that have been out in June, July and August on the progressive left, they've been walking precincts. The Time's Up movement, and the resistance, and Tom Steyer's next generation, walking precincts and ringing doorbells. It's the French Revolution. That's what's coming. We're either gonna be the country that was bequeathed to us or we're gonna be something radically different. - (music playing) - (audience applauding) Get in the middle, a rose between two thorns. One, two, three. - Bannon: Let's get her... - Woman: In the middle? I see two thorns. (music continues playing) Band Member: Woman: Made you a card - and I wrote you a poem. - Bannon: Oh, my gosh. Wow. I haven't had that happen in a long time. "I dream of fallen patriots past. I can see my future clearly cast. The fields of amber, so red, white and blue, the fight brings my passion so strongly to protect you. America, so forgotten, your gratitude so due. I find my every fiber calling out to you. - I remember and I am true." - Bannon: Wow. - Thank you so much. - Woman: Here's the poem. Oh, thank you. Thank you so much. That's amazing. If you walked in my grandmother's house, the front room is just like this, right. Same type of neighborhood. Same crosses, crucifix, family. You know, I just got back from Europe, right before I started the campaign here and, you know, in Italy and in France and in Germany, it's all the same folks, right, working class, middle class people. Sean: Bannon: Oh you, come on dude. - It drives me crazy. - Bannon: I love that. - I could be there every day. - That stuff drives me crazy. Bannon: Oh, my God. I love her. (indistinct chatter) Alison: Can you explain where we are right now? This is the Van Nuys private airport. This is the populist... - Sean: Headquarters. - That is so bad. I'm gonna get so crushed... I'm gonna get so crushed in this film! She got every five star hotel. (plane engine roars) Nunberg: The wall. - The wall was my idea. - You started working when? - Twelve or what? - And that's a fact. That's a fact. I don't care what Trump says. Alison: So how did you come up with it? He's a genius. Well, immigration was our threshold issue. Immigration was going to be our birtherism issue. Immigration was from a political issue. So, we were gonna do mass deportation and the wall. And the wall fit with his brand. And it was simplistic and it was easy for everyone to understand. I did get Trump onto Twitter too. Bannon: You're the one that got Trump on Twitter? Yeah. We became friends... - Friendly... - Became friends. Not friends. I mean we became... we started dealing with each other a lot. Became friends. Yeah, you're buddies. When you're at that level you don't... you don't have friends among grundoons. That's the problem. Guys like you and Cory and Stone, you all think you're buddies with him. You're not. Alison: And you're not either? Not what? Friend of Trump? No. Never. The pressure he's under, he doesn't need... people crowding his space. (audience laughs) I don't care if the guy likes me. I don't care... No, seriously. Here's what I know. Last night on national TV, he called himself a nationalist that was against the globalists. Okay. I'm about one thing. I'm about winning. A globalist is a person that wants the globe to do well, frankly, not caring about our country so much. And you know what, we can't have that. You know, they have a word. It sort of became old-fashioned, it's called a nationalist. And I say, "Really? We're not supposed to use that word." You know what I am? I'm a nationalist, okay? I'm a nationalist. Male Reporter 1: Trump referred to himself as a nationalist, a term embraced by those with a racist ideology. Male Reporter 2: He galvanizes his space and he instinctively knows it will turn out more voters for him come the Midterm Elections. You can tell a man by his enemies. The Pope, President Xi in China, George Soros... I'm just kidding. Any other questions... Male Reporter 1: Trump has continued to stoke conspiracies about billionaire Liberal dono, George Soros, who is Jewish. Female Anchor: Well, who do you think is behind these caravans? A lot of speculation that it's George Soros, do you believe that? I do not. I am not a conspiracy theorist. I am so upset that George Soros funds all of these creative activists and I can't... or other people like me, can't find a George Soros on the right side of the fence. Woman: Hate is a motivator. Anger is a motivator. I know. I was part of the Tea Party. The anger motivates. You are not under any obligation, to let these people enter your country. They just shouldn't fucking be here. President is firing up his base with the issue that helped propel him into the White House. Bannon: People are saying, you know, George Soros is paying for it, the Left's paying for it. You can tell the democrats, George Soros, and the angry mob that's coming here, you either come the right way like everyone else or be ready to face the militay and a one-way ticket back to where you came from. Male Reporter 1: The US Secret Service has intercepted suspicious packages... Female Reporter 1: The device sent to the New York home of billionaire democratic dono, George Soros... Male Reporter 2: ...as well as the homes of the former Presidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama this morning. - Alison: Did you guys up the security at all today? - Fleuette: Yes. Yeah, we did. Alison: Did it make you nervous, the bomb stuff? - I got like a million texts. - Fleuette: (clears throat) Um, well first of all, I don't know that they're even real. So, I'll have to wait and see. They seem to all be targeting lefties which is... Seems kind of odd to me. Alison: 'Cause you think people would target left and right indiscriminately? Fleuette: No, because I think, uh, lefties are usually more the violent type. Weather Underground, you know, Black Panthers. Traditionally, it's been... Expect for maybe, uh... Timothy McVeigh. But he was just crazy. He would... I wouldn't call him one of us. Male Reporter 1: A person by the name of Cesar Sayoc Jr. has been arrested in connection with this, uh, bomb probe. Male Reporter 2: This van where we now know Cesar Sayoc was living. It was adorned with stickers and posters supporting President Trump and Vice President Pence and democratic opponents with targets over their faces. Male Reporter 3: At least 11 people were killed when a gunmen opened fire in the Tree of Life synagogue. - Woman: Oh, you want me in the middle. - A... a rose - between two thorns. - Woman: Oh, there you go. Come on. Come on. Okay? Okay. Thank you. (indistinct chatter) Female Reporter 1: This mass shooting come to the end of a week of bomb scares targeting democratic political leaders and Trump critics across the country. Male Reporter 4: We are learning more about the synagogue massacre in Pittsburgh. Sadly, the number of victims has increased. The Anti-Defamation League saying this is likely the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the US. Rabbi: Seven of my congregants were shot dead in my sanctuary. It has to start with you as our leaders. Words of hate are unwelcome in Pittsburgh. (crowd cheering and applauding) Bannon: How's this for the... the... for The Times. They're doing a thing on Soros being, you know, attacked and vilified. Quote, "Soros has without a doubt been the single most important, powerful and effective individual driving the globalist agenda on the world stage," Mr. Bannon said. "Soros is vilified because he is effective. I only hope one day I am as effective as he has been and as vilified," Mr. Bannon said, calling threats like the pipe bombs, quote, "The admission ticket for playing in this arena." It's not anti-Semitic. Globalist is not anti-Semitic. Would you please stop? Alison: It seems like a lot of people agree with me. I don't... A lot of lefties. Alison: And the people shooting up synagogues and sending pipe bombs. It's not anti-Semitic. It's a term. It's the party of Davos. (indistinct chatter) Protesters: Shame on you! Shame on you! Shame on you! Shame on you! Shame on you! ♪ You stupid ass bitch! I ain't fucking with you! ♪ (protesters cheering) Man: So, so, so. This whole thing about hate. Trump's economic nationalism doesn't care about your race, your religion, your ethnicity, your color. (audience laughing) Okay. Okay. I got a whole night to convert you. (audience laughs) If the Trump program and the populist is so bad, David, how do we get the new NAFTA deal? And the key to the NAFTA deal... (audience booing) - I forgot I'm in Toronto. - (audience laughing) President Trump is a crook. Viktor Orban is a crook. Marine Le Pen is a crook. Orban is winning with 70 percent of the vote. Di Maio and Salvini are winning with two thirds of the vote. Bolsonaro, Captain Bolsonaro wins with 55 percent of the vote. Donald Trump wins with over 300 electoral votes. (audience laughing and applauding) Tough, tough. Deplorables, it's all on their shoulders. It's their kids and their money. And it's come time that we're not looking to be an empire, we're not an imperial power, we're a revolutionary power. Man: - If the suggestion... If... - Thanks, Mom. (audience laughing) Thornton: So, what'd you think? - Bannon: Why don't you tell me what you thought. - I thought it was great. Yeah, you know, everyone. Were you sitting there? Did you see it? That line with the mother was great. - (Bannon chuckles) - They loved that. But even before that, you know, stay with me here, - You know, that kind of stuff. - (chuckles) Yeah. For people who don't know you, you're totally disarming because you're sort of charming and, kind of, you pick up irony and you're... They... they're kind of shocked you're such a nice, quote, a nice guy. The hatred of Trump is like something I never seen before. That's the first time I've faced it with a crowd of decent people. Those are not screaming liberals. - Right. - Right? - Those are decent folks. - Right. - They hate him. - That's why I keep saying to you it's sort of a parallel track here, right. One is, you're the guy who put him... put him in the White House. That's all good, however, you're the leader of something that's much more powerful. Whether he runs in 2020 or he doesn't run in 2020. Or 2024 for that matter. So... So I'd like to see what ha... I'd like to see you increasingly seen as the intellectual horsepower leading the movement. Uh, which gives you independent standing. Which is why this kind of crowd... - Bannon: Yes. - ...is good for you. Bannon: Yes. I got to do more of this. Yeah. You know, Bernie Sanders people and all that stuff. The... the blacks, the Hispanics, and all that. - We're gonna get those guys. - Thornton: Yeah, we don't... Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely - What are you doing Tuesday? - Thornton: Um, I'm around. Bannon: You ought to come down and we're gonna set up, um, a war room type thing, - you come down and watch the results. - Thornton: In D.C.? - Bannon: Yeah. On a rooftop over on the Capitol. - Thornton: Oh, cool. Bannon: Drop the fucking call and get on this conference call. You got to run this, dude. I can't run it. I got to go other places. You got... drop fucking Ben now and get on this call. God damn it. Okay. Standby one second, Sam's gonna join us momentarily. Larry, this is very important. Because Larry, your analysis of actual voting is different than the polling. - And it's driving us to a different conclusion, okay. - Pat: Yup. Bannon: How many absolute votes have already been cast is like 3.9 million. Pat: Yeah, it is with national. Not national. Not national, Pat. Pat, I'm talking about Florida. Please stay focused. - Pat: Oh, I'm sorry. - Just stay focused, okay! I want to fucking go through these states. I don't give a fuck about a national number. - Go back to Florida, how many votes have been ca... - Man: Just the... Will you shut the... will you shut the fuck up and let the guy talk? Pat: Um, oh, okay, so far, - it's 41.7 percent of Republicans... - (sighs) Yeah. I know this... I know this, but she's a... she's a tough closer. What... what... but what numbers are you looking at there? Alison: Are you basically comparing everything to how it felt in 2016? Yeah, but just that... that really it's all the... it's analytics. I got the same team we had in '16. They're much more optimistic than I am now. It's just something about... I had a great feeling in '16, I knew we had it. I was... I never doubted a second. Uh, boom, here's what we gotta do. And all the numbers started coming in. I don't have that feeling this time. I just don't have the feeling. Something's bugging me. Alison: Two years ago this was your job because you were running Trump's campaign. - Yeah. - Alison: Now, why is it - personally meaningful to you? - 'Cause it's the... it's the populist movement. If we lose tomorrow, the House, it's gonna take, you know, it's gonna take a big hit. It's gonna take, you know, we're gonna have to get it back up and grind it back again. You're gonna be... it's gonna be stopped. First off, you're not gonna get a border wall. They control appropriations. Border wall's done. Not gonna get it. Alison: And that's key for the pop... - for your populist movement? - I think the border wall is key for the whole Trump presidency. There's so many things, the whole appropriation of stuff is controlled by the Democrats. In this town, all these committees don't mean shit. The appropria... the appropriations process in the House of Representatives is everything. (sighs) Wow. Male Reporter 1: Election day is finally here and millions of Americans are already lined up to cast their votes in what party leaders are calling the most important midterm election of our lifetimes. Today's election will decide who will take control of the Congress, of course, and set the stage for the next two years of the Trump presidency. Right now Republicans leads the House of Representatives 240 seats to 195, but if Democrats can add at least 23 seats today, they will take control. Bannon: Hey, hey! It's not exactly CNN but... Cortes: No, it's a cool view though. - Better people. - Yeah. - Annie, you know Steve Cortes? - Oh, hi. Nice to see you. - Michael Wolff, Steve Cortes. - Yeah, I've been on TV with you. - Cortes: Oh, okay. Good to see you. - Yeah. Good to see you. - How you doing? - You miss us? - It's going to be fun, no? - Yeah. (indistinct chatter) I'm so glad you're here. Scheuermann: If you're winning anyway in France, why do you need Bannon? (chuckles) He's coming with a good track record and he's saying look if you want some, whatever I can bring positivity, I'm willing to... to be at your disposal, - so we'd be silly to refuse. - Scheuermann: Oh. Oh. Oh. (indistinct chatter) It's... it's quite discrete in the way he helps. He's just, you know, I have these tools, do you want them, you don't want them. (indistinct chatter) Bannon: Look, it's a mix of good news and bad news. The McSally thing I thought was really breaking her way. Looks like it didn't happen. I think McSally and Heller could both be in trouble. This is your fucking job, I need you to get... When he says that, get this up and get it over there, dude. Don't give it to me. Okay, Larry, I'll call you later, thank you. Engage your fucking brain. - Male Reporter 1: We have serious breaking news. - (crowd cheering) Democrats are continuing to win. It is the end of one party rule in the United States. Thank God. And the beginning of a new democratic party. Younger, browner, cooler, more women, more veterans. Can win in Michigan. Can win in Pennsylvania. Can win in Ohio. Michigan was a loss tonight. I mean we held some of the seats we gotta hold but, James is a loss, Epstein's a loss. If you can't win with those people - we're doing something wrong. - Man: ...that we need it. What if the Democrats have a two-seat majority. They're gonna run it like they have a 30 seat majority. - I know they will. - They don't care. Bannon: So I mean, it has no... it has no bearing. - I wanna explain... I wanna explain something to you. - Bannon: No, no, no... no whining, no tears. They... they take the gavel, they got subpoena power, they got it. - It's a bad night. - Fritsch: It is. It's a bad night for the President? Bannon: Yeah. You lose the appropriations process, and you give them investigative authority. I mean, you can't... you can't say that that's... Nunberg: Right, yeah, no, I know. This town's gonna be very different. Ayanna: None of us ran to make history. We ran to make change. We have affirmed that while this could go down as the darkest time in our history, - we won't let it be. - (crowd cheering) Lifting up and affirming what we are for. Woman: For an America that young people can still have their American dream fulfilled. - Woman 2: Universal childcare. - Woman 3: Equity. - Woman 4: Moral clarity. - Woman 3: Justice. Woman 5: To prioritize humane immigration and criminal justice system. Woman 6: Protect women's right to choose. - Woman 7: That is what we are fighting for. - (crowd cheering) Bannon: This can't be hugged out. We win some and we lose more. But we continue to fight. If you focus on the handful of messages people don't care about anything else. What they're fighting for is their country. If they know that you're fighting to save their country and to make the country great again, they don't care about anything else. To get what I need done, I don't need to be a politician, right. Don't need to be. I'm just amazed at the... this is a global revolution and, you know, I'm very lucky to be at the vanguard of it. And it's something, you know, worth dedicating your life to.
