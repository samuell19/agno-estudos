YOUR FRIEND LUIGI HAS DIED, I'M SORRY! P.S. I TOOK THE CAR Do you think there is any hope for the world? No. EARS Do you read the Bible, Mr. Spina? No, actually I'm not Mr. Spina. - Do you read the Bible? - I've just woken up. There's a ringing in my ear, I don't feel all that good... Everything is the work of God. - Haven't you ever noticed it? - It's also written in the Bible. There are hundreds of books that say otherwise. The Bible is a sacred book. Written by people inspired by God. - And who says so? - It's written in the Bible. - That's called a paralogism. - What? Good morning. - Good morning. - There! I'm sorry that when you knocked on my door I didn't open it. Don't worry about it, madam. It's just that my husband died in April. A collapsed lung, poor Fausto. Since then I've really had nothing to say to people like you. The Lord gives and the Lord takes away. I didn't mean to interrupt anything. I'm sorry. Carry on. No, no, the ladies... the sisters were just leaving... You do remember Fausto, don't you? I may have bumped into him a few times. This is really where Miss Spina, my girlfriend, lives. I only come here occasionally. - I suppose you know how to make coffee? - What... coffee? What the... And this one is my brother-in-law's house that you've seen from the other side. Here's Fausto wearing that tank-top that I bought for him in Capri, for his birthday. - Why don't you get married? - When I changed his catheter... - Who to? - To your girlfriend. Children need a proper father and mother. - What children? - ...in '59. You weren't even born yet. There wasn't even the hydrofoil in those days. And so to distract him I told him about our trip in the taxi from the train station of Naples to the port. There were lots of seagulls there. I used to tell him about this journey... You can tell that she isn't happy. ...and I could stick that catheter into his... What? She isn't happy. It's obvious. Look at the corners of her mouth. No, she isn't happy. And what do we have left of it all? Just our memories. When we got to the island we looked for a swimming costume with seagulls on it. - I'm so terribly sorry! - We need something to clean it up. We'll clean it all up right away. Have you got any more napkins? Sorry madam... You see? Everything seems to be alright. Nothing here... It's clean, you see? Like new. - Here are the napkins. - Look here, madam. Oh my God, madam! What are you doing? Please, madam, stop it! Oh my God! Oh my God! ...two, three: go. If you want to accompany your mother, Mr Spina, follow the ambulance with your car. Actually she isn't my mother, and I'm not Mr Spina. I haven't even got the car today. Hello? Hi. Hello... Hello? Yes... What's up? You know the lady in the apartment opposite yours? Mrs. Torrini? Have you seen her today? She's nice, isn't she? Something strange has happened. I'll tell you about it later. Please, can you take the laundry out of the washing machine? - OK. - Otherwise it will smell bad. Are you sure you're all right? It's probably nothing but I woke up with... a kind of ringing sound. A ringing sound? In my ears. Maybe you should see a doctor about it. Have you read the message? What message? The one about your friend Luigi who has died. I'm sorry. Your phone was ringing and I answered it. I'm sorry. Do you mind? No, no problem... The funeral is at 7pm today. The address is on the back of the note. Will you be sleeping at my place again tonight? I've got a lot of stuff to do. I'll go back to my house, but thank you... As you wish. What time do you have your job interview? Half past three. Good luck with it. My first patient has just arrived. I have to go now. Call me. Bye. Bye. E.R. A what? An audiologist. An ear doctor. I have a problem... They look normal to me. I can hear a sort of ringing noise. I can't hear anything. I need an audiologist. Let's see. What we've got here... Ophthalmologist, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon, Orthopedic Surgeon, Obstetrician, Otolaryngologist... - That one! - Obstetrician? - No. Otolaryngologist. - Are you sure? Yes, the ear doctor. So you meant "otolaryngologist". Audiologist doesn't mean anything. White. What... You are code white. Red means "really sick". Yellow means "just sick". Green means "so-so". You're white. No emergency. Have you ever been to the E.R.? Do you think I'd have to come here if I was OK? I can't believe this! This is the form. Fill it out. - I need a pen. - Oh My... Don't fill in the bottom part, I'll have to do that. Everyone gets it wrong. If you are code white... how long does it take? One hour, two hours, five...? Oh no, it won't take hours. It takes much longer. And what if I have a... private treatment? "A private treatment" doesn't mean anything. Private practice. A consultation as a private patient? Then that will be 125,25 Euros. Yes? Hello. I'm sorry, but... I seem to be having a problem... Sorry. What? Could you please repeat that? ...bank card. It's not... My bank card is already inside the ATM. You must insert... then pull out... ...evade. I don't understand. First you need... so as to... I don't understand. Can you... He can't hear me. I can hear you now. Oh, OK. I was talking, but I thought you couldn't hear me. Wait a moment. Insert... amount desired. Please try again. No... What the fuck! Fuck it! Fuck you! Junn... Yes, it's me. You know the arrears that you still owe me? Yes, for four weeks of lessons... Do you mind if I drop by to get the cash? Hello, sir. Hi. Is everything alright, sir? Yes, more or less. You sure? Yes, Junn. Let me get the money I owe you. I've finished my essay. - Can I give it to you on Friday though? - Alright. So, how's it going at school? Same as usual. Still working as a substitute teacher, are you? Yeah. And how's the new album coming on? I have some new ideas. I want to make a concept album... about "Kammus". But why about... Camus? I'm tired of making music just for kids. You are a kid, Junn. It's right for you to make music for kids. My name's Philippo. "Junn" was my name at school. I've stopped coming to school. - Sure. - Now I can afford a private teacher. He too had a degree in philosophy. I know. Why did you choose that book? - Have you read it? - Of course. This guy... goes walking along a beach, and suddenly, for no apparent reason, he shoots an Arab and kills him. Do you know why? Because of the malaise of living. That’s Camus. It was "because of the sun." That’s what the protagonist says. He was too hot. I think you’re maybe oversimplifying it, Junn. But life is over-simple, sir. That’s why people like you don’t seem to get on well with this world. You’re too used to thinking and dissecting everything... It’s hard to embrace simplicity. Do you want to hear a track from the album? Do you mind? Welcome to the New Age Today luxury liners are trendy as hell There's a bunch of proud people Feeling like they're the best Even if they're not skilled at all Welcome to the New Century The future is now Written on the labels On every merchandise Are you ready for it? I need to know it Welcome to the Era of the Sharks Everyone's the same Yet we're not peers Everyone's an enemy and... Why don’t you go back to school, Junn? Why should I go back? Do you remember a guy called Luigi? No, I don't. Is he a friend of yours? I don’t know. Anyway, he’s dead. You can die just like that, from one day to the next. Simplicity. Nice, isn't it? - Junn, my money! - Ah yes, of course. I’m sorry. Thanks. Sir? "It’s better to burn than to disappear." That’s what "Kammus" says. In the book. This is a "No Smoking" area. Next patient! Next! Why are you here? I'm here because my ears hurt. The little box. Give it to me. Should I open my mouth? A little more? - I didn't tell you to cough. - I'm sorry. Stop it. Quit it! Good. Now you can cough. Now? Again. Why did you say you had a pain in your ears? What do you mean "why"? The ears have an high frequency of infection in early childhood. - Do you have any children? - No. - Do you work with children? - I'm a substitute high school teacher. Those aren't young children. Do you tend to frequent children in your private life? Do you have any friends or family members with small children? Well... a few. Do you often pick them up, touch them, or rub against them? - How do you mean? - Answer the question. - No, of course not. - So your problem is not in your ears. - No? - No. But I've got this... There's a pain in my ears. Look, if there was a pain I'd have noticed it. I can also hear a sort of ringing noise. You see that? What? That. That's my degree in medicine. Where's yours? Your medical degree. - I have a degree in philosophy. - Which is useless, as you know. Get undressed. Say "You are the best". In what sense? Say it. You are the best. With more conviction. You are the best! Word by word. You... are... the... There is absolutely nothing wrong with you. - But this ringing sound... - It is impossible. But since you insist that there's a problem with your ears... here's what you can do: have an ultrasound scan of your abdomen done. On the third floor. I suggest you should have it done privately if it's urgent. Excuse me, but why exactly... would I need a scan of my abdomen if...? Next! - Is everything alright? - I must kindly ask you not to talk. I was sent up here to you by Professor Silvestre, the otolaryngologist... That doctor is absolutely incompetent. Doctor... is everything OK? Stefania? Please call Dr. Sannio and tell him to come and see me immediately... Thank you... Wait! Cancel all my appointments for this afternoon and call the chief of surgery... He's not here today? Try to contact Castelli. Both him and Sannio. Make it quick. Thank you. Doctor... I've done thousands of these tests. But unfortunately, things don't always go as we would like them to go. Do you understand? Yes, of course. Does this mean I have a... Come on, say it. Don't be afraid. Is it... a tumor? No, it's not. Oh God! - For a moment... - If only it were so simple. Well, we sometimes encounter some apparently inexplicable situations. Do you believe in God? No. OK, in God or in something else, - something bigger than us? - I don't think so. I have something serious, don't I? You didn't know you were a hermaphrodite, did you? What? Just as I thought. You didn't know! You possess a set of both male and female primary sex characteristics. As it is located in the most hidden area of the perineum you have probably never noticed the presence of... well... - That I also have a...? - A female reproductive system. Yes. - But... where? - But there's more. You have a womb and also ovaries. - But how... - Just a moment, please. Just as I thought. - Was the diagnosis wrong? - Hardly. You're pregnant. It's a miracle. Are you sure you don't believe in God? - How can I possibly be pregnant? - See for yourself. Hermaphroditism has occasionally been associated with very exceptional cases of self-fertilization. It's sometimes enough to have a wet dream, or to indulge in unprotected masturbation, and... So, are you going to keep it? I realize that it was not a planned pregnancy. So, if you want... After all you have no religious issues with this. Hello? They have arrived? Good. Thank you. I have to say goodbye. What do you mean? You can pick up all your test results from my secretary. - But what am I supposed to do? - Pay Stefania for the consultation. Let me know what you want to do. There aren't any of those loopy-loo conscientious objectors here. This is a serious hospital. If you want it we will... Wait a minute. I was almost to forget this. It's really important. Please, put down your hand. Be still. I'm sorry! - This is the first time... - First time? I've been trying to do this for four years now! Was it a joke? - So that means I'm fine? - Of course! - That's the real problem! - What problem? - The problem with patients like you! - In what sense? Many of you tell me: "Doctor, I think I'm dying!" "Please, auscultate me, Doctor! There must be something wrong..." When I tell them there's nothing wrong, they seem almost disappointed. "But there must be something wrong. Please doctor. Check again." Those like you are a pain in the ass! I've really got this ringing! According to my tests there's nothing wrong. So you're absolutely fine. If you want, you can consult this doctor. So he'll leave all worries behind you. I'll sue you! Go ahead! I'll be retiring in three months anyway! Thanks to you I have reached all my goals! And don't forget to pay Stefania! Hello mate! - How are you? - Hi. I was just passing through your neighborhood. Let me give you a kiss! Atta boy! Just yesterday me and Giovanna were talking about you. You're still together with... what's her name? - Alice. - Good for you! - So it's becoming serious. - Yes. We had such a great summer with the two of you. You're in great shape. Well actually I woke up with... - a ringing sound... - A ringing sound? In my ears, since this morning. it's driving me mad, and in fact... Try eating something. There's the restaurant of a friend of mine next door. I can get a table for you. Have some lunch in peace and quiet! Don't... No need to refuse a favor from your favorite colleague! Thank you, Remo, but... - I just want to relax at home. - No! - What do you mean? - You can't shut yourself up. You never ever go out! - Do you want some good advice? - No. The body is like an automobile. Your ear problem is the warning light on the dashboard. Fresh air, oxygen, a nice walk. "A healthy mind in a healthy body". Thanks for the suggestion. I'll see you soon. Come on now! - Why don't you take a walk? - Why should I? I really need it. What? The house. Your house. Look, I'll tell you the truth, 'cos that's what real friends like us we always have to do. I was waiting for you. We were waiting for you. I called up a few friends and... Some of those guys are total assholes. So you're my last hope. I saw that you didn't have any lessons at school today.. Don't force me to take her to a hotel. It would feel squalid. Do you remember how much fun she had? What? Alice. This summer. What's she got to do with it? I don't know... It has been a long time since Alice... - Since...? - Since she smiled. She still smiles of course. But... The corners of the mouth... as if something was blocking them. - As if the smile was... - Fake. Do you know what that means? No, I don't. The same warning light, but on Alice's dashboard is more dangerous. Don't ever underestimate it. That's what my wife did. - What's your wife got to do with it? - We used to party like crazy. And the sex was fantastic. Everything was perfect. But then, slowly, something started to turn off. I sent her the right little signals, like this mouth thing you were telling me about. But she ignored them. And... this is the result, see? Don't make the same mistake my wife made. You're still on time. No offense, but luckily you and Alice are very different people. We are all different until we become equal. That means nothing. It means nothing until... it means everything. - Whatever... - Listen to me. Go buy her a bunch of roses, then go straight to her... and tell her that without her... you are nothing. You're a nobody and you're not going anywhere. Like me, without my wife Giovanna. A couple of hours at the most. Love: don't ever underestimate it. Love is everything in this life. I envy you. You still have a chance. Thank you. Open your mouth. Anna, can you prepare me 100 cc? Please stay calm. There's no need to worry. - Hello. - Oh God! What are you doing here? Good morning. Please excuse me. I'll leave right away. I wanted to give you these. Sorry! I was just going past a flower shop and I thought... Thank you. Actually I went to the florists on purpose. - Good for you. - They are beautiful, thank you. - I'll just put them down over here. - No! - Over here? - No! Put them over there. Don't! It's not really the right moment. I'm sorry, but I just wanted to ask if you could... Could I... what? Take that off. Just for a moment. Why? I just wanted to see you... See what...? I wanted to see you smile. Why do you want to see me smile? Well... I wondered if you really smile when you're with me. - Excuse me... - Just a second and he'll be leaving. I'm leaving in a second. Why, do I look sad to you? - Did I say that? - No. - Did I say that? - No. You don't always have to be sad for you not to smile. - I don't get you, really I don't. - Me neither. Can you... Excuse me. Are you still OK staying with me? What kind of question is that? Of course I am. Wouldn't you like to go out... Where would you like to go? Where? - Where should I want to go? - Don't you have fun with me anymore? Yes, I have fun with you... Perhaps I am a bit too... Too what? I don't know, you tell me. But why are you saying these things to me? You are... as you are. - Meaning? - I mean that... You're not a very easy person, you know. Really? You're alright with me, of course. But, with other people... Well, maybe it's other people who are too... Too what? I don't know. Maybe it's other people who are too... different from me. Anyway, thanks for the flowers. They're beautiful. Call me when you've finished your job interview. Here I come. Then are you going to the funeral? The funeral of that friend of yours. I think so. On the phone... what exactly did they say? They just said... that he had died, that you were good friends. He really wanted you to go to the funeral. They said "good friends"? Mum! My boy! Did you have lunch? Thank you. Hello. A portion of chicken wings, one of chips, a slice of chocolate cake and... - a medium-sized Coke. - Some béarnaise sauce on the chips? What's béarnaise sauce? No, I guess. Some crunchy topping on the chocolate cake? - No. - Plain or milk? - What? - The chocolate. Plain or milk? Plain? Is that a question? - Give me plain milk. - That's the "Super Yum menu". With the "Super Yum menu" you get a saving of 70 cents and there is free gift... A FREE TWIKKY CAP! - A Twikky cap. - Our exciting Twikky cap. - I'll have that menu then. - Coming up! Actually, instead of the chicken wings could I have... a salad? I'd like to eat something lighter. - All menus are standard. No additions. - But they cost the same... You can't take out chicken and put in salad. There isn't even a button, here. OK, forget it. Give me a salad, a portion of chips, no béarnaise, a piece of chocolate cake, no topping, and a medium Coke. That's a modified Super Yum. I told you I can't do that. Do you know what's the menu with the salad called? - "Happy Light". - Do you want it? I don't want a modified menu. Give me the things I've asked for! OK. I'll have a Super Yum menu. Super Yum coming up! That will be 7.70. Enjoy your meal. OK, now give me a salad. Here I am. I had a problem with the menus. Don't always complain about everything... Where shall I start? I'm a little embarrassed... Tell me who this fellow is. Alright, this is... Nikolaj. So we meet at last! And when were you going to introduce him to me? Whenever I got the chance. You never leave your house. I could never have imagined that... You got the salad. Well done! - Yes, but... - But it's a chicken salad! A chicken salad? Chicken! - I can't believe it! - Keep your voice down, mum. Come on, a chicken isn't really an animal. It's more like a vegetable with legs. Did you hear that? How does he even think up these jokes?! Anyway, I'll decide where we eat next time! I told you I have an appointment near here in a while. And this is the only place in this part of town that I can afford. If you'd told me that I would have treated you. Wait! Yeah, like that. The box is hiding your face. Like that. What are you doing? I'm putting the photo online. It's so nice. I'll get stuck in, shall I? Enjoy your meal. So nice! What kind of appointment have you got? - A job interview. - That's a good thing then, isn't it? What's the matter with you? - The matter? - Are you OK? He doesn't look fine. - I'm OK! - You don't look it. If he says he's fine... - I've only got... - I knew it! - What? - That you weren't well! A good mother always notices everything. It's just that I woke up today with this ringing in my ears... You're not working too much, are you? - So what kind of work do you do? - He teaches history and philosophy. Cool! I'm a substitute philosophy teacher... Cool! What exactly do you do, yourself? Nikolaj is an artist. Oh really? He has performed all over Europe. I was also in New York. New York? Wow! Whereabouts? Well, I don't really remember right now, but... just about everywhere. He's also an actor. A performer. Please. I feel that just acting no longer makes any sense, and... So what do you actually do? I do... performances. It's a bit hard to explain it in words. But he does a lot of other things. He paints. - He builds with wood. - I used to build. Now I assemble. He's a kind of Leonardo da Vinci! You assemble? Look at this. You'll understand. - What's that? - It's a chest of drawers. - A chest of drawers? - He takes IKEA furniture sets and he changes them. He re-assembles them... and customizes them. First of all I throw away the instructions. Then I let myself be transported by my instincts as I assemble them. I would say that... I assemble emotions. What model was that? A "Hurdal". A "Hurdal"? Are you sure? A "Hurdal". - Yeah! - The energy... The energy! Will you listen to me now? Go and see this lady. Not another of your psychopathic lady friends, please! First of all Angela is a wonderful person. She cured your incipient herniated disc in... how many? Just three or four sessions. But you always had it in for her because of India. What about India? He took it badly because I went off to India with her. - For two years. - A year and a half. I only found out where she was a month later. It was an important journey. It was necessary. Anyway, she "cured" me by telling me to take Diclofenac, your... - Angela. - Speak with her. - Are you crazy? - Don't be so hard on your mother! Just talk with her. It isn't dangerous to speak with people sometimes, you know? They won't eat you! - But not with this madwoman... - You never seem to like anyone. Who do you esteem? There was... that professor. The one at university. He taught him, he was crazy about my son! What's his name? - Marinetti? - Yes! That's his name. You used to go and see him. Do you remember? - It's been ages since I saw him. - Because you never see anyone! Do you remember a guy called Luigi? No, I don't. Why? Oh yes! He was your classmate who sat next to you at school! No. That was Maurizio, Mum. So it isn't him. Who is it then? Well, he is someone who... What? Nothing... What's the matter? Well, he's someone who has... died. Oh, the poor guy! There's his funeral this evening, at 7 pm. Do you think... you could come with me? But my dear, I don't even know who he is. Why would I go there? Ever since your father's funeral I've never been able to attend another one. They just make me so sad. OK, It's late. I've got to go now. Wait on. Just a moment. Let's take a picture of us all together. - We don't need that! - Let's wear these! Put this on, we'll take a picture. - You're crazy, mum! - It's funny, come on! What the heck! Sorry, I was just... Good evening. Hello. I have an appointment with the editor-in-chief. - The editor-in-chief is waiting for you. - Thank you. - I'm looking for the editor-in-chief. - Over there. So you are my 3.30 pm appointment. Yes. It was him who found me a place in this newspaper. Well, it was certainly a prestigious recommendation. "Yours is not a recommendation, it's a prison sentence." That's what he said to me during my first interview. Did he? And then I convinced him to write for our paper. "The strength of a newspaper with an opinion "is the strong opinions of those who write in it", that's what Italo said to me. - That Italo? - Yes. Italo. Our newspaper has always prided itself on its exceptional collaborators. I've read some of your writings. I like them. Thank you. I would like to entrust you with a new feature on philosophy. I don't know what to say. For me writing in your newspaper would be... More. - More? - Our newspaper is about to take a big step forward. Something more, as I just said. A color supplement. But not just like any other. Something strong, that has a real effect on things, that talks about things the way they are. A cultural exposition... More. More? "The biggest flaw of philosophy "is its tendency to become detached from reality." - This was said to you by...? - Me. Oh, you. I'm offering you the great opportunity to bring philosophy out of the old academic world and intellectual circles... to get back into the "Agora". A philosophy column that will present a new interpretation of the great issues of our time, of our era, and of our society. We are about to bring out the first issue. The latest gossip. SUMMER IS COMING The great stories of the most famous personalities and, in a beautiful setting, the Corner of the Philosopher. All yours. - All mine? - Yes. The Corner of the Philosopher. Well... You... aren't one of those people, are you? What people? Those who live outside of their own time. I don't know. Do you know how many people there were at the funeral of Pope Wojtyla? A million. But we'll reach five. - Five what? - In one way or another this magazine will be seen by five million Italians. Five. That's five funerals of a Pope. Kant and the topless swimsuit. It sounds like the title of an essay by poor Umberto! The photo of an actress in a thong, and a space for your own column underneath it, where you will compare it to the Aphrodite Kallipygos of Ancient Greece. So, are you interested? ...a contract for 2,500 Euros a month, which is not exactly peanuts. Sure, 2,500... - Of course. - Look, I can hear you very well. I may be a bit elderly, but I'm not deaf! Do you realize what an opportunity we have here? Enough of this elitist culture! Culture must be universal... It's our duty. The duty of us as intellectuals. Right? Well, in a sense... Look, your proposal... Are you OK? Everything's fine. I accept! Sorry, I woke up with a ringing sound in my ears... A ringing sound? I tried going to an otolaryngologist, then to a gastroenterologist... A gastroenterologist? For your ears? I don't even want to think about it! He even made me think I was pregnant! Well, you must forgive me now but I have a meeting... When will I sign the contract? Well... obviously we still need to meet the other candidates before making a final decision. No, but for the contract... We'll definitely let you know within the next week or so. But now... I really must say goodbye to you. You really aged. - Did you recognize me? - Yes. I've not gone totally gaga yet. Come in. Is the professor... at home? Do you know how to prune a Pachira Acquatica? A Pachira? I'm in a bit of a hurry... The professor is in his study. Let's give him some peace and quiet now. Excuse me if I just dropped by... A Pachira Acquatica should be pruned every three months. Listen, go and re-pot the Dahlia. The Dahlia...? You need to put a wet napkin under the dirt. Over there. Good. - A napkin... - Yes, it's OK. Go ahead. You know, I really enjoyed reading the essays that you used to write for my husband as homework. If only people re-read the things that they wrote when they were young... How many stupid things I wrote... And what could be nicer than thinking stupid things without realizing they are so stupid? Isn't that... the privilege of youth? But your ideas were not so stupid at all. My husband practically doted on you. And I thought so too. We both thought you were a genius. Thanks. But we were both sadly mistaken. Could you get the Barbera? It provides the mineral salts. Pour it in. Come on, don't be afraid! Pour plenty of it... - ...into the vase? - That's right. I guess... I had my opportunities. It's just that... I didn't want to compromise. People tend to confuse compromise with acceptance. Acceptance is surrender. Also my husband was just like you... Unfortunately. I suppose you too think that the world is "going crazy"? That's obviously the case, isn't it? Come here. Look at that man. He's been living here for a couple years now. He collects everything, but he especially loves telephone directories. He has put together his own personal library. Do you think he is crazy? Well, of course... Phone books are books that no-one wants anymore. I occasionally bring him some for his collection. If you saw me doing it, you would probably think I was crazy, too. Other people seem about as strange to us as we probably seem strange to them. So why did you come here? I wanted to see... how you two were getting on. Please, don't bullshit me. I needed... to talk... with him. It may sound ridiculous, but... this morning I woke up with... a ringing noise. In my ears. He used to call it "the noise of thoughts". That was so long ago. And now... Don't make the same mistake as my husband. Professor... He can't hear you. He sometimes goes through periods like this. How are you, Professor? You're here early. It's gonna take them at least another half hour here. The funeral service was supposed to be in the morning. But then with this disinfestation problem... Cockroaches. Hundreds of them. A helluva lot. If you want there's a bar just opposite here, Marcello. You are Marcello, aren't you? It isn't even ringing! Now come on, that has to be a 5, it's a 5! - Evidently it isn't. - It's a 5! It has to be a 6... 6-4-7. 5-4-7 is my number, the one that you called this morning. Alice, my girlfriend, answered it. I called you instead of his friend! Why didn't he write it properly? He was dying. It was quite well written. There's a stain on it. I was giving him the last rites. My hands were still stained with holy oil. It looked exactly like a 5. All day trying and figure out who this guy Luigi was... He said to me: "I had only one friend in my life. Call him and...". The usual, please. I'll have... a pear juice. A fruit juice? No way! Two vodkas. Neat. No, please... Two vodkas. Neat. Trust me. I can't believe this! What was he like? Who? - This guy Luigi. - I didn't know him. He seemed to be a regular guy. Very solitary, though. When I went to his house no-one else was there. The first thing he said was: "I have to warn you that I'm an atheist." He needed someone he could confess his errors to, and as no one else was there for him. Another one. He said that his greatest sin was that he hadn't been able to get used to it. To what? To the world. To other people. We look for a thousand excuses to avoid admitting that we're afraid of others. I know that very well. If fear didn't exist I'd probably be unemployed, I guess. Have you ever read the Bible? - Some of it... - I read it every God-given day. And, objectively speaking, there are some passages I sometimes read that... how can I say it mildly? They don't mean a fuck. It's obviously just nonsense. But I know... that certain passages have to be taken literally, and others... How can I put it? ...more allegorically. How do you know which ones are which? Easy. The parts that make sense should be taken literally. The rest is allegorical. People need the Bible, rest assured. Everybody knows that some bits don't actually mean anything. Listen to this one. I was called out to this village, just outside town. By these two old ladies, real country folk, in their fifties, but they looked at least seventy. They told me the image of the Virgin Mary had suddenly appeared in their house. I've never understood why the Madonna appears only to farmers and shepherds. It must be a side effect of the outdoor life. They kept on calling me. They wouldn't give up. So finally I went. And they showed me an old wall with the paintwork peeling off it and said: "Here it is". - And they knelt. - But what was it? An old patch of mold. It was clearly an old patch of mold. But I said yes, it was the Madonna. I gave them my blessing. Do you know why? Why? Because I gave them a better life. That's precisely what they pay me for, isn't it? If you believe in something you are less afraid. Life is too short to be afraid. I'd better be off to do this funeral now. Put it all on my bill. So, what are you doing? Are you coming? I have to... I have to do something first. Are you going to finish that vodka? No. Listen, I wanted to bring your flowers home, but then I thought they better stay in my office. Are you all right? Let's do it. What? Alice, let's do it. Let's do what? Let's have a child. Is it too much? I guess we could decide to live together at least. But you have always said that... I know... - So what has happened? - You... make me want... to give you a better life. And then there's that. Your smile. How much I missed it! There at the corners of your mouth. Please, don't ever do it again. What? Hold it back. You're crazy. But... weren't you supposed to be at the funeral of that friend of yours? This one was opened a few days ago, wasn't it? Don't lie to me! - We have concluded the service, so... - Can I say something first? Well, OK. Why not? Leave him some space, come on. In our lives we often... delude ourselves that we know people. And then, only when it is too late, we see that in fact... they are just perfect strangers. But Luigi was not a... Luigi was... Luigi, I remember that you were always penniless. You had a job that you didn't like. You said that for you... was better to live like that than to compromise. You boasted that you weren't like other people. But the truth is that you would have liked... to be like them. You defended yourself by saying the world was stupid, and that it made no sense. And your solution was... to run away from it, and close it all... outside your door, even though there were also some people out there... ...who loved you. You see Luigi, the world... can really be absurd, wrong and incomprehensible. But it's the only world that we have. Do you remember how angry you got when you saw happy people? "How can anyone be happy in a world like this?", you asked. But what you felt was not really anger. It was envy. Because the people you considered to be... stupid, ignorant or superficial somehow managed to reach... a strange, and perhaps illusory, but also real, kind of happiness. But you knew that you would never have felt that way. Do you know whose fault it was? It was not the world's fault, not the people's fault... or of those close to you. The only person to blame was yourself. The fact that you considered the world to be... stupid, did not make you more intelligent, but more unhappy. And above all, more alone. Madness... is the new normality. You have to get over it, Luigi! You have to accept it. In order to survive... and not to be alone... and forgotten. And I don't want to forget you, Luigi. I don't want to forget you. Well done! What beautiful words those were, my love! Well done. Mum... Nikolaj insisted to come. He felt that you really needed us to be here. It was such a beautiful speech... I mean it! - You know what we should do now? - What? We should take a picture. With your friend Luigi. To remind us of this moment. Look what I've still got! But you're... I adore you! You really can't say no, can you? Yes. Let's do it, Mum. Yes! Wait! Nikolaj, you're out of frame. Bow down. Don't block Luigi. Wait... Wait... How did all that ringing in your ears end up? I've still got it. But you know, mum, I guess... it doesn't really bother me that much. Say cheese!
