Can… we talk? Actually… I've wanted to tell you this for a while now. But… back then, I didn't know how to tell you. It's about my feelings for you. I… like you. And I… love you. Will you… go out… with me? 102.2FM Prambors Rasisonia, this is Ega. To senior students in high school now, have you applied to any colleges? Are you planning to study here or abroad? Many colleges are now accepting applications. I'll list them down in a while, but before that, I've got something special for you. Mom? Did you see the pamphlet that I left in your room? -What pamphlet? -About studying abroad. Oh, not yet. I haven't had the time. What's important now is Rio's wedding. We're counting days! Do you really want to study there? Yes, I already told you. Why won't Mom allow me to study abroad? It's not that I'm not allowing you. I just don't know what it's like there. I'm not sending you there alone. I promise I will behave. I trust you. Hey, honey, can you believe Rio is getting married? Yes, he's 26 now, isn't he? -Weren't we younger when we got married? -Yes, we were. Al, your brother's tying the knot. What about you? I'm already pregnant with my third child. You should do it soon. Do what? Don't pretend like you don't know. How am I supposed to get married if you don't approve of every guy I like? -Then leave that part to me. -Mom! I have someone for you. You know, it's Ika's son, our neighbor across the street. He's back from the US. He's kind, smart, and handsome. I think he's studying computer science or mathematics. He's pious too! I think he's the perfect husband for you. That's right, you know. -Our neighbor doesn't have a son. -She does. It's just that he's been studying abroad. I really think he's your type. No! I'll find my own man. Don't be shy. He's really nice. You should come with me tomorrow to her house. All the neighbors are gathering there. She's throwing a small welcoming party for her son. Just come with me for a while. If you want to know about studying in the US, you can ask him. I think he goes to Berkeley. Really? Okay then. -But just for a moment. -Okay. Tell you what. Once you graduate, you should marry him. If you do, it would be very convenient for us. We can just throw a party that connects our houses. If you live there, it's just right across the road from our house. -You can drop by often. -That's right. And when I miss my grandchildren, I can just cross the street. You're getting ahead of yourself. Our in-laws would love the idea. Let me talk to them later. But honey, what if her husband takes Aliza to the US? There's a rumor going around the neighborhood. Do you guys know about it? What? -Really? -What is it? Tell me. Rio, watch your mouth! Don't just spread gossip! You should be ashamed of yourself. What are you guys talking about? Come here. Gosh. Finally. Gosh. Oh, dear. -Honey, give me a hand, please. -Rio will pick it up later. Just leave it there. How do I even… This is all your fault, spreading rumors and shocking people. What a bother. You can't even open the taxi's trunk. So annoying! Aliza, you're coming with me tomorrow! Gosh. You are all annoying. This is your fault! Grab those! Hi, Dara! Where's your mom? -Hi! -Hi, Ika! Hi, gorgeous! Oh, you shouldn't have bothered. -It's just a little something. -Come in! -Aliza helped me bake a cake. -How nice! -Everyone's been waiting. -Oh, so everyone's here? What a lovely house! -Is that everyone? -Yes, they're all here. -You have to try this cake I made. -Okay, let's go. Come here, sweetie. -Ladies, please don't hesitate. -Hi! Hi, I'm Aliza. Dara. I heard you just got back from the US. Yes. What's it like there? Is it fun? It is. I heard from Mom that you go to Berkeley. -Yes. -I would love to study there too. I'm still browsing colleges on the Internet though. How are people like there? Are they fun? Depends. Depends on what? I've never been there. -Is studying hard there? -Not really. -Where do you live? -Apartment. -With who? -My uncle. Does he get charged for every word he says? Where's Mom? Still at our neighbor's. Did you go there? What do you think? Are the rumors true? I didn't see anything weird. Where's your mother? Still at our neighbor's, Dad. Go get her. Uncle Sudiro just called. He's on his way here. Rio, go get your mother, now. Hold this. Mitha! What are you guys up to? My brother's future in-laws are coming. Let's go upstairs. Okay. Your brother sure got a nice catch. She's pretty too. I bet she's nice, huh? Of course, she is. Did you just come back from a wedding? No, my dad told me to wear this. It was just for a party across the house. What's going on at that house? A gathering. I wouldn't go there if my mom didn't force me. What sort of gathering? Just a welcoming party for her son. Her son? Yes. He's so weird! Even his hair is weird. Also, he barely even speaks. He just gives you one-word answers. That's great! It's better than a chatterbox like you. How dare you. Hey, Al? Can you see his room from here? What does he look like? Does he have a six-pack? Or a seven-pack? Well… What? No way! He could be! His name is Dara! Why does he have a girl's name? That's what I'm saying! We should go there now. Let's go. Are you crazy? What for? So we can find out if the rumor your brother said is true. We should see his room, Al. Let's go. What can we find in his room? If what you said is true, there should be some signs, some weird objects, anything. I don’t know. Oh, photos. He must have a lot of photos. Come on, I'm dying to know. Wait. What's our excuse? Why do you think his name is Dara? I don't know. Maybe it's his nickname. Gosh, Dara. I wonder what he looks like. If he gets angry, I'm not taking the blame. All right, but you should stay right beside me. Don't laugh at me if I get awkward. And don't run away! You have to help me. -Do we just knock? -Yes. He's coming! Hi, Aliza. Hi. Is Dara home? Yes. He's back there, swimming. Come in. What's up? Meet my friend, Mitha. I'm Mitha. Dara. I wanted to borrow some notes for math. Mom said you study computer science or mathematics. Do you have any? Wait a second. No, not that one. Which one then? I was told to look for notes on the Internet! Yes, that's what I meant. For calculus at school. All right. Where are you going? Your place. What for? To help you search on the Internet. Not at my house. -Why not? -What? The computer at my place is broken because of a virus. That's why I came here to use your computer. Is it okay? Follow me. Found it. No way. I've tried looking for it everywhere. You can find everything on this website. Oh, you're right! See, Mitha, I told you. This website has everything! You know about this website? Of course! I wanted to check that website at home. But Mitha said I wouldn't find what I needed there, so I didn't bother checking. I thought your computer was broken? Yes, it is. -So? -What? It just broke. It was fine a couple of hours ago. Hey, can you print that page for me? If I still don't get it, I'll come to ask you again. Thank you. We should go. Sorry for bothering you. So… He's really… I can't believe it. Me neither! Aliza! What's he doing? I'm just borrowing this. I'll bring it back when I'm done. I didn't chase you for that. Is Rio home? Yes, with his future in-laws. Want to hang out? Dara is asking me out? What's wrong? Are you too busy? No, I'm not. All right, I'll just go inside. Give me five minutes. I'll go change. Oh, my god. He's taking you out! This is crazy! What should I wear? Hurry up, you're going on a date! He wants to be your boyfriend! He wants to get serious with you! What about this? Or this? This one? -I'm so excited. -This is cute! How about this? It's been five minutes! Come here, hurry! Hey, where are you going? Out. Wait, where's Ayu and the others? They left already. Wait here. I need to grab my wallet. Is it still on? Yes. Where to? The movies. Really? Let's go, Dar. Al, take care. -So he was… -Yes. -You didn't… -No. -But you've… -I know. -Now he's out with… -Yes. -So he wasn't… -No. Gosh, Tha. I'm so embarrassed. This is all because of his one-word replies! It's all right. As your friend, I'm also embarrassed. Let's just go out. We can follow him if you want. No way. I've lost the mood to go out. MY LOVE IS CALLING Babe? Where are you? I'm at Aliza's. What's wrong? Can I go there now? Of course. Al, can Angga come over? Sure. All right. I'm on my way, okay? Okay. Is something wrong? You don't normally come over like this. I'm not going there to hang out. Then what? Gosh… I can't tell you over the phone. I'll tell you later. I'll tell you when I get there. Oh, okay then. I'll be waiting. Don't take too long. -I miss you. -I know. I miss you too. Oh, you miss him. Is he coming yet? Maybe. Angga, wait! -No need to open the garage, I'll do it. -Yes, just leave it. Oh, my god. What happened to your face? Angga, what happened? Can I go inside? I'm exhausted. Let's go inside. Be careful. Where have you been? I… There was a briefing for the basketball tournament at school. And so you decided to come home late? I had to be there, Dad. I'm on the team. Please stop! Open the door! Open it! You've been acting up since your mother died! I miss you too. That's what happened. How could he do that? I know. You just came home late. Why did he have to beat you up like this? It's just how he is. You know this, babe. So where are you going to stay, Angga? I think I'm going to stay with Tama for a while. I told him everything. He told me to stay at his place. At Tama's? Yes. He's the only friend I have who understands all of this. We'll take you there. Right, Al? Don't worry. You should get some rest first. Thank you. Is it good? This whole album is gold. There's one more, but it's upstairs. Let me go get it. Oh, you're home? -Yes. -Where did you go? I dropped off Angga at Tama's. I see. Wait here. So did you go to the movies? Yes. Did you go out with your boyfriend? What? No. I better go upstairs. Aliza. Yes? About your brother's wedding… What about it? I don't have a plus one. Are you trying to say… you want to go with me? Yes. Will you? Sure. Here's the CD. That's yours. Thanks. I should go. Can you get the door, please? Where is she? Dara? You got a haircut? You look nice. Thanks. Am I… Am I too early? Oh, no, you're not. I'm ready. -I just need to-- -Do you want… If you want… I… I can… Thanks. Shall we? Okay. I just need to grab my purse. Thanks. Uncle Sudiro! Show us your moves! Aliza. Where have you been? The usual. Where's Mom? We've been waiting. Hi, Dara. -Good evening. -Ayu, congrats! -See you inside. -Okay. -Thank you. -What took you so long? You know, girl stuff. Let's go there. Later! Thank you. -Thank you. -Congrats. -Thanks for coming. -Thank you. No way. -I'm with her. -We're single. -You look gorgeous. -Really? -Nice dress. -Doesn't it suit me? What do you think about my sister-in-law? She's gorgeous, right? Totally! Thanks for driving me. You really shouldn't have. It's all right. Because… I live nearby anyway. -Al? -Yes? Do you… have a boyfriend? No. But… back then… you must have had one, right? Yes. But I'm single now. Back then, how was your… first kiss? What? Was it long? Or short? Well, it's… I don't know. Anyway, American girls are pretty. So how many girlfriends have you had? Why did I ask that? I wasn't interested in them. Really? Yes. This is a nice song. Right. It's romantic. Right. I better go. Aliza. Wait. Are you all right? I'm all right. The door's jammed. You can't open it from the inside. What? That's why I keep getting it for you. Oh, no wonder. That's okay. I should go inside. Al, the umbrella. No… No need. Bye. I'm fine. Why did I have to fall? It's so embarrassing. Hi. Did you just get home? I need to go to the supermarket. You stay home, dear. Come on, it's starting! -Which number? -I don't know. Dara? You're here too? Who are you with? This is Fadli. Aliza. Right, this is Tama. Tama, this is Dara. He lives across the street. -I'm Tama. -I'm Dara. Is he your boyfriend? -No. -Yes. He's my friend. Oh, it's Dara! Mitha. Oh, right. Want some? No, thanks. What are you guys watching? We're at Studio 3. Let's watch a movie together. Sure. Should we all sit in a row? Okay. Let me get it. No need to. I'll get it. -Who's with him? -I don't know. I can't believe you took me here. Look at the view. It's breathtaking. Dinda, I've been meaning to take you here. -Really? -Yes. This place will be the witness of our love. Adi, you're being silly. -I'm serious, Dinda. -How? What do you mean? I need to go to the restroom. -Should I go with you? -No, you don't need to. It's all right, I need to go too. Would you be my girlfriend, Dinda? Adi, I'd love to! Of course, I want to! I thought you only saw me as a friend. The doors to Studio 8 are open. Customers who have purchased a ticket may now enter. The doors to Studio 8 are open. Customers who have purchased a ticket may now enter. Excuse me. -Excuse me. -Here it is. Thank you. Excuse me. Dinda, I need to tell you something… about our relationship. Oh, Adi. This is mine, right? Why did you leave me? You said you were going to wait. It's over for us. Adi… I'm sorry, Dinda. I can't continue this relationship. I have to leave now. No, Adi. Wait, Adi! What now? I told you everything. Is Dara really holding my hand? And in front of Tama. Come to think of it, it should be okay. Tama isn't my boyfriend anyway. Why did you change seats? We… We come from different backgrounds. My parents didn't approve of our relationship. They set me up with someone else. How could you do this to me? Wrong seat? What? No. It's all right. That happened to me once. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm sorry, Dinda. I believe… The film at Studio 1 is starting. Customers may enter the room. The film at Studio 3 is starting. Where are we going now? I don't know. Where should we go? Let's go grab something to eat. Are you guys hungry? Dar, you should join us. I can't. -Why not? -I have to go. Where? Home. I have to wake up early tomorrow. Okay then. Let's go out together. I had so much fun tonight. We should have hung out sooner. It's weird. We go to the same school. But why haven't I noticed you sooner? I've known you for a long time. Really? Does that mean you like me? Not really. I was interested at first. But it was hard to get to know you. You know me now. What do you think? Nothing in particular. Gosh, Al. If we knew each other sooner… we would be so close now. Too bad we're only hanging out now. Why don't we get to know each other better? I have to go. It's late. My mom's waiting for me. Don't just leave. Just stay here for a while. I don't think so. I really need to go. It's really late. Tam! Are you all right? It's late. You should go. Dad? Rio! Gosh. What happened? Were you there when it happened? Not really. I just dropped him off at his place. He said he wanted to go home tonight. He said it was time to go home. It's late. You should go. Your mom will be worried. All right. Tomorrow, once you wake up, call me, okay? Okay. Babe. Thanks for dropping me off. I should be the one taking you home. It's okay. It's not like I live far away. I should go. Take care. I thought something had happened to Angga, but it was his father's blood. Oh, dear, Tha. I was shocked. I was panicking. I didn't know what to do. Something's wrong with Angga's dad. But why does he keep wanting to see his dad? He loves his dad, Al. There, there. Don't cry. If I knew this would happen… I wouldn't have let him go home. Thank god he's okay. I don't even know… Hey, Aliza. Good morning. Good morning. Is Dara home? Dara has left. Where to? Back to the US. His flight was early in the morning. Did he leave on short notice? Not really. He's been planning to leave today. He can't stay in Jakarta for too long because the new semester has started. I see. All right then. -Thank you. -Don't you want to come in? No, thank you. Mom's waiting for me. -All right, say hi to her for me. -I will. Oh, you're home? How is Angga? He's okay but still in shock. His father died. I feel sorry for him, but at least no one is going to hurt him anymore. Are you all right? You look sad. I'm okay, Mom. By the way, Dara came over and asked for you this morning. I told him you were at the hospital. -What time? -Let me think. I think it was around 7:00 a.m. I'm not sure. What's wrong? Hello! Look, they're here. When did they arrive? A couple of hours ago. Let's go meet them. Smile for me, okay? We should bring a huge suitcase. -Yes, to fit more things in. -What do we need to bring? There she is! Come here, sit. -Scoot a little. -Come on. How are you? Is your friend okay? He's recovering. Aliza. Your dad and I have been talking about our plans to see colleges in the US. Right. And? -And he said it's okay, right? -Right. Are you serious, Dad? Yes. So where are we going? To London! For a 30-minute transit. And then we're flying to San Francisco! Really? Uncle Sudiro knows. It will be crowded. Hello? Are you ready? Honey, wake up! We're late! Aliza! Aliza, wake up! We're late! Come down here! Aliza! Yes, okay. Let's go. Hurry up! -Wait for me! -Come on! -Hopefully, everything's fine. -Come here! Asih, take care of the house! Don't forget to lock everything and be careful, okay? Where's your bag? Are you all set? -Yes, okay. Is that everything? -Yes. All in. -Yes. -I'm all set. Thank God. Okay, are you sure nothing is left behind? Yes. Are you really sure? What about your toothbrush? Toothpaste? -No. -Nothing? -Towels? Wet towels? No? Okay, let's go! -We're ready! Get in! Isn't it chilly here in San Francisco? -Is there any food? -Yes. We have food. Don't worry. Come in! Just leave the luggage there. -Okay, Uncle. -The luggage. Let's eat. Come on. Come, let's eat. What's wrong, Aliza? Can you show me where my room is? Oh, your room is up there. It's the door to the right. -All right, thank you. -Sure. -I'll go upstairs first. -All right. Dig in! Okay. Hi, Dar! How are you? Hi, Dar! It's me Aliza. Do you remember me? Hi. Is this Dara? Uncle Sudiro? It's Dara. Dara, how are you? How have you been? We're having a BBQ party here. You should come! Did you call me just a while ago? No, nobody called. Wait. It might be Aliza. Hang on. Aliza! Aliza! Aliza? Yes? You have a phone call from Dara! Just use that phone in your hands! -Press the button! -What? Oh, okay! -Hi! -Did you… Did you call me? No! I was about to call someone, but maybe I pressed the wrong number. Wrong number? Really? What a coincidence. I know, right? So weird. You're in San Francisco? -Yes. -When did you arrive? We just arrived today. So how have things been here for you? Is everything good? Yes. What about college? Are things going well? Yes. -Dar. -Al. What is it? No, you go first. What is it? There's an event at the Palace of Fine Arts tonight. What event? There are several, so it's usually pretty crowded. Dar, are you asking me on a date? No. I'm planning to go there. -And? -If you want… I can take you there. It's tonight, right? Do you have plans? No, I don't have plans! All right then. I'll meet you there, okay? I have to hang out with my family, so I'll just meet you there after, okay? Did you wait? I just arrived. You… look different tonight. How? You look beautiful. Thanks. But just for tonight? What about the other days? No, I mean… What? I always like how you look. My car is right there. Where are we going? Let's go for a night drive. Dar, when are you going back to Jakarta? Why do you ask? I just want to know. Tomorrow. You're already going back tomorrow? Yes. Well, I guess it's fine. But you won't have anyone to hang out with. I'm kidding. For someone who speaks so little, who knew you could crack jokes too? When are you flying back? I'm not sure, but I'm planning to visit different colleges here with Mom. Al. Will you have dinner with me… the day after tomorrow? Will you? Where are we eating? At my apartment. What are we eating? I'll cook for you. You can cook? A little bit. But it's my birthday that day. Right. Do you want to spend your birthday… with me? Thanks for tonight. You're welcome. You always play this CD, don't you? Not really. Just when it gets… romantic. Thanks. I should go. I really should go. Can… we talk? Actually… I've wanted to tell you this for a while now. But… back then, I didn't know how to tell you. It's… It's about my feelings for you. I… like you. And I… love you. Will you… go out with me? Don't just do it yourself! Pass it on to your friend! This isn't soccer, you know. -Yes! -Oh, no. Oh, no! I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry, sir. Gosh, he's so big. -Fun, right? -Fun, but it's taking so long. I don't feel so good. -What's wrong? -The baby keeps kicking. -Are you all right? -I think so. -Does it hurt? -A little, but… Oh, this is so fun! Touchdown! It's a touchdown here too! -The baby's coming! -Help! Dad! It's coming! Are you sure? It's too soon! -I don't know! -Hang in there! -Let's take her to the hospital now! -Come on! Hang in there! The baby's coming! -Calm down. -You calm down! The baby won't calm down! Mom, take it easy. It's okay. Everybody, calm down! I know a good doctor from a good hospital. I just can't remember the doctor's name. -What's the name of the street? -Wait. Oh, right. We have a map. -What is it? -Montgomery. -Montgomery, okay. -Montgomery. We should go left. -Left? At the end of the road? -Yes. -Here. -Where? -Look out! -No! Relax. Thank God. It's okay. -Everybody, calm down. It's okay. -Okay. What do you mean it's okay? Look ahead! Left! Oh, God! -We should turn left up there! -Okay. Gosh, that was close. My heart almost jumped out of my chest. Now, which way should we go? -Oh, dear. -The map is gone. -What? -It flew out. Okay, calm down, everyone. I'm starting to recognize the streets. -I've got it. -Look out! Dad! Why are we stopping? There's traffic, honey. -Hello? -Aliza, where are you? I'm on the way to the hospital. -What's wrong? -Mom is going into labor. Which hospital? French Hospital. Calm down, everyone. We're almost there. Is the baby okay? Shush, will you? All right, this is probably not the right time. But I need to tell you that Ayu is also pregnant. Ayu is pregnant? She's pregnant! Congratulations! I'm going to be an aunt! -That means I'm having a grandchild! -You're going to be a grandpa! Congratulations! Look out! The police are chasing us. Should we stop? Don't! -Don't stop! The baby's coming! -No! Just relax. I'm speeding up! Take a deep breath! Red light! Don't stop! That was close. I'm still alive. Where is the hospital? We're almost there. Don't worry, I recognize this place. We're almost there. -Dar. -Yes? I visited your place yesterday. You did? Why didn't you come in? I saw you talking to a guy. I heard everything. I didn't want to bother you. You heard everything? Yes. Actually… I wanted to tell you in person. But… now you know everything. So… what do you think? About what? About us. What do you mean us? You know what I mean. You said you heard me that day. Actually, I've known for a while. -You have? -Yes. It's hard for me to accept this. We can still be friends, but it won't be that easy. I understand. I didn't believe it at first. But I saw you with that guy. You told him you love him. You hugged him. You even asked him to go out with you. I know I don't stand a chance. You should be happy with him. You must love him so much, don't you? Yes. What's his name? Arya. Do you live with him? Yes. I thought you said you lived with your uncle? He went back to Jakarta. -Al. -Yes? Have you seen my family photo? Not yet. Why? Isn't this the guy you were with? Yes. Your family knows him already? Yes. That's because… he's my brother. That's great. You're a little stiff though. But overall, that's how you confess. Don't be shy. Thanks, bro. I better go. Take it easy. Do you have your ticket? Yes, Mom. Dara is staying over tomorrow. Why can't you keep your room clean? Look at this huge poster. This would be a bother to take down. Is it okay? It's just a poster, Mom. All right then. Remember to study well. Don't just date and have fun. Okay. -So you're in love with your neighbor? -Yes. -Have you told her? -No. What's the problem? You just have to create a romantic set up. I did. -When? -When I took her home. What did you do? I put on a romantic song and turned it up. What? And then I told her it's a romantic song. You're so weird. That song has always been your only move. Have you told her you liked her? I'm planning to. But you couldn't because you don't know what to say? No, she fell out of the car. What? She fell? She even fell into a puddle. Dara, where are you going? To the movies. Gosh. This is impossible. I understand if you don't like me. I really do. No, Dara. You've got it wrong. I'm the one who liked you first. I'm the one who loved you first. -So you love me? -What? No. -Oh, you don't? -I do. You do? No, I don't. You said like. You said love. So you did… and now you don't? It's because you don't talk much. I misunderstood and took things the wrong way. I've kept count, and you only say at least seven words in a sentence. Why are you smiling? Nothing. Let's go inside. Happy birthday, Al. You did this for me? Blow the candles. Thanks, Dar. Al. I have something for you. What is it? Open it. Isn't this the CD you always play? Why are you giving it to me? So that… you can always remember me. When I'm with you… everything is romantic, even without music. I need to ask you something. You said you had an early flight. Why did you stop at my house? Well… I just wanted to say goodbye. That's it? Nothing more? I also wanted to tell you… that I liked you. You just like me? And I… love you. -What? -You heard me. No, I didn't. Can you say that again? I love you. I love you too. But I wanted you to say it first. Why should I say it first? Dar? You said you cooked for me? Right. Wait here. What did you cook? Noodles? Why did you cook instant noodles? You once said… it's the one thing that would keep you from studying abroad. Dar, I told you that ages ago. You still remembered that? That's not even important. Actually… those little things are worth remembering. Dara. You're unpredictable. You're actually caring. Tell me. When did you start liking me? I've liked you… from the first time I met you. Al, where's your little brother? He's asleep. Hey, so tell me. What happened? We ate, went for a walk, had some hotdogs, and then he took me home. That's awesome! Wait, I lost? I don't want to play anymore. I'm tired. Why not? How is Angga? Haven't I told you? He got a scholarship. He said he wants to be a doctor. Really? Where are you going to study? At the same university as Angga. So we're not going to be together? What do we do? I've been talking with Angga. After one or two semesters, I'll be studying in Los Angeles. It's in the program, Al. That means we'll be together again! You won't be too far from where I study. Does Angga want to be a doctor there? He said he wants to. So are you going to start studying in San Francisco next year? Yes. Are you in the same college as Dara? More or less. Gosh, you're even dating Dara now. But Al, you won't be seeing him for a while. It's okay. What's important is that I love him and that he loves me too. How do you know he loves you? We trust each other. Stop being so wise. -Hey, Al. -Yes? Dara is a guy. Aren't you afraid that he will misbehave when he's not with you? No. Dara is not that type of guy. -How do you know? -I just know. You should be careful. Dara's a catch. There must be so many girls flocking over to him. He might be tempted. No way. Can we stop talking about this? I don't want to overthink. -I'm going to bed. -Wait, put these away. Al, this is why you shouldn't date cool guys. Just date a normal guy or someone in the middle. No, thank you. Didn't you say that you don't judge a guy by his looks? But now you're dating a hot guy. Well, it just happened. Was I supposed to say no? If Dara wasn't that good looking, would you still want him? Of course. I told you, I never judge a person by their looks. But it's the first thing you see. Just admit it. I first look at his personality. If he's also good looking, then that's a bonus for me. I'm going to bed. Al. Al. Okay, listen. Just answer this one question. And then we'll sleep. Promise. Okay, what is it? If Dara looked like the security guard at school, would you be creeped out? Mitha! I'm not answering that! I'm going to sleep! Al, come on. Just answer me. Tell me, just this once. Would you be creeped out? A little bit. Subtitle translation by: Arina Nurul Azizah
