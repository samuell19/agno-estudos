WAIT A MINUTE. SINCE WHEN ARE YOU MY KEEPER? I DON'T WANT TO BE YOUR KEEPER, BUT I DON'T LIKE TO SEE YOU WASTING YOUR TIME, EITHER. I THINK THAT GIRL COMES FROM THE TRASH HEAP. MAYBE, BUT SHE ISN'T TRASH. GIVEN HALF A CHANCE, SHE COULD...BE SOMETHING. YOU PLANNING ON PROVIDING THAT CHANCE? I THINK I CAN HELP. HOW? GET HER IN A SCHOOL. YOU PLANNING ON EDUCATING A WHITE GIRL?

PICK UP THE RECEIVER. HERE'S A DIME. PUT YOUR HAND UP THERE. [DING DING] THIS ONE? MM-HMM. THAT'S THE ONE. OPERATOR, I'M BLIND, AND I CAN'T READ THE DIAL. WOULD YOU PLEASE GET ME 555-3268? THANK YOU. I'M DOING IT. IT'S RINGING! HA HA HA! THE NUMBER DOESN'T ANSWER. IT'S A SHAME TO TROUBLE HIM FOR NOTHING. SORRY I WASN'T IN. [DING] WHAT'S THAT? YOUR MONEY COMES BACK WHEN NOBODY ANSWERS. HERE. HEY! HERE. YOU KEEP IT FOR GOOD LUCK. NOW YOU GOT THAT? YEAH. HE AIN'T MUCH TROUBLE. I'M NOT HAVING THAT MANGY OLD BUZZARD, AND I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU'D BE GLAD TO LOSE HIM. BUT YOU DON'T MIND SELINA. WELL, THAT'S DIFFERENT. SHE CAN DO THE CHORES. WHEN CAN I SEE IT, SADIE? I'LL TAKE YOU AROUND THERE TONIGHT. OH, IT'S A SWELL PLACE. YOU'LL LOVE IT. OH. HOW ABOUT THAT? 73.

HE'S A LOT BETTER THAN ANYBODY-- DON'T YOU TELL ME TO SHUT UP, YOU UNGRATEFUL LITTLE CHIPPY! OW! OOH! OH! HIT ME, WOULD YOU? YOUR OWN MOTHER? IS THAT WHAT YOUR LEARNING FROM YOUR BLACK BOYFRIEND? OW!

SHE WIGGLES HER FAT CAN AT THE GROCER! YEAH! [SHOUTING IN ITALIAN] Man: OW! I GOT ONE OF THEM. AH! DID YOU SEE THE LOOK ON HIS FACE? WE FIXED THEM GOOD! HA HA HA HA! HA HA HA! OHH! [VOMITING] [VOMITING] STOP THAT. STOP IT, SELINA. LEAVE HER BE. SHE'S SICK. COME ON, GET UP. GET UP. I CAN'T. OH. EASY WITH HER. OH! EASY. OH, WHAT A MESS. WHAT ARE YOU SITTING DOWN FOR? CLEAN UP. WHAT? YOU HEARD ME. SHE'LL JUST MAKE IT WORSE. YOU DO IT. SHE'S YOUR KID. I'M GOING TO TAKE A BATH. [WATER RUNNING] I FEEL SO SICK, OLE PA. ME, TOO. I'M AN OLD MAN, SELINA. TOO OLD. I CAN'T CLEAN IT UP. I'D LIKE TO, BUT I CAN'T. I'M GOING OUT TO GET PLASTERED. DO YOU UNDERSTAND, SELINA? DON'T GO OUT. NOT TONIGHT, OLE PA. I HAVE TO. SORRY, SELINA. I'M A NO-GOOD OLD DRUNK. I'M A FLOP. [DOOR CLOSES] [ALARM CLOCK RINGING] [SOFTLY] COME ON, OUT OF IT. I GOT A LOT TO DO TODAY. AND I SETTLED YOUR HASH, TOO. KILLED 2 BIRDS WITH ONE STONE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, ROSE-ANN? WE'RE MOVING OUT OF THIS DUMP. [LOUDLY] MOVING OUT? SHH. KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN. HE DON'T HAVE TO KNOW EVERYTHING. [WHISPERING] But why are we moving? ME AND SADIE GOT PLANS. YOU AND SADIE? QUIT TALKING LIKE SOME PARROT. ME AND SADIE ARE GOING IN TOGETHER. WE GOT A NEW PLACE. SADIE SAYS WE CAN MAKE SOME REAL DOUGH. DOING WHAT? DON'T ASK STUPID QUESTIONS. ALL I KNOW IS I GOT A CHANCE TO GET OUT OF THAT CRUMMY HOTEL JOB, AND I AIN'T GOING TO MISS IT. I DON'T WANT TO GO ANYPLACE WITH THAT SADIE. YOU'LL DO AS YOU'RE TOLD, AND CONSIDER YOURSELF LUCKY THAT SHE'LL HAVE YOU AFTER WHAT WE SEEN. WELL, WHAT ABOUT OLE PA? NOTHING ABOUT OLE PA. THERE AIN'T GOING TO BE ANY ROOM. COULDN'T I STAY HERE AND LOOK AFTER HIM? I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE OLE PA. OH, THAT WOULD SUIT YOU, WOULDN'T IT, ON YOUR OWN? NO TELLING WHAT YOU WOULDN'T GET INTO. NOT A CHANCE. HERE. I SEE. BUT YOU COULD TAKE A GIRL OF THAT AGE? YES, I UNDERSTAND. ALL RIGHT. YES. I'LL BE THERE TOMORROW AT 3:00. THANK YOU. [TELEPHONE RINGS] [RING] THANKS TO YOU, DOLL, I'VE SEEN THE LAST OF THAT PLACE. I TOLD THEM JUST WHAT THEY COULD DO WITH THEIR LOUSY JOB. WELL, GOOD FOR YOU. I'VE BEEN WAITING TO DO IT FOR YEARS. YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE EXPRESSION ON THEIR FACES. HA HA HA! IT'S MIGHTY NICE OF YOU, DOLL, TO GIVE ME A HAND. I WASN'T LOOKING FORWARD TO PACKING ALL THIS STUFF. WELL, WE'RE PARTNERS NOW, AIN'T WE? SELINA? CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? AFTER THE SMACKING AROUND I GAVE HER LAST NIGHT? GET GOING ON THIS STUFF, HONEY. I'LL BE BACK AS SOON AS I CAN. COME ON, SPEEDY GONZALES, GET A MOVE ON. LOOK, ROSE-ANN, I TOLD YOU THE PLACE. IT AIN'T ANY SENSE IN ME COMING, TOO. I WANT TO MAKE SURE. CONGRATULATIONS! YOU MADE IT! HELLO! OH, GORDON, I TRIED TO PHONE YOU, BUT YOU WEREN'T HOME. WHY? WHAT HAPPENED? RO... ROSE-ANN'S TAKING ME AWAY. I WON'T BE ABLE TO GET HERE ANYMORE. WHERE IS SHE TAKING YOU? I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY, BUT SHE'S LEAVING HER JOB. SHE'S MOVING IN WITH SADIE. THEY'RE GOING TO START ONE OF THOSE PLACES. [SNIFFLING] OH, GORDON. WELL, THAT ROSE-ANN MUST BE SOME DAME. OH, SHE SURE IS. COME, LET'S SIT OVER HERE. AND JUST PUT THE WHOLE COCKEYED IDEA OUT OF YOUR MIND. HOW CAN I? I CAN'T HELP WONDERING WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO ME IN A PLACE LIKE THAT. JUST FORGET IT. NOW, THERE ARE LAWS AGAINST WHAT ROSE-ANN AND SADIE HAVE IN MIND, AND A WORD OR 2 IN THE RIGHT PLACE WILL SOON TAKE CARE OF THAT. THE COPS WON'T DO ANYTHING. THE COPS LIKE ROSE-ANN. YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT, SO STOP WORRYING. I CAN'T HELP WORRYING ABOUT IT WHILE IT HANGS OVER MY HEAD. IT IS NOT HANGING OVER YOUR HEAD, NOT ANYMORE. IN A FEW DAYS, I HOPE YOU'LL BE LEAVING ROSE-ANN FOR GOOD. I'VE FOUND A SCHOOL FOR YOU. A SCHOOL? AT MY AGE? PEOPLE GO TO SCHOOL AT ALL AGES. BUT IF YOU CAN STOP ROSE-ANN STARTING HER PLACE, I WON'T NEED TO GO TO SCHOOL, AND THINGS CAN STAY JUST THE WAY THEY ARE. THE WAY THINGS ARE, SELINA, ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH. YOU DO WANT TO LEARN HOW TO LIVE PROPERLY, DON'T YOU? YES, I DO. BUT THIS SCHOOL... IS IT FAR AWAY? NOT TOO FAR. I'LL BE WITH STRANGERS. THEY'LL LAUGH AT ME. I DON'T THINK THEY WILL. ISN'T THERE SOMETHING ELSE WE CAN DO? I THINK THIS IS BEST. WILL I STILL BE ABLE TO SEE YOU? OF COURSE YOU WILL. OH... OK? OK. YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU FIXED ME SOME LUNCH. OK, GORDON. COME ON. JEEPERS, I NEARLY FORGOT. THERE'S SOMETHING I GOT TO GET. I'M GOING TO MISS MY LUNCH. OH, COME ON. I HOPE IT'S STILL OK. DEFY ME AGAIN, WOULD YOU, YOU LITTLE TRAMP? WAIT A MINUTE. OH, AND AS FOR YOU, I GOT A GOOD MIND TO CALL A COP. FROM WHAT I HEAR, THAT WOULDN'T BE SUCH A BAD IDEA. WHAT? WAIT TILL I GET YOU HOME, BLABBERMOUTH. LET ME GO! SELINA! NO! [MOANING] IT'S ALL RIGHT. BE QUIET. IT'S ALL RIGHT. TAKE YOUR FILTHY HANDS OFF MY KID! LEAVE HER ALONE, MRS. D'ARCEY. DID YOU SEE THAT? HE STRUCK ME. HE STRUCK ME! YOU CAN'T GET AWAY WITH THIS. THAT'S MY DAUGHTER HE'S GOT THERE. THAT'S MY DAUGHTER! AIN'T ANYBODY GOING TO DO NOTHING? SELINA! YOU COME BACK HERE! [BREATHING HEAVILY] YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU'RE DOING? YOU FOOL, YOU BLIND LITTLE FOOL, COME BACK HERE. YOU... Rose-Ann: SELINA! SELINA! SELINA! WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON? DON'T YOU CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO THE KID? SHE AIN'T A KID ANYMORE, ROSE-ANN. [DOOR UNLOCKS] SELINA? YES, GORDON? WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THE DARK? OH, SORRY. IT'S OK. OLE PA'S ALWAYS DOING THAT. WELL, IT'S ALL SET. THEY CAN TAKE YOU TONIGHT. THEY'RE SENDING A WHOLE SCHOOL BUS FOR YOU. THEY'LL CALL WHEN IT'S ON ITS WAY. [WHISTLING] OH, I PUT THE KETTLE ON. I THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE SOME COFFEE. THEY WANTED TO KNOW HOW OLD YOU WERE. I TOLD THEM 18. THAT'S RIGHT, ISN'T IT? YES. APRIL 23. LOOK, YOU MUST-- [TELEPHONE RINGS] [RING] GORDON RALFE. YES, THAT'S RIGHT. Gordon: THANK YOU. YES, SHE'LL BE READY. THAT WAS THE SCHOOL. THE BUS IS ON ITS WAY. ALREADY? WHEN WILL I BE ABLE TO SEE YOU? OH...I'LL BE AROUND. ARE YOU MARRIED ALREADY? WHAT DO YOU MEAN, ALREADY? I MEAN--I MEAN, I THOUGHT-- WELL, YOU'VE NEVER SAID, UM... YOU'VE NEVER SAID YOU WERE MARRIED, AND I WAS THINKING IF YOU WERE ALREADY MARRIED, THEN THAT'S WHY-- I'M SORRY. I SHOULDN'T HAVE ASKED. PLEASE BE TOLERANT. IT'S ALL RIGHT. YOU CAN ASK ME ANYTHING. NO, I AM NOT MARRIED. I'VE NEVER BEEN MARRIED. THEN WHY DON'T YOU BE-- WHY DON'T I ASK YOU TO MARRY ME? NOT ASK, JUST MARRY. YOU DON'T HAVE TO ASK. COME. WE'LL TAKE THESE INSIDE. THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT BEFORE THE BUS ARRIVES. I'M NOT WRONG, AM I? YOU DO LOVE ME, DON'T YOU? OF COURSE. GORDON, YOU'VE GONE AWAY FROM ME. EVERYTHING IS CHANGING. NO, I HAVEN'T. COME ON. I THOUGHT YOU'D GONE AWAY. SIT DOWN. SELINA, THERE ARE MANY KINDS OF LOVE. MOST OF THEM HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH MARRIAGE. YOU MEAN YOU DON'T WANT TO MARRY ME? I BELIEVE THERE ARE REASONS WHY IT WOULDN'T WORK OUT. BECAUSE OF MY BEING BLIND? BECAUSE OF WHERE I COME FROM? SELINA, YOU'LL MEET MANY NEW PEOPLE, MEN AND WOMEN. YOU WILL SEE LOTS OF THINGS DIFFERENTLY. AND AFTER A TIME, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TELL-- WE'LL BOTH BE ABLE TO TELL WHETHER WHAT WE FEEL FOR EACH OTHER HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH MARRIAGE. HOW LONG IS ALL THIS GOING TO TAKE? LET'S SAY A YEAR FROM TODAY. A YEAR? A YEAR'S FOREVER. I COULDN'T HOLD OUT LONGER THAN A WEEK. A YEAR IS NOT FOREVER, SELINA. NOW, YOU LISTEN TO ME FOR A MINUTE. THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT ME. I KNOW EVERYTHING I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT YOU. I LOVE YOU. I KNOW YOU'RE GOOD AND KIND. I KNOW YOU'RE COLORED-- WHAT'S THAT? AND I THINK YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL. BEAUTIFUL? MOST PEOPLE WOULD SAY THE OPPOSITE. WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW YOU. [DOORBELL BUZZES] IT'S TIME TO SAY GOOD-BYE, SELINA. OH, GORDON, DO I REALLY HAVE TO GO? YES, DARLING. FOR AWHILE. HOW DID YOU LEARN ABOUT ME? ROSE-ANN SAW US TOGETHER YESTERDAY. [KNOCK ON DOOR] YOU WANT ME TO COME WITH YOU? AND HAVE TO SAY GOOD-BYE AGAIN? MISS SELINA D'ARCEY? SHE'S READY.
