Back to back 3 super-hit songs are waiting for you. Stay tuned and listen to those songs. You are listening to Radio Mirchi 98.3 FM, and this is sizzling hot.

Sit down. Anyone dare make a sound, I'll kill you. Anyone make a sound, none of you will be alive. Put it inside, come on hurry up. Please, please... I beg you. - Give me your phone. - Please... When we already have enough problems, why did you bring her along? We need her till we cross the city limits. Beat her up! Hey... What are you doing? Do you still want to keep her? Naveeth, shoot her now! 'Yenni Thuniga' [Think and dare] You seem to be in a romantic mood in the morning itself, Mr.Needhi? The election is coming up in 5 months. Spending time with you will be difficult after that. I will be busy with party meetings, propaganda and election duties. Don't mistake my concern. People are having a different say. They are saying that I will not get a seat, is it? Yes. I have made certain plans to snub them. Just wait and watch! Since you came into my life, I might even become the chief minister. Hmm. Hereafter, avoid singing in party meetings and maintain your dignity. You are the most handsome minister, But they target you mercilessly. You are talking about the memes, right? It's pronounced as "meems". Yeah, that's what I meant! After I win this election, my first duty will be to ban Whats app, Facebook and Twitter. My wife! Then who am I? You are my sweetheart. My heart is a temple and sunrise is a melody! Yes. Darling, what happened? Sir. Sir. Sir, a group of 5 people had come with weapons. All of them were wearing skull masks. So identities were ruled out. They have harassed the public. Moreover, they have taken the CCTV footage with them. Also, we have a sad news... Mambalam SI Ravi, had come here coincidentally, and they shot him dead, too. They killed two customers in the shop, kidnapped a girl at gun point, and escaped from here. Even this shop's watchman can give me these details. Have you found anything new? No, sir. Where is the shop owner? They stole everything! Those rascals looted everything. He is going to kill me. I'll call you back. Boss! An unexpected mishap has occurred. Please forgive me! Forgive me. Boss! Suddenly they entered with guns, shot 3 of them, and stole all the gold and diamonds. I struggled a lot to stop them, but I failed miserably, boss. How come they spared you? They killed so many people, but why did they spare you? Are you guys planning something behind my back? Sir, how can you accuse us like this? We don't have such a cheap mentality. Mind your words. Son of Arunagiri... I have lost 2000 crores. If I come to know you were behind this loot, I'll burn down your whole family. Did you inform the police about anything else other than jewels and cash? No, boss. I haven't revealed anything. Brother... AC wants to talk to you immediately. He is waiting for you. Sir, we have a good news. The girl who was kidnapped by them and shot at, is still alive. Where is she? I feel so helpless. Narmadha! 'Government Public Hospital' - Take care of him. - Sure, sir. Good morning sir! Sir! Huge robbery has taken place in your area, do you think it was preplanned? Many crimes are happening continuously. When will you nab the criminals? They have looted jewels and cash worth crores of rupees. When will you nab the burglars? While elections are scheduled in 5 months, do you think such a big incident will affect your political party? Will you give compensation to the victims, sir? I have recommended the government to provide compensation of 10 lakhs rupees each for the people who lost their lives. I didn't regard this as their personal loss, but as my personal loss. We will find the criminals soon. This way, sir. Will she survive? She is in critical condition. Bullet has lodged 3 inches deep inside her neck. In fact, it's a miracle that she is still alive. While operating to remove the bullet, even if it deviates by a millimeter, she might end up dead. If we remove the bullet, will she be able to talk? Do you have enough facilities here to treat her? Sorry, sir. We don't have enough facilities here. Is Gem hospital good enough? It's a good hospital, sir. It's actually the best hospital in the city. If you treat her in that hospital, she might survive. Discharge her immediately and transfer to that hospital. Sure, sir. Sir! Greetings! Greetings is the only word you utter correctly. Sir! Who asked you to agree to a compensation of 10 lakh rupees? They are mercilessly attacking our party. I didn't know any other way to shut them up. If there were no representatives from our side, we would face trouble. That's why I came to the spot. Do whatever is needed. But avoid blabbering in front of the press and public, and leave the spot as soon as possible. Ok, sir. Sorry, Mr. Kathir. I feel sorry to investigate you in this situation. If you can remember even a small detail about them, it will be helpful. Do you remember the vehicle they used, or who were inside the vehicle went it left the place? Do you remember anything at all? I dropped Narmadha in front of the shop and went to the parking lot to park my bike. I attended to my friend's call then. I must have spoken to him for a few minutes. When I came out of the parking lot after my call, I saw a Maroon colour van leaving the place. It was so sudden that I couldn't see who drove it or how many people were inside. Didn't you hear any gun shots? I heard it. But... since it was so sudden, I couldn't identify it as a gunshot. After that when I went inside and saw what had happened... nothing made sense. Later... Only in the hospital... Don't they really know who did it or is your department as usual trying to save someone? They have investigated everyone in that shop, in every possible angle. We couldn't get any information. That's why... they spoke to Kathir, in the hope of getting some information, but the case didn't move any further. However, a case like this will usually be treated as a pending case. Since minister is pressurising to solve this case, I think they'll definitely find the criminals. Look, Neethimanikam... don't tarnish your father's reputation. Do you know why they raided your place? Party leaders have clearly decided not to let you compete in this election. In the coming election, Rajendran will compete instead of you. He is ready to afford even thousand crores to compete in the election. If he manages to win that bargain, sure he will atleast get hold of two minister posts. One more thing... When they raided your house, the second time, I heard they didn't seize anything. Then, it means you have safely hidden the valuables somewhere else. Guard it carefully. If he is ready to offer 1000 crores, add 100 or 200 crores to it, and try to compete in the election. Hey!!! 2000 crores. Rascals! Hey!!! Rajendra! Will you ever be a candidate? Needhi, you are so useless! We undertook small projects till now, but the project we are going to undertake now is huge. Highly risky too! In this project we are going to loot... Diamonds! Totally 10 pieces. The value of a single piece is, 200 crores. So, total worth of these 10 pieces are, 2000 crores. Actually these diamonds were carved out of Catoca region, Angola, in 2008. Later, it was traded a couple of times, and then in 2010, it was exhibited in Spain AWDC. A mafia group had attempted to loot it from there. But that attempt was a failure. Soon after, these diamonds were exhibited in an auction, in Chicago. Yet again, the same mafia group attempted to steal the diamonds. The man heading the mafia group is Sam. His job is to steal the diamonds proposed by Chicago's Al Capone clan. He had smuggled diamonds in Belgium and London. However, he missed stealing the diamonds exhibited in the Chicago auction. An Indian minister illegally auctioned these diamonds. One of our countrymen could afford so much money? Maybe because he is a minister. It's him who has given us the project of looting the diamonds. We got an information, that the minister has hidden the diamonds in a jewellery shop in Chennai. It's a jewellery shop in T.Nagar, Nithila jewellers. All is fine, assume we have succeeded. How much is our share? Each one of us get 10 lakhs. Okay. In addition, all the jewels that you loot from the shop, belongs to you. Sounds good. Deal, dude. When? We have to plan it. Whats you plan look like? Yes, this is the team. Let me introduce them to you. This is Pandi, my friend from Madurai. Greetings Bro! He has got local expertise and we can use that. This is Naveed. He is a sharp shooter and never missed his target. Hello Meet Justin, he is a getaway driver. Hi sir! Last but not the least, ah Billy! He is a computer hacker by profession and he is from Mumbai We need about aah, 10 days to pull this off 10 Days? You have to understand its pretty tough around here. We will have to strategize. I don't care how you do it. I want results. Do whatever is necessary... and ping me once you are done. We will try to do our best. Move aside. Go back. Sir, sir. Move aside. Look, how they are pressurising us. Have you still not received any information? They had planned the escape route efficiently. I have formed a search team to trace them. So, you don't have any worthwhile information for me? If we don't catch the burglars, it will be a big shame for the ruling party. Elections are nearing, CM is furious, and you say you have no evidence. Sorry, sir. If the girl regains her consciousness, we will definitely get some clue. She might remember their names, faces or any such details. Hey... I'll bring the girl back from her deathbed, and you will investigate her effortlessly, is it? I'm mighty thrilled about it, Mr. Shanmuganathan. Super. Have you received your salary yet? Withdraw money from the ATM. Have you heard about Masala vada? Buy that and spoon feed each other. Do you atleast know how to use the pin number at the ATM? - Doctor. - Yeah. You come here. Is she alive? She is alive, sir. I have a doubt that you continuing her treatment even after her death, just to loot money from me. That's not the case, sir. Can you give us a moment, please? Needhi... You have to trust us. She will definitely talk. Stolen goods are not of meagre value. My entire political life depends on the girl's survival, only if she regains her consciousness, and gives some clue to catch the burglars. I have helped you in many ways. Try and do your best. You said that the chief doctors are coming from Mumbai to treat her. Have they arrived? They have arrived and are on the way from the airport. They are not coming from Mumbai, they are from AIIMS, Delhi. As if I care. Her health conditions are improving. Her breathing level is good. Just that she hasn't regained consciousness. Don't worry. She'll be fine. Delhi AIIMS doctors have been called to treat her. So there is a chance of her getting better. Why are you guys calling me one by one? Dude, we saw your crush yesterday. What's wrong with you guys? I'm not joking, she looks stunning and at different level. Has she shifted her residence? 2nd or 3rd floor? - Kathir! - Are you being sarcastic? I have packed lunch for you. - I'm leaving. - Okay. - We shall have dinner together. - Okay. Hello Kathir! You were blabbering something... She was furiously staring at us. Does she still hold a grudge? I'm sure she was looking for you. Thank God, I didn't come yesterday. Don't waste my time just because you have free outgoing calls. You too saw Narmadha yesterday? I saw my future wife yesterday. Who is your future wife? Narmadha. You're exaggerating too much, dude. I clicked many pictures of her at the function yesterday. She looked stunning. I'll share her photos in Whats app. Then you tell me how my girl looks. Do I have to give a feedback on your photos too? Do as you wish. This is the product that we're going to launch in the next 6 months As you can see there is so much of work to be done As you can see we're just at the prototype level She was so smitten by me during college days. I didn't understand her feelings and humiliated her. I feel very guilty now. I should atleast ask sorry. What do you mean you should ask sorry? What else do you want to ask her? Why do you question a question? I just want to apologise. Hey, I have a doubt. If a guy makes a mistake and apologises, will you accept the apology or make a huge fuss about it? It depends upon the mistake you make. Oh! I need that coffee now! Hey! I behaved like a kid and complained about her to the Principal. They expelled her from college. Poor her! I was a terrible person during those days. Still you are a terrible person, brother. Why? Even last week, you defamed a fellow employee to the M.D, and had him dismissed. Me? Yes. Let's not talk about that. I'll talk to you later. How come you realize your mistake, only when it pertains to a girl? We certainly should talk about this. Okay, you keep talking. She is not beautiful all of a sudden. She was beautiful during our college days too. I didn't heed her, and missed her. What are you saying? What were you doing during college days instead of admiring beautiful girls? I attended college in the morning. In the evening, I attended coaching class. I used to watch WWE, Smackdown, Scooby Doo and Chin-Chan, so I didn't notice her. Why didn't you watch Popeye and Tom & Jerry shows? You spoke to me, and ended up smashing your car. Tell me, dude? Do you know whereabouts of Narmadha? Why are you suddenly asking about Narmadha? Get hold of her number and find out where she'll be in the evening. Do you think a SI is a jobless person? I'm a Sub Inspector. I'm here at IG office, and I'm piled up with work. Fabricate a story and get permission. Being a police, I'm sure you know how to manage. That's why I'm saying I can't lie. You want me to believe you? Make sure you come in the evening. If anything goes wrong, we shall escape using your reputation, ok? - What? - Come soon. - Bye, bye. - Hey! - Hi. - Hey. Dude, usually we find couples in the park, now each guy has two girlfriends. When are we going to join this world? I think I'll end up marrying a guy. But, we have to mind the law too. What's your opinion? What's your opinion? Why would Narmadha come here? Maybe she is in a relationship? Why did you want to meet Narmadha? I wanted to apologise. - Don't make me feel sorry for myself. - Not at all, don't worry. Look there! "Oh beauty...!" Why is she reading here? Maybe she has an arrear? Not everyone can become a police like me. - Can you give me 2 minutes? - Sure. Can you wait for me there? "Oh beauty...!" "I thought of you as my soul" "Yearned to hear your words of pearl" "Talk to me, O girl!" Don't cut the trees. Let's save the trees. Don't cut the trees. Don't cut the trees. Let's save the trees. Why have you people gathered here? You don't have trees outside your house. Even the streets you live in don't have trees. There are no trees in your surroundings. We are yearning for a shade. We are yearning for some fresh air. We have come in search of this park, only because we get it here. Only amidst you, to the people who know its importance, we can create an awareness. Don't cut the trees. Let's save the trees. She is organising a protest. Is she the same Narmadha? She is involved in protests, so that she can participate in Big Boss. Don't mind. People engage in shameless acts in the name of love. Even for that, a shade is needed. Save the Trees! What are you doing here? Police are getting involved. - Don't create unnecessary trouble. - Which is unnecessary trouble? Are they going to make lathi charge? - Head charge. - What does it mean? They won't leave unless they collect Rs. 100 per person. If I stay, they might even collect it from me. Let's go! What about my apologies? Apologies? If you apologise now, she'll give you ten saplings to plant. - Are you ready to plant it? - Yes. Maybe you'll even end up doing that, let's go. Let's go. This is Khakhi T-shirt... but it smells horrible. Hey, Saravana! You asked me to come to the park, but you're waiting here? Actually we came to meet you, but after hearing your speech, we decided to leave. You heard it? Then you too plant 4 saplings. Please leave me out of this! Not me, but that gentleman wanted to meet you. Hi! Hey, you wanted these snacks, didn't you? He offered since she is here. How are you? We have not seen each other for a long time, isn't it? It was me who told Saravanan that I want to meet you. I wanted to apologise to you. Just that... 4 years back, I troubled you a lot during college days. So, I was feeling guilty. That's why, I wanted to meet you... Hmmm... 4 years back? Yeah, 4 years back. I'm really sorry. You seemed totally different, tying those ribbons across your head and shouting slogans. You looked totally awesome. Is she disregarding your apology? Hey... She would've reached home by now. It's ok. He is acting so cool. (TV news) Am I guessing correctly, Kathir? About what, dad? Are you in love? Dad... How did you find out? You have entered the kitchen for the first time. You are sitting on the counter too. You don't have mobile in your hand. On top of all this... you seem totally confused. Yes, dad. I'm confused. Is she your colleague? She is not my colleague. Do you remember the girl who got expelled from college because of me? - Yeah. - Narmadha. She is the one. Are you confused whether she loves you or not? I'm confused whether I love her or not. Guys of your age, have already been in 4 to 5 relationships, 2 to 3 break-ups, and another 4 to 5 relationships after that. I brought you up as a responsible guy. So, I was worried, that you'll end up being a naive boy. I was concerned that I would end up giving tips for your first night. - Dad! - It's not a problem at all. Love happened on its own. Don't confuse yourself and get on with the proposal, or someone else will propose to her. Wash your hands, let's eat. No, dad. I'm not hungry. I'll skip. Then it's definitely love. I have full faith in you. Make it work, okay? Don't open the liquor shop. Don't open the liquor shop. Stop misleading the students. Stop misleading the students. Quit drinking alcohol. Hi! Save lives. Stop misleading the students. Quit drinking alcohol. What are you doing here? I decided to accept your love. Huh? You proposed me during college days. I didn't realise your worth and missed you. But now... I have decided to accept your love. - Are you an IT guy? - Yes. - How much is your salary? - 1 lakh rupees. If I do overtime, I get paid approximately 1.5 lakhs. Company provides pick up and drop. I have incentives and few other perks too. For me, they are constructing a new... Sorry! They are constructing a new apartment for us. Then... you are a corporate slave. They have turned you into a geek. Geek? When I saw you being a nerd in college, I guessed that you would end up working for someone. Do you think that I still love you? Thinks too much about himself, and coolly talks about accepting my love. - Why are you protesting? - Save lives, don't mislead students. Do you think the country will improve, if you close this shop? Why would women like you come to the wine shop? You are fortunate I'm wearing my underpants today. By uttering a single word, you have captured my soul Why are you abusing my customers? These hooligans are you customers? You destroy so many families and yet you call yourself the shop owner and them as your customers. Smooth talk won't help, go and thrash them. Abolish the liquor shop which kills people. Quit drinking alcohol which kills people. Why did you throw a log when we were protesting peacefully? This country belongs not only to you but to me as well. So I'll follow you everywhere and protest with you. Why is the shop still open? Close it! Don't use the protest as an excuse to follow me. These guys are following you too. They are my comrades. I'm also a comrade. Hi! I'm comrade Kathiravan! Comrade Kathiravan! Doesn't it rhyme well? From now on, my protest will continue for the sake of this society. Why is the shop still open? You can protest or even dance, but don't follow me. Should I dance too? "Oh my precious, I'll be there for you." "I'll be there for you forever." "Oh my precious, I'll be there for you." "I'll be there for you forever." "I'll be dazed if you move closer to me and glance at me." "If your eyes tries to communicate, I might get lost." "If your breath enfolds me I'll become immensely delicate." "What will become of me?" "How will I ever live without you?" Narmadha... - I have resigned the job. - Huh? You were skeptical about me being a geek. So I enquired where I can wear casuals, attended interview and got selected too. I thought of saying such things to you. If you continue to follow me, I'll end up insulting you. "Without disregarding and smashing my dreams" "Accompany me without disrupting my soul." "Won't you realise that you are my whole world?" "Tell me a way to make you mine" "Hey gorgeous, you are enough for me to make this lifetime worthwhile." "Hey dear, why don't you confess your love?" "You are my life." Youngsters are involved in such noble causes, leave them alone. You too belong to the same group right? - Get in. - Why should I get in? - Get in. - Why should I get in, sir? Sir, please let me go. I have my tuition class. Sister... You are going to get beaten up. I know nothing about protest. I came as bodyguard to her. Tell them. We usually hear about such incidents in TV and newspaper feel sorry for them, and get on with our life casually, but when I saw the blood in real life, I was so terrified. The people who visited this shop, must have had lot of dreams. They shattered it all in a matter of minutes. Those sinners Brother... Did the police find out anything? No, brother. They are still searching for them. Only the wrongdoers, do everything perfectly. All the others work for namesake. They committed such a huge crime, and yet they'll be leading a happy life in some corner of the world, right? Still they have their meal peacefully without any conscience. So is it done? Seriously? Lets plan to pick it up and send the boys. - In India? - Chennai Lets call Madhan now. He is not picking up. What is he doing? Is he avoiding our call? Lets give it another try I have a bad feeling about this. Ok! Let's call him again. Nope Check please! Madhan, what sort of a city is this? We have CCTV cameras in each and every street. Hmm. We get caught even if we steal a bulb which is 40 rupees. We have to loot in crores. Hence, we have to be extra careful. Around this jewellery shop, there are approximately 28 CCTV cameras. Why don't we rent a shop, dig an underground tunnel, and easily enter the shop. Did you watch many English movies in prison? There are 10 cameras installed inside the jewellery shop. When I hacked these cameras, I noticed that weekdays are very crowded. Towards the evening the crowd inflow increases. If I know how many securities are there I can surely shoot them from a distance of 100 metres. I don't want any casualties. Don't kill anyone. We don't need any unwanted media and police attention. We don't need that kind of a problem. I think risks are high at night. Unloading of goods in nearby shops, police, lorries and the crowd. This doesn't feel right. So... Day time is the best. If we have to pick a day... Sunday between 9.30 to 10.30 am would be an apt time. We should enter and loot the diamonds. That is the plan. Fantastic plan! We shall execute your plan. What do you say guys? What's that paper? I met with the jewellery shop's watchman, and collected some details. On the day of robbery, totally 27 people were present in the shop. This paper has details about them. Just want to check if I can get any information from them. What is the point of you meeting them? Then? You want me to ignore it? Police are probing the case, isn't it? If found, what will the police do? Most of the murders happen during a burglary. Even innocent women, elders and kids are not spared. To loot 1 or 2 sovereigns of gold, people are mercilessly killed. How many such burglars were caught? Even if you arrest, will you be able to hang them? They will easily offer a bribe and come out of the jail the very next day. You'll happily send them away and carry on with your day to day life. That's it, right? I understand your feelings. We ourselves are finding hard to solve this case. How will you deal with it all alone? Hey! Before you guys get hold of them, I'll surely find and destroy them. Are you joking? Who is joking? I visited her today. She is hardly breathing. I'm not sure if she will survive or not. Kathir! Then... you have to take the opposite route. I don't understand. I'll tell you what to do. I shall suggest a place tomorrow. Begin your enquiry from there. Only if you enquire these guys, you might get some lead. I have reached, buddy. Can you see a guy with coloured hair? I will mercilessly thrash you. Yeah. His name is Jimiki. Enquire him. Who is Jimiki? - It's me. - I want to talk to you. What is it about? I want to discuss about a personal matter. What personal matter? Hey, you continue the game. Brother. Brother. Brother, can you wait for a moment? Brother... Hey, Mani, Sekar, Kumar...help me. He is chasing me. Hey, why are you chasing him? I have to enquire some details from him. I'll leave after enquiring him. You can't enquire any details, get going. Why are you still talking to him dude? Look how innocent his face looks.... What bro... You should have told me earlier, that you are a friend of Saravanan. We could have avoided the chaos. I was so terrified. Saravanan said that you might know the guys involved in such burglaries. I end up in jail for petty thefts, bro. However, you are enquiring about a huge heist. Who asks you to agree to such thefts? How can I reveal those details to you, bro? Please, tell me. If you do so, it will be helpful for me. There is a person named Maari in this area. He asks us to surrender voluntarily. Then, he himself bails us out. Can you take me to him? We ourselves can't meet him. If he allots some work, we simply carry it out. You can try and meet him. He might help you. Please don't reveal my name. Who are you? I have come to meet brother Maari. Did brother ask you to come? No, but I want to meet him. What for? I have to discuss an important issue. What do you want to discuss? Don't create a scene. Get going. Don't you understand? Leave now. The purpose of our gathering today, is to plan a protest on 23rd of this month, to question the whereabouts of 650 crores. 650 crores? What are you talking about, comrade? Every year, a water management scheme is being introduced. They plunder crores of rupees. However, when the rain water floods our house we get stranded on the terrace of our house and beg for food and water. Atleast we have a terrace in our house. Think about the situation of the people who don't even have a house. What about my situation? What are you doing here? I want an answer. Can you get out? Today, I have no work outside. Kathir, can you get out or not? If you clear my doubts, we can very well go out. Don't torture me. Just leave this place. Sir, what are you doing? Can you get out of here? Sorry. Please, leave sir. Sorry, madam. - Narmadha, Are you okay? - Hmm. Kathir! I was humiliated the same way in front of everyone, in college. You never felt bad for me. However, when I realised that your feelings were hurt, I couldn't bear to see it even for a minute. I love you so much. I used to dress, and beautify myself only to impress you. I felt that I should live only for you. However, the rejection I faced because of you... made my life worthless. I was unable to face even my parents. I was holed up inside a room for a long time. Hey, don't cry. I'm not a worthy guy. Only now, I have come out of that shell and have changed as a person. I like this life better, where I get to live for others. You were saying that you work in IT. I already knew everything about you. I watch your routine and activities on a daily basis, because, love cannot appear and disappear as it pleases. Love is trust. It remains the same forever. I don't understand. You are such an idiot. I love you. Do you love me? Really? I suffered for 4 years because of you, but you made me to concede right away. You defeated me. What do you mean? Leave it. Who did I lose to? It's just you. "Oh my darling!" "You tear me apart" "and entangle me." "You tear me apart" "Oh my darling!" "You tear me apart," "and entwine me into the core of your heart." "I get lost in you without a chance." "Oh my darling, tell me now." "Why did you give me wings and let me fly?" "Even the sky isn't enough to soar high." "Enchanted moments of fantasy begins right away" "By the time I button- up my shirt, my desire soars sky high." "Your compassion enfolds me in breath of love." "Your very being blooms with love in my wilderness." "Oh my sweetheart!" "You tear me apart and entangle me." "I was wandering like a bird hovering over a mirage" "Your passion quenched my thirst for love." "Like raindrops dancing in strands your love has deluged my soul" "Strands of hair on your forehead, Inquisitive eyes." "Bronzy skin, Crooked teeth," "child- like face, pierces my heart." "The flame of love lit after ages" "seems to be enough forever." "You sweep me off my feet..." "Oh my sweetheart!" "You tear me apart and entangle me." "I get lost in you without a chance." "Oh my darling..." "You entwine me into the core of your heart." "Oh my darling..." Hello, sir. Sit down. I thought his presence will be helpful to discuss things. So, I asked your dad to come along. Can we have a cup of coffee? - Bring coffee for all of us. - Sir... Dad drinks only tea. Oh! I saw them talking on the road. Narmadha told me that they were in love. I didn't want them to roam around like that. Hence, I thought we can sort it out at home. Sure, sir. I wanted to ask you... Which caste do you belong to? I don't think it's a such terrible question to ask. We can't allow our daughter to get married to someone from an unknown caste. Sir, what I'm trying to say is... Dad...let me talk. I usually get up at 5 in the morning, do yoga and go to the gym. There are some stray dogs in my street, and I feed them biscuits whenever I can. My dad usually soaks raw rice in water and asks me to spread it on the terrace. Crows will happily feed on them. My office timings are usually from 9 am to 5 pm. I meet your daughter before and after my office hours. You could've asked me any such questions. Or else, you could've asked if I'll keep your daughter happy. However, you are enquiring about my caste and religion. Do you think it's fair? Sir, it might not be a concern for you, but we are bounded by a structure. We have specifications even in the mangalsutra that our women wear. We can't let one mingle with the other. I don't know about such specifications. Everyone should love each other and enjoy their lives to the fullest. I will take good care of your daughter, sir. Another important thing... In future, if we have to make a decision about our daughter or son's wedding, your daughter will not be in the kitchen preparing coffee. Instead, she'll sit beside me and make important decisions about their marriage. Let's not over think, sir. My son's happiness is of utmost importance to me. I'll be happy, if you consent to their marriage. I know you'll be happy about it, but I can't make any hasty decisions. Dad, what's your final say on this? I'm just pointing out what is the right thing to do. Can't you hear? Kathir, I don't think this will work out. Let us get married in the registrar office. Narmadha! What are you saying? What else do you expect, mom? He is not keen on getting us married, so he is speaking pointlessly. Sir...! Sir, wait for a moment. Dear... Why are you arguing with your dad? I can't help it, I don't like his attitude. Narmadha, please convince your dad. 22nd of this month is an auspicious day. We can plan their wedding on that date. Coming Sunday we will be purchasing jewellery. If you can join us, we shall purchase the mangalsutra too. Good morning, sir. Two wheeler parking is over there. - Oh, okay. - Left side. Come here for a second. Come here. I have an important thing to say... Bloody hell! Where are the diamonds? I don't know. I don't know. Where are the diamonds? I swear I don't know anything about the diamonds. Tell me where it is? I'll shoot you if you don't tell me. Don't shoot me. Don't shoot me. Open it, open it! Come on, open it. Don't take anything. Please leave. If my boss comes to know of this, he will kill me. Leave me. Give that to me. I beg you, give that to me. Don't break it. Don't break it. There is nothing inside that. We already have enough problems, why did you bring her along? Naveeth, shoot her now. Give me 2 minutes, yaar Hi Sam Good job. Glad to hear its all done well. Not so sure about that Sam. There is high tension and a citywide manhunt for us. I'm sure you are aware there was a bit of bloodshed right? Diamonds are worth every drop of blood my friend. Come on, clean up the mess and get me the loot. Sam, please wait. I'm sure you have seen our headlines Ok.. listen. Be careful and make sure its safe. Sure Sam! Will get it done. He got it? Yep! Job is done. We should have it next week. You can take all the jewels that we have here. Take it! That's a lot man. This will look beautiful on my wife. This must be very expensive. Everything looks fantastic. Billy, Billy! You are going to be rich, dude. What are you searching for? Where... Where are the diamonds? Diamonds, huh? Madhan, you were the one to steal the diamonds. Yes, I was the one to steal it, but it's missing. What are you saying? Search for it. Where did it disappear? Where did it vanish? Search properly. Don't get agitated. - Madhan, think patiently. - Guys, search properly. Did we miss it somewhere else? No... I'm sure I took it. We never saw the diamonds. Only you stole it. Think hard, Madhan. It's not a joke. Where did it go? Madhan... don't mistake me. Did you really steal the diamonds? I was the one who stole it. How will I miss it? Gone! Everything's gone. Team is ready. You can make more profit than you had imagined. It's highly risky too. 2000 crores. 10 lakhs for each of us. Between 9.30 and 10:30 am would be the apt time. Diamonds are missing. I have no idea how it went missing. Hey, Muni. - Muni... - What brother? Tell me. Brother... After hearing all the details from you, I don't think any local men have done it, as they have looted distinctly without leaving an evidence. Local men are not capable enough to pull this off. You should go in search of a well educated burglar. Those burglars are in trend now. I don't know any such person. I thought you might be able to help me. You even said that they have shot down 3 people. Earlier, only few men knew how to use a gun. Now, it has become so common that everyone is carrying one. So... instead of finding the shooter, try and get hold of the person who supplies guns to the shooter. As far as I know, two of them supply guns in Chennai. One of them is Selvam, and he is in jail. Who is the other one? That crazy guy, Anthony. Yes, Anthony. Go and meet him. He is a crazy fellow. Dimwit. However, if you meet him, I'm sure you will get the information you are looking for. - Hey, Prasad. - Yes, brother. Take him to meet Anthony. Okay, brother. I shall leave, brother. Brother, one minute... After taking so much efforts to get hold of them, what do you think you can do to them? They think no one can bust them. Just for the sake of jewels and money they wrecked so many lives. I'll definitely catch them. Their death will be so vicious, that no one will ever dare to commit such crimes again. Few days back, a jewellery shop was looted. Those burglars had used guns. So, I wanted to enquire whether anyone had purchased a gun from you recently. Since he is enquiring about a gun, brother directed him to me, is it? No, Prasad. Business is not thriving like before. Hence, I stopped selling guns and started bullet business. Don't you get it? I meant brothel. Look how I ended up. So, inform your brother, that Anthony business is floundering, and he is in a demeaning state. Also, if anyone like him turns up, tell him not to direct them to me. As I consumed alcohol, I'm not in my right state of mind. I easily get furious too. Anthony, brother believed, that you will help him in some way. Try to understand what am saying. Take him away. Come, let's go. Hey, what do you want? Who did you call now? Why should I tell you? Tell me. Hey, Prasad! Hey!!! Don't create unnecessary ruckus and tangle me up in this mess. Consuming alcohol makes you angry, is it? Hey!!! What are you doing? Put the gun down! - Tell him to divulge about the call. - I will Tell him, put the gun down. - Tell him to reveal the details. - Hey, Anthony! Don't create unnecessary problems. Do you realise what will happen if brother comes to know of this? You better tell him the truth. I'll tell. Few days back, a man named Bhaskar, acquired 4 guns from me. He paid only the advance. He hasn't paid the balance amount yet. It's a huge amount. Whenever I ask him to pay the balance, he evades citing excuses. So, I had a doubt if he is connected to the heist you were talking about. That's why I called him up now. He is not attending my call. Give me his number. Tell me. Sam everyone in the city is talking about the robbery Shoot out has worsened the situation I don't think its the right time to move the diamonds Stop bullshitting. I don't wanna hear any more excuses Where are my diamonds? You know the value of it right? You sure know the value of your life too. I'm gonna need it now. I will meet the deadline Don't worry. I trust you. But, I will be watching you very closely. Sooner you deliver... its better for both of us. When we tracked Bhaskar's phone number, it indicated that he is in Othakadai, Madurai. Turn left. People like him will usually stay at a lodge in the area. I enquired in all the three lodges in that area, and found that he is staying in Jaya lodge. Go to that lodge at once. Stop here. Sir... In which room is Bhaskar staying? - Bhaskar? - Yes. Who are you? Brother asked me to meet him. Just a minute. He is in room 305. You can meet him there. Who is this? Tell me. Leave me. Weren't you involved in the T.Nagar jewellery shop burglary? Tell me. Where are the others? Didn't you buy guns from Anthony? Come on, tell me. Look at this. Look at the centre page. We don't have any connection to the heist you are mentioning. We planned to pull off a heist in Madurai. Like you said, it's true that I acquired a gun from Anthony, but not for the heist you were mentioning. I came to trade a gun for a heist in Madurai. How can you kill someone and make a living out of it? I'm not a murderer as you depict. I trade guns to earn money. That's all. When I was in jail, I came across a guy named Pandi. They bailed him out, paying a huge amount of money. I remember him saying this to the entire mob in the jail. "I will pull off a heist which will make the whole of Tamilnadu tremble." The only major burglary that has happened after he got released, was the one you mentioned. I suspect he is linked with this burglary. Where can I find him? Madhan... They have stolen everything from engine to tyre. They have stolen everything. - Who must have done it? - No idea - Sir, sir! - Come with us. Sir! - Come with us. - Sir. Sir. Sir. Who stole the tyres and all the things that were inside the vehicle? I don't know, sir. Tell me. I don't know, sir. Come on, tell him. He seems like a poor guy. Tell me. Who stole it? Don't be scared. Four North-Indian boys stole it, sir. Where can we find them? They will be in a shed, behind this building, sir. - Is this Pandi's house? - Yes, brother. - Who Are you, brother? - I'm his friend. Please come inside. Sit down, bro. Tell me, brother. What is it about? I want to a discuss few things with him, so ask him to come out. He has gone out of station for his work. Did he say where he was going? I don't know, brother. He never discloses details of his travel. Usually friends like you, take him along. Only when he returns, I'll know the details. With whom did he go? Did he mention anyone's name? Name... He didn't mention anyone's name. However, he promised to bring lots of jewels and cash when he returns. - Can I make coffee for you, brother? - No, it's okay. - Get me a glass of water. - Sure, brother. Where did you come from? Near-by village, Nattarmangalam. Here you go. Thanks. Did he call you? No, he didn't call me. Phone is switched off from the day he left. Is he using the same old number? Yes, the same number. If he calls me, I shall inform him about your visit. What's your name, brother? Bhaskar. Okay. Hey, get up! Tell me. You dare to loot from us. Who took it? Tell me. If you don't speak up, you are going to end up dead. Where have you hidden it? What did you steal from that vehicle? Sir, we didn't steal anything. We only stole the tyres, sir. - Hey, don't lie to us. - What else did you steal? We're telling the truth, sir. We didn't take anything else. This is the money we got from selling those tyres. Doctor! - Tell me, Madhusoodhana? - Hey, Needhi... The girl has regained consciousness. When? Just now. She's even speaking now. Super, dude. Come as soon as possible. I'll be there in five minutes. Teja... What is it, Needhi? Happy news, baby! What happened? The girl who was admitted in the hospital regained consciousness. The way I torture her, the gang and the jewels they stole will automatically return to me. Wow! Madhan, where are you? I found out! Needhimanikam has hidden all the diamonds in Nithila jewellers, located in T.Nagar. Give me two minutes, huh? Is everything fine? I executed everything perfectly. Tell me when should I leave and I'll start immediately. Teja... diamonds are missing. What are you saying, Madhan? Don't joke now. You only stole the diamonds, right? Or did someone else steal it? I only stole it, but I have no idea how it vanished. Madhan, please! Think hard! Try and think hard! We have worked so hard for this. Think well! Please! The girl who was admitted in the hospital has regained consciousness. Is it? Needhimanikam is on the way to hospital to meet her. Let's not mind about her. We found the guys who looted our van and are enquiring them. In a short while we will know where our diamonds are. That's utmost important. Are you an idiot? She has seen you and your team. Even if they get a tiny clue, they'll trace us all one by one, and everyone will be doomed. Okay, what do you want me to do? Kill her immediately. Okay. Hello? She has regained consciousness. Come to the hospital. I'll be there. Madhan sir! There is a girl getting treated at Gem hospital under police custody. - We have to elude the police and kill her. - Okay, Sir. Hey, don't kill him. Let's go. Greetings! Few days back, a shootout and burglary happened in Nithila jewellers, T.Nagar. The girl who was kidnapped by the burglars and shot at, has survived. Her regaining consciousness, is expected to be an important turning point in this case. Niraimathi for Thanthi TV. Police department is hoping to get a lead from her to nab the burglars. Stand back. Sir...sir. Stand back. Please go back. Sorry, madam. We are sorry to enquire you in such a situation. Where is my husband? Kathir!!! Do you know any information about them? Please tell me where my husband is. Do you remember their names, dressing style or the language they spoke? How is my husband's health? Tell me. Sorry, but your husband was killed in the shootout. Don't cry. Please, don't cry. Only if you tell us some details about the burglars, we will be able to investigate the case further. It was only you who travelled with them for a long distance. What's happening? Sir, please be patient. Only now she has learnt about her husband's death. Soon you will kill me. My daughter? I need to see my daughter Gloria now. Please! Your daughter is doing well and she is safe. She is undergoing her treatment. Your mother-in-law is taking care of her. We are also observing her 24/7. I have to go, please! I have to see my daughter Glory. Please! Please don't cry. You have had a near death experience. Our Government and the doctors have struggled to save you. After the enquiry is over, you can definitely meet your daughter. I don't remember anything. I don't know anyone or anything. Please, let me go! Don't you know anything? - Didn't they kidnap you? - Needhi... Don't you remember even one of their faces? I spent 24 lakhs and struggled day and night to bring you back to life. You're coolly saying that you don't remember anything. I'll kill and bury you. Hey! Look at me! Needhi, listen to me. Her health might get affected. Due to media's hype, police have imposed restrictions. We are still waiting outside. I have arranged two shadow police officers to follow the girl without her knowledge. They'll be carrying guns. She will be under our observation, 24/7. Once she relaxes after meeting her daughter, I myself will hand her over to you. What are you saying? I spent lakhs of rupees, struggled day and night to bring her back to life. You're coolly saying that you'll let her go. If something happens to her, you will have an explanation even for that. Sir, she is anxious to see her daughter. We cannot investigate her now. We don't have a choice. Please understand the situation. I'll give you a day's time. If something happens to her, I will kill you. Okay, Sir. I'm more concerned about the truth than her life. Even if you get a tiny loop hole, use that opportunity to kill her. Okay, sir. Officers, I want you to follow Jennifer closely. Yes, sir. Please, don't disturb. Please understand, go back. Move back. No one is allowed to take videos. Open the door, please. Careful. Drive safely. Let's go. Sir, Did you get any information by conducting an enquiry with Jenifer? We have enough information, but we can't share it with the media, because it's confidential. Why are you coming along with me? I have come here only to visit my daughter. I won't go anywhere, I'll be right here. I'm simply following orders from my higher officials. I won't disturb you in any way. Sir, I don't know the reason, but she has come to yet another hospital. Don't give me unnecessary updates. Just give me a call after you kill her. - Do you understand? - Okay, Sir. - I want to see my daughter. - Please Come, madam. What happened? Tell me, what happened? I don't know what happened. She suddenly fainted. Your daughter has a rare medical condition called Sickle Cell anemia. It effects one in a million. To explain the seriousness of this condition, people's blood cells are usually round in shape, but for the people who are affected by this disease, the blood cells will reduce to a crescent shape. There is no immediate cure for this. It may have been passed on genetically. Can you save my daughter? We shall plan the treatment soon, and let you know. Okay, doctor. Pay 8 lakhs immediately. You can pay the remaining amount during the treatment. Sure, doctor. Yes, constable... I'll take care. You don't worry. Hey, come in. You still remember us, is it? Poongodi, look who has come. Don't worry, nothing will happen to your daughter Glory. Doctor said that the treatment will cost more than 15 lakhs. It's just 15 lakhs. Hey... We'll manage somehow. Please don't cry, we are there for you. Be strong and take care of the kid. We'll inform the Parish about it and arrange the money. Don't be afraid. Jesus will help you. Thank you, father. We can sell this and arrange half of the money needed. What will we do for the remaining amount? We shall sell this and start the treatment. For the remaining amount? I will even pledge my life to save our daughter. Sorry, I never thought I will meet you in such a situation. We have planned an important treatment day after tomorrow. Once the treatment starts, will Glory be fine, doctor? Be optimistic. Please sign the consent forms. Here it is. I couldn't even see your face one last time, Michael. The last time I saw you, I wasn't even aware that you were dead. You said you will pledge your life to save our daughter. Is that why you gave up your life? I had a near-death experience. Despite that if I'm alive, it's only for the sake our of daughter, Michael. It's only for the sake of our daughter Glory. Michael! Hey, it's the police! Please... Listen to me... Why did you abduct me? I didn't reveal anything about you. My daughter is admitted in the hospital. She is fighting for her life. Just listen to me for a minute. I won't reveal any details about you to anybody. Please listen to me. Hey, don't run! Hey careful! This girl... She is our daughter. Narmadha. You must have seen her in the jewellery shop. She was supposed to wed the following week. He is the bridegroom. She was very happy to marry the guy she loved. That's when she visited the jewellery shop. Sorry, sir. Everything was happening as planned. Suddenly a guy intervened, beat all of us and abducted her. We tried our best, sir. Police appeared out of nowhere and started firing. He used it to his advantage and escaped with the girl. However, the girl herself didn't know him. He forcefully abducted her. Who are they, how did they look, what were they talking about? Tell me anything, because you were the one who travelled a long distance with them. Police and media are trying to find them. None of them got any lead. Did you see his face? We did, sir. Bring all the phones and CCTV footages that we looted from the jewellery shop. You must be the first person to wish them dead. They have murdered your husband, leaving behind you and your daughter. I'm just like you too. I'm lonesome. Take out the phones of the four people we killed. Okay. Get hold of the CCTV footage before we entered the shop. Don't think you won't face trouble if you don't reveal any details about them. Police will never leave you alone without enquiring about them. Burglars won't spare you, fearing that you might reveal their identity to the police. Please understand. To arrange money for our daughter Glory's surgery expenses, we went to the jewellery shop to sell our jewels. We will surely get cash here. - Welcome, madam, Sir. - Greetings! Where can we weigh the jewels? - In the counter over there, Sir. - Oh, okay. They want to weigh their jewels. Jeni, take out the jewels. We have 12 sovereigns of gold. Okay, sir, what are you planning to buy in exchange? No, sir. We don't want jewels. We are in need of cash. We don't have that option here. Only exchange is available. Sir. We bought these jewels in this shop. Sorry, sir. We don't have that option here. Sir. We bought the jewels here. Please understand, we can't give you cash. - No, I can't do anything. - Sir, please. Balaji, what's the problem? They want cash in exchange for the jewels. - Sir. - Tell me, How Can I help you? Where did you buy this? Sir, we bought the jewels in this shop. Do you have the purchase receipt? No... we don't have it sir. We can't help you without the receipt. Sir, our daughter is admitted in the hospital. We need a huge amount of money for her medical treatment. You say your daughter is suffering. Ask a Government employee to sign a surety. Then I can surely help you. - Please, Sir. - I can't help you in any other way. Jeni, we shall arrange. - Thanks, Sir. - Sure. Thanks. Oh Sorry! - Michael? - Ravi... We came to Nithila jewellers to sell the jewels, and they are asking for surety. Can you come here now? I said I will arrange the money, right? I know, but still we need a huge amount of money. - Does this look good? - Yes madam, IT looks beautiful. Ravi will be coming soon. Can you show me that design? - Doesn't it look great? - Yes, madam. That's when they entered. Come on, come on. Seize all their phones. Get their phones from them. Keep moving! Fast, fast, faster! Keep moving! Security! Security! Sit down. Don't shout. Get their phones from them. Don't make any noise. Give it to me! Please... Please, please...I'm begging you. Please, give it back. - Give it! - Please... Give it to me. Give it to me. Come on, give it to me. I'll kill you! If you make any sound, I'll shoot you. If anyone dares to make a sound, no one will get out of here alive. Michael! Tell me who is inside? It's Ravi. Michael? Michael? Open the door. Open the door. Come on, someone open the door now. Aren't you going to open the door or not? Michael. Michael... Hey... Kathir! Michael... Michael... - Michael... - Come on, now. Michael... One among them pointed a gun at me and brought me out of the shop. Everyone in their gang followed his orders. Let's leave her here. We have killed a policeman, there is a high possibility of them chasing us. We need her, for our safety. Bring her along. Come on, get going. Come on, come on. Narmadha... Narmadha. Hey, Narmadha! What happened? Someone please tell me. Narmadha. Kathir! One second. I'll call the hospital. You'll be fine. Hello? Kathir! Narmadha. Narmadha... Narmadha... Narmadha...what happened? Narmadha... Narmadha... Narmadha... Narmadha... Rajkumar, ask everyone to move aside. Please co-operate. What happened? Sir, excuse me. Narmadha... Please co- operate with us. I understand the situation. Please co- operate. Hello, control room? Sir, please co-operate. Please don't touch the body. Narmadha. This phone belongs to the policeman who we killed. His only relative is his wife, so this is useless. These phones belong to Jenifer and her husband. - We already killed her husband. - Yeah. So we have no use for this either. Did someone call out his name? Madhan, why should we deal with her when we already have enough problems? We need her till we cross the city limits. Madhan! One among them called him by this name. Upon his orders, one of them hit me hard. I don't know what happened after that. Suddenly our van met with an accident with another car. Hearing that sound, I regained consciousness. I was unable to move my hands and legs. A guy got down from the car and created a ruckus. I asked you turn left, but why did you turn right? Hey! - Come out. - Let's talk and settle the issue. Let's talk it out. - Take IT easy. - What is there to talk? We shall settle the problem. - Let's talk it out smoothly. - Who gave you the license? They didn't notice that I was awake. I clearly heard what they were talking about. Hey Madhan, shall I get down and thrash him? Why should we talk to him? We can kill him and leave. Did you see the car's state? We have valuable diamonds in our possession. Why create unnecessary problems? They were talking about some diamonds. - Diamonds? - Hmm. Yes. Madhan told the other guy, that they shouldn't create any unnecessary problems when they have valuable diamonds in their possession. He is demanding 2 lakhs. Hey, give him 2 lakhs. They offered some money to the guy to solve the issue. Come on, get in. Get inside. Here, take it. Take it. Do you think you are a big shot, if you drive an Audi car? Hey Pandi, let's go. You're owning a tattered vehicle and you dare to argue with me? Get going. I think they'll send me back to Madurai jail. Why did you agree to give them 2 lakhs, Madhan? Relax, Pandi. Each and every rupee matters. Even though we got the money out of a loot, we can't afford to waste it. Pandi, just leave it. - Hey! - Sit down. - Don't open that. - Leave it. - Please, Give IT back to me. - Hey, give it! Pandi, get it back from her. Madhan who was in the front seat, asked the guy sitting at the back, to shoot me with a gun. He shot me without thinking twice. Shoot her now. - Shut your mouth and Give it. - Please, Leave me. That's why I told you to get rid of her long back. Shoot her. Kick and shove her on the road. Was he there too? Yes, he was with them. Is he the one? Yes, sir. He wasn't inside the jewellery shop. - Are you sure? - Very Sure. Billy, get hold of the parking lot footage. Madhan, here it is. Pause the video, Billy! Hold it! Madhan, what are you thinking? He is the boyfriend of the girl we killed. I thought this is just a diamond burglary. However, he has changed it into a revenge story. Billy? Using his number, track his current location. - Madhan... - Hmm. Thanikachalam road, Adyar. - Naveeth. - Yes? Kill them both. Okay, Madhan. Take Justin with you and I don't want any mistakes. I will take care. - Make it quick. - Let's go. Looking at the way the minister is getting involved in this case, the diamonds they were mentioning in the van, should belong to him. Hmm. Owner of the jewellery shop is minister's benami. Minister must have thought it to be a safe place to hide his diamonds. Since the diamonds are missing now, he will definitely come back to you, to enquire about it. Tell these details to minister, just the way I say. Hmm. I will make sure, that you will not be harmed either by him or by Madhan in any way. Hey, kill her. Don't be frightened. The police have come. - Send Jeniffer along with them. - Okay, dear. Go on, uncle. You are... father of Narmadha, who was killed in the shootout, isn't it? Yes, sir. TN10W 8164 is your car? Yes, sir. How do you know Jeniffer? Jeniffer is our family friend. When I was driving the car, I heard her crying for help. I was the one to bring her home in my car. Did you see any of those guys? Since it was dark, I couldn't see any of them clearly. We are taking her with us to enquire regarding the jeweller shop case. Please. How is your daughter? She is fine, sir. I know that hospital's authorities personally. I have paid the money. No need to worry about it. - I'll take care of it. - Hmm. Our government has given a cheque for 10 lakh rupees as a compensation for your husband's death. Take it. It would be of help to you. In-return, I need a favour from you. You must know something about the guys who kidnapped you. His name or the city he belongs to? Is he short or tall? Is he fair or dark skinned? Tell me any such details. Even these policemen suggested that we should beat you up, or do something terrible to make you speak the truth. I said it's not necessary. I told them you will understand if we explain the situation. Hey, leave us alone. Teja, sit down. Do I have to tell you separately? Teja... Explain to her patiently, and make her understand. They are threatening you with kind words, isn't it? You don't need to fear after hearing their threats. If you don't know anything, say so. What can they do about it? Media's complete attention is on you. Even if there's a minor scratch on you, they will be answerable. So you can very well say, that you don't know anything. Okay? Darling... Teja, did she say anything? - No, Needhi... - I'll tell you, sir. The men who kidnapped me removed their masks, once boarded the van. Did you see their faces? I saw everyone's face. Only one among them gave orders to the others. I think he is the leader. His name is... What's his name? - Pandi. - Pandi. He ordered everyone around, and everyone followed his orders. He ordered another guy to shoot me, sir. Did he speak at all? He had a Madurai accent. He blabbered that he just came out of the jail. Did he have any identification marks? He had a scar on his face. Scar? This is all I know, sir. - Please, Sir. - That's enough. That's enough. Thank you, Teja. AC, were you listening to her? I need to see that Pandi's face in the next ten minutes. - Contact Madurai control room. - Okay, Sir. Retrieve all the records in the name of Pandi. I have sent an accused details in What's app. Send fax to all the stations in Tamilnadu. He has been recently released from jail. I want complete records about him. Recently, a guy named Pandi was released on bail. Send all his details to the Chennai headquarters. Tell me. Where is your leader Madhan? Tell me. What are you going to do, after finding out? Are you going to end up dead just like your girlfriend? No.6, Vivekanandar street, Gandhi nagar, Adyar. Go on! Face him upfront and try to come back alive. His name is Pandi. He is known by his nick name BandhaPandi. His native is Thiruparankundram. Few years back, he was involved in a theft case in Kerala. In that incident, his face got scarred by a hand sickle. Yes, that's his identification. Even 10 days back, he made a huge ruckus in Tahsildar's office. He was arrested under the section 353. With the help of a lawyer, they had him released on bail. Since he was released on bail, does he come to the station everyday to sign? From the day he got released on bail, he never even came once to sign. When we enquired his wife, she says he is out of town. Have you traced out his number? Last found location is Mattuthavani. That's where he has switched off his phone. I'll send his photo, sir. Is he the one? Yes, sir. He is the one. Teja... We got him. Telecast this on news immediately. I want him in person within the next 24 hours. Yes, sir. I want to amputate his hand, which stole all my belongings. - Sure, Sir. - okay. - Senthil... - Sir? - I have sent you a photo. - Yes, Sir? Prepare a look- out notice immediately. The news should be flashed in the media immediately. Okay, sir. If any one has any information, ask them to report to the nearest police station. Okay, sir. Madhan, I tried my best to divert her from divulging the information in enquiry. Hmm. Despite that she revealed Pandi's name instead of your's. - I doubt her, Madhan. - okay. In a jewellery shop burglary incident which happened few days ago in Chennai, T.Nagar, one of the burglars has been identified. This is the picture of Pandi He is the leader of the burglary gang. The police have released the pictures of Pandi. If public have seen him or have heard about him, they are requested to contact the telephone number displayed below. - What's this? - Chocolate. - I'm aware of that. - I don't have 1 rupee, so I gave chocolate. Will you accept if I drink tea and give you 10 chocolates? I don't have coins, what can I do? - Pandi, Pandi! - Cut the crap and Give me the change. I don't have coins with me. You have plate full of coins, why can't you give that? These are offerings to God. I will bear the brunt of taking God's money. Will God punish me? He will punish people like you who are trying to cheat. Leave it, bro. Come on, Pandi. Do you think you can easily cheat a villager? Pandi, listen to us. Where do such people come from? - Yes? - Sir, I'm calling from Adyar, Gandhi nagar. You are flashing a picture of a guy named Pandhi in news, isn't it? - Huh? - I saw him. Where did you see him? What the hell is going on? Sam we have a small problem here. Let me explain. Where the hell are my diamonds? Nothing like that happened You just give me a little more time Sam. I will have them in my hand by next week. You gotta be kidding me I'll be there tomorrow. Ok What's going on? I better take the flight It's way too big of a risk. What? You are just gonna fly back over there and kill everyone? We can't afford to lose it. There was a girl named Teja. She spoke with me. From the way she spoke to me, I feel she is hiding something from the minister. Madhan, the guy who shot you, definitely will search for me now, as I have his men in my custody. Before he comes in search of me, I have to a make a move and reach him first. It looks like Pandi cannot escape this time. The police are ready to obtain a shoot at sight order to arrest the burglar Pandi, and if need be, they will shoot him in order to get hold of him. What are you thinking, Madhan? She might have learnt my name while travelling in the vehicle, but why did she reveal your name instead? To make me a scapegoat. A goat to get slaughtered. - Pandi... - What now? Every channel is flashing my name. Burglar Pandi I'm not just a Burglar Pandi now, I'm the one who killed three persons. Did I kill them? Did I kill? Hey, Billy did I kill anyone? I'm in trouble now, but you guys escaped. It's not like what you think. He has two of our men in his custody, who went to kill her. If she has mentioned only your name, it only means that Kathir has instructed her to say so. He is trying to divert the police attention on you and has targeted me. I'm not bothered about you being the target. I'm in deep trouble in now. Five of us were involved in the heist. You and Naveeth killed those people. However, I'm the one who has to die for it. Well played! Despite being a thief I was alive. I didn't gain anything from this heist. The police will shoot me down, blaming me as a murderer. I'm going to die alone. I trusted you, and you conned me. You deserve this, Pandi! Well done! He wants to divide us. Now only we have to think straight. - What is there to think? - Just listen to me. What did you achieve by being patient? Please listen to me. What you have done is more than enough. Billy, I'm not asking you to come with me, but if you stay back, you'll end up dead. Hey, Billy! Don't listen to him. Don't go. Hey...Billy, Pandi. Wait. Go over there. Pandi, come let's go. - Billy, Take him away. - Listen to me. Hi, Kathir darling! Billy, Pandi, kill him. You think we will still follow your orders? Kill him. - What's is this? - Smoke. Tell the forensic team to come immediately. Okay, sir. Sir. You knew they were here, but still let them escape? You've only succeeded in capturing the smoke here. Is this how you nab the burglars? You have not achieved anything. Don't accuse us unnecessarily. Few things still remain a mystery in this case. How can we catch the burglars without knowing the full details? Why are you raising your voice against me? She clearly revealed a name Pandi for you to proceed further. You found his hideout too, but you failed to catch them, and now asking for more details. What details do you need? - What is this? - The girl mentioned the name Pandi alone, but from our investigation, we have found 4 more names like Madhan, Billy, Naveeth and Justin. Complete details of the jewel shop and all the jewels in the shop, including the details of the locker, he seems to know the intricate information even better than us. So, it looks like the information has leaked from our end. Not only that, he has your name, shop owner's name, and another name which starts with the letter T. Remaining letters have got erased. Only that remains a mystery, sir. Hey, you cheat! You back stabbed me. No, sir. I swear I know nothing. Is he the one? You said the name starts with T, right? - He is the driver. - Brother, one minute. Go down and wait. Brother... Brother, the word driver starts with letter D not T. Then whose name starts with T? You have a woman right beside you, in the name of Teja. She is the one. Let's go. Sir... Do you know why your name was written on the board? I think he loves me a lot, and that's why he has written down my name. Get lost! Kneel down. I told you to kneel down. I doubted everyone, but I never doubted you a bit. The reason behind it is the lust and the love I feel for you. Even after learning about your mistakes, I didn't have the heart to kill you. Just tell me where the diamonds are. Tell me, Teja. Tell me, baby. Tell me, dear. Tell me. Fool! Who will fall in love with you? Yes! It was my fiancé Madhan and me who schemed to loot your diamonds. We looted it too! However, we don't have the diamonds now. Do you remember interrogating a girl named Jeniffer? She and Kathir made a plan and diverted you in a different direction. Believing her words, you and your useless police force are searching for Pandi. I'm sure you won't get hold of those diamonds. Goodbye! Hey, Zahir where are you? We have reached, come soon. Hey! That's it, Madhan! We have failed, isn't it? We have failed! If the police nab Pandi, we will definitely be in trouble. Kathir and Jeniffer together created a havoc. Won't the police and the minister kill us on the spot? I have lost my dignity, Madhan. When I think about it, I feel ashamed of myself. I had an illegal affair with the minister... Why did Pandi get angry and leave? I don't understand. Madhan, when I'm talking to you, where are you looking at? Pandi? Will you speak only with Pandi, Madhan? Since you managed to escape from me, don't think you're smart. You are an Idiot! Come to this place immediately! - I'll share the, come soon. - Hello... Madhan, where are we going? Where are we going, Madhan? Madhan... - You check that side. - Hmm. Teja... Hmm. - Tell me, dad. - Hmm... Will you speak only with your dad, Mr.Kathir? Don't have any doubts. I'm speaking from your dad's mobile. When I was searching for you, I happened to see your dad in the park. Your dad seems to have a good habit. Hmm? Going for a walk in the morning from 6 to 7am. Even if it rains, he will still make sure to walk carrying an umbrella, isn't it? That is why I came to check how healthy he is. With my gun. Hey! Knowingly or unknowingly I killed one person in your family and I hope it stops at that. Come soon. Together we can check on your dad's health. Okay? Dad... What happened? Why have you come here? Dad, are you okay? I'm fine. What happened? Why are you asking such questions? I called you. My mobile is inside the bag. I kept it inside the bag and went for a walk. - Why are you asking about the phone? - Nothing, dad. - Hello? - Darling... Did you get scared? What will I achieve by killing your dad? How will it affect you, if I kill your father who has already lived his life? So, I thought it's better to kill a person who has her whole life ahead. - Shall I make a video call? - Hey! Kathir, who is it? What's happening? Who is it? Hey! Hey! So many tubes are attached to her. Will the kid die if I remove this tube? Maybe this one. - Huh? - Hey! You better don't harm the kid. She hasn't died yet. Okay, I'll tell you what to do. You come here. In the meantime, I'll try something else to end this child's life. Okay? This reaction is awesome. Come quick! - Kathir! - Dad, hold this. - Kathir, wait! - Dad. Be careful. Save the child at any cost. You stay safe, dad. What happened? Where is the child? Somebody tell me! This is why I was reluctant to talk about them. Now, look what happened. He took my daughter away. This is why I said, both of us can't do anything about them. I already lost my husband. Now, should I lose my daughter too? If anything happens to my daughter, I'll kill you. Hello? What happened, Kathir? Are you terrified? Don't be scared. The child is safe with me, in the ambulance. I heard the child's surgery is scheduled in one hour. She is already struggling to breathe. I really pity her mother. She has already lost her husband. Hope she does not lose her child too. What do you hope for? Oh! If the child dies, are you planning to convince and impress her mother? - Hey! - Hey you! Don't shout aloud. Listen to me patiently. Where are my men? Tell me. They're in the same place where you began all this. Wow! That's a great twist, Kathir. I'll release the child as soon as I see my men. However, I want to meet you for sure. Come, let's meet. Who is it? What happened to my daughter? Please save my daughter. Please, I want my daughter back. Give me some time, but I will definitely return with your daughter. Glory! I'm the only reason you are alive today. Why did you lie to me? Why did you lie? What's his name? What's his name? - What's his name? - Kathir. - Huh? - Kathir! Kathir! Tell me, Jeniffer! Kathir, the minister... Hey... Needhimanikam speaking... Where have you hidden my belongings and those 5 men? If you don't say it right now, I'll remove her clothes one by one, make her stand naked and send a video clip of that to you. Sir. It'll be embarrassing if you end up in jail at this age for sexual abuse. You think you're joking? Instead of threatening her, come to the jewellery shop where you had hidden the diamonds. That's where the men are. Come soon. - Madhan kidnapped Jeniffer's daughter. - What are you saying? I'll surely save the kid. I've asked them all to come to Nithila Jewellers. Please make sure to send enough policemen to the jewellery shop. Will it work out? - Do as I say! - Ha... okay. It's okay, Pandi. I committed a mistake by not listening to your advice. He has completely fooled us. He chased you away, and tied us up. If I get hold of him, I'll stab him to death. You have so much anger... on whom? On that guy, Kathir. That's fine. However... he has to die before Kathir. Why did you shoot him? On the day of burglary, I asked him to turn left why did he turn right? He is the person responsible for all the chaos. Am I right? Billy? Dear Billy, my boy! I let you hack everything, but I missed to check on you. Nice shot, Teja. Good one. Madhan... Don't do this Madhan! - Naveeth. - Let us go. - You betrayed me. - I'll shoot her if you come near me. I thought you will plead and beg for my mercy when the truth is out. However you... not only held her at gun point, but you touched her too. And you are a pro shooter, huh? Sorry, dude. I committed a huge mistake. I feel ashamed even to look at your face now. All of them confused me. I was greedy and I got tempted. Look at this. I got this scar while saving you. I guess you will remember that. Dude... No matter what happened, I'm still your friend. Did you even behave like a friend? Huh? - Pandi? - Will you talk only to Pandi? Come to this place immediately. JP logistics. Have you heard of it before? Don't think so hard. I'll share the location, come there. Come out! I'm sure you didn't forget me yet. What is the connection between you and Pandi? A project worth of 2000 crores. He is cheating by offering only 10 lakh rupees each. Won't selling the jewels fetch a huge sum of money? Will it amount to 2 crores? The worth of those diamonds are 2000 crores. Tell us what we should do. We shall plan the heist ourselves. Then come up with a good plan. I know a guy named Zahir from my hometown. We will tell him to come in a car and stage up an accident. - Hey, Zahir... - Tell me, dude. Take left! We will tell him to demand money for the accident. Come out! They are demanding 2 lakhs. Wanting to solve the problem soon, Madhan will quickly offer a settlement. We have valuable diamonds inside. Don't create unnecessary problems. Here, take it. Along with the money, I shall pass on the diamonds too. After the cylinder burst at your place Pandi came to collect the diamonds from me. A guy named Kathir followed him up. Kathir started beating all of us. When he started beating me up only, I revealed about the diamonds. Until then Kathir didn't know anything about diamonds. He took away all the diamonds. I have told everything I know. Please, let me go. I'll definitely let you go. What's your problem? Yes, it's true. It was us who devised a plan to loot you. We risk our lives to loot those diamonds, but you give us a meagre 10 lakh rupees and decided to keep the huge amount for yourself. What a wonderful plan! The other 3 men wanted to kill you on the same day. However, I let you live, since you were my friend. Go upstairs. Let me challenge you... If you are a legitimate child, drop the gun, and let's have an one-on-one battle. How will I know if I'm a legitimate child or not? Welcome, Kathir darling. Welcome! What did you say about me? Idiot Didn't you say I'm an idiot? I erased all the evidences that proved me an idiot. Now I'm not an idiot, am I? Where is the child? Where are my diamonds? I know that you have my diamonds. You can handover the diamonds to me and take the child along with you. Give it to me. What's the matter, Kathir? Are you still furious enough to seek revenge? What's your girlfriend's name? Narmadha Her death was an accident. I didn't have any pre-planned intentions to kill her. My only intention was to loot. She interfered, that too carrying a gun. She was such a brave girl. In this world, every life has a value. The value of Narmadha's death is your life. Handover the diamonds and get out of here alive. Narmadha's death can be avenged only by killing you and the other 4 men. You killed the other four men. However, I won't quit until I kill you. Come on, darling. Come on. Give me my diamonds! Kathir! You did all of that to get these diamonds, isn't it? My whole life will become magnificent due to the magic of these diamonds. These diamonds will be the magic which ends your life within a second. Killing people is such a simple task for you, isn't it? Hey... Are you Kathir? Where are my diamonds? He is slowly swallowing the diamonds. Go and get it. What do you mean he is swallowing the diamonds? Oh! Are you Madhan? Dear... You'll be fine. We're going to the hospital. I'll take you to your mom, okay? Hey, Perumal! - Cut him open. - Okay, brother. Totally 10 pieces. You shouldn't miss even one piece. I have realised the true colours of the people around me and the world I live in. Brother, I retrieved all the 10 pieces. "I'm overjoyed!" Damn it, die! Give it to me. Give me my diamonds. Hey, who are you guys? How many people will try to claim these diamonds? Do you remember Chicago? The Asians? I was supposed to be there before you. Now... Hey, give me the gun. Give me my diamonds. Sir, sir... Police have arrived. Round-up all of them. Now! I knew you will show up in the end. 'A few days later...' A few days back, a heist at a T.Nagar jewellery shop, which was the talk of the town, has seen a lot of twists and turns. The ruling party's M.P NeedhiManikam, arrested in connection with the incident, has been denied bail. The police suspect the involvement of an international mafia gang in this burglary To help them nab the gang, they are planning to approach the Interpol.
