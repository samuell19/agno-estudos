Hey, batter, batter. Swing, batter. - Swing, batter, swing. - Hey, batter, batter. - Batter, batter, you mullet. Ugh! - Yes! I was 13 years old in the fall of 1941 and had recently moved with my family to the most remote spot on earth, a spec in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. But Honolulu was a vital port, and shipping was my dad's business. - Wait for me. His company set us up in a big house, and I soon made friends with this kid next door to, Tomi Nakaji. He was a good guy and turned out to be the best friend I ever had. One day, Tomi and I were in a grassy field tossing a baseball around. "You know what, Billy?" he said. "This place is just about perfect." He was right. It was. For a while. Have you ever wondered what it'd be like to be a bird? You mean like one of Papa's pigeons? Yeah, like one of Papa's pigeons. Or a mynah bird? No, no, not a mynah bird. Why not? They eat cockroaches. Ew. But if you're a pigeon, you could fly so high, so free. Yeah, you could. - Ignore them. Stay behind me. Where'd they go, Tomi? - Come on, let's go home. Go home, now. - Today, you die, Jap. You don't think I'll do it? I'll cut you! I'll cut you like a fish! Get him. - So you know how sometimes you dream about pitching for the Yankees? - Yeah. - What exactly happens in those dreams? - Well, I pitch a no-hitter, become famous all over New York. Then I wake up. - Oh, yeah, then you wake up. Grampa. Grampa, what are you doing? Take that thing down. What if somebody sees it? - No, Grampa, not good. Did you hear what Papa said? This place is American, not Japanese. Grampa, let go. - Con fon it. - Why can't you understand what Papa said? We don't need any haoles to see that and think we're anti-American. There's a war going on, you know? Japan isn't making any friends around here. Don't you, remember? - You Japanese. Japanese. - No, Grampa, we're American. Criminy. You're gonna get us in a lotta trouble with that dumb flag. What's the matter out here, Tomi kun? What you doing? - Grampa got the flag out again. Ojichan, he is Ojichan. - Same thing. - Can't you listen to your grandson, Ojichan? Mr. Wilson, he no like that kind Japanese things. We could lose this house. English. - Con fon it. - Grampa, no need talk nasty. So dumb. Geez. - Yeah, but he's strong. What did he learn that wrist thing anyways? - Japan. Some kind of Judo or something. Can you do it? - Easy. He taught me. Here, I'll show you. Come at me like you're attacking. - Ah, ah! Geez. Enough already. - Not bad, huh? Want me to teach it to you? - Later. I think you destroyed my pitching arm. Nah, just kidding. Come on. Let's go. - No, I can't just let 'em do that to Papa's pigeons. - Tomi. - Hey, Tommy Kazu. Think your birds are bored. They need some excitement. - Don't, you'll scare them. - You mean like that? - Cut it out, Keet. - Hey, Jake, maybe your stupid little brother didn't see what we saw, huh? - Stop it. - Fish boy, think I'm stupid? Think I don't know what goes on around here? Think I don't know that you're flying that Jap flag on our property? Is that what you think? Hey, I know. Maybe I'll just go tell my father about it, huh? Let him handle it. How about that? - It won't happen again. I promise it won't. - Good, good, good, fish boy. That's more like it. I like humble. I like you to know your place. But listen, I need you to know something. I'll be watching you. That's what they needed. Hey, come here. Come. Listen, I don't wanna see you hanging around with this Jap any more. It's disgusting to see you two acting like friends, you know? Makes me kinda sick! You better think long and hard about where you stand, little punk. Come on, Keet. Let's get outta here. - Hanakuso face. Me and Keet used to be friends before you moved here. - Really? How come he changed into such a creep? - Somebody told him white guys are supposed to hate Japanese guys. - That's dumb. It's so hard. - What is? - Not fighting back. Don't argue. Don't fight. Don't bring shame to the family. That's what Papa's always hammering into my head. - What's that hanakuso thing mean? What you called Keet? - Booger face. - Got that right. - What did he mean when he said, "You better watch where you stand?" - He meant he's an idiot. - Hey, how's you, boys? You come to help me pull weeds? - No, but we can help you find some. Charlie, do you have my dad's paper? - What happened to you? I just ran into a doorknob. - That Wilson boy needs some guidance from his daddy. - Yeah, I guess. So do you have my dad's paper? - Inside on the table? - We can go in? - Of course! It's your place, yeah? - Yeah, but it's kind of, it's yours too. - I say go. - Thanks. Look. - Is this real? Yep. Mom says they've stocked on medical supplies and blood at the hospital. - Blood? - Yep. And everything else too. Dad said people have been flying back to the mainland. - Do you think Japan will attack us? - Maybe. - Why would they attack us? We're just a spec in the middle of the ocean. - We're a stepping stone. - What do you mean? - First Hawaii then? - The mainlands. Impossible. Come on, go get your bat. Let's hit some pop flies. - Yeah, sure. - Smooth. Easy. So, so you got them. From now on, that's your job, sharp the knife. Work, be useful. - You be careful Kimi. I will. - Papa will love this. He needs sharp knives to clean his fish. Grampa, you hide that flag yet? Just checking, Grampa. And anyway, if Mr. Wilson- - Sharp the knife, girl. Work. Be useful. Have a good day, boys. Thanks, Dad. Thanks, Mr. Davis. Hi, guys. - Hey, how much you and haole boy pay that chauffeur to drive you to school in that limousine? - What, you jealous? - Hey, your dad's car pretty sharp, man. I like that shiny paint. You never said he was rich. - Nah, we're not rich. - What you mean? All haoles is rich. - Oh hey, Janet. How's about me and you go to the movies? I'll buy you one popcorn. We could have a great time. She likes me. You like you, you mean. How's this, my haole boy? Us guys, we wanna for give you that 'cause you know why? You beat the Kaka'ako boys for us, and that feel pretty good, huh? - Thanks. It's a nice ball. - If I could pitch like you, I could get rich, you know. - Do you guys think we're gonna be in a war? - Why you say that for? - Well, it was in the paper that maybe we might. Did you guys hear about the Greer? - What's that? - It's U.S. destroyer that got shot at by a German submarine. They didn't sink it, but they shot at it somewhere in the Atlantic. - Ah. That German guy is sure causing a lot of trouble. You guys ever seen his army men march? - Spooky, man. - My dad says war's a-knocking. Like it or not, it's coming. - Look, just on this island, we've got the army, we got the Navy, we got the air corps, and we got the marines. No one's gonna mess with us. No one. - All right, guys? - See ya. Cool. Lucky. - Hi, Lucky. - Had a rough time sleeping under the house last night? Yeah. - Wanna toss the new ball around? - Yeah, sure. Go tell your mom. I'll show you how to really pitch. I wish I had a dog. - Then why don't you get one? - Maybe someday. - I found Lucky snooping around our garbage can when she was just a puppy. I guess someone dumped her up here. Grampa wanted to put her in a rice bag and drown her. "We no need no dogs," he said. - Your grandpa really wanted to drown the dog? - Yeah, that's what they did in Japan, I guess, when they had too much dogs. I could never do that. - Me neither. - She's one lucky fleabag. - Yeah, you're right about that. - But I'm luckier. Boy, the Kaka'ako boys sure got mad when they saw he could throw a curve ball. Yep. - Not bad for, for a haole. Hey, batter, batter. Swing, batter. - Papa home. Get up. Come clean the fish. But he's not supposed to be home until tomorrow. - Home now, con fon it. - I gotta go. - How are you boys doing? How's those girlfriends? - What are you laughing at? Pretty soon he is gonna be asking about your boyfriends. - Let me see that ball. How's your family, Billy? - Yeah, fine. - Come by the house after this. I give your folks some fresh fish. - Great, thanks. - I can't hit for beans, but I can pitch pretty good. - That was a little better than pretty good, Mr. Nakaji. - Let's go! Check on the birds. What happened here? - It got damaged. I tried to straighten it out. - Can we see the ones that go way up, Papa? - Sure. Go stand over there. - Wait until you see this. - Saturday, I going fishing out by Lanai. How's about you boys come with me, catch some tuna? - Me and Billy? - Unless he going get seasick. You get seasick, Billy? - Um, yeah! Uh, no, I don't, I. Yes, I'd love to come, please. - Let's go, clean those fish. Ojichan told me you got a new job! Sharpening the fish knives? - I'm useful. - So what about them? - They'll come back. It's what pigeons do. - Grampa, what are you doing? Mr. Wilson saw you. He yelled at me on the street. Gotta put that flag away, Grampa. He's gonna fire mom and kick us off of his property. - We Japanese. - No, Grampa, American. Put that flag away, please. Hey, look what my dad let me bring. - We can look at some marine periscopes. - And sharks. Hey, Mr. Nakaji. - Hi. - Billy, this is Sanji. Sanji, this is Billy. Okay. Let's go. So how big's your dad's boat? 20 feet. - Um. What's your name again? - Billy. - You ever been on one boat before? - Yeah. An ocean liner. My dad works for Matson. - Matson, oh. Big ships, huh? Well, anyway, this boat, small, huh? No more nothing for hang onto. You fall off, you gone. Poof. Hard for find somebody in the ocean. - Yeah, I can, I can keep myself aboard. - Good, good. - This is good place, Tomi. Smell that sweet air. We let those birds go home now. You can do it. - Hey, get your binoculars. - Come, come. - What is that? - Binoculars. - I heard of those. Heard of them? All right, look through here, and you can use this to focus it. - Oh! Oh! - Look. He always make like that. You see lots of those planes out here. Before, only one, two a week. Now, maybe 10 times that. By and by, this whole island going be only army mens. - It's because of the war. - What war? - The one in Europe and China. That's why we have all these planes here and ships and soldiers. - But no more war here. - Hey, I think I got something! - This one went straight down. Going to be hard for pull up. - I don't know, he kind of skinny, huh? What you think, Tomi? - I think we should get a rope and tie him to the boat so the fish doesn't pull him overboard. - Ha, you took so long for fight that, nighttime already. - How you feel, haole boy? - Like dog barf. - Was me, I cut the line. No dog barf when done. Gee, I never knew had mountains on it. - Yeah and craters, like stars crashed into or something. - You work hard today, haole boy. I thought you would only watch. You know what? You the first haole I ever talk to in my life. Can you believe it? - Ever? In your life? - I never went school like you and Tomi, just played around the boats until I was old enough to work. I learned to talk English from Portuguese I work for in tuna packers. - You're the first fisherman that I've ever heard said he'd cut a line with a fish on it. - I guess that's the difference between Japanese and haole. I don't fish for fun. - You call what I did today fun? - You okay, haole boy. You okay. What you say your name was? - Billy. - Oh yeah, like Billy goat. - Yeah. Whose car is that? - I don't know, but it probably cost a couple of bucks. - You could say that again. - I don't know, but it probably cost a couple of bucks. - Shut up, fool. - It's Keet's dad. - You, come here. You. You listen to this, boy. You people are walking on mighty thin ice around here. You tell your father I don't wanna see anymore of that Jap crap around my property. You understand? This has got to stop. - Geez. What was that all about? - I don't know, but I better get home. - Did you see this? - The Navy Department announced today that the destroyer USS Reuben James was sunk last night by torpedo west of Iceland. No further details are available at present. This is bad. - All those guys. - They died? Come on. - Don't fall for it, Lucky. He's not gonna give you that egg. - Take 'em Wilson place. - I don't want to, Grampa. - Take 'em, con fon it. You stupid, stupid idiot. I was just shooting at the birds in the bushes. It was an accident. Don't worry. I'll pay for it. You won't be out of any of your stupid money. Don't you get sassy with me, or I'll knock your block off. You hear me? You hear? I just said that I'll pay- - Oh, shut up. Give me that rifle. No, it's mine. Uh! Get out of here. I have had it with you. I don't wanna look at your idiot face. Too early for this. You wanna get better, you have to work harder. You're a slave driver. Are you kidding? I'm a slave driver? Your dad's a slave driver. That was nothing. They do that every day. I don't know if I could do that. Yeah, sometimes they're gone a week. They're out there right now. - I borrowed Jake's bat. We can hit pop flies all day if we want. My parents stayed last night at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel. Their anniversary. - You and Jake stayed home by yourselves? - Yeah. And Keet came over. Boy, was he in a bad mood. Come on, let's hit some. Did you hear that? - What is it? Geez. - The tree. My God. This is for real. We gotta get outta here. Grampa, what are you doing? - He see flag, he no bomb. - No, Grampa. Come on, quick before another plane comes. Mama, Japanese planes. They're attacking us. - That's just army planes like always. - No, they're bombing us. We saw from the trees. - I gotta get home. Maybe Charlie's picking some of this up on this radio. - I'm coming with you. Mama. - Tomi, run! - The radio. This is no drill. This is the real McCoy. The Japanese are attacking Pearl Harbor. I repeat, the Japanese are attacking Pearl Harbor. Take cover. The United States Army Intelligence has ordered that all civilians stay off the streets. Do not use your telephones. Keep your radio turned on for further news. - Where they came from? That's what I wanna know. - Have you see my parents? Do you know where they are? Have you heard from them? - No, nothing. They down Waikiki. It's safe there, Billy. No worry. Your papa, he's home? - He's fishing with Sanji somewhere. They be fine out there, Tomi. Your papa is- What was that? - Army, Navy. They must be shooting at those planes and missing. They're gonna blow us up instead. Stand by. A warning to all people throughout the territory of Hawaii and especially on the island of Oahu, stay undercover. - I gotta go home. - Your family need anything, you call me, okay? Anti-aircraft guns. I repeat, stay under cover. - Go find Kimi. She hiding somewhere. See if she all right, Tomi kun. - Is your dad here, kid? No, sir. - Where is he? - Fishing. - Someone in this area was signaling the Jap fighters. Do you know anything about that? Look, I need you to think hard. This is extremely serious, okay? We were told the Japs dropped parachuters up in that valley, and someone was waving a flag for them to show the way. Have you or have you not seen anything like that? - We, we didn't see any parachuters. Let's get outta here. Come on. Come inside, Charlie-san. - I just came by to tell you, I heard on the radio, come nighttime, you gotta make the windows black. You can't have any light show through from the inside. - Tomi, go get eggs for Charlie-san. - No, no, you keep them. Food going to be hard to get very soon. - Some soldiers were here. - What did they want? - Papa. - They're going all around looking for Japanese men now. The radio said they poison the water supply up in the mountains. - Kimi. - Really? - That's what they said. Watch out for prowlers. - Prowlers? - Men with guns. They forming up. They're going all around, keeping an eye on Japanese. Never mind your house is hidden in the trees. They're still coming. - How's Billy? Did his parents come home? - They both helping wounded men. The mama at the hospital, the papa at the harbor. Big mess down there. A lot of Navy ships went down. - Are they coming back? I mean, the Japanese? - Nobody knows. Where's your Grampa? - Somewhere. I don't know. Maybe he went downtown. He's confused, Charlie. It's spooky to see him like that. - Remember what I said. When is Grampa coming home? Mama? - He just went, Tomi kun. He didn't say more. But where do he go? Mama, I left Annie in the kitchen. - Tomi, go get that doll. - I can't find it. Mama, I'm gonna turn on the light, just for a second. Get ready to look. But this room isn't blacked out. - It's okay. It'll only be a second. Annie! Here she is. No lights! - Someone's watching us, Mama. Charlie said they would. Who's out there? They're digging graves. - Criminy, Grampa. Where have you been? Who's digging Graves? - Army men, up the cemetery. Bodies from Pearl Harbor. Hear that? Jackhammer on rock. Lots of bodies, Tomikazu. Lots of dead people. - Are you Taro Nakaji? Do you speak English? FBI. - Please, come inside. - Is this man Taro Nakaji? - No. He fishing, not home. - Fishing. Come home tomorrow or next day after that. - Mind if we look around? Please, look, please. - Inside the house. - What do they want, Tomi? It's a mistake. You'll see. Someone reported that you have messenger birds here. Is that true? - My dad, he has some pigeons, but they're not messenger birds. - How long has your father been sending messages to the enemy? - I said they're not messenger birds. They're pigeons. And my father didn't send any messages to anyone. - Maybe he did, and maybe he didn't. I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. And if there are enemy agents around here, I'm gonna find them. We're at war. Do you understand that? - My father's not an enemy agent. - Show me the birds. Kill them. What? - We have to do this, son. - But they're not messenger birds. They're pigeons. - Kill them. - Grampa? - Go back house. Get knife, two, sharp ones. Go. - Have you been sending messages to the enemy? You want me to drag your way in handcuffs in front of that boy? - Two sharp, you know, knives. - Are you loyal to Japan? - No, we American. Birds no take message. - Ojichan, you awake? Grampa? - We have been disgraced. Hey. - What's you got those books for? - School. Where's Billy? He wasn't home. - Gone, everybody gone. Went to go help out somewheres. - But what about school? - No more, canceled. Come, we go to your place. I need to talk to your mama. I heard on the radio there's men still trapped in some of those ships. - Can't get out? - The ships are belly up. They're trying to cut you to steel. Bad down there, Tomi. Fires still burning, planes, hangars, barracks, ships. They say couple thousand men killed. Most of them Navy guys. - They made us kill papa's pigeons. - What? - They thought we were sending messages to the enemy. Mama, Charlie's here. - How you doing, mama-san? You need anything? - No. We okay. Thank you. - ID cards. You need to fill these out. If you don't, then- We got 13 eggs, Mama. - You folks heard, we just declared war on Japan. It's getting worse now. All around these islands, they're arresting Japanese men. They said they helped plan the attack on Pearl Harbor. They said fishermen's been taking fuel out to submarines. - Fishermen? - They're gonna arrest all the fishermens, and they're going to arrest language school teachers and Japanese businessmen and Buddhist priests like that. More better you folks stay close to home for a couple of days. Everybody nervous about Japanese people right now. The paper said that the navy going to shoot any boat that come toward the island if no get one American flag on top. I'm sorry. Help your mama fill these out. Don't go anywheres without that card. And, Tomi, you gotta be the one to go for what you need. They gonna give your Grampa a hard time 'cause he's old timer, yeah. But you just one kid. And Mama-san, no talk Japanese and no bow like a Japanese and no wear Japanese clothes, kimono, like that. Go on curfew now. After dark, stay inside. You understand? If you don't, they gonna shoot you. - We going through this house and find everything that could bring trouble. Yesterday, December 7, 1941, a date which you live in infamy, the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan. - Hey, fish boy, how's your messenger birds? Tell your mammy not to bother coming to work at our house anymore. In fact, my dad is considering kicking you off our property. We don't wanna be supporting any Jap sympathizers, you know. Wouldn't be right. Hear what I'm saying? Hey, I'm talking to you! - That's enough. He's just a kid. I told you to leave him alone! It was him, you know. He told the FBI about your birds when they came to his house. I'm really sorry. - Boat back. Police take 'em jail. Papa? They took him to jail? - No can see him. All fishermen, they lock 'em up. Navy plane shoot boat because no flag. Sanji dead. Papa shot, in the leg. They drag boat inside canal, sink 'em. It's okay. It's okay. Hmm? Nay, I no sleep to good too. Hmm, con fon it. - Hey. What is this? - It's a bomb shelter. - I came over two times before, but no one was home. - My mom is practically living at the hospital. My dad joined the volunteers, and me and Jake have just been helping, you know, just helping out. - It's nothing personal, you know? I mean, it hasn't been easy for anyone, I guess. - We just started. Did you wanna help? - Yeah, I do. - All right. You can take the sandbags and put 'em over there. What? What's the matter? - Sanji's dead. - What? - Shot my dad in the leg too. Sank his boat. Are you serious? - They were just coming in from fishing, like always. They just shot up their boat. - Who? Wait, wait, who shot up their boat? - We did, our own guys. They didn't have an American flag. They didn't even know they needed one. - Oh, criminy. He was a, he was a good guy. Stupid war. Is your dad gonna be all right? - I don't know. I think so. We don't know where he is. He got arrested. - Arrested? Why? - He just tried to come home. Hey, cockroach. - Hey, Mose, hey, Rico. - What you doing down here? - Going down to the police station. See if I can find out where my father is. - So how's about we go with you? - Yeah, sure. Thanks. What you looking at? My zipper down or what? - It's my Jap shooter. You watch your step. - Have a seat right there, please, ma'am. You boys want something? - My father. Is he here? - Yeah, is he here? - What's his name? We got him in the tank? - What's a tank? He got arrested. He's a fisherman. The navy, they shot. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. We don't have those guys in here. The FBI took 'em in, not us. Okay, listen. My guess, Sand Island. After that, I can't say. Thank you, sir. - Boys. Best you guys go home. You're not gonna get anywhere near Sand Island. You go home. Go home. - Where you been? I've been looking for you. - Around. Outside with my friends. - Ojichan gone again. You go find him. He went in the trees. Grampa. - Tomi. What is done is done. - Grampa, don't! - This belong your ancestor. Long time ago. Nobody since then bring dishonor to name of our family. My country, my country, Tomikazu, they, they... - This is your country now. You couldn't help what happened. Forget it. It wasn't your fault. - I have no country. I have nothing. - You have this, Grampa. Where's he going? - Hide the sword. He's ashamed, Tomi. - I thought he was gonna kill himself. - Ha! Kill himself? He's not that ashamed. - We go. - Hey, Billy. - Hey. Remember these? - Yeah, sure, your dad's binoculars. - Yep. He gave them to me. - Gave them to you? - Uh huh, Christmas present. - Christmas? You had Christmas? - Sure. Didn't you? - Oh yeah, sure, we, we had it. - Come on. Go to the tree and look at Pearl Harbor through these things. Let me see. - You know the Arizona burn for three days? - It seems like a bad dream, but it really happened, didn't it? - There's still some guys trapped in those ships. They cut a few out, but some are still in there. Think about it, being trapped in one of those ships. They don't even know what happened. Tomi! - Mama, up here in the tree. Come down. We going visit Sanji's family. - Do you think I can come too? - Mama, - Wa- can Billy come too? - Geez, somebody needs to teach you some tact. Sure. Billy, you come. - What's tact? - Who's that? - That's Sanji's mom. - What are they talking about? - I think they went to the vegetable stand. - You think? You can't understand them? - Well, I catch a few words. Mama said that Papa loved Sanji like a brother. - Tomi, Billy, this is Reiko, Sanji's wife. - It is so good to meet you. I heard of both of you. Sanji talk about you all the time. This is Mari. - Look what I have. Do you wanna take a look through them? Look right here. Do you see your grandma? - Mari chan, give it back to Billy. - No, no, those are for her to keep, please. Next time when the full moon is out, I want you to show her the mountains on it. - Please. - For Mari. - Please, please, is too much. Sanji looked through them at the boat, and- - Just take something. It'll make her feel better. - How about a banana? - Here you take. - Mari, will you do something for me? Well, I want you to show your friends the mountains on the moon, all right? I want you to make sure they all get to see it at least once. Can you do that for me? Thank you. - You good boy, Billy. You welcome my house anytime. - Thank you. - This area's restricted. Go home, kid. This ain't no place for you. Psst. Hey, man, over here. - Don't move. Lie flat. Who are you? What are you doing here? - Tomi Nakaji. I'm looking for my father, Taro Nakaji. - Don't move, boy. The guards see you, they're gonna shoot. You stay down. I come back. Tomi! - Papa, I- - Shh! No, say nothing! You listen to me. Stay in the trees until nighttime. Then go! You hear me? Go! Guard coming. - Get down! You're very brave. Tomi, you tell Mama not too worry. Tomi. - Take it easy now. Move, I'll shove this thing through your neck. You understand me? Where's your ID? Over here, under my sweatshirt. - Get it, slowly. What are you doing down here? - Nothing. Just swimming. - Swimming? - Yes, sir. I got tired. You know there's a curfew? - Yes, sir. This curfew business is dead serious. Yes, sir, I know. - Count yourself lucky this time. But if we catch you down here again, not letting you off so easy. You got that? - Yes, sir. You don't live here, boy. - I live next door. My mother works for the people that live here. She's their housekeeper. - Go on, get home. And do not forget what we told you. Who's out there? You better speak up. I've got a gun! Tomi! - Where you been? Tell me now. I heard gunshots. - I saw Papa. Mama. - Not tell lies to me. You smell like oil. Tell me where you've been. - Mama, I went to the harbor. To Sand Island. Papa's okay, Mama. He said not to worry. - It's not okay! You lie! You no can go there. - No, Grampa, I'm not lying. I saw him. I swam through the harbor- - Hush! - I'm sorry, Mama. I know what I did was wrong. - Oh, Tomi. - I'm sorry. - Please. No make trouble for us and for Papa. Nakaji must always be a good name. Do you understand? - I was worried about him, Mama. - You must be hungry. I'm not angry, Tomi kun. We were afraid. Afraid for you. I look in Ojichan eyes, and I see how he is so worried about Papa. Just like I am. Just like you. And then you were gone too. What would we do with Papa gone and you gone? And Ojichan an old man? We need you Tomi kun. We need to be together, to help each other. - I had to know, Mama. I just had to know. I promise I won't do anything like that again. - You very brave, Tomi kun. Very brave. But we need you to be brave here. You sleep now. - Hey, buster. Go look the porch. What is this? Kerosene. - Where did it come from? - Look name on side. - Mama, look what the Davis gave us. Kerosene for stoves. - Go get 15 egg. Take 'em to their house. - Do what Ojichan says, Tomi kun. - I'll give them all our eggs and half of our chickens. Hey, I was just at your house. Thanks for the kerosene. - Oh, thanks for the eggs. - Grampa's idea. Really? - Yeah, sometimes his brain works. - Hey, wanna go hit some balls? I got a bat. We can go to the field, hit some grounders. - Yeah. Let me get my glove. - Yeah. Hey, what about we invite the old geezer to join us? - Your Grampa, for real? - Yeah, for real. - Okay, then. Let's go find him then, con fon it. Ee, ee, girls. Ee ee ee ee. - Ojichan, come take a break. Me and Billy play some baseball. - What for? - For nothing. You don't need a reason to take a break. - I no more time for that. - Come on. I'll do this work for you later. How's about that? - You clean chicken coop? - Sure. - You take egg, sell 'em? - Yeah, come on Grampa. - You pick weeds- - Grampa! Go. I get Kimi. - Hey, Grampa, come bat. - Bat, Grampa, bat! - Con fon it. Okay. - Want me to show you how to hold it, Grampa? Grampa DiMaggio up to bat. Send him a good one. - Ooh, uh! - Strike one. Keep your eye on the ball, Grampa. - Okay, okay, okay. Hey, buster, good, no? Oh, Lucky dug up the flag. - Lucky! - Get her! - Lucky, Lucky. - Come on, Lucky. - Come on. - Lucky. Lucky. - Get the flag. - Lucky, Lucky. - Good girl. - Crazy dog. You wanna get us arrested? - She was having a good time. Wasn't she? - Yeah, a good time giving me a heart attack. We'll take care of it, Grampa. Come on. We have to rebury this flag under a pile of stones. Come on, Lucky. Come on. - Tomi kun, somebody knocking. It's Mrs. Wilson. Mrs. Wilson, come inside, please. - I can only stay a minute. Is something wrong? - No. You have very good friends in the Davis family. Mr. And Mrs. Davis came over last night to speak with Mr. Wilson on your behalf. We, of course, have been concerned, but they assured us your family is completely loyal to the United States. So, well, we've decided to have you return to work. - I come, 15 minutes. - Good. Yes, 15 minutes then. - Do you think school's ever gonna start again? - Mm, yeah, eventually. - Just seems like the whole world is just falling apart. - Yeah, that's for sure. Whose car is that? - Mama! No! - Grampa! Mama, Grampa, what's happening? Hey, speak English! They did this to Grampa. Come out of there, come out. - Tomi, Tomi, stop. - They did this to Grampa. - You don't know that. You don't. You could get yourself into more trouble, Or you can get kicked off their property. What would you do then? Huh? What? Nothing. Come on, let's get outta here. - Who were those men? And why did they take Grampa away? - They just take him. No say why. No say nothing. - But who were they? - FBI, police. What we going do? - We're gonna do what Papa would do. We're gonna say strong, Mama. They took Grampa, the FBI. - Lot of men getting arrested now. But your Grampa? - He had the flag. - He was ashamed of Japan. They wrong about him. - He told me to protect the katana, but I don't know where he hid it. - Come. I show you. This is the one. This is your grandfather's greatest treasure, Tomi. His history. Yours too. Keep oil on it, so no rust. Find safe places for 'em until after the war. Move it around in case somebody sees you with it. They scared some peoples now when they see that kind of stuff. Hide 'em good. - Hold it right there, fish boy. I knew you were in on it, Jap! You know exactly what I'm talking about, don't you? - I wasn't- - You and that old man's flag, waving it at the Jap planes. - I wasn't, it was just- Geez, what are you- - Shut up! Drop the weapon. Back away from it. Move it! Where'd you get that thing? - It's my Grampa's. It's been in our family for hundreds of years. - Probably got it at some carnival. Back off! I mean it, fish boy! You little pecker. My dad's gonna go nuts when he hears about that Jap sword! - You're not gonna tell him anything. - What's that supposed to mean? - It means if you tell him, and he takes this away from me because of what you said, I'm gonna make you pay, and not with money. - You and what army? - Me and this army. Put that rifle down. Let's see how brave you are. - Why would I want it to be that? I'd crush you. It wouldn't be fair. Besides, I could just shoot you right now and do the whole world a favor. Who would ever- Ugh! Let go! You're gonna break it. Mom! Mom! You and your stupid family will be on the street tomorrow! - It's nothing. I tripped and hit my head on a rock. It was dumb. - Mrs. Wilson. - Shh, I can only stay a second. If Mr. Wilson knew. Nevermind. Just take this. - What is it, Tomi kun? What does it say? Read, Tomi kun. - I can't believe it. - Tomi! - It says, "I heard my husband speaking on the telephone. The men being kept at Sand Island are being sent to the mainland sometime tomorrow. If you want to see if your husband is among them, go to the Aloha Tower and wait. Please don't tell anyone I told you this. Burn this note." Why did she tell us this, Mama? - She, She is a good person, Tomi kun. - We have to be there. - Yes. Papa. - Hey kid, get back here. Your hurt. - I'll be fine, but you. - I'll be all right. Tell Ojichan- - They arrested him. - They're not treating us bad. We coming home soon as we can. You understand? But right now you are to take my place. You have to take care of Mama and Kimi. It'll be all right. It's got to. - We'll be waiting here for you. Don't worry. I'll find a job. - Hey, lazy bones, come on, get up. School's on again. - School? - School, remember? Books, homework, Mr. Ramos? Come on, my dad's waiting. Mama? We go to school again. - How's it, punks? - Been better. - Seen better days, that's for sure. - You can say that again. - Seen better days. That's for sure. - Looks like they went and fought a war, huh? Except I don't see no blood spots. - How can you be saying that? Guys die on those boats, okay? So it's not right to talk like that. - Got your gas mask? - Yeah, watch. It gonna make me look like one monster. Huh? Hmm? - Least I can look and see a hanacuso nose. - Billy can talk like us now. Did you hear about Mr. Ramos? He's going to join the navy. - Oh, man. He was a good teacher. - Well, at least we were lucky enough to have him as a teacher. You got that right. - What that boy wants now? - I don't know. Why are you here? - My mom, my mom made my dad get these birds for you. - Thought your dad was gonna kick us off of your property? - You want these birds or not? - Hey, don't you think it's kinda stupid? - What's stupid? I'm outta here. - Stupid to be enemies. - Maybe. - Hey, Wilson, watch. It wasn't until 1945 that Tomi's family was whole again. They picked up the pieces of their lives and moved on with dignity and grace. They all did. Even that crazy old grandfather, con fon it. But I will never forget that time in my life because of what I learned of courage and resolve in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. Tomi taught me something every boy is meant to learn but too often doesn't. He taught me how to be a man. And for that, I am forever grateful.
