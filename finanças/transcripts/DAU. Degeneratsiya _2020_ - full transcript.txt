Communism is basically a religion. The Marxist, Leninist, Stalinist religion without a God. Which is a messianic religion. It has a holy book, it has a church. It has a head of the church. It has all kinds of rites, rituals. You, the Great Ones, I welcome you from the mountains, from the rocks. You lords of destinies. Give this man heart, give him mind. Purify this man. You who created everything, may you hear me and give him breath. I'm addressing these words to you, hear them. May you hear them. There are in the Communist Party, in many ways, the same thing that happenend in some heresies. It's the belief that you have to make things worse in order to become better. To destroy things in order to create the revolution. This is the Institute, which was constructed in 1938. It's very impressive. Yes, very. So, we have two inhabited buildings here. The one on the left and the one on the right. The left one is the shared apartment for the scientists who work here permanently, and also for the guests This is a kind of an infrastructure, very developed, so that people wouldn't need to go to the city. For instance, we have a cafe, a barbershop here. Now we should proceed to the security department. As we are on the territory of the restricted access Institute. So, comrade Sirs. You have arrived at a restricted, secret Institute which works on defence solutions for the USSR. Any pieces of information which you willl receive here are considered state secrets. All clear? Very clear. Are you willing to sign a declaration stating you will not divulge our state secrets? Yes, ready. Take a look at this. Signature, please. This is all. Thank you very much. Good evening, comrades. Today is the first day of our extensive conference dedicated to a rather new issue for our institute which is very current, interdisciplinary reasearch. and the synthesis of natural sciences and the humanities. I would like to note that our guests today are not solely religious practitioners. Father Daniil also teaches at the Moscow Theological Academy and Rabbi Steinsaltz is a professor at the University of Jerusalem. Naturally, we can be rather sceptical about what we're going to hear today. I would like to say, that our guests do not intend to prove to our academic community that God exists. The idea is to familiarise us with the concepts of Man in Judaism and Orthodox Christianity. I'll now give the floor to Father Daniil. Go ahead. Thank you. First of all, I must thank the Institute's directorship for inviting me to talk to you, the scientific community. I'm very pleased to be here. As the director said, I don't want my lecture to be seen as some kind of missionary work. It's more of a simple heart-to-heart. The spiritual practice of Christianity maintains that people cannot commit acts of pure goodness. They don't have the powers within themselves to commit purely good acts. Any good deed we do always contains an element of something impure. It could be through pride, or out of jealousy. It could be praising yourself, "Look how good I am". So this presence of something that isn't pure or good is found in every human act of goodness. Agreed? I have difficulty understanding good and evil. Trifonov, however... If we're touching on this topic, I'd say the main danger is that any person can claim the ability to judge what is good and what is evil. This ability to judge is, for me, much more dangerous than the presence or absence of well-defined criteria for good and evil. So it's a question of the criteria of good and evil? Not just about these criteria, but whether we're able to take on the responsibility for saying what is good and what is evil. Of course, from a human perspective it's impossible to define these concepts precisely. We can still assume that by "God" we mean someone who can commit that pure and absolutely good act, that we intuitively know, does exist. If we put it like that? So your understanding of God is ethical? As a source of the absolute good? Ontologically, the existence of God seems strange for a mathematician, in particular. It sounds like an ill-understood definition. The absence of a definition. But how can man find salvation in abstract concepts? God is an abstract concept in any case. God cannot stay abstract when he becomes very concrete. You just said that God is an unattainable absolute good. For us it sounds like an abstract notion. We're used to work with abstract ideas in a concrete way. If a person could commit a good act by himself, he would need neither religion, nor church, nor God. But he doesn't have those powers. They always come to his aid from the outside, as a sign of God's presence and support. That's how it is. People have a tendency to talk. People have a tendency to talk. Great tendency. And to give names to things. But usually they don't know what they're talking about. We are speaking about atoms and about electrons. We don't know what atoms are, really. And we don't know what electrons are. There was a great physicist that said: "For me, when I envision electrons," "they're small little red balls moving in space." He knew this is not true but he said: "I cannot do otherwise." Now, if I am a modern-time scientist, I don't care what an electron is, I don't care what is the movement, What happens if one of the ions moves to the other side. I can make a formula and I can apply it properly. I know how they operate. To some extent. I've come to a world in which basic notions are no longer important. I'm not saying it's a bad thing. I'm just saying there's a change. It's a change in understanding. That was what I'm writing about. Comparing it to other ways of thinking, that also don't begin with well-known pieces of knowledge. But you begin with things that you really don't know what it is. In a certain way, religions do it all the time. We speak about God. If you are a theologian you surely don't know what God is. In one of our holy books it says, it doesn't sound perhaps nice. "No kind of thinking can understand God." "Only the inner will of the heart can understand God." I'll put it in a slightly different way. The question about the existence of God, as much as it has to do with the question of "Who was the source of all things?", it is, in a certain way, a scientific question. If I say, "What is the purpose of all things?" it becomes a very different question. The purpose is always in the future, so I can't deal with it scientifically. I can even say that I don't have any scientific proof that the purpose exists. But the question exists. From the question of the smallest children: "What is the purpose? What for?" Let me just put it in a more... I would say, in a sharper way. When you begin to ask this question, somehow you are already, without willing it, in the realm of religion. Doesn't mean you're in the realm of a specific religion, Christianity, or Judaism, or Buddhism, but you're in the realm of religion. That's your definition of religion? Religion by definition deals with this kind of... Anything that deals with this is a religion. Look, if within the time and space, in many ways, communism is a religion. I'm not saying that I adhere to this religion. You may like it, you may believe in it. You may even call it scientific, if you want to, but it is a religion. This religion also has the notion of a purpose. Clearly, very clearly. Because that's the innermost part of it, which is: "To what direction does society have to go?" Not, "Where does it go?" But, "What is the necessity to develop in the future?" We were just getting over the notion of being almost relatives here in this Institute, since we're living here for so many years, door to door, window to window. I see. No, it's enough. In some places, they would say, "This is un-Russian". You sit and talk and you don't have anything to drink. I mean except water. I knew an old man. He always drank and he used to drink only pure alcohol. Ninety-six proof, ninety-six percent. So, later on he was an old man, they found out that he has a malady. He has water in the lungs. He complained and said, "I never drank water in my life" "How did it come?" Then he says, "These are the 4 percent in the vodka." Let's drink to the fun. Comrades, Dau wishes you all a good night. Dau says, "Goodbye." Nikita, thank you. According to your definition, I'm a religious person? Yes. In my religion, the absolute value is knowledge. The rest is relative and the absolute sin would be lying. Distorting information, you know? Knowledge is power. Right. Something like that, yes. Knowledge is also in this society a position. You know what's interesting? In this country, the Soviet Union, it's not obvious, but a very strong feeling, that science is almost like a religion here. I know, it's very highly respected. I don't know if it's good or bad, that's how things are. Look, being a scientist is a definition in itself. Being a scientist doesn't mean you're a better person. No. Because of that, you may be a scientist and a lousy human being. The value of being knowledgeable is more than the value of being a good human being. I know that, I know it. Let me really be insistent here. The vodka is getting warmer and warmer. Yes, very good. Thank you so much. I decide where everyone goes. Some are scientists, others are... Working class? Exactly. Flipping heck. I'll keep deciding. I'm already almost 100 years old. Find your place in the pecking order. If you're a waiter... Then it's your vocation, right? No smoking in the grounds of the Institute. It says there. Lean back. One more bolster. Comfortable? The young geniuses will visit you now . They will ask you some questions. Will you be glad to see them? Dad? Will you be glad to see them? Anyway, Dad, it's clear you're feeling better now. Hello, guys. Hello, Nora. You know that Comrade Dau lives here. The famous scientist and academic. Let's go up and see him. And you'll get better acquainted with him. And he'll answer your questions. Denis was born in this flat. We've had some very happy times here. Let's go. How did your love of physics begin? Your love of physics, Dau, was it from childhood? Your interest? I just think... How did your love of physics begin? Maybe my parents influenced me. They are also involved in science. So from a young age I thought I'd work in physics or maths. So, it happened. We might need your help, Nora. What's your name again? Edward. So, Edik. Dau, Edik will ask a question now. What would you would sacrifice for science? And what should any scientist be prepared to sacrifice? Where do you draw the line? Or is there none? I don't think Dau ever gave it much thought. You know? He just lived and worked. He lived and worked as best he could. Thank you. My father made drafts for the nuclear bomb. It's a difficult question, but I thought... Is his car crash connected in some way? In a mystical way? Yes, as if God punished him. I don't think so. Mathematicians rarely believe in mystical things. How many more cups? Four more. How old are you, Denis? Seventeen. Are you afraid of death? I think about that a lot, but I fear death less and less now. I've never had the fear of death. I have. I haven't thought about life after death. You may suffer here, but after you die, you don't feel anything. I've always been afraid of it. So why be afraid? I live over here, but over there there's nothing at all. But there's no You anymore. You can't even feel that you don't feel anything. You won't even be able to think about it. I regret now. I won't regret in the afterlife. So, you're afraid to lose your feelings over there? Yes, that there's just nothing at all. Nothing. I do want to retire. Deservedly so. So I train up new staff. You coming in here? Yes. To eat? Yes. Come on in. Hello. Let me through, guys. Sorry. Good afternoon, canteen. Shall we move the tables together? Is Asya coming? Yes. I'll call you back later, alright? Did you order the cheese croquets? No. The kids are here to eat. The kids can suck a dick. Ivan. I can't go on like this. I could make some sandwiches. Nothing's ready yet? Yes, we had a late delivery today. It'll be at least thirty minutes. We've nothing but beer. No? No beer. Any chocolate? Yes. May I have a Kosmos bar, please? Want some chocolate? No, thanks. We've got a lecture now. A lecture? Yes. We'd like to eat before the lecture. Put a double on my bill. On yours? Ich kann so nicht. First thing in the morning? First thing? Yes, to lift my spirits. Fucking hell, Ivan. You tired? Not enough vodka? No, Ivan. Have you not had enough vodka? Fucking pour some for a friend. Never. Greedy fucker. You're at work. I certainly am. And I'm having fun. And you can drink at work? Yes. You can and I can't? I'm Head of Personnel. Fucking disaster is what you are. That's fucking amazing. Give me my hat. Why the fuck you need it? You feel better when you're pissed, don't you? Of course, I like my drink. I get it, you hogged the vodka, yes? Ivan, enough of this circus. What? Get to work. Let's get frying. See you, Palych. Get started. And you Palych, don't distract them. Enough of these private parties. Go to the canteen. I don't want any singing and dancing here Seriously, I'm not joking. Ivan, darling? Could you stew some perch or salmon? Gordienko is asking, he has a weak stomach. A light dish? Some perch and vegetables. Yes, alright. We have the manifold and the circle fixes the point. So you have a strong force on the tangent space. Accordingly, this space of dimension 2n becomes a representation of the Group U(1). In this representation everything is rotating. Because if you have a vector like the circle acting on it, you get a line of fixed points passing through here. The vector will be tangent to this line. So we get an irreducible representation. Reducible but without trivial components. I see. Every representation of the Abelian group like U(1) splits into irreducible representations. And the second fact is: If V is not equal to zero, then every equivariantly closed form is equivariantly exact. What do you mean by "not zero"? Where it's not zero, it is equivariantly exact. But this infinitesemal vector field that we take, doesn't it come from a one-dimensional group? U(1) has some restrictions. Fixed points have integer weights. Therefore it can be anything. This sort of a miracle happens very rarely. It's like a harmonic oscillator, removing unwanted matter. Go in, I'll just get some fresh air. How are things? Not bad. We've spoken with the young people. Are they any good? They are. Worthy replacements? There's work to be done. We need to work with them. To girlfriends. I want to give you a lecture. Go on then. A short one, around forty minutes. A lecture on the meaning of friendship, love, and respect. You young people. You have a unique opportunity to start a revolution which our generation fucked up. Right? So if you make it happen. If you make a real revolution happen... Revolution. Like the one that once caught us up in its current. You know, I'm already finished. Glory to revolution. Hooray. A revoluton is what we need, you understand? Every day. Every day. And every minute. A revolution within yourself. No, it has to be on the outside. For fuck's sake, outside, get it? It often ends very badly on the outside. Like fuck we need it. The revolution must be, what do they call it? Flowing, flowing. Yes? Still speaking, is he? Alright, let's go clockwise. Let's rather go anti-clockwise. Give the floor to the director. Trifonov, you're being asked. To speak? Yes. In that case. I'd like to drink to those who lived through the revolution. The counter-revolution, the counter-counter-revolution and still managed to stay human. To those who stay human despite what surrounds them. To be honest, when I'm surrounded by water. I try to become a fish. When surrounded by water, I try to become a seaweed. But you shouldn't be like that. Once more. You shouldn't, because... Look into my eyes. You know what... Not many people survived those times. People are what need to be overcome. People are boring. I want to dance. I see that. When I was dancing, you were just standing. Most of them are drinking wine. They're intelligent people, Komsomol members. Mainly wine and champagne. How can you allow this? It's better to relieve your stress somewhere else, without vodka, without anything. It's all the West's influence. But this is Moscow. We need to set them straight. As Head of Personnel you allow this? But it's good to dance with the youngsters. You should've opposed all this. Hide your bra straps. Don't touch me. Alright, but hide your straps. What? Hide them. What, you don't like it? I like it. Why? Shall I get naked? I'll like it whatever. I'll go like this. As you wish. Fine, I won't hide the straps. I don't feel well today. Why did you say you felt fine? I asked you to help. I don't get why you're acting like an old woman. You're not young anymore. We've got guests. You're playing the fool, it's disgusting. I don't want to hear foul language. I'm trying to understand why this is happening. I'll explain. All I ever wanted was to live in peace and harmony, and for everybody to be able to do their thing. What is it you do exactly? I'm Head of the Acoustic Lab. But what do you do? What I do is... Yes? I've at last achieved what I've been working on for ten years. Mind your finger. That's longer than our marriage, Masha. I've managed to get us to start researching infrasound. It's about to fail. Masha. My physical repulsion of you grows with every word you say. But mine for you doesn't. I have nothing to say to that. What should I do to make it less? I've already told you. Or make it more? Could I just have some time? Alone? Don't come near me. Everything's fucked. Dead right it is. My wife just told me to fuck off. Your wife told you to fuck off? But of course. When? Just now. Don't disturb the lovebirds. Trifonov, you dance very well. Thank you. I used to dance even better. Fucking smash it. You fucking spilled the lemonade. Spilled what? The lemonade. What a bastard. Are you acting like a beast now? The animal inside comrade Blinov. Masha. Masha. We are waiting to release the beast. You know nothing fragile will stay unbroken? Oh, that's wonderful. Including tables and chairs. Great apes are not really fragile. So I think we're entirely safe. They're encouraging destruction. It's nothing but talk. Let's start taking action. Yes, it's all talk. Blinov, this is all just compromises. Let's see the beast on a grand scale. Could we at least have a tiny demonstration? No, I'd like to see a big hairy beast. I've run out of honey. I thought you can't eat honey. You're right, I can't. You said you're allergic. Yes, my allergy's kicked in. It's started? Will it be alright? That's enough. No, it's not. You aren't allergic. I am. That's enough. What's this about? Enough, enough. Why? Your nose is running, you really do have an allergy. What's all this? You want to make a scene? You can smoke here in D1. Let's make tea. Don't fucking follow me. Time for bed, folks. Enough, folks, go take some rest. Good night. Didn't I make myself clear? Let me finish eating. Don't make us mad, go to sleep. Climb down. Climb down, then I'll climb down. I'm coming, go on. Professor, why do you think the woman does a somewhat mirrored reflection of the monkey's movements? This is an effort to recreate a sort of mirror in a surface. So, the effort of the human being now is to produce a mirror. A mirror? Exactly. That doesn't exist. In this case we replicate an animal. that came before us. He is the ancestor. Exactly, exactly. So it's a sort of journey also in time, if you want. But the goal is to produce an image. And the image is built with the animal, becoming an animal. Humanity is in many ways defined as animals that have shed most of their instincts. We can generate ideas and ways of behaviour. We don't generate instincts. See, other animals have lots of instincts. The wolves, they cannot kill another wolf who is yielding to them. If the other wolf is yielding, they can't kill it. They have an inhibition against it. The point is that pigeons, they kill each other. They don't have any inhibition. It seems that only very ferocious animals have such inhibitions. Human beings seem to have no inhibitions at all. Hello comrades. How is everything? We're great. Why is there no water in the kitchen? Talk to the facilities manager, sort it out. I will. Otherwise, they'll nag me. Good evening, comrades. Good evening. What do we have in here? We're studying the state of the rats. The state is pretty obvious. Do you have an experiment today? With them? Doubt it. We discussed the experiment with the labyrinth. I've been hearing about that for eight years, since I'm director. Blinov, what does this department do? As you're in charge. I am, but I can't tell you what they do. Even the Head of the Department has no idea. Work out what's going on with this wonderful rat lab and how useful it is within the strategy of research development within the Institute. Let's move on. I can see the active nucleus. Moving in time, down to the second. It's moving nicely. Nothing you have to say will surprise me. So no need to take so long plucking up the courage. Look, you're in love with me, that's a fact, but I really want to know what you want. How would you like our relationship to change in this context? What are you missing? I'm missing you. What do you mean? We see each other every day, no matter where you are. I wonder, is there anyone else you're missing? Another five or six people? That's what I really want to know. There's not just you. Is it with the same intensity? No. It's very different. I think it makes a big difference, when you're in love with several people, not one of which is your wife. It's nothing unusual, it's completely normal. It's harmless and it's fine. Actually, my wife is one. Wondeful, even better. But if you love her, then I just don't get it. Vasya, give me the glasses. I'll fucking say this again. When the ship is sinking, I want a drink. Go fuck yourself. And then to eat. How much? Just a bit. Don't talk shit. Ladies first. Fuck you. Here, Stepanovna. Here's to us meeting. I want to sleep with you today. Are you fucking nuts? Absolutely not. Stepanovna, here's to you. I'll drink this one for you, Palych. Go on then. Of course. Now move over. What the fuck, Palych? Don't let him move. Fucking hell. Pass your fucking glass. Shut your face. Hungry customers are waiting. Fuck them. Just a drop for me. That's enough. Go on then. Here's to your eternal youth. Ivan, are you fucking nuts? I'll always be young anyway. Stepanovna, eat something. You're in for a steamy night with Palych tonight. Come on to him, go on. Don't upset him or he'll lose his spirit. He's nice and wound up at the moment. Stepanovna, eat. I've eaten. That's your plate. Yes. Stepanovna. What? I thought I'd lost you. What's the matter? I can't go now, I can't leave Palych. Ivan, the kids are hungry. Head of Personnel took me away. Are you drinking? I can't go now, I can't leave Palych. Our fridge is leaking, mop it up. Ask that other girl. I'm busy now. Busy with drinking? But she's just sitting there. She's not a cleaner. It'll only take her a minute. Don't take me, I'm not leaving this. Come here, my girl. Now, we're talking. Vasya, give a glass. We can go together. I'll mop the floor for you. Here you go, Vika. Vika darling, they can wait. We'll drink to you, Vika. Why do you behave like this? It'll calm your nerves. Come on, don't fucking cry. What's the matter? I feel sorry for her. I'll go with her. You don't fucking feel sorry for Palych. For him, too. Stay Vika. Why the fuck did you polish off my vodka? But my boyfriend is sick. I'm a nurse, understand? Palych. It's got nothing to do with him. Just come and mop. Fuck it. That's right, good girl. What? Well done her. Vasya, sit down. Good day. Hello Zoya. Take a seat please. Thank you. Would you like some water or juice? Water. Very well. In the meantime, tell me, what's new. in the scientific work of the theoretical department? I'd like to hear more from you. I can't, you didn't ask me to prepare one. As scientific secretary you should know what's going on. Could you get Zoya some water? One more thing I'd like to discuss with you. Thank you. Thanks, Lyuba. It's your relationship with the academician Nikita Nekrasov. I'd love to talk about it. I'm getting unpleasant warning signs. As you know, Nikita is married. Yes, I know that. He has children. Them not living in Moscow doesn't change the situation. What situation? It's not only scientific meetings you have with him. You're in an intimate relationship. No, we're not. I strongly advise you not to give us cause for rumours about your relationship. I only see him for work matters. I've heard otherwise. Perhaps check that information. I'll check it again. But even if this information is unfounded. Please don't give cause for such information to arise. We're not in an intimate relationship. I await instructions on how not to give cause. Very well. They might come from the First Department. I'm on great terms with them, we'll understand each other. Thank you, Zoya. No, thank you. Everything working. What the fuck is this? Where's Vika? My boss. Ivan, what's with you today? First time I've seen him like this. Problems with the wife? Yes, fuck loads. You come home late, she doesn't put out. She doesn't, the bitch kicked me out. I've young, attractive men after me. You're old, sorry. Have you tried me, this old fuck? Vika darling. An old hog, fuck, an old dog, knows the best tricks. Yes, an old hog, that's right. Old hog. Oh, my. What a kebab. The fuck are you playing at? You bastard. You were standing so nicely. Stop it, Ivan. Fuck off. Mind your floor cloth there. Fuck you. Bastard. Dear God. I'm going mad. Vika, why the long face? No, everything's wonderful. Wonderful. It's just amazing. Vika darling, tell Ira... I love my job. Bon appetit everyone. Thanks, Lyonya. Edik, do you want a half? No thanks. Someone else has their eyes on it. Lyonya, help me out. Me? Yes. You wouldn't leave a friend in the lurch, would you? Go on, brother. I'm doing it. Don't fucking burn yourself. Vasya, a glass of champagne. Vasya, brother. Come here. Here, Vasya, turn around. Go on, brother. You like ice cream, don't you? Yes. Then you have that one. Join me then. I would've put some chocolate. Well, you should have. Look after yourself too. I didn't know it was for me. I do take care of the Institute's employees, especially those who report directly to me. Let's have a little chat about a few aspects of the job. Our Institute is an important part of the Academy of Sciences and also the entirety of Soviet industry and science. It plays an extremely vital role. So the task of the director's secretary is not just to type up orders and organise my meetings, but it's also to look after the emotional, physical and physiological well-being of your immediate superior. And those who do their work not just out of formality, those who put their heart and soul into it, are well looked after by the management. They get help with day-to-day problems, like housing problems. Plus it's nice to go on holiday, isn't it? To a resort? I don't get away to resorts much, mainly on work trips, sometimes abroad. You don't say. Yes, I do. It's always nice to travel with someone, to talk to someone you're close to. Not just formally about work, but also... Informally too? Informally, exactly. Your ice cream has melted. Not quite, let's try it. Not completely, but it's getting there. Now, you're a beautiful, modern young lady. Has there been a high staff turn over? Has there been a high turn over of staff? Some were promoted and others had to be fired. Unfortunately. Some left of their own accord. How's the ice cream? Pretty good. What about the chocolate? It's good chocolate. I made an effort. Did you? Yes. You can tell. Good. I put my heart into it. Did you? Wonderful. I really like it, when someone puts their heart into everything. Let's drink to our love. To our brotherhood. Down in one. You eat first. Excellent. Flipping delicious pickles. Did you make them? Did you take the meat off? Take it off. I am. Ira, you have such a beautiful figure. When I fucking look at you, I lose my head. Your figure isn't bad either. Fuck off, I'm with Vasya. Get out of here. I love you, my girl. I love another. What about Vika? She's lovely and lonely. Vika who? Our Vika, she's single, she suffers without love. But I love you. I fucking love you. I don't need Vika. Vika, I love Ira, not you. Don't be cruel. We've got an urgent order. Why are you always fucking bothering me? You're ruining my life. Let's have a fucking drink. Let's have another drink. Pour Stepanovna and me another one. None left. Then order more. Vika, give us some vodka. For fuck's sake, Ivan. A bottle of vodka. Vika. Ira. I love that woman. Fuck. I'll pay for a bottle of vodka. You've had enough. You just nearly killed me. I get all the orders done. Do you now? You just smoke and drink, Artyom does all the work. We're in love. We met by chance. Just one bottle. Can I get past? Can I get past? We're in love. We need a drink. What's the matter? You're not leaving till we get vodka. No way. Order her, Stepanovna. We want to get pissed. Like fuck am I leaving before morning. Give us a bottle. Ira, pass us a bottle of vodka. Fancy a drink, do we? It's the same every day. Here's your fucking vodka. Ivan, I'm fucking sick of you. How can you drink this much? Let me through. No way. We're in love. I can't fucking bear it any more. They just get drunk every day, and so do I. What's going on? I can't cope anymore. Fuck it. I can't do it. What? Why is she crying? Vika, what's happened? Try to calm her down. You're her friend. Yes, but I don't know why she's crying. Because we have no life, don't you understand? We want vodka. What can we do to make you feel better? I don't know. It just seems that way now. Vika. Here you go, Ivan. There we go. Now we'll calm down. Come on Vika, let's get out of here. Can you get up by yourself? Ira, give her some cold water. We already tried. You need some fresh air. What happened? I can't. Only forty more paces. Forty isn't that many, is it? It's not far at all. Only twenty paces left. No, I don't want to. I can't. Please, don't touch me. Closing your legs? No. I can't. But this is much nicer. No. Why cover yourself up Please, don't. Biting are we? You little minx. This is part of your secretarial duties. Why leave the skirt on? Please, for God's sake, let me go. No. Enough. Hello. Hello. Comrades. Comrade Karelsky has come to our Institute to carry out experimental and theoretical research. The Insitute supervisor will introduce him. Comrade Azhippo. Thank you. Comrades, this is Dr Karelsky, senior research fellow at the Psychiatric Institute. He specialises in the field of influencing the human consciousness and human behaviour in states of altered consciousness. His work focuses on studying and developing the human and superhuman potential of Soviet men, the builders of Communism. Dr Karelsky will now give a lecture and conduct a series of experiments with a group of voluntary test subjects. I'll hand over to him now. Thank you. Once again, hello everyone. Today, I'd like to discuss the new field of psychology which is called tranpersonal psychology. To briefly explain Modern transpersonal psychology is a new science and has an integrated approach. It combines all types of psychology with physics, history, anthropology, medicine and so on. The aim of this new scientific field is to combine different scientific approaches with ancient spiritual practices. But why ancient spiritual practices? Over the ages, humans have amassed huge potential through various methods and technologies to access sacred dimensions of existence. If we consider any ancient religious, philosophical tradition, we can always find means of self-healing and self-transformation. Guards. Guards. We should leave her alone. No one knows what to do. Let her calm down. And then later we'll talk to her. We don't need a ticking time bomb. She just had a nervous breakdown. She's just having a hard time. Ira, what happened? I'm still not sure, I didn't see. All I know is Vika was in despair. Happens to all of us now and then. She might do something. And then we'll lose one of our people. What could she do? She could've killed Ivan throwing that bottle. Pity she fucking didn't. This is funny. What is? It's hilarious. What? You think I'm sick, don't you? No. Why did you come? What do you want? I couldn't leave you in that broken glass. How old are you? 18. How old are you? I'm 32. Go back to the nice young girls. I like it out here. Please, go away. Where are you going? Just go away. I won't, I'm not going anywhere. And now take your first deep breath. And now let us focus our minds on this breathing session. Observe the tension present in your body. Travel in your mind's eye from the tips of your toes to the top of your head. And find any tension you are holding in your body. When you find tension, release it as much as you are able to. Relax. How many scientific advances were made by mistake? And these mistakes opened a new world. For example, how was the European way of doing china discovered? The man who tried to do it was an alchemist. And he failed in creating gold. So he created something by chance. Your breath becomes deeper and faster. And right now, you begin to rock on the waves of your breath. Let your feelings and emotions manifest themselves. Let them appear from the void and then return to the void. Perhaps you begin to see images in your mind's eye. Let them appear and disappear. Allow everything to be, in both your body and in your consciousness. Slowly, you set out on a journey. There is a story, it was in the Middle Ages. It was called "pons asinorum". And the idea was that there is some kind of a hidden well which has all kinds of good, great things in it. But to this well you can be led only by a blind donkey. So the question is: How many things in science, in other fields, were done by blind donkeys? May we? Yes, come in, comrades. Hello, Trifonov. Hello. Take a seat. Thank you. May I? Azhippo? Yes. Please don't consider me rude, but there's one thing I need to tell you. This new secretary girl you've hired... Have you done a proper check on her? Not yet, but she works well, puts her soul into it. You see... What's the problem? There are certain details, which make us wonder. She graduated from an economics institute and immediately went to work to the HR Department. Who's behind her? Why did she get this job? She probably volunteered to cooperate. Then straight after HR, she came here. I don't want to explain, it's your business. But I advise you to keep her at arm's length. You might not be aware of certain nuances. In my knowledge, none of our secretaries has ever worked for our Institute only. It's pretty clear what certain security services expect from Comrade Lyuba. It would be strange not to give them some information. They are our colleagues and we all work together, and if they want to get information like that, let them. Actually that isn't exactly the problem. If you analyse our situation here in the Institute, then in general, it's not a pretty picture. What do you mean? Some of the management have been noticed behaving tactlessly towards women. Then there are these incomprehensible dances with their Western leanings. Just look at the furniture. What is it even? The furniture comes from our comrades in the GDR and Czechoslovakia. Just imagine if all of this gets into the Western press, the angle they'll take on Soviet scientists. Wait a second, Western newspapers are within the remit of the First Department. What do you mean by tactless behaviour? You know full well about the rumours going round. No, there are two separate issues here. It's one situation when a man and a woman have an extramarital affair by mutual consent. I even know comrades in the Central Committee... This is off topic. They also aren't married and conduct their relationships like that. To be tactless towards women is entirely different. Let's call things by their names: Sexual harassment, that's what it is. That's anything leaving the limits of mutual consent. That's what harassment is. You have to be aware about the way you breathe. Remember to breath deeper and faster. Always be present in the act of breathing and in the process of communication. Let the communication be spontaneous. You're simply following your inner impulses, Simply liberating your essence. Now you're unifying your social and animal nature. Is this your way of sorting things out? I just think this confuses things even more. Do you sleep with all the women you have feelings for? There aren't that many women who I have feelings for. And do you sleep with all of them? No. No? But you want to try? Yes. Why? To test your feelings? I have a longing for you. Wonderful. That's just how it is. It's a question of how you feel. I'm not a robot, I have a longing for you too. But what can we do about it? I really want you so much, Zoya. I really don't get it. Neither do I. Uncle Nikita, Auntie Zoya. Come through for some tea, if you can. Yes, thanks, we're just coming. Thanks, Denis. Alright, I'll leave you be. Don't, Nikita. Stop it, I mean it. Uncle Nikita. How do you feel about lab rats? In a sense, we're all lab rats. It's interesting, I got to see the lab rats a while ago. I stroked them and tried to move them cage to cage. The result was so funny. What was the result? At first they just sniffed around. They just sort of ran into each other, then fell away from each other. And then they became friends. Their personalities didn't match. And then they did. Or they'd have eaten each other. That's idiotic. They have no feelings at all. They can't love, they don't make friends. A mum can even eat her kids. It's so interesting. Imagine if that happened with people. Maybe during the famine before the revolution. Maybe then a mother could eat her children. I learnt that in history, but it's hard to imagine. But rats do eat their babies. Not only do they live much less time than us, just one or two years, but they also have no feelings. It's like God made them wrong. It's hard to understand. He didn't give them feelings, just animal instincts. They live completely independently of one another. I found it really interesting. I just thought rats had lost out somehow. From our point of view, yes. But not from theirs? They must think we've lost out in some respects. Yes, perhaps. Sonya from the lab said, that people are much crueler than rats. More so than an animal. Than any animal. Animals only kill out of necessity. Dad's coughing. He's coughing? Yes. Go ask him if he needs any water. Alright. Thanks. And if he wants breakfast. Nikita, Zoya, will you wait for him if he comes down? You won't leave, will you? We'll see. I'll ask him to have breakfast with us. That would be the right thing to do. Has something happened? No, nothing new. I see. It's just that Nikita is going away Yes, I know. Otherwise, nothing new. Take care, Auntie Zoya. Thank you Denis. Bye. I hope you'll come back soon. I definitely will. Thank you. Bye. There's our chef, Ivan. He's the main meat expert. If you want some delicious meat, ask him. Well, now I know. People here have all sorts of eccentricities. But they're quite sweet and harmless ones. It's good to be eccentric. Yes, wonderful. Imagine if we were all the same. How boring it would be. Your eyes are shining. Good evening, comrades. I would like to inform you about the political situation that's been unfolding in Czechoslovakia over the last year. So that no one has any misunderstandings regarding the reasons that compelled the military forces of the Warsaw Pact to enter into Czechoslovakia, thus preventing a possible takeover by NATO. In late '67, early '68 personnel replacements took place in Czechoslovakia. The comrades who came to power evidently showed excessive liberalism. through the ranks of the Czechoslovak Communist Party a revisionist sentiment took root. Under the guise of further democratisation, a very strange slogan was advanced: "Building socialism with a human face" As if there were other faces of socialism that we have in the other socialist countries. I don't know what our Czech comrades were thinking. Then the newspapers in Czechoslovakia started openly publishing anti-Soviet articles and announcing the need for radical change in the political ideology of Czechoslovakia. After the Warsaw Pact troops were sent in a mutual understanding was reached about how Czechoslovakia should remain in the socialist camp. I think developing further scientific and cultural links will help normalize the situation in Czechoslovakia. Can I say something? As Palych is so eager to speak, let's hear him out. As a war veteran, I know where it's come from. In the events in Hungary in 1953. Maybe 1956? Right, 1956. So it stems from there because... How can I put it? We had a confrontation with the USA. We are the most powerful state, but we've let things get a bit out of hand here. Over there they are used to having private property and things like that. So we let the ideology slip a little. I swear, for the life of me. Many people died for their ideas there. Luckily almost no one died. But our Soviet Union is unshakeable. Nobody will defeat us, and that's that. That was from the heart. Of course it was. Comrades, the Cold War continues. This is an echo of it. It means that the plotting by the Western secret services will increase. They'll have our Institute in their sights. So I ask all employees to heighten secrecy. If you notice anything suspicious, report it immediately to the First Department. That is all from me. Comrade Kaledin. Yes, I'll speak. Palych correctly mentioned Hungary. But the situation was different in Hungary. A Stalinist worse than Stalin was in power. He was in power a long time and killed many people. He was eventually removed, but that then wasn't enough. As a result, there appeared other people from the other end of the spectrum but just as cruel. People were being killed in the streets. So military intervention was the only solution. But Czechoslovakia wasn't like that. From what's been reported, there was no violence, just simple, peaceful people who wanted to live in peace. To eat their soup, their dumplings, go to the pub in the evening. I think it's just a generational thing. Time has passed since the war and this new generation just want to live their lives. But now's no time to speak of "human faces" and calmly eat one's dumplings. As soon as someone starts wanting a quiet life, I get scared, because it won't end well. "The way you imagine a Parisian lady" "With pearl-peppered neck, diamond-decked hand..." "Forget all of that, life's crueller, more seedy" "My Parisian girl's of a quite different brand" "Whether young or old I cannot say" "She's polished to yellow, rude yet fair" "In a restaurant toilet she toils for her pay" "It's a small restaurant, The Grande-Chaumiere" "Washing my hands stand I at the sink" "Stinking potpourri potions are all I can smell" "I look at the lady, at a loss what to think" "I want to say to the mademoiselle" "Mademoiselle, I'm sorry, you're a pitiful state" "Aren't you sad to waste your youth in a loo?" "About Parisian girls I've been lied to of late" "Please do excuse my out-gnashing of verse" "And depictions of piss-puddled floors" "But in Paris for women it's worse" Hi, comrades. "To be serving than working as whores" I need some company. Take a seat. Lads, move over and give her some space. Give us a song. "In peril on a stormy sea" "The boat's doom is almost certain" "Today, those from the bourgeoisie" "Are hid behind their curtains" Lyonya, go on. Vika, do you want some tea? Do you want tea? Is there anything stronger? Let's drink to... I don't want to teach you anything. I'm still a child. What are we drinking to? To being masters of our own destinies. He was playing footsie. I pushed Vika's leg, accidently. What's the problem? I wasn't flirting, I brushed against it. He's blushing, look. Shuffle your foot round a bit more under the table. I can't do it, I'm in slippers. Did you do it? I feel much better now, for the time being, at least. Don't be scared. It's just how your maid opens champagne. Sounds like it's not from the fridge, judging by the force of the pop. It's the first time I've opened champagne. You should go to the canteen to learn it. To do a course. To learn to work with bottles . I've always been too scared. Strictly speaking, only Dau is allowed a maid, so she should be properly qualified. Nora, there's something I'd like to discuss. You may not have noticed, since you spend your time here, but recently, I've been inundated with work. I can't remember when I had a holiday. And I've been trying to sleep in my office, rather than going home. But I can't sleep there, because it's where I work. So. Cheers. To Dau's health. Yes, to Dau's health. I'll clink with my fingers as I don't drink. That's good, Denis. It's for the best. I wanted to say, because Dau's less active now... And as you said, there are fewer people here now. I need somewhere here where I can get some rest. So if you don't mind, that room, usually for servants... What I mean is I'd like to use it, because I don't always manage to go home. I need somewhere that matches my status. I can't really move everyone from D1, can I? They're not very friendly there anyway. No, they're not. I don't think Dau will mind. Dau, would you mind if I stayed here sometimes? Alright? Thank you. When Anya comes back, we'll have to tell her, that I'm not very fussy person day-to-day, but I have some basic needs like washing, ironing, what I eat and drink. Of course. I also wanted to ask you something. So if you do come to stay here... I remember you when you were young. Look, we're close, and I know your inclinations. So can we do without secretaries and scandals? Let's say this. As we both know what I'm like. You know I never promise what I can't do. Let's say that if I do bring someone here, they won't come into any contact with you three. We'll have our space in that room. And it won't at all affect what goes on in here. Where will Anya stay? We'll come up with something. Is there a spare room upstairs? No. Then maybe... D1 is being extended, we'll move Anya there. Just over the road. D1? Yes, why not? Anya. But why? This isn't right. Anya, it's no big deal. The comrades there, nobody will hurt you. I want to live with Anya, we're good together. I can't, I wake up and see that face. Anya could move into your room, if Nora allows it. Whose face, Anya? Let's put two beds together. Anya will still be here to do her work. Why should she work and live in different places? Are you happy for her to live in your room? I am. I think you both want that. Anya will sleep there and come here in the morning. When you have your own maid you can decide. Have you seen how our other academicians live? Their families don't have a room each. Do you have nowhere to live? He needs somewhere to rest. I'm always at the Insitute. Morning to evening, through the night. I'm sorry, but sleeping in my office is not convenient. And don't use that tone with your mother and me. And with your father. Fuck me, checked trousers. They'll look lovely. He could do with some checked underpants too. And matching codpiece. The trousers are a bit small. He's lost weight. He can't get his crown jewels in. He might wear a prison uniform soon. He's a deputy, he'll be fine. Yes, but perhaps he won't be a deputy forever. He has to answer for his actions. Remember when we saved his skin? With that rape charge against him? Where would he be if it wasn't for us? An immoral man, with the makings of a sex offender. As a scientist he's a nobody. He's nothing. Everyone knows he's a waste of space. He's a public figure. He's a clown. Are we going to tolerate all this? What can you do? Report his behaviour. We've never done that, have we? I have done. But not in writing? I have, Pasha. Yes? I reported on him and gave examples of his depravity. Somehow it was hushed up. Hello? Servant of God, take the body and blood of Christ for forgiveness of sins and life everlasting. Open your lips. Open your mouth. Eat this, close your mouth. And eat. There you go. And now you're going to drink. Careful. One more. That's it. We thank Thee, O Lord, that Thou made us worthy to partake of Thy Holy Mysteries. Make straight our path, strengthen us. Guard our life, make firm our steps Through the prayers of the Mother of God and all saints To Thee, O God, we ascribe glory. To the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Now and forever. Amen. It is wonderful to worship Thee, Mother of God. Thou, the ever blessed and most pure Mother of God, more honour than the Cherubim, more glorious than the Seraphim, who gave birth to God the Word. O Mother of God, we exult thee. Glory to the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Now and forever. Amen. Lord have mercy, bless us. God be with you. We ask for atonement of our sins. We ask it in every prayer. All finished. The point is that, at least the repentence, should be as strong as the sin. Everything went fine. Many times it's not the same thing. Goodbye. Our sinning is done with gusto, with great good will. And the repentance is done otherwise. You sin when you are young and you repent when you are old. This is not the same person. Apologies for not knocking, but the matter is very urgent. Just give me five minutes. You have one minute exactly. Can you make me some hot chocolate? Azhippo, take a seat. What's so urgent then? Well, a few things really. To be brief, the file I have on you containing material that compromises you, hasn't got any thinner the past few years. I would like to remind you of a few details that I have managed to look over. It still contains a statement from a woman whom you tried to rape. Statements that you have forced women subordinate to you into intimate relations. Multiple cases of misconduct and abuse of power. Spending state funds on you and your family. All these little things have piled up in there. I just want to remind you of that. I don't doubt the efficacity of our security services. And I know that if you wanted to, even in the absence of transgressions. Not that anyone is completely innocent. At least, no one I've ever met. If you wanted to, in theory, you can apply certain pressures to anyone, regardless of how much they have transgressed. Comrade Trifonov, the purpose of my visit is not a discussion with you, as interesting as that is and I'm sure we'd get to some truth in that. Sadly, the purpose of my visit is quite different. I want to familiarise you with some documents. Unfortunately, they're not very pleasant for you. This is hot of the press, practically steaming. Please have a read of this. From August 21st? The decision was made a while ago. You weren't informed, only a few people knew. This unpleasant task fell to me, as we've known each other a long time. If this was fifteen or twenty years ago, I'd have brought you a gun with one bullet. Fortunately, times have changed. That's why I'm suggesting you write a resignation letter. Any wording will do. Something to suit all parties. What do you think? I'm to vacate my post? Yes, voluntarily. Do I have a couple of days? No, you need to do it now. But the decision was made on August 21st. The decision was a long time coming. You're telling me over twenty days later. This wasn't my idea, it's just as unpleasant for me. That's why it has to be done right now. So take some paper and write it. I can make some suggestions. Perhaps you "want to pursue something creative". Do you have paper? Don't you? No, I write in notepads. Let's use this one. To Comrade Keldysh? Yes. "To the President of..." and so on. Forgive my handwriting. That's alright. Thank you. Of course, you may not feel like working now, but please don't tell anyone yet. All right. Forgive me. It's just a regular situation at work. Thank you. Goodbye. Yes? Where's the hot chocolate I asked for? Dear Comrades. It is our good fortune to live and work in the days of developed Socialism. New universities are being opened as well as schools and nurseries. Factories and plants are being built, stadiums and Palaces of Culture too. On July 1st this year in Moscow, London and Washington the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was signed. A great achievement for Soviet diplomacy. A meaningful step towards international friendship and the provision of worldwide peace. That said, the international and domestic situation requires us Soviet people to remain vigilant. Treacherous acts are observed in some socialist countries. There is unrest in capitalist countries, too. A tremendous army of Western spies works day and night to encourage these sentiments to permeate the Soviet Union. There are those in our country susceptible to these provocations. There are traitors in the USSR, and slanderers too. It's especially distressing to find such people amongst our scientists, Soviet physicists, nuclear physicists. In light of such conditions the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences has considered it fit, to accept the resignation of Institute Director, Trifonov and release him from this post at his own request. The new Director of the Institute, as appointed by the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences, on September 13th, 1968, is Comrade Azhippo. Comrade Azhippo is an ardent Communist. He's an experienced organiser. He came up through the ranks of the Cheka to become Major General of State Security. He has exposed many saboteurs and prevented many crimes. We all know Comrade Azhippo as a warm, wise, thoughtful person. I am sure these qualities will guarantee his successful leadership of the Institute. Thank you for the kind words, Alexander. As a modest person I am not used to this, but I'd like to highlight a few issues that I would like to focus on in my work. I fully recognise that creative processes, moments of scientific inspiration and our necessary restrictive security measures have always contradicted each other. That's why I'm counting on you to help me strike a balance between these very different aims. Sort of a middle ground. I will keep thinking about it and will be obliged for any help from you. If you have any questions, please go ahead. Trifonov, tell us. Why did they decide to change the management? Did they give you a reason? I'd actually been asking for a while. It's all actually very simple. A person faces two main temptations in life: Power and freedom. I prefer to be tempted by freedom. That's all. Don't dodge the question. I'm not, let's drink. To what? To freedom. Let's drink. To both yours and ours. And to yours. Good night. Good night. Masha, I'm off. Oh yes. This one was perfect. Azhippo, join us at the table. One minute. Good evening. Good evening. It's very smoky and noisy in here. You may not all know me, but I'm the new Director. My name is Comrade Azhippo. How can I put this? You're enjoying yourselfs a little too much. You need to be more measured. Stop the music, no smoking inside and I think it's time for bed. We'll just air the room. Yes, do. Plus, you're smoking something rotten. One moment. Kristina, write down the surnames of everyone here. No, hold on. Your surname? Kubrak. First name? Dmitry. Perfect. You, young lady? I'm Kristina. A lovely name. Do you have a surname? Yes. Let's write you in. Let me say it in your ear. Babich. Let's arrange a meeting tomorrow. And I'd like you to invite the people who left so quickly. Very well. Two go there. That chair goes there. That's it, all good, thank you. Did you forget to remove these? We will. We'll get rid of all these things. We can breathe in here now. This maze. This way, that way. May we? Yes, please. Good day, Comrade General. Hello. Allow us to convey our team's congratulations. Well, you know... I know what you mean. We wish you well. All the best in your new position. Thank you, we'll have a drink later. A few words about our youngsters. Given the circumstances, I can't be too hard on them. I am the director, I need to act like a kind daddy. But I've put them on the right path now. They're bright, they got it. They look scared. Scared, yes, but not overly so. They still smile a bit. Please talk to them each separately. Be as harsh as possible. No need to beat them though. But be as strict as you can be. Don't pity them, not even the quiet ones. Can we cut their hair? Let them do that themselves. I'll do it, in a fatherly way. Yes, do. Go in fucking hard, so they get the picture. it used to be all roses, but now it's time for thorns. Understood. Good bye. Close the door. It's not going to close itself, is it? Come and sit, Palych. I love this one. Quiet, quiet. This is a concert. When you have your concert we'll all come. Can you play something modern? I'll show you how the young composers in the conservatoire write music they think is very novel. They try to make up new piano techniques. It's all crap. Palych, my point exactly. I want to demonstrate how much crap it is. Let's play along, come on. And we're off. And tap on your head. Here we go. Then it develops. On the table. A young Soviet scientist should look proper. You should wear a solid colour. Have a smart haircut, not this mophead. And your lifestyle should be appropriate too. Without any abuse of alcohol and cigarettes. No staying up all night. What did you smoke yesterday? Nothing. Nothing? I've never smoked in my life. Really? I give you my word. What does that mean? I give you my word. Do you know this? Where do they do this? I don't know. What does it mean? Something like "I swear"? It's a sign that former and current convicts use. So, my friend. I see. Don't fucking cut me off. You'll probably end up there. Why? You're a good kid, but following the fashion ruins you. Those bizarre trousers of yours are not Soviet. Do you know what goes woof-woof-woof? A bitch. Know what a bitch is? It's an animal. An animal. A prison bitch is a convict who plays the woman's role amongst the inmates. He lives that role, they rape him. Don't pretend to be surprised. He sleeps on the floor, or under the bunk, takes out the slops, cleans, makes the beds, buys cigarettes from the prison shop, fetches food. He has to serve thirty to sixty men. Then at night, he serves as well. As a woman. That might await you if you're kicked out of here. Sit down. Want a haircut? What do you mean? A haircut with blunt scissors? No, why? Will you do it yourself? Yes, there's a barber shop. Will you do it yourself? Or shall I cut a cross into your head? I'll go to the barber. And change those fag trousers. Hang on. Here. Do you have a pen? Yes. Now write the following. "A pledge". "I", then your surname and initials. Done? Yes. "hereby declare" "that I will secretly cooperate" Keep writing. Can you tell me what I'm agreeing to? To secretly cooperate with the KGB. In a year or two, you'll get a full-time job with the state security services. In the same line of work you're in now. Do you want to work for the KGB? No, I want to be a scientist. Do they do science in the KGB? Of course. Do they study set theory? The Director of our Institute is a KGB General. What does that tell you? A lot. But I'd like to continue at Moscow State University. You will. You can do both. I'm sure we can transfer you. Write. I'd rather not. Petya, you silly little boy. The KGB's in every university. We'll write to them, and everything will be ruined. But cooperate and we'll monitor you. Why? I don't want to be monitored. I just want to study. You're already being monitored. You'll be monitored your whole life, because you signed the non-disclosure agreement. Wherever you work we'll always be monitoring you. So sign it, change your clothes, and cut your hair. I'd rather just change my clothes and cut my hair. Let's give him a haircut. Let's cut out a cross on his head. Cut that fringe off. Sit back. There. I won't fucking work. Who's going to do it? Vasya? Ruslan. The dishes. Ira wants you to wash the dishes. I don't know. What do you mean? Wash it. Thank you, Ivan. Ruslan, just do it. It's not a big job. Go and clean the motherfucking dishes. There are no cups for the tea. Give Ira a lemon. First I'll have a fucking drink. Pour him one. Let him fucking down this one. There you go. Wash the dishes. Ivan, I can't stand it any more. We need that glass back. I want lemon. Give him some lemon. Feels like a hen party. Hello, Comrade Director. It's too late to hide that now. The working day's finished. Yes, the working day's finished. and it's time to leave the workplace. I get it, I really do. This is the smoking area, not the drinking area. There's even a sign. After you. Would you like some tea? No, thanks. And you? Another coffee. Sorry to interrupt, Comrade Director. Just a moment. Comrade Fokin. I've already asked you. Tell your staff to leave. They're waiting to be told to clock off. Can they wait not together? As you wish. They're a bit rowdy. It's a habit of a lifetime. Let's break the habit. Yes, we'll do so. Let them go. More than happy to. That's all, thank you. You're quite a smoker, aren't you, Palych? Where did you get drugs? Out with it. Friends from Kiev. Who? Surname. Can't remember. How can you not remember? Who? Tell me, or I'll box your ears. Kristina, write, write, write. Well? Who? Honestly, I don't remember the surname. You having a memory lapse? Honestly, I don't remember. I don't know them well. Are you a masochist? No. What's all this then? Do you like getting smacked about? No? Tell us then. I don't like using women as a punchbag. I really don't remember. I'll hit you, honestly. I believe you. I'll hit you in the ear. It will hurt, believe me. Who was it? Pasha, or Petya, or something, I don't know. He just gave you drugs? Had you smoked before? I'd tried it. And he gave more to try? Yes, just to try. Or to sell? No way. You're sure? You have his address? His phone number? We just meet from time to time. When will you see each other next? We never call. How do you meet then? We have mutual friends. Who are they? Who are your mutual friends? Ears intact still? Intact? What about this one? You're scum. You're scum, hear me? Catch my drift? Kristina. Idiot. Stupid cow. Get a grip, sit up and write. "From K.U. Babich, a trainee" "I met a guy in Kiev called Pasha" "He gave me, at my request" "a bag of weed as a sign of affection" Has Azhippo invited you? For a drink. I don't think we'll make it. By the time we've dealt with these brats. "The bag contained cannabis" "And I brought it to the Institute in Moscow" "In the living quarters, I offered it to" "my acquaintances" If you ever do anything like this ever again. You'll have no excuse. Got it? If any such situation arises, you're sensible, you'll recognise a crime. Yes. Please inform us about it. Just inform us. Is that clear? Shall we let her go? Take this. Put it in your pocket and have it later. Yes? Don't you get what you've done? We control your every step. You'll be on the train to Siberia before too long. Are you fucking mad? Or just thick? Sit down and write. Please take off your glasses. See, this is surely not the right thing to say in any place, but I think the notion of giving the second cheek, is not a moral idea. It doesn't really matter if you are guilty or not. Giving the second cheek is an immoral act. It means you encourage somebody who is an agressor. Why should you? Let them suffer. Hello. Come in Dmitry. Coffee? Tea? Cognac? Tea. Kristina, a cup of tea for our guest. Dmitry, do people of different races have an equal ability to prevail in terms of knowledge and skills to become superhumans? We won't use the word "superhuman". As it's tainted by a certain ideology. Let's say "person with super abilities". What do you think? Well. I think different ethnicities and races, have different skills in different spheres. You can't say, one race is better than another, as "better" or "worse" must be about a certain characteristic. If we take sense of rhythm and aptitude for sport, we have to admit the black race is better adapted. In terms of physics, maths, and technical inventions, all this was done by the white race. This isn't an evaluation, it's just the facts. That said, it wasn't even the whole white race, but mainly the English, French, Germans and Russians who made most scientific discoveries. Italians too. All discoveries which changed the world. It's not that some people were ruling over others. Up until the seventeenth century, Africa was not part of Europe's colonial system. That happened in the following centuries. Nobody was hindering Africa's development, but they didn't develop like the white people did. That's the whole matter. Aren't you worried you're approaching to the ideology professed by Hitler? In particular, his Theory of National Socialism. Aren't you approaching that? I'd like to add that history shows that Hitler and his ideology lost in the end. This is a very complex point. If a certain realisation of an idea, caused something terrible, that doesn't necessarily cast doubt on the justificaton for certain ideas. So if certain ideas of mine call to mind ideas from the Third Reich, they can't be rejected on that basis. Yes, it's foolish to reject a doctrine outright. You can find a grain of truth everywhere. I may disagree with you on some of the details, that's only natural. But the direction of your research is close to some of the research conducted in our Institute. I expect working with us will benefit you and you'll help us too. The benefit will be mutual. They're all like that. What happened to you? You'll get the same tomorrow. Then we step and turn. Now you step. Now you step towards me. Then to the side and turn. And into the wall. Now they'll bring me a toothbrush. Fima. What? What's a toothbrush got to do with anything? Hard to say, if I don't say what a toothbrush is for. Is it just for brushing teeth? What's it got to do with this situation between us? We'll brush our teeth, have a wash, and then I'll put you to bed. When I'm sure you're sound asleep, I'll also go to bed. Sleeping is very interesting. Dreams are interesting. That was very unexpected. That's precisely why I wanted to put you to bed. You kept saying that it was very strange. And it really is. What else could I expect from such a strange guy who's into his mathematics. Did you always think me strange? You're all strange. How? You think differently. For example? Everything in your heads is different. I can calculate an integral. Yes, I can't. Lots of people say that. What actually is an integral? It's an area under a graph. And what's its function? If you know a car is moving at a speed that isn't constant, it's not easy to find the distance travelled. But it's very simple using of integral. That's such a stupid example, I'm ashamed to say it. Do you sleep with two pillows? Yes. You're used to it? I sleep with pillows. You can lie down next to me. I'll leave tomorrow. Why? It's time to study. Goodnight. Goodnight. So here we go, that's our test subjects. The purpose of this experiment is to see how transcranial magnetic stimulation could bring forth extraordinary capabilities to some kids, and to others a possible cure and capability of a normal human life. So I suggest we commence. Here we're collecting and recording the data. And here we have the effect of it. Is it only pleasurable feelings? No. In this instance of our procedure we're trying to develop mathematical abilities and enhance the analytical capabilities of the brain. James Fallon, from the University of South Carolina. He's a Professor of Neurophysiology. One idea's that the perfect human is somebody, who has everything in balance. There are savants who have tremendous IQ for specific tasks. So if your idea is that you want to create a group of geniuses who know one thing. That are great at music, counting things. That's a different task than taking a person and making what's called a perfect person. A perfect person balances their capabilities in their whole brain. One goal is to balance reinforcement pleasure centres with those that have to do with anxiety and fear. These two are very important. You could have a very very smart person who would have no sense of survival. So they could be brilliant but they would have no sense of protecting themselves. They'd be easy to kill. You're all dull and boring. Dull, boring, wild, crazy and impossible. Your wildness is just showing off. You just go around pretending to be crazy. You don't know how to drink and to have fun. You came over here, Vika, so we will show you. Will you? Alright, show me. You wanted to dance, right? Let me just finish this. Is that your way of smoking? Now this really is fun. Let's smash some plates. That is really good fun. This is much more fun. Fima, darling. Hello. Fima, Fima. You're against drinking, aren't you? Go on then, destroy the damn thing. I will. Are you going to clean up, Fima? Are you upset now? Will you clean up? No. Why not? Now you can dance, Vika. Come on children, wake up. You can have some fun. I know what you're hinting at. I'm not hinting at anything. No. So you don't want anything? You've spun me round too much. What's dripping on me? It's not me. Give it to me. Come on, get with it, quickly. I want you to give it back. There, that's what you want. That's the only thing that matters for you, right? Yes or no? Want it or not? Yes. You want it? Fine, good luck. He's upset because we smashed the crockery. Sure, he's fucking upset. Calm it. Idiot. This here is called Orbital Cortex. This is the orbit. So this is Orbital Cortex. This area when it's damaged along with, in the Temporal Lobe, the Amygdala and the Hippocampus. In this whole emotional cortex, an ancient cortex. This area helps you put together the emotional value of what you're doing, both for yourself, but for other people. So this has to do with how you interact with people. If this isn't there, you don't care about other people. But it can help you behave very quickly. It can make you appear more like a perfect person because you're so fast, you're so bright. Because the brake is not on. Right now, in these babies, this area is just starting to develop. In the first year they're very selfish. I wrote a paper on psychopaths and one of the chapters of the paper was: "My two-year-old granddaughter is a psychopath" In a sense the perfect, brilliant person is a two year old. They don't care if they hurt other people. They just want to eat. Can one turn this off in an adult? Yeah. It can be turned off by a gene, it can be turned off by a tumour, by electrical stimulation. What if you turn it off in a soldier? You probably want a soldier to turn that off. You want them not to be thinking about anything other than killing the other person. What makes you happy? What makes me happy? When others are truly happy. When others are truly happy? Can you make me feel happy? I just want to make you happy. Thank you. If you're happy, I'm happy. In order for me to be happy, I have to make you happy. You said you're happy when others are happy. But I don't know how to make you happy. I know. You're too direct, Vika. I'm so direct that Edward is doing all he can to wriggle out of it. But then he is young. Shall I put you to bed? I'll put you to bed. No, I don't want you to. You want to? Whatever you want. I don't want to. I won't force you. Quite the contrary. Contrary to what? Is that what you're talking about? What else could an old man desire? Could there be anything sweeter in old age? Than a little masochism? Than the violation of youth. Just a little bit. "Each of our meetings sadly our fate undermines" "Mournfully murmurs the brook passing by amber pines" "Shyly the ashes have covered the coals of our fire" "Everything's ended, against us the hours do conspire" Shut up. "Darling, darling dear" "Alina, beam of sunshine, Tell me where, oh where" Curl up and die. "Shall we meet again?" "Darling dear, beam of woodland sunshine" "Tell me where, oh where" "shall we meet again?" You can only feed from them. You can only take from them. They're still young, they cannot give. You have to suck it from them. They have so much energy and light. And that's rare and very hard to come by. Just try to enjoy it. It's hard for me, to take like that. I'm not used to that. Yes, it's tricky. I'm the same, it's easier to give. Or to just lie back and be taken. Salud. You're not having any? Not at the moment. What's that? Now, no. Not at this moment. It's good. Jim, you're a psychologist, a neurophysiologist. An expert in many disciplines. Could you deduce things by looking at me? Describe my past, let's say? You're a physiologist, but are experienced in many things. So you, looking at Vladimir here. Can you give us your impression about Vladimir's past? About your past? Your past? Yes. I think. I think you're a tough son of a bitch. You're a tough person. I think you are a fearless person, but I think you're a very thoughtful person. And that everything you've had to do, you've thought about a lot. You're a person who probably had to do some tough things. And did them as a matter of duty. As a job that you had to do. And I assumed you were a prison guard, maybe also in the army. I think you think you could've been on either side of the prison door. Because I think you lived life at the edge and it involved violence. You have some thrill-seeker in you too, generally. Without it you might be bored. Not that you need to kill anybody or fight. You need a lot of stimulation to make life interesting. So I think you bore easily. So I think you get bored easily. Get fed up of things quickly? Yes. I see. You need a lot to stop you getting bored. I have to admit that Jim has quite amazed me. Am I really so easy to read? I wish I was more private, protected. It takes one to know one. I am particularly amazed by Jim's phrase: "You could end up on either side of the prison door" Working in prisons meant I saw a lot of death. I had to take part in torture. Sometimes people died during this torture. For example, one very serious torture method was: A person would have his hands tied behind his back. Actually not behind his back, but under his knees. Then a crowbar was put under his arms. Then he was put in between the backs of two chairs. And he hung in the air in this position. Was there a manual of this? Or would they do it ad lib? No, it was an illegal method, though it was secretly encouraged. And with him in this helpless position his mouth was forced open. And using a file... It's what a metal worker uses. I know. I don't know the English... Perhaps say it's a metal worker's tool? This tool you use to sharpen wood, for example. I forget the English term. Sharpener? With this file the prisoner's tooth enamel was filed away. They'd be in a lot of pain, screaming. But that was normally used as punishment, not to get information. Not for information but for punishment for a specific act. Good luck in your work. It was great, but that's it. We're leaving now. Will you come back? No. That bad, eh? Bye. Vika darling. Goodbye. "Darling, darling dear." Goodbye. "Tell me where, oh where" "Shall we meet again?" I think it will be quite easy. The tallest guy was the one who spoke to us. Hands on your pelvis, rotate your pelvis. Each direction ten times. They make good fried potatoes. Too much oil in the salad though. Have you seen the cook? It's to make everyone fat. It's very difficult to stir up the youth into revolution. Like it was after World War One. But it needs to be done, under any flag. I don't think it's as difficult as you think. I believed that too up to a point, until those young, thinking people came here. They're not even capable of causing proper dabauchery. I encouraged them. And? I said, "Kaledin, you called on me" "to bring about worldwide revolution." Were you listening? When I was speaking to the young people? Come on, sit down. A matter needs resolving. Which one? That of the worldwide revolution. It's too late, Fedya. He says it's too late, I say it isn't. I say we can do it right now. This is our last chance. Maybe at some point in any case. I agree, definitely. Something will have to happen. First, we need a national revolution. I know what our blood is calling us to. It's calling us to minimal national separation. We should draw up borders, between our egos, according to what our language says. What are you talking about? Lots of different things. What are you arguing about? About revolution. And? We're not even arguing. Which revolution are you talking about? The future revolution. All the Soviet Republics shoud be free. Fedya, you're boring the girls. Why are you going on about this? Who would you rather I bored? Why did you bring the rats to the table? It's revolting, they smell of urine. We eat at that table, it's disgusting. Listen, how about you go upstairs and I'll come join you? Where? To our room. We haven't spoken for a while. Fedya, come back later. Girls, could I have the chopping board? Actually, in honesty, I've killed about three thousand rats, but I love them, I do love them. Thanks guys. That's the truth. "California, here I come." He's a jazz rat man. Good evening. Please, speak a little louder. Hello. Dau. Shall we say "How do you do?" All together? These guys are all in an experimental group. We're very pleased to meet you. They've come to meet you and introduce themselves. How is your health? He feels much better now. We're already on the path to recovery. Soon, he'll be back to work. Sorry, but how long has he been like this for? Quite a long time. But he's now making progress. He's taking his first steps, with great joy, you could say. He's started seeing a lot more of his friends, he's started trying to do things again, to think about things. We're all very hopeful, that soon he'll be fighting fit. How are you feeling, Dad? Denis, all of them are sportsmen It would be good for you to sit down How are you feeling, Dad? Denis is asking how you're feeling. Good. Does your son work in science? No, I'm studying at the conservatory. That's a science of sorts. You can tell he's talented. A layabout, more like. Don't be silly. Will he regain his speech? Of course. It's just a slow process. Like recovery from a sporting injury, it takes time. We do daily exercises, don't we? I'm always amazed by how injured sportsmen manage to recover from, say, a broken leg in a week. I don't know how you can run a marathon again after that. Willpower plays a significant part. If someone wants to return to what they do. Dau has willpower, of course. Well, that will help him then. Shall we go downstairs for some tea? Shall we leave you in peace? If you need us you can call us with your bell. Or you could just shout down to us "tika-tika-tika-tika". Look, they both have blue ones. Just different shapes. You look disgusting. Have some cheese. Give him some cheese. Are you fucking mental, you old git? Motherfuckers. It hurts, it hurts. This will do. Fuck your mother. Did that really hurt? I didn't mean to hit so hard. Fucking have it. Now this means war. Nationalists. Right, that's it. I'm going to smack you now. Enough. I'm no longer taking part in your debauched orgies. Do you want to be part of all this? No. Do you understand that if you do this, it's a part of my life too? Masha. I didn't shout at you. I asked you to stay in our room. What you're doing is monstrous. I can't stand it. And everyone can see it. It's revolting. What else must I do? Right now, I'm having very strong doubts. I want to respect all your choices. Alright, Masha. I think that now I don't need to say any more. You're right. There's nothing more you could say to me. If I've hurt you, I'm sorry. No. So, specifically, rape is not that important? See, well there's killing and raping. Then there's chasing somebody with water. Alina. These damn balls. Taking me further? Come on then. I know a witch like you, a real witch. I am a witch. You're a witch. I'm going to bite you. Oh yes. Would you agree that socialism is for weak people? That can't compete? She won't fit through there. Why haven't they done more damage? Because they are careful to preserve property. The bread stays in the same place. They haven't even stopped us drinking. You know, it's perfect. Get out of here. Go. You again is it, Blinov? With Alina. For fuck's sake. I had a fuck. He had a fuck. Olya, don't. You'll break it. Don't break it. Give it to me. Olya, you'll break it. You'll drink from metal ones from now on. Give it back. To address our previous question about the creation of a more perfect soldier. This is an experiment into influencing the septal area which is responsible for the reproductive centre. One view of history. Moses was the first to begin. It was that the world goes from a high level, it falls down, but it has to rise up. This notion, it became a basic part of Christianity, but it's true also about Islam. It is a belief about the Redeemer that comes. Now, the funny thing is that the same thing entered in a very different way via Karl Marx. What Karl Marx says about history is exactly the same notion. It's the belief that the world goes down and down. And it must be a revolution that will bring an uplifting. Marxism in that sense is a messianic religion. Test subject, begin. But there's a problem of the perpetual revolution. If the revolution doesn't continue, then the revolution is dead. Can you continue? Are you done? In spite of capitalism's stable development in the twenty-five years since the war, due simply to globalisation and depletion of resources... They won't run out tomorrow, but the effects are evident. It's getting closer. Yes. We can predict with certainty that this economy is choking. Not only because of cyclical instability crises discovered by Marx, but also because of the reasons that didn't exist in Marx's time, which is global resources depletion. This comment only concerned oil, but importantly it can be applied to anything. Any resource? Gas, water for example. Of course. The basic structure is always this. It looks pretty hopeless, doesn't it? Now, let's look at something completely different. Let's examine a situation with infinite resources. In particular, an economy based on knowledge. As I said, the differential equation which describes the situation with finite resoures is like this. The differential equation which describes exponential growth in a situation with infinite resources, is this. Somewhat surprisingly, judging by this the differential equation which describes everything, that is linked to knowledge, won't even be like this, but like this. Speed of growth is proportional to the square of the current value. Curves of this nature... Knowledge is much harder to evaluate than oil. Yes, you can measure oil. Gas, drinking water, any resource. For knowledge, these calculations have been done. They looked at the number of patents. issued in the USA. The USA, as often that kind of work is done there and the statistics there are readily available. Their statistics are never classified over there. It gives a lot of research material. Next, the number of say, scientific articles on a certain topic published worldwide. This is easily measured and already into the tens of thousands, so the statistics start to be very reliable. Scientific articles. Etcetera. Now it gets interesting. The thing is, this equation can be solved, but the solution is somewhat counterintuitive. Its solution is... I'm really not much good at formulae. Something like 'one' over 'a' minus 'bt'. It's called a hyperbole. Importantly, on a graph it will be a curve that goes from zero and tends to infinity. Then, the exponential tends towards infinity, but for a finite length of time. So what we have is a certain specific date when, based on a prediction with our model, the number of scientific articles, or of patents... Comes to a halt? No, it becomes infinite. With such a developement it goes extremely fast. It's even much faster than the exponential. As is usual in physics, if something tends to infinity, then the model stops being applicable. This is what's called a quantum leap. Quantum leap. Something changes that's unpredictable right now. Sometimes it's even called the technological singularity. Or the Omega Point. That terminology was used by Teilhard de Chardin who was a naturalist, philosopher and theologian. He came up with this "infinite future". That's just figurative? Yes, but then people saw that that this abstract point was somewhere... He was a Catholic, he thought that God incarnate would appear. Then people saw that this point in time really exists. The interesting question is: which year? So different estimates give different years. But there are statistics? The statistics are different for each thing that's measured, each give different points, but definitely at the start of the twenty-first century. Here are two versions. That's pretty soon. In the course of two generations this kind of economy will just inevitably knock the old type of economy to the floor. The old economy will no longer be important. We need to change to this regime or we'll lose everything. "It's not for me, the murmuring of the streams" "Their diamond waters rise and swell" "A dark-browed maiden there does dwell" "Oh, how she grows, but not for me" "It's not for me, that Easter comes" "My kin around the table dine" "Their glasses all charged well with wine" "No, such a life is not for me" "Here's what's for me: a lump of lead" "To pierce my skin as white as snow" "And bitter, bitter tears will flow" "Such a life, brother, is for me" "Such a life, brother, is for me" "Such a fate is what's for me" That's my favorite song. Seriously, I once heard a choir sing it. Anyway, I love it. A little wine for you? We don't drink alcohol. None of you? Anyway, let's not talk about bad things. That's social influence for you. A man needs his daily half litre to forget himself. Then he's happy. Half litre of what? Vodka. No, come on. It's the norm for someone who wants to forget themselves. To switch off completely? Yes, people are used to it. Wake up, have a drink, then another with lunch, knock one back before bed and everything's fine. I know no one like that. Don't you? No one who starts drinking in the morning. What a rose-tinted world you live in. We don't usually start drinking in the morning. Nobody starts off by drinking in the morning. You're saying that if we carry on like this... We'll go downhill. If you consume alcohol regularly. It's the first stage of alcoholism, at the very least. It depends on the quantity. For example, I used to drink alcohol and so did he, but this one never did, not even at celebrations. Sie haben nie getrunken? Alcohol might destroy your reproductive cells. It's a lottery. But if you drink regularly and from a young age, the risk is much higher. Families that are fine will procreate and develop. What about ones that aren't fine? They need help. Adopt the kids. If the wife's healthy, but the husband is an alky freak, clearly they'll produce nothing healthy. So help the wife to have a child with a healthy man. And let the alky raise it? How will the alky father treat a normal child? By alky I don't mean a total waste of life, that person will have no parental rights. I mean a man who drinks, but still goes to work and doesn't think himself an alky. But through drink, genetic changes are inevitable. I get that, but what if you pick the wrong person? Since ancient times, women have chosen stronger, more successful male mates. But a lot of them are alcoholics and drug addicts. Alcoholics don't achieve anything. The strongest win. And what they win is the best female mates. The prettiest girl chooses Prince Charming. One day he's a prince, the next he isn't. One day, one thing inspires him, the next... But he's reached his goal of having children, so it doesn't matter if he takes to drink in old age, as the next generation has been formed and the positive genes he might have had, have already been passed down. That's how generational selection works. That has happened for thousands if not millions of years and thanks to that we're all sitting here. Because those negative elements that once weren't selected, stayed somewhere in the margins of evolution. As the revolutionaries said, "start with yourself". If you want to achieve something, do it yourself. Quit drinking and smoking, take up sport, study science or get some experience, surround yourself with positive people, that will be your micro-society and lead us to a higher goal. Creation of a super-human. Let's change the subject. Let's get to know each other. Andrey here works as a coach for the Sports Club. He could tell you about it. Really? That's interesting. I'm a boxer, I used to compete a lot. Now, I coach the youth team. It shows. We're a diverse group. You complement one another. Each of us somehow complements the whole. What we're talking about is linked to our everyday life. Every day, we have to develop somehow. Not just in sport. In every possible way. Read a book, go for a run, do anything, but every day you have to take a step forward. It has to be a victory, no matter how small. If you stand still, that's a step backwards. True. Yes, I agree. Drink to that. Blinov's waking up. What does Maxim do? I want some tea. In a minute. I'm an engineer. But I was somewhat reading the wrong literature, discussing it with the wrong people and was sent to a labour camp. Wow. Yes. But he repented in time. Not quite. I was sent here to study things, I was forbidden to study out there. What's that? Hey, Vika, come here. What are you laughing about? You're like two beached seals. Look at this fucking seal. He's been kissed. Why did you wipe it off? Fuck off. Did you see, Ivan? Don't rub it off. That's take two, Palych. That's more beautiful. Give it here. This is more beautiful. Stop fucking around. Give it here. Are you cold? I'll kill you. Who'll do all the work then? You can all fuck off. Yes, where is it? I've got the hat on. Come on. Let's dance. Dance with Vika. Dance. Palych. Fuck off. Show us, Palych. Your 28 centimeters. You promised. 28 centimeters as promised. I measured it, ten, twenty, twenty-eight. It should be this long. Like a horse's. He's all fucking talk. Show us, here's how long it should be. Why are you stroking my leg? So you'll show us, you're so full of shit. Here you fucking go. Go on then. Need a hand? No. What? It's already fucking withered away. It's all gone. Right. For classical capitalism it's critical that capital has freedom of movement. With artificial obstacles, the system won't work at all and the predictions will be wrong. In the knowledge-based economy it's essential that information can move freely. Because this cumulative effect of many researchers, each amplifying the knowledge of the others, is only achievable if information can move freely. This is sort of counterintuitive, because intuitively it seems that all good discoveries should be classified and not shared with anyone, especially not our enemy. Another way of looking at it is quite the opposite. According to this, we need to share as much as possible, simply because the information will all return to us and all of that together will intensify growth. And we'll reach this groundbreaking development. Information exchange has to be as free as possible, otherwise, this system will never get going. It will slow itself down and make information a limited resource. And we'll end up with this instead of that. Yes. To put it crudely, to develop like this, we'll need to completely abolish our country's secrecy regime. Abolish it? Completely. That's not possible. Yes, that'd be catastrophic now. Simply catastrophic, for a number of reasons. Firstly, we'd lose what we have and need already, not linked with this development. Next, we're not used to functioning in an open regime. Basically, it would be impossible right now. So I think that in our big country with its big economy, we should launch small sectors operating under the new regime. Then later, they will expand and take over everything. Our Institute is a tiny model of this, as we have no secrecy within it. We have an outside wall allowing colleagues inside to talk to each other freely. If we take a tiny bubble in which information moves freely, then, in theory, growth of ideas will be fast. Obviously, our Institute just isn't big enough, in terms of what we cover. How big do you see this centre being? It should grow dynamically. Given where we are in 1968... Let's say, five hundred thousand people will be brought into our new work regime. I think this group should consist of firstly, some Party workers, but just progressive ones in positions of responsibility. Secondly, scientists. And thirdly, perhaps, those we call "the creative intelligentsia". Put this domino here. Fuck off, Ivan. I'm done. Partner, I'm still playing. Here. What else could I fucking do? Four-two. Who lost then? Fuck, I've nothing to take off. Come on, take that off. Are we undressing? Yes. Take your fucking underpants off. Fine, I'll take these off. Are you suggesting I undress Palych? Dima, your go. Dear professors, you are gentlemen. You won't make the girls undress. Sure, now we're already naked. He's one of ours, he can get undressed instead of us. I won't play any more. You can give us hints and undress for us. I gave you hints and you did the opposite. Play fair. You had long johns on. Stop the game. Take them off. We fucking agreed. Palych takes off his underpants. And Alexander takes off his jumper. Palych, take your fucking underpants off. That's not fair, Palych, take off your underpants. I'm doing it, fuck. He promised to take them off. Fine, you fucking prick. Real fucking men. We're ladies, Ira. Fuck off, all of you. Don't turn everyone on. We are all your nearest dearest. No fucking way. I will kiss you to death. I don't need that. I will kiss you all over. Take off your undershirt. The undershirt comes off. Palych? Let's take the tie off. No injuries at work, please. Watch your hands. I've got it. Palych is fucking excited. Will you dance with me after that? You bet he will. Did you hear? He will. You fucking cut me. There, I did it. I want to dance . Let's dance. "Oh, the weary sun..." That's unfair. He's getting dressed. Give that here. What's going on here? Hello. We're celebrating. We decided to relax at the end of the working day. So we're playing strip dominoes. They stripped me. You all played strip dominoes. I'm starting to understand. The party is over. Put that decanter back behind the bar. Outside, Palych. Go on. Come on, out you go. Leave it, come on. This way. The Director will give you a ride in his car. Palych, your naked arse. We have the right to breathe, to think, to play, relax. They don't give a fuck. It's all about controlling us. Don't we do our fucking jobs properly? Like the fuck we need it. I was with the deputy director of the Institute. In a team. Yes, in a team. You should mention that, it's an important point. The facilities manager too. What's his surname? Facilities manager. There's only one anyway. You're head of personnel and you don't know? His name is Dmitry Fokin. And the cook's surname is... Protorenko. You should write it down: Protorenko. What part did the waitresses play in it? They just watched. They just watched. Why were they undressed then? What do you mean? Well, they were undressed. If they lost as well... They were in their underwear. So they were playing? Yes. Who are the waitresses? They're Vika and... And? Oh, flipping heck. Ira. And surnames? I forgot. You can't remember a thing. You've drunk your brain soft. Why? I don't know why. You can't remember the facilities manager's name. Well, whose idea was it? Who proposed it? Ivan. He cajoled you all into it? Yes, and we went along with it. Did you put it to a vote? No, we didn't. It was unanimous. I have a statement here from one of the participants. He writes, that your drunk orgy was your initiative. You can probably check that... Yes, I can. I take the blame on myself. I wrote that there. Have you your Party card on you? No, it's at home. At home? It would be a good idea to hand it in. So that it doesn't stretch your pocket. I know a lot about you, Palych. Maybe more than you know. How are you feeling? Alright. Cat got your tongue? Fancy some cognac? No, thanks, I don't want any. So you don't fall off your chair. You sure? I'll pour you a glass. No, thanks. No? Why shouldn't the cat get my tongue? I'm in the director's office after all. Look, Palych, here's the situation. Perhaps the time has come to draw a line. You're getting old, your memory's failing you A line it is then. Wait. Where are you going? Wait. I haven't finished yet. A line. Sit a bit closer. Have you finished the statement? I have. Now listen carefully to me. You have two options. Either leave with honour intact and we'll hush up this dirt so you don't have to deal with it. We can let people think that the Institute's management doesn't know about it. The other option is to leave in disgrace. I think, as you're a clever person, you will, of course, choose the first option, right? Please step out over there, Palych. I should have done this in public, but after what happened, that would look like a circus. "The Union of Soviet Social Republics..." Wait. "Medal for Labour Valour, Anatoly Palych Sidko" This is a travel voucher for you to go to Crimea. You can have a rest, recuperate. Visit the glorious city of Sevastopol. This is for your retirement. You will become a master fisherman. You'll go fishing. There'll be more presents to come. We'll always be happy to see you here, Palych. Come see us. If you have any requests come to us. We'll always be happy to see you here. Thank you again. Good luck with the fishing. Thank you. Bye, Palych. How do you get out of here? It's a labyrinth. I don't know how to get out. You could get lost forever in here. How do you get out? Are they in trouble? I don't know yet. We'll find out now. Comrades, I am deeply ashamed to stand here in front of you. Our Institute would never have reached, the forefront of world science, if all of its employees had not kept strictly to its communist morals. Hard as it may be, I have to confess, canteen employees were drinking alcohol, while playing strip dominoes. Discovering this situation, not only did I not stop it, but I actively joined in. For over 25 years now, I have been responsible for overseeing economic and scientific planning in the Institute. My irresponsible behaviour displayed deep ingratitude to the Party, the government, and to my own Institute, which all entrusted me with this honorable post. My behaviour undermines the work of the Institute from within. I must confess that my health prevents me from working with my previous dedication. My vigilance has weakened. Please take this into consideration and allow me to retire, which I dare to hope I still deserve, despite everything. I am asking not for my own benefit, but for the benefit of the Institute's staff and that of Soviet science. Thank you, comrades. Thank you. Take a seat. Comrade Belova. You're not in my office, face them, please. I'm very ashamed, comrades to end up in such an unpleasant situation. Don't look at us. Speak to the people. And that our director saw me in such an unworthy light. If I hadn't seen you, would it have been alright? Well... You know... Our team's been working together for a long time. We are like one family. Look at your family then. Are you suggesting that everyone should undress? No, we've never done that before. We'd all had a bit to drink. I think it was more than a bit. It only seemed a bit to me. Alright, sit down. Thank you. As we'll get nothing more out of you. Comrade Skitskaya. Face your comrades, please. Good evening. Dear comrades. I am a Soviet woman. A future wife and mother, but today all of my energy is devoted to work. Only this can explain my unworthy behaviour. Of course, it is not compatible with... Excuse me. With the moral image of a Soviet person, a builder of communism. I fully understand that, with the tasks facing our Institute, its employees must have the highest moral standards. I understand that I have no justification, but I ask you to take what I've said into consideration and I hope I can ask my comrades to vouch for me. Whose idea was it to play strip dominoes? It was my idea. It was Ivan's idea? - Yes, the cook. It was my idea. Take a seat, Comrade Skitskaya. Thank you. No need to thank me. Comrade Protorenko, let's hear from you now. I would like to apologise to everyone here. First of all, I really am very ashamed. I must say that I was the instigator of it all. That's what happened. It was in the early hours of the morning. And we decided to relax. It was my suggestion. I said to Fokin and the girls, "Let's have a drink". "Let's hang out, relax and play a game" And so we did. How does this drinking, and playing so lustily and heartily, conform to moral code of the builders of communism? It doesn't. I am in trouble at home for that. My wife and I have problems. I understand that, I'm not a young man. No good has come of it. Take a seat. I'll now sum up the meeting. We will satisfy Alexander's request. He will take his well-deserved retirement. The other participants, in accordance with employment law will face a disciplinary action. And on another point related to this incident, which we will now address separately. Comrade Anatoly Palych Sidko, a respected member of staff, but also involved in the incident. He somewhat pre-empted this meeting. He submitted his resignation, which has been accepted. Anatoly Palych, please come out here. Turn around, let everybody look at you. Anatoly Palych has been given a state award. And here if a gift, a radio. This is from the staff. You are always welcome here. Come visit and share your advice. Will you say a few words? Yes, I want to thank the Institute's management, the Party organization and the trade union, for appreciating the work I have invested in the Institute. I have been working for a long time, and evidently I am tired. It's true. We did have a drink and a bite to eat with the youngsters. Something like that. Thank you for the gift. I will fondly remember the Institute and will pop in. Anyway. There are so many young people here. Perhaps I can give some advice. I have a great deal of experience. Thank you for listening. Girls, girls. Hey, you girls. At last, real autumn. It looks amazing, like a real carpet. Let's put it inside, so they look for a Cinderella. Denis would be like, "I found a shoe". "Who will it fit?" Admit it, this is much more fun. Yes. You should've seen how pretty it was from the balcony. Throw them all over me. Not like that, from above. More. How do we see? How do we see now the world in reality? If we are speaking about science of our time, the real world becomes slightly questionable. The physical world is really nothing like what we see, what we feel and we can touch. If I said the real world is something that I don't see and I cannot see, I want to feel it but I cannot feel it. This point about what is, what exists, what is true, becomes much, much more shaky, see? When I speak about science of our time, the real world is basically a huge emptiness. Three bees in Europe. That is the amount of material in an atom. Three bees moving in Europe. If I begin with that, anything that I can think as my very basic notions of existence, of me, of self, of anything else... I have somehow to deny them. What's your scar from? It was just from a street fight. One scumbag had a knife. And I didn't see it and hit it with my hand. Same here. Same fight? Yes. If you hit a knife, you're left with something like this. Your fingers bend like this. Because there's a flexor muscle, but the extensor muscle's been cut. Same with this finger. They stitched it back together. But it only bends this far. Maybe it's a good thing I didn't see the knife. As soon as you defend yourself, you lose. You need to attack. Bang, bang in their fuckface. I cut you. Nothing major. Nothing fatal. Still, not nice. Holding your knife like this, that's just nonsense. It's a great position to finish them off. I mean in a fight, when your opponent's here. It's awkward to stab here. Much easier to stab his neck from here. In their piggy neck. When there's two of them and you hold it like this. The range is too short. I can't stab you and I can't cut you. I got you in the chest. Right in the tit. Don't distract me. If I were thirty years younger, I would hop about with them too. One, two. Same technique as when you're head on. But because it's from the side, not straight, there's a bit of an angle. So it's good if you work in a sequence. One, two and then the hook comes here. After a few hits, depending on his experience, he'll start to close up. But this space will remain open, so you can go ahead and hit straight in there. And turn your feet too. One, two. Can I box a bit with you? Yes. Do you mind? Of course not. May I have the gloves? I just want to take a trip down memory lane. What if I do this? Go on. Then I'll finish with a hook. Left, right. Yes, go on. Good day. Hello. Hallo. Good day. Over the past few years, the Institute has aimed to research the development of superhuman abilities. You could call it developing a "superhuman". Obviously, there can be no communism, if it includes alcoholics, parasites, thieves, people who are greedy and deceitful, and so on. If we don't develop this new human, we won't achieve a communist society. You have come here as a group not to be test subjects, but rather to keep an eye on people and come to a conclusion on how to achieve these aims I've mentioned sooner. I'd like to find out a little more about you, about your moral principles, which you take as your basis, your starting point, which you would never renounce, if they are true principles. What do you say? I see what you're saying. I'm a doctor by training. So through my studies of human anatomy, physiology and sociology, I've reached the conclusion that not all of us can go to the bright future, in which only normal people should live. Medical methods have to be used on some people to isolate them from society, to prevent them reproducing. Normal people should be brought up within classical, traditional values. That is patriotism, love for your family and those around you. If anyone finds family and sober thought unacceptable, then they should stay outside our society. Firstly, their reproductive rights should be limited and perhaps they should be isolated from society. Either camps or labour should be devised for them. Something like that. I see what you're saying. We'll talk about the rudimentary elements of society in a bit. And you are? Andrey. My father brought me up in a spirit of healthy patriotism. I guess I have a very developed sense of brotherhood, and over the course of my life I've come into contact with a lot of people who don't share my views. And I started to wonder, why would people live in a society, without trying to improve it? I realised that not all people deserve to live in society. Alcoholics, murderers, maniacs, perverts. I realised we need to get rid of these people. That's the theory, but have you ever applied this in practice? Have you ever punished those people? I've definitely punished people. We've all seen injustice. It's every normal citizen's task to react against injustice. To play the judge and to pass sentence on someone? Yes, if I see a crime, I won't pass by. If someone drinks vodka in a playground, they should be punished there and then. Have you ever had to kill anyone? No, I've never had to kill anyone. Could you, if you had to? Yes. If the circumstances demanded, I would do it. If someone wanted to kill me, I'd do it in self-defence. If the Motherland told me, that the person was an enemy of our state, then I would do it. Let's go away together, I don't know where. What about to D1? Listen, why don't we... Well, why not, really? Why don't we just get married? You did propose to me after all. Or was it just empty words? Listen, really, I look after you well, don't I? I milk the cow and bring you milk. Alright, fine. Let's be friends. Let's try to lie on the bed together. Really? Yes. Lie down, if there's enough room for you. What are we going to do next? We'll lie here as if we're husband and wife. I don't know. If you want to, just do it. What? Kiss you? Magical. I like the way you pout. You're not so bitter after all. I don't know how all this is will end. I think it's so nice the way we're just lying here. What else? What else do we need to be happy? You can breed new types of dogs. You drown the defective pups. You crossbreed the best ones, and as a result, you get what the breeder wants. It's harder with people. There's ethics. When a freak is born, you have to keep him. But keep him where? With the parents? Then he grows up and wants to have children. He reproduces and so on. Naturally, this all leads to the degeneration of society. I think we first need to change our ethics and then the tools for selecting the best people. I'd like to understand what mechanisms we need in society... Sorry, have you ever had to use violence which, in certain circumstances, could have led to death? Yes, of course. You've beat people up? Yes. With objects? Yes. Sharp objects? Sharp objects, heavy objects, various objects. I see. During and before the war, I myself also had to. I had to kill people. That's how it worked out, it was necessary. I do realise that, at times, it could have been a mistake. I could have sometimes killed the wrong person. But then again, the idea was that it was necessary. My conscience was clear. Maxim, your namesake here mentioned labour camps as a method of isolating this human trash. I worked in close contact with prisons for some years. Prisons are like mirrors, they reflect all human defects, even more vividly. And the Institute is also a model of society. It is also a prison of sorts, a golden cage. It's a model of society with all the human defects. I asked about this on purpose, and I expected such answers. This society is deteriorating. The same is happening in the Institute. Alcoholism, sexual depravity, lack of belief in a future, squabbles, gossiping and so on and so forth. That's what's going on. In light of this, and within the limits of the experiment, of which you are all participants, your task is to attempt to influence the people around you. I will try to instruct you on how you need to do that. By no means should there be any direct aggression. Violence, rudeness or arrogance are out of the question. But you have to somehow create for those people surrounding you, a state of constant nervous tension. Make them feel sick, make them feel on edge. If you show any direct aggression, they'll come to me with their complaints. If there are specific accusations against you, I would have to address them. But if they just complain they don't like being around you, then I won't examine them as they'd be unsubstantial. I might dislike some people here too. Anyway, you get the idea. The director made quite a strong impression on us. We're just discussing that. He's entrusted us with certain commitments and a certain amount of responsibility. It's responsibility not only to the workers here, but also to the whole country. Do you need to make a decision? No, it's been made. Why discuss it then? We need to share our impressions. Like when you buy a new dress. Once you've bought it, you still discuss it. All emotions are interesting. We're not robots, after all. You have a talented son. Yes. Does he do any sport? He's thinking about it. That's a start. Do you play the piano? You're not thinking about taking up the piano? It's never even crossed my mind. I play guitar. You play guitar? He does too, and he sings. Wonderful. Zhenya gives us art in its most natural form. He doesn't go in for any of that abstract stuff. What should art bring? It should bring light. Abstract art doesn't bring light? No. It brings murk. Murk? If many people say it's murky drivel, it probably is. And if fewer people say it's not drivel, then the majority's right? Depends who the minority is. Are they competent people? If there's some clever formula, people will say it's drivel. So competence is important in art? No, something else is important, because competent people might have vested interests. What's important here is feeling. You're right. But for the masses, not just for two people, who sell a wonky painting, saying "We see the world like this" Then that is exactly what I call drivel. I'll play you some excerpts from the opera I'm composing. Just a little bit. It's rather chaotic and abstract. It's abstractionism. "Abstract" in the sense that you said earlier? Earlier when? At the table. Fuck, his music is just as wanky as he is. An extravagant young man. Wasn't that just the wankiest music? And all that Jewish drivel. Abstract art and all that wonky stuff. It's probably absolute proof. Yes. Do you believe a man has a soul? Yes or no? Neither yes or no. Do Orthodox Christians? They should do. Yes, they should. Do you know what the nasty habit of smoking does to people in jail? When I was inside, I bought three souls and I actually received receipts for them. "I, such-and-such, give my immortal Orthodox soul," "in eternal possession to the bearer of this document." How? I had some cigarettes sent to me. It's a form of payment inside. For me, they're a product. You'd pay someone to wash the floor. So I had a thought. I told one of the scroungers, "Write me a receipt for your soul" "and I'll give you a pack of cigarettes." "No way. The whole pack?" "Yes." It irritated me that he'd pray before bed. Stupid animal, praying then washing socks for cigs. I said, "Write me a receipt for your soul" "and I'll give you a pack." "Really?" "You're not lying?" "Here's your pack, now write." He wrote what I dictated and also got some artificial sweetner. It was his soul after all, so I gave him that. He asked if I needed more souls. "Go on." Three minutes later, another comes in with his soul. I said, "here's the template, copy it out". A third comes in, just the same. Twenty cubes of artificial sweetener for an immortal, Orthodox soul. Bought, down on paper. I don't believe in this, it's just funny. They're all pious, praying, wearing their crosses, but they're prepared to sell their soul for cigarettes. That's what harmful habits lead to, a total lack of will. What if you suggested they spit on the cross? Spitting on the cross would have cost one cigarette. Seriously? They'd have anal sex for just one cigarette. Any bad habit can turn you into a weak man. You have no will, even from a simple habit like smoking. It turns you into a slave, prepared to do anything. Turn over before it drips down. It'll drip onto your bed. My fingers are numb. That's because of all the drinking. There's water everywhere. Half the bathroom is wet. Who has to mop it up? Me, I expect. Or the person who did it. It'll dry by the morning. There'll be a scandal in the morning. Who'll scream? Olga. Is she a prison bitch? Stop it with your prison slang. You said you are a normal person. I used to annoy inmates using smart words. Here I annoy smart people using inmates' words. It's awful. Why do you do that? I don't know. It's fun, I do it automatically. Comrade Azhippo, I have always thought that Dau would get better, but his condition hasn't changed for eight years now. Yes, his physical capabilities are improving a little, but I feel that the results the Institute expects from him are non-existent, to put it bluntly. That's well known. Lately it's getting difficult for him to attend meetings. I realise that the younger generation's time has come. It's not right for us to keep living in the Institute, considering the complicated situation and Dau's poor health. Comrade Azhippo, I would like to ask you to help us, if it's at all possible, to get us a flat in Moscow. I see. Away from the Institute. After all, Dau... Nora, your husband receives a salary, he gets royalties for published work, he gets bonuses. You're a quite well-off family, you have money. What's stopping you from buying a cooperative flat? Either putting your name down, or buying one now. I don't see what's stopping you. I understand your problem, we all feel for you. But what more do you want? It's just not possible. I don't see how it could be, that we could change your living situation. Any more questions? Not right now. Thank you, Comrade Azhippo. Thank you for your understanding. Goodbye. Goodbye. Next, please. Blinov. Should we do a cardiogram right after the encephalogram? Yes, right after. Better before to have them side by side. Bring the previous test subject straight over. Alright. Thank you. Andrew, Olga will take care of showing you the place. Hello. Hello, comrades. This is Andrew Ondrejack. He teaches psychology at Rockefeller University in New York. He's worked with Professor Abramovich whom many of you know. She conducted an experiment at the Institute. He's here for four days, to participate in the experiments in the field of psychology. Some vodka? Please be seated here. I don't know, but I frankly don't give a... May I have this cup, please? Are you hungry? Sure, I'll have a bite. Can you translate a question for the professor? Black people in the USA are involved in petty crime, they're parasites on the economy and the white population. African Americans, actually. The things they do in the United States like... They are the parasites. They're social parasites. ...economical parasites. The question is: What do you think? What's the cause? Are black people forced to fulfill the social expectations that are put on them? Is it a social expectation so it's expected from them? Which pushes them to behave like that or something else? I can't say, I'm not an African American. He can't say, because he himself is not black. Aren't you afraid that perhaps the biased relationship with the black population means they'll be given certain rights and privileges, simply because they're black? Aren't you afraid that they will be given special privileges? More than whites have? Special privileges beyond the right to vote? Beyond what whites have, some kind of special treatment? I mean, I don't know. I don't look at sociology with that in mind. He says, he doesn't know. It's not a worry of mine. It doesn't worry him, but sociology is not his field. Fine, but just from an ordinary person's point of view. But just from like the ordinary point of view? What's his personal opinion as a citizen of the USA? Your personal opinion about this like a citizen? Like a citizen of the United States, what you personally think? No, that was just an introduction. Is the psychology of black people more primitive than whites? Is the psychology of blacks more primitive than that of whites? Is it what, sorry? Psychologically. Are blacks more primitive than whites? I don't know, I don't study their behaviour in that way. Do you want me to say yes or no? You're afraid we... What's "decide"? We'll think... you're racist? You're afraid they will think that you're a racist? Oh, no, I don't care what you think. He doesn't really care. And what do you think about Jews? I don't bother the Jews, and the Jews don't bother me. He doesn't come into contact with any Jews. He doesn't bother Jews, and they don't bother him. In America there's no one the Jews don't affect. Jews print your money. The bottom line is that you can't say Jews don't bother you. Jews bother anyone, because they print your money. Good story, isn't it? Yes, educational. It's very strange that Jews don't bother you and you don't see any Negros, how do you live? Perhaps my circumstances are affected by it, but I don't take an active part in it I don't participate in it. It's not something that interests me as much, It's not what I focus on in my life's work. He says it might affect his life, but it's not a part of his life he can actively influence. He doesn't play a part in it, so it's not his business. He's a saint. They obviously have a subject they're passionate about and they want me to be passionate about it. No, they just want to understand. Sorry? They say that you are a saint. I'm a saint? Saint man. He doesn't give a cunt about anything. You don't care about anything. That's tricky to translate. You can't translate that in one word. What actually is your field of interest? I work with people with disabilities. He works with people with disabilities. With the retarded? Very good. Don't spin me. Why not? Can I ask somebody to bring four things to put on the edges? Yes, we have already asked. Great. Like right here, or it can be that distance? They come stand here from point B, and then they come in and do the tearing. The American is clearly a faggot. You can tell he's a faggot. He's making eyes at you more than at the girls. Why don't you tell everyone he hit on you in the toilet? Why don't you, and say you kissed him? It's a fact, you can see he's a faggot. No, you can't. You can tell he's a dumb fuck. Come on. He's just a usual piece of shit. What do you mean? If a man has such delicate faggot hands, then he's a faggot. Stand here, please. No, no, over here. Hello. My name is Andrew Ondrejack. I'm a psychologist. And I focus on experimental behavioural psychology. So we're gonna do an experiment that's quite a simple task, and it will happen in three parts. The first part is just standing. You'll stand in place for ten minutes. The second part is a task that you'll do for fifteen minutes. The task you'll be given is to tear a piece of paper in one continuous tear. It's quite simple. You see the paper behind you is the one you'll be tearing. After 15 minutes you'll go back to your standing position and will stand for ten minutes. And then it's over. That's all. Shall I start? It's quite simple, no? Do you have any questions? No? Okay. Every day as a day is unique. You don't have the same day, by very definition, twice. So this day has special things that the day expects you to do. What was done in this day? Sometimes the answer is: Nothing. And if the answer is nothing, it's a big crime. You see? And if you have a day and you killed it, you get punished. I can give him a comment to increase the tearing. No, just let him finish. Maybe he'll change direction or something. But he's doing this task very carefully. It's kind of beautiful to watch. I think it's too cold to be standing down there. He always looks in our direction. He's waiting to finish. He must be in agony. Every person is entitled at least to one day of craziness in his life. For no known reason. I am sure that when a person goes all the time in a straight line, you get sometimes the wrong direction. So you have sometimes to make a move. And when you make a move, it results in all kinds of events. It may be painful. It may also be a release. It's a release from some kind of a straight existence. I'll erase this and draw a table. The one from last time? Yes, go ahead. This is the start of the process. Let's write 1985. Yes, a round number. The liberation of information. Yes. I want to emphasise, this is nothing to do with political slogans like "Freedom of Speech", "Freedom of the Press". I don't want to go anywhere near political slogans. This is purely pragmatic. It doesn't mean anyone can say what they like, but for information to drive this new economy, it has to be able to move freely. What individual people want isn't that important. Technical, scientific information? We'd start with technical and scientific information, but as the growth is very quick, we can't create an effective limiting mechanism, as it would slow it all down. We have to be ready for any kind of information. It's perhaps even inevitable. As for the people who this goes through, there may be people who want to use it to evil ends, for destructive purposes. We need to neutralise them or they could be a problem. Don't you think there'll be huge opposition to this? People who are opposed to free information? I suppose there will be. Considering our traditions, our habits. I am leading to that eventually. Following the graph. After five years of rapid development, there might even be a formal political dissolution of our country. This will create competition between the regions. About ten years later, the reverse process begins. A unification. On the next level. We'd hope to reunify more than we had split apart. We could include some European countries. Many European countries stand between capitalism and socialism and might be on our side by then. Then ten years later, there'll be a quantum leap. Which is sometimes called the technological singularity. Or the Omega Point. Let's call it the Omega Point. There are certain layers of population, people who'll lead the process. They'll be scientists, engineers and administrators and due to our history, there'll be the security services. The KGB, the GRU and the military. But here's the problem that you mentioned. The intelligence services protect information. It's an important task of theirs. Yes. This is the paradox of any secret organisation. Above all else, secret organisations limit information about themselves to the outside. Not just security services, secret societies do the same. But if you limit the flow of information in one direction, you inevitably limit it in the other direction too. If the world doesn't know anything about you, then you can know very little about the world. It's a two-way process. Yes, always. It's like in Wells' novel "The Invisible Man". Anyone who's studied basic physics knows that the perfect invisible man wouldn't be able to see. Light would pass through him and never hit his eyes. This paradox applies to all secret organisation. So the perfect secret organisation is completely stupid and produces nothing but chaos. We can't have that under this regime. So I think that within the security service a stratification will occur. This concerns me terribly. This will occur among its workers, as people. Many of its workers will oppose to all of this. That's how they are, they see it as their duty... To oppose to things. Yes, and this in particular. As they're honest people, we won't change their minds, They'll protect what they were ordered to do. Objectively speaking, they become enemies. How many people do you examine? There's three. We're gonna shorten the time because it's so cold. Yes. Too cold to stand for ten minutes. But it's really beautiful to watch him do this. I mean it's, like, such precise destruction. Yes, so precise. Yeah. The point is that they're to tear the paper. Along the edges? No, it doesn't matter how. As long as it's done within the exact time. Test subject, finish your task. Return to your initial position. Go to position B. Sorry, I don't want to take up any more time, but do you have any final questions for me about this? What is the general idea of this experiment? What I tend to usually do is set very simple tasks for people to do, very able bodied intellectual people to do something very simple and just sort of compare the way people respond to a task. He compares the ways people perform this task. It is just a way to sort of isolate an observation. It's a way of observing. And what conclusions have you drawn? I don't have any conclusions, just observations at the moment. But for now it just gives me a sense of sort of how people understand the instructions. Any questions? No. Okay. Alright, thanks a lot, I appreciate it. Shall we go to do what I was saying? He suggests to go to the pigs. He has some research. The what? He has some research about the pigs. About the pigs? Are there really pigs here? Yes. There are? Yes. Where are they? Straight ahead and to the left. Downstairs. I'll grab his neck and you take his legs. Is that really the smell of the pigs? Yes. Behind this door. I don't want to see the pigs. I'm not interested in pigs, I'm just interested in human behavior. No, we want to see his behaviour not the pigs'. They wanted to check human behavior with pigs. Okay, it's not my interest, but thank you. He's not interested. Thank you, guys. He saw through us. Scumbag. Andrew, sorry, I have to go. Yeah. What? We should've got him alone. Get him in the corridor. He'll scream. Make sure he can't kick his legs when we grab him. Let's talk her into it. Fancy doing something fun? Ask the American to go out into the corridor with you. Pretend you want a word. Why? Ask him into the corridor. What for? It will be fun. You wanted to have some fun. I hope he's not offended, I've done that myself. He hopes you're not offended. No, no. No, we need to discuss. No, to discuss. We've thought up an experiment. We wanted him to come with us. It's an experiment not far from here. They invited experiment. Invented an experiment. I don't want to do any more experiments, I just want to get a drink and relax. He just wants to relax. It's still early. Maybe later, we can do it later really. One experiment. One more experiment. No. And then a drink. We'll get you a bottle of vodka and some food. They're gonna get a bottle of vodka. And we'll conk out under the table. I just don't want to. I'm just gonna get a coffee and sit for a minute. Can you say, "Andrew, I want to kiss you". "'Can you step out with me?" No, I'm at work. I'm not getting involved. Hello, canteen. It's because things are about to get out of control. And no one's in control, that's the problem. I'll get the neck, you go legs. Let's see his reaction. We'll have to think up something different next. He's leaving today. Is he? Where did you lot fuck off to? It's full of fags in there. Maybe the point is that your methods aren't working? What methods? All these stupid fucking jokes. Putting condoms on vodka. What's our fucking off got to do with that? You're always doing something then leaving. Like when you broke the radio. It's for us and not for you. And then you got scared and hid. Or you say, "I'll go sleep in the pigsty". But what do you do? A big fat sow. We're friends. Well, I'm friends with you. Let me shake you about. Why do this? Don't lose your cool. Calm down. Hold her arms. You know, when a girl is in a situation like this, drinking alcohol to excess, she starts to get excessively aggressive, starts to get wound up. I don't even fancy groping your privates. Fuck, you can't do anything yourself. Always have to ask your friends for help. Why you behaving like this? That's my business. It's not your business. Let's throw her to the pigs. Let's carry her. Too troublesome. We'll fall over, let's fucking leave her be. Go on, try it. She attacked us. Yes, but she's a girl. It's three against one. I don't want any trouble here. Stop it, alright? Let her go then. As soon as someone comes, you lose your nerve. Can't do anything, can you? What do you think we were going to do? Ksenia, calm down, rise above it. You're behaving like them. I'm being a pig to pigs. Andrey, hold her. Come here. Why don't you tell me how you want us to... We're having a private conversation. How do you want us to behave in your presence. I want you to behave decently and with respect. And were you behaving decently just now? Perhaps not. What do you want from us then? I want you to react to it somehow. We do react. You just laugh at your jokes. Yes, we do. What are you trying to do? Probably. Locked. Fuck. Somewhere was open. I can't see him. Unlikely. He was just here. The foreign tourist is going to fucking get away. I think the unification that's described here. It will happen naturally. The organisation, that will control it all, will be KGB. It will have a different name by then and probably without a formal structure. In the best case scenario, around this time. Those people who want new things, people who are aiming for the future, for communism, people who are aiming for the future, for communism, aiming for the Omega Point, they will prevail within the KGB and we really could end up with this regime. Then what happens? If the regime works well, by around 2020, it becomes completely unpredictable, in a good way. We'd reach new heights we can't even imagine now. There's also a worse, but more realistic scenario. By this point, the KGB hasn't sorted out it's internal problems or it's been taken over by those KGB people, who's aim is to preserve and protect. We'd have to find a way of neutralising them. We'd need some kind of mechanism which will allow us to overcome this final hurdle. A mechanism within the KGB organisation itself. Yes. I never thought such a mechanism could exist, but I've had some ideas from talking to our test subjects. They're amusing guys. I do doubt whether it's safe to have them living here as equals. Shouldn't we increase security? Perhaps. They can be very unpredictable and threatening. Are their reactions unnacceptable? They're fine for now. They really could blow up at any moment. It's not that important. We can discuss it later. More interesting is how their heads work. They're not stupid, but they're caught up in one idea. They either completely filter out new ideas put to them or adapt them into their overarching idea. Everything goes down some kind of funnel. This overarching idea is nationalism. It's a whole religion for them. They call it 'race' or 'nation', but it's a whole set of values. Their main aim is to protect this. They're fixated on the past. And as they're not stupid, they don't position themselves in opposition to the authorities. In certain circumstances they could oppose the authorities, but that's by no means their aim. They're now clearly monitored by the security services, but that's always a two-way process. Like with the Tsar's Secret Police and the Socialist Revolutionaries. They fought for their rights through bombings and terrorism. There were expropriations and hard labour sentences. Yes, lots of provocations, and all of that. In the end, these groups merged. Now there's no trace of either, as the Tsar's Secret Police was destroyed in the revolution and the Socialist Revolutionaries wore themselves out and became incapable of structured action. Of course, the final blow came in the civil war. But even by 1917, when they had a majority in the Assembly, they were no longer a structured force. The Bolsehviks didn't even destroy them, just brushed them aside. I think that such a mechanism could be included here. Even now, a sort of Russian chauvinism has taken root. I think that it should be intensified. It'll be intensified whatever the case. We need to take over control of it. Yes, but eventually, those who control these people, will merge with them and they'll destroy each other. So in a bad scenario, but not the worst case, I'd expect sharp a intensification of nationalism in these years. Nationalism would become the central idea of the state, but not in a good sense, Just pride for pride's sake. "We're proud because we're proud, because we're the best." It's a purely destructive idea, and doesn't lead to any movement to the future, it's a conservative idea, but it's also quite radical, as these people would kill for it. So if there is a sharp rise in patriotism, I hope it will all eventually explode. We'll possibly go through a certain amount of unrest somewhere between 2010 and 2020. There might even be something like 1917. It might even look like a revolution. The nationalists will somehow take power, then shortly they'll prove to be nobodies, without any manifesto. They won't be deposed, they'll just dissolve and disappear, back to where they came from. Stop. Help, help me. He's breaking free. Let Blinov go, you bastards. What are you doing? Are you animals? You think it's funny, to treat people like that? Is it fucking funny? Let me go, right now. You heartless bastard. You unfeeling lump. I'm out of breath. Idiot. Why? Because. You think it's normal to offend people? Who's offending people? You just offended him. Do you realise he really was scared? You lot and your idiotic jokes. Are you done? No, I'm not done. Max played a little joke. Your jokes aren't funny. What's wrong? You'll never see him again. He will fly back to America. He would've written about these idiots in the USSR, but now he'll write that people tried to kill him for being a faggot. You think that's normal? Of course, he's a faggot. That doesn't stop him being a good man. It really does. It doesn't, he's wonderful. He really is a fantastic person. Because you're a girl and he doesn't want to fuck you. How can I even turn my back on him? Has he ever laid a finger on you? Yes, he has. And? Did he fuck you or what? I shook his hand and felt he was a fag. Did he do something with his hand? Shook yours? It insulted my inner masculine convictions. And I thought: What if fear cures homosexuality? Do you know how euphoric it is to think you're going to die, and then to escape with your life? He'll be feeling on top of the fucking world now. He was scared of being hunted, but he made it out in one piece and nobody's going to do anything to him. Imagine how good he feels now. Better than if all of you sucked him off together. Ten, a hundred times better. I hit him really fucking hard. What did you do? The professor grabbed me, so I fucking chucked him down. I turned that on to fry some sausage. Use the other one. Why fucking provoke me? I'm not. Thanks for lighting the gas stove for me. You're welcome. This will all be taken into account. Can I give you some advice? No. I will tell you anyway. Don't fry sausage in oil, it's oily enough. Pass the chopping board. Maxim, when we sit here of an evening, all conversations lead to the same handful of topics. On the first day, it was kind of interesting. The second day, it was alright. Now it's become boring. Why don't you widen your horizons, as you are living here? We could talk about violence, for example? The violence you tried to inflict today. We always talk about that. That's interesting. About violence, about racial discrimination. No, don't change the subject. What racial discrimination? Explain why you attacked us in a drunken state earlier on. You got drunk. You provoked the violence yourself. You tried to hit me in the face. You know that I could hit you hard enough to break your jaw and knock you out. Why did you do it? Explain yourself. Not enough action in your life? First of all... The record's stuck. Blinov. Remember we spoke about esoteric experience? Go to bed. Getting fucking smacked in the face is an esoteric experience? Getting smacked in the face is always a good thing. Just look at me. I hope you didn't get hit too hard earlier. No, everything was fine. When we were after the tourist. The boys have made an announcement. They're no longer going to fight against our alcoholism. Why ever not? Morally, you're dead and buried to us. Soon we'll be properly dead and buried too. Exactly my point. No one needs us anymore. We're just old farts who are waiting to die. I probably won't even live to see tomorrow. Or the day after tomorrow, frig knows. What can we do? You know, life is... Depends on how you behave. Life is a pretty dangerous thing. Come here. Blinov, I don't think you fully recovered yet. And didn't feel the full baseness of your deed. Here we go. I had vodka poured on me. Grab her. Stop it. Everything's fine. Nothing's fine. Everything's fine. No, no. Everything's fine. Please, don't do this. Don't touch me. Don't touch the girls. Have you lost your mind? What are you doing? Put the girl down. I've got her. Let the girl go. Open the door. I told you to let her go. Let's take her to the pigsty. No, calm down. What the fuck? You brute. Get going. What's with all this violence? I told her. Let the girl go. You won't get through. Don't touch me. Don't touch Alina. Have some respect. Don't touch Alina. How do you switch this frigging thing on? Fuck, Andrey, you've been told to drag her out. They've locked us in here. That was really unacceptable behaviour. Maxim. What do you want? Are you a man or not? How can you raise your hand to a girl? Did I beat her? You touched Ksenia. Did I beat her? We haven't touched anyone yet. Know what happens when we touch someone? You can't even imagine. What can you even do, you fucking bitch? How can you touch a girl? She still has to be responsible for her actions. A man should protect a girl. Only when a girl asks him to do so. When she's aggressive she stops being a girl. She becomes an object to be neutralized. Give me my fucking glasses. What do you think? That we've come here to play with you? Do you have any fucking idea who we are? Any idea at all? Let's relax a bit now. Switch that off. Switch it off. No, don't, please. I'll pull the plug. Why, again? I'll tell you once more. There'll be no more fucking backchat to us. Otherwise you'll be all fucked. The first to fucking pipe up is getting taken to the pigsty. Just fucking break it. Stop, why are you doing this? We'll take you to the pigsty and you'll stay there till morning. Stop. The first to backchat us. Is that clear? No. Is that clear or not? We tried to behave and to see eye to eye with you. But this is fucked. It's just rude. Why are you behaving like this? This is who we are. This is our house. Is that clear? You have no right. We do have the right. Not at all. No one gives you the right, you have to take it. Don't breathe on me, your breath stinks. Is it clear? You have no right. We've been civilised. No. We're not going to lecture you. We're not going to put salt and sugar in your booze. Get pissed, destroy yourselves, do what you want. But at the smallest backchat, we'll fucking tie you up and take you to the pigs, man or woman. Is that clear? You'll pay for this, it's illegal. Don't you understand that? No one gave you the right. Yes, they did. Who gave you the right to abuse our professors? What can they do? Just you try your dirty tricks on me. Like trying to put your kettle on a ring I've put on. Straight to the pigsty. But it's our kettle. It belongs to the state. They are our stove and our kettle. Don't touch them ever again. But we live here now too. There's nothing you can do. You can't get rid of us so easily. You'll leave soon, and we'll stay here. As long as we're here... You'll be civilised. You'll have to reckon with us, because we're stronger. What an argument is "We're stronger"? You'll see what we'll do. We'll see you do your exercise. You'll see. Very well, we'll see. We've only stopped now to not cause any injuries. But the moment any of you are alone, that'll be it. Think it over. Consult with each other. We'll be back and we'll listen to what you have to say. What's there to consult about? Don't you want to put on some dance music? Look, the situation with that homo, that's fine. I support you completely on that. But Kaledin here is a Hero of Socialist Labour. He's an eminent figure. So please all calmly head back inside. Everything's normal, we'll escort you in. You'll go to your rooms and go to bed. It's just, we've got to wind it all down now. This could go on for ages. That's what we were saying. These piss-ups keep happening and it's getting worse. Unfortunately, these piss-ups mow down our ranks. The professors kissed in the canteen. I saw it. The red lips. That's just the start. What if he stayed another week? Without the Yank, nothing more would have happened. We decided to intimidate the professors a bit. You were right to, but let's wrap it up now. Very well. Kiss goodnight. This faggotry will stay here for a long while. When our trainees arrive... I'll give them instructions. Stick to the law, each to his own bed. They're practically brothers. Do you have any roach, Vika? They said we can make an order. That's an odd order. You can read. Here's the menu. Here we go again. Canteen aggression. It's very typical for a waitress. Stop being a smart alec. Why? Better to be thick. We can only be stupid or mess around. I've noticed that. What do you like better? To relax. Relax and enjoy the moment? Sure. How long does it take? Is it slow or quick? The tea? No, the relaxing. Is that a question? Yes, it is. How to relax quickly? No, how do you like to relax? Quickly? Can you translate for me? I don't get what he's saying. Yes, he's flirting. So that's what you call it? Sorry, I'm not used to that. No, it's a purely social question. How do you like to relax? For a long time or a little? It's the black and yellow races destroying the white race. It's a shitty painting. I think so too. The black race is shit. The black race is shit. The white race has always been white race. I want to kill the black race. Has the kettle boiled? Not yet. We could finish it off by painting some slogans on it. Which ones? We have got paint. Didn't we want to make a newspaper? Alexey, take it through to our room. We'll paint something on it. Just take it down for now. We'll come up with something. It brought disagreement. That's much better now. We could paint something too and hang it on the wall. Good idea. We can just paint something as food for thought. I'll paint my arse yellow and sit on the paper. Don't forget to shit on it too, just to make it clear. Olga knows, what she's talking about. Paint your arse yellow, sit on it, make a print and take a shit on it. Olga advised that. It's got to have a meaning. No, it doesn't. Everyone has to decide their own meaning. I suggest you start. Painting? In a bit, we need inspiration. It can't just be any old rubbish. We have no canvas, or paint. So you can pull willpower from nowhere, but not inspiration? Let's go paint. Can't be that hard. Let's go. Right. We had some drawing paper. That's a relic of the past. Who's arse is it going to be? Not mine, it won't fit. It should be the arse of our leader. No. I think so too. Especially as his is the biggest one. Let's toss a coin. We're not doing that, we've decided unanimously. Yes, let's vote. Who is for? Who? For Maxim. Who is for Maxim sitting his arse on the paper? Unanimous, Maxim. Alright then. Not my whole arse, just a couple of crosses. This is essentially art. Modern art. I reckon, we can hang it up straight away. And don't go saying that it's meaningless. I reckon, what I'm creating is actually... Did you give it meaning? We can attach it straight to the other picture. And a bit of oil. Let's quickly think up what the artist intended to express. Then go hang it on the wall. I think it symbolises the beginning and the end. An arrow and a cross. It's very enigmatic. As it's modern art, it shouldn't have any meaning. There should be an enigma. But we're interested in her opinion. No, it's the first picture to have no meaning. Until now, all pictures had some meaning. When people are creative, they can make something new. I think it'd be alright. This will signify the cyclical nature of life, going in circles. Our answer to the West. Wait, the finishing touch. In actual fact. Art doesn't always have to take ages to create. Here we go. The first picture of its kind. Chuck it over here. It doesn't matter if the vase gets broken. That's enough. There we go. Not bad. Why did you ruin the art? I didn't like it. You don't get it. It was for the public. You said that I should judge it. You've upset us. You're not alone here. It's the first picture of its kind, and we agreed with it. I painted it with my bare arse. Did you shove the brush up your anus? No way. That's what I'd proposed. You're too radical. Why? We can't follow your methods. Then it's not painted with your arse. Yes, it is. It was painted on the arse, and it's reflected on this sheet. It's a complete pile of arse. It reflects our modern world. If your world really is a complete pile of arse. Our whole world. Your world. Yours too. The world is communal. Do you live in a different world? No, but every person has their own internal world. Thankfully, he didn't pour his inner world onto the canvas. Those drips are oil, not my inner world. It's like the artist Jackson Pollock from ten years ago. He was funded by the CIA, and sold his paintings for billions. Everything's already been stolen. Even abstract expressionism, paid for by the CIA. Paid for by the CIA? And who did he sell them to? To all kinds of stupid dickheads. The CIA paid, because it was upset that America had no art. So, the CIA made its money back? Of course. So they made a wise investment. Olga, what can you say about this object? I've already said everything. No, be honest. Tell us, what do you see? From the point of view of its meaning. What makes up the picture? If I'm honest, looking at you, you remind me of certain animals. Which? Hyenas. Anything else? Hyenas, that's all. How, exactly? Your faces, and constant giggling. We're all like hyenas? Yes. A pack of hyenas. Right you are. Yes. How awful. Who walk around and devour, devour, devour. What do hyenas usually devour? Everything. She's right, hyenas are scavengers. We eat away things that are rotting. I can see that Olga is a very deep thinker. She realises. Yes, that makes me glad. We eat meat. We sportsmen need nutrition. Decaying meat. Most people fall in love, one way or another. But people usually don't understand what's happening to them. And sometimes they destroy the same love, because of these reasons. Because they really don't know what it is. For some people love is a different way of: How can I utilise another person? It's always the same like, "I love potatoes". What does it mean, "I love potatoes"? I love to eat potatoes. I don't love them another way. So look at most love affairs. It's basically like loving potatoes. Everyone in pairs. Have you ever been in an institute like this? No. This is our Institute. It was built thirty years ago, in 1938. We have lots of different buildings. Look, that's Dau's apartment. On the right are our scientists' living quarters. We have two labs in our Institute. One is over there, and the other is here. Everyone look up there. At the top, where the lights are on. That's the office of our Institute's director. Now, look at how interesting this staircase is. It leads up to that office. As a joke we call it "The Road to God". There is no God, of course, but this name stuck. Let's continue. Hello. We're here to visit Dau. Yes, come on in. Hello. Come on in, comrade children. Nice to meet you. This is Nora, this is Dau. And I'm Denis. This is the delegation of Octobrists and Pioneers. They've come to bring you their best wishes on the 51st anniversary of the Revolution. Hello, children. This is Comrade Maxim. He's participating in a series of important experiments. This is the Institute's director, Comrade Azhippo. Nice to meet you. This is the director of the choir. Here's the author of the song performed by the children. And children from school number 54. Wonderful. We'll sing, alright? If you please. "Some people give honour to riches, others, to comfort reliance" "But we from on high have been granted to choose the labour of science" "To choose the road most intrepid, the path of the great pioneer" "The path on the trail of knowledge, from it we never shall veer" "Science is our happiness, truth is our ideal" "Finding life's integral is a perplexing ordeal" "All these mysteries' puzzles, they make our blood boil" "We creep up to these secrets, science, oh, how I love you" "There's no easy path to contentment, we take risks when the thunder rolls" "Through lighting and tempests we go, to reach all our cherished goals" "We just need to keep our faith, serve the Homeland as best we can" "Cast the pipe dream of glory aside Live in a brotherhood of man" "Science is our happiness, truth is our ideal" "Finding life's integral is a perplexing ordeal" "All these mysteries' puzzles, they make our blood boil" "We creep up to these secrets, science, oh, how I love you" "Oh, what a fleeting joy to open these mysteries up wide" "And how sweet for my soul to swim against the tide" "Refuting all opinions and sneers of those we oppose" "Oh, how we've always dreamt of keeping this path that we chose" "Science is our happiness, truth is our ideal" "Finding life's integral is a perplexing ordeal" "All these mysteries' puzzles, they make our blood boil" "We creep up to these secrets, science, oh, how I love you" I would like to perform a lyrical improvisation for you. If you're interested. On the piano. Don't be shy. Did everyone get something? Comrades, I am very pleased that here and now, today in this house, such different people came together from such different generations. The older generation is made up of great scientists on whom our science depends. And the youngest are our Little Octobrists and Pioneers. We have our own Komsomol members, so the little ones here have someone to look up to. They're healthy, energetic and driven young people. I think the youngest generation is already striving to become like them. You, children, will live under communism. And I am delighted that we could all be here this evening. Thank you all. Goodbye. Kids, anyone who didn't get any sweets, help yourselves. Anya. Yes? Kasya. I wish you the best of health. Thank you for everything you've done for us. Whose is this? Is it yours? It's mine. It's yours. And whose is this? Lovely, those peacocks. Those there, made from metal. Yes, too much trash here. I bet there's cockroaches. Yes. Let's finish on a good note. I'll accompany you on the harpsichord. Go right ahead. I mean on the xylophone. Yes, on the harpsichord. Off we go. That's all, thank you. What do you want more, a boy or a girl? Both. A boy and a girl. What would you call them? I don't know. Sonya for a girl. Anyway, it isn't realistic. Why? Why? How old are you, old man? It's your age that matters, you're the one to carry it. This is not a place for children. There's only Denis. This place was made for Dau. He was meant to do something, but he's just slipped away. Now he sits in his wheelchair and claps his hands. Back. That one there. Get the bucket over its head. Now we paint the slogans on. Fuck, it's putting up a fight. Now paint on it while we can. On its arse write "Shame". Go on, paint it. I can't do it. Go on then. Right on its arse. Don't just stand there, pass the paint. Quiet. "Shame", what now? "Depravity" The main thing is getting it out of here. Do a Star of David. We're against Zionism, aren't we? Get going. Just cut the fucking rope. Where's the knife? Just cut it. I'm holding it. The bitch is grunting. Here you go. The symbol of Zionism, of evil and shame. Hello, animal. Our guest. I suggest we treat our guest to an apple or an orange. What does it like? Should we give it a bowl? Let's give her a banana. Here, Piggy. Eat. It doesn't give a shit. Won't it nip your hand? Put the sack on her head. Want a banana? Stay close. Somewhere here? It will fucking eat anything. They eat people too, if they don't resist. If you don't feed them for ages. They also eat children. There were cases. Their own? If a drunk falls asleep in the pigsty. Human children. Come in, don't be shy. Come in, Kristina. Come feast with us. Join us for supper. Please come through. We have a guest. She's in shock. There's chocolate. Let's give it some chocolate. No, some wine. A nice bit of wine. It already resembles a drunkard. A drunk man becomes a swine. Will a drunk swine become a man? Pour it some wine. I can't find any. Maybe vodka? There's cognac. It gobbles from the bowl, a proper animal. Chomping away. Let's cut onions and make some skewers. We're all experts in it. We're all experts here. This won't be anyone's first time. Did you just go and take it from the pigsty? What difference does it make? Well then? Ask our leader. We've paid for it, haven't we? With a bottle of vodka. It was all honest, all legal. Orderly. Orderly and peaceful. All fair. "Where does the Motherland begin?" Hold it. I cut her ear by accident. Go on. Watch your feet. It'll be even heavier now. Let's hang it up. Let's cut off a leg. Who likes meat off the bone? It's still kicking. Would you like a shoulder piece? Or the head, as a speciality of the house? Seriously, while it's fresh and warm. It's never this fresh. The Hymn of the Scientists. "Some people give honour to riches, others, to comfort reliance" "But we from on high have been granted to choose the labour of science" "To choose the road most intrepid, the path of the great pioneer" "The path on the trail of knowledge, from it we shall not veer" "Science is our happiness, truth is our ideal" "Finding life's integral is a perplexing ordeal" "All these mysteries' puzzles, they make our blood boil" "We creep up to these secrets, science, oh, how I love you" "Oh, what a fleeting joy to open these mysteries up wide" "And how sweet for my soul to swim against the tide" "Refuting all opinions and sneers of those we oppose" "Oh, how we've always dreamt of keeping this path that we chose" "Science is our happiness, truth is our ideal" "Finding life's integral is a perplexing ordeal" "All these mysteries' puzzles, they make our blood boil" "We creep up to these secrets, science, oh, how I love you" Everything's alright. Move the ropes. Let's not go outside all bloody. Lads. Actually, we just wanted to have a bit of a joke, but then I suddenly had the idea that we should eat it. Kristina, why are you upset? I see what a monster you are. Why? Do you think that slaughtering a piggy makes you a monster? If you do it in front of people. No, it's what's called... A banquet. An initiation. Like when you go to a restaurant. Please, get your hands away from me. You say: "I want that sturgeon." And they serve it to you. We served you some piggy. I don't want to see it killed. I don't want to see your hands covered in blood. Is my service too intrusive? Comrade Blinov. I've been having some thoughts regarding our experiments. Shall we have a chat? I'll just take the shirt off, it got a bit dirty. Calm down. Fuck off. Alina, don't. She's hysterical, pay no attention. Yeah, I understand. Fuck right off. In some countries that's called torture, what we had to see just now. I've seen things that are a lot worse. I believe you, but we haven't. People are different. They are. I don't really believe in Heaven, nor in hell or any of that metaphysics, but there must be something, life must go somewhere. Who knows? Perhaps it goes back into the cosmos, back to where it came from. I get the feeling that all religions are similar. There's some kind of force, or God, or Absolute, or fuck knows what. And it's sowing the seeds of consciousness here. Like how we sow rye or wheat. Then the seeds grow. Your conciousness develops, then you die. And your consciousness is freed. And is once again drawn back into the Absolute. Like iron filings to a magnet. And I think that Christians and all the rest say that when you die, all the lambs and the poor in spirit get to Heaven. The sheep get drawn up there. Well, who are the lambs? On the other hand, some philosophical doctrines say that after death, the people who became complete, don't rot and don't get consumed by the Absolute. They pass through the Absolute and remain conscious. Fyodorov. "The Basics of Cosmonautics" People turn into beings made from light, living in the universe and feeding off light. I like that. If the aim of life is to strive for self-perfection, you become a perfect entity made of light. But if you're a sheep or a vegetable and you die, this God or Heaven just devours you. It will consume you and absorb you. You'll become food. I have this idea. It's been in my head for quite a long while. Sadly, it's not very likely to be realisable in the foreseeable future. A funeral parlour. A thermonuclear laser funeral parlour. The idea is that in the thermonucelar process matter turns into energy. E=mcÂ² There's no question of that. The link between matter and energy has been proven. But if we take this energy, pump it into a laser, and send it off as light in a predetermined direction, we could possibly bring life to other planets, other worlds. At the end of the voyage, at the end of the beam. But you'd need powerful thermonuclear reactors with the capabality of processing a whole body. That, unfortunately, for the moment, is inaccessible. I expect some rich eccentrics in the West would take up the offer. At the first opportunity. Yes. Although thermonuclear research is advancing fast, it's still not possible to transform more than a few molecules into energy. How would you want to be buried if you died? If possible, like that. The thermonuclear way? Yes. We can make a broth with this. Yes, we can. Great, just like it was. Brilliant. And you were worried about the rug. Brought it back, have you? Yes, we brought it back. You should've waited for it to dry. Walking on a wet rug's a fucking nightmare. There are foot prints anyway. We don't fucking need it. We'll eat a bit later. If you wanna do the other one. Is there a knife? Yes, grab it. Take a look, there are some big ones. No, give it back. The cook said we need to watch out. If the pig had been with a boar, then the meat will stink and won't be very tasty. With a boar? If a boar had fucked it. That's why all women, who've been fucked stink. Yes, they stink. You can't eat them. "You can't fuck me over, no, those are flowers that I know" "A pump is big, but those flowers aren't" "Lily of the valley, of the fucking valley" "Fucking lily of the valley" "you springtime flowers" "You brought your dick, big as a hose, shook it right under my nose" "and you told me that it was a lily of the valley" "You can't fuck me over, no, those are flowers that I know" "your dick was big, those flowers aren't" "Lily of the valley, of the fucking valley" "Fucking lily of the valley, you springtime flowers" Why are these devils just destroying it all? Sometimes there's a stretch when some things are allowed. Sometimes it lasts a long time. Sometimes not long at all. And then it ends, and the devils come. And they destroy everything. They're honest devils, they told us they were devils. I tried to speak with them about culture. They understand everything about culture. It's not culture they don't get. But killing a pig in the dining room? That's not to do with culture. They can explain it from a cultural point of view. It's not a matter of culture, it's simple. We build, they destroy. Does it smell? Hardly at all. I reckon we should make a bonfire from the cigarettes. Why are you sniffing that? She licked it. That's jam. It reminds me of childhood. How so? My granddad killed pigs, and I'd sit under the table like this. Kristina. Put the knife away. Kristina, come on in. Come in, don't be shy. We've got some meat, some kebabs. I won't eat that meat. Why? Probably because I'm a hypocrite. Fuck, I'm sorry. Look at you, you fatty. Do you like living like this? I'm to take the blow, Maxim? Don't be afraid of the knife. Like fuck I'm afraid, I don't give a shit any more. The fact that it's me who's taking the blows and not a man. What a kindergarden. Come on then, one on one. Even if you pass out, I'll control you. He will get tired. I don't want to hit him, I don't like hitting people. We're gonna beat him to death. He stabbed me. Let's finish her off. You're wounded. You're wounded means you're killed. So you have to finish me off? Of course, we have to. Of course we have to finish you off. So I don't suffer? Of course. How do you all know how to deal with people? Of course, we know a bit about how to deal with people. Fuck, I've got blood on my shoes. Maksim, let's decide what it is. Is it depravity or creativity? Pants off. You need to undress. I can undress. Is it creative? A naked body? Hell knows. He's just told me it's creativity. What's so creative about it? Never seen a naked body? I haven't. Is this creative? I suppose so. There's a lot of anger in that. It's called jealousy. Maxim, it's a sin. No. You idiot. I never liked that painting. It's my turn, Maxim. Throw it. Ira, dear, out of the way. Hello. Come in, Maxim. Take off your coat and take a seat. I can't tell you everything. You'll have to read between the lines. A decision has been made concerning the Institute. By those at the very top. It's that this establishment should cease to exist. Not just on paper, not just a new name. No, that's useless. This rot will always crawl to the surface. However you try to reform it, whoever the employees are. The very stones are soaked in this rot. Nothing must remain. Neither the buildings, nor the documents, equipment, and devices. Everything should vanish. And most importantly: All of the employees must be liquidated. There should be no mercy. Neither for women, nor the elderly. There were different opinions about where to draw the line. Maybe some lab assistants are not part of this, but it has been decided: The whole abscess must be torn out with the roots. That's the only way to prevent this rot from spreading. Everyone has to be liquidated. You are the ones to do it. Your group will be increased in number. There'll be around thirty of you. The Institute will be surrounded by troops. They won't know anything, they will just isolate the area. Setting it on fire is forbidden. We are in the centre of the city. The Institute is acoustically well insulated. Nothing will be heard beyond the walls. This will take a lot of time. This work is hard, it requires a lot of responsibility. No one must survive. When? I can't tell you yet, but in the nearest future. This will open up a bright future for all of you. In this future, we will always take into account, who you are. A happy future for our white children. Yes. I see. All clear? Very clear. I was in heaven. And I was being judged. And then some angels came and pushed me out. And said: "You have to go" So I'm going with the angels. So I'm going with the angels. And we go all the way. And we found a carcass. A dead body on the road. And they say: "Crawl into it" I say: "I don't want to crawl into" "a dead creature" So they say, "You have to" I didn't want to, so they beat me up. Until I crawled in. How the soul cries, disappointed. The soul doesn't want to go to earth. As a soul, you are given a job. If you fail, you are sent back. You die, you see. You die. But your soul is not clean. So it has to be sent to the laundry. What you do in hell is just... You get washed.
