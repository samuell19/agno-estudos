[gunfire] [phone rings] Rescue. Yes, sir. Position: Fox King 3148. Standby. Spot that. [alarm sirens] Yes, sir. We'll call. Fox K, right? Oh, this small infantry patrol on an intelligence mission back in the lines, they've got a man with a leg wound. Their position will be marked with a yellow X Right here. Clear! [engine whirring] Your chopper will receive the usual fighter escort. there will be 5,000 jets in the vicinity if you need them. Any questions? No, sir. Lieutenant. Remember, you're flying a helicopter, not a jet. Yes, sir. [pilot] Pedro Abel, it's your final escort. Now, they think that we won't be ready for them. But we will. We're pulling in every ounce of manpower we got. And our fighters and bombers will clobber them all the way to I mean, Force 2 Sounds like quite a ball game. The World Series. Now, the gentlemen and Junior-C expect maximum effort from Rescue 2. If they got any weak spots, patch 'em up now. Wednesday, it'll be too late. We're going all out. Coronel, it seems to me that we go all out everyday. Yeah. Now, you here, and a flyup at Adam KE-3 to be closer to the action and any they happen to bring along. As well as the usual pickup for frontline movement. We'll be ready soon. Captain, I regard you as my most promising element commander. But I'm disturbed, captain. I'm disturbed because you have more choppers redex in the last few weeks than any element out here. Sir, I know that our in-commission rides have been way off, We've been flipping every chopper we can get our hands on into Korea. Even before the paint is dry! Right now, every chopper is worth its weight in diamonds. But they just simply aren't enough of 'em! I can't even give you cover choppers. Every helicopter that's out in action means that there are some men out there with men will be there to pick up. Coronel... Every aircraft in this element is been redex, that's been ready for when we need it again. We completed every mission, sir. And good thing you have. I'd like a right now. In tactical effect on this, I still have no complaint, but I don't know how long will that last. And I'm sure incomissioned ride-on aircraft improves, - and fast. - It will, sir. Maybe you'll fail in pressure, pilots but the helicopter is rugged. - It's a fighter or a bomber. - Yes, sir. I'm doing my best, sir. Yeah, I'm sure of it. Russ, how long has it been since you got a full night's sleep? Oh, I don't know. I suppose, maybe-- Yeah, well, you want to be careful, or you're going to fall right flat in your face. I understand you taking more "rough missions" than anybody else on the element. Then, when you're flying... I don't know where you've heard that, sir. You're skipping needles and grinding your way in here. And then at night, when you should be getting at least a few hours of sleep, you're over the flashbacks checking up on maintenance. How about a week in Tokyo for rest and recreation? Yeah, it's a good idea, Colonel but not right now, thanks. Alright, Captain. Something's wrong here. - Fix it. - Can be sure of that, sir. How do you feel, soldier? I had better captain. Well, let's get back to the taxi - Good fellas! - Come on, boy. Pedro Abel, this is Oscar Baker. [pilot] Roger, Oscar Baker. Does your wingman copy? We're taking off now. [gunfire] They're the rest of my patrol! The rest of my patrol have been taken down to the back of the field! Lieutenant, lieutenant. [gunfire] - - [] Yes, sir. He says they're trapped. It'll be a wipeout. [Pete] I said, we're closing in first. Oh, why don't these puny pinwheels carry any weapons? Why do you think we got a rotor craft? What about flying those jets? Ok, you call it. Meanwhile, I'm going down. You maniac! This isn't a fighter plane! this is Pedro Abel. this is Pedro Abel. What the...? You idiot! Why in front of its guns!? Could have cut us to pieces! I didn't. You're in for a surprise, brother. See that stop? We distracted them. They don't know what to think. Light up the flare gun. For what? It's smoke. It's hard to tell an attack. Anyway, spotted for the fighters. Give them a marker. Let's fire something out of anything. Oh, if only I had a saber. [gunfire] There we go. [gunfire] [gunfire] He's trying to Where are those fighters? this is Pedro Abel. Can you see them? Roger, old boy. We haven't spotted to go. What do you mean? Chopper, get your tail out of the way. Move! [cheering] Looks bad, eh? Some bullet holes on the rotor blade, and maybe some other damage. Can't tell ya. You're lucky the gas tanks weren't hit. - Yeah. - Up close it was just routine ground fire we ran into. What he doesn't know will never hurt him. Don't mention that tank and I guarantee you'll never hear another word about it. [Russ] Of all the idiotic, maniac, lunatic stunts just for a useless glory grab, this one takes the pride. I couldn't believe my ears when the reports came in. Trying to turn your chopper into a fighter plane. Why don't I hang you out of the end of one of those rotor blades and let it spin? You, Tim, why didn't you stop him? They couldn't. I first exercised my command authority. [Russ] Command... You aren't fit to command a pinball machine. Somebody had to get there fast, captain. Other surrounding can take care of that! You escort the fighter planes! Why do you think they give every chopper for a fighter captain? Mister, if you've done it our way, those infantry boys would have received all the help they needed just as fast, and with this one difference: Instead of being all fouled-up by unnecessary battle damage, your chopper would be sitting out there right now, ready for the next poor Joe back on the lines when I need it! - One of those choices? - No, Lieutenant. It wasn't one of those choices. I'd try every way I don't have. And pound through your head why those choppers must be flown the way we say. [Russ] How many times have I told you in the past six weeks that this is an air rescue outfit? Not a playground for frustrated hack rocks. Sir, I'm a jet pilot. I was trained to be one, I think like one. There's nothing else I wanna be. I didn't volunteer for helicopters. You can get rid of me anytime. Don't you push the panic button on me, Lieutenant. By the way, you should hear some of the other fellas' feedback about having to fly with you. Their beefing? What about my beef? I arrived in Japan with my jet squadron! And the next thing I know, I'm over here flying choppers! Why? Because I made the sad mistake back in 1945 of having some helicopter training. So instead of being there in the batter's box, you make me a boy down here, hustling a water bottle! Lieutenant... You haven't been around the fire risk command long enough to be aware of it. But over in Tokyo, you walked into a bar full of jet pilots. They find out you fly helicopters, and I've got news for you: you can't pay for a drink. Nobody admires jet pilots more than I do! But this war isn't being fought for your convenience or for mine! You were transferred here by personnel in Tokyo for the good of the service. Because, right now, the scariest things in the Air Force happens to be helicopter pilots. Helicopters, choppers, pinwheels... Those things were invented by an army rubric at G.I. Haircuts. And some joker discovered they can fly. Well, I want no part of it. Let me get back to jets. Let me buy the drinks! Transfer me! How many times do I have to ask you? Will you bounce me out? No, because you're needed here and as long as you're needed here, you'll stay. You'll do the job you're supposed to do the way you're supposed to do it! Our way! The Air Rescue way! I know it's there and I intend to bring it out. Whether I want to stay or not, huh? You think I'd take the easy way out? Maybe a court martial transfers you a pass along with some other element command and letting you be his headache? Be a cinch, a breeze! But I'm not ducking anything! Not even you! Now, I'm not going to end in court martial because you didn't directly disregard any order. Imma hit you with an Article 15 instead. There'll be a fine for the time being. That's all I intend to do about that. Sir, look. I can do a jet squadron a lot of good. According to you, I'm not doing your outfit any good at all. Lieutenant, let's get one thing very, very clear. I personally am gonna make you the air rescue pilot you want to be and can be. I personally am going to put you over every jump, through every hoop, sweat you through every rough mission until you know what the score is. Until you know why every man here wouldn't be in any other outfit in the United States Army, Navy, Marine Corps or Air Corps. Until you know what the Air Rescue Service means. Not only to us, but to the men we pick up and bring back. And to their families, too. Then you're living and breathing Air Rescue on every single pore. Until your pride to carry that water bottle put rescue in the side of an and I intend to do that even if it kills me or you! You're dismissed, Lieutenant. - Sergeant. - Good morning, Captain. - How is she? - Gonna patch up soon. - Found all the parts I needed. - That's good. Captain. It will still show an off But, you know, Another chopper redex when Colonel Stoneham looks over the report. I know. Well, sir, I could just as easily... No, no, Joe. That's all. Don't you cut any corners for me. Just include it with the rest. Yes, sir. - Is it ready to test up? - Yes, sir. I'll check her out myself. [engine noises] Nice going, Joe. I don't know what I'd do without you. Gonna refuel her and take her for redex. sir. Hmm. Oh, Joe. Lt. Stacy been around the to see how things are going. No, sir. Well, I'm afraid not. So, you know, it may have - a couple of things. - Yeah. You pass the word that I want to see him in my quarter. Yes, sir. A little communication came in this morning from Headquarters to all rescue elements. I thought I'd share it with you. Here. Suppose you'll read it. Out loud, nice and loud. "To all helicopter elements: flying safety is the business of every officer and man in this command. The same time the General is trying to develop a larger and stronger air rescue service, he is demanding that his pilots fly safely." - Look, I've heard all of this. - Keep reading. "A rescue aircraft, which is up for repairs and which crashes before it reaches the distressed pilot--" Now comes the sentimental part. "...because some clown is flying it, is no good to anybody. A safe flying aircraft can carry out its job as a matter of routine." Look, do I have to-- Right down to the last period. "After the rescue mission has risked enough for not adding unnecessary ones, period." Say, Lieutenant, Col. Phillip Stoneham, Squadron Commander, alias, Mr. Bear Grip himself. He paid us a little visit yesterday while you were playing helicopter hopscotch with that tank. I thought you might have noticed that the walls are still scorched. Does that take care of today's hoops, sir? As a matter of fact, there is nothing whatsoever to do while I called you about. I'm flying up to K76 tonight for an hour or so. They brought in some new jet pilots from Japan for the big strike. They're from your old outfit. I'm briefing about rescue techniques and, thinking it over this morning, I thought you'd want to come along. Me? Yeah, I can't think of anybody better qualified to tell your old buddies what air rescue is all about. How important rescue can be to a pilot when the chips are down. Especially if he... If he knows his techniques and sticks to them. Look, sir, there's a lot of men in this outfit better qualified for this job than me. Lieutenant, I wouldn't dream of having anyone else go along. I admire the way you carry a movie projector. Yes, sir. [muttering] Need any help, Pete? No thanks, Smiley. tell how do you like it in Rescue. Oh, it's very educational. I've attended more lectures than I ever did in college. How you coming, Lieutenant? I guess that's got it. Ready, sir. Men, before we brief you in our procedures, we're going to run off some familiarization film on rescue aircraft. Lights, Lieutenant, if you don't mind. Thanks, Danny. It's always nice to know the equipment you can count on. [whistling] [muttering, laughter] [laughter] Sorry, wrong films, but... Mighty nice equipment. Now that we know you're paying attention, here we go. Looks like they needed rescue. [laughter] [laughter continues] [laughter continues] [Russ] By all of these efforts came efforts like these. [Russ] This is a Navy rescue. [Russ] The Marines in the Army, as well as the Air Force are all developing the uses of choppers and experiments like these. Pave the way with ships like these. [Russ] Now, Air Force air rescue involves much more than a helicopter. The situations require we utilize especially equipped SV-29. Outfitted to drop the A-3 airborne life boat, courtesy of the Air Force As well as that magnificent all-around work horse, the SA-16 Albatross, which you'll get to know as Dumbo. These aircrafts will be on strict alert, or orbiting around the water areas whenever you're flying. [Russ] In Korea, you'll be seeing us around in the H-5 or bigger brother, the X-19. Now, above all, don't forget this little item. Your URC4 radio transceiver. Without it, we couldn't have made 90% of the behind-the-lines pickups accomplished thus far. Now, I'd like to present someone who understands your problems as well as ours. Someone you all know. Lt. Pete Stacy, himself a retired jet pilot. [muttering] [Pete] Well, officer... [clears throat] Nice to be back visiting. There's not an awful lot that I can add to what Captain Edwards has already told you. We'll do a job well if you... Give us a break by sticking to the procedures. Captain Edwards said. Oh, yeah, one thing. We don't want you to have any false pride. I mean about calling in to a rescue. We're here, so... So don't wait until the last minute to let us know you need help. [Pete] Even if you think you can make it back without having to bail out. Oh, another thing: If you can, always bail out to our waters, so that the Dumbos or SV-29s can help you too. But yea, but, suppose we can't make it to the sea, Pete. [Pete] Well, Smiley, in that case, when you hit the ground, you stay undercover while you wait for the chopper to arrive. [Pete] When it arrives, you head for the center of the clearing, release your smoke flare, to indicate one direction. [Pete] When the chopper lands, get in as fast as possible. Don't let that soup spill over. If there are any reds, the fighter cap will beat up the area with machine gun fire, rockets, napalm, before we can come in. You see, the helicopter carries no armament whatsoever. Its sole purpose is to get in and get you out. And nothing else- You may want to mention the speed angle, Pete. These choppers of ours, they don't quite go around breaking the sound barrier. They go about 1/6th as fast as a jet. [Pete] And sometimes they look like a couch up on a rock. So, be patient, fellas. As you can see, we've got our limitations. You know how it is. Many times you fellas get too cocky about being hot rod pilots. Pete and I just want you to ask yourselves one thing. Can you make your planes fly backwards? Thanks, Lieutenant, that was well done. I'm sure that these men know they can count on you and on every man like you. [Russ] Now, this one last thing. The range of a chopper is limited. So we have an advanced element preliminary stationed way up here in an offshore island we've been able to hold. It's code name is KA3. As you can see, it's very deep in enemy territory I've tried to night bomb it frequently, and every mission out there is usually for air rescue. So we like to feel that it's manned by a most dependable pilot, and for that reason I'm assigning one more good man there tomorrow. Lt. Stacy. I'm sure you know they'll never let you down. [muttering] Thanks, gentlemen. Thank you, [muttering] - Oh, - [explosion] I'm glad you got here before I left. Well, we're on the move. Looks like Intelligence was right. You're just in time for the Oh, I'm sorry to on the last minute, but I've figured out, with all this heavy activity, I ought to have you up here with Rescue Control. Can Jeff Brown handle your K-5 in the element for today? Yes, sir, he's right on top of that. Good. How are things up in the island? last night. Didn't hit enemy. Oh, there are pilots Well, I'll for this one. Medium bombers coming in from Japan, Okinawa. Jets and the offshore carriers in marine bases. F-51s in the Australian Air Force. recon, Canadian. Our own Saber jets and fighter bombers. Maximum effort, all the way down the line. [alarm siren] [explosion] [gunfire] [gunfire] [pilot] I got it. A call of perimeter 645 [pilot 2] I'll take it as a cinch. You see that guy at 3:00? Righto, lil' boy. That trap is all mine. [pilot 3] Real Cool to Deep Sea Doodle I'm sitting on your shoulders. [gunfire] [pilot] Mayday! Rescue controllers, it's Blue Boy-3. I'm here. On the Fox-J sector, 4168 . Blue Boy-3. Mayday Boy-3, this is Rescue Control. Can you make it to the ocean? Over. No, I Over. Ok, Boy, we'll send you a ride. Keep radio contact with your wingman. You'll make it. [telephone rings] - [explosions] - To Rescue Control. Have ready the chopper KA-3. Pete, we've got one. Blue Boy-3, got it. Res cap will be White Night leader with three checks. Roger. Alright, now lift off. And try to not get yourself in anything you can't get out off. Alright, one hour from flight DFK-59. Going out! Blue Boy-4, this is Blue Boy-3. Can you read? Can you read? Pedro Abel, this is Blue Boy-4. Passing to identification of Blue Boy-3. [BB-4] Seems quiet. - We'll watch for you. - Roger, Blue Boy-4. Approaching sector. [gunfire] take a trolley! Sure wish they were all like this! That's out of pasture. Not even suffering from nervous exhaustion. Rescue Control, this is Pedro Abel. Pickup completed. Over. Pedro Abel, this is Rescue Control. Can you handle other pickups now? Over. [Pete] Sure, if we can use sweat for fuel. And just about make it back to K-3. Roger, return to base. [telephone rings] Rescue Control. Mayday, Russ. This is Joker-2 on Doll Channel. I got another mayday, Pete. From JOC. You in, [Joker-2] Alright, stay along. I'm alright, Lieutenant. I can make it back to base. You've got to refuel. You're losing altitude. You'll hit the mountains. Leave it! I don't wanna jump. make it back. Lazy Joker-2. This is Rescue Control. Do you read me? Rescue Control, this is Lazy Joker-2. Read you. 5-Square, over. Head for water. Over. [LJ2] My You gotta fly west. Head for area C-3. Choppers and Dumbos are committed. An SV-29 will drag you a life boat. I'll make it back [Russ] Rescue Team, do what we say. Head for water. Don't worry, boy, your buddies will stick with you. - Can you find Sam? - No. Flying sure is Rescue Control, this is Clover Charlie. [CC] Located downed pilot making run for life control. Roger, Clover. Give me a [CC] Rescue Control, this is Clover Charlie. The boat must have hit a floating mine. Found him alive, but is hurt. There's no life raft. I don't think I can get another one. He needs a chopper. Over. I don't have a chopper. [pilot] Without a chopper, he's had it. Rescue Control, this is Lazy Joker-1 What are you guys going to do about Lazy Joker-2? I'm diverting an SA-16 from K-74. He won't last that long, And what if the Dumbo can't land? Then what? - [LJ1] Send a chopper! - The choppers at KA-3 are out. They're low on fuel. [LJ1] Can't scratch him off like he was nothing. He's drifting off to the sea! You'll have to depend on the SA-16 to make a pickup. [LJ1] He'll be dead by then! [Russ] Maybe not, if he can as long as you can. Rescue Control, this is Pedro Abel, over. Rescue Control to Pedro Abel, go ahead. It's a long chance, but... I might make that pickup. You haven't got the fuel. It's too far off your course. I can try. Rescue Control, this is Lazy Joker-1. Let the chopper try it. Then begin with the works, including the man he just picked up. The answer is no. Pedro Abel, this is Rescue Control. Return to KA-3, refuel and then backup the Dumbo. It'll take too long. Besides, pick 'em. [Pete] pick 'em up when we get back. What are you trying to do? Pick up a drowning jet pilot depending on me. Better find him fast, or we'll be down there with him. Slats, you see him? Yes! Out there about 3:00. Looks like he's passed out. How you doing, Slats? Thought I joined the Air Force, not the Navy. How's your patient? [Slats] Supply sea force. He'll pull through alright. He'll survive if we take him to a hospital before too long. We're coming to a hospital. Oh, on our backs? Can't reach the island. We're running on fumes now. I'll pull up in the first gas station I see. this time. Rescue Control, it's Lazy Joker-1. Rescue successful. [LJ1] We're going out now. Lazy Joker-1, this is Rescue Control. How is picked-up ? [LJ1] A helicopter. Your chopper did a great job. Thanks. sure one chopper at the island. Call them. I don't know. Maybe for good. What are you looking for? A Relax. Run out of gas, on enemy territory, an injured guy on the back, and he says "relax." Why am I This is Pedro Abel. We're low on gas. [gunfire] That's what I've been looking for. Heard about truck camp this morning. - - Could be. The fuel tank should be well up now. The gas some kind of flag jumped over and rolled the engine. Five men are worth more than one engine. Sure, but don't worry. get a couple of guns, a good aviation. tank. switch over to the truck gas. Slats! Is there a trouble? No sweat, sir! I don't see a thing! - How you doing? - Well done. Ok, let's fire her up. Ready? Come in, Slats. Oh, very well. [engine clanking] [engine roars] [engine stops] What do we do now, look? [engine clanking] [engine whirring] - How about - No, let's hold out. aviation guys. Switch over the truck. [rumbling] This is one case where every knock is a push. See that, Lieutenant? What did I tell you all along? There was no doggone thing to worry about. Rest Cape 3. This is Rescue Control. Go ahead, Tim. Oh... Lt. Stacy, I heard you made it. Back at base with two rescued men. One needs hospitalization. [Russ] The Dumbo will be there in ten minutes. The same one that arrived to pick that man out of the sea not five minutes behind you. - I see. - [Russ] Right now, you're my favorite candidate for How did you make it back? I, uh, I worked it up. We'll talk about that tomorrow. I shall live until tomorrow. How's your chopper? [Pete] It's ok, I guess. It's got its back alright. So long, sir. You look like you had a rough time up there. I stressed my luck mighty today. Harry, maybe this stress so I can snap right back and knock my teeth out. I've got to do a compression check before it's up again. Maybe even a new engine. What if you just drain the truck fuel, clean up the tank, put in aviation gas? Will anybody know the difference? Next guy who flies it. Well, then, I better be the next guy. Whatever you say, Lieutenant. [panting] [medic] How you doing, boy? Ok. Thanks. I'm having trouble taking the air. Trouble? Our commander loves him like a brother. Yeah, like Cain loved Abel. Tim, Slats, can I see you outside a minute? Sure. Lieutenant, would you holler if you need me? [Pete] Sure, buddy. Good fellas, I guess I really out on that truck gas tale. Joe thinks the engine is in pretty bad shape. That's what I tried to tell you. Look, that chopper has to go up before the replacement arrives. I'm taking it up. It may be a tricky ride, so... I rather take it alone. You're the boss, sir. Like I said, beat up the chopper? Yeah, I got one bad blade and a bullet hole in the fuel tank. I'm going to call Russ. Looks like you're in the barrel, sir. With the replacements flying, looks like yours is the only chopper that might get off the ground. I guess I had it coming to me. I tried my best to fix the chopper up good, sir. I worked on it all night. Thanks, Joe. [phone rings] Yes, this is Rescue Control. I need a chopper at KE-3. Pete, we got one. [Russ] Now, tell you Your best route is north upon , 3,000ft. Avoid the MSR, and good luck. Joe, I got to push her a long way. Think she will hold up? Oh, we've done the best we can do here, sir. She'll make it a little sticky. Can't tell, but... She ought to be ok. Thanks a million, Joe. Junior This is Pedro Abel. Have you located your man yet? Pedro Abel, this is Junior , this is Danny. Smiley's down there. [ ] I've made a positive identification. Going down together. You spot any Reds around? No. Place seems quiet as a church yard. How sure are you? Oh, come on. I said it's ok. Pick him up. Then if those Commies hide under rocks... - You've always-- - [] What are you waiting for? I'll go in and make a slow pass. If there are any Commies down there, they'll take a shot at me. Jet jockeys. Can't reason with them. There is nothing down there except Smiley waving at the bus stop. It's your move. Roger. Smiley, this is Pete. How does the ground look for landing? Very rough. Roger, boy. That'll be a swing pickup. Head for the south of the clearing and give me the smoke. Got ya. Got ya. Hey, did you see that? Looks like a windshield reflection. From a truck or jeep. Yeah, what do you think? I don't know. and the place is blazing. I don't like it. It's too quiet. I can see the pilot jumping and waving. That's Smiley alright. He's been my wingman. No sign of any hostiles down there But I could have sworn that reflection came of a wind shield. a signal I don't like it. Come on. Come on! Pete! What goes, Pete? You're getting chicken bumps? Smiley's down there! I know it. I saw something in the hillside retreating. Could be a windshield. And it goes on a screen Papa Junior-3, this is Pedro Abel. [Smiley] See I wanna coming. Gonna pick me up! Just want to make sure, Smiley. [Pete] You see any movement around the brush? Or over by those trees? Look carefully. Sure, sure. There's nothing over there! Your eyes peeled. say so? If you don't go down, I'll shoot you down. Danny, line up for the fighter cab. You may have better targets than me- Come on! I still don't like it, Tim. Just a hunch. Pete, you think they might be using this as a decoy for an ambush? That's exactly what I was thinking. Still is a buddy of mine, Tim. What did Cpt. Russ tell us? I can say this is a risk we have to take. I think he'd say, this is what we're here for. Good. I owe Smiley at least one try. Let's go down. Slats, we're going in. I guess this is what the colonel meant when he said every rescue mission has risk enough for not adding unnecessary ones. Well, you live and learn. If you live. [grunts] We lost him! He's been hit! Tim too! Are you ok, Pete? He says we can't make it to the Talk to Rescue Control. Uh-huh, got it. - Pete - Yeah. Paramedic radio to fighter captain. Pete's been hit in the chest. He needs a doctor before he can be moved. The person that has volunteered to go, He's waiting the chopper. I'll fly this one myself. Harry, you're co-pilot. Now, let's go. [shouting] Boy, I'm glad to see you. - How's ? - Man, not good. Is there any Reds coming in? Yeah, there's a bunch moving this way. Doc, you have to work fast. Russ, I'm going to need at least 20 minutes without interruption. Can you range it? I'll do my best. Hi, Russ. How you've been? I brought you that water bottle personally. Full of plasma. What I needed. Thank you, Russ. Ah, you're gonna be alright. You haven't fired your arm yet. The first patrol we spotted was probably heading this way. Look at the wrecked chopper. What about pilot ? Too soon. Someone was still pulling through. you can. Pick by the radio, the doctor's gonna give us a call. - back and pick me up. - Right. I'll set up a false camp fire, divert them. If that doesn't work, there's one more thing we can try. Harry, I want to see you being a sitting duck. Huh? Well, you're gonna be one now, so let's go. [shouts] [shouts in Korean] These flares left? That's the last one. next one's waiting. Looks like they'll make this one too tight. fly off. - [gunshot] - Hey! Alright, call the fighter captain! take cover. [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshots] , this is Pedro Abel. Right under sniper fire. Can you give us any position? We need to fighter in top of them. I can't see them. They're well-hidden. No idea where. does any good if you can't spot the targets. [fighter] We'll try. Watch for us. What now? Gonna get a target they can't miss. I hope that they do. [gunshot] [gunshot] How much is longer? Ten minutes! Larsen needs only needs 10 more minutes. When are you coming in? [gunshot] That was close! Can you see anything? Not a thing. We got fighter jets, you spot any movement, [gunshot] Russ, you see that? Five minutes! Lieutenant. [gunshot] [gunfire] All right. Yeah, Close quarters. getting closer. Coming in! [explosion] [explosion] Alright, let's go. [gunshot] So, bear in mind that Air Rescue can do a lot for you, provided you give us the cooperation we need. I used to be a jet jockey myself. So an important little thing called good of the service came up, [Pete] So I know how little most of you know about the problems of air rescue. And now I'd like you to see some films about our aircraft. Captain. [Pete] The lights, if you don't mind. It's always wise to know the equipment we have ready. [laughter, whistling] Sorry, wrong film. [Pete] But, uh, mighty nice equipment. Now that we know you're paying attention, here we go.
