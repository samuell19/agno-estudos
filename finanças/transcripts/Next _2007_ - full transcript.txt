Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the man who knows what you're going to do before you do it. The amazing Frank Cadillac! Here's to world peace. Good evening. Welcome to beautiful downtown Las Vegas. How many people are here from the Orient? Raise your hands. You, sir. Where are you from? No, wait! Wait. Don't tell me. I'm sensing you must have soul. You're a Seoul man. Why don't you share with everyone where you're from? - Korea. - How about that, folks? And may I assume that this charming young lady is your daughter? - She's my wife! - Well, of course she is! And what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. - What's your name? - Yong Kyunge. Yong Kyunge. Would you be kind enough to join me up on stage, please? Are you serious about this guy? This a joke? Want me to round up some mimes and clowns while we're at it? Yong Kyunge, what if I told you that that pretty necklace you're wearing has a broken catch, and on my count of three, will fall into your drink? Wouldn't that be something? Wouldn't that just blow your mind? - Yeah. - Yes! Wouldn't it blow all your minds? Three, two, one, now. Did somebody say "spooky"? Wait a minute. Look at your glass. Where'd it go? Yong Kyunge, why don't you look inside my pocket? Reach in. Dig deep. Let's have a big hand for Yong Kyunge. That's magic, folks, and that's why I'm here. You've probably seen a lot of those shows. Mentalists. Magicians. Illusionists. You'd be shocked to know that sometimes, not often, but sometimes, it's the real deal. Masquerading as an act. Hiding behind a few $50 tricks. Hiding in plain sight. Because if the magician doesn't do that, the alternative is impossible for others to live with. Anyway, Wednesday night at the Back Page doesn't pay very well, so I gamble. But I don't play against other people. Only against the house. So, no mega-jackpots, no long shots. The idea is to go unnoticed. That way, I can keep coming back. I'm not a god. I can't see everyone's future. Only my own. And only within two minutes. Except for when I saw her. But we'll come back to that. There's no pattern to this guy. He's all over the map. Well, he's not counting. Not off the top of a five-deck shoe. Wait a minute. Isn't that that two-bit magic act over at the Back Page? - What's his name? - Cadillac. Yeah, that's Frank Cadillac. Is he pulling tricks on us? Is that legal? You can't trick the deck. I'm telling you, that little prick knows what's coming. If he's running that good a system, why is he not betting more? That's going to be my second question. Look at that. He's looking right at us. It's like he can hear us. - What table was that? - 27. This is Roybal. Give me two men on table 27. I'm coming right down. Place your bets, please. Here's the thing about the future. Every time you look at it, it changes because you looked at it. - Hi. - And that changes everything else. $9,070. Empty the drawer. Move! Drop the gun! Now! $9,070. Drop the gun! Step back! It's his gun. He was going to shoot two people! Step back. We'll settle this right now. What's he doing? Secure the doors, elevators, escalators, every way out of this damn place! Now! Freeman, seal off the blackjack tables. Sullivan, link up with Roybal. We're on the floor. On the floor right now. Bring up the other cameras. That way. This way. He's right next to you. $10 slots, aisle 14. There he is! Behind you! Your left! Turn around! He's right between you! He's in the men's room near the gift shop. Gift shop! Gift shop! Davis, where the hell is he? Black T-shirt, straw hat! Heading towards the entrance! Come on, let's go. Call Vegas P.D. Just stole a silver Charger, tag 585G4S. Drop the gun! Step back. He rose to the top of our gambling fraud wish list about two months ago. What he does has nothing to do with luck. It's definable ability. Look at him. He knows exactly what to do and not be caught. Can you explain that to me? No, I can't explain it, Callie, nor do I have the time. The Russian Federation has a 10-kiloton nuclear munition - unaccounted for. - I understand that. I'm not sure you do. We need every agent available beating the street. That bomb was stolen five weeks ago. We've just been informed of it now. Which means it could be parked under this truck for all we know. I need actionable intelligence, not paranormals and bullshit magicians. With all due respect, sir, this bullshit magician's shown a pattern of advanced awareness that is statistically impossible. You let me bring him in and you'll get what you want. Five days, Callie. That's it. Get me the head of casino security. - You Roybal? - It's Roybal. Whatever. - Who are you? - Cavanaugh. Take a walk. Hey, Roybal, this isn't a pissing contest. Come on. - What'd you do? You got a new car? - Stole it. Look at this. Twenty minutes to walk 20 steps. Well, that's what you get from two packs a day. Oh, hey. - I got you two sandwiches. - Two sandwiches? - That's 20 grand. - Take it. I love you. Oh, jeez. How can I repay you? Must be a bitch to park this thing. Chief Roybal. Special Agent Ferris. I'm sure Agent Cavanaugh has explained to you that everything you say is admissible in court and anything you knowingly admit can be used against you. Do we understand each other? Sure. - Tell me about Cris Johnson. - I don't know who that is. How about Frank Cadillac? You chased him out of your casino tonight. - He stole a car from valet parking. - Yeah, I know Cadillac. I thought he was cheating us at cards. Next thing I know, he's tackling some guy and waving a gun. The gun wasn't his. The man he tackled is wanted for two casino killings in Reno. He's in custody now. Come on, I want to show you something. You remember this? Oh, yeah, of course I do. We were saying he's looking right at us. - How'd you get this? - Think carefully. What were you talking about right when he looked up? We were saying, if he has a system, why isn't he betting more? You sure you weren't doing or saying anything else? I was going down to pick him up, I was reaching for my radio... And right then? That's when he looked up? Be very specific. That's what I said. He looked up, really. So he doesn't have to be there to do it. Once you enter his consciousness, he can pick it up. Is that to work his system? Thank you. We're finished. Done some good here, Mr. Roybal, but none of it is up for discussion. Now, as far as you're concerned, Cris Johnson never existed. That's going to be difficult considering 100 cameras saw him at the casino. Not to worry. Those tapes have been destroyed. Hey. Is she single? Cris, you can't keep stealing cars and having people chase you. That's not a life. But you got to forget this girl that you keep seeing in your head. I'm not going anywhere until I meet her. Well, suppose she don't show up? She already did, at the diner. 8:09. Well, you got a couple hours. How about a game of pool? All right, lrv. We'll shoot some pool. We timed every hand of blackjack. The longest was 89 seconds, when Johnson pulled a six-card 21. So we know he can see at least a minute and a half ahead. I had our techs run a radio frequency spectrum analysis. Came up dry, so he's not receiving any form of electronic help. At one point, there was a two-minute, 16-second delay. He never bet, just got up and walked away. Well, maybe 2:16's too long. He can't see that far. Narrows our window a little bit, anyway. Got him. Vegas P.D. got a LoJack hit on the stolen vehicle. Okay. Listen, about that girl. When you looked at the clock, did you happen to see a calendar? Because it could be 10 years from now she gets hungry. It's got to be soon. I've never seen further ahead than two minutes. Except for her. Now, what do you think the reason is for that? I don't know. Maybe she doesn't scare easy. Maybe she's the one. Well, when you get like this there's no talking to you. She's almost here. What happened to the diner? - Somebody else, a cop. - A cop? Well, then, you got to go. Hold on. I want to see how much she knows. What she wants from me. Cris Johnson. Still here, huh? Where else would I be? Special Agent Ferris. Next time, steal a car without LoJack. Can we speak privately? It's okay, lrv. Go ahead. Thanks. I'm sure you know why I'm here. Because you're the man who knows what I'm going to do before I do it, right? Oh, the show, right. Right! I saw you there. Wonderful. You like magic tricks. Yeah, yeah, I do like your magic tricks, clairvoyance... Whatever you're calling it. Let's talk about something hard. A stolen nuclear munition is being smuggled into the United States, or may, in fact, already be here. I want you to look ahead and tell me where it's going to be deployed. I think you've got the wrong guy. It's a magic act. You going to stick with that story? Because millions of lives are at risk and you could, maybe, prevent a major catastrophe. On a practical note, we're standing in front of a stolen vehicle and you are wanted for assault involving a weapon at the casino. All right, that was an accident. He had a gun. - He was going to shoot two people. - Yeah? How'd you know that? No good deed goes unpunished, does it? I can fix your legal problems, buddy, but you've got to step up. Otherwise, your next magic show is going to be at Folsom State Prison. It's ironic, but people like you who try to help have been torturing me, in the full sense of the word, since I was three years old. What did they call it? Oh, yeah. Observed play therapy. Featuring the marathon, 36-hour, can-you-guess-the-next-flash-card game. So, please, leave me alone and let me live some semblance of a normal life. I'd love to indulge your feelings, but I am dealing with a slightly larger picture right now. Now, you can exercise your responsibility to help your fellow man or I will exercise that responsibility for you. You're right. I got to go. He's gone, right? I missed him by seconds, didn't I? Excuse me, honey, can you get off my car? Yeah, thank you. Jeez. - Mr. Roybal? - It's Roybal. Can I help you, man? I have a few questions if this is a good time. Gaming Commission? It's after hours. You guys should be at a strip club, right? Come on. What can you tell us about Cris Johnson? I don't know who you're talking about. Let me rephrase the question. It's destiny. - Here you go, hon. - Thanks. Excuse me. Hello. I noticed you were alone, too. Do you mind if I join you? Actually, I do. Sorry to bother you, but I have a question about the coffee. The bean they use... isn't that something you should probably ask your waitress? Yes, it is. Excuse me, do you have a light? I don't smoke. - Here you go, hon. - Thanks. Please. Don't. Hey, Liz. Did you follow me here, Kendall? No! No, I just thought we could talk. You know, we got really nothing to talk about. And I told you that three weeks ago. Liz, come on, all right? I had an off day. Just give me another shot. It's not gonna happen. Okay? So maybe you should just go. Do you know how hard it was to find you? I was at your apartment. I tried the Starbucks on Lexington. I was at the dry cleaner. All I am asking for is a few minutes of your time so that we can work things out. - Okay, Jesus, you are stalking me now. - Don't! Don't say that, please. That's a terrible thing to say to somebody. Let go of me, Kendall. Look, I just... I thought we could talk, maybe we could take a drive. And now you are ruining it. You're hurting me. Kendall, I think you're having another off day. - Who the hell are you? - I'm her future. Really? Hi, my name's Cris. You okay, Kendall? See, the thing is, I feel connected to you. I don't know the reason why. - See, now, listen. - All right. I think it's only fair that you pay for the lady's breakfast. What are you having? Pecan pie is amazing. Excuse me, I can pay for my own breakfast. And you know what? You two work things out. Okay. You're hurting me. Kendall, I think you're having another off day. - Who the hell are you? - I'm her future. Really? Incoming. Did you see that? Goddamn it! Kendall! What? Don't blame me. This is your fault. Get out of here! Will somebody please call the cops? I am so sorry. Are you okay? Let me help you. Come on, let's get you cleaned up. Come on. Okay. Oh, yeah, I'm seeing some stars. Yeah. I'm Liz. Cris. You must have a death wish getting involved in that. Here. Just... - Okay. - Just... Okay, hold it there for a little bit. - Okay. - Yeah. It will. - What will? - Your luck. It's going to change. What are you? A leprechaun? Do leprechauns get punched in the face or have their car stolen? Your car was stolen? Yeah. I'm hoping they find it today. I'm supposed to be in Flagstaff. Hey, is this tooth loose here? I don't know. I don't think so. Hurts. Well, listen, maybe I could give you a ride, and I'm kind of going that way. That would really be helpful, Liz. Thank you. Well, I do have to make a stop, though. It's okay. And it might take a few hours, so if you're cool with that. Hey, look, if you're uncomfortable with this, - I'll take the bus. - No, no, no. It's fine, it's fine. You're not a psycho. Right? Because the first psycho vibe I get, you're out of the car. - Okay. Yes, ma'am. - Okay. Deal. It's amazing, isn't it? I end up in a diner where you are, and we're both headed in the same direction. I don't know if I would call it amazing, but... Destiny. That's what it really is. Okay, I'm starting to get that psycho vibe. Oh no. You don't believe in destiny? Well, even if it does exist, I don't think I want to know. I mean, if every move we make is preordained, then what is the point of that? I mean, life is supposed to be a surprise. Isn't it? It would be nice. Yeah. So he came in twice a day for a week at exactly 8:09? Yeah, he'd stay a few minutes, have a martini, and then he'd go. Till today, when he met that lady. You didn't find anything strange about that? Not strange enough to call the police. We got a regular that counts the corn flakes in his bowl because it has to be an even number. Got any cameras? Inside? No. Outside? No. Did you notice what kind of car he was driving? Maybe overhear where they were going? I don't know what car, but they were headed up to Flagstaff. - Flagstaff. - That's what they said. Got another regular, she's always on a diet. Brings in a scale and her own salad dressing. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Guy knows we're after him, but he still risks coming here. - 8:09, twice a day. - Doesn't even know if it's day or night. Just the time. He was waiting for her. All right, there's a traffic cam over there, a bank, a 7-Eleven across the street. Just run all the tapes. Maybe we'll get lucky and catch him in wide. Your buddy Roybal, the casino chief? Had his throat cut last night after getting a kneecap shot off. You're telling me this now? We just talked to him about Johnson. - Hey, I just found out. - All right. - Local weapon? - Dead end. And forensics came up empty. Not a hair, not a fiber. Somebody wants information. Now, the next time anything happens relative to Johnson, I want to know right away. I don't care if it's a paper cut. Okay, boss. That's good! Good. Right there! The head of casino security, what did you learn from him? For a macho guy, he screams like a girl. But he was questioned by federal agents looking for Cris Johnson, yes? He said they haven't found him yet. Do you believe this shit? He can see things before they happen? It makes no difference what I believe. Look, we spent two years setting this up and that man out there is worried all this will be compromised by Johnson. We're wasting our time looking for some magician. We're being paid to secure the operation, Jones, not to hunt down some carnival barker. Really? Then why are the same authorities that are looking for us so interested in him? Get rid of him. Do it now. Hey. Havasupai Reservation. I teach here once a week. The conditions are pretty lousy. But it's in the Canyon, one of the Eight Wonders of the World. - Hey, Sam. - Hey, Liz. Well, a couple hundred years ago, this tribe was booming. Plenty of food and a thriving culture. They should be better off. But I guess this was just their destiny. I'd like to meet their shaman. I read once that in many North American tribes their shaman's purpose wasn't only healing but they also claimed to have power over the atmosphere. To bring on or stop rain. Even know future events. Do you think that's possible? Well, I believe anything is possible. Me, too. - Whose birthday? - One of my students'. Hey! Hi! How's it going? Hello! How is everybody? Good? - That's good. - Oh, I was close. That was a lot. You messed up on the last part. On the last part. Yeah. I thought you weren't coming back until next Monday. Well, I'm not, but it's Jake's birthday. How could I miss that? Who's that man you're with? Is he your boyfriend? No, no, he's not my boyfriend. He's just my friend. I think he likes you. Well, why would you say that? Because he looked at you like my brother looks at his girlfriend. Hey, Jake, you want to see some magic? I'll show you something. Come here. I found this rock out in the Canyon and I want you to hold it because it's a magic rock. That's right. Hold it really tight. Keep squeezing. It's magic. He won't bite. Happy birthday. So, you're a magician? Well... I have a small magic act back in Vegas. The Frank Cadillac Show. - I thought your name was Cris. - It is. Frank Cadillac is my stage name. How did you come up with that? I picked two things I really liked and I put them together. Frankenstein and Cadillacs. You are odd. Charming, but odd. Cease fire! Visitor on the range! Nice. A little close, though. Okay. You were right about the traffic cam. We got a positive lD. I'm sorry. Don't be. It's okay. Did I drool? - Drool? - Yeah. Drool? No. Oh, my God, it's coming down so hard. Yeah. I like rain. I like rain, too. You know, once, I think it was in Denmark, it rained fish. Because the sun dehydrated the water and took it up into the atmosphere, rehydrated the fish eggs and they hatched and it rained fish. Is that true? Yeah, in the clouds. True story. It happened 50 years ago. I just felt like sharing that with you. Road's washed out ahead. You can't cross till morning. Not even then if this keeps up. You want to spin around and go back about two miles, take your second left. There'll be a motel there called... "The Cliffhanger." Thanks. Right. Him, right? That's it? There's no front plate. Where's the other side? I don't have it. What was that on the front window? Go back. Back, back. Back. There! Zoom in. That's a permit. Track it and find her. I'll light a fire. Cris, one little problem. Oh, no, no, I'm going to sleep in the car. Okay. Here. - Thanks. - Sure. Hey, did you hear the joke about the Zen master who ordered the hot dog? No. He said he'd have one with everything. Good night. What do we have? They're at the Cliffhanger Motel outside Flagstaff. We found an Arizona DOT foreman who remembered the Land Cruiser. Why would he do that? The road was flooded. He was about to suggest a place to stay. But Johnson already knew. Right? Exactly. Callie. It just got worse. All right, people, we've got a nuclear alert. Code Red, in the Southern California region. L.A. to San Diego. 95% certainty. Nuclear emergency search teams are on the way, but until they get here, can somebody please tell me what my agency, the FBI, is doing about it? Sir, tier-one suspects have been interrogated. Cars and premises have been checked, friends and acquaintances. We've opened up surveillance on tier-two and three suspects, but nothing actionable yet. Oh, is that what we're doing, waiting for something actionable? There are eight million lives that are precarious at best. I say we widen the net to "slightly suspicious" and get some decent intel before this nuke blows up Los Angeles. All right, Callie. What do you propose we do next? I believe that the urgency of this situation compels the use of any and all resources to obtain Cris Johnson. We know where he is. Let my team pick him up. He said they're mobilizing. Standard procedure when security is escalated. Tell him to wrap it up. They'll lead us straight to Johnson. You hungry? There's a coffee shop down the road. I'd rather eat here, if that's okay. Sure. What? There's an ltalian painter named Carlotti, and he defined beauty. He said it was the summation of the parts working together in such a way that nothing needed to be added, taken away or altered. That's you. You're beautiful. Wow. That was incredible. What was? This. Right here gives us a good standoff position and open view of the front of the motel. We can run multiple point and area surveillances from this road here, that turn out. Get a team with a parabolic set right here. That's fine, but I also want mobile surveillance. And give me two or three roamers. If he rabbits on us, I want to be flexible. Ferris. Call the local police in Flagstaff. Tell them to hold the outside perimeter. I want that area locked down. A body turned up in an apartment with a line of sight to my office. Slit throat, like Roybal. Somebody's trying to follow us to Johnson. Cris. Yeah. Maybe there is such a thing as destiny. Give it 40 seconds. So, after two minutes, he just stops seeing what's going to happen? I sure as hell hope so. Elizabeth Cooper? - Yeah. - Federal Agent Ferris. What is this about? I'm going to need a few minutes of your time. Yeah, okay. They're putting her in the car. Drop the gun! Step back. It's his gun. He was going to shoot two people! This was three days ago? He used you to get away from us in Vegas. You can be pretty sure that everything he told you is a lie. He's delusional. A sociopath. Oh, my God. Oh, shit. Go back to the motel. Have a drink. Put one of these in his glass. It'll take five minutes to put him to sleep. Then we'll come in and get him. Nobody's been hurt. But this is important. You need to do it at least two minutes after you get him out of the room. Why do you need me? Why can't you just get him? Liz, as I understand it, you work for a federally funded program teaching on various reservations. Is that true? Yes, that's true. Well, I'd think you'd be eager to help us. We're on the same team. Now they're letting her go. Hey. Thanks for the note. Sure. - Did you have a nice walk? - I did. You know, it's really beautiful here. I have a present for you. Oh, thanks. - I need that. - Yeah. Is something wrong? Oh, no, no, I'm fine. Why don't you go wash up and I'm gonna make us breakfast? - Okay. - Okay. 45 seconds. One minute, thirty. And that's two. - Looks good. - You think so? Thank you. Don't drink that! It's drugged. Oh, God, I don't know what I'm doing. I have no idea what I'm doing. Some federal agent came up to me and said that you were a delusional sociopath and showed me this tape. So maybe you are. But I don't want to believe that. I don't think I can believe that. And she also said that if you ran, they would shoot you. So I should drug you instead. Even if what they said is true, I don't want you to die. I don't want you to die. Cris, is it true? Oh, shit. Wow! Get me broadband noise reduction. I don't like hearing this! Speak quietly and act normally. How long did they say the drugs would take? About five minutes. A nice inside kick. Wow! What is he doing? He's drinking. Give it a minute. Got a clean shot? Not yet. The man in that casino would have killed two people. It happened. It just hadn't happened yet. Oh, my God, you are delusional. Fluffy cranberry or a stack of chocolate chip pancakes for the kids. Fluffy cranberry or a stack of chocolate chip pancakes for the kids in an instant. Safe? Who knows what's safe? I knew a man who dropped dead from looking at his wife. Safe? Who knows what's safe? I knew a man dropped dead from looking at his wife. You can't get lost in the woods if you never go into the woods. You can't get lost in the woods if you never go into the woods. That's right, sir. You're the only person authorized to do so. That's right, sir. You are the only person authorized to do so. How are you doing this? I have no idea how, but I can. I was born with it. Is this some kind of a trick? You know we don't have time for that. You said anything was possible. So, you see things before they happen? You see the future? My future. What'll affect me, and only two minutes ahead. Except you. For some reason, I saw you. For some reason, I saw you far beyond anything I'd ever seen before and I don't know why. What do you mean, you saw me? You've been... You've been doing that to me? You know what I'm going to do and what I'm going to say? That you've just been setting me up? No, I haven't. I wanted to find you because I needed to know why I was seeing you. And because l... It wasn't a setup. What do they want from you? They think I can help them in matters of national security. Call code is received. The normal SSB radios in the aircraft... I don't understand. If you can help, then why don't you? Because I can't. I can only give them a two-minute head start. And that's if my life is personally involved. But with me, you can see further. Yeah. But they don't know that. There's almost $10,000 in this envelope. They know about you. You need to get away from here. What time do you have? 9:10. Set your watch to 9:17. Read this when I leave and wait exactly 45 seconds before you do what it says. I'll take Ferris with me. It might be a week or a month, but if you can wait, I'll find you. And yes, gentlemen, they are on their way and no one can bring them back. Something's wrong. Don't do it. I already have. Go get him! Alive! Let's go! Bitch! Come on! Are you crazy? Oh, shit! Watch out! Get down! Johnson. You know you're not going to shoot. You going to let me die? Hey, I need some help! Let's get him out of here! - Let's get him out of here. - I got him. You all right? You okay? Open your eyes. Look at me. No good deed goes unpunished, does it? She got him. Now what? You see her? Smoke? Thanks for today. Could've let me die. I appreciate it. That was a real show of character. I know I seem like the bad guy in all this, but in the interests of preserving our freedom there are larger issues at play. What about my freedom? With freedom comes responsibility. I have rights. This isn't about you. This is about eight million other people. If I do what you want, you'll keep me in this chair forever. There is a nuclear bomb somewhere in Los Angeles. And every television station in the world will broadcast the precise details of its detonation. So, go on, push that two minutes as far as you can and find it. The system, which is still just a tropical storm, is picking up steam and heading for the U.S. Experts fear this storm has a good chance of growing to an F3 status before making landfall. More worrisome, though, is the strong possibility that it could travel through what is known as Hurricane Alley into the Gulf of Mexico. The warm Gulf waters would cause the storm to intensify quickly. Evacuation plans are already in place... broadcast this afternoon for breaking news out of downtown Los Angeles. Largest technology corporations oppose this idea, and tech lobbying is blamed for stalling the proposal... members of the LAPD bomb squad are staging in that area. We go live now to reporter Lisa Joyner at the scene for the very latest. Lisa. Jeff, the standoff began when police received an anonymous phone call stating that explosives would be detonated at this parking garage at 2nd and Broadway at 6:00 tonight. There's no... They have no idea on a motive. The victim, however... Liz, I'm sorry. What? What did you say? The LAPD has surrounded the area. They've secured a perimeter. But now the bomb squad is making their way onto the deck of this building. And they're the men that are walking up with black suits on and such. Oh, my God. There's been... There's been an explosion. There's been an explosion... Oh, my God. The victim has been identified as Elizabeth Cooper of Las Vegas. She was strapped to a wheelchair. Sorry. Approximately 10% of U.S. workers receive stock options. Many technology companies give the options away... - Tell me what just happened. - Yeah, I can't. It won't work like this. Get me out of this room and I'll do what you want. I beg you, please get me out of this room. Let him out! - Callie! Callie, wait up. - What? Forensics report on Betty Peterson. The dead girl in the apartment? Her throat was cut, bled out. Otherwise, nothing to DNA. The place was immaculate again. How'd it go with Johnson? Well, something happened, but he's not sharing. You know, there are traces of potassium iodide. Some medication Peterson was taking? - They found an empty pillbox. - No. The only reason to take it is to prevent radiation poisoning. Hey, wait, can I get a smoke or something? I need to relax. Thanks. Hey, can I get a light? Look at this. Look. Ta-da! Get it up here! Let's go! Base, Air 1. Base, Air 1. I've got visual. Subject is spotted heading south on 5th Street. Be advised, subject is turning east onto Broadway. Stay here. Let me deal with this. Why are you here? They killed her. Two hours from now. They killed Liz. Tell me what you saw. I saw them execute her. Right there. On the roof. It hasn't happened yet and I know who has her. It's the same people we're after. There's a reason that they brought you here. They're using Liz as bait. 10-1 you go out on that roof, they're going to put a bullet in your brain. I know. Right now, she's still alive. She is, you are, we all are. Let's try to keep it that way. I help you, you help me, all right? I want a two-mile radius. Every telephone grid, shortwave, cell tower. Shut it down. What do you want me to do? Let him shoot you. Your call cannot be completed as dialed. Check the number and dial again. Your call cannot be completed as dialed. FBI! Down on your knees! You okay? That looked pretty close. Sleight of hand. - You didn't get him. - Not alive. He fired on the chopper. But it doesn't matter. He couldn't call in the hit. So as far as they're concerned, you're not here yet. It buys us time. Every way I try this, she still ends up dead. What if you do it earlier? They have to bring her here in a vehicle, right? - Looking for a license plate. - Right. Can you see it? It helps if you don't speak right now. California plate number 50KF272. California tag. 5, 0, kilo, foxtrot, 2, 7, 2. Please, where are you taking me? What do you want with me? Who the hell are you people? SITREP, Cavanaugh. Local SWAT has been deployed and the regional team just showed to back us up. All right, listen up. A van carrying Elizabeth Cooper will exit the warehouse across from Pier 18 compound in approximately five minutes. Four minutes and 27 seconds. - Do you mind? - Not anymore. Go ahead. They've got her wrapped in explosives, wired to a cell phone. Remote trigger. Another cell phone sets it off. Usually a one-button speed dial. They'll take this route to the entrance gate. At that point, Alpha and Bravo will swarm the entrance... if you could just be quiet and do exactly what I say, I'll save your life. We need to stop the vehicle here before they get through the gates. Alpha and Bravo will hold and contain here. Sniper teams will initiate on Johnson's call. On his call. Are we clear? All elements shoot to kill any hostiles. What about intel? We don't need them. We have him. All right, everybody! Let's go! Move out! Let's go! Go! Let's go! Move! Back up! Back up! Back up! Go, go, go! - Stop the van. - Not yet. You'll kill her. Now. You're good to go! Now, now! This is Charlie 1 on approach, east side of building. Move back! Move back! This is Alpha Unit, Alpha-U! We're taking fire! Take out the guy on the crane, northeast corner. - Negative on a visual. - Give me that. Aim for the doorway, eight inches above the guardrail. On me, let's go! Zed David, Charlie 1 at entry point. Turn right. You're clear. You're good! Go! Go! Come on! Let's go! Number 2 loading dock. Repeat. Number 2 loading dock. Stop. No! Go. This is Charlie 1 element, moving and clearing, over. Thanks. There are explosives there, there and there. Stay close. - Sniper. - Where? - Behind us. - Sniper, six o'clock. - Got a visual? - Nobody move! I'll find him. Catwalk, second level. Catwalk, six o'clock. Second level. Got him. We'll have to clear this deck by deck. You take this one. I'll do the rest. Let's sweep and clear. She's near the engine room. Come on, man. Release the hostage. You can still get out of this. Don't patronize me. How good are you with that gun? Very. You're going to be okay, Liz. Back off! I've seen every possible ending here. None of them are good for you. I'll take my chances. One more step, fortune teller, and it definitely won't be good for you. You have one way out of this. That wasn't it. Liz, look at me. It's okay. Look at me. It's over. It's over. No, it's not. The nuclear device was moved. We need to find its exact location. Now, this registers any significant detonation in the earth's crust. Take a look. Tell me what you see. Something's wrong. I made a mistake. What? I made a mistake. - It's happening. - When? Now! All right, I got four teams in place. We're just waiting on the road crew. All right. - Ferris. - It's me. I'll do it, but I have conditions. I want her left out of it. I'm sure we can work something out. Liz? Hey. Come back to bed. I got to go. Go where? There's something I have to do. I can't put it off any longer. Are you coming back? Yeah. It may be a week or a month. But if you can wait, I'll find you. Here's the thing about the future. Every time you look at it, it changes because you looked at it. And that changes everything else. You ready? Yeah.
