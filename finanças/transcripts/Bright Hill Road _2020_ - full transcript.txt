Marcy. Oh my god. Three million dollar drug smuggling ring. 22 pounds of heroin was seized, along with a small amount of cocaine, marijuana, and ecstasy. Police say the ring was centered in Columbia, with drugs spiking away in large city centers. 25 people have been arrested and face charges. Marcy. Harvey's left six messages already, and he said he emailed you. He's probably freaking me out. - Who? - Harvey. He, you fired him on Friday. Okay, I'll deal with it. Should I call head office or the police? Yeah, I'll deal with it. Do you need to go home? We're downtown. It's a man, his name's Harvey, he used to work here. Marcy, Marcy! No! No, no, wait! Take a guess. Hey! Guess. Can somebody help! Help! Help! 323 to 584. Marcy fired him on Friday. His name's Harvey. When he came in today, I just, I don't know, I have so much going on. And then he started going from office to office, and I heard bang, bang. And then he went into the bathroom, and I don't, I was trying to get Marcy. Pure dereliction. And your secretary said you were drunk on top of it. Help! Take some time. Sort yourself out, Marcy. When you get yourself together we'll talk about your future. Help! Hey, don't worry about any of that. We just wanna see you. Just come here. Hey, don't worry about any of that. We just wanna see you. Just come here. Are you all right? Lucky for you we have an empty house. How long do you think you'll stay? Few days, maybe. Of course. Sign right here, please. Marcy. Pretty name. This building is quite old. It's been many things over the years, a hospital, a hotel, a bar. What happened here? One of the owners was shot. Bright Hill Road has a long and complicated history, as many of the older houses do. The bathroom is shared. Like the kitchen, keep it tidy. Be respectful of your neighbors' needs. No noise after 11, no overnight guests unless they are paying guests. No cooking in your room. It saves on dusting. A mirror is the window to the soul. It's the eyes. The eyes are the window to the soul. Hm. Perhaps you're right. I would be happy to get your bags from your car. Oh. Thank you. It's in my trunk. You rest now. One. Happy new year. It's Mia, you know what to do. Mia, it's me. Don't worry, you can pick up, I'm not drunk dialing. You know, there's a crucifix on the closet where I'm staying, Dad would approve. I made a new thing. Do you remember the photo of us in front of the old house? The one of you, me, Dad. It's that. Fucked up pretty bad. Maybe you heard, I don't know. But I think I'm gonna come stay with you for a few days. A few weeks, maybe. Hope that's okay. You can shove it. Okay? I'm quitting drinking. Gonna quit mucking it up for good. And you can shove it. And you can shove it. Everyone can shove it. Well, I guess I will see you soon. You might wanna hide the matches. Mia? Hello? No, no, no, you can't go in there, your father's in there. It's okay. He died in a fire. Good morning. Morning. There's some tea and coffee on the table, help yourself. Everything all right? Everything's fine. Mrs. Inman? Hello? Good evening, Marcy. Did you need something? No, no, I was just feeling a little claustrophobic, so I thought I'd come see if there was something to read. Oh, be my guest. If you'll excuse me then. Mrs. Inman? Marcy. Get me a beer. My daughter, the godless little bitch. Nope. You weren't there. You are with God, old man. I'm not you. Blow out the candle. Mia. Mia, oh. I'm sick. I know. What, I know. You didn't call me back. I'm waiting for you here, Marcy. I'm waiting for you here. I know, I'm sick. I have the flu. I have Dad's flu. Go away! Leave me alone, I'm sick. Please let me in, I'm sick, I have the flu! Marcy. Let me in, let me in! Marcy. It was an accident, I'm sorry. I've heard it all before. I've seen it all before, too. I had a husband who used to drink. It's been a difficult few weeks. Drink up slowly, your stomach is still raw. Better in than out. I think your house is haunted. Is it? Oh. Well, you're looking brighter. You know, I don't think you're in any shape to go anywhere. I hope you're not intending to leave. It's just a hangover. My sister is expecting me. It's not a hangover, dear. What's your experiencing is withdrawal, it can be quite serious. Trust me, I know from experience. Look, I don't know what you think you know... I'm not a fancy shrink, but I can tell you that everyone reaches a point where they have to reevaluate. It's part of the human condition. There's no shame in it. You know, I don't think I properly thanked you for last night. I know a woman in crisis when I see one. You know, I hope you can feel that you can talk to me. I'm very discreet. Everyone who comes here has a secret. I'm fine. Unburdening cleanses the soul. Why do you care so much? Because we're all in this together, aren't we? I'm a good listener. Noted. Thank you. Oh, there's stacks of old magazines in the basement if you're interested. Don't mind the mess, accumulation of lifetimes. Are you going somewhere? I just need some air. I don't think I recommend that, Marcy. I'll be back soon. That man was drunk, you weren't there, you didn't see it! Drunk in the middle of the day, driving a car, does that seem unlikely to you? You're upset for the same reasons that brought you here, Marcy. I am here because I am on my way to California to visit my sister. I know. Oh, you've had a very hard time, Marcy. With your sister and your father and the fire. How do you know anything... You left your art things lying about. Come here, sweetheart, tell me about the fire. It was an accident. And did you cause this accident? I think it's time for me to leave. Marcy. Marcy! It's Mia, you know what to do. Hey, it's me. I don't know if you'll get this, reception is terrible here, but I'm coming. I'll see you in a day or so. Okay. I'm sorry to see you go. Are you sure you're up for it? I'd just like to check out, please. You don't look well. You know, quitting cold turkey can be quite damaging. Thank you for your concern. Key. I hope your stay was fruitful in some way. Thank you. Marcy! Come back inside! You need to rest. Too much at once. You can't come with me. You need to get out. Just drive the car, Marcy. You can't tell me what to do anymore. You're not God. God is not the problem. No. I got him with me right here. I didn't shoot that gun. I didn't light that fire, it was an accident, you know that. You were there, you were both there. Your sister tells a different story, doesn't she? I love my sister. The mirror is the window to the soul. You got a car coming, don't muck it up. Hello? Is someone there? Get lost! Boo! What the hell are you doing? Nothing. I was just having a little bit of fun. Didn't you watch horror movies when you were a kid? - No. - Oh. Should have. Anyway, I'm here, too. That's me right down the hall. I'm Owen, and we're neighbors. Okay. What were you doing outside my door, Owen? That's the thing, you know the lady who runs the joint, she says we're the only two people here. That's kinda weird. So I thought we should meet. So hi. You don't look so well. Are you okay? I've had a cold. Oh. Yeah, you gotta stay on top of your health. They say you only got one life before. You know? Yeah. I think I'm gonna hit the hay. It was nice to meet you... - Marcy. - Marcy. That's a very pretty name. You look awfully familiar. No I don't. Stay the fuck away from my door. I met the new tenant last night. He was hanging around outside my door. He was purposely trying to scare me. Really? Yes, he tried to come in my room. Perhaps he mistook it for his. I'm sure it won't happen again. No, it wasn't a mistake. It wasn't a mistake! Well, we get all kinds here, Marcy, so many kinds of people. Good, bad, some famous, too, although I'm not supposed to tell you that. Famous? Oh, perhaps notorious is a better word. But privacy is important. Everybody's on their own journey. People don't like it known that they've stayed in a boarding house, there's an element of sordid to it. Really? Not you, of course, but let's see. Well, without naming names. There is a woman who stayed here some time ago. She was an angry, bitter, miserable woman. She felt like the whole world was against her, but really it was the fault of her no-good drunken husband. He owned this place for some time. Anyway, she shot him. In the stairwell? Was that you? Bright Hill Road has been a way station for all kinds of people. And some of these people are doing penance for their sins, no names. And the new tenant, is he murderous? Bright Hill Road does not pry or judge. Good morning, Marcy. Are you still mad at me? Look, we're the only two people here. It's gonna make the hallway awkward. And the kitchen, and the bathroom. It wasn't funny. Don't do it again. Witch's honor. "Bewitched"? So how long you gonna be here anyway? I'm leaving today. Today, I just got here. Have you stayed here before? Nope, why, is it haunted, bedbugs, what? No, more like mold or asbestos or something. Gross. Yeah. God, you look familiar. Where you from? You don't know me. Maybe. Or maybe I'm just thinking of a time in my life when I had a real type. And maybe that type was you, Marcy. Hi. But I'm a good boy now. I don't do that stuff anymore. Pleasant morning. You'll catch your death if you go out there without a coat. I'm going to California. Are you sure you're ready to leave? Yes. My sister's waiting for me. Have you ever had this place inspected for mold or asbestos? Or is there some sort of a coal plant nearby? Your system is adjusting to being denied alcohol. I'm not an alcoholic. Your hands are shaking. I suspect you have headaches. In a few hours you'll be at risk of seizure. Are you hearing anything or seeing anything? My husband was a drunk, remember, I know how this works. I'm just tired. Well. A nap is a little gift we give ourselves. I'll bring this up. Okay. Did you make this and put it in my room? No. I'm not much of an artist. I didn't make it. Are you sure? Perhaps you made it while you were under the weather. I didn't make it, which means Owen has been in my room. This has got to stop. Okay, I think you're jumping to conclusions. There's no other explanation! Pretty sure I heard my name. You were in my room. No I wasn't. Did you make this? No. Yes you did! One of you made this, and you put it in my portfolio, in my room! - You're a liar! - Marcy! That is enough, calm yourself. Nope. It's Mia, you know what to do. Hey, it's me. I really wish you'd call me back. Everything's really fucked up right now, and I kinda feel like I'm losing it. You always know what to do. And I know, I know what you're thinking, but I haven't had a drink in days. I mean, I don't even know how long. I could really use one. Hey, Dad was in my dream last night. It was so crazy. Please call me. Hi. Hi. Peace offering. It's not Passover. Do you really care? So anyway, I was thinking about checking out the metropolis. I think you should join me. - You scare me. - You still scare me too. So if you come with me, I'll tell you my life story. Come on. Hey, you okay? Yeah, yeah. So far, I guess. Okay. Well I won't bite. Let's go. It's fucking cold. Come on. Why did you move around so much? My dad, he was one of those guys that was kinda bad at everything. Yeah. He would get fired for punching out the boss, and he'd get thrown in jail for doing some other bad thing, and then he'd get fired for that. My mom, she was ashamed, so we just kept moving on. - Man, that's brutal. - Mm-hm. Why are you going back, then? Where? Home. Home, well, home is where you go where they have to let you back in. And I'm not allowed to go back to a lot of places. How about you, what's your story? And why do you look so damn familiar? Do you do porn? - Fuck off. - You do porn. I'm kidding. So where you going? I'm going to California to see my sister. California, is she a movie star? No. Did you hear something last night in one of the rooms? Like what? I don't know, a person crying. Nope. Oh, check that out. Lot of bored women in a town like this. Oh my god, there is something wrong with her. Nah, she's just wasted. Well, should we try and stop her? Should we call someone or something? No. Use a phone around here, there's not a cell phone tower in miles. Look out! You see that? Oh my god. What's wrong? The driver. You're okay, it's okay, that car missed us by a mile. The, the driver... That was fucked up. - Wait. - What? What? - What's wrong? - This has happened before. What's happened before? The car that almost hit us, that same thing happened to me earlier. The same car? No, a different car, but the same thing. There's a lot of bad drivers in this town. No, there's... This place, okay, this whole, whole place is something... Something's not right. But I can't seem to get it together to leave. Okay, all right, calm down. Don't be so serious. It's no fun. Compartmentalize. My dad used to say, he used to say, "Ignore the voices in your head until you need them." All right, try that. Nope. Let me out of here! Please! I'm coming. Hello? Hey, hey! Are you okay? Oh my god, is somebody there? - Can I help you? - No! Help me! Please! I have to get out of here! Help me! He's trying to kill me, he's trying to kill me! No, let her out! Let her out! You piece of shit, let me out! Mrs. Inman! Mrs. Inman, who is in 15? Who is in 15? It's not possible. Tiny gaps in the paint, water through the pipes, wood and concrete shifting with the temperature. What you heard was eternity winding its way through the walls. I didn't just hear crying. I saw her. She grabbed me. Well, it can sound like crying. Just like that, huh? To whatever the fuck is going on. - Mia. - Number you have reached is not in service at this time. The number you have reached is not - in service at this time. - You called me. You called, you fucking called me! Fuck, no, stop it! Marcy. What on earth is going on? What is going on, Mrs. Inman, what? Look to your own self, Marcy. I think all your troubles stem from your inability to see things as they really are. As they really are? Nothing in this place is real! Oh, that's where you're mistaken. And what are your mistakes? You should be examined. Was it an accident? Or did you muck it up? What the fuck did you just say to me? Who told you to say that? How dare you, didn't you shoot your husband? How can you judge me? I'm not your judge. And I'm doing penance for that, I'm working it off as we speak. What, what, what are you talking about? Oh Marcy, I think you should go up to your room right now. Is there a house phone here? Heavens no. I have so much to do, you're not the only guest, you know. You know what? All right, you win. I guess that's for me, huh? Thank you. Please help me! Marcy? Look at me, look at my, am I bleeding? No, no, no, no, nothing, nothing, you're fine. You're fine. You're fine, okay? All right. You need to sit down, okay? Here, come in my room. Shit. Have a seat. Sit. You okay? Just one. You okay? What do you need? You need something? I know what you need, here. Take this. Take it. It'll ground you. That's right. There you go. Now tell me what happened. I had, okay. I was in the bath. You were in the bath. And I saw my reflection in a mirror, and I was... I, I had bruises all, all over me, and I was bleeding. - Bleeding? - I looked like... Okay, okay, just calm down. You were hallucinating. That's all. I mean, you were hitting the bottle pretty hard. I saw you come upstairs with a box of wine. You just drank too much. No, no, no, it's not like that. I have had things that are happening to me, it keeps happening to me, and I don't know what's real anymore. Okay. It's okay. It's okay. You're okay. You just have to watch the brews. I try. I have tried. Uh huh. It's like there's a different person inside me. She's relentless. She just wants to drink. I can't shut her up. Well, that's how it works. Maybe we all have two people walking around inside of us, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. She is person one? Sometimes. Sometimes it goes the other way, too. Right? I should go. No, you should stay. You know, I was thinking, you know what you were saying before? About, what did you say? Other self, how people have two people inside of them? I think you can get rid of that. It just takes willpower, yeah. You know, mastery. I gotta tell you, I know a lot about mastery. I don't wanna be alone. I don't wanna be alone, because when I'm alone, I hear things, too, inside my head. Do you hear the woman? The crying woman? Yeah, yeah, you hear her, too? I thought I was going crazy, holy shit. - Yeah, she's real. - No, no, she's not. I talked to Mrs. Inman, I told her what was going on. She showed me the room, it's fucking empty. Well, she's in another room. No. No, it's next door. But I heard her. I heard banging. She was banging. - Wait, what? - Bang, bang, bang! You know, she was, I heard her, you know? Not here, but before, and I didn't hear her at first. But she was banging, and then she was screaming. I don't know what you're talking about. Something happened and I can't remember. And I don't wanna be alone. I just, it always happens when I'm alone. I hear the sounds only when I'm alone, like you. You only hear it when you're alone, right? That makes us the same. We're the same. So please don't go. Will you, will you stay? Yeah, will you stay? Yeah. I'm glad you stayed. Glad you stayed. Mm-hm, say it. I'm glad you stayed. Yeah, I'm glad I stayed. What, what? Don't! Get off. Get off! Get off, stop! Don't, don't, don't! Please stop, Owen! Owen! Marcy! Marcy, talk to me! Please come back, huh? Leave me alone! What are you doing in there, huh? Don't you fucking call her, okay? Please? What, what are you talking about? That bitch Inman, look, just leave that fucking bitch out of this, please. Why would you call her that? Because she fucking pries! She presses, she tries to get in my fucking head, she's making me go fucking crazy, Marcy! Hey. Hey Marcy, why don't you come back to my room, huh? I'm working on this experiment, and I'm finding my true self. You know, and I need your help. Please? What kind of experiment? I wanna see how long I can last with a woman without killing her. Don't cry. Marcy, open the fucking door! Open it! Look, I didn't even fucking kill you, did I, huh? I didn't even fucking kill this bitch that's in the trunk! Okay, she's still alive, she's still breathing, right? 911, what's your emergency? Hi, hi, there's somebody trying to break into my room, can you please come? It's a man, he's dangerous. Fuck you. What is your emergency? I just told you, there's somebody trying to break into my room. He has a history, he's a criminal. Is this an emergency or a problem that you've caused for yourself? What? So much of what's happened to you was preventable, Marcy. Who is this? Harvey, for instance. Threatened you and your office the day you fired him. He said he thought about coming back with a gun and showing you what was important. He told you that. I didn't know that that's what he was going to do. You were drunk, though. You started the fire, you ran away from that. Okay, I don't wanna talk about that right now. You were drunk, you started the fire, you ran away. I must have kicked a candle over when I was asleep. It's an accident, these things happen to everybody. And the shooting? Was that an accident? And the car wreck? Could that have been prevented? Stop it! You've been irresponsible and negligent, and it's led to great disaster. It's broken my heart. Mia? It's time to face yourself. The mirror is a window to the soul. That's not how that saying goes. Mia... You were a godless child, just like me. And you shall celebrate with the bounty your father gave you. That's Deuteronomy. You can't stop me. Hey! Let me out of here! I don't know what to do. You will keep coming back until you assume your culpability, Marcy. I left my house and I got in the car. Drunk, I'm always drunk. And I went to work. Harvey. Harvey. I knew it. All those people. Mia. Oh my god. Mia, I'm so sorry. And Dad, too. They were all my fault. All of them, all of it. It's all me. And you, you were in the other car. You were driving the other car. With a guest in his trunk. It was the one life you saved, Marcy, your one good deed. The crying woman. Hell couldn't wait any longer. Are you ready? I'm ready. Mia. Welcome.
