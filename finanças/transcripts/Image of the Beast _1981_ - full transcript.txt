(foreboding electronic music) (computer keys clacking) - [Man] Hey Kathy, look at this. - Are you still at Computers, Incorporated, Kathy? - Mm, still there. - When's your due date? - Oh, three long weeks. - You'll make it. - Oh it's easy for you to say. - Are you sure you want this book? - It's about computers, isn't it? - It's a religious book about people who worship computers. One of the stock boys read it, though. He said it was really scary. - Good, you have to scare some people just to get their attention. Should we allow these people to find themselves in the tribulation period, scared to death? Or get their attention now while something can be done? - Like what? - Receiving Christ. - Well, I'll read the book, honey. Like you, Patty, I just find all this prophecy stuff to be a little hard to believe. - You know, unless you gals open your minds and your hearts, I'm afraid one of these days, you're gonna be in for a rude awakening. (woman screaming) - Annie, you betrayed us! You belong in a bottomless pit in hell. You're not even human! Annie, I don't wanna be here. Please, I don't wanna be here, please help me. - Patty, we don't want you to be here either. My sister just threw her life away for a God that doesn't even exist. This life is real, Patty, can't you see? That guillotine is real. Please take the mark, Patty, please. Take the mark, please. (Patty screaming) (thunder cracks) - Patty Jo Meyers, do you wish to renounced your faith in your God and receive your identification, either in your right hand or in your forehead, as set forth by Brother Christopher in Article 1-7A? If so, answer I do, and you will be returned to your rightful place in society. (Patty screaming) (thunder rumbling) (thunder cracks) - I want the mark. I want the mark, I want the mark! Save me! No! (gasps) Oh please, somebody help me. Oh please, Sandy! No! No! No! (suspenseful music) (Patty crying) (lock rattling) - Oh! No! (metal creaking) (mob shouting in the distance) (mouse squeaking) (woman screams) - Come on out of there. Hold out your hands. I said hold out your hands, now. Do it! Praise God. - You mean you're not? - Praise God is right! - Not so loud. (sirens wailing) (distant explosions) - How'd you get that uniform? - Somewhere up there, ladies, lies a soldier in the mud. His only earthly possessions being his government-issued underwear and his EFT code on his right hand. - Did you kill him? - I'm not sure. If I did it was, it was self-defense. Hey, cowboy, what's your name? - Billy. - Billy? Well that's a nice name. How old are you, Billy? Three. I had a son. He was, just over a year when Christ returned and took the Christians in the rapture. I lost both he and his brother. - My husband was a Christian. Five days after he disappeared, Billy was born. - Momma, I have to bathroom. - Are you frightened? - Yeah, I guess I am. - We shouldn't be, should we? - We do need to put our trust in Jesus. But the anxiety of what's going to happen to us, how, when, is pretty natural. - What are you thinking? - Oh (laughs). I was just wondering what would have happened if we'd met in another time. - I wish we had. - About the only benefit to being a believer these days is where we go if they win. - What if one were not a believer? - My advice to that person would be to stay alive as long as possible. - Then you gotta get us out of here. - Oh, I'm sure gonna try. - I thought I was a Christian. - I thought I was too. - After the Christians disappeared, life just went on. There wasn't much different at first. But then... I'm afraid, I don't know why we're here. - I know how you feel, the same thing happened to me. But you wanna know something? I'm not afraid anymore. Two years ago, I had a unique experience with God. He revealed to me the reason why I'm still here, and that he's still continuing the work that began in me before the rapture. - You know why you're still here? - Yes, I do, but it was very painful for me when I discovered that I was truly sincere about my beliefs but I was sincerely wrong. - But I went to church, I even taught Sunday school. - I know, I worked with handicapped kids, and all that's all right, but when we say I, I did this and I did that, like I did, well, it only proves that we left out the only thing that really matters. - What's that? - Jesus Christ. - You and I and million of others just like us tried to work our way to heaven our way. - Jesus said in John 14:6, I am the way, the truth, and the life, and no man cometh to the father but by me. - The Bible says it's a gift. - What's a gift? - Eternal life. - I'm curious, if you're not a believer, why haven't you taken the mark? - Computer Prophecies, hm. You know anything about computers? - Mm-hm, I used to be a computer analyst. And there's a chapter in here called, um, Day of the Beast. It says that if a person takes the mark, that he is selling his soul to the devil, and that he'll be tormented forever. Well, I won't take that mark. (Billy coughs) I'd rather die first. - Well, that could be any minute if we don't get out of here. That chief goon out there is mean enough to be Satan himself. (crickets and frogs chirping) - Pull over right there, soldier, where do you think you're going? (engine revs) - Everybody down, quick! (gunfire) (dramatic music) - Everybody okay? - Leslie, Leslie. Oh. (sad music) - Did you find her? Is she all right? David? (engine revs) (Leslie gasps) (Leslie groans) Why are we sitting here, what's wrong? - Ssh, hang on, we can't outrun 'em, so we'll outsmart 'em. (birds chirping) (ducks quacking) (suspenseful music) (chickens clucking) - [Billy] Mommy, Mommy! - David, David! - What? - It's okay, your boy's fine. I'm not lookin' to harm you, I wanna help you. - He's my friend. - Glad this little fella told me who you were. Military Jeep in my front yard makes me rather nervous. - Who are you? - My name's Turner, who might you be? - I'm Pat Ryan, this is Jodi Reed. - Well, we'd better hide this thing and get some breakfast. - Now you can go out and play, okay? I'll see you later. - I wanna thank you, brother, for sharing. Where did you get, uh? - This kind of food? Well, the eggs are from Shall We and Rock 'Em, my two good hens over there, and the milk and cheese is from Eske over there. Of course, God spared an apple tree, and a few bushel of grain, and he let the sun shine and the rains fall, and things grew. We make it here pretty good. - Don't the authorities know you're here? - Oh, they know me. - And they don't confiscate the food? - But they don't know I'm here. To them I'm just a babbling old preacher who went haywire when the Christians disappeared. - You're a preacher, who are you? - Harmless old scavenger with just enough sense to keep body and soul together. I scavenge clothes and other necessities. But they don't know where I live. And like you, no mark, haha. Whaddya think, must have some sense, huh? - Well, if you're a preacher with no mark, why didn't you disappear with the Christians? - Who am I? Matthew Turner, preacher, pastor of the flock. I turned men away from God. Men, women, and children. Away from God's word. See? They don't know I have this either. I scavenged all the churches where the pastors and their flocks disappeared. - Do you believe like in First John four, that Jesus Christ was God come to earth in the flesh? - You a believer? - Yes, aren't you? - If you're a believer, then you know we're now in the tribulation period, referred to by the prophets Daniel, Ezekiel, John, and Jesus Christ. Seven seals, seven trumpets, seven bowls. - Could yesterday's earthquake be? - Yes, I believe we're now here. It's a terrible and awesome time. Many great things are to happen. Many more terrible are to come. The whole earth will suffer, but especially Israel in this time of Jacob's trouble, as Jeremiah called it. - How could things possibly be worse? - Well, Satan has been in heaven accusing the saints, but Christ has also been there, telling God that the sins of the saints have been washed away by his blood, according to Revelation chapter 12 verse 10. Michael and the good angels throw Satan and his angels out of heaven, Satan then comes to earth to vent his wrath and cunning on mankind with new fury. He knows his time will be short. - Then you, you think Satan's here now? - Yes, I believe he is beginning his final, terrible effort to overthrow God, if so, Daniel says we will now see three and a half years where the wrath of man mixed with the wrath of Satan is confronted by the terrible wrath and judgment of God. War will continue, Russia will invade Israel, then a great leader will rise up and save Israel. He will appear to be slain, then Satan will enter him and counterfeit his resurrection. This great leader will then pronounce himself world dictator destroy the world church, and be proclaimed greater than God. He will seize the temple, set up his image, and begin the most devastating persecution in the history of Israel. - Doesn't Satan understand prophecy? - Perhaps not fully, but according to James 2:19, he knows God's word, and he believes it. - [Leslie] I really praise God for you two. - You know, you're a mighty fortunate young lady. - But I'm afraid I'm going to be a terrible burden. - Do you realize that God has spared your life twice in the past few days? I believe he has a plan for you. - Listen, Kathy, I need your help. I've been working for almost a year now on a... Are you ready for this? A counterfeit mark. - A counterfeit mark? - Shh. - David, do you know about computers? - Oh yes, I used to design and build them. - What about equipment? - I don't have access to any, but if we could locate a hand computer, I'm close enough now for the two of us to really crack this thing open. - A calculator. - Now you might find this hard to believe, but right now I have a way of putting a mark on your hand that looks authentic. - David, you're a genius. Okay, what's the next step? - With what I've developed so far, we have freedom of movement. Of course we can't do any business because we don't have an account number in the central computer bank. - Oh, so when we put our code through the electronic scanners, it'll register. - Precisely. - Hm. What would happen if we put your mark through a scanner now? Would it reject? - Well, yes and no. You know the soldier whose uniform I took? I got his computer account number to his microfiche from his ID. We'll go into town, I'll feed it into the public terminal in the shopping mall, we'll see what he's got left in his account. - And when that's depleted? David, what makes this mark any different than the real mark? - This is our mark, not Satan's. This is a, this is a struggle for survival, not my commitment to Christ. - But the problem, though, David, is one of morality, isn't it? I mean I've seen lots of so-called Christians in church on Sunday, and then their hand in the till on Monday. - What's your definition of morality? This is war, we're opposing an ungodly regime. Now, do we just stand by and let the enemy march in to teach us, force us into ungodly ways? Kathy, if we can crack this code, believers around the world can join forces and take the offensive against Satan. Now I'll die before I'll take the mark, but I'll not sit by and let the enemy march in. I'm gonna do everything in my power to foul up his lousy system. The authorities will be looking for the ID numbers on the Jeep, we'll change them then we'll go anywhere. All we gotta do to get fuel is break that code. (rumbling engine) - What is it? - It's that goon that shot Leslie, let's get out of here. (foreboding music) - The ultimate question here is, how can the corporations cooperating with the church profit from the defeat of Israel? One of our greatest assets, of course, is that Brother Christopher as president of the Federated States of Europe, has been elected to lead us, giving us a vision, and a sense of leadership second to none. Current war effort in northeast Europe is giving us an opportunity for probably one of the most profitable ventures of our time. Therefore, our investment is sound. These share-investments have already gone up 28% in just a few weeks. The situation, you understand, is unique. Brother Christopher's alliance with Israel has seen that land flourish. She is an international plum, and major powers are willing to gamble everything to acquire her rich oil fields. The stakes are high, and many of you look at our proposals with raised eyebrows and wondering who in their right minds could go along with the preposterous idea that the little nation of Israel, even under Brother Christopher's leadership, could defeat Russia. It would indeed take a military genius. - Well, sir, what seems to be the problem. - Don't get start with me, soldier, I know who you are. Let me see your hands. - Now can we return to the service? - [Preacher] Cities, highways, dams, will require rebuilding, and we will sell this equipment to Russia at such a price that they would be stupid to bring it all from their homeland. - Kathy, Kathy Taylor! - Diane! (women squealing) - How are you? - It is so good to see you! - Oh I know. - Hello. - Hi there. - Oh, I'm sorry, this is my husband Jerry. - Diane is territorial supervisor with the food ration program. We used to work together. - I'm not there any longer. - Oh. - Gosh, it is really good to see you, say, when did you change your mind? Back in the old days, when the mark was optional, you said you'd never take it. - Well, it became mandatory, and I got hungry. - I'm glad you see you ironed out your difficulties with the authorities. - Oh yeah, they thought I was someone else. - Well, just run a CT biocheck and that'll satisfy 'em. What's your job classification? - CT dash 1A. - Oh, computers. Hey, bigshot, I'm impressed, what's your vocational assignment? - I, I'm really not free to discuss it right now. - Top secret classification. - Jerry, are you still with the fire rescue? - Well, sometimes I wish I was. - Gosh, it's so good to see you. We gotta get together, can we call you? - Hey, listen, why don't you let us call you? I can't explain the circumstance, but we don't exactly live like normal people. (chickens clucking) - C'mon. Do you wanna feed 'em Billy? That's it, get it right out there. That's the way, get some more. - You realize why I can't take the counterfeit mark, don't you, David? I appreciate the offer, though. It'd make me more conspicuous to the folks around here. They know I don't have it here, so they don't expect me to have it here. - You know, we had a close call today. - Yeah, we sure did. - And a strange experience at church. - You went to church? - Well, we didn't have much of a choice. - The World Church, huh? - Well, it felt more like the boardroom to a major corporation. - There's your World Church. When the Christians disappeared, some of the churches collapsed for lack of members. But for the rest, they just joined together in one big sin-infested, humanistic body, the World Church. In the Bible, the book of Revelation calls her the Great Prostitute that commits adultery with the kings of the earth. - Adultery? - Were they worshiping God where you were in that church where you were today? - Hardly. - Seemed more like they were selling investments and war materials. - Exactly, teaching people to traffic in war, in blood, in things of the flesh. That's your Scarlet Woman, riding on the Beast. - Oh, I see, it's supposed to be a church, but they've left God out entirely. - Is the Antichrist in there somewhere? - Eventually yes, but first will be the end of the Scarlet Woman and her illicit relations with kings and merchants. When Satan's day has come, he will enter into this great, trusted world leader, causing him to appear to rise from the dead. Then the Jews who mourned his death will proclaim him the Messiah. Satan will then become jealous of the World Church and destroy her through this resurrected leader, the Antichrist, then he'll take all her wealth. But overpowering this phony church will not satisfy him. Satan will not stop until all men worship him. So he'll place an image of this beast, the Antichrist, in the Holy of Holies, the new Jewish temple. Then he'll require worship of this beast by all the people of the world. - Horrible. - Why, David? - Because the true Israelite cannot worship an image. - That's right, Daniel calls it the abomination of desolation. At that precise moment, every faithful Jew will know the heart-splitting agony of the centuries. The one they loved and worshiped as the Messiah will have become Antichrist, enemy of God and God's people. As they flee Jerusalem in the most wrenching persecution ever known, their groaning spirits will begin to realize that their true Messiah was crucified outside Jerusalem, 20 centuries ago. - This book I have, Computer Prophecy, talks about how a lot of people will turn to God near the end because of thousands of special teachers. - 144,000, yes. 12,00 from each tribe of Israel. Pure, undefiled, sealed as servants of God. They bring multitudes to Christ during these last days of tribulation. - I guess I just don't understand why all this is happening. - Well, God is allowing men and nations to bring judgment upon themselves. Man's sin brings the judgment. Man has always told God, just leave us alone and mankind will make things better. So God has removed his spirit from the world. Now he's giving mankind what we really always wanted. A world without God. - At a pernicious time in our history, the northern coalition of Russia is recognized as one of the greatest political gambles of our time. It's been nearly five weeks since the initial attack was made by Egyptian forces from the south. A tragic end, however, on the eve of victory. Brother Christopher, struck down by what appears to have been an assassin's bullet. Gray, what does this all mean? - Bob, I haven't seen such international grief since John F. Kennedy was struck down in the early 60s. - But it's difficult to understand that a man who certainly stands with Julius Caesar and with Napoleon, was loved, worshiped if you will, by so many. - I can't recall anyone in my lifetime that had the quality of leadership and charisma that this man possessed. - I still can't believe it. I mean the world waits for years for a man with his military genius and political savvy to come along, and bingo. - I know. And besides, I thought it was charming. - [Jerry] Hey, how's the calculator working, Pat? - Oh, working fine, appreciate the use of it. - Sure. Pat, I've got a proposition to make you. We did a computer check on you, an extensive one at that. My people are very impressed. - Your people? - I never told you until now because I had to be absolutely sure of your credentials. Diane and I are special agents. - Believers Underground Movement Squad. - BUMS. - [Jerry] I beg your pardon. - Oh, I just have a habit of abbreviating corporate names and well, yours just came out a little funny. - What's your proposition, Jerry? - We could use a man like you. You know there is absolutely no proof anywhere to substantiate the fact that you're involved in computers, I mean your cover is flawless. - Mm, we've really had a problem with those fanatics. - Their movement keeps growing despite our efforts. - Well, I have no control over my job classification. You know that. - No I can take care of that, you see, we have priority over all agencies. - Um, let me, let me think on it for a while. Oh, nuts. - Well, I think the batteries are dead. - Yes. - I hate going into that city, it really scares me. Doesn't anyone have batteries? Where are we gonna look now, David? - I was hoping to avoid the food center, but I guess it's the only place. - [Radio Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, this is URN, the United Radio Network, with a new bulletin direct from United Radio in Jerusalemn and Jack Mulke. - [Jack] It's been confirmed, just a little over an hour ago, it was reported that Brother Christopher had, by some miracle, been healed. It's bedlam here, as you can probably imagine. Ladies, and, yes, ladies and gentlemen, we switch you now to the temple, where apparently Brother Christopher is ready to make a statement. - [Christopher] Yes, I am alive, more alive than I have ever been. Do not fear. - [Jack] Apparently that's all he's going to say. It's a wonderful sight to behold, truly one of the most exciting moments of my life. A great, great day for the world. We'll be keeping you informed as the situation develops. This is Jack Mulke, United Radio, Jerusalem. - [Announcer] All business establishments will close immediately. Everyone, return to your homes. All business establishments will close immediately. Everyone, return to your homes. (gentle music) - Well, we've been together for some time now, and well... - I know what you're trying to say, Kathy, and I think with everything that's going on, what you really need is a relationship with Jesus Christ. - Why? - Because death is inevitable for us. Next year, next month, tomorrow. It's just a matter of time. - I know, David, I just try not to think about it. - When you go before God and he says, Kathy, why should I let you into my heaven? What are you going to say to him, hm? In Revelation 3:20, Jesus said, Behold, I stand at the door and knock, if any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come to him. - That's not fair, I didn't know, I didn't know about that, David. - Well you know it now. You know the two of us, we try to rationalize God with our finite minds. - What's wrong with trying to understand? - Because we didn't try to understand it, don't you see? We just complicated it. We complicated something that was so simple, so obvious, all we had to do was believe it. I'm trying to make you realize that the reason you still have an opportunity to receive Jesus is because you never heard the plan of salvation before the rapture, if you had heard it and rejected it, then you'd never again have any hope of eternal life in heaven. - Is that in the Bible? - It's Second Thessalonians, second chapter. Oh Kathy, don't throw your life away. Give it to Jesus while there's still time, please. (Kathy sighs) - I don't know. You know, you and I are worlds apart, David. Here I am, talking about facts, real people, events. And you're talking about a 2,000 year old book with stories in it that... Let's talk reality, David. - You wanna talk reality? - Yeah. - Well, reality was three and a half years ago when your husband and millions of others vanished, and that's reality. - They said it was UFOs. - Would you like to hear the Bible's version? - Cold out, is it? - No, it's nice out, as a matter of fact. - We were having a little Bible study. I wanna look something up. First Thessalonians, chapter four, verses 16 and 17. For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will be with the Lord forever. That's reality, Kathy. You want facts? Over 300 prophecies in the Bible have come to pass since the birth of Christ. - Sounds like you've studied it. - I've searched this book through and through. A little late unfortunately, but I know what it's like -- - We interrupt this program to bring you the following news bulletin. - [Reporter] Two men were slain just minutes ago on the streets of Jerusalem. Reliable sources have indicated that Brother Christopher was responsible for ridding the world of these two most powerful religious fanatics. They have been converting Jews to preach the gospel. Repeating, two men were slain just minutes ago on the streets of Jerusalem. Brother Christopher has stated that the bodies will remain as mute testimony to what happens when religious fanatics interfere with the political and economic well-being of our people. Here is late word, just in. All energy-producing companies are now under the direct supervision of the chairman. This includes all energy holdings of the World Church organization. - Now he's done it, he's done it. - What's he done? - He's killed God's saints. Like Moses and Elijah they were. Satan himself has entered Brother Christopher. It must be, the staging of the counterfeit resurrection. Satan, through Brother Christopher will continue now to try to destroy God's people and Israel. - What's going to happen? - God's wrath will pour out on the earth through the trumpet judgments, Kathy. They can begin any time now. God's message to man is repent, turn from Satan's deception to Jesus for salvation, so even though the body may be destroyed, the soul will escape judgment. - Well we're all just like cattle, waiting for the slaughter. David, I'm scared, you've done this before, I haven't. - Just do exactly as I told you and things will go fine. - Tell me again. - When you're going through your checkout lane, just remember, we both have the same account numbers on our IDs, so make sure you clear your register before my first purchase is recorded. Otherwise the computer will abort, thinking the same person is going through two lanes. - I've gotta get through my checkout lane before you can get through yours. - Now move as quickly as you can, cause if we get caught... - Okay, and then I wait for you outside, right? - Right. (scanner beeping) - Shopping these days is quite a chore. - You think it's bad now, just wait til the High Priest comes to town. (suspenseful music) - What's the matter, lady? You run out of room in your shopping cart, eh? Let's see what else you have on you. - I'm, uh, I'm still waiting for my wife. Why don't you go ahead, huh? - Hey mister, don't hold up the line! - Are you gonna see him when he comes to town? - Oh, who? - The High Priest. - Yes, I wouldn't miss that for the world. - That'll be 72 EFTs. Oh nuts, that's the second time it's jammed today. Oh wait, you can't leave without your receipt. - I'll be right back, I left my baby in the car. - Oh, excuse me, ma'am. Before you ring that up, I have another one just like it. Maybe you wanna ring them up together. This is it right here, yep, okay, there you go. - Sir, you're holding up the line. - Oh, I thought I'd put everything up. I'm sorry, I do have a few more items here. Maybe you wanna ring that one up. - Oh Don, will you find that lady that was just here? I can't transact any more business until she gets this receipt. - I do have a couple of more things here, let's see. (alarm wailing) - [Man On Radio] Sector 15, Sector 15, one-five, one-five. UNITE van has been stolen, heading northeast, subject is male Caucasian about 5'11", Navy gear, wearing uniform. (multiple sirens wailing) - Ugh. - Okay, c'mon, get out of there. (phone ringing) - [Announcer On Radio] We interrupt this program -- - [Jerry] This is Jerry Bradford. - [Announcer] It's a phenomenon that no one can explain. For three days, these two man, thought to be like Elijah and Moses, lying dead in the street, now are among the living. - [Jerry] I don't wanna hear about it. - [Announcer] The crowds came to look, and they suddenly got up, dusted themselves off as if they had been merely taking a nap. - I want that man executed. Don't argue with me, I want it done as soon as the papers are processed. John, I want you to see to it that those papers are expedited, I want them on my desk no later than Friday. - Jerry, listen, you can't execute that man. - No, you listen, that man sat at my table, ate my food, pretended to be my friend, and using a calculator that my wife lent him, is trying to counterfeit and foul up our system. I am the laughingstock of this agency. - Jerry, calm down, I understand how you feel. But if he knows how that code can be duplicated, we've gotta have that information. And if the woman's working with him, we've gotta get her too, and right now, only he knows where she is. - Okay. Okay. You're right, John, you've got it all figured out. So what happens next? - What happens? Will it be worse than what we've been going through? - Yes it'll be worse. The first trumpet is a judgment of fire on the earth's vegetation, forest and grassfires ignited by lightning, mingled with hail and blood. It's a plague on men and their thanklessness for what God provided on a productive earth. - Isn't that a literal interpretation, though? - The plagues of Egypt were literal, Kathy. Verified by secular history, we have to be careful not to wish away the trumpet plagues by thinking they'll be social, political, or economic problems. According to Revelations chapter eight, verse eight, and the second angel sounded, and as it were, a great mountain, burning with fire, was cast into the sea, making the third part of the sea into blood. One-third of the marine life will die. Shipping will be destroyed, and people who turned to the sea for food when the drought came will starve. Trumpet number three is a plague on drinking water. According to Revelations eight, verses 10 and 11, a burning meteor called Wormwood falls to earth, polluting the rivers and poisoning one-third of the drinking water. - This is incredible. - Trumpet number four is a plague of darkness on the earth. One-third of the sun, moon, and stars will go dark. In like manner, spiritual darkness will settle over the world. Trumpet number five unleashes a plague of smoke and locusts from the pit that is the center of the earth. What a frightful creature this locust will be. The body of a horse, human face, crown on the head, long hair, and lion's teeth. And wings that sound like thundering horses rushing into battle, and worse, they have long tails and stings like scorpions. The sting is terrible, it doesn't kill you, it just leaves you in a state of torment for five months. Only those sealed by God will be exempt. It's an intense, horrible torment. Death will be preferable but not possible. Trumpet number six consists of 200 million horses and horsemen, loosed to destroy one-third of the earth's population. - 200 million horses? - There were that many horses in China in the late 70s, Kathy. Anyway, the seventh trumpet is a review of all the others, a warning to men, Kathy, this is not God's temper tantrum. It's a sifting process to get the lost to respond to Christ. - Ugh. Tried, David, I really tried. - Release him. - Who? - You know who. - What? - Listen, the cashier at food center 33 said the woman indicated that she was going to see the high priest next month. - Which means? - If the woman does attend the event, she may be the bait to lure the fish. Release David Michaels, give him a pair of boots, plant a transmitter, and tail him. If the plan works, we've got them both. - David, you are an amazing fellow, a very talented individual. You have a list of charges against you that would normally cause the authorities to take your head with a golden blade. Murder, fraud, resisting the authorities, trying to infiltrate our security system, not to mention the fool you made out of me. I wanna tell you something, friend. You may not realize this, but I have a reputation as the top agent, the top agent in this organization. Did you know that? Well, I'm not a fool, make no mistake about that, but that's why I'm willing to make a deal with you. I've spent the last few days convincing my superiors that you are more valuable alive, interested? - Not if it means taking your mark. - No no no, David, nothing like that. Anyone who can pull off a scheme such as yours could be the greatest underground agent in this organization, we could make real progress. What do you say? - I'm no fool either, Jerry. - I didn't think you were, David, I didn't think you were. - And by the way I never killed anyone. - Oh come now, David, you were wearing Pat Ryan's uniform the night he died. - He was just about to shoot me. I threw a piece of pipe at him, he fell and hit his head on some machinery. It was self-defense. - Kid, it doesn't make any difference anyway, your sins are forgiven, to use the cool if soon to be forgotten phrase. Take a few days and relax, and we'll get together next week and go to work. - I am a voice crying in the wilderness, make straight the pathways of your heart. Make them straight to Brother Christopher. To you who live and labor in the heartland of this great world, Brother Christopher sends his praise and his promise. Praise for your steadfastness in the face of drought, destruction, and disease. Plagues brought on you by the dark God of Jesus Christ. Resist him! (electronic beeping) Promise for the preservation of a land. Working together with Brother Christopher, we will make this world productive again, so follow him, he will provide for every need. - [Man] Bail out! - [Man On Radio] No quarter, no quarter. Sectional seven niner five, one kilometer north of red section seven niner five. Fugitive on foot, believed to be unarmed. (voice drowned out by dramatic music) No quarter, no quarter. (helicopter whirring) - [Pilot] No no don't shoot, if he falls off we'll tip over. I'll find a place to put him down. (triumphant music) (birds whistling) (helicopter whirring) - [Kathy] What's this? - That's a replica of the temple of Herrod, the one that Christ worshiped in. But today's temple is defiled by the worst sacrilege that could possibly befall Israel. - Really, what happened? - The computer, Kathy. The computer has been the most innovative and time-saving device known to man. Paid bills, made travel reservations, cooked meals. It's the new golden calf. A computer that speaks and convinces people that it thinks, hundreds of millions of people will worship that inanimate object, and it's in the temple. - My friends and loyal subjects, for the last four years, we have worked together to overcome the greatest physical hardships the world has ever known. World war, drought, famine, pestilence, fire, earthquakes and volcanoes of unprecedented violence. But we have prevailed, thanks to our fantastic computer technology and the intervention of his satanic majesty. Where, dear friend, was the loving God of creation during our recent perils? Was he helping mankind, the children of his creation? No, on the contrary, it is he who has visited these disasters upon us, and to you, God, God of wrath and destruction to mankind, I say do your worst, but we will prevail. - Ladies and gentlemen, you have just heard Brother Christopher, live via UTN, the United Television Network, bringing you the evening message, and the message will be brought to you tomorrow night one hour early. - You know, it frightens me, Martha. I know God has spared me for a purpose, but I feel so, so boxed in. - Don't think about it, child, just take one day at a time. That's all he expects. - I know. (thunder crashes) - As you are all aware, we're faced with the most perilous times in recorded history. Man has the capabilities of totally annihilating the human race, the Bible refers to these times as Jacob's Trouble, Daniel records that the wicked shall hear but not understand, but the righteous, they shall understand. (thunder crashes) Absolute love and absolute judgment develop extremes which our minds reject. You see, we are creatures of compromise, and when something that we can't comprehend develops, we just merely say it doesn't exist. But both extremes surely do exist. Luke reveals in chapter 13 verses two and five, did I tell you nay, Jesus says, that unless you repent, ye will likewise perish. (fire crackling) God's judgment is real, but his love is real, and he reveals his precious love through his son, Jesus Christ. You know he wants us to yield to that love, and we escape the judgment. John reveals so beautifully that God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life. Oh how God loves us, how God loves us. (fire crackling and exploding) ...don't realize the importance of Bible prophecy, but the Bible clearly reveals that in this (speaker is drowned out by rain) of the heart, but I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he has indebted to the whole law and Christ is become of no effect unto him, whosoever you are, justified by the law... (speaker drowned out by swelling music) - [David] Beginning to feel like my old self. - David, David! - Billy, come here! Boy, you've gotten big! - I thought the goons got you. - No, the goons didn't get me, big fella. It's gonna take more than goons to get me. (foreboding music) Dear God, there's nothing left. - [Kathy] Will anything ever grow again? - Yes, grass will grow in some areas. A hundred miles from here, or even five or ten, things could be normal, depends on where the firestorms hit. - Can grandpa come and stay with us? - No Billy, it'll be too dangerous for him. Your mother and I have some important work to do, so we'll be moving away. (birds singing) - It's hard to believe that 15 miles from here it looks like the moon. - Well, it might not look like that now. Some of it could have grown back. - You know, I never really appreciated -- - Mom, David, I found a great hideout! Come and see it, come and see it. - All right, let's do it. - You've been a little explorer this morning, haven't you? - Come on and show it. - Come on, let's go. - There it is. - Oooh. - Hey, great. - [Billy] Those goons ever try to get us, we'll hide right there. - Good work, cowboy, that's a great spot, great spot. Well, I guess there is one flaw in the Bible. Seems to me it says there will be no place to hide. - Right here! (Kathy screaming) - David! - Oh no, there goes our water. Kathy, we're gonna have to push harder on that code. Listen, I found out about a young woman who knows someone who works in the central computer bank. She knows about our project and wants to meet you. - [Kathy] David... You know, that doesn't look like a storm. - Mom, why is it gettin' dark so fast? Does that mean I have to go to bed now? - I don't know, honey, but you don't have to go to bed yet. I think we better go inside, okay. David, are you still going to go? - [David] I'll be back tomorrow. (Kathy crying) - Oh no, it's been here all the time! - [David Voiceover] We complicated something that was so simple, so obvious, all we had to do was believe it. - Whenever I... I never would have left you there if I'd have known, if I'd have known there was any chance. Forgive me, Leslie, please. - David... - I thought about you so much. How long have you been, how long have you been here? - Since it happened. - I can't believe for, for over a year, I've lived less than a quarter of a mile away from you. - David, I've dreamed about a moment like this. But I... I love you, David. - [David] Are you sure we can trust her? - Look, this is an important contact. I think it's worth the risk. - I'm sorry we have to meet like this. I understand that you've created a counterfeit mark. - Where did you ever get information like that? - Good news travels fast in times like these. - Well, listen, I'm sorry, you must be mistaken. Who are you? - I know who she is. - You betrayed us, you're not even human! - Remember me? - David. - Oh yes. General Goon, are you still upset cause I got your soldier suit all dirty? (crickets chirping) (Kathy gasps) - One week from tonight, your head's gonna be in a basket. - No, Billy, your hideout, quick. - Rotten little religious fanatic. My grinning face is gonna be the last thing you ever see before your head falls in a basket. C'mon! You know, it's taken us years to catch you. And I can't say it hasn't been a challenge. - Yeah well you don't have David. (loud buzzing) (screaming) - Billy, Billy! Billy! (Kathy screaming) (explosion) (woman screaming) - Okay, we have one good reason why you will tell us the whereabouts of Kathy Ray. Bring that kid in here! (woman sobbing) - Billy. You can't send him out there, he's just a child. - He will go out there, unless you tell us where his mother is. - You liar, if I did tell you, you'd butcher them both. - Take him downstairs. The boy goes to the platform tomorrow unless you change your mind. - I wanna see Leslie. - If you tell us where the boy's mother is. (distant tortured screams) - Hey, where'd you get that balloon, and all those things to play with? - Oh, that one lady's trying to get me to like her so I"ll tell her where my mom is, except I don't know where she is. - Do you ever make things with that kind of paper. - No, I always draw on it. - Want me to show you how? - Okay. - Give you something to do here. - Heavenly Father, I claim your promise in Proverbs 3:6 that if we acknowledge you in all our ways, you will direct our paths. And Lord... - Thank you for the peace in my soul as I face death this morning. Father, the delight of your love shines so brightly in me that those who execute me will know that you are real, and if there is yet time for me to serve you, help me to do it. In the wonderful name of our precious lord Jesus Christ, amen. Good morning. - Are you gonna die? - Yes, Billy, I am going to die. - [Billy] You afraid? - Have you ever heard about Jesus? - [Billy] Yes, David talks about him a lot. - Would you like to hear about where I'm going today? - [Billy] Okay. - Well, for a person like me who has Jesus in her heart, Billy, that is like blowing out a lamp before the dawn. - What's it like there? - Well, I made a little storybook for you. It doesn't have any pictures and it doesn't have any words, but it's the most wonderful story in the whole world. - How can it be a good story if it doesn't have any pictures? - Let's see how it ends first. - This gold page tells us all about heaven. It's God's home, filled with brightness and glory. The Bible says that heaven has streets made of pure gold like glass, no one is ever sick, no one dies, and everybody's happy. - Does everybody go there? - Well, God would like everybody to go there, but there's one thing that can never be in heaven. - What's that? - Sin. - Sin, what's sin? - It's when you and I do things our way instead of God's way. It's doing, saying, or thinking bad things. Anything that makes God unhappy. That' what this black page reminds us of, sin in our lives. When it's dark, we stumble and can't find our way. And sin, Billy, is what separates us from God. - What's on the next page? - This red page shows us the way God made for you and me to have our sins forgiven, or taken away. God sent his son Jesus from heaven to take our punishment for sin, wicked men nailed Jesus to a cross, and God put all our sins on him. - You mean all our naughty stuff? - That's stuff, our lies, our meanness. And the Bible says that the blood of Jesus is what cleanses us from sin. - What color is next page? - The next page is white. You know what that means? - No. - It means we can be made clean from our sin. - You mean everybody? My mom, me, and David? - If they believe that Jesus died for them they can. Billy, have you ever sinned? - I guess so, I'm naughty sometimes. - Would you like to receive Jesus into your heart now and have your sins forgiven so that you can go to heaven? - With you? - That's right. - Yeah. - You scum, you filthy rotten scum! He was just a child! Just a baby. Just a boy. (David crying) Dear God. Billy? I thought... What happened to your balloon? - I gave it to Miss Leslie cause she gave me Jesus, so I gave her my balloon. - Do we take the boy to the platform, or do you tell us where his mother is? - Billy, you're free. I want you to go and be with Leslie. They're gonna take you outside and lay you down. Now you close your eyes, and tell 'em you love Jesus no matter what. - Shut up! - Now I ask you, what can you do now? The boy is free, he belongs to Jesus Christ. - You're next. - [David Voiceover] Jesus said in John 14:6, I am the way, the truth, and the life, and no man cometh to the father but by me. - [Preacher In Cave Voiceover] John reveals so beautifully that God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life. Oh, how God loves us, how God loves us. (triumphant music)
