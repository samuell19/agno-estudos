[panting] [panting] [coins clinking] [Nora] Evan! [coins clinking] Evan! Are you home? Evan. Didn't hear your truck. Hey! [Nora screaming] You... Jesus Christ! Think you're so damn smart! -Sorry. -So goddamn smart! Where is your truck? I didn't hear it. [Evan] It's on the road. Bastard. If you ever, ever scare me like that again... And the champ is down. Think you're so smart. Give a girl a heart attack like that. I know a woman who died right off the bat like that. [Evan grunting] -What? -I think you broke my nose. Oh, don't be such a baby all the time. Let me see. -Let me see. -All right, yeah. Jesus! Evan! Evan! Watch out for my meat pies! Evan! Time for your Christmas goose. [laughing] Evan! Evan. Hi, mum. Is anything wrong? Hello, Darnene. It's a desperate cold out there, isn't it? You already have a piece of bread, Evan. Hmm? I simply said you already have a piece of bread, Evan. Hmm. Well. I just want to shove this in and get out there get the register fixed on the goddamn truck and get off the goddamn road-- Probably hung over. Are you coming to the Confession with us? It's the Friday before Christmas. Hmm. Maybe yes, maybe no. Plus, I want to get the goddamn truck fixed. Oh. I'm sorry. Anybody watchin' with their dessert? [burps] Excuse me. Darling, what's for dessert? Ginger bread and whipped cream. Oh, well. I gotta get out there. I'll have it later. I mean, it's no trouble, having it later, is it? No. No problem. Just made it special, that's all. So, you're coming to the dance with us later, Darnene? At the old community center? No. I wouldn't go there. You know that. It's bad enough my daughter dragging herself there. Well, I suppose. I'll see you there, then. Oh, Darnene. Have a good time at the Confession. I had a man livin' like that for 30 years. What, mummy? [beeping] I had a man who lived like that, Nora. You know yourself. Out of work and sitting about. Coughing now and then just to show he's alive. He moved his foot once or twice so the vacuum wouldn't run over him. Other than that, he was fairly quiet. Evan's never been out of work in his life. Till the mines closed down. Is your IC gone? So close to Christmas. Not much we can do about that. Just ride it out. Be back to work in the spring. I'm trying to get pregnant. But maybe it's not the right time. Well... I never say anything. Evan just thinks I'm an old fool. Because I'm concerned about my daughter. Concerned... about my daughter. [horn blaring] And to think they'd pick up two women and give them a drive to church. They won't confess that, will they? Hmm. Ladies who are broke. You need any money, mum? Any extra? Oh, never mind me. 'Cause we always have a little extra. Oh, never mind me. Could use $50 just to tie me over. And a few little things until my check comes along. Never mind me, I'll make out. $50, is that all? Ha. Ha, ha, ha. Is that all? Never mind me, I don't want to bother. Putting it out in the world. It's $50, just have a little extra until January. I know very well how they treat old people. Leave them alone They'd need blizzards for Christmas. Ha, I'm coming down with cramps. Right, well. $50 it is, then. [sighing] Okay... come on. Come on, you son of a bitch. Where is the old bonnet? "Oh, the flashlight for us for the meeting, huh." Of course she's gonna need you to deliver meat pies, isn't she? Oh, yes, you will. [coughing] Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. My last confession was two weeks ago. [whispering] I lied, Father, a few times, to Evan who asked me when I went to town why I didn't put gas in the truck. And I told him gas wasn't my responsibility. It was his freaking responsibility to put gas in the truck. But it was really because I didn't have the money. And again yesterday, father, he asked me about our bank account. I told him we had $127.34 in it. And we did. But I took $100 to pay off the oil bill. I did that before he got angry because he said we could've paid it off in the spring, but how was he gonna do that, father, when he needs a new engine for his boat if he doesn't get back on the mines? And I feel bad owing the money. I always feel bad, I mean, I know Irving has all this money, they're rich, they don't care about the little guy. And we are just a little guy to them as Evan says, but I still think if you owe the money, you have to pay it. So I paid some of it off. However, I didn't tell him about the truck acting up on him because I didn't tell him, he's stuck out on the road tonight. It's a million half below outside. And father, [stumbling] it was never much of a truck anyway. Take a breath, Nora. [exhaling] What about his unemployment insurance? It's run out, but father I said the F-word too. I was doing real good at not saying it and then I dropped the whole bag of flour right on the floor. And then today, Evan comes in and he's hiding in the kitchen and he scared me half to death. And I took the name of Our Lord a few times then. But I do promise to do better than that, I promise. So aside from lying, saying the F-word, and taking Our Lord's name in vain, I keep doing okay, I do. Nora, you got to learn to speak slower, I... I can't understand half of what you say. I'm sorry, father. [whispering] [Father] Try and come back on the swearing, Nora. And you've got to be honest about oil bills, other things, I mean, he too has a right to know what's in your bank account. Yes, father. Are you... are you coming tomorrow to help with the manger? Oh, yes, father, I'll be there. Be good to see Evan here once in a while. I know, father. Huh, oh, four Hail Mary, Nora. -Yes, father. -Very good. [blizzard blowing] [coughing] Darling, now that I rigged it, look at her. Probably fluttering all hell. Oh, Jesus. Come here, come here, you old Jesus lost part in the snow. Come on. Hmm. Cuff links. No doubt about it. [chuckles] [panting] [kisses] [wind blowing] [exclaiming] That's all right. Good boy, ha! You know we're gonna purge you on the road, you know it. [engine revs] Jesus! Oh, shit! [thumping] [clattering] [knocking at door] -Evan? -Huh? I didn't hear the truck. Truck's stuck in the road, what are you doin'? I'm... -Rolling pennies. -You what? Rolling pennies. What for? For the dance tonight. Have we got money in the drawer? Are those your world record pennies? Well, not rolling all of them. Just enough for the dance tonight. Are we going to the dance or not? Yeah, yeah. First, you get out and get the truck off road. Mum asked me for some money tonight. I told her that sometime next week we'd give her $50. Mark it down in the book and when we get the money from the wood we can afford it then. [exhales] Let me see your checkbook. Hmm? Let me see your checkbook. Checkbook, you mean... the account book? No, I mean the checkbook. When we get to the dance floor, I'll write check at the bar. Hmm... It'll save your bucket of pennies. Well, now, don't worry about them. Very well. You were the one who was possessed by the idea that by year 2000 or whatever... we're gonna have the Guinness World Book of Records for penny collecting. Now you're just gonna whittle it down for the dance? Come on, I'm gonna get the truck off the road, -we'll get there in an hour. -Okay. All right, just a second. All right. I don't want some vermin to steal all our life savings. Is the emergency brake on? What? God, get the wax out here for Chrissake. I said, is the emergency brake on? Of course not. [juddering] I heard that. [police car siren wailing] [panting] [indistinct chatter on radio] What's the problem? Don't know, won't call some damn thing. We can't leave it here, I have to get it towed. Oh, I can't afford a tow. Just give me half hour, I'll get it off the road. No, you're gonna have to tow it. You can't leave it sitting here in the middle of the road all night. You wanna be responsible for an accident? There's a grater coming up behind you here. -What? No, don't radio... -Newcastle detachment for Chrissake, just give me a push up to that car over there. There's plenty of room for cars to pass. Yes, we have an immobile vehicle on Route Eight near the Lord Community Center. Call Jeff and tell him to bring us the tow truck. Well, you pocket off the money, do you? You watch your tongue. Evan, let's just go to the dance and never mind. Jesus Christ, I need the truck to haul load of wood for tomorrow. One more word and you'll spend the night in jail for obstruction. Well, who the hell is sayin' anything, hmm? [slam] So why don't you just take it to our yard, it's just half an mile down the road here. Sorry, ma'am, I have to impound it until he pays for it. Um... how much is the cost to tow a truck nowadays? I'll have to charge you $60. I can write you a check. Sorry. But we'll just take it along and put it in the yard till your husband pays for it. Okay, we need the truck tomorrow and then he needs to work on it tonight to fix whatever's wrong with it and I have meat pies to deliver and then he has a whole... load of wood to take to Ferry Road. And if I don't get rid of my meat pies I won't have any money for Christmas presents and-- What if the check bounces, what about my Christmas presents? Well, no, no, it won't and... besides you know where we live. And we've never done anything dishonest, you can ask anyone around here. [Nora] Okay, hold on. So, where do you want this thing? Over by the wood, pal. Oh. Oh, I need to pee so bad but Oh, shoot. Where is it? Oh, here you are. [gate creaking] Okay, Evan you wanna go? Have you cooled down enough? Come on, we'll take you home. Take your wife to the dance, forget it. Can I go? I love to dance. Well, thank you too, Delaney. Uh-oh, there he is. It can't cost $5.50 anymore, now you cost $6. Box. -Should I say... -Who? The police. Not now, get in there and turn it over. Slightly, just slightly, I want you to see if my points are open. -You're not gonna charge her? -No, no. [engine sputtering] Whoa, hold it, hold it, never mind. Hmm, points are okay. What seems to be? Figure we're gonna make $204 on my meat pies. You got a way to deliver them? Come on, mister, fix this truck so we can go to the dance. Listen, I wrote a check for the chain saw. and wrote it for the lumber, so if really wanna get this truck towed, it's gonna bounce. [somber music playing] [sighs] Oh, don't worry about the money. Don't worry about the money. At least I don't wanna come back here Monday afternoon, don't wanna haul your ass off to jail. Miss your plum pudding. At least it's not bad as last year. What last year? "What last year?" When you wrote the last $100 to Irving Oil. [sighs] How much for the lumber and the chain saw? Hundred and fifteen bucks. Oh, shit. Oh well, we'll be millionaires again when I sell my pies. Come on, let's leave this truck. Let's go to the dance. -Come on. -Okay. All right. [country music playing] -Come on, slowpoke. -Slowpoke? -Come here, you. -Hey. [bartender] Another Coke, coming up. Do you have any cold beer pint? -Yep. -Can I have two cold beer pints, please. Forty cents. My pennies. Good, not counterfeit. All right, Nora, anything for you, darling. She got her piggy banks. Aw... -Hello, Angela, how are you? -Hello, Nora. Nice to see old friends, isn't it? [applause] [slow-tempo song playing] Come on, let's dance. Take one for me, Angela. I'm getting engaged, you know, Evan. Are ya? Everyone knows I am. [blowing out forcefully] Shall I? Hey, Angie. It'll be all, good tonight. It'll be all hot. Two rums! You seen Angela? Yeah, she's here. She's uh, over there somewhere. Say here, one for the ditch. Hey, you seen Angela? She's out dancing with Boyd. Hey, here we go. [Angela laughing] Yeah. We have enough for another beer? No. Okay. Here, I don't want it anymore. [up-tempo song playing] -Cheers, Reggie. -Two doubles. -Rum. -Comin' up. You can sip that stuff, do you know, boy? [grunting] [laughing] Hold on, I'll wrestle. No, no, Frankie, dear. -I'm arm wrestling. -Frankie, Frankie. I'm arm wrestling. Frankie. Sure, man. Let's do it. Gotcha. Ah, he's got me. He's got me, he's got me. He's got me, he's got me. [grunting] Woo! [slapping] [grunts] Hey there... Christ! Hey, hey! Oi, all right, all right. Hey, hey, you okay? Get out of here. Come on, Evan, let's go. Wait a sec. Hey, hey! Come on, settle down. Hey, settle down. -Stop. -Hey. Jesus, come on. Hey, hey! Get off! Nora? What the hell are you lookin' at? There she is rubbin' up and down your leg. Ha! Ha-ha-ha. Oh, come on, Nora, she dragged me up to the dance floor. Oh, you just the loved the way we're all getting to know each other again? [scoffs] You know I knew Evan before he ever knew you. Yeah, ha! Dick. Nora, shut up, eh. I gotta get up in three hours. We gotta try and fix that truck. She wants two-phase cord-- You know she does that with everybody, don't worry! Everybody! Poor Frankie. Yeah, like I wanna be that popular. Pfft, ha! Gotta get up in three hours. And drive the load of lumber up the Ferry Road. I'm tired, I worked all day! Well, I worked all day too! I made 35 meat pies since Tuesday, you know. Ha! Angela! [dogs barking] It's the color of my true love to you. Except for you, I love you too, Okay, I'm coming right back and then we'll have a chat. Whoa, turning the key. Here we go. [groaning] Don't you... don't you ever ever hurt my finger again. I'll see you now. Come on, you and I will have some, some fun together. My little doggie woggie, you love me so much. I love you too. You're my favorite doggie woggies in the... hey, wait... [dogs barking] Hey! Come back. I love you. [ticking] Yoo-hoo, hey! Yoo-hoo. [knocking at door] -Frankie. -Nora. -What in the hell happened to you? -Can I come in? I... fell in the snow trying to get my dogs. They're gone now. Hmm. Okay, darling. [moaning] Yeah, yeah. Almost stood myself in tonight. It was a big fight. Mm-hmm. Frankie, do you wanna go to sleep now? At least I know who I am from now on. Frankie, jeez, are you all right? -Are you all right? -Where is Evan? Evan's asleep, he has to get up in the morning. -Where's Evan? -Shh. -I've got a fist for him too. -Frankie, Frankie, Frankie. Don't yell, don't yell. I wanna show him what I got. You're gonna have a good drink of coffee, it's what you're gonna have. Right now. I wanna show him what I got. Frankie. [shushing] [thumping] Do you like me, Nora? Do you like me, Nora? Of course I like you, Frankie. Do you think Angela will like this ring? Well... It's a lovely ring, Frankie. Isn't this a lovely ring? -Mm-hmm. -800 bucks. 800 bucks. In this little, little... little, little, little ring. It's a lovely ring. It's for Angela. She's a lucky girl. Do you think she'll like it? Of course, she'll like it, why wouldn't she like it? You see, in fight tonight, I got couple of good slaps, Didn't I? Did I or didn't I? Yeah, you did. There's more of where that came from too. [clinking] Oh, Frankie. I'm ruined. Oh, Frankie, Jesus old jumpins. Frankie... Frank. Shit. Out, come, help. Out. [rumbling] [knocking] Frankie? Frankie, get off the roof. Frankie, get down here, gonna wake Evan up. I'm up. What's on the roof, Nora? He is. [tapping] Who's he? Frankie, Frankie, of course. You don't happen to know what he's doing on the roof, would you, darling? All I know is he lost his ring and now he's up on the roof. He's gonna break it, Evan. Mm-hmm. How is it that Frankie lost his ring on our roof? Frankie? Evan's coming up, you woke him up, Frankie. Frank! Frankie! Frankie. Wanna tell me what about you, buddy? There's no Frankie here. Just a loser. Might as well jump. Jump where? Jump off the edge of this building. Yeah? Well, you got four-five good feet there. Snow banks. Do you think she likes me? Who are we talking about, Frank? Angela. Angela, the one and only. I don't know. Of course, she likes you. I don't know. Come on. So she's talking about you, isn't she? So she's telling people how you're gonna get married? Hmm? I got a lot of problems, Evan. Yeah. So has everybody. You're supposed to look at the things you have. Ski-Doo. Truck, car. My dad got me all of that. Well, it's not what I meant, Frank. Drove in my little finger. Yeah? How did you do that? When I hit Boyd. See. See. You want me to hold it up for you? You're always doing things for me. It's a problem. You're always holding up my fingers when I get them shoved up and you're always checkin' over my Ski-Doo when it's not working and it's still not working very best. You're always bringing me moose meat. And then, deer meat. And I can't do nothing. I'm sure you can. What are you talking about, you can't do nothing? Angela, wanted a salmon, whole last year, who had to bring it? Angela wanted to see Square Forks that time, who had to show it to her? Who got lost in the woods, Evan? Who... who got lost that time? Trying to shoot a duck. Who got lost? I don't know who got lost. Who got lost? You did. -Who did? -You did. -You got lost. -I got lost. Yes. But... who had to come looking for me? I don't know, Frank, who? It was you, Evan. It was you. Don't you remember? Yeah, I remember. I'll make you a deal. If I ever get lost, you can come looking for me. I can? Okay, okay, okay... okay, okay, okay, okay... Oh, shoot. Okay, let me fix that finger. Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch. Okay, you're ready? Yeah, yeah, I'm doing it. Here it comes. Hah, didn't hurt a bit. Ouch, ouch, Jesus. Ouch. Okay, shh, shh, shh. Okay. Ha! I am afraid of heights, Evan. -You know that. -No, you're not. I am. Am I going to fall? -No. -Betcha I will. -Give me your hand. -No. Hey, Frankie, look. Your ring, Frankie. Look. 800 bucks, Nora. Whoa. Oh, oh, Frankie. Frankie, are you all right? Yeah, I had to come down anyway. What was wrong with the truck? Hmm, hah, just a wire not touching. Wasted all day. [coughing] Hello, Mrs. Trober. Hi, it's Nora. Delaney, hi. Listen, I was wondering if you're interested in any of my meat pies for Christmas this year. Well, if you didn't bake them yourself. Well, I wouldn't try that supermarket. Well, because the manager ruined 15 of my pies last year and he wouldn't pay me. No, it was... You know the one who looks like his face was just run over by a truck? No, no, you must know him, he's... fruity laddy. Talks through his nose all the time like he's... just hit over his head with a board. He's... ran for the Conservative Party, he's almost congenitally stupid. But if he... He is? He's your son, is he? Oh. Well, it's a coincidence, isn't it? [dog barking] Sure that's two cord? If it isn't two cord, I'm not taking it. I've enough to put up with... him, old drunk. Paula... come here, out on the porch. Well, you can pile it in the basement. Come here, out on the porch! Come on. [dog whining] Angela's got the diamond for Christmas. Show her, Angela. Well, I'll still be keeping my own name, that would be certain. To keep your own name, Nora? Dumb bitch. So cold you'd die in this old church, that's for certain. Frankie didn't even want me to come. Manger should've been up last week anyway. Would've been if the priest wasn't drunk half the time. Shh. Well, it's true. Manger should've up a million years ago if you ask me. He's always half-snookered. Almost dunked the little baby in the baptism fountain. Drowned it. My little nephew, Cory, almost drowned in his own baptism. [Angela] Why? Priest was drunk. We should've sued the entire Catholic church if that happened. From the Pope on down. Set for life, then. But he didn't drown. Pulled out of it in time. Well, ladies, are we all ready to go? Ah, yes, Father. [dog barking] All right, Paula. What's Santa Clause bringing in for Christmas, Paula? [dog wailing] Well, a doll or something. Thank you, Paula. Oh, that will go here. Don't you think, Brown? Some people are so darn kiddish, it's a wonder. Oh, we aren't putting the baby Jesus there. We are putting baby Jesus here. We did it last in the year before. Put the cow here, otherwise baby Jesus will be stepped on in no time. I know as much about taking care of babies as you do. Married four years and you don't even have any. Put baby Jesus where we put him last year. Oh! There you go, snookums. There you go, my snookum. Bring Jesus back. -No. -Angie. Bring Jesus back! No. You're being an insane person at this moment here, Angie. Bring it back. Give me it back. Angie! [Angie] Hey! Angie! Give it back. No! [Nora screams] Take your ol' baby Jesus North. Probably be the only one you ever have, anyway. Whoa! -Come here, come here... -Nora! You want to push me? I want to push you! -Come here. -Stop it! I've gotta piece of my mind for you, Angie. Get over here! She's gone bonkers! Run! [Nora] Come here Angie! [Priest] Remember where you are. -Ladies! -Dumb bitch. [Priest] No, stop, please, stop. [dog barking] Oh, well, you... just have to bring me more wood or take this away because this is not two face cord. It's two cord, ma'am. I don't call this two cord. I don't know what it is, actually. It's more than two cord, surely what it is. You can't fool me because I'm a woman. I'm not trying to fool you. Yeah, well. I guess you'll just have to let me pay you less than what we agreed on, or you can take this back and reload it. [sobbing] [sighing] [sniffles] Well, we could take this meg and we could... this wasn't broke off the cows house and we could tape it. Don't you think we can tape it? Now, we'll have to throw this little sheep in the garbage. Nora. It's going to be all right. Everything is going to be all right. I know it. [engine revving] [dog barking] [grunting] [grunting] Gee, you were a long time for a load of wood. No one took my wood. What? No one took my wood. Why? What do you mean? Just what I said. They said they didn't want it. [coughing] What are we gonna do? I promised mum $50 and... We haven't picked the turkey. We haven't even done that yet. Nora, would you just sit down without the old notebook, please? Jesus Christ. It's notebook this and notebook that. Just trying to keep a record of everything. Yeah, well. You can't keep a record of me. Don't... don't get upset. I didn't mean you... We'll get this racket figured out somehow. Did you break the cupboard? No. 'Cause if you broke the cupboard I'll have to figure $80 or $90 more in the notebook. [telephone ringing] Hello? Hi, Pete. Fine. Okay, just a sec. It's your Dad. Hey there, buddy. Yeah. Yeah. Just a sec. Do you want Dad coming down here and giving us Christmas presents? Well, how about we come up see you? Yeah. How's that? Okay, well, stay where you're at, alrighty. Good. [scoffs] Can't wait. Last year we got a pair of pennies with cheeks cut out of them. Year before that I got a skimpy see through nighty. Stuff that he thinks is gonna get me pregnant or something. He's just being nice. He's a good lad. Always thinking, that lad. Who knows... maybe this year he'll get you some sort of mechanical dick. [chuckles] [cats meowing] Huh, it's the best I could do on short notice. It should be open... just before Christmas. You know, sort of, say, like, uh, no later than tomorrow morning. This is youth, time he's trying to smother her off spring to his death. It's bad luck to badmouth a Christmas present, eh. -Don't like cats. -Who says it's cats? Seems like cats. Well, you don't know what it is until you open it. And you can't open it here, you gotta open it at home. So... I'm going back in before I freeze. Mind if I have a dope? Doesn't bother me what you put in your lungs, boy. Do you need any extra money for Christmas? No, we're okay. Nora, come and get yours. Open this one. It's a bra with tassels. I couldn't think of anything else. Oh. You gonna... put it on? Oh. No, I think I'll save this for a special occasion. Here, Dad. Thank you. He's getting crazier every goddamn year, isn't he? And you. Aren't you being just a bit puritanical, Nora? Do not want the cheeks out of your panties? Hey! He undid a brassiere out there on the road. In the night. He knew that she was that kind of girl. Because, although he'd never met her before. Ever. She was a stranger. But she had a tassel on her tit. And she wore a black cheekless pair of panties. Shut up. Yeah, it's edible ones. Mmm, that's what turned him on so much. She had a pair of Stanfield Premium new edible panties. Munch, munch, munch, munch... [woman] Just ignore them. Munch, munch, munch, munch... Munch, munch, munch, munch... Would you go around and see if anyone else wanna do it? Nah, burn it ourselves. Mookin up that wood stove after Christmas even if I have to punch holes through the walls. At least I would have saved on oil bills. Quit it. What's for supper? Meat pie. [on TV] Bard was a strength in the corner. [Nora] Christmas Carol is on the other channel. Yeah. Danny is channeled to win. To hell with that Bob Cratchit... Bored of him. Couldn't see him eating plum puddings, sobbing, hurt his spineless ribs. Huh? All right, Jesus mighty, Scrooge was king. Scrooge was always my man. Always went for Scrooge. Can we watch hockey? Mm-hmm. Nora, how long will you be standing on your head like that? I don't know. I'm supposed to be standing on my head so the sperm will be able to find its way. Some nurse told me to do. Oil and sperm is all I need. No job and blank sperm to go, somehow just ain't fair. You know a pre-proven way of doing things, too? Standing on your head? I don't know. You'd think this being a computer age and all where you could just program little suckers to go where they're supposed to go. You take the higher road, I take the lower road. That's all. Okay, who do you think is better? Orr or Gretzky? -[Nora] Gretzky. -[Evan] I'll take Orr. [Nora] You know, I'd take Gretzky over Orr but I'd take Lafleur over all of them. -[Evan] Lafleur? -[Nora] Yeah. [Evan] What about Douggie Gilmour? [Nora] Maybe... yeah. [church bells ringing] [knocking at door] [knocking at door] [cat meowing] All right, all right. [knocking at door] [knocking at door] Hold on! Hey there, Evan. Hello, Steve. What can I do for you? You still asleep? No, no... been up for hours. What's up? I don't know. Seems like you don't have any money in the bank. At least not in this account. So, where were you yesterday? Telephoned here all afternoon. I was up town. She was out. This is a cheque I wrote on a chainsaw? Yeah, but there isn't enough money in your account to cover it. [Evan] I don't understand that, Steve. I wasn't aware of the money in there but it's enough to cover a $60 cheque. Well, I just wanted to let you know. I had to drive down here, anyway. I mean, you can get back to me later on it. Yeah, uh, thanks. -I'm good for it. -Yeah. [engine revving] [sighing] Nora, have you, written a cheque, lately, on this account? On... 204188? I don't know if I wrote a cheque on that or not. Except for the tow truck, but that won't be cashed till tomorrow. Nora, if you don't pay these lads, then they stop working for you. I need that chainsaw to do some smelt fishing, so... it'd be nice if someone tells me that we have $200 in account 204188 that I could write a $60 cheque on it. I never said there were $200. I said there was $127 and 34 cents. If we don't have the money for the chainsaw, we don't have the money for the lumber. If we don't have money for the lumber, we don't have the money for the tow... Jesus, Nora... [church organ playing] [knocking at door] -Nora. -Hello, Father. Oh, I'm sorry for the... You're walking to the Church with that. I had to stop five times on my way to the Church. What is it? Pennies. Guinness World Book of Records pennies. I rolled them all. There's $50 worth of pennies here. $51 and 36 cents ones. What are you going to do with it? Well, I was wondering maybe you could buy them from me. I kind of had to get rid of them and if you gave me $50, then I promised Darnene... I promised mum that I'd give her $50. So, I was... I see. And you don't want to give her... pennies. No. I think she'd scream at me, you know, at all these pennies. I see. See, there's no banker to get to till tomorrow and tomorrow, I have to go up to town, and deliver all my meat pies, so there's just no way I could get the money tomorrow. -So today, I had to get her the money today. -No, I... don't need the pennies, I'll just give you the 50. No, no, no, you have to take them. Can't do that, you have to take all of them. [exhales] How's it going, boy? Uh, not too bad. Did you get something to eat? Uh-huh. Mom's up at the trailer, she could've made you a cup of tea and sandwich. I can make my own tea, darling. Besides, your Mom always gives me the evil eye every time I look at her. That's not true. She likes you a lot. Sure. I'm going out a little later again to... check on the beaver pond. Figure I'm gonna put a trap or two down the slide and see what happens. What about the money for the chainsaw yet? I sold off my pennies today. So I got Mom her money. Very best. That's what you want to do with your old Book of Records pennies I'm all for it. Then I have supper ready at 5:30 so if you can be back by then, gonna have the house all clean and tree done. Sure. Sure, darling. This dog is gonna bite all these old shrubs? That's why I'm building one more. Well, if you go trapping, be careful. I figured... I could sell these shells to half a dozen people in the summer. Anyways... you know I like building for free. [chuckles] Figure this year fits together as good as you and me, well, it ain't? How are you? How are you, Stinky? You did some good work there, beaver buddy. Huh? No one knows you're here but me. I thought you left the Dead Dam and left the country. Hah. Isn't it, boys and girls? You're gonna get me $80 or $90, aren't ya? [choir singing] 7:30, Evan. I work, bejesus, what do you want? My home in goddamn woods. Had to come the last two miles in the dark. Don't worry about it. You live just like old prime Dorby. Collect woods all the time. Well, he got bush fever and tore his clothes off. Mum, do you want gravy with meat potatoes or just with your meat or what? Oh, that gravy dear, I don't want gravy at all. My years of the gravy are over. Yes. Just like old Prime Dorby. They lost him somewhere. Prime Dorby was a damn fine man. There'll be no need to curse about it, Evan, cursing never solved anything. Evan sold off his wood today. So, we can give you $50 now. I never like to put you out. Putting aside, is she, Evan? I'm sorry as an urchin. Thank you, Evan. You're very kind to an old woman, Merry Christmas. Prime Dorby went wild and oft came as close. What was that, Evan? She'd, uh, marry Jesus. Finger's almost froze. Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts which we're about to receive from thy bounty. Through Christ, our Lord. Amen. [engine running] There. Bank of Montreal? Hello, is Gerald there, please?

You know, we got some stuff to do around here... decorate the tree and whatnot... but she's gonna make a run up there a little later today and put some money in the account. So, if you could just cover those checks till that... Two o'clock? 204188. Yeah. No... because you didn't cover them before. Really? I know it's not a lot of money, yeah. Okay. Yeah, Nora's gonna be up there a little later today. Alrighty. Good. She paid the goddamn oil bill. [kid crying] Sweety. Come here, okay. -Three pies for little missy. -Thank you. Okay. Thank you. [Christmas carols playing] Every Christmas, I hear the same damn thing. It's better than tupperware. Wrapping paper. Not in the bedroom. Evan's gifts. Closet in the bedroom. Well... that'd be nice. All right. There are your two pies. Thank you. One, two, three. Thank you, Mrs. Richards. She's gonna storm. Hundred, hundred and five, hundred and fifteen, hundred and twenty, hundred and forty. Hundred and forty. $140 in 204188. I'll keep this change here for myself. Or I should fill that up myself? It's all right. Sign here. Can you tell me my balance now? Of course. After you make this deposit, you'll still be overdrawn by $7 and 66 cents. Money's for you. Don't mind. Well, Nora should be on her way home now. All we need now is a beer. Hello, you stinky. He set that trap and hollered at his home, huh? What do you say to that? [whistling] [cracking] [ice cracking] [Evan] Jesus. [coughing] [grunting] Come on! [engine spluttering] [engine spluttering] [grunting] Oh, Jesus. [grunting] Come on. [engine spluttering] [breathing heavily] Okay. Figure it out. Come on. [engine spluttering] [grunting] [engine spluttering] Don't mind... have a nip. Hey. Let's wrap you. Help! Help! Anybody! [dogs barking] Come here, come here, buddy. Hey, come here... Hey! Here! [dogs barking] Shit. Oh, shit. [grunting] Jesus. It's okay. I'll light a candle. Evan says when you're stuck... in the winter... wilderness... light a candle. Okay. [grunting] What's up with the dogs down here? I don't want to be out too late on this thing, Frank. No, no. Okay. I'll just stay put for the time being. [engine revving] Frankie! Frank! Did Peter call Frankie? Frank! Frankie! Just brushed. You wanna go down and build a fire? Frank! Frankie! [Angela] I'm not an outside person Frankie! Frank! Let's go home and make a fire. Frankie! Help! Frank! Frankie! [grunting] [panting] [indistinct radio chatter] Hey, Nora. Hey, Nora. [knocking] What's happening, sir? Almost eight o'clock. Oh, Jesus, I don't know how I fit. Come on, I'll drive you home. Oh. Truck broke again, eh? Yeah. [sniffles] Oh, I have an open bottle of rum in my pocket. Suppose I tell you, should you be locking me up? Good, give it here, I'll have a drink. [chuckles] -Merry Christmas. -And to you too. Thank you. [wind howling] I don't know who should be shot, those dogs or Frankie, letting them run like that in the wild. Hmm. I think that was the first time I was scared of a dog. Can't remember ever being that scared of a dog before. Oh, it'll be good to get home, let them know you're all right. Yeah, certainly will. Looks like nobody's home. Hope he's not drunk with the boys on Christmas eve. Piss me off. He did that last year. -Good night, Nora. -Thank you. Bye. Evan? Evan? [screams] What the hell are you yellin' for? What the hell is this on the freezer? What the hell does it look like, it's a beaver. What the hell is it even there for? Oh, it's 'cause I didn't feel like walking down to the shed, darling. I was having a nice sleep. [sighs] Hey, hoo, hoo, give me that. You probably had plenty of that already. Um, not by half. I just got in, where the hell have you been? I don't know where. Truck broke down is all. So you got a beaver? Yeah, that's all I need. What could this be? I don't know, you have to open it. Hmm, can't tell by shaking it. No, you have to open it. It's something to open while you're in the tub here because I got better thing for later. Ooh. Cuff links. Just what I wanted. We'll never need any of those, darling. Look over, I'm coming in. I don't know you're gonna come to me like last night. Hmm, I don't know. Maybe. Hurry up, get in, don't splash. Okay, not splashing, move over. Move your leg. You had to walk home in the dark again today? Hmm, walking through, there's no problem. What about you? Stop flicking your toes under me like that. Well, you stop flicking your toes underneath me like that. Always flicking your toes. Your toes are getting provoked? Yeah, at least my toes didn't pay the goddamn oil bill. You wrote two checks and you didn't tell me about them. Yeah, turn that back. Hey, why don't you put bubble bath in here? Nothing.
