Bye! Don't wiggle. Did something bite you? Yes, the frame. Go faster, won't you? - Uphill and against the wind? It's hard! - It's always hard for you. We'll lose our chance! FROM THE CREATORS OF OUR FOLKS (SAMI SWOl) AND BIG DEAL (NIE MA MOCNYCH) LOVE OR LEAVE SCREENPLAY You're heavy. Maybe we should switch now? I won't reach the pedals, keep going! I'll keep pedalling and you'll keep talking, right? I want to sit on the frame now. There's not enough room for both of us. - Turn now! - Where? Here, take a shortcut, and we'll be home soon. You devil! I'll show you! May you die of thirst in a pool of water! Wladek, child, are you all right? Nothing's wrong. Talking to you is like threshing straw. You ride the bike. I'll walk on foot, it will be faster. Ride... GUEST STARRING ALSO STARRING Guys! Guys! I passed! - Zenek! I'm in! - Hurray! They turned down sixteen people, and I passed! I did it! Grandma! I'm in! - What is going on here? - Good news! Sure it's good news, but who told you? Kargul? Ania passed her exams and she's in! Of course. Thanks to my calculations. If we had forced Wicia to study, even though he didn't have a knack for it, Ania wouldn't have gotten additional points for social background. Well done, dear. Zenek, it's here. - It is? - So fine that you can't stop staring. - When? - Tomorrow morning. Let's go. - But you said tomorrow... - We have to celebrate it. Today! It needs to be done until some people fall under the table. But I haven't even got it yet. You'd make a TV career with your wit. Don't you see that here you pay in advance for what you will get? When he's stiff... Put sweet and coloured on the table. Go! Zenek! I'll explain later. - Remember! Sweet and coloured! - They won't appreciate it. The connoisseur has spoken. It's more elegant, and afterwards the headache lasts longer. - Are you asleep? - I am, don't you see? I made the deal. You've been drinking! It was business. - I had to... - Leave me alone. - Ania... - Ania? I'm not speaking to you! I have to think about our future, I do it for us. For us? For you! You never think of me. And why? Because you don't love me. - What is wrong with you? - Nothing. I'll show you how much I love you. Let me go! Zenek! Let go! What? Love me or leave me! - What was that? A thunderstorm? - It's just the couch. See? Ania was accepted, Zenek got what we had wanted... Maybe the birth rate will go up as well... Isn't he too drunk, huh? Mania, you're just like a policeman. A bed is not a motorcycle. Noone will get killed. And maybe our family will get bigger, God willing... - Kaźmierz... - What? We'll get a fine for destroying the environment. He has to drive in somehow. Besides it's my tree, I planted it myself. And you will pay the fine by yourself. Always against me, aren't you? - Is that him? - Uh-huh. What are you doing? Nothing... I will be sleeping downstairs. You can't do that, you made your vows. He made vows too, and look what he did yesterday. - A tractor is a treasure. - You can always borrow one. It's better to rely on yourself. That's exactly what I'm saying. Do you know why he didn't buy a car? Because he's jealous. He's jealous because he loves you. Loves me? He loves his tractor. I'll go on strike, and we'll see! Don't be a baby. What if he finds himself a strike-breaker? - I won't let him! - You will reconcile, I know it. Ms Anna Pawlak? Registered letter from America. An invitation? I'm going! I'm going! What's all this? The ceiling is almost collapsing downstairs! - She's going to America! - Who? This is for you. Probably another invitation. Oh dear, he's taken so much trouble... It's a trouble for him and for us. It's a bad time right now, harvest's just begun, lots of work ahead... He writes that he would like to see us. He misses us, eh? Why not, we can meet. Grandma! We're going! What? Over my dead body! I mean, he may come and visit us. We have a lot to show. - I'm going to America. - Oh dear God. - Jaśko is inviting me. - But he has always hated you. That was in the 1920s. Fools hated the wise then. - Now everyone is equal. - My dear... Pawlak was invited so many times and hasn't gone even once. Maybe it's better for Poland, he's too short to be exported. - He's got what he wanted. - And she wanted to buy a small car. And I will buy it when I'm back from America. What? - What is this? - An invitation from USA. - Show me. - No! - Show it to me! - No, let me go! - You're not going anywhere. - Yes I am. Alone? No way! Never! She's not going alone. I'm going to America too. What did you say? Another Columbus. - I'm going to America! - On your wagon? I have an invitation. Suddenly you're such a tourist, eh? I received many invitations, another one today, but I'm not so eager to go there. I'm more cultured. When someone invites me, I don't refuse. Well, well, a cultured peasant. Who's going to invite you there? Jaśko has already done it. You've lost your mind. It was you who drove him away, and now you use him to go there? - He sent it himself! - Why would he do that? Maybe he wants to see one of his own. May you never find your way home... Do you think we have no one better to send abroad than such an old goat?! - It's not your money that pays for it. - But Jaśko is my family. What stops you from going there? What a cuckoo... Why would I go there? - I want to see the world. - With my brother's money! He wants to see a relative. A relative? You? - You're not a member of our family! - Yes I am, and I'm going! Such a disgrace, sending such a... tassel out in the world! Somebody hold me, or I'll lose it! Pawlak, don't you start again! You started one war in the past. And it's time to end it! Let me go, you! Be careful! The tractor! Run! "In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit." Amen. "I greet you and ask how you've been, I wish to see you all to sum up my life before you and show you my legacy. My house had a great past so it has to have a similar future, and this future will start in July." - In July? - "...start in July." "On this occasion I wish to invite each and every one of you." "Please bring some wholemeal bread the kind that our mother used to bake." Let me see. Wait. That's Jaśko. - Look at this Chevrolet. - And a two-storey house. See? He's inviting everyone. Why does he want to spend so much money? Maybe he's a millionaire! Kaźmierz, we have to write today that we're not going. What did you say? I can't deny my brother's wish to eat Polish bread. - So, are we all going? - All? Everyone's leaving and the house will be grieving. - There's so much work, and the livestock... - The harvest... That's what you have your machines for. American way of thinking! I'm taking you with me. We'll decide after the harvest who goes. Meanwhile, bring the tractor out in front. Go, go... Left, left, good... Whoa! Stop! Grandpa! A TV set? I want him to know we have a colour one. But in the window? What's happening? A fire in the house? Bring that Robin over here. - Grandpa, it's not ours! - But we will have one. Right, only if I earn some money abroad. - Do you know how it works? - Sure I do. What's taking so long? Anielcia is putting her best dress on. We can wait. Kaźmierz, look! They look like Calvarian beggars! Stunned, huh? You have to think ahead! Wladek, we were to show our prosperity, and you want to sabotage this? We will show them our countryside. In these old rags? Look at my family! Kazimierz looks like an American President. Forget American style, we're taking there what they don't have. Don't fuss and take your best clothes, like you were going to a wake! - Let's not show off with our wealth. - Better yet to act like beggars? Do you want people to start gossiping? But it will remind them of Kruźewniki. Say "cheese"! Take good care of Ania! Zenek! - What's wrong with you? - Well, everyone is crying, so... Maybe she's leaving Poland for good, but Jaśko paid for us both ways. - He can afford it. - True, he's got it all. Fabulous life! - Wait, where are our bundles? - The steward has taken them. - Where? - To the cabin. - And who let him do that? - Kaźmierz, wait! Wait, it's mine! I'll help you to your room. That won't be necessary. Thank you kindly. He shouldn't be allowed out around people. Grandpa! - Spaghetti alla Milanese. - Very well. - Indian poached eggs please. - At your service. - This! - I see. Me and my granddaughter will take the same. Of course. Fabulous life! - Do you need anything, sir? - I was just looking, sorry. It's your fault that God tortures me with all this luxury! I have nothing against luxury. Do you remember the luxury of 1945? We travelled in one carriage with animals. At least I could talk to them. And here? - A savage! - Grandpa, stop it! How greedy. I hope he chokes. It's because of them our family is scattered all over the world. He's got a grudge against a cripple for having healthy children. What's you problem? "In the name of Christ, curse this damn Kargul..." Kaźmierz! Who wrote that, huh? Jaśko! If America is a heaven, then the road to it is full of thorns. There's no work because Black people work for small wages. - They're as numerous as ants. - Racism has no future. You have to think politically, but you always blame everyone else. Because I am a real Pole. What's politics got to do with the fact that I prefer gray from bay horses? A man is not a horse. It's nice to hear someone smart. You can ride a horse, but with a man... You can only trip over. Eat, it's been paid for. I can't. Every time I look at it... I feel sick. What does he want from us? It means something great. - Would you like some tea or coffee? - Ice cream! The "big deal" ones! Speak like a human being, don't gobble like a savage. - What should I bring then? - Well, everything. I wanted to help. It would be easier for two people and I would kill time. But no! Selfish bumpkin! He wants money. Mania must have milked the cows already. Take a seat. Don't look! - Where are you going? - To lie down there. What for? You're not sick. What did I do to be punished like this... We're doing this for our family. I know what's good for my family. Look! He stuck to her like a leech. You should watch her, one million people are kidnapped yearly in United States. - On what grounds? - On the grounds of kidnapping. Statistically most incidents take place on Mondays. Are you a professor? I worked in a news-stand, I know a lot. Saturdays: Highest number of car accidents, Sundays: Attacks of drug addicts, Mondays: Kidnappings. Blacks are most aggressive on Tuesdays, the mob on Wednesdays, and Thursday is a day of rapes. In New York alone there are over 4000 rapes a year. How do people live there? Stay at home and never carry any money. Unless it is well hidden, like this. My mother used to do the same, when she went to the market. Do you have a lot of money with you? No, my brother is picking us up. And my fiancée is picking me. Ania! Come here, child. You prance like some maid in front of barracks. I'm just practicing my English! Don't get a pimple on your tongue! Don't you have a family to practice with? Do you think I'm deaf? That I don't understand his black language? Cover yourself, it's cold. You hit the jackpot! No, I just pulled. And you won money. What are looking at? Haven't you seen dollars? You don't even have to count them, pays like a bank. Remember who hit the jackpot. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. When is it going to end? Go back to hell you demon. It's worse than bombardment. Wladek? Are you alive? Oh, you are. I thought maybe... What are you doing? Give me that. You can't swim. Grandpa! Where are you going? To clean my soul. Holy Mother of God, let us happily arrive and see Jaśko there. Is the priest coming? In a minute, he's changing. Father, I... - What's with you? - It's the end of the world! Look! I think we're in hell. I'm getting off! We're in America! I feel like a village head now. High above, full, and not responsible for anything. It's late, time to land. Jaśko will not wait forever. Michigan lake is below us. We've been circling over Chicago for 2 hours. We've been kidnapped! There's a strike on the airport... Planes cannot land. - How do you like your America now? - Fabulous life! They work when they want to, if not, they don't work. That's democracy! And because of their democracy I have to fly around here forever? I came to see Jaśko, not to enjoy some merry-go-round. We're landing! Temperature 90 degrees. What? As hot as hell. But that's in Fahrenheit. The exchange rate in Poland must be in this Favrenheit too. Is that him? So many people... - Grandpa? - What grandpa, you're my fiancée! Excuse me? - She's married. - To you? For the long run? God forbid. Steve? It's me. That is very nice too. I'll tell him off for treating his own brother like this. Your family. - We have to make a call. - Where to? Grandpa John (Jaśko). And I don't even have a cent. - Well? Open this pouch of yours. - Come on. - Well? - There's no signal. - Half of our cash is gone. - Don't you know how to count? Did we just lose all our money? It's my money and I can do what I want with it. There's no one home. Nothing left but to sit down and cry... - Has Jaśko sent him? - No, he says there's a club... We can sign in for two dollars... Oh, and to support marijuana and gay rights. Let him find someone more stupid than himself. Hop on, we can give you a lift! What's the address of this brother? Where does he live? It's written down here. I know this place. It's, at the uh... North-West. See this big building over there? It's Sears Tower. There was an architect, Anthony Rechalski. He went from rags to riches, he's now in a steel company, in Board of Directors. You mean that he's a manager? And started as a lift operator, right? In Poland people can also go high up in their career. And this is John Hancock Centre. 1107 feet high. It's a kind of a big house in the world. I bet they have the biggest bees around here too. - They can build real high. - The higher you get, the harder the fall. That's clever. Here you have banks where you get money without using a machine. No wonder they get robbed if the thieves are tempted so much. In Poland there was a bank robbery too. But only one. Because we have only one bank. This is America. A lot of competition. Here a man's position is important. You can be a president or a gangster, but you have to be somebody. This relative of yours... What does he have? He has a house. This is not exciting. Middle class... All middle-class people have a house. I'll tell you how it is. You have a high middle class, a middle middle class, ...and a low middle class. - What did you say? He was talking about middle class. Talking about different classes... Our society is classless. - Copernicus! - In Warsaw there is an original monument. Big deal, this one is the biggest. Here everything is the biggest. The biggest buildings, the most cars in the world, the fastest pace of life. In America everything is the fastest, the best, the biggest. Excuse me, have you been to Kruźewniki? Who, me? No... He lives here, in this neighbourhood. Apparently he didn't marry a rich woman. My brother left his girl back home and he never married. She was cross-eyed. He could have found himself a better one here. - Maybe your Anielcia is better? - Grandpa! Grandpa, look! He's at home, that's his car! - Where? - Over there! Here we are. - Take it. - Stop bossing around. It's a democratic country. Still someone has to run the business. - Tell that to John. - Don't you worry. - I'll tell him a thing or two. - Grandpa! You can't do that. You're right. Make sure that I don't tell him too much. - Thank you again... - See you around! Goodbye! Thanks a million! I didn't know he is such an artist. He's just a... middle class. You don't have any class at all. Does Jan Pawlak live here? Yes. Are you the funeral people? No. We came from Poland. From Poland? Please come in. Jaśko! He won't hear you. Jasiek asked me to deliver it personally. We've been waiting so long for you to come here. Soil... He said he'd brought it from home. He didn't even greet us, and now we have to say goodbye to him. - Where is my brother now? - At the funeral home. The funeral is in two days. - There will be no funeral. - Kaźmierz, what are you saying? We'll find a better place for him. Next to our mother. When he was leaving Kruźewniki, he prayed to be buried with his family. What's this for? There's a recession. Turn off this rubbish. We have ten channels here. Per person? That's terrible. We have to drink. For the peace of his soul and of our hearts. He was waiting for three things. This bread, you, and the opening. - What opening? - Of this house. I discovered that in 1893... Paderewski... Who? Paderewski, the pianist, practiced in this very house. And John wanted to bequeath it to the community of Polish Americans. - Do you hear this? - We will respect his last wish. The testament is with Mr. September. - A lawyer? - Yes. He's waiting for you. We didn't come here for money. - What's this? A raid? - It's the police. What do they want? It started! Tomorrow it will be in the newspapers. And tonight on television. We have to go back home. But we've just arrived. What are we supposed to do here? Jasiek's gone. But this is America! Too much to see. Only a fool is not curious about the world. And you are the smart one, huh? What is that you like here so much? This? Stupid machine. Or maybe this? You can't open it, neither see through it. This? Or this? - What's this? - Stereophonic sound. Stereophonic or not, that was my cow! No, Kaźmierz, that's my Mućka. And perhaps this is your stallion, huh? - Ania! - What? No, Jaśko recorded that at your baptism. My livestock and your voice. I feel at home now. Of course there are many paragraphs, I will read out the most important ones. That means he gives his house, in which Paderewski lived and worked, to Polish Americans' community as "Polish Culture Centre." It means rest of his estate and savings will be given in half to Kazimierz Pawlak, a Polish citizen, and the other half to Miss Shirley Gladys Wright, born in Detroit in 1957, my... illegitimate... daughter. What's that again? And as my last will I ask my brother, Kazimierz Pawlak, to find my daughter. - That's a mistake. - No, you have to divide the inheritance. Between the two of us? No. Between Kazimierz Pawlak and... Miss Shirley Gladys Wright. - What? - Am I hearing right? - Strange, she's your family. - What family? My dear God... That's a con. Grandfather didn't have any daughter. True. Never in his life... Truly... Never... He was never married, how could he have a daughter now? - "Lllegitimate." - Exactly. That means parents were not married. It's true, grandpa. You better learn American first. What a disaster... My dear God... "Born in Detroit..." I have an aunt! That's America for you! Mr. Pawlak. The ring. - What ring? - He bought it for Shirley's mother. - Why didn't she take it? - The testament does not say. Nice legacy your brother left us. Where are you going? - I'd like to see the priest. - He's in the building next door. Come. Very good. Now "Jasieńku". What do you want from a priest? We have to help Jaśko find his way to heaven. He'll use some help, a bachelor with a child... And God himself? Forgive me Lord. He was also a bachelor. So? The Lord is the Father of us all. Some of us are grown-up but still stupid. Let's go. Excuse me. We're going back home after the funeral. What's the hurry? We have to find her. - Less people to share. - Is it your money to share? She's entitled. She's a Pawlak. Sure. Shirley Gladys "All-Right". OK, let's take a break. Are you here to see me? No, we are looking for the parish priest. That's me. I'm really sorry. We came here to... Make an offering, for a mass, in the memory of Jaśko Pawlak, my brother. - What's the name again? - Pawlak. John Pawlak. He wasn't a member of my parish, was he? It's about the soul, not the bureaucracy. When we come back home, we will make an offering there as well. And this is a separate intention. For finding our niece. And what is her name? Um... I forgot. Shirley something. She's from Pawlak family too. They will know in heavens who it is about. I just wanted to say this is a parish of the Polish National Church. Catholic. You know this, right? You have money for some girl, grandpa, and I can't even afford a coke. Come here Pawlak. Sign this. $2,500. Funeral and cremation. - For how many people is this cremation? - Just one. Grandpa thinks you mean a wake. No, this is a total cost of the funeral. - Sign it. - There will be no funeral. I won't leave Jaśko on some foreign land. You don't know this land yet, Pawlak. The Polish cemetery. - Where are the graves? - Here. What about the tombs and crosses? Only in the older part of the cemetery. Nowadays people are buried like this. So the lawn-mower could operate. Over the heads of the deceased? He chose this place himself. Grandpa! Come here! Look! - Our folks... - You've changed your mind already? You said it's a foreign land. Where our sweat and our cows are... It's not foreign anymore. Jaśko wanted us to find his daughter. Is it worth it? We don't know what kind of a seed we may find. I need a radio announcement. No, not a commercial. It will take us half an hour. You will speak on the radio. See? That's America! Like we don't have radio stations in Poland. But in Poland you have to listen, and here you can speak. Look right! The tallest building in the world, the Sears Tower. Before that the tallest one was in New York, the Empire State Building. And now Chicago has the tallest one. A Pole was one of the constructors. Why do you take those? For my nerves. Wouldn't you rather lead a quiet life? See? There's another graveyard. That looks like a more suitable place for Jasiek. No, no, it's not for him. Why? Is it expensive? For me, family is worth more than money. Pull over. Remember, Milwuakee Avenue. But you need to go well dressed there. Mr. Jurkiewicz sends t-shirts with the Polish Eagle emblem. 6.5 dollars for adults, 5 for kids. How can you talk about kids when you're out of energy? Stop despairing, start using monks' herbal balm. Pawel Kotula is the man to buy them from. When you use this balm, you'll be able to sing my song: Oh yes, I did sing it and how! Let's refresh our memories with my old album. Now we can talk... My dears, I'm a patriot, but you need to be quick on air. Time is money. My station reaches the ears of 1 million Polish immigrants. With this rooster, I wake up thousands of Polish kids. - Who'll do the talking? - I don't know... Maybe all of us? No, in this country you speak only when you have something to say. Miss, forget the radio. You'd make a career with me on TV. Mark the words of old Joe. We're coming back on air. Touching, isn't it? Beautiful... I cry when I listen to this album. Forget the sentiments, let's earn some cents. We'll drop a real bomb now. Our guests from Poland, fresh import, like the fresh mushrooms doctor Paul has just stocked in his shops End Center. Sliced, 8 ounces, 7.29 USD. Eat Polish mushroom only. Really, so many penny buns in Poland... You heard the man, go pick your mushrooms in Poland. When you go, travel arrangements can be made at the Capital Travel Office. And now, our guests from Poland... You came two days ago and are looking for a relative, right? Not much of a relative... It is I, Kazimierz Pawlak, from Poland. Can you hear me, Shirley? Tomorrow is your father's funeral. John is the name. Right after that, we're going back to Poland. We hope you get to see the entire family. I came here with my granddaughter, Ania. And with my... with Wladyslaw Kargul. Ania, say something. Aunt Shirley... We'd love to meet you. Don't forget about the funeral, and the estate to inherit. Inherit my ass. We are looking for Shirley Gladys Wright... née Pawlak. You crazy? She's illegitimate. I can't stand it. Don't make me show my backhand swing. Don't start, like Jasiek did in the past. You were the one who pushed him out to America. And then you were the first to take the horse. - I was a pioneer. - A pioneer... with a cat on a string. Cat? Cat makes me think of fur. Best furs can be bought from the Murdock brothers' warehouse. Polish blood, hot temper, strong like a wind in the highlands. The only thing you can't buy canned. It's all from your Joe today. Tomorrow will be even more beautiful. The sun will shine, and so should you. I'm bankrupt, I'm finished. All my prestige is gone. Smile, tomorrow will be a better day. Excuse me, will we find her? You fought for your family like a lion. Will we find Shirley, Mr. September? Call me Wrzesień. I became September, as even my sergeant in the army couldn't pronounce my name. And that's my Junior. He can't pronounce "Wrzesień", either. Yet, he's chief engineer at Panasonic. A greatjob. I want to do something for you. Show you around Chicago. Thank you. Can you find Shirley? OK, I'll try for you. How do you like America? Thank you. How many bisons do you really have? 100, 200? And how many TV channels? Many channels, one TV. I'd like to invite you to a game of cards, to our club on Saturday. No, they can't do that. They're already invited to a wedding. - Whose wedding? - Mine, ours! - Where? - At White Eagle. Where is it? The same place where we're meeting for the funeral meal, today. I'd like to buy a farm in Poland. I hear you have a lot land over there. State Agricultural Farm has more. - How much is the entire SAF? - It's state-owned. I have nothing against your state... but they should keep the commies away from power. Kazimierz... come over here. It's time we started. Let's wait, Shirley might still come. - But she knows nothing about it. - We promised to find her. No need to see her here. Thank God thousands of people go missing in America each year. Children, quiet. We need to start. Let's wait a few more minutes. They might still find her. How much is a marble tombstone in Poland? - Well, the official state price... - No, with bonds of the National Bank... With dollars. Dollars? How should I know? The death of Jaś wasn't counted with dollars. Would you find a good graveyard plot for me in Poland? Kind man, willows, jasmines, odorous elder, nightingales singing... that's real eternal rest, unlike here. One foot of land, how much? What funny words they invented here... feet, Fahrenheit, pounds, cremation. Small wonder it's hard to communicate. - Is Shirley here? - She will be. - Doctor Paul... - Who? Doctor Paul, he sold all the mushrooms. The Travel Office has 1,200 orders for trips to Poland. Let's get in. We'll sign a contract... - Hold on... - You'll repeat the show. - What's this about? - I'll pay. - In dollars? - Cash! - How much? - We'll negotiate. You haven't been to Poland a while. Sometimes we argue... but we don't do it for money. We do it for real. Grandpa, we don't you do it for real, and for real money? - I'll do it. - How greedy... My soul can barely stand the pain and you... who taught you this? This could be Shirley... - How are you feeling? - Thanks for showing kind interest. - And this is...? - My wife. Good afternoon. I can't wait any more. The next client arrives in half an hour. It's God's will to begin... Let's go. Sweet Jesus, our Lord, let him rest in eternal peace... Let us pray... God, it's Thy grace that allows souls of the departed find eternal peace. We beseech Thee, sanctify this grave in Thy mercy. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, in hope of the Resurrection with our Saviour, our Lord. We commit the body of our brother, Jan, to eternal life, amen. Oh Lord, let him rest in eternal peace... - It's Shirley! - Finally. Where? Sweet Jesus... Take this. It's medicine. Jasiek, what have you done to us? As if we didn't have enough trouble in Poland. A coloured human is still human. Coloured, you say... Not that I want to cause her pain, but there won't be much boasting when we get back to Rudniki. Don't drink too much... I need to relax. I suffered quite a shock! Execute the will, and let's get back home. There's some will we have here. Who got it into Columbus' head to discover America? Yes, the balk. You don't understand? Listen up... This is Pawlak's plot of land. Understand? Kargul ploughed his land... ploughed, "oral", understand? "O-R-AL" "Oral" the field... Understand? And your daddy grabbed the scythe... "K-O-S-A" over the field... And with this scythe, he hit Kargul over the head... Understand? And your dad had to... How much did he plough? Three fingers. Oh, the illiterate lot. It wasn't that much! How much was it, eh? Yes, possible. You don't remember? You can stuff blacks with bullshit, but not me. If Jasiek was alive he would refresh your memory. He left for America, and all that's left is the shame of past mistakes. It's you who made him wander off... And now you dare speak of past mistakes?! Now get the hell out of my America! Since when is it yours? - Since my family's been buried here. - You better get back to you black girl. Now little grandpa and big grandpa... they don't argue at all. Grandma Marynia, grandma Anielcia. And that's my Zenek. How dare you... Never in your life... I'll kill you... Grandpa! She's watching all this! You what? Grandpa, I told her you live in harmony, - that Poland sees no conflicts... - That's true. - That socialism means equality for all. - She believed you? Just watching for now... No arguing from now on, you hear me? This is a political matter now. Anyone can get unlucky with kids. It's just a shame John didn't choose a woman of different colour to give him babies. If I'd known you were such a rascist, I wouldn't have brought you with me. The physical resemblance with Jasiek is striking. If I were half-blind, I might even notice that. Why do you always question me? Once, we painted a pig black to turn it into a wild boar. The other way around? Lmpossible. - She's wonderful. - What do you know about her? Pawlak has invited her here, and what if she is a thief or a lunatic? She's an orphan. Is she baptised? - Turn off the lights. - Do it. Let's get back home. And you were just saying how you love their democracy! What kind of democracy is it, if it allows everyone to have an opinion. What matters is people's feelings, their thoughts. In order to persuade anyone, you need to listen to them, first. Right, grandpa? Wise words, very political. Still, you need money to achieve it. In Poland, somehow they manage without. But this is America... and I don't have a dollar to invite Shirley to the movies. Are you nuts, Kazik? Tomorrow's Thursday. - So what? - Did you forget that on Thursdays they rob and rape here? Shirley, try this. Polish bread. Good? Bring in some tea. - Ania wants to make her a Pole. - What's the point? I'm executing my brother's last will. He wanted Kaśka to join the family. You've become "Kaśka" now. - That's some name you gave her. - What, a wrong choice? She can't forgive grandpa John for not marrying her mother. But he wanted to! Ltjust didn't work out. Look, the engagement ring... he wanted to give it to her mother. Well done, Ania. You dumb ass, even socialism wasn't built in a day. Be careful. How long does it take to get divorced in Poland? I don't know, we never practised that in our family. - Here, it's a swift process. - What are you... Wrzesień, have you gone mad? Pawlak, give me a break... - My daughter married a Dutch man. - It's no sin... but it's shameful. Take it. Grandpa, can I talk to you for a minute? - I want to go up town. - Why? To buy a bag for myself, and a pair ofjeans for Zenek. - And he knows the shop. - But you have clothes, what's the point? Grandpa, I can't return in the same clothes. - Get your hands off... - Alright, I can manage by myself. I hope this choco girl won't mess with Ania's head. Shirley's gone. She no longer lives here. - What do we do now? - We'll find them both. We should've returned after the funeral. There would be no collaboration with the savage girl. Ania learnt all this American freedom from her. The police will find her. There'll be some use of the police for once. Our family have always solved problems by ourselves. She's not much of your family. A family from hell... You know, we will soon be passing by the Hancock Center, the fifth tallest building in the world. 1,007 feet. Look, the Sears Tower on the right, the tallest in the world... A Pole helped to build it. What did they do to deserve this? In Poland, at least they don't arrest horses. Time to go home... What will you have, gentlemen? - Vodka, straight. - OK. When she served on "Batory", she still remembered Polish. Those newly arrived are more American than the Americans. All we need to do is spray the window, and we have a success. No reason to dramatize. Junior will find Ania... even if she's moved to Hollywood. Tell me... Which song was John's favorite? We'll play it to please him. - But he's dead. - This song will bring us closer to him. What did he like? What... did... he like? "Oh, my rosemary... blossom." Something like that. Don't you remember how he sang in Kruźewniki: "Oh, my little girl, I loved you so discreetly, I wanted to have fun, but got you pregnant quickly." You moron... you came here to embarrass me? Why are you so spiteful? Jasiek would turn in his grave. Leave your venom for the choco girl. If it wasn't for ther, I would've gone home long ago. Blacks are a problem here. They want to settle scores on their own. Rascism is something I can't comprehend. It's because you don't have minorities. Try handling the majority. You don't know local Poles. When will you start thinking in historic terms? There are no domestic and foreign Poles. They are just clever and dumb Poles. We have our Celsius, you've got the F-guy. Still, the temperature is the same. Who's there? Ania, my child, where have you been? Why would you have to earn, when we have the inheritance money? And what are you doing? What? I can't hear you. I work in an office... Which one? At Pepsi-Cola. We have the grand opening here. Me and the other grandpa are so confused... I won't cause problems, really. I'll be back right on time. Hello, can you hear me? Something's broken, see? They'd get the same bruises in Poland, if they chose to work as ticket controlling inspectors. You'd better think what to do now. Maybe it's Ania. - And? - Nothing... I've searched high an low. We need to call the police. What can they do about it? - There she is! - Ania? Shirley... Which one? Oh yes! Run, Shirley! - My true blood! - They're acting. It's not for real. - They're professionals. - Like everything else here. - It's the Chicago Hall. - Chicago? Let's go. Right now! What's going on? We need to walk from here. It's Columbus Day! - Is this a parade or what? - I guess... What's this feast? This is no May to have one. Let's cross the street. Grab my hand! Follow me... We're lost. Excuse me. Come here! Damn, let him stay after all. Sweet Jesus... He just stayed there. There he is! Jump over here! God, he's stone deaf! Excuse me... Come on! Stay there, stay. I hope he won't lose his way. Our people are here. Ania, get down! You'll regret it, if you don't come back home! You can have whatever you want in Poland. Can you own a gun? Why would you need it? The times when I had to keep grenades or a rifle are long gone. - A broken rifle, that is. - You should be thankful. If it had worked, you'd never visit America. The Sears Tower. It was built by a Polish engineer, Michalski. There, nothing but the glass. The tallest bank in the world. Built by a Pole. Say "Kościuszko". How about "Pulaski"? Oh, another Pole. Kopernik. - She's a clever girl. - Making a Pole out of her? Miss Pawlak, yes. - I don't understand. - Do you have sex shops? What for? She says that sex means freedom. Freedom like that? Everyone has it at home in Poland. Do you have rollerskating in Poland? I mean, the game... - Of course. - Bullshit! How do you perceive capitalism? With God's help, it's all in the past. She says that here we need to destroy capitalism, and suggests we all go to a shop now and take something without paying. How can you do such a thing? It's shop-lifting. - She's your true blood. - When you steal from them, - you make them weak. - You be quiet. We still have some talking to do at home. Do you want to take her to Poland with you? Yes! What if she decides to liberate state farms? Dear God, liberate from what? We need to reach some understanding... OK! - Hello, how are you today? - Hi! Please, join us inside! - There, the vice-governor. - Even our enemy from the Senate! Welcome, welcome! Move, hurry! I'm Robert September, the head of lawyers at September and Associates, a law firm that drove this initiative to its successful conclusion. He is now presenting. I ask myself a question these days: Who am I? Where do I come from? We don't wish to be rootless Americans. The fact that we're meeting today is the best proof that you can be a good American and still stay in touch with the Polish soul. This house shall reunite us all! Origins, customs, tradition... Wait here. I'll be right back. ...it's what we call a family... Hold on, hold on. This is a historic... - Dis is... - This is. That's what I said... Dis is... THIS is a historic moment. Oh God. A house that hosted... master Paderewski. I openly declare... I declare open! - Open? - Correct! - And welcome our dear guests. - You see? I'm no good at this. - You need to learn, see? - Understand the words, first. I'd do that in no time. You? First of all, stop drinking. Grandpa, it's started already! What are we going to do now? Bring another shirt. You heard about this family from me. My radio station greatly contibuted towards this moment. My sponsors support you, too. That's why everyone present today will receive a 5 for all the merchandise advertised on my radio station. After we conclude, let us all meet outside. Huge travel offices, great companies, people enjoying high social status. We need to come out excellent there. All soaking wet. No replacement? Excuse me, can I...? Remember, you need to say, Zis is a historic moment. "Zis is"? How can you speak like that? It's all about the looks. I can't go out looking like that. It is a great honor for my company, Continental Travel Office, to participate in this ceremony. That's why we sponsored the buffet. Remember that my company is one of the sponsors of Joe's radio show. Don't forget to thank everyone for coming over. This is a memorable moment... We all want our kinds to visit the homeland one day. The palaces, churches, graves of our ancestors... But we all drive cars. We all visit dangerous districts. Don't let accidents, fatal accidents that can happen to anyone, prevent your kids from visiting the homeland. - Stick to the script. - What? The script! Let's thank vice-resident of D.S. Company, an insurance company, for his speech. Now's the time for the brother of our founder to speak. Let's cheer for our guest from Poland. Welcome! Dis is a histeric... Jasiek... Jan Pawlak, my brother. I remember stories about his work in the steel company. He would mark his route with chalk, so he could get back home safely. And then, the 50 years in America... Now he is a local here... He visited us only once, when Ania was baptised. All he took was a little sack filled with Polish soil... Just this and nothing else for himself... I'd like to say a few words about Jasiek, who was a humble man and during his life he wasn't much spoken of. And even now... you're so silent. But he was an exceptional Pole. - Father... - What? - I want to change my family name. - We already did that once. I chose to be "Wrzesień" again. My dear Jasiek, when you were leaving Kruźewniki, you prayed to God that we would lie side by side when the time comes. I won't leave you alone here. The air-conditioning doesn't work. Look what she gave me. Rolling well? If I'd known what would happen out there, I'd never have left the house. If America hadn't found me, you'd never get to see how far our Poland can reach out. I wonder what Mania got from her. What's this? A pretzel? Help yourselves. Long time away from the homeland, sirs? True! Thank you very much. - There've been huge changes recently. - Really? That can't be! We'll get used to it somehow. What are we going to say at home? We survived the Sanation and liberation after the war. With God's help, we'll survive America, too. They help me relax. Ladies and gentlemen, we will be landing at the Warsaw airport in just a few moments. Please, return to your seats, fasten your seatbelts and refrain from smoking. The temperature in Warsaw is now seven degress Celsius... Local time, 9 a.m. English text - Katarzyna Gącerz, Bartosz Lewandowski ROBOTO TRANSLATION
