I have $423.88. and it has taken me three years to save that up. Four hundred dollars times 25. That's, um... Ten thousand. Ten thousand. Five thousand would be your half.

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to this, our 33rd day of racing. Our feature race of this afternoon will be the 41st running of the $50,000-added Santa Clarita handicap for fillies and mares. Your attention, please. Here are the changes in this afternoon's racing card. In the first race... What if he don't show up? You keep asking the dumbest questions. Why don't you try answering your dumb questions once in a while. Okay. What if he don't show up? That is the dumb question. Now, what's the dumb answer? Well, if he don't show up... I-I guess we can't grab him. You see? You don't have to ask all those dumb questions. I got it right? Certainly, and if you just think a little bit, you'll come up with all the right dumb answers. But if he don't show up-- I got a hunch he will. But if he don't, do you think maybe he's gonna tell somebody about us doping the horse? A little louder and he won't have to. Sorry. I think maybe... Do me a favor. Oh, Binky-- Quit thinking for a while, will you? I'm liable to lose my temper and tear your tongue out by the roots. If I promise not to think, can I say something? Yeah. I think I seen him. Where? Over there. I don't see him. He ain't there now. Well, where the hell is he? How would I know? Which means you just asked a dumb question, so if you think about it a little bit-- Stick out your tongue. No. Do as I tell you. Stick out your tongue. Ew! Ew. What was he wearing? I think a sweater. What color was it? I think-- I think yellow. Think yellow? I think. What else did he have on? Nothin'. What do you mean, nothing? From the waist down? No, I mean I couldn't see. Binky! Bink, Bink, Bink, Bink. I saw him. I'll get you! Thank you. Told you a yellow sweater. Okay, you gotta do something to attract their attention. I gotta? So I can place the bet. They're after you, so you're the perfect attention attractor. You really don't care if I get killed. I don't want anybody getting killed, starting with me. Okay. All right, all right. Oh, boy. Oh... If I don't survive, pay for the funeral out of my half. No, no, nothing elaborate. Oh, and whatever's left give to the Screen Actors' country home. Okay. You want my car? You can have my car.

And would you like to pay for it by check or cash? Just-- Just how much are we talking about here? Ten thousand. Come on, sweetheart. Isn't that a little bit high? Well, I'm not really qualified to say. Well, if you're not qualified-- Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I don't think that you two are talking about the same thing. Well, what are you talking about? No, no, what are you talking about? The piano. What piano? The one Mr. Powell just purchased. What? I was afraid of that. What are you talking about? I bought a piano, Spence. When?

You're telling me somebody stole your car. Well, yeah, and you know, Binky thinks it was those two guys. Well, I'll tell you something, you better go find them two guys, because if they finger you, then the cops might tie you to me, and then if you don't go get rid of them, then I got no choice. I gotta go get rid of you. Capisce? What is that? I told you not to buy that! But boss, you like antiques. This is a real art deco. Never heard of the bum! Get rid of that! Not that! That! Okay.

What if the Russians invade Pasadena? Come on, Dennis, I'm hungry. Please. Here we go. Here. Give me an N.B., hold the onions, an S.S. and a fries to go. You got it. Uh, what do you think you're doing? Oh, hi, Wardell. Putting in an order. No, you don't get it. The only people who can put in orders here are Dinkie's carhops, and you ceased being one of those at 8:15 last night. Come on, it's not my fault. I was changing my skates. See, I took my bunny rabbits off-- Yeah, and you were kidnapped by terrorists? Of course not. I was changing my bunny rabbits, and the left one got hooked. It got hooked on the bumper of one of those cars, and the guy dragged me out, all the way to Long Beach. Pick up your check Wednesday, Powell. Come on, Wardell. I came back. You guys were closing. You weren't here. I couldn't return anything. Give me a break. You know, you're a troublemaker, Powell. There'll be no more trouble. You really need this job, don't you? Yes, Wardell. Of all these people that work here at Dinkie's, you're the only one who calls me by my first name. I don't know your last name. It's Flecken. You would rather me call you Flecken than Wardell? I would rather you call me Mr. Flecken. Okay, Mr. Flecken. And, uh, occasionally "sir." Yes, sir, Mr. Flecken. Is that Swedish? No, actually, it's Swiss. It's an abbreviation. My paternal great-grandfather was a Fleckenshicker. Is that like a chicken plucker? There you go again. I'm not trying to be funny. I meant like Tinker, Taylor, Sheppard, Fleckenshicker. You know something, Powell? I'm gonna give you a break because I'm a nice guy. You are. But screw up one more time... I won't. and you can turn in those skates. You read me? Yes, I do, sir-- Uh, Mr. Flecken. Putz. Wardell nearly fired me, you know. Well, when we sell the piano, you can tell Wardell to take his job and shove it. Why would I want to do that? Because you'll be rich, and Wardell's a putz. No, he's a Fleckenshicker. That's 3.40. Will you take care of that for me, Dennis? I don't have any money. Well, neither do I. Aw, come on. Spence. Mr. Holden. Uh, Mr. Beanwhacker. Good evening. It's the first of the month, Mr. Holden. Well, good news. I'll have the rent for you tomorrow. No more checks. No, no. Cash on the barrelhead. Be still my heart. Yeah. Hey, Alice, how you doing? Whoa. What the hell was that for? You called me Alice. My name is not Alice. Oh, the hell I did. Now, wait a second. Come-- Oh, hey, come on. Alice. Boy, I don't know where that came from. Alice is somebody-- It's not important now. Sweetheart, come on. Hey, listen, I said Alice, but in my mind I was thinking that I was saying... Mary. Susan? Well, give me a hint here. How long ago was it? Last night. Oh, get out of here. I wasn't even in the neighborhood. Lorraine! Lorraine! Am I right? You live in 10 there, with a little pull-out. Oh, but come on, that was Tuesday, sweetheart. Tuesday. Whew, Jesus, that was-- Well, hell, it's Friday now. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. That was three days ago. What--? No, by God, it was Monday. Four days ago. What the hell's she expect? Fargo the Memory Wizard? Boy, what a day. And here she is shattering the world record for a mile and an eighth by an incredible 30 lengths. --Darling Tim. Sorry Sue maintains that huge lead as they come to the wire. Darling Tim making a bid for second, along with Violet's First. As they come toward the finish, it's Sorry Sue in complete control, winning by some 30 lengths. This evening, Ken Hanson talked with the county veterinarian, Dr. Henry Garfurg. You performed an autopsy on Sorry Sue. Yes. And you ascertained that she had been drugged? To the eyeballs. With what? We're not sure yet. Some kind of dynamite stimulant. She ran the last quarter at Santa Anita backwards and still won by a tail. Who do you think drugged her? That's not my department. I tried to talk to Captain Sean Swelter, who is in charge of the Sorry Sue investigation, but I was told Captain Swelter was not available to make a statement. A press conference is scheduled for 10 a.m. tomorrow. Now back to you, Karen. Thank you, Ken. We'll be sure to keep you up to date on all the latest developments in this case. Hello, um, my name is Spence Holden, and I'd like to report my car stolen. Just a few minutes ago, and I've been in all day. Uh-huh. Spencer Holden? Uh, boy, yeah. Um, can you hold one second? Do you own a yellow VW? Yes-- Yes, I do. As a matter of fact, I was just reporting it stolen here. Oh. May I? Sure. Police Lieutenant Hunker, Central Division. Did Mr. Holden just report his car stolen? Thank you, officer. Can we talk? ♪ Wise men say ♪ Only fools rush... Hi. Hi. Hi! How you doing? What a coincidence. No, no, it's no coincidence. Your landlady told me where I could find you. Oh. Right after you left the auction house, a woman asked for your address. Well, she wants to buy your piano. Oh, yeah? Yeah. I gave her your address before I even thought about it. Well, that's okay. Well, I-I thought you'd wanna know. That's great. Yeah. She was wearing a huge diamond. You could probably make a good deal. Well, if we do, anything more than we paid for it, you can have 10 percent. Oh, no, I couldn't. Uh, I just thought you'd wanna know. Well, that's okay. That's great. You-- Want something to eat? Well, I... How about a... Dinkie Burger and a shake? It's on the house. You're kidding. Who's to know? "On the house"? Well, I-I was just kidding. What about, "Who's to know?" Well, that's just a figure of speech. Excuse me-- I suggest you stay out of this. Wait, now, look, Wardell-- Now, you look, Powell-- Mr. Wardell, I think-- Fleckenshicker. It's Flecken, and I give you fair warning, Powell. You have no idea what fair is. Mr. Fleckenshicker-- That's it, you're fired! You're a putz. You're a king-sized, useless putz, Wardell. Yeah? Yeah. Well, turn your skates in. I will as soon as I come in to pick up my check. And they better be in good shape, or I'm gonna charge you for damage. Have a nice evening. He's right, putz! You're a Frecken! See, normally, we'd treat it as a recovered stolen auto, but the bullet holes are intriguing enough to prompt us to wanna hold it for a few days. I hope it won't inconvenience you too much. No, no, no. Thank you for asking. No, I'll manage, thanks. Doesn't sound like it could be driven anyway. Spoken like a healthy pragmatist. We'll keep in touch. Nice meeting you. Yeah, you too, you too. Oh, uh, by the way, what do you do? Oh, well, I'm an actor. Or I'm...trying to be. Good luck. Thanks. Thanks very much. Bye-bye. What do you think? I don't know. He just discovered the car because he's been in all day. Mr. Holden's not the type to stay in all day unless he's got a cold or company. Said he was alone. And he hasn't got a cold. Let's talk to his landlord. Well-- I... I feel real terrible about you losing your job. Oh, no. You shouldn't. I mean, I'm glad. It's time for me to move up. Someday, I wanna open up my own takeout food restaurant. Really? Yeah. What's your favorite kind of food? Your very favorite. Uh, Indian. You mean like buffalo? No, like East Indian. Like curry, right? Uh-huh. That would be original. Indian takeouts. I can call it "Ghandi's." Curry would be our specialty. Hmm. You wanna co--? You wanna come upstairs? For a minute? Sure. Just for a drink? Sure. Great. Damn it, Dennis, where the hell are you? Sorry to bother you again. That's okay. How you been? Oh, fine. Just fine. Uh, Mr. Beanwhacker says he saw you come in around 7. Oh, yeah, right. Uh, I had just discovered that my car had been stolen, and I was coming back up to, uh, report it to the cops-- The police. Well, Mr. Beanwhacker says he came here twice, once in the morning, once around 3 in the afternoon, to collect the rent, and, well, he said no one was in. Well, I didn't answer the door because I didn't have the rent. Ah. How did you know it was Mr. Beanwhacker? Oh, that's easy. Mr. Beanwhacker visits his tenants the first of every month. If he doesn't collect rent in the morning, he comes back up in the afternoon. You know, you guys should check around. I bet I'm not the only person who didn't answer his door today. One thing I gotta say for you, Mr. Holden: you sure come up with good answers, and fast. Well, it's easy when you're telling the truth. Or if you're a good actor. Oh... See you around. Yeah, well, thank you. You better be there. Shouldn't you answer it? It's probably just Spence. And that just means trouble. Could be a girl. No. Do I taste like onions? No. Do I? Mm-mm. I had gazpacho for lunch today. I had a Dinkie Burger. I think I'd like to go and brush my teeth. I don't have any extra toothbrushes. No problem. Got any paste? Right in there. Uh, it's messy. We can straighten it up in the morning. Dames... Hello. Dennis? No, there's no Dennis here. Dennis? No, there's no Dennis here. See, there's no Dennis here. Thank you. I think you have the wrong number. Bye! Dennis? Dennis? Damn it! That was you, Dennis. I know it was. Okay, fine. Fine. You don't wanna talk to me, it's okay with me. You're an accessory. It's your ass. Okay, second floor, apartment B. As in... "beautiful day." Call me later? I'll call you now. Ellen... Bye. Spence. Top of the morning to you. I wanna talk to you. Oh, great, let's go upstairs. I got some good news for you. Well, I'm glad somebody does. Where do you want this thing? Oh, that's fine. Right there. Keep it there. That's great. Isn't this neat? Sign that right there. Sure. You got yourself a D and a P. There you go. You gentlemen have yourselves a wonderful day, and may God bless you both. Go ahead. Toodles. Isn't this neat? Player piano. Where were you last night, Dennis? I got fired. Really? Yeah. What's the matter with you? Nothing. Why? You got a foolish grin on your face, and your eyes look like fried eggs. Well, I got in a little late. Didn't get much sleep. There's a woman that wants to buy the piano. What woman? Uh, got her name. It's written down right here. Pazzo. Aha. This isn't your handwriting. No. Who made the bed? What? The bed. As long as I've known you, I've never seen that bed made. This is... This is female handwriting here, Dennis. Yeah. So what? I had company, okay? She made me breakfast and did the dishes. She did? Yeah. Pazzo? No. What difference does it make? It's my business. You're right. I'm sorry. Oh, listen, when the cops come by, just tell them you spent the night with Miss... what's-her-face. What cops? Uh, Sergeant Blist and Lieutenant Hunker. They wanna know who put all the bullet holes in my car, Dennis. And what'd you tell them? Oh, surprising what a little adrenaline does to your eyes. They look positively poached. Aw, come on, Spence. Tell me. Told them I didn't know, that I was home all day. But I don't think they believed me. They're keeping the car and they're gonna check it for fingerprints. Fingerprints? Mm-hmm. So don't you think it'd be a good idea to get our stories straight? My fingerprints are all over that car. Right. Now, tell me, who was up here last night? What does she have to do with it? I don't know, Dennis. Ellen Frankenthaler. Who the hell is--? She's the one from the-- From the auction house? Yeah. Oh, shit. What "oh, shit"? She's a wonderful girl. Yeah, right. I'm sure the cops are gonna think she's twice as wonderful when they find out where she works, and that we spent yesterday afternoon with her where she works, and that where she works has an alley behind it where they found my car, with your fingerprints in it. Oh, shit. She can also tell them we told her that two guys with guns tried to kill us. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. No. Dennis, Dennis. Answer the door. Why don't you? Because it's not my door. Well, maybe it's the cops. Oh, God, maybe it's the killers. Uh, pretend you're the maid. You're the actor. I don't do voices. You do. Who is it? Yes, I'm looking for Mr. Dennis Powell. I wanna talk to him about buying his piano. Relax, relax. I'll handle this. Well. Good morning. Hello. Mr. Powell? No, but won't you come in, please? I thought I heard a woman's voice. No. No. Well, I intended to buy this piano at the auction. but this crazy racehorse got onto the freeway, and I was held up in traffic. You're kidding. No. Are you Miss Pazzo? Yeah. And I will give you 11,000 for it. Ele-- Aah! I think a thousand dollars is a reasonable profit. Yeah. What do you say, Mr. Powell? I-- Cash. Cash. Cash. Cash. Well, normally, that would be a very attractive offer, but, see, we've been looking for a piano like this for about six years now. Haven't we, Dennis? Haven't we? Twelve thousand. Twelve. Well, now... Twelve? Twelve. Uh, now, we can't forget about that client in Munich who offered us 15. Oh. I'm sorry. That's too much for me. Oh, well, now, that 15,000 included shipping. And shipping can be very expensive. Yeah, at least $2000. Still too much. Well, sometimes it's $3000. Changed my mind. Good day, gentlemen. Are you sure--? Do something. I will. I will. Oh! Uh, Miss Pazzo? We talked it over. Eight thousand. Eight? But we paid 10. All right. Wait a minute. Okay. Okay. Eight. That's including delivery. I guess that's better than nothing, huh? Where's the cash? C.O.D. What? That's the best I could do, Dennis. Well, Spence, we're flat-ass broke. How we gonna get it delivered? We'll be all right. My brother-in-law's got a truck. Oh. Stupid me. I'm only gonna need it for a couple hours. Oh, that's all right. Use it as long as you want. Hey, sis. You might have to put some gas in it, and I'll only charge you 50 cents a mile. What? I figure every mile you put on her, she's gonna depreciate at least that much. Come on, Phil, this is your brother-in-law. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. You are family. You should charge him 30 cents. Forty. Let's just tie it on top of the Caddy. No, I got a better idea, Dennis. Phil, you like my Cadillac out there? What, the one with, uh, no doors and the bashed-in grille? Yeah. Why? Well, because you're family, tell you what I'm gonna do. This is ridiculous. This is a Cadillac without doors. So what? It's a Cadillac. How much can a couple of doors cost? There you are. Thank you-- Oh! I'm-- And he traded you even? This Cadillac for that broken-down truck? Well, not even. Oh, I thought so. The truck and how much? Twenty bucks for gas. You got screwed, Phil. Why? How you figure? I don't know, but I know Spence, and you can take my word for it, you got screwed. Makeup mirror. I love the smell. Love the smell. New-car smell. Hey! Is this your car? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Shut up. Yeah! Hold on! Where did you get it? Yeah. Shut up! Yeah. Hold on! Now, back off! One at a time. And I'm gonna ask the questions. Sorry, officer. Is this your car? Yeah. Oh, yeah. I warned you! Give me that tongue. I'm gonna get that tongue, and I'm gonna pull it out, and I'm gonna fry it. I'm gonna turn it into a quirt, and sell it to a jockey I know. Hello? Miss Pazzo? Yeah. Hi. Spence Holden. Say, would it be convenient to deliver the piano to you around 9:00 tomorrow morning? Yeah, that would be fine. I'll tell Covington, the houseman, to expect you. Won't you be there? Why? Well, I was kind of hoping to see you again. Miss Pazzo? It's Claudia. Did I say something wrong... Claudia? Where are you? I'm at home. And where's your friend with the high voice? He's out. I'll be right over. Whoa, wait a second. Why? Did I say something wrong, Spence? No, no, you just don't know my address. I thought that you lived with Mr. Powell. 1133 Fountain Avenue, apartment 14. And I'm not gay, but please, don't take my word for it. Twenty minutes. Oh, God. I love it. I tried to convince Spence to go to the police, but he says if we do that, the mob will put some sort of contract out on us. By the way, if you've never had Indian food before, it can be very hot. You know, I forgot to mention to you... You know the lady you bought--? Who bought the piano from you? Miss Pazzo? Yeah. A little bread might help. Well, I know I've seen her somewhere before, in a newspaper or magazine or something. Um, and whatever it was, it was important. I think she's notorious. Good evening. Oh. Sure looks that way. May I take your coat? Sure. Oh, yeah, it's never your fault. I'm gonna kill that brother of yours. That piece of junk wasn't even his car. Yeah, well, there's something fishy about the owner and his friend. What "fishy"? He loaned him the car. Without even knowing where Spence lives? Yeah, well, you heard him. He was selling the Caddy. And he let Spence drive it for a few days. I heard him, but I don't believe him. Yeah, well, I believe him. Your brother could con a leopard out of his stripes. Spots. Were you calling Spence? You bet your sweet ass I'm calling Spence, and when I get through telling him what a no-good piece of-- Then I'm gonna talk to him. What, are you gonna tell him I gave those guys his address? Yes. You think they're gonna do something to him? Well, I'm afraid they might. They ain't gonna do nothing to him. How do you know? Because I'm gonna do it to him first, and there ain't gonna be nothing left. That's how I know.

What are you doing? Telegram for Mr. Powell. Giving him a chance to get away. Dennis! Oh! God! Dennis! Spence! My nose, man. Spence. Shit. It's all right. It's all right. My God. My nose. What are you doing hiding in here? Those two guys found me, Dennis. They were gonna shoot me. Why didn't they? I don't know. Oh, God. Well, they took one look at Claudia, and they ran. Are you Irene? Ellen. Who's Claudia? Pazzo. We were discussing the piano. Well, Ellen thinks she knows her. You do? How come? I don't know. When she came in to Ishimine's, she thought she recognized her. But I can't remember from where. She thinks she's notorious. I'm gonna ask Mr. Ishimine if he knows her. Well, whoever she is, she sure as hell saved my life. Is it swollen? Yeah. Careful, man. Oh, jeez, why did you have to hit my nose? What are we gonna do? I don't know. We can't tell him, can we? But if we don't, and he finds out-- But if we do, what about her? Just shut up and let me think. Can I think too? Yeah, but whatever you come up with you keep to yourself. What if it's a good idea? You don't believe me about your tongue, do you? No. I mean it. Stick it out. No. I dare you. Well, one thing for sure is I can't go back to my place. Well, I'm worried about Ellen. I'll be all right. She's gonna be fine as long as they don't tie her in with us. Well, maybe we shouldn't see each other. No. No, I think he's right. Just until we straighten this thing out. But how are you gonna get it straightened out if you don't go to the police? She's right. First thing's first. What's first? We sell the piano and get money. And then what? Well, then we get out of town until things cool off. But that's only gonna postpone things. I mean, sooner or later, you're gonna have to go to the police. In your heart, you know she's right. Yeah, maybe, but as things stand right now, it's gotta be later than sooner. Well, it's nearly 2:00. I better be going. I'll walk you down. No. You stay here. You guys want me to--? Yeah, maybe I should just step in here. Good night, Eileen. Ellen. Yeah, whatever. Oh, you know, I knew an Ellen-- I'm sorry. Go ahead. Yeah, she was a shepherdess on a small seashore sheep ranch. I guess you could say she sheared sea sheep by the seashore. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Good night. Good night. Dennis, can I wear the tops? I know where they are. It's okay. Recent prints on the car belonged to Holden and a man named Dennis Powell. I checked on Powell. They're old friends. Have you talked to Mr. Powell? I dropped by this morning, but he was out. We arrested Leopold Klop for making and selling this. What the hell is it? So far, Leo refuses to reveal his family recipe, but he did confess that that's what was shoved up Sorry Sue's ass that sent her into orbit. This? Well, one like it. Yeah? Leo say who did the shoving? Yeah, he identified these two gentlemen. Couple of Pazzo's henchmen. Okay, Binky, you and Turnip have one minute to come out with your hands up. There must be a hundred cops out there. How come you didn't spot them? Well, I was cooking. It's pancake day. I hate to do this to you, but you got to go out and draw their fire so I can get away and warn the boss. Come on, couldn't you just call him? Well, they probably tapped the phone. Yeah, but, Binky, please, I mean, if I draw their fire, I could get killed. Not if you run fast enough. I can't beat a bullet. I wouldn't be too sure about that. Oh, please, no, Bink, no, no, no. Drop your pants. Come on, it took 24 hours to work on Sorry Sue. You are not a horse! I-- No, Binky, please. Hey, look at this. Not too shabby. Okay, here we go. Eight thousand big ones. Come in. Excuse me. Uh, Mr. Ishimine, are you familiar with a Miss Claudia Pazzo? Careful, careful. Careful, gentlemen. Watch the carpet. Now, you take it up the stairs, and the recreation room is the first door on the left. I'd assist you, gentlemen, but your tardiness has put me behind schedule, and I have to go to the market. Uh, excuse me. Uh, sorry to bother you, but how about the money? If I am not back by the time you're finished, the kitchen is through there. Go in and wait. Knowing your brother, he probably sold my truck, stole another Cadillac and headed for Florida. He can't sell the truck without the pink slip. Yeah, oh, pink slip. Your brother needs a pink slip to sell my truck like Hitler needed Churchill's okay to invade Poland. Hey, hey. Watch out where you're driving, you crazy broad! Oh, God, Dennis, I hope her husband isn't home. Easy, easy. Watch it, watch it. Where should we put it? Let's leave it right here till I check with the lady of the house. Oh, my goodness. Whoo. Would you look at this? Oh, boy. May I get you a drink, young man? Sure. Oh, my goodness. Look at these. "To Tony. "Best wishes and a long life, from Dutch, Hymie and everyone in the Vigilio family." Here you go. That one looks familiar, doesn't he? He's in a lot of them. Look at this. "To Tony, my godfather. "You made me what I am today. Gratefully, Giovanni Fusco." They're all Italian. Yeah, well, Claudia's Italian. Maybe this Tony guy's her father or something. ♪ When the moon Hits your eye ♪ ♪ Like a big pizza pie I wonder where she is. ♪ That's amore ♪ You're gonna be gone long?

What are you doing here? What do you mean, what am I doing here? Oh, come on, I'm not that bad. Come on. So I'm not the greatest in the world. Don't you think you're overreacting? Sweetheart... Who's that? My husband. My husband. What are you doing? Forget about it. Just go under the bed. Ow! Just... leave me alone. What's the matter with the snookums? I just wanna sleep some more. We're gonna have breakfast, so come on, get up. I wanna sleep a while. You slept nine hours. That's two hours longer than a pig sleeps. I could've been some singer, eh? Uh, not for nothing, you have any idea what happened to the door handle? Um, yeah, I... Well, I just woke up in the middle of the night and just, you know... I-I don't know. Yeah? What was you trying to do, raid the icebox? Yeah, but I just couldn't get out. Yeah? Well, that serves you right. Please, I want you to go downstairs, okay? Yeah, watch my foot, though. I'll watch it. Let me open this little thing... So just go downstairs. Yeah, but before I go, we gotta-- Pazzo. Tony Pazzo. Spence, it's the mob. Oh, jeez. Oh, jeez, you found one. Claudia. Coming. Let's go. Let's go. Sweetheart! Hey, buttercup, I hate to wake youse up, but I just had to tell you how much I love it. Hey, you hear me? Hey. It's just what I wanted for my birthday. I'm so glad. How about you give me a nice big birthday kiss. Why don't you just go and have some coffee, and I'll see you in a little while. Okay? I'll just go down in a little while. Okay? Come on. You still got it for me, don't you? I'll meet you there, okay? Yeah. Okay. All right, but don't be long. No. Jesus, you got some cold starting there. You better make sure you take the orange juice. Or the Robitussin. Shake that gorgeous ass. I'll come back there, get another bite of it. Okay. Don't. Someday they're gonna do my life story. The Singing Godfather. Just get off me. Hurry up. What are you doing down on the floor? Come on. Spence. Jump. Come on, jump. Are you kidding? It's gotta be 20 feet down there. Aah! Don't do that! You know who Tony is? Do I know who he is? I just spent five minutes with him. Jump, you gotta jump. Go down without anyone seeing. How am I gonna do that? I don't know, but you can. Back the truck up under the window. Hey, honey doll! Sweetie pie! Where the hell is she? Sugarplum! Hey, we gotta get-- What? Yeah, the cops... The cops busted the professor, and they shot it out with them numskulls Binky and Turnip, and we gotta go to Mexico. We gotta lay low for a while. Okay, well, let me get my jewelry. Yeah, okay. Oh, my foot. So go get the truck. Um... Uh... Honeybun, you ready? I mean, are we gonna fly? Yeah, only to San Diego. Then we gotta take a boat. Oh, no. I don't wanna take a boat. You know, I hate to take a boat, because-- What? Where's the handle to this friggin' door? I don't know. Well, honeybun, you know I get seasick. Six-million-dollar house, and the friggin' doors don't work. Faggot designer bastard! Are you okay? Yeah? Well, you know what? I think if we fly all the way-- Covington, where the hell are you? Honeybun, if we fly all the way, it'd be so much better. Where the hell is everybody? Covington must have gone to the market. We'll probably have to drive ourselves. Get ready, sweetheart. Get ready. Yeah, I will. I'm only gonna take two suits. Morning, Covington. Buenos dias, seÃ±ora. God damn Covington is never around when you want-- Where the hell have you been? Buongiorno, godfather. "Buongiorno," my ass. Pack this. You got it. Shoes. My foot swells up any more, I ain't gonna get it into an egg crate. Hey, Covington. Where'd these come from? I have no idea, sir. All right, you take that stuff down to the car. I found these in my closet. Throw them out. They're not mine. No? How did they get in your closet? You don't know? Well, how should I know? They belong to some guy. Hey, my car! Why, you-- You! What the hell is going on here? Dennis! Hey, slow down, Dennis! Got you. I got you. You're not getting away from me. Spence! Spence! Oh, no. Wait for me! Hold your fire! Tony, give it up. You're surrounded, and the SWAT team's on the way. Hold it right there! Tony. Tony, you got one minute to come out. What are you guys doing here? They're the piano movers. You're the piano movers, eh? Well, not exactly. No? Then what are youse? Well, actually, I'm an actor. And this one's trying to be a chef. Oh, yeah? I'm a waiter. You always deliver pianos with your socks on? No, not all the time. Yeah. Just today? Well, it's hot out. Hey, Covington, go get them shoes. Yes, godfather. Thirty seconds. Would you mind trying on these shoes here? For me? Oh, Pooh Bear. Yes? Excuse me. If it isn't too much trouble, I'd like to have a word with Mr. Dennis Powell, please. Keep down. Cease fire. Dennis, you gotta get out of here. I spoke to Mr. Ishimine, and he said that Claudia Pazzo is married to Tony Pazzo. We know. Irene... If he finds out that Spence has been sleeping with-- No. Not now. This is Tony Pazzo. Ellen. She's a friend. Would you just tell me who it was, exactly, sleeping with my wife? It couldn't be Spence. He's gay. Dennis! Hold your fire. Go start the car. You stepped on my foot! Get off of it! You'll never make it, Tony. Then the broads are dead meat. This is the way it's gonna happen over here. We're gonna drive away, and you're gonna let us, or I'm gonna kill the both of them. What are you gonna do? I don't know. Think he'd really kill them? If I knew that, I'd know what to do. Step on it! Not my foot. Drive! Drive! Damn it! I'll kill her! Look. He'll kill me! Don't shoot! I swear, I'll kill her! He swears! I'm crazy! I'm crazy! He's crazy! He's crazy! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

Well, what's become known as the sad saga of Sorry Sue, the little horse who was doped and ran herself to death while breaking records at two different racetracks in the same afternoon, came to an end today when mafia boss Tony Pazzo was sentenced to 15 years in prison. But Sorry Sue's saga has a happy ending. This is Ghandi's, a fast-food Indian restaurant owned by Dennis Powell and his new bride Ellen. Dennis and Ellen have been involved in this bizarre tale almost from the beginning. Good evening. Hey, dude. I see business is very good. Oh, very, very good. Always, because... ♪ If you want a meal That's fine and dandy ♪ ♪ Go to Ghandi ♪ If you want some curry In a hurry ♪ ♪ Go to Ghandi Everybody. It's crowded, I see. It's been reported that Tony Pazzo's wife has helped finance this place. True? Well, it was a favor to Dennis for helping save her life. She's a majority stockholder. And today, the buffet is 2.50 for entire bowl. I hear that she's in Chile making a movie, which she also helped to finance. Well, she was a big star in Chile before Tony Pazzo married her. The vegetables are cut fresh daily. Yeah, but what happened to your pal Spence Holden? Spence? I don't know. I haven't seen him in a couple of weeks, but he's around somewhere. Gracias.
