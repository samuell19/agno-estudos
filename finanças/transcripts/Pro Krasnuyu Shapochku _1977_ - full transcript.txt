- Catch him! Grab him! - Stop, I say! Catch him! Your piglet is now ours. - Wolf eating you last year wasn't enough! - For your grandma, too! The piglet is ours! No, ours. - Did you buy it? - Yes. Then pay up! Please! Got hit? You deserve it! ABOUT THE LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD CONTINUING THE OLD TALE So many stars today! Time flies! It's already morning. It's already morning.

"Mom"! Look at that - "mom"! Are you going to take revenge on the lumberjacks, eh? Or not? Do you think that your mother is made of iron? Do you think that she will endure this disgrace forever? A year has passed since your own brother was killed! And your comrade! And our forest? What's happening here? Scary! Soul-crushing! People are walking around like at home! Even small children are insolent now! Wandering back and forth! - Scary! - Mother! - I'm surprised with you! - He's surprised! Your own brother a year ago was K I L L E D! And your comrade! Everyone lived in fear while he was alive! The forest was ours! Everyone kept their heads down! It was our forest! You see, Mom! Mom sees everything! Have you seen our forest? I ask you: have you seen our forest? And the little one? The little one, your nephew! He's got completely out of hands looking at you! The kid is a goner! Hasn't been sharpening his teeth for days! Who will take revenge? And you're just lying around, sitting about! - Hippo! - Mom! Don't start about that! You know that! It's metabolism. We had a family! What wolves were there! The family is falling apart, there is no one to take revenge! - Mom, one more word! - And? What? You're going to hang yourself, aren't you? He'll hang himself! Mom, you ate me! MOOM! Mom! - Skinny One! - I'm thin! Oh, forgive me, the fool! Take him on this job, will you? He'll be lost! He'll get me exposed right off the bat, you know what kind of job this is, - We need skill! - So make a wolf out of him! - Skinny One? - Thin One! Don't be angry with me! He will be lost! - He ate too much! - He doesn't want to live! Only pastries and sweets! You overfed him, and now you want - him to be fit for a job like this? - Fine! - I'll pay! - Oh, of course! Payback later, after the ball! - How much? - A split! As much as he will cost me! "Your grandma is sick a." "gain." No, it's not blind luck! This has been professionally calculated! Grandpa, can I go to the forest with Little Red Riding Hood? Her grandmother is sick! Is she? Look at that! When did I exchange whistles with her? The other day? Do you remember? The day before yesterday she was sitting on the roof! And I say we exchanged whistles the other day! Nothing like that! - She was on the roof! - And I say we exchanged whistles! - She was sitting on the roof! - She was sitting on the roof! - And I say we exchanged whistles! - Hood's grandmother sat on the roof - All day the other day! - And I say that I am- Grandma's hood sat for three whole days all the way down to the chimney! - But I say- - And you say you exchanged pipes with her! - What does a pipe have to do with it when it was a whistle? - What does a pipe have to do with it, - when it was on the roof? - How was she on the roof when we did the exchange! - How did you exchange when she was sitting? - How did she sit if I have her pipe? She was sitting on the roof! She was sitting on the roof! She was sitting on the roof! She was sitting on the roof! - She was sitting on the roof! - Quiet! And I say that I exchanged whistles with her! Well, now I can't catch up with her. If you take a while, Quite a while, while, while If you take a while on the road To stomp, ride and run, Then, perhaps, then, of course, Then maybe, then surely, Then maybe, may be, You can reach Africa! Ah, in Africa the rivers are this wide! Ah, in Africa the mountains are this high! Ah, crocodiles, hippos! Ah, monkeys, whales! Ah, and a green parrot! Ah, and a green parrot! And as soon, as soon as could be, And as soon as on the track, And as soon as on the path, I meet someone, Then to the one I meet, Even to the beast, the beast I won't forget, I will say I will say "hello"! Ah, hello, Rivers this wide! Ah, hello, The mountains that high! Ah, crocodiles, hippos! Ah, monkeys, whales! Ah, and a green parrot! Ah, and a green parrot! But, of course, but, of course, If you're so lazy, If you're so timid, stay at home, don't go! You don't need roads, Slopes and mountains, Gullies, crayfish, rivers. Keep yourself safe! Why do you need the sea This wide? Why do you need the sky This high? Ah, crocodiles, hippos? Ah, monkeys, whales? Ah, and a green parrot? Ah, and a green parrot? Grandma, can I go with the Little Red Riding Hood to the forest? Her grandmother got sick. With whom? - With the Little Red Riding Hood. - Look at that! Maybe go right with the Gray Wolf? - This girl, do you know where she will take you? - Do you know where she will take you? Do you know where she will take you? What does her mother think? She already got eaten with the gran last year! Not enough for them! What a mother! What a mother! Their grandmother was always like that! Life has not taught them anything! They're stupid! They're stupid! If they are, then why does everyone love them, but no one loves us? Think before saying such things! Fine if no one loves us, but why love them? - Big deal, how special! - We are also quite educated. - Noodles on her nose, lip smeared in borsch! - And the rest! - Look at her strolling in the forest with no fear! - Walks wherever she likes, she'll regret it! - Off to treat her grandma like there's nothing else to do! - Off singing like she's mad! - She's ugly, she's no good anywhere! - Her eyes are crooked and her nose too! - And her basket is spitting! - And the grandmother is probably healthy! - Noodles on her nose, lip smeared in borsch! - And the rest! - Let her go, godspeed to that! - The whole village hates us because of her! - She's just like her mother and grandma! - They live just to spite us! - She's probably got a gun with her! - And a nail in her pocket! She probably hid a knife in the basket! You're good to go alone like that for sure! - Noodles on her nose, lip smeared in borsch! - And the rest! Say thanks to grandmas, we're saving you from trouble! - Look at her cry! - Do you think the wolves have forgotten? Ha! For the wolf mother to let it go like that? It won't happen! - It won't happen! - It won't happen! We'll hear more news! Yes. An amazing thing! I was looking into the distance yesterday... I'll curse you. Running! Running so hard! That's it! Get him ready! The girl is going to her grandmother. Move, move! Get dressed! This is for me! Great! If you want him to become a real wolf, then let him be like everyone else - hungry! Don't fuss! If we don't come until lunch - don't wait for us! You know yourself, what a job this is! Either it's your moment, or a finale in the town zoo. Ha, lumberjack! Are you going to the people with a club? Put a sign on yourself that you're a robber. He's not coming with me! Ha, did you bandage your teeth? Pretending? - But I- - He's not coming with me! Who's forcing you to eat that girl anyway? I'm not counting on that! I'm not asking anything from you! Put her in a bag and bring her to me. I know what I'm going to do with her. - He's not coming with me! - I'll pay for him. Then you will pay like people do - separately for everything. Cuckoo! Let the Fat One carry the bag! Let him do his part! - Are they going again? - Keep quiet. I know, it's to catch the girl! - Did you wash the bag yesterday? You did! - None of your business! So that the Hood won't sneeze from the dust across the whole forest, right? This girl made you a damn orphan, and you? Did she eat him first or what? He started it! Who told you that, huh? Did your uncle tell you that? - He's asking to get flogged! - What did she do to him? Well, tell me, tell me, why was she eaten? - Why don't you say something? - And why did she tell him the truth, huh? "Where does Grandma live? Where does Grandma live?" Should've kept quiet instead of blabbing the truth out! Took a sin upon herself. So think now, how the truth ends. - Oh, great! - Look, Fat One! Come on, chop it! Bravo! A new world record in hammer throwing. - Go home! Quiet. - What about Mom? There! Cut the corner. Get down, Fat One! - That's her? - Her! Who do I see! What a meeting! I don't believe my eyes! How's things? - Where are we going? - To my grandmother. Rare luck, we're heading the same way. Where does your grandmother live? Why do you have such teeth? What kind of teeth? Worthless, that's what! Is it possible to eat so many sweets? - For a lumberjack too! - And pastries as well! What are you doing! He's in pain! What if I pinched you like that? Ah! It hurts! Open your mouth! Do all your teeth hurt, or just one? - Shut your mouth! - Again?! Why do you have such eyes? - What kind of eyes? - Evil, that's what! If your mood is sour because of something, then don't spoil it for others! Because your friend... What are you doing! How strange you are! To get entangled in the bag! We're here, you could've asked for help! - You're so tangled! - I am. One couldn't do that if they tried! - Was it on purpose? - No! It wasn't! Again, I knew it! How is he not ashamed? - Where are you going? - To the Stargazer, of course! Wait, what Stargazer? You were going to Grandma! What about Grandma? Where's Mom's bag? - Where's Mom's bag? - What? A bag? Hello! So, how are things going? How many have you counted? Another million 100 thousand 280 pieces? So few? So you got distracted again? You didn't convince me, people don't snore like that! How awful! You cannot pretend at all! It's lucky you're not an actor! Come on, open your eyes, please! Open up! Aren't you ashamed to look at my schedule? SCHEDULE Day - sleep Night - starcounting - I am! - Why? Tell me why? There's a mistake! - What kind of mistake is there? - Grammatical. People don't say "starcounting". Really? I'm talking about something else! You didn't sleep this afternoon, and you're hiding behind grammar! - I was sleeping! - No, you weren't! I was trying to sleep! In slippers? Well, who's right? Have you been doing the wrong trade again? Oh-oh! What a wonderful sound! This is what you wanted to impress my grandmother with? This is an experimental version! Please don't confuse me with such words! You know perfectly well that we haven't studied this yet! And everyone knows that you made a bet with my grandma! So what? Excellent! I still say that making whistles is easier than counting stars. - So it's hard for you to count the stars? - For me? To count stars? - To say such a thing is simply incomprehensible! - Incomprehensible? - Yes! - Do you know what you've done? - What? Now my grandmother spends all night counting stars. - Counting stars? How? Does she really know how to? - Yes! The same way you know how to make whistles! - All right, you're not good for the job! - Why? Don't be afraid, I won't tell mom. I say, since you're not good for the job, - then give me at least a thought! - Aha, please! - Well, tell me! - What thought? - Why are we waiting for her? To put her in a bag. Mom's bag. I say: what will the Hood think? Will she think we're waiting for her? - She will! - She'll think it's suspicious? - She will! - She'll call for help. - She will. - Will help come? - It will. - So you will be caught, Fat One! - I'll be cau- oh! - Oh! We are lost! - We would be lost! - Quiet! Wait here! - What about me? Ah. Damn, no decent clothes! What a Stargazer, devil take him! One silly lumberjack - Do you know such one? Wanted a sheepskin coat Made without a tailor. He put down his axe Far away on the shelf And he still cannot Put thread through the needle! He put down his axe Far away on the shelf And he still cannot And he still cannot Put thread through the needle! One silly Сaptain In stormy weather Sat on a drum Instead of his ship. Hail had started at that time Bigger than a pea The drum feels good - The Captain feels bad! Hail had started at that time Bigger than a pea The drum feels good The drum feels good The Captain feels bad! Carpenters sewed trousers - So much for trousers! Elephants sang a song - That's the sounds for you! Pour water through a sieve - Here's what you get! Better to do something That you have mastered Pour water through a sieve - Here's what you get! Better to do something Better to do something That you have mastered. - Oh! - What? - Grandma! I have to run! Tell Grandma to take aspirin! One pill an hour after eating. Bravo, bravo. Professor, even children understand that you are the best butterfly catcher in the world. Calm down! Stop fooling around! "Ah, your teeth! Ah, you eat a lot of sweets!" You got tangled on purpose. Ah? I... Right. Beware, Fat One, if you fail now! - I'll run away from you. - Run, what a runner! You'll regret it! - "You'll regret it!" - Where would you go, huh? To distant countries? They've been waiting for you there, with traps and weapons. - You're mean. In other forests, wolves are useful. - Where? How do you know about other forests, huh? Oh, you know that from the book, right? From this damned book you got that, that damned book! What kind of fool threw it into the landfill! No shame! They teach them, and then take books to the landfill, eh? - "To the landfill". - What people! Here they are, the people! Well, show me where you hid it. - This damned book? - Come on, come on - look for it! What are you doing? Talking to your own grandmother like that? - With your own grandmother! - Go search for it, why aren't you searching? I'll find this damned book! I'll tear it to shreds! If there's wind - I'll spread it in the wind! Tell the truth - where did you bury this book? Or this spoon will dance on your head! - Well, tell the truth! - I won't tell the truth! So you'd eat me for it? You said that yourself about the girl. - No, Professor, in our village- - In their village, they do not catch them like that, Professor! Are you crazy? - Why, Professor? - Because that's how you catch only a calf, Professor! Come in from the left, you idiot. Butterflies are caught like this! That's it! Come on! A-a-a mama! Not my turn! - Professor, we missed the butterfly. - Oh, Mom! - Follow me, Professor! - Get off me! That's it! The end! My leg! Peek-a-boo, Professor, I'm here! Give it back! Do you hear, let go of the bag, it's not a toy for you! That's not fair! Now it's my turn! - My turn! - Come on, I'm not a boy! But you were a child once, right? You were! You were! Were you a child? His leg must be hurting. - We should put herbs on it! - What herbs! If Grandma finds out that I left you with a bad leg, she'll get even more sick. Please don't dust the bag! Give it here! Why do you need to catch someone? - That's the way it works: someone has to catch someone! - I disagree! I disagree as well! For example, we catch - an elephant! What are we going to do with it? - An elephant? Let's eat it! - So that it gets stuck in your throat? - Ha! An elephant! - An elephant? First of all, you can't eat them! - How? Why? You gave a bad example! Bring him a chicken. Who ever tried to eat an elephant? Just look at that! They won't eat one! Has anyone tried to eat an elephant? Ugh, Professor! Look at you - you're like a predator! Don't pay attention to him - the professor is hungry! On the road. We were delayed on the way, and he is ready to eat an elephant. An elephant! Catch him, he'll drown! Catch him! Don't touch him, he bites! So what! Hold him! Well, Fat One? Did you eat an elephant? Even so? Get out of here! Bravo, bravo! - Catch! - Ah! Oh, good girl! Here they are! People! - Buy her for me! - We will! What are you doing? I have to go to my grandmother! - My grandmother is ill! - Your grandmother will wait! That's not fair! My grandmother is sick! Where are you taking me? Let me go now! A person is not for sale! Look, Fat One! Take a good look! These are people! I will have my revenge! I will take revenge on her! Oh, you, my darling! - Jump, it's your turn! - I don't have time to play, I'm in a hurry! Even so?! You'll be whipped. And then you will jump real good! No way! I have a thing to take care of, and I'll do it first. I don't care what you need to take care of! I don't take care of anything! Everyone has to take care of something. - But I'm a child! - Don't talk nonsense! You're a person. And you must live like one. - Jump! - No way. No one jumps in the house and stains the floors with chalk. Try washing it off later, just try! - What are the babysitters for? - Ha, nannies! What if you appear on an island in the ocean tomorrow? An island? That's great! But how will you live there without a cook, without a nanny? - I'll find someone! - Yes, it would be nice if so, But we know, That is this island, that is this island, That this island is uninhabited! - Uninhabited? - That is, completely! There are no pillows, there are no mattresses, There is not a single crib! - I'll sleep on the grass! - You'll catch a cold on the grass! Fire, fire, fire! - I'll order to build a fire! - But we know, That is this island, that is this island, That this island is uninhabited! - What, completely uninhabited, right? - That is, completely! No one will come to help No one will get firewood, No one will cook anything On any fire! - And I'll go and find an axe! - And what will happen next? You'll swing at a pine tree, But hit your own leg! - Do you know how to collect mushrooms and nuts? - No. - Can you escape from a crocodile? - I can't. - Don't be afraid, we will save you! - How are we going to save him, After all, we believe, That this island is uninhabited! - But I... But I... - And you're sitting on the shore, You're warm and bored. You're sitting there, losing weight By leaps and bounds. But why? Why? That's because, that's because You have never done anything in your life by yourself! - Well, I'm off. - Stop! Well, did you buy her for me or not, I still don't understand! SLEEP TIME It's time for the baby to sleep! Let me go! I want to play! - Oh, how lovely! - Let me go now! Take her! Lock it up! Drink, drink. Ah, devil. They're still out there. Taking ages! And this one is still sleeping. Escaped! Escaped! Oh, damn it! Little Red Riding Hood! Little Red Riding Hood, don't be afraid of us! We are your grandmother's friends! Hee-hee-hee! Grandma's friends! Come down quickly! Well, that's it. Hee-hee-hee. Come down quickly! Here, come here to us! Well, that's it. - Little Red Riding Hood! - Don't be afraid of us! Don't be afraid of us! Everyone is asleep now! I'll scream! Scream. I'm so tired of you. I don't care anymore! Scream. - I won't scream. - Then don't. You were caught and locked up. But I still won't be able to become your friend by force. Even if they keep me here until my old age. You'll... You'll get whipped now! And then you will love me alright! You've gone crazy with these whips! Do you like those who whip you? What! Nobody can whip me! And why so? Because I'm a child! Do you want a secret? - I do! - Come here. You know, I'd give you a good whipping. - Why? - Because you are... ...an unpleasant child. Oh, baby! So much trouble with you. Well, don't cry. Come on! Let's make a good deal! Well, come on, come on, come on! Let the dog out! Hurry up! What about me? Thieves, thieves! What's going on here? Let the dog out quickly! Where are you going? Little Red Riding Hood! - Wait, Red One! - Wait! Help! I have to tell you something. Speeches later, after the ball. Put on your shoes and follow me! I'll catch up with her now. She won't get away! Wait! Oh, Mom! Oh, what am I going to tell him? No, this is not for me! Where are we running, why are we running, for what are we running? The bag! What am I going to tell him? - Why are you limping? - My shoe is tight. - You can stretch it out. - No need to stretch anything. - Hold the umbrella! - Sure. - Where's the bag? - Gone. - Well! You are such a sad lady! Something must have happened to you. - Aha. - I have one thing for you! I can make you happy. Look at your complexion. After a walk, you won't recognize yourself! - Oh! There's someone sitting there! - Now you're merry! Who's sitting there? Take a look! Well, who's there? It's you, madam! I'm not like that! Of course you're not like that! Your teeth hurt. Everyone is not like that when their teeth hurt! So you didn't recognize yourself. Well, look, good people, Well, is it really me? Oop, madam! La-la. No, you are still a very sad lady! Something has happened to you after all! The sad lady lost one very important thing. Well, don't lose heart! If this thing got lost in our forest, then it will definitely be found. We just need to look carefully. Yes, I was robbed! But that's not true! They don't rob in our forest anymore. It was a long time ago, last year. Before my grandmother and I were eaten by a wolf. - But I was robbed! - Fine, don't be nervous! I'll tell the lumberjacks and they'll look for it. Who? To whom? Lumberjacks! You heard right - it's them, yes! Oh, lumberjacks are real men! Once they start, they'll do a proper search! And they will definitely find it. Oh, our girl will get caught in the rain. Rain! Rain, hurrah, rain! Oh we don't need that! You'll catch a cold and get us in more trouble! Let's go! Look what she's doing! No shame, too! Her grandmother is ill and look at her! What a rain! That's some rain! Ah! Mom! Let the winds rage. Let the storms storm. The roads beckon me. The paths beckon me. I don't know what I'll meet, But I carry with me One cartridge with buckshot, Another cartridge with a dream. Pa-pa-ba-pa, the weather rages! Pa-pa-ba-pa, a thunderstorm is storming. Pa-pa-ba-pa, a thunderstorm is storming! Bringing trouble, as they say. But a brave heart is not afraid of any enemy. But a brave heart is not afraid of any enemy! Pam-pa-ba-pam, pa-pam-pam-pam-pam! And won't leave a friend in trouble. I have been threatened more than once In the woods, around the corner. Bandits and daggers, Hooves and horns. But I walked towards it, Holding in front of me One cartridge with buckshot And another with courage. Pa-pa-ba-pa, the weather rages! Pa-pa-ba-pa, a thunderstorm is storming. Pa-pa-ba-pa, a thunderstorm is storming! Bringing trouble, as they say. But a brave heart is not afraid of any enemy! But a brave heart is not afraid of any enemy! Pam-ba-pa-pam, pa-pam-pam-pam-pam! And won't leave a friend in trouble. I do not demand a reward, I don't want any honor, Tell me if you need to - I'll come and protect you. I don't need any gunpowder, No bullet, no wad, While my cartridges hold The fire of my soul! Pa-pa-ba-pa, the weather rages! Pa-pa-ba-pa, a thunderstorm is storming. Pa-pa-ba-pa, a thunderstorm is storming! Bringing trouble, as they say. But a brave heart is not afraid of any enemy! But a brave heart is not afraid of any enemy! Pam-pa-ba-pam, pa-pam-pam-pam-pam! And won't leave a friend in trouble. - Bravo! - Bravo! Ah! How frivolous I am! There are ladies there! Can you imagine - they only have sun umbrellas with them. I looked around and they were gone. What if they were washed away by the rain? It's an honor to come to the ladies' aid! For any hunter! Ah, damn! I'm sick of you! You're doing everything on purpose! Got that? - How could you think that? - I have nothing to think about! - Understood? Where's the bag? - Gone! I was robbed! Poor mother! To get so lost in the lies. - Who robbed you? - I'm afraid to tell you. - You won't believe it again! - Stop making faces! Who! - The wolf cub! - What wolf cub? Our, wolf cub! You see! I told the truth! I pity the poor cub, I really do, but nothing can be done! Stop! Stop, for your own good! The bag! Hurry! Damn that pup! Yes, there's nothing to think about. The case is more than strange. We let the Hood go, but there's something wrong in the forest! All right, let's go! Goodbye, my dog! Business Affairs! - I see you! - sEeE! - Get out quickly, I'm in a hurry. - hUrRy. - I know you're a boy. - A bOy! They always mock and disrespect girls. Oh dear. Doctor! Come to your senses! You'll get wet! You will become furry and green! - I won't! - Ah, here you are! Hey, there, at the bottom - hold on tight! - Whistle everyone up! - Don't you dare drag me! Let go, I say! Don't even count on it. I can't leave you in the lurch. Moreover, it is an abandoned well. - Get away from the well! I like it here. - Lies! No one sits in a well if life is good. - They will if they need to! - Lying won't do you any good! None of your business! You told the truth once. And not just once, I tell the truth all the time, so what? So you and your grandmother were eaten by a wolf! He couldn't! He tried to, but couldn't. He did, I know! Well, if he had eaten me, I wouldn't have been there? Then who would have pulled you out of the well? Admit it, who? And you... and you would be stuck here forever. Well, why are you silent? Mommy! Everything will be billed! Oh, what devil carried you into the nettles? Why? Why suffer so much?! Hey, you sufferer, why did you get carried into the nettles? - I wanted to cut a corner! - Were you covering our trail? Was I?! You saw yourself how I almost perished there! - He was covering the trail! - I wasn't. - He was covering the trail! - I wasn't covering the trail! I'll show you! - You really offended me. - Oh, a shark with a daisy in its teeth! Traveling circus! Only one performance and only for you! And for free! You're very lucky! Do you recognize us? This is the most famous clown in the world! And for free! Work, he recognized us! Well? Were you laughing? Are you satisfied? For this, you won't tell anyone that you saw us. Is it a deal? - Why? - Because we can't work for everyone for free. The artist is tired, the audience will not forgive him for this. And why can't I tell anyone? - They're waiting for you! - Them? Forget it! But why can't you tell anyone, huh? Why? Well, he won me over! Free of charge doesn't suit you, but you want a ransom for silence? More? Come on! Show me your eye! You see, it's all because of this Riding Hood! Some damsel, and yet! - I'll punch her back! - You will? I don't think it'll happen. Bad situation friend! You don't have the strength! - What? - Have you seen the lumberjacks? Do you know why? Here! That's where men get their strength from! - So be it, I give you my most treasured thing! And what is more treasured than money? - A deal. Good! Here, go! Have a good smoke! You'll remember me more than once. Well, now I'll give you it all, damn it! Just take a deep drag! - Do you smoke? - Wow! You've overheated, Fat One! It's only in fairy tales that wolves smoke wildly, but in real life a smoking wolf is doomed to extinction. He will reek of so much smoke, that every chicken will smell him a mile away. The pipe is for fools. This scoundrel decided to blackmail me. Took a lot on himself! That's alright, after the first puff he will quit the game! What, what, what is this? Who, who, who is this? Washing, washing with his own hand, Rubbing, rubbing with his own foot. This is terrible! This is terrible! This is terrible! He must be sick! This is terrible! This is terrible! This is terrible! He must be sick! Ah, ah, how blind we were! That's what it's come to! Living like this is stupid and ridiculous. All by himself, but what are people for? This is terrible! This is pointless! This is dangerous and not good! This is terrible! This is pointless! This is dangerous and not good! Eats by himself, says it tastes better! Drinks by himself, that's one for you! He'll get used to eating without servants, And then he will demand the same from us. Where's that girl? Where's that girl? Where's that girl? Flog her right away! Where's that girl? Where's that girl? Where's that girl? Flog her right away! He'll learn to tie his own shoelaces, Plant flowers, wash dishes. Then he will grow up, He won't be able to order, shout, punish, He will make friends with someone And become a stranger to us! Where is the girl? Where is the girl? Where is the girl? Capture her alive! Where is the girl? Where is the girl? Where is the girl? Capture her alive! Since you're sitting there anyway, please do one good deed! What kind of good deed? Like this! Please look at the sky from there. Is it true that the stars are visible from the well during the day? - So? Are they? - They are. And you kept asking why, for what, how! Didn't you go to school? - I had a book. - Where is it now? It got burned. Well, don't worry. I will introduce you to a great stargazer! When you're lonely And sad for any reason, Or there is something you want to understand, Go and find a gray-haired stargazer, He's right there, closer than you think! To all the questions in the world Does he have the answers - He has read three thousand books, And learned the whole sky, Measured all the planets He will allow you to take a look at them. There, at a high altitude, It's even scary to say where, The stars are hanging like oranges, But between the stars, between the stars, With their tails up, their lush tails, Comets walk - pompous, like peacocks, And on the Moon, on the Moon, A bear rides on an elephant. Moon Bear - blue eyes, Without noticing that We are looking at him, He reads fairy tales aloud to himself. He reads fairy tales aloud to himself. Then all the sadness passes, When you look at the sky - Through a telescope or just out the window, But, really, at this time No rain, no snow Should be on the streets Then among the countless Treasures of the firmament There will be a star for you too But there has to be good weather On planet Earth. High, high up there Someone had spilled milk, And created the Milky Way And along it, along it, Between the pearl fields, The Moon swims like a white canoe. And on the Moon, on the Moon, On the blue boulder, The Moon people are watching, They don't take their eyes off How above the Moon, above the Moon Every night, the globe of the Earth Beautifully sets and rises. Beautifully sets and rises. That's enough! Close your eyes and count to ten! - Please! - And don't try to peek! What nonsense! Run wherever you want! - Hey, you! You can open your eyes! - Thank you! It's not even certain whether your grandmother is ill or not! "Uncertain" how? I don't understand! There is nothing to understand here - it's uncertain, and that's it! Did someone run through here? - Who? - Little Red Riding Hood. Guys. We'll agree on the bridge. Who do you guys work for? - For the owner. - And we - for Mom! Did you guys hear that? For Mom! Mom! For the sake of your mothers... Guys, huh? He promised Mom. Well! Trust me, don't get involved in this, guys! You can't get me here! I'm a catcher, I've been catching all my adult life: chickens, hares, good luck, the devil! But catching children is pointless. Look at him. Were you catching children? - I was, you know yourself. - And did you actually catch anyone? - No, you know that. - I know, I know. But why? How much is two times two equals four, guys? Don't you know? Your situation's bad, guys! But they know. The children. They know everything! Three times three! Four times four, five times five, Bunnies out for a jive! Then the hunter runs out - Shoots a bunny in the snout! Pew-pew, what a score! Little bunny is no more! Well, buns? Come on! The girl is ours! Master! - Where to now? - Water suits fine! Hooray, victory! Don't yell. You wouldn't understand that, Fat One! I needed a real victory, a moral one! I'm starting to lose my shape chasing this girl. It's no good for you to walk around with no trousers and a hat on, Fat One. - It's time to dress up! - Oh what is it! Oh, another rare luck! Hey, my children, come to your senses! - It's not good to be naughty like that! - Come to your senses! Come to your senses! Oh! The child is close! Why such a fuss? I just wanted to ask her. Ask what? What exactly? A porridge recipe? A tune for a nursery rhyme? The pattern of the little red riding hood? - You've switched to her side! - I didn't. You've switched to her side! Don't! - Ah! - Ah! Finally! Where have you been? I thought you were lost. What? - I wanted to... - Father, you mistook the girl. - This girl is different! - Why? Don't be frightened, my child! He's very absent-minded, don't pay attention to him. He forgot his glasses on the shore and all. - Oh, yes! - Oh, don't forget your glasses on the shore. That's why you didn't notice this hole. It's lucky that you fell so well! - Well, give me a hand! - Don't, I'll do it myself! Please! Holy Father, give your hand to your savior. Come on! No one with a good life would be chained up. I'm having such a funny day today! I've only been meeting fat and thin people. The fat ones have toothache and they constantly fall somewhere. Don't die laughing. Well, you've done a good deed! - Please, mademoiselle! - Oh, thank you. If you take a while, Quite a while, while, while If you take a while on the road To stomp, ride and run, Then, perhaps, then, of course, Then maybe, then surely, Then maybe, may be, You can reach Africa! Ah, in Africa the rivers are this wide! Ah, in Africa the mountains are this high! Ah, crocodiles, hippos! Ah, monkeys, whales! Ah, and a green parrot! Ah, and a green parrot! And as soon, as soon as could be, And as soon as on the track, And as soon as on the path I meet someone, Then to the one I meet, Even to the beast, the beast I won't forget, I will say I will say "hello"! Ah, hello, Rivers this wide! Ah, hello, The mountains that high! Ah, crocodiles, hippos! Ah, monkeys, whales! Ah, and a green parrot! Ah, and a green parrot! But, of course, but, of course, If you're so lazy, If you're so timid, Stay at home, don't go! You don't need roads, Slopes and mountains, Gullies, rivers, crayfish. Keep yourself safe! Why do you need the sea This wide? Why do you need the sky This high? Ah, crocodiles, hippos? Ah, monkeys, whales? Ah, and a green parrot? Ah, and a green parrot? Only thieves steal, only greedy people are greedy. - And only liars lie! - Well, not always, my child, It's not simple. You are small and don't know life. But my Grandma? When my grandmother was little, in their village there was a lying shepherd boy. He lied all the time that the herd was attacked by wolves. And everyone ran to help him. And when the herd really got attacked by wolves, no one came to help him. And the wolves attacked the herd and ate it! Grr! - Old fairy tales! How many were there? - Who? - The ones that attacked the herd? - I don't know. I thought so! You don't know, and yet you present it as real! - My child... - Fine, I'll ask my grandmother. Ask first indeed, enough of slandering wolves. I didn't mean wolves, I meant the shepherd. Eat the herd! From a scientific point of view, this grandmother's village had to have all the wolves run to it, swim, fly through the air, every wolf on earth! A worldwide invasion of wolves on one village! - Isn't there too much fuss? - Why can't you eat the herd? And who tried to eat the herd? Wait! Don't move! Come on, repeat your last words! I've seen you somewhere! Who tried to eat the herd! Ha, ha, ha! You remind me of a professor I know, - only he wanted to eat an elephant. - No wonder, the Holy Father had nothing to eat since this morning. Oh, how stupid I am! I have so much food here! Ah! What's it? Ah! Our forest is burning! Hurry up and run for help! Run for help, run, your mother's only hope. - This time you forgot about the bag yourself. - I forgot about the bag?! It was you who distracted me! What were you saying? You, you made an idiot out of me, a seasoned wolf! "All fat people have toothache! What a complexion you have!" Skipping rope for the Fat One! As if everyone else has gone extinct! Now we will wait for the second coming. Until their forest burns to the damn ground! - Oh, he ran away! - Gone! So much smoke from one shepherd? Where did you get this stuff, huh? I'm asking you! - What? - Didn't you recognize me? Stop doing this right now! Calm down! I'm going to punch you in the eye! - Let me just get some strength. - Ah, sure, sure. I'll punch you in the eye. Come on, then! Do it! Do it and calm down! It's over for you! I will be avenged! Don't talk nonsense! I feel sorry for your sister. Better feel sorry for yourself! - The wolves will eat you! They will avenge me! - Oh! - When will it be! - When? This very minu- Here's what smoking does! I don't believe you, they're not wolves! - They're wolves! - Wolves?! What if they attack the herd? Grandma is not stupid, our cow is sitting at home. Your cow is sitting at home? How awful! You're pushing me on a ruse. Well, what is it with this forest? Is it burning or not? No idea! It looks like we're starting to walk in circles. Recognise her, Fat One? Finally the child got tired. How idyllic! Don't try doing anything idiotic, like you do, to wake her up. Children are good when they sleep. Follow me! Ah, the unfortunate ones! Take it for yourself! It's bad. There was hope - we could have made a deal with the other one. Then I miscalculated, he probably smoked too much. Didn't you smoke the pipe? - These don't want to. - These? Who are they, what will they do? Well, the time has come to avenge you. You're our man, I understand that. Drive away the herd. - Why? - We need this girl. - Do you understand? Drive away the herd! - Come on! Don't be afraid, we will avenge you. Drive away the herd! One second - and we'll put her in a bag. Oh, I understand why you're silent! It's not enough for you. Do you need a bigger ransom? Okay, I'll pay you after the ball. Don't you believe it? I give a wolf's word! If you are a real, decent wolf, Even if your entire skin is in patches, And bloody revenge Still shines in your eyes And you still have natural anger, Then you must eat your Sworn enemies with honor! Eat, eat, eat! Sharpen, sharpen the teeth, sharpen the fangs! Look - there is a prey, Grab and drag it away! Some eat hay, some eat grass And our wolf business is To drag and grab! Drag and grab! Why didn't your friend sing? How?! Didn't he sing? Didn't you sing, Fat One? The child is interested. I'll tell you a secret, he fell in love with this Little Red Riding Hood. Oh! Well, do you agree to the deal? Now I agree to everything. What's wrong with you? I don't recognize you! I just got in a very bad mood. Mood? A great thing! You'll be in a great mood soon! Come on, fetch some water, My throat is dry. Quick! What are you doing? You can't drink poppy dewdrops! They make you very sleepy. - Give it back, it's not yours! - Don't shout! It's not someone else's! Do you recognize me now? You see, our forest was attacked by wolves. Well, that's fine, we have a whip. - Hush, silly! - Are you scared? No. I'm disgusted. Why do you need to collect poppy dewdrops? They make you sleepy! What if the wolves really fall asleep? Then we'll buy time. Walk through the poppy field, then along the stone path, then on a knitted one - and you will come to my grandmother. Alright? - It's not scary, is it? - No, no. Ah, the messenger! Well, how is our friend, sleeping? Since the friend is sleeping, the matter can wait. It's time to eat a little, we are exhausted! Wow, what a charm! Here, Fat One, drink! You have to carry a bag, a full one. You did a great job today. I thought you were going to die skipping rope with your friend. So what? Think before wearing someone else's clothes next time! She didn't do anything to me personally, that girl. But I don't care about any of your tender thoughts! Your mother pays me, I serve. What? Mom pays you? - But I thought you- - What did you think? What did you think, holy simplicity? Did you think I was dying here with you - out of selfless love for your brother? - But he - He was such a friend to you! - A friend! His teeth were just bigger and sharper than mine. I, an orphan, worked for him like a beast! He was only ordering around! A chicken once almost pecked out my eye! And at night I only dream of dogs. Did anyone care about that? But the way you sang! What did I sing? What?! Maybe I was singing along out of loneliness? - But Mom thought- - Mom didn't think anything! She paid and I worked. - Why did you work for us involuntarily? - What's the use of serving yourself alone? Sometimes I want to do something for others. I want to - and that's it! You've never worked, Fat One. You wouldn't understand that. - Your place is in the zoo! - Don't joke like that! - I'm not joking. A zoo is a zoo, just sleep day and night. Eternal sleep! And at the same time, they bring food for nothing. Just because these kids are admiring your person and eating popsicles. It's funny! Funny?! When I was a child, I also laughed day and night, pitied the chicks and wanted tenderness. And now, because of this family, where everything is built on self-interest, I hate all living things. I especially hate children. Any one of them can turn into a logger or a hunter. But don't be afraid of me. Most of all now I hate this girl. Her red hat. She tired me out. I would have forgiven her for that, but she got into my soul. I remember the bright river. I remember the untouched forest. A lamb could walk by - Nobody would eat it. Grass, pretty flowers, Mom baking pies: Eat, my boy, While your little teeth, While your little teeth, Teeth, teeth, teeth, teeth Are still not yet fangs I didn't know and didn't remember, How a tooth differs from a fang. I sure realised it later, And then I got used to it. But when I wake up in the night I hear even now: My dear boy, While you're still a wolf cub, While you're still a wolf cub, A cub, a cub, a cub You are not yet a monster Grass, pretty flowers, Mom baking pies: Eat up, my boy, While your little teeth, While your teeth, Teeth, teeth, teeth Teeth... - Hello! - Do you need a whistle! No! - Our Little Red Riding Hood was attacked by wolves! - What?! Pa-pa-ba-pa, a thunderstorm is storming. Bringing trouble, as they say. But a brave heart is not afraid of any enemy. But a brave heart is not afraid of any enemy! - Pam-pa-ba-pam, pa-pam-pam-pam-pam! - And won't leave a friend in trouble. - What are you saying? - How lucky that we've met! Are you glad? You know, I'm always terribly lucky with meetings! Do you believe in happy meetings? - Great happiness. I'll sit down. - Let's go quickly! - People are in danger! - What danger? - Let's run! - Where to? - Not there, but here! - Where? - I'll tell you on the way. Oh, Mother! - Wait, where are you going! - Quiet, you! - You're a hunter! - Why are you yelling? What have I done to you? A hunter! Hunting is when you're in for the game. But when you don't want to play, who needs it? I suggest: Let's get out of here, before it's too late. For your sake. For my sake? Let the others be eaten? Fine, I'll sneak up. I'll shoot them at point-blank range! Go and see, see if they are sleeping soundly? Do you want to shoot them while they're sleeping? Are you suggesting we wake them up? Enough! Can't go there, can't go here, you can't run, you can't shoot - Wait! - I have children! - You don't have any children! - How come? If you had children, you wouldn't be a coward! - Give it back now! - I won't! - I won't give it back! - Quiet! Give me the gun, it's loaded! - You can hit me in the eye! - So what? - Give it back, good girl, give it back! - I won't give it back! - Return it now! Give it back! - Let go! What do you want from me? What do you need? We need to bring them under escort to the village, people should judge them! Ha, I understand you! You want to become famous all over the village! How stupid! Is it really not clear that they can repent at the trial? Wolves? Repent? - Give me the gun now! - I won't give it back! - Stupid girl, give it back now! - I won't give it back! Leave the child alone, Dad! Gentlemen, this is a mistake! I'm not a lumberjack, I'm a hunter. Your relative was killed by loggers, and I am a hunter. Hunting is a sport! It's completely harmless: bang-bang, oh-oh-oh! And she said that you will repent at the trial. - I don't agree. - Then take the gun. It- - It will be useful to you! - You want to frame us real good! Wolves with a gun? Keep it for yourself! When I fall asleep - bang-bang, oh-oh-oh What are you saying! Who do you take me for? Never! No way! Little Red Riding Hood! Little Red Riding Hood! The masks have been dropped! The play is over! Along the way, you were always interested in this item. Mademoiselle, please - here it is, in front of you. Step in it. And we'll tie it on your head with a big bow. Gentlemen, we're wasting time. No, I don't agree! A matter of honor! Mademoiselle, your last word. I don't want to talk to anyone. You deceived me. We walked so nicely through the forest! Why didn't you put me in this bag the first time? Did you give me this opportunity? You've been talking all the way! While spinning like a spindle - Not a single pause. Interrupting midword, or attacking from behind is his brother's business. But not mine! You saw that I work professionally! - Gentlemen wolves, it's time! - Remove him. Leave us, you're a stranger. We'll figure things out in our forest. As you say. - Come here, don't be afraid! - I'm not afraid! Put me on my feet! - Where are you from, dear? - What happened? - Dear me! Our Little Red Riding Hood was attacked by wolves! Why the hell didn't you stay at home? Why did you go to the forest alone? You've already had a bitter experience. - But my grandmother got sick! - Where did you get this from? She's not sick. - But it was written on the fence. - On the fence? Do smart children read what is written on fences? And good children - would they spoil the fences? Ah, I got you! So you're not good? Not good! You wrote it. - Shame on you! - Bad! Good! You confused me! - Now you're bothering me! - I'm not. I was walking. You attacked me yourself. Little Red Riding Hood! - Gentlemen, we have to go! - Remove him! Get out! Please understand, you're a stranger! Bringing trouble, as they say. - Sit down. - Little Red Riding Hood! - I work honestly! - Do you? - Catching other people's chickens and other people's children? - Don't confuse the two! I do dishonest things, but I do them honestly! And don't look at me with your blue eyes! You yourself, when things got hot, - resorted to deception! - It's not true! I kept my fingers crossed all the time. - Like this! - It doesn't do anything! - It does! - Absolutely nothing! - It does, when you hold your fingers like that, - Lies are flying away from you! - Don't start! I won't get bored with you. Look what you did to the Fat One! - And I have to answer for him to his mother. - Don't call him that, he's cute! He's Fat! You were always rude to him, even when you were ladies! - He's Fat! - He's cute! He gives hope! Cute! Give me your basket. Quickly! Now all children who love their grandmothers so much, will cry heavy tears! Is it true? Well, saw for yourself? "Cute"? He was hungry. He's selfish! This is Mom's handiwork! Gentlemen, we have to go! - We have to go, I have- - You don't have any children! So, child, you have left us no way out. If you are released, you will gather people. - Of course! - And publicly announce to them about our whereabouts. - Of course, since you are like that. - Oh, that's an idea. Here's the bag, child. And here is your last ray of sunshine. Say goodbye to it. It will be a bit dark in the bag. Please. People! Everyone over here! Heyyy, the girl is saved! We have to run! Stop fussing! The last minute must be lived beautifully. What's wrong with you? Pull yourself together! You sure liked living, Fat One! And why? What for? You'll be behind bars in the town zoo, and they- Fine, we'll do time. Little Red Riding Hood!! Oh, good people! Ow, people! I'm here! - Well done, boy! - I'm not a boy, I'm a girl! Really? No rain, no snow, no cold wind In the cloudless midnight hour. The sky opens up The sparkling core For the keen and joyful eyes. The treasures of the universe shimmer as if they are breathing, The zenith is ringing slowly. There are such people, They can hear perfectly, When a star is talking to a star: - Hello! - Hello! - Are you shining? - I'm shining! - What time is it? About twelve. There on Earth, at this hour It's the best time to see us. What about the children? The children? They must be sleeping. Deeply, with all their heart, Babies sleep at night, They sleep merrily - some in a cradle, some in a stroller. Let them have a dream Where on the Moon, on the Moon The Moon Bear reads fairy tales aloud, The Moon Bear reads fairy tales aloud. For those who can't sleep, I'll tell you a secret One amazing fact: I count stars, but the stars are countless It truly is like that. Look through the telescopes and keep discovering Other worlds and places. But there has to be good weather On planet Earth. High, high up there Someone had spilled milk, And created the Milky Way And along it, along it, Between the pearl fields, The Moon swims like a white canoe. And on the Moon, on the Moon, On the blue boulder, Moon people are watching, they don't take their eyes off How above the Moon, above the Moon The blue globe, our globe Beautifully sets and rises. Beautifully sets and rises. Subtitled by Little Red Spirit THE END
