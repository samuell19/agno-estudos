Scusa! Scusa! Do you speak English? Oh, fine! Perhaps you can tell us where we are! In Rimini! Rimini? Where is that exactly? To the North! Half way between Ancona and Venice! Incredible! Here, have a nip! Are you English? Oh, thank God for that! You think we could find a mechanic up the way? - Oh, l'm sure you can! - Ah, marvellous! And how is this small town? I really don't know, ma'am. I too only got here today. I am sorry. INDIAN SUMMER Actually, we expected you on Monday. - Some setback? - No. May l ask you why you chose Rimini? - Because l had never been here. - Oh-oh! - And is it a good enough reason, according to you? - Yes. - Ah... Let's see! Dominici. Domini... Dominici? By chance, are you son, or nephew, of the hero of El Alamein? Pardon me? l asked if you were a relative of the famous colonel Dominici, by chance... gold medal of "La Folgore". - No, nothing to do with him. Well, then, Dominici, born in... Vienna. Aged 37, graduated with honors at the Catholic University of Milan... doctoral in History of the Art... ltalian school of Mogadishu from 1959 to '60... Agrigento in 1963. Forgive me, but, what did you do in those three years when you didn't teach? - l sold books in installments. - Then you must be a connoisseur! Good! Mobile school in Sardinia, another period of leave. At any rate, your personal notes don't say much... they're normal, they're without infamy nor praise. lt doesn't seem, to me, that you have... let's say, the vocation for education. lt's likely. Today, the high school... is on strike. This is, so to speak, another face of freedom! Come, come... l'll show you the school. After you... There! This is your classroom. I'm not telling you more, because l want you to make your own personal opinion. Do know, however, that in my school there's no room for protest... nor for the thoughts of President Mao. Therefore, choose the methods you deem best, but maintain the discipline. 19... 19... 19... 19... 19... 23... 5... 5... 25! And 51! How lucky you are! l owe you 20,000 lire. Come, pay now! - Why do you credit Leo and not me? - Leo doesn't have money, and you do. - Eh! - 20,000! Well? What's up guys, are you afraid? - 20,000 only? Leo! - No, l don't feel like it. Besides, l don't have a penny. - Doctor? - Ah... Darn! For once that l have a lucky night! Come on, Marcello! 20,000! l've got no luck today! l'm not giving you another 20,000. Then, what are we going to do? It's barely 6 pm! Where do we go? To pee in Marina? - Come on guys! Bank 20,000. - Bank! Sorry, but l don't play with people l don't know. Don't mind him... he's a spoiled little hick! Montanari. - Doctor Malvestiti... - Pleased. - Lello Bazzoni... - How goes it? and this is the Marcello... - Hello. OK. Tuck that money away. With the marshal, we are hand-in-glove, but... the owner doesn't want to see money on the table. Giorgio Mosca! AKA "Spider", for friends. - 20,000? - Even more, if you want. Let's start with 20... Your lead. - What did you say your name was? - Dominici. And what are you doing around here? We've never seen you. l teach at the high school here. Ah! Out. Damn! You're good at it, professor! - Bank of 40? - Bank. What else can you play? Anything. Is it possible that l never find him at home? Did you tell him that l called since 5 or 6 days already? Tell him to please call me at any time in the morning! Thank you. Yes, Dominici. You asleep? Do you have matches? Try not to think of it, you'll see it'll pass. l'm telling you from experience. Now it seems unbearable, but it passes. Everything passes. - Then what does one live for? - One survives. - Are you upset at me? - Never crossed my mind. - Some things just happen. - Did they happen to you? No, not seriously. Not for my merit... in case, by fault of the women l met. Have you loved me much? Monica, it seems that we are here to watch the dead. Do you have any regrets? Too much luxury! l won't afford it. Would you want a son? Woe be to God! And to make what of him? Sleep. What annoys me most with you, is your damned goodness! lt would kill an ox! lt's not goodness. "Second, we ask to have recognized our right to debate our problems. " "Third, we also ask that, as in many high schools... " Good morning, my name is Dominici. l'm your new professor. Good morning professor. We were setting up an agenda. May we finish? - Sure. - Thanks. "Third, we also ask that, as in many high schools of Rome... " Milan, Turin, Genoa, Florence, etc..... students may have a class council... and may participate in the discussion for the quarterly rating. That's it. lt must be approved also by the Science and Normal schools. Later, tell Roberto to compose it with fonts larger than usual... and to have the layout ready by tomorrow. Would you sign it, professor? - What's your name? - Fabrizio Romani. You have a formidable grade average: 9, 8, 7, 8, 9. - How old are you? - 19 next June. - What does your father do? - He's a veterinarian. He works for the City. - A match? - Sure. lt's your business. l don't want to mingle with it. - Many other professors have signed it. - Their business. l'm only here to explain why a line of Petrarch is beautiful... and l presume to know how to do it. The rest is foreign to me, and boring, l might as well tell you right away. To me, blacks or reds, you're all alike. The blacks are more stupid. l'll have to spend only 3 or 4 months with you... the time it takes for the femur of Professor Mariano to heal. l'm not in great shape because it's been a while that l haven't taught. They tell me that a lot of things have changed... but l have my views on teaching:... not to impose it on anyone. ln the sense that, if someone wants to study, l am here... the others do as they please: come, come not, read, write... play Naval Battle... Provided they do not disturb. - Professor, may we smoke? - Yes, certainly! Today is Thursday, we have 3 consecutive hours. What did he usually do, Professor Mariano? - Class-work! - Fine, l'll give you a composition. Since you're many, and in such a short time l will have no way to know all... you'd better introduce yourselves. Write what you want. Talk about your private life, the family... your sorrows, joys, mistakes made, anything. lf you want, you may not sign. lt means it will take me longer to understand. However, if you don't write with sincerity, it's a wasted effort. For those who want to remain in the tradition, another theme: the opposition of purity and sin in the world of Alessandro Manzoni. So... begin! Write, and... try not to make noise while l'm out. The "Figaro Litt√©raire" and "Newsweek". 600. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Professor Dominici! - Pardon? Will you explain me why you're not in the classroom? l went down to buy some newspapers. The boys have a class-work. And you leave them like that, without supervision? You must be joking? Why? What can happen? Now you'll see for yourself. Come. Your class is the most turbulent of the whole school. Romani, go to your place. - Who gave you permission to smoke? - l did. Put out the cigarettes immediately. - ln many schools it is allowed. - Not in this one! That's a bad start, professor Dominici! Pass by me at the end of the lesson! - May we smoke, Professor? - Yes, certainly. What's the matter? You have no cigarettes? Here. - Handed in already? - No. - So why don't you write? - l've already finished. What are you reading? - lnterested? - Not really. - Did they recommend it to you? - No, l won it at the bingo. - And what is bingo? - A lottery. Do you know anything else by Lawrence? "Lady Chatterley's Lover". - Who is the brigade's would-be wit? - Me, professor. What other books by Lawrence do you know? He said it, "Lady Chatterley's Lover". Abati Vanina. Vanina... There is a novel with the same title. l know, "Vanina Vanini". They also made an old movie out of it. - Did you see it? - No! Strange, l see you did the Manzoni theme. - We could choose, right? - Yes, certainly. Are there others who have developed the Manzoni theme? Apparently you are the only one. - ls it a topic that interests you? - lt seemed better than the other. Talking about oneself, one always finds something to say. l preferred this one. Bye. - Abati! - Yes? - Come here. Did professor Mariano always interrogate you from the form? Almost all the teachers. - Does it embarrass you here? - No, it's the same. - How old are you? - 19, almost 20. l see you do a lot of absences. Voluntary ones? Some of them. Your parents don't care that you attend regularly? l only have my mother, and she couldn't care less. Do you have brothers, or sisters? A sister, but she is married, and not living with us. And you're sorry about that. Yes. What do you want to do, at the University? Nothing. l'm not even sure l want to complete the year. lt would be a shame to quit, it's just a few more months. - What do you want to do next? - To go abroad. - And do what? - Whatever. You didn't have a bad start, this quarter. - Do you like ltalian? - Quite. "Oh sleep, oh, of the sweet, damp, shady night placid son;"... "oh, of the mortal ailing comfort, sweet oblivion of such grave ills"... "whence life is hard and boring. " l do not want to know whose they are, but if you like them. Yes. Try to guess a name and age. - Leopardi? - 300 years earlier... but you have a good ear anyway. lt's Monsignor Della Casa. - Do you read much? - No. You re-registered after a 2 years interval. Have you been sick? Look guys, l'm not very patient. - You go to the movies often? - Every day. - What kind of film do you like? - Those that make me laugh. - And what else interests you in life? - Sports cars! Get out. Why, now? l don't know why yet, but you certainly do. - l don't understand... - You do, don't worry. Get out, don't make me angry. You may go back to the bench. Hi, come in. Hi. Hello! - Do you work here? - Also. lf you want to buy a house, l'll make you a good price. Whose guests are we tonight? Mah... There would be the flat in Viale Trento... but if we mess up, they'll hear us immediately. - Or? - Or... Villa Ortensia. No, there is not even a lousy stove! Last time, l lost 300,000 lire because my balls had frozen. Or the Ferri's house, 4 rooms plus services. l've been trying to rent it for 3 years, to no avail. lt can be heated, but the bathroom doesn't work. When you pull the flush, there is an explosion of shit. - Who's coming? - Us three, Leo and Gerardo. Big Scrotum will join us later. Who is Gerardo? Gerardo Pavani, one who's full of dough. You must have seen him, no? He always goes to pick Vanina up at school. - lsn't she in your class? - Yes. Well, okay for Viale Trento! - Did you bring the drinks? - Yes, 3 bottles of whiskey in the car. - And to eat? - Leo! And the cards? - Ah, good! Shall we go? - Let's go. After you, professor. l open. Times 3. l pass. - lt says times 6. - Okay for 6. Game. - Cards. - One. Two. - Valeria! - Yes? Give the blessing! - Move away! - Why? - l don't want people behind. - Valeria? - Yes? - Check! - 10,000. - 30.000. - Fold. - Call. - 60,000. - 100,000. - Fold. Okay, just because l don't want to punish you. - Full. - Not enough. - How much do l owe you? - ln all, 200,000. Will you change it to 15 days? Give it to him. Sure, and what can l do with it? Put it in a frame? Sooner or later it'll be good. - Nello, go and play at my place. - Ugh! Excuse me! - Nobody cares for formalities. - Marcello? How much can it be worth? - Where did you swipe it? - lt's clean, l won it at a game. The stone is not bad. Too bad there is this engraving, it's worth a bit less. How much would you give me? l don't deal with these things. Let me see. - M-A-S. And who are they? - What do l know? Cards. - 30,000 okay? - More or less. - Valeria! - Yes? - Here! - Ah, is it for me? - Yes. - And you? What will you give me? - Not what you want. - Sooner or later... - Better later! - Go play! - What do you want? - Now l tell you! What did you bring her for? To show her? Ugly slut, you also take... - You're hurting me! - Come on... - Fold. - Cards. Check. One. Vanina told me that you made her a third degree interrogation. She also made me understand that you had noticed her. l noticed that she does not seem very happy. Two. l have been telling her to quit for a year! What does she need it for? Anyway, treat her well. Ah! Don't blurt out that we met. l am in Turin. Here. The other Vanina. ls it for me? Sure it is for you, but you must read it. Sure. - ls it a good story? - Yes! She is a Roman princess, and he a fugitive Carbonaro. - And they love each other. - Yes. Lucky them! Thank you. - Your boyfriend? - He's in Turin. Want me to take you somewhere? For me it's early. l realize it is not in its best shape. lt's probably a year since l last washed it. But it's losing petrol? Aren't you afraid that it might catch fire? lt could burn for a minute, l put only 1,000 lire at a time. - Where do you live? - ln Bellaria. - What does your boyfriend do? - He should be in the service. He always succeeds in postponing it. He seems to be very rich. ls it the Miura that makes you think so? He would have it even if he were poor. - Will you two marry soon? - Why all these questions just for me? We'll never get married. - Happy? - Yes - Don't you want me to take you home? - l'm not going home. - Do you regret that your boyfriend is in Turin? - But he is not in Turin. - Where, then? - Who knows. Hidden in some hotel, with one of his conquests by 50,000. They're beautiful girls, you know? - And you don't care? - l never did. lt means that you're not so much in love. That's probably so. - What will you do you if you don't go home? - l'll slip in a cinema. lt will take another couple of hours before opening time. l'll wait. Do you mind if l wait with you? But, aren't you busy? Yes. There is one thing that l want to do since a long time. - Had you ever been here? - No. lt had to be me to let you discover the wonders of this thing. - l bet l know what you're thinking. - Let's hear it. - You feel sorry to see them prisoners. - A little. lnstead, l think that if they'd put them back to sea, they'd soon die... of nostalgia... for their nice pool, with lunch and dinner assured. There's nothing like the lack of freedom to give you some gusts of gaiety. - Always like that? - Always. lt's a miracle l didn't involve the bread. What time is it? 2:30 p.m. Your film will begin shortly. You really want to go there? l'm not going to the movie. - Do you lie often? - When necessary. And you? When essential. l must take a train. - Aren't you asking me where l'm going? - No. To my sister's. She is married and has two children, but does not have an easy life. - Where does she live? - At Monterchi. At Monterchi there is one of the finest paintings of the Renaissance. l know, the "Madonna del Parto". But l've never seen it. There it is! ln 1460, the peasant community of Monterchi... ordered to Piero this Madonna. The authors of the commission were not popes, nor princes nor bankers... and it may be that at the beginning, Piero took the job a little lightly. Despite this... here's the miracle of this adolescent peasant, proud as a King's daughter. The silence of the countryside around her is so accomplished. Until now probably she amused herself by confiding with her animals. She calls them by their names... and laughs! Then suddenly it's all over... because, through the centuries, fate has chosen right her purity. She seems aware of it, but not happy. Maybe she already feels obscurely that the mysterious life growing in her... will end on a Roman cross, like that of a malefactor. And centuries later, the great poet will address her with these sublime words: "Virgin Mother, daughter of thy Son,"... "Humbler and higher above all creatures, Fixed aim and goal of the eternal plan... " "You are the one who lifted human nature To such nobility that its own Maker"... "Did not disdain to be made of its making. " Probably, she wouldn't even have understood. You would like to have a child? You seem all to agree to ask me the same question. Eh... good Lord! l no longer have the will, nor the courage, nor the imagination! l forgot too many things. You can tell me, you're starting now. ls there a moment in life, when two people love each other... that they want to have a child? - l don't know. Although it is not true that l'm starting now. Two people in love with each other... That's it, perhaps... otherwise what remains is just a body that warps. lt remains only discomfort, pain... the cruelty of the people who become aware... without there being nothing to do anymore. Or almost. Sad again? No. Just a little disappointed. All day long l said to myself that you were different from all others. But taking this route, l bet against myself... and l was not asking but to lose. l thought: "He will stop right in this stretch without streetlights". Maybe l did even worse. l knew that this morning you were alone... and l looked for you. Even the Stendhal book might be a scheme. - How did you know that l was alone? - Your friends told me. - Who? Spider, Leo and Marcello. Some friends, those! - l imagine what they said about me. - Not a word. But l didn't look for you for an evening of fun. These things do not interest me. But the discomfort in you, your sadness without remedy... l cannot stand them. But you don't know anything about me. l know what l want to know. Stop! What am l going to tell him now? How am l going to do? Forgive me. Please, forgive me. Two mozzarelle in carriage and two braciole, OK? l'll send the boy immediately. Good evening. - Good evening. - 'evening. - Hi. - Hello! - Who's there? - Nello. He's ripping off some wholesale pork vendors. - And the others? - Leo is with a Swiss old girl with a lesbian friend... Gerardo is on his own... and Spider has a lot of people at the "New World". - Want something to eat? - No, l'll finish the wine. Something going wrong? But will you quit pretending to understand everything at first glance... when you'll never actually understand anything about anything? lt's a sixth sense that comes to those who live in the province. - Come to the "New World" to find Spider. Usually one can pick up, there. - Mh! God, what a mess! Marcello! How are you, ugly fag? And you, you old slut? - You are Daniele, right? - Come here you, big bitch! I heard a lot about you. Come, the table is there. - How's things with the headmaster? - And who ever sees him! He's a pig! l was expelled from school because l did not let him touch my ass. Not that l mind. lt is he who disgusts me... with that empty little sleeve and the black glove. He's only got one hand, but he doesn't hold firm not even if they tie it! Good boys! Thank goodness you're here! Wish me happy birthday, l'm 26! l feel decrepit! Did you see what a mess l made? Professor, see what kind of goods the firm sells! Eh? Drink! Drink! - Why don't you make him dance? - l'm waiting for him to ask me. This stuff? And who is capable? - Then dance with me! - l don't want to be found on the dance floor... with someone struck by an infarct. Come and sit. She doesn't want to let you go! Take advantage! To me, it would seem to go to bed with Gianni Agnelli... but there are those who like it! - Ugh! Rosy! Rosy where are you? Whore! - Daniele. - Good evening! Do you like her? Vanina? Who else? Don't play dumb! Sure! - She's beautiful, isn't she? - Very. But awkward, l warn you... You too think you know everything at first sight? What does this mean, say! Ask around. Much past, little present... no future. Hello! - Want to dance? - No, thanks. - Why won't you dance? - l'm tired! Then, like nothing, he'll flunk you. You see? He talks, talks, then he's always back on the run... with his tongue out! - What will it be? - A whiskey and Gauloises. - How come you didn't want to dance? - l've already told you, l was tired. And how come you were tired? Don't be assholes! But we are assholes! Guys, l've had enough. Why not change place, eh? Come on, Gerardo, sit down and don't break our balls! - Let's all go to my house, mh? - Why? Because it's your birthday, and we're going to celebrate. - But if you've never invited us! - Well, this is the right time. Well? Do we go? As far as me... let's go! Barman, my jacket! l'm leaving! So, Professor, are we going? Oh, look... You didn't let slip anything on last night, right? Oh, yes! Today you had no lesson. Stop touching my ass, you asshole! - Move! And make less noise! - May l come in? He installed himself like a pasha in the most beautiful apartment... he half emptied the pantry, when they made an inventory of the kitchen... they found out that he'd drunk down 500 bottles of champagne! - Not stupid! - Can we have a little light? What a big head! This is the satellite of morons. All the Bolognese have bought it. - And this would be the small apartment? - Ah! lt's 100 square meters! Have a seat! Vanina, offer a drink! So, you like? l don't know yet. l don't understand how it came to your mind to make you a house like this. lt was an architect from Milan that we met last year at the Lido. - A fag! - Here, light up. Vanina liked him right away, so l told him:... "Here, this is the money, and l want to find the house nice and ready". Well, at first he did a lot of stories... then l found him a nice big hustler in a construction yard at Porto Verde... and since then, he came here every other day. The only trouble is that the house is full of buttons. l don't know, you want a Coke, and out comes an electric razor! You've got two bedrooms? One. l'm not planning to start a family! - This way? - No, come on, let it be, it's all a mess! A battlefield of Roncesvalles. ls there any book that interests you? Spider told me that you write poetry. ls that true? - And what does Spider know about it? - Eh, eh... Spider knows much more than you think. Assholes! Did you read "Centomila gavette di ghiaccio"? lt's a smasher. Take it. - Who'll give me a match? - Here! - There is a lighter there. - What the fuck is that? - Movies! For rainy evenings. - And the films? - You rent them. Some films, you can buy them, if you wish. - At Copenaghen? - Nah! Even closer! At Genova! At Rimini, even! Do you have any Danish stuff? Let's see! Come on, there are ladies here! We take no offense. Unfortunately, they just make me laugh. Really? Last year l saw one of those funny films... lf l showed you some funny films that l know... Come on, don't give us the shits! Let's see this movie! Vanina, make another round. You know what l tell you? l want to buy one too! Something to drink for me too, please. - Here too, Vanina! - Thanks. How Long does it take to load the film? Where do you turn off the light? - Well? Are we ready? - Ready! Ah, there we are. Go! - Hey! - Let me sit down. The Gerardo Film presents "Seven pricks for seven fucking cunts"! - But what's on your mind? - Shut up! - But who do you think cares?! - Let's see. lf there is someone who cares, raise your hand. - l do! - l want to see everything! Well, then... What do we do? Okay... Guys, Vanina is nervous. What do we do? Show us the stuff you've got, not the... honeymoon! No, no, it's late now. Now we all go to sleep. Okay? Okay, got it. - Elvira, l will follow you in turn. - Then come on, come on! Stairs, even in the house! Let's go! Bye. Ah, professor! lt's your check. l don't need it, it hinders me. lt means that if we play again, you owe me 200,000. Goodnight! ‚ô™We are the little gypsies, we came from far away!‚ô™ ‚ô™We are the little gypsies, we came from far away!‚ô™ Sing with me! ‚ô™We are the little gypsies, we're-going-for-a-walk!‚ô™ Will you give me a ride, professor? l'm sorry, but... l'm afraid l don't have gas. lt still marks a quarter. lt also marks that l don't want to accompany you. Certainly tonight you had to swallow a nice glass of shit, right professor? ‚ô™...who goes all alone into the night!‚ô™ Hey, come on blonde, l'll take you through the maze of hell! Come! Get in, bitch! Monica! Monica! But what's up? Open... Then? You scared me. How come you're still up? Nothing, l fell asleep watching TV. And l woke up when the presenter said goodnight. Since then... l have not slept a wink. Did you loose again? l didn't even play. l think it's yours. - Did you read it? - Just a glance. You shouldn't have! lt's not written it is for you. lt carefully avoids naming you. And you replied in the same tone? l asked you if you replied in the same tone! Oh! Get out there! You've drunk! - What are you doing? - l asked you a question! Yes. And on the phone? And on the phone also, as l did with you, in the early times. And the times you make love to me, do you think of him? Answer me! l just make love, l don't care. l just make love, and that's it. Undress! Think about who the fuck you want, just shut up! - You're hurting me! - Shut up! No! No! Nooo! No! No! Don't stop! No! Don't stop! No! Don't stop... Go and answer, it must be for you. Let it ring... Go and answer! Let it ring... Let me go! One coffee. No. She's not home. l told you, l've been there. - Hello, Professor! - Good morning, Professor! - Good morning, Professor! - Hi! - Hello? - Hello, is it you, Vanina? - Hello? Vanina, it's Daniele. Vanina! - Who are you looking for? - My name is Dominici. - l'd like to speak to miss Abati. - She's not there. What did you want? l should speak to her. This morning she didn't come to class. Do you not know where l could find her? - Who are you? - l'm her professor. - Ah. - What did you say your name is? - Dominici. My daughter took off an hour ago. Come in. - l wouldn't want to bother, madam. - Come in! l too have something to say! Excuse me, l have something on the stove. Be right back. Here l am to you. So, say. - Vanina will discontinue the studies? - Yes, l spoke to Dean this morning. l said l preferred to withdraw her for health reasons. - And the real reason? - l don't like that she's around all day long. l do not like the environment. Then, in our parts, a woman does not need to have studied. - Your daughter, what does she think? - She agrees. l'm sorry if l disturbed, madam. Take off some ideas from your head, professor. Vanina is no stuff for you, and she's fine as she is. So do not look for her, do not phone her... do nothing. You may pass some trouble. - Vanina agrees on this too? - Sure. Do not trust appearances, you might get burned. An infatuation doesn't really change anything. And even before leaving, she and her boyfriend were laughing over it. Pavani might have his faults, sometimes he's rough... but l know my daughter, trouble if you leave the bridle on her neck. Do you know that Gerardo Pavani has no intention of marrying her? And who told you? lf Vanina knows what to do, she will take her boyfriend where she wants. However, this does not concern you! lndeed. Good evening. None of your business, you ugly bastard! And woe if l know you keep haunting her! Today that idiot blurted everything out to her boyfriend... and l labored all day to make peace and make them go off together! lt will not be a beggar like you to ruin everything! Toe the line, you son of a bitch, or l'll make you end up in a hospital! - Were you looking for me? - No. Did l do well? How did you do with the money? A system of mine. - Gambled? - Mh-mh. - Did you win? - l found today in the mailbox. - lt's for you, right? Read. Read, read. - Why do you laugh? - Should l cry? - Is it true? - An anonymous letter is never true. - This is the second. - Habits and customs of the place. Today l looked for "Vanina Vanini". l couldn't find it. Where is it? - I gave it away. - When? Yesterday. To Vanina Abati, l suppose. Precisely. Do you really like her? Yes. - What happened between you and her? - Nothing. Nothing at all? She left school, l will not see her again. - lt is true that she's a whore? - Will you go on questioning for much longer? - l want to sleep. - You? lf you never sleep! So let's say l'm bored. What now? lt's dark, l can return the favor. Go on, keep thinking of her! - lt's good, right? - Monica, l'm sorry but l am not an object... of your exclusive property. - Shut up! - Stop! You, your crisis solved, do not give a damn for other people's ones. Oh, l'm not jealous! l'm not jealous of you, go to bed with whoever you like. Whores, ladies, kids or men! What irritates me is this air of perturbation that runs through the house. lt does not concern me and l don't admit it. When it concerned you, l never drove you mad. lt's true. You should have done it instead. Would it have been any good? No. You see? Go to bed. Do you want to make love so much? A mad desire. Since last night l have been thinking of nothing else. l regret. What does it cost you to share her with me? Stupid! You're cynical enough to do it! Moreover, it is not the first time. Professor, l drove all over Rimini to find you. What have you been doing lately? Did you change group or are you hiding? - l meditate. - Exactly! But Spider, seer and magician, came here to propose you an exceptional evening. - What, your birthday again? - No, Elvira's... who, since when you treated her badly, is drooling to get her hands on you. - Wow! ls it yours? - Yes, sir! - And where can you do 340 per hour? - Nowhere. Say, will you let me try it? - Do you know how to drive it? - Certainly not! Then climb in. But where have you brought me? Move! You'll grow mushrooms on the ass by dint of sitting in the car! What is it? An abandoned house. This house was called "La Querciaia" lmagine... There... there was also a small theater. All to rack and ruin. Was it your home? No. l knew the people who lived here. One of the daughters drowned at Conero. Since then the family no longer came. They let everything go to ruin. But it was not just for that. lt was a family tainted by hereditary defects... eaten for generations by syphilis and insanity. They let themselves die slowly, in this rotten cemetery. All rotten, destroyed, shattered. And how did you know them? Either it is all a sham... or, flat-broke as you must have been since then... l really can't picture you hanging out in these halls. Some uncles of mine had a house at Recanati, not far away. On summer we came here, a whole group of youngsters. l talk about 20 years ago. We started on a bike and went for a swim in Santa Maria Portonovo... or at the ship's wreck, that bow ravaged by rust... that is still planted in front of the beach. What was the name of the girl who drowned? What? lHer name. What was her name. You know l can not remember any more? - Don't take the piss out of me! - Calm down, Spider... Let's go. Why did you want to come then? Don't make up a romance, as usual. lf l had not met you with your new Ferrari... it would have never occurred to me. Come. Every so often come to mind... memories without reason. "He whom you seek is not here" "He is risen, as he said, the third day. " "Go, he has preceded you into Galilee. There you will find him". Are you a Christian? l'm an atheist. Come, get in! Fuck, the same old negress! Who found her? Fleca! She's a French woman from Martinique. - Her name? - Boccadolce . Ah, meet Mirta Cocaine, she too is from the Crazy Horse. Yeah! From Bagnacavallo! - Oh, asshole! - Shut up, bitch! The kiss of forgiveness! A scotch. Will you fix it, Spider? "Embarkation for Cythera"... For you, later, eh? Don't be an asshole, Spider! He's already slow as a cart with square wheels! l said later. Martine! Yes! This is the famous Daniele. ls it him you'd be disagreeable to? l have yet to be forgiven because one night l did not dance with her. Martine and l know each other since long. We always liked the same people. Let me see. Come, l'll read your fate. Use some more, they begin to loosen. Take care of it yourself. - Where is Demetria? - Never knew a Demetria. lt says here that you're very rich. Couldn't be more wrong! lt doesn't say how, but the hand's lines are never wrong. - Are you making friends? - Do not meddle, you! - That's what l'm here for. l see many travels. You travel by sea, right? ln the past. Then l see a long one in the future, which brings you to places unknown. l see the sign of fire. - What does it mean? - That there is fire in your life. You are an artist. You can be very sad. lf you don't like something, no one can make you do it. We'll make so that you like it... Then there is a great dark. But that, l don't know what it means. ls it correct? Bullshit! Want to see how l read... present, past and future of my friend? Spider, don't rush! First we'll train him a bit. Mind your fucking business, bitch! Oh God! Oh God! l took a guess and l hit the bull's eye! Spider is a fag and he is falling in love! Come on, tell me what you see. What is the lndian Summer? The Saint Martin summer, the last flowering before winter. Hush, let him answer! Why is death the first night of quiet? Because finally one sleeps without dreams. - Are you sure? - Mh-mh. - Who is the ferryman of the dead? - Charon, jackass. Why do you pay a donation to the caretaker of the Shrine of Nembi? lf you visit a museum, you pay the ticket. l've tricked you, professor, say the truth! You didn't expect it, huh? "But there is no path to the meeting... that would be sweeter than life, my dear". To us you had to leave the fierce decision... that hides you behind inviolable borders of cold. "To Livia, a year after". Why? The puzzle is almost complete, Professor, but it is missing a piece. You can play and plunder these goats, but not me! Forgive me. Fix it a bit. No. Don't break my balls, Spider. No, l don't have it anymore. Let go! No! Laisse-moi, salaud! No! Daniele! - But what the fuck do you want? - Go fuck off! There is someone waiting for you in my car. The keys are there. When did you come back? An hour ago, l took the first train. Would you keep me with you? Marcello left me the keys to a house. Let's go there. Vanina, open! - But what do you want to do? - lt's my fucking busibess! Christ, he won't listen! The car is here because it wouldn't start! But try it yourself! - And even if you find her, what would you do? - Shut up! Vanina! Vanina, open! Vanina, open! How could they arrive, swimming? Open, I said! Don't worry. You are a poor wretch who delights only to be a pimp! - But be careful, you'll pay for this! - But what have l got to do?! - Open! - But, Gerardo, Marcello is right, he told the truth! - Oh yeah? And where are the keys? - Enough, guys! Let's go home! Who told you to come?! Get the fuck out of my way, you'll do me a favor! l'm not moving from here. Vanina! What, are you afraid? Vanina, open! What do you want? ls Vanina here? Get in. Hi. Hi. Did you see? l tracked you down quickly. You forced me to do the highway at 250 per hour. l had left you a letter, didn't you find it? Some things must be said by voice. - Why didn't you? - To avoid being pummeled. - Listen, l would like to talk to Vanina, alone. - No! Quiet, Vanina runs no risk. Okay! Did you enjoy the holiday? - l came to take you back. - Too late, Gerardo. Because of him? But you barely know him. So what? Does that change anything? Vanina, l won't reproach you for anything. lt happened, amen! l too have many wrongs. We won't speak about this anymore, okay? Now stop it and come back home. - Have you brought witnesses? - Exactly! To make an asshole of myself! No, they only came because they were afraid l would harm you... but the thought never crossed my mind. Come. You did not understand. - l have nothing to do with you, anymore. - Okay. You have a crush on this starving piece of shit! So what? lt is not the first time! These things pass! We are together since years. - ln which way? - ln all ways! Not just in bed! Do you really want to know why l have been with you for years? For your money! You got me used to have it and spend it! You could have done something for me, after what had happened. But l was only a part time mistress, who could be unceremoniously kicked out! This only. For the money, and because l was dying of shame. Go away Gerardo, it's better. lf l were you, l wouldn't intrude. - So... you never loved me. - Never! - Not even in Venice? - No! You scared me! - And during the nine days in Madrid? - You talked about years, not days! Did you tell him how we spent our time? He can imagine it. And in Paris? And at our place?! - But you see... - Let go, you idiot, l'm not crying for these memories! Marry me. l beg you, and l won't live but for you. I ask your forgiveness. You mustn't. You must not beg, especially in front of him. Do you realize how my life will be if l lose you?! lt is not a fight, a whim... or a vendetta. l'm in love. Can't you understand that? But how did he enchant you, this half shitty fag? What does he have that l don't? This? He spoke to me. And did he tell you where he lived in Turin... in 1955, from January to June? ln jail! For bad checks and fraud! You can get his references from the police! You are a coward. As if l cared anything. You, then, how many centuries of prison should you do? And Marcello, a smuggler? And Spider, with false prescriptions? And everything else! Go away. Worse for him. Daniele, no! Gerardo, stop! Enough! Stop! Enough! Please do not hit him again! Let's go, Gerardo. You wanted to be reasonable, and try to be it all the way. Let's go... l'm not through with you. Watch out, you idiot! You'll see how many times she'll disappear from under the nose... because she takes a crush and makes the grand gesture to change her life. You're not the first. Sooner or later she'll begin to tell tales to you too... while she gets screwed by another asshole who stoned her with chatter! - Let's go, come. - You can't change her, she's rotten! And you understood it yourself! Nothing easier! Just tell her "l love you", and her panties are gone. You've hardly finished speaking, that she opens her thighs... worse than if she took the pills that Spider passes us! - Stop it! Enough! - Come on, hit me! Ask around, dickhead, there is people who risked the jail for her! You don't know from what sewer this one came out! Her mother was the worst slut of the coast! All of us have started out with her! We brought her behind the sports field and fucked her for a pack of cigarettes! Breeding will out! - Let go! - Enough! - l'll kill you! Gerardo! Wait! Since you're at it, why not tell all? l would have done myself, but l haven't had the courage. Four years have passed, you don't run any risks now. Careful, cutie! Careful! We paid good money not to run them, the risks! This gives you more discomfort to confess, right? Then you're forgetting one thing: l wasn't there, l came later... when being seen with you was like having the mange... being smeared at first sight! - All he needs is to mention your name in a bar, to get the full report! - Enough! Let's go away. Then why did you give her the keys, asshole? But have you finally understood, moron? Look at them well, one by one, they all had a pass at her! Elvira included! And Marcello had come to me and said: "l've got one who's not even 15 and she's smashing!". And the apartment of Bellaria, how turned it out? With the touch of a magic wand? No, sir! Madame Abati presented a fat fee for her silence! And we, or whoever for us, have paid! And kept quiet! Out of here. Get off my balls! Hands off, syphilitic faggot! You too, out! - Listen, l... - Out! lf you want, l'm going. Come to me here. - Are you afraid? - Very. - How will she take it? - Badly. - Does she love you? - Yes, in her way. Here it is. Daniele, don't go. Don't go to her, you'll write her. lt's the same, right? Please, don't go back in town. l'm afraid. ln a few hours l'll be with you and we'll leave. l dont know where to, but we'll leave. Come. l love you! Hi! Hi. - l make some coffee? - No, thanks. Last night, the phone must have rung 20 times. - Were they looking for you or her? - Her, probably. Have you decided to leave? Yes. - And me, didn't you think of me? - For a long time. And what have you concluded? lt is rightly, so for the good of both. We're together not even out of habit anymore, but out of desperation. Even staying together out of desperation could mean a lot. Why then didn't you leave me three months ago? Because l knew that dull little boy would have dumped you... after he had taken his pleasure. You'd be left alone... and it had to be me to give you a hand. That's all. Why should it be any different for you? Daniele, at our age they give us things just so they can take them back again. How can you still have such illusions? Does it seem so absurd? You are incapable of love as you are of remorse. Think of Livia. Tell the truth on the angelic creature that no one is worthy of mentioning! You have idealized a paranoid girl... only to take refuge, from time to time, in an oasis of pain... and write over 50 ugly poems on her! The picture is yours. Don't be cheated when you sell it. And, how will you do? l'll get by. Oh, for that, she might help with some quickie. They say she's very good at it! Thank you. You're making things easier on me. And you believe it ends like that? No, you're not gonna make me mad! You're not getting rid of me with your silence and your lordly education! l'd rather kill myself. You've threatened that often. Sure, because living next to you, l was suffocating! l endured you for 10 years just because l pitied you! - You believe that l have betrayed you once only? - Never presumed, Monica. l have betrayed you always! ln all these years, and with whom it happened! And even while you were at home, in the next room! And now what? l go back to Mogadishu and show up to my husband... after 10 years, bare-assed, and l beg him to take me back? I am no longer young. l don't want to end up alone like a dog! So long. Wait! This time, l'll find the courage! l have nothing dear on which to swear, but l swear the same! lf you leave this house, l open the gas and kill myself. lt means that, for hatred, you will have made me the ultimate possible evil. l'll kill you! Daniele! Daniele! Marcello! Quick, help me! Let's put him up! And so, we got a beating. - Where are we? - At Marcello's house. What do l have? A little as if you'd gone under a train. A cracked rib and... ln short, a little upside down everywhere. But it is less serious than it seemed. - Help me... - What do you want to do? - Where do you want to go? - To Vanina. We tried to inform her, but we didn't find her... she was gone from Misano. She's at Monterchi, at her sister's. Why not wait until tomorrow? We'll inform her. Find me a drink. lHere. Better now... much better. Why didn't you take me to the hospital? lt would have risen a historical mess... and the first name to pop out would have been that of Vanina. Fear of being blackmailed again? Here... your checks. l've bought them back from Fleca. - Why? - Because they didn't cost too much... and then l think he too made a big deal. The way the wind is blowing, he was likely not to take anything. - How much do l owe you? - Nothing. - How, nothing? - Nothing, am l speaking Turkish? How much money do you have? 100,000 lire. You can do nothing with 100,000 lire! See, l try to corrupt you so you forgive me. You're doing just right. Can you give them to my wife? Marcello tried to call her, but found the line always busy. - Busy? - Yes. - Want me to try again? - No. Go there as soon as l leave. Okay. How did you unearth it? Spider, seer and magician, has infinite powers, is very curious. Livia was my young cousin. She died at age 16. The year after l wrote these poems. Why do you write "The haughty gesture of cowardice or courage''? Because she killed herself. And this? "l get a letter from the green English countryside." My father. He died at war, in Africa. Gold medal. God, how a man's life is full of deads! l'm going. Wait, l'll help you. May God protect you. He's got else to do. l filled her up. Quite an event! A fill of gasoline, a lot of money... l leave with all the blessings! The suitcase is behind. "Therefore..." "our everlasting farewell take. " "For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!" "lf we do meet again, why, we shall smile"... "lf not, why then"... "this parting was well made. " You are a man of good readings. Fuck off! Bye. Operator, please, unlock the 301-10 of Rimini. 301-10? One moment, please. Hurry, please, it's very urgent! Sorry, sir. The set is faulty or the receiver is out of place. l rang the doorbell twice, l knocked, but she must be out. Don't worry. Go back there, please. Go there and, if she doesn't answer, break down the door. Now, please! - What's wrong? - Nothing. - Feeling ill? - No. Go, l'll join you right away. Spider: Sometimes they come to mind... of memories without reason. ''He whom you seek is not here'. Daniel: ''He is risen, as he said on the third day''. ''Go, he has preceded you to Galilee. There you will meet him''. Spider: Are you Christian? Daniel: I'm an atheist.
