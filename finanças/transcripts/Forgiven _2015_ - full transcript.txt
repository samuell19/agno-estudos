No, no. What is it, I mean... - Colossians 3:13, Paul the Apostle says, "Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances "you may have against one another." And listen to this. "Forgive as the Lord has forgiven you." Because no matter what someone has done to us, no matter how bad it's been, we gotta learn how to do what Jesus did. And that's to forgive unconditionally. See that's one of the main building blocks of the foundation of becoming a stronger, more obedient Christian, amen. Amen. - Well what do you say we praise the Lord with some music, huh? ♪ Amazing grace ♪ ♪ How sweet the sound ♪ ♪ That saved a wretch like me ♪ ♪ I once was lost ♪ ♪ But now I'm found ♪ ♪ Was blind but now I see ♪ Where have you been?

Additional caller reports that a tan SUV, one male occupant, last seen leaving the location at a high rate of spee. No further. - It's probably just some yo-yo shooting at the moon. No sense of wasting a good cup of Joe on tha. - 2 Adam 41, we have that vehicle northbound on Route 27, Show is in pursuit. It looks like he's reaching for something. - When we get this guy stopped, watch your back. - So girls, did you get anybody to sign up to help with the picni? Oh yeah, just all the usual folks. 2 Adam 41, the suspect is eastboud on Elm Court. Copy 2 Adam 41. - Don't, don't tell me. Mrs. Parker offered to bring her horrible, horrible cornbread again. Dad. - 2 Adam 41, the suspect is now southbound on Ivy Street. Roger, 2A41, southbound Ivy. - You remember last year when we used it to scrub all the pots and pans. Now that's so bad. - This guy's gonna bail, get ready. - How do you know? He's slowing down. 2 Adam 41 is in foot pursuit of the male occupant through the parking lot of the Ivy School Church. Two horrible notes. - Now young lady, that would. Can I help you with something, young man? - Hold on, hold on, hold on. We can just run in with possible civilians in there. This just became a barricaded suspect situation. Go around back and watch the rear. I'll get with dispatch and get more units her. - What's going on, son? Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Get back or I'll shoot you. - Just tell me what's going on, son. - I said get back. - Daddy, okay listen to him. - Okay, okay. - 2 Adam 41 to dispatc. Our armed suspect is now barricaded inside the church with possible civilian. What's the ETA on additional units? 2A41, additional units are less than five. - Sit down. I said sit down. - Okay, okay, go ahead girls. Partner, Im set up here in the bac. - Copy that, get ready. This could go sideways any second. If it does, we're going in. - 10-4, I'm ready. - That's right, they're coming for you. - Just be quiet. I just need a minute to think. - If we do go in and the shooting starts, watch your crossfire. - Saying why don't you go out the backdoor, you still can get away. - Get away? Those aren't firetrucks pulling up out there, lady. - No, no, you still have time. We'll tell the police that you never even were in here. - It'll be like none of this never happened. - Like none of it never happened. Just be quiet. - Whatever you did, it can't be that bad. - Please be quiet. - Maybe we can help yo. - Or you can shut up. That's what you can do, all right? Hey Lieutenant, they called you out on this one, huh? - Yeah, I gotta stop answering my phone at night. What do you got, Mike? - Well my partner and I got a call of shots fired at a house on the west side of town. We thought it was just some guy shooting at the boogeyman, but then we get an update that he's fleeing the location in a tan SUV. - All right, let's check i. - The guy blows a stop sign right in front of us. We chase him here, he bails into the church, grabs three people, we set up a perimeter, and here we are. - You sure there's only three hostages? And do we know who they are? - Yeah, we talked to one of the church folks who helped set up after the service. He said that the only ones left inside were the pastor and his two daughters. - Oh, it's Pastor Taylor. I know him, he's a good man. So, who does this beauty belong to? - It comes back to a James Davies, who conveniently resids at the same house our shots fired took place. - Yeah, well that is conve. Maybe we should get a unit over there to make sure no one got shot. - I already got one, just waiting for an update. - All right, good work. - We've got a command post set up in a room on the far side of the church. - You got all escape routes blocked off? - All the points of egress are locked down. He's not getting out of that sanctuary. - All right, show me where we're set up. - What's your name? - Does it matter? - It does. - It's Kurt. - Hi Kurt, this is my father. He's the pastor of the church. His name's Russel Taylor. - Young man. - And this here's my younger sister, her name's Naomi. And I'm Elizabeth. - That's great. We can all be buddies. You can show me where we have our guys positioned on the perimeter. - Okay. We've got two guys coming in right here. Then these two will flank. What we'll do is we wil push towards the north. - You, come here. - No, no, no, whoa, whoa, what do you want with my daughter? - Settle down, old man. I just need her to go to the door and peek outside. Tell me what the police are doing. - No, no way. I'll go. - No, I said her. - It's okay, it's okay. I'll be fine. I'll be fine. Naomi. - I need you to look through that door and tell me what the police are doing. And if you run I'll shoot your family. You understand? - Yes. - Go. - They're just sitting out there. How many? - Lieutenant, I've got a female at the door. - Do you have any eyes on the suspect? - Negative, just the one f. - Copy that, keep watching for our bad guy. Roger that, Lieutenant. - It looks like a lot, but it's really dark so it's hard to tell. - Do you have any contact information for our suspect or the hos? - No cell for our bad guy, but we did get a cell number for one of our victims. A Elizabeth Roberts. Dispatch is trying to reach her now through 911. They'll link us to her once they make contact. - What's that noise? - It's my phone going off. - Well shut it off. Does anyone else have a phone on 'em? - No. - No. - It's probably just Bob cg to see if we locked up the church. - Who is it, who's calling? - It's 911. - 911? - Yes. It says 911. Probably the police. - You think? - Should I answer it? - Hold on a second, I'm thinking. - Come on man, it's not like they don't know we're in here, really? - Dad. - All right, just don't give them any information on me. - Hello? Yeah, this is Elizabet. Yeah, we're in the church. No, I can't say. He instructed me not t. Okay, they wanna talk to you. - No way, they can talk to you, not me. - He says no, but he's letting me talk to you. - Don't give them any information on me. Put that thing on speaker. - They're transferring us to the lieutenant. 10-4. - We have one of our victims, Elizabeth Roberts, on the line. The suspect refused to talk. - Elizabeth are you there? This is Lieutenant Morgan with the police department, can you hear me? - Yes, yes we can, you're on speaker phon. - Does that include James Davies? - No, he said his name was. - Morgan] No, we beliee it's James Davies who's in there with yo. We have his SUV out here in the parking lo. - Yes, Mr. Davies is here. - I said no information on me, now hang that thing up. No, don't hang up. - Hang up the phone! - No, no, no, no, don't ha. Lost her. - Now what are you gonna do? - I'm gonna text her my direct line, so she can call me right back. See what happens. - Well looks like our new police friend sent us his contact info. - So why did you give us a fake name? - I'm holding you hostage at gunpoint. You think I'm gonna really give you my real name? - So what now? What happens from here? - We wait. - Wait for what? Wait for them to forget about you? - If only. We wait until I can figure out a way out of here. And how's that gonna happen? - But what then? What happens once you get out of here? - Then I'm gone, not your problem anymore, right? - You think they're just gonna let you go? - They're not gonna wait out there forever. I'm not worth it. - Do you really believe that? You think the police'll just pack up and go home? - I'm sure they got families they can go home to. - How 'bout you, son? You have any family to go home to? - Not anymore. Might as well get comfortable. We're gonna be here a while. - Okay Lieutenant, the tactical team is ready to go. Our plan is to kick the back door, flash bang the place, and subdue Mr. Davies. - Okay Rose, just keep your guys ready. Okay, we're really not at that point right no. All right? - Roger that. - He gets a little excited. All right, do we have any more guys with Payor? - Looks like the police want to get us some dinner. Tell 'em I said okay. And that I want an unarmed officer drop the food off insie the door, then leave. And then if I see any other police officers, I'm gonna shoot the old man. And also, we're gonna be sending the sister to get it. - Come on. - So no funny stuff. - Let me just get the food. - No, no. You're gonna stay here with me and Daddy. Call him. - Morgan. - Yes, this is Elizabeth. - Hey Rose, we got her back. - Elizabeth, how you guys? - He said it's okay to bring the food to the front door. But he wants an unarmed officer to leave it inside, okay? - Is that it? - No. He says that if you try anything, he'll shoot my father. - Elizabeth, Elizabeth you there? Get me something to eat, huh? Anything? - Looks like they won't try anything. What's wrong with him? - I don't know, it just st. - Sit down. - He has a bad heart. - I said sit down. - He's having a heart attack. Dad, oh Dad. - Please, we have to do something. - Dad, it's a, no. Please give me my phon. Please, we have to do some. Please give me my phon. - Don't come any close. - Either shoot me or give me my phone. - Oh no! - All right, no funny stuff. They can come get your dad and that's it. No cops. - Please give me my phone, please. It's a big problem. - Morgan here. - Hello, this is Elizabeth. We think my father's having a heart attack. - All right Elizabeth, don't go away, don't go away. Mike, get in here right now. Elizabeth, you sure hes having a heart attack? - Yes please, you've gotta help him. - Okay just calm down. Now, is James gonna releas? Yes, he will release him but no cops. - We can't do that. - Why not, he says it's okay. - We can't let paramedics go into an armed situation. James could take them hostage as well. - They're not gonna send the paramedics in because they think you're gonna take 'em hostage. Please. - Just tell 'em I won'. He said he will not. - My partner and I will go in unarmed. - Elizabeth, hold on for one minute. - Okay. - You sure? You know I can't force you to go in exposed like that. - Lieutenant, we know the risk. But we gotta get that old man out. - Lieutenant Morgan? - What's going on? - They're up to something, hang up the phone. - Plus it'll give us a chance to look around and scope the place ou. If we gotta go in later, that intel will be helpful. - Okay, just keep your body armor on. Get your partner ready and grab a gurney from Fire. - No please, my dad needs-- - Hang up the phone! - Elizabeth you still there? - Yes, yes, yes we're here. All right put me on speaker, I want to talk to James. - Okay. Okay, go ahead. - James, this is what's gonna happen. I'm sending in two unarmed officers with a stretcher. They're gonna get Pastor Taylor and they're gonna bring hi. Do you hear me, James? - Yes, he can hear you. - Okay James, my goal here tonight is to make sure that we have a peaceful resolution to this. I'ma tell you right no, you try to harm my officers in any way, my tactical team will e in there in two seconds and they will end this. - He understands. - My guys will be there soon. Keep your dad comfortable. - Sit. All right, now I know what they're doing. Here's what's gonna happen in here. You, come here. Hey, if y'all want me to let them come in here and take him, then come here. All right, I need you to go to the door and come back and tell me everything the cops are doing. If you try anything I'm gonna shoot your famil, do you understand? - Yes. - Go. Come here. - No, please. Please, my dad needs m. - Y'all aren't listening. If y'all want me to let him go, then come here! Lay down. Let me go! - Stop fighting, you're goe my little insurance policy? I'm not gonna hurt you, all right? - There's two police officers coming towards the door with a stretcher. - Any guns? - I can't see any. - Sit down. - Yeah, that should do it, right. Call HQ, give 'em an update. - Okay, copy that, sir. - Answer, put it on speaker. Tell 'em the situation, and if they try anythig I will shoot you. - Hello? - Elizabeth, it's Lieutenant Morgan. My guys are at the doo. Now they're gonna knock when I tell 'em to, but I want you to stay on the line and tell me when it's safe for them to go in. - Okay, he says that they can come in. Also. - What is it? - He has a gun pointed right at me. And he's going to shoot me if they try anythin. - Can he hear me? - Yes, yes he can. - All right James, I want you to listen to me very carefully. No one needs to get hurt here. No one else needs to get shot this evening. My guys are not gonna try anything. They are there just to get the pastor. - Send 'em in. - You can send them in. - Thank you. Rose, you there? - Go 'head, Lieutenant. - All right, it's a go. Suspect has a female hostage at gunpoint, so I want you to get in and get out. Our priorities tonight is to get the pastor to medical and not escalate the situation. - Copy that. - It's never easy. - Come in. - How's it going in here? - Tell him to shut up. - He wants you to be quiet. - How long has be been like this? - I said for him to shut up. - He's only been like this for a few minutes. - Listen pal, we came in here unarmed as you directed. All right, we're doing what you want. But the doctors are gonna need this information to treat this man. Now, does he has a history of heart problems? - Yes, he takes heart medicine. I don't know what kind of though, but it's on file at the drug store. - Okay, that's important to know. - That's enough, tell him. - He says that he wants you to leave. - How 'bout you let us take one of the daughters out? This could be this man's last night, and one of them should be with him. - No way. - Please, please, I'll stay with you. All right. - Come on, it's the right thing to do. It's their father. - Please., you still have me. They're not gonna come in here if you still have me. - All right, but only she can go. - Come on, ma'am, come on. - I can't go without you, I can't. - Go, Daddy needs you. I'm gonna be fine. - Come on, lady. Please don't hurt my sister. - How would you describe the suspect? - You know, I know you won't believe this, but I don't think he wants to hurt anybody. I think he's just more scared and confused if anything. - I got the same impression when I was inside, boss. I'm sorry Lieutenant, but we got the passenger stabilized and we have to head to the ER. Yeah. - Thank you for saving my father and I. - No, it's all right, it's all right. - Look, I'm gonna send an officer to the hospital to get another statement, okay. - Thank you. Wait, what did James do, did he hurt someon? - No he, actually we were just chasing him for some traffic warrants. - Thank you. - Traffic warrants. - After what she's been th, I'm not about to tell her that her sister's being held hostage by a guy who just shot his girlfriend tonight. Let's go. - What? - Nothing. Why are you doing this? - What, hiding in here from the cops? Carrying a gun, keeping you here, what? - All of the above. - It's a long story. You shouldn't concern yourself with it. Well it doesn't really look lie we're going anywhere anytime soon. And I'm sorry, but when you came in here and you stuck that gun in my face, you made it my concern. - Like I said, you shouldn't worry yourself with it. Just sit there and be quiet. - I also want to say thank you. - For what? For letting them take y father and sister out. - I hope your dad's okay. - Thanks. - Time to try and make contact again. - What's the plan? - I'ma see if they're still hungry. - Looks like they're getting impatient out there. Nah, just getting us some food. They're offering us dinner again. - Yeah, I'm pretty thirsty. - Well looks like they're still hungry. Did you guys get that pizza and sodas? - Yeah, two pizzas and a six pack of pop. - Excellent. - Hey, what's going on? - Nothing, just ordering us some food. - Huh. - What does it say? - I asked if he could see what she was textig and the reply was no. - Well that's great. There's a bathroom, tell her to get to the window. We can pull her out and do an extraction from there. And end this thing. - Hmm. - Did you tell her? - I told her that the food is on its way. Look, there's no way our bad guy is letting her text without him watching. - I see, that's why you get paid the big bucks, Lieutenant. Yeah right. I do like your bathroom idea. Get your guys ready, I'll see if I can get her in there. - Will do. - Oh and Mike. - Yeah, Lieutenant? - Have one of your guys stop by the store and pick up some female items. - Female items? - Yeah female items. You know, freshen up stuff. Just do it, I'll explain later. - Copy that. - What's wrong? - It's on its way. I'm sorry, but I'm gonna need you to stand next to me again. - You can come in. You can sit the food right. And then he says you can step out. - Help yourself. What's this? - How am I supposed to know? Maybe condiments, salt, pepper, napkins. - I think it's for you. I probably should have had you test this firs. In case they drugged it or something. To be honest with you, I was just really hungry. I bet you never thought you'd be sitting in a room with a lunatic like me tonight. - No. No, I don't think you're a lunatic. I think you're just some guy that got himself into trouble and took a wrong turn some. - A wrong turn? That's one way of putting it. Except my wrong turn started when I was bor. I've been on the wrong path every since. - Did you have a rough childhood? - You could say that. My dad got locked up when I was five. My mom died when I was 12. I was pretty much raised by the streets. - Have you ever gone to church? - You know to be quite honest, this is the first time I've ever step foot inside a church. It's quite fitting if you ask me. - Fitting? What do you mean by it's fitting that you're in a church? - You know who's out there? I'm surrounded by cops. I'm holding you against your will. And how do you think this is gonna end? - How is it gonna end? - Well I'm not gonna give up. And I know they're not going anywhere. I've got one gun and they have 20, do the math. - So that's it? You came in here and did this to my family and me, just so that you can be killed and end it all? Well why wait for the cops to come and do it. You've got a gun, why don't you do it yoursef so I can go home and be with my family? - It's not an option for me. - What's the differenc? - 'Cause my mom killed herself. She committed suicide. She ended her life and left me all alone. - I'm so sorry. - Nobody in this world cares whether I live or die. What's it matter? - For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. - What's that? - It's a "Bible" verse. It's Romans 3:23. - What's it mean? - It means that we're all sinners. - Some bigger than others. - Sinning is sinning. God doesn't rank it. And he forgives each and every one of us the same, we just simply have to ask. - And how do you know that? - Because he told me s. - You talk to God? - Yeah, I do. I talk to him every da. - And he talks back? Just like some voice from the sky? - No, he actually talks to me through this. - A talking book. - Yeah, in a way I guess the "Bible" is a talking book. James, these are his words. This is his message to us and it's, it's a message of peace, love, and forgiveness. - Yeah, that may work for some people. But there's really a heaven and a hell, I know where I'm heade. - No, you don't need to-- - I've had enough talking. - I really need to go to the ladies' room. - No not now, it can wait. - I've been waiting hours. I really need to go to the ladies' room. - Where is it? - It's right down the hall, I can be quick. Come on. - Okay. But I have to go in there with you. - That's fine. - You can use that one. - You think you could just turn around, maybe face the other way? - I don't want you to try anything. - What am I gonna do, escape? Trust me there's only one way out and I'm not gonna fit. - Just hurry up. What's taking so long. - You know it's a little uncomfortable with you listening. Do you think you could turn the water on, make some sound? - Fine, whatever speeds things up. - It's from the phone we planted. - What's it say? She's in the restroom. - My team's ready, bos. - Let's go. - Uh-uh, wait, wait, wait. He's in there with her. You know who's out there? I'm surrounded by cops and holding you against your will, and how do you think this is going to end? I'm surrounded by cops, holding you against your will. Gonna end, gonna end, gonn. How is it gonna end? - What's going on? - Nothing. - Open the door. - I'm almost done, I'll be right out. - Open the door! What are you doing? - Nothing, I was just using the restroom. - Let's go. - What's going on, Lieutenant? My team's ready to go. - She thinks she can talk him out. Our hostage. - Mm-hmm. - Look LT, he's down to one hostage. We've already been in twice and I think we can kick that door and take him before he can get a shot off. It's time to end this thing. - Look, if there's a chance for a peaceful resolution, we need to work toward it. - Come on Lieutenant, these things never end peaceful. You know it's only a matter of time until he decides to off himself and probably takes her wit. - So you think you can get to our guy before he gets a shot off? - Absolutely. The front doors aren't even locked. - Well what if he gets that shot off, one lone shot. - I mean Lieutenant, that's what body armor's for. - Yeah, well it's too bad our hostage isn't wearing any. It's the hospital. Morgan here. - So you really believe that stuff in the "Bible"? - Yep, I do. It saved me. - Saved you, from what? What's a girl like you need saving from? You're a preacher's daughter. - Remember how I was saying before, we all sin, it's part of our natur? Well, we have to take responsibility for our sins and understand that there's a consequence for sinning and all that. And what that consequence, it means eternal punishment. So in other words, going tl and spending eternity with Satan. In Romans 6:23, it says, "For the wages of sin is death. "But the gift of God is eternal life." See, to be saved, it means that we're spared from that eternal punishment and rescued by the Lord, if you will. - So how does that wor? How does someone get saved? - It starts with forgiveness. You have to ask the Lod to forgive your sins. - Is that it? - Well that's part of it. Simply asking for forgiveness, that's not what saves anyone. It's really believing that Jesus Christ was the true son of God who paid for your sins by dying on the cross and that he rose again. John 3:16, it says, "For God so loved the world "that he gave his only begotten son, "that whoever believeth in him shall not perish "but have everlasting life." - That's a lot to ask for. - Is it? I mean is it a lot to ask for? When in return someone is granted eternal lif. - Right okay, got it, thanks for the update. Our shooting victim is out of surgery, it looks like she's gonna make it. - Well great, lets update our bad guy. Let him know the lil woman is gonna pull through. Maybe he'll end this thing now that he's not facing a murder rap. Hmm. What is it, boss? - Pastor Taylor, he coded on the way to the hospital, they couldn't bring him back. Looks like our guy's gonna face murder charges after all. - Now everyone knows that Jesus died on the cross, what most people don't know is that he wasn't the only one who was crucified that day. There were these two convicted thieves, one on each side of Jesus that were hung that morning. And here, can I get a "Bible" for you? Okay. Turn to Luke 23, it's page 898. Got it? One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him. "Aren't you the Messia? "Save yourself and us." You see that man, he doubted that Jesus was the Lord because in his mind he believed that if he was the true son of God, he surely would save himself from that horrible death, okay. So now continuing in verse 40. But the other criminal rebuked him. "Don't you fear God," he said. "Since you're under the same sentence, "we are punished justly for we are getting "what are deeds deserved, but this man has done nothing." See, that thief, he believed that Jesus was the true son of Go. And then it continues. In 42, then he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom." See right there, that condemned man dying on a cross, he asked for forgiveness. Continuing in 43, Jesus answered him. "Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise." You see James, no one has ever been saved any differently than that dying thief who simply believed and asked for forgiveness and asked to be saved. Can I ask you somethin? - You wanna know what I did. - Yeah, they said that you shot someone. - I did. I shot my girlfriend. I didn't mean to. We were arguing, she went for the gun, I tried to take it from her and it just went off. - Oh wow. Well why didn't you tell the police that? - The police? They don't believe somebody like me. They take somebody like me and lock me up and throw away the key. - Well did you take her to the hospital or call an ambulance? - No, I panicked so I ran. And the cops started chasing me so I panicked more and ended up here. - Well maybe she's all right. I mean maybe she's not as bad as you think she is. - Not that bad? I shot her in the ches. I watched the blood pour out of her. Trust me, it's bad. - Don't you wanna know for? Don't you wanna know for sure what happened to her? I know I would. I'd wanna know what happened to someone I really care about, if they're alive or dead. Like, I'd really like to know how my father's doing. - Call him. Just to check on him. - What about your girlfriend? - Don't worry yourself with that. What do you got, Mike? - Sir, I got two guys n the east corridor here and then I've got two more at the entrance. - It's our hostage. Morgan here. - Yeah hi, this is Elizabeth. - Can he hear me? - No. - No, no to what? - No, they were just wondering if you were letting me go and I told 'em no.

But you need to do something first. You have to give me the gun. Come on, it'll be okay. It's gonna be okay. All right, let's get him. - No, no, no, no, no hold on, give it a minute. - Listen, you can do this. You can turn your life around. I believe in you, I believe in you.

Yeah. - That was a pretty brave thing you did here today. Thank yo. - Yeah, I don't think too many people would have helped him out the way you did. - I guess I just saw something in him. You know when he came in here and he held me hostage, I don't know I just never felt like he was gonna hurt me. It's like I saw something in his eyes. - Well, his girlfriend got out of surgery. The officers, well asked her what happened at the shooting. - Yeah, what did she say? - She said that you'rea good judge of characte. She was also the one that got the gun. He was just trying to get it away from her and it went off. Come on, I'll give you a ride to the hospital. Your sister's been waiting for you for a long time. - So what it says in te "Bible" to Romans 6:23. "For the wages of sin is death. "But the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ." Come here, down here. "Eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." Let us now turn to 2 Corinthians 5:17. "Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. "Old things are passed away. "Behold, all things become" You see everyone, when you're saved, you are as the saying goes, born again. You're considered a new creation, a new person. But most importantly, a new ray of light.
