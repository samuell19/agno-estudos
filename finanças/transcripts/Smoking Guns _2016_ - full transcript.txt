[man sobbing] [sobbing continues] Jack... Jack... [Jack] Gambling's got nothing to do with making money. It's about winning and losing. [hard rock music] [Jack] Dear God, I come to you in my hour of need, not as a Christian, Muslim, Jew or Hindu, just me, Jack Cameron. I ain't given up yet, even though you've ignored me for years. I now realize for you to truly hear me, I have to fear nothing and risk more than my job seekers allowance. What you betting on, horses? Yeah, Carlton fancies the favorite, two-to-one. Two-to-one, that's a rich man's prize isn't it? [Jack] Today, I truly put my faith in you. I'll risk the fall so I can know how it feels to fly. The bet of my life. Don't chase the big wins like the rest of the loser's in here. Stay sharp, bet smart. Fuck it, you're right. [Jack] I have the right to risk my own life if it means I have a chance of saving it. [guys speaking indistinct] I'm chasing more than a castrated bet like a two-to-one favorite. I need more than a stay of execution. I have to have the strength to go all the way if I want to cut the shackles of contentment and take the walk to glory and success. Today, I'm finally ready to battle through my fear in a place I feel closest to you, my place of worship. Where I'm surrounded by my fellow brothers of faith. Punters whose cries for help are heard as often as the sound of a silver ball spinning on the roulette machines. The bookies, where I've gone from a scared 16-year-old boy, frightened of putting a pound on a ten-team accumulator, To putting my life on the line for the bet that would change my life and make it worth living. If this wins, everything I've ever done in my life up until this point has become a stepping stone in the journey of achievement. Another loss, and everything I've ever done has been worthless, meaningless, and I will disappear from the book of life. Another loser from around the way... [chuckles] You trying to close us down again love? [Jack] ...who won't be missed. Good luck. [announcer] And Rocket Fuel, the favorite, has made a terrible start, he's already lost by one and Paradise Lost has absolutely flown from the gate. He's bolting clear! Fucking come on Rocket Fuel. Fucking actual fucking bollocks, Yiannis. Fucking listening to you, that is. It was just a freak race. If they ran that race 100 times over our horse would have won 99 times. We were just unlucky. No one predicted the winner of that race, no one. [man] Jack. Jack. [Jack] You gotta be strong to survive hell, and even stronger if you wanna get out. There's no room for weakness on the road to success. Go on, fuck off, fucking muck. - You fucking shit your pants. - No, I fucking never. - Fucking did. - Didn't. You did pants it a bit, mate. I didn't fucking pants it though. Why didn't you Wung Fu him? Fuck off, Yiannis, I'll fucking Wung Fu you, brother. What would your fucking old man would have done if it happened to him, man? He'd have fucking kicked the shit out of him. - Exactly. - I know, alright. I fucking know, just leave it. You need to fucking man up, man, seriously. Fuck off, I've had enough of you boys. Leave him... [muttering] What do you want? What? I'm at a friend's house, Mom. I'm not at the fucking bookies, I told you I'm at a friend's house. Mom, I've told you a thousand times I don't want to go to work with me dad, do I? I don't wanna work in a stinky fucking fish and chip shop, do I? Fuck that. Okay, so I won't ask you for a penny from now on then, aye? Alright then, I tell you what then you can stuff your fucking money you selfish bitch. [Jack] Ian's at that strange age when you're suddenly expected to grow up and become the man your father is. But Ian ain't ready to grow up just yet. Jack, Jack, where did your horse come? Fuck knows. Well, you gonna fucking check it? Or give me the name and I'll check it for you. Yeah. What you, you won? He didn't win a penny. Was it, Jack, was that your horse, Paradise Lost nine-to-one? [Jack] Yeah. [Ian] One down two to go, boys. Jack, you're gonna sort me out if it comes off wouldn't you? Course I will. How much you gonna give me if it comes off? I dunno 20 grand? But I'd force you to enroll in some kind of college course or something. I wouldn't just give you the cash 'cause I know what you'd do with it. Yeah, man, I'd sort you out. Guess who, bitches? [upbeat music] Yes, Paul, what's happening, mate? Last Friday of the month already, pal? [speaking indistinct] your face. Who done that to you? Well, someone needs to get fucked up don't they? I'm up for a fight. I mean, I haven't had a fight for 17 years but for you, Jack, I'd come out of retirement. That wasn't you, you little shit, was it? How you doing, brother? - Alright, yeah. - Yeah, good. I had a crash this morning didn't I, just outside. Yeah, if he didn't hit the lamp post, he would have driven straight through the window - and probably killed us all. - Oh, don't tell me. You was rushing to put on a bet weren't you? Hey, hey, what was it a hot tip, was it? Yeah, yeah, something like that, Paul, yeah. You maniac. Hey, mate, heard about your cousin Chris, yeah. Very sorry to hear that he was a lovely bloke, he was a top man, and I know you two was close. Yeah, yeah, we weren't that close at the time, but, yeah, we were close as kids, you know what I mean. Oh, sure, sure, it couldn't have been that much of a shock really was it? What with him being so fat and everything. [laughing] You can't say that shit, man. Well, hopefully you'll last a bit longer than you did last month, Paul. You were in and out of here within an hour. [chuckles] Yeah, well, none of us can buy back our past can we Yiannis, hey? Good to see you. How's the life of contentment been treating you? Phyllis, can you make me a lovely steaming hot cup of coffee please, love, yeah? Likely need lots of caffeine. And stick some sugars in it, five sugars, yeah. We ain't got any sugar. Got some of this sweetener, tastes just like sugar. Do you want a few drops of that? Are you on fucking crack or something? Sugar substitute got aspartame in it and anyone who knows anything, knows aspartame gives you brain tumors. I mean, it ain't bad enough they wanna take all our money but her, this one, she's trying to fry my fucking brain, as well. Oh, sod off, it ain't that bad. And, anyway, I don't want any distractions around me, alright? I'm on a diet. Oh, I didn't realize you was on a diet, oh, you're on a diet sorry about that. Well, I'm not you fat cunt, so put some sugar in me coffee. Alright, lads, so I tell you what I'm buzzing you, Yiannis. I'm a bit buzzing 'cause I had a very good month. I don't like to boast but I'm gonna, right. I've sold five houses, four flats, a bungalow to some sweet little gray haired old lady. She's looking for the downstairs, she's looking for the upstairs, there ain't one it's a fucking bungalow. I've got 1,500 pound in my pocket, which I'm telling you, right now, I'm gonna stick a couple of zero's on the end of that by closing time tonight 'cause me, I'm ready to fucking gamble. Let's get ready to gamble! Yes! So, who else has done what? Come on, who's done their balls, who's made a bit of money? Well, Jack, took a bit out of the roulette and stuck it on a treble didn't he? You stuck it on a treble? Yeah, but listen, if all three horses come in... - Yeah? - ...half a million quid over it. His first horse just fucking come in... Your first horse has... So what that's why you wanna stick it on a single then isn't it? Because horse trebles never come in. You never know, Paul. Mate, it ain't ever coming in, you know that. Come on, who else has done what? What have you done? [Jack] I could never have a job. Never work for a wage and have a boss. It's the breeding ground of contempt, and the steady process of ending dreams and settling for a life of watching the pennies. Marrying the first girl you meet, getting fat, having kids, watching your wife get fat, raising your kids 'til they get a job and meet a girl, get married, get fat and have more kids. It's the wage slave circle of life. ♪ In constant sorrow all through his days ♪ ♪ I am a man of constant sorrow ♪ ♪ I've seen trouble all my days ♪ Yeah, alright? Yeah, I've dug the foundation. Yeah, it was two hours, like I said. Well, how far away are you? I need my wages ASAP. Don't suppose you could give me a lift up the high street? I'm running really late. I'm sorry mate, it's a two seater. ♪ I am a man of constant sorrow ♪ ♪ I've seen trouble all my days ♪ [people chattering] ♪ I bid farewell to old Kentucky ♪ ♪ The place where I was born and raised ♪ ♪ The place where he was born and raised ♪ ♪ In constant sorrow ♪ [announcer] And they're racing. And Heart Attack is off to a good start and God Loves A Grafter has failed to come out of the stalls, he's refused to race. The chief threat to the favorite is not taking part, and Heart Attack now has an uncontested lead, with May's Boy Macy in second... [Jack] Chris's death hurt me. Not because we were close, I couldn't stand the fat wanker. It's just fucked up how insignificant a loser's life can be. [upbeat music] Excuse me, sir, I've a laptop out the back. Would you be interested in buying it off me? I'm losing my money my brother, leave me alone, man. Excuse me, sir, brother I tell you I've a brand new laptop out the back and I'm selling it cheap, would you be interested in it? Bugger off. Excuse me, I've a laptop out the back if you'd be interested in buying it off me. - Are you sure now? - I'm more than sure. Brand new, top of the range, you know... Sorry, man, I don't want one of them. Any youse gentlemen interested in buying a laptop? Brand new, laptop bag for it, the whole lot. No thanks, mate. For how much? 3.5 G hertz processor, 16 gigabyte ram, one terabyte solid state drive, that's 3,000 pounds in any of the high streets you go to. Now she's top of the range quad core. Give me 150 pound for it and it's yours. So it works properly an all that, does it? Of course it works, she's brand new, look, she's top of the range. I give you 50 quid, yeah? Let's meet in the middle shall we? 100 pound and I can't go a penny less. [Ian] Okay, mate, 100 quid, and it better not fucking break... - What the fuck you think you're doing? - Come here to me, fella... 100 pound's not enough, 250 at the very least. Jesus, Mary and fucking Joseph, pal, it's a brand new laptop. Hang on a second, mate. Your mate just said 100 quid for it, right? A deal's a deal at the end of the day, mate. So, I mean, you can't go back on the deal now, bruv. 100 pound or nothing. Mick, I'm out there telling the man 100 pound. A deal is a deal, you should have said something earlier on. We're dealing with savvy negotiators here. I can see that, man. Go on, you got yourself a deal, 100 pound. Sweet as a nut, brother. Look you're leaving me with a fucking fiver. God bless you, God bless you. I tell you what, sorry about my friend, Mick. But you got yourself a good old deal there, 100 pound. Credit to you, credit to you. Anyway look I better be off before you hustle the shirt of me back. Cheers for that, mate. [speaking indistinct] [Ian] Cheers, mate. [Ian yelling indistinct] [laughing] Glad we're alone actually, Yian, man, I gotta ask you for something. I wish I could, mate, I'm skint. No, no, it's not money, mate, I make my own money. What do you want from me then? Well, look, I know you know a lot of people, some nicer than the others and I was wondering if you could introduce me to some of the others, if you know what I mean. Sorry, mate, you completely lost me... - I need to buy a gun. - What? Gun. [Jack] I want to feel the preciousness of life and death at the end of my index finger. Hold my fate in my hand. Yiannis knows everyone from round here, from the road sweepers to the people with a few quid. If anyone is going to have a link to a local arms dealer, it'd be him. Yiannis is a busy body who gambles out of boredom and escape from his life after his clothes factory went bankrupt in the recession. He spends his days hiding from his miserable wife who thinks he's out searching for work, when in reality, all he does is give Ian bad advice, bet like a feminine prostitute on her period and get on my nerves in the process. Try and learn something here. Don't be like the rest of the mugs in here. - Always check the form. - What at 12:40? You're too late, man, look they're nearly all in. Fuck. [Jack] Now as harmless and content as Yiannis may be, he loves nothing more than a bit of bullshit, a tall tale. He lives for that moment when he's got someone's attention, usually Ian's, and if he's not stopped, could waffle on for hours given the opportunity to take center stage. And if one lie is enough to question all truths, the thousands of lies he has told me over the years leaves me in no doubt that it's bullshit, even when some of it might be true. [Yiannis] I know someone, some Albanian geezer. Pipi, one word. I've heard he plays cards down the Shooters Club. Oh, Yian, don't start with all that bullshit. Bektash and all the drug mafioso's and all that. Do you want my help or you gonna carry on taking the piss? You might even know him. Little guy, big head? Always doing his football bets on Saturday morning? No 'cause I have a sleep in on Saturday morning don't I? Oh, yeah, lazy. Well, give me his number and I'll be grateful, Yiannis, I mean, I'll give you a nice drink. No, I don't want a drink. I just don't want any of this coming back to me okay? I'll tell you what Yian. It won't get back to you alright, I'll go on the meet and that I'll sort it all out, and I'll give you a nice drink anyway. But I won't have to mention your name, alright? I'll see what I can do. What do you mean you'll see what you can do? You've got the number on your phone ain't you? Just give me the number I'll sort it... [Ian yelling indistinct] Those fucking pikey, fucking cunts! It's your own fault, I did try and warn you. Here what, right. If I ever see that fucking gypo cunt again... Yeah? If you ever see those gypos again, you'll what? What do you mean what? I'll fucking kick his fucking head in, bro. [Yiannis] Yeah, right, son, he would have mullered you. I can fight, Yiannis, looks can be deceiving, bro. You can't fight you're too small. I might be fucking small, but I'm fucking quick, bruv, do you know what I mean? - You can't fight. - Oi, don't forget I'm trained, bruv. I've been doing Wung CHUN since I was six years old, brother. Honestly, I have, me dad taught me, mate. Didn't know I was a fucking martial artist, did he? [laughing] You're brilliant, Ian. - What is funny, aye? - So you're old man's a Kung Fu master? - I had no idea. - Yeah, he's a fucking Sifu, bruv. Ain't that a little Japanese dog? No, it's a martial arts grand master, mate. No, I'm sure it's a little dog. I was gonna get one for Angelica only the missus had a shit fit. You're talking about a fucking Shih Tzu, you fucking idiot. Alright, show us a move. I don't wanna fucking hurt his brittle old bones, do I? Go on, show us a move. Bruce Lee managed to give demonstrations without hurting anybody so I'm sure you'll be alright, son of Shih Tzu. Alright then, fuck you. Let me just... Alright, throw a punch. - You sure? - Go on, fucking do it. Go on then, bruv, fucking throw a punch. What are you doing, you fucking, little Greek cunt? [laughing] You told me to. Yeah, but you could have fucking waited 'til I was ready, you fucking Greek prick. I'm fucking going in, before I fucking end up hurting you by accident, you cunt. [upbeat music] Look at, him he's flying, it's like he's got wings. He's a Pegasus, he's beautiful, look at him... Oh, come on. You should of just paid a single like I told you. But, no, as always you have to get too greedy for your own good. You gonna give me this... the number of this bloke, or what? You don't need to worry about making a couple of hundred quid from that. You think you're gonna make half a million quid. [chuckles] - Well, until then. - Come on! [announcer] My, oh my, oh my. Go on, call him, I'm curious to see what sort of world my daughter's really growing up in. So can I borrow the phone? What's wrong with your phone? I've got no credit, I'm on Pay As You Go. [laughs] A man making 250 quid bets should at least have a little bit of credit on his phone. Fucking idiot, go on, call him. 250 quid bet, 1,400-to-one shots, I've never seen anything like it in my life. It's a novelty bet at the most... [shushing] It's ringing. [upbeat music] [phone buzzing] Answer the fucking phone. I'm trying to concentrate here. Stay a bit longer, Bektash, please don't go. You have already paid my wife's new kitchen. Let me lose a little back to you. I'm starting to feel guilty. [laughing] - Answer the fucking phone! - Okay, man. Who's this? Where you get my number from? Yiannis, I don't know any Yiannis. Who the fuck is Yiannis? Oh, okay, okay, Greek Yiannis who owned the clothes factory. Tell him he's a... Why he not phone me, do introduction first? Okay, fuck it, business is business, I suppose. We are in recession, I'll take a risk on you. How much money do you wanna spend? 150 pound, so you wanna buy a replica version? Okay, no problem, you come talk to me, we sort something out. You know the Shooters Club? Shooters Club, yeah? I'm just about two minutes from there. Yeah, just in the bookies there, on the parade. How long should I be, mate? Oh, you're, you're coming here, yeah? - No, no, no. - Put your football bets on. [mouthing words] Not here, not here. Alright, mate. Yeah. I'm with Yiannis, so you'll, you'll... - No. - You'll recognize Yiannis. Alright, how long, mate? Alright, I see you in a minute, bruv, yeah? Bye. He's coming here? You shouldn't have told him to come here. What did I tell you? Don't shit where you eat. I told you. I'm fucking a shark. I should be on television, Bektash. Deal the fucking cards. Sorry, boys, I have to go, some business. [clears throat] Drugs? No, Bektash, I'm not a drug dealer. But if I was, or ever decide to do drugs, I'll come to you first out of respect. Hi, mate, any luck? Oh, look, 33. Put 33, mate. [Jack] Look at Ian, he can't help himself can he? Oh, shit. Do you know who that is? Who the bloke Ian's bothering? No, who is he? [Yiannis] You know when you told Ian that he's gonna fuck with the wrong bloke's game one of these days? Raise 2,000. I think I fold, too, this seems personal. Big boy bet from Big Bektash. He's on tilt, I call. I'm going, boys, good luck, yeah? Lucas, good to see you. [speaking in foreign language] Ozan, see you later. Oh, no, I told you. I told you, listen to me. Oh, my God, I know what I'm talking about, mate, honestly. It doesn't make a difference, let the man play his game. Yes, Yian, but I told him put 33. Look at the previous spins, man, fucking obvious. It's just a matter of luck though, really, isn't it? [Ozan] What do you want to do Bektash, raise? Yes, Ozan, I raise your flush with two pair Ace, and King kicker. 3,000. Call. [laughing hysterically] - [Yiannis] Don't you know who that is? - [lan] Who? [Yiannis] That's Holt, Richard fucking Holt. You never heard of him? Name rings a bell. He's a big time coke dealer. Cocaine? No fizzy drinks. - What do you mean... aye? - Yes, Ian, cocaine. He's supposed to be a right dangerous fucker. In and out of prison and you're telling him off for not listening to your stupid betting theories. [Ian] He don't look that hard. Billy the Mechanic told me a crazy story... Oh, a story by Billy the Bullshitter? Can't wait to hear this one. Bill's alright, what's your problem with Billy? Nothing, just can't believe a word that comes out of his mouth, that's all. Shut up a minute, Jack, I really want to hear this. [Jack] Why is it always you that hears all these colorful stories, Yian? Like, last week it was the story about fat Bektash that comes in here and bets on the Turkish football. Now don't fuck with Bektash and his crew. They ain't no joke, they're the real deal, mate. What we are going to do now with the unfortunate Ozan's money? Huh? It wouldn't be fair for you to take the pot just because you killed a gentleman. No... [chuckles] No. This is not the Wild West. The game, it's the game. And we have to protect the game's integrity at all cost. Ozan won this pot, fair and square. Make sure his family get the money. His son just passed his driving test. [laughing] This money can pay for his first car, huh. [Bektash laughing] Who's laughing now, huh? Come on, Phyllis, I've grown a beard by the time you're ready. I've only got one pair of hands, can't do two things at once, you know. That's 250 pound, please, love. Have you made that coffee for me yet? Um, yeah, I'll bring it over to you when it's ready, okay. Did you want sweetener in that or not? Yeah, go on then if that's all you got. [scoffs] So they pull up at the traffic lights, eyes still glued to the rear view mirror and pondering their next move waiting for Dexter to give them an order when out of nowhere... Bang-bang, bang-bang. Holt and his associate have made off in a Land Rover full of coke. That's a sick move. That has got to be the one of the biggest load of bullshit I've heard in my entire life. Him, fuck off. Sounds like the plot of a shit film. Oh, shit, I think he heard us. [Ian] Shit, what should we do? [Jack] You lot are such pussies, man. Ian, your old man would be ashamed of you. What's he gonna do, kill us here, in the bookies, in broad daylight? No, there are too many witnesses here for that. Look, just get ready to run if we have to. Fuck that, I ain't running from him. I ain't scared of him. [Ian] I'm only joking, anyway. Fucking... - You're scared of him. - No, I'm not. [Jack] You are, you're scared of a bloke in a fucking pink shirt, just admit it. I ain't scared of him, I told you. If he asked you to give him a blowjob, you probably would out of fear, wouldn't you? Yeah, I would, and I'd bite his fucking cock off and all. So you're agreed, yeah, you'd put his cock in your mouth? - No. - [Jack] What about up your bum? - No. - Would you let him take your anal virginity, as well? Shut up, Jack, he's fucking coming over. Let me do the talking. What's that, Ian, you're already an anal veteran? - Yeah? - Just shut up. I'm sorry. I'm sorry if I came across as... stubborn and uncooperative towards you, son. You were clearly right and I should have listened to you. Unfortunately, it's a defensive mechanism that I've developed over the years due to too much interaction with the lowlifes and scoundrels of this world. Mate, that's... No, sir, it's no worries, honestly, I was just trying to help you out. Clearly seem to know what you're doing, and when it comes to anything computerized I'm a bit of a technophobe, unfortunately. Do you know Zack Anderson? Tall bloke, well dressed, 30 odd. You don't mean Zack the barber who's got a little barber shop on Church Street, do you? No, but I know who you mean, nice bloke, lovely skin. Yeah, Zack's a diamond he is, yeah. No, this Zack Anderson's a police officer, a marksman, actually. - What, killing criminals? - Well, yeah. I see, what a job that would be, man. I'd love to do a job like that... Part of a fucking SWAT team or something. - Do you know what I mean? - [Jack] What you? Fuck off, you ain't got the bollocks to shoot someone in between the eyes. No, I could. Just 'cause you ain't got the balls to kill someone don't mean I ain't. I would, I'd kill someone, but it'd have to be for a reason. Well, everyone can kill for a reason, can't they? But would you kill for 35K a year, six days a week? - But what does that work out to be a week though? - Fuck knows? About two grand a month after tax and national insurance. Well, what's that 500 a week? Fuck that, I could earn that in a good afternoon in here. No, if they wanted me to kill criminals they'd have to give me at least double that. Zack's a very good friend of mine. He recently won 5,000 pounds, machines like this. In fact, yeah... he won it in this very bookies, a few weeks back. So, I'm in bed, right, I get up one morning and I think, Richard, get with the times, man. So here I am, delving into the computerized world of gambling, without a fucking clue what I'm doing, mind you. [all laughing] But, fortunately, I have young Ian here to help me, haven't I, Ian? I've seen people lose everything to these digital demons. Do you know Tony Costa? He had a little pita bread factory on the industrial estate just off the Gold Road. - Tall skinny bloke? - No, short and fat. He lost his business, his home and eventually his family. His family? His wife ran off with the next door neighbor, some Polish bloke, Viktor, with a K. What happened to your face? What are you a boxer or something? Nah, I had a car accident earlier on. Black '94 three series BMW wrapped around that lamppost? Shame, real shame, I had the same car mid '90s. Beautiful it was, sleek, smooth... Oh, and that smell of leather. I can still... [sniffs] still smell it now. Pre air bag, unfortunately, for your nose. You need to get that done. Kitten ran out in the middle of the road, and I swerved to avoid it. A kitten, that's the first I ever heard about a kitten. Yeah, I knew you lot would take the piss. [Richard] No, no, nothing to take the piss about there, you did the right thing, my friend. I always say swerve for a kitten never for a dog. Dogs are filthy things. I'd always swerve for a kitten. Anyway, gentleman, back to the racing post. [Jack] Everywhere I turn I see the devil. If I make the choice to be scared, I'll fear him. But fears a choice, so fuck you fear. [Yiannis] What's the story, Carlton? Good, Yiannis, what about you? Same shit, different smell. Listen, man, I never even know that I should save. Every penny I earned, I spent it. You know them say save for a rainy day? I never think about a rainy day, I think every day is sunshine. [upbeat music] - [Ian] What did you do? - Your mom, up the back passage, Bosch. He's gone to me, "What you do?" I've gone, "Your mom, up the back passage, Bosch." - [laughing] - [Jack] Brilliant! Oi, don't tell your old man I said that though. - It was just a joke, yeah. - Keep running it... So, like, it was a couple of years ago, I've sold his old man a flat down on what Ducant Road? - That's it. - Yeah, investment purposes. This geezer, I can't believe the size of him he's like six-four, 20 stone, like thick Glaswegian accent, big shiny bald head, the geezer actually goes to me, "I'm expecting ten grand off the asking price now, Paul." He takes the piss though, but wait if he comes down, here. He's one scary mother fucker and I'm like, "Yes, sir. No, sir. Three bags full, sir." Just don't crush me with your big hairy hands, will you? - Hey, what the fuck happened to you? - What? Well, I mean it's a bit late for a growth spurt, ain't it? I mean, you're like the size of your old man's big toe. Fuck off. [phone ringing] [speaking in foreign language] [Paul] Right, two, 75 pound bets, gentleman. I think that's what we wanna do. Come on, let's have some of that. All suggestions gratefully accepted. This right. 31, 32, 33, and 34. Put them on, put them on, put them on, put them on, put them on. Come on, this the we go, this is the way we roll. - That's it. - Come on, let's go. [marble falling] Oh, you fucking bastard. It don't matter, come on, don't matter, don't matter... You should try spreading your bets a bit. You know, cover a few more numbers. What, and sacrifice my potential maximum win? - No, no, no, bet big. - Win big. - Thank you. - Re-spin it. Come on, then, here we go. Here we go, bet big, win big, come on. Come on. [marble falling] [lan gasps] Yeah, 14 red's a bastard, it always fucks me. It's your race, look. Oh, yes, it is my race, it's my world, it's my Gazump. It's my Gazump a rump... do this... [indistinct chatter] [announcer] And there off. Oh, and Gazump has completely missed the break, he's given away several lengths to his rivals here. That won't be easy to make up. [Paul] I've bet on a fixed race look at that. You're right, it's a donkey. Fucking hell, run! What's he doing back there? Mate, I've been done... right, bollocks to it. There's still four furlongs to go, I mean, you never know what could still happen. No, it's bollocks. I tell, you it don't matter. That was an appetizer, that that was. Where's my coffee? You didn't ask me for a coffee. There's only one of me. [upbeat music] We're still good, Paul. Eight-to-one. It's too good to be true. You know what they say, don't you? Bet big, win big, come on. Come on, Phil, before you cut a fart, let's lay a bet. 1,100, love? What are you, me mom? Yeah, 1,100, you've gotta be in it to win, don't you? ♪ A gambling man, man, man ♪ ♪ A gambling man, man, man ♪ ♪ A gambling man, man, man ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah, yeah, a gambling man ♪ Your horse come back, man, it came third. Did you play it each way or to win? Always play to win. So, it's all or nothing on the next race then? No, it's just all. How witty, but is it? [shushing] [announcer] And they're racing, and Risk it all Paul, has got away to An Absolute Flyer. - It's a good start, mate. - It hasn't made a difference. It's better than a bad start though isn't it, Yiannis? It's not how you start, it's how you finish. [announcer] Cherry Bomb and Reality Checkers are trying hard to pull him back already, but Risk it all Paul is showing blinding early pace as they go through the early stages. Look at him go, look at him go, that's the way. Come on, man, win. Hold on, baby, hold on there. - [Jack] Go on, boy. - He's done it, he's gonna fucking win this. Hold on, baby, hold on, that's it! Please don't fuck me, come on, please don't fuck me. Please don't fuck me, please. [announcer] This is gonna be tight. Risk it all Paul is wilting. Here's Reality Checkers. Risk it all Paul is rallying. Reality Checkers and Risk it all Paul, they go past the post together. That's really close, it's a photo. Come on show the photo, what's this? This is killing me, come on. [announcer] Still waiting on the photo there, it really is tight and here it comes. Reality Checkers has won it... I'm off now, lads. You should always back it each way when you're staking four figure sums. Everybody knows that. Either that or back the favorite or the second favorite. Looked like it won to me. Risk it all Paul. Cunt. Unlucky son, yeah. [Yiannis] What, brassick, already? Same time next month, Paul, yeah? Yeah, just you try and stop me. [Jack] Paul works 50 hours a week conning the poor into signing their lives away for 25 years of paying interest. Staining his soul for the chance of winning in life on the last Friday of every month. But it's not Paul's day today, today's all about me, it's my day of reckoning. Deep down, I was just as happy as Yiannis that he lost. No one is stealing my thunder this afternoon and certainly no wage slave. The only thing you can get for 150 pound is a drilled piece. But I only can guarantee it for one shot, any more than that and the aim goes. And it's dangerous, it can go off in your hand. It's a blank gun that's had the chamber drilled and activated. It's what all the little rappers buy these days. And 150 pound includes a nine millimeter bullet already in the chamber. All you've got to do is take the safety off, pull back the hammer, and boom. - Sounds perfect. - You got expensive ones? Something cool like a fucking magnum or something like that? Where are they? They're in that case isn't it? - You want to buy a magnum? - No, not... Well, yeah, in an ideal world I'd like to, yeah. - Only for customers. - [Jack] What about AK 47's? I heard you've got experience handling those, too? And then out of nowhere, this little Albanian appears in the middle of the factory with Pipi, armed with a fucking AK 47, an AK, just like in the films. Nah, I've never had an AK, too big and too bulky for me. I'm too short to pull off an AK. Magnum, definitely, but not an AK. Can I have your phone number, please? - Why, do you want to buy? - Well, maybe in the future. I got fucking knocked for all my cash by a couple of fucking pikeys, you know, earlier on. I would have bought one off you straight away, mate, honestly, 100%. Well, maybe in the future we do business, get my number from Yiannis. And maybe in the future I show you a magnum. Now, I'm gonna grab a coupon and go. I normally bet football online, but I've been having problems with my net provider. Yiannis, good to see you. And, my young friend, give me a call when you're ready to buy the magnum. [Ian] Yeah, man. And, Jack, remember my friend, it's only good for one shot, any more than that... It's all I'm gonna need, mate. Good. [speaking in foreign language] Well, he was an interesting fellow. Yeah, but he's alright. Seriously, though Yiannis, man, I appreciate it, and, uh, Dirty Harry over here. [chuckling] [Ian] It's your race ain't it? [announcer] Heaven Sent giving his jockey a really hard time in the stalls here... And they're off, and Blue Cadet, the favorite, is off to a great start. [dramatic music] [grunting] Come on! [announcer] The closing stages, here. Heaven Sent and Envy... Come on! [announcer] Envy and Heaven Sent having a real battle as they go... Yes, fuck! You win the second race? Yeah, I did, man, but I'm not gonna celebrate just yet, man. God's got a way of fucking me up. He's done it to me my whole life. [Yiannis] Don't be such a pessimist. Look who's fucking talking. Oh, fuck off, you. Jack, you're gonna sort me out if it wins, too, right? Oh, he's changed his fucking tune now, ain't he? Listen, boys, now if it wins, I'm gonna sort you both out. You too, Carlton, man. [Yiannis] Good karma? [Jack] You know, isn't it? You know, I might be just stupid enough to think that if the shoe was on the other foot, you two would do the same for me? - You fucking know I would. - Absolutely. Jack, sweetheart, can I have a word with you please, babe? [Yiannis] There we go, Jack, you've pulled, mate. [laughing] Look, I've had head office on the phone and, um, well, that little wager you made earlier, it's made us all a bit nervous. Yeah? Well, you've been lucky so far. Phyllis, take a look at me. Do I look fucking lucky? Well, we'd like to settle the bet with you. [Yiannis] What's happening? We'd like to settle the bet, we'd like to buy it off you. I don't get it though, I've still got another race to go. You wanna settle a bet with another race to go? Yeah, but we'd like to offer you 30,000 pounds for it. - Take it. - No. If the next horse comes in, I win 500 grand. That's serious money. That's start over money, that's new life money. Why should I sell it back to them for 30 grand? If I'm sensible, which I rarely am, I'll be standing in the same situation I am in today, couple of months down the line. Nah, I'm gonna need the whole half a mill. It's not worth that much. [Jack] What is it then? - Round about 340,000. - That'll do. Sorry, can I help you, mate? Oh, no. Sorry, love, I'm on the phone. Don't be an idiot, it's seven-to-one for a reason. If they ran that race seven times over, your donkey, theoretically, would win just once. Take the fucking money. No, Yiannis, it's not even about the money, mate. If it wins, right, I'm a winner, man. If it loses, game over. Stop all this self-centered fucking bollocks, would you, and just think for a second, you stupid twit. Of course, it's about the money. You've never seen this much fucking money in all your life. Phyllis, he'll take the 30 grand, get the checkbook out. No, no, no, no, no, I'll wait for the last race. Phyllis, write out the check, he'll take it. Fuck off, Yiannis, alright! Look, Jack, sweetheart, this really is a life changing amount. I mean, babe, I'm not supposed to be telling you this but... You're right sweetheart, you're right. Keep your fucking mouth shut, yeah. You didn't give a fuck about me before, so don't go on like you care now, yeah. Don't fucking expect a tip either, Phyllis, if it wins, alright. Me and Yiannis, we're still waiting for that coffee. In fact, stuff your fucking coffee, it tastes like shit anyway, yeah. Yeah, man, I'm fucking starving, I haven't fucking eaten all day. Shall we go and get a burger or something? You didn't even ask me for a coffee. You know, if you ask me for a coffee, I'll make you a coffee. That's the whole fucking point though, isn't it? You never fucking offered did you, Phyllis, huh? The amount of money I've given you in the last few months, man, - it makes me fucking feel sick when I think about it. - [phone ringing] Come on, it's not like it ends up in my pocket, is it? [Jack] Well, you fucking act like it does, Phyllis. How quickly can you get here? Jack, don't cut your nose to spite your face. Please, mate, for me, take the money. Don't worry about sorting anybody else out, just take it. Look, I need to phone head office back and let them know if you're going to accept our offer or not. You know what, yeah? Everyone's gotta have their day one day, isn't it? Maybe today's mine, I mean, I doubt it, but you never know, do you? What's going on, man? [Yiannis] Jack's gone mad, that's what. They've offered to take his bet off him as it stands for 30K and he's turning them down. Fuck off. Ian, mate, do you wanna come and get a burger? Youse boys won't see me around after today, win or lose. You gettin' a burger, Yian, or what? Go on, then, maybe I can talk some sense into you. You fancy a burger, mate? That's very kind of you Jack, yeah. I'll see you over there. Last chance, Jack. Stick it up your fucking cunt. What did you say? Don't worry about him, I'll have a word with him. Yeah, you had better because I'll tell you what, I have barred people for less than this. Listen, sweetheart, do me a favor? Could you hold that bet back until the race starts? Look, alright, fine, okay. I'll stall it and I'll phone head office and see if they can hold on, okay, but only, only because you asked me, Yiannis. [calm music] What you gonna do with that money if it wins, bruv? I don't wanna talk about it just about now. What you gonna do if it loses? I said I don't wanna talk about it. I don't wanna give myself a heart attack. That's Bektash over there. Oh, yeah, Bektash, the fucking drug dealer. Look at him, looks like a fucking cab driver to me, mate. You guys wait here. I need to talk to him. Hey, Bektash, how you doing, my old friend? [Bektash] How are you, Yiannis? - Good to see you. - Good to see you. Listen, any more tips for the Turkish football this weekend? That last one you gave me, Besiktas, won five-nil, it was a really good tip. That was a good one, yes. I don't know, this week I'm thinking Bursaspor to beat Galatasary, yeah. I mean, I know they're the underdogs but Galatasary got so much injury problems nowadays, huh? And Bursaspor are on form. So Bursaspor to beat Galatasary? Yeah, five-to-one. Yeah, I'll look at that in a minute, yeah. What's that you've got in the boot then? - Ah, you've got a good eye, eh. - Yeah. It's basically a present for the girlfriend, you know. Persian rug for the girlfriend and I get some jiggy jiggy. [chuckles] Bektash, you old devil. Make sure the wife doesn't find out. She'd kill me. But, listen, I'd better go, huh. But I'll come round to the bookies tomorrow, alright, and we can talk properly then. - [Yiannis] Good to see you, my friend. - [Bektash] Take care, huh. Make sure you don't get caught. I won't... [laughing] [acoustic music plays] Get us a table upstairs would you, Ian? Get us a cheeseburger then, I'll go up and get one. Go on. [Jack] I'll get these, Yian. You ain't won anything yet, you know? So don't act like the big shot on your last score. It's, alright, I'll get these. Two king meals and a kid's box meal please, darling. [phone ringing] Hello, Avalanche Inn, how can I help you? Yes, we do Knickerbocker Glories. Do you believe in God, Yian? Well, that's a little deep for queuing conversation. - [woman] And one coffee? - Do you? [woman] Yeah, it'll be ready in five minutes. Well, I kind of have my own interpretation. Go on, let's hear it. I believe in good and bad, right from wrong. I believe that everybody knows the difference, everyone. What is the bible? The bible is an ancient opinion of how someone should live in a decent society, and offers a reward of heaven in return. It's a simple code of conduct. If you're good more than you're bad, you go to heaven. If you're bad more than you're good, you go to hell. It's the same across the board. Every religion, in essence, is more or less the same, bar a few tiny variations to the rules. Good is good, bad is bad. Good equals everlasting joy. Bad equals eternal pain and suffering. The problem is, men will always do bad... and they'll know they're doing wrong and whether you threaten them with hell or eternal damnation or whatever; they will still knowingly do it if they feel it necessary in whatever predicament they find themselves in at the time, and just hope that they can balance it out with enough good for the rest of their lives to make up for it. - The truth is, a real man... [tapping sound] will happily do something bad for the sake of his family, - even kill, if necessary... [tapping continues] whatever the deterrent. [knife tapping on the table] Jack. What? Let me see the gun. What for? I just wanna see it. After I'm eating. Come on, let me have a look at it before someone comes up. There's probably cameras in here. Don't be stupid, they ain't got cameras up here. Come on, let me have a look at it, man. [soft chuckle] [hard rock chord plays] - Jack. - What? You should have taken the 30 grand. [hard rock chord plays] Stop going on about it, Yiannis. I'm being serious. You should have taken it, it was the right thing to do. [hard rock chord plays] It's done now, so fuck it.

And it seems the devil you have chose for me comes in the shape of a camp gangster, a washed up fighter, and an out of date male model. One way or another, this version of me checks out, today, so how can I be frightened and intimidated when I've already laid it all on the line. I'm a man with nothing left, which means I have nothing more to lose. Intimidation might work with Yiannis, and Ian might be gullible enough to believe Yiannis's bullshit story about this clown killing two Yardie gangsters. But how can I be intimidated on the day of my resurrection? My pulse beats calm, my head is clearer than it's ever been. This is my final battle in my personal revolution, and whatever the obstacles you have put in front of me I know I have the will to smash right through them on the road to grace. I haven't had a Knickerbocker Glory since 1998. You see, I have the capacity to be fat, so I have to watch the calories. My mother was fat, so was my father, really fat. So I have to be careful. But when I saw they had this on the menu... I mean, most places don't even do it anymore. ♪ I am a man of constant sorrow ♪ ♪ I've seen trouble all my days ♪ - ♪ I bid farewell... ♪ Mm... [Jack] A gangster's greed can never overcome my quest for glory, and that's all it is, greed. How much more does he really need? I'm sure he already has a nice house, a flash motor, and sex on tap, but greed is what drives him to want more. Well, I want a go and I'm not greedy. I just want to know what winning feels like. Lean in a bit, Ian. A bit closer. Try that cherry. Now, how sweet is that? - It's sweet and yummy. - Sweet and yummy. In fact, you could say I've just lost my cherry to young Ian. - I'm Richard, by the way. - I know who you are, mate. Do you? Yeah, you're Richard Holt, people call you Holt. What people are they? I've lived round here my entire life, I ain't no mug. I know the people that are worth knowing about. I'm flattered. So, tell me what else do people say about me? - Are you a coke dealer? - Shut it, Ian! [Holt laughing] Mark... Mark, do me a favor, swap seats with young Ian, will you? Come on, come round here. Alright. Sit down, come here, let me tell you something. The innocence of youth, aye? I love it, I really love it. A drug dealer? You know, I haven't sold a wrap of coke in years. And I'm certainly not a dealer. I'm more of a... I'm more of a... He's more of a... a senior commodities opportunist consultant. A senior commodities opportunist consultant. Bravo, Zack, bravo. I take it that was a pre-prepared answer? Zack's been contemplating what to put on his mortgage application form. [chuckles] Got to put something down, you know. Fake pay slips or not, can't leave occupation empty, and that pretty much summed it up nicely. You should have put assassin, or something really cool sounding down. On my mortgage application forms? That's why you're still renting, Mark. An opportunist, one who takes advantage of any situation in order to achieve an end goal. Now, just because I've been known, in the past, to relieve the odd coke dealer of their associated possessions and sell it on to the highest bidder, that does not make me a fucking coke dealer. Well, in these times of recession, a man's got to make a living somehow, I suppose. My thoughts exactly, Yiannis, my thoughts exactly. A drug dealer? Young Ian, I've got a bit more class than that, mate. I heard through the grapevine that you killed a couple of Jamaican Yardies. Is that true or is that a bullshit? Jamaican Yardies? See, I thought it was bullshit, told the boys the same thing earlier. I told them you ain't got the eyes of a killer. I'm sorry, I just... I keep... I get emotional. The eyes of a killer? Yeah, the eyes of a killer, you ain't got them. The eyes of a killer, Zack. What a terrible, cliché thing to say. I mean, how corny is this guy? Well, have you ever killed anyone? No, I mean, I hate the sight of blood. But that's not the point. It's still a cliché, corny thing to say. Well, what about you? You're a fucking walking cliché, all three of you, the gangster and his goons. You two look like a pair of poofs. And you, you look like a fucking joke. I don't buy any of it. I'm not a goon, you ask anyone. I'm actually really a nice bloke. Is that what you actually do for a living, rob dealers? I take advantage of situations, young Ian. Take our friend, Jack, over there. Jack, currently has a betting slip on him that's worth 30K, and in approximately 15 minutes, that betting slip's either going to be worth 350K or fuck all. Now, Jack, I love your balls, mate, I really do. But I can't afford to take that chance. You see, you're clearly more of an optimist than I am. And here we all are, the six of us. You with the betting slip inside your jacket pocket. And this might be my last chance. And our friend, Yiannis, is right. I mean, opportunities are limited right now. Jack, you are gonna give me the betting slip and I'm gonna go claim my money. And in the meantime, you three monkeys are gonna sit with my two pals. And if you're well behaved, you won't meet my friend, Nagamaki. A fucking triad? [laughing] No, mate, you are brilliant, no, no. Nagamaki is a Samurai sword that I own and is currently in the possession of Mark. Mark go on, show them, go on. Look at that, young Ian, just have a look, so sharp, so smooth, so shiny. So... Jack, I hate to make threats, I really do. The betting slip. I can't do that, mate. I'm sorry? I said I can't fucking do that, mate! No need to get violent. Jack, no, no, no, no, no. You see, you're gonna force me to get into the whole cliché, alpha male, my dick's bigger than your dick type argument, and I'll be frank, I think it's quite tacky. But, I really have got a 12-incher in my pants So, if I don't choke you with that, that thing will cut you in fucking two. I can't let you take it off him, mate. I'm sorry, I can't. Is that what Pipi was doing at the bookies? Selling you that thing? That's a replica conversion. Pipi, what a ridiculous name. A ridiculous name for a ridiculous little man. You know, that's only good for one shot, right? Have you fired it yet? Not yet. So I take it the gun is yours, Jack. Alright, that makes more sense. So, Yiannis, are you gonna shoot me with that? I don't want to, but if I have to, I will. You're like a female Kangaroo. You know a female Kangaroo has got three vaginas, three holes to get fucked in; one, two and three. So, Mr. One Shot Man, who you gonna shoot? Yeah, but he's got the gun pointing at you, ain't he? So, you'll be dead first. What makes you think that I don't own guns of my own? And what makes you think that just because I underestimated your little crew this time around... Our crew. [Holt] Next time, I won't over compensate and rain down a hail of bullets on you when you least expect it? Well, it's me your trying to rob, isn't it? So, I guess it makes it between me and you. You wanna die or something? Depends what happens in the next race. You know, car crashes can bring us closer to our mortality. So, if you're feeling suicidal, what I suggest, is you give me that betting slip and save you any aggro later. Nah, I mean, you seem like a nice bloke and that, but I'd rather give it to someone I know. There's a parasite... it's called the toxoplasma gondii, and it can only sexually reproduce inside the guts of a cat. So, to that end, it infects rats and then changes their behavior, so the rats become less scared of the cat. Then those poor rats unwittingly walk into the jaws of death. See my little mate, Ian, he loves a little bit of bullshit. ["La Bamba" by Ritchie Valens] [Jack] Please, look out for Ian when I'm gone. Ian, wouldn't hurt a fly unless killing flies got you a hard man reputation. Unfortunately, beating up faux gangsters does, and Ian couldn't resist the opportunity to step out of the shadow of his dad's success and become the hero he's always seen himself one day becoming. [music continues] [indistinct chatter] Cheeky, fucking bastard. [speaking indistinct] - I've got you, mate, I've got you. - I know, bruv. That cunt, he deserved it didn't he? I fucking told youse boys, didn't I? I told you he's just a reputational rhino, didn't I? He half admitted it himself, didn't he? He admitted he hadn't killed anyone, right? Fucking weighed him in. It's all just fucking urban legends, you know what I mean? He will be back, trust me on this. If he's got the ballocks, Yiannis, to come back, which after a beating like that, I doubt very much. He even said it himself, didn't he, he said when we least expect it? But we're fucking expecting it right now, ain't we? Nah, he won't be back for at least a couple of days. Seriously, Yiannis, give me the fucking gun. I'll show this cunt who's a fucking killer. Look, we'll watch this race, and then we'll lay low for a couple of months, avoid this place. You fuck! I'll fucking waste you, man, you fucking piece of shit. Just in case he fucking comes back for us with a fucking bucket... you know. And you know only got one shot in that thing? You should have bought a fucking magnum, bruv. Next one to make a fucking move gets a bullet in the brain. That's it, Yian, fucking cool line, mate. [Yiannis] So let's just watch this race and go. He won't fucking come back, I'm telling you, man. He'll blow a bit of hot air and tell his pals how he's gonna kill us all, yeah. But he won't do fuck all. It's between me and you, yeah? It was between me and you. Oh, yeah... fucker. [Jack] Ian, you need to hold it down for a couple of days though, yeah. I mean, you're just a kid, mate, you know, stop hanging about in places like this with scum bags and fucking lowlifes. You'll end up like me, mate, in your 30s, not fucking two brown pennies to rub together, no friends, no family, no job... - Hear we go again. - What? Stop feeling fucking sorry for yourself. You just turned down 30 grand so things can't be that bad for you. Come on, Yian! That was my fucking move you bunch of fucking wankers! You just cost me 30 fucking grand! Only God can judge my decisions, Yiannis, good or bad, right or wrong. Listen, you two, fucking, thank you, yeah. Jack, bruv, honestly we... we properly fucked him up didn't we, bruv? Fucked him. Lookit, man, you think I'd let someone beat you, mate, in front of me? No, I was fucking, I was getting the better of him anyway wasn't I? [upbeat music] You alright, Holt? No, I'm fucking not alright. Zack... how much is it gonna cost me for their heads? - All three of them? - Yeah, all three of them. Hang on a minute, that's a bit harsh, isn't it? - I mean, we tried to rob them. - Harsh is it? Have you seen the state of my face? I've had worse. Zack... how much? And don't take the piss. Rich, I was expecting... an easy ten today. I'm desperate for the cash at the moment, mate. Since that 5K win, my luck has turned south and I can't catch a winner, no. So, I was playing this game the other day using this thing called a Martingale theory. Have you heard of that? What you do right, is you double the bet after every loss, so that the first win will recover all previous losses, plus, win a profit equal to the original stake. Supposed to be fool proof, but... This is really not the fucking time to hear about your stupid fucking betting theories. Now, are you gonna do the job or not? Alright, Rich, I'll do it. I'll tell you what, I'll do it for three per head. [Holt] Three per head? So you're gonna make money out of my misfortune? I stood to make ten, but now I've got to give that ten to you, is that right? Rich, don't be like that, mate, I am fucking skint. [Holt] Oh, he's skint. I'll give you three per head, but I want the job done, immediately. Those monkeys will be at the bookies right now watching the last race and you got about 15 minutes. Fifteen minutes Rich, no way. You joking? No, I'm not joking. Well, I haven't got a gun on me, mate. You specifically told me I wouldn't need one. Well, you'd better hurry up and go fucking find one then, hadn't you? Oh, fucking... Can't I do it tomorrow? You might not be able to find them tomorrow. Oh, there always at the bookies, Rich. Yeah, but they might not be at the bookies. I fucking really can't be bothered now, mate... [chuckles] If I go home, my missus, fucking she's gonna ask me all sorts of questions, "Where you been?" Zack. I do love you, Zack. You're a good looking chap, ain't you? And you got a beautiful mouth. Your nothing more than a cum bucket. You're a cock muncher. When you were fucking born someone shouted out, "Look at that cunt coming out of that cunt's cunt." So you see what I'm saying here, Zack, is don't complain 'cause I'll just get Luca Barbosa to come in. And he will do it for half the fucking price. You know what I might even get him to throw in you and your missus, how's that? Rich, Lucas wouldn't do it for less than three per head not on... not on short notice, no way. He did Jason Cole's cheating wife for two. Fuck off. I'm not taking sides here, but I did hear something bout that. Bollocks, Mark. I'm telling you he did, fat Lorraine told me. Tweedledum and Tweedledee. Fat Lorraine talks out of her ass, Mark. It's a competitive market, and even if Luca Barbosa won't do it for three, I guarantee you Christov Alexandrov will do it for two and half. This is exactly what I said would happen, right, when the EU lifted the migrant restrictions and Bulgarians and fucking Romanians. Will you shut the fuck up? Always gabbing away, ain't you? Does this face look like I give a fuck? Alright, Rich, alright. So.. this is the last time I'm gonna ask you. Are you gonna do it... or not? It don't matter, man, look I fucking... I just want you to know, bruv... I know you still have my back isn't it, bruv. I appreciate that shit, your my fucking boy, bruv. Fucking, boy. How's your nose, man? Fucked, isn't it? He caught me with a lucky one, fucking tosser. Look at us, mate. We look like a fucking pair of boxers, mate. Yeah, or fucking cage fighters then. Well, don't go too far, yeah. Well, listen, you're still gonna sort me out if it wins though, isn't it? Of course, man. Of course. What was that horse called? Punter's Prayer. Fucking, I really hope it wins, man, with all this fucking shit. It'll really change your whole life if it does. Fuck me, a half millionaire. It's too late to cash out now, so I guess all you can do is pray. Yeah, well, I've decided anyway, man, if it wins I'm gonna give 50 grand to the kids in Africa. [Yiannis laughs] You trying to trick karma again? Do you honestly believe there's someone upstairs who's listening to, and believing your bullshit? It's not bullshit Yiannis, yeah. Believe me, mate, the amount of people I'm gonna help out if I win this money, it's unbelievable, man. I'm gonna help the disabled, the local community, toddlers, the elderly. [Yiannis] Ian, do me a favor, mate, run down to the shops and get me some cigarettes, I ain't had one all day. And while you're there, get me a couple of pound of scratch cards, as well. Fuck that, Yian. That's wrong, bruv, honestly, they're fucking probably still looking for me, bruv. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I bet, a whole fucking army of them. Ian, man, I thought I shattered that gangster illusion for you, man. We... fucking bashed up that little poof in front of his goons, mate, yeah? Your fucking old man, he'd have been proud of you today some, mate. Don't ruin it now, mate. Go on, you go for me, and you can keep the change. [Ian] I can keep the change, and all you want is 20 scarabs and two scratch cards? Jack, do you want anything from the shop, bruv? - Jack? - What? Do you want anything from the shop? Nah, man, I just really hope this fucking horse wins, man. If there's a God and you're listening, mate, please, yeah. [Yiannis] Go on, run along, race is gonna start in a minute. Soon we're gonna find out whether our Jack has made the most genius gambling decision in history, or if he's just flushed 30K down the toilet. I'm going for a piss, Yiannis. [Phyllis] Jack, sweetheart. All or nothing, baby. Did you just tell Jack he could still cash out at 30K? Yeah, who's can talk some sense into him? I told you, I'd wait till the start of the race so you can change his mind. But you better hurry up though, it's gonna start in a minute. [Jack] I feel so close to you right now, closer than I've ever been. Even the distant scent of glory and success overpowers the stench of piss and bleach that surrounds me. [knocking on door] Who is it? [Yiannis] Jack, let me in, I need to talk to you. Hi, mate. Can I have, uh, 20 scarabs and I'll have two of them Rich for Life scratch cards... bruv. You got any white chocolate? What you see is what you get. You need more of a selection, mate. That'll be 4.65. Yes, fucking 50 quid! I ain't never won more than a pound on these before, boss. Maybe today's my lucky day. There is no such thing as lucky, lucky is just a state of mind. If you say so, mate. Here, can I have two more of them the same one? [phone ringing] Hello, Mom. Alright. Listen, um... I'm really sorry about earlier on. You're right, I need to get a job, but... I might have some really good news. No, I might have, it's difficult to explain. Alright, okay. No, you're... Yeah, you're right, okay. Well, listen, Mom, I'll be home in a couple of minutes we'll talk about it properly then, yeah. Alright, an then... Mom, you know I fucking love you, don't you? Yeah, alright, yeah, okay. Okay, I'll see you in a minute. Alright, bye. It's okay, it's okay... Young Ian, things have gotten out of hand and I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, sweetheart. I might not be a killer, but I know a man who is, and it hasn't cost me as much as you think. Three grand a fucking head. [operatic music] [rifle fires] [no audible dialogue] - [Yiannis] Jack, Jack! - [banging on door] Jack, they got him, they shot the kid. [announcer in background indistinct] - Jack! - [Jack] What? They shot him, I think he's dead. - [announcer indistinct] - What, what, what? - He's dead? - Who fucking shot him? - They shot him, Jack! - Who? [Yiannis] I think he's dead. [Yiannis sobbing] [announcer] Now the gap appears for a Punter's Prayer, who really starts to motor on the outside. Can he get there? A Punter's Prayer now begins to... [Yiannis sobbing] This is gonna be close. And a Punter's Prayer nicks it on the line, a Punter's Prayer has won. [gun fires] [rock music]
