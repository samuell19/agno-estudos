Butterfly forest before going to lung men you know who lives in butterfly forest? Yes, uncle's daughter, hsiao tieh suppose meng should love hsiao tieh he should not kill uncle but we got an order to kill him I already told him that love is not... For us in this line of profession yeh hsiang, you go and kill uncle you should have killed him long ago 3 years ago you were in butterfly forest... And you fell in love with... A pretty girl because of her poems she's hsiao tieh, uncle's only daughter the girl also loved you... But when this was known to uncle... He couldn't tolerate it so he sent han tang to kill you you two fought for three days & nights finally you were beaten by han tang... But the latter spared you since then, you became a drunkard... And have been drinking for these 3 years it was uncle who brought you to this state you should kill him in retaliation Look at my hands. Can they kill uncle? Besides, I can't kill hsiao tieh's father hell with hsiao tieh we got girls here? I can satisfy men better than any girls come, take off your pants! I want you to know I'm a real woman...

I was moving around... And came here without knowing it did hsiang chuan tell you... That you may move freely in the castle... But not in this garden if I had taken a nap here... As I usually did at this hour... You might have killed me, if you wanted to doctor? Men These here are my special traps tell lu to bring the man who shook the bell yes is the bell-man your friend? Only the doctor could be permitted to shake there're no families in this vicinity... & an ordinary doctor will not come here besides, the sound of the bell seems... To herald the arrival of a killer come with me, if you don't believe Uncle, the doctor is here you've come the right time we need a doctor Any patients here? No Fortunately, for I can't give treatment what can you do then? I can kill who do you want to kill? You, of course why? Because I heard no one can kill you men have you heard... That I have a bullet-proof garment now I see it I never imagined I can't kill you either Friend, what are you risking your life for? Nonsense Who are you? Do you remember that for your daughter... You asked han tang to kill yeh hsiang so it was you, and you didn't die han tang may not have killed me... But from that day I've become a dead body You came to kill me in revenge? I want to kill you before another does I also do it for hsiao tieh's sake go back, you'll get killed trying to kill I've been fed up with life these years as tieh's taken care of, I'll die peacefully Let him die if he's sick of living.

Who has killed many master swordsmen my name is meng sheng-hun uncle, the men you want are all here don't break the news of lu man-tien's death tomorrow morning, I'll attack roc castle one can easily fail...

Yes You, you... I used the seven-star needle you told me there's no remedy for it I had thought only you could have done it but I dared not believe it was you you made two mistakes in your life first, you suspected me, then trusted me second, you knew it & didn't trust yourself hsiang-chuan, have I mistreated you? No, but so long as you're alive... I cannot take your place it seems you collaborated with the roc chief only a strong enemy like him... Can frighten you you've put your trust in me only... Because your son and friends... Have fallen one after another otherwise, you wouldn't have... Given me the decree tonight, would you? Given me the decree tonight, would you? What about sun chien and han tang? Who else could have killed them... If not me? Who else could've killed han behind backs? What about lu man-tien, your uncle? He could have been spared... If you hadn't used meng sheng-hun you also killed many roc men in the inn I had to do that... To win your confidence it seems you've planned well of course, otherwise I could not kill you are you sure you can kill me? Absolutely... You can't move in your present state well, my last words to you are...
