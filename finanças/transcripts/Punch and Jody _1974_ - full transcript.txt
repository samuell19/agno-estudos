How you doing there, boy? Bye bye. Well, uh, how is the world of city corruption? My golf game has never been better. But any gym lately? Not thank you . Clean the last time through here. Lucky in cards and love. I, uh, hope you're here under a, uh, like a truce lunch . You know, I'm on your side, but my hands were tied in this. You just don't know Margaret. How, Grant, But, I mean, don't provoke. He's that tough. You know how I feel about a little. You think I would do anything in the world upset that relationship . Now you have a chance to mend your fences . Way. Gonna have a Saturday night. You ready? Waterloo? Little Bighorn and the mother howl , Children. Soul Margaret is a very dedicated all that with the warmth of the computer and the delicacy of a Sherman tank. So what do we do ? Do we go into Riverside with no advance?

You don't know anything about any of these children, right? Here, right, David, You know the name. You sure you know the name? But as far as what goes on in this fellow's head here, what makes him tick? What makes them run? Why? Maybe some of these children stay up a night. Why ? They cry No way, no way at all . Forgetting that the circus is our culture's last vestige of sentimentality. Again, the emotional display of any kind is that it fire work. Would I be spending life causes like this home? That's the point you're so wrapped up in cause you don't know how to get close to people. Don't you see sumptuous thing for you to say? Why? Because it's true. I have a very low boiling point, Mr Travers. Don't push me too far. That's a good sign. That means you're alive. You please go This grand Let's, please. Let's just forget the circus on DH.

Circus , that was your motivation was no, not really . Thank you. I was just trying to make some points, That's all. Not with you. Godzilla. Certainly not emotional level. According to you , that would be a waste of time. But I tell you what, Let's just say that this performance is in sort of, uh, what we tell her. It's a kind of apology, You know? People apologize. That doesn't come easily. No, it doesn't. Well, I guess you have a full day plan making last minute arrangements with barbecue. As a matter of fact, we do have a carefully planned routines are made to be broken , like how, like lunch. I don't see what that would accomplish. I didn't say a thing about accomplishing anything. That's what I want to do . Some fitness to travel way both know why you're here. And if you think you can sob you circus problems with the price of the frozen custard Hot dogger. You mistaken?

He's, um he's on the ground somewhere. No, thank you. Really? I married three, Mrs. Grant. I was just leaving. I mean, the last thing I want to do is be in the way. There's all kinds of things here I could be offering you. I know where he keeps his liquor, even though I'm not supposed to. I'm sorry, I don't have any ice keeps, but, uh, I know something that you'll like. Neat little transistor radio right over here by the bed. Or maybe you'd like to take a shower first. All day, just Jody. She threw you out. Quite the contrary. She almost tied me to the bed. You're kidding. No, I'm not. She knew all the tricks. Show me drinks. Soft music even threw in a few fresh towels. I don't believe I've never been so revolted in my life. Losing a child is a procure.

I thought it would be easier to talk to you like that . No. What's that number? State prison birthday present before? Who envy what? Tell me you never heard of it? No, I never heard of B. But if it's n be Charles his birthday, what do you mean, you're giving it to me? Because those were thinking people presents whose birthday you missed and I missed all of yours. You're not gonna tell me who n B. Charles ? When you tell me who cared a whole bar , It's for your museum. Yeah. The horseshoe ? No, she wouldn't qualify. It would be useful. May be valuable. Try a unicorn shoe . Okay. Uh, unicorn. You write what you have. There is a completely ninety totalitarian addition for you. I just got a telephone. Long distance. You know, this is a unicorn. You, uh, believe that? Uh, yeah . Peter, I refused to let you play games with that child's future is at stake, Jen. I don't even know what you're talking about. You couldn't just give a few happy day. You had to prove the old Travis job. Courage to think that you can depend on you promising the only promise I made was to look after until Sunday. You told her that it was permanent that you take it to court if you had to. Uh, well , I gather that's a direct quote from Jodi Card and a telegram. Relax. I'm sending the kid home on Sunday as promised. I'll let you know which flight. Maybe we could talk it over. No chance. It won't work. You have your life. Your your mother laid it out for you . I mean, around here, you'll just get confused. You'll start thinking that a pony shoes meant for a unicorn. Now Sunday you go home where you belong. Forget Sunday. There's a bus out of here. All right? That's a good night . Way to sweep you. I didn't forget about you. There you go. Don't drop it. You got it. I miss the performance. Uh , we were hoping the event What behaviors? We're hoping to give another one, uh, tomorrow night . Yes, I know. I behaved badly this afternoon. Well, at least you are checking out another. You know, emotion. None of the right one. Who said it was gonna be easy . Released. You're beginning to feel that's some and differently since your daughter called me. Jody. She actually called me to apologize for degrading me. Can you believe it? It helped me get things into focus. When I think the way I reacted in the trailer sanctimoniously, I actually saw myself being cheap and used. You didn't fool me at all. I knew you were in the morale building. So what? I don't know how to take, You know, it's not How you take me is how you take yourself. I got walked out on one side. I'm still scared. I suppose. I'll never know what would have happened if Jodi hadn't been there. I'll give you three guesses. I don't need three guesses. No. Hey, man. What is that? Rice And catch him something? No, I just thought of it. Oh, I made it. Dragon lady came through Palo Rice and ketchup. Rice. Catch it. You're kidding . What? What about Jodi? Come on, kid. I'm sending her back where she belongs. Yeah, but she's had a taste of something else . Sadist. All right. How does that stack up against a private schools and money and words like bovine? Uh, what about love? Come on . We're a couple of grifters. We we sell the illusion punch. She needs your love. Yeah , that's a highly overrated commodity. You said that yourself. Since when do you listen to me? Wait. Wait. Wait. Goodbye next. Hi . Well, judging by the look on Dan's face , I guess the marriage is off, huh? Well, to tell you true, it would be convenient if I love the guy. Unfortunately, I like him too much to short change, Johnny. No, but I'm not surprised. Why? She said something to me about taking the eleven forty five bucks. What? Crazy Tigers. No way! Break it up. Kill best friends whenever she was pressured me. Still no shooter. It's cool. It just cool it. Will you move this cage over here? Come on. Clear. Franz. I'm gonna try to bathe her lift. Hey!

Hold the door. I said, open the door! Good evening. Good evening. Which plane are you putting me on? Tomorrow? Well , you see your and Jan. I wouldn't like you. It wouldn't be safe. We had applying this that kind of weather. So I've decided that I think you should stay for a while. Whatever you think it's best. I don't think it's back for awhile. Okay? Yeah. Besides, you cheated. Never. In my whole life, nobody has ever beaten me and tic tack toe Without cheating , I could do it again. You prove it . Alright. Where? Eight. You sure you don't want a pencil paper? What? No. Yes. No. You're not the only one who knows conversational way. Wait. No.
