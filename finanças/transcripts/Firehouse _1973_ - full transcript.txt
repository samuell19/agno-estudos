MAN [ON RADIO]: 2220. [inaudible] [siren] MAN [ON RADIO]: Engine five, [inaudible]. Engine five, [inaudible]. [crowd gasping] Can you give me an elbow over here? Come on, [inaudible] over here. MAN [ON RADIO]: [inaudible]. [interposing voices] MAN [ON RADIO]: [inaudible] MAN: Come on, get that man out. We might-- [glass smashing] Where's Eddie? He just heard some gunshots, he went in after them I said everybody out there. That structure's going soft! MAN [ON RADIO]: There's a [inaudible] up on the southeast corner of the building. Get a truck company down there now. Say, my hero. Hey, Spike look what I got. Knock them out, baby, knock them out. MAN: Eddie! Eddie! Eddie! Eddie! Eddie! Eddie! [percussion playing dirge] I never felt so bad. It's like losing a brother. He was even closer. Your cellar gets flooded, who bails you out? Eddie Doyle. Put a new room on the house for the kid, and who helps you build it? Eddie Doyle. I think that's really killing me. Is he didn't have to die. I mean, they set that fire. Why? Why would they do a thing like that? Why do you think they set fires? They're black. Yeah, but why torch your own houses. They don't own them. They don't own anything. That's why they hate us. Because we're solid. We got something they don't. That's why. Here's to Eddie. Eddie. Drink up. Get me a beer. [laughing] I never thought I'd see the day you'd be shining shoes. Well, I'm a west Indian, baby. I don't have the same thing hangups as you state-side niggas. Hey, why don't you get that lovely body of yours off the bed and into the bath tub? This is an important day. I haven't been getting much sleep, Michelle. Been doing a lot of thinking. Thinking about what? About this job. Well, what's to think about? I don't want it. You're kidding. No, no. I'm not kidding. Been thinking about it all week long. Decided I'm not going in. Your first day, and you're not going in? I was hoping you'd understand. Understand? I mean, I know we've had our ups and downs, and I know we've been through hell together, but not going in? No, baby, I don't understand that. Now, look. You see-- No, listen to me. You half killed yourself getting through all those exams, and you know you had to work harder than anybody else, because you started four blocks behind them. And now, you're telling me that you're not going in. Well, that's beautiful. Michelle, all I'm trying to tell you is to stop kidding yourself. It won't work. That's-- that's a honky club down there. Then why did they accept your application? Tokenism. They don't want me. The only way that I ever fit in that scene is I become one of them. So don't go out here buying all new furniture and looking at no duplex apartments. Whole career's gonna end before it gets started. And what's wrong with wanting to get out of this hole, Shelly? I mean, my god, you got yourself fired from every job you've ever had since we've been married. Job? What are you talking about? Janitor, dishwater, porter. Baby, that's no job. That's bull! But this isn't bull, Shelly! Listen, once you're in that firehouse, they can't get you out. That's civil service. Now, look. They don't hold open that door too often. But when they do, you gotta zip right in there. Now, come on. Go in there and-- and take your bath. Then get down to the firehouse. And just give your wife a big kiss. Shelly. Listen to me. Every day when that phone rings, I die a little, because it's my mother calling to see if I've had enough of you yet. And I tell her, Shelly, I tell her I will never have enough for you because I love you. But she keeps that pressure on, Shelly, because she thinks you're no good. Now, I keep telling myself that she's wrong about you, and that you can get it together. But I'm telling you something, Shelly. If you don't get off this bed this minute and into that bath tub and then get down to that firehouse and start making a life for the two of us, I am leaving you, Shelly. Well, that's what I want to know, Gene. Yeah. [sounds of ping pong] Are you sure? Well, that's just what I thought. No, no. Don't worry. Nobody's gonna quote you to the press. I give you my word. Right. My best to Kathy. [sounds of ping pong] And what'd I tell you? That fire was torched. I just got off the phone with this friend of mine [inaudible]. They get a debris break down? They sure did, and it showed gasoline. You called that, Spike. Well, let's wait till the report comes in. Are you kidding? Now, look. It all locks in-- the [inaudible] pattern of the fire, the chemical analysis. Heard they even found gasoline cans a block from the fire. PARR: All right, Spike, leave it alone for a while. Nobody saw who did it. No, but you can make book it's somebody's black. You must be the new man. Forsythe? That's right. I'm Captain Parr. Come on up. I'll sign you in. [honking outside] Welcome aboard. Can you believe what they sent us? PARR: Come on in. I have a set speech for all the new men, Forsythe. But we can forget about that. Sit down. Cigarette? No, thanks. Uh, look. You're on probation here, which means you're not a fireman yet. And you'll be taking a lot of needling and a lot of scutwork for the first few weeks. We all did when we were probies, and we expect everyone else to take it in stride. Um, there's just one thing I ask of you. That is not to take any of this personally. As far as I'm concerned, your only job here is to become a good fireman. Clear? Clear. There'll be no fighting in the house, unless you want to go up on charges, which could mean dismissal. Oh, and one other thing. I run a dry house. No drinking. No dope. Well, I haven't shot up in at least two weeks. [laughing] I, um-- I'm AA myself. This bottle's been here for eight years. Can I ask you one question? Shoot. Am I the only black in the house? Well, you're aware of the fact that one of the deputy fire commissioners in this city is a negro. Is that right? Sure. Deputy March. I thought everybody knew that. Well, I'm sorry. I just-- just didn't notice him downstairs. We'll get all the paperwork done and see about getting you a locker. Hey, you guys. Hey! You gentlemen have any suggestion for the mid-day cuisine? Anything. I got one. Send out for Chinese. Hey, how about some veal and pepper gyros? MAN: No, no, no. [inaudible] peppers? Pepper and eggs? No more peppers! He puts peppers on everything this week. I'm turning into a lousy pepper. All right. Meatballs. Without peppers, huh? [chuckling] Well, that's that. That's what? The break room. I was beginning to think that this place really had a charm on it. It's the coming thing, Spike. There's one in every firehouse. It's a political deal. There's no such thing as one. Now, you mark my words, Myer. They'll be coming out the woodwork. Any day now. Oh, come on, Spike. He's only a probie. And anyway, I could use somebody in the kitchen. Now, probies don't cook, Caputo. They sweep the floor, you hear? What are they doing up there? The welcome speech, remember? I never heard it. I got here first. Maybe I don't have Jim Parr's civil service rating, but I was here first. My tail has seen more flame than any two captains. We're not arguing about that, Spike. As far as we're concerned, you're still our man. Here, here. I second the motion. Right. And what do you know, wop? Boys, this is the new man, Shelby Forsythe. Shelly. Right. This is Hank Myers, our engineer. Spike Ryerson, our senior man. And this is the darling of the firehouse, Sonny Caputo. Hi. PARR: He feeds us. Dalzell's around here someplace. Billy? DALZELL: Oh, yes, Captain? Let's have a locker key for Forsythe. Um, but the only one that's free is Eddie's. Well, let's have it. OK. You're giving him Eddie's locker, too? What's wrong? Well, you can't do that. PARR: Why can't I? SPIKE: Well, it's not cleaned up. Why isn't it? Nobody wants to touch it. Spike, come on. Eddie's gone. Let's clean house. Give the new man a locker. Hey, listen. I know he was a friend of yours. And, eh, I'm sorry, man. What do you got to be sorry about? You didn't do it, did you? Look, since I didn't know him why don't I give you a hand, huh? Keep your hands off his things. I don't care what anybody says. This is Eddie Doyle's locker. Now, you're just renting it till you're out of here. That's going to be for a long time. So don't you hold your breath. [alarm ringing] [bell dinging] MAN [ON PA]: Attention, Engine 23. You are second in at box 5009, located at Grand and 97th Street. [bell dinging] Come on! Let's go! [alarm ringing] [bell dinging] MAN [ON PA]: Repeat, you are second in at box number 5009-- [honking] [siren] [honking] MAN: Another false alarm, Captain. Anybody talk to those kids over there? No, but I think you should. [radio chatter] Any of you guys see who might have set off that alarm over there? You know, every time we answer a false alarm, it costs the city $500. Every time. Where are you going? Talk to them. I just did. Yeah, but let me give it a try, OK? What do you got to lose? [radio chatter] What's happening, brothers? Don't call us brother. Your brother, he over there. Look, man, you know, your old lady could be dying in one of these fires, and we couldn't get to her because we had to come down here and play this game with you. So what you wasting your time down here for, whitey? Later. Don't call us. We'll call you. Sure took care of that, didn't I? Well, anyway, it wasn't a complete loss. At least Spike got his kicks. Yeah, you crazy about him too, huh? It's tough not to be. He's some kind of a fireman, you know. Terrific. [heartbeat] What kind of a nut sends a false alarm, anyway? A pretty sick one-- the guys that set the fires, they're the real psychos. DALZELL: Yeah, you just ask any shrink. Hey, fellas, we had visitors. Well, they took it? The television? The television. DALZELL: Again? Again. We just finished paying for it. Oh, wow, they probably stole us blind. Job is fantastic, man. When are they bringing the whips? Oh, if I ever get my hands on them-- Eddie's camera. Well, do you believe it? They don't even have respect for the dead. How are they supposed to know he's dead, man? Yeah, that's right. Yeah, yeah. That was a pretty dumb remark, wasn't it? Well, maybe my brains are still scrambled when it comes to Eddie. You see, he was only my best friend. Now, how many times do I have to apologize for that, huh? Well, back to the old razor blade. They got my old electric shaver. What difference does it make with that peach fuzz of yours? Animals. Busting in here like this. And we just got through paying for the TV set. Animals, that's what they are. They're worse than that. Sonny's right. They're lower than animals. Yeah, you're right, man. Anybody who'd break in a place like this and rip it off, that's chicken. Only who's lower than animals, man? I mean, who are "they?" Well, man. I mean, like, eh, they're the funny little guys who set off the false alarm and then come and burglarize the firehouse. The same people who like to throw bricks at firemen. You'll see that happen one day. Maybe they'll roast your butt. They're the same people who like to pour gasoline and see the buildings burn and don't give a damn when a cross-beam and two tons of cement come crashing down on a guy's head who's trying to save their home. That's who they are. I thought you were talking about niggas. Well, you said it. I didn't. I want you guys to remember that. Just remember it when he takes me to the Human Rights Commission. What's going on here? Forsythe. I thought I told you not to take anything personally. So you did, Captain. Just clean forgot. [baby crying] MICHELLE: Hi, honey. Hey, mama. Gee, did you have a nice day? Beautiful. Oh, hey. That's obscene conduct in at least 38 states. But I love it. Love it too. Yeah, it looks good. Yeah? I didn't know if you'd be eating over there or not. Well, it you call red peppers eating, I guess I ate. And it really went well today, huh? Like I said, baby, fantastic. I know you did. And in fact, I've never seen you so high after a day's work before. Guess we lucked in this time. Yeah, or maybe you stopped off for a drink somewhere. Hope to die. I just feel real good, baby. And you did go in? I tell you what-- tomorrow, I'll bring you my time card. How's that? Oh, Shelly, that won't be necessary. I just can't get over you liking the place. Like I told you, it went fantastic. And the people? What people? The people you work with. Are they friendly? Are they open? Distant? What? Oh, those people. Oh, those people. Well, I'll tell you, they're all fantastic, from the captain on down to the newest recruit. Fantastic. And, eh, how many of them are black? Actually, it's a very interesting situation. Meaning you're the only one. The only fly in all that buttermilk. And you've putting me on. And all this time I've been buying it? Like I told you, baby, it went fantastically, so don't you start bugging me. Oh, great. Do you know how many questions that fills me with? Really? Yes, really. Well, I got just one question for you. What? What the hell is that suitcase doing in that closet? The one that's usually in the basement? I was down there getting some things out of there for-- for tomorrow. And I just couldn't work up enough energy to put it back. Is that right? Well, would you like me to put it back for you? No. No, just-- just leave it there, because I don't know where I want to put it yet. Gin. How many points you got? 10. 17, 27, 37 I got. And 25? 62. Makes it three in a row for Spike, and a blitz on the third game. Terrific. Get yourself another pitcher. Hey, Ernie, get me a soda, will you, like a good guy? Oh, yeah. Sure. Uh, anybody else? No, thanks. You know, I wish I had a personal slave. Hey, Caputo, what do you want? The guy is a fire [inaudible], and I just happen to be the best fireman in the city, right? It was love at first sight? Hey, do you know he's got a 1936 Ford Pumper in his backyard? What? You gotta be kidding. No, it's the truth. Well, he's harmless. Hey, listen, in case I forgot to mention it to you guys, eh, I've been thinking about, eh, transferring. You gotta be kidding. What you want to do a crazy thing like that for? SPIKE: Why not? You clowns are starting to bore me. Ah, here. Ernie, did you hear that? Spike here, he's gonna leave the firehouse. I don't believe it. It wouldn't be the same. I mean, whenever I mention Engine 23 to anybody in the department, they say, oh, that's where Ryerson is. Do they, now? Well, you know it's true. Besides, this was your father's company. Why would you want to leave it? SPIKE: That's true, Ernie. But, eh, this place just ain't the same anymore. I mean, it's hard to put a label on it, but it even smells different. Yeah, I noticed that. Every time you open your mouth. Hey, come on, Spike. What do you wanna transfer for? You're the senior man in this house. It doesn't make sense. He's just a probie, Spike. You're going to transfer because of some probie? Come on. SPIKE: Yeah, that's kind of unreal at that. I mean, when you really think about it, if anybody should have to get out, it should be him, shouldn't it? All right, come on, you guys. Dig in. There's applesauce for dessert. Hey, Forsythe, come on. Probie's gotta eat too. Well, how's the corned beef and cabbage? Can't you smell it? You stunk up the whole house. Hey, I made it for you, mick. [forsythe laughing] What's so funny? Corned beef and cabbage for the mick. Meatballs for the dago. You think that's funny, huh? Well, if we're going to have classics by request, I demand equal time. Tomorrow, I want ham hocks and greens and black eyed peas. I'm sorry. But I'm not familiar with that particular cuisine. PARR: Well, Forsythe will prepare it. A little soul might add a new dimension around here. It would, Jim, but probies never cook. I mean, they shop for groceries. They, eh, wash vegetables, and they do dishes. But they don't cook. Well, considering the fact that our knew man has the talent, I think we can make an exception. [alarm ringing] [bell dinging] MAN [ON PA]: Attention, Engine Nine. Engine 23. [inaudible] You are first in at box 4518, located at 222 Seamen Avenue, odor of gasoline and [inaudible]. [bell dinging] [alarm ringing] [siren, honking] [siren in distance] [inaudible] stand by. Neighbors called it in before it got started. There's enough gasoline in that cellar to blow up the whole block. Anybody see who started it? No. Should I send in a special call for the phone unit? It's already been done. Gasoline. They're at it again. PARR: Another gasoline job. SPIKE: I heard it. WOMAN: [speaking spanish]. You understand what she's saying? She says passed a kid in the hallway who smelled like gasoline. [spanish]. Come on. [spanish]! I'll take this building. You take that one. [struggling] I didn't do it. I swear I didn't do it! Then why do you smell like a gasoline station, huh? Look, man, I'm not the one you want. He paid me. Who? Man, I can't tell you that. He'd kill me. Come on, let's go. Hey-- he gave me $25. Here, take it. Take it, man. Come on, let's go. Hey, man, you know them honkies, they hate us. Come on, don't let them turn me in. DALZELL: Forsythe? Are you black, brother? Or are you white? Forsythe? Hey, did you see him? Forsythe? Hey, did you see him? No, I didn't see him. I thought you said he wasn't there. I told you I didn't see him. Hey, you know what I was thinking on the way back to the house? What? That maybe we'd get lucky and get ripped off again. What's so lucky about that? Well, I thought maybe they'd steal your meatballs. Wait'll you're hungry the next time. [caputo laughing] There was a funny thing that happened today when we was chasing the fire bug, guys. What's that? Well, me and the probie, we went flying down this alley looking for the kid. Now, each of us went into our own separate garages. When I came out of my garage, I asked the probie if he'd seen the kid. The probie says no. So, we go back to the pumper. As we were walking back to the pumper, this kid comes flying out of the probie's garage and takes off down the street. Now, that's pretty strange, isn't it? Huh? SPIKE: Not so strange. They're all like that. Black first, firemen second. [exhaling] Ernie said you wanted to see me, Myers. Yeah. Take it, Sonny. Yeah. You gotta relax, sometimes, Forsythe. I thought maybe you'd like to join us. You work out? I used to do it in the army. You're welcome to use them. After you finish-- Hey, I'm finished right now. Come on. Don't weigh much. You can handle it easy. No trouble at all. It's been a long time. All right. Now, we'll give you a hand. [inhaling deeply] Nothing to it. Looks good. There's a lousy rumor going around that you-- you let that firebug get away. Now, we want to know if that's true. -Not true? -Are you sure? SHELLY: I'm sure. Are you 100% sure? Say it. Say you're 100% sure. 100% sure. You know we put our life on the line out there every day. You understand? You understand that? Yeah. One thing we don't put up with is a fireman who isn't 100%. So if you're thinking of not being 100%, you better pack your gear and get out. Now, swear you didn't let him go. Swear it! SHELLY: I swear it. I sweat it. I swear to god. Let him up, Sonny. That's enough. Let him up. Put it down. OK. From now on, we're gonna be watching you, understand? He puts up a terrific fight, doesn't he? [cackling] Shelly? I didn't hear the alarm go off. It didn't go off yet. Then go back to sleep. It isn't even 5:30. Look, I'm sorry if I woke you. Next time, I try to blow silent smoke rings. Well, now, what's that supposed to mean? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Nothing means anything more, especially in this room. Well, now. That doesn't require any explaining, does it? It doesn't, huh? Oh, no. That's a straight out up front complaint. Sweetheart, come on. Well, you know what they say about us jigs. All sex maniacs. Shelly. Do you think my life's been one long orgy lately? Well, maybe not. The reason nothing's happening in here lately is because this damn suitcase is beginning to strangle me. And I mean all over! Shelly, I never meant to do that. How could I? I love you, Shelly. You are all I love. And the only reason why I've been bugging you about this job is because I thought it would bring us a happier life. Michelle, listen. I am hanging in there. I don't care what those honkies to try to make me quit. I'm hanging in there. And I can deal with all of that, as long as I know you're with me. You dig? I dig. So if you don't mind, I'm putting that suitcase back where it belongs. Later. Put it away later, Shelly. Hey, Forsythe. SHELLY: Yeah. I got a special detail for you. Come on with me. Now. See this here? Yeah. Well, there's a piece of hose missing. Number R217. So? So find it. That's your special detail. And where might it be? Somewhere in there. In there? In there. Or, in there. Well, come on. Move it. Any luck? Did you find it? If it's in here, it's in that last bin. If it's in here. How come I got this job? Well, tell you the truth, it's a rotten job. But all the probies get the rotten jobs. Hey, man, when I was a probie-- Who gave you this job? What difference does it make who gave me the job? It has to be done. We have to account for every piece of equipment around here. And a piece of hose-- And don't tell me he saved your life too. Are you asking me if he's a friend of mine? No. I just want to know who I am dealing with around here. No, no, no, no. You're asking me if he's a friend of mine. Well, I'll tell you. Last year, when I was on vacation up in Cape Cod, my right lung collapsed. Guess who flew all the way up there to drive me home? Spike Ryerson. And who brought in his own TV set when ours got ripped off the other day? Ryerson. That's who you're dealing with around here. Fantastic. And when does he walk on water? All this hose has to be put back in the bed. Forsythe, I got a special project. The captain wants you to hit the third floor. Yeah? Gotta get it ready for inspection. Fantastic. When was the last inspection, man? During the Harding administration? All I know is what they tell me to do. And what they did to you to tell me to do? I gotta go gas up the pumper. I'll come back and give you a hand if I get the chance. Just spruce it up, can you? Sure. Sure, man. But you tell whoever's running this operation that [inaudible] worse. [inaudible] the outhouses. [inaudible] it's like being on a vacation. Fun in the sun, you dig? So you go tell the man that. Where do you come from? You go to school around here? Yeah. School of mother wit. No kidding. I went to Mother Cabrini myself. Is that right? Hey, let me tell you something about our firehouse. It takes a little time to get used to the new guys. They gotta get used to you. Like, eh, an association, you know what I mean? When the guys give you the OK, they'll anything in the world for you. And when you're finally in, you're going to find you don't need anything. It's just like a family. SHELLY: Family? Yeah. Man, I got a wife. I don't need anybody else. Hey. Did somebody say that you're a cook, eh? I hope so, because Caputo's, eh, cuisine, it's, eh-- it's a disgrace. It's OK. I tell him that to his face. But can you cook? I mean, eh, really good? Hey. A cook in a fire house is a very important man. Man, that's all behind me now. I don't remember how. I were you, I would try to remember. Myers, you're beginning to sound like an underground worker for the Panthers. I'm not an underground anything. Just a fireman. OK? Yeah, I take that back. You just don't like peppers. Hey, not bad first start. Now, get yourself over to the tower. Is that where they do the tickling torture? Dalzell's hanging hose, and he need a hand. Fantastic. Any objections? No, nothing worth mentioning. ERNIE: Forsythe. Yeah, Bush? They giving you a bad time? [chuckling] No, it's all in the spirit of good clean fun. Oh, don't let it get you down. Plenty of guys dying to be in your shoes. No, kidding. Well, take me, for instance. I could never pass the physical. Lose 20 pounds and I'll trade you jobs any time. Auditing books for a [inaudible]? You'd go out of your mind. No, no. This is the job. You know how long I've been hanging around Engine Company 23? Only five years less than Ryerson. Terrific. And I know more about it even than he does. I've got pictures of this station when it was first built in 1910, when it held fire wagons and six teams of horses. Bush, look, I got a date with a couple miles of fire hose, OK? Oh, no-- [inaudible]. Um, I wanna-- I wanna talk to you about something. Uh-- um, I don't-- I don't wanna see you turned off by these guys. Um, I-- I know they've been treating you rough. You gotta-- you gotta try to understand why. I know why. They test all probies. No. No, that's not why they're rough on you. Not only here, but all over the country. You see, uh, being a fireman is different from being a cop or, uh, working in a post office. These-- these guys have to live together. So you gotta understand why they feel invaded. So, uh, as a good liberal, I'm asking you to, uh, give them some time and let them work out their problems. Good liberal? Yeah. As a good liberal, how much time do you need to work out yours? You know something, Shelly? All the new firehoses have hose dryers. Why doesn't this one join the 21st century? I don't know. All right, come on, you guys. Get the lead out. Little more. Little more. All right, hold it. Give me some slack. Back down. Little more. All right, tie it off. SPIKE: Hey, Forsythe! Forsythe, now hear this. We all know you let that firebug go. And we know why. So you better be ready for me. I'm ready for you right now. No, no, no, probie, you still got a few hours more work to do. They tell me that sump pump needs cleaning. Is that right? That's right. Now, you meet me in the handball court at 6 o'clock. We'll see how ready you are. MAN [ON TV]: From the first [inaudible] company commander or battalion officer must make an immediate [inaudible]. --[inaudible] put a light on in here. Shh. MAN [ON TV]: --trapped inside. Immediate rescue action, probably in conjunction with hand hose streams and [inaudible] protective cover must be taken-- What do you wanna be an officer for? You'll end up like Parr. Stay with the men, you'll be better off. MAN [ON TV]: Steps must be taken to halt the spread of fire to adjoining structures or hazards. I didn't see you there, Jim. I-- what's the matter with him? What's the difference? It's all changing. Everything. Everything's changing. There was a time when it was something special to be a fireman-- something special. I mean, people used to bring cold lemonade in the summer, hot coffee or soup in the winter, because they knew-- they knew if they called on you for help, that-- that you were there. Fire or disaster, you were there. You were laying it on the line. Not as if the guys who are doing it for $1. We weren't making much. I'd come back to his house after a real work. I tell you, burns up and down my arm, up and down my neck, the hair on the back of my arms all burned off, my eyebrows singed, my lungs half filled with smoke. And I felt terrific. I felt good.
