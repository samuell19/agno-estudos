Hello, sir. Sir, I am Mahantesh. Please be seated, sir. How are you, sir? All of them are my people, sir. There's no problem whatsoever. Please be seated. What is all this? - 'The guest is like God'. This is how we provide hospitality to all our guests. My Boss has strict orders for me that none of our guests should leave empty-handed and with an empty stomach. First of all, tell me why I am summoned here. We came to know that you are investigating a case from your department people. No one can do anything without our knowledge, sir. Sir, in Prestige Villa near Nandi Hills, we have booked a villa. A land of ten acres near Magadi Road. An imported Benz car, 2019 model. Brand new! Some money for the expenses. It is about 10 crores worth in total. If you want to own all these you should stop your ongoing investigation and handover the evidence and proof you have collected so far to us, sir. My father is Madhukar Deshpande, a retired School Headmaster. He receives a pension amount of Rs. 20 thousand per month. My wife is a bank employee who earns a salary of Rs. 60 thousand per month. The government pays me Rs. 1 lakh as salary. This is enough to live happily. The evidence and proof I have will reach where they are meant to. Please excuse me, sir. Tell me, sir. - Did he accept our proposal? No, sir. Not yet, despite giving everything as we planned. Give him another chance. - Okay, sir. I will try. Sir, my Boss has given you another chance. A bedbug can only bite, not kill. I am not a goat so that you can lure me with some greens. You should do your duty honestly, sir but not over your dead body. It is wrong even to raise your voice in front of an IAS Officer and you are threatening to kill me! The law won't spare you. Reporting live from Home Minister Durgaprasad's house. On the occassion of his son, Aditya's, birthday.. It has been 30 years since I entered politics. The common public and the media has helped me reach this stage without any Godfather so I would like to thank one and all. Sir, is it true that you are going to be the next CM candidate? - No. A person's image should never overshadow his party. I will abide by the party seniors' decision. I have invited you all here to introduce you to our new youth president. Sir, is it Arjun? - No, my second son Aditya. "To sell sugarcane juice, I have come from Mandya.." "To serve you, I am waiting in a sari.." "To sell sugarcane juice, I have come from Mandya.." "To serve you, I am waiting in a sari.." "Come on...come on, everyone.." "Come on... come soon, everyone.." "Come on...come on, everyone who wants some juice.." "Who prefer juice over drinks.." "My name is Singaravva.." "Come, let's dance over a glass of juice.." "My name is Singaravva.." "Come, let's dance over a glass of juice.." "As soon as I come, the street lamp switches on by itself.." "Yes, it does.." "As soon as my veil slips, people start whistling.." "Yes, they do.." "Touch the feet whoever want to.." "Offer devotive prayers whoever want to.." "Set the display pic whoever has taken a selfie.." "Advance bookers, wait in the queue.." "If I leave now, you will have to wait for a year.." "If you want to pick me, you will have to get Mallya's flight.." "Elders, younger ones, the ones sitting and the ones standing, listen carefully.." "My name is Singaravva.." "Come, let's dance over a glass of juice.." "My name is Singaravva.." "Come, let's dance over a glass of juice.." "One, two, three, four.. What next?" "Yes, it continues.." "Five, six, seven, eight, the count continues.." "Yes, it does.." "Everyone playing hopscotch, stand still.." "Everyone who wants me, sit together.." "Everyone who wants to join my party, hold my hand.." "Everyone who has brought a gift, stand first in the queue.." "If I get lost in the dark, it will be difficult to find me.." "Then you will have to rent moonlight to find me.." "Everyone from the first visitors to the last, listen carefully.." "Singaravva.." "Let's dance.." "Singaravva.." "Let's dance.." Hello, sir. Please find our son. The department has taken this case quite seriously. It is on a search for him day and night. Have patience, no matter who is behind the missing case our department wouldn't spare them. You be strong. Sir, I can ask her to be strong but how can I console the two lives who are dependent on him? Don't mind me asking but is there a problem in your son's personal life? My son's personality is as clear and transparent like crystal. Do not blemish it. That is not my intention. Shedding tears and getting heartbroken won't solve this problem. Instead, if you can cooperate with the investigation it would be great. Sir, tell me what cooperation you are expecting from me. If there are any government documents or his official documents please hand them over to me. My son has never brought his office files home. Get me his personal things like pen drive or hard disk which he might have used regularly. It would help the investigation. Sir, it's time for your meeting. - Okay. I have an important meeting to attend, please come back next week. Immediately, handover his pen drive or hard disk if you find it. Okay, sir. Sir, please show as much interest in my son as his laptop. Let's go, dear. Breaking news that IAS officer, Shubhkar Deshpande is missing. Let's go live to our reporter Mahesh. Shubhkar Deshpande has been missing for some days under strange circumstances. A complaint has been registered to the Police Commissioner regarding the same. An IAS Officer going missing is the third instance in the last six months. Is it a coincidence or... A politician or an industrialist is involved in it is the public's question. I don't think the police would be of any help. Dear.. In office, did he.. What the heck are you saying about our son? How can you talk about him like this? Look how she left crying. In her condition, we should be her strength not think and talk rubbish. Sumitra, honest officers always face problems in every step. Understand that. Okay, but we did roam around looking for our son, didn't we? Tell me if any one person come forward to help. I have always believed that truth always wins. When someone is in trouble, some force will definitely come for help. What force is that? Get out of my way, stupid! - Oh, God! Goddess Kannada, no matter where one comes from you proved that they should live here with their heads bowed down symbolically. I salute you, Goddess Kannada. - Hello? Oh, a ghost! - I am not a ghost, I am a coolie. Where is your item? - You.. You are a Kannadiga, right? - Yes. Then ask it in Kannada. - Where is your thing? What the heck! - Doesn't it sound bad? So, I asked decently where your item is. This is my.. Hey, who the heck is that.. - Hey, you stand still. Wi-Fi? Wi-Fi? Wi-Fi? Wi-Fi? - Give me your item. - What is he looking for? He has lost his thing. - Why look for it, just feel it with your hands. Hey, are you talking about luggage? - Yes, exactly. Yes, come on. Wow! Wonderful! - Abhi, look for a coolie please. Yes. - You pay for the gym to exercise, can't you workout here? Everyone can carry a bag each. Am I right, Abhi? - Yes, my mother. Ammu, let's go. - Let's go. Where did my Wi-Fi go? Wi-Fi! Wi-Fi! Hello! Are you selling Wi-Fi or looking for it? I am looking for my Wi-Fi! Did you see my Wi-Fi around, sir? - How can one see a Wi-Fi? Don't get confused, sir. She is my wife. - Oh! She is the one. She is from a Hi-Fi background, so I call her Wi-Fi! She was connected all night, but now there was a network jam, so she got disconnected. If she is Hi-Fi, how can you find her in a 3-tier AC? Go look for her in first class. - Shut up! Sir, if my Wi-Fi gets connected to your network, please make one Jio free call. I will come running to get her. - Okay, okay. My phone number is.. - Tell me. - 9000420420 is your number, right? How did you come to know, baby? - Everyone was talking about your number all night. Sir, give me a call. I will come back. - Hello, come here. Can I give you a suggestion if you don't mind? - Sure, sir. You should set a password to every Wi-Fi, otherwise others will get connected. - Yes, sir. Be careful. - Okay, sir. Sir, my sunglasses. - Oh, I was just trying. Thank you, sir. He returned my sunglasses, but he said something weird. Forget it. Wi-Fi! Take my bag, dear. How is it? - Nice! Anju, isn't the house nice? - It's beautiful! Oh, as if it is some Ambani's house. Get up, naughty. We should unpack the luggage. - Would you make me work? Be careful, the police will arrest you on child labour charges. - Oh, God! You are crossing your limits. - Okay, Anju. You get settled, I'll get something to eat for us. Come, let's go upstairs. Anju! Abhi, this is too much. - That's how love should be. Your hands are too fidgety, take them off. - Ask my hands then. Now, will you let me work or not? I am not disturbing your work, but your cute face is. This cute face makes want to propose to you again. Then we should join college again. - If you are ready, I don't mind. I am craving for that feel again. - Of course, you are. But you are always busy with your work. - Anju, you are an inspiration for my work too. Your smile is my energy. If you are with me, I can win the whole world. Abhi, get up. I am getting late for school. It's my interview today. We are getting late, can't you wake up? Sleep for five minutes, dear. - Idiot, you get ready first. He'll get ready too. Teeth always support tongue, not the nose. - What are you murmuring? Nothing, Mom. The understanding between you both is superb! - Thank you. Darling! - Wake up, Abhi. She has an interview in school today. Also, we have to get the service exam details for Ammu. - But.. Oh, yes! I forgot. God knows how to make you and your daughter understand things! We will understand if you say it nicely. - Oh, really? How? Like this? Brother.. - No, like this. I am sorry, I am sorry. - Nothing, come in. Shall I go get the exam details? Anju will come with you, don't go alone. - Yes, I will come. - Okay, Brother. Do well in your interview. - Bye, Mom. Take care. You are the naughty one, you be careful. Okay? - Got it? Bye. - Bye, Abhi. Abhi, have you made sure the school is a good one? Mom, it's one of the best schools in the city. I don't want one of the best schools, I want the best school. Once you join, it will become the best. Come on now. - You understand me so well. Auto? Where to, sir? - Rajajinagar. - No, sir. I won't come. Sir, where are you going? - To Rajajinagar. I am going that way too. Come, I will drop you there. And you are? - Your neighbour. Oh, the new occupants? - Yes, sir. Come on. No problem, I'll hire an auto. - Grandpa, Abhi won't carry you on his shoulders. Come on, hop on soon. - Please come, sir. See you. - Okay. - Bye, Grandpa. Is the advocate available? - Yes, he is. Abhi, the teacher who interviewed me wasn't so intelligent, was she? - Why do you ask? She asks me to score more than 90%, does she have the knack to teach me so well? I beg of you, zip your lips. We are the ones who pay the fees, so we should interview them. Once you study well and become an officer, you can conduct the interviews. Abhi, ice-cream. Mom, I will buy you an ice-cream, you will catch cold and your mom will scold me. Is this all necessary? - Your fear for mom is more prominent than your love for me. I can never argue with you. Which flavour ice-creams do you have? Do you have a twin brother? - No, I don't. Wi-Fi Uncle! - Oh, yes! - Thankfully, at least you recognised me. Baby, which flavour ice-cream do you want? - Butterscotch. Butterscotch! - Okay. Anyway, why did you join ice-cream business all of a sudden? My Wi-Fi doesn't like cheap items, but loves licking ice-creams. I am hoping to find her while selling ice-creams. - Here you go. So, you didn't find your Wi-Fi? - It's my tragic story, sir. I am just a basic model, she might have got connected to a smartphone model. I tried looking for her in rich people's areas like Sadashivanagar and Dollars Colony, but in vain. I even looked for her in UB City hoping she would come to party there but I didn't find her, I found my doctor though. Which doctor? - Dr. Mallya. Did he return from London? - I don't know, sir. My Wi-Fi is somewhere around, but not getting connected. - Forget it, let's go. Did he leave already? Sir, won't you give me any advice today? I thought to, but then you would feel bad. - No way, sir. Please. If it is not getting connected in spite of trying so much, there must be a problem in your device. Give it for servicing. - Okay, sir. Thankfully, no one saw it. Ice-candies! Ice-candies! Here, have some water. What happened? Who fell down? - Don't know, he felt dizzy. Sir, what happened? - I just felt dizzy. Are you feeling better? - Yes, I am okay. Should I take you to the hospital? - No, I am fine. Come with me, sir. Get up slowly, sir. Bye, Grandpa. - Thanks a lot. Mom has already returned, you get in. I'll be right back. - Okay. Mom! Sir, is everything fine? I am quite old, so it's just tiredness. It's natural, but you look like you are in some kind of stress. Share it with me. No problem if you don't want to share it with me, sir. I am sorry. A moment. What was his mistake? He is a public servant, he did what was expected of him. Is that his mistake? I am an ordinary school teacher. I have educated hundereds of people. I worked so hard to get him educated. He studied hard and got through IAS exams. He worked efficiently everywhere he was transferred. People loved him so much, but what did it get him? Influential people got him transferred to different places. He worked honestly in every department he was sent to. Finally, he came to health department. He worked honestly there. He got married last year since we forced him to. Everything was going good till last Monday when he went to office as usual but he hasn't returned yet. We looked for him everywhere, made so many calls, but all in vain. The police received a missing complaint, but did nothing about it. Didn't the media do anything? Well, what they did was made it a breaking news for a couple of days. That's it. All the media wants is breaking news. But if a movie actress gets married, her wedding will be telecasted live the whole day. But officers and army sacrifices are trivial matters for them. She waits all day long for her husband. She tries calling him every half an hour. My son is an IAS Officer, but what has the government done for him? Nothing! I know that it is of no use. The whole system is corrupt here. Nothing is possible here. Don't think you are alone. You have been meted out injustice. I will do what I can to get you justice. Be strong, ma'am. See you, sir. Hello, sir. - Hello, sir. Hello, sir. - Thank you. Goa State Government and our NGO would like to honour you. Please attend the function without fail, sir. You want to honour me out of love, so definitely I will come. - Thank you, sir. Bye, sir. Good afternoon, sir! What did you do about Shubhkar's case? - Oh! He is no more to do anything about it, sir. His father is an old man, his visits to the police station is not going to help him, sir. I have built this empire stepping on many dead bodies. I cannot neglect only because it is a small spark of fire. It can destroy the entire forest. Did you come to know what documents and reports was Shubhkar talking about? Not yet, sir. But you don't worry about it whatsoever. I will look into it. - Okay, go now. - Thank you, sir. Sir? If you do it on your own, it's best. If you let your son do it, it's good. But if you let your servant do it, he'll ruin it. Do you know who the servant here is? The commissioner, sir? Good! Send our men and get the file. - Okay, sir. Coming. Dear! - Close the door. - What happened? What happened, dear? Oh, God! Why are you sweating so much? You are exhausted. You are injured, did you fall somewhere? Did you get hurt? Wait, I will get you some water. Oh, God! Here, have some water first. Oh, God! You are sweating profusely! Tell me what happened. How much are the carrots for.. Rs. 300! Rs. 300 per kilogram! Yes, sir? - Green peas, please. Teacher, how long would you have green peas? You should have only mutton and chicken hereon. Because no one would sell any vegetables to you. You are a teacher, aren't you? If you don't understand the lesson, I will have to teach you in my own style. Once you reach home, find the evidence for us. Evidence? - Drama Teacher! It was just milk now, in the evening it will be blood. We will be there in half an hour, find the evidence for us. Who are these people? What are they even saying? What evidence are they talking about? Where should we get it from? Hard disk, pen drive.. Moreover, he hasn't come home. These people are demanding strange things. I am afraid. Calm down. He would be fine. I have a severe headache. - Calm down, I will get you some coffee. I will get you some coffee. Oh, God! Oh, God! What happened, dear? Why did you fall down? - What happened? Please get some water. - Yes, right away. What happened, dear? - Just felt dizzy. - Oh, I see. Here, have some water. - Drink it. Don't go anywhere. Don't open the door. Wait. Please don't.. Oh, God! Sir, what's wrong? I heard some noise.. Sir.. - Actually, she felt dizzy. What happened, ma'am? - She hasn't eaten proper food for two days, so.. I can understand your situation but isn't it wrong to punish your unborn child? Your child is your husband's image, it's your responsibility to take good care of it. Have something and take rest. Take her along, ma'am. - Yes. Get up slowly, dear. Everything will be fine. Sir? Why do you look afraid, sir? Don't think too much, everything will be fine. Please sit. Hey, let's come back later. - Okay, come on. Hello? - The missing IAS Officer's dad Deshpande is trying to pressurise me every way possible with someone's help to get the case reopened. Damn it! - What's the problem that you are so restless? I have to contact sir immediately, but he is not receiving the call. Mostly, he is in the award function. - There's time for it to get started but even the award company people are not responding. His image is at risk. Whose image? - Sir's. What do you mean? - Yes, sir. Shubhkar case is getting reopened. Deshpande is pressurising the department to get the case re-investigated. Do you think that old man can do that? That old man's neighbour is supporting him, sir. Don't call dad for such trivial matter, I will handle it. I am so hungry. What would you like to have? - Abhi, I want some popcorn! Brother, there he is. Who are the rest? - His wife, sister and daughter. Get his sister. I want to go to the loo. - I will take her, you be here. How much? - Rs. 80, sir. Let me go! Who are you? Brother! Brother! Brother! Brother! Let me go! Brother! Brother! Let me go! Brother! Brother! Yes, your case? Sir, my sister has been kidnapped. - Get the complaint registered with the writer. Sir, please come with me. I will give you all the details on the way. I said, get the complaint registered first. Sir, please register a complaint. - Give me the details. My name is Abhi, when I went to a shopping mall with my family some goons kidnapped my sister. In which vehicle? - White Fortuner, sir. Did you note down the vehicle registration number? - I did, sir. KA-05 M 5656. Say it again. - KA-05 M 5656. Where did this happen? - Sigma mall, sir. This doesn't fall under our station limit. So what, sir? You can file a zero FIR and take an action. We know what our duty is, you don't have to tell us that. Station limit is important for us, you stay in your limits. Do you even know on whom you are registering a complaint on? Sir, but.. - Stop talking and get going! Get lost! Sir, my sister has been kidnapped in a White Fortuner vehicle. The registration number is KA-05 M 5656. They all looked like goons, please help me before a mishap happens. Did you notice her being kidnapped or your sister went with them willingly? Your sister's boyfriend must be there, so she must have eloped with him. What the heck! I have seen it with my own two eyes. Vasanthnagar Police says that the case doesn't fall under their limits and here you are talking nonsense. Sir, tell me if you can or cannot do it. If not, I will approach the Commissioner. What's that nuisance in the station? Why are you shouting? My name is Abhishek, I came to register a complaint about my sister's kidnap but he is talking nonsense. - Shut the heck up! Anil, you shut the heck up. Now, you tell me. Did you see where this happened and who did it? Anil, check the car details. - Sir, that is Home Minister's son, Arjun's car. Great! Now, you will register a complaint and we will fulfil our duty heroically but tomorrow you will come to withdraw the complaint fearing the influential people. Hence, our time, government fund, pen and paper will go waste. You should have the guts to face the consequences of a complaint registered. Do you have the guts? I will handle the rest. - I don't care if he is a Home Minister's son or the CM's son my sister is my priority, sir. Are you sure? - I am ready for the consequences, sir. Excuse me! Where is Arjun? - Sir, he is in a meeting right now. Sir, a meeting is going on inside. Please wait for ten minutes. Brother, the police is meant to wait for the law, not the criminals. Forgive me, everyone. Hello to everyone. Sorry for the disturbance, but I need to talk to Mr. Arjun for a while. What is this nonsense? There's an important meeting going on. How can you barge in like this? Wait in the reception. Listen, Brother. I haven't come for a blood test or a urine test that I wait in the reception. I have come to enquire you. And the reason is? - KA-05 M 5656 Fortuner! Isn't this your car registration number? - Yes, so what? He has filed a complaint that his sister has been kidnapped in that vehicle. - Kidnap? Call Adi. Not reachable, sir. My younger brother, Adi, is using that car. As soon as the phone connects, I will call you. You can leave now. - Spare your orders for your people. If the elder brother is asked to wait in the station, the younger one will come running. Hey, are you trying to be arrogant? I am so influential that forget me, you can't even arrest my security guard. How dare you challenge me! If I can, I would drag you on the streets to the station. How dare you! Bloody rascal! You have messed with fire, not just any policeman! Come on. Officer, you are doing a bloody biggest mistake. Why do I care who you are? Everyone is one and the same in front of the law. Malleswaram Sub-Inspector Kiran Kumar.. - Home Minister Durgaprasad's son.. Arjun has been arrested.. - Watch the visuals here. Excuse me, sir. Please watch the TV. Arjun Prasad has been arrested. What are the charges? Why has he been arrested? We will provide a detailed report on that after a short break. - Damn it! Sir! - What the heck is this? Give me some time, sir. Your son will be released. If he gets released, will my honour and respect that I have lost would be restored? Sir, you rest assured. I will look into it. Sir? - Cancel all my appointments and book me a flight ticket to Bengaluru. Okay, sir. Sir, only one question? - Sir, please.. Who the heck is the station in-charge here? - Sir! Don't you know that you should inform the seniors before handling such sensitive cases? Sir, a girl has been kidnapped in his car. When I went to enquire about it, this scoundrel raised his hand on me. If you raise your hand on his prestige, wouldn't he react? Apologise to him and release him. Sir, instead of appreciating the sincerity you are asking him to release the criminal. Who are you? - Sir, he is the one who complained about the kidnapped girl. Hey, who do you think he is? He is the propreitor of Arjun Group of Companies. He is one of the business tycoons. Forget him, can't you understand that he is the son of our department head Home Minister Durga Prasad's son? Does the law says that we shouldn't complain if a Home Minister's son commits a mistake? Hello! I don't have to explain all that to you. Kiran Kumar, release him. Sir, the FIR is registered. - Shut up, Kiran Kumar! The car belongs to Arjun, but he has filed a missing complaint on the car a week ago. Sir, my sister was kidnapped in the same car. I have seen it with my own two eyes. Isn't it your duty to take an action on the FIR registered, sir? I don't have to learn how to do my duty from you. Once I find out who the real criminal is, I will arrest him and lock him up. So, it has been proven that law is not reachable to the common people. These colourful words sound good but if you say one more word, I will have to arrest you too. Your irresponsibility is the reason for all this mess. You are suspended! Sorry, Mr. Arjun. It is our mistake, I am extremely sorry. Mr. Bhairappa? - Yes, sir. Take the one who has filed an FIR on Arjun in custody and enquire him. - Okay, sir. Arjun sir.. - Arjun sir, why were you arrested? - Please answer only one question. Arjun sir.. - Sir.. I am sorry, Mr. Abhishek. The system won't allow us to work honestly. It is full of such influential politicians and corrupt officers. It is better to sell vegetables than working under the likes of them. I am sorry, Mr. Abhishek. Sir, you have released the Home Minister's son Arjun within two hours of his arrest. What's the reason, sir? - Just a minute. The real fact is that Arjun's car has been missing for a week and he had filed a complaint too but my officer has made a mistake by arresting him without a proper enquiry. Sir, have you got any clue yet about the missing car being used to kidnap the girl? Yes, we are investigating about that. The enquiry is underway to see if the complainant and the kidnappers are connected in any way. Move. Sit over there! A new twist to the Home Minister's son Arjun's arrest. The police is enquiring the complainant. Sir, everything is clear here. I have suspended the Inspector who arrested Arjun. Would suspending him restore our lost respect and honour? How dare he touch the Home Minister's son! The complainant should know who I am and what I am capable of. Go outside. Good morning, sir. - Some of my men are coming to the jail. Make all arrangements they need. - Okay, sir. There's a call for you. Tell me, sir. What makes you remember me? Bunty, there's a prey for you. He is in jail. What do I have to do, sir? - What does a tiger do to a goat? I got it, sir. It will be done. Hey, get the heck out of here. Uncover his face. Run! Everybody run! Sir, please get me released. Please, I have to go. Cool, Bunty! What's wrong with you? He will kill me, sir! What the heck! Who can hunt a tiger? Stop this tiger nonsense, sir! I am just a street dog in front of him! His name alone is enough to send shivers down the spine! I am hiding in this jail only to be safe from him! He is the lion of Bihar! He is the "Rustum" of the police department! Okay, copy. Put the barricades and block the road. The police has put the barricades. The police mean nothing. Don't worry, crash into them. Come on, crash into them! Crash those rascals! I don't think they'll give up. Look over there, there's another policeman! Crash into him too. Come on! Crash into him! Police, you can do nothing. You can keep me in the jail only for four days, then I will be free. I will see what you can do. Come on, arrest us. - Arrest? To me, arrest is like an allery and encounter is energy! - No, sir.. What does he think of himself? The word arrest is not in his dictionary. He shoots anyone he catches. Everyone he shoots is either a criminal or outlaw. But that doesn't mean he keeps shooting everyone. The Human Rights people are filing complaints against him everyday. What can we answer them? Thanks to whatever he is doing, the goons have become scaredy-cats. He is being a hero gradually. He is known as a "Rustum" in the department. Sir, Abhishek sir is here. - Send him in. Jai Hind, sir. Is there another complaint against me, sir? The Human Rights people will obviously complain if you keep carrying out series encounters. At least, there should be some difference between the police and the goons. Of course, sir. Every goon is afraid of me but I am not afraid of anyone. I haven't shot any innocent or a policeman but only goons. Where there are criminals, there is Abhi and that is the rule I live with. I hope you all got my point. Jai Hind, sir! Sir, if you leave him free, who is going to control him? I have transferred him to a place where we can keep him under control. Where, sir? - Patna city. Hi, pal! How did you like this place? It's the dead end on all four sides. Like every criminal's journey ends at a dead end. I don't like violence, so surrender yourselves. Arrest everyone. - Okay, sir. Arrest him. - Come on. Take him in. - Arrest everyone of them. No use arresting them, sir. If you say yes, I will shoot them right here. - No, Yadav. Encounter is not a solution to every crime. Sir, they are dangerous criminals. All they can take to their head is a bullet and nothing else. - No. Yadav, no matter how the criminal is we should give him at least one chance to change himself. We have been given revolvers to protect the law not to break it. Sir! Jai Hind, sir! Jai Hind! Chulbul, what's up? I am doing great, sir. Meet the new officer...Mac.. What? Mac? - No, sir. It's Makhan Pandey. Oh, Makhi! Makhi is my name, killing is my fame. But don't kill houseflies.. Sir? Hello, sir. Hey, Shivu! What brings you here? I am where you are, sir. - Stop flattering me. Jai Hind, sir! - Jai Hind! The Officer is calling you up there. - Don't send me up there so soon. I have to send many people up there before I die. What do you say, Shivu? - Yes, sir. May I come in, sir? - Yes. Jai Hind, sir. - Jai Hind! Sit down. - Thank you. So, are you reporting today? - Yes, sir. So, what do I call you as? Abhishek or Rustum? The name is not as important as the people's love behind a name. Love? Are you spreading love or fear? I am helpless, sir. Because this is Bihar where 'Gandhigiri' is overshadowed by hooliganism. - So? Will you kill everyone in an encounter? Are you "Ab Tak Chhappan"? - I only stay in the north, sir but I am still a southerner by heart. I have crossed a century. So, are you a "Century Star"? - If people call it with love and pride, I accept the name. I agree you are doing a good job, but your methods are bad. That's how my way is, sir. There is something called rules too, Officer. Rules and regulations are good only for school children, sir. Not for the bloody criminals. Sugar? - One. In the last six years, this is your ninth transfer. Medals and promotions make you happy, but transfers make me happy. But the department is not happy with you. Wherever you go, you increase the heart rate of the criminals. But crime rate is decreasing, sir. You better be under control here, Officer. I am your higher officer, remeber that. You are a DCP, so you are decent and silent. But you are indecent and violent, aren't you? That is only for criminals, sir. Because that is the only language they understand. This is my office, your ways don't work here. Only my way works here. You better know that you are working under me. No, sir. We both are working under law. You have not changed a bit. We shouldn't, Bharat. Neither in friendship nor in work. Even you behaved strictly with me, but you couldn't hide that smile. Buddy! Come on, let's have food at home. - Yes. Oh, home! If I don't go now, I will be doomed. Abhi! Abhi.. Hi! - Hi! How's your mom's condition right now? - Like thunder, lightning and storm put together. So, she is furious at me? - Of course, she is. You just went to office. Neither the luggage is unpacked nor have we eaten anything. So, it is a strike situation? - Not just strike, surgical strike. Surgical.. - Go apologise to her without arguing with her. What? Why should I apologise? Just watch. - Get me down first! Darling! When I am here in flesh and blood, what are you doing with my photo? The photo is way better than you. It looks at me with love. It does, but it doesn't actually love you. Don't come too close, maintain distance. Why are you still angry when I am here? You said you would be back in a jiffy, are you? It has been four hours. Do you even care about your wife and daughter? Okay, I am sorry. Let's go outside for lunch. Okay? - I don't want to. Go finish your work if anything is left. I said, I am sorry. What more do you want me to do? That's the nature of my work. I am just a little bit late. Now, do you want me to fold hands or fall at your feet and beg for an apology? Okay, fall at my feet and beg for an apology. - What? I said, fall at my feet and beg for an apology. - Really? Fall at her feet, otherwise she won't calm down. Anju, actually it's not good for a wife...I mean a husband to fall at her wife's feet. That's not true. In Bhagyavantaru movie, Annavru has touched his wife's feet. Why? Why did your Annavru do something like that? - Abhi, I am serious. Okay, I am serious too. Should I fall at your feet? Fall at my feet and beg for an apology. Till then, I won't calm down. - Okay, darling. Only for you and only for you to calm down Abhishek, IPS Officer will fall at your feet and beg for an apology. Oh, God! I am sorry! - Abhi! I know that you won't let me fall at your feet. Now, the duet song. - Okay, baby! "You are my police baby.." "I am your naughty baby.." "You are my police baby.." "I am your naughty baby.." "I will give you kisses in a cage, don't miss them.." "I am your prince, don't be upset with me.." "You are my love minister.." "You are my heart minister.." "You are my one and only home minister.." "You are my police baby.." "Baby, baby, baby, baby.." "I am your naughty baby.." "Baby, baby, baby, baby.." "Come on, darling.. Touch your cheeks with mine.." "We are trending, lock your lips with mine.." "Is it, darling? Look at the moon in the sky.." "Prepare for love shopping.." "Let's turn the data on and watch YouTube.." "Let's love in 4G speed.." "Baby, baby, police baby.." "You are my police baby.." "Baby, baby, baby, baby.." "I am your naughty baby.." "Baby, baby, baby, baby.." "My Barbie doll is a sureshot Kannada medium girl.." "In the cycle gap, she taught me a poem.." "You are a warrior, awesome in wrestling.." "Let's build a kingdom while kissing.." "In a cold place, let's sweat.." "In zero degrees, let's become hot.." "Baby, baby, police baby.." "You are my police, baby.." It's very hot in summers, please let's not go there. Stop! None of you should plan the trip. - Why so, baby? Rachana, we wanted to plan a trip but this ACP and DCP.. Do you know what their plan is? - Hey, wait. Let me guess. Wagah Border or Dehradun Army Camp? - Yes, exactly! They'll shed their police mentality. - It's okay, what does your mom say? Anju is one boring girl. She wants to go to Ooty or Taj Mahal. - Naughty! Where do you want to go? Even I don't know, but it should be adventerous.. - Adventerous! Shall we go on a foregin trip? Bharat, when is Ammu coming? I miss her great ideas. Here she is. Hi, Brother! - Hi! Perfect call time! What's the specialty? - When someone is bored of his nagging wife a best friend gives great happiness. Look here. Hi, Ammu! - Hi! How are you? - Hi, Ammu! - Hi! How is your preparation going on? - Superb! How are your boyfriends? Ammu, we are missing you so much. - Yes, Ammu. Even I feel like being there with you when I see you all together. Poor girl! - Come on, let's plan a foreign trip. Definitely! Another 15 days and I will be there. - Okay. Okay, bye! -Bye! - Love you! Sir! - Hello. Hello, sir. Hello! What's the case? - His name is Aslam Pasha, sir. He is a retired Head Constable, he has come to meet you. Yes, what's the problem? - My granddaughter hasn't returned home since yesterday. What's her name? - Shaheeda, sir. Did you enquire at her school? - Yes, sir. They are saying that she left at four last evening. By any chance, did she go to a friend's or a relatives's house? She is nowhere, sir. She doesn't go anywhere without informing. Everyone at home is worried, sir. - Have you brought her photograph? Please find my granddaughter, sir. Sir! Circulate this photo to all the stations. - Okay, sir. Alert at all the crowded places like bus stand, raiway station, police station. - Okay, sir. Get the Principal. - Okay, sir. The Inspector has come to see you. Hello. - Hello. Do you know this girl? - She is our school student, sir. Who drops her home? - Mishra does. Is he a driver? - Yes, sir. - Call him. Sir? - He is Mishra. - Hello, sir. - Hello. Sir, I stop the bus here and the kid goes home by this route. That's her house. Okay, sir. Sir.. - Play it. Rewind it. Enough. It's a well-planned kidnap. - Yes, sir. The number plate is not visible, they have covered their face too. He threw it with his left hand. Is there a criminal who is a left-hander? Sir, he is a left-hander. His personality looks like Siddiqui's. Siddiqui? Where can I find him? - The highway dhaba is his permanent den. Sir, I don't think he will come today. Let's wait for some time. - Okay, sir. Why do you worry? I assure you. We must teach him a lesson. Sir, there are two more accomplices along with him. Chotu, three teas. - Okay, Brother. Three teas for brother. Sir, shall we attack them? - No. Just be alert and wait for my orders. It's Shankar Brother's phone. - What is it? Yes, Brother? - Chotu, is the work done? We are at Radheshyam Restaurant. - How long will you take? We will be there in five minutes. - Okay, come quickly. Okay, Brother. Brother, ball! Chotu, collect the money. - Attack! Police! Tell me where the kid is. I have more bullets than questions. Will you tell me or should I shoot you here? Our work is only to kidnap children, sir. I don't know anything more than this. Who is behind this? - Bunty Yadav, sir. Bunty Yadav! Move, come on. - No.. - Shut up! Shut up and move. Come on, shut up! Slap him tightly. - Come on, take them away. Here's your money. Who the heck are you? - Your death! Police! Police? Look around you. You will wet your pants in fear. Hey, I am the definition of fear. The pants will be wet, front and back. Hey, cut him into pieces. How dare you sell children! Sir.. Please.. - Sir, please forgive us. Sir, we will not repeat this mistake. - Sir, please don't kill me. Kids, you haven't understood my character yet. I am allergic towards arrests. But, encounters give me energy! Hey, Abhi! Stop it, what are you doing? - Can't you see? Clean India Movement! I am cleaning the dirt. These dirty scoundrels do not deserve to live. Hey, don't shoot. Cool! Sir, I came to save one child, but he is sending children in groups to different states. As if he is some distributor! Killing such people would save many families. The court will decide what punishment he deserves. Not everyone will understand Bhagavadgita lessons, sir. Some need to be taught in Bhagat Singh's way. Draw and win right here! - No! We should just make sure that a crime is punished, not punish them personally. Such people won't get punished, sir. A wolf will be there somewhere to save such dogs. Damn it! I have never waited for so long in my entire encounter history. Give me two seconds, sir. I will shoot him.. What the hell is this? - I can't help it, sir. This is not the right way, Abhi. - Okay. I am sparing him only out of respect towards you. You dog, listen to me. If you ever show yourself to me again, I will shoot you right there. Get lost! Move, rascal! Take him away. Boss, I made a mistake. Please spare me. Bloody rascal! - Boss? Bunty Brother has been arrested. Hey, call the MLA. Tell me, Boss. - What the heck is this, Minister? Some officer has arrested my people. Don't worry, Boss. What do you think I am here for? I will get him released. Sundar Pandey is my name. It's apparent. You are very handsome. I am the MLA of this constituency. - So what? The people you have arrested are my children. Get them released. That is impossible. If you want, I can lock you up too with your children. Hey, DCP! Don't try to mess with me. Don't be so arrogant. If they don't come out in five minutes, I will get you ousted. I am sitting in this chair to work, not to talk to anyone. Jai Hind! Neither will you have any work, nor your arrogance. There are two kinds of dogs, one barks and the other bites. Well, I am not scared of any. - Who did you call a dog? I will cut into pieces. I will cut you into pieces and spread them over the entire district. If you don't listen.. - How dare you! What the heck! - Abhi, why're you hitting him? Abhi! Oh, God! - Stop it! What do you think you are doing? They have least respect for the police. I had told you that a wolf will be there somewhere to save such dogs. This MLA has come for the same. Get the heck out of here! Listen to me.. Abhi, don't hit them! - I said, get out! Abhi, stop it! - He has gone crazy! You dog! - How dare you call a policeman a dog! - Abhi, stop it! You rascal, get up! - Stop it! Just stop it! Are you out of your mind? Yes, one shouldn't be alive when they have committed enough sins but these people live only to commit sins! - Abhi, stop it! Where the heck is everyone? Come on in! Hey, move back! - You are not allowed inside. Being a police officer, you are behaving like a goon! This bloody dog was abusing you and you did nothing about it! When I am not reacting to it, why are you? Would you forget your limits if you get angry? Remember that I am your senior officer. You are my servants, Madrasis! Not a Madrasi, I am a Kannadiga! Abhi, just cool down! - Do you want to see what a Kannadiga is capable of? Hey. stop it! What are you doing? Sir.. Mr. Abhishek Bhargav, you have crossed your limits. I am sorry.. For misbehaving with your higher officer you are suspended! Leave! Hello? - Boss, where did you send me? That officer is crazy! He has no value for MLA. Moreover, he was going to shoot me in the station. I somehow saved myself. - The elections are round the corner. Let's be sensible and hit them when the time is ideal. Hi, Abhi! The game is too interesting today. Come on, let's have a duel. Come on, Abhi! Dear, you go play. Come on. Dear! - Mom! I said, go play! Don't be naughty all the time. Baby.. Baby.. Abhi. - What? - What's happening here? Why are you being rude to our baby? Because I am crazy and irresponsible. What happened? Why are you so upset? Anju, do I have to say everything to you? Just leave me alone. Get out! Bygones are bygones, don't think too much. We never know how some situations arise! Abhi must be hurt. Everyone knows how strong your friendship is. Both of you work in the same department, but the way you work is different. That's it. Talk to him face to face tomorrow, everything will be sorted. You are right. I will meet him tomorrow. I am sorry, I behaved too rudely. She can tolerate anyone scolding her, but not you. She didn't even have her dinner. - I know. But I don't like to compromise on my duty. Even Bharat doesn't understand me. Forget it. He must be hurt too. I am not angry with him, Anju. Our thought process and work ethics is quite different from each other but the ones who cage children should be killed in an encounter on the spot but he talks philosophy about the court and the law. A stupid MLA comes to get the kidnapper released and warns us policemen. Should I be silent to all these? No! I can't tolerate all this. It's not a good thing to be soft to criminals. That is a danger to himself. But Abhi, you are not the whole department. Why do you take everything to your heart? If everyone starts to think the same, who is going to save the society and system? I understand. So, let's go somewhere. Let's take a break. Yeah. Sister, I am hungry. Please give me some money. Are you taking a break? Come on, get to work. How much did you earn today? What are you doing here? Get to work! - We were having food. My God! Brother! Sister-in-law! Coffee? - Yes, thanks. Brother, why do you look so dull? What's wrong? He had a fight with Abhi, he went to his house, but he wasn't there, so he is sitting here quietly. - Oh, God! Is that it? Don't worry, Bro. I am there for you. Drama Queen! Abhi's heart melts for his sister very easily. Baby will also be there, she will give a comedy touch to my drama. Then we shall laugh together loudly. Instead of pursuing IAS, pursue a career in story-writing. You're good at it. That reminds me of a tragic incident. - What's that? - Coffee? On the way, I saw few children begging at traffic signals. This is common in our country, to use emotions for business. That's not the point, Brother. Some kids wore eye bandages and some stomach bandages. Some didn't even look like patients. In fact, they didn't look like beggars. Very sad! There's definitely something going on with those children. I have some urgent work, I will see you later. - Brother.. Jai Hind, sir! Sir! - Yadav, get all the files of the missing children cases. Are all the files here? - Yes, sir. Why is the MLA creating pressure and threatening us for a trivial kidnapping case? Do you smell anything fishy? - I have to find out. Listen, get Bunty Yadav to the interrogation room. I will ask you only once, tell me the truth. What do you with the kidnapped children? - We kidnap them only for money. Sir, they won't budge so easily. Should I apply chilli to the cane and put it? - No! I don't break the law. That's why, he is not telling me the truth. He knows that I won't do anything to him and that I have suspended Abhishek too. But Yadav.. - Yes, sir? Which is an ideal place around to carry out an encounter? - Sir, near the ghat. Let me call Abhishek. - Yes, sir. Sir.. - Abhishek, Bunty Yadav.. - I will tell you. Don't call him, I will tell you everything. Camera on. Start talking! We kidnap children and gather them in our backyard. We would kidnap children from schools and parks. We would remove the eyes, kidneys and heart, and sell them in Goa. From there, all the organs were exported to countries like Israel, Brazil, USA, Turkey, China and Mexico. We would then send the children to beg in different cities. Why you.. You don't even deserve to be called as beasts. Tell me everything. I need everyone's names. Rudra Prasad, Karnataka's Home Minister's brother, looks after the business here. I am just a small part of it, please let me go. - Move! Hi! Tell me, Bharat. Hi, Shubhkar! There must be something important that you have called me. Tell me what it is. Do you know anything about the Karnataka Home Minister? Durga Prasad? What do you want to know about him? Hello, Bharat. - Yes, Shubhkar. Did you find anything? Your doubts are true. Under the influence of Durga Prasad his youngest son Adi is running a drugs and weapons smuggling with Dope Manja and Jagan. He has high-level contacts. I've mailed all the evidence. Okay, great! Thank you, buddy. - It's okay. Keep a copy of it with you, for safety. Contact me if you need any information. Bye. Thank you. Jai Hind, sir! - Jai Hind! Neeraj, you and Sharma go to Goa immediately. I've got information that there's an organ trading racket at DP General Hospital. - Okay, sir. Go there in plain clothes and conduct a sting operation. I want to see the hospital's live feed. It's an emergency. - Okay, sir. Neeraj? - Sir. Listen. Can you go inside? - There are a lot of people. Give it a try. - Okay, sir. Sir, this is the cancer patient's report. Please take a look. Oh, my God! What happened? Sir, the ambulance just left. - Okay. Bring the footage to the office. Go that way. - Okay, sir. Dispatch this. - Okay. What, DCP? I expected you to come but not so early... Neither did I expect this. After animals and women, you are not even sparing little kids. It's said that the children are the future of our country but you are using those children for your business. The law won't spare you. So, you will arrest me? - Of course, I will. I have more information about you and your illegal trading more than Google. I have enough evidence to arrest you. - Arrest, you say? Do you know what happened to your friend, IAS Shubhkar Deshpande who provided you with all the evidence you are talking about? You might've killed Shubhkar, but the evidence he collected is still there. Arrest these rascals, Yadav! Raise your hands. What're you looking at? Yadav! Sorry, sir. I got 10 lakhs for every single bullet. The offer was too good to resist. See, Mr. Bharatraj. I know that you are an honest officer. I also know that you won't return the evidence so easily. Everyone has a weakness, so do you. Do you want to see? Look. Rachu! Rachu, are you okay? Bharat, nothing has happened to me. I will never be an obstruction to your duty, Bharat. Don't worry about me. - No, Rachu! I won't let anything happen to you. Bloody cowards! How could you use a woman for this? Bharat.. - If you have the guts, face me! Oh, you love your family! Return the evidence and take your family. Bharat, you should never bow down to anyone because of me. Not to... ..anyone! I am sorry. I miss you. No.. No, Rachu! Rachu.. Abhi always said that you won't understand Gandhi's lessons, that Bhagat Singh style is apt for you. IPS officer Baradwaj and two constables have been killed in the line of duty. "O God.." "O God.." "Your merciful sea is limitless.." "O God, Your merciful sea is limitless.." "O God, Your merciful sea is limitless.." "How can one measure its limit.." "How can one measure its limit.." "O God, Your merciful sea is limitless.." "You gave a goat to a wolf, You gave a deer to a lion.." "But You gave a human to a human to hunt.." "You gave a human to a human to hunt.." "You gave a goat to a wolf, You gave a deer to a lion.." "But You gave a human to a human to hunt.." "You gave a human to a human to hunt.." "You gave a drum to a singer, to beat it.." "You gave a drum to a singer, to beat it.." "O God, Your merciful sea is limitless.." "You gave smile to humans, but also made many kinds of smiles.." "You gave a hundred sorrows to haunt a smile.." "You gave a hundred sorrows to haunt a smile.." "You gave a ladder to climb, You gave a snake to bite.." "You haunted death like a shadow, to trap and trip.." "You haunted death like a shadow, to trap and trip.." "O God, Your merciful sea is limitless.." "How can one measure its limit.." "How can one measure its limit.." There are always two choices when you face a problem. One is to give up and another one is to never give up. You should always fight against the injustice. If you fight for justice, you will never be alone. Definitely, Brother. I'm your sister. I'll face all problems in life bravely. Ammu! Ammu, what the heck! - Brother.. Here, have some water. Ammu, what do you think you were doing? Are we dead to you? If death solved all problems, no one would be alive in this world. Bharat and Rachna had decided that they don't want a baby and treated you like one. If you do something like this, will their souls rest in peace? Bharat was not only your brother, he was my best friend. I am hurt as much as you are. I won't spare the ones who are behind Bharat and Rachna's murder. This is a brother's promise to his sister. I am sorry, Brother. I am sorry. I just can't believe that Bharat died in a gang war. I was an orphan but it was Bharat's father who raised me like his own son. Just like he wanted, we both worked hard to get through IPS exams and became police officers. Though our work ethics were different, our goal was one. Four people went for the raid, correct? - Yes, sir. Barath and two officers died. Only you survived. You're very lucky. - It's god's grace, sir. God graces you more than others. That's why you bought a flat in your wife's name, worth 50 lakh. What're you saying, sir? I am... - Yadav, I know everything. It's because of people like you who have ruined the reputation of the department. The people are losing trust on the police. I can kill you with a snap of my fingers. I will give you two options. First one! If I kill you, that will be known as an encounter and you will lose your reputation and your family will be shattered. - No, sir.. Second one... If you shoot yourself, you will be honoured for sacrificing your life on duty your wife will be respected and also a job for your son. The choice is yours. - Sir.. If the revolver turns towards me you'll stop breathing before you can lift a finger. The death of DCP Bharatraj wasn't a suicide but a planned murder. - Yes, I know. If they mess with the police we should show them how we are going to hit back. Sir, if you permit me I will collect the proof and evidence about Durgaprasad's illegal activities. We'll go undercover but I need a special team for that. Go ahead, Abhishek. But be careful. I will discuss this with PMO and do what I can. - Thank you, sir. Thanks a lot. Sir, Abhishek.. - How could you not know that he was an undercover officer? What kind of a stupid commissioner are you? - Sir.. Dad, you have promoted the wastrels with a star and a badge! Sorry, sir. That was what the motive of his mission. You don't have to say it when we already know. Shubhkar had hidden the proof and evidence. Has Abhishek got a hold of them? We don't know that, sir. Abhishek is a very dangerous person. Killing people in an encounter is as easy for him as putting his signature. Have you come to sing praises about him? - No, sir. He has come only to target you. Home Secretary Raghunandan is the one who has appointed Abhishek, sir. - Raghunandan? Hello? - You used to work under politicians, but seems like you have started playing politics. You kept your tongue in cheek when you were a DC in our state but how dare you target me with your police force! Withdraw Abhishek from this case right now. You know who I am and what I am capable of. I am left with only six months of service, do whatever you can. I don't care. But remember one thing, Abhishek is not a silent officer, but a violent one. Such threats won't affect him. Get out! Where did Adi go at a time like this? Call him. - Sir, his phone is not reachable since a month. Try again. - Okay, sir. Sir, it's ringing. Hello? Adi! Adi! Sir, look over there! Adi! Sir.. - Dad! Sir, it's the same number again. Who are you? Who killed my son? Hey, are you wondering why we have kidnapped you? Idiot, it's not you who has got me kidnapped, but I got kidnapped myself. This is a small game of cat and mouse played by my brother and I. Not everyone can see death. Look over there, kid. Hey, who are you? - Why do you care? Knowing it or not knowing it is not going to avoid your death. When we love someone a lot in our family do you realise how it hurts when we lose them, Durgaprasad? Hey, how do you know about us? - Bihar! DCP Bharatraj. I am the sister of DCP Bharatraj. Don't fly too high. Did you already forget how we killed your brother? How can I forget? The proof of that is your son's dead body! My brother Abhishek Bhargav is Lord of Death for the likes of you. Before you blink an eye, he will confront you as your death. Come on, kid. Let's continue the party in the jail. "Attaboy, attaboy.." "The officially unofficial king is here.." "Head, head, head, head.. To behead the wild heads.." "Here comes the son of a lion.." "Wake up, wake up.." "Run away, run away.." "Don't come in the way, you will get beaten up.." "If you confuse him, you will get beaten up more.." "He has come to close all the cases.." "If he targets, people will die in masses.." "Be careful, big boss.. The warrior is coming for you.." "Chill, chill, Chote Miyan.. The raw warrior is here.." I was the one who brought contracts to rowdyism. I took this part-time job out of boredom. "Attaboy, attaboy.." "The officially unofficial king is here.." "Head, head, head, head.. To behead the wild heads.." "Here comes the son of a lion.." "Wake up, wake up.." "Run away, run away.." "Brother, his power is immenese.." "The earth moves by an inch.." "Go hide yourselves, the storm wearing a proud moustache is approaching.." "Once he comes, you have no option but to get caught.." "He's too clever to be hoodwinked.. No hideout is safe.." "Everyone shudders with fear when he becomes a hunter.." "Attaboy, attaboy.." "The officially unofficial king is here.." "Head, head, head, head.. To behead the wild heads.." "Here comes the son of a lion.." "Wake up, wake up.." "Run away, run away.." Hello, Mr. Abhishek! The last time, it was only you who was talking you didn't even give me a chance to talk. Does it hurt? Is it funny? Laugh out loud. Laugh as much as you want before you start crying. I laugh even when I have to cry. Then why wouldn't I laugh now? Just like my friend Bharatraj dreamed, your business is shut down legally and you lost your status too. The law must have snatched my minister status and business but it can't do anything to me. I had given you a deadline of four days for you to surrender. But there is a saying in Hindi that means that punishment cravers do not understand talks. You need finishing touches, I will give it to you. Shall we see who gives it and who takes it? Brother! Abhi, what's this nonsese? Are all of them bad boys? - Yes. Kids should stay away from violence, I will wait for you outside for five minutes. I won't wait more than that, come soon. Okay? - Okay. Come here. Hey, kill them! Brother! If anyone of you believes that you are a man, touch one person in my family either you will die or your belief will. Let's go, come on. You are in a cage, so you can only bark like a caged dog. Kid, do you know who the king of jungle is? Look into my eyes. Lion! Lion is a lion if you keep it in a cage or in the forest. Arjun! Arjun! Durgaprasad, how did you like the final touch? Only finishing touch is remaining. I will give it to you. Before you kill someone you should check if he has the strength to leave the body. Neither am I Bharat to forgive you nor do you deserve to apologise to me. I don't feel like kicking you since you are so old. Why do you need all this when you are counting your last days? Abhishek. No compromise! Decision on the spot! Ammu? Shoot! Hey, no.. Listen to me..
