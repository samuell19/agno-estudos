Come on, Doc. You staying down here? Yeah. Check this out. Prints right here. We're reporting to you live from the New north-side home. Of Dr. Richard Kimble. A respected vascular surgeon at Chicago Memorial Hospital. Details are sketchy At this hour. But we understand Dr. Kimble's wife, Helen, was found murdered in the home this evening. Right now, Area Six detectives are bringing out Dr. Kimble. We assume that they're going to be taking him to a police station, probably Area Six at belmar and western Where they hope he would be able to shed some light on what happened here this evening. Now, as I indicated, she was found shortly before midnight. We know that she made apparently a 911 call to police. Indicating that there was an intruder in the house. Or that she was being assaulted. Details indicated are very sketchy. We do know that he and his wife Helen. Were at a fund raiser at the Four Seasons Hotel earlier this evening. A fund-raiser for the Children's Research Fund.

I only remember his name because he died last summer. Oh, my God. Richard! Ohh! What are you doing here? Hi, Kath. Have a look. What do you think? Cold normal. Clearly not the same tissue. And not only did they all come from healthy livers. They all came from the same liver. Kath, you beauty. Excuse me. Mr. Roosevelt? Yes. I am Deputy Biggs, this is Deputy Newman. We're United States marshals. Just need a little information about a Dr. Lentz who used to be on staff here. I just want to know. If he knew or ever have any contact with a Dr. Richard Kimble? I haven't seen Dr. Kimble. That's not what I asked sir. Well, I wouldn't know. Now, if you gentlemen would excuse me, I have some prior obligations to attend to. Mr. Roosevelt Yes. I think you're lying to us. You think Lentz is the bad guy? Yeah, why not? He was one of the original patent holders on RDU-90. I was sending him my tissue samples. He was replacing them with healthy samples, issuing the path reports on them. Shit-canning my stuff. Piece of cake. Wait a minute. Lentz died August 21st. Half of the samples he approved were signed the day he died. You're kidding. Someone else must have been manipulating this. Someone with access. Thanks, Kath. Where're you going? To see a friend. This is giving me a headache. It is a very surprising revelation young man. Where did Mr. Roosevelt say the good Doctor was going? Sam, he says he doesn't know. Where Kimble was going. You believe him? Yes, I believe him. He says he was here to pick up some tissue samples. What? Yeah, for a drug study. But listen, get this. The release was approved by Dr. Charles Nichols. Nichols also knew Lentz. Who-aw! He was Lentz's boss. That means he was covering for Kimble. Yeah, Send the C.P.D. over there right now. Noah We're gonna send you a bunch of cops. I want you to make sure they turn that place inside out. You got it. Don't let them give any shit about your ponytail either. I won't. Well done young man. My pleasure, Sir. Henry! Dr. Nichols lied to me. Go find him. I'm on it. OK, he's gone by now. No. Look! I looked there. I looked every place you told me to look and I didn't see him. I'm telling you. He is not in the Hospital. If he was in the hospital, I would have found him. So, what do you want me to do? Hold on. Wait a minute. I marked him. Oh! I got him now. Dr. Alexander Lentz. A noted pathologist at Chicago Memorial Hospital. Was on his way to his daily tennis match. When an unidentified vehicle. Swung around a curve. Slammed his body into the barriers that separate the Drive from Lake Michigan. Yuck! Sam! Sam! You're not gonna believe this.
