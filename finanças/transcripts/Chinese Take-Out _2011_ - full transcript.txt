Look, the box says it contains 350 screws. Of course I count them! Why wouldn't I? The box says 350! Why do I care if the machine sometimes spits out a few more and other times a few less? I always get less! Tell your boss to stop busting my balls. Either he gives me what's missing or I never buy from him again! Period! Goddamn thieves! Scammers, they're all scammers. Screw 'em! All right. 100 grams of long headless nails... - Anything else? - Nothing else. $5. - Excuse me... How do you know? - How do I know what? That it's 100 grams... You're right, I made a mistake. It's $5. - Bye. - Bye. - Hi, Roberto. - How's it going? - Your Internet order arrived. - Oh. Why don't you get a computer? No. I need it once a year so I'll use yours. The Friday magazine with the movie. My sister-in-law, Mari, is back in town for a few days. You know... I've been thinking... It might do you good to have a... - Bye. - Bye. Happy birthday, Mom... I hope you like it. How do I know it's 100 grams, you imbecile? Because I always give extra. How do I know you're an imbecile? Because you look like an imbecile. Look at the fried eggs and chips I'm treating myself to, with real potatoes, not that frozen crap consumed by imbeciles like you... This one is a bit more expensive, but this one melts when it heats up. And if you have to change the bulb, you won't be able to unscrew it. Trust me: Spend a little more and take this one, it's much better. Will you excuse me a second? Be right back. - Hello, Mari... - Hello, Roberto, it's been a long time. - When did you get here? - Yesterday... - Didn't Leonel tell you? - Oh, yeah, he said you were here. You never answered my letter. I wrote you a letter about 6 months ago... No, no, I never got it... You never got it? How strange... Anyway, if you didn't get it, you didn't get it. - Did you have a good trip? - Yes... Very good. I'm with a customer... Sorry, I have to go back in. - Good to see you, excuse me. - Good to see you too... - Bye. - Bye. Dear Roberto: "During the three hour bus ride to my village... not a minute passed without me thinking of you. It"s true, I hardly know you, but as soon as I saw you at my sister's house, I felt l'd known you all my life. Maybe because there are two things I notice very quickly in people: Integrity and suffering and you have them both. My mother collected things from around the world. I never knew her. But my old man used to tell me. He even kept the ashtrays from the time they both smoked. - Oh, Roberto. - What? What? The bed, the bed, there. Not there, that's my father's room. Roberto... screw me now. And since everything has a meaning I can't stop wondering why you have gone so far away after having been so close to me. Here's your order. Nails -sizes-point-five, one, and one and a half, saw blades, small padlocks, and one box with big padlocks. This box of screws is a gift, to compensate for the shortfall from before. Yes, a gift... And this is also for you. - The boss wants you to have it. - Let's see... It's a set of drill bits. - They're English. - No, thanks. - But it's a gift. - No! Thanks. - Hello, sweetheart. - How are you, Gladys? - Fine, and you? - Fine. - It's rather chilly, huh? - A bit. - Bye, honey, till next week. - Bye, thanks. 395... Son of a bitch! He screwed me again! There are six missing... Six or six thousand, it's the same thing. It's the same thing! Fatal Romance: A Hot Rendezvous Goes Terribly wrong.

How are you doing, Roberto? - Hi, Mari, how are you? - Fine. - Leonel sends this. - Oh, thanks. I went out to do some shopping, so he asked me to bring it. Of course, thank you. - Hey, what's that on your face? - Nothing, it's nothing. - Did you hire some help? - No, no, no... It's a chinese kid, staying for a week. That's all. He doesn't speak Spanish, he's lost, I found him in the street, I brought him here... I don't know... He'll stay a week, until his relative shows up, if he ever shows up. Okay, look: Tonight I'm cooking stew... with the works: Zucchini, potatoes, chickpeas, chicken, bone marrow... and I'd love for you to come. Thanks, Mari, but I can't. Because of the kid? Bring him along. Sooner or later you have to eat. Say nine? Is it too late? Nine then. You should have made noodles. He's going to think we're cavemen. Don't look at him like that, you'll make him uncomfortable. He likes it, huh? Why wouldn't he? They're millions of them, they eat whatever they can they're not fussy like you. They're smart. They eat scorpions, snakes, ants. You sure he doesn't understand a word? Nothing. Just chinese. So how do you manage? Gestures... There's not much to say anyway. From living alone to living with a chinaman. You're weird. Look how straight his hair is. They're millenarian. I'd love to have hair like that. This is my house, in the countryside, where I live. See how nice it is? This is my dog, Blackie. Why are you talking to him? He doesn't understand anything, Mari. He understands the pictures. Look, this is Porfirio, the vet who looks after all the animals. This is Olga, my cow, whom I milk myself. She's a very, very good cow... No! I can't show you this one, I look terrible. And here I was laughing at Bebi's joke. Okay. We're leaving. It's late. Roberto! Yes? Don't you want some cake, there's quite a bit left over... No, thanks, Mari. Everything was delicious. Sleep well. Thank you. Damn it! No, no, no! Turn on the light! There's a switch here, see? Turn on the light. Turn on the light, dammit! Screw me! No. No, leave that... come here, come here... Hello... How's life treating you, buddy? - Like shit. - How nice. No, no, put it there. I saw it last night. It's in Russian, with one subtitle every half hour. Can't understand a damn thing. Newspapers. Put them away. But now that you speak chinese, Russian must be a piece of cake. I'm trying to do some accounting And I don't want to screw up. Do you need anything else? - Bye. - Bye bye, bye bye... - Hello, Roberto. - Good morning... Look, I need four more lamp sockets... Okay... Hey, you've hired an employee. No, no, no... - he's... chinese. - Yeah, I see that. My advice: Check his papers, Immigration officers are are snooping around. Hi, Roberto, good morning. Excuse me. Sure. - How are you? - Fine. - Isn't it a beautiful day? - Yes. I know you have to work and I know you're very busy. But I just had an idea. Listen: Your friend is not from here, doesn't know the city. I don't either, so it occurred to me that maybe I could take him around to see the sites... and have a nice day out and about. - What do you say? - Me? - Is it a bad idea? - No, no... Okay, fine, then. - Go get him, so I can take him with me. - Oh, yes, I'm sorry. Come here, come... Take this, come. Here he is. - Hello! - Go. Come, come! I'm taking you sightseeing. No, no, Roberto can't come, he's very busy. You come with me. Don't be afraid. Bye! Hello. Yes. Yes. Speaking. Marcelo who? Yes, yes, he lives here! No, not now, but he lives here. Where are you calling from? From La Plata... Are you his uncle? And where's the uncle? Oh, I understand. Yes, that's my address. Couldn't you come today? Any time. No problem. It's fine, perfect. Give me your number, please. Nine in the morning. No, it's fine with me. Tomorrow morning at 9. Very well. Thank you, thank you very much. Hi. I can't believe I had so much fun without understanding him at all. We went to the Planetarium, we rented bikes... - I found his uncle. - Nooo! They just called from the Embassy. Your uncle. - Ta puo. - Ta puo! Your ta puo. Your uncle. On the phone, just now. - We have to celebrate, Roberto. - Phew... of course. Let's order a meal. My treat if you don't mind. And how did you find him? For the last few days I was pulling strings with the Embassy and making moves in the chinese community and it all came together. This is what I found. They always leave them around. - Anything you can recommend? - I don't know, I never order food... Okay, let's see... chinese food, sounds like a good farewell meal. - What do you think? - Perfect. - Really? - Yes, perfect. Okay... She is going to order chinese food. Food... chinese... For the three of us. Hello, good evening. - Your order. - Thank you. - Here you are. - Thanks. - Keep the change. - Thank you. Do you speak chinese? We have a translator, but only for a minute, he has to hurry back to his job. Say something to him, say hello. Tell him that tomorrow morning at 9 his uncle will come pick him up, in case he didn't understand. He says he's very grateful and would like to know your name. Roberto. With "r" - "Ro-po-po..." - That's good enough. Jun. Jun, yes, the Embassy man told me. It's so interesting I feel I could ask him a thousand questions. Some other day, the food is getting cold. - Okay, that's it. - Yes, of course. Thank you... Please, make sure the door is closed. - He thanks you both very much. - Oh, it's nothing. - Bye, thanks. - Bye, thanks. Let's eat! - What did he say? - I don't know. I took some pictures today. If you don't mind, I'll bring them tomorrow morning before he leaves. By all means, bring them for him. Leonel was gonna print them for me, I hope they come out nice. What a great day. What was great for me was the part when the phone rang and a chinese guy promised to come pick up the "package" tomorrow. - I'm leaving. - I'll go with you. No, stay. I don't want you to watch me stumble home. Bye. See you tomorrow, Mari. For your farewell. This is called "dulce de leche", the most delicious thing in the world. Your people forgot to invent it, so we had to invent it instead. Good, no? - Hello, I'm Marcelo Cheng. - Roberto De Cesare, a pleasure. - This is my wife, Ana. - Pleased to meet you. - And this boy must be the nephew. - Yes, he is! Mr. Qian is quite moved because he thought his nephew had died in an earthquake in china. Oh, I see. And where is Mr. Qian? What's going on? Mr. Qian says this boy is not his nephew and the kid says he's not his uncle. Yes, he is, why not? He is! He is! Tell him to touch him again! Thoroughly! Touch him again! The Embassy must have mistaken the names. - We better go. - Wait, wait... You tell me the old man is alone. The kid is also alone. He doesn't speak Spanish. I don't speak chinese. He's here because I found him in the street, couldn't leave him there. What I'm saying is, just until his real uncle is found, why doesn't he go with you? Same language, same habits. He's clean, reserved, helpful. Roberto, what happened? I'm sorry, Mari. JUN HIO QIAN IS LOOKING FOR HIS UNCLE Good morning, I'd like to see Mr... Excuse me... excuse me, good morning. I know you have over five thousand years of history, and all the patience in the world. But I have to open my hardware store so I can feed myself and the chinese kid that I'm stuck with. I'm holding ticket 46 and want to know where the other 45 people are because there's no one in the waiting area. Would you be so kind as to help me now, please? Twelve time we stalt seeing people. At 12? That's an hour away, that's too long. I need to speak to Mr. Pin Ga Hion Pin Ga Hion... In china fol two month. Can I see his replacement, please? - No one, we have no people. - "We have no people?" Over a billion chinese people in the whole world, and you tell me you don't have enough people. How dare you? Why don't you think of a better excuse if you don't want to help me. I could be dead in two months! I need a solution now! I have a chinaman living in my house, who doesn't speak a word of Spanish. I'm desperate, I don't know what to do any more! I'm all alone, nobody helps me. D'you understand, or don't you, you worthless idiots? Is it so difficult? Hello. 150 grams of washers, do you have them? Scram! Didn't you hear me, ass hole? Beat it! I'm fed up with idiots like you who only exist to piss me off. Out you imbecile! Son of a thousand forsaken whores!!! Come... Is it me who gets breakfast? Of course... come here, come... This is one hell of a mess. It's a huge mess. Yesterday I told you that it had to be cleared up. We have to take all of this out. This goes out, out, to the street. Out, all this. Out. Dammit! Get in! He doesn't speak Spanish. Take him to the chinese district, leave him on the main street. Take this. Bye, thank you. I'm sorry. - Hi. - Hi. I came to bring these photos for Jun. The ones I took the other day. Jun left. - What? His uncle finally showed up? - No. He decided to leave. - Where to? - I don't know... I understand. It must be hard to live with a stranger who doesn't speak your language. Last night I imagined myself in China. Alone. Lost. Without money, unable to speak the language. But then I thought: He's so lucky to have Roberto. And Jun had the tremendous good luck of meeting you. It's hard for me to deal with certain things. I know. That's why you don't give me a chance either. And I speak Spanish. I love you, Roberto. It's as simple as that. You hardly know me, Mari. You're grumpy, a loner... sensitive, kind... and courageous... and you have this look that makes my knees weak. You... are... very kind. How the hell did I get in this mess with you? Just don't get it. - Hello. - Hello. Sorry I'm late... but I could only make it if we delivered your order last. - It's fine. Come in. Come in. You can leave your things there. I asked you to come so I can clear up a few things. Sit down. First of all, tell him I'm very grateful for what he did today. Tell him... he can stay a little while longer. He says he doesn't know how he will repay you for everything. By studying Spanish. I'll pay for the course. As soon as he learns a couple of words, he has to start looking for a job and a place to live. - He says he'll study day and night. - Very good. Let's eat. I'd like to know who he is, what he does, what work he did in China. He's a craftsman... he worked at a plant painting toys by hand. And why did he leave? He had some problems, and since he had no family, he decided to come to Argentina to look for his ta puo. He asks whether you have a family. No, my mother died when I was born and my father died when I was 19. What were his problems in China? He was about to get married when his fiancée passed away. - He'd like to ask you a question. - Yes, sure. What is it you always look for in the newspaper? I like collecting things... I collect stories that are unbelievable, absurd. Why did you start such a collection? My father was an Italian immigrant. Every Sunday he received the Italian newspaper, L'Unitá. On Sunday, April 20th, 1982, L'Unitá published this news. "Argentina is at war with England". He didn't clip it for the headline, which was already totally absurd, but for this photograph. That's me, with a machine gun. The old man left Italy escaping from the war. He didn't know another war was waiting for him here. We fought under very difficult conditions. Eventually, we had to surrender... After that we were held prisoner until they brought us to Buenos Aires and handed us back secretly, like worthless trash. They wanted to fatten us up before sending us home. As if putting back on a few kilos could change what they did to us. By then I couldn't care less. After you've killed one guy, two, three... ten, after you've seen your friends die, you don't care about anything. All I wanted was to come home and hug my old man. When I got home I realized what'd happened. I hadn't had any news from him. The English blockade meant that no news reached us. The last time my father received the newspaper L'Unitá... it had this picture on its front page. He must have been so shocked that he cut it out and pasted it. That same night he went to bed and never woke up. "Your friends" Life is totally absurd, a huge ball of nonsense. Everything I have here, confirms it. For him, everything has meaning. Everything has meaning? Are you sure? All of this... He waited two years for a heart transplant... The operation was a success... when he was being taken home the ambulance got in an accident. His wife, his nurse and the driver were unhurt, the man died instantly. This is full of that stuff. Look at this one, From your country... it's unbelievable. "Fushen Province" cow falls from the sky and unleashes a tragedy. A gang of cattle thieves used a plane to steal animals. A group of armed peasants were waiting for them. Now, what sense does this make? Answer me... what's wrong? Why doesn't he speak? What did he say? What's he saying? Tell me what he's saying! That article was about him. It was his fiancée. No, it can't be! It can't be! It can't be! It can't be! Son of a bitch! You gonna rip me off? Okay, we'll see. Hello? Hello? Who is it? I don't understand. Who is it? Yes, it's me... who gave you my number? The Embassy? Yes, yes, he's here. Are you his uncle? Are you sure? Hold on... where? Mendoza... Mendoza province? I'm sorry, I don't understand. Yes, don't hang up. Don't hang up... wait, wait, please... Jun! Jun! Come, come, come, it's your uncle, your uncle. - Your... ta puo. - Ta puo. Talk to him... Last call for LAN Airlines please board through gate number... - How're you doing? - Okay... I got you several from the provinces and some from Mexico. Is everything all right? - Yes, why? - Nothing. Well, I'm off. Oh, tell Mari that Jun went to Mendoza. He found his uncle. Mari left last night. You're too late. I'll tell her when she calls. I'm home, in case you need... Right... Thanks... "A cow fell from the sky and sank our fishing ship", said the skipper to the media. According to the findings of Russian investigators members of the Russian armed forces stole a couple of cows and put them aboard a plane. However, during the flight the cows became violent and in order to avoid an accident the crew was forced to throw them out of the plane, with such bad luck that one of the cows landed on a Japanese fishing ship which sank to the bottom of the sea. This is the oddest piece of news I have ever presented. Next the news on the economy.
