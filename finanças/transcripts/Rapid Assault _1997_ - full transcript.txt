(MultiCom Jingle) (slow music) - I enjoy dealing with you, Amir. Prompt, efficient. What's the status on the rest of the crates? - Being put on your truck even now. Where's our money, Rynark? - Why so impatient? We're all friends here. - There's no honor among thieves, Rynark. The money, now. (tires squealing) - Take cover! (gunfire) - Rynark, you set us up! - I'd run if I were you. - Bastard. (dramatic music) - Hello, (mumbles). - The hell are you doing here? - Jones just wants me on sight. - You are strictly an observer, you got that? - You're the man. - Oh, shit. - Take care of this. - Left or right? (mumbles) - Hey! (gunfire) - Cover me. (explodes) (screams) (grunts) (explodes) (shouts) (grunts) - Get him! Get him, come on! (shouts) - Damn it! (slow music) (thunder crashing) (door opening) - Good morning, doctors. - Good morning. - Am I interrupting? - No. Not at all. - You seem nervous, Doctor. - You try working with a pistol to your head, see how you behave! I done everything you asked. Release me. - In good time. - The toxin is complete! Damn you. - Careful, Doctor Strichman. We haven't forgotten your attempt to undo everything we've worked for. There'll be no more antitoxins, Doctor. - The bacteria that we've developed is too lethal. You release this thing, millions, perhaps even billions will die. - Precisely. Rynark will want a demonstration. Consider yourself warned. (dramatic music) - Coming up on sea land. We'll be in range in five minutes. - [Rynark] Sea lab, this is Rynark, come in. - [Man] Go ahead, sir. - Send out a mini sub to pick me up. I'm sure you have our coordinates on sonar. - [Man] Roger that. We'll rendezvous in 90 seconds. - Right. Rynark out. Good job, Xavier. Your boys have learned to run this very well. - We're professionals. Sub's a sub. - Keep up the good work and I'll toss you a bonus when US brass pays up. - You think they'll pay? - Unless they want to get the end of the world off to quick start, they'll pay. - This Ventrix virus. Seems like nasty stuff. And what is it exactly supposed to do when it's completed? - It'll make Ebola seem like a dose of the clap. Trust me, when they find out what we have, they'll give us anything we want. - What's the plan? - We plant the virus canister in the abyss off the Azores Plateau. Then we're going to set it to detonate. If they don't give us what we want, do the math. - Mini sub to Rasputin, we're hovering directly above you. Mini sub moving into docking position. Ready for boarding in 10 seconds. Mr. Rynark, the mini sub is docked. - I read you. I'll be there in a minute, stand by. - Somehow I doubt the Americans will just roll over and do what you want. - If they're gonna call my bluff, they'll wish they hadn't. Just keep your eyes and your ears open. Set up the tomahawk missile just in case. And booby trap the trench with an explosive device in case anybody tries to tamper with it. - Right. No point in doing this half-assed. - I guess it's time to get this thing moving. Good luck, Xavier. - I hope we don't need it. - [Radio] Mini sub, Mr. Rynark is on board. - Mr. Rynark's aboard. - [Radio] Clear for separation. - Mini sub departing. Helm? Stand by to alter course. - [Radio] Aye sir. - [Man] I'm sorry, Miss Strichman, I can't find your father. - Not anywhere? - [Man] No, I even checked his laboratory. - Did you check his mailbox? - [Man] He has it stacked full of mail. - This is so weird. This is not like Dad at all. - [Man] Well, I know he's working on a new project. But he didn't give me any details. - Thanks for checking. I'm going to the police. - Well? - That was Dad's neighbor. He hasn't seen Dad in more than two weeks. - Well, that's not unusual, is it? You always said when your dad starts to work on a project, it's days before he sticks his head out. - This is different. There are 12 days worth of mail stuffed in his mailbox. No matter what Dad's doing, he always checks his mail. He's compulsive about it. - So what's next? - The police. - Didn't you say your dad lives in Virginia? - He does. But our cops will have better luck getting the ball rolling than some (mumbles) from Miami. Will you cover for me? I'll be back as soon as I'm done. - Angela Strichman? - Yes. - I've been sent here to bring you to the hospital. - Hospital? - It's your father. - My father? What's happened to him? - He's fallen in with some very bad people. Take her away. (shouting) (sirens) - So what's this all about? - Rynark is impressed with the work you've been doing, my friend. I think he means to promote you. - Do tell. - It's not my concern that your man got caught with the stinger missiles. And once you've taken control, it's your problem. Absolutely not. There is no deposit, there's no return, no refund. It's a pleasure doing business with you. Mr. Pennington. Mr. Pennington, how nice of you to come on such short notice. - No problem at all, Mr. Rynark, sir. It's no problem at all. Actually I'm working on an experiment back in the lab... - This won't take long. You know, you've been an exemplary associate. You're always willing to assist. - You pay me very well, sir. Well, it's my philosophy, that is that I believe that generosity like that, it should be rewarded with hard work and dedication. - I believe you already know the lovely Talia. - I... No. I'd remember you. - Moscow, 1986. You were smuggling dissidents out of Russia? - Bad break for you, Mr. Naval Intelligence Man. - Hey, you got the wrong guy. (gunshot) (shouts) (laughs) - See? Don't insult my intelligence. - I'm not gonna tell you a goddamn thing! - That's where you're wrong. Talia. You and Marco accompany Mr. Pennington below. Be creative with your interrogations. - Get the fuck away from me! I swear to god, I'm not with naval intelligence. (shouts) You can just shove that thing up your ass, bitch. Not telling you a goddamn thing. (shouts) - What is that? Stay right there. - Honey, be careful. - Oh my god. I think he's dead. Come on, we better call the police. (knocks) - Sorry to barge in, sir, but-- - What is it, ensign? - Intelligence has informed us of the loss of Agent Pennington, sir. We received a partial report from him yesterday at-- - But it was cut short, I know. We suspect from jamming at the source. - This morning, Agent Pennington's body was washed up on a beach in Rhode Island. Cause of death wasn't available. - I bet it wasn't pretty. He was a good man. I think it's time that we quit playing cloak and dagger and get serious. Get me James Decker. - Aye, sir. - [James] Ready, Jules? - [Julie] Ready, baby! - Here she comes. Come on, hit it back. Good shot. (phone ringing) - Don't answer it, Jim. - Have to. Hello? - [Man] Is this Commander James Decker? - Yes, it is. - [Man] We have a code red, Mr. Decker. - Yes, sir. - [Man] We need you here ASAP. See you then. - Yes, sir, right away. - Let someone else do this one. - I can't, Jules. - This is getting ridiculous. Every time we try and spend any time together, you get called off on these secret missions. - You knew what it was gonna be like when we got involved. - Well, maybe I want more. - We'll talk about it when I get back. - You assume a lot. I might not be here. - Well, it's your life, Julie. You gotta do what you gotta do. If you're here when I get back, we'll talk. If you're not... You're not. - Act like you don't even care whether I'll be here or not. - I care, Julie. - God damn it, James Decker! - What? - I care more than you'll ever know. - Come here. (kisses) Listen to me. Right now, our country needs me a lot more than you do. Come on, gotta get ready. (dramatic music) - Hello, Doctor. - Never mind that. You promised that I would be released when this project was complete. - Once I'm satisfied with the test results, we'll talk about your departure. Shall we go? - Come on. (mumbles) The germ is an instantly mutating strain. If released, it will infect the host. And that's any host, animal or plant. Anything that that host comes in contact with will also be infected and so on. - It's the ultimate chain reaction. Our money was well spent, my friend. - A test on one of our lab animals will give you some idea of the effect of the germ. - I didn't spend millions on some bioweapon just so I could blow up a bunch of rats. People, Doctor. What will this do to a man? - Rynark, there's no way in the world to know that. (snaps) What the hell do you think you're doing? Let him out of there! - Of course, Doctor, if you would prefer another test subject. Talia! - Angela. - Dad! - Oh, dear god. You son of a bitch. - It's your choice. Angela or your assistant. - Let her go. - No! No! Help me! No! - You rotten bastard! (gunfire) (screams) - Scary. (thuds) - I shouldn't be gone too long, Jules. Okie doke. - So tell me. I wanna know. What does Uncle Sam got that I ain't got? - Nothing. Absolutely nothing. (beeping) - They just can't wait, can they? - It's my job, Julie. I just happen to be good at it. - Yeah, don't patronize me. - Alright. You take care of yourself, kiddo. - That's my line. Go ahead and go. - Hey, Julie? I love you. - I love you too. - Jim, good to see you again, son. - Good to see you, sir. - This is David Phillips with-- - Another agency. - It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Phillips. - Okay, let's hit it. At approximately 08:45 hours this morning, the body of one of our agents, Roger Pennington, washed ashore on the coast of Rhode Island. - What was this Pennington working on, sir? - We'd had him in deep cover for months. He'd infiltrated a terrorist network and he was sending us regular reports on their activities. Mr. Phillips. - The terrorist group is a mixture of former East German Stasi agents. Ex-KGB, GRU officers out of Russia. Maybe a few from other agencies as well. This is their leader, Lars Rynark. - Yeah, I know Rynark. - As you know, they're extremely well-financed and professional. - Pennington's reports have been coming to us from an abandoned undersea research station in the North Atlantic. These terrorists had apparently kidnapped some leading biochemist and were forcing him to develop some sort of bacteriological weapon. - Do we know what this weapon will do? - That's classified information, Decker. Suffice it to say, it makes the Ebola virus look like a sniffle. - Simply put, Jim, we want the station neutralized and the bioweapon recovered before it can be deployed. - Okay, sir. Give me a couple hours, I'll get the team assembled. - That's a negative, Jim. Just you, no platoon. - There's certain sensitive issues here, Mr. Decker. An entire team wouldn't be as discreet as, say, one or two men. - Two. - You and Phillips will rendezvous with U.S.S. Valhalla off the Canadian coast, which will convey you to your target. - Well, let's see here. We got two guys against an army of terrorists. I like them odds, sir. - I'm glad we see things eye to eye. - Damn, sir. You know how much I hate working with outsiders. I don't even know this guy. - I know. But I didn't have any choice. Look, I hear he's a hardass but a straight shooter. He'll back you up when the going gets tough. - He better. I was wondering when Rynark was gonna surface again. - Yeah, he's like a rash that won't go away. Intelligence confirms that he has picked up a diesel sub from the Russians. - Sounds like a lot of people take advantage of that old Soviet yard sale. - Intel reports that he has made some modifications to fire missiles, but we don't think he has any nukes. - You don't think? Well, hell, sir, that makes me feel real safe and secure. Damn. (beeping) - You got it called up? - This is where Rynark's located. It's an old Russian oceanographic research facility about a mile off the Azores Plateau. It uses a hydraulic turbine energy source. They're pumping sea water into the main hull. - That's pretty damn clever. - What's the depth? - About 1,000 feet. - What would you say is our best point of entry? - There's a small turbine intake port here, which is on the west side of the station which may or may not be operational. - One way to find out. So you think that's our best point of entry? - Yeah. - Well, I'll swim over first to secure the vent. Once I'm inside, I will radio for Phillips and he can join the party. Gentlemen, if that's it, I do have a chopper to catch. Admiral. Thank you, sir. - The satellite's coming into range in 20 minutes and the signal interceptor's online and waiting. - Good job. I guess it's time to plant the virus in the abyss. Get them into the mini sub. Rynark to Xavier. - [Xavier] This is Xavier, go ahead. - [Rynark] Captain, we may become very popular with the wrong people so keep your eyes and your ears open. We don't want any surprises. - Don't worry about me, Rynark. You just make sure things run smoothly on your end. - Rynark out. - [Xavier] Control center, this is mini sub. We have separation. On route to the Quintino Abyss. - [Radio] Roger, mini sub. Stay on this channel and keep up informed. - Two minutes to the abyss, going full power. - Good. The sooner we make the drop, the better. - Starting our descent. Control center, this is mini sub. We are two minutes from the abyss. Descending to 1,200 feet. - [Radio] 1,200 feet? Copy, mini sub. - There's an outcropping right below us. We have approached the mouth of the abyss. It's directly ahead of us. - [Radio] Roger, mini sub. Reduce speed and proceed with caution. - Reducing speed. (dramatic music) We've arrived at the designated point. Going to full stop. - Let's do it. Activating mechanical arm. Done deal. - Let's bail, I don't trust that stuff. Control center, mission accomplished. On route back to sea lab. - Hey, Phillips, you're a little green around the gills. Hell, this ain't nothing, man. Should have been at the Desert Storm. That was the real deal. We had to loosen our collar just to shove our guts back down where they belong. - Sorry I missed it. - Oh, by the way. When it's time to hit the sea lab, we're gonna swim over one at a time. - One at a time, why's that? - Because we may only get one past, that's why. See, if Rynark has any men guarding that vent, it's a lot better if just one of us gets his ticket punched. - So if you don't make it, I've gotta find another way in and pull this off without backup. - Damn, Phillips, you catch on quick. - This just gets better all the time. - [James] Command, we've arrived at rendezvous point. - Take us up, Mr. Carter. - Aye aye, sir. Prepare to surface. - [Announcer] Attention all hands, we have arrived at the dropoff. Report to your stations immediately. - Any sign of them yet? - Negative. - [Radio] There, gentlemen. We have visual contact. (mumbles) - Thanks, Chief. - The chopper's directly above us, sir. - Helicopter 59, we have you in sight. We're ready to receive. Over. - [Radio] Roger, Valhalla. We're on final approach. We'll be dropping the SEAL team off your starboard bow. Repeat, starboard bow. - Roger that. - [Pilot] The winds are high now. I'll hold her steady till you're clear. - Go, Phillips. Thanks for the ride, boys. - Good luck, sir. - See you next time. - [John] Captain, the SEAL team is in the starboard hatch. - Release the hatch. - [John] The SEAL team is on board, Captain. - [Captain] Mr. Carter, come with me. - Permission to board, sir? - Permission granted, welcome aboard. I'm Captain Will Reilly. This is my XO, John Carter. - Sir. - I assume you gentlemen would like to dry off and change clothing. - Yes sir, that's affirmative. - You can use my quarters for the duration of your journey. - Thank you very much, we appreciate it. - Right then. If you'll follow me, gentlemen. - We just got the signal. It's him, sir. - Rynark? - Yes sir. - Son of a bitch. - [Rynark] Admiral Harriman, nice of you to join us. - What the hell do you want, Rynark? - Very simple, really. Your keys to Washington D.C. - You're a lunatic. - Lunatic with the means to destroy the ecological balance of the planet, so I suggest you show me some respect. - We're listening. - $50,000,000 transferred to a Swiss bank account numbered 012457899. You got four hours. - Rynark, that's impossible. We can't arrange that kind of transfer in that amount of time. - I suggest you try very hard. Let me spell it out for you. I have a canister full of the deadliest biochemical agent known to man set to detonate at my command. - You're bluffing. - No, he isn't. - Good call, Harriman. Gentlemen, get off your asses. I'll be in touch. - What should we do? Evacuate the cities? - What cities? We don't know where he's planning to hit. - Valhalla will travel along this course to the depth of 1,000 feet. Slide through this canyon to about half a mile from the undersea lab. Pop the hatch. You'll swim over to the lab and get in any way you can. - Roger that, sir. Now the old blueprints that I checked out show that there's a turbine engine intake port on the west side of the station. So if they're still in operation, we can shut her down and use it as our point of entry. - We'll fall back to a secure position and await your signal that the mission accomplished. You have three hours. No signals in that time, then we come in blasting with a full nuclear strike. Any questions? - No sir. Let's get her under way. - And that's it. Mr. Carter, take us to 1,000 feet. - 1,000 feet, aye sir. Attention all hands, prepare to dive. Prepare to dive. Dive officer, prepare to blow the ballast tank. - Aye sir. - [John] First tier ballast tank's full. 15 degrees on the down angle. - [Dive Officer] 15 degrees, aye sir. - Oh, and Phillips? There might be something you wanna do just before you go on that dive. - Oh yeah, what's that? - Pull that steel rod out of your ass, you'll swim faster. Feel better too. - Captain, we have a Los Angeles class nuclear sub heading our way. Bearing 316, mark 212. - Helm, set an intercept course. - Aye sir. - Rynark. It's Xavier. We have an American class nuclear submarine headed our way. - Do what you can to slow them down. - Right. - Intercepting range eight minutes, sir. (dramatic music) - [Xavier] Range to contact. - [Man] 4,000 meters. - Change heading to 379. All ahead full. - All ahead full, sir. - [Captain] All stop. - [John] All stop. - Let the forward lock. - Letting forward lock, aye sir. We've arrived at the drop off point. Gentlemen, stand by to disembark. - Look, Decker, I don't mean to be such a hardass. Sometimes I just get carried away. - Oh, that's okay. But you know, most people respond better when you don't act like a jerk. I do. - Duly noted. - Dive got you nervous as hell, don't it? - Why, do I look nervous? - Like a stripper in a convent. You'll be fine. Ready to go? - Let's go for a swim. - What, are you gonna watch me eat? Why am I surprised? - You behave or else. (grunts) - [John] Forward lock is flooded, sir. - Mr. Johnson, release the forward lock. - [Johnson] Aye sir. - He's away. Keep your fingers crossed. He's almost there. - Scuba team, we've got a single blip on scope. Looks like a biological. Send a couple guys to check it out. - Damn it, he's got company. Made it. - [James] This is Decker. I'm in. Go ahead and send pretty boy over. Tell him I'll meet him at the ventilation intake. - Good luck, Mr. Phillips. Have a nice swim. - Thank you, Captain. - [John] Mr. Phillips is away, sir. - Pull ahead full. - Aye sir. All ahead full. Five degrees on the down angle. - Come on, we can get by that, come on. - [Rynark] Attention, guards. Intruder alert, intruder alert. Seal off the perimeter immediately. - Captain has the conn. - What have you got? - Contact 120. Russian attack class boats, sir. - [Captain] Heading? - Straight for us, sir. - Sound collision. Full reverse. - Full reverse. Aye aye sir. We're at full stop, sir. - Battle stations, battle stations. All hands to battle stations. Repeat, battle stations. - There they are. Stand by. Let's stare 'em down a while. - Sonar, what are they doing? - Just sitting there, sir. - Are their tube doors open? - Negative. - Cool bastards, aren't they? Weaps, conn. Load torpedo tubes one and two. - [Man] Load two, one and two, aye sir. - 44 up the sleeve beats four aces every time, huh? (dramatic music) - Hey, they're over here! (gunfire) - Shit! (shouts) - You alright, Phillips? - Yeah. - Alright, go lead the way. - Huh? - Go, go, go. (bangs) - We could make back all the money we ever spent setting this whole thing up. - 10 times over. All we have to do is salvage the-- - If this was just about making money, I would agree with you. But those bastards are gonna pay for what they did to us. - If we're gonna get even with everybody who ever hired us and then put a price on our heads when the job was through, we'd have to wipe out half the nations of the world. - 3/4. Why quibble over a billion or so here and there? - But Lars, if we wipe out one or two nations to show them we're serious and then offer the toxin to other countries... - At incredibly inflated prices. - Absolutely. We could stand to make billions of dollars. Revenge earns us nothing. - Revenge is its own reward! The toxin stays in the abyss where we left it. The timer's already set. I see no reason to alter a perfectly good plan. - I wonder why there hasn't been any word from the Rasputin. - Because Captain Xavier will inform us when he's toasted our US Navy pals. - What about Strichman's daughter? - We should kill her. I mean, she's no good to us now that her father's dead. - I agree. Nothing but trouble at this point. - Fine. Take care of her. Two bullets in the back of the head, be done with it. Don't get cute. - Alright, the lab's this way. Watch your back. (ominous music) Wait. Go, go. (grunts) (ominous music) (grunts) - She's loose. - What? - The quack's (mumbles). She's gone. She killed her guard, she slipped out the air shaft. - What a pain in the ass. Find Marco. Search the station from stem to stern. Find her, boot her ass out the airlock. - At least. - Clear. - This lab isn't even close to where it was supposed to be. - They've obviously moved things around. Expected someone like us to come and rain on the parade. - [David] Wonder where the hell they are. - Think a better question would be where the hell did they hide that virus? - [Captain] What are they doing? - Just sitting there, sir. - Nerves of ice water. - We should strike decisively, sir. Engage the contact, then destroy the base. - We gave them three hours, Commander. They get their three hours, not a minute less. - Sir. - That's all, Commander. Keep your mind on the task at hand or destroying the base'll be a moot point. - Aye sir. - Which one of us is gonna blink first? (footsteps) (grunts) - Let's try that again, sweetheart. - You better kill me, you sons of bitches. - Questions first there, sweetheart. Where's the virus? - Look up your ass. - Oh (mumbles). I'm gonna ask you one more time. Where is the virus? - Who the hell are you? - We're the good guys. Now what's your story? - They were keeping me hostage. - Sure. - Yeah, you'll forgive us if we don't believe that. - Well then shoot me and shut the fuck up. - Sounds good to me. - Hey. - You're really here to stop them? - Yeah, that was our plan. Now what's your name? - Angela Strichman. - Okay, Angela Strichman. Why don't you bring us up to speed? - Marco! I've been combing this whole station looking for you. Girl's escaped. - How long? - Long enough. You take the west side of the station, I'll take the east. - Amateur. - So you're telling me that this virus shit is your father's work. - They kidnapped him and they made him do it. And then they killed him. - So what are you doing here? - I went looking for my dad. Next thing I knew, I wake up on a mini sub and they bring me to this flea pit. - Okay, let's get back to the virus here for a minute. You have any idea what it'll do to the marine life? - Only a guess. He was working on a theory of mutating chain reactions. If he was successful... - You got any idea where they keep this virus? - Yes. I overheard the terrorists talking about it. They dropped it in an abyss and they set it to detonate. - You have any idea when the timer's set for? - No. And I didn't hear which abyss it's in either. - The Quintino Abyss is the closest to this place. That's where I think it is. - That's pretty deep. Definitely too deep to dive. - Phillips, who said anything about diving? Miss Strichman here said she was brought here in a mini sub, is that correct? - Yes. - You remember where it's docked? - I'm pretty sure. - Alright. I'll go down in the mini sub, you stay here at the base with Strichman until I get back. Strichman, why don't you lead the way? Careful with that sharp knife. - Gentlemen, I don't see any movement. I'm not a patient man. Looks like you need some persuasion. - Damn it, we need more time to get the money together. - I guess you sent the rapid assault force to bring me that message. - I don't know what you're talking about. - You are all so far behind me it's not even fun to play. Evidently you need an object lesson. - Object lesson? - I guess I forgot to tell you I have a tomahawk missile locked and loaded. I think it's time to launch it. What do you think? New York City maybe. - New York? - Wait a minute. Give us a chance. - You had your chance. Rasputin, Rynark. Captain Xavier, come in. - Xavier here, go ahead. - Launch the tomahawk missile immediately. Coordinates, New York City. - Roger that. Open missile bay doors. - Missile bay doors open, Captain. Missile selected. - Fire. - [Man] Missiles away, sir. - [Man] Captain, someone's fired a missile. - Type and status? - Not sure. Target is the mainland. - Impact capacity? - Unknown at present, Captain. - Get me the Pentagon. - Aye sir. (phone rings) - Get me Commodore Nash aboard the Saratoga right now. - [Nash] Nash here, sir. - Commodore, an enemy has launched a missile, target heading New York City. Intercept and destroy. - We're on it, Admiral. Attention all personal, prepare for aircraft launch. This is not a drill. Repeat, this is not a drill. (beeping) - [Blue Leader] Red Leader, this is Blue Leader. No visual contact yet. Switching to tactical view. Still no contact, Red Leader. Just a second. Radar contact confirmed. We've got the bogey bearing 316 mark four, closing fast. - [Red Leader] Copy, Blue Leader. - [Blue Leader] Maneuvering intercept. We're on direct intercept course. Air to air missiles armed. Weapons systems online. Engaging coordinates. Maintain speed and course. - Bogey's 10 seconds from the coast line. Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. The bogey has entered New York airspace. - [Red Leader] We have a lock on bogey. Missiles armed. Missiles away. (explodes) Missile intercepted, sir. Bogey's been aborted. Bag and tag, we're heading home. (sighs) (laughs) - Thank god. - Nice shooting, gentlemen, but now you know I'm playing for keeps. I hope you have some body bags ready for your special forces team. - Is this guy Decker as good as you say he is? - For all our sakes, I hope he's even better. - Rynark to Rasputin. - [Xavier] Go ahead. - Captain, I'm tired of this game. Blow 'em to hell. - Roger that. Waiting's over. Status? Weapons officer. - Torpedo tube loaded and flooded. Awaiting your orders to open outer doors. - And they're still not moving? - Correct, sir. - Contact status, Mr. Carter. - [John] Steady as a rock, no sign of aggression. - That son of a bitch is waiting us out, hoping to lull us. - (mumbles) a firing solution. Stand by to open the outer doors. - Stand by to blow all tanks. - Firing solution ready, sir. - Open outer doors and fire at will. - Aye sir. Opening outer doors. - [John] Contact's doors opening, Captain. - Blow the tanks. - Sir, they're blowing their tanks. Detecting a rock slide directly above us. (alarm blaring) - Sir, the pressure has caused an avalanche! - Get us out of here. All ahead full. - Enemy's moving out, sir. - Belay that firing order. Get us out of this damn trench. All ahead full. - All ahead full, sir. - Lucky bastard. - This way. - You sure? - Yes, I'm sure. - There they are! (gunfire) - Get down. (grunts) Get the hell out of here now, move it! Hold it right there! Put your hands up and turn around slow. (gunfire) - [Man] Coming free of the trench, sir. - Bring us around. Set course and speed to match contact. Set firing solution. Shove 'em right up. - Where are they? - [John] Bearing 183, closing at 20 knots. - Take us down to 1,500 feet. - 1,500 feet, aye sir. 20 degrees on the down angle. - 20 degrees, aye. (ominous music) - Freeze. I'll take that. (grunts) (screams) - Stupid idiot. - Enemy contact dead ahead, sir. We're in their wake. - Not lose me with such a schoolboy trick. Firing solution! - Captain, they're in our wake. - Stand by, counter measures. Prepare to release a full spread. - Standing by, aye sir. - Firing solution ready, sir. - Fire! - Torpedoes in water. They're active and have (mumbles). - Launch countermeasures. - Countermeasures launched. - What time is torpedo impact? - 20 seconds. - All ahead flank. - But Captain, the mountain range directly ahead. - You have your orders. All ahead flank. - All ahead flank. - All ahead flank, aye sir. - Countdown to torpedo impact? - 15 seconds. - Impact time to mountain range? - 20 seconds. - Sound collision. - Torpedo impact in 10 seconds. Nine, eight, seven. Five, four... - Left full rudder. Reverse port engine. - Two. - Aye aye sir. - One. Impact. - Torpedoes missed, sir. - Damn it! - Bring us around, Mr. Carter. All ahead full. - Aye sir. All ahead full. - One, two, three. Alright, let's get this show on the road. - This way. - [James] Valhalla, this is Decker, over. - This is Reilly. Go ahead, Mr. Decker. - [James] They stashed the virus in the abyss. I'm in the mini sub now as we speak. I'm going to retrieve it. - Copy. Bring it aboard the Valhalla as soon as you have it. - Aye sir. Decker out. - Sorry, must be the change in pressure. - I don't feel it. I just think you're in lousy shape. - I'm in great shape. - You're no SEAL. You act like a company man. - Good guess. Maybe you know a little something after all. - Not enough to know that you shouldn't flap your mouth so close to an air vent. I know there are more of you. Why don't you do me a big favor and tell me how many and where they are? - There's one more. He's in one of your mini subs heading for the abyss. - Phillips, you son of a bitch. - That's right, I am a son of a bitch. I've been with their team from the very beginning. You weren't going to just let me die with all the others, were you, Rynark? - I knew you'd make it back here somehow. Couldn't risk the company tracking your transfer sheet. - Am I supposed to take your word for that? - What choice have you got? Get her out of here. - You bastard! - That's right, sweetheart. Just wanna make sure I'll be around to spend the money. - Who's the other guy? - I think you know him. Navy SEAL named Jim Decker. - Decker? Beautiful. Well, if Mr. Decker enters the trench, he'll trigger our explosive device, he'll find himself buried under 15 tons of rock. And that couldn't be better. (beeping) (ominous music) - Bingo. (alarm blaring) Oh shit. Shit. - [Computer] Warning, hull damage. Warning, hull damage. - Enemy contact has turned, sir. - Flood torpedo tubes three and four. - Tubes three and four flooding, aye aye sir. - Open doors. - Doors opening. Torpedoes ready, sir. - Fire. - Incoming torpedoes. They're active and homing. - Affirmative, torpedoes in water. Range, 500 yards and closing. - Launch countermeasures. - Aye aye sir. - 300 yards and closing. - Countermeasures away. - 100 yards, still closing. First torpedo's going after the countermeasures. Brace for impact. Second torpedo is still active, sir. - 50 yards and closing. - Full reverse. - Too late, sir, they have a lock on us. - Oh shit. (explodes) - Impact confirmed. Direct hit, Captain! (cheers) - Set course for the sea lab. Take us back to our original holding position. - Here we go. That's it, there we go. Okay, there we go, that's got her. Damn. Where are you, where's that goddamn canister? There you are, you bastard. All stop. Alright, how do you handle this grappling hook? Okay. Damn it. One more time. Got you, you son of a bitch. Alright, where's that autopilot? Autopilot on. (ticking) Cool. Time to spare. Valhalla, this is Decker, over. - Go ahead, Mr. Decker. - Yes sir, I've secured the canister and in route to the Valhalla. ETA will be approximately... Stand by, sir. Got a warning light on the fuel pressure gauge, she's dropping fast. - Will you make it to the Valhalla? - That's a negative, sir. But maybe I just might be able to make her back to the sea lab. - Understood, but the schedule still holds, so keep track of time. - Roger that, sir. Soon as I get there, we'll bail. - Decker. Where the hell have you been? I was wondering what happened to you. Jesus Christ, you got it. - Good guess. Where's Angela? - We got caught. I was able to slip the leash. - Well, let's go get her. - Forget her, I think she's already dead. - Well, what do you mean you think? - It's only a matter of time anyway. - Hands at your side, Deck. - That's a good trick. Careful. - Long time no see. - Not long enough. How's that jaw? - Oh, it's healed quite nicely, thank you, even though I had to eat through a straw for six weeks. - Figured you'd be the one to sell us out there. So why didn't you just kill me? Why you have to play all these schoolboy games? - Timing was never right. Then that bitch got into it. Would have blown my cover. - You always could screw up a perfectly good plan, Deck. But not anymore. Settle these debts. - Even if that sub didn't radio our position to the base, they're bound to be considered overdue and possibly in trouble. - What do you want me to do, Mr. Carter? Nuke the lab and kill our men just on a hunch? - It's our only option, sir. - We still owe Decker's team 15 minutes. By god, they'll get every one of them. Is that clear? - Aye sir. - [Rynark] Talia, Talia, come in. - Hello? - Change of plans. Meet me at docking port one in five minutes. - Understood, Talia out. - It's been a lot of fun, Decker. See ya. (grunts) - Phillips, it has been fun but I sure wouldn't wanna be ya. (clatters) - You're not screwing me out of this one, Decker. This is gonna be good. (beeps) Sorry, toots. Elvis is leaving the building. (dramatic music) (bubbling) - Decker! Look out for Phillips. He's been in with the terrorists the whole time. - Not anymore. What about the mini sub, is it still here? - It's already gone. - Damn it. And the Valhalla's gonna be here any minute. - The Valhalla? - That's the attack sub that's gonna nuke this place and us along with it unless we get the hell out of here. - Typical. Any ideas? - Yeah, maybe. (bubbling) (beeps) - [Captain] Range to undersea lab. - 10 kilometers. - Stand by for the release of nuclear weapons. - Does the XO concur? - XO concurs. - Aye sir. Activating launch code sequence. Launch code sequence complete. Standing by, sir. - Load warhead equipped torpedoes in bays three and four. - Aye sir, strike torpedoes in bays three and four. - 90 seconds to optimum firing range, Captain. - Stand by, XO. Wait for my mark. - Here, put this on. - What, we're gonna swim for it? Yeah right. - Yeah right. Got some tanks of (mumbles) hanging outside. Now hurry up and put the goddamn suit on. - Well, do you mind? - There's no time for modesty. Just put it on. (bubbling) - Optimal firing range in 65 seconds, sir. - Zip me. (beeps) Hurry up, let's go, come on. - [Man] Torpedo doors are open, sir. - 40 seconds, sir. - Insert keys. Turn key. Now. - Fire control online and standing by, Captain. - Time, Mr. Carter? - 30 seconds, sir. - Stand by. Fire on my mark. - 20 seconds, sir. - Stand by for weapons release. (knocks) Jesus. Did those bastards buy the whole Russian fleet? Sonar, conn. Report, mister, where is it? - They're right on top of us, Captain. - How the hell? (knocks) - They're tapping on our hull with Morse code. - Morse code? - Translating. (knocks) It's Mr. Decker, sir. - Decker? - He's requesting permission for emergency boarding. - Bring that man aboard. - This way. (beeps) - Countdown to fire, Mr. Carter. - Optimal firing range in nine, eight, seven, six, five, four... - Did you retrieve the substance, Mr. Decker? - That's a negative, sir. May fire at will. - Optimum range, Captain. - Light 'em up, weaps. - [Man] Aye sir. Nukes away. (bubbles) (beeps) - Time to impact 15 seconds, sir. 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, nine. Five, four, three, two, one. Zero. Impact. (explodes) Dual direct hit, Captain. (cheers) - Nice shooting, Captain. - A team effort, Mr. Decker. Any sign of virus contamination? - That's a negative, sir. The sea water's clean. - Get us out of here, Mr. Carter. Maximum speed. - Right full rudder, reverse starboard engine, bearing 266 mark. - Contact, Captain. Small and fast. Moving away at high speed. - Captain, I think you better throw another shrimp on the barbie. I think that's tonight's big door prize. - Come again? - Lars Rynark. Big time bad guy. - Understood. Weaps, load torpedo tube one, standard payload. - Standard payload, aye sir. - Sir, could we hail him? - Communications. Get that squirrely little shit on the line. - Aye sir, scanning frequencies. - Rynark. Rynark, this is Decker speaking. - Decker, you're a lucky son of a bitch. We'll meet again and when we do... - There won't be a next time. And this time I wanna do a little more than bust your jaw. I'm gonna send a torpedo right up your ass. - Wait a minute, Decker, you can't do this! Decker! Decker, listen to me, Decker! - With your permission, sir. - Granted. - Weaps, fire at will. - Firing with pleasure, sir. Torpedoes away. - Bitch! - Sayonara, asshole. - No! (explodes) - Job well done, people. Take us up, Mr. Carter. - Surfacing, aye sir. Officer, prepare to surface. 15 degrees on the angle. - 15 degrees, aye sir. - William Reilly. - Angela Strichman. - Pleasure to have you aboard ma'am. Whatever happened to Phillips? - I happened to Phillips. - Phillips was in on it from the start. - Phillips? - Yes. He was rotten to the core. He had to get off the mainland before his fellow scumbags blew the virus. - Son of a bitch used us for a taxi. - Well, Decker, we've waxed and stacked the bad guys and their underwater happy kingdom and it's not even dinnertime. - And the Army thinks it gets a lot done in a day's time. - [Angela] What's next? - Home. I'm going home. Good job. - If you'd like to change and dry off, you're welcome to use my cabin. - Lead the way. (sighs) Been one hell of a day. - Well, hey. - God, I missed you. (kisses) (laughs) - Wasn't sure you'd still be here. - I thought about it but I love you, Jim. And all this is a part of you. So I gotta love it too. (beeps) Not again. Did you hear anything? - Not me. Not a thing. - Neither did I. (dramatic music) (MultiCom Jingle)
