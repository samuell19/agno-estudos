I screwed up. Somewhere along the line I went wrong... ...by starting a family... ...by writing books... ...stopping smoking. I have almost no rapport with my wife and two children. We're living together... ... but like strangers in the same hotel... ...but making an effort to ignore the situation. I'm 48 years old. I'm not doing anything. I don't sleep much... At night I tell myself that any light would be better than this darkness. Thomas! If that's for me, take a message please and say I'll call back. I'm so late! I can't, anyway. I'm eating. Is no one answering that? Yes, hello... How are you? I was in the garden, that's why. No, it's just my early morning voice. No, it's coming along fine. Not always the same. And where are you, Paul? Ah, did you come down? See you soon. Sitting on this chair I wrote 12 crummy books. I feel like I've lost all those years. They taught me nothing... ...but how to keep quiet, live alone... ...and sit. I have cholesterol... triglycerides... ...and I'm losing my hair. When I see my face I think of my youth... ...and what I have become. Hello. You're awake? No. It's not shut! Aren't you late? No, but I'm not going. There's a strike. - What's it about this time? - Same as usual. Why did you get up so early? I'm going to Eric's place. Is there any more salted butter? This it? Yeah. Anyone seen my dental floss? Hello. Hello Thomas. - What? - Have you seen my dental floss? Mum? No dear, I haven't seen it. But I only used it last night. I left it on the shelf in the bathroom. It's not there now. It's crazy that it just disappears. I wonder what that guy was thinking when he painted that. Maybe he was alone for a long time. Or his wife was leaving him. You look tired. I slept badly. I'll finish my first bands today. Oh good... today! Yes, it's today. It must be exciting putting bands on teeth. Why? Isn't doing nothing all day better? I couldn't bear it. It's only temporary. Stop always saying it's temporary. He's been like that for months. - Can I drop you off? - No thanks, Thibault's picking me up. Do you know who'll be the president of the jury at the end of the year? - No. - It's Munthe. Well, is that good? Of course that's good. I dreamed of an only son and I had two idiots. I did well to avoid these breakfasts over all those years. Watching them evolve every morning makes me feel uncomfortable. Like wearing a woollen pullover on your bare skin. Are you doing Thursday now? Yes, from this week. To earn a bit extra? No, it's because I'm needed. What are you doing today? Don't know. The garden is getting worse and worse. Can you drop me at the clinic? Yes. Why? You sick? No, just a problem with one ear. - Is it inflamed? - I don't think so. You should have told me. I would have arranged it. I've made an appointment. I didn't want to bother you. - What time? - Now. In 15 minutes. Who are you seeing? Ansen... Or Fransen or something. Janssen. - Have a good reputation? - I wouldn't know. I hardly know him. She's a good liar. She lies calmly... serenely.. She lies in the way I'd like to live. I have to go to the office. You're on the 2nd floor. See you later. Don't worry about your ear. Eh? - You call me if there's a problem. - Okay, goodbye doctor. There he is. It's him. He's my wife's lover. I don't know anything about him. I've never seen him before. I don't want to consult him. Mr Polaris. I don't know why, but I feel he'll disappoint me. How can I help? I get dizzy spells... ...and a buzzing in my left ear. Are you related to Anna Polaris the speech therapist? She's my wife. - Did she suggest you see me? - No... No, I didn't discuss my problem with her. OK... and have you experienced this for a long time? Not very long, but when it occurs, it's very unpleasant. It's persistent. We'll take a look. Make yourself comfortable. "The ghosts were not covered with white sheets..." "The ghosts were not covered with white sheets..." "The ghosts were not covered with white sheets." "...as we sometimes imagine." "...as we sometimes imagine." "as we sometimes imagine." "The strings fluttered at the slightest gust of wind." Why doesn't he confess the truth, now? I'm ready to hear everything. We could talk to each other, discuss it calmly, explain ourselves. If he did, I think I'd shake his hand. And then I'd go home. Well, everything works fine. I don't see anything untoward. The examination showed everything to be quite normal, Mr. Polaris. Do you think I'm imagining it? That I'm hearing things that aren't there? Oh no, I'm not suggesting that. But I'm sure it's only a temporary discomfort. I'd say it's quite harmless. If you want I can measure the conduction velocity of your auditory nerve. I don't think that's necessary. I'll come back if it continues. Very well... As you wish. What do I owe you? On the house. Because of my wife? Oh no! I'd prefer to pay. Otherwise we'd both be in a slightly awkward situation. No? You don't think so? There's nothing wrong with him. Absolutely nothing. On the other hand, he knows about us. What makes you think that? Well, he's never been dizzy. He hears perfectly well. He did not come to consult me. He came to provoke me. I felt it. I felt him watching me throughout the consultation. If he suspected, he would've told me. I know him. No. You seem very sure of yourself. Oh, but I am! But what if he really does know? So he'll know his wife has a lover. I've already explained our relationship is no problem. He wouldn't care. He doesn't care about anything. You've nothing to fear. Come here! Come on! Forgive me, but I'm not in the mood for that. Nah! You know I don't like you smoking in my office. It's still very odd that he came to see me, don't you think? Hello? Forgive me, I'm sorry. Will you just stop always apologising!? It's just that this thing has got me worked up. So, what do you want? Are you seeing someone? No. Want to come up? Eh? To do what? You know very well what for. How about it? Anna! Anna, do you hear me? You want me to come down... Is that it? Answer me, Anna! Very well, I'll hang up. I'm hanging up. - Doctor... - Yes? - Your car? - Yes. - Very nice. - Thank you. Really. If you'll excuse me, I have to... You wouldn't be going into town? Yes. Do you mind dropping me off? - Of course. - Thank you. Oh... leather upholstery! - 4-wheel drive? - Yes, continuous. Can you put your seat-belt on? What's beeping? Your seat-belt. Would you put it on? No, I never use them. I don't like them. Hydraulic suspension. It goes up! This is an English car, isn't it? Yes, it's English. You have no problem with spare parts? You wouldn't find them everywhere. - At Rover, though. - Oh, of course, at Rover. Powerful engine? V-8... 4.6 litres. The thing that sets a car like this apart, is the comfort. Sure. What's that little noise? What noise? We have to talk, see each other. This business really hurts me. You don't want me to arrange something? I'm here 3 or 4 days, not on vacation... On purpose, because it bothers me. I write to him... he doesn't reply. I'm not used to such a relationship. I don't care about the contract. If he doesn't do a book this year, it'll be next year. No big deal. But I want to see him. I'd like to at least understand. I'd like that, too. What about you? Keeping busy? You OK? Me? I teach people with speech loss. I help stutterers. I treat dyslexics. I see people. And outside work? Do you have someone? Oh no, Paul! What? There's no-one. Thanks very much for the lift. My pleasure. Oh, that's great! - No? - Yes, of course. What it for? It's to hold drinks. Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must... Yes, I understand. Do you ever let your wife drive your car? - I do, yes. - Do you trust her? Well, I don't know why, but I can't. I wonder what his wife looks like. It's weird... ...but over time my wife started looking like my father. Luckily, it's very pleasant here. They say we'll have this weather all week. How long since we've been out? What did we do last time? Yes, we stayed inside. Oh oh...! Come along... Let's try and avoid that. I saw Paul this afternoon. He'd like to see you. He worries about you. Thomas was invited to dinner with the idiot who was invited here the other night. What idiot? The one who believes that Pasteur invented rabies. How was your consultation? Very good. Not very nice, but very good. Did he find anything? No, nothing. - Did you make yourself known? - Yes. - Was I wrong? - No, on the contrary. I wanted to pay him... I thought you'd be more comfortable like that. No? Didn't he call you before I left? - Why would he call me? - I don't know... - To let you know. - He was only diagnosing a patient. I thought that there would be an easy-going situation between colleagues. No. I must have been 9 or 10... I was with my father. I don't remember where we were going. To my aunt's, maybe. We often went to my aunt's place. In any case, it was holidays. Christmas I think. It was raining heavily. I remember, there was a van that was driving very fast. I didn't know what was going on when my father slammed the door. It hurt my ears. I found myself outside. I was cold. I was soaked. For the first time in my life, I saw the face of a dead person. That's it. I'm finished. You still have five minutes left. I'm finished with these sessions. I'm finished with the therapy. And you think it's the right time for that? Yes. I've found a better way. Which is...? I bought a revolver and some bullets. Why did you tell me that? Don't know. I just felt like saying it. What do you want me to do with this information? Nothing. I just think they're a lot more useful. Maybe I'm not the therapist you need. You could see a colleague of mine. No. That makes it your hour. I propose we do a final session next week and look at your decision together, calmly. Can I ask you a question? Yes. Something has intrigued me for a while. Your left hand permanently in your pants pocket. What's it mean? In your opinion...? I don't know. I'm asking you. You're really getting everything off your mind today, Mr Polaris. It intrigues me. It's been intriguing me for months. I'm afraid the explanation will disappoint you. No matter... I'm used to that. Alright, as you wish. Seven or eight years ago... ...in Montreal, Canada... ...on the occasion of a psychiatry congress... ...I was walking back to my hotel... ...when I saw in the window of an antique shop... ...a display of watches. I've never had a particular interest in watchmaking. I still don't know why I pushed open the door of that shop. Anyway... ...in my perusal of this display... ...my eyes are attracted by a watch... ...made in the '60s... ...by Hamilton. A real curiosity. I asked the dealer if I might examine it more closely... ...and I see that something is engraved on the steel case. "Do you know what you're holding?" the dealer says. "This is an historic item." "The watch that President John Fitzgerald Kennedy was wearing..." "...when he was assassinated in Dallas.." This watch was given to Kennedy in 1962, for his birthday. It's not known who gave him this gift. But it's thought that it was a family member... ...since it was given at Hyannis Port, the seaside resort in Massachusetts... ...where the Kennedys had their country-house. On November 22, 1963, when he boarded the plane that took him to Dallas... ...he was wearing the Hamilton on his wrist. When the shots rang out on M Street... ...he was still wearing it. At the hospital, as soon as he arrives at the operating theatre... Probably to reduce the chance of infection... ...a nurse removed the watch and put it on a trolley. Until the death of the president, and when his body left the building... ...nobody pays attention to the Hamilton. It is only when clearing away the surgical instruments... ...that the nurse saw that the watch was still where she'd put it. So, without thinking, she took it... ...slipped it into her pocket... and went home to watch the news on TV. That woman's name was Andy McMurry. She was the antique dealer's elder sister. Many years later, she asks her brother to repair the winder on the Hamilton. And that night at a restaurant she told him the whole story. That's how the Kennedy watch ended up at this shop. And during all those years no one wanted to buy it? It wasn't for sale. What changed his mind? To take advantage of the time that he had left, he told me. Of course I wondered if the guy was conning me. If he's just made the whole thing up. - So? - I still wonder. Nevertheless, since then, the Hamilton has not left me. And since I'm afraid of losing it, I never wear it on my wrist. I hold it permanently in my left hand. At the bottom of my pants pocket. And Oswald's watch? Where's Oswald's watch? Who recovered it? Who's wearing it? I know what I want to do... Search his pocket... find this watch... ...and put it on my wrist. Are you asleep? Nope. - What are you doing? - Nothing. - Didn't you go out? - Yes. This morning. - Well, I've had a very bad day. You know we're lucky to live here. Yeah, that's what my father said. I bought dental floss for Alice. Those kids bug me. Me, the kids, the whole world seems to bug you. Maybe. Do you want me? Nope. Could you get information about Kennedy with that? Kennedy? I'd like to get pictures or tapes about the Dallas assassination in '63. Yes, you'd have to look, but it must be possible. Is it for work? Are you going to write about Kennedy? Yesterday it was cold... ...and today... ...there's pressure where I feel pain. Kennedy couldn't cope with toothache. And Oswald? Maybe that's what drove him crazy... Toothache. That story's so bizarre. If there's nothing in his pocket... But I believe it... I want to believe it. I love this place... Right? You were right about Simon. Well, I was sure. I felt it. I told you it wasn't normal for him to come and see me like that. Did he speak to you about it? No, but looking for something in his office, I came across a revolver. I don't believe it! Bullets as well. Oh... for heaven's sake! I don't understand what he's up to. What do we do? Must do something. I don't know. We can't just wait for something to happen. Do you realise what could happen?! What's to stop him coming to the clinic, and... You've got to talk to him and tell him that... ...explain to him that... that we are not... Not what? No, but I mean, really, it's silly... Our affair, it's rather... Where will it lead to, Anna? What are you going to do? Dunno. I don't think we should see each other for a bit. We can call each other. Eh? Saying things over the phone would be better, eh? Agree? You're not at the clinic? No, I was waiting. I saw the revolver. I was looking for a light. I happened to open the drawer. I didn't sleep a wink. What's the gun for? I bought it ages ago. What for? Excuse me, I have toothache. Why did you buy a gun? I don't know. You don't buy a gun without a good reason. - I wanted to. - Why did you want to? Don't we have any aspirin? I need an explanation, Simon. Explain what? I bought a gun and bullets. That's all. I won't stop asking, till you tell me why. To defend myself. Against who? Against me. Dad, I managed to get you an appointment with Munthe. His secretary said you have to be there at 10 tomorrow and he'll squeeze you in. Okay? Lucky, eh? Why didn't you tell me before, and I could've got you something. And you know dentists, especially specialists like Munthe... They hate seeing people unexpectedly. He'll tell you. Don't bother with him, Alice. He doesn't care anyway. He never listens. I'm going over to Eric's. Don't you have classes tomorrow? It's OK. Don't worry. I won't be late. That door will fall off one day. Gurney called again. Why don't you want to see him? Why would I want to? You could negotiate a new contract. Freer... without deadlines. I am free. I've no deadline. What are you doing? I don't get what you're doing. I'm looking at you three. That's an occupation. Do you think you'd be better without us? How old is Simon? 48. In the United States they call it the mid-life crisis. What? A crisis in the middle of your life. You can become depressed when you reach 40 or 50... When you realize that the time you have left... ...is perhaps a little shorter and less interesting than what you've had already. There's more to it, but that's the general idea. Do you believe it? I don't know, but the Americans buy it. Why don't you leave...? Get some fresh air? I thought about it... but I don't want to. I don't want to leave. It'll pass. Yes, it'll pass. Perhaps he'll write us a very good book. No, that's a stupid thing to say. I'd like to know how many of you have been in a gym program... ...have become discouraged, and stopped. Look at that...! Practically everyone. Yes, it's easy to get discouraged if you do not get a quick result... But for good results... That tooth must have been troubling you for a long time. But you ignored it and waited for the last moment like everyone else. Earlier, I could have proceeded differently... But now I have no choice, but to operate. Incise the gums... ...curette the cyst, close with 2 or 3 stitches. This is the price of negligence, dear sir. Nurse... anaesthetic. - Gently! - Yes, gently. Swelling doesn't matter. It can happen after an operation like this. Careful! I'm annoyed about your stitches. They can't stay like that. When I called Munthe, he seemed less worried than you. Good? He advised me, via his secretary, to go see someone else. I'm not surprised. He has a huge clientele. He'd be overwhelmed. His fees are also huge, but he's respected because... Just wait till your stitches are out. The job was out of the ordinary, that's all. But for the stitches, he's right, you can get anyone to do it. I'll see another dentist, and I'll tell him... "My dentist told me to see a second-rater to do this little job..." "He was too busy." Oh, don't take that attitude! Yes, I shall. It's the way I see it. Thibault? You don't say! I should never have had children. As time goes by, I realize more and more that I've nothing in common with them. Anna manages to allay suspicion. Especially with Alice. As for me, I don't even want to allay suspicion. It's good. A bit cold, but good. It means I can eat it without it hurting. I had surgery on a cyst. Terrible. By a so-called specialist. In fact... just a butcher. Don't know why I'm so tired today. Pooped. You and I make a hell of a team, eh?! I made you laugh! What'll we do now? Watch a movie? Anna, Anna... So... Did you talk to him? Doctor... they're looking for you everywhere. Thank you. I waited all day yesterday for your phone call. What did he say? Did he talk about me? Anna... What are you doing here? Answer me! Tell me what happened! What are you playing at? Robert... Not right now, sorry... I haven't time. We couldn't find you. There are 3 patients. Mrs Lazil left. She was furious. Well, now, here I am. Shall I call her and make a new appointment? Who? - Mrs Lazil. - Oh yes... as you wish. You want me to beg... Is that it? Listen, I have two operations shortly. Two larynxes, including cancer. I can't operate! Look at my hands! Anna... please wait! Leave me alone! - You're hurting me! - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. But this situation is upsetting me. Anna, answer me now please. You've nothing to worry about, okay? Truly? Yes. Are you sure? You talked about it? I've reassured you. Can you get out now? I've missed you so... Please... no! I was afraid. Stop it! Stop! Darling... come on! No! What made you go to the beach in the middle of your job? I don't know... it was lunch-time... I saw my beach-bag. I just wanted to. - But the water was ice-cold, right? - It was freezing. That didn't deter you? Are we going to go on about it all evening? I just wanted to. You have to be aware of your age doing that. What's my age got to do with it? That's how Thibault's father died in any case. - Didn't he drown? - Yes. He sank like a stone. Poor Thibault was traumatized and wouldn't get on the boat again. - That feeling any better? - Not really. - He was unlucky with you. - That's for sure. I've a hole in my jaw, my gum's fucked. Yes, he was really unlucky with me. What I mean is, it can happen with the best of them. And it was a last minute decision to go to him, also. That's Thibault! Pass me the ice-cream please, Thomas. This is Thibault. Good evening. Mum... Thomas, my brother. And my father. Pleased to meet you. - Sit down. - Thank you. - Have you eaten? - Oh yes. Like some raspberry ice cream? No thanks... I've just had dinner. - A coffee then? - No thanks, never at night. A herbal tea? A small one? That'd be nice, if you have some. OK? One herbal tea. You OK? "I'm pretty worthless, I don't believe in anything, yet I get up every morning." That's one of your expressions, isn't it? Yes, that's an expression of mine. I think it's one of the last sentences in the book. Yes, it is. I haven't read the rest yet. When I pick up a new book, I have to look at the last lines first. It's stupid. You've read the essential bit. Anyway, you have a fascinating job. I've had a bit of a block just lately. Yes, Alice told me. You go in circles. Did she tell you that I was catching flies too? No, but you look as if you'd be quick with your hands. I train a lot. It stimulates the mind. Would you like to try it? I don't really think so. You should. At your age you'd progress very quickly. Are you in pain? You have a problem with healing. Is that right? Yes, it can be very painful there. But not threatening. The only risk in that kind of surgery is damage the maxillary sinus. But not with Munthe. That'd be virtually impossible. Here... may I...? Here... don't move. Yes, I can see you are certainly at the acute stage. You had to get stitches out? Yeah... good. Apart from disinfecting, there's nothing to do. You'll need to wait one or two weeks for it to heal. I believe you have a boat? Do you go out in it a lot? Very little. You get seasick? No... it's just that I have some bad memories. Really? It's true the sea can be dangerous. For example, this afternoon, my wife... ...went swimming in the surf. It was very cold. A simple cramp, and she'd sink like a stone. Why did he say that? I don't think he appreciated having his gums examined. But he's a dentist, he's interested. Where's the harm? - It's just not done. - What does "not done" mean? Lifting his lip to see? He's not a horse. - You're both completely sick. - Where is Simon? I don't know. He just left. I know. But it's useless, I assure you. You have to make an appointment. It's your boss who put me in this condition. So tell him that I shan't move until he sees me. Tell him that with the excessive fees he charges, he needs to be conciliatory. Who needs to be conciliatory? - So it's you who's making a scene? - I'm not. I'm just waiting my turn. But it's useless, Mr Polaris. I'm not seeing you. Last time, I saw you at short notice, purely as a courtesy to your daughter. Now you're the nice man acting as if that was par for the course. Just cut out this condescending tone! I'm not nice, and you'll please stop talking to me as if I were a 4-year old. It was a botched operation... My gum's completely ruined. So now you'll try to finish the job properly. Understood? Firstly, that's unwarranted. Secondly, get out! On your way! You're starting to give me the shits! I hate vulgar people, Mr Polaris. So get out of here and never come back again! Scram! You bastard! I'll throw you out! If you still have trouble, don't hesitate to call me... Inspector Lagasch... s-c-h. The victim has filed a complaint. I imagine that a lawsuit will be launched. Really? It's inevitable. What does he do? He wouldn't tell me. - He writes books. - Oh, that's why. You know very well the guy is very important to me... ...and you attack him like some wild beast, because he has no time to see you? Couldn't you have seen him another time? Why are you like this? Why do you never respond, when I talk to you? She's probably justified in blaming me for all this. What she doesn't know at this moment is... ...despite her cries and anger... ...I can't hear her. I listen to the sound of rain... ...and I think of the ticking of a watch. Good evening, how are you? No, he's gone out. No, it's true, I assure you. Okay, well, I'll tell him. Yep... yep.... thank you. Goodbye, Paul. It was Gurney. He insists. What are you reading at the moment? The menu. Alright... and other than that? Nothing. You're not reading any more? You know, if you want to start writing again... Oh, no. I don't want to start writing again. So what are you going to do then? Gentlemen... Madam... Would you like to order? What's "roulades de soles, sauce Vermeer"? These are stuffed paupiettes of sole fillets with garden vegetables... ...served with a lightly seasoned Dutch mousseline. What's it to do with Vermeer? The sauce, Sir... Dutch. I'll have an entree... Give me the skate with capers. - Madame? - I'll have the same. Are the oysters good? I'll take a dozen... and the lobster afterwards. I'll leave you the wine list. Enjoy your meal. - No thanks. - You're not smoking any more? - Not for 6 months. - Good for you. How about an article on tobacco? But I've stopped writing. It's a shame because most writers who quit smoking do something on it. It's a fact. Do you remember that guy we published...? 68,000 copies for his divorce from tobacco. His first book. However, he didn't benefit for long from his success. 3 months after publication, he had a stroke. There was a fly there. Have you noticed how guys who start having success often develop diseases. I'm safe then. No, seriously. It's still weird anyway. It has something to do with guilt, all that. A sort of Judeo-Christian spasm. Excuse me for a second. Do you re-educate guys who have had a stroke? No? It must take some time to recover. It'd be a risk recovering on your own. - He's left. - Sorry? I'd say Simon has gone. - Gone where? - Just gone off. What did I say? I said something? No, you didn't say anything special. Well, he won't eat then. - The skate! - He wouldn't care about the skate. You know what his main preoccupation is right now? He catches flies. That, I certainly don't understand. Paul or Thibault... it's the same. It's all about what it will cost them. So what? Why not? Is it a crime to do a job, and want to make a living? It's not a crime, but it disgusts me. I'm fed up with this show. I won't applaud. I listen to these people, they're all alike. They're pathetic. Does that make me pathetic? What do you look for in people? I'm not following you, Simon. Just how far can you go on like this? You find your children tedious. After 22 years do you find out you need to educate them differently? What do you finish up with? Say something! Do you think I enjoy seeing a guy your age spending his days catching flies? Playing with revolvers? Scorning his kids? I'd like to watch TV... Leave me alone. I do that. Everybody does that. We leave you alone, Simon. We want to get close to you. You go out of your way to create a void around you. - You'll finish up alone. - Do you want to leave? End up alone? That doesn't scare me. On the contrary. To be a new man... Someone to whom life offers a second chance. Get away from the concerns and reproaches of others. No responsibility for others. Be free from guilt. Sleep alone. Do your shopping. Live with the door open. And wait. Mr Polaris! I would like to see the watch. - That's all? - Yes, it is. Yes, I'd engrave my name on the case. No date, only my name. The watch-band is fragile. I wouldn't change it. I'd keep it. Sir... Did you call for roadside-assistance? Yes. I'm the mechanic. What's happened? I tried to start it... Many times. It won't start. Would that be the smell of petrol? Yeah. Smells like you've flooded everything. You pumped like crazy on the accelerator. - Well, it wouldn't start. - Yeah, well you flooded the engine. Always the same. Well... come on, we'll take it to the workshop. Really? You can't fix it here? I don't have my tools. Why? Don't you have tools in your truck? They never leave the garage. You never leave with them? - Never. - Why? I don't like being watched when I work. Since you're not doing it on the spot, I'd rather you take it to my usual garage. You still need to buckle up. No, I don't buckle up. We're there. I always feel good with you. I feel at peace, I'm calm. Like with my father. Don't you have two daughters? Of course. They live up north. It's a long way to come to see you. My children live at home. One day they'll leave, and I won't even notice. So in the end... ...distances... are relative. We should both start smoking again, eh? Peaceful... Nice and comfortable... with a cigarette. Did you see the way the swallows flew low today? They're after flies. Know what we'll do... Wait for the storm. Both of us... Side by side... Peacefully. - Good evening, Anna. - Good evening. You want dinner here? I don't know. If that's OK... Gladly, yes. Mum... I've something to tell you. Yes? Thibault and I have decided to get engaged. Really? Yes. That's wonderful. But I'm... When? - Fixed a date? - Pretty soon. At the end of the week, actually. And Thibault thought it'd be a good idea if we had it on the boat. And then, if the weather was nice, we could go for a little boat trip. It'd also coincide with the 2nd anniversary of my father's disappearance. There will only be Thibault's family, you and some friends, that's all. Great! Set the table, Thomas. I can do it. What did Thibault mean, about his father's disappearance? Well, he meant it was an opportunity. He wants to reunite his whole family... ..and reunite with the boat. At the same time have a thought for his father. I think it'd make him very happy. Oh yes. Well... I congratulate you, Thibault, I really do. Anna, can I tell you something? Yes. It seems to me you smoke a lot. You should be careful... You know that after a certain age it's irreversible. Listen Thibault, I'll not smoke in your home because obviously tobacco disturbs you. But in this house I do what I like, okay? - He's only thinking of you, Mum. - I'm quite aware. So, are you dining with us? I only took the liberty because there's a slight hiss in your bronchi. Please forget about my bronchi, and give me a hand instead. - Are you sure you want to stay to dinner? - Certainly! An engagement is bad enough, but with a memorial added...! - Aren't you going to bed? - No. I've things to do in the basement. At this time of night? I'm going to clear stuff out. I'm going to move my office. I'll set it up in the basement. What's this all about? I don't know... I'd just like a change. But it's too dark to see properly. Why bury yourself down there? I want to. Tomorrow I'll put a table down here. Some storage cabinets. It'll work out fine. Are you really going to set yourself up here? Yep! You're getting more and more complicated... To know. When you've lived with a woman for more than 20 years... ...you end up knowing more about her... ...than you realise. I'm pressed against her... I'm touching her body... I can feel that Anna wants something that's not far from the Hamilton. Simply one moment that's better than the rest. All she is asking for is simply a little respite. I know what I'm to say. - Did we have an appointment? - No. I'm afraid I can't see you today. It won't take long. Come in, but make it quick. I'm expecting a patient. I'd like to have another look at... ...the watch. Mr Polaris, I must ask you to leave the couch. I just want to look at it. You have to stop this childish behaviour. I shan't leave. I want it. I need that watch. You're getting nothing. Nothing at all. And in future I insist you make an appointment. You don't seem to understand what I'm saying to you. It's not some hare-brained idea, or fantasy. This Hamilton is very important to me. I know you understand what I mean. I know very well that the story is maybe just an analyst's artifice. But I don't care. I want to buy it. Whatever you want for it. That watch is in my pocket... and it's going to stay there. Now, would you please... - I'm early. - I just finished. - What was it? - The coil. Wasn't working. We've replaced just about everything on this car. Saves me buying a new car. You sound like your father, with his old DS. He never wanted to let it go. When he came, he'd be looking at the new models... ...the inside, the engine... And then he always said the same thing to my father and me... He said, "Progress is the terminus of heritage". My father said that? Word for word each time. And your father... Are things better? No, they're not. In the evening after closing, I go to the hospital. He asks me how things are... if it was a good day. I tell him about the customers he knows. When I see him starting to tire, I leave. - You go every night? - Yes, every night. He likes me to bring him photos of the work area each day. And then? I parked 2 or 3 cars in front of the door, so he could see things were going well. It must have pleased him. Well the picture's on his bedside table. When you see him tonight, give him my regards. Tonight I'll talk to him about your coil. How are things at home with you? My daughter is getting married to a dentist. Well, at least it's a clean-hands job. - Oh, you think so? - Well, they always wear gloves now. Like thieves... No fingerprints. - You'll mail me the bill? - Sure. Bit of blue smoke there. Just showing her age. Do you know what Thibault's father was? Lifeguard? - No, seriously. - I don't know. Periodontist. Is that trade contagious? It's true that it's good here. Can I smoke in your office? Do what you want. Thibault's going to throw flowers into the sea. Tomorrow? In memory. - I knew you'd like it. - What a farce. Mum, where are the breadcrumbs? I'm coming! What is he making up there? A surprise for dinner. They must stop with their surprises. Come on, let's go. It's alright. We've got time. It's amazing how much food they're taking. They like to be sure they have enough. - What's that flag? - What flag? - The one up there. - It's the Panamanian flag. They really are taking everything. You could identify the Panama flag? No, but Alice told me that the boat had been registered there. Panama?! Please behave today... Don't start anything! No, but it's still... Panama! We're going to be late. Let's go! - Come on. - Feel like a cigarette? Are you back on them? No. Come on. My dear friends... First of all I would like to thank you for being here. Since the disappearance of my husband, this is the first time the boat will go to sea. And I know that from where he is, Raphael is watching us... ...listening to us... ...and shares our emotions... ...on this day of the betrothal of Alice and our son Thibault. And now, let the celebration begin! Come on, boys... champagne! Bravo, it was beautiful. Very moving. To our friendship. Here's to the happiness of both of you kids. Long may you live! Maybe a little soon, son. Not too soon... We'll wait a little bit. Depends what you mean by "soon". Hi, I'm Benito Grimaldi. You can call me Benny. I was Raphael's best friend. He was an exceptional man. You have a lovely girl. I heard she was starting her orthodontic studies. Excellent speciality... very fashionable. To rectify the teeth in time, dare I say... ...is to cure the root of evil. Tell me, Mr Polaris, you write, I believe... Novels, no doubt? Very interesting. Unfortunately, given the state of mouths these days, I don't have much time to read. As the English proverb goes... I don't understand. What don't you understand, Mr Polaris? Your maxim... in the context. You'd know that a proverb doesn't have to explain itself. A proverb is like a shade of colour... Some perceive it, others do not. I don't know what you're talking about. More's the pity. What a warm day! Did Thibault show you round our "Dondi"? Yes, it's a beautiful boat. My husband completely restored it. Raphael was like that. He always knew exactly what he wanted. Did he sail a lot? How does a periodontist get to sail? Never had time. No, this boat was a madness, a passion, a dream. A dream that led him to the bottom of the sea. Do you sail? Do you have a boat here? Oh no. We don't have a boat. I think you're sensible. I don't know any happy yachtsmen. Too many taxes, too many storms, and above all, too much water, ...as Benny says. Precisely, what does this "water everywhere" mean? You don't speak English? - Mum... whenever you're ready. - The flowers are here? - All ready. - Perfect! Let's cast off and set sail! Raphael, we've made this trip on this sailboat you loved... ...to tell you that we haven't forgotten you. And despite the weather, despite the swell... ...you remain... Oh shit! You remain right now... You remain right now in all our memories... ...and our lives. Your son... ...who, by the way, looks more and more like you... ...is now ready to follow in your footsteps. When he starts, we'll tell him, let me tell you... ...that we are all with him, to advise him... ...and help him grow to the heights that you had reached. Raphael... may God keep you forever by His side. - Did he fall? - Did he jump? Do you want me to fetch the wreath? He's sick in the head. I'm fed up with it! - Calm down, Alice. - No! He's sick. He needs treatment. What he did was disgusting. He's crazy! How can anyone do something like that...? Showing people he despises them! Alice! Agree it was a special ceremony, anyway. It was a tribute to his father, that's all. - A bit theatrical though. - Your husband wasn't theatrical?! I'll leave you two to have fun together. Are you looking for Mr Sabundi? He's not here any more. He passed away 4 days ago. Peacefully... without suffering. I was here four days ago. Yes, the day of the storm. When you left, I took him back... ...and he seemed quite happy. It was really good what you did for him. I never got the opportunity to tell you... ...but we lack people like you. Thank you, Mr Polaris. Have you met any of the other residents? No. Come, at this time they're almost all here. - Come if you want. - No, not today. Not today. I came to get the watch. Please. I have a patient waiting for me. Your last patient left 5 minutes ago. It's 1 o'clock. You're going to lunch. I won't keep you. I just want to take what belongs to me. You've got a rather fanciful notion of property. Alright, give me the watch. Hello, Doctor. - Hello, Doctor. - Goodbye, folks. I don't know if this is the right place for that. What are you doing? Trying to stay calm, Mr Polaris. Aren't you going to shoot me? Do you realize what it's like to shoot someone? The noise, the smell of powder, the look on the victim... ...his body suddenly collapsing... ...and the particular consistency of flowing blood. Is that the spectacle you wish to gaze on, Mr Polaris? Do you really think you're capable of killing for a watch? Come on, give it to me. You look like a petty thief, Mr Polaris. A corpse-robber. You're wondering who'll detach the watch from your wrist... when the time comes? Sit down. No... On the couch. Lie down. You seem determined to spare me nothing. It's getting late, Mr Polaris. I'm thinking of my father. On the day he died, it was me who took off his watch. Today, it's different. We bury people with their Quartz wrist watch. Buried or not, the watch continues to keep time for a year. That's what I'm thinking about right now... All those guys who are buried with the exact time on their wrist. I look at my watch... I'm alive. I'm fine. I like my wife to lie to me. Out of respect... ...tenderness... ...laziness. Whenever I've thought about that, it's moved me. When we love each other, we have to lie. You were looking at me last night. You were simply beautiful. I wonder how flies see life. I wonder if there are sick flies... ...fragile flies... ...crazy flies... ...if they are jealous, possessive. I wonder if flies have memory... ...patience... ...or regrets. I wonder how long a fly lives. Subtitles by FatPlank
