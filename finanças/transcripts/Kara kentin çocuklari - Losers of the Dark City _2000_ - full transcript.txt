Is the bride doing well? About the same. Where's bride and groom? I don't know. -People are getting angry. That's all Mine's fault. Commission agents came, i swear they look like the Dupont Brothers. They began to fight, because each of them thinks only their key fits. I pushed the door like this. You should have seen their faces! You were saying, you would come with your mother, huh? You have been showing off, hehe? I don't know, she didn't give it. She kept saying, it would be affected by the evil eye. She is 100, but still thinks of marriage. Where were you? Fucking take it. -I almost get married in these clothes. The dummy's boobs were touching my back, so my mind was up in the air. What are we doing with the dummy? Invite her or let her be marriage witness, silent witness. Why the hell didn't you regard my size, when taking it? It's too long. Let me take care of it, bro. I shorten it, dude. Shorten it, dude. What do you say, K?rsat? Where has the registrar been? I got bored. I will never get married a place like this. Why are our dudes getting married? There are wheels within the wheels. You remember our bosses wedding? What a wedding it was. Why is the registrar still not here? -I don't know. You handsome man, i adore your mustache! That man... Is your father? You look gorgeous in this dress. I'm sick of this dress. I want to get the wedding over with. Wedding, huh? Wedding... You trapped me my boy. Trapped me! I don't care about the wedding. What difference does it make? I will fly away, if you cheat on me. I fly away! Away! You wanna do such a marriage? -Fuck off, girl. You both, do you wanna get married? Where are your witnesses? -Here, here, here. Two of them are enough. -Alright mate, i witness the general situation. Okay, i get it. Do you want to get married? -Yes. By the power invested in me, I declare you man and wife. Sign here. You go first. What does he take off? Come on, sign it! -Where? -Here, may be. Come on! -Girl! Step on his foot! You sign it, too. Come on, sign it! Kiss it, you promised. What are looking at? Come on! Good morning, Kemal. We are leaving. Why the hurry? It's not late. Having fun, huh? The nuptial night? -No it isn't. We were invited elsewhere. Bye! Don't tire her out, alright? Mine, tell me, if you need anything. Thanks, Kemal. See you. Bye. Techno music fucked my brain. I have a headache. I'm not having fun, I'm just working. I wouldn't get bored, if I was dancing around. Who were you calling at night? Let it go. You have a lighter? Who were you calling? Let it go. Let it! Tell me. -My uncle, uncle Mehmet. From the induction center. He said me to go there and apply otherwise i get snapped. And blah blah... Did you tell him that we got married? Baby, who cares? Right, my father didn't show up in the wedding. Fuck that military service. Look at them. Everybody is high. Hi. The job is done? -Yes, I got it done. What's up? -I'm fine. Look at this, bro! It is always full here! Always! Where will we sleep tonight? Never mind. Just hang out. We will sleep at home tomorrow, can you imagine? Our home! What's up, K?rs? You don't hang out at our place anymore. You turn out rotten. You can't get used to marriage. Whatever. I wish you happiness. Did you bang her? Tell me the truth. Did you? No, babe. There is no such thing. Our handsome guy banged her once. He is confused, i guess. -Finally you came, dude. Yes. -Will get the moving done tomorrow, mate? Otherwise, i will make the life miserable for you. You know that. Its done. That guy will get another job done. And the rest is mine. I'll take care of it tomorrow. Go for it. Dude? Let's shoot it up! -Sure. Mate, can you hand it? We are going by the tourism agency. My sister will take the visas. Greece, then Italy, then to the upnorth by train. And all the way to the America by ship. Awesome! Does such a thing exist? What does upnorth even mean, dude? We can go from mid-northwest to Madagascar. You think, we have the money? We don't need that much. Birsen needed just $500 to go to America and lives great there. I think, we would find that money. She got the green card somehow, it's great ... Yo Birsen, why haven't you sent the stamps... Are you waiting for a stamp or letter? You should get a stamp from her. She would put acid on it. Take the letter. The captain would accept you on the ship. And you nail her there. I don't mind, ship or no ship. It would go to America somehow. We should put together a band, we can say we're touring Utah. He would bang the drums, I play the bass. They hand out Visas all the time. Give us Visas, Mr. Consul! You fucked the Indians in the ass! Don't do this to us! I'm not coming! Fuck America. We would get old earlier, if we follow you. Are we going to fucking New York or doing a world tour? Sucker! Mine, open the door. You moved, my daughter? Need anything? Why didn't you tidy the house? You live downstairs right? Yes, downstairs. The Lord lives upstairs. Don't talk like this! -I saw you going into the apartment. You snuck out the house? I]ll break your legs! -Geez! Hi, brother. What is your name? -Mine. Let me show you round the house. Come and take a look. You see the two holes there? Rats always stop by. They eat the paper, if you cover it. Bastards! You say so! -I know a solution. Put gauze on the holes. Pour gas on it. They will burn for 2 days. You know what, we are supposed to cover the hole with ceramic. And remember, poison the rats, so they don't disturb us. There are too many of them! Is this your husband? -No. This is him. Is it good or what? Well, love is blind. I wish you happiness. She didn't like you. -This is it, kids. There are many boys now! Hi sweety. Welcome! Let me, my aunt. Why the fuck don't you kiss her hand? These are the bills for electricity and water. If you need anything, just knock on my door. Don't buy house, buy neighborhood, right? Let's move! Don't lean out of the window. The girl before you, got drunk and fell out. You know, God is watching How come? She threw herself out? Suicide, but i don't believe it. She used to drink a lot, maybe she fell. Enjoy the house! Fuck that! Is this a haunted house? I can't live like this! Did she say rats? I'd be better off at my military service. What the hell! Go then. I can call them to get you. ''Go and see, there are these big rats!'' 24.900.000 Lira. Fuck it mate, let her go. Mate, i saw a new kebab restaurant, by the tunnel. It is just for us. -Fuck you man, i'm sick of eating meat. He's right. I want fish at Bosphorus, right? C'mon Mine! -Alright dude, gotta choose what to wear. Women care about these things. Slow down now. 243 31 92, move! Hi, Rollhouse? I want to order something. 5 lahmacuns, 2 shish kebabs, 2 chicken d?ners 2 meatballs, ehm... I want 6 lahmacuns, please. Can you please bring 6 beers and... ...3 packs Marlboro, if you don't mind? Yes, i give you the directions... Thanks. Aunt Hafize? Did you go shopping? -I did. I'm also cooking, I would clean your room, if you opened it. It must be really dirty. No it is not, i clean my room everyday. How is my father going? Did he eat? Yes. Are you hungry? No. I eat, when i get hungry. I have something to do now. He is coming. Hi. Mehmet? Your orders arrived. Take them, i bring the Mercedes. I'll be right back. Okay. I'm coming. Yes, welcome. Give me them. How much does it cost? Mehmet? My darling? I forgot to order Coke and dessert. Can you bring them please, sweety? Sorry for the trouble. Alright. I bring them right away. -Good job. Did he throw himself? -Supposedly suicide, but I don't believe it... Is this a haunted house? I can't live in this house like this. What a pity... I feel for him. His boss would reprimand him so bad. Nothing will happen. He'll get fired and get another job. There are so many rollhouses in Istanbul. There smell of onion in every beautiful street. Don't be racist man! Rolls are much better than disgusting burgers. These are the necessities of the time. Corruption is very truth of evolution. Turning back to ape, huh? Did you see how he stared at Mine? I like the smell of sweat, you know. I like the smell of sweat. Can you put on a few slices of tomato? You do it on purpose, right bro? Take the parsley. Mine? Don't you eat tomato? You are such a freak. Everybody eats tomato. Why weird? Ever see me drinking water? I only drink beer. I'm allergic to water. I drink so much I can't even taste a tomato. That's psychological. I guess, i'm obsessed with something. With kernels you know. I swear, i feel very nauseous. Maybe i did so to attract attention, while i was a child. I don't know. Buddy, let's have some weed. -I always do. There haven't been women or music. I would do my military duty for 2 months. But 18 months! I would go mad! You know Selami, he has been on guard duty at a fountain for 10 months, i swear. He says he used to talk to that fountain. I would go mad! Be careful, they can come and take you from the bar all of a sudden. You would never realize, how it happens. Oh, Orhan. Welcome. -Hi. Come in. -Kemal sent this. What's up buddy? -The champaign is on the house. How are you, K?rsat, my buddy? You got a nice house. Enjoy it! Take a hit. We were having a small talk. Join us? No, dude. I gotta go. -Okay. See you later. -See you. Greetings to your friends! -Take care! ...my military service for 2 months. But it's 18 months! I would go mad!... That's a satellite receiver, you know? All channels are in it. Don't chit chat! If we were caught, we should buy another one. You talk too much! Just make the connection dude! I'll fucking do it! -Let me take it. Look at that fucking scene. Aerialman on the roof. Stop! Okay! It's very sharp. What's up? -How it's going? Hi. -Kursat? Let me talk to uncle. -Alright, go ahead. What's up? -Fine. You? How are you? -What's up geezer? Give me 2 sodas. -What's up with that? You ate like a dinosaur again, huh? We were at Iklim's. She caused trouble again. They fought all night. We said we wouldn't go back. Her money attracts you. That's why you go to her. I can't stand it! I would never contact her! Tell him the place buddy. -You know the junkyard? Remember, Sertan got us into trouble there? It is there. Alright? I got it. We will be there at 4. Okay. ?zg?r Where have you been, my boy? Let's go to bed. We are really high mate. -Yes. Let us go. -They won't let you in. Why won't they? I'm bored, I need a beer. -Bring me one, too. Come on man, take a shot. -Alright. Let's go. Who are they won't let us in! Good night, bro. Good night. -May we take a look inside for 15 seconds? Absolutely not. Just a minute, we have friends there. -We said no. Bro. Bro, i won't go in, they will, huh? Yes, we will go in. Let's move guys. -Come on. You embarrassed me! I said, they won't let you in. We'd beat them so bad, if we got in. You see the people coming from there? They were so high. There is smack worth 500 million in there. They let you in without money? Who the hell are you? You are so strange, he kissed you, and you didn't say anything. And he thinks he's a big shot. I saw you with that faggot. What the hell! Does he think you'll go back with him? I thought it was you. I really did. You give him hope. It is not you, you wouldn't give hope. You didn't realize? He is a mess! How could you endure him so many years? You piss me off. Are you a bitch or what? -You talk too much. Did I say anything about the bitches you dated before? They are gone. Gone. You want to examine them? Don't humiliate me because of the men I dated! He came near me, so i had to say hi. I wouldn't have! Do I treat my ex like that? You get on my nerves. Are you mad or what? Come on. Let them go, talk to me. I love you, you know that. I don't lie to you. Happy birthday. A new day, it is 00.00 o'clock. I always remember my dad on my birthdays. They gave me a 10th birthday party. My dad showed up... with a red chevrolet, it was like a girl. It is supposed to bring me luck. He said so. The boys in my district get in the car, went to the amusement park. We had such a good time. You know the chains? For the children? 2 groups were fighting to get in. The couch with the chain hit my head and i was down! Look, here is the scar. I kiss it. My baby. I'm fond of scarred men. You are sick. How many of your boyfriends were scarred? You're pissing me off again! You are unbelievable. Mine, wait! Don't answer. Don't be ridiculous. Who is it? -It's me, your neighbour. Open up. I brought you tea breads. I made them this morning. I thought you'd eat them with your husband. Thanks. Good job, yes. I was terrified. Shit, this woman would knock our door all the time. Tell her something, say we live in the night. Or I'll beat her. What can you do, she loves us. She thinks we're newlyweds. She thinks we're a normal family. Don't worry, next time i open the door naked. Funny, huh? You open it. Bye bye! She won't come back. Bring it down mate. Recruitment office? Give me your head's name. Okay. Now get your head on the phone, private. Good day. Is it Tahsin, the lieutant? I'm Sedat Kaplan, the lieutant from airforce. Can I have halvah with peanuts? -Alright. Enjoy your meal, the halvah is on the house. The family, I mean the brother is very sorry. And she is little out of the way. You know, her friends... She has the opportunity to join some factions. I think, we should rescue this girl. I will be delighted, if you handle it. We're 30 and see how we live like shit. Fuck's sake, i told you thousand times to leave here. You couldn't. You wouldn't love another place like Istanbul. Everybody lives like they want. If I have the chance, I fly away. And I don't hear from you. You say so? I got married under compulsion, You think I'll let you fly away? If you fly away... I'll riddle you with holes. I pour hot oil to your ear. Scarify you. Scarify... Where have you been? I really have to piss now. Seref, tell him the story. -What's up? Went to meet Kazim at the bath. There were two guys there and we got worried. Kazim didn't show up. Then we go where? -To Madam. She fucked you right? Don't go to her, man! Cut it off, it gets sour. What's this? She really fucked you. I wouldn't buy it if today wasn't your birthday. Call him, put the money in the basket. Read the note in the basket. We can always go to somewhere else. Eat that shit. Happy birthday, Kursat. Alright, let me slice it. -Wait just 1 more minute. My present to you before i get high. Happy birthday bro. Thanks buddy. Seref, where is my present? What present? You're grown up, and still want a present? Sure I do. Give it to me! Pass here mate. -Yes, give it to me. Kursat, we decided to give this a jerk... like you... -Like you. We said you are 30 years-old and unemployed. And we collected money to buy these. Can I have this if you go to the army? -Why man? These are useless there. You going to the army now? Take this with you. You could make balloons from this. You could play volleyball with the Lieutenant. Bravo. Come on, drink. -Happy birthday Kursat... Please don't say we drink to Kursat. I drink to Istanbul, the most beautiful city of the world. I love you Istanbul. The city with streets named after executed politicians. Its celebrities are silicone; its roads have bitchy holes. Istanbul, which breastfeeds everyone with its droopy tits. I drink to Taksim. I drink to Mine, to my love. Who is it? - I heard something like "happy birthday!" You don't need anything, huh my daughter? Hello. -Yes! I heard it right. Whose birthday is it? Yours? I'd have cooked something, if I'd known. Please sit here. The flower is for you. -Thank you. Mom, look at the candle on the cake. Poison for the...? Champagne? -No, i prefer tea. Let me have it, buddy. Cake... Do we slice it? We do it somehow. Let's eat it then. I'm doing it. -Sure. I will bring the tea. No way, a lady should do it. Let her, mate. The guest... first. I'll give some to the other guest in the kitchen. Mom, will you buy me a plane? Yes, i will. Who was the man at home pulling your hair? Hairdresser, coiffeur he is. He will comb my hair. Mum, when will my dad come? -He will, my son. Why do you go around naked, when the coiffeur is at home? Shut up or I'll make you eat shit. Go ahead mother! You are wonderful! You're laughing at me right? Okay, make fun of me. I got old and these dogs make fun of me. I'm bored, i'm leaving. I'm going to home. I don't care anyone. Enjoy your freedom, Mama. -Only God knows, if I will. I'm gonna go! I will flirt! I will do everything! We are going to America. Come with us, if you want. No need to conquer the ocean. You know the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia? We float a raft all the way to Alaska. Then we reach America by foot. No need for timber, I'll carry her on my back. You bet. What would your husband say about this? He died. He can't say anything. What did you say mama? You see, i'm trembling. I'll wear a swimsuit, don't interfere! Oh my daughter! Wear it! Wear it! Wear a bikini. You are still young. You can wear a g-string too! Why are you talking that way? You are young, too. You are hot! You know, my mama's boobs were like a stone! -That was nasty. -Doesn't matter. My father never squeezed them. When he died, they were extinguished like a balloon. Have any more cake? -No, we don't. She is high, you see? Whatever, I'm selling all my jewelry and getting silicon boobs. Look at how comfortable they are. Don't be shy of me, i'm still young. Relax. Relax. Does K?rsat Can live here? Who is K?rsat Can? -It's me. Let's go young man. To the station. -Let me see all your IDs. What is going on? A war? I want to see your ID, too. Why are you running away? This is your sacred duty. Sir... -What are you saying? Let's stop there, he is going nowhere. Babe, calm down. Is she your girlfriend? -My wife. Look madam... -What if she doesn't want to do it? What? That doesn't matter. -Look. Today is his birthday. We have just got married. Leave us for a day. Then he will go to you. Please, we are doing our job. He has to do his duty. Wait a second. K?rsat! Was it you, you put them onto his scent? Why would i do that? Are you fucking crazy? Then who was it? We have just moved. Nobody knows us here. I'm gonna go mad! Only you told him to go to the army. So what? His uncle maybe? It's very obvious. Nobody can hide everything. One day we'll find out. That day, I will do my worst. I wonder, where did they take him? Where is he? Poor man. He couldn't enjoy his birthday party. He will always remember this birthday. I'm surprised, how they took him. He was puzzled, when seeing the soldiers, did you notice? You didn't noticed, you stepped on the lieutenant, huh? -He was a fucking sergeant. Sergeant first class. -He was a sergeant? He stepped on him. They will beat him so bad because of it. Please don't. Not the time for having fun. I'm going to the military office. You, don't make such jokes. And you, don't get obsessed with K?rsat. You are fucking insane, don't doubt us. Crazy. -Not on us, its you he doubts. You were always saying putting him on the scent, weren't you? Tell us straight, did you do it? What the fuck are you talking about? You think I called them? She doubts you and i think she is right. Nobody except us knows this place. Fuck you, if you don't believe me. You are all faggots. I'm gonna find out which motherfucker did it. Sertan, let's do it. C'mon. Please, buy a hanky. I don't want it, get out of my way. -Please mama. I don't want it. I said, i don't want it. I said, i don't want it. Hi guys, what's up? -What's up? How are you? Anything from K?rsat? Did you found out who the informant is? You still think it was me? I don't know. They didn't tell me. He joined the army today, in Sivas. "Your husband is a private now, you should be proud of it." They said. It's a terrible place. Somebody calling you... Hello. My dear. I missed you, too. Where are you now? How are you? What happened? I can't believe it. Don't do it. Take care. Please be patient. Alright, write a letter and send right away. Look forward to hearing from you. I love you. Okay, you take care, too. Darling, goodbye. Hey! Thanks Kemal. -Don't be sad, Mine. We all did our military duty. He will get used to it. If something disturbs you, we'll find a way out. I'm always here to help you. Thanks Kemal. He went at a bad time. Anyway, see you later. We are broadcasting in an illegal way. Underground free TV. Gay, bitch and pure youth. Perverts. This channel is broadcasting for you. We are sure, you love us. There is nothing else to do in this dipshit world. Come and watch us. Watch the Free Tv. Look, these pictures are only set for you. Ow, what a shame, it's dying. There is no picture to make you feel disturbed. These are facts of life. Ouch, is it shaving? Like a woman waxing. Free TV. Broadcasting for the people who take risks. This is for the gay people. Eat, eat. Eat nonstop. Eat until you explode. Propagate. Propagate! You see? Our old uncle eats, too. Then you shit this? This is the reality! Ouch, black hole. No, it's not. Pardon me. Your channel, your drainage. This can't happen guys. I was frozen. Illegal broadcasting, fucking great! Classy! I can't put it into words, you should see it. No, nobody wrote about it. Maybe you were dreaming? I didn't see anything, either. I was watching TV all night and didn't see it. You were high that night, huh? You didn't see it guys. It was classy. The usual broadcast was stopped. Then Free Tv began to broadcast. I was surprised. I saw somebody shitting. Don't laugh at me. You should see it, it was amazing. We won't steal anything, right? We go in and give fake dollars, take the real ones. I'm talking about 5 or 6.000 bucks here. And it's done. My glassy man does the same. On computer. The same thing. They can't tell that they are fake. You think, it is that simple? Are you insane? You don't know the glassy? You can't trust him. He always talks about this job, to everybody. They'll catch us. Then fuck us. -He is an informant you say. Stop there. Let's be smart. We'll deceive him with a party. Bring a couple of girls. Then he will spill the beans, that's how we do this job. While he's fucking the girl in there, we will do the job. It's that simple. Mate, do you know any girl fucking that psycho? Nobody. Let's go to America by train. The pills don't help me anymore. Hafize said so. It helps, Hafize don't get it. She is ignorant. Look, exchange the money in the bank with dollars. And make a withdrawal and make Hafize's payment. Tell her to cook Dolma. And buy a couple of games for me. Got it? Alright dad. -Take a bath. Get out! I had a bath yesterday, dad. Who is it? -It's a messenger. Good day. Sign. Thanks. You are the 3000th person watching us. Congratulations. Hi guys, welcome. -Thanks. You work hard, huh? I'm not happy with this. Fuck that, dancing makes me feel good. What's up? Did you get a letter from Kursat? No, i didn't. I wonder if he forgot about me. Look, I got one. He will send me one eventually, i guess. He didn't write an address, either. Give it to me. Your babe is a mysterious man. I watch television all night long, because you talked about the Free Tv. I didn't see it. This is special, not everyone can watch it. I'm 3000th televiewer, look. Hey, how are you? -Wow. We were talking about you, fuck. We would call you to come, but you came yourself. I come to look around. -You gotta dance, too mate. We were saying, you were on the job. Yeah, some girls are coming by, but you can always come to my place. I know a girl, crazy about computers. And I talked about you hacking passwords. She went nuts. She wants to get to know you. What do you say? I didn't tell anything about you. If you are interested... Don't tell her about me, alright? Alright, I won't. Is she hot? Of course she is! -C'mon, please. We wouldn't tell you if she was ugly. So what do we do now? I guess, she is off tomorrow. Tomorrow we'll come to your place? Please, come to my place. Please. What do you drink? -Whiskey, don't you drink? On me! See that dollar? Fuck that! Fuck it. I will be right back in a minute, got to see my friends. Come to my place tonight. We will see Free Tv. Okay. It ain't happening dude! He's kicked out the house, but he won't leave. Unbelievable. Tevfik says: "I'm not here for you. I came to see Metin." This is Metin's house, too. Punk! It's not Metin's house. Right? -Tevfik is a sly dog, tries to break them up. C'mon let's cut it. He is making us angry, dude. They can't keep up their relationship, if they are influenced so much from outside. We shouldn't have got the ex. I knew someday they would break up. Metin got used to humiliating her, all the time. That doesn't fit us. The girl kick Tevfik, the faggot, and he refuses to leave. And Metin says nothing about it, unbelievable. I got in and after 15 seconds they began to fight. And they put the blame on me. Then Yesim kept staring at Tevfik. She walked into the kitchen. Took a bottle of wine and smashed it on the wall. She was screaming at Tevfik. "Get out of my home!" Unbelievable, Tevfik was frozen. Metin stood up and slapped her in the face. What a slap that was, like revenge for the past Yesim took her purse and got out. What about Tevfik? -She left, he stayed. Strange situation He wanted to leave, but he can't. He would blame himself, if he had left. I mean, the will to leave, but he couldn't make that happen. The will to leave -C'mon. You talk too much. Change the topic, I'm bored. I don't care about Tevfik, the faggot. Surely, he has been thinking how to capture the house. Look at us, we are philosophically discussing people. That's not our case, dude! Hello, Nazim? Alright darling, I'll call you back. He had 21 days left to leave the army. I was thinking about how to tell you this. Can I have some please? Hello. Sedat? I miss you, too. Bye! Turn that phone off girl! I'm talking! -Okay. Let's drink. Then i said: "They shot your mom... ...and kidnapped your sister." Fuck that, if you say so! You should have said... ..."your fucking mom is dead, and raped your sister's corpse." You couldn't have said that. You trying to piss me off? Do you want something? Beer. -Drink pee. Which of them will I fuck? Does it matter? -It doesn't, but it does. Which one? So it matters you say. Are trying to make trouble? Look, i only care about money, alright? Take this. Like we talked. The glassy man. You fuck him, but don't talk about our deal. What about the tall guy? -Sure thing! We have Brad Pitt on the next door, if you like. Crazy! Here they come! -Thanks. Glassy... Glassy -What? You promised me. Alright, alright. You plague my life. Hello Sedat. I will call you back. Great. -We can print it now. Wow. Let me take it. -That's great! Good job! Thanks for showing this. -No problem. Well... It's me. Banu. I'm sorry for holding you here. You go to your girl. I'm sick of dudes in there. Can i surf on the internet for a while? Okay, don't forget to lock the door when you are leaving. -Okay. Don't worry. Don't exhaust her! -Sure thing! I don't understand how this glassy does it. Bro. The man taking these dollars should be drunk. Otherwise the glassy will be beaten everyday. I would stick them in his ass, if he tries to fool me with these. Joke money is more realistic. C'mon, nobody will notice it. They will get mixed with the real dollars. Don't interfere, it's my organisation. It will be very easy. Nothing will happen. We cheat them easily. You don't need us, you just open the door and change them. We don't come with you. You don't need us there. Are you crazy? I need you so much. Seref, there is phone box next to Divan hotel, You can see the building from there. I will give you their number, if something goes wrong, just ring once. Look Sertan. You will be on the motocycle. Pretend like it's broken. Otherwise the police won't allow you to stop there. Mine? Don't you have beer? You are getting very ungenereous. You drink like a cow, I don't have any more money. C'mon you handsome, get on the motocycle and bring us some beer. I heard, the Persian guys fake dollars best... ...in order to collapse the american economy. They replicate it, you can't see the difference. It's easy when the government supports you. You have possibilities. Seref, open the door. -Let us rob the bank mate! Don't play me Mission Impossible! Where the fuck have you been for 2 hours? You went behind a naked girl or what? You always experience such interesting things. You ruined these dollars, while i'm not around. Mine, this is from Kursat. Why didn't I see it? I bought the beers and got out of the market... I saw the motocycle was gone. I got mad! I thought it was stolen. I was high, you know. You are pissed off, huh? Seref. There is a note for you in the end. Bastard! You see it, if you take the band off. -Yes, make fun of me. Seref, why did you do it? What did I do? He makes fun of it. Don't you get it? What fun? Don't you see it? He wrote it! Would you please fuck off? Look Mine, i didn't put him on the scent. What the fuck do you want from us? You thought, ''I'll fuck you, when he is in the army''. Fucker! Don't get mad! -What are you doing? You punks! You don't see Kursat as your friend? We just got married. How could you do it? I don't trust you! This fucker Seref can sell me out easily! Get out of this house. Fuck off! Get out! You, too. Get out! I don't want to see anyone of you. Hello, is this the army? I called for a Private there. His name is Kursat Can. He joined the army 25 days ago. His troop? I don't know. How? How can't you find him? Isn't it written on the records? I'm his wife. Can you please tell him to call the bar for me. The bar. Nightclub. Thank you so much. Why are you looking? What do you want? -You talked too much. I don't talk for nothing. Punks!

Why don't you leave me alone! Son of a bitch! You cow! Enough! Show it to your mother! Look at me Mine. I'm gonna leave, if you yell. We discussed this all night long. You wanna drink beer? I just wanted to talk. Sorry for the night. I still can't believe it. I can't believe it. You have a lighter? How did Seref do it? How did he? Why did he? Why? He is Kursat's best friend, if you ask him. I would tear him to pieces, if he was here. Second one? -4 Good evening. -Good evening. Mine. This is our new Dj, Og?n. This is Mine . Hi Og?n. -Hi. Welcome to our place. Kemal, any calls for me? No, he didn't call you? I'm saying... why wouldn't he call a beauty like you? I wouldn't care about the army, if you belonged to me. I'd dream of you, you are good! Kemal, you keep dreaming... You will always dream of me. Can I help you? -I will order in a minute. Hey, look. They are same. Where did you find it? Are you watching, too? Yes madam. I'm watching it, too. Finally i found another viewer of the channel. Let me buy you a drink. Thanks, i don't drink. -What a strange channel, isn't it? It's very interesting at the same time. I watch it curiously. Yeah, me too. I know some people, who make the show. Is that so? Wait a minute. You are special, not everyone can wear that badge. Don't take it off. I'm leaving. Look, come anytime, we will talk. We have a topic in common. You tell them to show hard movies, huh? I don't know, tell them not to keep showing documentaries.

Somebody is calling you. -Okay. Remember it! Hello. Hello, Kursat? Kursat? Kursat? Hello? Welcome to Free Tv! How are you tonight? I will show an interesting and cleverly planned robbery, but the jerks were caught, just because they made a little mistake. You will go mad! First a little break. Commercials! Jockey condoms! How is it? Funny? You have always waited for this moment! You wait just a little more. You know why you are waiting? We Free Tv cameramen recorded... ...how these jerk robbers are caught by police... ...because they made a little mistake. Yes, we are watching it now. The jerk number 1 was caught on his motocycle. The jerk number 2 is being dragged, while he is beaten. Mine, I don't get it. Why am I here? How did the cop... How did the cops find me? What if Seref put them on the scent? I will get insane by thinking about this. I must be him then. He put Kursat on the scent, too. Why would he do that? Is he insane? I visited Arif at the hospital. There was his family, cops... I couldn't see him. Sertan fell so bad. I felt horrible when i saw him. I felt terrible. -How is that possible? You saw him falling? Yes, I did. Wait a second. What? Are you...? What? Are you our enemy? Sertan? How can you say that? -How could you possiblly know that? I watched the Free TV yesterday. How could I see it then? Where did they find out? Nobody but you knows Free TV! You talk like a schizophrenic! Are you fucking kidding us or what? Sertan? How can you speak like this? -Look at me. They ripped my ear! They pulled my earrings! Look at that. Sertan, what are you talking about? -Fuck you! Sertan, look at me dude! Sertan, look here. -Get out, leave me alone. Mine We are fucking tonight? -Enough of you! You pig!

C'mon sleeper, wake up. What a great day this is! My dear. Listen to me, please. Okay. -Don't get me wrong. You are a great person. I mean, it is just sex. It happened, just beacuse i wanted it. Don't mix it with our friendship, alright? Try to understand me. I'm looking forward to a man. You understand me? We can just be friends. Dad. Hi, my daughter. I'm sorry, I just... Let's sit there. How are you? I'm not good. I'm a little down. Somebody found Kursat, and they took him to the army. I left my job in the meanwhile. I can't pay the rent. I'm not good, you know. Who is Kursat? Your friend? -He is my husband. Why weren't you at our wedding? I was waiting for you. Didn't your wife tell you about it? She told me that you would come etc. Tell me the truth dad. Goddamn it! Alright! Ofcourse she told me. I wasn't around here. I wish you happiness. Bad thing, he joined to army, huh? What a shame! I don't know. It's complicated. I mean, i need some money. I miss you Dad. I haven't heard anything from Mom in 2 years. She left Cologne. You remember Zeki's son Murat? I saw him, he told me, that she is gone. She went to Mannheim, he said. I wrote a couple of letters, i guess she didn't get them. Maybe she doesn't want to talk to me. You know, she is crazy. Fuck destiny! Your mom ruined us all. Mine, don't be sad. You are stronger than all of us. I trust you. Mine, take this. Put it in your pocket easily. My wife shouldn't see, you know. She talks too much then. I'm looking for the badge like this one. -No we don't have them. Alright, thanks. Hi. Can I sit? -Oh, hi! Sure. Dude, I got obsessed with it, you know. I always look for that badge on people's collars . I haven't seen it yet. Listen It was great yesterday. Jockey, huh. It was wonderful! Let me ask you something. How did they know about the robbery? They must have a lot of men in the intelligence department. I couldn't watch it yesterday, i wasn't home. Was it good? I came by your bar. You weren't there. I thought you'd gone. I came to offer you a job. I resigned, there was a problem. We couldn't get along. What job? Free TV needs a speaker. They care a lot about talent. She must be one of their crazy members. Frankly, I talked about you at the meeting. They wanted to interview you. What do you say? I think you are the one, they are searching for. They won't accept me. I can't talk so fluently. It would be great actually. I'm unemployed now. You think I could do it? What's your name? -Emre. I'm Mine. Would you like a drink? -No, thanks. I gotta go. I have a meeting, I'm gonna tell them about you. How can I reach you? Can you give me your number? We can meet here yesterday. Then on 5 o'clock? Okay. Hey, bitches, gays, perverts... I'm your new speaker, Mine! Mine is not good. Ayla! We will show the weirdest shows, you will never imagine! I have so much to tell you. Is it good? How did they find me, dude?! G?lay, can i have tea please? -Okay. Hi Miss, i guess you didn't wait too long. Good news. Is that so? Please sit down. In the meeting there was a man who knows you from the bar. So? -He supported you, too. They want to try you out on air. They want me to do that? Is that so? Are these suitable? Not bad. Good for the beginning. We'll look for better things later. Let me look, maybe I can find better dresses. This speech is very harsh. Doesn't this disturb the audience? There are very strange pictures. -It gets weirder and weirder. They take a lot of ads, too. -There are so much crazy people in the country! I was guessing, only I am crazy. I'm one of them. So, I am innocent, I'm a normal person. Miss, you have all the talent, the channel is looking for. You can trust me. Do you smoke? How about a joint? I don't. -Wow. You jellyfish. You don't eat, don't drink. What a strange boy. It's very dirty here. Can't we do it anywhere else? You know. We do it like this. You will get used to it. It doesn't take too long. We'll do it fast, let me get ready. Mine! Are you ready? Have a look at the dialogue if you want. Remember, we should be the best channel. Alright, I do my best. But it stinks! I fell uncomfortable. I'm ready, let's do it and get out. We begin. Action! Yes, maniacs and punks! From now on you are gonna watch me! You are gonna be addicted to this show! What you see is the shits from all over the country. You see, i'm shitting here, too! And i want to show something to you. The thing you want to see most! I open it! You will be terrified, when you see it! First commercials! I can't hold on, mate. What if we record the rest anywhere else? -Be patient, we are almost done. Look, you are gonna take shits from the closet... ...and spread them on your body. You should present the show in the meanwhile. There is a hole in the closet, you see. Enough, I can't endure that smell. Emre, that's enough. You are being capricious on the first shoot. Let's get equal, ...to make you feel comfortable. See? We are equal now. I spread the real shit by the way. And i... enjoy this. C'mon undress! C'mon! Let's begin. -Here you go! We have no choice other than living with the shit in this deepshit world! You better get used to live with shit! Yes, we pause now, you listen to music. Don't touch me. What the fuck are you doing? Are you psycho? Don't touch me! I said, don't touch me! Who do you think you are? You won't broadcast this show! Give me the tape! Now! I said, give me the record! Don't touch me! Don't touch me! Get away, i said get away! You smell like shit! -What do you think i am, huh? What do you think? Is this your job? What were you thinking? What were you?! What? What a shitty man are you! That's it. I got exhausted. It is very high. But it is worth it. It has a nice sight. -Yes. I liked your house. I can stay here tonight, if you want. How is Gamze doing? She left. You know me. -I know. Don't get me wrong, i can stay, if you want. No, thanks. I need to be alone. I should put myself together. Okay, if you say so. You know it better. Don't forget to lock the door. -Alright, don't worry. Come to my place, anytime you want. Good night. -Bye. Yes, maniacs and punks! From now on i'm gonna present the show! You are gonna be addicted to this show! What you see is the shit from all over the country. I'm shitting here, too. And i want to show you something. The thing you want to see at most! Enough, i can't endure that smell. Emre, that's enough. You are being capricious on the first shoot. Let's get equal, ...to make you feel comfortable. Don't touch me. What are you doing! Are you maniac or what? Don't touch me! I said, don't touch me! Show it to your mother, alright? Show it to your mother, you son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! -Enough! Enough of you jerks! Don't be a racist. It's better than the other hamburgers. This is the modern world. Degeneration is the actual evolution. You mean, we are being apes now. You see the way he looked at Mine? I beat him. Mine, can you put some tomato in it? Hi. You recognize me? The channel for maniac, gay, psycho and bitch people...
