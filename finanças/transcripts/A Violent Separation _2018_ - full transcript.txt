Subtitles by explosiveskull People come visit here. They all say the same thing. It's so peaceful. Of course, people don't ever really say what they're thinking. If they did, they'd say, shit. It doesn't matter what the hell we do here on this earth. It will keep going with or without us. And maybe that's what it comes down to. In a world where the only constants are time and loss, and the only true choice left to us is who we choose to have alongside. Our top story. Wild ride on Wall Street continues Thursday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunging more than 200 points for the fourth time this year. In local news, area farmers were counting on an increased productivity to meet rising demand, but a recent study noted... Great. Just a science cloud. - Go ahead and bring you down. - Hey cowboy. Yeah? your birthday party. Wait. Your black society. Your black society. Your black society. - Don't let 'em change your... - Mom. Sorry, baby. OK. First day of school. You are going to look so nice. You know Abbey saw that. Well, a cheat begets a cheat, little brother. I do not understand your relationship. You find this funny, Ray? Can I see that? You do this again? You know, if you spend less time investigating me and more time investigating Frances, you might find yourself having a bit more fun there, cowboy. Woo. Norm. Thank you. Hey. Norm. Come on, man. Hey, guess who just got uninvited for my birthday party. Your brother is an asshole. - Is your dad up? - Yeah. Here, take the damn thing. OK, come on. You're OK, Daddy. Let's get this on you. I'll do it myself here. Breakfast is ready. Uh, sir. Do you know that antenna came off your Pop's old 3100. That was a solid truck. He had that truck before he had you. Hell, he came riding in on that truck when he came here looking for a job. That truck killed him too, you know. Slid right off the ice. I know, sir. You guys hear me? Neighbors heard you. Hey, Norman. Morning, Frances. Liam. Hey. You staying for breakfast? I can't. Got work. Guess we'll be seeing you tonight at Ray's birthday. Yes, ma'am. I'll make sure Fran wears her dress. OK. What you got there, deputy? 24 feet, six inches. You say 24 six. Yes, sir. 24-6. Right there it is, ain't it? Your county starts south of Am Road. Looks like it's on yours, Ed. And here I thought since your county pays to maintain it, the road belongs to you. There it is right there. That's the road we on. That's the road. That's a river. The river? On maps, rivers are blue, much like in life, unless you're in Texas, Thing is my coroner's on vacation. Ain't got nobody to do an autopsy. Blackwood County mandates anybody dies under 40 - got to have an autopsy. - All right. - You know that, Eddy. - All right. All right. Have your grandson load the bodies in the back of my truck. In the back of my truck, not the cab like the last time. You got it. You want me to call the coroner's office? No. Cause of death is loss of life. Let's get you tucked in. OK. There we go. Mom. Yeah? You going to get drunk as a pig? - Who'd you learn that? - Grandpa. That's what he says every time you go out with Uncle Ray. I don't want you saying those things to me, OK? OK. Sorry. You know you're my one true man, right? I love you, babe. OK. Are you ready? Yeah. Would you hurry up. OK. Now let's see the other side. He likes you. I don't want to like him. Why not? Because look at you ad Ray always fighting and cheating. It's bullshit. Ow. Oh, I'm sorry. Did that hurt? I don't know. He's changed. It's like ever since he came back from service, become a mute. It's good, you know, letting somebody love you. Well, look at you. You might still have a chance at a normal life. You really do look beautiful. Thank you. Come on. The boys are waiting. What is it about El Camino? What draws you to her? What draws you to Cinch? Maybe she has something I don't, like gonorrhea or the herpes. Or maybe she knows how to shoot a gun, or wears. You're an asshole. Some sideshow, huh? I was kind of hugging you'd get your handcuffs back. Yeah. I need 'em for work. Fine. I want you to teach me to shoot. I'm not kidding. Well, then, baby, I'm going to need my hands if I'm going to teach you how to shoot a gun. Keep dancing, cowboy. I'm going to go. Thanks for the drink. Was it something I said? No. No. I'm just tired. Make sure Abbey gets home, OK? Frances, just hold on a sec. What? Did you want to dance? - Norman. - I'm sorry. Just... I'm just not good with this kind of stuff. What stuff? You know, romantic gestures. You don't have to be Don Juan. We used to talk, Norman. Even when you went away, we talked on the phone. We... I know. I know. I just come back and I see my brother and your sister. I don't want to to be us. Yeah. Ray. I been fucking Abbey. What the hell is going on? These assholes are talking shit on Abbey. Let's go. Come on. You want to spend another night in jail? Huh? OK. Everyone, just relax. Hun, uncuff me. Son of a... Uncuff me. Honey. Go get 'em. You son of a bitch. Come on. Let's go. Abbey. What? You're drunk. So? My earring. Jesus, Frances. What... Hey, you think you're special. - Abbey! - Hey. Leave me alone. Abbey. Give me the keys. Abbey, give me the keys. I'm so sick of this bullshit. Then keep out of it. Move on. What would you know about being with someone? Abbey, come... Abbey! Whose side are you on? You already got two priors, Ray, both through fighting. What if someone would have pressed charges? Oh, you wanted to get your ass kicked? Huh? I can look after myself, Ray. Oh yeah? I'm still drunk and I can still kick your ass, bro. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Damn it. Son of a bitch. Hey. Look at this. It's for the trailer. I got it engraved and everything. Our trailer? Our trailer. It's for Abbey. What do you think? Make sure she doesn't make a mess. Sweet though. Thought I'd try not to make a mess before I wed. I need a place to fuck in the trailer. Not in my room. You got a bigger bed. And your sheets are always clean. Hey. Hey. - I got a surprise for you. - Yeah? Yeah. What is it? If you want to see, you got to come with me. Babe, I"m tired. I'm hungover. I'm even drunk at the same time. Come on then. It's still dark out. Are you a cowboy or what? What the hell are you doing? I told you I want you to teach me how to shoot. And where'd you get that thing? Took it from my daddy's office. Jesus Christ. - And what if he finds out? - He won't. I've never in my entire life seen him take it out, OK? No one saw me. Relax. Well, I ain't teaching you how to shoot. - Why not? - Because. Why not? Because you like dressing up in makeup, and earrings, and all that kind of stuff. Why do you want to learn how to shoot anyway? You're a girly girl. Oh, and El Camino is a real woman? Oh Jesus Christ. What she hold a gun in hand, and a wrench in the other, and a long neck between her tits? Would you watch what you're doing with that thing. At least Cinch isn't afraid to tell me he loves me. Oh, that's some bullshit. You believe him? What do you think? I don't know. You fall for any guy that sells you the love line. I mean, it worked for Liam's daddy, didn't it? Don't you dare bring my son into your bullshit, Ray. Where are we going? Somewhere I can shoot something. Darling, stay... - Don't call me stupid. - Will you just stop the car? - No. - Stop the car. - Let go. - Look, I heard you. I hate you, Ray. Let go. Ah! Damn it. What is wrong with you? You know what, Ray, you're right. I do love him. I love that he cares enough to lie. I love his stupid friends And I love his damn cock. Ugh. Fuck. Fuck. Oh God. Abbey. Abbey. Abbey. Abbey. Baby, baby. Abbey. Abbey. Abbey. Please be OK. Oh. No. Come here, baby. OK. So help banana. And then... get Norm. I'll get Norm. I'm going to get you that trail, OK? See this? See this? That's your key right there. Hey baby. I got you. I got you. I got you. Honey, I'm sorry. All right. Ready? Very good. Oh, yeah. There you go. Hey, baby. - Hello? - Hey Norm. I fucked up. I fucked up really bad. Ray, what the hell is this? You hurt? She wanted to learn how to shoot. It was an accident. Jesus Christ. The gun just went off. It just fucking went off. OK. She was holding it and I tried to get it out of her hand and... you believe me, don't you, Norm? It was... it was an accident. Where is she? I got rid of her. Jesus, Ray. What'd you... You believe me, don't you, Norm? I swear to God. I swear it was an accident. It doesn't matter. You moved her. You fucking moved her. And now it looks like murder. What was I supposed to do? I got two priors. Who'd believe me? Huh? Yeah. Exactly. What do you want me to do, Ray? You want me to lie for you, say you weren't here? You asked me to come here. I'm here. Tell me exactly what you want me to do. I don't know. Yes, you do. - I don't know. - Yes, you do. I want you to say it. It's important. Say what? What it is you want me to do. Why? Because it's important, Ray. It's important. I want you to help me cover this up. That what I want you to do. I want you to help me cover this up. Please, Norm, I'm begging you please. Come on, boy. Where's your sister? I don't know. What's wrong, honey? - I want the frosted cereal. - OK. You ain't his mama. Abbey, wake up. Abbey. Norm, you there? Come in, Norman. Go ahead, Patty. Just got a call for an abandoned car up by Lake Sherburne. Man said he just came upon it sitting in the middle of the road. You call a tow truck? Caller says there's blood in it. I should probably wake the sheriff for this. Probably should then. Sheriff. That's Abbey Campbell's car? Yes, sir. Radioed Patty about five minutes ago to ask Tom if Abbey's home. Son, I think I should take this by myself. If it's all the same to you, sir, Abbey's family. What this is, I'd like to see it through. Boys, bring Axel and Cesar up. I want you to work these woods about 100 yards out. The lake is down there about 200 yards if need be. Well, she rolled to a stop. Didn't touch the brakes. This is where the bullet come out. It was fired from the inside. I guess not. So what, she's driving along and she... she stops because she sees someone she knows. And they come around the side of the car and then she... no. Why would anybody be standing out here? This is some bullshit. That is some bullshit. There are six sets of prints here. And two of them ain't human. Me, you, two barking boys and their dogs? Whoever did this, they traded in their legs for a set of wings and they just flew around. They never touched down. They didn't put a pinky down. Not a pinky. Ed, Norman? This is Ed. Ed, Tom said that Abbey's not at home. Tom says that her bed is still made up. Thanks, Patty. Right. We better get up to the house and put together a timeline. Are you OK with this? Yes, sir. Car's just off the lake. It's cold so it's been there a few hours at least. Those are Abbey's keys. Look, right now she's just not home. That's all. She could be out with friends. We need to ask you all some questions. Did anybody see Abbey come home last night? No. When was the last time you saw her? Last night at the Whispering Pig. What time? About midnight. We left the bar and I went on ahead myself. I forgot she had a car with her. By the time I looked back, she was driving off the other way. Was she with anyone? No. I don't think so. You're not certain? She was alone. Any idea where she was headed? No. She was drunk. I tried to stop her. Why did you walk on ahead back to the ranch? Why didn't you get a ride? I was mad at her for something. Girl stuff. Few of the guys said some words about Abbey at the Pig. Ray and them got into it. I tried to stop it. Anything serious? Nothing out of the ordinary. What did you and Ray do after the bar? We went home, went to bed, woke up this morning. Ray had a flat though, puncture on the left side. So I took him to Hank's to get a new one about 9:30. Are Ray and Abbey still dating? Who can keep track? They're on and off. She's been with Cinch half the nights last week. What is Cinch's last name? Cinch... damn it. They always run out the wrong time. You got a pen? I'll get one from the cruiser. Just fucking tell him. Just fucking tell him. Just fucking tell him. Sheriff's department. Sheriff's department. Hello. Whoa. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, whoa. Is that you, Riley? Thought you were dead. I'm not. That's good. I suppose so. I need to talk to you about something. Out with it then. There is a young girl died over here by the lake. What time did you hear the gunshot? Around about 6:00, 6:15 in the morning. Just one gunshot? That's right. Did you, uh, come outside, look out the window? What for? Well, to see if everything was OK. I was OK. To see what the shot was about? Shots going off all the time around here. People hunt. They hunting all kind of things. Anything else? Yeah. About an hour later, I heard voices and a big crash. A crash like a car accident? No. Not like a car accident. More like glass breaking. And what about the voices? Male voices. Voices plural? What's plural? More than one. Yeah. Plural. But I didn't make out what they were saying so don't go on asking me what they were saying. Thank you. We good? Hey, Cinch. Word has it that she was headed north when she left the bar. That's your direction, ain't it? Where'd you go after the bar? Where were you between 12:00 and 8:00 AM? - Trying to pin this on me? - No. I'm just trying to get the story straight. You know, I'll tell you what. I left the bar with Shane and Fred here, went back to my house. That's where we stayed until I showed back up at work neck morning. Yo sweetie, you got to talk to Norman here whose shithead brother was sugar sweet on dear Abbey. I don't know what happened to Abbey. I know what you got on your hands is a conflict of interest. I gotta get back to work. He's in love. With Abbey? Yeah, with Abbey. He sure has a hell of a way of showing it. Yeah, well, he may act all tough and hard, but I'll tell you what, what's true about all men is they're flesh and blood and most of us are full of shit. Look, uh, why don't you head back to the ranch? I'd like to stay on if you... I do mind. Cinch is right. You're too close to this. And besides, don't look right. So go on. I'm sure your family's waiting for you. OK. He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his namesake. Yea though I walk in the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil. Thank you for coming. We really appreciate it. Still not Can you move? Excuse me. Would you watch him? What are you doing? What does it look like? Three years down the drain and you want to throw it all away now? It ain't been three years. God damn it. What a man does in his own home... - Hey Liam. - ...is his own business. You want to play a game? Yeah. Ah, come on. Damn it. Abbey never treated me this way. Well, Abbey's not here. Hey, you're pretty good at this. A regular shark. Uncle Ray. Yeah? I know why my mom died. You do? Three days ago, I wanted to go get ice cream, but she said no. Said she promised. She said she was too busy so I started crying. And I told her I hated her. So she got really mad and told me to go to my room. When I got there, I secretly wished for something. Hey, Ed. Hey, Ray. - Mind if I come in? - Sure. Thank you. Norman's probably stopped off at the house to check in on him, you know? He's a good boy. Yeah, he is. Well, that's all right. It's you I wanted to talk to anyhow. Oh yeah? Yeah. See too many things all happening in one night. And I'm not one for coincidences. OK. How about your tire that fell flat that same night. Hank said that you told him you thought it was retaliation for the fight. - You talked to Hank? - Yeah, of course. I talked to everybody. Right. Well, I never told Hank it was a retaliation for the fight. I might have just implied it. Oh. I don't know who done it, but I think it was someone with reason, someone pissed off and angry, maybe even jealous. Do you have any idea who that person would be? Evening, Ed. Hey, Norman. Can I get you something? No, no, no. I'm just... I'm just hanging out keeping Ray company. OK. Uh, you need any help with anything? No, I do not. You know, we're just going to let this sit for a little bit. Storm's coming and something's bound to turn up. Good night, boys. - Good night, Ed. - Good night, Ed. You tell him anything? No. He knows something. I don't know. Can't go around making accusations. You know that. You know, Ed, there's two kind of policemen in this world, man and time. Sometime you just got to let time do its thing. Can I help you with anything? No, I'm fine. No, I got it. I got it. Please, please, I got it. Found your earring at the bar. It was on the floor. Thanks. - It's Abbey's. - Oh. I wasn't looking forward to telling her I lost it. Guess now I don't have to. - Thank you. - Yeah. Frances. Woo! The separation of flesh and blood denotes violence in such a manner. But in receiving our roles, we thus become bound by the covenant. I want to say a toast. I'm glad that my daughter has found someone who'll be able to take care of her. I wish them health and happiness. To Frances and Norman. To Frances and Norman. This turkey is delicious. Did you cook this all by yourself, Mr. Campbell? No, that'd be Frances. Wow. Ain't Norm a lucky son of a gun. I know what you're thinking about that girl. Got to tell you she clears my mind. She's... she's so good to me. You know her and Abbey never got along. What are you doing? I'm just saying. You preaching? - This a sermon? - Never mind. Forget it. Your hands are just as dirty as mine, or did you forget? Jesus, Ray, don't start. You ever ask yourself why you did it? - You're drunk. - Did you? For you. I did it for you. Don't you forget it. Oh, well that's a good plan. Fuck you, Ray. That's right. Walk away like nothing's wrong, like nothing happened. You got a problem, Ray, don't put me in it, because I'm done shoveling your shit. You know we sit, we eat, and we smile at each other like all's just fine. Is everything all right? Come on. Let's go. Thanks for dinner. Congratulations. Living the dream, brother. Living the dream. What happened? Nothing. Come on. Let's go back inside before you catch something. 9, 8, 7, 6... You know this is the first year I got somebody to kiss on New Year's Eve. Norman. Hey. Have you seen Ray? I haven't heard from him all week. Nope. Would you tell him that I came by. Sure. Somebody please put that poor girl out of her misery. I honestly thought Ray had better sense than to just lead her on. Hello. What? Where'd you get this? Mr. Jensen found it. Says it was Abbey's. I'm sure it's your girl's. Ain't no other Abbey hereabouts. Abbey never engraved a key. Not saying she did. If it just said Abbey, I wouldn't be here. But the bow says To Abbey right in the middle of a heart. A girl don't go addressing gifts to herself. Abbey's keys were found in her car. I want to know why this one wasn't attached. I found it right nearabouts where she died. You come here asking for a reward? Go get my billfold. Don't muck things up. What are you doing? Why didn't you tell me you dropped Abbey's key? What the heck are you talking about? The one with her name written on it. Oh. Yeah. That one. - You piece of shit. - What the fuck. Don't give me that I don't care attitude, Ray. I don't. I don't care. I'm tired of lying. I'm tired of tracking what I said and when I said it so it fits fucking perfectly so that no one catches on. You know the last thing that went through my head when the car hit the bump? Pull the fucking trigger. You told me it was an accident. It was. That the gun just went off. It did, all right. We were just arguing, you know, a bullshit argument. That's all. Except now I got this story in my head, the what if, you know? What if I killed her? What if I meant it? And I don't want to believe it, but I can't fucking get rid of it, man. - I can't... - Shh. Ray. Listen to me. Ray, you didn't shoot Abbey on purpose, OK? I know it because that's not you, Ray. You hearing me? Look at me. You didn't, OK? Peoples think I did. No one thinks you did. They suspect me. What good would it do telling them now? We just heard it, Ray. This shit, it's ours. We have to deal with it. You should have taken me in. Don't lose that. That's what you should have done. What the hell? All right. You go get some sleep. Hey, I'm going to hang on to this for a while. Call me if you need anything. You can't go from house to house trying to find a lock that fits a key. That's against the law. That's breaking and entering. Well, maybe if you and Ed tried harder, I wouldn't have to break and enter. To do what you did tonight, I'd need a warrant. So get one. I need evidence. I'm a deputy, not a vigilante. I'm ready now. I wasn't before, but I am now. - For what? - To see it. The place she died. I want you to show me. Why? I need to see it. There is nothing to see there, Frances. What are you afraid of? What'd you mean? OK. You know what, I'm going to sleep in the trailer tonight. To Abbey. This is Abbey Campbell's? That's what I'm hoping to find out. Well, we got an engraving pen around here somewhere. But these letters aren't handmade. This is machine tooled. Machine? Yep. My machine doesn't do engraving. It won't work that. You may have to go someplace that can afford that equipment, city maybe. Greenfield, Jericho. That'd be like trying to find a needle in a haystack though. - Wish it was that easy. - What? Where you drop a stack of hay in a tub of water and the needle will fall to the bottom. The hay'll float on top. Hey? Well, ain't that something. Yeah. Then you end up with a pile of moldy hay. Thanks, Hank. Yeah. It's your last one and you can get out. Ray Young. How you been? You look kind of sad. He look sad, boys? Real sad. Looks kind of fucking moody if you ask me. Maybe he's on his period. Oh shit, Ray, you bleeding? Oh shit. Oy. That's a quick temper you got. It's your move. What's the matter, Ray, you off? What's still eating you after all this time? Hey Ray. - How you doing? - Fine. I heard there was an incident at the Whispering Pig again. - You here to take me In - No. I don't care about the fight. But it did get me to thinking about Abbey's car parked up by that lake. Did Norman ever tell you that it was a cover up? Botched up, but still, someone helped someone cover up the tracks, a meticulous someone. You ever see a gray wolf on a hunt? Can't say that I have. Alone they're not very skilled, just picking off berries and rodents. But you get them in a pack and they work together. Anyway, there is a sheep farm in Labelle owned by a fellow named Lenny Bendro. Now one winter Lenny had four lambs in two weeks gone missing. Vanished. All the traps he set were sprung. Nothing in them. So he finally he just he tied a sheep to a post. And he planted a ring of traps around her, far enough away that she wouldn't get hurt. That morning, when he came out and the sheep was there, she was unharmed, braying and screaming and all kind of hell. And not five feet away from her was a little wolf puppy in one of the traps. And standing next to him was his mama licking his wound. And Lenny saw that the wolf's leg was all gone to hell and there was nothing for it but to get it over with so he raised his rifle and he sighted in. Pew. And when he fired, the mama wolf leapt in front of her puppy. And she took the bullet in the neck. She was dead before she hit the ground. Bottom line is, when it comes to protection, nothing loves you like your own flesh and blood. You got something to tell me, Ray? Whatever it is, I can help you, son. Have a good night, Ed. I'm going to go pick up Liam from school. OK. You need anything from the grocery? No. - Want to come with me? - I'm OK. Hey. Hey. I was thinking we should go fishing. Little late in the day, isn't it? Lake will be nice. I see you go sometimes. Whoa, whoa. - Run and do your homework. - Fine. Frances. Fran? You need a doctor. They went fishing. France and your brother, they went fishing at the lake. OK. Another thing, back door needs a new lock. You know where the extra lock that was in the shed is? Ray broke the trailer one. Came home pissed drunk, couldn't find his keys. I had to replace it. I'm going to go get another one from Hank's. Hey, Ray? Can you watch my line? Gotta go to the bathroom. Come on. Let's go. Did Norman tell you, Ray? What? Where they found her car. Go on. We should... we shouldn't be here. Come on. I need to know. There's no mark, not even a cross. They usually put up a cross. You remember my ma? She had this chair in her room with this flower design on it, pink, yellow, all the things on her rocker. We used to sit and then she pushed back and forth while I was reading, just the two of us. But when her heart got weak, her legs got tired of pushing. My daddy took her off the rocker. The summer after she died, I used to sit in that chair for hours. It didn't matter how late it was. You know why I sat there? Because I couldn't help but think that maybe she overlooked something, that maybe she had missed something. And maybe if I sat there too, I'd figure it out. I know why you sit there, Ray. I know why you sit by that lake. Did you figure it out what you could have done? What you could have done differently. Frances. Ray. Frances? Hey. What happened? Just stay away from me. What the hell is going on? You tell me. What? What happened up here between Ray and my sister? Is there something Ray told you? He didn't have to tell me. It's written all over his face. And it's killing him. So just tell me. Tell you what? Did you know? Fran. Fran. It was an accident. I don't believe you. It was an accident, I swear. She wanted him to teach her how to shoot. She took your pop's gun. He was holding it. When the car went over a pothole, it went off, I swear. I don't believe you. Frances. Frances. How long have you known? The whole time. You knew the whole time. Frances, I'm taking you home. Stop. Don't. I'm taking you home. Get off me. Stop. Get off of me. Get off me. No. No. - Let go. - Frances. Let go. Let me out. - Let me out. - Frances. Frances, stop. No! Frances, stop. Frances, stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. He begged me, Fran. He begged me. What was I supposed to do? Ray's family. What am I? Any pain here? Well, you sprained it. We'll wrap it up. Give it six to eight weeks. There's something else. Tom. Tom, I'm sorry. Tom. Tom. Excuse me. Can I get the status on Frances Young? She's still in the room. I need to talk to her doctor. Please take a seat, Officer Young. Sir, sir, you cannot get back there that way. She came here with a hurt hand. What the heck is taking so long? She requested not to let you in. Tell her I'll be in the waiting room. You still here? Yeah. Still no luck? No. I've called every trophy place, locksmith in the entire state. Nobody's got any record of him. Lock it goes to is probably long gone anyhow. No. It ain't exactly what you'd call direct evidence. Nope. But it might put my mind at ease. Good night, Ed. Don't stay too late. Excuse me, ma'am. You have to sign out. Frances. Ma'am. Sir, you have to sign her out. Here. Sir, the paperwork. Frances. Frances, wait. I wrote down everything I did. It's all in there. I'm going to take it to Ed and I'm going to come clean. You can try and stop me. You can do whatever you want. OK. When was the last time that you and I went fishing? You're a horse woman, right? I own a few if that's what you mean. Yeah. You wouldn't happen to know where the Campbells... the auction house that the Campbells get their stock from. What auction house? Well, that would be Bill Tealer. - It's up in Carl Junction. - That's the one. He supplies most of the head north of Springfield. Are you looking to buy a horse? No. Thank you. How you doing? All right, sir. Did y'all make that key? Yes, sir, we did. Remember coming down here as kids? Yeah. It was good times, right? Well, at least we'll be together. In prison. We'll be together. They don't put cops with other prisoners. You're burning up. - I need a doctor. - No. No. No. No doctor. No. You're going to finish what I can't. You're going to kill that boy whose killed your sister and that other too. I love him. What's that? You pathetic girl. It's weakness made you what you are. No, Daddy, it made you. Hey now. Where are you going? Come back here. You hear me? Where are you going? Confess. Ray, don't do this. You don't have to. And you can't either. I corroborated your story, Ray. I'm implicated in whatever you say. Do you understand that? You don't have to turn yourself in. Just leave town. It don't matter where I'm at, Norm, because it's all up in here. How do you not get that? - Stop. - Ray. Just stop. Ray. Ray. Ray, stop. Are you hearing me, Ray? You hearing me, Ray? I'm hearing you. What do you want from me, man? I did everything you asked. I went to work, played family, I did it. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me! I've got nothing. I've got nothing. I ain't got no Abbey. Ain't got no wife. I got you. - Ray. - Don't. Ray. Ray. Ray, stop. Ray. What did you think was going to happen? You think Ed's going to go easy on you? You think you're getting off easy because you didn't mean it? Not now. Not after all this time. Ray. I can't let you get in that car, God damn it. Ray. You're making this so God damn difficult. Ray! I'll make it easy for you. You selfish fuck. You prick. God damn it, Ray. Ray. Ray! Ray! God damn it, Ray. Don't you do it. Ray, don't you do it. Ray! Ray? Sheriff. Miss Frances. You feeling all right? Just fine. Thank you. What can I do for you? Well, I'm looking for Ray. Do you know where he's at? Why? Because I want to Talk to him. Because I was hoping I wasn't too late. Sheriff. Yes. Have you talked to my daddy about being here, seeing it's his property and all? No. I guess I did not. I hear you can get in all kinds of trouble breaking and entering. Ain't that the truth. Hey, Ed. Hey, Norman. Ed was just wondering about Ray. Oh. Do you know when he's coming back? Ray? Yeah, Ray. I don't think Ray's coming back, Ed. You? I figured as much. Best be going. Subtitles by explosiveskull
