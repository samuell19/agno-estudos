(National Assembly) My third term as a politician, I was doing so well. 'Queen of Election, ' I was so popular. I am Seoul mayoral candidate, Joo Sang-sook. I reached the election, but lost... and I left politics... and live a life in seclusion. In the end, I returned to my granny's hometown. Why are scales so cumbersome today? So what? Don't want to make money? Gangwon Governor Cheon Dae-il, who received 3 years imprisonment for using confidential information... Those who sound like they will give you their organs during the election are the worst. Then pick a candidate who cherishes their organs. He is so self-centered, how could he govern us? Why are you lashing out at me? Must they pull this crap while eating our tax money? This is a secret, there is something called 'petulant' beside the heart, and behind that is 'glut'. You get a new one each term, so, on the third term, you get 3! - Hey! - What?! Are you really that busy? Right, it is sailfin sandfish season. You have to catch them then. Call me back after you get them, I will be waiting for you, bye! I keep losing members, why is that? I don't ever improve, why is that? Wrist snap, snap! I don't know, I have got to pee, mom. I will call you back, mom. Ocean is the same, but so different from Hawaii. What is that stench? Isn't that my little Pony?! - Brother! - Pony! Pony! Why didn't you call me from the airport? I didn't want to trouble you! You should have called! I wanted to surprise you! Good to see you, Man-soon. Sang-sook, you look so old. I never thought you would ever get old. Don't people who already look old don't get old? No, those people are always one step ahead. If not, they would be a babyface. Looking at these photos, you really got old fast. Your granny doesn't look that much older. But my bro looks so haggardly. My friends all thought he looked like Leonardo. Even Leonardo ages. My body is better though, I got nice abs too. He is like 47 now. (Election Analysis) Wow, crab! Was this caught with a fish trap? Sure, it is the least she can do. Unelected politicians are unemployable, am I right, honey? It is not like she was a judge, has nowhere to turn to, and has tons of debt. Returning home is the best. That is good. Say thank you for your hometown. My little Pony still talks so adorably. Pony, eat this, it is really hot. Honey, here. Oh my god. Look how sweet my brother is! What does it feel like to live with such a kind man? Why was I the only one, who recognized his kindness, why did it have to be me? Something like that. Pony should have met a man like me and gotten married. Why did it have to be that stupid Johnson! Forget it, Hawaii just was not me. Then will you stay with your mother... No, I am going to open a surf shop in Gangneung. Can I live here? - Are you serious? - Live here? Really? That means... I want to live together! Pony, that is amazing! Isn't it great, honey? I guess not. By the way, that Apgujeong apartment she sold for the election is now worth $4M. It went up again? I don't believe it! It was tough holding mom back, she blamed her for the downfall of our family. - Sang-sook, can I live... - You should definitely live here. Would you like the master bedroom? I would love that! You can live with us forever! Isn't that National Assembly? I have never seen it before. Stop trying to look like a hick. Those politician gold badges, are they real gold? Why would they be fake? They must be really expensive. Probably over $300. It is actually $35. 99% silver and 0.2g gold. I thought it was pure gold... Yes, it was pure gold initially, but that changed in 1981, saying it was a special treatment. I heard politicians get paid a ton, probably over $100,000, yeah? In the 80s... As of 2021, the standard salary is $152,800. How do you know all that? It is all on the internet. - Here is your key. - Thank you for the drive. Thank you. Hey, what did Mr. Park say? That is what Park said? No one will take me? He wanted your request to join the party to be a secret. Afraid of his party's reputation. Who took care of him when he was a rookie politician? Said you attacked your own party... On the blacklist... Doesn't want to step on poop... I am not the old me... I want to do so well... Crap... You are finished, he said. Revival is impossible. Someone do something! Oh no! Please help! Call 911, and throw him a tube. Where is the oxygen tank, bring me one! Does anyone know how to swim? Is this 911? A truck driven by a youth who worked overnight at the fish market fell into the ocean. When everyone panicked, one woman courageously jumped in. (Citizen Saves Truck Driver From Ocean) I thought I was dead. Then someone pulled me out. The lifesaver was none other than former politician Joo Sang-sook. Honey! Honey! Are you awake? Sang-sook... What? Am I badly injured? The time has come. Do you see? Is this a dream or real life? Where are my clothes? What do we do? Could you fetch me a taxi? How do I get home? How do I get home? There she is, it is Joo Sang-sook! How did you feel when you jumped? Did you know the depth was 6m? Were you afraid of dying at all? Someone had to do it if it was to save a man. Will you run for the governorship? Someone has to do it if it is for the people. (Throwing People's Truth Bomb Independent Joo Sang-sook) (Fish Market) Nice to see you. (Gangwon Governor) (Gangwon Governor Election: Unprecedented Neck and Neck Race) (Honest Candidate 2) (First Day in Office) You have a seminar at 2, move to Cheorwon at 3, and visit a military base guarding the border. I have prepared a medium size military uniform... Should I get a small one? Can my schedule... Is it too tight? Should I adjust it? No, make it even tighter - in 10-minute increments. - Yes, ma'am. Have a large size uniform ready. What is the status of documents to be sent to the North? (Director of Ministry of Culture) It is almost done, we are just finishing up. We have not even made contact. What was the response of the participants? (Manager, Agriculture) They are very positive. They are up in arms. All in-progress provincial projects will be re-evaluated. Have effectiveness analysis reports ready. Yes, ma'am! Re-evaluation... Did you come already? Director of Construction and Transportation. Cho Tae-joo, ma'am. Good to meet you. Wait, why is this... You need to push. Oh, this one is a push... It is my first day in the office... Excuse me, what is going on? I ordered them to change all doors to pull. But what for? The governor seemed to want to pull. Right, you work very fast. - You are the best... - This door is very smooth. Opens so well. (1 Month Later) Approved? Rejected? Really? Rejected again... (4 rejections: Conflict with regulations) (16 rejections: Financial burden) (21 rejections: Overlapping proposals) (35 rejections: Conflicting interests) 40 floors of 280㎡ homes? (Approved) Who would ever buy them? Excessive, too excessive. I will pick that up. I thought this Le Gangwon proposal was quite good. Good for the speculators. With respect, governor, I understand how things can get confusing early in your term, but you are rejecting all pre-approved construction projects. Whose idea was it to be so stubborn? Through thorough review... Excuse me. Those were approved during our meetings, then are we morons for approving them? With all due respect, councilors, so long as I am in the office, I won't allow reconstruction of perfectly fine sidewalks. I won't build useless bridges. I won't allow any window dressings. Is it wasting taxpayers' money? Are these pretending to do good work, only to stuff someone's pockets? I am so sorry... (Random Construction Halt) I will review them thoroughly! That is cheapening Gangwon lands... Please calm down! (Tears of Day Laborers) all of them will go through... extreme re-review! (Residential Housing on Verge of Collapse) (Joo, 'Review All Construction Proposals') Is everyone on it together? No one is answering. There is a reason why we are being careful. I will send a formal complaint to the media, who will only report on one side. No, that is not important. What is important is job creation and stabilizing housings. If you know that, why are you doing this? Pardon? What I am saying is, all that is possible if you serve consecutive terms. What? Consecutive terms? You are after clean slating any suspicious proposals. That is great, it really is, but even constructing a sports complex involves zoning, designing, and construction, it takes solid 3 years. With your remaining term, any new projects will only break the ground. You have to finish what you started, or the next governor will scrap what you did, and start over. Then whose song do we sing? Will this help the citizens? No way. 2 years is a short time to start anything. I have worked at this office for 18 years now. And you are the first governor with earnest intentions. Look at all these provincial projects, who will truly work for our people, and who will protect Gangwon? Who else will work like a bull like you? Bull? Yes, you have to get re-elected. You must first put out the fire. That is why I picked out a few potential projects. These will solve job and housing crises. Public housing? You saw this one before, Le Gangwon. You said only speculators would like this. That is why the developer made some revisions. In summary, if we give them high-rise apartment permits, they will build public housing. Yes, we provide the site, and give housings to the citizens at half price. It is good and all, but if we build those... speculators will swarm in. If we don't build them, there is no public housing. And the speculators will leave. We get landmarks. And the speculators are back. Jobs for citizens and housing stabilizes. Multi-purpose high-rises and public housing. We downsized it from 280㎡ to 60㎡, but from construction material and interiors, everything is the same. Since the ocean is that way, it won't get an ocean view... I am afraid of class disharmony if we downsize it that much. Disharmony? I bet people will love it even more. When these become landmarks, tourists will naturally congregate, they will take selfies, drink coffee, and spend money. That will lead to new jobs, better transportation, they all grow together. It all sounds great, but isn't 60㎡ still too small... Try living with a child. That space will fill up with a stroller and a few toys. Shouldn't it be 65㎡ at the minimum? Then let's go with 90㎡. 90㎡? But the construction budget will balloon... There won't be much profit, but it will create awareness that public housing is quite livable. While we are at it, I will show you the ocean view idea for all. That would be incredible. You are so broad-minded for a young man. Let's do it right, Mr. Kang. Thank you for the opportunity, Governor Joo. (3 Months in Office) For safe construction of Le Gangwon! (Le Gangwon Palace Groundbreaking Ceremony) (Gangwon and Le Gangwon Will Create Youth Jobs) - Le Gangwon! - Let's go! - Koh Gun-sik, you saved him... - Right, Koh Gun-sik. Attention, everyone! Governor! #1 in job creation, public satisfaction! Congratulations! Thank you! Let's toss her in the air! No way! One, two, wow! If you just ease off the restriction, we can be on schedule and budget. (6 Months in Office) Residents are just waiting for the closing date. These are on par with other provinces. - Approved! - Very nice! (Approved 50 projects, 100 projects, 200 projects) 1st in job performance! - Congratulations! - Congratulations! (1 Year in Office) 1st in local government rating! Congratulations. (1.5 Years in Office) Joo Sang-sook! Joo Sang-sook! You are the best! You are the best governor in the country! You must get re-elected for this province! Re-election! You have to do it! Joo Sang-sook for president! Joo Sang-sook! Joo Sang-sook! - Is my hair still standing? - It is like a hill. Not a mountain? Would you like to make it higher? Should I? (2 Years in Office) Hold on. Be honest now, isn't it a bit small? It looks like an adequate size for a structure that big. You are so clueless. It has to be big to win, and get media coverage. How about making it huge and gold-plating it? With fair weather, it will be seen in North Korea. Gold-plating it will cost over $100,000 at least. Didn't Gangneung propose a library, the one with a long name? Let's reject that. Kids nowadays don't get out much. What is the point of a stuffy library? A good nurturing policy allows kids to run wild on the beach. There are many ways to find a solution. When a giant squid gets erected here, kids will run on the beach to see it. They will get excited and run like hell. Genius, you are a genius! - Get rid of it. - Pardon? Where do you get these ideas? You are a genius. - One, two, three! - Squid! (Golden Squid Statue Opening Ceremony) - Golden squid! - Golden squid! - Good work, everyone! - Go away, shoo! Thank you, children! (2nd Le Gangwon Candidates) With the first Le Gangwon being a huge success, we may see speculators swarming in for the 2nd site. Please keep this information confidential until it is released. And I will take back the documents you saw here. - It is sensitive information. - It sure is. How is the Le Gangwon promo video going? Short $6 million, is that right? We are in negotiation with the Welfare, the senior center heating budget was decreased recently, it would be tough to do it again... Those people... Because we need to! Le Gangwon promo needs to be out before the election, so, people know what I did! I got a friend in the polling division, and pulled some strings... (Gangwon Governor Candidates Approval Ratings) 75%? In Gangwon, that means... You are incredible. If you announce the 2nd site, your 2nd term is a shoo-in. Her approval rating is the highest in history, that is a sure thing. Governor, forever! No need for that... Thanks to you, Gangwon will have a president soon. Yes, I understand. Ma'am, for Winter Championship, North's Sports Chairman, Lim Sun-hee made another condition. Seriously? How many times? She is a real psycho, what a hassle. Your 2nd term will be secured once we co-host this event. They are not helpful at all. I know, right? Why do they keep changing their minds? When I see her, I will punch her in the face! Investigate mass fish deaths! What is that? A ton of fish swept up on the beach in front of the Le Gangwon site. Could it be due to a change in ocean temperature? Should I ask the Ministry of Fisheries? No, let's not make a big deal out of it just before the election. - Stop ocean pollution! - Stop! Stop! Governor, one moment! I am so damn popular... - Yes? - Good afternoon. - Who... - You saved me from the ocean. - Oh Gun-sik. - Koh Gun-sik! What brings you here? I have something to show you. I am a little busy. I will be quick, just 1 minute, please. I made this pond with cement from work. - What is that? - Fish kept dying. I think something is wrong with the cement. Where did you get the cement? Le Gangwon. Have you told those guys? No, I was not sure, and I submitted this to the lab for analysis... Good, good, I will look into it. I really have to go. - But governor... - Very well, thank you. The election is right around the corner, what is up with those damn fish! I am sure we can find a solution... Hurry, hurry, this way! Come on, hurry! Move please, quickly! Don't dump them in one place, spread them out, please! Hurry, hurry! Spread them out here too. ( Protect Our Clean Ocean! - Zero Plastics In Ocean! ) As you can see, fish are getting sick due to plastics thrown out by tourists. I beg you to enjoy our beautiful Gangwon ocean cleanly. Sis! I want to live at my brother's official residence, are you okay? That is what he said? Yeah, I told her to come. I will live with her until the end. Why is my precious daughter living at someone else's home? If you didn't sell the Apgujeong home, she would not live with you. Of course, you can. Nice! They are so kind. A monk I know tells me to buy some land near Mt. Seorak, should I? You know what is best. That same monk read my boy's fortunes, and he is someone who will put anyone on a golden cushion. He is my son and all, but he is seemingly perfect. You must be so happy to live with my son. This was a great idea, it is a sure thing. I learn so much from you. This is what I do, governor. I think it was successful in blaming tourists... Then learn from it! You didn't even know AC was busted in this van. - It is cool if you do this. - Very cool. I picked up the trash, what is the point of this? We need to show that the ocean is clean even if the beach is not. What a hassle! Gift of nature, come see beautiful Gangwon province! - Good? - Yes, that is great. What is that? Skin is all peeled off. Am I going to die too? I highly doubt that. Governor, submerge, please! What are all these? Granny? Why is her photo here? My poor granny... (Letter of Wish From Granny) (Make her grow up) (and be kind.) (Please make her stop lying.) You are awake. Honey, are you awake? What a damn luck... What? Eh? Are you okay? Do you recognize us? Parasite. Speculator. What? What is with me? Did you just call him a parasite? Not again? You are the one leaching his blood all his life, and I am a speculator? I lost so much money because of you! Hey! Hey! What are you doing?! Hee-cheol! Hee-cheol! Someone save her! Is anyone there? Nurse! Please save my mom! Hee-cheol, are you dead? He is sleeping. My mom is the one who might die. This one fell out. Hee-cheol, what is with me again? The election is so close! Could it relapse if your immunity is weakened? Words are spewing out of your crap! Now you can't control your actions? Is this an upgrade? A sequel? I was finally getting comfortable, what is with you, Sang-sook! You are making me go nuts, shut up! You are always going nuts, but I am so calm! Your fault, your fault! (Governor's Day Begins) Hold on. Wait, it is a schedule alarm. What is my schedule? But it is locked. - I unlocked it. - How did you do it? Most patterns are circles and other basic shapes. You got a brain too. Oh no! - What is this? - What do we do? - Should I break my leg? - Should we? Want to die? Deputy governor Oh Jang-hwan's daughter Oh Jae-eun, and Gaundae Daily Kim Il's son Kim Gyu-min are here in matrimony, and giving this wedding speech is a great priv... privilege... (Survival rule 1: Think of something else) privilege... privilege, my crap, for me! - The governor is so pretty today. - Yes, of course. They come from highly regarded families, who are important assets to my government, and became close as golden parachutes. No wonder they didn't do any work, and focused on office romance! You guys are terrible, no work whatsoever! The governor is very witty today. She is absolutely hilarious. Marriage is a marathon. To reach the goal, one must support each other, and sacrifice. Yeah. If you think about it, she is quite right, yeah? But giving up halfway is an option too. A nasty personality can't be mended! Incurable, you can't fix that. I am so sorry! Definitely not us, we are doing great! Didn't you date someone in husbandry? Honey Motel, there. Why are you crying? Weren't you there at Honey Motel? Governor, could you finish up? Yes, I will finish up. A married couple! Does not! Become one! Never, fat chance! Let's dig in, groom and bride, march! (Presidential Residence) I wanted to know what it felt like to sit here. Oops, sorry, sorry. - Hello. - I heard so much about you. I am Sejong Mayor, who works on his feet. Gangwon Governor, who works with my tongue. The president is coming in. Busan already has an airport, why another? And Seoul doesn't have one? 13 million citizens of Gyeonggi province are desperate! Due to so many industrial accidents... (Please don't ask me...) With so many developments in the metro area, our people are crying blood! So annoying, right? So many demands, but no idea which to grant first. Then what should I do? The most logical thing, in Korean alphabetical order. She must be insane. Good, then you are up first. Do what? Something you really want. - P... - P? - No... - P... p... go on. Peace talk? - No, it is not that... - It is not that? Pr... Promotion for Gangwon! No... - P... - P... - R... - R... Why is he keep asking... R... - P... R... - P... R... - E... - E... (Survival rule 2: Pain is momentary.) Dammit! Is she sick? Does she want to run for president? It is okay, what a save. - Governor? - Yes? The president would like to see you. Not good. Governor. It is a very sturdy chair, waste of taxpayers' money? Waste? The upcoming Winter Championship... I closed the deal with the North to co-host the event. Amazing! Closed! Done! 2nd term! Where are you going? Do you love it this much? You are something! I am sorry. Make sure the signing ceremony goes without a hitch. Of course! Supreme Leader Kim is on the line. Let me talk to him, I will thank him too. Excuse me. It is me. But it is a closed deal... Again?! But... Can't... come? If you suddenly change your mind... Wait, please wait a moment. Christ... Here is the agreement. No... Hello? No, don't... Hello? Hello? If you do not talk... Why are you keep doing this? This just in, DEFCON 5 alert has been issued. Our military is on full alert while scanning North's actions. In addition, the cyber-attack on Gangwon is presumed to be from the North, and INFOCOM has been elevated to stage 1. We will connect you to the Ministry of Defense. (Gangwon Citizen's Daily) Hurry, let's go. Governor. You have to go. What? Go? - You have to go. - Right, go. Good afternoon. I am Gangwon governor, Joo Sang-sook. (Survival rule 3: Ignorance is bliss. ) - A good person may do good deeds. - After the North's provocation, the current administration issued Jindogae-1, and no reason for their provocation should ever be justified. Our military is preparing for any potential attacks. I am very disappointed by the actions of the North. I have a question. Why do you think only Gangwon is being hacked? Yes, it is good for neighbors to maintain healthy relationships. Ma'am, did you not hear my question? Yes, please believe me. Do you have a hearing problem? - Pardon? - Hearing, your hearing... Virility? Did she say 'virility'? Why are you asking me about my virility? No, I am talking about hearing, do you not hear me? No, we don't do it. It has been a long time. We are not sexually compatible, I hate it. I am not interested in your sex life, I asked you about your hearing. Are you deaf in both ears? If you hear us, raise your right hand! Governor! Excuse me! Hee-cheol. Man-sik filled me in, are you okay? - Virility... - Honey! Honey! Wake up! Don't die on me! - Please help! - Of course! Move! Out of the way! This is an emergency! I knew this would happen! I knew this would happen! Overworked, she is overworked! - One, two, three! - Go, go, go. Where is the nearest hospital? Where is the nearest hospital? Due to the governor's sudden health issues, I will continue the Q&A. - Yes? - How are you responding to the North's provocation? No matter how much we prepare, all our efforts are futile. What did he say? No matter how much we prepare, there won't be a war, it is all a lie. Bullcrap. I have seen this before. - Holy moly. - What is with him? It is all bull, all lies. Say what? Is it true that Gangwon's hack was related to the governor? This cyber-attack is totally related to Gangwon. The governor started swearing, and the North did so too, so, f-bombs were thrown from both sides! Back and forth! Snap out of it, snap out of it. Put her down, put her down. For this reason, our governor does not even feel any remorse over this matter. She has got a nasty personality, and cruel as crap! Who did she swear to? Why did she swear? What kind of profanity did she use exactly? What kind of profanity? - Stop him! No! - Mother... This concludes today's briefing... A case of double truth bombs? A good person may do good deeds... Hey, mom. What? Divorce? It is bad timing. Maybe when she is calm, she is too scary right now. I can't filter my words. They just come out of me like diarrhea. Resign. What? You worked me to death, and now you will throw me out? How are we supposed to work under the circumstances? And you wanted to quit! I read your resignation letter through your eyes. It is because you and that clown shunned me out! Who? Director Cho? Are you jealous? - Do I look nuts? - You punk! What?! Do you think you could have been here without me? And you? Could you have received such treatment without me? Treatment? Poor treatment, you mean? You are making a living because of me! I got you a gold badge! You hate me this much? Yes! And I hate your wig! It makes your head look huge! Hey! What? What are you doing? Dammit! - What are you doing? - Happy? Is that good? What a hot head! - Are you happy now? - You are a meanie! - Feels good? - You look so mean! She is coming! North's Lim Sun-hee is coming! The president convinced her himself! She is really coming? Yes, it took a lot of effort. The president also tasked you with a welcome speech. Will you be okay with the welcome speech? (Co-Hosting Agreement Ceremony) Sorry for all the difficulties. If you know, do it right. We will now hear the welcome speech from Gangwon governor, Joo Sang-sook. Good afternoon! To promote winter sports to Southeast Asia, (Survival rule 4: (Don't let the brain knows what the mouth is up to.) I prepared my speech in Thai. Which language is that? It is Thai, Thai. (Thai Press) There. To promote winter sports to Southeast Asia, I prepared my speech in Thai. Hee-cheol, I don't know what I am saying, but am I doing this right? You must not know what you are saying. You are doing great! Can't I just go home? If they don't leave, we can't go out of courtesy. Just keep eating, should I fetch you something? No, I got no appetite. - Maybe some Chinese seafood. - Chinese seafood... Ma'am, when did you learn to speak Thai? Don't talk to me. Comrade Joo, I have to tell you something. To me? I don't want to hear it. Let's have a chat over there. I don't want to... Hee-cheol! I was not going to tell you this, so, don't leak it outside, I need Park Bo-gum's autograph... Wait a minute... What kind of funny story are you two sharing? Governor really hated that you kept changing your mind, back and forth. What? No, he got it wrong! Are you nuts? When did I? You said she was like a psycho on the steps of our office! Right, I said when I meet her, I wanted to bonk her on the head. Not a bonk, but a punch. (Co-hosting of Winter Championship with North Korea Voided) ("I damn hate North Korea") (Gangwon Governor's Confession) (Public Enemy Joo Sang-sook) Despicable officials of South Korea disrespected our delegates with foam in their mouths. For causing grave sin to our great nation, peace on this peninsula will never be achieved! Honey, I can't go home today. Yeah, I am sure, I can't go. I saw granny underwater. You saw granny... - You saw her underwater? - Yeah. There is an afterlife. She is trolling us beyond the grave right now. Shouldn't our ancestors look out for our best? What about me? Why do I deserve this? Why you? Darn it, is this contagious? Holy cow, I am getting chills! I was just trying to help, this is so unfair, I was trying to help! Why are you doing this to me, granny? Forget it, as someone with experience in this, I am more or less an expert at this. I have my know-how. - We should... - What? - Bite. - Bite what? If we bite it, we can live without talking for a while. On my count of three, bite down, okay? One, two, three! - You didn't bite? - No... - Bite it! Go on! - I think it will hurt too much... - Bite down! - I am scared! Bite it on three! - One, two, three! - One, two, three! There is a live debate on the future value of Le Gangwon, and 100th anniversary of Children's Day ceremony. You will make an official announcement for running for the 2nd term. Yonhap, YTN, Gaundae Daily, and online outlets will be there. - Ms. Lee. - Yes? I am really under the weather right now, but I don't need a sick day. I got an urgent matter at home, but don't need to go... Fill out a vacation day form for me. I already got one ready for you. - Get him one too. - Already did. It is a bad situation, but 'vacation' has my heart fluttering. - Where are you going? - Vacation. - Not together? - No, goodbye, everyone! How is this vacation? More like a business trip. Now you are openly grumbling. Actually, speak up if you have any complaints. Let's be candid. - Be candid? - I am not a narrow-minded person. Not narrow-minded, but very anal. My heartburn is gone. - You are a thief. - What? Stop stealing my precious weekends. I am more comfortable alone, not lonely at all. I am more comfortable alone, not lonely at all. And stop asking me what I want for lunch. You are going to eat what you want anyway. "Let's eat this and your menu tomorrow." But lunch is now! There is no tomorrow! Lunch has to be eaten now! Why are you scolding me when the AC is broken? Did I break it? Am I your servant? And you told me to be honest, and I did, then you scold me for being honest, what the hell! (Resignation Letter) You are at fault. Why did you tell your underling to speak his mind? Underling? You are the same. You get scolded so much, but you never learn. "What do I do, Hee-cheol? What do I do, Hee-cheol?" I have had it, you always repeat things twice! Stop playing badminton and go earn your keep! - Hey, hey! - You know I am right! What do I do, Hee-cheol? What do I do, Hee-cheol? Stop repeating yourself! Stop it, let's go into hiding until the election. Once Le Gangwon finishes, we can win even with posters. Okay, I will take a photo for your poster. That sounds like a real plan. (Gangneung) Don't worry about it Don't worry about it - Our home changed so much. - I live my way My way I live in my way, - my way... - Hi! You actually came?

This is my home! - Honey! - Oops, Sang-sook. Pony, are you having your morning beer? On an empty stomach though? I will make you some fried eggs, Pony. - Thank you! - Stop with that Pony! Pony! Because you nicknamed her after a horse, our home is all messed up! It is stable now! What? Did you say 'stable'? Weren't you in Hawaii for only 3 years? What is with your weird accent? Are you trying to be funny? Then you are failing! Honey, you are being too harsh! Are you okay, Pony? That was hurtful... My heart is getting all scratched up. Sang-sook. Do you hate me that much? Honestly, I really do hate you. - What? - Eh? But I am jealous! I am so jealous of divorcees more than anything. If you ever want to remarry, please meet someone like him! Why did that sound offensive? Wait, Sang-sook, continue what you were saying! No! - Bro, don't hold me back! - No, don't go in there! Here, eat this, eat this! My little sister will die too. - I am starving to death. - Where is Man-sik? My sister-in-law is a bit sick. Are you on vacation? Why the shades in rain? And you? What if someone recognizes me? I am afraid someone might recognize you. Hey, Kwon-ja, I am outside your restaurant, I was going to get some lunch... What happened to this neighborhood? Did you close the restaurant? Why? It was perfectly fine. You got such bad luck. What? She is suffering from an illness where she can't filter her words. Moron, what a weird illness. They said the land value would drop. A crematorium was coming in. Crematorium? We didn't believe it at first. But the village foreman and the realtor said it was a real scoop. Everyone was rushing to sell before the announcement. But instead of the crematorium, Le Gangwon took its place? Everyone went nuts because the value shot up. The foreman got duped too. Fake news. Including me, everyone here was going to die. But we are fortunate though. We won the Le Gangwon lottery. As soon as I wake up, I check the value of the house. That is my only joy in life. Even if we lost our restaurant, who would have thought we would live there? Crematorium? Mr. Kang, do you know anything? You were afraid that speculators would swarm in if word got out. So, you selected the 2nd site in a hurry. There are many other weird things. A Le Gangwon worker came to us and said the cement was weird. - Right, Oh Gun-sik. - He is Koh Gun-sik. The cement is made by our subsidiary... You know we only use materials the Ministry of Environment approved. Right... There were many negative presses lately. Are you not well? It is not a fatal illness, but sometimes I want to die. That is bad, the election is coming up fast. You can't even rest on your vacation either. - Here, have this. - Herbal supplement! - Sang-sook, it is leaking. - What? What is leaking? I have to go, let's go. What? Does something smell? Hee-cheol, what is it? What is leaking? What the hell is leaking? Internal information is leaking. Kang already knows about Le Gangwon's 2nd site. What do you mean? That is bad, the election is coming up fast. (2nd Le Gangwon Candidates) You can't even rest on your vacation either. Herbal supplement! Wait a minute, I... Where are you going? Go back inside? I got something to check. No, it is dangerous. I left my sunglasses there. What? It is an expensive pair. No, your tongue is too cheap! Right... Please don't kill me! It is all my fault! Why did you have to be so nosy? Making ends meet is hard enough. I am so sorry! Please don't kill me! You can't admit to it already. Go easy on him, just a small scratch on his life. Yes, sir. It is my fault, it is all my fault! I could be out of a job, how could you eat right now? Mr. Park, if you have not eaten, please join us. Sure! Oh no, only 1 chair left, too bad. Too bad? - Isn't it good? - So good. You know any realtors - near Mt. Seorak? - Why? I want to get a feel of neighborhoods there. - Should I look into it? - How can you? Don't you know who I am? I am the chairman of Gangneung Badminton Association! I have a faster info network than most media outlets. People are just waiting for... Hey, it is Man-sik! What is with your neighborhood lately? It is understandable that you don't know, no worries. No clue? You have lived there for 10 years, but you don't know? Hey! It is Man-sik! Right, you said you don't know, sorry. Why bother with locals when you can get to the source? Hello? Is this Seorak Real Estate? My mother-in-law is retiring, so, we are thinking of selling our shop... Would there be any problems? You are being too cagey, just spill it. Sounds like everyone is moving out. - Why? - They say it is a secret, but a factory will be built, and pollution will get worse. These guys are conning the residents to shoo them away! - Right? - Don't want to. What? You are going to order me to find the mole who leaked to Kang. Don't want to do it. You said to call you weekends and holidays too. Vacuums get to rest when charging, but why do I get used nonstop? Because you are a broom. We will take care of this floor, please go downstairs! This stuff is bad for you, you can go! - Go! - Go! Let's try 1234. That is not it. What are some simple patterns? Number patterns... 5252, yeah. Dang, not it? 2828 then? What are you doing? We are disinfecting this floor, almost done here. Leave. - A bit more there... - Just go. Is that so? We will be off then. Careful! Hee-cheol! Dammit! Yes, hello? Yes. Darn it... What is this? 2580? Social Journal 2580? No, he can't be that just. Hold on, it could be a date. 0825, 0528. Thank you! (Date: May 28) 0528. What is this? (1st Stage? 2nd Stage? or 3rd Stage) (3rd Stage) What are these? Ma'am, why the Audit Commission all of sudden? Don't you find Kang's company a bit weird? They know all our confidential information. That is why I asked you to come. You have not felt anything weird about him? Not sure, I only met with his staff. Of course, you didn't know anything. You kept to yourself, how could you know? Hee-cheol, did you find anything? Yes, Sang-sook. From 3rd site, trams and roads, they got 5 years' worth plans all laid out. I think this is... (Planner: Cho Tae-joo) So? Who is the mole who leaked our internal docs? Can Le Gangwon finish on schedule? It is not a huge concern, sir. Are you okay, honey? She didn't suffer any wounds, she will be okay. Whenever she passes out, she gets new illnesses! I am getting nervous, so nervous! I am going to piss my pants off... Your next appointment is coming up shortly, sir. Let's move then. Looking for something? Are you looking for something? I forgot something here. This? Yes. Thank you... Did you find anything else? Tell me. Honey, are you okay? - Honey? - What? - Honey, I found it. - Found what? I think Cho is the mole. He caused the accident because he has been exposed. Cho? Son of a biscuit, I trusted him so much! This Cho? What the heck? Why are you here? You should have said he was in the next bed! That is not the problem right now. Did you really do it? Were you trying to kill Sang-sook? I think you misunderstood. Definitely a misunderstanding... Screw that. Should I make you stay here for good? Hee-cheol. Hee-cheol, I caught this scumbag, it is him, right? Sunobabich, wow cood yu, yu vastad! I don't think he is well. Hee-cheol, why do you talk like that? You bit it! Sag-sug, A din sae anihng. Good, I am so proud of you. I hope you are not like this for the rest of your life. Don't worry, I went to the ER. I will be fine when the anesthesia wears off. Good, you chose this tough path... When I bit down and drew blood, Kang said I was insane and let me go. Honey, I am scared... Why? How did you understand all that? Is this from a long work relationship? Not quite, we even got a traitor. Ya. - Where did he go? - Wer ee hee? - Did he run away?! - Cum on, maan, go eftr hem? Wait, wait! No need to chase him down. Is this the Audit Department? This is Governor Joo. I got something to report. Now? News? TV, get the TV remote. Okay. An anonymous tipster's video is making headlines this hour. The video contains Gangwon Governor Joo's double face. Tell them to decrease the senior welfare budget. Pull the heat allotment! Tell them to exercise! Putting money in welfare doesn't get any attention. Have to build something big to show that we work. That is the effectiveness of window dressing. They brought a truck full of trash in the middle of the night, and spread them out on the beach. It was clean before, I am told the governor ordered it. Perfect timing, we messed her up good. How are you feeling? Fine, I have to get to work as a civil servant. This country should reward you. You are so diligent. Thank you for the reading material. I bet you got close to her, do you feel bad for her? Do you, Mr. Kang? - Nope. - Me neither. We put you in that seat to carve out a rotten governor, but you became the worst of the bunch. The angle of the video is from Cho's view. Tell them to decrease the senior welfare budget. Pull the heat allotment! Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull! Tell them to exercise! Have to build something big to show that we work. That is the effectiveness of window dressing. He was a yes man but shot a hidden camera? Wy di A nu no it was hiddon camela? Du wei A cee it, Cho end Cang r du shame. Motherfather. Yeah, I am sure they like their mothers. No, motherfather. Yes, love their mothers. Yeah, moders. You said they are scheming together. Can't you expose them and lock them up? I want that more than anything. But we go no evidence and no witnesses. You said you saw a map in the office. Did you take a photo? Kand dake id, id wes Ae Rr. What? You can't take a photo with AR. Ya. Our country is so technologically advanced. Come on, there is no other way? If there was, would I be here? Shut your damn trap. Gun-sik, are you going home? Would you like some fish soup? No, I am okay. What is with your leg? - Are you injured? - It is nothing. What is it? - Get over here. - Is he hurt? Gon-seek, som ting wong? What happened to your face? Who did this? Why? Governor, could you come with me tomorrow? What? Are you okay? Yes... Do the can tongue twister. Can you can a can as a canner can can a can. What about woodchuck? How much wood would a... I actually can't do that one. - So, who is Koh Gun-sik? - Yes, that is me. Here is the cement analysis you requested. Lead, arsenic, and chromium compound. This is a scary list. How many times over the limit is this? Doctor, will this kill people? - Sure. - What?! Everyone dies in the end, this will just speed up the inevitable. Could you explain this plainly? When killing pests, you spray about this much. Bad quality cement contains about this much toxicity. The one you requested... - Wait, stop, stop! - No, I have to spray more. I think you can stop now. No, just a bit more. - Stop, stop, stop! - All done, all done. It is that toxic? I don't know what they used, but it is over 10 times the limit. Sons of biscuits, how do we catch them? It is no use, without strict regulations on cement, they will just pay a fine and that is it. If you have to use this cement, it should be only used on open roads, by the beach... Where did they go? Although I want to lock up Cho and Kang for using bad material to lower the cost, and exploiting my people, but without a piece of evidence, it is all a vain effort. Q4 2021 Cement Analysis Report What is important is rebuilding Le Gangwon from the ground up. That is the only way for victims like Kwon-ja. Found it, found it, found it! If a building is proved to cause serious environmental issues, the governor can order to have it demolished as per this act. Air pollution from coal... Okay. Or the cause of mass destruction of marine life. Marine life? Yeah, those fish all died with their skin peeled off. Which means the toxic substance trickled out to the ocean and killed them... Wait, so how do we prove that? The site is 200m away from the ocean. - That is so easy. - What? This is Le Gangwon. And this is a sewer, and this is the ocean. The site should already be polluted - because of the toxic substance. - Right. Then, rain starts to fall. When that happens, rain will flow past the site, and reach the sewer. And that water will flow out to the ocean. Then the fish living there will all die! So, what do we do? Pour fluorescein on Le Gangwon site. And when it rains, the fluorescent rainwater will flow into the ocean, and turn this region bright green. That will prove that Le Gangwon is connected to the ocean. Amazing! How is our little Pony so smart? I saw it on YouTube. What if it doesn't rain? Then fluorescein will dry up. A vain effort. Sorry to ask you a favor after not visiting in a while, but I need some water. Le Gangwon Palace They took my restaurant, and now that is all trash? - I am sorry, Kwon-ja. - For what? For everything. I was blinded by getting re-elected, I approved the project, gave it permission, eased regulations, and avoided the unjust public. I thought it only had to be me. I am so full of it, right? Do you know that? You are human trash. I am so sorry you became friends with human waste. You still got that tongue. But if you are the one who can go after those trashier than you, shouldn't you do it? You are still the governor. Here, it is all I got now. Do it right. - What is this? - Oh, that? Cho's cell phone. What? How did you get this? At the hospital, I guess he dropped it while running away. Why are you telling me this now? I unlocked it but there is nothing there. - You unlocked it? - Yeah. Who the hell are you? You are finally good at something! Come on, I am finally good at a lot of things. What is the pattern? Z', but why is it Z? I thought his last name was Cho. Cho Tae-joo? Am I right? Zo? Is it Zo Tae-joo? - Nothing special... - I told you, there is nothing. No evidence, no leverage, no one will take me seriously because of all the crap I pulled. I don't have ammunition to fight. Why did I live like this? At least you are honest. I am very honest right now, so, I will reveal my hand. I have Cho's cell phone, are you curious about what is in it? What is in it? All Gangwon land development information he leaked to you, and how you used that to drive its residents away, and your orders to use bad cement so that you can pocket the money, I thought he would have those in here as insurance, but it contains none of that. Let's hear your terms. Build Le Gangwon again. Damn, are you nuts? How will you handle the backlash if there is a problem later? There won't be. Even if there is, no one can prove it. We will drag it out in court for 5 years, and when it concludes, they will already be living there. Who speaks ill about their own apartment, fearing that the value will freefall. You are really smart. If this blows up, will those who protected you, continue to do so? Watch your back. Just a month before the election, incumbent Governor Joo's approval rating is plummeting... That is so sad... What will happen to the re-election? Another administration swap? I just got used to this. It happens all too often. Whoever comes in, - it is our job to do our best. - Thank you. Any words from Mr. Park? Stop, stop! The day is over, where are you going? - The thing is... - Good to see you, Mr. Foreman. We got stuck in traffic, we will unload quickly. Thank you! As a construction worker, you are so good at hoeing. But construction sites don't use hoes. Is this enough water? Don't we need a fire truck? What are you doing here? I am shoveling. Mr. Park, are you... Mr. Park! Do you know who I am?! Let go of me! What the hell are you doing?! - Governor... - Let go! Why did we come here after visiting the provincial office? What are we doing now? Shush, we are carrying out a mission. We are following that Cho Tae-joo guy. - That dickhead is our target? - Yup! This is so fun and exciting! Since Sang-sook is not around, I can use my American accent? Sure, of course, my little Pony. - Be confident! - I so wanted to use it! - Roll those 'R's! - Okay. - Who are those people? - I don't know. I checked it, and Cho's phone is empty. Yes, sir. Understood, sir. Hello? - Mr. Kang. - Good evening, Mr. Kang. I have something to show you, here. What is that? - Oh my, oh my... - That is so nasty! Nasty? I will make it look natural as an affair with Park. And a double suicide. Kang, why are you making such a big deal out of this? Killing a person is not an easy thing. Of course not. You can't clean this up! You absolutely can't! You have been acting like a lunatic, you are a ticking time bomb. - Mr. Kang... - Sir. I will start over from the very bottom, sir! I will devote my entire body, sir! Sir, please say something... Mr. Kang. Look at me. Look at me. All right, I will let one of you live. What? Whoever pushes first gets to live a bit longer. Okay? Whoever pushes first, then I could... Should I... push? I knew this would happen. It has been tough ever since we met, right? Same thing for me too. You are trash. Trash that you hoarded, and throw away when moving. Regular trash. - Trash? - Dammit! - Regular trash! - What?! Food scraps! Large trash that you need to pay to throw away! Governor. - Governor! - Yes? Please choose quickly, we have to clock out. Please don't kill me. If I become the president, I will make you the head of security. She is not worthy to be one. I will volunteer here all my life without any pay. - Without any pay? - Yes, free, absolutely free. But you love money so much! - I like money, I really do! - I know you do! - But I can like Mr. Kang more! - What a load of rubbish! - What is that? - I will love him! Boss, isn't that our vehicle? Owner of 4579, your car is on fire! Who the hell is that jackass? Owner of 4579, your car is on fire! - Koh Gun-sik. - Get him! - Let's move! - Koh Gun-sik... Isn't he the Le Gangwon scumbag? I think so, sir. - Go? - Run, run! Be quiet! Christ... Uh, you are going to fall! What do I do?! I can't hold on any longer! Come grab him, your boss is going to fall! Come grab him! Run, run, go! Move! We are on the ground now... - We have to be quiet. - What? Be quiet! Honey! Honey! That guy, Oh Gun-sik? He called me! He said you were kidnapped! - Are you okay? - Just go... - I was so worried! - Just go! What? Happy to see me? - I am happy too! - Be quiet! Who dares to kidnap my wife! - Who is he? - Probably not them. I hope it is not them. - Piss off! - Be quiet! Why do you keep shooing me away?! Five of you? That is why you told me to piss off? Go get them! You are so clueless! You should have said there were five! Governor, get in! Hurry, hurry! Go, go, go! Get them! Man-sik, your butt... - Could you stop fidgeting? - Wait a minute. Hee-cheol, would you like to sit on my lap instead? This is really uncomfortable. That is why you should stop fidgeting! Would you like to swap with me? No, young man, thank you for everything. Drop us off and get going, the rest is up to us. From ex-vice minister to director of Transport Ministry? I am going to lock these jackasses up today! That is my wife, she is the big man! He flattened my tire, Koh Gun-sik is dead! Your call cannot be connected, please leave a message. (Ashtray) Move out! He is closing, let's go. Pony, it will be dangerous, you stay right here. - Wait! Wait! Please! - Wait a minute! I am the governor, and this is my chief of staff. Governor, you are here. Good evening, please go ahead. You are doing great work. Thank you, let's go. - Huh? - No sportswear, sir. I am the chairman of Gangneung Badminton Association. I am here as an athletic rep. We have a strict dress code, sir. Let me use the washroom. Not even the washroom. You are putting me in a spot. My apologies for the long wait! This is the head of Gyeonggi construction, who will lead our new project. I am Park Won-tae, good to meet you all. This is a manager of MH Construction. Please leave any site and surrounding problems to MH. Very reassuring! We have a VIP guest, Vice Minister of Transportation. Good to meet you, I hear Gyeonggi is quite rowdy. Yes, it is not quaint. Oh my, I am late, my apologies! Mr. Kang is here. He is the head of Gyeonggi construction. So good to meet you, my anticipation level is high. - Please sit down. - Yes, sir. - Sit comfortably. - Good, good. He is so handsome. When a new Gyeonggi governor is appointed, we get to work. Ratings will freefall with pressure from the assembly and media. They will get very anxious. That is when Mr. Park becomes their right-hand man, and throw a bait. "This will solve job creation, housing crises." Here we go! - Le Gyeonggi! - Thank you. They are after Gyeonggi now? And just put them in front of me, game over. Then let's go with 90㎡. I will take care of sweet talking them, and empty the site before the announcement. Then we start a rumor that a crematorium or a power plant will be built in the area. These villagers are so naive that they will go crazy if you say it is a scoop from the government. These guys are all crooks! Profit sharing afterward will be 50-50 in cryptos. You will get a free penthouse too. Sit down! It is 8 guys against 2 of us! - For Le Gyeonggi! - Gyeonggi! Huh? What is that? Oh no, did they see us? What is that? Isn't that Le Gangwon? Why is Le Gangwon... on fire? Damn it! They left, they left. What is going on? How is that on fire? How shabbily did you build that? Where did you spend all the construction budget? The media will have a field day, blaming the shoddy construction. We covered for you with the cement problem! Did you mess with exterior materials too? How much did you embezzle, Kang! Did you backstab us? Say something! Hold on, please. Sir, I think there is something wrong with the material. It doesn't matter about that, were you honestly going to live there? You were going to sell it when the value shot up. Even so, this is plain wrong. Who will take responsibility when this gets out? You are talking about responsibility now? You all and I are cut from the same cloth! How are we the same?! We did some greasing to get the work going, Mr. Kang. Have you seen a working car without grease? I paid you hundreds of thousands to run that car. I risked my life on the line! And we risked our government's job to help you, jackass! They are supposed to be proud of what they did? Sang-sook, stop! Hey, hey, hey! Because of jackasses like you, We, civil servants, are getting a bad rap! That damn mouth of hers. What are you doing? Get that out of my face! How did you get in here?! Are you surprised that I am not dead? Governor, a public official must not act like this. Get back, get back! You guys watch it, I am shooting everyone. You gained illegal entry, and filming without permission! Do your damn job! - Give me your phone! - Don't you dare! Leaving already? You should party a bit more. Man-sik, how did you get in? That idiot checked out. Look, he is trying to run away! - Hee-cheol! - Yeah? Make way, please, so sorry about this. He majored in physical education. It is not a joke. I dare you to come down. Do you know what my specialty is? Jump smash! Get over here, come here! Governor! Governor! Cho Tae-joo! Get over here! Stay back! Don't hit me, I won't hold back! You gangster! I said I won't hold back! Get over there, jackass! Come here. You leaked internal intel for money? Did it feel good to pocket people's money? It sure did! Civil servants like money too. We are only human! A human must never do that! Stay right there! Governor! Give me your phone. You little punk, say it again respectfully. Don't be like that. Even if we start over, the next governor will side with us. Just beg, who knows, we might help your election. Seriously? That is okay, though. Many others will do a better job than me. I will chop all of your heads so that they can do their jobs! - You are finished. - It is far from finished. Ever seen us construction guys go under? No. Die, die! Die, die! I won't die alone. Governor! I can't swim! Please help! Granny. Is this really the end? We received a complaint. Come on, man, we weren't fighting! Keep this up, and I will add an obstruction of justice charge. We are all civil servants too. Let's go talk at the station. I know the police commissioner well. Let's get going. Honey, are you okay? Honey, honey! Stop shaking me! How could I be okay? You passed out, you must have hit something. My phone, my phone... Where is my cell phone? My phone! My phone must be underwater... My evidence... Dammit! But even so... We have to get that jackass... Just look at his smirk. We have to let him go for not having any evidence? That is not fair... Are you all right? - Hee-cheol. - Yes? What if there is a walking hidden camera? What? - Come here! - You scumbag! What is it? Can't you clue me in too? Sang-sook! Mr. Park! Where were you? - Man-sik! - What? - We did it, we did it! - Did what? Fire trucks dumped so much water! So what? What did that do? What the... You are so thick... What? The fluorescent water found in Namhae Sea originated from the Le Gangwon site that traveled through the sewer. This proves that mass death of fish was related to Le Gangwon, and it is the source of serious environment pollution. The fire that engulfed Le Gangwon last night was the result of a cigarette fire. Using flammable material with Dryvit construction method helped spread the fire instantly. A pile of evidence relating to Le Gangwon corruption was discovered. The police found cash, spy camera glasses, and video files from a secret cottage of a Gangwon director. CEO of Le Gangwon developer and current high-ranking civil servants are being accused of using internal information to buy up lands of the site, before they are unannounced, thereby pocketing millions of dollars. Governor Joo, who stated that she won't be seeking 2nd term, has released a statement concerning this case. I deserve to get all the hate. You all elected me because you thought I would be a good governor, but I only defaced your trust. But I will rebuild Le Gangwon no matter what. Even if I have to confiscate their fortunes, amassed by extorting you all, I will resolve this problem. Please accept... my sincere apology. See? That is my friend. (A year later) Let's get going. Man, oh, man. - Good afternoon, gents. - Off to lunch? Don't you think people are avoiding us lately? They definitely are. Did you come today as well? Of course, I have to come and supervise. You got yourself a perm. I hope you didn't pay money for that. - Sorry... - Does it look that bad? Which hair salon? So I can avoid it. Wearing a hat won't cover it up. Gun-sik! Sorry for being honest! He will avoid us now. Why isn't our illness going away? Tell me, Mr. Anally Honest. Granny must still be angry with us. She still can't trust us? Are we on probation or something? I want to lie so badly. One sec. Yes? The Presidential residence? Do they want you as a minister? I am occupied until the construction of the Gangwon Village finishes. Is it the Ministry of Environment? The Ministry of Environment? What? The Ministry of Unification? Unification? Why? Why? But why am I... Recommendation from the North? They liked my frankness. - Sang-sook. - Yeah? I am going home, bye! Where are you going? Don't go! (Honest Candidate 2) (Park Jin-ju) (Seo Hyeon-u) (Yoon Kyeong-ho) (Gim Mu-yeol) (Ra Mi-ran) (1 Month After the Appointment of Minister of Unification) What if I start World War 3? What have I done on the world history? Which stock should we buy? Defense industry? Airline industry? Or just stock up on gold? Honey, this is a God-given opportunity. It is an opportunity for you to die! Wait, honey, I think you are worked up... An opportunity for you to die! (Directed by Chang You-jeong)
