Hey, hey! ♪ Remember when ♪ Hey, Amber. Are you ready? Seriously, Mom? I've been waiting forever. ♪ There was a time when things seemed so pure ♪ Come on, Mom. ♪ Then we had to shade it, I feel jaded, mind's not made up yet ♪ Oh, my God. ♪ We should know better ♪ Mom, what are you doing in my room? I'm going to borrow this. What do you think? Do you really want to know what I think? Not anymore. I think I'm the only kid in school whose mom still dresses like she's a teenager. Ouch. God. Hey. Mom, can you just wear your own clothes? I bought these clothes. So, technically, they're all mine. I know, but it's embarrassing. Well, jeez. If it bothers you that much, I'll put it back. You know, it's. Okay, it's fine. Just take it. It'll look fresh on you. That's a good thing, right? Yeah. We're going to be late, Mom. Mom? What are you doing? You're not wearing those to school. Were you going through my bag? Honey, they look like they were painted on. You're avoiding the question. This is my house, my rules. So, change your pants. You're not wearing those. Technically, it's Dad's house, right? Don't be smart. Put these on. We're going to be late. Whatever, Mom. Amber. Amber? Oh, my God! Hi. It feels like years since we've seen each other. I know. So, how was the trip? I saw your pics. It was great, except for my mom's bikini. I thought she looked pretty hot. No. I wish my mom was as cool as yours. Mine's such a prude. It's so weird to believe that they've been besties since high school. Yeah, I know. She's not as cool as you think. Okay. Hey, are you going to Jackson's party tonight? You know my mom's not going to let me. It's a school night. Just tell her you have a report or something that we need to do and you can stay at my place. No. She's too smart to fall for that. Okay. Then sneak out. And get busted? It's always better to ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission. Maybe with your mother, but not with mine. Just come. She's crazy. You're crazy. I missed you. I missed you. Hey. Hey. I got you your usual. I'd rather have what you're having. You don't need it. I do. Why? What's going on? Sean's been calling. So? He wants to spend more time with Kelly. Well, he is her dad. No. He is a lying, dirty cheat. Yeah? Well, at least he's around. We're better off without him. No. You're better off without him. But trust me, Kelly's better off having him around. Who's that? That is Ben Ellison. He's a client. I'll call him back. A client or a client with benefits? I am trying not to mix business with pleasure these days. Oh, that's never stopped you before. Well, it didn't end so well last time. Besides, he's a lawyer. The suit-and-tie guys aren't my type. Oh. So, he's old? I didn't say that. He's not. What's going on? I saw a text on Kelly's phone. I think she's seeing someone. You went through her phone? She doesn't tell me anything anymore. And also, I just don't like the fact that she's hiding things from me. You've got to relax. Remember when we were kids? You didn't want anything to do with your mom. That was you. Well, whatever. You can't keep them from growing up. We can only try to be their friends and hope they take our advice. I'm not ready to let her go. Well, you have to. You're just going to end up pushing her away. And besides, she is going to want her mommy again very soon. Oh, really? When's that? When she has kids and wants you to babysit. Not helping. Yeah. I cannot believe you met someone over the summer, either. I know. So, what's your guy like? Alex? Yeah. He's amazing. He's just not like the other guys at school. He's actually mature. I think I'm falling in love with him. That's exactly how I feel about Zander. Really? Yeah. He's deep. Like, he actually listens and cares about what I think. That's so good. Have you guys done it yet? No. No. We've only been dating, like, a couple of weeks. Wait. Why? Have you? No, you haven't. Oh, my God. When? Over the weekend. He told me that he loved me, that I was the one. That's huge. I know, right? Wait, wait. So, what? Did you tell your mom? Are you crazy? She'd kill me. She doesn't even know I'm on the pill. What? Zander took me to one of those free clinics to get them. But promise me that you won't say anything, okay? I don't need your mom letting it slip to mine. I promise. Your secret's safe with me. Come on. You're my bestie. Okay? Okay. Oh, that's my dad. I have to go. Bye, babe. Bye. Can't wait to meet Alex. Bring him to the party, okay? Okay. Text me later to make plans? Duh, bye. Bye. Hey, need a ride? I wasn't sure you were coming. Yeah. I got caught up at the bar. Some safety inspection or something. Ah. God, you are beautiful. You know that? Get in. So. So? You said you had something special planned. Did I? Yeah, you did. So, where are we going? That, little lady, is what we call in the biz a surprise. Oh, God. Mom? Hi, sweetie. Dad's outside. He wants to talk to you. What does he want? I don't know. I guess you're actually going to have to talk to him to find out. I thought we talked about you coming over uninvited. Kelly invited me. That's not the same thing, and you know it. Why don't you just try to be nice to him? Honey, don't make me the bad guy here. Well, don't put me in the middle of your irreconcilable differences. What do you want? You aren't returning my calls. I just want to talk. That's because there's nothing to talk about. I think it would be better for Kelly if I spent more time with her. You don't get to tell me what's best for my daughter. Our daughter. You know what? None of this was interesting to you while you were screwing that bimbo. Now, all of a sudden she dumps you, and you want to come by and start playing daddy again? I'm just trying to do what's right for Kelly. I'll think about it. Thank you. And the next time you want to talk, you call my lawyer. I got something for you. Oh, really? Ta-da! Oh, it's so beautiful. You like it? I love it. Thank you. Good. I wanted to get you something unique, just like you. Come here. Oh, who's that? Oh, she's nobody. Come here. You okay? What's wrong? Yeah, I... It's nothing. Okay. Wait. Wait? For what? You like me, right? Yeah. Okay. So, let's get to know each other a little better. What do you mean? You know what I mean. Come here. Look. What are you doing? Baby, we love each other, right? Yeah. Okay. Let's just show it. Look, I don't... No, please. Stop. Stop! You know what? Actually, I don't want to do this. You don't want to do this? Okay. Right, right. I didn't think you were a tease, but I guess you are. I want to go home, now. Okay, fine. Let's go home. I can't believe you. Is everything okay? Oh, yeah. You sure? Baby, what's wrong? Did something happen? I broke up with him. Oh, honey, I'm sorry. I thought he loved me. I'm so stupid. He was an idiot and he doesn't deserve you. I know you think I don't understand, but I do. I was a teenager once too, you know. In fact, some people think I still dress like one. Funny. Did Alex give that to you? Mm-hmm. Didn't you say there was a back-to-school party tonight? Yeah, but I don't really want to go. Let's get you cleaned up so you can go. No, no. I don't want to go. Sitting at home is not going to help you. You should go, try to have some fun. Forget about that boy. Okay. You're not so bad after all, Mom. Oh, that's sweet. Thank you. I love you. I love you, too. Amber? Hey. You look amazing. You do, too. Oh, my God! Come on. Zander's here. I cannot wait to introduce you. You're going to love him. Zander, babe, this is Amber. We've been best friends since kindergarten. What's wrong? What's wrong? He's Alex. He was my boyfriend. What? You two were dating? I mean, kind of. You said you cared about me. Yeah. But I never said we were exclusive, so... Are you kidding? You're a pig. You're disgusting. Come on. Amber, I didn't know. Wait up. Amber, I didn't know, okay? I'm sorry. He said he was in love with me. Seriously? Yeah. He's a jerk. I'm going to dump him. He's definitely not worth us losing our friendship over, right? Right, yeah. Let's just go. Uh, okay. Hey. I'll see you later? Hey. Do you want to come over and watch a movie and eat a tub of ice cream or something? That sounds great, but I can't. I have a book report due. But rain check, right? Okay. Okay. Yeah, sure. Yeah? Okay, bye. Okay, bye. You girls home? Hey. Hi. Where's Kelly? I don't know. She couldn't come over. She had to go home and work on a book report or something. That's strange. I could have sworn Heather said Kelly was coming over here to do that. I must have misunderstood. Okay. You know she's nothing like you, right? You're super mature for your age. You good? Yeah. Hey, why didn't you call me back? I texted you a million times. My cellphone died. You were with him, weren't you? I can't believe you don't care he was two-timing us. Zander said that he just wasn't that into you. And you believed him? Why would I lie to you? I don't know. Maybe you're just jealous. That's him, isn't it? You slept with him last night, didn't you? Let go of me. You're just jealous that he likes me better than you. Hey! Get off of me. I want to see what he said. Leave me alone! Get off of me. Give me your phone! Amber! Get off. Give me your phone. Stop it! Stop! All right, all right. Break it up. Break it up. Break it up. Come on, you two. Break it up. Amber. Amber. All right, come on. Let's go. Let's go. You guys are coming with me. Come on. As you know, our school has a strict no-bullying policy. As it is their first offence, and while it's completely out of character for them, I'm going to turn a blind eye this time. But it can't happen again or else I'll have no choice but to suspend them both. I don't even know how this happened. I mean, they're usually so close. We can assure you, this will never happen again. Thank you. Thank you. What happened? Maybe you should talk to Kelly. She's the one who's been sleeping with my boyfriend. Kelly, is that true? I can't believe you just did that. You promised. Yeah. Well, you should have thought about that before you slept with him again. Amber, that's enough. She's your best friend. Not anymore. All right. Well, I don't know who this boy is, but it's over. Right now. Do you understand me? I hate you. Yeah. The feeling's mutual. I don't believe this. I know. What a mess. No, it's not just that. She's been lying to me about everything. She's out there having sex with some guy? Look. You can't beat yourself up about it. They're growing up. You know, maybe you're all right with you daughter messing around at this age, but that's not how I'm raising my girl. Excuse me? I should never have let her hang out with Amber. I knew she would be a bad influence. Wait a minute. You're blaming Amber for this? She's not getting it from me. You know what? You're pissed off at your kid, you point it at her. Don't point it at Amber, and don't point it at me. Things are going to be different around here from now on. All right? It's obvious I can't trust you. So, there will be no more lying, no more sneaking around. You will go straight to school and come straight home afterwards. You're overreacting. Look at me! All right? You have no idea what men are like. This isn't like you and Dad. Zander is different, Mom. They are all the same, sweetie. I am only doing what is best for you, and I will not let you throw your friendship away over some boy. I'm keeping this. Mom, come on! You get it back when you show me that I can trust you again. You know, if you're going to be mad at someone, it should be Alex, not Kelly. What? You don't think I should be mad at Kelly? Are you kidding me? I didn't say that. I just don't think this guy is worth losing your best friend over. Okay. Then what am I supposed to do? When I was your age, there was this boy in school. He was so hot. Ew. But he was a player, just like your guy, and he played me. He messed around with my best friend while I was gone. She didn't go to the same school, though, so she had no idea. But when I found out, I was so mad. Because I was with him first, you know? So, then what did you do? I messed around with him after I found out. Because I was a stupid teenager, and being stupid is part of being a teenager. But I still wish, to this day, that I hadn't done that, because I lost her as a best friend. And I bet if you give Kelly enough time, you'll find that she feels the same way, too. Love is a precious thing. But it's also a vicious thing. And as precious as you are, you're still a tough little cookie. Just like me. Why don't you get some sleep? Everything will look brighter in the morning. I love you. I love you, baby. Would you come with me, please? Why? What's going on? Just come with me. Have a seat. Hey. Hold up. Hey. Hey, let me give you a hand with that. No, I got it. I know, but I want to help. Oh, thank you. There you go. There you go. All set for your next victim. Is that courtroom humor? Well, I might be a defense attorney, but I'm not without my charms. Well, I can see that. Listen, I still have some papers for you to sign at the office. Or, you know, maybe we could sign them over dinner tonight? Hold that thought. Sorry. Hello? Speaking. Wait. What is this about? Yeah, okay. You have my permission. Is everything okay? The police want permission to talk to my daughter. Where is she? She's at school. Well, I'm sure it's nothing. But here's my card. My cell number's right there. Thank you. This is Detective John Grayson. Hi. Which one of you is Amber? That's me. You're Kelly? Yeah. We understand the two of you know Alexander Cosgrove. Yeah. Yes. Please wait outside. So, the cops came by the school asking questions about Alex. Yeah. He said that he fell down the concrete stairs at the reservoir where we were the other day, and he's in the hospital. He's in a coma. What I don't understand is why they're asking you questions. I don't know. They're asking Kelly stuff, too. Like what? Like, how I met him and if I know any of his friends and just stuff like that. And what'd you tell them? I met him on the internet, and I don't know any of his friends, so... You met him online? I told you that already. No, you didn't. Honey, come on. That's dangerous. Mom, what year are you living in? What about Kelly? What are they asking her? The same sort of stuff. We both met him the same way. He played us like idiots. It's all right, honey. And Alex is going to be okay. Yeah. Can I please go now? Yeah, okay. Peace offering? I am so sorry for the awful things I said to you yesterday. Don't even worry about it. I know all that threw you for a loop. I get it. You're an amazing friend, you know that? And I will not let Kelly and Amber's fighting get between us again. This is crazy with that whole Alex thing, though, huh? How do you mean? Just everything, you know? With the girls and the cops and Alex in a coma. No. Kelly said they asked her a few questions. She didn't say anything about a coma. That's what this whole thing's about. Kelly didn't say anything to you? No. Sean picked her up after school. Yeah. The police said that Alex was in an accident at some reservoir, and he's in the hospital. Did they say what happened? Just that he fell down a bunch of concrete steps. He's in really bad shape. Why are they questioning the girls, though? See, that's the part I don't understand. It's bugging me. Do they think they're involved? Amber didn't say anything to that effect, but... You know, I should go. I want to talk to Kelly when Sean brings her home. We're okay, though, right? Yes, of course we are. Lisa Mitchell. This is Detective John Grayson. Are you the one that was at the girls' school this morning? Correct. I need you and Amber to come down to the 51st precinct. When? Now? I'm afraid so. It won't take long. Okay. We'll be right there. What was all that about? They want Amber and I to come down to the station. Looks like we're all going in. Hello? It's all right, sweetie. We're almost done. We are almost done, aren't we? So, you and your daughter went home directly after the incident in front of the school? Yes. And then what? We went to bed early. All of that arguing really wore us out. I think we were both fast asleep by 11:00. And you didn't hear from Amber the rest of the night? No. She was really mad. I've never seen her like that. Is there anything else you may be able to recall that would help us with the investigation? Not off the top of my head, but if we think of something we'll call you. Won't we, sweetie? Sure. Hey. What's going on? They wanted to ask more questions. Go over alibi again, all that kind of stuff. I'm going to take her home, all right? I'll call you in a little bit? Yeah. Mrs. Mitchell? Ms. Mitchell, actually. Ah. I apologize. John Grayson. Would you two come with me? Right this way. Yeah, sure. Come in, please. I appreciate you coming down here. I'd really like to know what this is about. Well, we have a young man in a coma. No. I'm aware of that part. But what are we all doing here? You're a homicide detective. Well, we have several reasons to believe it was no accident, and we're trying to get ahead of it in case Alex doesn't pull through. Is he going to die? That is an unfortunate possibility. So, are you saying someone pushed him or something? You mentioned that you'd only been dating a few weeks. Is that right? Mm-hmm. Are you still seeing him? No. We broke up. Kelly mentioned that you two had been in a big fight at school. Yeah. I found out he was seeing her, too. Ah. I'm guessing you were pretty upset about that. She's my best friend. Wouldn't you be? Probably made you pretty mad, too. I'm sorry. What does this have to do with anything? Well, I asked Kelly the same kinds of questions. Kelly mentioned that Alex took her up to that reservoir a lot. Something about it being his special place. Did he ever take you up there? Wait. Are you lining up suspects? I'm running a preliminary investigation into a very serious incident, which may end up being a murder. So, can you tell me where you were around midnight last night? She was at home with me all night, detective. Nuh-uh. I need Amber to answer that question. Amber? Hold on. Do we need a lawyer? I don't know. Do you? Were you angry? Stop it. Did you see him last night? Stop it. Did you push him? Stop it! Excuse me. Mom, what's going on? I have no idea. Grayson. Yeah. Thanks. Alexander Cosgrove just died. This is now a homicide investigation. He wouldn't stop. It was like he was trying to get a confession out of her. But why would he do that? She didn't do anything. Well, it's their job to cross everyone off that list as fast as they can. It's not a personal thing. So, now what? Amber was home when it happened? Yeah. Are you positive? Well, I wasn't following her around the house, but she was here. And there's no other way she could be involved? None. Then she'll be eliminated as a suspect. That's all. What the... The police just pulled up in front of my house. Okay. I'll get there as fast as I can. No one gets in without a search warrant, all right? Okay. What is this? I'm afraid we're going to have to ask you to let us in to search your house. For what? Possible evidence in the murder of Alex Cosgrove. You're not setting one foot inside that house without a search warrant. My lawyer is on his way. He's going to want to look at this before you come in. I'm afraid that's not how it works. Mom, what's going on? It's okay, sweetie. Where's your daughter's room? This will all go a lot quicker if you cooperate. You're the detective. Find it yourself. Here. Mm-hmm. And then? Okay, what did you find? Thanks. Yeah. Good. Mom, what are they looking for? I don't know, honey. Yeah. Yeah. And that's everything? Good work. Thank you. I'm going to need your cellphones and your computers, too. Why do you need my stuff? Part of the warrant. I need that. I'm closing multiple properties right now. Sorry. This is the way it works. This is ridiculous. I'll get them back to you as soon as I can. Fine. My computer... In your office. I know. We already have it. I'll need your phones. Are these passcode protected? Yes. I'll need those passcodes. As well as any password for your computers if there is one. Why do you need all this stuff? Alex's cellphone was recovered in the area near where he fell. We just had it analyzed. There were text messages leading up to the incident. So what? Do you want to tell your mother, or should I? It seems your daughter was not at home at the time. Isn't that right, Amber? Look. I just wanted to know why he dumped me. But when I got there I couldn't find him, so I came home. That's it. What are you talking about? You were home with me all night. I snuck out because I knew you'd try and stop me. And I snuck back in because I knew you'd be mad. Honey, why didn't you tell me? Because I didn't do anything. Amber, don't say another word. I'm afraid she's going to have to come down to the station with us. What? Please come with me. Why? This way, please. But I didn't even see him. I swear. Amber Mitchell, you are under arrest for obstruction, and making false statements in the murder of Alexander Cosgrove. Mom, what's happening? I just... You have the right to remain silent. I didn't... Anything you say or do can and will be used against you in a court of law. Detective, this is ridiculous. She didn't do anything. If you can't afford a lawyer, one will be appointed for you by the courts. This is crazy. Wait. I didn't do anything, Mom. Honey, it's going to be okay. We're going to figure this out. I promise you. Ben, they're taking her. They think she did this. This is crazy. Amber? Mom. What am I supposed to do? Right now? Nothing. You get in the way of this, you'll be arrested, too. I'm going to go down to the police station. Stay by the phone. I can't. They took my phone. Then I'll be back as soon as I can. It's okay, baby. I'm going to come get you, okay? I made a few calls and I was able to get some information. It seems that the judge issued the warrant based on some text messages they pulled from Alex's phone. Looks like he agreed to meet Amber at the reservoir. That doesn't prove anything. I know. But those meet-up texts, along with the fact that Amber lied about being at the scene of the crime, the fact that she sent him a threatening text, and their bad breakup, well, that gives him both motive and probable cause. This can't be happening. Look. I know my daughter. She's not capable of hurting anyone. I'm just giving you the facts the way the police are going to present them. When can she come home? Well, I've been trying to get them to expedite her bail hearing, but there's a very long backlog. I'm afraid it might take some time. How long? I don't know. Maybe a week. Oh, my God. Well, can I see her? The police still have to finish processing her. But look. I'm going to go to the courthouse and see what I can do to get them to move up her bail hearing. What can I do? There's nothing you can do at the moment. I can't just sit at home and do nothing while my daughter's in jail. Lisa, I will come get you as soon as you can see her, okay? Hi, sweetie. Are you okay? This is Ben. He's a lawyer. He's going to be helping us. Hi, Amber. You know I love you, no matter what. Nothing's ever going to change that. So, if there's anything you want to tell me and it doesn't matter what it is, you can do that. I didn't do it, Mom. I know. I know. But if Ben's going to be able to help us, then you should tell us everything you can remember about that night. Okay? Okay. I texted Alex and asked if we could meet up. Just because I needed to know how he could do that to me, and I wanted to understand. He was at work, but said he was going to the reservoir after and that I could meet him there. And we agreed to meet at midnight. And what happened then? When I got there it was around midnight, and, you know, I couldn't really see. Alex? Alex? Alex? Alex, this isn't funny. You're a jerk. I thought he was screwing with me, so I left. Well, I can see why they would have a problem with that text. It's just a couple of angry words. After that, did you hear or see anything out of the ordinary? Yeah. I thought I heard someone, but I just figured it was Alex messing with me. I mean, how would the police even know when Alex was pushed? I mean, it could have happened after Amber had already left. Yeah. Alex was wearing a wrist watch, a nice one. And it broke when he hit the ground. But that doesn't prove anything. Only that Amber was at the crime scene, at the time, very mad at the victim, and there's no one to back up her story. However, the evidence is still all very circumstantial. So, they're going to have to come up with something much more concrete if they expect to win this. Okay. Time's up. Come on, Amber. But I'm not going home? I'm afraid not. We still have to have a bail hearing first. Okay. We're doing everything we can to get you out, honey. Okay. I love you. Be strong, okay? You can stay in here. How bad is this? Straight up? Either Amber is the one who pushed Alex down the stairs, or there was someone else there that night. The person she heard? And the reason why Amber didn't see Alex was because he had already been pushed by the time she arrived. I know you wanted these back, so I got them to pull what we need. Thanks. Hey, Heather. It's Lisa. Give me a call when you get this. Honey, you look so stressed. What can I do? I don't know. I just keep going over everything in my head. Maybe if I'd done something differently she wouldn't be in this mess. This is not your fault. Whatever you need, I'm there for you. I just don't understand how they could think Amber would have anything to do with this. She went to see Alex that night. She what? Snuck out of the house the night he was pushed. Why would she do that? Well, she wanted to talk to him. Needed some closure. Well, what happened? Well, she got there and couldn't find him, so she came back home. But she said she heard Alex walking around the reservoir and thought that he was messing with her, you know? But if the person she heard wasn't Alex... What do you mean? I mean, obviously someone else was there that night. Well, and? Well, if the person she heard wasn't Alex, then it was probably the one that pushed him. Well, did she see them? No. It was too dark. But she heard them. You know, Amber only dated Alex for a few weeks. Maybe Kelly would know something that was useful. I don't know. I mean, I think she told the police everything she knows. I know, but... I don't know. Maybe she could tell me something about Alex. Well, let's find out. Kelly, can you come down, please? What, Mom? Lisa needs your help. Okay. What's up? Amber was arrested. They think she has something to do with Alex's accident. Wait. That's crazy. I know. That's why I need your help. What can you tell me about Alex? About his work, his friends, family, anything. He worked at a bar. I never met anyone, but he said something about a roommate. Do you know where he lives? I never went there. What about the bar? At the corner of 6th and Redding. He stopped by there once. I stayed in the car, okay? You better have. Thank you. What are you going to do? I'm going to go get my daughter out of jail. Hi. I'd like to speak with a manager. That's me. What can I help you with? I'd like to ask you some questions about Alex Cosgrove. Are you a detective or something? Because I already spoke to the police. No. I'm Amber Mitchell's mother. Sorry. So, can you help me? I don't know. Please. I need to help my daughter. Give me a minute and I'll meet you over there. Thanks. So, how long did you know Alex? He worked here about a year. So, what can you tell me about him? Not much, really. He kept to himself mostly. When he wasn't chatting up the chicks. Really? Alex was a real charmer. He had a way with women. He'd make them feel like they were the only ones. Well, eventually, they found out they weren't. What do you mean? Alex got bored easy. Did you know any of them? Yeah. Me. Oh. I'm... It was done a long time ago. I'm over it. Do you know anybody who maybe wasn't over it? There was this chick a few weeks ago. They got into it out back by the dumpster. Could have been the same girl that called the night he was killed, too. Wait a minute. She called the same night Alex was killed? Yeah. Some girl called, flipping her lid. Couldn't find him. She was hoping he was here. Did you get a name? No. I'm guessing you knew where Alex lived. He shared an apartment with some guy named Matt downtown. He came in once or twice. Seemed like a real skeeze bag. Do you have an address? Yeah, but Matt's not the kind of guy you want to meet. I don't really have a choice. Your funeral, sister. I'll get you the address. Hey. Hey. So, I just stopped by the bar where Alex worked, and the manager there said that he got a phone call the night he was killed and she sounded really upset. Well, who was it? Was it Amber? She didn't know. But this Alex guy, he sounds like such a player. I wouldn't doubt he was seeing someone else. Did you call the police? No. I want to wait until I talk to the roommate. You know what? Pick me up. I'll go with you. I'm on my way. That's bold. What is he doing? You've never seen a drug deal go down before? No. Have you? I may have smoked a little pot back in the day. Oh, I don't think this is a good idea. Let's go check it out. See what he's got to say. It'll be fine. Argh. I don't know you. We're looking for some pot. I don't know what you're talking about. Alex? Yeah. He's our regular guy. And he said that if he wasn't available we should call you when we can't get a hold of him. So... All right. Come on. You can sit here while I get the stuff. How much do you usually get? Uh, you know, what's normal? Like, half a pound. You cops? You have to tell me if you are. No. We're not cops, but clearly we're not here for $4,000 worth of weed, either. Get out of my house. Look. I'm Lisa Mitchell. That means nothing to me. Alex was dating Amber Mitchell. I'm her mother. Did Alex knock her up or something? She's a suspect in his murder. Hmm. What a waste, if she looks anything like you. Did he have any enemies or anything? Enemies? You know, anybody who would want him dead. Not that I know of. His manager at work said that he'd had an argument with someone. Do you know anybody that he might have been fighting with? Could've been anyone. He was seeing tons of girls. Tons? Well, that's not a crime, is it? Well, did any of them stand out? There was this one chick a couple months back that he was seeing. Real clingy. Wouldn't stop calling him. He gave her the old pump-and-dump. She didn't take it well. Well, do you remember her name? All the girls he's dated? I lost track. Can we take a look at his room? Get out of here. Go on. You know what? We've been sitting outside all day long watching people come and go from this house, and they didn't really look like Jehovah's Witnesses to me. Did they look like Jehovah's Witnesses to you? No. No. So, unless you want the actual heat coming through these doors, you might want to let us take a look. Up the stairs, first door on the left. Go look, and then get the hell out of here. Hey. If I see either of you again, you're going to know what real trouble looks like, okay? Go. Go ahead. Want to check out the closet? More than anything. What are we looking for? Just something that connects him to someone. What about these? Hey, you all done in here? I got to get back to work. Look. Here's my card. If you can remember any names, if you could just call me... Got it. Will do. Bye. Have a good day. Maybe we should call Grayson. With what? Well, He's a drug dealer. Maybe they can shake him down. Well, they're looking for a murderer, not a pot dealer. Maybe he's both. I know you're in here. I just called 911. I need the police. Someone's in my house. I'm locked in the bathroom. Yeah. They're still here. Wait. They're gone. I see him. He went south on Cedar Drive. I told you. I was asleep. I was woken up by a crash. I went into the bathroom and I called 911. I know what you told me. Then do something about it. We're working on it. I can see you're really invested in this case. Well, if it was your daughter, wouldn't you be? Just so you know, we've already cleared this guy. So, you can take him off the wall. Well, it's funny you should say that, since I'm pretty damn sure he's the one who broke in here tonight. Why would he do that? To scare me off. How does he even know you? Heather and I went to see him. You did what? Did you know he's a drug dealer? His roommate was sleeping with both of our daughters. We wanted to see if he knew anything. I'm only going to tell you this once. Leave the police work to us. Otherwise, I'm going to have to charge you with obstruction of justice. Well, maybe if you had done your job, I wouldn't have had to go there. Lisa. I got your call. Came as soon as I could. Who did this? Was it Matt? Yeah. I'm sure of it. He left me a message. What a scumbag. Are you going to arrest him? We don't have enough evidence for that, but we'll certainly go see him. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just a little rattled. Keep your phone on, just in case we have to follow up on any details. Officer. What can I do for you? Matt Wilson, where were you last night? Hey, hey! Stay out of my business! Stay back! Stay back. Settle down. Settle down. I'm just here to talk. Okay? You broke into my house. No, I didn't. I wasn't even in town. Prove it. I don't need to. The cops already cleared me. Then what do you want? Your investigation is costing me money. I figured if I gave you some information, you'd leave me alone. Deal? Yeah, of course. I remember Alex was bragging about these two chicks he was seeing at the same time. The night he died, he was going to see one of them. I already know that. Amber went to meet Alex at the reservoir. No. He was going to see Kelly that night. I thought she was at her house. Look. I'm just telling you what I know. Did you tell the police? No. I just kept my mouth shut. I don't need them digging around my house. Which worked until you came around. I'm protecting my daughter. Okay. Well, now you know. Okay? Leave me out of this. Lisa, is everything okay? Matt was following me. Call the police. No. I mean he wanted to talk to me. He followed me to my car. Well, what did he say? He wasn't even in town when my house was trashed. The cops already cleared him. Look. You need to be careful. You're treading water here between dangerous people and the law. I don't care about that. I only care about my daughter. What else did he say? Well, I don't know if it's relevant, because the cops already know that Alex and Kelly had a relationship. But Matt said that Alex was on his way to meet Kelly the night he died. He didn't tell the police, because he wanted to get out of being questioned without them poking around his house anymore, so he told them he didn't know anything. Well, it's really just hearsay from an admitted criminal. That's what I thought. But I think we should tell Grayson. You know, maybe they'll take another look at Matt or even Kelly. It's not Kelly. Look. It's my job to share any information that might help show the police that it wasn't Amber. You're my client. I should call Heather. I don't think that's a good idea. At this point, let me handle it. She's my friend. Hey, Lisa. Now's not really a good time. I just wanted to talk to you for a second. Yeah? Well, so does that goddamn detective. What about? I have no idea. We're heading down to the station right now. He wants to talk to Kelly. How's she doing? We're going to make it through this. I'll call you when we're done. Bye. What is this about? Kelly, can you could remind me where you were the night Alex fell down the stairs? I've already told you. Do we need a lawyer? There are several discrepancies in what you said, and I want to give you the opportunity to clarify your statement for the record. I've told you everything I know. She was at home with me. You might want to call that lawyer. Why? Because I don't think I'm looking for one killer. I'm looking for two. Hey. Hi. I just left the station. I need to talk to you. Come on in. So, what did Grayson say? Well, we had to get a lawyer. They're holding Kelly overnight. Did you call Ben? I did. But of course now he says it's some kind of conflict of interest, because both of the girls are suspects. It's ridiculous. You know, he just... he kept asking about that night over and over and over again. I think he's trying to frame our girls. What did your lawyer say? He said he has to read the files and cross-reference the cell tower reports. Our girls are suspects in a murder, Lisa. Suspects. We need a drink. All this work for nothing. We'll figure it out. What kind of evidence do they have to hold her, anyway? Well, apparently her cell pinged off a tower near the stairs the night that it happened. How's that even possible? You guys were both at home that night. Didn't you confiscate her cellphone? Well, I did. I mean, I gave it back later. She didn't leave the house, though. That doesn't make any sense. I don't know. Maybe they're wrong. Maybe that's why the lawyer wants to see the cell tower reports. It's like Grayson's not even considering any other suspects. Right? I mean, this scumbag, how is he still out walking the streets free while our daughters are sitting in a jail cell? I don't know. How is he still out walking the streets free while our daughters are sitting in a jail cell? There must be something missing. Our girls couldn't have done this. How could you? How could I what? How could you frame my daughter for this? I don't know what you mean. You were the girl who was fighting with Alex at the bar that night. You're the one who was trying to track him down the night he was killed. You're the other girl we were looking for. I mean, that's insane. I don't even know what you're... I can explain that. No need. I get it. He gave it to you, like he gave one to all of his girls. What I don't get is how you can sleep with your daughter's boyfriend. That's not what happened. Don't lie to me. We are so far past that now. It's me you're talking to. Just tell me the damn truth. I met him first. At that bar. He hit on me. And it felt good. And we got close. And I fell in love with him. I mean, he came to my home. And he must've seen pictures of Kelly there, and searched for her online. I can't believe you brought that monster into our lives. How dare you? You have no idea how charming he was. He made me feel sexy for the first time in years. I thought he loved me. And then, I found out he was sleeping with my child. And I had to stop him. So, you decided to kill him? No! That was an accident. I went there to talk to him, to keep him away from my daughter. Amber? Hey. What, not who you were hoping to see? Come on. What are you doing here? Are you still stalking me, really? Stalking you? No, no. We had something. You let me fall for you and then you made a fool out of me. You fell for me? Okay. Look. It was fun. Right? We had some fun. You couldn't possibly think it was going to be something serious. Of course I did. I was in love with you. It happens to the best of them. I don't know what you want me to say. Why? Why my daughter, of all of the women out there? All the girls. Why my daughter? Because she's the younger version of you. It's that simple. You are never coming near her again. You don't ever come near my daughter ever again. Do you hear me? Okay, look. After having both of you, I'm going to stick with her. Besides, I have a bunch of photos of the both of you. I can't wait to put them online. No, no, no. Maybe I'll just have to... Alex! You okay? Alex? You have to go to the police. If it was an accident, they're not going to charge you with murder. You can't let my daughter pay the price for what you've done. No. I can't risk that. She's in jail because of you. You think I wanted it to end up like this? You killed him. So what? He was ruining our lives. You have to go to the police. No. I can't. I'm not asking. You give me that. There's still time to make this right, Heather. No, there isn't. Are you insane? Why couldn't you just mind your own business? I had to protect my family. You couldn't just stop and leave things alone? Heather, I'm begging you. Please don't do this. I won't let you destroy my family. Lisa. Lisa. You need to send an ambulance. One's on its way. We saw everything, Lisa. It's over. Mom. Mom! Amber. Baby. Oh, I missed you. I missed you. Your mother's a very special woman. And you're a very lucky girl. Thank you. Mom, what's going to happen to Kelly? I don't know. I guess she'll stay with her father. Let's go inside.
