I already told you that you're the only one who wants to have fun. Scumbag! Ow! It hurts! What's wrong Tecchan? Apologize to Chokko! Say "I'm sorry" I'm sorry... What's going on? "We are all pieces of shit. We won't get close to Ando ever again." "We will return all of his money." Say it! We are all pieces of shit... Hey..what are you saying? We won't get close to Ando-kun ever again. We will return all of his money... Then give it back right now. Hiro... I don't have it....right now... Give it back! I don't have it. Hiro! That's enough. Chokko. Why are you protecting a guy like him? Hey Tecchan! Are you okay? Excuse me! Shishigami-kun! Who were you again? I'm Watanabe Shion. Oh, that's right. You're in the same class as me right?

(No bullets were found at the scene) According to the police, the victims were shot by a gun but no traces of bullets have been found. Here. You can use this as pocket money. I can't take that! It's fine! Think of it as an act of kindness from a friend. Hey... Were you the one who murdered those people in Chofu city? Huh? You know what? You wouldn't kill me right? What the hell? That's horrible! No! Sorry... That really hurt me man. Well... But... God needs to have ambition. God? I became a God. I've made a lot of miracles happen. Chokko. I'm going to continue to protect you. I'm stronger than the police or the military after all. Can you please stop this? Do you hate me now? This isn't about hate! It's impossible. I can't believe you can kill people so easily. But you know what? Do the murdered victims have anything to do with you? For example all over the world millions of people you have never even heard of die or get killed. Are you going to feel sad about their deaths? Besides, to not murder is a rule for humans. I'm not a human. It's impossible. To continue being your friend. It's impossible man! Don't come to my house anymore! I understand. Make sure you go to school. Farewell. You came home early today. Yeah. Some stuff happened. Oh yeah, how was your visit at your Dad's house? There was Sukiyaki. It was incredible meat. Mom let me eat a lot. Hiro You seem like you're becoming family with them. Starting next month Please live with them. What are you saying Mom? Your Dad will let you go to university too. What's wrong? I'm here with you Mom. Hiro. Your mother... has pancreatic cancer. It has spread to my lungs too. The doctor told me there is nothing he can do for me. Sorry! For not telling you. I don't want that! Why do you have to go through this? You haven't done anything wrong! Hiro.... I don't want to die! I won't let you die... I definitely won't let you die! I won't let you die! Don't just stay quiet, say something! Take a look at this dear! Takeshi stole this money from my purse! Be quiet! What's going on? Mari! You skipped school again didn't you? This year your grades are on the borderline of failing, you won't pass like this! It's fine if I fail. I mean...if you don't graduate, what about university? I have something I want to do more than university. Don't tell me... Are you still writing manga? You are her father! Say something to her! Isn't having a dream a good thing? What's up with that? You need to properly discipline her! That's why all of this stuff is happening! Dad hasn't been going to his company recently. Do you want to call his coworkers? Well.. My health has been pretty bad recently. You need to get it together! If you get fired, how are we going to pay our mortgage!? It's okay! I'll protect this household! Takeshi. Don't do immoral things because your father doesn't have money. You too Mari. I want you to live a life without regrets. You're grossing me out. Are you trying to be cool? How can you protect this household? You don't know anything! Your son has always been bullied and threatened by his classmates. Takeshi... Is that why you stole the money? You're infatuated with younger men too Mom! What are you saying M-Mari!? Weren't you crying and talking to someone on the phone the other day? That's because... That's because.. your father doesn't make enough money! I'm worried about our pension and mortgage after all! Can you protect... This household Dad? You can't....protect anything! Buying a house.. Giving your children an allowance... You can't do any of that! I.. don't want to become someone like you! Hey... You need to say something! I can't save them huh? If I can't protect my family... Then I'm just scrap metal! Shit! The only one on my side is Hanako! Only her! God. Please save me! Save me! At this rate... My friend is going to kill people again. God...please do something about this! Please stop Hiro! I can do it! He uses his power to kill people. And I use it to save people. I can do it! Hanako... Please watch me! Lightning? It's a shooting star! Hanako! This is amazing! What should I do? Please save me! That night he was also sitting on this bench. We both saw the same light Then we were engulfed in that light. I think you and Hiro were struck by some kind of shock here. And then someone turned you guys into robots. Someone? Some kind of higher life form. In other words.... I....umm... died or something like that? Well... Umm... I don't think you... It's fine! It's fine! I've lived a long life anyways. But right now I'm... saving people and I finally have felt that my life is substantial. Hiro is also a really nice guy. When we were little he always protected me. When his dog was being put down he cried and told them "Don't kill him!" He also had a dog? Please stop Hiro! You have the same body. You should know his weakness right? You say weakness.... but the only thing I can recall is Miso soup. Miso soup? When I drank the miso soup I spit it back out! Anyways... Your body looks the same as Hiro's body. It must function the same too. I'll tell you all about the things I've seen. Bang! Say it with more energy please. Bang! More! Bang! More! More! Bang! Bang! Bang! More! More! Say it like you mean it! Bang!!! I hit it! I hit it! I can do it too! There's still a lot more to do. How should I say this? I don't have much time left do I? No. I could not find any cancer cells. Everything...disappeared. These were the pictures that were taken last time but.. There's no shadowing of the pancreas at all. For my cancer to just disappear.... It's a really surreal feeling... From now on you're going to have a happy future alright? You can wear some nice clothes and eat delicious food. Where do we have that kind of money? Oh, that's right! We don't we try living overseas? I mean, didn't you say you wanted to go to France? You're so sweet Hiro! It's the thought that counts. I'm being serious here! I will definitely make you happy! Thanks!

He has murdered 3 policemen And has escaped from the police. I can't believe it! How could this be possible? And has escaped from the police. I can't believe it! How could this be possible?

This is a photo of Shishigami Hiro. Shishigami has not gone to school since the incident. According to the school authorities he has a very calm disposition. He doesn't seem like the type of person who would murder someone. This boy For his elementary graduation essay he wrote that he wanted to be a normal salary man in the future. He looks like a normal teenager but...it seems like he grew up in an environment where his parents were divorced. (I found his apartment!) This might have caused a lot of damage to his psychology. Shishigami-kun? I never thought I'd meet you in a place like this! Eat as much as you want! I'm fine. But...you didn't eat lunch... You don't have an appetite huh? Alright, then I'll give you a cup of tea later. I'm sorry. The TV is broken. It's just me and my grandma so... You can stay as long as you want. And your parents? I don't have any. They died from an illness after all. That's why I won't live long either. Bang! I can't do anymore... When I use my power I get so thirsty! Water must be the source of your power huh? I'm not cut out for this after all! Your next power will be the ability to move cars! Shishigami-kun can do something like that? You can't do anything can you Inuyashiki-san? What's wrong? I'm sorry! It got all over your clothes! It's okay! It's okay! This is the same thing that happened when I drank Miso soup. Perhaps... You're not able to ingest salt? Salt? Miso soup has salt in it! And look! Sports drinks have sodium in them too! Shishigami's eyes would be scary sometimes. But I can't believe it. How scary! What's wrong? Mari? Ah, it's nothing. I just remembered something I have to do. Sorry! See ya later! Hey Ando-kun. Why were you with my Dad? Hold on! Umm..well... I met him in an online game. See ya later! Hold on! In this interview I want to express my sincere apologies to the victims. What are your thoughts on this case? My son has done something unforgivable as a human being. Your son is a suspect! As his mother how do you take responsibility for the atrocities he has committed against the victim's families? How should I take responsibility? Why did things turn out this way? Even if you cry the murdered victims won't come back to life!! Don't you have any sincere apologies? Mom... I'm really...really sorry! Shishigami-san! I'm really...really sorry! Shishigami-san! Is that all you have to say!? Is that all!? Mom... I'm sorry... Shishigami-san! Demon murderer, demon murderer, demon murder, demon murderer. (Come out Shishigami!) (Did he hear what his Mom said?)

One week after the incident he has been confirmed dead at 6 o clock. He is dead and the case is now closed. We didn't find the corpse! The police are just trying to maintain law and order. Then do our reports have any meaning at all? We haven't found Shishigami's corpse And broken parts of him are scattered around. How do we explain that to people? People will ridicule us. Today the police held a press conference. Shishigami Hiro known as the worst killing machine of the century has been confirmed as dead. Shishigami is dead? I wonder who killed such a scary murderer like that? The police chief said that the police will take measures to insure that something like this never happens again. He will make sure to improve our law and order. He will not fail to live up to everyone's expectations and maintain everyone's trust. Hurry up and eat everyone! I'm going to be working morning shifts now. Otherwise we won't be able to pay our mortgage. Takeshi! I get it! (The Shishigami case was full of mysteries.) Oh that's right!
