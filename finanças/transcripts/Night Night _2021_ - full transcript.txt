You have to be somebody... - And bring something with you. - Yeah. Cheers. - To good old alcohol. - To consideration. - Okay, that, too. - Alcohol you later. Hm. I can't go down faster. Oh, yeah. Let's get two more over here, please? I... no round two. I have to drive home, still. Fine. Then I'm takin' yours. Okay, hot shot. I had to say, it's a pretty decent way to spend an afternoon. - Decent? - Yo, yeah. I would say it's pretty great, because technically, we're getting paid for this, so... In that case, we should probably keep this between us. - Who am I gonna tell? - Duh... I don't have any time to make friends, because I'm constantly having to pick up slack for my... inferior co-workers. Yes, you. - Ouch. - Uh-huh. - Oh, shit. - What? Sorry. My brother. I forgot we have a meeting with our lawyer today. So, I take it, it's a no. Let's make that a rain check. - Okay. - Okay. - Wait. - I'll see you Monday. - Uh-huh. - Try to keep up. Let's go. Jax, why you always so late? Jax, you're such a fuck-up. Nobody's ever gonna respect you... - I got tied up working. - If you can't even get up... Jax, when I call, you need to pick up. Really? - You smell like weed, Jax. - So? You just got out of rehab. Yeah, but weed doesn't count. It's medicinal. God, yeah, Mom and Dad would have been real proud. Yo, you're the one that was late, not me, all right? Let's just get this over with. All righty. Well, Mr. Davis. Congratulations. For what? April tells me that you're going to be traveling to the U.K. - next week. - Uh-huh. Four years studying abroad. Yo, I hate to... sound rude, man, but I gotta go meet some friends. Yeah. Well, you gotta appreciate it when you can. Anyway. All right. So, as you know, April's been named the executive of your parents' estate. And it looks like all the documents have been released, and the assets have been settled. So, April. Are you going to obtain ownership of the family home in Corsicana? - Uh-huh. - I know that's a pretty big place to be staying alone. Do you have any intentions on selling? Uh, no. I've actually been staying there, for a while now, so, no. Well, in addition to the family home, you're gonna receive 53 percent of all the insurance policies, investments, and cash accounts. Wait. Uh, 53, I think... I think you're mistaken, I think it's actually supposed to be an even fifty-fifty split. No. Well, see, according to the terms of the will, the executor receives an additional three percent for managing the probate. Pretty much standard practice in these cases. And, uh, according to the terms of the will, April's gonna manage all assets until you graduate. Wait, so... So you're trying to tell me that I have to fly all the way back from London, for a five-minute meeting, to get what's already mine? Mr. Davis, a five-minute meeting is the only thing standing between you and almost three million dollars of real estate and liquid assets. Cool. Cool. You know, whatever. Uh, A, you got it from here? Peace out, guys. Peace out. Wow. You know, I don't think there's a judge in the world that would be as tolerant of your brother as I am. No. I know, and I'm... Thank you for putting up with him. I'm so sorry. I'm just glad that somebody in the family turned out responsible. - Thank you. - I thank you. Now, look... - Uh... - Uh, sorry. Not important. What's next? - Mine! - No! Mommy! Stop being mean to your sister! You guys need to calm down! Mom! This dumb won't get me it! Come on, pick up. Are you... Where are you? Answer the fucking phone! You know it's Valentine's Day. And I get it you're not here. 'Cause you're never fucking here, are you? Where are you? Come on, come on. Hi! I need some help! Nurse! Nurse! Hi! Hi, I'm looking for my sister, her name's... - Okay, one moment. - April Davis. It's April Davis, the cops just called me, said she was in an accident. It says here she's still in surgery. What? Surgery? Surgery? What does that mean? Surgery? Her status is listed as critical at this time. Okay, just give me your name, I'll leave a call note for the surgeon, - he'll call you just as soon... - It's Jax, it's Jax. J-A-X, J-A-X, uh, Davis. Whe... critical? Wha...? Critical, does that mean she... she can die, right? This is all the information that's available to you right now. Why don't you, take a seat, get some rest, - this could take a while, okay? - Okay, I... I... do you know where the nearest restroom is? - It's down the hall to the left. - Thank you. Hold on. Fucking... Jax. Come on. Excuse me, are you Jax Davis? Yeah. Yeah, I am. Yes. Good evening. I'm Doctor Vasquez. I'm the neurosurgeon assigned to your sister's case. Is she gonna be okay? I'm sorry, should we be expecting anyone else? No. It's just me and her. Our parents died in an accident, few months ago. Ah. Oh, I am sorry to hear that. Is April okay? To be honest, Jax, the fact that she's even alive at this point, is nothing short of a miracle. She lost a lot of blood. Every organ in her body is fighting for resources right now. She's... think she's gonna live? The next 72 hours are crucial. All we can do now is wait and see how her body responds to the surgeries. I'm sorry, Jax. Do you think maybe I could see her? Of course. But you have to be prepared that we have her intubated, and, uh, on life support. How long is she gonna be on that? I... I really don't know. If her body responds positively, um... it could still be months before we know if there's any lasting brain damage. Right. If she... like, makes it, do you think she's gonna still be kinda normal? Well, um, she may have some short-term issues with hallucinations, um, anxiety, vertigo, and most likely retrograde amnesia. Jax, like I said, all we can do now at this point is wait. You must be Jax. Yeah? Who are you? I'm Robert. April's boyfriend. Boyfriend. She's... told me a lot about you. Yeah, well, wish I could say the same about you. How's she doin'? I don't know. I spoke to the doctor about her status. He said, she won't be lucid for at least another few months. That's the word on the street, isn't it? April told me all about your adventures abroad, - that you have coming up. - Had. Oh. She wouldn't want you cooped up in a hospital like this, wasting an opportunity like that. Yeah, well. I'm all she has. She has me, too. I'll take care of her, Jax, I... I promise you that. I know, about your parents. I wouldn't want you to have to go through something like that again. Go. April would want you to. When you get back, we'll both still be here. Nurse! She... she's moving! Nurse! What... what... what do we do? - April, April! - April. - April? - Can I touch her? - Calm down. - Where's the doctor? - Just calm down. - Where's the doctor? - Hold on. April? - Here's Doctor Nelson. Blink once if you can hear me. - April. We're right here. - Can you squeeze my finger? - There you go. - You're gonna be okay. - I need you to stay calm, okay? - I got... I'm calm. April, you are one lucky young lady. The CT came back negative. And I believe we are out of the danger zone. Our biggest worry now is your minor brain swelling caused by the, head trauma. So no long-term effects? Well, she's only been awake for 24 hours, but what I've seen so far she's looking really good. She may have a little trouble with short-term memory issues, but the medication should help with any sensory disconnect. So, that being said. Do you remember anything prior to the accident? Maybe even the accident? I... Did they make it? It's very unfortunate, but... Accidents happen. It's gonna be okay. Stop! I'm gonna bust a stitch! I can't help it. This hospital gown - is really doing it for me. - Hm. April Davis? I'm Detective Dan Putman, and this is Detective Grant Sheppard, we're with the CPD. Like to ask you a few questions about your accident. Hey, excuse me. I don't think now is a really great time... No, no. No, it's okay. Yeah, that's fine. Please come in. Thank you. We'll try to be brief. Ms Davis, we're with the Crimes Against Persons division. I'd like to ask you a few questions so we can close our investigation. Crime against persons? I... I was in a car accident. Standard operating procedure. We just wanna ask you a few questions. She almost died in that accident. I don't see why you have to ask her questions at all. I'm sorry, who are you, exactly? Robert, it's okay. That's fine. What do you need to know? Oh, we got your lab results back from your blood drawing. Wait a minute. You went into her private medical records? Sir, it's important that we're able to gather as much information on that day as possible. She has been in a coma for five months! Okay. Easy. Easy. It's okay. As I was saying, we got a copy of your lab results back from your blood drawing. In the state of Texas, you are considered to be legally intoxicated at point zero eight. Your blood alcohol content, or BAC, registered at point zero seven. Okay. So that means I wasn't legally intoxicated. No, but there's enough probable cause to think that alcohol had something to do with the accident. Wait a minute, that's bullshit, 'cause you just said she was below the legal limit. Let me explain something to you. First, we had a court order for the blood draw. Second, if you interfere with my interview one more time, I'm gonna throw your ass in jail. Officers recovered your cellphone from the accident. It was pinned between your chest and the steering wheel when you were recovered from the vehicle. So what are you trying to imply? Well, we obtained a warrant for your cellphone. Your message history clearly indicates that, at the time of the accident, you were involved in a conversation. I was at a stop-light five minutes prior. I'd... I just replied to some text, that's it. Your cellphone pinged at the closest tower to the accident. We were able to look at the information and see the text messages back and forth between you and your boyfriend. Go ahead. She's telling you the truth. I texted her once, she said she was just leaving, and we didn't text any more after that. Hm. There are numerous conversations... Detectives, I don't feel comfortable, um, answering any more of your questions. I just want my lawyer present. Okay. That's fine. Hope you feel better soon. Have a nice evening. Both of you. It feels so weird to be outside again. It's been five months. Five months of my life gone. Just like that. I still can't believe you stayed with me that whole time. Hey. Of course I did. Before the accident, you know, I didn't know if we were serious, or 'cause we were only dating for, like a month or so, prior. I think my head was just in a place of... Yeah, I think, what I'm trying to say is thank you. And that it means a lot to me. Oh, be careful, my hand's still so sore from those IVs. Sorry. Accidents happen. This pain is making me so irritable, and I shouldn't be taking it out on you, I'm sorry. It's okay. Oh, shit. Shit. I forgot to call the Home Care Aid and see if they... please remind me to do that, okay? No need. What do you mean? Well, I was gonna keep it a surprise, but I spoke to the Home Office, about working out of DFW for the next month. - Are you serious? - Absolutely. I'll have to go back to Houston for a business trip for a day or two, but other than that, I should be home by... should be at your house, by six every night. Thank you, so much. You deserve it. Oh, and before I forget, I got you this as well. - What is it? - Something practical. You... You got me a phone, Robert? Well, with the police holding yours hostage, I thought you'd need a way to stay connected to me. I don't even know what to say. I can't believe this. You don't have to say anything. Thank you. You deserve it. Oh, hold on. I think you just passed my exit. Oh, I found a shortcut the other day. Now you can avoid the school zones. It's easy, you just, uh, take a right at the creepy pink warehouse. - Welcome home. - Hm, thank you. Let me get the stuff. Are you okay? Yeah. Everything just, like, turned upside down for a second. It's probably nothing to worry about. Doctor Nelson said you might experience a little vertigo. - I know. - Let's get you inside. Okay. - Thank you. - Of course. Come on. I may get an urn here somewhere. I got it. I made a spare. With everything that was happening, I just wanted to make sure everything was taken care of. Okay. And I picked up some groceries. And I made sure to stock you up on all your favorite wine. You're comfortable, and I will be right back. - Hey, Robert? - Yeah, babe? Did you get me a new computer monitor? Yeah, a vendor gave me a new one. I thought I'd just install it for you. Wow. Really thought of everything. Well, this should take care of that headache. And I... believe that's your favorite wine. You know, I probably shouldn't be mixing these. Hey. With everything you've been through, one glass of wine won't kill you. You're right. I'm gonna start a fire, and then I will make my world-famous chicken Alfredo. By which I mean that I will order Napoli's. Yes. Okay. Sounds perfect. Spam, spam, spam, spam. Odd. Three hearts for each. So cute. Okay. No hallucinating tonight. Hm. Hey, Robert? Yeah? Do you need a towel? Uh, yeah. Thanks. Hey, babe? I'm running late, I'll see you tonight. Okay. Robert? Just know that you don't have to keep coming home every single night for me. I know, taking care of me will take a toll on you, so just let me know. Okay? Nice try. You can't get rid of me that easy. Whoo! Shot! What the fuck, my dude? - Jax, hi! - I thought you were in Madrid. No. Why do you call him Shot? That, you don't wanna know. Trust me. But yo, Madrid was cool, she gets boring on us. Yeah, only you, playboy. But yo, I got this new shit last night. Hm. Bro, fire. - Oh. - Yeah. Can I smell it? Yeah, but you gotta pay, man. This shit, it's expensive. - Is it worth it? - Always. Come on. Except for the time I ended up in a fucking ditch in Madrid! Okay, but you and I both know that that was your fault, not mine. Goddammit. What's up, Mr. Popular? Who's calling? It's my fucking sister, she's been on my ass all night. Just, two seconds. Bro. Come on, I got the fire. Save it for me, or I will tell her why I call you Shots. - Hey! - Oh, thank god! Jax, I know you said you were busy this weekend, but I just wanna talk to you for a second. I'm feeling paranoid. Yo, I... I... I can barely hear you! Please, just go somewhere quieter and talk to me for a second. I... I'm feeling paranoid. You just say you have a hemorrhoid? What? No! Ew! I'm... I'm saying I'm paranoid! Please, just talk to me. - Yo, I... I can't hear you! - Jax. I need you to be my sounding board right now. Just please talk with me. Please! Look, I'm in a club in Paris right now. I... I can't hear what you're saying. It sounds like you said, you had a hemorrhoid, but I... I don't know why you would talk to your fucking brother about that. My god. Jax, I didn't say hemorrhoid. Yo, sorry, I... I can't hear you, all right? Just text me, all right? Bye! You were right. Phone records show numerous text messages back and forth between April and a co-worker. William Swain. She's... she's dead. What? I said she's... she's fucking dead! I guess this is a... uh... moot point, then. What the fuck is wrong with you? What the fuck is wrong with you, April? April, wake up! No, no. I'm okay, I'm okay. I just fell asleep. What are you thinking? You have to be careful, mixing wine and pills like that. I'm not mixing them. I... I haven't slept in two days. Jesus, you scare me. I can't lose you, okay? Hey. Sorry. That I got so carried away in there. I guess I'm... wound up pretty tight. Thought I lost you. It's okay, I was just tired. Hey, look at me. You can talk to me. What's really on your mind, Robert? When the detectives came, you said you were texting your boyfriend, they were about to ask you something, and you cut them off. Yes. Because I'm not gonna let these detectives intimidate me to saying something that they can just take out of context. Okay? Is that what really's been on your mind this whole time? Why didn't you bring it up sooner? Sorry. I shouldn't have brought it up at all. No, I'm glad you did. You get some sleep. Lay down. I got a lot of work orders to finish. Night night, sleep tight. Night night, sleep tight. Night night, sleep tight. Clean Comp. Clean Comp ensures that all home videos, pictures, personal information and browser history are permanently deleted and irrecoverable. No. This is impossible. Jax, please answer the phone. Please. You're the only person I can think of to call, and I don't know if I'm freaking out or I'm fucking hallucinating because of these meds. You're the only person I wanna talk to about this, and I just... I need your advice. Please, call me back. Detective Putman speaking. Hi, this is April Davis. Um, you came to the hospital and interviewed me about my accident? Ms Davis, it's almost two o'clock in the morning. I know. I... I'm so sorry, but I wouldn't be calling if it wasn't important. What is it? Can we meet in person? Um, tell you what. I'll-I'll swing by tomorrow afternoon, and we'll... we'll get it figured out, all right? Thank you. Have a good night, Ms Davis. Thank you, you too. Good night. Come on. Answer the phone, Will. Pick up the phone. April? Will? Will, listen to me. I didn't even know you'd woken up. I, uh, brought you flowers, but there was some creepy dude sitting next to your bed - groping your hands. - Will, listen to me. You have to get out of your house. Something's wrong. I... I can see on my TV right now through your web-cam. April, my web-cam's disabled. - Wh... what's going on? - Oh my god! Oh my god, can you see them? Can I see what? - What are you talking about? - No, there's a family behind you and they're gonna... - Okay, April... - Oh my god. You're not making any sense, all right? You're starting to freak me out. Night night, April. Fucking hell. Good morning. Did you break a glass last night? Yeah. I tried to text you, but you left your phone here, so... That's okay. I cleaned it up. Thank you. Where did you go last night? I went back to the airport, seems like every ride they break something new. You get some rest, I'll be back later. Love ya. For everyone of the CPD, what was ideally a routine traffic accident is now a murder investigation, the victim being one of their own. This case is very fluid at this point. All we know for sure is that Detective Putman finished his shift at eight p.m. We don't know if he was targeted, or if this was a random act of violence, or road rage. We currently have assigned two teams of homicide detectives to this case, one is carefully retracing his last 48 hours. The other's poring over old cases, trying to find somebody who maybe had a... a grudge that would warrant this kind of intense response. Thank you, Chief Harrison. Our condolences for the officer loss, and how much he's done for the community and the CPD. Shit. This is Palladium Airlines, how can I direct your call? I'd like to speak to Robert Mitchell, please. He works in your IT department. Please hold while I connect you to IT. Come on. Come on, come on. IT, how may I help you? Uh, I'd like to speak to Robert Mitchell. Hold, please. I don't see anyone listed by that name. Are you sure? He's temporarily working out of your DFW location. - Temporarily? - Yes, he usually works out of the Houston branch. Uh, I think you may be mistaken. Palladium Airlines hasn't flown out of Houston since 2015. Hello? Close me up, please. Thank you. You're not leaving already. It's not even eight yet. Well, apparently, you've never been in a room for three days, with real-estate tycoon wannabe's who are listening to a speaker who thinks she's God's gift to absolutely everything. So you're a real-estate tycoon wannabe? No. I'm God's gift. Oh. April Davis. Robert Mitchell. Hm. Nice watch. - Submariner? - Master Two. Worked hard for this watch. Got for myself as a present after college. Never take it off. Never? Ever. Well, I like the commitment. So what brings you to Tulsa? I work for Palladium Airlines. Oh, so you're a pilot. Not that glamorous. No, I work in IT. I'm an IT manager. So, you're the one that can hack the system and get me free tickets, right? Exactly. Now aren't you a little young to be speaking in a seminar? Yes. Yeah, I am. Detective Sheppard, hi. Hey, I'm sorry to disturb you, Ma'am. Uh, do you have a few moments to speak with me? - Yeah. Yeah, please come in. - Great. I'm so sorry about Detective Putman. Thank you. I appreciate that. Yeah, it's been, uh... It's been rough. I bet. Do you have any leads yet? Not yet. That's actually why I'm here. I've been assigned to take over all of his recent cases, to see if anyone may have had an axe to grind. We have to follow up with any lead that we have, so... please don't take what I'm about to say the wrong way. Homicide retrieved Detective Putman's cellphone from the crime scene. The last activity was a text message from you requesting a meeting. Do you mind telling me what that was in reference to? Yes. Ever since I got out of the hospital, really weird things have been happening. I don't know if somebody's trying to mess with me. - Hm. - Or hurt me. Um. Or... Or what? Or if it's just all in my head. I see. You said, someone may be looking to hurt you, who do you think is involved with that? Robert. I can tell we touched a nerve with him when we came to visit you at the hospital. I figured part of that was just him going into protective mode. Putman wasn't as sensitive as I am with certain things. What do you mean? Well, when Robert told us that you had texted him only once during the wreck, Putman intervened, and... mentioned that other people were involved. So you know the truth about that. Yes. We know that you were texting with your co-worker William Swain. We've retrieved copies of your text messages and the... the photo that you sent. We figured that was what... Robert wanted to ask us about, but... Did he not? No. The only thing he was concerned about, really, was... was the accident. But why? I'm not sure. You know, basically, he was picking our brains for details about the accident. You know, we thought it was pretty strange, but hey, we're detectives. We're used to strange. Yes, but why would he want to know about that at all? I'm not sure, but he was pretty wound up about it. Let me ask you a question. Has Robert changed much, since the accident? He's been different. He's been angry. And... um, little things seem to set him off. Okay. It's like he's hiding something from me. It's like oh, I'm no... I don't know. Hey, it's okay. Like I said, I'm... I'm sure I heard worse. Way worse. We had what I thought was gonna be a one-night stand in Tulsa. And then I told him that I lived outside of Dallas, and he said... he worked there, you know, two days out of the week. Ah, so, you're saying things pretty much escalated quicker than you anticipated. Yes. Something like that. Have you snooped around on any of his social media accounts or anything? Oh, he doesn't have any. What about friends or family members? Have you met them, or, co-workers that he works with? None. And just before you got here, I was on the phone with the airline. - And I asked to speak to him. - Uh-huh. And they said, nobody goes by that name in the IT department. Have you, confronted him about this? No. Not yet. I mean, all this just happened in the last week or so. And I'm just feeling very vulnerable, and confused right now. Because what if there's a logical explanation for all of this? I mean, he moved into my house to take care of me. You're right. There could be a logical explanation. While you're here, there's something I wanna show you. Okay, look at this. So there's this... What happened? - Hey, you okay? - What? - Are you okay? - Um... Yes. Yeah, I think I... I was mistaken. Um... This recovery has been so tough, and I've been taking so many pain pills, I just don't think I know what's real any more. Okay. Look, I understand. How about this, I'm gonna go back to the office, do a little bit more digging on his background, and, I'll call you if I find anything. - Okay. - Yeah. Look, I'm gonna help you get to the bottom of this. So don't worry. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. Hey, April? Be careful. - Hi. - Jesus! You scared me. Didn't you hear me at the door? You couldn't... walk up, and help me open the damn thing? I got dinner, but I guess you've already eaten? Have you been drinking? Really? You're gonna lecture me about that subject. Look, I had a really bad day. And I'm really sorry. I shouldn't have taken it out on you. It's just... there's still a ton of issues with the training center, and I just... No. No, I know. You're having to go back and forth between me and your work, I get it, it's taking a toll on you. You've got to be kidding me. What the hell are we missing? Corporate's been on my ass since the upgrade. You think? Yeah, I'll meet you there. Call Mike, and get him there, too. Goddammit, the entire system went down ten minutes ago. I'll be up late, don't wait up for me. Hey, what up? I don't know, he got home and he was really upset. It was like he was drunk or something. And what'd he say? Um, you know, I was in my bedroom, and then... All of a sudden, I heard him on the phone. He was talking really really loud. All right, so he wanted you to hear. Definitely seem like it. And then he came in the bedroom and he said, "Don't wait up for me, I have to go to work for the night," and... he wouldn't even look at me. The look in his face tonight... was filled with so much hate. Look, I'll tell you what, I'm getting off early this night, - would you like me to come over? - Yes. I would... I would really like that, actually. Thank you, Detective Sheppard. Uh, it's... It's Grant. Sorry? My name, it's... is Grant. Okay. See you soon, Grant. Thank you for coming, it means a lot. - No problem. - I was getting a little scared. I don't blame you. Want anything to drink? Coffee? Water? I'm off duty. Surely you have something a little bit... stronger? I'm gonna pour myself something a little softer. I think I have to slow down a little bit. No problem. - Thank you so much. - Of course. To new friends. And to old friends. May we never forget them. So you, say he came home very irritable. Has he gotten worse? I mean, no, it was just tonight, when he came home drunk. And he settled down and then he got the fake phone call and then he left. Or I think it was fake, I don't know. This may be a shot in the dark, but can I see your cellphone for a second? Yeah, of course. - What are you looking for? - I'll know it when I see it. Do you always use the Cloud server? Uh, pretty much, yeah. I have to back-up everything up for work. Okay, what about your photos? Do they automatically upload to the Cloud? Yeah, I think so. Why? I think Robert may have created another Cloud account to intercept all of your photos and your incoming information. Go on to your settings, under user text messages, and look for send and receive, do you recognize any of the numbers? - Well, this is mine. - Okay. And that's his. I had a feeling. Oh my god, can he see all of my messages? Yes. He can. You said he came home irritable and then later left. In that time-frame, do you remember when I texted you? Um, right after he came home drunk, and then right before he left. I got a court order for his cellphone. The only person that he texts, or calls on that phone was you. But what does it have to do with the software and the purpose of putting in the family in these photos, and... Never mind. Oh... no, what were you about to say? I'm gonna seem like an idiot, but I know what I saw. And I think he put them there. But... what are you talking about... What did you see? What-put what there? I got an email, from a travel company I've never heard of before. And it was titled, Places to Visit Before You Die. And then I clicked on the link, and it took me to a street-view map, and I was just looking up random locations, and this family, was in every single spot that I searched, and I knew it was the same family, because it was a... it was a husband, a wife, and two kids. And one of the kids was wearing yellow shoes and the other had a stuffed monkey. Yellow shoes. Yeah. I have to ask you an uncomfortable question. Okay? Have you seen or read anything about your... accident? No. It's not something I'd want to re-live. No, I'd... I understand. Something strange caught my eye, so I pulled AI folder. Oh my god. - You don't think... - I don't think anything. This could be all coincidence. Do any of these look familiar? It's identical. I have to show you something. That's them! That's the same family, and that's the yellow shoe and that's the stuffed monkey. Oh my god! Oh my god! I think I'm gonna be... I believe I'm gonna pass out. Hey, it's gonna be okay. Everything's going to be fine. Let me head back to the station so that I can figure it out. In the mean time, you're gonna keep your doors locked and your phone on you, okay? - Uh-huh. - It's gonna be fine. I promise. - Okay? - Okay. - Okay. - Okay. Lucas. - Here. - I need you to help with something, buddy. Yeah, what else is new? Lucas, I'm serious. This is important, okay? Or I'll tell Chief you're playing video games instead of working. Yeah, plug it into the back computer. All right, she's in there. Right. Yeah. Aha. Huh. One of my keys broke. But it's... it's okay. I got it. Hey, uh... What are you doing? Hacking. Goodbye. Shit. Shit. I'm still... I'm still hacking. All righty. You gotta go to the bathroom or something? - You keep moving around. - No, I'm good, I'm good, Lucas. - You're kinda distracting. - You got around anything yet? Uh, I got something. Um... Okay, it looks like a pre-paid phone, and the calls only go to someone named April. What the hell does an IT guy need a burner phone? That's creepy. Here he is. Okay, what do we got? Oh, fudge! - What happened? - He... I... For a split second, I almost had the bastard. What do you mean, for a split second? Did you get a virus or something? I mean, what... what are you doing? Virus... in... that... that hard drive is, like, one big-ass petri dish. I mean, there's like, uh, a key logger, from the Ukraine in here. Weird internet re-routing crap. Clean Comp. Cloud monitor. It's like a shit-show in here. - Okay, okay... - And then... I almost had him, and then... poof. - What do you mean... - It was gone. - It was gone. - What do you mean, did he wipe it? I mean, what do you mean it's just gone? - Whoosh? - Yeah. He must have... wiped it when the scan went through. Damn, this guy is skilled. He knows what he's doing. Right. So the... so that's it? Yeah. All right. - Where you goin'? - Where do you think I'm goin'? To the bathroom? Or, uh... you forgot your keys, or your wallet, or your... your cellphone or something? You have one new message. April, it's Grant. Listen, I was just at the Police Department, looking through Robert's file, and... and, listen, April! You're not safe in that house right now, okay? You need to get out as soon as possible. I'm on my way, call me! All right? Call me! You have been locked out by TechSoft security controls. Damn you, Robert. What the... Looking for these? grunt] April... Why are you doing this? You really don't know by now, April? Is it because I cheated on you? We weren't even in a serious relationship, Robert. I'm sorry! Think, harder. Worked hard for this watch. Never take it off. April Davis. Robert Mitchell. Did they make it? Accidents happen. He acts whether or not the children were alive when the ambulance arrived. Did they suffer? You know, I probably shouldn't be mixing these. One glass of wine will kill you. I went back to the airport, Seems like every ride they break something new. This family was in every single spot that I searched, and I knew it was the same family, because it was a... it was a husband, a wife, and two kids. The look in his face, was filled with so much hate. Night night, sleep tight. Sir, I have Corporate on hold on line two for you. Can you take it, please? Just give your signature before you go in there. It was your family. Say it. Say you killed them! - Say it! - It was an accident! Oh, accidents happen, right? Please don't do this. I'm so sorry. Say it! - Say it. - Please, please don't do this! Say. It. Night night, motherfucker. No! I'm nervous. Hey. Whatever happens, we'll get through it together. - Okay? - Okay. Gonna be fine. Okay. I'll give you guys a moment. Hi. Hey, sis. You look great. Thank you. What are you doing here? Today's kind of a big deal for you, right? It's really good to see you. But... Mm, but? You know I've always been able to see through your bullshit. Bullshit. Why are you really here, Jax? I can't just... be your support here? Um... I... I got into a little bit of trouble. What do you mean? I've... The... the university... they set me up with a summer job, right, at a tech firm in London. And they assigned me to the vice president of R and D. We hit it off, and she made a request that I stay on as like, a summer-fall intern. What did you do? Eventually, she taught me about stock options, and... I... I just thought it was, like, an easy way to make money. Yeah, it is. When you know all of the answers beforehand. I know. I'm pretty fucked right now. Okay? I lost all my income. And it... the... They kicked me out of college, and I... I'm on the end of this, stipend from my trust fund. And I hate to do this, but I just need a little bit of help from you right now, okay? - Ju-just... - I can't. Jax, I love you. Okay? I love you. But I don't like who you are. I don't like who you've become after Mom and Dad have died. You don't mean that. Life has given you so many opportunities. To have an amazing education. To... to have a relationship with me, who loves you so much. And has bailed you out of so much. You had a second chance at life, Jax. And every opportunity you get, you blow. Please. Please. Like, I... I promise I'll be so much better... I love you. You're my brother. And you've never told me "thank you". You've never said "I love you". I can't do it. I... I promise, I'll be better... You need to grow up. Because what are you gonna do without me someday? If I save you from this mess, what is that gonna do for you? You need to figure this shit out. Hey. I love you, don't forget it. April? The judge is ready to see you now. You okay? Yeah. Ms Davis. In conjunction with your plea agreement, you are hereby given a suspended sentence of five years, for three cases of vehicular manslaughter. The great state of Texas does not take distracted driving and the deaths of innocent people lightly. During this period, you will report to County Probation each month. The dates will be arranged by your assigned probation officer. Within six months of this date, you will attend a three-month alcohol abuse education program. Additional terms are that you abstain from any type of alcoholic beverage, submit to an alcohol and narcotics urinalysis when requested, and perform 500 hours of community service during the course of your probation. Do you understand these requirements? Yes, Your Honor, I do. Ms Davis, up until your accident, you had a crystal-clean record. You've been given a second chance. You complete your probationary period, and the three counts of vehicular manslaughter will be dismissed. Do you agree to these terms? Stand up. Yes, Your Honor. Thank you. Thank you, Your Honor. Now look, April. You've been given another chance at life. I need you to make the best of it. Thank you. - Mm. - For everything. Yes. No. No, I love you more. Actually, yes. A little more than that. Okay, maybe not that much. I'm kidding! No, I love you most. It's just factual. Okay. Okay. I love you. I'll see you when you get home. Bye. No. Night night, sleep tight. Night night, sleep tight. Night night, sleep tight. Night night, sleep tight. April? April? April! A... pril? April. April, you in there? April, you... You down there?
