[dramatic music] Operator? [growling] [barking] [woman screaming] [barking] [music continues] [gasps] "Sandy.. "Sandy, read this note aloud. This is a holdup." [dogs barking] [music continues] Come on, girls. Give us a hand. [music continues] [music continues] [upbeat music] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [indistinct singing] [sighing] Oh, there you go, Luther. That oughta do it. Thanks. [crickets chirping] Well, now that you got no further need of me I'm gonna clean my rifle before Mr. Prescott and the guest gets here. I've got further need of you. You can help me dish up this fancy stuff. [inhaling] [sighing] Well, it sure smells great. I could smell it cookin' all the way down at the lake. Yeah, it ought to smell great. Meat prices what they is. Say, how much you reckon a hunk of meat like that costs? - Beats me. - Well, it costs plenty. Believe you, me. Say, look, if you ain't gonna help none you may as well go clean that rifle. Them friends of Mr. Prescott's eats like this out in the woods. What do you suppose they eats like when they're at home? Food's important to people like them. 'Sometimes they get in their airplane and they fly' all the way over to the next state just to get a hamburger. Well, they might as well.. 'What are you looking at?' Thought I heard somethin'. Mr. Prescott, that ain't you out there already, is it? No, he wouldn't be comin' in today. [dramatic music] [dogs barking] [snarling] My God. What the hell are they doin' here? - I don't know. - Well, they're after somethin'. [dogs barking] It's the meat. They smell the meat. Well, give it to 'em! I can't give 'em Mr. Prescott's meat, Jimbo. You got a rifle. You gotta do somethin'. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'll give 'em it. I'll take care of 'em. [barking] Give them the meat, Luther. 'Hurry!' [music continues] [gunshot] [gunshots] Damn. Just like they planned it. Well, at least they left Mr. Prescott the beans and the radishes. [instrumental music] Who is that? Looks like somebody new is moved in the old homestead. Well, that's Peggy. She's 22. Been here just a week. Drives a red MG. Loves Neil Diamond. Crazy about mushroom pizza, works at an ad agency and plays tennis. Strong backhand. Man, I can't wait to ask you some questions about her next week. Warren, any questions you have about her I can answer right now. Hey did you guys see the one who just moved into 4B? That blonde? Yeah. Love that type. Trouble with you, Warren, is you've got no class. It's the company I keep. 'Oh, now, that's the kinda company I'd like to keep.' You could keep that kind of company every day in the week.. ...if you just hit an oil well or inherit some money. Or find those dobermans everyone's looking for. Hey, yeah. Three hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Do you believe that dogs rob a bank of that much money? You're really hung up on that doberman story, aren't you? A bunch of dogs bust a bank and get away with it. You bet I'm hung up on it. Hey, guys, you know, I bet you if we put our minds to it that we could find them. Hah! What I could do with $350,000. There's a lots of people up in the woods lookin' for those dogs. Now that means that the loot is probably still on them. [sighing] That's a lot of bread. It's more money than I can make in 15 years. [laughing] Yeah, and that's just as an aerospace engineer. Imagine how long it would take in your present occupation. Standing in the unemployment line. [instrumental music] [dogs barking] [male #1 on walkie] 'Yes, Garrett. Any news yet?' [Garrett] 'Negative, sir.' [male #1] 'Garrett, what the hell is wrong' 'with the ranger service?' 'Can't any of you field guys' 'manage to find five Doberman pinschers?' 'They've been running around loose in that sector' 'over a week now.' [Garrett] 'Sir, those dogs are smart.' [male #1] 'Garrett, what are you telling me?' 'That five Doberman pinschers are smarter than you are?' Well, no, sir. [male #1] 'They're only dogs, Garrett.' 'Now, find 'em. Out.' [engine rumbling] [instrumental music] [music continues] [knocking on door] - Hi. - Come on in, Warren. I know it's late-- Yeah, we were just talking about it. - The dobermans? - Mm-hmm. - What is this, ESP? - Nope. Raw greed. Okay, you said we could find those dogs. How? [scoffs] Sheriffs can't find 'em. The rangers can't find 'em. There's a whole army of amateurs can't find them. - 'What's so special about us?' - Calm down, will ya? Tell him, Greg. Hey, we don't find the dobermans. The dobermans find us. What? Those dogs robbed a bank in a highly trained in a precision way. Somebody was controlling 'em. Somebody who could see everything that was goin' on and had some method to make them react. Warren, ever hear of ultrahigh frequency sound waves? Well, it's a scientific fact, that there are sound waves pitched so high, the human ear can't hear them. But dogs can. [Greg] 'That's how whoever planned these things' controlled the dobermans. Wow! Uh, w-what does that mean? Uh, what, do we race around the woods like three elves blowing on little whistles that only dogs can hear? Come on, come on, get serious, will ya? We do it electronically. Now, Greg has come up with a gimmick that just might call the dogs in for us. You see, Warren, now, we don't know exactly which pitches the dogs have been trained to respond to. So, instead of going around ourselves blowing a bunch of differently pitched whistles we're gonna use an oscillator. 'And it'll play a bunch of pitches' up and down the scale. And maybe, just maybe, the dogs will react to one of them. Far out. Of course, we could do it the simple way. Just go into the woods and say [whistles] "Here, boy. Here, boy." Three hundred and fifty grand. [Greg] Hey, wait a minute, guys. Now, I'm not guaranteeing you that this thing will work. I mean, this is just a chance. A crap shoot. Well, it's worth it. Hey, how do we work this electronic gadget of yours? We pack it in on our backs? [instrumental music] [music continues] [Warren] About got that contraption together? [Greg] Yup. It won't be long now. You really think we're gonna find 'em? Sure. Why not? Trick is to find them before somebody else does. [scoffs] Yeah. Okay, if you guys will come over here I'll show you how this thing works. Okay. Alright, it's on. - It's on? - It really is on. Can you change the pitch? Okay. From here on, we'll just leave it on. Every couple of minutes, we'll change the pitch then we'll go into the variations you figured out and we go back and do it all again, okay? Okay. You mean, the dogs can really hear something? If they're within a couple of miles, they can. [Warren] 'Huh, that's terrific.' [Steve] 'Hey, wait a minute. Who is that?' Turn it off. So, somebody comes around they won't hear anything unless they're dogs. Yeah, what if the dobermans just choose that moment to come visiting us, huh? Turn it off and cover it up. [birds chirping] - Hi. - Hi. We're just headed home down the hill and we thought you might have a drink of water. Better than that. How about a beer? Speaking strictly for myself, I don't mind at all. - Goes for me too. - Two beers coming right up. What brings you up in the hills? Oh, just camping out, you know. What about you? Us, we've been up here hunting those doberman dogs. The ones robbed that bank a couple of weeks of ago. - We've been readin' about that. - Did you find anything? Just a bunch of people looking for dobermans. [laughing] Well, if you fellows don't mind we'll finish these on our way home. - Sure. - So long. Boy, you fellas sure know how to camp. [dramatic music] [music continues] [crickets chirping] [Greg] Wow, what a great evening, huh? Yeah, I wish I was spending it with somebody prettier than you guys. I'm gettin' tired. I think I'll turn in. Yeah, I guess it's time we made arrangements for the night. Who's going to take the first watch? Watch? Well, sure, you don't think we're gonna close up shop for the night, do you? I mean, somebody's gotta be awake in case those dobermans come in. I mean, if we're all asleep in there, you don't think they're gonna come in and knock on the door to be let in, do you? Hey.. [instrumental music] [dogs barking] [music continues] Hey, there's a perfect place for them. A little cave. Let's check it. [music continues] They're not in here. Let's go. [music continues] [Steve sighing] Are you sure that thing's puttin' out? I'm sure. But we've covered about every area the dogs have been reported in. I mean, if they're around, they sure must be hard of hearing. - Look, I didn't guarantee it. - Yeah. Well, chalk up another triumph for our electronics expert. No kidding, Greg, that, uh that machine of yours is really dynamite. What's next? A treasure hunt to Sierra Madre? Or-or maybe we could find a lost gold mine. Think you can get the machine to do that, Greg? 'Dobermans. I tell ya.' 'If I never hear of dobermans again the rest of my life' it'll be too soon. Fool ourselves into thinkin' that.. [dramatic music] Don't make any sudden moves, anybody. Here, boy, here, boy, here.. 'Hey, it worked.' - Hello. Hello. - Here, boy. Here, boy. [Steve] Come here. Hey, it worked. Hey, if there was something in here, it's gone now, man. They've chewed the hell out of these satchels. Yeah, this one doesn't even have one. [Steve] This one was probably torn by the bushes. - Here, here, boy. - Hey, wait a minute. - Here, boy. - What's that over there? Here, boy. Uh, there it is. I don't know how much it is, I gotta count it. - But wait, here's more. - Give me it. Oh! Look at that! - Here! Here. - Put the dogs in the camper. - I'll count it - Okay. - Count the money. - I will. I will. Come on, boy. Come on. Yeah, I got them. I got it. Come on. - Come on, boy. - Come on, boy. - Go on! - Get in there. Get in there. [Warren] Come on. Come on, boy. - Come on, into the camper. - Come on, come on. Into the camper, go on. Get in there. Come on. That's the way. - Come on. Come on. - Atta boy! [Warren] Atta boy! - How much we got? - Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Fifty eight thousand bucks. More than 19,000 bucks apiece. Nineteen thousand dollars! Woo-hoo! - Not a bad chunk of dough. Wow! - Right. Well, let's get to town and start to spend it, huh? Yeah, 'course, it's not as much as a third of 350,000. Well, the dogs didn't bring 350,000. Come on, what do you say, Steve, we gonna let the dogs loose or what? Now, wait a minute, wait a minute. Letting those dogs loose is like eating the wrapper and throwing the candy away. [chuckles] You're right. You're right. Oh, come on, you guys, what more do you want? A lot more, Warren. We got the key to the vault in that camper. Well.. What is this? The dogs, Warren. We got the dogs. Right. Now, listen. We can do with those dogs what the other guys did. - The guys that robbed the bank. - We can't be-be bustin' a bank. [Steve] Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Now, we can't rob a bank. They'll catch us if we do that. We gotta think of something else. We gotta think of something else to bust. Man, it doesn't matter what we bust. They're gonna nail us. The dogs are the perfect weapon. Total remote control. Right, see? We got no connection with the dogs. If something goes wrong, they nail the dogs, not us. Listen, if, if something goes wrong the dogs are gonna talk, and they'll name us. I don't believe it. You guys are nuts! Come on, Warren. Are you in or out? What do you say, Warren? [chuckles] I'm in. [instrumental music] [Warren] 'Where in the heck are we?' [Greg] 'Boy, you sure got us out here in the boondocks.' [Steve] 'There's an old shack out here we can live in for a few weeks.' [Warren] 'Somebody's gonna see us, with all these dogs.' [Steve] 'Nah. Nobody lives around here for miles.' [music continues] [music continues] [Steve] 'It'll do fine, when we get it livable.' [Warren] 'Livable? Who for?' [Steve] 'Well, somebody has to stay here with the dogs' 'until we can get things organized.' [Warren] 'Not me, man.' 'Place looks like an apartment for swingin' snakes.' [Steve] 'Hey, the sooner we get the place cleaned up' 'the sooner we can start finding out about the dogs.' I don't know, man. Come on, boy. I'm saying, it'd be better if we knew who these dogs were, you know. - Why don't we give them names? - Yeah, that's a good idea. Matter of fact, we might even give them two names. That way, uh, if you're worried about their being caught they'd have an alias, already. - Okay, what do we call 'em? - I don't know. What do you call a dog? - Well, I got it. - What? This one's Fido. This one's Rover. - Okay, and this one is Prince. - Yeah. - And Spot, and Rex. - Terrific. - Great. - Okay, Prince, Spot, Rex. - Let's go. - Come on, Fido and Rover. Let's go. Get in the house! [dogs barking] [whimpering] Okay, it's ready. Now, let's see what they react to. [barking] Wow! Look at that. Hey, hey, do another one. Yeah, let's see what this one does. [Steve] 'Talk about Jekyll and Hyde.' Well, logically, I think that's about it. From snarl to threaten, then back off. Now, I'd say, they only had two main signals. [growling] Hey, switch it off! Switch it off! [sighing] Change that to three main signals. - You, uh, you okay? - Yeah, yeah, I guess so. Wow! Did you see that? 'A dog like that could kill you.' [Steve] That's just the point. That's why they're so terrific for this job. - 'They're perfect.' - Dynamite! And you know what? They're gonna make us a lot of money. - Somehow. - Yeah, but the point is "How?" Well, obviously, we gotta find a place with a lot of cash. How about Vegas? There's a lot of cash there. And more guards, and electronic equipment than you could ever imagine. Fort Knox would be easier. Well, what then? If only we could find a place where they wouldn't really expect us. You know? Someplace where they had a lot of cash lying around that they wouldn't be too anxious to report if it were missing. 'Unreported income.' You mean, like the mafia? - Hey, hey! - No, no, no! We wouldn't live three days. [sighing] I don't know what it'll be. We just gotta.. ...gotta think about it. [Warren] Don't forget the dog food. Ah, give the dogs a damn steak, will you? We'll be back by tomorrow noon. Hang in there, Warren. [instrumental music] [engine starting] [dogs whimpering] [music continues] [Warren] 'Hey.' Who are you? Come here. What the hell are you doing around here? You know what you're supposed to get? Yeah, I got a list. How about you? Yeah, I made a list too, so, if we get everything done why don't we take in that party that Marcie is supposed to be giving. Hey-hey! Alright. I'll see you later. See you later. [upbeat music] [indistinct chatter] [indistinct chatter] - Guess what? - Uh, excuse me? - Uh, there you go. - Oh, thank you. - I hope the lady likes tonic. - Hey. Thank you, buddy. Hey, listen. I want you to meet a really neat person-- Uh, uh, no names, please. Uh, we like to keep our relationships uninvolved here at the Casa Terrania. Uh, blood types only. Uh, Type "B." How do you do? "O" Positive. Great. Well, it was nice meeting you, Type "B." Get outta here, man. You're not my type. So, anyway, here's the thing.. Hey, Marcie, uh, who's that lady that Steve's with? Hmm, I haven't the faintest idea. [laughs] They come and they go. Yeah. [dogs whining] Mr. Warren? What? What is it? Good morning, Mr. Warren. It's 6 o'clock. Hey. Look, kid, I told you, it'd be okay to come and help with the dogs. But it's 6 o'clock. I'm sorry, Mr. Warren. But this morning I had to help my grandfather wash the clothes. Tomorrow, I'll try to be earlier, I promise. Look, Billy. We don't have to start this early in the morning. I mean, uh, it's too cold out for the dogs, you know. But they want to go out now. Well, you don't think they know what's best for them, do you? [scratching] [whimpering] Oh, yeah. Well, I'll tell you what. You take 'em out for a while and I'll rustle up some breakfast. Wait a minute. Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Here, put that on 'em. Take them out, one at a time. They won't leave. Yeah, but, I'm not taking any chances. One at a time. - They're also hungry. - Yeah? I've got food. Got steak. Look at that. Won't have dog food till later. You like steak? I don't know. Well, I tell you what. I'll just cut you off a couple of these and you can take 'em home when you leave, huh? But it's for the dogs. There's enough. You really appreciate that, don't you? Yeah. [car honking] [Warren] Hi. - Where's Steve? - Don't know. I don't think you're gonna believe it. What do you mean? Well, he, uh.. Hey, who is that? Oh, he's an Indian kid. His name's Billy. Well, what's he doing here? I told him he could help out with the dogs. He lives up in the hills with an old man, his grandfather. What about Steve, man? Here, help me take some of this stuff out. Oh, for the dog kennels. Yeah. We finally got it. Anyway, after we got through, we stopped over at Marcie's. - And she was having this party. - Uh-huh. By the way, she's sorry that you couldn't make it. - Uh-huh. - And, uh.. Steve got hitched up with this lady named Claudia. Lady? You mean, uh, lady? Huh, she looked like she was on the other side of 40 to me. Wow! That doesn't sound like the great lover's type. No, it doesn't, you know it sounded kinda strange to me, too. Uh, he stayed with her all night long, right by her side. And they left together. I haven't seen him since. Huh, that's weird. That's not like him. Well, you know, before I left, I called every place that I knew but he wasn't there. So I waited around a little bit, then I got it all together and I said I better come on back. [hammering] Okay, Billy boy! Let's see how they like their new home. Hey, he seems to like it alright. Looks like he's lived that way before. Yeah. Go get the rest of them, Billy. Now, I tell you, you might as well head on home after that. - Yes, Mr. Warren. - Oh, don't forget the, uh.. - Don't, uh, forget anything. - No, Mr. Warren. - Okay. - I won't. Come on, boy. Yeah. Good boy. Two whole days. Where the hell is he? What's he doin'? Well, I can guess what he's doing but I couldn't tell you where he's doing it. [laughing] We haven't lost that much time. Now, he could have been here helping. Is that all the dishes? [car honking] Ah, the return of Casanova. Huh. Now, we get the full treatment. "Gee, fellas, I, I wanted to get here sooner, but, uh this pressing matter came up, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!" Yeah, I wonder what he's gonna have to say. Huh. Okay, folks. Yes, I did have a nice ride down here. No, I can't say I'm glad to be back. And, yes, I'll be glad to tell you what I've been up to. We know what you've been up to. Oh, yeah? What's that? You been cheering up some senior citizen. 'That's very noble.' [laughing] As a matter of fact, I have been noble. I've been sacrificing myself to the common good. We talking about the same thing, Claudia? We are talking about the same thing, Claudia. Okay, would you tell us what's going on? Who's Claudia? Remember I told you we had the key? And all we have to do is find the lock? Well, Claudia is the lady who knows where the lock is. Look. Who is always collecting money that they can't say anything about? Huh? Who is always getting a lot of cash in little black suitcases? Come on, think. 'Who could be sitting on top of a pile of money' 'they wouldn't be so anxious to report' 'if it was knocked off.' Oh, come on, Steve. The mafia. We went through that. No, no. Not the mafia, Warren. Who else? The political parties. The Republicans, the Democrats, they've all done it. They've all been given money they can't say anything about. Secret campaign funds. That's right. You know, you can't pick up a newspaper without reading about it. Political parties. And Claudia is secretary to Cyrus W. Markham. And Cyrus W. Markham is campaign fund chairman. So? So in his office right now.. ...is $2 million nobody can talk about. [gasping] Hey, if nobody can talk about it, how come you know about it? I got it out of Claudia. But I don't wanna talk about it. [all laughing] Come on, let's get serious. We got a lot of work to do. But one thing the Campaign Fund Party office safe is on the ninth floor. - Ninth floor? - What? I told you we had a lot of work to do. Oh.. So, for six months, she kept saying "Stay for breakfast. Stay for breakfast." So one morning I did, she made pancakes like that I never saw her again. Funny. Huh! [dogs barking] Hey, what's with the dogs? Oh, that's, uh, what's his name, the Indian kid. [Warren] Oh, yeah, I forgot to tell you about the Indian kid. Indian? What Indian? [Warren] He lives around here some place. I found him with the dogs, they seemed to like him so, I, I kinda hired him, you know. Help to feed the dogs, stuff like that. [Steve] Think that was a good idea? - Sure! - Well, it can't hurt. [Steve] Hey, kid! - What's your name? - I'm Billy. Billy, how far away do you live? Over the hill, there. About three miles. Okay. Why don't you take the dog over there and feed him? You'll find everything you need. He lives with his grandfather. From what he says, uh, old man didn't get around much. I figured they could use the bread, you know? Yeah? We gotta be pretty careful from now on. Don't talk about, uh, anything in front of that kid. Yeah. [Claudia chuckling] 'Oh, Steve, no, oh, no..' [Steve] What if I just take this off? The whole dress comes off. - No, no, Steve, no. - Or pull at this-- You promised me dinner. Alright. Not bad for antipasto, huh? I really am hungry. Man cannot live by bread alone, Claudia. I'll be right out. [laughing] [chuckles] Oh.. [instrumental music] Say, uh, this doesn't look like a family album. [Claudia] 'No. It isn't. It's all the wheels from the parking.' Oh, you don't say. - Hey, I'm kind of impressed. - 'Oh, don't be.' [Claudia] 'Whenever they come into party headquarters' 'they like to, uh, act like we're one big happy family.' 'So they pose with all the worker bees.' Wow, here's a governor 'and a senator, and a president.' Ta-da! Ready! [Steve] 'You look terrific!' - Sensational. No kidding. - Oh, thank you. You look pretty good in this, uh, picture too. Who's this guy standing next to you? Oh, that's Cyrus Markham. Campaign fund chairman string puller supreme and my boss. Looks okay for a boss. You look okay, too, but looks can be deceiving. Told you, babe, judge on surfaces alone. - Now, can we go eat? - Sure. - First things first. - Oh, now, you get the point. And don't forget, second things second. Oh, you are awful. You know, I think, really-- I know a little place that serves nothing but aphrodisiacs. - Where? - Wait till you see the menu. [Claudia] I don't plan to.. I plan to.. [Steve] 'So that's basically the story, Mr. Winston.' 'We're moving into four floors' 'of the biggest building in town.' 'And we wanna employ the services' of the best interior decorator in town. Well, that's lovely, Mr. Crandall. It's so wonderful to know that your work has met with such approval that your name and fame have spread as far as, uh.. - Dallas. Yes. - Dallas. [chuckles] Well, now, could you tell me a little about the kind of business? Well, I'm afraid that's impossible at this moment. You see, we wanna be absolutely as quiet as we can until we're ready. Yes, I see, but I don't see how can I be of any help-- Well, right now I'm here just gathering information. So all I need from you is some of your ideas. Uh, maybe some decorator plans from offices you've designed for other companies? [laughs] Oh, my dear. I do have some sketches of things I've done and some before-and-after kind of pictures but I'm afraid that's all I have. Oh, no, that's fine, as long as they're of different companies. Yes, well, let's see. Look at that. Isn't that heaven, the fountain in the shape of lips? And this was an old law office but the head of the firm was an ardent sailor. - So I did that. - That's terrific. I've never seen an office with rigging before. Well, that's what makes some of us furniture buyers and some of us artists. What's this one, this red, white and blue one? Oh, that was to be the permanent offices of some political party. Unfortunately, they never did that one. This is the one they did. Oh? Say, I've got an idea. Uh, would you mind my keeping these for a couple of days? I'd like to show them to my partners as an example of your work. Please. Keep them as long as you'd like. Well, thank you. Thank you very much. Yes, I think this is going to be exactly what we need. Do come back, Mr. Crandall. Soon. You'll be hearing from me, Mr. Winston. Ambrose. Yes. [instrumental music] [engine revving] [Greg] 'We're gonna move in through here?' [Steve] Well, I-I think here would be better. [Warren] Yeah, and then straight, right. Yeah. [Greg] Alright, then in through here to the offices. [Steve] Mm-hmm. I don't know, man, don't you think we're expecting too much of those dogs? How the hell are we gonna get 'em up there? It's the ninth floor. I mean, shouldn't we figure a way to to be there give them signals? Otherwise, it's impossible. No, the dogs have got to do it without help, Warren. You know, we could plant some kind of electronic device on them, give them cues. - Yeah. - No. No cues. No people, no nothing. The dogs have gotta go up to the ninth floor by themselves pick up the money by themselves, and come down by themselves. Okay. Man, you really got something against those people. That's just where the money is, that's all. I'm totally non-partisan. When it comes to taking it from them I'll give each party equal time. Now, look at this. How are we gonna get from here to here? Yeah. Huh. Greg.. ...if you figure out the exact distances and we start teaching those dogs how to jump.. Yeah, okay, now, one is 16 feet five inches and here it's 16 feet eight inches. [whistles] Well, I guess 18 feet should cover 'em both, huh? Right. Right. Okay, where do you want us to start? Well, seems to me that, uh the dog should get a galloping start down there and, and jump there, and we measure it and keep practicing till we hit 18 feet. - Okay. - That does it. We're all set. You're going to teach the dogs to jump, Mr. Steve? [chuckles] That's right. They already know how to jump pretty good. Well, they gotta do better than pretty good. It's gotta be great. And every time. Okay, Greg, give it a run. The dogs don't know what you want them to jump. Oh. Hey, wait a minute. Yeah. - Okay, Spot. - That's a good idea. Try it now, Steve. Okay. You ready? Come on, Spot, this way, come on. - Jump! - Hey! - Yeah. That wasn't bad, huh? - That's a little better. - That's it. - Yeah. - I'll get the rest of the dogs. - Okay. [instrumental music] [music continues] Tryin' to make a list of some of the things we're gonna need. Yeah? What you got? The first thing we're gonna need is a big truck of some kind. Well, that's no sweat. We can rent one of those. [Steve] I wonder where that Indian kid goes at night. Home to grandpa. Yeah, I know that, but...I wonder where home is. When he left this evening, I took the binoculars and tried to follow him. Oh, yeah? Yeah, he just cut out over the hills. Home must be two miles from here. Oh, that's just to the hills, he probably lives further than that. Hmm. [instrumental music] Billy, ain't you gonna take some food with you? It's alright, grandpa.

[engine revving] [dogs whining] - Hi, Billy. - Hi. You really like hanging around these kennels, don't you? Yeah. How come, I mean, uh how come you like to spend so much time here? Is it the money? Well, why, then? - The dogs. - Really? You mean, if we stopped paying you 50 cents a day you'd still come around? [laughs] No kidding? Well, don't worry. We're not gonna do that. We'll still pay you the money. Well, since you really like these dogs let's give 'em a workout, alright? - What's this dog's name? - Fido. Fido, eh? Okay, Fido, let's do some jumping. Come on. [instrumental music] - How'd you do? - Great. I think we got everything we need to start for sure. May need a few things later. - Okay. Let's unload it. - Alright, Steve. [instrumental music] [music continues] Where's the saw? Oh, there it is. [exhales] Well, I guess we're almost finished. Hey, you know, we could rig up some kind of floodlight system and work at night. It'd be a lot faster. [panting] They'd see us for miles around too. Nah. What about what we're doin' here? - They won't see us out here. - Well, maybe you're right. Maybe I could go into town and get some stuff and rig somethin' up. Yeah. Hey, let's get down and see how the dogs are jumping. [grunts] Oh. Hey, Steve, you know, I've been thinking. Yeah? How will the dogs go recognizing people on the ninth floor? That's a good point. Do dogs recognize faces? I don't know, but why take a chance. You know, Claudia's got an album with people from the office party, things like that. Hey, that's great, you can romance her out of it and pick up the lights at the same time. I have a lot to do here. I can't go in yet. [Steve] Hey, how's it goin'? I don't believe this. All of a sudden, we got Olympic champions on our hands. - Look at that. - Eighteen feet, seven inches? - No kidding. - Far out! - They're really jumpin'! - Well, let's see 'em do it. - Yeah, here. - Okay. Oh, wipe out the, uh, jump off marks. - You guys all set? - Yeah. Huh. Go, jump! - Wow! Beautiful! Beautiful! - Good dog. Good dog. Come here. Okay, Billy, put the end of the tape where he took off from. Hold it tight. Nineteen feet, four inches! - I can't believe it! - Spectacular! - Let's try the next one. - Right. [Warren] Okay. Alright. Go! Jump! [grunts softly] Okay. Hold the tape, Billy. Wow! That's over 20 feet.. Hey. What the hell are you doing? - Huh? - What's the matter? [Warren] What is it? I just found out why the dog is suddenly doing so much better. That kid wants 'em to do well so he is cheating on the take-off marks. 'Look, see? That's where the dog actually took off.' 'And that's where the kid marked it.' 'That's a cheat of about a foot!' Look, kid, I'm warning you do that one more time and you're out. Steve, uh, let me explain it to him. Billy, this probably looks, uh kinda strange to you but, uh, th-these are rescue dogs. 'Yeah, and we're trainin' them, see, to, to help people' 'who might be stranded in a, in a desert' or in, in the woods, you know? Yeah, yeah, you know, you wouldn't want, uh one of them to jump off a gully or something 'and fall in, would you?' Oh, no. Well, you see, it's really important that the measurements are true, right? I understand. I'm sorry. [chuckles] Okay. Okay, let's get back to work. We're not as far along as we thought. [instrumental music] [gasps] Oh, hi, Steve. Hi. Here. It's your favorite. Oh. Oh, well, I'll, I'll just put it on ice. How was your trip? Well, you know how those trips are. Yeah. I guess it was alright. [music continues] - Uh, how have you been? - Fine. Well...almost fine. What's the matter? What do you mean, almost? Steve, I-I've been doing a lot of thinking about us. Really? You're...29. [laughs] That's right. There you go with that old math again. Well, I-I just can't afford this kind of casual...relationship. Uh, Steve, I-I want to call it off. I thought you cared about me. Yeah, well, it's just that I.. I care too much, I'm, I'm.. I'm...too involved in a situation that's.. [scoffs] ...bound to fall apart, it has-- It won't. I care about you. - I'm happy with you, Claudia. - I mean it, Steve. I, I, I don't think we should see each other again. I.. I-I want it to stop now. You mean now? You mean right now? I mean I want you to walk out of the door and that's it. [music continues] Boy.. ...that's a lot to hit me with. That's a.. Sure a lot to digest. Please, Steve. [laughing] You want to hear something funny? This will give you a laugh. You know, when I came here tonight, uh.. [dramatic music] This is very difficult for me to say I've never said this before. I wanted ours to be a permanent relationship. - Steve, I want you to go. - We should get married. Oh, yeah, wouldn't that be wonderful for a year or two and then my face and figure and everything would go including you. - That's not true. - Yes, it is. That's not true. [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] Okay, Fido. Up. Up. Good boy. Hey, Billy, you're back. Roll over. Roll over. Alright. Good boy. We missed you yesterday. Sick? No...funeral. One of our elders died. We had a day of mourning. Oh. Sorry. Say, uh, when did you teach Fido those tricks? Early in the mornings. I, I didn't mean anything. Listen, Billy, these dogs have a hard job in front of them. They've a lot to learn. Let's not confuse 'em, you know. Don't teach 'em anything more. And, uh.. Don't tell, don't tell anybody else about this, you understand? I understand. Okay, kid, let's go. We have a big day in front of us. Hey, did you get everything? Yeah. The lights are in the car. - Here's the album. - Oh, good. - You have much trouble? - That's a long story. - What's happening? - Oh, the door bit. Trying to get Prince to go through. - So? - So far, we gotta drag him. Well, he's gotta do it himself. Don't you get it, the dogs have gotta do the whole damn thing by themselves. Okay, this school's gonna get a little tougher. Here. Give me the dog. Let me run him. [dog whining] [barking] [Steve] Come on, come on, come on. [barking] [whimpering] [Steve] 'Okay, from now on, that's the way it's gotta go.' You know, getting tough may be the answer. 'Cause Prince just isn't makin' it. He's gotta start makin' it. Maybe we should let Billy work 'em out for a while. You know, the dogs really come on when he works 'em. You know, Billy isn't gonna be around to pull this thing off. Besides, I think it's about time we started talking about getting rid of him. - Oh? - What do you mean? When we get down to the final strokes on this thing I don't want that kid around. 'He's bright.' 'He's gonna figure out somethin'.' [Warren] 'Oh, I think he believes that rescue story. Training bit.' Hey, I don't know what he believes. I just know that he can't find out anything if he's not here, huh? [Warren] 'So what are we gonna do about Prince?' [Greg] 'Heh. Well, we're just gonna keep stretching him out.' [Steve] 'He'll be okay, man.' [Greg] 'Hey, you think we about ready?' I don't know. I guess we're about ready for the last phase. I want those dogs working like five pieces of a Swiss watch. [chuckles] Hmm. Okay, run 'em! [instrumental music] [music continues] Alright, boy. Good boy. Good boy. Hey, why can't that mutt turn left with the others? Guess we'll have to try a little harder. Hey, I think he's about had it for today. I know I have. [chuckles] Not a bad day, you know? Not a bad day at all. - Yeah, I guess so. - 'Alright, good boy.' The only thing we've got left to figure out is how are we gonna distract the receptionist while the dogs go by? - Yeah. - Huh? Yeah. Alright! Heh. Whoa. Hey, I got just the thing. - Really? - Yeah. Yeah. Let me call Billy. - Billy! - What's he got to do with it? Don't get bugged, man. Wait till I show you what he can do. Billy, bring Fido over here. 'Yeah, hurry up.' Okay, kid. Here's your chance to be a superstar. Show us the tricks that you taught Fido. It's okay? It's okay. Now, watch this. Sit up. Good boy. Good boy. Good. Now, do another one. Roll over. [Greg laughing] Okay, do the other one. Beg. [chuckles] Where did he learn how to do that? Uh-huh? Will it work or won't it? [Steve] 'I don't know. If we can teach him to do it without a signal..' - Well, why not? - Sure. It'll be easy. Fido is very smart. He sure is. [tuning radio] [upbeat music on radio] [sighing] You really like that kid, don't you, Warren? [Warren] Yeah. Yeah, he's just a kid, but.. [chuckles] ...he's pretty bright. You said it, he's bright. He's too damn bright. I think it's time we got him outta here. I hate to say it but I've been thinking the same thing. - Oh, I've thought about it. - Look, man, this is it. We're going into the final training. Straight run-throughs of the whole thing. It's graduation time for those dogs. And so far, the kid has only seen pieces of the puzzle but we're gonna put this whole thing together and he is too smart not figure out somethin'. Yeah, I guess so. It's gonna be awful tough on the kid. He really loves those dogs. [Steve] Now, we can't help it. So you gotta tell him, Warren, or I will. I'll tell him. I'll...I'll tell him in the morning. You better make it stick. Right. Right. [instrumental music] Hi, Billy. How's he doin'? He's ready, Mr. Warren. And Prince will jump well today. He told me so. Listen, Billy. Uh, I have some kind of bad news for you. You can't come here anymore. I can't see the dogs again? No. Not after today. Yeah, s-see, it's the dogs. They, uh, th-they depend on you too much. You-you're like a distraction. Uh, they pay too much attention to you. Now, they have a lot to do, a-a-and they can't afford to have their minds off their work. I'll stay away from them. I'll clean their kennels, I won't touch 'em. They won't see me. - Please, Mr. Warren. - No! Damn it. Now, Billy, don't make this hard. Just, just get on out of here. Maybe it's better now than later. Here's.. Here's $20. [music continues] Take the money, Billy. Here. Take this money. Take the money, damn it! You dumb kid! [barking] Well, to hell with you! Hey, uh, Steve, you never told us how you got this. There's nothing for you to know. - I stole it. - Oh. You're really getting some bad habits, man. Stealing photo albums from people. Next thing you know, you'll be stealing money. - Ha-ha-ha. I hope so. - Yeah, me too. Hey, what do you think? We about ready? Yeah, yeah, I think we are ready for a complete run-through from the top. You hear that, Mr. Markham? 'In a few days one of our representatives' 'will be calling on you for a little donation.' [laughter] [instrumental music] Hey, ready? - Yeah. All set. - Ready. Okay. [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] Are the dogs rotating alright? [barking] Not yet. They've got everything under control. [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] 4:27. Well, that's it! We are ready. Far out! Far out! Wow! We're gonna do it. We're gonna do it. What time you think you guys will be back? Oh, I don't know. Pick up the uniforms, get the truck.. I'd say about 6 o'clock. - Okay. - See you then. Right. [engine starting] [revving] Hi. Fido. Hello. Shh. Hi, Prince. [dogs whimpering] Shh. [dog barking] Billy, what the hell are you doing here? I thought I told you to stay away, didn't I? I know, Mr. Warren, but the dogs.. I just wanted to see the dogs. We've been through all of this. Now you get on out of here. And don't ever let anybody catch you around here again! Now go on. Split. Go on, split! 'Billy, go on. Now!' [dog whimpering] Alright, Mr. Warren. [dog whimpering] Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Let's make a deal. If I, if I let you take 'em out one more time.. ...just, to, to say good-bye will you promise me to stay away? Could I? Yeah, go on. But this is it. Remember, this is the last time. Now, don't go too far. [dog barking] [upbeat music] [snake rattling] [dog barking] [dramatic music] Oh, no! Prince! Prince! Mr. Warren! Mr. Warren! [music continues] - What is it? - Prince. What's wrong? Where's the dog? [Warren] Oh! [dog whimpering] A rattler. I can see that. [instrumental music] Give me the rag. [car approaching] This better work. Hey, Warren, I think we got almost every.. Hey, what's goin' on? What the hell is this? What's he doing here? - Steve, something's happened. - What? A snake. A rattler got him. Oh, no. All that training. - How, Warren? - 'Well--' [Steve] 'Hey, wh-what are you doing, kid?' This is a cure my people use for snakebite. The herbs draw out the poison. I figured it was worth a try. I mean, I couldn't call a vet, or anything. Okay, but, but how did it happen? Did a snake get in the kennel or what? [Warren] 'No, it was my fault.' 'I let the kid take one last romp with the dog.' - Oh. - Look, man. - I know it was wrong. I'm sor-- - Wrong? It was really dumb, man! 'It was stupid. Dumb! Wrong isn't even the word.' You've blown the whole operation. Maybe not. We'll just have to wait and see. [dramatic music] [music continues] [dog whimpering] Prince! Prince! Prince, you're gonna be well! - Is he alright? - He looks better. - He is better. - Okay. Now, is there anything else you have to do to make him well? No. The herbs drew out the poison. Good. Okay, you come with me, kid. Hey, I said come with me. - Steve. Steve-- - Wait a minute. You stay inside. I'll handle it this time. Get out! You were told never to come around here again. All this wouldn't have happened if you hadn't come back! [barking] Why don't you take a last look at those dogs. You hear what I said? One last look! I'm gonna tell you once, and not again. Get out and don't come back! [dog whimpering] Never! Get out! Get out of here and don't ever come back! [dogs barking] [instrumental music] Come on. Come on. - You got it? - Yeah. - Well, here's hopin' it works. - It's got to. It's gonna go just as we planned. In a couple of hours, we'll be splitting two million bucks. - Hah! - "It pays to keep clean." I think we oughta change that to "We clean up." [engine starting] [Warren] Okay. [instrumental music] [instrumental music] Okay, guys, put the satchels on the dogs, okay? [music continues] Time to go to work. [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] Well, here we go. [music continues] - Okay, check the note. - Sit. Sit. - It's okay. - Give it to him. [music continues] - All set. - Okay. Sit. Stay. [music continues] Make sure you press all the buttons. We don't want the dogs timing the floors wrong. Right. Okay, what the hell are we standing around for? Let's go. [dramatic music] [engine revving] [elevator bell dings] [music continues] [elevator dings] [music continues] [elevator bell dings] [barking] My God! [growling] [elevator bell dings] [music continues] [music continues] [whimpering] Hey. Hey, go on. Get out. 'Shoo! Scat.' Oh. Oh-ho-ho. Oh, isn't that adorable? [laughing] What are those little suitcases for? Oh. Ha-ha-ha. Oh, whose little doggie are you? [dramatic music] [barking] ...here in the middle, but.. [barking] Oh! Oh. Ooh.. [barking] [panting] [music continues] [barking] [knocking on door] Yes, yes. What is it? 'Claudia, I distinctly I told you I wanted to be left alone.' Absolutely.. [music continues] What are those dogs doing here? They, they brought this note. They're trained to kill, if we don't follow instructions. What nonsense! [barking] The note says "Stuff the money in their satchels. The money in the wall safe." How would they know anything about that? It also says, if we make any moves that aren't connected 'with taking the money out' 'and stuffing it in the satchels' the dogs will know it and will attack us. - That's preposterous. - And we are not to talk much. We're not to talk much. Makes them nervous. [barking] [music continues] [orchestral music] Claudia, get ready. [barking] [music continues] [barking] [music continues] Good dog. Come on, sit up. Come on, sit up like you did before. Nice dog. [music continues] - The police.. - No. No, not, not the police. We can't talk about this money to anybody. Emma, call building security and tell them to look out for those doberman dogs. 'Have them close up everything tight downstairs.' We've blocked them off down there. There's no way they can get on that main floor when it's locked. [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [whimpering] [dramatic music] [whimpering] [whimpering] [music continues] [music continues] [indistinct chatter] [male #1] What's goin on? [music continues] [barking] [music continues] Four minutes and twenty five seconds. That's about it. [Warren sighing] Oh, boy. Come on. Where are they? Maybe they got slowed up. Maybe they got nailed. How long now? Five and a half minutes. [sighing] I think we better haul it out of here, man. - 'Something's wrong.' - A little longer. [dramatic music] [music continues] Hey! It worked! Come on, let's get going. [music continues] [music continues] [engine revving] [music continues] We did it! We did it! Man's best friend. Well, it's the understatement of the world. Wow! [laughing] Great! Oh-oh, baby, there must be a million and a half or more. And nobody can report it missing. We're home free! I don't believe it! Hey, let's try it again.. There's some blood on some of this. Oh, to hell with them. They were warned. [laughing] [laughing] [dramatic music] [gear cranks] [engine revving] Okay, let's put the dogs away and go inside for a long counting session. Alright, hold it right there! FBI. Clasp your hands behind your head and do not move. FBI? They can't know. Special Investigator Blake. Before asking you any questions I must advise you of your rights. What is this? What are we supposed to have done? You're the guys who robbed the bank with the trained dobermans. Bank? Hey, we never robbed a bank. What a trail you guys left, all over the place. 'Spending money for camper equipment and rentals.' We found that money! Get over there and get your hands against the truck and spread out. - Move! - Come on, move! [dramatic music] [whistling] [dogs whining] Better take a look in that truck, Berry. Right. [barking] [gunshots] [barking] [music continues] [whistling continues] [barking] - 'Should I go after 'em?' - No. Let 'em go. We saw 'em. That's enough for court. Let's go.
