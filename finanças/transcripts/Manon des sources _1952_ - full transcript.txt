So... I've been to see the council... ...on the question of our water. There's no question about it... it's a disaster. Thanks to my own efforts, through my sound leftwing policies... and because of my telephone... we've been able to call for help... ...Help from the Rural Engineer Service... ...who sent us... The engineer Massicard, who knows our part of the world... ...even though he was originally from Paris. But he's a fount of knowledge. Over to you, Pamphile. The engineer has closely examined our situation. He's studied the terrain. And he's checked the maps. Most of all he's given it a lot of thought. Yes...he's thought a lot... I've seen him. And as is his job, he'll explain everything to us... Philox?ne, give him the floor. We shall now hear from the engineer... Rural Engineer! Yes, rural... I really did my best. Very good...bravo! Get to the point. I'll read you the report which I've sent to the Chief Engineer. He's worked all night. That's right... Just read the report. - When will the water start flowing? - Just wait! Go ahead, sir. The spring that feeds Bastides Blanches... ...at the heart of a semi-arid region... ...comes out of a fissure between two layers of limestone... ...which belong, as does the entire region... ...to the Upper Cretaceous period. The spring's origin is not diaclastic... ...but a resurgence of the Vauclusian type. Don't confuse us! There is no groundwater, or capillary action... ...as evidenced by an examination of the upper strata. He's really brainy! The permeable layer is situated between impermeable layers... ...and flush with their edge. The water trickles over the lower waterproof layer... ...but contained by the higher impermeable barrier. It pressurizes and forms a confined aquifer. Confined...that's what it is! - The resurgence has been tapped. - Trapped. No...tapped. As you wish. It was tapped 50 years ago... ...but in a very primitive manner. They 've built an absurd holding pond of just 10 cubic metres. It was only as big as they had money for. ...and only a cast-iron pipe... ...takes the water to the village, by gravity. Talking of gravity... This doesn't sound good for my tomatoes. And my carnations? Your carnations 'll drop dead. Wait now...wait... He hasn't come here for nothing. From my somewhat cursory review, it appears that the pipeline ...is in perfect condition. - I look after the pipes! Congratulations! In perfect condition... but the resurgence seems dried up. This raises the key question... What is the origin of this water? Yes...that's it! The origin is Mr Ernest Colombe. You only say that because you're a socialist red! The origin is Saint Colombe. The priest told us that. We know your priest sold out to the Americans. Americans don't need to buy priests! They've plenty of their own.. Shut up!...Be quiet! Please continue. Fortunately we are in possession of a very valuable document. Things are looking up! It's the report of the Chief Engineer... ...which summarises experiments done in this same region. That's lucky! He'll get our water back! Under our direction, all the springs of Ste-Baume... ...were dyed by means of tetraoxyphtalophenone anhydride. Cheers! Better known as fluorescein. These experiments allowed us to define... ...the isochronomatic curve... ..and which, completed by the isohydrometric curve... ...gives a perfect representation... ...of the hydrological basin. That makes me so happy! Yes...we're happy about that... If he hadn't come, who would 've told us all that? There are some who have no confidence in the administration... ...and who should learn from it. Just when will he get the water back? You be quiet! Please go on, sir. I'm sorry to have to use technical terms. Not at all...on the contrary. Go on... However, it is undisputed that the Bastides Blanches spring... ...did not show the fluoresce?ne colouring. So it does not appear on these valuable graphs. It seems impossible to integrate it ...into the geology of the Huveaune mountains or their tributaries. So what do YOU think? You look after the fountain. I'm enjoying it... But i don't understand a word. If you don't understand, you should go back to school. So I suppose YOU understand it all?! I know that every trade has its own way of talking. If he has to talk like that, it doesn't show consideration for us. I don't want to say that about him... ...but I don't understand much. I don't either... But this is the Rural Engineer! What he says is rural... so you have to have confidence. I'll put it more simply. We're looking where this water comes from. And what we've found... is where it does NOT come from! It now remains to see where it DOES come from. That's what he's going to tell us. De to the lack of moisture retention in the soil of the region... ...to a degree approaching zero... ...the source is not local. Our conclusion therefore must be... Since it's not close...it must be distant. - You can understand that!? - Yes...that's clear. - That couldn't be clearer. - On the other hand... ...as the resurgence is surrounded by parallel chains... ...of dolomites of the Jurassic range, it has to cross them at some point... ...by a siphon system. Do you know what that is? No...not THAT... Like when you suck it up with air though a rubber hose. It's the same thing. Our conclusion is clear. This is a siphon-type spring of unknown origin. Unknown?! Unknown to me. If you know more... - ...tell us all. - But what about MY spring? It's just a tributary of the one to the village... ...so it will suffer the same fate. But am I going to get my water tonight? Or even tomorrow? Don't burden US with your affairs. Just let him finish what he has to say. Please go on, sir. So we're talking about a syphoning spring system... and the consistency of its flow, which never varied before... ...seems to prove that it was fed by an underground lake. An underground lake. These who resist progress are not always right. They resist it, but are always happy to profit by it. If progress gets me my water back, I'm all for it. As soon as my spring starts flowing... ...here's 1,000 francs for progress. Just wait for what follows. What follows, will be more bullshit. We can offer two explanations for the water's sudden disappearance. Two explanations...two! As a result of drought, the level of the lake may have dropped below the primary siphon... ...where, it is hoped, when the water rises ...the siphon will be reactivated. It should be pointed out, however... ..that if this IS the case... the rise required could take a long time. The spring at Gratte-Cigale near Avignon, for example... ...flows for 7 years... then stops for 7 years. 7 years?! Is that what he said?! That's at Gratte-Cigale, up north! But it still could be the same thing here. No...it won't be the same thing... Since it's benn running 50 years... ...it may take 50 years for it to come back. I'm sorry, sir...but surely that can't be possible?! The municipal council won't accept it. I know that all this is a load of bullshit. You said there were two explanations... What was the second one? The second explanation. Listen carefully... It is possible... ...as a result of a landslide... ...the siphon was drained. It would then be the case that it will never restart. That's what you get from government officials! We asked you to come, because we didn't have any water. You've made your study, considered it, and racked your brains... ...and now you say... "You don't have water anymore." I can't tell you got something that you haven't got. It's very sad, what he says... but that's the way it is. Don't forget that I've brought you some valuable information. All YOU knew was that the water's no longer flowing. I've gilded the lily, perhaps. I can tell you that not only do you not have water... ...but you risk never having it again. No water, ever?!? That's just not possible. What can you do to help us? Sympathise with you, and forward my report to the Chief Engineer. - What will HE do? - He'll be sorry for you. The top guys DO have feelings. - But you're an engineer! - But I'm not a fountain. What's going to become of us? I can bring you water for drinking and cooking. What's the population? 162. At 20 litres per head per day... That's about 3,500 litres per day. That's possible. What about the animals? - That's right...there are animals. - 21 mules, 9 horses, 14 donkeys... 4 cows, 110 sheep and goats. And at least 60 pigs. - I've got 4. - Me, 2. And my son-in-law has 11. - I've got 3. - There's my 6 and Zachari's 4... ...that's 30 already. As each family has at least 1 pig... ...that makes 100 pigs. With the 8-ton truck which will come up each day... ...you'll get 20 litres per person and 50 per animal. Is that enough? Enough? What about our crops? What crops? I've got 3 hectares of tomatoes. Carnations...my carnations! And my 5,000 artichoke plants? And Cabridan, he has at least 30,000 strawberry plants. - And my peppers? - My peas? You have chosen well, haven't you!? Why not rice?! How can all that be watered? This year's harvest needs to be saved. At least MINE does! Why? Because it's a new crop. It's a demonstration. If I make a success, everybody will do it, and that can make the village rich. if I don't succeed... Then the carnations...the flowers... You can't let them die! Sir...they have to be saved! What with? With your trucks... can't you send more? Off the cuff, I'd estimate your crops would need 300 cubic meters a day... That's 30 10-ton trucks. The closest loading point is 41 km away. One truck costs 250 francs per km to run. Work it out. They go to the trouble of sending an engineer to tell US to work it out! That's government for you. No one is going to spend 20 million to save 5 or 6 million worth of crops. If an agricultural engineer had that sort of cash at his disposal... ...he'd rather build a new village in a more civilised part of the world. But in the meantime... what's to become of this one? As I see it... you have no choice but to move. Why change farm if there is more water in the country? Not only change farm... change country. I knew this would finish badly! You're all a bunch of idiots! He's just a liar... and I'm enjoying it all! Who on earth elected this senile twit to the council? His whole family. While he's here, he's not annoying THEM. Honest government! Yes it is honest... ...even if it annoys you. I shall do my best to organise water for you and your pigs... ...but I'm neither a wizard nor a water diviner. I can't water your vegetables on my own. Saying that, I shall take my leave. I need to go and organise your water tanker. This is a village of morons! Crackpot! - Excuse me, Father... - Hello, Cabridan. - I'd like to have a word with you. - Gladly. - YOU need ME for something? - Yes, I need you. - But mostly the Good Lord. - We always need Him, Cabridan. - We're nothing without Him. - I'm well aware. I've come to see if you can ask Him to start the water flowing again. - I've already been speaking to Him from the depths of my heart. Do you think it might work? The Good Lord is not there at our beck and call. But sincere prayer can get great things. The issue of water is so great that I'll devote my next sermon to it. I hope that He'll hear us. I'm not presuming that He'd change His plans for us... If He doesn't restore the water right away... If that's what He wants... well too bad for us. Maybe He could just send us a little rain?! Say...tomorrow during the sermon... as a nice surprise?! After a bit of rain, my strawberries would hang on for a week. I've got a whole field of autumn strawberries. They're a tricky crop, but they pay well. Stupidly, I haven't watered them for 5 days. I couldn't know what might happen. So...just a little rain tomorrow... Not too much to ask? Or He could increase the dew a lot. A good lot of dew is as good as a bit of rain. So you can talk to Him? Certainly... I'll bring it up this evening. But when you make YOUR prayer... ...you must be sincere. Well, I've noticed that he doesn't seem to take much notice of me. And then, there are things it's best one doesn't say oneself. It would be better coming from you. For example, you could let it slip... ...that I come to church every Sunday... ...with my wife and 2 kids... ...tell him that I always give 20 francs at mass. ...and my wife and the kids, 10 francs each. So if you add it all up, for Sunday... ...it comes to 50 francs a week. So, if we're ruined, it's going to cost Him 200 francs a month! If he says it's not a question of money, for Him... ...He should understand that He doesn't give that impression... ...if it's not repaid with kindness. Things are looking bad... Things are looking very bad! I'm head of the council because I'm mayor... ...and I'm mayor because I have the telephone. I have to pay every quarter... 1,352 francs, plus stamp. The money isn't for me. So tell me what it's for. - It's your water subscription. - So, where's the water? Be reasonable. It was explained to you that it was an accident... Maybe a landslide. I don't want my cow and pasture water taken from me... ...and my eggplants. I've paid for my water...I want my water. The tanker's here in 5 hours. You'll get your share. I was told to bring jugs. What can I do with so little? Will that be enough for my pasture? If someone had said to me... "We are thieves... "we're taking over the water supply and it will cost you plenty." Then I'd not have had my pasture, but now I have 5 cows on it. I've paid for the water... I want my water. You'll get 150 litres for your cows. The tanker will take it over to your place. What about my eggplants? They were coming along nicely but they're already looking thirsty. They're green now... and that's how they'll stay. And my pasture? It's green now but it'll soon be yellow! This just can't ever happen... It's here in writing... I've bought water from the spring... not from a water-tanker. The water in the tanker most likely comes from a spring. Not mine! We're all just as upset as you are! It's a case of absolute necessity takes precedence. I have absolute necessities... that need my water! Can't you take into account about the landslide? I don't take anything into account... especially that. I've paid for my water... I want my water. The spring isn't flowing... where do you want us to get it from?! Get it from wherever you like! And it's none of your business. You might be on the council... but I didn't vote for you. You just keep out of this... ...or you'll get your face bashed in! Where do you think you are?! In a house of water-thieves. I want my water! This is just the beginning... Next time... You're really getting on our nerves! Understand? - Are you talking to me? - Yes...to you! I'll whack him one! Next time I'll burn the place down! There you are fountain-keeper... There you are, water-thief! What the hell are you talking about?! I've done what I can, and I've given what I have. I'm warning you... I want my water by tonight... ...or you'll get a thrashing like I gave the mayor! You gave the mayor a thrashing?! You wouldn't know how! You can get one too! I've never seen so much effort for so little return! So...any signs? Got a jarful dribble out, full of tadpoles. The pipes into the ponds are blowing air. Take a break, eh... Come home and have something to eat. Thinking about my carnations give me a stomach ache. Pick up some wine from Philox?ne... I need a drink! Come on! - P?tugue! - What? Come and see what's in the tank. - A toad...a big one. - He's dead. So what does it matter...? It's no one we know! It smells bad, and I was going to use the water for soup. Definitely no. - Why not? - The tanker 'll be here tomorrow. Perhaps we need to get used to it. It might give it a flavour, but boiling should fix it, right? For sure...if it's well-boiled. The thing is not to tell anyone. You shouldn't have let me see it. I'm sorry, but I must get home. Are you going down to the bottom of Passe-Temps? Yes, I have to. I'll come back for mass... They say the priest is going to talk about the water. - That interests you? - More than anything. Mother of God... Mother of God... give me back my water! Mother of God...have pity on me! I may be a sinner, but the flowers are innocent! Mother of God...look after them! And I did go to confession. And I shall willingly atone for my sins. Unless I have the carnations, she won't want me! Mother of God!... Mother of God!... You don't want me to die like my father. Have pity! My children...I really am happy... ...really happy to see all of you here... ...All coming together in your dear little church. The whole parish is here. I even see a small group, who are very intelligent... ...TOO much so perhaps... ...who usually spend their time, when others are at mass... ...outside a caf?. I don't name the caf?, as there only IS one... ...and I don't name the people... ...as everyone knows who they are. The only reason they're not filled with doubt... ...is that their lack of empathy enables them to laugh at us. They've come here today... and they are welcome. I shall even show them how today's mass will be directed to their attention. I'm very happy to see so many of you... ...but on the other hand I'm deeply sorry, even furious... ...and I'm going to tell you why. When I was young, my father was a peasant, just like you... ...in a hamlet near Sisteron. We had a cousin named Adolphin... ...who lived in another village not far from ours. However, he never came to visit us. Not for birthdays, not for christenings... ...not even for funerals. But occasionally, about once a year... I'd hear my father say... "Here's 'Adolphin coming our way... He must need something." There'd be Adolphin coming up the path in his Sunday best. He'd give us his compliments and regards... He'd talk about the family till it brought tears to your eyes. Then, just as he was leaving, after giving us all a hug... he'd say... "By the way, Bernard, you wouldn't have a plough to spare, would you?" "I broke mine on an olive-tree stump." Or a bundle of stakes for his vine transplants... ...as my father made a renowned wine. Or his horse had colic... and he wanted to borrow a mule. My father never refused him anything... ...but I often heard him say... "Adolphin is not a nice person". What you're doing to God is what Adolphin did. He never sees you till you turn up all weepy-eyed... ...your hands clasped tightly, in faith and repentance. Listen, you Adolphinistas...! Don't think that the Good Lord is as naive as my father!... ..and that he is not aware of the depths your spite can sink to. The Good Lord knows very well... ...that very few of you came to offer him sincere repentance... ...or to pray for the repose of their dead... ...or to take one step towards their eternal salvation. He know you are here because the spring is not flowing. Some are worried about their gardens... ..others for their pasture... others for their pigs... ...others worried if they'll have water for their Pernod. These prayers which you presume He will listen to... ...are not worth a hill of beans! Those prayers for tomatoes... ...those hallelujahs for artichokes... ...and the hosannas for melons... These are all the prayers of an Adolphine... ...and have no more chance of getting up to heaven... ...than a plucked turkey. Now...about the spring... I have to speak to you seriously. Since yesterday, I've thought of nothing else... and I constantly ask myself the question. This water has been so pure, so abundant, and so consistent, up to now... ...Why has it dried up? And at the moment we needed it most! At the mayor's request, over the telephone... ...which once again has done wonders... ...the government has sent us a young engineer... ...who is undoubtably extremely knowledgeable. Our village council was convened, and thanks to my spies... I have a very good idea of what was said. This technical expert began by befogging everyone... ...with words a mile long. Then, using all his science... ...he said that perhaps the water might come back... ...or perhaps it might not come back. His advice was to load our furniture on a cart... ...and to find somewhere else to live. That was all. Leave the houses where you were born... ...leave the fields in which your fathers have invested so much courage... ...and so much patience. Leave this little church... ...where you first came in your godfather's arms... ...and where you will all return for your funeral service. All of you. There, on two trestles... before the altar...All of you! Because at the time of appearing before the Supreme Judge... ...you are more like Adolphin than ever. And our little cemetery... ...where you have more friends than you do in the village... ...where one day you will be sleeping in the arms of Our Lord... ...to the sound of the cicadas sucking their clear sap... ...out of the apricot trees bent across the wall...yes... ...They are all the things he suggests you leave... ...because his pathetic science is incapable of saving us. I don't believe this fount of knowledge... ...because I don't trust engineers. The dig a lot of holes... but they never plant anything. This one has spoken of clay layers... ...syphons that stop working, trucks that cost the earth...etc, etc. He spoke of material things... that's all he knows about! He knows of nothing else. But I wanted to see your misfortune from a much higher point of view. For it seems to me, that to explain it... ..and to have that water given back to us... ...it requires us to look much further than at visible things. For in this world created by The Almighty... ...everything makes sense and everything has a purpose. Not a cicada sings without God's permission. So we must understand that when when we try to find a reason... ...it's because God let it happen... and maybe willed it to happen. I have read, in a profane work, a Greek tragedy... ...the story of the city of Thebes, struck by a ravenous plague... ...because their king had committed a crime... ...and I put the question to you... Do we have a criminal amongst us? That's not impossible. The greatest crimes aren't always those one reads about in the newspapers. There are those that are hidden the laws of mankind... ...but God knows about everything. So I address myself to this unknown criminal, if he should exist... I want to say to him... Brother, there is no misdeed that cannot be forgiven... There is no crime that cannot be redeemed. Sincere repentance erases everything. Whatever your misdeed may be however great your crime... ...try to make good. Repent, and you will be saved... ...and our spring will flow again as before. Now I'd like to talk about things that I've come to realise. It would seem to me that a just god, a Christian god, this God of ours... ...would not want to punish many for the crime of just one person. Therefore, if we don't just have ONE serious criminal... ...we must be harbouring a number of them. I'm not talking about murderers... I mean serious sinners... ...who, either together or separately, have committed evil deeds. I ask you all to examine your consciences... ..not just while you're sitting on the edge of your bed... ...pulling your shoes on... But on your knees! It's the best way for reflection. You ask yourself... "Have I sinned?" "Where? When? How? Why?" You look closely, very closely... ...through clear spectacles... ...like a grandmother looking for lice on a toddler. And when you have finished this review... ...you'll address your repentance to God... ...by coming to confession. For those who may be ashamed to come forward... ...having a deep shame which paralyses their good intentions... ...they have only to walk past the sacristy... ...or through the garden, with a package under their arm... ...as if they had only come to deliver me a dozen eggs. By the way... ...if you do have some eggs, I'm out of them at the moment. Or come in carrying a tool... ..as if you were coming to fix something at my place. There's a blockage... Mariette broke a washer which I've still to fix. I'll take your confession with no solemnity at all. A good confession may well start with a class of white wine. All that matters, my brothers, is sincerity and repentance. Any faults must be faced head on! We must ask God for forgiveness... and He likes nothing better than to forgive. As I've been speaking, something's occurred to me ...and I may need to change to what I've said. Maybe there aren't any serious criminals amongst us... ...no people who have really done something bad. But are there many people who've done GOOD deeds? That may be the crux of the matter! My dear brothers... you are not brothers! I've see you work, laugh, enjoy yourselves... But I have never seen one of you digging for the pleasure... ...in the neglected vineyard of a widow or orphan. On the contrary, when I came here... ...I heard of that unfortunate story of Bastide Fendue... ...that I want to remind you of today. One day a real estate agent came to the village... ...of course, he was from the city, and he was worse than the engineers. He'd bought a ruin called Bastide Fendue... ...because there were holes in the walls... ...as big as your arm. It was a wonder it was still standing. He fixed the roof and filled the cracks with plaster... ...and nicely rendered over the top. A retiree from the city paid a high price for it... ...and called it Villa Monplaisir. At first, when I came here, I wasn't aware of it. Finally, I wondered why, when Monplaisir was mentioned... ...everyone laughed, especially the building workers. One day, the retiree, who had delusions of grandeur... ...decided he wanted to be able to take a bath. He bought an electric pump for the tank... ..pipes, a bathtub... ...and he wanted to install a water tank in the attic. The builders have gone there, laughing more than ever. The installed the 2,000 litre cement water tank. Then they told to the retiree that it had to dry... ...and advised him not to fill it before 4 the following afternoon. Next day I saw the whole village heading down the road... ...and were looking at the villa as though they were at the circus. The retiree had already got the pump going... He was sitting at the window, smoking his pipe... ...with a look as if he wondered what all these people were expecting of him. He never found out. Because just as I was arriving at 4.30... ...his villa collapsed on his head. We buried him next day. It seems the builders were largely to blame. One of them made the stupid remark... "He said to make a water tank so we made a water tank." "If we'd told him it might have brought the house down... "...he may not have believed us and got someone else to do the job." So there...for a pittance... ...they've caused the death of a good man. But they aren't the only ones. There are others. All those who knew and who said nothing. And who laughed at that retiree, as he smoked his last pipe. My friends... ...when I see you so indifferent to other people's misfortunes... ...I am tempted to write to the bishop and request a transfer. You people don't need a priest... you need a missionary. Because to earn God's love, it's not enough just to avoid doing evil. Virtue isn't about being silent... shutting your eyes...remaining still. Virtue is about positive action. It's about doing good. Opportunities may not arise very often. That's why, when an opportunity DOES arise... ...the right situation is put under your nose... ...this is The Good Lord offering it to you! The one who doesn't jump onto the running-board... ...and who stands back with his hands in his pockets... ...is the silly fool who misses the train. And I regret to have to tell you, that you all fit very much into that category. Perhaps it is this lack of fraternity, generosity and charity... ...that has cost you so dearly today. But we can't just leave it at that. We have to do something about it. So I'm proposing that tomorrow we have a procession. It will be a great opportunity to regain the friendship of our patron saint... ...the renowned St Dominic... ...who must be deeply offended by our conduct. Because on the day of the fountain festival... ...I felt that the council should have invited him. I only suggest that, because I'm not sure he attaches great importance ...to an oversight by a local council. Tomorrow we shall carry him solemnly out of his chapel... ...and we shall parade him through our misfortune... ...across our thirsty, dusty fields. I hope that the sight of those dying crops... ...a sight so wrenching to our hearts... will have the same effect on him... ..and that he will intercede in our favour, as he has always done... ...with The Lord. And I tell you, that given the magnitude of the disaster.. ...the priest at Accates says that he would come to our procession ...to help with his prayers... and his beautiful baritone voice. So we shall all go, under the banners of the parish... ...across our fields that are dying of thirst. When you are in the procession... ...you will only hear the distant bell... ...the song of the cicadas, and the tramp of your steps. Then humbly and sincerely... ...you will raise your souls to God, for it is not the banners ...which give power to the procession... It is all those pure souls. And there is still something even more precious than a pure soul... ...and that is a soul which has been MADE pure. If some among you... ...it would be too much to expect all of you... ...but if some of you... ...took the resolution to redeem their sins... ...if they took that solemn engagement upon themselves... ...to perform at least one good dead... ...or to make good an evil deed they have committed... I am sure that the Great Fountain-Keeper in heaven, who cut off your water... ...awaits only your repentance to restore it. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost... so may it be. The tanker has arrived. What did you think of it? - Of what? - The sermon. The priest speaks well, but it won't change anything. Are you telling me the water won't come back? I mean that to confess... to regret the harm you've done... ...that may fix your relations with God... ...but it does nothing for those whom you have harmed. It's still strange. What is? You said that the village could be hit by a disaster. The disaster's happened. You know I'm a bit of a witch! I'll end up believing it. Are you still determined to leave here? Yes...especially if there's no more water. The little spring stopped at the same time as the others. But I had a small supply. We were without it so long, we learned how to cope. We'll have some more in 2 days. Baptistine's brother will be coming with 2 mule-loads. That will give us enough to manage with. Before you leave... ...you really must come and see me at my place. To do what? Firstly...my mother wants to meet you. That's hardly worth the trouble. And then...I really want to have a serious talk with you. Having saved you from the police, you can't refuse me that. If that'll make you happy, I'll come... When? This afternoon...around 4. Fine. - Isn't the water back? - Don't be silly! - It won't be back anytime soon. -Some folk are talking about leaving. Speaking of which... Clarissa's son left this morning. He hopes to find a job in town. He's been waiting for an excuse for a long time. A lot of people would like to leave country life. So here's an excuse..that's fine. Constantine and Jeannette say that if there's no water... ...there's no future. They don't want to eat chickpeas for the rest of their lives. What's wrong with chickpeas? - I love them...I'm crazy about them. - You're crazy about them on Fridays... ...with slices of fresh onion... But what if there's no onions, and you get them every day?! That's what's staring us in the face. All the young ones 'll leave... ...it'll be just old folk left. - Old folk are interesting. - You think so? They don't eat meat because of their teeth, and because they're too mean. So what do old people buy? A lot of old people are loaded. And when they're gone? I'll start with a factory in Aubagne. A good worker can always get a job. I don't want to move to town. I don't want to leave here. Don't cry, Fatso! Can't you men kill that Ugolin? - You've thought it, too?! - Pamphile! The schoolteacher wants to see us, at his place. He had me take 5 bottles to his garden. He'd like you to find Ugolin. OK. He wants you, too. Why? It's to hold a "council of war". That's what he called it. Off you go...I do trust that teacher. I'm sure he can make that girl do what he wants. It may be amusing for him... but us... ...what do WE get out of it? What did you mean by that? It seems to me, that if she wants to... she can make the water come back. Take a seat, gentlemen. I think we're all here. I'll tell you why I've asked you to come here. It's so we can discuss, together, the dire situation that you find yourselves in. Each and every one of you. A situation that threatens to result... ...sooner or later.. ...in the village being totally abandoned. But maybe the...procession... Do you believe in the procession? I'd rather a procession of water-tankers. But I must admit that this morning's sermon... ...had a profound impression on me. So you do believe in God, after all! I can't say that I believe, in the sense that you mean it. I don't go along with an old guy with a white beard... ...who sits on the edge of a cloud and watches what we do. No, I do NOT believe in that. Well, I DO believe that... and I'm sure about it. I'm sure about it too... So is the butcher...aren't you? No, Cabridan. I can't say I truly believe. But i won't say it too loudly in case it provokes Him. - Who? - The Good Lord. - But you don't believe! - It doesn't hurt to play it safe. And it certainly doesn't hurt to believe... ...that an evil deed is always punished. But that's not on earth... it's in heaven. I wouldn't claim to know what goes on in heaven. I simply maintain, that down here, when you do evil... ...sooner or later, you will be punished. And often in the most unexpected way. And sometimes the most mysterious. On that point, we all agree. - That's true. - End of discussion. That stuff the priest said... ...about the water being stopped because of an unknown criminal... ...and the good things that could start it again... Did you believe that? That really bowled me over. Say...didn't you notice how hard he was staring at US? He was singling us out. You're wrong about that. At one point he was staring at Ugolin. He seemed to be addressing HIM! Yes...you! He was staring at you... ...when he was on about that king and the plague... ...which struck everyone, because of him. What are you getting at?... That I brought the plague?! My carnations are suffering this plague! The priest knows that... That's why he was looking at me. A good deed that everyone could have performed... ...but which nobody did. Does that mean anything to anyone? That's not all. I seemed that it all boiled down to that. I've thought of nothing else since. Nobody's thinking about that any more. It's just your imagination. It's all dead and buried. My dear Papet, an evil deed is never buried. It's like couch grass that grows faster, the deeper you bury it. With couch, there's only one solution... ...dig it up and expose the roots to full sunlight. Yes...that works... It works for THAT... It was the burial of the hunchback... My wife's been telling me that... for a long time. We were still at the cemetery... P?tugue threw the stone into the hole. Next to it was his young son's grave. And then that crazy woman... who used to open her eyes like this... ...and the little girl dressed in black... her face as white as marble. Amelie started crying... and she wanted to stay longer. After she'd calmed down on the way home, she said... "If ever the Good Lord learns about this, He will punish us." The Good Lord doesn't need to learn anything... He sees all...and he knows all. For the time being, He did nothing... ...but then he prepares a terrible drought... ...and boom!... you're in it up to your ears! Is this collective crime so horrible... ...it's impossible to confess? What have you done? It's just that we did nothing. - He's the one who did it. - Me?...Did what? You know very well. It's you who committed the evil deed. You can't accuse someone without proof! It's not enough to gossip... with a wink and a nod. If people are doing that... I'll complain to the law. Because it's not true! And I'm not afraid of anyone! My conscience is clear! Some people water down the milk they sell. Others make coffins with cheap pine bottoms. Others sell bread that's not cooked so it weighs more. And I say nothing about it! But if I need to talk, I SHALL talk!...Because I... Here's somebody... ...who could perhaps best tell us.. ...how to "expose our couch grass roots to the sun". - She knows nothing. - She wasn't even born. Her father could have told her. Told her what? Her father didn't know anything either. Everything will come out here... but only if she leaves... There's no need for us to hurt her unnecessarily. I think it'd be better if she stayed. We don't need to bring up stupid things. The teacher was right to bring her here. What has happened can't be undone. It's better to sort things out than to fight about it. You know what I told you, the other day... and what you promised me? We agreed not to say anything... but now's the time to speak! - So what do you think? - I have a gift for you. - For me? - Yes...for you. That's nice..is it a letter? No, it's a drawing. I was going to keep it...but it really belongs over your bed... ...beside The Good Lord. What's it supposed to signify? - Gracious! - It's well done! - It's a joke! - Who drew this? My father. Did you see? She gave me a present... ...a drawing of her father... that gives me great pleasure. It proves our friendship. So now I feel more than ever, that it's time to speak... ...and tell them what I said to you out in the hills the other day. So tell them! What did he say to you out there? It's of no interest. I've far more important things to say to you here. Please sit down, gentlemen. Everybody knows at least something of the evil deed you were involved in. Just what was it? No...we haven't done anything wrong! All we did was keep our noses out of other people's business. I'm leaving! - Something to fear? - I've nothing to fear... ...but all this bullshit is starting to piss me off! No, Papet, you have to stay. Accept your responsibility like the rest of us. My responsibility for what? What am I supposed to have done? Nothing! You're just a bully and a savage, like the rest of them. But HE is the real criminal. That one there! Are you referring to me? People have told you lies! Have you forgotten about the Passe-Temps melons? What if I'd put in a complaint to the police? What are you at? Who do you think you are? If that's why we're here... ...to let you off the hook... Let's leave now. What have I got to fear? I've nothing to fear! You think I don't know anything! - I've been told the truth about it! - Who by? - Baptistine. - That bitch?! Just like her to stick her nose into it! Stick her nose into what? All of you know about farm, "Rosemary"... before I was born. Are you all struck dumb?! Of course we all know about it. It belonged to your grandmother Loretta's brother. He was quite a rascal... the king of the poachers. You're the spitting image of HER. Thank you! At his death, he left the farm to his sister... my grandmother. She never went there. And then Ugolin wanted to buy it. Exactly! I wanted to buy it. I had a little money... ...and I wanted to buy it, because i liked it. How have I done wrong with that? I went to Peypin...so what? I'd been to see Florette. She was a widow... I offered 5,000 francs....she said no. I stayed around Peypin for a week. I slept in the hills under the ash trees near the Arroumi mine. I went to see her every day. I brought her thrushes, sugared almonds... ...and those fancy Roquevaire donuts. Nothing worked. She'd left the farm to rack and ruin... ...but she was as stubborn as a mule. By the 5th day, she wouldn't answer the door. As I was leaving...walking under her window... ...she emptied her shit-bucket on my head! When I came back, all cleaned up... ...with a jar of jam this big... ...I wasn't 20 metres from the house, when she started shooting at me! A real shot with a gun? They're like that in Peypin. It was buckshot... ...I pulled a dozen pellets out of my backside. I've got them out with a toothpick. With a toothpick and a mirror. I went back... I offered her 10,000 francs! I held up 100-franc notes... fifty in each hand. Remember that at the time, that was worth something. She'd warned her neighbours, and there were 10 of them with dogs. They've dumped me, bashed and bitten, into the manure pit. I was the colour of a Chinaman. - What about your money? - They didn't touch it. They were savages, but not thieves. On the 8th day... I imagine she fired at you with a cannon! I realised I'd have to wait... and I came back here. He came back to the village... ...and then he went up to "Rosemary". Who told you that? With him, he had cement and a trowel. Did he want to start repairing the farm? He wanted to block off the spring... And he blocked it! The spring was already there, at that time? That farm depended upon it. At the top of the field, in front of the house... ...at the foot of a small strip of blue stone. At the time of Pique-Bouffigue? It was flowing at the time of his death. I brought his coffin up. I was 20. I've drunk that water. It was light...slightly blue. It was no big stream... about as wide as my wrist. It flowed quickly and and left big white strands... They were the rosemary roots. - You saw it? - Many times. I've drunk from it when I was out looking for partridges. You blocked that spring? Why? Whatever for? That's just it! Why would I want to block it?! You believed that when Florette died... ...the farm would be auctioned. Without water, it would be worthless. That's just a story you spread in your caf?. Except that when grandma died... ...she left the farm to my father, who had just married. They didn't want to se anyone... ...and instead of selling "Rosemary", they went to live there. It was a dumb idea. He had a good job in town... why didn't he stay there? He needed to be a peasant, to work a farm! Was your father never able to find the spring? We never knew it existed. Nobody ever told you? Nobody. Nobody...ever! None of you ever said anything? I didn't know...I never knew. It was none of our business. No... It was OUR business. At daybreak, every day of our lives... ...we had to walk 2 km from "Rosemary" ...up to Passe-Temps... every day of our lives. With pitchers on our heads and in our hands... ...and stones under our bare feet. And nobody said anything? It wasn't any of their business! My father was a prisoner to water, his whole life. One year, we had corn... The entire field... from one end to the other. My father had dug for weeks... my brother carried the stones away. I kissed him... and wiped his forehead. In the evening, he would fall asleep at the table... ..and we'd help mother get him into bed. The corn was successful. But the rain never came. Then we had to make the journey for water... ...twice during the day, and twice at night...under the stars. That didn't achieve anything... it needed 100 litres a plant. He had more than 10,000. It didn't make sense. My father wasn't a sensible man. So despite all our efforts... ...the corn started to fade. Under the midday sun... ...it crackled like a distant fire... and then... ....the leaves started to fold up lengthways... and then... ...the flowers wilted. And one afternoon as I woke up under the olive tree... ...I saw my father in the middle of the cornstalks. He was touching them and looking up at the sky. And then he lowered his head... And then he was lying on the ground. He was holding his head in his hands. He was trembling like a bird in a trap. He was weeping over the death of his corn. And up on St Esprit ridge, there was a peasant... ...leaning on his pick... watching us. He probably knew that there was water under our feet. Yes...he knew... That was me. You?! Yes...I saw him lying down... I saw his hump moving. Mother of God! I only had to walk down... ...and with a few wacks with my pick... ...the water could have been shooting to heaven. What a great day that would have been! Why didn't you say a word?! I wasn't alone... HE was with me. He was cutting fennel... a bit higher up. - I was embarrassed. - I've didn't stop you going down. Why didn't you go down yourself. I don't get involved in other people's business. What sort of rotten heart must someone have... ...who refuses God's offer of performing a miracle? What a great day for me, that could have been! And what a great day for US, if you'd done it! We would have been able to eat TWICE a day! And yet...that's not the worst of it. One night... ...my brother got up to get a drink of water. He was 15. As the pitcher was empty... ...he took some water out of the tank. He died of fever. My father died of grief. And my mother went crazy. This is what YOU did to me! When your brother was sick, it was ME who lent money for treatment. You knew he'd never be able to pay you back! You made him sign papers which gave you rights over "Rosemary". sur les "Rosemary". He knew what he was signing... I didn't abuse or threaten him. He said how much he appreciated it. In the evening, by the fire, he played music for me... ...playing the harmonica... and YOU were playing with him! all very moving... but you still blocked the spring. Prove it! He's right... You don't have any proof. He himself is the proof! He waited no time at all before he evicted us from the farm... 2 days later, the spring was flowing. I heard in the village that perhaps... ...then I searched with the divining rod... and then... Don't give us that bullshit! You blocked the spring. Everybody sitting here KNOWS you did. That doesn't mean it's true! Who saw me do it? Me. I saw you do it. That's not possible! You stole the cement from my father. We had half a bag of it next to the pig-pen. One morning, before leaving for school... I'd hope to get a sparrowhawk that was coming after our chicks... ...that were inside the henhouse. I was hidden behind an olive tree. You came past...looking as if you were going hunting. You came up to the cement bag... ...and you took 4 handfuls which you put in your gamebag. I saw you! If I took any cement, it was your father's... nothing to do with you! It was going to my thrush hide... I was walking along...I saw your cement. For some time... I'd wanted to plug a hole that caused a draught... I followed you! What right did you have to follow me?! Did you see yourself as a policeman, when you were a squirt?! I followed you... and I saw you. You took a flat stone... and forced it into the hole. You threw in a handful of cement and gravel. It's not true! Then some soil and then the rest of the cement. - Then with a stick... - Tell them what I told you! That would fix everything... You see they're against me! This is the most sordid story I have ever heard. It may very well interest the police... ...as it falls within the scope of the law. Nobody could have seem me! If the spring had existed before, it disappeared of its own accord. Things like that happen. Papet had told me that the spring was a family secret. You must be thick!... Why do you want to fight me? I want everything to go back to you... The farm, the flowers, the spring. What's it got to do with those tribunal arseholes?! Those tribunal arseholes... ...may well put you before some real judges. - I'd like to see them try! - Stop being an idiot. Why aren't you trying to fix this? That's what I'm asking for! Manon, listen to me, please!... Just suppose this WERE true... It's not true!... I'm just making a supposition... Just imagine I might have committed a terrible crime... ...that caused me a great deal of worry and I was talking to myself about it... ...and it kept me awake nights. Imagine, that even in the full light of day... ...I might hear that harmonica... ...playing a little tune that is loaded with reproach. Then it happens that I see you... that I love you, I want you. You cannot ever know what a terrible combination that makes! All the regret of the evil I've done you... ...mixed with the pleasure of the good things that I want to do for you. And when we have children... ...if, by chance, one should be like your father... ...that one would become my favorite...my baby. I shall get on my knees before his cradle and beg forgiveness! How could you say such horrible things?! Why did you ask me to cut off my moustache? I'd rather it 'd been your head! He just confessed. In front of witnesses. It's not true! I told you that it was just a supposition! Haven't you ever made suppositions? Of course we have. A supposition that we hand you over to the police... ...and they force you to give back the farm. - One...one supposition. - You shut up...we've no time for you! Ugolin, when you accuse someone of something serious... ...he has the right to swear. You want to take the oath? Absolutely! Swear on the Gospel that you're innocent... Everyone will believe it. On the Gospel, no! That's not allowed. I swear... Nothing at all! You should all mind your own business and stay out of mine! That's the way thieves talk to the police. What right does this teacher have to question me... ...the one who's been meeting her out in the hills. I want to marry her and give her my fortune. And, God knows... He wants her for himself! If she didn't have a nice pair of tits, he wouldn't bother! And you carry on because I didn't pay for some cement! Well, I'll give you back a whole bag... That should more than satisfy you. When there is only one witness, it's worth nothing! You're giving me the shits, wasting my time like this! The hunchback is dead! He has no cares anymore.. I have plenty! He sees his corn die... Everybody's weeping! I'll watch my carnations die, and no one will give a damn! I haven't got time to waste... ...listening to jealous lovers and false witnesses. It would be great if it rained just a little bit... ...then the carnations would take longer to die. Do you know for a fact that the water won't come back? Me? I don't know anything. If it DID depend on me, I wouldn't lift a finger! I don't get involved in other people's business! I'm leaving, the day after tomorrow. Will you join the procession to ask God's mercy? Don't you fear that if God sees me there... ...it might remind Him of your actions? I won't be joining the procession. I have to get ready for my move. I can lend you my mule. Keep it for yourself.. You're going to need it. You'll soon need to be loading up your furniture... ...and moving somewhere else. You sound as if you're enjoying that thought. Why I would be sad? I do want to thank you for your concern about me. There's nothing more you can do... It's too late. I'll thank you and be on my way. I'm going to Aubagne... At least there's water there. You'll never come back to the village? Maybe one day...if I'm rich. I'll come back for my relics. And I'll take a little walk around the village... ...if I can make it through the undergrowth! There'll be nothing more than the corners of houses... ...and wild figs will be growing through the broken windows of the walls of the church. On a rotting bench near the fountain... ...will sit some old people, with Papet in the centre. They don't see me. They say nothing. They are staring at the empty pipe... waiting for the water to return. It will never return! One thing's for sure... That farm was stolen by Ugolin. He bought it at auction for 12,000 francs... and without water, it wasn't worth it. But he got her out. Maybe... but she wasn't there. I told you what I saw. I'm happy to sign a statement. At some time, people have gone to prison for signing something. There are people who refused to sign something some time... ...who've gone to hell! Prison's closer. That depends on how old you are. What's the point of getting them to sign it? This paper proves that Ugolin, by means of a criminal manoeuvre... ...depreciated the property to buy it cheaply. - I'm sure that the tribunal... - The tribunal?! The tribunal will utilise an expert. If it doesn't agree to give back a property that's been fraudulently obtained... ...it will award an appropriate sum for damages and interest. So there! Oh!...there you are, Papet! I was waiting for you. Which way did you come? When your legs are getting past it, you learn all the shortcuts. Let me say... What you intend doing, shouldn't be done this way. I know Ugolin... This could finish up with gunfire. It could begin with a few wacks with a stick! But no pat on the back. More like what you do to tenderise stockfish... on your front step... about half an hour. Afterwards, we bring him round with ammonia...I brought some. Just because he bought a farm... the lot of you are going to kill him? Certainly not! That's not the intention. But if he's honest he should give it back. Not like that. What I can do is to talk to him alone. He's my nephew... and he's afraid of me. I'll say if people know about this, it'll be bad for the family. And that he should make amends by giving them 20,000 francs. Those women are leaving here. We'll say he's given them 20,000 francs ...and everyone will congratulate him. Not me. My congratulations would start at 100,000. That's still pretty miserable for congratulations. But where would he get it? He's put everything into his carnations. What about his inheritance? - You've got 100,000. - Lend it to him. If the water comes back, I'd give 250K for it. If he was sued, it could cost him a lot more. Now listen...you all stay here. Don't make a sound, and wait for me. Sit on the ground... It's best he doesn't see you. We're not looking for a fight. If he comes up with the 100K, I'll hold off with the beating. It'll be enough for me to punch him in the face, next time I see him. Pamphile, you go too far. I'm sure you're not a Christian. Papet's an old miser... If you searched in his mattress... I wouldn't dare! Chickadee! Chickadee! What's he mean by "Chickadee"? It's what Ugolin's mother called him when he was a tot. He was cute as a kid. Schoolteacher!... Come quickly. Come here! Isn't he there? There's a letter for you on the kitchen table. For me? A letter? That should be interesting. What's it say? What's with these candles? They're for the Blessed Virgin... to bring back the water. Schoolteacher... I am writing to you because you know better than me... ...it is necessary that I make amends. Because I did block the spring and now it won't flow for me. That is a tragedy. The water will never return for me. She would like the farm, but she doesn't want me. So I'm giving her the farm. That is my testament. The money in the coffee tray... ...on the sideboard, is to say masses. I confessed last year. Since then I have done nothing wrong. This is my last will and testament. I give my farm to Manon, the daughter of the hunchback. I have wronged them. It cannot continue. I saw the hunchback. He is not happy, but he is in good shape. Now he'll be happy. I'm leaving the farm to Manon. If the water comes back, the carnations will be beautiful. Goodbye, my regards to everyone. This is my testament. I have put a stamp on this paper to make it official. Signed Ugolin des Soubeyran. With my blessing and salutations full of grace. It will happen at the olive tree at the corner. Nothing much is planted there. "The olive tree at the corner". I know where he means. What on earth's he done? Maybe it's just a joke. We might have got here in time. Just like his father! Just like his father. I don't mind staying with him. You others go and let them know in the village. Claudius, tell Sidonie to bring a clean sheet. We should say he fell from the olive tree when he was pruning it. That's better for the family. You're right...better not to tell them. Mainly because of the priest... He wouldn't come otherwise. But I'll have to tell the truth in confession. That can wait... You can go after he's buried. I'll go and tell my wife... and return for the evening. I'll come back too. Me too. Thanks, on his behalf. I was forgetting the main thing! Tell me...is this document valid? It's written, and signed by the testator. The style is rather rambling! Yes...But the will of the testator is firmly expressed there. Wait for me! We almost forgot this. It's a beauty...look at it! It's big enough to handle anyone. Lucky I grabbed it. If you agree, we'll go together... ...to take this to our shepherdess. We'll go together tomorrow morning. Tomorrow morning? More than happy to, my friend. I'll have as much pleasure seeing her joy, as I'll have seeing yours. I'm delighted, because this sheet of paper could mean the return of the water! - It's a very precious sheet! - Feet hair! Poor 'Chickadee'! It wasn't so hard to do what you did. Neither the words of the schoolteacher or the priest... ...are worth that. It's true that there's this girl... She's the one you lost your mind over. You didn't want to marry the lame one... You were wrong. You've gone and done this at the prime of your life. But then the Soubeyrans... ...have never been too sensible. It's been the women who destroyed them... ...like with your father. Now, I can tell you. It was on account of a whore from Lascours... ...that he strung himself up amongst the prickly pear of Vieilles-Bergeries. That's the Soubeyrans for you... All hanging up like sausages! But all said and done... you could have left the farm to me! Though I guess it's not the time to reproach you. Besides that, there is more than one place in the vault... ...and you'll take one with me. I'd prefer that, anyway. Sad as it is, I'd prefer it. Now, listen to me, all of you... Ugolin has given the farm back... so he's paid his debt. Although to...to hang himself... That's not...not Catholic. His father and his great-uncle did the same thing...and for nothing. God will have to accept it's a family of hangers! But he didn't do it on a whim... He had a reason. It seems to me he's paid this way, because it was in his nature to hang himself. But we have to pay as well. Why do YOU want to pay, J?r?mie? Because we didn't commit the crime... ...but we allowed it to happen before our eyes. Now that he's returned the farm to them... ...I don't think they'll be leaving. They're going to need to establish themselves. Perhaps we could take the two woman a few things... ...sone new potatoes, some zucchinis. One or two...chickens. A few dozen hatching eggs. I still have a crate of vine peaches. We'll go in the morning. What if people know about it? They'll make fun of us. We look like the Three Wise Men. So you'll be the black one?! What an arsehole! Eliacin!...where are you off to? Up there...what about you? Us too. They'll need a mule to carry all their stuff. As I had to go over to Aubagne anyway... ...to get fertilizer... I thought I'd make a detour... ...if I might be of help... carry some boxes. - Is this your wine? - It's last year's. You selling it in Aubagne? No, I'm not selling it. How are you going to carry it back? Yes...if you have to carry the fertilizer back. I shan't be bringing it back. I don't have to explain to YOU, everything I do. Is that it up there? Pretty warm, eh? Where do you go to get down? Follow the path and turn left. There's the mayor, too. And the schoolteacher. Everyone's got the same idea. Show's it wasn't a bad one. So...schoolteacher... what happens next? We don't want to frighten the women. I'll go ahead with the mayor and Mr Belloiseau. The butcher, too... And you too, Anglade. Just be careful you don't get shot at! There are several here who deserve it. It's the schoolteacher. I thought all these people might be coming to burn the witch. If it was to be such a lovely occasion... ...we'd have offered you ladies front-row seats. - There's only us men. - The middle-aged sort. We've brought you some good news. Something to make you happy. The truth is, it's your birthday... ...and we wanted to wish it to you at your place. Come in then, gentlemen. This is where you live? This is where we've existed... ...for two years. Nice eh? Neat and tidy, isn't it? Is your mother here? No, she's down in the gully. She felt she had to hide, when she saw you coming. - We wouldn't have harmed her. - She wasn't to know that. Are you all ready to move? Yes...pretty much so. We're out of water... so we'll be leaving this afternoon. - Don't be so sure of that. - Why? Wouldn't you rather be returning to your farm...to "Rosemary"? Me? To Ugolin's place? No...your place. With the whole village's blessing?! That's why you brought gifts... for the wedding! And YOU!... You're in with them?! You're very far from the truth. Listen to the village church bell... The wind is turning... ...listen carefully. Who has died? Ugolin! Yes, Ugolin died last night. He was climbing an olive tree...and bang!... The branch broke. He fell on his back. He hit the ground and breathed his last. - Maybe he'd eaten too much. - Anyway... ...when we found him under the tree... ...he was dead. What would he have been doing in that tree? We really don't know. He wouldn't know any more. It was God who led him up to the highest branches. By God's justice... ...one of my father's olive trees killed his assassin. Don't speak ill of him... you don't know all of it... In his will he's left you your heritage. It leaves "Rosemary" farm to YOU. Who told you that? His last letter, which I've brought you. Is this a trap? No! There is no doubt that document is authentic. It grants you ownership of the farm... and all that's in it. It's may be possible to save the carnations... ...the plants are still green. But the water will need to come back quickly. I'll advance you 100,000 francs for half your harvest. Yesterday, Mr P?toffi mentioned a figure of 150! If she wants...but the water still has to come back... Do you understand? What am I supposed to do about it? You can do a lot about it. How's that? By coming on the procession this afternoon. You're the one that's been wronged. The Good Lord will be far more receptive to your prayers than ours. If it's YOU asking Him... I'm sure He'll make the water flow again. However, you all know that my family... ...have never had any luck with springs. God listens better, when the request is on behalf of others. Even more, when it's for people who've done you wrong. It would be in your interests... If the water returns, Anglade here... ...would pay you 150,000. You could rent a house in the village. This cave is nice... But a house would be better. It could be set up quickly... Everyone wants to make you happy... to help you. HE's the one you should have helped. But for him... ...you're too late. What you told us yesterday turned us all inside out. You didn't know about it? They knew for a long time... but didn't fully appreciate... When you're doubled over a pick all day... ...digging to feed your children... ...there's not much time to think about things... ...even if you could. It'd be said that the hunchback had no water... ...that it was Ugolin's fault. You didn't dare denounce him. And the water was not far away... the hunchback had only to look for it. "If he's a proper peasant.. he'll find it." We never realised how much he suffered. Now you've told us... Now we know. It was a real kick in the guts. But then, our regrets don't do anything for you. So...in the name of the village... ...I need to speak to the hunchback. Hunchback, we did you great wrong... His mother's name was Florette. You can call him Jean de Florette. I didn't mean bad by it. My father had a short leg... He was called The Gimp. - It's not to annoy... - Just what we're used to What we're used to... But she's right. He's not "the hunchback" any more. Jean de Florette, when you trekked through the hills... ...with your pitchers... they must have been very heavy. What you were carrying was our sin. But today I know where you are. You have won your heaven on earth. So...up there... put in a word for us here. Don't make our children pay for the sins we have done you. Jean de Florette, this is Old Anglade... from Sinc?rina?re farm... who has come to beg your forgiveness. Maybe there were good deeds done for him ages ago... that he never told you about. Whoever did him a good deed? Name me one! Me, for example. This is not to brag... ...but your father bought a cutlet from me every week... ...and francs worth of meat for the dogs. I gave him a good packageful. It's true you were generous with the dogs' meat. What breed of dogs were they. They were a very strange breed. They walked on their hind legs. There was one with black hair... ...and brown eyes, and another who had big blue eyes and blond hair. Your father never had any 4-legged dogs! How long have you known that? I've always known it. Do you think that scraps for the dog... ...would include a kilo of bone marrow? He didn't realise you knew? I worked it so he didn't get it. When people are proud and a bit crazy, they believe what they want to believe. At Christmas and Easter... when I wanted to slip him a bit of lamb leg... ...I had to mess it up a bit. So I'd cut it into strips and twist it around. There was a real trick to it! It looked a mess. I had to laugh to myself! - One day it was his birthday... - He never had a birthday. I knew his name was Jean. I'd seen it on the register at the town hall. I remembered it because my sister's Jeannette. I said to him... "Would you like some lung for your cat?" If he said yes... ...I'd give him half a calf's liver that I'd dressed. I'd powder it with a bit of sawdust, so it didn't look too good. It really fooled him! But he was timid... ...he didn't know how to take advantage. He replied... "No...we don't have a cat." So I ate it myself and toasted "Saint Jean". I don't say I deserve any awards... ...but I did it in good faith. And now... ...if you'd like that I have to close my butcher's shop... ..and leave the house where I was born... ..and that my village dies... ...it proves that you're not a real puppy after all. I know that whenever I've fed puppies... ...they've licked my hands. I not asking much. But in memory of the bone marrow... ..and the metre of cutlets... ...I'm asking you to join the procession. I know you'll be there. There we are. I'm sure she'll come! In that case, we're saved! What are the rest of us going to do now. If you'll agree with me... when we take the gifts... ...it would be nicer if we don't hang around. I was thinking the same thing. If she wants to thank us, she knows where to find us. It's enough that she's seen us. Gentlemen... I feel that our mission is accomplished... ...and we should now make an orderly withdrawal. I feel any further communication with the young lady... ...should be taken care of by the schoolteacher. Now it's the schoolteacher's part! Heart hair! Has my father been wrong? Yes, I have to say... he made some mistakes. The victims are always partly at fault. He was wrong to have put himself into an environment where he didn't belong. He was as much a real peasant as they were! They didn't call him Jean de Florette... ...because he'd never said that he was Florette's son. If he'd sent his children to school in the village... ...I've no doubt your school friends ...would have revealed the location of the spring to you. He should've come to play bowls in the village... He'd have been on first-name terms with them. If you only knew how much he would've wanted that. You believe that? Of course, he never said anything... ...and I didn't want to talk about it in front of the others... ...but whenever he heard footsteps on the path... ...or the bell ringing on a mule... ...he'd take a bottle and 2 glasses out to the shade of the pergola. Then he'd go and start digging in the middle of the field, in plain view... ...and wait there for a call, a friendly word, a greeting. But they'd just go on up without saying a word. They'd become smaller and smaller as they moved away... ...and the bottle would sit there on the table... ...still full of our friendship. One day a hunting dog turned up at the farm. It had lost its master, and it was panting with thirst. So we gave it some of our water... that we'd hauled over the hills. Then my father tied it with a piece of string... ..and we fed it better than we fed ourselves. And we waited for the hunter... ...that stranger who'd have to talk to us... ..and at least thank us. That night there was a repeated knocking on the door. My father got up to open it. It was the branch of a fig tree. Next day, the hunter did turn up. We saw him coming up the path. He looked towards us... ...and he whistled. The dog broke free of its string... and ran off. So, when they come being all friendly now... ...I hold it against them even more, for not coming back then... ...when those glasses were waiting on the table. They were like that because of Ugolin. They thought he was a friend of your father's... and he'd told them... "Don't get to close to him, or he'll shoot at you." That's awful. The Good Lord certainly took His time, before he had him fall out of that tree. If what the priest says is true... ...it was The Devil who got him to climb that tree. He hung himself. He did!? Why? Heredity...remorse...and love. One of those dark and violent souls, driven by extremes. He gave up his life to gain your forgiveness. So much patience and so much hypocrisy... ...and that's where it led him. He did one good thing... and it's a crime in the eyes of God. He inflicted the ultimate punishment on himself. And the others are full of remorse. If Jean de Florette was with us here... ...wouldn't he be fetching his bottle? If only we could persuade the water to start this morning... ...the fountain would be flowing this afternoon. Make sure you're in the front rank. So what is it? This procession should not take place! Why? Because I'm ashamed. The water will return to the fountain in one hour. Perhaps before... the water WILL come back. It will come back if it's God's will. Father...I'm the one who's blocked the spring. I suspected it. - I have to tell you why. - I know that already. I learned everything when I arrived here. But I couldn't talk about it. To get revenge...you cut off the water. I don't want to know how... that's of no importance. You tell me it's going to return? So much the better. Let's go to the procession. But the peasants are going to think it's a real miracle. It will be a real miracle. But it'll be ME who's getting it back! Miracles aren't always what you think. There ARE holy sites where The Lord has performed spectacular miracles in front of crowds. To confirm their faith, there are people who need... ...that God removes some large tumor. ...or brings a seemingly dying person back to life... You could say that God rings his loudest bell for the deaf. But the true miracle is invisible... and every day. Who allowed you to find this spring... ...that so many men had sought for centuries? That's the miracle...it's plain to see! The Lord has given you a weapon of vengeance... ...a secret and dramatic vengeance, that has shaken these peasant souls... ...striking them through their greatest loves... ...their soil...and their village. They suffered... and they're the better for it. But you were in great danger. You were going to leave, having accomplished your revenge... ...leaving ruins and desert behind. The Devil must have thought he had you held in his claws. But by a singular grace, one that you probably deserved... ...God has ruled out your transgression... ...and the glory and peace of forgiveness have been inspired in you. The real miracle is in the souls that God has worked on. A miracle! Thank you, oh Lord... thank you great St Dominique! Jonas, your pool is overflowing! You animals! You savages! You're bad Christians! Pardon, St Dominique... I apologise for them. They don't deserve your bounty. Schoolteacher... It does me the honour... ...of signing this contract at your place, and with your fountain pen. Thank you. You sign there. That's 200,000... I've counted it. Of course, if the carnations make over 400,000... ...I'll give you your extra share. But there is one thing which I would like very much... This is to be a secret. Why? Because it's our business, and no one else's. Nobody else knows I have this money... ...including my son and my wife. I always say I've got nothing... It saves me from boasting! I'll say that you gave me the crop... ...and that we have a business arrangement. They'll all take it as they see fit. Are you working tonight? Every minute sees another plant dying. I don't need much light to clear the channels. I've got 2 lanterns. And besides, it's Ugolin's second vigil evening. The window will be lit... it'll save me a candle. Goodbye...and mum's the word! It's a promise. And thank you! You're the one who should be thanked... ...It was your prayers that got the water flowing. God be with you...both of you. So these valuable notes are all mine? Of course. That good Christian doesn't do a bad deal. He's already talked about doing it next year. I've never seen anything like it! Is that what people call a fortune? It might not be for some people... but for a shepherdess from the hills... ...of course it's a fortune. Tell me... How much would it cost not to have the dead thrown from the cemetery? To make a tomb? And to care for a sick person... ...by the best doctor in the world? How much would it cost? Your mother probably needs no more than to live a normal life... ..amongst other men and women... ...and in a proper house. In the meantime the two of them could well live here. In the attic bedrooms... They're not very big, but they're clean... and it would be better than a cave. You're mother mightn't talk much, but as I talk for two... ...that'll balance the conversation! Where is she your mother...? Have you lost her? She's at Ugolin's vigil. That's no place for a woman... and certainly no place for her! You should go and fetch her. Maurice, you go with her. I've got dinner cooking... I can't come with you. You do it. Does she want us to come here? That's what I was led to believe. That's not possible. Why? You've done so much for me, that... ...I've no right to accept anything more. It'll only be for a few days. After that, we'll see. You know that gifts from the poor can never be refused. Are you poor?! I'm not living in poverty... but I'm not as rich as you. You'll be able to live off your annuities. I really don't think I'll be able to. You'll soon see how easy it is. Especially if you stay here. You're not still thinking of moving to Aubagne, are you? I don't know. This whole thing's overwhelming me. I can't decide about anything. I can barely remember my name. What's really funny is... ...is that the Pichauris gypsy told me it would happen. She was collecting plants in the hills... I gave her directions, and to thank me... ...she read the lines on my palm. Those lines can tell you a lot. She said to me... "St Jean one more time... "and all your stars are dancing. "I see a young man in your life. He commands and you obey... "and he will arrange your affairs." That made me laugh... I thought she meant a lover. But then...it was you. Yes, it was me. Fantastic! I have a fantastic idea! Not at the moment, thanks. Not at the moment...but 15 minutes ago... You know the old presbytery? It belongs to the municipality. So? So I've rented it for 10 francs a year. To whom? To her and her mother. To do what with? To live there. What do you say about that? I'm very grateful. Sounds a great idea! It could be turned into a mansion with 5 or 6 umbrellas. The roofing can be completely redone. As she's loves setting traps... ...she'll be able to feast on all the rats there. The holes can be blocked up with bottle-bottoms and cement. What will be very convenient, is that in the morning... ...you'll be able to pass the coffee pot under the bedroom door. Why do you have to be so negative about it. P?toffi's fixing the roof. Elz?ar the fittings. Pamphile is making some doors. And I'm making... a fool of myself. If I'd had a bit of education, you wouldn't treat me this way. So... So...too bad... But we meant well...eh? That's OK. See you. That reminds me that I have to take care... ...that I have to find my mayoral sash. I lent it to the children, last week... ...they were playing at weddings... ...and I don't know what they've done with it. Now that I think about it... ...I seem to remember seeing my mayor's sash... ...on the perch in the henhouse. Au revoir. So we'll drop the presbytery idea? I'll go and sort out about my sash. The mayor's a nice guy... but rather weird. Very weird, and not nearly as interesting as your gypsy. Give me your hand. Why...do you know how to read it? Certainly I know how to. And I only tell you the things that I'm completely sure about. Take this one for example... That shows misery...savagery...grief... ...solitude. - What about those little lines? - Of course...I'll tell you... There's a star. Whereabouts? - Can't you see it? - Not really. Call it a small sun... That's your fortune. That has come. Can you see other things? Can't see any presbytery...no. This hand shows no sign of a presbytery. But something that is quite clear... and that is love. Is it me loving someone... or someone loving me? I don't know if YOU love someone... ...but there's someone who loves YOU. Who is it? That's strange... He seems to be very young... ...almost a child... ...because he goes to school every day. Yes...twice a day at the local school. If it's not one of my pupils... ...it can only be me. Are you making fun of me? Now I've forgotten where I left my goats. What a fatal slip! A total catastrophe! Where are the goats...so?! We'll go and find them. Just give me a minute to catch my breath! You're not scared to go out at night with me? I'd go out with you to the ends of the earth. There's no need to do that... Since we're here... ...it's easiest to stay here. Come with me, Manon of the Spring... There are a hundred thousand crickets singing in the grass... ...with the grasshoppers out in the fennel... ...and a cicada singing her dying aria. Come. We'll go call your lost goats and go on up to "Rosemary" where by now, poor Ugolin may have been pardoned by Jean de Florette. There's no need to say anything... ...but perhaps if we look up... ...into the depths of the night sky... we'll read the message of our stars. Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
