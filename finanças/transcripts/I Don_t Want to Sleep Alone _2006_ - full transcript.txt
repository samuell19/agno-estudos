And if I still can't find you, I'd rather wear my monk's robes, and rest in my coffin. Piao Hong! Piao Hong....! I vow to bring you back. If you fly to the skies, I will fly to the skies. If you sink to the ocean floor, I will sink to the ocean floor. So, let it be, oh Sister! Piao Hong! Piao Hong! My voice is weakened and my body frail, but you are still not in sight. Only the waves keep rolling by, if not for you, I would have flown, into the depths of an alligator?s belly. If not for you 'Sister Piao Hong', I would have sunk into the ocean deep under water, pity this pitiful monk. I cry and I cry but no one responds. Sigh, my love, pity this pitiful monk.

Chen supposedly wrote it for himself. He was in love with Lee Hsiang-Lan then. Chen is said to have been very handsome. Unfortunately, he was already engaged, or maybe even married.

Back in those days, there were very few male singers. So Lee Hsiang-Lan sang it in the end, and the title was changed to suit her. A spring breeze in the winter night, awakens my heart with a ripple.

I hide timidly from your bright eyes, even amidst clouds of whirling dust, I can find you easily. My true heart tells me, when I realize this is an eternal myth, my true heart will melt away. I need you. What is it? Come, let me help you. Come on. It's very heavy. I want to stay in your arms, because you are the only one for me.

Spring in Jiang Nan is lovely in March. Can you hear the canaries singing of love?
