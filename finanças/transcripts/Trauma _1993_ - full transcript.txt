- Hello. Hi, sweetheart. When am I going to see you? Uh-uh. I won't be ready by then. I've got one last patient. I know it's late, but this is someone new. I couldn't say no. They were really insistent. What could I do? I got healing powers in my hands. Mm-hmm. For you too, babe. But with you, I'm rough. Hi. Welcome. Please come in. Well, before we begin, I like to get a thorough history of all new patients. So if you'll just fill out this questionnaire, put your coat over there, fill out this questionnaire for me, we can get started. So, from what you said on the phone, it sounds like you have a herniated disk. I know you're in a lot of pain. I haven't treated you before, have I? You look familiar. I almost never forget a face. - Give me your hand! - Leave me alone! - Come on, I can help you. Come on, what do you want to do? Kill yourself? Yeah. - No, come on, come on, come on, come on. Yeah, that's it. - I don't want your help. Let me go, let me go. - No, no, no, no. - Let me go, please. Oh my God! - Stay with me, stay with me! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Come on, stop struggling. Come on, stop struggling, I can help you. You don't want to do this. - Yes, yes I want to. - Everything's going to be okay. Come on, just give me your hand. Come over here. - I...I want to. - That's it, that's it. Come on. Oh, you -- Oh my God. Oh, god. - What are you looking at? - I was looking at this beautiful bracelet you got there. Hey, you want to get something to eat? - I had lunch. - Or we could get some ice cream or something. - No, I got to go away. - What's your hurry? Come on. - What's it to you? What's it to you? - Well, I thought we maybe we'd get some coffee or something, huh? No? Hey, why don't you just mind your own business, all right? Everything's all right. Hey, everything's okay, huh? Come on, don't worry. Get in the car, and everything's going to be okay. - There you go. - Thank you. You want this one? - No, thank you. - Well, then, which one do I eat first? They both look so good, don't they? - No, not to me. - You give this much grief to your parents? - I don't see my parents. - You mean you don't live at home? - No, I live on my own. I've got my own money. - How old are you, 14 or 15? - 16. - Still go to school? - Stop grilling me. Stop, okay? - I'm sorry. It's just that I... I used to have some track marks like that myself. - You don't know anything about me. - Yes, I do. - Oh, no you don't. - If you got a drug problem, I could help you out. - Look, I don't have a problem with drugs. Just... Are you happy? Hmm? Are you happy that I'm eating, hmm? - Yeah. - Okay, fine. I'm going to the bathroom. - Hold it, miss. We want to talk to you. - Me? - Yeah. - I haven't done anything. You're making a mistake. I'm a visiting student from Romania. - Looks like we got the winning ticket. - I haven't committed any crime. - We just want to take you back to the Farraday Clinic. - No. - Aura Petrescu. - Come on. - No, please. No, don't take me back, sir. I got lots of money. I can give you thousands of dollars. Please! - No, no, don't worry, we're not going to take you. - No, I don't want to go back! - The law says we gotta bring you back to your parents. - No! - We'll take you to the clinic, you're okay. - The law says we have to take you back to your parents. - No! Fuck you! - You can't do this. - That's enough. - Break it up, everything's under control. Break it up, guys. Come on, let's move on. - Bitch. - Home sweet home, huh? - Yes, what do you want? - Good afternoon, we're from Metro Youth Service. - Yes? - We have Aura. - Aura? You have Aura? Oh, my poor little baby. I am the mother of this difficult but very beautiful little girl. My thanks to both of you gentlemen for bringing my baby back home. Very kind, thank you. It's for your own good that we put you in the clinic, and that's where you stay, you understand, until we decide. - Mamica, Mamica, I hate the cell. Please don't make me go back. I'll die. - Look who's come back to us. Two policemen brought her home. - What a surprise. Always making trouble for your mother. - I'm sorry, Dada, but they're horrible at the clinic. They're trying to kill me. - Take her upstairs. Bring her some tea. - This is too much shouting for her. Your mother's very angry. - I know, Dada, but please let me stay here. - Aura, enough. - I swear I'll be better. - Your mother has a lot to think about today. - Another seance? - A big one. I'll bring you some dinner later, huh? Try to eat. Make your mother happy. - I'm not hungry. - Aura, you have to eat. That's why you're going back to the clinic. - No. No! Good evening, Steve, it's Stephanie. - Hello. - So good to see you. Let me take your umbrella. - It's a foul night, Stefan, but maybe the spirits will like it. - She's very good. When Nicholas starts talking, watch my hands. - I'm the one who telephoned. - Ah, - Oh my god. - Am I late? - Aura? - Questions? - Will we be able to contact my mother? - Shh. - We have so many questions, we who have gathered here. Nicholas, my precious, will you help us? Nicholas, are you here with us tonight? I am searching for you. - Let me in. This is not Nicholas. Some other soul is here with us tonight, trying to break through. Some...some soul. One of those who follow the recent dead, who follow their Killers. Speak. My head. - My head. - Took my head. - Took my head. - Murdered me. - Murdered me. - A monster with a noose. - A monster with a noose. I wasn't the first. - I wasn't the first. - And I won't be the last. - And I won't be the last. - I know who the Killer is. - I know who the Killer is. - I'm the only one who knows. - I'm the only one who knows. - The killer is present! - The killer is present! - Don't break the chain! Don't move, don't move! - I see you! - I see you. - You cannot hide from me! - You can't hide from me. - I know who you are. - I know you. - Mama! Mama! Mama! Dada! Stop! Stop! Papal Ah! - What? - Dada! Mama! - What did you see? You have to tell me! You must have seen something. Who was it? - ...I didn't see anything. He had...he had their heads in front of his face. - Check these weird things out on the wall. They may be something from the occult. - It is getting late. Take me home. - There was something wrong tonight from the beginning. I could feel it in the room. - So neither of you heard anything? - Did she have any other relatives besides her parents? - No one. You know, Captain, until her recent escape, she was under my care. - Is that so? - She was a patient of mine at the Faraday Clinic. It was her parents' wish. - What was wrong with her? - I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to say, Captain, but it has nothing to do with this case. We're prepared to take her back. Sh-sh-she needs our help. - Well, tomorrow you go downtown and you file papers with the Youth Services. I'm sure they'll hand her over to you after we're done questioning her. - A bizarre double murder brings a madman's total to four. - Striking steel workers go back to the bargaining table. - Warm weather price hikes put a dent in your pocketbook. - Tonight on the -- - It sounds like you could have some fun with that one. They say they're calling him The Headhunter. - So I've heard. - I suppose Grace told you, huh? - Yeah, we communicate now and then. - I suppose she told you what the guy looks like? - Don't worry about it, nobody saw you, Mark. - Oh, very funny. You're a laugh riot. Now, could we do some actual work around here, please? Arnie, what are you doing, besides putting on pounds? - Ha ha. We got a leading composite using last night's KKK rally, and the space shuttle landing, and the president's trip to Belgrade. - Hmm, any sex? - Hmm. Probably. The first lady's not going. - Ah, forget it. I think there was some sex on that Tour de France item. Go with that. - God, I am not going on in front of this. - Welcome back, Grace. - Can't we go with something a little more stylized? - Well, I did do this, but it's not finished yet. - Oh, much better. - No, that is not better. I prefer just plain type, maybe something like "Head Hunter." - Oh, perfect, great idea. - Keep it tasteful. - Well, I have to get back. Ben needs me to rehearse some of his ad libs. - Hey, Grace, that is a fabulous outfit on you. - I know what he'll give her. - What? - Big, blood red letters. - Three feet high. Hello. Yes, it is. Of course I want it back, where the hell are you? - I only took $6.00. ...needed some food. I've been wandering around since last night. - How'd you find me? - Your ID card. I tried your home first. - You haven't got any place to go? - No. - So you're looking for a place to stay? - No, I need something else. You kept trying to help me, so I thought... - Okay, so you need some more money. - No. - What? - I want to go home. - You want to go home? I'll take you home. Come up to my office and call your parents. It's gonna be okay. No? You don't want to come upstairs and call your parents? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, it's okay, it's okay. Look, I'm gonna go upstairs and get my keys, all right? Huh? Are you okay? - Two more decapitation victims were claimed last night at a home adjacent to Inverness Park in the city's northwest side. The victims are believed to be professional mediums Stefan and Adriana Petrescu. - Captain Travis, do you know if the victims were randomly chosen or part of a pattern? - All we know is the victims were paralyzed by a blow to the spine and were probably conscious during their murder. - See, they never get anything out of these assholes. - Guys, I'm gonna take off for a while. - Immigrated from Romania 10 years ago and are survived by their only daughter, Aura, age 16. - Tell Grace I had to leave. I got a lead on a real good story. - Their daughter has also been missing since last evening. - I don't know why you want to go home, Aura. - I need to get some clothes. How do you know my name? - I saw it on the news. Hey, I'm really sorry. I can't imagine how you're feeling right now. Don't you have some relatives or family you could go stay with? - Look, it's none of your business. - I'm just trying to help you out. - I don't need your help. - I don't think we should be going to this house here. I think you should be going to see a doctor. - Doctors? Look, look, I don't need more doctors. ...I just got out of the Farraday Clinic. I really don't need more doctors. I need answers. I want to know who killed my parents. Stop here, don't park too near. - The power's out. It must have been that storm last night. Are you sure you want to do this? - Yes. - All right, show me where the basement is. - It's down here. It's in here, I think. - Perfect. I'll be right back. - Mama. Mama! And I won't be the last. - I know who the Killer is. - I know who the Killer is. - I'm the only one who knows. - I'm the only one who knows. - The killer is present! - The killer is present! - I...I barely recognize... - Recognize who? - Mother. - It's the first time I've heard this. - It's okay. Hey, it's okay. Come on, come on. - What happened? - Someone broke my fucking window. It must have been a warning. Goddammit. - The police! - Okay, just stay down, stay down. - Hi. I hear you've got a big story for me. Trying to muscle in on my turf, huh? Listen, call me at the station if you're back by 10, then I'm on the air again. Bye. - Gabriel, what are you doing? Go to bed. - Mom, some lady in that house keeps looking at me. She doesn't move. - Go to bed. There's no lady there. Yes there is. She keeps looking at me. A black lady. - Well, I'm sorry to call so late, Mr. Farraday, but you've been out. - Well, we had a board meeting tonight. One subject I need hardly tell you was that young woman who escaped. - Aura Petrescu. - Dr. Judd, the clinic doesn't need this kind of publicity. - Leave it to me, Mr. Farraday. I'll find her. - My head. - My head. - Took my head. - Took my head. - Hello? - I was, um, thinking about coming over tonight. - Well, not tonight, Grace. - You don't want to see me? - Well, actually, there's, uh... there's someone else here. She's asleep in the other room. - Someone I know? - No. This girl I met. She had no place else to go. - Well, goodbye then. - Grace. She told me she's anorexic. I don't know why I didn't figure it out myself. - Well, look, don't beat yourself up about it. Anorexics are always secretive. They're good little girls, they hide their problems. - Really? What else? - Well, let's see. Um, deeply attached to an unstable mother. Upper middle class girls. Boys, too, actually. Usually the brighter, artistic ones. Um, let's see. What else? Oh, yeah. How can I forget? Sex. - What about sex? - Well, did you get in her pants? - Arnie, she's just a kid. - Okay, did you get in her play clothes? - No. - Didn't think so. Anorexics are afraid of sex. They want to get back to their childhood, before all the scary stuff started. There's something like eight million of them out there. - How do you know all this? - 'Cause I watch Oprah and Donahue. Doesn't everybody? - No, I don't watch those shows. - Ah, well, see, there's your problem. - This is television! This is a big deal. This is not something you can just kind of walk in and -- - See, you should be watching that thing and eating this stuff. - You know, that's one way to fend off anorexia. - Look, seriously, your friend may be in real danger. A lot of anorexics die. A lot of them commit suicide. The worst part is, she won't let you help her. I mean, she wants you to help her, but she won't. - How did she end up that way? - Trouble with her parents. It's said these girls will even have like a classic dream. She'll dream her father's leaning over her, about to kiss her. - Catocala Promethea. Telea Polyphemus. - Can you hear me? - That guest of yours still here? - Yeah. - You don't sound so sure. - Believe me, Grace, I got nothing to hide. If you wanna come over tonight, feel free. - Maybe I will. - Aura, how you doin'? - Oh, David, I keep replaying that night in my mind. - Well, I'll be off soon, should I bring us home some food? - Oh, I just ate. - Really? - I made a huge mess of your kitchen, actually. I cooked some chicken pot pie, french fries, but now I'm just tired and I want to go to sleep. - Aura, I'm worried about you. - It's okay, I'll just see you later. Bye. But she just cooked herself a meal, Arnie, she's gotta be making progress. - No. She was probably lying, David. They're not easy to cure, that's why a lot of 'em end up dead. - A lot of anorexics die. There's something like eight million of them out there. Deeply attached to an unstable mother. She'll dream her father is leaning over her, about to kiss her. - What was that? - I didn't hear anything. - No, I heard something. - What was it? - She's gone. - So? - So, I'm going after her. - Don't be ridiculous, she's not that easily shocked. - Look, Grace, come on, she's just a kid. - She's exploiting you like everybody else. - Believe me, Grace, she needs help. She's suicidal. She's been in that goddamn Farraday Clinic for the past month. - The Farraday Clinic? No kidding. - Yeah, they abused her, so she ran away. - She's a manipulative little psycho. Let her go. - Fuck you, Grace. - David. David! Damn! - No. I'm sorry about last night. I wanted to, but I couldn't. Are you angry with me? - No. Are you angry with me? - No, I'm not angry at you. - Okay, good, 'cause I have to go to work. - Why? - Why? Because I have to pretend like I'm a regular person, you know. Hey, why don't you go over to the farmer's market and find some vegetables and fruit that looks good to you and buy it. - Okay. I'll try to make you a dinner. - Aura! You better talk to me! I'm gonna help you! I - No! gonna help you! - No! - Aural - Do you see it? I told you, you get everything you need from watching TV. The 18th, the 23rd, and the 29th. Don't you get it? - My god. He only kills when it's raining. - So stay out of the rain. Yeah? Yeah, he's here, hang on. It's for you. It's your new girlfriend. - David, I went to that market and there I saw Dr. Judd. He chased me, I ran away, and Oh no! No, let me go! - Aura? Aura, are you back there? - Aura? - She's not here. - What do you mean she's not here? Where the hell is she? - Well, I was concerned. Concerned about you. Concerned about her. You told me yourself the child was suicidal. So, I did what any normal, responsible person would do. I called the Farraday Clinic. They just came and took her away. - You called the Farraday Clinic? You should be ashamed of yourself. Dammit. - Who'd have thought we'd meet again so soon? Shall I attribute it to my charming personality? Sit. You can go. Miss Petrescu is an old friend. Aura, you're all alone now and I must take care of you. But everything depends upon you, on whether you're willing to look inside yourself and confront the past. - No, you're not interested in me. There is something you want. - I want you to get well. That's all I want. But the secret lies in there. Don't be afraid. You see, each human being's head contains the soul, the one remaining riddle of the universe. Look inside the head, unlock the memory, and the universe lies open like a map. Aura, you see this? This will help you remember everything. - What is it? - A very rare berry. A potent psychotropic. - It's a drug. I don't want any drug. - It's not a drug! It works on the memory. It removes all obstacles. Don't be afraid. Come on. Take it. - Mm-mmm. - Crush the berry with your teeth and swallow the liquid. - No. - Here. - No. - Come on, come on! That's it, that's it. Now crush it, crush it. The power of your brain and imagination is stronger than a Vulcan. - I remember now. It was you. - Go on. Go on. - I don't want to see it. His face.. his face was hidden behind Mama's and Papa's head. - Whose face? You saw him. Tell me. Whose face, Aura? - I didn't see anything. - I don't believe you. - It's the truth. - Dammit! Take her to her room and put her back on the feeding tubes. - Where am I? - But don't hurt her! - Please, please, let me go. Oh no, no! No. No. - You get it. - No, miss, please. - Come on, honey. Hold still or I'm just gonna have to stick it in again. - No. - The more you fight, the longer you're gonna be in here. Now, come on. - Evening. - Come on. - Please. - Come on. Come on, honey, hold still. Okay. That's got it. - Hi. - I'm looking for Aura Petrescu. Her room number, please. - Okay. I can't give out that information. And besides, visiting hours are over. - Right. - Hi. Where were you? Okay, I don't even want to hear any excuses. - Oh. - Shh, shh, shh, it's me. Are you okay? - They drugged me. - They drugged you? Where'd you get these? - I...I stole them. - You stole them? Okay. You wait right here, okay? Wait right here. You gonna be okay? Yeah? Okay. Stay right here. Hi. - You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. We need to get out of here. - You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. - Tonight, the prestigious Farraday Clinic was the scene of the latest in a series of gruesome decapitations which have terrorized the city for weeks. - Aura! Aura, come here. - -- are not saying much. - Someone from the Farraday Clinic was killed. I knew it! - She...she was...she was my nurse. - She was your nurse? - Volkmann was apparently attacked and beheaded while on night duty -- - She worked with Dr. Judd, she put the needles in my arms. - Well, did you see anything? Huh? Did you hear anything? - No. Wherever I go, people get killed. - Oh, come on. I mean, you're not responsible for her death. - Their Chief Executive, Dr. Leopold Judd, could not be reached for comment. - You're not a murderer. You're...you're a thief. - On the local scene, the weather is now clearing, but the rain was the cause of a major traffic tie-up. - These are her keys. It's all my fault, David. - About half a mile south of the parkway exit. Witnesses say that the large truck and trailer, which were delivering new cars -- - Marigold? I know this place, it's a storage place. - -- then jackknifed and overturned at that -- - Now, it's time to shut off the TV and go on up to bed. I want you asleep by the time I come home. - Mm-hmm. - You're not scared to go to bed alone, are you? - No, Mom. - Bye-bye. I love you. - Bye. - He had her head in front of his face. I couldn't see him. That's the truth. - The cops might have been here already. - No way, 'cause they don't know about this place. - Yeah, well, they're gonna find out about it. They're gonna find something in Hilda's apartment, a key or a receipt. Come on, we can't stay here all day. - The broad who rents this space, she's been here seven, maybe eight years. - I could count the number of times she showed up on one hand. - Hey, the cops! Come on, let's go! Come on, come on, now! Let's go! - Wait, wait, the key, the key! - Just leave it for the cops, come on! - Look, this is strange. All these people are dead. - Oh my god. She's dead, she's dead, and she's dead. - "Dear Hilda, in memory of the crazy times we used to have. Love, Linda." That must be her. - L. Quirk. Linda Quirk, 992 Benton Road. She lives like a mile from here. At least, she did when this picture was taken. - What do you think this is? - Some sort of insignia, or a crest or something. - I think he's the Killer, the doctor. - Well, how do you know that? She could be the Killer. - She doesn't look like a killer. - You don't know what a Killer looks like. Anybody could be a killer. I'm gonna send this to the cops tomorrow. Anonymously. - Tomorrow could be too late. - I knew her, Alice. I knew Georgia and Catherine, too. That's what's so damn scary about this. - We were all involved in it. - In what? - An accident. - Before you met me? - Electroconvulsive therapy. That was my specialty. - You mean, shock treatment? - I thought I knew all there was to know about it, including how to make people forget. - Quirk, Quirk. Quirk. There it is. Yeah, there's an L. Quirk, but it's on Sunset Lane. I don't know. - But why? What did you do? - Something awful. I don't know how we thought we'd get away with it. - Hello? - Linda Quirk? - Just a second. It's a guy, he's asking for you. - Hello? - I'm looking for a Linda Quirk. Why? Who's this? - Would you happen to know a Hilda Volkmann? She hung up. - Try again. That's her, all right. We'd better head out there. There they are. It's them. Come here! Come here! - What? What? What the fu -- - I just want to talk to you. - David! - Goddammit! I don't see her. - I think we should turn left. - Ah. I'm gonna make a right. Shit! We lost her. - Turn around. There it is. It's there. - Right, that's it. - Okay. - I knew it. - Okay. - How can I help you? - Yeah, I'm looking for a guest. Woman, short brown hair, blue gym bag, checked in a little while ago. - And her name? - Here's the problem, I don't know her name. - I'm sorry, sir, unless you have a name... - I'm supposed to meet her here. - I'm afraid I can't help you, sir. Would you like to register? - Yeah, I'd like to register. My sister and I. Mark Leneer, 140 Westview Crescent, Oak Park. And I'd like to overlook the parking lot. - The parking lot? - Yeah, the parking lot. - Okay, room 201. The bellman will take your bags. - I don't have any bags. I can see her car perfectly. - Do you think it's gonna rain? - It was a beautiful day, it's definitely not gonna rain. - Hello? Linda, is that you? - Oh, thank God you're okay. I checked into a hotel and I want you to get out of there and over here right now. - Whoa, slow down. I think you overreacted earlier. It was just a couple of kids. They didn't look dangerous at all. You're jumping at shadows. - Look, I don't know who those two were. All I know is that I'm in danger, and so are you if you're in my house. Please, just get over here. - Jesus, maybe we should call the police. - We'll talk about it when you get here. - Okay. Where are you? - The Hopkins House, Room 301. Right by the airport. - I'm on my way. - Be careful. - Bye. - David? - What is it? - Nothing, I just wanted to know if you were still here. - Of course I'm still here. - Go away. - Why? - Because I don't want you to get rained on. - Hello. Yes, send her right up. - Mrs. Bailey! That's my wife. Here, I'll take it here. Mary? Hello, listen dear, I'm sorry. No! No! - What is this about? - Lloyd. Lloyd. Lloyd. - Dr. Kravitz, you have a visitor in the main lobby. - That's Dr. Lloyd. - Dr. Lloyd? Does he still work here? - No, he left a long time ago. But, uh, he showed up again a few years back. He looks terrible. He tried to sneak away with some stuff out of the dispensary, if you catch my drift. - Yeah, I catch your drift. Do you know where I could find him? Last I heard, he was living down at the warehouse district. You might look into some of the bars there. - Okay, thanks. - That's Hilda Volkmann. She used to work here. Uh, Linda Quirk -- - Harry, I know who the women are. I'm interested in who the man is. - Oh, Dr. Lloyd. Funny, young fellow by here a little while ago had the same picture. - What did you tell him? - I sent him over to the warehouse district. - Hey! - You want something? - Are you Dr. Lloyd? - Yeah, maybe in another lifetime. Hey, you got any money, man? - No, I ain't got no money. But Linda Quirk, Hilda Volkmann. Do those names sound familiar to you? Come on, Catherine Duran, Georgia Jackson -- - Leave me alone, man. - They're dead, you know that? - So, people die. It happens every day. - They were decapitated. - What? - I said, they were decapitated. - Oh, man. Man, that wasn't my fault. - I know, but if you're Dr. Lloyd, come on, you've got to tell me something. - Look, man, it's already too late. - Come on, please, you've got to know something. - I don't! Now, leave me the fuck alone! - Listen, I wrote my number down. If you change your mind, please, call me. - This used to be the nice neighborhood. - This is all we found on him. A phone number. David. - What's that? - Aura. Come with me. Wake up. Aura. Aura. Aura. Aura, come with me. Come, come! - No! No! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop right now! No! No! No! No! No! Stop! - Come. - Stop! - Stop, police! - I loved her. I loved her. - Guys, come take a look at this. - Whoa, buddy, stop right here. It's off limits. Come on, move out of here. Restricted area. - All right. - Go all the way around. - I got another one over here. - He's sick. - Jesus, look over there. - No, don't look. Don't look at it. - I got two in the trunk. - The smell. - Don't touch anything. - Aura. Aura? No! Aural Aural Aura? Ruby rain - Aura! Aura, come back! Aura? Aura? Aural Aura, where are you? Aural Aural I miss you so badly. - Aura? Aura? Too late now Ruby rain - Save her. - What did he say? - I think he said, "save her." - Hmm, a little late for that. - Save her. Save her. Save her. - The Headhunter terror, which has gripped the city for the last several weeks, ended early this morning when a late model Cadillac burst through a police barrier and slammed into a guardrail near Lake Veronica. The driver, Dr. Leopold Judd, was killed instantly. The severed heads of all seven Headhunter victims were found in the trunk of his car. Ben Aldridge was on the scene and spoke with police authorities. - Captain Travis, was Dr. Judd the killer? - Well, with the evidence we found here, it definitely connects him to these murders. - And what was his motive? - Well, apparently, he had this ghoulish obsession with the occult. Besides that, I see no other motive. - Are you going to continue your investigation, Captain? - As far as I'm concerned, this case is closed. - What drove the esteemed Leopold Judd, a brilliant psychiatrist, specialist in the treatment of anorexia, and long-time Chief Executive at Farraday Clinic, to commit these crimes? What did the victims have in common? Did they share a secret or a past which finally reunited them through their grisly fates? These and many other questions will be the subject of our upcoming special report. But one thing is clear: the nightmare is over. - Grace Harrington, please. Grace, it's me, David. I need some of those forms. Come on, Grace. Please? Just a couple of them, please? Okay, okay. Fine, yeah. Yeah, fine. - It was a real surprise to me that she got divorced. - Well, what if she didn't? - Oh, I was so shocked. Who's that? - Out of 19. Thank you. - Thank you. - Mike, come here. This prescription's phony. That guy, there. - Hey, buddy! Hey, that prescription was a fake. - Hey, man. - Just give it back. - Give it back. - Hey, fuck you, all right. - Look at this poor slob. - You're a bum! - Serves you right, goddamn drug addict. - Hi. Have you seen a girl in a dark coat go by here? Are you sure? I'll be your best friend. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were somebody else. Someone who wore a bracelet -- Shh. My god. Aura? Aura? - Nicholas. Nicholas. Nicholas. Nicholas. Nicholas. Nicholas. Nicholas. Nicholas. Nicholas. Nicholas. Nicholas. Nicholas. Nicholas. Nicholas. Nicholas. - You thought I was Aura? It was only me. You wanted to see Aura. - Aura. Aura. I knew I would see you again. - I knew I would see you again, too. - Where are we? - In my mother's house. - Oh. That was her up there? - Yes, it was. - She's alive? Oh. Well, Christ, where is she now? - She's upstairs. Quick, quick, quick. There isn't much time. I'm trying to keep her out. At least we try. Are you okay? - But I still don't get it. I thought your mother was dead, huh? You said you saw her, didn't you? - I saw a corpse. But it was not hers, it was a neighbor woman. - Oh my god. - She faked her own death. I should have seen the truth. It was right in front of my face. In the dark, it looked as if someone was holding up two severed heads, but there was only one, my father's. - I was sure that Judd had murdered your mother. - No. No. He never killed anyone. But he knew who the murderer was... Mama. - Help! Somebody help us! Help us get out of here! I can't believe your mother killed those people. - She did. - Are you sure she killed your father? - Yes! - Why? Why? She's coming. She's coming. - Remove the chain. - No. - Don't do it. - Don't lock your mother outside. Oh, Aura, you know me. - I'm not listening to you. - You know I would never hurt you. Now, remove it. Remove the chain. - No. - Remove it! - No! - Remove it, now! Now! Now! Now! - Why are you doing this? - I thought after the others, I would stop. - Please, please, please. - Why did you kill them, huh? - Because of.. Nicholas. Nicholas. - Push. Good, good. Come on. Push. - Okay, stop, stop. People, we've got trouble. - Get back, what happened? - What the? - Decapitated! - Somebody help her! We've got to get somebody to do something! - Anybody! Anybody! Help! - Come on, Doctor. Pull it together here. Come on. - Just do it. - Oh, they butchered my son! - Say yes. - Do it. - Nurse, please! Goodbye, my son! They thought they could make me forget, but Nicholas came to me. He ordered the deaths of those who had murdered him. And so I've done it. And you know my secret! - Don't look! - Nicholas, Nicholas, Nicholas. - No, Mama! No! - Miss Petrescu, I'd like to ask you a few questions. Get these goddamn reporters out of here. You knew Dr. Judd. Is there anything you can tell me about him? Dr. Judd? - Dr. Judd. - Was he working with your mother? - Working... - Were they lovers? - Lovers... - Did your mother commit the murders? - Commit the murders... - Did your mother commit these murders? Let him go, let him go. Aura, it's over. It's me, David. Huh? It's over. I'm never gonna hurt you. I looked all over for you. - I love you. We'll all be waiting, we'll all be waiting, We've all been waiting, we've all been waiting We've all been waiting for so long All been waiting for so long Waiting for someone to come along, yeah Someone who can love I and I is strong Someone who can never, never, never go wrong Until you can do Ruby rain, sliding down my face Ruby rain, following my trace too late now I've found you Ruby rain, dripping in the dark Ruby rain, puddles in my heart I'll miss you so badly
