Last week was embarrassing. Probably the worst tourney of my entire career. Open those balls, let's go. You didn't bring new balls? - Yeah, they're new balls, I just opened them. - In the bathroom? - Yes, in the bathroom.

Now I actually enjoy hurting people. (laughs) - Miles. We are a family here so you can feel safe. Continue. - I'm feeling that. Thank you. Thank each of you for listening. I'm feeling very calm right now. - With all due respect, Tony. I have massive issues and I have a huge tournament coming up and I need my five minutes to express this anxiety before you-know-who pulls the plug. So if you would just pl-- (punches) (Miles groaning) - Go on. (fast rock music) (ball pinging) - I think she's out. - [Jerry] It's alright, I'm a little stiff anyway. - Hey, good job, bro. Excuse the mess. Here you go, baby. - Thank you. - You know what? I think we got a good shot at the tourney, Jer. - You know, Miles, I'm not playing in that tournament. - Stop saying that. I need this, Jerry. You need this. - So you know who plays over in that club, right? The Goliath brothers, or whatever. - The Gollant brothers. - Yes, and they've won those tournaments for, like, the last 50 years. You're just setting yourself up for failure again. - What are you afraid of? Is that it, are you afraid, you're afraid to lose, right? - You are brilliant. Thanks for figuring me out, Miles. - That's your problem. You're not willing to take risks. There's this great saying, no guts no glory. You ever heard that? - No, never. I can't believe we're doing this. - Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do, Jerry. - [Rob] Woo! (laughing) - We can beat them. - Power! - Hey, enough with that. They've got to have a weakness. - [Jerry] It's definitely not their service game. - Definitely not. Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out! I did notice one thing. They love to play the sidelines, they leave a lot of country open mid court. (motorcycle rumbling) Good talk. I'll see you tomorrow? - [Jerry] Yup. - Hey, we're gonna have some fun at this tournament, and we're gonna kick some butt. You know what I always say, get busy living or get busy dying. - Isn't that from a movie? - What? No, no. - Miles, I just really don't want to bomb. I've bombed too much already. - We're not gonna bomb, bro. Eye of the cougar, Jerry. Eye of the cougar. - Okay. - Daddy! - Hey, sweetie. What you reading? - Charlotte's Web. - I loved Charlotte. Who's your favorite? - Wilbur, he's so cute. Can we get a pig, Dad? They make small ones. - They make small ones, huh? Come on, let's get out of here. (folksy guitar music) (chattering and laughing) All right. - Thank you. - [Jerry] All right. The moment of truth. - Dad! - Oh. Sorry. - Dear God, thank you for this day. Dad, did you have a good day? - Yes, I had a good day. - Good. Please help all the children in the world. Thank you for this food, amen. - Amen. It's a good one tonight, huh? - [Tyler] Almost a Timbuktu, right? - [Jerry] What? - That's what you used to tell me about the sunset. - Well, what did I say anyway? That we're traveling around the universe a million miles an hour, and the sun is shining light on all the people in Africa, India, Australia. - And Hong Kong and Timbuktu. - Yep. All those places keeping everyone warm. And just think about it, when you're asleep tonight, some little girl in Timbuktu is watching the sunset with her dad. - I like that. We did good tonight, right Dad? - Yeah, not bad. - Almost as good as Mom's. - Get some sleep. - [Tyler] Are you okay, Dad? - Yeah. Goodnight my angel from Montgomery. - [Tyler] Goodnight, dad. (TV playing) - It's okay, honey. (sighs) - [Nurse] The patient has a ruptured appendix. - [Doctor] Last blood pressure? - 65 over 28. - Alright, Dr. Rosen's gonna be in the O.R. waiting for us. - Jerry, hey. - [Jerry] Hey... - [Sam] Sam. - Sam. - [Sam] How are you? - Of course, I knew that. I'm doing well. How are you doing? - Good. - Sorry, that was awkward. - It's okay. - So how are things going? - Good, you know, learning, getting the lay of the land. - Well, welcome to my domain. The basement is very underrated. It's actually quite beautiful. - Jerry, could I get a word with you? - Yeah, of course. I'm sorry I've gotta-- - No problem, I'm just gonna-- - Comin' through. - Squeeze by. - Yeah, sorry. - I'll see you later. - Yeah, I'll see you later. - [Boss] Jerry, what's going on in receiving? You didn't notice this? - No, sir, it was clean when I left. - [Boss] Come on, Jerry. - Hi, Tyler. (screaming) - [Jerry] What just happened? Tyler, are you okay? - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-- - [Jerry] What's wrong with you? - I'm sorry, Tyler. - Get off of her. - I'm okay, I'm okay. It just scared me, that's all. - [Jerry] She's ten years old. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean it. - Do you have a brain in your head? - [Tyler] Hi, Miles. - Hi, Tyler. Hey, Tyler. There's this really cool tournament coming up, and the winners get to go to the open, play center court. I want your dad and I to enter. - What's the open? - You should be ashamed. - It's a really big deal if you're a tennis player. And our local pro here thinks that we're gonna win the tournament and get to go. - Awesome, Dad! Can I come? - Definitely. - Stop. You see what you're doing here? - She believes in you. - Yeah, Dad, you can do it. Can't you? - Well, yeah, maybe. There's some guys in that club that are really good. You don't just enter a tournament and win. - I think you can do it. I'm excited. - About what? - The open. - Oh, Tyler, your uncle Miles, how do I say this, is kind of a... - An idiot? - No, no. - I know uncle Miles, but this could be fun. What do we have to lose? (laughing) I love you, Dad. - I love you more. We better win. - I love you, man. - Come on, man. - We are going to the open. We're going to the open. - We still have to win. - We are going to the open! (laughing) - Hey, shut up! - Sorry, Jack. Just, but we're going to the open! - Yes, baby! (whooping) - [Jerry] Hey, Sam. - What's up? - Not much. You're still here. That totally came out wrong. I mean, you're still liking your job here. - Yeah, I've always liked hospitals. Weird, I know. I love blood and guts. - Well, you're in the right spot for blood and guts. - It's made me think about nursing school, actually. Well, that's what I'm thinking currently, anyway. - It's a good job, nursing. I thought I was gonna be a doctor, but I realized I had a love for laundry. It's actually where I'm heading, down to my lair. - Yeah, I've gotta go deliver some delicious meals. - Will you save me one? - Absolutely. See you around. - Yeah, we will. I'll let you know if I find any good blood and guts. (laughs) You're an idiot. (lighthearted guitar music) - What's wrong with you? Beautiful girl tells you she's interested and you just walk away? - She said hello, she's polite. I hardly think she's interested. Besides, I think she's a little bit out of my league, you know. - Not mine, I will tame that doe a deer. - Doe, a deer? Can we just hit? And stop talking. (ball pinging) - BTW, no one is out of your league. I don't want to hear that kind of talk anymore. You need to ask her out. - I'm not asking her out. - It'll help your self confidence, and it'll benefit our play in the tourney. Does she play? - I don't know. Listen, Miles, against my better judgment I decided to play in this round robin tournament with you. I don't really want to add a love life on top of it all. I mean not to mention... - Not to mention what? - I'm a widower, Miles. Okay? And my self confidence is just fine. - All right, whatever you say, boss. - BTW? What is this? - Oh, that? That's nothing. A boy likes me. - I see that. And? - Don't worry, Dad, I get those all the time. Just kidding, that's Gavin. He gives notes to all the girls in our class. He's a player. - A player, really. Did you respond to him? - Not yet, I told him I'd think about it. - But you just remember one thing. For the rest of your life, no matter who you like, you make sure they treat you like a princess; my princess. Because the princess deserves the finest prince in the land. - Well, like I said, I don't want a boyfriend, but if I did, he'd be a good choice. He reminds me of you. - Wow. Well, on that note, let's have some ice cream. - Yeah! With sprinkles? - Well, is there any other way? - Yes! Dad, do you ever think you're gonna get married again? - I don't know, honey. - The king deserves the finest queen, too. - [Jerry] Hey, Sam. - Oh, hey, jerry. - Hey, how's it going? - Good, how are you? - I'm great, thanks. Hey, you know I was wondering if maybe sometime we could go out and have lunch or something, or just, you know, sit outside, coffee, I don't know. - Was that multiple choice? One of the above? - That was a stupid sentence. - I'm just kidding, I'm kidding. No, that sounds great. - Really? - Yeah, really, it sounds fun. - Cool. - You know, this elevator is a little bit slow. Do you want to just take the stairs? - You know, I always take the stairs. - Yeah, okay. (laughing) - I know that I can be a jealous girlfriend. I mean, the-- - Hey, my bike wouldn't start. Some kids pulled the spark plug, hilar-- - Shh, shh. - Tony, stop it. - Are you gonna chill? Are you gonna chill? (kicking) - [Miles] Okay, okay. I'm sorry everyone for being late. - That's okay, Miles. Now, we are all of us working together to find some new approaches, get over our anxiety, and we're listening to Diane. - [Miles] Can I go, because I'm about-- - No. - Is it too much to ask that he's faithful, and instead of going out for a drink with all the girls at work after-- (banging) (motorcycle rumbling) - Hi, Beverly. - You're late! - Yeah, let's start with our ground strokes okay? Let's get in position, come on. A little hustle, Beverly. Come on, let's see a little pep in that step. Hey, give me a little twinkle toes. Just give me a little, show me what you got. Warming it up, warming it up. You ready? Okay Beverly, here we go. Good, remember short backstroke, full follow through. You want to hit the ball as flat as possible. You're not gonna get much spin on the ball at your age, so we want to hit it flat so we can get it over the net. Nice. Here we go, Bev. Short backstroke, full follow through. Full follow! Full follow through, Bev! Good, keep it going. Good. Have you ever considered golf? - Excuse me? - Beverly, I'm not trying to be rude, I'm just trying to help, and I'm just trying to figure out if that's even possible. You get to ride around on a golf cart all day long. It's very relaxing. You can have a pina colada or lemonade. You know what, it's a good idea, Beverly. You did a good job today. I like what's going on. You're doing good, you know, the form is. - Up yours, Miles, I'm not paying you for today. - Well, I opted for vegetables today. (laughs) So what's your story? - Well, I was born a poor black child. (both laughing) - Nice. - You know it? - Yeah, of course, The Jerk. It's one of my favorites. We'll consider your application for the club. - Yes! I'm actually a physical therapist. - Oh, really? Cool. - Thanks, who can't find a job in physical therapy, so I figured better to get a job inside a hospital than behind a bar at a coffee shop. - Hey, watch it. I'm a barista that can't find a job inside a coffee shop. (laughing) - And so you're at the hospital because of your love for laundry? (laughs) - It's a good question. Oh, yeah, I had a daughter. You know, I had to grow up, get a real job. - You have a daughter? - [Jerry] Yeah. - What's her name? - Tyler, she's ten years old. Yeah, I know, I look a lot younger than I really am. She's, she's pretty cool. You know, this has just been terrible having snacks with you. - Agreed. Let's never do it again. - Yeah, deal. Can I get this for you? - Thank you. - You can owe me. - [Sam] I'll get that one. - This is crazy. - [Miles] Good call on the run today. - [Jerry] Yeah, I've got to get in shape, man. - You're really motivated, Jerry, I love it. What do you think our chances are? - Oh, great, you know. I think we're gonna take this all the way. - [Miles] Don't be sarcastic, Jerry. Attitude is 90 percent of the game. I think we start two-a-days. - [Jerry] Nope. - Sometimes I think you and I really blew it. - Why? - Because we should have been club champions at golf. Woo! Instead of tennis. - But sirs, you are the club champions in golf, too. - The club champions, also. Also, not too. But, bravo assistant, you're keeping up. - By the way, the tournament is coming up so I reserved a space in court one from now until then for practice. - [Rob] Good job, assistant, good job. As if we needed practice. (laughs) - Touche! - Get off the tee box. Treat it nice. A thousand bucks a hole? (both laughing) (panting) - So I hung out with Sam today. - Who? OMG, really? You took my advice. Way to go, Jerry, way to go. You didn't. - What are friends for. - I hate you. - [Bridgett] Happy birth-- - No, no, no, no, that's okay, thank you. (laughing) - Aww, we love you, even though you're a butt. - Happy birthday, partner. - Thanks. - So are you gonna blow out the candles or not? - No. You are. And don't spit on the cake. (blowing) Good job. - You spit on the cake. - I know you wished that your pa and I win the tourney, right? (both laughing) - No, I wished-- - La, la, la, don't say that, Tyler. That one's for you, darling. - You know what? There's a cute guy underneath all that hair. And I just caught a glimpse of him again. - Bridgett, please. Don't go being nice, you're gonna ruin our little thing. (smacking) - [Bridgett] The glimpse is gone. - That's more like it, thank you. So Tyler, did your dad tell you the news? - No, what news? - He met someone. - Miles, nothing, it's nothing. - He has a new friend. - [Jerry] Knock it off, Miles. - He met a girl. (slapping) - Outside right now. What is your problem? - You just went nuts on me. - That is my baby in there. Alright, everything else is fair game but you leave her alone. - What did I do? - Her mother died, Miles. - Yeah, she did, Jerry. She died three years ago. - And you don't have the right. - Jerry, I'm your best friend. - Miles, just, just go home, all right? Just go home. - Jerry. See you tomorrow? - [Tyler] Okay, Dad, who is she? - Well, her name is Sam. She just moved to town. You know, I've only talked with her a couple times. So I guess I don't even really know her yet. - Well, I would like to meet her. - Yeah, really? - Yeah, Dad. If she's new in town, I bet she would like some friends to show her around. Hey, I win again! - You weigh less than me so it's not even a fair race. - Can I have a quarter? (panting) - Well, I guess she's just gonna find us. - What does she look like? I'll find her fast. - Yeah, very funny. - [Sam] Jerry! - [Jerry] Sam, hi. - Hi. - Good to see you. - You, too. - Please meet my daughter, Tyler. Tyler, Sam. Sam, Tyler. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too. - I'm sorry I'm out of breath. She beat me in a race. - You crushed him, didn't you? - Yep. - It wasn't even pretty. I'm glad you could meet us. - Of course. I had to cancel all my other plans but. - Well, I hope the queen could reschedule. - I just told her I'd call her back. (laughs) - Sam, come here, I want to show you. See that? That's the harbor and over there, those are the Channel Islands. But you have to be careful because, you know, the sharks. - The sharks? - Yeah, but they don't harm you at all. - Well it looks like I found my tour guide. - You haven't seen anything yet. Come on, I'll show you.

I mean, besides my good looks and hulking build, of course. (laughs) - I think you're cute. Don't you ever just get a hunch about someone? - Be careful about that hunch. Tyler and I are actually escaped convicts. Armed and dangerous. (laughing) - So what happened with Tyler's mother? Is it okay that I ask? - Yeah, of course. She passed away three years ago, from breast cancer. - Oh, I'm so sorry. - Thanks. Yeah, I mean to be honest, I don't really date. I really haven't had a woman around. You're the first. No pressure or anything. Way to seal the deal on the first date, huh? Nice meeting you. - Sit down. - Help! That's seagull's gonna bite me. - Well, bite it back. - Nah. - Hey guys, come on, the tour's not over yet. Let's go, come on. ♪ Sail, sail away with me ♪ We'll leave our luxuries ♪ Throw them to the sea ♪ And you and me ♪ We can weather the storm - And no matter how hard I tried, it, it didn't matter, I was it was... I just wanted to be good enough, you know? Basically what I'm getting at is, I think that my dad was right because I haven't really amounted to anything. - Miles. I mean you're smart, you're talented and we love you. - I love you, man. You're a beautiful, like a really beautiful guy. Seriously beautiful. - Okay, that's what the pain hole here is all about. Miles, everybody wants to be a hero, but they're not. There's not enough room for everybody to be a hero. There's more room for people to be failures. To be disappointed. Everyone feels that. The person you look up to most, failure. But they can channel all that failure in a calm, level headed way. Who's to say that's not a success? (fire crackling) (sighs) (door opening) - Miles? - [Miles] Hey, Jerry. - How'd you get in here? - I made a key. - It's 2 o'clock in the morning, you just broke into my house. - [Miles] I know. - Are you drunk? - Me? No. - Sit down. - You were right, Jerry. We can't win. I'm a loser. I'm sorry for dragging you into this, Jerry. - You're not a loser, Miles. You're a great guy. You're my best friend. So whatever's going on in that head of yours, you sleep it off, okay? You're not going anywhere. By the way, I spent the day with Sam. - Well, I will have to process this one tomorrow. Do you like her? - Yeah, I do. - Well, good, congratulations. Now I won't have to hit on her. - Thanks. Get some sleep. - [Miles] Goodnight, Jerry. - [Jerry] Goodnight. (breathing heavy) - Wake up. - [Jerry] Tyler's still sleeping. - [Miles] I think I'll join ya. (groaning) - Strange. (lively rock music) (ball pinging) - Come on, baby, bring it to daddy. Atta boy, atta boy. Yes! All right! Yes! That's nice. Hey, call me crazy, but I think we're ready. Saturday morning first round? What's your gut? - I don't know, I guess we'll do our best, right? I mean, we beat some of those guys before. But it's this Goliath brothers I don't know what to do with. I guess we could stick slings in our pocket or something. - Sling? - That's what you got! (both laughing) Woo hoo! - Hey, nice match. - [Opponent] Good match, guys. - Congratulations, gentlemen. - [Opponent] What do you mean, we lost. - Yeah, I'm congratulating you because you just became the first members of the 'we got ours handed to us by the Gollant brothers' club. Hey! - Hey, I almost forgot, it's a black roadster 550SL parked right next to your Toyota, you can't miss it. - [Opponent] Snap! - Oh, and don't forget, hand wax, no machines. Come on, you tall drink of water. - Come on, you handsome devil you. - I need a Shirley Temple. - No machines. - The funny thing is, is I actually cook by numbers. - We should have eaten upstairs, dad. - Nah, it's a little chilly out. - I don't remember an upstairs on the tour. - Oh, well it's our special little place we like to call it roof. It's our penthouse suite. - Sounds fun. - [Tyler] Did Dad tell you about the tournament? - No, what tournament? - I play tennis. I have a doubles partner, it's really not a big deal. - Yes, it is. We're going to the open. - Tyler. - Wow! You're a professional tennis player. I did not see that coming. - Yeah, funny. No, there's this round robin that my friend Miles convinced me to play in, against every fiber in my body. - Why? It sounds fun. Is he good? - Yes, but uncle Miles is a little, you know, crazy. - But, we're never gonna win. - Not with that attitude. - You sound like you've been hanging out with Miles. - Seriously, you can't rule yourself out of the contest before it starts. - It's a tournament, not a contest. - Whatever. Can I come? - [Tyler] Yeah. - Oh, we'll be your fan club, Tyler and I. We'll get pom poms, and paint our faces, and we'll make some signs. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, wow, look at the time. Tyler. - Dad, that's not fair. Bring the pom poms. - Okay. - Hey, there's no pom poms in tennis. - Good night, Tyler. - [Tyler] Goodnight. - She's so excited for you. You're a lucky guy. - Yeah, I know. She's still just full of so much hope. - Have you lost yours? - Let's just say I'm a realist. You know, less expectation, less disappointment. - Well, that's depressing. (Jerry laughs) You can't lose hope, Jerry. - You know, that's what she keeps telling me. - Good, she's a smart girl. - I gotta go tuck her in, so I'll be right back. - Okay. (grunting) - [Jerry] Gosh, I'm gonna beat you one of these days. - No, you're not. - [Jerry] Goodnight, sweetie. - Goodnight. - So you gonna show me that penthouse suite or what? - If I could have your attention, I would like to introduce Jim. We had a good long conversation, he's gonna be joining us. I'd like you to welcome him as a member of the family. Have a seat. - [All] Hi, Jim. - Hi. I, um, appreciate you having me. I struggle with acceptance, so I already feel like I'm part of the family here, so thank you. - You know this is not abandonment resolution. This is a serious class for stress management. - I understand. I, if you'd let me speak, I think maybe this would help me out a lot. - This is ridiculous. He's another poacher. I have serious issues. I'm about to play in a major tournament, and now we have Puss in Boots eating up our precious time. - Hey! (smacking) - Jim, it's all right, you keep going. - Thanks. So I have some real resentment, anger boiling in my blood toward my bosses. They're not nice people. Sometimes I just feel like I could snap! - Yeah, yeah! - Or maybe I'll just quit, I don't know. Or I could just slip a little something in their sports drinks, knock them off. - Oh, no, that's not, shouldn't you report that to the authorities? - What happens in the pain hole-- - [All] Stays in the pain hole. - You're okay here. (guitar riffing) - Oh, wow, this is amazing. - It's not bad, right? It makes the small place worth it. - I'm so glad I moved here. I had no idea what I was doing, I just pointed my finger at the map and this is where it landed. - Really? - Yeah. - So why did you leave New York anyway? - I just needed a fresh start. Take a risk, new adventure. Life's short, you gotta rock it! (chuckles) - Rock it? Okay. - You know, change. The ocean, mountains, fresh air. I just needed to slow down. - Yeah, I need to tell you something. I'm not really good at this. Thanks. You know, I was just thinking about what you said today, how you are with Tyler. I know it's-- (romantic music) Wow. Can we try that again? That was a little-- (giggling) - This is Jet Johnson. We're here at the Bay View Tennis Club getting ready for the club's 26th annual round robin tournament, but this year is special with winner's getting the shot and we will be here live. - Hey, that's Jet Johnson, bro. - Back to you in the studio. (fast rock music) - Excuse us. Round one, court seven. - I cannot believe you wore that shirt. - Intimidation, bro, show the guns, baby. - Let's just go sign in. - Hey, at least I wore my country club shorts. - Oh, and you know what? This cannot leave the table. This has to stay here the pretty much all the time. - Hello. Miles Worth, Jerry McDonald reporting for duty. - Worth and McDonald. - You've heard of us? - Of course. Here, go ahead and take this form, fill it out, sign it, one per team. - How are you today? - Great. You? - Fantastic. - Good. - Hey, this isn't your right number. - Hey, shh. Don't give the right number, that's how they track you. Oh, no, thank you, we don't want to buy anything. - [Girl] This is complimentary. - For registering. - Oh, for like top seeds and stuff. - I'm sorry, he doesn't get out much. - [Woman] Clearly. - All right, let's go, Jerry. Thank you, ladies. - Sure, have fun. - Thanks. (fast rock music) (ball pinging) - Who the heck is that? - That's my daughter and my girlfriend, please. - [Man] Out! - Take it easy! Girlfriend? Dude-- - What? We haven't spoken in a while. - Unbelievable. (fast rock music) Oh, excuse me. - Yes! (squealing and cheering) - [Jerry] Nice match. - Pleasure. - Round one. - Done. Let's do this, baby, round two. - You guys did great! - Hey, congrats. - [Miles] You see that, kid? - Sam, this is the infamous Miles. - Hey, nice to meet you, Miles. - [Miles] Hello. - Great game. - It's a match. - Match, sorry. - So let's go take a load off, huh? - Yeah, let's do it. - [Miles] Like her? - Yeah, she's awesome. - Let's do this. - Come on. (fast rock music) (ball pinging) - Long. - Long? I'll give you long. - It was long, sorry. - That was in! - Hey, chill. - I'll see you later, okay. - You breathe, breathe. - After the match. - Breathe, you need a time out. - I'm fine. Yeah! (cheering) Yes! Yes! (cheering) (whooping) - Uh, no! - You gotta be quicker, come on, you know that. - [Bridgette] Hey, guys. - [Jerry] Bridgette. - Yeah. - This is Sam. Sam, Bridge. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. (giggles) - So how did you two meet? - We work together. - And he lost a bet and had to take me out for burgers. - I like her, she's beautiful. - Thank you. - And you found the best man in town, hands down. - Okay. - Are we done yet? - And then there's Miles. - Well, I would like to make a toast. - I'm going to borrow this. - First to my family. I love you guys, you guys mean everything to me, and B, to my new friend Sam, usually friends of Jerry's are not friends of mine, but you are very, very pleasant and beautiful. And I just want to say that if it doesn't work out with Jerry, then maybe me and you can go out sometime. - Enough, enough, enough. - C, to the dynamic duo of Worth and McDonald for kicking some serious arsenova today. - Good job, boys! (glasses clinking) - Here's to arsenova! I'm off tomorrow, so I will be there to represent. - All right. - [Bridgette] Yeah! - Uh! (chuckles) - How are we going to get to the open? I say road trip. - Sounds great to me. - Yes! - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't get ahead of ourselves, Jerry. We have a very big day tomorrow. Did I just say that? I just said that? It's like I'm becoming the voice of reason or something. - You know, I didn't really see our game clicking like it is. I mean, if we play like we did today, I think we have a serious shot. - Well, I'm no expert, but I thought you guys looked great out there, synchronicity. - I don't know what The Police have to do with it, but we'll take that compliment. Ba! - Dad, you're the best. I know you're going to win. - You know what? If we win, you get the trophy. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, what? - You can have one of the winning balls. - I get the game ball. - I get the trophy. - I get the game ball. - I get the trophy. - I get the game ball. - Trophy. - Who's the adult here? - I don't know, it's not him. It's not him. - Oooh! (romantic music) - Thanks for coming out today. - I had a great time, loved it. - Yeah, you know, I kind of like having you around. You make me feel, good. - Watch out, you're going to get into trouble. - Really? Can I take a rain check on that? I mean, seriously, you got a pen? - Go home and get some sleep. You have a big tournament to win tomorrow. - Okay, you have a good night. - You do the same.

My heart stopped! - [Sam] Yay! (all chattering) That was awesome, nice job. - [Jerry] You were a wild man. - [Miles] You rallied, you rallied, you brought it. - I'm going to put this in the front window. - That sounds like a perfect spot, honey. - Speaking of which. - [Jerry] He's fast. - Are you Jerry McDonald and Miles Worth? - Yeah. You guys know each other? - No, who's asking? - Me, I'm Jim, that's me, I work for the Gollant bro--, Gollant brothers. You guys ready for the tournament? - Yeah, we are.

(laughing) - Well, I'll tell you what, my brother and I are going to go meet some friends. Why don't you go out there and hit a few balls around and see if you can't get ready for us. That's the court. - With the net in the middle. - Absolutely. Oh, by the way, they're having a huge sale at the buy one, get one free store. You guys should check it out. (laughing) - Nice one, like we need extra time to hit. - Jerk. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. Excuse me, but this is our bench. - [Miles] What, do you own it? - (laughs) As a matter of fact, we do, so come on, move off, go, go. - In fact, what you guys can have are these two plastic chairs. - [Rob] Go on. - [Tim] Thank you. - [Rob] There you go. - Oh, he's having a temper tantrum. - Somebody's angry. - [Miles] What did you say? - It's not worth it. - He said you were having a temper tantrum! - I said you were having a temper tantrum. (chuckles) - [Jim] He said you were having a temper tantrum. - Hey, hey, hey. - There's no need to repeat. - Center court, coin toss. Let's go. - [Miles] Come on, baby. - Worth, McDonald. Gollant, Gollant. Please shake hands. Gollant brothers are the reigning champions of the club, so they get the coin toss. Call it. - Tails! Come on, baby. - Yes! - Heads. - We'll take serve. - We'll take that side. - Yeah. - Let's do it, baby, let's do it. - They had to win something. - How you feeling? - Good. I got serve. I got this. - Let's do this. (fast rock music) (ball pinging) (laughing) - Advantage, Gollant, Gollant, advantage, Gollant brothers. Set point. Set one, Gollants. - We're playing well, right? - Yeah, one point at a time. This, this set is ours. (crowd cheers) - Advantage, Worth, McDonald. Set point. Set two, Worth, McDonald. (laughing) - I'm going to pee in my pants. - Yeah, baby, yeah! You're welcome. - Excuse me? - This is your first time going three sets. You're welcome. - Get off, go, go, go, go. Whew! - Ugh. - What do you say we end these clowns, huh? - Let's do it. (gargling) - We can't lose now. We cannot lose. - We won't, no way. - Okay. (suspenseful music) - I'm so proud of my dad. (cheers and clapping) - Gentlemen, match point. Match point. (ball bouncing) (heart beating) - Fault. Second serve. (exhales) (melancholy music) - This would be ours. (laughing) Check it, big bro. Nice, huh? - [Rob] Seven. - That was a tough match, but you handled yourself well. I am so proud of you. Have you ever thought of golf? - You did great, Dad. - Jerry, you've got to let this go, you look terrible. - [Jerry] Sorry. - Don't be sorry, it's just a game. - It wasn't just a game, Sam. You wouldn't understand. - Tell me, what is there to understand? You played, you lost. That's life. I was really proud of what you did today, so was Tyler. - Was she? Were you? Be honest. - Jerry, why is-- - Sam, this isn't me. I mean, I'm not an athlete. I don't have money. I'm not successful, at anything. I look at you. I look at me, this is too good to be true. This isn't going to work out. - This isn't just about losing today, is it? Miles loves you, Jerry. You're Tyler's hero, and I really like what we've started here. This. People love you, Jerry, whether you win or lose. Why won't you let them? - Because I don't deserve it.

Jerry, we lost a tennis match. It was our best tennis ever, we've never played so good. There's something to be said for that. - Yeah, but when it matters, when it really matters, I choke. I killed your dream. I broke Tyler's faith in her dad. And I proved my point to Sam. I'm the loser. I always have been. Every time I try something, I fail. (car door closing) - I know what this is about, Jerry. I've known for a long time, and I'm finally going to say it. I've been scared to say it, but I'm going to say it because I love you like a brother, and if you don't want to see me again, I'll take that chance, but I hope you hear what I say. Jerry, you're not responsible for Linda's death. - You son of a bi-- - It's not your fault that all of your efforts and all of the doctors and all of the specialists and all of these special medicines and all of your prayers didn't save her. You're a great man. You're a great father. You're a great friend. You were a great husband. But you can't control everything. And sometimes life sucks and really bad things happen, really bad things like cancer, but somehow life goes on, and you must go on. (melancholy music) - You want to eat upstairs? - [Jerry] Nah. - I got an A on my report. - [Jerry] Well, that's great, honey. So your teacher liked your take on Charlotte? - She liked my conclusion. - Which was? - Well, the story is about Charlotte being a miracle spider who saves Wilbur the pig, right? - Right. - At the end Charlotte dies and Wilbur is very sad. Everyone thinks that Charlotte's the hero, but I think Wilbur is the real hero. He never gave up, even when he lost his best friend. - You're right, that Wilbur was a really tough pig. - Yep, that's why he's my hero. - You are amazing. I give you an A plus. How about some hot chocolate and a sunset? - You know what I've been thinking. - What's that? - Mom is just like the sun. She traveled around the world shining light on all of us, and now she's in heaven living with God. And one day, one day we'll see her again. See? I told you. - Just a second, honey, I'll be right there. Thank you. (hopeful music) ♪ Let your guard down - Gavin asked me to the dance. - What? Well, that's great, Ty. - I said no. I want to go to the dance but-- - Well, school dances are fun. I mean, you get to hang out with your friends. You get to get all dressed up. - I know, but then you'll be all alone. - Why would you be worried about that? Don't answer that. (sighs) Tyler, you don't ever have to worry about your dad, and I'm sorry that I ever made you feel like that. - Dad, what happened to Sam? - Nothing, she's fine. - Dad. - Sometimes I do dumb things. I'm far from perfect, and I've been acting, I guess, like a baby, and I'm sorry. Now, I know it's your decision, but if I were you I would go to that dance with Gavin. - You think? What will I wear? - Let's go shopping. - Okay! - Hey, say a prayer for your old man, huh? I love you. (jazz music) Miles, where are you? - Woo hoo! (tires screeching) What happened? - Oh, um, Mr. Worth, Mr. McDonald. Look, I've been trying to call you for the last two days. I must have the wrong phone number. Anyway, I'm sure you guys have probably heard about Mr. Gollant by now. - Yes, ma'am, our condolences. - Yeah, anyway, so what happens with the wild card? - Hold on. It says here that the runners up are given first right of refusal in the event the tournament winners are unable to attend and compete. You two are the runners up. - Well, when is the exhibition match? - September 9th. - That's in like-- - That's like three days. - Yes. So, what are you guys gonna do? (lively rock music) (knocking) - Sam? Hey, Sam, it's Jerry. Give me a call when you get the message, okay? Thanks. (phone chiming) - Dude, she's in! - Road trip! - [Jerry] All right! - You talk to Sam? - No, she wasn't home. - I'm sorry, man. - [Jerry] Yeah, you know. - Well, we should probably hit the road because, you know, it's a long drive. - Yeah, it's a long drive.

Sorry, Sam, we almost crashed, but we're okay now. I miss you! - Sam, I really need to talk to you, where are you? - Um, okay, I'm just driving home from work. Can we-- - I'll be there in a minute. - Yeah! - Jerry, hello? (hopeful music) - Sam, Sam? I know how this must look, and I know I'm probably acting crazy, but I gotta tell you something, okay? I'm sorry. Look, I've been acting like a jerk. I've been feeling sorry for myself for way too long. Actually, I haven't even been living at all. But, I see that now. You taught me that. I guess what I'm trying to say is I really hope that I haven't lost you. - Well, you did.
