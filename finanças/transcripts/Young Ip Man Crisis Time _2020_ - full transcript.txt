The point is to attack, find the shortest route to strike the arm. Spread hands to show your wings, press down your hands and attack. First, hide your true target. Second, not chasing after victory. Third, do not afraid of the enemy. Looking for an opponent, humbly ask the teacher. No teacher nor opponent, find it in the mirror and plum blossom pile. Ip Man, this is the magic of Wing Chun.

Go! - Stop, get him! - Jack. - What happened? - Young master. It's dangerous, you need to get out of here. - But... - Don't ask any more questions. I'll explain it to you later. Listen to me, run. Yu xue-hu! With the roar of guns, the biggest kidnapping case in Hong Kong this year has arrived again as promised. Hello, everyone. I'm Ma Long. Ma Long? It's the wanted man, Ma Long. I am very happy to inform you that your children have been kidnapped. Some people exchange their lives for money, while some people exchange their money for lives. I belong to those who trade lives for money. I hope all parents here belong to those exchange money for the lives. Look, up there! Help! Look, that's our lady. Please calm down! Sheriff Zhou, do something! I just have one girl. Within two hours, each student needs five gold bars. Five gold bars? I hope all the parents here will keep their appointment and don't play tricks with me. The countdown begins now. Don't be too smart. Be a man, just like playing chess. One can only doing right if they can tell right from wrong. You can only be dignified if you can tell wrong from right. A man should be upright. Dad, what do you mean? Why can't Bai Lu understand? What I means is that no matter what is right or wrong, don't change your mind because of the circumstances. Man, do you understand? Sir, I'll follow your instructions carefully. News! A felon escaped from prison, who is wanted in the city! Thank you, sir. - Sir? - Mr Ma long. This is Sheriff Zhou, could you let me come in and have an interview with you? Sheriff Zhou, you are not qualified. I heard that Commissioner Stewart wants to see me very much, and the whole city is frantically looking for me. Then, I will give him a chance to come and talk to me in person with gold bars. At the same time, I will prepare a surprise for him. I repeat. Within two hours, you must bring me both gold bars and the commissioner. Otherwise, every one minute after that, I will kill a child. Without confirming the safety of the children, the parents of the students will not hand over the gold and the commissioner will not come here too. Fine, I'll give you a chance. Listen to me, hurry up and prepare the gold now. I'll go up and have a look at the safety of the children. As well as to buy you some time in advance. - Gold, get gold right away! - Hurry up! Stop. Go. Do not be greedy for victory, whenever entering the battlefield shouldn't be in a rough rush. Attack the enemy as well as watch out of one self, abandon for what with lower priority as to make an advance move. Do not be greedy for victory, whenever entering the battlefield shouldn't be in a rough rush. Attack the enemy as well as watch out of one self, abandon for what with lower priority as to make an advance move. Just give up the small and seek for the big, willing to abandon any actions which is not worthing the risk. Just give up the small and seek for the big, willing to abandon any actions which is not worthing the risk. Let him in. Don't make any rough move in a rush, only respond when it is appropriate. Protect ourselves is first priority while the enemy is so strong to you, negotiating for the peace whenever you are so weak to go against. Sir. Sir? It's been a long time since no one called me that. Man. Long time no see. Long time no see. Didn't expect that after separating from the Bailu Chess Academy, we would turn out to meet again in such circumstances. Neither can I imagine that after all these years, Mr Ma would have changed like this. Changed? Have I changed? In my impression, although you don't laugh much, but always be kind to us. You laughed just now, but I just think... Ugly. Yes. You have changed too. We both have changed. So you have to understand and clarify the situation. But, sir. What you did today is wrong. Wrong? What is wrong? And what is right? Does anyone have the final say? The strong only ask if they win or lose, only the weak and incompetent distinguish right from wrong. Sir, that's not what you taught me before. You always taught me that one must distinguish between black and white. - You said that... - Enough. Don't tell me anything about the past from now on. I'm not the teacher I used to be. I'm the kidnapper Ma Long. So you don't play chess anymore, right? As a man, there is more than the success or failure within that square inch. Now, the whole of Hong Kong is my chessboard. Only because you are not satisfied with the square inch of Foshan, so you come to Hong Kong, right? I came to Hong Kong to learn more knowledge and know more about right and wrong. Since you respect me as always, I won't be difficult for you. You can go now. I'm not leaving. This is my school, there are my classmates here. I can't leave them alone, and I will definitely stop your actions. How can you stop me? I have learned to play chess with you since I was a child. Today, I will take the school as the chessboard and play against you again. All right, what do you want to do? For a quarter of an hour, we will see how have I overthrown your plan by my own self. Fine, this quarter of an hour is all yours. I will take it as you win if you can stand up and go out then, and I'll let all these students go. But I am telling you, Ip Man. The chess field is just like a battlefield. Once entering the game, you and I will be the enemies. You've made up your mind. Making any decision with no regrets, life and death are always being destined. - Don't let him last that long. - Yes, boss. Ip Man. Open it, open the door. Ip Man! Yu Xue-hu, do you know what you are doing? Ip Man. I let you go again and again, why don't you go? You are kidnapping! So what? All I know is that I earn enough for a lifetime by dong this today. Are you crazy? Are you taking other people's lives to make money? Are you a little human? I am insane! Since childhood, none of you think highly of me. I thought that as long as I was good at kung fu, I could have a world with my own fist. But in the end? I couldn't even marry my beloved Xiao-feng. Her family looked down on me who didn't like me at all! I was like an unwanted dog. Why were you born a young master? Why was I just a poor servant? I finally had a chance to turn over, but you stop me again and again! Why? Why? Because I have always regarded you as a brother. You do treat me like a brother, but you don't understand me at all. Xue-hu, you can always earn money again whenever you need them, but it is very hard to turn back if you take the wrong step now. Do you know? I don't need you to care! Yu Xue-hu, what are you waiting for? Do it! Yu Xue-hu, did you forget what Mr Long told you? Yu Xue-hu, do you still want money? Xiao-feng. Do you make money to marry Xiao-feng? Yes, Mr Long. Your share of my money is enough for Xiao-feng and me to spend the rest of our lives. So whatever you want me to do, I, Yu Xue-hu, will devote myself till my death. What if Ip Man gets in the way? Money or Brother? Do it! Yu Xue-hu, feelings are just worthless in this world. Do it! Come on! Mr Long knew it, you were just unreliable. Xue-hu? Ip Man, I saved you to repay the kindness of the Ip family to me. From then on, we owe each other nothing. Ip Man, there is a secret passage in the North Zone. Leave here early, I won't be merciful next time I see you. Help! Stop! Help! - Stop! - Help! - Help! - Stop! - Zhou, help me! - What is it? Someone is kidnapping me! - Young master? - Zhou, help! Young master! - Who's that? - Zhou. Where're they, young master? Take me out of here! - My dad will give you a promotion! - No... What do you want? - Where's your gun, Zhou? - No, I have not bring it with me. - How can you don't have a gun! - I really don't have it with me. Come out. Zhou? Zhou! Don't move! Don't move you all! Come on up there! Sheriff Zhou, that's more like it. Ma Long, what do you want to do? Since you cooperate with me, we are one side. You have to do something to show me your sincerity, right? You said you wanted to talk to me, so go on. We just agreed that each student only needs one gold bar, yet you suddenly change your mind and wanting five gold bars instead. Where are they going to find them for you? It's all for you, okay? Once we kill Stewart, aren't you the commissioner then? I'm going to prepare a big gift for you. Forget about the gift, I only want the post of commissioner. However, I don't do it if there is anything against law. I don't dare to do it. You don't dare to? You dared to let go of Ma Long at the very beginning, what else dare you not? You have to figure out whether you are a policeman or a bandit. Of course I'm a bandit. But there are rules for bandits too, let's just do what we just agreed. We will work in cooperate, you want money and I want power. If something goes wrong, I can't protect you then even if I become the commissioner. Protect me? Sheriff Zhou, do you think you can still be of use to me? Time is running out. Okay... I'll send you the commissioner and the gold bar right now. Ya-yun? Ip Man. Come here. Are you all right? - I'm okay. - That's fine. There's a secret passage in the North Zone. Get out right now. What about you? I tried to save my classmates. Wait, I have an idea. - There is Sheriff Zhou. - Sheriff Zhou's back... Sheriff Zhou... - How's going on? - How's it going, Sheriff Zhou? - Calm down... - Sheriff Zhou. Sheriff Zhou, I took 50 gold bars. Don't worry, everyone. The kids are safe. They also said that the hostages will be released as long as the gold is delivered. Great! Where did the smoke come from? - Go and check. - Got it. I will lead them away, you go save them. Ip Man's here! Hurry! That way! Move! I'm here to save everyone. Alright, you help him. Does Leng Yu's death have anything to do with you? It has nothing to do with me. Do you believe I will kill you? Ma Wei. I'm sorry, everyone. I have to change the rules of the game. My son! How dare you, murderer! Someone killed a best friend of mine, and his name is Ip Man. Ip Man, I'll give a tooth for a tooth, that makes sense, right? Here, go. Fate abandons me, and I'd rather become a demon. I'll give you one more minute. If the commissioner has not been here in a minute, who can just wait for collecting the body of his son. The countdown begins. Soldiers, hurry up and get the commissioner here. - Go! - Yes, sir. Mr Ma Long! The commissioner will be here soon, please don't fool around. Stop! Hurry! Almost done. All right, hurry up. I'll do it. Hurry up! There! Besiege him! Hurry up! Help! Pull me up! - Hurry up! - Help... - Done! - Hanks! Ip Man, be careful. Everyone, go! - Don't move! - Don't try anything fancy! 10. Mr Ma Long! 9. Calm down. 8. 7. 6. 5. 4. Please save the children! 3. 2. The commissioner is here! The commissioner is here! Commissioner! Commissioner, please save the children! Mr Stewart, welcome. I asked you to catch Ma long, yet Jack got caught by them instead. - You did a good job Zhou. - Commissioner... I'm telling you, I'll kill you if Jack has any wound. Yes, sir. - Give that to me. - Yes, here you are... Gold, I brought it. Let my son go. Mr Stewart, I miss you so much. Do you know that? I have missed you every day for the past eight years! What do you want? What am I going to do? What do I want? Do you remember her? My daughter has been framed to death and the evidence is conclusive, , why not file a case for arrest? Ten taels of silver for your daughter's life, fair? Are you okay with this? Commissioner... You are a smart man. You said you used it to buy my daughter's life. Today, I want to ask you in return, how much can I buy your son's life? You don't understand the situation at that time. The people who killed your daughter have power and status, I can't fight them. I just can't fight them, but I still want to help you! That's enough. I have lived through hardships for eight years, just to wait for this day to buy your son's life with money. My son's life is not for sale! Then, why did you buy my daughter's life with ten taels of silver? Why? Is it enough? Is it enough? I'll give it all to you, is it enough to buy your son's life? Not for sale! I don't want the life of the whole school, but I must buy your son's life. Jack! Sir! I have survived a quarter of an hour in accordance with the regulations you have to abide by our agreement to release my classmate! Sir! Ma Long. I feel pity for you, and I want to help too. This money is yours. I will let my people withdraw, also revoke my wanted on you too. You can leave Hong Kong safely. You can go now. I know that I can go. Mr Stewart, you're going in the wrong direction. Commissionar! Alert! Ma Long! Why don't you obey the rules of the game? Ip Man, don't forget that I am the executor of this game. I set the rules, but you broke my rules. About Leng Yu's death, you have to give me an explanation. How about this? I'll give you another chance, do you dare to bet on the last game with me? Sure. I will stay with you to the end. Yu Xue-hu, you said that Leng Yu's death has nothing to do with you. So, it's time to prove you. The rules of the game are very simple. Five minutes' time, a showdown of life or death. Ip Man. If you overthrow Yu Xue-hu, you take these students away. If Yu Xue-hu defeats you, and I take away the lives of these students. Yu Xue-hu. If you win, I can pay you double the price. Yu Xue-hu, is it worth the money? Ip Man, you still don't understand me. Let the game begin. Ip Man. If you don't fight back, I'll shoot him in the head with the next shot. Ip Man. To practice Wing Chun well, you have to work hard from your beginning. If the beginning is not right, the later life will be not right. Xue-hu. Actually, being a man is the same as practicing martial arts. If the beginning is not right, the later life will be not right. Don't move. No matter how rich you are, you will eventually be a criminal kidnapping students. Stop it! Ip Man. Ip Man. You lost. Mr Long. I don't want the money now, please let them go. Shut up, what make you have the say to intercede for them? You are just a pawn of me, you idiot. Ip Man. Since you once called me teacher, I'll teach you one last trick. Since ancient times, there have been many losers with mercy, but only the cold-blooded soldiers who succeeded for hundreds of times. Your softness has ruined the lives of these students. Stop it. Squat down, don't move! Mr Long, give me five more minutes. Don't move! Don't move! Guys, fight with them! Wei! Ip Man, are you all right? Ip Man. - Ip Man? - Ya-yun, time is running out. Xue-hu, get the students out of here! Go! Hurry up, let's go. Ya-yun. Ya-yun! - Did you see Ya-yun? - No! Go guard the secret passages. Ya-yun! Ya-yun! - Did you see my Ya-yun? - I don't know. Ya-yun! - Ya-yun! - Daddy? Alright, see you tomorrow. Okay. Thank you, sir. Hurry. Zhou, what do you want to do? Of course the police caught the thief. Sheriff Zhou wants to cross the river and tear down the bridge? Kidnapper Ma Long escaped from prison, then planned with illegal gang in executing the kidnapping case of the Hong Kong Tak Lap Academy, whose extortion have been causing public disorder, and killing a large number of innocent students too. This is a heinous crime, the kidnapper Ma Long is now arrested in accordance with the law. Zhou, are you a policeman or a bandit? Nonsense. Of course the police caught the thief. Unfortunately, I was almost turned into a bandit because of you. What to do if the police who knows the law but still breaking it? Take him away! Wait a minute. Please wait a minute. Come in. Sheriff Zhou could you give me some time? I'd like to say goodbye to my teacher. Sir, I really do not understand. Why have you become like this? I once thought I was the executor of this game, but it was only later that I realized... I was just a line or joint on the chessboard for someone else to trample on unwillingly. However, aren't we supposed to be people who change the environment? Sir, you should not forget your original intention. Our original intention? Sir. I wish it was all a dream, and we can start it all over again. Start over? No, we can't. Life. Is just like a chess game. Making any decision with no regrets. Sir! Sir... Go, hurry up. Hurry. Xue-hu. Young master. Take care. Yu Xue-hu!! Young people always make mistakes, just fix it will be fine then. Open the door. Just fix it will be fine. Ip Man. Did you choke when eating bread in the morning? No, I am fine. That's good... Alas, it would be even better if you don't have a girlfriend. Well, I'll sit in the front. Let's go. "Hong Kong Tak Lap Adcademy" "Ignore all those barriers up front, I still got my dream in the heart" "Special thanks for" "Class reunion of the Wing Chun Ip Chun Academy" "in addition to Leung Chung-wai, Ip Kong-chiu," "Lam Chung and Lin Sang" "What I have been through make me absolutely unrivaled" "I am looking forward to the glorious future after the rebirth"
