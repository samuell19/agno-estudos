A Toei Presentation Book Presentation: Young Generation What we call the three evils... prostitution, sexual diseases and drugs... not only are a plague for human kind but... they will lead to the destruction of this country and the world. In my book Young Generation, now published... I offer solutions to deal with these evils. Consider it my humble contribution. I hope that many will support and help me. Thank you all for coming today. Tsusai-Sensei. - Congratulations. - Hello, Mr. Tsujima. I'm honored... that you came today. In fact... Mr. Kamiyama wants to honor you on this occasion. Congratulations. To celebrate this day... I called an Okinawan dancer. I thought it would be perfect since you just went to Okinawa. I hope you enjoy the show. Hello? Ah, 'Papa'? What are you doing? I'm waiting. Ah. You can't come? You keep postponing... I hate that. Ah. Come tomorrow, then. You have to come. Tamagaki Shizuko fell from her balcony on the 5th floor Narcotics Bureau Kanto Shinetsu District Good morning. You called for me? Oh, Sensei. Hey, Kikuchi, it's been a while. Hello, good to meet you again. - Hey... - Hm? Have you heard about the Tamagaki Shizuko case? Yeah, it was in the papers. That woman was high on heroin. Eh? We found some in her room too. Then why, boss? We're under pressure from above. We have to push the investigation. You see, it reminds me of the Kyouzan case. Sensei would like you to go to Okinawa... to investigate this case. What do you think? This is a dangerous job. All my jobs are dangerous. I'll go.

I heard about your grand-daughter, Shizuko. My name is Kikuchi, I came from Tokyo. The truth is... I wanted to hold a memorial for Shizuko. And so... I'd like to meet someone who was close to her. Yamatonchu... go back... come from. What? My Shizuko didn't need... Yamatonchu... ...away to Tokyo. Yamatonchu ... killed her... What are you...? Why... come... Yamatonchu? You ... cheating... My Shizuko... betrayed by Yamatonchu... Yamatonchu ... killed her... Sorry but... I don't understand the dialect. She said, Shizuko was betrayed by a mainlander, and killed. And you are? I'm Tamagaki Mitsuko. Ah. So you're Shizuko's... Yes, I'm her younger sister. Shizuko was always in Tokyo. She forgot about Okinawa. Shizuko hated Okinawa. Why? We weren't rich enough, I guess. And what about your other sister? She's in Koza. She's a hostess in a nightclub. She hates Okinawa too. She wants to go to America. And you, do you hate Okinawa as well? No. I like Okinawa. I think it's the best place in the world. Hey. Wait. You're a Yamatonchu right? What's your business here? I came to meet someone... Listen... In this club, don't touch my sister Sally. Any move, it won't end well for you. What would you do to me? What's wrong, Kunio? Nothing, Sally. Picking a fight with a customer again? Don't stand here. You're bad for business, Kunio. Welcome. You're Mr. Kikuchi, right? Yeah. My sister called. We lost sight of Shizuko in Tokyo. Oh. That's a shame. Welcome. By the way... I heard the Yogi gang owns this club. Yes, the boss is over there. I heard you're interested in Okinawa dancing. Dancing is my hobby. But I'm a travel agent. Great. What? He was killed? Yes. I'll go investigate the Yogi gang. Yogi Real Estateâ€‹ Shinihon Travel Agency, Planning Manager, Mr. Kikuchi. What can we help you with? Our company would like to open a resort in Okinawa. So I came to check out real estate. I'm sorry to say, but our boss just died. So, for a while, we can't do business. I see. It's just that if we could establish a partnership... we'd have great prospects for the future. For business talk, we'll have to postpone to some other time. Excuse me, do you have a light? Thank you. So you found your way easily. Don't look at that. Is he your boyfriend? Yes. It's been 3 years. Maybe he died in Vietnam... Maybe he went back to America. You ignore if he's alive? Right. We were officially married. But he probably won't come back. But still, I keep hoping. The truth is, I'm here to buy narcs. Narcs? You mean narcotics? Yeah. Heroin. The travel agency is only a front. But I'm actually a drug dealer. Sorry about the lie. By the way, do you know someone who uses drugs? No, I don't. There's no one around you who uses? If you could help. Please. Hello. Hello. A client. How about a night together, sir? Kiyoko. You came back here again? Let's go home, let's go home. Let's go home. I'm sorry. My daughter used to work in that club. The Yankees gave her syphilis and she went crazy. Come on. Let's go home. Do you feel sick? I'm fine. Excuse me a minute. What are you doing? I won't hurt you. I want drugs too. Where can I get some? Tell me. Please. I heard I could get some in Okinawa. I came all the way from Tokyo. Come on, please. An American soldier friend supplies me. I heard they sell it at the Black Club. No. Where did he go? What's wrong? Jimmy, where is he? Who's Jimmy? My baby. Your baby? My baby... Where did he go? Hey. Don't mind her, sir. But, the child? He died 2 months ago. - He died? - Yes. He crawled out alone one night and was hit by a car. Damn it. The whites killed Jimmy. A negro child is no more than a dog to them. Yukiko, stop that. Your tears won't bring Jimmy back. And the kid's father? He died. Last year, in Vietnam. What are you doing? Alright. Hey, are you OK? What? It's you. What happened? Damn those guys. They thought I was a black American. But you sure are strong, boss. You showed them. Greenland Hotel Oh. You're up? Boss... Thank you for everything. Where are my clothes? Torn and smeared with blood. I threw them away. You threw them away? Yeah. Where? Don't worry. Take a set from mine. Really? Can I? Sure. Can I have this? Oh, it looks good on you. Boss... I had stuff in my pockets. It's all there. What's that? It's nothing. Aren't these drugs? They are, right? Are you using? No, I don't... Well... It comes from Vietnam, I sell it to the girls. I see. So you're a drug dealer? No, I'm not a dealer. A guy like me can't get a decent job here. I introduce the girls to Yankees and sell them drugs. Boss, it's OK. All the girls here do drugs, so it's OK. Sally. What are you doing here? She said I could earn while having fun here. Idiot. Don't come here! Let's go! Hey, Kunio. Ah, I saw you in that club. Right. Forget about him, let's have fun. Come on. He wants money. 20,000 yen. What's that? An Okinawa special? Sometimes they have the white stuff, but it's expensive. This one's potent too. That's an unusual way to take it. They say it's less dangerous than the syringe. Don't move. Narcotics Police! You're all under arrest. You're all under arrest for narcotics trafficking. Hey. What are you doing in Okinawa? Speak! I'm here on business. Liar! What is your business? I've been telling you... I just followed a guy who promised me girls. You're lying! I know you've been snooping around for drugs. Stop, Shinjo. You're Inspector Kikuchi from Kanto, right? Chief Ishida just called. Too bad for my cover. I'm Kikuchi, nice to meet you. Okinawa is a big drug market. This is the Red Rock the Americans bring in from Vietnam. There's also some from the Philippines. There's also the Pink from Hong Kong. But lately, this pure white stuff is circulating. That's probably what killed Shizuko. Do you think the Yogi gang is involved? No. An underling Yogi dealer... buys all the Red Rock from the Americans... and sells it to the hostesses, that's all. But since their boss was killed... things are going to change. I'm Ito, I was sent from Tokyo. Since your boss died, I'm taking over. I'll be counting on you. Koza Police Station. Boss. Good job. You idiot. You led me into a trap. But I came to pick you up here. I won't forget so easily, you know. I have something to tell you. A drug dealer wants to see you. Hey. Are you sure? Sorry, I'm late. - Did you wait? - No. - Hey. - Hey. You don't need to worry about Mr. Kikuchi. Oh, why not? He's a cop, like me. Oh, really? Let's go to a hotel. I'm hungry. But we haven't met for so long... You prefer a restaurant to a hotel? Shinjo, I hate you. OK, let's have lunch. I brought him. See ya. I don't need to introduce myself. I heard you're looking for drugs. I'll pay the right price for the right goods. But what do you want drugs for? That's a strange question to ask. I guess you're right. But I'd like to see the quality you have? Yes. The next shipment is more than 90% pure. How much do you have? One kilo. One kilo? 100,000,000 yen? That's quite an bundle. Fake money obviously. In case they investigate... I need money in a bank account. OK, I'll see to it. Kikuchi, your mission is getting tough. I'm counting on you. Understood. Come in. Oh, it's you. What do you want at this hour? I have a request. Could you buy me? Why? I want to go to Tokyo but I don't have any money. Tokyo? I'd like to start a new life. If I stay here... I'll go to waste. Tokyo isn't that great either. But no one knows me in Tokyo. Take this. A farewell gift. I don't like handouts. Fuck me. You hate women who do it with blacks? You should value yourself more. I've been observing your operation lately. Frankly, you're not doing well. The only deals that works in Okinawa are land, women and drugs. It should be simple but you can't even manage that. Your don't handle your girls and dealers. You should get more out of them. You're joking. Our girls and dealers are Okinawan people like us. We can't ruthlessly exploit them. You're soft. Listen... Yogi Real Estate is now part of our Mainland Organization. From now on you'll do it the mainland way. We're taking charge of all your assets. Our plan is to unify mainland and Okinawa to create a big tourism resort. First we buy up land. Second, we need girls for the tourists. We need a great number of girls. We'll lend them money and get them addicted to drugs. That'll put a tight leash on them. You dealers... Until now, you just paid a share to Yogi... profiting off the drugs coming from Vietnam. But from now on, we'll take the drugs you get from the Americans. What do you mean? From now on, you will deal for us. In exchange, we'll let you deal drugs from other sources. Then what about our cut? Don't worry. You'll have your cut of the profit. I don't want to. I want to keep being my own boss. Let him know who we are. This is what happens if you don't listen! Be warned! Hey. What are you doing? She tried to run away to Tokyo. You don't have to go that far. It's a warning to the other girls. She'll have it all. Go ahead. We'll starve her and keep the injections going. After a week she won't have the willpower to run. Drive-in Restaurant About that boss... We had a report from Tokyo. And? His name is Ito Onajime. He is on our records in Kansai. He's related to gang violence. But... He doesn't have the influence to do that much in Okinawa. Hey. I heard that you're very close to Shinjo. That probably means there's a big shot behind it. Probably. Anyway, we'll know more later. In the meantime, keep going ahead with the deal. Boss. What happened to you? I'm alright. What do you want? About that deal. I want to meet that man again. Don't get up to anything dangerous. I know. Sorry. Boss... You'd better put the deal off. The new boss can't be trusted. You mean Ito? You know him? They did that to you, right? Not only to me. They also got that girl you know. What? Yukiko? Just drink. Hey, hang on. Mr. Kikuchi. What will you do with her? I'll save her. Why would you do that? You wouldn't understand. Are you in love? I gave her money to flee to Tokyo. I'm not playing heroes... I just want to save her. Come. If you want a fight, let's have it here. I'll let you run. What? You would betray them? It is none of your concern. Now, go. Get in the car and drive. What about you? Just get in. Quickly. It's that car! Higa... You betrayed us! For a woman... Why? Why would I tell a scumbag like you. You betrayed your own people. You'll get it too. You're next. You're being used by the Yamatonchus. You'll get killed too eventually. Kamiyama finally showed up. Who's that woman? At first I thought I'd seen her before. Anyway, I'll try to push the deal. Mitsuko, someone for you. Itsuko! Hey, sis! He's here. Eh? My husband, Cummings is back. Really? You're Ms. Mitsuko? I'm Cummings, do you remember me? Yes, hello. You must be happy, Itsuko. Yes. We're going to America. In a week we're off to Tokyo, then to America. We'd like to invite you before. Won't you go see grandma? She'd just get mad at me. Be sure to come by. Shall we go, darling? I brought him. Nice to meet you. I'm Ito. Have a seat. You kept me waiting a while. Sorry. Let's get to the point. Here's a sample. It's top-quality. It dissolves entirely in water. I'll pay 80,000 yen per gram. Surely you're kidding. It's 100,000 yen. Otherwise, I'd lose money. Alright, let's make the deal. For the time and place of the transaction... I'll contact you. Alright then. I'll be waiting. What do you think? Can we trust that man? It's your job to make that call. Hey, Yukiko. Kikuchi helped you out, right? Who is he? Speak! He's a detective! You'd better talk, for your own sake. You're addicted to drugs. You'll talk as soon as you need your fix. So just talk! Talk! Who's Kikuchi? Hey... Don't you want your fix? Mr. Kikuchi... Hey. Sorry for calling you. What's up? The boss wants to meet you. It's about the deal. In the ruins of Nakabushiki Castle. It's at the citadelâ€‹. It's right ahead. That's weird. Maybe he's late. Boss, run. Hang on. Don't move. Hey! Wait for me! Finish him! Kunio, hang in there! Hey! Boss... Believe me, please. I didn't set you up. I know that. Save your breath. Boss... My sister, Sally... Sally. Be strong. I'll avenge Kunio's death. You were stupid. Stupid! Come on. Don't cry. Come on. I found this. Kunio... He saved up 2,000,000 yen in my name. Kunio... He told me all the time... Go to America... Find our father. I'm sure he saved the money for that. That's how he was. Sally. Like Kunio said, go to America. Why not? Okinawa's my home. I have nowhere else to go. I'll buy a shop with this money. I'll always live here. How is it? I called the bureau, but they don't know yet where Ito is. I see. Who's that foreigner? Just an acquaintance maybe? No. I feel like I've seen him before. Cummings brought this from America. It's for you. Thank you. Itsuko... He offered you this ring? Isn't it beautiful? He brought back many presents. Like this doll. What's this? It's probably some kind of charm. You should leave it. You're right. Is America a nice place? I'll be there soon. This will be the end of my miserable life. I'm leaving it all behind. Lucky you. Is he out today? Yes. He just came back but he's already doing business at the military base. Since you'll always be together now, it's not much to endure. Very soon. Mitsuko... Come see me off. I will. Hello. Shall I give you a ride? Eh? It's fine. You don't have to hold back. - But. - Come on. Your boyfriend is with the police? Oh, my sister told you that? What's wrong? Ms. Mitsuko, I love you. What are you saying? What about my sister? She's like an ex to me. Wait. Please wait. Let me go. Ito hasn't called Kamiyama. And Kamiyama has booked flights for tomorrow. Really? Then they might be leaving Okinawa already. No, they're not. Ito had that deal with me. So he has at least a kilo of drugs coming soon. Until it's all arrived, he's stuck in Okinawa. She took days off? Yes, and she told me to give you this letter when you come. To Shinjo: I need some time alone - Mitsuko Mitsuko... I haven't seen Cummings since yesterday. Where could he be? Surely you know something. He drove you home. What happened? Itsuko... I'm sorry. I fought as hard as I could. He brutally assaulted me. I lost consciousness. It's my fault. I let it happen... I must have been too familiar. I'm sorry, Itsuko. Cummings dropped this. What happened, Shinjo? Sorry, something came up... Idiot! You chose the wrong time. Take a look at this. Let me see. I was shown the same sample. Where did you find this? Cummings had it, apparently. Cummings? Ms. Itsuko's boyfriend? Yes. I see. It's him. Cummings is their American contact. It's him? I see now. Cummings is their smuggler. What did you do to my sister Mitsuko yesterday? What did you do? What she said was true. You're just an American! An American! You're a barbarian. Damn you! Wait. Ms. Itsuko, Ms. Itsuko. Where is he? Where's Cummings? He just got out. That car we just saw. Mr. Shinjo... Mitsuko... Please take care of Mitsuko. Like Shizuko in Tokyo... I'm dying too. I'm going to see her now. At least... At least let Mitsuko live. Itsuko! I'll get him. Take care of her. I'm Ito. Here are the goods. OK, here is the money. Hold it! You are under arrest. Hands up, slowly. He's alone. OK. Let's surround him. Mr. Kikuchi. You OK? What's the situation? There are four left. Let's go, guys! After him! Catch him! What are you doing here? Didn't you say you wanted me? Now is not the time. What's the rush? There are no planes tonight. Eh? But tell me... If I said we were together, wouldn't you have an alibi? That's true. Head of the K Economic Research Institute Mr. Kamiyama died of a heart attack in Okinawa. Hello, Mr. Tsusai. Is there something I can help with? Mr. Tsujima... You'll gather more influence after these deaths, right? What are you talking about? I know very well what you tried to do in Okinawa. With the Americans... you tried to settle your turf in Okinawa... and raised hell there. Any evidence for that? Evidence? Guys like you never leave evidence. But I will surely nail you down. And that... I will gladly do for those ho died... because of your filthy greed. Boss... Thank you for everything. You did a great job. Shinjo, thank you. Thank you too. Ms. Mitsuko. Ms. Mitsuko. You're stronger than this. Yes. Goodbye. The End
