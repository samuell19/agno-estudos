Have you been around here long enough where you've heard the name Martin McRae? Uh, the guy… yeah, the guy who's gone missing. He saw a lot of my wife. What does that mean? He started seeing a lot of my wife. You suggesting…? They were friends. You want me to believe you did something to Martin McRae? I killed him. Does Melinda know? Oh, God, no. She'd be horrified. All right, bro, considering he was a friend of yours, I don't think it's very funny to joke about... He wasn't a friend of mine. A friend of your wife's. Well... that's obviously something different, isn't it? Are you, like, threatening me? Do you feel threatened? I don't believe you. Then don't. I'll be right back. Joel?

That's one of the things, yes. Is that why you picked me? For my brains? You're very smart, Melinda. Yeah. Not in a way you respect. Joel might be dumb, but me makes me enjoy who I am.

But, boy, did it work. - Thanks. - I don't think I would kill somebody for sleeping with my wife. Who says they slept together? Vic, I don't mean to be the bearer of bad news, but... it's pretty obvious. Isn't that why you threatened him? I didn't threaten anybody. Okay, look, man, I-I don't know, man. Look, coming from somebody who loves and respects you, you gotta reign Melinda in, man. Like, this isn't the first time. The fact she's comfortable, like, flaunting all these relationships around in front of us, is fucked up. Yes, she's a fucked up person. I knew it. I knew it since the moment I saw Joel leave that you had done something disgusting 'cause you're a fucking snake. It was stupid. Fucking stupid. And Martin was my friend... and I miss him. That is… That's not something you joke about. It was a bad idea and I knew it right when it came out of my mouth. - You... - I'm really sorry. You are not just going to apologize to me. You're going to apologize to Joel. I already spoke to him. He's leaving on Saturday, so I invited him over for dinner on Friday. Joel, good to see you. Dinner's almost ready. Melinda wanted to cook, but, uh, Trixie banned her from the stove for two weeks. It's a long story. Is Melinda here? Melinda? No. Just you and me. Why, is that awkward? I'm just fucking with you. Yeah, come on in. So, uh, come on in. Get you a drink? Vodka soda? - Uh, yeah. - Make yourself at home. Have a seat. Thanks. Who's that? That is Joel Dash. He's a friend of your mom's. Kind of like Martin McRae. Remember him? Dry your hands and take this out to Joel. Thank you. No lime, right? Uh, no lime for me, thanks. Thank you. So, you're leaving tomorrow? Uh, yeah. You know, I got a job in New Mexico. It's a good one. Pays well. Pretty exciting. Sounds it. Well, Last Supper it is. Making an old family recipe, lobster bisque. Hint of tang, not too creamy. I think you're gonna love it. I'm actually allergic to shellfish. What? - Yeah, I can't eat it. - You're kidding me. All… any shellfish? No. I've always wanted to visit New Mexico. Yeah. I mean, I'm going to be working in Albuquerque, - which is a little bit different from Santa Fe. - Hmm. Santa Fe is probably more charming, I think. I definitely want to visit Santa Fe 'cause I heard the same thing, it's beautiful. Yeah. Well, maybe we'll come visit. Uh, yeah, I mean, I-I don't know how big my place is going to be, so... Joel, I think if we came and visited, we'd probably stay in a hotel. Oh, right, right. How's the grilled cheese? Actually, it's amazing. - Oh, good. - Can I have some? - Yeah. - A bite? I don't like lobster bisque. Oh, my God. Right? This is amazing. Melinda kind of has the palate of a 12-year-old. Our first date, I took her to the best restaurant in the city - and she ordered mac and cheese. - Yeah. It's like he was ashamed to be with me. No, I just realized you were ordering off the children's menu to save room for alcohol. You see, Vic never drinks. I drink sometimes. Sometimes I think he's not normal. 'Cause normal people can let go. You wish that I were normal, Melinda? - My God, all the time. - 'Cause if I were normal, I don't think Joel would be over here having dinner with us. You don't have to be rude. I'm not being rude. I made lobster bisque. Um... If you guys don't mind, I'm gonna run to the restroom. Good call. Trixie. Baby, I think it's time for bed. Okay. Did you finish that, baby? You know, your dad is gonna read you a bunch of bedtime stories. Wouldn't you like that? Yeah. - Okay? - Okay. Can you come give your mama a kiss? Mmm. Don't let him skip pages. He can be sneaky like that. Good night. "Bedtime Olie is sleeping now without a care. The end. Zzz…" Why is Mom so different around other people? You think Mom's different? Yeah. Don't you? I think that's just who she is. But how can it be who she is if she's different? Mm, because people are strange and grown-ups are complex. I don't like Joel. I know.

Yeah, it's loosely based on me. It's about a writer. Uh, you know, a young guy, uh, writes noir fiction and, uh, he uncovers a vast conspiracy in his town. Uh, it… I think it's interesting.

Don, let's not get into politics. Yeah, but the-the chip is used to kill people. Eh, sometimes used to kill innocent people. Or used to find starving children and drop food off to them. Yeah. But they don't. No. They don't. Look, but the moral of the story is, Vic is a genius and he's rich as fuck. Vic? Vic Van Allen? - Yeah. - Oh. Okay. - Yeah, I know exactly who you are. - Oh.

I mean... like, yes, at a certain point, you think, well, I guess I could, you know, fuck this person. But... Do you think she'd be a better fuck than me? Ow! What was that for? 'Cause the answer was yes. No, it wasn't. Ow! Fuck, Melinda. You're gonna get us killed. Well, if you think Kelly Wilson is a better fuck than me, then I don't mind killing us both.

Okay, who was it drawn to? To a Mr. Charles De Lisle. What was the amount? It was $3,000. Does it say what it was for? The memo line says, "Piano lessons." Right. It makes perfect sense. If you add additional funds to the account, we can waive the $50 overdraft fee. Thank you. I would appreciate that. No problem, sir. Could you spell the recipient's last name, please? Hi. Yeah, I'm just wondering, uh, do you guys have live music in the evenings, by any chance? You don't. All right, that's a shame. Hi. Yeah, I'm wondering, do you guys have live music in the evenings?

The motion aims to not only expand the program but also to include and refine the current targeting system. The vote comes in the wake of a successful strike on an ISIS weapons storehouse just outside of Kabul this past Thursday. Now, opponents of the bill warned this news will only increase tensions overseas. And in breaking news, police have found the body of Martin McRae, the 33-year-old man who went missing from his apartment last spring. McRae's body was found in the woods in La Bouche Parish. He had been shot to death. Stay tuned for your latest in weather coming up after the break. How was your night? Magnificent. Where'd you go? To have dinner with a new friend.

We should have you and Don over for dinner. Uh... Hi. Come in. Hey, come on in. - I love them. - Oh, thanks. - Kelly, you look so beautiful, I can't stand it. - Hi. Oh, thank you, Vic. - Hi. - Don, thanks for coming. Come on in. Thanks for having us. This way. Do you know anything about snails, Don? I can't say I do. A snail will climb a 12-foot wall to find its mate. - It's the smell. - Huh. Mind if I smoke? Please don't... it'll kill 'em. Oh, well, we don't want that. Don, I need you to stop telling people that I killed Charlie De Lisle. Is that right? Yes. I think it's hurting your reputation. I think it's hurting Kelly's reputation. Well, that's funny that you're not worried it'll hurt yours. You know, I was gonna ask you what you think killed Charlie. What killed him? Well, just, who dies like that? Accidentally in a swimming pool? Thousands of people a year. What do you think killed him? - I think you drowned him. - Yeah? I heard I killed Martin McRae, too. You said you killed him. Did you believe me? No. Good for you. I thought it was weird, though, that you said you did, that you seemed to take pleasure in it. And that was enough for you to share my wife's opinion? It's my opinion. Would you, uh, be willing to take a lie detector test saying you didn't kill him? Sure. Get one. You're a weird guy. So I've been told. Hey, hon. Hi. Um, we're having lunch. Oh. I was just going to get something to go, but I can join you for a second. - Hi. - Hi. This is my husband, Vic. - Victor Van Allen. - Oh. - It's, uh, nice to meet you. - You, too. This is David Ricigliani. He's opening a practice here. Oh. What kind of practice? Psychotherapy. Well, this town definitely needs that. - You think? - First practice? Uh, no, no. I actually closed my practice in Cheshire recently. - Upgraded. - Yeah. I'm curious, do you think my wife has schizophrenic tendencies? - What? - Well, he's a professional. I thought I'd ask. No. - It's possible he may have some insight as to… - You're such an asshole. - No, I don't think so at all. - Hmm. Do you think my husband might be psychopathic for asking you that? Or maybe just an asshole? Uh… how about, uh, couples therapy? I was going to get something to go for the guys, but maybe I'll just skip it, huh? Hate to interrupt your lunch. I'm used to this. Nice to make your acquaintance, David. You don't happen to have a card, do you? 'Cause I may need a psychotherapist. Oh, uh... No, no. I… I don't have any on me. Mm-hmm. Well, I know where to find you. Hi. - Oh. - Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt. I didn't know it was dinnertime, but... No, no, no, no, sit down, please. This will just take a second. Hi. I just have a question for Don. You know a guy named David Ricigliani? Um... Who's David Ricigliani? He's a man your husband hired. Who did you hire? A private investigator. What for? To follow me. This is ridiculous. - How could you do that, Don? - I made him a week ago. I ran into him at a diner with Melinda. Go outside, I see a telephoto lens in the back of his car. Oh, my God. Guy tried to tell me he was a psychotherapist. Where'd you find this guy? You can't just walk into my house and accuse me, in front of my family... Apparently, anybody can accuse anyone of anything. Unlike you, however, Don, I have proof. This is a bank record of a wire from my wife to your account for $743.50, which is sort of an unusual amount, so I assume you went splitsies on the retainer. - Your wife… - Oh, my God. Have you lost your mind? What the fuck were you thinking, Don? Goldie, go inside. - Uh, this is, this is humiliating. - At least tell me where you found him. Your wife wired that money to me. - Back of a newspaper? - Goldie, I said inside. It's from your wife. - Sorry to interrupt your dinner. - No, no, no. Don't you apologize for anything. I'm the one who's sorry. What the hell are you apologizing to him for? Are you kidding me, Don? - Don't apologize to this piece of shit. - Will you stop, Don? Goldie, I thought I told you to go inside. She did tell you to go inside. Go inside, Goldie. Go inside, Goldie! Goddamn it. Who left the fucking gate open? Hey. - Daddy? - Mm-hmm. When Charlie drowned in the swimming pool, did his feet touch the bottom? I don't know. I wasn't there. Sure, you were there. Well, I was there when we were trying to save him... everyone was... but everything happened very quickly. But you still know what you did. I didn't do it, honey. I think you're kidding me. I'm not. I'm not, Trix. Why won't you tell me how you did it? Everyone keeps asking me how you did it. Sweetheart... ...if I did kill someone... ...do you know what they would do to me? They would put me in prison for the rest of my life. Do you understand? I still think you drowned him. You're just telling me you didn't. Well, let's keep that between us. Rita. Kangaroo. Bring sloth back in. You, you? Yes? It's killing me. What? Brazil? I've never been to Brazil. Yes. No, she would. She'd love it. She'll get used to it. What'd you say? Oh, we can talk. Love you. How was your night? You don't want to tell me? You just don't want to talk. - You must be Vic. - Yeah. - Tony Cameron. - Hi. Old friend of Melinda's. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Thank you for having me over. - Sure. - Nice space you got here. - Thank you very much. Yeah, it's like a science lab. Kind of. Are those snails? Yeah. Check it out. Wow. How about that? Huh. Um, is Melinda here? Yeah, she's upstairs. All right. All right, well, I guess I'll see you up there. - Great. - Okay. Yeah, so I've been working on, uh, building LEED-certified housing. - Oh. - Yeah. In both-both here in the States and-and also in Brazil, actually. That's where our new initiative is. 'Cause, you know, the point is, well, if we can create sustainable living spaces for people around the world, we can help create a more sustainable planet. You know, for-for… for Trixie. You know, for the, for the next generation. Can I get you a drink? I'll take a sparkling water, if you got it. Sure. Thank you. Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - There you are. - Tony. - Hi. - Hi. Wow, it's great to see you. - Hola. - Hola. Hi. ¿Cómo estás? I can't believe you're here. - I know, it's been a while. - It's just crazy. I know. How are you? I'm great. I'm great. Great. You hungry? Yeah, actually, I'm starving. I'm starving. Well, that's why I came over, obviously. - Starving's good. - Yeah. Here you go. Thank you. Can I help? - No. - No? - No. - All right. Is he being nice? He's very nice. Very nice. I was just telling him how we reconnected. I was, I was working in the state legislature here and we started just chatting on Facebook. I think what you're doing is very inspiring. Well, thank you. - If that counts. - Thank you. - Right? - I'm just... - Very admirable. - Yeah. Just, I'm happy it gives me a chance to reconnect with old friends. Fun fact: Tony was the first American I fucked. - What? You blushing? - Just... Well, it's just… Are you okay? It's just an unnecessary amount of detail, Melinda. Well, it's true. What? Wha...? Don't worry about Vic. - He couldn't care less. - Oh. He's doesn't want to control me like a normal man. Uh, no, I'm not normal. As somebody who dated her, Vic, I-I really sympathize with you. She's-she's a very difficult person - to control. - Oh, yeah. Right? But that's also what makes her special. You know that. And then you broke up with me. - Did I? - Yes, you did. He broke my heart. - It's not true. - You did, too. Smells great over here, by the way. - Thank you, thank you, thank you. - Yeah. Mmm. Vic, you know what we should do is get some-some snails. That sounds amazing. Garlic and a little butter? - Want me to get 'em? I can get 'em. - Come on. No, the snails aren't for eating. Oh, sorry. They're not for eat... What are they, what are they for? They're not for anything. Well, you won't miss a dozen or so, will you? The snails are not for eating. No, he won't. Just go get them. I mean, they're-they're not like your pets, are they? Fun fact: You know you have to starve them, right? What? Before you eat them, you have to make sure their intestines are empty. Otherwise, you'll poison yourself and you'll die. I did not know that. No snails. Who knew? Hey, Tony. Oh, Vic. That's funny. Melinda's been trying to get ahold of you. She's got a building site she wants to show you. She keeps talking about it. Oh, really? She didn't, uh, say anything. Well, come on, jump in. All right. It's really a beautiful spot. Melinda and I used to go hiking up there back when we started dating. Sounds nice. So why'd you break up with her? What? You know, when you guys were young. Oh. You know, I really don't remember. I… It was such a long time ago. Going a little fast, Vic, don't you think? So you guys just, like, reconnected? Uh, yeah. I mean, a couple months ago, just casually. You gonna be in town for a while? This is the way, huh? Yep. Should I give Melinda a call? Sure, go ahead. There's no service. Oh, that's right. I forgot. Here we are. Where's Melinda? She and I used to go mountain biking up here. There's a gorge just across the way. She said we should meet her there. Ah, fuck. Oh, fuck. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Stop, stop. Here? You're gonna fall. You're gonna fall. What are you guys doing? How's Tony? - Right here? - Mm-hmm. I don't know. I like him. He's actually got brains. I'm going to pour you just a glass, 'cause we're celebrating. Now we toast. May the boys of St. Vincent's keep their hands off our pigtails. What are you doing? You getting her drunk? We're celebrating. What are you celebrating? Oh, life. Wine. Have you seen him? Who? Tony. - Tony. - Tony Pony! - Tony Pony? - Tony Maloney! Tony Baloney, I have not seen. Daddy? Yes. We're going on a picnic. Do you want to come with us? I would love to. Where we going? The gorge. The gorge? Why are you the only man who wants to stay with me? I don't know. But you do? I do. You're not bored? No. Are you? But I'm sad. I got you something. You didn't know I took that. - I was three months pregnant. - Mm-hmm. Thank you. Roger! - Hey, Trixie! - Roger! Trix! - Hold on. Hold on. - She's fine, she's fine. - I'll be right back. - Stay. - Trix! Uh... - Vic, stay. Trixie, back up, honey. Get away from the edge, sweet pea. Back up, back up, back up. Thank you. Okay. We have to go back, okay? This is too close to the edge. - Let's go. - Okay. Okay. Oh, damn. I left my scarf up there. I'm sorry. We can't go back now. Oh, I'll go back for it. But like tomorrow. - Would you? - Yeah. I'll go back and get it first thing in the morning. Okay. Thank you. No problem. - Hey. Can I get you some tea? - Hi. No, I'm fine. She went down so easy, but I told her you'd come give her a kiss. - Okay? - Okay. Hey, wh-who were you, uh, on the phone with? Tony? No. I haven't heard from Tony. That was Don. Can you sleep in my room tonight? - Sure. - Please. I love you. Vic? Vic? Hey, there! Hi. Hi. What are you doing? Uh, just, uh, went for a little ride. Uh, Melinda forgot her scarf. - Oh. - Found it. Found it. Great. Thanks. So, which... How you doing? How's Kelly? She's fine. What are you doing down here? Like I said, just, uh, looking for that scarf, but... you got it, so... It was lying in the grass. Oh. What are you doing with that stick? Nothing. Oh, shit. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck you, you fucking psycho! You're going to jail! Come get me now, you piece of shit! Are you gonna catch me on your bike?! You motherfucker. Where'd you go? Did I lose ya? I was right. I was right. Kelly, you are not gonna believe this. This is… this is it. This is a book. Trixie? Fuck. Trixie, what are you doing? We're not going! I was… was... Goddamn, fucking autocorrect. Goddamn it. Oh! What? Nothing.
