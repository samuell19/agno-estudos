[mellow music] [birds chirping] [Brian] Ooh, whee! It's about to be so good. -Yeah. -Mmm. -I love the smell of bacon. -Me too. -You know I got you, baby. -Uh-hmm. Yes, sir. [sighs] So was Oscar released? Scot-free. You already know how we do it. That's another win for the Nelson clan. -[chuckles] -Uh-hmm. Yeah, you gotta stop taking Anthony's dirty money. Baby, it ain't dirty money if I get paid to win a case, all right? And, plus, you and I both know Oscar was not about to last another day up in there. Yeah. And you and I both know that Oscar's guilty. Maybe so, but I got 12 jurors to say that he's innocent. Babe, help me understand. Why do you always think you have to save everybody? Everybody can't be saved. Yeah, but Oscar is like family, babe. I got... I always gotta look out for him. Well, hopefully, Oscar has enough sense to stay away from Anthony this time. Yeah, that's not gonna happen 'cause Oscar idolizes Ant too much. Hmm, well, Anthony should be a good brother and get Oscar out of this lifestyle, because we all know like Oscar is just not built like Anthony is. I know. I tried to tell them both that. But they don't listen. They both hardheaded. And, you know, Anthony, he don't listen to nobody. Yeah. He don't listen to nobody but himself. And maybe that wife that's half his age. [laughter] Wait. Dad, are you gonna be able to come today? You promised. Karla, are you gonna be able to stop watching all the movies that you watch? -You promised. -[sighs] Whatever, Dad. Oh, whatever. Listen. Baby girl, check this out. -Okay. -Your daddy's with you all day because today is my off day, all right? And you got me all day today too, baby, and I wish you would have made some more bacon 'cause with the eggs, it makes me fart. -I don't-- -Wait. -Okay. -You know, I'm just-- -I'm just being real. -Wait. Uncle Oscar's on the news. [reporter] And it looks like he's armed and has a hostage. Baby, turn it up. Turn it up. [reporter] ...and so far, there are no casualties. -[helicopter blades whirring] -[radio chatter] [Oscar] Stay back or I swear to God I'm killing her. Get Brian. [phone rings] Hello? Yeah. Yeah. I just turned it on. I'm watching it right now. What's going on? [sighs] All right. I'm on my way. Wait. Dad, you promised. Look, baby girl, I promise I'll make it up to you, okay? Okay. -I gotta go. -Babe, honestly, I think you should let the authorities handle this. -You're just an attorney, babe. -Look, I'm family, okay? He's out there asking for me. I gotta go, babe. It's gonna be okay. Listen, I'll call you on the way there, okay? -All right. -Okay. -Love you. -Love you. Love you, Karla. -Babe, be careful, babe. -[Brian] I got it. [suspenseful music] [car engine starts] [suspenseful music] [helicopter blades whirring] Yo, what's going on in here? I gotta get up. Hold it, Nelson. We can't let you go in there. [Oscar] Go away! This is between me and my girl! Your boy's been held up in there for two hours. I know Oscar. I can help y'all. We got a call for a possible armed suspect behaving erratically. When we got here, he ran inside. There's a hostage. [sighs] It must be his girlfriend. [Oscar] Get me, Brian, now! You heard him. I gotta go. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I say we let him in. The chief will have our ass, man. Yo, get him a vest. [sighs] [suspenseful music] -[woman sobs] -Shut up. All right, look, you're not going in, but you can talk to him at the door while we find an alternative route in. -You got me? -Yup. Now, look, Nelson, don't make me regret this. -You can trust me. -I got your back. Got it. [Det. Copeland] Yo, cover him. Oscar, it's me, Brian. [Oscar] B? Yeah. [Oscar] I'm sorry, man. I know this looks bad. I just-- It's all good. I'm coming up. I just wanna talk to you. It's me by myself and I'm unarmed. I just wanna talk to you. [Oscar] Don't lie to me, Brian. I'm not lying. It's just me. [Oscar] You swear? [knocks on door] -Open it. -No, no, no. No. No. Open it. -Fall back. -Damn it, man. Oscar! Oscar! Oscar! What you're doing, man? You're tripping. -Put the gun down, bro. -I know. I know what you're thinking, but it's not my fault, man. It's hers. She's been screwing some other guy, man. [woman] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look. Look. She's sorry. She's sorry, okay? I'm sorry. Everybody's sorry. Sorry? Do you know the types of things that I had to put up with in there? The things that were done to me? All she had to do was hold me down. I know, and I get. Oscar, bro, you don't wanna do this. -No. Back up. -All right. I know what I'm doing, B. All right. It's your world, Oscar. You see, everybody thinks I'm weak. That's why they think they can do whatever they want to me. But I know what I'm doing. I know you know what you're doing, all right? But this ain't the way to go, all right? Just think for a second. What would your brother do? [Oscar sighs] He'd do this. -No! No! -[woman] No! [gunshot] No! Oscar, no! [gunshot] [suspenseful music] -Good evening. -Good evening. [suspenseful music] [gunshots] [operator] 911. What's your emergency? [man] A man just shot two people across the street from me. [operator] And you witnessed this altercation how, sir? [man] From my living room window. [reporter] Infamous drug kingpin, Anthony Santiago, was arrested and charged today with the double murder of his wife, Candace Santiago, and her supposed lover, Vincent Capprilla. Sources say he was following them and planned the kill. [speaking Spanish] They have two eyewitnesses placing you at the scene and the gun is registered in your name. As your attorneys, we think the best thing for you to do is to take the DA's plea deal. [chuckles] [speaking Spanish] Whatever it takes. [dramatic music] [exhales] [groans] [exhales] [shower running] [Brian] Yeah, I miss you too, baby girl. I know I ain't came to see you in a minute but things between me and your mom have been kind of funny, so-- Well, do you think you guys are gonna get back together? Uh... no, I don't think she's gonna reconsider this time. Well, have you found a new job yet? [Brian] I've been looking. I ain't found none yet though. [Karla] Dad, I thought you said you had something already. [sighs] I thought I had something but it was nothing. -Well, you have to try harder. -Baby, trust me when I tell you I'm trying so hard. Well, I mean, have you maybe thought about going back to the-- [Brian] No. I can't go back there. And they wouldn't even take me back if I tried. [Karla] It's what you're good at, Dad. Was. It's just what I was good at. Look, I'mma be over there in a minute anyway 'cause I gotta stop by and grab a few things, so I'll see you soon. I love you, baby girl. Love you too. See you soon. All right. Bye. -[sighs] -[singer] ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ Woo ♪ It's all we need ♪ All we need is love ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ All we need ♪ All we need is love ♪ And can we get together? [Charlie] I had a really good time. [Lynette] Baby, I had so much fun. [chuckles] I'm probably gonna come back later. -That's cool? -Of course, it is. Yeah? I was thinking I can make some lobster with mashed potatoes. [Charlie] That sounds good. Asparagus or something. Mmm. All that. -I'm so excited? -Uh-hmm. -I wanna foot rub. -I'mma come back. -Okay. Well, what time? -I got you food though. Hey. Brian, what are you doing here? -What's up, bro? -Good to meet you, man. Brian, what the hell is wrong with you? Stay away from my family, homey. Brian, what is your problem? Look, I ain't signing the divorce papers. You know that. Yo, I'm not your wife anymore! Dad? Karla, baby, go back in the house. We're just out here talking, all right? [Lynette] Go in the house. You need to leave. Now. Now! Yeah. Whatever. [Lynette sighs] Baby, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, baby. [car engine revs] [singer] ♪ It's my heart ♪ Baby, I just want you over me ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ I just want you over me ♪ I just want you over me ♪ You are, you are, you are all that I want... ♪ [sighs] Make mine a double. How you find me, man? Brian, I find people for a living. Plus, I'm the last friend you got that actually gives a damn. And this is the, um... last crappy bar in town, so it wasn't that hard. [chuckles] Hmm. That's what's up. I did some research like you asked. The guy that Lynette's dating, I mean, he's out of DC, rich family, but he checks out clean. He's a good guy. Yeah. Excuse me if I ain't so enthused about my wife date another man. Ex-wife. I ain't signed the papers yet. But, man, you gotta get it together, man. Get back to work. Get your life back. I'm worried about you, man. My life was Lynette and Karla. You ain't gotta worry about me. I'm all right. You know what? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Next round on me. Hey, let's get it. I'm good. I'm good. I'mma call you, all right? Hey B, you're gonna be all right? Aight. Good. Good. [rock music] If you wanna live, do exactly as I say. Hey, if you--if you're looking for money, I ain't got none. I assure you, I'm not. Then what's this about? Tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM, I'll be waiting outside of your house. Get in the car, do exactly as I say, and no one will get hurt, including your wife and daughter. Look, you touch my family, homey, -and I promise you-- -[man] Yeah. Yeah. I know. But from where I'm standing, it doesn't seem like you're in the position to be making threats. I work for Anthony Santiago. [Brian] Anthony? [chuckles] So what makes you always wanna meet at your grandma's house? To remind you where you came from, Hot-Shot Lawyer. [laughs] Yeah, you know me. I will never forget where I came from. Maybe it's so minor for me then. I'll keep eyes on this house, make sure nobody bothers it. Yeah. Man, your grandma was the best. She always kept an ashtray full of pecans and peppermints right by the door. [laughter] That's right, those where her favorites. Yeah. If she could see us now, you think she'd be disappointed? I definitely think she would make you go to that altar. With her anointing oil and holy water. She used to spray that on everybody, be all over the house. Thanks for getting Oscar out, B. I appreciate it. [Brian] Ain't no thing, man. You know he's not built for this life. Yeah, I know. My bad about not catching the warrant day, and he would've been out a little bit earlier. It's all good. You know... I don't wanna judge you or Oscar's decision-making -after your grandma died-- -Good, then don't. Listen, I'm starting this offshore account. I could really use your help. Oh, no, no, no. You don't try to make me your personal consigliere. Okay? Because it ain't gonna happen, all right? -Consigliere. -I don't mind working with you and Oscar on these little Knick Knack Paddy Whack deals but, uh, as far as your empire's illicit affairs, you can count me out. [laughs] Plus I'm sure there's some young thirsty, money hungry, slime ball attorney that would just love to be on Anthony Santiago's payroll. [laughter] Might be right... but they ain't had grandma's cooking. Oh. That's right. That's right. I'mma see you at the barbecue this year? Yeah. Me and Lyn might swing through. -[Anthony] I love you. -I love you, brother. -Give the family my love. -I will. Mi Amore. -[Brian] Bye, Candace. -Bye, Brian. Hey, you make sure you keep this one in line, all right? If only that were possible. [laughter] Hey, give that consigliere idea some thought, yeah? Thought about it. The answer's still no. You and your big words. Speaking of big, this... stack's a little big, don't you think? You earned it. Plenty more where that came from, hotshot! [engine starts] You can tell Anthony I ain't interested, man. [man] Mr. Nelson, you do not have a choice. If you do not comply, I will murder your entire family, Lyn and Karla first. We have people watching them right now. So if you try any funny business, I guarantee you... I will blow both of their brains out. Now... you have eight hours to decide whether your family lives or dies. Lock your door. [sighs] [birds chirping] [phone ringing] -Hello? -[Zulu] Mr. Nelson. It's 8:00 AM. You're late. Anthony doesn't like late. [groaning] Gosh. [siren blaring] [door beeping] Mr. Nelson. I was beginning to think you weren't gonna make it. Yeah, what's this about? [Anthony] Have a seat. I hope Zulu wasn't too rough on the family. Really? That's where we at now, Ant? That's what you gonna do to me? Send your guard dog to threaten me and my family? [Anthony] Lower you voice, Counselor. We don't want prying ears listening. My bad. Maybe I should just go out there and tell them what you did then. And maybe I should have Zulu finish what he started. This is low, dawg. Even for you. It's good to see you too old friend. You look like shit. What happened to you, B? You tanked your career? You gave up law? You know what happened, man. He was your brother. He was like my brother. Thought that might be what it was. I don't mind saying, I hate the turn your life has taken since that day. You said my life? The last time I checked, I wasn't a convict, bro. Not a convict. Accused. Which is why I need your help. I didn't do this, B. Let me get this straight. I don't take your case, you send your boy Zulu to kill me and my family, right? No. No. I would never hurt Lyn and Karla. They're like family to me too. Zulu was just my way of getting you here. Pretty dramatic, don't you think? Would you have come otherwise? I see your point. I would hope that you would take this case out of a sense of brotherhood, history. I mean for God sakes, B, I've known you since I was seven years old. You really gonna sit back and watch me fry for something I didn't do? Call your boy Zulu off no matter what my answer is? I can't do that. See, I need... some sort of insurance. Make sure you don't go dark on me like you did your career. Leave my family out of this and I might think about it. You say that with so much conviction in your voice, like you actually have a choice. I never did, did I? We're family, amigo, like it or not. Family looks out for each other. Even if sometimes they need a little extra push. Aight. Smart man. I'll reach out to the team and have them get you updated. Oh, and, uh, you might wanna keep this between us. I don't want you inadvertently jeopardizing this case. Now you can go. Oh, and B, I can't have my attorneys looking like that. Clean yourself up. Yeah, sure.

We have B. -[Brian] Oh, yeah. Man, Mr. Santiago said that you might agree to come on board, but... I honestly didn't believe it. Yeah, well look, full discloser, we had a wager on whether you've even show up. -I guess I won. [laughs] -All right. Enough with the chit chat gentlemen, let's get right up into it. What y'all got for me? Nothing. Well, the state has motive. Two possibly three witnesses, uh, murder weapon registered under our client's name, which was found at the crime scene. And the police has... these photos of the wife's affair. [Lebowits] Now, cops had Mr. Santiago's wife under surveillance for about six months -before the murders. -Uh-hmm. They called it off because they couldn't find anything. But then, the next day, our client's wife and her lover were killed. All right, so hold on. Back it up for me a little bit. You said it's possibly three witnesses? Yup. Cops are having trouble finding on the third, the one that made the call. They think Mr. Santiago's people might've gotten to the witness and spook him. Hmm, okay. So what about the alibi? Where's Mr. Santiago saying he was the night of the murder? [Lebowits] He won't say. What do you mean, he won't say? He won't say. He won't tell us where he was. All he tells us is it doesn't matter because he is innocent. This is where we're hoping you can succeed where we failed, Brian. Talk to the guy. Make him understand the reality of the situation. We got trial in four days and we don't have a leg to stand on here. All right. I got you. All right. We have an office we can set you up in. Take some time. Look at the evidence. You'll see just how screwed we are. -[laughter] -[Lebowits] Good luck. -[Brian] All right. -The guy's difficult, man. -Got you this way, man. -[telephone ringing] [suspenseful music] [suspenseful music] [sighs] [Jay] Have a seat, Mr. Nelson. Didn't you heard him? [Jay] I'm not gonna ask again. Sit down. [Brian sighs] [Killa] Oh, no, my nigga, I wouldn't do that if I was you. You're the new attorney on Anthony Santiago's case, correct? Yeah, that's me. Who are you? [Jay] Who I am, Mr. Nelson, isn't important. But why I'm here is. All right. So why is that? I would like for Mr. Santiago to stay right where he is. See, his current circumstances are making me a wealthy man. So... I wanna offer you the same thing I offered the other guys. You want me to drop the case. Actually the opposite. I want you to stay on. I want you to screw things up enough to ensure that Santiago stays locked up. You do this for me, I'll make you a very rich man. Half now... and half when the case is over with. Look, no disrespect, but I don't want your money. If I screw this case up, Anthony's gonna know it's me and he's gonna have my family killed. Well, I guess your candle is burning at both ends, son. Because actually you don't have a choice. Did you offer my associates the same deal? [scoffs] Have a nice night, Mr. Nelson. [sighs] What's shaking, counselor? When're you getting me outta here? First of all, you want me on this case, you need to call off your dog, all right? I can't be at my best when you got Zulu hovering over my family like he doing. You're right. I need you at your best. I'll back Zulu off. Secondly, I'm gonna need that alibi if I'mma get you off. Without the alibi, we lose. It's a done deal, aight? That's the only way I'mma get you off. That's if you're really innocent. -I can't do that. -Then I can't help you. -You think I did this? -[Brian chuckles] Doesn't really matter what I think. I'm only here to protect my family. You know that. I'm innocent, B. Look, if you innocent, then give me that alibi! I shouldn't need one if I didn't do it. That's exactly why you need an alibi, to prove your innocence. You know what? I don't even believe you. All right? And if I don't believe you, I can't convince the jury to believe you. So that's it. It's a wrap. I'm off the case. Touch my family, and you'll spend the rest of your life in here, all right? Guard! [Anthony] It ain't that easy, little brother. By the time you reach the gate, your family will be dead. Look, what is it that you want from me, Ant? Okay, what's up, man? Okay. What are my options? [sighs] Take the plea deal that the DA's offering. No. I didn't do it, B. -[sighs] -I'm innocent, for once. And I'm not taking a plea deal for something I didn't do. Listen. Ballistics matched the bullets to your gun. Okay? There's two eyewitnesses that identified you at the crime scene. There's security footage of a man that fits your description running down the stairwell just moments after the bullets was fired, bro. This is a by the book open and shut case. Without that alibi, you lose. It's nothing, it's over. Best bet is the DA's deal, man. [Anthony] You know why I chose you, B? Because you got my brother off. You're the only person on this planet that coulda done that. Because like you said, he was like a brother to you too. But here we are. You know, you and I were once like brothers. The only difference between me and Oscar... is that I really am innocent. You're saying he wasn't? [Anthony] Come on. What, you're gonna act like you didn't know? And why are you bringing this up now? Because I know you're the only one that can prove my innocence. I'm not a miracle worker, bruh. Well, I guess you have some incentive now, don't you? Guard. -Hey. -What's up? I appreciate you coming to meet me. You got five minutes, Brian. All right. Look, I just want to tell you that... I'm taking on a new case. A new case? Since when did you...wait. Oh, my God, Brian. Please tell me you're not taking on Anthony's murder trial. -Are you? -Yup. What? What are you thinking? That man has practically destroyed you. Destroyed us! What would make you wanna throw your hat in the ring with him again? Look, that's why I tried to come to the house and warn you. Anthony is the one that threatened to hurt you and Karla. Anthony? Me and Karla? No. -Are you serious? -Yes! And we know what a snake Anthony is, but look, that's not important. The important thing is, I would die first before I let anything happen to you or Karla. I still love you. I know, Brian. I just... I don't want you to get hurt. I ain't gonna get hurt, all right? Look, regardless of all the mess I made of us, just let me fix this. All right? If you feel anything weird or you see anything funny, any funny movement, you know what to do, all right? Okay. Thank you. Brian, I am glad to see you cleaned yourself up. I will say that. Take care. [dramatic music] [suspenseful music] [upbeat music] Now, you wasn't gonna try to warn him, right? Because that would be a very bad idea. Yeah. This Zulu cat is bad news, B. I mean, real bad news. [sighs] Man. He threatened my family. He know where I live, he know where my wife work. Man, you gotta get your family the hell outta here. And you can't go to the police. I know. You think you got somewhere where you can get them safe off the grid or something like that? You know, I might have an old army buddy or two that might have some off-the-grid type places. I'll look into it for you, partner. All right, cool. Soon as you give me the word that my family is safe... I'm dropping off the case. You bet. You bet. That is the right call. Hey, hey. What's happenin'? Hold up. You took the money, Brian. And it don't seem like you're doing what we asked you to. Look, you can have the money back. I ain't even touched the money. Why you rolling up on me in front of my apartment? I don't think you understand. We made a deal. The money is not refundable. Like Jay said, either Anthony stays in or you die. It's simple. Look, I can't just lose the case like that. Anthony knows I'm better than that. You gotta give me some time. It's a marathon, not a race. Well, your time is ticking on your marathon. You got a week to fumble this case, if not, we're gonna find somebody else. But if we do that, there's no more need for you. Understood. We'll be watching. [suspenseful music] Yeah. Anthony. I think we got a problem. [door lock buzzes] When were you gonna tell me about your little deal with Jay? That's why you ain't got me outta here yet, right? Look, dude showed up in my house with a briefcase full of cash, told me if I didn't lose the case, I'm a dead man. And judging by all the money that he offered me, I'd say he's pretty motivated to keep you in here. Uh-hmm. Sound like you're stuck between two trains. On one side, you have your family's life. On the other, you have your own. What will you choose, Brian? [laughs] You know what's crazy? Is you say we're like family, yet instead, you threaten my family. So tell me, Ant. What makes you different than Jay? Easy. You help me, I keep your family safe. You help him, he still kills you and your family. Look, one thing I did learn is why you haven't gotten off yet. What are you saying, B? I'm saying that I don't think I'm the first one that he offered this little "deal" to. [scoffs] So what do you think? Should I fire 'em? [Brian] Nah. Keep them on the case. They got good resources. [Anthony] You're right. You see, that's why I need you on the team, B. You're the only one I can trust. You know, it's funny I can't say the same thing about you. [laughs] I'll see you in court tomorrow. -[door lock buzzes] -[suspenseful music] [indistinct chatter] [Courtney] That's the lobby from our north entrance. This is footage from the north elevator. Uh, so there's two minutes before residents reported hearing gunshots. [Melissa] Let's pause it. Let the record show that there was not forced entry. The assailant opened the door with their own set of keys. Continue. [Courtney] This is in our northeast, uh, stairwell and fire exit. This was 15 seconds after gunshots were reported by the residents. [footsteps approaching] [exhales] Mr. Haskins, has the video been altered or tampered with at all? Not to my knowledge. And can you vouch for its authenticity? Yes, I can. Has anyone else handled the video besides yourself? [Courtney] No. I turned it over to the investigating officer personally. Thank you, Mr. Haskins. No further questions. [Judge Gentry] Mr. Nelson? [Brian] Uh, nothing, Your Honor. Thank you, Mr. Haskins. You may step down. I think we've all heard enough for one day. Court will resume Monday after the weekend. [gavel bangs] This is where you trust me, all right? I got you, Ant. [suspenseful music] So, you want me to break this footage down -frame by frame? -That's right. Make sure there's no anomalies, all right? Make sure the footage ain't been tampered with either. And when do you need this done by? I'm thinking like yesterday. I can do that. If the price is right. Well, no doubt. The price is gonna be right. [Howey] Huh. Interesting. [suspenseful music] Hmm. [suspenseful music] Your Honor, the defense would like to call Mr. Howard McDonald to the stand, please. Objection, Your Honor. The state was not made aware of this witness. I can assure you that Mr. McDonald was brought into our employ about one or two days ago. He is a digital analyst and his testimony is very key to proving my client's innocence. [Judge Gentry] I'll allow it. Let's see where this thing goes. Thank you. Please place your hand on the Bible, raise your right hand. You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in the case now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, -so help you God? -[Howey] I do. [Brian clears throat] Mr. McDonald, thanks for joining us today. Uh, Mr. McDonald, can you please explain to the courtroom exactly what it is that you do for a living? I work in data analytics and specialize in digital media. Objection, Your Honor. The state has not had enough time to properly vet this witness. I mean, are we supposed to just trust this man at his word? How do we even know that he can do what he-- I completed undergrad at Purdue University, where I graduated in the top one percent of my class. I received my first master's degree from Stanford University with a concentration on analytics and digital design. I worked for two years as the head of encryption defragmentation at a top Fortune 500 company. And, I periodically dabble in overseas digital defense for the CIA. So trust me, lady, I'm the real deal. [Judge Gentry] Overruled. [clears throat] You may continue. Mr. McDonald, have you had a chance to view the footage of the night of the murders? [Howey] Yes, I have. And in your professional opinion-- It's fake. [audience murmuring] -[Judge Gentry] All right. -[gavel banging] Order. Fake? That's a pretty, pretty bold statement. You mind clarifying what you mean by "It's fake?" I mean, it's been tampered with. Portions of the footage are real, but there are other parts that have been manipulated. You mind telling us which parts you believe have been manipulated? Specifically, the footage from the elevator. From what I can see, it looks to be a deepfake. Deepfake? So, Mr. McDonald, can you explain to the courtroom exactly what a deepfake is? [Howey] You've all seen them before, whether you realize it or not. Deepfake is basically photoshopping for the 21st Century. Deepfakes use a form of artificial intelligence called deep learning to make images of fake events. Hmm. And you're implying that the reflection of my client in the elevator door was a deepfake? I've reviewed the footage a hundred times so yes, that's what I'm saying. Mr. McDonald, do you know exactly whose reflection is in the elevator door? No. Not without the original footage. No further questions, Your Honor. Mrs. Beamon, would you like to cross? Yes, Your Honor. Mr. McDonald, I just have one question for you, about this... [laughs] this crazy, wide-range conspiracy that the defense is attempting to construct. What James Bond villain do you suggest supposedly tampered with the security footage? Objection, Your Honor. There's no way for him to be able to know who tampered with the footage. [Judge Gentry] You're the one who sprung the witness on the state. I think they've earned a little leeway. Go ahead and answer the question. I don't know about any James Bond villain, but what I do know is whoever did this isn't an amateur. They're good. They've done it before. And can you prove this so-called deepfake? Or are we just supposed to take you at your word? Um, I can't really prove it, but in my profession I can say with 100% certainty that it is one. But you can't prove it. Correct? No, ma'am. But you can't prove that it's real either. No further questions. [Judge Gentry] You may step down. [suspenseful music] Hey, guard, can I have a minute with my client? Yeah, I'll give you some privacy. Thanks. [suspenseful music] Ant, man, this charade gotta stop, bro, okay? I may have convinced a couple of the jurors with the whole fake footage thing but you still ain't gave me that alibi. You know what? I don't think you got one. I know you killed Candace. But it don't even matter whether you're innocent or guilty because it is what it is, bro, all right? I'mma get you off like I promised. At this point, I just wanna keep my family safe. [chuckles] That's funny. It is what it is. [chuckles] Remember back in the day, when them putas beat your ass and stole your ice cream money? [chuckles] And then you came running back to my abuela's house crying like a little bitch? [laughter] Yeah, man, Ms. Santiago made you come back with me up the block. We beat them fools' ass -up and down that block-- -[Brian] Yes, sir. --stole their ice cream money. [laughter] We went back to Ms. Santiago, we told her what happened, she just looked us at us and said, -"It is what it is." -"It is what it is." [laughter] Yeah, man. Those were simpler times back then, huh? Before you and your moms moved away. What happened to you after Oscar died, B? [exhales] Yeah, man, I just... watching Oscar do what he did... [sighs] It's just...it was crazy. I just... I watched him just shoot his girl and put the bullet to his head. After that, I just... I just shut down, man. I start shutting down everybody, Lynette, Karla. Started drinking. The nightmares, they just... they wouldn't stop. Soon, I started drinking more to make myself go to sleep but I literally watched somebody murder someone, somebody that I set free, murder someone. [sighs] It all just went down, you know, from there. I was showing up to court drunk. That's when Lynette just kicked me out. What happened with Oscar and his family wasn't your fault, B. It was mine. I just got so caught up in business, I lost track of family. I didn't see what being inside that place was doing to him. And that's on me. Look... just give up, man. Ant, give me this alibi. You do that, we win. We go home. [Anthony] I sent word through Zulu to set up a meeting for you tonight. He's gonna pick you up and take you somewhere. This has to stay between us. No one can know. [sighs] Look, I ain't tryin' to roll nowhere with Zulu, man. You're gonna be good. You'll be good. [sighs] [engine shuts off] They're waiting for you inside. Who? [suspenseful music] Come in. Sit, sit, sit. Brian Nelson. Relax. Don't worry. Everything's gonna be okay. You want a drink or anything? -Water's cool. -Good, good. Benny, please get him a water. So, do you know who I am? Ah, yeah. Don Victor Luciano. Head of the Genovese crime family. [Luciano] Very good. I'm impressed. You did your homework. -[chuckles] -[sighs] Yeah. Now, damn Anthony, he can't keep his nose clean. I told him a million times, "You take care of family first." Now look at him. You know, I knew that kid since he was 17. I took him under my wing, I taught him everything I knew... because I saw his potential. And look at him now. [Brian] So let me get this straight. Anthony works for you? Yeah. Along with a lot of other people, but he was always my favorite. And it's a damn shame what happened to that whore wife of his. [sighs] So, why am I here? Anthony asked me to show you something, all right? Benny. Thank you. [speaking foreign language] -Okay. -Thank you. There we go. Okay, Brian Nelson. I need you to look at this very closely. -What am I looking at? -Yeah. Monthly, myself and the other four Dons from the western district, we meet and we discuss business. Now, we record these meetings for, like, a guarantee. It's a promise of mutual destruction. One of us goes down, we all go down, you understand? Okay. So, why are you showing me this? Because also at these meetings, we meet with our top distributers. See who that is? So it is impossible, Counselor, that your client could have been in two places at once, you understand? So, Anthony was meeting with you that night. Exactly. You're his alibi. That's right. So now you understand why no one can know about this, all right? This video can never be used as evidence and no one is ever gonna testify, because this meeting, it never took place, all right? And the only reason I'm telling you, is 'cause I have a soft spot for that kid and he tells me you two go way, way back? -Yeah. -Okay. [sighs] Anthony's innocent. That's right. Now you... we are counting on you, Counselor. Do everything you possibly can do to get our boy out of there. Because it is affecting his work and the other Dons are getting very impatient. He owes us a lot of money, you understand? And the Dons want me to go to collection. I'm the only one that are keeping them at bay. Do you understand? Understood. Great. You're free to go. Brian, thank you. Thanks. [suspenseful music] I take it the meeting was fruitful. So Anthony's innocent, which means somebody set him up. Glad we finally have your train on track, Mr. Nelson. [dramatic music] [engine revs] Come on, man. What now? What now? Jay don't like that little performance you pulled today in the courtroom, nigga. He gave your ass a time limit. -Time is up. -[Brian] Look. I just found out Anthony is innocent, all right? I ain't about to put a innocent man in jail -for the rest of his life. -[gun clicks] Come on, man. Well, in this case, there's no more need for you. I think Mr. Nelson is very much needed. Don't you, Mr. Nelson? This ain't got nothing to do with you, Zulu. Nah. This has everything to do with me. You good, Mr. Nelson? Yeah, I'm good. Here's a little message to Jay from Anthony. -What? -[gunshot] Man, come on, Zulu! Why would you do that? Now Jay is gonna be after me! If I didn't kill him, he would've killed you. I can't work like this, man. Anthony told me to back off your family. But you went over your head with some people who don't need you like Anthony needs you. You're gonna need protection. Consider it a favor. Go in the house. I'll clean this up. [Brian sighs] [grunts] [breathes heavily] You get what you needed? Yeah. Yeah, I did. So now what? Now we figure out who's trying to set you up. [scoffs] That's a long list. Yeah, don't I know. Luciano say anything else? Something about the Dons being impatient. Something about sending you to collections or something. Yeah. I still owe them. I just don't know how much it's gonna cost me after all this. I got their products stashed away. I just... I'll take care of it when I get outta here. What if you don't? [chuckles] Then I guess I'm screwed either way. So who benefits the most by you being up in here? Jay. He's been trying to push into my territory and get my connect for years. And that's exactly what I was thinking. [Anthony] Okay. But how do we get them to see that? You leave that up to me. I'll figure it out. Okay. All right. See you later. Keep your head up, man. You know, the funny thing about the law is, it's not about what you know. It's about what you can prove. [Brian] You know what else is funny? Shoot. A lot of people think I got into law for the money, but that's the furthest thing from the truth, you feel me? [chuckles] Well, why did you if it wasn't for the money? I mean, I guess I just saw how broken the system was. Yeah, you got that right. Something with men and women in jail because, you know, they got some crap plea deal or, you know, they couldn't afford an attorney or whatever, just nonsense. I guess, you know, I really got into law to help the people that the system has been victimizing. And like it or not, Anthony Santiago is their next victim. Okay, Brian. What do you wanna do? I think the third witness is our key. Without him, we ain't got nothing. Now the cops is thinking that Anthony got to him, but I don't know. I know Ant. He wouldn't do that. But who would do something like that is Jay and his people. So the witness went into hiding. Yup. It's time we gotta fish him out. Oh. Road trip. All right. Let's get it. Come on. [door opens] I haven't seen the son of a bitch in almost six weeks. Still ain't got a rent check. Guy's been ghost ever since the police stopped by looking for him. If y'all find him first, let him know he got two more weeks. After that, all this stuff is going to the trash. Hey, thanks again for, uh, for letting us take a look around. No problem. Just don't take nothing, huh? I don't want nobody come back asking me any questions. Yeah, we got you, bruh. Goddamn. Looked like your boy skipped town. [chuckles] But I mean, he kept it kinda clean. Yeah. All right. All right. Where would he...ah. Veronica Stuart. We got a name. Okay. Yo. I also got something interesting over here. Come here, Monte'. Check this out. Son of a bitch was a Peeping Tom. Yeah, Peeping Tom that can positively identify the real killer. You said Veronica's her name, right? Uh-hmm. Veronica Stuart. Hmm, I got an idea. Let's find this Veronica Stuart chick. Finding people is what I do. [sighs] [suspenseful music] [operator] 911, what's your emergency? [man] A man just shot two people across the street from me. [operator] And you witnessed this altercation how, sir? [man] From my living room window. [suspenseful music] [phone ringing] Yeah. [Monte'] I found the Veronica chick. Feel like taking a ride? Let's do it. [Brian sighs] You know, this chick was actually easy to find. It's like the cops weren't even looking for her. Yeah, personally, I don't even think the DA cared to find her. All right. Check it. You go knock on the front door. I'mma stay back here in case our perv wants to try to flee. All right. Good idea. [knocks on door] -Veronica, right? -[Veronica] Yeah. Come in. Yeah. Look, uh, your brother may be a witness to a possible-- Look, I'mma tell you like I told them cops that came here before you, I'm here by myself. I don't know where Kenny is and I don't know when he coming back, so. You can go ahead and get up out of here. Okay. Before I go, let me just see if I have a business card that I can get. [clatters] -[Brian] Kenny? Yo, Kenny! -Run, Kenny, run! [Brian] Monte', he's out back! Go get him! [suspenseful music] Hey, man. [grunting] [Brian] You good, Monte'? Oh, man. Just get him in the car. You didn't have to knock him out. God. Where are you about to take my brother? -[Monte'] Get back in the house. -Where's you about to-- Get in the house! Put your hands behind your back. Get in the car. Watch your foot. Oh, man. What kind of cops are you guys? Man, we're not cops. If you guys aren't cops, then who the hell are you? [Brian] That's probably something you should've tried to ask before you came running out your house like a maniac, man. God. I'm Brian Nelson, I'm the defense attorney for the Anthony Santiago case. Now we know that you're the one that made the 911 call that night. Now what you need to tell us is why you went into hiding. I had to. I had to. I'm gonna ask you one more time. Why did you run? Because the killer was knocking at my goddamn door. Yo, man, I'll watch him tonight. -Yeah. -[car engine starts] You may be seated. [Judge Gentry] Mr. Nelson, are you ready with your opening statement? Yes, Your honor. [Judge Gentry] Then let's proceed. [sighs] Ladies and gentlemen, today, not only am I going to prove that my client, Mr. Anthony Santiago, is innocent but I'm also going to present to you something that the police never even thought to search for. And that is the real monster who committed this heinous crime. Now I'm not saying that Anthony Santiago, a career criminal, is without sin, but then again, who is? Now I'm not asking you to like him. [scoffs] I don't even like him. But... personal feelings should have nothing to do with the facts. The fact is... this is an innocent man. I know that for a fact. And after today, you all will know as a fact as well that my client... is innocent. Thank you. [Judge Gentry] Okay, Mr. Nelson, call your first witness. Your Honor, the defense calls Mr. Harvey Lenox to the stand. Objection! The defense is attempting to put on a dog and pony show, Your Honor! Counselors, approach the bench. Your Honor, I can assure you that this witness is vital to prove my client's innocence. Really? Because I'm beginning to side with Ms. Beamon and I think this whole thing is beginning to look like an act. So either you drive your point home quickly or I'm gonna hold you in contempt for making a mockery of this court. Uh... Mr. Nelson, is there something more important than this case that you have to check your phone? Yes. Uh, actually, um, can I have a quick recess? -What? -On what grounds? I've just gotten a hold of some new evidence and I need to review it before I can, uh, present it. -Hmm. -All right. I'll allow it. Judge. Thirty-minute recess. [gavel bangs] [groans] [suspenseful music] [indistinct chatter] Hey, yo, what's going on? Hey! What's going on? Hey, my wife and my daughter is in there. -Sir. -Hey, what's up, man? Sir, there's only one victim in the car. It's a male victim. So there's no woman or child in that--in that vehicle? Sir, there's only one victim. [Brian] What? Do you know the victim, sir? I... Sir. -[phone rings] -Sir. Lynnette, hey. Just when I was starting to like you. You go do something stupid. Zulu, you lay one hand on my family and I promise you-- [Zulu] You promise me what? That you're gonna kill me, Mr. Nelson? That same threat again? At least make a threat that I can remotely pretend to entertain. [Karla sobbing] Look, I don't even gotta kill you. I'll make sure Anthony spends the rest of his life behind bars. You got me? You know what happens when you do that? [Lynnette] Let me go. I'm begging you. You know what happens. [Charlie] Come on, man. Leave us alone, man. -Leave us alone. -But to think you were just gonna take your family and run off into the sunset, I thought you were smarter than that, Mr. Nelson. Monte'. -Where's Monte'? -Monte' was the first warning. There won't be a second one. [gunshot] [suspenseful music] [Zulu] By the way, it wasn't easy getting the information out of him. He put up a good fight till the end. Monte' was a good friend. Hmm, I hate he had to go. I can't win. I just--I just can't win with you. Finish your job, Mr. Nelson, or I'll finish your family. -Okay. Okay. Just don't hurt-- -[screaming] -[gunshot] -No, no, no! No! Hello? Lyn? [Lynette] No. [sobs] No, Mr. Nelson. Didn't harm Lyn or Karla. See, I need them alive so you can finish your job, Mr. Nelson. But I can't say the same thing about Charlie. Consider that a favor. [exhales deeply] Now, finish your job. [groans] [suspenseful music] [police siren blares] What's up, B? He got my family, that's what's up! [guard] What's going on in here? Nothing at all, officer. Just a little misunderstanding with my case. -That's all. -Well, keep it down. Will do. You said he wasn't gonna touch my family. You promised me. And you said you were gonna get me out of here. I guess we're both liars. [exhales deeply] Monte' was my dawg, man. He ain't got nothing to do with this. Actually, Monte' had everything to do with this. He was the one that was planning your little getaway trip, right? Unfortunately, his resources were more loyal to money than to him. [sighs] -Charlie was innocent. -[Anthony chuckles] I guess with Charlie out of the way, you got a second chance. [scoffs] You're lucky that I don't drop this case and let you rot in here for the rest of your life. And you're lucky I don't put a bullet in your wife and make your kid watch. Don't you ever threaten me again, Brian. Now, let's cross this finish line together. You get your family back, you never have to see me again. [suspenseful music] Take a breath, Brian. [Judge Gentry] Mr. Nelson. -Mr. Nelson! -Yeah. Yeah. What's up? [Judge Gentry] Is everything all right? [sighs] Yeah. Everything is good. [Judge Gentry] All right. Defense, call your witness. Yeah. The defense would like to call Detective William Whitfield to the stand. Objection! Detective Whitfield is not listed on the witness list, Your Honor. Your Honor, Detective Whitfield and his partner, Detective Copeland, they both ran surveillance on my client. I'll allow it. Thank you, Your Honor. [suspenseful music] Place your left hand on the Bible. Do you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? I do. [suspenseful music] You know, it's, uh, interesting seeing you, hand on the Bible, taking a oath. Let me ask you something, Detective. Have you ever broken an oath before? [Melissa] Objection! Council is badgering the witness. It's his witness. Detective, how long did you follow my client, Mr. Santiago? I don't know, almost six months, I guess. -Six months? -Give or take. And, Detective, I believe that you once referred to my client as a "piece of scum drug lord," am I correct? Sounds like something I'd say. So, is it safe to say that you've had a bit of animosity with my client? I've been on the force for eight years. In that time, I've seen countless men, women, and children overdose on that crap that he sells. I've personally put away dozens of two-bit, petty drug pushers and they all say the same thing. They work for him. So, why didn't you ever arrest him and charge him? [chuckles] We tried multiple times. But because of people like you, counselor, we can never make anything stick. So, needless to say that you were highly motivated before your investigation to catch my client in a crime, correct? I was highly motivated to put scum like him behind bars where he belongs. So, Detective, you and your partner watched and surveilled my client and his wife, Candace, for six months? That's right. Learned a lot about him in that period of time, right? If you say so. And in all that time, you never found any substantial evidence of this drug empire or any illicit crime, or for that matter, nothing illicit at all, other than him owning a gun, correct? [suspenseful music] That's right. Until, miraculously, after your investigation was called off, the man, that you've been surveilling for the past six months, just so happens to murder his wife and her lover. Uh, no disrespect to the family of the bereaved, but thank God for small miracles. Otherwise, you wouldn't have found him, right? Who's to say? Now, the day that you served his wife, Candace Santiago, the warrant, you just happened to surprise her at her apartment, correct? I believe so. And after surveilling them for six months, you knew exactly when to serve the search warrant, which was, when my client, Mr. Santiago, was out of town, correct? It was strategic, yes. So, who took her keys? -What? -[Brian] Her house keys. Was it you or your partner? -I don't recall. -[Brian] So, one of you did take her house keys? Like I said, I don't recall. [Brian] What about the hoodie? -What hoodie? -[Brian] The hoodie that you say my client wore the night of the murders, was that also in the closet? -I don't recall. -Hmm. You don't recall. Detective, did you take video evidence of the search? Yes. We had one of our officers recording the search. And were you with that officer the entire time? No. I was, uh, searching through other areas of the condo. Other areas of the condo, meaning the alley where the weapon was found? Uh, yes. [Brian] So, Detective, did you and your partner remove the gun from the crime scene? No. We put the weapon back where we found it. See, now, that's hard to believe, Detective, because what I believe is that you and your partner actually removed the gun from the crime scene. [Melissa] Your Honor. Tread carefully, Mr. Nelson. See, what I believe, in six months... of trailing my client, frustration kicks in, you and your partner was far too annoyed, you can't pin anything on, you can't make anything stick. So, what do you do? You and your partner devise a plan. Plan to take him down. I mean, you had them habits memorized. You knew exactly where they would be, when they would be there. So, I think you used that search warrant not to search the residence, but to make an impression of the key, so that you'd get in, get the weapon, and get the hoodie. Then you had your team alter the security footage. You guys couldn't get my client on a significant enough drug charge, but double murder. Wow! That's better. Objection, Your Honor! Mr. Nelson, do not fling unfounded accusations in my courtroom! -Do you hear me? -I can assure you, Your Honor, they are not unfounded accusations, because I found the third witness. -The one person-- -[Melissa] What? [Brian] --who made the 911 call. Do you mind standing up, please? [Melissa] What? [indistinct chatter] [Judge Gentry] All right. Order. You see, good ol' Kenny here has a problem. He's a Peeping-Tom, who just so happened to be peepin' in on the night that my client's wife, Candace Santiago, and her lover were both gunned down. So, imagine his shock when after calling 911 to report a murder that he just witnessed, that the gunman actually shows up to his front door holding a badge! It was him! I've seen him kill them both! [Melissa] What? Your Honor, this is outrageous! You son of bitch! Yo! [Judge Gentry] Order! Order in the court! Come on, Gibson, you know you never seen me [indistinct] [Judge Gentry] Detain that man and his partner. Come on, man! He deserves to go down! You know he does! We did nothing wrong! [Judge Gentry] I want order in the court! Damn you, Nelson! I want this courtroom completely cleared! Court will come to order! Bailiff, take these man out immediately. -Yo, you was there, Nelson! -Get him out of here. You see what kind of animals him and his brother are. You know he deserves to go down, man! [Melissa] Wait, wait, wait. [Judge Gentry] The court will come to order! Hey! In light of today's disappointing and disgusting revelation, the court has no choice, but declare a mistrial, drop all charges against Mr. Santiago. He shall be released immediately. Case dismissed. I told you I was innocent. -I told you. -Yeah, you did. Hey, congratulations. Congrats, gent-- -Thank you. -You're welcome. -Thank you. -Thank you, brother. Hey. What's up, man, a deal is a deal. -Where is my family? -You're right. You came through like I knew you would. Here's the address where you can find your family. You mean to tell me you had this the whole time? What was I supposed to do? Give it to you in my cell? And then, what? Had these two idiots argue my case? Look, I have no doubt about it. Your family's safe. Come on, armano, no hard feelings. No. We ain't friends. Once I get my family back, you stay the hell away from us, all right? Have it your way. We made a great team, though. Give me a phone. Hurry up. Give me a phone. Yeah, it's me. No loose ends. [reporter] Come on, I've been out here for a while! -[woman] No! -Justice has been served. If you don't mind, I like to go home and wash this experience off. Excuse me. [reporter] Sir, question. [elevator dings] Lynette! Karla! -Karla! -[Karla] Dad! -[Lynette] Baby! -Sit down! No, no, no, no. -Sit down! -Oh, my God. Zulu, what you doing, man? This ain't supposed to go down like this. Weapon, Mr. Nelson. Zulu, I ain't strapped, all right? I'm just here to get my family, man. -Throw your weapon down now-- -Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. --Mr. Nelson or I will blow your daughter's brain. No, no, no, no. Wait, wait. -[Zulu] Now! -Listen to him, baby. -Listen to him. -[Brian] Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Here it is, all right? [gun clatters] Oh, my God. Look, dawg, this wasn't supposed to happen. Anthony said he was gonna let us all go, man. No. You weren't supposed to try and move them. You forced my hand, Mr. Nelson. -[Lynette] No, no, no. -Just like my hand -is forced now. -No. [Brian] Wait, wait, wait, wait. Anthony said, he said you wasn't gonna hurt my family, all right? [Zulu] You believed him? [chuckles] Just like you believed he was innocent, right? -[chuckles] -[Brian] What? Wait. He played you like a side chick, brother. What you trying to say, man? Anthony is innocent. You took me to Luciano's. I saw him on the tape. Come on, Brian, you know how easy it is to fake footage these days. So, this whole thing was a setup? You were never gonna get your family, Mr. Nelson. Come on, Zulu. [sighs] It's between me and you, all right? Let my family go. It's not personal, Mr. Nelson. It's just business. [gunshot] Go, go! Keys are in the car! Go, go now! -[screams] Oh, my God. -[Brian] Go, go, go! Come on, come on. [intense music] Dad! [intense music] Nel! Please come out. Please come out. -Please come out. -[gunshot] [screams] Oh, no. Please, please, help him. -It is him. -He's out. Dad! Look at me. Oh, you made it. Oh, my God. -Baby, are you okay? -I'm all right. -Yeah. I'm good. -Okay, slow down, slow down. -Watch your step. -We got you, we got you. Told you I can handle it. -You want a drink? -Yeah. I'll be right back. -[glasses clinks] -[phone rings] Excuse me. I have to take this. [phone rings] Yo. Yo, where you've been? I've been waiting three days for this call. Zoo. Zoo, you there? [Brian] Nah, Ant. This ain't Zulu, bruh. B, is that you? [scoffs] Yeah, it's me. Still alive. Goddamn. You're a resourceful motherfucker, aren't you? [Brian] No. Me and you is cut from the same cloth. Grew up in the same hood, you know me. I know how to handle my own. I see. Hey, well, good for you. Hey, no hard feelings, right? You know, we gotta do what we gotta do. [Brian] Yeah, I know. Business is business, right? Look, ain't no hard feelings, you was doing what you gotta do, but check this out. Now, I gotta do what I gotta do. You see, when you told me about your debt to Luciano, I thought, if you was taking his money, there's only one place that you will feel comfortable enough to stash it. All right. So, you found my stash. Good for you. Did you wanna trade? Hmm? Did you want a cut of the company? I'm a generous businessman. You tell me what you want and I'll work it out. [Brian sighs] I'm sorry, Ant. See, ain't nothing to work out 'cause I don't got your money no more. Yeah. I think I found somebody that can make better use of it. You remember Jay, right? [intense music] Motherfucker! [Brian] Yeah. He went over there and paid your debt, and took your seat at the table, which you haven't had in a while. You see, you ain't even been to Luci's in a minute. Before I put a bullet in Zulu's head, he told me that the footage was fake and that you couldn't have been there, 'cause you was too busy killing your wife. So, what now, B, huh? You gonna arrest me? Turn me in? You got the cops with you? [chuckles] [Brian] Nah. I just wanted to hear you admit it. See, you took my family. You took my wife from me. And you was guilty. I just couldn't figure out why the third witness would lie. You'd be surprised what a man will do for someone he loves. [Brian] It's over, Ant. Over? [chuckles] Nah, it ain't over. See, we're just getting started, you and I, B. This is step A. We gotta go all the way to B. You know what I'm about to do to you? I'm about to send so many shooters to your door, you're gonna think they're using your house for target practice.
