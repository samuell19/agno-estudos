- [Announcer] Julie Harris in The Belle of Amherst. Produced by Mike Merrick and Don Gregory. Written by William Luce. Directed by Charles S. Dubin. One of America's greatest poets, Emily Dickinson was virtually unknown during her lifetime. Although she was a shy recluse, she wrote about life as one who had fully experienced it, and understood the joys and sorrows of the human heart. And now, Act I. [audience applauding] - This is my introduction: black cake. It's my own special recipe. Forgive me if I'm frightened. I never see strangers, and hardly know what I say. My sister, Lavinia, Vinnie is younger than I. She says that I tend to to wander back and forth in time, so you must bear with me. I was born December 10th, 1830, which makes me 53. Welcome to Amherst. My name is Emily Elizabeth Dickinson. Elizabeth is for my aunt, Elizabeth Currier. She's Father sister. Oh, how the trees stand up straight when they hear Aunt Libby's little boots come bumping into Amherst. She's the only male relative on the female side. [audience laughing] Dear, Aunt Libby. But, but I don't use my middle name anymore, since I became a poet. Professor Higginson, the literary critic, doesn't think that my poems are... But, no matter. I have had seven poems published, anonymously, to be sure, so you see why I prefer to introduce myself to you as a poet. Here in Amherst, I'm known as Squire Edward Dickinson's half-cracked daughter. Well, I am. The neighbors can't figure me out. I don't cross my father's ground, to any house or town. I haven't left the house in years. The soul selects her own society then shuts the door. Why should I socialize with village gossips? Oh, there goes one of them now. It's Henrietta Sweetser. Everyone knows Henny. She'd even intimidate the antichrist. Oh, look at her. She looks more like a jar of sweetmeats every day. Now, she's strolling by the house, trying to catch a glimpse of me. Oo! And would you like that? So, I give them something to talk about. I dress in white, all year round, even in the winter. Bridal white, Henny calls it. Dear, dear, dresses in bridal white, she does, every day of the blessed year, year in and year out. Disappointed in love as a girl, I hear. Oh, poor creature. Oh, so very sad. And her sister, Lavinia, spinster, too. Didn't you know? Oh, yes. Stayed unmarried just to be at home and take care of Miss Emily. Two old maids in that big house, what a lonely life to shut yourself away from good people like us. [dismayed whistle] Indeed. You should see them come to the house bearing gifts and craning their necks, trying to see over Vinnie's shoulder, 'cause I'm too fast for them. I've already run up the stairs, two steps at a time. And I hide there until they leave. You can imagine what they make of that. Oh, one old lady came to the door the other day to get a peek inside and I surprised her by opening the door myself. And [startled gasp] she stammered something about looking for a house to buy. To spare the expensive of moving, I directed her to the cemetery. [audience laughing] Oh, the cake. Well, I do all the baking here at Homestead. I even banged the spice for this cake. My father always raved about my baking. He would eat no cake or bread but mine. Mm, it's lovely. No, no, it's easy to make. The recipe? Of course. Now, I'll go slowly. It's black cake. It's two pounds of flour, two pounds of butter, two pounds of sugar, 19 eggs, five pounds of raisins, one and a half pounds of citron, one and a half pounds of currants, one half pint of brandy. Well, I never use Father's best. One half pint molasses, two nutmegs, five teaspoons of cloves, mace, cinnamon, two teaspoons of soda, and two good pinches of salt. Now, you beat the butter and sugar together, and then you add the 19 eggs, one at a time. And this is very important: without beating. Then you beat the mixture again, and add the brandy alternately with the flour, and soda, and salt, and spices that you've sifted together, and then, the molasses. And now, take your five pounds of raisins, and your three pounds of currants and citron, and gently sprinkle in all eight pounds. Slowly, now, as you stir, and bake it about, well, about three hours if you use cake pans, or if you use a milk pan, as I do, you better leave it in the oven six or seven hours. [audience chortling] And everybody loves it. I hope you will too. Thank you for asking me. Sometimes, I bake one for a neighbor and I enclose a short note, which is usually so obscure that nobody can understand it. I hear my little notes are becoming collectors' items in the village. People compare them to see who has the strangest one. Oh, excuse me. We must... We must be careful what we say. No bird resumes its egg. That'll keep them guessing. [audience laughing] I'm told one woman in Amherst is imitating me, now. Well, it's probably Clarissa Cartwright. Well, that's just what Amherst needs: another eccentric. Oh, I do have fun with them, my menagerie. I guess people in small towns need their local characters, and for Amherst, that's what I am. But, you know something? I enjoy the game. I've never said this to anyone before, but I'll tell you. I do it on purpose. The white dress, the seclusion, it's all deliberate, but my brother, Austin, he knows. He says, "Emily, stop your posing." Austin knows me, through and through, as no one else does. Father and Mother never understood me, and Vinnie... Well, Vinnie doesn't really know me, either. Austin and I are unlike most other people, and are therefore more dependent on each other for delight, but I do think, sometimes the stories about me distress him. Well, in a way, the stories are true. I believe in truth, but I think it can be slanted just a little. Do you know what I'm saying? Tell all the truth, but tell it, slant. Success in circuit lies, too bright for our infirm delight, the truth's superb surprise as lightning to the children eased. With explanation kind, the truth must dazzle gradually or every man be blind. Words are my life. I look at words as if they were entities, sacred beings. There are words to which I lift my hat when I see them sitting on a page. Sometimes I write one with circumference, and I look at its outlines until it starts to glow, brighter than any sapphire. I hesitate which word to take when I write a poem. Circumference. A poet can choose but a few words, and they have to be the chiefest words, the best words. A word is dead when it is said, some say. I say it just begins to live that day. If I read, well, Keats, Shelley, Shakespeare, Mrs. Browning, Emily Bronte, oh, what an afternoon for Heaven when Bronte entered there. They make my whole body so cold. No fire can ever warm me. I know that is poetry. Have you ever felt that way? If I feel, physically, as if the top of my head were taken off, I know that is poetry. These are the only ways I know it. Is there any other way? My friend, Helen Jackson, oh, you'd love her. She's moved to Colorado. Now, Helen is a fine scholar of words and a well-known writer. She has the facts, but not the phosphorescence. Oh, phosphorescence. Now there's a word to lift your hat to. Can you spell it? To find that phosphorescence, that light within, that's the genius behind poetry. We have an Irish girl who's been with us a long time, and I was here at tea yesterday, and she asked me how to spell genius. Well, why do you ask, Maggie? Oh, no leave the tray, dear. Oh, writing to your brother. I see. And whom are you describing? Me? [soft laughter] Oh, Maggie. Well, then I guess I better spell it for you. G-E-N-I-U-S, genius. Oh, don't ask me that. I don't know what it means. No one knows that, Maggie, no one. Thank you, dear. Do you know, every one of you is, to me, a poem. You, and you, and you, each one, a rare creation. And I suppose that's why I love you, and you love me, whether we realize it or not. I discovered that secret a long time ago about the souls of people, and I thought that being a poem one's self precluded the writing of poems, but I saw my mistake. The poet lights the lamp and then goes out himself, but the light goes on and on, essences are marked for... No, that's not the best word. Um, labeled. That's better. Essences are labeled for immortality. If I can stop one heart from breaking, I shall not live in vain. If I can ease one life the aching, or cool one pain, or help one fainting robin onto his nest again, I shall not live in vain. People find it hard to believe that I had a normal childhood. [audience titters] Well, they visualize instead a miniature version of me as I am now, a pint-sized little Emily, dressed all in white and lisping riddles and aphorisms in baby talk. [audience laughing] And, of course, hiding from the family. Well, I guess I'm to blame for that false impression. Actually, at 15, I was a very typical Amherst girl. I went to dances and giggled my way through classes, and quilting bees and scores of parties. I was trying very hard to believe that I was a ravishing beauty, and I was infatuated with one dashing young man after another. Unfortunately, they didn't know it, or if they did, they were smarter than I gave them credit for. Oh, and I... I sent valentines. Abiah? Oh, Abiah, my dearest girlfriend, will you you be my valentine? Oh, I would love to send you a bouquet if I had an opportunity, and you could press it, and write under it, the last flowers of summer. Wouldn't it be poetical? And you know that is what young ladies aim to be nowadays: poetical. I am growing handsome, very fast indeed. I expect I shall be the belle of Amherst when I reach my 17th year. Oh, I don't doubt that I shall have perfect crowds of admirers at that age. [delighted squeal] And at dances, how I shall delight to make them await my bidding. And with what delight shall I witness their suspense while I make my final decision? Oh, James Francis Billings. Excuse me, mother. Oh, what handsome whiskers. How've you been? Oh, yes, isn't it a wonderful party? Oh, thank you. It's a Godey's Lady Book pattern. Yes, isn't it? July is such a glorious month. I'm well, thank you. Oh, thank you. Oh, yes, delicious refreshments. Oh, did you sampler the rhubarb cupcakes? I baked them myself. Oh, you don't like rhubarb. Well, a lot of people don't like rhubarb, I guess. Oh, my, yes, I adore cooking. I can't get enough of cooking. Mother says that any man I marry will... My sister? Oh, Lavinia's well. Yes, I'll tell her. Mr. Billings, how do you like going to school at Ipswich Cemetery? Seminary? [audience laughing] Mr. Billings? Seems Mr. Billings found the pretty girl in yellow. Well, Father's house and my garden, this is my world. And for my companions, I have the hills and the sundown, and my dog, Carlo, large as myself that my father bought me. Now these, these are better than beings because they know but don't tell, and the noise in the pool at noon excels my piano. You see, I never had to go anywhere to find my paradise. I found it all right here, the only world I wanted, right here in Amherst, Massachusetts. Massachusetts. There's a word to lift your hat to. Paradise is no journey because it is within, but for that very cause, it's the most arduous of journeys. I travel the road into my soul all the time. I dwell in possibility, a fairer house than prose, more numerous of windows, superior for doors, of chambers as the cedars, impregnable of eye, and for an everlasting roof, the gables of the sky, of visitors the fairest, for occupation this, the spreading wide my narrow hands to gather paradise. Oh, nature is the highest art. Don't you think? I mean, just to see the summer sky is poetry. Summer. The orchard is full of blue jays. To see them follow the hose for a drop of water is a touching sight they won't take it if I hand it to them. They run and shriek as if they were being assassinated. But, oh, to steal it, that is bliss. The sun beat down so today. I think everything will get ripe so it can be autumn tomorrow. Oh, how I looked forward to the beginning of school each year. My girlfriends and I had such times together. Abiah Root, Sarah Tracy, Abby Wood, Emeline Kellogg and Emily Fowler. There were so many Emilys at the academy. Our teachers couldn't keep us straight. Social graces with Miss Woodbridge. One and two and knees straight, girls. One and two and shoulders back. Three and four and very good, Miss Dickinson. Thank you, Miss Woodbridge. I never knew how to tell time by the clock, 'til I was 15. Father thought he had taught me, but I didn't understand, was afraid to say I didn't and afraid to ask anyone lest he should know. Can you imagine never knowing what time it was? Thank goodness for twilight. Father never kissed us goodnight in his life. Oh, I know he loved us, but he was so austere. Why, he hardly ever smiled. I remember the day we went to the photographer to have this picture taken. That poor photographer. He was trying to be cordial and put Father at ease, and he said, "Squire Dickinson, "could you smile a little, please?" Father said, "I am smiling." [audience laughing] You see, he looks like a bear. Father didn't even approve Santa Claus, and all such prowling gentlemen. Father was the only one in the house to say damn. Well, someone in every family ought to say damn, of course, and when he said it, he meant it. If his newspaper was ever misplaced, "Damn!" No one else was allowed to say it. It was absolutely forbidden. Well, Father forbade many things. When my sister Vinnie was a girl, oh, this, this is Vinnie. When Vinnie was a girl, she enjoyed showing off her pretty white shoulders by wearing her summer frocks quite low, about, well... Well, about here. Well, it was the fashion. And then she would languish about the house, looking dreamy-eyed, and primping in front of the mirror, and running to the window every time a boy walked by the house. Hello, Benjamin. And Father could take only so much of this, and then he would bark at her, "Lavinia, don't be so affected! Put on a shawl!" And poor Vin would flounce dramatically out of the room, stomp up the steps to her room, and she slammed the door, bang! She pouted the rest of the day. The trouble was, she was even prettier when she pouted, but Father was, oh, so proper, and very demanding, inflexible. That's why any show of leniency or understanding on his part would disarm us completely. I remember when he discovered that I was writing until two or three o'clock in the morning. Oh, Father, I thought you were asleep. No, I didn't notice the time. Oh, two o'clock, is it that late? Well, it's the only time when the house is quiet except for Vinnie and she snores like a poker and shovel and pair of tongs. Oh, yes, Father, I know you have a rule about early rising, but I haven't missed a morning, have I? Oh. Tired? I do? Well, I was writing. Good night, Father. Oh, just a poem, Father. Now? Out loud? To Make a Prairie. Prairie, Father. To make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee. One clover and a bee, and reverie. The reverie alone will do if bees are few. Another one? Oh, well, yes, I have, Father. I keep my finished ones in here. Excuse me. I'll tell you how the sun rose, a ribbon at a time. The steeples swam in amethyst. The news, like squirrels, ran. The hills untied their bonnets, the bobolinks begun. Then I said softly to myself, that must have been the sun. But how he set, I know not. There seemed a purple stile that little yellow boys and girls were climbing all the while to when they reached the other side, a dominie in gray put gently up the evening bars and led the flock away. Cancel the rule for me? Then I can sleep late in the morning? Oh, thank you, Father. You see what I mean? The first time we parted, 1847. I was 16. I graduated from Amherst Academy and entered Mount Holyoke Seminary for Girls, run by a dragon. [audience laughing] Oh, I wanted to tell you about her. Mary Lyon was the head of the school, a noble lady sometimes known as the Dragon. Well, I liked Miss Lyon, even though she laid down strict rules for her girls. Unfortunately, her main concern was for our spiritual health. And we were classified in three categories. Either we were professed Christians. that was Jane Gridley's group, or we had hope, and that was Olivia Coleman's group, or we were without hope. And naturally, I was in charge of that group. But, after Miss Lyon made a vigorous appeal for converts, the without hopes were reduced, considerably. Oh, I'll never forget it. One evening, we impenitent girls were invited by Miss Lyon to a meeting in room B, the dungeon, and we were told to bring the Bible. I told Olivia that this would happen, that Ms. Lyon would ask everyone who desired to be employed in service to Christ to rise at the meeting and declare herself. Courage, Emily. Good evening, Miss Lyon. I'm sorry, Miss Lyon, but I can't rise. I know I'm the only one left without hope, but well, the spirit hasn't moved me yet, ma'am. Oh, yes, ma'am, I do desire to be good. Yes, Miss Lyon, I do want to please my parents, but I'm not yet persuaded to be a Christian. Oh, I'm grateful for your offer of mercy, ma'am. Yes, I know the world is sinful and wicked, but well, the path of duty doesn't look... Well, it doesn't look very attractive to me. Oh, but I have read the Bible, Miss Lyon, old and new Testaments. Well, at first I thought it was an arid book, but then I found it wise and a bit merry. [audience laughing heartily] Merry, yes, ma'am. M-E-R-R-Y. She did look like a dragon. I think it was the nose. [chuckling] But I must not laugh at Miss Lyon, for I believe she has a good heart, and that is the principal thing nowadays, isn't it? I didn't return to Holyoke the following year. You might say I wore out my welcome with Miss Lyon, and Father wanted me home. Besides, he said it was for my help, but I think Father was lonely. Austin was soon to leave for college and Father couldn't bear to have the family separated. More than one away at a time was too much for him. All the while Austin was at home, they did nothing but fight. But the minute they were separated, they became devoted friends. Oh, this, this is Austin. Isn't he handsome? There was no one living for whom my father had such respect as for my brother, Austin, but nobody missed him more than I. Austin, the coach is here. And each time he left, I stood out there in the road and watched the stagecoach disappear, I waited for Austin to turn around. I had to be sure he saw me. It was almost a superstition with me. I thought that if he didn't see me as the stagecoach went behind the hill, that we'd never meet again. So, it could be raining or snowing, but there I stood, waiting for his last look through that little window in the coach. Ah! Oh, those times seem far off, a great way, as things we did when children. I wish we were children now, and the nails hung full of coats again, the chairs hung full of hats, and the umbrellas were all in a row, and I could count the slippers under the kitchen chair. I wish we were always children. How to grow up? I don't know. As far back as childhood, we always met for morning prayers in this parlor. Everyone was religious in the family, except me. And they addressed an eclipse every morning whom they called our Father. I can still hear Father say in a most militant way, "I say unto you." It always gave me a chill. Why is religion made so grim? And so dull? And why should we be made to feel guilty? Sermons, sermon, sermons. I only heard one sermon that I ever really liked and that was when Reverend Dwight preached on unbelief. Sermons on unbelief always did attract me. It was on a sweltering July Sabbath that I finally decided to stop attending church altogether. Well, I was old enough to make that decision. I was almost 30. I came home very hot and faded, having witnessed a couple of baptisms, and three admissions to church, and a supper of the Lord, and several other minor transactions, including the sermon wheezed by Reverend Leland. [mimics harsh coughing] Make a joyful noise [loud snuffling] unto the Lord, all ye lands, and come before his presence with singing. Singing, indeed. Oh, poor Reverend Leland. Well, some keep the Sabbath going to church. I keep it staying at home, with a bobolink for a chorister and an orchard for a dome. Some keep the Sabbath in surplice. well, I just wear my wings, and instead of tolling the bell for church, our little sexton sings. God preaches, a noted clergyman and the sermon is never long, so instead of getting to Heaven, at last, I'm going, all along. In the name of the bee and of the butterfly, and of the breeze, amen. [audience clapping] When the family went to church, I was never alone. God was sitting right there, looking into my very soul. How do you spend your evenings? Vinnie and I read the Springfield Republican every night. I read the news aloud while she sews, and Vinnie has an odd liking for those stories of accidents where trains meet each other unexpectedly, or gentlemen in factories have their heads cut off, quite informally, and the author relates these in such a sprightly way that Vinnie finds the stories quite attractive. She was disappointed last night because there weren't more accidents. Oh, here's one you'll love, Vinnie. Train hits local woman on Millriver trestle. Cornelia Snell, 54 was killed... Snell, was killed last Wednesday by the Belchertown Express as she struggled vainly to free her foot from the railroad switch. Her foot, Vinnie! Engineer Grover W Putnam declared, "By the time I saw the poor lady "and her dog, it was too late." Oh, yes, Vinnie, she leaves her husband, Noah L Snell and eight children. Ah, eight little Snells. Oh, the dog survived, he jumped clear. No, Vinnie, the casket was closed, she was hit by a train. What? Oh, services were held already, it says, last Friday. Hambly and Son, in Springfield, some 60 attended, Her children are planting an evergreen in her memory near the spot. Ah, isn't that sweet, Vinnie? [shuddering gasp] I wonder why she didn't take off her shoe. Well, I suppose she tried, but trains are so fast these days. Vinnie, do you, Vin? She's asleep. Vinnie wears white cotton stockings even though everyone else is wearing black. Did you notice? She thinks her feet will be poisoned by the dye in the black stockings. Buffy, you one-eyed monsters, you leave my yarn alone! Oh, Vinnie's one big passion is cats. Unfortunately, mine is birds, and now she has a new cat, Drummy-Doodles. It catches a mouse an hour. We call it the minute hand. Vinnie thinks her cats are a little lower than the angels. I mean, a china saucer for each one, indeed. If she had her way, they'd dine on sherry and hummingbird cutlets, every night. It's so weird and so vastly mysterious. Vinnie sleeps by my side, and her care is in some sort, motherly, but if we'd come up for the first time from two wells, where we had been bred, her astonishment would be greater at some things I say, or, like Father was. Mother was different. Mother didn't care for thought. Consequently she never listened to what I said. We all live together, like friendly, and absolute monarchs here at Homestead, each in his own domain and yet, I was the slightest in the house. I took the smallest room. At night, my little lamp and book, and one geranium. So stationed, I could catch the mint that never ceased to fall, and just my basket, let me think I'm sure that this was all. I never spoke unless addressed, and then, 'twas brief and low. I could not bear to live aloud. The racket shamed me so. And if it had not been so far and any one I knew were going, I had often thought how noteless, I could die. Oh, do you read the Atlantic Monthly? In the April issue, 1862, an article appeared, inviting young writers to submit their work. Charge your style with life, said the author, Thomas Wentworth Higginson. But this was what I was waiting for, and so agreed. Oh, Sue is my sister-in-law. She married Austin, and we spent days trying to find the right poems to send, and Sue thought that Father would disapprove. She was the only one who understood my need to write. No, no, Sue. He'll approve soon enough when he sees that my poems bring honor to his name. Look, Sue, try to find, try to find one poem that's a good contrast with these three, and I'll finish the letter, but I'm not going to sign it. Isn't that humble of me? Oh, of course, but on a card slipped into the poems. Oh, well, he'll find it. He'll look for it. Emily... Oh, E Dickinson. Mysterious? It is provocative, isn't it? It ought to whet his curiosity, I'd say. And then when he reads my poems, won't he go wild? Oh, Sue, do you think we ought to send more than four? I mean, how about six, or 10? No, read that one again, Sue. No, how about: the pedigree of honey does not concern the bee, clover any time, to him, is aristocracy. No? A bird came down the walk, he did not know I saw. He bit an angleworm in halves, and ate the fellow, raw. Oh, no, Sue, no bird poems. Oh dear, oh dear. Safe in Their Alabaster Chambers. Safe in their alabaster chambers, untouched by morning and untouched by noon, sleep the meek members of the resurrection. Rafter of satin, roof of stone, light laughs the breeze in her castle of sunshine. Babbles the bee in a stolid ear. Pipe the sweet birds in ignorant cadence. Ah, what sagacity perished here. Grand go the years in the crescent above them. Worlds scoop their arcs, and firmaments row. Diadems drop and doges surrender, soundless as dots on a disk of snow. That's the fourth. Mr. Thomas Wentworth Higginson, The Atlantic Monthly. Oh, what was that address? Washington and School Street, Boston, Massachusetts. Ah! Oh, now we must throw away these scraps of paper. I mean, no one must know that the famous and mysterious E Dickinson writes second and third drafts of her letters. Oh, look how long I've kept you. Oh, Austin will be waiting for his dinner. Thank you, my darling. I'll let you know the minute I hear. Mr. Higginson answered my letter but not in the way I had hoped. I thanked him for the surgery. It was not as painful as I supposed and he did ask to see more poems, and I sent them. I wrote to him often. I even began calling him my preceptor, and myself, his scholar. Eight years of correspondence. Eight years of putting my hopes on the shelf, and then when I was 40, the incredible happened. Thomas Wentworth Higginson was coming to Amherst! Face-to-face at last! Now, now, we can really accomplish something. I look forward to meeting with you and will come to you directly from my visit with President Stearns at the college. He says the 15th. Oh, dear friend, you are not aware that you saved my life. I will be at home and glad. I've been so afraid. It's like being terrified of midnight when I was a child, but now it's time to smooth the hair, and get the dimples ready, and wonder we could care for that old faded midnight that frightened but an hour. He's coming to Amherst at last. It seems I'm going to be famous. Oh, Sue, I have the most glorious news. Wait 'til you hear! He's coming. He's coming! He's coming! [audience applauding] - [Announcer] The Belle of Amherst will continue in a moment. And now, Act II of The Belle of Amherst, starring Julie Harris. - Maggie? Maggie, watch for the coach! I'll be upstairs. Oh, surely, this is the day! Maggie? Maggie, when he comes, ask him to wait in the hall. Oh, it's almost time. Oh, what to say? Mr. Higginson, how is Mrs. Higginson? Good noon, Professor Higginson, how is Mrs. Higginson? Oh, enchanted, Mr. Higginson. How is sweet Mrs. Higginson? Another confinement? Oh! Oh, sherry, it's Father's best. Oh, yes, August is a glorious month. Please. [prolonged coy laughing] Oh, Mr. Higginson, how droll. I wish I'd thought of that. How witty! Oh, my favorite books, well, let me think. Jane Eyre, I loved, and the Mill on the Floss, and of course, your inspired novel, Malbone. How did you do it? [audience laughing] A coach! Oh, it's stopping. Oh. He's taller than I thought, and so imposing. Maggie. Maggie, the door! Oh! [nervous murmuring] Courage, Emily. Mr. Higginson? And I, to meet you. How long are you going to stay? Well, what I mean is why has it taken eight years? Oh, I know you've been so busy and then you were away in the war. The Civil War, wasn't it? War, to me is so oblique, I can't grasp it. My wars are laid away in books, but now, to the real purpose of your visit. I've been waiting to hear from your own lips what you're planning for my poems. I have them all right here, all the ones I've sent you. These, these are the first four, And these are the later ones. I've bound them together. Oh, and this one, I'll Tell You How the Sun Rose, this was Sue's choice. Oh, Sue is my sister-in-law. That's her house, over there. It's not what I would've chosen but perhaps for publication, it's more appropriate, more appealing to the reading public. But you will be the best judge of that, Mr. Higginson, and I have many that you might feel would be better for a printed collection, many, oh, so many, over 1,000, enough for several volumes, I should think. I would prefer Morocco bound. Oh, but Mr. Higginson, I must apologize. I'm not giving you a chance to say anything. Could you tell me how to grow, or is it unconveyed like melody or witchcraft? Oh, please, feel free to choose the poems you think are best for a book. And as for publishers, well, I rely solely on your judgment. After all, you are my preceptor. But... But my meter is... New, it's experimental, not spasmodic. Bad rhymes? Oh, no, you don't understand what I'm trying to, if only I could explain. Uncontrolled? But Mr. Higginson, when I... When I tried to organize, my little force explodes, but surely a publisher will recognize. I mean, surely. A great hope fell. Oh, you heard no noise. The ruin was within. Oh, cunning wreck that told no tale and let no witness in. A not admitting of the wound until it grew so wide that all my life had entered it and there were troughs beside. A closing of the simple lid that opened to the sun, until the tender carpenter perpetual nail it down. Well, I still send him poems. But always from his polite replies, I get the uneasy feeling that they end up in some dusty drawer in his office. Well, I can talk about this now, but when I heard Higginson's words, I became ill. But then I understand another poet met with the same disappointing reception from Professor Higginson, but he didn't give up as I did. He got his poems published somehow. His book has gone through nine editions, already, and Professor Higginson says that his poems are absolutely scandalous. His name: Walt Whitman. Perhaps no one will ever read my poems. They seem to me like an undelivered letter lost in transit. Destiny is strange. Going to be famous. If fame belonged to me, I couldn't escape her. And if she didn't, well, the longest day would pass me on the chase, and the approbation of my dog would forsake me, then. My barefoot rank is better. It's not that I haven't had fame of sorts. One October, my rye and Indian bread won second prize at the cattle show. Second prize was 75 cents, and in case you missed the newspaper, my heliotropes won honorable mention. I'm nobody. Who you are you? Are you nobody, too? Then there's a pair of us. Don't tell, they'd banish us, you know. How dreary to be somebody, how public like a frog, to tell your name the livelong day to an admiring bog. Vinnie always said that my withdrawal into seclusion was only a happen. I suppose my not marrying was only a happen, too. Oh, I know I'm plain and small like the wren, but my hair is bold like the chestnut burr, and my eyes, like the sherry in the glass that the guest leaves. I never had but one picture taken of myself. It's not among those. Oh. This daguerrotype, when I was 17. Plain, now that's a word not to lift your hat to. Oh, you see this neck ribbon? That was Vinnie's touch. She made it. Oh, I know what people say. Poor Emily, the only kangaroo among the beauties. Is it any wonder I keep it in a drawer? But I'll have you know that plain or not, I had more than one suitor. They were all married, and older than I, but there was really only one. Only one. It was in Philadelphia, years ago that I first saw Charles Wadsworth. I was 24. I hadn't meant to tell you this. Vinnie and I had visited Father in Washington while he was a congressman, and on the way home, we stayed two weeks with the Colemans in Philadelphia. We attended the Presbyterian Church where Mr. Wadsworth was minister. When I first laid eyes on him that Sunday morning, it was as if Heaven's own lightening struck me. Here before me was a Christlike man. He seemed like Gabriel standing before the congregation. When I walked out of the church into the brilliant morning, the light in my heart was shining even brighter. His voice haunted me. I couldn't shake off the enchantment. Even after we returned to Amherst, and I wrote to him, well, at first, hesitant, a cautious letter asking about spiritual things: redemption, immortality, and finally, in his answers, I detected a response not unlike my own emotions, but, well, more subtle, sensitive, hidden. It's an exquisite experience to love someone in a bodiless way, like fleshless lovers, forever one. Such love was the limit of my dream. It was the focus of my prayer. It made me different from before, as if I breathed superior air. Oh, wild nights, wild nights! Were I with thee wild nights should be our luxury! Futile, the winds, to a heart in port. Done with the compass. Done with the chart! Rowing in Eden. Ah, the sea! Might I but moor tonight, in thee? I called him my master. I spoke with him only twice in my life, 20 years apart. The first time in 1860, and he came to me again, three years ago. Vinnie came running to get me. She said, "A gentleman with a deep voice "wants to see you, Emily." Again, his voice is at the door. I feel the old degree. I hear him ask the servant for such an one as me. I take a flower as I go, my face to justify. He never saw me in this life. I might surprise his eye. I cross the hall with mingled steps. I, silent, pass the door. I look on all this world contains, just his face, nothing more. Where did you come from? Ah, the pulpit to the train. But why didn't you tell me you were coming, so I could have it to hope for? Oh, you didn't know yourself. You just came. How long was your journey? 20 years. [soft giggle] Yes, it has been that long hasn't it? Oh, but I am older too, Master, but the love is the same, and so big that it scares me. Oh, no. No, say I may wait for you. I waited a long time, Master, but I can wait more, 'til my hazel hair is dappled and you carry the cane. Then I can look at my watch, and if the day is too far declined, then we can take our chances for Heaven. Master, open your life wide and take me in forever, and I will be your best little girl. Nobody else will see me but you, but that's enough. I shall not want anymore. I'm sorry. I know I cannot live with you. It would be life, And life is over there behind the shelf. The sexton keeps the key to putting up our life, his porcelain, like a cup discarded of the housewife. So, we must keep apart, you, there, I, here, with just the door ajar that oceans are, and prayer, and that pale sustenance, despair. And I am so moved just to look in your face while you look in mine. Will you come to Amherst again? You can't? No, I understand. Yes, I am content. I shall always be content now. Goodbye, Master. It's easier to look behind at a pain than to see it coming. When the best is gone, I know that other things are not of consequence. The heart wants what it wants, or else it does not care. Last year, in April, my master died. Will there really be a morning? Is there such a thing as day? Could I see it from the mountains if I were as tall as they? Has it feet like waterlilies? Has it feathers like a bird? Is it brought from famous countries of which I have never heard? Oh, some scholar! Oh, some sailor! Oh, some wise man from the skies, please to tell a little pilgrim where the place called morning lies! Yes, I still write poetry but not as much as I use to. There are so few listeners, and those who should be the best listeners, like Professor Higginson, are deaf. But even yet, when I see a tall, pale snowstorm stalking through the fields and bowing at my window, I find I must translate my feelings into poetry. Sometimes I put both hands on the windowpane and try to think how birds fly, and imitate and fail. I could make a balloon of a dandelion, but the fields are gone. I talk of all these things with my dog and his eyes grow meaning, and his shaggy feet keep a slower pace. Animals have a natural, simple wisdom, except, chickens, of course. At present, we have 24 invalid hens who do nothing so vulgar as lay an egg. [audience laughing] But I do remember one Christmas, when the cats came to the door with Santa Claus. And the cats washed themselves in the open air without chilling their tongues. Atmospherically, it was the most beautiful Christmas on record. Maggie gave her hens checks for potatoes, and each of that cats had a gilt-edge bone, and the horses had both new blankets from Boston. It was a lovely Christmas. Vinnie's cats leave the chickens alone. They're good about that, but in summer, they're forever catching snakes, and carrying them into the kitchen. And poor Vin is deathly afraid of snakes. Oo! When I hear scream or crash from the kitchen, I know what's happened. When we were little, I used to hide behind a tree with a garter snake in my hand, and when Vinnie'd come along, I'd wave it in her face, and chase her all over the orchard. Well, Austin did it, too. I love those little green ones. You know the ones that slide around by your shoes in the grass and make it rustle with their elbows. A narrow fellow in the grass occasionally rides. You may have met him. Did you not? His notice, sudden is. The grass divides as with a comb. A spotted shaft is seen, and then it closes at your feet and opens further on. He likes a boggy acre, a floor too cool for corn. Yet when a boy, and barefoot, I more than once, at noon have passed, I thought, a whip-lash, unbraiding in the sun. And, stooping to secure it, it wrinkled and was gone. Now, several of nature's people I know, and they know me. I feel for them a transport of cordiality. But never met this fellow, attended or alone, without a tighter breathing and zero at the bone. Did I tell you that my father loved animals? Well, he did. He had beautiful horses. During his last winter, that was nine years ago, there were several snowstorms, and the birds were so frightened and cold, they sat outside the kitchen door. And Father went over to the barn in his slippers and brought back a breakfast of grain for each, and he hid himself while he scattered it lest it embarrass them. Ignorant of the name and fate of their benefactor, their descendants are singing this afternoon. During the last afternoon that my father lived, though with no premonition, I preferred to be with him, and invented an absence from mother, Vinnie being asleep, and he seemed peculiarly pleased, as I oftener stayed with myself. And he remarked as the afternoon withdrew that he would like it not to end. His pleasure almost embarrassed me, and my brother coming, I suggested they walk. And next morning, I woke him for the train, and saw him no more. Father doesn't live with us now. He lives in a new house. Though it was built in an hour, it is better than this. But he hasn't any garden, because he moved after gardens were made. So, we take him the best flowers. And if we only knew that he knew, perhaps we could stop crying. Though it is many nights, my mind never comes home. At the funeral, Austin leaned over the coffin and kissed Father's forehead and said, "There, Father. "I never dared do that while you were living." [soft sobbing] 'Scuse me. The birds! The birds Father rescued are trifling in his trees. How flippant are the saved. They were even frolicking at the grave when Vinnie went there, yesterday. Nature must be too young to feel, or many years too old. I dream about Father every night, always a different dream, and forget what I'm doing daytimes wondering where he is. Without anybody, I keep thinking, what kind can that be? You know, you know, he never really learned how to play, and the straightest engine has its leaning hour. His heart was pure, and terrible. I think no other like it exists. I'm glad there is immortality, but I would've tested it myself before entrusting him. Home. So far from home, since my father died. My life closed twice before its close. It yet remains to see if immortality unveil a third event to me. So huge, so hopeless to conceive as these that twice befell. Parting is all we know of Heaven, and all we need of Hell. Oh, I'll never forget Father's coming home from his office for noontime dinner. Up Main Street he'd come like a deacon carrying his gold-headed cane and wearing his glossy beaver hat. Vinnie, Vinnie, Father's coming. Quick, hide the mop and the bucket. You fell down the stairs? How did you? Oh, Mother, Mother take the handkerchief off your head. [soft inhalation] What's that smell? Maggie? Maggie, it's the cabbage. I think it's boiling over. Oh, Vinnie, do something about Buffy; she's clawing the sofa. Oh! Oh, Father's coming in the gate. He's almost here. Oh, Mother, did you check the thermometer? I hung it in the east window. Yes, I'll see to the fire. Buffy, out of Father's chair. Scat! Vinnie, where's Father's newspaper? No, it's not by his chair. I haven't even seen it, yet. Oh, damn! Oh, I found it. [audience laughing] It was in your sewing basket. Oh, there he is; he's at the door. Oh, good noon, Father. Did you have a fine morning at the office? Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, yes, it was very quiet here. Very peaceful, restful morning, wasn't it, Mother? Vinnie, is she limping? I didn't notice. Awful smell? I don't smell anything, Father. Oh, the temperature. Mother, Father wants to know the temperature. Oh, it's 14 degrees. [shivery sigh] It's 14 degrees, Father. Your spectacles are on your nose, Father. Oh, the newspaper, yes. Yes, Father, it's right here. Well, it is a little bit wrinkled, but speak to Vinnie, it's Buffy. Oh, Maggie's ready for us, Father. Oh, it's your favorite: corned beef and cats. Uh. Cabbage. You see? Pandemonium. And now, the house is so quiet, with just Vinnie and me. Ever since Father died, I've worried about Vinnie. She says the strangest things. She treats me as if I were a child and she, my nursemaid. We had a terrible fire in Amherst on the 4th of July, at night. You remember. And Vinnie tried to make me believe that it was only the holiday fireworks. She kept saying, "Don't be afraid, Emily. "Don't be afraid. "It's only the 4th of July." but I know a fire when I see one. And what a night that was for Mr. Frink and his noble fire brigade. I mean, for a while it was light as day. There were people running up and down the street, shouting. It seemed like a theater night in London. Mother slept through it all, and Vinnie kept saying, "Don't be afraid. "It's only the 4th of July." Vinnie's only the 4th of July, I shall always remember. I think she'll tell me that when I'm dying to keep me from being afraid. A year after Father died, Mother had a stroke in her room, and she never walked again. I suspect that Mother was afraid of dying. She always avoided talking about it. One night when Austin and I were discussing the extension of consciousness after death, Mother told Vinnie afterwards, she thought was very improper. Mothers dying almost stunned my spirit, She slipped from our fingers like a flake gathered by the wind and is now part of the drift called the infinite. This was the way she died, and when her breath was done, took up her simple wardrobe and started for the sun. Her little figure at the gate the angels must have spied, since I could never find her upon the mortal side. You see, we were never intimate as mother and children while she was our mother, but... Mines in the same ground meet by tunneling. And when she became our child, the affection came. Hold your parents tenderly, for the world will seem a strange and lonely place when they're gone. Oh. I wish I were just a blade of grass and they're all these problems of the dust wouldn't terrify me. Why do we cling to this body, this little frame? Why are we afraid to let go? Or sad when others do? If my own machinery should get slightly out of gear, please, someone stop the wheel. For I know that with belts and bands of gold, I shall whizz triumphant on the new streams! Hope is the thing with feathers that perches in the soul and sings the tune without the words and never stops at all, and sweetest in the gale is heard. And sore must be the storm that could abash the little bird that kept so many warm. I've heard it in the chillest land, and on the strangest sea. Yet, never in extremity it asked a crumb of me. Oh, I heard from Helen. She's in California now, a seaside village called Santa Monica. Helen says the sun shines there all the time and there is bougainvillea everywhere. Oh, and Abby Bliss and her husband have just founded the Syrian Protestant College in Beirut. Oh, and I had a lovely letter from Samuel Bowles and his wife, Mary, and they enclosed these wonderful stereopticon pictures. Look at this. It's the Scottish moors. Isn't this a lovely thing? Vinnie gave it to me last Christmas. They're all the rage. It's the Keystone View Company. Oh, and this one is from the Louvre. It's the Mona Lisa. I don't see what all the excitement's about, do you? [audience laughing] And this one is the Blue Grotto at Capri. Mary said they had to row out from the island to see it. Well, everyone is somewhere, except Emily, and Emily's here, always here. I never saw a moor. I never saw the sea. Yet know I how the heather looks. No. And what a wave, wave must be. I never spoke with God, nor visited in Heaven. Yet certain am I of the spot as if the chart were given. Vinnie says a little boy ran away from Amherst a few days ago and when asked where he was going, he replied, "Vermont or Asia." What a smart little boy. I told Vinnie that I wanted to run away, too. I rise because the sun shines and sleep is over with. And I brush my hair and dress myself, and wonder what I am, and who has made me so. I tie my hat, I crease my shawl. Life's little duties do, precisely, as the very least were infinite to me. I put new blossoms in the glass and throw the old away. I push a petal from my gown that anchored there. I weigh the time 'twill be 'til six o'clock. I have so much to do. And yet, existence, some way back, stopped, struck my ticking through. Therefore, we do life's labor though life's reward be done, with scrupulous exactness to hold our senses on. Oh, but there are the children. Thank God for that. They keep my imagination keen and alive. Austin and Sue gave me a niece and two nephews. Ned and Mark are the oldest, and little Gilbert. Little Gilbert was born when Ned was 14. When Gilbert was small, he was stung by a wasp on his arm, and he begged Sue through his tears to read the Bible to the wasps. And when he was six, he and a little friend had an animal show in a tent on the lawn. And we asked him what he was gonna do with all those pennies he'd gathered for admission. And he said, "Well, we're gonna give half to the college and half to the cat." [audience laughing] And when Sue tried to teach him how to sing There's No Place Like Home, he broke in and said, "Oh, yes, there is, too, over at Aunt Emily's." Over at Aunt Emily's. October is a mighty month, for in it, little Gilbert died at eight years. Typhoid. Not my little Gib. I see him in the star, meet his sweet velocity in everything that flies, the little boy we laid away never fluctuates. His dim society is companion still. His last cry in delirium was, "Open the door, open the door! "They're waiting for me." Quite used to his commandment, his little aunt obeyed. Who were waiting for him? All we possess we would give to know, all this, and more. But is there more? Dear friends, more than love and death? Tell me its name. I reason, earth is short and anguish absolute, and many hurt, but what of that? I reason, we could die. The best vitality cannot excel decay, but what of that? I reason, that in Heaven, somehow, it will be even, some new equation given, but what of that? I've had a curious winter, very swift, sometimes so bright. I haven't felt well much, and March amazes me. Well, I didn't think about it, that's all. And I hayed for the horse two Sundays ago and it's snowed since, but now the full circle of seasons. Spring has come, although delayed. But I would eat evanescence slowly. And the lawn is full of South and the odors tangle. And did you hear today for the first, the river in the tree? Spring is a happiness, so beautiful, so unique, so expected. I don't know what to do with my heart. I dare not leave it. I dare not take it. What do you advise? Eight Saturday noons ago, I was making my black cake with Maggie, dear Maggie. And I saw great darkness coming, and I knew no more until late at night. And I woke and found Austin and Vinnie and a strange physician, a Dr. Bigelow bending over me and supposed that I was dying, or had died. All was so kind and hallowed. But I had fainted, lain unconscious for the first time in my life. Now, what flower did Austin plant on Gilbert's grave? Oh, it was lilies of the valley. I remember, and on Father and Mother's, it was damson hawthorn. Well, when it shall come my turn, I want a buttercup. Surely the grass will give me one. I told Vinnie that I wanted to be carried in a little white coffin, out the back door of Homestead, and into the blue, beloved air, and through my garden and Father's barn, and out over the meadows of Amherst to the burial ground. And for my requiem [brief chortle], that phraseless melody the wind does. And I can hear Vinnie say, "Don't talk like that, Emily." But I say, don't be afraid, dear Vinnie. It's only the 4th of July. [audience laughing] My earliest friend wrote me the week before he died. If I live, I will go to Amherst. If I die, I certainly will. Oh, democratic death. Life is short, isn't it? And when one is done, I wonder, is there not another? And then, if God is willing, perhaps we are neighbors again. I wonder if I've ever dreamed, or if I'm dreaming now. I cannot tell how eternity seems. It sweeps around me like a sea. And this world is such a little place. Just the red in the sky before the sun rises, so let us keep fast hold of hands, please. So when the birds begin, none of us be missing. The name they dropped upon my face with water in the country church, Emily Elizabeth, is finished using now, and they can put it with my dolls, my childhood, and the string of spools I finished threading. Because I could not stop for death, he kindly stopped for me. The carriage held but just ourselves and immortality. We slowly drove, he knew no haste, and I had put aside my labor, and my leisure too, for his civility. We passed the school where children played, their lessons scarcely done. We passed the fields of gazing grain. We passed the setting sun. We paused before a house. It seemed a swelling of the ground. The roof was scarcely visible, the cornice but a mound. Since then 'tis centuries, and yet, feels shorter than the day I first surmised the horses' heads were toward eternity. Oh, it's six o'clock. Well, I promised Vinnie that I would peel the apples. You know, our visit was easier than I thought. We very seldom have guests, anymore. Oh, yes, Vinnie, I'm coming. Oh, but one more thing. This, this is my letter to the world that never wrote to me, the simple news that nature told with tender majesty. Her message is committed to hands I cannot see. For love of her, sweet countrymen, judge tenderly of me. And when you make my cake, please tell me how you like it. And when next we meet, I'll give you my recipe for gingerbread. Oh, gingerbread! Now, there's a word to lift your, yes, Vinnie, I'm here! [audience applauding] - [Audience] Bravo! Bravo! [audience cheering] - That's all I have to give today, this, and my heart, beside, this and my heart and all the fields, and all the meadows, wide. Be sure you count, should I forget, someone the sun could tell. This and my heart and all the bees, which in the clover dwell. We give you our parting love. [audience applauding] - [Audience] Bravo! [low audience murmur]
