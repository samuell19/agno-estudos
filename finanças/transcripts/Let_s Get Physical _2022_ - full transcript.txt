alright, everyone, who's ready to sweat? Five, six... Five, six, seven, eight... okay, ladies, this time is for you. Be in the moment. And love yourself! Alright, nana. You're looking good. I can't wait to see you in a bikini. Oh, my bikini days are over, but with these moves... My sex life is on fire. don't hate the player, hate the game, ladies. April, stay with me, alright? We only have a few more minutes. And pull up. Kick. right on time. and lift. Kick. Sadie smith, you're under arrest. what's going on? officer, is this really necessary? It's okay, nana. I've got this. Well, I am calling the mayor right away. What's going on? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. You did this? I tried to warn you. girl, you know I needed to get away from that desert heat. Talk about drying up and turning into dust. You know, at least here, I can start over, maybe free these people from these kooky lives. I don't know. Anyway, I'm pulling up. Wish me luck. thank you for agreeing to show me the space. is it everything you expected? It's more. The light, the energy. Are you okay if I put up mirrors? Yeah. I don't see why not. You're a yoga teacher? Not really. I teach fitness classes for the mind and body. A little dancing, a little pilates, and a few spicy pole moves sprinkled on top. Pole? As in pole dancing? Don't knock it till you try it. Why luton, new hampshire? Well, it checked all of my small-business boxes. Affluent area. Safe. Absolutely no competition. You're a savvy entrepreneur. We need more of you in this town. You're gonna love it here. Do you want to see the office? - Yes. - Let's go. And it has a separate entrance from the parking area in the back. Are you okay if I install some security cameras back here? Sure. This is a quiet area, though. We don't get much crime. I'm not just a real-estate agent, I'm also a very proud mayor. Does the office share a wall with the place next door? Yeah, just one. It's a small hair salon on the other side. Oh, but if you're playing loud music... Oh, I offer massage and wellness coaching back here. It shouldn't be an issue. Massage? Yeah. You seem a little tense. You should come see me. On the house, of course, mr. Mayor. Really? Call me anytime. I could use the clients. Well, you picked the right guy. I know everyone. That's what I thought. Uh... You good with covering both the spaces? Yes. I have several income streams. I'm also looking for an apartment. Are you interested in a real-estate hat trick? Absolutely. And if I could put my mayor hat on, I run a business mixer every month. It's coming up on the 10th. You should come. I think I'll check it out. Yeah, check you out. You know... check it out. I don't know why I said that. Welcome to luton. I'm glad you liked it. It was a pleasure meeting you. thank you. You're welcome, and I'll look into... Good morning! Morning. Morning, mayor kemp. Carol. April. Do you see her? What? See who? See who? Is it beth's plastic surgery? Beth had plastic surgery? Well, she said it was a breast reduction, but it was definitely a full-body lipo. No doubt. Looks like you're getting a new neighbor. wow. She runs her own business and she looks like she's barely 18. You know what, I really need to start using moisturizer. I will get you that sunscreen. You know, I keep inviting you to my cosmetic parties. You know, I can't afford your bougie skin care. Oh, the mayor! Mayor. A moment? Yeah. - Hi. - Hi! It looks like you've got a new tenant next door. Yes. High street has a new health and wellness studio called dazzle & spin. Sadie runs it and specializes in pole-ates. Pole-what-now? Some exercise dance thing. She is awfully attractive. Is she? - I hadn't noticed. - Right. So is she married? Kids? I'm not sure. carol, this isn't an article for your newspaper. Where is she living? A b&b. She's still looking for a place. Well, you know that my sister-in-law marcia is moving out of the garage apartment this weekend, so, I don't know, maybe sadie will want to take a look. Do you think that's safe for you? You don't even know her. She seems nice. I'll mention the apartment. Thanks. Have a good day, ladies. I do not think pole-ates is the right match for our town. Has mr. Quinn asked you out yet, carol? No. And don't change the subject. Look, I rely on you to be my eyes and ears in this town, so don't fail me now. Okay. You wanna grab lunch after? Yeah, but not that burger place on elm. I yelled at them on Tuesday. - Carol! - What? They undercook the meat. Ben could have died. hi! We just opened. It's a really great fitness... Class. Hey there! Hi. We just opened. It's a great... hi. Hi. Welcome. Dazzle & spin. hi. We just opened. Dazzle & spin. You wanna give it a try? Hi. Hi there. I'm... Oh! You're sadie. And I'm rude. You have a really nice place here, rude. I can't believe I haven't come over to introduce myself. I'm April. Nice meeting you. I was just wondering if you would pass out some flyers for me? Oh! Yeah. Happy to. Um... Yeah. Half the town spins in my chair, so. I noticed. I heard that you might still be looking for a place to live, because my sister-in-law just moved out of our garage apartment. Oh! I would love to see it. Yeah, I'm staying at this bed and breakfast until I find a place, but the innkeeper... She has these, like, dolls... Yeah. She brings them in here. I trim their hair. - Oh... - She brings them in. Right. - That's really creepy. - Yeah. Okay, so I need to get out of there. - Mm-hmm. You do. - Yeah. - Hi. - Hi! Hi! Come on in. I'm sadie. I'm nana. Nice to meet you. - Wow. - Yeah. Welcome. Welcome... To dazzle & spin. How do you drive these things? Oh, boy. I think it's just you and me today. Okay, let's stretch our hips out. nana, you are my only student. Why is it so hard to start a new business in this town? The personalities in luton definitely don't make it easier. These are not wild folk. Not yet anyway. Ooh, I like the spirit. Here, I'm going to help you. Are you going to the small business meeting later? You should. In my experience, personal connections are better than any form of advertising. Are you gonna go? Do I look like the sort of person who would miss an opportunity for free wine? Certainly not. What makes her think that's an appropriate dress to wear to a networking event at a church? People certainly won't forget her. Brian. Who is this lovely creature? Sadie, this is jim rogers... Car dealership owner. Wait. How does a lion greet a new animal in the field? I don't know. Pleased to eat you! Wow. Hello, everyone! Let's get started. We have a new face. Welcome! seriously? What? She could be a client. Could you have been more obvious? I mean, really? Why don't you tell us about your business? Thank you for inviting me. Hi, everyone. I'm sadie and I own the new health and fitness center, dazzle & spin, on high street. She teaches pole dancing. carol! What are you doing here? Do you own a business I'm not aware of? I cover newsworthy events, nana. Sadie's talking. Carol is right. I teach a combination of dance and pole-ates... Which is guaranteed to make you sweat. I'm feeling pretty warm already. I also offer massage and wellness coaching for my clients who want a different kind of sweat. So here are my cards. The first class is free. Hope to see you there. Thank you for that assist. Of course. I love carol, but she can be very carol sometimes. I wanted to let you know that the apartment is ready. Oh, that's great! Sadie, sadie. This is minister preston. Hi. I'm sadie. - Nice to meet you. - You too. In addition to sharing this glorious space with us, he also runs the luton gala. It's the most important community charitable event of the year. It's a small gathering for a good cause. But it's a great networking event. I'm all in. That's great! How can I help? hey, I'm home. you're home early. How did the business mixer go? Let me guess, they burned the sexy new girl at the stake? Not yet. no. Sexy new girl is our new tenant. And they didn't use a stake, they used my stripper pole. Oh, that's good to hear. please forgive my brother. You're going to love the new apartment. Thanks. You guys hungry? Yes, please. - Cocktails? - Yes, please. Yes. Make mine a double. I'm trying to convince your wife to try a lesson. Are you gonna do it? Do you think that I should? Tread carefully, marty. There are a lot of knives in the kitchen. No, I think you're perfect just the way you are. I agree. April is spicy as is. But, you know, these lessons are not about need. It's just about wanting more in life. If you change your mind, I have a lonely pole. You can try it out. That's what marty said to me on our first date. alright, I'll try it one time. spin down. Move with your butt. - You try. - No. No, no, no. Around the pole. You're gonna milk it. Down and arch your back. - Walking around. - Yes. Oh, yes. - Hello. - Yup. remember to hook your ankles. Hook my ankles. Do I take a run at it? And we go up! wait, wait, go slow! yeah, you just grabbed my butt. My face hurts... My face hurts from smiling so much. I do need to get you some more clients, though. I can't be your only client. That would be incredible. Well, people in my chair are a very captive audience, so. Yeah. Oh, my goodness. This was really fun. I needed this. Yeah. I needed this, too. Right. Let's do it again. - One more time? - One more time. Come on! Ow. I can't even stand up. You were so close. My muscles have atrophied. okay. This will work. Right. ben! Pick you up later, I guess. Oh, he's coming over. Don't be weird... Don't be weird. Don't be weird... Ms. Martin, always a pleasure. Oh, mr. Quinn! I thought I told you, you can call me carol. Carol. Gerald. Gerald! Funny, I never knew that was your first name until now. Nor did I. I really enjoyed the gazette this morning. You know, without those recipes in the back, I'd be eating the same thing all week. Oh, that's so sweet of you. A lot of those are from my grandmother's recipe book. Oh. I should head inside. Good luck with those numbers. Right. Oh, my god. one more time. Come on, guys. Hip, hip, hip, hip. And head! Hip. And to the other side. And head. wait a second! Carol! Carol! I'm so sorry. Do we have an appointment? No, but what are you doing in there? It's so fun. You have to try this. Yeah, well, that's never happening. You know, it sure seems business is picking up for her. How did so many women hear about her studio? Did a little birdy tell them? I'm not just your eyes and ears, carol. I am my own person, and I happen to like her, so, yes, I may have mentioned it to a few people. And before, you know, you hear this from anybody else, she's living in the garage apartment. Don't you think that's a bit of a temptation for marty? No, carol, I do not. Why would that be an issue? You don't know her. Honey, I'm worried about you. I'm going to head back there... And you should come with me. It's fun. She's fun! I don't sweat in public, April. you're incredible. incredible? You're pretty incredible yourself. You run a thriving real-estate business, you find time to be mayor, and you advocate for small businesses like mine. Well, your success is my success. I'm going to tell everyone about tonight. That means a lot to me. god, you have the hands of an angel. Well, they can take you to heaven, mr. Mayor. I mean, if you want. Turn over. Well, is there anything else I can do to make you happy, brian? Hot stones? I offer a variety of extra services upon request. What do people normally request? I think you know. Oh... Cute. hi, petey. Oh, hey, April. Hey, sadie. Any chance your mom would consider donating a gift certificate to the luton gala? My mom? Well, I'd have to call her. She's away on a retreat? still? Wow, it smells amazing in here. What is that and how do I get it? Ooh. These are my famous muffins. Wow. These are incredible. How come I've never tried these before? I usually just make them for my mom. these are so good! - You have to sell these. - Really? Or better yet, put them out on a cart, so the smell will waft across high street. You'd be sold out every day. And, listen, I know these things. I'm a muffin specialist. so am I. because I bake muffins. Mm-hmm. See you later, muffin man. - oh, yeah. See ya. - They're good. Bye, April. Bye, sadie. The coconut is on the house. Thank you! so, how's the new place? It's okay. I thought it would be nice to live alone, but mostly, it just gives you a lot more time to think. Hmm. And that's a bad thing? Well... Is there anything you need to talk about? Well, I really hate dating. oh. I mean, it's like I keep checking boxes on things everyone thinks I'm supposed to do, but none of it's making me happy. Well, I think a lot of people can relate to that, and you certainly don't have to have all of the answers... Especially at once, right? What do you say you come over tonight for dinner? Because we sure miss having you. No, no, I'm fine. - Honestly. - Yeah? More importantly, what are you planning for marty's birthday? Oh! No idea. Can I have a 20? Yeah. I don't know how April and everyone has gotten so taken with this woman. Why does it bother you so much? My hair is suffering, ben. You're jealous that your one friend made a new friend? No! I have excellent instincts and I am very... Mom, your instincts are telling you to be crazy judgmental? She's literally a stranger. I have known women like her my whole life. Women who have gotten by on their looks while the rest of us have toiled to be taken seriously. Grandpa told me he gave you the gazette as a graduation present. I've seen succession. You haven't had to toil that much. Get out. dazzle & spin fitness and massage. Yes, I do have an opening for tonight. May I ask who referred you? Perfect. Do you have any special requests? Is this what you had in mind? Yes, I can absolutely accommodate that. you've outdone yourself! I've only just begun. You're gonna have more auction items than you know what to do with. Do you attend religious services? Oh, not really. Movement is my spiritual practice. Well, however you connect to god. Well, I'll drop off the other auction items this week, okay? Maybe I could pick them up from you instead? Any time. how can I make you feel good? ben? Is everything okay in there? I'm fine, mom. I'm good. Everything's good. it's okay. Take your time. Tell me why you're here. I haven't been with a woman in a long time. My wife died eight years ago. I'm so sorry. We don't have to do anything, we can just talk. She was great. She would have been first in line for your classes. She wasn't close-minded. Like a lot of people around here can be. Do you mind if we dance? - She sounds really great. - Mm-hmm. She was. She... She didn't walk into rooms, she floated. I used to bring her fresh flowers every week. Oh... That's really sweet. What woman doesn't love flowers? Yeah, well... Sometimes, it feels... Like a part of me died with her. You're not dead, mr. Quinn. And I think she'd want you to really live. carol? mr. Quinn. Excuse me. I didn't mean to interrupt. These are for you. Oh, how lovely! What is the occasion? Carol martin, will you go on a date with me? Gerald, I would like that very much. Great. I'll pick you up Saturday. I have good news! Gerald asked me. Finally! Yes! When is the big date? Saturday. A whole week to imagine all the horrible ways it will go wrong. Oh, carol, don't think that way. I'm sure it will go wrong in entirely unexpected ways. Thank you for the confidence. I've missed you. I've missed you, too. You know, I was thinking, maybe I was too quick to judge sadie. Is this a trap? No. There's nothing wrong with a woman taking control of her sexuality... Even if she does flaunt it a bit too much... But it's not like she's doing anything illegal. Exactly! I should get to know sadie better. You have great taste in friends. Maybe I'll like her. I'm really happy with the planning committee's work and I want to thank you all for jumping in and helping to make this one of the best gala events ever. And if there's no further business, we can just... I have something. If we have time. Sadie. Sure, come on up. Okay. Thanks. Thank you. What if we thought bigger? - Bigger? - Bigger. Yes. Every year, we donate the silent-auction sales to the same community children's fund. But what if we could raise more money and donate to more charities? I don't know. Small is the way we've done it since the beginning. and it works beautifully, but let's build upon it. Like, for instance, we could do a 50/50 raffle. Carol? Sadie is right. Bigger is better. Count me in for some free ad space in the gazette. wow! Thank you again. This has been perfect. Well... Truly... Can I just say... How great it is that you've moved here? Not just for the friendship, but also because you like the same quality of tv that I do. Guilty. And you've turned this town into a straight-up beyonce song. What is that about? Sexual liberation will do that. - Seriously? - Yes. Where did you come from? My clients in the salon... They can't stop talking about their sex life. That's the plan! The revolution, you know, it starts one small town at a time. That's the plan? To move from town to town like some sort of, like, sexed-up, pole-dancing mary poppins? I don't like that title. - Sexed-up? - Mary poppins. what's with the camera? Oh, I just record some dance moves. Oh. sorry to interrupt ladies' night. I need you back home. Oh, yes, go. - Do you mind if I go? - Yes, please. Okay. - Bye. - Bye. Have fun, guys. see you later. oh, my god. - hey. - Hi. Everything okay over there? Yeah, why? Were you in the office? I heard some weird noises. Oh, yeah, I was giving a massage, but it was just a loud client. Oh! Okay. Gotcha. Gotcha. I was just... You know, I was worried about you for a second. Oh, you never need be worried about me. Remember, I have those security cameras, too. Right. I forgot. Maybe I should get some? Oh, no, that's not necessary. It covers both the doors. I'll let you know if I ever see anything suspicious. Oh, that's so nice of you. Um, do you wanna hang out later tonight? It's marty's birthday coming up and I don't know what to get him. I know exactly what to get him. I didn't expect to be so emotional. I've never done this before. Well, that's a shame. You're good at it. But it's wrong. I'm failing my parish. I'm failing god. It's not wrong to crave human connection, it's normal. People look to me for guidance. And I'm human, too. We all succumb to temptation. Well, maybe this will give you a better understanding of your parish. And you're familiar with my parishioners? I know them fairly well. It doesn't change anything. hey, sadie. You're here early again. that was awesome. See you next week. jim? You're sleeping with jim? He's married! We know his wife. I like his wife. How could you do this? I wasn't expecting you so early. Do you want to maybe get some breakfast? What is this? What? What kind of massages are you doing here? All kinds. Um... Okay, were you giving jim, like, a massage, you know, before, like, it got... - Sexual? - Yeah. Did jim come on to you? We're two consenting adults, April. Maybe we should get some pancakes for breakfast. Pancakes? Pancakes? yeah, I'm a little hungry. I mean, I like pancakes. Pancakes are normal. You know what you're getting. Like a massage. Right? But then you add... - Sausage. - Yeah. - On the side. - Right. And then they pay you for it. The whole breakfast. And all the sides? Yeah. You're a prostitute? I help people connect to themselves and their partners in new ways. It's a business, but it's also a service. - Like a therapist? - Yes. Like a sex therapist. Like a licensed sex therapist? No. I wanted to tell you, I just didn't want to put you in a bad spot. Yeah... It's a little late. Are you mad because I'm doing it or are you mad because I didn't tell you? Um, both! Well, my business is separate from our friendship, and it's really not that big of a deal unless you make it so. I mean, sex work is work. You're a prostitute? I consider myself a creative entrepreneur, but if we're assigning labels, then, yes, I'm a prostitute. Okay. A prostitute. - Honey? - Hmm? - Is everything okay? - No. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. That was a rollercoaster. I need some advice. - From me? - Mm-hmm. I'm just not usually your go-to for advice. This is new. And scary. So, if you had a friend who was doing something illegal, would you turn them in? I guess it depends. Are they hurting people? Kind of? I mean, it would hurt if they found out. Then I'd probably let it slide. Really? That's your advice? You see? That's why I said I was scared. No, I'm being serious. Honey... You're a good person. If your heart tells you something is wrong and you ignore it, it's just going to keep getting louder and louder, and then you'll know what you have to do. But until then, maybe just accept that people do things that we don't approve of, but we love them anyway. Okay? So, like, how many people have you done it with? I think five has been the most. Oh, okay. So you only have, like, five customers? Oh, no, we were counting different things. Oh! So you've done it with five people at once? You can say sex. That's not a bad word. And until we let go of this puritanical way of thinking, society is never going to evolve. I mean, we can get onboard with only fans, but this is a problem? Well, this is illegal. It shouldn't be. Okay, so who's your typical customer? Middle-aged, old, white dudes. Have you seen this town? Do you ever get attached to these dudes? I mean, sex is sort of intimate, right? It's not that intimate for me. I just close that part of myself off. So... I mean, what happens if you start to like somebody? Do you have romantic relationships? Boyfriends? Girlfriends? I've tried. It doesn't really work out so well. People get jealous, so. Hmm. Well, it must be very hard to open yourself up you know, after you've been so closed off for so long. Relationships are overrated. Are friendships overrated? You know, you can't keep lying and expect people to trust you. I mean, that's not really how friendships work. Well, I wouldn't know. I've been alone most of my life. Well, not anymore. There's no more secrets. Fine. I promise. what do you want to see? Who do you want me to be? Ben? Is everything okay? Mr. Quinn said you skipped out on mathletes. I'm fine, mom. Just tired. Are you sick? No. Honey, what are you doing in there? Don't come in! I'm just doing my homework! Leave me alone! I'm just going to have a shower. I'll do anything you want. There you go. Thanks, daphne. I haven't seen you in a while. You must be busy. I have to show you both something. Gird your loins. Check this out. I'll do anything you want. She is selling videos of herself, doing things to herself. Wow. Okay. Well, let's just take... Take a deep breath here and try and figure out why she might do something like this. I am not calming down, April! My son saw her cookie! I understand why you're upset. I am upset about ben, but I am also upset on April's behalf. Here. Look. Look at the windows in the background. it's my apartment. Mm-hmm. She is filming porn at your house. Look, I don't love that she is filming at my apartment, but, I mean, is it illegal? It's not. Okay, well, times are tough, maybe this is none of our business what she does to make money. None of our business that she is filming secret sex tapes in your rental? I mean, clearly, I'm gonna have to get a cleaning lady. how are you making jokes? This isn't funny. I'm worried about you and marty? These are tapes of her alone... What if she is filming with other people? What if she's bringing strangers on to your property? I've looked into her background. She's never been arrested or anything. But she is a former stripper. I can look into her background, too. Stripping is not illegal. I mean, if ben saw this, it will only be a matter of time before the rest of the town does, right? Let's just explain to her that this is not okay... For her reputation and for us. Oh, sure, April. Why don't we just take her out to brunch, too? Over mimosas, I can just ask her to stop exposing her vagina to my underaged son. Oh, my god, carol. You know, I... I don't want ben thinking that porn is what's normal and sexy. I was never afraid to have sex talks with him, but this... this is different. This is intense role-playing... And it's someone he knows... And it's just... it's not right. It's not right, but what sadie did is not illegal. Give me a break. Maybe I will write about her in the paper. I will talk to her and ask her to stop filming. Yeah. Fine. Watch your back. Who knows what she might do with your husband. She clearly lacks boundaries. squeeze those buns, ladies. Up, and keep going! Up! We need to talk. Um, I'll be right back, ladies. What is it? Videos? You told me there were no more secrets! I wasn't hiding the videos, so I didn't think that was a secret. You said you didn't want to hurt anyone, right? Well, carol's teenage son has been buying your tapes. I bet that didn't go over well. No. And then she got daphne involved. I mean, you don't want to get caught here, do you? Just take them down. I can't do that. That would be allowing someone to shame me into hiding who I am. Well, then do it for me. Look, I am... I'm trying real hard here to accept all of this, so meet me halfway. Okay. If it means that much to you, I'll take them down. But I've got to get back to class. Jim? Poor lynn. Lynn! Oh, god! Where'd you come from? Have time for a quickie? No. I'm totally booked solid. Sorry. Please? For an old friend? A fellow cheer captain? Wow, you're really pulling out all the stops, huh? I'll tell you what, lynn, why don't you come back tomorrow? You can literally have any appointment you want. How about just a little zhuzh? I'm going to the dealership. I'm going to talk to jim about the matching grant for the gala. I'm wearing my power suit and I need hair to match. Okay. A real quick one. So that sadie's a real kick in the pants, huh? Oh, yeah. I love how she's challenging us all to think outside the box. Hmm. Me too. what is that? Um, sadie teaches classes in her office. Right now, so they're probably doing jumping jacks, and squats, and planks, and whatnot. Too funny. I thought it sounded like sex. Oh... Shows where my head's at. This is probably tmi, but jim has just been voracious in bed lately. He wants it four or five times a week now. We weren't doing it four or five times a year before. I don't know what changed, but I wish I could bottle it! Lucky you! play sex dong... song! Sex. Play song. Dong! Oh, my god. My friend, mary, says sadie's classes have made her multi-orgasmic. Has that ever happened to you? oh! Stop music. - Oh, my god. - Sorry! I'm thinking I should start taking classes. Maybe sadie can teach this old dog some new tricks. Is it hot in here? It's hot in here. You know what, you're set. You look good. Can I use your ladies' room? Um, you know what, no. No. It's all backed up. Wow. Who's done your highlights? You. She did a good job. Wait. Is that jim? no. No, no, no. He's at work, I'm sure. No, it is jim. I wonder what he's doing here. I mean, no offense, this isn't exactly a happening area. Your salon, petey's... Nana's. There's the flower shop. Nana's. You're right. It's our anniversary coming up. Aw! I don't wanna spoil the surprise. Thank you for the hair. - What do I owe you? - It's on me. Truly, your hair has never looked better. Go, bulldogs. - Sisters for life. - Go, bulldogs. Yup! jim? Holy shit. that was funny. what are you doing here? It's family dinner night. Marcia couldn't make it, and you were working late, so sadie cooked. Oh, how nice. She made this really good spicy chicken dish. She's a really good cook. Oh, thank you! I saved you some. You want some? I'm good. I'll get another bottle. - Good idea. - Yeah. is everything okay? Hey. It's me. Yeah, so, um, I think you're right. Although I was too scared to admit it, I think there is something off about her. You know? My gut says... That her massage clients are paying her for sex. Mm-hmm. I don't know how much she charges, carol. Why would I know that? Okay? Well, how much do you... Oh. She made spicy chicken. I knew it. I was right. An illegal prostitution ring right under our noses. It isn't exactly a ring, carol. Has sadie confessed what she's doing? Uh, no. Have you seen money exchange hands? I mean, I've heard them talking. And, you know, I may have heard sex noises. Okay. Let's not jump to conclusions, okay? I mean... Infidelity is not a crime... And April is hearing all of this through a wall. We need more than that to get a warrant. Well, April could put in a hidden camera... - No, no. - That's not happening. - Mm-mm. - Mm-mm. Look, I'm not on the clock... But we can start by building a paper trail. Okay? To track them coming and going. - Wait. Is that wine? - Mm-hmm. Seriously, we can't drink wine in this park. Well, what are you gonna do? Call the police? It's yummy. look, I don't want to get involved in this case. I have told you what little I know, and that is the extent of it. well, fine. Then I will kick things off by making a formal complaint about my underaged son purchasing her porn videos. The way I should have from the beginning. Isn't there a way of getting her to stop without having her arrested? I just... I think that she is a good person. I know it. She genuinely feels like she's helping these men. But the law doesn't distinguish between good law breakers and bad. You did the right thing coming forward. you did. I did. all right, ladies. Take your left leg, hook your knee, whip over, whip your head back up. That's it! All right, try it again, try it again. Nana! Nice job with that head whip. That was sexy. No one can change your life but you. Let's see, lynn. Oh, yes! I love that head whip! That was beautiful. I used to be a cheerleader with April in high school. Well, that makes sense why you two can move your bodies so well. Let's give your husbands something to talk about tonight. Hallelujah! Seriously? Stop. Is everything okay? this is too much. Let's regroup, everybody. Come on, from the top. You want some more wine? - Honey? - Hmm? Sorry, what? You're quiet today. Yeah, I'm... I'm just thinking. Are you worried about, sadie? Sadie? Why would I be worried about sadie? Because of her videos. You know about those? Yeah, guys like to gossip, too, you know? Have you seen them? No, as a general rule, I don't like to look at any of your friends' vaginas. Oh. Good to know. Is that the criminal activity that you were worried about? Because porn isn't illegal. I mean, sadie's cute, but she's not exactly a criminal mastermind. You think she's cute? Not as cute as you. Come here. Hey, girl, what are you... Shh! Just come in and close the door. Sadie told me she's taking money for sex. - So you lied... - She directly confided in me. And, yes, I did lie. Yes, I did. Sorry. And why the sudden change of heart? Jim rogers has been hanging around the office a lot, and let's just say... He's not quiet. - Oh, god. - Mm-hmm. And you saw him pay for sex? Would you touch jim for free? Hell no. There you go. I saw stacks of cash. I mean, it just needs to be stopped, right? She needs to be stopped. And you're willing to make an official statement? I mean, what's official? Yeah. No. I don't know. So, when is the raid happening? Alright, you didn't hear this from me, okay, tomorrow morning. - no? - Yeah. No, I... I thought I was going to be doing recipes and obituaries for the rest of my life, and then this prostitute comes to town. And she hasn't exactly been covert about her activities. No. April said there's a boatload of evidence in her back room. - Really? - Yeah. Wow. I feel so lucky. Thank you, sadie. Jim! why are you staring at me? I thought you were asleep. I was. Marty, are we okay? Like, you would tell me if we weren't, right? Okay... Now I'm up. What is this about? Nothing. Nothing. I just can't sleep. Okay, you'll pay for that. what's up with you? Oh, it just feels good to be right sometimes. Okay. okay! Let's go! yeah, me too. Thank you so much. Gerald! Hi! I am so sorry I keep rescheduling our date. I just wanted to make sure you hadn't forgotten me. Are you kidding? That could never happen. I have been so swamped with this story, but it's finally wrapping up. Anyways, how's Friday? Great. What did you have in mind? I found this salvage guy who fixed up an old printing press from the 1850s. I thought you might get a real kick out of it. We could pack a picnic and spend the day? Oh, that sounds incredible. I hope so. Oh, I'm sorry. I've got to go. I never asked. What's the story about? Oh, I can't say, but it's super juicy. Make sure you buy the paper tomorrow. Okay. oh! I didn't see you there. Wow, that was incredible. Why do all of that when you can do this? Girls like me are a dime a dozen in vegas. You have to pivot to survive. Sadie... People in this town... they talk. you're kidding? They talk a lot. I just... I think you need to leave town. - Just trust me. - What? What are you talking about? Class is starting. Come on. Okay, are we ready, ladies? - hello. - good morning. Doing your own deliveries today? Oh, I was just in the neighborhood. Ooh! It's warm. This cart was such a good idea! Oh, I can't take any of the credit. That was sadie's idea. Of course, it was. Looking spicy, ladies! Really isolate those muscles, move those hips, stir that sugar! Alright, let's go! Nana, looking good! I can't wait to see you in a bikini. Oh, honey, my bikini days are over, but with these moves, my sex life is on fire. mm. There we go. - Oh, petey, sweetie? - Yes? Could I trouble you for a little coconut milk? Of course. Thank you. April, stay with me, alright? Just a few more minutes. Lift, and kick! Remember, this is for you, ladies, no one else. Kick. Right on time. and lift, kick! Sadie smith, you're under arrest. officer! Is this really necessary? It's okay, nana. I've got this. Well, I am calling the mayor right away. What's going on? Sorry. I'm... I'm... I'm so sorry. You did this? I tried to warn you. What? I thought we were friends. thank you, officers. Alright, let's get photos going and evidence bags and boxes up here. my favorite criminals collect their own evidence. We're gathering a database of all her clients. Good news is, she was quite the record-keeper. Look at this. Over 95 clients. We've got her clean on prostitution charges. And once we confirm, the johns will need to be charged with engaging. Chief, a lot of them are married or prominent citizens. Those names are gonna ruffle a lot of feathers in town. The law's the law, right, officer? Yes, sir. Hello, officer spicy. Care to comment on my article? It turns out sadie kept a very detailed list of her clients. Is this christmas? I don't think you understand. They're going to charge the clients, too. So get me the list. You know, just because you have the names doesn't mean you need to print them. Well, that sounds like a cover-up. Not at all. I'm just thinking about the lives of our friends, our colleagues. It's a small town. They made their beds, then they got in their beds and had sex with a prostitute. It's a $200 fine and then it's over. But if you print those names, you can ruin their lives. If I don't print those names, someone else will. Keep telling yourself that, carol. nana... You paid my bail? Everyone's going to hate you. Oh, sugar. Here. Thank you. I mean, I have lived in places where they did not wear a prada chastity belt to go to the grocery store. I mean, everything you did, you didn't do it alone. It was their husbands and their fathers and their sons... And the butchers, the baker, the candlestick maker. And the tax guys. That's true. Been there, screwed that. they need to take a long, hard look at themselves before they judge you. That's true. I need to talk to April, though. I have nowhere to go. Oh, you'll stay with me. Nana. What did I do to deserve you? - Come on, come on. - Thank you. you're welcome, dear. allow me. Best table in the house. Wow. What's the occasion? I think you need to take your mind off everything. Do you think everyone here knows? Definitely. okay. Are you okay? Mm-hmm. You know what, I need to go to the ladies' room. Can you order for me? Sure. I heard an entire law firm in boston passed around her number. Talk about team building. who knew our fitness instructor was working so hard? right? Shame, though, they were good workouts. Your husband didn't... You know? Jim? No way. He's always busy at work. Besides, I would kill him... Slowly... With a frying pan. Hey, April! Can you believe it? That really was sex we were hearing! Crazy. Did you ever suspect? No. Not to that extent. I know you guys were friendly, so if you ever want to talk, please give me a call. Thank you. Bye. Good morning, I'm tricia murata with lqrp morning news. I'm here with carol martin of the luton gazette. Thank you. Thank you, tricia. Last night, the luton police department released the first batch of 21 names from the client list of sadie simpson... The pole-dancing prostitute. It's worth reminding everyone that these are pending charges. All mentioned names have the presumption of innocence. I expect people will be hurt by this publication... And to avoid confusion or false identifications... Because the people of luton look after each other. How does it feel to be making the names of alleged johns public, though? Well, if you've done the crime, you do the time. so you're not talking to me anymore? You realize that everyone hates me now, right? Or do you just not care? Of course, I care. My friends won't even talk to me. Some of their dads were on that list. I am sorry they are taking their fathers' mistakes out on you. If you know it was just a mistake, then why did you have to ruin their lives like this? I am not responsible for the choice... Ben! Ben! - Ben! - Carol... I can't talk right now. You have to let me explain. No need. I understand how sex with a stranger works. Okay. Wow. Well, if it makes you feel any better, you'll be happy to know that they've asked me to resign. It was not my intent for you to lose your job. What exactly was your intent? Don't make me the bad guy. There is no excuse for what you did... And with her, of all people? It's so easy to judge someone else, isn't it? I was lonely. And, yes, maybe I paid sadie for a little human contact, but that does not make me a bad person, carol. Don't you think I get lonely? I'm not made of stone. Coulda fooled me. I wasn't expecting you. There's been a lot of tears in this salon today. Um, could you just excuse us for a second? What's going on? The next set of names are about to be released. Marty's name is on the list. We're going to have to charge him. I'm so sorry. How could you do this? April, it's not what you think. So things were only better between us because you were having sex with sadie here. April, no, you don't understand. In our bed. Here. That's why you weren't on the security tapes, isn't it? Do you really think that I would do that? You let me... You let me run around like a fool, knowing that you were on that list. Did you want to get caught, marty? I don't understand. - Listen... - I don't understand. - Listen, listen. - No. All I need you to know is that I love you. Oh, bullshit. Bullshit. Get out of the house. - April. - Go. Please. You know what, that's fine, I'll leave. April, please listen to me. I can explain. if sadie's ledgers are correct, she made upwards of $100,000 cash. But her tax returns only claimed $18,232.00. This is bad. This is mandatory jail time. The release of the names has really turned luton upside-down. People in my line of work are threatened and blackmailed all the time. Having those records is an important insurance policy. An unfortunate one for the rest of us. It's part of the business. The truth is my clients upended their own lives. They are responsible for the consequences as much as I am. So they simply fell to temptation? I didn't force anyone. You misunderstand me. I'm... Jesus didn't judge mary magdalene. I'm not blaming you. I think I'd feel better if you did. People may regret that their loved ones found out about their indiscretions. But I don't believe they regret the time they spent with you. I know I don't. I pray that I will be able to continue on with this community. But I await my judgement with an open heart. When my name comes up in print, rest assured, I will blame no one but myself. I didn't put your name on the records. Hey. - Can I get a coffee? - Sure. Do you think I'm a kid? Sorry? You knew what sadie was doing and you didn't tell me. Uh... So? So, I would have liked to have been her client or something. Okay... So you're angry because you didn't get a chance to sleep with her? Obviously. Yes. Thank you. Has this whole town gone crazy? April? April, it's tricia from lqrp. I just want to talk to you. April! Wait. well, I'm embarrassed to say that prior to this, I considered her a friend, but what she has done to this community is both amoral and indefensible. Sadie smith is a parasite. And she came to this town and used us all for her financial and sexual gratification. How are you holding up? I'm, like, two seconds away from a nervous breakdown. Sounds about right. These are serious charges. I have a recommendation. You're not going to like it. The d.A. Has offered a plea deal, and I think you should take it. Are you kidding? No one got hurt. Everyone was a consenting adult. The prostitution aside, the state's going to want their pound of flesh for the tax evasion... No matter how strong our defense. So I go to jail and then everyone else goes back to their safe, little lives like nothing ever happened, right? Basically. how could you do this to me? The cops ransacked your apartment, I packed up whatever was left and put it on the curb. And then I ran over it with my car. You were my best friend. You're questioning my friendship after you slept with my husband? What? You think that I would do that to you? Or to marty? I think that you are broken inside! Alright? I think you cannot have a real relationship, or kids, or connections with people. Because I tried... And look what it's gotten me. The only thing you tried was to steal my husband. Why? Because you were jealous of my relationship with marty? No. No, no, no. You knew exactly who I was and you loved it. It felt dangerous and it felt fun to be my friend. You were never a victim, April. None of this made it okay! You used us... And I defended you, I defended you... You turned me in! It was bullshit! You're just like everyone else in this fake town with your fake smiles and your fake friendships. Accusing us of being fake... That's rich. You used us. You collected us one by one to support and protect your business... I don't know... If you can call it that! You were my friend, April. Not anymore. You're just a whore who breezed into town and destroyed everyone's lives. I hope you rot in jail. Okay. Let's just deal with the elephant in the room here. Sadie rolled into town, she dazzled and spinned us into submission, and then she slept with our men. Well, now she's off to prison. She got what she deserved. How could she look me in the eye after sleeping with my husband? And she charged you for classes. That's messed up. I just feel so stupid. You know? I mean, I... I promoted her business, thinking that she cared about us, cared about our town. good riddance. I think it's best if we all just get on with our lives. Let our town get back to normal. There is no normal after this. Oh, you are all crybabies! Your partners and husbands sought sexual gratification with someone totally out of their league. Most men would. And from what I heard, you got the benefit of the lessons. Even if it came with a heap of trouble. Damn whiners. I'm gonna miss that class. Should we even go through with this gala? knock-knock. I'm really not in the mood. This isn't how I expected things to turn out, sadie. How did you expect things to turn out when you were referring all of your friends to me? You all had an itch, you were happy to scratch it. You're right. And I have to step down from office. Do you see what's happening here, brian? My name and face is all over the news. I am trending online. I will forever be known as the "pole-dancing slut from luton". You get a misdemeanor and a $100 fine. I am facing felony charges and the possibility of prison. That's kind of a double standard, don't you think? I think we all need to take a long look in the mirror. oh. - Marty didn't do anything wrong. - Just stop, marcia, please. April, listen. M. Macintosh was the name on that list. Me. Marcia macintosh. I slept with sadie. Wait a minute. What? You mean you're... Gay. Yeah. Evidently, I had to hire a prostitute to be sure. Worst coming-out story ever. Did sadie pressure you? No. The opposite. It was unlike anything I'd ever experienced. I felt more me than I ever had. And I'm glad I did it. I'm glad I could. Wow. Marcia, that's wonderful. Marty knows and he's known for a while. He was just giving me the space to tell you myself, and I failed him. I got nervous. There was all that press. Everyone in town pointing fingers. Then the police were charging people. I mean... I messed up. No, listen. I jumped to conclusions. I was in full rage mode. I said horrible things to marty and to sadie. I mean... This is a mess. I love you. Thank you for telling me. I love you. I missed you and I'm happy for you. Thank you. Marcia came into the salon. It was killing me not being able to tell you. Yeah. Well, it was killing me thinking you cheated. It's weird how quickly you assumed I paid to sleep with a prostitute. You know we don't have that kind of cash. I don't know. We've been so close recently. I guess I just lost my mind thinking that it was another lie. I'm sorry. See, you thought that our sex life was better because sadie was teaching me new tricks. But it was you. Your confidence. The new way that you were embracing your sexuality. Can we talk about that birthday dance? That's what was turning me on. She wasn't inspiring me, it was you. I love you. Have you decided what you're going to do? Honestly, I thought I could make a fresh start here in luton. But I've hurt people. Friends. I've ruined lives. I want to take the plea. It's time we all move on with our lives. what a mess. My re-election bid is over. I don't think we can ever show our face again in this town, I mean... You're telling me. Lynn's throwing me out and I'm staying at the inn. Maybe she just needs some time to process all of this. We all do. No offense, rev, but I don't think time is what she needs. Let's just get these tables put away and then run away and hide till the end of time, okay? April. I don't think we should cancel the gala. really? You don't think we've suffered enough in public? Boo-hoo, brian. Your names end up in the gazette, and you guys think you're the only ones dealing with the consequences? Sadie's in prison. You guys were all too happy to pass along her name to your little buddies when you didn't think you'd be punished, right? I mean, not you, petey. Not you. And not one of you showed an ounce of discretion. Especially not you, jim. Especially not you. Look, sadie changed this town. For the better. Yes, she made some mistakes... Big mistakes... But didn't we all? She brought an energy to luton that, honestly, I don't think we even knew we were missing. And then we brought it back into our homes, our jobs, our beds... Again, not you, petey. What are you doing with this? It was magical. And I don't want to go back to the way we used to be. Don't cancel the gala. I mean... This gala is a million times better than previous years. Thank you so much for participating in the 50/50, nana. Oh, sadie would be so proud. You're right. Cheers. Good luck. Oh... carol. Nana. Oh, I have an idea for a great headline for the newspaper. We already have one for tomorrow. Oh? "pole dancing prostitute spins into jail!" why don't you consider "brave townspeople survive thrashing by local media." I did what any good newspaper reporter would have done. I uncovered the truth. I knew your grandfather. He would be so disappointed in you that you couldn't tell the difference between news and gossip. I did what was right for this town. To save the legacy. She was changing everything. And tempting all the men. Yes. Oh, and... I know all about you and mr. Quinn. That is what makes this so much sadder. Oh, my goodness. They always gotta shoot the messenger, don't they? Come on, nancy drew, let's go hit the photo booth. Okay, but no props. Thanks, man. Cheers. lynn. How dare you show your face here? Lynn, I am so sorry. I really mucked up everything. "mucked up everything"? Jim, you utterly betrayed me and then carol went and published it for the whole town to see. And what I hate most is I still love you. If we can find a way through this, we could probably find our way through anything, but... I'm really not ready. Seriously, when's the last time we didn't try and sneak out on this place as soon as possible? It looks like a sexy mary poppins really did come through luton. Mary poppins? I mean, look, things are different. Some things are the same. I mean, carol's still carol. Yes, she is. I mean, I'm not thrilled that it took a pole-dancing class prostitute to spin things around, but... I'm not saying it was all bad. keep practicing those samba moves, okay? I thought you might need a ride. Sadie, I'm so sorry. I said awful things. And I turned you in. You did think I slept with your husband. And you never betrayed marcia's secret. It's amazing. Why? Secrets are sort of my thing. You mean more than this drama... To me and to a lot of people. You changed our lives. Some more than others, and... Listen, I was in a lot of pain. I was lonely. I just didn't realize how much until I met you. And for the record, I would never sleep with marty. Oh, I know... And he couldn't afford you anyways. So, what are your plans? Are you going to stay in luton? I don't think it's a good idea. Yeah, probably not. I'm really going to miss you. Me too. I do have to get a few things. Would you maybe give me a ride? Oh, absolutely. Yeah. Just have to make a quick stop. Oh, yeah. Okay. you look good. Prison was good for you. Gotta make it work, you know? yeah. It's good enough. - Ready? - What's happening? Why'd you bring me here? we heard you were leaving town, but we really wanted to get in just one more class. Who's ready to sweat one last time?
