Kuam Bosses, pour the drink. Let's have a toast. - Cheers! - Cheers! Also listen to Boss Park unwell today, So, I prepared a small gift. Bring it here. Heesu, I'm struggling get that. I assign the digger famous wild ginseng, and only one is hard to find. There are many elders here. How dare I accept this luxury? Young people need energy to work. It's a waste if it's consumed by the elders. It makes us more difficult to die later. I also prepared a gift for Heesu. Can I give it now? I have never thought you are so generous. You think I'm not human? accept, this little gift. What's that? Is that really your gift? The world is so cruel. To protect something, you need something like that. Heesu, what do you want to protect? Back then, there was something that I protect, but while living in the trenches, I forgot what it was. Isn't that right, damn it? Mr. Ok! Be aware. Do it right! How many times did I warn you? What is it? Stop it! - Good grief. - Heesu, help me... friend, I ask you to control it not beat him! Did I kill him? If you act again, you think your uncle who will call? Clean him and take him to the office. Troublesome. I won't ask you to forgive me. Lost doll boss business because of gambling... unfit to live. If I stay alive, I'll just come back gamble and cheat... Look at my fingers. I cut off one finger to stop gambling. The loan shark cut off two of my fingers. Continue? I'll stab Yongkang and die with him. But in exchange, Can you... send IDR 6.25 million to my son every month? So that he can live... without me. Spring 1993 / Busan Catch another whale? No, now, whale catching is a big problem. The whale got into our net. Later we will drink at the Dongsik shop. - Stop by to eat whale. - We drink! Don't like the smell. You guys. - See you later. - Yes. - Stop by later! - Not! Heesu! Wait! What is it? Why the fuss? Electricity company cut off our electricity! Do something! Why with them? Wait. I'll check. Please do it quickly. Low sales... due to stomach upset. Okay. See you later! Morning, sir! What is it? Yongkang's men came... and ransacked this place. Why are they? The laundry doesn't work right, so, Mr. Kim told them. Should we call the police? Why call the police? Just clean up this place. Yes sir! What are you crazy? Why can't you be contacted? We are at war! Do not exaggerate. No war. If messing with the iron pipe not war, So what? It's hard to get a job. It's not much. I will talk same Yongkang. Will gather the people, so, take them with you! Why bring troops just a trifle? Embarrassing... In that case, Heesu, don't worry about this and just give him some, for him to calm down. If he wants a place on the beach, give him some, okay? - I'll handle it. - That's fine. Just don't in my beach area... It hurt my pride. Embarrassing... Uncle always listen to Heesu. Just leave it our people... finish them off... So, you want to go to war against Yongkang? Dare to face it? Useless shit... You guys come out. Go out. You too! Come on, sir. What the hell... My friend, Heesu. Long time no see. You never came when I invite you. Did you come alone? Sure, should take my parents? I was so scared. I am very scared... You brought Kuam's men. For what? am i amplifying the problem? I got this place... through a fair deal with OK, so, why did you interfere? This place is not his. You know that. You got it just because of the debt. No matter how I have it. If this business is in my name, then this is fair. I just need a signature in the deed of sale. Do not hope. Why? You killed OK? Dude... Past, you are so burly. Now you are old. Do I look petty? Yes, a little. You're not the type to throw a tantrum just because of the laundry problem. Know why did the man get beat up? Where do I know? He ransacked the laundry? He thought it was detergent, and put it in the washing machine. I lost at least IDR 1.25 billion. What do you mean? But he just taught a lesson. Why? The price of methamphetamine is cheap. meth? We distribute, deliver, and transact too. If the police chase us, we will all be imprisoned. Boss and you will not can be a problem. Just sit down and eat cake from us. After you from abroad, you think Kuam is easy? It's been 15 years... since I fled abroad for killing, and nothing has changed since that. The old man is still acting like a hero, and his men have not been trained. I thought you were different. But you're the same with them. Up to you. about the dealer, even thugs like us avoid them. You know why? Drugs are poison tempting. Even if you earn a lot of money and fled abroad, Interpol will come after you until doomsday. You know what Interpol is like. I do not know... Don't know what? Interpol, I never meet them. Have you met them? Stupid, I'm serious. The main thing is, avoid drugs! You use it once partying, then everyone died after that! You want to get involved in that business? Of course. When will I be rich... by selling fake chili? Boss. Moneylender Hong wants to meet with you. Boss, take this. - What's this? - Just a small thing. Aren't you the master of Kuam? But you don't have money yet. - Don't give it away, you idiot. - Just accept it. How can a person who is in debt so dignified? Should I cry? Your debt is IDR 625 million, you hear? At least pay the interest before gambling, got it? I will pay it off when I get a job. Stop nagging me, okay? nagging you? Watch your mouth. Heesu, never leave Boss Son. Once you're out, all your organs are mine. Nonsense. Heesu, you came! Why is it so hard met you recently? - I am busy. - Is that true? With all the liquor this piled up, summer business will be smooth. Soju and beer can't make money. But vodka can make money. Simple taste, cheap price. You should join. I know you're close with the Russian people. I know a rich man by distributing slot machines and karaoke machines. He told me that the era of gambling hotels in Korea It is over. So, what era is it now? Adult arcade. Video game? No, it sounds like it, but the payment with gift cards, not money. It's good business. I want to dominate the market with this. Heesu, want to cooperate? But hotel people will not be silent when they start to lose guests. Friends, how long you will work for your boss? If you last long, you think you will own a hotel? Flounder is his nephew. I don't care about that. By the way, many people in Kuam don't like it with the boss. Because he was successful, he doesn't have to work hard but still receive a monthly fee. That should be enough, but look how greedy he is? You know I like you, right? Yes. So, I'll pretend didn't hear that. How was the sale? Chuljin! Long time no see. Are you busy? You have eaten? You're drunk. You're too great to continue as hotel manager. If you cooperate with Yangdong, you will have great success. Who knows! If I start this arcade business, the hyenas will too want a share. I am sick of with complicated bullshit. Heesu, Kuam is too small for everyone. One beach and one hotel on a small plot, several shops and brothels along the sea wall. In other words, this is a dirt field. - So you have to... - Please. Because long time no see, it's free for Chuljin. Free! I can never free food. Look at that! Kuam has a lot to offer. There's a lot to eat! Of course. Sorry friend! Hey, Damn. So, you went to Youngdo... to get away from the dirt fields? Yes? Are you being silly again? I will go. Hey, Heesu! - What? - You're very drunk tonight. Come to my house. Don't want to. Have fun in your expensive car. I prefer walking. Hey guys! Good night! Good grief... When did you come in? Why are you sleeping on my bench? Aren't you cold? Come here. Not. Do not be like that. Come here. It's hard to get up here, but the view is beautiful. Of course. That's the reason I live here. Wanna stay with me on Geoje Island? Why there? I want to build a hut on Geoje Island. Cottage? What do you mean? Like hotels. Aren't you fed up with hotels? Now you're staying in a hotel. It's so different with Manlijang. The cottage is in place where the air and water are good. You can cook barbecue on the front page, and... And what? Cook a lot of meat, and others. That's weird. What's so strange? This place is at the bottom of the world, but why so high? This is wrong... Penitentiary Come on! Live clean! Morning! Good grief... How could that be... I mean, give me a cigarette. You smell like liquor. Were you drunk last night? - Where's your mother? - He went to the bank. I am hungry. When is he coming home? Why hit me? Is this how we meet again? Shouldn't you greet me after i'm free Please accept. This is an emergency fund. Buy new clothes. Not. I'm not a kid! My hands are sore. Please accept! Half of it from Boss Son. Thank you later. This. Okay thank you. Your mother is a little worried. He hope You left the dark world... and just do something else. I'm planning start something. What? Yangdong asked me to help distributes vodka in Wolnong. I and my friends very interested this time. With Yangdong? Isn't that the dark world? Not, this is really business. Alcohol distribution business. Damn, you're getting better at talking since prison. You can face it Wolnong pimps? They are not easily persuaded. I'm not a kid anymore. I won't be stupid as previously. So don't worry. Of course. You're great. Can I order vodka? I told you to leave, right? Excuse me, you don't understand Korean language? What? Want to order? Do you have money for coffee? Go on, Damn it. Breathe. Hey, come here quickly! Breathe! I said come here! Very few can shared on Kuam. To get that little part, someone has to see the blood. Is OK recovered? How are you? Not good at all. You know the saying? If you don't die from poison, you will die of old age. It's because you drink a lot. Liquor party on the ship... not like drunk in a small room. stroking the chests of women, not like in a strip club. You float on the sea, drinking fine wine, eat good food, and sing poetry. That's the most delicious in this world! Dalja, am I right? The past feels... Mr. Okay, get up. What's that? You know where the cash book is and Yongkang drugs, right? I do not know. How could I know? Say. Than the police got it, we better who got it. If you get Yongkang, will you let me live? What's the point of us killing you? in the laundry, engine number 7 is broken. There's a safe in the motor box, which is behind the engine. The code is... Knock him down! Police What a mess. - Wait. - Do not move! Are you guys in a hurry? I want to defecate. - Yes? - It is over. How long do you think will he go to jail? There's corpses and drugs, So, I guess at least 5 years. In the trunk of a car, there's a box of energy drinks. Drink slowly. Mr. Ok will drink it. Who wrote this? Is there any problem? No, but the writing is bad. It's a mess. Shouldn't we finish problem with Boss Son today? Not. Based on his actions same OK, he would never negotiate. So should we go to war... with Kuam just this trivial thing? Don't underestimate Kuam. This is the end of the world. Everyone is dangerous there. So, if you want part of Kuam, you have to spill blood. That's right, Chuljin, aren't you from Kuam? Yes that's correct. You became successful thanks to Boss Nam. You're a finix that rose from the ashes. Yes. Collecting debt Ok from the pockets of the children at his own funeral? He's dead irresponsibly. I also have to make money. Why is your life such a mess? Do you know does it mean messy life? If you don't pay me, you will understand what it means. - What do you mean? - Are you deaf? My son said... you entered our territory... distribute vodka. Do I force the shops? to buy my stuff? They asked me to send vodka, So, I did that. If you are able, please distribute. Then should we move to Kuam... to open bars and prostitution? What did you say? How dare you! Guys, calm down. Watch your talk. Stupid, wanna crack your head? Watch your talk! - You damn pimp. - What? Pimp? Yes, damn it! Look where you are. You think you have power with the money you make? Boss Nam is here. Welcome, sir. Yes, Heesu, how are you doing? Yeah, this shit hole isn't so... profitable for thugs. Why is Kuam called shit hole? During Japanese rule, this place is the center of Busan. The beach here is always crowded. Isn't that right, Boss Son? Yes indeed. Is that so? I'm too easy to know about the Japanese era... Heesu, let's smoke. What? Why suddenly... Are you really getting married? with Insook? Are you serious? Can I not? I know you guys like each other, since in the shelter, but why now... after these 20 years? Our past was extraordinary. You've grown a little. It was a very clean job. Clean job? What do you mean? kill Ok, involving Yongkang, and imprison him. You're growing a little. From where... Where did you hear that from? Give me a cigarette. Boss. You guys are friends since in the shelter? Yes, we grew up there together. Right. You have a hard life, and become thugs together. I'm sorry, sir. Pay with this. Hong contributed. Ok family will have no money for the funeral. Apart from that, you did a good job. This can help you married with Insook. How's your salted fish shop? You're more like salaried contractor, and it's the same with me, It is not like that? Speak properly. I speak properly! So, if you have any complaints, talk to the elders... Let me go! Damn it! Damn it! Sir. Where have you been? You're invisible. I want to get out of Manlijang at the end of this month. Can you leave us? Are thugs like office workers? You can't go out on your own. Should I cut off one finger or something? What are you going to do? I run a slot machine business with Yangdong. Is he your co-worker now? I keep warning you don't deal with him. Then what? Is it better deal with you? Who feeds you so far? Did I get that free? What? Are you serious? I'm 40 years old! Even if I die, I have to exert influence! Heesu. Later, I will give you Manlijang and other businesses. Why such a hurry? Just forget it! Just give me Manlijang to Flounder. Isn't he your bloodline? Damn it! Are you serious? Yes. I'm serious. Tell Yangdong. If you do business in Kuam, my share is 10%. Payment deadline is the last day of every month. Why did you come out? Is this your only thing? Your life must be light. It's lighter than my stuff when I moved. Come in! You do the laundry? - Just leave it. - Mom, introduce me. Nice to meet you! I'm Jenny. Nice to meet you, too. Sit down. Do you know? When I was in middle school, he beat my teacher. I fight, then the school calls my parents, but my mom is busy, So, he came. Then he beat my teacher. He's great. What did the teacher say? He said he's better teaching chicken than Amy! He made me angry, So, I beat him... Even so, you should don't beat up a teacher, - You stupid. - He deserves a beating! Why is chicken compared with Amy? Didn't you say are you from Seoul? Yes, I'm from Seoul. But while living here, my accent changed to Busan accent. That's weird. Your accent is too good. Yes, you can trick Busan native. - Is that so? - Look at him. He's drunk! 'Is that so?' What are they doing early morning? So what? They are energetic. Get your hands off the ground, Damn it! I have something to say... Nice car, man! When did you buy a new car? It's not mine. This is yours. Come on up! - Mine? - Yes, come on up. But you barely have any money to manage the factory... Come on up! Wait. - Is this really mine? - Of course. Hey, wait! A beautiful day! Enough! I already banned you order food at the office! It is done, right? Reply me! All over this building, anymore who drink and gamble in broad daylight? - Sir. - What? Moneylender Hong... Damn... Put your clothes on, idiot. Mr. Hong, what's the need here? Especially? only money that unites us together. I've thought about it. How about this? I can give IDR 1.25 billion, so let me get involved in your arcade business. As your business partner, I will clear your debt. You need financial support... rather than earn small money from everywhere. We can solve it in a familial manner. You and I family? If not, will you live... with that much debt? When I first started this, I'm not sure it will be successful. But you, God of Money, came to seduce me... Then my business is sure guaranteed success. Let's start again! Keep up your hard work! We will prepare the money for you. Sounds great! Thank you Look after yourself! Mr. park, How much do you need... to build a hut on Geoje Island? I think around Rp6.25 billion. IDR 6.25 billion? When I have enough savings... from this slot machine business, I will leave this shit hole. What is a hut? Tell him. It... It's a place where you can cook barbecue. Right. - Barbecue? - Yes. Noble Karaoke Bar - Heesu! - Yes, man! I think someone is coming. That must be Ami. I'll see. Wait a minute! Yes? What is it? Why are you here? He had to be taken to the ER. There's not much I can do here. Good grief... He was just released A month ago. If found out, he could be jailed for 10 years. I can send another one to the emergency room, but you take care of him yourself, understand, Doctor? Yangdong Distribution Where's Heesu? Everyone here? Get in the car! Heesu, why don't you collect more people? We can't go on with this. Hojung and Park can't be attack recklessly. He's right. They may be supported by Youngdo people. I do not care even though it's Youngdo! Why small talk with thugs who attacked us? Everything is done! They're damn! If we move now, you and I will die! Everything we built so far will perish. You are a coward! After being pushed, we will be dropped into the abyss! If they cut the finger to be used as a weapon, we have to rip our stomachs and use our guts! You understand? Heesu, are you really that stupid? All right, you stay here. Everything is moving! He's just doing what he wants... World Nightclub Come on! Damn, I'm dead. I told you to watch your mouth. One of their people killed? It turns out to be Boss Cheon's nephew. Damn, this can't be fixed? I have to act. In this case, we must imprison someone. Who do you think is worthy? As you know, the victim was my boss' nephew. In the past, this could spark war. So what do you want? With the threat of war against Youngdo, I have to give up. Heesu, show your respect. I brought Mr. Hwang is here to... do not interfere with adult talk. Tell me, Mr. Hwang. Alcohol is another matter, but your arcade business... interfere with our business. We lost a casino client, getting worse. So the point, you do this to take my arcade business? Are we criminals? We don't need to take over someone's business. You need money to make machines... and people to sell. Yes, then what? We will fulfill your needs, so give us stock. Let's just go to war. Partner with Youngdo no gain. War is a choice better. I think you're emotional. How about you calm down and think about this? There is still time. Look after yourself. Are you serious about this? Isn't that obvious? If Youngdo wants something, should i give? So? Are you going to war? Why not? If this business is finished, so is my life. Heesu, I don't mind with anything, but I don't want to fight you. I'm serious. Got fish? Once you start the war, you can't undo it. Some of them... and our people will die, then the death rate will increase until there's nothing left. Then what happen after the war? That's how the negotiations began. Kill Hojung and Park? You think they will care with the dead? Chuljin and I have become friends for 30 years. So, you are willing to die for your old friend? What do you think Youngdo people now? They convinced Chuljin that someone on your level should die, before negotiations begin. Do not forget. in war, those who doubt will lose. Distinguish who floats and who drowned. Let pimp like Hojung and Park floats, and drown Chuljin quietly. Yes, Dad bought bread. Just shut up and drive, or I will slit you. Where should I go take you, sir? What? Are you... Damn it! Damn it! Heesu... I have no grudge against you. Yangdong calls us pimps and humiliate me... Don't hate me. I'm trying my best to keep you alive, but reportedly, this war it won't end if you live. Heesu, this is not war as you think. I know. It's a dog fight. Dog fight? Yes, Boss Son's dog, Park Heesu. I knew I would be bitten by the dog. What do you mean? What? Tell me if I'm wrong. If you're not a dog, why are you in this fight? Just protecting the arcade business? This fight nothing to do with lowly thugs like us. Who is it, then? Boss Nam. What? Boss Nam? He involved Yongkang, and he supplies Yangdong with vodka. What is wrong with him? He's trying to control Kuam. Why is he trying to dominate this bad city? The wharf is closed, So, he can't trade. The dock is moving to a new location, So, everything is closed. All this war over the dock? Yes that's correct. Boss Son knows about this? He knows everything. - Are you serious? - Yes, idiot! What else is the reason he pushes someone to do this business? And you? You knew everything from the start. Why are you silent until everything is messed up? Raise your head, idiot! Reply me! As things calmed down, I asked Nam to hand over big business at least to you. Boss Nam agrees. Heesu here? I brought sashimi. Want to drink? Youre here? Are you from somewhere? I'm from the fish market. Let's have a drink. No, thank you. I feel a little tired. I better go. Didn't you come to me to talk about something? I'm just passing through. Fine, go home. Good night. What did I say? Don't assume Boss Son as an easy foe. Don't worry, Boss Nam. I know Kuam very well, and also Heesu. So? We have given the bait who will soon be arrested. You said Heesu is Boss Son's hound, right? That's right, sir. To face the hounds, let go of the mad dog not a bad idea. Am I right? Penitentiary You look well, sir. I rejoice there. Why did you call me? You want me to dance for you again? Certainly not. Enjoy your few days off. Okay. Take me anywhere. When I was in prison, there's a mouse toying with the boss. You are wrong. The old man ordered, So, I took it a little. Just a contractor. You see the bag here? Bag? I don't see. Do you like sea urchins? What? Eat this one will stimulate your memory. If you don't remember, you can eat again. there are still many, So, you can eat until you remember. Boss! Open wide, here it is! What's that? I thought he was going to jail at least 5 years. Am I the one who decides? the punishment? I'm not a judge. But the evidence is lacking? Drugs found! His release is not a legal issue. He was helped by someone in power. - Who? - Who do you think? Someone who wants to see him rampage in the city. Thanks for the coffee. Boss, Jungbae's weakness been attacked. He was stuffed with sea urchins. His mouth was crushed. Can't we negotiate with Yongkang? Negotiation? Didn't you say something finger cutting and fight with our gut? Now is the time. You know what this is? I used to fight with him, and he did this to me. He was 15 years old at the time. How can someone so young do something like this? He's not human. Heesu. Sorry, I can't do this again. Yangdong. Why are you here? You look gloomy. Chuljin. What? I do all your requests. I even killed Boss Cheon's nephew... Sir! Watch your mouth. Someone can hear. It is not like that. He appeared in my dream. I can't sleep lately. Hang on. Once this is done, there will be no bars in Busan who gets alcohol without your permission. Nam really know about this? Don't be so pathetic. I will treat you in a good place. What's the total? The total is Rp. 125,000. Jenny, hit it over the rope. Get over here? Yes, give it a try. You sure can! Do not try anything with me with Jenny. Your mother left this for you. Hey! Mr. Park here! - Welcome. - Pleased to meet you. How's your wound? Okay, it's not much. Until when should we hide? We are so bored. It's a life and death situation and are you bored? Aren't you scared? I'm not afraid with Youngdo's hoodlums. I can withstand the stab. But hunger and boredom which torments me a lot. Yes, Ami really can't stand it with hunger. Good grief. Come here. Ami, promise me one thing. What? Whatever happens, don't fight with Youngdo. Even if I get stabbed and die, understand? Don't lose control and try revenge. I have to be quiet even though you were stabbed and died? Yes. Don't do anything. I'm serious. Reply me! I understand. Eat with kimchi. Eat with us! Mr. Park! What? Can I ... Can I call you dad? What? Dad? If you sleep with my mother, aren't you my dad? Right... But I'm too young... What? You're not ready yet? No, call me daddy! Because now you have handsome son, buy us steak. They are so weak if you don't eat meat Do you call me daddy for me to buy you a steak? I have self-respect. What for did I do it for the steak? Of course not. Of course! When I come again, I'll buy you a steak! Be careful on the way! - Look after yourself! - Bye! It's a fight between Boss Nam and Son. With pimp Wolnong's involvement and traders like us, there will be no good results. Then what? Let's think beautiful result. It's a cool story about how loser from shelter be king. Are you interested? Nam just needs a dock. Son will never let go of the pier. It means war will not end. But if one of them goes everyone is happy. Nam will get the dock, Cheon will get Wolnong, and Kuam financiers will earn a lot of money. And you... You will be the king of Kuam. With Son's death, can I master Kuam? Of course. Youngdo supports you. Why not? This is the plan that Youngdo started with Flounder... Wait a moment... Flounder knows about this? What are you asking? Was Son stabbed instead of Flounder? Youngdo will stab him, and also clean up. You just need to be quiet and dominate Manlijang. You think I will do such a thing? Of course. You're very capable of that. You know the reason? Because you look so much like me! How can I look like you? You hate yourself, but not jealous of the others. A man like you will end in two places. Either fall to the bottom of hell, or rise to become king! Shut up! 'Cause I'm about to fall, I'm really going down! Heesu, where are you headed? What would you do? Do what? Don't play dumb. Either give up the dock or kill Boss Nam, should not did you do something? Isn't killing also an option? Why? It didn't occur to you? It will be cleanest choice. Are you kidding? Or do you not believe me? Do you know why this war will never end? Why? Because you behave like a fool. I told you, people like Chuljin must die before we negotiate. But why you don't hear me? Some of our people died because of your loyalty. I don't know how much more who will die, but don't hate me. Heesu. Please accept this. What's this? I bought it as Insook's wedding gift. I better give it to you earlier. Put it on him. Thank you Insook will love it! Ladies, stay here a moment. Just a moment! Let's go. They're good men. Trust me. Okay. Let's sit here for a moment. Come here. We can get to know each other later. - Cheers! - Cheers! You're very good at drinking. You're much sexier when viewed up close. How about a kiss? Passionate! You are crazy? Get out of the way! Honey, stop that. He has a girlfriend. What did you say? Then why are you following matchmaking at the club? And why are you drinking miras mahalku? - Are you here for a drink? - What? Damn ... Damn whore, are you crazy? Love... Who's doing this? Amy! - Good night, sir. - Mr. Parks. Here, I brought the steaks for you. - Thank you. - Thank you. Where's Amy? You see... Where's Dongchil? Where is she? - Hello? - Chuljin, it's me! Hey, what's wrong? Have you heard of Dongchil? Cho Dongchil. Cho Dongchil? Who knows. He lives in Youngdo. Can you find him? - I'm in a hurry. - Okay. I don't know what happened, but i will check. Go. Give me a cigarette! Stupid people! Who is Dongchil? What's the matter, idiot? You're that ugly bitch's girlfriend? You are stupid! Come here, idiot! How? Not there? I didn't see it. Wait. Where have you been? Oh. Hang on. Don't tell mom about this. This is our secret. What do you mean? Son, be aware! Stabbed by the bastards it's embarrassing, but i can't control my body. Do not talk. Shut up. Hang on. I'll call an ambulance... Father... Yes, what? Please take care of my mom... Damn it! Amy... Amy. Hey, man. Open your eyes. Amy! Amy! Open your eyes! Hey, Amy! I will submit vodka business and... Wolnong area the problem with you. I will bear the nephew and I gave up my business. In that case, will you end the war? Boss Nam also wants share a pier. The dock problem should be discussed with Boss Son. You should consult him. We didn't come all the way here just to hear that. Who's that? - Yes? - It's me, Boss. It was indeed Cho Chuljin's doing. Okay. Heesu, boss ordered us to get to the dock or get your head. But if you insist, what can i do? Is that why you killed Ami? What do you mean? Ami is Insook's son. Why are you doing this on us? You call yourself human? Come on, shoot me. Shoot. Cho... Cho... Are you okay? Parasites. You want to be my boss forever, right? Honestly I'm scared. I'm afraid of you and Ami. Father... Amy, wake up. Heesu, I don't mind with anything, but I don't want to fight you. I'm serious. Damn it! Are you serious? Heesu, where are you going? Are you awake? I'm sorry about Amy. If he doesn't die, you must die. You understand? So, you're the mastermind? How can I plan this big plan? Many parties want part and get involved. So, everyone cooperates. And you? Kill everyone and be the boss? Honestly, I don't care about being the boss. I just wanna breathe, eat, and live with my children. When this ends, come back to Manlijang and rule Kuam. Nothing can I believe here, but our friendship it's been 30 years. This ship is heading to Russia tonight. If you wanna get down, tell them. Otherwise, they will throw you away in the Bering Sea. I heard it's cold in here. Think about it. Got something? If you're here, Heesu must be dead. No, he's fine. Then he betrayed me by your side? Heesu will be sad if he hears that, but in the end, this is betrayal. He's not what he usually is. There's nothing to do this matter. Chuljin, treat him well. What do you mean? At that time, I ordered it to kill you, but he can't and this is how it goes. Never forget that. I understand. - What's wrong with you? - Get out of the way, you idiot! Hey! Let him in. Stay outside. Go out! I want to see you before leaving. Good, you're awake. What happened with your men? My men? Listen, Mr. Park. We may not meet when you left Kuam, but don't live like this. What do you mean? Are you pretending to be stupid? My men are in hiding, and Boss Son was stabbed. He could die at any time because you betrayed us! Many people are after you. Be careful at night. Why did you do that? I heard... Ami could have stayed alive. Him and you can stay alive. It is not like that. So, Ami died to keep his father alive? It's not like that at all. So what? Tell me, what? Insook, wait. Amy... Before he died, Ami asked me to take care of you. Hear. We've come this far. We have to stay alive. It used to be when I left to Wolnong for prostitution, you told me, 'Let's escape to Seoul together.' You know why me don't go with you? Why? I can't trust you. then or now, you never give me a reason to trust you. Take your hand away. Youngdo people can be attack the hospital. So, we brought him here. Didn't you lose the bag here? If you're still alive, you conspired with Youngdo and stabbed Son. By bringing back this bag, It means you want something from me. So say what you want. 24 year old man dead without good reason. He calls me daddy, even though we are not blood related. He died because of me. You want revenge? As his father... I have to do something. Everything is set, so you just follow. Everything depends on you. Okay. You've arrived. Pleased to meet you like this again! Of course. - How are you doing? - Of course. Let? Let's all drink. Kuam Bosses, please pour a drink. Yes, of course. I'm not good with words, so, just short. Let's stop fighting and make peace like a real man. Anyone object? I assume no one has any objections. If anyone brings up past, I will not be silent. Because we've made peace, let's raise a glass. Cheers! - Cheers! - Cheers! I also heard Boss Park unwell today, So, I prepared a small gift. Bring it here. Heesu, I assigned famous wild ginseng digger, and it is very difficult to get one. I also prepared a gift for Heesu. Can I give it to him now? Accept it. This is a small gift. What's that? Is that really your gift? This is a cruel world. To protect something, you need something like that. Heesu, what do you want do you protect? In the past, there was something I protected, but while living in the gutter, I forgot what it was. Boss Park, what are you doing? What? I think you'll like this. Nothing will stop you, and there won't be that brought you down. This is good for you too. This will be bloodshed. Can you face it? Why? You're not ready? Heesu, promise me one thing. What? If the war really starts, no one knows does it take a year or a decade, but until the war is over, we can't betray each other. Can you promise that? Of course. Chuljin. In the next life, I hope we are not born at the shelter, but born of a good father. A father, rich and powerful. Too bad. All dads... no one has power. Anyone want it I ask you. Why don't you choose me as your partner? Someone I know told me that good people will not win in the end, but it is the wicked who win. So? Boss Cheon, you're the best bad guy in this city. Damn it. You can clearly read people. You're so excited... make money by selling fake chili. But this is how it ends. It is all over, so go in peace. Doing business is not easy, right? Not easy at all! Nothing is easy in this world. Don't try to play too clean. What do you mean? Business is a dirty thing. If you try too clean, you will be overwhelmed. So... work like you? Damn, I'm giving you advice. Yes, what? Their butts can hurt if you keep looking. Pleased to meet you. Had lunch? - I ate a lot. - Look after yourself. Boss! President Park Heesu Boss, we found Flounder. - Where is she? - He's in Cambodia. Pull over here. Should I send some people to Cambodia? Not. Let him live. He can cause trouble. It is okay? But he's the last bloodline of that man. Go. The weather is cold. Come back soon! Someone once said, a man like me will end in two places. Falling to the bottom of hell, or rise to kingship. Then he said, both in place very lonely and meaningless. Some of us die and the others leave. All hot disappear. Everything went quiet... and meaningless like a ghost. But we play... and stay alive. With our feet in the ocean shame and suffering... DITERJEMAHKAN ULANG | YOYONG PAGES
