I've known Ted since he was a kid I'll stick my hand in the fire for him Even stick my head in That does your heart great credit,Mr Pearson Sorry Sir I must say I've always considered Hutchens completely trustworthy What about the girl? I've seen her a quiet little blonde Quiet? Why? I haven't actually spoken to her Yet you know Hutchens very well Well,he must have just met her What about that accent This is nonsense Nothing in my job is nonsense,Mr Pearson At this moment it could very well be maybe two or three foreign agents within these walls Who are they? I don't know Is it Fred the commissioner, is it the ambassador's valet Is it you,Mr Pearson? Or you,Sir? Or is it Hutchens? I've been out shopping Come as soon as you can I've got things to carry on I will Come in -Yesterdays log,Sir -Thank you You missed a great party last night Yes,sorry about that I..

That doctor is an idiot It's you who are an idiot I told you over and over again to give up smoking You talk like a nagging wife He said I could have one after every meal He said nothing of the sort He said:Don't let him smoke His heart can't stand it I did not know that public monuments had hearts? Anna We are very much alike,you and I We both know the best way to wound each other Do not see this man again You want all the world to be happy Only not me Will betraying your world make you happy? Or will you give up your beliefs and your country Or will he for your sake gave up his? Anna Would you want such a man? I love him Anna,the world is divided in two And you cannot escape that fact by running away from it And is there any place to which you could run? No third place Do not see him again If you do I will have to send you home Home? Promise me you'll not see him again I promise Anna Don't you trust me? I promise -Mr Hutchens? -Yes But what "Dearest Ted" "I can't ever see you again" "There was never anything we could do" "I knew that" "In my heart I always knew it" " My father is very ill" "And I am to blame" Anna Pearson,can I have a word with you please Yes,Sir Moffatt had just rung me It seems Hutchens girlfriend maybe the daughter of Anton Szobek Szobek? Someone from their legation delivered a note to Hutchens this evening I want to give the boy the benefit of a doubt but Could you without arising his suspicions see that noting important passes through his hands for the time being? Yes of course,Sir I'm sure there's nothing in it I hope you're right Good night Good night,Sir Leave those,I must read them No,you're half asleep already Call for Miss Szobek,Sir,it's Mr Hutchens Yes Anna,I've got your note, you must listen to me It'll be all right,I promise Did you speak to your father, I know he'll understand Anna,say something Please,speak to me,Anna Good night My child There is a call for Miss Szobek,Sir Switch it through Miss Szobek's number,leave me on the line Yes Anna I knew I'll see you one day I came back to life for a few minutes I've been dead for a long time,my love Five weeks,four days,six hours and thirty two minutes to be exact Anna Say something Anna are you there?

Yes I suppose so And the young man? He doesn't know,he never will Your father must be told Yes But not by you By me when I'm ready You know what he'll do What you'll have to do Yes I know what he will do -Good bye,doctor -Good bye,my dear You know what he'll do, what he'll have to do Put it through There an outside call for Mr Hutchens,Sir Right Hello,could I speak to Mr Hutchens,please Ted,there's an outside call for you Oh,heck I'm busy,who is it?

Yes I I don't quite know where to begin Why not begin with meeting the American in the book shop Your promises are not worth very much,are they? But father you don't understand I don't understand? For five weeks that man does not communicate with you and there is a crisis between his world and ours Do you think it is an accident that he calls you And makes love to you on the telephone And that you in the sickness of your infatuation go to meet him But this action alone you've betrayed me And if this American has such power over you mind Who can say to what further follies, even treachery,you can be linked But we love each other Don't make excuses There is no excuse You are my daughter I represent our country here Please,please,don't preach be human just for five minutes You're going back home Back to school I knew you would say that What else is there for me to say! Please,father, listen to me, don't shut your heart I'm going to have a baby You poor child I don't want pity You must go home What sort of man is this A man I love Love Something you've forgotten about if you ever knew it And now you destroy it for me as you did for mother How dare you How dare you mention her name in the same breath as this Squalid affair You can't begin to understand her How she suffered and fought and waited and never gave way Never one complaint You say that I preach That I'm inhuman That I can love only in the abstract I loved the things she died for The people she died for She starved herself so you might live You! I'm sorry Anna Anna haven't you better go home? Now Even tonight Couldn't I Couldn’t I -Yes -Messenger was here,Sir Message from Miss Szobek to Mr Hutchens Albermarle hotel,quote "Tell him I'm leaving tonight I have to go home" That is all Thanks Well,she's going,that's all right isn't it? It's sounded final Yes it sounded final But not very like a parting message of love They settled all that in a book shop this afternoon If that is so,Mr Pearson doesn't that strike you as odd that she send him this further bleak little message informing him what he must have known already You said it sounded final So it does to me The final notice Look this isn't good enough, I want this thing cleared out quick Its your job,Moffatt,and I want to know what you propose to do about it You have I understand a special courier touching down at London airport on the way from Frankfurt to New York this evening Give Hutchens what appears to be a highly confidential verbal communication to take to him Why verbal Because he knows very well that any tampering with sealed envelope would be detected And before he leaves here See that someone gives him Miss Szobek's message I suggest the commissioner If he doesn't try to contact Miss Szobek,well and good If he does well A trap Yes Mr Pearson,a trap But only for a guilty man -Oh Mr Hutchens your car is ready -Thanks And I have a telephone message here for you,from your hotel Oh thanks,Fred Ditto,hear Mr Hutchens has just driven off in Embassy car JAK 711 Driver Richards,heading west,I'm following him JAK 711 heading west down Knightsbridge And JaK 711 turning left Down Wilton Place I suppose JAK 711 turning left down Wilton Place Stop on the corner here,will you?

A little better -I asked you a question -I am a doctor For me the individual is more important than the masses So it's,thank heaven quite inconceivable that ' I shall ever be in your place You're a moral coward I'm necessary as such Otherwise how should the world know that you are a moral hero No one else speaks to me like that Except Anna The minister is engaged There he goes But Sir -Mr Szobek -Yes? What can I do for you? -My name is Ted Hutchens -So I understand -May I see Anna? -You may not She hasn't gone yet,has she?

Yes You knew who Miss Szobek was,you knew it was your duty to report such contacts I've given you every opportunity a man could have I've risked putting the entire department under investigation I trusted you But tonight you proved once and for all I was wrong No Sir It's not true I had to see Miss Szobek tonight I am in love with her They are sending her away and I may never see her again Can any of you understand? I love her and I love my country,can't you believe that? Have you all become so blind with fear and suspicion and you can't see the simple truth You'll be flown back to Washington tonight Mr Pearson will stay with you until you're ready to leave Look I got to see her couldn't you You're not going anywhere,come on But it's crazy,you know it's crazy You can't believe I'll tell her anything?
