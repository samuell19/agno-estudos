I apologize for causing you so much trouble Come, Miss Sakami Did you introduce yourself to him? This is Keiko Sakami. She lives with me She's pretty, but very eccentric but very eccentric Teacher... She's an art student... more of the abstract school Her work often reveal something frighteningly passionate Yet it fascinates me I wish I could paint like that She trembles with passion when she's working This is quite a pleasant surprise I knew you'd enjoy young company We get older as each New Year rolls around How depressing! I never thought I'd live to be my age How long does it take for them to strike the bell 108 times? I'm not sure, but I think it takes a little more than an hour They'll start in a few minutes then You're not used to sake. Sip it slowly You came all the way just to hear the bell? There aren't many like you You may see her from afar But don't go near my daughter I don't want you to see her the way she is now Besides, Your presence will disturb her Will she recognize me? She certainly will You've driven her to where she is The doctor says she'll be all right He says the derangement is only temporary She wants to caress her baby She thinks it was still alive I know you have a wife and a son So does my daughter What I'm going to say to you may well upset you You'll think I'm crazy, too Will you marry my daughter? I asked myself the same question many times ...seriously You think I'm crazy, don't you? I don't mind I'm not going to ask you again You don't have to marry her right now She's my daughter. She can wait She's only seventeen now Some time ago, I saw your art work in a gallery It was very beautiful and peaceful When you come home to Tokyo, please call on me I want to see your Crazy, abstract paintings Please send some of them to me How embarrassing! I'm just one of her pupils I'm afraid I've spoiled your New Year's Day Historic Town of Kamakura, near Tokyo THE BITTER SEVENTEEN By Ohki You're up very early I must attend Prof. Essor Takeda's seminar Feed me. I'm famished I'll look after him Moring Where are you going? Just for a walk It was many years ago Otoko's mother wrote to me about the miscarriage My wife read the letter and found out what I did to the girl She called me a demon. She bit her tongue After Otoko left me... I wrote all about her in a novel... The Bitter Seventeen. My wife volunteered to typewrite everything I wrote about the girl Although she'd asked for it, it was a blow to Fumiko She became a different person Go away, Taichiro I shouldn't have let you read this. I'm sorry You shouldn't be You let me because you had confidence in me Now I know all about Otoko and what you did to her You're a novelist You need all these things to write about As a loyal wife, I should congratulate you It's fiction, not the real Otoko I know A girl like that couldn't be real I wish you'd written more about me in this novel I wouldn't mind if you made me look after a jealous demon But you're not that kind of wife Besides, I didn't want to expose my family affairs Liar! You're still crazy about that young girl You didn't want to write about me You thought it would spoil her beauty And spoil your work, too! Do novels always have to be so clean and tidy? A young girl from Kyoto came to see you She brought two pictures and wheat cakes as presents Where is she? Our son went out with her, probably to look for you She was frighteningly beautiful Who is she? She is paint pupil Otoko painted them No, not Otoko the young girl did Here's her signature: Keiko Very unusual Yes, very unusual What is she to Otoko? One of her pupils Let me tear up these pictures What's the matter with you? Both of them describe Otoko with devotion We mustn't leave them here This? Otoko? Don't you see? Notice this peculiar glow over here That represents the undying love Otoko has for you What gives you such an idea? You're imaging things Say what you will. I know I'm right What's keeping our son? It's been hours since he left with the girl I pray he won't be the next victim Her beauty was almost uncanny Tea is ready Will you join me? The moon is up and the air is very cool I'm stuck Because your lost baby haunts you Don't say that Wow! The air is very cool Sorry! Are you feel cool? You don't understand you What do you mean? I've been reading this... again Where did you get this? At a book store I told you. I don't want you to read it It's no use I can buy another copy anytime Very good You were 16 when you met him He was an up-and-coming writer, he had a wife and a son So what? That was 15 years ago You bore him a baby But the baby died soon after birth You look an overdose of sleeping pills After that... for almost six months... You were confined in an iron-barred room of an asylum I told you I'd forgotten everything No, you didn't If you had, why did you send me for Mr. Ohki? You even told me to see him off Because you're young and beautiful And because I'm proud of you You can fool others but not me Never! Ever since you saw him again, I've been watching you... With jealous eyes Think what he's done to you Destroy his home and settle the score I would if I were you I man's home is very hard to destroy Harder than art? I don't know I'll punish him for you You mean vengeance What for? I don't understand Otherwise, you can't stop loving him for the rest of your life You love him That's why you're doing that picture... Ascension of an Infant. I just have to get revenge Why? Because I'm jealous Don't you see? I know everything He mustn't get away How do you prose to punish him? What are you going to do? Who did you meet in Kamakura? Ohki's son. His name is Taichiro Ohki must have been just like him when he was young A young scholar... specializing in ancient Japanese literature Taichiro was very nice to me He took me to all the historic places... even Enoshima Island You were born in Tokyo You know all these places Are you going to punish Ohki by making Taichiro yours? Or, do you want to be his? I'm afraid I'm the one who ought to be jealous Are you jealous? How nice! I could be a femme fatale and a devil to anyone except you It would be very easy to seduce Ohki or his son You frighten me But... Please don't talk like that... No matter how beautiful you are Why not? Every woman is a born devil and a seductress Now I know why you gave your pictures to Ohki I wouldn't need such things The vengeance is yours Don't you hate him? I don't Is it love? Maybe You're cruel It's getting chilly out here. Shall we go? I'm yours... body and soul Ohki can't get away with what he did to you Please forgive him and me I was just a child of 16, going on 17 You must let me punish him Maybe you can destroy him... But not my love for him Let me pose for you... Before I become what you call a seductress In the nude if you want Were you watching me? Yes... for a while I'm embarrassed It was just a dream It was a figure... a green figure A green monster! Don't be silly It looked like a human... in green Almost floating in the air, it kept circling around Was it a woman? Maybe it was you You keep haunting me, don't you? How frightening! You hurt me Because I wanted to No... you shouldn't You taught me everything... The way Ohki must have taught you That's why I must punish him No! Please don't You're like a fire! You have a visitor from Kyoto. Miss Sakami Shall I tell her you're busy? A young girl? Yes, sir. She was here sometimes ago Show her in How are you I'm find The last time you were here, I was out for a walk I wish you had stayed Your son took me out and showed me around Oh? The sun was setting over the sea. It was beautiful Oh? I didn't know he took you to the beach I've brought another picture for you That's right. Just for you I'm not too familiar with abstract art Your pictures are hung in my son's study Is he home today? No. He's attending a special literature class My wife's off to a puppet show I'm glad you're alone I can be very realistic once in a while. A plantation of tea It looks like an angry sea Full of youth and energy At first I thought... It symbolized bursting young energy You're so right! That was exactly what I meant So young! The real tea plantation is much more gloomy I wanted it to be gay and passionate... not gloomy After Miss Ueno... you must have had many affairs I know You're right Nothing as tragic as it was with Otoko Why don't you write about them? They don't want me to and I'm too old to let them down As a writer, maybe I should When I wrote about Otoko, I forgot everything. I can't now You can write about me the way you want to I'm a writer, not a painter It takes more than posing in the nude You must sacrifice yourself, and there's no reward I love to sacrifice myself for something... Or for someone That's all I have to live for You'll be a very demanding sacrifice Demanding enough to destroy people No. You're wrong Sacrifice is love... adoration Whom are you sacrificing now? Otoko? Perhaps I was But a woman can't live in sacrifice for another woman forever It's so morbid I wouldn't know It would eventually destroy both of us I don't want to waver Even for a few days... I want something to make me forget myself Let's go before it starts raining Please! It's such fun Whenever a school of dolphin is sighted offshore... Naked men jump into the water and catch them with their hands The fish can't resist being tickled Can you? Shame on you! I'll bite and scratch I should have stuck to dolphin Now the rain has turned into snow We'll have to spend the night here The traffic has stopped Your kimono's wet Take a hot bath Let's see if you're a dolphin I really ought to resent it. I'm not a dolphin Must you humiliate me like that? The sea is so dark I didn't mean it. Sorry At least you could have said, Let me look at you. Why don't you just hold me tight? Will you let me? I don't know But I'm not a dolphin I expect some respect Do you know what that means? Respect? I've run a fresh bath for you The tub's almost full Large flakes melt soon I can't see anything. It's all so dim Sad? The sea is ugly You'll catch a cold Why don't you take a bath? This pomade had an awful smell How about this perfume? To apply to my hair? You don't want? Don't put on makeup Mr. Ohki I want to see you the way you are Your beautiful teeth... and your eyebrows No. Don't leave me I'm not a sea diver I'm out of breath Smother me I'll be dead before you are Not the left one Why not? It's not for you Not for me? I don't want you to touch it Is it only for someone very special to you? Who? There is no such person My Otoko! Mr. Otoko! I like your picture of the tea plantation You gave it to Ohki, didn't you? I'm sure Mrs. Ohki has torn it to pieces by now I spent a night with him at a hotel Why? I don't understand I want to destroy him... and his home I hate him because you still love him I couldn't sleep But he was sound asleep beside me... snoring He's a stupid, old man I could have strangled him to death easily Exciting, isn't it? I don't want you to see him again No good will come for it Didn't you ever wish that he was dead? No... not with the baby I lost I don't understand I could easily have a baby by him And I could destroy him after that What's the matter? You're so pale You're hurting me You're everything I have in this world Everything! Do you want to be unhappy... For the rest of your life? Why not? I can even enjoy unhappiness I hate men I wish I could take your word for it Let me look at your sketch book What's that? Do you have to ask? It's the Moss Temple The way I saw it I see You did have an affair with Ohki An affair? What gave you such an idea? The way you paint All right. You know something? He couldn't even give me a long kiss Are all men like that? I don't know anyone else Let's play dolphin Play dolphin? Dolphin? Will you change? What are you doing there? I'll have a baby by Ohki And dedicate it to you How nice! Give me more You are a monster Why? I didn't say the baby was for me It's going to be yours No matter how much you love him... You can't bear him a child I can... without any attachment Keiko Your bath is ready It's been a nasty day... very dusty I can use a bath Is anything wrong? Is anything wrong? Go ahead Take a good look at me Are you going out? No This is nice. Why don't you join me? Where are you? Why don't you wash up? I don't have to I owe you an apology. Please forgive me And forgive me, too What are you doing there? I'm dressing Are you going out? Where? Are you going out? Where? I have no idea Let me go with you Do you mind? No. I'll wait for you All right. I'll be ready in a minute Shall we go to the restaurant in Kiyamachi? Call and reserve a room I'll fetch you some cold water Am I sweating? Don't worry. I'm not throwing anything at you It's so nice! Your skin is too clean. You shouldn't have taken a bath Do you feel any better? That depends on how you feel about me Tell me about your saddest experience so far Let me see... There are so many... Perhaps I'll tell you later My saddest doesn't last though I brush it off quickly Please promise me one thing Don't see him any more You mean Ohki? Or his son? Neither of them I want to see Ohki to even the score for you I have nothing against him Will you let me? You want kill him I will Don't talk like that What's with you? You scare me You're a coward Coward I have exciting news for you A big ratjust ran behind the stove A very small baby was with him You should have seen them Look at the baby rat She's looking up at me. How charming Those beautiful, shining eyes! She's courting me Look! The roof leaks... above the kitchen Do you hear it? No What about the leak? How bad is it? I'll go up the roof tomorrow No. You're an old man I'll have Taichiro do it An old man am I? You reached the retirement age long ago I did? Wonderful! I'll take it easy from now on Suit yourself Do writers have a retirement age? Not till you're dead Yes, you are right I'm sorry I meant to say you had many days ahead of you Coming from my wife, it's quite a burden Did I ever nag you? But you've been in my way What? You're a jealous wife Women are born jealous Jealousy is a bitter pill to take... sometimes it's fatal It's scorched How stupid of me! I'm a lousy cook It's a miracle that you've put up with me for 20 years I don't even know how to make soup properly Now you're mad I'm not I'm just talking about the miso soup It's the soup every Japanese eats practically every morning And I can't make it properly. So you're disturbed The fault is all mine Isn't Taichiro up yet? Wake him up I'm afraid I can't He said he'd enjoy his spring vacation I can't disturb him He's leaving for Kyoto today He's going by air... this evening Why Kyoto? Why don't you ask him? He just wants to visit the graves of Sanetaka and his family He's doing a treatise on Sanetaka's diary You're late I stayed in bad awake... Enjoying my thoughts They excavated Princess Kazu's grave Princess Kazu's grave? It was purely for scientific purposes You know how these things happen But she hasn't been dead for so many years When did she die? It was in 1877 That's less than 100 years ago But the Princess was all bones You'd better wash up first But she was in there like an innocent child sleeping Very happy and peaceful Beside the bones... There was a lock of hair beside the bones And the hair looked very fresh and alive Taichiro Yes Later, perhaps Between her arms... A small glass plate was found, the size of a name card That was the only thing she had with her The purpose of excavation was purely historical No room for sentimentality But a man got curious about the glass plate He took it with him He though it was a wet plate Wet plate? You mean a glass photograph Yes, a very old one Very old one In those days, there was no dry film or prints Yes, I remember I saw some of them Anyway, he took it to his laboratory and examined it He could see a dim image The image of a man It was a photograph It showed a young man dressed for a ceremony Was he the Shogun, her husband? Probably The Princess was known to be very virtuous But the image was very dim He tried everything to make it clearer, but he couldn't The next morning, he looked at it again in the sunlight The image was all gone It had become a transparent plate Such things can happen. It had been three for a long time That's right Naturally he was terribly disappointed He wrote all about it in an essay. He said... It could have been the image of someone else She'd been in love with Prince Arisugawa before she was married She might have wanted to be buried with the man she really loved Princess Kazu's grave... It might have been her last wish That's more like the tragic princess What do you think? It's anybody's guess Maybe he was right The missing image would be a very good ending to a tragedy You can write about it I'm afraid it's not for me But it's good material... For an impressive short story Maybe what the man wrote about it would be enough Anyway, it's a fascinating story I have his book in my study Will you read it? And the Princess's remains? What did they do with them? I hope she's safely back in her grave The man said nothing about it She probably is But not with the image of the man she really cared for I'm sorry for the Princess I never thought of it If you wrote about it, would you mention it? No. It's too sentimental You still have to work I'm going out for a walk to forget what he told me You're supposed to look after the leaking roof A moment ago, you were sorry for the Princess Now you want me to mend the roof Our son's going to Kyoto Do you think we should let him? Why shouldn't we? I don't think I follow you I'm sure you do. While he was talking about the Princess... I was thinking about his going to Kyoto He's visiting the grave of a nobleman dead for hundreds of years No. He's going to Kyoto to see that girl She's up to something Don't you see? I have an eerie feeling about it It's early spring. It thundered last night He's going by air What if lightening strikes his plane? Don't be a fool There never was such an accident No, Please don't Not the left one That's not for you I don't want you to touch it My Otoko! I watched you walking down the ramp You were the seventh Was I? Yes, you were You kept watching your steps You never bothered to look for me I wished I hadn't some to meet you I was so ashamed of myself I wasn't expecting you Why not? You told me the flight number I did because I needed courage to see you Courage to see me? Should I be flattered or humiliated? All right. Forget it As I watched you getting off the plane... You looked so terribly gloomy and Ionesome I was sorry for you You didn't even imagine that I'd be there to meet you You should have looked for me I'm very selfish What can I do... To make you realize that I exist? I've always been thinking about you You have? Am I really sitting next to you? I still can't believe it I want to make sure it's really you Speak to me And your schedule tomorrow? First, I'll go to Nison-in Temple... And visit Sanetaka's grave Grave? May I go with you? I'd rather go to Lake Biwa for a boat ride, though It doesn't have to be tomorrow In early Spring? I never drove a motorboat Leave it to me Can you swim, Keiko? If the boat turns turtle... You must save me You will, won't you? I'll hang on to you anyway You shouldn't We'd both be drowned that way What should I do? I'll be behind you... With my arms under your elbows I'd love that! I'm not sure if I can save you What if you couldn't? Forget it. I'm not going to take you for a boat ride But it's absolutely safe I've been looking forward to it Will you reconsider? Can you help me? Are you going out? Do you have an appointment? Yes. With Taichiro Ohki's son. Remember? I'll show him the sights May be it's the other way around We'll go to Nison-in Temple to visit some graves on the hill It's a mess. Tidy it up Keiko! Come here! Wait for breakfast I had a late supper last night Last night? What are you going to do? I don't know You've arranged this date. Why? I don't want you to see him. Please don't But it has nothing to do with you It has You don't even know him You spent a night with Ohki at a hotel Now you're dating his son True you were in love with Ohki But his son has nothing to do with you He isn't your son But you're intimate enough to show him the sights We're friends. That's all What kind of friends, if I may ask? You are a monster! He's a man And I hate men Don't go. Please don't see him If you must see him... Don't ever bother to come back here! What are you going to do to him? I have to go. I must No... There's no one here but us This place is famous but not popular I don't know why Look at that tree on the left That's an ilex, almost a thousand years old Can you climb up these steps? I don't think so... Help me Carry me on your back There's no hurry Is the grave up there? Yes. It's at the top of these stone steps You came all this way to visit the grave... Not to see me Unflattering but true You'd better wait for me here I can climb these steps. It's easy Even if they reach heaven These are the graves of the Sanjo family Sanetaka's is on the far right The Minister of the Inner Court It's very small for the grave of a nobleman Yes. It's very unpretentious. And I love it for that It looks very friendly I'm interested in his life He was among the first in Japan to embrace art It is all very fascinating You've been studying it for years? Well... it's been three... or, maybe, four years This grave is your source of inspiration? Inspiration? This grave means a lot to you Make it mean a lot to me, too... With fond memories You're always attracted to this place It's not a grave any more Maybe it has acquired a new meaning after hundreds of years I can't hear you I said you're right. This isn't a grave any more What did you say? Yet, you're so close to me Your breath... it tickles me You're breathing in my ear. That's not nice No? My ears are very sensitive It's like a strange flower Do you hear anything? What? What is it? A bee trying to rest on a flower? Maybe it is a butterfly I'm touching it softly Do you like touching female ears? Do you? No, but I've never seen such a pretty ear The wind is very still No winds. Just full of sunshine Early in the morning... You embraced me before a grave I'll cherish this memory Now I have something to remember this place by You'll soon forget all this I know you will And it hurts How could I forget? I don't want to be hurt No! Not the lips You're hurting me Now you're pressing my eye Which eye? The right Does it still hurt? Yes, I'm sure it's full of tears I can kiss your eyes but not your lips I resent that. You're getting mean It's very big I must change into a suit Change? Aren't we going to Lake Biwa? My eyes are still hazy You must take my hand There's another place to go. It's up there Must we go up again? All right. Why don't we cover the top? I wouldn't mind if I went bare-footed Have a heart. I'm in Kimono Let's see... I don't care No, Not the right one If you touch it, I'll be very unhappy Why? I don't know Maybe because it's not close to my heart Every girl has her own peculiarities But they all become ordinary women That's sad, isn't it? No. Not the cup I want it from you I like it very much I'm so happy that I can die Why didn't you poison me? I'm not what I used to be. I'm not good I'm finished, Taichiro Don't look at me How careless of me! I'm a stupid fool What you need is a bath I'll run it for you At least you can take a shower Am I sweaty? I like it I never knew who smelled so good But you want to wash up, don't you? Please come out of the bathroom You're wanted on the telephone Telephone? For me? But no one knows we're here Who is it? It must be a mistake It's your mother Yes. She's on the phone I called her I told her that we were staying at this hotel I told her you promised to marry me... And I asked for her consent Taichiro! Are you there? Don't go through with it You know very well what kind of a girl she is I wonder if your mother knows what she is saying Are you there, Taichiro? Is there someone else? Of all the nerve! You should have heard what she just said Did she make you call me? You come home right this minute Do you hear? Right this minute! She's eavesdropping I'm glad she is I won't have to repeat myself She's the last person I'd ever want you to marry She'll destroy you without fail Please answer me before I go insane I'd rather be dead I hate her, but not because she's Ueno's pupil... If I weren't her pupil... I'd never have met you She's evil and wicked I have strong reasons to suspect that she seduced your father Please wait until I'm home Come home immediately You didn't do anything to her, did you? You're not spending the night there, are you? Look at her carefully Do you know what she told me? She lives with Ueno... And she wants to marry you Don't you see? She's a sinister witch I don't know how she effects other people But she's a dangerous witch to us I'm not imagining things I know I had an eerie feeling when you left for Kyoto You did go there to see her Your father is very much upset, too If you're not coming home... We'll take a plane for Kyoto now I understand You don't understand anything Come right home. Now! Isn't it beautiful? Look at the sky over that mountain That mountain... It's like an upright spear waiting to kill us What are going to do? It would be nice if we could have her visit us here... With your father! You're insane Do you want to go home? Has she managed to make you homesick? Who knows? By the time you go home, your folks would be here Your father wouldn't like to come But he couldn't say, No, could he? Did you have an affair with him? An affair? And what is this going to be? Just another affair? Please answer me I want to know What am I to you? Just another loose, wicked girl? We're alone, but you don't care for me You want to know what I did to your father Do you want me to drown in the lake? Please don't. Not the right one I've hired a motorboat Let's go It'll soon be dark. Tomorrow, perhaps Tomorrow? Did you say, Tomorrow? You won't leave me until tomorrow? Are you sure? No, you are not But I want to go for a rife We won't go too far I just want to leave the shore and stay on the water with you Cut through the waves of fate and see what's beyond Who can be sure of tomorrow? Let's go now Many boats are still out on the lake A call from the Lake Biwa Hotel Lake Biwa Hotel? Keiko Sakami? Yes, she lives here Is anything wrong? A motorboat? Sunk? Is she? I'll be there Is she unconscious? Orjust asleep? She's under sedation Does that mean that she'll be all right? There's no serious injury But, when they found her, she was half dead She swallowed a lot of water She's half dead She kept calling a man's name Where is he? He's still missing All the boats are out searching The police boats, too I'm afraid he's dead by now All we can do is wait When will she wake up? I don't know Otoko Ueno? That's you, isn't it? You made Keiko kill my son. It was all your idea Wake up! She's under sedation Bust she must tell me where he is, I must save him Wake up! They're all looking for our son Keiko...
