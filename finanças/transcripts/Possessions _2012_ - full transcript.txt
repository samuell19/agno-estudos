(typewriter keys click) (gentle dreamy music) - [Jessica Voiceover] I got you something. (gentle dreamy music) - [Chloe Voiceover] Do you think he suspects? (gentle dreamy music) - [Chloe] Orlando? - [Orlando] Chloe? - I have no idea who you are. - I know. - How did you got my number? - A friend. - [Chloe] Does this friend have a name? - [Orlando] Yes. - Are you going to tell me? - [Orlando] No. Not right now. If it's okay? - [Chloe] If you're not gonna tell me about this friend, tell me something about yourself. - [Orlando] What do you want to know? - [Chloe Voiceover] How about something true. - When I was 14, I wrote a graphic novel. It was all about a young girl, who was struck by a comet and developed the power to transform into anything. But there was a catch. She could transform into anything, anyone-- - Except the person she was originally, before she got hit by the comet. - You read-- - "The Element." You wrote it? I heard about it, because people said I looked exactly like her. Is it true? - I have a poster of her hanging in my bedroom. When you walked in here tonight, I thought you were her. I think, it's time to tell you the name of the friend who told us to meet. Do you know Jean-Luc? - [Male Voice] Hello? Hello? Is anyone there? - Yes. - [Male Voice] Who are you? - I'm Orlando. Who are you? - [Male Voice] I do not know. Where am I? It is black. - I don't know. - [Male Voice] Where are you? - My apartment. Los Angeles. - [Male Voice] How are you talking to me? - I'm just talking. - [Male Voice] I don't understand. Can you see me? (slow whimsical music) - No. Do you see me? - [Male Voice] I told you, it's black, it's black. Where is my voice coming from? Where is my voice coming from? - In my head. (slow whimsical music) (glass clinks) - [Male Voice] What did you just drink? - Scotch. You can taste that? - [Male Voice] I hear swallowing. It is loud. Are you still there? - Yes. (jingle) - [Male Voice] I still hear it. (jingle) (slow whimsical music) (slow gentle music) - Are you still there? - [Male Voice] My name is Jean-Luc. - Jean-Luc. - [Jean-Luc] Yes. - Are you French? - [Jean-Luc] I guess, (speaks in foreign language). - Do you have a last name? - [Jean-Luc] I do not know. Why is this happening? (coughs) (gags) Are you puking? Are you sick? - Could you leave? - [Jean-Luc] How? I've no clue, how I got here. Do you? Do you know, why I'm here? - Sure. I'm crazy. - [Jean-Luc] You can't be crazy. Because I am real. (shower rushes) Right, Orlando? - Just stop talking. (loud buzz) - [Jean-Luc] Where are you? What are you doing now? - Shut up. - [Jean-Luc] Are you angry? - I'm talking to a voice in my head. You're a voice in my head. - [Jean-Luc] I'm not just a voice! - Hey, Orlando! Are you okay? (drum bangs) ♪ Good night, see you around ♪ - I'm talking about Jesus today. Come on around and talk with me! We have lots to talk about. Thank you (mumbles) Thank you for the encouragement. You come by, you see me in the basement of the rec center and we will continue this conversation with the Lord. We have lots to talk about. I'm talking to you. There is no salvation in the bottle, brother. There is no salvation in the bottle. I'm talking to you now. You hear me, I'm talking to you, I'm talking about Jesus. - [Jean-Luc] What are you drinking? - What do you want from me? I've answered all your goddamn questions. - [Jean-Luc] Why are you being such a prick? - Because I've got enough shit on my mind without some French asshole dissecting my life. - [Jean-Luc] Now you don't like me 'cause I'm French? You British douche bag. I could not care less about your problems. All I want to know is why the fuck I'm in your head. - Well, now who's being the prick? - [Jean-Luc] Still you, still you, Orlando! - Well, if you got a problem with it, then get the hell out-- - [Jean-Luc] Tell me how, asshole, and I'm gone. - Just shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up! - Hey, sunshine! Sorry, I'm late. - She's here, goodbye. - [Jean-Luc] Goodbye? Where the hell do you think you're going? - Well, that looked like an intense conversation. Who is that? - No one. - No one? You've been waiting long? - I just got here. - You just got here, huh? - [Orlando] Can you stop? - I haven't even gotten started. - [Jean-Luc] Is this how you handle your problems? Ignore them and drown them in alcohol? (glass thumps) (Orlando exhales) - You okay? - I'm fine. - [Jean-Luc] You are not fine. I'm in your head. - How was your trip? - It was good. You know, the usual. Nothing special. I got you something. (chuckles) I saw it and I thought of you. Remember? - Right. I sold the city of New York ad time last year. - [Jean-Luc] You sold the city a time? - Wow, sweetie. Your mind's really going. - [Jean-Luc] What do you do, douche bag? - Are you taking the ginkgo biloba I gave you? - Yes. Ginkgo biloba, it's one of those interesting words to say. Ginkgo biloba. - Hubub. - Uranus. - Sparkle - Knick-knack. - Lickety-lickety-split. Remind me again, why we're not still together. - I had a problem with that whole commitment thingamajig. - Right. (whimsical music) (door squeaks) Come on, I didn't think the service was as bad as the last time we-- Orlando, where's your stuff? - I gave it away. - You gave away, you gave away your plasma TV? (whimsical music) Well, you do still have your bed, right? I'm looking forward to the new position, actually. It's gonna be nice not having to travel so much. - [Jean-Luc] Why is your ex in your bedroom? - We agreed to be friends. And today is a special occasion. - [Jean-Luc] What's occasion? - Did you say something? - No. - Why do you insist on waiting until you've gotten the very, very last of the paste before buying a new one? - Why waste it? - How would you live without me? - With gingivitis. It's our ex-anniversary. - [Jean-Luc] What? - It was her idea. - [Jean-Luc] Obviously, you have no imagination. Oh, shit. You are not going-- - Say it, baby! Say it! Are you my master? Say it. Tell me, baby. - I am, I'm your master. - Say it louder! Louder! Say it louder! Louder! Louder! - I'm your master. - Yes! Yeah! Yes! Oh, yes! Say it. - I am your master. - Yes! - I am, I'm your master. - [Jean-Luc] Is she hot? (Jessica screams) At least tell me she's hot. - Louder! Say it louder! - She's beautiful. - [Jean-Luc] Beautiful, Christ. You are in love with her? - [Orlando] I guess. - [Jean-Luc] You guess? Do you tell her this? - No. - [Jean-Luc] Why? Why are you not with this beautiful girl who you guess you are in love with? - I don't know, Freud. - [Jean-Luc] Christ. You are a coward. Wait! Where are you? - On the couch. In the living room. - [Jean-Luc] The couch? Where is she? - Asleep in the bedroom. - [Jean-Luc] Why? - Because I have a problem sleeping, when people are lying next to me. - [Jean-Luc] You are kidding! And she puts up with this shit? - [Orlando] We broke up, remember? - [Jean-Luc] Oh, right! How long did she put up with this shit? - Two years. - [Jean-Luc] You have been banging her for the last two years without any commitment? Shit! I'm a little impressed. - It doesn't matter what you think, Jean-Luc. - [Jean-Luc] Why's that, coward? - 'Cause you're just a voice in my goddamn head. Have a good night. - [Jean-Luc] Good night! My master! (pants) - Happy ex-anniversary, baby. (breathes heavily) (soft dreamy music) - Morning. - [Jean-Luc] Morning. - [Jessica] Morning. Why have you stopped going to work? I talked to Keith. And what's going on with your place? You've got a box for a coffee table. - It's a nice box. I'm just simplifying my life. - [Jean-Luc] Simplifying? - I decided I don't need so much stuff. If I don't need so much stuff, I don't have to work so much. - [Jean-Luc] Pardon? - What about your weight? (light upbeat music) (door bangs) - Bye. (car engine buzzes) - [Jean-Luc] Is she gone? - Yes. - [Jean-Luc] Now that you've gotten sex, how about you focus on this situation? - Monkeys. (monkeys grunt) - [Jean-Luc] So what is with the monkeys? - I like monkeys. They're simple. They eat, sleep, fuck-- - [Jean-Luc] Throw shit at each other. I feel dizzy. Are you drinking? - Yes. - [Jean-Luc] Why? - I'm an alcoholic. A functioning alcoholic. - [Jean-Luc] Says who? - So, you remember anything more today? - [Jean-Luc] Things seem clearer. - Clearer? What do you mean? - [Jean-Luc] You are sitting, aren't you? Stand. Now sit and stand without telling me. You just sat, didn't you? You just stood. - You can feel that? - [Jean-Luc] Yes. (soft whimsical music) - What am I doing now? - [Jean-Luc] Are you doing something? - My arms are raised. - [Jean-Luc] I cannot feel it. I had to concentrate just to feel you stand. (soft whimsical music) - Did you feel that? - [Jean-Luc] What? - [Orlando] How do you know? - [Jean-Luc] I just feel motion. It's, it's like being in the ocean and feeling the waves. (soft whimsical music) (monkeys grunt) I can feel it. - You can feel me. (cars rumble) - [Jean-Luc] Where are we going? - My boss called this morning. I have to stop by work. - [Jean-Luc] I don't remember anyone calling. What time did he call? - Nine o'clock. - [Jean-Luc] Hmmm, guess I sleep. Christ! Think, I'm drunk! - [Orlando] I hardly drink. - [Jean-Luc] Well, I'm not a functioning alcoholic. I don't have the tolerance of a wino, like you. - You have a tolerance? (soft whimsical music) - [Jean-Luc] I guess. (soft elevator music) Where do you work? - Discount Shopping Network. - [Jean-Luc] What? What do you do? - I sell time to people who wanna sell their products on the television. - [Jean-Luc] Like a TV channel for shopping. - Yeah, something like that. - [Jean-Luc] Oh, that is so, so tacky. - I handle the VIP clients. - [Jean-Luc] So, you're successful-er? - Why do you care? - [Jean-Luc] Are you? Are you not? - A little. - [Jean-Luc] Why do you live in an apartment? - What do you mean? - [Jean-Luc] If you are successful, why don't you own a home? - 'Cause I don't believe in people being attached to material possessions. - [Jean-Luc] You sell crap to people, yet you don't believe in owning your own crap? - I don't sell crap. I sell time, so people can sell crap. - [Jean-Luc] And you consider that less evil? You yuppie scum. (uneasy music) - Quarterly reports are due next month. We need big numbers, Godzilla-like numbers. So what the fuck? You haven't been here for over two weeks. - I've been going through something. - Well, I'm going through a divorce and I'm losing my hair, but I show up. - [Jean-Luc] You do not like this guy, do you? - That's funny to you? - No. (uneasy music) You're getting a divorce. - What do you care? You are the only one with problems! (exhales) - I'm actually gonna need some more time off. - You actually have been taking a little time off. - [Jean-Luc] I dare you to call him a douche bag. - Fine, take it. Your buddy Keith hasn't been able to handle your team since you went MIA. Corporate's probably gonna have me axe one of you after next month's report. And since Keith couldn't sell snow tires to a fucking Eskimo, I'm betting on him. - You're really not a very nice person, are you? - [Jean-Luc] Douche bag, do it! - You should be thankful. I play a very important role in your life. - What's that? - I provide you with someone to direct all your repressed anger at. - Douche bag. - [Jean-Luc] I love it, (speaks in foreign language). (slow whimsical music) (door knob clicks) - Welcome back. - Keith. - [Jean-Luc] Keith? (slow whimsical music) - [Orlando] And he says his name is Jean-Luc. - [Keith] Just Jean-Luc? - [Orlando] He can't remember his last name. - Okay, you have the voice of a French guy in your head with just the first name. Tell me, that's what you just told me. - Yes. - You're telling me you're possessed? - I'm not possessed! - [Jean-Luc] Possessed? Who's possessed? - I'm not amused anymore, Orlando. Are you going screwy on me again? - What do you mean again? - Last year you were convinced that Baxter was the reincarnation of Mussolini. Before that you thought your neighbor girl was JonBenet Ramsey. - She could be. Your neighbors are Puerto Rican. - [Jean-Luc] Chloe Rai! - What is he, is he talking to you again? - Yes. - What he say? - [Jean-Luc] I think she's my girlfriend? - He says, he thinks he can remember his girlfriend's name. - [Jean-Luc] She is here, in the city! - Is it Jessica? - What, no! - [Jean-Luc] Chloe! (phone call tone) - [Operator] City and listing. - Chloe Rai, R-A-I. - [Jean-Luc] This, that is the name, I know it. - [Operator] There is a doctor's office under that name. - Doctor? - [Operator] Obstetrician. - Obstetrician? - Is she an obstetrician? - [Jean-Luc] What is an obstetrician? - It's like a gynecologist. - [Jean-Luc] You mean a pussy doctor? - [Operator] You want the number, sir? - How am I gonna spin this? - [Jean-Luc] You're the salesman, so sell. (phone rings) - Doctor Rai's office. - Hi, I'd like to make an appointment, please. - Okay, let me check the schedule. Looks like next Friday is the first opening. - Friday? - That's what the schedule says. And the schedule never lies. - [Jean-Luc] Friday? We cannot wait that long. - Quiet, I'll deal with this. I can't wait that long, I need to speak to her today. - How far along is the patient? - I'm not pregnant. - Okay. - What's your name? - Janice. - Janice, my name is Orlando Newberrie. I have something very important to discuss with Chloe. I'm a friend of a friend of hers. - What is this friend's name? - I can't tell you that. - This sounds kind of strange, Orlando. - I know it does, but it's true. And it's very important that I speak to her. - Today? - I know it makes no sense, yes. - (exhales) What do you have in mind? - Dinner, an early dinner. - Why an early dinner? - Because if you put me down on that schedule for an early dinner, you could change the rest of my life. - (chuckles) Wow! - And you could get off work early. Hello? Hello? Hello? - 5:30 at Le Petit on 4th in Santa Monica. You know the place? - I'll find it. - If you really wanna impress her, order her a fuzzy navel. - A fuzzy navel? - [Jean-Luc] Fuzzy navel? - Yep, tut-tut-aloo. (phone beeps) - [Jean-Luc] Seems you really are a good salesman. - She's real. - [Jean-Luc] You did not think she was real? Do you believe I am real? - If you weren't, I would have made you perfect. - [Jean-Luc] Being imperfect makes me real? - Or that, and the fact that the pussy doctor seems to be your girlfriend. (slow whimsical music) - He said it was okay, because it was a prescription. A prescription made it okay! See, the doctor made him do it. Not the devil, but maybe the devil is the doctor. (soft whimsical music) I saw that. I saw that. Who you hiding from? You can't hide from the eyes of the Lord. You put some clothes on, darling. (chews) (soft whimsical music) - [Jean-Luc] Was it Scotch? Are you drinking Scotch? - Yes. - [Jean-Luc] Eat. Eat something. (soft whimsical music) A maraschino cherry, no? A maraschino cherry? (soft whimsical music) (dreamy music) Peanuts! Yes, peanuts! Honey roasted, no? - I don't know, I... I can't taste. - [Jean-Luc] You cannot taste anything? I have your sense of taste. What does this mean? - [Chloe] Orlando? - Chloe. - [Jean-Luc] She is here? - I have no idea who you are. - I know. - How did you get my number? - A friend. - [Jean-Luc] Good, tell her. - Does this friend have a name? - [Orlando] Yes. - Are you going to tell me? (chuckles) - No. Not right now. If that's okay. Stay for one fuzzy navel. Give me a chance to explain. How is it? - Peachy? - I'm happy you came. - My secretary said you sounded clean. - What? - So, Orlando Newberrie, if you're not gonna tell me about this friend, tell me something about yourself. - What do you want to know? - How about something true? - When I was 14, I took a vow of silence for one year. - [Jean-Luc] At 14? - For religious reasons? - No, protest. My parents decided to put me in boarding school, so I decided not to talk for a year. - And what did you do during this silence? - I wrote a graphic novel. It was all about a young girl who was struck by a comet and developed the power to transform into anything. - [Jean-Luc] Any object? - Any living organism: human, dog, a bird, anything. But the trick was that she have to transform every 12 hours or she would remain as the thing that she transformed into. - [Jean-Luc] That is a super cool power. - It would seem like a cool power but there was a catch. - [Jean-Luc And Chloe] There always is. - She could transform into anything, anyone-- - Except the person she was originally before she got hit by the comet. - You read-- - "The Element." You wrote it? - [Jean-Luc] She read your comic? - I heard about it, because people said I looked exactly like her. Is it true? (soft dreamy music) - I have a poster of her hanging in my bedroom. When you walked in here tonight, I thought you were her. - [Jean-Luc] You are one bizarre drunk. (soft dreamy music) - I think it's time to tell you the name of the friend who told us to meet. Do you know Jean-Luc? - [Jean-Luc] She is happy, no? - Jean-Luc? - Was he your boyfriend? - Freshman year in college. But his real name is not Jean-Luc. - It's not? - No, his first name is John, J-O-H-N. His middle name is Luke, L-U-K-E. John Luke Mortenson. From Milwaukee. - From Milwaukee? - [Jean-Luc] Huh? - He had this whole French identity to get chicks. God, I was so in love with him, he really scarred my heart. - What did he do? - He got me pregnant, and I told him, and the next day he drained my bank account and disappeared. It's true. - He just disappeared? - [Jean-Luc] Disappeared? - Yeah. - [Jean-Luc] Who disappeared? - You don't know where? - I always hoped under the tires of a very large truck. (chuckles) - Did you keep the baby? - [Jean-Luc] Baby? - I planned to, but I lost it in the second trimester. - I'm sorry. And now you look after pregnant women? - Credit Jean-Luc for my choice of career. So, how do you know him? (slow dreamy music) - He's a voice in my head. (slow dreamy music) - A voice? - Yes. - And this voice in your head, Jean-Luc, told you? (slow dreamy music) What's my favorite color? - Your favorite color? - [Jean-Luc] Favorite color? - Yeah. - [Jean-Luc] Lavender. - Lavender. - Food? - You favorite food? - [Jean-Luc] Food? Pork rind. - Pork rinds? - Movie? - Favorite movie? - [Jean-Luc] Movie? "It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown." - "It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown." - [Jean-Luc] How did I do? - Are the answers correct? - [Jean-Luc] Are they? - No, every one of them is wrong. But they're all his favorites. - His favorite color is lavender? (chuckles) So, what do we do now? - I think I need a churro. - [Orlando] You believe me? - Yeah, I do. - Why? - I believed you without question. Do I really need to explain myself? - Yes. - My view of the universe is not limited to contemporary Western values. I follow Wabi-sabi. - What? - Wabi-sabi is the Japanese philosophy that nothing is permanent, nothing is perfect, nothing is complete. I don't judge anymore, Orlando. I don't try to figure things out. - Wabi-sabi, huh? - It's how I deal. - With what? - Global warming, leprechauns, childhood traumas. - Reality television. - Exactly. So what does, what does Jean-Luc think of all this, then? - I think he passed out. - Passed out? - If I drink enough, I can make him pass out. - I don't understand, how? - I'm an alcoholic. - [Chloe] So he constantly talks when he's awake? - Constantly. I kinda feel bad for him. It's all he has. (soft dreamy music) - I think it's time for me to see "The Element." (soft dreamy music) "The Element. "She can change into anything, except who she was before." (swooshing) (soft dreamy music) Scotch out of the wine glass? The reason for this is? - You never see depressed people drinking wine. They are always happy, light. - [Jean-Luc] (exhales) Was I out long? - He's awake? - [Jean-Luc] It is weird, I just drift off without warning. - I was so enjoying our private time. - [Jean-Luc] Are you there, Orlando? - Yes. - [Jean-Luc] How long was I out? - Not long. - [Jean-Luc] What did you learn? What did she tell you? Did she believe I am real? How did you end the night? (soft dreamy music) - Tell him. (soft dreamy music) - You're French. - [Jean-Luc] Okay, yes, what else? - You're from Paris. Royal family and very good looking. - [Jean-Luc] Rich, royal and French? That is what I was thinking. (soft dreamy music) - Tell him he had a small penis. - But you had a small penis. (chuckles) - [Jean-Luc] No! She told you that? How small? - How small? - Cocktail wiener. - Cocktail wiener. - [Jean-Luc] No, no, no, that cannot be. Does she at least know what happened to me? - You just disappeared one day. - [Jean-Luc] Disappeared? Disappeared? - Yep. - [Jean-Luc] That doesn't make sense, does it? - None. - [Jean-Luc] How is Chloe? She loved me, right? - I don't know. Did she love him? - [Jean-Luc] That is what I'm asking. Did she? Does she love me? (soft dreamy music) - Make him disappear. (soft dreamy music) - [Jean-Luc] Christ, are you drinking again? (gentle music) Finally, you're awake. I think, I passed out. So what did you think of her? Are you going to see her again? - I think so. Shell's too small, isn't it? (breathes heavily) - [Jean-Luc] I can smell your vomit. I have your sense of smell. (toilet flushes) - [Jean-Luc] Chloe has dark hair, no? And a fantastic smile? - Yeah. - Is she still preaching that new wave of spiritual bullshit? - It's not all bullshit. - [Jean-Luc] Christ, she has some issues. - So, why do you like her then? - [Jean-Luc] She always forgive me. No matter what I do. She always take me back. (knocks on the door) Who is it? - Keith. What did you do with all your stuff? - I gave it away. - You're feeling, you still hearing that French guy in your head? - No. He went back to never-neverland. - [Jean-Luc] Ah, you're talking about me. - Yeah. I was freaking out that day. I just spent the night with Jessica. My mind was a mess. I'm gonna go put something on. (phone rings) - Hello. - [Jessica] Keith, hi, this is Jessica. - Hi. - [Jessica] I'm calling about Orlando. Have you seen him? I haven't been able to get a hold of him all week. - [Keith] Do you know who's Jean-Luc? - [Jessica] No. - Nothing. - [Jessica] Look, do you think we can get together? I'm really worried about him. - Let me call you back and we'll schedule something. Remember this? - [Orlando] Told you, it would make us rich. - Yes, you did. - You are not here to shower me with compliments. What's going on? Really, tell me. - [Jean-Luc] What is his problem? - Fab Ab and Uncle Sam's Grill are threatening to pull their products. - That's not much of a tragedy. You need to relax. It's not the end of the world if we lose them. Nothing is permanent. - [Jean-Luc] Nothing is permanent? Oh my God, Orlando! Are you quoting Chloe? - Baxter's called a meeting for our team, Thursday at 4:00. We really need you there. (bolt bangs) - [Jean-Luc] Christ, Orlando! Do you think it's the best idea to drink and shoot arrows? (bolt bangs) (slow drums music) (soft relaxing music) (office chair rattles) - I think you're in the wrong place, mister. (taps) - I'm Orlando Newberrie. - Oh, the guy on the phone yesterday. - [Jean-Luc] Did you just eat licorice? - Janice. For you. - Thank you. - You got her a fuzzy navel, didn't ya? - [Jean-Luc] Ah, I have licorice! (phone beeps) - The guy you went out with yesterday is here with a compound bow. - [Jean-Luc] Stop eating this, douche bag! - Second door to your right. - [Jean-Luc] Douche bag, stop eating it! (quirky music) Did you just kiss Chloe? - What? - He can taste you. - [Jean-Luc] Ah, vanilla. She smells like vanilla. - He says that he likes that you smell like vanilla. - He can smell me too? - [Jean-Luc] Wait, why did you kiss Chloe? What's going on? - So, do you think he suspects? - [Jean-Luc] What are you not telling me? - I should go. I have things to do. - [Jean-Luc] What things, Orlando? What is more important than this? (phone rings) - It's Saturday tomorrow. Should I come over? (phone rings) Should I? - [Orlando] Sure, okay. (phone rings) - Yeah? - [Janice] Doctor, the kid is about to fall out. - I'm on my way. (door bangs) (child cries) - What can I do for you, partner? - I'm looking for a hermit crab shell. - You mean a crabitat? Crabitat? Crabitat? Is your crab male or female? That's something you wanna think about. If you don't know, that's fine. Personality traits: is your crab outgoing, maybe sorta standoffish? They're kinda crabby? (chuckles) Great, follow me! (soft relaxing music) (keys clink) (quirky music) - Hello, Senor Newberrie. - [Orlando] (speaks in foreign language), JonBenet. (door lock clicks) (door taps) (soft dreamy music) No rush. (glass clinks) (cardboard box rips) Did you know that over the last five years the ad time I've sold has generated 280 million dollars. - [Jean-Luc] I did not know that. - [Orlando] And you know what time that equals to? - [Jean-Luc] Enlighten me. - 64 hours and 27 minutes. - [Jean-Luc] I do not know why you hate your life so much. You get to drink whenever, you get to fuck whenever, you get to work whenever. - [Orlando] So, you're saying, you like my life? - [Jean-Luc] I guess, I am. Douche bag. - I have something to confess. I believe you are taking over my body. Jean-Luc? Are you there? Are you there? Alone at last. (birds chirp) (cars buzz) (church bell rings) (knocks on the door rapidly) - [Jean-Luc] (speaks in foreign language) (knocks on the door rapidly) (knocks on the door rapidly) - [Orlando] What are you doing? - [Jean-Luc] Is is Chloe? - You haven't returned my calls for five days. I'm coming in. What is going on? - [Jean-Luc] What is going on? - That's it, I'm canceling my trip. - Jessica. - No, I'm canceling it and I'm taking you to a doctor. - Jessica, please. Stop. - What is going on with you? What is this? What are you wearing? What's wrong with you? - It's better you don't know. - [Jean-Luc] Why can't you just tell her? (exhales) - Jessica, wait. - You need to see someone. A doctor, a minister, a monk, I don't care. You need to see someone. (door knob clicks) (upbeat music) - Let me talk to you about lust, brother. It's poison, it'll eat you life. You can always reach me in the basement of the rec center, and I'll be there for you. (upbeat gospel music) ♪ Lord set me free ♪ ♪ Lord set me free ♪ ♪ Lord set me free ♪ ♪ Lord set me free ♪ - What do you think? - Jesus. Jesus! I think you're pretty desperate. You want me to tell you something to make you understand, help you find the truth in your situation. Truth only comes with faith. - You mean religion? - I'm not talking about religion. I'm talking about faith in something, a belief, a person, yourself. I'm talking about you. A life without faith is empty, and alcohol, and drugs, and little voices in your head won't fill that up. - What if it is real? What if it's really happening? - Well, the only thing that's real is that you gonna have a chance to say goodbye to your loved ones. You gonna have a chance to die in peace. (chuckles) What's so funny? - What you said, it's just better than I expected. - Maybe you shouldn't expect so little out of others. (scissors click) (elevator door rings) - [Jean-Luc] Oh, someone has bad body odor. - It might be me. - [Jean-Luc] My god, I need a drink. Did I just say that? - Yes. - [Jean-Luc] Wait, why do I need a drink? - 'Cause I haven't drank since this morning. - [Jean-Luc] Why? - I needed to be clear to get through this. - [Jean-Luc] Are things clear? - No. I need a drink. - [Jean-Luc] Stop shaking your leg, it is making me nauseous. - Nauseous? How can you feel nauseous? You don't have a stomach. (elevator door rings) - [Jean-Luc] It is not for me. Stop it. - Even if you can achieve these numbers, without Uncle Sam's Grill and Fab Ab, you are 10% lower than last year. (door knob clinks) - Ladies, gentlemen. (taps) - What's this? - Uncle Sam's is branching into deep fryers. This is one of a 180,000 units, which we will sell for 89.99. Now, this is, I'm not exactly sure what this is, but Fab Ab has 400,000 of them, which they want sold by October for around 29.99 each. If we sell all of them, which I have no doubt we will, that puts us over 32 million with our usual percentage, means we're up 35% over sales figures for last year's quarter. - [Jean-Luc] Is the asshole shitting his pants? (elevator door rings) (soft gentle music) - [Keith] All right, how did you do it? - [Orlando] I met with the big man himself. - [Keith] Wait, you met Uncle Sam? - Yeah. And I told him that 64% of all Americans over the age of 20 years are overweight. And I told him, we understand this and that we have a marketing strategy in place to advertise his new deep fryers to that exact 64%. Then, I went to Fab Ab and told them the exact same thing. - I don't know what we'd do without you. - Selling's not that hard. (Keith grunts) No, really. It's all about easing people's pain. - Pain? - They want their products to be on our show, otherwise they wouldn't meet us. They think that this will bring them closer to happiness, or at least what they think is happiness. So, if you approach every sale with a knowledge that you are easing somebody's pain, you're never going to fail. (coughs) - You okay? (coughs) Orlando! Orlando! Hey! Orlando, Orlando! (soft dreamy music) (phone rings) (slow peaceful music) - [Jean-Luc] When were you going to tell me you are dying? - How do you know? - [Jean-Luc] I heard the doctor explaining it to Keith. (slow peaceful music) (faint tone) I hear it. You cannot hear, can you? (slow peaceful music) How long do you have? - I was supposed to be dead last week. - [Jean-Luc] Last week? - The day you entered into my head. (slow peaceful music) - You bastard, why didn't you tell anyone? - [Jean-Luc] He just called you a bastard. - I didn't want you to worry. I almost had you sold. - Why would you have to sell me? - [Jean-Luc] Why do you have to sell him? (slow peaceful music) (cars buzz) (knocks on the door) - [Jean-Luc] Someone is knocking. (door knob clicks) - I come bearing gifts. (dreamy whimsical music) Sound really calms me. (dreamy whimsical music) I bought one for John, but-- - He can hear you. He can hear you, taste you, smell you. - Hello, John. - [Jean-Luc] It's great to hear her voice. - He says it's great to hear your voice. - [Jean-Luc] She's wearing my favorite perfume. - You're wearing his favorite perfume? (dreamy whimsical music) (knocks on the door) - Someone knocking. - [Jean-Luc] Someone is knocking again. (door squeaks) - I cut my trip short. I spent a lot of time thinking about you and me. - This is not what you think. She's Jean-Luc's girlfriend. - Ex-girlfriend. - Who's Jean-Luc? - [Jean-Luc] She is asking about me. - Here, I got this for you. And the number of a doctor you can talk to. - [Jean-Luc] Say something! She does not understand. - Jessica. Jessica! - Yeah? - She is here to help. - You don't get it? You never got it. I wanted to be that person. (door slaps) - What did she say? - [Jean-Luc] She wanted to be that person. (soft whimsical music) - I think you should go. - You shouldn't be sad. You can't control people's wills. - [Orlando] What did she say? - [Jean-Luc] She is starting in on the new age bubble. - We're all just energy, we're all-- (glass shatters) (screams) - [Jean-Luc] Take it easy! - Fuck you, Jean-Luc. - [Jean-Luc] Fuck you too! - [Orlando] Just go. Please. - Do you want me to go, John? I wanna be with you. - [Jean-Luc] Who? - Who? - You. You. - [Jean-Luc] She wants, she wants us. (smooches) (soft peaceful music) - [Orlando] I need to level with you. - [Jean-Luc] Okay. - [Orlando] You're name is not Jean-Luc. - [Jean-Luc] It's not? - [Orlando] No. And you're not from Paris. - [Jean-Luc] I am not? - [Orlando] You're from-- - [Jean-Luc] Wisconsin. - [Orlando] How long have you known? - [Jean-Luc] Since the night you lied to me about my dick size and slept with Chloe. - [Orlando] You knew? - [Jean-Luc] John Mortenson. - [Orlando] If it makes you feel better, I think she's still in love with you. - [Jean-Luc] I don't know. Last night I got the feeling she was there for you more than me. - [Orlando] You ready? - [Jean-Luc] Yes. Let me see you. (soft peaceful music) I can see. I can see you. (slow dramatic music) - You were right. - [Jean-Luc] About what? - It really is dark. - What's with the stuff? - [Orlando] It's my little fuck you. - [Jean-Luc] To who? - To myself. - [Jean-Luc] Huh? - I used to think that people were judged by the possessions they leave behind. - [Jean-Luc] Your life amounts to this crappy insignificant shit? - I used to think so. Maybe it's not that simple. (soft peaceful music) I need you to do something for me. - [Jean-Luc] Sure, anything. (soft peaceful music) (birds chirp) (cups clink) - Oh, hey, Orlando. (soft peaceful music) - [Jean-Luc] Careful, guy's coming up on the left. I think I see her. She really is beautiful. Just keep going straight. She's sitting at a table on the left. She's staring at you. She looks worried. - I know you're on your lunch break. I just wanted to tell you some things. - [Jean-Luc] Good, she seems interested. Look up at her. - I don't believe there is one single universal definition for love. I believe that each person, each relationship should be judged by its own standards. I know it's a small consolation but in my life, our relationship is the most significant. I took the most risk. - Why are you telling me this now? - [Jean-Luc] She's asking why you're telling her this now. - I'm dying. I'm dying of cancer. (Jessica gasps) I'm gonna die soon. - [Jean-Luc] She's crying. Fuck, this is horrible. - It's okay. I'm okay with it now. - [Jean-Luc] She put her hand on the table. I think you should grab it. To the left. - When you look back on our time together, know that I loved you and I know it may not have been enough but remember that I loved you the best I could. (slow dramatic music) (soft bring music) - [Jean-Luc] I still not get any of this. It doesn't seem like I deserve a second chance. - You're getting a second chance in the cancer-riddled body of an alcoholic. - [Jean-Luc] Yeah, but I get to do it with Chloe. - Nothing is permanent, nothing is perfect, nothing is complete. Thanks, Jean-Luc. - [Jean-Luc] For what? - For being a prick. (soft peaceful music) (soft pensive music) - Hello. - [Orlando Voiceover] I'm here. - It happened. Christ, you really are an alcoholic. Wine? - [Orlando Voiceover] I thought it might be easier for you. (gulps) (coughs) First drink is the hardest. Try again. (gulps) What are you going to do? Back to Wisconsin? - No. I think I'll go to Paris. Live out the rest of my days as Jean-Luc. (chuckles) (coughs) Orlando. Oh, shit, there's blood. Orlando, are you there? No, don't leave me alone. - [Chloe] Orlando? - [John] No, it's me, John. Help me. No. Please. (door knob clicks) Orlando? - [Orlando Voiceover] Nothing is permanent. Nothing is perfect. Nothing is complete.
