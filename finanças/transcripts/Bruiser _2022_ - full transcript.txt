Darious. Darious. I'm really gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you too. Darious. Is that your mom? Come on, we gotta get home. Goodbye. Bye. I haven't seen you in three months and you're still making me wait. I'm sorry. Oh, I love your hair. Thanks, Mom. Missed you. Missed you too, Mom. Why do you always play this song? I thought you liked it. So am I allowed to ask? No. Please. Fine. You get one question. What's her name? Mia. Mia... and what... - No, I said one question. Your dad and I, we love you, and we're really proud of you. What'd you do that for? It's annoying. We just passed the park. Oh, so now you paying attention to me. Can I? Careful. I am. You miss this, huh? Beautifully done. Haven't missed a beat. - Hey, man. What's up? - Hey. - How was traffic? - Not bad. I didn't know you were working from home. I had to see the champ. God damn, you're tall. Wait, let me see you guys together. - Monica, please. - Stand back to back. Malcom, he's almost as tall as you. Yeah, I know, and he's still growing. God damn. Listen, your mom and I are really happy that your grades are up. - Thanks. - Yeah, of course. Yeah, no problem. So Darious, tell us, how are your friends? Oh, they're good. Great, they gonna come visit anytime soon? I don't know about that. Hmm. Well, at least you got friends here, right? That's true. Hey, come on here, come here. Glad you're back, man. It's gonna be fun. Hey, Mia. Hi. What you doing? I'm at a restaurant with my family. Where are you? I'm at home. Cool. Um, so what else are you doing? Mm, not much. My mom just told me we're going to Greece. Greece. Cool. Uh, I have to go. Food's here. Bye. Bye. Okay, so what does that even mean? That the scholarship is dissolving? Like, could you explain that to me, please? What does that mean? - Dad? - Yeah. I don't want you to apologize. I need you to make it work, all right? So I look forward to you giving me a call when the situation is resolved, okay? Bye-bye. - Dad? - Yes. Um, what am I supposed to do? There's no one here. My friends are all in the city. What the hell am I supposed to do all break? We don't live there, uh, Darious, we live here. So the money that we spend to send you to St. Andrew is different from the money your friends spend. So the time away from school is gonna be here where you have perfectly good friends. Anything else? I need a new bike. Why? What's wrong with the old one? It's rusted. It's too small for me and the tires aren't even inflated. Well, we got a bike pump in the garage. Dad, can't I just get a new bike so I don't have to use this shitty old one? Why would we get a new bike if you can still ride your old one? I'll just ask Uncle Ernest for one. Don't. Don't ask your Uncle Ernest for everything. Can you please look up at me while I'm talking to you? Don't be asking your Uncle Ernest for everything. So you're not gonna buy me a bike. No. Asshole. What's Darious stomping around for? What is his deal? He's been acting like one of them rich white kids from his school. - Come on. - Aww, what happened? Your boy just called me an asshole when I'm over here breaking my back for him while he is in his room - playing "Call of Duty." - Oh, poor baby. You look so down. What's going on? Nothing. All right, sexy. Don't get too stressed out up here by yourself. Show me that ass. Let me see that ass. Yeah. Stop. Come on. All right, you better go make up with your son. I have a student coming over, so it's just you two for dinner. Yep, like we talked about. Okay. Okay. Go ahead. Hold the bow like this. Yep. Sit up. Now try again. You said you got a canoe, right? - Yes, sir. - Go right on top. Make it perfect for off-road. I've always wanted a Jeep. I just have to make sure Sheila's down. Ah, why you gotta go ask Sheila for? Hey, come on, man. Don't get me in trouble. I know, I know, I know. - Well, tell her I say hi. - I will. Well, this is, uh, the Sheila-mobile - if she don't like the Jeep. - Oh, okay. How's the business? I mean, it's been... It's tough recently, but we steady, so we'll be fine. We'll be fine. - I know you will. - Thank you. - Welcome. I know I never say this enough, but I'm really proud of how far you've come, man. Uh, well, I appreciate that, man. No doubt. No doubt. So are you gonna have that Jeep in your driveway tonight or what? Man, as long as I get the law enforcement discount. Hey, listen, I'll do you one better and give you the friends and family discount. Have you out of here in an hour. - How about that? - Sounds good. Boom. There you go. Hey, June. What the hell? You're so tall! - Your hair's so... - Hey, guys. - What's up, bitch? - Shut up. Damn, D with the drip. What's up with your bike, bro? - What the fuck is that? - Don't be a dick. Hey, you've got that baby bike. What ya doing? Cutting this fucking wood. Wanna try it?

Darious, where are you going? Darious. Hey, little man. What are you doing over here? Pass me that sweater right there. Right there. Did you get into a fight or something? Yeah. Was he older than you? Yeah. Did you get yours? No. Well, you did something. That's a start. Yeah. Is that your boat? That's my house, man. What you doing out here, little man? At the Jon House? What... the what house? The Jon House. The old... old man who killed himself? Right. Why you know all that? My dad used to work there. What's your daddy name, little man? Why do you wanna know that? 'Cause believe or not, I used to work for the good Mr. Jon, too, before he passed. You're Malcolm Garter little boy? Yeah. You guys worked together? Yeah. Something like that. What's your name, man? Darious. Nice to meet you, Darious. Nice to meet you too... Porter. I'll see you around, little man, all right? June called me. She said you were in a fight. - I'm fine. Are you gonna tell me what... I know you're fine, but what happened? He was just being a dick. You shouldn't hang with him if he picks on you. Look, I'm fine. And he doesn't pick on me. We just got mad at each other. Even if he makes you mad or if he's a dick, you shouldn't lose control in situations like that. June told me you went off into the woods. Why is she telling you all this shit about me? Because you don't tell me anything. You know you can trust me, right? I do trust you. Good. 'Cause I trust you too. Where we going? Come on, let's switch. Okay, seat belts. Okay. Okay, good. This is drive. This is reverse. Don't worry about the other ones. Okay, put it in drive. Keep your foot on the brake. So easy. Okay, give it a little gas. Okay, you can give a little more gas. There you go. Stay on your side of the road. Nice. Just relax, baby. Look at you. Oh, watch the road. - Yeah. - Hey, buddy. How you doing? Good. Good. Your mom spoke to Mike's mom today and said that, um, you thought it was all a joke and then you shoved him. What happened? He started pushing me around, and I couldn't get him to stop. You can't lose your temper like that. You gotta study hard. Take your lumps and go far, right? I'm not just gonna let someone push me around and do nothing, Dad. You know the story? So when I was younger, I, uh... - Yes, Dad. I know the story. When I was younger, I used to get in fights all the time. And then, you know, when I got into fights and got beaten up, my dad, he would hit me. And then I got older, and soon enough, I hit him back. It's not good, Darious. It's not a good way to be. You gotta take your lumps. Study far. Go hard. Got it. All right. Okay. Love you. Love you too. Hey, Mon. Hey, Ernest. We'll move down. Hey, Darious. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Okay. So what do I do in my situation? I mean, I don't have the savings to send Darious to your school, and I don't know if I can afford a loan. So what do people do in, you know, my situation? Fucking asshole! What's up, man? - Hey, I'm sorry. - Hold up, hold up. Sorry. I'm sorry. You like that? It's my homeboy. Yeah. It's all right. "It's a'ight." What types you like to listen to, man? I don't know, Lil Baby. Lil Baby? That's my homeboy, man. I met him out in Vegas. - You did? - Yeah, yeah. I used to work security out there. I still got my man on Venmo. So what can I do you for, little man? I, uh, just wanted to learn how to protect myself. You asked your daddy? He's not gonna help me. Yeah. You know, me and your dad used to be boys back in the day. I only say that to say, little man, Malcom can be wrong about shit sometimes. Yeah, yeah. PORTER: Yeah. - I know. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right, man. You right-handed? Yeah, yeah. It's right-handed. This is just for self-defense, right? Get your thumbs out. All right. Get your thumbs out. Yeah. You gonna throw left, left, right. Left, left, right. I need you to hit it right here. Smack right here. Left, left. Left, left, right. You gotta... you gotta gimme a little bit more than that. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Give me a little bit more than that, a'ight? Left, left, right. Left, left, right. Do I need hit you again? - I mean... - Okay, okay. Gonna need a little bit more than that, all right? Left, left, right. Yep. Shit. That's the fuck I'm talking about. Ah, shit. My ears still ringing, man. That's what's up. The first thing you gotta do when you are in a fight is stay calm. If you're calm and he's crying and sweating and all that, you win. What does that tattoo say? What? Which one? It's like fluids. Precious Bodily Fluids. You like movies, little man? Yeah. You ever see one called "Dr. Strangelove?" Ah, man. All right. So a general of an American army base goes completely AWOL, right? Has his whole battalion, turn on the rest of the army. He's played... You gotta sit down, man. You're looking weird standing up there. Pop a squat, grab a seat, man. It's, like, my favorite shit, man. It's, like, the funniest shit I ever seen. Okay, so what is it about? The end of the world, basically. You know, mutually assured destruction. It may not come in a form of stealing bodily fluids or nothing like that, but you bet your ass sooner than you think, they gonna control everybody you know. You know, everybody all tapped in their phones all the time and stuff. It's like a form of cancer, man. Yeah, what's up? What are you talking about? - What? What are you talking about? You're weird. - I'm weird? - Yes. Mad sus. So you're super... - You're weird! - Okay. All right. Talking about tracking the phones and the end of the world, man. You're crazy. My dude. You all right? Yeah. Nah. Good man. I got something for you. You know who this is? Yeah. Yeah. It's the Kung Fu dude, right? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Strong young god Bruce Lee. Wow, he's ripped. Yeah. Only 5'8", a buck-forty. You ain't always gotta be the biggest. You just gotta know what you're doing, you know? Thank you. Mm-hmm. Hello? Porter called the house today. Like, Porter Jackson? He's in town, and he wants to meet us. And you said no, right? Monica. I think we should. Why is that? I'm secure with us, our life. I'm okay with hearing him. I think it'll be good for me to find forgiveness in my heart for him. It'd be good for you to find it too. You don't owe that man anything. He left us. He can't just come back after all this time. He don't deserve that. This grievance and anger is what I'm talking about. He's not coming back into our lives. Let's just listen to him, and hopefully, he'll listen to us and we move on. This isn't about him. This is about us. Sorry I'm late. All right. You wanna... you gonna grab... All right. Where should I... um... Well, I just wanna start by saying, I apologize for, you know, all the stuff I put us through as kids. You know, that was all my fault. I own up to that, you know. But, um, you know we're here now. You know, I'm a a grown man now, you know, and this is all about Darious. So it's real good to see you, Monica. You, too, bruh. Why'd you come back? I mean, why come back now? Like, you know, man, six years in the air force, little time out in Vegas. Just trying to find my way. Everything has just led me back here, you know? Led me back home to you guys and Darious, my family. Can I get you anything, sir? I'll take a coffee, man. Coffee. It's good to see you, Hector. Do I know you? - It is Porter, man, you know. Porter. I used to come in here with Malcolm. Porter. Of course, I didn't recognize you with your tattoos, your hair. You got big. How good to see you. - Good to see you, man. - Enjoy. Surprised the old man is still working here. Well, he's a close friend of ours. I teach his granddaughter violin, actually. I see you're still playing. Does Darious play? I tried with him. He doesn't have the patience. So, uh, you know, what does he, uh, what does he know about me? Why don't we keep the conversation on getting reacquainted for now? All right, you say that you're here for Darious. What does that mean? Can you explain that? Meaning that I wanna be in his life, you know? I mean, if you guys let me, of course. Oh, Porter, we appreciate your apology. That means a lot. But you walked out on us, and you can't come back after 12 years and have it go back to normal. Yeah, I understand that. You know, I know it'll take time to get warm, but I'm willing to do whatever it takes. You know, everything is on your terms completely. All right, then. You know, uh... I was thinking about this the other day. Remember your nickname, Nini? Yeah. Yeah, I remember that shit we used to get into. Remember that Charger you used to have, man? I know you remember. - Mm-hmm. I sold it. Remember that time you was in the front seat with him and damn near broke your foot 'cause you stepped on the damn floor 'cause it was all rusty? Ugh. I know you remember that. I know you remember it, too, why you trying to hold that laugh, man? That rusty piece of shit. - I loved that car. - Uh-huh. It was hard for me to part with it, but I loved it. I told him there was no way Darious was riding around in it. Yeah, and I got rid of it, thank you very much. Actually, uh, since we're being all open and honest and everything, I want to, uh... I met Darious. You know, it was... It was a complete accident. He just... he just came by where I stay. Excuse me? Yeah, it was a couple of days ago out by Jon's old place and, like, he got beat up by a kid or something, all blooded up. Did you tell him who you were? When I introduced myself, it didn't seem like he knew who I was. I told him my name and he... I don't know why the fuck you think he'd know your name. You're irrelevant, and I guess that's for Nini to decide, right? It was my decision to make. He knows I didn't have him with Malcolm, and I didn't tell him about you, and I'm sorry about that. You don't gotta apologize to him. He wasn't here. Did you tell him who you were? No, I promise. And I don't know how the fuck you think he'd know who you are. Don't know why the fuck you let my kid get his ass beat... It ain't got nothing to do with you in the first place. And the fact that you think it does... - Of course, it does. Bruh, that's my son. What you mean, man? - He's your kid. - That's my son. - You believe that? Is that what you think? Okay, stop. Please stop it. I'm sorry. I just wanna meet Darious. You know, I just wanna meet my son. Well, unfortunately... We would need to discuss it together between the two of us. Look, I get the hostility, man. I really do. But I'm reformed, bro. I ain't that little boy you used to know. I can promise you that. I understand, but you need to trust us that we listened to you and we need to go and talk about it together. Okay? Yeah, I appreciate that. Okay. Okay. I don't think this is a good idea. I really don't think we should let him in. There's so much pain in the world. Let's just be good to Porter, and the Lord will be good to us. So he's my real father. He is not your real dad. Malcolm raised you. Malcolm's your father. Porter is the man I had you with when I was young. So why didn't you stay with him? We were too young and he wasn't ready to raise you. Why? Why wasn't he ready? Because... Because some people, they run from their problems. - I was a problem? - No, honey, of course not. No, no, no, of course not. No. That's just how Porter saw you, saw the situ... Do you even want to see him? Yeah, he's cool. Okay. Okay. Well, in that case, we all need to be there as a family because your dad and I, we're still getting reacquainted with him. And I don't think we're ready for all that yet. And I know your mother and I still gotta talk about if we want to let you around Porter. I thought we talked about it. And I think that we are not ready for that yet, Monica. What is there left to talk about? We don't know yet, but when we decide, we will let you know. Okay? Is that okay with you? Sure. Okay. Family hug. Come on. I love you. Check this out. Boom. - Oh. - Pure muscle. Yep. Okay. Yeah, okay. - Yeah... - You look frail. - Wha... June? You ready to start? Coming. What happened? Darious, leave her alone. He thinks he's so funny. Dad! Mom! Dad! Dad! Help! Help! Darious? Darious! Hey, I got you. I got you, I got you. - What happened? - Nothing. Darious, are you okay? Everything is all right. You can go back downstairs and finish your lesson. Are you sure? It's fine. Okay. What the fuck were you thinking, boy? Listen, if you want to learn how to do stuff like that, all you gotta do is ask, okay? I can teach you. I can show you. Shut up. - What'd you just... - Just shut up. Don't you fucking talk to me like that. Hey, Nini. Nah, he all right. Nah, no, I heard he and Malcolm got in a little fight. So he came over to see me. Yeah. Right, you know what we should do? We should take little man to the fair. We could all meet by that ugly-ass statue we used to meet at. What you say? Nah, this could be a good thing. Come on, are you joking? Let me do something nice for y'all. Oh, I bet. Come on, son. All right, you wanna go play some games, man? I thought we were waiting on my parents. Oh, you right. You right. Check with it. You the boss. Hey, that's good, man. You a very obedient kid. That's cool. That's real cool, I'm just saying. Not really. All right. Just more obedient than me. That's all, you know. I'm not obedient. All right. Hey man, where you going? To play some games. Ah, that boy got big balls. Ooh. First try. Let's see what you got. I can do it, though. I can do it. Look. Closed. Right now. Right now. Eyes closed. Oh-ho-ho! Eyes closed! - You didn't do that. - I did that. Oh, my God. - All right, come here. Come here. You ever come here before? Yeah. Yeah. I used to be up here all summer with Malcolm, man. Find little tickets on the floor and hop on the rides with it. - Really? - Best shit ever. Yeah, really. Oh, that's my dad. - Speak of the devil. - Hello? - All right, lemme... Lemme talk to him. Lemme talk to him. Lemme talk to him. Hey, man. It's Porter, where y'all at? Relax, bro. Bro, relax, y'all was late, man. We're just... All right. You bet. Meet y'all at the front. We'll meet y'all in, like, two minutes. All right. Pop up on the Ferris wheel for a minute? What about my parents? - They made us wait, man. They can wait a little bit. Come on, man. It'll just be a minute. Just gonna be a minute. What? Hey. Oh, watch this, watch this. Hey! What grade you in, man? Eighth. Well, seventh going into eighth. Eighth grade, smart. - Oh, yeah. - Yeah, you know. It's my dad. Just call them back. They'll find us. Um, yeah. Yeah, I go to a boarding school. Boarding school. Your boy fancy. You like it there? Yeah, it's cool. I like my friends. You got a girlfriend? Yeah... Why you say it like that? Well, I don't think she really likes me anymore. Why not? Well, we used to talk a lot, but now it's like we rarely ever do. She's hanging out with other friends. So listen, just make sure you know your own worth. Make sure you know that you're special and if she don't see that, fuck her. You feel me? - Yeah. Yeah. Talked to Malcolm about her? No, no, he wouldn't be much help anyway. How was he? What you mean? Like, when you guys were younger, what was he like? Malcom? He was like my brother, man. Like my little brother. He was childish. We grew up together, you know, fucked around, broke shit. He used to overreact when we were kids all the time too. Boy used to have a temper on him. Really? You know, that's probably why he reacts the way he does when you're just trying to defend yourself. That reminds him of how he used to be. Probably just don't want all that rubbing off you. What'd he do? He didn't tell you about none of that? How he used to be? How he used to just send cats to the hospital for looking at him all wrong? And his pops, man. His pops used to push him around a bit. And then one time, Malcolm just snapped, damn near killed him. Almost broke his neck. He almost killed him? Like I said, man, that's... that's not... I wanna know about you. That's what we here for. I'm here to learn about you. What you wanna be when you get older, what you want to do? I don't know. You don't know. No, I wish I was grown up now so I could do whatever the fuck I want. What would you do? What would you do? I'd probably get a tattoo. - Oh, yeah. Like what? What would you get? Mm, probably something like this one. Hmm, a blind snake. It's blind? I got it when I left the air force. Blind snakes live underground. So why did you get it? - Well, you know... You know what a drone is, yeah? Yeah, my friend from school has one. Okay. So I used to be a drone pilot when I was in the air force, right? They wanted me to fly blind, fly without my eyes, without my soul. Just fly, pull a trigger, hit a target. A blind snake comes from below, I came from the top, and we do about the same thing. All those people who had me doing that, bruh, the motherfuckers is evil, man, they're inhumane. So the tat is to remind me of what I'm not. It's to remind me that I'm not evil. If I'ma hurt somebody, I'ma have a reason. I'ma look 'em in their fucking face, you dig? Yeah. Yeah. But that's just my life philosophy. Everybody got one, and you will too one day. Look, Darious, you... You're clearly a very bright young boy. I know by now you've realized that I'm your dad. Now, I don't know what you would want our relationship to be. I think you're cool. Cool. You know, I like spending time with you. I just... I want you to know me. I want you to know who I am. You know, obviously I want to know everything I can about you. - I get it. So I'm cool, huh? You're okay. Oh, just okay. Okay, you're pretty okay. Oh, shit. Darious. What the hell were you thinking? - All right. - What is wrong with you? You know we were waiting over there. Right. My bad. Why aren't you picking up our phone calls? I didn't see them. We were having fun, playing games and stuff. Yeah, we're just chilling. That's not okay. Why would you think that's okay? - Come on. Let's go. Let's go. - Let's go, Darious. - Man, stand up, come on. - Dad, come on. You ain't gotta grab him. Come on, stand up. Come on. Shut up. Let's go. - Everybody, relax. We can go kick it. We can go play some games, ain't no thing. Listen, I'm telling you this right now. This is never fucking happening again, okay? What you mean? Hey, Darious, you... - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Do not talk to him. Don't talk to him. - I can't talk to my boy? Don't do that. Let's go to the car. - Bro, you ain't his dad, bro. - Come on, Malcom. Why don't you shut the fuck up and stay the fuck out of my business, okay? - Go back... just go to the car. - You need to relax, bro. Hey, relax, bro, all right? You're pretending, stop. - You're not his dad. - Hey. Say something again. Say it again. Say some more shit. Say, say, say it again. Speak about... Yeah? Could you come downstairs, please? Why? Family meeting. I've always felt like your father, and in my heart, I've always been your father. So when I saw him tonight laughing and smiling with you, it made me fucking sick to my stomach, knowing who he is and what's in his head. Is this your way of apologizing? Monica, I don't know if I'm apologizing right now. Maybe it's merited, maybe it's not. He was giving me advice. He was helping me. When you were born, he looked at you, and he hated you. He didn't want to hold you, Darious. I did. He was gone for weeks, drunk. Your mother, Monica, didn't even wanna leave you with him because she thought he'd accidentally kill you or something. But I was there for you, not him. But that doesn't mean you're the only one who can change. But I can see what he was capable of. I saw that. I saw what he was capable of. When we were younger, he almost beat a kid to death in the bathroom at a bar. And I came in too late to stop him. Just 'cause the kid disrespected him or something. There was a mass of flesh on the floor. That kid couldn't see... - Malcom, stop. - Stop. - He couldn't speak. He could only moan because he kept hitting him. Horrible. He gave that kid brain damage. That's what Porter's capable of. And that is what comes to my mind when you guys bring up his name, and that is why I did what did today. And, Darious, I can't have you around that. Darious, go to bed right now. Because when I look at him, I can tell you for certain... Go. That Porter has not changed, Darious. Monica, he has not changed. Uh, Nini. I, uh, you know, I want to... I wanna apologize about yesterday. You know, I didn't mean for things to blow up the way they did. You know, it's just we was waiting, and the little man wanted to play some games. You can't come in and start doing what you should have been doing the past 13 years. Right. It's just, you know, it's crazy seeing him all growed up like that, you know? You know, actually, I got this thing I wanna ask you. I had this trip that I kind of wanted... No, not right now. Maybe when he is older, but this isn't working. You should go back to Vegas. - What you mean? That's my little... That's my little boy. We could work something out. I mean, I'd hate to... You're gonna stay away. What the fuck you mean? I'm... That's it. Stay away. Okay. Okay. Slow way down. We're good. We're good. Where's all this confidence coming from? Put both hands on the wheel. But you drive with one hand. I've been driving for 15 years. You've been driving for zero. Okay, now you drifting. - Chill. Okay. Stay within the lines. - I am. - Okay. Okay. All right. Stop here for a second. I need you to promise me something. You're gonna tell me not to hang out with Porter. I know he's new and you feel like he understands you. He's just nice to me. He doesn't know you. It's not hard to be nice, honey. That doesn't mean anything. It means something to me. I know you're pissed at your dad. I'm pissed at him too. And I'm having words with him as soon as we get home. But I promise you with total certainty between him and Porter, he's the one that cares. He's always gonna be there for you. So I don't want you to talk to him. I'm being really serious. I need to know you understand. Fine. You can drive now. You're quiet. So? So it's weird when you're quiet. I'm thinking. So think out loud. Are you depressed? What are you thinking about? Nothing. I'm just thinking. Stop. Sorry about the Porter guy. My mom told me about it. Stop. Do you wanna hug? No. Are you sure? Yes. I mean, it's weird that this is happening and you said you didn't want a hug. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Oh, shit! Darious, there's no way this is your dad. June, you have to see this. - Turn it off. - Come look at this. Mike, turn it off. That's it. It's not fucking funny. - Cut it out. - It's hilarious to me. Fucking God, it's good. Turn it off. Turn it off. Stay the fuck out of my business. Yo, Darious, you see this? Dude, your dad's a one-punch legend. Oh, my God. Say something again. Say it again. Oh, my God. Oh, oh, oh, oh! Oh, shit! Darious! Chill, chill, chill, chill! Stop! Darious, stop! Motherfucker! What the hell, get off! Darious? Darious. Darious. Darious. Open this door now. I'm on the phone with Mike's mom. She said you really hurt him. What did you do? Answer me. Coming in. - Get the fuck out. Darious! You have to talk to her. You have to handle this yourself. You know better than this, Darious. Shut the fuck up! I'm so sorry. I appreciate that, Catherine. But it's no excuse for his behavior. Hey! Relax, bro. You have to stop pretending. You're not his... Hey. Say something again. Say some more shit. Say, say, say it again. Why don't you shut the fuck up? Stay the fuck out of my business. - Hello. - Hey, little man. How you doing? Porter? I want to talk to you. I heard you got in a little trouble today. How'd you know about that? You think I don't keep tabs on my little boy? Come by the window. Ah, good to see you, man. I miss you. How you feeling? You all right? Yeah. Just, uh, just a little shitty. Mike might have to get stitches. Ah, come on, man. Look at me. Everything gonna be all right. It ain't no thing, all right? Malcolm, my dad, he told us something about you, and it was weird. Oh, yeah. What'd he say? You ask me anything, I'd tell you. He said that when you were younger, you got into a fight with some guy at a bar or something and he had brain damage from it. There are some things that are pretty shitty about my past. That's one of them. But I've tried to make myself better since, and I hope you can appreciate that about me. He ain't say nothing else about that? That's all he said about that? What do you mean? He was beating up on that little boy too. Actually, he was going so hard, I had to pull him off of him. Really? Yeah, man. I wouldn't lie to you. You're my little boy. Look, I've come to terms with my truth. Clearly, Malcolm hasn't. I've never seen him that angry before. If he ever scares you, if you ever feel unsafe in there, you come to me, all right? Okay. Talk soon, little man. Bye. Bye, man. There's a man named Porter Jackson who's been hassling my son and also trespassing on our property. I know he is living illegally in one of them houseboats on the old Galo property. Hassling your son? Well, I mean... I'm not sure, but I've asked him to stay away from Darious, and I keep seeing him in the neighborhood. Monica and Darious would feel a lot safer if he was gone. Is there a problem now? Nice boat. I appreciate that. Mia? Hi, Darious. - Are you Porter Jackson? - I am. How you doing? I hate to be a prick. It's the worst part of my day, but it comes with the terrain. What's the problem, officer? - You're trespassing. - Okay. We ran you through our system. You got priors in Vegas, possession and distribution of cocaine. We don't exactly send out the welcome wagon for that type of person. - Man, I'm sorry. Y'all just decided to run me on a whim? But you really don't have to call that much. We can just talk back at school. Okay. Cool. This is the safest car in the lot. I mean, you can pass it online, look around, you know what I mean? Sir, your nose is bleeding. Hmm? Your nose is bleeding. We're gonna come back tomorrow. You better be gone. I hope that's clear enough. I'm sorry, who the fuck told y'all to come here? Malcolm Garter, Garter Motors. Hi, Malcolm. This is Samantha Walters. Hi, I'm with a customer right now. May I call you back? Well, I'm from the Office of Financial Aid at St. Andrews. I have to deeply apologize for all the stress we put you through, but we finally have some good news. All right. What's the news? One of our donors reached out. Mm-hmm. And she just loved Darious's story. And she's willing to provide Darious's scholarship for this next year with us. And then he should qualify for the high school program here as well. I knew it. I knew if I kept pushing y'all, y'all gonna make it work. This is really gonna make his day. This is really gonna make his day. Well, we'll send over all the paperwork. - Thank you. - Of course. All right. Take care. You too. Sorry I'm late. Hi. - It's all right. - Happy birthday. - Aw, Malcom. These are beautiful. We have beers in the fridge if you want. Thank you. Where's Darious? I think he's outside. Okay. You ready? You sure? All right. Ho, ho, ho, ho, here it is. Wow. I knew you wanted one. Yeah, yeah. Thank you. Yeah, you like it? I love it. I got the wrong one, huh? No, no. I said I love it. I know it doesn't seem like it all the time, but I'm really trying here, Darious. I want to give you everything that I am. I really do. I know. And I feel like I'm just always getting it wrong. Oh, look, I said I liked the bike. Look, I could have taught you to drive, man. Why didn't you ask me? Just didn't want to get yelled at. I can't do it perfect. - You gotta go. Come on. - I gotta see my son. You called the cops on me, my nigga? No, no, you have to go. No, I'm calling the police. - I gotta get this off. All I... - Darious, go upstairs. Porter, please, leave. - I have been nothing but open and honest with both of y'all about my intentions. You look really stupid, man. You're embarrassing yourself. But you ass sitting here lying about old shit. What are you talking about? That shit from 15 years ago. This nigga helped me beat that little boy ass. - Look, man. - Go wait outside. That's my little boy. How is he better than me? That's my boy. He didn't run away. Right. You're right. Look, I just wanna love my son. I just want to love my son. - Porter... - That's it. I just wanna love my son. - Please, just go. - Get out of my house. - Go. I just wanna love my son. The police are on their way. Get the fuck out of my house. You got a disease in your heart, bro. It's killing your family. Was Porter telling the truth? It's a total blatant lie, and it's fucked up that you're even asking me that. You know, that's exactly what he wants. To tear us apart. - Stop, stop, please stop. - Just tell the truth. I am telling the truth. Okay, fine. I think you're lying. You know I saved your ass today, right? The scholarship at your fancy-ass school fell through days ago. And I was the one that got on the phone. I put it together so you can keep going. Is Porter gonna do something like that for you? At least he doesn't lie to me. Really? He lied about everything. You're just too stupid to realize, okay? Mm-hmm. Sit down. Don't be a pussy 'cause the conversation's too hard. Sit down. Sit down. - Malcom. Malcom! - Darious, sit down! Sit down, Darious. Get off! Stop. Stop. Darious, stop. Stop. Okay, baby. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Calm down. Breathe, baby. Breathe, breathe. Breathe. Monica. Darious. Whoo-hoo! Yeah! There we go. There you go, I'd be right back. What the fuck you laughing at, little boy? You. The way you're looking at that, you look like an old-ass man. - Get the fuck outta here. You look like an old-ass man. Okay, my bad. I guess I struck a nerve. Appreciate you. All right, well, what can I get you boys? Whatever you want, man. Um, may I get the steak, please? - How do you want that? - Medium. - Uh, two of those. One medium, one rare. I'll take a beer too. Will do. Hector will get right on that. I like your shirt. Thanks. You're welcome. Thanks. Is she cute? All right, man. So what's up, man? Nah, bruh, don't gimme that. You know I'm risking going to jail for this. My neck is way on the line. I really wanna know what's going on, Darious. My dad... I mean, Malcolm... Is always lying to us. And my mom, she keeps falling for it and it just pisses me off so much. Like, he won't be real for one second. He's always pretending to be this person I know he's not. It's like, what else is he lying about, you know? - Yeah, nah, yeah. I know how that feels. I grew up with him. Hey, Darious, what are you doing here? Hey, we were just getting dinner. This is Porter. - Hi. - Hi. Um, so what are you doing here? It's late. Oh, I'm just helping out, and my grandpa's gonna give me a ride home. Cool. Cool. Yeah, is everything okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Okay. Yeah. Cool. That's your friend? Yeah, it's June. I like her. Hello. - Where are you going? - I'm getting Darious. What are you talking about? Malcolm. Malcom! - He grabbed your arm. Did he hit you? No. No, he just got really mad and grabbed me. He's calling. - Fuck that. Don't answer that. Fuck that. Hey. Hey, look at me. What if he gets mad and hits you next time? You need a break from all this, little man. I guess. Hey, you know, I was, uh, I was thinking, man, what if we, uh, you know, we went somewhere? What if we did something for a week or so? Did what? Pop out to Miami or something. I got some people out there we could stay with, hit the beach, grab a concert or something. That sound fun or what? Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely. - Yeah? - Yeah. Uh, but what about my parents? What about 'em? You need a break from all that anyway. Uh, what about my clothes? We can get all-new everything. I'll get you everything new when we get there. Don't worry about it. Pick a place. I can't just pick a random place. Well, you can. As long as we together, we good. Where you wanna go? Pick. We... we shouldn't. We should get the food, right? Hey, Hector, man. It's been, like, an hour. Where the steaks at? Man, they're coming. They're coming. What's going on, man? How is that when everybody out here? Hey, Darious, you wanna come sit over here with me and June for a little? Why would he wanna do that? Are we gonna have a problem? Just gonna talk a little bit. Yeah, you should go with them. Hey, hey, you don't have to touch him. - Come with me, Darious. - You should go. - Hey, you can talk to me, man. Don't touch him. - Come on. - No, yeah, it'll be fine. He's fine. You... hey, don't touch him. Are we gonna have a problem with you? - Relax, bro. Relax, bro. We good. Hey, come on. Don't... hey, don't touch my kid. You can go, and he's gonna stay. - You ready? I think we should go. - Please go. - What did I say? Don't fucking touch him. Get the fuck. Don't touch my fucking kid! Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go, let's go, let's go. What is wrong with you? - We're okay. We're okay. We're okay. Shit. I shouldn't have did that shit. I just hate when folks stick their nose in stuff that don't belong to them. Where we going? No, don't answer that. You don't need to talk to them. Don't answer that. Anywhere. Uh, Miami. We can go to Miami. Like I said, I'm... What the fuck? I'll get you another one. Don't worry about it. - Stop the car. Just pull over for a second. Stop the car. I need my phone. Dad, please. Please, pull over. Let's just sit for a second and think about this, all right? Listen... Darious. Hey, Darious. Come on, man. I'm sorry. Darious. Hey, it's too dark, man. We're not gonna find it. Hey, I'll get you a... Darious. Hey, I've been calling you. It's okay, it's okay. He wanted to see me. He wanted my help. Dad! Stop!
