THE NIKKATSU CORPORATION Subu, where did you find that guy? He's a back washer in a bathhouse. Simple-minded... but he's got a big one. - What about the woman? - A prostitute who works for us. Just one? Yes. Two would be too expensive. It's not easy. Someone's coming! Did you go to Kobe? Umm. Did you sell any films? Nothing from last week's work, but it'll pay off. Sure. It's the end of the year. We'll go and sell once a week. No, Subu. Like this. I know, I know. Master, is this all right? Kabo, do you have the glasses? What time is it now? 10:00. These are too big and loose. Wrap some tape around them. Hurry up. I'm tired. Don't be silly. You haven't even started yet. Boss, it's okay here. Kabo, don't flash that so much. It's too risky. Subu, that's good. All right? Shoot. Drs. Phyllis and Eberland Kronhausen Present: THE PORNOGRAPHERS Â©1966 THE NIKKATSU CORPORATION Lighting by IWAKI YASUO, OHBA MICHIAKI Art Direction by TAKADA ICHIRO, SHIOZAWA HIROMI Directed by IMAMURA SHOHEI Sound Recording by BENIYA SHINICHI Music by KUSUNOKI TOSHIRO Edited by TANJI MUTSUO Original Story by NOSAKA AKIYUKI Screenplay by IMAMURA SHOHEI, NUMATA KOJI Produced by IMAMURA SHOHEI, TOMODAJIRO Starring OZAWA SHOICHI SAKAMOTO SUMIKO NAKAMURA GANJIRO MIYAKO CHOCHO The woman's facial expressions are good. What kind of fish is that, and what's it doing there? Very strange. Is that a bridge back there? Looks like a place I know. Stop kidding around. Think of your age. You're crazy. Sure I am. But you taught me, right? I don't know. Who's better: your dead husband or me? Silly! I can't tell you that. All right, I'll make you tell me. Don't. Keiko will come down. - It's so cold! - What's all this? It's very cold. Act your age, Koichi. Go away. Keep me warm, Ma. I'm cold. You must've kicked off the covers. I guess so. You have to be careful about your health. You're shivering. Stop tickling me. Ma, breakfast. All right. I'll be right down. Koichi, let go. Keiko's mad at me. Come on, let go. Now stop that, Koichi! Get up and put on a sweater. Which one? The black turtleneck looks good on you. - Are you going to school? - No. Don't say such things. You've got a nice room upstairs. An apartment's a waste of money. But my friend's paying half, and you could rent out my room. That's not it. Mr. Ogata won't like it. He won't care. He's not my father. He's supported us for seven years. Dad supported us for 13 years before that. What are you talking about? Mr. Ogata is going to send you to college. That's nice, but remember: When he was renting the room upstairs, he had no job and you supported him. Yes, I did for a while. But ever since I got sick- Anyway, I can't study here. It's too hard to concentrate. Ask Mr. Ogata for some money. Medical instruments aren't selling. It's a bad time. But you'll ask him, huh, Ma? Tell him yourself. Ma, always Ma. What? You spoil your son, Ma. Poor Mr. Ogata. So honest and- Honest? He's been arrested. Only for election irregularities. Stop it, you two. Honey, bring me some tea. All right. I'm coming. You know, Koichi was saying... he wants to get an apartment. I said no... but what do you think? Your mother went to Heaven and became a goddess of the Buddha. I saw her in my dreams last night. She said you must respect your new mother. That will please Buddha's goddess. Don't be cruel anymore. Mr. Ogata. A letter from your father. Thanks. He probably wants money. Thanks. A corrupt priest and his geisha. Always bothering me. Good morning. Nice weather today, huh? Yes, very. Just as I thought. You're so kind. I owe you so much rent and still... Thank you so very much. That's all right, Mr. Ogata. You help with the children and the shop. I owe you a lot. I'm happy to be of help. No, don't! You got hurt. Are you okay? No, please don't! No, please don't. It was my husband's last request. I promised to remain a widow. Then he could rest in peace. But... I'm really crazy about you. No, don't. It's true. Do you love me? Yes, but I can't. I'm still in mourning. Who cares? I promised my husband... but I can't help myself. Why did you get an abortion? Why? I wanted your baby, but the others are so grown-up and- That's ridiculous! Things like this happen every day. I wanted that baby badly. Well, the truth is, the carp jumped. The carp? Yes. That carp is... the reincarnation of my husband. The fish was born on the day he died. He used to always go carp fishing. That's silly. But it's true. Whenever something bad happens, the carp jumps. Honey, don't leave me. I won't leave you. If you do, I'll kill myself. I'll never leave you. I'll stay with you till the day I die. Well, when you put it that way... Let's face it: She's no youngster. Your old lady isn't so young, but I guess she's got her good points. I couldn't say, but I guess we were made for each other. I thought of leaving her once, but it's worked out so well that I've stayed on. It's written in the stars, I guess. Superstitious, eh? But my wife says it's true. Who needs a wife? I got rid of mine years ago. It was she that left you. Banteki, where is that humming noise coming from? It can't be helped. The ceiling's full of wires. Lots of static. Can't stop the humming noise. Subu, I hate to ask you for money. You been gambling again? No, my daughter's having a baby. How much? About 30,000 yen. How about making a film a day? Why not three films a day? Others do it. No, two's the limit. The talent gets tired and can't do their best. That's true, too. She sounds good, except when she's talking. What? She hopes the bean curd man doesn't forget to come. She's thinking of dinner now. Great. What realism. So true to life. How much? 5,000 yen. It's an original tape. But it was taped from another room. And you got it for nothing. You just taped your neighbors. But it was hard setting it up. And I was cold, sitting up all night. All right. If you get any more, call me. You scared me. Were you in there? I was touching up some pictures. You don't have to do it in there. It's delicate work. It's easier to concentrate in there. How did they come out? Pretty good. But the facial angles on the Sumo guy and the actress aren't right. That's okay. Hurry and print them. You're getting fat again. I am not. - Have you had your heart checked? - Not yet. Honey, don't. - Watch out now. - Careful. You're awfully quick with those hands! How about getting someone from the barbers' union to help you? It's not easy with this shop. I wish Keiko would get licensed soon. She told me she won't become a lady barber. You're spoiling her. But a high school education is necessary nowadays. Still worrying about that traffic accident? I just mean it's a father's duty to send his daughter to high school. You're kinder than a real father. What's that for? The police. I'm still on probation. I don't want any trouble while I'm getting the money together to build a house. Don't be so anxious about making money. You worry me. But even if I'm arrested, I'll be released right away. Man's pleasures are eating and making love. If he can't do that... Even big executives have no reason to live without that. They work hard all their lives to get into the best schools and land a good job. By 50 they're old men. They can't stand up straight. My job is to give them a purpose in life. In other words, it's social welfare. These are all brand-new. They're great. I read them myself. They've got a lot of detail. These are just like the other ones. Oh, no. The action is the same, but the time and people are different. Read it and see. This new story costs 1,500 yen. But I'll give you a discount coupon for next time. Subu, got any more of that medicine? How was it? Great! My old lady cried with pleasure for a change. Congratulations. But I don't have any on me. - You don't have any more? I'll be getting some from Hong Kong soon. I see. Just don't forget. This is for you from my old lady. Thank you. Thank you very much. This time I insist on a virgin. Just once in my life, I want to be the first for some girl. I wasn't even the first for my wife. It's true. Forty years of being second. Secondhand girls all my life. I can't take it. I understand, but virgins are hard to come by these days. That's why I'm asking you. Please help me. Otherwise I'll pounce on some schoolgirl soon to get what I want. I understand how you feel. How about Mitsuko? She likes playing a virgin. No, all that crying over lost virginity is no good. Minoko? She's not so sentimental. Bad reputation and too fussy. Besides, her exaggerated screaming gives her away. What's wrong with Chiyoko? She's here, but she couldn't be a virgin right now. Hello there. Oh, Chiyoko. Whose baby? Mine. - Did you change its diaper? - Yeah. I feel good. Twenty days since I took a bath. I see. Well, I guess that rules her out. Give me a month and I'll make her a virgin again. You mean it? Yes. And she's good at playing a virgin. She wore a corset so the baby would be born small. Her figure's good and no milk. Can you get a doctor's certificate? Don't worry. Chiyoko. Take your clothes off. Subu, come in and have a look. How much then? With your commission, 120,000 yen. That's high. She's had a baby. That's not expensive for a virgin. This position is the best. Look, now there are two men. Is that a real American? He's a real one, all right. You can see by the size. That's an American. Don't drink too much. You must concentrate on your work. They're having a company party. Ignore them if they bother you. Just put on a good show. I got them with the 8mm movie. It'll be over soon. Okay, let's get to the show. It's wild. We'll buy it. We can use it on the tax office men. How much? - Well, it would be... - Pass me that napkin. - Get it yourself next time. 60,000 yen per film. I'll take them both. Thank you very much. I hate to ask, but could you lend me 30,000 yen? It's our boss's party. Make the receipt out for 150,000. I'll do that. You two hurry up now. Is your husband working? Yes, he sells medical instruments. You're all done, young lady. You were a good girl. You look so pretty now. Keiko, would you go see Mr. Takaichi at the union? Ask Koichi to go for a change. He's not home. He's back now. Where are you going? I have a date. You haven't done your homework. Did you know Koichi has a girlfriend? You should be studying. There'll be a lot of parents there today, so raise your hand up high, okay? I heard you come into Mother's room last night. I hate you. You're mean to her. Keiko. Wait a minute. I suppose it's natural to have a girlfriend or two. But that examination's coming up. I don't have any girlfriend. - Is that the truth? - Yes, it's the truth. All right. But what happened to last month's tuition? Your school sent a notice about it. Must be a mistake. I paid them. Don't lie. I've got it right here. What's the matter? A stomachache. The classroom's so cold. Why didn't you tell me you lent the money to a friend? It doesn't matter anymore. I'll never get into the university. I'm thinking of becoming a barber. Don't be silly. You could excel at any profession. You're smart, like your dead father. I remember how he used to help me with my homework. You amazed him. He always said you were a bright boy and must go to college. If he had lived, I could've gone to a better high school. Now no decent college will accept me. Don't give up. I'll pay the bills, and you study. If the atmosphere were right, I could. You have a nice quiet room. What more could you want? I don't mean physical surroundings. I'm referring to conditions of a higher nature. Gently, Ma. It hurts. You're referring to Mr. Ogata? Yeah. Everything, including him. You're putting me in a tough spot. I'm not criticizing you. You've got a right to be happy as a woman. You understand me, don't you? Haru, where did I put that? Put what? The invitation to the 8th Battalion party. - That hurts. - Sorry. You mailed that yourself yesterday. Oh, did I? Is Haru home? Your god is here. This house rests on neglected tombs. Those souls have no place to go now. There's something holding them back. It's no good. They won't go away. Just as I thought. You're the cause of this, madam. This soul worries about you so much that it can't go to heaven to rest. What should I do now? Welcome back. Hello. - Are you the head of this household? - Yes, I am. Well, thank you. You seem to be very busy. No, not so busy. I'm a member of the Crow Gang. - Crow Gang? - Yes. I'm Nishioka. In fact, I'm one of the chiefs. I've been waiting to ask you to get us in on your racket. How did you know where I live? We don't feed our guys for nothing. I had them check on you. But there's no racket. Yes, there is. This, for instance. That's- This will do for tonight. You'll give us more later. But that's- You've done a good job disguising the faces. It was worth the wait. Very well. How much for 20? I give up. 40,000 yen. That's retail. We'll pay 5,000. - That's ridiculous. Including the haircut and the bag... it'll do. That's terrible. 10,000 won't even cover printing costs. Thanks very much. So long. Bastard! What's wrong? I don't feel good. Can't you sleep? How do you feel now? Don't worry. Just relax. I hear the carp jumping. There is no carp. I threw it into the river. You got rid of it? You shouldn't have. I'm scared. It was just a fish. Don't worry. Go to sleep. Honey. What? I want you to hold me. What? Hold me. I want to forget. I'll do it if you want, but you're sick. Please. Don't get up. All right. Honey. Don't get excited. Remember your heart. Not like that. Hold me real tight. Like this? All right. Your brother might get jealous that I bought you a new dress, so put the uniform back on later. I'll buy something for him too. But Ogata was the smartest in our battalion. That's not true. You're smart, all right. You've got the youngest wife. Stupid! This is my daughter. Poor excuse for a smart man. Only Ogata made lance corporal. I couldn't compete with your feminine ways. Really? I'm not that good. But the commander sure fell for you. He sure did. You've got to change into your old dress. It's okay. I'm going right up. The collar is showing. Push it in. Is it all right now? Shall we go? Good night. Good night. Ma, care for some tea? You're home? Yes, thank you. Hello there. Things going well, eh? The second one's out of high school. Her mother wants to buy a new dress for the girl. That's no concern of mine. She's your mother's younger sister. She was very nice to you before you went into the army. That painted hag? I've really suffered because of your lechery. I want to ask you one thing. What's that? Was there anything between you and Teruyo when you were in school? You're out of your mind. If nothing happened, then it's okay. What did you expect, stupid? Don't get excited. Anyway, I can't give you any money. For 10 years you've been nagging me for money. You shouldn't talk like that. I've got my own troubles. You got what you asked for. Why live with a widow who's older than you? And this shabby shop- Stop it. She can hear you. You may be a salesman, but you're still an Ogata. Marry a decent girl and settle down. Stop talking like that. You're really stubborn. Where's that picture, the one of Teruyo's niece? Picture? The big one I sent you last year. Mr. Ogata. What is it? Your father's talking about- Forget what that lecher says. This came for you. It slipped my mind. Honey. - What's wrong, darling? It's so dark. Haru, are you all right? Come here. Haru's sick! Let's go. What kind of animals do they have at Tennoji Zoo? Hurry. There's not much time. Wait. I have to check the meter. Got to see how much electricity you used. You're really cheap. After 5:00 o'clock, it's 500 yen per hour. I know. Now get out, quick. I'm taking a chance, aiding in the production of erotic films. I know, I know. Stop complaining and get out! Master, everything's ready. Keiko's uniform fits her well. That guy looks exactly like the one who ordered this film. Show me the order. "Schoolgirl attacked while studying. Man is doctor type, gray hair, glasses." We need glasses. The doctor who ordered it can't do it himself, so he wants it on film. Shall we start? Let's get started. You're studying here at the desk. Take this book and sit here. Now, sit down and hold this. She's strange. Is she deaf? No, just a little slow. Retarded, I mean. What? That's no good. She's still a woman, isn't she? Let's get started. But- Oh, well. Come here. Sit down. Take this. Just like you're reading. A doctor comes in over there. He surprises you. Walk in over there. Right there. See? You look over there. Turn your head, then stand up and act surprised. Stand up. What can we do? This is impossible. She's the right age. Can't you make her move? There's only one thing she can do. All right. We'll use a simple story. Your right hand is in the shot. Okay. Old man? You come in here... and push her down. This time you're only a burglar. When I tell you to, rip her clothes off and hit her. Okay? All right, now. What's that? That's something robbers don't do. It's your daddy. Look. I'm sorry. Daddy was mean. Daddy? It's really frightful. What is? Human nature. Who would ever expect a father and daughter to do that? But what else could he do? Holding his daughter is like giving milk to a baby. He said he doesn't consider her to be a woman. It was strictly fatherly affection. But still, father and daughter... Every father wonders about the man, the one who'll get his daughter first. You don't have to tell me that. Every father feels the same way when his daughter reaches that age. When mine got married, I almost lost my mind. Who said you can't sleep with your daughter? How about thousands of years ago? They did it with all their relatives. That was a long time ago. Not now. That's it! A wild sex party! What are you saying? Idiot. That's what animals do, not human beings. We all want to leave the human race. We want to be free. Only society's taboos prevent us. You're misinterpreting democracy. Try it once. I'll organize it. You're crazy! Cut that out. When did that lecherous monk come? Early this morning. He left this. Taking advantage of your condition. 15,000 yen. What's this? A scarf for Koichi. Don't do things like this. I have lots of time. Did he mention the picture? That idiot. I want you to ignore him. But that's the way a father feels. He only talks like a father. I think I understand him. He made my mother miserable. Honey, you know, I've been thinking. About what? The shop and the land. Let's put them in your name. They're worth about 2 1/2 million yen. I suppose you're right. Honey, let me do it. Why so suddenly? I'd just feel better. Please? Now don't get excited. It's not good for you. This fits me well. You scared me. Didn't you go out? What's wrong? Did you take the medicine for your fever? Why didn't you take it? I saw Ma. She looks much better. Sit up and drink this. What's all that? I used this at the company's party. I borrowed this too, without telling you. I'll put it back, and I'll treat you to dinner sometime. Where did you get this? Somebody lend it to you? A friend? What does this friend's family do? The father's a policeman. Kids shouldn't read this junk. This is for stupid adults. The man who wrote this is a bum, some lecher whose wife left him. You know him? No, but I'm sure he's a bum. That's why you have to study hard. Read something good for you, like biographies and science books. Read about Dr. Schweitzer, or books about democracy or something like that. You're acting strangely, Mr. Ogata. You're acting so excited, like- I'll let you kiss me- but just a kiss. Mr. Ogata, are you home? Anyway, don't read stuff like this. Yoshimoto Ogata? We're from police headquarters. Police? What's the charge? Selling pornographic materials. I'm sorry. How's Ma? Is she okay? Would you please take a gift to my lawyer, Mr. Yokoyama? I'm sorry I didn't tell you. I just wanted money to take care of you. Tell people it's for election irregularities. Take care of Ma for me. Tell her not to worry. I'll be home soon. I know his business is immoral, but it's not like he's a murderer or thief. He isn't hurting anybody. But what if my friends find out? Don't let them. Still, it's a filthy business. But he means well. It's really embarrassing. Why did you buy more books? I told you a while ago. I paid the hospital bill so I don't have any cash. Get more money from him. He makes plenty from his dirty business. Society has to suffer so he can send me to college. He only did it for us. It must be cold in there. Yes, Mr. Ogata caught a cold. He's paying for his crimes. Koichi, don't be so cruel. How was jail? Not bad, but very cold. Kabo's late. It's me. The police are at the laboratory. Then we can't get any prints? No, it's too risky. Damn! Sixteen movies down the drain. 300,000 yen. What'll we do? That's big money. We lost 300,000 yen. It's silly to get upset now. Let's set up our own laboratory. How much would that cost? About 800,000 yen. A black and white printer costs about 400,000. That's a lot of money. But... a printer's a good investment. And we'd get better prints. That's right. Honey, I can't find the bank book. I thought you might... You got it? Okay, I'll come get it tomorrow. I'm busy today. Can I bring you anything? Okay. Bye. I brought Keiko home. I'm home. Will you give us money for the cab? How much? It cost us 3,000 yen. You think it's right to take my daughter out and get her drunk? She's the one who made us drink! That's right. Kept mumbling about resenting her father or something. That's right. Are you all students? Yes. I can't figure you guys out. Just like bums off the street. She could press charges. We didn't do a thing. Let's have the money. I'm not giving you any money! Okay, okay. Let's go. He's not her real father, so he just doesn't care about her. Doesn't even trust his own daughter. Must be a real lecher himself. I'll beat your brains in, you bastards! Keiko, get up. You'll catch cold. You know you owe me 2,800 yen. What? They told me to collect from you. Why, those... My change. Thanks. Keiko, wake up. Wake up. You should study hard. Think of Ma in the hospital. You're filthy. What? Filthy. Don't you know how I worry? Idiot! So what if I'm filthy? What if it is erotic? I may not be smart, but I'm no fool. I'm a man. - Where have you been? - Playing ball. What were you doing? I'm going to do you a favor and move out. Do me a favor? I'll need about 200,000 yen. My friend's working for this third-rate college. He can get me in for 200,000. That's cheap compared to the others. Not everyone gets a chance like this. 200,000's not much for you. Idiot! I'm not made of money. If you fail this time, you'll study to become a barber. That's not for me. Let Keiko become a hairdresser. You've been fooling around ever since you finished high school. No money for you until you pass the entrance exam on your own. I see. Well, all right, then. Keiko, watch out. He'll make a prostitute out of you yet. Subu, she didn't show up last time. I was disappointed. I'm terribly sorry. She backed out unexpectedly. I see. But she's willing now? Yes, and she tells me she's doing it just for the money. That shocked me. I can't figure out the girls of today. That's very interesting. Here's a doctor's certificate. You didn't have to do that. But I have a responsibility. It's dated yesterday. Your guest is here. Is the baby all right? I'll just be going. Good. Here you go. Thank you for the holy card. You must give up men starting today. I know. If you break your vow, your husband's soul will never rest. And it's not good for your health. I'm all right. You never know, even in hospitals. Stop it, Take. I want to leave all that behind me. Then I must visit the shrine again. Give me something of yours to take with me. Take, thank you so much. Didn't you go to school? Did Koichi come here last night? Yes. Why? Did he say anything? Nothing in particular. Why? What? Is it about Mr. Ogata? I see. It is. Did he do something to you? Something happened, didn't it? What was it? Tell me, Keiko. I won't get angry. He... bothers me. I see. It's all my fault. He's so persistent. I was afraid of that... but hearing this makes me very sad. I'll tell him to stop it. I will. And if he doesn't, I'll leave him. Ma! Are you all right? I'm okay. I'm sorry you have to go through this. When I think of you, I can't even sleep at night, I'm so worried. Mr. Ogata's coming. I don't want to see him. Go now. Honey. What is it? You know I'm so grateful to you. But now I'm only a burden, and I don't know when I'll get better. What are you saying? So you can leave me. You're talking nonsense. Where did you get such an idea? It's just how I feel. The picture's pretty good. I've thought a lot about us. And if you would... would you please marry Keiko? And one more thing, if you would: Look after Koichi. It's odd, but it's not like it's never happened before. And I think Keiko likes you. She's only 15 years old! I know. I don't mean right now. After she finishes high school. This is crazy. Keiko was here a few minutes ago. She spoke of nothing but you. Don't you think she's aware of boys? Are you crazy or something? Forget this nonsense and get some sleep. You look pale. I'm serious. Go to sleep. This is dirty. I'll take it home later. What do you think, honey? You're the only one for me. I have no intention of leaving you. But, honey... Just get well so you can have our baby. You're only 38 years old. It must be hard for you. The work takes a lot of energy. I'm sorry. By the way, about your property. I might have to borrow money on it. Would you give me the documents? They're still in my husband's name. They'll have to be changed in court. The lawyer's working on it. I see. Ask him to hurry, all right? Where's the bank book? Koichi took it to give it to you last night. 400,000 yen. Damn! So that's what he was after! Too bad. One more year and you'd have a nice apartment house. Yes, but I need the money now. Would you take a check? I want cash. Keiko? It's Kabo. What is it? I found a nice house for a laboratory in Moriguchi. There, the house with the lights on. - The barber shop, right? - Yes. Are you sure about this? You might regret it. I'm only introducing them to you. I won't regret it. You say that now. Just go home and study your books. Mind your own business. I'll do as I like. I'm just looking for kicks. Let's go somewhere, Gin. Harigaya sent us. Where's the 8mm film? What? We don't have any such thing. Stop lying! We know better. So hand it over. But we don't have any film! Search the house. I hid it where they'll never look. Kabo, you think Banteki's place is safer? I think so. But it's probably best to move to the Moriguchi place. Damn! Master? Shall I help out here? What? I used to help the hairdresser in the Kyoto studio. It'd be almost the same thing. I could get licensed. Let's keep this shop going. Great. My wife would be very happy. Then you could live here. Beautiful work. I bet Kabo did it. Any good photographer could do that. I won't arrest you for this one, so go ahead and tell me. I don't know. But what's this got to do with Keiko? Ginjiro Sekiguchi's the leader. They stole 30,000 yen and left this in the safe. We're debating whether or not to let Keiko return. You're her guardian... but you're out on probation yourself. Perhaps I'm not the best guardian for her. Oh, here she is. But we don't have to send her to reform school. And since her teacher's here too, this time we'll let her come back. Madam, please look after her well. But no more of your stupid tricks! Listen to him. Ginjiro will be put on trial. So she might have to appear then. Let us know where you'll be. What will happen to Sekiguchi? I don't know. He's got a record. Looks like it'll be reform school for a year or so. Keep him two or three years. Careful. Next time I catch you, I won't go easy on you. Sorry to have bothered you this way. Not at all. I'm just sorry this happened. And just a month before the exam. Let's concentrate on studying. You can do it, you know. Right. It'll do you good. Please help her all you can. Yes. Of course. One other thing. Private schools require a donation. Usually about 100,000. But if the exam's below average, the donation has to increase. I see. 100,000 yen. Please think about it and let me know. Thank you so much. She'll be there without fail. Everything depends on money. Aren't you hungry? Let's go home. It must've been tough for you in there. Poor dear. But why did you leave that picture? Why did you do a silly thing like that? It wasn't silly. I did it to send you to jail. I sent those bums to get you. What? I won't go to school on your money. After a year in reform school, he'll be a big man. What happened to the others? Niida's working for his family, selling bean curd. Tomorrow he's taking a test for an engineering job. Keiko, you must be lonesome without a boyfriend. I'm okay. Well, I've got to go. Where are you going? My night job. Bye. What night job? A tutor goes to his house. After all, he's a rich kid. Keiko, want to go out with me? Leave me alone. - You're fast. - I guess I am. My turn. Idiot. Didn't you tell her I wanted her too? There's no time. No fair. You got your chance. Put that knife down. I was just going to cut this. Got any money? Thanks. Wait for me. I've got to get my clothes. No time. We're leaving now. Wait. I'll come with you. With us? What do you mean? We're going back. - Back where? - To the reform school. Why? You just escaped. They'll catch us anyway, so we're going to be good little boys. Besides, this running around makes me hungry. Makoto, that's enough now. Let's go. Let me kiss you good-bye. Not today. Maybe next time. Let's go now. Keiko, thanks a lot. Bastards! Welcome. What's all this? They took it all out with a truck. The Crow Gang? No, it was Koichi. He did it while customers were here. Koichi? How dare he! All done, sir. I'm sorry about all this. Upstairs too? You know, this haircut... isn't it kind of old-fashioned? It's a GI cut. Really? Looks more like a wig to me. It looks really great on you. How much? 200 yen. It's cheap enough. Thank you very much. Come again. I wouldn't dare. Where's Keiko? She came home, changed clothes, and went out again. Changed clothes? I tried to stop her, but she said someone was waiting for her. And she kept showing off like this. Have you seen Keiko? Where's Keiko? - I don't know. Do you? - Haven't see her. Excuse me. Do you know where Keiko Matsuda is? Keiko Matsuda. I'm not sure. Maybe she went to Miharu with the boys. Miharu? Where is that? That way. Keiko! What are you doing? Listen, I have my rights. This isn't a democracy, you bum. Get out! You say my business is filthy, but you're wrong. If it weren't for me, many people would suffer. I'm better than white-collar men. My work may be immoral, but I treat everyone honestly, damn it! I love you. It's not out of sympathy. I just don't want to let you go. Stop this nonsense and go to school, and when you finish, marry me. But it's so weird. What's weird about it? It's how your mother wants it. What's so funny? Daddy. You call me Daddy, but I don't feel- I can take Ma's place. But, Daddy, you'll give me money, all right? Mr. Ogata, what are you doing? What am I doing? Why, you should know. It's no good. You mentioned money at the wrong time. This is going to be difficult. Very difficult. You scared me. I thought it was your dad. Here, this is for you. About that money you gave me a while ago. Yes, pay me back soon. Mr. Ogata was upset. It's to be used for our new life. Our? What do you mean? Me and my common-law wife. Your common-law wife? Just like you. But you took Mr. Ogata's money and all the barber shop equipment. Of course. I have to look out for myself. You are so wicked. I don't know about your tramp, but you can't do this to Mr. Ogata. Why? You're only after his money too. No, it's not only his money. Oh? You love him? I have a right to be happy. Then you betrayed my father. No, you're wrong. Don't you feel guilty about the way you've sacrificed Keiko? No, you're all wrong. What's the matter with you, Ma? I love all of you. I know I shouldn't. That's why... What's the matter? You look odd. You know, she's kind of sensitive right now. She's pregnant, so be nice to her. That scarf you knit for me... What's the matter? Ma? Look happy. She's come to see you. Damn. Their capacity is only 300, but they enrolled 500 students. Always business first. Thieves! I wonder how many of them are virgins. Hey, Banteki. Ah, Subu. I've been looking for you. I'm sorry. Eighth race? What number did you bet on? 3-2. That doctor keeps pestering me for his order. Haven't you got the printer yet? They're shipping it from Tokyo tomorrow. That'll be a few more days. It took time to convert it to color. But look at this, Subu. It's all black. I'm studying every day. "Color Processing." I'm working hard at it. That's good. Those policemen. They've nothing better to do than worry about sex. The schoolgirl film is finished. That's good. I saw the same girl on TV a while ago. Looks stupid to me, but some people like it. Why do they all want a woman? Why? It's only natural. Is that right? You really don't go for women? I do sometimes. But you know, a woman's body strikes me as dirty. Doing it yourself is much better. Besides, I can do it whenever I feel like it. You're a strange man. But why do you always supply girls for other men? For all the trouble, it doesn't even pay. You've got a point there. I got into it for the money, but lately I've been losing my touch. I'm just sorry for man's fate. What's that? Stick around. You'll see. Men are pathetic creatures. What's that medicine? It's for energy. Made in Hong Kong. For impotent men? Your wife's sick. Can she take it? That's none of your business. I'm sorry she had to be moved, but because of her condition, she sometimes bothers the others. You mean her singing? Yes. Her voice is so loud. It's no doubt a temporary condition. What kind of songs does she sing? They're quite vulgar. I'd be embarrassed to even tell you the words. I asked you to come because she's three months pregnant. I recommend an abortion, but I need your approval. I'd like to speak to her first. Please. How do you feel? Any better? Yes, much better. You look better. You can have the baby. Do you think so? Sure. Your stomach's okay? Yes, but I wish my heart was good. You seem to be all right. The doctor was only scaring me. That feels good. What's this? What's the matter? Nothing. I just feel strange. No, honey. That tickles. The Hong Kong medicine's working. Stay still. Don't move. Haru. Honey, don't. Don't do that. I - Koichi. I want to get well and live with all of you again. You will. Don't worry. You've still got what it takes. You're naughty. Who's there? Koichi? Living with a prostitute. Nobody's here. Yes, there is. Keiko? She's not here. Are you all right? - Honey. - What? Go to heaven now. Don't stay around here. I'll take care of the barber shop. Haru. I have the papers right here. I always keep them with me. This is very strange. Did you excite her in any way? Please come quickly. You've got to save her, and the baby too. Man and woman Needle and thread Honey, don't die now. Don't die. Don't follow that carp. I really loved you. I really did. Keiko's right here. Kei... Ko... ichi... It's all right. Don't worry. Leave them to me. I'll look after them, so don't worry. Haru, I know this isn't a good time... but you know those papers and the seal? Where are they? Where? Do you feel better? It's all right. I know, I know. You've had a rough time for so long. I understand, honey. You and I are alike. We're honest. Sometimes too honest. Do you feel better? I love you. I love you so. Human beings are made this way. We're made like this. Thank you for attending this ceremony. Please step forward to make your offering. Please come up one by one. We appreciate your cooperation. You damn carp! You kept after her until she followed you. Idiot! You made me impotent again! Get back where you belong! Master, Banteki's run off on us! What's that? Camera, printer, everything. He took it all and joined the Crows. That bastard! We can't even call the police. What a business. I know all you've been through, but don't give up. In six months or so, we'll buy a new camera. I'll help you. Thanks. Mr. Ogata, the lawyer's here. With the 1.5 million yen from my life insurance, construct a tomb for me and my husband. To Koichi I give the land. I want Keiko to have the house. Marry Mr. Ogata and look after Koichi. When Mr. Ogata dies, I'd like him to join me and my husband in our tomb. I'll tell my husband he took good care of me. Koichi and Keiko, be nice to Mr. Ogata. Signed: Haru Matsuda. Witness: Eitaro Yokoyama. With these remains of Haru's, I've got the best part. Back to the primitive way of life. Orgies are the way to freedom. Pathetic, pathetic male. Females are motivated by greed. Is everyone alive here or what? Behaving like stupefied animals. Tossing and moaning. You're alive! Work harder. Start your engines. This is the only thing you can be sure of... until you die. And even after you die. Wherever you are, heaven or hell, without sex there's no point. So go. Have at it. Go! Don't stop. Kabo, are you there? Yes, I'm here. Boy am I tired! You look worn out. I'm beat. I thought an orgy would cheer me up. But there's no kick. My body's like a dead fish. I wonder why. That's bad. Banteki said it was freedom. It's the other way around. We didn't make much money either. Orgies are just like prostitution in large groups. We should see about getting in that line of business. But I'm afraid I couldn't perform. You still love your dead wife. Stop talking like that. But look at how cruel Keiko is, bringing all those guys home. Even if you can't do it now- Don't say that. It's my fault. That's why I don't like women. Greedy, lecherous creatures. It's always somebody else's fault. And yet men go for it. I don't understand it. No one can understand the relationship between the sexes. There's no form to it, nothing you can pinpoint. If we were machines, it'd be easy. Right! Machines are much better. I worked in a factory once. Machines are honest, and they're never greedy. They're quiet and never complain. Machines... Master, what's the matter? That's it: a machine! A doll-a Dutch wife. An eternal virgin. Of course, you'd only have to repair one part. Obedient, quiet. Never cheats on you. Doesn't ask you for money. All sizes. Better than masturbation. - Freedom from women. - It'll free women too. Laws against prostitution won't affect us. It'll stop juvenile delinquency. The epitome of mechanical culture! Dutch wife! A Dutch wife for true freedom! Dutch wife! I'll make a Dutch wife! Keiko, I heard some terrible things about you, but I'm amazed. You've really straightened out. I'm 20 now. Old enough to know better. But it's not that easy. Look at Ginjiro. A gangster now. And others get into indecent work. I don't mean your work's indecent. I know. Don't worry. We're all finished. Very nice. I look years younger. Please come again. Some tea, please. Don't bother. I have to be going. I have a meeting. Exam time is so hectic for us teachers. My husband's a teacher too. Keiko, how much do I owe you? She kept up the chatter and left without paying for the set. She did it on purpose. Her husband's just as bad. He's at my place a lot recently. He can afford to drink because it's exam time. - What a pain in the neck he is. - That's right. They both take bribes like mad. People never miss a chance to take advantage of others. Right. That's the way it is. Delinquent at 10, a big boss at the age of 15. At 20, just a nobody. Money controls everything. Hello, everybody. Keiko, did you get the holy card for me? It's over there. Thanks once again. No trouble at all. Thank you. I'll come by later. You believe in that Ikoma shrine? I figure there's no harm in it. But does it help you? Well, business is going okay. Yes, it seems to be. Welcome. What an easy life a college student has! He owns part of this business. He put up part of the money for it. Well, I'll be going now. - All right, but be back before 6:00. - I know. I can't understand young people. Yes, one can't figure them out. - Is this all right? - Yes, that's fine. Mr. Ogata. Yes. Who is it? Koichi. I brought the president of the Kyoei Company. He's been holed up here for five years working on the doll. I'm Furukawa. How do you do? I've seen the pictures. We're interested in it for the South Pole. I'm here to discuss business. Of course, we haven't got a letter from the government, but I heard the Katabayashi and Sakurai firms are interested. And so? We've been studying this problem for some time. Those young men just don't have it. We want to construct a woman, and we need the advice of an expert. I heard about your work, Mr. Ogata. I checked into your background. I knew you were our man! But the South Pole is only- I know. Not a big enough market. But this thing could really take off in exports. Someday astronauts will take your doll with them into space! How about it? Will you join my firm? I'll pay you well. It sounds like a good deal. Daddy. Daddy, here. Thank you so much. That's 300 yen. Wow! It's good and fresh. I'll pay you later. Like I have a choice. Keiko. What? Please show me your body. I'd like to compare it with the doll. Don't be stupid. He's really working on it. Show him the inside. No! I refuse. Refuse? But I'll pay you. I refuse. I don't work for money. What do you mean? You never said that before. I won't let them take my doll to the South Pole. I won't let them touch it! Mr. Ogata, I understand how- Shut up! You fools could never see the value of my work. You're being rude. Take this million yen, please. Nothing will change my mind. Mr. Ogata, please. Crazy fool. You're the expert with machines, so teach me. I started the hair last month. Well, you've done good work. Tell me... can you still not do it? When this is finished, I'll be able to. Why is that? I don't know. I just think so. But this is so big. Is there a man who can take this? It's good because it's big. Is that right? You still don't like women? Well, I've changed a bit lately. I have a girlfriend... kind of. She's my sister. She's just like my mother. So nice. She says she just loves to take care of me. She's so cute. We're not married, so we don't have to have sex. Then you haven't changed at all. Is that right? It's not natural. But you're not natural either. How's that? This is very well made and all, but it's a machine, isn't it? You think a machine can cure you? You said machines never deceive you. Yes, I did... but it's still not natural. Hand me the needle. You're silly. The truth is... this is alive. Oh, the light's gone out. Haru, I'll light a candle. Wait just a minute. The house shakes so much. In each hair... are my agony and tears. That hurts? All right. There. After these are all in place, you'll never experience this kind of pain again. But then the real agony starts. Huh? It's all right. That's the way life is. Just a little bit more. Just a little. Man and woman Needle and thread THE END Do you understand that guy? No, I don't. You think he's gonna die? I don't get it. Let's watch the next one. Kabo, start the next one. I'm so tired. Come on. Hurry up.
