Subtitles by explosiveskull Is he dancing? I do the twist, that's so '60s. There you go. That's what we all do. Hello, everyone. Hello. I would like to make a toast. Where is the man of the night? - Get out, Richard Blumstein. - Get up there. There he is. Now, I've known Richie a long, long time. As a matter of fact, I remember when we used to skip gym class and smoke pot - behind the bleachers. - Not. And now he's a judge. Well, Bob, considering all the tomfoolery you talked me into those days, it's no wonder what a clown you turned out to be. - Let's make a long story short. - Too late. Richard's one of my best friends, and I'm honored to be able to raise my glass with you on your 45th birthday. Now, even though another year has passed, he doesn't seem any older than the last. Or any younger. Hey, let's arrest that obviously drunken man. To Richie. - To Richie. - Thank you, Bob. Everyone. Oh, Lord. I'm not used to seeing these two like that. They're usually so uptight. Sweetheart, when you've worked with these guys as long as I have, you learn they only care about two things. Law and liquor. Can I ask you a question? Don't be shy, honey. Do you think I'm wasting my time here? What do you mean? Well, since the divorce, I have my daughter, and her future to think about, and... There's an opening in paralegal. Thinking about taking it. Yeah, just talk to Bob about it tonight. Yeah? What would I say? Be yourself. What's the worst that could happen? Hey Mr. Simmons, do you have a minute? For you Ms. Lindberg, I've got several. Well, I wanted to talk to you about that paralegal position that just opened up. Oh, really. - Yeah. - You don't say. I was wondering if you could... If I'd be willing to put in a good word for you? Yeah. Yeah. You know, I could get you the interview. And I'm sure that my recommendation can get you that position. But, what kind of position would you be willing to give me? Mr. Jenkins, I, uh, I... Come on, Sally. We're all adults here. I'm sure we can come to some agreement. I, uh, I don't know if, uh... Shh. Why don't meet upstairs in about 15 minutes and we'll talk about it? Okay? Listen, Jimmy, don't let this thing get you up. These things happen. Happen? That guy got away with murder. Innocent until proven guilty, and he wasn't. How can you say that? I don't understand. Are you gonna let this eat you up all night? We have a job to do. Is this the right place? Yeah, 139 River. Doesn't look like anyone's been home all day. Anonymous calls have a way of not being too reliable. Wait, so we came all the way out here to appease some nervous old cat lady? - Shit. - Did that come from inside? Go around back, I'll call for backup. Cobb. Cobb, come in. Cobb. It's a goddamn massacre back here. Where the hell are you? Goddammit, Cobb. Fuck. Help me. Ma'am, I'm a police officer. I'm here to help. Is the person who did this to you still in the house? What happened in there? They're all dead. He killed them all. Hello. Hello. So what do we have here? 15-year-old female. Body was dumped here sometime late last night. - Jealous boyfriend? - Doubtful. Her heart was ripped clean out. Oh, God. Shit. Yeah, someone sure did a number on her. You can say that again. Hang on a second. Did you see this? No, I didn't. Who is that? Hey. Look what I found. Thank you, officer. - Who's that? - I don't know. I found it under the body, thought maybe you'd recognize her. I'll take it down to evidence when we get to the station. The mother's already down there. She ID'd the body earlier. I say we start by interviewing her friends. I hear they hang out at the video store down town. You think they'll be able to help? We gotta start somewhere. I'm not a police officer, I'm a detective. There's no reason to be afraid. I'm Detective Cobb, and this is Detective Fincher. Look, man, we're not doing anything wrong. Did you kids know a Suzette Sinclair? Seen her around from time to time. Does she hang out here often? Kinda, she doesn't have many friends. What about you? Are you guys friends? Have you seen her lately? No, I wouldn't say we were friends. So, you didn't like her? No, nothing like that. Just, we had chemistry together. So what about a boyfriend? Did she have a boyfriend? I really don't know. Anything that you could think of would help us. - Enemies, bullies, maybe an ex-boyfriend. - What's this about? - We said we don't know her, man. - Well, obviously somebody knew her. We found her dead this morning. Somebody killed her and dumped her body by the McNeil Cabin. Well, we had nothing to do with that. - No one said you did. - Why don't you stay out of it? It's none of your fucking business, you little harlot. Oh, get lost, loser. She doesn't wanna see you anymore. Is this true, Danielle, huh? - What kind of lies has she been telling you about me? - Hey! Is there a problem here? Why don't you just keep out of this, old man? It doesn't concern you. Get back to your Studebaker. Why don't you let the girls alone and be on your way, huh? Who the fuck do you think you are? That's who the fuck I think I am. Now, leave the girls alone, hot shot. Fine. But we'll finish this later, Danielle. You can count on that. And as for you. Here's what I think of your fuckin' badge, pig. Thank you, officer. Detective. Fuckin' asshole! That's your boyfriend? Ex-boyfriend. Doesn't know when to quit. Well, if he tries anything like that again, here's my card, give me a call. - Okay. - Okay. Do you mind if I ask you girls something? I'm investigating the murder of Suzette Sinclair. Did you know her? Not really. Well, sort of. We just went to junior high school together. When was the last time you spoke to her? About a month ago. I saw her walking away down the hall. She was going to math class. Did she have any enemies that you know of? We really wouldn't know. Like she said, we hadn't hung out with her in a long time. Well, I'll tell you what. If you think of anything that could help me, I'd really appreciate it. My number's on the card. - Thanks. - Yeah. - You get anything? - No. This girl doesn't have any friends. It doesn't look like anybody would be throwing a party knowing that she's dead though. - Oh, shit. - What? I was supposed to meet Jenny for lunch. Good luck with that one. All right, let's get back to the station. Maybe I can still make it. Jenny. Jenny, wait. Just, I can explain. Explain what? That you forgot that I was waiting for you again? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm working on a case. Yeah, you are always working. All I asked was one hour of your time so you could help plan your little girl's birthday party. Jen, I don't need the criticism. I've always been there for my daughter. Oh, really? Well when was the last time you made it down to one of her soccer games? I know, I'm sorry, I'm doing the best I can. But it's hard, I have a job to do. And you think that I don't? I work just like you and I still manage to find time for her. All right, regardless of what you may think, she is just as important to me as she is to you. I am still her father. I waited here for over an hour, James. You know what, forget it. I will take care of all the plans myself. All you need to do is show up. Can you handle that? Yes, yes. - Of course. - Good. And you better be there. The only thing in the world that that little girl wants is for her father to be at her birthday party. You know what, you can disappoint me all you want. I've already made up my mind what a deadbeat you are. But I will not stand by and watch you continue to break her heart. I'm sorry. I promise I'll be there. You know, when I married a cop, I thought that I would have somebody in my life that would always be there. Somebody that would always be there to protect me and the family that we created together. But you would have to actually be there to protect us. Jenny. Jim, if you are not there, do not bother coming back. Hello. Oh, hi, Mrs. Collingwood. Yes, she's fine. She's asleep. We watched... No. Vicky's dad is the new landlord. I know. Uh, what? No, yeah, yeah, yeah. She went to sleep right afterwards. No, no. You guys take your time. No, I have homework to do anyway. You guys have fun. Okay. I'll see you guys in a few hours. Bye, Mrs. Collingwood. Ryan. - Sorry. - I told you to be quiet. Sorry, do you think they heard? No, I don't think so. Good. So what do you wanna do? Yeah. I don't know. What do you wanna do? I don't know. I thought we were gonna watch a movie. Yeah, yeah. Let's watch a movie. And maybe we could um, I don't know, fool around on the couch a little. But what if Christine wakes up? I'll be quiet. We offer a last resort for our clients. For most, we are the final place to turn. So call us now... 1-800-MDK4YOU. That's 1-800-MDK4YOU. Call us now and fight back today. We interrupt this broadcast to bring you late breaking news. Tragedy struck our small town earlier today. Authorities have stated they're investigating the death of young Suzette Sinclair. Hold on. - Hello. - Are you watching this? No, I'm doing my nails. - Put on the news. - Why? Just do it. Sinclair was the daughter of Robert Jenkins, a local district attorney who was killed nearly ten years ago along with 23 others in the Havenwood fire at Blumsfield Manor. Oh, wow, that is so cool. She's dead, Carla. Cool is not the word I would use. She's on the news though. That's pretty bitchin'. Do you think they'll catch him? Who knows? This break sucks. - Carla? - What? Are you even hearing this? What would you like me to do about it? I don't know. Oh, my God, chill out, Danielle. You act like this guy is after you or something. Don't say that. I don't even wanna talk about it anymore. Well, you called me to talk about it. I know, it's just... I guess I'll see you tomorrow. Oh, don't be like that, Danielle. Hey, I know what you need. You need a party. - A what? - A party. Didn't you say your parents were gone away this weekend? - No. Carla. - Yeah. Yes, yes yes yes. - We'll have a party on Friday night. - No way. I'll invite some of the girls. I'll have Glen get us beer, we'll get pizza delivered, rent movies, it'll be awesome. - No, no no. - Yes, yes, yes, yes. - I'm calling Jessica right now. Bye. - No. - Carla. - Hmm. Ugh. Are you happy now? Are you happy? Brian. Brian. Brian. Brian. Brian. Where the hell have you been? Oh, sorry, I slept late. Well, fix your goddamn tie, clean yourself up a bit for Christ's sake. You look like dog shit. So, what did I miss? Double murder. Teenagers. The girl, Mari Lindberg, and the boyfriend, Brian Tennant. Where are the parents? We haven't been able to locate any of the boy's family as of yet. The girl's mother died a few years ago, and the father is away on business. Who found the body? She was babysitting the neighbor's daughter. They say they came home a little bit early. She was already gone. Obviously upset. They tried calling her, and got no response. Having a spare key, they let themselves in, and they found her. So what happened? She left the kid alone to have a fling with the boyfriend? We found blood on the rear window of the neighbor's house. So you're saying he abducted her at the neighbor's house and brought her here? Seems like it. What about the boyfriend here? Well, we found him dumped in the backyard in the shed. Apparently, he only wanted her. The boyfriend was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. What makes you say that? Oh. Jesus. How long has she been like this? About 36 hours. Nearly two days? Are you sure? Well, based on the congealment of all her blood, I'm guessing the time of death to be about 10 PM. Just like the last one. What does this guy want? I think he's sending a message, Detective. A message? You don't think he'd go through all this for fun, do you? You know what, do me a favor. You take care of the body. We'll do the thinking around here, okay? See this? Look, look. Is this one of the Sinclair girl? Uh-huh, same photo. What are you still doin' with that? I forgot to submit it to evidence. Listen, you can't be walking around with evidence in your pocket. Look, I didn't do it on purpose, all right? Excuses, excuses, and more excuses. And I know you're still drinking. I am not still drinking. Don't bullshit me. I can smell it on you. You know what? Do me a favor. Get out of here. Just go home. Go home? If you don't like it, take it up with the Captain. - Fincher. - Detective, meet me at the overlook by the park tomorrow at five p.m. I have something for you. Don't be late. Who is this? Hello? Who is this? Hello? And I do have some stuff here. And I wanted to let you know... Some of the stuff... I'm a little worried, yeah. It's not gonna look good. 'Cause we can see from these surveillance photos here. God. What? We saw this young lady... So, why are we getting a movie again? Why not? I don't know. It's just... Are we really gonna watch it? So, fine then, you just want us to sit around in silence all night? You know what I mean. You never end up watching it anyway. - Fine. - Thank you. Watch out, asshole. Slut. Excuse you. Oh, bitchin'! I know a drinking game to go with this one. A drinking game? Sweetie, you will soon learn that there is a drinking game to go with anything. What the hell? Shit! You really scared me back into the '70s, old man. Come on, Carla, let's just go. I scared you? There are a lot scarier things in here. Yeah, well, right now all I see is you. Seems like a lot of young girls are going missing lately. What the hell are you talking about? Couldn't help but overhear, you ladies are worried of the killer. You're not gonna scare me, old man. Such a shame. Such pretty girls. Flesh is fresher, the blood more potent. He takes them. - Takes them young. - Take your hands off of us, you creepazoid. Just watch yourselves, girls. He's back. - No one's safe. - Screw you, nut job. Come on, Danielle. What the hell is going on over here? Find you. Find you all. - He'll find you all! - What are you doing? Let's go already. No one is safe! Didn't figure you for a quitter, Detective. You? What the hell do you want? Told you I have something for you. Well, let me have it then. My information is expensive. Is this the kind of conversation you wanna have? That's fine, I'll just take it up with your supervisor at the coroner's office. Okay, okay, fine. You win. Give me one reason I should even be standing here. You need this information. These murders are connected. And the ripper is to blame. Ripper? What the hell are you talking about? Don't waste my time. I'm not wasting anyone's time. Explain yourself then. Here, take a look. How the hell did you even find out about all of this? Look at me, Detective. Do I look like a child? I remember what happened that night. And now what? Are you gonna extort me? This isn't blackmail. - I'm just trying to... - People of this town don't know what happened that night. And the people who do aren't gonna start talking about it now. They don't even know the Ripper existed. - Look familiar? That's... - Yeah, I know who that is. That's Gerald Vatetta. He was accused of molesting his daughter, but they couldn't get a conviction. And she died in a car accident a few months later. That was no accident, Detective, and you know it. He blamed everyone, and he killed them all in return. - You mean... - The ripper wasn't some lunatic on a murder spree. Gerald Vatetta was out for revenge. How do I know I can trust you? - How much choice do you have? - Listen, man, I don't know... No, you listen to me, man. Ripper nearly destroyed your career before it even started. You were so obsessed with him you didn't see your life falling apart right in front of you. Your wife left you, your daughter barely knows who you are, and if it wasn't for that partner of yours, you'd be working some school crosswalk right now. You need this information. Yeah, well how am I supposed to say I found it? You're a detective, do your job. This man is still out there, and he's gonna kill again. But why? Why disappear for ten years before suddenly reappearing again? I haven't figured that out yet. You have access to files that I don't. Sealed documents. Oh, you just expect me to waltz into the file room - at the police station and go rifling through... - No, I don't expect anything from you, Detective. You do what you want with this. You're on to something here. I'm just trying to help. Detective. If you're gonna catch this guy, you're gonna have to start thinking like a killer. What the hell is this bullshit. Hey. What? What the fuck? Stop. Hey. - What are you doing here? - I wanted to apologize. Apologize? - It's 4:30 in the morning. - Yeah, yeah yeah. I just wanted to come by and say I'm sorry. - Are you drunk? - No. No, I'm not drunk. - Jesus, Jim, have you even slept yet? - No. I mean, I was up all night, I was thinking about it. - Listen, can I just come in... - No, I don't think that's such a good idea. Well, why not? I wanted to see my little girl. Oh, you're little girl needs a father, not a stranger who's gonna come and go as he pleases. Right, look, I was on my way, I got her the present. - I did, and I was... lost tracked of time. - No, just save your breath. Just save your breath. I'm tired of your bullshit excuses. I meant what I said to you the other day. I want you out of my life for good. I don't wanna hear anymore of your empty promises and your selfish lies. I want you to turn around and leave. - No, I can't. - No, you are not gonna hurt her anymore. Now, look, she's still my daughter. You understand me? You can not get rid of me that easy. Oh, well, I can sure as hell try. You know, she's young enough now that maybe in time she'll forget all about you and what you did to her. Even if her father is a waste, she won't remember. A waste? Goodbye, Jim. Goodbye. Take it easy, man. I don't want any problems, all right? Whoa. And just what the hell were you thinking? I told you, I fell and it went off. You fell and it went off. And monkeys might fly out of my ass. What do you have to say about this? And don't give me any of that "Oh, he's my partner," horse shit. If you knew he was off the wagon, and you didn't report that to me, you are as responsible for this incident as he is. I can not have my detectives on the biggest case this town has ever seen, running around drunk, shooting at innocent civilians. I didn't know he had reached that point. Well, clearly he has. You need to surrender your badge and your gun. You're suspended indefinitely. Effective immediately. No, no, you can't. - I got a lead on this case. - Oh, what? Your meeting with your little friend in the park? Yeah, I've already spoken to his supervisor. We're gonna be bringing him up on charges for stolen evidence. I've had enough of this crap. You're off this case, I'm assigning it to somebody else. Wait a minute. I've been working on this for a week, you can't just... Shut your mouth. He's lucky I don't throw him in a cell with his little ginger friend. And you're lucky you're not on suspension for insubordination. - What? - Enough. Your badge, your gun, now. Fine. Now get the hell out of my precinct before I do lock you up. Captain, if you just give me a little bit more time, - I can get him in shape. - No, no. You did things your way, now we're doing them my way. And I don't care how long I had known you. You watch yourself around here. You're on very thin ice. Yeah, yeah I did. Oh, my God, yes. Oh, my God, I'll be right there. Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God. Mom, I'm taking a shower. Okay, let me know before you leave. Yes, mother. Kristin? Honey, are you okay? No! No! No! Okay, guys, now listen. My parents will be back in two days, and if this house is a mess, they're gonna kill me. Danielle, please, lighten up. Yeah, Danielle, don't be such a spaz. Don't worry about her. We're gonna have a good time tonight, and I'm gonna make sure of it. Even if it's the last thing I do. You're gonna take this beer, you're gonna drink it, - and you're gonna like it. - Come on, Carla. You know I don't. And you're gonna like it. What could go wrong? - Let's go. - I'm comin', bitch. Fuck. What the hell are you doin' in here? Research. In the dark? Don't you remember you've been suspended? Take a look at this. Look at that. Remember the photo we found? That's Katie Vatetta. Gerald Vatetta's daughter. She was sent to the orphanage after he was arrested. What does that have to do with you being here tonight? Think of this, think, Walt. Ten years ago we witnessed that massacre. Really? You really think this has something to do with that? Listen, just hear me out. Gerald Vatetta killed all those people that night because he blamed them for his daughter's death. Gerard Vatetta is the Ripper. - That's not possible. - It isn't? So you think it's a coincidence that the Ripper got away and no one's heard from Vatetta since his trial? Look, we worked hard to keep that unknown, and now you're gonna spend all your time digging it up again? We can not put a lid on this this time, Walter. Look, three murders in the past week. Every crime scene with this photo. If you think that's a coincidence, you're out of your mind. - Five. - What? Five murders. They found the bodies of Kristin Thompson and her mother earlier tonight. Thompson. Photo? I've spent all my time chasing after you. Trying to make sure you don't do something stupid. Like you're doing now. Walter, we can not just ignore the facts. The pictures, the dates, the names, they're all the same. Tomorrow is the ten-year anniversary of his daughter's death. Look, look. Sinclair, Lindberg, Tennant, and now, Thompson. Don't you get it? These are the children of all the people that he murdered ten years ago? I'm telling you, man. This guy got away and now he's back to finish the job. We made a mistake back then, Walter. Now we can fix it. It's not our case anymore, James. - Just let it go. - All right, you know what? Forget it. I'll handle it myself. You just don't get it, do you? You run around town like some sort of vigilante. Breaking into the station, stealing files at night, following up on leads built on tainted as well as stolen evidence, going off to meet God knows who, and you want support from me? What are you gonna do if you catch the guy anyway? You know what's gonna happen? Someone else is gonna get the credit and you're gonna get fired. Where were you that night, anyway? What? What are you talking about? Where the hell were you ten years ago? Where did you run off to when you left me in that house to be killed? Why do you want me to forget about it so badly? How do I know you don't have something to do with it? How do I know you're not the one behind all of this? Watch yourself, James. You know I'm only trying to protect you. I'm gonna find him, Walter. I'm gonna find him, and I'm gonna stop him. Once and for all. Now, if you wanna help me, then help me! You know I can't do that. Then you're part of the problem. Fine. If that's the way you want it. But you know what? I've warned you. - Hello. - Jenny. Are you all right? Is Amy okay? James, what do you want? Is Amy okay? Yeah, she's fine, she's with my mother. Why? All right, look, I want you to do me a favor. I want you to pack a bag and go and stay with your mother for a while. My mother? Why? Jenny, I can't explain it. Will you just trust me? Would you just do it please? I don't have time for this right now, James. There's someone at the door now, so... The door? Who is it? It's just Walter. Jenny, do not answer the door, I am begging you. Hi, Walter, James is on the phone with me now. - Do you want to talk to him? - Jenny, do not let him in. Jenny, get out of the house, right now. James, call me back when you come to your senses. Jenny, Jenny! Hello. Fuck! Jenny. What happened? You were right. He's got Jenny. I tried to find him. But, I guess he got the better of me. The Ripper? Where did he go? The orphanage. He has three more sacrifices tonight. Sacrifices? For what? I don't know. I'm really sorry that I didn't believe you. It's okay. I'm gonna get you an ambulance. Hold still. I ran away, James. 911, what is your emergency? That night. I got into the house, I got through the door. But as I was walking around, I saw him bash Jenkins in the back of the head. Hello? I was scared, but I had never seen anything like that before. Here. Go get that son of a bitch. Hello, 911. Tell me about the sacrifices. What the hell are you doing here? You talk to me. What the hell is going on here? - What does he want? - I've got nothing to say to you. Now you listen to me. This son of a bitch has killed six innocent people. My partner is dead, and now he has my wife. You're gonna start talking, and you're gonna talk fast. Okay. Okay, okay. Okay. Now you know something you're not telling me. You gonna let it out, or am I gonna beat it out of you? He needs seven sacrifices. I don't know. All right, all right, okay, okay, okay. He's trying to bring his daughter back. And then seven sacrifices by tonight and the body. Body? To bring her soul back. Jenny. That's all I know, I swear. I swear. I need you to help me get her back. You want me to help you again? You're the only one who knows the Ripper is back. I'm the one who got you this far. Isn't that enough? Everybody thinks I'm crazy. What's in it for me? Please, I have no one else to turn to. Oh, shit. Check those corners. Captain! Captain, get in here. He's dead. Search the building. I want every tenant questioned. His gun is gone. Looks like our favorite alcoholic was here. Fincher? Fernandez. I want an APB put out on Detective Fincher. I want him in for questioning for the murder of Detective Cobb. I can not believe the power of... It is extraordinary. What are you doing? I'm sorry. Can't let you do that. What do you mean you can not? Specimen 58 is too valuable to be destroyed. I'll do anything to make sure it lives. What the hell is this? Serrano Reserve. 121 proof rum. What do you mean? Oh, my God. It tastes like I'm drinking gasoline. Give me that. Let me show you how it's done. Chug, chug, chug... Yeah. Woo! That's how you drink it. This is the orphanage where his daughter was captured before the accident. It's been here all along. I'm sure of it. Wait. Are you sure this is a good idea? It could be a trap. Yeah, I know it's a trap. Gotta save Jenny. Just go and look around for another way in. He's not expecting the both of us. Close these doors behind me. I don't want him knowing we're here yet. What do I do if I find her? Take her and run. What about you? I'm not leaving until this bastard is dead. No. No. Oh, God. What did he do to you? You've got to get out of here. I'm not leaving without you. Jim, he knows that you're here. It's a trap. Goddammit, Jim, just listen to me for once in your life. He's got a list of victims. What? Look over there on the wall. See, he's after you. You have to get out of here. I have to get you out of here now. No! It's okay, it's okay. What happened? He got away. He found me outside. There's nothing you could have done. This whole thing is a trap. It was all my fault. I should have never let you come in by yourself. No, it isn't. It's mine. It should've been me. Oh, shit. What? We've got to find this girl. Who is she? She's the last one. We've got to get to her before he does. Me too? I want my daughter growing up knowing that her mother died protecting her from this monster. We've got to fight him tonight. We'll find her, we'll keep her safe. What about them? Well, they're after me now. I'll come find you. I'll take care of them, now go. Cheers. Woo! Woo, I'm drunk. Gimme that shot glass. Thank you, this one's for Danielle. Come on, Carla. You know I don't. You don't drink, you don't smoke. What do you do? Yeah, Danielle, we're having this party for you. You gotta live a little. Live a little? Half of this stuff will end up killing me. Prude. All right, no. Wait, that was my boob. That was personal. Shh. Shh. Do you hear that? Hear what? That sound. What was that? Someone should go check that out. Not me. Whoa, not me. I'm not going. Not me. Fine, I'll check it out. I love you. Ow, what the fuck? What the hell is your problem? What the hell's my problem? Oh, great, it's the bod squad. Aw, did I scare the little girlies? Get bent, lame wood. I need a cigarette. I need a drink. No, no, no. Not in my parent's house. Come on, Danielle. It's just one cigarette. No, the smoke will never come out. All right, I'll go outside. Fine. I'm with you. Hey, don't leave me alone with these guys. We'll be right back. Yeah. Besides, Dan's kind of cute. What are you guys even doing here? Steph invited us. She said there was gonna be a party here. Well, there's no party, so, you can leave now. Danielle, would you just knock it off? Live much? 'Bout time you showed up. We were hanging with Johnny. You know how he is. Oh, no, you didn't tell him you were coming here, did you? Damn, babe. Take a chill pill. Is she always this bitchy? Don't worry about her. Let's go upstairs and I'll make you feel better. Hey. I'm Dan. What are you? A lesbian? I mean, I feel bad for her, but, at the same time, Donny was such a jerk. He really was. Yeah. Speaking of. We better get back in there before she freaks out on everybody. I'll be there in a second. What, that's it? Come on, baby. I'm a little drunk. Give that a chance. Whatever, I gotta pee. Come on. Don't be like that. Come on, baby, gimme like five minutes. We'll try again. No, I'll give you one minute, and when I get back, Little Peter better be ready. See, I knew it. Little tough love is all you needed. Peter, what the hell? Oh, my God. What the hell is going on up there? Oh, you know. You guys are disgusting. What's your problem? I don't think you're the one with the problem, bro. Oh, my God. I have to pee. Oh, my gosh, Carla. My parents are gonna kill me. Whoops! You're gonna get it. Go wash that up in the sink or something. Fine. Looks like the ratio is improving. You gotta act fast, bro. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Oh, come on, babe. You know what that means. Or this is gonna be the lamest party we have ever been to? We should have just stayed at John's. I get what you're saying, man. But there's enough chicks here for all of us. Look, man, that Regan chick is still outside. She looks like she's down to party. My thoughts exactly, bro. Your friend's a major jerk. I'm a little backed up if you know what I'm sayin'. Carla. Carla, is that you? Hello. Hello. Carla. You know, just screw you all, all right. This isn't funny. What are you doing? Boo. Johnny, what's up man? You came. Danielle's in the house, man. She's gonna freak. What's with the costume, bro? Ah, you guys are assholes. Look, babe, we're just having some fun. You need to relax a bit. Whoa. Dude, what is your problem? What the fuck, man? You girls really know how to throw a party. Dick's right. It's two of us and two of you. So we should be sitting here getting it on, we're sitting here watching Attack Of The Brain People. Do you see what you have done? No one said you had to watch it. What is your malfunction, little girl? Danielle. Oh, what now? Is your virginity knocking? You know what? Why don't you gather up your goons and get the hell out of here. Nobody's stopping you. Hey, guys, I said shut up. What was that sound? Wow, he just does not give up, does he? How could this night get any worse? - Come on out, Danielle. - I'll get rid of him. No no, I can handle it. Later, lame boy. Well, don't let him in the house. After the other day at the video store there's no telling what he's gonna do. Fuck you, and fuck your flowers, Danielle. I'm gonna go make us some drinks. Oh, now, Danielle, one drink's not gonna hurt you. Johnny, you're wasted. What are you doing here? I just came here to tell you that you are a heartless, cold-blooded little bitch. Oh, that's great. Real mature. Is that all? You can leave now. What if I don't wanna leave? What if I just wanna stay here and crash your little whore party with your little whore friends? Will you get out of here before you hurt yourself? Don't you tell me what to do. I don't have to listen to you. You're not my mother. I'm giving you five minutes, and then I'm calling the cops. You mean your detective friend from the other day? I knew it. You're fucking that asshole cop, aren't you? Oh, please. Wow. Fine. I know when I'm not wanted. I'll go. But I have just one more thing I wanna say to you first, Danielle. Just one more thing. That is? What, what is it? Johnny, what's wrong? Oh, God, oh, God. He's dead. He killed him. What did that asshole do to you? That guy outside, he killed him. He killed Johnny, he's dead. What guy? That guy with the mask. A guy with a mask. That's just the boys messing around - that you won't let 'em in. - Oh, God, he's dead. Let me get you a drink. You're gonna feel a lot better. No, no. Oh, my God! Oh, shit. What the fuck are we gonna do? Okay, okay, okay. We'll stay here a minute. Danielle, I know you're scared, but... Stay away from us, don't hurt us. You two okay? Yeah, who are you? I'm here to help. How's your friend? How do you think she is? She's in shock. That maniac killed her boyfriend right in front of her. It's okay. You're safe now. Who is that guy? He's a psychopath. I followed him here. No time to explain now. Trust me, he's probably already in the house. We need to find something for you to defend yourselves with. Defend ourselves with? We need to get the hell out of here. You wanna go out there? Be my guests. You won't last one second on your own. Say the plan. You need to keep her quiet. Do exactly as I say, and I promise we'll get out of here alive. Now, is there anything we can use in this house to protect ourselves with? Look, I've got two shells left. We need more than that. There's a baseball bat at the front door. Okay, good. Is there anyone else in the house? They're all dead. Shit. We're gonna get that bat. Are you crazy? I just told you that lunatic killed all of our friends, and now you want us to help you find him? Either that or sit here and wait for him to find us. Right now we're sitting ducks. And he's a hunter. We have to move. - Freeze! - Don't shoot, don't shoot. Thank God you're alive. How did you find us? I'll explain later. Where is he? He's in the house with that other guy. He's here too? - No, no, please don't leave us. - No, no. He's after you. And he won't stop until you and all your friends are dead. But me, what did I do? It's not you, it's your parents. My parents? Years ago, his daughter was killed and the whole town covered it up, then the guy got away with it. Your father was killed by him. No, my father was killed in the fire. No, no there was no fire. Your father was the judge who pushed the trials through. He made it so there was no way he could get a conviction. The Ripper killed everyone he held responsible, and we covered it up with the fire story. And now he's back. He's back for the children. He wants his daughter back and he thinks you're the key. Now look, you two have gotta get to safety. Go to a neighbor's house or anything. And I want you to call the police, and tell Captain Bracken where we are and what's going on. - What about that other guy? - I'll take care of that other guy. - You guys, go. - You can't. I said run. Go. Shit. I thought you were dead. Where is he? He's gone. No, he's not. He's still here somewhere. I know it. He's outside. He's going after the girls. You can't stop him. - No one can. - Yes, I can. And when I do, I'm gonna bring you his fucking head. No, you won't. - Why'd you stop? - What do you mean? - We can't leave them in there alone. - Are you crazy? We have to try to help them. No, he told us to go get help and to wait there. That's exactly what I'm gonna do. - Now, let's go. - Look, he's after me, not them. My father started this, but I have to finish it. What are you talking about? I'm not going to let them die for me. - We have to try to help. - No, no no no. No, stay here. No. You just go get help, okay? Danielle, come back. Danielle. What the hell are you doing? I won't let you get any further. Why? What the hell is going on here? You thought you were oh so clever. You thought you could all put this behind you. You thought it would all just go away. You were wrong. You were wrong. This town may have forgotten what happened, but I haven't. I loved her, Detective. And you all took her away from me. And now you are gonna pay. Shit. Who are you? I'm a man who should have a wife and a child of his own right now. Katie Vatetta was pregnant when that son of a bitch killed her. That's my child. That was my child! Was my future. That was my chance at a family. That form you had, the one you let slip through your fingers. You're insane. Insane? No. I'm missing the one thing that made me whole. And he is gonna bring her back to me. Why? Why are you helping him? Why now? The Ripper found a way to bring her back. Danielle, she's the one. She's gonna be the resurrection. My Katie. I have a second chance, Detective. A second chance at a family. Yeah. One big happy family. You, a ghost, and dear old dad. - No, oh, no. - You let him do your dirty work, and you think he's gonna just let you have her? No. I won't need him anymore. He doesn't even know who I am. Do you think Katie and I could have told him we were gonna have a baby? You let them believe that he molested his own daughter? I had nothing to do with that. It was convenient though. We're gonna leave. Unfortunately, he was set free, and the orphanage sent her to a foster home. And that's where she was killed. And the Ripper came after all the people who let that drunken asshole off the hook. I've been trying to find him for years. I need you to find him for me though. But you weren't supposed to make it this far. You were supposed to die at the orphanage. Thank God I found you. - We have to leave right now. - Why, what happened? I'll explain later, but we really have to go. - No, we have to help them. - No, come on, please. No, Carla, no! One down, one to go. You're never gonna get away with this. Watch me. See you in hell, motherfucker. Okay, you son of a bitch. Come and get me. Die, you son of a bitch. This one's for my father. Say hello to daughter for me. Jesus. You scared the hell out of me. What happened? It's over. Sorry about your friend. My name's Ryan. Danielle. Subtitles by explosiveskull
