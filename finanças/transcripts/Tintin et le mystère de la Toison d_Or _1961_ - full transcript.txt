Distributed by present Tintin and the mystery of the Golden Fleece With the famous characters from the "Casterman Publishing" cartoon books and the kind support of Herg?. A film by Andr? Barret Directed by Jean-Jacques Vierne 'Marlinspike Hall' How are you? A billion blistering barnacles! Are you mad, my friend? What's going on? A letter for you, Captain Haddock. That's no reason to make so much noise! Well, it's just that... it's not an ordinary letter. It's registered post, and from Turkey. From Turkey? So, Captain, good news? A letter from lstanbul. Oh? Victory! Victory! Victory! My new fuel has been perfected. Well, almost. A new energy source is born - Super Cuthbertiol. Would you like to try it? No, no, thank you, Professor. I really must be going. You're wrong. Professor Calculus. It is my honour and privilege to tell you that this spectacle has gone on long enough. You are right, dear Captain. Science has just made a great, a very great, leap forward. Blasted little fish-man! When will you get it into your head... Your letter, Captain. Oh, yes, the letter. A thousand thundering typhoons. Themistocles Paparanic. That old pirate Paparanic. Oh. Is it serious? Captain Paparanic is dead. He was the best of men. Paparanic... I'll never forget our first encounter off the coast of Sumatra. An unholy storm. Waves like mountains, and his freighter was drifting. Engine breakdown. I managed to tow him. And since the old pirate had a nice face, I refused to take the rescue reward. It's been a good thirty years since we last saw each other. And now... He was very old? "Deceased in his 67th year..." Well, I never... Themistocles Paparanic has left a will, a will that names me as his sole heir? His heir? Professor! Professor! Did you hear what's happened? I've inherited a boat! Absolutely, Captain. With my new fuel, this table will be able to do 50 an hour! I'm not talking to you about this table! I'm talking about my boat! BOAT! Oh, naturally, with boats it's a different problem... But I'll think about it. The ship is called the Golden Fleece. It's anchored at lstanbul. You realise, Captain, that it is clearly specified in the will that in accepting the inheritance, you undertake to honour the contracts that were in force at the time of Commander Paparanic's death. We know. The other lawyer told us. Those are the terms. Ah, it's glorious! Don't you think so, Snowy? When I think that dear Professor Calculus is shut up in his laboratory... Well, he promised to meet us in Athens, the Golden Fleece's first port of call. And from there, we'll all go back home together, carried by the winds and the Captain's whims. Where's my boat, then? That's it there, Captain. That's the Golden Fleece. What? You're not trying to tell me that that miserable heap of scrap metal...! The Golden Fleece, 130-ton freighter, flies the Turkish flag, built in 1913, listed in the Istanbul Shipping Register under number 6520. Clearly, it's not a boat that's much to look at. What do you think, Snowy? Come on, show some spirit! Here, boy! Up! Up! Hello! Any bites? Oh, just like that... Are you the new boss? No, I'm Tintin, a friend of Captain Haddock. Paparanic, ha, now there was a captain. Drank like a fish. It had just gone at midnight. He'd put away a litre of rum chatting away with Romulus. He fell down there, on the deck. Bam, he was dead. Filthy... A billion bilious blistering barnacles! Who's this, then? Captain Haddock. Good morning, Captain. I've just visited the hold. Worthless cargo. As for this rust bucket, I wouldn't give two cents for it. Let's have a look at the cabin anyway. A billion bilious blistering barnacles! May I, Captain? Come on... No need to be scared, it's just Romulus. Another present from Themistocles. Where is the crew? All of them left. You can well imagine, my dear Tintin, that the inmates of this floating coffin jumped ship at the first opportunity... When's the next plane to Paris? What about the call of the sea, Captain? Can you see me sailing this rust bucket? No! I'm going back to Marlinspike. Sorry, my old friend... It's good of you to think of me, but frankly... No So? Well, the Captain is a bit disappointed. It's true that the Golden Fleece is no longer in its first flush of youth, which is why the offer that Mr. Karabin has come to make in person will certainly be of interest to you. Anton Karabin. Gentlemen, Captain Paparanic was a friend to me. I would like to keep this boat. I'll offer you 400,000 Turkish pounds for it. 400,000 Turkish pounds is an exceptional offer. That's 20 million francs. 20 million francs! If this gentleman has a thing for antiques, it's not for me to... Wait! The Captain still has 15 days to accept or refuse the inheritance, doesn't he? 15 days, yes. Well then, we have plenty of time to consider this offer. Right, Captain? Yes. Listen, gentlemen, I am a very busy man. This boat is of great sentimental value to me. This is my final offer: 600,000 Turkish pounds. 30 million francs. It's not worth half that. Mr. Karabin, your offer needs thinking over. Yes. It is difficult for me to sell to a friend what dear Themistocles himself gave to me as a gift. I hope, for both of our sakes, to receive a positive answer. Give these gentlemen my card. I'll see you shortly. 30 million francs for this rust bucket. That man is completely mad. Hmm... He doesn't give that impression, Captain. And I don't trust his way of mixing feelings and figures. So it's all settled, then? I'll write to Professor Calculus that we're going back to Marlinspike? Captain, you're being called. Are you asleep, Captain? Huh, you were saying? You're being called. What does this bashi-bazouk want from me? Hello, yes, that's me. What? But... Is this a joke? But... A billion blistering barnacles! But... Really, sir... But... Hey! Oh, oh! Thundering typhoons! A wrong number? No, not a wrong number. A well-wishing friend advising me to sell the Golden Fleece as quickly as possible. For what reason? It seems that if we don't sell this boat, terrible things could happen to us. Why?... It's a threat! A threat! I'll only sell the boat if I want to! It's mine, isn't it?! What zulu invented this sewer pipe! Please, allow me... This is no doubt the first time sir has smoked the narguileh. Yes, the first and the last. You gentlemen have just arrived in lstanbul? This morning. lf I could be so bold, I would be very honoured to be your guide and show you the hidden treasures of this great city. What do you think, Captain? Well, for once we've met someone who can talk about something other than the Golden Fleece... It's agreed, sir. Snowy! Look out, Captain! I'm terribly sorry, really terribly sorry. That's certainly the first time I've been frightened by a barrel. One last thing, Captain, this way. Today's grand finale - from the top of this tower, the most beautiful view of lstanbul. Come, gentlemen, come. What... We're locked in! Locked in? Mr. Malik, Mr. Malik! Let's try this way! What does this mean? Well, I never! Do you have a match? Here, in my pocket. Nothing broken, Captain? A vase. Yours. This way, quick! We have to block their path. Yes. Yes. We'll find a way to get out of here. Gunners, to the cannons! Fire! Port side! Fire! Starboard side! Fire! I can explain, it's all a misunderstanding. You got them into this ambush. You have to get them out of it. But what do you want me to do? You're going to tell them that the police are coming. Ostrogoths! Illiterates! Ectoplasms! Vermicelli! Subspecies of narguileh! They left thanks to me. You see I'm not a bad man. Yes. I do work as a guide for foreigners. They gave me ten pounds to show you around the city. Who gave you ten pounds? A man in a caf?. You don't know his name, of course... All I can tell you is that he gave me this paper, here, in my pocket. You see... it's our tour route. Argh... Blasted...! Let him go, Captain. We won't get anything more out of him. A message, my Captain. 900,000 pounds! The bids are getting higher! But what on earth do they see in this boat? Maybe they're interested in the cargo. Cheap carpets, rubbishy stuff. Are you quite sure? Are you afraid of dust? Come with me. Take this. Items of no interest whatsoever. There... I don't understand. Well, the time has come to make a decision. lt's a hard one. Blastedly hard. You still have 13 days. Ah, one day is enough. To have pot-shots taken at me and play leapfrog with barrels. No, thank you. In other words, we go back to France tomorrow morning. That would be the most sensible solution. But those confounded cyclotrons will think that Captain Haddock got scared. So, accept the inheritance. Can you see me sailing this ghost ship? Never! Do you remember that sentence in the will? Which sentence? "To my friend Haddock, I bequeath my old boat, "in the hope that he can see the worth of this jewel of the sea.'' Yes. But really, Themistocles, your boat isn't worth two cents! Hm? So what are all these vultures doing circling around this wreck? Yes, I know you must have had something in mind... But meanwhile... I'm all at sea. And you, what would you do in my position? Sail away, hit the high seas, that's all very well! You still have to know which way the wind is blowing ! Yes, I know, it's not good to doubt an old friend. Alright, it's agreed, Themistocles, I accept. I have no idea what's going on, but I'll trust you. Your last wishes shall be respected. Starting tomorrow, I'll engage my crew. Threats or no threats, the Golden Fleece will set sail again. Prepare for the manoeuvre... Watch what you're doing, ectoplasms! Who cursed me with such a crew??! Blasted apparitions of thundering typhoons! Pull that winch, pull that winch for me! Cast off the lashings or we'll run a ground! You're making a mockery of your captain! ...the Golden Fleece. Three knots an hour! And that's with the wind behind us! Attila! Attila! Yefima! Due west. Due west! It's not tricky! Due west? Due west Attila! Attila! Oh please, don't let me interrupt. It's a Turkish game, Captain. It's played with 32 cards. Thundering typhoons! The engine! What about the engine?! Always an excuse, of course! You there will do me the favour of getting upon deck? Go! A real pirate seed! A crew of pill bugs! Bad luck charms! And good-for-nothings! I recruited a real gang of galley slaves. It's fascinating. What I've just discovered is fascinating. He was a colourful character, your friend Captain Paparanic Three shipwrecks. Seven arrests for creating a public disturbance. Eleven rescue medals. He was in Africa, China - a souvenir from Shanghai. He was a boxing champion, but that's not all! Paparanic even saved a republic What are you going on about? See, it's there in black and white - "PAPARANIC, SAVIOUR OF THE REPUBLlC" A motley crew... What on earth did the old freebooter manage to pull off in Tetaragua? Because he was capable of the best as well as the worst. Ah, the soup! I'm starving! The sea air... Popeika, the favourite of our poor Captain. Well spiced, Cuban-style. Cheers, you old pirate. What are you doing here? I don't like to be disturbed while I'm working. Your hands! Hands up, understand? I thought you didn't speek French, Mr. Angorapoulos. That's one little surprise, Mr. Tintin, and there'll be others. No, I never carry a gun. My hands and feet are enough. Bravo, Tintin! A thousand thundering typhoons! What happened here? I found Angorapoulos with his nose in the Captain's papers. He was armed. Legitimate self-defense. lt's still going on, then. Probably a lackey of those gentlemen in lstanbul. Probably... ...we didn't have time to exchange details. Meanwhile, this rascal here can spend the night in the bottom of the hold. When we get to Piraeus he can explain himself to the police. Protozoa! Potato beetle! Troglodyte! We're going to Valparaiso, pom pom pom pom pom. We're going to Valparaiso. - Captain! - What? Angorapoulos has escaped. Escaped? Yes, the shutters of the hold were wide open. Wide open? The lifeboat is gone. Gone? A billion blistering barnacles! Assembly on deck! Aaaaah, we helped this bad luck charm get away - just you wait, my little friends, we'll have the last laugh. Silence! Last night, one of the crew committed a serious crime. We saw fit to put him in the bottom of the hold. This morning he is gone. May the person or persons who helped this scoundrel Angorapoulos get away speak up! I will be magnanimous, but I want the truth. I'm waiting. Right, if that's your last word. Very well, then. Thundering typhoons! From Oslo to Caracas, from Liverpool to Singapore, Captain Haddock has taken down harder men than you, my little lambs! Back to your posts! Gallows birds! Well, then. In my opinion, Captain, we need to look into Captain Paparanic's past to find the answer to the mystery of the Golden Fleece. Yes, meanwhile, tomorrow we drop anchor at Piraeus. At least we'll be able to get rid of those carpets of Mr. Midas Papos. And remember what I told you - if any of you is unfortunte enough to put one foot on land, you'll be hearing from me. Is Mr. Midas Papos in? Regarding...? Tell him it's the captain of the Golden Fleece. Please follow me... Themistocles! Dear Themis... But I don't understand. I was told that... I am the new captain of the Golden Fleece, Mr. Papos. Captain Paparanic is dead. Dead!? Paparanic? But that's impossible! For me he was more than a friend. A brother! An older brother! A hot-headed brute, but such a big heart! Themistocles, my benefactor. When I think of what I was when he picked me up... Everything here, everything, everything I owe to him. And my rugs? My 280 Bursa rugs? Don't worry, they're on board. Ah, perfect, perfect. We shall raise a glass in friendship. Come, come, sit down. Ah, now, what will you have, ouzo, mastika, citronata? Ouzo. Ouzaki. There you are. And for you? No, thank you, I never drink alcohol. Ah, you will do me the pleasure of tasting my little mezedakias. - Thank you. - There. Ah, the little doggy. The little doggy is allowed to have a mezedakia too, isn't he? Ah, poor Themistocles, I just can't believe it. Did you sail together? How we sailed together! For almost 10 years. We really saw some countries, you know. Peru, the Indies, China, Tetaragua! Tetaragua? You were in Tetaragua? Absolutely, I was in Tetaragua. If you can imagine the scene... I see that you're well informed... Ah, what a story! We arrived on a Monday in the heat of a revolution. Tuesday at midday, the Paparanic government was formed. Minister of Commerce, Midas Papos. Eleven days afterwards, we leave Tetaragua like thieves in the night. Like real thieves. Ah, 26 years and many kilos ago... Anton Karabin... Karabin? Karabin, the rich and powerful Karabin. We lost touch. Ah, Captain Paparanic always said... He's still breathing. We have to call a doctor. Yes. A doctor, yes. Oh! The murder weapon! Don't touch it, Captain! Fingerprints! We can explain. This is a coincidence! A terrible coincidence! We'll never be able to explain. What we have to do is save this poor man. Yes. Save him! Quick, quick! Ah, a doctor. We're looking for a doctor. It's urgent - there's not a moment to lose. For heaven's sake, a doctor! A doctor, he's wounded, quick! It's urgent, quick, a doctor! In a dungeon, in a dungeon like common criminals. Captain Haddock has not had his last word! T-I-N-T-I-N. Tintin, reporter. They'll end up making me miss Clodion's cooking. What are you playing at? There were five of them - five adventurers who disembarked in Tetaragua. So? Paparanic is dead. Midas Papos is hardly doing better. Karabin. That leaves the two others. Yes, but meanwhile, according to the Greek police, until proved otherwise, we're murderers. Alas! All appearances are against us, Captain. That's right, make excuses for them. The last dawn of the condemned man. They are above all suspicion! Wait, Captain, it sounds like... To be precise, they are below all suspicion. Either I'm dreaming, or... No, Captain, it's not a dream! Here we are. Thomson and Thompson! It's the first time I've been so pleased to see these two water lilies! So, gentlemen, these are indeed the journalist Tintin and Captain Haddock? It is they! In that case, we sent a cable to Interpol and these gentlemen arrived. They can vouch for you. In addition, Mr. Papos has made a statement establishing your innocence. And his injury? His life is no longer in danger. Move it! Move it, you heap of molluscs! Oh, thundering typhoons! Hang on, l'm coming down! Right, you lumps among lumps! Let's go! Let's go! What, tired already? Hey, what's got into you Siamese twins? It's not Halloween! Shhh, not a word. We're here incognito. Is Tintin on board? No. He went to see how Mr. Papos is doing. Meanwhile, you'll do me the service of removing those disguises of yours. Oh, when I think we got out of jail thanks to these two penguins. Out on bail, Captain. The inquiry has only just begun. Let's see, now. Let's set our watches right. Snowy. Come here quickly, Snowy. Listen, you're going to go and find the Captain. Quick, quick! Go on! Go! What's going on? Angorapoulos... Him again! No, Captain, it's best to just tail him discreetly. Come on! Tintin is right, there's nothing like a good tailing. I have an idea! There they are! Come on, quick! Do you speak French? - Yes, sir. - Follow that car! - Yes, sir May as well toss a coin! That way! They're not far. What do we have here, then? Let's not lose our heads. Park over there. Snowy's got a scent. Don't lose sight of their car! Got it. We'll wait for you in the tavern. Come on, Thom(p)sons. I'm thirsty. Surname, first name and occupation. Yes, sir. No use getting clever. I'm asking you for your details. Yes, sir. Your name! You have a name, no? Yes, sir. Will you leave him alone? This man is a witness. A witness is made to be a witness. Yes, sir. What?... It's a wedding! I love weddings! Come on, come on, come on. A man of his age... To be precise... Snowy! Is that your scent? Right, come on. Ah, Tintin let me introduce Miss Daphne. My friend Tintin. Delighted. Miss Daphna Sirocoupoulis. I'm sorry to spoil the party, Captain... but Angorapoulos is not to be found. They can all go to the devil! Here, taste some of this little local wine for us. You were supposed to be keeping an eye on the car, Captain. Oh, the impatience of youth! You meet friends, share in their happiness and then, bam, you have to run off... Always running off! - Captain! - Yes! - That man playing the clarinet - What about him? His face doesn't mean anything to you? I think I prefer Miss Sirocoupoulis'. I'm sure I'm right. In any case, the photo is in my pocket. - The photo? - Yes. Yes, there's a bit of a family resemblance. It's him, and I'm beginning to understand. Yes, it's him. I'm sure of it. Come on, Captain! Captain! Quick! In the name of thundering typhoons! What timing! A curse on your forebears, sir! Bravo, Snowy. Alright, let's go! Illiterate! Assassins! Torturers! Disembowelers! Hey, the musician is still in the car! Are you hurt? Get your foreign paws off me! The old man can still use his legs. You wouldn't have a little cigarette would you, Admiral? Sorry, comrade. Have to get back to my wedding dance, they're lost without me. It's no small matter to lead the kalamatianos. Hop, hop! Hopa! The men who kidnapped you are capable of anything. I've already forgotten about it. I should explain myself to you, Admiral. I have no memory. Terrible thing, that. Sometimes I even forget my own name. And the Golden Fleece, do you remember the Golden Fleece? The Golden Fleece? Captain Paparanic's boat. He's dead. I inherited his boat. You were in Tetragua, Mr. Scoubidouvitch. You were in Tetragua, Mr. Scoubidouvitch. What happened over there? I have no memory, I tell you. Poor Scoubidouvitch. Any hint that I've opened my trap, that's it! Tomorrow the others come back and bam, bam! No more Scoubidouvitch... When did old Themistocles die? Last month. And his gold? His gold? He can't have taken it with him! His gold? Gold found in Tetaragua? I'll make you an offer. You can take it or leave it. A thousand drachma if you tell us what you know. If only I had any memory, but it's empty in there. Completely empty! Thundering... Wait, Captain. For 1,000 drachma, I can perhaps give you a bit of help. There were four of us in Tetaragua with the Captain. Where did you find that? That's us! That's us, alright! Midas Papos... We've met Mr. Papos. That one is Karabin! Mr. Karabin. We also know Mr. Karabin. Alexander. Alexander Timochenko. And I know where you can find Alexander. He was another first-rate pirate. Now he lives like a saint. Go to Meteora, and ask for Father Alexander. Father Alexander, at the San Stefano monastery. San Stefano, Father Alexander! Which way to San Stefano? You'll guard the motorbike, won't you Snowy? And be good ! Alright, Captain? Fine, fine. What a haven of peace, grandeur and stillness. And we're here to share our pirate stories. Don't forget, Captain that the game is starting to get dangerous. Father Alexander can help us see our way through it. You are right, Tintin, I was philosophising. I bid you welcome to the house of God. We would like to see Father Alexander. I am he. Captain Haddock and my friend, Tintin. Father, Themistocles Paparanic is dead. Oh! God rest his soul. In memory of a small favour I once did for him, he left me his boat. We're here for a specific reason, Father. Since I inherited the Golden Fleece, we have been surrounded by threats, ambushes, attacks. As ye sow, so shall ye reap. It's just that they tried to kill us, Father. Ah, the lure of gain! For a bit of gold, they would kill their own mother and father. What jackals, real jackals! What jackals, real jackals! Once upon a time I was one of them. Yes. I was their friend. Ah, South America, we were sailing on a miserable little cargo ship called the... ...the Santa Maria. And to make fortune we were ready to do anything. Yes, anything! Jackals, I tell you, jackals! Now, as you can see, I live in the shadow of the Lord. I took his helping hand just in time. Ah, I remember. Here's something. When we disembarked at Tetaragua, it was all fire and sword. A revolution. But Paparanic knew how to sniff the wind. He gathered up the shouting street masses and led them in an attack on the house of parliament. And that very evening, the government was us. Oh, I was Minister of War. Minister of War. Forgive me, Lord. As for the rest of the story, eight days later, the guerilleros came, and the five of us had to flee, taking with us just a little bit of gold. Well, what was left in the coffers of the National Bank. And this gold, Father, what became of it? Well, half the spoils for the captain, the rest for the crew. Yes, that's the custom. But this gold will scorch your hands and your heart, believe me. Father, we are not shipwreck robbers. We didn't even know this gold existed. It's just that... that we must stop the others from getting hold of it. Well, then, may the Lord protect you. Paparanic's gold... ...is something he never spoke to me about. No, no, life had separated us, and six months ago, he came to see me. Christmas morning. I was surprised to see him, happy as well. Come with me... A bottle of old pomace brandy. Themistocles' Christmas present. It's funny, when he gave it to me, he said: "You will drink it when I am dead." "It will help you to pray for your old friend." The old infidel. That's it, then. Ah, Themistocles. He was a man. A man. Here, keep it as a memento of him. Thank you. I have renounced those fleeting pleasures. Go now, my friends. Father... Thank you. Thank you. Goodbye, Father. And may heavenly peace be with you. Holy man... Yes, but we haven't really got anywhere. That's right. Come on, Captain. We'll go back down. The bottle! A billion blistering barnacles! Argh! Argh! Captain, come and see, quick! The label! What about the label? A map! Let me see, let me see... Latitude 38, longitude 25. And that duck-shaped cove is the island of Tassika. We passed by it coming from Istanbul. There's a cross, look. A little point near the coast. So? What if, by chance, that was where...? The gold! The gold that the Captain brought back from Tetaragua... So what? That would certainly be the old joker's style. Let's not get carried away, Captain, it's just an idea. Thundering typhoons! But it's obvious! That's it! That's where Themistocles has hidden his gold! We're on our way, Tintin, we're on our way to the treasure island! We're on our way, come on, we're on our way! My dear friend, you must realise that the scientific journey is full of unforeseeable events. Extremely complex research! Eight days and eight nights without leaving my laboratory! But, at the end of my labours, a great discovery - Cuthbertiol! A genius, you say? Let's not exaggerate! Let's just say I do my best to be worthy of my illustrious predecessors - Archimedes, Newton, Thomas Edison, etc, etc, etc. This is an injustice, a judicial error! To be precise, a judicious error! But you will see your motorbike again! Send a telegram telling them to send it to you express post. Calculus! Dear old Cuthbert! Oh, there you are, finally! Ah, I thought you had forgotten me. Oh, there you are, finally! Ah, I thought you had forgotten me. I arrived yesterday as agreed, as soon as my work was finished. We've done it Professor - we know where the treasure's been hiding. Oh, very strong, the coffee is very strong, but very good. What I'm telling you Professor, is that we're on a treasure trail! Treasure, Professor, treasure! This obsession with shouting! You're scaring this poor beast. Ah, we have work to do. Tassika... Right. We're here, we need to get to... Something's up. Come on, Captain! You're crazy! The fuel!... Quick, Captain, close the valve! A billion blistering barnacles! Ostrogoth! Ectoplasm! We only have 200 litres of fuel left to get to Tassika! We need twice that! There's not a moment to lose, he'll sound the alarm. We have to raise anchor straight away. We have to raise anchor straight away. In any case, at the speed this lawn mower goes, Mr Karabin's friends will catch up with us soon. You know, Captain, with two hundred litres of fuel, you can do a lap of the Mediterranean. -A lap of the Mediterranean? -Yes. On the condition that you add a few tablets of Super Cuthbertiol! Super Cuthbertiol? I promised you I'd solve the boat problem - it's done. Thanks to Cuthbertiol, the motive force, and thus the propulsion, is multiplied by 1 00. But you can't seriously be trying to tell us that... Three tablets, Captain, three tablets. What do you think? In our position... You're right. To hell with it, let's go! -We have 99 chances of exploding... -What?! And one of... What does this flying scarab beetle want from us? It moved! It moved! Who moved? There's gold beneath my feet. Are you sure you're not mistaken, Professor? No, no, it's gold, gold. -Gold! -Gold! We're going to Tetaragua... Hunt down the gold! To your posts! Gold, gold, gold, gold... We're going to Tetaragua... -I think it would be better to wait. -No, no, no. Take the dinghy down to the point and go around the boat. Go! Take the dinghy down to the point and go around the boat. Go! If anything's not right, give a sharp tug. OK, Captain. We're with you all the way. And watch out for mermaids, alright? Now, now, Snowy, do you see me worried? There he is. There he is, there he is! I found the gold! I'm going back down to tie up the chest. Bravo, Tintin. Come back quickly! Pass me the rope! Ah, a billion blistering barnacles. The Tetaraguan gold. Everyone, hands up! Thundering typhoons! The bashi-bazouks! I said, "Hands up!" And I say clear the decks for battle! Come and get me! Mercenaries! Web-footed sea birds! Ah, my little lambs, we'll play a game of Mutiny on the Bounty! Watch me crush you like mosquitoes! Spider Monkeys! Anacoluthons! Zapotecs! Iconoclasts! Haddocks have been hanging mutineers from the main-mast since the time of my ancestor the Knight of Haddock! Oh, the spivs! Oh, the baboons! You'll pay for this. It's gold... ! You'll go to the galleys. Trap me like a lobster! Just you wait! Trap me like a lobster! Just you wait! Mr Karabin! I made it my personal duty to be here for the end of this adventure! I made it my personal duty to be here for the end of this adventure! Unfortunately, Mr Tintin, it ends very badly for you! Assassins! Assassins! Assassins! The Captain will go down with his ship. Tradition - and prudence - demands it. We never liked each other much, Themistocles, and yet you see - I'm the one who will have the most beautiful memory of you. -Are you coming, Thompson? -Let's go, Thomson. Help! Help! Swim, swim, breathe... Legs, use your legs... The stick, use the stick... Hello, Mr Karabin. How?... You? Very pleased to see you again too, Mr Karabin! Land this plane or you're a dead man. Give me a hug, Snowy, you saved our lives! Thundering... Snowy's on fire! Snowy's on fire! Ouch! Snowy's on fire! Water, water, water! Water, water, water! Water, water! Attila! Inspector Attila Thai, of the Turkish police. -What? -I'll explain later. -What? -I'll explain later. What about Tintin? Up there, with Karabin. Up there, with Karabin. Mr Tintin, Paparanic's gold won't be mine, or yours, or anyone's. -Captain Haddock? -Yes? You were right. You were right. 2,400 metres down, a deep-sea trench, the gold is irretrievable. Oh, never mind about the gold, Oh, never mind about the gold, we've had a chance to see a few places and meet some nice people. Inspector Attila. I've often wanted to ask you, were you one of those bashi-bazouks? Or just a waffle-iron? It's still moving, it's still moving! Gold! Still gold! Again? We told you, it's 2,400 metres down. Ah, a man of science makes no mistake regarding this sort of oscillation. Really, there aren't thirty thousand treasures of Themistocles! Wait! Wait! Wait for what? What if the old chest I fished out wasn't THE treasure? What if the old chest I fished out wasn't THE treasure? Not the treasure? Captain Paparanic was a trickster. He liked to throw out red herrings. Captain Paparanic was a trickster. He liked to throw out red herrings. So? Do you remember the sentence in the will - Do you remember the sentence in the will - "To my friend Haddock, I bequeath my old boat to my friend Haddock, "To my friend Haddock, I bequeath my old boat to my friend Haddock, "in the hope that he can see the worth of this jewel of the sea." What now... The proof, there's the gold! What was in the chest was only old bits of ship railing. No! I am not mad! Nor is my pendulum! It's gold! Nor is my pendulum! It's gold! Gold? If I understand you correctly, then, Karabin's treasure was only copper! If I understand you correctly, then, Karabin's treasure was only copper! Maybe... Copper! Copper! Copper! Copper! Gold! Gold! It's everywhere! Copper! -Copper! Copper! Copper! -Gold! Gold! Gold! Up lads and at 'em! Everyone on deck! Ah, it's you, Mr Postman, you scared me. I was dreaming that a band of pirates wanted to take over my hammock. No, I just have some mail for you, Captain. No, I just have some mail for you, Captain. For me? A telegram and a parcel. From the Americas. From the Americas. The Americas! Some news, Captain? Some news, Captain? If it's another inheritance, burn it! President of Tetaragua to Captain Haddock. Nation thanks Captain Haddock for returning gold. STOP. Tetaraguan Parliament renaming Victory Square. STOP. Tetaraguan Parliament renaming Victory Square. STOP. Victory Square now Themistocles Paparanic Square. Bravo! Bravo! Unanimous government vote to give Grand Cordon of the Order of the Scarlet Cheetah to brave Captain Haddock. STOP. The Grand Cordon of the Cheetah. Oh, it's too beautiful. It's much too beautiful. Oh, it's too beautiful. It's much too beautiful. Captain Haddock terribly moved. STOP. What's that? An idea of mine. An idea of mine. It's too much! It's much too much! Captain. Captain. Where there's a ceremony, there's a brass marching band! Where there's a ceremony, there's a brass marching band! And champagne! To Tetaragua! To dear old Themistocles. To dear old Themistocles. Oh, thank you, my friends. Gentlemen, my latest invention. To stop our winged friends from being nostalgic for the big blue sky, the flying birdcage. Voila! That's it, that's it...
