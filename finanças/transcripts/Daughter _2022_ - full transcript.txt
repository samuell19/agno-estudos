Family is the most important thing in this life. You know that, right? Right. You know why that had to happen, right? Right. Then you know you could've prevented it, right? Right. So you'll try harder next time? Right. Alright. It's alright. Settle down. I want you to understand something. I don't want to hurt you. I don't want any harm to come to you at all. But if it comes to it, you will be harmed. Do you understand? This could be the safest place you've ever been. If you let it. Or... you will die. You don't want that, do you? Good. Neither do I. Nothing in there but water. Please, just let me go. Let me tell you how it works in here. We're not violent people. You'll be safe as long as you are safe. Nobody's going to touch you. Not in a sexual way. I promise you. Your name is Daughter. You can respond to Sister when it's appropriate. I won't tell anyone. I promise I won't, please. -Daughter. Daughter, listen to me now. Listen to me. You are safe here. But you're not gonna leave this place. Not for a while. It's okay. Listen to me. The truth is I need you. I need your help with something. And it took me a long time to find you. Please. This won't be easy for you, I know. I know I'm asking a lot for you. And things won't be like they were before. I'm sorry about that. I am. But I can't do this without you. In a couple of years, he'll be all alone. And I want these last few years to be special. And after that, all of this... All of it can end. You can go home, and you'll be safe. Unharmed, you understand? It will take some time to know each other first. But a decision will need to be made pretty soon. Boy, I told you not yet. Nobody here wants to hurt you. Nobody, okay? I'll let you think about things for a while. I hope you make the right choice. Are you trying to get sick? Easy there. You're okay. Just thought you might be hungry. There's somebody I want you to meet. This is your mother. We had you 20 years ago, but we tell your brother it was 18 years ago. Because you're too old to be here now, but we still need you around for a couple of years. Two more years with him. And then you can leave unharmed. That's it. That's all we ask. Could be fun if you let it. I'll let you two get acquainted. You're very pretty. Do you like eggs and toast? You don't have to be afraid of us. I know that'll be a hard thing to hear for a while. I'm here to help. However I can. I just want to go home. I know. And we'll do everything we can to make sure it's comfortable here for you. We want you to be happy here. Please, just let me go home. I won't tell anybody. I promise. Please just help me. This is going to be home for a while. You have to understand that. You don't have to be sad here. You don't have to feel trapped or be tied up all the time like this. You're part of the family now. And we just want to love you. Please. No. And we want you to love us. If you're happy, it'll be easier. On all of us. It'll be okay in the end. As long as you do as he says. You'll be safe here. Safer than you've ever been. Why are you doing this? Because we're family now. Family is the most important thing in this life. And families stick together. For better or worse. Was that your son? Mm-hmm. Now... how about some breakfast? Yes. Maybe. But not for very long, though, huh? There's a cost. Out there. A heavy cost. The soul is immortal and everlasting. And uncorruptable if you protect it well enough. The world in all its glory will pass. Most of it already has. The rest will extinguish one day. One day soon. And all its corruption and rot along with it. But the soul continues forever. If it's corrupted... If it's damned... It's damned forever. That's the cost. You understand? They traded the essence of their existence to a temporary plane. Now they're paying the price. But we can help them, right? There has to be other people like us. Everybody can't be sick, right? The diseases out there don't play by the rules in here, son. There are no rules out there. That's why it got so bad. "The finite is nothing if not a transition into the infinite." Man's purpose is to surpass the limits of life. This home... is our finite. If we make it safe in here, then... this is like the world for us. A world we gained. But to let people suffer... We knew that we could've helped. That has to be bad for our souls. So what does our world matter if we gain while others suffer? You know what? I think you're on to something. That's it for today. Go on and play. We'll save the rest for tomorrow. Is Sister okay? Can I play with her soon? We have to be sure she's not still sick. We need to be careful. When she's ready. This is just to hold you in place. Then I can let the other ones go, okay? We'll get you there. I have to learn to trust you first. Trust takes time. You know that. And hopefully by then, you'll trust that I am a man of my word. And I hope that you've been listening to what I've been telling you. There we go. Now, see? That's better, isn't it? What do you say? Thank you. My pleasure. See? It will get better here. But there's a couple things you need to understand. Everything I do, I do to protect that boy in there. He's special. And right now he needs his family. His whole family. What can I do? How you behave over the next couple of week determines what happens next. How the rest of your time here will be spent. It's entirely up to you. Show me that I can trust you. Okay. School starts now. Know all of it. Trust it. Then we can talk about what comes next. Smile. Rise and shine. You finished? I think so. You ready to behave? He's dying to meet you. If you're ready. I'm ready. The rot stays out there. I know. I want to help. I will help. I'm very glad to hear that. How do I play? I can't say how happy I am to be here with the people I love. Today is a big day for all of us. We finally have our beloved daughter back with us. It fills me with joy to know that our family is whole again. We are all going to do a better job this time. To keep you safe. Make sure you don't get sick again. Thank you. Will you try your best, too? Yes. Alright then. Welcome back, Daughter. -Would you like some help? -If you'd like. Could you grab that one? What's with the whispering? You know I don't like that. Just making sure she knows she's been doing a great job. It's so nice to be together again. That can be said in front of the family, don't you think? Yes, of course. My mistake. And you, Daughter? Anything to say? No, sir. Just happy. I don't like secrets. Secrets in a place like this are dangerous. Families rely on trust. We're not gonna have an issue with trust, are we? No, sir. Good. I hope not. And please... call me Father. Everything okay? Yeah, I'm having fun. -Is this all you do for fun? -No, but... Father says it's good for you to take things slow here. And why does he say that? Because of the air. And the games help you get more comfortable. What happens... when I'm comfortable? What do you mean? What am I getting comfortable for? To move in, silly. I miss having my sister around. So, I hope you'll stay. I don't like when it's just me, but... father says that's just a part of life. -What is? -Being alone. I've had a lot of sisters, and I'm always alone until they come back. Mother thinks you'll be here awhile. I hope you can move in soon. And then what? And then we can have more fun. It's your turn. No, the other one. Right. Sorry. "And so man left it up to the future to justify its present existence. Thus, its existence was never justified. The present was corrupted and the future left unattainable. They toiled away, and they rotted one generation after the next. Blinded by the delusion that their sins would never catch up with them." Why? How'd they let that happen? Daughter? They act irrationally. And it gets them in trouble. They act out of a desire to possess something that isn't theirs. Yes. "You desire and do not have, so you murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and you quarrel." "You do not have because you do not ask. You ask and don't receive because you ask wrongly to spend it on your passions." Very good. And sometimes it's malicious. Why do you say that? Because it's true. People poison each other with lies. And deception. Bad faith. False realities. You think there's a cosmic order out there to what's true and what isn't? There exists such a thing as objective truth. That's enough for today, go play. I need to have a word with your sister. But I don't understand the lesson. There's no lesson. Your sister was joking. A funny joke. Oh. Go on! Story time later. Don't you poison that boy. Don't you forget what I told you about your time here. I'm just trying to contribute. You're trying to be a smart-ass. We don't tear pages out here. False pages are mistakes. We learn from our mistakes. Wear them like badges of honor. Lest we make them again. Understand? So don't let me find any missing pages in there. Do you understand me? Understood. So how do we learn from today's mistake? What is happening here? Why is no one allowed to leave this house? The outside is toxic. It's much safer here. It is true. That's insane. Now... finish your dinner and come listen to a good bedtime story. "Remus wanted the city to be on top of Aventine Hill, but Romulus preferred Palatine Hill. And when Romulus started building, Remus got angry. Because, you see, to settle their argument, Remus and Romulus sought counsel from the gods. And would be delivered in augury. Birds would be examined to see which brother the gods favored more. Remus was the first to see six birds and took that sign as the gods' will. But Romulus later saw twelve and assumed greater favor. So he started to build on Palatine Hill even though his brother's sign came first. And in Remus's jealousy, he mocked his brother, who toiled away to build his city. Romulus, angered by his brother's belittlement, decided to kill him. And so, his city was completed." Hey. I couldn't sleep. -Something wrong? -No. I just can't sleep sometimes. My sister usually tells me a bedtime story when I can't sleep. I'm sorry. I don't think I know any. What kind of... What kind do you want to hear? I want something that can help me tell my own. What do you mean? I want to tell a story like Father's. They're so good. I never know what'll happen next. How can I come up with anything like that? Well... He has a lot of... help. Inspiration... I mean. From the world. You mean he knows a lot about the world? Sort of. But what if I don't know enough? I'm sure you know plenty. Like... what about the air outside? -What about it? Well, it makes people sick. Right? -Yeah. So how do you know? I just know. Okay. If you had to explain it to someone or tell a story about it, how would you? This is too hard. I didn't mean to wake you. I'm sorry. Tomorrow I'll help you find a story, okay? Okay. -Goodnight. -Night. Father and Mother tell the best stories for my birthday and I want them to really, really like mine. I like when father tells stories because he gets up and he moves around and he makes everything big and loud and... sometimes he does voices. Like this. Like a play. We can make ours a play. But it's for story time, not for playtime. A play. Like what Father does. Only ours will be better. And more fun. We could say the words to the story out loud. We could dress up as the characters. We could even make our own costumes. You know? Pretend. Pretend to be stories? The characters. The people in the stories. It sounds dangerous. What if we get stuck like them? We won't. I promise. Okay. But we have to ask Father first. This is very irregular. This is very irregular. It sounds dangerous. We'll be very careful. -This is what you want? -Sister says it will be a lot of fun. Danger is not fun. Please? Like Sister said, we'll be very, very careful. I'll think about it. Daughter. I'm counting on you. And then you say... Here. "One of us will be Miss..." And then turn to the audience. "Kentucky." And smile. And then I say, "I found this new girl from the country." I have a question. Yeah? What's Kentucky? Nowhere you'd like to go. It's somewhere outside? Yeah. Are there sick people there? Mostly, but this is not about them. Don't worry. I won't be any good at this. Sure you will. I can't even think of anything to help, but... you're doing all the work. -No. Not all of it. Want to know a secret? That you can't tell Mother and Father? Sometimes... a story already exists, but... it's not good enough, so you make it better by changing what's bad about it. Someone else thought of this story first. But... it was dangerous. It hurt people. So... I'm making it better. And you're helping me. Because that's what brothers and sisters do. Now, we're going to have fun. Just like what Father does. He doesn't make it all up, you know? He takes what's there and changes it. Understand? It'll be okay. I promise. I take it you two had a good day? We're telling a fun story about a soldier and a girl who... -No. Don't. Sorry. It's just... it's a surprise. We want it to be a surprise when you hear it. So it'll be more fun. So... not until your birthday. I forgot. I'm sorry. It's okay. It's about a soldier? What do you know about soldiers? It's a story that we're changing. To make it better, so that it's fun. It's not about anything like fighting. It's a safe story. A safe story. You know how... How you change your stories to make them better. What's that now? It's an old storytelling trick, right? Is there something you'd like to share with us? Something you know about my stories that I don't know. No, si... Father. We just want to put on a good show. Rise and shine. That was fast. We're not done yet. I'm just going to the bathroom. Go on then. Come back here when you're finished. We're done here. What is this for? This is for your protection. You know that. I'll be back in a few hours. And everything will go back to normal. -Would you like to paint with me? -No. I'm okay. Why does he take your blood? He's just testing the air. Probably means it's almost my birthday. Does he do it every year? Only sometimes. He says there's an interval. But I don't know what an interval is. Does he ever take mine? Of course not. Have you ever been outside? Only to stop the sickness from spreading. But I don't like doing that. Please don't make me go outside again. -Okay. I won't. Promise. A little more, please. You've outdone yourself this time. -Sister helped. -Did she? That's what I like to hear. What about you, kiddo? -I made a new painting today. You did? You'll have to show me after dinner. How's the air? You were testing it, right? That's right. And I'm happy to report it's improving. Believe it or not. Like I predicted. By the time your birthday rolls around next year, you might be able to go help some good souls like you wanted. Assuming we can find any. What does that mean? "Do not forget to do good and help others for with such sacrifices, the soul cleansed." You heard the man. What was the blood for? What's that old saying? "Curiosity killed the cat." Sorry. I was just wondering if there was a way I could help. I'm just joking around. After all, there's... a cause for great happiness today. I told you your brother here was special. There's never been anybody like him. The blood that flows through him will save all of us one day. That's why the world seeks to corrupt it so. But soon... He'll be ready. You just keep being a good sister to him. You're helping him more than you know. I promise you that. Alright, lights out. What's all this? -We're finishing our story. The big mystery. Well, time for bed. But we're almost done. It's really fun and requires lots of energy. I think you'll really like it. A couple more minutes. Father. Is there anything we can use to... put the finishing touches on it? Like... a device. Or a machine. To make it look more formal? Not by hand. We wouldn't use it for anything else, of course. Just writing. If there is such a thing... I mean. You know what. I may just have the thing you're... you're talking about. Maybe I'll dig it up in the morning. Y'all get some rest now. Goodnight, Father. Goodnight, Son. Daughter. Goodnight, Father. Testing her limits. I knew this would happen again. She's too old. She's a bad influence on him. He's happy with her. She's been a great sister to him. You too? Of course not. I just want a happy family. I want a safe family. Then let them have this. If she's happy, she'll stay. And if he's happy... then you've been a wonderful father. I appreciate you, you know? The effort you're putting in this time. Things keep up... you'll be off punishment soon. How does it work? Oh. That'll make it go faster. And now all we have to do is finish typing up the final version and it'll be ready in time to practice for your birthday. Want to see whose hands are faster? Okay, sure. How do we do that? I have an idea. HELP I HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED KATHERINE HUYNH FOLLOW THE PAINTING! What are you doing? I couldn't sleep. I just wanted to take a look at your painting again. It's really good. I just want to make him proud. I want to do a good job and do what I'm supposed to do. What are you supposed to do? Can I show you something? But promise not to tell father. He doesn't know that I know. Of course. He says that one day when the time is right... my blood can save the world. I think this is what he was talking about. How will you know when it's time? He hasn't told me yet. The truth is man bargains. Sells himself. Corrupts himself. All for a finite world that will never exist the way it does in our dreams. That's what made them poison each other. Poison the air. That's what got them all sick. They thought for a sustainable means to an end, but what it really meant was a quicker end. That's why we work every dayto surpass the limits of life. You're the infinite, Son. One day, you'll show them. Daughter. Daughter. Daughter. Now, how about that birthday story? The heat is on in Kentucky The heat is on in Kentucky The heat is on in Kentucky The heat is on in Kentucky WELCOME TO KENTUCKY It's okay. It's okay. It's okay, I've got you. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. -No, no, no, no. She's not sick. -No! She's not sick. No! No, please, don't do this. Don't hurt my sister. No. I don't want another sister. Please! My name is Sylvie. You need to run! Mother! Father! Son. You okay? See, the door's closed. You're safe. I'm sorry. You're safe. Get ready to go. We can still save him, but we need to go soon. Listen to me! I'm sorry. It's okay, hey. I'm sorry for what I did. I was wrong. I was angry. I apologize. But you don't understand what's happening right now. You don't. Alright? We need to leave. All of us. It's not safe here anymore. You win. I'll get what I deserve. But please... For the boy. Help me. Just because you can breathe out there, doesn't mean he can. I didn't mean to... I didn't want to do that, I... He went outside. Those are the rules. He was sick. I couldn't breathe, I... I couldn't breathe. I didn't want to. I'm sorry, I didn't... It's okay. I promise. You trust me, right? And you know I'd never hurt you. Right? See? It's safe. Whenever you're ready... you can try, too. But only when you're comfortable. Okay? Everything's going to be fine. I promise. I'm going to call for help. I'll be right back.
