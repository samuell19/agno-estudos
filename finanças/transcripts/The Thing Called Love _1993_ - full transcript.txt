WELCOME TO NASHVILLE. IN JUST A FEW MINUTES, WE'LL BEGIN BOARDING OUR 4:45 DEPARTURE FOR NEW YORK CITY. HOWDY. HOW YOU DOING? APPLICATIONS AND PENCILS ARE ON THE BAR. DON'T STEAL THE PENCILS. HURRY IT UP. DOORS CLOSE AT 4:05. ANYONE NOT INSIDE AT 4:05 DOESN'T AUDITION. WHEN I CALL YOUR NAME, I WANT YOU TO COME UP ON STAGE. IF IT'S YOUR FIRST TIME, I THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT IF YOU DON'T PASS, IT JUST MEANS I DON'T THINK YOU'RE READY. GO HOME AND KEEP ON WRITING AND COME ON BACK AGAIN. YOU'RE GOING TO TRY OUT FOR WRITER'S NIGHT? YEAH. I'M A WRITER MYSELF. I HAD A TOP 20 HIT LAST YEAR. YOUNG WRITERS ALWAYS HATE IT WHEN I TELL THEM THAT. I TELL THEM, LIVE FOR THE MOMENT. DON'T GET A PICTURE OF WHEN YOU HIT 'CAUSE YOU AIN'T NEVER GOING TO BE IN THAT PICTURE. ONE, TWO, UN, DEUX, TROIS. THIS IS IT. * SAYIN' GOODBYE * DOESN'T MATTER WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE ON THE OUTSIDE. IT'S WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE THAT COUNTS. THANKS. WHAT TIME IS IT? 4:15. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. YOU'RE HERE WITH ME. I CHANGED A FLAT TIRE FOR YOU, WHICH IS WHY I'M LATE. * FIND MY SHOE, CHERIE * JAMES, YOU KNOW THE RULES--4:05. I JUST STOPPED TO FIX THIS GIRL'S FLAT TIRE. THAT WAS REALLY NICE OF YOU. YOU ARE A REGULAR GOOD SAMARITAN. NEXT TIME, LET THE CAB DRIVER CHANGE HIS OWN TIRE, AND YOU GET HERE ON TIME. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER BREAKING ONE OF THOSE RULES SOMETIMES. IT MIGHT BE LIBERATING, IF NOTHING ELSE. HEY, I DON'T KNOW HIM. THAT TIRE THING WAS HIS IDEA. I JUST CAME HERE FROM THE BUS STATION, ALL THE WAY FROM NEW YORK. LOOK, I KNOW I'M LATE, BUT I REALLY DID SUFFER TO GET HERE. WHAT WAS YOUR NAME, HONEY? MIRANDA PRESLEY... NO RELATION. WELL, MIRANDA PRESLEY, NO RELATION, THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN TELL ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM ABOUT SUFFERING. THERE'S ANOTHER AUDITION NEXT WEEK. HEY! I DON'T APPRECIATE YOU INCLUDING ME IN YOUR LIE BACK THERE, ESPECIALLY WITHOUT ASKING ME. WELL, THAT'S A FINE POINT TO MAKE. THANK YOU. O.K. THERE MIGHT BE A SONG IN THAT. HUH? I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU OUT FOR A BEER, BUT I'VE SINCE CHANGED MY MIND. WHAT IS THAT, SOME KIND OF LINE? YES. DOES IT WORK? SOMETIMES. RARELY. I'LL BET. I MIGHT CHANGE MY MIND AGAIN. MAYBE YOU SHOULD CHANGE YOUR LINE. THAT'LL BE $20. I'LL PAY FOR THE WHOLE WEEK. OH, THAT WON'T WORK. WELL, THE STRIP IS SHOT. THE CARD'S GOOD. YOU CAN CALL IT IN IF YOU WANT. NO NEED FOR THAT.

THERE'S THIS TRADITION WHEN YOU FIRST GET TO NASHVILLE WHERE YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE TALLEST MOUNTAIN OR THE TOP OF A BUILDING AND YELL, "LOOK OUT, MUSIC CITY, 'CAUSE I'M HERE AND I AIN'T NEVER LEAVIN'!" THAT'S REAL NICE. I WASN'T SURE THAT SONG WAS ANY GOOD UNTIL I HEARD YOU SING IT TONIGHT. OH, KYLE, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL SONG. WILL YOU DO THE DEMO FOR ME, BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE ANYBODY ELSE?

TO BE HONEST, UM, I'M NOT PARTICULARLY FOND OF HOSPITALS MYSELF. THE TRUTH IS... MY DAD WENT INTO AN EMERGENCY ROOM, AND I NEVER SAW HIM AGAIN. THAT'S HIM. HE LOOKS JUST LIKE ELVIS. HE'S THE OTHER ONE WHO DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ELVIS. OH. HE GAVE THIS TO ME WHEN I WAS 10. "MY DECITENNIAL ACCOLADE," HE CALLED IT. HE HAD A NAME FOR EVERYTHING. HE RAISED ME SINCE I WAS 5... JUST ME AND HIM. SO WHERE WAS YOUR MOM THROUGH ALL THIS? UH, SHE SPLIT... PRETTY EARLY ON. PRESLEY'S MY MIDDLE NAME. HE HAD THIS THING-- MY DAD--ABOUT ELVIS. NOTHING WEIRD. HE ALWAYS WANTED TO TAKE ME TO GRACELAND... BUT WE NEVER MADE IT. COME ON. THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT TO DO. WHERE WE GOING, BABY? NOW, DON'T DO IT 'CAUSE KYLE, THAT PSEUDO HICK, TOLD YOU TO.

WELL, YOUR SONG IS A NOVELTY SONG, AND MAYBE YOU NEED TO DIG IN A LITTLE DEEPER. LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING. YOU KNOW WHAT'S IN HERE? THESE ARE ALL REALLY GREAT SONGS THAT WERE SUNG HERE FIRST. THEY'RE NOT ALL HITS, BUT THEY'RE REALLY SPECIAL SONGS. SOME OF 'EM TOOK 10 MINUTES, SOME TOOK 10 YEARS, BUT EVERY ONE OF THESE WRITERS FOUND A WAY TO SAY SOMETHING THAT MEANT SOMETHING TO 'EM.

I'M TIRED OF DOING WHAT EVERYBODY WANTS ME TO. GOOD IDEA. DON'T GET IT CUT. WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK ME WHAT I THOUGHT ABOUT YOU MOVING OUT OF THE MOTEL? WHY DOESN'T ANYBODY EVER ASK ME WHAT I THINK? BECAUSE YOU'RE ALWAYS ASKING EVERYONE ELSE WHAT THEY THINK. THAT'S RIGHT, AND YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M NOT DOING IT ANYMORE. IF I DON'T FEEL LIKE BEING NICE TO SOMEBODY, THEN I'M GOING TO START BEING MEAN-- OR IMPOLITE. IF I FEEL LIKE TELLING SOMEBODY WHAT I THINK, I'M GOING TO TELL THEM. AND BILLY THINKS WE'RE GETTING MARRIED BECAUSE HE WANTS TO? WELL, I'M SORRY, BUT I GOT TO BE SOMETHING MYSELF BEFORE I CAN BE SOMEBODY'S WIFE. THAT'S RIGHT. OH, SHUT UP, PLEASE. BUT I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I CAN BE BECAUSE I'VE NEVER BEEN ANYTHING. AND YOU-- YOU'RE NOT SO MUCH BETTER THAN ME. YOUR DADDY'S BEEN DEAD OVER A YEAR, AND YOU STILL CAN'T SLEEP THROUGH THE NIGHT.

NO ONE HAS EVER DONE THAT BEFORE WITH ME. AND I APPRECIATE IT. I RESPECT YOU. MY FATHER... I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M TELLING YOU THIS. I'VE NEVER TOLD ANYONE, BUT MY FATHER WOULD TELL MY MOTHER THAT WE WERE GOING OUT FOR A BOYS' NIGHT OUT ON THE TOWN. AND WE WOULD GO TO HIS GIRLFRIEND'S HOUSE-- MY FIFTH GRADE HEALTH TEACHER-- AND I'D GO WAIT IN THE TRUCK LISTENING TO THE RADIO STATIONS, AND HE WAS INSIDE, YOU KNOW, DOING WHATEVER IT WAS THEY DID, AND I JUST REMEMBER ALL THOSE CHEATIN' SONGS... HOW IT MADE PERFECT SENSE. MOST EVERYONE... BACK IN WIMBERLY... SAYS THAT-- THAT I'M GOING TO BE JUST LIKE MY FATHER. NOW... HERE'S THE KING. THEY'RE WRONG. * WISE MEN SAY * YOU HEAR THAT?

GOT A BETTER IDEA. WHAT? LET'S GET MARRIED. Y-YOU DON'T JUST GET MARRIED AS A JOKE. IT'S NOT A JOKE. IT'S A JOURNEY, LIKE THE OLD IRISH TRIAL MARRIAGES. WHAT OLD IRISH TRIAL MARRIAGES? WELL, IN ANCIENT IRELAND, THERE WAS ONE DAY WHERE YOU COULD GET MARRIED FOR A YEAR-- ARE YOU MAKING THIS UP? NO, I DON'T THINK SO. ANYHOW, YOU WOULD GET MARRIED, AND IF YOU WANTED TO SEPARATE, YOU'D GO BACK TO THE PLACE YOU GOT MARRIED AND RESOUND, "I DIVORCE YOU, I DIVORCE YOU, I DIVORCE YOU." WHAT DO YOU THINK? OH, MY GOD.

AM I TO TAKE CARE OF YOU, MYSELF, MY MUSIC? TAKE CARE OF ME? YOUR TROUBLES. MY--MY TROUBLES? IS THIS IT? WHAT TROUBLES WOULD THOSE BE? WHAT, THE FACT THAT I'M YOUR WIFE AND YOU'RE SPLITTING TOWN FOR TWO MONTHS AND YOU DON'T EVEN ASK ME TO GO? IS THAT THE TROUBLES YOU'RE SPEAKING OF? MAYBE I'M NOT THE MARRYING TYPE IF MARRIAGE IS THIS. IF YOU'RE SO SCARED OF TURNING OUT LIKE YOUR FATHER, YOU BETTER TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT YOURSELF. ARE YOU DRUNK? AM I...WHAT? AM I DRUNK? WHY? WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT? BECAUSE YOUR MOTHER HAD TO GET DRUNK TO DEAL WITH YOUR FATHER? YOU KNOW, YOU ACT SO INTENSE, SO CALM, SO COOL AND COLLECTED. THE TRUTH IS, YOU'RE SO FUCKING SCARED.
