Do you want to do it with me"? "Your thing feels so good. Ah, I see". Yo! What are you looking at? - Are you gay? - Me, gay? I once saw a foreign gay like you. "A sobbing, mysterious woman". Hey, you! Enough is enough. What are you doing? It's nothing. - You going to watch it again? - Is there a problem with that? Not a problem, but is it really that fun? Fun? Certainly not! It is heavily edited, you see. All the important scenes have been removed. It's unfortunate. - So, why watch it again? - Why?! Maybe because I am sexually frustrated. I'm always like that. The more I watch it, the more I want it. Get lost, you idiot! Hey, wait! If you stop me one more time, I will beat you up! Okay, okay, I understood. I am leaving. Bye bye! {\i1}She had such a treacherous and bold body.{\i0} {\i1}I fell asleep while thinking of her seductive body.{\i0} {\i1}In the dark seat, I imagined what kind of pleasure,{\i0} {\i1}or crime the explosion would be.{\i0} {\i1}The extensive novel that I have to write...{\i0} {\i1}the theme I chose is sex.{\i0} {\i1}No, that's not it.{\i0} {\i1}All the themes in the current literature scene...{\i0} {\i1}follow the dominant trend called sex.{\i0} {\i1}If I have to use it for myself…{\i0} I got a call from the Sumire Group. Hey! Come on, sit here. You see, this gal over here... She might not be the best-looking girl, but she is a kind one. What do you think? This is nothing like you promised me. What I wanted was a mysterious girl like Michiyo Aratama. She's not like that at all! - Mysterious? - That's right! This one looks like a monster! - Sorry for being a monster! - Calm down. You see, all the girls are out currently, because today is not only Saturday but also salarymen’s pay day. Now, now, I will do it better next time. Hey, go back and wait for calls. Come on, don't be like this. - Don't be upset. - Bastard! Let me see her off. Wait a second! My bad, my bad, I'm genuinely sorry. I made a big mistake just now. I am deeply sorry for harming your beautiful skin. I would like to give you a proper apology. - Why don't we have a cup of tea? - It's okay. I want to show that I didn't have bad intentions. Otherwise, I will keep thinking about this. But... Uhm... I am Yamamoto. I am still a student, but I will go to the US next year to help my father... with his business. Anyway, let's go! {\i1}This call girl is such a strong-minded one.{\i0} {\i1}She strictly follows the laws of desire to maintain her livelihood.{\i0} {\i1}Prostitution Prohibition Law?{\i0} {\i1}Prostitution only exists because there is a thing called Law.{\i0} {\i1}As a writer, when I see this form of desire that exists in our society,{\i0} {\i1}I feel as if I have discovered a gold mine.{\i0} Finally, it's only the two of us! The neon signs are beautiful! I have fallen in love since I saw you for the first time. I am serious! This is called love at first sight, isn't it? Please believe me, I am serious. I love you! I've fallen in love with you! - I can go anywhere with you. - What are you doing? - I can even die with you. - Let me go! It’s the truth! Please believe me. I can't do this! Let’s travel together next spring. - Please, stop! - Let’s go to New York. I want you to meet my father. He is in Japan right now. I can't do that... I am serious, it's fine! You can do it, can’t you? I am going to touch you, that's all. A little, a little touch. Just a little! A little! - Stop. - Ah, your underwear... It's on the way. I am going to take it off a little. Just wait a moment! Hey... - Not here... - Huh? Let's go over there. What you said earlier... Is it true? It sure is. - Hey, come here a second. - Yes? - Do you want a girl? - Huh? Do you want to fuck a girl? Huh? I will give you a chance to fuck a girl. Mister, enough with the jokes. - Do you want it or not? - Well... I want to do it always, but right now... There is a girl for you on the back, follow me. Hey, come with me! She is my girl and I already got sick of her. Would you do her? - That's why you brought me here? - Right. Very well. I would definitely do her. - Stay put! - Huh? Wait! Who are you? You are being rude! - You like it, don’t you? - No, I don’t! If you want to do it, at least pay me. You fool! I have no money. Doing it for free is rude. Pay me already! - No can do. - Give me money now! I will pay you later. What are you talking about? Pay me now! What are you doing? 5.000 yen would do. Come on, hurry up. - Give me money. - I'm already in the middle of it. No, stop! Boo! What? Was it you? You surprised me! Did you want someone else? Don’t talk like that, come in. - I'm coming in. - Please do. - Sit here. - Thanks. - Want a drink? - If you don't mind, yes. The air conditioning in this room is really bad. That's right! It's like hell during summer. - Have you been fine? - Yeah. - Bottoms up! - Cheers! Do you need anything? - Yes, it's about Hiramatsu... - Hiramatsu? He has to write a graduation essay, right? That's why I am here. Apparently, he needs your help, Itami. Huh? My help? What is it? What is he doing? What is the theme? “Forms of Sex in the 20th Century". Do you think the lab will even allow it? His major is Social Psychology, right? Well, the lab people believe in him... I wonder about that. And he said he would combine sociology... with sex in the introduction. Hm, Hiramatsu is doing that... I wasn't expecting he would. So, what kind of help does he need? Apparently, the collection of data has been completed. There was a lot of data and statistics, but I think it's not enough. The essay has not progressed at all. I think he is very confused nowadays. In my opinion, he lacks more internal necessity... to choose this assignment. Oh, internal necessity, huh? For that purpose, he has added data to create an original logic. And now he is confused in terms of creativity. Well, you might not be as familiar with the topic as I am, Itami, but... you have a good reputation among classmates. Reputation, you say? What kind of reputation is it? You are a professional at behavioral sex. Me, a pro? No way! Well, the word “pro” might not be important, but 80% of female students in the Faculty of Literature have slept with you. It is an undeniable fact! That was in my freshman year, wasn't it? Oh? So, does that mean you have an even bigger territory now? Well, I'm only talking about... the theoretical side of it, but you do admit... your assignment is researching about behavior in sex, don't you? Well, it is not just an assignment. I just want to know more about various forms of sex in our life in general. Hiramatsu’s essay is the opposite. In his essay, sex is an extension of an intellectual being. Really now? So, what is his opinion... about the more regular forms of sex present in our life? What do you mean? In other words, when you two are having sex. There is nothing unusual about our sexual pattern. It is nothing but a way to entertain ourselves, just like a hobby. The only thing that concludes our relationship is love, though. He sure is old-fashioned. {\i1}Love is nothing but an artificial creation, like the existence of God.{\i0} {\i1}Sex is all about consumption,{\i0} {\i1}but it's not something that is supposed to be done casually, like peeing.{\i0} {\i1}There surely is a philosophy behind consumption.{\i0} - Huh? What happened? - A blackout. I will teach you through your body, and you will inform Hiramatsu about it. Of course. With you, this is the only way. Wait a moment. Let me undress myself. Hey, are you a sadist? I am normal. Do you like sadists? I have seen enough sadists in novels. When you describe sadists, you need something... that transcends the words "normal" and "abnormal". What do you mean? Sadists have nothing abnormal in them, at all. In other words, all human beings want to memorize their own thoughts in clearer forms. Therefore, the feeling of a sadist about his behavior during sex... is nothing but creating another emotionless self... who wants to memorize what he himself is doing. I picked up a call girl earlier. I didn't necessarily want to have sex with her, though. Did you pay her? No, I literally picked her up. I made her come up to a rooftop for a beer and had sex with her. Really? So, It's not like I wanted to have sex with her. I just wanted to know how the so-called pro, who you talked about earlier, would react to that, but the only thing that happened was sex. {\i1}I am not that interested in sex.{\i0} {\i1}Me neither.{\i0} {\i1}I can understand the true nature of human beings...{\i0} {\i1}by observing how the other partner reacts during sex.{\i0} {\i1}Really?{\i0} {\i1}I have never felt that sex...{\i0} {\i1}had a deep relation with humanity.{\i0} {\i1}We can only become true human beings during sex.{\i0} {\i1}All day, every hour...{\i0} {\i1}Every hour, I only think about sex.{\i0} {\i1}But I always think about something else during sex.{\i0} {\i1}Maybe I understand nothing about sex.{\i0} {\i1}Sex is not something you understand.{\i0} {\i1}As we can't understand other people's experiences,{\i0} {\i1}we have to feel them in person. Otherwise, it can't be considered sex.{\i0} When did you arrive? Not long ago. But you seemed really into sex. By the way, I think she already told you. Currently, my graduation essay is not going well. I have collected historical theories about sex, as well as various kinds of data about them... But it proved impossible... to create an essay about sex in the 20th century based on those. So, I ended up formulating a hypothesis in my head. The difference between modern-day sex and future sex... But I am not sure if there is any generational difference in sex itself. I cannot understand sex from the data alone. Don't touch her! That's why I need you to teach me. Just go away and watch! Damn! I am being serious here! Shut up. You are not listening to me at all! I am listening. And I'm teaching you right now. She is my girlfriend in the first place! That's why I am teaching you, right now! How dare you?! You are taking my own girlfriend! - Damn you! - Hey, easy! Calm down! You little shit! Is he okay? Don't worry about him. He just fainted. Huh? Hey! Hey, Hiramatsu! Hey! Hey! He is dead. - Hey, come here a second. - Huh? Give me a hand. - Let's put him there. - Over here? Grab his legs. This guy sure is heavy! Hey. We have to do something about this. - We cannot have a funeral. - Where is his hometown? He told me it is a little town north from Nagano. His only family member is his mother. So, he always had a strong case of mother complex. - Do you have money? - Yes. - Let's go get lunch. - Okay. - You are very calm. - Huh? Have you ever killed anyone before? I have killed a lot of girls metaphorically. Do you think we can make it look like a suicide? Who would kill himself in this way? We could use a car! Throw a closet over him. I am not sure it will hit his head in the right place. Put him on the railway. More specifically, place his head on the railway. There are things called vital reactions. They can find out right away if the body died before or after the collision. Do you remember what happened with that one controversial murder case? Why don't we just throw him against a wall, like a black cat? In that case, I would have to lift him up this high to achieve that in my house. Seicho Matsumoto would first cut him into pieces in one of his novels. Right, and then he would throw away his head in Sapporo, his arms in Nagano, a half of the body in Fukushima, the other half of the body in Hamamatsu, his left leg in Shiga and his right one in Fukuoka. But a clever newspaper writer would definitely find out the truth. We wouldn't be able to run away. I read about grinding the body into powder and giving it to goldfish. That's a great method, but it's too naïve for modern-day murders. I guess we're hopeless. There is no way. You weren't expecting I'd have sex with you multiple times last night, right? That's right. It's just as I thought. How was our first sex? And after Hiramatsu showed up, he was basically offered as a sacrifice to your pleasure. Stop it! That was the outcome, wasn't it? Your sexual desire wanted this. It needed your boyfriend's death. What kind of sex have you had with him so far? You frigid bitch! No... No... No... I am going to kill the dangerous girl inside you! I'll kill her! No. Stop! No! “Japan has finally conducted a nuclear bomb experiment”. Huh? - You have a car, don't you? - Yes. I do have it. Let me smoke it. - Such an impressive place. - Yes. What do we do now? We still have the other half of the vacation. I have to write my novel. And I also have to find a part-time job. Do you want to go to the beach? My sister reserved a vacation home. - Apparently, she doesn't use it. - Really? At least, it will be better than Tokyo. {\i1}Is this really a beach?{\i0} {\i1}It's somehow lame and dirty. When can I feel the scale of nature?{\i0} {\i1}Until we enter our grave,{\i0} {\i1}being supervised and watched by yakuza and guards{\i0} {\i1}is nothing but a nightmare we will continue to have.{\i0} {\i1}Girls.{\i0} {\i1}Human beings are the only animals who have destroyed their own sex.{\i0} {\i1}Looking at women who have never thought...{\i0} {\i1}they would be watched by someone like me.{\i0} {\i1}I fancy that kind of thought.{\i0} {\i1}And while I maintain some distance,{\i0} {\i1}I also try to simultaneously approach them.{\i0} {\i1}In reality, such a thing is impossible but in films, for example,{\i0} {\i1}you can achieve that effect when you use a zoom camera.{\i0} {\i1}That remote yet proximate composition revitalizes my desire.{\i0} {\i1}Women might not realize it at all,{\i0} {\i1}but they are already being raped by me in my imagination.{\i0} {\i1}And I love watching the girls’ expressions from that vantage point.{\i0} {\i1}However, unfortunately, there's this thing called privacy,{\i0} {\i1}so I have to be more careful nowadays.{\i0} {\i1}The reason why I have to look at their eyes is because...{\i0} {\i1}the eyes have their soul and personality.{\i0} {\i1}But this thing called privacy is like the skin of a scallion.{\i0} {\i1}Every home has its own privacy.{\i0} {\i1}Wives have their secrets hidden at home.{\i0} {\i1}Every single individual is concealing their own secrets from others.{\i0} {\i1}This makes me think about why personality and ego exist.{\i0} {\i1}Can we consider the body to have any personality?{\i0} {\i1}Come to think of it,{\i0} {\i1}it's like the body is voluntarily exposing itself to me.{\i0} {\i1}The bodily dynamite is what blows up our personality and ego.{\i0} {\i1}Human beings enforce restrictions on their upper and lower parts like that,{\i0} {\i1}but the risk of explosion persists.{\i0} {\i1}My countless love affairs...{\i0} {\i1}are nothing but traces after a huge explosion...{\i0} {\i1}of high-voltage charges received from all these girls.{\i0} {\i1}My preference and methods have been established this way.{\i0} {\i1}In the real world, I cannot use a zoom lens to have love affairs, though.{\i0} {\i1}She must be over thirty or something, but what the hell is she doing here?{\i0} What is she doing here? That bitch! What kind of job do you do? Well, I only started my job last year, you see. - So, I don't know much about it. - I see! I make a list of bad places for juveniles, and tell mothers to prevent their kids from visiting those places. Well, I sometimes even use the police's help. Really? There's also a campaign called, “Don't Show, Don't Read, Don't Sell". - We call it the "three don't" campaign. - I see, I see. This way, both TV shows and movies... should be reviewed by us. You make a list and notify the public, right? Indeed! If there are many problematic issues, we force the publishers, censorship boards, and the Film Classification and Rating Organization to shut them down. That's a kind of a political activity, isn't it? That's right. It's the proper way of political activity. It sounds like such a rewarding job indeed. What an amazing job! Maybe so, but it's extremely hard. Yes, I bet it is! But I wish younger girls payed more attention to social issues, or gradually, it will be too late for them. That's exactly right! In that sense, you are certainly one of the most sophisticated women of this age. People usually tell me that. But it's the truth! By the way, how do you think the situation in the US and Europe is? I bet there must be a lot to learn from them. I'm planning to travel around foreign countries next spring. My university major is Social Psychology. Oh my! Well, I don’t really want to travel, but my lab said that I had to do that for my career, so I don't have much of a choice. Young people have so many good opportunities! But you are still young, Madam! Oh, no! I am not young anymore. No way! Have you ever worn a miniskirt, Madam? Not really. Why don't you wear it? You would look good in it. But it's too short, you see? But you want to try it, don't you? Would you give it a try? - A try? - Yes. - What are you doing? - I am giving it a try! - Let's see how you look in a miniskirt! - People will stare at us! Wait! You're such a bad boy! When you walk like this in public, you feel stimulated and liberated. You feel liberated, don’t you? It's here. Ah, please come in! Ah, let me introduce her. This is Madam Kimura from the Jonan Wives’ Association. This is Kinuko, my younger sister. It's a pleasure to meet you. Uhm, he told me his major was Social Psychology, and I came here to get some help in that field. Bring us cold beverages later. Wait a moment. Please wait! No... don't be so rough! - More... be more gentle! - Gentle my ass! Hey, be more tender, okay? Are you kidding me? Why would I be tender to an old hag like you? Old hag! Listen, old hag, dirty old bitches like you make this world crazy. Let’s calm down. The world is collapsing because of you. - Horny women like you... - Listen to me. Okay? - Like to do crazy things! - Let's calm down! Quiet, be quiet. She will hear us! More... please be gentler... Be gentler, will you? I'm asking you... Kiss me, will you? Let's forget about what happened today, okay? Here you go! Sorry to take so long. Well... uhm... you didn't have to. Here you have. Brother, were you helpful? I guess. Yes... uhm... I sure learned a lot of things about Social Psychology. She is not my younger sister. She is my girlfriend! Your acting was so good! How rude! Who are you, anyway? Who are we?! Aren't you even embarrassed, you horny old hag? It was obscene, you old bitch! That's enough! I am leaving now! Bye bye! Stop. I don't want to show it to anyone until it is done. Do not even try to take a peek. You were trying to show it to me, weren't you? - Not really. - I don't think so. You know my habits. You are being mean. Oh stop, I'm exhausted. How was it with that old hag? - Come on! - Hey. - Hey. - Give me a break! Hey, tell me. What did you do with that arrogant woman? You already know it, don't you? So what? Come on, don't you want to do it? Nope! - It's freaking hot! - Hey... Come on! {\i1}For example, it took several hours...{\i0} {\i1}to seduce yesterday's horny old bitch.{\i0} {\i1}I wonder how can I shorten those several hours?{\i0} {\i1}In other words, the old bitch already had...{\i0} {\i1}that specific personality in her subconscious mind.{\i0} {\i1}That's one of the possibilities.{\i0} {\i1}I want to capture those hidden personalities{\i0} {\i1}through this phenomenon,{\i0} {\i1}from day to night, from night to day.{\i0} {\i1}To master this kind of trick at once...{\i0} {\i1}I have to change my method.{\i0} {\i1}Kinuko thinks that our relationship is strange.{\i0} {\i1}However, if she comes into my life more deeply,{\i0} {\i1}our relationship will collapse and I won't forgive her.{\i0} I want to fuck her! Over there, there! She just came out of the water. - That unique swimsuit. - That's right, that's right! It's her! I want to fuck a girl. I don't care whoever it is! She has an attractive body! She does, right? - I would definitely fuck her. - You bet I would! She is coming this way! She's really hot! {\i1}I decided to leave because I had something else to do.{\i0} She's the best! What are you doing? Let me go! Hey, shut her up! Be quiet, bitch! Hey, mister, can you speed up? I can't, they enforce the speed limit very strictly. Please do something! My wife is being raped by some men. What did you just say? Why didn't you tell me earlier? Those scumbags... Alright! Is this alright? Won't you call the police? - It's okay, there's no need. - Huh? They are all going to do her. Oh, here's another one! It's not going to be over. I am leaving. It's time to move! 200 yen, please. - Here. - Okay. This is ridiculous! How was her taste, huh? What you did was nothing but peeing a little, that's all. Move away. Good evening. {\i1}The relationship between men and women...{\i0} {\i1}No, the structure of sex between men and women usually has two extremes,{\i0} {\i1}raping and being raped,{\i0} {\i1}liking and being liked,{\i0} {\i1}loving and being loved in return.{\i0} {\i1}In other words, the relationship...{\i0} {\i1}between men and women about sex in general,{\i0} {\i1}such as that of the attacker and the victim,{\i0} {\i1}is nothing but a conceptual structure.{\i0} {\i1}I wasn't just watching Kinuko being raped earlier,{\i0} {\i1}I was visually comparing her...{\i0} {\i1}with my ex-girlfriends,{\i0} {\i1}and thinking about her physical reactions to sex,{\i0} {\i1}but also the forms of my sexual desire, and the flow of my mind.{\i0} {\i1}In other words, the concept of women's passive sex{\i0} {\i1}was being destroyed within me.{\i0} {\i1}Herself, no...{\i0} {\i1}I, myself, have thought like this for a long time.{\i0} {\i1}The animal-like or plant-like characteristics of sex.{\i0} {\i1}Attacking is sadism,{\i0} {\i1}being attacked could be considered as masochism.{\i0} {\i1}In conclusion, I clearly understood that sex,{\i0} {\i1}which is one of human being's animal-like characteristics,{\i0} {\i1}had an explosive power.{\i0} {\i1}My own experience with numerous women,{\i0} {\i1}meeting Kinuko for the first time,{\i0} {\i1}and the death of Hiramatsu, Kinuko’s boyfriend...{\i0} {\i1}What all those experiences have taught me is that...{\i0} {\i1}the true face of humanity is related to sex,{\i0} {\i1}and that the true face of sex is nothing but an energy of death...{\i0} {\pos(960,124)\i1}Sex... Love...{\i0} {\pos(960,124)\i1}Sex... Love...{\i0} {\i1}which is trying to destroy every single piece of human being's extensive history.{\i0} {\pos(960,124)\i1}Sex... Love...{\i0} {\i1}Sex... Love...{\i0} I think I finally understand myself. I just didn't know what sex was until now. Many things have happened, but I think I have finally become a sexual person. I'm sure I am a sexual person. Enough is enough. In this world, everyone is a sexual person, am I not right? Everyone is a bundle of sexual desires, that's how we are. But you called me a frigid bitch before. - Oh, I did! - It means I wasn't sexual. The rape corrected it, that's all there is to it. Stop overreacting! {\i1}I have fallen in love with Itami.{\i0} It's ready. I finished it! - What happened? - I am leaving. Right now? But it’s been only five days. I will go back and tell the police that I killed Hiramatsu. I think I have fallen in love with you. So, I think I can go back to normal if I turn myself in, and correct the distortion in my past. Normal? It's too late now. You are being stupid. You are the one who is stupid. Do whatever you want to do. I will still stay here. THE END
