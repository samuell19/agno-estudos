? ? ? ? ? ? ? It's all coming together. I can smell it. Well, your senses are more attuned than mine. It still just smells like dirt to me. You don't love the scent of the garden? It reminds me of my grandmother's house. It reminds me of the baseball diamond when I was a kid. Five years, never once managed a hit beyond first base. Oh, I booked a Michelin-star chef to come teach the kids a few dishes next week. And how much is that going to cost? Oh, no, I paid in gratitude and the promise of good press. ght, I will be back Now, later in the week.y of. It's looking amazing. Bye, Marcus. Marcus: Bye. ? They paved paradise, put up a parking lot ? ? Oh, la-la-la ? ? Oh, la... ? Hi. Hi. How are was it at the community garden? It is so gorgeous. Still a little rough, though, but give it two more months, we're gonna have tomatoes as big as our hands. I love it there. I want to live in a treehouse above the place. Tea? (phone ringing) Hi, this is Hayley Hammond. Hi, Hayley, this is Sasha Raymond from Zen Forward. Hi, Sasha, it's so nice to hear from you. I'm thrilled to let you know Growing Out is a finalist for our quarter-million dollar grant. Oh, Sasha, thank you so much. We are so thrilled. Good. My assistant will reach out in the morning and we'll set up the first meeting for the last stage. Looking forward to it. Just send your eligibility form and we'll be good to go. Already on it. Yes, I see we have most of them. We're just waiting for the office requirement. A permitted office space? Yes, we will take care of that right away. Wonderful. Talk soon! Talk soon. Bye. (both laughing) We don't have a permit. What about that person you know over at the mayor's office? I still think they're gonna tell us it's gonna take a few weeks. We need something faster. Come on, Doug. You know there's no better home for your charity dollars than right here. You're helping kids, it's a no brainer. You've always been my rock, Doug, and we could really use the boost heading into Q3. Great. Great, thanks. I'll have Lucy draw up the paperwork, and let's set up a basketball game for next week. Okay. Thanks. Throw that one on the street. We have no room for it. It's our contacts from Kids in Coding. Fine. Scan everything and burn it. (sighing) I miss our big office with a view of the river. Well, since they're imploding it this week, the view should be outstanding. Nowhere to sit, though. Oh, can you set up a basketball game for me and Doug Purcell next week? Why? You hate basketball. I like it. I'm just terrible at it. Which means it's a good opportunity for our donor to feel like a winner. Always thinking. Always. Not helping. I will help you. Thank you. ? We can't possibly need an office space. Marcus works full-time at the farm and Pete is always out with the kids. A shared office space. Where it's loud and full of people all the time. No, they have enclosed offices. We'll just have to commit for a few months. We can handle that. My dating history says otherwise. Hey, can you check to see if the tea strainer is in the pile of stuff in the hall closet? Mm-hm. Thanks. Did you find it? No, but I did find this box of letters. Really? (laughing) Oh, this must have been left from the previous owners. No, these aren't my letters. What are they? They're love letters. ? In a way I know my heart is waking up ? ? As all the walls come tumbling down ? Hayley: "I find I can think of nothing but you, sweet Mari." Should we really be reading this? This is someone's innermost feelings. This Marisol left them here, Hayley. They couldn't have meant that much to her. Or she was just trying to get over him, and they clearly mattered more to him, whoever the "Techie Poet" is. No. No. If he didn't even sign his real name, he forfeits his rights to them. Okay. "Because the truth is, with you I'm at my best. I want to be the shiniest version of myself. I find I stand up straighter, act kinder, believe in people more." He's a little over the top, don't you think? No, he's perfect. Keep reading. "I think a lot about the day when we met and how everything went so perfectly, like it was meant to be. If I could go back in time today, way before we met, I'd search and find you right away to form our loving duet." He rhymes. He's rhyming. He's rhyming. He is a poet. He's so passionate. So passionate. ? I can feel you breathe ? Where is this place? Elisa: Should be right up by Cypress. Oh, I found it. Okay, you're sure this is Sasha's Raymond's thing? 100%, but rhubarb and boysenberry only. Got it. Bye. Hi, there. I am here looking for a few flavors that come highly recommended. Rhubarb and boysenberry? Sure. I only have a couple of each today. How many would you like? I'll take all of them. I'll wrap those up. Hi! I'm looking for rhubarb jam? I'm sorry, I just sold all my jars to this young woman. Hi, I don't know how many you bought, but I'd be very appreciative if I could grab two off you. (chuckling) Well, she only has two of them. Could I possibly trouble you to switch to another variety? I'd be happy to pay for yours. Oh, well, ordinarily, I would say yes, but I really do need these today. So do I. My sister is having a really bad week and it's the only thing that makes her feel better. Rhubarb jam? Childhood favorite. Rhubarb is medicinal. Not many people know that. She's sick and it's the only thing that helps. Is she sick or is she having a bad week? Both? Well, I sincerely hope that she feels better. I really do need that jam. Do you even have a sister? No, but I wasn't lying about the rest. Why don't you just tell the jam lady that you need some for tomorrow and she'll make you some tonight? Have a nice day, sir. (sighing) Hi, again. What's your next most popular flavor? Apricot and blackberry. A couple of each, please. Got it. Thanks so much. Really? Listen to this part. "I've never thought of love as magic, and I don't know. Love isn't rare. It doesn't mask the bad parts of the world. It changes the light around them, makes you see what's truly important." But can you still make your deadline when you are lost in someone else's love story? It does not say that. No, I know, but we need to get this paperwork done at the workshare by five in order for us to get this grant. Fine. ? I promise that you'll never find another like me ? ? I know that I'm a handful baby, uh ? ? I know I never think before I jump ? ? And you're the kind of guy that ladies want ? Hayley: Paperwork! ? I know that I'm a psycho on the phone ? ? I never leave well enough alone ? ? And trouble's gonna follow where I go ? ? And there's a lot of cool chicks out there ? ? But one of these things is not like the others ? ? Like a rainbow with all of the colors ? ? Baby doll, when it comes to a lover ? ? I promise that you'll never find another like me ? $800 a month still seems steep. Not if we get the grant. And if we don't? I don't understand those words. Hayley Hammond? Nathan. Hi. This is my business partner, Elisa Barr. I understand you run a non-profit. Yeah, we do. We get inner city kids out into the wilds of nature and expose them to gardening and sports and all sorts of things. The messier the better. I love it. Come and let me show you where you'll be. Great. Oh, no. What? The woman over there, I might have tried to hustle her out of some jam yesterday. Excuse me? Well, I tried to get the rhubarb stuff you suggested but she'd bought all of it. So, I might have lied to her to try and get her to sell it to me. Oh, hey there, new office-sharer. Sorry I lied to your face, but I'm really a great guy when jam politics aren't involved. Josh: Maybe if I just... The wall is glass. Hayley: How's your sister doing? Much better, thank you. She's expected to make a full imaginary recovery. My thoughts are with her during this very tough time. How's the jam? It was a gift. And you couldn't have found another gift and let me have that one? And you couldn't have told me the truth in your effort to convince me? Fair enough. Josh Burns, by the way. Hayley Hammond. Have you been working here a while? About a week. Our super cool loft office got sold to a developer and is being pulverized to dust as we speak. Ah, the ballad of the big city. Well, my partner, Elisa, and I we're also here for the foreseeable future too. Cool. Well, if you need anything in your cube, pod-- Dungeon? Right. Just let me know. I will. Yeah, okay. Well, it's nice to actually, finally meet you, Josh. You, too. ? Elisa, you hopeless romantic. "I know you're away for work until next week, but I keep having to stop myself from buying you little things. Techie Poet: "Your favorite smoothie, "a cookie from the bakery down the block. "You're a part of me, one I feel almost like a muscle." He's sappy, but the guy is definitely sweet. Man: Saw your dad out the other day. He's looking great. You'd never know he had a heart attack less than six months ago, that's for sure. He asked if I could introduce you to anyone nice. Some things never change. Did he really say "nice?" That doesn't sound like him. His exact words were, "Do you know any appropriate girls for Joshua?" See, that sounds like him. I promise, I didn't tell him about the fantastic women you refuse to let me set you up with. Thank you. He seems to see my singlehood as some sort of outstanding transaction. It wouldn't hurt to get out there again. I've just got Mainframe up and running. I don't have time for personal relationships. This is the third non-profit you've started in the ten years since we graduated. It's not a new thing. If you don't find time, it won't magically appear. Who says I need anything more? I'm just saying, you can't marry your job. Maybe I'll get married, maybe I won't, but I'm more concerned with being happy than trying to fulfill someone else's idea of perfection. But are you happy? You really have been talking to my dad. (laughing) Hah! They got you too! Did anything juicy happen? They hiked Machu Picchu, they talked about having babies, they even looked at houses outside the city, but it's so depressing. Why? How do we know they didn't end up together? Read. "I love seeing you in the ring. I remember my grandmother packing it away and thinking it was sweet..." Techie Poet: "But not understanding the importance of it all. Not until I saw it on your hand." See? What? They got engaged. The engagement obviously meant more to him. Our poor boyfriend's gonna have his heart broken. A, you don't know that and B, now we have equal ownership over this romance? Yes, yes. I am totally hooked. Well, keep reading. I want to know what happens next. Can we do it tomorrow? I want to at least think that they ended up together just for a few more hours. Maybe they did. Maybe they bought one of those houses and that's why the woman sold the condo. Do you think she would've left these letters here if this had a happy ending? You have got to be kidding me. So, that explains the rhubarb jam. Why didn't you tell me why you needed it when you met me the first time? Would you have given it to me if I had? Absolutely not. I didn't think so. I know you from somewhere. Did you do that Ted X about communing with nature? Yes, I did, and I take it you're more of an indoor guy? I run and play sports, but, yeah, I'm a techie, so the sun kind of gets in the way of me playing on my tablet. Oh, the pesky sun, providing so much vitamin D and electricity. Josh and Hayley. Both: Hey. I'm Sasha Raymond. Hi. Nice to meet you, Sasha. Nice to meet you. So nice to meet you. You know each other? Um. Oh, well, Hayley is the co-founder of Growing Out, which takes city kiddos outside to experience farms and fresh air, and Josh is the head of Mainframe, which takes kids and gives them the opportunity to work and play with the latest tech. Mm-hm. Let's go inside and get to know each other better. Great. Josh: So, really, we've been pushing beyond the standard practice of "homework on the tablet" for kids. It's pretty limiting. Interesting. What are your thoughts on that, Hayley? Well, I can give you thirty different opinions on fertilizer or how children needing sunshine to help calibrate their eyes, but I don't really know a lot about technology and kids. Alright, well, that answers my questions for now. Although, I know I'll have a million of them pop up soon enough. I want this to be a simple process. You both have until Friday to put together a full visual proposal, and then we will assemble here, the five of us, and explore your non-profit's futures together. I hope to fund pretty quickly after that. Mainframe is beyond excited to be in the mix. Zen Forward is such an industry leader, it'd be great synergy. Well, I'm looking forward to it. It is incredible that a tech company is looking to preserve these fundamental parts of our humanity. Of course. We love what you do. Alright, I guess we will put together a proposal time. We very much look forward to seeing you again very soon. Thank you. Thank you so much. And by the way, I really appreciate the gifts from both of you. I guess my addiction to Mary Ann's Jams is known far and wide. (both chuckling) Alright, um, you headed back to the office? We could share a car. I really don't think we should be fraternizing with the competition. I understand why you might be worried, but I'm not. I'm not worried. Oh, and I meant to tell you. Sasha, she hates apricots and she's allergic to blackberries. (sighing) Of course she is. And really, synergy? Yes, synergy, and you? Kids needing their eyes calibrated? What is that? It's true. You should look it up. See you back at the cube. Okay, we need to hit the ground running with this pitch. Set up a time with Marcus and the kids. Thursday is a farm field trip, so maybe we can tag along. Although, I think that's gonna be too late for the turnaround. (sniffling) Part of me desperately wants to know what happens to the Poet and the other part knows that we need to set everything up immediately. It's so sad! Oh. Oh, honey. What is? Read it! "How have you evaporated from my life without a trace? Techie Poet: I call and you don't answer. You always answer. I was worried enough to stop by your condo, but you never answered the door. You know I'm not the one to barge right in. Hey. So, I was thinking, given the situation-- Elisa, this is Josh Burns. He belongs to the office five yards that way, and he so happens to be our competition for the Zen Forward grant. Oh, wow, um, hi. Did I come at a bad time? No, but knocking is generally appreciated. Right. Sorry. (knocking) (chuckling) So given the situation... Oh, I was going to suggest no spying. Because we're going to win the grant. Mainframe wins most of what we go after. Well, that's because you've never competed against us before. We don't lose, either. So, no spying? We wouldn't. We don't need to. Great! Nice to meet you, Elisa. (laughing) (water trickling) I hear you're pitching at Zen Forward. Patty Sullivan's on the board, I could put in a good word for you. Mm, a good word, sure, but no more than that. We're doing quite well on our own. I know you are. I'm not trying to interfere, I just want to help. Oh, then can you lend me some of the seeds from your lavender garden? There's this little girl, the program director said she wants to use them to help her make this fancy lemonade she saw on YouTube. Aw, done. I'll bring them over the next time I see you. So, tomorrow? You know, you say that like it's a bad thing. No, not at all. It's just we're two single ladies in a big city, alone. (laughing) You know, we have to stick together. Well, there's three of us, including Elisa. Three. How is she? How's she doing? How does she like her new apartment? It's Elisa. She doesn't really talk about stuff like that. You know, everything is fine, she can manage. She doesn't need help. I slipped her doorman a 20 and a coffee cake just to keep a special eye on her. I can't imagine what you would do if I had a doorman. And about that, why are you still living in a walk-up? It's what I can afford. And I am proud of how hard I worked to get it. And for the millionth time, it's in a great neighborhood. Well, if I can't interfere in your work life and your home life, I'm just going to have to start stalking your love life. Okay, great, we can discuss my love life, which basically consists of me living vicariously through other people's love lives. Which reminds me, what is this I'm hearing about you and the guy who runs the butcher shop downtown? Mom! Oh! (laughing) But why aren't you dating? What about that guy that was doing the morning show? Oh, he worked really weird hours. It was hard to make plans. You're never going to meet anyone if you keep inventing problems. Okay, it wasn't the hours. There just wasn't enough there to justify working around them. And sometimes, you have to give people a chance to make it worth the effort. No, I give plenty of people plenty of chances. I'm just... I'm not into anyone right now. And that's what concerns me. Everything concerns you. You think my windows are too thin. You know, it's perfectly natural to still feel heartbreak after a year. I know, but I'm over Daniel. I am. It does get better, especially when the real thing comes along. You are worse than Elisa! And your windows do need to be replaced with double-paned. (laughing) Okay! Can we just go back to talking about the very good-looking butcher? since Dad passed.15 years I want you to be happy. So, if you meet a good-looking guy that's nice, I want to hear about it. ? Hayley: I thought you had a date. I did, but he's a dog-walker. He had to leave by 8 to, you know, walk all the dogs. Oh! You took the letters! What? Oh, I have the last couple. I thought you were allergic to dogs. Well, they're not his dogs, so... The last two. It's short. "I saw your brother at the movie theater the other night. "He came over and gave me a hug, said he was sorry for what happened." Techie Poet: "But what did happen? "If I've caused you some unknowing pain, "I want so badly to fix it. And if not, I just want to know." It is crazy, right? Who would do that? Who would do this? ? Video: And that's how we'll break the chains of poverty. Have you seen the promo video for last year's grant recipient? Yeah, it's unbelievable. We don't have anything like that. How much design money is left? Five grand or so. Do you want to call Devin Flores and check and see if he's free? Yes! See if he can meet for lunch tomorrow. What happened to last year's grant recipient? Why aren't they in the running? They were fully funded by a few Fortune 500s. Ten million or so. Okay, maybe we can find a little more money for graphics. Right. We have to mail it back to him, both for sentimental reasons and because I'm pretty sure that it cost a lot of money. And then, he'll fall in love with your wit and charm, and you'll meet right here in real life, under a gently falling rain. 'l latst sight, primedyo words. Okay, or he'll just say "thank you so much" and we'll never speak again because, you know, he's like a total stranger. After all of this, you don't believe in love? After all of this, you still do? Besides, I am already ahead of you. What did you say? I asked if he wanted it back. (giggling) ? Hayley: Dear Techie Poet. You don't know me. I'm the proud new owner of Marisol Yvonne's former condo, and I'm quite embarrassed to let you know that I have found your letters, and what I assume was a very special gift you'd like returned to you. I have no way of knowing if you still live here, or even that you've truly parted ways with Marisol. Nothing would make me happier than knowing the two of you have run away together. If you'd like the letters and gift back, please let me know. Signed, Your Granola Fairy Godmother. The type of graphics you're talking about aren't cheap. On this time frame, I'll need to bring an animator in to take the more intensive code. I get that, but cheap doesn't win grants. I want the best animations we can get, within reason. Okay. Is everything okay, man? I've never seen you this worried about a pitch. Oh, everything's fine. Thank you, though. Just, there's some other things going on, which is why I really want to nail this proposal. Do you have an animator you trust? Uh, yeah, yeah. Here. No animation. Have you seen the video last year's winners put out? I did, and they're working on food-supply chains to third-world countries, their graphics make sense. But we deal with children - grassroot, organic efforts. I want them on screen as much as possible. Do we know a videographer? I don't think a photographer's going to be enough. I'll get on the phone. Okay, I'm going to head down to the mayor's office and see if I can get anyone on camera willing to vouch for us. Good luck. You got this. I got this! How's the pitch coming? Nearly done. Hmm, are you trying to intimidate me? Are you intimidated? No such luck. No spying! I'm not. You think this girl found your grandmother's engagement ring? Marisol wasn't big into gifts, so I can't imagine what else it could be. You're going to ask for it back, right? Of course. But honestly, I can't believe she left it in the condo when she moved. Who does that? It's taken you nearly a year to get over her, Josh. Don't-don't let this drag you back down. I just don't want to think about her. I want to take the non-profit, turn it into a juggernaut, and forget she ever existed. Except that's not who you are. Maybe it would be easier if I knew what happened. Ghosting me after three years? It really messed with my head. Unless this Granola Fairy woman also found un-mailed letters from Marisol, explaining in detail what went wrong and why she ran away, you're never going to get the kind of closure that you want. Write this woman back. Let her return your family ring. Put Marisol behind you. Easier said than done. One more game? (groaning) I should head home. Same time next week? You got it. (sighing) ? Well, that was fast. (phone ringing) Elisa: Are you alive? Because if you are, it's too early to be calling me. I am, and it's after 10 a.m., so you should be awake. I was up till three. There's a letter from the poet guy. I'll be across the street in two minutes. Wait, no. This needs croissants. Meet me downstairs in five. Fifteen. Ten. Deal! (squealing) "Hello, my Fairy Godmother! "What an unexpected letter to receive. "I fear you have me at something of a disadvantage. "It seems you know so much about me and I know nothing about you." Reading his words again, he sounds like a runaway from a Victorian-era drama. (laughing) Shh, you're ruining it! I'm hoping your letter means you've found my grandmother's engagement ring. A solitaire, which is all I really know about those kinds of things. The letters, you can keep. Burn them in a ceremony, write a Broadway musical, whatever you like. They belong to a different version of this poet. But the ring, well, I would appreciate that back. Your ever-grateful Techie Poet. Oh, my goodness, the ring, it was his grandmother's? You have to fall in love with this man and heal his heart. Or maybe he's already moved on. Maybe he's with someone else, or maybe he's even become a monk. I'm telling you, this is fate. Okay, slow your roll, Scarlett O'Hara. We're just gonna get the ring back to the poor guy, and that is all I am signing up for. (giggling) I have to go. Are you sure you don't want to go to the movies with me and Candace? You know I love a reason to escape, but I have errands to run. You're adulting too hard for a Saturday. Hmm, possibly. Tell Candace I say hi. Will do. (typing) Following 400 celebs, followed by three bots. Techie Poet: "The crux of the issue as I see it "is that humanity is largely blind." Oh, it's so you! (beeping) Hayley: Hey there. This is kind of a long shot, but would you happen to be the Techie Poet of Marisol lore? Well, hello. What are the workforce challenges we'll face in the next 15 years? Automation, AI. Our workers need to be prepared. You're talking about children. Kids are capable of so much more than we give them credit for. Their imaginations can manifest things that we, as adults, can't even fathom. And the best way to help them is to give them the tools they need to create. Fair point, I guess. I've done a thing. You know the Techie Poet guy? As much as I know him not at all, yes. You've been writing him. I'm pretty sure that I haven't been. Well, I have, but as you. It seems our friend has a hidden little Twitter account. And so do you now! "Hey there. This is kind of a long shot, but would you happen to be the Techie Poet of Marisol lore?" "You found me! Clever! Not so truly analog, are we?" "Says the Techie Poet who wrote his girlfriend via snail mail." You have been writing him this whole day? He's charming, and kind of adorable. Then, you should be the Fairy Godmother. You're so crazy about this whole story. He's not my type, but he is yours. If nice is not your type, we need to have a serious conversation. I'm dating the dog-walker. No! No, please, marry the poet, and live in nineteenth-century bliss. I'll knit you an afghan detailing your love. (phone dinging) He's talking. He says... Josh: I need you to tell me the truth here. How horrible was it reading my sappy, overemotional letters? Believe me, I'm very glad you took pity on me and offered to return the ring, but it's a little mortifying trying to remember everything I said, and knowing you've read it all. Respond to him, now! You do realize this is a stranger, right? He's just a broken-hearted guy who rightly seems a tad insecure at the moment. Ugh, fine! Uh... (typing) You were expressing your feelings to a woman you loved. It's honest and vulnerable, not sappy. And if someone doesn't see that, they're not the right person for you. See? You're perfect for each other. (dinging) If only you could've shared this wisdom with me 18 months ago. This is a terrible idea. This is a terrible idea. You don't know each other. What do you have to lose? (phone dinging) Josh: It feels bizarre that we could walk right by each other and not even know it. Hayley: I've spent my whole life in this city and I don't actually know where your street is. You could just use the maps on your phone. Who says my carrier pigeons aren't honing in on you now? I'm happy to tell you whatever you like. You don't need to send your pigeon spies. Are you still in love with Marisol? I don't think so. Is that terrible? Of course not. We move on. Experiences change us. Trust is a funny thing. So tough to earn, so easy to lose. So, you're one of those people who only trusts yourself? Ha! Not at all. I sometimes have more faith in the few people close to me than I do in myself. Are we exchanging real names or identifying details? Is it all right if I say not yet? Of course. (phone dinging) Is there a deadline to our online masquerade? Maybe we'll remain secret friends forever, discussing the mysteries of the universe and the worst flavors of ice cream. Earl Grey. There's no question there. (laughing) Oh, come on! Earl Grey ice cream is delicious! No! It tastes like old tea bags! (laughing) What's so funny? Nothing, just a meme Alex sent. Josh! Less memes, more work. Copy. This could be some kind of scam. You don't think she'll actually send you the ring back? She already did. A courier showed up at my house at nine a.m. This girl paid for a courier. I doubt it's a scam. She seems cool from those messages. She does, but anyone can seem cool when they have time to plan what they're going to say. You sound very un-Josh-like. You love the mystery of this kind of stuff. I like talking to her, that's true. But I just wish I had the same kind of faith I used to that things would magically work out. The Josh I've known since college would tell me even detours are leading you somewhere. And somehow, that's led me to a disappearing fianc?e and an office building being turned to rubble. But old Josh would say it's paving the way to something better. Old Josh was usually right. You're probably right. Marcus: Thyme, basil, all that kind of stuff. Now, I know it's tempting to just want to rip the tomatoes off, but they're very delicate. What you want to do is lightly twist while you're pulling. That way, the tomato will come right off and you won't damage the vine. Look at that! Great work! That's amazing, nice! (chuckling) Nice job! You're learning so fast. Now, we can use this with other fruits and vegetables. Um, apples, strawberries, pumpkins. Mother Nature knows what to do. And that's our pitch. Mother Nature knows what to do. We teach our kids to respect her, work alongside her without getting in her way. Yeah Is there anything else I can do for you? No, but thank you. No spying! (scoffing) (phone dinging) Josh: Sometimes I think consideration is a lost art. Hayley: I don't think it is at all. We're in a new era. It's not just about what you need, it's about deciding what's truly an issue and what comes down to individual choices. Josh: Now, that is wise. (text whooshing) Oh, Hayley? Hi, me again! Um, do you mind doing your meeting in your office? Because we have a graphic designer coming in and we could really use the space. We have our entire programs team coming in today. I can't fit that in my office. We could really use the space, though. And if it was just Elisa and I, I would totally let you guys have it, but you have one designer and we have four people coming in with sports equipment and a few pieces of gardening, and t-shirt mock-ups. I can't fit that in my cube. Fair enough. Lucy, do you mind doing our meeting in the common area? I guess not. Great, not a problem. Great. (both laughing insincerely) Thanks. Yeah. I kind of like Josh Burns... sometimes, sometimes. But he also drives me bananas. He's always in the office. He's there when I get in, and he's there when I leave. He sounds like a worker bee. What's wrong with that? It just makes me feel like I'm not working hard enough. Well, maybe his job doesn't take him out of the office as much as yours does. And this might come as a big shock, but he might not even notice whether you're in the office or out of the office. He doesn't like the smell of my incense, for some reason. Hayley, it's really strong! Even for me, and I like it. Oh, no one likes the smell of my incense. There must be something good about this guy. Well, he's really good at what he does. Aha, and that's what's driving you nuts. You're always the most ambitious person on the grant hunt. Maybe you've met your match. And maybe we'll lose. Rise to the challenge. That's all you can do. (phone dinging) Josh: How was your day? Hayley: Is "ugh" a descriptive enough response? Because ugh. Anything I can do to help? I am an ugh whisperer. Not unless you run a magic wand repair service. Mine seems to be all out of pixie dust. Just because you didn't get your way on a couple of things doesn't mean you're out of magic. I'm fine. I'm just a little overwhelmed and trying to find my voice again. If it's any consolation, I hear you loud and clear. Oh! (laughing) Looks like we're a little bit too focused on our work. Work? I was playing a puzzle game. Oh, that sounds a lot more fun than looking at cheaper prices of dirt. Hazards of the job. Is dirt expensive? Oh, yeah, everything's expensive, especially when you say the words "non-profit." Right? It's like they see you coming and up their price. That's why when I email, I do it from a personal account. Then, there's no way for an up-charge. Smart. Oh, thanks. Um, and I'm really sorry about the incense. I didn't think it would bother anyone. Oh, I'm sorry for being overly sensitive. I have a nose like a Bassett hound. Looks like a pretty average guy nose to me. Thanks. (phone dinging) Oh! I think this is yours. Thank you. Looks like a fun game. Hayley, wait, I'm... Hey, you didn't respond to my message. We're going to get this grant, it just makes sense. Yes, thank you for that. Hayley saw your message on my phone. Oh, no. I don't know how to fix this. Say you're sorry, and then, if she doesn't accept it, oh well! This is a competition, Josh. Someone has got to lose, and if there's a choice, I'd rather we be the winners. Okay, we need to work on your bedside manner. ? Did the poet say something weird? What? Why? Because you look like you're trying to crawl out of your own skin. I wish it was the poet. That way, I could block and forget he even existed. I saw a message on Josh's phone from his assistant saying that Mainframe is a better charity because all we do is plant tomatoes. But our produce goes to soup kitchens! You're not upset about this, just a little bit? I think she's scared, actually. That's something I've never considered. Everybody and their brother are giving kids tablets, you know this. But even schools are cutting field trips and gardens. You know what, you are so right about this. What we're doing is the next thing. It's the renaissance of nature, rescuing kids from losing touch from the outdoors. Don't let her intimidate you. No, we're going to win this, us with our tiny, little, cute veggie plants. (laughing) Marcus in video: Don't just see one individual plant. See them working in concert, using resources together. (phone dinging) Josh: It's my turn for "ugh". What do you do when you realize you've been a colossal tool and need to make amends? As I'm a perfectly lovely person at all times, I wouldn't know. Wink emoji. Is that a fact? Not at all. I have my moments like everyone else. Did you try just saying you were sorry? Maybe in the vaguest, most humiliated sense. So, no. It's not revolutionary advice, my dear poet. Swallow your pride, and assume the feeling is far worse on the other side. Are you a life coach and is this conversation really a long sales pitch to hire you for your services? I'm a better sales person than that. You wouldn't see me coming. Probably not. Is that a challenge? Is that an invitation? Alex says put yourself out there... Good work, terrible poet. (knocking) I wouldn't try any corporate espionage if I were you. Although, I don't think your pitch would work with giant photos of tomatoes. I'm sorry, that message was catty and mean. Yeah, it was. I could try to apologize by saying I didn't write it or respond to it. I think I've heard a similar sentiment come out of your mouth before. I don't feel that way at all. I'm intimidated by you, and I've been trying to throw you off your game. Is that an apology? I am sorry. (laughing) I'm sorry you had to read it and that it was said. And I let Lucy know it's not okay. You're intimidated by us? Well, by you, more specifically. You're calm and focused, and you have this "when I talk, people listen" quality about you. Really? Yeah. Not to mention, what you're doing is incredible. Taking the things that have been stripped out of schools and you're trying to-- Put them back and preserve them, yeah. Yeah. Your first two non-profits hit $1 million in funding in their first year. That is unheard of. Mainframe hasn't been quite as fast. People are much more resistant to putting tech into the hands of kids than I thought. I find that surprising. My cousin's kids are in kindergarten and they already know how to code, but they don't have a stitch of grass to play on. And see, that's exactly the issue. People feel like it's oversaturated, but kids don't need to be told what to do, and that's a mistake we're making. They need to discover it for themselves. Zen Forward, they get you. You have nothing to worry about. But you don't get me? I actually think I do. We're a lot like each other. We're competitive, ambitious... Mm-hmm. ..and we both are... pretty decent people. Yeah, and I'm really starting to see the value in what you do. Ouch! I really am kidding. Kidding. You're changing the world, Josh. Thanks. Yeah. Well, I'll let you get back to your tomatoes. Yeah, tomatoes! (laughing awkwardly) Yeah. Good night. Good night. (giggling) So, you just didn't respond to the poet's invitation? Well, we don't know if he and I would get along in real life. Yeah, that's what you're worried about. Elisa, I don't know. What if none of this is real? Then, I have to hand it to Poet and Marisol, this is the most elaborate ploy ever. Hoping you'd maybe one day open a random box, then, spend days reading someone else's letters and get so emotionally invested-- Okay, okay! I know that I'm being silly. I think you're playing it too safe. I mean, you take risks in business. It's time for you to take some in your personal life, too. Why does everyone always say that? I take so many risks! I'm Hayley the risk-taker. You back slowly out of the room when a date sneezes. And you don't walk away from a guy whose hobby makes your eyes swell up. It's his career, Hayley. Look, I'll always be your old lady canasta partner, but you need some new friends. More than friends. And I think the poet might just be the guy. You need to meet the poet. Just once. And if you don't hit it off, fine. Fine? (sighing) Okay, I'll meet him. Yes! Ooh! Hayley: Hey. About last night... No, don't say that. (phone dinging) Josh: Clearly I freaked you out last night. I shouldn't have asked. And I shouldn't have blown you off. I'm sorry. I just got nervous. No pressure from me. We can stay secret friends, just like you first said. No. We should meet. Soon? But I'm a little swamped at work, so maybe we could table the serious talk until next week? But how will I ever discover whether you say it "ketchup" or "catsup"? (laughing) Soon. Is that enough? What more could I ask for? Videos of kids hiking, talking about their time outdoors. The clip with Marcus. Your segue into being partners with Mother Nature. But carefully avoiding the insinuation that progress is bad. We need technology and humanity to walk hand in hand. What if we didn't tell them? We just showed them. I'm pretty sure Sasha Raymond doesn't want to trudge out to the farm upstate. No, but she's super into that artisanal jam. So, what if we picked a basket full of produce, brought it in that morning as a visual of what our kids can do? I like it. Maybe they even take the food home with them. They don't need Josh and Mainframe to give them tablets, they already have those. But if Sasha's making a salad with our ingredients, she'll end the day thinking about Growing Out. Brilliant. Brilliant! Oh, we got this. Yes! Marisol? Hi. How did you find me? Lucy gave me the new address. I was hoping we could talk? Let's grab a coffee. There's not a lot of privacy here. Okay. I guess I should start with an apology. I'm sorry. Truly. How I left was cowardly and weak. And cruel. That's fair. That wasn't my intention, but you're right. So, what happened? Did you fall out of love with me, or did I do something terribly wrong and somehow I didn't realize? No, nothing like that. You know how I always wanted to live in other countries. Japan and Southeast Asia, and anywhere else that would have me. When we first started dating, yeah. But then, you stopped talking about it. Except I didn't really change my mind. We got engaged and I got scared, thinking of sake and cherry blossom trees and how now I'd never see them. How we'd have babies and I'd be drowning in diapers and pacifiers. I got scared, I'm sorry. So, you've been in Japan the last year? I have. I found a cheap ticket and I just... Ran. Yeah. Why'd you take the ring when you left? Why didn't you just send it back? I lost it. It wasn't intentional, I swear. I left so quickly, I had to hire a moving company to pack everything up. I sent my brother to go through my storage unit, and that's when I realized it was gone. Please believe me when I say I feel terrible. I know how much your grandmother meant to you. I'm so sorry. It's not gone. It's in my apartment. The person that bought the condo after you, they found it and sent it to me. That's a miracle. Yeah. It's almost like a sign. If it is a sign, I don't think it's the sign you're looking for. You really think after everything, we can't make it work? I don't think we should try, Marisol. So, you're saying you don't still love me? I'm saying I'm a different person than I was a year ago. And so are you. If you weren't happy being stuck here before, you're gonna feel the same way again. Coffee? Uh, no, thanks? Is that an answer or a question? Sorry, I'm stressed. I probably don't need any more caffeine. You're going to do amazing tomorrow, no matter what happens. Thank you. This week flew by. Tea. Lemon balm tea to calm and relax you. Then, you can go back to your effort to crush me in the boardroom. It's futile, but Zen Forward will appreciate the effort. Here you are. Steep for about ten minutes and it will be good to drink. Thanks. You should host a clinic on using nature to soothe the savage urban beast. You should see my remedies for colds. Buck up, buttercup. It's almost over. I can't believe you didn't tell me about this poet guy until now. I thought it was just gonna be a few-day adventure, tops. And now, I don't really know what it is. So, you left it like that? You've agreed to meet the poet, but you don't know when? Well, there hasn't really been a lot of chatting today. If any. I don't know what to say at this point, and maybe he feels the same way. You've broken the spell. What? In the beginning, relationships exist in a bubble. I haven't had much online dating experience, but I imagine that the bubble is even stronger because you don't have the real world sticking its head in all the time. But once the bubble bursts - in your case, when you guys started talking about meeting - then there's an adjustment period, and the world catches up pretty suddenly. How do you get past that? Can you get past that? Mm-hmm, with work. Depends whether you want to move into a new phase, that's messier and stickier, or do you just want to carry on and search for a new bubble? Is that what my problem is? I'm always looking for the bubble? Oh! No, Hayley, I don't think that's your issue. I think you're wary of the bubble, almost too wary. You wait for relationships to explode, and sometimes you just push them enough to make it happen. Then, how do I stop myself? Write him back. Okay. Don't let silence be your message, darling. But Mom, what if he's not interested in life, and the world beyond the bubble? Well, then you'll know. Hey. Hope you had a great day. Too casual? (text whooshing) (phone ringing) Elisa: What did you have to say on the phone that couldn't have been said in 17 texts? You never read my texts. Wait, are you in bed? Yes. We have a big day tomorrow. Josh, he said something to me today that seemed like a throwaway, but it has me thinking... That we can talk about it tomorrow? That we can spend the next twenty minutes exploring it now in case we want to add it to the pitch. Ugh. You'd better bring extra coffee in tomorrow. I always do. You're not going to respond to her? Yesterday you were all about this girl. Well, that's just it. After talking to Marisol, I'm starting to wonder if I actually have feelings for this Fairy Godmother or I just love the idea of it all - some way to live the best parts of an old relationship. How was it, seeing Marisol again? Are you sure you don't still have feelings for her? Should I get back with her? No! No, not at all. I just... I want you to be more upfront about dealing with the emotional stuff so it doesn't trip you up later. It's time to start dating again. If not this Fairy Godmother, then someone else. About that... there is someone, but it's kind of complicated. When isn't it? (beeping) Boo. Oh, come on! You can't bring gifts to both meetings! I know the rules of etiquette. Besides, these aren't gifts. Let's call this show and tell. No peeking! This at least has to constitute a grey area. I assure you I only deal in bold, vibrant colors. Hi, guys! Both: Hey! Are we ready? Yeah. Okay. Please join us in the conference room. Ladies first. Thank you. What do you do when you're stressed? Do you go take a hike? Maybe you spend a few moments at your garden window. There are any number of charities across the world right now putting computers and tablets into the hands of kids. But we're not everybody. Why don't you tell me about all this. I looked at the spices in my grandma's house and I decided to grow them. (Hayley gasping) This one's basil. This one's thyme - it's really stinky. And then, this one's oregano. When we added an app-making class, we expected the kids to make the same old computer programs that we made in computer science. But within a few weeks, they were making games - actual, playable games. We've been holding these kids back by restricting their access to technology. Getting your hands into the dirt is not only fun, it sparks a lifelong curiosity to the food we eat and the world around us. It breeds confidence that we cannot teach. These are the voices of the future. I don't want them playing Aliens versus Spiders all day. I want them to actually understand how the game works, how to solve problems. Now, this right here is not a gift. No. It's a small, very small percentage of what our kids grew, harvested just this morning. Our kids, they know what Swiss chard is and they know how to cook it. Now, I don't know about you, but that was not a part of my vocabulary when I was ten. Because one day, this could lead to the development of a medical device that could measure blood loss in real time. The truth is we have more to learn from these kids than they can from us. Use them. Take them home. See what a few dozen hands in the dirt gets you, and think what hundreds more can do. I do not care if anyone sees me in my sneakers. Oh, you're prepared for everything. Oh, yeah. Wow. Yeah. Better? So much better. You were Incredible in there. Thanks. You, too. Although, I'm a little worried about children leading a robot takeover of the world. That's exactly what I'm trying to prevent, Hayley. I guess I wasn't as clear as I thought. No. It's gonna be a really tough decision. I'm glad I'm not the one making it. (sighing) Yeah. Well, now that you have your comfy shoes on, you wanna walk back to the office? You know, I think I'm going to play hooky for the rest of the day. Just please do not tell my boss. I promise I won't say anything to you about your day off. Thanks. I'll see you Monday? See you Monday. Bye. Bye. (phone beeping) Hayley: Hey. Hope you've had a great day. Josh: Honestly, it's been a weird 48 hours. Hayley: Need to talk about it? Josh: Marisol showed up. She's been in Japan the last year. Hayley: Wow. Are you okay? Josh: Yes and no. I didn't realize until I saw her just how much I've kept my life on hold since she left. Hayley: And now that you've had some kind of closure, do you think that you can finally move on? Josh: Yeah, about that... ? How are you even here right now? And with the exact same pizza. Well, there's a lot of possible answers to that - fate, destiny... Oh! You got that pizza coupon text, right? Yes, I did. Well, maybe the employee's name is Destiny? Do you want to join me? That is if you feel okay dining with the enemy. Well, we're done pitching, So you're not the enemy anymore, if you ever were. Great. Have a seat. Thanks. No problem. It's delicious. Oh, you've tried this before? Oh, many times. It's my favorite thing to eat. I've gotten the coupon once or twice. Oh, yeah. You know what's so crazy? Is I literally see you every single day and I don't know anything about you. You know, I don't know anything about you, either. Other than your almost mystical connection to nature. Well, it's not really that mystical. My mom had a rooftop garden when I was a kid growing up uptown. Still does, actually. And I always thought it was so cool and appreciated the fact that a female stock market maven grew herbs in her spare time. See, I feel like knowing this about your mother explains so much about you. (laughing) Yep. And what about you? What was your family like? Youngest of three brothers, all of whom work for my dad's accounting firm. My mother was a librarian. Oh, a librarian, interesting. Yeah. Yep. Okay. So, you were a bookish kid. Is this somehow revelatory or...? No. I just like picturing little Josh with his nose in a book. Nose in books, nose in the local library computers, trying to fix them when their budgets couldn't afford IT people. Oh... Really nerdy. Nerdy, yeah. Yeah, yeah. (chuckling) But I guess we're both products of our own upbringing. Yes, exactly, which is why I'm trying to instill these values to the children young. I'm already on-board. You don't have to sell it anymore. I believe you. I like it. It's good. Oh. Thanks. Elisa: "I've never thought of love as ma "Love isn't rare.w. "It doesn't mask the bad parts of the world. "It changes the light around them, "makes you see what's truly important." (sniffling) (sighing) ? Well, this is me. This is where I will leave you for tonight. You live here? Like, right here? (laughing) Yes. I promise you, it's a really great neighborhood. I know. Lots of character here. Yeah, I don't need the same coffee shop every two blocks. I really do love my two-storey walk-up. Nice. Listen, Josh. Whatever happens tomorrow, good luck. You too. Thank you. Yep. Thanks. Good night. Good night. ? ? What did I just see? I don't know. I'm walking home and I hear you laugh, and I look over, you're having a full on moment with Mr. Might Walk Away With Our Grant Money. That is totally normal to be spying on me like a nosy sitcom neighbor. I wasn't spying. I was walking home. Do you like Josh Burns? What about the Poet? I feel so out of the loop all of a sudden. The Poet dumped me. Well, not really because we never were in a real life relationship. But he realized he had feelings for someone in his real life and I thought... so do I. But you and The Poet have so much in common. Except that we don't. We don't know a single identifying thing about each other except our addresses. So, Josh Burns? Yeah, Josh Burns. (giggling) Say you date him, what happens if we compete against him again? I don't know. But I'm tired. I think we should go to bed. Or we could stay up watching romantic comedies. Oh, yeah! That sounds so much better! (sighing) (phone beeping) (camera shutter clicking) Two dollars off the best tiramisu in town. It's after eleven. Who's in charge of sending these texts? Got your favorite. Thanks for coming out, man. I know it's late. Are you kidding? I had to. You think Hayley Hammond is your Fairy Godmother? I saw her building. She has to be. It's Marisol's. Could they maybe just live in the same co-op building? It's a long shot, but it could happen. I saw the letters. They were sitting right there in her office. (exhaling sharply) Is this... good? You liked both women but now you find out you really just like one woman. I'd call that a win. She lives in Marisol's old condo. She's read every sad, weepy love letter I've written to an ex-fianc?e. The first time she invited me over for dinner, I'd be really hard-pressed not to run the other way. Except you didn't seem to care about that when she was just a voice from the internet. Because I wasn't thinking about it. It wasn't real. I think my reaction would be the same if we ever progressed to meeting face to face. Look, I can't tell you what to do. But you know it isn't easy to find someone you really connect with, and the universe keeps throwing this woman in your path again and again and again. If you ignore it because you're a little embarrassed-- Embarrassed? Try suffering from abject humiliation. (stammering) All right, it's rough. But you're being a little over-dramatic. She's read the best and the worst of you and she still likes you, Josh. There's a lot to be said for that. Do you think that Josh is avoiding me? He's always in the office by ten a.m. If you continue to ask me, I'm gonna start avoiding you. (phone ringing) (phone ringing) It's Zen Forward. (phone ringing) Speakerphone or I never make you my famous apple pie again. I love you, but you buy that pie from the bakery in Union Square. Good morning, Sasha Raymond. Sasha: Hello there, Hayley. I'm so excited to be making this call. (squealing happily) (squealing happily) (squealing happily) That can't be good. (screaming happily) Act cool, act cool. (screaming happily) They love my plants! (screaming happily) Congratulations. I just spoke to Sasha Raymond. Oh, Lucy, thanks so much. Thank you. And I have to tell you, Josh's pitch was fantastic. I'm a really big fan of what you guys do. Yeah, well, it's wasn't a total loss. Zen Forward did decide to give us a small grant. Fifty grand isn't two hundred and fifty, but it's something. That's amazing. This will be tough on Josh, though. He fancies himself this Techie Poet who can talk anyone into the powers of technology. It's hard on him when he realizes that he can't. I'm sorry, um... did you say Techie Poet? Oh yeah, it's this nickname that he got back in college. I don't know. I told him that, over the age of thirty, it's questionable, but he seems pretty attached to it. I'm sorry. Would you happen to know where Josh is right now? I don't. Uh, I think he said he was taking the day. Thank you. Nice talking to you. This is crazy. Why would you even think that he'd come here? (sighing) Hi. Hi. I hear congratulations are in order. Oh. Yeah. Thank you. You too. You don't have to temper your excitement. I know this is a huge moment for Growing Out. No, no. I really am legitimately happy for you, and that's entirely separate from my unabashed glee for Elisa I. Listen, I have an insane question to ask you, and you might want to have me involuntarily committed, but I promise there's a reason for it. I know you're the Fairy Godmother, Hayley. Oh. So, did you know during dinner or was my freak-out on your front steps the big reveal? That was you freaking ou Oh, I thought we were having a very sweet summer in the city moment that could've lead to... Oh God. Oh no. That was all in my head. You trying to run away when you realized who I was. That is-- I promise, we were having the same moment. Just when I saw your front door, my brain short-circuited. If my fight or flight response didn't tip you off, then how did you know? Lucy. Lucy. Yeah. She called you the Techie Poet, which I thought sounded really bizarre, but then... also right... somehow. I really like you. Both versions of you, all of you. And I can't change my address, and I truly can't because it took all my savings to buy it. But... I'm hoping you'll see past that. If it's not too much to ask. Well, I was just walking down here to get two pieces of tiramisu because of this coupon I got texted last night. But then, I was thinking of walking by your place to give you a dessert and a congratulations and... maybe take you out for dinner. If that's not too much to ask. I think that sounds... perfect. ? This is the strangest ending to a fairy-tale I've ever heard of. You think this is the end of the story? This is just the beginning, my dearest Poet. ? ?
