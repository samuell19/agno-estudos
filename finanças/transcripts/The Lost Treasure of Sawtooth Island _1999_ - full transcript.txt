(inspiring music) (seagulls calling) (phone ringing) (alternative rock music) - [Danny] You getting that or what? - I got it. Listen, will you turn that music off? And get dressed, we got a job this morning'! - Take it easy Gramps, we got tons of time. - Hey, that's mine! - It's mine now. - Oh, you rascal. No Toby, I'm not talking to you. And what are you doing? - [Toby] Why do you tell me something like that? - Well, I thought you were gonna start warmin' up the engines! Get goin'! (Toby shouting) ♪ One thing I can learn from you ♪ ♪ Way to make my frightened heart be true ♪ ♪ Hoping you can understand ♪ - I thought I told you to knock off this music. Well, what are you doing now? - Nothing, boss, I'm gettin' dressed. I got a rocket in my pocket. - You got a rocket in your pocket? You're looking' at your dad's stuff again, that's what. That phony bologna treasure stuff. - It's not bologna. Come on, Gramps, easy. - Give me this. Ah, and I know the old fool that's keepin' the fire going here, too. That Toby Williams. - Toby was there, he's got a right to talk. - No he hasn't, that old blabber-head! We had a deal. No more talk about Picaroon's gold until what? - Until I graduate. - Ah. - Gramps, that's like a zillion years away. - Just two years. Two years! And we shook on it, or am I just imagining things? - No sir, we shook on it. - We got a job this morning' to do, not some phony treasure hunt! Aw lordy. - Come on, why you takin' my stuff? - I wanna keep it with me for a while. And Danny, I don't want any more talk about Picaroon's gold while we're out there. You understand me? - Yes sir, I understand. (melancholy music) (horn honking) Danny! - Coming! What is it, Gramps? - Look, after we come in from the dive today, I want you to pick all your tools up, and the rest of that junk from the Madeline. - Why? - Because she's too big and too old, and we just don't have enough time to work on her, that's why. Besides, I think we ought to sell her. - Come on, Gramps. The Madeline belonged to Dad! - Listen, I don't wanna talk about it right now. You go ahead and you get a hold of Rufe and get down to the boat. And I'm gonna be leavin' in 10 minutes flat, you understand? 10 minutes. (upbeat music) (seagulls calling) - Looking for me? Oh, that's dangerous, I'm shaking. (grunts) Prepare to meet your maker! (yelps) (grunting) Okay, okay, Danny. Danny, Danny. That's, quit it, quit it. You're embarrassing. (groans) - [Danny] I see a white light! - I know you do, get up. People are watching, come on. - Okay, okay, you got me. Tell me the truth though, huh, I'm gettin' better. - Better? - Yeah! - [Rufe] Oh, Danny. Oh, Danny, Danny, Danny-- - Oh, come on, Rufe, I let you flip that little pin away. I mean, that was obvious. I wasn't even trying. Where's my shoe? - [Rufe] Danny, look, have you ever thought that maybe Toby got your dad's last words mixed up? - No. Are you serious, no! My dad told Toby if I ever went after the treasure, I should know how to sword fight. - Yeah, but that's wacky. This is a high-tech time, man. Pirates and sword fighting, that's not real. - You wanna talk about real, huh? Well, Picaroon was a real Irish pirate. His gold was in a real Chicago museum, and when the mob heisted it, they put it on a real lake freighter-- - Called the Morning Sun, you've told me a million-- - And the Sun sank, carrying with it 42 gold bars, 500 diamonds and rubies, and priceless gold coins. - That belong to the kings of Pete, you've told me-- - Kings of Crete. Each one's worth a fortune. - I think you're gettin' a little nuts about this. It's all we talk about anymore. (horn blaring) - Ah, we're late! Oh hey, listen, before we go out there, don't mention a word about Picaroon, okay? You know how gramps is. "Grr, they're gonna call us Picaloonies!" (chuckling) Come on. - Yeah, we'd better go. - I gotta put my shoe on. - Come on, Danny. - Yeah, looks like Rufe's comin'. Where's Danny? - Well, knowin' Danny, he's got plenty of time. Almost 10 seconds. (upbeat music) - Hey Rufe, where's Danny? - He's comin', he had to put his shoe on. - Really? Well while he's doing that, I'm leavin'. - Here he comes now. - Let go of the bow line! - Better do it. He ain't gonna make it. - He'll make it. (laughs) - I knew he could make it. (horn blows) - Hey Rufe. - Gotta talk to ya, cowboy. - Oh, hey, listen, me first. Don't mention anything about Picaroon out here. - That's what I'm tryin' to tell ya, I did something real dumb! - Like what? - Danny, get up here! - Hey, comin' boss! Come on, what? - Gotta go. - Danny, get over here. (tense music) - What is it, Gramps? - Take over and hold her steady on. - What is it? - I'm tryin' to make out that boat up there. - [Danny] It looks like Doc Biehler's boat. - By golly, you're right, it is the Vega. What's he tryin' to do? Come starboard a little. That's enough, that's enough. Hey! Hey, I'll take over. What's he tryin' to do? (horn blows) Doc Biehler, you can't drive a grocery cart! Oh, that takes the cake. Now get in here. - Hey, what's the matter? Don't you know how to steer this thing? - Don't talk to me. It's your old buddy Doc Biehler. - [Toby] He ain't my old buddy. - Sure he is, he was your buddy when he went up with you and Danny's father up to the Sawtooths, lookin' for sunken treasure. Ha, what a crock! - Hey, I come up here and what do I get? Insult! - Well, nobody asked you to come up here! What are you doing up here anyway? Hand me the glasses. Go on. Well, what are you doing now? - I'm going back down to play with my carburetors. They like me. - Yeah, well I'm glad somebody likes you! (somber music) I blame Doc for everything that ever happened up there. - [Danny] Come on, Gramps. - Your dad would have never drowned if he hadn't gone with Doc up to that Sawtooth lookin' for that crazy treasure. - Well, Doc did a lot of research. I mean, he's got college degrees. - College degrees. College degrees don't make a man! - No sir. I just mean he had some pretty good charts. - That's a lot of bologna. All he had was a bunch of greasy old gas station maps that didn't even have the islands in the right place! No wonder they call us Picaloonies in town. I don't ever wanna see you talkin' to Doc again, you understand? - Gramps, I understand. I'm not even talkin' to him. I don't even know him. Take it easy. - Your mom, God bless her, just before she died, asked me to keep you away from all that craziness. And I've been, well, I promised her. - You've been doing a good job, Gramps. You warn me about it every day. - Danny! - And I'm gonna warn you about it, what does that man want, every two seconds! What is it, I don't understand you! - [Toby] Rufe needs some help in the galley! - He says Rufe needs some help in the galley. - Well do it, then get back up here. We gotta go over this dive. - Aye aye, skipper. (melancholy music) (sighs) Hey, buddy, what the heck is that? - Take a look. - What are you lookin' at, goober-head? - Who are you? - Listen, tell Toby I want out of this stinky little room or I am gonna make some big noise! (banging and yelling) - One of Toby's relatives. - That's what he's been talkin' about! Gramps is not gonna like this. Listen, just stay put, okay? I can't believe he did this. You remember his sister? - Yeah! The one who ate raw garlic and onions. - Tobe! - I know, I know, it's bad! - Yes, it's bad! - I hate it when people talk behind my back! - Oh yeah, well then, we'll just have to talk right in front of your face. - Go ahead! - Smokey Jean, you gotta settle-- - Smokey Jean? No, no. - You got it, partner, my niece. - Hot news, right? - Oh my god, he stows away his niece onboard. - I don't get it, who is she? - Smokey Jean Holman, Mick Holman's daughter. One of the guys who went with Dad after Picaroon's gold. Gramps is gonna think we're planning something. - [Ben] Danny! - It's gramps! We're dead. - If you love me, get back in there! - No! - Go! (groans) - Five more minutes, and y'all are gonna hear some language! (shouting) - What's goin' on down here, tea party? We got a dive to talk about! - Comin', boss. - Aye, aye, captain. - What a crew! I smell perfume in here? - No way, perfume? - No. - [Ben] Come on! - Why? - My sister told me she was in some bad school, and that she was in some kind of trouble. - What kind of trouble? - I guess she robbed a liquor store or something. - Keep her out of sight! - Me? - So where are you goobers headed? (laughs nervously) - Now the way I figure, we come in on this side of the wreck, and anchor here in shallow water. - Shallow water? - Yeah, because there's a pretty deep drop-off on this side. - Deep drop-off, you never said-- - I'm telling you now! Now there's supposed to be a big derrick arm right about in there, and the Coast Guard wants us to cut it down. - Well ain't this sweet? Now we're going after derrick arms? - Gramps, that's kinda big for us, isn't it? - Well, not for old hard hats like us. - Speaking of old hard hats. That dirty! That's Bud Calvin's stuff. Looks like he beat us to it! - Ah, that Bud Calvin has never done a job right in 30 years! I'm gonna dive. - Gramps! - Come on, come on! Help me get suited up, let's go. - What's going on? - Ben's gettin' ready to dive, and it's gonna be dangerous enough without you messing it up. (tense music) (chatting) - Danny? - Yeah, what is it, Gramps? - You're a good lad, and I love you. (gentle music) - I love you too, Gramps. - Put it on. - All right. - Easy. - Easy. - There it is. Got your stand there. Watch your step. - [Toby] Lookin' good Ben. - Careful, Gramps. (foreboding music) Gramps, you read me? - [Ben] I've got you, partner, loud and clear. I knew he couldn't do the job. It has stuff sticking up. Oh man. - What's he saying? - Hey, where is she? - In the galley. She's trouble, man. - Oh, hang on, hang on, I got him. Gramps, you're not on the drop-off side, are you? - [Ben] Nah. (grinding) What was that? - Yeah, I heard it too. Whoa, Gramps, what are you doing? - [Ben] I'm trying to, I'm trying to hang on. The current is kinda strong down here. - Hey, what are you doing? You're not supposed to be out here. - Darling, you're gonna have-- - [Ben] Come on, you guys, mark that line up there, will ya? - Do you guys know what you're doing? - Yeah, we know what we're doing, what are you talking about? - What's her deal? - I don't-- - [Ben] Hey! Gimme some slack on the torch, will ya? The visibility isn't too good. (grinding) (yelps) - Gramps, what is it? (groaning) We lost him! - Oh my god! - Can you hear me? (somber music) - Come on, Ben! - No, no! - Danny, no! - Come on, Gramps! No! - No, Danny! Danny, don't! - Come on! - Dear Heavenly Father, thank you for allowing Ben to be such a big part of our lives. We are grateful for all that he has meant to each of us, and especially to Danny. Give to Danny that everlasting comfort only you can give, that he may find peace and perseverance in the midst of all his troubles. May Ben's love continue to warm Danny's memory. May his words continue to echo in his heart, and may his example continue to encourage him. Grant that daily Danny may draw strength from these gifts which he has so graciously received from your goodness. Through Christ our lord, amen. - Hokey catfish, what is this? It's the sheriff, doll, you better get down. - Don't act so suspicious. You don't know what they want. - Well they sure want something, cowboy. (tense music) - What's going on? - I'd like you to step outside the vehicle. - What are you doing, padlockin' my door? - Toby, want you to settle down and listen real careful. You knew Ben held the mortgage on your place. - Of course I did, what're you tellin' me something dumb like that for? - Ben hasn't made a payment on any of this stuff in months. - That's a lie. - Calm down, Danny. So the bank is movin' to take everything back. The land, the boat, the trailer, everything. - Well, they can't do that. I'm a veteran of foreign war! Let me go! - Danny, we're gonna have to take you over to foster care. (gasps) (suspenseful music) - Run, Danny! - Come on Gramps, tell me where you put it. - Under the chart table. - Who are you? - Under the chart table, seems logical. - How did you know where it was? - Well, I always say if the moon won't tell ya, take a chance on Susie. - What the heck is that supposed to mean? Wait a minute, I know who you are. You're Reb Martineck. - [Reb] Really? - Yeah. Yeah, you went with my dad and Doc Biehler after Picaroon's gold. - Maybe you're not so dumb after all. Maybe you even know what to do with this. - What is it? - [Reb] Part of the Decco medallion your dad was looking for. Trouble is, you gotta get the other two pieces to find the gold. - What other-- - That's your problem. Get them, put them together, lay out the medallion on the ten mile map, and just maybe you'll be the one who comes up with the gold. Maybe. But I gotta tell ya. After watchin' ya the last couple of days, you better brush up on your swordplay. Sometime soon, you're gonna meet the one-eyed banshee. Right now, you wouldn't last a second. - Wait, who's the-- - Hey! - [Danny] Oh man, what are you doing here? - What do you think, I followed you. You aren't all that clever. - Yeah, thanks. Did you see where that guy went? - What guy? - The guy that was just here. - I didn't see anybody. - Yeah, right, so where's Rufe? And Toby? - How would I know? I think the cops hauled him off or something, I wasn't gonna stay around, what do you think I am? - I don't know, I really don't know. (foreboding music) - You know, I should of guessed that you'd be a stuck up, snot-nosed brick butt. (shushes) - What? - You know, why, huh? - Why? - Why did you have to come along with us on the boat? We never had any trouble like that before you came. - You think it's my fault that your grandfather died? - I didn't say that. - Yes you did. Yes you did say that! You know what, I take all those things back that I said about you, you're not any of those things. You're just, you're just dumb! - You guys, what happened? - [Rufe] He tried to outrun the sheriff. - I mean, with your heart and everything? - They was gonna stick me in an old folks' home. No stinkin' way! The truth is, Danny, they hate us. They kept calling me a Picaloonie. - Well, they're dead right about that, Tobe. - Where'd you get that? That's the Decco medallion. - I know! Reb was here tonight, he gave it to me. - No Danny, that can't be. Doc sent Reb over to Egypt lookin' for the medallion, but he died over there. - No, I saw him just a few minutes ago. He gave it to me, said all we have to do is find the other two parts. - I know all about that. Find the other two parts, snap them together, lay that sucker on the 10 mile reef map, and it points right to the treasure. (chuckling) (car approaching) - Oh, it's the cops. - The sheriff and I have been doing business for years, and I'm thinkin' he ain't never gonna forget about this. - You're probably right. So I figure we gotta leave, and we gotta leave tonight. - Tonight? - I say we take this medallion, we take the map, and we go find Picaroon's gold. - Jeezo peezo. - That's crazy! - Well, you wanna go to jail? And you wanna go to a foster home, Rufe? 'Cause you know that's where they're gonna take us. And Sunset Haven, Tobe, sittin' there on the porch all day long, nah. I made up my mind, I'm goin', and I wanna know who's with me. - I am. - They ain't dry dockin' this old sailor, I'm in. - I can't believe I came up here to get trapped with you-- - Wait, goobers? (sighs) - All right, I'm in, but it is only temporary, believe me. - But the cops are all over Ben's tug, how are we gonna get there? - We're taking this boat. We're takin' the Madeline. - What? - Danny, are you nuts? This boat is huge. Plus, it's trashed. - I know, that's why we gotta get to work. (groans) - Have you given any thought to how we're supposed to handle this old tub with just the four of us? And Smokey there don't know a main sail from a garage sale. We ain't got enough food for a short hot dog. Fuel won't last forever, and we ain't got no dang money. So how do you expect to get all the way up to the Sawtooth, magic? - Yes, a little magic will help. And Doc Biehler. - Everyone told you to stay away from that man, including Ben! - I know, and I wish I didn't have to do it, but Doc helped Dad out when things got tough, and now I'm hoping he'll help me. Now we gotta get these sails up, come on. - Bah! - All right. (upbeat guitar music) Did my dad ever say anything to you about a one-eyed banshee? - [Toby] Who told you about that? - Reb. He said I better brush up on my swordplay, because the banshee would be coming. - Doc was always talkin' about that. It seems the one-eyed banshee is like a lake demon guarding the gold. - Hey, take a look at this. (bell tolling) - It's a mackinaw boat. This is a bad, bad omen. - Oh, come on, Tobe, it's just an old sailboat. Broke loose from its mooring. - What, with all sails set? (ominous music) There's the buoy. (bell ringing) Doc Biehler's place. Cheery, ain't it? - So are we all goin' up? - Doc's real weird about visitors. Sometimes he likes them, sometimes he don't. Once me and Reb went up there with your dad, and Doc started yellin' at us on account of I had dirty fingernails and Reb kept usin' bad grammar. - I'm out. - Now listen, don't rile him up. Be polite. Good manners. And if he starts to blink real slow, you got trouble. - Come on, knock it off, Tobe. You're freakin' me out already. - What, a tough guy like you, nervous? - Hi, is your dad-- - Hey! - Is your dad home? - He's in the house, but I don't know if he wants to see anyone. - Okay, well, we'll just go on up and check things out for ourselves, okay? - [Mrs. Biehler] What is it? - Hi, Mrs. Biehler, I don't know if you remember me or not. I'm Danny Quinn, and this is Jean-- - I'm Jean Holman. - Yes, of course! Oh, look how you've grown. Come on in. Herbert, you'll never guess who's here. - Who is it? (foreboding music) My goodness, I haven't seen you two since-- - Probably since Dad's last trip to the Sawtooths? Five years ago. - It was a bad day, Danny. Sawtooth Islands. Now there's a name that conjures up adventure, Sawtooth Islands. Aptly named, I might add. - Actually, that's why we're here, to talk about the Sawtooths. - Really? - Yes, sir. That is if you don't mind. You see, Toby, Jean, and I-- - You're going after Picaroon's gold, am I right? - Please, Herbert, not that. Is that why you children are here? - [Jean] Yes ma'am, it is. - [Mrs. Biehler] Herbert, if I had known that, I would never have opened the door. - Now now, mother, let's not overexcite ourselves. Why shouldn't Danny and Jeanie be interested in the treasure? After all, they're young, vigorous. You know what, we're going into the den for this discussion. This is much more than just a chat. Come this way. I spent the better part of 12 long years pursuing Picaroon's treasure, and I swear your fathers and I came so close. - Herbert, you're gonna get these children worked up over nothing. - No, my dear, this is much more than nothing. Let me give you a little detail, makes it all a bit livelier. First, of course, was the pirate himself known as Picaroon. We don't know exactly what he looked like, but we think this old print from 1845 may come close. All we know basically is that he was a wild individual who liked his drink and his music, and he collected a vast treasure during his nefarious career. The treasure was found intact in '57 off the coast of Florida. It was a great prize, too. Diamonds, emeralds, rubies. Even contained the gold coins of Crete, part of the loot which has literally driven treasure hunters mad. - Oh, for heaven sakes, Herbert, not all of us. You'll frighten them. - Of course, not all of us. Then came the gangsters, modern day pirates. I'm sure you've heard your fathers talk about them. - [Danny] I know there are three of them. - Led by this man, Brigatti. - Bravo, Jeanie. How'd you know that? - My dad had the same pictures, and he used to sit around the table and tell stories. - This man Brigatti was the brains. He and two fellas heisted the loot and put it on a rust-bucket called the Morning Sun, all the while pretending they were loading it on another ship. Anyway, the Morning Sun got into a storm up in the Sawtooth Islands and sank. Of course, the great problem is-- - [Danny] No one knew where, except the mobsters. - Yes, that's right. - I wouldn't interrupt, Danny, if I were you. - The mobsters did know, because through a strange fluke, the three bad boys escaped the sinking. They were rescued by some Indian fishermen who later drew them a very accurate map of the ship's location, the 10 mile reef map, which your dad had, I believe? - Yes sir, we've got it with us. - Excellent. Now Brigatti, the clever fellow, managed to take the silver medallion from the front of the treasure chest, I refer to it as the Decco medallion because of its design, before the ship sank, and he later broke it into three pieces. - He gave each mobster a piece, and when you put it all together and lay it on the map, voila. You find the gold. That's the part of the story I love the most. - Angel knows the details of this as well as anybody. Have a cookie, sweetheart. - [Angel] Thank you, father. - Of course, the great dilemma is the same old problem. Finding the Decco medallion. - Well, that's not such a big problem anymore, if I can speak here? - Of course, don't be shy, speak up. - I wouldn't. - It's not such a problem, 'cause we've got this. (foreboding music) - I don't believe it. You got a piece of the Decco medallion. - How on Earth? - How? - Reb came by last night, he gave it to me. Said all I had to do was find the other two parts-- - Reb did not come back. - Yes he did, last night. - No, Reb has been dead for years. I know, he died in Egypt. - You must understand that, Danny. Tell Doc you understand now, Reb is dead. - You'd better tell him, Danny. - Look, doesn't anyone here get it? - Herbert, I forbid violence! - Danny, you've got a very bright partner there, you should have listened to her. So, Danny, let's assume for a moment that old Reb did come back. Give you any clues? - No. Sure, he said something about a one-eyed banshee. - No! - [Mrs. Biehler] Herbert, don't do this! - You fool, Danny. The one-eyed banshee hears and knows everything, and it's just waiting for someone stupid enough to go near the treasure. - Herbert, I am asking you to stop. - We can't turn back now, mother. - Absolutely not. Where's the medallion? - No! (suspenseful music) - Michael did this! (grunting) - Hokey Jones. This ain't bad grammar. Come on, you guys! Get in the boat, get in the dingy! Come on! He's behind, he's behind, he's behind, just get away! Get in, get in, get in! - Danny! Row as far as you want! Sail as fast as you will! You'll never escape! You hear me? The banshee will find you! Hear me, the banshee will find you! - Give me a hand! - We made it out. I got you, I got you. - Is he after us? - No, no, I don't see anyone comin'. - Let's get the heck outta here! - Okay. - Yeah, I think it looks okay. - Yeah, it's starting to feel better. (gentle music) Look, I don't wanna get cheesy about this, okay? But thanks. - Hey, it's okay. You knew something was gonna happen up at Doc's, didn't you? Right from the beginning. - I don't wanna talk about it, okay? - Fine. Find anything? - No, no. I think we need the other two parts. Hey, how's Smokey? - She's okay, but she is one strange girl. - You got that right. - [Toby] Hey, are you two bozos gonna give me a hand or not? I can't run this boat alone. - Aye aye, cap-i-tan. (laughs) - You still don't know how to steer this thing! - Tobe, look, I respect you, but look. We're goin' off course, and-- - You can when you learn to steer. When you learn to steer-- - Guys, come on! What's goin' on? - You both think this is some kinda dumb game. - Come on, Tobe, we know this is serious. - Well then why don't ya act like it? Now listen to me, we got no help from Doc. Which means we don't have a clue where the other parts of the medallion are. On top of that, he's probably after us. Plus there ain't no gas station out here, so what are we gonna do when we run out? - We'll sail, huh, this is a sailboat. Come on, we got the wind, no problem. - What about food? We got enough supplies for maybe a week, two at the most. - We'll fish, huh? Fishing's good, we know how to fish. - What if they're not biting? - [Danny] Rufe, come on, give me a hand here. - No, Rufe's right. Maybe this ain't such a good idea. I mean, three teenagers and an old codger. Oh, you're lookin' good, doll. How you feeling? What's up? (lilting flute music) - There's somebody coming. - It's that same boat, and someone's on it. - Looks like he's got a dog. - Whom do I have the pleasure of addressing? - I'm Danny. - I'm Peter Brand. I live down at Birdman's Point. Do you know where that is? - Sure, we know where that is. - What are you doing out here, Mr. Brand? - Well, believe it or not, I tried fishing. Never so much as a bite to save my name. Then when I turned toward home, fickle wind went against me. - You always take your dog with you? - Well that's an interesting story. Couple of days ago a boat just floated by my cottage. No one aboard but little Rosalie here. Abandoned by a storm, I guess. Mine now. Say, Danny, your rigging needs work. - Really, you think so? - Aye, I think so. Where you headed? (dog barking) - It ain't none of your business where we're goin'. (dog howling) And now your dang dog's gone nuts! - My dear friend, you really shouldn't use words like dang. (foreboding music) That's a word used by a dullard. Whose toy is this? - [Danny] It's mine. - Yours, eh? I'll tell you, if I were a young lad like you headed up this dangerous coast, I'd practice myself silly with this little fellow. Because your day is coming. - What is that supposed to mean? My day? - I'll tell you something else I'd do. I'd have music on this barge. You're all rigged a little too tight. Wouldn't you agree, Jeanie? (lilting flute music) - [Danny] Mind telling us how he knew your name? - Yeah, doll, how did he? - How would I know? What are you trying to say? - [Danny] I'm not saying anything. But you know what, I would like a few answers. - Answers, no, you don't want answers, you wanna accuse me. You're tryin' to get me to say that I know this Brand guy, aren't you? - [Toby] Yeah, cowboy, ease up. - [Danny] Well, do you? - Let me tell you something. I could care less about your dad's stupid dream or this stupid treasure, and I hope you never find it. - Well, you sure know how to handle women. - Come on, Tobe, don't you think she's been acting odd? I mean, she sees and hears things before any of us. Up at Doc's, she knew he was gonna try something, and now this Brand guy knows her name. - Yeah, I think it's pretty weird. - You know what, we should forget about it for now. We got other, bigger problems. - You ain't kiddin', like where do we go next? Without Doc's help, we're runnin' blind! - No we're not, we just keep headin' north right up to the Sawtooths. - Whoa, there's a hot plan. Talk about getting in deeper and deeper. Yikes! - So what are we getting into? - I don't know. - You think this Peter Brand's the one-eyed banshee? And Smokey Jean's working with him? - It's possible. But one thing is for sure, he's comin' back. - [Rufe] Great, so what are we gonna do? - Get ready for him. Where are the swords? (upbeat music) - You gotta hold on to the sword. - I'm getting better. I'm going to be a legend! - Keep dreaming, bro. (grunts) - Give me that! - Toby, I know how to sword fight! - Listen, buster, I saw every Errol Flynn movie ever made. I can show him a few tricks. Stand back! (humming) - What are you doing? - I'm just looking at the map. - And you got the medallion out? - Yes, you can't look at the map without the medallion, right? - Well who told you you could just get this stuff out and mess with it? - Nobody told me, and I'm not messing with it. I'm trying to help, okay? (melancholy flute music) - You're trying to help, really? - Yes, I'm trying to help, but you're just too dumb to get it, so... - Hey, take it easy. I'm just trying to understand. - Danny, by the time you understand anything, it's gonna be too late. (foreboding music) (dog barking) (tense music) What are you doing? - Rosalie's onboard. That means Brand must be here too. - Here, you should have this. - You're scared too, aren't you? - Why shouldn't I be? I didn't know this Brand guy before yesterday. I don't trust him. - That makes two of us. Come on. (suspenseful music) She was right here? - What, did she like disappear? - Maybe she went forward. - Yeah. - Let's go. - What the heck is going on here? - I don't know. Look at that. - Man, you got something. (laughs) - Yep, I do. - Partner, we searched from stem to stern, there ain't nobody and no dog. - Forget all that, look what Smokey found. - Hokey Jones, that's Half Moon Island, right at the end of the Sawtooths. - So what is it, what's there? - I'll tell you what's there, old Half Moon lighthouse. Doc had some crazy theory about the mobsters landin' there, and about hidin' a part of the medallion up in the tower. We all argued with him about it, but we never got there, 'cause of what happened to your dad. - Okay, so we got a little time on our hands. What do you say we take a trip to Half Moon Island? - I think we dang well should. (laughs) (upbeat music) (shouts) - Danny, hold it up! Hold it up! It's a rapier, get back here, Danny! - [Danny] Is that it? - That's it, partner. Old Half Moon Island. Beginning of the Sawtooths. 50 miles of rocks and reefs and dingers that stick up on one day and are gone the next. Where your luck can go bad real fast. Like the old Morezan on up ahead. - [Danny] What happened to her? - Hit a reef up at the north end of the island. Ripped a hole in her hull. Dropped her entire load, brand new 'fridgerators Then she sank. One small mistake, the same thing can happen to us. (foreboding music) Well, are we gonna stand here all day, or are we goin' in? - We're goin' in. Oh, someone should stand guard out here. - [Rufe] That's me. - I will, I'm no good at climbin'. - [Rufe] But Tobe, I don't think climbing's the issue-- - Go on up the stairs! - Why don't both of you just stand guard? - Both of us, what for? - Just keep your eyes open, okay? (foreboding music) - Well this is beautiful, ain't it? The real danger's probably out here, and look where we're parked. - Maybe we should just look around down here? - No, no, Toby said it would be hidden up in the tower. - Okay, let's go. Okay, now where would you hide the medallion up here? Something's wrong, isn't it? - Something like that. (shouts) - I knew you'd be comin' sooner or later, wanting my piece. - Who are you? - Who am I? Who am I, who are you? (laughs) You look like some of Tommy and Johnny's little pretty heads, huh? - No. - Oh, I see you got his piece of the medallion. I know what you want, sonny. You want mine. - Come on, who are you? - I'm Tony Brigatti, from Chicago. (shouts) (laughs) Oh, you're smart kids, ain't ya? Smart like my old pals tryin' to trap me. I keep on the move, eh? One night here, another night there. So where's Tommy and Johnny, huh? Ah, come on, I know they sent you. - No. - No! - You're lying! - Let go! - No, Danny! (growling) - Time to fly like a little bird! - No! (muffled shouting) - Gah! Who's that? - It's your old buddies, Tommy and Johnny! They're here! - So you've all ganged up on me, huh? I knew it. I hear you! I know what you want! You're never gonna get it! - No! (shouting) Oh god! (body thudding) - Come on! (moans) - You remember when I said you were dumb? - Yeah, of course I remember. (solemn music) - Well, you're not. You saved us from Brigatti because you were smart. - I know, but let's not get cheesy about it. - Hey, you think they'll find it? - How the dickens should I know? (sighs) - Oh, I feel sick. - Me too. All I wanna do is find the medallion. - I think we went too far. - Yeah, probably. We should backtrack. (gentle piano music) - That's really pretty. - You want it? Here, you can have it. - Why would you do something like that? - No reason, just call it a gift. - Thanks. (chuckles) It looks stupid, right? - No way. - Why are you staring at me? - I'm just trying to imagine you as a liquor store robber. - A what? What are you talking about? - Toby said you robbed one. - Are you crazy, I'm not stupid. My mom told Toby that some of my friends did that, not me. - Then why'd you come up here? - Because my dad wrecked our family With all of his talk about treasure. He was never home, and he never worked, and he was always off with your dad looking for Picaroon's gold. And then my mom got sick, and it made my life miserable. And I blamed you and your family for that. I never really hated my dad. I loved him. I loved his stories about pirates and treasure. I never got tired of listening to him. Anyway, I came up here trying to put all of that to rest, but here I am once again under the spell of pirates and Picaroon and gold. - Is that why you seem to know things before they happen? - About a year ago, I started having this dream, and everything seems really familiar. You were in the dream. - What happens in it? It's Doc! (suspenseful music) Get our stuff. (shouting) - What are you doing? You're crazy! (grunting) (tense music) - Help me! (shouting) Come towards the boat, Toby. - Tobe, you okay, buddy? Come on, talk to me! You found it! (laughing) He found it! - Where did you find it? - It was right under my dingy. I sat on it the second time I went down. Is my luck runnin' good or what? - Yeah! - I got a feeling Doc's luck is runnin' even better. - Danny, he got your box, didn't he? - He got everything. Photos and the map. - Well, then that's all she wrote. - Danny, do you still have your piece of the medallion? - My piece right here. - Give it to me. (foreboding music) - There, pola. Pola, what does that mean? - It don't mean a dang thing. Without the 10 mile reef map, we're dead in the water. We don't know nothing'. - I know one thing, we can't take another beating like that. - You're right. I think it might be time we started talkin' about going home. - Home? Danny, I know you don't mean that. Come on, we've got two pieces of the medallion. All we need is one more, and then we've got it. - [Peter] Ahoy, Madeline, anyone aboard? - As if we ain't got enough trouble, here he comes. - We're in no shape to fight. - Actually, I am. What do you want, Mr. Brand? - What kind of welcome is this, Danny Quinn? - How'd you know my last name? - [Brand] I know all your names. It's quite simple, really. - Oh, I'm glad it's simple, then you can explain it to us. - Can I? - Danny, be careful. - I'll make a little wager with you, Danny. You beat me, I'll tell you everything. - [Danny] Works for me. (grunting) - Is that what you call swordplay? Let's try again, concentrate! You fight stupidly. (groans) Now here's an embarrassing position. What if I were the one-eyed banshee? - [Danny] How do I know you're not? - You don't! Your problem is one of temper, boy. You swing like a mad wood chopper. - Okay! Okay, you've proved your point, Mr. Brand. - I have three points. (mysterious music) Mystery, magic and mayhem. - I've seen those words before. - Have you now? The real purpose of my visit is to warn you about the storm. You've bad anchorage here. - All right, let's get the sails up, come on. (serene accordion music) - All right, all right, let's see it. Ready? - Huh? - Uh-huh. - Cool, all right now. - Man, he really moves fast. - This man is very clever. - He's the best sword fighter I've ever seen. - Who is he? - I don't know. But I do know where I saw those words, mystery, magic, and mayhem. It's a tattoo on Reb Martineck's arm. - So what does that mean? - I don't know, but I got a feeling we're looking at the one-eyed banshee. And I think he's after the medallion. - Before we start, I wanna say right off, I'm not here for the medallion. I'm only disappointed in your attitude. Defeated, beaten wit, I detest it. Let's not talk about that right now, music's better. Come on, my friends, join in, drive away the gloom. For you, young lady. - Thanks. - You look like a picker to me. (laughs) (slurping) - [Mrs. Biehler] Must you slurp when you eat your soup? (slurps loudly) (upbeat music) - Listen to their music. We're so close that I can almost feel the medallion. - I think we should slip over into the dark and... - Don't be foolish, the pair of you. If he is over there, you don't wanna meet him in the dark. - I don't know why you're holding back this way, Mother, we've been waiting for years to see him. - And you shall see him. Everyone wash their own plates, please. - Are we going to be rich, Father? - Absolutely, my little angel. - Now we do the most important song, Danny's song. - [Danny] Why do I need a song? - Because it'll help when you meet the one-eyed banshee, trust me. - [Danny] Yeah right, trust. - Danny's song comes in three parts. The first one we'll call Mystery. (melancholy accordion music) And the second part is called Magic. (upbeat accordion music) And the last? - Mayhem. (energetic accordion music) (upbeat music) - All right, let's go back to mystery. Mystery is the most important thing in sword fighting. No one should know how good you really are. You're a dangerous, unknown warrior. All right, come on, let's go. Good, good, move like that. All right, attack. Good, again. Again! Good! Then there's magic. The most important thing in sword fighting. You fancy yourself the greatest swordsman in the world. You become the sword, the blade, the tip, the very air it cleaves. No human eye can follow you. You're beyond this world, you're magic. Good, good. And mayhem. Now here's the most important thing in sword fighting. To be the best, you have to be mad. Crazy, filled with joy, absolutely loony. Use everything you got. You have to defy the laws of gravity, the laws of nature, the laws of animals and trees and butterflies and boats. You have to think with your toes. Attack. - Okay, I'm gettin' this, though, really. Let's start at the top, Mr. Brand. Mystery, I can do this. - Good, good, better. (grunting) More casualness, more ease. (upbeat music) That's better. That's better! Now remember, Danny, don't get overconfident. Always keep your weather eye open. - [Danny] Bingo. (Laughs) - Bingo, dingo. - You ever... You ever think about moving up here? - I don't really know what to think. I'm still a little confused about everything. What do you think? - Where's Peter? - He's down below sleeping, I guess. - Sleeping? He ain't below, neither is Rosalie. - His boat's gone. - Danny, I found this on your bunk. - Wait a second, this is the string to my medallion. - Oh great. Open it. - Danny, I warned you about keeping your weather eye open. Well, you didn't, and now you'll have to suffer the consequences. Losing the medallion won't matter to you anyway, because you are all whipped. Time for you to go home, because the treasure is all mine. Too bad my lessons never helped. Signed Peter Brand. - That dirty, low down, rotten-- - I kind of started to like him. - We all did. What are we gonna do now? - One thing's for sure, we're not quitting. - That's for dang sure! - Yeah, but what can we do? - Okay, look, look. If we find the last piece of the medallion before Brand, then he can't find the treasure. - There's no way he can. - And without the medallion, what's Doc's map worth? - It ain't worth tiddly zero. - So that means we could still be in the game. The spoilers! - Exactly. Get a couple of breaks and we could be right back in the lead. And another thing I was thinking about. You remember Brigatti said that the mobster named Johnny was still hiding on the island with his piece of the medallion. - The island's a big place, Danny. - You guys, look at this. - [Danny] Look, it's our little friend Rosalie. - I kinda started to like that little hound. - Yeah me too, but it means Brand is close by. - With our piece of the medallion. I say let's take it back. Come on. (suspenseful music) - Hey, remember, Rosalie has a way of disappearing. - Not this time, come on! - It could be a trap. - Come on, come on. - There she is. - Rosalie. (whistles) Rosalie. Hey, come on, come on, Rosalie. Huh? - Come on. - Hey. - Good puppy. - Don't run away. - Good dog. - Where's Mr. Brand, huh? What's she doing? - She wants us to follow her. - You know that? There's something up there. Yes, there's something up there, here. - Okay. - I'm gonna go up. - All right. (grunting) - Ready, up. - You got it. - Up, up. All right, thank you. (tense music) (yelps) (dramatic music) (shouts) We got the last piece of the medallion! (cheering) - Come on down, Danny, we got company! - I'm comin' down. Check this out. - Wow. - Wish we had the other pieces back. - What's goin' on? - These kids showed up. - Yeah, they wanna talk to you, partner. - You wanna talk to me? - No, he does. - [Announcer] Tomer was telling me the other day that he talked to-- (knocking on door) - Come on in, my friend. - [Announcer] Since he is on such a hot streak. - Sit down. - [Announcer] Some others that are not producing quite as well. - Good morning. Are you-- - I'm Edward Morningfish, and if your name is Quinn, I wanna talk to you. - Yeah, I'm Danny Quinn. How'd you know my name? - Looped in fly ball, and he drops it. He should use a bushel basket. - Right, a bushel basket. - Do you play baseball? - No, not much. - Not me. - Not really. - No, not since my legs went bad, '54. - It's really a fascinating game. It's a little like magic. - Yes sir, is that how you got my name? - Your father came through the islands a few years back. I never met him, but we all heard about him. I knew he had drowned over at Rooster Island. When I heard the Madeline had returned, I figured it had to be his son, and I thought now's the time to finally tell him the truth. I understand you found part of the medallion. - Yes, we did. You were one of the fishermen who rescued them, right? - You're pretty smart, Mr. Quinn. What else do you know? - I think you drew the 10 mile reef map. - Excellent guess. He said if I help them, they would share the treasures with us. Build the children a schoolhouse, a library. All lies, of course. I knew it, but I drew them the map. - We had that map for a while, but it was stolen by a bunch of dirty-- - It doesn't matter, the map is worthless. - I don't understand. - None of us on that stormy night knew where the ship eventually went down. It was still afloat and nearly outta sight when we rescued them. Plus there were many other boats that went down. But these were bad men, threatening men. (solemn music) You could put the medallion on it for 100 years, and you'll never find the Morning Sun. - Then all this work, my dad. And I suppose this thing's worthless too. - I'm afraid so. In fact, I can furnish the rest. - Where did you get these? - Some of the men found them this morning. Evidently a small sailboat hit the rocks out by the harbor. Part of the wreck drifted in, these were on it. - So that's the end of Peter Brand? - And all for what, huh? This ridiculous... What is this, polar star? What the heck does that mean? - Them refrigerators that the old Morezan dropped. They ain't nothing' but the emblem off the front! (laughing) - Then that should end all this madness once and for all. - But it doesn't. - I sure hope you know what you're doing, cowboy. - Me too. (foreboding music) - Danny, look! - What? His boat isn't wrecked, that's for sure. - He's dropping his sails. Something's wrong. Hold the course, Tobe. - [Toby] Aye, aye, mate. - What are you up to, Mr. Brand? - Bit of a setback, Danny. Not entirely unexpected. I wanna talk to you. - Listen, don't trust him. - Toss him a rope. - Danny. (groans) - I'm not feeling quite up to speed. - We heard you wrecked on the rocks, but your boat looks fine. And Rosalie, last time we saw her, was on the island. What's goin' on here, Mr. Brand? - You know, you should only believe half of what you hear. - I know who you are. - [Brand] Really, who might that be? - Somehow, you're Picaroon. The pirate who stole this treasure right from the beginning. - Now what ever would make you say something daft like that? - I remember all the stories my dad used to tell, and they all came back to me last night, just like that. - Well, this a quaint tact, Danny. - Yeah, you disguised yourself as Reb. That's where I saw that tattoo. You are the one who sent us off on this crazy journey. - I only gave you a little push. - A little push? You encouraged us the whole way. All your talk and your stories, and your music. You've sent us out lookin' for something that doesn't even exist. What are you doing? - I've got one more trip to make before my visit's done. Don't let the banshee get you into a corner, Danny. Keep your blade up. - Oh, the banshee? I'm still gonna meet with this great demon then, right? - Most definitely. - Bologna. I think I'm lookin' at a demon right now. - No you're not. I don't even know who the banshee is. But I know the creature's close. Goodbye to you. - Now Doc told us that Brigatti tried to fake everyone out by pretending to put the treasure on another ship. Maybe he put it on this ship, huh? The Morezan. - The names do sound alike, Morezan, Morning Sun. - Right, I think Brigatti knew there was a ship called the Morning Sun, so he used that name to put everyone off the trail. - Well, if that's true, he sure did, 'cause all these years everybody's been out looking for the old Morning Sun. - Exactly, and if so, the one clue that has to have some meaning is the medallion. I mean, Brigatti himself tore it off the treasure chest. - You're tellin' us that we're lookin' for an old refrigerator, aren't ya? - Has to be. - But-- - Has to be. - They floated away, they're scattered all over the place! - They're busted up now. - [Jean] Danny, I don't think that's it. - You know, if a refrigerator is full of coins and stuff, it wouldn't float so good. (foreboding music) - [Toby] Hey Danny, I found this metal detector. - Ah, thanks, Tobe. Hey Rufe, way to go. - Quit slappin' your hands together, and pay attention to business. There's a real lively current down there. - Tobe! - Things could go bad-- - You've told me 100 times. - Maybe you're not supposed to go down there. What if we're not supposed to find the treasure? I don't think it's a good idea. - Look Jean, I can't go on. Not until I prove that my dad was right or wrong about this. You see, I have to go. This was in your dream too, wasn't it? (mysterious music ) (beeping) - Hey Danny, did you find anything? - Nothing yet. (beeping) Hey everybody! - Well, well, well, look what I found. - So I suppose you're the great one-eyed banshee I've been hearing about. - Don't be stupid, no. That's nothing more than romantic nonsense meant to scare away the little people like you. No, I'm simply the man that's gonna be famous for finding Picaroon's gold, while you and your friends are simply gonna vanish. (chuckles) See how nice and smooth this is gonna work? I love that. I've been considerably smarter than you, Danny, right from the beginning. - All set, Father. - [Danny] Not smart enough. - Shut your low class mouth. (grunts) (foreboding music) (yelps) (suspenseful music) Angel! - The sword is on the deck house! - You said you wanted some adventure, Danny. (grunting) - No! - Hold on, you guys! - Danny, we're sinking! - Coming! (tapping) Oh boy. - Look what you've done to my family, look at this. Now you'll have to pay. You look surprised. But then, you come from insignificant people with no imagination. - But you're walking. - I must be cured, imagine that. Where are you running to, you silly boy? Oh, isn't this the way it should be? Wonderful. (swords clanking) (grunting) - Danny, remember the music! - Nothing can help you now. Not music, not clever words from a pretty girl. (shouting) (tense music) (yelps) You little beast, you're gonna regret that. (screaming) Ben! - The banshee. - It wasn't supposed to turn out this way! - The one-eyed banshee. - [Toby] Get the knot off like she's getting off down there. - I got it. - Yes! No, that's pulling it. You should have learned-- - Look. (gentle flute music) - You did well, Danny, I'm impressed. - I couldn't have done any of it without you. I mean, every move I made I learned from you. - That mayhem move at the very end was superb. - You saw what happened? - Yes, I did. - Can we get you something? - No, no, my dear. I see you found the refrigerator. - You knew about it all along. - Yes, that's true. The more time I spent with you all, I realized you should have it. You believed, Danny, and you gave that to the others. - Can I help you? - Ah, Jeanie, you know what the best part of this whole journey was? I got to meet my great great granddaughter. You. Time to go. - What about Rosalie? - No, she stays with you. (lilting flute music) Rosie's not part of my world. She's part of yours. Danny, here's one more thing. - My box. - Push me away now. Well, get on with it. Open your treasure, Danny. - Move over, Rufe. - You open it with that. - [Toby] Wow, pull in there. (laughing) - Hit it from the side. - All right. - Know how to use that, Tobe? - All right, there! (giggling) Take it. - Here. - Set it right up here. - Here, Danny, take it. - Smokey? - Danny, open it. (uplifting music) (gold clanking) - He's gone. I wish my dad was here. I wish Gramps was here. - They're here, Danny. They're here. (laughing) (triumphant orchestral music) (upbeat music) (snoring) (laughing) (grunting) (gasping) (laughing) - Into my ear. Get out of here!
