Were they in Korean or English? Or what? I couldn't tell. I couldn't tell. I thought that they were arguing in Korean. Can you turn off the lights in the bathroom? - Yeah. Oh God, of all the times for this to go down. Do you want to open the windows? - No. They're taking someone through the alley. It's too dark, I can't see. It looks like a woman. Okay look at this. This must have something to do with what happened last night. This is down the block from my apartment. More blood. More blood. So this is further up the block. Look at this. Something big went down last night. Something crazy happened here. What the fuck happened last night? - What do you think? -Creepy. It's a coroner. There you have it. Murder in Koreatown on my block. Got a little gruesome pic here from the crime scene. Okay so she was 26. This guy was 31. I'm gonna see if I can find any of these neighbors, see if anybody knew these people. I just figure... Maybe this is an interesting thing I can make a video about. And what I don't understand also... Okay. Lets just see. Hold on one sec. Okay. So let's do a little recap of what happened. Oops. So there was a scream out there in the alley. And then... The police took her through the alley back here. See right back there there's the alley. They took her through there and then all the way through my apartment complex. Now what's weird is that her apartment complex is way down there. Uh, way down the block. So I guess the thing that's so weird to me is uh what she was doing so far down in this part of the alley. And then also... Uh... I'm wondering about the blood that was down there on the corner even further away from the crime scene. Okay, so I made this little map here just to sort of illustrate just how far away she was arrested from her apartment, the scene of the crime. And also look at how far away this blood that I found on the front street is away from the scene of the crime as well. So we'll be getting to the bottom of this real soon. - Here we are at the scene of the crime. I'm just gonna hang out here for a little bit. And see if anybody uh comes out. And I'll ask them If they know anything about what happened. So I'll be here. Well it seems like everybody's at work or doing something right now. So I'll take a little walk around the neighborhood, give you guys a tour, a flavor of the city. - Fuck you nigga. - Fuck you. Fuck you motherfucking niggers man. Don't steal again. - Don't come again! - Call the motherfucking police bitch. - Why you stealing? - Call the motherfucking police. Shut the fuck and call the police. You know it's not really going my way today I think it's a little hot and everyone's inside or at work. But I'm gonna come back out a little bit later or tomorrow and check back in. You have a question for me? - A question for you? What kind of question should I be asking you? - It's your movie, I don't know. You're the one that asks the questions. - Are you gonna try to murder me like that lady murdered her husband? Promise? - Only if you're bad. - Only if I'm bad? - Yeah. - Okay. Okay this guy sleeps right here on the uh... like in front of my apartment building. So he probably saw what went down. I'll ask him a little bit later when he wakes up. Did you see anything like... there was a guy out here he was bloody and stuff - No. - You didn't see anything? Okay, so you don't know what happened? - No. - Okay. Alright. Well thank you. - Alright. - Okay. Okay here we are back again another day at the scene of the crime. You know... Let's see here... Maybe I can get in and check on this place. Let's see here. Let's see here Okay. Well it's locked. I probably shouldn't be doing this anyway. Well I'll just hang out here. And uh see If I can find any of these neighbors without trespassing. So you didn't know her? - No, no actually I just moved in not too long ago so... - Oh really? Yeah so I don't really know anybody there. - Okay. - To be honest, but uh... - Where'd you move from? - But yeah, from Florida actually. - Oh really? - Yeah yeah. - Alright, murder in your new apartment complex, welcome to LA right? Yeah right. - Um. Okay well do you think that any of your neighbors might know anybody or like know any information about it? Like I said, I mean I just moved in and I don't really know anybody - Okay you don't know anybody - Yeah. To be honest, the neighbors aren't that friendly they kinda keep to themselves. Oh actually there, I think there is one lady that... she lives downstairs who might know something. She talks a lot, she's an old lady so... Okay. Um. Do you think there's any chance cause there's a gate over there um you can see it's locked. Do you think maybe I could come... you could bring me in there with you? And uh, I could try to talk to her a little bit? Uh, I mean... I dunno. That might be a little much. - It's too much. - Yeah cause it's it's kind of a sensitive topic. - Okay. Uh. Well how about this? Do you think I could get your number and maybe you could ask that lady? - Yeah. Yeah sure. - I'll give you a ring later? - Yeah hope it helps. - Alright. Thanks buh bye. Okay. Okay. - God bless you. Thank you. God bless you. Thank you. I heard a scream. Like I said I can't talk about it right now - Okay. Um.... Do you think we could talk later? Or? - Maybe, I don't know. Now is not a good time. - Okay. - Alright. Okay thank you. I think I'm going to call it a night. People really aren't that friendly they don't want to talk to me but that's okay, so... Uh... - You're crazy - Well I'm not that crazy... - Yeah. - Okay but, okay so what do you... you don't... You just don't think it's a big deal? Or what's your? - No. I mean I think it's like I mean obviously it's a really crazy thing to happen just... right down the street from us which is a little... you know... unsettling. ...A little? Why was she so far back in our alley I guess that's my question. I mean... It could be anything. Like it could just be some... small piece of evidence that that she needed to show them relating to the crime, I mean who knows? - She freaked out and ran I guess? - Yeah like she could've ran there or - Well... - I mean.. - I don't know. - Well what about the blood... In the front you know over on uh Pico and Menlo. That's like really far away from their apartment complex. - It's possible that he got got stabbed more than once. Right? And... It's possible that if you're stabbed without being life threatening you're just kinda bleeding all over the place, right? - So she stabbed him over at Pico and Menlo? And then ran back, he ran back to the apartment. - She chased him with a knife. It could be. Yeah. Right? I mean. - Well I don't buy it. -I don't know. I don't think it's. I think the case is closed. I think you're overreacting. I mean what do you think happened? - I don't know what happened. That's why I'm making... that's why I'm doing this. Cause I need to know. - I dunno I think you're gonna drive yourself crazy trying to figure this out. I think you just gotta give it up. - Well I just, I'm just getting started. So... So one thing, I... Uh... You might be wondering why you're not seeing my face. Uh, but... I'm a little bit camera shy... I don't really know if I want anybody to know uh... who's making this project. So... Here is... the alley. This is where they arrested the murderer. Okay, this is the back of the apartment where the body was found. This is also where the uh murderer at some point came though this uh little back part down to the alley right here. Some I'm just gonna hang out in the alley a little bit and see if I can't catch some of these neighbors. Hey excuse me. Yes sir? - Uh... I'm making a little video about a murder that took place. Uh.... So you don't really know that much else about what happened? Or... - No I don't. - Okay. Alright, well uh... Do you think your wife knows anything else, or? - No. - Okay. Alright. Well uh, Thank you very much for talking to me. - Thank you. - Alright have a good day. - Thank you. - Okay. You don't know anything? Okay, uh... Do you speak English? Uh not very much? Poquito? Okay so you don't know anything about the murder that... - No man. - No nothing? Okay. Alright. Okay thank you.... Okay. - No that's okay. ...No no no, please please. Please.... No no. - Okay thank you. Okay, finally... Excuse me. Um... I'm doing a little uh Documentary kind of thing about a... a murder that happened over in uh this apartment complex Do you live in that apartment complex? - Yeah I do. - Um... Do you know the lady who murdered her husband? Did you know them? - It's really sad I mean she was a sweet lady I don't know anything what happened. Okay you don't know what happened? - No. - But she was really nice. - Okay. Were you there the night of the murder? - Yeah I was there. I mean... I was home. - Okay. Um... But do you know why she did it? - I have no idea. - You... - I mean it creeps me out. - Okay. Yeah. It is pretty weird. - It's really sad. I don't want to really talk about it right now. Okay. Do you think it would be possible if maybe we talked a little bit later about- - I doubt it, no. - No I don't want to talk about it. - Okay, you don't want to talk about it? - No. - Okay. Alright. Well uh... Thank you very much I appreciate it. - Thank you. Ciao. - Okay. Have a nice day. Okay. Well that weird, uh I had it pulled up. Okay. Well... Here, have some... window. I was looking into getting the police report. And it's a no go. It's not happening. There's a trial coming up And basically the only way for me to get a copy of that is if I had been a relative of the deceased or if I was a lawyer somehow involved in the case. So... Uh I haven't really tried to track down any of these people around uh this little apartment here. Near the corner where I found the blood. I've just been walking up and down the block here. You can kinda see maybe where they cleaned it up a little bit. But the rest of the blood is gone. It's been cleaned up at this point. So... I hope you can hear me over this... Helicopter. Eh... Anyway so at this point... I haven't found anybody who knows what the fuck happened here uh... I might as well be like the only person other than the police who knows anything about the blood that was over here. Wow. - It's a different world when you wake up early boo. - Well no, it's not about that. - I'm kidding. If you can't tell... Part... the reason I'm making this is... Part of the reason I have so much time on my hands is because... uh... you know I lost my job... several months back... uh... You know it's just... It's tough getting back into the swing of things and... and dealing with... the uh... constant rejection... The world gets you down you know? It's beating down on you every day. And you know... You know that's why uh... doing this project has been sort of like a breath of fresh air for me because... you know... its... given me a little bit of a reason... to wake up in the morning. So you used to work with Tae right? - Yeah. Well, I knew him as Andy. - Okay so how do you feel about his death? And the... - Its... It's terrible. Um its... super tragic... I... it's the last person that I would expect something like that to... you know, to happen to them. - Okay. And so did you know his wife as well? Or? - Yeah. Yeah I did. I had um... I met her a few, a few times. She was kind of quiet... but seemed very sweet. And it seemed like they had a really good relationship overall. And so like what happened? Or why do you think she did it? I don't know man. Shit got really weird right after they moved into that new place a couple months ago. - Okay, and how so? - He... I dunno he just... would have like weird sort of expressions on his face. He seemed like really tired like he wasn't getting a lot of sleep. It seemed like, he didn't say it exactly... but it seemed like they were fighting a lot... which had never happened before. I know moving can be stressful. But it was way more than... than that... Something was wrong.... Okay. Uh, that's two people now that have confirmed... that the murderer was a very nice lady. Something doesn't ring about the idea of a nice woman... just, I dunno, snapping, and killing her husband. I mean, I guess murders happen but... something about it just doesn't add up. - He was uh... and someone put a chair for me because I'm homeless. And he came by and graffiti'd it over and over. And no, I don't know his name. And I asked him "what are you writing?" He wouldn't say. Then he pretends he doesn't speak English. That he only speaks uh... - I'm the property manger, why? - Uh well... Actually, uh... Do you know anything about the murder that happened here? - As far as I'm concerned it's over. - But you don't know about why there was blood on the front of the street or why she was arrested so far back in my alley? - I have no idea about that. Look... You can't keep filming here. I'm gonna have to call the cops cause the tenants keep complaining about you. - I'm not trying to be disrespectful I just have a lot of unanswered questions about this murder. - You're not gonna find anything. - Yeah but... Okay well... - Look, you can't film here. - Well... - Put down the camera and go home. I guess it's just... It took a second for it to really like sink in what this means... But uh... You know... If I'm banned more or less from the property... where the victim was found... Then this investigation is like over. I... you know... it's just... Maybe I should give this fucking thing up and go look for a job. Maybe it's just not right for me. Who would've thought that it would be this hard to just find one person who knows something more... about what happened than we already know. You know, the world's not a fair place. In case you didn't know, okay. So... You know, just cause... you know I deserve a little something from this... from all the the time I've been putting into it. You know, maybe I'm just the world's worst investigator... uh, failure at life... I should just go jump off a fucking bridge. How am I supposed to go on with my life if I don't know about what she was doing in the alley. And... why there was blood on the front of the street. Okay? So now I don't really know what to do and I just wanted to tell you... my confidant uh... in this project... So I just... - I'm sorry. I mean... Maybe it's just time to give it up. Well, what about the blood on the street, you know I still have a lot of unanswered questions. I feel like it's not... going anywhere. And I feel like those things are just... random coincidences... - Yeah we've it been over before. I mean, I know you've been hating on this project since the beginning. It's okay, you can admit it. I don't care. - I just feel like it's not, there's not point. And I just think that you're wasting your time. -Ugh. Okay. Well, maybe I'll just sleep on it. And maybe tomorrow I'll just give it up and start looking for a job. - Is it good luck, or is it bad luck? -I hope it's good luck. I just had the weirdest dream. It was his face. Right in front of me. It was like staring at this picture. And... There was all this writing that was in Korean. And... I have no idea what it said... But it was like... One of the most weird dreams I've ever had. And... I just don't know what to make of it. - The bible says hell is the whole salvation. Hell is the accepted path. Jesus Christ. Son of God. - What you do with Jesus. The call of God is to repent, turn around. Repent, turn around. Believe in the lord Jesus Christ follow righteousness and holiness and you can escape the damnation of hell. If this hasn't already been a weird enough morning... Look at this... I just passed this. And I need to get a shot of it. Okay... Look at this. Now this is going to sound totally crazy but... I feel like this message is written for me because it's... basically identical to what I saw in my dream last night and I would love to know what the fuck this says.... because I am freaking out right now. There's no way it's just a coincidence that I stumble upon this writing that... came to me in a dream. And now it mentions the pastor story. And I happen to see... A street preacher pastor kind of guy... And... Okay... This is already weird enough right? It gets way crazier. Okay. I've seen... this guy... maybe it was one of his friends, I've seen him before. Now look at this. I took this video the morning of the murder. Maybe it's not the same guy. But they're obviously... you know... coordinated. So what the fuck is happening here? - So here's my question. Can you get one of your friends from work to help translate this for me? Please? - You have to give this up, it's, this is insane. - Just get her to come... - I thought you were done with this already. - Well, I said I would sleep on it and I slept on it and a bunch of other shit has happened. So, now I'm not done with it until I get this translated and then maybe I'll be done with it, or I will be done with it. I promise, okay, just ask. All you have to do is ask her. It's gonna be great. Okay so while I've got this downtime waiting for our translator this weekend, if I was gonna prioritize what I need to be doing, looking for somebody who knows about the blood that was on the front street is the most important part of my investigation. So, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna stake it out and I'm gonna find somebody and that's that. - Some... some... blood on his hand, for sure, I saw that. - Okay. - He was like leaning over kinda holding his side and... I saw that. And I was like, "Does this guy need any help?" "Should I be concerned?" I kind of approached him and he just ran off. He didn't want any help. It was weird, man. - Well... Which way did he run? - He ran back that way. - Okay, well. - You all right though? You doing all right, man? - No no no I'm - Look, okay, here's what I don't understand... Cause he was murdered down there and he came, he ran this way? - He did, but uh... - Well, what did he look like? Tell me what the guy looked like. - Well he was an older, he was an older, older, older like Asian guy, probably like 5'6" or whatever, but I'm not sure why.... No no he was... - Why you're asking all that. - No, he was younger. He was a young tall guy and he, are you sure you got a good look at him? - 100% man, but you kind of, you know, you're kind of scaring me a little bit. You're looking kind of, kind of nervous, man. - No, no, no. Just... - Hey, bro, see, I'm trying to help you out but you're kind of, you're coming on a little strong. You want me to call somebody? - Dude I'm doing fine. - You want me to call somebody for you right now? Okay you know what? You don't know what you're talking about You're full of shit, okay, all right. So, as you can see I've been busy trying to work through all the details and I'm just wondering, is it possible that I was wrong about this third person? Could there have been a third person involved? I guess that would really answer a lot of the questions I have here. I was just searching the Internet for this case and Mi-Sun Yoo, who is accused of murdering her husband, she claimed, she said to the police that there was a third person there that broke into their apartment and committed this murder. So, I think now it's almost certain that there was a third person involved in this. This guy, the apartment manager, was so defensive. He definitely fits the description, short Asian guy, older. So, you know, maybe this is like the big break in the case that I've been looking for. Okay, I'm just, I'm keeping my distance. So, I'm not technically near the property but I'm gonna stake this place out for a little bit and see if I can find this apartment manager. Okay well, I'm just going back to my apartment now. It's a waste of time at this point. I'm gonna come back a little bit later in the afternoon and try to catch him when he's coming home from work. Okay so, I just heard back from this guy with some bad news. The old lady at his apartment complex, I won't be meeting with her because I've already met her. Voila, this is the "old lady" who's probably like 40. And then the other bad news is that this apartment manager guy, he's been confirmed now that he was out of town on the night of the murder, so that's double dose of dead ends and that's how my day is going. Look at this weird light, so anyway. Hello? Weird vibe today. So, I don't even know really what I'm gonna do now. And I don't want to put all of my eggs in one basket but I really have a feeling. And it's hard for me to explain really, but I have a feeling like this graffiti is possibly the missing link and maybe there's a piece of evidence in there that's really gonna point me in the right direction. So, we got the translator coming tomorrow and I can't wait to see what she says. I totally spaced that I had seen this graffiti before. On the couch, there's the lady with the couch, the homeless lady. Look at this, like this weird Jesus fish thing. So, I think this is the same guy and we'll try to get this translated as well. So, she didn't tell you about the murder or anything like that? Or...? - No. - Okay so, actually it happened to be at this apartment complex right here. And there's all these like, sort of like weird inconsistencies about like what happened with it. So, I found this graffiti up here that I, and there have been these street preacher kinda guys, and I uh, I don't know. I just feel like it all is, you know, like working together in some way. You know? - Okay. Oh, no, it used to be right there. This is, oh shit. Anyway, I think there's another one that's like just down the block. You're okay if we go check that one out? - Um. Yeah. - Okay cool, all right, oh, man. I'm sorry about that. We walked all the way over here and it's gone. Well, it used to be right there and there was a homeless lady that used to live here, too. And I don't know, hey, you didn't see any, there used to be a couch right here with some like graffiti on it. - What is it? - A couch. - A couch? And a homeless lady that used to live here. - Yeah there used to be a couch over here, what happened? - I don't know what happened to it. - You looking for the couch or you're looking for the lady? - Both actually. Well, we've got her here. She was gonna translate what was written on the couch. Okay, it's been gone? - The lady comes at night time. You find her at night time. - Okay alright. - In the day time, I don't know where she at. - Okay, all, right, well thank you. Anyway, so yeah, this whole month or so has been pretty crazy because I've been looking into what's been going on with this murder and uh... Okay, hold on, oh shit. Okay, wait, there we go, all right. Um... Let's see. - Well, he's talking about a Korean pastor. He's saying let's try to avoid him. - Avoid who though, the pastor? - Yeah, I guess he's just telling everybody to avoid the pastor as much as possible. I mean, he seems kind of not all there, like he's not making any sense. - Okay, there was another one right down here. It's gone of course. Let me just... Okay well... Okay sorry. I just thought that it might still be still under there, but it's not. I have video of that other one. Do you think maybe we could just go, oh sorry. Do you think that maybe we could just go back to the apartment and you can translate maybe from the video? Or, would that be okay? There was another one. - Yeah. - Okay, it's fine? Okay, yeah, let's go back, we'll go back and we'll just, yeah, we'll translate from the video. And I just, I wonder if it was here. Hold on one second. It's so thick, it could be on any of these. Okay, well, pardon the mess. Okay, we'll go back to the apartment and we'll just, we'll go back to the apartment. Okay, all right, let's just go back to the apartment. She's not that happy that I'm still working on this but... Sorry it's taking so long. Okay, this is the one, this is the couch the homeless lady had right next to her. So, what's, what in the hell does it say? - Bungeoppang, bungeoppang is a old Korean dessert. So, she wrote, she drew a little fish. It's a dessert that looks like the shape of a fish. - Well, okay, hold on, there's another. There's another, it's the pastor's story. - Okay, this is insane. The guy is talking about the same pastor again, but this time it seems like he's mentioning other names and they're saying that they're bad men. He's saying that the pastors are bad men. And he kind of just rambles on like none of it makes sense. I think he's, I want to say he's not all there. He might be mentally ill. I'm pretty sure he's homeless. - It's gotta have something to do with what... with what I'm working on. You think? - How? - It's, it's, it's not just a coincidence. This all has, it's all coming to a head somehow. I just have to figure out how. - I think you're reaching and I don't think has... - Okay, well, you don't believe me then... that's two. One, two, I guess we're done. You can go now, I'll go in the bedroom. My fucking girlfriend is gonna kill me, but I feel like, like I have to come back out tonight. I'm telling you, I have a feeling that tonight I'm supposed to go out here and find... the lady with the couch or find the guy who wrote the graffiti or find something at one of these key spots. And I know it's gonna happen. So... Back here at the scene of the crime. Back here where the blood was. No couch, no lady. I seen her fucking every day probably for the past five years and then out of nowhere just the day that I need to find her she's disappeared off the fucking face of the Earth. If I could just find the guy who wrote this fucking graffiti then I could sleep well tonight. But it looks like it's just not happening. Back here in the alley where she was arrested. It's the last stop of the night. Okay, look, I don't like to be sneaking around doing things behind my girlfriend's back but basically I just lied to her and told her that I was giving up my investigation and... I'm not. Because there's something else that's at play here. I'm gonna make a big video tomorrow. Sort of uh, explain something. I just... I had the dream again. I've taken some time to collect my thoughts and I wanted to make a video to come clean about something which might shed light on my behavior lately. I want to explain an aspect of this investigation that I haven't shared yet. You didn't do it to play a trick on me? - Why would I do that? - You promise? - Of course, I wouldn't even think of that. Pay for it, Bobby ain't bothering me. You got it all coming on you. You got it all coming on you. - It's as if something has been trying to communicate with me and it's been giving me a very distinct feeling that I've only had once before in my life when I was a child and my mother died unexpectedly. I woke up in the middle of the night and I knew the moment that she passed. I can't explain how but I felt it. And it's the same feeling that I've been having lately. And it's part of the reason I've been so persistent in my investigation. I haven't felt the same since I first dreamt you, Tae Kyung Sung. I don't even know how to say your name right but I feel such a deep connection to you. So, if it's you that's trying to communicate with me, I choose to communicate back that I'm here to help. But as I'm reaching a dead end, I ask for your help in return, for your blessing to continue and for something that points me in the right direction so I can bring closure for us both. Hey. - Hi, how are you? - Good, do you mind if I film this? - No, go ahead. - I've been doing an investigation into a murder. And it's possible that this guy who was murdered is trying to communicate me, with me from the, from beyond the grave, and I just came for a reading, or for your help if you're able to... - Okay. My reading is $20. - Okay, here's the twenty bucks. So, you're a real psychic? - Yes, I am. - Okay. - I've been reading for 40 years. - Okay, so, can you - Let's see what my cards tell me. - Okay. - You know, what I would advise you is, because this person is trying to contact you from the other side... - So he is? - Is making you feel discomfortable. Sometimes people's minds, okay, work differently, because maybe sometime in your past or sometime in your childhood, maybe you lost somebody, or wanted to be with somebody or was trying to contact somebody and you couldn't and maybe what you feel is that, that is confusing you and troubling you. And maybe you should just let it go and not pursue it further because it might cause you more drama and make you feel more discomfortable in the future. - Well, look, I just, I have to know what the answer to the inconsistencies about this investigation are. Do you know about this stuff, like, what's? - Well, you know son, psychics feel and sometimes know a lot of things. Okay? But sometimes to pursue everything in life is not always the best thing. - Well, what does he want though? - There's no telling what this person wants. - Is there anything I can do to figure that out? Or anything you can do? - Well, you know, son, there are a lot of things that a person could do, but I would suggest to you just to leave it alone. Just leave it alone. Just try to be strong and positive and don't listen to anybody or any voices that tell you to pursue this. - How do I get him to stop if I'm not supposed to go on with this? - You know, son, let me tell you. Sometimes the signs that you see are not put there for you. Maybe you just think that they're there for you and the signs are telling you this, but they're not. I'm suggesting to you, give it up, leave it alone. - Okay well I- - Don't pursue it. - Okay, I'm gonna go. Maybe she's just right. You know... What's fucked up is she clearly knew about my mother dying when I was a kid and that connection that I felt. That this is the same thing I'm feeling right now. I'm just, why can't I, what's wrong with me finding out what's happening around here? I mean, I just want to know what's going on. Okay? Okay now look at this. Okay? How am I supposed to ignore this? Okay? This is clearly written for me. I know that the pastor and the pastors are bad. Okay? I know that the pastors are bad men and I'm supposed to avoid them. I understand the warning, but why? I feel like the reason that this message is here is maybe to get me to come back to the scaffolding and find the person who wrote the graffiti. I'm coming back tonight. I'm gonna stake it out and we're gonna settle this once and for all. This graffiti from earlier, somebody's ripped it down. Is this supposed to be another sign for me? I'm telling you, I have a feeling that tonight I'm supposed to find this guy. I'm supposed to meet him here. Uh. It's happening tonight, it's happening tonight. I think this guy has taken the night off tonight. So... Well, if it's not gonna be the guy who wrote the graffiti then it's gonna be... you know, the person whose blood was out on the side of the street or it's gonna be the lady with the couch who's come back from the dead. Again, the blood. I know I'm not even supposed to be here but the scene of the crime again. Still no couch, still no lady. I'll go to each and every place that I can possibly find anybody tonight and I'm just gonna keep on going back and forth to these spots until I find the person that I'm supposed to meet. Okay? Back here in the alley where she was arrested. You probably can't hear me over these fucking helicopters either. Jesus fucking Christ, go away. Am I supposed to meet you here? - Am I supposed to meet you here? - I don't know, you tell me. - I don't know, you tell me. - Do you know anything about what happened with the murder? - Do you know anything about what happened with the murder? - You're just gonna repeat everything that I say to you? - Yeah. - I think I'm supposed to be here with you. - Time out, are you making a movie? I've been to 'Nam, cut me a break. Jesus Christ, it was a murder? - It was a murder. A woman murdered her husband. - Oh, man, what the fuck is going on? What town is this by the way? - This is Koreatown. - Oh, Koreatown, no wonder. Jesus Christ. A lot of murders happen in Koreatown that people don't even know about. - You were here in this alley the night of the murder? - Hey, buddy, I don't know. I must have been if that was the purple flash was the murder weapon fire discharging. If it was, I don't know for sure. I didn't hear a sound, but I saw the light. But it was purple in color and it was up that way, up into the sky from inside that garage over there. - And it has to do with the murder? - I guess, if that's what you're investigating. But I saw three figures inside the garage during the flash. I got keen eyes. I've been to 'Nam. So listen, buddy, I'm telling you the truth. Do you doubt my word? - No. - Okay, that's important news. Since Cambodia, it's called the People's Outdoor Court. It's as good as in the court of law. - Where did it come from, which garage? - The one back there, one of the, how many of them are? - Will you point it out? Will you point it to me? - Four or five, that one over there. - I can't see anything. Which one was it? - One of them. I don't know which one it was. - His name was Tae Kyung Sung. - Oh, I know that guy, Tae Kyung Sung. I know him personally from overseas. - How'd you meet him? - No, he was one of our group. - I believe that the spirit of the man who was killed has been communicating with me from the other side - Okay. - And leading me toward, The... whatever he wants me to see... - The other side of the poetic wall - Yes, that's true, probably true. Lots of ghosts are like this. They don't even realize they're dead. They don't even know they're dead! - Do you think that we've met here for a reason? - I think more than one reason. I think we're meant to be here together to solve this problem. Do you think I'm going on the right direction here? - The right direction with your investigation? - Yeah. - Oh yeah, I think you're right on target, locked on, ready to fire, as they say in the Air Force. Push the red button and you got them. - Anything else? - It's all coming down on you, buddy. - What's coming down on me? - Well, I heard somebody say that today. That's the only reason I mentioned it. It's almost over. I'm an expert witness. I've been a witness before, especially in Cambodia where we did people's court. In the evening, just before supper. - I can't overstate the significance of last night and there's a lot that went down and a lot to decompress. All of my suspicions have been confirmed, that something else has happened and there's weird shit going on in this neighborhood. You know, I feel validated right now in this pursuit, like this stuff really has been happening for a reason, like I've been chosen for something. Something went down in this alley. Something big went down in this alley. I'm gonna find out what it was. The reason that she was arrested so far back here in the alley is because her garage, this must be her garage up here. I'm just gonna... This is sketchy as fuck, okay well, something, something went down in this garage and I'm almost positive this is her garage. I have to come back tonight and see what's in there. I have to know. Can I do that? Am I gonna get in trouble? I'm almost positive, this has been triangulated that there was a third person here with the blood and whoever it was, was in the garage with the murder victim and the murderer. Who was this third person? I have to do this before my girlfriend gets home. It's not even dark out yet, I don't... Let me get, hold on, I have to turn this flash off. It's too bright, okay. Oh shit. Okay, there's people up there. This is too sketchy. I... There's no way I'm breaking into this garage tonight. I'm done filming for the night. My girlfriend will be home any minute. I need to go in the garage But I'm gonna do through the proper channel. So, I put in a search with the city for the property owner's information. So, I can just contact the landlord of this place. It will be a couple days so I asked this guy, Jack, maybe he can give me the information faster. And if not, there's one other thing that I really need to get done right now, which is I just realized, so this guy, the guy from the alley, I talked to him for hours and I forgot to ask him one of the most important questions which is if he knows anything about the pastors. And it's really weird it just kinda like slipped my mind. And I'm almost sure that he lives in one of the alleys adjacent to this, to my alley. So, I'm gonna go find this guy and ask him a couple more questions. I don't know where he goes when it rains. Yes. - It is? - Yeah. - How's it going, my friend? - Is it still raining? - No, it stopped raining. - Yeah, I remember now, you were talking to me about your girlfriend being murdered or something like that. - Well, it was about my neighbor's murder... - Oh man, it's a wicked town, man, it happens. - Well, so but, I just, there are two things so... Well, first of all, you really saw the three people in the garage? - I told you the truth about what I witnessed, sir. - Okay, so you weren't just liquored up or something? - No, I'm... - You really saw it? - I was wide awake. I saw what I saw and I told you what I saw. - Okay, well, do you know anything about the pastors? By the way, that's the reason... - Pastors, I never met a pastor. I haven't met a pastor. - Okay, so you don't know anything about that? - I've met preachers but I haven't met a pastor. - - It's a little bit... - Nobody with a official hat on. - Okay, it's too crazy for me to really tell you about if you don't know already. - I just don't know about it. - I just had a repeat of the same dream and this time, this is gonna sound so weird, he reached out and he grabbed my arm. And now, look at this. You see that? It looks like a burn or something. Okay, this is new. I am getting a really weird vibe today and I don't like it. You know, this is making me nervous. I feel like these guys are following me around and I already know that they're bad men and to avoid them, so I'm just gonna turn around and walk the other way. I just have this very weird paranoid feeling right now like something is out to get me. See, they are, they're following me around. Okay? I almost wanna just go up to the guy, ask him what the fuck he wants from me. I just want to know who they are, what they want from me and what they have to do with the murder. You see this from earlier? You see this reflection? It's like the next level of weird shit going on. Look at this. They all look at me at the same time. Okay, one more time. What the fuck? Great so now we got chicken sacrifices. Just a beautiful day in the neighborhood where people have been sacrificing chickens apparently. Everything is fine in Koreatown right now. Everything is peachy keen. This is horrible, oh my God. The guy who I interviewed... uh the actor who just moved here from Florida... he killed himself. Does this look like the kind of guy who kills himself? I feel horrible. I feel like this is my fault. Burn update. It's not getting any better. This I don't like at all. I just want to fucking... one second. So, the landlord of their apartment building lives in the building behind me, this building right here which he also owns. And he has a store in Koreatown as well. And I'm gonna go there right now and ask him some questions. What the fuck is this place? - Hello? - Hi. - Yeah, are you the landlord of 1100 Menlo Avenue? - Yes. - Yeah, I have some questions because I'm doing an investigation into the murder that happened at your apartment complex and the suicide that just occurred a couple days ago. - Excuse me, what this? - Uh, it's a... - What's that camera? - Okay look. I'm not filming you. There's something fucking weird going on in your apartment complex and I have information to believe that it all is centered in a garage. Do I have your permission to enter the garage? - Please. - Okay, do I have your permission to enter the garage? - No, no, please, please leave. - Why not? Why can't I enter the garage? - Because I know nothing about that issues. - Okay, well you don't think it's weird that people have been dying at your apartment complex? - I'm asking you to put the camera down. - Okay, I'm putting it down but why can't I go into the garage? Give me a clear answer. - I don't know, just, I don't like to... I don't like you to be involved in this anymore. - But why don't you want me to be involved in it? I just have to know the truth. Okay? Just tell me, where were you on the night of the murder? Okay? You fit the description of this third man who was in the garage with the murder victim and his wife. - Okay, I need to call up the police. - Okay, well, call the police and bring them here and then we're gonna go to the garage and we're gonna find whatever evidence is in there. - You're bothering my business. Okay? - Yeah, there's nobody in here except for her and who the fuck is that fuck is that, by the way? Huh? - Please, I am asking you to leave. - Okay... - Please leave. This guy is one of them, this guy is one of them. He is one of them, he is one of them. - Are you one of the pastors? - Get out. Get out. Where were you on the night of the murder? - I'm asking you to get out, okay, just get out. - This guy is one of the pastors! It's a cult or something, it's a cult, it's a cult! Fuck. I know he's hiding something in the garage. I know he was there on the night of the murder. This guy might as well be the fucking ring leader of this organization or whatever the fuck it is. This is what I'm worried about. Okay? It's possible that I've been misinterpreting this whole thing and the man who was killed, that he has been warning me this whole time and either the guy who was murdered wants me to go to the garage and find out what's in there and expose the truth so that way no one else is hurt or it's like I'm being lured into a trap. Okay? It's the middle of the night. I don't want to wake up my girlfriend but, that's gotta be the landlord's apartment building. Something really fucking crazy is going on in this neighborhood. I think that I've figured out a pattern here and it's not good and it all has to do with how I found out about this. Okay, so, I had the dream. I saw the graffiti. I saw the pastor and the lady with the couch went missing. Okay, let's fast forward a couple days ago. I had the dream with the burn. I saw this Satanic graffiti. I saw the pastor and this guy kills himself. Okay? It's the time in the middle that is a little bit off with this pattern. I don't know if anybody died that night, but I had the dream, I saw the graffiti, and who did I see that night? Who told me about the purple light? And who led me toward investigating the garage? Okay? Do you get where I'm going here? I have to know. Hey, Now I'm gonna ask you a question and I want a truthful answer from you. Are you one of the pastors? - Yes. - Leave me alone. - I will. - Don't talk to me anymore. I don't want to see you in my alley. I should have known from the beginning and I am just way in over my head right now and I am just fucked is what I am. I don't even know what I'm gonna do now. I feel like there are two factions fighting for control over my mind. And this investigation has to end right now. This is my last video. I don't give a fuck what's in the garage. I'm never going back to that alley again. Thanks for watching. I can't sleep. I just... need to stand here and watch over her. I feel like if I don't then something horrible is gonna happen. Like they're going to come get her or something. I'm spending some quality time with her this weekend. And I'm going to ignore this investigation. And unless Tae Kyung Sung shows me a true proper sign then this investigation is still over. My relationship is in shambles. My life is in shambles. And I need this to end. I'm done. Hold on a sec. Holy shit. What's wrong with you? - No look we have to go right now okay? Why? I'm waiting for my food. Wait why? - We're not safe here. - What's wrong with you? - Okay fine I'll meet you out front. I haven't really finished my investigation. Wait, no no no. Just stop, I haven't been completely honest with you. And I have to show you I haven't... - No. Stop. Just stop filming. Stop filming this. Somebody else has to see this because I'm not... No, you do care. Okay? Because it has to do with our safety. And what I've seen tonight with one of the pastors... - No. Stop filming me... - Means that something bad Is gonna happen tonight... - No. Stop... And I'm the only one who can stop it. Okay? - No. Stop filming. Stop filming me. - The spirit of the guy who was murdered has been communicating with me and his presence is here right now and I can feel it. Okay? And I have been chosen to stop whatever bad is supposed to happen tonight from happening. Okay? Do you... No. No, just, you've gone insane. He's here. Tae Kyung Sung. If this is you and you're trying to communicate with me show me a sign. Whoa. Are you seeing this? Do you believe me now? Do you want me to go to the garage? Is there a piece of evidence there for me to find? I have to break in there... - Please don't go. I have to go. Hey buddy... Come on over. Hey everybody check it out man, I'm talking to the rats. Don't worry I can hear you. You're sloshing your feet too. Must be wet up there. Hey buddy down here. Why don't you come down here and join us? Stay out of trouble for a while, warm your cockles. Look buddy I got some really good news for you. You're this close to nabbing the crook. Hey I know what, let's talk a walk upstream a bit. Look there goes a couple of rats. Hi Suzie... Anyway uh yeah, let's walk up the shelf a little bit. Hobo's hit your row. Why don't you break into that garage over there? You might find something that'll help you. It's the perfect time, it's raining. They'll never know. They won't even see fingerprints if it's raining. Go to the garage. Break the lock. Open the door. Go inside. Make sure you collect the evidence you need and then get out of there. And then it's sealed. For your humanity's sake... Do it. Do what we recommend. We don't mean to tell you what to do like a 'straw boss'. But please, take our advice. It's King Kong crying over your dead soul if you don't do it. I'm going to pass out. Okay I just woke up and I have a huge fucking problem which is that And I don't know where my girlfriend is. I don't remember exactly what happened last night but... I think that she's mad at me at she's... left. Something fucking bad happened... Something really bad fucking happened and I don't know what to do. It's just really not like her and she won't answer my calls and... I don't know what the fuck happened last night. All I know is... I heard that wretched voice coming from the sewer. Where is she? Are you down there still? Hello? - Hey it's Jen, leave a message or send me a text. Bye. I feel like I saw the landlord in the garage and he assaulted me. So as soon as it stops raining I'm gonna go pay this guy a fucking visit. Look at this... Do you see this crack... Hold on let me turn on the light here. Do you see this in my ceiling? This crack in my ceiling!? This doesn't make any sense. Okay. At 10:08 is when I recorded the video of my encounter with the landlord in there. And then at 11:09 I left the garage, I ran out of the garage... What the fuck happened to me in there for an hour? Okay? What did he do to me? Hello? Uh who are you? I'm John. - Uh yeah I'm looking for the landlord who I saw last night in the garage before my fucking girlfriend went missing! - Last night happened something very bad. - Uh yeah well where's the landlord? He's... he's dead. - How? -I don't know, maybe a suicide. - He's not in here? - No, he's not here now. Do you know what's going on in this neighborhood with the pastors or any of this other bullshit? - I don't know. It's okay? - No it's not okay. Okay? He's really dead? - Yeah he's really dead. The feeling I had with him is gone. And all I feel now... is nothing. - Hello? - Can I help you? - Yeah my name is Sam, I'm a friend of Jen's. I just wanna... come in and talk to you for a second. - Do you know where she is? - I don't that's why I want to talk. - Uh... How do you know her? - I'm a family friend. - Look if you don't know where she is then there's nothing you can do to help. - Open the door please. Her fucking family thinks I've done something to her. I haven't done anything to her. I don't know what happened okay? I don't know where she is. What the fuck am I going to do? - Fuck. He's coming upstairs. Okay. Here we are going to file a missing persons report for my girlfriend at the request of the police. Well the police think that I'm crazy. Uh yes, there's some weird supernatural occurrences going on and my fucking girlfriend has gone missing. What do you think the first thing that comes out of their mouth is? Well where were you? What were you doing? Surely there's gotta be somebody in this town who can help me with this problem somebody who knows something more about the pastors somebody who can help me find my girlfriend. - Stay away. Stay away. - Just, I can't give you a reading there's nothing I can do! I can't sleep. I'm going right now to try to find the guy from the alley and when I find him, I'm going to do this to him I'm gonna go smash his fucking face in. Okay great now this guy has gone missing too. The guy from the alley is now officially missing because this is where he used to live before he started talking to me from the sewer Now look at this. Okay this alley is blocked off by a bunch of rubbage. How is this possible? - Hallelujah! Holy shit. Hey! - I don't know what to do. I almost forgot she was gone. The police are out to get me. Like what the fuck do you do when the police are out to get you? They're searching my garage. She's not in there, I already checked. I know she's not fucking in there. The next logical conclusion they're going to come fucking arrest me. I'm so fucked here. Holy shit I'm fucked. The only thing I can do is try to find the guy from the alley again. He's the only person who knows anything about what's going on here. If I can't find the guy from the alley, I'm going back to my apartment and I'm going to go hang myself before the police arrest me. - I hear you coming. - Hello? Come on buddy get over here. - How do I get to the other side? What do you want from me? - I don't want anything from you, not me. - Well who does? - You got any beans? Refried beans? - How do I get my girlfriend back? - How about a tank of propane? - How do I get my girlfriend back? - You might have to wait another lifetime. - How do I get her back? - Get her back? You can't bring back the dead. Are you some kind of saint? - Who says she's dead? - I didn't say so... - I didn't do anything to her - Any of you rats so so? We didn't say so. We ain't accusing you of nothing. We're the people's court. We're fair and just. - How did you get down there? - We're not... You're accused of murdering someone though. Or so we hear... - How did you get down there? - I come down a secret passage. My own passage. Everyone has their own separate rabbit hole you know. - How did you get into the sewer the other night? - Well you're here now. How did you get down? Through the manhole? Did you do something to her? - I didn't do anything to her. - Do you know about what happened to her? - I've been down here for months. - What is happening? - I'm just withering down here. - What happened to me in the garage? - What happened to you in the garage? - When I went to the garage. - Oh... - I saw a glow that lasted for a minute. A purple glow coming from the window. So maybe you killed her maybe you didn't. Maybe you killed her in an absent minded state. - I didn't kill anybody, I'm innocent. - Well that's what you remember... Maybe you did it in an absent minded state. I think you did it though. I think you did it. Cause you were in that place and anyone who... Even an innocent person is guilty once they're in there of killing someone close to themselves. There's a long history of that place, that particular garage is haunted somehow it's cursed even, that people who go in there commit murder. They could give you time they could give you life if they really wanted to. You stay here we'll give you free life. You wanna stay? Stay outta trouble? Stay with us. - You're guilty bud. You're guilty as charged. Unless you present evidence to the contrary. - I didn't do anything what are you talking about? What do you want from me? - Just do what we recommend, we're doctors. Doctor's recommendation: go to the garage... and find the evidence you need. This garage is haunted! It's run by the pastors! It's a portal to hell! People are talking to me from the sewers! There's a portal to hell in my neighbor's garage! It's cursed, run by the pastors! They talk to me from the sewers! My girlfriend's gone missing! My neighbor's garage is cursed! There's a portal to hell inside! It's run by the pastors! They talk to me from the sewers! Now my girlfriend's gone missing! I didn't kill her! What do you want from me? What do you want from me? What do you want from me? What do you want from me? It has become clear that I have traveled to a new distant world. And I am rapidly approaching the end of my investigation into into the murder of Tae Kyung Sung. There is no one left to help me. And it's only a matter of time before the police arrest me. My only recourse is to present the evidence as clearly as possible. This will be my last video. When I'm finished, I will ship the footage to a friend along with my notes. Because if this information doesn't get out... More people will go missing... And more people will die. I have discovered a series of pictures on my phone which I do not remember taking. Pictures that helped me crack the case. At the end of this recording I will share them. But first... I'll take one last walk to those familiar places. Back to their apartment where Tae Kyung Sung's body was found. The man who communicated with me from another world... maybe the one I'm in now. You touched me and I felt you. But I'm afraid I felt something that wasn't true. I'm now confident that his only communications were warnings. Like the burn on my arm Where he reached out... with whatever last bit of energy he had left in his former world. In a last ditch effort to save me. And everything I felt after that like the wind blowing in bathroom the night I was lured into the garage wasn't coming from him at all it was coming from the pastors or maybe the garage itself. Back to the scaffolding where I found the graffiti. Where I was surprised to learn that all those messages were most likely written by the landlord even after he was dead. Which seems impossible but not here. He prayed on my curiosity Knowing that I would take the bait his shiny shoes gave him away. I believe he brought the shopkeeper and the shopkeepers mother from Africa to be sacrificed next. I want to believe that I saved them. Back to where I found the blood on the front of the street. The landlord's blood. Also known as the mysterious 3rd man. Who after a skirmish with Tae Sung and his wife in their apartment Stopped to check on his wound spewed his blood then ran home. Back to the alley where she was arrested. Where the pastor spoke to me from the sewer. Where she ran after realizing what had happened. And finally... Back to the garage. Where there exists some sort of evil entity or portal to hell or new dimension where your worst fears come true. Speculating about it is pointless. It is impossible to understand because it is an illogical hateful place. But I am certain that there are more of these places. And more pastors who tend to them as part of a supernatural cult. To enter alone is not enough. I believe a pastor must be present for the ritual or whatever it is, to occur. The landlord served this function on the night of Tae Kyung Sung's murder But the couple fought back because they were strong... much stronger than me. But not strong enough to fend off the pastor's spell which caused Misun Yoo to stab her husband. Apparently in an absent minded state. But not without stabbing the landlord first. So now I'll take one last trip back to those familiar places. Back to where his body as found. Back to where I found the blood on the front street. Back to the alley where she was arrested. And back to the garage. Armed with new regretful knowledge. The evidence that helped me crack the case. The pictures on my phone which I don't remember taking. And now I know the truth of what happened to Tae Kyung Sung... and my girlfriend.
