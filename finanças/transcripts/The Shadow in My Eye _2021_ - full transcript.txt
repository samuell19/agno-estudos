NETFLIX PRESENTS "I'LL NEVER FORGET THE SCREAMS UTTERED WHEN THE BOMB HIT THE SITE THE SCHOOL DARK FROM BEING SHUTTERED CHILDREN CRYING OUT OF FRIGHT" Early on in 1945, the resistance had repeatedly asked the British to bomb the Gestapo HQ at the Shell House in Copenhagen. The RAF hesitated. Captured members of the resistance were kept under the roof as human shields. However, in March, Gestapo were so close to unraveling the resistance that a decision was made to attack. [boy whistling] JUTLAND, FEBRUARY 1945 [laughing] - There's a run, Mom. - [indistinct chattering] Oh. - [woman] We can use the nail polish. - [women laughing] - [chattering and laughing] - The cab's here. - Here, hold the newspaper over your head. - Yeah.

My mom said two men came by. - Can I stay here just a bit? - [man] Here? - Please, Frede. - Now? No. Are you mad? - Why not? - You can't, Svend. You have to go. They'll kill me. I... I can't help you. Do you understand? I can't. Have you talked to Petersen? I can't find him. [loud bang] I'd go to the Shell House. - I'll meet you there later. - The Shell House? Yeah. - I'll do that. - Good. [Svend] Frede? I owe you ten kroner. Goodbye. Are you going to sit here in that bloody uniform? Oh, come on, it's only a white shirt. [father] Why do we live with vermin? Well, tell me. Shame on you. Shame. Did you have a good day, Grandma? That there is not your son. The son you gave birth to isn't here anymore. Where did he go?

Eva! Dad, it's Eva from my class. [in English] Eva, it's me, Greta. Eva! Eva! - [man] Who do you think that was? - [man 2] A bloody snitch. He knew too much. [crowd clamoring] Did he know too much, Mom? Was it because he knew too much? [mother] Come on. Come along. Sweetie, there's nothing there. Henry, we'll be late. We'll be... Come on, let's go! Hen... Henry! Henry! [groans] [panting] So, Henry, you stubborn little lad. We can't go anywhere. The worst part is his voice. What a mess, huh, Henry? You should answer your mother when she asks you a question. I'm sure you understand that if you don't say anything, then you make her nervous. And then you can't tell us what's wrong either. What was it you saw? - Well? - [whimpers] What did you see? [whimpering] [mumbling] Was it the people in the car? [Henry mumbling] I don't get a word. [Henry mumbling] [shouting] Say something, goddamn it, Henry! Speak! Say something! Get it together! Be a man and not a measly, little wimp! [normal] That may seem harsh, but sometimes the children benefit from being scared stiff. Can you say something now, Henry, huh? [Henry whimpers] - Can you say something now? Well? - [sobs] - [doctor] Apparently not. - [mother] I've been thinking. I have a sister in Copenhagen. There isn't much sky there, and it's mainly the sky he's afraid of. [doctor] So, you get rewarded with a trip to Copenhagen for acting like a sissy. Well, well. Good luck with that then. [airplane engine roars] [navigator] I was invited to my sister's school to tell them about our squadron. So I told 'em, "One day on a mission, out of the clouds this Fokker appears." Right? [imitates engine droning] The kids start giggling. I say, "We shoot one of 'em down. All of a sudden... [exhales sharply] ...Fokker appears from behind us, right?" Now the kids start really laughing. All of a sudden, the teacher angrily interrupts me, goes... [imitates woman's voice] "I should make it clear that Fokker is the name of a German aircraft." But I was like, "That's true. That's true. - These fuckers were Messerschmitts." - [laughing] Gentlemen, a quick word prior to the briefing. - [exhales] You're on 977, right? - [both] Yes, sir. This is, uh, Major Truelsen of the Danish SOE. He has some intelligence he wants to share with you. You were on a ranger mission over Jutland a couple of weeks ago with Brown and Smith? - Uh, yes, sir. - Yes, sir. According to their report, they hit a German staff vehicle north of Hobro. Yes, sir. We have received a telegram from the local resistance group. It wasn't a staff vehicle. It was a taxi with a wedding party. A driver and three young women. We urge all pilots to be more thorough next time. Yes, sir. All right. I'll see you at the briefing, chaps. [pilot] It could've been us... But it wasn't. So come on, Reggie. [executioner] Let me tell you how this is gonna go. I'll ask you a question, and if you don't answer, I'll ask if you're ready. [inhales] And then I'll flog you. Shall we proceed? - I don't know anything. I am just... - No, you're just small fry. - Correct. I'm just small fry. - You're not a small fry. You're a maggot. A little maggot man. [chuckles] Take off your shirt. Straddle the chair with your hands up. [prisoner] If you say so. [executioner] Believe me, you'll talk. You all do. You might think this looks harmless, and you'll even think you can bear the pain after the first blow. But you can't. The next blow will be unbearable. We know you're a leading figure. - Which of these people do you work with? - [officer typing] Truelsen, Schoch, Bork-Andersen, Lippmann, Tiemroth? I know Andersen. He's my local butcher. [chuckles] Ready? - [grunts] - [shouts] [groans] [moans] - So tell me where do you usually meet? - [exhales] I don't know... Ready? - [exhales] - [both shout] [yells] [groans] [exhales] - Try to embrace it. - [exhales] [executioner] It makes it much easier. [panting] What's the chain of command between SOE and the Freedom Council? - Ready? - [gasps] [shouts] [exhales] [groans] [panting] What? - [prisoner] Your... - I can't hear you. Your... your time is up, you goddamn traitor. [yells] You don't hit me when I'm not ready, damn it! First you ask the question, then you ask me if I'm ready, and then you hit me! That was the deal! [grunts] - [gasps, shouts] - Damned subhuman! [whispering] What is going on? What is he doing? Come here. Come and listen. What are you doing? Get away from the door. [sister shudders] [gasps] [whimpers] [gasps] A FREE DENMARK [continues gasping] [knock on door] [sister] Sister Teresa. Sister Teresa. [panting] Yeah. [sister] The prioress wants to talk to you. [sisters laughing] [laughing stops] [chattering] They say you flog yourself. We're not 15th-century Jesuits. We're St. Joseph sisters. What good will it do? [sister] Say something, girl. [whispers] I'm searching for God. Pardon. I'm searching for God. Why would he appear before you just because you flog yourself? If it's a sin, he'll punish me, and then I'll know he sees me. [sister] God doesn't care about your pain. Teresa, God is everywhere. But he can't be. With everything that's happening. Does God really not care at all about us humans? [prioress] God loves us humans. Aren't Jews human then? Maybe it's because the Jews don't believe Christ is the son of God. So they're punished with death? [inhales] And the children being bombed in London and Berlin? And the ones who are taken to camps and killed? [sister] We don't know anything about that. [Teresa] Aren't they human? Teresa, God is both in you... and in those who suffer. He can't ease their suffering. - But he can offer them comfort. - [sniffles] [sobbing] And what if they lose their faith? Then they have nothing left. [blubbers] True. Then they have nothing left. [in French] I'm the beautiful Elizabeth of Thuringia. There is famine and distress in this world. [mother in English] Yes, of course. [mother 2] It's so hard now. Yes, but they say it will be over soon. - [mother 2] Yes. - [mother] But poor Henry. [mother 2] Mm-hmm. The worst thing for him is big spaces with the open sky. [mother] Yes, I can imagine. [mother 2] You have to drag him across. [mother] He'll be fine here. [mother 2] It's so sweet of you. [mother] Of course. It's the least we can do. - Hey. - Not so fast. Say hello to your Aunt Anna. Good morning, Rigmor. Did you sleep well? - [Rigmor] Mm-hmm. - [mother] Hmm. Is it because you saw the dead people in the burning car? Is that why you don't speak? [mother] Rigmor, we only talk about happy things, remember? This here is Wolle. Some teddies think it's childish when children want to hug all the time. But Wolle is fine with it. - [Anna] I have a train to catch. - [mother] Yes. [Anna] The notepad. Do make him use it. It's a big help. [mother] Of course. My darling boy, you'll have such a good stay here. Have fun now, all right? Do you promise to look after Henry, also at school? [mother] I've talked to the sisters. They're looking forward to having him. Then I'll see you in a month, right? - [Henry sobs, sniffles] - Farewell. Remember to say something. - [mother] Well, you have a train to catch. - Yeah. [sniffles] [pilots chattering] [man] Attention, please. Operation Carthage is the name of our perhaps riskiest mission yet. At 450 km/h, we will fly at roof altitude straight into the very heart of a capital city, and we will hit and destroy one single building. The target is the Gestapo headquarters of Copenhagen. [taps map] The Shell House. Our aim is to destroy their archives and kill as many Huns as possible. To avoid radars, we will fly low across the North Sea escorted by 30 Mustangs. We will cross over Jutland towards Zealand, and here at Lake Tissø... [taps map] we will divide into three groups. The first group heads directly to Copenhagen. The second group circles the lake once, the third group twice, thus separating us. We shall strike late in the morning, which is the busiest hour, and therefore providing us with the highest kill ratio. And we will be armed with delay-action bombs set at 30 seconds from impact. Now, the Gestapo will be expecting us. And therefore, they have unfortunately positioned 30 prisoners of the Danish resistance immediately below the roof to serve as a form of human shield. I give the word to Special Operations Executive Major Truelsen. [pilots murmuring] [Truelsen] Gentlemen, gentlemen! The Gestapo is dangerously close to eradicating the Danish resistance. That's why the leaders have been begging us for several months now to perform this attack, even if it means the death of our comrades. We need to do this. To sacrifice the few in order to save the many. [big band music playing] [Rigmor] Goodbye, Mom. Bye, honey. - Goodbye, Henry. - [door closes] Eva saw someone die too. He was shot right in the head. But you can still speak, right, Eva? You must say something to speak. What should I say? See? She can speak although she saw a person die. Try. Just say something. [mumbling] - It doesn't matter. - [Henry sniffles] Maybe it's a lump in your throat. - Maybe a bun would help? - Oh, no. - [sniffles] - Come on. This is dangerous. The only problem is, the really frightening thing is, that in there lives the Pig Lady. [Pig Lady breathing ragged] [Rigmor] And inside the Pig Lady lives the Witch of Death. Her pointy fingers are made from the bones of dead children. But it gets worse. Her eyes can burn holes, so don't look her in the eye. Ever! And it gets even worse. - The worst thing is... - The buns are poisoned. [both] One bite and you'll die! - [Rigmor] Let's go. - [bell rings] [ragged breathing] [Rigmor whispering] And now you might ask what we're going to do with a deadly bun. [Eva] Rigmor has an antidote. [ragged breathing continues] [gasps] Look here, Henry. Here comes the hard part. [Eva] Yes. [Rigmor] This is a very wide street with a lot of sky. [Eva] It's a very big street. Here's what we'll do. I'll tie the clothesline around you. - And pull it and you just follow me. - [Eva] Yes. - And then we'll get to the other side. - Mm-hmm. Eva will be right behind you. - Come on, Henry. Come on. - [Henry grunts] Come on. Eva, push! - [Eva] I'm pushing. - Come on, Henry. - We're almost there. - [Henry gasps] - [Rigmor] You have nothing to fear. - [Henry panting] [Rigmor] Come on, Henry. Eva, push. [gasps] [Rigmor] Come on. You can do it! [Eva, singsong] Come on, come on! Come on, come on, come on, come on. - Come on! - [Eva] Come on, come on. - [grunts] - [Rigmor] You made it! Yes, you made it. And tomorrow, you'll do it without the line. Yeah. - [whispering] No! It's poisoned! - Are you insane? You have to dip it three times. And then you salute Jesus. And then you eat. We survived! [laughs] [chuckles] HOORAY! [Rigmor and Eva] Hurrah! There you are. It's excursion time. Come on. This is cousin Henry. He can't speak. [sister] Oh, right. Welcome, Henry. [bell tolling] - [officers shouting] - [officer] Come back here! - [shouting continues] - [prisoner] Get away from me! [officer] Hold him down. - [shouting] - [grunting] Can I help you? [panting] [shuddering] You're the devil. [whispers] Unless you find God, you'll burn in hell. What? Teresa! What on earth are you thinking, girl? [exhales] [prisoner grunts] - [prisoners shouting] - [prisoner groans] [prisoner 2] Let me out! [prisoner 3] Traitor! Damned HIPO bastard! [officer] Come on, Frede. Hello. [sighs] - [prisoner groaning] - [knocks] [prisoner 2] Hello. [prisoner] Hello. [groans] Where are we? Are we in prison? We're in the Shell House. [prisoner] The Shell House? We walked up the stairs right below the roof. [prisoner 2] Below the roof. Below the roof, right. [prisoner 2] We're in the cells below the roof. Below the roof. The Shell House. [grunts] How many of us? I don't know. Thirty, perhaps. Forty. Hopefully, we'll soon be transferred to Vestre. No. [prisoner 2] No? We're their human shield. We're going to be attacked. The Brits? [coughs] Mm-hmm. - [prisoner 2] Do you think they'll come? - Yes. So we're expendable? [prisoner] Yes. Hmm. But... but how can you be sure? [prisoner] I was there when we made the decision. - That the Royal Air Force should bomb? - [prisoner] Yes. And now you're imprisoned here too? [prisoner] Yes, it is rather odd. Absurd. [prisoner] Yes. Absurd. [airplane engine droning] [Frederik] You! Stop. Turn around. Move along. What do you want? Well? The other day, you said something. That thing about God. I don't know what it means. - And besides, it's too late. - What's too late? The war's over. I'm a dead man. How I pity you. - [scoffs] I'm not asking for your pity. - Then what do you want? Weren't you the one who said I should find that guy? - That guy doesn't like black uniforms. - And isn't yours black too? Well, maybe God doesn't like sanctimonious virgins either who shut themselves off from the real world. - I shouldn't be talking to a HIPO traitor. - [scoffs] I'm missing the halo. I'm the devil. Kiss me. [Frederik] What? If I kiss someone like you, God will punish me, and I'll know he exists. Kiss me. No. [both gasp] Well, hey. No, I wasn't struck by lightning. God doesn't exist. Move along. [sister] As you know, this year's play is about Elizabeth of Thuringia. She lived in 13th-century Germany. Although Elizabeth was of royal descent, she did her utmost to help the poor. But then what happened? Yes, Greta. The rich, evil Jews didn't like that she helped the people. One day she came with a basket of bread. - And the rich, evil Jews stopped her. - Well, I don't think they were Jews. But apart from that, you're right. What happened when they asked her to reveal the contents of her basket? Yes, Rigmor. It was transformed into roses. [sister] God worked a miracle. To help Elizabeth hide the bread, he transformed it into roses. - [knock on door] - Yes. Sister Hanna, do you have a moment? Teresa, will you take over the class? [Teresa] Yes, Rigmor. But how could it be turned into flowers? That's what a miracle is. There are many stories about statues of the Virgin Mary that suddenly come alive and weep. In Civitavecchia, in Italy, she sometimes weeps... [sobs] blood. - [cries] - [students laughing] Other Madonnas are even said to speak. - [speaking gibberish] - [students laughing] [chuckles] But how? Because God can do anything. Always? Yes. Well, even when he's asleep? God never sleeps. Then how does he stay awake? Well, sometimes on rare occasions, something might distract him. And then Sister Teresa told us to drop a pencil. So we did it of course. It fell to the floor, and then she said to pick it up. Then Sister Teresa said that God's hours and minutes are different than ours. [Teresa] See? That took about three seconds. Three seconds where you didn't look at me because you were looking at the pencil. Because God's hours and minutes are different from ours, one day for God is the same as maybe a hundred years. Or a second for God is the same as one year. So if you look away for just a few seconds, then he may be gone. So if God, he drops a pencil, he looks away, and then he's gone for two years. Okay. And that's what Sister Teresa said? Mm-hmm. So what I'm thinking is if we're really unfortunate, God is taking a nap right now, all of our lifetime. That may last a hundred years. If it's a long nap, maybe even longer. [father laughs] - [Teresa yawning] - [students laughing] [Hanna] Teresa! What was that? What just happened? Looks like those muscles are starting to move a little. - Was that a smile? - [chuckles] So you can smile. [chuckles] Mm-hmm. - [laughs] Yeah, that's right. - [all laughing] [Rigmor] Hey! What does it say? What does it say? Me? If anybody here is nuts, it's you for sure. You're definitely nuts, right? Yeah, yeah. [Rigmor] I am a nun from Hawaii called Henry. [big band music playing] - I'm very fond of my niece Rigmor. - [all laughing] [Rigmor] She's sweet and bright. Her parents are also very sweet because they say the war will end soon. That's very fortunate because God has gone out for cigarettes. [laughing] - That's good. Great! - Bravo! [parents] Encore! Encore! [Rigmor] If you want an encore, you can have this. Henry, try to keep up. My name is Henry. [laughing] [Rigmor] I can't speak, but if me and Rigmor can have another cake, then I'll speak again. - No, no, you don't. Off to bed. [chuckles] - Oh. - Bravo! - That was so good. [Frederik] Sister. [Teresa gasps] [gasps] What is it? - Did you kiss me because I'm the devil? - Yes. I don't want to be him anymore. [Teresa huffs] Sister! Teach me to pray. [Teresa whispering] Here. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed... Read. I can't read. Repeat after me. Hail Mary, full of grace. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women... Blessed art thou amongst women... ...and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. ...and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. [Teresa] Again. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. If you want to kiss the devil, it ought to be here. No. No, you can't do that. Not in here. - Stop! No, stop! - [panting] [Teresa] Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! [gasps] [panting] He spoke to us. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm a pig. My name is Frederik. [Teresa] Teresa. Are you all right? Yeah. - [clicks] - [engine turns over] [Reggie] There's our escort. That is fucking beautiful. [pilot] Tell them to watch out for seagulls. Watch out for seagulls, lads. - I can't. - [father] Yes, you can. I won't. Stop that and finish your breakfast. I feel sick. There's nothing wrong with you. I'm not hungry. You'll be hungry in a minute. The moment you leave, you will be. - You can't go to school starving. - I don't like it. Did you hear the one about picky Mads? He wouldn't eat either. Oh, no. And the fourth day almost finished him. He was all skin and bones. And on the fifth day, Mads was dead because he didn't eat his bread. Dead. Now you eat up! Fine, off you go on an empty stomach. The porridge will be waiting for you. Then you will have cold porridge, young lady! [Eva] Wait! Wait for me! [sobs, sniffles] - What's the matter? - [sniffling] Nothing. - [pilot grunting] - [gasping] Christ! [grunts] - [grunts] - [groans] [panting] - Where's Frederik? - Haven't seen him for two days. - I don't know how the Corps will react. - [mother sobbing] But I'm done. [father] My son. When we're liberated, you're a dead man. [mother sobbing] [father] Goodbye, my boy. [mother sobbing] Time estimate to target? [Reggie] Approx seven minutes. [screams] [gasping] Whoops-a-daisy.
