It's been a while... it's good to see you! - You too. - Thank-you! There she is! You look beautiful darling. They're here! You ready? Okay, let's go. Hi, David, how are you? Welcome home! Welcome home! Ahi, just like old times. Yeah! Oh, man. Oh. Let me try again. Who knows? We might get lucky. Tch! Nope! I can't reach her. Look, maybe she got caught up in something. That is obviously more important than her only son's welcome home party. Hmm. Things look the same but... they feel different man. You'll be fine. Will I? All you need to do is adjust, and then everything will return back to normal. When you've been in there, you are no longer the same man. Not to mention that people look at you differently. I don't. And, neither does Kate. She's done a fantastic job at the company. Hmm, yeah. Hey, I gotta go, it's getting late. You know, it's a good thing we did some shopping... - Yeah! - Cleaned you up... It's all you, man! Thank-you, brother. Look at you, you're ready to rejoin society. I can't wait. She's waiting for you. Yeah. Welcome back. Thank-you. You err... Kiss her good night for me. Sure, I'll do that. Is David gone? Yes. I hope you enjoyed yourself, you didn't say much all through. There wasn't much to say but the food was good. You've been working out. I had to do something to keep me sane. I need to take a shower. - Good morning. - Good morning. I'm sorry. At least I can have a cup of coffee without it shrinking from me. Debo... This is not the kind of welcome I envisaged. I'm just trying to adjust. I have to get to work. I was thinking of coming in today. To work? I don't think that's a good idea. I mean, you just got back. So? I think you should rest today. I made you some toast and there's the leftovers from yesterday's party. I have to go, I'm running late. Oh and we are going over to Steve's for dinner tonight. Yeah! Sure. - Hey. - Hey. Morning. They didn't have chocolate, so it's your next best favorite thing. I've had breakfast. When your husband's home, you have breakfast at home. How are you doing? I'm okay. How's he doing? It's Debo. So...? I don't know... Everything is... awkward. Kate, that's to be expected, I mean, he was in prison for six years. Yeah, but... Never mind. Sorry I disturbed you. Hey, hey. Things are awkward right now... In time... normalcy will return. I guess I just didn't think things will be this difficult. - Everything will be okay. - Yeah. I have to get to work. Me too. I guess some things never change. What are you doing here this early? I'm not early, Vanessa, you are the one who's late. You know what I mean! Papi just came home yesterday. You should just be getting out of bed now. Pap… Well Papi understands that I need to work. And so do you. You need to sort through these files. I mixed them up rushing out of the house - this morning. - Hey... The earlier you start the better, Vanessa. What are they? Client files, deals, proposals, contracts... Are you ever going to transition into a paperless person? No. Why did I ask? I don't know. Hi! - Hi. - Why aren't you dressed? Debo, we leave for dinner in a few minutes. Well, I didn't know when or if you'd be back tonight. I had a lot of work to round up at the office. We need to get you a phone, if you had one, I would've called. And I need to renew my driver's license as well. Okay, but in the meantime, we both need to get ready, we're running late. Do we need to go for this thing? I don't feel like going. Call and cancel. Now? I can't call and cancel now. Why didn't you tell me you didn't want to go this morning? You didn't exactly ask me in the morning. You just told me and ran off, as if staying in the same room with your husband was suffocating! - Kate... - I'll call and tell them we can't make it. No, no, no! I, erm… I'll take a quick shower, change and then we can go. Kate, dear! - I'm so sorry we are late. - No, no. It's fine, it's fine. Mr. Devi. Ni.. Nice to finally meet you. Please come in! Stevo. The business is good, I think we should invest. And I think it's worth our time. You know I like numbers, give me figures, man! Hope you like it? - Yes, yes... - Of course, he does. I'm sure he didn't taste anything this good while he was in prison. Steve! I didn't realize we're not talking about it. It's okay. I did go to prison... but it's good to be back among friends... and family. So, what was it like? Anjie now! What? He said it's okay to talk about it. Did he say it was okay to talk about it now? Whether he wants to talk about it or not, people will still talk about it. I will! Steve... I need to know what plans he has for you now that he's out of prison. - What's funny? - Can we not talk about this now? - Why not? - It doesn't exactly make for conversation at dinner. Alright, fine. If you don't want to talk about the fact that your husband is a murderer, and an ex-convict... and the need to be worried about your safety, considering what he did to you the last time, no problem. Baby, please pass me the spaghetti. Thank-you. You freaking told him. You freaking told him! Why would you tell him that? Why? It's our business! Our marriage! Our business! Family dinner indeed! Making a mockery of me in front of everyone! I didn't know Dekunle and his girlfriend were going to be there. It's your fault! Why would you tell him what happened? Why? What happened was a bloody mistake and I apologized to you for it! What? You want to say something? No. Worried about your safety. That's the last time we are ever going to that house. Ever! Debo, He's the only family I have... I don't care! Simply because I went to jail, he thinks he can look down on me? Debo, please calm down! Oh trust me, I'm calm... I am. If I wasn't, your brother would be in a hospital with a bloodied nose! Debo! What? I went to jail for killing my father, so, giving the "only family" you have a bloodied nose... is a piece of cake. Ugh! What are you doing? I forgot you were home. Sorry. I should be the one apologizing. Apparently, I'm the one intruding in my own house. No. Debo, I didn't mean it that way. I'm sure you didn't. I suppose you're still trying to get used to me being around. Is that why you are not in bed? No, errm.. I was just reviewing some pitches submitted for Nolan Pharmaceuticals. Oh! Is Eddie still in charge? Yes. He's such a pain. I should go see him. He always hated that I could tell what he was thinking before he even said anything. I should take a look at those pitches and... - Uhm... - decide which way to go. We uhm… We are just bouncing ideas around. Maybe when we've fine-tuned things, you can have a look. Okay. I'm going to bed. Are you coming soon? I'll be there soon. Good. I don't know where this file can be. It was here. Oh god, I wonder where I kept it. Good morning. Rosie doesn't work here anymore? Not at all, she's on maternity leave. You're kidding me! When did she get married? Last year. - But who... - Faith, can you... Anthony Collins! Wow! - I can't believe it! When did you... - Yesterday! Wow! ED didn't say anything. I was trying to keep things quiet. How are the numbers? - They are jumping! - Ohhhh! I always love the sound of that! So... Errr... Is Kate in the office? I... I think she stepped out. Yes, she did. - Vanessa? - Er, she's not around. She called in sick. Okay, errmm... Wait, are you are back now? Soon, Tony, soon. Trying to get used to things. I'll see you around. Alright, sir. Take care, brother. No, I'm glad we could be of service to you. Oh, okay. I'll have Vanessa scan a copy tomorrow morning. Yes... Yes. I'm not sure. Is that what they said? Oh! No way... Really? I can't remember that though. I don't know, stop, you're embarrassing me... Hi! Please, can I call you back? Okay. Alright, bye. Who was that? Dekunle, Steve's friend. You met him the other night. Oh! I didn't know he was also your friend. Tsuh! Not really, I just helped him out with some business. What are you doing? Cooking! Since I was bored, I decided to make us dinner. Hmmm... What's that? Ah! I bought it for you actually. This is nice. Where did you get it? Oh no, I bought it online, had it delivered to the office. Thank-you. So, how was work? Very busy. I… I barely had a moment to breath. So you were in the office all day? Uh huh. Hmmm. I'll just errrrm... take this back to the kitchen and… check what's cooking. I think we need to go on a vacation. On vacation? Why? You just got back. Yes. From prison, not Paris. Which is exactly why I think we need to go on a vacation. See... time away from everything and everyone would do us some good. - Errr... - Come on! It's been too long. When was the last time we did anything together? I don't know. I don't know the last time I went on a vacation. You... never went on a trip while I was away? Even for a few days? When your husband is in jail, it's a bit... inappropriate to go gallivanting around the world, don't you think? Hmm... Hmm… Yeah, yeah… I would think so, yeah... But... I'm back now so...? - I don't... I have so much work... - Shhhh... Just say yes! I don't think I can. I have a lot on my table and I'm... I'll have to check my schedule. Fine. Fine, whatever. Just let me know. Yeah... What? He's upstairs sleeping. Of course not, I'm in the living room working. Or at least I'm trying to... Oh stop it, don't be silly now, of course, I miss you. Umm. Okay, I'll try to find time to come see you. Okay? Oh. I love you too honey... - No, Debo... - Who was that? - Who was that! - Debo! - Who was that? - I can't breathe! You're blocking… I can't breathe. Keisha... Vanessa's cousin... Check my phone, check my phone, Debo. Oh my God! Did you go through the contract? What contract? Didn't you get my email? What mail? Owwww. Okay. I went through it. I think you should err... tread carefully. I mean, it's a juicy deal but... 100 million Naira, as a monthly retainer... comes with responsibilities and liabilities. Try 400 million. Now, that's a juicy deal. 400 million? Yes. Oh that would change both our lives! You know, Kate, it's a... it's a pretty hot day. Why are you wearing a scarf? I kind of like... - I like the way it looks with the... - Remove it! - I'd rather not... - Kate, remove it. Debo did this to you? He didn't mean to... I was on the phone and he thought - I was having a conversation... - Stop! Stop it! Stop making up excuses for him! You used to do this before he went to prison, now he's back and you are doing the same thing! He's my husband... Kate, this has got to stop! Debo is my friend, but this has got to stop! I'm not going to sit by and watch this happen. - I'm going to have a word with him. - No! If you talk to him, it will only make things worse. Everything will be fine... I promise. Please, David, don't talk to him. Please? Well, somebody's getting it so much, she's only just coming into work. I can see you are feeling better. Papi can't get enough of you, can he? You have an overactive imagination, and please stop calling him Papi. - It's sexy! - It's crass! And my sex life is none of your business! It will stop being my business when you hook me up with a handsome bloke like - barrister David and I'm getting some! - Maybe you'll stop making it your business when I fire you! It's not funny. You should see your face. Wait, hold on, something came in for you. I'M SORRY ABOUT YESTERDAY. FORGIVE ME? What did Papi do last night? - You read it? - Of course I did! What if it was a bomb? - Then it would have blown up in your face. - Which shows how much I love you, I'm willing to die for you. Hmmm. Papi has good taste. I'm done with you. Hmmm. Did you get my package? Yes, I did. So... Am I forgiven? It's fine... We're fine. Good to know. So I'll see you at home? I... I have something special planned. Debo Devi... Ohhh! Whassup! Hmmn! Look at you! Gosh! What's it been? Like eight years? Seven! Seven, actually. But it feels like ten. I know right? I was hoping and praying that you hadn't packed up - and returned to... - Ah, not on your life! I mean, Nigeria is hard... but it can't get rid of me that easily... I know. So! What's all of this about? I was surprised when I got your call. What? I can't have lunch with an old friend? Bella, don't be like this. This is me! Talk to me. What's going on? I need your help. Okay. With what? I think my wife is cheating on me. So, why are you telling me? Because I need your help. I want you to follow her. So, that's it? You want me to spy on your wife? That's why you called me? You are a private investigator, Bella, and a damn good one at that. This is what you do for a living, isn't it? Why are you looking at me like that? Because... because I thought you called me here for something else. Like what? Never mind. Why do you think she's cheating? I overheard her... telephone conversation. Although, she tried to explain it away but... I can't shake the feeling that she's lying. And I tried to call the number back, and suddenly, it was unreachable. Maybe the phone was off. Uhhh! Nah. Besides, there are other signs... The lying, the shifty eyes, the unexplained trips, everything! Okay! So, clearly you know she's cheating. Why do you need me to follow her? What's the point? I need to know who he is. Debo... You're wondering what I'll do to him when I know who he is? Kill him like I killed my dad? At least, I didn't fire the shot that killed your mom. - Bella... I'm so... - Look. Debo... Tell me you weren't curious to know what my wife looked like when you heard I was getting married shortly after our breakup. Tell me you didn't do some digging, - tell me you... - Okay! Fine! But it's going to cost you, Debo. Oh, and trust me, it's not going to be cheap. I don't expect it to be. Debo, good afternoon! - Nice to see you. - Same here, Vanessa. How are you? The last time I was here, I was told you were sick. I'm very fine now, thank-you. I can see that, you're definitely looking very fine today. Thank-you. Where's my wife? Did she like my gift? The necklace? Gorgeous! And the chocolate? Hmm, to die for! Yes!! Is she in? She's gone out to a meeting. Oh really? With who? IGo. They're obviously new. One of the accounts we are trying to get. Hmmm... Do you think you can bring me up to speed with all our major accounts, so I can keep myself up to date before I resume next week? - Kate didn't tell me... - She probably forgot, - she's juggling a lot of things right now. - Yeah! Anyway, let's get started. So... I heard you were at the office today. - Uhm uhm... - I went for a meeting. So I was told. Vanessa told me you would be resuming work next week. Well... Are you? I could be... Don't you think I've rested enough? Or is there a reason you're trying to keep me away from a business I started from scratch? We started from scratch. Besides, it was just a question. I hear Cramstone is calling for a pitch. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't think there was a point seeing as I'm on top of things. Are you? Two years ago, you said exactly the same thing... You assured me you were going to seal the deal. - And I tried. - But failed! - Because KMD bribed their way through. - Which you should have done! This is advertising, baby! You settle some to make more! I'll go to Abuja and settle things. KMD had their chance and lost it. I don't intend for us to lose this again. - What do you mean nothing yet? - These things take time, Debo! Coupled with the fact that I had some... minor setbacks. What minor setbacks? Well... Your security guard ambushed my stake out, for one... And some unfortunate mishaps but, don't worry, I'm on it. But... You're a professional Bella, find a way around it. I am working on it! Listen, I will have something for you soon... That's if there's really anything going on. Did you just say if there's really anything going on? You think it's all in my head? I did not say that, Debo. But you've been gone for a while, maybe you're just misreading the signs. I went to prison, Bella, not Mars. And I still can tell when a woman is cheating so don't get coy with me. Just do your job! Can you do that? Yes, I can. Good! I expect some tangible feedback soon! You've been going at it since you got back, don't you think you need a break? I just need to round up on this proposal. Is something burning? Oh my goodness! I'm sorry about ruining dinner. I got carried away. Maybe you need a maid. A maid? I don't need a maid. I beg to differ. I burnt just one meal. Would you want to burn the entire house down first before you realize that you need some help around here? I am not saying you're doing a bad job as a home maker, I'm only saying that you need some help around here so you can concentrate on more important things like me. Besides, I would like this to be the last time I eat anything that tastes like dirt. I had a lot of that in prison, I do not want to relive the experience. Alright. We can get a maid. Good! Now… Can I get something else to eat? I'm done pretending I can eat... this. I BELIEVE I JUST SOLVED UR LITTLE PROBLEM MEET ME SAME PLACE… TOMORROW Are you out of your mind? You want me to move into your house as a maid? It's easier to spy on her when you're living in the house with us. I can't do it! You can't or you won't? Either, both, whatever! It doesn't matter, Debo. I can't move into your house with you. Not with the history we have! - History, Bella, that's what it is. - Huh? Don't give me that look, we both... scratch that, you decided that it couldn't work. I was right! I only agreed because I couldn't cheat on my wife at the time but now she's cheating on me! You have to do this for me, please. Debo! You already know that professionally speaking, I shouldn't have even agreed to do this job. - Why not? - You know why not! You already have me spying on your wife. Please, Debo, I am begging you... Don't let me move in with you. Firstly, you are not moving in with me, so stop being so melodramatic, and secondly, it's the only way this can work, at least the only way I can see. Bella, once you find who it is, you can leave. Besides, I'm leaving for a business trip in a few days. When d'you leave? The day after tomorrow. Bella, please, please. Fine. Are you sure you have everything you need? Uh hum. Good afternoon sir. My name is Ama, I was sent here from the Domestic Help Agency. Come in. Thank-you. Good afternoon ma. Hello. What's going on? She's from the Domestic Help Agency. Sorry. Why would you go ahead and call a domestic help agency without consulting with me first? You kept saying you were going to get around to it, but you didn't. And I didn't want to leave you in the house without any help so I took the bull by the horn. We need to leave now! I'm not gonna… I'm not going to leave... what's her name? Her name is Ama. - I can't leave her in the house. - Why not? She's a total stranger, Debo, I can't leave her in my house. Sweetheart, I have a guarantee from the agency. Alright, nothing is going to happen. Trust me. Okay? If we don't leave now, I'm going to miss my flight. Okay! You just sit till she gets back. Is that clear? Yes, sir. Good. Coming! Ugh! I'm coming! Sorry... Ma... Who are you? Err... Cat got your tongue? Who are you? What are you doing in my son's house? - I'm the... - Where is he? - Debo! - He's not here, ma! I think he went to the airport with his wife. - To do what? Where is he going? - I don't know, ma. What do you know? Ma, I'm new here, I just resumed. Then you better get back to work and earn your pay. - Hello ma... - Where's she? Did you not see my missed calls? I was driving. How was your... was it a vacation? You must have really had fun for you to have not been here when Debo arrived. Don't you have work to do? Sorry, ma. - Where is Debowale? - He went to Abuja. For what? To attend to some business for the company. Errr... Hmm... He's back to work now? - Kind of. - What do you mean kind of? Is he back to the office or not? He's not... not yet. He wanted to attend to this himself. - Why? - I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? What do you know? You are his wife! He wanted to go, I decided to let him go and not be intrusive. Tell my son I'm back in town and when he returns... I'd like to see him. Is she gone ma? - Yes! - Okay. I was quite surprised when I saw her when I opened the door. No offense ma, but she's quite... Troublesome? Yes, ma. Yeah, I didn't realize it until I married her son. A picture in a newspaper never really tells you what a person is like, does it? No. No, it doesn't ma. You're obviously very learned. And from your accent, not Nigerian. Having lived in this country for six years, I thought I'd lost my accent, and become more Nigerianite. No! You're going to have to try a little harder. - So, where are you from? - I'm from Ghana, ma. Oh. So, what's a learned Ghanaian woman doing as a house maid? - I need the money. - And you couldn't find a corporate job? It's not for lack of trying ma. The ratio of people looking for jobs like that is 50 to 1. You know the labor market right now, it's very stiff. I'd rather be doing something, anything, instead of just loafing around. Yeah... Anyway, ma. I'm about to get dinner started. Is there anything specific you want me to do for you? - No. I'm… - You're sure? Yeah. Anything you make is fine. Okay, ma. - Ma, should I help you? - No. I'm okay. I think I've shown you where everything is. - Yes ma. - If you need anything else, just call me. Okay, ma. Alright. OK. - Ma, have a good day. - Thank-you, you too. And this is why I've been telling you to hook me up with David. If I were with that hunk now, Mark won't have the nerve to speak to me anyhow. Honestly, Mark has become a pain in my behind. If I didn't know that by this time next week you'll be singing a completely different tune, I would actually take you seriously. You see what I'm saying? Mark has turned me to that kind of woman! Needy, indecisive, confused... And borderline incompetent. Look, Vanessa, when it's lunchtime, I can sit and listen to the chronicles of Mark. In the meantime, please can we get some work done? Yes, madam. Great! So Christine sent over some pitches for review for Midnight. I need you to have them printed. Also, I need you to get in contact with Austin. - Tedcare? - Exactly. Vanessa, sit on his neck till he gives you a date to review the contract. And when he does, relay the information to David. My David? Barrister David. Also, I need you to run a check on Ama Mensah. She's currently with the Domestic Help Agency. Facebook or any other social platform should do. I want to know what schools she went to, the kind of person she is, just basic information. Why? Who is she? Your replacement, if you don't get to work right now. I'm going to find a new best friend who isn't my boss. Please, do! You know what? You know what? - Love you, boo! - Whatever! Hello, Mr. Debo! Why is it taking you forever to pick your phone? Don't you greet? Anyway, having met your mum a few days ago, I'm not surprised. The apple clearly does not fall far from the tree. My mum came to the house? That's what I said! How is it going? It's going as good as it can be right now. What does that mean? Okay, I'm leaving the office. I'll see you soon. Okay, I'll stop and get some things on my way. I have to go now. I'll see you soon. Alright. Bye. And... who was that? None of your business. On a more serious note Kate, you've been grouchy lately. What's going on? Nothing, Vanessa, I'm just tired. Are you leaving? Yes, and I'm not coming back today so cancel my four o'clock meeting. Okay! This is the information on the girl you asked for. All of these? There's quite a number of Ama Mensahs on social media. Okay, put it in my drawer, I'll attend to it later. Okay. - See you tomorrow. - Okay. Yes, your highness! Oh oh! I have to call you back. I'll call you back. Thank-you. - Hello. - Hi. Hello ma. Hey, hello, Ama. Sorry, I haven't called you all day, I've been very busy. How is it going? - Fine, ma. - I hope you are not bored. Not at all ma. It's a big house, there's a… there's a lot to do. I can imagine. So, what are you doing right now? Err... I'm…I'm... I'm cleaning the bathroom ma. And scrubbing the toilets. Ah! Okay, the bathrooms definitely needed cleaning. Um. When you are done with that, if you are not too tired, please, could you arrange the wardrobe? - Alright ma. - That's if you are not too tired though, I know that cleaning and scrubbing can be tiring. No problem ma. Okay, I'll see you later okay? Okay, ma. Goodbye! Argggh! - Scrubbing and cleaning toilets. - Really, Bella? - Madam, good evening. - Good evening. - How was your day, ma? - It was fine, thank-you. Yours? Not bad. Is there anything in the car you want me to take? No, no, I don't have anything. What about dinner? I'm sure you're hungry, I've made food. Erm…no, not right now, maybe later. I need to shower first. - Okay. - Okay. Hello... You said you were going to call back, but you didn't. I haven't had time to call because I've been busy cleaning and scrubbing your house. I have to go. Don't you dare get off the phone! - Please, I have to call you back. - No! My boss is here... Alright, fine! Ergggh! You didn't have to get off the phone because of me. Don't worry ma. I'll call him back. Boyfriend? Debo! I was in the bathroom. Hey love! You're back. Obviously. You don't look too happy to see me. Don't be silly. Why didn't you call me to pick you from the airport? I wanted to surprise you so I took a taxi. Mission accomplished, I'm surprised. How did it go? Very well. I'll give you all the details once I'm settled in. Okay. I'm just about to leave for work, but I need to get my bag. Okay. Oga, welcome. You're back earlier than expected. Yeah! Things went faster than I thought. Well, that's a good thing. So any news for me yet? I'm working on it. - Bella you've been saying this... - But I have... You need to be patient, Debo. Oga, everything has been okay. Let me take your bag. Yeah. I need to leave for work now, but I'll see you when I get back. If you need anything, just ask Ama. Let me get my laptop. Duty calls! Are you serious? I can't believe that you signed a 400 million naira deal at your first attempt back in the game. Well, they haven't signed the contract, but, they're down with it. How did you pull it off? Kate has been working that account forever with no success. Let's just say... I have my ways. Okay, I'm sorry but as your friend, no, more importantly as your lawyer... you need to shed some more light on the subject. I reminded the chairman of some things he wishes I didn't know about him, and explained how he can exchange the deal for my silence. Debo, this is not exactly the time to be going around blackmailing anybody, - especially seeing as... - I understand my mum greased some palms - to get me out but... - It's more than that. Maybe you should ask her. I hear you are busy, going to Abuja, doing business. About that… I had a chat with David. And that's supposed to concern me somehow? Yes! Oh! So what feat have I achieved to become the subject of male gossip? How did you get me out of prison? Well... I'd love to take credit for that, but you know, you served some time and got a presidential pardon, end of story. That's the story for the press. I want the truth. What did you do to get a presidential pardon? Oh, come on Debo, you know what I did! - I bribed a lot of people. - Mum you've been bribing people since the trial and I still went to jail. Well this is not the time for such a conversation. Just answer me, dammit! What do you care? You are a free man! It's Senator Danladi, is it not? Are you serious? Are you serious mum, you went back to him! Keep down your voice! After your relationship with him almost ruined our lives! - He has the President's ears! - So what? That man is the reason you and dad had a fight, and my intervention ended up in murder! Your father was a bastard! I don't care! What was I supposed to do? What was I supposed to do? I wanted you out of there! Everything I did, I did... I did it all for you. You did it for you! Don't you dare put this on me! You were with him, right? The day of my release? That's why you couldn't come for my welcome party? This is messed up. You... are messed up mum! What are you doing here? What do you mean, what am I doing here? I work here! My point exactly! You should be out there figuring out who my wife is cheating with. No! I should be right here finishing all my chores before my "boss" gets in so I don't blow my cover! Well, it seems to me that you have been caught up in your make-believe job that you have forgotten your real job! The fact that you're actually thinking that is insulting to me! If you had results for me, I wouldn't think that! You want results? No problem. Here... Look at it. Isn't this Dekunle? You know him. He's her brother's friend. So you're the one eh? As you can see, Debo, there are two guys in this picture. David is a friend of the family, he's my best friend! Fair enough! But you still need to give me enough time to find more incriminating evidence. This is enough. No, it's not! You are done! I'll take it from here. Where does he stay? Come on! You obviously checked him out, you know his name. Where does he stay? Can you relax! Just calm down! Dammit, Bella! Where does he stay! Ah! Just the person I want to see! That's a first! What's going on? - I need... - Another first! Debo Devi needing... something from me? Just, shut up! Or what, Debo? You don't scare me. OK. I'm not one of your pretty... Stop it! What's wrong with you? What happened between you and Steve? Debo, did you really have to do that to his face? Look, I know you don't like him... and yes, he can be a bit tactless sometimes but I expected you to show some self-restraint! Oh, shut up! What stupid self-restraint? The same you show when you sleep with his friend? What! Don't you dare play dumb with me! You lying, cheating whore! Debo! You heard me! That's why you wouldn't give it up uh? You starve your husband of sex but you give it freely to your brother's friend. It was all Steve's idea, right? Hmm? Debo! No, no, no, Debo! Debo! Deb... Debo! Oh Debo. No Debo. Debo, Debo, Debo... - You're my wife! - Get off me! Debo! Debo, no, no, no! Debo! Oh my God! Damn! What's wrong with you? Kuh! Feeling better? You're wondering what that was about right? It's none of my business. Apparently that's what happens when a man hasn't had some in over six years. You're not sleeping with him? Is it because there's somebody... else, ma? It's more complicated than that. Honestly, I never thought he was coming back. Why? He was convicted for murder, he killed his own father. His father was a son of a bitch! S... Sorry, ma. But that's what I heard! I agree. His father was a real bastard. Everyone knew about the greed, the corruption, the rumored killings, the other women, and how he abused and mistreated his mother... But killing his father? He did that. He consciously did that and that changes everything. The irony of life is that sometimes we become the exact people we hate. I'm sorry. You only came to work for us and here I am burdening you with all our problems. It's okay, ma. I don't mind. I have to go. Back to the house? No. I need to go and see David. They're friends. He can talk some sense into him. Okay, ma. - Thank-you. - You're welcome, ma. Where's my wife? She went to see David. Apparently he's the only one that can talk some sense into you after you went crazy like today! What was that? - Bella, I'm sorry. I... - Tch! Save it! I'm going to get my things. Wait... Wait... Please... Look, I don't know what came over me. Alright, I was just mad! She's having an affair with someone else and she is not sleeping with me! I'm her husband for goodness sakes! Calm down! Look, I understand your frustration... Do you? Do you? Have you ever wanted something so badly, it's within your reach and yet... you can't have it? Yeah. Yes, I have. Bella... Debo... Let me just... No! No, I will not be your rebound, I won't! Bella... What! Hmm? I think there's someone at the door. Yeah. What the hell is wrong with you? She is your wife for goodness sake! Exactly! She is my wife; I'll handle my business! Handle it how? By killing her eventually as well? You don't understand! You're damn right I don't understand! I don't understand how you can be so savage? I don't understand how you... after being in there... She's cheating on me! Okay! Who told you that? I hired a PI. You did what? - When? Why... - It doesn't matter! Alright she's cheating on me, with her brother's friend, Dekunle. Yeah. I thought they were just friends, I didn't think anything of it when I saw them together. Well, they are screwing each other. Ah ah! Yeah! Yeah! I had that same reaction. Sssss! Yeah. D... Where is my wife? Debo... Where the hell is my wife? Or do you want your own share of the action? I can see that you're either drunk, or mad! Whichever one it is, I'm not letting Kate anywhere near you tonight! She'll be back in the morning D! You are staying with me tonight. You're not leaving me now, are you? Stop it! It's clear that you want your wife, Debo, just go and get her. Please... You overheard my conversation with David? You mean your shout-out with David? Yeah. I heard it all. Bella... I don't love her anymore, she's unfaithful... It didn't seem that way moments ago... You know what's funny, Debo? You are accusing her of the exact same thing that you were doing with me! Bella, you're upset! Upset! Of course I'm not upset. Why should I be upset? She's your wife. Debo... please... Shhh... Debo, stop! Please. Debo, we shouldn't... Please don't do this, please. Debo, we shouldn't! We already did, huh? We already did. Hey, I can't talk about this right now. Y... yeah. Errr... Can we talk about this... tomorrow? I... am in the middle of something yes… thank-you. Certainly. Work? Yeah. He's sleeping with her, you know? Debo is sleeping with her. The maid… PI... Ama... whatever her name is... How do you know? I saw her changing through the window when you went in. What's wrong? How come you didn't tell me that, the reason why you and Debo fought, was because he... he found out you were cheating with Dekunle? I didn't tell you because it's not true! Look, Dekunle and I are friends and he's a client. Kate, I have cared for you... all these years, I have been there... Never once have you returned, the affections. That's not true! I have felt the way you felt, exactly the way you felt... But why won't you let me touch you? - Why? - Because I am still married! Okay, yes he is... aggressive, and possessive, and a control freak and has hurt me in ways unimaginable but... David, he is still my husband. But not anymore... Not anymore... I'm going to ask him for a divorce, and I can be free to be with the man that loves me. Oh, Kate. "Gone out. See you later." Shit! Hi! Good morning, ma. Call me Kate... and thank-you for yesterday. You're welcome. How was your night? I hope you were able to sleep without any nightmares. No, ma. Where is he? - He's gone out. - Oh. Is there anything else I can get you? No. I just came in to get my things. You're not staying? Nope... I'm done pretending. I'm done being the subject of his rage. I'm done thinking he's going to change. And I cannot risk losing another pregnancy to his fits of rage. That's why I refused to sleep with him. I'm not sure I can bear the thought of losing another child. Thank-you for yesterday. It was really nice knowing you... Ama. Duty here is over. Ta... Take care. Good morning sunshine! Somebody's happy today. Uh-uhm. I feel free and light. I did not realize you were caged and heavy. Papi's in a meeting with Swipe-It. You didn't tell me he was resuming earlier than planned? Don't worry, I will also ask the creative team to micromanage their ideas. - Morning Kate. - Hi good morning. Okay, we'll be expecting to hear from you soon. Sure. I need you to book a flight going to Abuja for me this afternoon. I need to attend a meeting. - Okay. - Thank-you. What are you doing? Taking back my company. You mean our company?... Not anymore! BELLA You're joking, right? He's throwing me out, David. Taking everything that I have worked for, for the past six years away from me, because I asked him for a divorce. What do you want to do? This is Debo Devi we are talking about. And I am Kate Devi! I ran that company for six years! Turned it into one of the best advertising agencies, in this country! David, I stood my ground and fought my way up, even when people wouldn't give me a chance. Why? Because my husband murdered his father. I am going to fight him. Whatever it takes! I have had enough of his bullying! It's him! Debo! You're home early. What's wrong? Long day. What's this? The terms to your divorce; or not. How do you mean? Kate, if you divorce him, you lose everything. How is that possible? It's a clause... It's a clause in the memorandum. I didn't think things would get this far. I…I did it to protect his interests at the time. What about my interests? The bastard! I can not let him win this, he has taken too much away from me already! What do you want to do? I want everything that rightfully belongs to me! Well there's no way that's going to happen legally. I made sure of that in the contract. So, what do I do? You have access... to the accounts. He's a co-signatory. So then we forge his signature... How? You leave that to me. Okay. Let's say we forge his signature, I can't move that kind of money out of the bank without raising eyebrows. Not if the account officer is in the know. And we get him to sign something that incriminates him, just in case he changes his mind. Okay, let's say he agrees to do that, I can't move that kind of money into my account. People will get suspicious... So we move it across different accounts so the money can't be traced. You do know that if... and when he finds out about us, we're dead? Yeah, I know... which is why I'm making... arrangements for us to leave the country. For good! You don't say! I know the man; he's my friend. Oh? What? Are you changing your mind? About taking the money? No! About going away with me? What's the alternative? You tell me? I love you. And I love you. It's Debo. Hey, Debo! Have you gone through the contract I sent you? Yeah, you're all good. You're good to go. Great! And Kate? Has she agreed to my terms? She's thinking about it. Make her agree, David, she listens to you. Yeah, I'll do my best. Otherwise, I will ruin her. Debo! I take it you got my messages... Seriously Bella? Seriously. I'm a small boy running with my tail in between my legs, who can't stand up to responsibility? Really? I see that it got your attention. I've been busy! That's a line a man gives a woman when he's trying to avoid her! Look, I... I don't need you to explain... I didn't call you to... I'm the one calling you, Bella! Hmph. Now I am calling you. I want my money, Debo! I can't do that. I left you a note saying I was going to Abuja. Wire me my money now Debo! I can't do that, I haven't sorted all of that out. When do you come back? Right now, I don't know. I could get a friend to arrange it if you need it urgently. I do! Alright, I'll talk to David. Great! I'll wait for feedback and hopefully, Debo, I wouldn't have to send you another stinker, just to get your attention. Bella... Oh man! Yeah, okay... so how long is it going take to be ready? Err…No. - WITH LOVE FROM K&amp;D - I'll see you soon. No... I'll have company with me. Bye. Sorry to keep you waiting. No problem, sir. I'm supposed to give you a cheque. You know I didn't realize that maids earned so much. Mr. Devi and his wife are, very generous, sir. Uhm uh. All there? Yes, it looks okay. That'll be all then? Yes. It was nice meeting you, sir. Come on Debo! Who are you on the phone with? Come on! Yes, we are in business! Whoo! I agree. We should have celebratory drinks as soon as you get in. Actually, I just landed. I'll be in your office in a short while. Great! See you soon. Yes! Hmmph, that's whassup! Whow. Uhm, uhm, uhm. Yes. That's good. Make sure the package is delivered exactly as I instructed. Thank heavens! Where have you been? I just landed. What's up? It's David! Huh? The guy Kate has been cheating with. It's not Dekunle, It's David. Which David? How many Davids do you know? Your best friend, David! Hello? Hello? Damn! Turn the car around. Turn the car around. Turn the car around! Here, here, here, stop, stop. Wait for me. Shit! Shit! Go, go, go, go, go, go. Faith, darling. We... Has Kate been here today? No. Does she contact you? - No, Debo. - Damn! This bag came for you, sir. Shit, shit, shit, shit. Damn! By the time you read this, I will be long gone. Long gone with all the money that belongs to me. Now I know this might come to you as a shock, but I found out! I found out about your plans to swindle me out of what belongs to me. I know. Everything is going according to plan. Once we have her money, we'll be gone... far away from here. And getting married... love you I love you so much, Christine. Sure. I have to go. And I decided to take matters, into my own hands… and I took it all. You took it all. I cut a deal with the accounts officer; who I am sure is on his way to starting a new life… - It's not supposed... - Like me. Oh! Your flight is boarding, ma. Thank-you very much. Where's your husband? Mr... David. If he's not within the premises, he will miss his flight. - He won't be joining us. - Oh, okay. Are you married? Not yet, ma. Have a safe trip. Please stop by on your way back. I won't be coming back.
