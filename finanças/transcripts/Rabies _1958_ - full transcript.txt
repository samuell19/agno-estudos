Rabies Scenes from the human life Introduction by Bachelor of Medicine Bo Stensson Svenningson Subtitles by Nostromo If you in the Scenes from the human life want to express something you found essential in life Then you have both to try to refine your chosen point of view and also arrange that the scenes themselves express this To refine your chosen point of view is difficult It cannot be done at the expense of the truth And letting the scenes speak for themselves is even worse Because a misunderstanding could easily occur Often an author finds it suitable to have clarifying comments in his scenes He speaks for himself in a narrative and in a drama he introduces a commentator to comment on the action In these scenes from the human life which I intend to show I will aim,if possible, to avoid a commentator But I resign myself to the possibility that despite good intentions I have to introduce one In that case I would chose a female commentator A female commentator I want to do this,not to be chivalrous to the ladies and I'm not doing it in order to cloak myself in anonymity I want to have at the same time an authoritative and neutral person Therefore I will chose the old mother I know very well I have clinical experience of this That the old mother is often broken with arteriosclerosis and stroke That she is a foolish old woman perhaps using dirty words Or curses or blusters But she is principally an authentic person She is not anchored socially She is ageless and universal She understands and forgives everything And everybody feel guilty at least with a pretended respect to listen to her It is often testified that old mothers never really want to admit that their children have grown up The children may have reached any high position But for the old mother they are still the small child In the Scenes from the Human Life she is the only possible commentator But she is not going to appear in my drama Well Finally let's see how I can resolve this First scene from the human life It's night,silent and dark in village shop owner Garberg's house The son,young Sixten is in bed with the maid You -Sixten -Mmm Did you see the new furniture for the bedroom which he transported to the Svensson's today? Mmm We should also have such one It was red with a mosaic on the the gables Damn,mosaic on the gables? Yes,what do you think we should have instead? Ah? Do you prefer a white bedroom furniture? I just want to tell you that if you come to me and say you're pregnant,don't try that with me You can't say that Ah,don't try to fool me with a baby,damn you if you try Well,that's not my fault Why do you blame me? Sixten You crap No,let me go Damn you,stop choking me You're so bloody heavy Why should it be my fault? It's not I who is pregnant You've a better reason to do something about it than me And I can tell you how to do something If you get a baby then it's because you want it But don't try that with me You certainly understand what I mean But if I end up in that situation? Sixten Sixten!! Gee! Are you really pregnant? No,why not? I've always trusted you,Sixten You Why are you so mean and frightening? Huh BTW you know it can't be true A fortnight ago on Wednesday I told you we couldn't do it Dear Sixten How can it be that you thought such a crazy thing? Well,old dad said yesterday that you looked so big No,you must be joking,he never said that Yes,big and showing off your stomach as you do Heck, anybody could believe you were 9 months pregnant You didn't say anything to the oldster About what? About us,of course! He has known that for a long time No Yeah Have you told him that? I don't remember it But the old man understands that by himself BTW I've never hid it from him And the old man is not as stupid as you think Sixten,how could you do that! After this I can never look him in the eyes Please don't pretend! If the old man had been a puritan Then he'd thrown you out of the house a long time ago But,you know,he's no zealot I'll tell you the old man was a real womanizer in his youth You know a real Don Juan So I got it in my blood I can't help it,I can't let it go I'm chasing every skirt when I see one Shame on you But I still like you,dear Sixten Now,stop that! I don't want you glued to me So damned sweaty, you notice that by licking I'm not at all sweaty If you could feel it you wouldn't say so I'm not at all sweaty You only say so because you've cold feet BTW I wouldn't mention sweating in your place You really are cheeky! I know it's difficult but try to behave like a human being I must say I am as human as you are Oh,but there's a small difference between people and cattle(Swed.expr) And you dare raise your voice, when it suits you You should stop this conduct Sixten,how can say that to me? Haven't I been nice to you? Sixten We really are engaged And Sixten am I not your fiancée? We've been secretly engaged, you said so yourself Haven't you've done that,eh? Sixten,you've promised, Sixten aren't we engaged? Yes,of course,you can always call it to be engaged You always do that when you're courting We are engaged Have you been married,have you done what they call "begami" What have you done now? At least you can answer me Damned,you must really know that you always have to say something similar to the girls They like it that way Fancy that you're such a wretched coward You are the worst coward I've ever met Only because your old man says something You're so miserably afraid of him You are completely in his leash No one else can pull it You are a coward and evil and break your promises Shut up Only because I'm really honest about this, is not an excuse for you to be rude Don't you think I can see through you And you know,you thought we should immediately tie the knot But you shouldn't think that we want such a damned whore like you in our family Your family I know your type You and your old man are really gangsters and should be reported to the police,you really should be You just watch out Jenny,Jenny Come forward immediately,come forward You,you I'll tell you something I was just joking,Jenny Second scene from the human life Sometime later A sunny summer Sunday on the beach But this must be Eivor? Yes,hello Jenny,how nice to see you,it's been a long time -How are you nowadays? -Thanks I feel fine,you? Yes,I'm fine Can't you sit down here for a while or have you company? No,I only came down here alone to have a swim -Tonight I'm busy of course -Well -You've got a job in the town? -Yes I have an employment at Bank Manager Glewenborg's house,got my own room With radio and very nice You know,that house is really big,the city palace I've heard about them But you know that Mrs Glewenborg is mean It's no that bad,the bitch is of course almost never at home She is either on some seaside resort or in Stockholm But where do you work nowadays? I have quit,I'm engaged you know,really engaged with a ring Are you? In that case I must congratulate Was it a long time ago? No,it was last Tuesday, we're getting married next week Damn it! Oh,I just ripped off the shoulder strap on my bra Such a nice bra you've got Really? My fiancé is swimming down there If you stay here for a while you might see him No,I'll just get a dip,you know, I have to leave quickly I have a date tonight But that must be fun Is he old? No,26 years old he's village school teacher,and has found such a good position in Ledberga Are you going to live in the countryside? Well,I'd never be pulled by some pupils and move from the town Everybody is different Speaking for myself,ugh,I feel sick just thinking of the countryside It's very beautiful in Ledberga, we'll most likely enjoy it there We were there last week and looked at our new flat It is quite modern,you know, with large and sunny rooms No,thank you Have you been there during the winter? No,I haven't But it is It is such healthy air there, high up and beautiful Yes,that's nothing new for Erik You know,he became ill during his military service,and been frail for a few years Has you fiancé tuberculosis? But please,he's big and strong A real athlete But he suffers from insomnia Yes,the doctor said there was something wrong with the nervous system But he's much better now It's distressing with nervous diseases It usually recurs Yes,I've sometimes been a bit anxious about it You know,Erik suffers from melancholy He's so kind so he suffers from all evil in the world That's horrible for Eivor,if he should go completely mad No,please,there's no risk of mental illness The doctor said that BTW he's just fine now That seems OK As long as he can do his work Will you accompany me to have a swim? No,I've already had my dip But,if you go down now,I'll go with you and have a look at Erik I find it worrying that he's been away for so long time How can you allow him to swim alone? Well,I can't swim And I don't want to show him that I'm worried But if you go down now,I can accompany you and have a look at him Do you know that girl for a long time? Yes,we were schoolmates And then we've met a few times She's a very nice and well-behaved girl Indeed I thought she had a strange look in her eyes She really didn't look friendly I also think so BTW we don't need even to talk about her She was just here for a swim, and would then leave at once What are you looking for? Oh,it was nothing I thought that I'd put it in my bathrobe pocket The bathrobe pockets are so deep, so it's difficult to feel what's in them Where did I put it? Was it your gold bracelet? Just that Please wait,think carefully, when did you last see it? It was just before I had a dip I had it with me down to the shore,I remember that clearly But I forgot to put it in the bag And then when I entered the water, I put it in the bathrobe pocket When I came up again, I felt again if it was there It wasn't there I can't understand why I didn't put it on at once It must be here Where was the bathrobe? Here,it was here,it's been here all the time The bracelet could not have run away! I will shake it once more -Whose clothes are those? -They are Jenny's You both left at the same time? Yes Did yo go first? Yes Yes but Erik,you can't start suspecting I know Jenny,we were school mates Quiet,she comes here Oh,such a nice swim It's a pity to be in a hurry, I'd like to stay here the whole day You know Jenny,something very dreadful has happened I've lost my gold bracelet It was a thick mangled gold bracelet I got from Erik I am so sorry But have you really lost it? Are you sure you brought it with you? Perhaps you realize,Eivor, that you really didn't have it with you But I've told you it was here If it's not here then it must be in the sand But both of us don't believe you had it with you Wouldn't be better if you searched at home? Jenny,please,could you shake your clothes before dressing? More than welcome! I've nothing else than this Please have a look I can shake my bathrobes pockets also in case you think your bracelet is there Are you satisfied now? I'm sorry I didn't mean that I only meant that you had a look beneath your clothes You,I'll go and fetch a rake There was one down at the shore Yes a rake,at least that would be something It's stupid to rake with the hands in the sand like Eivor BTW you've forgot it at home No,it must be here It would be so sad if I lost it,I got it from Erik Is he also thinking it's sad? I mean your fiancé The school teacher looked angry I'm sure you'll see that he'll be sleepless because of this Well,that's the worst thing about it Aha I suppose I have to move so you can rake this place It seems that you only find cigarette butts Believe me Go home and instead start raking in Eivor's drawers as was your first thought I'm raking the whole path down to the shore Please,Miss,maybe you could move a bit? This place or that? But aren't you crazy? Do you think you're in an asylum? I have to do it systematically Please at least stop scratching my legs Here Here you have it again,Eivor Oh,how wonderful Well,tell me why you were standing on the bracelet? Would I? Would I stand on the bracelet? Yes,now you are a bit too rude Well,you did that I noticed all the time there was something funny with you Something funny with me? But please,hold me I heard from Eivor that the doctor said you were a bit crazy But at least,try to behave like a human being I can't be blamed that Eivor is the most careless in the world I know her perfectly well since her childhood Miss,your opinions about my fiancée don't interest me OK,but now you've at least heard it And do you want to know more about her? Then you can ask her what she did with Oscar in the lilac arbour Oh,that's a lie,nothing happened between Oscar and me Not indeed? Then your fiancé can speak with Oscar directly If he wants to hear the truth BTW I think you deserve to have found a madman Good bye Third scene from the human life Late autumn.A rainy evening. The home of Erik and Eivor in Ledberga Erik's Aunt is having a chat with Eivor Aunt,are you freezing? Shall we light the fire? No,not at all dear child If you don't have any firewood then you shouldn't go out and fetch it in this weather Oh,no,if we want a fire than we can wait until the boys come back and can bring it in You know,Eivor? I'm wondering if you are not too kind to Erik Just as Erik's mother was once upon a time But Erik himself is such a kind person Yes,of course he is He really is Oh no,you can't believe that I think differently I have always appreciated the kind Erik Yes,certainly you know that there were special ties between Erik and his Aunt When he was a child,Erik and his Aunt had so many discussions But he was very nervous Does Aunt find him worse since getting married? Dear child,not at all,he seems to be as happy as he can be And you're such a sweet little girl No,but I want in all kindness just to warn you no to spoil Erik My sister Selma spoiled him way too much Yes,I think I have to say this if I was to be sincere I'm absolutely sure that he would never had the nervous breakdown like he had,if she had brought him up differently Erik was so mawkish as a child But you shouldn't take notice of that But Erik says that he is alive today because of his mother You shouldn't bother at all about that Those who say that they'll commit suicide, they are the ones who never really do it Erik's melancholy,it's pure nonsense I've understood that all the time Well,you'll also understand it,dear Eivor I understand so little,Aunt knows that I never had the opportunity to read and study I just hadn't time to think it through either Pessimism is a sin Say that to Erik,he needs to hear that Yes,you might influence him Because nowadays he listen more to you than to his Aunt When he was ill,I gave him a book which was called "Happiness" I don't know if he ever read it as he never thanked me And I've not seen it on your book shelves No,but there exist so many good and noble,self-sacrificing persons Erik should look up to those and not dig himself into his melancholy It's just so morbid everything But Aunt,do you think I can influence Erik so he became more cheerful? Just tell him But what am I supposed to say? Tell him that you don't want to hear his stupidities Really speak out I'll tell Aunt,it's not that easy Dear child,you could still be good friends Aha,as many as I love, I rebuke and chasten as it says in the Scriptures And had sister Selma only given him a birching in due time Then he never would had been mentally ill Yes,that's as true as I'm sitting here No,such melancholy should never be exploited And you shall never let you be tyrannized by Erik's nerves Yes,yes,Erik is kind There's no question about that And the whole human life is so rich and bright and beautiful And I think you shall tell him that straight Yes,my dear Eivor,I'm saying this to you in all kindness Because I think you're such a clever and sweet little girl Yes,I quite understand Aunt's good intention But I have to tell Aunt that it's not that easy to follow Aunt's advice -Because sometimes Erik is right -Right? Erik is right? What do you mean by that? Sometimes he's really right about things Can you imagine what a strange thing happened this summer when we went to the beach in the town When Erik was in the water one of my school mates approached me,sat down and started talking And I've always thought she was such nice and sweet girl But Erik said instantly that she looked strange in her eyes And can Aunt imagine that she tried to steal that gold bracelet I've got from Erik Ah,just talk It was really like that I thought she was so awful and she said horrible mean things I suppose that it was grist to the mill for Erik Of course he became sad But you must become that Aunt cannot understand how awful everything was I even shivered right in the sunshine Perhaps you also became sleepless No I wasn't I became worried for Erik Dear Eivor You must take care that you are not infected by Erik You must be rectifying him and tell him to look on the bright side And when that's not possible,just close your eyes and turn the deaf ear to him Just do that and don't care about Erik's nonsense To convince Erik is not that easy,Aunt knows that Good grief! I don't want to dispute with him Oh,no,I suppose I'm too old and tired for it But good advice should not be sneered at How dreadfully long before the boys are returning Yes,and they also found themselves in awful weather Can you imagine that Erik always says that it's so nice to talk to Knut He also says that Knut is so gifted Yes,he really is and Erik may discuss with him as much as he wants Knut thinks it's a pleasure to hear him,I know that Yes,Knut,a thoroughly healthy person with no predisposition for melancholy For him I've no worries at all Ah,Good day again,my dear boys Did you get wet? No,it was nothing serious, we were dressed for the occasion Now Knut has to thank his cousin for the walk Yes,that was really nice of you,Erik to show so many beautiful views and roads Thank you,Erik Which direction did you go? We went a while in the Bidö forests Oh,there's not anything as beautiful and wonderful like the forest Such a wonderful peace,such a wonderful serenity in the big grave forest Yes,that if anything,I think speaks to the Grace of God Don't you think we should light the fire? Erik? Yes,if you want to Aunt is perhaps freezing No thanks,not on my behalf And in that case it won't be necessary When one who is old like me isn't freezing then you are probably not freezing either who are young and healthy Alas,the happy youth I am so happy for you And BTW I've no reason for complaint Oh,no Aunt has only joys here in life Yes,and the last and not the least of my joys is that I have a niece who is so kind and tender to his old Aunt So nice that he has got such a sweet and young wife My dear Eivor If it's nice weather tomorrow Aunt and myself will also have a walk We can go to Litet Må,it's a comfortable road there and no hills Don't you think that would suit Aunt,Erik? Certainly Has Knut been there? What the heck,there,we've been there, that would suit Mummy perfectly Not too many hills and knolls and just right to move the small body Ah,Mum is sitting still too much and getting too fat Knut is always joking with his dear mother Yes,Knut,I must tell you in case there's a misunderstanding Think,Knut is so delighted that his mother will go out in the forest Yes Oh,how beautiful it is here in Ledberga Yes This is such a place you long back to Think,I already feel it right now Alas,when such beauty and benevolence is exposed How good must not the true source be? The forest's sound like the organ and is for me like the most almighty sermon Yes,everything for me speaks of the gratitude for the big as well as the small things in the world Yes,how happy I am to have come here and have a look at your dear home and the woods around Everything is peace No,it's not peaceful Dear Erik That was a strange statement Aunt speaks as if the sound of the forest is like the sound of the organ Yes,one might suggest that if it's not that peaceful in the churches,but compare that to the forest Erik,it's wonderful in the forest Yes,yes,sure it's wonderful in the forest But if you think of everything which the forest says with its mighty idiom like a harrowing sermon and then ask yourself about the source maybe one has to say like this that the source is not only wonderful,it's miraculous Below the sound of the organ you hear a permanent crunch Perhaps you don't understand what type of crunch I mean It crunches between the teeth of the animals when they eat each other There are big jaws and small jaws And so tiny small jaws that you need a magnifier to see them And all those small beaks Which peck and hack without the slightest pause Every one eat each other,they are born to be found in each others bellies Under the romantic forest lake serene surface it's the same thing,yum,yum,yum The natural selection is just nonsense The nature has only concentrated itself that the eating shall continue The eating shall continue, the eating shall continue How would not then the actual source be,the eternal clear I don't think that Erik,who is a teacher, should blaspheme God I'm not blaspheming God, I'm just telling you how it is A pure objective information The life on earth is totally focused on the eating of other creatures It is like that,neither Aunt nor myself can do anything about it These are horrible fantasies That is just what I think Think about what a horrible fantasy is required to invent all this ugliness If God really once stood there with the nothingness Think Think,to stand there with peaceful nothingness the eternal peace and do all this Yes,that's incredible What can you say about such a source? It is crawling and creeping and flying and swimming and during the whole time big rapacious jaws are crunching Such an excess of horrid fantasy The human being has at least an eternal soul and Erik should think of the words of the psalmist "Grafven allt förliker,himlen allt förklarar"JO Wallin (The grave reconciles everything,the heaven explains everything) Really Yes,that won't be true Don't you think we anyhow should light the fire,what about you,Erik? By all means You dear sensitive girl Yes in Eivor,you've really got the ideal wife So kind and caring,and it's a pleasure for your Aunt to see you in such tender arms Stop crunching me,I don't want to be crunched between Aunt's teeth Think Think,I have heard that the Law of the Earth is to be eaten or eat But that's a misunderstanding The Law says eat and be eaten Yes,you eat until you're eaten From one human being you can draw out the other Just like you can draw one fish out from the other's belly in long series No,BTW That was not really true The human being is not devouring her neighbour whole She is more like Like a rabies infected dog She's got the poison in the blood and must bite the others She is of course without any guilt It is so,this is what she is doing Rabid dogs running around and bite each other And already as a puppy is she biting I must know that I know the children Are you saying that your old Aunt is a rabid dog? No,now I want to retire and go to bed Aunt,forgive me I didn't mean anything mean I am a rabid dog,we all are rabid dogs,but mostly myself I'm sorry if I have hurt you,Aunt, I didn't mean anything evil I was just saying how it is I think Knut,you can confirm that it isn't true I didn't mean anything,you know that,you know that,don't you? By George,yes,you see,Mummy did not understand what you said Dear Mummy,you see,this is this is philosophy,it's the truth, so you don't need to care about it You are both too educated for your old Mother and Aunt And now I think Knut and I should thank for today and say Good night Aunt is still angry with me,I hear that Why should I say such things, how could I be so stupid Aunt doesn't care at all that you were stupid Yes,it was very stupid of me I know more than enough that Aunt can't understand what I mean Oh,I might not be that simple-minded as you think At least your head for study was from my father And I can tell you that old Aunt was also very good at school And if I had,like you, the possibilities to study I might have reached much further than you,you see I received both praise and prices in school,you know So you don't need to be so condescending towards your Aunt But listen,dear Mummy,Erik didn't mean that Of course not,I fully believe, I know for sure that Aunt was intelligent but But Aunt has never understood how things really are here in the world Aunt has a stereotype of the world and the nature Though It was wrong of me to take the stereotype away from Aunt It is unfair of me to take away from any human being her illusions It is as though I thought the truth had a certain value I am like a man who has the knowledge about a murder I can't be silent,I I have to speak,I have to confess what I know There There is the Murderer Everybody look up at him Everyone believes he is an honourable man But I know the truth He is the greatest murder of passion in all times Almighty,eternal and blessed He is listening with pleasure to the crunching Dear Erik Yes,know I understand your insomnia and that you are frail You can't be anything else with such views Don't say anything more,dear Mummy, otherwise mother's price might be withdrawn Knut,he always wants to deflect everything with a joke And that's very kind of you But we must try to help the poor Erik Yes,the best is probably to joke about it Knut's happy disposition is a great asset A happy disposition is a gift from God It is something to be grateful of Think about that,Knut That's right,that's right Laugh at everything Laugh at the crunching,chew and chew and laugh when it's crunching That's the way to do by God's image No,now I think Mum wants to go to bed Yes,Knut,Good night,dear Eivor Aunt wants to thank you and give you a real hug Well,Aunt wants to hug her Erik also,well,sleep well Thank you both Thanks,thanks that you wanted to see Aunt and Knut in your beautiful home So long Fourth scene from the human life The room of subalterns in a rural garrison Knut Mosterson,conscripted sergeant,and Sven, conscripted corporal,are sitting reading Enter Sorry to interrupt But I've received a too small cap and I wonder What are you standing there and saying something -I've received a too small cap -Have you done your military service? Yes Yes,Sgt is it,are you dumb? No,Sgt -Have you done your military service? -Yes,Sgt -Have you been called up before? -Yes,Sgt -Well,how long time? -About 10 months -About 10 months,Sgt,isn't it? -About 10 months,Sgt You should know exactly how long military service you've done Tomorrow I'm going to ask you how long military service you've done and you should answer with certainty -so and so many days,Sgt,is it clear? -Yes,Sgt But excuse me,the cap Take off your cap You must understand that it's not suitable to have the cap on when your officers haven't Did you say something? No,Sgt You,who have done your military service and have done a certain time should know how to request something Now leave and come back and show how this is done what are you waiting for? Carry out No,stop,come back What was that for type of turn around? What? You've seem to have forgot everything! Tomorrow I'm going to force you to do turn around while on march Attention,turn around That was really bad,very bad Look at your feet and you'll see that the heels should be together And we're not waving with the arms during turnaround,attention! Turn around Leave now But in the right manner Execute first a proper turn around Then you go brisk and fast to the door, where you do a new turn around And strengthen up for salutation,and then out,what are you waiting for? Is that really psychological? But what in the hell are you doing! You're not entering a room without knocking the door first,you're certainly not doing that in civilian life? No,Sgt,I've already done that No,you did it recently,now you have an order to do it once more Carry out the order,leave,start again Enter Sgt Two steps distance should it be Two steps back,march OK Now tell me what you want to say And make a real application with a high and distinct voice Sgt,number so and so want to apply and so further,is it understood? Carry on Sgt,971 Cronswärd,apply to report that I've received a too small cap Aren't there any bigger at the stock? No,Sgt Have you tried to exchange with one of your comrades? Yes,Sgt Take on your cap and I'll have a look It is not very becoming but But 971,for the time being,keep it I can't do anything about it at the present time Take off your cap Was it something more? No,Sgt Thanks,Sgt Was that real psychological? Are you supposed to do that Damn you should do it There was a few of the squaddies,who looked like they pretended to be something God damn how I'm going to crush them That fellow 971 Cronswärd I noticed already when he came,that he looked a bit sophisticated that bastard BTW I shall get information which type of fellow he is Yes,hello,this is the Sgt I want you to look up in the General Muster Roll what type of civilian work 971 Cronswärd has Yes,yes,yes,971 Cronswärd,yes What? So he's 36 years old,well, that could be right What? Indeed,aha Yes,thanks That's OK,that's all,finished He's Bachelor of Law and banking clerk in Stockholm and that fellow I'll really dress down Would it not be more appropriate to wait until he has committed an offence? Or are you specially prejudiced against bank employed? Hell no,I don't give a damn what they are But he looked tormented already when he arrived and therefore I shall torment him You mean your work is more satisfying in that case Exactly that You know,I'm not seeking popularity, I find it an honour to be mean I don't mind if they are saying that I'm the worst tormentor of squaddies ever I don't care at all Do you like tormenting others? Of course What? Did it surprise you? I suppose you're joking No,not at all,I'm not joking at all You also think it's a pleasure to torment others,don't you? Yes,perhaps you've not started with it yet but start with it,start with it and you'll see Don't you call that sadism Yes,but that's improper Well,sadism,you know,real sadism would be associated with sexual pleasure And I don't have that happy disposition,probably not you either But,damn,you'd also think that it's a pleasure to have people under your shoes,don't you? It's a pure spiritual pleasure, a completely natural instinct You just laugh but I thought for a moment you were serious I am serious A laughing seriousness Everything on this earth is a joke,isn't it? The military is the the organized super joke,don't you think so? Yes,that has obviously sometimes crossed my mind But then use your possibilities You want to assert yourself vis-à-vis your fellow human beings,don't you? So what? Surely,you've ambition Because you want to assert yourself,don't you? Of course I want that But that doesn't need to be, that I have to torment others But it's inevitable,you see,it's inevitable You want up,that means you want to tramp down others And I'm sure they feel somewhat tormented when they go down,so I'm sure you still want to torment,don't you? And you see that pleasure you can get as officer in command in the army and feel it strongly and refined Just stamp on your subordinates Well,here it's like that everyone is barking at each other,all days long Everyone has somebody whom to bully In that case the most strong pleasure would be found in the commander-in-chief and the newspapers always attack him so he won't get much for that refined pleasure For Jesus sake,you are not asking to be God,are you? Just take every chance you get and thank for it Yes,neither you nor I I don't know of course about your possibilities But at least for me I will never have so many poor wretches under me as now Never in my future life would I be allowed to wander around as I do now and bite without anybody daring to bite back Here is the place where snappishness is rewarded in the duty That situation must be exploited You are damned crazy You should be psychoanalysed I am zealous in the exercise of my duty I keep my troop disciplined I'm not at all crazy and don't need analyse on the contrary I am damned intelligent Yes,I am not that uneducated as you believe,I have I have discussed life's big questions with clever people,you see I am not that bad in philosophy Indeed Life is just Yes,anyone with normal intelligence will soon notice that life is pure hell,right? Eat and be eaten,that's the law Everything is about a common chewing We shall all devour each other, that's the law for all life on earth And the nature is predestined that the meal shall continue for million years Yes,that's it,you know It is like that and you nor me can't do anything about it And in the choice between weeping over the arrangement or accepting it I'll chose to accept And torment merrily a bank clerk from Stockholm No,I am not restrained by any occupation Just wait I'll torment you as well If I want I can make your duty damned difficult,I'm sure you realize that Completely Now you was scared,wasn't you? Oh,no But at least unpleasantly concerned Yes,we could say that I'm accepting everything my appetite to assert myself is not as big as you think That's what you say But deep in her heart,the man has a need to bite his fellow men You see,war is the outlet for man's deep aspiration for it,you see To,to torment his fellow men Therefore war have always existed and will always exist Yes,that's for sure There are some occasional peace periods At that time people will go around and contain themselves but But in the end they will burst saying,damn we have to free ourselves and become human But people like wars how the devil can't it be otherwise possible Listen,think about it Imagine if you were in any big town Let us say Stockholm,Göteborg or Malmö,all towns are the same as you are not recognized, you know,nobody asks for you But if you enter there in a conquering army It's just that which man is dreaming of To put his foot on the neck of the conquered,that tastes like yum,yum You see,torment,kill,shoot,bully to issue prohibitions and still be celebrated for heroism and fulfilment of duty That is To be the Devil And be hailed as God You can't more pleased for having your image of God expressed You're born too late I'm afraid we'll never experience that the Swedish army will march into a conquered city Of course I know that but you have to do your best And in many aspects it's more secure to work on a smaller scale BTW your possibilities to torment are legally restricted Not withstanding that the squaddies can take contra measures What could that be? What? The major is like myself If he rapports about me He's never allowed to strike that devil But I'll tell you he would still screw you up I know what to do,believe me Yes Yes,then you can be left with your indulgences completely uninhibited I think you're ironic,you devil You think that I'm a bit petty,don't you? But you see I'm a philosopher I can see the great in the small things The pleasure is the same whether you lie in a big bed or in a small bed,isn't it? It's the real feeling that's the important thing,you see Not everybody understands that and are fixated on the bed They think the real big personalities are found in the damned big beds It's very interesting views you have expressed You Yes? We shall not forget to draw up a "fotrulla" (i.e. register of inspection of feet of recruits) It's a very important detail Yes,I understand,but so far I haven't found much sense in it But it should be done quite soon Yes,my chap,I shall really make our "Fotrulla" relevant I'll tell the damned bank director that he is suffering from foot perspiration -Does he? -Of course he does Anyway I'll tell him Yes,that will usually embarrass people You can have quite fun with a "fotrulla" and it won't be done in haste as you think -You'll do as you like -Yes I'm doing that You are too comic,sitting there and pretending to be benevolent and noble It must be funny with people who try to deny the true nature of the humans I really think the true nature of the humans is much more complicated than you can imagine You Yes? We are going to have an alarm exercise tonight Indeed Yes You'll raise the alarm at 0130 am And then at the designed location receive the squaddies in full field equipment When you have noticed the time, number and name of the last to arrive You'll let them return to the barracks Understood? And about the last one to arrive you'll write a report I can write it tonight and only fill in the name I wont be guilty for anything dishonourable I'll tell you that once and for all Do you disobey an order from a superior on duty? Not at all Yes,as I know that I'll will be up in the middle of the night I'll go into my room and rest on my bed Stop Go down to the barracks and check that those devils are not smoking there If you find any one,write a report on him You Yes I forbid you in anyway to give any notice to the squaddies about the alarm exercise Do you understand? Yes,indeed I understand completely Yes,it's the Sgt,yes,do you know which ones will be commanded to the kitchen tomorrow? Yes,you should be able to answer that offhand One of them shall be changed and replaced with 971 Cronswärd Is that understood? That's fine End Fifth scene from the human life In the summer villa of the Merchant The son Rolf and Sven,the tutor, are sitting with the textbook Are you ready now? Yes Now tell me what you know about Louis XIV At least you can say something? Who was his father? Louis XIII Yes,that's quite right But who was his mother, do you remember that? She was the queen of Austria You don't mean queen of Austria,do you? She was a princess from Austria and therefore she was called in France,Anna of Austria In which country was she queen? Just say it,it's self evident Austria? -Austria and Hungary? -No,no,no Stop a moment I must have asked in a stupid way,so you think it's more complicated than it is Louis XIV was As you correctly said,son of Louis XIII Louis XIII was married to a princess of Austria who thus was called Anna of Austria The wife of the king of France was,of course,queen of Now you'll say it? Well,it's not a trick question The wife of a king of France Mother to a king of France was of course herself queen of -France -Yes,exactly that Anna of Austria was Louis XIII's queen queen of France and mother of Louis XIV What kind of person was Louis XIV? He was king of France Yes,of course he was but I want to know something about his personality Was Louis XIV an insignificant regent? Yes No,you couldn't say that In the book is written that he was called -Sun King -Right Louis XIV was at the French court called Sun King Then,why was he called Sun King? It was a nickname No,nickname is quite not the right word With the name Sun King they would like to flatter the king,didn't they? Yes What were the qualities in Louis XIV which they wanted to emphasise with their flattery by calling him Sun King? Sun King,what were the qualities in him? What? Was it something in his position which motivated such a name,what do you think? Oh,don't let me bother you What are you doing? We are studying history,at the moment I question Rolf about Louis XIV Yes,please continue, I think I'll listen for a while Yes,Louis XIV was thus Sun King at the French court That he was a significant regent We have agreed upon that But what were the qualities they thought he had common with the sun? Yes,but that's quite natural Yes,but look out of the window Look at the sun,gaze at the sun What is the sun doing now? The sun is setting What? Do you mean that Louis XIV was called Sun King because he was going down? There must be some sense in what you are saying,doesn't it? Yes Maybe he was called Sun King because he got up in the morning? No,he didn't do that He didn't get up in the mornings? Of course he did,he did it in the presence of the court Can I get the book Where is it ? Thanks Whom was Louis XIV son of? Louis XIII Yes,correct guessing Whom was his mother? Queen Anna Yes,that's correct Anna of Austria,what were you discussing? The personality of Louis XIV Now tell me what you know about the personality of Louis XIV? Yes He got up in the morning in the presence of the court Yes,I've heard that, what was that procedure called? What was it that gave such honour for courtiers to be part of? The king's La..King's King's lever(=liver in Swedish) The king's levee,it is in a footnote here how to pronounce it Löve, levee, that you've always read now we had an opportunity to judge your French I've seen your German style,du isst der kind,horrible everything The 16th of Aug today,yes,I can't see how you'll be able to finish this really I don't know how we'll do it Let us see where we were King's,king's levee and the tutor whispered that to me Yes,tell me now what do you know about his personality? That he gets up in the morning is a bit meagre Was he a great regent? -Yes -Indeed? In what way? He conducted several wars Yes,but more? I shouldn't need to pull out every word from you Were the wars successful? No Jesus,not one examiner in the world would accept such answers as you've given,you can never answer yes or no when you have the question about Louis XIV's personality,have you read this? -Yes -Has the tutor supervised the reading? Yes,but perhaps it's best if Rolf read it a few times more Indeed,how many times have Rolf read this chapter? It's four times,isn't it,Rolf? That's today Indeed,ha,ha Of course he's not reading, he just sitting staring And turn the pages You have to read with more attention You have to think of what you're reading Don't you understand that,eh? Can't you grasp that? You have to force yourself,you have to assert yourself -Can't you get that? -Yes Now let us see where we were Mazarin,Mazarin,Mazarin, Mazareng,who was that figure? He was a cardinal Indeed,something more He was minister under Louis XIV Are you sure about that? Yes,it was the cardinal who was actually governing Indeed,why? The king didn't care to govern Yes but this can't be correct I think Rolf now mixes up Louis XIV cardinal Mazarin with Louis XIII and cardinal Richelieu There's no meaning continuing with this Tell me,tutor,do you think it is completely excluded that Rolf can resit his exam? Well,I don't think there are any great chances No,what advice can you give? As Rolf doesn't want to study then I think it would be best for him to be excused Be excused? Be excused? Where will he end up with then? In all professions there is almost some kind of examination Yes,of course,he would have to chose a profession where there's no need for examination Academic eduction is not required everywhere No,no but what do you suggest? Well,I'm sorry,I can't think of an advice straight away But nowadays there are possibilities to test the abilities If Rolf was submitted to a psychological test Or a complete aptitude investigation Then I think we very likely would find what suits him -Indeed,you believe that -Absolutely How does it work? Well,I'm not competent to perform such a test but you submit the person to be tested with certain questions and investigate in different ways memory and combination ability Test the manual skill The way of reacting, the speed of the reactions etc.. That aptitude investigation seems to have common feature with a psychiatric evaluation Yes,only because in both cases psychological tests are involved Ha,ha, you're really naive I can't understand why I should be It is obvious that this science which is quite new is not infallible but there's much evidence that it will change the life in the future Yes,perhaps you believe that it will speed up the social mobility It's possible it'll do that but the main thing is that it will create more happy people Ah,so happy? Well,well If all people found their right place in life then we would have much more really living people than we have now That's undisputable Mr Tutor,I'll tell you one thing in confidence The science is up for sale and one thing more It's usually not very expensive I don't understand at all what the Merchant means A scientific investigation which has been influenced by bribes is of course completely useless so if that is what the Merchant is meaning then I completely agree with the Merchant But I assume that the Merchant has not had time for psychological studies Damn yes,says the Merchant.The tutor should not underestimate us merchants But we don't show off with strange words but for domestic consumption we probably are a bit of psychologist in all of us While the psychologists are talking we are serving our customers and while the economists are writing,we earn our money There is a slight difference between theory and practice It's probably good that some also work so the theorists have something to live off I think I've heard about certain scholarly professors Who during their studies earned their living by giving private lessons to rich lazybones Do Mr Merchant really think this is the ideal situation? Wouldn't be better with a differentiation which would result that all talents in the country would be looked after And those who didn't want to study could be excused The parents of unintelligent children should think more about the happiness of their children But,my dear friend You've no idea about life You've obviously read too much I'll tell you that in every social board who will decide about kids ability is the mean Andersson,the envious Petterson and raving mad Lundström But,of course,you don't believe that But suppose your system could be carried out don't you understand what an infernal devilry you would create With it,there would be no end of the misery Now every human being knows that it's unfair here on the earth And,it's very often a comforting thought,I'll tell Mr Tutor The merchant belongs to the establishment Yes,it's nice when you can think everything is fine as it is No,probably it isn't,but you should take care not to make it even worse If you were allowed free,you'd make life to a torment for many poor creatures I? I really want to be spared preposterous accusations I'm not a conservative reactionary I want a life with more efficient and happier people Yes,yes,yes "Good luck to you" Perhaps we should return to the personality of Louis XIV If there's any idea to torment that slouch,Rolf Sincerely speaking,I think it's meaningless And if Mr Merchant refrained from the idea to use bribery then I think Mr Merchant would get the same advice from all scientifically trained investigators But I don't think I'll use their advice Yes,Rolf,it would be fine to get your way forward without knowledge about Louis XIV's personality and languages,I suppose he must learn in respective countries Well,I suppose there's nothing left for me than to thank Mr Tutor for the time being here There's 18 days left and the study time has been terminated on behalf of Mr Tutor's own request We can say 14 days,which is easier to calculate the deduction of your fees,do you want to leave tonight or tomorrow morning? I'd rather leave as soon as possible Well,then I'll tell them to serve your dinner a bit earlier I have had the not very rewarding task to be Rolf's teacher With the teaching profession follows a certain responsibility I must therefore insist And ask the Merchant to follow the advice I've given him Get to the heart of the matter and don't stay with some half-measures That will save The Merchant many disappointments in the future Yes,yes,thank you so much, thanks,thanks for your kind interest although I won't follow your good advice At least I'll think about them But time is short,I'll not stop Mr Tutor from packing I really hope I'll not miss my train Lazybones Pack your textbooks now Are you satisfied now,are you? Idiot This is what you wanted How shall it be now? End,isn't it? You,you can get a new tutor We can move to a new school, you can attend a boarding-school you can start in the firm,in the warehouse from the beginning You,just cry out,you Are you angry with the tutor,are you? Was he mean to you,was he? But he had also a reason,as lazy as you are,from what I hear Yes,you should be angry Idiot and fool,you only should be called by your parents Occasionally perhaps by your wife Otherwise you'd be really angry, he,he,what do you want now? Dad,I don't want to have my head examined I don't want to be tested I don't want my head examined In two hours time your tutor will be on the train,and you won't see him any more You,BTW,I think it was good that he disappeared I thought he was a real bore,do you hear that? Well,that he was a blowfly I didn't know that until today But now we've conjured him away and with that this story is finished Sixth scene from the human life In Garberg's store Sixten Garberg weighs and wraps a pack for a small girl -Good evening -Good evening -Good day,Mr Rolf -Good day Such a nice weather now Oh,yes We have brought in our last truckload of wheat today We haven't had a single drop of rain on it Yes,now we have nice weather Both for us and the summer guest Now it's the time to swim and have it nice,isn't it? Oh,yes But the gentlefolk will perhaps stay here now until the end of the month? I don't know,we haven't decided yet about it No,I understood that Yes,it can also be dull to go back to the town I mean,here it's now so beautiful,sunny and fine And the gentlefolk also have it nice here? Nice villa,large garden and bathing and a sailing boat and everything That's mighty fine,isn't it? Now it's finished,now let's see One,two,three,four five,six Yes,that's right I've heard that the Merchant has leased new hunting ground Yes,Dad and the Count would get three thousands acres together by that way They want it for the elk-hunt this autumn Yes Yes,the Merchant can really calculate things,can't he? Well,then it'll be a big hunting party this year Then it'll be even bigger than last year Yes,that's possible,it can be fun but many of the old men shoot badly Last year it was close that a general shot one of the beaters I remember that There was lot of talk about it What do you want for such a scarf? 3 and 95,vivid colour and nice,also good quality I have one myself so I can guarantee it stays crisp May I,perhaps,sell one to Rolf? No,God help me from such a bumpkin tie,thanks anyway But I thought that Mrs Svensson was the next Oh,I can wait,I'm not in a hurry so please go ahead and buy the goods, I'll wait here during the time First I want a big pack of Bill (cigarette) Well,a big pack of Bill Please And then I want to ask what's the meaning of this bill Bill? I really can't understand Does Mr Rolf mean that the Merchant has complained about this bill? Yes he has,such tricks don't work with us I can't understand this Surely,it's correct? Indeed,you're saying it, you're saying it's correct Then show it on this bill With receipt,isn't it? Excuse me for a moment and I'll get my scribbling pad Yes,naturally,it wasn't like that we've sent two bills Can you count to two? One and two that's elementary school,first class Yes,excuse me,of course,it's not like that, it's obvious that there are two bills I am very sorry that I've made a mistake we've sent the Merchant this latest bill But it's not the same goods Yes,what I'm saying is that they are the same goods but I mean those delivered,there's two deliveries of the same goods Yes,but that's what Dad is saying It's two bills for the same goods And we don't like that Please,have look here,Mr Rolf understands. Don't tell me that I shall understand Don't tell me once more that I shall understand That's not suitable It is as inappropriate as you standing with your hand in your pocket while talking with my father I must apologize but now I'll try to explain That's only a dating error We have had the pleasure of delivering the same merchandise twice and this last bill has been wrongly dated That was very careless of me but it's obvious we don't want to be paid if the Merchant has mistrust in us If Mr Rolf allows,let me tear this last bill Stop I'm sure Dad would want it As a memory Mrs Svensson is a witness what you've said that you don't want to be paid for the last bill I've got a big pack Bill Don't write two on the bill Good evening That was really rash Oh,how he's grown up and become a big boy,hasn't he? Oh,how he resembles the Merchant Yes,maybe,I didn't have a close look at him But he will finish off being a real gangster Yes,no wonder that they are becoming rich,isn't it? Even though he's rich,he could at least behave like a human being What did Mrs Svensson want? Epilogue The office of the Merchant Present are nine of these figures which have appeared in Scenes from the human life Ladies and Gentlemen I have asked you to come to my office Because of the portrait that Doctor Bo Stensson Svenningson has made of us According to information from my solicitor, a judicial procedure is hardly advisable According to his view we shall try to obtain an amicable solution I've invited Dr Svenningson to be present at this meeting So we can have an opportunity to seek and obtain one for all parts acceptable settlement Ask Dr Svenningson to enter May I introduce Dr Svenningson Yes,and now I'll like to give the floor to Mr Sixten Garberg Why has Dr Svenningson presented me as a simpleton? Shall everybody be allowed to berate me? It was not my fault that Jenny started berating I've never stolen -But it would be.. -Mr Chairman But I suppose I have the floor Mr Garberg has the floor And everyone hears this And Dr Svenningson hears it Should I have married such a person? You think,of course,that she would have suited me,wouldn't she? Everyone spits at me It was not just my fault as much as hers that's nothing came off between us Yes she also consented I'm appealing to the present gentlemen They know how a girl acts and Mr,I mean Dr Svenningson Who at least is a doctor Do you think I should go there out in the countryside and become insane of lust Yes,I should of course have married Jenny otherwise I'm a cad But I must speak up I really must tell her once But I should only be spit and spit at all the time I only have to open my mouth and I'm called a cad I'd like to tell you that I've been treated slanderously and unfairly And I'm rather used to that Aha,Miss Jenny,please What's been said about Sixten is true Every word But it is too nice for such a cowardly brute He told me I was the prettiest girl in the world And he promised me many times that he would marry me Now he lies and says that I wanted it He was after me by hook or by crook He'd never leave me in peace But now I'd never plead and want to marry Sixten Such a cowardly brute who everyone spits at He deserves it But it's the most wicked lie,when the doctor says I stole Eivor's bracelet Because I really never did that I saw it lying in the sand I've no reason to pick up things she mislay She's always been careless Yes,and then when she started boasting about her fiancé and such a nice flat they've got and how swell she's got everything Yes,she did that much more than was written down by the doctor I saw no reason to help her I just wonder if the doctor are helping those who are boasting boldly and let the doctor feel how bad the doctor is Then it's vile to say that it's my fault That Eivor's bloke is an insomniac and a madman Eivor had blabbed me full how he was even before I've even seen him And then when he came and became rude to me Then,certainly,I have to respond? I don't want to be loaded with everything BTW I'm not worse than anyone else It's not fair that I should be disgraced when everybody else are acquitted The doctor should find out how he is himself And be shamed Yes,I would agree with the last thing That I'll fully endorse What is it? It's nothing special I'll just give the floor to you,please,please Yes,thank you I've always said that you should never visit young doctors They don't understand one iota They are only pompous Dr Svenningson You should be ashamed of the way you presented my gratitude for Erik and Eivor's generous kindness to invite their old Aunt Yes,I think you should have some grace for my grey hair And when I advised Eivor how to handle Erik I did this out of profound love But that love and understanding should be met by taunt and mockery you shouldn't expect anything else -That's also in the Scriptures -What? Yes I said it's in the Scriptures You've no feeling for the good, noble and genuine No,you just want to smear and drag down But an old Aunt's dear heart doesn't stop beating because you are foolish and mean If you thought you could separate Erik and his Aunt by this Then you were wrong Shame on you Shame on you I'll really endorse that BTW you resemble Erik But you are more mean -Erik,he's really kind -Thanks,thanks,thank you so much Mr Erik Kind? I'm not kind But surely I'm more kind than Dr Svenningson He's biting,he has rushed around and bitten us all by now And he shall become a psychiatrist He would like to cure people But what kind of help have I got from him? He's not helping us who are suffering Instead he spits on us Yes he does It's not true that I want to dominate and torment others With my insomnia I'm a suffering human being But I demand respect for the suffering And then I hear that my cousin drew villainous conclusions about the truths I informed him about And I think people become even worse When they realize that they are bad It's me who stated that first Perhaps the doctor can't afford to buy himself the Church History Has the doctor never heard that he who seeks the truth should be able to clap on the gate of hell if the road brings him there I wish I was dead No Erik -You are driving me to suicide -Erik don't say that Don't try to calm me and don't speak to me Because then he there says that I'm tyrannizing and tormenting -others with my nerves -as that wasn't the truth You have tormented me a lot,you really have but of course,you were the oldest and such,such a damned swot but also that you were a philosopher and a thinker and a egoist and everything else Yes,yes Now I know that you didn't invent it yourself But of course you pretended then to be original and then went around fermenting with your damned truths,didn't you? Thank you very much It was useful to hear them You yourself is stupid and mad And those strange and circumvent movements Sven seems to have undertaken don't concern me I can't find that I have any part in those I never let him see The only right way,the way which is called go on march And besides I don't give a damn what Mr Svenningson has written It won't make the slightest impression on those I'm dealing with Finish Mrs Eivor Has Mrs Eivor nothing to adduce? No,but thanks for the kindness It has always been that I'm not counted and I think it's best like that Yes,I've never been able to express myself with words Never in writing as well Thank you very much for the kindness,thanks Thanks Mr Sven Dr Svenningson seems to share the view with the merchant that modern psychological research may be used as a method to torment our fellow humans more That view might once have been relevant But I reject with indignation Dr Svenningson's insinuations that I was concerned,influenced or infected by Knut's madness So completely impartial,entirely objective Pure scientifically did I watch my pupil and his father I only said what,according to my opinion,needed to be said Allow me to ask Where would it lead If behind every scientifical statement You started to search for something personal Then you wouldn't be able to trust anything That you sometimes must say awkward truths is inevitable Both the merchant and Dr Svenningson seem to suggest that revealing uncomfortable truths is something pleasurable No,I can at least answer for myself with a resolute no And I'm not at all influenced by the sardonic laugh of the Sgt My laugh is not sardonic You should regard it as an applause, you are lying so damned well Yes,I would like to remind the attendants that discussions between the meeting participants about private opinions in question of details is outside the remit of this meeting Mr Chairman Mr Garberg please May I be allowed a small contribution? Please I hope that the spiteful presentation which Mr Svenningson has made of my mistaken bill is not in any way is misunderstood by Mr Merchant I'm so sorry of my negligence if it has been shown to have caused something and I'd never have mentioned the bill if it was not for once more to ask the Merchant for an apology And I ask to be commended in the Merchant's amiable remembrance As regards the bill we'll draw a line over it And I can assure Mr Garberg that Mr Svenningson won't be the one who will interrupt our agreeable business transactions -I thank you -Please,please Dad I just want to say that Dr Svenningson has also been unfair to me It's true I chattered about our hunting grounds and money BTW what's wrong with that? Dr Svenningson won't claim that I lied You can have a look in the Tax Payer List What was the meaning to present me as childish or as a certain kind of modern youth That's all drivel The grown-ups say exactly the same things The description of my way of handling the bill I have no objections to Dad said I managed that fine Quiet,it's OK for now My Ladies and Gentlemen I refrain for myself to make any detailed commentaries towards the way I've been treated If I want to attach a small reflection to what Mr Svenningson is writing Then it would be that I,in a certain way, have the greatest reason for discontent It's like that we both,Mr Svenningson who is a doctor that we move in circles In the same circles,if I may express myself Nothing impedes that we might meet each other in the social life I don't know if we would do that And sincerely speaking I'm not longing for it at all But it wouldn't be unreasonable or even surprising if we did If you were to write Then I think one should write about people who never read Or more correctly about people with acquaintances who never read I am now asking Mr Svenningson If you agree to pay us an indemnity to be paid in proportion to each one's suffering No,I am really not going to do it I too had a father That's already a reason Having been brought up by a commercial father is anything but unhappiness Even if it is an asset which value you discover gradually I'm saying this to Mr Rolf If I then think that my father was much better than his One can hardly blame me for that No,I have no reason at all to shell out indemnity and consequently I'll not do that Such tricks don't work with us By quoting Mr Rolf To Sergeant Knut Mosterson, I will give an important message Even in medieval morality plays was the devil perceived as a comedy figure End,please I can completely appease Mr Sven's indignation Even those who have the best and most honest intentions just need to be tired or irritated Then he falls down Mr Sven has chosen to perceive the picture I've made of him as an expression of my self-irony Mr Sven should not complain, you've really escaped too lightly No one of the present need to feel harmed by my presentation If somebody will try to embarrass and torment you by references to the scenes in which I've made an attempt to have you featured Just answer only It's not us he's describing It is him If you say so,nobody could say that you are exactly lying People are the same Not only all people in Sweden resemble each other It's the same all over the world I thought for a long time it was different in China But then I made the effort to investigate how the Chinese lived and appeared And it was remarkable how everything seemed so familiar Historical studies also don't offer any bigger surprises There once was A French writer Now,I don't remember his name or even in which century he lived Now he wrote something About the humankind's general characteristics And he did that in a way That it was a risk That both his writing and himself would end up in the bonfire However,the church was satisfied that he explained that he had only written about the human being submerged in the original sin Whereupon he naturally took the opportunity to show his respect for the saved and purified human being It was a sort of equivalent to the conventional toast for "absent friends" I have also completely focused the attention on the human being submerged in the original sin The saved and purified human being is without doubt much much more interesting But it's much more difficult to place her in scenes from human life as she doesn't exist in the material world To emphasise that the sinful human being i.e. the real human being Readily pricks his fellow human with a darning needle can't be a very serious defamation Sometimes the darning needles are replaced with razors And the course is then solemnly called world history I know Just as well as you do That it's agonizing to be a human being submerged in the original sin soiled by the animal instinct The ridiculous And the trivial Our situation is truly deplorable We are living under the worst conceivable spiritual circumstances As a doctor I can attest that We are locked in a room Where the doors and the windows are nailed We would choke If it was not somewhere a secret valve Where this valve is situated And how it is constructed I don't know but it is by this we've got our concepts about fresh air We are all suffering In our human misery And the bitter truth is that That we all are going to die in this But I would be grateful if someone of the present would answer me this question Are the woes of life ameliorated by the wailing of the likes of you? Are the woes of life ameliorated by the wailing of the likes of you? Subtitles by Nostromo
