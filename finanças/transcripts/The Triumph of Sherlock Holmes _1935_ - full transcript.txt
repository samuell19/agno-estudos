Ah, that's good. Hello, Mrs. Hudson. What are you looking for? Haven't you finished packing yet? Not yet, sir. But I'm getting around. Well, be as quick as you can, won't you? Indeed, I will. His things do take a bit of collecting. Well, how about his chemical aberrations? He's very particular about that, you know? He would have packed that himself by now. Really, Holmes, this is too bad. Do you realize that my wife and the rest of the furniture will be here at any moment? I told you, the van that's bringing my stuff is taking all of your things into the country. I'm so sorry, my dear Watson. I was somewhat engrossed in my correspondence. I had no idea that my retirement would cause such a stir. You know, all sorts of people have written to me. Here's an interesting communication, for instance. Well, what's that? It's a telegram of good wishes from our old friend, Abernathy, the forger. Oh, yes. We got him 10 years, didn't we? Uh, yes. Yes. Uh, uh, we did, yes. And when he came out, I was able to render him some slight assistance. You know, I'm not sure, my dear Watson, that of all the kindly messages I have received, even from the most exalted persons, that this is not the most gratifying. Well, I don't suppose they're all regrets at your retirement. No. I imagine there are quite a number of people who will be immensely relieved. Undoubtedly, my dear Watson. Chief among them, another old friend, Professor Moriarty. Oh, ho, Moriarty. Do you know, Holmes, he's the one subject on which I believe you're utterly mistaken. Mm, make no mistake, my dear Watson. That harmless old professor of mathematics? That harmless old professor of mathematics, as you call him, is the brains behind the biggest criminal organization in Europe. You know, my one regret in retiring is that the police neglected to take advantage of the opportunity I gave them of arresting him. I failed to run him to earth. Well, we won't argue about it, Holmes. Oh, I'd better run along and see if the van's left my place yet. Excuse me, Mr. Holmes. There's a gentleman outside. Wants to see you very particular. Oh? What's the gentleman like? He an old gentleman. And very tall. Ask him to come up. Yes, sir. Huh, another well wisher. Come in, my dear Professor. May I point out, Mr. Holmes, that it is a very dangerous habit to finger a loaded revolver in the pocket of one's dressing gown? Just a slight precaution, Professor. As a matter of fact, I half expected a visit from you to satisfy yourself, personally, that I really was going. Your perception, as usual, does you credit, Mr. Holmes. I must confess that, personally speaking, I cannot regret your intention to retire. I can well believe you, Professor. I also feel that from your own point of view, it is a very wise course. In fact, it is the only course possible. I'm afraid I don't quite follow. Do you not, Mr. Holmes? Allow me to refresh your memory. Listen, Mr. Holmes. On the 4th of January last, you crossed my path. On the 23rd you incommoded me. By the middle of February, I was very much inconvenienced by you. And at the end of March, I was seriously hampered in my plans. The situation, in fact, had become an impossible one. Mm-hm. That was my intention. Mr. Holmes, it has been an intellectual treat to cross swords with you. And I say, unaffectedly, it would have been a great treat to me to have been forced to take any extreme measures. Danger happens to be part of my trade, Professor. Danger! It isn't a question of danger, but of inevitable destruction! Therefore, I say again, you are wise to retire. And when you once get to the country, take my advise and stay there! And suppose I should reconsider my decision? You have my warning. I wish you a pleasant and permanent retirement. Now see here, Colonel Moran. How much longer have I gotta wait? Where is this Mr. Moriarty? He's received your message. And he'll see you as soon as it's convenient for him. Dammit, I've been waiting here for three quarters of an hour. Who the devil does he think he is? If I may give you a word of advice, Mr. Balding. I should moderate your tone a little when you meet the Professor. Is that so? Hey, you! Wait a minute! What devil's trick's this? No, devil's trick. I only wanted to prevent your going before I have spoken to you. And who gave you the right to turn a key on me? Huh? We needn't discuss that matter. I understand you have a proposition to make to me. Maybe I have. But maybe I've changed my mind while ya kept me waiting. I'll speak to people when I choose, Mr. Balding. Not to me, ya don't! Unlock that door! Sit down. I said, open that door. Sit down. You're merely wasting time. You traveled here on a false passport. And the American police would be interested to know your whereabouts. So you will do as you're told. Okay, Mr. Moriarty. I understand you represent an American society, which is anxious to remove one of its ex-members who is now living in this country under an assumed name. That is so. And you wish the aid of my organization. What do you propose to pay? $50,000. Reasonable. And now you will tell me all you know about this man. How you traced him to England, when he arrived here, and in what part of the country he was last heard of. Colonel Moran speaking. Yes, he's interviewing the professor now. Yes, we're quite satisfied with his credentials. It's simply a question of whether the professor decides to take up the case or not. I will take up the case, Mr. Balding, on one condition. Yes? That you place yourself entirely in my hands. Carry out my instructions implicitly and obey my slightest order without question. Very well. Good. You will now return to your hotel. You will make no move whatever until you hear from me. When's that likely to be? It may be a week. It may be a month. Rest assured you will hear from me. When I am ready, your orders will be delivered by hand. Do you understand? Yeah, I get ya. Very well. You will now find the door opened. Good day. Okay. I'm relying on ya, Professor. Oh, by the way, don't forget- Going downstairs again, darling? Yeah, I left my glasses in the study. You gonna read then? Yeah, for a little. I don't feel I'm gonna sleep. You've been dreadfully nervy all day, dear. Is anything wrong? No, dear. Nothing. I just don't feel I'm gonna sleep, that's all. I see. - Hello, Jack. - Is anything wrong? No. I laid down my glasses downstairs, that's all. - Goodnight, Roy. - Goodnight, sir. Excuse me, oh! Oh, dear. I'm so sorry, Mrs. Hudson. Is Mrs. Watson coming down with the doctor? Uh, no. No, she isn't. I, I gather that she's too busy in Baker Street. Oh. So it's only you and the doctor? Yes. It's just order of the doctor. Oh! Oh, here he is. Good morning, Holmes. Oh, my dear Watson. I'm delighted to see you. Good morning, Mrs. Hudson. Good morning, Doctor. Well, how are you? Oh, I'm much better, thank you, Watson. You're looking better. I hope Mrs. Hudson's seeing that you have proper meals. Oh, I believe like. Uh, we had a delicious chicken casserole yesterday, didn't we? Yes, and you let it all get cold while you were deducing the age of the chicken. As matter of fact, Watson, it was a tough proposition. I've bit off more than I could chew. Well, go along inside, Watson, have a drink. I know you must need one after your long journey. Yes, I could do with one, thanks. Oh, this is very nice, Holmes. Here, help yourself, Watson. Thanks. Sulfuric acid? You're developing a curious sense of humor, Watson. There you are. It's over there. Well, are you settled in comfortably in Baker Street? As far as I can see, we are. But Mrs. Watson doesn't seem to think so. Oh. Uh, you've been, uh, you've been moving things about a bit. Yes. You've moved your shaving mirror over to the fireplace. Yes, that's right. My wife has her dressing table where we used to have... How did you know? My dear Watson, you're a man of precise habits and considerable regard for your personal appearance. And I observed at once the right-hand side of your face is closely shaved. And the further we get to the neck, then the more careless your shaving appears. Til we come to the angle of the jaw, well, it is positively slovenly. See I, I deduced, therefore, that you had placed your shaving mirror where the light strikes on the right side of the face. The bed must obviously be across the end of the room. Therefore, the fireplace is the only place left which could produce that result. Amazing, Holmes. Elementary, my dear Watson. Elementary. Oh, by the way, I've got a letter for you. Oh, thanks very much. Hm. Hello. This is interesting. Oh? It's a letter from Porlock. Well, who's Porlock? Well, it's rather difficult to say. He's a gentleman of many aliases. He wouldn't be of any importance, except for the fact that , a link in the chain. He's a good way down the chain and not a very good link. Now, look here, Holmes. Please remember that you've retired. Twice he's sent me advanced information that has enabled me to prevent a crime. Whether it was his conscience that made him do it, or a 10 pound note sent to him by devious methods, I have never discovered. What do you make of that, Watson? I won't make anything of it. Put it in the wastepaper basket. There's a good fella. My dear Watson, I'm willing to put anything in the wastepaper basket if I can do so with a clear conscience. I might never forgive myself if I did so in this case. What do you mean? I mean, that something sinister is afoot, Watson. Just cast your eye over that. Obviously in cipher. Ah, how true, Watson. How true. I'm glad you spotted it. Yes, there's only one word, Birlstone. And then there's a series of numbers that obviously represent other words. They're probably taken from some book. Now the point is, what book? Well, why doesn't the fool tell you? Oh, my dear Watson. Send the key of the cipher in the same envelope as the cipher itself? - Oh. - Oh, no, my dear fellow. The key will probably follow in another envelope. And meanwhile, it might be instructive if we try to decipher this ourselves. Now the cipher message begins with the number 534. Uh, huh. Well, that's probably page 534. That means we've got a large book. The next line is C2. What do you make of that, Watson? Chapter Two, of course. Well, hardly that, Mr. Watson. What size book would it be if Chapter Two were on page 534? Oh. Well, a column then. Brilliant, Watson. Brilliant. Really, you're scintillating this morning. Now we've got a large book, printed in double columns. Any other suggestions? The Bible? My dear Watson, you, you excel yourself. Didn't I remark just now, Porlock is one of Moriarty's men? And I can hardly imagine any less likely book in his possession than the Bible. Hm. No, the Bible has too many editions. No. No, this must be a standardized book. And page 534 would be the same in all copies. Uh, try again, Watson. Well, how about Bradshaw? Or the ABC's. Well, that's a good idea, Watson. But, uh, if I may say so, it's not quite good enough. I know. Whitaker's Almanack. Mm, mm. Now come along. And let's see what page 534 has in store for us. Just write this down. Danger. Good, Watson, good. You got that down? - Yes. - Capital. Owner Birlstone Castle. Well, what's it mean? It means, Watson, that some devilry is brewing against the owner of Birlstone Castle. Excuse me, Mr. Holmes. Here's Inspector Lestrade. - Oh, hello. - Good morning, gentlemen. Good morning, Lestrade. I told him he wasn't to come right in, Mr. Holmes. But he said he'd arrest me if I didn't let him in. - That's all right, Mrs. - Hudson. That's all right. You understand, Inspector, that Mr. Holmes has retired? You're not going to drag him up to London. Oh, no, sir. I wasn't thinking of doing that. I called in to ask Mr. Holmes if he'd be good enough... Birlstone? Well, what's this, Mr. Holmes? This is magic. That's a cipher that Watson has just solved. Well, what's the matter, Inspector? Matter? Only that Mr. Douglas of Birlstone Castle was horribly murdered last night. - What? - Shot. Face completely blown away. So Porlock's message came too late. Porlock? Who's Porlock? And how can he prophesy murders? Camberwell post marked. Well, that doesn't tell us much. It tells you as much as you'll ever know, Inspector. I used to send him money to the Camberwell Post Office. Well, didn't you find out who called for it? No. No, I promised not to try and chase him. I, I gather he was of rather a shy, no, not to say retiring disposition. Well, we can't waste anymore time. Will you come over to Birlstone with me, Mr. Holmes? On the way, I'll tell you all I know. Oh, we're not going far then? About, uh, 20 miles. You'll be back for lunch. I forbid it! I'd sooner go myself than let you go. Excitement's bad for you. I appeal to you, Inspector, he really ought not to go. My dear Watson, I appreciate your thought in this. I wouldn't dream of going if I were not convinced that Moriarty is behind all this. Not your Professor Moriarty? - Yes, Lestrade. - Professor Moriarty. My dear Mr. Holmes, you're beginning to see his hand in everything. Porlock is one of Moriarty's men. Now look here, Lestrade. I'll bet you my new bee hive to your old bowler hat, that you'll find that Moriarty is behind this Birlston affair. - All right, I'll take you. - Good. Hm. This is an estate well back into the past, Watson. I suggest these are the remains of the old, uh, outer fortification. Yes, obviously. Well, I suggest, Mr. Holmes, that we should do better to go inside and view the scene of the tragedy. My dear Lestrade, I always think it wise to get one's bearings before proceeding into, uh, deeper waters. Lestrade, I observe that this moat has only recently been filled with water. Oh? How on earth do you know that, Holmes? Really, Watson what kind of a tree is it that comes to maturity and blossoms in water? No, no, no, no. This water is a recent addition. Makes it much more difficult to get out of the window. - Yes. - Yes, Watson. Or to get in. Possibly Mr. Douglas anticipated this crime. Ah, Inspector Griffith, this is Mr. Sherlock Holmes. How do you do, sir? How do you do? Ahem. Oh, this is my friend, Dr. Watson. How do you do? How do you do? Well, shall we get in? By all means, Inspector. This is what it was done with, Mr. Holmes. I found it lying just there. There was no signs of a struggle except the peculiar position of that chair. I see. Now, tell me, who else besides Mr. Douglas was in the house at the time of the tragedy? Uh, Mrs. Douglas and Mr. Cecil Barker, a friend of the family. Here you are, Mr. Holmes. Dear me, these are dreadfully dirty. Must have been at point blank range. Whoever did this, didn't intend to miss. Well, one could hardly miss with a sawn off shotgun. American. Pennsylvania Small Arms Company. You'll observe that the triggers are wired together. So he got both barrels at once. And what do you make of this card, Mr. Holmes? V.V. 341. It was found pinned to the body. Rough cardboard. It was not written in this room. See this was down with a broad nib. These are fine. Well, what does it mean, Holmes? You say the draw bridge is raised every evening? Yes, about sunset. And the tragedy occurred about half past 11:00? Yes. Obviously suicide. We thought that at first, sir. Until someone pointed out this. - What is it? - A foot mark? Yes. Someone must have gone out of that window. Who pointed this out? - Did Mr. Barker, sir. - Oh. - Blood! - Yes, his shoes must have been covered in blood from the state of the room. He undoubtedly swam the moat. Hardly. It's not more than three feet deep anyway. Oh. And you've observed, of course, that someone has been hiding here. Hm? There are distinct marks of muddy boots. Uh, when were these curtain drawn? At dusk. Oh. So the man must have got in after the curtains were drawn and before the bridge was raised. Yes, but I observed when I arrived that the moat doesn't extend right around the castle. There's a ruined tower at the end of the building that's accessible without crossing the draw bridge. Yes, but the only way from the tower to this part of the house is through this solid oak door, which is always kept locked. Is it? By Jove, Holmes. It doesn't seemed to be locked now, does it? - Well, that's funny. - I always understood- - Yes, we'll return to that later. But meanwhile, I must ask you to make no reference whatever to it. Now I think we'll have another look at the body. Oh, and I should like to have a word with that Mr. Cecil Barker. Very good, sir. What do make of this curious mark on Douglas' forearms, then? Do you think it's a sign of some secret society? How would you say this was done, Watson? It isn't tattooing. No, it's a brand. It's been done with a red hot iron. Very painful. Mr. Barker, this is Mr. Sherlock Holmes. How do you do? I'm very glad you were able to come, Mr. Holmes. Ahem. Oh, uh, this is my friend, Dr. Watson. How do you do? How do you do? Now, Mr. Barker, I understand you discovered the body. Yes. I heard the shot and came straight down. Poor Douglas was lying where you see him now. A lighted candle was on the table. Oh, this candle? Yes. And you gave the alarm immediately? Yes. I rang the bell for Ames. That's the butler. And a minute later he came in. So that within two minutes of the murder Ames was in this room? Yes. What is the first thing he did? He put that lamp he was carrying on the table and, uh, blew out the candle. As a matter of fact, I was here so quickly myself after the shot, that I must actually have been in the room while the murderer was escaping through window. Why do you say, through the window? Because there's no other way out. That door to the tower is always locked. But we've just discover- - Now, tell me Mr. Barker, did Mrs. Douglas come in here after the tragedy? No. I was able to stop her just in time. How long have you known Mr. and Mrs. Douglas? About a year. I met them when they first came to Switzerland from America. And how long have they been here? About, uh, nine months. Hm. You don't know anything about, uh, Douglas' past life? Only that he used to live in Chicago. You never heard him speak of any secret society? Funny you should mention that. He never told me about it himself, but I always got the impression that he, he was a member of one, or an ex-member. You don't know what that mark on his arm was? No. I've seen it often, of course. But he never told me what it was and I never liked to ask him. It was one of the things that rather made me wonder about that secret society. Anything odd about his behavior at any time. Well, he hated meeting people. In Switzerland, he hardly ever moved from his chalet in the mountains. Kind of made me wonder if somebody was after him. When he suddenly packed up and bolted to England, it made me wonder all the more. Come in. Excuse me, sir. But Mrs. Douglas would like to see Mr. Holmes when he's finished his investigation in this room. Most certainly. Uh, Mr. Barker would you be good enough to tell Mrs. Douglas that I'll be with her in a minute? - Oh, Ames? - Yes, sir. As you're here, you may as well answer a few questions. Very good, sir. Uh, regarding the tragedy, did you hear the report of the gun? No, sir. You know what these old houses are. Walls are a mile thick. - Now, Ames. - Yes, sir. When you entered the room, this candle was alight, I understand. Yes, sir. - Where would Mr. - Douglas have got it from? His bedroom, sir. I had orders to see that one was always on his bedside table. And you put this one there yourself? Yes, sir. I remember he told me his old one had burned right down, so I put in a new one. Oh, it was a new one”? Yes, sir. It hasn't been re-lit since the tragedy? No, sir. I'll vouch for that, sir. Ah. Did these candles come out of the same box as that one on the table? Yes, sir. Yes. Yes, thank you. Uh, have there been any strangers about the place lately? No, sir. Oh, wait a minute! An old gentleman did call a little while back to look over the ruined parts. But we often have people come to see that. It dates from the Norman conquest. Quite. Quite. So there's nothing more that you can tell me, eh? No, sir. I can't make head nor tail of the whole thing. - Hm. - Fairly beats me. And the wedding ring being missing, too. Wedding ring? Didn't Mr. Barker tell you? Not a word. What about the wedding ring? The master always wore a plain gold wedding ring under the one with the rough gold nugget on it. Under? Yes, sir. I never saw him without it. And for the murderer to take that and leave the other seems so strange, doesn't it? Yes. Yes. Oh, there's just one more question then. Did your master ever do exercises in the morning? Yes, sir. Every morning. Hm. As regularly as clockwork. Oh, very good. Thank you. Will that be all, sir? Yes, thank you. Well, Mr. Holmes, the most important point so far is that obviously this has something to do with a secret society. On the contrary, my dear Lestrade. I suggest that the most important point so far is that Mr. Douglas did exercises every morning. You can't be serious, Mr. Holmes. Mark you, I don't mind you asking all these questions about exercises and candles. But I can't see how they help to clear up what we're investigating. I suppose, Lestrade, you're quite clear in your mind what you are investigating. - The murder of Mr. - Douglas, of course. Ah. Capitol, capitol. I've told Mrs. Douglas that Mr. Holmes will see her. Thank you. Now I would like to ask you one or two questions if you don't mind. Inspector? Did you know Mrs. Douglas before her marriage? No. But you've seen a good deal of her since? What are you suggesting? I've seen a good deal of him. I'm not suggesting anything. I'm here to get facts. Did Mr. Douglas entirely approve of your friendship with his wife? I refuse to answer! I suppose you realize that your refusal indicates that you've something to hide? I've got nothing to hide! I can't help what it indicates to you. Now, look here, sir. It won't do any good to adopt that attitude. All right. I'm sorry. I know you're only doing your duty. As a matter of fact, I may as well tell you. Poor Douglas didn't have one fault, and that was jealousy. He liked my being here, but if Ettie, that's Mrs. Douglas, and I had too much to say to each other, he used to go off the deep end and say the wildest things. But I assure you that no man ever had a more faithful wife than Ettie, or a more loyal friend than I. No doubt. Still, the fact that his wedding ring is missing rather suggests that the marriage and the tragedy were, in some way, connected. I have no idea what it suggests. And if you're insinuating there was anything between me and Mrs. Douglas, you're on the wrong track, that's all. I don't think I have anything more to say to you. Any more questions, Mr. Holmes? Uh, not at the moment, Lestrade. No. It dimensionally adds to the zest of an investigation when one is in conscious sympathy with the historical atmosphere of one's surroundings. May I commend this little book for your attention? "History of Birlston"? Ha! I've got something better to do than to read that sort of stuff. Ah. Well, that, that's a pity, Lestrade. That's a pity, because you'd see here that this castle was erected in the fifth year of the reign of James I. And there are various associations of interest connected with this ancient building. I don't doubt it, but that's got nothing to do with us. Breadth of view, my dear Lestrade, is one of the essentials of our profession. Yes, well, as you don't seem to agree with me, perhaps we had better go and see Mrs. Douglas. Ah, that's better. I'll show you the way. You can remove the body. Very good, sir. Ettie. You've met Inspector Lestrade. This is Mr. Sherlock Holmes. How do you do, Mr. Holmes? How do you do? Ahem. Oh, may I present my friend, Dr. Watson? How do you do? It was good of you to come, Mr. Holmes. Not at all. I hope I may be of service to you. Won't you make yourselves comfortable? Well, I think I shall leave you now. If you want me, I shall be in the garden. Now, Mrs. Douglas, I wonder if you can give us any help? I wish I could, but I didn't see the tragedy. Yes, so I understand. But you heard the shot. Now how long after that were you stopped on the stairs by Mr. Barker? A couple of minutes. I just had to put on a wrap and some slippers. Hm. How long had your husband been downstairs before you heard the shot? Two or three minutes, not more than five. Where were you married, Mrs. Douglas? In New York. Ah, in America. Have you ever suspected there was some danger threatening your husband, and that he knew it? Yes, I have. In fact, I'm sure of it. But he wouldn't talk about it. Not that there wasn't complete love and understanding between us. But, well, it's just that he didn't want me to be worried. You know nothing of his life in America that could have caused that threatening danger? Nothing at all. That mark on his arm, do you know what that is? No. You never asked him? Yes, I did once. But he refused to discuss it, so I never asked again. You've no idea what it is? None whatsoever. Can't you suggest anything? Mrs. Douglas, I suggest that you tell me the truth. Mr. Holmes! You know perfectly well what that mark is. You couldn't possibly have lived in America without knowing. That mark is the brand of the Scourers. The Scourers? Yes, an American secret society which terrorized the coal district of the Vermissa, and which was broken up some years ago. Well, I'm bound to admit, Holmes, I've never heard of them. No, I can well believe that, Watson. But I can't believe that Mrs. Douglas has never heard of the Scourers, because her husband was one. All right, Mr. Holmes. I'll tell you the truth. I think that would be the wisest course. I'll tell you a story of Vermissa Valley, the Valley of Fear. Two years ago, I lived at Vermissa with my father. We used to take in boarders, occasionally. Then one evening I went down to the depot to collect a package and I met a young man who had just come off the train. His name was Murdock and he was looking for lodging. The minute I set eyes on him, I knew he was the one man in the world for me. I told him about our place. And he said he'd call later. That evening, while I was clearing away supper, I heard a knock at the door. So you've turned up Mr. Murdock. I sure have. I Try to make it a habit to keep my word. Who is that, Ettie? Someone to see you about a room, Dad. Ettie. So that's your name, is it? Mine's Jack. This is Mr. Murdock. He wants to board with us. Yeah, it would suit me fine. Well, take your things off. Thanks. I dare say we can fit you. $20 a month are the terms. Well, that's all right with me. I better give you my first month. Okay. Will you come into the sitting room? Yeah, surely. Well, this looks pretty good to me. Won't you sit down? You know, I don't think I'm gonna feel homesick. Oh, we'll try to make you comfortable. Don't you worry, Ettie. This is gonna to be more like home than any place I've been in since I've come to the States. Oh, you're not American then? No. As a matter of fact, I was born in England. But, uh, I've been here the best part of my life. Oh. Why, hello, Ted. I didn't expect you so early. Yeah. So it seems. Who's the boyfriend? Our new boarder, Mr. Murdock. This is Ted Balding. Well, Mr. Boarder, I suppose you figure you got things fixed up pretty good here, eh? Yeah, that's the idea. Any objection? No. Come here. Come on, get a move on. But I've been a boarder myself, so I'll put you wise. Ettie belongs to me. She's sweet on me. Get me? Well, there's no accounting for taste. So you're one of these fresh guys, eh? Well, don't get fresh with me, that's all. Ted, please. Jack didn't mean anything. So it's Jack, is it? It's come to that already, eh? I think if you were to leave us alone, Ettie, we might get this thing straightened out. Listen! I know how to get this thing straightened up. You know what that means? No. And I don't care. Well, you can take it from me, ya will. I'll be here tomorrow night, and I'll expect to find ya gone. I wouldn't bet on that, if I were you. You'll be sorry you ever came here, before I'm through with ya. Get out. Why, you're not going, Ted? Say, Ettie, what's the matter with Ted? - Oh, he's sore at Mr. - Murdock being our new boarder. Sorry you should have a scare on your first night, Mr. Murdock. Scare? You don't think I'm scared of that, do ya? Most people are. Well, I'm not. Who the devil is he, anyway? He's one of the bosses of the Scourers. The what? The Scourers, a society of murderers and blackmailers. The Ancient Order of Freeman, they call themselves. Ah, baloney. The Freeman have been found in every town in this state. It's a society of a charity and good fellowship. Not here, it ain't. It's just a murder gang. Well then, why don't they bring them to justice? Tell me that. Because no one dares give evidence against them. Juries don't dare to convict. The judge has to do as he's told, and the police are all square. Say, you're just trying to kid me. I don't believe a word of it. Aren't there 50 murders to prove it? Is there a man or woman in the valley who doesn't believe it? Well, you don't scare me. You see, you don't know me. And you don't know McGinty and his gang! McGinty, eh? Huh! That's queer. I've got a date with that guy this evening. McGinty? What have you got to do with McGinty? Well, I've got to report to him. You see, I happen to be a Freeman, myself. What? What? You a Freeman? Then you don't stay here another minute. Here. Here's your $20 back. I wouldn't have ya for $100 a week. But you can't turn him out now. Oh, can't I? I'm telling you, I got no use for these Freemen. It's bad enough to have one hanging around Ettie. I'm not going to have another for a boarder. You get outta here tonight. Well, tomorrow morning. I'm sorry. That's all right. But don't make any mistake, I'll be seeing a lot of you. - It's no good. - With Ted Balding- - Tell me, Ettie, you're not in love with Balding are you? You're only afraid of him. If you'd have met me first, would I have had a chance? I wish you had been the first. That's all I wanted to know. Oh, Jack, I'd never believe anything bad of you, not whatever happens. Well, I wouldn't be too sure of that, Ettie. Still, even a guy like me can be on the level with a woman. Well, I'll be getting down to McGinty's. Whiskey. Well, stranger. I don't seem to call your face to mind. No, I'm new here, McGinty. Counselor McGinty to you. Well, I'm sorry, Counselor. I was told to come here by Brother Scanlin, Assembly 341 Vermissa. I drink to your health and our better acquittance. Oh, it's like that, is it, Mr. Uh- - Murdock. I shall have to look a bit closer into this, Mr. Murdock. We don't take people on trust in these parts. Let's have a little talk in private. Yeah. Do you mind, uh, stepping through that door there? Look here, my joker, if I thought you were playing any games on us, it would be a short script for ya. Huh! A strange kind of welcome for a brother. Where were you initiated? Assembly 29, Chicago. What are you dong here? Looking for work. Why did you leave Chicago? I can't tell you that. Why not? Because the rules say that one member can't tell another a lie. Oh, you mean, the truth's too bad to tell, eh? You can put it that way if you want to. Now listen here, mister, you can't expect me, as boss, to let into this assembly any man for whose past I can't answer. Say, you wouldn't squeal if I showed you something, would you? I oughta wipe manners across your face you talk to me like that! I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way. Oh. Here. Take a look at that. Oh. Your work? Sure. Why'd you shoot this guy, Pinto? Well, he threatened to squeal on me. So I croaked him and beat it out here. You thought a murderer would be welcome out here, eh? Yeah, you've said it. You ought to go far. You look like being a pretty useful bullet to us. Didn't flinch when I put the gun on you, either. You were the one in danger, boss. I got you covered from the first. And I guess my shot had been as quick as yours. So you got here first, did ya? I want to have a word with you about this man. Yeah, you say it right now while I'm here. I'll say it how and when I please. I'm content to leave it to you to judge between us, Counselor. Well, what is it? Well, a young lady. I think she's free to choose for herself. Is she? As a free member of the assembly, I should say she was. Well, that's your ruling, is it? Yes, it is. Were you thinking of disputing it? You'd back a newcomer against me, would ya? Well, you're not boss for life, Jack McGinty. And let me tell you this. When it comes to the voting. You've been asking for it a long time, Balding. Now you've got it! I got nothing against you, boss. All right. Now, we cant' have bad blood between brothers. Go along in the bar, and I'll buy ya both a drink. We've not met before. You're the new captain? You've guessed it. I'm Captain Marvin. Well, we could do without ya. Police enough of our own without importing any. Hello, here's an old acquaintance. Well, I'm no friend of yours or any other cop. You're Jack Murdock of Chicago, all right. And don't deny it. Well, I'm not denying it. Why should I be ashamed of my name? Well, you ought to be. What the devil do you mean? Ah, you can't pull that stuff with me. I'm Marvin of Chicago Central. We haven't forgot the shooting of Jonas Pinto. I never shot Pinto. Nice impartial evidence. As it happened, we couldn't get it in any case against you. So you're okay with me, just as long as you're on the level. Get me? Good night. Well, boys. Here's a new brother from Chicago. We'll just have drinks all around and then we'll swear him one and truly into the assembly. We got a special initiation here in Vermissa Valley. And you can't be one of us till you've been through it. That's okay with me. Okay. Bother Murdock, can you bear pain? As much as anyone, I guess. Well done, Brother. Now one last word. You'll obey my rulings at all times. And the penalty for breach of faith is inevitable- - I understand. Well, boys, we must get to the business of the evening. There's a man in this town who needs trimming. And it's up to you to see that he gets it. I'm speaking of James Stanger, editor of the "Herald." You've seen how he's been panning us again in his dirty rag. Yeah! Why don't we bump him off? That might cause more trouble than we need ask for. But I guess you can give him a pretty severe warning. Will you take care of that, Balding? Sure thing. I'll take Van Shultz along with me. And you, Mansel, and, uh, you, Goller. Okay. And, yeah! You'd better come along with us, Murdock. We'll see the kind of stuff you're made of. That's okay with me. Come on, let's go. - Come on! - What you- - Come on, won't ya. Hey, lay off. He just needed to be warned. Hey, who the hell are you- - Stand back or I'll blow your face off. The boss said he wasn't to be killed, didn't he? - Yeah, that's so. - Lay off, Balding. Come on! Oh. I'm sorry, Counselor. I'm not much of a visitor, Murdock. But I thought I'd stretch the point in your case. I'm honored, but how did ya know I was here? I only came this morning. It should be enough for you that I do know. It may be enough for most men, but not for me. Say, you're a queer guy. Scanlon told me, if you must know. He lives here, too, Thursdays. Yeah. Have a drink. Sure. I thought you'd be getting into trouble, Mr. crooked Murdock of Chicago. Look, he's a friend of mine. And I'll answer for his conduct. Well, what am I being accused of? Beating up old Stanger of the "Herald" last night. Not your fault it isn't a murder charge. Say, I can bring a dozen men to prove he was playing poker with me. You'll not be able to hold him, Captain Marvin. I wouldn't bet on that. Take him away, boys. Any funny business, shoot him. Order in the court! Do you find the prisoner, John Murdock, guilty or not guilty? Not guilty. Court adjourned. You see? I told you you needn't worry. You see, Mr. Holmes. I had fallen desperately in love with Murdock by this time. Broke my heart to find him going from bad to worse, but he was always straight with me. I see. And was Murdock taken completely into the confidence of the Scourers? Yes. In six months, his name was a by-word in the valley. People were as scared of him as they were of McGinty. Pray proceed, Mrs. Douglas. One night, he and another man were sent to shoot one of the most respected pit managers in the valley. I felt something awful was going to happen. I didn't know just what. Tell the boys to scram. Okay, boss. Now then, Balding. As soon as we get this going, you come back to these bushes and cover the door. Uh, huh. He's got to come out when he finds the place alight. And where are you going? Don't be a sap. I've got to cover the back, haven't I? - Come on, let's go. - Okay. Come on, they're shooting at us. Must be the police. - I know, they got me. - Well, come on, then. Oh! I'm sorry, Ettie. I, I didn't hear you come in. What's the matter, Jack? Why you so scared of me? I'm not scared, honey. I was just thinking of other things, that's all. Oh, no. It's more than that. Let me see the letter you were writing. A letter? Yeah, the one you're trying to hide from me. No, I can't do that. It's secret, you see. Business of the society. You know, when you come in, I thought you might have been a detective. Oh, Jack, can't you give it up? That's what I've come to ask you. I heard about last night. Can't we get away from this terrible place? This Valley of Fear? No. I can't do that right now. They'd never let me get away, knowing as much about them as I do. Still, maybe in six months time I could find a way. Six months? Is that a promise? Perhaps, eight months. Anyway, within the year. Oh, darling. You see, I felt happier after his promise. And did he keep his promise? Did you leave in six months? It wasn't a matter of months, Mr. Holmes, but hours. That same afternoon, I was just going upstairs when I heard someone come to the door. What's the matter, Jack? Trouble afoot. The police? Yeah. A Pinkerton detective. Now that don't mean anything to you, I know. But I'm too deep in this thing. I've got to get out, tonight. And you want me to come with you? Yeah. I'm a strange sort of Romeo for a kid like you, but I'm on the level with you, Ettie. And we quit tonight? Sure. Is there any danger? Maybe we can stall the danger off. Maybe we can't. Anyway, you be ready in case I come for you. I will, Jack. Boss, I got some bad news. What sort of bad news? Well, I can't tell ya in public. Let me collect a few of the boys and go into your room and discuss it. Okay. Carry on. Odie, Carmichael, you go. Garth, Mantel, come into the bosses room, will ya? Yeah, and you too, Willoughby. Okay. Boys, I've discovered something. Well, what is it? There's a fella called Birdy Edwards among us. Well, he's a Pinkerton detective, and he's collecting evidence against us that will send us all to the gallows. You sure of this? Yeah, you can take it from me, but I'll give you the details later. Anyone know this guy by sight? Sure, I do. But if we act quick, we've nothing to fear. We got nothing to fear, anyway. What can this man know about our affairs? Well, I hope you're right. But he's got the code on there's millions at his bank. Don't you suppose there may be some weak member among us who can be bought? Maybe he's got our secrets already. No, there's only one cure. That he never leaves the valley alive! For the first time, Balding, you and I agree. Well, do you want me to handle this, boss? Sure, but you better tell us some more about it. Well, the other day, I met a fellow who said he was a press man. And he offered me good money for inside stories of the Scourers. Although his face was familiar, somehow or other, I couldn't place him. I know now that that was Birdy Edwards. I made a few inquiries and found out he was living at a place called Hobson's Patch under the name of Steve Wilson. Well, we'll just bump him off, quick. No, I've got a better plan than that. Well, what is it? I'll go over to Hobson's Patch this afternoon and locate him. I'll tell him I'm a Scourer. And I'll offer him the secret papers of the society for a price. Only, as I can't hand them to him in the street, he's got to come to my place to collect them. That'll fetch him. Well? Well, surely you can handle the rest yourself. Only, once Mr. Birdy Edwards comes to my place, I don't think he'll leave it again alive, somehow. Oh. Well? - He's coming. - Good. Come on in. Make yourself at home, boys. Do you think he knows much? Well, he's been here six weeks. He may have passed on quite a bit. But we'll make him tell us all about it. We'll have the truth out of Mr. Birdy Edwards if we have to cut his heart to get it. Did he seem to tend a trap? No, I got him on a weak point. Told him I'd show him all the papers of the Scourers. Well, if we handle it right, they'll never be able to prove a killing. Nobody will see him come up to the house after dark. And I'll lay odds, nobody will ever see him leave. Now here's the plan. You boys all stay here, see? Birdy Edwards will be pretty heavily armed, so we got to take him by surprise. He's gonna knock three times. I'll go out, open the door, let him come in. I'll leave him in the outer hall while I come in here and get some papers or something and, and give you the tip. I'll go back. And while he's reading the papers, I'll get the gun off him. Then I'll give a shout. And the sooner you come in, the better. You're the one to handle him. Not one word of warning does he get till the murderer has his hand on his throat. Okay, man. Pity you haven't got shutters on your windows. - Don't you worry. - We won't be spied on. Perhaps he won't come. He's as eager to come as you are to see him. He may be here any minute. Now keep quiet. Not a movement till I give you the sign. Now, you make yourself at home, I'll get them right away. Well, is he here? Is Birdy Edwards here? Oh, he's here, all right. I am Birdy Edwards. I'll get you for this, you rotten coward! Get 'em up! There are 40 armed men around this place, so you can figure out what chance you've got. You dirty, stinking, double-crosser. There's something I'd like to say to you fellas before we part. Next time we meet, you'll all be in the dark. Well, I can put my cards on the table, at last. I am Birdy Edwards of Pinkerton. I played a pretty dangerous game in breaking up your gang. And no one knew I was playing it, except Captain Marvin, here, and my employer. You think the game is all over, don't you, Mr. Clever Guy? Well, let me tell you this. You'll be hunted down wherever you go to. The Scourers will get you, even if you go to China. Yeah? Well, I'll take a chance on that. You all fell for my supposed criminal record, just as I thought you would. I've stopped as many crimes as possible. How many times have you fellas been to get your man and found he's gone to some place else? Well, that was my doing. Your arm, that was my doing, too. Only I was just too late to save a man's life. But when I found the secret was coming out, well, I got to act quick. And so I'm able to hand over to Captain Marvin the worse gang of murderers this country has ever known. Hand picked by me. I told you when you joined us, the penalty for breach of trust is inevitable death, and you'll find that's true. Take 'em away, boys. Well, Birdy, the boss will be pleased. You sure got results. Yeah, but I wouldn't go through all this again for all the money in the States. That's the whole story, Mr. Holmes. McGinty and a dozen others went to the gallows. And Ted Balding, one of the very worst, got off with life imprisonment. Well, do you think this is Balding's work? Obviously. Obviously. I'm certain of it, too. We wandered around and finally settled in Switzerland. And then one day, my husband got a cable saying that Balding had broken jail and he was believed to be in Europe. My husband must have got wind of something, because we packed up in a few hours. And now- I see. McGinty proved himself to be right. Yes. Oh, Mr. Holmes, if you'll pardon me, I'll go and get some fresh air. This has all been terribly upsetting. Naturally, Mrs. Douglas. Well, that's all as clear as crystal, Mr. Holmes. All we've got to do is to find Balding, and that shouldn't be difficult. Ah! They may even have got him by now. Well, I'm going to slip over to the station for a few minutes. I suppose you won't be leaving just yet, a while. Uh, no. Uh, with your permission, no, not yet. That's all right. I'm afraid you've lost your bee hives, Mr. Holmes. Nevertheless, you'll oblige me by taking care of that bowler hat of yours, Lestrade. Well, didn't take us long to solve that. And I, I'm sorry for Mrs. Douglas. A strikingly pretty woman, don't you think? No, you see, I, I didn't notice. Really, Holmes. There's something positively inhuman about you at times. My dear Watson, I never allow my judgment to be biased by personal qualities. I can assure you that the most winning woman I ever knew was hanged for poisoning three little children for their insurance money. Oh, I see. Oh, Ames? Yes, sir. Is there anything I can do for you? Now, you said your master used to do exercises. Uh, did he use dumb bells? Yes, sir. One or two? Two, of course. And you said he used them every morning. Uh, what about yesterday? Yes, sir. I remember him doing them. Uh, where? Down here? Yes, sir. He used to say he liked plenty of elbow room. Yes. Yes, thank you, Ames. Thank you. Will there be anything more, sir? No, no. No, nothing more. Seriously, Holmes, this is all very simple. What's to prevent our going home to lunch? Well, I'm rather concerned about the missing dumb bell, Watson. Dumb bell? Yes. Yes, I'm not referring to the good Lestrade. Whom I'm aware he's gone to the station. But an equally solid article used for developing the muscle. One usually looks for them in pairs, my dear Watson. I can only account for one. No, this is by no means a simple case. And what complicates it still more is where does Moriarty come in? He doesn't. Balding murdered Douglas. And it's Lestrade's job to find him. My dear Watson, you appear to have forgotten that only this morning we decoded a message from one of Moriarty's men foretelling this tragedy. Oh, yes, of course. So we did. Well, what's the next step, Holmes? You can lend me your umbrella. Umbrella? Yes. But it's not raining. How true, Watson. How true. Nevertheless, I should like it. You brought the one with the crooked handle, didn't you? Yes, I left it in the hall. But that's a wretched weapon, Holmes. Take my revolver. Oh, no, no, no, my dear fellow. There's no danger. If there were, I'd ask for your help. No, no, I'm not, uh, thinking of doing any shooting, Watson. Just a, just a little fishing. - Fishing? - Yes. Yes, I, I want to see what the moat has to offer us. Oh, I see. Fishing! I'll go fetch it. - Ah, thank you, Watson. - There you are. Thank you. Oh, by the way, where did Mrs. Douglas go when she left us? To the, I saw her from the window. She was heading straight for the pergola. Ah, as I thought, Watson. She's probably talking things over with Barker. Now look here, Watson. I want to be sure they don't come back to the house for a few minutes. Will you, like a good fellow, keep an eye on them, and let me know if they make any sign of moving? Yes, certainly. I wanted to offer her a word of sympathy. I don't know how I kept my face straight during my examination. Poor Holmes. He's bitten off more than he can chew, this time. Oh, you should have seen me as a broken-hearted widow. Do pardon me, Mr. Holmes. I think I'll take some fresh air. This has been so terribly upsetting. Look out! Dr. Watson, would you mind coming and speaking to Mrs. Douglas? I was about to offer my condolences to Mrs. Douglas. But they appear to be superfluous. As a matter of fact, she wants to ask you something. Yes. I feel the gravity of the situation calls for some explanation. I'm afraid you must have thought my behavior very callous, Dr. Watson. Your behavior is not my business, Mrs. Douglas. But I must admit, I find it a little difficult to reconcile with the circumstances. Uh, what did you want to ask me? If I was to tell Mr. Holmes something in confidence, would he tell the police? I can't answer that. - In other words, is Mr. - Holmes working with the police or on his own? That, I can't answer. Well, could he get rid of the police? Tell him he was satisfied and send them away? Certainly not. Mr. Holmes is an independent investigator. But I feel certain that he would withhold nothing from the officials that might help to bring the criminals to justice. If you require any further information, I refer you to Mr. Holmes. Ah. Holmes! I'm bound to admit, Holmes, I agree with you. This case isn't so simple, after all. Oh, no. On the contrary, my dear Watson. To me, it becomes clearer every minute. Well, don't worry. I Think I can put you on the right track. Uh, I should, indeed, be grateful. Now the murderers- - Oh, there's more than one? My dear Holmes, if you'll stop interrupting me, I'll explain my theory. Sorry, yes, Watson. I'm so sorry. I apologize. Oh, please don't mention it. So you have a theory? Well, it's more of a certainty than a theory. Ah, good. I'm all attention. From the first, Barker's account of the tragedy didn't satisfy me. No. No, no, I, I noticed that. I came to the conclusion he was telling lies. Half truths, Watson. Much more dangerous. He admitted that Douglas was jealous. And I suggest he had good cause to be. Oh, you think this is a crime of passion? Exactly. Oh, oh. Or as the prince so aptly put it,. The guilty lovers wanted to get rid of the husband, so they killed him. And used the story of the Scourers to put everybody off the scent. I see. Everybody except the astute Dr. Watson. Well, it hadn't occurred to you, had it? Uh, no. No, I'm bound to say that that isn't my theory. Well, I'm going to prove it to you. When I went into the garden just now, the pathetic widow was consoling herself with Barker. They were laughing. Positively laughing. That confirms it, doesn't it? Oh, yes. Yeah, that confirms it. And what's more, she wanted to ask you something in confidence. No, no, no, Watson. No, no, no. I want none of their confidences. That's always awkward when it come to an arrest. Then you agree with me? You think they're the murderers? My dear Watson, there's an appalling directness about your questions at times. Oh! Of course they did it! Why, she didn't even come into the room when she heard her husband was dead. If I'd had my head blown off, I should think it very odd if my wife didn't come and look at me. It's not so hard as you may think, Watson. You remember that I was puzzled about Douglas only using one dumb bell? - Yes. - Yes. I've found the missing one. Then everything's all right? And it's led to a discovery which has solved the whole problem. Solved? Yes, we've been listening to a tissue of lies, Watson. The whole story of the tragedy as told by Barker is a lie. And as Mrs. Douglas supports it, she must be lying, too. Now Barker swears that when he entered the room, he found Douglas lying dead with this candle burning on the table. He also says that immediately, now mark this, Watson, immediately he rang for Ames who entered the room carrying that lamp and at once blew out this candle. All within the space of two minutes. Ames corroborates this. But he also says that the candle which Douglas brought down from his bedroom, this candle, was a new one, out of the same package as these. Now what sort of a candle is it, Watson, that burns that amount in a few minutes? By Jove, Holmes! I believe you've got it! And moreover, if Barker's story were true, the assassin had less than a minute in which to remove two rings and replace one. Remember, the wedding ring was under the other one. Pin that card for the body, cross the room, and made good his escape. No, no, no, no, no, Watson. It's false, every word. Oh, that's a kindly thought, Ames. Oh, Ames, uh, can you remember what kind of shoes Mr. Barker was wearing when you found him in here after the tragedy? Yes, sir. Bedroom slippers, and a nice mess they were in. Could you conveniently lay your hands on one of those slippers? Yes, sir. Mr. Barker changed them in here for his shoes, before he went for the police. Oh, uh, would you bring them over here, Ames? Yes, yes. - Now- - Here they are, sir. Thank you, Ames. Thank you. You needn't wait. Ah, as I thought! It fits, exactly. You mean, Barker made that mark himself? It's part of this deliberate conspiracy, Watson, to hide the truth. Then why don't you arrest him? And Mrs. Douglas. My dear Watson, if you asked the good Lestrade, I think he would. No, no, no, Watson. These are only small figures in the drama. The principal players, you will meet tonight. Where? Here? And through that door, in the ruined tower of Birlstone Castle. Oh, I see. It's 46 miles to Birlstone, Moran. We are due there at midnight. Is the car ready? Yes, we shall do it comfortably. Good, now we leave the car in the Birlstone Lane, about 200 yards from the castle. You will remain with it. I will go over to the tower and fetch Balding out of his hiding place. I suppose there's no question of your finding it. He won't dare use a light you know. No question at all. I took my bearings exactly when I examined the place a week ago, made our plan and sent it to Balding. It was a stroke of genius on your part, Chief. Not at all, my dear Colonel. The one place the police would never think of looking for Balding is on the premises where Douglas was killed. Had he tried to escape, they would have caught him. As it is, we can quietly spirit him out of the way. Come, Colonel, it's time we made a start. Well, Mr. Holmes, you haven't yet told me why you brought me here. Ah, Lestrade, I wanted you to be present at the final act of this little drama. - What do you mean? - You found Balding? Can I make an arrest? No, no, no, you're too impulsive, Lestrade. Before we talk about arrests, I think we might spend a profitable 10 minutes exploring the ruined tower. You're not trying to make a fool of me, Mr. Holmes. Oh, no, no, no, certainly not, Lestrade. As my good friend Dr. Watson will tell you, there are times when I cannot resist a touch of the dramatic. So what's the idea, Mr. Holmes? Come out Mr. Douglas. Mr. Douglas? Well, what are earth are you talk... - Mr. Holmes, I believe. - Yeah. Let me introduce Mr. Douglas of Birlstone Castle. Otherwise known as Birdy Edwards. But Douglas is dead? Oh, on the contrary, my dear Lestrade. As you see, he's very much alive. But I don't understand, Mr. Holmes. Who is dead, then? Will you explain to the inspector, or shall I? Well, you've done very well, so far, Mr. Holmes. You go ahead. Well, Lestrade, uh, this is quite a simple case. It may be quite simple to you, Mr. Holmes, but how did you arrive at this solution? By means of the partially burnt out candle and the missing dumb bell. Now the candle proved that Barker had been in the room with the dead man for at least 40 minutes before he gave the alarm. And I had to ask myself, what was happening during that time? What was Barker doing? Yes, I'm afraid that's a point I missed, Mr. Holmes. Ah, well, it's not the only point you've missed, my dear Lestrade. Now Mr. Douglas was being hounded by the Scourers who had sworn to kill him. So he retreated to this castle, where he took every precaution against intruders. But Balding succeeded in entering during the day, unseen. That night, he attacked Mr. Douglas with a knife. It was knocked out of his hand, so he had to use the noisier weapon, the shotgun, which in the struggle went off, killing Balding, and mutilating him beyond recognition. Oh, I see. Well, that answers your question, Lestrade. But what about Barker? Barker, my dear Watson, on hearing the shot, came down at once. And in order to put the Scourers off the scent, they dressed Balding in Douglas' clothes. The Scourers mark on the arm completing the deception. Balding's own clothes, Barker weighted with a dumb bell and threw into the moat. Douglas then got dressed, took some food, and went into hiding. And that's what happened, Watson, while the candle was burning down. You see, Lestrade? Am I right, Mr. Douglas? I can certainly hand it to ya, Mr. Holmes. Yes. Yet, you came across one little difficulty, however. When you placed that gold nugget ring on Balding's finger, you intended to place your wedding ring there also, huh? But you, uh, you couldn't get it off, could you? No. No, I had been in a country where wedding rings slip off pretty easily, mine wouldn't. But how did you guess that Mr. Douglas was concealed here? Oh, it isn't a question of guessing, my dear Lestrade. The clue was supplied by that interesting little book on Birlstone Castle, which, uh, I, I once offered you. A clue which will amply confirm an equally interesting plan. I found in the pocket of Balding's coat. Amazing, Holmes. No, no. Simplicity itself, my dear Watson. Well, now that the case is complete, I suggest we go over to the house and discuss Mr. Douglas' position. Oh, no. You're too hasty, Lestrade. I haven't yet introduced you to the principle figure in this drama. The brains behind it all. Not your Professor Moriarty, surely. - Moriarty? - Well, who's he? My friend, Dr. Watson will tell you later. Come, gentlemen, we must lose no time. Keep her running, Moran. I'll bring Balding back in five minutes. - Look here, Mr. - Holmes, you can't expect me to believe in this Moriarty theory of yours. Moriarty is no theory, Lestrade. That's a very great thanks. Oh, well, we owe you a good deal. I suppose I must humor you. The catching of Moriarty will be the triumph of Sherlock Holmes. Quite apart from you losing your hat, Lestrade. Balding? Balding! Balding failed to carry out your instructions, Professor. Oh, you're in this are you, Holmes? Well, I warned you! You're under arrest, Moriarty. On what charge? The attempted murder of Mr. Douglas, here. Our paths have crossed for the last time, Moriarty. Put the handcuffs on him, Lestrade. Look out! Curse you, Holmes! - Good heaven's, Holmes. - It's a long drop. Yes. Yes, it's rather more than that required by law, I fancy, my dear Watson. But, uh, equally effective.
