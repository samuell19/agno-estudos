It is now 22 years since I was on my way to the Flint Farm for the first time. I distinctly remember it was a scorching hot summer day. Maybe that's why the road fell me so long. Or was it a premonition of the fateful events, - - that was the result of the decision I had made. It's weird to think, - - that if I had stopped and turned around, - - then life had taken a completely different shape. Jesper! Jesper! What a speed you have on. Hello, Mikkel. I did not see you at all. I realized. We can then follow along. I guess you're on your way to us. No, it's not. Well... No... Hey, wait for me! - How's Grete? - My wife? She's damn well. She's married to me. - Where are you going? - I'm moving on. Then you should probably go out to the Flint Farm. Yes, I'm going to. See, Jesper... Can we sit down a little? I would like to talk to you. It is said that you want to marry Else at the Flint Farm. Well, do you say that? I've known you since you were a boy. I'm warning you. - It's no use, Mikkel. - No, now you must hear the truth. You do it in spite of it because Anna took the parish priest's son instead of you. So? She should have a farm owner, not a poor guy like me. Where is your good mood though? I do not know you at all. Have you thought about what it means to marry a poor girl like Else? To put it nicely, she's not quite up here. Yes, I have thought about it. And she's good enough for me. - I'm going out there now. - The Flint Farm is a damn place! - It is the area's largest farm. - It's still an accursed place. - If you move out there, you're done. - On the contrary. I have many plans. - Goodbye, Mikkel. - Then you do not know Kresten Flint! I do not believe the stories that are told about him. It has never been proven that he pushed his brother off the cliff. It was he who benefited from his death. Then he was alone on the farm. Why did he become so shy and malicious since that day? No, turn around, Jesper. I know you mean well to me, but I've made my decision. Hello, Mads. Hello, Mikkel. Well, is that you? - It was Jesper. - Think, could you see that too? It's sad. That with Jesper. He walks right into the forecourt of hell, - - just because his girlfriend has married someone else. You probably know the message of everything. You have to follow what is happening. - Do not want to sit down? - Yes, thank you, but I'm sitting. You finally have to take root in the seat. "Hell's forecourt," you say. If it so bad, why do you stay at the Flint Farm? I can resign whenever I want. Jesper cannot if he marries Else. It will be pure misery, I predict. You've always been an unlucky bird. I do not want you sitting on my bench! You don't want to hear the truth! That marriage is going to hell. Then scrub off with you! Yes, I have to go up to the farm and see how it goes. Otherwise, I came to hear how your daughter, Marie, is doing. Did you? I have to grieve you that she's doing exceptionally well. Her lordship is extremely pleased, and she is not with child or anything, - - so our Marie, do not put your dirty fingers on! - Hoof, hoof, small blows. - Small blows? I promise you it's going to be big blows if you do not disappear from my garden! - And it must be now! - I'm leaving. And stay away! How are you talking to Mads Fynbo, though? "Mads town-gossip" you mean? I speak exactly as he deserves. Why do we keep Amtstidende? He tells everything that happens. - Do not get upset now. - I'm excited as it suits me! He claims it will be pure misfortune if Jesper proposes to Else. - You mean that yourself. - Yes, well I do. He's just not going to come here and think the same thing, that stupid pig. Couldn't you have gotten Jesper out of it? No, unfortunately. I tried, but he is young and stubborn. Aunt Jane, come on. You must see him. - I saw him inside Sandbjerg. - Yes, but you must see him again. Later, child. Now walk away from that window. - We go down and receive him. - Your father needs to talk to him first. - Who was he in love with? - It was the seamstress who told it. Yes, seamstresses. - Do you think he likes my dress? - Yes sure. What are they talking about, him and Dad? They are probably talking about the future. What are you doing? I loosen my hair. I have beautiful hair. Flaming red hair. Here you go. It probably won't be long before he arrives. Come here! Such a carnivore! Down! Well, it's you who's named Jesper Poulsen? Yes. - You probably dared to venture out here? - What should I be afraid of? No, really. Sit down and let's get to the point. - I better tell about myself. - No need. Orphaned. Have been out earning since you were twelve years old. Going to be a good hand. Have only a few hundred crowns in the bank. - Is there anything else? - No. And now you've got the idea of ​​wanting to marry my daughter. Why? - Because she loves me. - But what about you? This is probably the farm you're after. But it's mine until I die. As long as that, it's me who decides. - I'm well aware of that. - Then we say that. It's a good deal you make, - - even though Else is... Yes, you know what she's like. But I love that lass and have always given her what she pointed to. And now she's pointing at you. - I'll be good to her. - I would advise you to do that. Else precedes everything else. Remember it. Nothing with other women. We keep to ourselves here on the farm. Can you find yourself in that? Otherwise you can walk away. I've made my decision. I will stay. Good. Now. You have to kiss me. You have to kiss me now. I would like to welcome you good neighbors, - - who has come to celebrate Else's wedding. We are not very many and we have received a lot of cancellations. But we who are here should not lack anything. Here is food, drink and music. I hope we have a happy evening. Why are the Sandbjerg people not here? Jesper was there for three years and they are good friends. Jesper asked to have them with him, but Kresten objected. - There was unfriendliness about the dam. - Yes, he's stubborn, Kresten. It's a lot that Jesper got Grete and me with him. - Yes, but he demanded it. - No, did he? - Come on, we're going to dance. - Else, sit down. - No, we have to dance now. - We have just started eating. No, it has to be now! Now! - Come on, we're going to dance. - Then dance with her when she wants it! The bridal waltz! You are mine. You're my husband, aren't you? Yes, Else. - Do you think I'm pretty? - Yes, you're pretty. Was she also pretty, her Anna, you knew before me? - So, Else. - Answer me. was she pretty? Reply! Yes, she was pretty. No, she's ugly! She's ugly! Do you hear? She's ugly! She's ugly! She's ugly! - Do you hear? She's ugly! Ugly! - Get together now, Else. So, little child, calm down now. Be sensible now, little girl. Come on, Else. Then, the daily work began. There was enough to tackle. Kresten Flint was an old, stubborn man and had left much to be desired. But the lands were good and the farm beautiful. Worth another comb worth. Mogens! Here, grab it. - Hello, Jesper. - Hello, Anna. - What do you owe the honor? - I promised to pick up my husband. Hans is at a meeting at the Flint Farm. - I did not know there was a meeting. - Doesn't? It's about the dam. - I see. - How are you feeling? - Well. How are you feeling? Also good. Jesper, do not hate me too much. I kind of regret what I did. It is too late now. Yes. Anna, you better drive. They can see us from the yard, and maybe the meeting is over soon. Yes. So goodbye then. So come to your senses, man! The salt water stands in over large stretches that were previously fertile. - It's ruining our property. - I do not want to see your drawing. No dam will be made on my land. The soil is so miserable that it only serves for grazing sheep. You have a certain obligation. Let's talk calmly about the cases, otherwise we will get nowhere. It's pointless. He's neither to chop nor poke at, Hans. Yes, but I have a suggestion. You could sell me the land down by the old lock and your beach grounds. You say yourself, the land is worthless. So why buy it? I wanted to repair the lock and build a dam. It sounds good. What do you say, Kresten? - I say no. - It's just stubbornness. Shouldn't your son-in-law be consulted? - He has nothing to say. - He will inherit the farm. So talk to him for that time, but it may take a long time. - We're getting old in my family. - Shall we not say "some of you"? I mean, your twin brother didn't get very old then. - It was something else. - Yes, it was an accident. We have no more talking to each other to do. May I offer a cup of coffee? No thanks. I think we're leaving now. - Goodbye, Jane. - Goodbye. Goodbye, Jane. You can think about my suggestion. - Goodbye, Jane. - Goodbye, Hans. - So you wanted to offer coffee? - That's part of it. Not on my farm! And not at all when someone wants to dictate something to me. Do you know who they would advise? My son-in-law. I like Jesper. He came here with the best of intentions. - He came out here as a fortune hunter. - Perhaps. But I do not give much for the happiness he has received. - Else... - Not a word about Else! Yes! She has become completely unreasonable after giving expecting a child. - And Jesper is so patient with her. - Go then, Jane. Yes, Kresten. Then it was autumn. I began to feel at ease among the strange people at the Flint Farm. The relationship with Else was not the worst. Only when an insane jealousy occupied her sick mind, - - life on the farm was unbearable. But when winter came, Else demanded that I be around her all the time. She was gentler than usual and I wanted to be kind to her. Hey, Grete. Hello, Jesper. It's been a long time since we've seen anything for you. - Do you have Mikkel at home? - No, he's out fishing. - Did you want something special for him? - No, not really. - Maybe you just needed to talk? - Yes, I did. Is there anything new with Else? Not yet. The doctor says it will happen tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. You have to see, it's probably going well. Bring these flowers home for her. - Thank you, Grete. - It has not been easy. But it may be that it helps when she has the baby. Yes, I hope so too. As long as it now becomes a healthy child. I do not think I could stand it if... It's bad enough with Else. - I have to go home. I have no peace. - Let us know when something happens. Yes, I will. Greet Mikkel. That evening I had to call the doctor and the midwife. And as the hours went by, I became more and more restless. Jesper! - How is it going? - Come up. Do not strain me on the torture bench. I waited for hours and heard the doctor drive. Jane, is that a healthy baby? These are two small healthy lads. Two? I dare not even touch them. Yes, now you have to give the little creatures all your love. It's probably best as it's gone. What do you mean? - Is it something with Else? - Yes, Jesper. She's gone from us. Else? Yes, she's got peace now. She had a seizure just as the boys were born. That's why I've put the cradle out here. It was a shame. - Does Kresten know that? - Yes. - How did he take it? - He did not say a word. He just walked. - Can I go in there? - Yes. Jesper! Jesper! - You look scared. Is there something wrong? - I'm afraid so. - Is it something with Kresten? - I saw him down by the beach. He stood on the high slope and looked completely wild. He shouted and screamed. - What was he shouting? - Something about revenge and retaliation. I did not dare to stay, so I ran home. That was good, Thomas. Run over and pick up the others. Say they have to bring lights. There is he laying! He does not move. We're going down there. Came. - It was now a wonderful funeral. - Yes, I guess so. Now no one sees us. Now you can close the tap. You have no heart in life. I have so much heart I can see it was the best thing that could happen. Jesper looked so sad in the church. He was completely pale. He must have frozen just like the rest of us. Listen, Grete, you do not have a pour, do you? No. And not at all now that we are coming from such a sad solemnity. Our Lord probably knows what he is doing. Now Jesper has a big farm and two lovely boys that aunt Jane takes care of. What did Marie write? I saw there was letter from her. - It was nothing special. - Do I have to see it? I do not know where I put it. But as I said, there was nothing new. Now I have to pick up the drink you want. What? If you get goodwilllingly the snaps, there must be something wrong. As a man in the house, I demand to read our daughter's letter! - Mikkel, let me explain now - I'll probably read it myself. Oh like that. Marie has thus had an accident. Yes, that is, she is engaged. With the past third mate. - He's just on a long voyage. - Yes, it's good, yes. - There are ink stains all over it. - She must have cried, poor child. And we have given her a good and Christian upbringing. It's you she's got it from. Yes, I have never given birth prematurely. What? No That you can call it. - Maybe I have? - No, because I had character strength. - Now! - What? Well, back then... She asks if she can come home. - Yes, and I think so. - No, I do not want to see her here! You can go to the bank and withdraw 50 crowns to her. - You do not get a lot of children for that. - That's child enough for me. - Mikkel, she's our only one. - We should be grateful for that. How will he rejoice, him Mads gossip. - Then come with that drink! - Yes, little Mikkel. She can flinch and go. Hello, Jesper. Well, you're messing with the dam. Yes, it's going well. The lock is in order now. You notice that a new man has arrived at the Flint Farm. - Kresten was something old-fashioned. - Yes, and stubborn. - It's a good farm you have inherited. - I do not complain. How are the sons? Do they thrive? Yes, thanks to Aunt Jane. Here is the farm. The lock. And here comes the dam. It is these areas that are at stake. - And are you absolutely sure? - Yes, there is no doubt. - What's up, Anna? - It was just that coffee. Put it on the table, we can do it ourselves. (There is muffled talk behind the door) (It knocks on the window) - I have to talk with you. - Come on in. No one should know I'm here. - What can I do for you? - It is inverted. I'm coming to help you. Warn you. Warn me. Against whom? Against Hans. He will hurt you. He's jealous of you. But why? For that with the two of us. I know it was him I married, - - but he can see that I'm not happy. Anna. That was not what we were going to talk about. They will fool the yard from you. Fool it from me? Who? Your lawyer and Hans and another man I do not know. - What are you talking about? - There was a meeting at our house today. They talked about Kresten and that you had accepted inheritance and debt. The estate has not been settled yet. Such a thing can last a long time. Yes, exactly. They will drag out the time. I do not understand a word. Do not you think you are wrong? No. Kresten was not so rich at all. He had lost money for some reason. Hans has bought up claims on him. I have not heard that. The lawyer said I could just pull on him. That's just it. They said they would let you run the line out. Put yourself in as big an expense as possible and then strike. No, it cannot fit. If that was not true, then do you think I was here? No, you are right. I have to go now. What do you want to do? I do not know. I do not know. Goodbye, Jesper. Goodbye, Anna. And thanks. Now it all went so well. Fate fixed it, and then you give up. It is impossible to get along with Hans. But from there and then to give up? It does not look like you at all, Jesper. What is the use? It's all worth no more than this stone. Stone? - Jesper... - What's up? It's flint. A straight ball of flint. By digging here we have encountered a flint bearing. - What does it mean? - That the ground here is worth its weight in gold! - Do you think so? - I know. There is only flint here in Denmark. It is exported to all over the world. Sometimes you have to go 10-20 meters into the ground after that. They once knew that. That is why the farm is called the Flint Farm, you cod. - Hey, hey! - It's my damn self, I scold. Do you think Hans knew anything about it? That, of course, is why he is so eager to get the farm. Look happy, Jesper. You will become a wealthy man. That's fine, but how do we approach it? Trust me, I know how. Tomorrow we will talk to the bank manager. He can probably help us. So, so. Your little kitty, yes. Grete, I'm here. Hello, little Mikkel. How was the bank? Yes, they were very interested. Jesper was glad I was there. Even if you are just a homemaker, so (Baby chatter) (Baby chatter) What is that? It's a little girl. It's Marie's. I'm probably aware you did not win her in the lottery. - Her name is Karen. - I do not care. What is she doing here? Marie wondered if we could have her for a while. - It would help her so much. - No, I say like the lord of the house. Should we have one to bread? Never, not to mention. Such a person eats almost nothing. Soon it eats us out of the house. And it's me who's going to raise money. - Where's Marie? - She did not dare to meet you, so she left. Please pack it together. When Jesper arrives in a little while, he can drive you to the station. - Yes, when you look at it that way. - I do. That is for sure. It could just fit. Then it has to have clothes, and then it has to go to school. Then it must be confirmed. It probably ends with engagement and wedding. No thank you, Mr. Teacher, not for my hard-earned pennies. What are you laughing at? Oh, my God, such a bad shit. No, I will not. It does not work. I told my wife that. What is it now? You must not let yourself toot. Should Grandpa play a little for you? Yes, I have to. Hear, where the lark beats his wheelbarrow for the golden sun I for you will also play a little on my violin you are my eye stone a teensy lovely one is you and when the two of us go together then I am always happy as now you are a piece of the blue of the sky You will get the happiness of the world who then comes on the green branch so do my eyegem and me a thousand bellflowers sway gently in the glow of the sun listen, I've seen the lark sing along to this one you are my eye stone a teensy lovely one is you and when the two of us go together then I am always happy as now you are a piece of the blue of the sky You will get the happiness of the world who then comes on the green branch so do my eyegem and me - Now I am ready. - Shhhh! What are you going to do with that rug? - It's for the baby. - Karen is warm enough, as she does. - It's rather for the drive. - No trip should be run here. We must not keep her. There are large expenses for a child. Nonsense and nonsense. Such a teensy tiny one does not eat the whole world. - She will not always be small. - You're just cooking for one more. She also needs to have clothes and such. Expenses you go and lament over. - I never moan! - Yes you do. The child stays here. I'll show you who's the man in the house! - Hey, Grete. - Come and see my little grandson. - Is it Marie? - Yes, and ours. If otherwise her raven grandmother will keep her. Yes, then you get your will. You always get that. That's how they should be, women. Now look right at her. I think she looks like me. Especially when she's asleep. Yes, now you say it yourself. Now we both have something to work for. We have that. Then followed some happy years. There was more flint than we knew. Enough to save the farm. My boys were named Viggo and Martin and were as different as day and night. Viggo was bright and happy, - - while Martin was more serious and had inherited his mother's red hair. Come here, Martin. - You're not mad, are you? - No. (The door closes) - There we have the little Flint sons. - Sneak out and play. I need to talk to Mikkel. Dad, can we have to go down to the beach? Yes, get away with it. But beware of the slope. - Do you want a drink, Mikkel? - Yes, I would like that. - Grandpa? - Yes, my little eye stone? - Where did the boys go? - Down to the beach. May I go there too? May I? Well, yes, yes, then. Sweet gal. It's otherwise a little early, she's starting to run after men. The years went by. The boys grew big - - and became more and more inseparable. Martin's temper frightened me. I walked in a constant anxiety that he had inherited his mother's sick mind. Now you just have to see. One, two, three. Give it a try. - Stretch your arms. - That's also what I'm trying to do. Such a filth! Stop it. - Hey. - Hey, Karen. - Do you go down and pick nuts? - Yes, that was a good idea. - Aren't you coming, Martin? - No. Just let him be. You know there is nothing about it when you are not with. Come on. The business grew. We now picked up the flint from the depths of the earth with machine power, - - and Mikkel's words came true: I became a wealthy man. I lived a happy life with my boys, - - which were now so big that I felt like a friend with them. We were avid hunters, - - and even though I shot better than them, they forgave me. They still considered me an older man, - - despite the fact that at 45 I still felt young. Down. Go! Apport, boy! Then take it! Aunt Jane still managed the house with a knowledgeable hand. Mikkel and his wife had grown old and gray, - - and little Karen had become a sweet young girl. On May 14, we gathered for the twins' birthday. Let's then greet each other - - and congratulate the boys on the 38 years. - 38, Jesper? They're only 19. - Yes, but there are two of them. Well, you take them in bundles? Bravo, bravo, bravissimo! And shame on the one who does not want to drink the twins' bowl Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Congratulations, Viggo. Congratulations, Martin. And this bowl we drink he might want to give another round You must be a Marine soldier, Martin. - When are you going in? - In three weeks. You should have done as I did: Smoked three cigars before the session. - Then you too had been discarded. - I want to go out and look around. You will not be sent to Greenland immediately. Many will only sail between the hen bridge and Northern Costum. That's how it went with me. And since then I have been sailing my own lake. - A little more apple pie? - No, I can 't damn well anymore. - You have also eaten three servings. Viggo, stick one on the box. - Gladly. - You do not dare. Is there no one who wants more? Shouldn't we say welcome? Then we drink out. Cheers. Thanks for food. You do not know what Jane and I have agreed. What have you two girls brewed together? Do you want to go to the market? Oh, your rubbish head. Well, we've decided Karen's going up here and teaching housekeeping. It's great. No one asks if I mind. - Do you have it then? - No, I really do not have. I said that to myself. - It's a lot of fun. - We can not run away now. Something so rare happens here. Let's ask Dad. - We can not be that familiar. - Yes, we can. Dad... Listen to this. So there is a market inside Sandbjerg. And then you want to borrow the jeep and disappear? - Can we? - Yes, get rid of you. - We're taking Karen with us. - Mikkel probably does not want that. Yeah that sounds pretty good to me, you all go on. Do you have any money with you? - No. - Yes, I have plenty. Martin, you never learn it. - Do not drive too fast, Viggo. - No, Aunt Jane, we are slowly leaving, Wait for me! Wait, Jacob! We need it. Do you want to join the market? - No, I'd rather save my money. - Maybe you should get married? No, I'm saving up for a farm. We are not all born equally lucky. It was enough for us, huh? (The bell rings) (The bell rings) Fine gingerbread! Fine gingerbread! We must have a heart. It has to be that. Here you go, here you have my heart. - "Sweet girl." - Yes, it's you. A daler. Spot, spot! Be careful now. Yes! Three in the spot! - Shall we have the whole box? - No, but you have to choose. - I'm taking the cake spoon. - It's for your equipment. When we rock to the beat of the music, yes, time flies away now put grace and splendor in the plastic it is our favorite sport What a laugh and the blink and the look and your gaze has a radiant shine when we rock in time to the music, the life is like a dance Need a bite? Hey, Vera. - Shall we two take a swing? - No, thank you. - Come on, Vera. Karl, leave me alone! Let me go, I say! Do not! Then release her! Mind your own business. - Thank you, Martin. That was nice of you. - It's alright. Each time the moon's yellow lantern lured 'with its glow I my dear girl searched here among the trees of the forest you are my eye stone a teensy lovely one is you and when the two of us go together then I am always happy as now you are a piece of the blue of the sky all the happiness you will get who then comes on the green branch so do my eyegem and I. - Then it's my turn. - Of course, you old man. Hey, Vera. Are you alone to market today? Do not have your girlfriend with you? He stands there drinking beer. He's not my boyfriend anymore. - Did you give him the ring back? - Yes, last week. He drinks too much. Have you seen Vera? Now she wants to dance damn well. Hold that. - Then keep your fingers off my girlfriend! - Take it easy, you've been drinking. "Take it easy." Have you heard him the angel child? He can swing with that mocha, but he does not like to fight! I have no qualms about fighting and I'll gladly give you a slap! (Overwhelmed girl screams) (Laughter) (Overwhelmed girl screams) Viggo! - Martin, so help him though! - It is not necessary, he can himself. Practice, three against one. What's going on, Hans? - The Flint sons make fights. - It's not certain they started. Does not? One can otherwise trust them all with the father they have. You are not allowed to say that. Jesper is well kept. - Yes, now that he has money. - That's not why. This is how he has always been, and he has not changed. No, you must know that. I have not spoken to him for years. You have taken care of that. Now look at the redhead. I think I'm going home. (Laughter) Let's see to get away. I'm so mad at you, Viggo. It was all your fault. - Of course, it always is. - Yes, it is. Look Martin, he's so stable. Well I'm not. It's fun with a little quick fight. No, it is not. And now that your father has become a member of the parish council. - Can't you leave those girls alone? - No, it's hard. This time it was Vera. - She's also a pretty one. - Yes she is. Very pretty, even. I do not want to talk to you at all. Just you looked a little more like Martin. Should I dye my hair red? Your beast! Do not always stick with him, Martin. (Humming happily) - It smells good here. Do you give a cup? - It can probably happen. Sit down. You could be a really nice little farmer's wife. If a nice guy proposed to you. One who saved together for a farm. - What would you say then? - That he should get the farm first. - Here you go. - Thanks. - Is the basket finished? - Not yet. The coffee should be straight on thermoses. - Where's Karen? - She's out by the chickens. Here I am- Karen, go over to the boys with this. The vanilla wreaths are for Martin. We must be a little good to him, now that he's going in as a soldier. He'll probably get them. - Here you go. - Thanks. - Go to Viggo first. - I'll do that. Coffee's ready. Thank you. Who in the Bible was watering the camels? It was Rachel, but today it's me, Grandpa. Heck for girl child. Thank you. - Who should have nothing? - I come now. Take it easy. - What is that? - Vanilla wreaths for Martin. Faster Jane's the best. I chop a few pieces. - They taste great. - Your beast. I'm taking one too. - We're some thieves. - Martin had done the same. - No, I do not think he had. - indeed he had so. Well, I have to move on. Here you go. You should always tease. I do not like you at all. Well you can then. Greet the stoner! (Car honks) I was just standing there thinking of something I would suggest to you. All those rocks there smoke down again after we peeled the flint off. - They're not worth anything either. - No, and I think that's wrong. They must be able to be crushed and used for road paving. It does not sound so crazy at all. I have to think about that. That's probably a bigger story. Maybe it does not pay off. Now we'll see. I would like to send you abroad. Then you could learn something more. Could you really, Dad? It interests you more than agriculture. We should talk about that. Whoops! - What a speed you have on. - Let me just set the basket. Puh... Well, you have to have your coffee. No, do not do that. I have something I want to tell you. Come on, let's go to a place where there is not so much spectacle. You look serious. So am I. - When I'm going to the Navy now - I'll miss you. - Will you, Karen? - Yes, of course. Come, sit down. What's wrong with you? You look so solemn. Yes, Karen. We have known each other all our lives. We played together and had a great time. And I have loved you as a sister, - - but I do not do that anymore. - I love you, Karen. - Martin. - Do you think you could like me? - Yes, but I do. I would be so happy if you would wait for me. Very happy. - Will you? - Yes. - It's warm! Has Martin come home? - Yes, he's in with his father. Viggo, I had just laid the pieces so nicely. It was a shame. I take another piece, then it can not be seen. - He's probably naughty. - I can never get mad at him now. - Dad? - Come in, Viggo. Listen, do you go fishing? You all look so solemn. - Karen and Martin are engaged. - It was damned. I think they are too young, but they do not think they are. What to say to that? - You can say congratulations. - Yes, you silly. I could do that too. - Congratulations to you. - Thank you, Viggo. Congratulations, Martin. So you are engaged? - Do you not usually kiss the bride? - I'll probably take care of that. Of course, you old. - Did you tell Aunt Jane? - Not yet. She is then one of the first who should know that. Out with you. Yes, it also came as a surprise to me. But then we bachelors have to stick together. That is strange. I thought I knew Martin. I had no idea he was in love. No, but when they now love each other, the two of us can not interfere in it. - Right? - No. And Karen is a sweet girl. I just think they should have waited until he finished the Navy. It was nice of Martin to send us this picture. Yes, he's a good boy. And the uniform suits him. So I think now, - - that I was nicer when I was in the Navy. Yes, indeed. - Why indeed? - You were not so tall. - Was not I tall? - Yes, in the hat. - In the hat? - Go in and take a nap. Our Lord is preserved, what a chatter. So, women. And then she's even one of the best. - Mikkel? - No! I have something to tell you. Then come in and close the joint. It pulls on the cows. The joint? Oh... It was a lot of fun. (Mads laughs out loud) It was not that fun either. - I have news. - You also look so happy. Then it's probably something with illness, bankruptcy or foot-and-mouth disease. Hans from the Rice Farm died this morning. - Oh my God. Of what? - It was the heart. Too high blood pressure. Then he has peace. Yes, and the wife. She has not had it easy, little Anna. But now Jesper can get her. It was said in its time. They said, yes. You're probably the worst gossip handle in miles around. By the way, I have received a letter from Martin. And picture. - Yes, Jens Post told it. - Well, did he? Yes, he also said that Martin is diligent in writing to Karen. Well, did he say that? Yes, you have to hope it lasts. Out of sight, out of mind. Then scrub off with you! Then disappear! Yes, yes, now I'm going. Sleep well. Oh, shut up! - Are you leaving, Mads? - Yes, Mikkel has thrown me out. - Yes, he really has. Goodbye. - Goodbye, Mads. - What has he done now? - What has he done? He's ruined a man's dinner sleep. It's sacrilege, it is. Oops! Snooze sleeper! No, listen now. I must... Karen! So, there I got you! No, Viggo, we must not. No, you are right. We should never have done that. It must not happen again. Viggo? - It's your father. - Yes. Came. Go around behind, he must not see you. Viggo? Yes, father? Go over and put a saddle on Ronny. Just come on, Karen. I have seen you. Come over here. Then get rid of you. Jesper, are you coming to visit me? Yes, that was my intention. It was unfortunate. I'm going to a meeting in town. There is so much to fix. Yes, of course. Is there anything I can help with, you know where I live. Thank you, Jesper. Are you not coming over another day? Yes, thank you, if I can. I will be happy if you come. See you, Anna. Here you go. Well, do you have it too? And hearts lady! You can't beat it. Then I won again. We're just taking another game. - No, Grandpa, I'd rather go home. - Do you not like playing cards now? Yes, but I'm tired. You're mad. You've been so quiet all night. She probably has something to wonder about. Not at that age. She only gets that when she becomes a grandfather. Yes, you understand what I mean. Good night, Grandpa. - Good night, little Karen. Well, now let's look at this. Six up and five in small added together with the four... Three times seven is twenty-one, divided by eighteen. Yes, I did earn 38 ears anyway. You should have followed her up the yard. It's so dark. There is no one running with her. She knows the way. Is that you, Viggo? You scared me completely. I've been waiting for you for a whole hour. It was Grandpa who definitely wanted to play cards. But you had promised me not to come. I know, but I could not help it. - You were expecting me too, weren't you? - Yes. - What are we going to do? - I do not know. We cannot help it we love each other, can we? Well, I guess we can not. Karen... - Am I interrupting, Jesper? - No, just come in. There's something I need to talk to you about. I almost think I know what it is. Have you noticed that too? Little Jane, I know my boys. Don't you think I can see Viggo feeling really miserable? I'm so worried. What should we do? Nothing at all. If he is in love and at the same time has a bad conscience, - - then we can not help him. Yes, but he has completely lost his mood, and so has she. Now let's look at the time. I myself have experienced that what one could not get was the only blissful thing. - And I'm still alive, Jane. - Yes, but... - Shouldn't I talk to Viggo? - I do not think it helps. Young people in love do only what they want. But now let's see when Martin gets leave. Maybe everything will sort itself out. "This letter will hurt you." No... - By the way, where's Viggo? - He must have gone for a walk. - Should not I put music on? - Yes, you do. Program 2. Did you get it written? I can't. I've tried, - - but it looks so hard when it's on paper. I'll talk to him when he comes next week. No, he must know that before he comes. Oh, Viggo, he's so fond of his letters. He trusts me like that. We have to say that. We have to talk to him, right? - I'm writing to him tomorrow. - It's so awful all together. Come on, we'll go down to the garden. They can see us up from the farm. Now afterwards I cannot understand, I said yes to Martin. I liked you both. I've never thought of you that way. But then he stood there and looked at me so seriously and lovingly. Martin will understand that when we explain it to him. - Do you think so? - Yes, he will. Martin, I could have driven you all the way up to the farm. No thanks. I'd rather go the last piece. The family is not expecting me. - No, then they would have picked you up. - I exchanged leave with a friend. - Then there are some who get happy. - You can count on it. Thanks for the ride. Greetings at home, Martin. Martin? Martin! Martin! What has happened? Oh no, why is Martin lying there? What has happened, though? Martin is sick, Jane. - Go in and call the doctor. - Oh my God... Hurry up, Jane. Come on, Viggo. We're carrying your brother up. - How is it? - What does the doctor say? It's a severe concussion. The poor man speaks in delusion. - Then I guess I should not go in there. - No. Your father is sitting with him. I do not think it's good he sees you, Viggo. It's all my fault! Yes, yes, my boy. I'm afraid it's going to be a long sickbed. Come on, little Karen. Poor Martin. But he's better off, you say? Yes, thank God. It's been some bad weeks. I understand that so well. The doctor says he just needs to get away from it all for a while. I think that would be wise too. The crazy thing is that Viggo wants to go too and Karen wants to leave. What should I do with them? It's hard to advise. - Did the boys talk to each other? - Not yet. It will have to wait until Martin himself wants to see Viggo. - It's not easy being young. - No. You should advise Viggo and Karen to stick together if they love each other. Yes, it is better for one to be unhappy than for three. We can talk about that. Yes, Anna, you're right. I think Martin's over it, - as long as he is allowed to work with everything that interests him. I'm sorry I'm bothering you with all my worries. I would love to help you if I can. You can. As you stand there, you look like yourself when you were 18 years old. Yes, but I'm not 18 years old. Unfortunately, that's a long time ago. But life is not over yet. Right? Jesper... Now there is enough, Rikke. Can you peel these potatoes in a hurry. Aunt Jane, you need a big kiss. - Why? - Because I'm so happy today. I understand that so well. Can you look for the chickens that they are not burning on? - Left or right? - Your feather head. - Go aside or I'll kiss you. - Oh, our Lord preserve me well! (Rikke and Karen laugh) - Here you are probably in a good mood. - Yes, it's a big day today. So it's true what Mads gossip said. That Martin has recovered and was out walking for the first time. And that he travels abroad when he finishes as a soldier. Yes, it all fits. Move, and let an old man sit down. I get so moved. - You do not have a drink, do you? - Yes. - You can get two if you want. - Just put them in the same glass. Thanks. You are my eye stone, a teensy lovely one are you - Have the brothers talked together? - No, but I've talked to Martin. He's gone out to Viggo and I'm not scared. Me neither. Cheers. Whoa! It went in the crazy throat. I need another one. Subtitles by Essery.
