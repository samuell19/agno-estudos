All similarities with reality are not mere coincidences. Ambassador, Not even blacks Not even blacks Not even blacks, says the president Viva! We do the jobs that even black people do not want to do.

Lucy, send me the story when you finish it. - That sounds like something! - Yes. It lacks Mazacote money. I was very clear about the deal ... The guy in costume is the governor Carmelo Vargas, and the other? With these clothes, surely a narco. But in fact I'm shaking it. It could be an impresario, a union leader, what you want. And now, what? You know what happened in the palace with the ambassador? Yes, I read it on the Internet, and it's clear that Mexicans are more brooms than the Negroes in everything. The good news is that there was no that the official media, and only the staff has makes the recording. But the rumor is out on social networks, and the President, who worries about his popularity, would like us to inflate this thing for the scandal goes unnoticed. But the president and Governor Vargas are of the same party, why is it falling on him? By pure bad luck. According to the secretariat of the government, it's the best thing they have in their hands. So we leave for a new Chinese box operation. Exactly. It is clear that this jerk of president is very weak, but OK, We must manage the consequences. Arrange for it to appear the best possible, put a little more punch. You have carte blanche, but I want it in main information. - Yes, Mr. - Carlitos, Good...

But I promise you that the next Once we will give you the rest. Wise guy, you always try the devil, but I swear to you that if you do not bring not the money next time, I send my guys to cut your balls. And it's not a metaphor! First of all, I apologize for the vulgarity of the language used. But sometimes it's not the words but the facts that offend us the most. Note cynicism and shamelessness the governor, his face that lights up when he discovers the contents of the bag. And the way obscene and without shameless with which he takes and caresses them bundles of banknotes. You understand better now what is it? Please... Pay special attention to the details and judge for yourself. Listen old, I'm going to open an account in my niece's name, and on it you will put the rest. No problem. Yes Liciensado is for you. Yes. What's going on Ivana? Is he or one of his employees? Ask him to wait, we will put it on the air. It's Carlito, go ahead. Javier, the governor is online, he is with you after the video. What pressure do you want me to put on him? Enough for him be done on it, please OK. Do you have the call? I'm informed right now that we have the governor online. Governor, good evening. Thank you for your call. Good evening, Javier, and thank you for the opportunity to be able to clarify this situation lamentable to your audience. Governor, with all due respect, does not it seem to you ashamed to show you that way and leave us doubts about your behavior which I do not know if it is illegal but that seems undoubtedly immoral. Well, I would first like to clarify that he is not so clear ... that I am the person appearing on the video. And second, I do not know the source of this video. It is not difficult to imagine that my enemies use your prestigious media to launch a campaign misinformation ... Sorry for the interruption governor but what are you saying there seems very serious to me. Frankly, I think that we can doubt whether it is you on this video, but it is certain that we recognize clearly your voice and this language, so flowery which characterizes you. No, no, no, Javier I do not doubt you and I apologize, but you know better than me with these new technologies, we can easily ... - Mr. Governor again with all due respect, and without insulting intelligence of our dear spectators, please do not use an easy excuse to try to justify you. Here, more than cynicism what we hope, it's an explanation, and a clear reason to these shameful facts. And for that, and as always, our microphones are open to you. - Good evening. - Good evening, and thank you for the opportunity ... - How many times have I told you? No matter the color, or the party, all are equal. And that's why we invite you to participate to the question of the day. "Do you think the governor Vargas should resign? " Call us to participate. What a gang of sons of whores! They think they are the kings of the country. But it's clear, if these assholes hold their puppet in Los Pinos, they think they can play to cons with me. So stupid, How are we going to do this, to get out of this shit, by the big door? Liciensado, with all due respect, I keep thinking that all this is a conspiracy. You really are an Oscar genius. Even my late wife, who was more stupid than you, would not want to swallow that shit. And you, what do you propose, Poncho? I think liciensado, that we must accept to have took a beating. I spoke with a friend from the station, they have other videos to finish the week. I do not think our government will not bear another scandal of this importance. Fucking shit! And all because of the assholes who fucked those fucking cameras. They disconnected the system and tomorrow they remove liciensado. The brothel is that here we have treaties. And when we know who dropped this video I'll cut his balls. Well, what do we do? I think you should get closer to the television to do an interview. You want me to eat a plate of shit? Do not be stupid, Poncho! I would not like do comparison, but remember what arrived with your colleagues, the twisted and Gover who did not negotiate on time with the television. They just wanted fuck my dear Gover because he liked pretty girls. Bad news, godfather, the opposition is after you. Corrupted! Assassin! Look like the People repudiate you! Corrupted, you will pay for all the injustices! Thief! Thief! Assassin! He's still here, that fucking messiah with always his same gueulantes. Outside ! Good, no matter we are going to swallow the shit of TV. Prepare my plane, we take off tomorrow at the first hour. Ha, and also ... that the jerk of finance prepare me 3 million ... in case. And before the call back, we give you the results of our telephone survey at the question : "Do you think the governor Vargas should resign? " Quit immediately, 91%. Do not resign, 6%. I did not tell you Carlitos, They all relegated the bullshit of the president with the ambassador in the inside pages. There are even some who do not say anything. Fucking chinese box infallible! They phoned me from Los Pinos, to thank us. Bravo. - Thanks Pepe. We did not hurt went out with the governor's ratings? 22 points. After, I think you have a little abuse with the narco stuff. I just hope that the cure of the complaint is not going to cost us more expensive than the disease, look. And you really believe that they are not them? This news comes confirm my arguments. The governor's campaign Carmelo Vargas, was funded by illicit means. And come to confirm the thesis that I have been expressing since so long. Governors in Mexico, in addition to taking for kings, are connected with organized crime. Just what we missed. These fucking jackals with their same songs. This fucking TV stuffed with hyenas and vultures! Godfather, I would not want to add but the scandal is on all social networks. Hashtags "What does the governor renounce" and "the man of the suitcases" are the hot topics of the moment. And more than eight columns a day we are dedicated. How many times have I already told you not to come to annoy me with his bullshit, Poncho? And my constituents, the newspaper they use it just for wrap the sandwiches and Wash tiles. TV ! The fucking TV it's the only thing who counts for these fools. Indeed, godfather so let me to take care of the negotiation. Do you have the dough? Yes, I took a pair of millions more if it gets complicated. You'll see how I'm going quickly solve this shit, Poncho. Even these TV drunks can not resist being polished like this. Please, I beg you excuse for waiting. Over here the governor, We will catch up. And Don Alejandro, will not come? Sorry Don Carmelo He had to go to an emergency meeting, but asked me to greet you. Please sit down. Well, as you know Don Jos?, in my area, we are very direct and I do not like to go by four paths. What happened yesterday, I was pissed off. I sincerely apologize, but you know well that our only mission is to make light on the truth. Now if you want to complain, you are perfectly entitled to it. No, no, Don Jos?, That's not what it's about. Is there not another way to fix things? Send me this bullshit, without even telling me: - "We have something for you!" I'm sorry for all that. But our editorial policy and our ethical and moral code are very strict and do not we do not allow it. Listen to Don Jos?, as my father said: "Moral is a fucking shrub who does not feel anything, gives nothing, and is useless " You know very well that I am in this business for years and to prove to you my good faith, I have a gift with me for you to calm down, and that we can turn the page. What do you think ? Sorry Don Carmelo, but I'm not sure to understand you well. - Show us Oscar. - Yes, Mr. Mr. Governor, by respect and courtesy, we will ignore your offer. If you want to make an offer to our foundation you can make a deposit directly to our bank. No no no, it's a misunderstanding Don Jose, of course that money is for your foundation. How can you to imagine something else? So, thank you for your generosity. Ivana. Yes liciensado? Ivana, M. The governor is the favor of this gift. I charge you to give him a receipt at the exit, please. Of course, with great pleasure. allow Can I speak, godfather? Pepe, as you know, we have a serious problem image in the country. The governor did a great job but the opposition does not stop, to criticize us. And news like yesterday, frankly do not help us much. So we came order a marketing package, image consulting, political advertising, as you already did with others. We should have started by that, my friends. We are a company, and as such, we are committed to giving the best to our investors. - Yes Yes it is true - Of course. And for our government clients As you claim to be, we have different packages advice and positioning. But without lying to you, in view of your situation, I advise you directly our Premium Pack. And what is this pack? Well, in the big lines and without going into details, you pay 3% of your federal assistance and 50% of your costs of social communication at our station. We offer you a consulting in positioning and an advertising pack "Prime Time". And the most important, "political crisis management". Like the one you are currently living. Forgive me Don Jos?, it's a lot of money. We are talking about something like $ 20 million. - We would have to mortgage the state - Oscar! Mr. Governor, in this life there are things that money can not buy. And I think your political future worth more than that. You are absolutely right, Don Jos?. I'm just going to ask you a favor. Tell me my friend. As for the last election, when you helped the Golden Boy Could we work, to put myself in the presidential race? I'm sorry, Mr. Governor but you do not know very well what we are talking about. For that you would have to mortgage the state. But be patient, we will proceed in stages. If then both parties are satisfied, we can meet and consider following. Don Jos?, let's go, money is not a problem. My big state can give that and more. Don Jos?, my future is in your hands. Imagine that this jerk happens to become president. How much would it take for you? 300 million dollars? You're really good for negotiations, I still have a lot to learn. Pepe, I beg you, do not put me on it. This is the first time I directs the newspaper and I would not want miss this opportunity. Do not be stupid Carlitos. You forget that it's you who did we bring the customer back? I do not ask you not your stupid opinion, I give you an order. Come on ... If all goes well... and you persuade this asshole to mortgage his condition, I do not offer you only the newspaper, but the vice presidency some information. The vice-presidency? You go there, you make sure that all this mess is calm. Do interviews and reports for Javier, and so that you do not quibble, I will send our reporter star, what do you think ? Fuck Pepe, there there is no only narcotics and killings. Ha, forget all things related to violence. Remember that we signed an agreement to improve the image of this country. Good, very good I will reflect on the road how to improve the image this asshole. Good attitude. Take this ! For your expenses. Put yourself in the shoes. "The poor also like" What do you think, Jasmine? To our impossible love. Our love is not enough to erase our differences. Jasmine, between you and me, there is no difference It is time to reveal the truth. What are you saying ? You are not a mere maid, Mr Leonardo de la Garza confessed to being your real father and you are his heiress. There is nothing left to separate us. Rafael. Rafael Lascurain, can I know what you do in the arms of the maid? You want to know how much do you do your tele-novela? A lot, they have already signed for 50 more chapters, and they will give a more twist sexy to my character. 28 points and it goes up. Our bosses are really geniuses. And precisely for that, I better be good with Pepe. Imagine that he gives me the vice-presidency. Tell me, how many days will you be absent? - I do not know maybe a week or more. Hold on ! Good evening, how are you ? Very good, did you listen to my message? Okay. I just want you stay alert we might need from you for a job. thank you very much Good evening. - Is everything ok my love? - Very well, my queen. It's just that I need from you for another little job. Look at this place. Well, I did some research the state of our governor is in all still in last place health, education, economic development... If you saw other countries in which they send me Wait to see the governor and you will tell that it has nothing to envy to African dictators. I saw Javier's interview and it seemed great when he says that he It is not him. Fortunately Javier cut it quickly. Carlos, do not take it badly, but do not you think Javier and the whole newspaper team have their time? We could do something really better. Sorry Ricardo, but I do not agree Javier is an institution. Viewers believe blindly everything he says and for the political class it is a pillar of the system. But they are very old fashion, they are part of those who still think that newspapers read on paper. Maybe you're right, but there is a small detail, the boss likes him like a father. So I advise you not to to meddle with that. Well, what are the hightlight of the state? You never came here? No, I'm just traveling where we ask for a passport, dad. Look, here you want your hightlight of the corner. Whore, Carlos, where did you bring me? Ramon, tell the convoy that we will stop. - We'll make a decision, are you ready? - Of course "Welcome to Pd in earth of Mazacote. Here we have crazy bosses. To those who would like ... " Stay a little there, then go down Well, we break. Carlos. There is a problem, Mr.? What are you doing here, little whites? We are Mexican TV. we came to do a report on the state. TV? Do you think I'm blind, man? Ok, let's see these vans. Search them! Sorry, we have an appointment with ... Listen, man, if you move I'll put a little lead in your ass. What do you think ? What do you think ? And if there is one who moves, I stammer you all. - It's better to obey, no? - Yes, I'm silent. What is happening ? Boss, I'm with people of Mexican television they say they will work with the governor. Oh yes it's true, but tell them that if they make a video like the other day we're going to smash them, okay? Yes Boss. Ok Abrutis, my boss spoke with the Governor's staff and it seems that everything is fine. But my boss send you a message If you make a shit like the last time, to play a video from the Governor on TV, we will put it to you very deep and you'll remember, assholes. - Yes, Mr. - Including ? Yes, Mr. - Hey, Ricardo! - Break yourself! Can you take a picture with us? Of course ! It's my mother is one of your admirers. And I'm sure she will love. - Take a picture of us guy. - Yes. Come on guys, photo, the picture ! - Warning. - Do not worry about me. Do not tell me there was not another Hotel Alfonso. Even in the worst city of Africa, there is Hilton 5 star. Ricardo, this hotel belongs to the governor's brother and we have a cooperation agreement. The governor is really embarrassed what happened to you on the way and we have prepared a party to excuse us. Without being rude prosecutor but we would like to settle down and get to work, we will celebrate later. I just hope our governor will not be sorry because he had already invited friends and girlfriends to accompany you. I need you to organize tomorrow morning a meeting with the team. We must plan the campaign. I also need you to bring me all the information on the state, photos, videos, reports, statistics anything that can help us to make a comparison between before arrival from the governor and now. New schools, new hospitals, new roads. Anything that could help us to show the good he did will be able to serve us. I will look for everything what you need, but ... do not expect anything extraordinary. Well, again sorry for what happened on the road, anyway I asked a patrol to protect you. Thank you. - Mr Carlos. - Prosecutor. Here is my phone, everything you need... Thank you, Alfonso. Here m.. - And also that of Mr. Diaz. - Of course. I arrive. M. Carlos Rojo ? - Yes. - Good evening, Mr Carlos. Sorry to come disturb without warning but I wish the good of the state and it was urgent to speak with you. Well, how can I help you? My name is Agustin Morales. I am the Leader of the Opposition at the State Congress. Tell me, MP, what can I do for you ? May I come in ? I want to talk to you about a very delicate subject. Yes, please, come in. Excuse the mess but we are barely there. Please. Sit. Thank you, do not worry, you are very friendly. I promise you not to to disturb you a long time. Tell me. To begin, I want you thank for the great contribution from your station to democracy and in pursuit of justice, who never existed in this state. Sorry, MP, I do not understand. When I sent the video to the presidency to denounce the corrupted Vargas, I did not think she would be distributed nationally. And that would have such an impact. - You sent the video? - Exactly, Mr Carlos. And it seems that finally this president wants to end the corruption. Thank you for your broadcast in the main newspaper It's like a detonator so that the people can wake up and finally free from the mafia of our state led by the cynical Vargas. You do not need to thank me, we do that by pure journalistic interest. But in addition to thanking you personally from your work I came to invite you to attend the solemn session of the Congress, in which we will write the story. We will ask for resignation of the Governor. You are going to ask resignation of the governor? I'm sure your presence, besides being an honor will also be a factor of success. Thank you for your invitation, and certainly I will be there. Where and when will the session be held? Tomorrow at 9:00 precisely. I will leave you Mr. Carlos. You can now count on me as an unconditional friend. And I promise you that together, we will be light and hope of this poor people abandoned by God. We'll see that tomorrow, MP, and good luck. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - See you tomorrow. - I wish you a good evening. Damn, damn deputy! - What's going on Ricardo? - How are you, Carlos? We are in the shit. What is happening ? Just passed a crazy whore telling me that thanks to the videos that we spent with Javier he will ask for resignation Governor Vargas. Another one of those enlightened who are inspired by looking at the newspaper. - Much worse ! It is the leader of the opposition at the local Congress and it seems he has already prepared his little sketch. You know what ? We must warn the governor. Gentlemen, welcome to our beautiful country. Fortunately you are decided, the party is great! The governor was beginning to be upset about your absence. We will see how he will take the news we are going to give him. Did something happen? In my room came by surprise a deputy a certain Agust?n Morales, that surely you know well. And told me live that tomorrow morning, he will ask for resignation from the governor to the congress. And he seemed well decided. I know him very well since a long time, he was the rival governor in previous elections. And since his defeat the bastard did not stop to try to overthrow us. And how dangerous is it? A little. The son of a bitch is that kind of crazy obsessed with justice, equality, democracy, the governor calls him the messiah. The messiah, well, it does not hurt him. If you can pay attention to how you will announce it to the governor. It's been a while since would like to put him some lead to this son of a bitch, it would not be good to give him an excuse. No. The least we have need right now it's another scandal. We agree. How are you guys? So, finished pinball? What do you believe? I have to put the hands again. Its good. Sorry, guys, but here comes only the high society of the state. Governor ! Welcome guys! Listen to old man, I want to introduce you to these young people who are the ones who are going make me become president. Nice to meet you guys Take good care of the boss. And without informing, big clever. - I let you talk to each other. - It's old. It's good that you came. This holiday is for you. My stupid collaborators told me that you would not come. - A thousand thanks governor, but in fact we came for to talk to you about something urgent. Go there, my friend, for my friends I do not have a secret. But before that, drink something. Hey, Lucrecio! Serve something to my guests. In fact it is a subject a little tricky. Could we speak with more privacy? What young people so hardworking! I like it, come here. Hey girls, look after our star and talk to him about beautiful things of our state. - So what is it? - It's about Mr. Morales. I spoke with him and he told me that tomorrow he will ask for your resignation to Congress. My resignation ! Maudit Morales, son of his fucking mother whore. This asshole thinks he's the messiah. We will put him a good freak to stop trying to fuck me for good. In fact, I do not think that it is a good idea. I think that right now it is better to that the meeting tomorrow goes unnoticed to avoid another scandal. Je vais en parler ? mes d?put?s, here and at the Federal Congress, we have the majority. And we hold a big part of the opposition on our side. I will give instructions to convince them to prevent him from speaking. Do what you want, but it is very important that spend a few days, and calm down the story of the video. Tomorrow, I'll explain my strategy. But I repeat, Most important, is not to provoke another scandal, and make the situation worse. I understood my guy, I'm not as stupid as you think. And I am convinced of the value of dialogue and pacifism in the Mexican politics. Take good care of him governor. Now, let's go drinking and enjoy the company of girls, who are a courtesy from my government. Governor, I would not like not look rude, but tomorrow we have to we wake up early to work. Do not worry, I will handle that. Do not tell me you do not like not the good women? He says to himself that on television it swarms with tantouzes. - No no no... - Come on! The little train ! Carmelo Vargas, Get fucked and fuck yourself! Carmelo Vargas! My dear colleagues, I know I'm being criticized by the governor and by many of you who accuse me of harming in the image of our state. But these are not my words which affect the most, but all actions of impunity and corruption that the governor Vargas has committed. Many of you... - Many of you... - Silence! Quiet Please ! Continue Mr. Member. Thank you, Madam Chair Many of you have doubted ... evidence that I already showed you and documents showing how disproportionate and scandalous of the enrichment of the governor. But after... But after... But after seeing the videos broadcast on a national media, shame on our state! So I suggest you this: demand resignation immediate governor and his gang of delinquents that harm our state. Vargas out! Take it out! He is hurt ! The member is hurt! Governor, this is the worst that could happen to us. Now, not only we have to work on the impact of videos, which unfortunately continue to appear in the newspapers. But also to reactions to the attack. You're right Carlos. All my collaborators are morons. A thousand times I told them that if they were to kill one, the worst thing would be to leave him alive. Do not worry Mr. Governor. MP and out of danger and we will make sure that the culprits accept the entire responsibility. The problem is that there was a lot of media present, and if for some reason the news is made public the pressure for you d?missionniez will come directly from Los Pinos. With the local media do not worry not, all are paid by the state and publish only this that we ask. Gentlemen, a shootout at Congress, even local, is a national news. Unfortunately, my dear little Carlos, now the problem is as well as yours as mine. But you can solve everything, that's why I pay a fortune on your television, is not it ? I think the best option and use the Chinese box. What do they have to see these whores Chinese with that? I will explain to you the Chinese box. We must find another info. Something relevant, to spread the bombing in the background. An info to which people can identify themselves. That's the Chinese box. But here we have only shootings and executions. Just this morning, we found eight dead in a stadium, you think that would go? No, captain do you have an idea? No, I just received reports bloody, look. No We must now hide this type of information for not that people think that kind of things happen. In addition, the viewers are already tired of so much blood and to be quite honest I do not think it's a good idea to talk murders and beheadings in your state. Carlos, I do not think that we understand you well. What exactly do you think? I think of a ... sex scandal from someone important ... A natural disaster. Remember the miners trapped ? Something like that. A story with which people are busy and stop thinking about the resignation of the governor. It's just that we have some need very quickly to be able to put it in the newspaper of the day. Come on guys ! Let's boss and think! Let's find a good bullshit, we must help the Carlitos. - Let's go! - Excuse me, dear. - Goodbye, very expensive. - Goodbye, Mr. Do not worry Carlos, we will find something. let's wander in the forest while the wolf is not there If the wolf was there, he would eat us Wolf are you there? No ! I'm in the shower. I showed you my pictures from Los Angeles? - No, show me - Look. Here it is when I arrive, and then I... - Pancho, wait! ... you want to eat us. - Wolf are you there? - Et regarde ici, les gens start to eat, but ... - Calm down, leave me alone! - A last ? - But just the photo! Look, do you see who's in this park? Stay calm, I already told you! - And the little ones, Pancho? - I do not know. Ana ! Elena ! Ana ! Elena ! Ana ! Elena ! Ana ! Elena ! Carrelage, these binoculars are a marvel. What can you tell me about the family? Nothing exceptional, Mr. Carlos. The father is a small businessman and the mother takes care of the house. It seems that girls were playing in the square and the good girl was having a good time with her boyfriend. And when she looked for them they had disappeared. The mother went crazy. My Prosecutor, find me all of the information and tell parents that we go there. Martin, you go on them. Tonio, on Ricardo. - Luc?a, can we talk with you? - Of course. We want you to explain in the simplest way but with a lot of emotion, everything that happened. Do not be nervous, I am here to help you, and if necessary, we will make several takes. Thank you, but in fact, I do not know if I can I am devastated ... - Calm down, everything will be fine. Ok, Mr. And Mrs. Garza, it is very simple. Ricardo will ask you some questions When he looks at you, you look at it and when you answer, you are looking at the camera. Questions ? Ok, we'll shoot. Five, four, three, two... Tonight we are in the house of Luc?a and Salvador Garza who will tell us and share with us the drama they live. Their two little girls, the twins Anna and Elena have disappeared this morning from their own house. Lucia, tell us what happened? Well this morning I was in the bathroom when Juanita, the nanny girls, ran, to tell me she no longer found them. They played in the garden and right after, they were gone. How, they are gone like that? At first we thought they could to be in a neighbor's house so we looked for them everywhere, but without result. So I started to despair and I called Salvador to work and we have them searched all three in the whole neighborhood, but nothing. Then Salvador decided to call the police, but so far we have no news. Have you thought of a kidnapping? No. We are not rich. No ! No, we have no enemies. We are a family of middle class, you can not ... Salvador, do you have any relations with organized crime, or a company that could Being guilty, gambling debts or maybe revenge some of your employees? You do not suspect anyone? Listen, Ricardo, we are good people. We never hurt anyone. I beg anyone who could to have seen something or who know where my daughters are of, please communicate with us or call the police. All information could be very useful. Please, please help me find them, we are desperate ... Cut! All right, Luc?a. It's just if you could do it in front of the camera with the picture of the girls. And something else, do not wipe your tears. Okay ? There are millions of people watching, you do not imagine how it could help. It works ? The photo is there. Take your time. Very good. - A bit higher - How is that? Here is perfect, thank you. We are good people, Ricardo. We would never do from harm to person. If you have saw something, or know where my daughters are. Let him call us or call the police, The slightest information is essential. Help me find them, we are desperate, please ! Once again Javier we are witnesses a terrible story, who calls for solidarity and encourages us to give the best of us. Finally, I inform you that Governor Vargas will trigger a big operation to look for the little ones. As soon as he learned about the disappearance, Governor Carmelo Vargas wanted to personally lead looking for binoculars Anna and Elena. - Let's go, we'll pick up. - Yes, governor. Look in the corner! To find a trace of these poor little the governor mobilized all state security organs and committed to work tirelessly until he finds them. But unfortunately so far The research did not give No result. We will come back to you and will continue to inform you. For 24 hours in 30 minutes, Ricardo Diaz. - Thank you Ricardo. And that's it, the drama of a family like the others which in minutes, and by a little negligence, changed his life forever. I'm sure you will you ask what will be the destiny of these two little girls in a world like ours ? Our colleague Laura Cardenas we prepared this report. Javier, I inform you that today was arrested a group of pimps who kept in bondage girls from 12 to 19 years old. The prosecutor informed us that this group of delinquents had connections with a network of pederasts who not only exploited sexually minors, but also produced pornographic material for the market ... - How are they, Juanita? They are good boss. At first, they were crying a lot and did not want to sleep, but now they are calm. - Take care of them. - Yes Boss. And do not take their eyes off them. And that I do not see you sleeping! No, do not worry. In Mexico every year thousands of children disappear. Studies and statistics around the world demonstrate that child trafficking, like drug trafficking and buying weapons are a business the most profitable for international mafias. White slave, child slavery to sexual exploitation ... Hey, boss! And if we do what they do say on TV, and that we sell the girls to a pimp. We would not earn more money? They are so cute. Imagine what we would be given for those little eyes, those little hands and these fragile little hearts ... Stop saying bullshit cocks! From the beginning we said well that things it would do my way. And whoever does not agree can break right away. Including ? From $ 10,000 to $ 150,000 depending on the chosen destination. For 24 hours in 30 minutes, I'm Laura Cardenas. To you the antenna, Javier. So Pepe, what is it? Deadly! No, no, I loved it the report, it was great the thing prostitutes. Yes, I saw the number post Facebook and Tweet, it's a bomb. Tell me how much we did? And from? Fucking shit, it's almost like telenovela. No do not worry, I have everything under control. Perfect. Congratulations to you too. Goodbye. As you can see, the strategy was a success. No media mentions cheating the governor or the attack against the deputy Morales. You are a genius, Carlos. My godfather is happy. It must still be a train to celebrate that sick person. What do we know about Morales deputy? He is out of danger, he will be out in a few days. And the small survey, Attorney? Not a lot of news, Mr. Carlos. We continue the research and the most interesting now is that it seems like ... the Garza have economic problems. The maid tells us that the marriage is not going very well, and that the woman ... without us being able to prove it, would have a lover. Tell me prosecutor, I do not would not like to get involved with your work, but is it certain that none of you Be behind the disappearance of girls? This is an assumption which can not be excluded. From what you tell me, if you continue to dig the Garza affair, I am sure you will find dirty things. 24 hours in 30 minutes SPECIAL EDITION Javier, we are in front the house of the Garza family, where the investigation on the disappearing binoculars, took a surprising turn. So we have you prepared the following report. At the first hour the prosecutor from the state informed us have discovered several inconsistencies and contradictions in the statement of parents. The Garza were in our premises until very late at night. But unfortunately, when we compared different versions We found inconsistencies Which reveals, according to our criteria, that a premeditated action was in place to hide important information, and serious charges. The image of this couple, which seemed initially exemplary, chipped away little by little in the light of our cameras and appearances broke. A relationship where lies, betrayals, and disenchantment, are the daily bread. Luc?a, tell us the relationship with your husband, we know that you have already had problems. Ricardo, I would like to tell you that, yes, we had difficulties like all couples. Sometimes we argue, but like all marriages, no? But it is said that Salvador would have already left home a month What happened in your relationship to make it happen to this serious decision causing the disappearance of girls? And when everything seemed that we were only witnesses of a family crisis, the statement of Juana Casimiro, the nanny of the girls took a turn at 180 degrees to the case. Juanita, how many years do you work with the family? Five years. When girls are born, they hired me to help them. And, is it true that the couple meets a lot of problems ? Especially when Mr. learned that madam had a lover He even left the house. Tell us, how did he learn? Do not tell me that the lover was sleeping in the house? Yes. Salvador Garza, the father of girls told us that his company was almost bankrupt. Salvador, he says to himself that you have serious economic problems and that for that your marriage, is going through a deep crisis. Do not you think that this could have a report with the disappearance of your daughters? Sincerely Ricardo, I do not see the relationship between all this. That's right my company goes through a bad patch. Yes, I had some problems in my marriage with Luc?a. But why do you think that this is related to the disappearance of my daughters? Sorry Salvador, but for me it's obvious. Mr G?mez, the lover of Luc?a Garza, known in the state for his reputation of heartbreaker, refused to be interviewed, showing an attitude that we can consider as arrogant and aggressive, and who proves without a doubt that he is hiding something. - Mr G?mez ... - Turn off this camera! Mr. G?mez, we know that you had a relationship with the girls' mother and slept in this house the day before the disappearance. - What can you say? - Fucked! It's your fault if the country is as it is. And I ask you to respect my privacy. Excuse me ! - Why do not you want to answer ... - Leave me! So it's over this day full of revelations and surprises. Crown decided to ask remand and new interrogations in the prosecutor's offices. This afternoon, after their statements to the prosecutor the Garza couple, the nanny Juana Casimiro and Manuel G?mez, the probable lover of Luc?a Garza will remain in custody in a motel in the capital, accused of being the main suspects the disappearance of girls. We remain present on site to follow all information that could happen. And we will continue to inform you. For 24 hours in 30 minutes Ricardo Diaz. - Thank you, Ricardo. Undoubtedly this confirms every day that in this country, it becomes more in more difficult to trust appearances. And you who follow us comfortably installed, we invite you to participate to our question of the day: Who do you think is most responsible the disappearance of binoculars? The options are: To the mother. B) The father. C) The boyfriend. D) The nanny. We invite you to participate by phones. But now, we dispose first results: Mother would be the main responsible with 46% The father follows her very close, with 43% The boyfriend is far with 8% Finally the nanny, symbolically, 3% Keep calling us, and let us share your opinion. 28 points of audition and 49 shares, I totally agree with you, it's a cardboard. Hey Pepe, thank you very much for this opportunity you do not imagine how much I'm grateful. Of course, I tell Ricardo. Goodbye. Yes. Don Carlos, good evening. I'm not bothering you ? No, no, do not worry Attorney, what's up? I just wanted to tell you that I have just released the parents of the girls. You sucker prosecutor, why not warn me? Sorry Carlos, I had no choice. We have a witness who saw guys on board small and his lawyer forced me. How a witness? Listen to me carefully, keep it to me, I'm coming, and he does not speak to anyone until I arrive, Okay ? Yes, Don Carlos. Fucking shit ...! So asshole, repeat what you said. Yes Boss. That's the day we kidnapped the girls, I worked in a house. It was around 11:30 when all of a sudden I saw two wankers take the binoculars wrapped in covers. They fucked them in a van another guy was driving. And they ran away quickly. Why did not you say anything before? Because after have seen on TV, I thought there would be a good reward. Here is your reward, son of a bitch! Enough ! Enough ! And you can identify these guys? Of course boss. I gave the description to the inspector. No real chef? Let's go talk next. What do you think ? It's standing. We have already done some research and the guy seems to be telling the truth. Moreover, he has already identified two of the offenders, two little thieves, look. What will you do with him? We have to let him go. There is nothing to incriminate him. Unless you have need something else. No, with what you put him he must already have enough repent of having opened it. Anyway, can you give me his coordinates in case we need from him for an interview? His name is Augusto Serv?n, he lives in a neighborhood called cardboard. Here is all the information. - Deputy Morales! - Good evening, Mr Carlos. What are you doing here ? I apologize, to be entered this way, But as you have noticed, my life is in danger and I have to be careful. I do not know if you are exaggerating and I do not know if I can still help you. Much more than you think. My life does not have importance if in the end I can accomplish my mission of end with Vargas and his mafia. Remember the words from St. Augustin: "The blood of martyrs is the seed of freedom ". I find that very cute and romantic but tell me what do you think. You know that we also we are interested by the fall of the governor? Can you look this, please? What's still MP? Another proof of cheating disgusting of the governor. At this point, nothing do not surprise me. I just want you to watch and listen carefully. I told you my friend, I'm not like the morons of the opposition. I respect my commitments, here is your license. Which governor very greedy! I'm fine, the deal is done. Once I have the permit, I make the deposit. And to show you my affection, with the receipt I will send you two girls, more whores than girls. Haha, well my friend, but this time who speak Spanish! Russian whores you sent me last time when I asked them to suck me I had to make signs! Okay, but you have to that we are more discreet. It's not going to happen to us something as with the deputy Ram?rez who when he learned it also wanted his share, motherfucker! Do not worry, We will fix everything. And if another MP arrives who is looking for trouble, we smoke it like this Ramirez pork, and we continue. Well governor, always the practical sense I admire you, you are my hero. What do you think, Mr. Carlos? It's the deputy Ram?rez. Another martyr of democracy. Imagine, intellectual author of a homicide, white slave, money laundering and misappropriation of public money. Here are some of the pearls that you can see in this video and with which we can eliminate Vargas. And what do you want do we do with that? The same as last time, to pass it in the newspaper of Perez-Harris. I'm sure after that Vargas will have to resign. But we need to check the authenticity of the video, it could be a fake. Do not worry on this subject Mr. Carlos. I have a witness who saw Vargas give the order to kill my colleague. I'll check this with my bosses and I do not think that there will be objections. If you allow me I will give you something. It's a copy. Take good care of her. I recommend you to be very careful. You saw what this tyrant is capable. Do not doubt. the triumph of our mission is much more important that our destiny. - Excuse me. - Yes. - Good evening Member of Parliament - Good evening, Don Carlos. Fucking fucking shit! Another danger for Mexico. Oscar, can you organize me an urgent meeting with the governor tomorrow morning at the first hour? It's not going to happen to us something as with the deputy Ram?rez who when he learned it also wanted his share, motherfucker! - Do not worry, we will fix everything. And if another MP arrives who is looking for trouble, we smoke it like this Ramirez pork, and we continue ... What do you want me to do say, Don Carlos? That it was not me? So I tell you. It was not me ! Governor it's about serious accusations if for any reason it becomes public, we have to start again to zero, and I'm not sure that this time we will succeed! Let's not be stupid, you and I know that TV can do everything, right? Certainly my friend, but I did not imagine that it was so ... - If what ? If rotten? Do not be naive Carlitos, do not do the child, it's the game of politics! Give me the name of a governor or president who finished his term without two or three deaths in the closet. And some even before of elected beings. Have you forgotten the dark stories from our current President? Here, the problem is the conjuncture. The deputy Morales is not not alone in there. These fucking deputies I'm shaking it! What is going on my guy? Do not try to fuck me man! Yes, yes, he is with me. I will tell him ! But do you apply to solve that shit. Something happened Governor thing? Now we are really in the shit. Fucking girls Garza are sequestered! Sequestered? Governor, I think we just won the lottery. But I will need all your support. Listen Salvador, I understand perfectly the crisis you're going through. But you have to decide quickly. They have just asked one million dollars we have to do Something. But we do not know if it's the best way. I would like to talk about it to our lawyer before. The only thing I want it's recovering my daughters. The message was clear, they do not want that the police intervene. Give me the order and I send them back. Yes, but the $ 50,000 that you propose to me seem to me very little. - OK, I'll talk to my bosses and I get you 100,000. By cons you sign me the exclusivity contract. Yes. Where will we find the rest? You can mortgage the house with the television bank. You know, I have a recommendation with them. Salvador sign, sign. A initials on each sheet, and a signature at the end. - Luc?a, you too have to sign. - Yes. Just remember that nobody can not approach, not even at the window without my permission. Including ? Documents are in order and that is the situation, prosecutor. You're sure Carlos you do not have no need of us? Because these kidnappers are experienced thieves. Do not worry, if something happens I'm warning you, you or Captain Gordoa. We remain available, you know we are there to help you. Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor. Captain. - We are here for you. - Thank you very much. ?coutez attentivement. This is a private property and I ask you to leave. Silence, silence! Push yourself, push yourself! Do you see the guardhouse? And well behind! And quickly! And those who play the idiots, I fuck them in jail! Go! Move on ! Let them watch the light, and that they do not cover themselves. Luc?a, Salvador, when we will be live do not hide your face and pay attention to the light, ok? Something else... If you can give the impression that you still love yourself a little. Tonio when I refer to them, you film their faces and you maintain the zoom. The table please. Governor, how are things with the text? - We are almost live. - Oh damn, it's alright! It's very important that you showed insurance but especially that we do not do not notice that you read. Do not worry my bitch! You'll see how I'm going do better than the President! I also ask you to moderate your vocabulary. You tell me, I'm listening to you. Good evening You watch 24 hours in 30 minutes. I am Javier P?rez-Harris, and here are the main informations.

And just because there are witnesses, I will not kiss you. When I imagine you soaking your noodle! The little Jasmine is the slut of my dreams! - With your governor's permission. - Please.

It would not be good to do that at once? Or why not send a few little fingers or little small ears? To put pressure on them? No boss, for God's sake do not hurt them. Do not worry, do not listen these two morons. In addition, parents need time to get the money. ... rejected the legalization of consumption as a miracle solution.

It was the news of the day, we are waiting for you tomorrow in this information space. Good evening. What gang of bastards shameless ! They did not even mention, not one! Maybe tomorrow, liciensado. They dedicated the newspaper to these poor girls. Do not be stupid, Manuel. Now I realize that all this is a conspiracy to divert attention. But I know who will to be able to explain. Alfonso Sir. Thank you, Juanita. - I can not anymore. - I told you my Richard, more than 35 points of audimat, almost as much as the football finals, We are almost there. I just talked to Pepe, and he told me that Alejandro is happy. - I know Carlos, but we have to stay here in this abyss. Today, I'm romantic, and I want to go out with the cats. Richard, think carefully. We are currently to write history of Mexican television and you complain. The kidnappers can call at any moment, imagine it live! You really are a big sick person. And well in wartime, all the holes are important ... What's going on Richard? Nothing, I'm worried about you. How are you ? Ricardo, what do you want what do I tell you? I'm desperate, I feel very alone. Yes, I think you need to relax. Come, let's talk. Good evening member. Here are the documents. You do not imagine how he it was difficult to get them back. Thank you very much young man. Here is the money, I do not know if you want to count. I think it is Perfect as usual. I want to ask you a deputy favor. I beg you to be more discreet, this time. This is more delicate than videos. No do not worry, I swear I'll be a grave. And besides, I would like to remind you that my offer to join our party still holds. - We need people like you. - Thank you very much. We will talk about that a bit later. Good luck. That's it ! Tell me. Don Carlos? Yes. - It's the deputy Morales. - Deputy, how are you? Why do not you kept your promise? I am sorry, I do not know why they did not pass it. You must understand that this is not me who makes that kind of decision. We have to see each other urgently, I have with me something that you will not be able to hide. What is it about ? Something that involves your station and Governor Vargas. I'm sure this is not going not leave your bosses indifferent. Yes, tell me, where can we meet? In Congress. At 9:00 sharp. I would be there without fault. Good evening. Good evening. Hello Don Carlos, thank you for your punctuality. Member of Parliament, how can I help you? You ask yourself why did I bring you here? I guess it's because that you work here. No Don Carlos. I called you here because this place represents more than a simple parliamentary precinct. This Congress, as simple as he can you appear, is the last hope of many people, tired of impunity, corruption and lies. Congratulations, MP, congratulations! In fact I do not have brought cameras and I do not know where you want to go. and I do not know where you want to go. A stupid provincial deputy that can be treated as an abode. No deputy, not at this point. You were mistaken Don Carlos. Have you ever heard that he there were no small enemies? Or are you going to tell me that this is not the reason why are you boycotting me? And that you spend your time to protect this corrupted Vargas. These are the copies of the contracts that our honorable governor signed with your company. To make us swallow the story girls sequestered. And proof that it is a gift from broadcasters to our governor to make him a defender of justice in prime time! You're wrong, MP, Because these contracts are trade agreements That we have with all states including the federal government. Do not insult my intelligence. You know what your enemies would give or your competition to obtain this information? Think about what would happen the value of your shares? - You want us to sing? - No ! No, Don Carlos. "The lion thinks that all are like him " but thank God, in this country there are still some honest politicians. Well MP, go to the goal. What do you want ? What I want, and it's a right guaranteed by the Constitution, and a space in the newspaper from P?rez-Harris to present the evidence in my possession against the governor. Ten minutes live in prime time, not a minute less. You say you do not do not make me sing, but do you know how much are 10 minutes of Prime Time? I have no doubt on the fact that cynicism is the editorial line of your company. I let you think in this forum dedicated to democracy. I'm waiting for your call before noon. If not, tell your leaders to be ready to suffer the consequences. Hello Lupita, can you pass me Pepe? - He's in Carlos meeting. - I do not care, tell him it's urgent. What do you want Carlos? I'm sorry Pepe, but we have serious problems. - Did something happen to the twins? - No, no it's okay. The problem is that the leader of the Congress got our contract with the governor and that he is about to publish it. Son of a bitch! And how did he do it? I do not have any the least fucking idea. I do not have any the least fucking idea. They are all the same fucking shit bureaucrats. No, the problem he does not want money. How can he not want the dough? You're wrong, Carlos, that's why. He wants 10 minutes in the P?rez-Harris newspaper To talk about all the shits that you imagine on the governor. Listen, listen to me, that's what you'll do. You're going to tell this jerk that we agree. I'll handle the rest, did you understand? Ok, I confirm him. You call me after talking with this son of a bitch, You call me immediately! I take care of it, more. Mr. Harman, the president is online. So, Pepe? Hi Mr. President, how are you? Well thank you, tell me. I have a galley here I need you help me How may I help you ? Well, you see that contracts of the box are out, and that a certain Agust?n Morales want us to sing. - And what can I do? - How what ? Make work your henchmen and they send us all information about it. Okay, I'll warn the government secretariat to see what they can do. Great, it's just he it takes before 17:00. Because it's urgent. Send it to me with the general directly to my office. Yes Pepe, do not worry, I call you. - Hey, une derni?re chose. - What? Who takes care of your neckties? Why ? It's always the same, I will send you news. Perfect. - Take care of yourself. - You too Pepe. Everything seems clear to you Carlitos? Very clear Pepe. And the conversation, she is ready ? As soon as I can, I show it to the governor, and I will explain to him that this comes directly from the government. So I take care of the governor and you from the deputy Morales. What did you say to Morales? I told him to come at the studio at 8:00. Perfect. Listen Carlos, in this case you'll have to give it your all. You have to do two things at once and neglect none. The governor and the girls. I can count on you for that or not? Do not worry boss, everything will be settled before dinner. You insure, I leave you. Alfonso ? Good evening member. What can I help you with ? I need your help again. And what is it this time, liciensado? Do you know if our friend, has a contract with TV people? I know things, but it is a very delicate subject. How delicate? Twice as delicate than last time. In addition to the other we agreed. OK, but that makes me sad for today. I see you at the same place at midnight and a half. Well my boy, I find you there. You see stupid. If we were not done with this motherfucker of Morales, none of this would have happened. They will take care of it in the capital. You must stop the leaks, and unfortunately it's up to you to charge you. But damn, who gave registration to your leaders? I do not know if it comes from government or directly from Los Pinos. Son of a bitch! When I think I took it out Green Party That Junior Fool! - Rosita. - Yes sir - Dites ? mon filleul de venir. - Of course sir Well governor, I leave you. I have to finish the report for tonight. No ! Stay here. You'll see how we settle things here. Sit down. It's not going to be long. Excuse me godfather. How are you Carlos? Sit down Poncho. Let's see Poncho, Carlos just told me that you are the one who gives the information to the deputy Morales. What do you have to answer to that? How can you to believe that of me, godfather? Kid, I just heard a recording between you and that son of a messiah bitch where everything is very clear! Have not I been generous with you? Did not I treat you as one of my children? Of course, yes, godfather. How can you believe that I will do you such a thing. Son of a bitch! The information comes from the presidency! I'm sorry, please. I know I did wrong, I did not think badly, I did it to pay a debt. Son of a bitch! He did not think badly! I knew that this little one would betray me. This is Carlos, we have a problem less. Now you can go work. And to clarify things, I want to go out with my head up of the kids' story. Including ? Yes governor. La patate chaude, je suis dans le pot... I'm going to town for call from a cabin. Stay on your guard and take good care of the girls. And do not try again to stuff your mouth, or to you send this shit! Do not worry boss. If I did not come back in two hours, You know what to do, right? Okay boss. Do you take us for amateurs? You are not amateurs, just fools. And watch over the boss Chole, This old is starting to love the girls. The hot potato, I'm in a pot, I had too much oil ... Castulo Serv?n? Yes ? Hard finger! I think Madam is right. It's better than I go away from home. No, Jasmine! She will go before you. And what are the conditions? Thanks liciensado but I did not leave anything as a guarantee and I think 150% interest per month are abuse, thank you. So Salvador, you're going go out with the money? Very bad. I made mortgaged the house by your bank. I sold the car and the jewels of Luc?a. I took out a loan that I will pay the rest of my life and I have barely $ 300,000. Listen, I'll see how my box could help you but you can count on $ 25,000 from me. Thank you. You can not imagine what I changed my mind about you. There is no problem. Do not answer ! Tonio, Martin! Let's go ! I'm here. Chava Are you ready ? Go ahead ! So bastard, Do you have my dough? I only have $ 300,000, but I would have you all. Listen, son of a bitch If you think I'm joking, you are really too stupid. I clearly told you that I do not settle for trifles. I will rape your girls, and then send you some little fingers for you to understand asshole! I beg you not to to hurt my daughters, give me two more days and I will find the money but do not make hurt our girls. They are... Salvador and Luc?a Garza An endless nightmare I apologize to you because ... tonight and exceptionally, I would like to share my personal opinion on what we have just seen. Rarely since 20 years that I present this diary, I felt an indignation as deep and such a feeling of helplessness that you must feel too. Think for a moment to what live the parents of these small and I'm sure that will wake up something in you. That's why on behalf Mexicana Television, Telebanco and our Foundation, that is possible. We invite you to show solidarity with these parents. And to wear as a symbol a yellow ribbon and to make a donation, bank details that appear on your screen. I remind you that... It does not matter whether it's a peso or two. The important thing is compassion and solidarity that we always have demonstrated in these moments. Thank you. Carlos, thank you from my heart. You'll see, everything will be fine and tomorrow you will get the money. Javier is a master, when it comes to moving people. Every time he uses donations, for floods earthquakes, street kids, it's amazing. Every time we have too much money. Don Carlos, there are people at the door. - Who is it ? - Neighbors. - We can go ? - Yes, please. Good evening Luisa, What is going on ?

Thank you. thank you very much Come on, he's still the best. Good evening MP, do not bother ! Good evening Mr. Harman, nice to meet you. I was reviewing what you brought us. I must admit, it's huge. I would like to take this opportunity to apologize to you I apologize for using these methods to get the interview. You do not need to apologize, Even if you will not believe me, I share your opinions. This country needs people brave like you who dare to denounce corruption and impunity. Thank you. It's normal. Are you missing something? No, not all is well. Well we will come to you look in a moment. - Nice to meet you and good luck. - Thank you very much. And in our newspaper we have a special guest tonight. Joined us on this board the deputy Agust?n Morales, who as you know is one of the biggest detractor of the governor Carmelo Vargas, And who would like to do us an important revelation. - Good evening member. - Good evening Javier. Thank you for the opportunity. MP before presenting the recording you we brought and give us your opinion, I would like to ask you a question. Of course, Javier. The name of Cynthia Gonz?lez does he mention something? Cynthia Gonzalez ... and no, not much. I just remember she was the girl of one of my maid. But I do not understand the question. Well, to refresh yourself a little memory see this testimony. I met Mr. Morales because my mother worked in his house. When we arrived, he was very kind to me. And always offered me many gifts. I never imagined that he had bad intentions. But after a while, when my mother was going shopping He took me to his room and made me do junk. Has he ever abused you? At first, he caressed me over my clothes and made sure that I touched him, but... But one night he had a lot more, he took off my clothes ... And my... Out of respect for you, it's better to stop there, because everyone can imagine what happened to this innocent girl in the hands of a depraved like the one who accompanies us. MP, you have us asked for an interview which we gladly accepted. Does not it seem to you that the moment has come to clarify this story? Or do you prefer to do it to the competent authorities and explain your links with the mafia child pornography ... - This is a slander! A slander! Take it out! No ! It's a slander! A slander! Of course not. Of course not. These offenders who feel protected think they can go around the world and perpetrate their crimes without giving explanations or be punished. That's why I'm telling you, no matter the color, or the party. All the same ! Good evening. Did not I tell you that idiot messiah would regret playing with me. The Prosecutor, tell the lady MP Dominguez to open tomorrow a case against him in order to put this depraved in prison. Of course governor. And you captain, ask to our friends a review order, to see what we can find. - Of course sir. - Well, I am tense, angry! As P?rez-Harris says: "Idiots of politics third division. " Finally, finished working for today, we have guests and we must receive them. You send serious, Governor. - Health gentlemen! - Health! And now, yes, friends! From here... in Los Pinos! Do you have links with the mafia of child pornography? They say you have links with child pornography. Room 325. Liciensado Morales, Excuse us, but on order of the manager you must leave your room and recover your belongings. Message to the public, to the President of Mexico and to all the media Communication. Ladies and gentlemen. Today was the day of more sad of my life. I know that after the violent media attack of which I was a victim my credibility has been questioned. I am nothing anymore. But maybe my story will help to put an end to the impunity of the mafias who dominate our country. Today, our democracy is threatened by the powers and the dummy monopolies, using a well-honed strategy to preserve their corrupt and their... Javier, I inform you we discovered today the body of the deputy Agust?n Morales It seems that he committed suicide in a downtown hotel from Mexico. And this after the scandal that you have unveiled. More details to come. Governor, as you know people are poor and the collection failed. If we do not recover the girls quickly, things could get complicated. We just have a few left hours before the ultimatum. How are the research going? For the moment without much result. We need more time. - And you, Commander? - Same sir. We had a witness, but someone shot him and we have no other leads - How so, we killed him? Strip of useless fools! We must solve that today. And it would be better to put you there if you do not want to finish suicide like my godson or the messiah. The problem is that parents need more time to collect the sum. And what do you suggest? You see I'm surrounded by incompetent! That you pay the million ransom dollars. Why me stupid? Well, that's the only way to break this deadlock without risking your career ... Listening to Carlitos do not take me for an idiot. I'm sure there will have enough money with parents and donations, Yes or no ? For me money is not not a problem. I will give you your million dollars in full. In exchange for a favor that you will not be able to refuse me. Tell me governor, I'm listening. I promise you not disappoint you. Move for the million. Yes sir. The poor also love I already told you a thousand times, Jasmine that I want you to do as I tell you, or you leave the house. I promise you that this does not happen will not reproduce Mada ... I'm tired of your excuses. I do not know why my brother insist on keeping you here. You know what, take your things and go away. No My mother is very sick madam, I can not stay out of work You will live in the street. - Two hundred and eighty thousand. - Hundred ? - There was 22 missing for the 28000. - Okay. Hundred... And three hundred. And then we have a hundred ... Carlos, if there is money left we can keep it? What do you mean ? If there is too much money it will go to the foundation. Do you think we're going to steal it? No of course not, but as I will stay with all his debts I thought that... Do not think, give up. - No, sorry. - Shut up Salvador Stop with these questions. Well, sorry if I I am poorly expressed, sorry. Ok, we do the same! We do the same! Answer, Chava. I listen. So son of a bitch, I heard on TV that you had the dough, it's true asshole? Yes, where do you want me to bring it? Not stupid, if you think that I'm going to settle of what I had asked, you are very foolish. Now I want two millions of dollars. I do not have more, I swear on my daughters! I have just 1 million, that's all they gave me ... It's okay PD, that's fine. You know the iron mine Near the train station ? Absolutely. You bring your ass here, you take your cell and you wait until I call you. But listen well son of a bitch no police and no joke where you can say goodbye to your girls whores. Understood, stupid? I leave immediately. - I have to go. - Chava! When you see the girls you call me to come and turn, ok? May the Virgin protect you from his sacred mantle. - Everything will be alright - Yes. Bring me back my daughters. I have to go ! Our Father who is in heaven Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as in heaven ... We are on the edge of the city. The lighthouses that you can distinguish in front of us are those of Mr. Garza's car, the father of the twins. He is on his way to deliver the million dollars asked by the kidnappers. We know that our lives are in danger, but our commitment is to inform at every moment. It seems we are coming on the meeting place, We can feel a great tension and nervousness but nothing will prevent us from bringing back at home this important success. It's good. Come on we'll climb. Carlos, wait! Hold on ! It's very dangerous, we do not know not even what's up there. Ricardo, imagine yourself the audience we will do! Come on, do not be afraid. And my daughters? - Where are my daughters? - Wait, fuck you - Where are they ? - Stop asking. Where are my daughters? You're going to close your mouth Kind of a bitch! Closes there asshole! I stop here. Carlos, I'm a icon for business, if something happens to you will you be responsible? Okay, here we go, checked in ! Right now the tension is at its height ... We can see how Mr. Garza holds the suitcase with the ransom, and faces the kidnapper who as we can see, hold a weapon! hold a weapon! You say the same thing as what we see, go point the camera! I hope there is everything I swear to God. Son of a bitch! I told you to come alone. Now fuck you, asshole! Hey Ricardo, you can get up It's finish ! They killed him? He fainted. Ricardo fucking, it's not you who did Warry Porter, Hussein, Gaddafi all this mess? This is not the same, There they respect the journalists, not like here. Tonio, check the material and tell Ramon to approach the car, I'm going to see Mr. Garza. Son of whores! Junkies of shit. Madam Chole! Madam Chole! Putain de vieille conne... You saw Juanita, I was the only one who was moving forward. I almost had to finish the report alone. If I did not leave quickly I would have received a bullet. My little ones! Ricardo, the microphone. - Mom ! - My love ! Calm down ! Go ahead We are in the house of the Garza family, where we live a historical moment. - Luc?a, Salvador, that they are ... - Leave us alone ... - Salvador, how do you feel ...? - Get out!

Luc?a, Luc?a. -Leave us in peace. - Get out. Remember that you have signed a contract! But damn, it's total shit. I'm sorry, Don Carlos. But you know better those things than me. Imagine how the governor would be affected if we lock up the parents. And people will lynch us! I do not care, these idiots signed an exclusive contract I gave them $ 1 million. If you want, you can complain but I doubt that it works. It will be difficult to recover your money. No, it's against you that I should complain. I told you to warn me! Yes, Mr Carlos, but I already have you says that my men received an anonymous call saying where were the girls, they did not even warn me. The police found them in an abandoned park and they brought them back to the station. And by cross-checking the information we found the place where they have been removed. Shit ! A week with a ratings crazy and we do not have the final. So Carlos, What do we do ? Patience, partner this time the scenario failed, we will see what they think Mexico You said what ? In a few words, we are screwed up. No, after that. What did you say ? That we missed the final of the tele-novela? No, we can still find a way. This will only end when I will decide it. 24 hours in 30 minutes Special edition Javier, we are in a place known as from San Juan El Baro. In front of us is the place where the binoculars Garza are sequestered.

Slowly we are getting closer, to observe the facts and gestures of these anonymous heroes who risk their lives for our safety. We will take a stand, and we move forward. Let's go ! It seems that the kidnappers saw us and opened fire. The authorities control the situation and continue to advance, in the middle of the crossfire, he reigns in the air A memory of the transmitted scenes from the Middle-East about two months ago.

But our desire to inform is more important, then we will continue. Come on, let's move on! Come ! Garza Binoculars Rescue Please, take care to the images that we'll present you. We found the bodies kidnappers who lost their lives resistant to the police. But it seems that the kidnapping was not the only activity illegal of these offenders.
