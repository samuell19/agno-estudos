Hey, inform him that you've left. Can I go and light a candle at the chapel? Do you want to go now? Just come with me. Or you would miss the bus! Call him once more. Hello, I've left. Did you leave? It's raining heavily. I can't hear anything. I'll call you once I reach. Do call me. -I'll call you. -Please close that door. Where do you want to go? Ticket. Where? Tell me when we reach Thamarassery. I'm not familiar with these places, son. Tell me when we reach Thamarassery. I'm new on this route. Hey, girl! -Where do you want to go? -One ticket to Kozhikode. -What? -A ticket to Kozhikode. -Don't you have change? -No. Bro, when will we reach there? When will we reach? I have no idea since it is raining heavily. Here. What about the balance money? I'll give it to you when you get down. It conked off. Damn it! I am on a new route from today onwards. It's raining heavily. Yeah, I am in Wayanad. I can't hear anything. I'll call you later. Dear, the water is coming inside. -Pull down that shutter. -Okay. Hasn't it been four days since I posted that? Sir, whenever I rush here and open this box, the only thing I find here is your love letter. Why don't you just give it to me directly? Why do you have to put it in the box? Then label it as a "donation box", so that no one puts letters in it. That teacher must be bored of reading these letters. -Why don't you buy a mobile phone? -Exactly. -Aren't you going for classes now? -Yes. Then, please go. Keep it carefully. Oh, God! Remove the suitcase carefully. Here. My slippers are torn. Take it off. What will people think? Removing your slippers is better than limping. Hold this for a second. -Give it to me. -Hey! Now we don't have to go to the town for shopping. Benny is opening a new textile shop. Right. Let it open. And just like that, I wish a textile shop, a movie theater, beauty shop, a park, a beach and everything else should be built. -Beach? -Oh, sorry. I said that out of excitement. That's what I was thinking. And that's how our area will also become a town. -Yeah, right! -Shall we scare the priest? -No. -Praise to the Lord! The brake doesn't work properly. Please move aside. -I'm tired of this. -What? I'm just tired of sitting at home. Right. Why don't we study something? Great. Didn't we decide to do nothing just because we got tired of studying? That's true. Do you have any ideas? You can go there and I will take this path. Great idea. Okay, bye. Come back soon. There's some work to do. Yes. I'll come. Isn't this done yet, Dad? -Why do you want it to be done? -I shouldn't have asked. Why are you so late? The jeep left by the time I finished shopping. Why did you throw it on my drawing? -Give it back. -Let it be. -Did you get what I asked for? -No. -Did you forget? -No, I couldn't find it. Isn't this done yet? Here. I had to search a lot to get this color. Take a look! I have got the pins as well. -I've kept it here. -Okay. This will be fine. -Is it the same color or not? -Almost. You'll never be satisfied! Get it yourself the next time. Why are you so late? I lost all the time looking for that cloth. I had noted the measurements for Usha's blouse. Did you see it? I don't know. Didn't you write it in the book? Are you sure? I couldn't find it in the book. I wrote it on a piece of paper. Not this one. This is Anju's measurements. Please call Usha and ask. She needs it by day after tomorrow. -What's her number? -It's written on the calendar. USHA. Miss Usha, I am Jessy speaking. We can't find the measurements of your blouse. Hello, who is this? This is Miss Usha's number, right? Who? Miss Usha. Who are you talking about? Sorry, it's a wrong number. Oh, no! The number got disconnected. 99... 610... 465. Damn it! Is that Miss Usha? The number you have called is currently busy. The arm? I'll tell her. She will send a blouse for the measurements. The neck should be deep and the arm length should be increased. So, she's not sending a blouse with those measurements? This is the problem with these people. No matter how well you stitch it, they won't stop complaining. And if you ever run into them, they keep complaining. "This is deep, that is short!" People love complaining! Did you get the measurements? Sorry, it was a wrong number. I dialed six instead of five. Sorry. That's okay. Which is this place? Place? End of the world! Get down, Mr. Murali! Will you be there in the evening? I'll call you and let you know. Keep this as well. Lalu, please drop her home. What about me? I'll see you in the evening. Vijay, don't keep repeating yourself. I'm not repeating myself, Suni. I'm not blaming you for wearing it. I can't bear its stench! This is the stench of sweat, buddy. The uniform of hard workers might stink. Suni, I think you should stay mum. Didn't you go to play football wearing this? If it was Messi's jersey, you would love it! I would! Messi has my respect. -You keep this! -Hey! Hey! Why are you always fighting, buddies? Nawaz, I was asking him. Couldn't he have washed this? He hasn't washed his own uniform in a long time. Now I understood one thing. -I can't even ask my friends for a favor. -Did you hear him? Now I'm at fault for helping him! Stop it, Biju. This can be solved over a tea. Come on. I just keep losing money buying tea for you guys. Yes! Come, let's have a tea. You carry on. I'll join you. Learn from him, buddies. He works day and night. No hassles! He knows more people here in six months than we do after thirty years. Don't sing. Come and have tea. Tea is not enough. Buy lunch for us! That's what you wish for. -Appu, tea for three people. -I'll give you. Not three. Make it four! -Make it four! -Now that's right. -Hey! Hey! Stop! Stop! -What is it? Give me 200 rupees. I only have some 150 rupees, Shiva. I don't have anything else. You're troubling me early in the morning. Don't create a scene on the road. Give me what you have. It's started! Can't you understand that I don't have enough money? Don't make me mad in front of all these people! He deserves a couple of slaps. If you wish to do it, then give him a tight slap! That will teach him a lesson. You're the right person to slap him. Nawaz, this problem cannot be solved that easily. If someone needs a beating, you shouldn't think much before it. You'll drink alcohol with this money. I have enough to buy diesel. -I'm not going to give this! -You're lying! -I need to buy diesel. Leave me! -Nonsense! Shut up! Stop, son. Let's go! I'm going to buy medicines. Get lost! Damn it! -Shall we go? -Please get into that auto rickshaw. Vishnu, pass a ride to us as well. She's a poor thing. He took all her money. I felt bad for her. Even we are like her. Then I'll move aside. I'll take whatever is left after you all go for rides. -That will be awesome. -I was just joking! Hey! -Nawaz! -Hey, Kunjippa! -Look who's here! When did you reach? -I came a while back. Really? Won't you come back later? We should have a blast. -We'll sort everything. -See you later. Don't stop anywhere again. My family is calling me. Let's go! Yes, I'm coming in ten minutes. -Why didn't you go to the airport? -Missed it. Hey, didn't you tell me that you will call me once you get ready? He gets all his passengers through his phone. Sister! The fashion of change! Benny Textiles welcomes you. The textile wonder in Poovaran Hill. Please pay attention. Sister! Sister, there's a call for you. Didn't I tell you to stick it like that? The call got disconnected. Here you go. -Why did you bring it? -Is that my fault? Let's take a look. Did you draw this? It's good! She's been working on it for a week. But did you buy the new paper I asked you to? Get lost. This guy's such a pain! I wish I hadn't dialed that wrong number! -Who is it? -No one. -You kept it there? -Everyone is here? -Darling! Come on in! -Is the alcohol over? This is Vishnu. -He is our friend. -Take a seat, bro. -No, you sit. -When are you leaving? Don't ask me such silly questions. You know about my leave, right? -Did your bring what I asked for? -It's all there, Murali. Let me open the suitcase. We have someone to pay the club's rent now. What else do you want? Just play already! Let me play. Just keep quiet. Murali, finish it in one go. Nawaz, give it a knock. -Should I? -Yes. I have been knocking for a while now. Will you hit this one at least? -There's a white one right next to it. -I'm playing black, right? -I know that. -But, isn't everything black for you? Just play! Game over. -Keep playing like that. -Awesome! Laugh as much as you want. It's us who lost. Pay for the tea and leave now. We lost? That's not possible. That's what happened. You should understand. Even those with eyes can't play properly. And you're trying to show off? Want to lose again? Shut up. I'm done losing. -Sunil, just sit here. I'll be right back. -Me? Wait a minute. I'll show you how it's done. Now you're going to face a tough round. Was it not tough enough until now? We only took a few pictures. Just check your WhatsApp. There are pictures of the cake cutting and the new dress. It's still raw, girl. You're complaining, right? Yeah, right. I have better things to do! My son is working hard in the Gulf. Lower your voice. All girls are the same. Yeah, right! Ask him about my phone. Nothing. She was asking when you're coming. Oh! You changed the whole statement. I'll tell him myself. -Isn't that the answer? -No. -So, no one got the answer yet? -No. It's been quite a while. This is not done. Pick up your phone, sister. Take it. Take it with both your hands. Sister, I want one as well. It's quite late. Really? I'm that... In the morning... Sir, I told you that I dialed your number by mistake. Don't disturb me. I understand. One... One second. Let us try to solve it. Nothing. Ask the question. -What world are you in? -Get lost. You ask. Who becomes bigger by standing upside down? Me! I told you to hit the red coin first. You lost six points! You also got a chance. Why didn't you do it? -Enough. You can't think for so long. -Wait. Let me think. It's an easy question. -Do you have a clue? -No clues for this. This doesn't require any clues. -Do you know the answer? -Yes, I do. -You say it. -It's a difficult question. It's very easy. You say it. It's simple. You will be shocked to know the answer. -The answer is six, right? -What? -Six, right? -Yes. -It's six. -That's right. -I said that earlier. -No, you didn't. No, I said it, but she didn't agree. No one answered here. Only Jessy did. So, six points in total for Jessy. Which man can't live inside the house? -Which man can't live inside the house? -I don't know. Who can't live inside the house? -Hey, that's my money. -Okay. Ring the bell. Tea is ready. -Nawaz. -Mr. Murali. Which man can't live inside the house? -What? -Who can't live inside the house? I can't live in my wife's house! I didn't stay there even for a single day after my wedding. There were bed bugs! Bed bugs are your brothers-in-law, right? A man who can't stay inside the house... Did you give one to him? Here you go. Do you know? Isn't it a snowman? Hey. Snowman. Tell me. Which man can't live inside the house? -Think about it. -Isn't it a snowman? Yes, it's a snowman! -Am I right? -Yes. You've become intelligent. -Didn't you shower today? -I didn't get time. -Uncouth female! -Hey! Hey! Shut up, you girls! God! They are kids, right? Let them play. Nonsense! Kids! -Shall I ask you a question? -Go ahead. -He's drunk. -You shut up. Bring it on. The mustard seed has an eye. There is a fly inside that eye! Do you know the answer? -Do you know? -I warned you that you'll be stuck. -The mustard seed? -Has an eye. There's a fly inside that eye. -What? -We're stuck. Say it! I was asking simple questions. We're in a trouble! I'll show you how to end the game in one strike. Watch. Murali, move your hand! I'm going to hit it. Biju, the game is over. Pay for the tea. Nawaz, the mustard seed has an eye. There's a fly inside that eye. What? You play. This is not the PSC test. This is some other level stuff. Do you know, Mr. Murali? Sir. The mustard seed has an eye. There's a fly inside that eye. The mustard seed has an eye. The mustard seed has an eye. There's a fly inside that eye. Isn't it rosary pea? Do you know the answer? -The mustard seed has an eye -What is it? There's a fly inside that eye Get going, Vishnu. A fellow from Kadalundi, Made some banana chips Had a bowl of toddy, And relished the fish fry He's coming, after buying a set Of spectacles from the market To see the love of his life, who has Kohl lined eyes and a beautiful smile Here I come To listen to the sweet stories Slipping in the murk, With waves of the lake in his eyes He is bringing black tea, Crossing the shores The story is a bit different Yes! We lost because of your one move! Game over. I'm leaving. There is no problem Murali, let's leave. Keep the coins back. -Switch off the lights. -They are off, Murali. Get lost! You'll come to me to pay the power bill, right? Just pay for this month as well. Kunjippa will pay the next month. Where is he? Just try calling him. What's the time? No. He's coming. Stop. Why are you so late, Father? It was at 10:00 a.m. It's all right, Saramma. The rituals were already done, right? -That's okay. -Right. -Praise the Lord, Father. -Praise the Lord! Go inside. Where are you going? -Inside. -Move aside! -Jesus! -Hey. -Shall we start? -Yes, Father. -Saramma! -Make it quick, Father. Where is Benny? Band! -It's done. -Come inside, Father. Please go inside. Please! -How is it? -Very nice. Move aside. -Father, have some sweets. -All of you, have a look. Though it's a small shop, it looks good. Not bad. -All of you should have it. -Check this out. Give them what they want. Have a look and take what you want. Everyone, come and have a look. -I'm leaving. -Okay, Father. -Are you leaving, Father? -I'm in a hurry. -Take some photos of everyone. -Do you have another model of this one? That's good. Multicolored, right? -Isn't it nice? Isn't it good? -Didn't you see this? I like it. Yeah, not bad. Isn't it nice? Sir, come here. What is it? I told you about something. Please ask about it. Okay, I will do the needful. -Benny, how much for this? -300 rupees. -300 rupees? -It's all right if you don't have. Father? Father? 300 rupees. Here. Here. There's a discount of 100 rupees. It's my first sale. You will always be blessed by the Lord. He is a blessed man. It will be better if all of you cooperate as well. -He will do well. -Okay, bye. Sweets? Will the clothes lose color? Will the clothes lose color? Even if it loses some color, you will get to see a new color. Won't it be fun to keep changing colors? -Really? -Yes. Then the people will also keep changing colors. That will be more fun. Will the color change? Are you tired of walking? No! She's smart! -Isn't it quite costly? -No. If you compare it to the cost in town, then it's not much. It's still a bit expensive. Hello, who is this? I'm the guy who you called by mistake. I know! I know! The eye of an ant. Isn't that the answer? You have sent me around 30 stupid answers including this one. Then, do one thing. Give me a clue. I thought about it all night. Call me when you get the answer. Don't say that! Please. One clue! Okay, I'm hanging up. Malutty, if you don't walk, I won't take you anywhere. Oh! So, someone else is giving you all the answers? Shut up. Father will hear you. Tell me the truth. Who is it? -Father is looking at us. Keep quiet. -Tell me who it is. It's no one. Just keep quiet. Did you get the answer? Wait, Vishnu. Let me think. How can a teacher not know the answer? Bro, are you going for the classes? I'm going home. I study at home. If you concentrate in class, you can just study at home. -Stop here. -I will. Don't jump off. -Okay, thanks! -See you. -I have to go to the farm. -You carry on. -This girl... -Oh, God! Stop there! -Mom! -Hey! -Mom! Mom! -Stop running! -What is it? -Dad... -Dad? -Dad, don't hit me! -You'll get on random guys' cycles? -What's the matter? She comes from school riding on random guys' cycles. Really? Not random guys, mom. There was only one guy. -You! -Wait! When did this start? Tell me! This is the first time, Mom. Is this a guy who studies in your class? No. It's a boy who studies in tenth class in Carmel school. Am I sending you to school to get on random guys' cycles? I got on it because my legs were hurting. I've been asking you to buy me a cycle for so long! Hey! I need to tell you something. It's better to buy a cycle for Jenny. I was thinking about it. The other one wants a touchscreen phone. Touchscreen phone? The phone with a camera in it. -Why does she need a phone with a camera? -I don't know. She has one that we can call her on, right? You ask her yourself. Well, when are you plucking the pepper? What do you want now? I don't want anything. Will you pluck the pepper only if I want something? My dad will give me what I need. You don't need to give me anything. You take care of your kids. Maybe because you saw it in the dark. It's very nice. I liked the blue churidar. That's the one I liked. I can change it only when I get the next ride to town. Keep the bill with you. -Oh, no! -Pull over. I had told you to wear your uniform while driving. Where are you coming from at this time? We had gone to the town, to buy some clothes. We watched a movie after that and got late. They're my sisters, sir. -You have the papers, right? -Yes. You may go then. You got away because we are with you. Did you see his stare? I got scared when he put his head inside. We shouldn't have eaten earlier. Now, I'm hungry. Why did you get so late? Don't you have a bathroom inside your house? Why do you have to make this place stink? That's my habit. Somethings should be left the way they are. -Sister! -What? -Come, I'll show you something. -What is it? Come, I'll tell you. Hey! Hey! Where are you going? We'll be right back, Dad. Where are you going, Jessy? -Come, I'll show you something. -What? I don't know. Come. Where are you running off to? She won't help out with anything at home. Lakshmi, where are you going? -Whom are you rushing to? -I'll be right back, Mom! Jenny, tell me what it is! It's not to be said. You have to see it. Come on! How much more do we have to run? Come with me! I lost my slippers! BENNY TEXTILES. Oh, God! TEXTILE WONDER IN POOVARAN HILL. BENNY TEXTILES. It's her photo. Wow! When did this happen? If they asked me for my photo, I would've given it. I didn't give this to them. They would've asked your father. -Nice, right? -Nice, right? Yeah, not bad. Come, let's go. This might fall during a strong wind. You're saying that out of jealousy. I'm not jealous! I only want the best for her. Come on. Come. -Neha didn't come, right? -No. Go ahead. This is your last chance. If you get it wrong again, I won't answer your calls. This is not Vishnu. It's his sister Revathi. Vishnu keeps talking about you. Give it to me. I am Reshma. Vishnu's elder sister. It's not what you think. I dialed his number by mistake. I know. You called for the measurements of the blouse. Jessy, your photo on the billboard looks great! -Why don't you pose for our shop as well. -Okay. Also, don't be angry with him. If you call him once in a while, he'll be very happy. I never call him. I know that you don't call him. I'm saying this only to see him happy. He rides the auto-rickshaw every day, for the two of us. Hey! Can you give me that phone? We'll call you later. Bye. Maybe I should call him. Did you dial again by mistake? No, I meant to call you, Vishnu. How do you know my name? Not just the name, I know everything. That's great. Where are you now? I'm at the hospital. Oh! What happened? You know everything, right? Why don't you know this? Your sister didn't say anything about this. So, that's how you figured things out. I didn't mean to tell you. Don't fight with your sister for that. They seem to really care about you. -One second, Jessy. -Just as we thought. -They've asked me to stay for two days. -Okay. Take that as well. -I didn't pay you! -That's okay. You can give it later. -Call me if you need anything. -Okay. So, tell me, Jessy. So, you run a free service? Sometimes. Listen, I'll call you later. -Are you going? -My mother is calling me. Don't go like that. I'll call you later. When will you call next? I can't say. -I'll call when I feel like it. -When will you feel like it? I have no idea about that. Fine? Fine. -Okay, bye. -Bye. You are the stars of the night, Which shine in my eyes You are the spring season That blossom on this land Are you the rain that came alive, To spread all over my forehead? Are you the story that sprouted, Before the birds could say it? Are you the rivers, the paths, Or the new shores that the waves touch? Sister, what about this embroidery of the flower for the arm? I'm old for this. Are you sure? -Are you on WhatsApp? -My phone doesn't have WhatsApp. Buy a phone with a camera. It doesn't cost much now. Towards this side. Beautiful! Lakshmi, where is my phone? I've told you a hundred times not to play with my phone! The birds say... The birds give warmth to each other Oh, God! I am not on Facebook. -Well, why did you check Facebook now? -It's because... -I wanted to see you. -Do you want to see me? Yes, I want to. I want to see you in person. I'll see you in person. Are you sure? Vishnu, people are waiting! Carry on! I'm on a call! The unremovable color From your fingernails Why does it cost so much? It's like the butterflies in the rainfall The unremovable color From your fingernails Walk. Hey! -Does he call daily now? -Yes. He has a great voice! Yeah, right. Voice doesn't matter at all! -Tell me. -It's the church festival here. Really? -Can you come? -Of course. Will you come? What are you doing? Really? Stop it and get going. Go! Get going! It's okay. I'll stand. Okay. Like the flowers blossom On a new plant Just like the peacock spreads Its feathers During the first rain And when it is the time of the celebration The sky glitters with Uncountable stars and sparkles Varghese, wait a second. You are the stars of the night, Which shine in my eyes You are the spring season That blossom on this land Are you the rain that came alive, To spread all over my forehead? Are you the story that sprouted, Before the birds could say it? Are you the rivers, the paths, Or the new shores that the waves touch? Why don't we make Jessy a doctor? That would be great! But she failed in her 12th class. Really? How many subjects did she fail in? That... Wow! Brother! Can you please come? My mom is really ill. I need to take her to the hospital. Please come. Brother, please come. There's no one else to help. -What happened? -She fell down while watching TV. Mom, get up! Get up! Bro, please help. -Okay. -Mom! Mom, please get up. Mom, get up. Slowly. Be careful. Put that arm over your shoulder. Come. Be careful. -Which hospital? -Government hospital. -It's the other way round. -Yes. It's okay, Mom. I think it will be better if you let him decide if she has to be a doctor or not. We will go to her house to talk about the rest tomorrow. -Isn't that so, Benny? -Yes. Are you off to sleep? I'll call in the morning. Sorry. I got stuck with a hospital case. I was on my way there. Sorry. It's all right. What did you want to tell me? It's... it's nothing. Please don't say that. I didn't mean to. I'm still at the hospital. Okay. Everyone has their priorities, right? I am hanging up. Don't be mad at me. Tell me what it was about. I'll tell you in the morning. Then? Dad asked them to come and see me. Let them come, see you and go. It's our decision, at the end of the day, right? Don't be afraid. I'm not afraid. Then? I am tensed. Didn't they say they're coming in the afternoon? Martin just told me they'll be coming here in sometime. Move that machine away. Hey! They've reached. Really? Where? Hey! Go and call her. They've reached. Get ready quickly. -Come! -Why did he have to come now? -Really? -What am I supposed to do now? First of all, you need to calm down. Don't worry about anything. Call me once they leave. Please change this. Please come. Ma'am, come. Come inside. Come in, Martin. Please come. Don't remove your shoes. Sit down. Sit. I'll be right back. Come. Wait a minute. -Just a minute. -Okay. Had we known that they would come early, we could've prepared something. I didn't know they would rush in like this. Just serve them whatever you feel like. -Where is she? -She's inside. I'll call her. Okay, I'll call you. Okay. The groom is in a hurry. When he asked me if he could use her photo on the flex, and when he asked me if we should make her a doctor, you should've seen the excitement on his face! Is there something going on between the two of them? Even if they are in love, we don't need to tell anyone about it. I'm going there. Untie that knot. This wasn't necessary! Come, dear. Mother Mary! Give tea to mother. Mother? Give it to her. Tea. Have it. Have it. Ma'am, please drink the tea. I'll drink tea after I get home. -Mom! -Leave me. Varghese! There's some work in our field. You won't be able to do it alone. Call some more people. We dropped by to say that. Come. Why are you still sitting? Get up and come! Thank God! Why were they creating a scene? We wouldn't even keep our cattle in that house. We can forget about looks or education! Is that how it works? They don't even have the means to live! Do they, Martin? If you ask me... Try to find someone. Even if it's expensive. We have to win the cup this time. Where are you? I'll come there. What's all that noise? People are singing here at the club. By the way, that alliance got canceled. What is this? So happy for a failed alliance? Of course! My mom had already said that the guy's mother won't agree. I was still afraid. Fear? I wasn't scared. -Then? -I don't know. Then? You keep talking about a chapel at Kozhikode, right? I offered to light 101 candles there. Who is it, Jessy? No one. God! I almost got caught! Why are you silent? I was thinking. What? Well... If your photo has come on a textile shop's flex board... you must be really beautiful, right? I'm not beautiful. I have squint eyes, uneven teeth and a limp. Why? Is there a problem? -Did you run away? -No. Why aren't you saying anything? Well... I stay in the quarters... and work hard day and night. It might be really difficult for you to live with me. If you think about it, isn't Benny better for you? Vishnu, don't get me talking! I didn't like you because of your wealth or appearance. Then? I know you like me. I also like you. That's all. So, when are you coming to the chapel, to light the candles? You tell me. I can come anytime. So, call me when you reach Kozhikode. Not just the chapel. There are many other things to see there. Then... will you show me the sea? Why? Haven't you seen the sea? I saw it long back when I was in school. Oh, God! Don't mock me! I love the sea! -And me? -I told you that already, you idiot! Okay, I'm going. I have a ride. -Oh, no! So, won't you call again? -I'll call you at night. Give me a missed call before you sleep. Bye. Hey! -I'll hang up. -Okay. Oh, God! Father! Father! Say something. Didn't you like any other girl here? There's no one around like her. I want to marry her. Her father is also interested. Convincing your mother, Saramma is not so easy. -It's a problem. -Tell me how to solve it. That's what I'm also thinking. Do one thing. Don't be the Father of the Church, but talk to her as my father. Me? On behalf of your father? Come. Hold this. Benny, this wedding is not going to happen. Your father will not agree to anything that Saramma doesn't like. -Father! Don't... -Hey! If Philippose was alive, do you think he would say anything more than this? Moreover, he was so scared of Saramma. -What? -I mean, he was so much in love with her. Leave that. Now, I... According to Father Gabriel's opinion... No need, son. Forget it. We don't want anything Saramma doesn't like. She has a lot of expectations from you. -Poor thing. -Okay, Father. I'm leaving. -Hey! My knife! -Here. How old are you now? I'm quite old. What's the point? You're an adult now. You have the maturity and intelligence to choose your likes and dislikes. Go and tell your mother that you want her! If she doesn't agree even after that, do as you please! -Mom! Wait a minute. -What is it? -I have to tell you something. -What? No one is born with money in hand, right? You keep saying that my father built all this through his hard work. Did my poor father live enough to enjoy it? It wasn't just your father. I also worked hard. People like us who hang on to our wealth, often forget one thing. What is that? A great man was born in a cattle shed long back. So? Marriage is something that happens once in a lifetime. You should value love and care, and not wealth or money! She's gone. Martin. If the rich gives the poor, then a time will come when the poor will become rich. For that, another deluge needs to happen. Won't your mother get scared if you talk like this? This is a time when the poor don't bother what the rich people give to them. Go and tell your mother what you want. I'm willing to marry Varghese's daughter, Jessy! Even if someone opposes me, I will marry her. Now that's called courage. Will you get married without my permission? If I have to, I will. -Will you? -Don't push me down. After making all this wealth, my father departed. Looks like he's gone crazy. If he was alive, he would have agreed. -Sister. -To hell with him! Let him be ruined. Do whatever you want! Don't talk like that, sister. What about Saramma? I told you, right? Saramma agreed to it. Inform all your relatives at the earliest. This Sunday, we'll have the engagement. That's what he said. Oh, God! What are you thinking? There's no time now. I always knew that Saramma would agree. Right? -Have some more tapioca. -That's enough! I can be back for food, right? Let me wash my hands. You're here. Everything got sorted so quickly. They're saying that the engagement should happen on the coming Sunday. Aren't you happy? Hold this. I'll come now. I'm leaving. We shouldn't delay anything now. Then, tell your parents about Vishnu. Why can't you tell them? How can I say that without even seeing him once? What can we do now? I don't know. Jump out, kids. Hold this! -Run! -Hello? Tell me, Jessy. Take it! Why aren't you saying anything? What happened? They came again. The engagement has been fixed. They didn't even ask me. No one wants to know my choice. Don't worry. How can I not be worried? Vishnu, I'm serious. I must meet you. Enough of the romancing over the phone. If you want to meet me... where will we meet? Will you come here? I can come there. But won't it be a problem if someone sees us? Then tell me, Vishnu. Where can we meet? I just want to see you. Well... All of a sudden... Why are you talking like this, Vishnu? Everything happened all of a sudden, right? Calm down. I don't know what to do. Let me think and find out a solution to this. Things will happen just like we dreamt and wished, Jessy. I'll think about it and call you back. Till then you shouldn't worry, and be a good girl. Okay. Shall I hang up? Okay. -Where are you going? -I'm going to the chapel. -Come back soon. -Okay. Why are you still hanging on to that, Jessy? You're crazy! Yes. I am crazy. You know what? I don't sleep without listening to his voice. Do as you please! If we go now, we can come back tomorrow. I've called Babu and arranged the tickets. I don't think we can go everywhere. It's okay. We can call the others for the wedding. Finally, they'll complain that they won't come to the wedding, since they weren't invited for the engagement. A phone call should do, actually. Some people won't come if we invite them over the phone. But we should invite everyone. Let them all come and see. -There are many jealous people. -That's true. Especially your relatives. -Did you say something? -Nothing. Let's leave quickly. -Mom, will we come back tomorrow? -Of course. -Where is she? -She's not coming. What do you mean? Jessy! Are you not coming? What do you mean? I'm not coming, Dad. I'm not feeling well. You carry on. I don't want to travel so much. Will you stay here alone? She must not be well. Then let Jenny stay with her. -She can go to school. -No! I want to come! I want to see Chinnu and Puppy. -I rarely get to see them. -I'll stay with Lakshmi. It's okay. -Then it's fine. Let's go. -Come on. We have to go in person, right? Let her go there or Lakshmi can come here. Okay. Come on, walk. Hold this. Had we told Benny, he would've hired a car for us. -You should've told him. -Yeah, right! If we had told him, he would have brought his quota here. -What? -Walk! He hasn't even got engaged to her and you're already demanding things. -I haven't told him. -Did you cook something? No. Lakshmi is here. I'll call you later. Come. Is that enough? This is all I've brought now. Please adjust! -Do you want pickle? -No. I'm going to Kozhikode tomorrow. Kozhikode? Why? Did he say he'll come there? Jessy, why didn't you tell me earlier? What will I tell my mother? Did you sleep? No, I was just about to. I don't think I will be able to sleep. Hey! I will leave at 6:00 a.m. Don't be late. -At the bus stand, right? -Bus stand! Yes. -You wait there. -Okay, I will wait there. -Come and sleep. It is quite late. -Wait. -You have to leave in the morning! -I'm coming. I'll call you when I'm leaving. Yeah, call me in the morning. I know when the bus would reach. -I'll be there. -Okay. She's up all night talking to the guy she's going to meet in the morning! Jessy, are you going to sleep or not? Didn't you shower today as well? At least today, you should've showered. It's so cold. Don't you have anything else to ask? Wake me up at 5:00 a.m. It's almost 5:00 a.m. Please go to sleep. Oh, God! -Give me the keys. -Here. Call him and tell him that you're leaving. -Hello, I can't hear you, I'm driving. -Hello, I've left. Have you left? It's raining heavily. I can't hear you. I'll call you when I reach. I'll call you back. -Call me when you reach there. -I will. You must call. I will. Close that door, please. We're in Kozhikode. Please get down everyone. Get down! Get down! Get down quickly. Hey, girl! Don't you want the change? -Where did you board the bus from? -Poovaran Hills. Okay. Don't go. It's raining. There will be a traffic block. Turn it around. I'm coming. Buy this book. It's is only for 30 rupees. -It's raining cats and dogs in Wayanad. -Really? Yes. Where do you want to go? Where do you want to go? -Where were you yesterday? -I was on leave. LADIES WASHROOM. Pay and go, dear. Once they are done, everyone says they don't have change. Everyone, get down. We've reached the destination. We've reached. Move aside! Let me take that phone! Leave me! Let me take that phone! What? -My phone is switched off. -Get going. -Okay! -Get lost. VALIYERI MEDICAL SHOP. Hey! Buy two! Bro, two bottles of water. Get me chilled bottles. Make it quick. Here's the water. Don't you have cold water? Give me really chilled water. You're cheating people by naming your shop a "cool bar"? That's all I have. There has been no power since yesterday morning. Why don't you close your shop? I'll decide whether I should close my shop or not. Take them if you want. Then, lock all this up! -You're cheating people. -Nonsense! Don't create a problem here. -What will you do? -Get lost! -I won't consider that you are older. -That's all right! Shibu, get it from under the seat. No, dude. To hell with him and his shop! You! What? Start the car! Come out! I'll not spare you! This is not our town. Why did you have to mess up? POLICE. -What's the problem? -Tell him about it. -Nothing sir. -What? There isn't a problem, sir. -Are you sure? -Yes, sir. -Okay, let's go. -Everything is fine, sir. What did you do, Roy? -What? -That guy broke three to four bottles. -But, what about you? -Hold this! Hey! I'm also coming! Let's go! We should have our people on the next committee. Only then it will be right. -What's up? -Nothing. What's up? Do you have any stuff with you? No, man! -I have cigarettes. -That's fine. I have a matchbox. Come on! Come and place your bets. Don't think a lot. This is the time to check your luck. If you lose, I will get all the money. If you're scared, then no need to play! Come on. Place the bet on this one. Play carefully, man! -Play carefully. -Give me 50 rupees. -What? -50 rupees! I don't have money. -I only have 50 rupees. Play carefully. -I'll give it when I win it! Should I place it on the club or the spade? -Place it on clubs, dude. -No. I'll place it on spade. Place it on clubs! I came for the festival because you asked me to, right? Why aren't you talking to me now? My mother is here! Couldn't you message me that? People are watching! Since when do you not like me? Tell me! Leave me. That's good for you. Hey! Wait! Not that way! We've to go there. Santosh! Santosh! Place your bets! If it's blank, company gets the money. -If it is blank-- -Yes! Double! -Give it. -I lost all my money. Take it! Take it! Come on. Here you go. Anyone can place their bets! Play! Stop! Stop! Hey! Stop! Stop right there! Dude, the police are here. The police is here! You owe me ten rupees. I've already given it! -Run! Run! -Stop there! Give me 500 rupees. -What? -Don't you remember? It's my money. -What is this? -These guys were gambling, sir. I will not spare them. You get going! Go! What are you looking at? Go home! Hey! Hey, Roy! Get up, man! Seems like you got wasted yesterday. Didn't you go home? When did you come here? Hey! -Didn't you go home yesterday? -No. I didn't see you at the festival yesterday. She's alone with the kids, right? I went home early. Can you lend me 2,000 rupees? No. What about 1,000? I don't have anything since I already paid the fees for the children. It's okay. Shall I leave? Can you at least give me 500 rupees? I'll give you if I get something by evening. Shall I leave? Oh, God! Why is his face like that? What's up? Don't hit me! You're here. Where were you yesterday? Roy! Why don't you go home on time? I know you won't like it. But that girl is getting marriage proposals now. The people who are coming will ask about the men of the house. It will be good if you don't forget that. It's difficult to get jobs these days as per your qualifications. Does that mean you'll keep wandering around? You should do whatever job you get, and do it diligently. Aren't you going? Why is she irritating me? Where did you get her from? Who? My mother? Didn't you get any money from gambling yesterday? Tell me the truth. Didn't you get the money? I got 500 rupees. -And? -I gave 300 rupees to my mother. -I have 200 rupees left. -This won't be enough for me. I'll keep it. I'm leaving, Mom! -You're going home, right? -What's the point of going home? -Then, drop me at the market. -Come. Roy, what are your plans? There's a job. I can earn around 1,50,000 rupees in a month. I just have to work for two days. -1,50,000 rupees per month? -Yes. What job is this? Snatching? Oh, God! IN REMEMBRANCE OF COMRADE, E.K. NAYANAR. Dear, the bus is here. Come fast. Get in quickly. Come on! Let's go! Should I take a leave? Shut up and go for work! Subair! Please stop. Stop. I'll stop. Don't stop in front of the bus. Stop, bro. Please get down, sister. Don't ruin our trip. Come fast. Stop prancing around, and come! What are you doing? Come, hop on! Haven't I told you not to behave like a goon in front of people? -Did they get you married? -It's quite embarrassing. Did they? I didn't see you at the bus stop. Were you trying to escape? I called you so many times in the morning. I called you back. Why didn't you pick up? Leave that. What about that thing I said? Where will I get money from, in the middle of training? If I ask my dad, it will take two days. If I tell him it's for you, then I won't get it at all. To hell with you and your dad! Give me 100 rupees for petrol. I would have taken the bus, right? -You're such a pain! -Yes, too much! I don't think this will work out, Roy. Find someone who has a job. That would be better. There's no point talking to you. I'm going. Don't go! People are watching! What are you doing, Roy? -What? -What? -Leave my hand. -Your fingers have become fat. I have an interview at Kozhikode. You can forget about this. You can mortgage it but don't sell it. I'll think about it. -Let's go? -I am short of 200 rupees. 200 rupees? That's all right. When people buy something, the amount increases. And when they sell it, the amount decreases. Especially for gold. Hold this. Give it to me. Wait. Let me finish this. Can't you see? Get down, man. -You get down. -Is it okay? Make me a drink. There's no water. So, I've to take care of the electricity and water. And you'll take care of the beverages. Understood, right? After two drinks, you become a different person. -Would he be here? -He should be here. He'll be here. Riyaz! Is Roy inside? -He's there. -Why don't you come for the meetings? When are you going? I have to go in the morning. I forgot. Hey, Krishna! -Krishna, do you want one? -No. I don't booze. When did you stop? How does it matter to him? Yes. -Come here. -Tell me. I need to tell you something. Come. Go. Don't upset the party members. What is it, bro? This is Pradeepan. You know, right? There's a small problem. It's something we can't avoid. You need to help me. He will get involved in all this. If we take too long, we'll get calls from everywhere and things will go out of control. I'll think about it. It's not a big deal. It's okay. You can do it after you come back. Krishna, after this is over... if you say that it's for the party and the movement... you'll see my true colors. This is our personal problem. Don't be afraid. They came to me because they are scared, right? And then they tell me to not be afraid. Don't worry about anything. We'll fix everything. Come. -Will it happen? -He has promised us. He will do it. You know him, right? Aren't you going for the interview tomorrow? Of course. Where are you now? I'm preparing for it. Wow! So, have you decided to reform? Got it. You're at the workshop, right? How many drinks did you have? You found out, right? Tell me. Did you tell your parents about your interview? Why did you call me now? I called to wish you. Good night! She called to wish me. You can go now. How's it going? -What happened? -Is it over? Yeah, I got the job! They told me to come collect my salary tomorrow. -Why are you talking like this, Roy? -Just hang up now! Is it your wife? No! It was my aunt! You can go in. How was it? Okay, right? WELCOME. You can wish me while entering. Nothing like that. I've done my best. The issue was with the year of course completion. I've talked and sorted it all out. You can message me in the evening. I'll tell you in detail. So, call me after joining. Okay. So, Roy... BBA graduates have nine job offers. Five of them are already finalized. The rest of them will be appointed at Chennai or Bangalore. You know, right? Everyone wants experienced candidates. The only problem is that you're a fresher. Sir, once I get the job, there will be no problem with the experience. That's true but... Places like these are meant for the freshers, right? Many people are waiting for this job itself. So, we need to compromise a little. If you can do that... If you want a job, you need to do some adjustments. Adjustments, right? Can you arrange 2,00,000 rupees? I'll get you the job. You give me 2,00,000 rupees. I'll give you something! DO YOU WANT TO WORK ABROAD? BRITE'S INDIA. Do you have a cigarette? I just have one. Want to share? Okay. -How was your interview? -These guys are fake. -Interview, it seems. -Did they ask you for money? If it was money, it was okay. Are we so desperate that we have to act as a pimp to get a job in our Kerala? No point talking about it. I wanted to slap that guy sitting inside. Did you? -Did you slap him? -No. -I didn't slap him. -You didn't? I don't have that habit. Shall I leave? Okay? 15 rupees! -Roy! -Riyaz, where are you? I'm working. -How was it? -Don't even ask! -Why? -They want girls apparently! I don't know what to say. It's a task to get a job. That's great! Since you don't have money, do one thing. Arrange a girl from somewhere. Get lost! These people just take advantage of people who work hard. Dude, people do much bigger frauds to get a job in today's times. Think about it and do something. Or wait. You know Abu, right? Call him. He does all sorts of things. Do you have his number? Yes, I have it. I'll call him. Or you come here. -I'll talk to the supervisor. -Riyaz! I think you are here to work! I don't pay you to be on your phone. Do your work! He keeps complaining all the time! -Catch him! -Catch him! Picking pockets, you rascal? Move! Let me take my phone! -Beat him! -Not that! My phone! Let me take that phone. Leave me! Bro, can you give me your phone to make a call? My phone fell here. I can't find it. Here? Just let it ring. It's switched off. Hello, Vishnu, it's me, Jessy. Where are you? I've been calling since so long. Hello? Haven't you reached yet? I'm in the toilet. Can you come here? What are you doing inside? Come out! Vishnu, can't you hear anything? Are you outside? Will you be able to identify me? I'm wearing a cream churidar and a red shawl. Say something, man. Shall I come out? Be on the phone. Don't hang up. Yes. Okay, fine. The bus that came from Wayanad in the morning-- It's at the end. I don't want to go. Is there someone who came on it? I work on that bus. What's the matter? Did a girl get on at Poovaran Hills? Must be around 18 to 20 years old. Is it the fair girl with curly hair? Yes. She got off here at Kozhikode. She got off here. She was standing next to me when I was having tea. Where? I saw her standing there. Did you check there? I did. Try calling her. I lost my phone when I got here. Here. -You can use my phone. -I don't have her number. You should at least remember the important numbers, right? -I'll try calling my phone. -Let's check there. Where are you? -I'm outside. -Are you wearing a pink shirt? Turn around! This side! Here! I got worried when you didn't pick up. -Can you buy me some water? -Do you want water? Come. It was engaged till sometime back. Now it's switched off. Someone else must have taken it. She was standing there a while ago. Come, let's check there. Once someone gets lost in the crowd, then you can never find them. -That's the problem. -Here's your phone. Was it here or there? What, bro? I think I was standing there. Do you remember what she was wearing? Not really. There she is! That one? -Shall I leave? -Thank you, bro. Here. I was going to tell you. You have mistaken me. I came to give you the phone. You're Vishnu, right? -Yes. You? -I found your phone. Make way! -When he picked up the phone, I thought... -That's okay. What happened? I got very scared when I couldn't get through. I was also really worried. -Shall we go somewhere else? -Let's go. The moment when the distance is over The blue sky is up there, far away An unseen seashore The mind is as deep as the sea Many days have gone by Many a tears have been shed Didn't it shower like waves? Waiting for the arrival of this day Adorned with the song That the waves sang, until now For this moment To continue just like this You just have to be By my side, hereafter The moment when the distance is over The blue sky is up there, far away An unseen seashore The mind is as deep as the sea Both fingers are like the flames As we walk through the streets, Lost in ourselves I like this place. This is a nice place. I'm coming inside for the first time. I've just dropped people here. It's quiet and peaceful here. It's like the place where you live, right? Maybe that's why I liked it. You said you'll show me the sea! Of course! The sea should be seen in the evening. That's when it looks great. You have to take me, okay? Sit closer. For this moment I just want to take a selfie. Come on! Okay. To continue just like this You just have to be Come. By my side, hereafter Isn't that the guy who gave us the phone? -Where? -Over there. -He has been following us for a while. -Really? I saw him earlier, but I didn't want to tell you. Why is he following us? -You wait here. -No! Don't go. -Let's go somewhere else. -Wherever we go, he follows us. Wait here. He's coming. You hang up. What's going on, dude? That's what I'm asking you. Why are you following us? -Is this the first time you're seeing her? -Why do you care? Why are you pushing me? Don't touch me. Don't think that you can bother us because you returned the phone. Really? -I told you not to push me! -Stop holding my hand! -Come to my town, you're... -This is everyone's town! How dare you touch me! Hey! Vishnu, stop! Listen to me! Stop it! -He started it! -Let's not get into this. I didn't do anything. Why is he following us? Hey! Come here, you asshole! Oh, God! Come on. -That guy hurt his head. -Get up. What's the problem? Hey! What's going on here? What's the problem? -They were fighting here. -He started it, sir. The other guy left. He pushed that girl into the water. He was trying to do moral policing, sir. We know how to handle things here. Where's your house? It's in Kannur, sir. -What are you doing here? -I had an interview. You should go home when your interview is over. Go! Go! Everyone can leave now! All of you, leave! Disperse! What are you waiting here for? Go! Why are you standing here? Leave, leave! Go! Go! Hello! Who's this? Tell me. Oh! How are you doing? When did you reach? When? And then? Where? Just wait there. I'll come in ten minutes. Why don't you take one of these? Is your hand wounded? -Show me. -It's okay. Show me this one. Is this okay? Okay? Give me this one. Give me a T-shirt in my size. Is this okay? Yeah, that's fine. -How much? -340 rupees. What happened? -Is that blood? -That's okay. -Start the bike. -Hop on! -They left. -Where did they go? I don't know where they went. -Can you recognize them? -Then hop on quickly. -Did they go this way? -That way. Are you hungry? Are you hungry? I was hungry but not anymore. I'll call you. What are you going to do, Roy? -Can you please hang up, Annie? -Roy, listen to me! Shall we have a couple of drinks? I won't leave without beating him up. Not that. Shall we have a couple of drinks? I can't let it go like that, Abu. They won't leave that soon, anyway. Move. We'll fix everything. Come. I'll go and wash my face. What? What? What happened? We came to freshen up, right? Yes. If you give me your shirt, I'll wash it. Okay. Bro, here's the water. -How are you? -I'm okay. Let me know if you need anything. I can't believe they got away. You should've given him a tight slap. People gathered by then. And the police turned up. Drink! Go and freshen up. I'll get some food for us. -Come back soon. -Yeah, I will. Lock the door! -Do you have cigarettes? -No, sir. There's a shop nearby. You'll get it there. I'll go buy some. -Come soon. -Let this be here. Lakshmi, tell me. Did you reach? I reached a while back. I called you so many times, Jessy! Why didn't you call me back? -Did you see him? -Yes, I did. -He's awesome. -Really? -Where is he? -He's just gone out. Why? Where are you? Me? I am... I'm at a lodge now. What? A lodge? What are you doing, Jessy? Have you gone crazy? You're getting me wrong. When we went to the park, my clothes got soiled. So, we came here so that I can change. -And then? -Okay. You'll reach by evening, right? -My mother is asking me about you. -I'll be there. -What did you tell her? -I told her you went to buy something. Hey! I'll call you later. Lakshmi, did you take my phone? -Are you Jessy? -Yes. Who are you? Where is he? Vishnu has gone out. I'll call him. What happened? I'll be there soon. Give me a minute. Bro, take me to Lissy Lodge. This way. Abu, come! Got him. Come on! -Get the phone and keys. -Here, take it. -Keep this. -I'll clear the bill later. -Go. Which way did he go? -This way. The name is Chinchu. The auto rickshaw's name is Chinchu. -When did you come? -It's been a while. -Really? -What did you do, Vishnu? -What happened? -What happened to your phone? What do I say? Didn't you guys talk? No. She didn't say anything. She is Saleena. She is really dear to me. She runs this lodge. She is smart! I know that your selection won't be bad. Well... aren't you both going to Mangalapuram today? Where? Please come with me. Just a second. -Come! -What is it? What is it? -Why did you come here? -Leave my hand! To meet you! -He had called me. -Lower your voice. He said that he couldn't get through. I tried calling you so many times. It was either switched off or out of coverage. Why didn't you talk anything after picking up the phone? And it's impossible that you won't visit this place. Ma'am, I can't take her to Mangalapuram now. I will do it later, in due course. Don't forget that you've borrowed money, Vishnu. I am good at my work. I will bring her. Call him and tell. Don't get me tensed. Call him quickly! I'll do it. Arrange another vehicle. There's no road there. Only stones and sand. -What do we do now? -There it goes. -Let's go. -Hop on! Let's go! -Let's go. -Oh, God. -That's the vehicle, right? -Yes. Bro, stop. -Stop the rickshaw. -What is it? CHINCHU. Where did you drop your last passenger? -I dropped him at Lissy lodge. -Okay. Abu, Lissy Lodge. -Got it. -Shall we go this way? -Why don't you go tomorrow? -Keep quiet. Send him the photos. Let him calm down. I'll send all that. Please leave now. Go! Hey! Don't do anything wrong with her. Get lost! She can't control her words. Didn't you have food? Why should we go to Mangalapuram? To Mangalapuram? Well... That wasn't decided. She must have said that thinking that she'll help us out. I had told her that we're meeting for the first time. I want to go. Drop me at the bus stand. Already? I have to go home, Vishnu. You didn't even have food. That's all right. -It's all right. -You can go after eating. No! -You can leave after eating. -I'm not hungry, Vishnu. -We can go after eating. -I just want to go home. -Leave me. -Sit there, Jessy. Sit down. You just want to go to the bus stand, right? Look at me! You just want to go to the bus stand, right? I'll take you to the bus stand. No, I... Just wait for some time, Jessy. We've waited for this moment. When can we... We will not get to be together. Vishnu, leave me. What? What's the problem? What is it? What happened? Leave me. -My hands are paining. -That's because you're defending, right? Your hands are paining because you're defending, right? Didn't I say that you can go after some time? Didn't I say that you can go after some time? Hey! We waited for so many days, right? Jessy, listen to me. Listen to me. Move. Leave me. Why are you getting scared? -Why are you getting scared? -I just wanted to see you. But that's not enough for me. Leave me. It's not a problem. We can... Don't be scared, Jessy. We can go. Isn't it starting? Is the petrol over? Let's ask there. Hey! Where is this Lissy lodge? -Over there. -Come, I know the place. Not a soul is here. There! Come on! Jessy, why are you crying? -Why are you crying? -Leave me. Leave me, Vishnu. Leave me! Hey! Tell me! Which room is it? Which room is it? -Which room? -Over there. Get lost. Don't scream! I am warning you. Why are you here? Roy, you can do whatever you want to. Then let's go. Where is she? Where is she? Tell me! Where is she? -Why do you care where she is? She's not your sister, right? -Where are you hiding her? -I will not tell you! They pulled me and hit me on my face! Who are you guys? I am Abu. Roy is inside. I don't know the other guy's name. What's happening in there? I heard them scream. Who let him inside? -Why are you shouting? Shut up and go. -This can't happen here. -I know what to do with you guys. -What will you do? Whom are you calling? Call whoever you want to. There is not a single person in Kozhikode whom I don't know. -This cannot happen here. -Call! Go ahead! What is it? Call the police. That's better. Aren't you calling? My dear, this is just a small fight. We'll leave now. We'll finish this and leave now. You can go! Get going! -Get lost! -Okay. Where is she? Where is she? Tell me! Tell me! Where is she? Where is she? Open it. Open the door. You will be safe. Open the door. Don't be scared. Open the door. Open the door, Jessy. Hey! Hey! Abu! Hey! Open it. Jessy, open the door. I'm going to kick it open. Come. No! Don't be scared. I'll drop you. Come. You are safe with me. Listen to me. Come! Come! Don't be afraid. Come. Come with me. You carry on. I'll handle him. Don't go. You got some calls. Okay. Hello, Satheesh? Come with your car. We need to go to a place. Hello, Nawaz. Tell me, bro! Vishnu, you left in the morning, right? Where are you? I am at Kozhikode. Where are you? He is in Kozhikode, sir. Ask him when he'll reach. When will you reach? Give it to me. Sir, it got disconnected. -Since how long has he been here? -It's been five to eight months, sir. I always had a doubt that they were not his sisters. -Sir. -Yes. He had asked me once if I was interested in doing night trips. -Don't say all that. -Okay. -Both are criminals. -Will we have to go? Sir. She is with me. I'll put her on. Yeah. Do that. Here. It's Annie. I am Annie. Roy's cousin. Are you okay, Jessy? Such things keep happening. Unexpected things would happen. We might take time to identify the right people. I was sure that Roy will be able to help you. And it was me who asked him not to complain to the police. Why should we let people know? So, tell me. What's the next plan? Why aren't you saying anything? Don't be sad. No one knows this now. That itself is a big deal. Forget everything that happened today, and get home quickly. Can you put Roy on? Hey! Ask her if she had food. Okay? I'll ask. Hang up and get lost. -Don't hang up. I need to say something. -What? Give some water to that Bruce Lee. -Annie. -Yes. Get me some water. Do you want to have some food? Do you have money for the bus fare? Will you show me the sea? Why not! Let's go. Hey! Show them the new items. Yes! Check this out. Two new designs are done. I'll send them on WhatsApp once I get home. Here. Okay! Everyone is curious. You didn't say anything yet. I'll let you know. Let's wait for the right time. I'll be around. Bye.
