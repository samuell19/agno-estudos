Some stories are unique. Stories about fate, that make ordinary people seem extraordinary. This is the story of one such extraordinary person. And I've had the honor to be a minuscule part of his saga. This story is about… Hello! I am Gangaram. The Sarpanch of Jhundao. My village is in Gutipur. Though the people of Gutipur claim it's in Majhiala. And the people of Majhiala claim it's in Gutipur. - It can barely be spotted on the map. - Hold on. Get to the point. You're the Sarpanch, right? - Yes. - Please get to the point. - It's nearly lunchtime. - Of course. You see, the government has a scheme for us, the poor. That's what I am here for. Please give it to me. There's no such scheme right now. Please don't do this. You're disappointing me. I'm the Sarpanch, the head of my village! They are waiting for me to return with some scheme. I've come to you with high hopes. Please don't disappoint me. Do you think this is a charity? I can't just hand you a free scheme and send you away. Look, sir, our village Jhundao is right beside the jungle. Wild animals… like boars, deer, nilgais, elephants, and many more… They are destroying our farmlands. The villagers are dying of starvation. Mr. Mishra, what do we do about this? Alright, apply for the Prime Minister's Relief Fund. - Go there. - Thanks a lot, sir. - I'm really grateful. - It's okay. Just tell me one more thing. - Where's the Prime Minister's office? - What? What an impossibly innocent man! - Mister, who made you the Sarpanch? - The villagers. Well, they've made a mistake. The thing is… India is now… Let me explain. India is getting digitized now. - Digital! - What? It means all the work is now gonna happen online. Sir, I've waited in line many times! But no one bothers listening... - Please... - I'm telling you the truth! I'm not talking about that line. Do you know about the internet? World wide web, you understand? Well, I do know about fishnets and cobwebs. And the web of deceit! - These are the only webs we know of... - You see that? The wires? - Wires coming out of the white box? - Yes. Anyway, forget about it. I have a solution. Bring me a certificate from the Forest Department. It should mention that the animals of the Forest Department, come to your village and eat up your crops. - Yes, they do! - They eat it and they destroy it. Right? So, bring me the certificate. And what will I do with it? I'll take the certificate and make a file on my computer. And where will I send that file? I'll send it to the Block. And where will the Block upload it to? - To the DM's office. - Okay. From the DM's office, the data will go to the Commissioner. From the Commissioner's office, it'll be scanned and sent to the Secretariat. And where will all the data from the Secretariat go? Delhi. At Delhi, they'll make two copies. One file will go to the Chief Minister's Relief Fund. The other will go to the Prime Minister's Relief Fund. Done! Your internet seems to be a very complicated web! Did you really think being a leader was that easy? The leader must make sacrifices. And I'll do that! I will! No, I'm asking you to sacrifice your life! You're not getting it. Fine, just bring the certificate. It will be done. - Alright? - How many more certificates should I get? How many?! My villagers are starving to death. They are committing suicide. - But you... - No, wait! One second. - Yes? - You are wrong, Mr. Sarpanch. No one commits suicide due to hunger. No, they do! - It's happening in our village! - No, you don't get it. - They don't! - But I have seen it happen! How do I explain this, Mr. Mishra? Listen, I'm saying they don't kill themselves due to hunger. Why do they do it? Due to depression! Look at this. There's something called depression. And these aren't my words, it's written in the WHO magazine. Number one cause, depression. Number two, heartbreak. Number three, family problems. Number four, divorce. And lastly, failure in exams. But in our village, it happens only due to starvation and poverty. Mister, poverty and starvation are just the… symptoms. The cause is different. Symptom. Cause. Cause means… the reason. Tell me the reason. The reason, like I said, is the animals eating up our crops. Firstly, this is the problem of the Forest Department. Get me a certificate from them. - And… - Alright. And there was a drought last year. No yield at all. That was last year. But, anyway… Get a certificate from the Climate Department. And? And… there was a flood… Around five years back. It happens every four or five years. They flood us from up there. From Nepal, right? That's classified as an "International Affair". Foreign ministry. Neither you nor I can touch that. Forget about it. Just get me the certificates from the Forest and Climate departments. That's it. Your job will be done! Clear! Come here. I'll give you another cause. Another cause due to which humans commit suicide. When they miss the lunch break! - May I please have my lunch? - No, yeah, please. I don't wanna be a cause for his suicide. What a buffoon… Lajjo. I have something to tell you. What do you wanna talk about now? You said you'd be back in two days. You're coming back after a week! I have some bad news. What is it? Are you getting a new wife? Damn you! Amma, did you hear him? I had told you! That's the reason your son keeps going back to the city! Aren't you ashamed?! Get ready to welcome the new bride, Amma! She'll be your slave. Have you lost your mind? I can't handle the one wife I have. Why would I get another one? God knows! One can never trust a man! I may be a man but I'm the Sarpanch of Jhundao! So, you would've gotten another wife had you not been the Sarpanch? Enough with your grumbling! She just doesn't listen! - Won't stop yapping. - Stop staring and eat! I was saying something else. Damn it… Say it, will you? What can I say… Do you remember I had coughed up blood while eating? That had stopped, right? Yes, Amma. But it recurred when I was in the city with Mahesh. I coughed up blood constantly for three or four days. Cups full. Mahesh took me to a doctor. The doctor checked me from the front and back, blood and stool. He said, "Gangaram… You have cancer." What nonsense! - Why didn't you get an injection? - What... Injection... Come on! This isn't a mere carbuncle, cancer is a serious ailment. You're a dead man walking if you have it. So, the doctor said… I just have three months to live. What are you saying?! It must've been a mistake. No, Amma. I thought the same. But I consulted a few other doctors. They said the same thing. The doctors must have gotten it wrong! As I said, all the doctors checked me, saw my reports, and said the same thing. That… I have blood cancer. And it's in the fourth stage. I have three months. The doctors said… "Enjoy your life. Fulfill all your wishes." "Do something so that people remember you." Everyone said the same thing, Lajjo. No way! That's impossible! Amma! Amma… This is impossible! Oh, God! God can't do this to us! You… You can't have such a disease! We will go to the city! Get proper treatment! Lajjo… Nothing can be done now. This is the truth and… The rest is up to God. Be it three months or three days. No… Come on. Eat. Finish your dinner. This is the jungle, Gangaram. Not your farm. Roam all you want, it's unending. You need to become the prey in order to get hunted. Should I set myself up as bait over here? No… Sitting here won't help. It could take months. You're the Sarpanch. It's your responsibility. You must find the predator yourself. But how? Pugmark! Oh, damn… I don't see any marks. What should I do? The only way is to join the other baits. Deer. Ideal bait for tigers. Hey, don't run away! I'm your leader! No, I mean I'm just like you! I'm here to become his food! Fine, you can flee when Mr. Tiger gets here! Please help me out! This won't work, Gangaram. Come on! Let's try the denser jungle. Come on, Gangaram! Get up! Oh, God! Come on! Keep walking, Gangaram! Let's go back to the jungle. Oh, my God! No way. Your leadership won't work in the jungle, Gangaram. All is not lost yet. Your food will last for four days. Better wrap it up and run away. But how will I show my face if I go back? What will I tell the villagers? Went in like a tiger, came back like a coward? You're gonna lose face! Lord Bajrangbali, have mercy! What are you thinking, Gangaram? Did you get any schemes for us from the city? Or must we all move to the city as well, just like Mahesh did. Not like Mahesh. Do you know what he does in the city? What does he do? I lived with him for five days. He picks up his shovel and some stale food and waits at the main road. Along with 200 more laborers. If someone hires them, great. Or else, they go back to their shacks. He has no contacts. He was absolutely useless! - This is what he does? - Yes. And the government's scheme for the poor… Some crap about nets and webs! What did he call it? The internet! Complex stuff. Extremely complex. But I have one solution. If you all agree, I'll suggest it. - Sure, tell us. - What is the solution? Look, when I was… leaving the government office, I spotted a notice. - Notice? - Okay. It said, "Near a tiger reserve, if someone is killed by a tiger while strolling or working in the fields, "the government will give them ten lakh rupees!" - What are you saying? - Ten lakh rupees?! His family will get ten lakh rupees! Ten lakh rupees? Ten lakh rupees! Mr. Sarpanch, how will the tiger kill anyone in the fields? The wild animals have already destroyed all our fields. Will the tiger attack us in our homes? - Hey, Buddhiya! - Just let him finish. - Why are you cutting him off? - Exactly! We'll have to pray for the tiger to prey on us. Shut up and listen! God has given you ears to listen! Yeah, please let him finish. -Loudmouth -Listen to him. Let me finish! You won't have to pray! - Please try and understand the scheme! - Yes, tell us. One Good Samaritan among us, our protector… Will go to the jungle! The tiger will attack him. And when that person is dead, we bring and plant his remains in our fields. - What is he saying? - And the very next day, as soon as we file an appeal to give us ten lakh rupees… What are you saying? - The next day? - The very next day! - He's lost his mind! - That's impossible! But who's gonna volunteer? We'll get the money the next day. I mean, on the day after the death! - That soon? - Wow, Mr. Sarpanch. Now that's a leader's planning! But tell us something, who among us will happily commit suicide like this? - Exactly! - You will do it! You! - No! No way! - No? Rubbish. You? No way. Not me. - You? - No. No, I can't do it. Hey, Jhandu. I won't do it. - Why not? He has no family. Go! - No, I won't do it. Not me, Mr. Sarpanch! - He will go. Ramdas! - No, I just got married recently. Listen to me carefully. - Hey, quiet! - Listen. He who will go into the jungle is right here, among us. What? - Who is he? - Where is he? Who is he? Have you lost your mind, Gangaram? Is this what you came up with after a week? Give the villagers a way to survive, not die! - Yes! - Exactly! - Keshav. - What? In order to give you a way to survive, I must die. Cancer will anyway kill me in three months. What? Cancer? Why not uproot the cancer ailing our village, and then die! I will go! What are you saying, Gangaram?! I will go to the jungle! Firstly, he's an opium addict. And he always dreamt of being a great leader. He'll surely go. What the hell are you saying, Gangaram? Think about it. Mom! Dad! What happened to your dad? He's going to the jungle to die! I will go as well! I wanna see the tiger as well! What nonsense! Have you lost your mind just like your father? What? Yes, you have cancer, Gangu. But you still have three months to live. So, live it with your family. We're all dying anyway. Killing yourself is a grave sin. - And it's utterly stupid. - No. If one Sarpanch's death can save the entire village, there is no deed more noble and intelligent than this. Think of the amount in question! Ten lakh rupees! Besides, they'll publish my photo in all newspapers. "Sarpanch Gangaram's great sacrifice." None of that's gonna happen. They'll put your picture on the missing person's list. And honor you with a cheap garland. That's it. Oh, not at all. At least, the government will know that there's a poor village called Jhundao. Its people are citizens of this country as well. Look, getting mauled by a tiger isn't a joke! I find it scary! Fear has already killed many people in our village. It's time to be fearless... - Listen! - Yeah? - Hey, listen to him. - We cannot be scared! A dozen of our villagers have died of fear, right? - Yes, true. - Yeah. It's time to be fearless now. Exactly! And Gangaram is a fearless leader! And a headman's head is at the disposal of his men, right? - Right. - Yeah, he's right. What do you want? Do you want our kids to go to the city like Mahesh? Eat the stale food? - No way! - Breathe in the city's polluted air? - No way! - No! Or do you want electricity, a hospital, a school in the village? Shouldn't we benefit from government schemes? - Yes, you're right. - Okay, alright. But letting a tiger maul you to death is really violent. I don't approve. The tiger is the one being violent here. Not me. The predator is violent, not the victim. The plan is that I'll go to the jungle. Get my remains and Dinesh will handle the paperwork... Lajjo! The meeting is over. Lajjo, it is... Please listen to me. We've happily spent our lives together. By the grace of God and the elders, we have two lovely kids. It doesn't matter if I'm not around anymore. Soldiers sacrifice their lives at the border as well! They fight the country's enemies, not a tiger! Poverty is our enemy as well. Eating up the village like a tiger! And it's all your responsibility? Rest assured, you're not going. Okay? Eat quietly and let me eat in peace. Amma managed to raise me after I lost my father, right? So, when I'm no more, give the leftover love to the kids. "Leftover"? Is this some gourd curry that I can feed them instead of you? If you make gourd curry one more time, I will follow Dad to the jungle. Shut up. One slap and you'll lap up the bitter gourd as well! - Finish your food! - Hey! They are kids, be kind. Yeah, right. Their dad doesn't understand kindness, and they will? Who is their father? Are you stoned already? It's all a momentary game Life is a short party It's all a momentary game Life is a short party Some have left, some will Some wait with their baggage Some have left, some will Some wait with their baggage Some wait alone, prepared It's all a momentary game Life is a short party It's all a momentary game Life is a short party Your siblings, your parents No one lasts till the end Your siblings, your parents No one lasts till the end Why wreck your life with sins? It's all a momentary game Life is a short party It's all a momentary game Life is a short party All the fortune you've made From trickery, wrongdoings All the fortune you've made From trickery, wrongdoings You won't carry any of it beyond You won't carry any of it beyond You won't carry any of it beyond It's all a momentary game Life is a short party It's all a momentary game Life is a short party The world as we know is mortal Laud, bow to your Maker, dear child The world as we know is mortal Laud, bow to your Maker, dear child Words of Guru Brahmanand Listen, oh, disciple! Words of Guru Brahmanand Listen, oh, disciple! Words of Guru Brahmanand Listen, oh, disciple! It's all a momentary game Life is a short party It's all a momentary game Life is a short party Yes, life is a short party… Yes, life is a short party… Show yourself! Ration your food, Gangaram. You have to feed yourself till you survive. Hey, Mr. Tiger! When will you come? Let's find something else to eat. - Poisonous berries? - Yes, wild and lethal! Both of Haria's sons died within two hours. - Exactly! - Yeah! What's wrong with him? He was about to commit suicide. I talked him out of it and brought him here. He's crying. Gangu, three more have died in our village. - Dinesh, I have grown old in this village. - True. But I've never seen days like these before. What the... My wife as well! She is sick. There's no one who can make me dinner! Gangu… The panchayat must do something. Yes, that's right. Anyway. We all were thinking about it. The thing you suggested the other day… There's no pressure! But if you could… -What Dinesh means is, -What? You were talking about your plan to go to the jungle, right? It can save the village… And your sacrifice will be remembered for generations to come. - This is what you mean, right? - Exactly. I am sticking to my decision! I will sacrifice my life. What good is a leader otherwise? - Well said! - Great! That's right! Truly well said. But how will it happen? I have it all planned out. But there is one problem. Problem? What kind? The other animals. You might fall sick as well. No, this one is more dangerous than cancer or the tiger. It's the… Ever-erupting volcano inside my house. Which volcano? I didn't know that you had a volcano in there! - I mean Lajjo. - Oops! Lajjo… Oh, my God! What is it? Why did you bring me here? Remember? Of course. I used to come here… To graze buffaloes. And you used to sit there and gawk at me like a monkey. And one day your father spotted me gawking at you. He got angry and he sold off his cattle. And I promised myself, to quit buffalo milk and cream until she's my wife, my dream! And I broke my vow of celibacy! Stop mollycoddling me! I remember it all. It's been 12 years since I decided to ruin my life! Now, out with it, why did you bring me here? Oh, Lajjo… It's Jhundao that is ruined. Yesterday, Haria's sons ate those poisonous berries. They killed themselves. This is getting unbearable. - So, the panchayat has decided... - As I said, you're not going anywhere. Carrying the world's burden, are you? I couldn't tell you the other day, because Amma, Nandu, and Nimmi were around. Please understand... Stupid woman! Lakhs of people gave their lives when the British were ruling India! We all know how the 23-year-old Bhagat Singh sacrificed his life! But a 46-year-old Gangaram can't do it? Did Bhagat Singh have two kids? And are you the only Bhagat Singh in the village? Put your hand down! I have 200 kids! What the hell! - Is this what you've been up to?! - Hey! - Is this what you wanted to tell me? - I'm the Sarpanch! - When did you have 200 kids? - I am the damn Sarpanch! So, metaphorically, I'm their father, right? How can a head of the family let his family die? Will he be a good leader? What do you want, Lajjo? Do you want to see me slowly succumb to cancer? Will you be able to watch me die? The greatest revolutionaries had their wives' support. This is why their statues are honored with flowers today! Silly girl, if I die of cancer, I will just die. But if I die in the jungle, I'll become immortal. They'll put up a statue of me. Standing like this. I will become a statue as well, lifeless with grief. - Is that what you want? - Of course not. Look, after I die, no other Lajjo or Gangaram will ever have to suffer due to poverty. Listen, we've had a great run of 12 years, right? Other people have wives, you have been my companion. Different. Unique. Let me go… to the jungle. Lajjo? Tell me something, Gangu. Who will perform your last rites? Your son, Nandu, he'll light your pyre, right? - Yes. - But we can only perform the last rites if there's anything left of him. That beast of a tiger… What if it eats him up like a pie? Something or the other will remain. The head, limbs, or fingers. I have a way to make that happen. Just bring my remains from the jungle, and put them in the fields. And then, call the forest officials. But the jungle is huge. How will we spot your remains? It's not a village wedding, where anyone can be spotted easily. I have a way. Send some people to the jungle every two days to look for me. Okay. And I will… I will carry that. A flying firecracker. A rocket. When I spot the tiger, I'll fire it. I want you guys to be alert. Watch out for the rocket to appear. You can spot me with its light and sound. And follow the pugmarks of the tiger to reach my remains. Okay. Bring my remains and put them in the fields. And then mourn all you can and call the Forest Department. Make sure people like Buddhiya are not around. He blabbers without thinking. He'll spill the beans. Exactly. We'll keep Buddhiya away from the officials. Put the women and kids in front, they'll weep more. Right. Absolutely. Can you handle it? Sure… Lord be with us! My heart is sinking. - Please think this through. - I already have. You have? Yes. Be careful, Gangu. - Come on! - Alright. I'll be immortal. Kabira says and everyone agrees Illusion deceives us Makes us dance to our karma Illusion deceives us all The crazy soul is on the lookout Like the musk deer searches for its musk Go, search within yourself If you can hear the soul's resonance Find your own salvation Kabira says and everyone agrees Illusion deceives us The mind smiles The soul rejoices As the beloved showers love Lajwanti, I've found you here as well. Lajjo sheds her shyness Blooms like a banana flower Entwining with attachment The restless mind Pleads and requests What a game of illusion! Wondrous and amazing Openly plays along Go, search within yourself If you can hear the soul's resonance Find your own salvation Kabira says and everyone agrees, Illusion deceives us Oh, God! Long dark nights! And my damn legs. Why are these hurting at this hour? Please bear with me, my dear legs. You'll be adorned with flowers after I die. The left, tell the right. Don't get tired, alright? Let's lie down under this tree. But what if a hyena kills me instead of a tiger? You'll get nothing. How can you say that? The jungle is full of hyenas. I mean you'll not get any money if something else kills me. Was that written on the notice? I knew it. There's always a catch in these government schemes. It's simple. It has to be a tiger attack. Okay. Get killed by some other animal and you won't get a penny. Be careful with the application. The officers are quite wary. Dinesh, did you hear that? - Yes, I did. - Make the application foolproof. I will. Find another scheme, Gangu. Won't Mom eat tonight as well? I don't know, son. Your parents have lost their minds. So, the tiger has already killed Dad? Hey! Watch it! Have you all lost your minds? God knows how my poor Gangu is coping… Granny, that's enough. Dad's doing this for the village! You know, everyone's saying that Nimmi's father is no less than a tiger himself! Lajwanti… Lajwanti… Hey, Lajwanti. Hey, Lajwanti, can you hear me? Yes, I can. Why are you yelling? Mahesh has come down from the city. Maybe he has some news about Gangaram. Hurry up. Come on, hurry. Come on! It's far better than this hellhole. Make yourself a burrow in the city. Huh? - Yeah, that's right. - Exactly. Come, Lajjo bhabhi. Welcome. I've heard about the grand plan. But there's one thing, bhabhi, he lied about cancer. Absolute crap! - What! - What?! - He lied? - He never went to see a doctor! Never got a check-up done! - What are you saying? - "Blood and stool." He just ran from one office to another for seven days. Where the hell did the damn cancer come from? What are you saying? He told everyone he had cancer! But he said… He just has three months to live. No way, bhabhi. I remember how proud he looked when he said… "Mahesh, I've found the solution to Jhundao's problem. Revolution is inevitable." Just imagine! He has always been like this. He wanted to be a true leader. A true leader! - So he… - So… The cancer was a lie! …lied to me! He went to the jungle to die?! - He wants to be a martyr. - He betrayed me. - Lajjo! - Hold her! - Get her some water! - Make her lie down. Put her on the khatiya. Get some water! Let her lie down. Get some water and a fan. Hey! Who... Look, I understand. Your husband went to the jungle to die. - I understand... - You understand? Are you his wife? You're the one married to him? No, I am not his wife. All I'm saying is, don't lose hope. I haven't lost hope. I'm just extremely angry. He has betrayed me! Look, it's been seven days since Gangaram left. - God knows if he is still alive... - Oh, shut up! He's fine! Well, I really hope he is fine. But how would we know? We must stay calm till his body is found. Yeah, you're in quite a hurry to find his corpse. That's why you stayed mum. You never said, "Gangaram, don't go alone, I'll come with you to the jungle. We'll get 20 lakh rupees instead of ten. That'll help the village a lot more." You didn't say a word! I did tell him. I tried to talk him out of it. Ask Dinesh. But he was convinced about the scheme... Just let him return! I swear, I'll teach him how to scheme! Anyway. Calm down. - He wants to be Bhagat Singh! - We have decided. Tomorrow, a group of villagers will go to the jungle. And meet the DFO… To talk about Gangaram... We're forming a scheme to find his corpse. Don't you get it? There is no corpse! Where did you vanish, mister? Slept well? You found a great spot. Hello, mister! Hey… Come, mister. Let's find something to eat before we become the food. What's your name? Jim Ahmad. Jim Ahmad? What sort of a name is that? Well, that's what it is, brother. Call me Jim Bhai or Jim Bhaijaan. Jim Bhai sounds better. The only person I call jaan… Is Lajjo. I must thank you for saving my life. That was not the plan. But I accept your gratitude. By the way, what are you doing in the jungle? I have the same question for you. But since you asked me first, I must tell you. This jungle is my office. I am at work right now. So, you're a government officer? I am a poacher. Poacher? Is that some kind of a forest guard? They hire people to do that? - What's your name again? - I am Gangaram. - Mr. Gangaram… - Yes? - Basically, I am a hunter. - Really? A hunter? But why do you hunt? You're too naive. Aren't you aware? Animal skins, their bones… Their blood… It fetches big money in the international market. I don't know about animals, but poor villagers' lives are worth nothing. But what you do is illegal, right? Yeah, did I ever claim to be a law-abiding citizen? What if you get caught? I'll go to jail. By the way, so will you. The cops won't take you out for an excursion. Why is that? This is a tiger reserve. A government reserve. Forget about poaching, trespassing is illegal as well. I'm not just strolling, you see. - I am here to sacrif... - A picnic? Not at all. I am here to die. Whoa, brother! That's some good stuff you've been smoking. No... - I don't smoke up. - You hardly find good stuff these days. I don't smoke up. I only have Lord Shiva's holy offerings. And I am really here to die. It's a long story. Do you wanna hear it? You're quite a weirdo. Not just weird. I am poor as well. Why do you say that? I mean, you're the Sarpanch, yet you offered to die. I'm not the kind of leader who'd send cadres to die. - Really? - Yes! Great. Who is the best leader of all? Gangaram, Gangaram! You should've been in Delhi. What are you doing in the jungle? For me, Mr. Jim, Jhundao is Delhi. I see. By the way, just like I intrigue you, your name intrigues me. Jim. Who named you? Have you heard of Jim Corbett? Yes, the famous poet. No, brother… - He was a great hunter. - Really? Once upon a time, a man-eating leopard from Nepal had entered our village after killing 125 humans. - Okay. - The news reached Jim sir. So, he came and did a recce, set a target on the leopard, and finished it off. He was lauded for it. So, that's it, my grandpa… A delicate man with a poetic heart… Named me "Jim Ahmad" after I was born. Wow! - He was a great man, Mr. Jim Carbide. - Of course. - Corbett. Jim Corbett. - Right. Indeed he was. Started off by saving humans from animals. But when he realized humans are the most brutal animal, he began saving animals from humans. Wow, so he switched sides. Then why do you kill animals? You could save them as well, just like him. Mr. Gangaram, the reason why the tiger kills the deer… Is exactly why I kill the tiger. To survive. That reminds me, - are you carrying food? - Yes. I'm really famished. Come, let's break bread. Then we can break the law. - Just a second. - Yes, sir. Tell me from the beginning. When did he go to the jungle? Sir, it's been nine days now. Why? You see, the animals... Sir, this year… - The animals ruined all our crops. - Yeah. Yes, sir. So, he went into the jungle looking for food. - Food or wood? - Food, sir. You know it's unlawful to enter the jungle without a permit, right? - Don't you? - Sir, the poor… Can't always follow the laws. That's enough. Stop being dramatic. We'll look into it. But remember, it's been nine days. His chances of survival are really low. That's okay, sir. But please find his remains for the last rites. - For his family, so that… - We will surely try. - You may leave. - Sir, please help us. - We will. - Yes, sir, for his wife's sake. - No. - What's wrong, Mr. Gangaram? Why don't you eat? Sir, this goes against the principles of my religion. I am a vegetarian. I don't want to sin. I'll have to cleanse myself by conducting a puja. I don't have enough money anyway. - No! - Don't think so much. It's a nilgai, a kind of deer. You'll have to make do with this for now. Eat. Look, insulting food is equally sinful. Sir, I'm trying to go to heaven by sacrificing myself. Why are you dragging me to hell? Get it away from me. Look, heaven and hell… These are man-made concepts. Is this big bad world any less than hell? Nothing is more heavenly to the hungry than food. Come on, eat. Take it. Oh, man… True, I will have to survive till I die. Okay. Eat. It's alright… Would you have starved if it was beef? Absolutely. Cows… We consider the cow to be holy. I won't eat it. I ate a wild boar once. I was really hungry. Then I got scared. Thought, "I have betrayed Allah." But it saved my life. Weren't you scared of the Mullahs? Allah is keeping a count of my sins. It's our personal matter. I'll sort it out with Him. Why must a Pandit or a Maulana decide what I do with my short life? I'm not sure about hunting, but you're a good orator. Thank you, brother. By the way, how is your relationship? Beautiful. - Really? - We have two lovely kids. Not with your wife. With Him. - With Him? - Yes. May you live a long and healthy life. They will all die if I live a long and healthy life. Bless me… so that I die soon. Fine, may Lord Bajrangbali fulfill all your wishes! Jim Bhai… can you do me favor? What favor? I have roamed the wild for ten days, but I couldn't spot Mr. Tiger. This is your workplace. You know this jungle like the back of your hand. Will you help me find the tiger? Mr. Gangaram… The trap which ensnared you, I had set it up for the tiger. I've cut a hefty deal with a Chinese client. Be patient. We may kill two birds with the same stone. We will. The tiger you intend to kill, I intend to be killed by it. And if you help me with this, the future generations of my village will be really grateful to you. Just remember, when we find the tiger, let it get me first, finish me off. Shoot it after it's done. Or else, all my efforts will be in vain. Will you do it? Mr. Gangaram… You should've been kept in the museum. You're no ordinary man. You're one in a million. It will happen. It will! Yeah! Oh, follower Where do you search for me? Oh, follower Where do you search for me? I am right here, with you I am right here, with you Oh, follower Where do you search for me? Why search for me… Nor in pilgrimage, neither in clay idols Neither in solitude Hey! Jim Bhai! Nor in the temple, neither in a mosque Neither in Kaaba nor Kailash Oh, follower Where do you search for me? Oh, follower Where do you search for me? I am right here, with you I am right here… Mr. Jim, you know a lot about the jungle. I came across a holy snake a few days ago. Are there shape-shifting snakes in the jungle as well? It's all rubbish, Mr. Gangaram. It happens only in films. What are you doing? - No, it's just... - Coloring your hands green? These are some bitter leaves. Neem and stuff like that. If Mr. Tiger eats me, it will spare the thumb and we'll be able to claim the money. Seek earnestly and you shall discover In a moment of quest Seek earnestly and you shall discover In a moment of quest Listen carefully, says Kabira Listen carefully, says Kabira I reside in your faith I reside in your faith Oh, follower Where do you search for me? Oh, follower Where do you search for me? I am right here, with you I am right here, with you Oh, follower Where do you search for me? Why do you search for me… A tiger travels 10 to 15 kilometers a day. Sometimes more. Oh, my God! Is it a tiger or a bus? So, we've to walk at least that much to keep up with it. Okay. All paths in the jungle seem to be the same. Tell me, how old is the jungle? Very old, Gangaram. Not years, but ages. Remember, before all of us, before animals and insects, even before life began on earth… There was the jungle. You mean… When nothing was there, the jungle was there? - And when nothing will be left... - The jungle will remain. Sometimes you seem more of a poet than a hunter. It's the environment, you see. Spend more time here, you'll turn into a poet before the tiger gets you. I just hope the tiger gets here soon. Stay there. Don't move. Just wait for the orders, okay? Yes, right there. Do not move, okay? - Should we send the search party? - Yes. God knows if the villagers are telling us the truth. Maybe our old friend has employed him. Many officers help Jim as well. That's the reason he's survived so far. It's just a matter of days. He thinks he's a big hunter… By killing innocent animals. Don't shoot him on the leg this time. Just finish him off. I want a clean Jhundao. The jungle only looks silent. It speaks to us. We must listen to its wind. Watch its falling leaves. Listen to the whispering grass. Furthermore, furthermore… We must respect its silence. Wow, brother. If the jungle speaks to you, ask it about the tiger. - Ask! - A tiger is not a gas station. You won't find one every five kilometers. Besides... What? What is it? A mark. Whose marks? - The tiger's… - Tiger's? Is it around? Hey, show yourself! - Come on! Face me! - Hey, shut up! Come here! Come here! Okay. Come on! Keep quiet. Sit! These marks don't belong to the tiger we're tracking. Look, its front paw is larger than T371's. And there's a small one too. Here. It could be T22. And its excreta tells us… It's had diarrhea for some time now. Are you a stomach doctor as well? Do tigers and deer have numbers? T22… 2070? And we have a tough time getting ration card numbers. But these animals have numbers?! Yes… Tigers have numbers in the jungle. That's how the officials track them. So, be ready. T22 must be around… What happened? It's definitely T22. Bad luck. It's had its kill. But it hasn't gone too far. Let's rest here tonight. We'll continue tomorrow. Sleep on the tree again? No, not here. There are… some old ruins nearby. We'll go there. Old ruins? It will keep us safe. It'll keep us safe? Who will? No one. The place will keep us safe. - Oh… - Any problem? If a ghost kills me, my plan will fail. We won't get the money and the villagers won't even touch the corpse. Don't be so scared. If the ghost is ghostly, we are… Ghastly! Don't worry. Come, let's go. We're running out of food. This is the last bit. We have to go hunting tomorrow. So, do wives cook in the animal kingdom as well? It's the lioness who hunts for the lion. I see. But, Mr. Jim… This tastes weird. What do you mean? Check for yourself. I am a vegetarian, I wouldn't know. Mr. Gangaram, why did you eat it? It's rotting. Oh, no! That's what I thought! My stomach's acting up. - I have to take a dump. I'll be back. - What's wrong, mister? Just a bit of meat took a toll on your system? Don't even ask… My stomach's system is just like this country's system. These delicate vegetarians… That's why we... Oh, damn! Stop! Mr. Gangaram, wait. I'll come with you. I cannot wait. Oh, no! I'm done for! I guess a scorpion has stung me. You wouldn't be talking if it had. Though, this place is full of venomous snakes. Please don't say that. If a snake or a scorpion kills me, my scheme will fail. Lord, what are you punishing me for in the middle of the night? Did I make a mistake by coming to the jungle as the leader? What happened? Is it that bad? Oh, it's gushing out! Like an open tank! What can I say? I'm in the same situation as well. But think about it. Both our faiths preach… What we must eat, what we mustn't, but in the end, it all turns into shit. And shit has no religion, no caste. It's the same for everyone. Yeah. When you're pooping it out, whether you're rich or poor, no matter what your faith, class, or caste, it's all the same. And with time, that's what we all become. Time engulfs us, and we become its excreta. In the end, we turn into earth. As ashes… Or as the soil from the grave. We become nothing but manure. I've never had a deeper conversation while shitting. You must write a book, Mr. Jim. Chuck the hunting, the gun. Write a book. You really think I should write a book? Yes, you must. It will enlighten the kids who read it. Such profound philosophy! But I won't write about vegetarians, Mr. Gangaram. - Oh, come on. - No, really… Lajjo? Lajjo! Lajjo! Lajjo! Lajjo! Mr. Jim? Jim Bhai… Where is he? You've made the wrong decision, Gangu. I'm the one who has one foot in the grave anyway. I should go to the jungle. Oh, Amma… You can't go to the loo alone, you'll go to the jungle alone? Don't try to be a martyr. Look, the doctor told me, "You have three months, Gangaram. Live them the way you want to." So, let me! Whether you live for three months… Or three days, no mother can bear to see her son die. - Let me go, please! - Calm down, Amma. Will the government believe the theory that an old lady was working in the fields? Look, I'm the one who's destined to make this sacrifice. Let me do it. Okay? You've given birth to a tiger. Don't cry. Stop it, okay? Good morning! Hey! Jai Hind! You won't need me if you vanish alone like this. It's you who had vanished. I was just freshening up. Your angel, T22, is around as well. Did you meet him? Near the water? Tigers often rest in the water to cool down. Let's hurry, if T2 leaves, my scheme will fail. Let's go. Hail Bajrangbali... What are you doing? Keep it low. Hail Bajrangbali. Jim Bhai, I have reached my destination. After I die, do come to my village to put a garland on my statue. I can't invite you after I'm dead, that's the reason I'm inviting you now. Okay? Give me a hug. Will you shut up? We've found him now. I have to go now. Give me a farewell? Mr. Gangaram! Calm down. Listen to me. T22 is not a man-eater. And I believe he's full after that deer kill. The chances of him attacking you are really low. Animals don't hunt with a full stomach? But humans keep hunting even after they are satiated! So, this is all in vain... - There is a way. - What? Go close. Irritate him, instigate him. Maybe he'll attack you. I'm good at that. My speech can instigate people, I'm a leader after all! Okay, listen. Jim Bhai! Let… Let him kill me. And then you shoot him… And fire this rocket. That will indicate our location to my villagers. - Take it. - Go! Should I go? - Alright. - Quiet. Quiet! Go on. Okay! What the hell are you doing, Mr. Gangaram! Opium pills! It will hurt less. We'll both have a good time. What a weirdo! Go on! Greetings, sir. I hope you're doing alright. I need your help. Look… Please kill me right now. I will be grateful to you forever. It's a request. Come on... Come on… Mr. T2, this is serious! I got sick of running from one government office to another! That's the reason I chose this path. I came to you. Kill me. Pull me into your web, and give me a certificate, so that my village can be saved. Mr. T2? Hey, T2! T2! Go on! What? Hey, T2! T2! Why did you stand up? Can't you hear me? Fine, since you're up, why don't you attack already? Are you deaf, damn it?! What are you doing, Mr. Gangaram! He will run away. Mr. Jim, I have handled people who are far more stubborn! Be quiet. You coward, where are you going?! Do you know who I am?! I am the Sarpanch of Jhundao! My word is an order. - Stop! - Mr. Gangaram! You've lost your mind. Get out of my way, I will shoot it! No, you can't shoot! We had decided that you will kill him only after he kills me. It will save my village. Please do me a small favor! Don't do this! And you, are you a tiger or a cat? Mr. Gangaram, he won't attack you. Why won't he?! What about the bloody scheme?! Are you a fake? A man dressed as a tiger? Why don't you join the circus? Move, Mr. Gangaram, you'll get shot! No, I will not move, Mr. Jim! You can shoot me but I won't move! Hey, come on! Attack me! Are you trying to scare me with that growl? You can't scare me! If you're a tiger, I'm a brave heart too! Damn, come on! Come on, attack me! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Come on! Stop staring, damn it! Come on! As the greatest saints say… What... - Run! - The world is an illusion - Stop, bastard! - Get him! - Stop! - Get him! Life is a short affair… - Stop! - We'll shoot! The show won't last long… Jim, stop! What did you bring to this world? What will you take back? - Stop! - Get him! Life is a short affair… Take positions. Jim! The show won't last long Fire! -As the greatest saints say -Why were you running? - Why did you run? - No, sir. The world is an illusion - He... - Come on, get the car. - Life is a short affair… - Come on! Come on! -The show won't last long -Sir… Clear the body. -The world is an illusion -Sir… Where are you taking me, sir? -The world is an illusion -Yeah, we know who you are! You were just here to dance, right? - What did you bring to this world? - Save your speech for the court. What will you take back? Life is a short affair… The show won't last long State vs. Gangaram, case no. 8226/M/13/26T. The accused is found guilty as per IPC sections 120B, 447, 429, 379, and 34, Wild Life Prevention Act section 51I, and Arms Act section 25 by the police. Bring the accused to the stand. USE OF CELL PHONES IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED The police are accusing you of going to the jungle to kill a tiger. You helped a poacher as well. Is this true? No, sir. I didn't go to the jungle to kill a tiger. Neither to hunt one down. Rather, I wanted to be hunted by it. Order, order! Tell us the truth. Why did you go to the jungle? I am telling you the truth, sir. You see… We are a poor village, Jhundao. I am its Sarpanch. I've been roaming the government offices, scouting for a scheme that could help us, the poor. I was made to stand in lines, over and over. I was told, "Go to the internet. And, uh… line up online." Sir, no one helped me out. And as I was leaving… I noticed a notification. That read, "If a tiger… Kills someone near the jungle, the family will get ten lakh rupees." I returned to the village. Lied to everyone, my wife and mother, I managed to convince them and went off to the jungle to get killed by the tiger. So that we could get the money. Sir, I did meet the hunter in the jungle. Jim. He wanted to kill the tiger. I met him and he said, "I'll help you find the tiger." Then, the forest officers shot the hunter. Jim Ahmed. So, that's all, sir. Gangaram's story of him trying to save his village… Caught the attention of a small-time journalist. The news was unique and interesting. It spread like wildfire. It went viral on social media. #JusticeforGangaram. #SaveJhundao #BraveheartGangaram was trending. From Kashmir to Kanyakumari, Gujarat to Arunachal Pradesh, people were furious! They couldn't believe that a nation aiming for a trillion-dollar economy, had citizens… Who are willing to get killed by a tiger merely for ten lakh rupees. Thousands were thronging the Sessions Court hearings. There were candle marches. Reporters, intellectuals, writers, human rights activists, political and student leaders, everyone was blaming each other. The tiger was declared… Our national animal during Pandit Nehru's term. That's the root of the problem! Only the Mother Goddess Cow, deserves to be our national animal. That would've solved it. After all, the cow eats grass. She wouldn't eat Gangaram. If the forest department can prove that the tiger was born in India, - not in a foreign land like Indonesia… - The tiger's name is T22! Its stripes show that it was born in India. Did we get to the top of the food chain so that an animal can snatch our right? - Is that even justified? - Just a second! Just because animals can't talk, we'll treat them as we please? - Don't they feel pain as well? - You're right. Bravo, so save the animals from pain, but hurt the humans. Poverty and starvation aren't enough. Now the tiger... Just hear me out! Gangaram wasn't denied his right due to the tiger. He was denied because he is poor and uneducated. - Thanks to capitalism... - And the solution is communism? What else is the solution? - Please tell me! - Great! Look at him sloganeering against poverty while sitting in an AC room. And they won't talk about Indian tigers, but Siberian tigers. Because Siberia is a part of Russia! And they're communists! How is any of this rubbish related to the Gangaram's issue? - You call it rubbish? - No! No! - What are you trying to say?! - I have a point here! - Let's get to the point! - Please let him finish! Silence! Silence! This is my show! - Please don't turn it into a circus! - Order, order! PLEASE MAINTAIN SILENCE The court has heard both sides. Before we deliver the verdict, Gangaram, do you have anything to say? Yes, sir. I would love to, if you are interested in listening. Sir… Had anyone lent an ear to what I had to say… It would've saved us all this trouble. Our village, Jhundao, is right beside the jungle. Our ancestors have been living there for ages. So, our relationship with the jungle and its animals had always been peaceful. The problems began a few years ago. When wild animals enter our fields, kids think they are our enemies. All they think is, "Kill them!" Sir… I have spent a few days and nights in the jungle. Now I'm confused about who the real enemy is. Are the animals the trespassers? Or are we? Sir, something is going on… On the other side of the jungle, something we can't see. And due to it the animals are straying into the villages. Villagers are running to the city. And the city-dwellers, well, their hunger has no end. Sir… The primary reason behind it all is poverty and starvation. Only the poor are dying in our Jhundao, not the poverty, sir. It remains as is. Sir, please do us a favor. The government has an entire team to look after the animals. Employed tonnes of people. Kindly have a team appointed to look after us as well. Otherwise, the poor will become extinct as well. Like animals, the government must protect the poor as well or else, in a few years, we'll be found in the museum. Our innards will be taken out, we'll be stuffed with straw, and stones will replace our eyes. And it will read, "Here!" Look at a poor man from Jhundao, Gangaram. "Circa previous century. India." That will be the caption. Do something for us. Maybe a separate reserve forest. We'll live there like animals. And just like they pay to see animals in a forest, they will come to see us! We'll live like animals. All nude. Won't wear clothes. Our children will play in the dust, our women will feed them milk. We'll live on the trees, jump around. Lick and drink water, like this. We'll behave exactly like animals! It'll be very entertaining, sir. Take photographs, if you will! But give us, the poor, a reserve forest as well! But make sure, sir, no hunter comes looking for us. And if you find another Gangaram, please don't shoot. Just give the poor a reserve forest to stay in. And me, well, you must punish me gravely. I want to be immortal. Make it something drastic. That's all. Considering all the witness statements and evidence presented in court, the court concludes that… Seek fragrance in dead flowers Seek fragrance in dead flowers Humans are idiots Such ludicrous demands! Seek fragrance in dead flowers And that's how Gangaram won all the battles and went on to become an example. Camera's rolling, sir. And… action! Sir, dialogue. Action? Cut! Sir, you have to say this dialogue. - Oh, I see. Yes. - Yeah. "Chyawanprash." Okay. Alright. - Ready? - Yeah. And roll camera! Action! The secret behind me surviving ten days in the jungle! But I didn't take this with me. - Cut it. - I would be lying. - Sir, this is an advertisement. - Right. - Don't worry, just say the lines. - Okay! And, action! The secret behind me surviving ten days in the jungle! Tiger Chyawanprash. Containing herbs collected from the same jungle. Natural, uh, Ayurvedic Chyawanprash, Tiger! Makes every heart a brave heart. Tiger Chyawanprash. Seek fragrance in dead flowers - Laugh? - Yes. Seek fragrance in dead flowers Humans are idiots Such ludicrous demands! Seek fragrance in dead flowers HUMAN-ANIMAL PRESERVATION CAMPAIGN When alive, they want to fly in the sky When alive, they want to fly in the sky Yet, when dead… - Say, Sherdil. - Sherdil. Inaugural shot, take one! - Inaugural shot? - Take one! - Take one? - Yes. - Yes! - Use the clapboard. Good. Thank you. Done? Sir, move away from the camera. Yes, come here. Thank you. And… action! They clear off the greenery Build houses in the fields Cementing the breathing soil Driving nails into the sand They live indoors, behind curtains Imprisoned within four walls - Brother, excuse me. - Yes, sir? Where is our food? All of it is meant for you, sir. You can eat whatever you want. - All of it is ours? - Yes, sir. They're lost in their own world And when they return They want the greenery back Humans are idiots Seek fragrance in dead flowers Seek fragrance in dead flowers Humans are idiots Such ludicrous demands! Seek fragrance in dead flowers Lajjo, look at the amount of food people are wasting here. We could feed all the kids in Jhundao with it. You know how they fatten the goat before slaughtering it? I'm feeling like the goat right now. Nonsense! Why are you talking rubbish? Let's eat and go home. Fine, I'll keep my mouth shut. I miss Jim today. He would've sat with us if he were here. Anyway, the government's gonna send many schemes to our village now! I get angry every time you mention a scheme. Come on… Done eating? - Done? - Are you full? Any dessert for you, sir? Any dessert for you, sir? No, no… No. But not every tale has a happy ending. Some ends are bizarre. Just like this case. Let's go through the plan before we go to the spots? Sure. The spot where you met the tiger, we will set up a cafeteria there. And… we'll have a ticket counter. And the tree on which the leopard attacked you, we'll get a nice model of a toy leopard from China and put it there. - Kids will find it interesting. - Yeah, right. And the ruins, where you spent the night with the poacher… I'm thinking of renovating it, set it up nicely with glossy marble tiles, you know? A proper place! And then we can… Set up a cafe there. Well, let's see. What do you think of the plan so far? Mister, what is your designation in the Tourism Department? I am the OSD from the party. Okay. So, you've planned it all? No, it's the minister's brainchild. Okay. - But do you like it... - I'm full. I mean, my bladder, it's full. Oh, sure! Hey, please pull over. Do you wanna join me? - No, please proceed. - Okay.
