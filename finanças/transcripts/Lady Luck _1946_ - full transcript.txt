You not gonna hurt nearly as bad as you've hurt me. You lucky I ain't shoot your butt. But you gonna burn, James. Yeah, you gonna burn real good, Mr. Jesse James Desperado, bang bang.

Well let me enlighten you just a minute, okay? He's gonna start off by takin' 15 % as your agent, 10 % as your manager, another, hm, 25 % as your label, and then Uncle Sam is gonna take 40 % of whatever else is left, and that lame Gucci knock off purse on my floor. With them pale shoulders. James, get out that bathroom! - Tia, baby, listen. Can we talk about this a little later, man? - Are you serious? - Yeah. - It's over, James. - Oh, damn. Hey, hey we still got some business to conduct, man, what is you trippin' on? I hope you choke and die! - Dammit. Son of a bitch. - Can I get you a menu, ma'am? - No. I'd just like a slice of apple pie, and a cup of coffee please. - Oh, I'm sorry, but that gentleman over there just bought our last pie. Bakers'll be in tomorrow, they'll make some new, be hot and fresh-- - Well that's just great. Are you out of coffee, too? - I'll be right back with your coffee. - Wait. I'm sorry. It's just... I'm sorry. It's just that... Tonight I watched my whole life crash and burn before my eyes. Hey, you sure you're gonna be alright? - Everything's gonna be fine. Can I just please have my coffee? Black, no sugar, no cream, please. - Coming right up. Alright, mister, your order's ready. That'll be $10 even. Anything else I can get for you tonight? - Yes, um, no, you know what, on second thought, I think I'm gonna dine in. Can I get two plates, please? - Of course. - Excuse me. I overheard your conversation with the waitress and that, um, it would seem that I've bought all the pie, and, you know what? I don't think I can eat it all. My name's Coron. May I buy you a cup of coffee? - You know, that seems like a really nice offer, Coron, but I'm a little anti-man tonight. - It's okay. I accept that, you know, I get a little anti-man myself at times. Can I at least get your name? - My name is Gabriele. Coron, you seem like a nice guy, but right now I'm really not in the mood for conservation or company, and I hope you understand that. - Fair enough. Let me give you my card, and, well... Are you sure you don't wanna share some of this delicious, sweet apple pie? - Do you love your wife? - I beg your pardon? - I said, do you love your wife? - I loved my wife. She died two years ago of breast cancer. She was definitely the love of my life. And my best friend. - Well I'm sorry for your loss. - You know, looking back over... Over time, that first year was the most difficult. But you know, I got through that with the grace of God. Now my practice is busy and I have very little idle time. What about you? Are you married? - Idle time. That's just something my husband had too much of. - You know what they say. An idle mind is the devil's workshop. You are obviously going through something. He cheated on you? - After all these years, of putting my life on hold, and in return, I come home, and he's in our bed with another woman. You damn right he cheated. On me, and on everything I believed in. - I am so sorry to hear that. I am so sorry for that. You know, I have plenty of time. We can talk about it, I'm a great listener, and, I promise you, there will be no strings attached. - You know what? This is so embarrassing. I'm sittin' here pourin' my life out to a stranger. I'm sorry, I have to go. - Hey, Stella, I need for you to watch Dawn tonight. There's an opening on the night shift and I really need the extra money. Can you handle that? - Yeah, I got you. - Uh uh, baby, don't be lightin' that stinky stuff up in my house. Matter of fact, don't even smoke that mess while I'm gone, Stella. You need to be focused on Dawn tonight-- - Alright, alright, alright, got you. - Dawn, baby, give me a hug before mommy leave. Love you. Call me if Aunt Stella get to actin' a fool. - If she can call you, then she can watch herself. - Whatever. You better watch my baby. - Why are you so protective? Why you always worried? That girl ain't no baby. She gonna be alright. And you don't want me to smoke? You know I got glaucoma, look at my eyes. - Really Stella? - Look. - If you got glaucoma, then I've got rabies. - Girl, you got bit? Quit playin'. You know what? When you have kids and responsibilities, then you just might understand. Bye. - Bye. You better watch my daughter, Stella. - She can watch herself. - I always knew you'd help people. You were always so caring and helping when you were a child. Oh that institute is lucky to have you. I wish your father was here to see you. He'd be so proud of you. Well, the time has finally come. Can't say that I'm, ready. But I'm happy for ya. - Oh, mom, nothing has changed, okay? I'm just going off to school. - I know, I placed that letter on your bed. - Yes, ma'am, and I got it, I got it. - Oh, good, what did it say? Your school loans alright? - Stop worrying, okay, everything is taken care of. My room and board, books, food, everything is okay. Stop worrying, I love you. - I love you, too, pumpkin. I bless it. When your father left, I gave him this Bible. And I know he'd like nothing more than for you to have it for your protection. I gave it to him for protection. Not much, but... Inside this Bible is some money. - Oh thank you so much, I love you. I appreciate it, but listen. You have got to stop worrying about me. I'll be okay, alright? God is on my side. - Hey, boo. How you doin'? Come on in here. Um... So... My sister's daughter is in the room sleep, so you can sit in here and watch TV or somethin', just keep it down. - What? Y'all leavin' me out here by myself? Damn. Ain't no fun 'til the homie can get some. - Uh uh. Don't be touchin' me. I don't even do all that. You better get your life. Get your homeboy. - Be cool, man, yo bro, let me get mine. - Yeah. Some nasty stuff, touchin' on me. Everybody wanna touch Stella. - Ain't got no Playstation. Be here all by myself. - For real? Nigga grow up. - Yeah, nigga, grow up. - It's a beautiful day outside. Gabriele, 'sup baby? Oh who is this? - Hold up, hold up, hold up, we got to talk, man. - James, we have nothing to talk about. - Man, you know we need to talk. - We don't need to talk. - Gabby, do you need me to call the cops? - Hey, hey, hey, shut up, bitch. Excuse you? - Who you callin' a bitch? - James, excuse you. I work here, you are embarrassing me. - Man, fuck this job man, come on holler at me-- - No, we have nothing to talk about. James, it's over. - You need to stop right there. I'm gonna call the police. - Get your Cosby Show lookin' ass up out of here. - You need to leave. - I bought some roses for you. Not a stain on me. - Man. Get your hands off me. Leave me alone! - Get the hell out, you get the hell out. It's okay. You can tell your boy, he can run, be he can't hide. I'm calling the cops, he goin' to jail. - Wait a minute, I ain't got nothin' to do with this. - What? I invited you, you brought him here. You get the hell out. Get the hell out. - Shit, I'm gone. - It's okay. Baby, it's okay, it's okay. - Dawn, baby. Where's Dawn at? - She's okay, Tammy, she's in the room-- - Shut up, Stella. I don't wanna see you or hear your voice. Get your shit and get the hell out of our home. - Tammy, wait, I'm sorry. Where am I gonna go? - It ain't my damn problem. Get out! Get out, Stella! - Sir. Excuse me, hi. I'm here about the ad in the paper, the one bedroom apartment? - Have a seat, I'll be right with ya. - Your coffee, sir. - Thank ya. Alright, sorry, who's first? - I was first. I got my deposit and my first month rent. So can I get my key? - Um excuse me, I faxed you my application yesterday. - Sister girl, that don't matter. I was here first today. - She probably can't even pass the credit check. - Oh hold on, you don't even know me like that. - Ladies, ladies, ladies. Let's be civilized here. The three bedroom is still vacant. Or you have the option of rentin' week to week at that motel I manage across the street. But, it's gonna be more economical if you take advantage of this luxurious three bedroom apartment I have today. - Uh, wait, excuse me, you said a three bedroom apartment? Because your ad says a one bedroom apartment. - Oh check the date. She probably at the wrong place anyway. - That Martha at the ad agency. Ain't worth a damn. At least once a year she prints the wrong information. - Um, excuse me, but I hope I'm not too late for the one bedroom apartment? - Ah, really? Okay. - What? - Okay. Looks like we have a slight problem here. Look, you all look like good girls, so I'll tell ya what I can do. One month's free rent for the misprint in the newspaper. - Misprint? - Now, the only problem we got, it's the end of the month, and I've got to have that property occupied by five pm today. And, lookin' at my Gucci, it's about that time. - That used to be my song. I didn't know you was rollin'-- - It ain't really a Gucci, it's a Timex. - It sure ain't. - But you get the picture. Okay, ladies. What's it gonna be? ♫ Was not lookin' for no love affair ♫ But where would I have found you - Ladies, I must say, this is a weird situation. But my ex husband closed all my accounts tryin' to force me to come home. I need this place. - Well I have to be honest with the both of you. I can't go back home. My mother thinks that I've been accepted into a major university. If she knew the truth, if she knew what I was really doin', it would break her heart. This has been a lifetime dream for my family, so I need this place as well. - Oh. I just hope neither one of you is gay. I mean... I'm just sayin'. - Wait, wait, Stella. What does that have to do with anything? Are you uncomfortable with your sexuality? I mean, what's wrong with bein' gay? Try it, you might like it. - Miss Stella don't munch on carpet. Okay? Check yourself, before you wreck yourself. Okay? - What did she say? - She's so silly. - Munch on carpet? - Is that the highest one, Monique? - Yep. - Oh my goodness. Okay ladies, we are finally in our new home. And I have to say, I am really excited about gettin' to know the both of y'all. - Well, I'ma tell y'all now, I looked at my schedule and with the amount of classes I have this semester, I will be at school a whole lot. - I thought you said you didn't get into school. - No, that's not what I said. I said I didn't get into a major university. I'm still at a JC. - A JC? Girl, a JV college? You at one of them colleges where you take the stuff online and you get a fake degree? - No girl, junior college. - Oh, my bad, damn. - What are you in school for? - Anaesthesiology. - What? Go girl. What about you Stella? What do you do? Everyday I'm hustlin'. All kinds of stuff, we tryin' to make ends meet. You can just say I'm in the pharmacy. - Oh, so you are an urban pharmaceutical exchange broker? Interesting. - What? - She's a drug dealer. - I don't sell no drugs. 'Cause what I got to offer, is a little different. This is-- - Wait a minute, Stella, how could you do somethin' like that? - I do what I do to get paid. Girl, no, I've been on my own since I was 16. You know, between fightin' off my uncles, and fightin' off my daddy, I gotta get out here in these streets. I didn't have anybody out there doin' anything for me, and I might not be all, lady like and corporate-y like y'all, but, you know, I had to do my thing. - You know what, Stella? I'm really sorry for you. - Girl don't worry about it, I'ma get mine regardless. - Well that's really good, Stella, but you can't bring that lifestyle around here. I ain't trying to live in a cage house. - A cage house? Girl you mean a trap house? - Trap house, a cage house. The trap, the jail. Whatever you wanna call it, that's fine, but I don't need my cheatin' husband thinkin' I'm broke down caught up in jail. That's all he needs. - Girl, he cheated on you? - See? That's why I ain't got no problems gettin' no money from no man, what? Or anything else I want, you feel me? - Wait a minute, Stella. I'm sorry about what happened to you, I am, but I don't agree with that. All men are not like that. - You been havin' your head in them books too long. Girl, all men are dogs. And they all got tricks. - Okay, let's think happy thoughts. First, we need to go over a couple things we need to agree upon, okay? Like house rules. And we need to respect each other's space and privacy. - Okay, well let's start, I'll start. - Of course. - Rule number one, okay, I think there should be no guys spending the night. - Girl, what's wrong? You gay, you don't like men? - No, I love men, I do. But I also love my privacy. - I do, too. - Okay? - Well I can tell right now, it's fixin' to be a problem up in here. Me on, and let you get a whiff. - Don't nobody want none of your raggedy box. That's not funny, miss. And first of all, it ain't raggedy. - It's raggedy. How you know? - I think it's just 'cause of the tights. I think she just be watchin'. - It's raggedy. I think she's a little gay. - Excuse me. Mhm? - Does Stella live here? - Yeah, she there, just ring the doorbell. - Alright, I appreciate it. So, what's wrong with her? She's old, raggedy, needs to be driven in the river. No, seriously, it's just old and I just need to get me a new car. - Well I mean, I know a little bit about cars, I could-- - Oh really? - Yes, ma'am. I'm a certified mechanic, actually. - Okay. - Yeah, you know, we got a shop down the street. - Okay. - Here's my card. - Oh. Thank ya. - Yeah, just drop her off, if you want me to check her out, I'd be more than happy to. - Okay, I will, thank you. - Oop, thank you, you won't be needing this. - Stella, what are you doin'? He's a mechanic, he offered to look at my car. - Um, Monique, the last time I checked, right up there on the corner there was a Pep Boys, an Advanced Auto, a AutoZone, a Meineke, and a Midas. - Really? - Why don't you check them out? Let them look at it. Great. Come on boo thang. Come on. I-- - She is so silly. - Girl how you be studyin' early in the morning? - Girl, it ain't easy. I just don't see-- I know we said don't no men need to sleep over here, right? Didn't we say don't no men need to sleep over here? - Uh yeah. - Did he just... Oh, you just gonna go all up in the fridge. Open it if you want to. What the hell are you doin'? Put that knife down before you hurt yourself. - Your man ain't bought nothin' in this refrigerator, and if you put your hand in there, you bound to lose it. - I mean, is this how y'all treatin' y'all guests around here? - I'm sorry. First of all, he ain't my man, and y'all trippin'. Y'all is for real about this? - We all agreed. And you, you are not our guest. We could easily kill you now, say you broke in. We feared for our lives. Gabby, are you scared? 'Cause I'm scared. - Ooo, I'm so scared, Monique. If only I could reach for my pistol right here in my purse on the counter. - No, it's really not that serious. I could get away from you. - Don't touch me. - Yes, ma'am. - Do what you need to do. - Okay. I'm sorry. I broke the golden rule. But this some silly ass shit. And this ain't the time. - You right, Stella, it ain't the time. - Okay. I'ma get back, act like you didn't put that knife in my face. - 'Cause she don't, I'll cut her. - She gonna want him back in this house. I'll cut her, and him. Class or not, he get cut up, she get cut up. - Okay. Monique, Gabby, I'm sorry. Last night, we got to drinkin', he was drinkin', I was drinkin'. We got drunk. You know, then one thing led to another, and then next thing you know, it was like,. - We had an agreement. Now, what if I got up in the middle of the night, saw a complete stranger in my refrigerator, and then popped one in his tail. - You'd be in jail, and he'd be in Parkland. - Okay, I'm sorry. It will never happen again. - Wait a minute, Stella, I hear you loud and clear, but what happens the next time you can't hold your alcohol? - Damn. Knew you was gonna say somethin' else. - Look, it's three women livin' in this apartment. What happens when you bring some nutcase home and he decides to do somethin' to all of us, Stella? - For real, Monique? - For real? Yes, for real. I see it on Investigation Discovery all the time, Stella. I take everything into consideration. I don't know about you, but my life is important to me. - Look, we're all room mates. And if this is going to work, then we have to mean what we say, and say what we mean. Stella, there has to be boundaries. - Thank you. - Now with that said, I accept your apology. - And you, Monique? - Look, I am okay with that, I am, but, we all have to be on the same page. - Okay. That settles it. Now, I have somebody I want y'all to meet, and he comin' over here tonight. - Okay, how you gonna be the one? - Really? - I didn't say he's spending the night, Stella. - Oh, okay, because you know y'all be trippin', wanna tell me what to do all the time. - Oh my god, Monique. He'll be here in a minute. Is the food ready? Look at my dress, it's too tight. - Look, you are so nervous, call down. - I feel like I'm back in high school, Monique. - You're not in high school, okay? So just relax, be cool, calm, and collected like you know how to be. - Monique, there is nothing cool, calm, or collected about me. Look at me, I'm shakin' like I have Parkinson's. - You don't have Parkinson's. - Okay, I know you wanted me to meet your new boo and all of that. But girl, I can't let all this go to waste. I gotta keep it warm. Monique, don't be lookin' at me girl, I see you. I'm just playin', I'm just playin'. - Bye Stella. What am I gonna do? - Okay now listen. - I just-- - Ooo, girl. - What is she-- - I think your new boo is out here already. He is a tall drink of water. You need to get up on that and be like, uh uh, and then back, back, back, back. Oh! But you can't. We got the Golden Rule. So boop, leave a message. See y'all. - Okay. - Wait. Did you hear her? He's here. Oh my god, I think I've been married too long. I forgot how to do this. I really did. - You have not. You have not forgotten how to do this. Listen, it's just like riding a bike. Once you learn, you don't forget, okay? So, he's here, we know that. - Oh my god. - Don't keep him waiting. Okay? Go on. You look fine. - I think this dress is too much. - You look great. Okay? Go on. Don't keep him waitin'. - Coron, you made it. - Hello, Gabriele, how are you? - I'm doing great, come on in. You look gorgeous. - Thank you. - Oh, these are for you. - Oh. - What's that smell? Ooo, that's the direction I'm headed. - Just a little something. Let me introduce you to my room mate. Monique. This-- - Oh my god, Coron. What are you doin' here? Gabby, is this the man you were telling me about? This is crazy. - Please tell me you have not slept with him. - No, girl, don't be ridiculous. Coron is a long time family friend, and he's my doctor. - Well thank god. - Coron, no doctor patient talk tonight, okay? Well, I have a ton of studying to do, so I'ma leave you guys to yourself. She's fragile, okay? If you break her, I know where to find you. - I promise, I cross my heart. Look, you what I wanted to say that congratulations are in order for your acceptance into university. Oh thank you. Now you guys have fun. - Okay. I really hope you're hungry. - Oh I'm literally starved. - Well, I made one of my favorite dishes, and it's very special to me. And I'm looking forward to it. You know I like your place here. - Thank you. You know it's tough living with two other people who have their own ideas on decorating and housekeeping, but we manage. I call it... Ghetto country chic. - Yeah. You know, Gabriele, I need to ask you something. When we spoke on the phone the other night, I noticed that you never mentioned your husband's name. Now, I think it's important I know where I stand in all this, so... - Well you never asked, Coron. And I actually planned on talking to you about it tonight after dinner. - You know... I know I'm jumping ahead of myself, so please excuse me, but, it's been a really long time since I've had a strong connection with a woman like I do with you. And it's important that I know what's going on. - And it's been a long time since I've had a connection with a man who's sensitive like you say. ♫ One, two, three, four ♫ Five, six, seven, eight - That's some good shit. Here, take a bump. - Uh uh, I'm a weed girl, I don't do that. - Come on, Stella, everybody does a few miles every now and then. It brings out the animal, you know what I mean? - Are you cold or somethin'? - No. - Then why do you got them gloves on? - H1, the flu goin' around. Man... - Okay, alright, wait. Let's get out, let's get some air. How long you been livin' in Tampa Hills Estates? I'm sayin', I heard you have to have a lot of money to live up in there. - You see this necklace? This bracelet? 9,000 watts, baby, I sparkle and I keeps paper. - Damn, so, how many cars you got? Me, myself, I'm trying to cop this 750 BMW series. I'm like-- Whoa, wait. Damn. I mean, I'm right here, I ain't goin' nowhere. Shit. Bet you like it rough. - I'm just all into you, you dig? Your thick, fine ass. I just wanna bite your booty. Here. Will this make you happy? - Oh. I mean, yeah, I like that. But you think I can get this is lady's size? I'm sayin', I heard the mall is stayin' open late tonight. - See, you just an unappreciative trick who needs some trainin'. - What are you talkin' about? Rue. Get off of me. - Stella, stop, come here. No, nig-- Whoa. What are you doin'? Get your ass, get off of me. Shit. - What have I done? What have I done? Stella, I'm so sorry. It wasn't me, I didn't do it. The voices made me do it. - I know. I know. Don't worry, I know you hear voices. I know your voices made you do it. Rue, I forgive you. - I hear them all the time. They make me do things. Bad things I don't wanna do. - I know, but-- - I'ma take you shoppin', baby. - I know, I know. If you just let me go, just let me go. I understand, I'm gonna help you through this, okay? Okay? It's okay. It o-- And I was gonna give you some with your impatient ass! Now look at you. I'm 9,000 watts now, baby. - It's Monique, it's an emergency. I need to see you. I think I'm sick again. - Monique, we're gonna have to get you back in here for treatments. - Chemotherapy treatments? You said this would go away. - You're going to school for medicine, Monique. You know better than that. Now, I'm sorry. But the cancer's returned and it's spread, and it's spreading at a rapid pace. We have to have it treated now. - Doctor Perry-- - Look, it's been two months since you were here. What's up with that? - Doctor Perry, am I gonna be okay? - Lung cancer, as you know, are treatable. But I won't know for sure until we run more tests to determine where it's spread to, and how much damage it's caused. Once I get those tests back, then I'll know more. - Stop writing. Stop writing. No more treatments. No more pills. I'm tired. My body has been in pain for years, and I am losing my motivation to fight this. - I'm not gonna let you give up, Monique. The treatment to cure this disease is remarkable. But you have to want to fight. - No. Doctor Perry, you are a brilliant doctor, you are. And a wonderful person. But this? This is my decision, my life. We can beat this. We can, we can beat this Monique. - Gee, look at the time. Nice of you to come home. Oh my god, Stella. What happened to you? Who did this? - 9,000 watts. I caught this 9,000 watts and I got my share of the rent. - Oh my god, Stella, we have to call the police right now. - Don't please, don't call, no. No, no, no. He can't get away from this. - No police, no police. It's my problem, I can handle it. - Stella, you can't let him get away with this. Think about it, if you don't report it, he could kill somebody next time. Or he might even come back for you. - Gabby, I have warrants, okay? I have warrants. I got warrants. Are you happy now? You heard it. You heard it. Are you happy now? Are you? - Stella. I'm just concerned, I wanna help. I'm sorry. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. Whoo girl, every time I see you, you're reading or studyn'. What else do you do? - Nothin'. Hey Gabby, what you doin' tonight? - Nothin'. Probably takin' a hot bath, readin' a book. - Oh, well. Some friends and I are goin' to this jazz club to listen to some live music, so you can come if you want to. - Girl, what the hell? What's wrong with her? - You have to promise me not to mention it. - Okay. - I have to have your word. - Okay, I promise, cross my heart, what is it? - She was attacked the other night or somethin'. - Girl, what? Did y'all call the police? - Shh, will you be quiet? What did the police say? - I tried to talk to her. She wouldn't talk to me. And I tried to convinced her to call the police, and she got mad at me and shut me out. - Why, why? - She said she has warrants for her arrest. - Oh my god, girl, she done killed somebody. - Girl no. - Yeah, she look like it. - Well I don't know. Well I have to run a few errands. Do either of you need me to get anything for y'all? No, I'm good. - Okay. See y'all later. - Stella look, I know I'm not your favorite person. I understand that, but we have to live together and this walkin' around each other, it really needs to stop. - Nique, what the hell? What do you want from me? What? Okay, you got my attention. Talk. - Okay, tell me, what did I do? - Oh, how soon we forget. - Forget what? - You don't remember being disrespectful when Daryl came over the other night? - Okay, maybe I should've ran it by you first before I got his help. But I didn't mean anything by it. - Mhm. I know girls that are just like you. Be cool with they home girl one day, goin' behind they backs, sleepin' with they man the next day. But whatever. Go on, I don't even care. Get your car fixed or whatever else you need fixed, fixed. - Hold on, wait a minute. You will not talk to me like that, okay? - Fine. Fine. Maybe it came out wrong, okay? Alright. I'm not saying you, but I do know girls like that. So I should not have insinuated that it was you. But, it is what it is. - Stella, look. I don't want anything that you have, or have had for that matter, okay? And besides, you know I like women anyway. I knew it. - I'm just kidding, I'm kidding. I got jokes, I'm just kidding. Okay? But, if I was... Then you'd be all like... Just kiddin'. - Stop. - Anyway, for real, for real, I don't care nothin' about Daryl, he was just a jump off. - A jump off? - Nevermind, Monique. Look, I'm gonna sit here. I'm gonna relax. I'ma bake these cookies. - Okay. - Okay? Some hoes got yoga, I got these cookies. Okay? So I will name this after you. It will be "Monique's Bunch Box." - Thank you. - You welcome. - Stella, I'm curious about somethin'. Why do you always push out the people who actually care about you? Monique and I are concerned. We're not trying to be all in your business. - Yeah, you guys are just gonna have to help me with this thing. It's just hard for me to open up to people like that. It's like... You know, I ain't really had a lot of people care about me like that, so, when y'all be all up in here, I be thinkin' y'all trying to be fake. - Boo, why do you think we would do that? We're sisters. - Exactly. Monique couldn't have said it any better. We are all connected, we're strong women, and we have each other's back no matter what. - I don't know, y'all, I'm just not used to people being nice to me. Usually if somebody trying to be nice to me, they want somethin' and I ain't got nothin' to give, child. - Now wait a minute. I know we were all raised differently, okay? I get that. But, when people are nice to you, when people are kind to you, when people help you, they don't always have a hidden agenda. - That's absolutely right, Stella. So while we're all talking, let's just put everything on the table. - What you trying to put on the table? - I like to practice what I preach. So there will be no misunderstandings or any hidden agendas. So the other night I was really worried about you, Stella. So I called to get some professional advice. Oh my god, Stella, do somethin', she's chokin'. - Are you alright? - Oh my god. Monique, sweetie, are you okay? Monique, do you need us to call anyone? Monique, please come out of the bathroom, you're starting to freak me out. - Girl, you think she got AIDs? - Stella, stop, this is serious. - AIDs is real serious, that's why I'm askin'. - I'm sorry y'all, for ruinin' the mood. But... I have an illness that I need to talk to you guys about. - Stop being silly, are you okay? - Girl, you sure know how to kill somebody's buzz and scare them, all at the same time. - I know I ruined the mood, and I'm sorry. The one night we get to spend some quality time together, my illness takes the fun out of everything. But in all honestly, it has taken everything out of me. - Mhm, girl. AIDs? Don't worry about it. I got this homegirl who had AIDs. But then, really, it was kinda like herpes, but I know it's like the same thing, so-- - I have cancer, crazy girl. Lung cancer. - My bad. - Okay? I was diagnosed, about... Two and a half years ago. It's been in remission, but, it's come back. - Wow. Monique, you are really strong and brave. - Girl, why you didn't tell us you was sick? - And how was that gonna help my condition? - I mean, like I just wouldn't be comin' at you like that, all hard, you know what I'm sayin'? - That's the very reason why I didn't wanna say anything. Look, I'm not helpless, I'm not dependent, okay? I can hold my own. - Monique, we are just concerned and want to help. - If you wanna help me, if you really want to help me, then pray for me, okay? Just pray for me. God has got this. - Girl, you know what? I ain't talked to the old JC in a while, but, I'll make sure to send one up for you. Good morning, ladies. - Morning. - Good morning. How are you today? - Good. - I heard you had a pretty frightening moment the other night. - Coron, let me tell you what happened. We were all just sittin' around, you know, talkin' and relaxin' and havin' a girls night, and then there was blood everywhere. - Gabby, stop, okay. I can give my own symptoms. You're exaggerating anyway, there was no blood, okay? I know you mean well, but, Gabby now, she thinks she's mother hen, so... - I'm sorry. - Okay. - It seems that your red blood count is low and I'm, you know, I'm curious. Are you continuing to take the meds I prescribed you? - No, I haven't. I left them, remember? We've already talked about this. - Monique, how do you expect to get any better? - Gabby can you give me a minute? I just need some privacy for right now. - Okay. Go downstairs. - Doctor Perry, how long have you known my family? - Well, let's see, middle school, high school, college, med school. Maybe 15 years. - Right. Then you know we are a proud people and we don't take hand outs from anyone. My dad taught me that before he died. - I remember Mr. Bailey. But who's offering handouts here? Pride was something Mr. Bailey had. And that's why I know his only daughter's giving up. - I'm not giving up. I'm not giving up. I don't have any money, I'm broke. I do not have any money, and I cannot, I cannot, tell my mother. She has enough on her plate already. I'm sorry. - It's Dr. Perry here. I'd like to place an order for a prescription, please. - Coron. - Gabriele. - Hi. What a surprise. Gabriele, how are you? - Good. - Look, I just wanted to drop something off for Monique. I don't normally make house calls, but I wanted to make sure she got it. - Come on in. You want some coffee or somethin'? Monique's not here. - No, I gotta get back to the hospital. I just wanted to make sure she got these. There's six months of meds here, so I really would like for-- Monique. How are you? - Fine. - You know, I was just dropping these six months of meds off. - No, doctor, Coron-- - Don't get all defensive, please. I'm doing this for your grandmother. It's the least I can do for all the wonderful things they've done for me over the years. Take the meds. Six months of meds here. Take the meds. And look after yourself, okay? And Gabriele. I'll see you again, soon. - Okay. You like him, don't you? - No. I mean... Why you ask? - 'Cause it's obvious. "Oh Coron, oh Coron." "Gabriele, I'll see you soon." Oh whatever, take your meds. - Girl, what are you studyin'? You have been at it all day. - Girl, philosophy. Oh, and it is kickin' my butt. - Dang. I bet you gotta be smart to study philosophy. - Smart? No. It's just one of the many classes I have to take to get this degree. - I read a book. - You read a book? What? - Bitch, shut up, I can read. - I'm sorry. - Um, it was... Ah-ri, Aries, or somethin' or other? - Aristotle? - Hell yeah. Girl that was him, he was deep. He be like, um, "friends to everyone..." - "Is a friend to none." - Yes. And I was like, that shit is so true, because bitches be like grinnin' all up in your face and everything and them bitches be two faced. - Girl, damn Stella, come do my homework. You makin' fun of me? - I'm sorry. - Thank you. But for real though, no, I wish I could do that. You know, like it would be like rewarding. High school is as far as it went for me. - You can, Stella. I can help get you back in school. Listen, you can always get an eduction, or, like some people you can always learn a trade. - Ah, Monique, girl. I ain't been in school in years. - Tell you what, come with me tomorrow, we'll go talk to a counselor. It wouldn't hurt. - Tomorrow... I'm busy tomorrow, I ain't gonna be able to do that. - Okay, Friday then. - Fri-- Girl, Friday you know I be gettin' my hair did. - Girl, what are you so afraid of? You got what it takes. You just got through quoting Aristotle. - Girl, ain't nobody afraid of nothin', and he ain't nobody. - "You will never do anything "in this world without courage." - "It is the greatest thing in the mind "next to honor." I know, shut up. - See, see Stella. You got this. Listen, come with me tomorrow, we'll get you registered. It'll be easy, it'll be a piece of cake. - Monique, stop. Don't push this, okay? Please. - Okay fine, I'm just trying to help. I think you're makin' a mistake, but, I'm not gonna push it. Hey, girl. What are you doin' here? - Girl, old Aries said, "happiness depends on ourselves." And I've given it some thought. I need to make some changes in my life, and, ain't nobody gonna take care of me but me. So I'm here. - Oh girl, I am so proud of you. Now you know you makin' the right decision, right? - Monique, girl, I am scared. What if I can't do this? - Girl, "we are what we repeatedly do." - "Excellence then is not an act, but habit." - See, you do know more Aristotle than you do 2Pac. - Girl, it's just me against the world baby. Got nothin' to lose, just me against the world. I ain't went that far, girl. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. It's your husband. I know I told you to bring your ass home. I was dead ass serious about that, alright? Put a rush on this damn message. Where could she be, where could she be? I know you ain't givin' away my cookie. Where you at? I need some of this damn pie. I'm about to lose my mind, up in here, up in here. She gone learn to respect me. Dammit, Lord, thank you for this food I'm about to receive. In Jesus name, if I don't kill her, amen. Alright, baby. Quit playin'. You know I want you to be home. I got some sweet potato thing. The crust if off the chain. I wanna feed ya. Call me back. Right now. Oh, okay, now you ignorin' my phone call. I need you to call me. I need you to call me. Where you at? Huh? You better call me back, or I'ma choke the shit out yo ass. It's not a threat, it's a promise. - Are you expecting someone? - Mm mm. - How you doin', ma'am? My name is Detective Sweeney, are Miss Stella Henderson? No, I'm not, but she is. - May I come in for a minute and speak with her? - Yeah, come in. Stella, there's a detective here to see you. - How are you doin' Miss Stella, my name is Detective Sweeney with the Dallas Police Department. I'm here following up on a tip. - Tip? What tip? - We received a call from Gabriele saying that there was an attack on you. - Oh my god, Gabby, I'm gonna kill her. I don't have time for this. Please, Miss Henderson, don't-- - Just call me Stella. - Okay, Stella. Please don't be mad at Miss Gabriele. She was just, you know, concerned about you. To be honest, there's been a lot of rapes in this city. And you were fortunate enough to get away. - Well... His name is Rue, is that enough? - Unfortunately ma'am, no, I need you to come down to the station with me and identify some photos. - Man, Monique. - I'm sorry. - James, get off my arm. - Hey, hey, listen, why you ain't been returning my phone calls, man? Huh? You ain't got no damn relatives here. Who the hell you stayin' with? - None of your business. What you need to be worried about is that trick you had in my bed. - Listen, the only thing I can do is say I'm sorry. I was poppin' the mollies and shit, you know how shit can get, man. You know, it's industry shit. - Why James? Huh? Didn't I cook for you? Didn't I clean your house when it was dirty? Gave you sex every time you wanted it. I mean, excuse me, James, if I'm wrong. Forgive me if I'm not makin' sense, but, what exactly did I do? - Hey man, what we need to do is forget all this shit. I need you to go ahead and get your shit and bring your ass on back to the house. - I'm not forgettin' nothin', I'm leavin'. James, quit. - I'm gonna choke the shit out your ass. I will kill you right here on the spot. I'll kill your ass right here on the spot. - Let me go, I swear to God. - Hey, can I help you with your bags? - I don't need your kind of help. My Salvation Army days are over with you. - Come on Tammy, please, can we at least talk about this? - What is it you wanna say? - Okay. I just wanted to apologize for everything. I never meant for any of that stuff to happen. And I love my niece so much. And I need you to know and understand that-- - Are you done? - Well, I guess I am. - Now let me tell you one damn thing. I don't give a shit about your apology and how much you claim to love my daughter. - Come on, Tammy, I'm trying to apologize to you here. What do you want from me? - It doesn't matter what I want, Stella. You can't give it to me. All you bring with you is trouble. And for your family, it's double. - Tammy, I'm trying to apologize to you. Now, I'm going above and beyond myself by apologizing. You know I don't normally be apologizin' over and over again. - Really, Stella? This is how you gonna come at me after all you've done? After you done traumatized my daughter? You still think somebody's supposed to be concerned with what your ass feel? You still expect somebody to give a shit about what you concerned with? And what you feelin'? - You know what? You know what? Okay. You need to stop cursin' at me. And you need to watch how you handlin' me. I mean, chill out with all that shit. What the hell? Are you trying to push my buttons? - How 'bout I'm trying to push you to understand that I don't give a shit? My daughter don't give a shit. As a matter of fact, nobody I can think of give a shit about you, what you sayin', how you feel, and how many times you apologize for just being you. - Screw it. Alright. You want me to act like myself? You wanna know the truth? - Yes, finally, the truth Stella, what? - Fine, here it is. What happened to Dawn was horrible, but she is a little girl, and she will grow up, and she will forget. So you can save the angry mama drama for somebody else. And guess what Tammy? Didn't shit happen, and almost doesn't count. So if you expect me to keep walkin' around here and lick your Payless boot heels for the rest of our lives, then you can cancel that, too. But let me tell you what I'm not gonna do. I'm not gonna keep talkin' about it. I'm not gonna keep apologizing for it, 'cause I'm done with it. - You better be glad you my sister, 'cause I will slap your face right now. - Right. What, Tammy? What? - After 23 years, I have... - What? - I haven't forgotten about mama workin' late and daddy comin' into my bedroom. Good bye, Stella. - Wait, you can't leave after that. What did daddy do? - Since I was 12 years old, Stella. And I didn't forget. And she'll never forget. And I promised myself that if I ever had a daughter, she would never feel the pain that I felt. But thanks to you, I guess I couldn't stop that from happening. - No, no, no, Tammy, wait, I'm sorry. Tammy, I didn't know. Tammy, I didn't know, I'm sorry. Tammy, I'm... - Hey Dr. Perry... Coron, hey, it's Gabriele. Yeah, everything's fine with Monique. She's taking her medicine. But listen, that's not why I called. Look, do you think we cold meet up for coffee or somethin'? I really need somebody to talk to. Okay, well I'll see you soon. - There she goes. - Shit, it's cold. Come here. Come here. - Damn, Sweeney, why you sweatin' me? I'm just out for a walk, that ain't against the law. Get your hands off me. Get your ass in the car. Come here. - Get in the car? - Get in the car. Come on, hurry up. Get your feet down. Respect my car, get your feet down. - Okay, chill. - Now look, we can do this two ways. Either you can do what the hell I tell you to do, or I'ma haul your ass in for not reportin' for the past two months. The way I see it, that'll be strike three for you, right? - Damn, Sweeney. - Automatic straight jail time. - Give a sista a break. I was gonna call you. See, my son, he been real-- - I don't give a damn about your personal problems. And I don't care about your son, neither. You know what? This is what I need you to do. You know this cat they call Rue? - Yeah, I know Rue. He crazy. - Crazy? What you mean crazy? - Word is he beat up one of his girls with a pipe in front of her mom's house. Broke her up real bad. Messed up jaw, everything. - You see this Rue? He done raped several women in this city. But you gonna help me catch him. See, I need this lieutenant position as much as your ass need to stay out of jail. - Whoa, Rue picks the wings off of flies for fun. I can't be dealin' with no crazy people like that. See my son, he-- - Look, I don't... You know what? Where my cuffs at, because, it seems like your ass like jail over freedom. - Wait. - I'm about to find some dope on you, huh? - Wait. - A lot. 'Cause your ass wanna go to jail. I'ma go ahead and take you-- - No, wait, wait, wait. What you need me to do? - First off, sit back. That's more like it. Now you see this alley back here? Fuck. Fuck is he at? Where the fuck? - Yeah, you know just how I like it, huh? - Oh yeah, I'm about to take real good care of you, daddy. - What the fuck? Bitch, you set me up. Wait, Rue, wait, wait. Let me explain, let me explain. Ain't nothin' to explain. Rue, wait, wait! - No, I ain't about to take the wrap for this. You alright? No. - You okay? ♫ For you I would fly a million miles ♫ To see your face and your smile ♫ The taste of love is on your lips ♫ I'd give all I have ♫ For another sip ♫ For you ♫ I'd swim the seven seas ♫ For you ♫ I'd give anything ♫ For your heart - The rain is really coming down. Thank you so much for a wonderful night, Coron, I mean, it's been so long since I've had that much fun. - I'm glad you enjoyed it. We should do it again soon. - I got a gun! I got a gun! - Oh, whoa, ooo. You got me about to piss on my damn self. I can't believe you done shot at me. - Bang, bang. - Ooo. Listen, this is absolutely, irrevocably not funny. You know what's not gonna be funny, James? - What? - What I'ma do if you don't get the hell out of my house. Next time, I won't miss. - I can't believe your black ass. - James, get out. It's over. - Alright, we done. Yeah, it's over. I can't stand ya. I smelt your draws. - James, get out of my house. How he got in? What the hell is goin'-- Whoa, hey, hey, my bad. What's goin' on? - Is he gone? - Uh, I guess so, ain't nobody in there. What is goin' on? See, I need... I, shit. May I help you? Everything okay in here? Yeah - You sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. What are you doin' with a fork? Yeah, I'm sure. It got a little crazy inn here, but we okay. - Now you know we don't play no mess over here. This is a respectable place. I can have you thrown out for disturbing the peace. - Like I said, everything is fine, and we're okay. So good bye and good night. - Well good night to you, too, scarin' the crap out of me. You almost made me mess my pants. - You know that boo boo was already there. - Oh, you're this close, young lady. You're this close. "For we fight not against flesh and blood, "but we fight against..." Well, you know what I'm talkin' about. Read your Bible, good night. - I don't know what the hell you talkin' about, but I know that was some voodoo. Don't you come up in here. What is he talkin' about some flesh? Did anybody see that? He gone kill us. - Coron, is my baby gonna pull through this time? She seems to be giving up hope and that frightens me. - Well Ms. Bailey, Monique is seriously ill. And I'm continuing to run tests and I'm gonna do all that I can. But you have to know that her body's rejecting the prescriptions I'm giving her. - Rejecting it? What does that means? Does that mean that there's no hope? That she's gonna die? - Ms. Bailey, I have a real close associate in Boston that's a specialist. And he's agreed to give us all the help that we need. We're gonna fight this. - You know, when you were a little boy, Coron, I used to watch you and all the neighborhood kids play. Monique was too small to keep up with y'all, but you always slowed down so she could catch up. And my husband and I used to sit on the porch and laugh. You're just as caring now as you were then. I know without a doubt that you'll do all you can for my Monique. - Yes, ma'am. - Look, man, I already told you guys, don't no Jose live here. - No, I'm sorry. I'm looking for Tammy, does she live here? - Quieres usted? - Huh? - Who are you? - Oh. I'm Stella, I'm Tammy's sister. Is she here? - Well, I don't know no Tammy but, mi nombre es Jose. - Oh. - I live here for six months. - Okay, I'm sorry, I must have the wrong house. - Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. You can come in. Si, es Jose. - Uh uh. - Come on. - I don't wanna see no Jose. Touchin' on me, no. Touchin' me. Bet you understand that. I don't know what I said. - Oh, so close. - Is my mail missin' on his hand? Yes. Do I care? No. 'Cause that ain't got nothin' to do with my joke, 'cause I am a comedian, but actually, I was in the slow class, I ain't gonna lie. 'Cause you know, I done already graduated the statute of limitations of bringing it out. So I like your tie. - Oh man. So what do you do? - I'm a detective with the Dallas Police Department. Nice. Something catch your eye? - No. Sorry, give me a minute. - Comedy shows, I usually take my hat off to y'all for bein' an awesome audience, but since I ain't wearin' my hat, then I'll take my hair off. Y'all give it up to my co-host. - Freeze. You're under arrest for sexual assault. You have the right to remain silent. - What you want with me, man? You're just as dirty as me. - What? - I saw what you did to her. - Man, shut up. It's little young punks like you been havin' me go crazy for the past 20 years. But like the rest of 'em, you ain't gettin' away. You're gonna be my ticket up and out. - Shh, shh. Look at me. I'm beautiful. I ain't got to rape nobody. These hoes just need a little convincin'. 9000 watts, I sparkle. - Damn, what the hell is going on? Where's the fire? - Girl that was Rue's crazy ass runnin'. Somebody gonna kill him one day. If he ain't stabbin' or shootin' folks, he out here rapin' women. That's why I keep my piece on me at all times. Try to rape me and I'ma shoot that third leg off. - I know that's right girl. Why that fool ain't in jail? - Girl, you ain't heard? He and his goons got the whole neighborhood scared to talk. Last year, a girl was in the Witness Protection Program. What good that did her. She was found dead, burned in an apartment. Go figure. - Unbelievable. - Tammy, girl. I gotta keep it 100 with you. You must not know 'cause you too damn calm. - Know what? - Stella ain't told you? - Yvette, what's the deal? Now you know Stella and I ain't been talkin'. - Well I ain't tryin' to get in nobody's business or nothin', but I heard from Fat Faye, and you know don't nothin' happen in the hood that she don't know about, but anyways, she said that word on the street is, Rue raped Stella not too long ago. - What? Yvette, you tellin' me that my sister was raped by that dog? Are you sure about this? - Yep, yeah, I'm sure. Fat Faye be gossipin', but her gosspin' don't be lies. That fat bitch is the ghetto CNN. Them stories be the truth. Girl, you alright? - I'm gonna need you to help me do somethin'. - Alright. Anything for you, I got you. - Dammit. Shit. - I just don't understand why she didn't call me and tell me she was sick again. I've never seen her this bad before and it scares me. - Ms. Bailey, I just think Monique didn't wanna worry you. She was so worried about disappointing you, that I think she just ignored the facts. It took her havin' an episode in front of me and Stella to even mention she was sick. - She's too strong and independent, just like her father. I'd be proud of her no matter what she does. - I'm just really glad Monique and I became friends. And she's had such an impact on Stella's life, Ms. Bailey. I mean, I really think if it wasn't for Monique, Stella would've never thought about going to college. - That's my baby. Always worrying about helping somebody else no matter what's goin' on with her. - That's Monique. You sleepin'? - No. - Okay. You feelin' okay? - I've had much better days, mama. - Okay. Okay, can I get you anything to eat or drink? - No, mom. No, I'm fine. Gabby, do you remember that restaurant, Mama's and Daughters' Diner? - Yeah, but it's been months since we've eaten there. - You need to take mom there. I think she'd love the food. - Well why don't we just call in a pick up order and I'll stay here with Monique until you get back? - No, no, no. You've been cooped up in the house, you need to get you some fresh air. - Alright. We'll be back soon. Love you, sweetie. Love you, too. - Okay. - There are many ways we can remember Monique. We can remember her as a brilliant student. We can remember her humor, her glamorous ways. Mostly, though, we can remember her as committed friend, and as a devoted granddaughter. - We are here today to celebrate life, not death. I know before us, lyin' in this casket, is the remains of Sister Bailey. But this is where Sister Bailey used to live, because the real Sister Bailey, which is her soul, has gone on to be with the lord in Heaven. So Sister Bailey, we are here to say to the family, that, you don't have to be sad, because your child has gone on to be with the Lord. For every last one of you who know Jesus, as Lord and savior, you too, will have the opportunity to be reunited with your loved one in heaven. - Monique. I'm really gonna miss her. - You know, I'm just grateful to God for the few years Monique had on this Earth. - You know, Mrs. Bailey, I just thank God for our friendship. I feel really blessed. And I know it's gonna kill Stella when she finds out. I just hate I couldn't get in touch with her, you know? She missed the beautiful service, and of course she didn't get to meet you. - I'm just thankful to God that she met you two young ladies. Thank you for loving my Monique. - Oh, Ms. Bailey. You don't have to thank me. - I'll be back to get the rest of her things tomorrow. - Okay. - Alright. - Be careful. - Stand up for a second. - Now this right here? Is a proper way to set it off. Not every day I get a pair of fine ass coups. - You know that's right, baby. - No offense. Look at you, girl. Take off my tank. - Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute, baby, what's the rush? We got all night to get to know each other. Matter of fact, I brought body oils and candles. Why don't you just relax, and let me and my girl take care of you? Yvette, you're makin' us some drinks, right? - I got you, girl. - Y'all some real freaks. That's what I'm talkin' about. - Thank you. - Damn, you look familiar. - Really? - Damn that shit good. So what's up? - Coron, I'm sorry I'm late. Good to see you. Why this restaurant of all places? - Well you know, I like the pie here, and you like the pie here, so why not? - Honey, you know I love the pie. - Yes. Let me talk to you for a second. - What's up? - You know, I've been... Where do I begin? I am part of an international group of doctors who have been researching a cure for cancer. - Wow. - And for the last 10 years, I've dedicated my life to this cause. I even promised my wife that, somehow, one day, we'd find a cure. Well... To make a long story short, I am leaving for South Africa next week. - What? South Africa? - Look, I should've been gone two months ago, but, I wanted to look after Monique and, then I met you. - I... I guess I really don't understand. This is so sudden, Coron. I mean, of course do what God has called you to do, but why all the way in South Africa? - There's a great group of doctors there headed up by my younger brother Brendan, and, they've had a remarkable breakthrough. And they need me in the program. - Well, um... You go to South Africa and make a difference. We'll keep in touch. No hard feelings, always friends, right? - You know what? I have a brilliant idea. Why don't you come to South Africa with me? You would love it. - Coron, I, I can't go to South Africa. I mean, don't you know what you're asking me to do? I mean, I have to admit, a part of me wants to just leave and never come back, but... It's just right now, I feel like I need to do me. We'll keep in touch, and if it's meant to be then... We'll cross that bridge when it comes. - You know what? I'll wait. I'll wait for you. - I hope so. - And how are you folks doing today? Great. - Hey, I remember you two. Ma'am, we got that apple pie for you tonight, ma'am. - Alright now. - Can we get two slices and a cup of coffee? Comin' right up. - Aw, yeah, you real kinky. Let's get this party started. - This ain't that kind of party, fool. - Trick, you steal my gloves? Untie me. I said untie me, bitch. - So, tell me, big man. How does it feel to be taken advantage of, huh? Don't feel good to have your control away, now does it? - You dead, trick, you know that, don't you? - Is that what you tell all the women you rape? You are pathetic. - Well that depends, on if it's business or personal, and if they resist me or not. - What I'm about to do to you is personal. I bet you don't even remember my sister, Stella, or any of the other women you've violated. - Stella? Stella, Stella. Yeah, how can I forget that sweet brown thang. I can still smell and taste her now. The way she cried out turned me on even more. - Shut your mouth. - Ay, if you want me to beat that thing up, just ask. You ain't gotta go about it like this. Shit, all you hoes are the same. Now untie me. - Get mad, Rue, that's exactly what I want you to do. But you know what? If I were you, I'd save my energy, 'cause I'm about to get medieval on your ass. Yes? - Is everything okay in here? I got reports that there was screamin' comin' from this room. - Yeah, everything's okay, sir. We're so sorry. My husband and I are celebratin' our one year anniversary, and I guess we were havin' so much fun we didn't even notice all the noise we were making. I'm so embarrassed. - Oh, don't be, ma'am. Over the 20 years I've worked here, I've seen and heard it all. You know, one time this man had an alligator and he put it in-- - Hey girl. I don't even... Know where to start. I'm sorry I didn't make it to your funeral. I was... Searchin' for Tammy. I didn't know that you were... How could I have known? I mean... I miss you. I really miss you. I don't know what I'm gonna do without you, girl. I don't have nobody to argue with. I brought these for you. ♫ There's so much to say ♫ In so many ways ♫ I won't let it go Just to think... It's crazy.

I can't believe she gone. - I know, right? You know what else I can't believe? - What? - You got her those flowers. - What's wrong with those flowers? - They, just, they look ashy. - My flowers look ashy? I'ma tell you what's ashy. That hairstyle is ashy. Your man go to Africa, and then that's what you do? - I thought it was a good time to go back to my roots. - Then you should've went back to Africa with him. Don't nobody do that over here. - You know what? - How you go from long and flowin', to that? Oh, you just gonna walk off? That's why you need to be here, because she's out of control. I love you girl. Find a ride home.

Young lady, you are late for my class. - I'm sorry. - Please have a seat. Take a syllabi, keep one for yourself and pass one to the other. There is a dirty rumor going around that Socrates was a genius. He was not. Plato, I do not like him. Aristotle, who is that? Philosophy comes from the mouth of only one man in this universe, and that is Lil' Wayne, ladies and gentlemen. And it comes from a long line of lils'. Lil' Kim, Lil' Jeezy, Lil' Mo, Lil' Mama, Lil' Bow Wow and, the notorious and one and only, Lil' Flip. Yes, ma'am? - Okay, for Jeezy, you need to put a young in front of it, 'cause he's not Lil' Jeezy, he's Young Jeezy. And on the lil's, you gotta add Jon. - Oh, we gonna learn from each other today. - Yeah. - You are fancy. Young Jeezy, is a synonym for little. Because when you are young, you are little. And I will, yes, yes, and I will put Lil' Jon right there. - Yeah. - One of the greatest of all time. That's right. Yes, sir? It's got an H in it, right? - Because, he has six letters in his name for a reason dependin' on his album cover, and he is a member of the Illuminati! And also, he is Nigerian, just in case you did not know. And Nigerians do not spell their Jons with an H. That's right. - Or the gods will kill you. Yes.
