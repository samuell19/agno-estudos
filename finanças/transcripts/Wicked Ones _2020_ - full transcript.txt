(ominous music) Looking back on the horrific events that happened on your family farm, do you ever worry that they never found the body? It's a fear I live with every day. Hmm. Speaking of fear, do you also fear that he may come after you? You know, for some type of revenge or retaliation? (sighs) I personally don't. Total random act of violence. - Mm-hmm. - Could have been anyone. Just so, it happened to be us. Wrong place, wrong time, but totally random. You know, there is a big hysteria about what happened to you guys And Adam, it's, it's interesting that you talk about random acts of violence. It wasn't long ago, I was reading some material that talked about out, sometimes violence incites more violence. Do you think that the actions of Colin Miller would inspire more acts of random violence? I would hope that wouldn't be the case, but in today's society, people do tend to feed off negative energy. - Mm. - So while I hope that doesn't happen, I could see where others could tap into the darkness that possessed Colin Miller. It's a scary world we live in. (crickets chirping) (suspenseful music) This is it. Don't be chickenshit. Come on. We've talked about this for days. Myles, you're scared of your own fucking shadow. I am not, Maddy. No going back now. No going back. I wonder if there'll be a lot of blood. Hopefully. (Myles chuckles) (toothbrush scraping) (Mr. Mathis snorting) (Mr. Mathis spits and grunts) Is it necessary to always make that noise every time you brush your teeth? What's up with the kids? What do you mean? Eh, there's something off. (scoffs) Look who their father is. There's always gonna be something off. They barely said a word all evening. Yeah, they're probably just tired from playing. (suspenseful music) (toothbrush scraping) (shower spraying) (Mr. Mathis whistling) (faucet running) (footsteps thudding) - Maddy. Shit! I almost my pissed my pants. Why aren't you in bed? (suspenseful music) Maddy? Are you okay? Never better. (knife slicing) (Mr. Mathis groaning) (intense music) That's it. (groaning) Myles! Maddy! (knives stabbing) (Mr. Mathis groaning) (flesh squelching) (Mr. Mathis groaning) Honey? (suspenseful music) (blood dripping) (Mrs. Mathis gasping) Oh my God! J.P? Oh, oh my God! (gasping) (Mrs. Mathis screams) 911. What's your emergency? (Mrs. Mathis mutters hysterically) Somebody's killed him! Please! - Ma'am, I need you to stay on the line. - Please help me! Attention all units we have a... (Maddy screams) (knife stabs) 1034 in progress. (body thuds) (Mrs. Mathis groaning) Ma'am, ma'am, are you all right? (Mrs. Mathis gasping) I need to know where you are. - Maddy! (gasping) - What should we do with her? - No! - Hello? Make her squeal like a bitch. (Mrs. Mathis muttering hysterically) (Mrs. Mathis screams and gasps) (dramatic theme music) Rita Wanayo with Channel 26, and we are standing in front of the home on Poplar Bluff Road in the small town of Carpenter Falls, where police have just taken into custody two young children who have allegedly committed a series of ritualistic murders. Sadly, this is not the first time this town has seen tragedy. (sirens wailing) I am being informed by authorities that these crimes may have been influenced by those of Colin Miller, a notorious serial killer known to many as The Wicked One. (intense music) (chattering on police radio) (Colin laughing maniacally) (Colin laughing maniacally) (Colin laughing maniacally) (woman screaming) (insects chirping) (crows cawing) (birds chirping) Minnesota. (upbeat rock music) Dad, we stopped playing miles ago. Well it still counts. Just cuz you guys are so losers doesn't mean anything. This drive is taking forever. If the Nova was a busted, I could have been there hours ago. Is that complaining I hear back there? Yeah, I do believe it is. And how many times did your father tell you to stay up-to-date on your oil changes? It's so lame that at 17 years old, I have to get a ride with my parents to a gig. But honey, we love taking you to your gigs. - It's embarrassing. - Not for us. I'm gonna tear Valentine's head off when I see his Joey Ramone wanna-be ass. Daniel, there is no way that Valentine would've known that your car was gonna kerplunk because of your negligence. Do you think GG All in ever had to drive to CBGB's with his parents? Well, considering his father was a religious freak who named his son Jesus Christ, uh, you know, beat him, threatened murder and bury him in cellar, I'm gonna have to take a wild guess and say no. Impressive knowledge of punk rock there, good sir. (chuckles) I'm not as old as lame as Daniel thinks I am. Mm, nah, you're still pretty lame. (chuckles) Hey, don't forget who taught you the chords to "Holiday in Cambodia." Yeah, yeah. (sighs) How much further? About 22 more Taylor Swift tracks, honey. (Kendall sighs) - Daddy? - Yes, Snoops? Did Taylor Swift's dad threaten to kill her too? No, hon. The music world is not that lucky (suspenseful music) I'm gonna go get the key. All right. This definitely isn't the Four Seasons. (chuckles) You know your father, anything to save a buck, but we are a mile from the venue, so you know, that's good. - We're a mile away? - Yeah. And there's cell service. Thank God. Oh, let's go to the vending machine. Okay, we'll be back. (suspenseful music) - Hello, Earth to Mother. Can you pass me in my bag? Your bag, yeah. Here. (traffic whirring) (trunk beeping) (trunk closes) (indistinct chattering) (knocks on door) You're still staring at the board, hey, Burke? Tromer. Come on in. I was just dropping off the report you requested, sir. Hmm? Oh, desk's fine. What's it say? Sir? The report. Oh, uh, some lady on the outskirts of town called in and said that some homeless man was going through her trash. And then she changed her story and it was a Bigfoot. Mm-hmm, and what do you think? Ah, if I had to guess, I'd, I'd say a bear. Do you know how many people have died at the hands of Colin Miller? - Colin Miller is dead. (book slams) So show me his body. It's been 10 years. Four murders in the past 24 months, nine missing persons cases from surrounding counties, all unsolved. And all unrelated, different motives, different causes of death. Hell, we caught the guy who did one of them. It was the boyfriend. That one was circumstantial and you know it, All of these crimes encircle Carpenter Falls. He's out there. Where, I don't know, but he's out there. (Burke sighs) (upbeat theme music) Today, we have got a marvelous guest. Oh, I'm just so excited. I wanna talk about the best selling author with her hit, "The Carpenter Falls Murders: The story of Colin Miller." Yes, look, The National Book Club, an official selection. Whoop-whoop! - Thank you. - Oh yes, I'm just... - Thank you for having me. Yes. I just wanna dive right in. Can we just do that? - The story of Carpenter Falls - Mm, yes. - Is a tragic one. - Mm. - Okay, this is a town that has been marred with horrifying events and there are a lot of unanswered questions. - Ooh. - My book - Mm. - Dives deep into the story and uncovers facts about the occult, the ritualistic blood sacrifices. Turn it. (chattering on TV) - What are you doing? - Getting into character. - Those people online were right, you are a poser. - Uncovered the truth about - What? - The disappearances. - Someone said I was a poser? Kendall, cool it with the jumping. I think it's best if you not do that. [Woman On TV] Am I the only one who thinks going into a terrain - Poser. [Woman On TV] we know nothing about without any knowledge of its conditions or schematics, - Okay. - A little bit intimidating? - Yeah, you know, I'd follow you into hell... (Jenna clears throat) But with this... Um... How do I look? - Honey, it's... - My Mom will kill me. [Woman On TV] Well, as it turns out, we might have a guide. - Revealing. [Woman On TV] Mia Bates, Helen Bates's daughter. - Oh my God. - We're gonna track her down. Daniel, are you ready? Ready as I'm ever gonna be. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow your role, guys. Where are you going? - I've seen this movie before. We're gonna get attacked by some backwoods hillbillies. Well, we're just gonna walk it to the venue. Now? But it doesn't start for several hours. Right. The band's already there and we have rehearsals. But I wanted us all to go get something to eat tonight. [Woman On TV] This seems legitimately dangerous. Oh, Mexican? We need more queso. - Oh God, no queso. - Come on guys. You stick your grubby little fingers in it, nobody can have any. Yeah, pass. - Fuck it. - I'll just get something at the venue. - Let's do it. I'm sure they'll have concessions. Yeah, I'll probably just grab a Power Bar. Don't eat anything to big before my performance. - Be careful. - Of course. It's cool. We get it. You two be careful. I am not comfortable with this. Geez, Mom, we're 17 and 18 years old. And 17 And 18 year olds go missing all the time, Daniel. Alex. (ambient music) Fine, but straight to the venue. Do you understand? - Mm-hmm. - Yep. - Yeah. They'll be fine. They got each other. The three of us will go get something to eat. Someplace with queso? Child, you're obsessed. [Woman On TV] Stopped answering my calls and you clearly didn't take my hint. They'll be good. Okay? [Woman On TV] Look, I know what you're thinking, and no, I don't live here. It's just somewhere I come when I need to get away. Clear my head. (birds chirping) (soft guitar music) - Boo, you suck! - Well, well, well. I thought I was gonna have to Phil Collins this shit tonight. Hey, hey. - Hmm. Do you even know who that is? Of course I know who that is. - Hmm. - "No Jacket Required" was required listening in my household growing up. The old man loved that Limey bastard. Dude, the Nova totally keeled over. - Fuck. - Hopefully we have a decent crowd tonight. I could use the fucking money. - Mm. - And by the way, thanks for leaving me behind, dick. Well, don't be so damn late. I don't know, man. The dude said the pre-sales were actually pretty rad, so we might have a full house tonight. Ooh, don't tell him that. He's had the bubble guts the whole way here. Well, I didn't think you were even gonna be here, work or something. - Mm, totally charmed my way out of it. - Mm? - Mm-hmm. - Well you picked a pretty good one. I can feel it coming in the air tonight. Yes, that is an intentional Phil Colland reference. - Mm. - Mm. And the only pretty girl is gonna be showing some support. - Holly. - Hi. - Hey, how are you? - Good. Thank God we made it. If I had to hear Holly mention Daniel's name one more time, I was going to slip my own throat. (Jenna laughs) How you doing today? You good? Good. Are you nervous? Yeah, Pike said it's gonna be a full house, so... That's good for y'all, though. - Yeah. - It'll be fun, it looks like a good venue. - Yeah, it's really cool. I love all the lights. It's cool. I'm excited. Me too. Thanks for coming. Yeah, I mean, Jenna would have killed me if I didn't come, so... - Yeah. - I'm glad you came. - Yeah, uh, me too. (chuckles) (suspenseful music) You know, I've driven more crazies across the Midwest than I care to mention. Hell, I'll be happy when they transfer my ass in a couple weeks. - You and me both. Having to listen to your crabby-ass on these trips is excruciating. Uh, come on, man. Twisted clown killers. Crazy ex-lovers. Just about every other flavor of insane you could imagine. It's like a Baskin-Robbins for loonies. So do you actually think that these two did it? What, kill their folks? - Yeah. - I mean, the rumor is that Miller fuck made 'em do it. The kids were scary. Gives me the heebie-jeebies even thinking about it. (intense music) (crickets chirping) I have nightmares all the time about my son killing me in my sleep. - (chuckles) I would too. That creepy little bastard. Ever since I seen him, I knew you were fucked. (both chuckles) (woman screaming) (body slams) Oh, shit! (tires screeching) Oh, holy fuck, man! Was that a woman? Shit! Wait in the van! (suspenseful music) (crickets chirping) Jesus. What happened to you, lady? (man screams) (suspenseful music) Hello? What the fuck? (gun fires) (man choking) (body thuds) (door opens) (Maddy laughing) They're dead! (laughing) Oh! (intense music) (crickets chirping) (Myles grunting) (distorted voice) That's the most terrifying thing I've ever seen. No, you, you go ahead and finish it. I like my cheese dip finger-free and less strep-throated. (chips crunching) (customers chattering) (baby crying) Honey, you okay? You want something eat? No, I just don't feel like eating. You can have something. You wanna go find me a good, stiff drink? Look, I once heard it said that you can't conquer what you can't confront. Did you get that out of a fortune cookie? - So, no. - Mm. It's still good advice. Are you sure you don't want anything? Not unless you wanna get a big bag of those fortune cookies in case I need some more good advice. Mm-hmm. Did you get enough? (suspenseful music) The darkness takes you, Makes you do things. Corrupts your soul. One moment, I was all happy and the next, (knock on door) Horror, terror. - Chief wants to see you. Once the darkness has you, there's no escaping it. (keyboard clattering) (knock on door) Chief, you wanted to see me? Come on in, Burke. Close the door behind you. Do you mind telling me what's up with the Colin Miller shrine hanging on your wall in your office? Just research. Research? Yes, sir. (Ellis chuckles) Look Burke, I like you. You're one of my best officers. So I'm not gonna sugarcoat this for you. Your boys are worried about you. They think you're taking this Miller obsession a little too far. Chief, I, I just... This has brought a lot of eyes onto Carpenter Falls again. Everything we do is under the microscope, overanalyzed. Now the last thing we need is a media shit-storm on how a police officer believes the boogeyman is still out there biding his time, preparing to attack again. (Ellis sighs) The blow-back from that would be catastrophic. Public panic, media surges. Have you ever seen evil, Chief Ellis? (Ellis chuckles) I know you have a personal connection to this case. Dammit! It was my fault that he escaped! He did it on my watch! And that's, that's a fuck up no one can ever fix. It is time to move on, Burke. Colin Miller is long gone. Now I am asking that you take the contents down off your wall and put them away. Are we clear? (suspenseful music) We're gonna kill something.

I need you to do me a solid and go to the hotel with Mom. Well why do I have to do that? Why can't I stay? Don't tell Jenna, but you're secretly their favorite child. Well, I already kind of knew that. For me? Please? Fine. It's gonna be, it's gonna be fine. I'm so sorry, Daniel. I know I've let you down. I'm so sorry. Mom, it's okay. You get a pass. You go.

(dress unzips) (Blaire moaning) (Blaire laughs) You're gonna kill me. Oh my God. Don't tell me you forgot a rubber. What? No. I just gotta piss real bad. - Seriously?

Yeah, and then in another universe, she's totally not. She's blown two other dudes. She's the girl in my dreams. Time. Speaking of dreams. So last night I had this dream. I go to college and I'm in my dorm and standing there is Carrie Fisher, butt-ass naked. And I know she's dead and all, but it's like this weird social situation. I mean, she is Princess Leia, for fuck sakes. But at the same time, it's like, I'm fucking a zombie. [Both] You boned her. Tonight's the perfect night to make a move on her though, dude. And I mean, if that doesn't work, you can always slip her one of those pixie sticks and get that wet leg going. Tonight's the night. I'm gonna do it. Need some tips, bro? I can show you a thing or two. Fuck off. Hey, man. It's all in the hips. All right, on that note, let's get the rest of this shit packed up before he starts humping my guitar case. What about Pike and Blair? They left like 20, 30 minutes ago. Probably booty banging out in the parking lot right now. Typical, the least reliable asshole I know. Besides this asshole's Nova. - All right, fuck you guys. - All right. I'm out. (soft dramatic music) I feel so bad about Daniel. He understands. I wish, I wish that made me feel better, but it doesn't. You gotta stop beating yourself up over this. We all knew it was a bad decision for you to come back here. I tried to tell you, but you're stubborn. One of your better traits by the way. Well you were right. How does that taste coming outta your mouth? Fucking terrible. (Adam laughs) Look, it's all to be expected. What we went through was unimaginable, but none of it, your fault. (Alex sighs) (soft dramatic music) Chris, Quentin, Trevor, Olivia. Honey, they're all gone. And Olivia, I will never forgive myself for that. You gotta let that shit go. That's the bad shit that's happened to us. You gotta focus on the positive, all the good. Your family adores you, your kids think you're over the moon. You got three amazing kids. Daniel's in a band and stays out of trouble. Jenna goes to school and works, and she still wants to be at home. Kendall's funny. Cute. A little terrifying when she eats. And they all look like they're dad. So I'm calling it a win. (Alex chuckles) You're lucky I love you. And I love you. Now let's get your mind on something a little bit more stimulating. (belt jangling) Like what? Oh, okay. Oh! (laughing) Mm. (Alex laughing) Quit it. We gotta be quiet. Well I'll be quick and quiet. Besides, she's in a queso coma. She's not waking up anytime soon. (Alex laughs) (Adam mimics growling) (crickets chirping) (lighter clicking) - What's wrong? - Nothing. I can't believe we actually just did that, but... But what? It's just a tad awkward with my sister and Valentine in the backseat. I mean, if the car starts rocking, I'm outta here. There's a trail over there. Do you wanna go for a walk? (Daniel chuckles) What is it? You and hiking seem like kind of an oxymoron. I was a girl scout for nine years. You were a girl scout? Sure was. You still got one of those vests? We could totally role play. So Daniel Lawson fantasizes about little girl scouts? No, I'm fantasizing about you and your vest trying to sell me your cookie. Oh, so now you want my cookie, huh? Maybe even your brownie. Stay away from my brownie. We can go for that walk though. Hey, where y'all about to go? - We'll be back. - Yeah, you know black people don't belong in the woods? Everybody getting laid and shit. Guess it's time to loosen up the wrist. (Jenna chuckles) - So I'm serious now. - Mm-hmm. Have you given more thought to, um, getting our own place? You know, leaving the nest and getting a place with your boy Valentine? (Jenna laughs) Of course I have. I just wanna make sure the time is right. It's just the time is right. I mean, all right. Think about this. We could fuck like jack rabbits all day and all night. - Yeah? - And not have to worry about your schizo mother walking in on us. What? (hand slaps) - Be nice. But she is. - Oh my God. (sighs) - I'm sorry. Listen, listen. Hey, hey. (sighs) I just, I want you more in my life, and in my bed more, and in my car more, - Mm? - And in my shower more. - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. (Jenna moaning) - Yeah? - Yeah. Take it off. Mm. - Wait, wait. - What? Is Weezer still out there? You know he's a perv and he's fucking blending. (Alex scoffs) What? Are you serious? Gonna get you wet like a gremlin. (Jenna chuckles) So what's the deal with your mom and this place? She kinda flipped her shit earlier. It's not really something we talk about. (suspenseful music) You're gonna make me tell you, aren't you? I mean, I'm not gonna make you tell me, but I would kind of like to know. Jenna and I were just kids. My parents and some friends decided to head up to a property here for a weekend away in Carpenter Falls. Some crazy dude from here went on the warpath "Helter Skelter" style and carved up their friends. (Holly gasps) My parents were the only survivors. Okay, yeah, I can see why that would be something you don't wanna talk about. It messed mom up pretty bad. Apparently the dude was into some cult-like stuff. Killed his parents as a boy and shit. Claimed some demon made him do it. That's awful. Dad seemed to have gotten over it fine, but mom, not so much. Look. (suspenseful music) Oh, jackpot. What do you mean jackpot? This is creepy as shit. It's abandoned. Don't tell me you're actually afraid. I mean yeah, kind of. - It's an old, empty house. - Exactly, old, empty house. It's probably full of snakes and spiders and rats. Come on. I'll protect you, princess. (Holly sighs) (door opens and closes) Smells like mildew and bacon. It's not that bad. I really hope you don't think you're getting laid in here. Why not? I'm joking. Chill. (Alex scoffs) Oh, come on. (suspenseful music) I knew I shouldn't have listened to my ma. "Don't get the guitar, Weezer. Play the drums, Weezer. Girls dig the drummer, Weezer." Fucking piece of shit. Maybe if I got that guitar, I wouldn't be in these hillbilly-ass backwoods. I wouldn't be about to jerk off and I'll probably have any bitch I want. (suspenseful music) You gotta be fucking kidding me. A graveyard? Kasie Miller. (lighter clicking) (Weezer inhaling) I blaze here today in your honor. I hope you were at least a bad bitch when you were alive, because before this night's over, I'm gonna cover your grave with my baby gravy. (laughs) It's all a fucking pathetic I'm really about to beat off to a dead bitch. It's a damn shame. (lighter clicking) (suspenseful music) (Jenna laughing) (window shatters) (Jenna screams) Naughty girl (gasping) No! (screams) - (laughs) Naughty girl. - No! Let me go! - When he was reviled, he did not revile in return. When he suffered, he did not threaten, but entrusted. He who would judge him just. Fuck you, shoelace bandit. (knife slices) (bodies thudding) (fist thwacking) Shut the fuck up! What the fuck do you people want? I said, what the fuck do you people want? Bill, watch out! (ax whacks) (flesh squelching) (blood spurting) Bill, no! (blood spraying) (Myles laughing) (Valentine groaning) Bill! Don't worry. We'll take good care of her. (suspenseful music) I always love checking out abandoned houses. If these walls could talk, I bet they have plenty of stories to tell. Yeah, somehow I don't think this would be a good one. Oh, shit, Kasie. Fuck. I'm tired about this fucking band getting no pussy. Making me bust up on a fucking grave. Oh shit. Fuck! Oh yeah. Here it comes, Kasie. (suspenseful music) (knife slicing) Okay. That's enough creepy for one night. Can we just go back to the car? Listen. Someone's coming. Okay. Turn the light off. Jenna. (suspenseful music) Daniel, what are you gonna do? - They have my sister. - Yeah, no shit, Sherlock, but you can't just run out there. They'll kill you. - Holly, that's my fucking sister. Daniel, you can't, that's suicide. (wood banging) Shit, fuck. (door bangs) (Maddy laughing) Here I come! Whee! (cabinet bangs) Shh. Boo! (Maddy laughing) (suspenseful music) Daniel, don't open the door. (door scraping) Daniel, we can go call somebody then can come back. Please, let's go. I can't leave her. (door scrapes and slams) (distorted whispering) (suspenseful music) There isn't much time, Alex. What are you talking about? Jenna? Alex. To save them, you'll have to face your darkest fears. (distorted whispering) (crows cawing) (Alex gasping) Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message. Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message. Fuck. (suspenseful music) What the hell is that? (horn blaring) (doors closing) (glass cracking) Look. Get a load of this. Maybe they hit a deer. You don't suspect foul play, do you? Maybe. (intense music) - It's him. - It's who? The guy I was telling you about earlier. We have to find Jenna. (suspenseful music) (soft dramatic music) Alex, what are you doing? Kids aren't back yet. Think something's wrong. Maybe not. They're just out doing what teenagers do. It's 2:00 AM, Adam. They should have been back long before now. I can't get either one of 'em on their cell phones plus this dream or warning or I don't know, call it whatever you wanna call it, but she's trying to tell me something. Who's trying to tell you what? Look, I know that this sounds crazy, okay? But ever since we got back here, I've been seeing her and I know it's not just a coincidence. Hey, you're gonna have to help me out here. I'm not following. Olivia. Olivia. As in dead, Olivia? Look, I know how it sounds. No, I don't think you do She showed me the kids at the old Miller house. - Alex. - I know, okay? I know that this is insane. Believe me, I do. But something is wrong. I can feel it. Is this is what we talked about earlier? No, dammit, this, this has nothing to do with that. Then this is nuts then. That's what it is. (Alex scoffs) You're talking to a ghost and shit, it's gotta stop. I have to protect them. From who? He's dead. I have to be sure, Adam. Fine. You wanna be chained to Colin Miller for the rest of your life, go ahead. I refuse. - And what is that supposed to mean? - It means look at what this is doing to your children. They shouldn't have to see the mom going through this. If you can't get past it for yourself, get past it for them at least. But what if I can't? I don't know how! (soft dramatic music) (hand patting) Come here. Come on. (Adam sighs) You act like like if I wasn't even there with you, like I didn't go through the same shit you did. When I look in the mirror every day, I see the scars. I know what that monster did to our family, but I made a choice to move on because my kids need me, and goddammit, I need my kids. I know. I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. This is total bullshit. (cries) I just want this to be over. I want you to be okay. Okay. I'll try harder, I promise. Look, I think I'm just gonna go for a walk. I just wanna go clear my head. Get some air, maybe a cup of coffee. You, you want one? I wouldn't say no to a cup of coffee or whiskey at this point. Okay. Okay. You want me to come with you? No, no. I just wanna be alone. Plus, I don't want you to wake up Kendall. I'll be fine. Okay. I love you. I love you too. (intense music) (Jenna gasping) (chuckles) We love because he first loved us. I promise you'll love her. And I would say you're a nasty Carrie. (laughs) Do you ever hear the voices? Hmm? You hear the voices? You do. (laughs) You do, you do, you do. - No. - You do! Because, because we all hear the voices. (Jenna sobbing) Even, even you. Oh, you turn your back on the voices. Why? I don't know why. You need bloody listen! - No, no! - Huh? Oh, and they want me to do No, please. Horrible, horrible things. Do you, uh... Oh, you're so warm. Don't fight. - No. Don't fight, don't fight. Please, please. No, don't fight. No, no, no. - It'll hurt less. - No! No, no! (Myles laughing) (clothes tearing) (Jenna sobbing) Please, please don't. (Myles grunts) (Jenna screams) (suspenseful music) - It's Jenna. No! (Jenna screaming) (Jenna gasping) (Myles grunting) Fuck! (Myles laughing) (grunts) Fuck! Fuck! (sobbing) (hammer whacks) - Ow. - Daniel here. (body thuds) (Jenna gasping) - It's okay. - You okay? We're gonna get you out of here. Come on. It's okay. (Jenna sobbing) (rope creaking) (Myles groaning) (intense music) (Myles laughing) You're okay. Yay, new lovers! (intense music) (fist whacks) (hammer clinks) (body slams) (Daniel choking) (head bangs) (phone ringing) (indistinct chattering) Officer, I need your help. My kids are missing. Ma'am, what's going on? They, they disappeared and I think they're in trouble. Oh, okay. How long they've been missing? I, I don't know. A few hours. Okay. 48 hours is typical for missing persons report. (hand slams) - Fuck that! I need your help now! And I need you to calm down. (sighs) Fine. Listen, I know that this is gonna sound crazy, but I think they're at the old Miller house. The Miller house? (sighs) You fucking listen to me! I need your help now! And I need you to take your hands off of me. Alex, Alex Curtis? Lawson. Yeah, whatever. What the hell is going on out here? No idea, she came barging through the door, said her kids were at the Miller house, I- Look, my kids are missing, and I think they're at the old Miller house in trouble. Have you taken her statement? - No, I haven't. - Yeah, hard to believe, right? Look, before we do anything, we're gonna have to sort through- We don't have time to sort through shit, okay? We need to go, please! Look, you can do this with my help or you can do it on your own. It's up to you. (Alex sighs) (crickets chirping) (suspenseful music) Daniel. Daniel! Can you hear me? Where are we? I don't know. (door bangs) (drawer opens) (Jenna whimpers) I'm gonna hurt you, Colin Miller? (door bangs) Hi kids. Yes. Don't you fucking touch her. Oh, you are so dramatic. Ooh, look at 'em, look at 'em go. (Holly sobbing) What are you gonna do to me? I'm just gonna get you all clean. (Holly sobbing) (Maddy laughing) Oh no. Don't cry. If you cry then I'm gonna cry. (both sobbing) (laughing) Oh, this is so much fun. (blood splashing) All clean. (laughing) All clean for daddy. (sighs) I should be home in bed. Not dealing with this. Chief, you didn't have to come down here. I could have handled this. Excuse me. When can I see my wife? Thank you for coming down, Mr. Lawson. Just give us a few with your wife and we'll get back to you. Thank you. What are we gonna do with her? You tell me, kiddo. (Kendall sighs) Alex, long time. No, see. Chief. I'd say it we're good to see you if it were under any other circumstances. (Alex sighs) All right. Why don't we start with you telling me why you are back here in Carpenter Falls? It doesn't matter why I'm back. My kids are missing. Okay. When did they go missing? After the music thing downtown. I think they're at the old Miller house. We actually found a car tonight abandoned about a mile from the Miller property. It was a white Toyota. Had the back window broken out. Oh my God, that's them. They were with friends. (sighs) Okay, Alex, I shouldn't be telling you this given your connection to this case. Telling me what? The Mathis siblings escaped during a transfer this evening, people were killed. Now we don't know this for sure, but there's a chance they could be heading back to Carpenter Falls. Oh my, oh my God. Now we have every available officer in town looking for them, and we don't know for sure. I have to find my kids! Okay. And we're gonna help you. Then quit fucking around and get me to the old Miller house. I'll take her. I mean, I'll accompany her. Not alone, you won't. Tromer, you go with Burke. See if you guys can locate the kids. (suspenseful music) You get lost on your way to the coffee shop? What the hell's going on? It's the kids. They found Valentine's car out by the old Miller property. What? Adam, the Mathis kids escaped. There's been murders. We have to find Daniel and Jenna. We're gonna go out there now. Me and those officers. Okay, well I'm coming with. Can I come? Baby bug. Oh, here. Let me save you some time. "Kendall, you can't go with us." Correct. Where we're going is dangerous. What's going on anyways? Where's Daniel and Jenna? Sweetie, we're going to get them right now. Okay? Are they gonna be grounded? For life. I wanna come with you guys. I know. I'm sorry. But we won't be gone very long. Stay here, watch TV, eat donuts, drink coffee. We'll be back soon. Love you, girl. I love you, baby bug. We'll see you in little bit. Okay? Go with this nice lady. Yeah. Yeah. I better get rewarded for this, like major rewarded. Anything you want. It's gonna be expensive. I'd expect nothing less. (suspenseful music) All clean. Holly. (Holly sobbing) Please don't hurt her. Please. (laughs) Please, please. And I thought you knew how this would end for each of you. But who goes first? Holly, Holly, Holly, Holly. You can do whatever you want to me, just let her go. Please? - Daniel, no! Shut up, Jenna! Please. (knife clinks) - No, stop! Colin, stop. Please, just stop. Colin, please stop! Just stop, Colin, please, just stop! (gasping) He can't save you. You're all alone. And it's telling me to spill your putrid fucking guts! (knife stabbing) (Mrs. Miller screams) (grunting) Fuck yes! (knife stabbing) (flesh squelching) (entrails plopping) (suspenseful music) (Colin breathes heavily) Hmm. (knife slicing) (Holly gasping) - Holly! No! (blood dripping) (Holly gasping) Holly! (Jenna sobbing) Holly. Holly. (intense music) (distorted whispering) I did it. Killed her. I killed them all. (Colin laughing) Oh fuck, I'm a killer. I'll be fucking damned. So this is what it feels like. I said I fucking killed them! They're all dead! (intense music) (Colin spitting) (Colin laughing maniacally) Daniel? Jenna? Oh God. - Kids! Daniel! Jenna! How far is the Miller house from here? It's less than a mile. Oh, oh, Holly! Oh, Holly, Holly! Holly, Holly, Holly! - Don't you fucking touch her! - Don't you touch her! - I'll fucking kill you! He might kill me. Oh, do it. Come on, come on, come on, come on. - I'm gonna fucking do it! - No, Holly, oh, poor Holly. Oh, where you going? No. Get off! You wanna know what Holly tastes like? (laughs) No, no! (laughs) Taste her, taste her, see what she tastes like. Jenna! Jenna! Oh, oh, oh, oh. - Jenna, run! - Oh yes. - Go! - No, no, no, Jenna, really. Jenna, bad, bad girl. - Jenna, just go. - You better run. Jenna, run. (laughs) (Maddy laughs) Oh Holly, do you miss Holly? Look, here's Holly right here. Did you ever taste Holly? Oh. (laughs) She really, she tastes good, doesn't she? (laughs) (both laughing) Mm. - Oh. - Jenna, run! - Jenna, run! One, two...(laughs) You're so cute. (laughs) (crickets chirping) (suspenseful music) Let's go. The basement, Alex. (echoes) (suspenseful music) (door opens) There ain't nothing here. They're here, Adam. This is exactly what she showed me in the vision. Check the door. (door scraping) Burke, the basement! Mm. (breathes heavily) Alex. Just be careful firing that thing down there. Could cause an explosion. Okay. (suspenseful music) Oh, are you worried about your big sister? You can't imagine the things that I did to her. And my sister, oh, she's gonna do so much more. (laughs) I thought your freaks were supposed to be mutes. You talk too much. You hurt my little feelings, (laughs) but it's okay, because everything that I did to your sister, I'm gonna do so much worse. (Daniel whimpering) (Myles laughing) Fucking try it, Buffalo Bill. (spits) (Myles laughing) Oh, tastes like Holly. (Daniel whimpering) (Myles laughing) Holly, mm, Holly. (both screaming) Yeah, there he is! (laughing) (Jenna panting) (knife slices) (Jenna groaning) (intense music) (knife slices) (Jenna screams) (Jenna gasping) (knife slicing) (Jenna screaming) No! (knife slices) (Jenna screams) (intense music) Drop the knife! Drop the knife! (gun fires) (blood spurts) (blood dripping) (body thuds) Jenna. Jenna. It's okay. They killed everybody. (sobbing) Jenna, Jenna, baby, where's you brother? They have him. Have to get her up. (Jenna groaning) Adam, she's really hurt. Can, can you walk? My legs. (radio static) This is Burke. This is, I need, this is Burke. I need to back up. Goddamn, I can't get a signal. (radio static) - Me either. Look, I know you wanna find your son, but we need to get her out of here. She needs medical attention. - No, I am not leaving here without my son. Alex, he's right. She needs to go to the hospital. Tromer, you go with Mr. Lawson and his daughter. When you get to service, call for backup. Alex and I will find your son. No, Alex, you take her. No, I can't. I can't carry her. She's too heavy. You have to do it. I'm not leaving you down here. I am not leaving here without both of our children! All right. Come on. Goddammit, Alex. Go. (Jenna groaning) (upbeat pop music) Uh, I am the boogeyman. (foot thuds) (head bangs) (Daniel groaning) (suspenseful music) How many are left? Check that. (barrel clicks) - Shit. There's no bullets. (Burke sighs) What is that? Shit. Yeah. (suspenseful music) (Jenna groaning) It's okay, baby, it's okay. You guys wait here. I'm gonna make sure everything's okay. It's all right, sweetie. He's gonna check it out. The coast is clear. (intense music) (Jenna gasping) (knife stabbing) - Fuck. - Fuck. Come on, come on! (Jenna groaning) Keep going. - Dad, I can't! (upbeat pop music) (glass shattering) You stay the fuck away from my son! Danny. - Mom. Burke, help me get him up. Baby, baby, are you okay? - Yes. - Yeah? We're gonna get you outta here. Okay? - Yeah. - Okay, okay we're gonna go. Okay. Let's go, let's go. Daniel, Daniel, come on. Let's go. It's my fault. What? It's all my fault. No, no, baby. This is not your fault. They're all dead because of me. Honey, you didn't do this? This is not your fault. - Yes, I did! If I hadn't have booked that stupid fucking gig, none of this shit would've happened! It's not, no. Baby, no. You know how sometimes people will look at you and they'll say they know how you feel when they really don't? Dammit, Daniel, look at me! I know how you feel. I do. Okay? Okay. But right now you have got to listen to me. Your dad and Jenna are waiting. We've gotta get the hell out of this place. Okay? - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Okay? Okay, come on.

(ax thwacks) (flesh squelches) (blood spurting) (intense music) (crickets chirping) (soft dramatic music) What is this place? Home. This is where you grew up? Yeah. We don't have much time. Come on, babe. I got ya, I got ya. - Thanks, daddy. (suspenseful music) Alex. (footsteps pattering) (crickets chirping) (Jenna groaning) What are we gonna do? We're gonna set a trap. A trap? Find something you can use as a weapon. (suspenseful music) - No. - What's wrong? Just a lot of bad memories here. Well, they weren't all bad, right? No, no, baby, they weren't all bad.
