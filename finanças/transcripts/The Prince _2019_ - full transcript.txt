By afternoon chairs are on the sidewalk to watch how birds fly. San Bernardo is not poor or sad but kids don't runaway. Santiago is close by, but seems far by pure shyness. I looked like a desperate wild boy. I ended up sweating like a horse. With clothes stuck to my body. Where's my dad? He's not here. He hasn't come yet. We were stealing peaches. And suddenly Elena appears. She was crying. - Why? - I don't know. - What did you do to her? - Nothing. Do you think that we... Can we see each other again? Here? = se we can be spotted here. Where?

You wanna look like sandro? You wanna be famous? Great! I'll take your photo, you bastard. Do you have any talent? - I'm pretty. - That fucking useless. - It always works. - Inside, but not outside.

When the debt of third world countries reaches... The incredible figure of... - 95 billion... - Robert! What's up? When my country... We're listening to chicho. Why listen to him, man? Prisoners don't vote. The kid wants to be an artist and doesn't have a guitar. There's one behind the curtain. Let's see. - But it's old. - A problem with oldies? They are good for the first time. Remember the oldie you fucked? == == reat le ee rw that's a bad start! Where did Plato go? Can't play with five fingers. Take it easy. I hope you learn to play it soon. Why? If you learn to play an instrument, you'll never be alone again. Anxiety to having you in my arms... What's that song? A friend taught it to me. It's true, you idiot. Maybe my thoughts... Are crying out... My tears are like pearls... Falling into the sea. And the drowsy echo... Of this lament... What a beautiful song. And in my dreams... The anxiety... Would you fuck a fag for money? I don't know. If it's a lot of money, maybe. But that shit's risky because old men have money. And a young one? Don't know. And kiss your lips again... Where do you live? - Around here. - Alone? No, with my dad. Let's take a ride first, then I'll take you home. Hop on. See lads, you're under arrest. The big one for drunk driving, the little one for being a drunk. What are you laughing at? Are you going to sleep together, you fags? Right, get in! - Get in, I said! - Come on, let's go! Get in. Okay, okay. [ Wanna puke. Jaime. Jaime, I'm gonna puke. What is it? Someone must be coming. Julio, Miguel! Go and see who's come. Let's go. It must be someone important. They're welcoming him like an artist. Don't you say hello anymore? I'll be back later; When you're more presentable, more dressed up. For you, kiddo. Who's the Argentinian? How could that jerk be Argentinian? He's Chilean, man. Do you know him? Well, you were telling me... - How are you, negrito? - What do you want? For now, three times four; Twelve beers. - We're done with that. - Okay, beer.

Bad mood and feeling tough, motherfucker? What are you hiding, asshole? Munoz. Nothing, sergeant. This fag's hiding something. We'll have to check. On all fours. He's talking to you, faggot! Do it or we'll beat the shit out of you! Let's see, let's see, let's see... You got a nice butt, asshole. Do you wanna eat something long and hard, faggot? Who's got some vaseline? - Tough guys love it like that. - Vaseline is for pussies, right? A bit of vaseline. Why be so cruel? This is the size we've got. It's better to fuck them than beatimg them up. That'll fucking do it. I got bored, assholes! This inmate's never has broken down. He's a hard nut to crack. Leave me alone, motherfucker! You know, it could be with a stick or without it. I brought the one with stick. That's five escudos. - And the cigarettes? - One escudo. - Lost something? - Any of these is one escudo. They're Argentinian cigarettes. Good ones, by the way. These are tango handkerchiefs. For ballsy guys. - How much for the black jacket? - You can't afford it. Take a nougat, and you owe me two escudos. I said two escudos. - How much? - It already has an owner. - Can it be negotiated? - It can be. Get out of here. Sess - for you. - I don't have any money. Take me to lunch, that'll do. To celebrate, have one. They're Argentinian. - Stud... - I'm eating. What a beautiful cat. Whose is it? What's it's name? It's mine and his name is Plato. Plato. Like the philosopher. No, dumb-ass, 'cause he's platinum. It's a very cute name. And a very cute cat. What happened to the guitar? Police. And you didn't get another one? Next month. - Don't you want one now? - What do you want, fucker? The cell. It's bigger than mine. I need more space. I'm doing well with the business. I hope you get fucked up the ass. With a broomstick? Get out of here, motherfucker! Get out of here, motherfucker! - You' so rude. - Get out, you jerk. See you, Plato. Oh, gypsy! Like you. You should cut your hair like sandro. Okay, buddy. For you. Have you ever ridden a motorcycle before? Ia Feels good. The wind on your face. The smell of fuel, grass and smoke. Feels good. - You were scared. - Nah... It's what your body said. You're crazy. - Why did you hold me so tightly? - I didn't wanna fall of. - So you were scared. - No. I would've died happy. Why were you tickling my tummy? [ Just was happy. Sees ee ee ee ee =e ea oa fe tm - nothing. - Just say it. You're a grown up, tell me. I like... your smile. I really like it. - Can I tell you a secret? - Okay. - I stole this smile. - How? For real. When I was about 9, [ went to a fair, near the 18th bus stop. And a guy turned up in this awesome outfit. A guitarist. They got him a stool, he settled, and then he smiled. His smile was so pretty... He sang as few more tangos, and when they clapped, he smiled again and I took note of it. I remember it from back then. It's in my head. I dream of one like that. The jacket? And the life. You can't find that shit in Chile. Stud, can we have a word back there? Let's go. We're done. And the movie? Like you're watching, dickhead. Let's go. And the drowsy echo... Of this lament... Makes you present... And in my dreams... Maybe you will cry... When you remember me... And frantically clasp... My portrait to your chest... And to your ears will drift... This savage melody... And the echo of the sorrow... Of being without you. The anxiety... Of having you in my arms... Musing... Loving words... The anxiety... Of having your charm... And kissing your lips again... [ Started to study myself, the sun was weak and penetrated the cell... I look good. How the others see me? I wasn't ugly. Someone would find me pretty? What would call more attention... My eyes, the mouth, the hair of just my body... Or everything just regular. And you? Why are you so happy? Adult stuff. Do you think I'm too young? I'm happy too, by the way. Really? I don't think it's for the same reason. [T must be for the opposite reason. [ Don't know. It'll be a secret. Tell me. Walls can listen us. Whisper in my ear. How many times do you shower, rucio? Two or three times. Why so often? - Because everything's dirty in here. - The roof is dirty. And that? The prince has a big dick. Your self-esteem is high. He thinks he's the prince. We should see it, right? Show us. You're looking good. We should see it, because... Rucio's is like... Two fists. I should measure them, right? It's big. You'd like the new jacket, right? Join us. We go out there and you get the jacket. You coming? You got excited. You enjoy this shit, right? Go make the bed. What were you doing with those fags in the shower? - Thanks, Ricardo. - You motherfucker! Play some shit. You play like shit. I'll ask Roberto to give you a class today. I don't wanna see you with those jerks anymore, got it? [ Gotit. Why are you in such a bad mood? - Since when? - A few days. Because my sentence isn't sorted out yet. Do you wanna leave? Who wants to be here, dumb-ass? That's because all this 1s new to you, man. Just wait seven years and no one comes to visit you. Nobody comes to see me. That's because you haven't had a family. No kids, no wife. And yours? She must be somewhere, living her life. And the who came to see you? A That's not Cristina. Cristina was beautiful. The only women who wait for you after prison are fat, ugly, with no teeth and lugging around five kids. Cristina was beautiful. She worked in El carrusel, - in the cat game. - What's the cat game? Cat game, a game... With those cats, with round eyes and you play with a sock ball. [ Spent hours playing there and [ Wasted all my money on that fucking game just to be close to her. She never forgave me for my shitty life. Ta Cristina was a decent person. Have you seen Plato? =a ew it hasn't turned up in days. Should be around. It's a cat. - How? - From this one. Here? That's it. - Sounds good. - That's it. And then? Good afternoon! Can we? I've got your Plato. It stayed in my cell. You could've told me, asshole. We were awaiting for a tango, che pibe! You want a tango? A tango it'll be. You're a singer too? - You have to learn everything, stud. - Is there any shit you don't know? I didn't learn to hold grudges. You won't know... What happened to Plato? It's been elusive for days. It's the Argentinean faggot's fault. Wasn't he Chilean? If I'm gonna hate him, I prefer him as an Argentinean. To understand... What is love and going insane. Your burning kisses, your intoxicating lips that torture my reason. I know... That I will never... Could leave this love away. Nevertheless, [ Torment myself... Because I carry you in my veins and every moment, feverish and lover; [ wanna kiss your lips. [ Love you always, you're attached to me like a dagger in the flesh. Ardent and passionate, trembling with anxiety... I want to die... On your lips. That's it. Thanks a lot, guys! Now sing a Chilean one, dumb-ass. - Are you Chilean or not? - They asked for a tango, stud. Are you Chilean or not, motherfucker? Or are you gonna deny your country? Enough! Show's over, assholes! Everyone to their cells, get out! To your cells, to your cells! Get out! Hurry, move it! Bye, knife. Why do you stick up for him? Do you like him? Go to bed. - And with me, asshole! - Motherfucker!

We're buying. It was a good day, we sold 800 escudos. We're loaded. Let me introduce myself. Some folks call me tropical. Not because I'm horny, I'm just good-looking. Because I'm manly and a great dancer. - Jaime. - A pleasure. Things are hotting up. Thanks. - One for our friend. - He already has one. Son of a bitch! What did you do to me? Motherfucker! - Son of a bitch! - What's up, eh? No, no! No knives! No! No knives! Get in, you bastards! Get in! Please stop them! No, we're not going inside. They could kill us.

Oie =e ee why you care so much? I'm tossing it in the trash. Do whatever you have to do. Let me do what I have to do. Smoke. - I don't want one. - It'll make you feel better. Do you wanna eat? I'm not hungry. Me neither. You're gonna sleep in my bed. And you? I'll sleep on the floor. Sleep with me then. = = = sa see Ricardo's waiting for you in the hospital. Move it. Este hi, prince. - Why are you smiling? - Nothing. Bullshit. Tell me, you're about to die? No, idiot. I'll be back soon. The jacket! - Is it for me? - No asshole, for me. Put it on. Now...

What do you do? In life? I just live. That's the way! - You look good, gypsy. - Why, tropical? Just because I like legs, I... I'd take you to dance. So what's the hang-up? Come with your king. Honey... If you want my life, say it quietly. I'll give it to you. Give me just a little, nothing more than a little, of that love that you hide, and you'll be my well-being... Good morning!

Your alias? - I don't have one. - You must. You'll sleep there. And be respectful, 'cause we're in mourning here. Can you show respect? Ee es esa tease sass what's that? It's my radio. You'll have to go back to your cell sometime. I know that. Tomorrow. Can I stay with you today? Te Take him to the showers. You're dirty. Let's go. I ask you all... To go to your houses... With the healthy joy of gaining a clean victory. And tonight, when you pet your children, when you look for rest, think about... The tough future we have before us. We must put... More passion and more love into making our Chile greater and greater and making life in our homeland ever more just.
