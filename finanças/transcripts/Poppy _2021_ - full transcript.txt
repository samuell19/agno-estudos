Are you sure? - Don't you start with me. I know what I'm talking about. - Will it be ready for the Burnout? - That depends on whether or not he pays, and at this stage, it's highly unlikely. - What does a yellow reflector, cat's eye, placed on the road mean? I've got a cat. He's called Bruce, after Bruce McLaren. - Concentrate, Poppy. I'm not allowed to help you. Hmm... Yellow reflector? No passing.

Is there anyone else? - Yes! - Seriously, I didn't think when you said you'd fix my car in return for driving lessons, we'd be using a customer's car. - We can try yours, but I don't think it's ready. Don't worry, Luke. I've done it before. Just went down the road. - A bit cheeky, aren't you? - (GIGGLES) (ENGINE STARTS) - Ready? - Yes. - Lights. All right. Look both ways. Tum let.

It's your choice. - (SIGHS) - You're welcome to wait in the reception area, Dave. - Thanks, but I'm not gonna wait around while you give my sister unwanted... advice, so... - You OK? There you go, Poppy. You're all set. Now, just wait seven days to be safe, OK? And good on you, Poppy, for looking after yourself. - Thank you. COMMENTATOR: Yuki Tsunoda. He's coming and coming fast.

Do you think I don't know that you've been sneaking around behind my back? - I'm fixing Luke's car. But it didn't cost you anything, because... you don't pay me! - What are you talking about, Poppy? I'm talking about you taking customers' cars for joyrides. But if that's the case, then his car stays here. Give me the keys. Poppy, give me your keys! Give me your keys! - (GRUNTS) I'll be back later. (CAR ALARM CHIRPS) (ENGINE STARTS, CAR DRIVES OFF) - Luke, have you been practising? - Yep. - Show me.
