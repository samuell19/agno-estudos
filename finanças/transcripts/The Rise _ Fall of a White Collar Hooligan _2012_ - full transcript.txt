[Francuski naglasak] Čini se da si se lijepo snašao ovdje 3 00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,888 Kako dugo planiraš ostati? Ovdje si već mjesec dana. Nitko nije došao zbog tebe. NIsi imao posjetitelja. Nitko cak ni nije pitao za tebe. Nitko ti nije napisao pismo. Zar nemaš obitelj? Nemaš lijepu malu djevojčicu koju bi htio vidjeti? Mislim, mogu ti to ostvariti. Mogu te staviti na vlak kući još danas. Samo mi reci što znaš. Tvoj problem. Ugodan dan. [narrator] They think Hn just a thiet lprefer the term white collar hooligan. [man] Allume la lumiére dans la cellule 18. [narrator] This is my story. [rap music] [man] This is the police. All crowds should disperse this area immediately. [narrator] The beautiful game. Our great nation% number one sport. Every week, hundreds of thousands of people cram their way into these places to follow their team. I love it, and if you love it too, you don't need me to explain. If you don't know what I mean, no explanation will ever make you understand. Being a part of the crowd, the mob, gives you a great sense of power, like animals in a pack. We?e strong because of the group. We 'H always be OK 'cause our mates have got our back. I fucking love this game, the skill, the dedication and the Hnesse on the pitch, the awesome power of the crowd in the stands. Fucking fruit! Yeah, you! Yeah, you, you fucking pig cunt! - Oi, Mike. - Come on, you fucking mug! - Dickhead! - Fucking hell. Oi, Mike! Ed. Eddie Hill, mate. What you doing here? - Same thing as you. - Hey, fuck you, you cunt, you dickhead! They're bringing the fucking tear gas out. You wanna go for a drink? - The Duke's open. - Let's go, mate. Come on, let's fuck off. Watch out, lads. Go on. [Mike] A great man once said football wasn't a matter of life and death. It was more important than that. He was right. - What fucking happened to him? - Fuck knows. He's probably an accountant by the sound of it. - Oh, shit, mate. - What? - Oh. Fuck me. I'm gonna have to go. - Fuck off. - I thought we were going for a drink. - Yeah. it's work, mate. Not really something I can say no to. I'll tell you what, let's have a big one tonight, a proper catch-up. - D'you know Terry's on Gloucester Road? - I know it. Perfect. Freshen up and we'll meet in a couple of hours. We'll catch up then. - A couple of hours? - Two hours. Two hours. All right, sweet. Oi! Look at me when I'm trying to talk to you. - What you been doing with yourself? - Bit of this, bit of that. - Oh, shit. Unemployed. - No, just not many jobs out there. - Know what I mean, Ed? - Bollocks. There's fucking hundreds of jobs around. Loads of them. Just nobody wants to do them. Well, except retards. Nobody wants to fucking flip burgers or wipe arses for minimum wage, do they? - And who can blame them? - I've been doing a lot of interviews. Yeah, no, course, mate. I'm not slagging you off. I respect you. I think you've got the right idea. Know your worth. Wait for the right opportunity to come up. You know the England manager position's open? You should go for that. Yeah, very funny. [laughs] Give it up, mate. Nicey Pricey is bad news. She would chew you up and spit you out. Actually, mate, I do have a bit of work on I could throw your way. Give me a call on this number if you want a bit of cash for some driving. I really appreciate that, Ed. I'm just not looking to get into anything dodgy right now. - You know what I mean, mate? - Nothing dodgy. it's all above board. Easy money for a bit of driving I'm trying to throw my mate's way. Yeah, I bet. With dodgy little packages in the back seat of the motor. Mike, that is really harsh. Ed, you grew up five minutes away from me, son. Look at you now. With a whistle, birds wrapped round you in a place like this. You're either a drug dealer or you're in the music industry. You wanna be a singer? [whispers] Mate, I gotta shoot off for a minute. Let me take care of something. I'll be back in a bit. - Handwriting's good. - What? Handwriting. Um... If you bothered to take a look, which, I'm not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sure you haven't, you'd notice that I've taken great care to make everything nice and... nice and legible. Full of all the jobs I've been applying for here. - Mm-hm. - And... And not been getting. It's a competitive market. Have you considered going back to university? - I left university a little while ago. - Got kicked out? Well, no. I didn't complete my degree. Look, I just need something that's a bit better than minimum wage that takes half a brain to do, you know what I mean? Yes, but we've been sending you on interviews. But there's not many jobs around at the moment and a lot of people out of work. But do try again in a week or so. I really am trying, babe. I sent my CV to those agencies you gave me. But, to be honest, I ain't gonna hold my breath. Well, don't lose hope, OK? You'll find something that not only pays well, that's enjoyable and that challenges you. You'll find it soon. Thank you. Thank you for making my lunch break more bearable. Well, thank you for buying me lunch... ...and maybe renewing my season ticket? Baby, do you think we should be a little bit more careful with money? Just until we're both earning. I know, football is part of you, I love you, ergo I must understand and love your love of football even if I don't share it. Now, I'm not gonna start moaning about buying you a season ticket. Just don't let me down, OK? I won't, I promise. Safe. Oh, what, the short slee...? Don't worry, they'll grow back, mate. What attracted me most to working in a ladies clothes shop? Ladies. Huh. You all right there? Wanna... Job like this must take a lot of restraint. Yeah, seriously, you wanna be quiet a little bit? This is lovely. This is a bit of me, this, look. Oh, it's a bit tight, though, innit? Fucking hell, have I put on weight? Do I look fat to you, bruv? Have you got any experience recording live music? Not much live music per se, but I do remember recording the radio, and it takes a lot of skill to press stop before the DJ starts talking. Listen, listen, don't, don't... I'll do anything, all right? I'm... I'm a bit fucking desperate, to be honest. I like gold, really, 'cause you should always invest in gold 'cause it's... available. But I've got a bird and she obviously wears clothes. You know. Pretty much makes me a fucking expert really, doesn't it? You ever used an MX380 before? No worries. I should be sweet with that. I prefer the BlackBerry, though. Now, seriously now, yeah? I'll do cash in hand, all right? Just under the table, no questions. Yeah? - Can I have a job? - No. All right, can I have a doner and chips? Hold the salad. Leave us alone, would you? What the fuckk all this? Well, maybe it's time to just lower your sights a little bit. You've been out of work for a while, which doesn't look good on your CV. And not to mention they've stopped paying your Jobseeker's Allowance. Mm. There is one more place I could try. [whistling] Hey. - Sorry I'm late. - About fucking time. - Have you seen this? - What's that? There's a recession going on and we're spending 18 million quid on a centre back. He's too fucking short. Here, listen, good things come in small packages. Don't worry about it. - Is that what the missus told you? - Shut up. Speaking of small packages, that, my friend, is yours. It's a fucking hairdryer. I'm gonna get fucking laughed at. No, you're not, mate. Come on, look at it. It's the embodiment of inconspicuous. it's great on fuel economy. It's fully insured and it is all 100% yours, for work. Come on, mate. Look at it. I can totally see you in this car. - Mikey, the successful hooligan. - Fuck off. All right, well, how about this? New phone. Brand-new work phone. New phone, new car, fully insured. List all the good things I'm doing for you. Work phone, work car. Yeah, great. Not gonna do me much good getting the shit kicked out of me. You're not gonna get the shit kicked out of you. it's not rocket science. It's easy money for a bit of driving. All you've gotta do is take packages I give you to an address I tell you to go to. - Bang, you're done. - And they give me the money? Y... No. Nobody said anything about any money. Look, you just take the package to the address I give you. Give me a call. I'll phone the guys. They'll come down. They might give you a package back. Look, it's got nothing to do with drugs. - Yeah, but it is drugs, though, innit? - No, it is not drugs. The sentence for drugs is ridiculous, which reminds me, mate, I don't want you drinking or driving in this car, insured or not. Keep the tyres fully inflated. Make sure the lights work. I don't need you pulled over. Because you don't want the Old Bill finding the drugs. There are no drugs in this fucking car. I'm telling you. Come on. I've actually got a date tonight, I've got somewhere to be, you know that? Right, this is gonna be your first assignment. You take this to that address. - What, now? - Yes, now. Do you have a pressing dinner engagement I don't know about? No, but I just thought... That you wouldn't have to do the job in order to do the job? Come on, mate. I don't know. Look, Mikey, if you don't wanna do this, you don't have to do it. If the dole money is keeping you happy and you're just trundling along fine with Katie, then don't do this. It's easy money for a bit of driving. I'm just trying to help a mate out. Oh, mate, look, it's not fucking drugs, is it? It's not drugs. First week's wages. - I need the fucking money. - Good boy. - And the keys are in the ignition. - Yeah, yeah. Oh, Mikey, that feeling in the pit of your stomach? That goes away. Fucking hell. Great. Fucking delivery service for PC World. [voicemail bleeps] [Ed] Hello, mate. lbet you looked inside that box already. I told you it wasn't drugs. Listen, the boys are gonna be there in 15 minutes. Just sit tight. [bleeps] [Mike] I was shitting it. In my head, every car behind me was undercover police and every speed limit a chance to get pulled over. Eddie said it was all legit. But if it was, why the hell weren't we using DHL? It did cross my mind to call him and tell him I'd changed my mind. But the prospect of more job inten/iews and queuing up at the dole ofHce resolved me to stick it out. After all, moneyk money. I soon got into the swing of things. [rap music] [inaudiblel Speaking of which, you've been doing good at the job. - it's a piece of piss. - I know, but you never ask questions. Well, you pay me to drive, deliver shit. it's what I do. It's nothing. Mike, any idiot can make deliveries. I think we both know you're more capable than that. Mate, I want you to think of the last few months as a warm-up. - A trial for the real job. - Yeah, go on. How would you like to earn £1,000 a night? Ed, man, what the fuck is it that you do? Credit cards. - Credit cards? - Yeah. What the fuck do you do with credit cards? Use the credit. You remember about 10 years ago, banks and businesses, encouraged by the government, introduced the chip and PIN system? Mate, that opened up the floodgates for us. You know the chip and PIN pads, the small little things in petrol stations, shops, bars and clubs, you enter your number into, they were sold to the businesses on the premise that they were 100% tamperproof, the idea that if somebody tried to open them up or modify them, they would just shut down and more importantly the customer data would be safe. What they didn't tell anybody was that was a lie. It isn't safe. We found a way to modify the chip and PIN pad so that they record the data without affecting the transaction. I'm gonna show you how. We pay somebody a couple of hundred quid to swap their machine for our machine for a few days whilst it racks up the customer details. We take those details, download them onto a sewer and then put them onto clean cards for us to use. Fucking took you long enough. And it is completely 100% untraceable. We end up with thousands of credit and debit card details which nobody knows have gone missing until after we've swiped one of these magic cards. [Mike] Fucking hell. [Ed] And the geeks put all that information onto blank cards. Yeah, they're all in order, thank you. The hardware is very interesting, I'm sure, but this isn't the Dixons. Thanks. They get a bit possessive. - Jack, how's it going this week? - Yep, good, thank you. All the hardware's in, software's loaded, and we're set for the week, I think, and thank you for the new games console. That's OK, mate. I didn't pay for it. Come on. It always amazes me that they spend all day on a computer and then in the evening wanna relax by playing another computer game. But that's geeks for you. - So, mate, what are you thinking? - What do you do with them? Oh. Dinner and a movie. Sometimes a new pair of shoes. What do you fucking think we do with them? - We withdraw cash from them. - From people's accounts? Or their credit cards. Mate, we withdraw whatever the machine will allow us to withdraw. Anywhere between £250 and £300 a night per card. But then we ditch the card after one use and then we move onto the next one and the next one and so on and so on. - Yeah, it's still theft, mate. - Mike, we're not mugging people. We're not stealing from grannies. We're not walking into a jewellery shop with a shotgun giving somebody a fucking heart attack. The money's all insured. The only people that lose are the fucking banks. They're the biggest cunts of all and you fucking know that. So how are you supposed to get rid of this many cards? It's just you and fucking Dr Spock as far as I can see. Mate, it's a big game and we are a tiny drop in a very large ocean. Look, mate, when you start with us, you'll be a runner. Every team has four runners and a supervisor. I'm the supervisor of this team. Every night you'll take 25 to 30 grand depending on what the machine will let you withdraw. That means I take back 100 to 120 grand every night for my team of four. That team of four is multiplied by another team of four, so every night I drop 200 grand to my boss. - And who's that? - Don't worry about that for now. Mate, all you've gotta do is take 100 cards and empty a couple of cash machines every night, and for that I'm gonna give you £1,000 a night in cash. What do you say? It's money for nothing. Guys, guys, guys. Shut that off. - This is Mike. Mike's the new guy. - What happened to McClurg? He's with another team now, OK? Mike stepped up because of the vacancy. Yeah, but I don't know this guy. They don't this guy either. So excuse my paranoia here, mate. Do us a favour, lift your shirt up. - You're all right. I don't lift shirts. - I'm not fucking kidding. - You need to lift your shirt up. - Get the fuck off me! You prick. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey. Back off, Topbeef. - Lift up your shirt, for fuck's sake. - What? He just wants to see you're not wearing a wire. - I'm not wearing a fucking wire! - Right, so fucking prove it. Mike, please. - You happy now? - Ecs-fucking-tatic. Thank you. Topbeef, get the cards. Get the cards. Come on, ladies, we've got work to do. These cards aren't gonna fucking do themselves. Jamie, you're gonna drive. Dan, stop fucking doing drugs as well. I can smell it in this fucking apartment. What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? - What? - What are you doing? I said let's go. - I'm rolling. - Oh, you're rolling. OK. Well, fucking... Come on, for fuck's sake. - All right, all right. - What are you looking at? Go on. Shouldn't we have a lookout? We're on a main fucking road here. You're using a cash machine. Get on with it. For fuck's sake. [bleeping] Fucking hell, it worked! Don't wave the money around and don't leave the card in the machine. Two rules so basic I failed to mention them on account of them being so fucking obvious. You also don't dance down the street singing, "I've just withdrawn a load of money from a cloned credit card." - Do you understand? - I'm just excited, that's all. You're starting to fucking wind me up, that's what you're doing. Listen, you've got 99 cards left to do and I can't... - Put the fucking money away. - All right, all right, all right. I've got my own machines to do. Fucking dickhead. I'll tell you what, though. I could get fucking used to this. [Mike] Like any job, what at first was exciting soon became routine. The times and places changed, but the job was always the same. No small talk. No "Hi. Howk it going?" Just withdraw as much cash as you can. I was still worried about getting pinched for it, but, like Eddie said, it wasn't like we were mugging old ladies or nothing. He'd always had a reputation for Ending a scam somewhere. At school he found where the dinner ladies threw away the old meal tickets and then sold them back to the other kids at half price. Now he'd found a different kind of meal ticket. This was serious money, and as time went on, we became better mates than we'd ever been back in the old days. He made sure he looked after his team as well. Of course, I was always tempted to skim a lbit off the top, but I knew I had a good thing going and I didn't wanna risk it. Each of us were rinsing 100 cards a night, each one paying out between £250 and £300. That's 25 to 30 grand. Even on a slack night, a team of four was bringing back 100 grand, not to mention the other team that Eddie had running about elsewhere. That's 200 grand he was giving to his boss, who was also taking the same amount from another supervisor. That's 400 grand. Oh, and there's two bosses, meaning whoever was at the top was raking in 800 grand a night, less wages and running costs. I could see why Eddie wanted to check he could trust me before letting me in on this. I was handling more cash then I'd ever seen in my life and it felt like a victimless crime. To be honest, lfelt like Robin fucking Hood. After years of the banks fucking everyone over; it was our turn to take from them. The boys were a bit wary of the new guy at first. But after I saved them from getting their collars felt, I was one of the team and it felt like we'd been working together for years. Jamie was all right but a bit slow. And Dan was far too much of a stoner for Eddie 's liking. Topbeef seemed to have a natural dislike for most people, so was the hardest to win over. But together we had each ether's backs. After every nightk withdrawals, we 'd go out and blow the wages straightaway. Booze and drugs got us through to the mornings. At the weekends, if we weren't kicking the shit out of the opposition, we 'd hire Ferraris on credit against next week's wages. I never thought a grand a night could be spent so quickly. It was one long fucking party. I guess the theory was if we kept drinking, we'd never see the hangover. - Where have you been? - Just don't, babe. - I'm fucking shattered. - Yeah, me too. Who are ya? Who are ya? - Where'd you get this from? - Babe, what are you fucking doing, eh? - Where did you get it from? - it's my wages. - He pays you in cash? - Yes, he fucking pays me in cash. I love you so much. You've changed since you got that job. - I'll work for us both. - I need to be successful. I have to go. - You're trying to fucking leave me. - You've changed since you got that job. Doing what I'm doing, I can give you a better life. Don't worry, mate. There'll always be another one. You'll always get another crack at the whip. Yeah. I just knew what she wanted, you know? I just understood her. What the fuck are you talking about? I'm talking about the score. 1-0. We'll always get another crack at Millwall. - You're such a cock. - Come on, mate. It could be worse. - Oi, I know you. - Mate, fuck off, will you? One of you cunts threw a fucking glass bottle at my mate last week. We're having a fucking conversation here, bruv. Why don't you do yourself a favour and fuck off? Here they come. Oh, great. We've got Tweedledee, Tweedledum. Oi. We ain't finished. [Mike] Eddie was a good mate as well as a good supen/isor. If you were loyal, he'd look after you. But you wouldn't wanna get on his bad side. - Stealing from banks was no problem. - Dan. But once the money was out, Eddie expected it all to go in the bag. Come on. - Are you stealing from me? - [Mike] Ed, what the fuck you doing? What the fuck? Can you believe this shit? You stealing from us? Piece of fucking junk. Fucking stealing? Fucking stupid fucking cunt. All right, mate, all right! He's done! Ed, he's done! He's done, mate! Fucking hell. [Mike] It was plain to see that people shouldn't get too greedy. Fuck. Every now and then, Eddie fancied a change of venue. We'd do jobs all over the country, but we also went international. Boys, good to see you busy. Fucking hell, boys. A bottle of wine, double bed. - A bit suspect, innit? - Not the only thing that's suspect. I can smell fucking weed halfway down the corridor. What are you trying to do, draw attention to us? Topbeef, bag the rest of that up and we'll go and see the money mover. In fact, you won't. You're gonna go and get us tickets for the match tonight. - Good seats. - You got it. Guys, what if somebody from housekeeping sees all these cards and cash? No one comes in here, mate, I promise. Nobody from housekeeping came in. Look at the fucking state of the place. We're trying to keep a low profile, which is... [phone rings] Who has this room number? Topbeef, have you given the number to anyone? - Fuck off. - [ringing continues] Hello? Have one of you cunts ordered room service? - No. - No. Have one of you cunts ordered room service? - Yes. - Yes. And where's room service gonna get delivered to? Oh, yeah, to your room. They're not hungry. Fucking get it together, guys. Get this place cleaned up. Get your cards done in two hours when we're back. - Jamie, don't let him smoke anything. - I won't. You're not my fucking parents. I smoke what I fucking want. I am your fucking dad. I fucked your mum 18 years ago and now look at the problem I've got. And don't get pinched. [Mike] You can't just walk a bag of cash through customs. On jobs abroad, Eddie always used a local money mover. Drop the cash with him, and his mate back in the UK gives you the same amount minus his 10% fee. It may be a little costly, but it was worth the price to keep things flowing. - What, you not staying? - I'm not staying. I'm the supervisor. I can't stay around watching you learn to suck cock all my life. I'm only here for the fucking football, to be honest. Oh, which reminds me. If we've got shit tickets, dude, when I gave you a bunch load of money, with money-no-object rules attached to it... I don't wanna be sitting in a wheelchair pit or fucking behind a pillar or right up at the fucking back... Ed, I've got something to tell you, mate. - What? - I could only get one. - One what? - One ticket. I sent you to a ticket tout. The geezer you hooked me up with, he said he can only get one. He said they were like gold dust. - You got one ticket to the match? - Yes. The geezer you set me up with... - You probably went too late. - Listen, don't get pissy about it. - Of course it's gold dust! - it's not gonna make a ticket appear! - Are you done? - Yes, I'm done. - Can I have my ticket, please? - Right, and how does that work? Because I gave you a bunch of money to get two tickets, you get... It works because I'm your boss. Give me the ticket. Listen, this is fucking football. it's not work, right? - Don't pull rank on me. - I'm not... Right, OK. - We will flip for it. - What? We're gonna flip for it. Flip, flip. Get a coin. We'll flip. Let me teach you one of life's lessons. Fate isn't gonna be on your side today. - Fine. Heads or tails? - Heads. - Fuck you! - Pow! Now, get me my fucking credit cards. Bet you wish you were at that fucking football match. Would you please fuck off? Don't you have something better to be doing? - Been doing it. - You done already? Yep. There you go. - Oh, marvellous. - And there... are the used ones. - You'll be wanting some more, then. - Could do with a beer, I tell you. - Well, take this lot. - Fucking hell. - Look at this. Amateur hour. - Don't get the fucking hump with me. I mean it. You can do that with Mike. Don't do that with me. I'm your fucking supervisor. Pick up the fucking cards. When you get back to the hotel, you're gonna sort out which ones are done. For fuck's sake. Just run some interference, for fuck's sake. - All right, boys? What's happening? - [speak French] Don't you fucking look lovely in your little blue suits, eh? [speak French] In fact, ask them what the fucking score is on the football match I should be at. Do you know the football score for tonight? - Eddie, mate, fucking hurry up. - Five more seconds. I can't understand a fucking word you boys are saying, mate. Don't fucking touch, you fucking French little ponce. - I've got it. Go, go. - Bollocks. [siren wails] Fuck. - That was fucking close. - That was too fucking close. - Did you see his face? - Those fucking gendarmes, mate. They can fucking move, can't they? - Fuck. I dropped the fucking bag. - Forget it, mate. Forget the bag. I can't forget the bag. it's got a fucking shit load of cards and cash. - I'll go and call the boss. - No, fuck the boss. We'll go back to the hotel, pick up some more cards... Let me make a call. Fuck. Don't call the boss. - The key card. - What? - The hotel key card. - I gave it to you. -I know you did. I put it in the bag. - Don't tell me you put it in the bag. I put the card in the fucking bag. it's in the fucking bag. - What the fuck is the matter with you? - Fuck. Jesus fucking Christ. Call Dan and Jamie and tell them to get out the hotel. Tell them to go back to London. I don't fucking care how. - Hello, Jamie. - Get back to London. Yeah, listen, mate. it's... it's Topbeef here, son. We've got a bit of a situation, mate. Cool, cool. OK. Police could be on their way, mate. - Get the fuck out of here. - Shit. [loud cheering] Mike. Call me when you leave the game. Don't go back to the hotel. Fuck. Fuck. - Have you got your passport? - Yeah. It's time to fucking get out of here. Come on, come on. Go. Police! Fuck! And that's how I ended up sentenced to 18 months in a French prison. Fuck off! it's the middle of the night! [man] You have a visitor. All right. Cinq minutes. Hi. Hi. - I wasn't expecting to see you. - I bet. I assume the platinum blondes haven't visited? No. No one has. Eddie came to visit me. He said they were taking care of you as much as they could. Said I shouldn't worry about you. - Did it help? - Not really. At that point I had no idea you were doing 18 months in a French prison. I thought you were on holiday or something, spending your new wealth. So, yeah, I did get worried. Yeah, well, don't. They're sending me stuff. I'm sure they're keeping you happy with everything you need to get through this. But are they gonna look after you when you get out? - They have been so far. - They are the reason you are in here. You could be out tomorrow if you just tell the police... That's not how it works, Katie. Mike, spare me the "honour among thieves" bullshit. At some point you've gotta put yourself above them. I just hope when you do, it's not too late. For you and for us. [Mike] This had been the longest six months of my life. Not helped by regular visits from the same French copper asking the same questions over and over every day. How did you get the cards? I've told you a million times. I bought them off a guy in London. He was white, medium height, medium build. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You told me. And you're lying. And you're not even doing it inventively. I'm not lying. His name's John Smith. Why don't you go and look him up in a fucking phone book? Turns out they didn't wanna keep me in for the full stretch. After six months they fucked me oft back to the London. Result. You wanna take these things off? I'm on a fucking train. I'm not gonna go anywhere, am I? Until you leave this train in the UK, you're still my prisoner and you will wear those handcuffs, okey-doke? If you wanna eat, do your best. If you wanna shit, shit in your pants. Otherwise just shut up. You French. Such a friendly fucking nation. Credit card fraud. Do a lot of time for that. - Already done my birthday in Paris. - Who said anything about Paris? It's the only place I've committed these crimes. So unless you've got evidence to the contrary, you can charge me. Otherwise I ain't saying another word until I see a fucking brief. [voicemail bleeps] [Mike] Eddie, my son, guess who's back in town. Yeah, I know, takes more than a French prison to keep me. They dropped me off at the local nick, so do me a favoun come by, pick me up. Fucking prick! What did we tell you? Shit! You should fucking know! I told you not to fucking steal. You fucking did it anyway, huh? What did you fucking do that for? Huh? What did you do it for? Look at him. Look at him. The man himself. Well, well, well, well, well. - Hello, mate. - How you doing, mate? - Good holiday? - Non. - Ah. Parlez-vous frangais now? - Un peu. - Man, it's good to see you, mate. - Good to see you too, Eddie. - So, much sex inside? - Your mum popped in for a conjugal. - You know how it goes. - Oh! I was wondering what you were doing whilst you missed the FA Cup Final. Fuck you, man. I'm gutted about that. It kick off? - Big time. You would have loved it. - I bet. Jump in. Somebody wants to say hello. Oh, by the way, does French cock taste the same as English? You'd fucking know, son. - How's everyone anyway? - Yeah, good. Topbeef's running his own teams. Dan's dead. Jamie's still running. - Dan's dead? - Yeah, overdose. Kind of had it coming. [man] What the fuck do you mean, he can't get blood out of a stone? Who the fuck said you're made of stone? Right. OK, I'll catch you later. This him? Mr Jacobs. Nice to see you. Heard a lot about you. Oh, yeah? Cheers. So who are you, then? - Face looks a bit familiar. - Mike, this is Mr Robinson. I'm your employer. What, Scotty Robinson? You run the firm, mate. You're a fucking legend. [laughs] - it's Mr Robinson. - Yeah, course. But, yeah, you're right. Back in the good old days I was Scotty Robinson. The guv'nor, the boss. [sighs] But the last time I was away, I realised that the people I was doing my bird with were earning bundles of dough, not getting their hands dirty and doing a lot less time than I was. So when I got out, I decided to play it smarter, not so hard. Mind you, anyone fucks with my family, my business or me, I revert back to Scotty Robinson just like that. But these days I leave the terraces to the likes of you. So, what, the bosses report back to the firm heads now? - Including me now. - What, you're a boss? A vacancy occurred, and naturally Eddie stepped up. Mike, we want you to come and work for us again, this time be a supervisor, take a step up, run your own team. Yeah? It's our way of rewarding you for your loyalty if you like. Keeping your gob shut. Not putting us in it. - it's more money. - More responsibility. - Be just like old times, mate. - You'll answer directly to Eddie here. What do you say? Yeah, fuck it, I'm in. But before you accept, I've got a little question for you. Yeah, what's that? What's your take on the 1988 FA Cup Final? It's important. It's important to me. To be honest, Mr Robinson, I was only eight. Our team went out. Who else you gonna support? London club. Wimbledon. Just wish I was a bit older to put a bet on. Fuck the Scousers, eh? Fuck the Scousers, eh? Fuck the Scousers. Alex. That's a good answer. Take it. You're gonna need it. You've become a real target now. Listen to me. In here, we're all a team. Outside, different kettle of fish. Dangerous. Take care. I wanna ask you something. Why didn't you come and visit me in jail? - Mikey, were you feeling unloved? - I'm fucking serious. I was there six months. I didn't hear a fucking thing from you. I'm not the letter-writing type, babe. Anyway, I'm here now, aren't I, hmm? I always knew you'd come back so we could carry on the party. [voicemail bleeps] [Ed] Mike, I've gotta say, mate, it% like you never left. Hn glad you Te settling back in. Listen, the Newcastle lot called me. They've got a bag full of lovely money, so get your arse up there. Give us a buzz when you get back. Throw us the fucking bag now! [shouting] Fuck! Fucking kill him! Shit! Let him have it! - Come on! We've got the money! Let's go! - Come on. We've got money coming in from Berlin tomorrow, Paris the day after. The money mover's charging us 10% at the moment. - We can drop that to 8% if we... - [phone buzzes] I'm sorry. Just one sec. Mike, how you doing? Can I call you back? Slight problem with Mike. Get him back here now. Then I pulled out my gun and tried to shoot him. Oh. You tried to shoot him? [Mike] I don't know how to use it. I'm not a gangster. I'm a white-collar fraudster who's been given a gun. Look, I don't know who they were, but they were nothing to do with me, OK? All right. I believe you. I'm glad. Whoever robbed you knew exactly where you were gonna be and that you were carrying that money. Not a lot of people knew that. Yeah. Right. Don't trust anyone. This will not happen again. To get robbed once is unlucky. To get robbed twice is fucking careless. So from now on, you will be totally responsible for every penny you lose. Got it? Yeah, I got it. One more thing. The big match on Saturday. Who you got your money on? United. it's a no-brainer. Oh, no, not this time. If I were you, I'd try putting my money on the underdog. You might get a pleasant surprise. Cheers. Fuck! - Take it easy, Mike. Take it easy. - How am I supposed to take it easy? Look, mate, you just need something to relax. Here, look. - Take a little toot on that, OK? - Fuck, look at me. I'm shaking. Just make sure it doesn't happen again. I'm gonna have to now. Otherwise I'm gonna end up in the fucking Thames! Mate, just be a bit more alert, OK? Keep your head down and you'll be fine. I've gotta get out of here, and I need to stop doing this fucking shit! Mike, you can't leave. You leave now, it looks like you staged the robbery. - I don't care! I don't fucking care! - Well, you should care, Mike. I was fucking shot at today. Do you understand what that means? I was fucking shot at! And now that cunt, he wants to fucking kill me! I'm gonna fucking go and get what I've earned, I'm gonna get back with Katie and go and get the fuck out of this fucking shit. I'm over my head, Ed! You can't leave, Mike. What did you think was gonna happen? You think you can just hand in your notice and these guys will give you a reference? It doesn't work like that, Mike! Play the long game. Be a bit smart here, mate. If you're gonna disappear, you've gotta do it quickly. And if you're gonna fuck off, you may as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb. - I don't know what the fuck that means. - It means we should wait, Mike. We should wait until it's worth leaving. You're not the only person in over your head, Mike. Dan didn't die of an overdose. He got greedy. [gunshot] - You fucking killed him! - I didn't kill him but I saw it happen! And I couldn't do anything! Listen to me. The boss trusts me. He trusts me. Every week he's getting me to move larger and larger sums of money. Every week. I'm talking two million quid. Every week I've got two million quid. Every week, in my hands. So if you're serious about going, what I'm saying to you is let's pick the moment. We should get back. Yeah, go on. I'll be all right. Jesus fucking Christ. [Ed] Listen, mate, just make sure you hold Hre over what we talked about. I promised Katie Pd look after you and that's exactiy what Pm gonna do. We just have to pick the right time. Oh, you fucking dick. [phone buzzes] - Hello? - [man] Hello, mate. You all right? - Who's that? - it% your favourite busy copper. You haven't backed a rotten, have you 7 - Where the fuck are you? - Never you mind. What d'you want? I'm just making sure you ain't spent all your money on the gee-gees. I wouldn't want you to run out. I'm not doing anything illegal any more, so get the fuck off my phone, stop harassing me. It's all right, fella. I'm not harassing you. I'm just letting you know that time's running out. Yeah? How d'you figure that? Look, if you just want someone to look after you, I just wanna let you know, well, you know, I'm here. Witness protection? You out of your fucking mind, mate? Well, if you change your mind, you know where I am. Thanks for the offer. I'm all right where I am. Yeah, I'm sure you are. Fuck. What's up? What's up is I just sprayed liquid soap onto my crotch in the bathroom, so now it looks like I've spunked myself. No, I meant with the text. Uh... it's happening. Robinson wants to move a whole lot of cash next week. Wants me to take it to a port up in Scotland. And I am not gonna do it. - What? - This is our chance, mate. This is our way to get out. Let's fuck off to Rio. Stash what we can for the next week and go. You're fucking mad, mate. What if we got caught? If we get caught, I've got a horrible feeling we find out what our testicles taste like, but we're not because it's just me and it's just you, nobody to fuck it up for us. Just get your shit together. We've got a week. After the Cup Final tomorrow, I'll sort everything out. The Cup Final. That reminds me. I only managed to get one ticket. - Fuck off. No, fuck off. -I know, mate. Genuinely. - Ticket tout ran out of tickets. - Yeah, I bet he did, yeah. I genuinely could only get one. Mind you, the one ticket is in the executive box. I know what you're doing. This is fucking Paris all over again. - I could genuinely only get one ticket. - We'll flip for it. - We're not flipping for anything. - We'll flip for it. Last time you ended six months inside a Paris jail. - You wanna do that again? - No. - I've got a job for you anyway. - What's that? A collection. You've gotta go up north. Get some credit-card cloning equipment that Robinson lent a firm up north. They've held onto it a week longer than they should. He's just getting a bit pissy about it. Just need somebody to get it. OK, that's fantastic. So while I'm doing this, you're going to the Cup Final. That's fucking fair? Do you wanna be a hooligan all your life or do you wanna be a winner? - Yeah, a winner. - Really? I'm gonna be a football hooligan, you loser. Ooh, important call. Hold on one second. Fucking dickhead. Well, what d'you think? I don't know if I can just leave like that. Baby, please. I'm trying to get out of this. And if you're with me, I think I can do it. Sorry, Mike. I think you've gotta do this one alone. [Nicey Pricey] Hang on! Fuck me. What, heavy night, was it? Yeah, something like that. What time is it? It's just a bit before midday. What, did I get you out of bed? - Yeah. - Can I come in for a sec? Um... Yeah, come in. So what do I owe the early morning wake-up call to? Do you wanna move to another country with me? What? I said do you wanna move to another country with me? No. OK. You're not even gonna think about it? I've given it enough consideration. I don't wanna move to another country with you as much as I don't wanna marry you. "We" are not an "us", Mike. Yeah, well, I just thought, like. Look, I don't know what trouble you're in or soon to be in, but I don't want a part of it. I don't want nothing to do with it. - Yeah. Just in it for good times, then? - Come on. Don't act all hurt and surprised. You knew what I was about the first time you met me. You came into this with eyes wide open. My money and your tits. Suppose that was the deal. You know, I don't even know what I was fucking thinking. I just... it's just nice to have someone, you know? Yeah, I get that, but that someone ain't me, babe. Let me ask you something. What's my name? - Nicey Pricey. - What's my real name? You just asked someone you don't know their proper name to go and live abroad with 'em. It's not me you should be asking. - Well, she said no. - Course she's gonna say no. Any girl that actually is in love with you is gonna make you fight for it. What do you mean? Classy girls cost more than a Bacardi Breezer, Mike. So you think I can persuade her? Yeah. Well, we had some fun, didn't we? We did have some fun times. We had some very fun times, and I am gonna miss you. But... you need to go and talk to the girl you should be talking to, not me. Go on. Hey, babe, it's me. Could you give me a call back when you get this, please? I was just hoping we could talk. I've come to realise I don't need all this in my life. I just need you. Please call me back. I love you. - What? - What? I'm here for the goods. - What d'you fucking mean, what? - Come in. Make yourself a cup of tea! I'm not fucking having this. You lot are taking the fucking piss. - Now, where's the fucking gear? - Shut up, eh? Why don't you fucking shut up, all that yapping? What, you think you're getting it back? it's my gear now. I need it. And you can go fuck yourselves if you think you're getting it back. - Do you know who you're fucking with? - I know exactly who I'm fucking with. You're just a Londoner who thinks he's a big man. But let me tell you something. That equipment is mine and the money in all the cash machines around the country is ours. And if they want you back, they're gonna have to pay for you, big time. So I do hope you're sweet with your boss. Chaps. [Mike yells] [Mike] Eddie, its me. These lot want half a million or theyTe gonna kill me. Just get Robinson to pay, all right? Please. [man] That's enough! I want these out of here now. I've got a big function here tonight, don't want them around. Sure. When you get to the docks, you'll be phoned by a man called Gerrard. He'll tell you where to meet him. When you've made the drop, call me. Something else? Scotty... Mr Robinson. It's been nearly a week. I just wondered if we were gonna try and get Mike back. I don't pay ransoms, 'cause if I did, you'd all be far more vulnerable then you already are. Now, you wouldn't want that, would you? No, course not. But I'll get our kit back, promise you that, and I'll make them soppy fuckers that took it regret ever messing with us. I just, you know, I thought we were part of a team. Now, don't be a silly boy. You'll be telling me next that there's no "l" in T-E-A-M. He's gone. Got it? Right. Now, please get this stuff out of here. Fuck me? No, fuck you. Fuck you. I'll tell... I'll fucking kill him. Now, you tell me, what is with your fucking cheap-arse crew, eh? I fucking told 'em I've got ya and if they want you back they're gonna have to pay. Do you know what they said? Keep him. Fucking keep him. I mean, what kind of fucked-up shit is that? Your muggy little pals had better pay up. Otherwise I'm gonna chop you to bits, my son. - Fuck you. - Fuck you? You fucking bastard! Who the fuck are you talking to? Shut your fucking face. Shut your fucking face up. You fucking... Sorry, Mike. Fucking cunts. Fucking cunts! You work for fucking cunts who are not willing to pay a decent ransom like normal people. I mean, why send us you? Why not send us someone they fucking liked? As it is, you're useless... ...worthless, and there's no need for you to be here any more. It's time to get rid of you. [screams] Now, you're lucky you're still breathing. [heart beats] [man, indistinct] Get this ambulance prepped and ready for operation. [man 2] ...do say will be given in evidence. Do you understand? Listen, you can hardly go back to Robinson now, can you, eh? He knows you were fucking in bed with Eddie. He ain't fucking stupid, fella. What happened with all that money, eh? What did Eddie do with it? 'Cause he didn't fucking help you out, did he? Didn't get you out of there. No. That must have felt a right kick in the bollocks, eh? I mean, it's not exactly loyal, is it? - No comment. - What do you want me to do, eh? You want me to fucking drive you back there, drop you off? Is that what you want? I'll fucking do it. I ain't got a problem with that. - No comment. - Listen, don't be a cunt, all right? There is no fucking point in you keeping your mouth shut. I know it all, all right? You got two options. You either go back there and I'll give you 24 hours and you'll be fucking dead, do you hear me? Or you nark him up, I'll put you on a witness protection, give you a new ID, I'll ship you out somewhere fucking miles away and you can live your life. Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Listen, I know what I'd fucking do. No comment. You think I'm winding you up, don't you? [shouting on tape] [Ed] Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey. Back off, Topbeefl - Lift up your shirt, for fuck's sake. - [Mike] What? [Ed] He just wants to see you Te not wearing a wire. - lin not wearing a fucking wire! - [Ed] Right, so lift your shirt up now. Mike, please. That's Eddie. Detective Church, d'you wanna come in, come and say hello? I bet you didn't see this one coming, did ya? Oh, Mike. Look at the fucking state of you, mate. Don't tell me. You fell down some stairs. Now, seriously, though, Mike, I think you're all right. Which is why what I'm about to say to you comes not as a police officer but someone that wants to help you. So why don't you do yourself a solid, take witness protection and testify? It's the only way you're gonna see 30, mate. Now, I've got a strong case, ready to go, but your testimony will make it watertight. Everyone'll go down. There'll be no one left to come after you. And by the time they do finally get out, you would have been a different person, living in a different place, for years. And this is the best and only option you're gonna get, mate. [Church] We've got some good news and some bad news. The good news is we've got dozens of runners, a load of supervisors and several bosses. The important thing, with your testimony, they'll all go down for a very, very long time. Unfortunately, though, we couldn't get the people right at the top. Some of the top boys have disappeared. What? So I've gotta spend the rest of my life looking over my fucking shoulder now? No, don't you worry about that. We'll sort that out now. Yeah, well, you fucking better had. Well, you're gonna go with my colleague and he's gonna take you to a safe house. You're gonna wait there until we sort a few things out. Then you're gonna get relocated. All right. I need to go somewhere first, OK? God, I fucking love this place. You win some... you lose some. No, mate. It's not about the winning and losing. it's all about the fight. So where did it all go wrong? When I stopped being a hooligan. Fucking Eddie. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for him. I'll be sure to tell him that if I ever see him again. Your new identity's a national secret. Even regular police and passport control don't know the difference. You can go anywhere you want now, Mike. Just so long as it's not round here. So where do you wanna go, then? [voicemail bleeps] Mike, it 'S Eddie. Listen, mate, Hn sorry I had to bail. Hn sorry I couldn't get you out of there, but, look, if you Te hearing this message, I think you know where I want you to go. The code hasn't changed, nor has my intention to look after you. Just do me a favoun will you? If you get out of this, stay in during Cup Finals, will you? [bleeps] Hi. - Got what you needed? - Yep. Just the essentials. - Vous avez Hni? - Oui, merci. Cash or card? [rap music]
