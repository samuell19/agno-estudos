Zishan. Don't you have something important to tell me? Why don't you talk? We've known each other for three years. You have never been this gloomy. What's wrong? Jinghong. Why don't we just get out of here? Why are you just standing? Let's go. Zishan, let's move! Zishan! THE LONG-HAIRED WOMAN APPROACHES THEM INCH BY INCH ZISHAN REMAINS ALOOF THE LAST CHAPTER JINGHONG SAGA Hello? Hello? Have you read it? The last chapter. Yes, I have. That's too weird. Who wrote this sequel to our novel? Isn't it one of the guys we know? No, I asked them all. No one did it. Since we decided to delete this work three years ago, no one wrote anything to it or even logged in that BBS again. Then who on earth wrote this? Come on. Forget it. Which passage have you read to? I left off here, "On a beautiful night, a woman with long hair walks over," and so on. It was so scary. That's why I called. And then? And then, "Somehow, Zishan is completely frozen. So I... So Jinghong runs away on her own." Zishan! Zishan! "And then, Jinghong ran into a derelict hospital." A derelict hospital? What brings a derelict hospital and a beautiful night together? Who knows. Jinghong. Jinghong. Hello? Help! Stay back! Don't come closer! Stay back! Keep away! Hello? Nuo. Can I come to your place for the night? Sister? What's up? I'm a bit frightened. I want to see you now. What's wrong? I just read a particularly scary novel. I dare not sleep now. A novel? I thought it was something worse. Tomorrow... No, today, I'm going to an open class by Professor Tong of your college. See you in class. Nuo. Please. My parents have gone on a trip. I was really scared home alone. You yourself write weird novels, too. Why so scared? Well, yes, but... I keep feeling someone watching me. Okay, okay, the future novelist, put away your imagination and hurry to... Nuo. Hello? Tang Jing. THE PERILOUS INTERNET RING A HELPING HAND Everyone, there is a very interesting example. If you want someone to like you, what should you do? None of them works. The best way to let others like you is not that you go help them, but that you let them help you. I give you this example just for encouraging you to go out, rather than being an otaku clinging to the computer. That's a cliche. Sir, please don't talk about something widely spread online, okay? Just for your reputation, I skipped my internship to attend your lecture. Humans are evolving. So are devils. With the ongoing development of computerization, ghosts and spirits are also developing along with computers. These are your words, right? That's right. I did say that. For example, a beggar used to beg money with a bowl before him. But now, he could add a QR code. As a graduate student of Nanjiang University, you claimed there are ghosts in the world. Is that how you grow famous? Ma Ming. I didn't say there are ghosts. That was just a metaphor. It was my article published in the campus newspaper that led to misunderstandings. I have to give a detailed explanation on this part. Okay, I'm all ears. Actually, my point is... I'll talk about it after class. Nowadays, news and reports can be seen everywhere about the Internet addiction of college students, which is obviously now the focus of attention of the whole society. Hello, you've come to our school especially for this class. Why are you so absent-minded? How did you know that? Why don't you answer? Because I have never seen you, and this, too. Tang Jing. Tang Jing. Take it down. Upper cut, 7.8 cm long. Lower cut, 8.2 cm long. How do you feel? Better now? Sure. May I ask you a few questions? Did your cousin has depression or any unfavorable relationship? She was always cheerful. Plus, she never had a boyfriend. Nuo. Mom. Tang Jing can't end herself. All right, don't think too much. Get some rest now. It can't be. She can't end herself. Mom, you don't think so, right? Leave it to the police, okay? Ma Ming. You are... Oh, the girl yesterday. My cousin Tang Jing said that Ma Ming, the famous geek student in her university, is proficient in psychology, criminal investigation, and supernatural theory. Not really. Tang Jing. Sounds so familiar! Oh, she's in the literature department. She said she wanted to be a novelist, and she came with her friend to do an interview with me, seeking to turn my story into a novel, which was quite embarrassing. This is my first time having an interview with someone. So I'm a bit nervous. Well, just a casual talk will be all right. Let me introduce myself. I'm Tang Jing. She was supposed to attend the class yesterday. Why didn't she? Is she all right? She... My cousin, she... She killed herself. But I don't believe so. Normally, one will commit suicide by slitting their wrist. But she decided to cut her throat. Okay, after the first cut was done, that must hurt so much. What gave her the courage to make the second cut? In other words, someone else cut her. I'm just suspecting. Did she offend anyone? Probably... not. It's strange then. Since there's no trace of the murderer and it doesn't seem like a suicide... There's only one possibility then. What's that? Ghosts. Do you really know about your cousin? Have you ever read the book titledThe Dogs of Babel? Most of the time, we thought we know about each other. However, even the closest ones don't necessarily know about you. Why did Jing go that extreme? JINGHONG, LIULI, AND MING TOGETHER SHAO NA OF COURSE NOT WE DECIDED TO STOP WRITING IT THREE YEARS AGO, DIDN'T WE? YUP... THEN WHY DID YOU GO TO THAT BBS? NO, I DIDN'T. IT WAS A STRANGER WHO SENT ME THIS LINK VIA QQ I ASKED WHO HE WAS. HE DIDN'T TELL IT MIGHT BE THEIR PRANK SHOW IT TO ME NOW PASSWORD: LASTCHAPTER Fallen Star Tower? FALLEN STAR TOWER ENTER PASSWORD LASTCHAPTER THE LAST CHAPTER JINGHONG SAGA Nuo. "We'll talk tomorrow..." Nuo. Mom. Did you just call me? Nope. "Zishan looks at Jinghong's face with a brief hesitation and then a puzzled look grabs him. Zishan, don't you have something important to tell me? Jinghong stares at Zishan, awaiting his answer." Am I tired? Nuo! What's wrong, girl? What's wrong? What's wrong? Nothing. I had a nightmare. Can you call that nothing? You yelled so loudly, you know? Shall I take you to hospital for a checkup? I'm okay. Perhaps the sight of what happened to Tang Jing was too much of a shock for me. Don't be afraid. Tony, look here. Tony. Now, look there. Look there. From now on, we're able to see Tony even when we're out. Are you listening to me? Honey. We knew each other just through this web fiction,Fallen Star Tower. I'm now reading it. Fallen Star Tower? Didn't we delete it three years ago? But someone sent me a link today. It turned out to be Fallen Star Tower. A last chapter was updated. Let me check. What's wrong? A little bit dizzy. Then go to sleep. I want to read more. Don't stay up too late. I know. Go ahead. Zishan. Zishan. Zishan, save us! Who's that long-haired woman? Run! "Ming killed Liuli. And then Ming killed himself." That is, I killed my wife. Jiang Qiong. Honey. Did you call me? THE LAST CHAPTER MING AND LIULI SAGA Back off! Back off! Back off! Darling! Back off! Darling! Honey! Did he end his wife first and then committed suicide? Captain. There's a reporter outside who claims to be your friend. He's here to see you. My friend? Let's go. Captain Li! It's Mr. Zhang. What are you doing? Step back! Well, he's the new intern. Things are in bad shape. Don't take unwanted photos. Later, I'll have the press release sent to you. Okay. Press release is boring. The audience love exclusives. Enough with that. What were the victims' names? The victims... The man should be... Jiang Qiong. The woman was... Let me see. Su Xiaojing. -Right? -Su Xiaojing. Su Xiaojing. Let me introduce myself. My name's Tang Jing. This is my senior, Su Xiaojing. Hello. I'm Su Xiaojing. Nice to meet you. You want to see me? Liuli and Ming? Why do you have this photo of them? It's a press release photo today. Do you know them? They should be my cousin's online friends. Online friends? I saw their photos at Tang Jing's place. Their real names are Su Xiaojing and Jiang Qiong. And this Su Xiaojing, together with your cousin, had an interview with me. They both... died today. What? So Liuli and Ming are their screen names? Yes. They set up a BBS together. Online, they wrote a fiction calledFallen Star Tower. Have you read it? That day, after you asked whether I really know about my cousin, I went to check her computer. In the novelFallen Star Tower, Tang Jing represents Jinghong. Jiang Qiong represents Ming. Su Xiaojing is Liuli. Besides, there are Zishan, Shengzhou, and Ruxin. Are there anyone else? I have no idea. The novel saved in Tang Jing's computer only have these characters. Or there could be others, but not in the part she wrote. Don't you find it weird? The style of the last chapter is completely different from what your cousin had written. It was in ancient times, but is now in modern times. A time travel theme or what? I don't know. The original was deleted. Without the whole picture, we can't jump to conclusion. Are they in the last chapter? Yes. All in all, the latest update is just about the death of Liuli and Ming. Did the three of them die... in the same way as those in the last chapter? If ghosts exist, the answer is yes. Let's report it to the police. How are you going to tell them? Like ghosts really exist? Tang Jing and Jiang Qiong committed suicide. With regard to the last chapter, did Tang Jing talk to anyone? SHAO NA OF COURSE NOT. WE DECIDED TO STOP WRITING IT THREE YEARS AGO, DIDN'T WE? YUP... THEN WHY DID YOU GO TO THAT BBS? Someone named Shao Na. She could be a writer of Fallen Star Tower too. Will you contact her then? FALLEN STAR TOWER Yes. Shao Na... might be Ruxin in the novel. You're right! Zishan and Shengzhou are male. Yes! Tang Jing's cousin? HELLO, I'M TANG JING'S COUSIN EXCUSE ME I'M WONDERING ARE YOU RUXIN IN FALLEN STAR TOWER? Yes. Did Tang Jing tell you about that? Sure enough! Shao Na is Ruxin. MY COUSIN IS DEAD Tang Jing is dead. How could it be? JIANG QIONG AND SU XIAOJING ARE DEAD, TOO Jiang Qiong and Su Xiaojing are dead, too? When was that? How was that? I want to talk to you face to face. Shao Na says she wants to talk face to face at once. Let's go! Great. If we can meet Shao Na, we will certainly learn more. What's wrong? I heard someone calling me. No one was calling you. Brother Charlie. Yeah. It's just tomorrow. What's wrong with you? Nuo... Hey. Zhou Xiaonuo! Zhou Xiaonuo, calm down! Nuo... Why? She was just there. Where? What are you talking about? Zhou Xiaonuo! Nuo... Zhou Xiaonuo. Zhou Xiaonuo! Zhou Xiaonuo! Pull yourself together! There's nobody around! Sober up! Zhou Xiaonuo! Sober up! It's all right! You're all right! Get out of my way! Are you okay? Ma Ming. I'M HERE. WHERE ARE YOU NOW? Ma Ming. What was going on? Why did you hit her? She was haunted. What? Haunted? That's sheer nonsense. Let alone those eye-catching theories you always put forward in the campus. How can you take this as the excuse after you hit her? You don't understand what the whole thing is about. I can't make it clear to you. Why not? Professor Tong. It's not like that. You're mistaken about him. I came to Ma Ming... because of my cousin Tang Jing. Professor Tong. You wanted to see me? She got injured. Take her to have a checkup. All right. Come with me then. FALLEN STAR TOWER NOVEL FALLEN STAR TOWER FALLEN STAR TOWER FALLEN STAR TOWER LAST CHAPTER RUXIN SAGA Ruxin Saga? It's my turn. NEBULA NET CAFE Did you really see a long-haired woman approaching you? Yes. That was a really scary woman. Although her face was hidden behind her long hair, I can still feel her fierce glare. It's kinda like... killing people by a curse. Did things get strange only after you read the last chapter? Yes. The cursed web fiction. People related to Fallen Star Tower, one by one, were cursed to death. All right. Sorry, the subscriber you have dialed is powered off. It's off. THE LAST CHAPTER What's going on? Shao Na... Xia Weiyi. Is it you, Xia Weiyi? Shao Na... Who are you? Zishan? Help! Help me! JIU ZI PARK Someone jumped off a building! Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. It's Shao Na. What? Let's go. Ma Ming. Will I die... as they did? Let me have a read of it too. No way. Do you really think you're cursed by the web fiction? LASTCHAPTER Wait. Are you really fine with it? If something goes wrong with you, no one will be able to help me. How about if you read it? I'm listening. With the bright moon and dotted stars, illuminated neon lights are embedded in the starry sky within reach, spreading all over. Colorful lights adorn the flickering shadow on the river. As the ship passes with a long toot, and gradually disappears in the distance... LIU LI, LET'S GO LAST CHAPTER RUXIN SAGA there appeared a blood-colored shadow, like words in the sky. Done. Are you all right? I'm fine. And you? Are you doing good? Should be all right. As expected, it's okay to listen to others read. Death from falling off a building. It was the same as Shao Na's death. Let's go to the police. POLICE STATION You said you had the illusion of that woman only after you read the novel Fallen Star Tower? Yes. Besides, the four of them all died in the same way as those in the novel. Whenever there's an update of a character, the person is dead. Look. SORRY, PAGE NOT FOUND... What's wrong? How come it's gone? I could read it just now. Zhou Xiaonuo. What do you want? I... Tang Jing didn't commit suicide. I just want to prove this. Thanks very much for providing us clues. But you should remember this: crime investigation is the job of the police force. If you follow your own clues to track the suspect, there would be unexpected risks. Go back. Leave this case alone. Captain. The rest of them must be found asap. Yes. SHAO NA Tang Jing, Jiang qiong, Su Xiaojing and Shao Na. They're all dead. The rest of them should be in danger too. Can you... leave this to us? Yes. Yes. What? A cursed web fiction? That's funny. Get me the security video footages of the Jiang's and Shao Na in the net caf?e. Yes, sir. Why is Fallen Star Tower gone again? Is it my illusion? It's not an illusion. Someone must have found out and thus deleted it. Who could it be, then? It can only be left to the police's investigation. Hello? I got it. I got it. Right away. What's wrong? Nuo... Nuo? What is it? Did you see the long-haired woman? She's coming over! She's coming this way! Nuo, it's an illusion. Nuo! Where am I? I'm in the hospital. What? How come I'm in the hospital? Nuo! Get up, Nuo! Zhou Xiaonuo. Cheer up! I can't make it. Zhou Xiaonuo! Nuo! Couldn't see clearly what was on the computer. But indeed they were reading something. What did Shao Na say? According to the staff of the net caf?e, this is what Shao Na said: "Xia Weiyi. Is it you?" Xia Weiyi. Shengzhou. Zishan. Xia Weiyi. Then what's the connection between Nuo's illusion of a long-haired woman and Xia Weiyi? Mu. Check out who Xia Weiyi is. Yes, sir. Jiaxu. Check out the real name and address of Shengzhou and Zishan. Yes, sir. Here. Nuo. Thank goodness! She's awake. Mom. Dad. Where's Ma Ming? Your schoolmate sent you home and then left. Lie down. -Be good? -Where are you going? Have a good rest at home. You asked whether one can hypnotize people via Internet? Yes. It seems that... you're capable of thinking of something meaningful. It's not my theory. But it really happened in reality. Did it happen in reality? In a word, is this kind of hypnosis feasible? Hypnosis is to give hints to the subjects in order to awaken some of their... special experience or specific behavior. Internet is just a medium. The key is the signals of hypnosis. That means Internet hypnosis is feasible. Yes. It depends on the measures to be taken. If the means is proper, it is possible. Is there any particular means needed? What do you want? I just wonder if it requires some computer genius to create some special programs so as to work it out. Ma Ming. I'm just a professor of psychology. I don't teach computer science. I can't answer this question. All right. I still have a lesson to prepare for. I have to go. Professor. THE LONG-HAIRED WOMAN TANG JING SU XIAOJING, JIANG QIONG SHAO NA ZISHAN SHENGZHOU -Hey. -Ma Ming. I've asked the taxi you mentioned last time. The taxi driver did give a ride to a person in a wheelchair. It was uptown near Shengli Road. Okay... Thank you... INVESTIGATION REPORT Shengzhou. Real name: Dai Yuncong. 30 years old. Professional in computer. Is that all you have got? Yes. This is all the information in his file. We have to be more careful. After all, his real purpose is not yet known. Yes, sir. Ma Ming, you are really persistent. Holmes said, "when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth." So? So I've come up with another possibility. The possibility of no ghost. The murderer might slay by hypnosis through the Internet. Go back. We'll find Dai Yuncong and find out the truth. Dai Yuncong. So the real name of Shengzhou is Dai Yuncong? Is it a disabled man? In a wheelchair? And he is a computer genius, right? How do you know so much? I saw him on the spot of Shao Na's death. I found him weird. So I asked my friend in the taxi company to check him up. Welcome to my house. It's really my honor. I'm Dai Yuncong. You can also call me Shengzhou. So it's you! I just wanted to confirm whether the result of my research was used by others. You murderer! Tell me about you. Six years ago, I started Fallen Star Tower. Due to my disability, I seldom attended any social activities since I was young. Internet... is my only way of communication with others. I like writing novels online. I dwelled in all kinds of novel-related BBS. Gradually, I got to know several friends who share the same values. I think you should already figure out who they are. In the fiction... we have other identities. We got on well with each other. However... it's inevitable that we might be curious about each other. Thus... about three years later... we decided to have an offline gathering. Actually, it was not the first time. Before that... Jinghong... Liuli and Ming had met. We all know each other's real names and ages. And we shared photos too. But that day... was the first time we met face to face. Su Xiaojing and Jiang Qing, I felt they hit it off. Tang Jing and Shao Na got on well, too. Sorry I'm late. Though it seemed that we aren't meeting for the first time, nice to meet you guys. -Welcome. -Take a seat. Tang Jing. I was caught in a traffic jam. Your hair is so beautiful, straight and long. Thank you. Get a picture. Hold on. I'd like to join. Alright. Then let me take it for you. Come on. I'll take it for you. I have received your E-mail. I was so happy. But... But... Actually, I appreciate you so much. You are so talented. I'm sure there'll be a better girl who will fall in love with you. I... I really have someone on my mind. Xia Weiyi is really a smart girl. And she can understand my research very well. Therefore... we keep in touch outside the world of Fallen Star Tower. Really... Xia Weiyi is... such a superb girl. Hey. Enough! We're not here to listen to your love story. Hear him out. Go on. Nothing happened later. It's all because of the person Xia Weiyi fell for... the happy gathering was screwed up. When everyone was chitchatting happily... which was 2 hours after the party started... Tang Jing went to the restroom. Excuse me. I need to go to the restroom. Go ahead. Don't you think so? Yes. If they're the same, nothing is worthwhile writing. Totally the same, in reality and in the novel. Yeah, but I would think... a sweet girl like this... Because I always long for... It was a long time before they came back. Now the atmosphere has totally changed. What's wrong? Tang Jing, are you all right? Well, Tang Jing... Tang Jing. Where are you going, Tang Jing? What happened? What's going on? What is it, Weiyi? I have to go. It was the last time I've seen Xia Weiyi. Since then Xia Weiyi was in the hospital. In the hospital? Because the failure of love hit her so badly. She was hospitalized for depression. In the hospital... she slipped away from the nurse's monitoring... and chose to slay herself. That is to say... The man Xia Weiyi loved was exactly the same person Tang Jing was in love with. So she couldn't take the pain and committed suicide. I don't want to talk anymore. Why? So... the man both Xia Weiyi and Tang Jing love... is Zishan? I don't want to talk about it anymore. Then why did you call us here? Because Fallen Star Tower was updated again after a long disappearance. LAST CHAPTER JINGHONG SAGA Is it the web novel you mentioned? How come it is visible again? Several months ago... a man came to me... and told me that he was so interested in the AI technology I'm working on. He gave me a large sum of money for R and D... and asked me to provide him with relevant technical support. But I didn't expect that... he used my technology to eliminate people. Besides... Besides, what? Besides, I don't know that man... is Xia Weiyi's father. Xia Weiyi's father? So he used your technology... to hypnotize Tang Jing, Jiang Qiong, Su Xiaojing and Shao Na... and finally forced them to commit suicide. Is that so? Exactly. Furthermore... he not only wanted to eliminate all Fallen Star Tower members... LAST CHAPTER but also you and your friend. You need to come to the police station with us. We need a detailed statement from you. THE FINAL CHAPTER NUO & MA MING SAGA Hold on. I need to take a leak. With my physical status like this... I can't run out of here. My bathroom here is quite convenient. I'll be right back. It's really so convenient here. No! Oh shit. Show me that diagram. Call Wu. Tell him to hasten the investigation of this Zishan. Yes, sir. Investigate Xia Weiyi's father. Yes, sir. Hello? Mrs. Zhou. What? Nuo is missing. Okay. I'll be right there. Where are you going? Nuo is in danger now! Ma Ming, hurry up! -Where's Nuo? -I don't know. His father is looking for her. TANG JING SAID IF I GO MEET HER, SHE WILL TELL ME THE TRUTH. SO I AM GOING NOW. NUO. Do you have any clue? What clue do I have? Nuo's father is looking for her nearby randomly. You know what, she didn't take her phone along. Tang Jing's computer. Aunt. There could be some clues about Nuo in here. Let me stay alone in the room. Unless I do anything to hurt myself, leave me alone. Okay. LASTCHAPTER All of this is unreal. It's all an illusion. There's no such thing as ghosts. Okay. THE LAST CHAPTER NUO & MA MING SAGA Here it is. Wu. You found it? What? Young man, what are you doing there? Don't ask. Go faster. Go faster please. NANJIANG PEOPLE'S HOSPITAL Zhou Xiaonuo! Where are you? Zhou Xiaonuo! Zhou Xiaonuo! Zhou Xiaonuo! Nuo! Come to me. Zhou Xiaonuo! Nuo! Sister is here. I've been waiting so long for you. Zhou Xiaonuo! Nuo! Nuo! I'm here. Come over now. Nuo. Sister is here. Nuo. I've been waiting so long for you. Jing. It's all my fault. That evening... I should have let you come to my house. Zhou Xiaonuo. Be sober! It's all an illusion! -Zhou Xiaonuo! -What? Zhou Xiaonuo, you are hypnotized! This is an illusion! Zhou Xiaonuo! Ma Ming? Where am I? We are now in the hospital of Fallen Star Tower. Get moving! Forget it. Go! Watch out! Zishan? You are Zishan. Run with us! He is not true. Do you want to help me or not? Illusion. It's all an illusion. Hello? Hey. Listen to me. Xia Weiyi's father is Professor Tong. What? Xia Weiyi's father... is Professor Tong? Yes. And that man named Zishan in Fallen Star Tower... is exactly Xia Weiyi in disguise of Zishan. Zishan... is Xia Weiyi? -Zishan... -Ma Ming! Ma Ming! is the long-haired woman. Run! Don't look! Move! Stay away! Nuo! Nuo! Come on, Nuo! Nuo! Nuo! Nuo! It's all right. It's all over. Look! Nuo. Zhou Xiaonuo. Zhou Xiaonuo! Zhou Xiaonuo. Nuo. Zhou Xiaonuo! Ma Ming! How do you know we are in this hospital? This is... the hospital Professor Tong once worked in. Are you all right? NANJIANG UNIVERSITY The practice of... changing human's behaviors with hypnosis... could be traced back to prehistoric times. In ancient Rome... ancient India... and ancient Egypt... their sacrificial ceremony... with meditation... always worked with certain means... and intense rhythms... such as music... to bring people into hypnosis. About this... in ancient Greek literatures... and the classic of traditional Chinese medicine, the Inner Canon of Yellow Emperor, lots of records could be found. I once... worked in that hospital. When my daughter was two years old... for the sake of my future... I abandoned my wife and her... and went to the US alone. My wife... couldn't take this blow mentally... and started to have heart disease. Before long... she passed away. My daughter was brought up by her grandma... and changed to her mother's surname. Due to the lack of parental care... she became... more and more eccentric. She was always indulged... in the cyber world. Many years later... I returned home with the hard-won achievement from the USA... only to find that... she committed suicide. I heard that... she was bullied to death by the people in the web fiction... Fallen Star Tower. In this fiction... she played this male role named Zishan. Since she was so absorbed in it... she could not tell the cyber world... from reality. But actually I think your... Excuse me. I need to go to the restroom. But she really fell in love with... her love in the fiction... Tang Jing. However... after she confessed... she was disgusted and rejected by Tang Jing. And Tang Jing... Tang Jing? Where are you going, Tang Jing? What's wrong with you two? Well, I have to go first. Therefore... she let Zishan in the novel commit suicide by cutting his own neck. She also wanted to slay herself in the same way. But it didn't work out for her. She was hospitalized. What are you doing? My daughter died where I once worked. If, at that time... I hadn't abandoned my family... my daughter wouldn't have been addicted to the Internet... nor would she have had... such miserable experience. I killed my daughter. I killed my daughter. This murder with hypnosis shares a lot of similarities with the international case of Blue Whale. He used social network to set up serial murders. Thank you for making the trip especially to tell us about this. Do you feel better? My mom took me to the psychologist. Much better now. Captain Li... we owe you a lot this time. Actually, I should thank the two of you. Your persistence... and your smartness have done me a big favor. Okay. I have to go. Remember... study hard. Don't be indulged in the cyber world. Yes, sir!
