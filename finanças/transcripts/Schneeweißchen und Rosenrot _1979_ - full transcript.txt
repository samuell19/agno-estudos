Snow White, Rose Red. Good morning, Klaus. Don't come back too late. And don't go near the tunnel. And don't go near the tunnel. Why don't you let me shoot? - Strange. - Why is he running away? Is he scared of us? Hello, where are you? Answer me. Fear not, we are the King's hunters. There's nobody here. You see, princes. - A hidden passage. The wood is quite old, the door was barred years ago. It must be a disused tunnel. Is that the Amalie tunnel? People, buy herbal medicine. Fresh fish, buy, people. Never before have they been so fresh. Buy, people, buy. Apples, people, buy crisp Alpine country apples. Come, buy. 1 Kreuzer for the jumping jack who can move his arms and legs. Come, children, come and buy. Buy, people, or you'll regret it. - How much do the jumping jacks cost? - 1 kreuzer, the small one. The big one costs half a kreuzer more. I'll have to ask my mother first. I'll buy the jumping jacks. Do you want this one? Or maybe the child? Or the big one? - I'll buy them all. All, that are hanging there. He's taking all the jacks with him, too bad. So, and they are all for you. This is a rug. This covering fits on a large table. The tapestry hangs over the bed. This one is for a corner seat. Don't you like anything? You haven't looked properly. That's quite enough. Pack everything up for me. With this I'll take these two bags here. The wool is from our sheep, the buttons were carved by my sister. This is the Amalie tunnel, exactly. The forest, the rocks and everything. The car picks up the silver. The Amalie tunnel? Is the entrance boarded up now? How do you know that creepy tunnel? We discovered it whilst hunting. - Why do you call it creepy? An evil spirit haunts the place. He drove out the miners. Of all the men, only my grandfather has remained. He's not afraid of the mountain spirit. And me neither. He wants to try again with the tunnel. But he needs two courageous men without wife and child. But how should he find them? Only Snow White and Rose Red live in the valley. Tell your grandfather we would go with you. We're not afraid. And who are you? - We are hunters. My name is Michael, and that's my brother Andreas. And I am Klaus. May we visit you when we return? Our mother is always pleased to receive visitors. And we too. Don't go into the tunnels, the mountain spirit would kill you. At the next hunt we'll come. Weeks may pass before the next hunt. The old miner could get sick or lose heart. We can't wait that long. Why are you talking about grandfathers when it's about Rose Red? And you, are you only concerned about the tunnel? I want to know what's going on in the mountain. But much more I'm thinking of Snow White. I've never liked a girl so much. - Let's find an inn. When we ride home, we won't leave so fast again. Three large tablecloths, and with them small blankets. Even pillows, rugs, wall hangings, without examining a single one. And the other bought toys without rhyme nor reason? And gave them away to strangers. Those who spend money so lightly don't know hard work. Maybe they didn't buy it all for themselves. Wasting stupid money is even worse. Usually you'd be glad if we'd sold something. Usually the customers aren't men you constantly speak about. They spend their money as if... they'd just found it in the forest. And you admire them... like princes. I should have moved away with the others. At least then you would always be among people and know better how things are in the world. Snow White, I am also pleased that you've sold so much. And if winter comes early, hardly any market days will remain this year. Snow White, Rose Red. The hunters are there. Good day. Grandfather asks if he can borrow the lamp. The two men want to go with him in the tunnel. Don't give him the lamp, the mountain spirit will kill them. We'll tell them how many people were buried alive and killed. But grandfather will never again find men to go along. Grandfather Matthias stayed here because he never gave up hope. If the mountain spirit leaves people alone, we'll bring everyone back. I wish your grandfather and the two strangers all the luck. And when they are back from the tunnel, everyone should come to us. You, too, of course. The hedge is closed up again. How big is the power of the mountain spirit? It doesn't reach beyond the shadow of the mountain. That's why he never came to our village. Snow White and Rose Red's father was killed here. The mountain spirit threw that rock at him. Couldn't the rock have fallen by accident? He discovered something at the end of the tunnel. When he wanted to show it to us, the rock fell on him. We mustn't let ourselves be confused. Look out! The girls' father discovered this treasure, so he had to die. There are more treasures in this mountain than in any other mountain range. We'll bring the bravest miners from the whole land over. For you the sad times are over. What's this? I'm so hot. A hammer. As if for a child. Is he dead? He's still breathing. Down there. It's not a serious injury. Do you hear that? Strange that we only now see the spring. We only paid attention to Matthias. Maybe he'll comes to, if we put a wet cloth on his forehead? I'm thirsty. - Me too. Well, do you still want to fetch back the human rabble and steal my treasures? As bear and falcon must you live. By humans and animals hunted and shunned. One will be no more and the other can never be complete. Unless you would be loved in this form. But that will never happen. Before the moon returns three times, you will be starving. Or killed by the hunters. There. The horses, they're back. Grandpa, can you hear me? What happened? He came on one of the horses, the other ran after. Without the brothers? As I ran out, he fell down, as if dead. He's bleeding, but he's alive. He's been unable to speak. - Grandfather, wake up. Where are Andreas and Michael? I donâ€™t know. They probably brought me out of the mountain. And then? When I came to... they were no longer there. They must have failed, or be trapped somewhere, in the tunnel. We must look for them. - We'll carry him in. Mother will be right there, she can help him better. If grandfather comes to again, I'll catch you up. We'll never see them again. If they are dead, we'll leave here. Anywhere. I hate this tunnel. Mother will come with us. If they brought Grandfather out of the tunnel, they'll have escaped the mountain spirit too. Come on. Michael. Andreas. Can you hear us? Answer us. We must go to the entrance. Perhaps they can't answer. Michael. Andreas. We'll walk straight to the tunnel, don't look left or right until we're standing right in front of it. We can't get through here. Rose Red. Snow White. M and A. Michael and Andreas. The horses stood there. Maybe they've already fought here with the mountain spirit. Why didn't we see the spring before? Strange. I'm so thirsty. - Don't drink from it. There's never been a spring here. I'm so terribly thirsty. There. Did you find them? Nobody wields the sword as well as you do, Master Bertram. Bring Michael and Andreas back to me. Every enemy of your sons shall perish by this sword. You, hunter Dietmar, have the sharpest eye and the safest hand. I will save your sons, at the cost of my own life. I wish you a fine day and good hunting. We thank you for the wishes, but we are not hunting. What else should hunters of the king seek in the forest? We are looking for two young men. Something may have happened to them. Do you live nearby, grandfather? Woah. Two handsome gentlemen on proud horses. One blond with bright eyes, the other dark. Matthes or Melchior he called himself, the blond. Albrecht, no. Almeric or Adalbert... Were they called Michael and Andreas? You've got it, Mr. huntsman. Michael and Andreas, yes. were the two brothers, who asked me for the shortest way out of this forest. They wanted to ride south before winter. Do you understand? Why did they tell you that? Because I saved then from death. They had been wandering in the forest for three days and nights and completely lost their way. And when did you meet them? The moon has now changed once. You won't catch up with them anymore. Not far from here, a big bear is up to mischief. A falcon always flies near it. The fur of the bear and the feathers of the falcon you should bring to your king. That was a good throw. It was careless. - As if it were not afraid. Shoot, Dietmar. Will we try again? Before the first snow falls. Now we don't know anything anymore. We'll go with grandfather tomorrow. That can only be grandfather. - So close to the tunnel? Grandpa Matthias? Where are you? Something must have happened. A good evening to you, girls. Good evening. - Good evening. Which wind has blown you here? Or are you collecting the last mushrooms? What has happened? It happened like this... I wanted to chop some firewood, but... No. Let it be, child. I'll do it alone. Go home before it gets dark. It's not nice here. Oh, we'll hurry along then. Be careful. Nothing else will do. What are you doing? You uncouth riff-raff. How dare you cut off my majestic beard? To the devil with you! What are you staring at now? Go to hell! Come Snow White, we have to fill the other manger. We haven't been to the tunnel for a long time. You know what we promised mother. It's starting to get dark. Snow White, there were riders here. The tracks are still fresh. They're coming back. Greetings, girls. Be careful, there's a big bear running around here. We are on his trail. Are you alright? Maybe it can't fly anymore. The hunters shot him. Poor falcon. We'll nurse him. He's been hit. Now he won't escape us anymore. Next year we'll look for somewhere inhabited. Nowhere is it as beautiful as in the forest and on the lake. Here we have our home. A house cannot replace a human being. Now, if you were to marry a peasant's son or a craftsman from the city. And if a king's son came, I wouldn't take him. We want two brothers, or we won't marry at all. Your heads are still filled with those hunters. They've forgotten all about you. You always said we should never part. We can only stay together if we marry two brothers, who understand each other as well as we do. You've always liked it here, too. Naturally. But it's not about me. I could stay here with grandfather. But you shouldn't spend your whole life here in this wasteland. What sad eyes he has. I've never seen one like you before. Come in by the stove. And warm yourself. You're pleased, that you've got company from out of the forest. You know each other perhaps. He's hurt. That looks bad. We'll make a herbal bandage, then it will soon heal. You can stay with us until spring. And you stay too? The first fine spring day. Will you take a walk with us? You sneaky, creeping monster. Didn't I punish you enough? You and your brother. I own all the treasures in this mountain. All by myself. Whoever takes hold of it dies. You won't live much longer, you and all who help you. Disappear from my mountains and from this forest. Damn bird. Oh no! Help! It could be a man. But also a bird. Our falcon. Wait, we'll help you. Help. Help, I'm drowning. Do you want me to drown? Have mercy. Don't be afraid. It's not that deep here. Am I a fish that you want to drag me off in a net? Here is your boat. I can't get in. My beard is still stuck in the net. How did you fall into the water? I wanted to catch a fish. People like us also need something nutritious in the pan. The net belongs to grandfather. - What. A fish pulled me out of the boat. To the net here. And then there was this falcon. The falcon? What does our falcon have to do with your fish? Why did he scream? Falcon or fish, I'm completely confused. This murderously cold water is killing me. If I don't get ashore soon and put on some dry clothes, I'll die. I can't help you otherwise. Hurry, hurry. What are you going to do? There. Are you the devil? To desecrate my face like this. You've cut off the best part of my beard. Take care, you good-for-nothings. He had a beard like the charcoal burner and behaved that way too. But otherwise he looked different. We've never seen the charcoal burner nor the fisherman before. Now I will wring your neck. Those silly geese will have to help me. Snow White. Rose Red. It's that bearded old man again. Come. How does he know our name? Do you live at the edge of the forest with your mother? Yes. Then the message is for you. Lucky for me, meeting you here. I was on my way... I was on my way to you when a wolf attacked me in the forest. Just look what he's done to me. I'm about to plunge into the raging waters. Or be hung by my own beard. Help me... before it's too late. He's lying, no wolves have been seen in the forest for years. But if he falls? We have to help him. He's insulted us twice for our help. Help me, dear girls, and I will reward you richly. We don't want paying. I wanted to bring you a message from two unfortunates, who will never see the sunlight again. For that I was pushed into this gorge. By the mighty mountain spirit who holds them captive. Who sent you to us? Oh, go on. Asking questions doesn't help. If you don't want to do the slightest service to an old man, you don't want to free two poor prisoners. From a dungeon, seven times seven fathoms deep underground. Who are you talking about? They are hunters like me. Will you help me now? First tell us their names and where to find the dungeon. A few steps behind the tunnel you will find a dark forest on the edge of a meadow. Look there in front of three big, glowing stones, by a bush that bears black fruit. In its shadow you'll find the entrance to the dungeon. Tell us their names. Michael and Andreas. But don't speak a word to any living soul, neither human nor animal, not a word. Don't help him. Rose Red, he's lying. These hands should wither you, you thrice stupid baby-faces. Let the devil take you for robbing me of my beard. You shouldn't have helped him. Not at all. Now he can't make himself invisible anymore. What does he have to do with Andreas and Michael? - We must find out. The three shining stones. And a shrub with black fruit. Why have we never noticed the stones and the shrub before? There has to be a way out. I wonder if behind it is the way to the dungeon? There's another door. The home of the mountain spirit. This bag belongs to Andreas. Now I have you, you silly gooses. Have you said farewell to the sunlight? You will never see it again. Stop. Look how you're shaking. You can't help yourself. And your friend, the bear, cannot help you now either. You are in my castle. I have driven away all human riff-raff. You are the mountain spirit? - A dwarf? I am a giant... of wealth and power. I am the master of the mountain. Rose Red. Now you are all in my power. Wither you will. Turn to dust. No human being will ever again reach out their hand for the treasures of my mountain. You wanted to free the two prisoners? Where do you think they are? There they are. The bear is Michael. And the falcon, his brother Andreas. Stop, you monster. Leave the stick alone. No. Are you really Andreas? The mountain spirit has turned you into animals, but you feel as if you're human. Come home. You shall stay with us forever. We will never let you down. There, it looks like a way out. Quick, before the grotto floods. We'll have to go through. Where are we? Is it perhaps... Yes, the Amalie tunnel. Not a drop of water comes from the stone. Probably the mountain spirit caused the spring to flow. Your friendship and courage were stronger than the malice and greed of the mountain spirit. We are the sons of a king. Our father's castle stands on the other side of the mountains. Will you go with us? Subtitles: corvusalbus
