Aha! Look at that. Come on now. What do you think? Yeah, yeah. Nice shot or what? I'm gonna go with hot pink this week, oh can you paint those little Shasta daisies on there. Oh yeah. It is summer after all. That was awesome. This is what I'm doing all summer. Did you girls see what she was wearing to Ben's party? I don't even get why he likes her. Yeah! Well, maybe we should bring her shopping with us next time. She could obviously use the help. Yeah, but shopping is not gonna help her face. You're getting pretty psycho on that bike. You guys only wish you were as good. I'll be sponsored while you're working fast food. Hey, you guys are done today. Pack it up. Come in we're setting it up out back. Nice, check it out. Cute I know. Who was that? A friend. A guy? Yeah, so? So we've talked about this. You're too young to date and you're way too young to have a boyfriend. I can't have a friend who's a guy? He looked like more than a friend to me. Megan, you're too young. I'm not playing with you. Whatever. Here Mom, these are for you. Where did you pick this? You better not be ruining my flower beds. Oh, Cameron, there are bugs on them. Take them back outside please? They're for your party. Take them outside and then get downstairs. I need you to stay down there until the party is over. Now go. Wooh! Where are you going? Out. No, I need you to watch Cameron during the party. No. You and dad are here. Besides he's by himself all the time. Hey. It's about time, the party starts in less than an hour. I got here as soon as I could. Here is your ice. I don't want it. Take it outside. Oh here, here! Go light the candles? No, not that one. You'll ruin it. It's a decoration. I never light it. I meant the ones outside. Oh, put that out on the garage. And I need you back tomorrow to clean up. I appreciate you guys working so hard on that. I saw you guys. Love your bracelet. It is beautiful. Thank you. I got them in Bermuda. Where are you going on your next vacation? I don't know. You know we've been anywhere, worth seeing... We have a timeshare that we plan to visit before the kids go back to school. You're taking the kids with you? Sure. Yeah. We never take the kids. Too much hassle. Catered, nice. Aren't you gonna impress us with your own cooking, Tara? Oh, I would if I could. I don't know how to cook. I never learned. Cameron you need to go back inside. Go back inside. I'm hungry. Oh, I forgot to order the pizza. Tara. Matt, would you go and order some pizza? You guys excuse me. Come on buddy let's get you something to eat. Hey, Josh. What do you need? I've been trying to call you all day. Yeah, I got your calls. It's really not a good time. I got people here. Do you know that your company is preparing for layoffs? Have you heard anything? No, I haven't heard anything but I'm the vice president of marketing. I think if there were something going on I would know. Just keep an eye out. If there's anything you need or something I can do, call me. Alright, alright, I'll do it. I gotta go. Read this when you got a minute. Alright, I'll do it. I'll see you later. What took you so long? They had me on hold. Hey, I ate your salmon. I hope you don't mind. Yeah, I can see that. Thanks, Brad. No problem. It's intention was to escape to land but I leaped into the water and waited oh. Dad! How did it go? What did he say? He didn't wanna talk. Well, he's just too proud. All we could do is pray for him. Let's pray. Father in Heaven, hollowed be thy name, our prayers for Matt and his family. Please bless Matt that his heart may be softened, that he may become a strong, spiritual leader in his home, and that he'll accept the love and support of his family. He seems to be asking to pray for, in the name of thy son, Jesus Christ, Amen. Oh, Matt, we forgot about Cameron. Would you go check on him? Brendan, where have you been? You should have seen me. I was catching some serious air. Is that what you did all day? What about your college application? Did you get around the filling that out today? Brendan, we were gonna watch a movie together? Oh, I know. I'm sorry, buddy. Next time, okay? You clean yourself and go to bed. Who ate all the cereal? I hid that for me. You can't have all that. Give me some. No way. You always get all the food! You gotta be fast. You two sound like five-year-olds. Where are you going, mom? Mom? I've gotta go to the store and then I have a hair appointment. What kind of a store? Can I come with you? You can go with Brendan. I can't take him. The guys will be here any minute. Oh, Megan, I guess you're playing with Cameron today. Don't even ask. I have plans. Oh, and I need to use one of your credit cards. Nobody ever takes me. I'll take you when I go hiking, buddy. Where's dad? It's Saturday. He left before I got up but I'm pretty sure he went golfing. Can I play with Jacob? No, no one can take you. I wish I had someone to play with. Can we have another baby? What? What did you say? Mom cannot have another baby. She's way too old. I am not that old but it would take a miracle. Well, I believe in miracles, don't you? Look, why don't you go and play in your room for a little while, okay? Or you could play a video game or watch a movie. I'm out of here. Brendan has a new one he hasn't even seen yet. Can't you put that on a dishwasher? and put the maid out of a job? Oh, that's right. The maid is coming today. Cameron, can you let her in when she gets here? Sure Mom. Thank you. See you later. Bye. Guys are here, see you later buddy. Bye. Do you have any kids? I have a son about your age. Can he come play the next time you come over? Maybe. Are you home alone again, Cameron? Yeah. Hello? Hey, buddy. Where is everybody? I don't know. You're all by yourself? Yeah. You hungry? Yes. Good. More for me and you. So what did you do today? I built a really cool model today. Matt Webster. Yeah, thanks for calling me back. Listen, I don't know if I'm gonna have that project done in the morning. I would apply if I had any available credit. You guys have turned me down for loan modification and refinance. No. Catching up on the payments is not an option. I keep telling you, I can't sell. The market shifted. I owe more on the house than it's worth. What other options are there? Foreclosure? There's gotta be another way. I have to call you back. The HR guy is here from Corporate. I just saw him down the hall. What's he doing here? It can't be good. You know what, he's probably here doing an insurance enrollment. Maybe. Randy, relax. We're getting bonuses, right? We're obviously doing a good job. We're indispensable. Brad and I are going to lunch. Do you wanna join us? I can't. I gotta run an errand. Alright. Dad? Yeah, buddy? Are we going to go to church this week? We didn't go last week. We didn't? Yeah, we'll go. You get dressed. We'll go to church this week. Good night, dad. Good night, Cameron. What's all this? Just some stuff for the house. How much did you spend this time? I don't know. Tara, we need to cut back. It's not like we can't afford it. I'm just saying we need to be a little more careful for a while, that's all. Since when? Since things are getting a little tight. I can barely keep up with the minimum payments. Tara, are you even listening to me? You need to cut back. Me? What about you? You spend just as much as I do. Well, we all need to cut back. You know what, we're gonna have a family meeting tomorrow. Can you please make sure everybody's here when I get home from work? Tara, I'm serious. No, I can't do it this time. You can't or you won't? Both. Mom, my house is going into foreclosure. Son, I can't keep bailing you out. But mom, it's not my fault. It's the economy. Everybody's hurting right now. Not everybody. Right, Josh. He's perfect. Everybody can't be Josh, mom. Josh lives by true principles. Besides, you have not changed the way you're living ever since I bailed you out. Matt, I love you too much to keep enabling you. How does not helping me show me love? I didn't say I wouldn't help you, just not the way you're asking me to. You need to ask God's guidance for your family. What I need is money. I'm sorry, son. You're on your own this time. Catering? Lights? DJ? Tara, this is what I'm talking about. What is all this? That's for my 16th birthday. We're gonna have to scale it back or call it off. No, dad! You're ruining my life. Megan, I'm sorry, but we have to cut back on unnecessary expenses. My birthday's unnecessary? It's not just you. We all have to cut back. We have to stop spending so much money. Not now, Josh? Matt Webster. Matt, mom just called. She's concerned. She wanted me to call and offer some financial advice. Josh, you don't know when to quit. I don't need any help from you. If wanted financial advice, I'd pay you for it. Now, leave me alone. You have got to see this. Come outside. Not right now, Brad. I'm busy. It's awesome. You gotta see what we did at lunch. Come on. What's going on? You're not yourself lately. I've got a lot of work to do, busy. I don't have time to be out. You will forget all about that when you see this. What is it? Check it out. Come on. This is yours? Yeah, it's mine. You bought this? It's what I said. Just picked it up. What about the layoff rumors? You're not worried about that? No. I decided to buy it now though just in case. Without a job, I couldn't get a loan it. So you bought a car knowing you may not be able to afford it? Sure, but all will last, right? This is a nice chunk of change. What about your kids' college education? I don't have kids. Yeah, you do, Brad. They're not my kids. They're my wife's. Her ex can deal with that. Obviously, nothing's changed around here. Cameron, where's everybody? I don't know. Have you eaten anything? No. Come on, let's make a sandwich. So you haven't seen Megan or Brendan? You should have seen me, I got a 40-minute flight. It was so awesome. Brendan, are you gonna play all your life? When are you gonna get a job? Dad, I can help make a sandwich. And Megan, where have you been? Spending every dime we have? You're as bad as your mother. What's with you? You know what? What's with all of you? You don't seem to care about anything but yourselves. Dad, what's wrong? All of you just go to your room. Enjoy it. You may not have one next week. I said go! I can help you put your financial house in order according to biblical principles. Read Romans 13:8 and Proverbs 21:20. Josh. Okay, Josh wise man. Owe no man anything but to love one another for he that loveth blah blah blah blah blah. There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man. Great, now I'm a fool. Thanks, Josh. I don't wanna go home. Summer's way too long and my kids are driving me crazy. Tell me about it, I cannot for mine to go back to school. Yeah. I'm feeling bad for Cameron. He has no one to play with. Seriously? Can't you just get him a nanny? Excuse me. Your credit card was declined. It shouldn't be. Maybe the strips worn off off. Hold on. Try this one. So when do your kids start school again. Oh. This one is declined too. That's weird. Okay, I know this one is alright. Declined. Do you have another form of payment? Here, I've got it. What is going on? I've been waiting to ask you the same question. You just can't wait to go out and spend every chance you get. Oh, don't worry, I couldn't spend a thing. What do you mean couldn't? Declined. Do you have any idea how humiliating it is to get declined, especially in front of my friends? And not just this card, three cards. Everyone in the restaurant was staring at me. What is going on? And what is so funny? Well, Tara, obviously, we're over the limit. What are you doing? I told you we had to stop spending. No, you said we had to cut back. No, I said we had to stop spending. When were you gotta tell me about the house? When we're out of the street? What difference does it make? There's nothing you can do about it. No definitely not now, but I live here too, I deserve to know about this. Well now you know. When did we get so far behind on the house? The mortgage adjusted 6 months ago. We're making twice the payment. I don't make that much money Tara. We're just not making it. Well, can we borrow against the house or refinance? Don't you get it? That's how we got in this mess to begin with. We keep borrowing against the house to pay off the credit cards. As soon as they're paid off, they get run right back up again. We don't have any money, we don't have any credit. And our house is being foreclosed on. Dad. What Cameron? Lets go to church. Can't really, Cameron. I'm too tired. You said you would take me. I know buddy. I had to work late last night though. Tara, why don't you take him? I'm not going if you're not. Cameron, I'll take you next week, alright? Just go on and get some breakfast. Hey Matt, I know, I don't know when to quit but I was thinking about you and felt prompted to call. I just wanted to encourage you to read Luke 12, today. Call me if you need anything, okay, that's all. Read Luke 12. What are you doing dad? I'm taking some pictures of some of our stuff. I have to put some ads on the internet. Could I help? Yeah, you know what? Go tell everybody there's gonna be another family meeting, alright? Okay. Look, we're not getting anywhere with our debt. We still owe too much. On what? On everything Tara, between the house, the boat, the RV, the dirt bikes, we're paying thousands of dollars a month and we don't have it. So you're saying we're selling our stuff? Technically it's not our stuff. We don't own any of it. We Owen a bunch of payments. My dirt bikes? They gotta go. You can't sell those, I use those. You didn't pay for them Brendan. When you can afford your own, you're welcome to have one. What about the house? I'm trying to sell it. I'm also waiting on a bonus from work. If I can get it by next week, we might be able to keep out of foreclosure. We're losing the house? As of now. Look, everyone's gonna have to start and take an initiative here, and Brendan quit doodling in that sketch book, you need to get a job! Dad, don't you think we should pray to see what God wants us to do? Tara, I need to talk to you. The landscaper quit, my last my last check to him bounced. And I had to let the maid go. You did what? Come on Tara, we can barely afford to eat. Some things have to change around here. You know we can afford a maid. So, who's gonna clean up around here? Oh, you know I can't. You know she can't. The two of you have to figure it out together. Oh. Dad! Yes Megan? My phone is broken. It's not broken, Megan. We only need my phone for work, yours is expendable. Expendable? Thanks for ruining my life. Josh, what do you want? Are you ready to talk yet? Matt, I'm a financial adviser. Don't you think I can help my brother? What do you know? I know you're in trouble. I love you, I just wanna help. You know what? You think you're so much better than me. You just can't wait to rub it in. I don't butt into your life, I don't tell you how to live or what to do. All I ever get from you is judgment. Judgment? What? and your self-righteous life, I'm over it. Matt, I'm only here because I care about you. I wish you could see that. Look, when you're ready talk, I'll be here, that's what brothers do. Josh, if I want your help, I'll ask for it. Excuse me, what you are doing? We're repossessing your vehicle ma'am. What for? Well, it says here, due to non payment. You can't have it. Jim, what about the bonuses? About my bonus? As a CEO I'm not even planning on one. The economy has hit us hard and unexpectedly. Our biggest deals are backing out. Jim, you don't understand, I need this bonus. Besides I thought they were based on last quarter's performance. What would have been bonuses are now what we're operating on. Listen Matt, I came here to talk to you about tightening up the marketing department. Tightening up? On what? Jobs? Expenses? We're on a hiring freeze. Nobody gets promoted, nobody's getting a raise, nobody is getting a bonus. Look, you're lucky it's not any worse. The sales department is being restructured. Well, it's done. No bonus. Matt Webster? Yeah? I'm a representative from your mortgage holder. I've been authorized to give you cash for keys. It's a relocation program. So what, you're offering money to leave my house? Technically, it's not your house. It's been foreclosed on, so if you leave the property in its current condition and be out within 10 days, the bank will provide you with a check. You have 24 hours to decide. You know what? Do you have a pen? Sure. Hey Josh, it's Matt. Yeah, look, this isn't easy for me. I don't know what else to do. I keep it hidden from my friends. Hey everybody! Uncle Matt and his family are gonna stay with us for a while. They'll be here this weekend. Yes! Yeah! Can Cameron stay in my room? He sure can. Josh, can I talk to you for a minute? Sarah, keep reading this. I'll be right back. Does Tara know about this? I guess so. Matt's calling about it. Why? Josh, you know she doesn't like me. I just don't see this going over very well. They don't have anywhere else to go. Mom's condo is too small. I know. I don't have a problem with it. It's just it's going to be hard, really hard. We have the room. It's not what I mean. What's wrong? I just didn't know it would be so hard. I don't wanna leave. I know. I mean, I know we have to but it's just hard. Who would have thought when we moved in here it would be like this? We had everything ahead of us. But you know what, Tara, we still do. I'm kind of excited to see what the future holds. I don't know how you can be so positive. I'm just trying to have faith, I guess. You need to read Luke 12. It really helped. But we're losing our house. Look at it this way. Adam and Eve suffered the ultimate eviction. We're just losing our house. Just losing our house? I know it sounds crazy. I'm just finally starting to realize we don't own any of this. It all belongs to God. Well, I don't know what to say. I really we really appreciate all of your help. I don't know what we would have done if you guys hadn't come today. Thank you. I can't even count how many times I have chased Cameron through this kitchen. I can count we had dinner together. Cameron, that's not funny. Megan thought so. Alright guys, time to go. Come on Mom. Look, Josh says they have plenty of room. It's gonna be fine. I feel weird about this. Tara, it's only temporary. Hey, Josh. Come on in. Hey! Hi guys! Welcome. Hi, Sarah. Good to see you all. They're ready for bed. Oh, we're gonna have a lot of fun. So much fun... I'll tell you guys real quick where you're staying and then you can both go bring your things in, okay? It sounds great. Okay. Matt and Tara, we've got you downstairs in the guest room. Megan, we've got you set up on the sofa in the basement living room. Brendan, we've got you set up in the private playhouse suite out back. And Cameron, you get to stay with Jacob in his room. Yey! A playhouse? Oh yeah, it's great. There's electricity out there and you've got all to yourself. You only need to come in for the bathroom. Thanks. He'll love it. You guys make yourselves at home. There's towels in the closet, food in the fridge, and you're welcome to join us for any activities that we're doing, okay? We will. Thank you guys for everything. We really do appreciate this. It's been a long day though. I think we're gonna go and hit the bed. Alright? We're about to have family prayer, would you like to join us? >> Oh, no, that's okay. We'll just see you in the morning. Alright, guys, good night. Thank you again. See you in the morning. Jacob, please show Brendan where he'll be staying. You're so lucky Brendan. I never get to stay out in the playhouse. I don't know if I can take it. I have no privacy and Rachel is way too nice. She bugs me. Why don't you go take a shower and wind down. Rachel said the towels are in the hall. Mom, dad, come check this out. What's with the grocery store in their basement? Megan get out of there. You can ask them about it tomorrow. I don't wanna ask them. They think I'm snooping. You ask. You are snooping. What am I gonna do here all day tomorrow? I going to be totally bored. You see how many kids are here, the last thing you'll be is bored. Tortured maybe, but not bored. Hey. Do you want a pancake? >> Breakfast? Yeah, do you want one? I have two ready for you right here. Thanks. You can eat it. We already had the prayer. What time did you all get up? 6:30. What have you been doing since 6:30? The usual; prayer, scriptures, chores, and now breakfast. But it's barely 9. Yeah, we slept in a little today. We usually get up at 6 o'clock so we're all done with breakfast by 8:30. Where is my mom? I haven't seen her up yet. What about Brendan? He should be probably playing out in the playhouse. He's so lucky. What? Are you here for tea party? What are you doing today? I've gotta get out of here. Gavin is picking me up in his two-seat truck. There's no room for you. Ride in the back? Nope. Have fun. Jacob, Sarah, dinner duty. What's my job. Setting and clearing the table. Jacob, it is your night to help me fix dinner. Could I help? Sure. Go wash your hands and I'll get you started on chopping the vegetables for the salad. That's my spot. I can't do it. I feel so out of place. Tell me about it. Move. Amen. Cameron, did you tell your parents we're ready to eat? Yeah, I told them. I don't know what's taking them so long. I'm gonna grab a plate for Megan and Tara, they're not feeling well. It looks great. There you go. Thanks. Maybe tomorrow. Here. Eat it. I can't live like this. I feel totally trapped. You're not the only one. Brendan! Has anyone seen Brendan? He left early. Here, can you hold her for a minute while I get something? Come on. Tara. What do you say we clean up this mess? I know this has to be hard for you to come stay here with us but I really think you'll feel better if you had something to do. I'm doing something. I can see that. What we need to do though is straighten this mess. It's depressing isn't it? I'll take these plates up. Could you finish picking up the trash? There. I think this area is clear enough to vacuum. I'll go plug it in for you. Thanks. You can put it in the garage. It would be great if we could eat as a family tonight. I have some errands to run with Matt gets home with the car. Oh, Okay. Matt, we need to talk. Not now Tara. I wanna go back. Go back where? We have no place to go. And you know we can't afford anything else right now. Then get a higher paying job. You have to do something. Oh, I can't live like this anymore. Come on, Tara, you've gonna figure out a way to make this work. It's not gonna kill you to help out. You think you have it bad? I'm staying in a playhouse. I'm so embarrassed to be here. My friends will even drive by here to pick me up. Do you hear this Matt? We hate it here. Do you know what I hear? Ungrateful spoiled brats. Don't you guys get it? Our lives have changed. This is where we live, this is how we live. I don't wanna hear anymore complaining. You think you hated here? Trust me you'd hate the alternative a lot more. I don't think any of you are cut out to live in a cardboard box. I can't do this. It's too hard. Megan, I would prefer that you and your mom ate at the table. Letting you eat downstairs is setting a bad example since our house rule is if you're healthy and able, you eat at the table. Where is breakfast? Rachel wants us to eat at the table. What? Oh, of course, we've just been waiting for her to do this. She wasn't rude about it. Oh! She's never rude. She's just I'm so sick of it here. Me too. Cameron is having a good time enough. She just thinks she's so perfect with her chickens and her garden and her grocery store in the basement. As for my chickens, my garden, and my grocery store? How do you think I'm feeding all of you? My grocery store, as you call it, is stores that will feed us in case of an emergency. We're glad to help you because we have food to share. That's not what I meant, I was just I know. You are used to something else at your house. And I'm sorry, you don't have one anymore. I am happy to have you here. I could just use a little more help. I'll put this away. Thank you. Dinner is at 6 and I need your help to fix it at 4:30. Alright. Father in heaven. Please help me to have patience and love and show kindness. And please help me to know how I can help Tara. In Jesus name, amen. Hey, can you help me peel these? We added your names to the Webster family job chart today so tomorrow, your family will have job assignments just like our family. Hey, after breakfast we'll finish our history project, Okay? Yey! Do your kids get excited over a history project? Aren't you afraid all this home schooling is making them a little socially backward? Excuse me? Well, I mean they spend all day with you, you teach them, I just thought maybe Tara, are you insinuating that I'm socially backwards? No. Never mind. What are my jobs? You have dishes, which is unloading and loading all day, vacuuming the upstairs and the basement area and garden duty. What's garden duty? Watering the garden, pulling the weeds, picking the ripe vegetables. And how do I know when the vegetables are ripe? I'll send Sarah out to help you. And Megan you have the bathrooms and taking out the garbage okay. I can do that. Do you think if Megan and I finish it quickly we could borrow the car to run an errand? I think that would be fine. I'll ask Josh if he needs his car. We need to keep ours here in case I need to leave with the kids. Okay great. And what about Brendan, what's he doing? He'll be mowing the lawn. Oh, don't pull that one, that's a squash. Sorry. Here pull the ones that looks like this. What happened? I don't know something touched me a bug or a spider, something. This? Oh. This is a rolly roly-poly bug. It won't hurt you, look he plays dead. Oh, so it's nice. Yeah. It's cute too don't you think? Sure. Here, Mom wants the cucumber before we go inside. You can bring one in. We are done weeding. That's a zucchini, here take one of these. It's Tara. Hey. No, I'm not on vacation. No I'm sure I told you where I was, didn't I? Oh no well, anyway no I just I've been dying to get out and I just wondered if maybe you wanted to join Megan and me for a girls day out today. Oh why not. Are you gonna be with your in-laws all day? So there's no way you can go? Oh, okay, no, we'll we'll miss you. Oh yeah definitely, yeah we'll, no we'll try it another time, okay, okay, alright, bye-bye. There's about 300 dollars worth in this pile. Yep that’s about my pile too. So after we return these can we spend any of it? Maybe a little, but I think dad will be impressed if we gave him a bunch of cash. I do you think we can afford a quick pedicure though. Yes. Cameron. What? Come here. I'm going rock climbing with the guys today. You remember when I said I'd take you next time? Yeah. Well, do you wanna go? Really? Yeah, the guys will be here in a few minutes, can you be ready? Sure. Can Jacob go? I don't think there's gonna be enough room this time with all the guys and gear. How about taking Jacob next time? Okay. Alright, I'm gonna go get the stuff. I just saw the HR guy here again. Randy, relax, it's the sales department. It's getting restructured. So he is here to do layoffs. For the sales department. Well, we're safe, right? Yeah, as far as I know. We should eat there after, do you want to? Okay, yeah, sounds good. What? Mom, what is going on? Why are we leaving? We have an appointment. Let's climb here. It's been a while since we've taken this route. I've never soloed it. Dude, that's tough. It's pretty gnarly at the end. You don't have any overhang? You took a couple of falls on it before. Yeah but, that was when I was first figuring it out. Now it's like a puzzle I've done a million times. I know just how to do it. Just climb with Trad, Brendan. I brought my canopy. Nah, I know I can do it. Matt Webster. Sure, when do you want to do that? Yeah, I can come right now. Okay, bye. Watch this Cameron. Push it on the over hang. Come on Brendan, you can make it. Get up there. Hey. That was awesome. You guys thought I couldn't make it. Cameron, did you see that? Cameron? Yeah, thanks for coming in. Yeah. I hate to be the bearer of bad news but you know there's been cut backs and it's affecting your department. Cameron, hold still. Cameron. Don't move. You guys try and get up. I'm gonna try and get down. Help! Brendan. Aaahh! Cameron! Matt, Brendan just called. Cameron was in an accident. >> What? They're at the hospital. Where is Tara? She's not here. I'll bring her when she gets back. Tell her I'll meet her at the hospital. Brendan, what happened? It's all my fault. What happened? I took him rock climbing, I wasn't watching him, I didn't know he would climb up the rope, he fell. Come here. Dad? Can we pray? Yeah, I think we should. Lord I know I don't deserve your help. Please, don't take my child Lord. We're losing everything, please don't take my child. Please, I'll do what ever I have to. Please don't take him away. In Jesus name. Tara, Cameron is in the hospital. Wha-what? Josh call your mom, we're on our way. What hap what happened? He's been hurt. I'll tell you on the way, I'll drive. Any news? Not yet. He's still in surgery. Brendan and I have been praying. I have been too. I think he's gonna be okay. How do you know? Just trying to have faith. When can we see him? We don't know. He is still in surgery, it could be hours. Are you the parents of Cameron Webster? Yes. We were able to mend and repair Cameron pretty well. He's stable right now and I think he's going to be okay. When can we see him? He is sedated right now. The best thing you can do is to go home and get some sleep. He'll be groggy in the morning but should be ready to accept visitors. Thank you Lord for saving my son. Did you realize what a good kid he is? He's always been so good, he's easy to forget. He's just never asked for much. He's always entertaining himself and never was any trouble. Realizing that I don't know any of 'em. They're growing up so fast. Soon they're gone and I've missed it. It's like I went to sleep. I don't know when it happened. I guess this is my wake up call. You know why I wasn't home today, shopping. Megan and I hit a sale while my son could have died. Just makes me sad to think of how much of my life was spent doing unimportant things. I guess we both got regrets. I know we've been doing this wrong, but I gotta believe we can do it better. I feel like we're getting a second chance here, Tara. I don't wanna blow it. Yesterday I was worried about where we're gonna live but I am just grateful to be alive. Family is everything. We gotta start putting it first. Look at this. I found it when I was going through some things with Cameron. Who's is this? Brendan's. I didn't know he could draw like this. Me neither. It's incredible. Buddy, you're awake? Cameron. I've never been so happy to see you. We bought you some things honey. Let's put 'em right here, alright? Thanks Mom. Hey buddy listen the doctors say you need to get your rest okay, so we're not gonna stay. We'll be back later though. Alright, get some sleep. Glad you're feeling better. I'm so sorry Cameron, can you forgive me? We love you buddy. It wasn't your fault. It was pretty dumb of me. Brendan, you're being too hard on yourself. I knew better. I'm so stupid. I wasn't tied in dad. I soloed it and showed Cameron by my bad example that it was okay to climb without a rope. He didn't know any better. You made a mistake. It's ironic, you don't know how well you just summed up my life. What? Brendan, you were trying to look good for your friends. Try to impress them. That's what I was trying to do. You pushed yourself, ignored all the risks, all for your own glory. That's what I did too. The only difference is when I fell I took all of us with me. Do you realize we lost everything because of my pride? So what now? We tie in and climb again. This time though we can trust in our own ability and we can't do it for our glory. This time we gotta do it for God's glory. Brendan, the mistake we made was, we thought we could do for ourselves what we can only do through the Lord. Does that make sense? It's gonna be okay. Cameron's strong, he's gonna pull out in this, I love you. And you know what? I saw your sketch book, I hope that's all right. Brendan, I really liked it. You have some amazing talent. I'm sorry I didn't see it sooner. Matt, what's going on? Well, with all that's been happening, I haven't had a chance to give you the bad news. About Cameron? No, not about Cameron. But I did lose my job. I got laid off yesterday. Look, Tara, I know what you're thinking but I feel blessed, we have place to live. I don't know what I would've done if I had to lost my job and the house at the same time. Does this mean that we have to stay here even longer? Not necessarily. Josh has some ideas on how to get me back on my feet financially. I just didn't want you to stress about it. Well, I don't know what else could upset me now. So you won't mind that I'm selling the Audi? Oh, Matt. Don't worry, we're gonna get another car soon. This time it's gonna be cash. Come in. Okay little brother, I'm ready to learn. About time. I've been watching you. You're so patient with the kids. I don't know how you do it. Patience takes practice and I get plenty of it. I also read Proverbs 31 all the time for help. Proverbs 31. It's where God describes what a virtuous woman is. Oh yeah. I remember that chapter. You know Rachel, watching you has made me remember why I wanted kids. Cameron was just such a surprise. He's just I've just been in shock or I think maybe even denial ever since. Just wasn't prepared for any of it. But I wanna live Proverbs 31. You will. I also like the scripture, "children are inherited to the Lord" Psalms 3Ì 7:3. I need that daily reminder. I love that, I need to live that. I'm sorry. I I'm sorry. I've been so horrible to you. It's okay, I loved you anyway. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father which is in heaven. I don't know Josh. You're saying I gotta use savings for everything that my check doesn't cover? Yes. Without savings you can never get ahead, and you only get deeper in debt. It's a vicious cycle. And you're serious? Your house is paid for? Yes. And you can do it too. It only takes discipline and a plan, small amounts add up fast. Mom, these are for you. Oh, Elijah, these are beautiful. Thank you, buddy. Mwah. I'm gonna put this on a special place so everyone can see 'em. Thanks, buddy. I know I need to start saving but I don't know how to do it right now, especially now. I'm doing everything I can. I got my resume out there, but nobody's hiring. What do you selling today? Oh, look at the lizards we made dad. They're only a dollar. You want one? No. I want all seven. All seven? Yeah, have you thought of marketing as an independent? Okay, that would be 7 dollars please. Thank you. I have enough money to go to the pool. You mean go into business for myself? I wouldn't even know where to start. Business is providing something other's want in exchange for money or barter. That's it. You can do that. Nothing is that simple Josh. Sure it is. It's so simple the kids could do it. Sarah has more cash at her disposal then I do most of the time. Yeah, but where I'm gonna find business? Business is everywhere. Individuals, mom and pop shops, nonprofits, Fortune 500 companies, they all need marketing. They all need your services. I can't think of anybody who needs my services right now. You know what? I can. Come on, I want to introduce you to your first client. Andrew, you got a minute? Yeah, sure. I wanted to introduce you to my brother. Andrew, this is Matt. I like your bumper sticker. Yeah, I'm somewhat of a collector. So what's up? Matt is in marketing. I thought he could help your business. Really? Well, that's great. But I don't know that I can afford any marketing yet. Well, what if we work out a deal similar to what you and I did and barter your services for now. Sounds good. What do you got in mind? Matt is gonna be buying a cheap car with cash. It's gonna need some work. You get his car running. He'll get your business running. Alrighty. It's a deal. Let's do it. Really? Yeah. Absolutely. Can I ask you a few questions? Sure, go for it. What's the name of your business? Mobile Motto. I do on-site repairs. Well, I don't have a shop yet. How do you advertise? Word of mouth, referrals. So no website or anything? No, no website. I think I can definitely step up your business, Andrew. Sounds good. Looking forward to it. Hey, dad. Check this out. What you got, buddy? Wow! Nice work. That's amazing. Do you wanna see the logo I made for Josh's business? Yeah! Brendan, that is great. That's professional. You know what, you should be my partner. I'll do the marketing, you do the design work. What do you think? I'd love that dad. I'll make you proud. Brendan, I'm already proud of you. Hi! Hi, Lori, come on in. Hey. Andrew told me your brother and sister in-law are staying here and I just wanna introduce myself. Tara's in the other room. I'll go get her. Go ahead and take a seat. Hi. Hi. I'm Lori. Andrew's wife. Oh, okay. Owners of Mobile Motto, right? Yeah, yeah. That's why I'm here. Oh, okay. I am so excited about the amount of work that Andrew's been getting since your husband started his marketing business. He's been getting a lot of business? Almost more than he could handle. It is such a blessing! Oh, that's great. And just a real answer to our prayers. I wanted to let you know that we have referred you on to several other of our friend and they're trying to get their business started too. Really? Wow! That's great. I really appreciate it. Thanks. Thank you really. If there's anything that I can do for you please let me know. Thanks, I will. Oh, and I baked you this bread as a thank you. You bake bread? Yeah. Now that is something that you could do for me. I would love to learn how to make bread. I would love to teach you anytime. Okay. Hey, Josh? Hey, Rachel, have you seen Josh? He's out on a date. Yeah, he takes the kids out once a week on daddy date. He's out with Sarah right now. What do they do on their dates? Different things each week. He usually let's the kids choose the activity. You know how cheap Josh is. He finds fun and endless things to do for free. You know what, you just give me the inspiration I was praying for. I'll see you later. Hey Pal. What are you working on? Wow! That's amazing! Matthew 5:16. Why did you choose that? Well, Cameron read it to me when I visited him. It really touched him and it did the same to me. You did an amazing job capturing it in your drawings. Well, this is me, dad. Before Cameron's accident, I wasn't doing anything bad but I wasn't really doing anything good either. Not doing anything bad and doing good are very different things. You know what, you're right. You're not the only one that's learning that. Wait a second, Brendan. That's it. Good works. Good Works Marketing and Design. It's a perfect name for our family business. What do you think? I like it. You get started on the logo. We're in business. You just have to take it from here. I don't know Josh. I don't want to blow it again. You're ready. You're on the right track spiritually and financially. Yeah, but what if the work is not there and I can't afford the rent? I can't let my family fall again. I'm not saying that it's going to be easy or that you won't struggle but you have to have faith. Josh, faith is the hardest part. You understand what didn't work. Now you understand God's laws, all you have to do is apply what you've learned and what you know. That's easy for you to say. You're naturally a better father and leader than I am. I don't know if I have what it takes. That's fear speaking and it will only shut you down. Forget it. Concentrate on the vision you have for your family. What if I don't have a vision for my family? I mean concentrate on the big picture, your role as a father. I don't understand what my role as a father has to do with it. Your role as a father is to preside over, provide for and protect his family. If you do those three things to the best of your ability and with the help of the lord you will be the kind of leader and father God wants in your home. How does my little brother have all the answers? I don't but I know where to find them. God's way. You know what Josh there's something I got to do. I'll see you later. Dad, where are we going? It's a surprise hence the blindfold. Okay, go to the right grass. Right there. Wow! I know it's not what you expected but it's all for you. Sweetheart, I can't believe you're 16 years old. It seems like just yesterday your mom and I held you for the first time. You were so little. Now you're a beautiful young woman and I'm very blessed to be your dad. Thanks dad. I got something for you. This ring represents my love for you. It's a symbol of my love and my commitment to lead you. It's also a reminder that your heart belongs to me until the day a worthy man comes along and takes you in marriage and gives you a ring that symbolizes his love and commitment for you. I love you dad. I love you too. Happy birthday! And I promise you'll have a real party soon, okay? Okay! Let's eat. I got you your favorites. I hope you're hungry. Yes, I am. * The greatest house, the finest cars. * * Have we lost sight in who we are? * * When worldly gain is all we see, our life's on sinking sand. * * Our life's on sinking sand. * * All is gone lost sight in what is true. * * Now we look to you, yes we look to you. * * Stand strong as our world is fading, stand strong * * in Christ, our foundation. * Stand strong even in adversity surrounding us * * in tragedy, we'll stand strong. * * Life is crashing down on us * * and all these false stability's * * Our hopes and dreams Hey, can I get everybody's attention? I'm glad you guys came, Cameron is home. Yey! * All is gone lost sight in what is true. * * Now we look to you, yes we look to you. * * Stand strong as our world is fading, stand strong * * in Christ, our foundation. * Stand strong even in adversities surrounding us * * in tragedy, we'll stand strong. * Well, the summer started with the party and it's ending with one too. It's summer I won't forget. It's too bad Cameron's gotta go back to school so soon. Well, actually if you approve I was thinking maybe he wouldn't? What? I've seen too much of a lifestyle I've grown to love. I love it way too much to go back to the old way. What do you mean? I'd like to home school him. Really?! I've missed too much of his childhood. I don't want to miss another minute. I think it's a great idea. Really? Hey, what do you guys think of my new ride? Oh. Wow! That's great. Check it out. Megan, what do you think? Do you still wanna drive my car? Oh yeah? Oh, I almost forgot something. I got something for you. Oh that's perfect. Look at that. Well, I'm wanna take you for a ride. Come on. Let's go. Right now? Yup! Just mom. Oh! Alright, we wont wait up. Alright. Mint chocolate chip? Thank you. Just like our first date. You remember that? What kind of shake I had? Why wouldn't I? This is where it all began. We were two kids drinking our milk shakes and finding our lives together. Here we are again almost 20 years later. Drinking milk shakes and starting over, this time with a new plan. A new plan. We could do this, Tara. I wanna do it different this time. This time I want to give you my best. This time I wanna give God my best. I promise we'll make it work. Well Alright, Cameron, you're on the first row, okay? This is it. First pick! Nice. What do you think? It's awesome. Hand me those crutches. Help you out, buddy? You guys wanna go pick out your bed rooms. Oh yeah. Yes. Well, we made it. Tonight is our last night at Josh and Rachel's. I think I'm actually gonna miss it. Come on. Wait till you see the inside. And the question is will it all fit? You can always put Brendan out in a tent. Josh, I don't know how to thank you. You don't have to. That's what families do. I think you know that now. Yeah, but I really appreciate it. Can I go home yet? No, I don't appreciate that much. We got more work to do. Oh, Rachel. This is what you taught me. The most important things in life aren't things. Aren't things. Amen! And the best part is I got it at a yard sale for 2 dollars. That's almost free. Dad? Yeah, honey? You're right. I don't need a boyfriend. I just wanna let you know. That's my girl. I'm proud of you sweetheart. Matt? Yeah, mom? I love you. I love you too, mom. Look I'm sorry I put you in that position. Let me finish. Matt, you and your family are so precious to me. I hope you know that. Yours and Josh's family are my legacy and you're my reason for living. And I want you to know that it's been a great wonderful privilege to watch you grow into a man and into a father and into a servant of the lord. I know your father is so proud of you. And I also know he's looking down on you and really feeling the joy that I feel too. I just had so much in my heart. I had to let it spill out. I love you to mom. Looks, great. I hope you guys are hungry. It's really good. >>Nice job mom! What are you doing? I thought that was for decoration? It is. But, you know, this candle represents who I was, beautiful maybe, but not very useful. It had a better chance of melting in storage done bringing down from use. I wanna burn myself out from use. I want to let my light so shine before men that they may see my good works and glorify my father which is in heaven. I can't tell you how grateful I am for these difficult trials that we've been through for the last couple of months. If everything haven't fallen apart we could have never rebuilt our lives so beautifully. I know he loves me. That is beautiful. Yes. I love you too. Dinner looks great. Thank you. Cameron, do you remember when you ask me if I believe in miracles? Yeah. Well, I do. Tara? Mom, are you having another baby? Yes! Are you serious? Serious? Oh, wow! It's great. Wow! This is a celebration. Let's eat! Let's eat. Oh wait. Who's saying the prayer? Ah, Cameron? * The greatest house, the finest cars. * * Have we lost sight in who we are? * * When worldly gain is all we see, our life's on sinking sand. * * Our life's on sinking sand. * * All is gone lost sight in what is true. * * Now we look to you, yes we look to you. * * Stand strong as our world is fading, stand strong * * in Christ, our foundation. * Stand strong even in adversity surrounding us * * in tragedy we'll stand strong. * * Life is crashing down on us and all these false stability's. * * My life is crashing down on us and all these false stability's. * * Our hopes and dreams they fade away, * * our life's on sinking sand. * * Our life's on sinking sand. * * All is gone lost sight in what is true. * * Now we look to you, yes, we look to you. * * Stand strong as our world is fading, stand strong * * in Christ, our foundation. * Stand strong even in adversity surrounding us * * in tragedy we'll stand strong. * * By pride in earthly treasure. * * We will stand. * No longer in this world are we measured. * * Stand strong as our world is fading, stand strong * * in Christ, our foundation. * Stand strong even in adversity surrounding us * * in tragedy we'll stand strong. * * We'll stand strong.
