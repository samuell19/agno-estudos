Yeah, I know it's been awhile. How are ya doing? Look, I'm sorry to call you so late. I'm gonna be in town the next couple of days and I was wondering if I could stay at your place for awhile. No, everything's cool. I, I just need to get out of the city for awhile. Hey, great. I'll be there in the morning. Thanks, Deke. Bye.

(slow piano music) - Damn good to see ya, buddy. You get lost? - What? - I thought you were getting here earlier this morning? - Oh, yeah, I did a little sight seeing. So all this is yours now? - Yep, the folks moved out about five years ago. Dad's work moved him to London so they let me keep the place. I can barely afford it, but someday, it'll all be mine. You sounded pretty weird last night. You're not running from the law by any chance are ya? (laughs) - [Tyge] I'm afraid not. - [Deke] Damn Ah well, you look like you could use a drink. I'm buying. - Can I get you anything else? - I don't think so. - All right, enjoy your meal. - Thanks. I guess it's been, what, 10 years? - Has it been that long? - [Deke] Shit, we're gettin' old. - I haven't heard anything about a reunion yet. Have you? - No, and that's fine with me. Shit, half of our class were fucking morons. Those were the ones that never left town. I see them every day. Case in point. You remember Zack Ledanakoh, right? - [Tyge] I think so. - Oh sure you do. He ran the school radio station. You know the one you couldn't even pick up in the parking lot? - [Tyge] Okay. - Zack! - [Zack] Hey, you just get here? - [Deke] Yep, thought we'd get a couple drinks and do some catching up. - Cool. - [Zack] Sup Tyge, how you been? I heard you moved to L.A. years ago. - [Tyge] L.A.'s not really my scene. - [Zack] So how long are you going to be in town? - I'm not sure yet. - Still making movies? Oh, I heard there are still a few copies floating around of that shitty horror movie you made back when we were in high school. A friend of mine down at Sunny's Video Shack, remember that place? - Yeah, I used to work there. - He told me they still have a copy of it. What was the name of that thing? Dark something. It was Dark... - Dark Aura. - That's right, man, oh geez, that shit was painful. - Whew, it's been an experience talking with you again, Zack. I gotta make a phone call. Are you ready for another one? - [Deke] I'm still working on this one. - All right. - What? - What was that? Why are you acting like a little bitch? - Relax, I was just playing with him. - [Deke] Anyway, Tyge is going to be staying with us for a couple of days. - What? Why? - He's my best friend. I haven't seen him in years. - Yeah, well he gives me the creeps. - Zack, no offense byt sometimes you give me the creeps. - Oh no, I am not coming down there tonight. Look, hello. Hello, I can barely hear ya, man. Oh, look, can't this wait until tomorrow? I mean I already gave them a statement. Look, are they charging you with anything? Well then tell them I wiLL be there tomorrow. You're my agent, make something up. That's what you do best. (sighs) What time do you want me to be there? (sighs) Hello. John. Hello! (sighs) Oh shit. Ashley. - Don't hit me. - Oh, no, I just... I lost the signal. What are you doing here? - I came to get a drink. - No, I mean, what are you doing back in town? - Is that all you can say? - It's been a long time, Ash. I just didn't expect us to run into each other like this, you know, I mean, I haven't seen you since-- - Graduation. 10 years. We're gettin' old. (slow piano music) Well, I think I'm just going to go. - Well wait, I mean, how have you been? I mean, are you here visiting family? - Kinda. Well, my sister's dead. - Diana. My god. - Wrong one. - Mikki? Ash, what happened? - Well, she killed herself. - I'm... I'm so sorry. - Yeah, I don't, I don't know why I came here. I've got all this running around to do and everything. I'm staying at my parents house while I'm in town. Do you need the number? - I remember it. Call me. If you want. - Are you gonna be okay? - I'll be fine. - Whoa, calm down loverboy. Was that who I think it was? Yeah. (laughs) And how is the fine Ms. Lomack doing? Is something wrong? - She said her sister Mikki just passed away. What? - Mikke died back in '98, man. - But-- - [Deke] I shit you not. She was living with her grandparents at the time. She didn't get along with her folks too well. Anyway, the police found her in the basement. Cuts all over her body. Blood everywhere. Oh, you know what's real fucked up about that? On the night that Mikki died, her grandparents were killed in a car accident. Brake failure I think. (scoffs) Lovely story huh? - I never head anything about that. And Ash just made it sound like it happened yesterday. - Well, come on, let's go. I can only take Zack in small doses. - So why didn't Zack get into radio? I seem to remember him being pretty good at it. - [Deke] You mean that was the only thing he was good at. Well, Zack was in radio for awhile. The local news, sports broadcast here and there. Nothing too spectacular. (sighs) When his aunt, uncle, and cousin died, he pretty much lost interest in that. Pretty much lost interest in everything. - Oh yeah. Weren't they some of those people that were murdered back up in Ditmer back in '93? What? (upbeat rock music) Damn. What a slob. So how long has Zack been living with you? - [Deke] Too long. He was going through a lot of shit so I thought I'd be helping the guy out by letting him move in, you know? That's what I get for thinkin'. ("I Sold My Soul To A Frankenhooker" by Frankenhookers) - What's this? - [Deke] Hang on. Ah, here it is. That marking is for the vulture deity. - Excuse me, the what? - Listen to this. (suspenseful music) - [Male Voice On Tap] A shocking and bizarre event in Jefferson County last night. Wendell Ledanakoh age 39 brutally murdered and partially devoured six victims including her husband, Gary Ledanakoh. The mass murder took place on the Ledanakoh's property in Ditmer, Missouri. Authorities were told of the killings by Mikki Lomack age 22. Lomack was with the party that was murdered but managed to escape. Authorities who arrived to take Mrs. Ledanakoh into custody say that Ledanakoh was obviously in a state of deteriorated mental health. Ledanakoh is currently being held at Harrison Mental Institution in St. Louis. In other news... The Gateway Arch. - [Female On Tape] You are listening to KMJW News and-- - Bizarre huh? - That's how he found ut about the murders? I had no idea. - Gary, Lynn, and Karen was his only family. It really fucked him up. That was the end of his radio career. - So what's the deal with these notebooks? Is Zack researching for something? - They belonged to his Uncle Gary. After the investigation, the police just handed them over to Zack. Those two used to do all kinds of shit together. Anything with a history to it. They'd go to civil war reenactments. They'd research local ghost stories. That's what got him interested in all of the Indian legends and myths about the area. - What's the deal with these rocks. - Zack's notebooks say that there was a Cherokee tribe that settled in the area, after they fled the Trail of Tears, back in the late 1830's. One of the tribe's spiritual elders started messing around with this black magic and communicating with demons. Each of the symbols are supposed to represent a different demon that the elders had cahoots with. oN the morning of their annual harvest, the tribe went out to the fields and found that all of their crops had been turned into stones. Each of the stones had an animal marking on it. Just like this one. - That's creepy. - [Deke] The elder was killed and most of the tribe fled the land, fearing now that it was cursed. Most of 'em froze to death that winter. - Damn. - The rocks became passageways for the demons that now roam the land to possess anyone that make physical contact with them. The demon whose symbol is on the rock is the one that possesses you. The demon supposedly won't awaken and have the ability to possess you unless one of the descendents of that Cherokee elder guy steps onto the cursed land. I think Zack and Gary made translations for over 40 demons in all. - Huh. They've got the spider. And the scorpion. The bobcat's. And the boar. Snake. And the wolf. The vulture. Ah, leech. Thanks. Here's a weird one. - What? - The demon man. If someone touches a rock with the man demon symbol on it, they are possessed by the most dangerous demon of all. Someone possessed by the man demon won't attack and kill like an animal. It thinks. It will plan ways to have as much control over as many other human beings as possible. All that from touching a rock? What's this stuff about invisible barriers? - Let me see. Oh, yeah, that's just part of the legend, man. - Hmmph. So does Zack really think that there's a connection between these stories and his family being killed? - Think it'll make a good movie, Tyge? - Dammit, you scared the shit out of me. What are you doing home so soon? (sighs) - Why do you think? - You got fired again. What is that, three jobs in two months? What, are you going for some kind of record? - You couldn't resist, could ya? - Zack, I was just telling him about some Indian legends. It's no big deal. ("Alone In The City of Robots" by Adair) (answering machine beeps) - [Judy On Answering Machine] Mason, hello, it's mom. Just calling to see if you're planning on stopping by to see me on Sunday. Your Fall break starts today, right? If I'm not here when you show up, I might be stopping by the old Lomack's farm. I've got some clients coming by next week to take a look at the place, if you can believe it. Well, I guess that's it. Call me when you get this. Say hi to Jessica for me. I can't wait to meet her. I love you, baby, bye. (slow piano music) - Friends? - Sure. - See ya tomorrow, Mason. (TV plays in background) (doorbell rings) (upbeat rock music) - Hi. - You up for a ride? ("My Wish" by Somnia) - There's the old pharmacy where my mom used to work. - It looks a little run down. - It's been abandoned for years. I don't know why they haven't torn it down yet. I remember liking Autumn a lot more when I was little. I used to take these walks in the woods behind my parent's house. I remember how quiet the woods were. Not a sound. The leaves were gone. The woods looked like they stretch on forever. I can't stand the quiet now. - So where are we going anyway? I'm almost afraid to ask. - [Ashley] You'll see. You'll get a kick out of it, trust me. - Like that ever got me anywhere. - Nice to see some things haven't changed. Same old Tyge. - Where are we? Ash. (eerie piano music) Are you okay? What is this place? - It's the old Ledanakoh property. - Are you shittin' me? Hey, hey, where do you think you're goin'? - I'm going to take a look around. Are you coming or not? - What do you think you're going to find, Ash? I mean, come on, I don't think you really want to be putting yourself through this. - Aren't you the least bit curious? (sighs) (sighs) (sinister music) There's nothing there. There's nothing. There's nothing there. There's nothing there. (sinister music) (gasping) (screams) - Ashley! Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Hey, Ashley. Come here, come here. Wake up, Ash, come on. (Ashley screams) - No, no! - It's me. - No, no. - It's me, it's all right. - The blood. - Your nose is bleeding, your nose is bleeding. Are you okay, Ash? - No, where's-- - [Tyge] What, did you see something? - I guess I got dizzy. (sinister piano music) - Here. Take these. And you should probably still see a doctor. - Oh, I'll live. - Here. Take a look at these. (macabre music) - Where did you find them? - Well, Deke Myrick showed me this at his house last night. Remember Zack Ledanakoh? Well, he's living with Deke, he's got a whole bunch of these. I found this one up at the Ledanakoh place. - Why are you keeping them? - Well, Deke was telling me this really weird story about where they came from and, I just thought maybe you'd know something about it. - Why? - Well, you know, because of Mikki. - Sorry, Sherlock. I'm not in the mood to play right now. I'm just going to take a nap and try to shake this headache, okay? - Ash, you do know what I'm talking about, right? - Yes, Tyge. I've heard all of Zack's stories before and that's all they are, stories. - Yeah, well... I'll be downstairs if you need anything. Your parents aren't going to be home any time soon, are they? - Not for another week. They're still in Florida on vacation. - Good. - You think you're pretty tough, don't ya? - Oh, my god, you've got to be kiddin' me. It's time you die like the bitch you are. - Oh man. (TV plays in background) What the hell. - [Mikki] I feel myself rotting from the inside. - What the-- - My work here is done. There's nothing left for me to do. (crying) Ashley, I need your help. They're coming for me. I don't know what they're going to do when they find me. (crying) Ashley, please help me. (sinister music) - Oh, that prick. (sighs) ("Quicksand" by Rockgodsuperstar) (doorbell rings) - [Zack] Deke, get the fucking door! (doorbell rings) What? - Is Deke home? - No. - What the fuck is your problem, man? - What the hell's that? - Don't pretend you didn't send this to Ashley. - Man, are you out of your fucking mind? - I'm not here to play games with you, Zack. I know you have a copy of this in your bedroom. - Okay, okay. - Where did you get that tape? Why did you send it to her? - None of your fucking business. - Oh yeah, it becomes my fucking business when your stupid little mind games drive my friend to a mental breakdown. Hasn't she been through enough, you fucking psycho? (grunts) - Don't ever call me that. I know the tape was a little dramatic but I know she wants those answers as much as I do. Where did you get that? - Near your uncle's place. I went there with Ashley this afternoon. These the answers you're looking for? I know you've been through a lot, Zack, but this... (sighs) This answers nothing. - Those stories that Deke told you last night, that was just a game for me, something to pass the time. But, after the murders, the more I tried to figure out exactly what happened that night, the less it seemed like a game to me. Maybe it was just my imagination getting the best of me or maybe it just took something like this to show me the truth that had been there all along. (eerie music) - This is crazy, Zack. Do you really expect for me to take this stuff seriously? - Read first, then decide. (sighs) - Tyge! Tyge! (sinister music) (screaming) (Ashley screams) (macabre music) (gasps) (eerie music) (screaming) Mikki. - [Tyge] This is the second time I've found her knocked out. She might have a concussion. - [Deke] Why didn't you call of ran ambulance? What are we supposed to do for her? - [Zack] Man, she don't look too good. - [Tyge] I knew I shouldn't have left her alone. - Looks like she took one too many trips to happy land. - Holy shit. - What are they for? - It's for nightmares. Like the one I'm having right now. Get your own. - I'll be in the kitchen. Coffee's on. - Why... Why did you send me that tape? - I'm sorry if the package was a little-- - Fucking morbid. - I know this is difficult for you, Ash, but I've lost people that I care about too. - Yeah and that's the only reason I haven't fucking ripped your balls off yet. Look, Zack, I don't know anything that you don't already know. Mikki didn't talk to me much after the murders at the Ditmer, I mean, She didn't talk to much of anybody after that. - Do you think Mikki may have left a journal or a diary, something that would give us an indication of what was going on in her head when she committed suicide? Something that would give us some details about the murders. - I don't think so. What are you looking for? - I'm wondering if maybe she wrote something down about what happened that night. - You already know what happened. Six people were killed, Mikki flipped out and killed herself five years later. End of story. - Just hear me out, okay? - Okay, talk. - A friend of mine, a cop, he showed me some crime scene photos of the victims. He's also who hooked me up with the copy of the tape that I sent you. Besides the fatal wounds on the victims, there were other, anomalies found on the bodies. - Like what? (eerie music) - My aunt died exactly a year after she was committed back in '93. There was nothing anybody could ever do for her. In the end she was like this animal, completely void of human self awareness. Just wasn't anything left inside at all. - [Deke] Fuck. Did she die in a fire? - [Tyge] They just found her like that? - [Zack] Just a shriveled husk. Her skin split open like road kill frying on hot asphalt. It was as if she'd rotted from the inside. - Is there a point to all of this. - I've known my aunt my whole life, Ashley. She'd never hurt anyone. Reports say she killed six people but I do not believe that. - Zack, what's going on, buddy? - [Zack] Something got to my aunt that made her go insane. - That's it. Zack please, I'm leaving. - Something got to my aunt, the same thing that Mikki saw that night. - You're sick, I want, all of you to get the hell out right now. - The same thing that made Mikki kill herself. - I said get out! Right now, I'm not listening to this shit anymore. Get out, Tyge, now! - Ashley would you calm down. We're only trying to help. - No, I came here to get away from this. Not listen to this bullshit. Hooray, hooray, at long last I finally found out why my sister slit her wrists and bled to death all over my grandparents farm. How stupid of me. I should've known all along. Mikki just came down with a nasty case of demonitis, right? Well thank you Dr. Murdock. Thank you Dr. Ledanakoh for your in depth clinical observation. I can finally put it all behind me. - Ashley, please, what do you want me to say? - Nothing, why bother, it won't change anything. Are you having fun? Is this amusing to you seeing me like this, knowing full well you don't have the faintest fucking idea what I've been through? - No, I am trying to help-- - I'm sorry you don't understand. I really am. I don't understand it all myself. And maybe I never will. But maybe his is how Zack decides to deal with it by playing a stupid game. But it's not a game, Tyge. People are dead and you're looking for some reason, some cause that doesn't even fucking exist. Do me a favor, look for it somewhere else. All of you. I'm not going to be a part of this anymore. You guys go on your scavenger hunt without me. Don't let me ruin all the fun. I'm going back home tomorrow and forgetting I ever fucking came back here. - Ash. - That's for being a bastard. And for not being here when I needed you. Sorry I kicked your ass, nothing personal. - Well, that could've gone better. - I think I'm starting to get use to this. - That was fun. Thank you both so much for making me a part of that. Now unless you have an encore planned, I really need to split. I got some work I need to finish up for a project on Monday. - I want to go look around her grandparents farm. - What? - There must be something there that Mikki wanted Ashley to find, I mean, why else would she make that tape? - Don't you think the cops would've found whatever it is you're looking for? They searched the house after Mikki died. - Why would the cops do an extensive search of the house if the house was ruled a suicide? They had no reason to suspect foul play. There must be something there the cops overlooked. - Which would take forever to find. Man, you don't even know what it is you're looking for. Or if there's even anything there to find. - [Zack] What would it hurt to go out there and just look around? - Count me out. I'm just going to stay around here and keep an eye on Ashley. - Call us if you change your mind.

Sorry. - I noticed. - I am sorry. - I'm sorry, too. Because I miss my medication. - You never did tell me why you came back. - I guess I was looking for something that I didn't really need to know. But, I wanted to remember Mikki the way she was. That's what was real. It's just all this demon shit's starting to get a little too morbid for me. - Afraid you'll find monsters? You know, when I was 11 years old, I asked God to turn me into a monster. (laughs) I even covered my ass and told him I'd be a good monster. - Okay. That's interesting. Why may I ask would you ask for something like that? - I wanted to keep my dad from beating my mom. But, God never answered me. It was too late. (sighs) We were about to do this shot for a new film project I'm working on in St. Louis when I, I just stepped out to take a phone call, two of the actors were going to run over some blocking, the light fell from the scaffolding and hit one of the actors on the head. It split it wide open. Blood everywhere. (sighs) My whole life's been a fantasy. It's been make believe. But at that moment, at that one moment, it was, it was like I was 11 years old again, afraid, alone. (eerie music) - It wasn't your fault, Tyge. (Tyge sighs) - Apparently dad was released from prison a couple of years ago. So I, went by the old house to see if he still lived there. - Why? - Well, I wanted to show him that I'm not that scared little boy he can hurt anymore. But, he moved away. I don't know, maybe I'm still that scared little boy, scared that one day I'll look like my father. - [Ashley] Tyge, don't be ridiculous. - Life just seems so meaningless. Trivial. - Chasing monsters isn't going to change that. There was a part of me that wanted to believe in Zack's stories too, but look where it got him. His life is consumed by it. I don't want to live my life like that. And neither should you. - Maybe there is no magic in the world. - Maybe you're just looking for it in the wrong place. (garage door motor whines) - Ugh. - Shit, what is that? Eh, it smells like your mom's making some of her famous ass chili again. Whew. (scoffs) - Meat must have gone bad. (slow piano music) (sighs) Guess we'll just wait for mom to get back from her jog. - [Ashley] Did you want to go with Deke and Zach to my grandparents farm? - [Tyge] We don't have to, Ash. - [Ashley] It'll give me a chance to say goodbye to the place. - [Tyge] Okay. - [Zack] This place doesn't look all that fuckin' abandoned. - [Deke] I think they're just renting out the land, you know, if you want to put your cows here or something. - [Zack] How do you know that there's not somebody here right now? - [Deke] I think it's just the cows, man. - [Zack] This is off to a great start. Yep, creepy just like I imagined. - Let's get this over with. - I can see why nobody's bought the place yet. - Come on, sweetie, let's check out the big scary red barn. - You wanna go check out the lake? - That's fine with me. - You guys want to look around the house? - Mm, maybe later. But there is a door around back that leads down into the basement. The locks always been busted. - All right, give me an hour to look around. - [Deke] Who wants a roll in the hay? - That should give me enough time to hide Deke's body. - [Deke] You don't know what you're missing. I'll be the needle in your haystack. (slow piano music) (sinister music) (door squeaks) (foreboding piano music) - Is something wrong? - It's weird being back here. I've been gone way too long. (slow ominous piano music) (stairs squeak) (ominous piano music) (scoffs) - Fuck this. - The last time I saw Mikki, we were helping a cousin move into an apartment in the city. I remember Mikki was really quiet that day. And just before I left, she gave me this. It wasn't long after that when those five kids went missing up at that church summer camp where she used to work. They found the kids in the lake a week later. And they were all drowned. (sighs) Yep, that wasn't a very good year. (ominous music) (sighs) - [Deke] You two have fun? I know I sure did. Is he okay? - Mm, I don't know. So, where's your better half? - He's probably still in the house. Well? Ready to give up yet? - Hey. - How you doing? Whatcha working on? - A story for creative writing. Except I've been in this writer's block all week. So I've just been trying word association to work around it. - Not much happening? - Not really, but you look like you've got a lot on your mind. - It's probably nothing but I think I'm going to take a quick walk down to the Lomack farm and see if Mom's there. - Why don't you just call down there? - The phone's still disconnected. Besides, I need to get some fresh air anyway. - You need some company? (ominous music) - Oh, Zack, this is very interesting. We can watch it at my place. I got to get going anyway, tyge needs to get going. - I'm fine. I just got a little dizzy. - I don't want to leave yet. There's still some areas of the house I haven't checked out. - You're unbelievable. - What? - You don't know when to quit do you? - What the hell are you talking about? - This is what I'm talking about. Look familiar? Do you really expect us to believe you found this stuff lying around the house? - I didn't find it lying around. I found it in the closet in the bedroom upstairs. - Dammit, why don't you knock this shit off, Zack? - Why don't you fuck off? - What did you say? - Why can't you see what's happening here? I wouldn't pretend to find this stuff. Why would I do that? All right look, I don't care if you guys believe me or not. Something really fucked is going on here. Okay, I'm not making this up. - Okay. I've had enough of this. You want to play Nancy Drew, that's fine, but do it on your own. When you guys are ready to leave, I'll be outside. - Deke, listen. - No, you listen to me. I was willing to play along at first. I foolishly thought that maybe you would come around. But you'll always be a fucking psycho. - I'm not a psycho. (melancholy piano music) - [Mason] Jessica tells me you're moving into her place. - [Zoe] Yeah, big sister commune. But I didn't have much of a choice. My parents kicked me out a week ago. - Sorry to hear that. - Ah screw 'em. I'm a lot happier with Jess anyway.. - At least someone is. (slow piano music) Who the hell is that? - [Zoe] Maybe your mom's meeting some people to show 'em the place. Isn't that her job? - Come on. - [Zoe] Excuse me, what are we doing? - [Mason] What's it look like? Looking for my scatter-brained mother. - [Zoe] Oh lay off, I think your mom's sweet. Hey, did she sell small poshy jocks? - [Mason] Probably. (laughs) - [Zoe] Awesome. - I don't know about that. I really hate having to come home to see that sad look in her eyes. - Because of your dad? - [Mason] Yep. I know it's been six years since he's died. She still insists she's okay but, I know better. - Hey, you know, I was thinking, what if that guy you saw was some kind of deranged murderer just posing as a client. You ever think about that? Huh, huh? - This would definitely be a good place for one. (cows moo) Hello. - [Zoe] Okay, you need to share whatever it is that you're on. There's nobody here, dude. - Maybe he's shy. - Or maybe we should go back to the house and look for your mom there. - What? (growling) (Mason screams) (screaming continues) - Mason. - Did you kill him? - Yeah, I think so. (growling) Mason, we've got to get out of here. Come on, get up. You can do it, come on. (grunting) Somebody help! Help us! (sinister music) - Fuck. - Deke! - Deke! - What's wrong with you? - Get away from him. He'll kill you. - No! - Deke! - Here, he gets near, you hit him. - What the fuck, Deke? - Ah. (eerie music) Ah. (growls) - Get the fuck off of me. - Are you okay? - Get him in the heart. - What? - Get him in the heart. Run, do it. Do it! (sinister music) What's happening? (eerie music) (sighs) - Who is he? - According to his wallet, his name's Mason Kerrigan. He's lucky. Any farther and it would've punctured his brain. He's lost a lot of blood though. (monas in pain) (sinister music) - I'm going to get my notes. We're gonna need 'em. - He's not holding up too well. - It isn't every day you kill your best friend. (sighs) How can this all be happening? All of Zack's stories, they're all true. Guess he found what we were looking for after all. - The girl's gone. (sinister music) (suspenseful music) (gasps) - Oh, oh. (screams) - Did you hear that? - Who do you think it is? - Mom. - Hey, hey, listen, please don't move. Be still. Do you live around here? - My mom, she lives up on the hill. (grunts) - [Tyge] Are we going to just sit around here and do nothing? - Where's Zoe? - [Zack] She's running around out there. - She's resting on the couch in the living room. - [Tyge] We should be anywhere rather than sitting around on our asses. - Tyge's right, Zack. We'll check out the immediate front area. We'll come right back if we don't find them. Keep a close eye on him. (eerie music) (Sinister music) (heavy breathing) (growling) (screams) (Screams) (coughing) (grunting in pain) (coughing) - Hey, you sure you don't want some? You never know. It might be edible. - [Jessica] It's been over two hours, Lee. Something's wrong. - [Lee] Hey relax, I'm sure everything's going to be cool. Pardon me, but didn't you and Mason part ways yesterday? What's with the sudden concern? - I still care about him, Lee. I still want to be his friend. - You know I never could figure out the whole relationship thing. All that unnecessary work just for a little pussy. - Nice. Must be rough still being a virgin. - Yeah, thanks. (loud banging outside) What the hell was that? - It's probably just Mason, he's always screwing with us. Come on cowboy, don't worry. I'll protect ya. (eerie music) Bastard. - What? - Not you. The prick knows I don't like being scared. Come on, screw them, I'm freezing out here. - Wait a minute. What the hell is that? (eerie music) - Well, now what? - I think we should make a run for the other house. Take a look at what's on that videotape. - Are you out of your mind? - Zack, do you think that's such a good idea? I mean, we shouldn't leave Mason here like this. - We'll just have to take him with us. - That tape is not worth risking our necks for. We're safer here. Why don't you look over your notes or something? - Yeah, isn't there something in there that let's us know how to get out of this place? - That would be a bit difficult. Since they're gone. (sinister music) Wouldn't happen to know where my notes went would you, Tyge? - You accusing me of something? - I just want my notes back that you stole. - Tyge, that's enough. - I didn't steal your goddamn notes. Why the hell would I do that? - Maybe you didn't want us to leave. (sighs) - All right, maybe I did take your notes. But I got one question for ya? Did you happen to touch any of those rocks you found upstairs? - [Ashley] Zack? - How very interesting. You're one of them, aren't you? Didn't you think any of us would think of that possibility after what happened to Deke? - What the hell is he talking about? - He's a fucking liar. - Oh come on, Ash, can't you see what's going on here? He's possessed and he's trying to cover himself. He's been leading us around in circles since the first moment we got here. - Shut your fucking mouth. - Hey! (banging on door) - [Jessica] Hello, somebody there, anybody? - Who's that? (Jessica screams) - It's Jessica. You gotta let her in. - Okay, okay, shh. Calm down, calm down. We'll get it. (Jessica bangs on door) - [Jessica] Somebody help me, please. - We'll get her. Tyge, come on. (banging on door continues) now, Tyge, come on. (eerie music) - Ash, we've got to do something about this. After what he just did in there, who knows. What's her name, Zoe? - Shut up. - He might have killed that girl. (banging on door continues) (sinister music) Think about what you're doing, Ashley. - [Jessica] Somebody please let me in. - He'll kill us. It's too late. There's no other way. (growling) (Jessica screams) (sinister music) (growls) (Ashley screams) - Block this door, block this door. I gotta go get Zack and Mason. - Hurry. - Come on, we have to go. - [Zack] What's going on out there? - [Ashley] One of those things got in the house. Can you walk? - I can make it. (Tyge screams) - Tyge. - Ashley, no. (eerie music) - Zoe! (growling) - Move, go. No lock on the door. Get out of here. Help me. Get out of the way. We gotta find a screwdriver. - How are you holding up? - Dizzy but I'll live. (menacing music) - Let's go, you okay, man? - Tyge. Tyge, where are you? Where the hell is he? I left him right three. - Forget about him, Ash, he's gone. - No. - Come on, let's go, let's go. (slow sinister music) (growling) - [Zack] Let's go, let's go. Down here. Go ahead. (slow sinister music) (screaming) - Jessica. (growling) Lee, stop, it's me. - Look out. (Ashley screams in rage) (growling) (painful grunts) (growling) - Ashley, come on, there are more of them. Ashley! - Jessica! - [Jessica] Mason. Oh, my god. What happened to you? What's going on? - It's okay, baby. We're going to get out of this. Everything's going to be all right. Tell me what happened? - We were waiting for you. I heard a noise out on the porch. And we went out to see what it was because we thought it was you and Lee found a rock and we went back inside. He started chasing me. He's trying to kill me. - [Mason] Shh. - Why is he stopping? (growling) (Jessica growls) (yells in pain) - Hey! - [Zack] Dammit. (Lee growls) - [Ashley] Jesus. - [Mason] Ashley! (Lee growls) (screaming) - Ashley, come on. (Mason continues screaming) (upbeat sinister music) (screaming) (sinister music) It's going numb. - What the hell are we gonna do now? - We got to get to the other house. - Look, that video tape's not going to work. - I can fix it. I can give it a shot at least. (grunts) We're out of options. Behind you! (screams) (growling) (Ashley screams) Ashley! (Ashley whimpers) - Help! (sinister music) (whimpers) - You okay? Ashley. Ashley! Are you okay? - Yeah, I think so. (low howling) (upbeat macabre music) - Get ready. (growling) Back door. (upbeat suspenseful music) Come on. (banging on door) (growling) - Where are you going? - Turn that light out. Draw as little attention to ourself as possible. (slow macabre music) - What are you doing? - I'm just performing a bit of emergency surgery here. Can you shine your flashlight down here, please? (banging on door continues) (growling) - Ashley I hope you find this. I'm sorry I didn't talk to you about all this before, but you wouldn't have understood the things that I saw that night. The gift that I was given. But, the gift was never meant for me. It was always meant for you. I was running out of time. I knew that if I made the ultimate sacrifice, that you would eventually find your way home. Of course, there is always the chance that you move on with your life. That you'd forget all about me. But if you're watching this right now, I know that you still harbor the pain inside. (loud banging on door) I love you, Ashley. (slow suspenseful music) - [Ashley] What do you think she meant by that? - What? - The stuff about the gift. What the hell does that mean? - I don't know. I try to figure all this out. It doesn't make any sense. I don't know why all this is happening in the first place. The demons, the possessions, the invisible barriers. There is no Cherokee elder descendant. And I always thought the cursed grounds were on my uncle's property. So if that were the case-- - Then why is all this happening here? - It doesn't add up. - Hey, remember yesterday, when you said that there must have been something inside Mikki to make her go and kill herself? Did you mean she was possessed? - Oh shit. (growling) If Mikki was possessed, she managed to leave my uncle's property, that means the contagion is no longer confined to those grounds. It got out. - So she could spread it to other places. - When she bled all over the farm, she spread the contagion to that land. So that if a descendant from her bloodline, in this case, you, steps onto that land-- - Trap goes off. How can we get out of this, Zack? How do we stop this? - I know the story is incomplete, the last thing my uncle told me before he died was that he made some new translations that he would sit down and talk with me about them when he had some free time. After the murders, when I finally got my hands on his notes, some of the pages had been ripped out. - The pages Mikki was burning? (banging) (growling) There has to be a way out of here. There's got to be a way. - My uncle did tell me one way. He said if there's no one left alive on the cursed ground, then the barriers crumble and the demons go back to sleep. Yeah, I don't like that option much either. - Where in the hell are you going? - Garage. I can get a weapon there. Coming? Look, it doesn't make any sense for us to stay here. You know they're going to find us here eventually. If we're going to beat this thing, we've got to stop running. So come on. (suspenseful music) - [Ashley] Over here. There it is. What's wrong? - Dammit. - What's going on, Zack? What's the matter? Zack? - I need you to do me a favor. - Okay. - I need you to kill me. - What? What the fuck are you talking about? That's not funny. - My uncle was right. He was right about me. When I found those rocks in the bedroom upstairs, I couldn't believe it. You've looked for something like that your whole life and then, it's so surreal, it was fantastic, you know, I... After Deke, I knew it was a matter of time. I can feel it. It's like a sickness inside me. It's everywhere. Do it, Ash. - Zack, please, there has to be another way. - There is not other way, I can't fight it anymore. Please, Ash. - I can't do it. We have to find another way. - Ash! Kill me! Don't let me become like one of them, please. Please. Kill me. - I can't. Zack. Where are you going? - Oh, I'll be damned. - What is it? What did you find? Zack. (Zack growls) - Oh fuck! Tyge, look out. (whimpering) (sinister music) (low howling) (eerie music) (moaning) (cryptic music) (low howling) (demonic growling) (demonic growling) (chainsaw motor revving) (demonic growling) (low howling) (growling) Shit! (grunting) (gasping) (zombies growling) (chainsaw engine revving) (screaming) (pained yelling) (suspenseful music) Oh god! (tense music) (screams) (screaming) (demonic growling) No, no, no! (coughing) (pained groaning) (car engine approaching) (distorted screaming) (solemn music) (wind rustling) (solemn music)
