TRAVIS CONSIDERS FELIX HIS BEST FRIEND, BUT THE POPULAR CONSENSUS IS THAT FELIX IS DIFFICULT. FRANKLY, IF HE HAD A PERSONALITY, WHICH I DON'T THINK HE DOES, ALLY, BUT IF HE DID, UNDERNEATH IT ALL WOULD JUST BE SOME KIND OF AN ASSHOLE. YOU KNOW THOSE KIND OF PEOPLE. OH, UH, YEAH.

Miles: WHAT? OH, SHIT. STAY THERE! WHAT?! WE GOTTA KEEP IT DOWN. THE BEDROOM DOOR IS NOT SOUNDPROOF. OK, LET'S PICK SOMEBODY. HOW ABOUT-- MY MAN FELIX. IT'S GOTTA BE HIM. IT'S HIS BIRTHDAY. OK, I'LL GO GET MILES. IT'S GONNA BE YOU, BUDDY. WE CHOSE A GUY, AND HE ASKED A QUESTION LIKE, FOR INSTANCE, &quot;WHAT KIND OF CAR WOULD THIS PERSON BE?&quot; YOU WOULD SAY, LIKE, A MUSTANG. OR AN EDSEL. Ally: OH, YEAH, I'VE DONE THIS GAME. ACTING CLASS. OK, TRAVIS... IF THIS PERSON WERE-- Diane: TRAVIS? OH, JESUS. WHAT? COULD YOU COME HERE A SECOND, PLEASE? WE'RE PLAYING THE GAME. TRAVIS. JESUS. OK, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. OK. MS. SHEEDY. IF THIS PERSON WERE... A CAR, WHAT KIND OF CAR WOULD THEY BE? A MUSTANG. INTERESTING. A MUSTANG. I KNOW YOU LIKE FELIX. YEAH, FELIX IS THE MAN. YEAH, BUT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I THINK? I THINK THAT FELIX NOT ONLY IS NOT THE MAN, BUT FELIX...DOESN'T HAVE A PERSONALITY, AND BENEATH THE BANAL EXTERIOR THAT HE HAS IS JUST AN ASSHOLE. DIANE! THE ONLY REASON-- DON'T YOU PLAY STUPID, TRAVIS. THE ONLY REASON THAT THIS TURNED INTO A &quot;SORT OF&quot; BIRTHDAY PARTY FOR FELIX IS THAT I WANTED TO HAVE A DINNER PARTY. YOU WANTED TO INVITE FELIX, AND IT JUST SO HAPPENED THAT THE EVENT FELL SOMEWHERE AROUND HIS BIRTHDAY. THIS IS NOT AN EFFORT THAT COMES DIRECTLY FROM MY HEART. IF THIS PERSON WERE A BODILY FUNCTION, WHAT KIND OF A BODILY FUNCTION WOULD THEY BE? SHIT. IT'S SANDY. NO, IT'S NOT SANDY. OH, OK. I JUST THOUGHT BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS THING. AHEM. MS. SHEEDY... YOU--YOU HAVE GOT TO CALM DOWN. NO, NO, NO, I WILL NOT CALM DOWN. I'VE GOT A ROOM FULL OF HUNGRY PEOPLE OUT THERE. THEY'RE SNACKING ON PISTACHIOS. THAT'S NOT THE WAY I WAS RAISED. AND I CAN SEE BY YOUR EYES THAT WE CAN ELIMINATE PHILIP. WELL, WHY DON'T YOU TRY AND CATER SOME OF THIS? I WANT THEM TO GO. PLEASE, I WANT THEM TO GO. OH, COME ON. IF YOU LOVE ME, YOU'LL KILL THEM. I WANT 'EM TO DIE! &quot;EVERYBODY FELIX.&quot; THAT'S HORRIBLE. I'VE GOT PEOPLE OUT THERE OF MY CLASS. YOUR CLASS. DIANE-- OH, MY GOD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT? PUT THAT OUT. PUT THAT-- FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, WOULD YOU PUT THAT OUT! EVERYBODY IS SMOKING. WELL, YOU KNOW THERE IS NO SMOKING IN THIS HOUSE, TRAVIS, PLUS YOU QUIT. I DIDN'T QUIT. I-- YOU KNOW WHAT, THEY SHOULD ALL JUST PUT OUT THEIR FUCKING CIGARETTES. YEAH, RIGHT. ARE YOU GONNA GO OUT THERE AND TELL ALLY SHEEDY TO PUT OUT HER CIGARETTE? OH, YES, I WILL. YEAH, RIGHT. OK, YOU JUST WATCH ME. Miles: OK, MS. SHEEDY, IF THIS PERSON WERE A FAMOUS, NOT AS FAMOUS AS YOU, BUT A FAMOUS PERSON-- EXCUSE ME. ALLY SHEEDY, WOULD YOU PLEASE PUT THAT OUT? OH, OF COURSE. I'M SORRY. HE'LL BE HERE ANY MINUTE. I LIKE THE COFFEE IN GERMANY. YEAH. IN THE GERMANY, THEY KNOW HOW TO GRIND BEANS. ITALY HAS GOOD COFFEE, TOO, BUT IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO GRIND THE BEANS, YOU KNOW... YEAH. WELL, THEN IT'S ACIDIC. THE FOAM RISES TO THE TOP OF YOUR STOMACH, BECOMES GASEOUS. Felix: OH, DID I MISS THE COFFEE BEAN STORY? OH, GODDAMN IT! GOD, DIANE, YOU TELL THAT SO WELL. I LOVE THAT LITTLE TRIP TO EUROPE. OH, YOU KNOW, IT'S ALL IN THE GRINDING, FELLAS, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IF YOU CAN'T GRIND THE BEANS RIGHT... YOU KNOW, DIANE, EVERY TIME YOU TELL THAT STORY, IT JUST SOUNDS MORE AND MORE SPONTANEOUS. REALLY, IT'S STARTING TO SOUND LIKE REAL CONVERSATION TO ME. YOU PROMISE YOU'RE GONNA TELL IT AGAIN, DIANE? WILL YOU PROMISE? IT'S MY BIRTHDAY. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT? HAS EVERYONE SEEN THE PICTURE OF PHILIP'S KID? NO. PHIL, YOU GOT A KID? Phil: NO, I DON'T HAVE A KID. OH, YES, YES, YOU DO. FOR ONLY NICKELS A MONTH, TOO. IT'S, UH, IT'S JOBEEN, ISN'T IT? IF YOU ALL MUST KNOW, I SUPPORT A VENEZUELAN CHILD THROUGH THE INTERNATIONAL CHILDREN'S ORGANIZATION. HIS NAME ISN'T JOBEEN, IT'S JOAQUIN. Travis: THAT'S NICE, PHIL. YEAH, THAT'S MARVELOUS. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THIS IS YOUR SECOND KID NOW, ISN'T IT, PHIL? NO, NO, IT'S NOT. OH, YES, YES, IT IS, BECAUSE SOMETHING HAPPENED TO THE OTHER KID. WHY DON'T YOU TELL ALLY SHEEDY WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OTHER KID? MAYBE SHE WON'T FIND THAT SO MARVELOUS. WHY DON'T YOU JUST SHUT UP, FELIX? HEY, IF THERE WAS A SECOND KID, PHILIP, I THINK YOU OUGHT TO TELL US. YEAH. WELL, APPARENTLY, THE ORGANIZATION, I.C.O., WILL INTERVENE, AHEM, IF YOU MISS A FEW PAYMENTS. UM, IT HAD BEEN A TOUGH YEAR. YOU ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENED WITH MARGARET AND ME, AND I FORGOT A FEW THINGS-- AND THE BOY DIED. WHAT? NO, THE BOY DID NOT DIE. THEY JUST TOOK CUSTODY OF THE BOY. I'M SURE THEY GAVE HIM TO SOMEBODY ELSE, SOMEONE WHO WOULDN'T FORGET. WHY WOULD THEY TELL YOU? YOU FORFEITED YOUR RIGHT TO THAT INFORMATION. I'M SURPRISED THEY GAVE YOU ANOTHER ONE. WHY DON'T YOU JUST SHUT UP, FELIX? OH, LOOK, PHILIP. I'M HELPING YOU OUT. YOU ONLY GOT 2 STORIES-- A DIVORCED WIFE AND THE DEAD KID. NOW YOU GET TO TELL THEM BOTH. PHILIP, HOW IS MARGARET? WE HAVEN'T SEEN HER IN A WHILE. MAYBE THAT'S 'CAUSE WE GOT DIVORCED, YOU FUCKING IDIOT! WE WERE DIVORCED. IT'S BETTER THIS WAY. I THINK I--I THINK I HEAR THE FOOD. HEAR THE FOOD? I'M GONNA GIVE MARGARET A CALL. PHIL, HERE. THIS IS FOR THE BOY, JUST SOMETHING I HAD LAYING AROUND. YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE! OH, THAT'S GREAT, PHILIP. SOME BIRTHDAY THIS TURNED OUT TO BE. ALMOST GETTING PUNCHED OUT. HEY, FUCK YOU, TRAVIS. PHILIP, MAN, CALM DOWN! YEAH, PHILIP, GROW UP. SHUT UP, RECORD BOY! HEY, HEY, HEY, THAT'S IT, THAT'S IT, THAT'S IT! OK, NEUTRAL CORNERS. PHIL, WHY DON'T YOU GO OUT INTO THE HALL AND COOL DOWN, OK, HUH? I DON'T HAVE THAT HERE. PHILIP! PHILIP! GLAD YOU CAME? OH, YOU KNOW, IT'S, UH, JUST, UH, MORE GRIST FOR THE MILL. HA! WHEW. HEH!

Don: DON'T TOUCH THAT! THAT SUCKS. HAVEN'T YOU EVER NOT PAID A BILL? I HARDLY THINK IT'S THE SAME THING. BELIEVE ME, IT'S THE SAME. IT'S NOT LIKE I EVER MET THE KID. YOU KNOW, ALL I GOT IS SOME BLURRY BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOS. I'M CONVINCED THEY'RE STOCK PHOTOS. PROBABLY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES LOOKING AT THE SAME PICTURE OF LITTLE JOAQUIN. YOU DON'T REALLY MEAN ALL THAT. WELL, I MIGHT, BUT FOR THE SAKE OF THIS CONVERSATION, I'M GONNA SAY THAT I DON'T. FUCK ME. WHAT? ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY. LET'S GET READY FOR SOME MAGIC WITH DON.

DO YOU MIND IF I GO TO THE BATHROOM? WELL, IF YOU DON'T DRIBBLE ON THE TOWEL. I WON'T PUT UP WITH THAT SHIT ANY MORE. LOVERS' SPAT. HOW COULD YOU NOT KNOW YOU LOOK LIKE HITLER? YOU KNOW, EVER SINCE I GOT THE PROMOTION AND MILES DIDN'T, IT'S THESE LITTLE ACTING-OUT THINGS THAT REALLY STICK IN MY CRAW. DO YOU MIND IF I ASK YOU A QUESTION ABOUT ONE OF OUR NATIONAL TREASURES, MARLON BRANDO? I DON'T KNOW IF YOU RECALL, BUT ONE OF BRANDO'S EARLIER MOVIES PLACED MARLON ON A SHIP, A SHIP OF WAR. MARLON, THE CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP, USING ALL OF HIS ACTING SKILLS-- AND I UNDERSTAND THAT HE LIKED TO PUT NOTES AROUND THE SET BECAUSE HE DIDN'T LIKE TO MEMORIZE LINES. ANYWAY, IT WAS A STORMY NIGHT, MARLON TURNS TO HIS FIRST MATE. &quot;FIRST MATE! GET YE TO THE DECK AND GRAB THE WHEEL!&quot; IT JUST GAVE ME SHIVERS ALL OVER. THE ONLY TIME I FELT THAT WAY WAS WHEN I SAW ANNIE. DO YOU KNOW ANNIE? IT'S STILL PLAYING, I UNDERSTAND. SILLY. YOU LOOK VERY SILLY. I WAS GONNA SAY I LOOK LESS LIKE-- AN IDIOT. &quot;GET YE TO THE DECK AND GRAB THE WHEEL!&quot; &quot;AYE, AYE, CAPTAIN.&quot; WHICH, UH, IS A DRAMA TECHNIQUE THAT TOLD ME THAT HE WAS THE CAPTAIN. SO RIGHT THERE WE KNEW THE RELATIONSHIP. FIRST MATE AND CAPTAIN. I FOUND IT BRILLIANT. YOU SHOULD'VE BROUGHT THE KIDS ALONG. THEY'D HAVE SO MUCH FUN PLAYING WITH BUSBY. &quot;BUSBY, YOU'RE PULLING ON JOBEEN. DINNER.&quot; &quot;OH, OH, HUNGRY!&quot; IT MAKES ME FEEL SO OLD. YOU DON'T LOOK OLD, DARIEN. YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL. HEY, HANDSOME. THAT'S--IT'S JUST THE COSTUME. OOH! LOOK AT WHAT WE GOT HERE. [LAUGHS] HEY! HEY! JEEZ! CUT IT OUT, DIANE. I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. DIANE! IT'S SUCH A GREAT IDEA. Travis: HEY! HEY, BUDDY. YOU, UH, LOOKIN' FOR ME? SURE. WHY NOT? YEAH. HEY, I APOLOGIZE. I HAVEN'T BEEN VERY SOCIAL TONIGHT, BUT I'M KIND OF HIDING OUT. I THINK IT'S GOOD YOU'RE HIDING OUT. PEOPLE ARE PRETTY UNCOMFORTABLE HAVING YOU HERE. YEAH. WELL, SCREW 'EM, RIGHT? RIGHT? WE CAN STAY HERE. IT'S LIKE THAT OTHER PARTY'S NOT EVEN GOING ON OUT THERE. OH, NO, NO. IT'S GOING ON. TRAVIS, DON'T KID YOURSELF. PEOPLE ARE IN THE LIVING ROOM. YOU'RE IN A CLOSET. WELL, IT'S OUR TOUGH LUCK, HUH? HEY, GO GRAB A CHAIR. AND DO WHAT WITH IT? SADDLE UP TO THE BAR. WHAT, ARE WE GONNA DRINK IN SHIFTS IN HERE? YEAH, RIGHT. SO, UH, RAE DAWN CHONG, HUH? HMM? YOU BROUGHT RAE DAWN CHONG TO THE PARTY. OH, YEAH.
