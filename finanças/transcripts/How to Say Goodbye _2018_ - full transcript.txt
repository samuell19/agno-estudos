Dad? Where's your packing tape? Jesus, Claire, how did you get in here? I have your spare key, remember? Oh. Just a minute. What is all this stuff? The prop designer quit so I have to figure out a way to make a giant Venus flytrap. I think you should stick with directing. Yeah, or acting, but nobody wants to hire me for that anymore, oh boy. So you're gonna do this, huh? I'm gonna do it. Let me get to that packing tape. Dad? Do you think I'm too old to be starting an acting career? Absolutely not, but I'll tell you what a guy once said to me. If you can make a living any other way, do that. I'm gonna make you proud. You already have. - No, no. - No, I fucking called you. I don't care what she told you. - Tim, come on. - No, fuck. Well, call him back right now and say we're gonna get on the phone with him. - No, that's not cutting it. - It spreads flatter. - No, no, no. - Back 35. - Back 30. - I can't do better than 30. Listen, I'm gonna start you over. Today I have a brand new stock for you to make 5000 on. It's gone up a little bit, but I can guarantee you'll make at least... Come on, man, where you going, come on, come back to the phone. Do we get paid? - I'll Lyft you. - I'll offer out. What? Goddammit, all right, treat me subject. Fuck. Hey, I'm sorry, we lost it. - 500. - Say 200 more! We didn't have a good day today. What happened? No one wants to do anything. Most guys on the sidelines with all the volatility. Fed's on a roll. Tom, with this rate, we're gonna have to shut your operation down. I think it's a cyclical thing. I wouldn't worry too much just yet. You have a negative carryover from last year. I know. I just need a couple of big trades to cover that. Are you taking out the younger clients? Yeah, I mean I'm on 'em. Keep plugging away, I guess. Okay. Is something else bothering you? No. Just was my brother's birthday, so. Oh, I'm sorry. Hey, where are you going? Oh, I have to go. Why? I work. Do you want some coffee? I don't drink coffee. Can't you stay a little longer? I have an important meeting. I thought we were having lunch. Can we take a rain check? Come on, stay a bit? I can't, it was really nice meeting you, Carol. - Chloe. - That's what I meant. - Do you have my number? - Yes. What is it? I have in my phone. It's, yeah, I don't have it. Here, call me. Bye. Hi, it's me, are we still on for tonight? Good, I'll see you at six. I have a completely new paradigm on life. I am so so inspired intellectually, philosophically and sexually. What's a paradigm? You have beautiful hair, Justine. Thank you. You have to live the moment. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Don't plan, don't plan a thing, just do. That's my motto, like that Nike commercial. Just do it, you mean? Let's go away you weekend, you and me, wherever you wanna go, St. Bart's, Paris. Mario, I have a photo shoot. No, no photo shoot, that's work. We have to live. But I'm sorry, I don't think of you like that. Mario? Paige. What are you doing here? Paige. How are you? Why are you still in New York? I thought you were going to London. I was, but something came up. Hi, I'm Justine. Paige, Justine, Justine, Paige. What is going on? Look, I just needed some time to think over my life, okay, I was going to tell you. The whole thing was a lie, wasn't it? Why is this happening to me? - What the fuck are you doing? - Why are you so upset, honey? Have a drink. I am breaking up with you, you motherfucker. I hate you. As you can see, it gets plenty of natural light and of course you won't have to worry about furniture. How many square feet did you say this was again? Well, we measure from the outside, so it's 250 square feet but I'd say it's about 200 square feet of livable space. I see. Oh, right, I forgot to tell you the AC is broken, but you can just pick up a new on at PC Richards for, like, $200, any other questions? No, I love it. And the men's shirts go here, stacked just like this. Got it. I got to admit, I can't stop flirting with all the good looking guys that come in here. This city is full of 'em, anyways, I'm going on my lunch break now. I'll show you the stockroom when I get back. Okay great, hi! Hi, I'd like to return this belt. Okay, no problem, not the right fit? Well, actually I was gonna use it as a whip on my date, but I never got around to it. Sure, if I could just have your credit card. - I'm a little nuts. - Not judging. Thank you. Paige, that bitch, I thought she never goes to that joint. Murphy's Law. She stormed out of there. What are you gonna do? Tell her I needed to spend some time with you and figure some shit out, so I canceled the trip to London. You expect her to believe that? Yeah, girls believe anything they wanna believe. Like Justine, that vixen, she won't fuck me. She's giving me that friendship vibe. I met this Danish chick at the Amsterdam airport. Off the hook, got her to visit me. What do you got? Nothing. This city fucks with your head, you know? We'd be married by now if we were living in Boise, Idaho. So many chicks in New York. It's like this. You walk into Barney's to buy a suit. And you can't choose 'cause there's so many fucking nice suits. You're picky because you think you should be picky. You try one on and you kinda like it but you don't buy it because you want to keep looking. What I do is I just buy up all the suits I can and then return them all. Aren't you gonna run out of suits? No, you never run out of suits, this is New York City. How's your work? It's falling apart, I can't seem to get anything going. You got to meet this Kyle guy, he's a big fixed income dude at Phonics. - Street? - Buy side. I can't do business with him, it's company policy. Well, meet with him at least, he'll give you some color. He's having a fundraiser next week. You got to dress up though, it's a formal. All right. You see that brunette at my one o'clock? I think I'm getting a vibe from her. - No. - Yes. She's not looking over. Let's go talk to them. Friend's cute, sold to you, not a good cashflow. So I met him on Tinder. He seemed totally normal, he had a good job, close to his family and then a month later, he ghosted me, not a word. What's good to drink here? We're drinking Merlot. Merlot, if anybody orders a Merlot, I'm leaving, I'm not fucking drinking Merlot. You know that line from Sideways? Yeah, yeah, good one, that's a good movie. Three Merlots. If you don't mind my saying so, the whole idea is dangerous and ludicrous. The whole id... The whole idea is... Nope, Henrietta, don't hang up. Oh my God, let me explain, Henri... Everything okay? How's things? Work's good. We're designing a new building in Brooklyn. Awesome. But Henrietta and I broke up. Just now? Two weeks ago, I broke up with her. I thought you were in love with her. You don't know what it's like to wake up to the same minutia over and over again. Six months ago you were sad and lonely. You're one to talk. How long have you been sad and lonely for? Three years? Things didn't work out with Isabella because she had to move to Europe. I tried. Well, you kinda just mope around here. It's like, I don't know, like you're stuck. My business is going down the tubes. I don't have time for anything else. Tom, you're miserable. You're killing yourself, I mean, look, you've done well and your brother would be really proud. I'm not gonna let what he built crumble like this, okay? I just want you to be happy. Yeah, well. You have to stop being so antisocial. Okay. How's your friend Mario? I never got to meet him last year at the Christmas party. Yeah, you'll like him, he's crazy. Maybe I should date men. Really? I can buy the fours and sell the four and a halfs for 22. 15, I can't hit that, bro. There's no money in it. I already passed on 17. I don't have anything else. Okay. I'll talk to you tomorrow. Hey Peter, I got to go to this thing. - Can you check out? - Sure. Hey Simone, it's Tom, where can I get a bow tie near me? Well, I had one but the clip part thing broke off. Yeah, okay, okay, thanks. - We're closed. - No. We open again tomorrow at 10. But you sell bow ties, yes? We do but not right now. Try Bloomingdale's. That's too far, I have this work function in an hour, please? Look, I would help you, but I'm running late for an appointment myself. Can I just grab one of those? I'll take five minutes of your time. Please, it's really important. Okay. Something like this? - Do you have a clip-on? - We don't. I don't know how to tie this, can you show me? I'm gonna be really late for this audition. Okay, okay, I'll figure it out. - Credit card? - Yes. What's the audition for? - An independent film. - Nice, exciting. Yeah, I'm nervous, it's my first one. Oh really? Yeah, I just moved here a week ago. - Where from? - Pennsylvania. You know what, come with me. Cross that over the top, pull it under, pull it back nice and tight, throw it over your right shoulder, - just watch for now. - Sorry. You're gonna make your little bow like that. You think you got it? Yeah, I got it, I got it, I got it. Okay. - Can I give you a ride? - No, I got to go. Hey, your keys! Hi, I'm here for the audition. They left, you just missed them. I knew it, can you just read with me and record the scene? No, they took the equipment. Here, here here here, use my phone. You can email her the video. No, I'm not gonna use your iPhone, that's not even allowed. Are they gonna be back tomorrow? No, today was the last day. I think the party's over, my man. There's no more cheap paper. Buy side's losing money, investors are pulling out, it is not what it used to be, hey Burt. You don't think the rate hikes are gonna help? People are moving to different products. You're looking at junk bonds and emerging markets for the next five years, ugh. Yeah, I don't know anybody in those sectors unfortunately. Tell you what, I'll introduce you to Gary. He's insane, but if you can keep up with him, you have a shot. I really appreciate that, Kyle, thank you. Hey, who's the best quarterback ever? - Tom Brady. - Get the fuck outta here. - He's got five rings, bro. - What kind of New Yorker - are you? - How 'bout Terry Bradshaw? Steelers, ah, yeah. Round of shots, fellas, let's go. - Yeah. - My wife says I can stay out late tonight. When the wife says go for a touchdown, you go for the touchdown, right? I got to tell you guys something, New York is dead. Vegas is where is it, baby, Vegas. - Vegas. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. You are a sight for sore eyes. Oh, sorry I'm late. You, I love everything you got going on. Can we sit? Oh. You are absolutely ravishing. Are you always this complimentary? Only when I'm inspired. Here, try this risotto. It is amazing. - Mmm. - Right? - Mmm, delicious. - Right? I love your hair. I'm a hair guy. I just washed it. You don't know what you're doing to me. What am I doing to you? There are a few things in my daily life that I can say are amazing, like this risotto, but in the rare moment when something is more than amazing like a '98 Chateau Morgeaux or an '85 Sasicaya, I call that sublime. Really. Do you know what else is sublime? You. You are sublime. Get on your back. I bet your ass tastes better than mountain butter. - What? - Nothing. Oh, you're dirty. I could show you 15 and a half bid, Rob. 16 and four offers repeating, Jerry. 15 and 28 bid now and I'm running out of room. I think it's a very good bid, Rob, Rob? What, come on bro, let's print this, we've worked on this a lot. Jerry, can you come up at all? What? Hey, I'm sorry, we lost it. No, I wasn't trying to fuck you, I lost out too, he shopped us, what? Can I help you? I'm just browsing. We have this fine shirt from Maison Juke. Oh, my, that looks fabulous on you. No. We have some other very nice things. Hi, I was here the other night, you dropped... Sorry, I'm helping another customer. - Do you work out? - Excuse me? - You have broad shoulders. - Okay. What size are you? Hey, I have your keys. Oh my God, you have my keys, where did you find them? You dropped them, you dropped them on your way out. Dammit, it cost me $100 to get into my own apartment. I looked for you, but you took off so fast. Well, I didn't want to miss my audition. - Well, how'd it go? - Didn't make it. Oh Jesus, I'm sorry, my fault. - Well, yeah. - I'm really sorry. I'm sure there will be plenty more. I'd like to make it up to you. Are you casting for a feature film? Yeah, right, I know you're new to town. - Are you a foodie? - Nope. Do you like operas? Aren't you off this weekend, Claire? Seema? I could get Met tickets for you. - No opera. - Have you been to... How 'bout salsa dance? - Salsa dancing? - That sounds lovely. I don't dance. You wanna dance? No, thank you. - Come on, Papi. - No no, My girlfriend, I'm waiting for my girlfriend. - We're just dancing. - She gets really jealous. You look very uncomfortable. I think I pulled a neck muscle at the gym, very sore. So you're not gonna dance with me? I can barely bring my arm up. I think I should just take it easy. - I saw you chug that drink. - That was my right arm. - It's really easy. - No. - No, seriously? - I'm really bad. - I will show you. - It's okay. It's fun watching you. Might I remind you that you made me miss my audition? All right, fine, don't laugh. I won't laugh. Try to relax. It's just that, when I was in college, my best buddy he made fun of me, I think I was dancing to New Order. He said that I looked like I was having a seizure. What a jerk. Well, he's probably right. Don't let go. You should have seen yourself, you looked petrified. - No. - You did. - That was a walk in the park. - Let's do it again next week. - I don't think so. - Chicken. Welcome to New York. Hopefully soon you'll be saying break a leg. Yeah, how'd you get into acting? I grew up around it, my dad was a struggling actor. And I don't know, maybe I'm kidding myself. - Don't say that. - I think I waited too long. It's never too late, but you should've moved to New York sooner, maybe? - I couldn't. - Why not? I was engaged. Oh. Yeah. I was gonna be a high school drama teacher, actually, and my fiance, he was in the Navy and he didn't make it back from Afghanistan. - I'm so sorry. - It's okay. We were gonna buy a house near Penn State so he could get his MBA when he got out. - What was his name? - Jared. Thank you for your service. - I didn't mean to. - No, I... I lost my brother on 9/11. - Oh, wow. - Yeah. What a crazy world. God, it was a crazy day. I remember exactly where I was. I remember the night before. We had just come back from a road trip and I was parking the car. He was waiting for me and he was standing there and he smiled at me, in a way that he had never smiled before. I'll never forget that. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. - What was his name? - Dan, Danny. - What did he do? - He was a bond broker. - Isn't that what you did? - I took over his business. I needed a job, my parents were financially dependent on us at the time, but. I was gonna be a writer, I was working on my master's at NYU. So you never finished? Do you ever think about going back? I thought about night school, but just too busy. What? You're not a bad guy. Thank you for dinner. And for attempting to dance. Welcome. Do you want to go biking next weekend? Are you asking me out, Tom? I just thought I'd be your friend. I heard a lot of guys in New York were afraid of being rejected with their big egos. I'm not afraid of rejection, I'm afraid of, yeah. What are you afraid of? Nothing. You are gonna be my first guy friend in New York. There you go. - Night. - Good night. Mr. Heeney's office? Just a moment. Mario, there's a Jill on line one. Who? Hello, what is your last name? She says her name is Jill Hansen. Tell her I'm out of the office, - I'm out of town for business. - Sure. Hello, Miss Hansen, Mr. Haney is out of the office. Simone. Oh my God, Nicole, you can't do this. I just wanna spend some quality time with you. Is that so bad? What? - Yes. - No one has to know. You're the one who's getting married. I don't know anymore, I may just need to think about that. Well, don't not get married on account of me. I love you. Jesus, Nicole, you barely know me. We worked together for five months. This is getting really weird, the way you're stalking me. I feel you understand me, I really cherished our time together. You're just confused. - I wanna make love to you. - Nicole, no. - Why not? - First of all, I am not gonna be your bicurious guinea pig. Second of all, I'm trying to figure my own shit out, okay? - You're not attracted to me? - No, yes, that's not the point. Just once, please? I think I'm making a big mistake marrying Victor. Well, I can't help you with that. Hey, please? Do you have a strap on? - Strap on? - A dildo, a strap on dildo. No. It's not a race! It's not a race! It's nice out here. Yeah. Do you think you could swim across to the other side? I don't know, is it about a mile? I think so. I'm a wicked back stroker, so probably. I wish I were a better swimmer. It takes practice. Would you try and save me if I were drowning? I don't know, Tom, I don't know how good of friends we are just yet. Fair enough. What's with the orange bike? My ex wanted a colorful pair, so now I'm just stuck with this one. How long were you guys together? Two years, it was long distance. - Where? - Paris. - Wow. - Yeah, we Skyped a lot and really enjoyed that not being able to see each other feeling. So the distance killed it? I guess, who the hell knows? Were you in love with her? I guess. I was in love with Jared, just not in that desperate way, you know? We were together for a long time. So you said you're not afraid of being rejected. What? After dinner the other night. Oh, yeah, no, I mean, no. So what are you afraid of? Nothing, I'm pretty sure we're all gonna die. Don't sugarcoat it. That's one way of looking at it. Why be afraid of anything? It'll all be over soon. But I mean, you lose people love, I guess it makes you clam up. And you don't like opening up, do you? Well, we've come to the end of the road. - It's a nice ending. - Had a nice time. Me too, thanks for everything. You're welcome. So you're gonna catch the C train? Yep. I guess I'll see you later. Hey, Simone. I'm not sure what I should be getting. What's the problem? Well, there's a lot of stuff. Well, then, get a bunch of stuff. But I don't... Get the harness kit. - The harness kit? - Yes, the harness kit. Could I help you? No. - What are you doing? - Sorry. You don't have to do that. Okay. So is this what you've been fantasizing about? Yes. There's no turning back. No. Eloquent. Fuck, fuck you! Fuck! What do you have for me? I can generate some momentum with a couple of buy side guys. Tom, you know there's a hard wall between retail and street brokers. Historically, I understand that that's true, but small shops have weak sales coverage and there's where I can make a difference. If even one client makes a stink about it, I got to deal with the consequences. I would only work with guys that don't have a problem with it. I know you'd do the right thing. It's about perception, I can't risk it. Then how do you expect me to prop this up? You need to focus on the younger guys. I am doing, it's not about personality, it's about general lack of flow. I agree to disagree. Whatever it is, if you can't put up the numbers, I got to come up with some solutions. Is this seat taken? No, it's not taken. Mind if I sit down? No, go ahead. Mind if I, mind if I... Dammit. Hi, hey. Fine, how are you? I was just wondering if. Hi, come on in. I brought you wine. You didn't have to, but thank you. No big deal. - Bring your script? - Yeah. I appreciate you helping me. It's just hard not working off of someone, you know? No, yeah, anything for a struggling artist. What are you making? My specialty if you want to call it. Spaghetti a la Bologne. Yum, aren't you the master chef? I cook out of necessity. - Oh, wine? - Sure. Here's to... - It's good to see you. - It's good to see you too. Can I help? Yeah, sure, do you want to chop up some garlic? - Sure. - Oh, sorry. There you go. You know, I was gonna call you the other day after we biked, but I don't know, I just... No, I was gonna call you too, I just didn't know. No, it's okay. - Shall we? - Yes. You must be hungry. - I'm eating too fast. - A little bit. I hate it when that happens. It's a habit I picked up from work. I, um, we don't get lunch breaks, you know? Client calls, we have to drop everything we're doing. It's okay. I'm glad you're here. I'm glad to be here. - I'm reading the part of? - Jimmy. - And you're there. - Yep. - This is weird. - I know. So? It's about a vampire who wants to take over a sleepy town, you're at a bar minding your own business. Okay. - Is this seat taken? - No, it's not taken. Mind if I look at the menu? No, go ahead, do you know what time the sun sets today? - No, that's my line. - Sorry. Do you know what time the sun sets today? I'm not sure. Daylight is overrated, what do you do? I'm a writer, I am a writer, sorry. - You want a good story? - What do you have in mind? A vampire couple taking over this town. - Good one. - Okay, that was not in the script. - Yes it was. - All right. What is that? Oh. This was me freshman in college. - So young. - So dorky. Everyone's a dork at 18. Were you a dork at 18? Bad complexion, baby fat, glasses. Ouch. I was also in the marching band. That's sexy, you know? Maybe in Oklahoma. I'm sure you were as beautiful as you are now. That is the nicest compliment. Do you want another glass of wine? - No, thanks. - I'll get one. I think I should go. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I should go. Let me know how the audition goes. - I will, good night. - Night. So what happened? Nothing. But you like her. Yeah, I like her. Tom. Don't fuck this up. I didn't fuck anything up, I didn't do anything. That's what I meant. Just cool it. - Let me go talk to her. - Don't fucking talk to her. Don't fucking talk to her. Do you know what's going to happen? You are going to turn 60 and you are going to die alone. Don't get all dramatic, what about you, man? What do you got going on? - I fucked this chick. - Oh, you fucked this chick. You're making some incredible progress in your life. Okay, okay, it was stupid, it was nothing, but I am learning from my mistakes, you... You know what, I really don't wanna fight. Just let me go talk to her. No. Ah, the belt? Oh. No, that's our little secret, by the way. Mum's the word, what can I help you with? Well, actually, I'm going to this swanky event with my boyfriend and I need a fabulous new look. So something a bit more formal? Oh, oh, I think I like this. I love that one. Would you wear this for your boyfriend? Yeah, I mean, I'm not with anyone at the moment, but. No way, I don't believe you, you're so pretty. Thanks. I met a guy, but I don't think it's going to work out. Oh, that sucks. You're just not that into him. I am. But he's just very detached, you know? Oh, I know, believe me, I know. My boyfriend was the same way. New York City dudes are weird. Takes a while to get 'em out of their shell, but you know what, I don't think you should give up on him. Nice guys are hard to find, so many jerks out there. Yeah, maybe. Did you want to try that on? Oh, yeah, sure. Here's what I can do for you. There's gonna be an opening in client relations. I want you to consider it. Client relations? That's part of my job. This is at the corporate level. Strategic planning advice, things of that nature. Aren't we a management consulting firm? Tom, I'm trying to help you. I'm not qualified, nor am I interested in telling clients how to run their business, okay? Well, we may have to make some changes. You're gonna replace me. I have to keep that option open. What do you think's gonna happen? You bring in a new person and suddenly revenue's gonna start pouring in? Hey, I have my responsibilities. Just tell me one thing, have I done a good job for you - in the past 16 years? - You have. Then why would you trust that some other guy with less experience is gonna be able to run this thing better? Look, the business is changing. Younger traders are running the show. No one knows this product better than I do. This isn't personal. I don't know how else to take it. Okay, let's figure this out, how do we get you back on track? I could talk to the regionals, but that's just adding another step to get to the same spot. But it's another counter party. I don't need another counter party, I need more flow. Okay. - Hi. - Hey, good news? - I got the part. - That's great! Break a leg! Claire, this is Mario. Tom didn't mention you're beautiful. - He didn't, so unkind. - Really. All right, knock it off, do you guys want a drink or what? Get three Merlots. I have a beautiful villa in Tuscany. I wish you could see it. It's 600 years old and the stones that they used to build this house date back to the Roman Empire, - can you believe it? - Really? I built this outdoor oven, I make my own pizza. Do you like pizza? I love pizza. You know, I serve on the board of an off Broadway theater company. Which one? The Pine or Pearl Theater, it's been so long that I forget Well, it's important for me to be networking. I got to get out there and meet people in the industry. Take my number down, we should hang out. Oh, sorry, I have to take this call, excuse me. Ooh. You're not together, are you? No. Mind if I try to get in there? Mario, you know I don't mind, but just don't go there unless you're serious. Well, in that case, forget it. Why do you have to treat every girl like it's a transaction? Because it is a transaction, everything is a transaction. There's a bid and an offer, it takes two to make a market, it takes two to tango, what's your problem? All you see is a piece of meat. You know they have feelings, hopes and dreams, but you don't give a fuck. Yeah, well, I have hopes and dreams too. I'm lining up for happiness just like everybody else. Maybe all they see is dollar signs and my incredible charm, who are you to judge? I'll stop judging once you stop using people like they're a fucking commodity. Everybody uses everybody, what, are you fucking naive? You know what your problem is? You're too chickenshit to do anything about it. Why did you storm off like that? I thought I'd give you and Mario some privacy. That is not fair. I said we're friends, so we're friends. You don't have to look to me for approval. What is wrong with you, why are you acting this way? Claire, what do you want from me? Why can't you admit that you have feelings for me? Because I don't. You can lie to me, Tom, but don't lie to yourself. Are you so afraid of being hurt that you will never allow yourself to be happy? I'm just fine, thank you. You are not fine, I can see that you're not fine. You put up this facade like you don't give a shit about anything, look, I have done that and it is not fun and there is no place to go from there. We both have suffered life altering losses, but that does not mean that we have to spend the rest of our lives being numb. Would you like a knish or a pretzel or a hot dog, maybe? Hot dog? Okay, hot dog. Could we get two hot dogs, please? Ah. Oh my God, you have so much mustard on your mouth. Oh shit, napkin. Here. Thank you. I feel like a tourist in my own city. I know, it is so gorgeous, though. Right? When I was a kid, I used to eat my ice cream really fast. Shocker. Then I'd convince my little brother that he couldn't finish his before it started to melt. You should've seen the look on his face. - He'd hand it over to me. - You are so mean. You're not eating yours fast enough. - Stop. - It's gonna start melting. You're gonna get it all over your hand. No I won't. You can't finish it, give it to me. Stop it! - Let's take a selfie. - Okay. Is there noodle soup in Korean cuisine? Yes. How 'bout Thai? I'm not sure, I don't think so. Vietnamese? What, just because I'm Asian you think I'm an expert in noodle soup? Yes. Vietnamese, definitely, they have the best noodle soup. Japan? Oh, Japan, udon come from Japan. All right, all right. - Claire? - Yeah? Nothing. What should we do after dinner? Let's go dancing. No. - You're laughing at me. - I am not laughing at you. - You're laughing at me! - Now I am! To summarize, there are many challenges and opportunities in the world of architecture today and our creative decisions will impact not only aesthetics but also the environment in which we live, thank you. Are there any questions? It looks like you have a question. Oh, no, no, no question. Okay, well, thanks for coming. It really did look like you had a question. No, no, I'm a developer and I agreed with everything you said. Do you want to get a drink? Yeah, sure, yeah. You, you're an Adonis. Sounds like you're teasing me. - Oh, I am teasing you. - Yeah. - You work out, don't you? - I do my thing. - Oh, I bet. - Are you all right? I'll let you know in an hour. Oh, okay, so do you want to talk about your blueprint? Oh, don't be so boring, Derek. - Let's get another. - Yeah. Bartender. I know just what to do with you. - Really. - Yeah. And I have to tell you that I don't like - anything complicated. - Shh, don't speak. Don't speak. Totally engaging. We spend the rest of the night drinking and this is where I fucked up, I invite him back to my place and crazy mad sex. - Simone. - We did it like three times. So he calls me up the next day and asks me out and I want to look good, you know, I have Pauline come over and she's doing my hair for like an hour and a half, makeup, the whole works. I get a phone call at five PM. He says "I'm really sorry but something came up at work" "and I can't make it," I mean what the fuck, what the fuck? So he says, "Can we meet tomorrow for lunch" "or dinner Thursday," and I'm like, "I can't, "because I am busy" and he wasn't even that apologetic. Stop, hold on, you had a one night stand with this guy, what do you expect? Yeah, but he was all over me. I could tell that he was into me. I know what this is about. - What, I need validation? - You need to grow up. Just stop it. Why did you break up with Henrietta? I told you, she was getting on my nerves. That's just people, man, like sometimes people are annoying. I find some fault and I just can't let it go. I just get fixated on it, you know? Yeah, the thing is, you're not perfect. Yes I am, I'm perfect. Okay. So how are things with Claire? - Good. - Oh come on. What? I can tell you're in love with her. See, see? You smiled just at the thought of her name. How long am I supposed to wait for something to happen? I haven't even had an audition in two months. I wish I could tell you. All I do is work at the store. Just be patient. - Okay, I love you, Dad. - Love you too, hon. Bye. - Hello? - Hi, this is Peter. Did Tom leave for work? Oh, I see, okay, they're vacating a spot today and I wanted to give him a heads up before he got in. Never mind, he's walking in now. Shawn wants to see you. Sharon, hi, I'm well. It's slow, really, oh my God, that's amazing. Who is it? Wow, I had a good feeling also. No, nothing at the moment. - Really? - Who is it? I mean, yes, I mean, it would be a wonderful opportunity. Okay, I will, I'll get back to you. Congratulations, bye. Who is that? Sharon, the producer. - They're offering me a role. - That's awesome! They found a theater company in London. London. They're interested in a year long run. It's an amazing opportunity, I mean, the exposure could be really good for me - if the show is a success. - Of course, absolutely. I mean, obviously I would rather be here, but I'm not getting anything. I mean, it takes time. So you don't think I should take the job. I didn't say that, I mean, it's your decision. I would like to think it is our decision. A year's a long time, Claire. We could see each other, I don't know, twice a month. You'd come visit me. Yeah, on the weekends and Skype the rest of the time and have a virtual relationship. So what are you saying? We don't have to talk about this now. Well, it's too late. Just saying, let's be realistic. What the hell is that supposed to mean? We're gonna be an ocean apart. Are you saying that we can't be together if I go to London? - It's not up to me. - Well, who's it up to? I just got the best news of my career and I am so sad right now. No one cares about this for you more than I do. You're acting like a real jerk, you know that? Like you don't give a fuck about me. I care about you more than anything in this world and if you don't know that, I don't know what to tell you. You have to go, just don't expect me to like it. I won't go, okay? I said I won't take the job. You have to go. I'll join Actors Equity and maybe I can book a Broadway gig. Last time I checked, they don't just hire anybody. What do you know about theater? I know enough. There's a lot of TV in New York now. I haven't booked any of it because maybe I didn't, I don't know, maybe I need a TV agent. A TV agent? Yeah, some of them specialize more in TV than film and theater, work with me here. I love you. You have to go. And I want to make this work. So what are we talking about here? Rehearsals start in two weeks. Where would you live? The producers said they'd find me a studio. - I want you to be safe. - Babe, it's London. It says it's 45 degrees and raining. - It's to be expected. - You're gonna need a raincoat - I'll get one. - Oh, let's get one together before you go. Okay. I shouldn't have deleted my Skype account. We'll open new ones together. Yeah. I'm gonna miss you, goddammit. I'm all right, I'm all right. I'm gonna miss you too. What do you think? Another martini for the birthday boy? Yes please. - I won't. - No, you can't leave again. - No, I'm not. - Okay, well, was it fun? Not without you, I got you. You are so cute. There you go, is there anything else I can get for you in the meantime? No, this is, this is perfect. - Andreas? - Yes sir. - Are you a family man? - Yes sir. I have a wife and two kids. The gods have blessed you. Thank you, sir. The gods have blessed me too. I am successful in my work, I have amassed great wealth, but the gods have not shown much favor in love. They will, sir, they will in time. Thank you, Andreas, thank you. You're welcome, sir. - When's boarding? - It's at eight. I'm sorry I can't take you to the airport. It's okay. The first session's mandatory. We all have to show up. Don't worry about it. Did you get an aisle seat? I got a window. Aisle's better, no? I prefer a window. What about your apartment, how are you gonna get in? The super will be there. - Okay. - Tom. - Yeah? - Don't worry. I don't know how to say goodbye. - It's not goodbye. - I know. I love you. I love you too. Can you pass the salt, please? Oh, sure. Thank you. Aren't you Mario? Yes. Have we met? I'm Simone, I was at Tom's Christmas party last year. Oh, okay. - I really don't. - Yeah, you seemed kinda busy. Well, I was probably laying it on thick with some unsuspecting victim. It kinda seemed that way, yeah. But you know what, I have a completely new paradigm on life. Do tell. Let's just say I wasn't very kind to others or myself. Yeah well, I think I've got a leg up on you - in that department. - Really? Yeah. But I'm changing my ways. Cheers to that. This week, we're going to be talking about the essential elements of a story structure, starting with the premise, then discussing the central conflict and moral choices of the hero. We're going to work from Anton Chekhov's Uncle Vanya. When we talk about premise, we want to articulate in one sentence... Hey. Hey, I'm here. - Are you there? - Yes, I'm here. - Do you see me? - I see you. - I don't see you. - Oh, crap. My video's not on. - There you are. - Hi! Hi, sorry I'm so late. - That's okay. - What time is it over there? - It's 11:30. - Oh, it's really late. - You look good. - You look good. No, I don't, you look like a star. - You're so sweet. - I looked into flights. Oh, me too, there's a British Air leaving JFK Wednesdays - at nine PM. - That's the one I looked at also, but if I leave on a Tuesday, then we'll have almost the whole week together. Oh, now you're thinking. What do you want to do when you get here? - I don't care. - You wanna see Big Ben? - The touristy stuff? - I don't care as long as we're together. What do you think? Should we try on a different suit? No. This is perfect.
