"DEAR RICK, ALTHOUGH I'VE MET YOU BRIEFLY BEFORE, "I WAS TOO OVERCOME WITH EMOTION "TO TRULY EXPRESS HOW YOU'VE TOUCHED MY LIFE. IN MARCH OF '81..." Jay: MY PERCEPTION IS HE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF IT RIGHT AWAY. HE DEFINITELY BECAME MORE FOCUSED, QUITE QUICKLY. "I WAS JUST 13 YEARS OLD..." Rick: "I WAS JUST 13 YEARS OLD , AND I WAS TERRIFIED. THERE WERE NO GUARANTEES I'D MAKE IT THROUGH." Laurie: AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE PHOTOS, YOU CAN SEE THE PROGRESSION OF THE EMOTION ON RICK'S FACE. AS I GET INTO THE STORY, HE'S STANDING CLOSER, AND THEN HE'S GOT HIS ARM AROUND ME, AND THEN I'VE GOT MY HEAD ON HIS CHEST, AND THEN I'M CRYING, AND THEN HE'S CRYING, AND THEN WE'RE BOTH CRYING. "YOU HAVE SPOKEN TO ME, REACHED ME..." Rick: "YOU'VE SPOKEN TO ME , REACHED ME "IN A WAY NO ONE ELSE EVER COULD. "IN BOTH THE HARD TIMES AND GOOD TIMES OF MY LIFE, "I'VE ALWAYS COME BACK TO YOUR MUSIC AS MY EMOTIONAL RELEASE." Laurie: THAT'S ALL I NEEDED. THAT'S ALL I NEEDED WAS FOR HIM TO HEAR ME SAY, "THANKS." Rick: IT WAS REALLY GENUINE. I REALLY GOT THAT FROM THE SHORT MEETING. I THINK IT WAS LIKE 4:00 IN THE MORNING WHEN I FINALLY FELL ASLEEP 'CAUSE I WAS SO EXCITED, AND I WOKE UP AND I TURNED OVER AND I LOOKED AT MY HUSBAND, AND HE SAID, "HOW ARE YOU?" AND I SAID, "IT'S GONE." "WHAT DO YOU MEAN, 'IT'S GONE?"' THE FIRST THING I'M THINKING IS, LIKE, HER STUFF OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT... SHE SAYS, "NO." I SAID, "MY ANGER." I WOKE UP AND I PHYSICALLY FELT A LIGHTNESS IN MY BODY, LIKE I HAD LEFT MY ANGER AT THE SOUND CHECK. IT WAS REALLY EASY WITH HER. SHE HAS THIS GREAT ENERGY THAT I REALLY LIKE. I THINK THAT GOD WAS TIRED OF WAITING FOR ME TO GET THERE, AND I SOMEHOW IMAGINE THAT HE SAID, "OKAY, WELL, YOU HAVEN'T HEARD MY WHISPERS "AND YOU HAVEN'T HEARD MY SHOUTS, "SO I'M GONNA THROW A BRICK AT YOU "TO MAKE YOU REALLY PAY ATTENTION, "AND IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO HEAL. AND IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO LET GO." AND THAT BRICK WAS GETTING TO MEET RICK. I'M HONORED TO BE PART OF SOMEONE'S LIFE LIKE THAT. IF I COULD BE THAT PERSON ALL THE TIME, I'D PROBABLY BE A LOT HAPPIER. I WOULD BE A LOT HAPPIER.

THE NEXT DAY, SHE'S READY TO GO HOME, SHE'S HIGH AS A KITE, AND GO TO THE AIRPORT. RICK WAS AT THE AIRPORT AS WELL, AND I RAN INTO HIM AND WENT OVER AND SAID HELLO, AND HE TOLD ME THAT HE WAS ON THE FLIGHT THAT HAD BEEN DELAYED FOR FOUR HOURS AND THAT HE HAD BEEN THERE SINCE 6:30 THIS MORNING. I SAID I'M GONNA MISS MY SURROGATE MOM'S SERVICE, WHICH WAS A REALLY MEANINGFUL THING FOR ME TO GET TO. Davidson: RICK AND I HAVE BEEN FRIENDS SINCE THE MID-'70s. AND WHEN HE CAME HERE, IT WAS A RATHER BRAVE ENDEAVOR. I DON'T THINK HE KNEW ANYONE, REALLY. AND DOUG INTRODUCED ME TO HIS FAMILY, AND HIS MOM REALLY TOOK ME IN. SHE SAVED MY LIFE, FOR SURE, 'CAUSE SHE GAVE ME THAT FAMILY CONNECTION THAT I'D BEEN MISSING, AND SHE WAS VERY WARM AND A REAL NURTURER. Davidson: HE GOT TO KNOW AND LOVE MY MOM SO MUCH THAT SHE ACTUALLY BECAME HIS AMERICAN MOM. SHE WAS A GREAT LADY. [ CLEARS THROAT] SHE DIED ON MOTHER'S DAY, 2005. AND HER SERVICE WAS THAT... THAT DAY. AND I KNEW IF I GOT ON THIS PLANE IN TUCSON I'D MAKE IT BACK TO THE SERVICE JUST IN TIME. IF I WENT FROM THE AIRPORT TO THE... I'D JUST MAKE IT. AND THEY CANCELED THE FLIGHT. AND OUT OF MY MOUTH, WITH NO FORETHOUGHT WHATSOEVER, I JUST SAID, "RICK, YOU CAN HAVE OUR TICKETS." AND I SAID, "NO, NO, I CAN'T DO THAT." IT'S MY INITIAL REACTION WHEN I'M GIVEN THINGS IS TO SAY NO. I'M NOT GOOD WITH GIFTS OR COMPLIMENTS OR THINGS LIKE THAT, SO I SAID NO. I MANAGED TO CONVINCE THEM TO LET ME SWITCH OUR SEATS FOR HIS. SO I WENT BACK TO RICK, AND I HESITATED 'CAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE A PEST, I DIDN'T WANT TO BOTHER HIM. BUT I FINALLY GOT HIS ATTENTION, AND I SAID, "RICK, THEY SAID IT WAS OKAY. YOU CAN HAVE OUR TICKETS." AND HE STARTED TO CRY. THAT WAS AN AMAZING, ABOVE-THE-NORM KIND OF GIFT, AND... I'll NEVER FORGET STUFF LIKE THAT. AND SO SHE SWITCHED RICK'S TICKET AND MY HUSBAND'S TICKET, AND THEN SHE ASKED RICK, "WELL, WHO'S THE OTHER PERSON THAT'S FLYING?" AND HE SAID, UM, "NO, WE'RE ONLY EXCHANGING ONE TICKET. LAURIE'S FLYING HOME WITH ME." I SHOOK HIS HAND AND I SAID, "I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT." IT WAS ACTUALLY A VERY SWEET GESTURE ON HIS PART, TO, YOU KNOW, WISH HER HAPPY ANNIVERSARY AND SAID, "GO FLY," YOU KNOW. AND SO I TURNED TO MY HUSBAND, AND I SAID, "I LOVE YOU," AND I GOT ON THE PLANE WITH RICK SPRINGFIELD. AND I SAT NEXT TO RICK SPRINGFIELD FOR AN HOUR AND TEN MINUTES. [ SNIFFLES ] I WAS VERY THANKFUL, 'CAUSE I GOT OFF THE PLANE AND JUMPED IN A CAR AND MADE IT JUST AS THE SERVICE WAS STARTING. SO IT WAS DEFINITELY MEANT TO BE, YOU KNOW, AND I WAS BEING... I THINK CORRINE WAS DOING A LITTLE SHUFFLING, TOO, BEHIND THE SCENES, AS WELL AS LAURIE WAS. HE GAVE ME A HUG AND HE SAID, "HOW CAN I EVER THANK YOU ENOUGH?" HOW CAN HE THANK ME? [ SNIFFLES ] AND SO, FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS THIS MONTH, HE HAS CALLED ME HIS "AIRPLANE GIRL" EVERY TIME HE SEES ME. I WEAR A PIN WHEN I GO TO CONCERTS, AND WE HAVE THIS AMAZING, SPECIAL BOND. [Voice breaking ] HE WAS THERE FOR ME IN MY LIFE WHEN I NEEDED A FRIEND. AND I WAS THERE FOR HIM AT THE AIRPORT WHEN HE NEEDED A FRIEND. THAT LOOKS REALLY GOOD. YEAH. Mike: YEAH I'VE HEARD , SO MUCH ABOUT HIM, SO MANY CHARITABLE THINGS THAT HE'S DONE, SO MANY SWEET THINGS, AND, YOU KNOW, I HAVE A FEELING THAT A LOT OF IT IS, UM, YOU KNOW, BUILT UP FROM THIS, YOU KNOW, FEMALE FAN BASE THAT IDOLIZED HIM FROM A YOUNG AGE, AND THEY ONLY SEE THE GOOD, AND I'M MORE OF THE SKEPTIC, AND I KNOW THAT HE'S A ROCK 'N' ROLL STAR, SO I TAKE EVERYTHING WITH A GRAIN OF SALT WHEN I HEAR THIS STUFF ABOUT HIM. THAT'S WHY I'D KIND OF LIKE TO MEET HIM AND SIZE HIM UP, GET A REAL FEEL FOR WHAT'S GOING ON THERE. IS THIS GUY REALLY ALTRUISTIC AS HE SEEMS TO BE, OR IS HE A SCUMBAG ROCK STAR JUST PUTTING ON A FACE? [THUNDER CRASHES ] Tom: IT IS A BIT OF A STRAIN ON A RELATIONSHIP. IT'S 24-7, PRACTICALLY. I MEAN, SHE WAKES UP, AND IT'S RICK-RICK-RICK UNTIL SHE GOES TO BED. BUT I THINK NOW AT THIS POINT IN HER LIFE, FINDING THESE FRIENDS TO GO THROUGH THAT JOURNEY TOGETHER, ESPECIALLY SUE, TO HOLD HER HAND THROUGH IT IS AMAZING. NO, I GET THE CAMARADERIE. I GET THAT IT'S AWAY FROM THE CHILDREN AND FROM THE FAMILY AND JUST A LITTLE VACATION TIME. THE ISSUE ISN'T JUST WHO'S GOING TO WATCH THE KIDS DURING THE DAY? IT'S WHEN I'M ON CALL, AND I'M ASLEEP WITH THREE CHILDREN AND I GET CALLED OUT, IS THERE SOMEBODY HERE TO WATCH THESE THREE LITTLE ONES? IT IS DIFFICULT, IN A SENSE, THAT I HAVE TO BECOME THAT MR. MOM AND STEP INTO THAT ROLE. I DON'T THINK THE CHILDREN MIND ALL THAT MUCH. AS LONG AS THEY'RE WITH MOMMY OR DADDY, THEY'RE FINE WITH IT. BUT LATELY THE KIDS BASICALLY GET THAT SHE'S AWAY A LOT BECAUSE OF HIM. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY SAY THIS ALL THE TIME, BUT THEY'LL JUST SAY, "DADDY, I HATE RICK. DO YOU HATE RICK, TOO?" I'll SAY "YES".' [ CHUCKLES ] Tom: I ENJOY SEEING HER HAPPY. I WISH I HAD SOMETHING THAT COULD BRING ME THAT KIND OF LEVEL OF JOY, UNITE ME WITH FRIENDS, UH, FROM ALL OVER. YOU KNOW, I WOULD DO ANYTHING TO BRING HER JOY. AND AS HER HUSBAND, THAT'S SOMETHING I LIKE TO DO, IS MAKE HER HAPPY. SO I'M GONNA SIZE THIS GUY UP TODAY. I THINK WE'RE THROUGH THE HEAVY STUFF RIGHT NOW, BUT I'M NOT SURE. YEAH, I THINK I'VE GOT HER PRETTY WELL FOOLED. SHE THINKS I'M AT WORK RIGHT NOW. WELL, THAT'S GOOD. GOOD WAY OUT THERE. I MEAN, HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW I'M GONNA REACT. I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GONNA LIKE HIM. I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GONNA BE A WISE ASS. I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GONNA BE PHYSICAL WITH HIM. LOOK AT MIKE! LOOK OUT, RICK. LET'S SEE HOW MUCH THIS BOY WEIGHS. I AM SO NOT HAPPY. WHAT WAS THAT? I'M MISERABLE! I CAN SEE HIM IN THERE. HE'S MOVING. YEAH, HE'S IN THERE! I CAN SEE HIM! OOH! HOW YOU DOIN'?

THEY'RE REGULAR PEOPLE, JUST... OVER-THE-TOP FANS. [ LAUGHS ] I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY CALL THEM... "THE RICKSTERS"? YOU KNOW, THEY'RE REALLY MOTIVATED. I SEE ALL THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE ROOMS, THEY'RE DECORATED, ALL THE ROOMS THE DOORS ARE DECORATED WITH THE PICTURES, WITH THE HUGGING, KISSING. Woman: THOSE ARE REALLY COOL. I THINK THEY'RE REALLY NEAT THAT ACTUALLY PEOPLE GO OUT AND PUT A LOT OF THOUGHT INTO SOME OF THE DOORS THAT ARE OUT THERE. IT LOOKED TOTALLY BIZARRE FOR ME. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WOULD MAKE SOMEONE WANT TO FOLLOW SOMEBODY LIKE THAT. PLUS THE EXPENSE OF DOING IT. I HAVE A HARD TIME EVEN GIVING MY FAMILY THE TIME THAT THEY DESERVE. UM, I CAN'T IMAGINE DEVOTING THAT MUCH TIME TO ANYTHING THAT'S LESS IMPORTANT, YOU KNOW, THAN MY FAMILY. I DON'T WANT TO SAY "CULT," BUT IT'S SORTA, KINDA LIKE THAT. IT'S LIKE, ARE THEY, LIKE... NOT BRAINWASHED, BUT... 'CAUSE THEY SEEM LIKE NORMAL PEOPLE, BUT THEY TALK ABOUT IT CONSTANTLY. AT THE BEACH PARTY, AFTER THE SHOW, RICK SAID, "EVERYBODY, LET'S GO INTO THE WATER." HE IS SKINNY, AND HE HAS LONG HAIR, AND HE'S HANDSOME, AND HE OPENS HIS ARMS TO RECEIVE HIS FANS, AND THESE WOMEN CROWD AROUND HIM, AND THAT MADE ME VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. THIS WAS A LOT MORE THAN JUST SEEING YOUR FAVORITE POP MUSICIAN. THIS WAS SOMEONE WHO IS FILLING A NEED FOR THESE PEOPLE. I GUESS I'D HAVE TO TALK TO MORE OF THE FANS TO FIGURE OUT WHY THEY ARE FOLLOWING HIM. I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. THERE MUST BE SOMETHING. I CAN'T IMAGINE MY LIFE WITHOUT HIM IN IT. I MEAN, I CAN'T. I'VE BEEN LUCKY IN THE FACT THAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO RUN INTO HIM A LOT AND HAVE PERSONAL INTERACTION WITH HIM QUITE A BIT, WHICH IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU GET FROM AN AVERAGE STAR. IT SEEMS LIKE YOU HAVE A DEPENDENCY ON THIS GUY. LIKE... AND THESE PEOPLE THAT... IT'S NOT A DEPENDENCY. HE FEELS THE SAME STUFF WE FEEL. HE'S JUST A GUY. I DON'T LOOK AT HIM ON A PEDESTAL ANYMORE. SO YOU CALL HIM, "HEY, RICK, HOW YOU DOING?" YEAH. HE REMEMBERS WHO I AM. THAT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I'M SOMEBODY. I MEAN, IT GOES REALLY DEEP. I CAN TELL. YOU'RE VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT IT. WHEN MY HUSBAND DIED, 2004... TO OPEN UP MY MAILBOX AND SEE A LETTER... MY E-MAIL BOX... AND SEE A LETTER FROM HIM SAYING, "I HEARD ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND... IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO?" OH, THAT'S NICE. [Voice breaking ] FOR ME, IT SAVED MY LIFE. IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S A RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE ALMOST, AND MOST PEOPLE, WHEN THEY GO THROUGH A TRAUMA LIKE DEATH OR A DIVORCE OR SOMETHING, THEY WILL TURN MORE TOWARD THEIR FAITH OR GOD. I USED HIS MUSIC AND HIS INSPIRATION WITHIN THE MUSIC TO PROPEL MYSELF INTO SOMETHING MORE THAN I THOUGHT I EVER COULD BE. NOW, I DON'T KNOW IF ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE LIKE THAT, BUT TO ME, THAT'S EXTREME. AND I THINK IT'S A BIT ODD. BUT IT HELPED HER, SO, HEY. THAT'S GOOD FOR HER. SHE NEEDS THAT TO GET THROUGH. SHE NEEDS HIM TO GET THROUGH HER LIFE. YEAH, THAT'S SCARY. BUT I THINK THAT IF THERE WAS A CRUISE LIKE THIS WITH JIMMY BUFFETT FANS? I DON'T KNOW... I THINK THAT WOULD BE A SCARY CRUISE TO BE ON.

SHAMELESS ADVERTISING. NO, I KNOW, I'M KIDDING. HEY, JOINING US IN STUDIO RIGHT NOW, RICK SPRINGFIELD. "LATE, LATE AT NIGHT" IS HIS BOOK.

SO, YOU SAY YOU KNEW ABOUT EVERYTHING IN THE BOOK, BUT DID YOU KNOW ABOUT HIS SUICIDE ATTEMPT? JoAnn: WE ACTUALLY DID, YEAH. I MEAN, WE KNEW ABOUT HIS INFIDELITY, HIS DEPRESSION, UM, THE SUICIDE ATTEMPT. I DIDN’T ACTUALLY... I DON'T KNOW IF YOU DID... BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THE TIMING OF IT. I DIDN'T REALIZE HE WAS THAT YOUNG. AND WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT DID HE DO AT 17? HE TRIED TO HANG HIMSELF. HE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A THOUGHT PROCESS. HE JUST RAN INTO HIS SHED, STOOD UP ON A CHAIR, TIED A KNOT, PUT IT AROUND HIS NECK, THREW IT OVER, AND JUST KICKED THE CHAIR OUT FROM UNDERNEATH HIM. I WAS FULL-ON COMMITTED. IT WASN'T LIKE TAKING FIVE SLEEPING PILLS INSTEAD OF 20 OR CUTTING A LITTLE BIT OF YOUR WRIST. I WAS FULL INTO IT AND COMMITTED TO IT. THE KNOT, YOU KNOW, IT UNTIED, AND HE HIT THE CONCRETE, AND THAT'S HOW HE WOKE HIMSELF UP. AND SOMETHING HAPPENED THAT WAS UNEXPECTED AND CHANGED MY LIFE. THERE IS A CHARACTER IN THE BOOK WHOM YOUR REFERENCE NAME IS "THE DARKNESS" THAT HAS TRAILED YOU THROUGHOUT YOUR LIFE. IN FACT, HE'S IN THIS ROOM WITH US NOW. I REFER TO HIM IN THE BOOK AS "THE DARKNESS," OR "MISTER D." I MADE HIM A THIRD PERSON, YOU KNOW, AS ANOTHER ENTITY SO I COULD DEAL WITH IT. AND HE SAYS SOME PRETTY DARK STUFF TO ME. YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE ANYTHING. IT'S GOT ITS GOOD SIDE AND ITS BAD SIDE. IT'S WRITTEN SOME PRETTY GOOD SONGS, YOU KNOW, AND IT'S BEEN PART OF MY DRIVE TO SUCCEED, BECAUSE I THOUGHT ALL THAT SUCCESS WOULD HEAL ME, WOULD BLOW AWAY THE DARK CLOUDS.

WHY DO WE HAVE ALL THESE COMMERCIALS ON TV WITH "THE LITTLE PURPLE PILL," "THE LITTLE BLUE PILL," "THE LITTLE YELLOW PILL," "THE LITTLE..." YOU KNOW, ALL THESE PILLS. LEARN MEDITATION, GET TO A THERAPIST TO TALK ABOUT WHAT IS IT THAT MAYBE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND? HE IS JUST TRYING TO TELL PEOPLE, "THIS IS MY JOURNEY, "AND IF ANY OF THIS CAN HELP YOU IN YOUR OWN WAY, IN YOUR OWN LIFE, THEN I'M SHARING." AND THAT'S WHAT HE'S DOING. Woman: PLEASE HAVE YOUR CAMERAS OUT AND READY! Woman #2: THEY'RE TRAPPED IN THE ELEVATOR. LET ME TRY. LET ME TRY. OKAY. "PUSH UP ON THIS POINT." OH, IT'S HERE. WE'RE FUCKED! WAIT...

Man: RICK SPRINGFIELD SIGNING HIS NEW BOOK, "LATE, LATE AT NIGHT." GUYS, STEP DOWN, PLEASE, STEP DOWN. WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE THAT NEED TO COME IN. I WANTED TO GIVE HIM THIS LETTER TO THANK HIM FOR ALL OF THE AWARENESS HE'S BROUGHT TO THE MEDIA ABOUT DEPRESSION AND SUICIDE. UM, I LOST MY MOM ONE YEAR AGO YESTERDAY. SHE TOOK HER LIFE, AND SHE TOOK ME TO MY FIRST RICK SPRINGFIELD CONCERT IN 1983 WHEN I WAS 10, WITH MY GIRLFRIEND, AND SHE LOVED HIM, TOO... SHE WOULD LISTEN TO HIM. I THINK MORE BECAUSE HE BROUGHT ME SO MUCH JOY, AND IT WAS JUST KIND OF LIKE TAKING ME TO MY HAPPY PLACE. SO, ANYWAY, JUST READING ABOUT HIS STRUGGLE WITH DEPRESSION AND KNOWING IT'S OKAY TO TALK ABOUT IT. I WANTED TO JUST THANK HIM. IF YOU COULD READ IT... YEAH. SURE I WILL. THANK YOU. Rev Dennis: I THINK THAT . HIM WRITING THE BOOK NOW IS PROBABLY JUST PERFECT. AND I DON'T HAVE TO APPROVE OF HIS LIFE. THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT HE DOES THAT I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THAT I THINK ARE SELF-DESTRUCTIVE. BUT IT'S OKAY, I CAN ACCEPT THAT. HE'S HUMAN, TOO.
