A SHOCHIKU FILM PORT OF FLOWERS Based on a Play by KAZUO KIKUTA Screenplay by YOSHIRO TSUJI Directed by KEISUKE KINOSHITA Cinematography by HIROSHI KUSUDA Starring EITARO OZAWA KEN UEHARA MITSUKO MITO CHISHU RYU Was Okano of the Seagull Inn the only one who returned from China as a success on this island? I thought I'd try hard there to save money and come home but the Japanese Association there ordered me to leave. They decided to send back unnecessary people first and observe the situation. Are they making that much of a fuss in the south? Yes. They say war might break out soon. This is really something. This time we might fight America and England. Setsuyo. Stop fooling around and help me with my work. How are your eyes? Still having trouble? Yes. That's too bad. Mr. Hayashida, the fishermen's boss, was complaining that they couldn't get a good catch because of your eyes. Hey, don't pull it too hard. You'll break the net. Hopeless. Mr. Kimura, I still wish I could watch the tides and currents. If you did, you'd go blind. I used to find the currents where skipjacks run and guide the boats to them. I can't get it out of my mind. I wish I could go to sea again. I wish I could go to the south again. Fooll What can you do there? I hate people who don't carry through with what they want. I told you I didn't want to come home yet. What? Stop it. It's no use. Father's always like this. Oharu. Hello. You look busy. My best to your brother. President! NOBADAMA STAGECOACH CO. How dirty! Dirty or not, I'm the boss. What brings you here? - The man who wired the Seagull Inn. - Yeah? - He wired again this morning. - Yeah? The village chief wants everybody at the inn. - Right now? - Yes. - Very well. - Please come. Where are you going now? The village office. Is my brother here? Chief, your sister's here. ISLAND VILLAGE OFFICE The man who wired the Seagull Inn yesterday — He's here already? No. The village chief wants you at the inn right away about it. I see. Also Setsuyo sends you her best again. SEAGULL INN What are you doing? Load it right or the fish will fall. That's it. Tell them to be sure to record those five extra boxes. Do you understand? Answer me! Yes, ma'am. - Answer me quickly. - Yes, ma'am. Okano. You're earning so much. Aren't you tired of money? What do you mean, Mr. Hayashida? You run the inn, sell fish, get stagecoach commissions. You're the fishermen's boss. You're the one who's rich. The richest two on this island envy each other? Were you summoned as well? The village chief's waiting. Is he? Madam, may I start the coach? You may, as soon as it's loaded. Brother and sister, but still a man and a woman. You shouldn't ride together. Oharu said it's urgent. She's to blame, too. I'm amazed you don't get a flat tire. “I arrive by ship tomorrow. Reserve a good room for me. I am Kensuke Watase, son of the late Kenzo Watase.” This telegram came from Nagasaki yesterday. And this morning's wire? “Will arrive by ship today. I'm eager to see the island for the first time. I am Kensuke Watase, the late Kenzo Watase's son.” They're almost the same. But today's was from Kagoshima. He meant to take a ship from Nagasaki but he left from Kagoshima instead. Why must he repeat “the late Kenzo Watase's son”? I suppose he wanted to make sure. The second telegram says “I'm eager to see the island for the first time.” Good! We know how he feels. It was 14 or 15 years ago that Mr. Watase started building a shipyard here. Back then, all the villagers were excited about building ships. But then the Depression came, which brought it all to an end. He was deeply depressed and left for the south. I guess he was the only one to think of such a big project here. Whatever they say, he was a hero. It's understandable that his son is eager to come here. I wonder how we should welcome him. We'll meet him at the port first. Right. He should be arriving any minute. As representatives of the village, we should all go. Hyah! As I recall, however, Mr. Watase had neither a wife nor children. Right. He was single at the time. Did he have children after he left? In my opinion, he was already married, but he came to this island by himself to build the shipyard. He was an odd type. Evidently. And there's something Okano knows best. What? It's a secret. Okano's kept it ever since. What are you saying? How about it? What's the story? Nothing for you! Okano fell for Mr. Watase once he left this island. Please, Mr. Hayashidal Let me talk. She followed him as far as Penang. That's quite a story, isn't it? It's an old story, Okano. It's time to tell us about it. If we had fallen in love, I'd be living in Penang or Singapore happily taking care of his grave. Then it's a tale of heartbreak for you? He wasn't interested in me at all. So I worked hard in Penang and came back home with the money I saved. Is that how it was? I still love him. I'm old now. All I can do is welcome his son sincerely. Excuse me. Are you Kensuke Watase? That's right. I'm Kensuke Watase. So you're Okano? I see. I came all the way from Tokyo to see where my father lived. I'm glad to see you. Father often told me about you. I'm overwhelmed, meeting you like this. Young master, your words please me greatly. Please take the coach. Okano, introduce us to him. Yes, I forgot. I was so taken with him. We'll take him to the inn first. He must be tired. Right. Excuse me. Welcome back. Father often told me how kind the village headmaster was. Really? I never imagined he'd say that about me. I'm glad he had such a good friend. You're much too kind. Mr. Kenzo Watase was so generous 15 years ago. Just thinking about him fills me with tears. Young master. I'm in charge of fishing on the island. I'm the fishermen's leader. My name is Goichi Hayashida. How do you do? I'm glad to meet you. Since I'm in fishing, I had close connections with your father's shipbuilding. He told me about you. You're the most influential. You heard about me? I had a very close relationship with him. I almost forgot. I'm sorry. And this is Seigo Nobadama. He runs a stagecoach company. I'm the president. I was only 21 when Mr. Watase was working here. I remember how kind he was to me. I heard about it. Then, did he tell you about me, too? Yes. What did he say? That you were a bright young man. Really? I'm so happy I could die right now. You're fortunate, aren't you? And this is the assistant village master here. My name's Ryoji Hirayu. He's been to college. He's the most educated one here. Then we'll be good friends. I'm sure we have a lot in common. Likewise. Thank you. Welcome. Have some tea. Did Mr. Watase pass away in Tokyo after all? Yes. It was in Tokyo in 1935, the same year I graduated from college. So you've completed your studies? Yes. He worried about this island to the end. About this island? He was such a great man. May I ask you what you do in Tokyo now? I should have told you sooner. My father was with a southern development company. I'm the managing director now. My subordinates do the actual work. A managing director? He's in a different class than you, “President.” Tokyo must be a great place to work. Young master, you must be tired from your journey. You should take a bath and get some rest. Good idea. I prepared a quiet room upstairs for you. Thank you. Oharu! Hey! You work here? - Yes. Didn't I wire you that I was coming today? Excuse me? No one came for me. I've never been here before. It was hard to get here. This is unheard of. Who are you? Who else? I'm Kensuke Watase, Kenzo Watase's son. Mr. Village Chief! Please come. What is it? I'm not mad at the village chief. This man says he's Kensuke Watase. I wired you from Nagasaki. Don't tell me you didn't get it. Wait a minute. The village chief, Okano, they're very nice. All of you! Come! - What? - Come. Excuse us. What could it be? Hey! Don't “hey” me. Can't I stay here? You're really his son? What's with the “really”? I'm Kenzo Watase's son. Kid brother! You came, too? -No, I — Why didn't you tell me? We could've come together. Let me introduce him. This is my brother. I'm Kensuke Watase. And he's Kenji Watase. Greet them. Wipe that look off your face. Greet them. How do you do? So that's why we got two telegrams. You wired them, too? You used my name, didn't you? It's true. Now that he's here, I'd appreciate your kindness to him. I meant to leave him in Tokyo, but... We're glad he's here. He wanted to come, too, didn't he? I thought he was a fake. He thought you were a fake. Do you know how you looked? The look on your face said, “I claim to be Kensuke Watase but I'm really a con man. The man who arrived earlier is a con man as well.” You couldn't fool anyone, not even for a minute. I didn't expect to find you here. Ass! Thanks to me, you're still safe. You beat me to it. I'm the one who found the Watase stuff. I'm the one who came up with all this. Never mind. We'll pretend we're brothers. I planned to split the money 70-30, but now we'll go halves. Naturally. Let me tell you something. No more outwitting each other, okay? We'll only trip each other up. Sure. Gentlemen's agreement. Some gentlemen! What's wrong? It'll be a nice day tomorrow. It's been nice for days. No rain. No heavy surf. It's so peaceful. It's a cop. I feel hunted down. Like a rat by a cat? What did you tell them? That I'm managing director of a southern development company. You really are a bogus insurance salesman. What about you? I'll say I'm an artist. A painter. Liar. You only paint billboards. By the way, you'd better be prepared for this. I know. They're all village big shots, the village chief and all. And that young man, he's tough. He's the smartest one here. He's bright. Excuse me. You're very close, aren't you? Ryoji's here to talk to you. - I hope you aren't too tired. - Please have a seat. I want to talk about Tokyo. The subject interests me. There are too many people in Tokyo. We'll talk about it later. By the way, will you do us a favor? We were just discussing it. Now that we're in the place where our father couldn't realize his dream, I don't think reminiscing about him is enough. It's natural for his sons to think so. And? We'd like to accomplish what our father couldn't. Isn't that so? We were dreaming about it in Tokyo. I know how you feel. If he were alive today, he'd reconstruct that shipyard, too. But we can't do it alone, try as we might. We'll need the help of the islanders. I'm sure the village chief and others will agree. - You agree? - Of course. - So easily? - It's a very good thing. I'm glad. I'm pleased that you, the smartest one here, agreed so soon. Our idea is to sell shares in the shipyard here and make it something for the whole island. What a great ideal I'd like to be the first to buy as many shares as I can. Thank you. Father would be grateful to know this. I don't deserve his thanks. I can repay only the tiniest fraction of his kindness. I understand. I'll get on it right away. Please do. Going home? What are you doing? Waiting for you. Ryoji. I wonder why it's so different from when we were kids. We used to play together all the time. - It's not different. - It is! You hate me, don't you? When I came home from Batavia and found you'd grown into a fine young man, I was pleased. But you always look at me coldly. Setsuyo. What am I supposed to do? I came home empty-handed. My father has nearly gone blind. Make a fresh start. I want to make a fresh start. But I need your help for that. Don't depend on other people. You're loafing around all the time. I don't like it. Look. Nobody else is idling away their time on this island. You can do anything if you put your mind to it. Find a way to make that fresh start on your own. I'll repeat this until you realize it. I'm busy too. We'll be building a big shipyard here. I don't have time for you. Even if we build ships here and send them to the south seas, they're refusing to trade with Japan. Then we'll sell them to China. As it is, I'm already making enough of a profit. I don't feel like going into such a risky business. Do as you wish, Boss Hayashida. I'll spend all my money to help his son to build the shipyard. I'll sell my inn, too. Are you serious? Yes, I am. That's admirable. I'll sell my coach and horses too. It's been five years since the China Incident. We need more ships. I know ships will bring in a tidy profit, but — It's not a matter of money. In my opinion, it's your spirit. A man is defined by his passion. There you are. Young master. - Thank you for yesterday. - Good morning. I'll show him where the shipyard was. Good idea. - Where's Kenji? - I wonder where he is. We were discussing the shipyard. Mr. Nobadama will help, too. Then you'll all help? It's time to repay Mr. Watase's kindness. The village chief is enthusiastic. He'll mobilize us all to build the ships. What? He's interested too? Yes. The islanders must unite. It's not about turning a profit. Thank you. I truly believe my late father is helping us. Because we are people of the ocean Because we are men We all longed for The Pacific Ocean And its Japan Current Kenji! The day has come to brave the ocean together Come on up! How childish! The sea reminds him of his childhood? Here goes. - What about you? - I'll go home in the boat. - See you again tomorrow. - Sure. Bye. Good-bye. Still waving at her? It's so nice here. What's so nice? The southern sea is wonderful. It's way calmer than Tokyo. Tokyo is so crowded and dirty where I live — Stupid! Don't be ridiculous. What are you here for? I'm here to — Shut up. Your blabbing only causes trouble. The sea scares me. It's dangerous. Let's go. Nice place, isn't it? What a view! It was wise of father to choose this island. The people here are so nice. Aren't they? They are nice. We're lucky. I wish I could paint this place. Do you paint? Yes. I paint billboards. That hurt! He's from an art school. I see. Pity I didn't bring my painting supplies. Shall I ask the next ferry to bring some? There's a shop in town. Is that so? Please do. Do you have time to paint? It's not bad to paint the place where your father's shipyard was. That's true. Look, Kenji. That's where father worked. Let's pray for him. - Pray? - Sure. It's the grave of our father's dream. Let's pray. Father. We promise to complete what you began at any cost. That's too much! We'll do it. You have our word. Oh merciful Buddha, help us. KATANOURA SHIPYARD, LTD. - Here, Mr. Fujimoto. - Thank you. Next. I meant to buy five shares. That's for five. Is that so? I thought there'd be five copies. You must be tired. Why not take a rest? - You're working yourself? - Welcome. As a member of the board, you must be busy too. We're shorthanded. So we board members have to welcome the guests ourselves. This is quite a success. I just saw Mr. Hayashida. Now that everybody's so excited, he's decided to become a shareholder too. That tightwad realizes how important this is? That's it. Right, everyone? Something we talked about. The painting supplies arrived on the ferry. Thank you. I'm so glad. Master Kenji, do you paint? I'm an honest-to-god artist, unlike my brother. You even have a different accent. When I was a child I was brought up by a nurse who came from Tohoku. That explains it. I'm back. Welcome back. They say everything's in perfect order. That's good. Please come in. Oharu. Show them in. I've told them to start construction. Good. The sooner you start, the more you'll be trusted. Indeed. Please go on. That's great. Give me ten shares. You're buying them? Who cares who buys them? Setsuyo, you're buying ten shares? 200 yen. If the company makes money, you'll get dividends. What if it goes bankrupt? There's no way it'll go bankrupt unless somebody steals the money. In father's name. - For Kesaji? - Yes. Ryoji. It's all the money I brought back from Batavia. Take care with it. - It's nothing compared to Okano's — - Don't be silly. Here. Ten shares. I slaved away for this piece of paper. Excuse me. I'm starting to get nervous. Ass! That's why I didn't want you here. It's too big a job. You're a lousy crook. We came to commit fraud. We're con artists. A con artist also strives to master his craft. Master builder, schoolmaster, shipmaster — all well respected. A master con artist can't get scared at the sight of 5,000 or 6,000 yen. Brother — No, Shuzo. You mean it's only 5,000 or 6,000 yen? Well, 2,000 or 3,000 anyway. A mere thousand or two isn't real money. Just the other day I took in 1,600 yen on one job. I admit I spent some money to pull it off — about 1,800 yen. Then you lost 200 yen? No, I borrowed the 1,800 but didn't pay it back. So I made a profit. A mere thousand or two can't shock me. How dull! Look, what we got is 50,000 yen. What? 50,0007? When construction starts, we'll get another 20,000 or 30,000. 50,000 yen? Quite a sum, huh? Sure. That would be 500 100-yen notes. Five hundred? If we run off with as much as 50,000 yen, they'll be furious. Absolutely. You bet they will. They'll be furious. What'll we do? They even plan to sail the ship they build to the south seas. They're only daydreaming. Life isn't that easy. Right. They'll end up getting robbed blind by swindlers. - Swindlers? - That's us. That reminds me, I don't think this is right for me. I just feel good here. You getting senile? Oharu is kind. Okano is nice, too. - Let's get away on tomorrow's ferry. - Tomorrow? The engineers are going home. We'll find an excuse to join them. We'll leave for good. But what if we get caught? That's why we need to scram. A big job like this tends to have a lower success rate. My experience tells me — Can't forget Oharu? She's so nice. I'll get away by myself. - What about me? - You'll get caught. - And talk. - About me, too? Can't help it. Might as well. Then I'll get caught, too. Let's run away together. Welcome. Want some shares? Excuse me, isn't this an inn? Looking for a room? That's why I've never seen you before. Madam! What is it? You're... I didn't know this was your place. I never expected you here. Let's talk. Come inside. Do come in. It's been ten years already. I went as far as Penang. But Mr. Watase loved you. You took him away. It made me so mad. And what brings you here? Don't tell me you came here to humiliate me again? I'd never do that. I just wanted to visit the place where my husband used to come. I hate to be humiliated. “Mr. Watase didn't want Okano” — I don't want people to talk like that. I don't mean to — Did you know that Mr. Watase had two sons? You didn't? He was married before he had you. They're both fine young men. And where are they? Staying here. They're the president and director of the Katanoura Shipyard. I'm determined to help them with the shipyard until they succeed. Which of us do you think Mr. Watase would have been happier with? “Okano was the one who really loved me after all.” That's what he'd say. Then they're going to follow in my husband's footsteps and build a shipyard? Exactly. Okano, I won't say any more. Just build ships. It seems he never got over the shipyard. Very well. I'll help. What are you going to do? I have no friends anywhere, so I came here where he spent so much time. Is she Mr. Watase's child? Yes. What a nice girl! Children are so innocent. Very well. I'll take care of you two. I believe Mr. Watase has brought us together. With this child, and you've no one to rely on? Stay here for a while. Thank you. You'll find a job soon enough. Thank you. In return, I want you to promise me something. Don't tell anyone that Mr. Watase married you later. Or I'd feel sorry for his sons. All right? Yes. Will you wait a minute? I'll find you a room. Madam. What do you think of me? Well, I suppose... I feel like you're my son. That makes it even worse. Get a hold of yourself. Where's father's ship? We'll look for it later. How odd! There's no way your father could have had any other children. Why so blue? I don't want to go to Nagasaki. It's only for a few days. The ship could sink. Are you worried about that? I may not be able to see you again. Those ships have never sunk before. Mine may turn out to be the first. My ship must sink sometime. - A sly fox's ship must. - A fox? But you're no sly fox. Yes, I am. I came here to commit fraud. Then try deceiving me. I wouldn't mind being deceived by you. Oharu... Do you really mean that? You wouldn't be angry, even if I deceived you? Thank you. Your saying that makes me feel that there's hope for me. We have preparations to make. We'll start construction in the new year. This year's almost over. Start as soon as possible. Please do your best. Sorry to keep you. Where's Kenji? I don't know. What a guy! Can't you go to Nagasaki without him? Yes. But I think I'll go look for him. I'll send Eikichi. Chief. It's urgent. Will you come to the office right now? The village chief wants you. - Why? - Just come quickly! I wonder why. He said to come by bicycle. It seems very urgent. Excuse me. - Good day. - Good day. I wonder what happened. Sodo I. Is it about our company? Our company has been issued a permit by the government. I don't think it's about us. Let's hope not. Where have you been? Come. Are you sure? Absolutely. The janitor gave me an evil look. And? - Obviously, he suspects me. - You're imagining things. I've got a feeling they're onto us. What a shame. It's like I came here just to live a dream. Dreaming only gets you into trouble. Come on, get ready. This isn't mine. That one's mine! This is no time to make a fuss! What's going on? Someone's shouting. - That janitor thing? - Coming to get us? Seems we're finished. Young masters! Big news! The police want us? No. Japan has declared war against America and England. What's that? Don't you get it? Japan has started fighting America and England. “Today, December 8, at dawn, the Imperial Navy carried out a death-defying air raid against the US fleet and air armada at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.” “Today, at dawn in Shanghai, the Imperial Navy also sank a British gunboat named Pef —" “Sank a British gunboat named Peferel.” They did it! “The US gunboat Wake surrendered immediately.” Banzai! Ryoji must have been glad to write this as he heard the news. You can tell by his writing. The village office will spread the news using the coach. Tomekichi. We're Japanese after all. We shouldn't run off with the money on such an important day. I've been against running away from the start. The news really hit me. Me too. I almost wept. Only the Empire of Japan could have done it. Young masters! Everyone's here. Please come. Something occurred to me today. As the news said, we're sinking enemy warships. That means their warships and submarines will come close to Japan. Of course, we're at war. Think about it. Let's say we build a ship at our shipyard. Let's say this ship is sunk. Our company will incur a loss. Naturally. The company's loss means the stockholders' loss. The more shares a person holds, the greater the loss. What are you trying to say? We should forget about the shipyard? Return the money in exchange for the stock certificates. What are you saying? The Pacific Ocean is vast. A couple of enemy subs may naturally sneak in. Naturally, a few of our ships may fall victim to them. But if they're sunk, the investors will lose. I know. But as the news said, our Army troops have gone as far as the Malay Peninsula. They were all transported by ships. We need lots of ships. Japan is a strong nation. It has enough ships. We can't make a difference with a ship or two. That's just your selfish theory. There are never enough ships during wartime. If we don't have enough ships, we'll lose. Mr. Watase often said so. But listen — Mr. Hayashida. What? I never imagined that someone like that was among us. All right. I'll buy all your shares. I'll sell all my coaches and horses. Now, now, Mr. Nobadama. Don't talk like that. Aren't you Japanese? What? Can you call yourself Japanese? Stop it, both of you! I'm Japanese! I'm not so sure! Stop it! Mr. Hayashida, can you call yourself Japanese? When we're all so earnest, why think only about yourself? What good is money? It's not money that counts. What counts is winning the war. Think it over, Mr. Hayashida. Excuse me. I'm sorry to bother you. What do you want? Please take this, although it's not much. What is it? It's all I can give. What does it say? “For nails.” What does that mean? Money to buy nails for use at the shipyard. When I heard about the war, I knew I had to do something. Please use it to buy as many nails as you can to build ships. For nails to be used at the shipyard? I'm sorry if I'm only interfering. That money is what I saved for my child's schooling. Okay. I don't know how to thank her. I feel like crying. Even a stranger does this? Sorry I haven't introduced her to you. She's one of my relatives. She arrived yesterday. I may get her a job at the shipyard after it's built. Even a stranger wants to help. Mr. Hayashida, I don't understand you. Hey. Kesaiji. Hello, boss. What brings you? Will you do me a favor? Please put me on your boat once more. I'd like to, but — War has broken out. I can't stand idly by. Even in my state, I see better at sea than on land. I'll find skipjacks for you. Kesaji... You might go blind. I don't mind. A tide-watcher blinded by the sea is like a soldier killed in action. Please. Let me work on your fishing boat. Big news! Great success! The surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was successfull Two enemy ships sunk! Everyone inside? This is wonderful. In addition, four battleships and four large cruisers were heavily damaged. Time flies. It turned out everything went as we predicted. Singapore and Java surrendered. Shipbuilding is a high priority for the government. Everything's all right now. Indeed. In two weeks it'll sail by itself. Great, isn't it? In two weeks? Mr. President, look how well built it is. Hayashida. You were against it, but you seem happy now, watching the ship being completed. Aren't you? Far from it. I'm never happy. I feel like I'm losing money day by day. What are you saying? I've invested a fortune in this ship. Too large a sum to give up. Hayashida. Can't you think about anything but money? Mr. Watase. I saw your father fail 15 years ago on this very beach. That's why I'm worried. I can't be as optimistic as Nobadama. Blockhead! Times have changed. Mr. Watase tried it at the wrong time. This time, you don't have to worry about it. Things are different now. The islanders are more earnest. There's Kenji. Excuse me. What's wrong, lady-killer? When will you finish it? I can't work, feeling like this. It must be serious then. Stare at the sea for a while, Shuzo. Why? Or keep your eyes closed for a while. What for? Just do it. The warm south breeze. The fresh smell of the sea. The sea whispers tenderly. Don't play poet! Why so blue? I've been wondering, when we're surrounded by glorious nature and by such nice people, why must we act so dirty and cowardly and scared all the time? What happened? Were you jilted by Oharu? She's out of my reach. It makes me suffer. I'm a con man. I can't marry her. Let's make a run for it, Shuzo. There's a ferry leaving tonight. I'm through being a fox. A fox? Or a sly fox. Let's get out. You can go alone. You're the one who wanted to leave. I don't think I can. Look at the villagers. So happy, like children. I can't leave them now. Deep down, I must be good. Good or bad, we're only con artists after all. No. I can't run off before I see the ship completed. Though I'll be penniless by then. Don't you mind? I want money too. I want to repay the railway money I borrowed. That's what causes my suffering. As I watch the ship gradually taking shape I feel happy and sad at the same time. I'm never completely happy. I know how you feel. Building it wasn't part of the plan. No, but... On December 8th you shouted, “Can you call yourself Japanese?” I feel a little embarrassed now. But I was really excited at the time. Hey! You mustn't paint pictures of this view. It's forbidden to make pictures of the coastline. Of course. Sorry, Officer. Remember that you're the president of the shipyard. We'll be careful. I'll take this. All right? I don't mind. Keep it, although it's not much to look at. You're right. Oh? It's raining. Where's your mother? She took tea to that ship. You're alone? Good girl! Mister, when will my father's ship sail? Very soon. What? What did you say just now? When will my father's ship sail? Your father? What does he do? He was building a ship here. Is that true? Mother said so. This is bad! - What'll we do? - Don't ask me. She's the real one. What happens to us now? Some rain! It's pouring. I'll make some tea. Don't bother. Stay until the rain stops. Mother. Wait a minute. Shall we go now? It's still raining. We're finished. Let's take our chances. Is it all right? Sorry, I haven't given you cushions. Please have a seat. Oyuki — No. Madam. The money you gave us for nails and your hard work at the shipyard make us feel that there's something going on. Will you be honest with us? About what? Did she say something to you? Yes, in a way. Will you please forgive me? Forgive me. What's wrong? I'm sorry. Forgive me. I didn't know your father had sons before he married me. We didn't know about you either. I met your father in Penang. I believed he was single. I didn't doubt it. Is that so? I feel sorry for your mother. Please don't. That's all right. Our mother died many years ago. I don't know how to apologize. We're a family. You're a mother to us too. Thank you. We'll make sure everything works out. SEAGULL INN Okano! Madam Okano! Hurry, Okano! The ship will be ruined! What? The storm. It's destroying the ship. I can't do a thing alone. Hurry! I'll go now. Tell Nobadama and Hayashida. Blood! It's just my fingers. Never mind. Oharu! Eikichi! Young masters! What a terrible storm! Do you know where the young masters are? No. I wonder when they left. The storm door is open! They may be at the beach already. You get ready, too. No way the ferry will sail in this storm. We just wanted to leave so bad we didn't check the weather report. Let's go back before they find out. That's Oyuki! She's after us. Okano! Okano! Oyuki, hang on! I'm sorry. It's all our fault. We'll give ourselves up. We won't hurt you. Mrs. Watase! Are you all right? The storm is damaging the ship. Please save the ship. It's his ship. Hurry and go tell Mr. Hayashida and save the ship. You care about the ship that much? Yes. It's more important than my life. I understand. Let's go, Tomekichi. Don't worry. Wait. Tomekichil I'm ashamed. We deceived her when she loved her husband so much. I'm deeply ashamed. We're the worst kind of men. Listen. When the ship's completed and launched, we'll give ourselves up to the police. Wait a little longer. Two more weeks. Let's go. WATASE-MARU LAUNCHING CEREMONY Fireworks don't make much sense without those two. Yeah. I wonder what happened. We can look for them, but this is such a small island. They can't have gone anywhere on this day of celebration. But they aren't here. What do they think about us shareholders? Look. I looked in their room and the closet but there's nothing there. - Nothing? - That's right. That's odd. Have you seen the men from the inn? Those two funny guys? We haven't seen them. Hello! Have you seen the shipyard president? Have you seen our president? Forget him! What happened? The fishing boats were attacked. Kesaji's dead. A US sub did it. Only one boat came back. Kesaji's dead? Setsuyo! Cry as much as you can! Curse the American devils! Let me gol I can't just stay here. I'll go fishing! For Kesaiji! But it's dangerous. If I let American subs scare me, I'll be disgraced as a Japanese fisherman. I must make up for Kesaji's death! I know how you feel, Hayashida. Nobadama! For the first time, I realize that there's something far more important in this world than money. That's right. Hayashida, you are Japanese after all. Thank you, Mr. Nobadama. The ships must come first for us to win. Build as many ships as you can. I don't care if I spend all my money. Come with me. Oyuki, Mr. Watase was a great man, wasn't he? Fifteen years ago, he predicted this day would come. He'd be satisfied, I suppose. Yes, he would. The islanders will be all about ships now. It's for Japan. By the way, those two — I wonder where they are. I can't see the island anymore. Oharu... Okano, Oyuki, Nobadama, Hayashida, the village chief, Ryoji, good-bye to all of you. I never imagined I'd arrest the shipyard executives and take them to Nagasaki. We feel odd too. We were trying to do something bad. But we ended up building a ship. Let's make a fresh start.
