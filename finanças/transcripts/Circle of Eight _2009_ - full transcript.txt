Just about 25 seconds left now. In a few moments, all of Broadway will erupt as the ball makes its journey, bringing in the New Year. We got some big flames up there. Code N at The Dante warehouse. Okay, there it is. The crowd is counting down. It's not a warehouse anymore. They changed it to a bunch of lofts. Yeah, no shit! There are people in there. ♪ I'm gonna set My soul on fire ♪ ♪ My heart beats low While the flames grow higher ♪ ♪ Strike the match And then the truth is told ♪ ♪ I'm gonna set My soul on fire ♪ ♪ The Devil made me a woman I ain't no liar ♪ ♪ Her eyes burn black Like the lake of fire ♪ ♪ She struck the match And then I sold my soul ♪ ♪ For the black-haired girl From the lake of fire ♪ ♪ I'm gonna set My soul on fire ♪ ♪ My heart beats low While the flames go higher ♪ ♪ Strike the match And then I sold my soul ♪ ♪ I just set my soul on fire ♪ Oh! Damn it. You gotta ring the bell at the desk. Oh? Thank you. You're welcome. I'm Evan, by the way. Evan. Right. I knew that. You did? No, I mean, bad joke. Never mind. I'm Jessica. Jessica, cool. Hey, I gotta run out for a second, but when I get back, I'll help you with your stuff. That mirror's gonna be too heavy for one person to carry. Oh! Okay, thanks. Funny how he knew, isn't it? About what? About your mirror. What the hell? The Dante. I'm sorry? It's The Dante. I'm The Ed. My name is Ed. Oh! Okay, then I think I'm in the right place. If you think so. I'm Jessica. I'm a day early, but I sent in my paperwork. Eight C Here's your key. Rules and regulations. And if I may draw special attention to Regulation 9, Subsection 3, no tenants are permitted in the file room under any circumstances. And the toilet runs. Sometimes you have to jiggle the handle. Is there anything that I should know about the apartment, like maintenance or anything? The toilet runs. Sometimes you have to jiggle the handle. Right. Must be a pretty big change for you. Oh, my God, yes. Where I come from, it's mostly cows and churches. Not a lot of either one of those here. Here it's artists. Mostly musicians, painters, writers. And although they can be a little... cuckoo, my thought is, before you know it, you'll feel like you've known them all for years. Thanks, Ed. Which way is it? Thank you. Oh, Jessica? Yeah? Happy New Year. Oh! Thank you. You, too. And remember, stay out of the file room. Right. No, I will. For sure. Daniel! Daniel! Hey, there you are. No. Not again. Counterproductive. They're naked, and they're doing it. Counter-productive. Who is it? It's Ed. I've got things to do. Open up. Thank you. What's this for? You put it in your lamp. It makes light. Okay. Be sure to lock up. Seriously? Oh, hey! Please don't turn around yet. I haven't finished documenting the shape of the back of your head. Excuse me, can you stop taping me, please? No, I can't. Hold on, I'm coming over. What the hell is the deal with this place? Hey, can you not just come in here? I don't know you. Okay, noted, noted. Let me just get some footage... Hey, hey, hey, hey... Stop it! Okay, okay, okay. All right. Yes. Introductions first, then I can film you. I get this part wrong every time. Hey, hey, hey, I'm sorry. I'm not really good with people. I'm much better with this little lady, you know. Your eyes, they're a little far apart. It's endearing. - Stop! - Randall! Please do not scare the new girl. We're going to be spending a lot of time with her. Hi, I'm India. Hi. And this is my man-munchy, Damon. The pleasure's all mine. Randall here means well. I do. He's just, how do I put this nicely, One hundred percent socially retarded. I am. He's making a documentary about this building. The building, the people, how things connect. Every day here feels like a lifetime. And I'm his favorite subject. Yeah, India used to be an Internet sensation. I used to host a political talk show in my panties. But that's all in the past now. You guys really don't need to tell me all this. There's no use keeping secrets. They all come out sooner or later. So, what about you, Jessica? What are you hiding? Me? Oh... Nothing. I'm just a farm girl from a small family. It's just me, my mom and my dad. So, are you coming to the party? What? Are you coming tonight? Oh? Yeah, I'm gonna try to make it. Sorry, I just... You thinking about your brother? Dude, she said it was only her and her parents. Right. Well, anyway, please try to make it. It's pretty kick-ass. We count down the seconds on the roof. Three, two, one. Happy New Year! And then we party till dawn. Yeah. Um, okay, yeah, maybe. I'm pretty tired. Come. It's always, always amazing. We've been doing it for years. Like, forever. I'm sorry. Your door wasn't locked. No, that's okay. I guess. You guys have a really different understanding of personal privacy in this place. Yeah, I came to give you something. A little welcome gift. Thank you. Can I not be naked when you give it to me? Yeah, I'm sorry. Of course. Yeah. So, do you always walk into other people's apartments? Not always. I try to limit my surprise visits to twice a week. How considerate. Welcome to The Dante. Wow. This is crazy. In a good way. Oh, yes, the good kind of crazy. Thank you. Well, that's really sweet of you. I have to say that, so far, this place has been pretty weird. I know, and I wanted to talk to you about that. I know it's weird here. And I've been living here for a while. And... All right, look. Things happen in this building. I mean... What are you trying to say? Like, the building is haunted? No, no, no. No, just saying... I'm just saying that you can trust me. And I want you to trust me and believe whatever I have to say. Like, no matter what happens. Okay. Well, right now, you're kind of scaring me, so... Please. Just... Just trust me. Why should I? Hi! I hope we're not interrupting anything. Well, you are. We wanted to introduce ourselves, say hello. My name is Bale. This is my husband Bale, and I'm Elaine. And this little guy is either Hunter or Caleb. Which do you think is cuter? Well, either way, we're just so happy to have you here at The Dante. It's a really tight-knit group here. Really, really tight-knit group. Good group. Good guys, good girls. Women. Women. Do you want to see a picture of him? See? That is his little face right there, that little white, shady thing. And I say he looks like a bowl of noodles because I eat so much pad Thai. That doesn't make sense... It's a joke, Bale. God. Anyway, those are his little hands. They're cute, right? Adorable. We're thinking about naming him Hunter, 'cause it's my mother's maiden name and she's kind of sick right now, so it would mean a lot to her. Guys, could we just stick to the small talk for now? - Slow it down a little? - Yeah. I mean, I'm really sorry to hear about that, but is there a reason that you guys are telling me all of this? It just makes you think about how connected we all are. How when one person leaves this Earth, it affects so many other people. It's the circle of life. Exactly. No. No, not exactly, but, you know... What a shame it would be if we were gone. Well, anyway, we're just so happy to have you here. Wait, there's something else. Something... - Oh! The party! - The party. You heard about the party? You have to come. It's on the roof. Lights, food, drinks, the whole thing. You'll come. It's awesome. Okay. We should get going. Shame. I'll walk these guys out. I have a question about the party. Bye! Nice to meet you. Jessica. Huh? I'm Jessica. You never asked what my name was. Oh, we knew that already, from talking to India. Bye. Sorry, I need to talk to these guys. It never has and never will. We're getting closer. What else are we gonna do? That never worked. Never has and never will. Please don't do anything. It has to work. Hello? Jessica? Hey, hey, it's India. I got your phone number from Ed. Oh, hey. What's going on? Do you know where Damon is? I can't find... and I need to... him right now. Please, please, keep an eye out for him and... Hello? Hello? Damn. Hey, do you guys know where Damon is? Hey, you guys? Hello? Hey, Evan? Damon? Guys? Hello? Anyone? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Ed? Ed? Help! Somebody, please help! Somebody help! Help! Stop. Stop! Stop! Please! Stop! Please stop! Please stop! Stop! Help me! Help! Stop. Please. Shit! Wow, this is bad. He's been murdered. He's been murdered. He's been murdered! You have to come and help. So weird. He... He was right here. It was... It was horrible. It's okay. Just stay calm. Are you sure he was here? Maybe it was another floor. But he was... He was somewhere. Ma'am, have you been drinking? I saw a dead body. India, you... You told me that he was missing and then I found him here. Who's missing? Damon. Huh? Damon! Damon. I just got a text from him a minute ago. He just sent it? Well, maybe five minutes ago. Yeah, 7:30. Why? I saw him right here, and he was... Yeah. You're welcome. That's so weird. No, I probably just made you think something was wrong. You know, calling you, being over-dramatic. I'm so sorry. Look, I've just been a total head case. I mean, totally insane, obsessing about whether Damon was going to propose to me. Well... Wow, that's really super exciting. Congratulations. Thanks. Bye. Bye. I don't understand. It was real. I know that it was real. I think maybe you should go back to your apartment and get some rest. I don't really want to be alone right now. Okay, then. Well, how about my apartment? Would a drink help? How about 10? I just don't get it. I mean, Damon was right there. Those are really beautiful. I'm still working on perfecting it, but... What do they mean? Excuse me? What are they all... saying? I mean, you are... You are trying to say something with all of these, right? I mean, I don't know. What's the point, otherwise? I really... I really like that you asked that. Yeah, I'm interested in the idea of spirit as energy. Like, the part of us that never dies. Or the part that's always been, always will be, and was born outside of time. So it was never really created and it can never really be destroyed. It floats. Free. That part of us. What's that? That's how I do it. I learned the first step on the Internet. You take a bottle of Mountain Dew. Pour most of it out. Leave a little bit in. Pour in some peroxide. Two shakes of baking soda. Watch. Take your shirt off. It's okay. Okay, go behind the glass. Do this. Like this? Eyes on me. The paint doesn't stay forever, so if you'd... Yeah, now I can download these images, composite them, and use them in any one of my pieces of work. Yeah, but you lose the original. But I never lose the spirit. The form is always shifting. It's always migrating. But always, in essence, the same. Forever. I felt like I had to do that. Like I was meant to do that. You were. This has to happen for the right reason. What? Well, what's the right reason? I want you. That seems like a perfect reason. Something more. Something special. I don't want our first time to happen before it should happen. I don't know what that means. I mean, look, you're a little vulnerable right now. I mean, you got spooked back there. I don't know what happened. But let's make sure that when we do this, we really want to do this. That is the sweetest, lamest thing I think I have ever heard. Thank you? So I guess I'll just have to go. You're killing me. You have no idea how bad I want this to happen. What's that? Oh! That shouldn't be there. That's an experimental... I think you should leave. Wait, hold on. Jessica, please. Okay, listen. I just want to say... I want to apologize for how I acted just now. You know, sometimes, I don't know. I get so caught up in my work, and it just seems like everything else is... pointless. So I'm pointless. No, no, no, no, it's just... I'm sorry. We were on the light table, and... I don't know. Maybe I'm just not a very nice guy. No. I think you're an okay enough guy. Okay, then. We'll leave it at that. Okay. Let me go! Let me go! Jessica, calm down. Look at me. Just look at me. She's dead. I just saw her. You didn't see anything. Calm down. No, no, no. Somebody put this plastic thing on her head. Who's doing this? Are you? Not me. Why should I believe you? Well, you have to. I am getting out of here right now. You can't. It's not that simple. Our newest resident sure is finding her experience at The Dante to be an interesting one. Not now, Randall, Jesus! You're not supposed to address the camera directly. It ruins the authenticity. Randall, just go back to your nerd palace and leave us alone, okay? Here we have Evan of Loft 8F, uncharacteristically losing his cool. Everyone's not quite themselves of late here at The Dante. Get the fuck out! Just listen to me. The worst thing you can do right now is start digging around this place looking for answers. Forget about India. Forget about Damon. Forget about the file room... Getting to know each other? Little hallway action. Nice. Guys, the party starts in two hours. We're gonna run out, grab some guacamole, maybe some margarita mix. Don't know, could get crazy. Yeah, that sounds really insane. Right? Listen. I was just coming down the hallway and I swear that I saw... You saw... Jessica! Jessica! Evan, I don't know what's going on. But I think my mind is playing tricks on me. Look, this place has a tendency to do that. Oh, that is so true. Just last week I thought I'd put all my clothes away from the laundry. But I hadn't. There were, like, three blouses that I'd completely forgotten about. And Bale thought it was a riot. I don't... I don't remember that. Okay, well, you know, I think I need to go back to my apartment. I'm really not feeling so great. 911 emergency. Hi, yes, I need to report an emergency. A couple of emergencies, actually. I don't know what's going on. You don't know what's going on? I mean, I saw people. I thought I did... Ma'am, I'm trying to help you here. What is the exact nature of your emergency? There were bodies. I saw dead bodies. Can you just send somebody? Okay, please, ma'am. Just try to tell me in plain English what is going on. I'm freaking out. I think people might be dying. Ma'am, are you okay? You sound quite distraught. Do you need psychiatric help? Fuck, don't we all? Excuse me? Can you just send somebody, please? What is your address? It's The Dante building. And the address is? The address is... I have it here somewhere. Hold on. It's... It's 11738... 1-1-738? Yeah. I need a street name, Jessica. Are you sure you're okay? No, I'm not sure at all. Jessi... Hello? Hey, Ed. I was just looking around. I thought I told you not to go into the file room. I guess I forgot. So, what do you keep down here? Human bones. I'm just screwing with you. It's a boring supply room. I just don't want people coming down here and stealing all my cleaning supplies. Oh? Well, I would never touch your cleaning supplies. You better not because they're cursed. Again, screwing with you. So, how are you enjoying our fine apartment building? Interesting tenants. That Evan is pretty dreamy. How's that whole thing working out for you? What whole thing? Oh, I don't know. You and Evan. I figure the new girl would like a guy like that. If not, I'm a pretty charming fellow myself. I could take you out for a coffee or something harder, if that's your taste. Oh? Um... Maybe after I get situated. Maybe later, when I get comfortable here. Yes... later. Sounds great. What's the worst thing you've ever done? I'll go first. Okay. I used to live in central Illinois. Middle America. Good, wholesome corn country. You ever tasted an ear of sweet corn in mid-July? I don't think so. Well, you'd know if you had. You can eat that stuff raw and it's absolutely delicious. That's why they call corn "nature's candy." Nature's candy. I don't think people actually call it that. Maybe not, but they should. Anyway, where were we? Worst thing I've ever done, Middle America... Yes, I was hiking in this beautiful state park, Allerton, surrounded by beauty and all of a sudden, I get this terrible headache. Pounding. You ever had a migraine? Anyway, terrible headache. I need to lie down. It's hot out, so I break into a car in the parking lot, hot-wire it and crank the AC to keep myself cool. Are you following? Well, that was the day I learned how easy it is to hot-wire a car. One month later, I had stolen over 500 cars. SUVs, minivans, what have you. Started one of the most lucrative chop shops in Illinois history. I was pulling in $500,000 a month, living the good life. So what happened? I blew it up my nose. I got super-addicted to nasal spray. Why isn't the elevator moving? I didn't push the button. Figured we could have a little getting-to-know-you time. Fair enough. We'll talk about you some other time. Wait a minute. Feel this, man. Randall. Dude, you can feel it. I really wanted you to stay. So what went wrong? Short answer? Trust. Lack of trust. I really... Look, I really wanted you to stay. When you were talking about your artwork, you said that this energy inside of us that travels from body to body, you said that it's always the same. And see, I disagree. People change. People change, but not our essence. No, our essence, too. And you really believe that? Sure. Like, are you always going to be afraid of getting close to people? No. You think that that's your essence now, but time's going to flow forward and you're going to change, and you'll be, you know, different. Yeah? Absolutely. What's going to change me? Well, what changes anybody? Love. And, you know, you didn't even notice it while it was happening, but you're different in essence. And before you know it, you've got hope again. And trust. You've changed. Yeah. And anything is possible? Anything is possible. Sure hope that's true. Of course it's true. I really wanted you to stay. Why? Why are you fucking with my head? Tell me what I ever did to you! Jessica! I saw myself say that. Right before I saw Randall. Hello? Damn it! Why? Why are you guys doing this to me? Why is everybody dying? He was electrocuted. I found him just 20 seconds ago. I know. I know you didn't do this. Of course I didn't do this. Why would you say something like that to me? I don't know. I'm sorry. I'm going to call an ambulance. They'll take care of this. I don't understand how you can be so calm about this. This man is dead. People are dying. They're getting killed. How do you know that you're not next? How do you know any of this is happening at all? Because I can see this dead kid in front of me. And I couldn't do anything to save him. Jessica, there was nothing you could have done. Okay? It was too late. I didn't try to save him. But he's going to make it, right? He's gonna be okay? You did everything you could. No, I didn't. I didn't do everything that I could. I wanted to save him. I wanted to try to save him, but I was afraid he was too heavy. I thought he was going to drag me down. I thought that I could only save myself. I got scared and I let him go. I let my little brother drown! You think what? It's just fine that I didn't do everything that I could? That I got scared and I just saved myself? I wanted to save him. I want my brother back! I need to do this again, okay? I need... I need to try to save him. So, please, just let me do this again. Please, I know that I can save him. I'm sorry. That's not going to happen. Jessica? Jess? Jessica? Where's Daniel? Daniel? My brother? What's happening? You passed out in Randall's apartment. You said you were feeling overwhelmed by something. Randall. He was dead, too. Jessica, there's a purpose to all of this. I swear. Or at least you have to hope that there is. Don't give me that. Don't try to sell me on hope. Come in, I guess. I'm sorry to interrupt, lovebirds. It's just a reminder about the party. It starts in, like, 45 minutes. And if you could bring a bottle of Pinot or any red, really, that would be pretty sweet. Is this really what you guys want to talk about right now? This stupid party? This lame, annual Dante New Year's party for anyone who's lucky enough to be alive? Easy there, killer. I am not the killer. Maybe you are. You're crazy. Randall's dead. Go ahead and act surprised, since you're probably the ones who killed him. Jessica, wait. And out of these two, I'm gonna put my money on this one, since I'm pretty sure this guy doesn't have enough balls to do it. What was your name again? Bill? Bale. Wow, Bale. I've seen three dead bodies today, but a dude named Bale is probably the craziest thing I've had to deal with all day. Hey! That's my man. Yeah. Good luck with that. You want to talk? Let's talk. None of this shit went down till you showed up in this place. Yeah! You think I'm doing this? The only thing I know right now is that I am not doing any of this. I don't know who's doing it, and I don't know who's next. Nobody's next, Jessica. Don't say that. And remember, I'm with child. What an unspeakable tragedy that would be. Why do you talk like that? What is it with this place? You know they don't make death certificates for unborn babies. But they should. Why? Why are you fucking with my head? Tell me what I ever did to you! Tell me! Jessica. I saw myself say that. Right before I saw Randall. I saw myself... And then I saw myself say that, too. I heard myself say that on the tape from the file room. What is this place? Who are you people? Leave me alone! Get out of my fucking head! Get out of my head! Get out of my head! How did you know what I was going to do before I did it? How is all of this happening? Hey! India? I know I saw you! What is going on here? Somebody tell me something! Please! It's all right, Jessica. It's okay. Everything's okay. No. I think I'm going insane. I don't know. Just make it stop. I need you to come up to the roof with me. Please, come up on the roof with me. Why? Because it's New Year's. Everything is going to become clear, and everything's going to change. Either of you guys want half a burrito? I can't finish this. I'll eat that. Roof, please. You coming? No. I don't know. I think I need to lie down. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Look at me, look at me. It's okay. They're all dead. I just want this nightmare to be over. Come with me. If you want to end this nightmare, come with me. And stay with me. I don't get it. It's you and me. That's all that matters. Evan, I have lost my mind. I don't know what's happening anymore. I don't know if I'm going to die. I don't know if you're going to die. I don't know if... I mean, maybe I'm the one who's killing them. Maybe I'm blacking out and going on killing sprees, and you're covering it up for me. It makes about as much sense as anything, right? No. No, hey, look at me. Do you feel... Do you feel what I feel for you? Because I've got nothing left to make you trust me. I have been lying to you. But it's going to stop now. Why? You'll see, and you're going to understand. It's all going to come together and make sense, I promise. But you're gonna have to make a choice. I'll be with you. I'll be right there. Because I love you. Hey, Jessica. What the... Her hair looks a little more disheveled since the last time we saw her. What's going on? Who are you people? Please, just stop messing with me. Evan! Guys, just leave her alone! Are you stressed? You don't seem quite like yourself, Jessica. I'm so glad you were able to make the party. How are you even alive? Ma'am, are you okay? You sound really distraught. Do you need psychiatric help? You sound really distraught. Do you need psychiatric help? You? It was you? What are you people doing to me? Hello? Are you paying attention? We wanted you to see what it's like to see each of us die a horrible, gruesome death. Please help! Stop! He's been murdered. Let's get you cleaned up. It was really disgusting strangling myself. But I hope it got through to you. That's good. I'm going to use that one. Now? Wait. Okay, now! Why would you do that? Think about what you're going to do to us. What could I possibly do to you? I do want to say that I'm sorry if things... Bale! We have nothing to apologize for. What is wrong with you people? This guacamole is so good. As long as you're stuck here with us forever, you've got to taste some of this. You're going to mess it up again this time, aren't you? I swear I don't know what you're talking about. Actually, we are dead. Uh, excuse me. What? I'm sorry, there was a little audio hit on that last line. So, could you start that again, Jessica? A little audio hit. You people are sick. I don't know what's happening, but I know I don't want to be near you. I know that. We're here at Times Square for the biggest party in New York. This is the place to be. We've got quite a crowd forming out here tonight, getting ready to bring in the New Year. It seems like everyone in the city is out here! I couldn't watch them treat you like that. I hated the whole thing. I was never a part of that. I tried to tell you. Look, it's okay. I know you're scared, and you should be. But not of me. I don't believe you. I don't believe anybody anymore. Yeah, I know, but I still... But I still think you trust me. I don't trust anyone. Least of all you. That I don't believe. I hate you. No, you don't. You love me. Why would you say something like that? Don't mess with my head, Evan. I'm telling you what you already know. One of these days, you've got to find that. I have to believe that. "One of these days"? I have known you, what, for eight hours? You don't see it yet? Evan, please... Everything else can disappear, but not this. Not what we have. It only grows. I don't understand. You do. You have to. Jessica, I love you. Evan. I love you. What happened? It won't move! It's wedged on something. I can't move it. I'm going to get help. Jessica, don't go! Evan! I can't move! I can't move! Jessica! Evan! It's fucking jammed on something. It won't budge! Come back! Come back! I can't! Jessica, please help! I'm trying, but I can't! Oh, my God! I'm on fire! Jessica! Oh, my God! Jessica! Jessica, don't! Somebody help me! The crowd is counting down. Help me! God! Jessica! Jessica! Jessica, don't go! Jessica, don't! No! Don't leave me! Jessica! Four, three... Two, one! ♪ I'm gonna set My soul on fire ♪ ♪ My heart beats low While the flames go higher ♪ ♪ Strike the match ♪ ♪ And then the truth is told ♪ ♪ I'm gonna set ♪ ♪ My soul on fire ♪ Damn it! I always think we're getting closer. But I'm always wrong. What a shame it would be if we were gone. You thinking about your brother? What's the worst thing you've ever done? Think about what you're going to do to us. You're gonna have to make a choice. You're going to fuck it up again this time, aren't you? It seems like everyone... Flooding the streets, gathering together, really sharing this moment. I knew you'd come back here. Look, it's okay, it's okay. I know you're scared, and you should be. But not of me. I don't believe you. I don't believe anybody anymore. Yeah, I know, but I still... But I still think you trust me. I don't trust anyone. Least of all you. That I don't believe. You love me. Why would you say something like that? Don't fuck with my head, Evan! I'm telling you what you already know. One of these days, you've got to find that. I have to believe that. "One of these days"? I have known you, what, for eight hours? Don't you see it? Everything else can disappear, but not this. Not what we have. It only grows. I don't understand. You do. You have to. Evan. I love you. What happened? Shit! It won't move! I can't move it. I'm going to get help. Jessica, don't go! Evan! I can't move! I can't move! Jessica! Please come back! Move, damn you! It won't move. Jessica. I won't leave you. I'm not going to leave you. I wanted to save him. I wanted to try to save him, but I got scared and I just saved myself. Evan. I see it now, and I'm not going to leave you. Jessica. I've always loved you. I heard you guys were the first ones on the scene. Yeah. We ran up to the eighth floor, because we heard someone lived up there. We covered a lot of ground but couldn't find anybody, so we got the hell out. You guys find any bodies? We pulled six survivors from the roof. Thing is, they all swear there was a young white male and a young white female still up on the eighth floor. You guys find anybody up there? Nothing yet. We've still got another apartment to check. You see anything? Not a soul. Let's go. Where do I start? I guess I initially got interested in The Dante from the lore. The building is historical. What do you want me to tell you about The Dante? The sign above the door should read, "Abandon hope all ye who enter here, for this place is hell." Honestly, I'd hoped that we could have moved out of here before the baby was born. If you want privacy, go live in an apartment. My mom, she used to have this saying, "Good fences don't make good neighbors "because good neighbors don't need fences." I grew up in a commune. Yeah, I thought we should be someplace where the three of us could be a family, you know. Me, Elaine, the baby. We talked about it, but nothing ever seemed to happen. And now... As I began making the film, I realized that the story isn't about the history of The Dante, but about the people who live here. And now it's like something, somebody just keeps getting in our way. It's always awkward when someone new moves in. You don't know them, and they don't know you. There are all these boundaries. Jessica, she's an angel. Jessica seems like a very private person. I've drawn her a thousand times. Memorized every line on her face. Every expression she makes, every angle of her body. I'm not sure life here is going to work out for her. I'm in love with her. She doesn't know it yet. But she will. What's the most important thing about life at The Dante? Being with India. I don't care about anything else. That girl is my world. She's a goddess. That's Damon. He's so good about letting me know where he is. I'd do anything for her. That girl's to die for. Is the building haunted? I've heard rumors that it was even haunted, which I'm not sure I believe. I mean, you know, you tell a big, scary ghost story to keep people from wanting to move in. Ghosts? Come on. Really? What's the creepiest thing about The Dante? People talk about a ghost in the laundry room. They say this woman, she died there. She tied a bag around her neck and she suffocated. I think it's an urban myth, actually. Dude, it's Ed, and that super-secret file room of his. Water pipes break. Electricity doesn't work. Plumbing backs up. There's always something to keep me busy. But, seriously, if there's any skeletons in this building, they're locked in that room. With Ed's fingerprints all over the body. What's that they say? Yeah. "No rest for the wicked." I don't believe in that stuff. When I started making the film, I thought I knew where I was going. And then Jessica moved into our building. And then things changed. I realized I wasn't making a documentary about a building. I was making a documentary about a group of people who are living together and sharing their... lives and their souls. And a group of people who are linked forever. ♪ You ♪ ♪ Don't ♪ ♪ Walk ♪ ♪ Alone ♪ ♪ Because you'll worry ♪ ♪ Worry, worry Yourself to death ♪ ♪ Because you'll worry ♪ ♪ Worry, worry yourself to death ♪ ♪ My ♪ ♪ What ♪ ♪ Pretty ♪ ♪ Eyes ♪ ♪ That you've Got 'em got ♪ ♪ Got from your mom ♪ ♪ You know she'll worry ♪ ♪ Worry, worry, Worry yourself ♪ ♪ Hey, hey, worry myself ♪
