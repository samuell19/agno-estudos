[BBC sting music] - [Archbishop] Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of God and in the face of this congregation. - [Narrator] This is a true story. Everything you are about to see really happened, and almost all of what you're going to hear is what the people involved actually said. It happened in Britain 200 years ago. It's the story of a marriage between a Prince and Princess of Wales, a marriage that went wrong. [fast classical orchestral music] [George snoring] [somber orchestral music] It's been another hard night for George, Prince of Wales. He said himself that he was rather too fond of wine and women, but what's a man to do while waiting to inherit the throne? He can find a hobby. In George's case, it was architecture. It cost a fortune, but spending money was another of the Prince's favorite pastimes. He was very particular about his appearance. He spent over 20 pounds a week on lavender water, rose water, elderflower water, jasmine palmatum, orange palmatum, eau de cologne, essence of bergamot, eau de miel d'Anglettere, milk of roses, huile antique and oil of jessamine. The public hated him for his extravagance, but at least he smelled nice. It wasn't long before the Prince was in debt. He owed about 18 1/2 million pounds, at today's prices. There was only one way out, get married. Parliament had promised to come up with a great deal of money if he did. The bride-to-be was Princess Caroline of Brunswick. - When I am Princess of Wales, I want to be loved by the people. - The wish to be loved is, I think, a mistaken one, ma'am. A people should respect and honor a great princess, as they will you, if you keep your dignity and your distance. - Oh! - [Narrator] No one quite knows why Caroline of Brunwsick was chosen. True, she was Protestant, royal, and a virgin. But why was this German Princess picked over a number of other more refined, more suitable candidates? [cackling] - One damned German frau is as good as another. - [Narrator] George is said to have muttered. He sent his friend, Lord Malmesbury, as his envoy to ask for Caroline's hand in marriage. - I like singing and dancing, and... - Malmesbury found the Princess vastly happy with her future expectations, but also in need of a little reassurance. - Who do you think would make the best Princess of Wales? Myself, or do you think my sister-in-law, Princess Frederica could do better? - You are the choice of the Prince of Wales, ma'am. - Yes, but who do you think would be best? - You, ma'am, possess by nature what Princess Frederica could never acquire, beauty and grace, and all the essential qualities that Princess Frederica has, such as prudence, discretion, and tact, you may attain. - Do I want them? - You cannot have too much of them. - I shall never learn this. I am too open, too idle. - [Harris Voiceover] She has no fixed character, a light and flighty mind, but meaning well and well-disposed. My eternal theme to her is to think before she speaks, to recollect herself. Her heart is very, very light, unsusceptible of strong or lasting feelings. In some respects, this may make her happier, bu certainly not better. - [Narrator] Malmesbury had much advice to offer Caroline, but some things were too delicate to raise face to face. It was time for a discreet word with her lady-in-waiting. - Yes, it concerns His Highness the Prince of Wales and Her Highness Princess Caroline. - Jah. - His Highness the Prince of Wales is very delicate in his tastes, in his clothes, in the preparation of his toilette. - Oh, jah. - Yes, I've watched Her Highness the Princess, and she is less careful in her clothes, in her person. - Jah? - To please the Prince, attention should be paid to every part of her dress, to what is hidden, as well as what is seen. - What is, what is hidden? - The um, the um... Undergarments. Her toilette. - Oh jah, Her Highness is very quick. In morgen, she make her toilette in 15 minute. - Yes, exactly, that's precisely the problem. - What, what problem? - Madame, Her Highness the Princess smells. - Oh, is that all? I'll speak with her. [clock chiming] [bouncy classical orchestral music] - [Narrator] The next day, Lord Malmesbury was to observe that Madam Busch had executed her commission well. - How very well you look this morning, ma'am. - I don't feel particularly well. I have received a terrible letter from London. - Oh, from whom? - I don't know, it's not signed. But it says the Prince has a mistress. The Lady Jersey. What am I to do? I could be a slave to the man I love, but to a man I do not love, who does not love me, impossible. - Well, this is very evidently written by some disappointed milliner, some angry maid-servant, and deserves no attention, you must rise above it, ma'am. - Yes. Oh, I am determined never to appear jealous. I know the Prince is flighty. I am prepared on this point. - Oh, I do not believe that you will have any occasion to exercise this very wise resolution. But if any woman should try to make you jealous, never let it show. Reproaches and sourness never reclaimed anyone, and I know the Prince well enough to be quite sure that he cannot resist softness, and caresses, and this is the surest way to recover his tottering affection. - I know the Prince has been somewhat free in his way of life. But this comes from an emptiness in his situation. I was made to fill this up. I will domesticate him, make him enjoy all the homely virtues. - Ah. - Then he will be happier than ever. - [Narrator] So with much optimism, Lord Malmesbury's wise words of advice, and her own resolve to rise above jealous feelings, Caroline arrived in London and was met by her new lady-in-waiting, personally appointed by the Prince of Wales. - [Jersey] Welcome, your Highness. - Your Highness, may I present Lady Jersey. - Where is the Prince? - His Royal Highness has asked me to greet you personally. And to accompany you to Carlton House. But perhaps first you would to change your costume. I assume your Highness does not intend to be presented in your current attire? - Why, what's wrong with it? - I do think that this dress that I have brought for you is a little more subdued for the occasion. And may I suggest this turban, instead of your hat? - I like this hat. - I daresay, but not with this dress. [footsteps clicking] [door hinges clacking] [somber classical orchestral music] - Your Highness, may I present the Princess Caroline Amelia Elizabeth of Brunswick. - Harris, I'm not well, pray get me a glass of brandy. - Sir, had you better not have a glass of water? - Damn you, no, I will go directly to the Queen. [footsteps retreating] - Mein Gott, does the Prince always act like this? I think he's very rude. And he's nothing like as handsome as his portrait. - His Royal Highness is quite naturally very affected and flurried by this first interview. But I'm sure you'll find him quite different at dinner tonight, ma'am. [dishes clattering] - [Narrator] But dinner was not a great success. This time, it was the Princess whose behavior was not all that could be expected. - My father had a mistress, you know, in Brunswick. She was a beautiful woman, she had very, very red hair. And... [laughing] - [Narrator] Malmesbury was disappointed with his pupil. - [Harris Voiceover] The Princess was flippant, rattling, affecting raillery and wit, and throwing out coarse and vulgar hints about Lady Jersey, who was present. - Actually, she probably would have been about the same size as Lady Jersey, on top. [Caroline cackling] Yes, but she was a very attractive woman. Much more attractive than my mother. But apart from that, she was very, very-- - [Harris Voiceover] The Prince was evidently disgusted and this unfortunate dinner fixed his dislike of the Princess. Nothing she did improved matters, instead, her giddy manners and attempts at cleverness and coarse sarcasm increased his dislike until it became positive hatred. - Not really, are they? Mistresses, they don't seem to read very much. I think they're, you know, a bit slow. - [Narrator] So much for all of Malmesbury's hard work. [Caroline cackling] Three days later, they were married. - [Archbishop] And therefore is not by any to be enterprised lightly or wantonly, but reverently, discreetly, soberly-- - [Narrator] Alas, not altogether soberly. The Prince was somewhat tipsy, quite drunk, in fact. - George Augustus Frederick, wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded wife? Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honor and keep her in sickness and in health, and forsaking all other, keep thee only under her so long as ye both shall live? [ominous orchestral music] [someone coughing] Forsaking all other, keep thee only under her so long as ye both shall live? [suspenseful orchestral music] - I will. - [Archbishop] Caroline Amelia Elizabeth. - [Narrator] Why did the Archbishop repeat himself? - [Archbishop] Man for thy wedded husband. - [Narrator] Perhaps he, like some others in the congregation that day, knew that the Prince had a secret. - [Archbishop] In sickness and in health. - [Narrator] He was already married. - [Archbishop] Forsaking all other, keep thee only unto her so long as ye both shall live? - I will. - [Narrator] 10 years earlier, the 22-year-old George went through a secret ceremony with Maria Fitzherbert. He was passionately in love with her. It hadn't been easy to persuade her to marry him, but he pursued her unrelentingly, not just with soft words and flowers, but with his own blood. [Maria gasping] - I will not live unless you promise to be my wife, and permit me to put a ring around your finger. - [Narrator] As a devout Roman Catholic, Maria had refused to become George's mistress. But she knew she could never be his wife. Not legally, anyway, it was against the law for Catholics to marry future kings. But George refused to take no for an answer. How the Prince had got into this bloody state is debatable. He said that he'd stabbed himself with a sword. [George grunting] [sword clattering] But it was later rumored that he had just opened up an old wound and smeared the blood all over his chest. - Will you be my wife? - I will. - [Narrator] Oh well, however it happened, it did the trick with Mrs. Fitzherbert. The secret marriage last for 10 years. - [Archbishop] Thy blessing upon these, thy servant, this man-- - [Narrator] But by the time of his second wedding, George's affections had shifted, to Lady Jersey. - [Archbishop] Creator and Preserver of all mankind. - [Narrator] He was certainly a Prince of Hearts. - [Archbishop] Everlasting life, send thy blessing upon these, thy servant, this man and this woman. [romantic orchestral music] - [Narrator] Ah, the wedding night. [door hinges clacking] [romantic orchestral music] [thudding] [George snoring] Fortunately for the royal succession, next morning, George remembered his motto, ich dien, I serve. The Prince had done his duty, a royal heir was on the way. But there was never much of a honeymoon feeling around. - Good night, ma'am. - Good night. - [Narrator] Within two weeks, they had ceased to live together as man and wife. [doors thudding] - Malmesbury, you saw her at dinner tonight. How do like these manners? - I cannot approve of them, your Highness. But her father did tell me that she was often very high-spirited and careless. - As I see, why didn't you tell me all this before? You could have written to me from Brunswick. - Oh, it didn't seem of sufficient consequence at the time. And with respect, I must remind your Highness, I was sent to arrange a marriage, not to advise on the suitability of the bride. [George sighs] - [Narrator] Poor George, to make things worse, he never even saw the money he'd been promised. His creditors got there first, and he was now worse off than before. Still, neither marital nor financial problems changed the princely way of life. [chips clattering] [whimsical classical music] - From a Prince to a King. - And none too soon. [laughing] - [Narrator] But while the Prince continued as before, he kept the Princess on a tight rein. She was forbidden to see anyone without his approval, and the people he approved of were mostly very dull and very old. Apart from her chief lady-in-waiting. [dishes clattering] [clock chiming] George refused to dine with his wife. - I'd rather see toads and vipers crawl across my food than sit at the same table as that woman. - [Narrator] And spent as little time in her company as he possibly could. - [Caroline Voiceover] I do not know how I shall bear the loneliness. The Queen seldom visits me, and my sisters-in-law show me the same sympathy. The Lady Jersey is still here. I hate her, and I know she feels the same way towards me. My husband is wholly given up to her, so you can easily imagine the rest. - [Narrator] But the Princess was not entirely alone. She found some new friends, the newspapers. When the Times heard of her plight, it called her a state prisoner, and while her inattentive husband became ever more unpopular, public sympathy for Caroline grew, especially when nine months after the wedding, Princess Charlotte was born. [baby crying] Mother and child were in excellent health, but the father was certain he was dying. And so he wrote his will, listing all his worldly possessions and leaving them to-- - The wife of my heart and soul, my true and real wife, my second self, my beloved and adored Maria Fitzherbert. I entreat my adored Maria that whenever she quits this life, my coffin should be taken up and placed next to hers. And that the two inward sides of the coffins should be taken out and the two coffins then be soldered together. [George sobbing] She who is called the Princess of Wales wears jewels that are mine. I bequeath them to my infant daughter and to her who is called the Princess of Wales, I leave one shilling. [George moaning] - [Narrator] The Prince made a full recovery a few days later. By now, things were rather complicated in the palace. There weren't just two in this marriage, or even three, there were four. George made no secret of his relationships with both Jersey and Fitzherbert. For a year, Caroline had put up with her situation. But now, emboldened by being mother to the heir to the throne, she started to fight back. - [Caroline Voiceover] Sir, I wish to be excused from dining alone with a person whom I can neither like nor respect and who is your mistress. And to be shut up with her all the long day. Forgive me, my dear Prince, if my expressions are too strong, believe that it is a heart wounded by the most acute pain, the most deadly sorrow, that pleads for your help. - [George Voiceover] Madam, let me remind you that the intimacy of my friendship with Lady Jersey, my mistress, as you indecorously term her, was perfectly known to you before you accepted my hand, for you yourself told me so immediately on your arrival here. - [Caroline Voiceover] I deeply regret the coldness and great contempt of your conduct towards me. I only ask for your friendship, which would be very precious to me. [quill tapping] - [George Voiceover] Madam, if you wish for more of my company, you would do well not to make my own house obnoxious to me. [paper crunching] - [Caroline Voiceover] Sir, I wish to know the exact terms upon which we are in future to live, in particular, I want to be assured that you will never again, not even in the event of the death of our daughter, make any attempt to produce another heir. [paper crunching] - [George Voiceover] In the event of any accident happening to my daughter, I shall not infringe the terms of restriction by purposing at any period a connection of a more particular nature. [knocking] I shall now finally close this disagreeable correspondence, trusting that as we have completely explained ourselves to each another, the rest of our lives will be passed in uninterrupted tranquility. [paper rustling] - [Narrator] Tranquility was not to be. Caroline now wrote to the King who had always sympathized with his daughter-in-law and defended her against the Prince. The King ordered that Lady Jersey be removed from her service, a sweet victory for the Princess. And soon everybody knew, it was in all the papers. The Times reported that Lady Jersey's letter of resignation was one of the most disrespectful we ever recollect to have read. How did they get hold of it? No one knows. George's situation had become intolerable. His wife was more popular than he was. When she went out, people cheered. When he showed himself, he was hissed and booed. The crisis came when Caroline asked to visit friends in the country, the Prince refused. - There could be dangerous consequences if the Princess of Wales were to travel all over England, showing herself to the people, repeating her tricks. Especially if she persists in her artful and malicious conduct, drawing popularity to herself at the expense of myself and my family. [footsteps clacking] [somber orchestral music] - You wrote that you wished to see me, ma'am. - There is no point in any explanation. I have only two words to say to you. I've been 2 1/2 years in this house. You have treated me neither as your wife, nor as the mother of your child, nor as the Princess of Wales. I advise you that from this moment, I have nothing more to say to you and that I regard myself as being no longer subject to your orders or your rules. - Is that all you have to say, ma'am? - Yes. - [Narrator] And that was the last time the Prince of Wales spoke to the Princess. He demanded a formal separation. The King refused, but he allowed Caroline to move out of the palace. And so she went to a small house just outside London, in Blackheath, and found a whole new lease of life. [parrot squawking] - I'm coming to get you. [laughing] Where are you? - [Narrator] Dullness was a thing of the past. Now there were dinners and dancing, and plenty of gentlemen callers, war heroes, society painters, politicians, all celebrated, ambitious and eligible. - Oh! Yes, it's Sir Sidney. - [Narrator] Meanwhile George, having now extricated himself himself from Lady Jersey, wooed back his first wife. - Save me. Save me. On my knees, I conjure you from myself. If you wish my life, you shall have it. Oh, God! The wretched experiences of the last five years have made my life only desirable in one shape to me and that is in you. You know you are my wife. I will relinquish everything for you, rank, situation, birth. And if that is not sufficient, my life shall go also. Oh, my heart! My heart! My heart! [George sobbing] - [Narrator] Once again, George's methods were too powerful, or underhand, for Mrs. Fitzherbert to resist. But although he'd recaptured Maria's heart, he still couldn't win over the public's. - Listen to this. His unjust behavior to her, given his own most disgraceful connections, only adds to the opprobrium attaching to the heir to the throne. Have you ever heard such libels? Oh! Sent from Carlton House and separated from her child, everyone must pity the wife of an incorrigible wastrel, who, while our armies fight the French, flagrantly squanders public money on senseless frivolity. God, when I have pleaded with the King to let me lead an army against the French. - This will make you feel better. No one of taste, discernment or knowledge can do anything but deplore the gratuitous and ungenerous conduct of both the press and opposition against a Prince who has been and is a glory of the people, an Adonis of Loveliness. - What paper is that? - The Morning Post. - I own the Morning Post. [birds chirping] - [Narrator] For a few years, there was a truce. The Prince and Princess lived separate lives. But as these years went by, Caroline's lively behavior did not go unnoticed. - Sir Thomas Lawrence, the portrait painter, your Highness. I regret to say that he is not alone. - [Narrator] Lord Liverpool, the Home Secretary, is listing the names of those gentlemen alleged to have been on intimate terms with the Prince's wife at Blackheath. - George Canning, a colleague of mine, I'm afraid. Admiral Sidney Smith, a most distinguished war hero. Captain Thomas Manby, RN. And finally, the Honorable Henry Hood. - Who has so obligingly provided this list? - Sir John and Lady Douglas, neighbors of Her Highness's. If they're to be believed, her behavior has become extremely strange. She has sent Sir John an indelicate drawing. - Sir Sidney doing Lady Douglas, your amiable wife. - And there's something more, your Highness. - A bastard, she's had a bastard. [baby crying] - Oh William! [baby crying] Sweet William. - [Narrator] Sweet William's origins were uncertain. When Caroline came to Blackheath, she was forced to leave her daughter behind. Ever since, she had sought new objects for her affections. She began to collect children like her husband collected perfumes. She fostered eight local orphans, paying for their education and upkeep. But with the ninth, something different happened. William moved in. - Oh, I'm so happy. I'll never regret leaving all that and coming here. God, how I've suffered. It's just as well I'm so strong-minded or I'd never have survived it. I should have been the man, you know, and he should have been the woman. He knows exactly how a coat should be cut or how a dress should be made. Actually, he'd make an excellent tailor or hairdresser, but absolutely nothing else. [man chuckling] Isn't that right, William, oh give him to me. - [Narrator] There were rumors that William was Caroline's own child, an accusation too serious for the government to ignore. They ordered a private so-called Delicate Investigation. - Yes. - Mary Wilson went into the room to make up the fire and saw Her Highness and Sir Sidney in such an indecent situation. She was so shocked, she fainted away at the door. - She was with a naval officer, Your Honor, in a very compromising position. - [Hutchison] Was the man involved an Admiral? - Oh, I don't know, sir, he wasn't wearing his hat. Oh, and Samuel Roberts, the footman, told me that wasn't all. - [Hutchison] What did he say? - That the Princess was very fond of fucking, Your Honor. - She then told me she was going to have a baby of her own. She said no one would notice when it arrived. Everyone would just assume it was another foster child. She said no one would know she was pregnant. She'd arrange cushions under her clothes, and everyone would assume she was just growing fat. - [Hutchison] Did she say who the father was? - No, but she said if she was discovered, she would give the Prince of Wales the credit for it. - I heard that the Princess sometimes adopted poor children, so I took him to Blackheath. They told me he would be brought up and treated like a young prince. So I agreed to leave him here. I'm really grateful for all the Princess has done for us. - [Narrator] Once William's real mother came forward, the Delicate Investigation had to conclude that the child was not Caroline's, and it couldn't prove adultery, either. The Prince was disappointed. There were no grounds for a Royal divorce. Years went by, and Caroline and George continued their separate lives. But whereas he lived the grand life of royalty, she became more and more isolated. Ignored by the Royal Family and bored by the life she was forced to lead, she became increasingly outrageous. - Such an exhibition! But that she did not feel for herself, one should have felt for her! Such an over-dressed, bare-bosomed, painted eye-browed figure one never saw. - She is always seeking amusement and unfortunately, often at the expense of propriety and prudence. - Her conversation is uncommonly lively, odd and clever. What a pity she has not a grain of common sense, nor an ounce of ballast to prevent high spirits. - Every day, she becomes more imprudent in her conduct, more heedless of society. The poor Princess is going on headlong to her ruin. [quiet orchestral music] - That wicked Princess on the heath, she is such a rake and such a rioter, and such an irregular person, that she makes rebellions and mutinies in every well-regulated house. [laughing] - [Narrator] While Caroline ran riot, her father-in-law the King was slowly going mad. When he was finally declared insane, the Prince became Regent and immediately used his new powers to restrict Caroline's access to her daughter. - I have drafted a letter to your husband, your Highness. Cut off from one of the few domestic enjoyments left to me, the society of my child. - [Narrator] This is Henry Brougham, Ambitious Scots lawyer, rising Opposition politician. He gave the Princess's cause direction. She made him famous. - Or by secret insinuation. There is a point beyond which a guiltless woman cannot with safety carry her forebearance onwards, but must resort to whatever mean possible to protect herself. - [Narrator] The letter was published in the Morning Chronicle. - Damn her, the order stands. She shall see her once a fortnight and no more. - [Narrator] The private arguments of the Prince and Princess of Wales. A not uninteresting subject for breakfast reading. A pleasant change from, say, the Third Reading of the Naval Arsenals Bill. And it was Brougham and his friends who made sure that no editor was ever short of the latest details. [footsteps clacking] The press and the public loved Caroline, but high society kept its distance. When the crowned heads of Europe came to London to mark the victory over Napoleon, the Prince held some grand celebrations. Everyone who was anyone was invited. Well, almost. - [Caroline Voiceover] Sir, of all His Highness's subjects, I alone am prevented from appearing in my proper place to partake of the general joy. - [Narrator] It was the final humiliation. - So ma'am, you're leaving. - What should I stay here for? I've no life here. He deprives me of my position as Princess of Wales, of being the mother of his child. I'm ignored by everyone. I live in my little nutshell like a hermit. - There are many who support you here, including myself. - Pooh, Mr. Brougham. The cause you are most interested in is your own. I am a stick to beat your political enemies with, no more or no less. You do it for your party, not for me. - If you go, ma'am, there will be many people encouraging the Prince to divorce you. If you're abroad, we cannot protect you or keep the public on your side. - I don't know which of you gives me more trouble, my friends or my enemies! I'm tired, Mr. Brougham. I'm tired of being managed by you and I'm tired of this life, which cannot get any better until I leave this vile country! [glasses clinking] - To the Princess of Wales, damnation, and may she never return to England. - [Narrator] George celebrated with his latest amour. Mrs. Fitzherbert had a last gone the way of Lady Jersey. Now it was the turn of Lady Hertford to act as his confidante. [couple laughing] Once Caroline started traveling, she couldn't stop. For six years, she traveled. It was like the best days of Blackheath all over again. She had all the freedom she wanted. There was dancing and parties and no one there to tell her what wear or what to do. - Are you quite sure you wish to hear all this, your Highness? - Go ahead, Liverpool, I am quite prepared. - [Narrator] Lord Liverpool was now Prime Minister with a country to run and an Empire to nurture. His most pressing duty, however, was to keep the Prince informed of his wife's adventures. - At Geneva, she appeared at a ball dressed as Venus. - So? - That is, not dressed further than the waist. Lord Redesdale reports from Baden that she attended the Grand Duke's hunting ball, with half a pumpkin on her head. She told him it was the coolest sort of coiffure. At Genoa, she was drawn through the streets in a mother-of-pearl carriage wearing pink boots with plenty of stout leg showing. And there's a letter from Lady Bessborough in Milan. She writes, I cannot tell you how sorry and ashamed I felt as an Englishwoman to see Her Highness in a little girl's white dress with a neck very low, disgustingly so. - Enough, I've heard enough! Put someone to watch her, Liverpool. And make this an official enquiry. This time, I will get a divorce. - One name appears regularly. He is called Pergami, Bartolemeo Pergami. Old Italian family, fallen on hard times. Has the manners of a gentleman, started as her valet, promoted to chamberlain, now eats at her table. Most of his relatives seem to be on the staff, too. Mother, sisters, nephews. - More, Liverpool, we need more. - She entered Jerusalem on an ass, with some 200 followers. Whilst there, she founded the Order of Saint Caroline. As its Grand Master, she then appointed Count Bartolomeo Pergami, Baron of Francina, Knight of Malta and the Holy Sepulchre. Your Highness, may I express my deepest condolences on the truly tragic loss of your daughter. - [Narrator] Princess Charlotte, married only a year before, had died giving birth to a stillborn child. She was 19. - Get on with it. - In Sicily, Princess Caroline has had herself painted as a penitent Magdalene, with her hair disordered, eyes heavenwards, naked to the waist. She has apparently given the picture to Pergami. There is now evidence from some 85 persons which appears to confirm the fact of a continued and adulterous intercourse between her Royal Highness and Pergami. They are to all appearances man and wife. Never was anything so obvious. - Excellent. - Your Majesty, may I express my sincerest condolences on the death of your esteemed father. The country has lost a most-revered and honored sovereign. But has gained a most-respected and truly worthy successor. - Does she know? - I am informed she is already on her way to London. - She must be stopped, stop her. - [Narrator] Caroline was intercepted just before she reached Calais. - Mr. Brougham, what a surprise! - Your Majesty, may I present Lord Hutchison, a representative of His Majesty's government. - [Hutchison] Your Majesty. - And who is it you represent, Mr. Brougham? - As always, Your Majesty, I'm here to protect your interests. Lord Hutchison has some serious proposals. - Well, be quick, I have a boat waiting. - It is hereby agreed by her Majesty Caroline Amelia Elizabeth-- - Yes yes, my Lord, the figures, how much? - 50,000 pounds per annum. - Oh, payable for my entire life? - Absolutely, Your Majesty. - With what conditions? - Take you take another title. - The government is generous. Another title, as well as Queen? - Instead of Queen. - What they are proposing, Your Majesty, is Duchess of Cornwall. - Oh. Would I have to live there? - No, ma'am. - So I could live in London? - No. The proposal is-- - Yes, my Lord, I guess the proposal. That I don't come to England now, or ever. You think I don't know this the minute I see you? What will they do, if I do come? - His Majesty may try to divorce you. They have much damaging evidence against you. - And I have much against him. - Your Majesty, do not be precipitous. - If you accept these proposals, ma'am, you could have an agreeable and peaceful life. - I don't want a peaceful life, I won't go quietly. I have endured a great deal to become Queen of England and that is what I shall be. - [Liverpool] I'm afraid she was cheered all the way from Dover, Your Majesty. At Canterbury, some 10,000 people awaited her. [George coughing] - Has Brougham told you what she wants? - She still insists that her name be included in the prayers for the Royal Family. - Put her name in the liturgy, never! - And that she attend the coronation. - Attend, attend! You mean, be crowned? Be crowned beside me? - Yes, Your Majesty. - Then cancel it, cancel it! I will not be crowned with that woman beside me. I will be divorced first. - As Your Majesty knows, the procedure is uncertain. - I don't care! Find a new procedure then, Liverpool. Arrange it, or I'll find myself a new Prime Minister and a government that will. I will be divorced! - [Narrator] The queen's unexpected arrival also excited the public. Mobs roamed the streets, windows were smashed, and the cry everywhere was for the Queen. Something had to be done and the government came up with a solution. - They've issued a Bill of Pains and Penalties, Your Majesty. - A Bill of Pains and Penalties. It sounds as if I should be fried and tortured. What does it mean? - The Bill goes first to the Lords, then to the Commons. If it's passed, it will strip you of your title and dissolve your marriage. It's a cunning device. Effectively, you'll be on trial. Witnesses will be called and cross-examined. - We will call the King. - With this procedure, ma'am, one can't. He won't even be named as plaintiff. Your reputation will be on trial, but not your husband's. - The Queen on trial, no! - Oh no! - I don't believe it! - Surely not! - Well, well! - [Both Women] No! - My Lords, the highest individual in the land is charged with one of the most serious offenses both against God and man, adulterous intercourse. I am aware, my Lords, of the reluctance with which your Lordships must listen to these disgusting details. - [Narrator] Maybe not that reluctant. The House of Lords was packed to hear the Attorney General, Sir Robert Gifford's opening attack on the Queen. - I shall now proceed to call my first witness. Teodoro Majocchi. - Teodoro. Teodoro! - [Narrator] Things didn't start well for Caroline. Teodoro was one of her most trusted servants. If he testified against her, who could she rely on? - Do you remember Pergami at Messina asking leave of the Princess to go and make some purchases? - I do. - Describe what took place when they parted from each other for that purpose. - I saw Pergami say, will your Royal Highness permit me to go to Messina to make some purchases? And having had this permission, he took her hand and kissed her lips. - Did they dine there by themselves? - They were alone. - [Gifford] Where was the Princess sitting? - On the bed. - Where was Pergami sitting? - On the ground, at the feet of her Royal Highness. - Did her Majesty sleep under that tent on the whole journey from Jaffa? - She slept always under that tent. - Did anybody else sleep under the same tent? - Bartolomeo Pergami. - [Narrator] Majocchi seemes less sure of events when cross-examined by Brougham on behalf of the queen. - Did you ever see William Austin sleep under the tent? [speaking in a foreign language] - [Narrator] He did not remember. - And where did Captain Hannan sleep? [speaking in a foreign language] - And where did the Countess Oldi sleep? [speaking in a foreign language] - [Narrator] Majocchi failed to remember not once, not twice, not even 10 times. On 83 occasions, he stated that his memory failed him. A small triumph for Brougham. But Majocchi was not the only servant of the Princess's to testify against her. Over the weeks that followed, the prosecution called 85 of her former employees and most of their evidence was damaging. - Did you notice anything about Pergami's hand? - Yes, it was in her dress. - Where, precisely? - Under her skirt. - And her Majesty's hand? - In his trousers, on his [speaking in a foreign language] [speaking in a foreign language] - Parte privato. - We understand. - Once, when I made the bed, I noticed the sheets were in disorder. - What do you mean by that? - It had... Stains. - [Gifford] What sort of stains? - As much as I have seen, they were white. - You have stated you are a married woman. What did those stains appear to be? - I won't stand for it. - [Narrator] Outside the House of Lords, the country was obsessed with the trial. The Times, a loyal supporter of the Queen doubled it's circulation. People talked of little else. - Well, is she so bad? - He's worse. - If my husband had treated me like he has her, I should have thought myself entitled to act as she has. - After all this, how impossible it will be for any man to divorce his wife for the next 20 years. - My husband prevents me reading the newspaper. He merely reads out the elements he considers suitable. - [Narrator] Every day, there were demonstrations for the Queen, large and small. Petitions were handed to her by bakers, glass workers, brass founders, and seamen. The married ladies of Edinburg collected over 8,000 signatures. - We most sincerely lament the harsh and unprecedented usage which Your Majesty has received. The principles now advanced by your accusers do not apply to your case alone, but may be applied hereafter as a precedent by every careless and dissipated husband to rid himself of his wife, however good and innocent she may be, rendering all domestic felicity uncertain. - Did you receive money to come here today and give this evidence? - I received nothing else but my traveling expenses. - What bargain have you made? What pay are you to have for coming here? - [Narrator] Brougham's main line of attack against the witnesses was to suggest that they had all been bribed to testify against the Queen. It was a defense that fed well off British bigotry. - John Bull regards these Italians as so many bugs and frogs. What we want is proof witnesses, credible ones, 10 Englishmen instead of a hundred Italians. - [Gifford] And you saw no degradation-- - [Narrator] For more than three months, Caroline sat in the Lords', hearing her character blackened. George, meanwhile, hid himself in Windsor Castle. But he couldn't hide his dubious reputation. Brougham made sure that it was uppermost in everyone's minds, and Mr. Brougham's powers of persuasion proved decisive. - I am not, because of the form of this bill, allowed to ask the prosecution who their client is. If I knew, I could bring forward documents and speeches without number against him. But I am allowed to know nothing about this mysterious being, this uncertain phantom, this uncertain shape. If I could see it, I might interrogate it and bring out of its mouth, if it has a mouth, who and what it is. And whether it be a man or some other-- - Why did you withdraw the bill? - There was no alternative, Your Majesty. - But you won the final vote. - Only by nine votes, too small a majority to risk going to the Commons with. We simply didn't dare chance our luck there. [fireworks popping] - [Narrator] It looked as though the Queen had won. Her supporters seemed to think so. For five nights, they rejoiced. But one person wasn't celebrating. Caroline had been acquitted, but her reputation had been destroyed. [Caroline sobbing] She knew her victory was a hollow one. [sad classical orchestral music] But she wasn't finished yet. There were palaces, money, and titles to fight for, and she was determined to get what she wanted. The King ignored her. He suspected that her support was fading, and he had better things to do. He was planning a Coronation, for one. - The Queen, being particularly anxious to submit to the good taste of His Majesty, most earnestly entreats the King to inform the Queen in what dress he wishes her to appear on the day of the Coronation. - Issue instructions that she is not under any circumstances to appear. Now, let us think about the shoes. Velvet, with tassels, and embroidered in gold and silver thread. - [Narrator] On the morning of the Coronation, Caroline arrived at the door of Westminster Abbey with her loyal supporter, Lord Hood. - Your ticket, please, madam. - I present you Queen to you. Surely it is not necessary for her to have a ticket? - Our orders are to admit no one without a peer's ticket. - This is your Queen. She is entitled to admission without such a ticket. - Yes, I am your Queen, will you not admit me? - My orders are specific and I feel myself bound to obey them. No one is allowed to enter without a ticket. - Will Your Majesty take my ticket and go in alone? - No, I will enter as Queen, and without a ticket. - Am I to understand that you are refusing her Majesty admission? - I only act in conformity with my orders. - I am sorry for it. - [Narrator] It was to be Caroline's last act of defiance. As she walked away, people shouted, go back to Pergami. The public who had supported her for more than 20 years had finally deserted her. [choir and organ music] There's nothing like a good Coronation to win over the people, and won over they were by the Royal extravaganza. George's outfit alone cost the country 24 thousand, 704 pounds, eight shillings, and 10 pence. Two weeks after the Coronation, Caroline collapsed. The doctors diagnosed a blockage of the bowel and gave her enough castor oil, according to Brougham, to turn the stomach of a horse. It's likely she had stomach cancer. - I'm going to die, Mr. Brougham. But it doesn't matter. - Your physicians were of quite a different opinion, Your Majesty. - I know better than them. I do not wish to be buried here. I want to be buried in Brunswick. They did not like my young bones, so they shan't have my old ones. I don't die without pain. But I die without regret. - [Narrator] George was on his way to Ireland when he heard of his wife's death. He paced around his cabin most of the night and had all the flags lowered as a sign of mourning. The next day, his 59th birthday, he arrived in Dublin, apparently in great spirits, and dead drunk. [thudding] On the day of the funeral, Caroline's friends carried out her final wish. Caroline of Brunswick, The Injured Queen of England. 25 years before, when Lord Malmesbury brought Caroline over from Brunswick, he said of her, in the hands of a sensible man who loved her, she would probably turn out well. But then her own father had said, the heart has nothing to do with Royal marriages. [mournful classical orchestral music]
