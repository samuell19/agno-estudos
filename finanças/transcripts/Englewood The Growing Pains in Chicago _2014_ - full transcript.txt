Take that hat off in my building. - [Dennis] It's the end of Senior year and Mr. Jefferson is still taking his $8.50 an hour way too seriously. To be honest, I didn't think I was gonna even make it to Senior year. Now that I think about it, I might not even make it past today. (tape rewinding) These two guys right here are like brothers to me. The one to your left is Calvin. His parents died in a car accident, so he had to move to his grandma's house in the South side of Chicago. The guy to your right is Josh. Well he's the only person I know in the hood with both parents. (rap music) - Hey D, what are you doing, man? - Hey man, get out of the fucking dice game, G. - Hold on, hold on, G, damn. - Man, get your ass out the dice game before you get whooped! - What you doing, man, it's eight o'clock. - Man, I'm out here getting this money, man, what you doing? - [Calvin] I'm on my way to class where you need to be going. Come on, man! - Roll the dice, nigga. - Man, I'm gonna take care of you in a minute. All right, you go to class and I'm gonna catch up, all right? Hey Josh! Where you going, man?! Man, come over here and get this money, man! It's sweet out here today, I'm telling you. I came up about $100. - Nah man, I can't. - [Dennis] You lame, G! (mumble)... Look man, coach talking about putting me on the bench 'cause I keep missing first period. Dude, they tell me my college scout's supposed to be there. This could be my shot, man. - [Dennis] Fuck outta here, man. Slap it on the 10. Coach be talking all that scout shit to pump our heads up, man. Ain't nobody coming to see you, Josh! Nigga, you think you gonna be on TV hoopin' like D. Rose? - Trying to. - Get real, that nigga had parents at every game. Coaches that helped him progressively get better, right? Who we got, huh? Who we got? Nobody! You feel me? - [Voiceover] (mumble) - Nobody. - (mumble) - [Dennis] Hey nobody smoke around here, man, get your ass outta here, boy! Hey man, you better stop dreaming and get this money. Hoo! Broke your ass, boy! - Your boy here stepped on my motherfucking dice game (mumble) that's all right. - Man, please, nigga, you broke. - Hey don't listen to his bitter ass. - Bitter? - Bitter. - I just speak the truth, man. You know, I'm a realist. Sorry everybody ain't spoiled as shit like Calvin, you feel me? - I'm not spoiled. I just like to do what's right. When you do good, good things come back to you. - What, and that's in your world? - The world! - Whatever, hey, you keep listening to this nigga, you gonna be broke, I'm telling you. - Come on man, it ain't like that (mumble). Look around. What you see good coming out of where we from? - Josh, man, you got a lot of potential, man. Don't blow it. - Man, that's a good game you got on you, boy. Better keep hoopin', man, that's gonna take you some places, trust me. Fuck all this bullshit out here, man, that's where it's at. - Josh! It's not about where you from. It's about where you going. Remember that. - Fuck are you talking about, man?! Man, you trip, here, smoke this. - Get it out of my face, man! (laughing) - [Dennis] Fuck outta here, man. - What you do, reading a book all night with quotes in it, come back and fill our heads with this stuff? That's what you be on? I'm going to class 'cause he tweaking. - Hey wait up! Wait up. Calvin and I had different views on the world. You see, he comes from a place called false hope and I'm not gonna let him brainwash me nor Josh. Some people call me a bad influence or something, but hey, I don't care. - That piece was written by Doctor Maya Angelou. Amercian Literature is all about expression. The pen allows one to convey every thought from mind to reality. Groups of people coming together often find it a form of escape. - Like music, right? - Exactly, yeah, music absolutely is a form of escape as well, and not only the lyrics, but the instruments as well. So class, your assignment was for each of you to bring in a piece of writing. A quote, a poem, or even something you've written yourself and perform it for the class. It should be something that speaks to your current situation. So who would like to go first? Great, Angie, why don't you come on up? - Okay, my name is Angie and I like long walks on the beach, holding hands on the rain-- - [Johnson] Okay, all right, get on with it. - Okay, I'm just joking. But for real, this is something I wrote about two days ago, I call it Dreaming of You. I hope y'all like it. (clears throat) Every night, I rush to my bed with hopes that maybe I see your face when I close my eyes. I'm going out of my head, lost in a fairytale. I'm sorry, Ms. Johnson, this is hard for me. - [Johnson] No, you're doing great. - Can you hold my hand and be my guide? Clouds filled with stars cover your skies. And hope it rains. You're the perfect lullaby. What kind of dream is this? - Okay, so does that speak to anyone or anything in particular? - Man, that ain't her poem, that's Beyonce's Beautiful Nightmare. - Man, shut up! It speaks to my situation and Ms. Johnson and Calvin said that it's just like music! Man, forget y'all! You talk too much. - Okay, okay. All right, who's next? Mr. Anderson? Mr. Anderson! - D! - Are you prepared with your assignment? Mr. Anderson. - What assignment? - Dennis, I'm sorry to have to remind you that one more failed class from anyone on your team and that forfeits the game. Do you want that kind of responsibility? - D, look man, I know you don't care, man, just do something for the team. Don't matter what it is, just go. Come on, man, just do something. - Life is a struggle filled with pain. I can't see some of the sunny days because of all of the rain. I do this poetry, like Ms. Johnson said. I can release my pain. Sometimes this life is a messed up road. Sometimes you happy, sometimes you sad. But you definitely cry more times in your life. I wonder when this pain will ever end. In a world this crazy and filled with sin. If I do this poetry, I can pretend. And my pain will surely end. What are friends? Something I've never known. What is peace? Something I'll never know. What is love? Something I'm never shown. I would even like to know what Heaven is. I guess when I'm done here in Hell I can call it home. - Wow. Was that an original piece or... - No, just something I wrote. I mean no. I got that from a Lil Wayne CD or something. Think I write like that? Nah, Dawg. - Hey man, that don't even matter. That was hot, kid. - Yeah, nice poem. Or song, or whatever. - Come on, Calvin, 'cause you can't beat your grandmama. See, I told you, you can't beat me. - Whatever, it ain't over, it ain't over. - It ain't over? There it is right there. Boy, I done beat you again! - You only beat me 'cause I'm tired. - Okay, excuses excuses, you can't beat your grandmama, I don't care how much you try, you can't. - Well we'll have to see some other time, I'm about to hit the sack right now. - What?! - That's enough for me. - Calvin! - I love you. - Baby, wait a minute, let's play one more. 'Cause grandma wanna talk to you for a minute, sit down. - All right, what you wanna talk about? - It's about your friend Dennis. - What about him? - I think you should put some distance between the two of you. Just for a little while. Calvin, Dennis is trouble, baby. And if you keep hanging with him, you gonna find yourself in a heap of mess you not gonna be able to get out of. - He's not trouble. And I'm not gonna get into any mess. He just needs help like everybody else. - Yeah. - Right? - Yeah, that may be true, but he may need more help than you can afford to give him right now. Now did you ask that boy to come go to church with us? - Yeah, a couple times. - That's all you can do. I just need you to focus on graduating and applying to those colleges. Leave all this other foolishness alone. Can you do that for grandma? - You're right, granny, I hear you. - I hope so. - Will do. - Now after I beat you again, then you can get yourself some sleep. - All right, come on, one more. - Okay. - You ain't gonna win this time. - We gonna see. - All right. - I did teach you how to play though, so you might beat me, I don't know, let's see. (laughs) - What up, Josh? - D, come on, man! - What you (mumble)? Hey who is that?! Angie, that you, Angie? - Man, get out, stupid! - What's up, Angie! Angie, what's up? I want some! - [Angie] Get out! He's so stupid! Why you laughing?! (laughs) - Dennis, man, he's stilly. - Nah, you silly! I'm naked under your covers, your boy's coming in laughing, and you laugh right along with 'em! - Look, I'm naked up under here too, what you want me to do? - I want you to get up and lock the door! Act like you care, show me some kind of respect! - Hey, that's Angelia, yo. - You need to chill, man. - Man, shut up, that's Angelia in there. She didn't let me hit. - It's none of your business, man. - Whatever, I'll (mumble). - This guy never learns. - Get away. - What? - That's Calvin and Dennis, you know them though. - Oh, so because I know them I want your boys in the bed with us? Wait, you told me everybody was asleep. If everybody sleeping, how'd they get in, Josh? - I don't even know, man. Look, you acting like they gonna come in here and bite you. I mean if you into that thing, baby. - Don't play with me! You know I'm not like that. - I don't know nothing. You trippin' right now. - Toya tried to tell me about you. - Toya. - I just couldn't listen. - Man, you talking about the same Toya that's into Dennis? - What?! - Yeah. - Man, I don't know nothing about that, but what I do know is I'm about to be out of here. - I don't even know why you still sitting here talking to me. Hurry up and get your stuff. Don't wake nobody up neither on your way out! - Move, fool! - What up, Angie? - [Angie] Get off of me! - Josh, what up, boy?! - [Josh] What up, D? - Chillin', man. - Man, you bogus, man. - Look here! - [Josh] Man, she bogus. - Hey, wasn't that Toya's cousin? - I don't know who cousin that was. I know she got that good though, you feel me? (laughing) - Hey, don't tell that to Calvin. You know he's celibate. Saving himself for marriage, saving himself for Keisha! (laughing) - Aw man, whatever, man. Just because I choose to stay loyal to my girl and I ain't out here just screwing everything in sight like you two, what, that supposed to mean I'm some kind of punk or something? - Hey, you're starting to be a man, that don't make you no punk, bro. That just make you a virgin. (laughing) - Get out of here, man! What about you, Mr. Funny Man? - What about me? - I mean we don't ever see you with anybody. - [Dennis] What? - Yeah, nobody. I mean you see my girls. We both know Josh got plenty of girls. But we don't ever see you with anybody, man. What's the problem, huh? D? You pitching for the wrong team, man? Is that what it is? I mean 'cause you can tell us, man, we ain't gonna judge you. - That's 'cause I'm out here getting money. And your (mumble) tricks out here. (laughing) - Yeah, I'm sure, that's it. - Hey man, fuck y'all! - [Josh] Your man, he's serious. - Bad choice in words, man. - Mr. Funny Man. You have no idea what I go do, Prince Calvin. Always talking that love shit, huh? I'm gonna leave that love shit to you and Keisha. But don't come running to me or that nigga over there when she fuck you over! - Calm down, man! - Man, fuck you! - What's the problem with you? - [Josh] Man, y'all cool out. - [Calvin] What's with him? - [Josh] Let's go to the gym. - Come on, man, let's go. Now he be trippin' off. (rap music) - Let's go! 20, come on, push that up! That's what I'm talking about. Good set, bro. Hey, your boy Calvin got some hands on him. - Yeah he do. - You better stop fucking with him before he whoop your ass. - What?! Yeah, all right, believe it if you want to. - Hey fellas. - [Josh] What's up, Keish? - Man, what's his problem? - Don't worry about him. He just having a bad day. - Hey man, I'm about to get out of here. - Hey, I'm gonna leave with you, I got a date. - Who you taking out with no car? - Nobody, she taking me out on her car. She play out of college where I might (mumble) on the team too. (laughing) Hey, you know I'm Chi-town's finest, boy! Hey later, Keish. - See ya, Josh. - Let me feel it. Let me fee it, come on. Let me feel it. Come on, come on, that's all right, keep going. Yeah, that's it, come on. Yeah, I see, one two three, come on. Again, one two three. Come on, one two three, there you go. Come on, one two three. All right, one two roll two three. There you go, one two roll two three. There you go, come on. One two roll two three. (phone buzzing) - Hello? - What up, boy? - What's up, man? Josh told me why you was tripping earlier. Is everything cool? - Yeah, I'm cool. Just rough out here, man. Ended up punching his clock. The landlord talking about kicking a nigga out. - Whoa. Is it a money issue? Need some help, man? - Nah, I'm good. I'm out here working on it right now. Shit, ain't nobody out here. I don't know what I'm gonna do, bro. Shit rough. Hey, let me hit you back, bro. - Okay. - Is everything okay, Calvin? - I hope so. (dramatic music) Bitch, you know what this is, don't be stupid! - Please, young man, just take whatever you want, please! - I want everything you got in this motherfucker! - [Driver] That's all I have is my rent money! That's all I have! - I don't give a fuck! Now it's my rent money. Don't be stupid! Shit! - God, please! (sobs) Oh my God! - [Dennis] Ever since I was a young boy, I always felt like I had to take care of my mama. The older I got, she would depend on me more and more to do things I guess my father should've been around to do. I got money by any means. Because I don't wanna be the second man to hurt my mom. - Hey ma. - Hey, baby. - Ma, what you doing washing dishes? I thought I told you I was gonna do that for you when I got home? - Well I figured you'd be tired once you left school and practice and everything. I'm good. - Are you sure? - Yes, Josh! - Okay, mama. - Now go on, get in the tub 'cause your dinner's in the oven. - All right. Ma, you sure you're okay? Wash this last dish for you? - Go on, boy! So silly. - Hey mom. - Yeah, baby? - Any mail come for me today? - You still looking for that letter from that coach, that guy, what's his name? - Coach K, ma! - Oh excuse me, what's the big deal? - Oh no big deal, you know, only that this guy happens to be the coach of a Division One college who also coaches the U.S.A. Olympic Team. - Really? - And, he got interested in me, so I'm playing for him. - Oh excuse me, Mr. Superstar. The mail's sitting on the table, baby. - Thanks, ma. - You're welcome. I tell you, this boy all leaving his stuff in my kitchen. - 'Sup, man? - 'Sup, pop. - Anything good? - Nope, not yet. - Well... Since you ain't paying no bills around here, why don't I let you know if anything came for you? - Come on, pop. Coach told me there was a lot of scouts at the game last week. Said some of 'em might be interested in me and I should be looking for a letter in the mail, that's all. - Well last time I checked, he don't pay no bills around here neither. Now I said I'll let you know. - Whatever, man. - Hey, baby. - John! - What?! - Why do you treat him like that? - Like what? That boy needs to stop dreaming and go get a job like I did when I was his age. He needs to understand what I go through every day! And I'll tell you something else too. - What? - I hope like hell he don't expect me to pay for him to go to some big college neither. - See, that's the thing, Senior, he's not you! He's a good kid with a bright future! And you would know that if you were more involved in his life and focused on his future rather than always complaining about how much of an expense he is! - Oh okay, so that's how it is now?! Oh it's like that now, huh?! - Like what?! - You my wife, right? - Yes, Senior. - Through thick and thin, right? 'Till death do us part, right? - Yes, Senior, so?! - So you gonna take another man's side over mine! - What?! I ain't got time for this. - Don't you turn your back on me! Do you know how many women I coulda had when we were growing up? That's right, I said it! When you was pregnant with Josh I could've left and ran off with any one of 'em! But I stayed. And you gonna take another man's side over mine. - He's your son, Senior! - No, what he is is a man first! And you put his ass before me. - Senior! - Let me get a little drink. That's what's up. 'Sup, D? - Shit, you got all the candles lit, you got the music playing, what, you setting the mood? - You know how I do when I'm in my zone. - [Dennis] Okay. I feel you. What you (mumble) watching? - Psh, something on TV, I don't know. Why you over there eating? I know you done made mama some money! - I made me some money. - The fuck you mean made you some money?! Boy, you better quit playing with me. You know there's bills to be paid up in here. 'Cause dude been all over my ass for the rent! And this cable your ass watching, that ain't free. Quit playing. - [Dennis] Man, I have school and practice. I ain't had time. - Who give a fuck about a school, always bills to be paid up in here. D-Money my ass. More like D-Broke. - What? You sound crazy. - Your ass sound broke as hell! (muttering) There's bills to paid around here. Aw hell yeah! D-Money! See, that's what I'm talking about! You wanna hit this? - Hell yeah. - Don't get that grease all over my blunt either. Now I can go pay this rent, pay this cable bill! Oh no, hell nah, I gotta get my shoes, some (mumble) this weekend, woo! Yeah buddy! - Your ass always going out! - You know how I do. - Hey, where (mumble)? Hey where Didi at, I bought her some food. - Her little badass in her room. Didi! - [Didi] Huh?! - Your brother wants you. - Hey, what's up, Didi? What your little badass in there doing? I got you some food, you want it? - Yeah, I hope this shit ain't (mumble). - Hey, watch your goddamn mouth! See, that's the reason why you getting your ass sent home from school now every goddamn day! I don't know where you getting that shit from and quit fucking laughing! Where my food at? Over here laughing. Aw hell no! Dennis, that motherfucker at fucking (mumble) ain't put no mayo sause on my shit! I told yo ass six wings, Minute pepper and heavy on the mayo sauce, this shit dry as hell! Fuck (mumble) eat this. - What, you don't want it? - You know I'm gonna eat this shit! (laughing) I'm madder than a motherfucker, but I'm gonna eat it. And let me find out your ass cussing again I'm gonna fuck you up! Just make no damn sense. - Here, babe. - That's a lot, baby. I appreciate it. - So have you decided yet? - On what, the college? - Yeah, what else? - Choosing a college is not like choosing a pair of shoes, Keisha. I mean this is one of the most important decisions that I'm ever gonna make in my life. It's very important to me that I make the right one. - You're absolutely right. This decision is very important. And it's not my intentions to rush you into a haste one. I just wanna be a part of your decision, that's all, Calvin. - Keisha, we've been together for three years. What makes you think that you're not gonna be a part of my decision? What, you think that when I go up to college we're not gonna be together? - Out of sight out of mind, right? - How could you say that? What's all this talk about us not being together? You wanna break up? - No, I love you. - And you're confusing me, Keisha! First you tell me that you don't want to pursue my boxing career full time and that I should go off to college. Now you're acting like you're in fear of me going to college because you think we might break up. What's going on, Keisha? - You're confused? - Yes. - Well then that makes the two of us. You're so focused on boxing and going off to school that we don't have time to talk about our future together. And that scares me because I don't even think you see me in your future, Calvin. - Keisha, I want you to listen to me. When my parents died, I lost a lot of my faith and my trust in God. I didn't know how I was gonna deal with it. Honestly, I was thinking about ending it all, you know? And you helped me through that. I thank God every day for you and your love for me and for you having the courage to stick by me. Through all my pain and my trust issues and my insecurities. Keisha, I don't even see a future without you. - Calvin, I'm just afraid. - You don't have anything to be afraid of, Keisha. I'll never leave you. - That's just it. Calvin, it's not just me anymore. - Come here. Come here. It'll be all right. - Okay guys, so I hope you brought your reading material because I wanted to go over some more of Doctor Angelou's poems with you today, I was hoping... (sigh) Nice of you to join us, Mr. Anderson. Mr. Anderson! I'd like you to please join me at the front of the class. Just... Open your books and start the reading please. I'd like to know what your problem is. - I don't have one. - Dennis, obviously there's a problem. You don't come to my class, when you do you're asleep. I don't know how you think you're gonna make it through the end of the semester coming into class late every single day. All right, Dennis, you know what? I'm sorry, but in my opinion you're trying to make a mockery out of the entire school system and I'm not gonna let you distract these kids any longer. Dennis, you're not welcome in this class anymore, okay? I want you to take this note, I want you to take it to the principal's office. I wanna schedule a parent teacher conference with you tomorrow. - Are you serious? A mockery of the school system. Well Ms. Johnson, I think the school system is making a mockery of us. - Oh yeah? Please, do tell. - Well first off 90% of the stuff that's taught, we'll never use. You guys walk around here trying to act like our parents telling us what to wear and how to wear it, but last time I checked, you never gave me a dime for any of my school clothes. Now you get upset because I'm late, right? Have you ever offered me a ride to school? No? I didn't think so. - That's not my job, and you are way out of line. - You know what, that's not your job. Neither is being a dictator or a hypocrite, but you seem to be pulling that off quite well, right? - Get the hell out of this class right now and don't come back without your parent or a guardian. - Whatever. I guess I won't be back then 'cause she's not coming. But you can give her a call though. - [Ms. Johnson] Get out! - Ms. Johnson... Dennis? Dennis! - What?! - I just wanted to say that I agree with everything that you were saying back there. - And? - And graduation is coming up soon. - And? - And if you don't pass her class you're not gonna graduate! - I got news for you, Toya. I'm not graduating anyway. Why do you even care? Go back to class, Toya. Hey Josh, man, I'm about to order me some food from (mumble)! You want some? - Yeah I do man, I'm broke though. - [Dennis] Nigga, I ain't ask you all that. I got you. - In that case, let me get a 10 piece catfish nugget with a large fry and a strawberry pop. A large strawberry pop too. - [Dennis] Damn, boy. - You asked. How long they time that on our food? - Shit, they say give 'em about 20, 30 minutes. - You straight, boy? - Yeah, I'm good, man. Shit just really fucked up right now, you know? - Ain't gotta tell me, man. Sitting here wondering if life's supposed to be this damn hard. (laughing) What, I tell a joke? - Man, you and Calvin a trip. Y'all niggas swear y'all life is hard as mine when it ain't. - D, you really don't know shit about my life. - Man Josh, you the Captain of the basketball team. You can have any girl in the school you want to, right? And on top of that, you got the choice of any D-1 school you want, right? That's a fucked up life? I must be in Hell right now. - Man, you sound just like everybody else. So what, you see me and you think "damn that "boy got the world," huh? Man, you have no idea what I go through. - Okay, I can see your brother getting killed has still been a little hard to deal with, right? You know Dave with my guy too. But you still go both your parents. - So what? - What you mean so what? I never knew my father. I say you got it pretty goddamn good where I'm sitting. - Yeah, and that's the thing. You sitting on the outside. So you ain't got no idea what's going on on the inside, man! - What? - Look, I'm just saying. Sometimes not having a father is better than having one at all, man. - Here, man. - D, I don't smoke! - You need to 'cause you sound stupid! - Man, look. I want you to think about something. - What up? - You ain't got nobody to lie to you, man. Sell you dreams, pretend like they love you when it's convenient for them. Especially around tax season. Tell you they gonna come to all your games and don't never show up for not one of 'em. Man, I got everybody telling me Josh, you could be the greatest. Josh, man, you could be the best! Only problem is this coming from everybody but the person that I need to hear them words from the most. A man I wake up in the house with every day. A man I look up to the most, man. Why he don't love me? I'm a good dude. - Hey bro, I don't even know. (dramatic music) You don't cry, motherfucker, all right? Gonna go check on this food, man. (coughs) (rap music) - (mumble). I wonder where everybody at. - I know you not gonna keep waving and smiling at him after what happened the other day. - Oh, you thought I was waving at Josh? Girl please, ain't nobody thinking about no Josh. Nobody even thinking about him. He does look good playing ball though, don't he? - Yeah, he looks just as good as when he kicked you out the other day. - Ha ha, whatever. I bet you he won't do that to me again. I know you ain't talking, what about you and your boo? - Boo, who's my boo? - Girl, don't even play. Everybody peeped it, you already know. - Who, Dennis? - Yeah, Dennis! - I don't even know him like that. - Whatever, I know you wanna get to know him like that! Hey! - Yeah, so I can get kicked out too? Yeah! - You gonna stop trying to be funny. (laughing) - I'm just playing, I'm sorry. - I don't think it's funny. - I'm sorry. I was just kidding. I do need a Prom date though. - Oh no, I know you not thinking about taking Dennis aka D-Money to Prom. Girl please, I'd love to see you get him in a Prom suit. (laughs) Better yet, I wanna be there when he gets there so I can see the look on Auntie Lisa's face. (gasp) Toya, Toya, lock up all this China! What's going on?! (laughs) It's a raid! - Whatever, shut up, you know he's not even that bad. - Yes he is. - No he's not, he's really smart, he writes poetry, he plays basketball. All he needs is a little bit of help. - [Angie] He's a thug, that's what he is. - [Toya] Whatever. - You really like him, don't you? Oh well. Guess I don't see nothing wrong with y'all going on Prom together. - Thank you. - As long as you got some bail money for D-Money. - Bail money? - Girl, bail money. Prom is three months away, he's always in trouble. You already know he'll be in jail by then. - Josh getting better, ain't he? - Yeah man, he is. He wasn't like that Freshman year though. - That's 'cause he's been practicing. He's focused. - Yeah, I guess. Dude got game though. - All that practice,that boy going to the league, I'm telling you. - You think so? - Yeah, for sure. - Nah man, he not good enough. - Yes he is. He is, trust me. - Nah man, I don't see it. Niggas around here don't go to the league like that, man. - Why you always gotta be so negative, man? - I ain't negative, man, I'm just I'm really just speaking the truth, that's what I do man, I speak the truth. - Nah man, the truth is is he going to the league. - All right, if you say so. - Hey man, why your mama so crazy? - Man, stop talking about my mama, man! - You getting so sensitive, man, straight up. - She is a little crazy though, ain't she? - Yeah. That's where you get it from, huh? - Hey man, that's my mama though, what can you do? You feel me? - I guess. Hey, you know Keisha pregnant. - You lying, man. Is it yours? - Come on, man, I hope so. - Nah man, you gotta go get her tested, man. - Keisha is not like that. - All right, man, you gonna find out in Maury, man. Gonna find out one way or the other, man. - Whatever. - I'm telling you. - Nah, man, straight up. - (mumble). So what y'all gonna do? - We gonna keep it. - You ready for that, man? - Got no choice, man. - Hey man, you need anything, holler at me, all right? - For sure, man, appreciate that. - But I'm so glad I'm not you. - Yeah all right, for now. One day. - Shit man, please. I'm all about this money, man, green faces. - What up, boy? - How's it going? - What's going on? - Chillin', man. - What's going on, man? - [Calvin] I see all that practice is paying off. - Man, it's hot out here, what's up with you and your practice tough? - [Calvin] Come on, man, you know I'm training every day. - [Josh] That's what's up. Y'all ready to get up out of here? - Yeah, man. - [Josh] Waiting on you. Thirsty, man! - [Calvin] Man, let's do this. - Better pay attention to that ball, man. - Hey. - What up, Toya? - Nothing. You okay? - Yeah, I'm all right. Hey, sorry about the other day, you understand? I just thought you being condescending, so... - Condescending? - Yeah. Calvin said it earlier. I guess it just stuck with me is all, what you doing out here? (laughs) - Dennis, can I take you out? - Take me out? - A simple question. Can I take you out? - But you the girl and I'm the guy. I don't get it. - Yeah, but can't a girl just want what she wants and go after it? - Yeah, but it's backwards, don't you think? - Somewhat. But you still didn't answer the question. - I don't know, Toya, you look good, you feel me, but... I don't think you wanna mess with a guy like me. - I think I'm capable of making that decision for myself. - Okay. Don't say I didn't warn you though. - Here's my number. Oh, and I really don't think you're all that bad. And I'm not being condescending. Angie! (rap music) - Where are you taking me? - Just come here and I'll show you. - All right, this first lady I'm about to bring up is one of my favorite poets, people, women in the world. Such a wonderful chocolate woman. Clap (mumble) chocolate, man. (clapping) She is chocolate, she is wonderful. Ladies and gentlemen, Kayla. (cheering) - Generational curses. Generational curses leaving the next generation in hearses. Mothers carry more caskets than purses. And streets repeat crime scenes like the block is rehersing. And (mumble) by kids. Like it's the final act, you better send them packing in their backpack under the self defense act, it's like that. You better keep a glock in they lockers. Nurses in the nursery. Bulletproof vest in each desk and you better take them to the shooting range to take tests. 'Cause if they can't blast, they probably won't make it home from class. And it's sad. Some got the nerve to ask why I never gave life, why I'd rather keep my legs closed tight, let them put my eggs on ice than to lay up with labor pains and have my baby's life snatched in vain before it ever starts. And though I've never been called mother, somehow I still suffer the stretchmarks and you've probably never heard this, but even though I've never given birth to anything other than spoken verses, I ache for these babies like my cervix spread (mumble) the surface. I love with a passion, like I suffer contractions that hide them, and every time one dies, my uterus cries, my ovaries become overwhelmed, it's hard for my heart to bear and it's like a miscarriage and my womb weeps more than a broom sweeps and I lose sleep over the thought of five year olds who lose they life before they getting to lose teeth. I'm starting to hate to look at pencils and loose leaf. It only reminds me of the supplies that Darian Albus won't be using. And while these cowards were videotaping his innocent death for the Youtubing, he was taking more hit than a video could ever get, and I guess, I guess it made good for a good piece of evidence, but I can't stop myself from thinking maybe instead of watching this somebody could've been helping him and I can't scrape the image off the back of my cranium, how are they gonna laugh (mumble), I saw eyes with no remorse or shame in 'em, like wild hyenas no taming them and when it came to him, nobody came for him. The system dissed him. (cheering) - (mumble) is dope. - So this is your surprise, huh? - Yeah. What? You don't like it? - I mean yeah, it's cool. But how did you know I would like it? - Dennis, you walk around school with a smug look on your face and this tough exterior trying to fool everybody into believing that's who you are, but me and you know that's not true. - How can you be so sure? Maybe you're fooling yourself. - I'm not fooling myself. I know you're not like the garbage on the streets. I don't know if no one had the time to tell you how great you are, but you a special talent. You just need to recognize it, apply it, and believe you can do it. What made you get into poetry anyway? - I don't know. I just learned that there's more to life than this bullshit out here. - And we're back! (cheering) Yes, clap it up again! (mumble) Before we go into any else in the show, are there any other open micers here? - (clears throat) Right here. - [Host] All right, volunteering services over here. I think she really wants you to go. - Yeah, come on, Dennis, go ahead, it'll be fine, trust me. - [Host] It'll be good, man, come get something off your chest, man. Clap it up for this guy now, come on! (clapping) He looks absolutely excited, everybody, absolutely excited! First time, yo, show some love, first time. - This something that I just came up with. Last time I seen my pops, he said he was making a stop at the cornershop to get some pops. And I ain't seen him since. For all I know, he could be that three piece in the drop, or that (mumble) collecting bottle tops. When I was younger, every time I heard a knock I thought it was my father, but it wasn't. So the old hens on the block became my pops. My pops ain't sell rocks, but he was a rolling stone. I just wish his last stop would've been my fucking home. I wish my pops would've gave me the shot. Or at least shot off blanks, pop pop pop. Maybe I wouldn't be a son of a gun. And my mama calls me a son of a bitch. Because I look like you. Truth be told, if I saw you on the streets today, I wouldn't even know if it was you. I'll tie my first tie without the hands of my pops. Reoccurring thoughts of death bring tears to my eyes and I couldn't share with my pops. Now today every time I hear a knock I hope it's him. Not because I need him. It's my first time, guys, you know. - [Voiceover] Good talk, good talk! - Nowadays every time I hear a knock, I hope it's my pops, not because I need him. I wanna show him my resilience. The stones the builders rejected has now become the builder. I'm the son that you shun, but one thing about the sun, it's light is too bright for you to ever block it no matter how shady you are. And at the moment, I don't care where you are or who you are, I got this far without you. I got dreams that don't involve you. I'm misunderstood. I just wanna make good, but sometimes they don't turn out right. People judge me by my image. But we are all made out of the likeness of our fathers, right? That's all I got. (clapping) - Awww, look at that! Yes, that's wonderful! One more time (mumble) poetry. - [Dennis] For the first time in my life I felt free. Like I could finally just be me and it felt good. I saw the world different that night. - [Toya] No, stop, your mom's right there, quit it. - Hey, y'all. - [Dennis] What's up, Shay? - [Shay] Where's my food at? - I didn't know you was gonna be here. - [Shay] What? You ain't know I was gonna be here? - No, I didn't know you was gonna be here. - Where the fuck am I going, D?! I mean it ain't like I got a job or something. See you brought this bitch something to eat. - Shay, you trippin'. - [Shay] But you can't buy your mama nothing. You know what, fuck you and that bitch! - Hold on one second. Shay, why you trippin'?! If it was that serious you could've had my food! - It is that serious! This bitch come in my house eating all up in my face and then she didn't even offer me none?! I should've thrown that bitch food on the floor. - What would that prove, you still gonna be hungry! - But I bet you that bitch would be hungry too though! - [Dennis] Man, you sound crazy. - And what you mean what would that prove? - [Dennis] Y'all both gonna be hungry! - I get it. This bitch making you soft, huh? Got you thinking you high and almighty like you better than somebody. Well you ain't shit, Dennis, just like yo daddy wasn't shit! You wanna know why your daddy left? Huh? After I had your sister Didi, he left us. While I was in the delivery room having your sister, he left us! (dramatic music) I fucking remember. He would hold me in his arms. And tell me he would never let me go. He would tell me how beautiful I was. And how he was so lucky to have me. (sobs) I kept the house clean. I cooked every day. I loved your dad. He just didn't love me back. And if you think I'm gonna let some bitch come in my house and take you from me too, you gotta be fucking kidding me! Get that bitch out of my house, Dennis! Now! - Stop, Calvin. Stop it, Calvin. Stop, you're supposed to be studying, you're over here messing with me. - I'm tired of studying. It's time that we take a break. - Calvin, Keisha! - Come on. What's up, granny girl? - Hey baby. Hey, Keisha, this letter came for you today, Calvin, and I think we should open it together. Well are you gonna stand there, Calvin, or are you gonna open up the letter? - Open up the letter, Calvin. (mumble)? - Calvin, don't be discouraged. We just gotta apply to other schools and apply for more grants and you'll be fine. - Nah, man, no we're not. - What do you mean we're not?! - Calvin, what did we talk about? - Calvin, you have to go to school, I've worked too hard for you not to go to school. - Look at me, what did we talk about? - They want me! - [Voiceover] What?! - And they offered me a full scholarship. - Calvin, no! What school are you going to?! - He's going to TSU with me. - [Voiceover] Oh my goodness, Calvin! That's wonderful! Now you and Keisha will be able to start your family the right way. - Family? - [Voiceover] Boy, you know your grandmama know everything. - I haven't (mumble)-- - He's got a big mouth. - [Voiceover] It's okay, don't matter who told me. Listen, I just wish your mother and father was here to see you today. - Yeah. - But you know I remember when you were christened and the pastor was holding you in his arms and giving you back to the Lord. Boy, I said that day that I would never stop loving you and giving you all the encouragement that I could. Look at the man standing here today. You know what they say, when you raise up a child in the way he should go, when he get old he will never depart from it. Calvin, I'm so proud of you, baby. I'm so proud of both of you. - Thank you. - Hey ma. - Hey baby. - Why you smiling so hard? - Oh nothing, I was just looking through the mail today and ran across this letter from Duke University. - Duke University?! It actually came! - Well open it up, let's see what you got. Come on, open it up! - Ma, I got it, ma, I got it, yolo. - Well? What? - It says I didn't get in, mom. - What?! Josh please, stop playing. Come on, what it say? - No, mom. It says I got in, but they not giving me a full scholarship! - That's a good thing! Listen, don't worry about the money right now, baby. Listen, the important part is you've been accepted! And that's all that matters, Josh. Right? Come on, cheer up. You in there, baby. - You don't get it, mom! - What? - This was my one chance to do something great, prove everybody wrong. Now I'm just stuck! - Stuck? So when you say "everybody," you mean your father? - What you wanna prove to me? Hmm? That you can go off to some big ass college? Now what that mean to me? (heart monitor beeping) I know. Hey everybody, Josh is going to college. Hmm? Now what the hell does that have to do with me and my life?! - I guess nothing at all. - Mr. basketball big shot superstar, hmm? What we got, pimpin' ass Josh. Got all the ladies. Don't have no kids, don't have no bills, not a worry in the world. Now Duke University. That's it, you the man, huh, Josh? - No, pop, I'm not the man-- - You goddamn right you not the man! I work ten hours a day Monday through Friday! For 24 years now to keep a roof over our head and food on our plates, I'm the motherfucking man! - Senior-- - Where's my round of applause, huh?! Where's my job well done, huh?! Nah, I don't get that! All I get is a swift kick in the ass and the bill for your college tuition! That's my life! - That was the choice that you made! I didn't ask to be here! That was your choice! - What did you say?! Goddammit, don't you ever turn your back on me! - No, baby! - Well you just don't get it! You really don't get it. - Hello? - Hey, what's up? - Nothing up with me, what's up with you? - What do you mean? - I mean I've been calling you for the past week, now you just not answer my phone call. What's up? You don't mess with me no more? - No, it's not like that, Dennis. - Then what is it? Don't tell me my mom's got you trippin'. - I'm not the one who's trippin'. - Okay, so what are you saying? - Dennis, you have a lot of potential. And I believe you can do whatever you put your mind to, but it doesn't matter if I believe it. You have to. I just don't think that this relationship is gonna work. - What?! See, I knew this was a bad idea in the beginning. But you didn't wanna listen talking about you capable of making your own decisions. Now you don't htink it's gonna work out. I knew I shouldn't have got serious with any of you bitches anyway. - Bitch?! See that's what I'm talking about. Growing up, my father taught me never to let a man or anyone for that matter disrespect me. And that day I was at your house, I will never forget how your mother treated me! - That's my mom though. You act like it was me saying that stuff! - But by your just sitting there and letting her say that, it's just like you doing it. - What you mean let her? What was I supposed to say? - Whatever you felt was right at the time. I mean Dennis, you know when I come over to the house I always show your mother respect. I mean tell me this, would you let somebody talk to her like that? - You don't even know what you talking about right now. Know what? It don't even matter no more. Do what you want. - Yo man, watch the fuck you going, man! - Fuck you! - Yo man, hold on hold on hold on, we got a problem here, nigga?! - Get your fucking hands off me, man! - You remember me, motherfucker? - I don't even know you! - This motherfucker, yeah you do, nigga. Yeah you do, nigga, take a good look. You that same bitch ass nigga that rob my moms at the bank the other night! I know you remember that shit 'cause I don't forget nothing, cuz! - Man, I don't even know what you talking about right now. - Oh he don't know what I'm talking about, right? He think it's all good, so you calling me a liar, motherfucker?! If I say you that nigga that did it, you are that nigga that did it! - Aw yeah, whoop this nigga ass, man. - Fuck off me, you ain't that same bitch ass nigga that let me do it! Fuck off me, man! - (laughs) Hold on, nigga (mumble). Kill back, dawg, kill back. Yo man, this (mumble) got heart, dog. This little nigga got heart, hold on, let me give a hand for this motherfucker right here. This little nigga got heart! This little nigga done stepped up, grabbed a nut and got some motherfucking heart, dog! I can't even be mad at this nigga right now, dog! I can't be mad, kid. For real, dawg. Man, that don't mean shit to me, motherfucker! Now what?! - [Gang Member] Oh shit! - Nigga's gonna (mumble) weak at the knees right now. Hold on hold on hold on. I smell bitch on you, nigga! (laughs) This motherfucker ain't got nothing on me, dawg. - Hey man, y'all ain't even gotta do this, man. - Man fuck that shit, you should've remember that shit where you did what you did! - [Gang Member] Shoot this nigga, man, come on-- - I'm playing with him, motherfucker, I want this little nigga die slow right here, dawg. For real, kid. All that nigga bullshit, man. - Man, get this shit out my face, hey, good that you came when you did, Officer. They was talking about killing a nigga! - (mumbles). - (mumble)! - Hey, I thought you was suspended, Dennis. - Hey, my mama already talked to Ms. Johnson, I'm good. - Oh, okay. Take that hat off in my building. - What's up, granny girl? - [Voiceover] Hey, baby. - I'm about to head over to the gym. - Calvin, did you forget it's Tuesday? We have Youth Services tonight. - Come on, grandma, I go every Tuesday. It's not gonna hurt if I miss just one. Besides... Josh and his father got into it again. - Oh. - I guess he just wants me and Dennis to come over there so that he can vent. - Dennis? What is this talk about Dennis?! Now didn't I tell you I didn't want you hanging with him anymore! Baby, I know you think he's your friend, but anytime a person doesn't care about hisself or anything else, what makes you think he cares so much about you? - Man, that tape is a waste of time, bro. 'Cause when it come down to it, nobody cares. - I know you only have my best interest at heart. But you can't choose your friends, you know? Weren't you the one whole told me that you have to love your friends and family no matter how they are or what they may be going through? - Yes baby, I did. - Okay. - And you can't choose your friends, but you can choose what kind of friend you are to them. And I did teach you to love your family and friends in spite of their flaws. But there's nothing wrong with loving from a distance. Now you've tried to help Dennis time and time again. But sometimes in life baby, you have to let go and just let God. - Hey, you holler at Calvin? - No, he probably with Keisha. Old (mumble) nigga! Hey, hey they probably at home right now planning their wedding as we speak! - See that's where you wrong. He probably planning the wedding. - Hey man, fuck this practice shit, man. Let's get out of here. - All right, let me grab my stuff. - All right. - I hear you, grandma. You're right as always. I'm gonna go. - Calvin, wait a minute! - Come on grandma, if we don't leave now, we're not gonna make the Youth Service. - That's my boy. That's my baby, well you better go get dressed! - Man, what's up with him? Why is he so angry all the time? (phone buzzing) - Calvin, don't worry, it's gonna be fine. You right where you supposed to be. - Okay, granny girl. - Look man, you ain't never gonna understand somebody's life based on what you see on the outside. - What do you mean? - Don't worry about it. - Why you leaving, ain't you supposed to meet that scout in an hour? - Yeah I was, but I changed my mind. - What do you mean you changed your mind? - Look man, this basketball thing just ain't for me no more. - I've worked here for over 15 years and you one of the best ball players to come up-- - Man, I ain't shit! Just drop it, all right? - At least wait to see what the scout has to say! Josh! Josh! - [Josh] (mumble). Ready to get out of here? - Yeah man, let's get out of here. - What's wrong with you? Acting all funny and shit. - I was talking to Toya on the phone, she trippin', man. - Josh! - So what's good, man? I heard you and Calvin skipping town on a nigga. Going off to college and shit. - Yeah, Calvin probably is, I ain't going nowhere. - That's what's up, man, you better stay around here, man. You stick around long enough, you'll get like me. Shit, trust money, man, fuck school. - Come on D, I ain't trying to get wrapped up in a gang, man. Dude, I'm stuck here 'cause my mama (mumble) way too much money for me to get financial aid, and I'm not gonna do it. - Make no sense. - D, I don't get it, man. When we go downtown all the time we see all these white kids riding they Benzes. Driving nice cars, buying nice clothes. Why we can't have that life? - A generational wealth, bro. - What the hell is you talking about, man? - Generational wealth is where somebody comes financially stable and they build on top of their wealth. All right? They may buy into stocks and bonds, maybe invest in different properties, small businesses and before it's time for them to meet their maker, they write up a Will. With certain stipulations and conditions, you know what I mean? Making sure grandmas, cousins, different family members don't fuck it up. - Damn. - I know. That rarely happens in a black community. Because we so used to not having nothing, once we get a little credit or some type of money, we fuck it over faster than we can get it. - (mumble). - So like Calvin, we gotta wait 'till somebody die to have some type of shot at life. Shit's fucked up. - D, I don't get you, man. - What don't you get? - How somebody as smart and intelligent as your ass do the dumb shit you do! - (mumble) got this bitch ass nigga, there you go, right there. - It's all good, we gonna get him, we gonna roll up on that nigga, man. We gotta get that motherfucker hard, dawg. - You think I like robbing niggas and selling drugs, man? I got a grown ass woman and a baby to take care of. You can't choose your life before you get here, man, all you can do is live it. - I don't know about that. - Break yourself, nigga, break yourself! - Better stop playing! - Why y'all trippin', man? What's wrong, I know Big D ain't scared. - I'm gonna get that motherfucker. - Man, you don't even know what's going on right now. (heart monitor beeps) - What is going on? You play too damn much, man. - Checkmate, motherfucker! You can run, but you sure the fuck can't hide, nigga! What, come on, get this nigga, man! - Got yo bitch ass now, nigga! - [Voiceover] (mumble) checkmate, motherfucker! - Excuse me, hello. How you doing? Andrew Bants, Duke University? I'm looking for Joshua Coleman, is he around? - You must be that scout, he just left, let me go get him for you. - Oh no no, that's all right, that's all right, that's all right. You can just let him know there's been a little mixup, we would like to offer him the full academic scholarship, assuming he keeps his grades up. That's my number, you think you can have him give me a call? - Will do. Will do! - Thanks, take care. (laughing) (gunshots) - [Reporter] Three young men shot last night on the South side of Chicago. This is the 15th shooting this month on a high school student in the city of Chicago. Standing beside me is the mother of one of the victims. Ms. Anderson, is there anything you'd like to share with our viewers on behalf of your son? - (sobs) I just don't understand how something like this can happen to my son? I kept him away from people like that! I kept him in Bible Study every Wednesday and church every Sunday! He was a good kid! He was a Honor Roll student and a valedictorian of his graduating class and y'all took that from me! I done had him pay for my bills! I had him, y'all didn't think about me! Get this damn camera off my face! - When will our youth violence stop in the city of Chicago? How many more of our children will have to suffer before something is done? Ryan B. Mcnulty reporting. Finally. I would not have put The Olympics in this fucking zoo either. First you have the incident last year at Figer High School, now this shit? Fucking goddamn animals! Put all their fucking asses back in chains! Or something. Hey hey hey hey! Yo, we're still not taping, are we? Okay. Good. Now where's my damn coffee, Osiris? (dramatic music) - Goddammit! Who left the cap off the goddamn toothpaste?! Debra! Debra! (dramatic music) (gunshot) - I'm tired of all our young children dying! We got babies killing babies! When a child is killed in the streets people ask where were the police. And if a child gets killed in school, they ask well where were the teachers at. And everybody's quick to jump on the black President bangwagon, come on somebody! - Come on now, yeah, talk about it! - It is up to the parents, the aunties, the uncles! The guardians, the grandmamas and the granddaddies to take back our babies! Come on, (mumble)! It takes a village to raise a child! Not just one or two people! (clapping) The bible says in Proverbs 22:6 train up a child in the way he should go and when he gets old he will not depart from you, come on! From the delivery room to the college graduation, it is your responsibiltiy, my responsibility, it is all of our responsibility to make sure that these babies have a fair shot at life! Even if you didn't. Now come on, Holy Ghost. Now y'all know I like to preach. And I could be up here for hours, come on, someone. - [Voiceover] That's right, that's right. - But we have some more important business to handle. As you all know, Calvin, one of our brothers in Christ, was killed before he even had a chance to graduate from high school. But today... Mother Jackson and his girlfriend sister Keisha have decided to have their baby christened today. So at this time, I'd like to ask if mother Jackson and sister Keisha can come up at this time... With the baby. Come over, sister Keisha. Now before we begin, do you have any words you'd like to say on behalf of Calvin? - I really... Don't have much to say except that he's gone and I'll never see him again. I mean we've all sat down and tried to deal with death and how to take it. (sobs) I don't understand how can you prepare to say to somebody that you love. Calvin was the kind of guy that loved to help. And you couldn't help but love him. I truly believe that God sent Calvin to me. I mean it's like when me and Calvin was together, it was like nothing else existed. All I can say is he will truly be missed. - Come here, sister Keisha, come here. (sobbing) Sister Keisha... I know it's hard. But he's in a much better place now. He's with Jesus. Now you were talking about he was sent by God. That means you got some wonderful memories. Now what you need to do? Hold those memories inside. If you keep those memories deep in you... Look at that baby. You'll always have him. Okay? - Yeah, you're right. - You know, speaking of which, if we could get back to this christening, did y'all have a chance to maybe have decided who was gonna be the Godparents for this child? - We did, but they unfortunately couldn't make it today. - I wouldn't have missed my Godson's christening for the world. (dramatic music) (baby crying) - Are you the Godparent for that child? - Yeah. - Then I got a question for you. If that child decides to follow in your footsteps, are you gonna lead that child down the right path? - Hey man, you need anything, holler at me, all right? - For sure, man, appreciate that. - All right, man. - All right. - Okay.
