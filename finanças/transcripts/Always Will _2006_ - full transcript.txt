* When you're a kid, your friends are your world . Danny was the first friend I ever had. He wasn't very athletic. But that's kind of what brought us together. You need longer shoelaces. Yeah, I know. I met Jacob on our trip to The Colonial Village. Everyone thought Jake was weird 'cause he questioned everything. But he wasn't weird. He was smart. And funny. Once I introduced Danny to Jacob, I had my own little group. And it felt great. But even with these guys... some things still seemed out of reach. And when they weren't around... Don't. be. a. wuss! Help! ...some situations still made me feel powerless. We played 'Don't Touch The Ground' because it made us feel like soldiers. Heroes . It made us feel like someone other than ourselves. Jacob mapped out the best moves. I was pretty good at executing them. And Danny... always messed it up . At ten years old, you can't imagine life being any different . But let's face it, things happen...and there's nothing we can do about it. When we were in fifth grade our class took part in a time capsule ceremony . The idea was to bury items so a future generation could dig them up and learn about our lives . This was the last day of fifth grade. Next year, middle school. Unknown territory. Maybe that's why we did what we did. They say it's hard to let go of the past. Well, We were taking it with us. A lot happened by the time we got to high school . Eating paste, was no longer one of our habits . French became very popular . and summer jobs, very rewarding. Danny found himself some new friends . See, at the end of eighth grade... Danny and I had a falling out . Jacob, was the complete opposite . He didn't talk to anyone. And no one knew why. As for me, I was somewhere in the middle . For the most part, I just kind of kept to myself . but my eyes didn't. Keep movin' wuss. Our first day here... Some Senior told us how high school would be the best years of our lives so we better make the most of it. Well I know of one person who was listening that day... Josh Wheeler. Hey. Got a pencil I can borrow? Thanks. But I needed a #2. [laughs] Wheeler needed a pencil. I needed a lot more. How's that? Looks good. What happened? Nothin'. I fell in gym class. And that test... I got a C+. Tough day huh? Yeah. You should take up a sport. Or an instrument. Something. Sounds corny, but that stuff's good for your soul. Makes bad days seem not so bad. Least dancing did for me. But you don't dance anymore. Who am I gonna dance with? Your stepfather? Anyhow, this keeps me busy. I gotta tell you sweetie, I really enjoy it. It forces you to have faith in your decisions. Four years of college and I never knew this was for me until recently. You'll find your way. Follow your gut. And if you can't find your gut... just follow me. Hey Will. Come on Mom. Ok. You just lost your dance with one of the Rockettes. Guess I'll just go home. Look, it's to scale! I know, I know, I'm late for dinner. Well. Reason I'm late? These little babies. Tickets to next week's playoff game. Thing is, uh, I could only score two. That's ok. You guys go. No Mom. You and Al should go... Yeah Lyd. I got 'em for you and me. No hard feelings kid but you know, like a date... for your Mom and me. I get it. By the way, why didn't you cut the lawn? I was going to... but... Your mom does everything 'round here. You had one job... cutting the lawn. Still want that driver's license in the spring right? Al, he had a rough day. Thought you said the fall. Spring. Older you get, insurance rates go down. Makes sense right? Hey, hey watch it, I just so, each homeroom then chooses representatives to be considered for King and Queen in the spring. Ok Seniors, time to let your fellow classmates know how you feel about them. Julie Foster. Thanks. You're welcome. You're home early. What are you doing? Thought Al had off today? He did. He went over to Bob's house to watch the game. He works hard sweetie. Weren't we fine... without Al? You were four years old when your Daddy got sick. I wouldn't exactly call me runnin' between the hospital and day-care doing fine. Anyhow, Al was asking me about what colleges you were looking at and even mentioned you getting your license soon. He does care. Yea.. About getting me out of here. Will. I have something to show you. Look what I found! [laughs] Can you believe I never hung this up? Yes. You were so cute. Was. That's a great picture. And then, your Daddy and I used to dance to this record all the time. And then there was the time I caught you and Danny using it as a Frisbee. Sorry. How is he? Danny? How would I know? You see him around school right? Does he have friends? I guess. He's kinda like me. Friends with everyone. Why don't you call him? Before you both go off to college next year. You know this whole thing It's just silly. life's really too short to let trivial events ruin a good friend ship. You guys was so close Dude, Danny, you're not supposed to put your own laces in those shoes. This are my lucky laces I'm askin' her. Kelly? . Seriously? Seriously. Feels like the right beat. Why's that? She thread my needle twice in sewing class. Since when was taking sewing the right beat? Look, Will, eighth grade's over. We're men now. And I've come on to every other girl in the school. You should ask Julie. Look, she's all by herself. No way. I don't know why the rest of the school doesn't see it. She's nice. She's smart. She's funny. She's so cute. She's coming over here! Just ACT COOL. No, Danny, Kelly's coming over here! Dance with me! It's a slow song! Umm...wanna dance? ...Will? Can't leave 'til ten. Hello? Oh. Hey Al. I said why don't you go down to the basement and clean it out so I can start renovating down there? This was with the mail. These are the supplies I need to start on the roof. How do you have the patience for that stuff? What's the point? You know what Mom? Maybe I will...call Danny. Danny? You don't need that kid. Call him sweetie. And then mow the lawn! Danny. Danny. Umm...wanna dance...Will? I...uh, have to go to the little boy's room. the men's room. Come on. Whoa. Come on Will! It opens TONIGHT! -What's up Will? No thanks... I mean, not much... Not here. -What is it? How come whenever that guy's around, I feel like dry heaving? Like me with my BMX jump? What's up Will? Lisent to me, Party at Chuck's after Saturday game, and bring whoever. Not eatin'? Not very hungry. Coach would flip if he saw this. I had my three Power Bars today. Hold than a second. Hey man. We cool? Wh..Why is that? Wait. Coach? You're really gonna prove yourself Saturday. Danny, tell me I'm on the chess team. Yeah, try tellin' all your football pals you play chess. Can I get you guys anything? You got any Power Bars? How can I be playing high school football? Nerf scares me! What are you talkin' about Will? You knew you might have to play. But how could I even make the team? "Oh, Wheel's and I are so cool, he got me a place on the bench"! What are you...what was I talking about? Do you know how many girls want to see you play Saturday? I'm gonna go from being the "best friend of the guy who sits on the bench" to being the "best friend of the guy who actually plays"! I mean it's big for me too. Look, Danny, there's something I gotta show you man. Sorry man. You should probably go. Can you tell me? I'd rather show you. Tomorrow. Tomorrow man. You want to design something, design the basement! Go back to school? You're forty for God's sake. We got a mortgage! Will, would you please excuse us for a couple minutes? Yeah . No hard feelings but go away. Do NOT talk to him that way! It's a stupid idea Lydia. You going back to school. It's selfish is what it is. Mom. You can't keep... So you were with us down the shore? Me, Mom, Al and you? Yes. And you're saying you don't believe me? That, until yesterday, we haven't spoken since eighth grade? That we didn't egg old man Naylor's house? I guess what I'm saying is... I don't have those memories. Dude. We egged Naylors? You did. Mine broke in my hand. All right,look. The capsule. That one you, me, and Freak Boy took? -Shhh. Yes. I don't know how but it lets me...travel back in time. You know, this is why schools have counselors buddy. Seriously. It lets me, like, revisit a moment in the past. Let's see: "Friends don't let friends drive drunk". "Just say no". Damn, what are the instructions for this situation... -Seriously. Come on. I had to tell someone. Look, Will. What am I supposed to say? You're telling me that you don't remember being on the football team, being cool with Wheeler, or even being friends with me! And now this? You didn't believe my spin-the- bottle story. That story wasn't even true. You still didn't believe me. Watch. Hey man, what time's that party? Do you think I'm crazy for wanting to go back to school? No. Not at all. It's what you want to do. It's what you should be doing. Al should understand that. Yeah, he will. I think change just scares him. He worked at your elementary school for so long before he finallypushed himself to go into construction. Then he of all people should understand what you're trying to do. You know, we never saw him bust his hump around our school. Everyone just saw him as that mean Custodian. Kids'll think any grown-up in boots and dirty overalls is mean. Billy Winston still swears to me, to this day, that Al chugged every drop of grape juice right out of his Superman thermos. Every day. You think Al even cares about me? Of course sweetie. He's practically watched you grow up. So has old man Naylor. Why'd didn't you just go and marry him? Oh yeah? Least he gave out Halloween candy. Sometimes I think Al just sees me as part of the deal. I wish I remembered Dad. The only memory I have of him is sitting on the swing out on the porch. Your dad really loved that swing. He said it gave him answers. Why'd you put it down the basement? cause all it gave me were memories...and Al...he didn't... This one will work. What do you think? I think you should take it down and put it with your records. Let me guess. You need to borrow some cash 'cause you forgot it's tator-tot Thursday again. What? I'm fine. I'm glad Will. Don't you remember the beating I took yesterday? I mean, my eye! Ummm...No. Dude, you were right there. Remember I hit that big guy? Oh,Oh right. I get it. This is you trying to prove you can use that thing from fifth grade to change things. How's this? If you really do have the ability to change the world around you, I mean if I had that ability, I'd be a BMX superstar. And have a girl like her cheering me on. Hey, nurse? Isn't it true that lice love clean, beautiful hair? That's what they say. "Julie's the cleanest girl in our class", "I bet I have lice", "Me too", Dude, I'm so gonna fail that Shakespeare test. I can't understand a word the man says. Hey ladies. -Hey. Hey Will. He's so cool. It's just his attitude about life, you know? He just rolls with it. I like your style Will. You know, whatever happens next after this place... I hope it feels somethin' like this. Like what? I don't know. Like, safe. Can I tell you something? When I was in elementary school my Mom,she used to make me wear a plastic bag in my pants 'cause I'd wet myself! Hey Will. Go Will!" Will is the man! Hey man. Yo. What's up? You tell me. You don't call me back! You don't tell me about the party! You talk about me behind my back! And you don't come to my BMX tryout! What? When was it? I can still go! How'd you do? Fine. I did fine. So you made the team? Look, that doesn't matter Will. You've really changed man. I mean, first, you go acting all innocent and pretend like you don't know anything. And now, you're more popular than ever. What's up man. I can't help people liking me! Oh no? Look, Danny... -No! Take me to it. I wanna change some things myself! All right. So what you do, is you put your hands on the capsule and you think back to a moment in your life. Like, a memory. Like...Like that time I told that girl I had front row tickets to the "In Sync" concert. You lied about that? -Yeah. My tickets were in the nosebleeds. I'm not sure if changing something like that would really... Okay then. My bike jump. Okay. With skills, you have to go back to when you were young and make yourself practice the skill. You know? Got it. Think back to the memory. This is crazy! And you're a liar! Dude! This is crazy! And you're a liar! This is crazy! And you're a liar! Things are really screwed up, Will! Sup' superstar? Where's it at man? Where's what? You know every one of our moves. Playbook, Where's it at? I don't know what you're talkin' about. Step aside. You did fine, Charles. But the highest grade gets the English Award. Is it true Charles' old man flipped on him? Charles is going through a tough time right now. He'll be out for awhile. And that's for Simms! Psst. Psst. "Ill deeds are doubled with an evil word". "Tis slander whose edge is sharper than the sword". Your pal Will's been talkin' smack about you man. So I spoke to an advisor at the college downtown today. They said that with my undergraduate degree, I could apply in the spring and start classes in the fall. Four nights a week. Two years. Two years and I'm done! Oh, you'll definitely get in! You know, Al, once I get my driver'slicense, I could really help out around here. Let mom focus on her stuff. Here we go. Me. Me. Me. It's Probably why Danny left steamin' outta here the other night. Probably sick of that talk. By the way, Danny's father called earlier today. Said something about maybe doing some work in their basement in the spring. Some cement work. I'll call 'em tomorrow. Maybe I'll ask Danny myself why he's no longer pals with the kid the whole damn school seems to love. About the classes... Look Lydia, next fall's bad timing. Some college for this one is gonna be digging into our pockets big time. You know, I have savings for Will. You know that. Oh, yeah. I forgot. No hard feelings Lyd, but we don't need that money. We're okay without it. It's not gonna work. You not being here every night. Mom... You know, He's probably right. With loans and stuff. I've no business getting involved in a career so late. I could just keep it a hobby, like dancing...was. Mom, you're starting to sound like him. Guess I'm just a little confused. Well don't be. Follow your gut. And if you can't follow your gut... Being the person I am now has made Al different. He's threatened by me. I think he's jealous of me. But you've always been this way. As long as I've known you. What are you saying? Nothing. Don't you guys have anything in common? Yeah. Mom. No matter what I change, I still can't get the guy to like me. Screw that. I wish Danny and I were still cool. Hey Wheels! Hey man, what's up. I'm real sorry. How you feeling? -Better, thanks. Hi Julie. Hey. Hope you feel better. Thanks. I'm real sorry man. No problem man. Took it for the team, right? See you at practice bro. Kinda heavy on the apologizing, don't you think? I...just feel bad. Don't feel so bad. Looks like he's getting back to his old self. Betcha' a guy like that is a real softie on the inside. I gotta go. I'm late for work. What? I wish I remembered what that felt like the first time. Yearbook! I gotta go. Will, Will we're late for practice. Let's go! No man is an island! Every man on this field has a job to do! To stick to the man next to you! To stick to this pact! To never change it! To let it dictate your actions! ...This is a bond we'll always have. Always stick together! ...and Jacob, if you, like, ever get weird or something... Guys, I think I hear my Mom! How do I have the...? We need to talk. When we were in eighth grade, my brother broke his leg. He missed his entire last season of baseball. I don't remember an accident . That's because there never was one . That you'd remember... or anyone else for that matter . Because it's not the eighth grade you remember it as. It was the eighth grade I made for myself . Like you're doing now with high school. I know Will. I know because I did it too. And my brother got hurt 'cause of it. But he's okay now? -Yeah. Because I changed it. I needed to. Summer after fifth grade, I discovered the same thing you did . I was friends with everyone. Felt completely safe. Until one day... You remember that awful summer camp my parents used to send me to? Well, my secret weapon didn't work outside my house and suddenly...I was on my own. And being on my own scared me. Why doesn't the capsule work outside your house? I wanted an explanation too so I did a little research. 'Course you did. Turns out the capsule was given to our school by the family of James Cooley. Cooley was some theorist in the 1950's. He believed if you were in the right environment and had the right tool, memories could physically propel you back to certain moments in your life. They tell us all this at the ceremony? Just check out the bottom of the capsule. What I do know is what we brought home was a tim capsule. And our homes are places we've lived in our whole lives. Places that stayed the same, while we changed. Maybe we can only change the past from the one place that's seen us live it.. You know. Had I not just experienced twelve years of school in six weeks, I'd be laughing at how crazy you sound. It's no joke Will. Yeah. Danny's mad 'cause of it. Danny should be the least of your worries. That capsule let me plant the seeds I knew would start to grow through middle school. And they did. I had it all. No regrets. Until that day... Steven had his accident 'cause Mom had him out looking for me. And he had to rush to baseball practice. Didn't you just... Yeah, Yeah I did. I went back to earlier in the day when I said goodbye to him. Only this time, I stayed home. Two weeks later. He took a fastball in the face. Went blind in one eye. Whoa. But what's that have to do with everything else? Guy who threw it... ...had an issue with someone I was dating. Who? His girlfriend. Every time I tried to change something, something else went wrong. And the guilt I felt over what happened to my brother was too much so... I went back to the moment right before I discovered what the capsule could do... ...and walked it right out of my shed. Out of my life. Only I couldn't bring myself to get rid of it, 'cause of you, me, and Danny. 'Cause of our pact. You know, silly kid stuff. I just knew I needed to get it out of my hands. So you put it in mine? I buried the capsule in your basement never thinking you'd make the same discovery, Will. Yeah, too late. Thanks for burying your problems under my roof! That was just the beginning of my problems. By placing the capsule in your house on that day, it made it impossible for me to get back to the present. What? Think about it. That capsule's our ride. And I got rid of it mid-trip. By taking the capsule away from myself in fifth grade, it means I would no longer have It in eighth. Couldn't return from the trip staring down at the thing like always 'cause the capsule was no longer in my possession. But that would mean that... you were stuck in fifth grade. Man, I remember that walk. Knowing I'd have to re-live those three years no longer as a King but -- as a nobody. You have no idea what it's like to experience the same three years you've already been through. Knowing everything that's gonna happen and then watching as it does. Always being one step ahead of fate. So when we all started sixth grade for the first time... It was the second time for me. Which is why you shut us all out. I had to. I was afraid of what I knew. Wait. If you were re-living those three years, every change I made must have been obvious. And you still ignored me? I'm sorry Will. If I tried to talk to you about what you were doing, tried to stop you, it would have played some part for better or for worse, it still would have factored in. That's one thing I did learn from all this. And what if you resisted? Huh? Got upset! You don't anger someone who could take it out on your fate. Can't imagine what you went through. If you're not careful Will, you won't have to imagine it. And Danny? Sometimes, you just gotta let people make their own decisions. One more thing. How'd I do? Those years you spent altering your life? You were a nobody Will. Just Like you were before all this. But we were friends. Think about me, Will. And stop changing anything else. Tomorrow night, you and Julie stop here for pictures. I know Mom. I already told her. I gotta go. Ok, sweet heart. Prom tomorrow? I told you, one week before my admissions interview. Maybe I'll go back to school too. This way, we can all forget about our responsibilities. Yeah, maybe I'll be an Astronaut. Limo will be at your house by six. Already told me that babe. And we'll get our pictures done as soon as we get to the prom. Like the Winter Formal. And the Junior Prom. What's up guys! Hey Wheels. You goin' to Phil's party or the after-prom? After prom? What, with thirty parents and chaperones hanging out? Soon as that DJ calls last song I'm in my car, rolling down to the shore. What, no last dance? My last dance is on the beach under the stars. Sounds kind of romantic. Yes Will. -JFK. That's a good answer but I'm sorry, you're incorrect. Wow. -Will. One wrong answer around here and you're meat. I know you're no stranger to "Senioritis"... ...but your hard work has finally paid off. Your grades are such that we as a school... want togive you a scholarship to help you out your freshman year of college. Congratulations! -Thnak you. Mom? Why did he...? -When I saw you that day in fifth grade...that last day at the ceremony, I looked at you and I like knew that you were going to be in high school in a flash. Meeting Al at that moment, was like I was being handed the support I...I really needed. Wait. Fifth grade? I thought you met Al when I was in middle school. We started dating then. But we met that last day. At that ceremony. We didn't talk much but, yeah, he was there. The way he let you kids take turns sitting in that little crane. You all got such a kick out of it. I really thought I saw something in him that day. It was like we shared the same needs. I swear, he was so different then. He was kind...caring... But he's really changed. And I guess I have too. I mean there are things I want to do with my life. Things I really wished I had done. Your Daddy always encouraged me to go back to school for something creative. You should. Don't let Al stop you. I thought meeting him that day was fate... working in my favor. But now I just realize if it wasn't me, it would've been somebody else. Maybe that's the fate of it all. Had we not met that day, and he always reminds me of this, he probably just would have moved down south and worked with his brother. Wait. I didn't know he planned to move down south. He was supposed to fly out the next morning. That ceremony was actually supposed to be his last day at your school. He said he couldn't leave until he came back and saw me. Sometimes I just wonder who he would be with had he gone. Would he be happy? You would. Mom? Yeah? Al once told me I held you back. Never. I know Mom. Life's got a funny way about it, huh baby? And there's just not a thing we can do about it. One more day. Feels like I could stay here forever. Ever wonder how this happened? What do you mean? Us. Lying here. You ever wonder how in another time, another place, you'd be sharing this moment with someone else? Wanna know what I think? I think whatever's meant to happen, does. I mean fate throws you into the moment... you just gotta choose to go with it. Just know that I fell for you a long time ago. What's this doing in our house? Will, you guys stole from the school? So it all started with this. You were a bad kid then too, huh? He's not a bad kid, Al. I'm gonna turn this into the school right after work. Your actions do have consequences! Al. Wait. No, Lydia! He's gonna learn! This isn't how I raised him. You? Like I don't have a say in this! I raised him from the start! Exactly. To think, they actually reward crooks like you. After years of putting up with the guy, you're taking a stand now? Why? 'Cause things got a lot worse. So let him turn it in. What's the worst the school could do? I need it back Jacob. Why? -For one more.. You kidding? After everything we talked about you're actually thinking about... What is it? Jacob, I'm asking you to believe me. I need to make one more change. I need to. Come on, Be home. What makes you think he'll care? Holy... Al's got somethin' on him, Danny. He found the capsule... The capsule! Here we go again... Danny, will you just listen to me? I need the capsule for one more thing. I need it to help my Mom. Look, I'm not saying things will be better... but if school plays out the way it was supposed to... who knows, maybe we'd be okay. Come on man. What do you say? Will you help me? I'm here aren't I? When I should be hiding in a corner. Come on man. We gotta help him. You know, I think Nintendo's still on pause from the last time you were here dude. Where you been? Long story. Maybe you should go distract 'em. You know how much I hate talking to the guy. Remember that Fourth of July picnic... Actually no. Oh. Right. Keep an eye out for my guinea pig. He escaped a few days ago. -What's his name? "Hamster". -"Hamster"? "Hamster". You named your guinea pig "Hamster"? 'Course I named my guinea pig "Hamster". Why didn't you just call him "Guinea Pig". GUYS! Hey Al, need a drink or somethin'? Hey Danny, how you doing? Beautiful. Guys, you need to hurry! Whoa. That's floor reinforcement. You know how long it's gonna take to get your feet through all that? That's why we're not gonna risk going through it. Ahhh! My leg! Don't look at me. That actually happened. Way to go Hamster! So...now what? Now I'll go back to the day of the ceremony. I'll take the capsule from the teacher's lounge and...I'll get rid of it. ...just don't put it in my shed. Trust me. I'll really get rid of it. It'll never be buried. It'll never be dug up. The ceremony will be canceled and Al's flight won't. But what if you take the capsule, hold it for a day, and then put it back in the teacher's lounge? Al will still make his flight and the ceremony will happen... just a day later. I can't change the choice of digging it up. It's me going against two kids who won't want to lose their past. Even if I know not to doesn't mean you two won't. I can change a lot of things, but I can't change human nature. It's a chance I can't take. You know, the whole time I was doing this, I ignored the fact that what I was doing was wrong... until I saw you hurt... and I spoke to you. But what Al's doing to my Mom. How he's breaking her spirit. Makes doing this one more time, actually feel right. But if you take this away from us...won't that... But college in the fall, Julie... A memory I'll always have. It just happens to be the price for making Al one too. Look, I know Julie. I mean, I know who she is. And I know how we are together. And who knows, maybe when we get back to this day, and things are fresh... I'll get to know her the right way. Hey, my bike! Doesn't matter does it? I sucked anyway. See you in the next life guys. Gotta go do some homework. Where you goin' with that? Come on Wheeler, you have to let me go. Hey, isn't that what we're burying today? What are you doin' with it? Come on Wheeler. Please! No. Gimme. Keep movin' wuss! I know Julie. I mean, I know who she is. And I know how we are together. Maybe when we get back to this day, and things are fresh, I'll get to know her the right way. Hey guys. Hey man, d'you hear? I wasn't supposed to say anything but it's cool now. What? -Julie. She left. Her and Wheeler. Just picked up and rolled outta here. Soon as their names were called. Someone said they were talkin' about eloping or something crazy like that. King and Queen. Off to find their Kingdom. This was Wheeler's Kingdom. Just went to find a new one. Think they're scared? Who knows? Nothing any of us could have done. Sometimes you gotta let people make their own decisions. I guess you could say my high school experience was unlike any other . But that would be unfair. 'Cause everyone tastes the insecurity. The heartache. Somewhere along the way . I still speak to Danny and Jacob. But not that often . Do I think about high school? Sure. Do I think about Julie? About what we had? Yeah. Sometimes out of nowhere. Excuse me, Will? Hi! -Hi. I can't believe this. We went to high school together. You won't remember me. I had glasses...and my hair was a lot longer. I was a transfer student. It was rough. But you were always a really nice guy. When was I...that way to you? Always. You just always were, no matter what. Right. What did you say your name was again? Oh. Jennifer. Jennifer Cooley. Like I said, things happen . And when they do...you gotta let 'em. What may seem like a big deal at the time...may only just be wet cement. It's okay to let your feet touch the ground. People may not remember the things you do and say... but everyone remembers how you made them feel.
