ALICE IN EARNESTLAND Chapter 1 - Psychotherapy Hours of operation: Mon - Fri 10 a.m. - 5 p.m. Maseok Community Center Free counseling services You know, last month... Can you come back tomorrow? Pardon? You're too agitated. We can't have a session like this. Let your emotions settle down first. Come back when you feel better. We'll talk again then. Today's sessions are over. You should all come back tomorrow. We're closed for the day. Do not scream. I'm very good with my knife. I'm sorry but... did you get counseling from me? What's with the knife? Why are you doing this? What's this? What is it? I work in a restaurant. Ha! I see. No wonder it tastes so good. What you're doing is a serious offence. If you had a problem with the session, you could make a formal complaint. Alright. Things like this can happen with counseling. It's not like I don't understand. I assure you, I'll never speak of this to anyone. Can you at least tell me why you're doing this? It's a rather long story. Is that okay? Sure. When I was sixteen... which was the final year of my middle school, I was faced with a huge decision. Do I get a job in the local factory or do I go to high school and study three more years? It was a matter of paramount importance. Because it was a choice between a life as a factory worker and as an elite. After some serious deliberation, I chose the life of an elite. It was a reasonable choice. Typing, abacus calculation, and bookkeeping... I got certified in all disciplines in the field of bookkeeping. By 10th grade, I had 13 certificates under my belt. I've always been naturally dexterous. Anything you do with hands, I could mimic after one look. JEONG Su-nam, 10th grader Holder of most certificates Anything you do with hands, I could mimic after one look. JEONG Su-nam, 10th grader Holder of most certificates JEONG Su-nam, 10th grader Holder of most certificates When I got my 14th certificate my teacher told me, When I got my 14th certificate my teacher told me, 'Your real weapon that others can't have even if they tried... It's your body.' 'A woman who knows that can get anything she wants.' I had boobs as big as my aspirations. Back then, I had hopes for a bright future. You're all like that at that age. Only while out on placement did I realize that my certificates were completely useless. I once saw my landlord's son going to a computer class and asked him. What do you learn there? 'We just play video games, ' he said. And I thought my landlord had money to burn. Eventually, I got a job in a small factory where they didn't have computers. My teacher knew to advise about my boobs but had no idea that computers were taking over the world. And my boobs... They were nothing. You made a mistake with the calculation again. Don't you know how to use a calculator? Are you retarded? What did you do at school while everybody was learning? There, I had my first drink, tasted the bitterness of life, and experienced a man for the first time. Let's buy a house first. We need a house if we want to have kids. Let's think about baby later. I won't raise my kids the way I was raised. So, we must buy a house before having a baby. I'm so happy now. I want to be with just the two of us. Let's put off our honeymoon until after we buy a house. Okay? Can we do that? Did you listen to any of the things I said? There is nothing wrong with the hearing aid. Hearing aid is fine. Then what's the problem? You don't have to shout. But, I wasn't. It's not the hearing aid. You have lost your hearing ability completely. Tell him 'almost' not 'completely.' Almost... Have you heard about a procedure called 'cochlear implant?' When does a human being feel happiness? If you want to know, go into the forest and open your arms wide. Then you'll find yourself closing your eyes almost automatically in order to hear sound. The sound of the wind. The whisper of bustling leaves. The chirping of birds. The most sensitive of our senses is the sound. But you can't hear sound? That's why we have cochlear implants. Do you want to hear the sound of happiness? We guarantee you'll benefit 100% from this procedure. But we'd like to emphasize that we cannot guarantee that there will not be any side effects. Price - USD 20,000 It's too expensive! You're not gonna have the surgery? House first, surgery later when we have the money. It's too expensive! So, you'll shout like this until we buy a house? Am I shouting now? Surgery first. We can buy house later. But house is the priority. We can't raise our kids the way I was raised. That's why we need to buy a house first. Then, this marriage is off! Okay, fine! I'll have the surgery. I said I'll have the surgery! Can you hear me from here? Yes, I can. It's good that you had the surgery, right? It costed like hell. It's nice and uncomfortable. It's good to be living together, right? Give me a smile. Isn't he a good man? I told him since we weren't going on a honeymoon, let's go to a nearby beach. Su-nam, it's your husband. He had an accident! Between a prostitute and a gynecologist, who do you think knows better about venereal diseases? A prostitute? Or a gynecologist? It's prostitute. They notice even the smallest changes in their bodies and can tell what disease it is. Because it's their body. They're incredibly professional. Next time if this ever happens again, bring back the fingers in iced water. Some people wrap them up in a cloth or tissue paper. But it's best to simply drop them in a glass of water. It keeps them fresh that way. Okay? If you bring them back like that, I'll sew them back together like brand new. Okay? I swear to God... I had no idea I had them in my pocket the whole time. Put the damn knife away where I can't see it! It's PTSD. Pardon? Post-traumatic stress disorder. A kind of an anxiety disorder. That's why he is terrified of knives. He must've sustained a severe trauma from the accident. You shouldn't dismiss it lightly. It can trigger depression and make the social life difficult. The counseling offered here... We aren't sufficiently qualified to provide real help. He should see a real doctor. No. That won't be necessary. We should buy a house first. We can't raise our kids like I was raised. That's why we should buy a house first. There was a much simpler way A wedding is a promise. A house is a vow. to bring happiness back into his life. A wedding is a promise. A house is a vow. Buying a house. 270,000 divided by 50 equals 5,4,000... 270,000 divided by 60 equals 4,5,000... 45,000 divided by 365 equals 12.3.28... divided by 70 is 3,857 divided by 365 is 10.567... 80... 3,375... 365 days... 9 years and 2 months... At 80 dollars a day... 9 years and 2 months... I have no time. I can sleep later. I need more work. If only I work hard enough... This month, I made 967 dollars. Oh, the rent, bills, residence tax, and groceries... I forgot to count them in. At this rate, I gotta do this for 21 years. I need to work more hours. Just little more. If only I work harder... I can do this by myself. Apartment 1204, done. And finally, 9 years later... I was able to take out a mortgage. I worked hard and steadily but the house prices soared steadily, too. How did you buy this house? Loan: USD 140,000 I saw his tears and realized that he loved me, too. Thank goodness... He loves me still. He loves me as much as I love him. You okay? Can't you give me a little more time? I'm not quite finished. Someone will be here soon. Who? A man. A strong man. Oh, him... He's not coming. Why not? Did you take a bath? It smells like soap. What's this? Wait... Just a minute, baby. Baby, please... Hang in there. Baby... Why did you do it? Don't die on me, please... Help! Help us! Hang in there, baby. Please don't die... Help! Somebody! Baby, please... Please! Help! Chapter 2 - With my darling honey bee The hospital bill must be a big burden on you. I wanted to tell you about 'Death with Dignity.' Many people get it confused with euthanasia. But there is a big difference. Whereas euthanasia is deliberately terminating life by stopping treatment... A very inhumane practice... Death with Dignity refers to a physician-assisted suicide where we let the patient choose how and when he dies making the process peaceful and respectful of his dignity. It's a huge difference. You understand? The most significant difference is that Death with Dignity is legal while euthanasia isn't. I'm told you have a snowball of unpaid bill. I'm offering you advice in good faith informing you of your options. The patient is deaf and disabled in the hand. To put it simply, don't think about anything else. Just remember this. Dignity in other word is honor. Isn't it important that we live with honor as human beings? I pledge allegiance to the flag of the Republic of Korea to devote myself with full loyalty for everlasting glory of the nation and its people. Order, arms. Next is the national anthem. We're supposed to sing it but let's just skip that. Please take your seats. My name is KIM Su-cheol. I represent the borough office. Anyway... The reason I asked you to come today was for a good reason. After years of persistent and unrelenting endeavor, our borough has finally been designated 'Urban Renewal Area.' Isn't that what we've all been waiting for? The first phase of redevelopment will take place from here... to here. Like this. Are you kidding us? Please calm down and listen. This is how it's supposed to go. We can't dig up the entire city at the same time. We might as well building a new country from scratch. The renewal will start in this pilot area... Are you sure about that? Excuse me? Are you sure the Agency issued an authorization? Of course. Why else would I be here? It starts with this small area... What about the date of implementation? The thing is... After we canvass the residents' opinion and find no major issues, the plan will be implemented two months after. From that point... So, you got the green light and have the dates but nothing is concrete. More or less. Let's call for a meeting. Let's get out of here. There's nothing more to hear. Come on. Hey, wait! Please don't leave. Hello? You put too many nails in the wall. Sorry, I'll take them out. I'm sorry to ask for a raise on such short notice. Sure. When can you get the money? Ma'am... we're in a tight spot as it is. I'm terribly sorry but can I give you a raise next year? I promise. But I need the money now. Can you excuse me for a second? Hey, did you miss mommy? There's a good girl. I want to put my house on the market. Sooner the better. Maseok-dong designated as an urban renewal area! Home price skyrockets! Will Maseok be the last 'land of miracle?' Everyone, I've been living in this town for 30 years now. By providing free counseling during the day and representing residents' committee by night, I have devoted myself to serving this community. And what did I get in return? There's just one thing. It's you. My neighbors. More precious than my own blood relatives. Am I the only one to think that? No. Thank you. Thank you. At last, we got the green light on redevelopment. I don't understand how this happened but when it was us who fought for the designation, it's those few houses on the hill who were given the priority. That's right. We aren't included in this redevelopment. I called for this meeting because Sergeant Major CHOI has a proposition that he'd like to share with us. Sergeant Major? I have led countless fights for the sake of this country. There is one thing I learned from my experience of leading hundreds of protests. That is, if you want something you must tell them that you want it. So, I challenge you to rise and unite in protest and show them who we are. A protest? But that's scary. I'm not proposing anything grand. What's a protest after all? It's making our voice heard. Once designated, we'll all earn hundreds of thousands of dollars. We need to be more assertive. Okay. Since we're busy people, let's put it to the vote whether we want to go with the protest or not. How about that? Those who oppose it, raise your hands. Now, those who support it? We have more yeses. So we're going ahead with the protest, then. It's like you have won the lottery if the decision is finalized. It's true that we got the green light. What you read in the papers is also correct. So is everything you just said. It's just that... there is a bit of resistance from some residents. Down with discriminatory redevelopment plan! Daddy, I need my own room. After we redevelop, honey! These people are demanding that we redevelop the whole town. But what they don't get is if they stir up an issue out of it, the whole thing could be called off. I know the situation you're in. Let me help you out. Sell your house to me. Collect signatures from the residents. If you submit it to the Agency, that becomes public opinion. Forget protests. This is concrete. We could conduct this ourselves. But it's best for us to handle this discreetly. I mean, after all, it's people like you who benefit the most from this. Shouldn't you take the initiative at a time like this? Especially with your circumstances. Once you have the signatures, we'll help you from there. Boss, I have an urgent family matter. Can I take few more weeks off? Please? Let me introduce you to each other. This is Sergeant Major CHOI. He is a retired marine sergeant major. Do you know what a sergeant major is? Never mind. Just call him 'Sergeant Major.' This is KIM Hyeong-seok. He runs a dry cleaner's. It's an honor to meet you. No need to be stiff and formal. What should we call him? We should give him an appropriate title. How about a 'president?' President of the youth club. President KIM. That's perfect. Thank you. Hi! Hey, can you bring over two packs of diapers? What can I get you? I'm here to collect your signature... For what? Thank you for shopping with us! Signature for what? For those living on the hill... the living condition is terrible. The street lights need repair and some buildings, too... Instant noodles again? Get yourself a wife. If I collect enough signatures and bring it to the council... Jeez, can't you see I'm busy? Give me that. Here. Happy now? Thank you. We'll fight to death for fair redevelopment! Hello, I'm from the borough office to get your signature. You're from the borough office? Who are you? Who sent you? Sorry? Don't lie to me. There is no name of the borough on the cover. Do you know who I am? Who put you up to this? Nobody! Do you think you can fool me? Speak already. Who put you up to this? My house is in the pilot area. No one put me up to this. So your house is being redeveloped? Good for you... You rotten, self-centered bitch! What's your problem? Do you know who I am? I'm the one leading the protest against renewal, silly bitch! How dare you walk into my house with this? If I catch you with this paper again, I swear I'll break your neck. Got that? Hello? I just wanted to ask you... You know the forms you gave me for signatures? They got a little crumpled. I was wondering if it's still acceptable. Pardon me? I have to get them again? But... it's just a little crumple. I think I can cellotape them back together. Is there any way? What...? I have to start over? Damn it... No, it's nothing. Okay... Yeah. Hello? It's me. Hello, Sergeant Major. Don't go out of your way to collect everyone's signature. If you can get half of them, that's enough. You don't want to provoke them and attract unnecessary attention. That's why we're lying low. Because we don't want to give them an excuse. By the way, do you know the name of the man who ripped the forms? It's best to keep away from those with aggressive temper. Oh and... this woman here. Don't get her signature either. She is the mastermind behind the protesters. And oh man, does she have a temper! In any case, don't take unnecessary risks. - Hey. - Yes, sir. How long after she left the building? About 12 minutes. I don't think it was an arson. It looks like somebody shot something into the building. Shoot? Like... with a bazooka? Do any of you know what happened? He burned himself to death in protest. All of you here... Don't you feel you owe him? Is this really the best we can do? From now, do not contact me until I call you. Okay? Yes, ma'am. What did I just say? Not to call you first. How's your mother? She's better. From now, take just one pill a day. Not three times? How's your anger management going? Well, you know... It's better. Then go down to one pill. Yes, ma'am. If we pull this off, you don't have to worry about your mother. You can continue living with her. Okay? Okay. It'll all work out for the best. Are we invisible to you? Are we invisible to you? Discriminatory policy aggravates division! Are we invisible to you? Down with selective renewal plan! Down with selective renewal plan! Discriminatory policy aggravates division! Down with selective renewal plan! Down with selective renewal plan! Discriminatory policy aggravates division! Down with selective renewal plan! Down with selective renewal plan! 18 dollars 90, please. Hey... Did you sign in favor of redevelopment? What? Sorry? Some woman came for your signature. I don't think so. Yes, you signed... you double-crossing bitch! That's her! If this is comfortable, you can stay like this a bit more. When you wake up, you just have to live longer than others. You killed him, didn't you? Did you kill him? What about an accomplice? No accomplice? Listen. Stay here until the final decision is announced. It could be another month or two... Just stay here until then. Once the decision is officialized, I'll let you go. No. My husband is in hospital. I said I would let you go eventually! I didn't mean to kill him. I'm not blaming you for that. Mister. Please! Hello? Working here is that bad? This really isn't right for me. I should've found a job as a factory worker. By the way, how old do you have to be to need a hearing aid? I'm only three years older than you. Can I try it out? Can you hear me? How long has it been? Just over two weeks. Eat up. I gotta go to the hospital. There's no one to look after my husband. I said after the final decision is announced. Besides, it's not your husband you should be worrying about. Depending on the outcome of the campaign, I'm thinking about turning you in to the police. To the police? You killed a man. I'm telling you I really didn't mean to do it. Why should that matter? Can you look at me for a second? Why...? Fucking bitch! I'm sorry I got held up with some work. This really shouldn't happen again, should it? Ms. JEONG Su-nam, do you know a man called CHOI Do-cheol? No. You really don't know this man? No, sorry. Excuse me. This is you, right? I don't think so. You know it's you. What were you doing there? Collecting the bill, I think. Bill? For what? I deliver newspapers. I see. You deliver to that building? No, not to that building. Does this seem like a joke to you? What are you playing at? We're looking for a suspect in arson. Perhaps you're nervous and feeling confused. But we need you to focus. I really can't remember. Ma'am, we're not accusing you of anything. We're looking for a suspect. So, no need to feel nervous. Just think carefully before you answer. Okay? What were you doing there on the day of the explosion? I really can't remember because I've been busy. What were you doing that afternoon? At what time? Will it help you remember if I tell you the time? No, but... I usually work in a restaurant in the evening. In a restaurant? As a delivery woman? No, I work in the kitchen. I see. I thought you delivered hence the scooter. I deliver newspapers and distribute business cards. Occasionally, I clean apartments when there is work. You do all that by yourself? I need the money. It seemed that you didn't come home for few days. Did you go somewhere? Yes. Where did you go with all that work? To the sea. To the sea? On your scooter? Yes. Look. We can verify with toll booths. Did you really go to the sea? Yes. Is there anyone who can vouch for that? No. What about your husband? Aren't you married? He's in the hospital. He's in a coma. Are you really going to pull records from toll booths? How can a scooter pass through a toll booth? Have you ever see a scooter on the highway? Anyway, doesn't she seem suspicious to you? Not so much a suspicion, I feel pity for her. It's always the desperate ones that resort to crime. That's why she is suspicious. Some amazing things have happened recently. I'll tell you all about it when you wake up. You might be disappointed. But I'll still tell you everything. Hello? Anybody? Nurse! In here! It's a spasm that commonly occurs in comatose patients. You can't hang on to hope over things like this. I can pay off the bill real soon. I mean it. Just a little more time. So, tell me the truth. If a doctor lies about the patient's condition, he gets fired from the hospital. I assure you, this is nothing more than a muscle spasm. He got better, didn't he? I told you, it's a spasm. He is better, isn't he? No. But he's moving his foot. It's true, there is a movement in his foot. But like I said, it's merely a spasm. Doctor, I'll do everything you want me to do. I'll do anything you tell me. So, please be straight with me. Do you remember what we talked about last time? Have you given it some thought? About Death with Dignity? I thought you had given up. Where have you been, not collecting signatures? They've been busy organizing protests and all. It's too late now. We still have a few more days. Is it really that bad? The woman leading the protest is incredibly stubborn. She's no match to you. Let's forget this ever happened. So, if I just stop the protest... Sure. With high protein and low fat content, Fugu is the luxurious delicacy that is worth the risk of death for the flavour. This is not a mere metaphor. Fugu contains tetrodotoxin, a poisonous substance. Tetrodotoxin, the most dangerous and deadliest poison in the natural world. Here is the simple way to examine yourself if you had accidentally consumed the toxin. About half an hour after eating: hands and feet go numb, and nausea - a sort of drunken feeling; general paralysis and oral paresthesias for about an hour; which is followed by fall in blood pressure and respiratory failure. Luckily you are still fully conscious while experiencing these. But don't be adventurous - do not try it. There is no substance for neutralising the puffer fish toxin. I'm sorry. So, I hope you understand why I have to kill you. Sir, we'll need to do an autopsy but it looks like she's poisoned. Poisoned? Yes... and this here is the trace of her vomit. What about surveillance footage? They have no surveillance cameras to protect the privacy of the visitors to the center. Hey, isn't this blood? It's sour chilli sauce. It'll take some time to identify the poison because they have to compare manually. Any development in the arson case? Nothing really... Sir. Look into that woman, JEONG Su-nam. I can't shake the suspicion. Look. She was there at the crime scene. Then, she fired something. What did she use? Man, what was that? No more living in dog houses! Congratulations! Redevelopment confirmed! Chapter 3 - Honeymoon I don't know if you'll like it or hate it when you wake up and read this. I just hope you won't be disappointed. I love you. It must feel cramped to live here. No, I'm used to it. You own a house elsewhere. Why do you live here? Because I have no money. Of course. I asked you the obvious. You said your husband was in the hospital. That must cost a lot. But you'll come into some money with the redevelopment. I don't really know about things like that. I heard that you've been collecting signatures from the residents. The borough office pestered me to help. What were the signatures for? Supporting redevelopment. Hey, you gotta stop lying to me, okay? I can make them call off the whole thing altogether. If I inform the Agency about what you... You can't. My husband is waking up soon. Is everything alright? I heard you paid off the bill in full. Why don't you give it another thought? No. I've given it enough thought. I have a heavy heart for some reason. I feel somewhat bad, too. That's okay.
