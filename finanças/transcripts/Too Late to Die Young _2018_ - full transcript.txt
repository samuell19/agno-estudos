Go home! There she comes. C'mon Frida! Frida! - Hi - Hi Clara Come on up! It was my turn to go in the front. Stop it. What time is your class' play? I told you not to go, mom's coming. Yeah, sure. - Hello, hello! - Hi. Your backpack, sweetie! - Last day of school. - Yeah. Here's your snack. C'mon... - Hey. - Hi. Hey. - Bye mom. - Bye! Bye. - Bye, thanks! - Bye. Look. She's right behind us. TOO LATE TO DIE YOUNG I'll have one of those vacuum cleaners, the ones that work on their own. How? There's no power. Not going to live here. I'll have a shipping container... To live on my own up here. Kinda dull right? Living alone. You can come. We could sleep here after New Year's. - Want some? - Nope. My mom tells me that if I keep smoking I'll stay short. You're such a nerd. No. No. Frida! Smoke! No! I won't! Stop! Hi! - Hi! How are you doing? - Good. Dad! - Can I move the car? - What? Can I move the car? No. Take the radio. I'll do it. Can I try it? Hey sweetie... Where's Carmen? Hello my friend! The construction is looking good! - Carmen! - Hi! Come. Well... This is my Christmas present to welcome you to the community. With a lot of love for you and your family. - Do you like it? - Thank you. - Really? - I love it! - Oh, I'm glad! - It's great! Careful, it's still wet! I just finished it. Jaime, come! Look! We'll have to put it up when we have walls though. Sofía! Is your dog back? No. - It's great! - What a bike! We didn't buy it, it was a gift from my parents. They painted my old one for Jose. He didn't even notice. Of course he did. - Did you notice or not? - What? Nothing, what would he notice if he doesn't have a clue? - Of course he did. - No, he didn't. - Pass me the light. - How many have you had? Last one. Well, look. Our plots are between the raspberry orchard here and this one. So, if ten owners agree, We'd have to pay for the line and... What is it... The meter. - No, the converter. - That's it. The converter. And then, the company installs a meter on each plot. How would it reach the houses? From the main road to the small ones, people can get on board or not. We'd have to pay individually. The thing is I'm further up, so I'll surely pay more. Well, that's why we're talking about it, if we do it as a group, or individually, or if someone needs it, maybe we can all help them. Exactly. And who decided that the line had to enter on that corner? We will see the posts and cables. The deal with the company is everything goes underground. Yes, exactly. Look, let's do this right. Let's just vote. We won't see the stars, also. Well, if you don't want power don't have it, the point is bigger than that. - We could have a washing machine. - Why would I want one... You know why it's important? Because of the water pumps. - Because of the fires. - Exactly. Everything's under control for now, but a small breeze comes in... It all goes to hell. Wait, I only rent here... I told you. Now that we could have power, they don't want it. They never will. Sofía! Put it out. C'mon. Dad, I'm a smoker. It's not from time to time, I smoke. I'm addicted already. End of discussion. Sofía! I found it on the street market. It made me think of you. Do you like it? I love it. It's very me. Glad you like it. - Is your mom coming for New Year's? - I don't know. Tell her to come. The party is going to be at my place. She can sing, we'll have some fun... - Yeah? - Of course! Ask your dad. That's why it reached the raspberries so fast. They couldn't stop it. They couldn't stop the fire. That's bad, man, that's bad. We're going up to look for underground water with Alejandro. Frida! Sometimes she comes here to mess with the horses. Frida! Don't drink the water! There's a dead horse up in the ravine! Let's go find the dog. Frida! Frida! Food is ready. Come eat, kids. Food's ready. Bring your own plate and help yourselves. Hand me a plate, please? No, no. Simón! Simón! - Hey, Simón, no, no! - Easy! There, easy. Sit there. Jaime? Are you okay? Laura, serve some food to your brother! Can I have more wine? - Hi Ignacio! - Hi! Hello hello! Carmen! Welcome! Once kicked, no reprisals! Merry Christmas. I owe you a gift bro. - Did you leave your stuff at home? - Yeah. It was open. - All good? - Yeah. Thanks. Attention! I want to read the invite to our New Year's party to all of you. Well, our house will be open from 9pm. If you arrive hungry, it's all good. Okay? Songs must be prepared, instruments must be installed on time. You have to come in a rigorously fantastic attire. Ladies and gentlemen Leave the dogs tied up, and cows... don't matter. Cheers! Here's to having a great time and starting a beautiful New Year. I have my song ready! Darling, you already know, when I sing, the dogs start to howl. And glasses break. Hey, you have to do a nice show, not that dumb stuff you pulled last year. - He's on probation. - Thanks. - One for the prettiest. - Thank you. Thank you very much. Hey Sofía... - Did you pick your song? - No. - I didn't recognize you up there. - No? You're older. - Here. - That's such an arbitrary rule. "Over fifteen". That doesn't exist. Over eighteen, twenty one maybe. Hey, no. If it reaches up there, we're fucked. Does anyone have a scar? I have a scar, but you can barely see it. I like the ones you can see... and touch. Look at this one. - What's that? - That must've hurt. What happened to you? I was coming back from Mendoza on my motorbike... The pavement was... The pavement was slippery, I lost control... I got this piece of metal in there, but I just had to pull it together, and go forward. - It doesn't hurt. - What a scar! It's just ugly now. Someone has any cigarettes left? Okay. I'm going home. See you there. - Bye bye. Have a good one. - Bye. Will you be here for New Year's? - We wrote some songs. - Yeah, they're ours. - For real? You wrote them? - Yeah, we're rehearsing. Cool. I don't know yet if I'll be here, I have to see. Anyone knows the little devil? A band? No, it's for drinking and smoking at the same time. You open the box in the corner, to drink normally, but then you also make another hole, to put a cigarette, and then you light it up, it shouldn't touch the liquid, and then you smoke and you drink at the same time. Neat. Awesome. I'm gonna go get some cigarettes. Wanna join me? - Bye. - Bye Sofía. Come on. Pass the guitar. "Buying cigarettes" they call it now. Santiago's gross. How did you get up here? It took us like, two hours... No one took us because of our looks. Classic. I'm going to live in Ñuñoa with a friend We want to open a... - a travel agency. - Yeah? I might move there too. Really? Why? My mom lives in Ñuñoa They're finishing the pool at the beach house, R. Cool, R. I'm buying a float with a hole to put my glass of whiskey, R. R. Granny says your dad should take care of himself and drink lots of water. She sends you a kiss. And another for Frida. R. Ok. Let's go. I'm happy to be here. But I'm also happy when I leave. After New Year's, I'll take my things and move to my mom's. - You look just like her. - Yeah? Is it weed? Can I get a puff? I saw her play like a week ago. At the Café del Cerro. Do you know that place? The bass player who plays with her, I met him. He's very good. He's her boyfriend. I saw her on TV the other time, giving an interview about the new record. Great. Did you see that? We have no electricity! My dad doesn't want a generator either. Alright, bye. Bye. What? He's talking about the wood, maybe. - Maple or fir tree? - Yes, fir tree. No, those are European woods. I use larch and Raulí. Those are from here. Lows. - Yes. - Low? The sound? Yeah. We put up signs all over the place. She will show up. I didn't tell anything about her to grandpa. Tomorrow. They gave her to me. I don't want her to die... Sing to me and I'll give you the dummy, ok? Ok. Ok, the Cucu song now. Now, happy birthday. Sing "I want to be a Care Bear". - I liked that one a lot. - Now "the White Horse". She sang it already. Say, I love you mom... How do you say it? I love you... I love you Queco. - What? - I love you Queco. I love you Queco. Too high? How is it going with the adobe Raul? So-so... There's not enough water. You can't start tomorrow, then? I'll go up to check the intake. Yes, please. It tore its leg. First it bit the leg, and then the neck. It was lying in the river, covered in blood. - It's so heavy that it's stuck. - Where is the horse? Up there. Up in the mountain. - Let's go see it? - No, it's too far. Seems fake to me. I don't think that a dog can kill a horse. Maybe it was Frida. - I don't think so, she had already left. - That's why. Remember when she was killing those birds? Also, she is like this wild breed. Dad! What? Is it true? - What? - The horse. Yeah. They took it away. See? It was true. Okay, let's go. - Let's go? - Let's go. The party is at Elena's place. You have to sing? Oh, great! Hey! We can have dinner at home and then go. It was boring. It doesn't matter. I had to play as a man... Yeah, because of the hair. None of the girls wanted to. Alright mom. See you on New Year's. It's your turn to go in the back. No! Come on, move! Dad, José got a Citroen Tortoise. It even has a gear shift and everything. He's a kid, how is he gonna drive? It's true. Here? Not here. Only where the dirt road begins. You should complain to Santa. I've been asking for the quad bike since I was four! - Stop it, dad gave you the hair gel. - Right. Mom's coming for New Year's. Elena invited her. Liar, you did. She told me she was coming, that they invited her. I didn't know. Let's have dinner at home. This guy's gonna kill himself going that fast... Shift to second gear. - Come on, hurry up! - We're coming! - I'm slow. - Let's race! Hey, don't! - Let's race? - Santiago! He doesn't want to get in. Lucas, do you want some watermelon? You're lucky to have water Elena. Someone blocked our hose. How? I don't know, they opened the box and blocked it. Who could it be? It can't be someone from here. I don't know. - You have those keys, right? - Yes. But it was open. It was an outsider, for sure. How is Jaime doing? It looks like it was the water. We didn't know we had to boil it during summer. Oh yeah, you have to. People go to the river for a swim, they leave trash... I love that people go swim in the river. Do you know what you're singing? - It's so embarrassing. - C'mon, you're an actress. But not a singer. Mom, don't be a liar... You've been rehearsing with Cristóbal. See? - Alright, who wants watermelon? - Me! - Outside the pool. - Thank you. I want some. So? No. There's no water here. Dad! What if we go further up? Up the ravine. Dad! Dad! Sofía! Is it working? Yeah, it's on. - Look outside! - What?! Look outside. There's someone interested in the viola. Okay. If I sell it, I can give you some money for your vacation. Hey! How are you doing? Come on down. I can't right now, later. Watch out for those cables. - ...It's nice people. - Yeah. Yeah I know them, too hippies though. - You like the pregnant girl. - No... - Hold the bottle! - It's empty, look. Luckily. You had this same shit last year. We drank the same thing. Let's make piscolas and then we go down. I'll go look for them down the road. I bet they are lost. The thorns look pretty good. Yeah. Miguel, stop dancing. Help me. Ready! Come on, throw it! Carmen! - Hi! - Can you come for a second? I'm coming. What happened? Everything okay around here? Can you come with me? - Of course. - This way. Why did they break it? I don't know. It's always open, I've never locked it. They took my camera and... some Guayasamin copies I had, but they're worthless. The dogs didn't bark? Raul? I don't think so. Raul is trustworthy. Ignacio? Can you take me for a ride? I have to leave a complaint with the police. Some other time, okay? We could put a collar around his neck, with the name "Survive". - They sell them at the street market.. - You're right! They are for dogs, but it doesn't matter. I saw them once. - Get out! - José... let's go. Whatever. Let's go. Leave! So mean! Come on! Let's go! What's with the chicken? It's called Survive. He got the name because he was the only survivor from a dog attack. Bummer with the break-in. Did you see the door? Did you find out anything else? The cops know who they are, but they don't do shit. Nice jeep. It's all dirty. Looks like the Ñuñoa thing is going to work out. Huh? - Moving there, with my mom. - Cool! She's coming for New Year's too. I'll leave with her then. Great. Excuse me. It's very nice. Let's go? - Let's go! - Where to? Why did you take the car? Dad's looking for you. If you bring a car's battery, you can have some power. Yes, I brought a mattress too. Are you going to live here? - I'll sleep here tomorrow. - Alone? You have to release the clutch softly. I know. I've been driving for a while... Since I was little. What's up? You got distracted. What does your dad say about you moving to Ñuñoa? I don't care. Haven't told him. See you tomorrow at the party? I have this other party in Santiago... But... After the robbery I'm not sure if I'm going. - Yeah. - I'll have to see. Hope to see you. Bye. - Is it clean? - Yes, it's not blocked. - Ok. - Maybe it's bent further up. No, they unplug them up there, and then connect it to their supply. Grab this. Whose is it? We have to be awake till' dawn. Of course. We have to last. I was eighteen. And he... Thirty-something... I can't say I didn't enjoy my youth. - No? - No. What's important is not getting pregnant. What about that one? - That one? - Yes. Do you like it? Yes. There's something to it. - It's darker. - Yes. I have to deliver it on Monday. If they don't like it, I'll take it back. - No, I love it. - Really? Yes. Thanks. Could you let me practice? You can teach me... I don't know how. I kinda just do it. My mom tells me she'll never lend me her car because I'll drink... I'll drive drunk and kill myself. Someday I'll have to learn how to drive well. Sure. Your dad's a car guy, he should teach you. Fuck! Ignore them. What? Don't look. It's alright. Come on, don't look! Wanna go to the treehouse after the party? I bought batteries for my radio. We could wait for the sunrise... Can you? Depends on my mom. I'm going to burn the bad songs I wrote. So that there's no trace left. What a nerd. Dad! Need help? No, it's done. Go help mom. - Leave them there. - Okay. - Mom! - What? There are no wine cups left! Why didn't you ask grandma? It's doesn't matter! We have glasses, we have mugs... - Lucas, give me a hand. - Ok dad, just a second. - Do you have peppercorn? - Yes - Can Santiago stay for dinner? - Sure! Tell your dad, so we can all eat together! I can't, my mom is coming - You're dining with Antonia? - I have to go cook. Cool. - We'll come later. - Yeah, you have to. Lentils for abundance. Argentinian tradition. - Tasty! - Come with me. Awesome. Who said that man brought music to the world? Wasn't the sea singing? Is Sofía coming? She's hot... What do you see in her? She's just hot. Special. "Special" are people with problems. Are you jealous? This guy doesn't even know how to kiss. What do you know about that? What the fuck? You crazy girl. Fucking dehydrated kiss. Damn. I think I saw her. - Yes? Where? - Near my house. Are you sure? Nobody has dogs like that around there. Can you come with me? Here. Here? There it is. - I'll give you a sign. - Okay. María! Hi. Hello. We lost that dog a few days ago. This is my dog... Just ask around. It's my daughter's. We've been looking for her everywhere. Everybody here knows her. Cindy! Come! Cindy! Come! Over here. My daughter named her. - Please, accept this. - That's not it. María... You know me, I know you. Just take the money and hand the dog over. Hand it over, quick. Let's go in. Go inside. Thank you. Don't take it the wrong way. No! Stay calm, quiet. They're not taking her, they're just going for a walk. My daughter is who's going to be sick. Why are they taking her? Go home boys! Hey, can we have your autograph? Okay. We better leave fast. - What's your names? - Where are you going?! - Carla. - Carla? Cata. Bye Cindy! How can I help? - Take a bath. - Okay. Come on, take those things off the table. No, I prefer the cold towels over that. - No. - Get out! Not here. Down. Frida. Frida. Frida. Don't go there, Frida! Cindy. We're going to the party. - Miguel! - Frida! - Frida! - The dog! Come here! Frida! Frida! Hey! Raul! Get her! Miguel! Firm, extra firm, megahold. The best formula for docile hair and styles that don't need extreme hold. Yeah, you look like an old man. Take a bath. It got cold. Pass your dish? Let's just eat. Hey! I'm going to live with mom. She's coming to the party, then I'm going down with her. Alright then. Leave. I want to live with her. You only care about your things. - No. - See? That's why she left you. You never say anything. What? Did you ask her if she wanted to live with you? Let's give an applause to the singers, please. Hello. Hi. Hello! Good night. I present to you... Saryan Band! One... Two... Three... And... Look how... the sun melts... Far away... Far away... How's Jaime? - He's doing better. - Great! - I'll just stay for a little while. - But he's sleeping, right? My dear! Your mom? I don't know. Hasn't she arrived? No, but I think she'll be here later. She didn't arrive for dinner. They were supposed to come after. Poor Sofía. Antonia's coming? She's a disgrace. Well, you're not so perfect yourself. You're annoying. Welcome! Can I have a puff? Get out of here, you're too little. Only on the outside. Come on, just a little. Eight! Seven! Six! Five! Four! Three! Two! One! Happy new year! Happy new year, Sofía. Happy new year. Happy new year. Happy new year! Happy new year! Hey! Happy new year! Hey, you shouldn't be drinking! Stop! What happened? - What? - I'm going outside. Hey... Let's go a bit further. Okay. Alright, so who's got the stuff? You're going to start the car? Damn! Clara! Lucas. Come on, man, come! What's the matter? Nothing. Your mom may come later. - What's up? - Hey, who were those guys? I don't know. They came with Ignacio. Must be his friends. They were snorting coke, in the car. - Really? - Seriously? - I saw them. - Take it. Damn. - I didn't see them with him. - He sniffed too. I didn't see him with anyone. You didn't see them? - Sofía, it's your turn to sing! - Sofía! C'mon, come! Her mom didn't come then? - I don't think so. - I thought her mom was playing. - Cut it out! - Come on, why are you like that? The Romeo, the Romeo! - He's taking the bottle. - Go with your girlfriend. Some time ago I met two ladies... with bad luck in love... I spoke to them of love and marriage... and in no time I arrived with them to the altar... I hear you when you turn on the water... 'cause I can hear it from my room, and... only then I feel like getting out of bed. - That's it. - Yeah? Then I grab my coffee... I go out... And I see you. You take your time watering the lemon verbena and the laurel... The lemon verbena is very dry... - You're so beautiful. - It's your turn to sing Carmen... Cristobal... Let's give it up for the singers. Can I do one? Yeah. It went off on my finger! Sorry. Two years old he must've been... and we were here. - Carlos. - Huh? Here. - Mom, have you seen Sofía? - Wait, shut up. He was coming right there, walking... and he stood up... and he fell. He stood and, poof!, he fell again. So... - Antonia, Sofía's mom - Yeah, mom... Listen. Antonia says to me: "Hey, Elena... didn't Lucas knows how to walk?" So, me and your dad realized... that this little bird from heaven... had drank all the remnants in the glasses left at the party, and he was... completely drunk. - Yeah, I remember. - Were you there? No. You weren't there. You didn't exist here. You hadn't appeared yet. - Dad, you're an asshole! - What? Where were you? I went to see some friends nearby. Can I go down with you? My mom didn't show up, and my dad kicked me out of the house. I don't know... - What's up? - I'm going down. Want to join me? - Let's go. - Sure man. Hey. Hey, the bottle! - Hey! - Hey, don't be a thief! Who are you calling a thief, man? - Let's go! - You stole it, didn't you? - Ok, stay calm. - Stop them! - Go home, fucking brat! - Stop! Lucas! Hey, stop! Stop man! Ok, no, don't! Motherfucker! It's bleeding less now. Careful. Shift to first. That's it. - Clara! Laura! - There they are! Let's go home. - I'm not sleepy. - Me neither. Laura. Hurry up! Sofía! Sofía? Sofía. Hey... Stop already! Let's go. I'm leaving with my mom. She didn't show up. What did you do to yourself? Leave it. You did that stuff again. Leave me alone. You won't see me again. Lucas. Lucas! - Stop looking for that asshole! - I'm not looking for him! Let's go then. Sofía! Dad, come down! Dad! What? There's a fire! Come down quick! I was falling asleep. - Is it ugly? - Damn, mom. How did you fall? Will they ask me too much? - You won't be able to leave the house. - That's mean. - Does it hurt? - I don't feel anything. You're so mindless. - Mom! - What? There's a fire! Everything is burning down! Where?! On the hill! It is burning! There, up the hill! Lucas! Kids! Hurry up! Ok, let's go! - Have you seen Sofía? - No. - Okay. - Hurry up, José! - Grab that! - Ok, pass it. A lot of people are already there, you better stay! Don't move! I'm going to get her, she must be close Ok, go. Carmen! We're on our way! Clara! Put the carpet there! I need more help here! Water! Come here! Sofía! Come on! Come, get in! Listen to me! Come on. Come! Hello? Anyone there? Sofía! Clara! Higher up, everyone! Mom! - Get out! - And my dad? Hurry up! It's spreading to the orchard! To the ravine! Sofía! Sofía! Hey! Please, more water over here! Lucas, the treehouse! Clara. Dad!
