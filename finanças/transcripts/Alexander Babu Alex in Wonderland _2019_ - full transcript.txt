Good singing along, give yourselves a round of applause. Thank you so much guys! We’ll take care of this big little baby here. OK… So, Ladies and Gentlemen, today is no normal day. That’s for sure. Today is a very special day and this show is a very very very special show! You might be thinking, I say this in every show. But, the difference is, today, I mean it. Yeah. We are filming this show for Amazon Prime, everybody! Thank you for bringing me this far! Thank you! Thank you so much! And I know, for sure, some of you are watching this show for the second time, or even the third time. Quick show of hands, repeat audience! Thank you so much! I’m honored. I’m overwhelmed. I’m also scared. I hope none of you are surprised by the fact that it is the same show. He’s singing the same song, dude. What is happening? Baadsha (a popular Rajini movie in Tamil) is the same every time you watch it, no? Our new show will have a different title. So, look out for that. Thank you so much. Here is my humble request for all the repeat audience, Forget the fact that you watched already. Just take it off your mind! That way, it’s good for you. Definitely good for me. And is definitely definitely good for your neighbors. Because there will be this urge to prompt. Now see, one old song will come! Don't do that. This segment will be nice, you watch! It may not be worth it after this, we can leave! NO. Don’t do that! Don’t do that today! Sometimes I will pause, just to build that momentum and all. Don’t think, I forgot. Ok? If I need help, I’ll ask, I’ll reach out to you guys. Yeah? Thank you so much guys! Very nice. So, this is a standup comedy show in Tanglish (Tamil + English)! So, all the Tamilians will feel, why so much English, what’s the point? All the non-Tamilians will feel, why so much Tamil, what’s the point? So, that’s how it works. Anybody here who cannot follow Tamil? (Checks for audience who cannot understand Tamil) Nice, forever you may hold your peace. In case you are there, just a disclaimer. There will be 20% of Tamil in the first half, And the second half maybe, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70% Tamil. That’s all! My humble request is, stick around, don’t give up. OK? Just stick around till the end, you’ll get the hang of it. Second half will be a little difficult, I acknowledge. I totally agree. But, as we say in Tamil, as time goes, everything will be fine. For any big problem, we Tamilians have this one solution. Over time, everything will be alright. How much time is that overtime, we don’t know. It maybe seconds. It maybe minutes. It maybe hours. It maybe days, weeks, months, years! It maybe multiple births also! But, all of us know for sure, Over time, everything will be alright. So, stick around. In case, you can't follow tamil. I can potentially do the whole show in English also, that’s possible. But, as you would have gathered by now, My English also sounds like Tamil only? So, it won’t make much of a difference. Even if I do complete English, You might still say, you could have done some more in English. It’s been very special, guys! Those who are seeing me for the first time, My name is Alexander Babu. I’m a standup comedian. I’m also a Yoga teacher, by the way. Doing these things full time, God’s grace, for the past four years now! It is amazing! Yeah. Thank you! And before that I used to be a Software Engineer. You might not have heard about ‘Software Engineer’, no? One of those rare species one earth, especially in South India! I used to be a Software Engineer. But from childhood, from school days, I always wanted this, man. Always wanted to be on stage. I wanted to be an entertainer. I wanted to be like CRAZY MOHAN. I wanted to be like VIVEK. I wanted to be a singer. I wanted to be a musician. I wanted all those crazy things in the world. That’s why promptly after my school days, I joined engineering college. Because early 90’s, everybody joined an engineering college only. All my friends said, if you get engineering, no second thoughts. All of us joined engineering college. After Bachelor’s in engineering college here in Chennai, I went to the US to do Masters in Engineering. I had no clue why I did Bachelor’s in Engineering! Because mid 90’s there were so many opportunities in the USA. My friends said ‘You get a call from the US. Are you crazy? Get going, man!’ All of us went to the US. So I became a Software Engineer with Masters degree. Then I went to the Bay Area, California and joined a start-up company. Because, late 90s, if you’re a Software Engineer, you HAVE to go to the Bay Area, And join one start-up company and become a millionaire. That was the only option available. I was there for a good five, six years, man. But before I could become a millionaire and all that, That’s when this urge to become an artist, This art madness got to me. It became very intense. I couldn’t take it anymore. Also all my friends said, Bro, you should not be here. You should go back home. You should go back to Chennai. Follow your heart and pursue your passion. They all stayed back. I moved to Chennai. I joined Amazon. Just continued as a Software Engineer for another 10 years! Nothing happened. Then this thing happened, man. One fine morning, about 4 years ago,, 3 and a half, 4 years ago, I woke up and I realized, I turned 40! Now, don’t do the math and all. People are like Forty plus Four. Forty four. Oh, this guy is 44. Forty plus four is forty four. I know ya! I turned 40 that day. That’s when I realized, it is either now or never. The later and all might never come, who knows right? So, that day I went to work; I quit my job; Started doing standup comedy. I went for my Yoga teacher certification. The next three and a half to four years, I’ve no idea. I just went with the flow, trusted life, You guys got me here! Thank you so much! Wonderland belongs to all of you! It’s been an amazing three hand a half, four years, man away from the corporate life. That did not work for me. Interestingly, on day one I knew, First day, first job, I joined. That day, I knew. something told me this is not for me. Corporate life is not for me. I even called my father that day.. Dad, I don’t like this job and all. He was like, what do you mean you don’t like the job? Over time, it will be all be ok. I believed him for fifteen years, man! Every year I’ll think, Maybe next year, maybe next year. I’ll be honest, man. I don’t think, I enjoyed work even for a single day. For fifteen years, I don’t think I enjoyed even a single day at work. But, I can confidently say, I have generally been very happy in life. God’s grace. I can confidently say, I’ve generally been very happy in life. And I very often try to reflect. What is that one thing that gives me happiness? Because, when you’re forty, three, four, little bit, There are so many things that come and go. Some will come, give you happiness. Next moment, something else will come, take away the happiness. But, this ONE thing, I’ll tell you what that is. This ONE thing has always stayed with me, from childhood, until today. Even before coming on stage, This is the only thing that stays with me, stayed with me, giving me happiness every single moment, man. That one thing, that beautiful thing, has always been MUSIC! Always been MUSIC! God’s gift, man. God’s gift. In ALICE IN WONDERLAND story, how many of you read that story? Alice in Wonderland story? Yeah? So, we are connecting with the title. Kindly make a note, eh. Because, when we debuted the show, here in Chennai only, One uncle at the end of the show was very upset. The title was never mentioned in the show! What is this? There was no coherence to the whole story. What was the point? You could have just called it “Jokes”! Okay… So here we go! In Alice in Wonderland story, The girl falls into a rabbit hole. Alice falls into a rabbit hole, she finds her Wonderland right there. I firmly believe, for me, I’m sure for most of you, Maybe for all of us or, I very often tend to think, for mankind itself, For mankind, the God given rabbit hole is MUSIC man. God given rabbit hole, I think is music only. Nothing else. You go into music, you fall into music, You find your Wonderland. You’ll find your Wonderland. And when I say music, I grew up in this small village called ANDAVOORANI in RAMANATHAPURAM district. Anybody from Ramnad district? At least for moral support you should say yes, what is this? Ok.. Thank you very much! I grew up in a small village. When I say music, I am talking about whatever music I heard in ALL INDIA RADIO, CEYLON RADIO at that time. Or the TUBE RADIOs (loud speakers) we’ll have in all the village functions, temples and everywhere. TAMIL FILM MUSIC PathSarathSwamSabha and all happened much later in life. Tamil film music, don’t you think, is filled with wonders and wonders and wonders and endless wonders?! Don’t you think? And when we talk about wonders in music, Don’t you think, we have to start with wonders of all wonders, called MAESTRO ILAYARAJA? During those fifteen years of corporate life, every day after I go home, You know the first thing I’ll do? I switch on an Ilayaraja song. (hums Naan Thedum from Dharma Pathini by Ilayaraja) Not even ten seconds would have finished. Just the humming has finished. I’ll be at peace, man! I’ll be so happy! I’ll find my inner happiness, that inner silence, that inner calmness. Amazing, right? That is the power and beauty of Ilayaraja. don’t you think? He helps you to find your inner peace, that inner silence, that inner calmness. His songs themselves will have a lot of pause, silence and calmness and all that, inside the song itself. Have you observed that? Sometimes the pause will be a little too long. But hey, that’s where the beauty is, man. Who else but Maestro, made a song about silence? He did a song about silence; the song of silence! You know which one I’m talking about? (Hums the prelude of MOUNAMAANA by ILAYARAJA from SALANGAI OLI) This time of silence is golden! Ssss..Pause (Enjoys the pause in the song) This time of silence is golden! Why’d young heart feel the burden? Chiming tunes in the heart! But, the lips are so quiet? Chiming tunes in the heart! But the lips are so quiet? The reasons, who will find? (Enacts the flute music in the song) This time of silence is golden! Why’d young heart feel the burden? Such a beauty, right? Such a beautiful song, don’t you think? Such beauties don’t come anymore ya! Such beauties don’t come anymore. Even this beautiful song, we can’t listen like this anymore. When they play this on the FM radio here, The moment this song comes on the FM radio, If I’m driving, I’ll slow down. In fact I’ll pullover. I’ll stop the vehicle. I’ll want to listen to the full song, then proceed. But on the FM radio, they speed up the song ya… The songs gets faster at least twenty to thirty percent. And they’ve removed all the silence, pause, everything! For whatever reason. The song will sound like this. This time of silence is golden! (plays the song faster) Why’d young heart feel the burden? (plays the song faster) Sounds. Silence. Reasons Dei. Dei. Dei. What are you even doing ?!?! What is happening? The song hasn’t even started yet. That’s all. Over already. What is the hurry now? There’s so much hurry while announcing the song itself. (rolls fast) Next song is by Ilayaraja from Salangai Oli movie..blah blah What is your problem, dude? Why do you need such loud, fast beats while you are talking? Are you speaking while you’re on a treadmill? Life has gotten faster. We don’t have time for the slow paced songs anymore. And VIDYASAGAR made wonderful, amazing, masterpieces like that. Don’t you think? Vidyasagar fans! Go for it, yeah! Of course, man… Amazing beautiful songs. One of those masterpieces is this one. O’Floret! What an awesome piece! There’s a 4 beat gap between the first word and the next. Nobody has patience for that. Nobody has patience. I sang this on stage once, ok? I started the song. O’Floret! People thought I got stuck. From one side my friends are prompting me. Dude! Why so silent? Why so silent? I know, dudes! I am waiting for the right beat. You be silent! Why so silent? Now, Oh this silence! Oh this Silence! Oh, this Silence! Sageness! Swiftness Please! Sageness! is sageness! After that, I didn’t have a choice. The moment I paused, everybody is trying to fill in from all over. So I had to do fill-in-the-blanks myself. I was like, O Flowers…. Do you have a voice? If you do, you won't ever pause! I had to sing the background music and all. O’Floret! (sings the strings arrangement in the song) Why so silent? (strings) We need to bring that silence back into our lives, don’t you think? To enjoy life, to experience Wonderland. And another amazing aspect, we should celebrate in Maestro’s music, Of course, every aspect of Maestro’s music is celebrate-able! I mean, if there is a word like that. We should celebrate. This one, chorus section. Don’t you think? Every composition, every song will have this amazing chorus section. Even if you’re listening to that song for the 1000th time, When that portion comes, it will feel so fresh man. Have you experienced that? It will feel so fresh. It will feel like, something is coming from somewhere, It is just filling your heart, filled with joy, It is just lifting your soul somewhere. Have you experienced that? You listen carefully, The composition is just out of the world, Of course, It is Maestro! But, listen carefully. You can hear the chorus singers singing with a lot of frustration there. Their voice will clearly have anger and frustration to it! That is because, they all joined Ilayaraja’s chorus team, 40-50 years ago! During Annakili (70’s tamil movie) times they joined. From Annakili to presently, if you’ve been singing only chorus, won’t you be frustrated? Because, times have now changed. They are humans at the end of the day. And times have now changed? Rahman is ruling the industry for the past 25 years! Yeah! Applause for RAHMAN? Yeah, go for it, yeah! Times have changed. You join Rahman’s chorus team. One fine day, you will get a break. Out of nowhere he’ll tell you- I think I like your voice for this song Yeah, you in the back. I just heard you. Yeah. I just heard your voice. Let’s try it out for this song. You’ve been here for 5 years, eh? I’m so sorry. I’ve been engrossed with work. Let’s try it out. Out of nowhere, you get a break like that. You get a song. Not even one song, One humming in one song. Oh ye, oh ye, oh! That’s all you’ve to sing. He will still put your name in the CD label. Everybody will know who you are. He will do that. And he will take you on a world tour. Just to sing that one part Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh! Good job, you are done for the day, thank you! And when you come back from your first world tour, Even if you don’t get to sing another song, You can become Airtel Super Singer judge or something, Your life is set ya! Your life is set! Life is set! Your life is set! That is the power of A R Rahman! But, with Maestro, you join as a chorus singer, That’s it man! You remember PUTHU PUTHU ARTHANGAL (80’s Tamil movie) opening song? You remember? (Hums the prelude of KALYANA MAALAI by ILAYARAJA) The camera will just move all over the recording theatre. Finally, it will stop near the glass door. You remember? Behind the glass door… Bunch of young girls were standing and singing chorus, you recall? They are still there, man! Still there. That frustration is understandable? They are humans at the end of the day? Unfortunately, that comes out so obviously in so many songs. For example, this masterpiece sung by Mano. At the hill-top temple’s door Karthigai (spring month of Tamil calendar) lamp twinkles in there! The place is so lit and bright! The song of joy so fills the night! Now chorus… (sings the chorus section) Cut. Cut. Cut. Cut. Cut. Maestro is like, what is happening in the chorus booth? I gave you the music sheet at 9‘O clock this morning, The notes are correct! There is no life, no feelings to it. Why are you guys biting and spitting the notes? This is a romantic melody song. I want some life to it. Some feelings. What sir, life, feelings? Our state is so sad, Sir. Today marks 25 years of me joining the chorus team, Sir. I came to Madras with dreams of becoming a singer, Sir. Madras has become Chennai. I have not become anything, Sir! Give me one chance, Sir. Please give me on song, I’ll sing it with all feelings and prove it, Sir. Come on! How can you feel bad for these things? Everything will be ok overtime. First, sing this properly, c’mon! Sing properly, c’mon! One, two, three, four. (Chorus singing happens) Hmm, alright. it is okay! Add a slight reverb, boy. Take ok. You can go for lunch. That has happened to so many songs, man. And this one sung by the one and only SPB! The budding stem is dancing! Aaah. (Chorus) They are almost mocking the song. SPB is in the zone, he is trying to melt you down. The flowers are adorning! What to do, bud? We are humans at the end of the day, that is what it means. I think that is all it means. And, another amazing song man. I will never forgive anyone for messing up this song. Sung by MALAYSIA VASUDEVAN. How many of you like Malaysia Vasudevan? You are my people, dears! During the 90s, the golden period of Maestro, Of course, every other song was sung by SPB and Yesudas only. But, I have always been a big admirer of Malaysia Vasudevan. The feelings. The emotion. The tone he will bring in, every song will feel, You can’t even describe it. It will feel so real. So natural. So organic. I don’t know how to call it. Something is very pure about it. But, isn’t it so sad? Isn’t it so sad, we never celebrated Malaysia Vasudevan enough during his lifetime? It’s been 10 years since he’s gone. He was always under appreciated, man. Always under appreciated. Under celebrated. For what he did for all of us. For what he did for Tamil film music. Of course, he was overshadowed by this two big legends, SPB and Yesudas. Yeah? Happens. People even called him poor man’s SPB. Later on the title went to Mano, but it started there. People write things like one.t. I’ve read things like that. Malaysia Vasudevan has become exactly like Malaysia. When Singapore is expensive, you go to Malaysia. When producers don’t have enough funds for BALU sir, they recommend Malaysia. Damn! But the beauty is, We are all so blessed, somehow. The beauty is, in Tamil alone, Malaysia Vasudevan has sung 8000 songs, man. 8000 beautiful songs, he’s sung for us! He has sung 8000 beautiful songs. Still people call him, unsung hero. What do you mean unsung? He has sung dude! 8000 songs! What will he do if we call him “unsung” even after singing 8000 songs! I think that sadness would have definitely gotten to him. I think that has definitely gotten to him. He would have felt bad. I give so much of my soul in every song. After each recording, Ilayaraja seems to appreciate me so much. Why don’t people celebrate my songs as much as they celebrate the other ones? That sadness, you can feel in his voice man. You can feel in his voice. This masterpiece, in MUDHAL MARIYADHAI (80’s Tamil movie) O Breeze! Will you ever return? Will my song be of your delight? All you young folks are wondering, Who is this Malaysia, what is it? Malaysia WASudevan (Vasudevan)! old times. No, no, no. He’s evergreen. He will live forever. Those who don’t know Malaysia Vasudevan, Yes, applause for Malaysia Vasudevan, Yes, go for it, don’t hold back, go for it, yeah! Those who don’t know Malaysia Vasudevan, Go to YouTube tonight, Before you do anything else with YouTube, do this. Search for Mudhal Mariyathai. Mudhal Mariyathai means First Respect. Don’t search for First Respect, I said so that you’ll remember. Mudhal Mariyathai. He has sung ALL the 5 beautiful songs in that movie You listen to those songs once, You will pay your first respect right there to him. I bet my life. You’ll become his fan forever, man. Yeah. And that has a beautiful story. Apparently, Maestro called Malaysia Vasudevan at 5:30 in the morning for the recording, for that movie. Vasu! This is Raja speaking! (Yawning) Tell me Raja sir! This, Bharathi Raja’s movie! I have finished two songs! Can you come and sing? What happened? Isn’t Balu in town? What Vasu? Do you also talk like this? Yeah, he is not in town! Sorry, I woke you up too early in the day. We have to record a song by eleven and send it for shoot. When can you come? I’ve already boarded the autorickshaw, Raja! I’m on the way. I’ll come, bathe and dress up there. Yes there is sadness every time Malaysia sings. But, this song is an exception. This song. Everytime I listen to this one, I jump in joy… O’Flower! Tender Flower! You are boon giving! Beautiful spring! Sweet honey my lap is holding! O’ you sweety! you are forever mine! Oh sweet honey… you are forever mine! Chorus. Lalala… Lalalala… Lalalalala… Malaysia is like… Why? Really, why? Do I come over here that often? Once in a blue moon, I come to sing. Do I keep coming often? I rarely get a song. If you finish off things in Chorus like this, How will people listen? Vasu, you get at least get your solo once in a while. We’ve been sitting in the chorus booth for 27 years now. La la la Start. Even after this, Malaysia Vasudevan will start the song so happily. Hair grew long to form the waves Becoming the strands of the nights That is Malaysia vasudevan everybody. That is Malaysia Vasudevan. Amazing. We all have to take Malaysia Vasudevan as a big inspiration, man Because very often, you’ll be under appreciated, under celebrated in what you are doing, where you are working. You’ll be very often over shadowed by other big people in where you are. Sometimes, people will call you only if someone else is not there. I’m telling you, don’t take it to your heart. Don’t even think about it. Don’t take it to your heart. The only thing to remember, if you ask me, The most important thing to remember is, When you get that call, when you get the opportunity, get on that autorickshaw immediately! Get on immediately! Yes. You can bathe and dress up once you get there. Then, overtime, you will have your body of work. God is there. Life will happen. I’m telling you, you’ll be a hero, man. You will be a hero. Little bit unsung, but hey! At least one comedian will talk about you at some point. There is a chance for that. But the real unsung hero in Tamil film music if you ask me, is, Kamal Hasan. Kamal Hasan. Kamal as a singer I’m talking about. You don’t think of him as a singer at all. Yes, that way he’s unsung. And he is universal hero means always a hero for us? Bring that together - unsung hero! Did I not tell you? And Kamal has done some amazing songs. Amazing songs, man. O Minds, you lovely birds! Your pretty wing is stretching out For being with your consort, you are flying out Oh. My. God. Kamal will emote so beautifully, So soulfully, so deeply, you can feel a tinge of melancholy there. There is this soft melancholy in his voice. Said so, Kamal himself. My voice, when I sing, when I sing, there is soft melancholy in it, I’m sure. You know ‘A tinge of melancholy is an integral part of postmodern art forms’ is what they say in English! When I was in the United States of America, Los Angeles, we were doing this postmodern workshop for musical performing arts… What are you even saying, Sir? What are you even trying to say? This is a romance song only, no? This is a romance song. Your song. Your movie. In the picturization… You’re going to freak out and have all the fun! Eh? Why all this melancholy drama while singing? Why do you even have melancholy induced? Every single movie, don’t you have two? Minimum. Minimum, Sir. Minimum two heroines. With all of them, With all of them, you kiss it out so deep with them, so much so the Hollywood feels like nothing. Like how you eat ice cream, you kiss them so nice, so deep. With all that going nicely, why all the melancholy in singing, Sir? Sing joyfully, Sir. The song will be an even bigger hit! But, the universal hero cannot sing without that melancholy! If this is the case of a happy song, imagine the plight of a sad song. He will squeeze the juice out of it! In the farmland filled with Punnai (native tree of Tamil) A Cuckoo had the sound of deep cry That is when your agony hit me so very high! Ilayaraja is like, cut cut cut. Kamal, this is a sad song, yes. But, not so very much. Why are you even crying so much now? Huh? What happened? Election just got over. The result isn’t even out yet. Huh, what? Things have just started. Things haven’t even gotten to the centre of it yet. Devar Magan story still has so much more coming. Just hold back. Devar Magan story needs so much more variations to cover. Sivaji will die shortly, how will you emote for that? Huh? Just tone it down Kamal. Tone it down. No no no no… Even half is too much. Just tone it down completely. You know, Kamal could have become a legendary singer like SPB and Yesudas. He’s still a good singer. Don’t get me wrong. He’s still a good singer. But, the legend state like SPB and Yesudas is something else, right? That’s what I’m referring to. He had the potential for being a legend. But all that did not happen because of this one accident in Kamal’s career. This one accident called, Nayagan. Nayagan movie. After that Kamal’s everything changed. Kamal’s approach towards acting, singing, everything changed. The whole Kamal’s career can be split into two parts. Before Nayagan. Post Nayagan. Thank you. B.N. P.N. And that also, this one scene in Nayagan that changed everything. That one iconic scene everyone keeps talking about all the time. That one. (Mimics Kamal crying in Nayagan) Noone in this world cries like that. Right? What I mean is, it was so unique, that is what I’m saying. It was so unique. It got everybody’s attention. Each one of us would have thought about, talked about it, at least once. Even from Hollywood people called apparently. That Marlon Brando and all called. Oh, is this how a Don needs to cry? If you had hinted me a bit, I would have tried this in ‘The Godfather’ guys. Damn… Why didn’t you…? That crying act got so much attention, everybody talked about it. That crying act got so much attention, I think Kamal got stuck in that format. Of course, being an intellectual, he reverse engineered. He analyzed everything. He found out, you know… I have done so much body of work, everybody is talking about this one movie and one scene! What is happening in that? Kamal got that. All this while it was just a tinge of melancholy in my voice. Now there’s anger mixing to it. Melancholy on one side, anger on the other side That leads to this intense format! Our universal hero completely settled for that format. Even in acting, it’s the same case… Sir, simple scene today. It is a shoulder shot. The camera is behind. You just have to walk to the front. There’s an auto coming. You need to stop it. AUTO! The whole set vibrates. Sir, I’m the one driving. Why are you shaking, Sir? Got too scared, Sir. And singing also got that intensity man. O Master of Raghu clan! Our KING RAM! The absolver of our sin! Dear SEETA’s RAM! WHOAAA… Ilayaraja is like, Kamal! This need not be this high, dear! Why don’t we bring down by two notes and make it comfortable? (Kamal tries to speak with the Post Nayagan tone) What are you trying to say now? Well, Raja Sir, just… Just give me one more, you know. I want to hit that high note. They say the intense hitting of the high note in the postmodern art forms… Oh God, you sing sing.. Why do you have to complicate everything? You sing, you sing. Simply complicating things. Even a simple song, Kamal can walk into the studio, Just knock it off in a few minutes. That intensity will be brought in. Blue………….. sky! You………….. You grab some tea and come DSP! Let me figure a few things out! But the good thing is There is always a good thing in everything man. The good thing is, if you ever have… Constipation issue, you play one Post Nayagan song, solved. I mean, you’ve to play and sing along. Simply don’t play the song alone and come to me… What man Alex? I played the full song, my constipation is still not cleared? Ey! Play the song and sing along with the same intensity… By the time the song is over… It will be cleared. Confirmed. It will be clear. For example this one: My Love ain’t Cauvery (South Indian river) To Block off from flowing I am longing! Now is the time for the love song to rhyme and chime! Come O Come! (Constipated sound) Still not come guys! The world hasn’t seen such Honeymoon Come join. Let’s croon as one! Come O Come! Fear, you let go! (Feeling relieved) Fear, you let go! Fear, you let go! Let us rise, repel, revolt! Oh, this Masterminded bathroom plan is OK, my dear! The universal hero Kamal Haasan, everybody. The universal hero Kamal Haasan! What a legend! Sorry, I didn’t mean to equate Kamal with constipation Err.. complication. Complication. Complication times are gone, man. After Mayyam (Kamal’s political party), have you been observing? Kamal is keeping things simple. Gone are those days where, for two lines of Twitter, he will go all over. Those things are gone. Don’t you think? He’s keeping things simple, man. I wish him good luck on the political career! Round of applause for Kamal Haasan. Let’s do that. He’s keeping things simple. I think Ulaga Nayagan got it man. Beauty lies in simplicity. That’s what I firmly believe. Beauty lies in simplicity, I think man. Think about this simple instrument. You know the name of the instrument? It is called the Double Bongos, right? One of the simplest percussion rhythm instruments. And you can buy this for 700 bucks in Chennai even today. And will you believe if I say, this simple instrument, ruled Tamil Film Music, for half a century, man? I’m not exaggerating. For 50 years, every other super hit song that came in Tamil film music, had only this instrument as the core rhythm instrument. This sound, I’m sure you can all recall. (plays the opening rhythm of Paartha Nyabagam song) This sound ruled Tamil film music for half a century. This music director, we all adore, he will live forever. He’s living forever. He made amazing, wonderful, soulful songs. The melodies will be out of the world. The percussion: just bongos and nothing else. Of course, I’m talking about, the King of Melodies, M S VISWANATHAN! M S Viswanathan! People even teased him. What Sir, for 50 years, you lazed around with just the bongos. I think MSV wants to tell us one thing very clearly. Beauty lies in simplicity man. Wonderland lies in simplicity. Even on Bongos, he wouldn’t complicate. He would not go into the complex rhythm patterns and all. Just the 4-beat rhythm for every song, ya. This 4 beat… One, two, there, four, that’s all. Whatever maybe the situation, Whatever maybe the emotion, that he has to show, Anything that ever happens in any story, For anybody’s life, MSV has captured anything and everything in this 4-beat rhythm. One, two, three, four. I went to get some fresh air A poem fell into my hand! She snatched it away from me Now, where did you go away baby? I just went to get some fresh air A poem fell into my hand! So romance is building up. He goes to the girl with the poem and proposes. She reads it. Here it goes! O O Walk slowly, walk slowly. Don’t hurt your tender body! Your jasmine feet will hurt and become achy! Won’t it disturb your decked up beauty? Ahaaaa…. Ririiii rariiiii…. Tharararira…. O O Walk slowly, walk slowly. Don’t hurt your tender body! So the romance is working out slowly, they are starting to meet very often. They are going on a date night followed by pubbing and dancing.. There she goes! What a pretty face! Here he comes! He is so nice! It’s getting dark! It’s time for the moon! Next is wedding knot! Such a sweet bond! What else do we want? This is going to go for ever and ever! So everything worked out ok, they get married. First night. First night is happening. Milk and fruits have made it to your hands Smile with those pearl like lips… Walking like this pretty pleasant peahen! May you be in blissful serene! Then life takes a turn. That is what is life right? Sometimes it will take a turn, it is not pleasant, breakup happens. She goes away. She walks away from the relationship. What to do right? You’ve to move on. Life goes on. And when life goes on, beat goes on too. There she went flying! Leaving me behind! She snatched and walked away my two eyes, making me so blind! Sometimes life will take a very harsh turn. You wouldn’t even be ready for it, but it’ll happen. You’ve to take it right? What to do? That is life. Death happens. She passes away. Can you believe it? She passes away. What to do? Death is part of life. Inevitable. We’ve to face it. Because the show must go on right? When the show goes on, the beat goes on too. O O O! Gone is gone, you let it go! Noone’s around forever, you gotta let them go! Gone is gone, you let it go! But this is Tamil Cinema guys! She will come back as a ghost! Yesss! The girl is back. Yes baby, the babe is back, the same girl, so same beat continues. Don’t you remember seeing me? The drama of tender age is what I blame! Together we had such a passing time! Will my heart pass over this lovely hymn! Don’t you remember seeing me? The drama of tender age is what I blame! MSV everybody! MSV! MSV will live forever. Don’t you think? MSV will live forever ya. It has been only four years since he left us. Till the end he had that love for music. Even the last interview he gave to the media… was 2 weeks before his demise. was filled with his love for music. Love for life and, Humility… You'll always see that. Humility… And above all that, if you ask me, that, MSV energy. That buzzing energy was there till the end, man. Such an inspiring legend. Right? Such an inspiring legend. Till the end the energy was fully there. Sir, in this legendary career of yours, what do you consider as your first turning point? If you ask me… the first turning point, not just for me, even for the King of Poets Kannadasan also This is the song that showed us the way. New Bird (Puthiya Paravai) is the film that showed us to the world. We all started flying higher after the New Bird film. Especially this song. O O Walk slowly, walk slowly. Don’t hurt your tender body! She will be ok. You don’t please hurt yourself, sir! Your jasmine feet will hurt and become achy! No sir. She will be fine. You relax, no, sir! Your waist is dancing away to glory! Won’t it disturb your decked up beauty? Ahaaaa…. Ririiii rariiiii…. Tharararira…Doi Doi Doi doi… doi doi… doi doi…. All right? That Doi doi will be there in every MSV song. It is not dei dei, it is always dei doi only. Oh son in law doi! King of this land doi! Even when he had to act, he had to say that. We are all Dei Doi family! Sir, you’ve given us all super hits with the legendary director K Balachandar, please tell us about that? I can never forget the experience with KB sir. We’ve done multiple songs with King of Poets Kannadasan. So many good songs, so many good movies, have done it all. Especially, I can never forget, Aval Oru Thodar Kathai (She, the endless story) That one situation in the movie where the hero lands up in the street I’ve composed more than thirty tunes for that one situation. I almost landed on the street myself that day Thirty tunes for one song! Composing was planned for 8:30 in the morning. And I got there by 8 because the king of poets Kannadasan is coming! KB Sir came. We then got a call from the poet’s place saying he’ll be late and he had asked us to start. KB asked me to start and I start to play one tune after the other! He kept saying, give me something else, give me something else! That in itself was an endless story! It was around 4:30 PM and we were at this tune, the king of poets walked in. Everything fell in place by God’s grace. tha ra ra ra ro.. Ra di da di doi! (sings the tune) I hadn’t even finished singing the line. The poet gave out the lines as he was walking in O you God-sent sweet home! Street is thy name! I added a flute piece in there. Toti Doi Doi Doi Doi Doi! After listening to that, even Balachandar cried right there! Right there! MSV is such a legend man. Such a gift for all of us. Of course, he didn’t compose for the past couple of decades. And if he had composed, in the last two decades… My bet is, he would have done it with the same simplicity, man. This (Harmonium) and this (Bongos) and nothing else. Yeah? I will bet my life on it. The magic would have worked, ya. The magic would have definitely worked. I bet man. The magic would have definitely worked. So this context, this song is a possibility. Sir, please tell us your experience about working with Dhanush? Oh that was a peculiar experience altogether. I was excited to work with the younger generation. One day, Dhanush and who was the other person? Ha! Anirudh! Dhanush and Anirudh, both walked into my office. They walked in like two pencils. Dhanush gave me the lyrics sheet and asked me Sir! You compose base tune. Anirudh can do the orchestration. We want to do this experiment. I was very happy that with God’s grace (MSV’s energetic mumbling) I was so happy to see the lyrics. Why this murderous murderous rage di? Bros, the meter is very nice. Only the matter needs some fixing. Meter is great. This is will sit in perfectly in my four beat pattern! No problem. Why murder rage and all that in the beginning of the song itself? Already there’s a lot of violence and shooting in the world. Murderous Rage won’t suit me. I’m a melody king no? Let’s replace it with artistic rage? We all believe that Art will heal the world, no? I asked if Art rage is ok and we immediately changed to it. And “di” is so disrespectful of women. Let’s change to Doi Let’s stick to Doi. That’s when we did this base tune. Why this art rage doi? Art rage doi? Art rage, art rage, art rage… From vocal, we roll into the flute! Art rage, art rage, art rage doi…. Toti Doi Doi Doi Doi Doi…. Ah ha, why this art rage, art rage, art rage, doi? Doi Doi Doi Doi… Ah ha, why this art rage, art rage, art rage, doi? Doi doi doi doi… Doi doi doi doi… doi doi doi…. Ah ha, why this art rage, art rage, art rage, doi? Doi doi doi oi… doi doi… And the melody raises up and up from there! MSV will live forever man. MSV will live forever. When we talk about the good old times,the MSV times! Let’s celebrate this singer from that era. SIRKAZHI GOVINDARAJAN Such a God sent singer. We are talking about 1940s, 50s and early 60s. Microphone technology was just coming into South India. So, many singers had to do this open throat singing. If you go for a musical concert then, people will be sitting all over the ground But, there are no mics. No technology, nothing. You have to reach until the last row. So, many singers had this open throat singing then. High volume, High energy.. You have to throw the high energy and everything. Like KB Sundarambal, Madurai Somu, TR Mahalingam. That sort of amazing singers. In that line up, I believe Sirkazhi Govindarajan was top in the chart. Yeah Amazing. High Volume, High Energy, High Pitch. High pitch in the sense - tearing everything into pieces! Listening to Sirkazhi’s songs, I will try finding the notes in my harmonium, those notes are not even here. They all come after the harmonium. High energy, high volume, high everything. When I was in my village, we all will be sleeping in the night. At early morning, around 4:30 Sirkazhi will come online in the tube like loudspeakers at the Goddess temple. O Lord Ganesha, absolver of our sins! Everybody will wake up. One alarm clock for the entire village. O Lord Ganesha, liberate us from desires! We are up now, sir. Thank you. Sleep runs when Sirkazhi comes! Because, he cannot tone down or soften down his voice and all. The most tone down song, he has ever sung is Jasmine flower has blossomed full Guardian man is watching out well Just for a Jasmine’s blossom, are you hitting this hard? Jasmine has softly blossomed. That’s all, no sir! If you look at his collection, you go to soft romantic melody section, it is almost empty. The only soft romantic melody number he has ever done is There is no time for romance No one’s even giving me a glance Obviously, Sir. What do you expect? The age is here to love and elope! My horoscope doesn’t have any scope! It’s not the horoscope problem sir! Your volume problem. Hasn’t anyone told you this yet? Earlier it was all live recording, right? The hero will be the singer also. And singers will be the heroes. Sound had also been recorded live only. Within one line of singing, the heroine would have come, told Sirkazhi, Let us not meet here after, dear Gopal! Why, dear? When you came near me and sang the first line of the song, I lost hearing in one ear, dear Gopal! I lost hearing in one ear. You know me very well. Don’t you? You know, I have only two ears! Let me go somewhere and live off with my other ear Please let me go, pal, dear Gopal! That would have definitely happened. With that monumental voice, Sirkazhi has done a lot of national integration songs. National Integration Songs!? That makes sense. When he sings, the whole country can listen. O horn! Blow hard! Sirkazhi has played a strong role in ending the British rule! British colonialists would have definitely said, Man, these are all loud buggars. Let’s get out of here Let’s get out of here” They would have told the queen Her Majesty! we can’t manage, Madam. We are coming back, Madam. He is shouting every morning, Madam. Couldn’t sleep, Madam. What can we do with this Holy Morning Hour (4:30 AM), Madam? No idea where he shouts from, Madam! He can shout from anywhere and everywhere, Madam. Let’s get out of here, buddy! said the Britishers and gave independence. Otherwise, if you look at Sirkazhi’s collections, it is filled with devotional numbers. The number of devotional numbers he has done is so many, if you do the math, during his lifetime, everyday he should have sung at least one song. I think during his career, everyday, he would have woken up, gone to the studio, To which God am I singing today, pal? Oh Lord Ganesha? Okay. Everyday he would have sung at least one song. Only then, he can cover so many. And he is THE right guy to sing to God, no? With THAT voice, there is a good chance, he can reach God also, man. Amazing. Thirupathi hill resident, O VENKATESA! It will definitely reach Thirupathi! Confirmed! AT THE SHORES OF THIRUCHENDUR SEA MY LORD SENTHIL’s REALM, YOU SEE! THOSE WHO SEEK HIS BLESSINGS DAILY FEEL HIS GRACE ABUNDANTLY! AT THE SHORES OF THIRUCHENDUR SEA MY LORD SENTHIL’s REALM, YOU SEE! Even Lord Muruga will find his swag only through this song! Oh my God, this is my kingdom, right? Where is it? Dear Sirkazhi Uncle, I loved listening to your song. Please proceed up! He is already up so high, dude! Sirkazhi’s voice is called as ‘Bronze Voice’. Because you can find the bell sound in there. The mighty sound of Lord’s church bell! In this song, Sirkazhi sings in one end, Bell will be ringing from the other end. We can’t segregate Sirkazhi’s voice and the ringing bell. It’s a complete merge. Complete merge! Because the Sirkazhi’s voice has that vibrato! That shivering. I think, the highest of vibrato in the history of mankind is Sirkazhi Govindarajan. Every line will ring like a bell. O Almighty! My only deity! If you are doing Pooja/Aarathi and all, you don’t need a bell. For whatever God it is, he would have sung at least one song. You play that song, bell is also covered. Since you are dwelling My heart is swelling! O MURUGA! O Almighty! My only deity! MURUGA! He will ring bell in all the ranges! Such a God sent singer, man. Then this epic song happened. One Epic Song.. An epic song and all, has to happen. You can’t make it. I think, once in a while, God decides, OK. It’s been a while,you guys take one song and enjoy for sometime. Such an epic song was given to Sirkazhi, man. Not just for Sirkazhi, for Tamil film music itself, if there are a few epic songs, this surely is one of them! Even after our times, when they talk about the history of Tamil film music, I don’t think anybody can ever, anybody will ever miss this one song. Composed by MSV. Sang by Sirkazhi. Appeared in KARNAN. Ullathil Nalla Ullam.. For the first time, even the situation was epic. Everything was epic about the song, folks. For the first time, even the situation was different. Everyday Sirkazhi will wake up, go to the studio, sing to one God. And the lyrics is always the same: God save all of us. We humans are hopeless. He would have represented all of us. He has been praying for all of us. God! Please, at least for today, put on us just the corner of your eyes and make this day a little better. He was doing that. That day he went to the work. That day he went to work. He asked which God, they said, You yourself is the God today, Sir! For the first time, even the situation was the other way around! Lord Krishna has come down. God has come down, he is going to sing to one human called Karnan. And God is going to be begging for forgiveness to a human. Karna, you are a good soul. I did all the mistakes? You forgive me. Will you forgive me? God is asking for forgiveness to a human being. Such an epic situation. So, God Krishna has to come down and sing to a human being. Which means we need a voice representing the whole universe. Doesn’t it? Without even thinking for a second, they would have said, Of course, Sirkazhi only, man. Everything is epic man. And who is Krishna? Somebody has to come from out of the world, right? So all the way from Andhra, NT Rama Rao. And you look at the art work in that song. Even for our times, it is amazing. Despite all these epic things happening in the scene, you know who will score in the scene! KARNAN! Yes! Because, who is Karnan? Our man only. SIVAJI. The briefing given to Sivaji would have been very simple! Sir, we are in the battlefield and this is the last scene of the movie! You have already removed your armour! Arjunan shoots the arrows at you. Then, there is this huge fall. You are falling down from the chariot. You are on the ground. And now Lord Krishna arrives. Krishna arrives at the battleground. MSV has composed an outstanding melody, Sir. It has come out so well in Sirkazhi’s voice. Lord Krishna is walking through the battleground singing the song. We are covering the entire artwork. By the end of the song, he will come and stand near you. There we end the story. But how can Sivaji not act for one whole song? How is that even possible? See how the star of stars had found a way to get in and act. Not just act. Epic acting and epic scoring. See how he has done that. Hey, dear director! Please come here for a minute. I am here. Yes me only. Look back. It won’t be nice to be on the ground through the song, doing nothing What I can do is this. Bearing the pair of arrows, the wounds and all the distress, I will gently walk around the battleground. I will walk down. You keep the cameras in the low angle. Take all the close ups and everything. I am walking down. Ask that Krishna to follow me. Once he finishes the song, let me get ready with one huge act. I will make a big twist and turn and fall down with a huge crash and we will end. That will work better, I think. What do you think? Oh, No Sir! That may not be possible, Sir! You had removed the armour and you are shot by arrows! You are now on the ground. In another two minutes, the whole story is going to end It may not be wise to get up and walk around now. With such deep distress, the character will not be able to walk for sure, Sir. Oh.. I can’t walk? Fine then Then this. Once Krishna finishes the song Let me have a word with him. You already had plenty of words, no, Sir? In the sense, page after page, it is all your dialogs in Karnan. Now if we close soon after the song, it will be good. In another ten seconds, it is all going to be over, Sir! It won’t be wise to keep talking at this juncture. With all the wounds and pain, it can’t happen, Sir! Damn..I can’t even speak? Can I at least breathe? Or you want to skip that also? Just breathing, brother! Do you have to ask this, Sir! Of course, breathing is on, Sir! I told you already no, Sir? Breathing is on But, we need to end the breathing once the song ends. Alright. I can breathe, right? Now I will figure my way. Go for the take. I will see him there. Oh, in this epic song of Tamil film music the star of stars has done some epic acting, just with breathing. Because that was the only thing that was possible. He was not even allowed to open his eyes to show any expression. Only breathing. See, the arrows are here, right, pointing here. Sivaji is doing that deep abdominal Pranayama (yogic) breathing Kapala Bhathi (skull cleanser) breathing He is doing that so intense and deep, the arrows will just move all over the screen. NT Rama Rao walking around, amazing art work in the background, MSV’s outstanding melody, Sirkazhi’s booming voice.. Nothing will grab your attention, because Sivaji is sitting in the foreground breathing. You can’t take your eyes off him, because he is sitting there in the foreground, telling you, “Look at me, baby” That’s when this epic song of Tamil film music rolls on the screen, man. Heart! O this is noble good heart! You will never cease to exist That’s the rule of God of all might! KARNA! Now, face up to this forthcoming feat! (Pathos music playing) They have blown the horn of ending also. But that is for Karnan. Sivaji is not giving up. Between the reprise and the stanza, the interlude is there, right? Sivaji has pushed his way in: Hey Director, wait a minute. I am ok not to have my dialogues in between, as myself has told you before. But in between the song, Let me make some sounds of sorrow. Oh, that will be ok, Sir. We can always add sounds in between. Between Pallavi and Saranam, on top of the interlude, even in the original song track itself, Sivaji has pushed his way in. His voice is there. (Sounds of suffering by Sivaji) Sivaji’s mind voice. Dear brother Sirkazhi, Can’t you just lower your voice a bit? Me your elder brother is in deep distress with these deathly arrows, you are simply screaming around. Don’t you see that I am trying to breathe in here? Please reduce your volume. Can you go out and sing? Can you go out and sing? Reduce the volume. That’s when promptly Sirkazhi responds: Not were you born to your mother Hence not even a brother Not were you born to your mother Hence not even a brother Now, will you let me hold that labor? KARNA! Now, face up to this forthcoming feat! (Horn of end plays again) The second horn is blown now. But Sivaji is not giving up. (Sound of sorrow by Sivaji) Hey Sirkazhi, bloody rascal! I have been crying for help. You didn’t stop singing even a bit. Listen! To get rid of my old baggage of actions, I myself dismantled my armour and accepted these arrows on me! Even now, it is not over! Even if God does not will, Toil with your heart and soul, There will happen your will said the great great grandfather of this soil, poet THIRUVALLUVAR. I still believe, through this Kapalabhati breathing, I can eventually push these arrows out of my body. I am not asking for your assistance. But will you please not be a hindrance? It looks like, you won’t ever stop singing. You won’t even reduce your volume a bit. Well, I know you are not capable of (reducing the volume). I just have this one request, my dear! Please please don’t go into the high pitch! Your low itself hitting into the highs. If the pitch gets high, I know even glasses will break, my little science knowledge says. My heart already has cracked into two, Now, don’t break it into pieces! I plead you. Please don’t get into the high range! That's when Sirkazhi promptly responds You had to repay them So, landed in the wrong team Trapped by the insidious scheme KARNA! Lord Krishna is the one to blame! KARNA! Now, face up to this forthcoming feat! (Horn of end blows again) Only then finally Sivaji gives up. Such an inspiring lesson, the star of stars is teaching us. He is telling us one thing very clearly. Because in our lives, we all have dreams. We all want to achieve so many things. But very often, we are so filled with limitations. You can’t go there. You can’t do this. You can’t even touch it. You can’t even think about this. You are filled with limitations. At that time, think about Sivaji, man. The star of stars is telling us one thing very clearly. If you can breathe, you can do it. Period. That was legend SIRKAZHI GOVINDARAJAN. Let’s talk about legend of our times. Yeah. Yes.. I think, we live in a unique time, man. I think even after our times, when they talk about legends in male singing, I think the top two will be from our times. Because of the number of songs they have done. The quality, the body of work, the unique work and all that. Legends of our times, SPB and Yesudas, Don’t you think? And how do you even start to describe these legends? One simple way to talk about SPB is, he is a variety singer. I mean, I am not saying he has sung a variety of songs. Every song will have all the variety you need. Incase, if you don’t listen to the next song, this song will have it all! One soft little melodic song will have this one Reba raba Riba baba... that, power element. One power packed song will have this soft little line of Aaahaan haan haan that thing. And he will cry in any song and any place. And he will invariably laugh in every song. That kind of variety we are talking about. One soft little melodic song, for example, O Breeze! You reached my courtyard! But, would you not enter my heart-yard? Beloved, My beloved! The situation is, a couple just got married. But the girl is saying that she wants to break up. So, it is a very sad little moment. SPB will go into the zone, he will melt you down. When Boopalam (morning melody) dawns Would blue sky refuse? Why would you not disclose? O Breeze! You reached my courtyard! But, would you not enter my heart-yard? Beloved, My beloved! From here, SPB will shift gears. He will go into the power mode. And he will find a genuine reason for it. Because I think, he goes into the mind of Mic Mohan, err Mouna Ragam Mohan. Mouna Ragam Mohan. You can feel his frustration, right? What, dear? You have not even stepped into the house after the wedding. Now, you are asking for a breakup? That agony, that pain, that insult needs all the power in the world, right? That’s why SPB gets into that zone. (Hums the high pitch interlude before the stanza) Droplet on a lotus, Wouldn’t find a place A boy and girl in dissonance Wouldn’t ever embrace! To carry on like friends, Seriously? You are friend zoning me? Post wedding? To be acquaintance, Why do we need the garlands and the wedding rituals? Without any relatives, avoiding all the loved ones, You have made me yell like a dog, in the middle of the street, you girl! Oh dear! What is you purpose? Yell...err...Tell Tell me. What did I do to you? Tell me. Sorry baby. I didn’t mean to shout. Let me keep it soft. O Breeze! You reached my courtyard! But, would you not enter my heart-yard? Beloved, I still love you baby, My beloved! That variety, only SPB has done. Don’t you think? And SPB has done the other way around too. In the middle of a power-packed song, he will drop in like a baby for a couple of lines. It will still work for whatever reason. Somehow, SPB will hold it. We are talking about a power packed song. We are talking about, Thalaivar introduction kind of power. SUPER STAR introduction needs all the power in the world. That’s why you will think, SPB has invariably sung pretty much all the Thalaivar intro songs. If you ask me, it is the other way around. SPB will pump in so much power, you can clearly see Thalaivar is struggling to match that power. That’s why every time SPB sings, Thalaivar will be like Ha ha ha. The song has come out so beautiful. Balu Sir has done a very good job. I am very happy. But I think, song has come out a little bit more powerful than required. Dancing is going to be difficult for this song! I will walk! Every time SPB sings, you can see Thalaivar is mostly walking around. Because through dance, one can’t match the power. Junior dancers will be lined up all over the ground. How many ever junior dancers all over the world, they will all be there. Lined up all over the ground. The trolleys will be there all over the ground. They will be doing some simple step. One. Two..One Two..One Two. It has been a while since action was called. Thalaivar is nowhere to be seen. What is happening, dude? Dude, it is quite a long line, right? Thalaivar must be on his way walking through. We need to wait. How long should one be doing this one boring step, dude? Hey, don’t complain, dude. See, the trolley is so near. Thalaivar will cross so close to us. When that happens, if you turn around and take a direct look at the camera, we get registered and our life will change forever. Oops! Thalaivar crossed, dude! I told you not to talk to me while working. Because Thalaivar will do the swift walk. Really fast. Hey, if you die, still body Dead fish is still handy Kannadasan said it correctly! Amazing, Sir! We covered it all. Powerful walk, Sir! What can we do for the next line, Sir? I will walk back. But a cow lives to give out milk, After life gives out skin I just found recently! Overtime, SPB has only made this more difficult. You watched Sivaji? Opening song. Ballelakka Ballelakka To Salem or Madurai Thalaivar tried walking. But the song itself clearly said, if you are going to walk for this song, you are going to walk all over Tamil Nadu To Salem or Madurai Madras or Tiruchi or to Thiruthani Hey, Ballelakka Ballelakka Thalaivar managed up to this point. Then came this killer line. Sadu Kudu Sadu Kudu Sadu Kudu Sadu K udu Sadu Kudu Sadu Kudu played under this tree Padu Padu Padu Padu grass filled green ground Thoda Thoda Thoda Thoda… Chuda Chuda Chuda Chuda… Staying in my heart always right right right right right right! Right! All Right! Apple juice! Re Re Re … O God. I am coming, guys! Hold on! Le Le Le La la la la Apple Juice! Remember some years ago, Thalaivar was in the hospital due to physical exhaustion That one only. For six months, the only treatment was just unwind. Nothing. Just unwind, Sir. Just unwind from all these SPB energy and all. That was the only treatment. That’s why it took time. And the first three months, he was here only in Porur, Ramachandra Hospital. The treatment didn’t work. Because suddenly somebody will play an SPB song somewhere. Thalaivar will get up and ask: Should I be walking now? No. No, Sir! Some wedding is going on nearby. It’s the loudspeaker that is playing Close the door. Thalaivar said ‘No. Too much of noise pollution here in Chennai’ Let’s go to Singapore! At Singapore, Thalaivar went to Mount Elizabeth Hospital. Thirtieth floor. No SPB song will reach the 30th floor of Mount Elizabeth hospital in Singapore. That was the only treatment. Thalaivar unwound from all that SPB energy and all. Tapped into that spiritual energy deep inside. Got that power. Came back. For that song, let’s go for dance only. Because doctors have asked me not to go for long walks. We will go with dance only but without movements. Like how we are in politics now, but not going for elections. Similarly! Keep it simple. Let there be dance but remove the movements alone. We too have planned the same way only, Sir. We can proceed in the same way, Sir. Just graceful, just aesthetics.. You can focus like that, Sir! Power song only, but, we can take care of it in camera work, Sir. Through camera work, technical work and angles, we can bring on that power, Sir. So, Thalaivar is doing all that graceful moves, like hanging the clothes for drying, bulb fixing and so on. All these cute adorable moves, Thalaivar is doing. Ballelakka Ballelaka.... Salem or Madurai Madras or Thiruchi Hanging clothes at one city after another! or to Thiruthani! While thalaivar is doing all these adorable and aesthetically beautiful moves, somebody has to bring in that power, right? The camera is doing all the work. Ballelakka Ballelaka.... To Salem or Madurai Madras or Thiruchi or to Thiruthani! Thiruthani! This and all is happening. The dance master was mainly working with the camera man only. Yes. One, Two, three, four, five, six, down, down Close, close, up, down and jump and drop. Can you do it? Yes, Sir. I can do this for sure. You have to do it holding the camera? Can you do it? Give me one more chance, Sir. I will pull it off, Sir! And, ‘Oruvan Oruvan Muthalaali’ in MUTHU Such a killer song for Thalaivar only. SPB is pumping in just outstanding energy there. You can clearly see thalaivar is pushing himself so hard. Because, he cannot walk, he cannot dance, because, thalaivar is sitting on a horse cart. How can you show power while sitting on a horse cart? You can see Thalaivar is pushing his limits. Man desires for the soil Soil desires for man in the meanwhile! Soil prevails overall! Man never comes to terms at all! Aah! Apple Juice, please. And SPB being the legend, he knows. OK. These two lines would have been so hard on Rajini to show power sitting on a horse cart. He drops in.. He figures out. OK. Let’s give him a breather for a couple of lines. Birds all look at me, happy and caring Asks me how well I am doing When the tender buds open for blossoming, ‘Muthu Muthu’ they come calling Thalaivar goes into the little naughty little mode. And SPB holds the song for him and it is still a power song. Such a variety singer SPB is. And SPB can laugh into any song. He can laugh in any place in any song. Especially in a sad song. I was thinking about you.. Aahaa Sir! Sir! They said it is a love-failure song, and you are laughing!? Hey man, leave it that way. Balu Sir’s laughter takes the song to the next level Sir, you did your laugh in the song on Sivaji’s demise, right in the middle of the stanza. Song itself took off from there only, Sir. He has reached the skies now with dignity and pride! People never got it, they still have divide! Suffering is still on the poor and deprived Sing the praise of great men! Aahnn...(chorus) Chorus Dear girls, Sivaji himself is dead now. Can’t you cooperate just for this one day? Such men walked on this land! So what? Even through the difficult times, SPB can just laugh. Sometimes, he will just be laughing. Instead of singing, he will generally be laughing. Because it is SPB, it will still feel so melodic. On your eyes! pretty beautiful eyes! You do speak in silence! Crores of lightning came together made these cutie pupils! Crores of lightning came together made this cutie pupil! Whenever SPB sings, that’s what always happens. There’s someone out there, tickling him somewhere. On you eyes! pretty beautiful eyes! She does speak in silence! SPB, the legend everybody. SPB the legend. SPB is a variety singer. Yesudas on the other hand, One variety for everything.. Whatever may be the situation, the feel of the song, the mood of the character, the story. That and all is your problem. He will go into the serious, the spiritual, the soothing, that musical, melodious, one kind of voice for everything. One kind of voice for everything still works. Because, he is one of a kind. All living things on earth say ‘O Mother’! Adoring motherhood would take you higher! Morning through the evening I am looking! I am praying to the Almighty for this one thing! My sweet and gold shining moon Memories are comforting.. All sorts of memories and dreams and thoughts burgeon in my heart! Raja Raja Cholan is me the King! You are the queen of love who is ruling! O dear! Love is an evil thing! Aiyappa! I surrender Aiyappa! Aiyappa! My God Aiyappa! And then this song, Month of Masi started and my girl came of age, now she’s mine One of the horniest songs ever written. In the super deluxe lingo, Gaaji to the max. Children are here. Let us not go deep into the details. By reading the lyrics itself, you will go sleepless for two weeks. But Yesudas has sung it with full devotion. Full, complete devotion. Especially when it comes to the stanza, it will sound like a song in praise of Goddess Kanchi Kamatchi. The art of desire is so strange The poem is filled with this love rage! We read and read through each and every page Om..Om..Om.. Imagine for a second, what would have happened if SPB had sung it. I don’t know whether it is a good thing or bad thing I don’t know whether it is fortunate or unfortunate, SPB had sung it in Telugu.. You know baby, nights are so regular, moon is rather so rare! Wow! You know, everything will happen in the song itself. And SPB will take you through the whole process. Step by step. Oh..oh..oh...Oho oho! And if you watch the picturization, which I highly highly recommend, not to watch. Because once you watch it, you can never ever unwatch it. Because in Telugu, there is one Mr. Bala Krishna He is not just Bala (Baby) Krishna rather Adult Krishna He is just going for it, man. You know baby, nights are so regular Oh my God! All these midnight masala, late-night heroine moves and all, he is doing.. The Girl is like shocked Master hasn’t given these steps at all. He is just doing on his own when we roll. Adult Krishna err Bala Krishna going like this and all. SPB has done an outstanding work. I want to do justice for this. That girl is like running away. I am telling you, we are all so lucky.. We are all so blessed, man. In Tamil, we are all so lucky. It’s all because of God’s grace and divine blessings that Yesudas has sung it for us. Because what is the point of all this lust and small pleasure. It is all Maya (Illusion), right? We all know, it’s all Maya. They say, the whole life itself is a maya. And we are all going through this big Maya, this big illusion, Our paths may be different. But, where are we headed after that? All of us. To divinity only!? To God only!? Yesudas will directly take us there, I am telling you. Directly take us there. He is God’s own singer from God’s own country, man. Absolutely man. Absolutely. That’s why, Yesudas and Gods are so inseparable. Especially Lord Aiyappa, you know. Everyday only after listening to Yesudas’ Harivarasanam, Lord Aiyappa at Sabarimala goes to sleep. Such a close association. Every Tamil month of Margazhi is Aiyappan season. And invariably every other year, in my village, we will have Yesudas Aiyappan concert. They will put up huge posters with Yesudas’ image in it saying Yesudas Aiyappan Concert. Yesudas himself won’t come to my place to perform. From a nearby town, one troupe will come. In that, one guy will sing almost like Yesudas. They will sing exclusively Yesudas songs that year. That is called Yesudas Aiyappan concert. First few hours, they will sing, Yesudas Aiyappan songs from the cassettes. At some point, they will run out of songs. But, in villages, only if you sing till early morning, they will pay you. They will clearly tell you, You need to perform until the Sirkazhi’s song plays in the temple early in the morning These guys after a few hours, they will run out of songs. Do you know what they do? They will take any and every Yesudas’ film song, just make some small changes. “Swamy Saranam Aiyappa”, that’s all. You put these there, the format and the feel will match so perfectly. No other film songs will work that way. Only Yesudas. Because the divine vibration is already set by Yesudas. It is already there. you just have to fix the lyrics. You will feel like, Oh this feels much better. This feels correct. And this is one of the songs that I heard when I was very young. See me Lord, my God O thee Aiyappa, I surrender unto thy feet See me Lord, my God O thee Aiyappa, I surrender unto thy feet We climbed all steps excited that we made it Two knots on head, we hold till seeing thy feet! See me Lord, my God O thee Aiyappa, I surrender unto thy feet We surrender to Aiyappa God Chorus happening. We surrender to Aiyappa God Sabari foothills we reached first. Pamba river quench our thirst Sabari foothills we reached first Pamba river quenched our thirst She (Pamba river) cleansed our body, soul and the mind , the joy filled heart! She (Pamba river) cleansed our body, soul and the mind , the joy filled heart! SEE ME MY LORD! I SURRENDER TO THEE! This eighteen steps so hallowed! They take us unto your golden feet! O! O! O! O! Masi...err... See me Lord, my God O thee Aiyappa, I surrender unto thy feet WE SURRENDER TO THEE! AIYAPPA GOD! Next day morning, the singer doesn’t get paid. I was sitting right there, how can you sing so randomly? Oh, How can it slip? How can it slip? Such a legend Yesudas. Don’t you think? He’s been singing for a forty years and still going on. close to 50 years. Throughout this forty - fifty years, don’t you think, many a times, people would have approached Yesudas and given some ideas and all. Sir, In this song, why don’t you show some variety like Balu Sir? Start the song with a laugh. When you get to the stanza, add that raw RI-BA-RA-BA. And end it with a cry and go back to laugh again. If you do these, the song will take off to another level sir. He never did any of this…? He never did any of this… And we still adore him. We still love him. He is still a legend. That is when this strikes me, man. There is no point in imitating or copying other people, man. NO POINT. No point. Right? We should just focus on our strength. You focus on your strength, life will happen. God is there, life will happen. Overtime, whether we improve or not, the audience will be set and OK with our format. Life will happen, man. Life will happen. I finished all my schooling in my village. And for college, I came to Chennai. I saw Chennai for the first time. I came to Chennai, Ladies and Gentlemen! Tamil Film Music had a revolution. I mean, I came to Chennai on my own, the revolution happened on it’s own. I’m just saying, It just happened exactly at the same time. Such a coincidence. Exactly at the same time. And that revolution is called, A.R RAHMAN. YEAH! What a revolution, right? What a revolution. The first year, I clearly remember. I was in the first year, everybody was talking about ROJA. Have you listened to Roja songs? You have not listened to Roja songs? You have to listen to Roja songs! It is like Roja betelnut Radio advertisement. Have you tasted Roja betel nut? You have not tasted Roja betel nut? You have to taste Roja beta nut? Everybody in Tamil Nadu were doing radio advertisement for Roja movie songs. I got the Roja cassette. During semester holidays, I went back home. In my village, our place was the only one which had the old National Panasonic tape recorder. I don’t know if any of you have seen that. The flat one, you have to keep it in a stool and listen. It is called the sleeping model. I dropped in the cassette. Oh God I will never ever forget the first sound that came from the cassette, man. Tiny tiny wishes Wow The sound was so crystal clear. I could not believe it. Is this our tape recorder? The sound is crystal clear. Did you give it a wash? Such crystal clear sound, I’ve never heard from our tape recorder. I could not believe it. The sound itself was so different. The songs were so different. I look at the cassette label. Even that had surprises. It had all the songs listed, singer names listed. Underneath it said, CHORUS SINGERS: All the chorus singers’ names were written in there, man. All the chorus singers’ name were written there. Maestro could have at least done this, no? Everybody’s name was there. Drums – SIVAMANI. SIVAMANI’s name I saw for the first time. Sound Engineer – SRIDHAR. Studio Watchman – PONNAMBALAM. Everybody’s name was there. The housekeeper who cleans the studio – LAKSHMI AMMA Another lady who substituted for Lakshmi during holidays - SARASWATHI AMMA Wow… Everybody’s name was there. Underneath it said, Music by A R RAHMAN. Man, who is this man creating magic, giving credits to everybody in the world? Next day he was on Doordarshan. Rahman’s first interview on Doordarshan. Everybody was so curious to see. Who is this man? He came to the interview. All glory be to God. That’s all. He was done. First ten seconds, he was done. Rest of the interview, only the interviewer was talking. And he was so young. Twenty six or something. He looked short and the way he spoke, the way he looked. For whatever reason, he looked and sounded exactly like Sachin Tendulkar to me. Exactly like Sachin Tendulkar. The music was coming on to my piano. And boys did a great job on the harmony. I would like to thank Sivamani for the excellent drums. Sridhar is an amazing sound engineer. It’s a complete team work. He doesn’t talk this much and all. That All glory to God. That was it. And I was in the second year, Next magic came, BOMBAY. I got the cassette. I’m at the cassette shop, looking at the cassette label. There itself. I have not even opened the label. There itself I’m shocked. Song number 3 – Along the Arabian coast Singer – A R RAHMAN I was shocked and I was worried. All glory to.. How can one sing with that Sachin Tendulkar’s voice? I got some kind of anxiety attack. Man, I love you so much, but why, how can you sing? If somebody tells you, the next song is sung by Sachin Tendulkar… You’ll be like, OMG, I mean, he is God only. But why, who asked him to sing? Who gave this idea? You’ll be worried. Don’t you think? I had the worry. I was worried. How, why, how can he sing? So I fast forwarded and listened to that song first. And that song started with a big bang. (Hums the prelude of HUMMA HUMMA from BOMBAY) OH MY GOD. Such a power packed song, he is going to sing? I was even more worried now. YAA BEE YAY WOW. Such a big transformation within one year? But we look around, we ask, and they say, Oh, this is sung by one chorus singer, Remo Fernandes or somebody. And he is teasing. He is teasing you. Oh, you want to listen to Rahman’s voice? You’ve to listen to me first. I’m doing the opening act, yeah? He’s playing with you. Hey, let him sing, dude. After 30 seconds, Rahman finally starts. Along the Arabian sea (Sings with less audible voice) Our man didn’t commit (the voice) at all Not even a little. Completely. Not a tiny bit of commitment also. Al..Arb..Sea.. Are you getting an idea? That is the song. Go now. That Kapalabhati (yogic) breathing, complete breathing only he has done. Humma Humma Humma Humma Hummaa It is a complete Kapalabhati song, man. That song has so much energy, because of that pranayama breathing only. Yoga works. I’m telling you. Yoga works. And I was in the third year. Of course, every album is magic only. I was in the 3rd year. This big magic happened. KADHALAN (Lover boy). Oh My God. By this time, every time I go for semester holidays, my village friends, they’ll come home immediately. Bro, did you get Rahman’s new cassette, or not? Of course man. We all gather up. We all sit around. We all listen together. We dropped in the cassette. And the magic of course started. You remember SIDE A? First song? Opening song in Kadhalan. Maru ha baa (How are you?) We were all shocked and surprised. Why is the opening song itself all this sad? Because it had some pathos tone to it. (sings the Sarangi music from the song) They are playing the Sarangi also now. During those times, if Sarangi is playing, that means the Chief Minister has died. Most probably. If Sarangi is on, someone big is gone. That’s for sure. Maruhabaa… Maruhabaa… That Shahul Hameed’s voice and the sound of Sarangi mixed. For me, it sounded like this. what the old women in my village sing at someone’s death. I’m telling you it is a compliment for Rahman. It was that real, that intense, that piercing, that deep, man. For me, it sounded like this. My dear king! Your mighty land, you leave behind! What will we do without you? (Mumbles like the grieving old women from his village) O lamp of this clan! My beloved son! is down on the dirty sand! Suddenly the grandma music has become gala party music. That tum tum never stopped ya. The tum tum was so intense, that the tape recorder was jumping from the stool. Luckily we saw it. Dude, hold the tape recorder, hold it! Luckily we got hold of it. Otherwise, the only tape recorder would have fallen off the stool and broken. One guy had to hold the tape recorder for the whole duration. Finally, the song was starting. Urvasi.. (words not clear) What dude? Loose contact? Hold it tight, bro! I’m holding it tight only, bro. The tum tum was so intense, Urvasi could not get out of the tape recorder at all. Urvasi is giving up. That tape recorder is also giving up. That tape recorder is the old grandma. I can’t do this anymore. My times are over. Please don’t play Rahman cassettes in me anymore. I can’t handle these beats. Oh God, protect me. All my parts are falling apart. Please leave me. My time is over. Please leave me. Urvasi...si (words not clear) Are they talking about hunger? I don’t know bro. Then hold it tightly. I’m holding it tight only dude. Listen to me baby baby But where to listen? Tamil has got some 3 lakhs words! Sure it has. How can we listen? The guy holding the tape recorder, his hands are shaking. Our body has got some 6 lakhs nerves! Yes dude, I can see all of them. Throughout the album, the intensity only kept increasing, man. By the time, SIDE B last song happened, The roofs were coming down. The whole room was on fire! Everybody in the room was dancing. You remember the last song? SIDE B? Kadhalan? UYYALA UYYA LALA .. UYYALA UYYA LALA.. Muqala Muqabla Laila… O Laila… Muqabla So Cute you la O Laila So Cute you la O Laila Everybody was dancing… Especially the last part! Everybody was losing it! UYYALA UYYA LALA .. UYYALA UYYA LALA.. My God… You know what happened? Everybody in the room was dancing The guy who was supposed to be holding the tape recorder, Stupid fellow. He put it on the stool and he started dancing. By the time, (ending music of Muqabla) happened The only tape recorder fell down and broke, folks. We connected the wires and all, The last sound that came from the tape recorder was this. Gone O gone! The tape recorder is gone O gone! Gone man. The only tape recorder. Across the country, thousands of tape recorders got broken like that, man. All because of Rahman only. That is why he was given the title, 'the record breaking music director’. YES! What a journey, right? For 25 years. He only changed technology. I don’t think he follows technology. He’s changing everything. The sleeping model was broken. So, we go to buy a tape recorder. They say ‘There is no sleeping model these days’. Tape recorder is now standing. Standing model. It had two speakers. Stereo. That also Rahman broke after two years. We go buy another one. There is no standing now, tape recorder is now walking, Walkman. You’ve to walk with it. That walked off and it never came back. Then CD, MP3, piracy. So many changes in these 25 years. Don’t you think? Let’s fast forward life. We’ll finish with this story. Fast forward life, twenty years. Two decades later, Come this magic… Of course throughout the 20 years, magic after magic, magic after magic, Twenty years later, came this magic, JODHA AKBAR. I don’t speak or undertstand a word of Hindi even today. But I still go buy the CD, because, it is A R RAHMAN. I got the CD, I’m at the CD shop, I’m looking at the CD label, I was shocked again. Song number three, it said, KHWAJAJI. Singer - A.R.Rahman I was thinking to myself, OH MY GOD. The same song number 3, man. The same song number 3! Twenty years ago, I was thinking, why does he wanna sing? How can he possibly sing? Twenty years later, I’m now thinking, Oh I wanna listen to this song first. I want to see how RAHMAN has sung this song. I want to listen to this one first. Over these two decades, I’ve become a big fan of not just RAHMAN’s music, I’ve become a big big fan of RAHMAN’s soulful singing also. That’s when this strikes me hard man. You believe in something, Never ever worry about criticism. Keep doing what you believe in. That’s it man. Never worry about criticism. Keep doing what you believe in. Overtime, whether we improve or not, audience will get used to our format. Life will happen. We’ll finish with Khwajaji, When we do Khwajaji, we have to do it the Rahman way, don’t you think? Yeah? And we’ve to do, Rahman way, all the way. Khwaja Lord! Khwaja Lord! O savior of the poor! O keeper of the creed! O Khwaja Lord! O keeper of the creed! O Khwaja Lord! I was sitting in my room and I was crying man. I was in tears. I was telling myself, If God ever exists, If He exists ever, If He doesn’t come down for this music, what else will he come down for? That’s exactly what I was thinking. Khwaja O my true Lord May thy abode be my heart! Khwaja O my true Lord May thy abode be my heart! Khwaja Lord! Yes, Rahman, tell me. Khwaja here Khwaja Lord! This is Khwaja only speaking. Tell me what you need, dear Khwaja ji.. Khwaja ji I am still here. Tell me my dear You want couple of more Oscars? I can totally arrange, you deserve it. Tell me? Khwaja O my true Lord You have gone back to first line dear. What should I do now? I was so happy and I was so relieved when this song came in Tamil. I could understand the lyrics and all. This one: Lord O my true Lord Jesus O my true Lord Absolver of my misdeed Redeemer we trust indeed Jesus Lord! Our Jesus Lord! Jesus Lord! Our King Jesus Lord! Don’t look at me like that, it came, folks. Don’t judge me like that. OK, Jesus and all I slipped in here and there, Just for promotional purposes only. Today is Sunday. Isn’t? Every time I do these things, I feel this deeply man. I just replaced one word there, I put Jesus in there, The tune is so divine, that, I put Jesus there, I will feel the same divinity, I will feel with my favorite Jesus song. That’s when this strikes me very clearly. The words are many, but the tune is ONE. Similarly, Gods are many many. But the TRUTH I am sure is ONE. I’m sure it’s ONE. Truth I’m sure is one. We can replace just one word, this can become a beautiful Hindu devotional song also. Instead of Khwajaji Balaji (Lord Venkateshwara) Thirupati Balaji… Balaji… Seven hills Balaji… We came up through these sacred seven hills, Balaji! Come down and grant our wishes, Balaji We came up through these sacred seven hills, Balaji!
