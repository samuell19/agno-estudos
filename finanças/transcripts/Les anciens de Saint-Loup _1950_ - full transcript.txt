Stop. Goodbye. Goodbye. Hello, my child. - You going on a trip? Yes. I'm going to Saint-Loup. In Lot-et-Garonne? [N.B. French department, near Bourdeux] No, no. In Seine-et-Marne. [N.B. Department near Paris] Tickets, please. Which Saint-Loup? In Seine-et-Marne. "God has created you not only for this life. "It is given to you so that you may merit the life eternal. "Never forget this truth... "and help each other in this life... "in order to reach this eternal happiness." Lucien Châtelard, do you take Jeannine Langlois... here present, as your lawfully-wedded wife? Yes, father. You promise to keep her faithfully as is her right? Yes, Paul. Yes, father. Yes, father. Jeannine Langlois, will you take as your husband... Lucien Châtelard, here present? Yes, father. And you swear to keep him faithfully... Yes, father. according to God's holy orders? Yes, father... Yes, father. - Yes, father. Kneel. Take the right hand. I join you together, in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. And that's all. You see, it's simple. I wish you good luck. That's it. It's done and dusted. It lacked bells, an organ and decorations... but it is the best marriage I have made in Saint-Loup. Let's go and have a drink. You won't forget this barn. I would never have had another priest than you. When is the baptism? In 7 months. We will call it Claude or Claudie. Go on. Take it... our wedding gift. Pass it on. This will bring good luck. This will bring good luck? Thanks, kids. Now, to work. Go collect the firewood. Tell me... you will need a stable job, now. If I see my friend Laclaux, I'll speak to him about you. You are a brother, Paul. Laclaux will find a place for you. Think of it... the great banker Laclaux. Wait for me, Victor. This is going to take some time, are you coming? No. There will be your secretary and the stenographer... I would not like them to see me lacking courage. What a catastrophe. Old Laclaux was too cautious, but his son... he took a risk, he lost. Let's hope that the Lachênais group will agree to bail out the bank. Lachenais have called? - Not yet. And the balance sheet? - It's done. And the courrier? - Nothing. The director of Saint-Loup has revived his invitation. It's not the time. And my mail? I still have the solicitor's letter. I enclose, with this letter... the propiety titles of my real estate... as well as the securities and shares that constitute my fortune. These securities, assets and values ​... will have to be realized through your care... to be used for the reimbursement... Hello, yes? It's Lachenais. Yes. Okay? Good. I understand. Thank you. I will tell Mr. Laclaux. Mr. Lachenais apologises for not calling you himself... He has used all his influence... to obtain the support of his group, without success. They're beautiful, the French. For me, this is the end. There is no more Laclaux bank. Don't let this curtail your appetite. Have a good supper to my health. See you tomorrow. Home. Lachenais has refused? - Yes. He's only too happy to see my discomfort. As far as you're concerned, everything is taken care of. Your apartment is in your name. I have deposited your dowry... with the Bank of France. A solid institution. Guaranteed security. - You're only talking of me. What about you? - I have nothing more to give you. I'm taking back my freedom. I'll go to Morocco. With her? Catherine? I give you my word, I'm going alone. Until later. Jean... I've heard. Fourcade telephoned. Catherine. There you go. I'm finished in Paris. I'm going to Tangiers, to start again from scratch. I will be with you. Near to you. You don't know what it is to be ruined. You don't know what you're saying. I've nothing left. What about me? You think I'll let you leave? That I stay with you because of the money? You don't think much of me. We must be realistic. What? The difficulties, the deceptions? Let's not talk about it this evening. Don't think about it any more. Try to forget. Have you eaten? - No. I knew it. Fourcade told me that my uncle has written to you. About Saint-Loup. Go there. It would do you good to see your old friends. All that was a long time ago. What would we talk about? - About your childhood. You, you have some good luck. You have friendship, pals. Us, our memories start with the first kiss. You're charming. You should go. Fourcade will be there... as will your friend, Forestier. It's true, he has become the priest. That animal Paul. It would happen that I get the offer of a holiday the day I'm ruined. It will be missing Merlin. With Forestier, we were inseparable: the 3 musketeers. Where is Merlin? In China, in Tahiti, at the South Pole? Do you remember him? He escaped the walls of Saint-Loup... to go up to America on the eve of his exams. Yes, I remember. Here it is. The priest hasn't changed the place. Oh! Paul! Oh, oh! The little priest! Paul! Oh, Paul! Paul! Is there anyone? There's nobody. Yes, there's someone. Is the priest there? No. You want him to marry you? Marry us? He made one, a marriage, yesterday. Will he be back soon? He left on his bike, carrying his lunch. You tell him that Merlin is here. Come in, if you are Paul's mates. I'm Ernest. - Delighted. - How do you do? Go into the barn, I'll ask where Paul has gone. It's incredible! We have lots of places like this, in France. It's a barn. - What? A barn. - Don't be silly. Come in, you are with us. I've driven 5000 km to visit the château of Versailles... and I visit a... - Barn. And this is just the beginning. I should have been more wary of you. Yes, huh! You are unique. I should hope so. Admit that yesterday... it was a very agreeable to to dine in that guinguette. And like this, you have known... the miracle of the Marne. It was a victory? - Yes. But in times of peace, it's a plate of fried gudgeon. Are you okay up there? Yes, dear. You are amazing. But when I go back to America... my friends will say: "Barbara... "did you visit the Invalides?" How will I answer? That slumming it was more charming. [N.B. Literally "walking with fleas"] The Panthéon, it may be a distinguished cemetery... but it's not as good as those for the dogs. You are mad! - But no. I'd like that you say: "He never took me to a historical monument. "Instead we were together, in his home. With photos of his family." The priest will be spending the afternoon at the school of Saint-Loup. You want me to show you? - No, I know it. It was there that we undertook our studies. I've got you, punk. Let's go, to the police station. I was looking for you... You know him? That's nice. He stole my knife. A 750F knife. I made that in prison. So afterwards, you know how it goes. Leave him to me. He got away from your barn and you should be watching him. Be kind. When you lose your dog, you go out looking for it. I've never had a dog. It's okay because it's you. Take him and keep an eye on him. Say "thank you". I thank you. Let's go. Strange priest. One day, he's going to be killed. What do you want? To see Ms. Catherine Jacquelin. She left on a trip this morning. For a long time? I think so. As you can see, I'm tidying everything. Thank you. I'll write to her. Madame. It'll arrive before us. Ten minutes, that's nice. Perhaps you were growing roots... Lahulotte! - Subileau. You old coot! It must be at least 11 years since I've seen you. I'm a grower, what about you? I'm a lawyer. - That doesn't surprise me. Holy Subileau! You haven't changed. - Neither have you. Please, it's urgent. Come on, the old boys of Saint-Loup are there. According to Adam, it's not... The highest science, is it not, is the dialect. The dialect, does it not, leads to ideas. It's 2nd class, here, I have a ticket for the 3rd. What are they going to do? Old father "Is it not?", he was something else. Was it you who kept the June bugs? The June bigs was me. Ah! Oh yes, well said. Here are the two scions of France. Subileau, grower. Hello, Le Guellec. - Le Guellec is me. Patrice de Puy-Tïrejol. Yes, it's the marquis. I am the marquis, so I still am. My children, reassure yourselves... that it is not at the moment when you are going to leave school... that I'm going to inflict a speech on you. If I dared to imitate our immortal Bossuet... I would have written: "The scholarly year is dead, it is over." It is a demise that has always been welcomed with great enthusiasm... by all the schoolchildren of the world. You are about to enjoy a well-earned rest. Well-earned, in any event, by your teachers. Show me your hands. Oh! Still covered by ink. It couldn't be that you've been writing your memoirs? Come back in the autumn with cleaner hands. This school year, all things considered... has been quite satisfactory. Alas, once again... we have not been able to offer you every comfort... that we would have liked, but at least... Not longer than 3 minutes... Bruneto Félix, do you know what the word "silence" means? There is only one word with any meaning for you, the word "holiday". Well, your old school says to you: "Wait until next year." Go, you are free. Goodbye, sir. - Goodbye, sir. Have a good holiday. Be sensible. Goodbye, sir. Goodbye, Bruneto Félix. And be sensible. And enjoy yourselves. Goodbye and be sensible. They respect tradition, it's good to see. Who knows if I'll be able to reopen Saint-Loup? If I have to close my school, my life will be meaningless. What does the word "silence" mean? Raboisson. Marcel Raboisson. - Hi, old boys. Together again... Here's Saint-Loup, the old Saint-Loup. Oh! Stop, old boys. Oh! Oh! Hey, Saint-Loup! Oh, oh! How are you? - Oh, Caille! You remember? Abadie. Ah! How are you? The spirit of a reunion. The children make a register. It's an odd think they do, burying their classes. It's the tradition at Saint-Loup, like the elephants. These are the final minutes of the 5th class of 1950. Each class does its own register. We must speed up. Come on, hurry. We will miss the train. Well, children... Life is beautiful. Hello. Hi, colleague. Who are those old codgers? The old boys of Saint-Loup. Come on, children. Thank you. I'll be returning at 6pm. Don't tell your uncle that I'm ruined. Not another word between old friends. I don't want their pity. I am still a millionnaire. At 6pm. - Have a good time. Tonight, I won't be sleeping at Saint-Loup. Here they are. Reunited! No, no, it was up there that we buried it. Oh yes, I remember. - Even higher. I'll find it. I know where it is, it was me that dug the hole. This is it. I have it. Ah, that wasn't difficult. The philosophy class of 1938. - Pass it so I can touch it. I had my eyes. 11 years, it feels odd. It's normal. All our yesterdays. Make the roll call, priest. - Yes. Abadie. - Present. Espérandieu. - Present. Forestier Paul. Present Forestier René. Present for him. Laclaux? Present. - Merlin? Present for him. Lahulotte? - Present. Puy-Tïrejol? - Present. Subileau? - Present. Le Guellec? - Present. Raboisson? - Present. Everything we are doing is useless. Come on, it'll work out. Yes. It's them. Quick, quick. Here they are. We went through a lot here. Those were the good times. Bravo, Raboisson. Was it you who was ringing the bell? It's good to meet you again, headmaster. Me too, Raboisson. Headmaster! Reunited! Hello, Mr. Laclaux. - You haven't changed, nor has the school. Oh, yes. The school and I, we have aged. I'm so happy that we are here, together. And the foot baths? They are still compulsory? Yes. A little hygiene never hurt anyone. Who is this little one? One you have adopted? Yes, I adopted him on the road. How sad! A glass of wine awaits you. I'll join you there. Go on. One minute. Thank you, for the tradition. What is your name? - Emile. Emile what? - Emile, that's all. What would you say to a piece of bread, along with a bar of chocolate? Show him to the kitchen... and find him a more suitable jacket. Very good, headmaster. Come on, let's go. Hey! You want a hand? Haven't we gone on holiday? Are we being punished? I understand you. I jumped this wall 11 years ago. I haven't asked you for anything. Oh, excuse me. Sir is a tough guy. What is this get-up? They've slackened off here. I'm not from the school. The old man gave me them. I came with Father Forestier. - Paul? He's my buddy. I had nicked a knife. And Paul saved you from the consequences... and you thank him by running away? He should have left me. - He has a heart of gold. He rescued you, you're staying. You can see, cracked walls, broken-down heating. The roof is in a sorry state. Leaks everywhere, even in the dormitory. Good will is not, on its own, enough. Since your departure, nothing has been updated, because of money. Nothing has been updated. - It's pitiable. Your school is falling apart. Soon it will be a demolition site. Philosophy is not... is a fount of knowledge, isn't it... and a work of art. Here's someone! Merlin! Jean! I travelled from Martinique. - And Madagascar? Madagascar is a long way away. Great to see you again, Merlin. It's 11 years and 26 days since you jumped the wall... of Saint-Loup. Your comrades and I are making a tour of a great tragedy. Your old school. Look at it... the mold, the damp, the rust. It's a veritable shopping list of misery... that I want to show to you, my friends. Father "Isn't it?"! The likeness is striking... That's quite right. Careful. - I know the way. A staircase is condemned because of a landslip. And every day that passes makes the situation worse. There have been repairs... Is Ms. Catherine well? Very well. Thank you. She left me 3 years ago. She lives in Paris. Married? No. It's Victor Hugo. What's he doing there? Raboisson? You recognise him? - It's Jules. And the changing rooms? - In a state! Watch out! Danger ahead! Oh, my poor father has fallen. There are leaky taps, the piping... split. I only... barely touched it. It had had its day! Again, major repairs are needed. Laclaux? We had the same locker. Look, our 2 names. It's amazing. You remember the first time that we shaved? 3 unlucky hairs. At Vendôme, they have showers. Here we are stuck in prehistoric times. But the most upsetting is the dormitory. Come and see. Hey, Caille, come and see. What's up? There are showers here too. - That was sneaky. We were cold, but we slept well. There are ups and downs. - I see. Me, I'm stuck. If the bank will give me credit... It depends on my board of directors. You're not lacking, eh? I can't make an exception because we shaved together, 12 years ago... No. Here, look, gentlemen. Rain passes through the ceiling, the frame will eventually give way. My friends, I called you as an SOS... Why were you called ahead of the others? Because your class completed the subjects particularly brillantly... and have been highly successful in life. So, I thought... At least, I hoped... Oh, what I am asking, is is not for myself. It is for this old house which is in its death throes. It is for the children. There is a sum I greatly need. I think that with 2 million... I could repair the essentials. I am not asking for a gift, it is a loan. There it is. I will let you think on it. And I will allow you a break. 2 million, for his school! Well then! It would make a beautiful stables. Saint-Loup turns to you, you would get your bust. Lucky you. - Bank Laclaux will ride to the rescue. But it's perhaps that... Merlin... In the end, what is it that you do in life, exactly? Exactly? I install attics in new homes... to create memories for children. Playtime. And our secret society? The companions of midnight. The hour of crime is at hand. The password? - Fantômas. Destination? - Nesle Tower. Mission? - To smoke the pipe of peace. Fantômas! Was he never a kid? Well no, that's just it. They are having fun like children. Hop, Le Guellec. You have to know how to take care of his business. You're smart! - I've sold two beefstakes. But I must replace them. It's like I don't have a penny. Hey, are you breaking ranks? We'll be back. - Hey priest! Head down. Head down. Sorry, priest! And hop. - Allez hop! Don't move! Here neither, nothing has changed. What we smoked here! And all our projects, our pipedreams. You never told me, why did you jump the wall? I've never told you about it because... You're going to laugh. - Oh! It was a love affair. My first love affair. And the last. Yes. Since then, it's only been adventures. She was 15 years old, me 17. Like Romeo and Juliet. - Exactly. We met in secret, in the evening. - Oh! No, it wasn't like you think. We talked. And even then, not very much. There were many silences. We hardly dared to look at each other. It was because of her that I jumped the wall. You did something stupid, and were afraid of the consequences? You have a high opinion of me! No, it was nothing like that. You didn't recite poems? You kissed her? One time. Only once. The last evening. That night, I felt nervous, troubled. I thought it would be enough of a gesture. That was the night I fled. I had nothing to offer her. Twit! - Why? You hurt her. Women are realists. You left her the memory... of a fool. - It's a memory. She will have forgotten me. - She was from Saint-Loup? She came in by this door? What was her name, your Juliet? Ah, my fellows, I find you here having a smoke. May I. my son? - A light, father. So, what about the school? I hate blackmail. This reunion is utterly predictable. The headmaster put me on the spot in front of the others. I've had enough of being looked at... as if I'm the golden calf. I hoped not to hear talk about money here. All the same. - Its like that, being a millionnaire. It's not only that. There's something I must tell you... But no. Tomorrow, the 3 of us will have lunch. It looks like we'll be dining and sleeping here. I have to go. You are going to climb the wall? - Oh no. A lady is waiting for me at the bistro, I must warn her. See you soon. Right away. - In 10 years. No. Right away, that's a promise. Where have they gone? They had to go back for the wine of honour. There's no better invention than albuplast. Man's best discovery after the horse. Look, it's your niece. Catherine! This is an event. What have we done to deserve this visit? I'll leave you, I'm going to talk to her. It's a sentimental removal. Your taking your mementos. I came to say goodbye. Goodbye! I already see you so little. I'm going to Tangiers. - Tangiers. Yes, with Jean. You've come to collect Laclaux? Ah no! Heavens, no. I asked Laclaux for a loan for the school. I'm waiting for his decision. You won't take him away... before he gives me his answer? I'm leaving before I see him. You tell him to call me at the inn. Very well. Laclaux will not be able to advance you money. He won't be able to? Are you kidding me? You won't understand, but... Oh, it's terrible. Laclaux won't be able to. Soon, you'll understand. I'm escaping. I will write to you as soon as I'm there. Goodbye, uncle. - Goodbye. That's it, save yourself. Catherine? Merlin! Once upon a time, you called me Charles. It's true that we have grown up. You had to go on fabulous journeys. I have been around the world several times. And at the end of the day, it's a small world. You had extraordinary adventures. Oh, stunning. I ran into fearsome dangers. It was 9 years ago... I almost became a billionaire. I was starving in Pittsburgh... when a mattress manufacturer wanted to adopt me. The emperor of the mattress. All the continent slept on their trash. I would have been 50 times richer than Laclaux. I couldn't have held my head up. And you, tell me about yourself. Oh, me, life... Simple, like everyone else. You could have written to me. In 11 years, not one letter. I would have had too many things to say. What should I have done? Sent postcards? It's not my style. Before leaving, you didn't even warn me. Especially not you. You don't understand! Catherine... that night... our last evening... there was a terrible storm. When you came to join me, you were soaked. I wiped your forehead, your hair. You had a funny chignon. You were wearing a plaid skirt. Your corsage was yellow, with buttons to match. Charles... With red butterflies. You loved butterflies so much. On the fabric was printed a song in green letters. "Am stram gram..." "A green mouse running in the grass." Stop it. You were in the same place. I talked to you of Tahiti. We were going to go there together. Since then, I've been everywhere, except there. You had your head on my shoulder. There was the beating of that rain on the roof. I felt like everything was spinning. I kissed you. And I saw in your eyes that I had to go. What if I hadn't gone... No, leave me. You have to leave me. These 11 years haven't happened, we've been dreaming? Dreamed that we were separated, distant from each other? And here we are, reunited. You love someone else? It's my turn to be forced to run away from you. I asked you if you loved him. Not like I loved you. Except that we cannot love twice in the same way. But I love him, yes. Of course. Butterflies live for only one summer. They are too beautiful. Well, I hope you are happy. Very happy. Leave me now. We've spent our lives waiting for this, only to loose it again. And we have but one life. 6 months ago, I would have happily said yes... but all my disposables are taken. I have huge debts. Not to hide anything from you, Lalcaux bank is in difficulties. To this point? Say no more about it. Poor Saint-Loup. It represents so many memories for me and for you. Here, I wanted you to see these butterflies. They were caught by Catherine... when she was still a little girl. Her childhood home, isn't it? I know how much you are attached to Catherine. I had hopes for her... Whos that? I'm sorry to interrupt you... Rossignol sends a message that the builders are here. They are removing the scaffolding. This is madness! I'm coming. He wanted to sell them to me. They are cabbage butterflies. They're worth 5F a kilo. Allow me. When we love beautiful girls, we can perhaps love butterflies. On this subject... the person in question is waiting for you at Saint-Loup inn. He's losing his mind. What is this story? He was trying to appeal to my sentiments. It's his niece, Catherine, who caught them. An adorable kid. - But what's she to you? She's my mistress. Simple detail. - Your mistress? For 2 years. She had to look for work in Paris. She is wonderful. It's you. It's funny. What's that? - Simple detail. The little one that I loved back then, it was Catherine. Are you putting me on? Cabbage butterfly, captured in 1938... by Ms. Catherine. It's missing from the collection. Damn it! Catherine never said anything to me. I'd never have known. I would have preferred it to be someone other than you.. Mistress of the millionnaire Laclaux, that's great. You dare say that to me? We love each other. You are a positive man, you'll not go to the wall! I won't allow it. - You bought her. Everything is bought. Women as much as the rest. Money has corrupted you. And with money, everything is corrupted. Money! Idiot! Gentlemen. Thanks to the generous gesture of our friend Lahulotte... who has committed 50000F, we have reached 500000. Glory and honour to Lahulotte, from the bar in Poitiers. We ask nothing of the priest. The most beautiful girl in the world! Ah, Laclaux. All together... we've raised 500000 F. If Laclaux raises... the rest, it's done. I told you that the Laclaux bank is toast. You laughed. Well, it's the truth. The millionnaire Laclaux is no more. That's how it is. It's good to watch. A millionnaire who doesn't have a penny. I don't have a penny. Not a penny. I hope that you'll leave me in peace, now. I'm not concerned for him... he'll have taken his precautions. A little château... - Say that again. Let go of me. Say that again. If I'd known, I wouldn't have set foot here. I'm sorry I can't use my fists. He's the sort to wear a cassock, otherwise I'd have him. It's not getting better. Laclaux bank advanced me 2 million. Laclaux bank is bankrupt. Here, read. Ruined. - What? Laclaux is ruined. - No? "The bankrupt financier has disappeared." What? - Laclaux... has turned to dust. Laclaux bank has turned to dust. Allow me another extension. The developer won't agree. - But it's a crime. You must be reasonable. - Here's Laclaux. Why didn't you say? I was wrong, I'm sorry. I didn't want to darken this day. His sort, they want to be able to boast up until the very end. And me who asked you for work? - This changes nothing. Take this message to the Lachenais business. It was Lachenais who did for me. Jean, I was ridiculous... Catherine had a millionnaire lover... now that he is penniless, you ought to be happy. And Catherine? - I don't know. Nobody's seen her at the inn. I'll have to wait for her here. We will remember our visit. That we turned into a bunch of shady characters? And the palettes? I haven't seen them. Perhaps they are by the side. Good, here they are. Things are looking up. Are you suffering? - No, I'm fine. It's the heart. I ought to lie down. I was so much looking forward to having dinner with you all. I won't be able to. Give my apologies to your comrades. Hey, kiddo! Don't drag your jacket on the floor. Go on, go to bed. Hey, priest? It would be better with a zipper. Oh, go on, go on. - Okay, okay. I thought you liked a joke, the old boys. I can't wait until we do it again! I'm turning it off. Thief! Thief! Thief! - Get over here. Thief! Trash! I've got him. There, it's a dead woman. What? He's crazy. Who is it? - It's Catherine. She's been murdered. Don't touch anything. Don't touch her. Nobody must touch her. I'll alert the police. Jean! She loved me. It wasn't because of the money. She wanted to leave with me, even when I was ruined. Calm down. - She never loved you. Never. Shut up. You don't know what you're saying. - He didn't know how to love her. She didn't want him. All this with a woman dead. It's shameful. Where is the killer? You're going crazy. You're crazy! Careful, gently. It's nothing. That better? Yes, it's working. I have a thick skull. What do you have? - Me, nothing. I was seeing her again when he played in the garden. We were all in love with her, the only girl. You were in love with her as well? Well yes, me too. Our youth. We would have done better not to dig up the bottle. We wanted to be kids again. But it's not so easy. Not even for one day. Excuse me, old chum. Are you okay? - My anxiety. It takes me back. To know there is a death... it's more than I can bear. I'm afraid of death. I'm ridiculous. No, no. Go find the others Sending me to a friend? You're a priest, it's not the same thing. Forgive me. Father, I've come... You are a man to whom we can tell everything. I've come from someone who wants to right a wrong. I thought you might be able to... help me avoid a scandal. Yes, of course. Ah! - These need to be put back... in my nièce's bag before the police... There has been a crime. No, no, no. It's not the thief who is the killer. He stole after the crime. If I tell you, it's because I know it. Understand me, Forestier. I think I understand. The thief didn't want to hurt her. On the contrary, he had a lot of affection for her. But he's a sick, old man. And who deserves the title of a brave man. - Yes. They might say so I knew you would understand me. - Because I am a priest? No, not because of that. The less fortunate and the delinquents, I see them every day. This helps one understand. I couldn't even explain how I was capable of doing it. Madness. It was a despairing gesture. I had only one idea... to save Saint-Loup. You can rely on me, nobody will know. Oh, thank you. What's Duroc doing? He is with a woman who killed the mistress of her husband. Mrs Laclaux, let me read your confession. There's no point. Show me where to sign. Here, please. We had a marriage of convenience, here's how those end. Please. I'd like a glass of water. - Of course. Come. Give me 8 Saint-Loup, Seine-et-Marne. Yes. 2 times 4. That's it, thanks. Hello, hello! Yes. This is Saint-Loup school. Who's speaking? The C.I.D. Hello? The CID? Yes, this is Inspector Froment of Fontainebleau. Yes. What? What did you say, commissioner? Really? Yes, yes. Well, that's my inquiry over before it had started. I'll do the necessary. Goodbye, commissioner. It was Mrs Laclaux who killed your niece. Poor Laclaux. Will you come with me? - Please. There. Thanks. Are you going through Paris? Well yes, I have to, it's my route. Mr. Laclaux, Inspector Froment from Fontainebleau... wants to speak to you. Some news? Yes. The guilty one has been captured. It's a woman. It's Mrs. Laclaux. Blimey! - It's incredible. Ernest? Ernest? Ernest? Who's there? They've done in the priest. What? They've killed him. - It's not true. It's not possible. He bled out. And he's stopped moving. I'm afraid, I'm running away. Without him, what will become of us? We have no-one else. No-one else. Hand me the pillow. Don't trouble yourself so much. It will be my turn to go on holiday. The real one, the big one. I don't have any more reason to stay, I haven't managed to save Saint-Loup. Merlin? - Sir. Would you go and find me a glass of water? Forestier? Have Laclaux and Merlin made their peace? No, headmaster. What a shame! The headmaster has had another blackout. The doctor will see him. Father Forestier is at his bedside. Goodbye, Mr. Rossignol. Goodbye, Mr. Rossignol. - Goodbye. Safe journey. Goodbye. Keep us updated. I won't forget. - Goodbye. What a story. At least it will be a pleasure to go home. We never see each other. - Life... We should meet again. If you are in Paris, drop into my home. It's over there, it'll take 5 minutes. Who's there? - Laclaux, sir. I thought I recognised your footsteps. It's good you came. Raise his head. Thank you. Thank you very much I feel better. Much better. Gently. - It's the school? Take this, it will cover him. It's strange that the doctor isn't already here. Don't start thinking that I have become an old fossil. At heart, what I loved... was not so much an old school, the old stones. The past. It was the children. The future. Isn't it so, Laclaux? Yes, headmaster. Open the window. A little camphor will do him good. Children have a sense of friendship. One of the few things that matter. When a man loses that... it's a bad sign. Isn't it so, Merlin? - Yes, headmaster. It's why I'm pleased to see you. The 3 musketeers. Inseparable. The friendship... of three people. Because if a friendship like yours is broken... it would be more serious than if the walls of Saint-Loup crumble. Not on the stairs. Who can that be... but those savages? These are your students? Yes, headmaster. I ask your forgiveness. It's my little friend, Emile. Come a little closer. It's a school that has holidays. Like the brave Rossignol says: "When the cage is open, the birds sing." These are from Saint-Privat. Saint-Privat always break up for the holidays... 1 day after Saint-Loup. Then, at Saint-Privat, they sing about good cheese. At Saint-Loup... it's about the elephants. The elephants. The elephants.
