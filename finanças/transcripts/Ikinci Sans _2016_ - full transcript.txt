This is the day that I killed myself. It is sometimes necessary, to be born again. I'm not sure if this death would take me to heaven or hell. But I feel a peace inside that I've never felt before. A great peace. SECOND CHANCE 6 MONTHS EARLIER Don't leave without having breakfast! Come on. Cahit Arf. One of our most important mathematicians. Mustafa, welcome. Hi, Cemal. I hope you have a table for us. Of course. Mahmut, take good care of them. Right away, dad. -Don't call me "dad" in public again. -I'm sorry, Mr. Cemal. -Mommy? -Yes, sweetheart? -I want to ask you something. -Go ahead, sweetheart. Me and my friends, we want to go to the seaside. -I see. -I mean... -Here you go. -Thanks, mom. -Have fun. -See you. Good bye, teachers. -Bye. -Where is the princess going? -They will take a walk by the seaside. Which seaside? Both Kilyos and Bebek are by the sea. It's better to know, Yasemin. There are lots of weird men out on the streets. What are you saying? She is just a child. I'm not sure if you are ready to hear this from a man like me. But I just can't keep it to myself anymore. I've been thinking about your long hair, big eyes and soft skin all day. -It's coming if you're ready. -Let's do it. On the crow's feet. Just a little. Go on with your rehearsal. I realise that it's too early to say big words. But I just can't keep it to myself anymore. I want to get to know you better, if you are ready too. "You're such a funny boy..." "And you're really pretty. May God protect you." Guys, the boss is on it. Let's go watch. What? Who is it this time? He picked her out of a group of girls who came for a birthday party. Alright, guys. I am starting the bet. Who is betting for under or over 23? Is there a handicap? "I'll be back in 5." It is really hard to hear these things from men in my age group. You are using words that please me as a young lady. -Enjoy. -Is this for me? -Yes, it's for you. -But what is this 23? It was your birthday last time you were here, so I thought that... -But I'm 22. -Really? Mr. Mahmut, if you're done, could you please leave us alone? Sure, dad. Mr. Cemal. You see... When you employ this many people, you become like their father. Did mom have dinner? Don't forget her medicine, please. Don't worry, sister. Mom is doing alright. She's already sent one of the nurses home before I got here. You should let me know when you'll be here. I'll make my plans accordingly. Okay, honey. Don't forget to put lemon in her water. And take care of the garden. You know, she is obsessed with her flowers. Alright sister, I know. You tell me the same thing every time. I'm telling you, so you don't forget. Take care of mom until I get there. I'll call you later. Okay, don't worry. See you. Mom, I've warmed up the room. Let's get you up. Who I'm seeing is none of your business. What are you saying, Cansu? Of course it's my business. I'm your mother. Enough, mom. I don't like it that you are so involved in my life. You are my daughter and my responsibility. Protecting you is my duty. You're seeing the wrong people. I can decide who is right and who is wrong because I'm a grown-up now. EPISODE 116 THE END People will have hunchbacks in 50 years because of this technology. Sit up straight, dear. Mom, go back to the couch and string your beans there. I've been there for four hours. The episode's just ended, and I'm bored. Let me see who you are chatting with. -With my friends. Come on, don't try to fool me. Let me see who he is. -Stop, mom, why would you look? -Honey, I'm just curious. Stop, I'm writing something here. Are you hiding somethingâ€€from me? Stop. Take it. "Never be a woman who strings beans, sitting in front of the television." Great. You are chatting with a boy, and I am the subject? There is a game on TV, but Mister Mahmut isn't watching it. What are you doing? Nothing. Just chatting with a friend of mine, dad. I'll deduct 100 liras from your salary each time you call me "dad". Am I supposed to call you "Mr. Cemal" at home too? Fine. It's okay at home. She's a beautiful friend. -She is below your age group, dad. Look at you! I'll see you when you're 40. Look at that. You're having a chat about beans! What can I do, dad? I've been caught up in this bean issue for a long time, I can't get out of it. Write something nice to the girl, man. "What kind of woman do you imagine me to be?" We need to ask this. Answer her. Stand up. -What? -Move aside. Let's use my repertoire. Watch me. "A woman is a nurturer. She feeds her baby and nurtures nature." She nurtures art with her existence. She nurtures a man's heart with her beauty. I'd like you... "I'd like you to be a woman who nurtures me... ...either with beans or your glances." How old is this boy, saying all these big words? What if I'm not as beautiful as you'd expect? Enter. -Mom... -Let's see what he says. Alright. What if I were to find many beautiful aspects of you? -Which book did you steal this from? -Mom. Hold on. I'm not exactly a poet, but... "But I can make impressive sentences for the right woman. This is all me." Do you like reading? -Too boring. No more boring than beans. Let's see because it's important to know if he likes reading. Do you read? "What can be better than the smell of a book... ...which makes you feel like you are living different stories in new worlds?" I really like this boy. I'm going to take a shower. And then, I'm going to go to sleep. I hate the boy now because of you. Goal, goal! Goal, dad, goal! Well, let's get to know you better, young man. Have you ever had a date with this girl? No, dad, never. Why would she be interested in me? I'm just by myself... How did you miss that one? "Tell me about yourself." Get ready for your first date. "My dad has an excellent restaurant. I work there." "What is your dad like?" "He's a very handsome, charismatic man. I wish I looked like him a little." "What kind of music do you like?" "I like oldies. From the 70s, 80s and so on." "I like those years too." "Nilufer, Kayahan, Baris Manco etc." "See, we're alike." "Well, which movies do you like?" "Old Turkish movies." "The movie 'My Dear Brother' always makes me cry." "You think very maturely..." "How old are you?" "Just kidding. 19..." "Why don't we meet up?" "Okay, come to the restaurant. Cemal's Steakhouse, Taksim." "Deal." "Delete All" Mahmut, come on. The kitchen here is as big as our restaurant. Yes, son. We're building a huge place. All Istanbul will talk about this place. Go put on something decent, and come to the restaurant. Cemal's Steakhouse Welcome. Do you have a reservation? Yes, I'd like to see Mahmut Yilmaz. Yes, madam. Here is your table. -Where is the bathroom? -Straight ahead, to the right. It's okay, I'm calm, I'm calm. Welcome. Your table is over there. Put them down. Let someone else do it. Don't get your clothes dirty. I'll need you soon. Okay, dad. Mr. Cemal. Madam, this table is reserved. My friends can arrange another table for you. Guys! -You invited me here. Me? Why did I invite you? What's the problem? Am I not your type? I'm sorry, what is this about? Are you not ashamed of seducing young girls? -Which young girl? -And he's asking which girl! I'm saying that you're a grown man! Don't you feel shame coming on to young girls? I'm sorry, who are you? I'm the mother of the girl that you tried to seduce. You are Ece's... Filiz... Of course, Burcu's mother. Okay, okay. Your daughter and I are taking our relationship seriously. She was going to introduce me to you once we got to know each other better. Would you like to drink something? Are you hungry, auntie? Auntie? Mahmut. Mahmut. Who is that woman with your father? If I ever see you around my daughter, I'll rip your dyed hair out! What? It's not dyed. It's something that I apply to cover the grey. I'll rip it out! I'm sure it's the mother of one of the girls. Well, who says Ipek, and who says Burcu? -Burcu, Burcu. -Ipek. Please, don't yell in public. This is a respectable place. Yes, it is, but you are not respectable. Everybody needs to know what a jerk you are! -What? Jerk? -Yes, you old geezer! Look at yourself! You're an eyesore! -I'm an eyesore? You're a douchebag! -Hobo! You bastard! Move aside! -Get out of here, maniac! I don't want to see you or your daughter here ever again! -What happened? Who was she? -She might be Burcu's mother. Burcu. Mommy, I'm home. Mom? -You'll never see that man again. -What man? You'll never see that man you were chatting with again. You mean Mahmut? Yes, Mahmut. The infamous Mahmut! That man is a bastard. -Mom, what are you saying? I'm saying I went there and saw him. He puts a photo of a young boy on there, and hunts young girls. -Mom, where did you go? -To the restaurant. Mom, what are you doing behind my back? Shut up. I'm your mother. Protecting you is my duty. Fortunately, I went there and saw him. You think that you are writing to a boy of your age. But he's a grown man! Mom, Mahmut is 19 years old. What grown man are you talking about? "Can we talk?" Is that him? Yes, mom. I'll answer him if you allow me. Look at him! That's why some people become murderers. "What a shameless man you are! Jackass!" Me? "Can you turn on your webcam?" Here you go, mom. Let me introduce you: This is Mahmut. -Mom? -Who are you, son? Mahmut, I'm so sorry. I heard my mother went there today. I guess there was a misunderstanding, but I don't really get it either. I wanted her to see you to make her feel better. Okay, okay. Now, I get it. So, the woman who came here and swore at my dad was your mom. Mom, did you swear at his dad? Of course not. He was the one swearing at me. Who is that man, son? What? Who is he? That man is my father, auntie. Look, he calls me "auntie" too! Mom, calm down. -You! -How do you know this lunatic? Dad, for God's sake, keep calm. -Wait! -You are the lunatic! Watch your mouth! You yell at me, and you chat with boys? What is your problem? -What is your problem? You invited my daughter to the restaurant, and then... Don't trust your dad, son. Get out of here! Why would I be interested in a woman like you? You should pray for a woman like me! If I see you around this restaurant, I'll call the police. I will report to you to the police. I will ruin your reputation. -Eat this. -Get the hell out of here! I'm in my own house, idiot! Oh my God, he's on fire! Oh my God! Mom... Mom... I'm on fire! I'm on fire! I'm on fire, son! Well, I was just trying to protect my daughter. You know, Istanbul is dangerous. There are lots of weird men around. Mom! I'm sorry. Excuse me? I couldn't hear that last thing you said. I'm sorry. Turn down this music, guys. Nobody can hear each other. Excuse me. I am sorry. Okay? Today, your mom's voice could be heard even across the street. Now, she speaks quietly. I'm sorry! I'm sorry, okay? -Okay. -Okay? Aren't you going to apologize? -Why am I supposed to apologize? -Maybe for those things you said to me. -I didn't say them without a reason. -So, I deserved it? -Well, kind of. I can't take this anymore. I really can't. Dad, the girl is leaving. She left, dad. Mahmut, tell your dad not to push it. Don't say "dad". Please, I beg you. I'll solve this. I'll solve this and call you, okay? I'm so sorry. The building is beautiful, but we talked to the city hall,... ...and the auction was over. We need to talk to the company that bought the place. They said we should convince them. But they never said who bought it. It's confidential or something. As if we plan to open a bar! We just want to educate kids and do charity. What's the point of making it so difficult? We can all get together and talk to that man. He'll accept if he's human. Yasemin, where are you? Your head is not here. I'm worried about my daughter. She's growing up and becoming a teenager. She was chatting with a boy recently, and I had to deal with his dad. The man is such a jerk. -What did you think, Yasemin? You raise a princess, and then a jerk comes and takes her. This is the rule of nature. Which one of us found Prince Charming? You are putting me off marriage. You should find someone first, and we'll warm you up again. Arif, please make this part open so that people can see the view while eating. It would be a shame if we covered it up, Cemal. But the building is a little old. We'll need to renovate inside and out. Do whatever is needed to be done. Have a nice day. -Thanks. Oh God... -Won't you answer it? -Why should I? Sweetheart, please don't be mad at me. You know, your grandma isn't doing well. I'll have to go there soon after you graduate. Your aunt can't stay there anymore. I'll always worry about you. I just want to be at peace. I want you to have good people around. -Mommy, I know. But why don't we give people a chance before deciding if they are good or not? Smart aleck! Turan, I'm your tenant for 20 years. What the hell does 60 thousand dollars for rent mean? Cemal, that's the only place that brings me income. There are lots of other people around who can pay 60 thousand dollars. Okay, okay. At least, let me stay until we move to the other building. After that, rent it out to anyone you want. I'm your tenant of for 20 years! I have paid you two times more than what the place cost! What are you saying, Cemal? Did I not hang up the phone? Turan? Turan? I've just entered a tunnel. Hello, mom? Yes, Meltem? Mahmut just called. He told me something about a girl. You gave me a promise when I sent the kid to you. Keep your promise. -I'm keeping my promise, Meltem. You were the one who brought this surprise into our life. I'm teaching him the job here. He has his own car, and enough money in his pocket. He eats what I eat, and he lives the life I live. Don't call me every day to teach me how to be a father. What a father! Who thinks that you are really a father? Don't insult me, Meltem, as if I wanted to have this kid. You've raised an idiot for a son! I'm teaching him how to be a man. For God's sake. By the way, you aren't the one who sent him here. You got married there, and he came here by himself... ...because he was mad at you. You should first learn how to be a mother. The building looks very old. Its roof might be leaking. It needs to be renovated completely. Everything can be done if they give it to us. Nuran worries about everything today. It might be because her husband hasn't been home for a week. I have a husband at least. You tell us, what are you doing all alone? -What are you talking about? -You know what I mean. You have nothing to do, and now you are picking on me? You don't have a husband or a boyfriend. Are we going to talk about this in the teachers' lounge? -Why not? I'm so curious! -Me too, me too. I do nothing. You have been single for 7 years. You're only 40 years old, and you don't do anything, is that so? Let's change the subject. We were talking about the roof, how did we get from there to my down under? My God. Come here. Okay, I don't do anything. But it doesn't mean that I don't need it or want it. -So, you're looking forward to it? -You have no idea! She is just like a time bomb! Wait, wait. My husband found the man. Let me see. His name is Cemal Yilmaz. -Wait, wait. I wonder if he treats women the same way he treats food. -He is such a playboy. -Look at that. He's very unlikeable. -He's handsome, though. -You have no taste at all! I'm sorry to bother you. Yasemin, can we talk if you have time? I'll be downstairs. Have a nice day. I'll tell you later. Yasemin, I have been so rude to you. I'm sorry. I came here to apologize to you. The kids shouldn't go through this because of us. They are young. You can trust Mahmut. Mahmut is a good boy. I really like your daughter, Cicek. I'd like to invite you to the restaurant if you are available someday. Look, Cemal, my daughter is 18 years old. I don't want her to have unreliable people around. I understand. No, you don't, because you don't have a daughter. Okay, I accept your apology. Alright. I don't want to keep you anymore. Thank you. -Have a nice day. What a coincidence! Do you remember what I told you about my daughter? He is the father of that boy. He was just apologizing to me. -Or, what good luck! -What good luck? He's the groom's father. It will be easier to convince him to give up the building. -What groom! -No, no. Yasemin, she is right. You are the only one who can convince that guy. Come on, go there, talk to him nicely and get that building for us. Okay, okay. I'll go to the restaurant and talk to him. Yasemin. Use your femininity. Okay. Hello? -What are doing, sis? How is it going? It's fine. I'm getting ready, putting on my makeup. Why? No, it's nothing like that. It's just a job interview. Are you going into business? Nergis, I broke my zipper trying to explain myself to you. You may lose some weight because of that job. Okay, don't talk too much. I'll call you later. Come on, one of you, answer me. You heartless people. I'm dying here. -Welcome. -Is Cemal here? -He is not here today. -Welcome. Can I help you? -Yasemin? -I guess this wasn't the best time. No. It's just that I wasn't expecting you. I have a cold. I'm sorry. I can't think straight because of the medication. There's a lot of it going around. You should be careful. Yes. Come on in. -No, thanks. It's very cold out there. Please, come on in. Okay, just five minutes. Come sit down, Yasemin. Come. You're coughing so badly. It would make you feel better if you ate a mix of ginger, quince and honey. Yeah... But I have no energy. The kitchen is over there. There is quince and ginger too. But I feel so tired. Would you like some more? It already made me feel better. I actually came here to talk to you about... I know, this is not the right time, for sure. There is this association founded by my friends and me. We founded it for kids. We need a location. We want to organize fashion shows, concerts and suchlike. We need a place for all this. We talked to the city hall, found a place, but you've already bought it. So, I'm saying what if... Cemal? Cemal? Cemal? You've got a very high fever. Oh my God. What was that? What was that? What did I see? What, Mahmut? Wait, wait. Don't hang up, Cicek. I saw something, and I must tell you about it. I came home, and there was a woman with my dad. Why should I care, Mahmut? -She was your mom. -What? My mom? I'm not finished yet. My dad had his hand on your mom's boob. I can't believe this. Mom? It's very weird. What are you doing? Burcu, I'm so glad you're here, dear. Filiz, is that you? Cansu? Yasemin! Yasemin, I'm so sorry! It's the fever! My hand did it by itself! Good God... Mom. Oh, dear, is that you? Did you... Did you eat something? You must be hungry. Let's do, I mean... Let's think about something to cook. How come you didn't ask him? He had a terrible fever. How could I? Look, Yasemin, we don't have much time. The association needs to be made official. We have a lot of stuff to do. The fashion show, the concert. Okay. Put that thing out. Somebody will see us. -Okay. -Come on. He's calling me. -Answer it. Close the door. I'm really sorry for yesterday. Due to the fever, my hand... Anyways, never mind. Thank you so much for the tea. How are you now? Do you feel better? I feel better. Your tea did what a lot of medicines could not do. It's a recipe that I learned from my mom. I also want to return your favor. I want to invite you for dinner this evening, if you are available. To the restaurant, this evening? Hi. -Welcome. -Are you closed? We are making renovations today. So, we're closed. It's all at your disposal. Let me take that. -No, thank you. -Just one glass. Okay. I'll be right back. I've heard the name of this place but I never had a chance to come. We have really good dishes. Bring your friends someday. I'll prepare a great menu for you. The girls can't come here. We would have to give you all of our wages. Alright. Did you cook this? This is actually my job. I mean, the kitchen. -It looks so good. -Enjoy. I was 24 years old when I first came to Istanbul. My uncle used to have a stand in Yenikoy. I started by cooking meatballs there. And then, one day, Fikret, the former owner of this place came. He ate my meatballs. He loved them. He wanted me to work for him. I accepted and came here. This was a very small place. Two people hardly fit in it. We became famous all of a sudden. Everybody started to talk about our meatballs. One day, Fikret got sick. He was already an old man. He thought about selling this place. I took a risk, and ran up a really big debt. I changed everything, I just left that chandelier over there. I didn't have the heart to replace it. It's a reminder of him. There is also a gramophone left from him over there. That's it. This is all I could do in 20 years. -What else do you expect? -Not enough. We'll expand more. -It's very tiring. -Life is tiring. I never expected to hear something like this. It seems more like it was inherited or something. Yes, it might seem so from the outside. But there are always many difficulties behind any success story. What is your story? It's simple. After I graduated from college,... ...I started to teach math in private schools. I have my mom who lives in Ayvalik. Since my dad died, my mom has not really wanted to live. Old lovers. When one dies, the other wants to go with them. That's my story. My daughter, my mom, and that's it. What about Cicek's father? Are you separated? Why did you separate? Because he still had a teenager's libido. He found a young girl, and left. And while leaving he destroyed everything inside me. Anyway, we got married at an early age. So, we couldn't make it work. It's not so different in my hometown, it's even worse. Once a guy starts to earn his bread, they force him into marriage. Before becoming a man, he becomes a father of eight. Dreams and stuff come to nothing. Well, you don't even dream in the first place. They made me marry too. Meltem was a nice girl. She was nice, but not a match for me. I had dreams like moving to Istanbul,... ...doing different things, and finally I came here. I only found out that she was pregnant after we separated. She had given birth to the baby, just to make me go back to her. But I didn't. The kid was raised there. His uncles took care of him. Oh, my dear. So, he didn't look for his father. I didn't want to go back either. I didn't want to be involved with that family again. Then, one day, I came here and I saw a boy sitting. "Who are you, boy?" "I'm Mahmut." That's when it hit me. His mother got married again. My son resented it, and came here. He stayed one day, two days, and finally settled here permanently. Mahmut is a kid who was caught in the middle. Wow... He turned up after many years. Do you see yourself as a father or as his father? Actually, I want to be honest with you. This is a very new situation for me. And I'm trying to get used to it. What happened? This feels really good! I swear, I haven't had such a heart-to-heart talk in a long time. I'm glad you're here. Welcome. Thank you. He passed by it, but later, realized that it was his own car. -Here we are. -Here? Good night. -Good night. I forgot! -What did you forget, mom? I forgot... The things from the grocery store. Why are you up at this hour? You have to sleep, but you're still up. Look, what if I change the color of the restaurant in the new building? What about doing something different? -It's really nice here. Right? I like it too, but I thought a new color might be good too. Here, right here. He treated me so kindly. He cooked. We sat and we ate. Then, we talked. What could I do? I couldn't open up the subject. Why are you laughing? It's nothing. The building's roof just came into my mind. Look, don't make that roof joke anymore. Someone will hear it. I'm telling you girls, if we don't apply within 15 days... ...all those events will have to be cancelled one by one. Look at me, Yasemin, solve this matter first. And then, you can flirt with the guy. What flirting, for God's sake? Come on, call the man. Solve this matter. Clean this up, guys! Come on! Hello? Hi, Cemal. I'm sorry to bother you. No problem. I was going to call you anyway. Thank you so much for the conversation we had yesterday. Thank you. It was a really nice night. Get to the point. Get to the point. I'd like to talk to you about something. Cemal. -Halil! -How are you? Look, we're starving. I came with the whole family. Alright. Boys, a table for Halil. Enjoy. -See you. Son! Yes, I'm listening. Boss, let's call that foreman. He connected the gas pipes wrong. -Well... -What natural gas! Okay, go. Come on, I'll be right there. You're busy, I guess. I can call you later if you want. No, no. Please. You know what... Please come to my place tonight. We can talk more comfortably. I'm inviting you to my house. He's inviting me over tonight. -Say "yes"! -Go! Well... She'll fail again. -Okay. I'll be there at 7pm. -Alright. Seref! Wow. Boss, I've been working for you for 10 years. This is the first time you wanted such a table prepared in your house. Normally, you always use the restaurant for this kind of thing. Women make men cherish many firsts till death, Seref. Don't forget this. Wait, I'll get it. Wel... ...come. We designed the upstairs as a dormitory for the kids. We'll divide the mid-floor into separate classrooms. The garden is also very useful for... ...the concerts and fashion shows that we'll organize. That's why, we love this place. We... Did you taste the quinoa? You want to make this place a restaurant,... ...but we thought that you may use it for charity. I must get this recipe from you. This is the chef's secret. Please, tell me. It's a secret. If we work for three months, it'll be done. There are a lot of firms supporting us. There are some construction firms. Look... I know you're trying to do good things. I'd like to help you. But I can't. This is a place I've been chasing for a long time. I've been waiting for this auction for five years. This is also the best place for my restaurant to move into. I'm sorry, I can't. You're such a wealthy person. You can easily find another place for the restaurant,... ...but we don't have such an opportunity. Me neither. This place is my dream. So, your dreams are more important than the children's future? Look, this restaurant is my child. Please understand me. I can't do this. Come on, girls, come on. What can you expect from a guy who doesn't call his own child "son"? I'm a bit tipsy because of the wine. Tomorrow, I'm going to do an oral exam on today's subject. I treat dishes the same way I treat women. My mom won't let me see you, but I'll find a way to meet with you. You can go. We'll talk about other things later. I think, if one can find the perfect match,... ...the marriage will last happily ever after. Everyone is meant for someone in life. But the real problem is, who is meant for who? That is not certain. I think I have a curse or something. I don't know. I just started to think so. Or, I'm matchless. Let's make a toast, then. Honey, I'm going to Nuran's anniversary, I won't not be late. There's food in the fridge. Be back on time, okay? Cicek. Mr. Cemal? Who was that guy? Mert. An ex-boyfriend of mine. We still see each other. You won't tell my mom, right? No, no, I won't. You're not talking to Mahmut anymore? We sometimes send cartoons to each other. That's all. It's friendly. -I see. I came here to see your mom. Is she home? No, my mom went to a party. She's not home right now. Mr. Cemal, you won't tell her, right? No, I won't. Cicek. Where is this party? He's a science teacher. He's handsome, right? Come on, let me introduce you to him. Don't be ridiculous. I won't go around meeting people at this age. Are you crazy? What is wrong with your age? Well, we should just die then. Life starts after 40. Look at Evren. She caught that handsome guy. Isn't that Cemal's chef? Yes, he skipped work and came here. You let Cemal get away. At least, don't miss this one. What do you mean I let Cemal get away? Wait a minute. What were you thinking when you sent me to his restaurant,... ...and to his apartment, for God's sake? I wanted you to be happy. Are you cold? You like water. You're even more beautiful tonight. You don't feel cold, right? -No, no. I don't. I'm sorry to bother you, but you're so sweet. How long have you been married? We've been dating for two months. -Would you like something, honey? -Just bring me some water, darling. Your wish is my command. -Are you married? -No, I'm divorced. You'll feel so alone when you get to my age. You should find somebody to love while you're still so beautiful. Dear, happy anniversary. Thank you. Good night. He's so cute! Look! Look! I'm not ready for this. -Mom? -What are you doing? You're everywhere! For God's sake! I was scared to death! Mom, is there something you'd like to tell me? No, honey, what shall I tell you? -Mom, tell me! I'm dying to know! -Sweetie, it's nothing like that. We were talking about the building,... ...and then, it happened. There is nothing going on. Mom! I saw you. He kissed you after he brought you home. -Are you peeking out the window? -Mom, don't try to change the subject. Come here. Look, honey, I have no expectations from anybody. I just want to make sure that you are in safe hands here. Then, I'll go to your grandma's place as soon as my assignment is confirmed. My mom is there, and you are here. I have no time for this kind of thing. Mom, don't worry about me anymore. I'm a grown-up. Yeah, right! If I left for two days, you'd be stuck here playing with your own poo. Mom? You know what? I think you are a perfect match for each other. And I really like Cemal. He's a handsome, charismatic guy. Women adore him. I think it'll work. That's the problem. He's just like your father. Come on, mind your own business. Did you study? Okay, teacher! 10 Missed Calls Hello? I always forget that you're a teacher. You were in class, right? Yes, it's the break now. I have another class soon. If you are available this evening, I'm going to pick you up at 8pm. I have a surprise for you. A surprise? What is it? I'm going to take you somewhere. It's important to me. I'll be happy if you come. -Okay. -Okay. Then, I'll pick you up at 8. Did you put acid in this, man? -You wanted it hot, boss. I said hot, I didn't say kill people. Make it less hot. Then, it got dark suddenly. Nothing could be seen. We could see the land, but not the bow of the boat. Then, we heard a loud noise. It turns out, we came across a shoal of gurnards. Thank God, they didn't hit anybody. Otherwise, it would have killed them. We went fishing, but we couldn't catch anything. We got upset, but then, we saw that the boat was full of fish. I couldn't figure out whether I was lucky or not. This is Cemal's luck. When he looks for something, he can't find it. But when it comes to him, it's too much. No, no. He seems to have found it this time. Come on, guys. We only live once. Come on! Yes! I'm really happy. We are always used to seeing silly women around Cemal. I'm so glad he met someone like you. -Am I supposed to be pleased? -Of course, be pleased, dear. Wait, wait, wait. What was the surprise? You. -What was important for you? -You. I wanted to introduce you to my friends. Go on studying. Do you know what the trick is? When you put this in, it changes. Are you ready? It's so good. That's the trick. And then, I said: "I can jump out of here." They said: "For God's sake, man." And I replied: "What? I can do it if the others can." The third floor... -Mom. Mom? Why did you come without notice? Cicek is all grown up. Am I supposed to get your permission to see her? -Mom, calm down. -Shut up. At least, come alone. Why do you bring your young girlfriends with you? I didn't bring her into the apartment. She's waiting outside. Look, let me remind you of something. You live on what I provide for you. Watch how you speak to me. Never try to turn my daughter against me. You'd think that you're a true father. I'm the one raising our daughter. She has nothing to learn from you. You're a man who abandoned us and ruined our life! That's it! Got it? Always the same things. Enough. I don't want to listen to this anymore. Is the value of this function constant? Yes, Efecan? -It is constant, madam. The value remains the same even if X changes. No, madam. It can't be constant... ...because the value changes according to the variable values of X. X and C are real numbers. The value of sine pi equals zero. So, the value of the function is C, regardless of the value of X. Efecan is right. The value doesn't change. It's constant. It was a nice movie. Would you like some water? -Okay. BLONDE BUDDY: Image "I miss you, daddy" If you're available this weekend,... ...I'll take you to a beautiful place for breakfast. It belongs to a friend of mine. A fantastic place in the woods. You have met him. Selim. He was at the table that night. I'm going to wash my face. I need to go. -It's not late. You can stay. -I should go. What happened, Yasemin? Yasemin. Yasemin. I... I don't think I can do this. No. Please don't come with me. Please. Yes, Seref. Boss, Mahmut has been staying with me for a few days. He looks upset. He is saying things like "I'll leave tomorrow". Maybe you should talk to him. Don't let him go. Tell him not to be ridiculous. I'll come in the morning to talk to him. -Okay, boss. "I miss you, daddy" Mahmut! Mahmut! It's okay, no problem. Mahmut! Where are you going, son? I'm going to Antep, dad. Antep? What's this all about? I have a friend of mine who lives in Antep. A childhood friend of mine. I called him. He found a job for me there. I'll go and work there, dad. I promise, I won't be a burden either to you or to mom anymore. -Who says you're a burden, son? -I'm a burden, dad. When I came from Diyarbakir, I thought my dad would maybe like me. He would hug me when saw me. He would call me "my son". You always tried to send me back, dad. I said "okay, maybe he'll like me in time". He'll call me "son" and hug me. I called you "dad", you got mad. You never watched a game with me,... ...never slept next to me, never ate with me... ...and never ever carried me on your shoulders. I've been raised as if I'm a bastard. There was a crippled man called Osman in our neighborhood. He carried his son on his shoulders everyday despite being crippled. I used to get upset when I saw him. I said to myself: "Why don't I have a father?" I don't know whether I exist or not. You didn't notice that I didn't come home for three days. But you're right too. Sometimes, I look at myself in the mirror, and I say to myself: "Mahmut, look at yourself. Why would they like you?" Now that woman has come into your life, you'll forget about me completely. It all happened one after another... I heard from Antep, and I thought about what to do... Dad, I know you hug me because I am miserable now. You don't love me. I am the miserable one, son. I am miserable, not you. What you say is right. You're right. I shouldn't go then? Look... You are my son. Okay? Nothing will be the same from now on. Forgive me. Okay, son? I really needed to call you "dad". Call me "dad", son. I don't deserve it, but call me "dad". I don't deserve it, but call me "dad". My son... My son. Let's go, come on. Come on. Then, I'm going to make my ticket open-ended, dad. What are you going to do in Antep, boy? Let's go. Why? I may go there someday. "If you'd like to call me, this is my new number. Cemal" Get him, guys! Are you okay, son? Seref, what did you do? -Boss, I didn't even touch him. -What? Why do I feel pain then? -Stand up, stand up. Come on. Come on. I don't want to miss the flight. Where is Cicek? On the balcony. Mom, why can't you stay? Oh, sweetheart... We've talked about this. You know, your grandma is sick. I have to go. -I know, but I don't want you to go. You were saying that you could stay alone. Look, Evren is here. Do as she says, okay? Don't you worry. You'll get a daily report. Don't go. Sweetheart. Come on. Come on, Evren. Hello, Cicek? I called you out of the blue, but I need to ask you something. No problem. I'm listening to you. Is your dad there? Dad... Dad is here. Where are you going? To Ayvalik. Permanently? Cemal, we talked about this before. Driver, please put them inside. No, no. I'll miss my flight. Please. There are hourly flights to Izmir. I'll get you there. You just leave them, man. Take this, leave them inside. Come on. We need to talk. -We have nothing to talk about. -I think we do. You won't lose anything. Let's talk a little. I'll take you there later. Look, I am not guilty for the thing you saw that day. You're right, I should have changed my phone number much earlier. But believe me, all of that is in the past now. The photos on your phone are not only problem. What is it? Cemal, you have a huge, complicated world that is too much for me. You also have plans to expand more if possible. I'm not the woman who can keep you company on this journey. I can't keep up with you. This city is making me feel depressed. The crowds are smothering me. I'm someone who wants to live a smaller and more modest life. You want to grow as much as I want to minimalize things. Why does this make you so scared, Yasemin? Don't you want the man you will marry... Don't you want the man you will marry... ...to be successful at his job, to build a great future for you... ...and your daughter, and to dream of all these things? Of course I do. Definitely. But you do all these things only for yourself,... ...not for your wife or child. What will I tell you if you go over the limits someday? And you will always define these limits all by yourself. I think you're exaggerating. Look, just bring your mom here. We can take care of her here. We may move somewhere outside town. You'll still be in nature. I can build a great future for you and your daughter. You don't understand. You really don't understand. Then please help me understand, Yasemin. When I married Erdal, he too had big dreams, just like you. He could not be controlled. It was impossible to tell him not to do something. He always wanted crowds around him. He wanted everybody to look at him, to be interested in him. I couldn't do it. I just couldn't do it. I couldn't keep up with him. Then, he started to find me unattractive. He said, "Your hips are big." He said, "Your breasts are sagging." He said, "You don't understand." He said, "You don't understand." He destroyed my self confidence as a woman. No matter what I did, I couldn't please him. Then, he started to gather around those people flattering him. They all said: "Bravo, Erdal, great job, Erdal." He considered me old from then on. Then, he found another woman matching his dreams, and abandoned us. Then, he abandoned her, and found another woman. He left her too, and so on. Anyways. Look, Cemal, I've been through this before. I know who you are. For me, you are as constant as two plus two always equals four. I'll have no other results when adding or multiplying you. And you will always... ...replace the past with the future for the sake of your dreams and ideals. I don't want to be that chandelier in the restaurant... ...that you didn't have the heart to change. Do you understand? I don't want to be that chandelier. I made a lot of mistakes. I admit, I made a lot of mistakes. I'm sorry. Yasemin. Now, I want a second chance from you, from my son, and from life. Look, I'm not dying my hair anymore. I just want to turn my back on the crowd in front of me. I only want people I love around me. I'm asking you to help me with this. Look. Marry me. Don't go. I don't have the strength. Maybe this is not the right time. I don't know. But I really don't have the strength. Take care of yourself. It would work. -See you. -See you. Mahmut! Come here, son. Yes, dad? -Take this. Sign it. -What is this, dad? Sign it, son. Just sign it. Well, congratulations. -Why do you congratulate me, dad? From now on, this place is yours. I've renewed the lease too. You'll be alright for a while. Here? Yes. -The whole place? -Yes. Mine? Mahmut, look, I'll cancel it! Son, believe in yourself a little. When I first came here, I didn't know anything other than cooking meatballs. You can do it too. You're my son. You can do it. Mahmut. Mahmut. Mahmut! Son! Dad, I'm sorry. I was daydreaming. Well, what about the new building? It's your resposibility now. If you need a new building in the future, you'll look for a another place. So, what are you going to do? This is the day that I killed myself. It is sometimes necessary, to be born again. I'm not sure if this death would take me to heaven or hell. But I feel a peace inside that I've never felt before. A great peace. Welcome. Welcome. -Yes, Nuran? -Yasemin, guess what I'm looking at. How should I know, Nuran? Yasemin. Wait, wait. I'll send you a photo. Mom, where did those flowers by the door come from? How would I know! Someone came and left them. He entered the garden. I saw the bastard coming right at me, and I screamed. I threw a stone and hit him on the head. He hasn't left yet, he's waiting over there. I'll call the police now. I guess your mom didn't like me. Her garden is the most important thing to her. She even keeps stones in her pocket to chase off cats. Does it hurt? -No. It's a beautiful place. I thank you on behalf of the association. Really. The girls called today. Thank you so much. What are you doing here? -I've just moved here. -What? You moved? Yes. We're neighbors now. I think that I'll grow old here. But the thing is, I don't really know the town. I need someone to show me around. Yesterday, I went out, and I had a hard time finding my way back home. Okay, I can give you a tour, but I'll ask you for a guide fee. If we agree on the fee, it's okay for me. But I don't have any money. What? You don't have money? I left everything to Mahmut, and came here. That's what happened. -Well, what are you going to do here? -I don't know, actually. Things. In the Loving Memory of Meral Okay
