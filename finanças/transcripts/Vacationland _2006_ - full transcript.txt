(soft music) (soft music) - [Joe] You grow up fast in the Capehart projects in Bangor, Maine. There was always some new terror happening close by. A woman smothering her baby because she thought it was the Anti-Christ, maybe she was right, who are we to judge. It wouldn't surprise me if the anti-Christ were born here, or Christ, for that matter. There was the guy who burned down his apartment because his family wouldn't let him watch his favorite Christmas special, which of course is the only logical thing to do. And then there was the woman who killed her husband and cut him into 15 pieces- "just to make sure." There was the woman who lived next door who was found sitting in her car naked with her throat slit ear to ear and her hands on the wheel, her eyes wide open, and now this. You're late. - Fuck you, you're late. - I know. - Did you bludgeon mom to death with the phone. - No. - Too bad. - You're never going to believe what really happened. So this guy is pounding on our door, he's practically ripping it off the hinges trying get in. Of course mom doesn't hear it, she never does. So I get up, answer the door, this guy is standing there, his face is all messed up. Apparently he shot his wife with a shotgun and then he felt so bad he turned it on himself but he sort of missed. Anyway, he mumbled something about wanting to use our phone so I let him. - You're so full of shit. (laughing) - No really, I even have the gun. Anyway mom woke up and freaked out and said I had to go buy her a new phone. I should really get in. (soft music) (door clicking) (footsteps thudding) (pants zipping) (urinal flushing) (soft music) - Hey. - Hey. - Come on. - What? What's that? - A jacket. - Hey, do me a favor? - What? - Get me a phone? - Okay, what kind? - A nice one. - Sure, cool. (Joe sighing) (upbeat music) Get in. (both laughing) (both laughing) Were you scared waiting for me? - [Joe] A little. Why do you take all this shit? - Because I can. - Where is my phone? Nice. - [Andrew] So you got a bag for this shit? - [Joe] Yeah. - This is wicked cool. You like it? - Yeah. - It fits me pretty well I think. I didn't even check the size. You want any of this crap? - I don't know. - Here, have a toothbrush. - Thanks. Just what I always wanted. - Brushing is important remember that. I need a cigarette. - Thanks. - No problem. Here check this out. A fake ID. - Nice. - It's good right? - Yeah, it looks real. - I made it last night. Check out the back. I'm getting a lot better right? - Yeah, it looks good. - You want to try it out? (soft electronic music) - Hello, I'm calling about your ad in the paper. - [Victor] Terrific, have you ever modeled before? - Um, not officially. - [Victor] Good answer. How old are you. - 18. - You're sure? - Yeah. - [Victor] Okay, because I don't want any trouble, you understand. - No, okay. - I will see you at 3:30. - What should I- Oh shit. - Hey, you got any money? - Damn it, you scared the shit out of me. - Sorry, forgot all about the money, not used to paying for shit. - How much you need? - 25. - Fuck. - I'll pay you back, okay? - [Joe] The first time Andrew got drunk we were freshmen and my sister and his brother were juniors. They were going out and we went to a party with them. I had been drinking for a while, being Theresa's brother and all, but it was Andrew's first time. He drank so much so fast and then he started throwing up. Right then I fell in love. A year later, right before their graduation, Andrew's brother died in one of those freak accidents. He was under his car fixing it when it came off the jack and the front right wheel just rolled over his head. Andrew and I have, we've been friends forever and all but we've never been as close as that night. (soft music) (whistle blowing) (whistle blowing) - Fuck. - That's not what the "F" stands for, Andrew. - Shit. - In French please Kris. - Merde? - You could try a little harder next time, Joe. - Merci beaucoup. (woman laughing) - Look over chapter seven for tomorrow and have a nice day. - Mr. LaBlanc, is there any way I can take the test over again. I really need to pass your class. - I want to help you, Joe, I really do but that just wouldn't be fair, now would it? I know it's difficult and you have such potential. You need to think about your future. If only you just applied yourself just a little bit harder. Maybe then it wouldn't be so difficult for you and you would get a better grade. (soft music) - Hello? Hello? Victor? Hello? Victor? - Jacques, when did you get out of prison? - [Joe] No, I'm sorry my name is Joe. I talked to you on the phone. - Oh yes, yes, Joe. I must have just dozed off. What time is it please? - It's 3:30. - Thank you. - Thank you. Would you mind terribly helping me up? Just get the feet on the floor and then I will be fine. - [Joe] Sure. - Thank you, Joe. So I see you have tattoos. Why don't you tell me about them. - Yeah, my mom was dating this tattoo artist. So I let him give me a few. He thought it made me look more manly. I don't know what happened to him though. My mom goes through men so fast, like cartons of cigarettes. She smokes like a chimney. I think me might have ended up in jail, kind of like your friend, Jacques? - Yes. Tell me more about yourself. - Really? What kind of stuff do you want to know. - Anything, everything. - Well, obviously I live with my mom and my crazy sister. I'm in high school, it's my last year. Art is my favorite class. I'm in the drama club. I'm only flunking one class, French two. I hate French. It's the worst. I'm not really into sports but if you're gonna be into art and drama you have to play a sport. So I am on the track team, the cross country team and the swim team. I thought I might want to play football once but I tried out but there was just to many rules, it was way to strict for me. Then I thought I wanted to play basketball too, but as you can probably tell I was a little to short for that. So I didn't make the team which is just as well. It gave me more time to work on my drawings. - [Victor] So you think you want to be an artist? - I think so, I going to apply to art school. - [Victor] Well, I'll tell you. Someone once asked a famous artist, "Sir should I be an artist?" and the famous answer was "If you have to ask you shouldn't." You want to be an artist, try. - Anything to get me out of here. - [Victor] Is it that bad? - Bad enough. - Actually if I work on this drawing long enough, it will really be a piece of crap. Right now it's on it's way though. It's so sad, I used to be able to draw so nicely. Jacques has, should we say, moved on. He used to take care of me, the position is open. You could live here, I'd look after you and you'd look after me. Does that interest you? - I'll at least think about it. Maybe. (upbeat electronic music) - Hey man, have you got any money? - Fuck off. - Calm down, I'm just practicing. I'm getting out of here soon too, you know. - Yeah, where are you going this time? - Los Angeles baby, don't wait up. - What about mom? - What about her? - Someone's gotta take care of her. - She's got what's his name, Ben? Oh, and you freaking liar, she told me a bout how Ben beat her with the phone when she was trying to order Chinese. - I told her not to order from that place anymore. Put it back. - Can I borrow it? Please? - Fine. - Thank you, don't look. Hey can I use the car? - No, I need it. - It's not even yours. - So. - He's not coming back, you know. He's another one that'll end up dead or in jail. - What? - Ben, the fucker, and mom's in there passed out on the couch. It's pathetic. I can't believe you are getting out of here before I am. - So go. - I'm going to. As soon as I get the money, I'm gone, taking off, out of here. - [Joe] Uh-huh. - [Theresa] Then you will really miss me. - What the heck is going on? - [Theresa] Don't ask me, he doesn't tell me anything. - How's the phone? - It's a phone. Don't change the subject. Where are you going? - I got a new job, it's kind of a live in thing. - I don't like the sounds of that. - Hi, Mrs. V, how you doing? - Hey, how is your mom? - The same. - Are you in on this "job" of his? - I don't know, am I? - No one knows anything, all right I'm going to go pass out on the couch. If I don't wake up throw a sheet over me and call the coroner. - I already programmed it on the speed dial. - You're a real comedian. - Put them in the back seat? - [Joe] Yes, that's fine. - I told Mandy she could come by tonight. I hope you don't mind. - I guess not. - She invited Kris too. - [Joe] I guess Victor won't mind. - Jesus Christ, what is he your mom now? - Fuck off. Get in. Have you and Mandy done it yet? - Yeah, of course. - Really? How much? A lot? - [Andrew] No. - What do you mean no? - I mean no, we haven't done it. Why? Did you and Kris? - No, no, I was just wondering. - I mean I could, but I don't know, don't tell anyone this shit, okay. - All right. Do you remember the first time you got drunk? - Yeah. - [Joe] Andrew and Mandy have been going out forever, well maybe a year but it seems like forever. I hate her, no that's not fair, she's okay, sort of smart, sort of rich, sort of perfect. I just wish she would go away, move out of town, fall off a cliff, get hit by a car, slip and break her neck, choke on a broken bone. - Do you want to dance? - No, I'm okay. - Did you see that woman in the supermarket today with one leg? - Yeah, really sad. - I bet she has a lot of sex. - Do you want another? - [Joe] Yeah. (upbeat music) - What are you doing? - Shhhh. Don't wake him up. - What is it? - Trust me. - Thanks. (both laughing) - Want to fuck me? - Sure, okay. - Let me finish my beer first. (soft music) - I think I'm going to be sick. I'm okay. You still gonna fuck me? - It's late, I think I should be getting you guys home. (Andrew groaning) You okay. - Yeah, just fucking hung-over. How about you? - I'm good. - What time is it? - I not sure, but we are almost at your house. - What the fuck happened? - I don't know. (soft music) - [Andrew] Hey. - Hey, what are you doing here? - Oh, just um, here, here's the 20 bucks I owe you from the beer the other night. - You owe me 25. - So now I owe you five. - No, really just forget it. - No, here take it. - You came all the way over here just for that? You could have given it to me at school. - [Andrew] I was in the neighborhood. I just wanted to say hi. - Hi. - [Andrew] You going to the game tonight? - Of course. - I mean there is this party and afterwards and everyone is going to go. - Yeah. - Great. (soft music) - Hi, Mr. LaBlanc. - What are you doing here? What if someone comes in? - Shhhh. I need to talk to you. - All right, let's go somewhere and talk, just not here. - Why? I like it here. - Joe, someone could come in here at any second. - I need a recommendation for school. - Joe, you don't need to do this to get a recommendation. I will write you one. - I also need to pass your class. - Is that what this is about? Jesus Christ, okay, okay. - No, I mean I need a really, really good recommendation. - Shit. - En Francais. (pants zipping) (urinal flushing) I'll see you at school. - [Cheerleaders] We are the best, BHS, we are the best. BHS, we are the best. BHS, we are the best. - Hey. - Hey. - Great game, huh? - Great game? We got creamed. - Yeah, but it was still a good game. - You're so strange sometimes. - Stop. - What the hell, why not? - Not here okay, not right now. - Listen, I'm sick and tired of waiting. - No. - That's it. Kris was right, you're a fag. - What? - It's true. I can see it in your face. - Shut up. - I'm such an idiot. I should have taken Kris, at least she puts out. - Shut up! - Do you think that this will prove that you aren't a fag or that you are one? Oh no, you're not going anywhere. We need to talk. - Okay. - Listen, I don't care that you're a fag. - Stop saying that, okay? - Okay, whatever, that you are that way. I'm relieved in a way, I was never really that into you anyway, but you see, I am head cheerleader and you the football star and so we have certain obligations. We need people to look up to us, we have clout, and I'm not gonna let you fuck that all up. - What are you talking about? - Listen, I don't care about you and Joe. We, you and I, have to keep going out. You owe that to me and to yourself. If anyone found out about Joe and you. - How would they find out. - If I had to destroy you I would, don't doubt that. But I don't have to, if you just play along. - I don't know. - You have to keep going out with me and making out with me, I don't want you to have sex with me, but you do have to let everyone know that we are doing it all the time. - Okay. - Don't fuck it up. Come on. - Are you jealous? - Huh? What are you talking about? - It's okay, you can trust me, I won't tell anyone. - Yeah, right. What are you talking about? - About you and Andrew. What's it like? Can I watch you guys? - No. - Come on. Come on, Kris let's go. - Go where? - Get in the car. - What did I miss? - Nothing yet. - [Kris] Come on guys, fuck. - I can't, not with you watching. - Fucking pussy, come on, Kris. - Wait. Thanks. (soft music) - Have you ever thought about doing it? - Yeah, all the time. Wait what are you talking about? - I mean, what's it all about? What's the big deal, really? - I'm not into that. - How do you know? Have you ever tried it? - I don't need to try it to know that I'm not into it. - Are you sure. (soft music) Well? - Nothing. - Me neither. - What do you think they're doing in there? - Probably eating each others asses. - [Kris] Gross, you really think so? - Yeah, have you ever tried it? - Um, no. - I think we are going to need more beer. (soft music) - [Joe] What the fuck. - What? - Don't touch my neck. - Okay. - Fine. I've never told anyone this before. When I was 10 years I worked at this furniture warehouse. One of the other boys at school told me about the job. I don't remember his name. It wasn't a hard job. All we had to do was help them load and unload some of the trucks. Our boss, this fat man used to pay us in cash. He would always tell us to be really quiet when we went in because we weren't really supposed to be there. I decided to go into work early one day, it was a Sunday. I was trying to be quiet so I snuck in and when I walked through the door, I just froze. Tim was naked. Tim, that was his name. My boss was fucking him. I just stood there and stared for what seemed like forever. My boss turned around and saw me. I wanted to run, but I couldn't. I couldn't move. My boss grabbed me by the neck with both of his hands and lifted me off the ground. I clawed at his hands. I kicked, I tried to scream, but I couldn't scream. I could barely breathe. I could see Tim get up and start to leave. When he did I looked around and realized that we weren't the only ones in the room. I know I saw at least two other men. I wanted to yell and warn Tim but nothing came out. Then it all went black. I woke up laying by the river, soaking wet. I ran back to the warehouse but everything was gone, everything. They had completely cleaned the place out. - Damn, did you ever see Tim again? - Don't worry, none of that really happened. I just made it all up. My uncle just used to tickle me on my neck a lot when I was a kid and I hated it. (Andrew scoffing) Really, though just don't touch my neck, okay? - Okay. - Fucker. (Andrew laughing) - What happened? - I don't know. - Did we do it? - I don't think so. - I think we did. I think we fucked. - We have our clothes on, we didn't fuck. - How do you know? We could have taken our clothes off, fucked, and then put them back on. - Fine, come on, let's get out of here. (soft music) (door clicking) - [Joe] No wait, don't get dressed yet. - Yeah, what do you have in mind? - Can I draw you? - Okay. How's this? - [Joe] Just relax, okay, be natural. - Fine. - [Joe] Stop moving. - What is this for anyway? - It's for my application. - [Andrew] What application? - I think I want to apply to art school. (Andrew laughing) Don't make fun of me. What are you going to do? - I don't know, probably go to UMO and studying engineering or something. - Don't you ever want to get out of here? - I hadn't really thought about it. (soft music) - Morning, Victor. - Joe, I'm not moving to well today. Would you mind terribly going to the store for me? - [Joe] No problem at all. - Okay here is the list, here is the money, that should be enough. - Thank you. - Ah yes, taking pills reminds me that death would not be the least bit unwelcome just these days. - Don't talk like that. - There is a lovely one, it's not this one, but there is a lovely one called Anitriptiline. Take one a day and your stress and problems go away. Take 20 and you haven't got any stress or problems ever again. It's a lovely thought. The thing that frightens me the very most is not pain because painkillers take care of that. It's losing yourself, losing the pieces as they fall off one by one. As your memory goes, your body goes. That is what makes death nice. But you are too young to understand that. - It can't be that bad. - Oh, yes it can. - I should get going. - Uh-huh. (soft music) - [Theresa] I can't believe it. - What? - I slack off all day here, doing everything I can to get fired, I'm rude, I'm obnoxious, I'm careless with money. I have questionable shortages all the time, right? - Yeah, so you are the ideal employee and he fired you? - He's promoting me. - What? You're joking right? - It's pathetic. Me, assistant manager. Do you know that I've been here longer than anyone. Fuck, I've been here longer than he has. It's ridiculous. I can't take it. I mean it. I'm going to get the money together somehow and I'm going to go to LA. - Yeah, sure. What's with all the bags? - It's my fucking parents, they know about everything. Let's get the fuck out of here. - Shit. - I want to come. - [Joe] No, you stay here. Go back to work and cover for me. - Fine. Thanks for nothing. - Sorry. - Where are we going? - Just keep driving. - What about school? - Fuck school. - [Joe] Fine, fuck school, fuck work. - Yeah, fuck it. - Just drop out? End up like your brother. (percussive music) I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. - Don't apologize. When I was a kid everyone was always comparing me to him. "Why can't you be more like your brother?" He loved that and I hated him for it. When he died, to be completely honest, I was glad. But then with him dead, he really could do no wrong. He became like this saint or something to my parents and how could I possibly compare to that? Maybe he's better off, maybe I would be better off. - No, don't give me that self-pitying bullshit because you have no idea how good you have it. - You're right, I was just kidding. What do you want to do? - I don't know, let's just go back. - I don't think I'm gonna make it. - We can leave this place together. I don't care what they think. They're never going to amount to anything. - What are you talking about? It's my parents. They found all my stolen shit. - Oh. It's okay, you can just stay with me. - (scoffing) Forget it, Joe. - It's gonna be fine. (dramatic music) - Hey. Can I bum a cigarette from you? - No. - Hey. - [Tim] How did you find me down here? - I followed you. It's freezing. - You all right? - Yeah. (soft music) Chill out. Stop. - What the fuck, man? What? Why did you fucking follow me out here then? Faggot! (soft music) - Mr. LaBlanc. - One second. - I was just wondering if you had my recommendation. - There you are. - Thanks. (soft music) - One way to LA please. - The next flight is at 6:35 a.m. connecting in Boston. - 6:35? Jesus, there's nothing earlier? - No. - Okay. That's my plane. - When do you want to return? - No, I said "one way". As in never coming back to Maine. - Okay, but it's less expensive if you get a round trip ticket. - I know but like I said, I'm not coming back. - Okay, I'll put you down for a return flight Thursday and you can just tear that ticket up. - Thank you. Thank you very much for caring. - [Woman] You need 57 more dollars. - What? Shit. Let me check. Can't you give me a break? - No, there is nothing I can do, it's all in the computer. I need 57 dollars more. - All right. 6:35 a.m. right? - That's right. 6:35. - Hold the ticket. I'll be back. I am going to be on that plane. (soft electronic music) - Hey. What are you doing here? - [Andrew] It's a fake ID. I made it for you. - Thanks. - I want to use it tonight, at the Styxx. - Really, what's that? - It's the only gay bar in Bangor. Don't play stupid with me, I know you wait in the parking lot looking for action. - Fuck off. - I'm serious. I want to go. I want to see what it's like. - Okay. (soft music) - Could I get a beer please. - [Bartender] Sure can I see your ID please. - Hold on. - [Bartender] You want another gin and tonic? - Yeah sure. Can I buy you a drink? - Sure. I'll have a banger instead. - Sure, no problem. - Thanks. - Thank you. - [Bill] Want to go back to my place? - Sure. (soft music) - [Man] ID. Thanks. - I'm gonna get a beer. You want something? - [Joe] Yes, I want a beer. - Two beers, no wait, make that three. What? (soft electronic music) (soft music) (eerie ambient music) (upbeat dance music) - I have to go take a piss. - Hurry the hell up. - All right. - Can I get a beer? (upbeat dance music) - Hey buy me a drink? - Do I know you? - You fuck, you are one of those footballers that beat me up last week. - Listen, I'm sorry I don't know how to explain but it wasn't me. - Yeah, yeah, whatever how much money have you got? - Listen, I didn't do anything. - You would have to pay me to have sex with you so you got to pay to beat me up. Better than nothing. Come here. Come here. Give me a kiss. Come on. (Andrew grunting) Don't mention it. Tomorrow, when all your little friends at school ask how the football star got a black eye tell them that faggot gave it to you when you tried to give him a kiss. Vodka Collins. He's buying. - And two beers. (upbeat dance music) (dramatic music) - Do you recognize me? - Yeah, you're the guy from upstairs at the club. - Where are we going? - Where do you want to go? - My friends are upstairs. - Yeah? Well we can go back upstairs or we can stay here. - You really don't recognize me? - Should I? - You just look really familiar. - Yeah well it's a small fucking world. - Got any money? - [Richard] How much do you want? - 100. - Yeah maybe you better go back upstairs and see your friends. - Okay, 50? 40? - I'll give you 20, and if you can get it hard I'll give you 20 more. Ouch, fuck. - Sorry- - Shit. - I slipped. - [Richard] What's wrong with you, mother fucker? Where are you going? - I'm going to go find my friends. Here is your 20 bucks. - [Richard] Get the fuck out of here. Hey Tim. Let's get the fuck out of here. (dramatic electronic music) - Where the hell were you? - Do you remember that boss I had when I was a kid? I told you I worked at that furniture warehouse when I was 10 years old. He was here tonight. - I thought you made all that up. - No, that really happened. C'mon I want to get out of here. - Okay 6:35 a.m. to Los Angeles. - Gate 3B boarding in 20 minutes. - Thank you. - Hold on. Here's your change. - Thank you. - [Woman] Have a pleasant flight. - Yeah, I will have a pleasant life too. - You did it, you really did it. Good for you. (upbeat music) - Joe. What is that? - What? - On the TV. - It's just my crazy sister. (Joe sighing) - What's that? - Nothing. You're drinking a beer already? - I'm hung over. I should be going. - Yeah. - Victor, take a look at this. - What is it, Joe? - An acceptance letter. I got into the Rhode Island School of Design. - Congratulations Joseph, I really do mean that. - Thank you. I couldn't have done it without you. I don't know how I am going to pay for it yet but I'll figure it out. - We will find a way, Joe. Don't you worry. - Ken, with Theresa gone and all, I was wondering if maybe I could take over her job? - What do you know about Theresa taking off? - I don't know, she didn't tell me anything. She just took off. I am her brother, remember. - She didn't tell you anything? - No, like I said, I'm her brother, remember? She doesn't tell me anything. Why? What is there to tell? - Nothing. - Well, I was wondering with her gone and all, if I could get some more hours, maybe take over her job? - Sure. Why not? - Who is going to be our first contestant? Come on guys, somebody come up. (crowd cheering) (upbeat dance music) (crowd cheering) - What the fuck are you looking at? (crowd cheering) - [Sandy] Get up there and shake your groove thing. Come on guys there has got to be someone out there. Anybody want to get up and sing, shake, dance do whatever you want to do we don't care, anybody? (upbeat dance music) I think we have a winner. (crowd cheering) - [Sandy] Make sure it's all there. What's wrong with you? - Nothing, I'm just looking for someone. - Honey don't. Just let him go. Enjoy it while it lasts. Two vodka Collins please. Because it won't, you know, last. Sure he's cute in an alcoholic and violent tendencies sort of way, my kind of guy. - No, definitely not. - If you say so, but you never know. He will just meet someone like me and he will fall in love. It will be good for a while, sure but eventually I will be too demanding or too intense and he will just explode. You will see him again but it won't be the same, because he is just not going to be there, you know. - No, you just don't know him. He's not like that. - You're right I don't but you do know one thing. He is your first true love, right? Well you will always have that, and nothing and no one is ever going to take that away from you, not even him. - Thanks. - Don't mention it. (soft music) (Andrew vomiting) (door slamming) - Andrew, Andrew. - Joe. - Where were you? You are telling me you did not see me win that go-go boy contest? Did you? - [Andrew] No, where were you? I was looking everywhere for you. - I had to work late. - I need to lie down. - You are lying down. - Oh, then I need to get up. - Give me your hand. You all right? - I'm sorry I missed it. - It's all right. - I love you. - I love you too. You jerk. - No. - What? - I've got puke breathe. - I don't care. (man screaming) Oh my god, we need to go come on. - No. - Stay here. - What? - Stay here. - Hold me. - Joe! - Wait. I said no, you fuck. (Tim grunting) Look at me. Don't you remember me? Tim, Tim. - What the fuck are you talking about? - It's me Joe, remember? What happened to you? - Fuck off. - No, wait. Wait. (engine revving) - [Andrew] Let's get the fuck out of here. Come on. Come on. (dramatic music) (door clicking) - Joe, Joe? - Yeah. - I can tell I can't move very well today. Would you mind filling this prescription. - Sure. - You are softer than I thought you would be. - Is that good thing or bad thing? - Oh it's neither a good thing nor bad thing, it is just a thing. - Okay. - Joe, could I have just one kiss? - Sure. - Thank you, Joe. - You have a phone call, make it quick. - Okay. Hello? - Oh my god, Joe what took you so long, man? It's me Theresa. Your sister? Your only sister! - Where are you, you whack job? - Was that Ken who answered the phone? - Yeah, he was so pissed at you, did you really take all that money? - Yeah, I told him it was mom on the phone though. I think he noticed it was me. - Speaking of mom. Did you hear about her and Ben? - No, how would I? Fugitive here remember. - [Joe] Well he's gone. - Surprise, surprise, right? - Really, where are you? - I'm in LA! Can you believe it? I just did it. I just got the money and I went to the airport and got a ticket. It was amazing. - Really? What's it like? Where are you staying? - It's great, I'm staying with this guy at the moment, it's right by the beach. He's kind of older but it's cool because I don't have to do anything for it so you don't worry about that or anything. - That's cool. Hey listen I got into RISD. - You did? God, that's great! What is that? - It's that art school that I applied too. I don't really have the money for it yet but I'm working on it. - Yeah I was wondering if maybe you could loan me a few bucks? - Not really. I'm sorry. - Because I got all these things lined up. I just need some money to tide me over until everything falls into place, you know. - Have you tried calling mom yet? - Yeah, whatever, it's cool, you don't have to worry about it. - What about that guy your staying with? Can't you ask him? - You know what? Someone has got to use the phone. I have to go but I will definitely give you a call when I can, okay. - Wait Theresa, Theresa? (dramatic music) Victor? - What should we do? - I don't know yet. - We should call the police. - No, wait. I need you to help me with something first. Do you trust me? - Yeah. - You don't waste any time. - [Joe] Why bother? - I like you attitude. - Thanks, Dick. - [Richard] Nice place, is it yours? - Yeah. Do you want something a drink? - No, that's enough small talk. Show me your ass. - I need you to remember who I am. Don't you remember me? You fucked me once, when I was a kid. I worked for you, at the warehouse. Don't you remember? I need you to remember. - [Richard] I fucked a lot of boys. I don't remember you. You must not have been very memorable, you must not have been very good. - Yeah, well I've learned a lot since then. - I should hope so. - Fuck. (both grunting) - One, two, three. (Joe grunting) Come on. - No. - Come on. - No. - Come on. - No. - Come on. Joe come on. It's okay. (dramatic music) - [Victor] Dear Joe, by the time you read this I will be dead hopefully, if I'm not please give me a swift blow to the head with a hammer to finish me off. Do not feel sorry for me, I have had a full life. I am sorry to say goodbye to you Joe but I hope I am able to help you in some way. I am leaving everything to you, which I am sorry to say isn't a lot, but it should help you pay for you art school. Goodbye, Joe. (soft music) - [Joe] You would think being around so many horrible things over, and over again would make you want to hide away, afraid of the world. That you would want to escape, crawl into some protective shell, become hard, cynical and emotionally dead. But actually it had the opposite effect on me. In a strange way, it made me feel like anything was possible. You've just got to be awake, aware of everything around you. When something horrible happens, be ready for it, expect it even, and when an opportunity presents itself take advantage of it, do not hesitate for one second. (soft music)
