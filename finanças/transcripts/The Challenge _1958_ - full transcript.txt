THE CHALLENGE Hey, I'm getting off. Will you let me get some coffee? A croissant, too. - Do we have time to waste, Raffae'? Can I know where we're unloading this? - Shut up, it's my lookout. I'll get the croissant. You go tell Vito that we're here. Me? Why don't YOU go? Just because. - Better you go. No, YOU go. Tell him that we're here, if he wants to join us. If not, I don't care. Got it? - You should go then, right? Want me to repeat it? - Hey, will you move that? Move it! - We're going! See, you're getting us in trouble! Go! Vince', we're ready. - We gotta unload! - You're in good hands. Some good hands! We're forever stopping here and never unloading! Vito! Good day, Ma'am. - Good day. I must speak to your son. - He's sleeping. It's urgent. - Come up then. It's Rafeluccio. - Oh, such a good fella.. Mari', get the kids ready. Tomorrow, we've a delivery at Rosa Tea. What are we forgetting now? - Coming. - Why, aren't we working? What's this shirt doing here? - It's Vito's shirt. - Shouldn't go here! Hey, Mari', put it over there. - Hey, that's Vito's shirt. My humble apologies, I forgot. Hi! - Raffa', wait, bring this inside. Are your hands clean? - Honestly, should he put perfume on his hands? Artu', shouldn't you be working? - How can I with all this noise? Shut up, Vito's asleep! - I'm going crazy! Vito? Who is it? Who is it? - Vito, it's me Rafeluccio. What do you want? What happened? - Don't get mad! We've been waiting all night. And is it our fault they didn't show? Vito, believe me, the beach was full of policemen. They must've gotten scared. - It was you who was scared. Vito, you know it was difficult work. Armando told you. Get off of there! Don't you see you're wrinkling it? Just once I leave you alone. Fine, I was a fool to have trusted you. What's your bright idea? Pay the truck without the cigarettes? Vito, it wasn't a wasted trip. We found something: pumpkins and zucchini. Yeah, it was Gennaro's idea. On account of the strike. So we loaded up. The trip wasn't wasted. - You said "pumpkins"? Pumpkins, yes, squash. Haven't you seen them? As you know, people smoke once then they eat. Tell me just one thing. Look me in the face. Do I look like I have the face of a pumpkin seller? Answer me! Do I look like one? Don't you pay the truck regardless? Calm down and let us handle it. Why do you always get upset? I don't even want to come here! - Then don't come! Get out and say hi to Gennaro for me! Go on, sell your pumpkins. Curse me the day I trusted you! First, go find Armando. And you tell him we've got nothing! You! Because for me, a deal is a deal! And I don't play the clown! Aunt Rosa! Aunt Rosa! - What is it? How did you iron this? The collar is yellow! It's nothing, I'll fix it. - Fix it? I can't wear this! Let me see. I'll clean it right away. I'm not going to wear it like that. - I'll make you wear it. I'll fix it. Vito, gimme a smoke. - Gramps, it's bad for you. Got it? Bad. What's the big deal with just one? I knew it! That's why I wouldn't go! - Fine, you're right. Excuse me! What do you care? To stick by the rules, because we work together, right? Then, unload the truck, I'm busy! - OK, we'll unload here. Don't get sore! Then we're agreed? - Yeah, sure. I get paid whether you sell or not! - We'll sell, don't you worry! What do I do? - Shout: "50 lire a kilo fresh from the crop!" "50 lire a kilo, fresh from the crop! 50 lire" Donna Elvi', they got squash for 50 lire. Want me to get you some? 50 lire? Yesterday they were 120 lire and they were rotten. Probably a sale! - Yeah, they're selling them in the streets! Papa, you want some squash? - Hurry, ma'am or they'll be gone! Be right there! - There's a crowd! - Really? Get a few for me! Jesus, zucchini's more precious than gold! - I don't like them. How picky you are! - Aunt, for me, macaroni day and night. Day and night. Ah, there's some coffee. This is Vito's. Vito, your coffee! - Everything in this house is Vito's! The sugar's just right, eh? How much was the squash yesterday? - 120, and they were rotten. Donna Elvi', even at 1000 lire, squash is still gross. And you still got to eat it! Vi'? Bring me 2 cigars tonight! - No smoking or you die. - Hey ! Good day, Don Vi'. - Hello. Assunta! Assunta! Genna' Ah, you're here? - How much of this stuff is left? What do you care? - Don't be an idiot, answer me! Now you're interested in the squash? We got plenty. - Go tell them we're sold out. Hey! - What are you plotting? Selling for just 50 lire, eh? Go, I'll come by with the truck. Hey, cutie, trying to get yourself killed? Only 200 lire! Take advantage of it! - You must use your voice! 200 lire! Excuse me, ma'am! Hurry up! My jacket! Hurry! Hey, Vi', whatcha doing? Reading? Vicie'.. Vito, we're at 180,000 lire. Who would've thought? Farmer and truck, all paid for? - You bet, all paid. Hey, what a bundle of money! Scrub! Scrub! Shall we split it up now? - Mm.. there's no rush. See this? "The truckers' strike will end by the afternoon." "The vegetable and fruit market will be back in business once again." What can you do? We're done. - Eh, sure. The one time we get a lucky break, you tell me the last moment. What? I'm supposed to follow strikes? I don't follow politics. You should know how much squash costs at least! - What do I know? Because if the market price is normally 200 lire.. From 30 to 200, see? Ah, you think we can always sell stuff like today? Buy in the country and sell on the street corner? And you think that's easy? There are a lot of steps to take to find a place in the market. Vito! When do we split the money? There's no rush. 45.. 46. Hey, you, be careful! Even pumpkins are precious now. No worries, Sir. - Here's your 200,000 on trust. We need a strike everyday. - I'm not afraid of strikes. Don't worry, I never run out of goods. What do you need? Just give me some time to order, I'm at your call. Be well, Cavalie'. May I have a word? - Go ahead. Don Augusto! Who? Me? - Come up for a moment. You see, not out of meanness, but I don't want to do that business anymore. I'm not interested. - Don Andre', I'm only asking you to help me find a loan. I'll take care of the rest. If it goes well, I know how to handle myself and you know it. And if it goes bad, the risk is all mine, OK? - Alright. Don Andre', the stairs are a disaster. They'll make my heart stop. Come on, you know that those stairs mean good deals! You know that young man, don Augu'? - Well? - He needs 800,000 lire. What? 800,000 lire! Might as well be a million! Are you afraid of millions? Just call them lire and don't worry. What am I, a bank? What's it about? - American cigarettes. American cigarettes are dangerous. - That's my lookout. But it's my lookout too! If you go to jail, I don't care. But it's my money! Don Augu', it's me who called you up here. I vouch for him. - Alright then. Well then, the due date is in a week. A week? I'll give it all back tomorrow night right here. Bring it tomorrow then, but I still want a week's interest. OK, a week's interest. - Don Augu', nobody beats you in business! Damn it to hell! How disgusting! Who's idea was it to go to the country? The countryside! Go on, laugh, laugh, laugh! - What else should I do? The young lord drinks his egg! His young lord needs to be strong! Lap it down! - For you! - Retard! Hey! Knock it off! Now then, in conclusion: is your stuff being sold or not? It's sold and it's not. But I gave my word. I hear the same story from everyone around here: I'll tell you who you're committed with: with Salvatore Ajello. Who the hell is this Salvatore Ajello? Everybody gave him their word. What, is this man's word golden? Why don't you want to sell to me? Is my money less good? What is Ajello paying you? - Tell him! - What do you care? I told you, you'd get a good price. Good price or not, the stuff is mine. I already told you I gave my word. I'll take care of my own business. - Whatever! And if something happens, will you be on my side? - What could happen? So, you don't know a thing! - Vi', let's pay this gentleman a visit. You'll deal with him directly. - Shut up! - Go on, talk to him. Listen, is it so hard to come to an agreement? I don't understand.. Well? - It's no use insisting. Damn, you really have a hard head! Grandpa, keep the melons cool! - Didn't you hear what that boy said? You're just spitting on my money. I pay in cash. Where can you find one better than me? - I can't sell you anything. Shall I bring him to Antonio? - Yes, he'll like that. So there is somebody who hasn't given his word? - That's why he's in trouble. He'll wind up selling nothing. - I'll bring him? - Bring him to Antonio. Gervasio! Gervasio! - Hey! I'm coming! Listen, it's better we split up. I'll go another way. Everybody knows where Anto' lives. I'll wait for you there! - Let's go. Who are they? - Clients. - From Naples? - Yes, Sir. Are they traders? - Buddy, I just drive the car. Hey, don't bite my head off! These people want to buy, I told them to meet Don Salvatore Ajello. You're lucky, Don Salvatore is lunching in the country. Everyone is there because of the feast. - Go there and meet Don Salvatore. Don't listen to the rumors. - Why? - Because it's better, isn't it? If you want, I can take you there. - OK, let's go. Let's go meet this Don Salvatore Ajello. Aren't you coming? - I'll join you later when the procession starts. Today's a big feast day. Have you ever seen it? There's a procession and later fireworks. - That's all we needed! Are you traders? Don't speak to the farmers. Don Ajello will supply all you need. - Who is he? Didn't they tell you in Naples? He manages the business here. Luckily, because they'd give you waste products around here. Don Salvatore instead checks all the crop. - He'll have his benefit. Not that much, chicken feed. I know because I work for him. Don't buy from the farmers, I assure you. We're here and we're experienced. And the prices? - The year's prices. They're all set. Set by who? - Listen, speak to him. If you want to buy, you'll buy from him. The farmers only trust him. Here nobody moves a finger unless he knows about it. You see all this movement? And this is nothing. You'll see, later. Can we get a coffee? - Sure, it's very good here. We'll stop up ahead. Stop here. I'll inform Salvatore Ajello. Aren't you coming? - Nope. Let's go. Hello. - Can we have a coffee? Just a sec and we'll be ready. I wonder, why he meddles in things we don't know? The countryside ain't for us. What, and who should we deal with? They're sending us here and there and like idiots we go. Must I make the coffee myself? - Today's a feast day. - Genna', come. What will I do? - Wait. - What for? - Figure it out! Wait, the coffee! - No coffee then? Make one for me. I'm here. Where are they going? - Nowhere, just a ride - Don Salvatore is waiting. Maybe I'm wrong, but I think my boss isn't interested. Not interested in what? - This Salvatore Ajello. The coffee ready? I'm stopping here, I can't ruin the car. - Ah, you're such a pain! You're a jinx! What got ruined? Wait for us on the good road. Nothing is ruined, see? Genna'! - Yeah? Genna', the camorra runs this place. Ajello is the big cheese. He rules the place like a king. The buying and selling price is set by him. Here you can take it for peanuts, if you're smart. And you thought your pumpkins were a great deal! Never seen the countryside. I thought the prices were good for the strike. A special situation, making up to 200. - Yeah, right! They'd never tell you the starting price of the stuff here. Then there's the usual market chain: middlemen, wholesalers, retailers. How can you get in that chain? Here, it's open season. The biggest piece is here, understand? No licenses, no permits. If there's place for Salvatore Ajello, there's place for me too! Hey! - Hey, cumpa'! Good day. - Good day. Cesche told me you want to buy something. What do you need? Everything you have. Let's go inside. We'll talk better sitting down. You're from Naples? - Yeah. A nice place! What do you produce? - Anything you want. Have a seat. - Hello, Ma'am. - Hello. - Hello, Ma'am. Let's cut the chitchat. If it weren't for Ajello, who would you sell to? I'm ready to buy right away and I pay in cash. The proof is in this pudding. If we come to an agreement, tonight I'll send a truck and every day after. The risk is all mine. As for the price, I'll give you more than anybody exploiting you. Tell me we have a deal and then we'll talk. I'm in. - Good. And now the lady'll offer us a drink, right Ma'am? Don Anto', I'm the one who made the deal. I deserve a glass too. Nine', see who's out there. - I'll get the glasses. Nine'! Tell Antonio we got a message for him! Anto', Menichiello wants to talk to you. Damn, what a day: running back and forth, the dust, the flies! I don't like the countryside, I like the sea.. This wine is excellent. Gragnano, eh? - We'll take a bottle back to Naples. Good, eh ? Go and see what's happening outside. Hey, move it! Ma'am, can you give us two bottles? - So long, Cesche! Good luck. Hey, where are you going? - An emergency! - Shall we wait? - I think we'll be late. Stop! Who are they? - Salvatore Ajello's men. Maybe he forgot he already gave his word. Don't you worry, I'll remind him. I didn't come here to be conned by him! What's happening? - You come with me. You too! You're my witness, he already took my money! That's the place. - Here it is, stop. Don Genna'! - What? - What am I doing? - Wait here. Rafe'! Look who's here. - Hey, where's Antonio? You're looking for him here? - Where's Antonio? - Vito! So, you're done? And did the business go well? I need his signature and I came here to get it. - Who will? Damn you.. - Stop! Who are you? Salvatore Ajello, if you wish. Ah! You're the one I wanted to talk to. Who is this? Whatcha want? I'll tell you in a few words: Nobody messes with my business. Now then, shall we pick up where we left off? Tonight I send the trucks and you load them. What? Didn't we have an agreement? Did something change? Young man, do you mind if I go eat? - Did something change? Don Miche', once again invited to your home, I find strange people. I want to be with my friends, in peace. - I want peace too. Let's talk outside. - Why? I like it here. My stuff is already pledged. If you want to buy, go elsewhere. Now, you tell me? Why didn't you say that when you took my money? I brought the money and you took it. Now you don't want it, eh? They scared you, didn't they? You're afraid! You know what you are? You're scum just like your boss! Salvato'! Don't be foolish. Calm down. So what now? If Don Salvatore wants this, he'll have to get it from me. Let's go. - One word. Let's end like friends. - It depends on you. Antonio, you had an advance and now you want to draw back? Kid, you're being too impulsive. More manners towards my brother. You're a stranger here and don't know that Salvatore Ajello is somebody here. What do you need? His stuff? It's yours, don't worry. Consider it as if Salvatore Ajello said it himself. Holy Virgin, what a day to meet you! Good evening. - Good evening. Is Don Salvatore in? - Inside. Good evening. - Good evening. Stop filling your mouth with the name of Salvatore Ajello! How can I go down to the square and face those who know me? How will I look to everybody? - Haven't you done enough? Aren't you happy? What more do you want? - Nobody has ever insulted me like that! You want him dead, eh? Then you'll rot for 20 years in jail. If somebody acted like a big shot in your zone, what would you have done? Come in! Don't just stand there! That guy has got his truck, he's loading tonight. And you let him? - What can he do? Those trucks aren't going anywhere! As long as my name's Salvatore Ajello! - Think instead of talking! You let him load, because today being today, we have no choice. Tomorrow, do what you want. - What prices does he have? - Who cares? I'm the one who decides the prices here! - Antonio had already decided to sell. And tomorrow, it won't just be him. And you in a situation like this start shooting! Shooting? Salvato', we must outsmart our enemies. We must make them our allies, understand? If he makes a mistake later, then that's your concern. Wake up, we're heading back to Naples. My friends will keep you company. Even if you don't like it, I'm driving. - Please, my car is new, don't ruin it! I'll buy it. - We pay'll for it! - Yeah, right! And where are you going? Didn't you hear me? You stay here. Are you leaving us? - You don't get it. Do what I told you: stay here. I'll send the trucks here in a few hours. Load the trucks and be at the market at dawn. I'll wait for you there. - Wait, Vi'! And don't fall asleep! - My jacket! What is this all about? He's crazy! - No, we're crazy for staying here. Hey, kids! Kids, get off of that! Will you knock it off? - Ma'am, my compliments, a fine car. Donna Conce', did your nephew win the lottery? It seems that Vito has won more than one lottery! It's money he earned by working. My nephew is in business. Of course. It must be a big business. That car is worth 2 million at least. Good guess, Don Attilio. Don Vi', congratulations. As they saying goes.. "The early bird catches the worm". - And I get up at dawn. And you earned your millions. Kid, you're gonna break that! I'll wash up or else I can't sleep. And nobody better wake me! I'll take the kids away. - Your pants. - Put it on the chair. Give me a smoke. - Ah, here you go again! Go on, go on, beat it! Cigarettes.. cost money! Yes, freshen yourself up. I'll close the balcony. - What a lovely mama I have! Yes, rest my son, you're dead tired. With the life you lead, I don't know when you get to sleep. # Melancholy autumn.. # you are making fall all the leaves in the world.. # just for me. # He has left me forever. # What will he think, what will he do? # My love, it wasn't me, it was you! Why? # Melancholy autumn.. # you are making fall # all the leaves in the world.. # He has left me forever. # What will he think, what will he do? # My love, it wasn't me, it was you! Why? # Melancholy autumn.. Hey, Assunti'! Cover your head or you'll get burnt! I like the sun. - Is that so? Suit yourself then. Let go of me! - Come here! Where are you going? Donna Mari', Donna Mari'! I'm done, I'm leaving the keys up here. Why? Close it and give them to me when you come. - But there's people! Donna Mari', did you see my daughter leave? I saw you that time when you came to get that old lady. - Old lady? Which one? Yes, she was old and ugly. Talk about who you want, but not my daughter! That again! Ma'am, how many times must I say it? How can I make you understand? I wasn't talking to you! You're making me tired! - Don't raise your voice or use that tone with me! No need to get so sore, I was talking to Donna Maria! Have you forgotten that I, thank God, am not deaf? Maybe this time you didn't hear right! Oh, no! I hear fine! Now, repeat what you said before all! When one says something, she gotta know what she says! I was just saying what I saw. - What did you see? Go on the roof and see for yourself! - There's Assunta! See, Ma'am? - What, is my daughter not allowed to go on the terrace? I don't care, she can do what she wants! - Where were you? People are talking.. Ma, I don't care what these people say! - See, I was right! Where was your daughter? Hanging laundry on the roof? Get down, you shameless girl! Why don't you care? I want to hear you answer. Come here! Who were you with? Who? - Nobody! - Then say it to these jerks! Ma'am, watch how you speak! - Me? You dare say that to me? I better not say anymore. - Ah, no! Now is the time to speak! I saw it with my own eyes! And Don Attilio too! Now will you tell me, you hussy! - Leave her alone! "Leave her alone"? And who are you to give me orders? Don't you know she's underage? Or what people are saying? You take advantage because she has no dad! And no one stands up to you because you're a criminal! What does that one want? What do you want with my son? Clean your mouth before talking about my son! I'll send him to jail! Taking advantage of an underage girl! Underage or not, girls must be watched. And that one's a slut! Assun', don't listen to her. - I'll kill you! - Mama! Vito, don't speak to them! Don't get mixed up between mother and daughter. They'll be out to hook you all day! Vito, be careful. - Mamma, please, be quiet. You know, I may even marry her. Then, how would you look? And who'd give her to you? A no talent criminal! Wait! Before I give you my daughter.. - My son has a position! That charity case would be lucky to get him! - Who's a charity case? Who? Vito, here's the car, I'm off! - OK. Good day, Donna Assu'! You like it? - Very much. Vito! Vito! - What do you want? - Come here. This is smaller, but it's really cute. And they told me it costs less. Right? This costs less? - Sure, Ma'am. - Did you hear? No, come here. I like this one better, the view is wonderful. Here the view is good too. - No, I prefer this one, it's better. Better indeed. Just think how many windows the living room has. That's why I like it. Vito, mama is right. What do we need with such a big place? It looks like.. - .. like a house should look. It's a deal. I'll take this one. - This is the penthouse. The best and most expensive apartment in the building. That's fine by me. Yeah, but the terms are different. The method of payment as well. Here we'll put the sofa. What do you think? It really is a nice large house. I gave my word to an industrialist. That's why, regarding the installments.. - Vito! Where are you? Don't worry. - Sir, you're a trader, right? Can you tell me where your office is? - Office? He deals in country goods. Show her around. Let my mother see the house. - Yes, but who decides? Assunta? - Well? - Well what? It's a deal! How many times must I say it? We'll meet later, or I'll send someone to deal with you. Don't you worry! How much does this flat cost? Very much, Ma'am. It's the nicest in the building. This is going to be our bedroom. Are you pleased? But if the other flat on the other side was fine, I don't understand why you're fixated on this one? Well, it's getting late, I must go. Bye, Ma. But.. - Well, what shall we do? - I'm in a hurry! Ma, Vito said that this is going to be our bedroom. This is a piazza, not a bedroom! What are you going to do in this house, all alone? My son is never home. He's always out on business. The young lady told me your son was a landowner. - No, no, no. He's what you call a.. You know? Anyway, it's his decision, not mine. Polara, come on, let's have some coffee. No, thanks. We'll talk outside, getting a little air. You're becoming quite hard to see. Now, getting to talk to you is an honor. Genna', did you tell the boss about my proposal? - He told me. Well then? - I need time to think about it. Excuse me, I don't want to insist.. but where could you find a company like mine that'll buy your stuff all year round? It's a good deal. - You know very well the prices I can get. I told you. Half of the money now, half after. It's a good deal for you. Yeah, but you can work in peace. You know how I operate. Here's the stuff, here's the money. Punctual like a bank. Everybody pays me, don't worry. Well then? - Nothing doing! Cavalie', you're cunning. I should commit myself to sell to you alone, and you'd pay me only after I've delivered the stuff? Where would be my advantage? Then I can give it to whoever I like. Cavaliere Califano, a call for you. - I'm coming! Your final word? Gennari', you've nothing to say? Half of the money in advance, half after the trucks arrive. You're going fast. So, I should advance a few millions, now? I thought you were like a bank. - Cavalie', the lady's waiting! Coming! - We'll meet some other day. Some other day. I bring you business and you spit on it! - It needed a condiment. Cavalie', make your move. Half in advance. - We'll meet, we'll meet.. Hey, what are you doing? What kind of fisherman are you? - What are you? A landlubber? I'm toothless! - You're in deep trouble! Give it to me. I'll show how to kill an octopus. Kill it! Go on, hurry! Well done! - Catch! Here it is! It's genuine! Young man, don't forget, just one boil. - Don't worry sir. Hey, make me a nice plate of vermicelli. You're always hungry! For me, in oil with a little garlic. Shall we talk? I'm out of breath already. Yeah, you'll tell me after you've put it in your stomach! What else must we discuss? Vito! Come sit down too. - Coming. Smell how fresh it is. See that? He killed the octopus with a bite. He's young, and has good teeth! - And a keen hunger too! You like it here? - The air gave me thirst. - Get a glass of wine. What were you saying? - Tomatoes are in high demand this year. That's why we must be provident. - Hey, Vi'! Ain't it true you took over all the tomatoes of Taiola? Of course. I nursed a snake in my breast. I just got his leftovers. Big deal! For what I earned! When you pass by, the farmers make the sign of the cross! Here comes the octopus! One for me, boy! I wanted to bring it myself! Don Rafae'! This is a feast for the gods! - Eat up! If we wait to sell, we can sell high. We just need to stop supplying now. Stop until when? - A week's time. Ain't that right, Ferdina'? Sure, I too would wait, if I had a foreign market. The more you wait, the more you earn. To each his own.. if I may say so. What about the crop we already have? - If we must wait, and the stuff rots, what kind of bargain is it? I can't swear my guys didn't harvest yet. Against your will, they wouldn't. And if one has a deal pending? A week's delay is a lot. Ferdina', what did I tell you? Everyone wants to do things his own way. Even the Johnny Come Latelys, who've made their way with cunning. I take lessons from nobody. I work the way I like. Kid! If you're sitting here at this table, it's because I allowed it. But don't think just because you were lucky once, you can run your mouth! Are we going to squabble for so little? For just one week? If we all agree, we may even set the price at 50. No, more! - Hear that? You'll pay off your wedding! Vito, is it true you got her a diamond ring? - Yes, a magnificent one! Vito, let us see. - How much did it cost? 1,000,000. - Not even 500,000 lire. - I bought it. Gimme or you'll get it dirty. - So what's the deal? As I told you: No harvesting, no loading. We'll talk about it a week from now. I made a good offer. And you know better than me if it's convenient for your boss. He'll be getting a client who can assure his future. But I need his answer tonight. And his guarantee that the first trucks will arrive Thursday. You talk like tomatoes can be loaded just like that. We need to consider the harvest... - Genna', don't talk stupid. I know better than you about tomatoes. But this doesn't interest me. If your boss wants to deal with me, I'll choose the delivery time. I pay. I pay a lot and in cash. I don't care about anything else. - You speak well, Cavalie'. I'm sure Vito would do anything for you, but they can't harvest for another week. If your boss doesn't agree, you know I can find ten others, even among his friends, ready to guarantee me all I want. Does Polara want to be Ajello's errand boy forever? And yet I've heard that he's up to his ears in debt. So what? He has a lot on his mind. He bought a house and has to marry. Money is never enough! - And you want him to lose 2 million that he can pocket tonight? Me? Now it's my fault? Damn those tomatoes to hell! Let it go. Within a week, we'll give you a shipload of tomatoes. I'm sorry, I've my obligations. Genna', see what you can do. I'll make it worth your while. I made an offer, give me an answer. - OK. I'll take care of it. I'll do what I can. Goodbye, Cavalie'. But don't forget... The delivery by Thursday or Friday the latest. Aunt Rosa, tune the TV. This TV is a nuisance! There we go, alright? Are you satisfied? It's nice, see? Cuncetti', look! How funny, Cuncetti', look! Here, Genna'. Let him talk. I don't care. - Whatever. Nothing we can do. I told him so, but he kept insisting. It's big money. Knock it off, Vito. Are you crazy? - Assu', you don't know how crazy he is. He throws millions out the window! - What? That's right: millions out the window! - Shut your mouth! You don't know what you're talking about. Move it! - Let me see! What? - We want to watch TV! - Is this a theater? The show is over. This one is talking about things you can't understand. Go away, go on! Off to bed! Go, move it! Fine, go listen to the radio. Just leave us in peace. Go! They really like it though. - They can have it. I want to be in peace. How nice they are. This one especially. - Why, don't you like the other one? Oh, no, they're both lovely. But what do you do with two coats? What do you mean? I wear them. Watch. So? I'll go tell him it's impossible? - Again! Just so you know, Califano told me there's another guy ready. He didn't say who, but someone you know well. I don't believe it. - I do! It's a big deal and important. We'll just send 3 trucks. It won't be the end of the world, right? We can do it in secret. Who could possibly find out? And if they find out? You gotta have guts. When it's done, it's done. Evening, Donna Assu'! - Evening. - Got it? See ya, Vito. So long! Vito! Vito, are you worried? - Me? Not at all. Peppino! Tell Gennaro to come back. - I'll go back home. Wait, just a few words and he'll be glad. Califano surely promised him something. Listen, Assu', you bring me luck! It started the day I met you, a lucky day! They'll call you "Madame"! - Hands off, Vito. Behave! Well? Look at your face. Assu', wait for me outside. Go now. Donna Assunta.. Did you have second thoughts? Alright, Genna'. Let's close this deal with Califano. - You know it's risky. What? Now you're scared? I thought it took guts, eh? Donna Elvi', the priest says it's getting late and he has another wedding. What can I do? He's always late. - He's here! Oh, at last! - Finally.. He's here. Hurry up. Papa, take Assunta's arm. - Girls, come with me. Let's move. Get ready for the procession. Vincenzo, take Alfonsina's arm. Donna Elvi', you go with Don Gennaro. You gotta do what I say because the priest is waiting and we're late. Just a sec. Ferdinando and Salvatore ? - Ferdinando is in church, isn't he your best man? Come on, Vito! It's late, young man! Go on! Girls, come with me! Come in! Who is the best man? - Vito, where is Ferdinando? He must be around here. Let's wait. - I'll phone Ferdinando. Please, where's the phone? - In the sacristy. Let's begin anyway, I can't wait. Pick two witnesses. I'll be the first one. - Papa will be the second. Papa, come here and be a witness. - Vito, the rings? Vito... I love you. - I was afraid you wouldn't come. You know the groom must arrive before the bride. I've been here an hour and you don't say a word! Damn.. I see. See you right away. Where's the exit? - In the church. - No other? - No. Article 143: Matrimony imposes the reciprocal obligation of cohabitation.. of fidelity and assistance. Article 144: The husband is the head of the family. The wife assumes his civil status, takes his surname and is obliged to go with him wherever he fixes his residence. Article 145: The husband has the duty of protecting his wife, of keeping her with him, and the supplying all the necessities of life in proportion to his means. The wife must contribute to his support if he doesn't have sufficient means. Mr. Di Donato! - Taxi! Quickly! Mr. Di Donato, Vito wants you! Listen, Sir.. Congratulations! - Get ready the relatives for the photo! The close relatives, up front. Go! Why did Pasquale leave? - Who knows? - You let him get away? - Still! Try to find something out. - Still! Thank you. We're ready to proceed. - Genna'! - Yes? Get in the car with us. - No, I'll go with Raffaele in the other car. As you wish. - Genna', get news. Call me. Vito! - Yeah, yeah! Get some news, got it? Call me. What's going on? - I have no idea. How fancy this galantine is! - Careful you don't eat your mustache! Ah, how nice it was in my day when only animals ate on their feet! At weddings, I've always been served at a table like a lady. Shut up, you know nothing! - Like he knows! - It's the fashion! People eat less, standing, so they save. - The cost is still the same. Vito's mother told me this buffet cost half a million. - Really? - Really. Did you see the ring he gave her? How beautiful! It was his gift. Just the ring? He also paid for the dress. - Where'd he get all this money? He paid 2 million in advance for the apartment. Why? Ain't it easy to splurge making debts nowadays? - Good for them! My word, they'll wind up in jail! Congratulations, Ma'am! A royal reception! Give it here, I'll give it to Rosa. - OK. - Rosa, take this veil! Let's cut the cake. Where's the groom? They must cut it together, for good luck. - Where's the groom? I haven't seen him! Assunti', he's starting early to fool around! - He must be on the phone. Tell him it's urgent, very urgent. - Miss, did you tell him it was urgent? The line's not dead but there's no answer, no one is there. That's impossible, there's always people there. Miss, that's not possible, you're mistaken. Ajello, 6, 5, 5, 4. It's a full house, somebody has to be there. Try again! Again! The guests demand the groom. - Vito, you said one call! Well then? - Well then, deal with it. Call until you get someone or can find out where they are. - Vito! - Coming. It had to happen today.. Bah, who cares? Forget it, let it go! Here come the lovebirds! - Open the champagne. Here he is, get the cake! - Ah, how cute they are! It's really nice to see two newlyweds as young and beautiful like them! Congratulations! A 100 years' good luck! And many boys! Male or female, a baby is always a blessing! Assunta, I want the cake from your own hands. - Congratulations! - Hooray! A 100 years' luck! Cavalier Califano! Come, give me your cups and let's drink to the newlyweds! A glass? - We must talk. Let's go. What's going on? - The farmers won't load the trucks. They say it's not yours, but stuff already sold. - That's a lie! Polara, the truck drivers called me. The farmers told them not to load anything for you. Drink up! Drink up! We need a good song! - That's right, a good song. One at a time. - I didn't get any! - There's enough for all. - I didn't! Cut the crap, Polara, I need that stuff. You'll have it, Cavalie'. You'll have it. What's up ? - Nothing. I gotta take care of some business. I'll be right back. You crazy? Leaving now with all these people here? - Mama! What's the matter? Mama'll explain it to you. Don't worry, I'll be back. Why? Are you leaving? Where must you go? Do me a favor, don't make a fuss. Wait for me here or at home. Vito, I want to know! - Assunta.. Assunta, you haven't served the Cavaliere yet. Please, take care of him. Cavalie', rest easy that all is well. Drink to my health! Assu', take care of him! - I will. Cavaliere.. But you told me to, when Assunta came in. You told me to forget it. And anyway, if they don't want to be found, what can you do? I know where Ferdinando is now. - Let's go and not waste any time. Vito! Ferdina', look who's here. So? What's up? - What's up? You even ask? Why did you come, with a flower in the lapel? There was no need to leave your wife. We've nothing to discuss. You're through with us. - What did I do? - You know damn well. We had an agreement, you didn't honor it. You do it your way, we do it our way. What didn't I honor? What? We agreed on not harvesting. Is it my fault if they harvested? I've 10 witnesses that they had harvested when I went there. They harvested only after you ordered them to, Vito! We're older than you, you forgot? - And now, deal with Ajello! He let you work, and now he wants you out. And for me, he decided too late. Be reasonable, I swear I didn't want to. - The money is already in your pocket. Then let's split, fine by me. It was a good deal, why lose it? It was a pity. You would've done the same. Listen, Ferdina', why don't we split it? It was my intention all along. I was wrong not to tell you. I'd have told you today if you had come. Why didn't you come? You wouldn't have said anything, although now you'd be ready to trade your wife. Don't provoke me. Don't provoke me! Let's be friends. Is it possible that for a trifle..? See ya, Vito. Go back to cigarettes, the countryside isn't your thing. We'll see if it's my thing. Beware! - Beware of what? Before we were friends. I came in handy, you forgot it? - Vito! I'm not going back. We'll see who gets the stuff, me or you! - Go ahead, go! Vito Polara! Vito Polara, I wish you a long, happy life! Rafe', come with me. Gennaro, go back and tell Assunta I'm going to the country, and I'll be back tonight. You still want to go after what happened? - I must go. If I don't go now, I never will again. Get in. Vito, use your head. - Bring her to our new house. Tell my mother to act like we're leaving, so people won't talk. Got it? Vito, let's try to get there in one piece. Genna', mind Vito's luggage. - Donna Elvi', I was waiting for you. Rosa, Conce', stay here. I'm going to the station and coming back. Artu', will you hurry with those bags? - Coming. Alright, let's go, move it! - Say hi to Vito for me. - I will. He disappeared suddenly. - He had urgent business. - Good luck! Ma'am, you'll tell us how's the honeymoon? What's to tell? They're leaving by train. - Best wishes! Assunta, I'm coming. - Elvira, I'll take my daughter to the station. No, no, no, I have to greet my son. He hasn't been home for two nights. You don't need to bother. - No way, I'm going too. Come see, she looks as lovely as a queen! Come! Coming through! Let her breathe! Assu', if it weren't for me who knows when you would've married? I don't get it. These people never saw a bride! Please, have a seat. Quick! Donna Elvi', where are you? Get in. - Thank you. - You too, ma'am. Assunta, be brave. Genna', you're coming along, eh? There's enough room! Sit in the front! Goodbye, goodbye! Mr. Polara, no loading today. Everybody went away. I'll load. Let's go! What are you waiting for? Guys, let's go. This window must be closed. We gotta stay in the dark too? They're coming. I saw. Hey! Boss! Nobody's here. What'll we do? He'll see your buggy and know you're here. We parked it out back. Anto', leave it to us. The stuff is inside? Locked up in storage. Make that dumb kid shut up! Now my baby can't even cry? Tell your wife to tell them you're not here. - That's not my wife's job. You will leave this house, got it? I'll open up and give him the stuff! He's out of business. - So go tell him. What are you waiting for? - Anto'! Anto'.. Is it locked up good? Yeah, they'll break their bones. Go out and tell him. What are you waiting for? - Are you scared? Calm down. I want to live in peace, this is my house. - Shut up! Vito, let it go. Vito, listen, let's just go. Don't you understand it's not just three stinking truckloads? If I don't deliver today, I'm finished! Everybody will spit in my face! What are you guys doing there? Come and help me! Mr. Polara, we transport stuff, nothing more. Come with me! Look! They're going away. Please, the truck is new! - Out of my way! What is he doing? If you shoot, I'll call the police. Stop! Vito! - Get out! I said, "Get out!" What are you doing? You'll kill him! - It was him who wanted to kill me! And tell them that Vito Polara still has blood in his veins! Blood in my veins! It's not over! Well then? Don't you have to hurry up and load? Move it! Was it so serious that he had to leave his wedding? Donna Elvi', if he didn't go, the matter could not be settled. And he wouldn't tell me, his own mother? - What could he say, Donna Elvi'? But like that, all of a sudden? They got along so well before, they were always together. Mama! - What did he do? Donna Elvi', why then would I be so worried? - But I didn't know, I didn't understand! Did you see? Before, it was you. Now it's her who's worrying. What happened to Vito? - Nothing, he's on his way back. I called Argezza and they told me he just left. - And so? Vito has turned against all others, that's why they didn't attend the wedding. Where is Vito? Where is he? You won't tell me the truth, but I'll go to the police, and report you all! I don't care! Can't you see that I don't care! Assu', what are you saying? - I won't stay here to die! Assu', where are you going? Genna'! Genna', go after her! Don't leave her alone, please! - Donna Assu'! - Assuntina! What's happening? Donna Assu'! Donna Assu'.. Don't make me angry! Now that we know Vito is coming back! From Argezza to Naples, it takes 2 hours. Come, let's go upstairs. Then why mama was crying? - That's what I say! You know how mothers are. She's afraid he'll lose his business. If he only did! God knows how happy I'd be! I don't care about a house like this or the money! Genna', let's find a car, let's go! - Wait! Where are you going? Damn, they're going so slow! With that load, you want them to race? - Gimme a cigarette. Poor Assunta.. You think she's worried? Women are made to be worried. This very day I'll take her away. I'll be away a month with her. Hey, Vito, we're here! We're here alright. In a half hour, it'll be over. I'll deliver and get paid. You know how much? Just that you care about me! - Hey, come on! Donna Assu'! Come back! What if Vito gets home now? You said it'd take 2 hours. They must necessarily pass by here. Fine, but isn't it the same to wait here or at home? It's so cold, too. - Be patient. They must pass this way. Don't turn around. - Who are they? Nobody, but don't turn around. Do me a big favor and go home. I'll take a car and meet Vito. What's wrong? - Nothing. - Who are they? - Don't ask questions. You must go right away! No, Genna'! Let go! Who are they? What's going on? - Nothing. Nothing's going on! If you don't tell me, I'll get the police! - Wait and listen! If you love Vito, you won't get the police! - Why? What happened to Vito? Talk! - Donna Assu', Vito is there! Vito! Vito! Vito! Cavaliere Califano! Cavalie'! Polara! Your delivery is here. I told you not to worry. And indeed I was quiet, I waited. From now on, you know who to turn to. Cavalie', shall we settle now? Cavalie', you made me leave in the middle of my wedding. You were in a hurry! Boy! Cavalie', a slice of pizza ? - Thanks. Guys, have some pizza. Name? - Did you forget? Vito Polara. Boy, bring some more! Cavalie', how I love your signature! Vito! Vito! Assunta! Assuntina! - Vito Polara! Vito! Vito! Vito! My Vito! No! No! Why? No! Let go of me! Vito! No! Let go of me!
