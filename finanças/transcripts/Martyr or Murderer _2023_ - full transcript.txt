When we arrived in Hawaii, actually, none of us knew how long we were going to be there. It's hard to explain. Because, right after EDSA, we should have felt like it was over, But when I was talking to them-- mommy and daddy, my siblings-- I've come to realize that I'm not the only one feeling that way... that there's still a lot more to come. What's even more important to the question, "Why were we there?" is "How did we get there?" "Why can't we go back to the Philippines?" And "Why wasn't I by my father's side when he passed away?" If we'll say that all of this happened just because of a three to four day revolt... We'll start to doubt ourselves. Definitely there's something more. Something deeper. I pitied her, that, uh, she was still too concerned about the non-essentials. And uh, I just disregarded that. I said, "when you are living in a country... where millions are unemployed, where millions are hungry, and you still worry about the kind of makeup or the kind of hairstyle that you would like to be seen in," then it's just too bad that she never realized what her obligations were. Oh my god. I'm so sad about that thing. I never did talk to her. I never said anything about her looks. May 8th. My wife visited me early in the morning and she told me, the hospital is crawling with Metrocom cars. Guards all over the place. Maybe someone's coming to visit you. Then all of a sudden, my guards started jumping, putting their Barong Tagalog, hiding all of their guns. I said, "That's right, a VIP is coming." And then, lo and behold, the beautiful one ascended into my suite. She came, and she was really beautiful. She has not aged, and she sat down and said, "Oh, Ninoy," she said, "I'm sorry to see you like that." Mel, where are you going? I'll go meet Ninoy. He's about to pull up. He's here? - Hi Mel. - Who is he? - That's Mel Mathay. - I see. I don't know if I should be happy or annoyed. Who told you to wait for me out here? I had to because with all the events you're expected to attend, you only just showed up. You need to be picked up so you don't look like you're late. So what if I'm late? I am an important person. Noy, the frat recognizes your accomplishments with Taruc. But these days, you're better known for having the most number of absences in meetings and studies. Where are you going? What's the rush? You look tense. And you? Has your body stiffened from all the orders Magsaysay's throwing your way? That's Ninoy. Wasn't he a soldier stationed from Korea? Hi, Ninoy! What are you writing and why are you in such a hurry? Why shouldn't we hurry? What's this? Congressman will speak after the dance. Let the Master of Ceremonies enjoy his palabok. Noy! I am the Master of Ceremonies! What do you mean soldier? He's just a reporter. Imelda. It is clear that it's not just at serving the people, law making and leadership, that our esteemed advocates excel at. Beyond our patriotic zeal, we can also dance with vigor unmatched. Let's give a round of applause to the representative of this district, from Ilocos Norte, my idol, and I dare say everyone's, none other than Congressman "Apo" Ferdinand Edralin Marcos! Congressman. Congressman! Thank you very much, Mel. A round of applause for the brave gentleman from the city of Quezon, the capital of the country. Mel, the simple celebration offered by your brother in the North, yours truly, a stingy Ilocano. But no matter how stingy an Ilocano is, he is ready to sacrifice everything in the name of love. Though to this province a promise was made, by an American soldier through the words "I shall return..." I ask Leyte, as early as now, for forgiveness. Because I will never let him step foot in your land. Miss Imelda Romualdez, may I invite you to join me on the stage? In the brief moment that you weren't by my side, I felt myself grow weak. Rumors have been going around, and plenty of unanswered questions about who-- who's the woman I admire so much. I just want to make it clear that I am not courting Imelda. [audience clamoring] Because... I do not believe in courtship. For me, it is nothing but a farce. And if I did believe in it, how could I possibly convince her that I like her when we have only known each other for eleven days? He said eleven days. Do you believe... in 'love at first sight'? I do not. A lady who does not believe in "love at first sight." A lady who does not believe in fantasies. You see? If I had tried, I would have lost. I'm not... courting Imelda because I don't want her to be a girlfriend. - Huh? - Huh? I stand before all of you, with God as my witness, and my Motherland, I hereby proclaim that this woman is the one... I wish to marry. Love me now, Imelda, and I shall court you... forever. Don't let me down in front of my friends. Leyte and Ilocos are waiting for your answer. Is Leyte ready for an Ilocano? The Philippines is ready... for you Ferdinand. Ms. Imee, let's take a stepback. You mean, all this, even Martial Law-- the intervention of America, your family's exile-- Your daddy's illness and Ninoy's assassination, all of that is because of a… - Love triangle? - Love triangle? Did you bring dime novels to Morocco or something? Your imaginations have gone wild. Do you think we're living in a movie? Aren't you? Anyone would mistake you were in a movie what with what you're wearing. Which character are you playing now? When will it all end? Maricar! Our Filipina friends. - This is Maricar, my cousin. - Hello. You came. How could I say no to my favorite cousin? Who are you with? Are you with Michael? I came here as soon as I received your message. I sent someone to pick up Michael in Hawaii. Borgy really misses his brother. Oh? Where's Borgy? Where's Tommy? Tommy doesn't want to stay here in the palace anymore. He's with Borgy at the hotel. Both father and son don't want to stay here in the palace. They don't want to be involved. Things are dire back home. It took a turn for the worse. Life's much harder. History itself will be the judge if your exile was right and just. My daddy said, history isn't done with him. Even... if his enemies want him gone that badly. What are they saying? That he ordered Ninoy's assassination. Did he not? It's been six years. 1983. That year before Ninoy was killed, tell me, didn't you hear, or see anything? Or heard whispers that someone wants to kill someone, someone will die, or plans to kill? And what about you, Imee? Did it ever cross your mind to kill, or hope that someone like him who does nothing but judge, poison other people's minds, and make your family look bad, would just drop dead? Think carefully. Maybe you'll remember something. 1983. Darling, is it really okay? Are you sure? Oh no, here they come! Here they come! Yeah, excuse me. - Ma'am, here it is. Here it is. - Hurry up! Put it on me. Hurry. Help me. Cover her. Quickly. There, cover her. There we go. Ma'am, put this on. Wait, what are we going to put in your hair? Where is your headdress, ma'am? What? Shit. Smile. - Ime. - Hi. I'm glad you made it. - Miss Lucy. - She came all the way from Hawaii. Ma'am-- Would you like a fan? You jealous bitch. Why'd you take my flower? Shut up. Want me to hit you? We are nineteen meters away from the altar. Did you know that? You had it measured? I measured it. Why? So I can tell you that those nineteen meters, are your last stretch, your last walk as a free and happy woman. Free and happy. You're too harsh, dad. You talk as if my life would be miserable with Greggy. You never know. Dad... There is still time, Irene. There's still plenty of time, dad, for Greggy and I to prove to you-- What will you prove? What will you prove to me? That you and mommy are not the only couple who struck luck in love. What your mommy and I have, that's not luck. It was drawn by fate itself. Dad, won't you let fate draw ours, too? What's meant for me. Don't you want me to be happy, Dad? I don't want-- I don't want you to get hurt. I don't want you to get used. I don't want to lose you. That's why you're here with me. So you can walk me there. So I don't get lost. So I don't lose my way. Because you'll know where to find me. Once upon a time, there was a princess, youngest among the royal children. All her life, she caused no heartache to her parents. The king and the queen. Except, when she had to leave to seek another palace. No matter how difficult it was... Her first hero, and her first love... her dad... should accompany her away, "At the gates of the new palace," the king whispered. "a troop of soldiers cannot hurt me..." "but a drop of tear from you..." "is enough to launch a war." Greggy and Irene, may this wedding serve as your reminder of your duties as children of God. Be sensitive to the needs of others, to our true priorities, to the true meaning of celebration, and place utmost value on the welfare of our brothers and sisters in need! Too much glamor for so little occasion will not be remembered by every guest. What will be left in their minds is the goodness of being of one heart. So Greggy and Irene, along with your sworn responsibility to love each other, is the duty to also love others. Live simply, plainly, free of arrogance. Do not be greedy and proud. Do not squander your wealth to the pursuit of fame and self-interest. We will never be truly happy, and blessed if others are suffering. Where did you get this priest? He's Greggy's uncle, Father Fritz Araneta. Couldn't you find a priest here in Ilocos? That's what your daughter wants. Just let it be. "Let it be"? Mom, this is a wedding. While we're planning this wedding, did he want us to check the statistics for which citizens haven't had lunch? Ime, keep your voice down. Extravagance is a sin in the eyes of God! To make merry like there's no tomorrow without making a gift to one's church and to your neighbors. May you endeavor to be exemplary Christians and turn your back against this sinful lifestyle! Shut up! What?! Stand! Stand up! Stand! Stand up! Get up! Ime. Why are you standing? You are the only one standing. Long live the newly weds? Biday? Promise, just one drop. It's coming out. Lucy, I just got in. Stop bugging me. Biday, please. It's coming out. Let me just drop it. What's the matter with you! I'm begging! For Christ's sake! I'm taking a shit, Lucy! Don't flush it. I can't keep it in much longer. I swear I'll be quick. I can't keep it in. Hold it for a sec. Let me have a go then you can go back. - Fine! You can go! I'm coming out. - Don't be so selfish! Yeah, just let me pull up my pants! I'm coming out. I swear to god! Nevermind! I did what you said. I came out! Nevermind. Because it's come out, too! Thanks to you! Why is there poop on the floor? Mommy, how did the food get spoiled? They said it's the heat. All the food from Manila got spoiled according to the doctor. I'm worried about Greggy's family. They might say something. Well, it's good we also got food poisoning. What are you talking about, Imee? We're all sick, how could you say something like that. What if we're the only ones who didn't get food poisoned, mommy? They'll say we meant to poison those other people. You know the media. If I had known the food was spoiled, I'd have served it all to that priest. Imee! - Dad! - Hey. Did you take care of Claudia? Yes, Dad. I drove her to her hotel. When it's about my husband or Greggy, Dad, you don't seem to care but when it comes to Claudia-- Because I can find no fault in Claudia. When it comes to choosing a woman, Bonget and I seem to have the same idea. Claudia is the same as your Mommy. They are both beautiful, tall, intelligent. If it were up to me, I'd have prefered... it was your wedding today. You should... invite her to stay here. Why didn't she stay here? Why stay in a hotel? She was embarrassed. She doesn't have her own bathroom in my room. Why did you ask her to stay in your room? Mommy. She could have stayed in Irene's or Imee's room. Imee's not sleeping here. Then Tommy and Borgy are checked in at the hotel. Irene won't be sleeping here either. Why do you look so down, Dad? I'm just worried about your sister. Dad, like you don't call us every hour. Want me to call Irene, Dad? Go watch over them on their honeymoon. Imee. You sound like they're far away. They're still in Pagudpud, Dad. Their flight's not till tomorrow. I don't know what's the matter with your Daddy. We just got back from a wedding, but his face says Good Friday. And with that, let's start the passion. Mom, does this still work? That works. Your Daddy and I always use that. How do you use this? Go on, Dad, sing for me, please? Ugh, stop that. Ma, what do put in here? There, put the casette tape in. Play Nonoy Zuñiga. That's ballad not modern! There we go. Bonget, there's a book of lyrics. Let me see. - There, found it. - It's number seven. Play. There we go! Dad, Mom this one's for you. Dad, sing for us. ♪ Night after night we stay together ♪ ♪ Sharing lovely moment that spell forever ♪ ♪ Day after day our love gets stronger ♪ - Look, the ceiling's starting to fall off! - ♪ Growing every minute... ♪ - You're cleaning the house. - ♪ ...that we get closer ♪ - Cobwebs are falling off the ceiling. - ♪ ...that we get closer ♪ ♪ If we ever have to say goodbye ♪ Dad, you're turn!

Hello, I'm talking to you. Imee, I'm asking you. What was your question? My question is, before Irene got married, didn't your mommy meet with Ninoy? She did. Two weeks before Irene's wedding, mommy flew to New York. That's where they met. There it is. What? Isn't that weird? Why? What do you mean 'why?' because… Your daddy would of course know about Ninoy and Aunty Meldy's past! - Why did she meet-- - They don't have a past. I mean, Ninoy courted your mom. Ninoy was still brokenhearted when Aunty Meldy got married all of a sudden. And didn't you know that what I'm about to spill also came from Cory. Come on, stop gossiping! Imee, I'll have you know that this was Cory's interview for Time's Magazine. I don't know why people ignore this because this one's big. Cory called Ninoy a "chauvinist"? I was surprised. Do you know what a 'chauvinist' is? Yes. Well, I don't, so I looked it up on the dictionary. And it says, a chauvinist is a person who has a low opinion of those who are not of his class. Cory described her husband as such. First class chauvinist. Eat up. What's taking so long? Wow, Cory. I didn’t know you could paint. Are all of this your work? I've been telling her, now that we're married, she should spend her time on more worthwhile pursuits. Like what? Like? Like cooking. Why? What are your staff for? They serve the household. But... It's the wife's duty to serve her husband. And be his partner in making a family. That's why I don't care much for the growing trend... abroad, all this "family planning" business? As you know, I come from a large family. We're seven siblings. Why would you waste God's gifts? More children means more happiness. And Cory has more kids to take care of. While we convene right here. Where? Here? Yes. In your wife's estate? Noy, isn't that too much? Our estate. According to Cory's interview with Lorna Kalaw-Tirol, she said that Ninoy is a first-class male chauvinist. She said he didn't want to admit that somehow, Cory had influenced him. Not once did he own up to a mistake especially not in front of an audience. Cory even said, it must have something to do with him being a Capampangan. That's just how they are. Until they simply agreed to split their responsibilities. Cory would not interfere with politics, and he would not interfere with raising the children. They say he never once took any of his children to school. In Nick Joaquin's book, the "Aquinos of Tarlac," that's where it says Ninoy is no interested in family planning. He wants to have many children like his family. And according to him, the wife should stay at home. Now that you've mentioned it, I remembered who Mom and Dad's wedding sponsor are... they're also the same as Ninoy's... I have a feeling that they're not happy. Cory must've felt that she's a rebound. Do you agree? Hey! I'm asking you! So, Cory's a rebound? For whom? Thank you. Thank you. Hey! Imee! What do you mean 'for whom'? Did you mean for mommy, that's why he married her? or for daddy, that's why she became president? Both? You said it, not me. It doesn't matter who said it. All I'm saying is, maybe your mommy told your daddy everything. Didn't your daddy even say anything? Why don't you come right out and say it? Didn't your daddy ever get jealous of Ninoy? Jealous? That's supposed to be the reason why he killed Ninoy? Hey, jealousy is lethal, don’t you know? It kills you and it makes you kill. Tommy? Borgy? Borgy, you're going to the desert with your mom! Mommy? ...but you went to New York weeks before he went home. Are you in any way involved on his death? No, no, no. And-- and there was no reason, what for? I like Ninoy. I knew Ninoy even before I met Marcos. What about my dreams? How can I be president of the Philippines if I don't go home? How can you be president if you're dead? I can die anytime, wherever I am! Demons haven't got maps! By demons, are you referring to me and Ferdinand? By demons, do you mean those that helped you get treatment at the Heart Center? Are those the same demons who sent you and your family to America? Who financed your operation? Who gave you your daily allowance? Are those demons so stupid or ignorant that if they wanted to kill you, when you had a heart attack and you got operated on, they wouldn't have to have lifted a finger, spend money, and waste their breath to convince an angel like you that you are not safe if you go home. Are you here to collect for those favors? Do you keep a list? So you admit it? - Admit what? - That we are helping you. Didn't I write to you? I offered you my thanks. I also expressed that I was wrong when I opposed the Philippine Heart Center. Because we didn't treat you like a stranger. And treated your heart. My heart will never heal. It must be why your gratitude is never sincere. The fact that you won't let me go home, what's that about? Because there are many real demons waiting for you. - Who? - Who? You tell me who. Who wants to kill you? Those demons pretending to be angels just so you can get what you want. Who are those people who would rather see you die than come back and have you owe us a favor? I owe you nothing! And I have nothing I need to pay for! We're not charging you. Well, you won't let me go home. That's the payment you want. You know, sometimes, I like to fool myself, I'd like to think that the reason why you don't want to send me home, is because I'm important to you. But that's not it. Because you know, that when I come back, I will beat your president. And if I die, someone will keep coming up with something new to bring you down. Dead or alive, when I come home, you will fall. That's what you're afraid of. No! If you go against Ferdinand for the sake of defeating him, you'll come home and get yourself killed to bring him down… Well, then, you don't know the meaning of victory. That's why you don't win in life. Because you only want to win if someone loses. And if until now, Filipinos are still absent in your thoughts, you might actually die without knowing what it means to have a dream. If my death is what frees the Filipinos from your grasp, if it helps them move forward from the sorrows you inflicted, then I would die with honor. And how would you do that? When you yourself can't break away from us. Not everything is about you, Imelda. Not everything is about me, Ninoy. That was fast. Ninoy. Is that why you haven't answered my letters for weeks now? Letter? Ninoy, you know you're only one among many suitors. I receive plenty of letters. In fact, when I run into or speak with someone at the park, I'd find out later on... that they're one of my suitors. All sorts of men... from every corner of the world. That's why you're getting married to a stranger from some random corner of the world. I like him. You like him? Already? You only met him days ago. Whereas I, since we were children, have known you for a long time. That's why I am certain. Certain of what? Ninoy-- It's too late to act as if you care about my feelings. Say it. Certain of what? Nothing. What is it? Tell me, what is it? Nothing. It can't be nothing. How can you be certain? I'm certain that there's nothing, Ninoy. I am certain that I feel nothing for you. Or for anyone else. Because if I did, in all that time we've known each other, with so many visits, serenades, I should have felt something. But… there is nothing. I have no feelings for you. I have no feelings for Pete. I have no feelings for the famous architect, Juan Nakpil. I feel nothing for anyone in my past. And don't bother asking why I like Ferdinand. I just... like him. The 70's are considered the Golden Era of their fraternity. Marcos is the president of their frat. Ninoy was elected senator in 1967 and lined up with the opposition. This is where the historic political rivalry in the country began. The rivalry between Macoy and Ninoy. Their last handshake took place on the golden anniversary of Upsilon in 1968. Mr. President. Madam. This way please. How are you, Mel? Please have something to eat before your speech. Mr. President, this is Mayor from Ilocos Norte. Brod. - How are you mayor? - This is our new brother. Our honorable congressmen are over here. - Mr. President. - Thank you very much. Mr, President. Thank you. - How are things? - Same to you. - Brod. - Mr. President. Good to see you. Good to see you. - Good to see you. - Mr. President, happy anniversary. - Good to see you. - Happy anniversary. - Mr. President. How are you? - I'm good! Happy Anniversary. Mr. President! You are such a lying person. You are living a lie. Excuse me, Mr. President. You can't fool me. We're not playing the same game. If... this is about my privilege speech about the Jabidah massacre, then... I already wrote to your office. I've said my apologies for dragging your name. When you confess a lie, your voice is but a whisper. When you're out to ruin someone's name, you shout. Tell the Lopezes, learn to be fair in their reports. I am not a messenger of the media. What? A messenger for the communists, then? Ninoy, you crossed a line. Nothing was confirmed, but you've issued those accusations. Now that you've been proven wrong, you should at least take back your statement in front of the media. I've said my apologies. You should be thankful. For what? If you weren't one of our brothers, I couldn't have cared less about you. You'll get what you deserve. Mel Mathay was Ninoy's classmate from kindergarten to college. He used to serve as the bridge to reconcile Ninoy and Macoy. You know what? After I got operated and got well. I experienced a lot of-- uhm, soul searching. And I really tried to assess his entire situation. Why are you putting that Marcos on a pedestal? That's Ferdinand Marcos, Noy! What does that even mean? I am Ninoy Aquino. You are Mel Mathay. So what if he's a Congressman? You will be the mayor of Quezon City, and I will be the mayor of Concepcion. He's our senior, Noy. He didn't take the girl from you. You know, - let me educate you-- - You know... learn to applaud others for their success. Because I do that for yours, Noy. I don't size you up or compare myself to you. I tell myself, one day, I, too, will achieve great things. You don't go saying things like, "you'll get what you deserve." That's not it, Noy. That's not how it should be. [Ninoy Aquino] So this is the danger. - The big danger. - [Interviewer] Mm-hm. Now I'm taking some precaution. I have my bullet-proof vest. Hoping that that would be some kind of protection. But if they hit me in the head, there's nothing we can do there. I can only be protected from here to here. You see, uh, this is... this is the latest bullet-proof vest that I would be wearing. You know, this is kevlar on top here to protect this, and then the back part on this side. But as I said, this is only good for the body. But in the head, there's nothing else we can do. I don't know what's the situation on the ground. Some problem maybe on the ground if they get maybe 20 to 30,000 people, that can be a very big problem. You have to be very ready with your hand camera because this action can become very fast. - Yes. - In a matter of three to four minutes, it could be all over, you know? And I may not be able to talk to you again after this. Dad! Dad! - Dad. - Yes? They killed Ninoy. They might point their fingers at us! Yes, Fabian already told me about it-- Dad, have you seen it, Dad? - I just haven't-- - Ninoy is dead! They'll think we did it! Dad! Dad! What? It's Ninoy! Ferdinand! Ninoy's gone! This is what I'm scared of. They'll think we did it. What happens now? Like I said, I already know. I'm sick of hearing it. I swear if I hear one more word. - I hear one more word-- - Sir! Sir. Ninoy was shot at the airport! - Maybe they'll-- - Maybe they'll what? Maybe they'll what? Maybe you want some sweet jelly dessert. I just made some. What can I do if you don't like what I made? It's good, though. It's really good! I just wanted to help keep your head cool because they'll be throwing accusations at you. Not bad at all. Oh, yeah. There we go. Miss Lucy! Miss Lucy! Miss Lucy! Miss Lucy! You think I didn't know you'd be here? You're hiding again! You always do this. Whenever there's a problem, you go hiding in here. Miss Lucy! Miss Lucy! Miss Lucy! Miss Lucy! What are you doing here? Our bosses are upstairs! Dumbfounded, they don't know what to do because Ninoy died, and everyone's accusing them. And you are here! Doing what, exactly? Fiddling about, looking up and down, here and there while I was with them, trying to comfort them. You have no soul! I expected more from you being the chief maid, that you would be showing a bit more concern for the family. In that case, I should be the chief maid, and you should be the one in my place. Have you no shame? What are you doing here? Biday... What? I am thinking. And there it is, thinking, and thinking, and thinking. What is it you're thinking about? Is it helping at all? When we should have our presence felt by the family, now that they need it the most. Are you not concerned of them, Miss Lucy? What the hell are you thinking about? Let me talk! Put that down there. - I am so disappointed, you don't-- - Come here, take a look. Are you really a maid or are you a private investigator? Quite shocking I must say. I was inundated with conspiracy theories in amongst brutal manner. From the flight details to the flying vessel itself. Even the upholstery of the airplane seats, from red to yellow. And his peculiar interview is quietly suggesting that it could be a staged suicide. Well, all suicide cases are staged, how foolish of me! But let's not delve into that. Let me get my magnifying glass. The opposition is tirelessly attempting to connect the death to the Marcos family! Madam Meldy sponsored Ninoy's hospitalization, did she not? It simply does not make sense! After enduring all this painful hullabaloos, I have arrived at a very cold list of suspects. Here, my dear, take a look. Miss Lucy, who is this? - Isn't this a relative-- - Shhh! What, why? In my hometown, they kill each other over titles of land. How about this, who is this? - Who's this? - Surprise! Surprise, Biday! Miss Lucy! Why are you whispering in my ear when it's only the two of us? Well, you're not wrong. Wait, isn't this... - This one, this one! - Wait. Miss Lucy, what the hell is my picture doing in here? Am I a suspect in Ninoy's killing? No, I placed it there to balance things out. What do you mean balance things out, Miss Lucy? Well you see, it doesn't look good with just a gap in there. - I'm not a murderer! - Hold on, wait. Don't cry, look. See how beautiful you are in that picture! Right? Oh yeah. Yeah. Wow, I look beautiful. Oh, man. Once you're done with this, I'll have it framed. Sure! Now, Biday, tell me, what are your thoughts? Thoughts? I'm having second thoughts, Miss Lucy. Ninoy's story is one about change and sacrifice. Undaunting, his willingness to sacrifice for the country is what forever changed the course of history and gave the Phillippines her freedom. Ninoy, A Martyr. REPORTER - The killing was awesome, it was also obscene. It did not square with the culture of the Filipino. It was like a hand crawling out of a slimey rock. It had an animal scream to it, a primal scream of somebody gone completely mad. It was un-Christian, and because it was un-Christian, it roused the Christian nation first, to shock, then to shame, then to quiet indignation, then to street outrage. The killing opened a huge wound across the nation's conscience. The whole Philippines is crying. The death of the hero awakens the nation. The Catholic church is asking for justice... What do you think, Dad, Mommy? What do you mean "what do I think?" REPORTER ON TV: Ninoy's death-- It's the news, it's all of them. Manila is not the Phillippines. I know, but this is what the media is telling the world, haven't you seen the other reports? I'd bet this is what they're shaping the story out to be, not just in Manila but in the whole country. They could do a city-wide funeral for all I care The cry of minority does not speak for all. So, what, we're supposed to just ignore this? That's what your Dad has been doing with Ninoy, ever since then, he's been ignoring him. Well, because Ninoy has never been a threat to me. The media and his historian-wannabe accomplices, they didn't matter! He never was a threat when he was alive. He is a threat now. It all starts with his death. They're blowing it all up to a drama fit for cinema. And now that he's gone, he's even more dangerous. Are you that afraid of the sympathy they gained, this little tug on the the heartstrings of our countrymen? Filipinos are not that naive, Imee. To cast a vote, over the death of just one man? Dad, not naive, Filipinos are kind. The nation needs to be reminded that there is a fine line between being vulnerable and being kind. I do not believe, that with Ninoy's death, and all the pieces falling perfectly for the opposition to blame me, that the people will forget the good I had done for the country, and that they will only be looking upon the things I haven't! What about you, Dad, when are you finally going to think about yourself? When are you going to focus on your health, when will you rest? When will you take medication seriously? What do you mean? You know what I'm talking about, Dad... - You want Dad to step down? - Imee... Can't you see the situation we're in, Imee? No, can't you see the whole picture? If Dad doesn't continue on his medication, we will not only lose a president-- we will be losing a father! This politics, this god-damned presidency. This is the reason, Dad, why your health is deteriorating! You are forced to show everyone that everything is fine, that you are okay, in front of other people, in front of your enemies. But how about us, the ones who stand beside you, the ones who truly care for you?! Bonget! Irene! Aren't you afraid of what Ninoy's death will bring? Mommy, what if Daddy's next? Imee, what are you talking about? The truth, Dad. I care only about you. I do not want to lose you. If I step down, who will lead in my stead? Why are you thinking about that, Dad? You are irreplaceable to us. I put the country first, Imee, before myself. Then with that, Dad, may I remind you that there's a fine line between naivety and kindness. I cannot do it without you. I can't. Biday? Biday? Biday?! Biday! I thought you were only good at singing, you play the piano as well. If Ma'am Meldy hears this, she will surely enroll you in UST's Conservatory of Music. No, I'm sure she'll get you to the Royal Academy of Music. Scratch that, this is some Juilliard-level musicianship! And that's Beethoven's Fur Elise. You are tuned in to Classical Delights. We'll be back after some reminders. What the hell, Biday. You made me look like an idiot! You press the keys as if you were really playing the piano! What do you care, Miss Lucy? Why are you here? I wanted to hear the news, watch TV, but the family's having an argument over there. So I'm looking for the radio, hand it to me. No, Miss Lucy, don't. I advise you not to do that, because... I've been listening to the news since this morning, it got to the point where I can't take it anymore. So here I am, just enjoying some tunes. Well, I'll have you know, Biday, that I am not you. No matter how Anti-Marcos the news is, I will filter it out. I am of sound mind to decide what I will listen to, and what I will not. - Give it to me. - Miss Lucy! How immature do you think I am? What? I would only like to listen to the news, find out what's latest, then I will go back upstairs. I have a high enough emotional quotient, unlike you! - Give it! - Fine, take it! He sacrificed his life... to unravel the truth across the nation. Ninoy Aquino is a martyr... who's as noble as Mother Teresa, as great as Martin Luther King, as pure as Mahatma Gandhi, an example amongst Filipinos, and is like Jesus who, who sacrificed and offered his blood and... Miss Lucy! My radio! Sons of bitches! This media! They're as over-acting as we are! They could've just said that Ninoy is without original sin! That he's the offspring to Elvis Presley and Madonna! Idiots! My radio! Talk about being immature! A fitful Marcos disowned the assassination. Predictably, he said the communists did it. Because they would shoot two birds with one stone. They would eliminate Aquino, who was responsible for some of the liquidational killings according to them. The killing might have been... might have received the blessing of the NPA, or the communist anarchy. Dad, what's with the statement you gave on TV? Didn't you have a lot of intelligence reports about Ninoy? Lower your voice, Imee, please. You're scaring the birds. Dad, they're blaming it all on you, they're making it all up! Why didn't you tell them about what Manong Johnny and General Ver dug up on this man? What are you talking about? Dad! Ninoy's statement, him being interested in the NPA and all. That is what you should've put out there! I've said in many of my writings that the National Democractic Front, especially its militant arm, the New People's Army, has been instrumental in many social changes in our country. Quiet down! The people should learn about his atrocities! Imee! So they could find out he wasn't the man they think he was. They bombed Plaza Miranda! He knows about that! Believe me Mr. President, that if you do not lift your Martial Law, bombs will be bursting in Manila. Mr. Marcos called me insane, you know what he said? He shouldn't have had his heart operated, he should've had his head operated! He did not listen to me. But I feel it was my duty so I said-- I promise I will not speak out against the Marcos regime. But national interest now dictates that I must warn Mr. Marcos for the last time. I will walk the last mile to prevent this carnage. But if Mr. Marcos will not listen, so be it. As you very well know, bombs exploded in the city. August, September and October... Is that it? You want me to tell all of them... that he made it his life's work to plan my downfall, and that he could've been murdered by the very communists he was collaborating with? And he may have planned his own death. For people to have a reason to believe in the crooked principles he's fighting for! Or do you want me to say that all of it happened because he used to court your mommy? You want me to drop that bomb in public? None of it matters now! None of it! You want me to ruin a dead man! That man lived! That man lived to destroy me! I'm not perfect, Imee. But I'm not like that! If I did that then I'm no different than him. Dad, since Martial Law until what happened to Ninoy, It hurts me to hear them call you a murderer. They are right! I really am a murderer! I am a soldier! I've killed many people. I shot and murdered people for my country! But I will never kill I will never kill to make an enemy look like a martyr! And then have people choose who to side with, with a martyr? Or with a murderer? When in fact, Filipinos do not have to choose. Because the true martyr, is one who can fight back, and return the hurtful words, retaliate! But they never did. That's a martyr. Filipinos are not stupid, Imee. Someday, they will know the real me. The martyr that kills people. That's what I remembered about 1983, Maricar, or maybe that's what I want to remember. That what matters to my daddy is his principle rather than other people's thought. That's why he thought that because he's strong, we're also strong. That we're immune to being weak. And we're always ready to face anything. He thought we were as good as hiding our feelings and what's real. After what happened, I wanted to be alone... I want the world to know what my father doesn't want to. I want to scream hoping that maybe it will ease... not the anger, but instead the love. So that I won't feel sorry for him but that is so selfish of me... to think that I'm the only ones suffering. [man screaming in the distance] Bonget! Ime! What are you doing here? I'm sorry, Ime. I just need to get it out. I feel like my heart's going to burst. Why? I can't bear hearing all the things they're saying about Daddy. I want to fight back. But daddy, and mommy, they don't want to. Claudia talked to me, too. She wants to say something to the media. She loves our family, Imee. Of course she wants to help. I told her she doesn't have to. Our parents want none of that. I'm impressed. I'm always impressed by how you stay strong. We can do this. It's going to be okay. Maricar, I can't take it anymore. I thought I can. I lied to Bonget. Maybe we really can't. Maricar, I was surprised by my father's courage. That I needed to be sent away. Which only means that he himself already gave up. After I arrived, Cory ordered the embassy closed! I haven't even done anything. I can't go back to the States because they'll force me to testify against my dad. They destroyed our houses in the Philippines, one by one. Are we ever going back? Will I ever be able to go home? If we've done something, why can't we hold the trial in the Philippines? Why are they keeping us from the court? From our countrymen? My dad has stepped down already! Our houses are gone! Even our homeland! I said-- I keep telling everyone that we can do this. But now there's no one left for me to tell that if I still can. I feel like asking everyone who's mad at us, what do they really want? Because we're left with nothing. Everything's gone. Even our family. You bastards! You monsters! You've ruined all of us! My father's powerless against you! What more do you want? What more do you want? I am exhausted! Stop! Stop! You monsters! You have taken everything from us! You ruthless monsters! You ruthless monsters! You ruthless monsters! Mommy! Mommy! That’s enough! Mommy! Mommy! That’s enough! That’s enough! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Stop crying. We can do this! Imelda Marcos was wrapping up an interview yesterday when she got the call. There was another crisis. Her husband's heart had stopped. Imelda went rushing to St. Francis hospital. There's so much to be done in all front. For your country, for your home, for your-- for your needs, your health. By the time she got to St. Francis, Ferdinand Marcos was on an internal pacemaker. His condition seemed to stabilize, raising the possibility that he would once again rally. But as the evening wore on, hope began to dim. Doctor said kidney and lung failure-- Borgy, are you hungry? Yes, mommy. What do you want to eat? I'd like to eat dinengdeng, mommy. They don't have dinengdeng here, honey. They have chicken tagine, beef-- Ah, I love your bag. Shopping first. This is so pretty. It's so pretty! - Does it look on Auntie? - It suits you, Auntie. Let's look at the other colors. Dad? Dad? Dad. I was looking for you. Like you, someday, our countrymen will look for me. They will come to understand that everything that I said and did, Is to shield our country from all the blows they shall face. Someday. They will come looking for me but... they will not find me. Listen to me, Imee. When I'm gone, they'll direct their guns at your mother. They won't stop until you're down on the floor. You will leave for America before they force you to testify against me. Watch out for yourself. Keep yourself hidden. Ask for help from our friends. You know which countries you can go to. You will take care of your siblings. Promise me. Dad, I'll stay right here. I'm not leaving. I don't need you beside me. I need you on the frontlines. Watch over my legacy. I'll always stay by your side. I'm right here. I'm not going anywhere. It was a relief that somehow I was able to rest in Morocco. I was able to confront myself even though I was detached from reality. When I got there... I cut my own hair. I severed my ties to everything... especially from the past. It somehow eases the burden, the pain, and hatred. The thing with being afar... is that you'll see the bigger picture. You will see... firsthand... the different angles. Not just on what's around you but also on what's within. To see who stayed, who left, who pretend, and who's real. You'll see very clearly. While I thought of missing my siblings... something came to mind. I feel like I'm not getting any older, because you know? When you start to grow older, you'll wish for peace... but it seems like I miss the chaos, me and my siblings share. The loudness... I miss them so much. I remember my first day in Morocco. I was walking around town... I feel strange because there are lots of birds. I can feel their freedom. But... Even though, I'm in a town filled with people. I feel like I'm trapped. I feel like... I'm starting to get numb. I'm starting to get lost. Because all my life, all I wanted was to become like my father. I want to follow his footsteps. There's this one time he teased me, telling me that I should have been a boy. Me, on the other hand, said "why didn't you made me a boy?" As time passes by while I look for my father... I suddenly realized that I've already found myself. I'm starting too see life through the eyes of my children. But at the end of the day... I'm still a child who longs for her parent's touch. To all the sons and daughters out there. Listen to me... love your parents! Because back then... when I was missing my father's embrace, his voice, I remember. There's this one time when he called me before EDSA. When I just arrived at Singapore. I was so irritable, because I was sick. Trying to get well. I didn't know he had a problem. I realized, when I was in Morocco. I'll surrender everything. I'm willing to trade everything just to hear my father's voice again. Just to hear him say... "Imee... ...come home." Is this about your dialysis? Are you okay? Come home now. Dad? We'll bring you to the palace to make a call. No. Thank you. Hello? Irene. Where's Daddy? Imee, Dad's… Irene, give the phone to dad, come on. Imee, Bonget's here. He just arrived. But while he was looking after your daddy, his heartbeat started to grow faint. The doctor said he can still hear us. Mommy, give the phone to daddy. Please. Please, give him the phone. Ferdinand, it's your eldest. Dad. Dad. Daddy. Why am I the only one who's not with you? Aren't you gonna ask me to come home? Dad, please fight a little longer. I'm not sure I can bear it. Dad. Dad, forgive me for all the wrongs I did to you. Please forgive me. Dad. Dad, sorry. Sorry, Dad. Dad, forgive me for all the wrongs I did. Dad. I love you very much. I love you very much, Dad. Daddy, I love you. I love you. Dad? Please let me hear you love me. So I have something to keep with me. Please, Dad. Daddy! Dad! Daddy! Daddy! I love you very much, Dad. I love you very much. The best maid in Malacañang. Daddy! Tell me, am I a bad person? I'm proud of you... I just don't say it. Dad! I'm Ferdinand Emmanuel Edralin Marcos! A lawyer. A soldier. And President of the Philippines. I'm thanking you all, thank you very much. For understanding our shortcomings, for forgiving... our intemperance. I love you all ...deeply. Daddy! I love you very much. I love you very much. Daddy! Good evening, ladies and gentlemen we are interrupting regular programming to bring you the latest news bulletin that former president Ferdinand E. Marcos died at 6:48PM tonight. Marcos died after slipping into a coma. He was 72 years old. The president will never leave my heart. And will never die as far as I'm concerned. He will always be there. In fact, he will be... all the time there. But when i came to Manila I had an interview with President Aquino. and I’ll never forget this I said, I can’t remember everything by word you know how can you not allow his, him to come back if he’s already deceased. What’s the big deal? You know that was my question. And she was very strong and said, basically dead or alive, if he returns, he will create a pivot in our country. and I have to be aware of that and I went oh, okay, you know. because that’s how strong Marcos was and she knew it, and she wasn't gonna, you know, she wasn't gonna make light of it, so she said basically, “No, I’m not gonna let him comeback.” Bonget. Ime. I feel that Leni cheated on us. June 30, 2022. The National Museum of Fine Arts in the city of Manila, Philippines. To administer the oath of office Chief Justice, Alexander G. Gesmundo. May we request on stage Atty. Liza Araneta-Marcos. Ferdinand Alexander Sandro Marcos, Josef Simon Marcos and William Vincent Marcos to witness the oath taking. Ladies and gentlemen!
