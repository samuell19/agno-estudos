NARRATOR: From the dawn of creation, nature's world has been a world of miracles. Yet nature, never content to rest, is constantly changing her planet and all life existing upon it. Nature works her changes in mysterious ways, sometimes in a manner beyond our understanding, yet her secrets of life are to be found everywhere. They're revealed in the very crust of the Earth itself. The vast coalfields of the globe contain fossils in endless variety, the preserved skeletons of strange species that once lived in long-forgotten swamps. Many of the world's great deserts hold within their arid wastes the shell-covered beaches of prehistoric seas where marine life flourished in ancient waters. The scarred and broken lands of the far north tell of an age when glaciers covered the top of the world and life on the Earth virtually came to a standstill. To this day, life continues its battle with nature's elements, for the physical world in which all species must exist is forever being reshaped. In nature's epic story, the Ice Age and the age of fossils are chapters from the past, yet new chapters are constantly being added to the timeless tale. And even now there are processes going on that drastically change our planet. Nature's seas, restless, insatiable, continually eat away the land on which we live and change the shapes of whole continents. Nature works the magic of change upon her broad oceans. By evaporation, she causes their waters to rise as mist and form the clouds. In ever-changing patterns, nature moves her clouds across the sky, and out of this atmospheric turmoil come her storms and her variations in the weather. All the planet is nature's workshop, and all its elements, her raw materials. Deep underground, she produces steam. From hidden sources, she draws water heated to scalding temperatures. In boiling solutions, she dissolves and blends her basic ingredients, one way of creating her rich mineral and chemical deposits. (BUBBLING) And so it is that our planet still undergoes constant remaking, even as it did in ancient times. During the morning of Earth's beginning, there came out of the void life. What life is and how it came to be remains the eternal mystery, and yet we can observe it in all its myriad forms, wonder at its complexity and marvel at the strange ways in which nature preserves it. For each of her species, nature has perfected some secret technique for survival, and this is the story of our True-Life Adventure, the story of adaptation and self-preservation, the story of nature's secrets of life. In the world of plants, nature locks the precious germ of life inside some of her smallest parcels, her tiny seeds. Here may exist the makings of a giant tree or a delicate flower, of a useless weed or a fruitful plant. Yet whichever it may be, the spark of life is vital. And nature takes infinite pains to make sure her seeds are properly planted. She equips some with tiny parachutes. The seeds of these milkweed plants will ride the wind great distances to reach a fertile planting ground. Obeying the ancient urge to propagate its kind, the cottonwood releases its parachutes by the thousands, creating with its bursting pods a springtime snowstorm. Of course, nature can't depend entirely on the wind to plant her seeds, and to some she grants the ability to sow themselves. The seed of the wild oat is one of these. During its early development, it grows in pairs, two grains to a hull, and each has a long tail called the arm. These appendages are extremely sensitive to temperature changes, and even while the seeds ripen on the stalk, they twist and turn. When the seeds fall to earth, they often stay together, and the arms become legs, since the wild oats are prepared to walk to their planting ground. Under the heat of midday, the arms bend and unbend. Like strange insects, the wild oats begin an erratic but remarkable journey. Upon reaching a favorable spot, the legs push the seeds under the soil. Thus, the wild oat is actually a self-planting plant. Another self-propagating species in nature's garden is a common weed. It's the filaree, sometimes called the heron's bill because it bears a resemblance to that long-billed bird. But this similarity is only temporary. As this seed ripens, it coils like a watch spring, winding and unwinding in response to changes in temperature and humidity. This clocklike action gives the plant another of its names, the clock. After it falls to earth, the seed continues its winding action, and soon it is literally drilling itself into the ground. At the planting season, the seeds of the witch hazel are shot out into space, sometimes to a distance of 30 feet. There's a reason for this explosive technique. It sends the seeds beyond the shade of the parent shrub. The secret ways of nature are often strange. Even the forest fire helps her with her planting. In the forest, there exist certain species of pines whose seed cones will open only at the touch of naked flame. The knobcone pine waits for this moment of emergency to release its seeds, and in so doing helps replant the wilderness almost before the holocaust has passed. And so the flames that bring destruction also bring new life. The seeds drop to earth, and out of its own ashes nature's forest will rise again. Seed and soil, a magic combination, for it awakens the dormant life spark. Deep underground, living roots push downward. In their search for nourishment, they become an irresistible force, and so-called immovable objects are ruthlessly pushed aside. The modern camera can speed up the process of growing, and it reveals that plants are forever moving, changing, struggling, forever reaching upward toward the life-giving sun. Competition for a place in the sun is the basic problem of the plant world, and every green, growing thing, from a blade of grass to the tallest tree, must fight this age-old battle. When nature has brought her growing plants to maturity, her work is only half-done. She must reproduce each species, and to do this, she must make sure that each will bear new seeds. For a wild shrub or domesticated vegetable, her goal is the same. Thus, the common corn plant must follow her prescribed pattern of development. At the proper time, a tassel appears. It might be called the plant's crowning flower. There's more than adornment here, however. This is the part of the plant that produces pollen. But it will not release the life-giving dust until just the right moment. Farther down the stalk, the budding ears appear, and at their tips, the silks. Before the plant can produce a mature ear of corn, these silks must play their part in the age-old ritual of pollination. Now, with the wind lending assistance, the tassel releases its pollen, which drifts downward to fall on the silks below. Viewed through the microscope, the secret of fertilization becomes clear. From the pollen, the germ of life travels along the silks to the individual kernels on the cob. And soon the ripening corn appears, row upon row along the ear. Each golden kernel is a new seed capable of reproducing the species. Through the miracle of pollination, nature's plant world is forever born anew. It's a miracle that occurs every spring, in fact, must occur without fail or nature's grand design is incomplete. And to make sure it happens, she turns to her insect world and calls in a host of helpers to assist in the age-old ritual. Many flowers have tricks of their own for guaranteeing pollination. The salvia blossom has an ingenious trigger that secretly rubs pollen on the unsuspecting visitor. The iris secretes nectar deep in its throat, and to reach this tempting prize, an insect must crawl over the pollen-bearing parts of the plant. Some flowers seemingly try to keep callers out, and this, of course, only makes them more impatient to get in. And so the bumblebee literally fights its way into the tightly-folded gentian. The blooms of the cactus family use a different method. They actually put their pollen-dusted arms around their insect visitor's as though urging him to stay awhile. During the daytime hours, the squash blossom holds open house. But toward evening, as the sun disappears, it closes, and often the last guest of the day is locked in. Sometimes the insect will wait for morning and the flower's reopening, but just as often, it chews its way out immediately. In any case, it's sure to leave covered with pollen. Among nature's pollen-bearers, none does greater service than the honeybee. Here is the master pollinator of the insect world. It's been said that thousands of species of plants would disappear from the Earth if the bees did not visit them. Unlike many insects that pollinate the flowers accidentally, the bee comes specifically to gather pollen. The golden dust is commonly known as bee bread, and it's a favorite food for the bee larvae. The bee has her own way of carrying this golden cargo. She simply fills the pollen baskets on her rear legs, designed for the purpose. Other bees, meanwhile, gather the nectar from which the honey is made. Yet sometimes a bee must take the bitter with the sweet, for not all flowers are friendly. Some, in fact, are deadly. One of the pitcher plants is as dangerous as its hooded appearance suggests. It's often called the cobra plant. This enemy of all bees takes its toll in a strange and unexpected way. The bee enters in its routine manner, counting this just another station on its rounds. But the inner surface of the plant is covered with sharp spines, all pointing downward. When the bee tries to leave, she finds herself in a trap. There's little room to use her wings. And finally, exhausted by her efforts, she meets her doom. In the realm of the bees, enemies are numerous, but one of the worst things that can happen is to be caught out in the rain. To a bee, a spring shower is a deluge, each raindrop a cloudburst. At a time like this, flying is out of the question. The bee has all it can do to keep from drowning. But after peril, plenty, for now the rain-filled blossoms are the bee's goblets, brimming with crystal-clear drinking water. The working day of the bees is long and strenuous, and it involves hundreds of beeline trips to the hollow tree where they live. From earliest times, the home life of the bees has continued with an undeviating sameness. In fact, the ancient Egyptians knew and honored them for the same reasons we do. And yet, in spite of our long acquaintance with their story, some of its aspects seem like a fantasy. Like most fairy tales, this one has a queen, ladies in waiting, magic potions, all the trappings of a proper fable. The queen bee is the central figure of the pageant. All life revolves around her, for without a queen, there can be no community of bees. Only she has the power to reproduce the species. And so she's a slave to her destiny, which is the practical one of producing an endless supply of eggs. In her productive span of approximately four years, she's capable of producing a million new bees. This ceaseless production becomes a constant challenge to her workers, for it's up to them to provide the so-called brood combs. And here are the eggs, the bees of the future, each cradled in its own waxen chamber. As the main building material, wax is always in demand, and how the bees manufacture it is one of their most astounding secrets. Often during the wax-making, they hang suspended in a living curtain. This is a time of waiting while some strange chemistry produces the wax inside their bodies. Soon the wax appears in the form of thin flakes squeezed from between the abdominal segments. As these fall from the wax-makers, other workers gather them up, chew them to a workable consistency and begin the construction of the combs. The delicate architecture of the bee is an amazing example of engineering to conserve space. Each cell, with its precision-made six walls, fits all other cells surrounding it, and this hexagonal structure with built-in cross-bracing assures maximum strength with a minimum of material. Every hive contains hundreds of combs, and during the spring and summer, they're packed with the foodstuffs that will carry the colony through the winter. Spring is the season for the annual gold rush, when every bee returning from the field is loaded with dust, the golden pollen from the flowers. Thrifty, frugal, the bees make every inch of storage space count. And before long, the colony's safe-deposit boxes are bulging with this natural gold. Everyone knows that bees make honey, yet no one, not even the scientist, knows exactly how they make it. In fact, mankind can't reproduce synthetically the product created in the wild. The honey-making is the work of specialists known as house bees. It's their job to wait at home and receive the nectar from the field bees. By means of evaporation, they reduce its moisture content until only the concentrated essence remains. The eventual conversion to honey is accomplished through a mysterious digestive process. And when the golden liquid is finally of the right consistency, it's sealed in the honeycombs. These are prosperous times. Now there's more than enough food to carry the colony through the winter. But with the welfare of the hive assured, there comes a time of change. The queen bee must leave this colony and establish a new one somewhere else. Thus, if anything unforeseen should happen to this hive, there will be another to perpetuate the species. This is nature's pattern for survival. And so the mass flight known as the swarming occurs. (BUZZING) Meanwhile, what's to become of the treasure they've left behind and the bees that remain? Without a queen, the old colony can't go on. Well, nature has long since taught the bees how to create a new queen, and now we're about to witness a marvel without parallel in the wild, one of nature's most astounding secrets of life. After a brief search among the ordinary brood cells, the worker bees select a half a dozen of the most recent larvae. These are the candidates for queen. And for each a royal cradle is constructed. The queen is the largest of the bees, and an aspirant for that honor must have room to grow into her position. And now the magic potion of this fairy tale. Like sorcerers with supernatural powers, the nursemaids produce a substance called royal jelly. And when this is fed to the regal babies, it works a miracle, for it makes them fertile. Upon reaching maturity, any one of them will be able to recreate the species. Finally, the queen cells are sealed up, and a period of waiting begins. The fate of the colony depends on the outcome of this mysterious ritual. At long last, the queen appears. Her first official duty is a grim one. She makes the rounds and kills her rivals, stinging them to death inside their sealed chambers. Occasionally, however, a second queen emerges before this can be done. And now there's only one way to settle the question of which shall wear the royal mantle. It's queen against queen, to the death. Unlike an ordinary bee, a queen does not lose her stinger when she attacks. She can sting again and again in this close-quarter combat. In repeated injections, bee venom is a strong poison. Soon one or the other of these battling females will succumb to its paralyzing power. The seconds at this duel take a strange stand. It must be a fight to the finish. If one queen draws away, they herd her back to battle. For the sake of the colony, only one queen can remain alive. Finally, the fatal stab. The battle ends. For the vanquished, death and discard. For the victor, life and a bridegroom, for now a royal wedding is decreed. Enter the drones. These are the lazy male bees who do no work. Yet they're necessary in nature's scheme of things, for one among them must mate with the queen bee. This occurs high in the sky, out of sight, in a ritual known as the wedding flight. Upon her return, the queen begins the production of eggs, and now the future of the hive is assured, or seems to be until circumstance decrees otherwise. Outside, a forest fire approaches. This is the worst disaster that can happen in the domain of the bees. Inside their tree, the bees are alarmed and momentarily confused, but they don't give way to panic. Every bee seems to understand what fire and heat mean, what the rising temperature can do to the fragile honeycombs. Immediately, the fanning squad goes into action. Every available bee joins the line. (BUZZING) In normal times, this is the way they evaporate the moisture from their honey. But in times of emergency like this, it's a last-ditch measure to save their home. Their common concern now is to circulate cool air throughout their storehouse. The crackling flames keep coming and the heat grows intense. In spite of the menace, the fanning squad stands its ground. Their only hope is to keep the honeycombs from melting, so they continue their frenzied efforts. But the fire has heated the surrounding atmosphere. Now there's no longer any cool air to be drawn in from the outside, and the final, fatal disaster occurs. As a last resort, the bees drink their honey. Each bee gorges itself in the hope that it can escape with some small portion of their hard-won treasure. By some odd quirk of fate, the fire passes on. The surrounding countryside is a smoking scene of devastation, yet the tree belonging to the bees has been spared. The moment they feel the drop in temperature, the bees know the crisis has passed and, quick to react, they begin the task of repairing and rebuilding. In this they display their heritage, for with the bees, as with most of her living species, nature has an unfailing ability to rebound from ruin. The honeybee is not the only honey-maker in the insect world. It has a rival in this work, a rival whose industrious habits almost outdo the busy bee. This is the hardworking creature of the subterranean kingdom existing beneath our feet. The lowly ant. It's a fact, but a little-known fact, that certain of the ants store honey. These are the honey cask ants, and they become their own storage vessels. Filled to bursting with honey, they hang from the ceiling of their underground chambers like bottles in a wine cellar. Those who accept this duty are called repletes, and the name fits them well, for these gluttons gorge on sweets until their abdomens stretch to enormous proportions. They'll never be normal again, but are destined to remain like this for the rest of their natural lives, living containers of the colony's food supply. Besides the honey-makers, there are the harvesters, the hunters, the gardeners, in fact, 5,000 species in all. And each has a highly specialized existence. In the brief span of our True-Life Adventure, we'll view only a few of these strange societies, yet each can be expected to reveal some singular secret of life. The gardeners of the ant world are the leafcutters, but it's a most unusual garden they cultivate. It grows neither fruit nor flower nor vegetable, but a secret crop that only they know how to raise. To keep it producing, these insects must collect a never-ending supply of cuttings, and the homeward trek with their odd harvest becomes a procession of prize pickings. The garden of the leafcutter ants grows deep underground. Their cuttings have been chewed to bits and glued to the ceiling of their cavern. And by now these hanging columns of vegetable matter are covered with a natural fungus growth. This is exactly the byproduct the ants want. To them, this is an appetizing and highly edible delicacy. In fact, it's their only food. It's a crop requiring almost daily care, for if the fungus is not constantly tended, other forms of mold, like so many weeds, will overrun the garden and ruin it. Yet even when the leafcutters lose out, nature, in the long run, wins, for this strange culture serves to fertilize and enrich her soils. Nature's ants serve her in a number of beneficial ways. Her hunting ants keep certain insect pests under control, and when they discover a nest of termites it's an especially lucky day. The termites rarely appear above ground. When they emerge like this, in their winged phase, it means they're starting an annual migration to form new colonies. But before they can try their new wings, the ants stage an ambush, putting an end to their plans. The hunting ants will tackle prey that most other creatures leave strictly alone, such untouchables as these ravenous blister beetles. There are many different kinds, but all seem to delight in eating the flowers in nature's garden. The blister beetle gets his name from the fact that his body contains cantharadin, a substance so corrosive it can blister the skin. For this reason, he's not generally considered a delicacy, yet these ants seem to savor him just the same. Perhaps his sharp juices add the spice to their banquet. At any rate, they fall to with a relish. Occasionally, the game in these parts is bigger than usual. The problem here is where to begin. While the ants are sizing up the situation, the grasshopper suddenly remembers some urgent business elsewhere and takes off for safer territory. Besides the hunters, there are the harvesters in nature's ant world, and a dandelion gone to seed is a favorite crop. For all their differences, the ants hold one thing in common, the ability to dig. Digging is second nature with them, and the fine art of tunneling is an accepted skill. In fact, their engineering is so exact, the ants think nothing of making tunnels meet within a fraction of an inch. The strength of these tiny creatures has always amazed mankind. Individual ants often lift rocks many times their own weight. In proportion, a human would have to carry boulders weighing a ton or more. Underground, these pebbles are a nuisance. They block off tunnels and generally get in the way. On the surface, however, they serve a more useful purpose. As they accumulate around the entrance, they're carefully sorted and placed in pattern to form an efficient drainage dike. Such is the foresight of nature's insect engineers. In the ant world, the fight for survival becomes open warfare among the various species. And the bitter rivalry between the red ants and the black ants is as old as ant history. With the black marauders at the gates of the red colony, the battle is joined. If the blacks can rout the reds, they will steal the larvae for food. But the reds anticipate this and move their nursery to distant chambers. The ants' weapons are their powerful pincers, with which they cut off each other's legs and sometimes even heads and bodies. An ant in the middle of a tug of war is in a dangerous predicament, for he can hardly hope to come out of it in one piece. Here's a fellow with three heads, his own and two belonging to rivals who lost theirs in the heat of battle. But no matter what else is missing, if an ant can work his pincer jaws, he still counts himself part of the battle. In these raids, it's sometimes the invaders who win, sometimes the defenders. But in the end, there's hardly an able-bodied fighter left on either side. Meanwhile, the black raiders have made a serious tactical blunder. Their own nest is undefended. This is an open invitation to disaster, and it's not long in arriving in the form of a small reptile called the blind snake. But he's not blind to an opportunity like this, and soon the larvae begin to disappear at an alarming rate. On their return from the wars, the ants discover the monster loose in the nursery. There's only one thing to do, attack. In a crisis like this, the ants will do battle against any odds. Their courage is amazing. Actually, this reptile is only six inches long, just about the size of an ordinary earthworm. In fact, he's sometimes called the worm snake. Yet to the ants, he's twice the size of a python. He's a true snake, too. His body is covered with overlapping scales, and it's this protective armor that creates a problem for the defenders. But if they can't cut him to ribbons, they can at least tie him in knots, and soon the snake can't decide whether he's coming or going. Finally, however, going seems the best maneuver, and so he unwinds himself into a handy hole. The frustrated home guard strings along, too, still working at the loose ends of the problem. To make sure this won't happen again, the ants slam the door on their unwelcome guest. In the insect world, the plant world, and the world of water creatures, wherever we turn in nature, we find amazing secrets of life. Of all her domains, nature's water world is the most bountiful. Here, it's said, was the starting point of life. And to this day, nature preserves creations not unlike those of the beginning. Within the boundaries of a single drop of water there lies a teeming realm that's invisible to the naked eye. Yet if we make the microscope our magic window, we may peer in on life in its most basic form, the single cell of living matter. Here, in a world we call a microcosm, live the protozoans. The name means literally "first animals." From long habit, nature moves toward complexity, and in the rotifer, she undertook some strange experiments. She gave it a mouth of a sort and a set of whirling hairs to keep floating foodstuffs coming its way. To handle this intake, she developed the rudiments of a digestive system, created a sac to hold eggs, and finally decided the rotifer should have a leg to stand on and so added a single retractable foot. Not only anatomy but habits, too, undergo change. Usually, nature assigns to the male and female separate and well-defined duties. As a rule, Father provides, Mother protects. But with the stickleback fish, nature changes these roles. It's the male who performs all the domestic chores. He initiates housekeeping by building the nest even before he's found a bride to occupy it. He uses various materials, stems of plants, reeds, moss, whatever he can find. A sturdy stick is just the thing until it gets up and walks away. This is a form of water bug that looks so much like a twig it's often taken for one. As a homemaker, the stickleback can do everything but produce the eggs. That's a function still reserved for the female. And so he goes looking for a mate. He finds her soon enough, but it takes some coaxing to get her interested in his new love nest. Looks like he's picked a fickle stickleback, for sure. She doesn't seem to be satisfied with anything, its location, the size of the rooms, the whole arrangement in general. Rather than argue, the hopeful husband pitches in and does some quick remodeling. Apparently, that took care of most of her objections, for now, she deposits her eggs inside. The impatient male nudges her to help the process along. And then it's his duty to supply a substance known as milt that will fertilize the eggs. For some unknown reason, the female will devour her own eggs unless the male fish chases her away. And so the honeymoon ends almost before it starts. A nosy salamander seems to have a taste for fish eggs, too. And just in time, frantic Papa Stickleback shows him the nearest exit. But Father's vigilant care of the eggs is only the beginning. When the new generation hatches out, his hectic days really start. Like most small fry, baby sticklebacks have a strong desire to run away from home. Well, there's only one way to handle these tiny truants. Catch them in your mouth, carry them home and spit them back into the nest. These are dangerous waters, and the predator most feared is the dragonfly in his so-called nymph stage of development. Most fish eat insects, but here's an insect that eats fish and practically everything else. He'll attack anything that comes within reach, and it's his reach that's deceiving, for it's this hinged and extendible food catcher that makes him deadly. One moment he seems to be sleeping, and the next he's got you. While he's passing through the nymph stage, this voracious hunter is a menace to all life that comes his way. But protection comes only to those that achieve it for themselves. The diving spider, for example, creates a strange diving bell. The spider's actually an air-breathing species, and to exist down here, she must have an oxygen supply. And so she makes trip after trip to the surface, each time gathering another bubble of air. She captures it with her hairy legs, and down below, she adds it to the growing air chamber that is to be her home. This odd airlock is kept from floating away by the silken strands of her web, which anchor it to the surrounding foliage. Sometimes she gets careless and bobbles the bubble. Oops! Bubble fingers. When her work is finally done, this unique hideout means shelter and safety for herself and her young. Among nature's fish, the problems of survival dictate some strange adaptations. This one bags his dinner with a silver bullet, a drop of water he expels from his mouth. While there are many fish that can leap from the water to catch insects in midair, only the archer fish can shoot them down like this, and it's his talent for target shooting that gives him his name. Actually, this is a most remarkable accomplishment. The fish must aim from a submerged position, which means he sees his target distorted by water. Yet in spite of this seeming handicap, he manages to score one bull's-eye after another. In the art of fancy shooting, here's a marksman without a match. Nature's greatest water world, of course, is the sea, for three-fourths of our globe is covered with ocean, a vast body of water that has never been fully explored. The sea is nature's ancient cradle of creation. Out of the sea, it is said, came the first life, prehistoric creatures that were the first to crawl on the shores of the new-formed continents. And still to be seen in these mysterious depths are their living counterparts, fish that can actually walk. This is the kelpfish out for a stroll. He's a grotesque descendant of some long-lost ancestor that left the primeval waters to crawl upon dry land. In this submarine setting, nature seemingly creates to amaze, and at times, her species take on an eerie beauty as she works with weird colors and unusual shapes. This is a jellyfish, one of a large family that includes many fantastic forms. These look like flowers from an undersea garden, but they're actually living creatures, members of the mollusk group known as the melibes. They're shellfish without shells, and their unencumbered mode of travel is a graceful combination of floating and underwater flying. Here's a shellfish rarely seen outside its protective cover. Yet when it does come out of hiding, the common barnacle is a creation from a fantasy. The ocean teems with the odd and the grotesque, but here's a species whose equipment is truly unique. He boasts, of all things, a built-in fishing pole. He's known as the anglerfish, and he's a serious student of the finer points of the art. But he doesn't fish just for sport. He fishes for a living. The tackle he uses isn't fancy. He's of the plain worm school. But he dangles his bait in front of every passing fish. This isn't actually a worm, it's a fleshy growth attached to his own head, but from long experience, he's found it passes for the real thing. When you've gulped your food, you're bound to end up with the hiccups. Like most fishermen, the angler is rather careless about his appearance. But his seedy-weedy disguise only makes him more deadly. It's his life's work, fooling his fellow fish, and, generally speaking, he does very well at his own game. The tricks of camouflage are known to many of nature's species, but the decorator crab makes masquerading a fine art. He's a sort of walking flower arrangement. The decorator crab achieves his final effect only after long labor. He gathers bits of seaweed and covers them with a sticky fluid he manufactures himself. And then, working more or less at random, he pastes this foliage all over his body. Little matter that it's tedious, piecemeal work. It's all worthwhile if, in the end, he looks like nothing so much as a traveling crab salad. The crabs are quite often the comedians of nature's seashore sideshow, and a species called the fiddler crab is completely uninhibited. Life may be a serious matter to others, but to these playboys, it's all fun and games. The male fiddler crab spends most of his time waving at the ladies, and one claw's oversized, the perfect equipment for this pastime. This may be a crazy courtship, but at least there's nothing subtle about the fiddler crab. When a female strolls by, he's bound and determined to catch her eye. This is the lady in question. A ravishing beauty, if there ever was one. Before she came along and got such a big hand, each of the males had scooped out a hole in the sand. And now they invite her to choose a mate and move in. Being feminine, she pretends to ignore the masculine attention. This, of course, produces the desired effect. Suddenly, the lady decides she's found the mud hole of her dreams and at last housekeeping begins. Out of the sea come incredible episodes in nature's story of survival, but none more dramatic than the saga of reproduction. The compelling urge to continue the species is nature's greatest secret of success. And in all of her creatures, from the largest to the smallest, she instills a savage determination to recreate their kind. At the breeding season, there appear off the coasts of California and Mexico great schools of tiny fish. Where they come from no one can tell, for they're seen in no other part of the world. These are the grunion. Their period for propagation is timed to the tides, and upon the highest waves they come ashore to lay their eggs. The female accomplishes this by standing on her tail and burrowing into the moist sand. Forced by the waves in their ebb and flow, she must somehow hold her ground while she spawns. Meanwhile, the male fish wraps himself around her and deposits in the buried nest the milt that will fertilize the eggs. The eggs must be laid at the very peak of the tide, otherwise they'd be washed away. But this creates an added hazard. If the fish misjudge their timing, they'll be stranded on the beach. And so this entire ritual must be executed with a delicate precision. The grunion can live out of water only a few moments, and those who overstay their limit may find themselves left behind to die. Safe in their sandy incubator, the eggs lie undisturbed, no wave reaching them. But soon the tide returns in its full flow, and now the sea itself assists in the mysterious ritual of creation. At the first touch of saltwater, the eggs hatch instantly by the millions. Now life is renewed and, once more, the continuation of the species is assured. In time, the grunion go back to the sea. In its dark depths, they will feed and grow and eventually reenact their ancient cycle. Within the sea, upon the land, life in all its mystery moves with unbroken rhythm, its ebb and flow like the waves that beat upon the shore. And like the tides, nature's world is forever restless, as turbulent as the elemental energies that reshape her globe. Of all of these, the volcano is the most spectacular, a force constantly remaking the very planet upon which life must exist. And in its fiery furnace, we find the final miracle in our story of nature's secret world. Deep in its inferno, nature continues to work her magic. From her underground furnaces, she draws off molten matter and causes the very rocks to flow like water. To mankind, the volcano seems a force of death and destruction, the destroyer of life. And yet, over the long reach of eternity, nature's volcanic action remains a creator of life, for this is one of her ways of replenishing the raw materials of our planet. This is Earth's remaking, new crust for its surface, nature's ultimate secret of life. Soon the volcano must curb its angry temper in the cooling waters of the sea. Yet in the turning cycles of time and tide and eternal change, nature will forever create and recreate and, in her timeless pattern, replenish the earth again and again with her secrets of life.
