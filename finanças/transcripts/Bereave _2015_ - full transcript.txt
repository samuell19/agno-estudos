- Garvey. I've got coffee. (somber music) - Dear God, I haven't had a dream in a long time. (ominous music) Show me that you care. (gun clicking) (somber music) - [Woman] Did you say something Garvey? - No, no I didn't. You're up early. - Can you help me put on my necklace? (slow paced music) You remember the first time our hands touched? - Why do we always have to remember things? I'd rather just look at you in the mirror. - I remember. - Evelyn. - Yes love? - You almost look beautiful. Pour me a cup of coffee before you go out. Can you do that please? I asked you not to touch this. - [Evelyn] I thought you were done using it. - And why did you think that? - [Evelyn] Because I thought you were done. - Well what letter was I on? - [Evelyn] I don't remember. - Why is that dear? - Every morning it's the same thing. You wake up, you come in here, you phone people, you say strange things. I mean, what, what's going on Garvey? What are you doing? - Am I embarrassing you? - Garvey, I'm glad we're talking again. - You ever play hangman when you were a child? - Yes, but I wasn't very good at it. I'm not very good at guessing games. - Well, it's not really a game. - Well then why don't you tell me what it is. - Two children laughing away. Missing letters while someone starts to build on a noose. Dangling from the gallows piece by piece. That's the way I feel about life. Nice strange laughter. - Well then you're not talking about life. - You know, nobody need die if you just kept adding something. A belt, shoe, hole in the shoe. - [Evelyn] We're not children Garvey. - Nobody would ever die on my noose. I even put in hair. They were perfect. - And that's why I married you. 40 years ago to this very day Garvey. Because to me, you're perfect. - I have eyes. - And you're not a stick figure and you're not hanging from a noose. - Yeah. Yeah, I gotta call Jack and I gotta ask him why he didn't put any eyes. - [Evelyn] Jack's dead. Jack's been dead for three years. - Yeah. I knew that. - Are you okay Garvey? - You think he realized there are only 26 letters in the alphabet? That he could have saved everyone from the noose! - I don't know. - He would of had to break the rules. - Do I need to take you to the doctor Garvey? - Don't be ridiculous! Now you tell me what letter I left off on, or I'll be taking you to the doctor! - You left off on the M's. - You do remember. - Yes I remember and you remember as well. - You know, this is the only thing that I can trust. - Oh come on Victor. Would you please slow down. Oops, sorry, sorry Victor, sorry. - Good morning Mr. Ellis. How are you today? - I opened my own damn door, if that's what you're asking me. - I'm sorry Mr. Ellis, but I had to use the bathroom. I couldn't, thanks. - Take the money Harry. - If I had opened your door for you sir, I could. - You know, most guys would of taken the money. But that Harry, he really is a good guy. - If you want to say something, say something I don't already know. Evelyn dear. How are you? - Oh I'm okay. - Evelyn you look sad. Are you? - No. - You really do look sad, are you okay? - Go and sit over there George. - What did I do? - Victor it's okay. - Will you go sit over there? He hasn't come to the track with me in almost two months. - He hasn't forgotten our anniversary in 40 years. - Happy anniversary. - You're not my husband. - I'll go and talk to him. I hate to see you like this. - No it's okay, I'm okay. - Did he tell you what's wrong? - Victor, let me go along my way because I don't want to feel like this in the lobby. - Harry! - You're my son, don't let a simple woman fool you. - No, no, it's not like that dad. - [Woman] Steve, can you take it to the other room? - Shh. No, no, I'm listening. - It's so early. Can you take it in the other room? - Yeah, hang on a second. Yeah, can we talk about this later? - [Blonde] Okay, I'm not coming over tonight. Enjoy. - Geez. Steve says hi. - [Victor] Stevie's a good boy. - How are you? - Not good. - Oh, why not? - Where should I begin? - At the end. Begin at the end. - Evelyn was crying. - Evelyn was crying? - Yes. - I'm jealous, I've never seen her cry. - You like that she doesn't cry. You told me that. - Look, can you do me a favor Victor. Can you smile? I mean you make me so sad. Yeah. And Victor, do me a favor, can you fix those nervous ticks? - Are we going to the track today? - No. - I can't win when you're not there. - I can't taste the mayonnaise. I get the urge to hit the jockeys. I can't go today, it's my anniversary. Evelyn would be upset. - Well then tell her happy anniversary. Or tell me what's wrong. - You remember when we were kids? - No. - We'd feel weak, feel a cold coming on. Oh, it was fun to get a fever then. Almost like going on vacation. And then we'd breathe in each others face Everyone would say, "Dumb kids making each other sick." But we knew we were cutting it in half. Do you remember that? - Yes. - Come here. I need to breathe on you. I need to cut it in half. (Garvey exhales) (solemn music) Let's see who gets better fast. Let's go to Paul's barber shop and get a cut. Fix your hair Victor. - You need to tell Evelyn. - [Garvey] I love you brother. Love you. - What happened to you? - You got a fucking problem with my hair? - No. - Fuck you George. Fuck you too Harry. (sticks clanking) - [Teacher] Alright, alright. Good, good, good, line up! - [Students] Yes sir! - You too, come on! - You were so great sweetheart. Now just be careful okay? And remember, it's just a game. Just have fun alright. - Go! (ominous music) (sticks clanking) - Come on John, pick it up! - Hey hey, stop stop stop stop stop! - [Woman] Hey, what the hell! You okay sweetie? - Ma'am off the mat. - [Teacher] Off the mat. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - It's okay. Show your discipline, technique! (suspenseful music) Go! Whoa! - Get up John! - [Teacher] Winner, Cleo! (blonde applauding) - Good job sweetie. (light music) - [Evelyn] You have the 5,000 I asked for? - You going on vacation Mrs. Ellis? - No, it's a bonus for my housekeeper. - Okay, I'll get it in pesos for you then. - [Evelyn] No, she's good. - You hiring? I am a quarter house cleaner on my moms side. - Her eldest is going to college. First member of the family. I just want to help out. - You're a good woman. - I'm in a bit of a rush Rosa. (speaks foreign language) Thank you. (perky music) (singing in foreign language) - What do you think of my hair? - Oh, I think it's up to you. - You would have made a great emperor Paulie. - Why thank you for that. My last name means the good looking one, not the emperor. (George laughing) - I mean, no disrespect Paulie but you are anything but good looking. I'm just being honest. - Bello, it's what my last name means. - Aren't you worried about people who think they see me walking out of here a mess? - And other people will see you walk out of here will say you have a good clean shave. - I want the world to understand to leave me alone. - I think a man who gives fair warning is honorable. - Oh come on Victor, will you just let him comb your hair? - Don't tell me what to do George. - Sorry. - Keep it. - Oh thank you. - So long handsome. - Yeah, see ya. - Jackie, it smells so delicious in here. It smells like young love. That's what Garvey was saying. - Oh my goodness, young love? I don't know what to say to that, I'm a New Yorker. How are you? - Everybody's fine Jackie, how about you? - I'm alright. Thanks. I'm trying to figure out how a couple stays together for so many years. - Oh we've had our moments. Sometimes he takes me by the hand and sometimes I take him. But if there's still laughing along with the fighting and the crying, it all works out, it's okay. - Well there's been a lot of crying. - Oh, I gotta go. - But you just got here. You haven't even had your coffee. - Mm. Thank you. - [Victor] Where I grew up. - [George] Really? - Yeah. Not what you were expecting huh? - [George] No. - Once upon a time. Family came over from England with Garvey. I was born here. I'm the only Yank in the family. Odd man out. Come on. I'll show you something about poverty. Boarded up. - It's really okay Victor. I can see it from the outside. Let's just, come back another time okay. - You can see it from the outside? - Whoa, whoa, Victor, Victor. What are you doing? - You don't have to come in. - Hi Evelyn dear. (phone ringing) - Going to answer it? - No. - Garvey. I just want to see that I'm happy that we're together on this day. And I know that-- - What's in that box there darling? - It's our cake. - I'm sorry Evelyn dear but I don't want cake today. - What's gotten into you Garvey? (phone ringing) Hello. Talk to me Garvey. Talk to me. Tell me why you don't want my cake. I mean these, these last few months mean... Why are you acting like this? What are you doing? - It's our cake dear. - Now it's our cake Garvey! Now it is our cake! - Poor old Jackie, after all that effort. - Poor Jackie? (phone ringing) Poor Jackie? Look at me Garvey. - [Garvey] Yeah, what is it? - Look at me! - I am. - Answer that! Answer it! - I don't want to. - Why? Why? What is it? - It's just a phone! Ringing! (phone clanking) Now I see where Penelope gets it. - Garvey, Garvey, why are you doing this? - Just so you know, I gave the housekeeper the rest of the week off. So, if you want to throw anymore food around-- - Garvey! Just give me a reason! Just give me a reason! I just... I do not believe this act of yours! And I will not allow myself to believe it! And if you think that two months will wear me down, then you are so wrong! Give me another 40 years and then maybe, maybe, maybe! Why are you staring at me! - Mommy, you keep fixing my jacket. - Okay, remember what I told you. What did mommy say? - You don't want me to play the hello game with grandpa. - That's a good girl. Not the hello game nor any other game of the sort. - Why mommy? - Because the hello game is not a game. Baseball is a game. Understand what mommy said? Okay. - [Garvey] I'm not arguing with you! - [Evelyn] Garvey let's just! I just wish you'd say let's go for a walk together! - Oh mommy, grandma's playing the hello game. - That's not the hello game, they're arguing. (Penelope knocking) - For crying out loud. It's open! Oh oh! Hey yeah! - Really dad? Is that necessary? - What's up? What's happening here? Hey yeah! - Mommy, you ruined my coat. - Mommy doesn't like it when you scream, okay honey? - [Garvey] Well we weren't expecting you today Penelope, but we are happy to see you. - There is cake on the floor. - I bet your mommy doesn't want you eating cake off the floor. Am I right? Smart girls the Ellis family. - Dad, you forgot to wear your pants today. - Oh boy. Well, grandpa must go and change his pants now Cleo. - You don't have to grandpa. - [Penelope] Mom, what is going on? - Enough Penelope, leave your father alone. Cleo! - [Penelope] I could hear you both in the hall by the way. All the way out there! (Cleo screaming) - [Evelyn] What happened to you Cleo? When did you become so uptight? It's just noise, you used to love everything. Cleo, Cleo, Cleo, please stop screaming. (Cleo screaming) Cleo stop screaming. Cleo, Cleo, Cleo, stop screaming please. Grandma's got a terrible headache. Grandma's had a terrible day but I'm just so happy to see you. So happy. - Here we go! Grandpa looks good now. Come on, sit down. Come and sit with me. Ah, good girl. You want to ride a horse? Come on then. Off we go! - See, this is what I mean mom. I can't have that. - Can't have what? - Please daddy, please. She's too heavy. I don't want her sitting on your lap. - Nonsense. - You're not helping me like this. - Well then maybe you should drop your daughter off at daycare so that you and I can carry on with our conversation. - It's not daycare, I have a nanny for her. - Well it's not motherhood either is it? You know, you're giving your milk to the corporations. You just trying asking for it back, see what you get. - Not everything is a poem dad. - Enough! Enough, that's enough! ♪ One ♪ ♪ Fine day ♪ ♪ In springtime ♪ ♪ On the brow of (voice quivering) ♪ ♪ Thy name be brave ♪ (Garvey coughing) - Garvey, Garvey. Are you alright? - I'm grandpa. - [Cleo] Grandpa. - I'll get you some water. - No. (somber music) I. I am-- - I'm sorry I brought the cake. (light music) - How are you today? - I missed you grandpa. - Well, that's no good. - Why not? - So, did you fight with the boys today? - I did. John hit me with the sticks on the head, but I won! - Well Johnny's a dummy. (Cleo giggling) - He's lucky I didn't have my kamagong stick. - Oh yes he is. Yes he is. Come on. Let's go up to our secret place. - [Penelope] Mom, he's almost gotten cruel. - Your father is anything but cruel. - Why is it every time I come here I feel like I'm from some other country? I feel like I'm Chinese. - Because you like to fight Penelope. You love the argument and then you act like you don't. - That is not true. - Oh, just enough with that self-pity of yours. You're making me feel queasy. - Well I don't want to fight about it. - So did you bring the sleeping pills that I asked you to get? - You shouldn't even be taking these. You remember your episodes? We caught you in the kitchen lunging at the refrigerator with butter knives screaming (speaking foreign language). I mean these are the reasons why your doctor says you're sleep walking. - You can tell that doctor of yours that I haven't slept in three nights and I still beat the refrigerator. - How come you didn't want to play the hello game with me today? - Because mommy didn't let me. - Oh, but did she say why? - She said good girls don't scream like that. - Did she now? - What does the tooth fairy do with my teeth? - Oh there is no tooth fairy. - Mommy says the tooth fairy comes and takes it and gives me money. - Well Mommy's lying. - Bad mommy. - Yes, I agree, bad, bad mommy. There's no Santa Claus either. - Bad grandpa! (Garvey chuckling) - Listen, you put that tooth under your pillow and wait. Do you think you can stay awake the whole night? - I can try. - I mean, when she comes in the middle of the night, if she sees you looking at her, she's gonna get very ugly. And she starts to glow blue and then her teeth get bigger and sharper, and then she'll try and bite ya. Harder than a dog. That's why she collects all these teeth, to bite people. - There is no tooth fairy. - That's my girl! (Garvey laughing) - [Cleo] Can we play a game again today? - [Garvey] You wanna play the game? What, up and down the stairs? - [Cleo] Yeah. - That's Garvey and that's me. And that's Garvey and that's me. Four years of my life and my brothers life etched in these little lines. Stuck in there somehow. - That's beautiful. - That's not the right word. - You feel better now? - They're fading now. - Listen Victor, we really better go now 'cause this is considered breaking and entering. - Wait in the car George. - [Garvey] Come on Cleo, a little bit more and you'll win! (Garvey laughing) - That's enough! Cleo, we're leaving! - [Cleo] No, I'm gonna win mommy! I'm gonna win mommy! - [Garvey] That's right. - Say goodbye to your grandpa before he kills you on the stairs. - Bye grandpa. - Bye Cleo. And don't forget what I taught you. - I won't, I won't, I love you! (somber music) (Garvey grunting) - Put your seatbelt on. You know mommy can't do anything until you do that. - Mommy. Is the tooth fairy real? - Of course she is. - Does she have teeth? - Well she has wings and collects teeth. Did grandpa say something? What's the matter sweetie? - Nothing. - Okay, well sit up. You know mommy doesn't like it when you do that. - [Cleo] Are we still going to the park? - I thought you'd forgotten about that. - Ice cream. - You're a little monster you know that? - I'm not a monster, you're a monster! - Oh. (Penelope growling) (ominous music) - [Evelyn] Garvey? Garvey what's wrong? - It's okay, it's okay. I'm okay. I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine. Now listen, I was just playing a little game here. - [Evelyn] You're in pain, you're in pain. - You're absolutely right. - Shall I call the doctor. - No, no, no, no. I'm fine. I'm fine, I'm fine. Just a... Listen honey, will you go get my coat? I think I forgot it in the living room. I want to go for a walk with you. - You do? - Yes. - Garvey? Garvey! - Mrs. Ellis. Mrs. Ellis, come on. - Look at this Garvey. - Sir. What are you doing in here? Drop the weapon! - You know, we used to keep the dog outside. - Put it down! - I'm not sure how mother would feel about pigs. - Drop your weapon now! - Drop the fucking weapon! - Why don't you come and fucking get it! (officer tasing) - [Girl] Oh my god did you-- - [Girl In Pink] Dude, that kid Matthew, he's so hot. - I hope he asks me out. - [Girl] Wait, he's dating, he's dating that girl. - Okay, Matthew's ugly-- - Was her name Betty? - Ruby. - So the guy was really mad at me and he started coming at me and I'm like boom. - Yeah, whatever. - Pushing contest. - Hey, get off! Get off! - [Girl In Black] Look at these boys. - Oh, they're so tough. - Keep going bitches! - Fuck off loser! - Fuck you! - What are you looking at old man? - You want to earn $100? - You a Herbert old man? - A what? Herbert? I don't think so. Listen, all you gotta do is punch me really hard. - You wanna ride my skateboard too? - Punch me hard, right here in the stomach. - Where's the money then? - There. - Screw you man! My old man said not to hit crazy old people! - [Garvey] Oh yeah? And what does your old man say about two bills? - You take your meds today grandpa? - Come on, hit me in the stomach you big pussy! (Garvey grunting) - Holy shit! - Oh god! - Go, go! - [Blonde] Oh my god! Are you okay? - Yeah I'm-- - Do you want me to follow them? Do you want me to call the police? - No, no. Could you help me to the bench over here? Thank you. Okay, that's fine, that's fine. Thank you. Won't you just sit for five minutes? - Okay. Are you sure you're okay? What, do I have something in my hair? - No. A white flower caught in the wind of an old mans eye. Is she as delicate I wonder. Ah, her cheeks have gone the colors of the leaves on the tree. - You need to cut that out. (Garvey chuckling) I should go. - No, just sit. Come on. If I get too fresh, you can just punch me in the stomach. Please, please. Look, you'll bring the birds back. - I'll bring the birds back? Okay. - What's your name? - Lauren. - Because you saved my life today Lauren, would you mind if I rest my head on your shoulder? - I don't think I saved your life. But you can rest your head on my shoulder if you want to. (ducks quacking) - Life felt like a watermelon seed whose spit I ask. And red stained teeth smiled at me. I used to bring a beautiful lady, kiss her on this bench a long long time ago. When our lips were young like yours. Funny, I never even thought, Lauren, I never thought that they would change like that. - That's beautiful. - No, what's beautiful is that you would have chased those kids for me. Would you have done it if I had said yes? - No. Probably not. - Well, the woman is at least honest. But is she hungry? (Lauren chuckling) - I could eat. - Remember when I used to rest on you like this? - Yeah I remember and I remember when I used to pick you up and carry you to your room to your bed so you could sleep. - Why can't I make you feel like that mom? Why can't kids do that for their parents? - Do what? - Could pick you up, I can carry you wherever I like, but I can't take you to a place to rest. To feel safe like you used to make me feel. I can carry you into the same room, the same bed, the same sleep, and I don't know, it'd be different. - Feelings go away when you have your own children. Then you carry them. - And if they don't? - I don't know. I just know what happened to me. I don't know anything else. - I'm thinking of breaking up with Natalie. - I was waiting for you to do that. Oh I know she has pretty eyes and big big breasts. (Steve chuckles) It's good that you stayed with her. - So, you and dad, you're gonna go out to dinner tonight? - When you worry you look just like your father used to when he was younger. So handsome. - He still does. - I don't know where he is. How can that be? - I'm sure he'll show up soon enough. - No, he doesn't want to be found. This morning he lied to me. He told me to go get his coat and then he just ran away. Your father resents lying. - I know where he is. - Where is he then? These last two months where? - Tattoo parlor. Getting Evelyn is my baby scrawled across his chest. (somber music) Ugh, listen, I gotta go. - You're leaving? - Yeah, I gotta go. Hey. - Why are all the men in my life running away from me? What did I do Steve? - You're in a state today. Don't say silly things like that, you didn't do anything. Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm. I'm not gonna go 'til you smile. Yeah alright, that's good. I love you guys. - Go, go get out of here before I start getting angry with you too. - Alright, tell dad I stopped by. - [Dispatch] Code six, 105 North Avenue 52. - Who is the bail commissioner handling this? - The Lieutenants not in right now. - What is the Lieutenants name? - Gronagan, Lieutenant Gronagan. - Tell Lieutenant Gronagan that Victor Ellis is in the hotel. - I'll bring you towels and a bar of soap sir. - You do that. - Would you like anything else? - Champagne. And you had better bring me some Viagra too. You never know who you might have to fuck in here. - Who you gonna fuck first so we know? - This could be your lucky day. - Is Evelyn your-- - Wife. Does that surprise you? - No, of course not. That's a beautiful name. - Yes, it is. It's 40 years to date beautiful. - 40 years, like, like it's your anniversary? - Yes. It is. - [Lauren] Forgive me, but why are you two not together right now? - Because I love her. - What do you mean? - My dear, I would have to tell my wife before I tell you. - Well what is love Garvey if not dinner on your anniversary? - I don't know, love for me right now is like exercise. I go up and down the stairs trying to die. Trying to burn the fat of love. What little remains right off. Because it's going to rot soon. - It's going to rot. - Because it takes a lot of time and work to make love. To have love, to stand in front of the mirror with someone and see a flawed perfect body of love. And if it touches your hand just at the right time, well then. - It's beautiful the way that you say it. - You know, if you're stubborn, if you take care of it constantly, if you sacrifice your life to it, there'll be a time when people will say, "Ah, he must've been so handsome long ago." It's the strangest saddest thing. Alright now, where were we before we got so melancholy? - We were laughing. - Ah. (glasses clinking) To you. Oh, I remember. I was offering you a job. - Right. I still don't understand what you want me to do really. - Just show up every day. - And what do you want me to do? - I just want you to wait every day. Wait by the headstones eight hours a day like you would in an office. Now you can read a book, you can listen to music, it doesn't matter. I will arrange everything. Can you do that for me? - What am I waiting for? - For me. I'll come visit you soon. And then you'll read the contents of this later. - You know I'm just an unemployed violinist. But I'm not so sure. - Well a fireman's unemployed until there's a fire. The angels too. Just like that. Sometimes, only the violin can save us. - Well then, we'll have to ask an angel how she pays her rent. (Lauren chuckling) - You know Lauren, when I get really sad, I feel like a mute. And when I get even sadder, and I can't be heard, I only speak violin. - You know, this is the first time in my whole life I ever wished I were an old lady. - [Waitress] Mr. Ellis, only the best. - Oh, thank you so much, thank you. There we go. You know Lauren, I was very lucky bumping into you today. Lawyers, they won't understand what's in that letter. And you? You saved me twice. (Lauren chuckling) Oh no. (slow paced music) (speaking foreign language) - You son of a bitch! (door slamming) So, how was your walk? Hm? - Evelyn? You okay? What the hell happened here? - George, what are you doing here? - I was just a little concerned-- - Why don't you go and be concerned over there? - I really can't stay. Are you sure you're okay? - Of course I'm okay. I have a glass of wine and a sword. - Where's Garvey? - Where is he George? Where is he? - I have some bad news. - Well why don't you just throw it over there with the cake. - Victor's been arrested Evelyn. - Victor's been arrested? Well what did he do? - He stabbed a door. Sorry Evelyn. Maybe you should go lie down and try to get some sleep okay? - I've got some sleeping pills. - Then maybe you shouldn't be drinking, huh? - Why don't you just go away. Go. I'll tell Garvey. Go. - Sure. Sure thing. (light gentle music) (opera music) (door slamming) - Victor's in jail. - [Garvey] What did he do? - Stabbed a door. - [Garvey] Have you been drinking? - Yes, have you? - [Garvey] Yup. - Well then, he still stabbed a door. - Look, I don't mind that you broke everything, but now we don't have a phone. - I'll give you my cellphone. Number's on it. - Hello. Yes. I'm inquiring about a Victor Ellis. Yeah hello? Yes. Oh he is? Thank you, I'll be right down. Yeah, bye-bye. - No, no, you keep it. You may need it. - [Garvey] I don't want it. - You want me to go with you? - No. You're tired love. You need some rest. I'll be back later. I missed you today. (slow paced music) - Garvey. You'll want your coat. (door slamming) - And where were you going all dressed up without me? - I didn't think you were coming over. - Can we be friends? - Wow, let me see what that looks like, turn around. It looks good. (door slamming) - Steve! Come on, open the door! - No, I'm not letting you in. - Open the fucking door! - Are you blushing? - I didn't mean what I said about your dad. Come on, I'm naked. Steve, come on! - You cold? - Open the god damn door! - You gonna be nice? - Fucking open it Steve. - It was unlocked. (Natalie slapping) Ow! Wow! That-- - It's fucking cold. - Is good. - Yeah? - Mm hm. Come here. (melancholy music) (singing in foreign language) - [Evelyn] So what do you think it feels like Garvey? - And they all lived happily ever after. The end. - Read me one more story mommy. - Cleo, what has gotten into you tonight? It is really really late for you. Time for bed okay baby? - But I'm not tired. - Cleo stop it. Time for bed, mommy said, okay? Now, did you put your tooth under your pillow? - No. - [Penelope] Why not? - Because I don't want the tooth fairy to come. - That's nonsense, she's coming. Where did you put it? - In my coat. - Okay, I'll go get it. Here it is! One tooth for the tooth fairy. Lift up. There ya go. Okay, goodnight sweet pea. - [Cleo] Goodnight. (ominous music) - Hurry up alright. - [Male] Alright. - Jesus. - Hey Tommy! - [Tommy] What? - It smells like fish and beer. - [Tommy] The alley or your dick? - How's your mother doing these days? I miss her. - [Tommy] Yeah, she misses you too. - Tell her you're gonna be a fag in Russia. - [Male] Did you say beer? - [Male] Yeah I did. - You got five bucks? - You got a dollar? - Fuck you. - Nah, come here buddy, come here. I got a 10 spot for you. - [Homeless Man] 10 bucks. - Yeah, I like you. You remind me of a bum I know. Come here, come here. (ominous music) - Are you fucking with me? Quit fucking with me. Yeah, I like you too. - What's in there? - [Homeless Man] God, that's his house. (homeless man grunting) - [Male] Jesus. Come on Billy, come on. - [Billy] Fuck him, fuck him. - I think you already did. Leave him alone, let's go. - [Billy] I like you. (phone ringing) - Where the fuck is George? - I don't know. - He is the worst driver I have ever had. - Why do you keep him? - Same reason as you keep me. - Victor, what am I gonna do about you? - Nothing. - Oh man. You look good brother. - I just wanted to see our old house. - [Male] Victor Ellis. (slow paced music) (voice whispering) ♪ I said I loved ya ♪ ♪ Lying in your arms last night ♪ ♪ I said I need ya ♪ - [Victor] I wanted to see the inside. - Yeah, sure. All Cognac is brandy, but not all brandy is Cognac. - We're drinking scotch. - Gentlemen, is it half empty or half full tonight? - It's half broken Renata. - And I love it when you do that. - [Garvey] Do what? - Smile. - I didn't smile. - Can we just drink together. I want to sit by you and drink and not say anything. - Yeah, sure. Renata, it's okay. Just give us a little room here. We'll do some shots later. - Alright. - I met this beautiful beautiful girl in the park today. - You what? - She was, an angel. ♪ I had to say something ♪ ♪ That you wanted to hear me say ♪ ♪ I said I loved ya ♪ - Stop it Victor! - Why? - Because I'm your older brother. Well at least for a little while anyway. - Why? - That's the way it is. Hey Victor, Victor! - [Tommy] Since you're not my best man anymore. - So that means I can fuck your wife 'cause that's what you just told me. - You're going to hell, you know that? Do you know that right? You're gonna go straight to fucking hell. - I don't care about that. I like fucking hell. Dig ditches there like I fucking connect pipes over here. Only difference is I see the motherfuckers in the suits burning right next to me. It's fucking magic tonight. - She looks kind of beautiful man. - She does. - I don't know man, maybe someone heard you say you wanted to get married. - Sweetheart, Halloween is over. - Billy, come on man. Leave her alone man. She's just an old lady. (Billy clapping) - She's more fucked up than we are buddy. (ominous music) - Evelyn. Evelyn? - She looks like she's dreaming or something man. You know what, I bet she's sleep walking. That's what this is. I saw this on TV one time man. These people, they're sleep walking and they go into this trance. Alright, and they don't know what they're doing and they don't remember it at all the next day. - [Billy] Nah, she's gonna remember this tomorrow. - Seriously, listen to me man. On this TV show alright, this guy, he kills his mother-in-law, okay. And he gets away with it because he blames the whole thing on sleep walking. - A fucking genius. Hi Evelyn. - That's fucking crazy. - Thank you Evelyn. - What the fuck's in the envelope? - Pictures. - What do you mean? What kind of pictures? - Cats, pictures of cats. Look, I'm looking out for you. The cats, they got the parasites, you know-- - Shut the fuck up about the cats. That's a bank envelope. Now look, we both found her I want my half. - I wanna have fun. Hold her hand. You want half, hold her hand. - You lost your fucking mind, hold this. Hey. Hey hey lady. - I love you Garvey. - Tell her you love her. - Jesus Christ. Lady stop it. Don't. What should I do? Should I fucking kiss her? I love you too miss, alright. Just don't... What the fuck? Jesus. - Dude, you are going straight to fucking hell. - She got a fucking death grip on me right now man. - [Billy] Look at this shit. A fucking taxi. Hey, hey, hey! - What am I supposed to do? She's digging her nails into my wrist? - [Billy] Bring her over here. - Come here, come here. - I don't usually go this way at night. Those guys that flagged me, were they friends of yours, those two guys? It's a bad place for a lady in white if you know what I mean. Well, I mean the meter runs, the numbers glow and it's nighttime. Sometimes it's lonely. - [Tommy] So what are we doing huh? - [Billy] You gonna make the call? - Yeah I'll make the call. Who am I gonna call? - [Billy] I don't know, fucking call everybody on the phone. Get 'em out of the house. - Alright. - [Billy] Call the pope. Call me. (Tommy laughing) Don't fucking laugh, you're gonna fuck it up. (heavy breathing) (phone buzzing) - [Natalie] Don't answer it. - Mm mm mm mm. - [Natalie] Don't answer it. - Shit, shit, it's my mom. - Don't answer it. - [Steve] She never calls this late. Hold on, hold on. - What? - [Steve] Yeah, mom. Is everything okay? - Yes hello, is this her relative? Evelyn. Evelyn Ellis. Yes sir, I'm sorry to inform you, but there was an accident this evening. Yes, she's in the hospital. No, she's in critical condition and stuff. An SUV hit her. - [Billy] She looked pretty mangled. (men laughing) You fucked it up. - [Tommy] You said she was fucking mangled. - And the paramedics don't say "And stuff." - [Tommy] You're fucking hysterical. Oh you should of-- (phone ringing) Oh shit! Hang up, hang up, hang up, hang up, hang up. Decline, they could be tracing the call. Hang up. Oh fuck. (phone ringing) - Shit! Shut up! Oh my god. - Nobody picked up. Fuck it, let's just go to the house. Yeah? - [Male] Yeah. - Alright. (ominous music) (bat thudding) - Mommy! Mommy! Wake up. Come on. (horn honking) - Where am I? Where am I? Get me out of here! - Lady-- - Get me out of here! Who the hell are you! - Lady relax. - Get me out of here! - Relax lady, isn't this where you wanted to go? - What's happened to me? - Lady, some guys put you in my cab and told me to take you here. - What guys? I don't know any guys! - Calm down! Listen-- - Get me out! - Do you know where you live? - [Evelyn] Of course I know where I live! - Okay, don't get mad at me! - Just get me home! Get me home! - I'll take ya anywhere you wanna go. - Get me home! Get me home! - Where's home? - Sir, for the 10th time, we have a Penelope Ellis here. We don't have an Evelyn, and she's not in ICU. - What the hell's going on here? You okay? Where's mom? Hey sweetie. (phone ringing) - [Phone Voicemail] Hello, no one is available to take your call. Please leave a message after the tone. - Hello Steve, listen, I have a bit of a problem. Mom is missing. I don't know where she is. I called her phone and some guy answered and then he hung up. And when I called back again there was no answer. So, I don't know who's got her phone. - She's in the hospital daddy. - Please Steve, I have a headache and you're asking me to think. I don't know what to tell you, I'm in this hospital. Cleo hit me in the head with a Kamagong stick. - Hey, it's okay. - Oh sweetheart. I didn't mean anything by that. Mommy didn't mean anything. I'm just saying, I have a headache. - Yeah but these people, they called from moms cell. (ominous music) - How much do you want? Are you that greedy? - I don't know why we're doing this. We've already got $5,000. Isn't that enough? - Grow a pair of balls man, come on. - I have a pair of balls. - Grow a pair of balls. - [Tommy] I have a pair, I'm just not a fucking twat. - I don't know, you got that purse. Try on the fucking heels. You look good. I fucked your sister by the way. Shh, shut the fuck up. - [Tommy] What do we do? - Shit. Alright. (men whispering) Let's go. Come on, come on. (keys jangling) - [Tommy] Which fucking key is it? - I'll finger fuck that lock like it's 16. - [Tommy] It's unlocked. (glass clanking) - Evelyn? - [Male] Where the fuck are the lights? Holy shit. Looks like somebody already hit this joint. Look, just grab something and let's get the fuck out of here okay? - The fuck out here. - Let's go, let's go. What are you? - Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey! - [Garvey] Who are you! - Hey relax old man. Put the gun down before I hurt you man. Put the gun down! - Where's Evelyn? - Oh that's right, think of Evelyn. Evelyn, 'cause he's got the purse and shit, right? Evelyn. - What have you done with my wife? - Nothing yet sir, relax, it's roses and shit. Alright. No, no, no, no! - You're the one who answered the phone. - That dip shit answered the phone, I didn't answer the phone. - Do you know where my wife is? - No. - Why doesn't he talk? - Don't, please, please, don't don't. - You know where my wife is? - Yes, yes, yes I do. Yes sir yes. - Oh. Evelyn. I love you. - Holy shit Billy. That's exactly what she said. (gun clicking) (Billy grunting) - That fuck tried to shoot me man. Pops forgot the fucking bullets. - Billy, no, no, no, no, no, no. (gun firing) Oh my god! Jesus! Oh fuck! Oh shit!shit! (suspenseful music) - Not yet. Do you hear me! Not yet. God. Just, just add a little hair to my head. A hole in my shoe. Break the rules, break the rules. Just make me perfect. - What's wrong? Are you alright? - It's okay. Oh, you're okay Evelyn. I just that thought that I wasn't going to be able to save you. Where did you go? - I don't know. I took some sleeping pills and when I woke up, cabbie tried to dump me on the wrong side of town. - Oh. I hope it feels like that. I really do. - What feels like that? You're sweating. Do you want me to move you Garvey because you don't look okay. - No. - [Garvey] No. This is so good here. - I think I should move you Garvey. - Death has been good to me. - What are you talking about? - Gave me an extra five minutes. - What are you talking about? I'm gonna go get the doctor. - No, no. I want you to go downstairs, get my coat. - I won't do that. - Evelyn-- - I don't want to leave you. - You're not leaving me. I'm leaving me. Oh you're beautiful. So beautiful. (somber music) (Garvey grunting) Oh God. I want to go for a walk. Would you please get my coat? I think I left it in the lobby when I was looking for you. - Mom. Mom! - Leave me, leave me. - What the hell is going on? - Your father's dead. (Steve banging) - What are we doing Victor? - I want you to cut it off Paul. - [Paul] How short? - All of it. I want it all gone. - What's happening Victor? - Cut it off! (clippers buzzing) Who the fuck are you? - Uncle Victor, please. - I'm just a friend. - How do you know my brother? - Garvey, he told me to come here. He said the Ellis family burial plot. He said he would come here. - Why is grandpa in the box? He doesn't wanna be in there. Put him out! - It's okay Cleo. Grandpa's okay. Angels come down and took him. - You're a liar, you're a liar, you're a liar! - Honey, honey calm down, it's okay. Here. It's okay. - Dear family, (slow paced music) I miss you. - [Garvey] What I wouldn't give for us to walk together today. To breathe in air, to feel the sun. I didn't know if I should write a letter about things I couldn't do. I ruined so many pieces of paper. It's difficult to say last words. Closer and closer as the pains in my stomach took hold of me, so did the fears in my head. They said I was out of time, not much time left to live. Forgive me. I kept it a secret from you. I didn't want you to suffer. I'm not sure what happens next, but tell me please, how fast are the clouds moving. In here, I imagine dirt, I imagine darkness, I imagine silence. It's not pain you feel in your hearts, it's just me. I live in there now. Try not to cry me away. Please, visit me once in a while here and I will visit you in your sleep, in your dreams. I grew to be an old man and saw that love glows like the moon. I stared into it with you until I went gladly blind. I close my eyes now. Try to understand, all these years my soul was a small, small grape. Life crushed it and made wine. I hope you took the time to drink of me and felt dizzy. - I kiss you all. (birds chirping) - I'm okay Steve. - Tell me how you do that. - I'm afraid. Steve I'm afraid if I open my mouth the beasts chewing up my heart will leap out and rip up the world. Don't make me do that. There's no right way to die. They're all wrong. I've got to go. - I know you probably think it's stupid I'm crying right now. - No. - But your father, he rested his head on my shoulder in the park and later we were drinking wine. - You drank wine with my father? - We did. (slow paced music) (solemn music) - Cleo. Cleo stop it! Can't you see that mommy's hurting? - I want grandpa. - I do too. Believe me, I do. - I want grandpa. - Hey! - What are you doing? - Hey! - I don't wanna play. - Why? Why can't you play? - You're not grandpa! Don't cry mommy, please don't cry! (Penelope crying) - Please. (Cleo screaming) - Now you! - Hey! Hey! Hey. I love you so much. - [Cleo] I love you too. (slow paced music) (slow light gentle music) (light singing in foreign language) (somber music)
