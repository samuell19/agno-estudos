♪ 'Cause, baby You're my secret ♪ ♪ My dirty little secret ♪ So don't tell ♪ Don't tell ♪ See, baby, you're my secret ♪ My dirty little secret ♪ So don't tell [Tarron] I got married to my wife, Secret, when I was 26. Damn. That's close to a decade ago, and I have to say, I must've been crazy, heh, to get married so young. I was at my sexual peak. I barely even knew her, or who I was for that matter. But it was love at first sight. Look at her. Prom queen, captain of the cheerleading squad in college. Winner of the Miss Beauty Pageant, and now my wife. I mean, in the beginning, it was sex all the time. In the kitchen, park, on the counter, in the car, on the car. Now it's just dry sex and hand jobs. Look, don't get me wrong, I'm the most loyal husband a woman could ask for. [record scratch] [moaning] [heavy breathing] It's the faithful part [scoffs] that I have a problem with. [people shouting] Come on, let's go number 19. Let's go, T, let's go, baby, run, run, run! Let's go, let's go, let's go, run, run, run, run, run! Woo! Yeah, baby! Touchdown! [laughs] [phone pings] [Tarron] "Be careful, I'm watching you?" Yeah, that's about right. Damn near anything's better than this team. These kids are trash. Except your son. Yo, make sure you don't miss this poker game, all right? -Look, man, I'll be there. -[Tweet] All right. I just got a lot going on, man, a lot of my plate. Really? What you got, another jump off or somethin'? No, man. Life, work. -Hmm. -Yeah. Well look at life is working with here. Look what the Lord has done. [Tarron] Yeah. Okay, pun, you don't wanna be a player no more? That's good 'cause I was done, you know, competin' with you. Tweet? It's not a competition. It was gettin' bad, I was tearin' your ass up. -Man, it was crazy. -Okay. [Terrance] Dad, dad. -What's up, what's up? Ah. -Look at this little dude. Oh, ooh, ooh. We gotta work on that. Good job. Hey, man, I'm proud of ya. You made me $40. Anyway, I'ma see you at that poker game, all right? -Stay up. -All right, man. You did good, man, I'm proud of you. Got you a TD today. [Inaudible] -Dad. -What? Boy, give me my phone. Who's that woman? That's not mom. Don't I know her? No, you don't know her. That's not nobody. -What was she doing? -She was eating breakfast. What? She was eating breakfast. A banana for breakfast. Terrance, do not go through my phone. [sighs] [upbeat music playing] Look, man, just ask before you go through my phone. Bananas are healthy, good for her. She probably has low potassium or something, I don't know. Terrance? -I'll call you back. -Hey, daddy. [Tarron] Hey, baby. What's wrong with him? Do you have the stuffing? Thank you. Don't worry about cleaning up. Always got something to say. Be quiet. So what, is them your crayons? No, it's his. [Tarron] Uh huh, good answer. [knocks on door] Hey, buddy. [Terrance] Dad. Come here, let me talk to you. -Yeah. Right there. -What's up? "What's up?" Look. I know you may be a little confused about what you saw today. But there was a picture of a girl on-- Hey, hey, hey. [soft music playing] [sighs] So, what you saw on my phone, and you're gonna have to trust me when I tell you that everything is gonna be okay. -All right? -All right. -[Tarron] Deal? -[Terrance] Yeah. Give me some. Come on, a little more energy. Huh? [blows] -Hey, you got some homework? -[Terrance] Yeah. Get to it. [grunts] So, what about that new bike? What new bike? The bike that you said you were going to get me after Thanksgiving dinner. So this is... Is this what we gonna do right now? Some type of little blackmail situation? [chuckles] Do your homework and we'll talk about it. All right. Hey, I love you. Okay. So, I need to... Basil. I can't smell any basil. I told you to put some basil on that damn bird. Mm-hm, see, I know you're trippin' now 'cause you know you smell that basil. -Oh, I don't. How are you, honey? -[Inaudible]. -Everything smells good. -Thank you. Where is that lying ass son of mine? He was supposed to pick me up. He said Jay was gonna get you. -No. -[door opens then closes] -Well, hello, son. -Hey, ma. You got it? -It's hot. -Ooh. -Thank you. -[Inaudible]. -Hey, ma. -Hmm. My favorite woman in the whole wide world. Honey, don't be jealous but you do know I still have it going on. Yes, you do, but you know what, you can keep your son and his crusty draws. You know what? Everybody Anna Mae, until Ike show up. [Secret mumbling] [Jay] That ain't no way to treat a lady. Hey, ma. -[Motherdear] How are you? -[Secret] Hi, Jay. Like you would know. [Jay] What's up, Secret, how you doin'? I can't get no love? Still haven't learned to appreciate what he has in this world. [tense music playing] -You done with your observations, Sherlock Homeless? -[Jay laughs] You both are just getting on my damn nerves. [Secret laughs] Here, Tarron, take this in. Take the greens in. Jay's standin' right there. Well, isn't he a guest in your house? Go ahead, get the rolls, too. [Jay snickers] -You got this, Secret? -Yes. Hey, what's up? [Secret] Hey. ♪ We don't always See eye to eye ♪ ♪ At the time we're [Tarron] When the man upstairs spun the wheel, and the little balls start rollin', this is the family that I ended up with, for better, or for worse. Me and my brother Jay were raised by my mother after my dad left us. He got remarried and moved to New York. I was pushed into the man role of the house, and Jay? Well, let's just say he was pushed into the can't get it together, drink too much, no responsibility, always in some shit role. This is my Mike Lowrey clone brother-in-law, Stephen. Always talkin' about being a Fed, heh. But he couldn't solve a Rubik's Cube. This is my sister-in-law, Doris. They represent everything that society told us to be. The more I watch them, the more anxiety I feel, because I'm not sure I ever want to become what they are. Boring. [glass clinks] Everybody, everybody, come on. Can we just hold hands, okay? Yeah. Thank you. Dear Lord, thank you so much for this food. Bless us. [Tarron] Yeah, okay. So, what's up, man, how's the FBI life treating you? We them boys? [both chuckle] You don't wanna know. -At the end of the day... -Hmm. ...it's just job that pays the bills. It's barely doing that these days. Hey, that's not necessarily your fault. You know how Doris is, man, trying to keep up with them Kardashians. [both laughing] Man, I'm laughin', but it ain't funny. Man, I don't know how I let her talk me into -buying a house in this expensive ass community. -[Tarron] Mm. I feel your pain. I mean, Secret isn't necessarily a bargain shopper either. Yeah. Those the women we chose. And we're stuck with 'em. Let me ask you somethin'. You ever think what your life would be like if you were still single? Not necessarily. I mean, me and Doris got married when I was 32, so... And? See the way I see it, the average man is not ready for marriage before 30. We got all that testosterone built up, man. That shit'll kill ya. Man, who you tellin'? [both laughing] Drivin' me crazy. You and Secret got married young and fast. How's that working out with you? Between me and you? -Not that great. -[Stephen] I could imagine. You see, see, you never got a chance to experience life. Live on your own, find out who you are, more or less, who she is. [Tarron] I'm not even the same person I was when we first met. Right now, it just feels like we're two ships passing in the night. I mean, and don't get me wrong, man, I love her. I love the shit out of her. But I just feel like I'm outgrowing her. Sometimes what I bring to the table in this relationship, I just feel like I'm getting the short end of the stick. I don't know, man, that shit pisses me off. [sighs] You know what? I deserve the perfect woman. I deserve the perfect woman, man. Let me give you another piece of advice. That's bullshit. That's an illusion, my brother. [Tarron] [inaudible] The answer to your problems ain't out there. It's in there. [soft orchestral music playing] [Stephen] I'ma go check out this game. [Tarron] Hmm. [Stephen] You comin'? [sighs] [Jay] Yo. I bet them NBA dudes be swattin' away pussy like flies. [Jay chuckles] [Kurt] I don't know, man. I think you might be surprised. These boys are human, all right? I'm pretty sure most of them just want one good woman that they can come home to, those that don't want him just for what they got to offer. [men laughing] [chuckles] You hear this, nigga? -All of a sudden it's one woman. -[Kurt] Wow. You do know we know you, right? [chuckles] I'm married, all right, I got a wife now. -[Tweet] You got a dick, too. -[laughs] [Tweet] Probably had that longer. -Tweet? -Yeah? You gotta grow up some time, bro. All right? -Seriously. -I'ma stay young. And the right woman will make a man out of you. That's only if she's the right woman though, all right? [Jay] Well, you know what they say, right? -Ain't no pussy like new pussy. -[Tweet] New pussy. [both laugh] I might've said that one. [men laugh] [Kurt] All right, look, I got a question for y'all, just hear me out. If a woman has a good man at home, right? She got a good man, do y'all think she still steps out? And, you know, smash somethin' on the side? Relax, Kurt. Don't nobody wanna fuck Dome-isha. [all laughing] -[Tweet] Hey, man. -[Jay] Maybe in high school. [laughing] Fuck both of y'all. [Tarron] Oh, man, say it ain't so. I mean, look, women are worse than men. We play out here, you know, but these women are winning Superbowls. You know, what goes around comes around. Karma's a bitch. A side piece is nothin' but another headache, all right? And that's a headache I do not need in my life. Besides, I love my wife. Yeah, dude, but there's a difference between love and sex, man. So, Tarron, you're happily married. That means you're not smashing no chick on the side? [Tarron] Mm-hm. Uh-oh. Nah, no, we ain't gonna do it. We ain't about to bring my personal life into this conversation. Me and my wife, we are-- [Jay] Retreat. Yeah. -[Tweet] That's a very sensitive issue. -Very. Y'all do know Tarron is a recovering coochie-holic. I'm his sponsor. -[Jay] What's that? -[laughing] Brother, I'm with you. Domino, motherfuckers. Give me my money, man. [Tweet] Wow. Shit. Hey, look. Tarron, don't forget, we got that meeting about the new club, all right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. [Tweet] What club? Well, my man Kurt over here have found a perfect location for a club. So, Kurt comes to you with an idea, you just give him a helping hand? Yo, I got ideas too, bro. [Tweet] Okay, now, let's not turn this into Shark Tank. Hey, look, come on, Jay. Everybody know you and money, man, are like water and oil. -That shit just don't mix. -[Tweet] Damn. Hey, don't patronize me, bro. I ain't patronizin' you, brother, I'm just saying. It's a grown man business. Man, fuck you, man. [Tweet laughs] [Tweet] Threw $14 on ya. -[Kurt] See, Jay, look. -So? [scoffs] You know what, man, I think you had a little too much to drink. Don't let him put his... Don't put the leather on, that's disrespectful. [Kurt] Yeah, come on, fellas. Not in my house, man. There's something I learned about the truth. [Tweet] Okay. [Tarron] That shit hurt. -[Kurt] Where you goin'? -Yeah, get your ass out of here, man. -[Kurt] Where you goin'? -[Tweet] He better be goin' to the ATM, this nigga owe me $100. -Now fuck that motherfucker, man. -[Tweet] Oh, shit. [soft R&B pop music playing] What's up, boo? What's up? It's been a whole week. I missed you. ♪ You got some ways with you ♪ You make a stay with you Yeah. I missed you too. Did you? [chuckles] ♪ 'Cause I gotta go, gotta go ♪ I gotta go, gotta go ♪ Gotta leave you alone, I can't leave you alone ♪ Hey, hold on. Is everything okay, Tarron? Yeah, yeah, everything is cool. Um, I actually brought you here just to talk. Since when? Since I decided to call it quits. [sighs] Not again. -I'm just trying to do the right thing these days. -[sighs] And what am I doin'? -The wrong thing? -I didn't say that. Got me all wet for nothin'. -Did I? -Yeah. [moans] Wait, Monica, stop. Hey, Monica, yo, stop. You're serious, huh? Hey, Monica, listen. You're pretty, you're a good person, you sexy and shit. You're everything that a guy could want. This right here is turning into me having a girlfriend with a wife on the side. [sighs] Look... I can't do this no more. So, what the fuck is this for? I got this because I wanted you to know that I wasn't using you. [scoffs] First of all, don't nobody even wear tennis bracelets anymore. -You could have at least got me a chain, Tarron. -[chuckles]. And what makes you so sure you weren't the one being used? [sighs] What am I doin'? [sighs] Yeah, your ass took that tennis bracelet. [Tarron] There was a war going on inside me, and it's like I'm just observing the battle. The right side is trying to be faithful and focus on raising my family. But the left side, it wants to enjoy all the fruits of the land, and experience all the pleasures that a young man should, to its fullest capacity. I'm praying that the right side wins. But I won't put my money on it. I need to ask you something. [phone ringing] Yes? Are you serious? [Tarron] No, you're not interrupting. Good morning. [Simon] Good morning. Yeah, we looked over your proposal and I have to say, we're very intrigued with the idea. [Tarron] Okay, that's great. Yeah, we feel it could be a very lucrative business, but your numbers are a bit inflated. [Tarron] Mm-hm. We'll have to have the 50% back on our investment 90 days after the doors open before we release the second half of the funds. Simon, I don't think that'll be a problem. Well, we have a few of the minor details that need to be worked out but I think we both feel good about where everything is right now. So? So, in short, we'd love to partner with you guys. Fantastic. We definitely look forward to being in business with you guys as well. Great. I'll have our lawyers send the revised contract and we officially have a night club. Okay. Hey, Simon? I wanna thank you for calling me personally. It means a lot. -[Simon] Talk to you soon. -All right, pal. Why are you acting so insecure? Come on, you know I have a lot going on with work right now. It's very important that that deal gets sealed. Like at what point do I become a priority again? I'm just really getting tired of taking the back seat to everything, Tarron. I just... Secret, Secret, wait. [sighs] Hey. I know that I haven't been the greatest husband lately, okay? But you know I love you, right? -It doesn't feel like it. -[scoffs] Well, I do. And you also know that we have this amazing weekend planned, New Year's Eve. No kids, no work, just us. Okay? [sighs] Don't sabotage it, okay? Have you seen my watch? [scoffs] [Tarron] Well, those numbers look great. Well, I can have the blueprint on your desk first thing in the morning. Okay? Great, well, let me give you a call back with that. All right. -[computer pings] - "I'm not sure how you can look at yourself in the mirror. You have been blessed with a beautiful family and yet you continue to shit on your blessings? Let me tell you something, karma's a ugly bitch." Karma's a bitch? "And she's gonna visit you one day soon if you keep it up." -Hey, T. -Hey, what's up, Rich? Hey, did you get that email? What email? About the meeting this morning. [scoffs] Dude, I forgot all about the meeting. But you know what? That doesn't matter as long as we have this zip drive. Well, everything's riding on you. And I know you're not 100% on board with this, but after that Smith merger didn't go through, you would've thought Mr. Gordon would have learned his lesson by now. Exactly, but you know what? We don't get paid to think, we get paid to create. [Rich] All right, rainmaker. Come on, let's... let's see what all the fuss is. How are your kids doing in basketball? Oh, they're... they're horrible. -I should've married her sister. -[Tarron laughs] -Where's Richard? -I don't know. All right, we'll get started without him, we got a lot... a lot to cover here. To be quite frank, we need to renew the Birkshaw account to secure the future of this company otherwise there are gonna be some major lay offs in the next fiscal year. To avoid that, I want you all to meet Victoria Campbell. She's here temporarily from sunny California to help us meet our projected goals in the new year, so I want everyone to make Victoria feel welcome. -Miss Campbell. -Thanks. -[clapping] -[sighs] Well, I know that we've all got work to do, so I'll keep it brief. But first, I'd like to thank Phillip for offering me such a unique opportunity and let you all know how excited I am to be joining such a distinguished, innovative group of professionals. And though our time together may be for only a season, I am truly looking forward to getting to know and work with each and every one of you. Here is to catapulting Stanton View Development into higher ground. -[clapping] -Thank you. Now hopefully, with the addition of Miss Campbell, we can all have work next year. [chuckles] Alrighty, guys, let's get this party started, shall we? [Tarron] Oh, here comes the water man. -Water man. -[phone pings] [Tarron] Water monster. [Tika] Mommy! Mommy! -Water man! -Yes. Daddy's trying... Daddy's trying to spray us. -"Daddy's trying to spray us." -You know what that means though, right? -He's trying to give you a bath. -[Tika] It's annoying me too. Well, I don't want a bath right now. -You need a little soap on that behind. -[Tika] We don't want a bath. We wanna watch TV. Don't you wanna be clean? Not really. -Terrance. -Take your dirty behind upstairs and go take a bath. -[Tika giggles] -[Secret chuckles] [Tarron] Bath time. Tarron. -[phone pings] -What up? Your phone's going off. Okay, thank you, madam secretary. [Secret mockingly laughs] [Secret] It looks like it's important. You might wanna get it. [slow, dramatic music playing] Who's texting you, Tarron? Look, I don't know who this is. Really? Because smiley face and wink emoji says that you do. Insecurity doesn't look good on you, Secret. I told you, I don't know who this is. You know what doesn't look good on you? The fact that your son can go into your phone and see pictures of all of your hoes. That doesn't look good on you. [Tarron sighs] Keep playing with me like I'm stupid. And while you're up trying to figure out who's texting you, why don't you put your kids to bed. [slow, dramatic music playing] [knocks] [door opens] I'm not interrupting you, am I? No, come in, please. [Victoria] You do have impeccable taste in architecture and design. Well, that is my job. Is that the new layout for the Birkshaw account? Uh, yes, but I haven't made my final decision. Do you mind? -Sure. -Okay. Uh... Okay, I think that if you moved this here, and then moved this right over here. Mm-hm. It comes across even more convincing. Okay. I see where you're heading with that, newbie. [laughs] It's just my opinion. Okay. How about I just move this one here and take this one and turn it that way? Hmm. The design looks cleaner, the lines are sharper, the details compliment one another, and everything appears tighter. I agree. If the looks are great, the shape will easily catch their attention. How do you come up with this stuff? I don't know, some people say it's a gift. What about you? [scoffs] I guess you could say that I'm good at spotting the finer things in life and sprinkling on my special touch. One of your obvious qualities. [chuckles] Yeah, well, you didn't have to text me back last night either. Wait, wait, that was you? [chuckles] Wow, I didn't realize that. That busy, huh? [chuckles] Oh, so Tarron is a family man? No need to answer, your eyes say it all. Well, on that note, I will thank you for allowing me to interrupt you. It gets a little boring around here at times. Well, I can't disagree with you on that. Maybe next time we can grab some lunch. You can get me up to speed on who I need to stay away from around here. [chuckles] That would be me.

Let's just not talkabout it tonight. Tarron. You can't act like there's no issues just because it's New Year's. Plus, there's something that I wanna talk to you about that's been heavy on my heart-- Babe. I wanna hear about everything that's heavy on your heart, but turn around first. [sighs] Look at my beautiful wife. [soft music playing] [Secret] What's that? [gasps] -Baby, that's beautiful. -Yeah. Oh. Here, let me put it on you. Take that up out of there. -Oh, my God. -[Inaudible] Don't worry, that's not the expensive part. -[scoffs] -[chuckles] Oh, Tarron. -Can you help me out, baby? -Yes. -Baby got all that good hair. -[Secret chuckles] -[Tarron] Got that Indian in your fam. -You so silly. -You like it? -Mm-hm. See? I still know what you like. Oh, it's perfect. -Tonight was perfect. -So are you. [soft orchestral music playing] Look. Either one of us can take the blame for how our relationship has gone.

Well, you know what they say. If it's not growing, it's dying. -Oh, that's deep. -Prolific. -That's good. -I thought of it. [laughing] Sounds like someone's very interested in my love life. [scoffs] Who might that be? Hmm. I guess you would say that my career comes first, always. The ultimate pursuit of success is an obsession of mine. Well, I could think of worse things to be obsessed with. You know, I'm looking forward to our first night together. Our first night? Our first night, yeah, Mr. Gordon sending us out of town together on business. -Right. -Yeah. Yeah, I knew what you were talking about. Uh-huh. Although I was wondering how a successful, handsome married man such as yourself could handle something like that. It is so hard, but, I have everything that I need at home. Oh, that's interesting. Yeah, you know because the experts say that most married couples are sexless at home. [Tarron] That is a very interesting theory. Did you come up with that yourself? So, I found the perfect girl's trip. When can we go? Oh, you mean like one of Tarron's fake business trips. Really, April? Oh, my God, you know, you never stop. First of all, we're not gonna sit here and talk about Tarron all night, secondly, yes, there is a small disconnect between us but me and my man, we got this, we're gonna talk about it, we're gonna get through it, okay? Thank you. -[Secret] Okay? -Mm-hm. You know what, to be honest, things feel a little different this time. Did you check his phone? What? No. Who does that? I wouldn't do that either. Why not? I would check my man's everything, if I had one. Yeah, right. [laughs] And, I would even give his ass the sniff test when something didn't seem right. -The what? -The sniff test, you know. [sniffs] -[laughing] -I can't. -Here's the check, ladies. -Thank you. What about we go to the Dominican? Right? -Are you going to join this conversation any time today? -Ever? Can you just shut up and get off the phone, please? We are trying to investigate the shadiness going on over here. You and your investigating, geez. You know what? I... I honestly don't know what I think. You know, I could be trippin', I could... it could just be my imagination, it could be absolutely nothing at all, I mean, he's got a lot of stress at work, he has the club opening. I gotta give it to him, he's trying. I mean, he got me that gorgeous necklace. He's trying. You talking about that "I'm sorry I fucked up" necklace? Please. Look. Do not listen to unhappy, no man havin' girlfriends. Misery loves company. Okay, you tried it. You did, listen. I say one more mistake, and you leave him, okay? Besides, I know you've been ready to scratch that seven-year itch. What are you talking about, April? Ain't nobody trying to scratch nothin'. You know what? Whatever. I just, I don't expect for you to understand. That's why I'm staying single. This relationship stuff is too complicated. And when I do date, I'ma get me an Armenian with that Arab money. Armenians are not Arabs, fool. They're not, stupid. But they do spend that money. [laughing] [sighs] [R&B music playing] You look good tonight. Thank you, that was really sweet of you. -What's your name? -Secret. Secret? Oh. I wonder how you got that name. [chuckles] Can I offer you a dance? Um, I'm actually here with my girls tonight, so, a girl's night out. Are you sure? I can probably, uh, show you a little something. Oh. Eh, that's really sweet of you, but... Oh. All right. No disrespect, I just... like what I see. -Nice meeting you, love. -It was nice meeting you, too. [R&B hip hop music playing] Surprise. Wow. Oh. Thank you so much for comin'. Well, thank you so much for having me. Wow, you look amazing. Well, I guess this is a little different than what you see when at the office, right? Yes, it is, I mean, I really like this ensemble on you. So, this is how you spend your spare time. I knew you had great taste the moment I stepped into your office. -Thank you so much for noticing. -Mm-hm. Figured I'd come to see you tonight since I won't be seeing you for a few days. [Tarron chuckles] What do you mean? They pulled me off the Philadelphia business trip. Really, why? [sighs] They said you were more than capable of sealing the deal. Well, they are absolutely correct. Oh, ha, ha, ha, yeah, well, I was looking forward to going. Hey, look, there's someone I would like for you to meet. Come on. Come on. Excuse us. Hey, babe. I'd like for you to meet Victoria Campbell. She works for our firm now. She came in to help us get our numbers up. She's definitely getting something up. [Victoria] Very nice to meet you. Oh, very nice to meet you too, Victoria. I've heard so much about you, I feel like I know you already. Oh? That's interesting 'cause I haven't heard anything about you. Well, you are a very lucky woman, Secret. I think we're gonna head out? Really, why so early? I mean the night is just starting. We... we've just been dancing all night and I'm a little tired. So, what time are you gonna come home? Oh, wow. I'll close up, uh, punch in some numbers, and I'll be home right after that. That's what they call it now? [R&B hip hop music playing] Pleasure meeting you, Secret. So, wait, we gotta go home and she gets to stay here with him? Did I miss somethin'? Oh. Bring your ass. [R&B hip hop music playing] Yes. So glad I caught you. Your wife left this for you earlier. -My wife? -Mm-hm. Have a nice night. [people chattering] -[elevator dings] -[Tarron] With all the madness going on in my life, I need these trips, just be by myself for a change, no children, no wife, no women, no worries.

And I might've just screwed up the biggest deal of my career. [tense music playing] [Tweet] Yeah, man, so I'm out here. I'm fuckin' with these hoes. You know what I mean, I'm doing my thing. You know what I mean? [Inaudible]. Everybody came to the spot. Yeah, there are gonna be shorties to share. Let me... let me hit you right back. [dramatic music playing] Oh. [people chattering] [soft music playing] Hey. [Secret] Can you explain this to me? Explain what? This credit card bill. [Tarron] My credit card bill? Whatever, Tarron, just, can you explain it? What do you want me to explain, Secret? I want you to explain why there's two charges on here for Georgetown Jewelers within the year and I've only received one necklace. Why are you keeping tabs on my money? The money that I bust my ass for that you don't do nothin' but sit around the house and spend. Are you serious right now? So, we're just gonna ignore the fact that I gave up everything and I've dedicated my life to raising your children properly? I take care of you and this family. I make sure you guys go without wanting anything. I make sure you straight every fuckin' day of my life and this the type of shit I gotta come home to? This is exactly what I'm talking about. This is all you do. All you do is deflect and change the subject and try to insult my intelligence. Who is the jewelry for, Tarron? I'm not about to sit here and explain myself to you. Oh, no you are gonna explain yourself. I wanna know who the bitch is. Is it the bitch at work? What the fuck are you talking about? You know what I'm talking about. Don't play me like I'm stupid. -You said it. -You so sneaky. -You said it. -Really? You know what, you fuckin' crazy. No, you know what's crazy? Is the fact that you had me meet the bitch, that's what's crazy. I guess I can ask you if you fuckin' Kurt. -What? -I heard about your little long lunch date -you guys had the other fuckin' day. -Oh, Tarron, please. -Okay. -Are you fuckin' Kurt? All right, Tarron. Can't even answer the fuckin' question. You know what, all you wanna do is assume and accuse me of shit. It's not about what I do right. It's not about what I do good. You one ungrateful little bitch. Oh, so now I'm a bitch? Don't turn away from me, Tarron, when I'm talking to you. I'ma leave, before I do exactly what you want me to do. What I want you to do? No, the reason why you're leaving is 'cause you wanna do what you wanna do, which is lay up with that raggedy bitch. But you know what, go ahead and play the little coward little boy role, that's what you do? -You know what? -What? I think we need some space. You know what? Fuck you, Tarron, and you know what? I hope the fuckin' bitch is worth it. Fuck you! [dramatic music playing] So, here is our beautiful new unit. What do you think? I like the space. And the fact that it's on a high floor works out perfect for me. I think we have a deal. -Congratulations, welcome to the building. -Thank you. Hope you enjoy the new place. All right. You have a great day. Likewise, Mr. Jenkins.

I know, I know, it seems like something's missing here, too. Hey, look, um, I've got a few things I need to take care of, so I'll give you a call later tonight, this evening. Okay, perfect. Love you too. Bye. [Tarron] Hey, who was that you were on the phone with? Oh, look at you eavesdropping. Mm-hm. Well, you know, that's not even my style. Well, someone's playing the part of Mr. Nosy today. Mm-hm. So what? You jealous? I'm sorry to disappoint you but I'm not the jealous type. You around here tip-toein' on my hardwood floors. -On your hardwood floors? -Mm-hm. Yeah, well, that was my dad, Tarron. He's coming in town for business in a few weeks. -Your dad? -My dad. I'm the only dad that you need. Besides, have you told him that you're gonna be moving in here soon? Oh. So you're finally gonna call it quits on the Jenkins residence, huh? -I just wanna be wherever you are. -Hm. So, if that's right here, then I'm cool with that. [Victoria chuckles] [soft piano music playing] [laughs] You know that what we're doing is dangerous, right? Dangerous? -Very dangerous. -Good. Very... -...dangerous. -[Tarron chuckles] Good. See you tomorrow. [Motherdear] Baby. I know you are going through a lot right now and you may not understand why this is happening to you. But I know you're a strong woman. You can handle anything that God puts in your path. [sighs] I just had a feeling that something like this would end up happening. [sniffles] I went through the same thing with Tarron's father. Both of them are just alike. Head strong, and uncompromising. He learned that from him, even how to run away from his problems. [sighs] Do you think he just woke up one day and decided he didn't love you anymore? No, no, I don't think that. Through everything I always knew that he loved me, but he did have a problem knowing how to come home at night. [scoffs] [sighs] Motherdear, I don't know what to do. I just feel like my whole life is in shambles right now. Just be there for your kids. [sobbing] I feel bad for them the most in this situation. They shouldn't have to go through this. But I also think that you and Tarron need to go somewhere to talk, put all your feelings out. I know. I sit and I think about this situation, but I just keep wondering what I could have done to have prevented this. Baby girl, let me tell you, when a man decides that it's time to get up and walk out, trust me, it has very little to do with the situation that's happening at the moment. But I will tell you this: don't keep the wrong secret from him, like I did. What do you mean? I'm saying, be honest about your role in this situation. It takes two to tango, Secret. [melancholy music playing] Lord knows. [sighs] [sighs] Secret. You're a beautiful woman, and you are a great mother. And for whatever reason y'all are going through some things right now, but he'll come around. I know my son. But, show him you're willing to fight for love. Okay? But right now, honey, you need to get up out of this house. [sighs] I don't mean you need to turn up or anything like that, but you do need to do something with this hair and go get your nails done and your feet. You look like Buckwheat's little sister. -No, I don't. -Yes, you do. I don't look like that bit, do I? You don't smell so good neither. -No. -[laughing] Honey, it's gonna be all right. -It's gonna be all right. -Oh. [inaudible]. I love you. Thank you. [sighs] Come on, Simon, it's not rocket science. You will spend the same amount of time making something that fails as you would making something that doesn't, check the stats. Personally speaking, I would much rather spend my time on something that has a higher probability of working, which is exactly why I'm here. That's great. Tarron, where'd you find her? She's brilliant. I don't know, Simon. I guess you could just say she fell in my lap. [Simon] I wouldn't mind something for my lap. Oh, I could make that happen. You know what? Slenderoni. You gonna like her. Hey, get eyes on Slenderoni. Victoria? We should talk business sometime soon. I'd like to hear more of your concepts. Absolutely.

Bro, I just came in to have a drink with my little brother. Not tonight, Jay. See, that's what I'm talking about. I come to your fine establishment to support you, and Kurt over there, and big boss man is too busy to have a drink with his brother. You think coming to my place of business, pouring liquor on the fucking floor is showing support, Jay? You talkin' about this cheap shit right here? Come on. We from the area. We can go to the liquor store and get this for $40. This ain't nothin' but a little water, man, look at that shit, heh. Come on, bro, let's go in the back and break open some of that good shit.

[Tarron] I'm cool, I just need to get some air. You wanna tell me what that was about? My brother's a fuckin' idiot. Your brother? Yeah. Tarron, baby. Look, you're gonna have to put whatever differences you guys have aside and work it out. You don't understand, it's not that easy with him. You need to relax. [heavy breathing] Feel better? -Yeah? -Yeah. I need you. -I need you. -I know. Come on, come with me. I know exactly what you need. [R&B music playing] Oh, fuck.

[Tarron] "I won't stop until you're exposed and you change. The attached pics of you and her are my proof." Fuck. Yes, can I help you? We're here to conduct a random drug test screening. Sorry, T, but, uh, after that Philadelphia episode, they insisted on this. A drug test? Has the company implemented some new policy that I'm unaware of? 'Cause if I recall, my position doesn't fall in the random fuckin' drug test category. Sir, we have our orders. I'm hoping we can just do this without a problem. Do I look like I work in the mail room? It shouldn't be anything, okay? Just standard company bullshit, you know? You know what? Let's do what you need me to do so can get back to my job. Fuckin' kiddin' me. [sighs] -Stephen, Stephen. -[Stephen] Hey. [Tarron] Hey, yo, bro, thanks for comin', man. No problem. Hey, this place looks great. You did a great job, it looks nice. Yeah, thank you, thank you, thank you. Hey, look, I know you're very busy, so, let me get right to it. What is it? Long story short, I've been getting these emails. I'm talking very elaborate emails about my marriage amongst other things. Just forward me all the emails and I'll take care of it. Cool. [Stephen whistles] That's the steeze right there. Mm-hm. Okay. What is it? Let's see it, man. Man, they gave me a random drug test at work the other day. I mean, they just came to my office, right on the spot. I don't know, it just seemed really out of the ordinary. Okay, you do drugs? [Tarron] Come on, man, no, you know I don't do drugs. What you worried about it for? I don't know, man, it just seemed weird. It just seemed like there was something more to this. Okay. I'll look into it for you. There's one other thing. About three months ago, this woman started working at my job. And I started seeing her after me and Secret separated. Is she the reason y'all separated? No. -T? -No. -It's not-- -Hey. You having sex with this woman? Yeah, of course I am. [Stephen scoffs] Look, man, but, if you don't mind, I'd appreciate if that stayed between you and I. Hey, look, man, I'm your brother in law, not your father-in-law, all right? [Tarron] Hey, I appreciate that. [Stephen] No problem, man. You forward me all those emails, and information that'll help, okay? Done. Thanks, bro, I appreciate that. -I got you. -[Kurt] Dammit! -[Stephen] I'll get back on it. -[Tarron] All right, bro. Hey, what's going on? So, you haven't seen the emails, right? -No, what emails? -We lost it. The investors, they dropped us, man. Fuck! Hold up, hold up, hold up. [tense music playing] [Secret] So this is where the devil does her dirty work. Were you up their one your knees ruining another person's marriage or just mine? What are you, stalking me? Oh, bitch, please, don't flatter yourself. The real question is what are you doing with Tarron's files? Something that obviously doesn't concern you. Look, is there a reason why you're here? Because if not, would you please move out of my way? You're good. See, you might have Tarron fooled, but you don't fool me one bit. Honey. I am not gonna stand here and fight you over a man who has clearly made his choice. I'm here, you're not. [scoffs] See, what you don't know about my husband, Victoria, is that Tarron likes to play in the mud from time to time. You think you're special? Maybe if you played your position a little better, you wouldn't have that problem, now would you? -[slaps] -[Victoria gasps] You're not the first, but you will be the last. -[Victoria] Is that a threat? -No, it's a promise. You stay the fuck away from my husband. -Game on, bitch. -[Secret] Try me, bitch. [laughs] [Victoria] So on. [dramatic music playing] Fuck, pick up, Tarron. Phillip's on his way down. Dude, you're not gonna believe this. I cannot find my drive. [sighs] [dramatic music playing] What's going on? Your drug test came back positive. Two illegal substances in your bloodstream. Nembutal and an amphetamine. Come on, Rich, that's crazy. All right, you know me, I'm not on these type of drugs, and I know I passed that bogus-ass drug test. Rich, you know... You know what, this is ridiculous. Let me talk to Phillip. [sighs] Hey, Phillip, what's going on? Tarron, I can't believe you let me down like this. Phillip, you know me. You know I'm not on any type of drugs. Tarron, the test says something different. You've been slipping. You were late for one of our most important deals, causing us to lose that account. We find the drive that you said was stolen, but all the drawings were missing. I put my faith in you, and you let us all down. Phillip, Phillip, can't you see that this all so-- Don't make this anymore difficult than it has to be. I really wished I could believe you. Phillip, you know me. You know I'm not... Get your fuckin' hands off me. This is me, Phillip. Rich, what... So, that's what we doin'? Fuckin' wild. I'll walk out on my own. [dramatic music playing] [Tarron] This is one of those moments where a man has to finally wake up. Hey. What's up bruh? Are you sure you wanna see this? Look, I'm a big boy, I can handle it.

[chuckles] Look, Secret, I'm sorry. Can we go in the house and talk? Now is not a good time Tarron. Why not? Where are the kids at? They're at your mother's, and I'm on my way out. [laughs] So I come to talk to you, and you goin' out on a date? [scoffs] Are you serious? First of all, I didn't even know that you were on your way, and secondly, you have a lot of nerve.

Just... just come if you guys can come, it's okay. No. -Tarron just got here, I'm gonna give you a call back. -[Tarron] Hey. Okay. I love you, too. What's up? -What's up, man, thanks for comin'. -[Tweet] No doubt, no doubt. Jay, girls. Hey, so, what did they say? I don't know but they said that Terrance was riding his bike and he got hit by a car, so they rushed him here. They've been in there ever since and they won't tell us anything. Look, I'ma go try to get an update, okay? [sighs] [Inaudible]. -[doctor] Mrs. Jenkins? -Yes. [doctor] Your son is in our SICU right now being monitored by our top surgeons. Terrance may have internal bleeding which may require a blood transfusion. -Okay, okay, okay. -[Secret sobs] [Tarron] All right, all right. So, doc, what do you need from us? In the circumstances like these, we ask all family members to get tested for blood donor match, unless you already know who may be a match? I'm not sure, but we'll take whatever tests you need for us to take to find out who's compatible. [doctor] Great, we can do one by one, starting with you, Mrs. Jenkins. -Can you follow me? -Yeah. [Tarron] Come here. [dramatic music playing] It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. [machine beeping] Great news, Mr. Jenkins, you're a perfect match. O-positive, just like your son. Well... Wait, wait. What do you mean? I'm AB-negative. We can retest but results confirm that Mr. Jenkins is O-positive. Well, doctor, there must be some mix up with the charts. I'm Mr. Jenkins, but I'm AB-negative. We can retest if you'd like us to do that, but the results confirm that Mr. Jason Jenkins is a match. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up. Secret, please tell me you don't know what the fuck she's talking about. [shouts] Answer me! Can we go somewhere and talk? [dramatic music playing] Not Jay. Fuckin' Jay? Can we have a minute, please? Yes, but we need to make a decision immediately. -Baby, I never meant to hurt you-- -[Tarron] Oh, fucking Jay? How you gonna fuck my brother? It's not what you think, Tarron. -Fucking Jay? -[Secret] Tarron. Tarron, no! Tarron! [dramatic music playing] [Tarron] You knew this, didn't you? You knew this the whole fuckin' time, didn't you? -What you talkin' about? -[shouting] -Hey, chill! -[Kurt] What are you doin', man?

I guess when the little head is thinking for the big head, what would you expect? How could I have been so stupid? -How is he? -Still sleeping. So where do we go from here? I don't know, Secret. I mean, I'm still trying to wrap my head around the fact that my son is really my nephew. He is and will always be your son, Tarron. How could you keep something like this from me for so long? It wasn't my intention. It happened before I even met you. I met Jay at a bar on Georgetown campus graduation week. We got really drunk and we had sex that one time. I never saw Jay again until after we were married. Terrance was born, and when I found out that Jay was your brother, I was just too ashamed to tell you. He can never find out about this. So what about her? Do you still love her? [sighs] No. I never loved her. I'm really sorry that I kept something like this from you. I just never wanted to tear our family apart. Look who's waking up. Hey, buddy. How you feelin', champ? I feel okay. Look, you get you some rest, all right? As much rest as you need. And your mother and your father are here for you. All right? [phone ringing] Hello? Yeah. No, I can be there in like 30 minutes. Yeah, Terrance, he just woke up. Yeah, he's doin' fine. He's just gonna need some rest. Mm-hm. All right, I'll see you in a few. -Hey, ma. -Jesus, boy. When's the last time you had a meal? Come on, ma, I'm juggling a lot right now. [sighs] I'm trying to make sense of my crazy life. [chuckles] Life. It'll teach you the hardest lessons. I don't know, ma. Like my life is just completely falling apart. I hope you ain't coming here crying to me 'cause if you're looking for a pity party, you can just keep on steppin'. -[Tarron] But, ma-- -But nothin'. All of this is your fault, Tarron. Secret loves you more than anything in life, and your brother does, too. If that's love, then I don't want any part of it. Dammit, Tarron. You need to go someplace and take a good, long look in a mirror. You are far from being a saint. You're lucky that girl didn't leave you years ago. Most dependable person you know has made mistakes before. Nobody is perfect. [Tarron] Yeah, ma, I know. I don't know, it's just gonna be real hard to trust after all this. Do you remember your 10th birthday party? Back when we lived in Suitland? I spent all morning making you a birthday cake and I put so much love into it and everything that you loved into it, and then your father showed up with a big, pretty cake from the store. Had all the cartoon characters and whatnot. [scoffs] It made my little cake look like a piece of shit. [laughs] Yeah, ma. I remember that. -[Motherdear] You do? -Yeah. So then what happened? As good as his cake looked on the outside, when we ate it, it tasted nasty. That's right. And now every birthday you ask your wife to make you that same cake that I made you. [sighs] It's my favorite. What looks good to the eye is not always good for the heart. Hey, ma. Thank you. Tarron, sit your ass down. You are not going anywhere. You are not doing the same thing your father did. You are not runnin'. What is he doing here? Well, the last I checked, this was my house, and he's as welcomed here as you are. Look we are a family, and that is never gonna change. You boys need to go outside and settle your differences. [Tarron] No, ma. -I don't have nothin' to say to him. -[Jay] T. Yo, hear me out, T. Hey, Tarron. Hey, T! Come on, man, hear me out. Come on, man, look. Look, I had no idea about that shit about Terrance man. I'm just as shocked as you. Really? Tell me, Jay, how is that possible? Okay, maybe not as shocked as you. But I never knew that what happened between me and Secret resulted in Terrance being my son. So what, Jay? Hmm? You want some type of sympathy from me? No, that's not what I'm saying. So, what are you saying? Look. When... When dad left us, I made it my responsibility to raise you. I taught you how to catch a football, you became all American. I taught you how to tie a tie, you bought three suits. I taught you how to drive, you got a fuckin' BMW. You also taught me how to wipe the tears from our mother's eyes, every time that you messed up or went to jail. So, yeah, technically you taught me how to man up. But everything that I have, everything that I got, I worked for. So, tell me, Jay, what does my success have to do with us? 'Cause you're my little brother. My little brother. And after a while, I looked up to you. I wanted to be you. Yo, is that shit enough for me? That didn't mean nothin' to me. I didn't care about none of that. You put that between us. Look, I was supposed to step up and be the man of the house-- Yeah, but what was good for me was good for all of us. That was your ego. That was your ego fuckin' up your head. -Ego? -[Tarron] Ego. Don't even go there 'cause it's your ego why we in this bullshit right now 'cause... Look. I never wanted to disrespect you. I was acting like a fuckin' idiot. But let me tell you this, what happened between me and Secret, it was just a one time thing, a silly game of Truth or Dare-- Yo, yo, yo, Jay, save it, man. I done heard it one too many times, man. Save it. [clicks tongue] I just don't know with you, man. I mean, it's always somethin'. So what, Jay? I'm supposed to start believing in you? Start putting my faith in my big brother again? Tarron, you're a grown man, I can't tell you what to do. You do what you wanna do. [dramatic music playing] You do what you wanna do. But I came here to talk to you face to face, man to man. No lying, no animosity. I just want to be that... that reliable brother that I always should have been. Right. So, how do I know there's not something else that you're keeping from me? That's it. There's nothin' else. I promise on my life, T, there's nothin' else. So, what about the emails? I know you had somethin' to do with that. Emails? I don't even know how to work a computer, what are you talking about? [phone ringing] Hey, yo, Kurt, what's up? Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. No, I can be there in like 30. All right. Hey, man, I gotta go. Tell ma I had to leave. I'll call you later. [Tarron] Kurt. What's so important that I had to rush over here? There's something that we wanna show you. This should be good. [dramatic music playing] So the day that Kurt and I met, when you were out of town, I was asking him to keep a close eye on Victoria. [Kurt] After Secret and I met, Secret asked me to pull the surveillance footage from the other night when you and Jay got into it. This is what I found. [dramatic music playing] [slams] I guess this is where you guys can say, "I told you so." No. Just thank me later. [sighs] [scoffs] [knocks] [Tarron] Got a minute? How did you get in? Managed to keep a few friends in a few places. I wanna say I like what you've done with the place, but... I guess you did your best. Tarron, I know. I know how much it hurts when you are so used to being the player and suddenly you're the one who's getting played. [laughs] Oh, man, do you wanna know what the funniest part about this whole thing is? What's that? The fact that I knew you were an easy target from the moment I laid eyes on you. The ones who think with their dicks, are always easy. Look, Victoria, you have a family and so do I, so I'm not mad at you about that. We both got what we wanted. Let's just leave it at that. Family? Wait a second, are you referring to the same family that you left for me? Tarron, you are nothin' but a weak, pathetic loser of a man. Just goin' around trying to perpetrate as if you're the world's greatest husband with a perfect life and wife when deep down inside, you know how arrogant and sorry your ass really is. Fuck that. There's rules to this shit, Victoria. You didn't just try to take my position. -You tried to destroy my life. -It was business. You trying to play checkers with a chess master, baby. Oh, you know what, if I could have been [inaudible], the morning that you had to take the drug test and swore that you were clean. Just brilliant. [laughs] Oh. You know, for some reason, people often overlook the most fucked up part about playing games, Miss Chess Master. Oh, really? Somebody got to lose. -[phone pings] -A message. [dramatic music playing] [Tarron scoffs] [Tarron] Checkmate, bitch. Uh. [clears throat] [Tarron] Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this. [Victoria] Get your fuckin'4 hands off of me! Get off of me! I need to speak to a fuckin' attorney! You will have more than enough time to talk to your attorney. Man, it's so hard to hire good help nowadays. Tarron, I thought you had made a big mistake. Turns out I had. Meet me in my office tomorrow morning? [dramatic music playing] [car door opens] -What's up Stephen? -Hey, T. Hey. I done found out who been sending you them damn emails. Man, I don't even think I wanna know who been sending out those emails. Motherdear. -No. -[Stephen chuckles] No, there's no way. Motherdear been sending you those emails, man. [Tarron] Wow. Are you fuckin' kidding me? You should have seen my face when I found out. [both laugh] But on the real though, T. I know Doris and I, we are not the most exciting couple. No, you're not. I know. But at the end of the day, I sacrifice a lot of fun to keep my home tight. Always keep your home tight. Man. Hey, man, thanks for everything. [Stephen] I got you. -Hit me up any time. -All right. You playin' ball this weekend? Yeah, I'm hoopin'. [Tarron] Them little old knees you got. Yeah. Hey, yo, hook me up with that talent.
