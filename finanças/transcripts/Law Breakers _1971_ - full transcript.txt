Slept well? Get dressed! - Why? - It's cold outside. What has he done? He didn't tell you? What a naughty boy! Tell her... I don't know what they want, Genevieve. He isn't awake yet! Hurry up! That's it... now your shoes. What do you want from me? I retired a long time ago. There's a reason if we come here at 8:00 am. - We'd like to sleep too. - Mummy... Mummy... You're ready! Take a coat, it's cold outside. You forgot something, Sogeat. - Your cufflinks! - You're crazy! Bye Mrs. Sogeat. Sorry for disturbing you. You've done it again, Sogeat? Couldn't you keep quiet? - He doesn't know why he's here. - Really? I'm not impressed. You've made no progress since last time. - You left prints on the desk. - What desk? That's enough now! Loubet Garage is where you work. There's a safe behind the desk. It was cracked on Sunday. Like the one from Bandin five years ago. You still... use the same method! I don't see the connection. - Where were you on Sunday? - Mind your own business. - You're getting on my nerves! - Where were you? - At the garage. - We know that! - I had an engine to finish. - And a safe to open? What's all that shit? I didn't go to the office. What about the fingerprints? Is there a date with them? I touch that desk every day. He's making fun of us! Enough now! Don't touch me! That's enough now! Enough! Very well... LAWBREAKERS Merry Christmas. Good morning, Moulard. Good morning, your Honor. You seem happy today. If I didn't have a vacation coming in six days... I'd go out of my mind! But what do you know? You're always cheerful. Did you summon the witnesses in the drugstore case? For the day after tomorrow. Talking of vacations, President Duverger would like to see you. - Is he in a hurry? - I think it's urgent! - You know what he wants? - No. And you? Maybe we both know! The widow filed a complaint... She's waiting next door... As a Christmas gift, I'd rather have a box of cigars but... Anyway, you've been chosen. But, President, such a case... should go to the dean. Regnard is awkward and stubborn. We thought about Dumar but he's a lamb howling with the wolves. We need someone who can twist the knife but... bend to our will, understand? You want a wolf who bleats with the lambs. - Specifically when the lambs are... - Pigs! Honest scrupulous workers who live to serve the public. They are our best allies. Can we see the widow? If you want. Who do you want for the autopsy? - Dr. Sabatier. - Wouldn't you prefer... - Dr. Sabatier. - Well... all right. They killed him, sir, they killed him... They took him at 8 am, at noon they brought a corpse back. Conduct an inquiry. Judge Level has been assigned. What a clot of blood! Brain damage with internal bleeding. Now the inner ear... Right side broken... Carotid broken too... That's a mess! I've seen enough. Have it ready for tomorrow. Ready for the trash can! Mine... not yours of course! You buy the good stuff and give me the rotten ones! Just rent a pair. Why don't I rent a fishing rod? - I won't break my leg! - We'll have time to talk... We'll leave in a week if we are going... What do you mean by that? You are going, but me... You're not going to do that? You think I want to? When will you know? In three minutes exactly. No, I was waiting for your call. Brain trauma... Tell me the truth, doctor... They beat the shit out of him? You have no doubt. Thanks. Send it first thing tomorrow. Is he the guy who died at the police station? You're handling the case? That's great! That's your opinion. You don't have to tell your friends what's happening here. I don't want students in my way. They all talk about it now! I hope you'll hang those pigs! Next time I need advice, I'll ask you... OK? They'll tell you lies. They'll tell you the guy hit his brain killing a mosquito! - If you believe them... - That's enough! A smartass like you isn't going to teach me my job! I'm sorry. I'd like you to understand. This type of case... is the worst thing... that can happen to a judge. I'm not joking. I'm sure you'll be perfect. Thank you. Take my skis. It's a gift. We weren't that gentle. But hitting him... I wouldn't compromise a career hitting a suspect. You admit you didn't have too much against him. Except he confessed to an identical crime five years ago. But this time he denied it. You know they always do... We're in the same type of job. We don't have the same methods. Let's say they go together. We cops clean up the shit. I've never seen a judge unhappy to get a confession. - Let's go back to Sogeat. - I know he is still guilty. That's not the question, he is dead now. We want to know how he died, and you know the answer. These autopsy reports are all greek to me. To you we're in the same bag? Yes, we have the same enemies. Those who might use this case to attack the system. It's a tough game to play. I'd sooner be in my shoes than yours. - To be frank, so would I. - We both agree! Your deposition. - Won't you read it? - I trust you... completely. I want to see where it happened. Anytime you want... My police station is at your disposal. Come in, please. Sit down. Edward Radu, married, 4 kids, 42 years old, 15 years in the ranks. Military honors, 4 times in Indochina and Algeria, your Honor. I suppose I should congratulate you. But it... tells me that you should be quite used to violence. Me, violent! Excuse me. Didn't you shake Sogeat up a bit? We didn't touch one hair on his head. Word of honor! And with us, honor still means something. Good. Just sign. Is it all right? For Pete's sake! They think we're idiots. - What do you think? - I never think. Just a thin wall separates us from the main office. If he had been hit someone would have heard him. I mean the guard: La Tuile. He was on duty December 18 and those two birds... I brought them back to answer your questions. So except the guard, and... Vericel, a burglar, and Beauvoisin, a bum... - There was nobody else here? - Nobody. Perfect. I didn't hear a thing and I have a good ear. How did you know my question? How do you know who I am? And you? I was asleep. I always sleep in jail. What else can you do? I'd like to see them at my office. Why not mine? We can do it right now. It's best for everyone. - Who do you want first? - Your choice. I know your name. This isn't your first time? Once you've done one bad thing... they'll take you in for anything. - How can we get out of it? - So... - The police hassled you? - You can say that again! But judges can be worse... it's they who set sentences. I advise you to tell the truth... Or you'll be sorry when I see you in court! The interrogation went from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm... Did you hear anything? Yes or no? - In a police station... - Yes or no? - Well... yes. - Write! - You've heard screams. - Well... more like loud voices. But if you want to call that screams, I don't mind. - Any groans? - Even with a good ear... Now that I think of it... I've heard a chair being... dragged across the floor. When they brought Sogeat back to his cell, you were there? - Yes, your Honor. - How was he? He was not laughing but he was all right. - You've been grilled before? - More than my share! - How was it? - With me it's different. I plead guilty right away so they can't do a thing. - Anyway, I don't know how to lie. - I can see that. Just sign your deposition... and get out of here. It's maybe because of the decor, but you questioned him... like a cop, not a judge! What are you getting at? It's not my business, I know. Can I come in? Beauvoisin Ernest, unemployed and proud of it. So, you were asleep? Yes, lying on the bench. I had to be tired with all that noise! - What noise? - The cars in the street. That's why I live in the country but in the winter, you know... You slept for three hours without interruption? I'd still be there if that whore hadn't kicked me out. - What whore? - Eh? Was anyone with you, apart from Vericel? Wait... I got mixed up with another occasion. Show me the books for December 18. Do what the judge tells you. There are three names! You're right... I forgot her. She's here so often... She's part of the furniture. So I have to question the furniture! They have three days to find her! Or I'll accuse them of hiding witnesses. One more count against them. I don't know if you're questioning the furniture, but... you beat up my ornaments. I'm really sorry. - Can I glue it back together? - No, darling. It doesn't matter. Come... Sit down. What is it? I don't know. I found it in the fireplace. - Don't you like it? - I decided to stop smoking. You say that twice a month. I'm really an ass. We can't go skiing. I forgot your... Christmas gift, and I break everything in sight. - Francois sent me a card. - Happy New Year, kids! There's no more respect. He writes like shit. When is the wedding? That's what I call taste... You have to tell him divorce isn't that easy in Italy. But now we've got a chance! Yes, your Honor. Isn't it wonderful? Three men who catch crooks. And they're about to be arrested themselves. Think about something else. It's Christmas after all. Do you think it's Christmas for them? Go play next door. Don't touch him! What do you want? We were in the neighborhood... for an investigation. - Nothing really important. - An investigation? We've got to know how your husband died. It's our job. So question yourself! Don't get excited, Mrs. Sogeat. We understand, you're upset. It's a little easy... You file a complaint and get compensation... Do you think we'll let you do that? You were unwise. Very unwise. Get out! - Get out now or... - Or what? You call the police? You're not very polite. We're here to help you. The truth never hurts anyone. What do you want to know? Did your husband drink? - It's important in case... - Never! Really? He used to stop every day at the local bar. - The owner just told us. - Just a drink now and then. You see... you speak too fast. Do you want me to say he was a drunkard? - Some say so... - Who? Name one if you can. Gosselin, the grocer. One night in May, I drove him home... he was completely drunk. - So? - His best friend's wedding... - Everybody was high! - I told you! You speak too fast. They stayed about an hour. It was awful. - Did you sign anything? - I wanted them to go... - To be left alone... - It's clear. If he was... a drunkard, he could have died of a cerebral hemorrhage. Nice work, don't you think? Intimidation, threats... blackmail, they have it all! You'll plead later. They haven't been indicted yet. What are you waiting for? Really? Want to trade places? You'd be better than me! Think so... really? I won't insist! Commissioner Bertrand? Judge Level here. Glad to hear you. I wanted to wish you Merry Christmas. - And a Happy New Year. - Thank you. - Did you find that witness? - Not yet. We've tried, but you know these girls... - here today, gone tomorrow. - I refuse to believe that... a hooker on file can vanish without a trace! We've seen worse... I've done everything in my power but... It's ill-timed. Our workload is so heavy at this time. Bad timing... sure... Good news. You can stop looking for her. You don't want to hear her? She's here! Please sit down. I've been expecting you... - for ten days. - But... There's no reproach. You came on your own. I felt guilty. On Christmas Eve, I couldn't stop thinking about Sogeat. Let's start at the beginning. You were at the police station. - During the interrogation? - Interrogation? They didn't bother, your Honor. It was a massacre. - Cowards! - You talk too much. I'm innocent, I swear it, on my boy's head! You're stubborn, but we're stronger than you! - Bastards! - I'll teach you manners! Don't you think that's enough? Don't bother! He'll be beaten to a pulp! It's none of your business! Don't you think they're excited enough? I'm innocent! Confess, damn it! Or we'll break you in pieces. Stop it, you bastards! Shut up! Take him. We'll finish him later. Come to my office, Radoux. Guard! Take care of him. Aren't you ashamed? You want some, it's free! - I told you so. - Come with me... - Get up, you! - What is it? Don't worry, you'll recover. At least you didn't give in. Two against one! I hope you get a raise! Stay with us. Say something. My head... my head... It's not a joke anymore. You should call a doctor. Tell the commissioner. He took us in his office when the ambulance had gone. He gave us a speech. We saw nothing, heard nothing. He told me to take off. That's all. In my job, you don't want to annoy the police. But... but it was Christmas. Thank God! You'll repeat all that in front of them. - Can you do it? - They don't scare me... - Now that you're here. - Well, you know... You'll be alone. You're never alone when you tell the truth. Think so? They taught me that in school. That's funny, me too. You're right. At least, there will be two of us. The guard was here. Vericel, Beauvoisin... in here... - And you? - Standing over there. Wait next door, please. - You, commissioner... - He kept going in and out... Don't speak unless I ask you. But why? Since she saw... heard, and understood everything? Miss, you are the only one of these four people... who heard screams, blows and cries for mercy. - Do you still say that? - You bet I do! - Your Honor... - Wait! - You still say you were asleep? - Yes. - You saw and heard nothing? - Absolutely. - There were no cries or yells. - Liar! What do you have to say? She was making all the noise. Every time she comes here, she breaks everything! I remember now, she was doing all the screaming. And with good reason, you heard it too, coward! - Be polite! - You're on their side, I know. - He's a stoolpigeon! - Listen to the whore! They're your witnesses against us? I take what I find... I don't have your means of finding the truth. Nor the same methods. Let's start when you brought Sogeat out. May I speak? - The guard carried Sogeat. - Carried! How could you know? He carried him. Sogeat couldn't even stand. - Did you hear, commissioner? - I'm not deaf or blind. I see how biased your "inquiry" is. Please be more precise. It's normal for a hooker to want revenge on us... but not for you to believe her crap! I know you tried to help me not to get that crap... by sending her away and hiding her name from me. If it becomes a personal matter, I'll know how to defend myself. Excuse me, I have work to do. - Can I say something? - Please do. She's right. She heard noises... screams even... He insulted us. We answered back. How, with your fists? No, with words. Words didn't kill him. You did. You're a sadist! Be quiet! - You'll get yours in court! - Court, my ass! He's one of my clients. After his visits, I'm all bruises. Be quiet! - She's nuts... - You too! Should I write all that? - Are you going to indict them? - I haven't decided yet. - When will you know? - Two days at the most. What do you think of the student protest? I disapprove of it. Everyone in front of City Hall tomorrow for the march. - We have to go. - Tomorrow at noon. - Why not the police station? - Or the courthouse? We start from City Hall. The cops will stop you. They won't arrest you anyway, we all know that! Here's Level! Will your father go for it, or... He doesn't keep me informed. Case dismissed, ten to one! - He's no fighter. - You don't know him! Judges always back up the cops. They never change. And favors must be returned! When my father starts a thing he goes all the way! Yes, but which way? - Your Honor, what a pleasure. - Good day. - What brings you here? - An important case. - Which one? - Can't you guess? Bertrand, Radoux and Bonetti have asked me... to defend them. - But they're not indicted yet! - That's what worries them. - I don't understand. - Allow me... For over two weeks an accusation has hung over their heads. With every hour, the public suspects them more... and you are the main cause of this. - Me? - Yes, you! Instead of leading... an ordinary inquiry, you surround yourself with mystery. Only hints and innuendos come from your office. Let's fight it out in the open. I officially request... that you indict them. So you attack, for a better defense. We only want a fair fight. Maybe you're not strong enough to fight us. Then... - Then? - Dismiss the case. - It's so much simpler. - I see! How ingenious. If you ask for the indictment... - you win the first round. - I'm not that devious. All I want is to shed light on the truth. Count on me, you'll see the light. You might even get blinded! My eyes have seen a lot! This is a live report on the student demonstration... A huge body of policemen confronts the students... The students are shouting and waving banners. The first stone has been thrown! They're all getting into it! The police counter-attack... What is it? - What's wrong? - Nothing... I need to breathe... some fresh air. One breath, then I'll go. That's better. - Did you have lunch? - I'm not hungry. They hired Graziani. Who is he? One of the best lawyers in the country. Is it bad? Yes, but exciting! - I'm starting to get interested. - How come? On my left is Rivette, a novice. On my right, Graziani, the champ! And you, in the middle! It's a game with no rules. Even for the referee! If they could hear me! That's me. Yes, he's here. Just a minute. - It's for you. - Nobody knows I'm here! Commissioner Bertrand. I'm sorry to disturb your privacy, but... I've tried to reach you at your office and at home. - As it is an important matter... - Important? I'm coming. Twenty francs, please. But I know you! I've seen you on television. Germaine, come here! I'm in a rush, please. That's a surprise. What is it? He's the judge. In the paper! Go get the kids. He'll give them an autograph! Here, thanks! What about the oil? And the water? He's full of himself, who does he think he is? The man who's going to jail three cops. I wish I could spare you this grief, I'm a father too... I understand your feelings. Follow me. I'll leave you two alone. Thanks! Thanks a lot! See the situation you put me in? Couldn't you stay quiet? You had to go with your friends. I told you. - You don't know everything. - What do you mean? What is it? Speak up! - They found grass on me. - Grass? - Some hashish. - What? Clever, eh? What do you mean, clever? You're slow. After the arrest, they searched us and found... the drug on another guy. When we got here, surprise! They found it in my coat. Now do you see it? I hope you believe me... or we'll never make it. Who searched you? One of the inspectors - the short one. Bastards! We can't prove a thing. It's two years in jail... maybe a pardon. They expect you to throw in the towel. Your future's at stake. Don't give up the fight! I don't understand this generation. Look at them... they have it all... they want more... What? Who knows? We were not angels either! Personally, I will forgive. Let them all go. This one too. Forgiveness is a great virtue. Isn't it, your Honor? Judge Level Indicts The Three Policemen. Let's say my clients are guilty for the sake of argument. Good. Now, who killed Sogeat? Commissioner Bertrand? Inspector Radoux? Inspector Bonetti? You have to make a choice. Sometimes there's no suspect. Here we have three... That's two too many! The inquiry will answer this question. You're jumping the gun. We're not in court yet. I hope we never get there. For us as well as for you. For me? Why for me? I don't think you'll be forgiven for indicting us. I'll be the judge of that. And I take the responsibility. You've hired an excellent lawyer. You can be sure he'll do all he can... - Right! - I didn't ask you! You are free to go and perform your usual duties. Under the condition that you will appear anytime we call. That's it. That's all for today. That's it? Why don't you throw us in jail? Why don't you go all the way? - Mr. Radoux! - I'll say what I have to say! Take me to court! When I risk my life every day! I warn you, you'll be sorry! - You're just a bastard! - Typist! Write down the insults and threats the accused just said. No! And you... calm down! Please forgive my client. For 15 years he's risked his life for his country. I personally insist... Glad to oblige. Thank you. We are all men of good will. Why do we have to fight? Why don't you ask your clients? I'll meet your witnesses, starting on Monday. Good day, gentlemen. We'll see each other by the end of the month. All right? - I'm in no rush. - I am! You must admit not all cops are like Radoux and Bonetti. - It's the Commissioner too. - So he helps his helpers... It's been like a rule since the war. Look at Vietnam - there's crime everywhere. Where would we be without the police? For you the question is: Where would Vietnam be without the Green Berets? What would the world be without violence? I'm foolish enough to believe... that the world would be better. I agree that violence is the worst answer to violence. Give us a chance to find new weapons. We don't make fighters in our police academies. One day a small-town cop strikes a blow. It's easier. He never learned another way. Should we ruin the reputation of the police for one guy? Should we have double standards? One for the police and another for the public. We're talking about a murder! No... just an accident... A tragic blunder. Remember the occupation... The Allies were bombing occupied territories... killing women and children... Without these dead women and kids... we would never have been freed from the Nazis! You really enjoy these wartime analogies. Supposing you're right... what do you want from me? To give up this case. Here it comes! First, it's the best thing for the victim's family. And then? I assure you, ample compensation will be paid... to the widow and her son. I didn't think this visit was official. I talked with the Chancellor before I left. Think about it. You're not sure you'll prove their guilt. If they're acquitted, there will be no compensation. I hate to say this but... That sounds like blackmail! They said you were tough. I haven't always been. At first I would have liked to avoid this trial. But then I realized something. Yes, those thugs are exceptions. But if they were the only bad cops on earth... they should still be crushed like the deadliest serpents. Otherwise what kind of future are we giving our children? Tough and idealistic! Do you want to know what I think? You'll be surprised. Though I'm a cop, I believe idealists are needed... in our future. Don't quote me, it would be bad for me. The inspectors came to see you, Mr. Cassot? On Christmas day, your Honor. They came right after the holiday. Where is that paper? It seems you witnessed an accident involving Mr. Sogeat... the day before he died. Well, hardly an accident. Let's say an incident. Tell me exactly what happened. It's important. It's very simple... Here comes Santa Claus... Santa Claus is broke! Totally broke! Give me a drink. What happened? 250 francs for an electric train! - You think too big! - We always spoil the kids. What can I do? He's my only child. - And he's so cute! - So don't complain! His mother told him, "you're so cute that when you..." grow up all the girls will run after you." And he said, "I'll run faster than them." He's as witty as his father! Nothing I can do about it! It's my round. No thanks. I have to hide this lot before he gets home. Can't you pay attention? Didn't you see the red light? I stopped. So why are you complaining? I should maybe thank you for not running me over? And send your wife flowers? When he came home he was angry... because the gifts were all dirty. We had to wrap them again. And his clothes? Were they stained? - No. - Take this down: Clothes were not dirty, torn or wrinkled. - Is that right? - Yes. Why? Nothing. Thank you. Your turn! Take a seat. I swear to tell nothing but the truth. It's not enough to swear. You have to tell the truth! I already gave a deposition. In front of your boss... But he's not here now. So... that famous truth... It's now or never. I'm listening! Try to understand... Your turn, Marco. How are you, Radoux? Fine. And you? One survives. I have to talk to you. - Now? - Yes. Can't you see I'm busy? - How long? - Five years minimum. Hi there! Shall I drive you home? I have my car. It broke down. - A cigarette? - No thanks. - So Graziani's against you... - He's a superb lawyer. I studied with him. He taught me a lot. You'd better remember it all. He's tough. - I'm not scared. - You should be. I have a secret weapon for you. It'll work... if you use it well. Have you read the guard's deposition? What do you think of it? It's all too simple: He heard and saw nothing. You have to read between the lines. Didn't Graziani teach you that? The guard's a decent man who's out of his depth. He's torn between honesty and loyalty. In my office he chose loyalty. In court he'll react differently. You think he'll be scared? He'll be under oath, facing his country's justice. You will have to jolt his memory... and make him tell the truth. Be melodramatic. He'll give way if you know how to pressure him. That's all. - Thank you, sir. - For what? - I haven't said a thing. - For driving me home. Think we have enough? I bought the usual amount. I've been looking for you since this morning. Can't it wait til tomorrow? What is it? I like your boat. What's happened? - They arrested Marco. - Marco? My man. He may get 5 years. I had to decide... I can't help you anymore. You were nice to me so I came to tell you. You signed your deposition. I'll say I misunderstood, that you intimidated me. Why not say I hit you? Do you think I like it? I'm not good at speeches... Your conscience must be bothering you... I can't afford a conscience. - Listen! - No! Goodbye. You're my only witness. If you go I lose the case. I'm no Joan of Arc. I don't have to fight for the cause! Maybe you're right. You see. We're all free to choose... even to choose cowardice. My choice is simple. Marco is all I have in the world. Mrs. Sogeat had only one husband. I can't bring him back. Every man for himself and the devil take all! Get your pimp out of jail! Now leave me alone! Wait! Don't be angry. I'm lost... What would you do? I'm lost too. We are only pawns. What's important is Dignity... Freedom. Any word you write with a capital. The trouble with those words is... - I sound dumb saying them. - You're wrong, your Honor. Do you understand what they mean? You're no Joan of Arc and I'm no Robin Hood, but... it's because a few people in history said "no" to tyranny... that we now have freedom... almost, anyway. - I didn't see that. - Tyranny is like... a dragon's head that always grows back... We must stick together against all odds... We can't give up, ever... Or there's no more hope. Don't worry, I won't give up. Are you sure? I swear it! You can count on me. - And Marco? - Oh, him... He never spoke to me like that. I needed a man like you! Who was she? You know... it's funny! I don't know if I'm a good magistrate... But I just found out... I would have been a good pimp! Will it be ready by Easter? It just needs painting. You can do some! - How's the investigation? - It's going fine... Yesterday I saved a first-rate witness! - How are you, Laura? - Hi, Francois! What did you say? I'll tell you later. - We'll get them. - Yes, darling. I have a customer. - Bye, my beauty. - See you Thursday. - Very nice! - A Chinese incense burner. - A remarkable piece. - You're a connoisseur. - How much is it? - 12,000 francs. - You mean a million. - It's a collector's item. Do you have many collector's items? Oh, I have a bit of everything. Where did you get this? - I bought it. - From whom? The person who sold it. Do you have their name? What's that to you? Item 692... item 195... - It's a good start! - It depends for whom! For Justice, your Honor. I care about nothing else. I have no doubt! - May I compliment you? - You're too kind! You've constructed a brief out of thin air... like Mozart's music: Light, ethereal... and brittle. You can't have everything. Why not! Mr. Molard will give you the rest of the music. - What happened? - They came to my shop. So, my friend, we're going to fence with each other? Yes, boss! And I intend to give you a hard time. You went to the best school! It's a big chance for you... An orphan and a widow... - What could be better? - If you win! - Otherwise... you're dead! - I intend to win! You're young enough to have illusions, but... the case for the prosecution is not very strong. - We have a secret weapon... - Interesting... - So do we. - May the best man win. - Like the races. - Exactly. Bye. Are you in a rush? I like your enthusiasm. We don't have it anymore. Just lots of worries. You know what I have to deal with? - Dupuis is leaving me. - Your assistant? He's moving to Lyon, just when I'm getting so busy! Over 6 cases in my lap. And not trifles like this one. - Why do you tell me this? - I need to replace him. A bright, ambitious young man who knows my methods. Do you know anybody? It'll be fine. I promise. Trust me? So... Here is your bus. - Bye. - Hurry, you'll miss it. Give me a smile. A real one! - Good evening. - Evening. - How are you? - Fine. - What a face. - It's the only one I have. Sorry! - Is dinner ready? - It's not 8 yet. - You know what I think? - I don't care. I'll say it anyway. You work too hard. You need a vacation. - I'm going to. - Really? Yes. I've asked to be removed from the case. Remember Pontius Pilate? He was no fool. He didn't... want to play with justice. He knew he was just a wheel in a big machine. In my place, he would have dismissed the case... and done something else. In my job, I'm expected... to work like a machine. They want me to function. - What happened? - By being honest... I'm going against Mrs. Sogeat's interests. My determination was simply pride. I thought I was Jesus... Now Jesus is thirsty and of course... there's nothing to drink! Now they're after Laura. Receiving stolen goods. It's so obvious! They found a piece that was stolen a few days ago. How convenient for them! How convenient... And as she's a foreigner... expulsion is the minimum. And that... I don't know if I can handle it. I understand, Dad. - Thanks. - For what? For understanding. Tell me... Don't you have some scotch hidden in your room? - No, but I have a suggestion. - What? - I'll take you for a drink. - OK. This is where they're building tomorrow's world? This way, Dad. It's Judge Level. - What's with them? - I don't know. Two whiskeys... no, bring the bottle. Hi Judge, how are you? I hear the sheriff's mixed up... in a robbery. I know you'll do your job. Your friends are a bit crazy. - Can I sit down? - We have to talk. So do I, but not for long. We're really glad to see you. It's an honor. We didn't believe it at first. I thought you would give in. It must be hard for you. We want you to know we're with you. - Thank you for... - It's my duty. It's nice to see an old man with guts. That'll do. I'll see you later. There's one thing your friends don't know. The bastards always win. Stop that! Let's go home. I didn't build the world. He did! The one up there! Hey, God! What do you think of it? He doesn't care, you know. He's like all the others. That's your problem... I don't want to hear about it. Isn't that nice? And look at us, with only 2 hands and a tiny brain. One man doesn't count for much. Yes, but there's two of us. I agree, but you're the big guy. What's this I see? Commissioner Bertrand's HQ. - Let's go to bed. - We must salute him first. One should be polite to superiors. Private Level, Asshole Division. My respects, General! Let's go, they'll arrest us. Good idea! Come and get me! Stop that! Come out and talk to me. What are you waiting for? Are you scared? I'm not! I'll blow up that joint. You know what to do to blow it up? Kick the cops out! Silence! If there's another outburst I'll clear the room! Continue. Then the Commissioner arrived with Inspector Bonetti... they took him to another office. The ambulance came for him at 2:00 pm. That's all I know. You said more in deposition. You said: Commissioner Bertrand... asked me to leave town. That's right. That's a lie! Why would he ask you that? He knew I would tell the truth. You mean he thought you'd accuse him of killing Sogeat? Exactly. - Your Honor! - One moment. Is that all you have to say? That's all. - Any questions? - No, your Honor. As you're so eager, Mr. Graziani, you may speak. I won't take long, your Honor. Just one question. I'd like to ask the witness if on June 16, 1967... she was arrested for theft. A theft peculiar to her profession. Known as "rolling" a client. - That is irrelevant to this case. - Allow me... We know of the witness's reputation... - so why bring this up? - It's not her reputation... but a specific event that directly concerns this case. A sailor on leave accused her of robbing him... - Do you remember this event? - No! That is... yes and no. Can you explain that? I was accused, but I didn't do it! What, another miscarriage of justice? He was drunk, he had lost his wallet. He accused me... and they gave me no chance to explain. - Who are "they"? - The Inspector. - What was your sentence? - Eight months. - How much did you do? - Six. Six months in jail? You must hate the Inspector. If you were in my place... I'm happy in mine, thank you. What was the Inspector's name? Don't you recall? Let me refresh your memory. It was Inspector Bertrand. They say vengeance is a dish best served cold, but... after three years, it's frozen! You may withdraw now. Next witness. Step forward. You are not an employee or relative of the defendant? Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing... - but the truth? - I swear. You may speak now. You were on duty at the police station on December 18. Your deposition states that Sogeat was interrogated... according to the rules and without any violence. - Is that so? - Yes, your Honor. Louder, please. Yes, your Honor. You also said none of the defendants ever... used violence on a prisoner. You also said, strangely enough... that your job forbids you to take sides in any way at all. What do you mean by that? - I didn't say that! - You signed it! I need an explanation. Maybe one of these gentlemen will get more results than me. No questions. That is all. You may withdraw. Next witness. Let's start at the beginning. You said that on the eve of his death, Sogeat came to your bar. How many customers were there? - 12, maybe 15. - Perfect. - How many drinks did they have? - I don't remember. And yet you remember how many drinks Sogeat had? You said he had one, but maybe it was two. - Well, maybe two. - Or 3 or 4... but let's continue. Let's talk about the accident. He came out, carrying boxes... ready to cross the street. What were you doing? Serving drinks as usual... Suddenly you heard a car braking. You move to the door... You couldn't see what happened without moving from the counter. Then, what do you see? Boxes on the ground... and Sogeat insulting the driver of the Mercedes. - Am I right? - Yes, you are. A man on his feet is not someone who's fallen. - Well, of course... - Or it's somebody who fell... and then got up again. Did that occur to you? I would have seen if he had fallen. You said you were serving drinks. Do you think we're fools? I'm an honest man. Until we prove the opposite. - I told what I saw. - I hope so... committing perjury will cost you dearly. Objection! He's trying to intimidate the witness. Not intimidate, warn! It's for his own good. He can still retract his statement if he's unsure. I'm sure the court would understand. So, Mr. Gassot... I don't know what to say now. You must tell the truth! You are under oath and must answer the question. What is the question? Can the witness swear that the car did not hit Sogeat? Answer. I think that... Thank you. That is all. You may withdraw. I would like to say something... about the accident. No attempt was made to find the driver or any witnesses. Judge Level lacks curiosity. I would say more... We just saw a man whom the judge questioned in the secrecy... of his office. Judge Level slanted the deposition... in order to incriminate these three policemen. So I ask: Is he merely negligent, or biased? I leave the decision to the jury. You just spoke of Judge Level. Since he is with us... I think it would be just to let him speak. If he wishes to do so. Thank you, your Honor. - No objection? - On the contrary. As you are not a witness, you need not take the oath. We are listening. Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... gentlemen... it's because I've been accused that I speak to you now. But not only for that reason. It's also, and mainly... to tell you what's been unsaid. First, during the inquiry... constant pressure was brought to bear on me. This is scandalous! Judge Level is exploiting his position... to influence the court. It's intolerable! I said I would permit no more outbursts! If there are lies in my brief, tell me who the liars are. This is your last warning! Continue. But I will not budge. And here is why... Like you, I believed that right would prevail... over wrong. I was a dreamer. Justice is a balance of lies... and the balance always leans... for whoever exerts the most pressure. I learned this lesson today from Mr. Graziani. Thank you. He accuses me of bias... of putting the police on trial. While the noble advocate puts on trial a mere magistrate. Let me assure him, I know... that the police are justice's greatest ally, but I also know... that when the police take the place of justice... civilization itself is in danger. You may say we have not reached that point yet. Luckily, in our country, the torture chamber has not... replaced the court of justice. Here, such practices and... such men are exceptions. But I must warn you... if you acquit them today... you will be condoning them. And if you do so, tomorrow... the exception will become the rule. And if, one day... they bring you your son's body... as they brought Michel Sogeat to his widow... the responsibility will be yours and yours alone. I know that in doing this... I'm digging my own grave. Maybe I'll soon be "promoted" to a county court. It doesn't matter. I love the country. - Have you finished? - Yes, your Honor. Just one word. Judge Level is certainly an honest man... a man blinded by honesty. It seems a shame to me that a judge should lower himself... to using a case to make a personal statement. It's shameful... and absurd. As for the rest, I will answer in my final speech. Court is adjourned. Return tomorrow at 1:30 pm. After today, it seems certain... that the defendants will be acquitted. Will Judge Level's speech change anything? Will his courageous statement sway the jury? Considering that the defense has offered... no good explanation for Sogeat's death. The verdict will be delivered tomorrow at 5:00 pm... after the 3 final speeches, of which Graziani's... is eagerly awaited. I think I have disposed of all charges against my clients. Neither the Public Counsel's speech, nor the forgivable... inexperience of my young colleague for the plaintiff... but allow me to continue. But I must examine one last matter... They ask, how did Sogeat die if the police did not hit him? Here is one answer. It's a case that happened three years ago... During a fight a worker is struck on the head and stunned. On waking up he goes home. The next day he returns to work. He seems in perfect health. That night, he has severe headaches. He dies of a cerebral hemorrhage. The court decided that the man who hit him 36 hours before... was entirely responsible. Now consider Sogeat... He was hit by a car after drinking... His head must have hit the ground. One thing is certain: The driver of the car never came forward. Was he afraid of questions? Sogeat died the day after the accident. Just a theory? Perhaps. But it's as good as the prosecution's. This case might have been just an ordinary accident... if a judge had not defied all decency to construct... an accusation to support his rabble-rousing convictions! Dominated by his passions... he played Don Quixote... in this fashionable attack on our police and institutions! He saw the chance to lead... a horde of subversives into battle! Let me tell you what the Sogeat case is! It's May 1968 for Judge Level! They burned my car in '68! He's proud, that judge! He seems decent and he's got class. Judge Level is not on trial here. We're judging Commissioner Bertrand... and Inspectors Rabut and Bonetti. First question... After deliberation, the answer is... No to the first question, No to the second... No to the third, No to the fourth... No to the fifth. The defendants are acquitted. Gentlemen, you are free. The law is the same for all. No privileged defendants. A life is worth nothing but nothing is worth a life. We'll avenge you, Sogeat. Nice speech. But the end was missing. Look at that. Your victory is complete. Hate has won. Oh, hate, love... you can't stop the windmills turning. Don Quixote was my favorite book when I was a kid. You should never have grown up. I've always hated lost causes. There are no lost causes. History proves it. Yesterday's losers may be tomorrow's winners. One thing counts. To take a step, even if it's a small one. Believe me, it's very important, that small step.
