Hello! Last ferry leaves day after tomorrow. Shit! Norm, you wouldn't have a home brew, boy? Oh boy, Joe... I don't know what to say to that. You know you got one. You know you got one around. I think I got a home brew there. - You think you have? - Yeah. I'll tell you, I'll give you this for a home brew. No Joe, keep your spaghetti. You think you got one though, Norm'? I'll get you a home brew, yes. You can keep your spaghetti. I don't want your spaghetti. All right, boy! That's the only one I got anyway. Yeah... You... ...go on and sit down, I'll be in in a second. Ok, my son. Oh boy, there wasn't much to that potato! Times are hard, boy. Fimes are hard and they are getting harder. - Yeah, all the time. - I hope you enjoys that. God bless you, son, god bless you. Well, boy... ...I minds the time that there were lots of home brew. Oh my God, lots of every kind of beer, now we can't get none. Oh, my son, it's hard! And is getting worse. It's getting worse all the time. I was doing a stew, yesterday, and all I had was potatoes... -...I had nothing to put in it. - And they weren't a feast for that. And they weren't very good, mostly rotten. Never thought I'd get hungry. Yeah, it's alright for you, you're only a young fella, see. You take like me... - I'm not getting younger, you see. - No boy Joe, I know what you mean. My son, I remember a lot of things around here... ...the things we used to do and all that... - The good old days, I guess. - Oh, my son... - It'll break your heart, my son. - Yes I know, Joe. It breaks your heart at my age. I tell you, it will break your heart. Yeah, it's getting really hard. I don't know what to say. There's nothing I can say, I guess. No, boy. I never thought we were coming to this. No, and I didn't either, Joe boy. Yeah, it's getting pretty bad out there. - Too bad to talk about, boy. - How are we going to survive? You can go away, I can't leave. I don't know. I don't know what to do. Poor outpon people anyways... ...what you said. But you can't take a man from the soil that he knows... ...tear up his roots and expect him to grow. And for God's sake don't say how much greener's the grass... ...'cause those uprooted people will weather too fast. He sits on his boat and his gaze on the bay... ...and he wonders from all the old things they did said. And for God's sake don't say how much greener's the grass... ...'cause those uprooted people will weather too fast. So you can't take a man from the soil that he knows... ...tear up his roots and expect him to grow. And for God's sake don't say how much greener's the grass... ...'cause those uprooted people will never... Oh! Fuck it, I got it, I forgot. I can't remember nothing, I can't remember nothing now. Shit man, it's cool out there! - Cold day, Broaders. - Yeah it is, Norm boy. So, Ron, what's Naish and your mother planning on doing, staying or going? Naish is staying. He's gonna stay with my mother. And my mother, she lived here all her life. She's going to stay here, too. Definitely, yeah. - What about you, Norm? You're going or... - I'm definitely going to stay. I am going to stay, but I got one problem. I don't want to stay and see my mother dying in the house, right'? I understand that, yeah, that's hard. So why don't you say, fuck it and we'll go to Cape! Sounds good. Sounds good. And by the way, do you have any other bottle left? Yeah, I got it saved. - Yeah? - Yep! Thundeﬂ Pach! Pach! Come on. Come here, Thunder.

Yeah, I got a fine buzz on! Good stuff. Yeah, not bad. I think I am getting the buzz on too. Fine little buzz on the go now, yeah no doubt, Norm. Pity we're getting down to the last of it. Yep. The say it's good 'til the end. So nice though, relaxing, hey boy'? Well, Broaders, we are getting there. Two little swigs, or one big swig each? Two little swigs will prolong it. We enjoyed it pretty good over all. Oh fuck it, we enjoyed it! It's good 'til the last drop. So is life. Oh, Broaders, what would I give to have one more night with her. Guns & Roses. You brought back memories. Good memories, hey, good memories, Foley? Yes, definitively. But they were the good days. Pach, Thunder! Pach! Thundeﬂ Come on Pach, come on boy! Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!
