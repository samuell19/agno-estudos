* THE HALLELUJAH TRAIL * The earth first. Thrown mountains, of the fused darkness of the earth. Mountains and valleys. The West Virgin. High plateau and red rock, of the sandstone. The immensity of the west. Prairie land, rolling to the end of the view. Oh, pioneer of the West. What fervent dreams were half-buried, in this promised land? Dreams crushed, by a cruel nature or the spear of an Indian warrior. Every page of history, should have its beginning and ours takes us to the year 1867. An army that fought, in the war between the states, who bravely fought, in many Indian campaigns, now patrolled the West, in a moment of peace, with thoughts always gifts from home. The Indians were back, the reservation, where the 1867 Peace Commission, met with several warrior tribes and secured certain promises from them. In return, the roles were handed over to the Indians, certifying them to be good citizens, who would obey the laws of the land. Many gifts were distributed. Beads pieces of cloth ... ammunition ... and war rifles, surplus. Of course, these rifles were quite unknown, to the Indians. Of course, it was understood that these weapons were to be used solely for hunting purposes. The leaves smoked early, that year. It can be a long winter it's difficult. The signs were, all over. In the high country, morning frost, sometimes it would last until the afternoon. The buffaloes were, feeding themselves voraciously. The beavers were damming and storing with a strange force. Horses and dogs were getting hairy, like never before. And this can be felt in the boom, of the bustling city mining company in Denver. Most, of historians agree, that the events that led, to the Battle of Whiskey Hills and the subsequent disaster, in Quicksand Bottoms started here in Denver, at a meeting of miners. These meetings were frequent and held as part, of the city's political fabric. But the meeting on November 4, had a marked air of gloomy foreboding. Quiet and silent, listen to me! I have an ad, to make them. That within 10 days, the city of Denver will be dry. No, oh ...! Not a drop of whiskey, anywhere. Oh ... Speak again! We can not hear you! I said that Denver, it will be dry in 10 days. Oh oh.... You heard well, what I said. I told them to leave. and I mean out! Wait a minute. I thought that Bert Keeler, was doing, a large order, but he was sick. Sam Buford was arriving then barrels, but Sam got stuck, in this bear trap. He did not tell Shelby, to get their 50 barrels, then ... So with four big orders out of reach, there is no one else. Now, get this here, saloon will be left alone. This is all there is. Look at this. And there were already gusts of snow, along the Gunner's Pass. If we can, a cold and hard winter, there will not be a wagon of whiskey, in Denver until spring. And it could be a late spring Not!... Hold this! So, what do we need? We need a plan. Hey! What does Oracle say? Good afternoon sirs. Oracle ... and about it here in winter? The buffaloes are feeding voraciously. The beavers are working "something" fierce. The horses and the dogs are growing, shaggy hair, like never before. What else? Did you see anything else? Yes, I had a vision about, uh ... Oh, come with me two days ago. Good? What you saw? Uh ... Ah thank you. It was in the food store. Come more suddenly than most. I was looking for it and there it was. What was this? Snow. Snow white and heavy. Yes, it's going to be a long and hard winter. And when a long, hard winter it hits us, by curse, it beats. Are there no supply wagons? And no whiskey. Do you know. Yes. It came two days ago. We have to have a plan. Yes... What kind of plan, Oracle? Just leave me ... Right there! Now I see! I see us all together. I... I see us putting all, the requests for whiskey, on a large shipment throughout the winter. I see us coming, an iron guarantee of, uh ... of some good company like, uh, uh ... Thank you. Like Frank Wallingham ... to take them to our bars, now even before the snows hit. I... I see, an entire train loaded wagons with whiskey coming from Julesburg. I see 20 ... 30 ... 40 wagons. Are you Hobbs? I am lord. Did you print this? I did, sir. And who, may I ask, is it you? Frank Wallingham. I understand. How are you? Are not you going to sit down, Mr. Wallingham? No. I want to know why. Why did you do that? I did not do anything else of printing the truth. 600 barrels of whiskey produced in Philadelphia move from here to Denver. Yes. So, what? happens when the Indians receive 40 wagon wind filled with brandy? They scalp us from head to toe. The Indians do not read newspapers. Who said no? The problem with the Indians, it's all settled. You have not read the report, of the Peace Committee? Okay then. It's worse than the Indians! They are agents of revenue! Oh ... You did not pay, your federal taxes, right? Of course I paid, my taxes! I am an honest businessman. And I'm a good Republican. But give these snoops, a taste of honey and they will spread from all directions, but up. You have my sympathy. Sympathy? It's because I did not announce, in his cloth, because I did not give you whiskey for free. You better get out of here. You hear me. I have every penny, that I have tied in this load. Out of spite, I'll see you arrive in Denver. You can print that, sir. I must. I'm sending a telegram, to Colonel Gearhart in Fort Russell. I'm demanding, an entire troop of US Cavalry as escort. Print this, sir! I must. Good. You should also put, in your paper, what I say, that any tax agent, white road agent, or red Indian get close to my wagons, You had better wear it. cast iron underwear. And if you try to blackmail again, I'll come back here and stick this, in your throat. Good day sir. Smythe. Yes sir. What is the name of that woman? of temperance? Martindale? Massingale, sir. Cora Templeton Massingale. Oh, yes, Massingale. Do you know where she is? On a New England tour, Last month, sir. Then Boston, to Philadelphia and to Trenton. She may be an infernal woman. about whiskey, sir. but a beautiful figure of woman with eyes ... Smythe. Sir? I asked her where she is. Oh. In Fort Russell, sir. She got there yesterday. Fort Russell? Send her a telegram. Dial with urgency. The editor of Julesburg Gazette was right. Indians did not read newspapers. It's a question of speculation, therefore, as they have heard, of the load of whiskey. There were post offices, of course, and there was the sign of smoke, used for the first time, by the ancient Greeks and Hebrews. How the Indians acquired this it does not matter here. But they did. The smoke also, was not used exclusively. A coarse mirror painted stone, the carved bark of trees, was quite popular. And a rope, with peculiar knots. The messages have always been transmitted in code. A code that no man White got to break. Regardless of which method was used by the Indians, is a matter of record, that the whiskey train news became knowledge, common within 48 hours for all Indian tribes of all the North American Plains. We still do not know why a single tribe came out, to investigate the train firefighting. But it is assumed that there was competition among the various tribes for honor. It is for us to make the recognition, position of the wagons. It is for me to do, such recognition. He is chief of the Sioux. And I am chief of the raven. We will do. You will not do it. I will do. You and I are blocked. Yes we are. Authorities agree, that disputes between the tribes of the plains resolved very quickly. Just south of Cheyenne, stood Fort Russell, famous all over the West, as a bastion of military force and the house of the injured, soldier disciplined frontier. And now, ladies, I I present one more time, Ms. Cora Templeton Massingale. Oh, thank you, thank you! His reception warmed my heart. Ladies, you have heard, that man is every mouth and muscle, that he is dirty boots in a end and a dirty mind in the other. Well you do not believe. If we are to enjoy equal rights, like man, we must respect him and if we want to respect him, then we must save him from himself and the poison of alcoholic spirits! You agree? Yes! So let the world know that. Let's spread, the word of emancipation, for all the songs, of this great nation. Emancipation! Let me hear this! Emancipation! Freedom for women! Freedom for women! Scream out loud, ladies! Women can redo, the world! Women can redo, the world! Ladies! Let me hear this! Emancipation! Scream out loud! Freedom for women! Again! Women can redo, the world! What do you think, Sergeant? I hate to say that, Colonel, but it looks like war of the Sioux or Cheyenne cry to me, sir. A revolt in the fort? Ridiculous. Yes sir. Those are buglers, sir. This is a cannon, sir! Form a line skirmish to the left! Form a line skirmish to the left! Ho! Introduce carbines! Ho! Company B returning. Open the gates. My God! She's on fire, sir! To charge! You! Good evening, Colonel. Maestro, front and center. You're stuck. This whole band is stuck. You are confined, quarters until further notice. Fired! Who are the idiots, Who fired those guns? Sergeant Perkins. Private McIntosh sir. Particular Johnson. Williams particular. Introduce yourself in my quarters tomorrow morning at nine. Yes sir. Brady Return rifles. In the archive, prepare yourself, to disassemble. Disassemble. Mrs. Article twelve, section seven, paragraph two, of the army regulations states: "Government ownership can not be, used for political demonstrations ". Sir, we have never appointed our movement, to be political. Article nine, section two, paragraph four of Army Regulations clearly states whereas civilian meetings may, be carried out in military installations when permission is granted by the commanding officer. The commanding officer? I understand. Forgive me, ma'am. We were, on patrol for six days. I'm a little tired. Captain Slater gave him permission in my absence? He did that. Brady, I want this clean mess. Yes sir. Ladies, I see that You have transportation. You will be escorted back to the city. The party will end, in exactly five minutes. Ma'am, do you have a room here? I have. Then you can withdraw, to these rooms, ma'am and remake the world, on another occasion. Good night. Buell, Lord! "HOME MUST BE SAVED FROM YOURSELF" "WHISKEY POISONS THE SOUL" Buell, bring me Captain Slater. Yes sir. Excuse me sir. Did the colonel want to see me? Where the hell did you come from? I could not leave to hear, sir. I want the colonel to know, What happened tonight? and how it happened, It was so fast I barely had time to organize my forces. You gave this woman permission, for a temperance meeting? Yes and no. That is, I had no idea, that would leave the hand, so to speak, sir. What the hell did you expect? Give an acorn to a woman and you will be on the rump in oaks. That is very true, sir. And I'm sorry. If they had not started, to move ... that is, marching. led by the band of Fort Russell. I would say, that the Mrs. Massingale led them. The band came next. You see, they were playing, the Battle, the Hymn of the Republic, and every time they arrived "Hallelujah" boom! I'm sorry, sir, about the guns. Spare me the details. Slater and what if the word comes out? that Fort Russell was behind of a temperance movement? That I, a line officer, could support this movement? Well, you're right, sir. And you let them go, in front. Well I... Actually, I was trying to prevent, the colonel's daughter, for your sake sir. What my daughter, has to do with it? Well, your daughter ... Please. I beg you not to hold Paul responsible ... Yes ... father. It was my fault. It was me who ... She was not. And I refuse to allow it, accept responsibility. I was the only one. You were not. Yes I was. Paul ... In my quarters. Sorry dad we are truly. B-but boom ... But what? But... But I can point out, Mr, that you have the only ones private quarters in the fort, and we do not wait You're back so soon. And it is true that Miss Gearhart, You have your own quarters, sir. but I thought my presence there he could put it, in a compromising position. Since my own quarters are shared, sir ... Slater! Answer me. I'm trying, sir. It is not true either. He was not keeping me outside the meeting of temperance, I was keeping him. I thought he might try to stop the march, so this looked like a lovely ... I mean, a way to divert him. Louise You really Do not you mind, dear? I mean, you certainly could not have liked it less. Louise! Oh ... Well, I would do anything, by Cora Massingale and his cause. And if you hurt her, Dad, I will never forgive you. Slater. Yes sir. The women, the rally, the cannons. I will summarize everything to your inexperience. Thank you sir. But you can not... you simply can not use my quarters to ... this kind of thing. Sorry sir. Why do not you get along? And marry the girl? Stop all that out there? Well, the colonel knows my feelings about that, sir. The West is not life, for a woman. The West is not, life for no one. Wind, dust, Indians. I hate the wind. I hate the dust. And I hate the Indians. Yes I know. And until my transfer arrives, to a post in the east, I'll ... I'm going to drink for that. For you and Louise and a transfer. There you are. I can not, sir. Why not? I did not say goodnight to Louise yet. The drink in my breath ... She knows you drink, She knows I drink. I know that, sir, but ... if you had seen her at that meeting tonight. She heard Mrs. Massingale. His eyes lit up. I scared the hell out of me, sir. All right. Go to her. Whatever it is, what you do. Thank you sir. But not on my bear rug! No, no, sir. Slater. Yes. She's an escort, for a train of wagons. Fella named Wallingham. Taxpayer, good Republican. I want you to find out how to intercept, the train and escort them, to Denver. Denver? This will take more than a week. I promised Louise ... I know I know. She's going to cry, of course. Just say your duty is a cruel master. Yes sir. To owe... is a cruel ... master. Yes sir. Thank you. Good evening, sir. Colonel Gearheart? Colonel? Colonel? I... I do not want to intrude, in your privacy, Colonel, but ... this is vitally important. I am taking a shower. The vision of a gentleman bathing is not strange to a woman, who was widowed twice. Good... Would you like to sit down? No, thank you. What I have, to say it is better to say standing. You will forgive me, if I do not get up. It is not necessary. Ms. Massingale, I already told Captain Slater, I will not blame him. In your case, I wrote down the whole incident. So now... That's not why I'm here. I received a telegram from Julesburg, which afflicts me deeply. He says that a train of 40 wagons left from there yesterday, bound for Denver. and that you must provide escort military, for that train. Is this information correct? I received an order, in that sense, yes. Did you know, Colonel, that the cargo of these 40 cars, is it alcohol? No, ma'am. Well, now you know. Tell me, colonel, Are you going to provide escort? Yes ma'am. I respectfully ask, that you reconsider, Colonel. In the name of suffering humanity, I beg you to stop the wagon and destroy this poison, that they are carrying. What you ask is ... What you ask for is impossible. The cargo is legal. I have no reason or desire destroy civilian property. And now, my lady, Are you going to leave me in my bath? Is it legal to sell whiskey to the Indians? Who said anything ... Who said anything about Indians? The cargo goes to Denver, for businessmen there. How do you know? I have the owner's word for it. Mr. Frank Wallingham, who is known a taxpayer and a good Republican. Well, in that case, You force me to act. Our movement has many friends in many high places. Men like ... Horace Greeley. Is this a threat? You can consider this if you want. My conscience forces me to do this. And mine demands, that I do my duty. So be it. I can impose your kindness the instructions, to the telegraph post? Mrs Massingale, I'll do better than that. I'll provide you with transportation, to the office, from the Cheyenne Telegraph, where your messages certainly they will leave twice as fast. Thanks. Call me again if there is any Anything else I can do. You are a very man generous, colonel. All right! Ho! Lord, three telegrams they just arrived. Read them. "The governor of Colorado, is against alcohol and its vicissitudes, but its position makes it impossible to take a position in terms of cargo whiskey to Denver. "Ah! "The Office of the Assistant General is grateful to Female Temperance by the splendid moral factor, they have on the American soldier. Yet" Subjects of whiskey should be left, for the commanders in the field. "Respectfully". Ah ... "Mr. Horace Greeley already defended the noble cause, of temperance and of suffrage, but is unable to interfere, with the constituted authority, of the West. "Ah ... Buell ... Sir! Give these to the Massingale with my compliments and arrange transportation for it. Your movement is moving. Yes sir. On the morning of November 16, the Wallingham freight wagon, moved north of the South Platte River. In the head was its owner, Frank Wallingham and his wagon master, Rafe Pike. In the back was a group of Irish truck drivers, under the leadership of a Kevin O'Flaherty. Slater's patrol, was turning to the south, for the train travel of Wallingham, and a bunch of warriors Sioux was on the move, led by the great boss 5 Barrels and his sub-boss, Walks-Stooped-Over, who was also known, in certain Indian circles, like eyes of heaven, due to the blue color of the eyes, the inheritance apparently of some slight, uh ... irregularity, in their ancestry. Please, father, be reasonable. Do not. If the Massingale wishes a farewell meeting, can use the cafeteria. But I will not participate. But we are not asking, that you make the commitment. Although a little temperance, can make you happier. No man who drinks blood red, is more temperate than I am. And I'm happy. I'm very happy. If you just tried understand, Mrs Massingale, a woman who lost, two husbands for alcohol. They drank, until one premature burial. I can only imagine, why. You absolutely refuse, father, to attend this meeting? I do and start to I regret giving you the salon. The least you can do, is to release the posot band. Do not. But we can not sing hymns without them. Good. It makes no sense to have the meeting. Splendid. Please, Dad. That means a lot to us. And Mrs. Massingale is leaving. We may never see her again. Can I depend on it? I never come back to my word. I'll say goodbye at the meeting. Well, maybe the trombones. Oh, thank you, father. You are a sweetheart. And the drums? No. Not drums. Good afternoon. What is going on there? Singing, sir. Do you have guards at all exits? As you asked, sir. You'd better bend the guards. Check the exits yourself. If they leave that corridor in formation of march ... This is what happened, with Captain Slater. Yes sir. Ladies, our enemy has two heads. First, enslavement, of women by men. Yes. And second, enslavement, of men themselves by ruthless tyrant alcohol. We are willing to fight against these enemies? Yes... Then we should seek, the Liberty, and pluck this tyrant, from the lips of men. Now, ladies, I have an ad to make, for each and every one of you, that touched my heart. It's time to say goodbye of all the wonderful women ... Thank God! Something has happened and requires my presence elsewhere. I'm going to the city of Denver. Denver? I know I know. You ask me "Why Denver?" I'll tell you why. Because 40 Whiskey Wagons are going to Denver now. 40 poison wagons for these poor disoriented citizens, and no one in high office seems to care. Well, I do! And I'll scream over and over again, up the mountains of Colorado crumble in the halls of Denver. Will your hearts go with me? Yes! Is our cause just and just? Yes! I doubled the guards, sir. I want you to save, the main entrance, right. Do I have your blessings? Yes! Not! Not! I can not let you go to That sinful city alone. If you want me, Mrs. Massingale, I'm going with you. Go there. Drag my daughter, off that platform. Oh, how wonderful, ladies! Ladies, let's all, to Denver. Yes! We are going to do, our music, marching. Yes! Well, Buell? Just ... trying to recover my breath, sir. You hit me, sir. You heard what ... The woman said, sir? I made. But sir ... "But, sir," what? How can we let them to get through it, sir? From March to Denver across the country, so no escort or protection? And if they find, A lot of Indians, sir? I suggest we pray for the Indians. The army may refuse, the escort, sir? From now on, the army will do what I say to do. Ah, what do you intend? to do, sir? Good morning, Miss Gearhart. Good morning, Sergeant Buell. Go away. Louise, please, Are you leaving? That should make you feel better. Good hot milk. Oh! What's going on out there? You will stop this bustle of hell? "THADEUS P. GEARHART, CAV. COMMAND" You will not, under any circumstances, go out with that ... that woman. Yes father. To Denver or to any other place. I want this clearly understood. Yes father. Oh ... Now you go, please. leave me alone He's better? I'm afraid not. Louise, get some more blankets A lot of them. I want him to cross. Let's sweat the venom of your system. Blankets. All right, Mrs. Massingale. Mrs. Massingale! Lay down. Mrs... Back. Now just stay Quiet, please. Do not push yourself. Ma'am, we have a surgeon. Just chill. Let the blood flow. Now tell me, Colonel, Is the pain center around here? Look, Mrs. Good! It's a bit higher. A little higher. Yes of course. On this march, Mrs. Massingale ... Just chill. This march to Denver ... impossible. Right here, at this intersection, Colonel, a string of strings. And beneath them, intertwined nerves, like fine silk threads. Transportation issues. Rattlesnakes ... Everything connected here, where the center of pain lies. Examine my position. Consider, if you want ... That's nice. This is the key point. First: we rub gently down, and then up and then ... Oh ... down again. Now you are starting to relax. I can feel it in my fingers. I wish I could help you, but ... Army Regulations. Article 12, section 26, Paragraph"... Is this right. Ah ... to relax. Ah ... relax. Company, attention! Company, attention! Good morning, Colonel Gearhart. Good morning Dad. Good morning, ladies.

Yes, they want the Colonel Do something about it, sir. Sir. Good? The colonel intends ... I mean, sir, Go to the party of the companion ... Lord, you really Do you want to go through this? Buell, you have much to learn. about military science. Right. A simple question of objective and stratagem. Aim to get rid of those, damn women. Stratagem ... Take them to Denver, sir? Monte, Buell. Mount. Yes sir. Move them out, Brady. Yes sir. Two left! All right! Ho! All right! Ho! Present arms! All right! Ho! Everything left! Ho! It's all right! Ho. We are going the right way. Now, oh. You! Ho. Let's sing! Buell! Sir! A bugler, only a bugler, joins with this song, I'll have him shoot! Yes sir. It may be wise at this point, position in this historic arena. Julesburg is here. To the southwest along the south Platte River is the city of Denver. To the north we find Fort Russell. The Wallingham freight wagon, had changed to that point in the river. The first patrol of cavalry, under Captain Slater, here. The second cavalry under command, of Colonel Gearhan, here with, of course, the protesters, of temperance. And the Sioux band here. In the city of Denver, another meeting of miners was being held. Come on! Let's go... Hold it! Hold it. This meeting, is called to order. Tell me who called you to this meeting, for what it is and what it's all about! I made. Clayton we have, to face the facts. There was no word of that wagon in two weeks. Is this right. There's already snow on the Grizzly Pass. Good afternoon sirs. Oracle, the problem is that we ... We have problems. Do you know? This wagon can not, never reach you. Why not? Thank you. Everything was ready, to come to me. I was looking and uh ... uh ... Thank you. Over there! Now I see! What? Indians. I see hundreds of Indians, Indians ... You see something else, Oracle? I think... I see men ... I see men on the march. Cavalry? Of course not. This is no time for children. I see men, men carrying, uh ... choose and, uh ... axes and uh ... uh ... uh ... shovels. Who are they? Denver Citizens Militia. In check out there for intercept that train wagon and see that the whiskey, arrive at home. Wait, Oracle. We are working with men. We are miners. We are not fighters. I will not go up rivers, sleeping on the rocks and cooking on campfires. You will spend the whole winter, in Denver without any whiskey? At dawn in the morning, of the day 17 of November, the second cavalry patrol was going south to Denver, with merchants, of temperance. The Wallingham freight wagons, were returning, to the west. The first cavalry patrol was moving quickly, to intercept it. The Denver Citizen Militia was making an east crossing the South Platte River, while the Sioux Indians were descending from the north, taking the bravest, all the time. Wow, oh! For the beloved love of all the Saints, St Pat and Mike and Bridget, and all souls of purgatory, not again! Call yourself a wagon! You rotted wood collection! You are not fit, to lead the vultures! Oh, wow! All right, O'Flaherty. What is your excuse this time, your ignorant immigrant? Oh, lump, is this it? Good... All things being equal, we'll have a word, with your landlord. I told you, I'm not a landlord! Can not wait, an Irish servant to forget, the habits of a whole life now. Just move on. Well now. We, the Irish Teamsters, has a petition for grievances. We affirm in simple and simple the poor conditions under which we were forced to work, and hereby raise an objection following: hours of travel and exploitation, unrest, caring for horses, Loading, Loading, Carrying, guard duty, poor drinking water, order of wagons in March and I should add, in addition to without whiskey ration, on a whole load of whiskey. Now suppose that these complaints, are not answered? What will you do? Strike? Oh, that's an ugly word, for a hardworking man, sir But that would be considered. Ah ... Well, in that case, O'Flaherty, you attack. Strike. And who, pray, pray with me, Are you going to drive? your sweat, rotten cars? There are your complaints. We discarded another 12 copies. Explorer! Capitalist! Explorer! Capitalist! Mr. Wallingham, I presume. Captain Slater at your service. Colonel Gearhart, send your regards. He is very happy to comply, your request for escort to Denver. Good for Colonel Gearheart. Have you seen any Indians? A scout told me ... There are no Indians here. Not you Have you heard of the Peace Committee? With such a load, you have to be sure, of course! Indians, revenue agents, women of temperance. Ah you know. Know what? About Cora Massingale. At where? Everything is alright. She is not here. She is in Fort Russell, giving lectures on temperance. Are you sure that she is in Fort Russell? I positively assure you that. She's not closer. of its load than ... than the Indians. I hope it's hot. Wait until we come in. Sergeant, I ... We have a problem of morality, sir. Take care of it, Buell. I think the colonel will have to eradicate, sir, right in the center. The ladies, sir, are taking baths ... naked Ms. Massingale, I would like to talk with you. Would you mind calling Another time, Colonel? I am taking a shower. I'm well aware that you is taking a shower. I dont care, how dirty you are. I will not leave you bathing naked. There is no other way, that I know, Colonel. The opportunity was there and ... who knows what tomorrow might bring? Especially now, that we changed our plans. Changed your plans? Yes, Colonel. It means that you want to go back, to Cheyenne now? Do not be ridiculous. Of course not. We just want to know, the wagons. But you're finding, the train. That's why we are going to Denver. But we want to find it, long before arriving in Denver. That's not possible. On the contrary. Now we intend to intercept, the wagons along the Platte River. You what? In a clash of wills, colonel The one who screams the loudest it's lost. Mrs... If I understand, you will lead their wives, across the country, of unstable plains. Along the trail, the South Platte River. Exactly. And knowing the wagons, I assume you will make a demonstration, whose goal is to lower the train. Precisely. Very well. But if you think United States Army will escort a bunch of females without brains through the open desert, committed to playing under teams of horses, you are seriously mistaken. Very well. I thank you for your many courtesies so far, but if you force us to follow, our unescorted journey and any damage occurs to us, Three million women enraged will turn, the Department of War upside down. Mrs Massingale, if I could force her to do Anything, what? obviously I can not would go home and stay at home where all, decent women belong. Sergeant. Sir? Damn it. Yes sir. Sergeant, I want some scouts on the trail of these women tomorrow. Ask them to keep constant contact with us. Let's move in one direction somewhat parallel. Yes sir. Excuse me sir. Parallel direction ... Is that a new tactic, sir? I'm not familiar with that. It was well known during the war. Yes, sir, of course. What's your name, sir? Called? What commandment should I give to men? "Move in a parallel direction"? Is called... separate contact. Contact unlinked? And so be recorded, in the diary! Yes sir. No document may establish, with the Sioux formulated their plans, although it is known that a been formulated. All we can do, is to suppose what was said. We will attack the white man! White man wins, war. Now we use the path, of the white man. You, Walks-Stooped-Over, with 20 braves attack, the front of the train of wagons, and remove your guard. You, Chief Elks-Runner, with 20 braves attack on the rear of the train of wagons and pull by surprise. All the other bravos attack, the center of the train of wagons. When Long Knives chasing braves, so great boss 5 barrels and two brothers-in-law circle around the train of whole wagon, comes from the southeast, take the last three wagons and go to hell ... to the west. In the morning, when the sun rises over, the iron mountain, two hands high, attack! I Long! If Long Knives Capture Braves, show them paper. We are good Indians. No problems. Go back to the reservation. But before you go do not forget to ask for gifts. Right, right, right ... In preparation for their attack, the Indians occupied three positions. On here... Here ... and here. Wallingham freight cars was moving in that direction, escorted by the first patrol of cavalry. The marchands of temperance, having turned to the east, were moving in that direction. The second patrol of cavalry under Colonel Gearhart was maintaining detachable contact. The citizens' militia was now going, north in that position. Obviously, a collision course for all involved. The day started with a storm of disturbing proportions. Rafe. Rafe! Rafe! What? Take them there! There is? Let's get them wagons up! Keep an eye on them Irishmen! What? Watch out for the shakers! There is? Shut up! To arise Break it up now. They will think we are lost in the storm. They will have to yield, to our demands. Keep together, everyone and keep walking! Do not freak out. We'll pass. Buell, get a beater. Make contact with women. They may need help. Sir, Phillips! Oracle, you can see anything? Anything. I mean, in your mind. I need whiskey. Rafe! Rafe! Pretend that we are lost! We're lost! Oracle, are you sure? Do you know where you're going? I mean, are not you lost? Of course I'm not lost. Now you want to stay behind of me and keep the gain. Follow me men. Now listen to me, your men. We will protect ourselves of this dust and ... We're getting lost! Come on, come on! To attack! Hey! Hey, wait ... Ladies, form a circle! Rafe! Rafe! Rafe! Rafe! Rafe! Rafe! Was that a shoot-out? There is? Did I say you heard shots? What? Form a circle, dammit! Form a circle! A circle! Form a circle! Form a circle! Militia! Form a circle! Wow!! Take cover, ladies! Keep turning it on! Henry!

They are Indians, sir! What? Indians, sir! And they have the women! Good God! To charge! A lot of effort was made to join to the chronological events of this action, but due to poor visibility, we can only approach positions. When the battle, was approaching the climax, we believe the train of wagons was here. The two elements of the first detachment of cavalry here and here. The second posting of cavalry here. Demonstrators of temperance, of women here. The Denver Citizen Militia approximately here. The Indians, here, here and ... Ah! On here. No one knows what happened with the Irish on strike. To the best of our knowledge, these are the final positions in the engagement that became known in the history as the Battle of Whiskey Hills, but that, of course, was nothing compared to the subsequent disaster button at the bottom of Quicksand. It's a miracle. I beg your pardon, sir? A miracle of the highest order, that so many bullets could lose so many people in such a small area, in such a short space of time. No fatality at all? None reported, sir. What do you propose we do now? Our duty is crystal clear. The first thing we should doing is keeping the peace. Do you agree, Buell? Absolutely, sir. There are three important steps for peace negotiations. No fraternization and no discharge of firearms. Yes sir. And the third step, sir? The third step? It's not important. The important, is to have a conference. No peace is made, without a conference, Slater. Buell, report to all the parties concerned, a conference will be held here in an hour. Yes sir. In addition, my contract I got it here, says I'll deliver, and I'll deliver come hell or high water. You have to take the damn things out. foreigners from here. Mr. Wallingham ...

They picked up 10 wagons and formed a circle. Where is Warlingham? He's joining the militia, sir. I put a platoon between them and the ladies. The ladies? They are supporting the strike, sir. It is quite possible, violence is imminent. Get down from there, you alien radical! Capitalist! Anarchist! Hold your positions, ladies. You finally got here, as you did? I want you to get it this fucking mess, now. You! Just what you and your ladies Are you doing so far? Only by exercising our right of peaceful assembly, as guaranteed by the Constitution, that you an army officer, swore to defend. O'Flaherty. We are just honest your landlord's workers exercising our right given, by God's refusal to work. There is! You are, a bunch of cowards hiding behind, of these women's skirts. Besides, you're a bunch. of Irish thieves. They stole 10, of my wagons. I demand that you do something about it. Now calm down, Mr. Warlingham. I can see your wagons. They do not look stolen to me. Well, they're so good when stolen, damn it! I must remind you, sir, there are ladies present. Damn, they're there. I want them to be removed. Sorry sir Mr Wallingham, but this is obviously, a labor dispute. As much as I hate to admit, Ms. Massingale and Mr. O'Flaherty, are within your rights. And as for my rights as taxpayer and good republican? I will protect, their wagons and cargo, but under the regulations, I can not ... All right, men. Enough of this conversation of a soldier's lawyer. Club under the Irish. Bet them and take women out. Slater, take care. You will find strength in measure, where necessary. Companies, A and B, rise! Ho! Present arms! Ho! Ah ... Get in there! What are you waiting for? Uh ... be reasonable, Frank. We can not fight against, the United States Army. It would not look good. Ah ... All right, Gearhart.

Congratulations, Mrs. Massingale. A brilliant maneuver, executed without fail. Thank you Colonel. I'm very flattered. Keep order, Slater. Ladies. Mrs. Massingale, lady ... Would you mind telling me, What do you hope to gain from all this? Time, on the one hand. Oh, but you can not keep my wagons fixed forever. We'll see. Would you mind telling me, What would be your next step? Well, besides our picket line not violent, we have no plans. Except having our meeting, in the Indian camp tonight. What? A rally. A rally, Frank. Hold your positions, ladies. Come on, Louise. A rally in the Indian camp. What did he say? He says, uh ... "It's good to sign the paper on white, Indian woman. Good for Peace ". If it is the last thing that I do, I will have the whole band transferred to Alaska. What are you doing now? Singing, sir. And signing promises. I do not believe that. As far as I can tell, they already have 50 signed. Get back there, sergeant. Get me one of those promises. I want to see it. How can I get one, Mr? Yes sir! You can handle, With the rest of it, Louise? You can count on me, Mrs. Massingale. I'm going to distribute for Group B. Good luck, Cora. Here, sir. Just a crazy brand, but each one is different. That woman! How many? Now, sir. 81? Come back, Buell. Yes sir. And tell Slater, to cover its flanks. Yes sir. Chisel. Axe. Hammer. Where is this woman? of Massingale? She is down there somewhere, Frank, taking advantage of ignorant savages. There must be a law against it. There must be something. I do not trust her. Just hold, his pants on, Frank. Boss says ... "There is no more peace." What is it, sergeant? What happened, sergeant? The Indians captured, the women. What? One minute they were signing commitments and then ... Like that Slater idiot let that happen On behalf of Captain Slater, Sir, it's fair to say that if women did not have started singing hymns and doing all that ... racket... Lord, the Indians disarmed my men and took the ladies captive. I know what they did, Slater. Yes. They moved. quickly we were at a disadvantage, there was no Nothing I could do. Sergeant. Sir! Alert the bugler. Light the camp. Get ready for battle. Yes sir! Lord, any precipitate movement, on our part can put, the life of women. Damn I can not just turn my thumbs. No sir! Sir, the sergeant That's right, sir. An attack can now be, the most reckless ... sir. Why is he here? He is a symbol of their good faith. Good faith? They want to negotiate with us. Bargain? 20 wagons of whiskey, in exchange for women. 20 wagons? Yes sir. You see, the Indians ... Can he understand us? Not a word, sir. 20 wagons arrive at about ... three and seven eighths women by wagon. I think that was it, or maybe the interpreter was confused. Slater. Yes sir. There is only one course of action now. I'm Declaring Martial Law! I say that you, You can not do this! No colonel has to come here and declare martial law. If you do not shut up, Mr. Wallingham, my first step will be to lock it. Sirs, this fight can lead to nothing constructive. Since you can not take, a military action against the Indians and you can not negotiate with them, there is only one course of action open to us. We have to agree to your requirements. and give them the whiskey without delay. Give whiskey to the Indians, is strictly prohibited by the regulations of the army, are dear to you, Mrs. Massingale. Not if the Indians, Do not drink the whiskey. What prevents the Indians to drink whiskey? Precisely. I have your promises. One hundred signed promises with this on top signed, by Boss 5 Barrels, himself. That's your brand. She is right. That's your brand. Well they get the whiskey? It's my whiskey and you. will not touch a drop of it! Listen to Frank ... Quiet! In that case, I have no choice but to Destroy all the whiskey, right now. You're bluffing. Ah ... I am? There is a woman hidden, in each and every one of these wagons, waiting for my request for the code, to start breaking, the barrels of this vile burden. Lady, you lie. In fact? Ladies of Group B ... Frank, you will keep, your pants tucked in? The sign was to be a hymn, but this is not necessary. I'll just tell them, to begin. You would not do that. Ladies, Group B, you can get started! Drill the barrels! Do not wait! Just a moment, ladies! You let her break, a barrel and I'll have those brass buttons torn from his breast! I'm a contributor and a good Republican! You say it one more time. and I'm going to munch You're right on the nose! Are you threatening me? Now sit down! Did you hear that? Sit down! Come on, Frank. Sit down. And shut up! Mrs. Massingale, sit down. Sit down! And just sit there. Ladies of Group B. Get out of those wagons! Right now! Sergeant, put this on. Yes sir. The United States Army confiscates 20 Wallingham train wagons. Over there! Do you hear that? Confiscation of private property, In that case, I will be fully refunded. Go ahead, declare martial law. Martial law to enter in effect at dawn. You declare it right now! Do not tell me when, I will declare martial law. Slater. Yes sir. Take this symbol in good faith back to Chief 5 Barrels. And Slater, drop the price. Buell, Lord! This meeting is closed. Get out of here! Continues! Get out of here, You bunch of vandals! Get out of my property! Get out of my bed! Get out of here! Ah ... Get out of that wagon! Get out of here! Out! Out! I thought I heard you, Frank. Hehehe... You put me through this, You guessed it. And now I'm going to get you out of it, Frank. In fact, everything is ready. Everything is ready except one more task I need to do now. Believe me, Frank you just rely on the old Oracle. Me and my girl Billy, We'll fix everything. Come on now, Billy girl. Take me slowly and bring me the truth. Colonel? Go away! Lady, I do not know, what are you doing but whatever it is, I do not want to hear about it. I came to tell you how really I'm sorry, I'm what I did. Thank you and good night. Colonel, you realize, what will happen? when the word comes out that you, gave 20 wagons of whiskey, for Sioux Indians? I see! 20 wagons confiscated from a taxpayer and a good Republican. You do not tell me what he is, or I'll blow you in the nose! Colonel, these ropes again. Just leave me ... Get away from my cords! If you just relax and let the blood flow ... My blood can flow, on its own. Mrs Massingale, I do not know What are your plans for tomorrow, but judging from experience, You better get some rest. How can I rest later, What did I do with you? To experiment! Ah ... My selfishness, my obstinacy, my stupidity in not listening, his advice. I have to agree with you. It's all my fault, you are in that position. Well, crying will not help. Mrs. Massingale ... Mrs. Massingale! You do not need, look so shocked. Plato, Augustus, Alexander ... even George Washington, took occasional spirits, in medicinal amounts. There is nothing wrong with libation limited under emotional stress. You and your career, whole is ruined! I well ... I suppose, that there will be some criticism. Criticism? You will be crucified! The press, the public, the Department of War. Horace Greeley. Ah ... Well, if I can save, the life of 27 women, I ... I would be happy to sacrifice my career. After all, what is it? Only 19 years of service. With Grant in Vicksburg. With Thomas in Nashville. 17 Indian campaigns, Laramie to Fort Hall. One more year. $ 281 and 25 cents, per month of pension. Sergeant Buell, $ 27 and 50 cents a month. Every month. 19 years old. And all this time, never once i I've never met anyone like ... Like me? Oh, well, I'll just go. resign gracefully. Anyway, I will resign. Well, at least you still you will have your beloved West. I hate the west. Oh gosh! Dust, wind, Indians. My stubbornness, my obstinacy, my selfishness. Now, now, Cora ... uh ... Mrs. Massingale. If I had listened to you. If only! Relax, relax, Mrs. Massingale ... Cora. Do you think you could Forgive me, Thaddeus? Well I... I could try. Cora ... We could not forget all this? I mean... I mean... just forget the whole thing ... Cora? Colonel Gearhart! One moment, Slater. Come in, Slater. Captain Slater reporting, sir. On foot, we will march, to Denver. Come on! What do you mean? Chief 5 Barrels said, that it would take 15 barrels. I came back with eight and he said 13. I think, that was the number. The language barrier, It's very difficult, sir. Did you come to any agreement? 10 wagons of whiskey. 10 wagons? For all women. Good work, Slater. Thank you sir. What is he doing here? Same, sir. A symbol of good faith. Are you sure that he can not understand us? Any word. That's all, Slater. Wait. Oh ... the Indians would like to have ... uh ... Mrs Massingale is present, for the exchange, sir. Whereby? Our symbol of good faith. Tell Chief 5 Barrels. I would be happy to join to my brave ladies. Yes ma'am. I will do all, the arrangements for the exchange, sir. Good night, Slater. It's marked, for dawn. Ah ... Thaddeus, is not it wonderful? 10 wagons. This is the exact number of possession, of Irish truckers. You will not have to confiscate any of Mr. Wallingham's carts, after all. Yes well... It's a long day tomorrow, But you need to rest. I'll take you back to your camp. Oh oh... I can go back by myself. Of course! You're right? Thaddeus ... You are so kind and generous ... and courageous. Good night, Thaddeus. There is? Frank, she's all repaired. What? Frank, listen carefully. This is important. Frank! Hey, Frank! You've been drinking. Frank, listen carefully. If you could take it, your wagon from here, if you could cross the river like no one, no Indians, no women, or army could follow, Would you do it? As? Wait a minute! You would have to give them 10 wagons in the bag. Now, here's what we do. We took the rest of the wagons and we rode through Quicksand Bottoms. None of them could see us. Hold this. We would cross the river ... Hold on! Only Damn minute now. No one can cross the of quicksand because they sink. We can. There's a way, Frank. I found this five years ago. A bunch of Indians hungry for leather hairy haunted me to the edge. I knew for sure, that they would get me that night, if I did not to cross. I just pointed out my girl Billy to the south and I let her go. She did not miss a step. I did the same thing tonight. She led me forward. I traced a trail from the back, with my red flannel. We can not miss it. We'll get all the wagons, that you have and we will cross, we'll be pulling the stakes as we shall. They will not even know, What happened to us. Once on the other side of Bottoms, is a straight shot to Denver about a flat and open country. We will be free and clear. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Sh! Blow up! Yes ... My feelings exactly. Hallelujah. Here is one. Here's another one. On here... and here is one. But what are they? I do not know. But does it look familiar? It looks like Mr. Jones's underwear. This is. Are ... are you sure? The ladies confirmed that. He is not using these underdrawers now. They are torn into pieces and scattered on stakes all over the place, Quicksand Bottoms. Where is Group C? Mrs Massingale, you have any idea, what are these bets? I'm not sure, but I know, What are we going to do with them? What? Move them. Stay between the red markers. Do not be late. Keep your wagons, very close to all of you! Militia, when we moved, get in the wagons. That's the sign, sir. All the wagons ready, for exchange. Platoons A and B in position. Get down there, Buell. Send Mrs. Massingale, to the point of exchange. Can be! Mrs. Massingale! Oh oh! Mrs. Massingale, excuse me. I'm busy now, Mr. O'Flaherty. It's about 10 wagons. What's the matter with them? Nothing, Mother, but it's not whiskey. Is not that whiskey? No, mother. These carts are filled with French champagne. All of them. Do you know anything about French champagne, mumm? Well, I took mine once second honeymoon in Paris. Yes, but it was probably cold. These bottles are not, they are hot. If you open a bottle of hot champagne, especially when it is forced, well that's... You mean, Do they explode? As a Marsh weapon, about .58 caliber. We have to deal with these bottles like dynamite. That's why they hired us Irish truckers. It's our business. What will happen when, the savages get them wagons? What will happen, with that champagne? Explosions. Right. I just thought, that someone should know. Have you told Colonel Gearhart yet? Oh, no, Mother. I am afraid of. What is holding you, Mrs. Massingale? Sorry, Sergeant Buell. Excuse me, Mr. O'Flaherty. Mrs. Massingale, we have a small problem. Chief 5 Barrels insists, in taking the first wagon, his two brothers-in-law, the second and third wagons ... Elks-Runner the fourth wagon. This leaves no one, in command of your side. I do not command You? Do you speak our language? I speak bema your tongue. I am fine. Drink later. It's ok! We'll agree, with its assuming a condition, I who stay on the point exchange all the time. Me ... all the time. Good. One moment, please, captain. Mrs. Massingale, I will never forgive myself, for having failed you. 10 wagons of whiskey, for the Indians. I destroyed the crusade. Not yet. What? Give me a hat. The pine? Our goal is still in sight, Louise. Courage, ladies! First three ladies, front and center. There they go, sir. Three women starting from the other side ... Sir ... Sir! What is the problem? That Massingale woman. She's going, to the point of exchange. Why is this symbol of good faith there? I can not say, sir. Roll the first wagon. First wagon ... roll! What he is trying to do, fleeing from there like this? Two roller wagon. Wagon two ... roll! Ladies, get out! Wagon two, roll! Next three ladies, front and center. Tell them not to run away like that. Our teams will be out of control. Tell these Indians, so they do not run away like that. Three roller wagon. Wagon three, roll! Roll!

You'll never get them back! Fill them! Fill them up! Hey you! Fill them! You're going the wrong way! All Wallingham train! Hey! Hey you! Tum them, them! Come back to the shifting sands. Uh ... company, stop. Wow!! Wow!! Bring them there! Follow them red flags! All right! Follow them flags red as you go. Stay well with them. Follow them small red flags there. Follow them bookmarks!

Get them out of here! All right, take them off! Get them out of here. Go ahead, take them off! Tell the colonel that the Indians are shooting at us! Give the fire back! Do not shoot! Do not shoot! Do not shoot! I beg you pardon! What do you think, What are you doing to me? My God! They have, Mrs. Massingale! Sir! Lord, they're shaking, a flag of truce! It's a woman's petticoat. To charge! Thaddeus! You! We're going home now. Do you speak my language? I speak your language well. We go home, hunt buffaloes. Pacific Indian. Forget about gifts. You hunt buffaloes in peace. You hunted deer of green forest in peace. You go home in peace. But go home! Ah ... Hey. He!!! Hey! Hey! Get them out of here. Rafe! Rafe! Throw me that rope! Yes. Take a rope! Hold on to what you have, Frank. I'm coming. I'm going to help you. Hold on to what you have, Frank! I'll be right there with you. Make it fast for that tree. Take the slack off this line. Tighten. Now, hold this. Hold it! Hold it! Companies A and B, of the cavalry escorted demonstrators of ex-temperance back to their husbands and hungry children in Fort Russell. It is to be assumed some time ago before the Indians could regain his usual composure. But it is known that the exploits of his journey became tribal legends, be counted again and again from generation to generation, with slight revisions. The Denver Free Militia dissolved, never to march again. And of course, the Irish truckers failed and Wallingham Freighting Company went bankrupt, not having visible assets. Yes you know, Frank some Indians They told me once ... Reliable Injuns, Frank. They said that a Cheyenne courageous and his pony sank here, and durned if they do not drain again as natural as appearance And as beautiful as you want. Oh, they were dead, of course, but very close to the top, where you could catch easy. It may be worth the wait, Hey, Frank? Frank? Over there. You see? Then the great disaster on Quicksand Bottoms. Oh yes. Mrs. Massingale. Cora Templeton Massingale retired, of participation, in temperance movements. A military wedding, was held at Fort Russell. As a smoked out, It was a double wedding. A claim of homestead was presented by Mr. Jones and Mr. Wallingham on a piece of land that encompasses the entire Quicksand Bottoms area. Frank? Frank Hey. Frank! What? Frank! Let's go. Wow, Frank. Frank, watch out, watch out, watch out. Oracle ... Oracle. Oracle. Oracle! Oracle. Oracle. Over there! Now I see! Glory, hallelujah! Hallelujah! Not to be denied that there were re-emer- occasional whiskey barrels, who kept Mr. Jones and Mr. Wallingham, uh ... uh ... enough content, for several years. And despite all the predictions, shaggy hair and beavers occupied to the contrary, the winter of 1867 ended being the driest and hot of all time. This was the year, oh, pioneer of the West, and the days of the Hallelujah Trail.
