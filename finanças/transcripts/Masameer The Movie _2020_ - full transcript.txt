This is not a photographic camera. Good afternoon. Hello. What exactly are you doing there? We have orders to arrange for the demolition of your cafeteria. Excuse me? My friend, the government is foreclosing this property immediately. They say there have been complaints by the neighbors that you're causing a drop in real-estate prices, you're causing pollution, you're a general nuisance, I don't know. - But nobody has told us. - It's okay, the owner knows. What are you going to build here after the demolition? Well, looks like it will be a "public service" establishment. Something the entire neighborhood can use. What, like a research center? Okay, look closely. This area... - Our lounge! - That will be turned into regular toilets. - And over here... - That's where our TV is! They will build squat-toilet rooms. And at that spot over there... - Our kitchen. - Those will be disabled toilets. Bro, what kind of research center needs all these toilet rooms? It's not a research center, genius! It's a public restroom! - No offense to you and your friends. - None taken. Okay, what about these three dots by the garbage bins? That's you and your friends! Tough luck! Look what I have to deal with in this searing heat! Where do they find these type of people? Anyway, get your things together. The big birdie will be coming over at any moment. - Who? - You know what? I'll just play you what it sounds like. It's very rhythmic, isn't it? Ow! Ow, Saad! I see you're giving up. Abu Ghannam, there's no shame in quitting. I can smell the meat on your bones. - How long did I hang on? - Three hours and 20 minutes. Only real men can take on serious battles. I quit! Such an embarrassing failure, Abu Ghannam. This is such a stupid game! Don't hate the game, Saad, hate the player. Saltouh, turns out your friend is... Know your role, amateur. They're turning our cafeteria into public toilets. Huh? Someone from Housing and Urban Development just told me - they're tearing the place down. - You're kidding me. I'm not kidding! We have to pack all our stuff tonight! Over my dead body! We're not going anywhere! We don't have a choice! It's a court order. Toilets? This is what our lives have come to? Don't listen to that defeatist! It's settled, man! He showed me the blueprints and everything! This can't be, guys. I love this place. I don't have anywhere else to go. Okay. I know what'll lift you up. Who wants to play the Ring of Fire Challenge? Hey, Mohammed! Hey, S'aidan! Stop! What are you doing! You just couldn't wait to tear it down, could you? We barely had any time to pack our stuff! Answer him, the man is talking to you. Not my problem. What the...? I'll show you. Hey, look at me. Hey! Get your paws off my person, please. We're praying soon and I don't want to wash up all over again. What did you just say? Easy, man. The gentleman is a government employee. Guys, aren't you all sick of being worthless insects? I'm an MIT graduate. But I haven't done anything with my life until now. My mom keeps calling and asking if I've got a job, found a wife, and says she wants to see her grandchildren. What's this? What is that? Looks good. Hey! What are you doing? I'm looking for a watch. You're looking for a watch in the trash bin? A Rolex GMT-Master. In a dumpster? I know, man. But did you notice the kind of neighborhood we're in? This is the kind of neighborhood where the saying goes... "One man's trash..." "...is another man's treasure." What do you mean? One man's trash is another man's treasure. Wait, what do we have here? What's this? There's something there! It's probably full of baby diapers. Turns out it's not a PlayStation 4. What did I tell you? It's a PlayStation 5! That's not even out yet! I don't know if you fully understand, but people here have connections! I found something else. A scooter. With its very own helmet too! By the way, this neighborhood is my turf! From this dumpster to that one, if I see any of you snooping around, expect my fist in your stomach! Good afternoon! Man! He took everything. Our luck absolutely sucks. Oh, come on! What's with him? You're going to sleep over there? Saltouh, we were just trying to look for something to eat in a garbage can. Logically, what's going to be the next course of action? - Well... - Meet investors? Tell your secretary to set you up for the next flight to Zurich on a private jet? Or sleep on the sidewalk? Let me get some shut-eye. Maybe I'll dream about something less humiliating than this crappy reality. Yes. That's right. Cry like little girls. Cry about the kingdom that you weren't men enough to save. There she is! So, Dana, what's the latest? By tomorrow it'll all be done, yes? Where is he? Where is Fazzee'? The goose that will make me a golden egg for the board of trustees? I must see him! Right here. - That's Fazzee'? - That is Fazzee'. Nawf, doesn't it look a little different from the presentation we approved a month ago? No, that wasn't the approved version. That's the one from the presentation. Yes! That's Fazzee'. Yes, that's Fazzee'! Masculine! Look at that body. Just look at those big arms! Dana, why does your prototype look so different? Don't worry, it will look like that eventually. We just want to check if the programming is working. Right now, this is the primordial exoskeleton. Okay, can it go for a test run now? Of course. Fazzee', the robot of the future. With the use of our advanced technologies, Fazzee' will always be connected, swiftly serving at your beck and call. You need a glass of water? Fazzee' is happy to fetch it for you. Your kids need a private tutor? Fazzee' can teach them! You've got a flat tire? Fazzee' will change it for you! Fazzee', the robot of the future at your fingertips. Nice. For now, try asking him to do something simple for you. Fazzee', fetch me that pen on the desk behind you. The red pen, please. Here you go. It can talk! Of course it can talk. Okay, I have to be somewhere now, but one last request before I go. Something a little more complex. Go ahead. Ask for whatever you want. Fazzee'... Here are my car keys. Go to the car and warm it up for me, the green Ford. Then wait for me there until I come down, okay? He actually found it! Bravo! Bravo, Dana! This is great. The board of trustees will be emotionally shocked, in a good way! Fazzee', shock the world! I guess he interpreted that one quite literally. Fazzee'. Get me a cab. Nawf, call the board of trustees and let them know we're delaying the meeting for... - Two weeks. - Two weeks. - Roger that. - Dana, I need you to take tomorrow off. I will be getting a lot of questions about... I'd rather not have you around. I will take responsibility for what happened. I am going to leave now. We'll stay in touch. - Hello. - Dana. Hello, Mother. On your way back, I'd like you to go to the grocery store and get some incense. - Sure. - Don't be late from work, your dad wants us to have dinner early. Don't count on me, it looks like I'll be back late tonight. Okay, then. Fazzee', return to the lab. If only I could fly Like birds Spread my wings Let go, and forget about everything Like butterflies The best stories And go to sleep And determine my destiny Oh, my dream, why do you drift away And make me run after you? Looking for you here and there I've been trying to achieve success For years now My life has gone by so fast I've been trying to achieve success For years now And my life, oh, my dream has gone by so fast. That's out of line! What's this? Since when do we use spears in this? No problem. You might've won the battle, but you haven't won the war. - So, did you find anything? - Wait... I feel something. What's that? I really hope it's not what I think it is! Chocolate. You're invited to The Society of Heroes with Extraordinary Abilities. Heroes with extraordinary abilities? The Society of Heroes with Extraordinary Abilities in Riyadh is now accepting applications and tryouts which... will be held at 9:00 a.m. on January 22 at the Riyadh Convention Center. That's tonight. Boys, this is our ticket out of this sad situation. The Society of Heroes with Extraordinary Abilities. A gathering of successful people. - We have to go. - Go with what? We don't have anything to present. What do we have to lose? From now on, we are "the Three Gorooms." Goroom? What's a "Goroom"? It means the courageous. The brave. The Three Gorooms means the three superheroes. But we're not superheroes. We have nothing to showcase. It's not like you're Iron Man... If the heroes of the world listened to the doubters, we would never sing the glories of Antara, or the struggles of Jassas Ibn Murrah, Amer Ib Tufail, Abu Kabeer Al Huthali, Duraird Ibn Al Summa, Saad Ibn Malik, Abu Neweira Al Taghnlubi, Rabeea Ibn Mokaddem Al Kinani... Amer Ibn Al Tufail, Abd Yaghouth Al Haritihi, Alnabegha Al Thubyani, Al Harith Ibn Halza Al Yashkari, Imru Al Qais, Turfa Ibn Al Abd, Zuhair Ibn Abi Salma, Lubaid Ibn Rabeea... We get your point! Okay. Why are you still asleep at this hour? I'm off work today. Well, get up, your aunts are coming in a bit. Here with us from Riyadh is Dr. Adel, the CEO of the Society of Heroes with Extraordinary Abilities in Saudi Arabia. Dr. Adel, good morning. Good morning, hello. Tonight is a big night for you. Yes, the event tonight will be comprised of different segments. Some of which will be updates on our latest news, and other segments will be tryouts for young people who want to apply for membership to our group. - Fantastic. - Crime rates have decreased lately, and I think that's due to... Dana, how are you? I tried reaching you, but it seems that your phone is off. Well... it seems that we have to put the Fazzee' project on hold. No! We are forced to take this decision. Maybe someday we will resume it. Take the week off. When you're back, we'll talk more. Take care. There will be disadvantages, naturally, but... I don't want people to feel that a high number of superheroes is an "unhealthy phenomenon." On the contrary, I hope that anyone who feels they can serve the community should not hesitate in trying out tonight at the big event. This is why I say we welcome everybody. The world will always need more superheroes. JOIN THE HEROES WITH EXTRAORDINARY ABILITIES CLUB WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? JOIN US BECOME A SUPERHERO Five minutes left before they open the application booths. See? People respect you when you're a superhero. Everybody is going to ask you for a selfie. One time, someone asked to take a selfie with me. They thought you were a Houthi rebel. Yeah, I remember the headlines that day about arresting a Houthi in the capital. That's not exactly the sort of selfie we're talking about, Abu Ghannam. Saltouh! As I live and breathe, what are you guys doing here? What are you doing here? I'm a volunteer with the organizers. - We're trying out as superheroes. - For real? Seriously? Man, the turnout is much bigger than I thought. Check out that superheroine over there. Do you know her? All you men should burn in hell! Don't you come near me! What are you looking at? Damn it! - What's up with her? - That's Captain Feminism. Her superpower is that she hates men. No man dares to talk to her! What about that guy she's talking to? That's Captain Domestic Chores. He's the only one she gives any attention to. What are you guys talking about? This doesn't concern you. Please, I want to know. I'll give you five riyals! Tell me! He's a pain in the neck, he has to know everything. He's "Captain Nosey." I swear, man! I saw him that day and all he was wearing was his underwear! No way! Really? I swear. Guys, stay right here, I'll be right back! So, where exactly is the application booth? See that tent over there? They're going to start accepting the submissions in a bit. But hey, where are your costumes? What costumes? Everyone is wearing a costume. These red curtains behind their backs. Look around you. Dr. Adel himself will be auditioning you. You better be ready. Well, good! Dr. Adel. He's a man of substance and intellect. He'll see what we've got before he judges us by our appearance. Rejected! Well... can we at least tell you what we've got? No costume, no tryout! - Give us a shot, man! - Security! Don't raise you voice, you grunt! Okay, we're leaving! Just a minute, just a minute. Listen to this, brother of Latifa. This is a warning, okay? What goes around comes around. You're dealt cards and we're dealt different cards. But trust me, I'll have your number one day. You see this business you're running? I'll wrap it up real good and I'll put it in my pocket. Get out! Even if I have to pull it out of your nose. Saad, that's your cue. Pulling it out of your nose. Are you done? Okay, you can go out now. Next. So, you call yourself "Captain Invisible Tiger." Yes, sir. Nice. Well, Invisible Tiger, show us what you've got. I am Captain Invisible Tiger. Lighter than a butterfly, quieter than a feather. With my superpower of hiding that I learned from my Tai Chi Asian arts, the criminals won't see me coming to ruin their malicious plans. Okay, show us your superpower. All of you now cannot see me. I have disappeared. I'm not buying it, I can still see you. No, you can't see me. I can see you. Okay, give me a second. - Now you can't see me. - I can still see you. Trust me, you don't see me. You're in plain sight! I can see you! Your mind is playing tricks on you. - Okay, get him out. - No, wait! Please give me one more chance! Okay, how about now? REJECTED Next. Okay, good sir, show us your extraordinary ability. Thanks. I specialize in financing for consumers. - Personal loans. - I don't follow. You know, I get people in debt with an added 15% to 20% interest. They pay it within five years. And when they are almost clear from the debt, bam! I sucker them into another loan. And if they have retirement money, I make them take a loan on it. What do you want exactly? Wait, isn't this the job offer to work for the bank? - Bank? - Yeah, the Development & Commerce Bank. No? Oh, yeah, no, that's at the Holiday Inn. - Okay! - Dammam Road. They told me it was at the Riyadh Convention Center. - But... - Maybe a different night. Okay. I... Honestly, I'll leave. - Of course, yes. No problem. - Okay, bye. - Okay, I'll go. - Goodbye. Need anything? Okay. REJECTED Next. Captain Wisdom, what do you have for us this evening? Okay, peace be upon you. My superpower is that I show people the right thing to do. You get closer and closer to the bad guy without him knowing that you're going in, then all of a sudden, I come in and say, "What are you doing? This is wrong." And just like that you shock him with that advice, so his muscles relax and he gets in a better mood. He calms down. So, you just give him good advice and he just complies? Yes, with good advice from my mantra "diplomacy first." Okay, I'm not against that, but... sometimes the context of the situation calls for "fighting fire with fire." Sir, I think we should try him out with the Goliath. Yes, that's a good idea. Bring out the Goliath! Okay, this is Mutleg the Goliath. He used to live in a village with a population of 150 people. He killed and ate them all in one night. Murder, suffocation, stabbing, dragging by the ankles, suicide. Suicide? Yeah, when he ran out of people to kill, he tried to kill himself. Go ahead, show us what you've got. Captain Wisdom! Who upset you, kiddo? REJECTED Last man trying out! Woman, sir. Sulayteen. Okay. Send her in. Dana? That's it? It's not Captain Dana or anything? But, Doctor, she's not wearing a superhero costume. That's true, Sulayteen. But every rule has its exceptions. Besides, a person is judged by their essence, not their appearance. - That scoundrel! - Damn him to hell. Who's that with you, Dana? Is it your robo-guardian? No, sir. This is Fazzee'. A robot. One of my own inventions. I can control him with my smartphone. Interesting! I'm a robotics engineer and an AI programmer. I feel that with my expertise, I can create technological advances that can help you fight crime. Does Fazzee' speak English? Hello, Fazzee'. How are you? - Can we use it as a weapon? - No, I had something else in mind. Or wear it like Iron Man to make me stronger? - Maybe, but... - Okay, let me try. Fazzee', I want you to whip that thing. Fazzee'! Stop! What are you doing? I created Fazzee' to help people, build things, and do good things! Not to whip people and destroy things! But we need weapons. We're okay, we use them for a good cause. Captain D, I'm sorry. It seems I don't have a chance with you. Maybe this is all a mistake. I hope you don't take it the wrong way. On the contrary, you've done so much for the community. It's not my place to give you advice. But... saving the world can take shape in many different forms. I really wanted to be a member, but... it seems that I don't belong here. Anyway, I don't have to wear a superhero costume to do good, so, goodbye. Dana! Do you know how to cook? No. Okay. That's a bummer. REJECTED We tried giving her a chance, but sadly, this is the best a girl can do in our male-dominated society. All these years! All these years we've been trying to fight for women's rights and raise awareness! For every two steps forward we make, you take us four steps back! Calm down, Captain Domestic Chores! That's it! I'm heading over to my parents' house! To people who respect me and stand up for my honor! Okay, can you see me now? Of course I can't see you, man. It's because you're covering my eyes. God, it's like no matter how many times I practice, I can't seem to get my stealth abilities right. It's okay, buddy. Don't let it get you down. If you try hard enough, you're okay, you'll make it someday. Ladies and gentlemen, civilians and superheroes, please turn your attention to the main stage. Ever since the dawn of history, the world has been split into good and evil. There are those who choose the path of vice, hatred and destruction, and on the other hand there is... Captain D! I'm worried he'll get burned! Oh, my God! Captain D! Captain D! Oh, my God! Fireworks! Look at that! Captain D looks great! Thank you. Thank you very much. Truthfully, this has been the best year for the Society of Heroes with Extraordinary Abilities since its inception. We have two amazing announcements for the lovers of good and justice. The first announcement is that we stopped a major terrorist act. Over here we have the dangerous, criminal weapon which we successfully took away from the terrorists before they could use it against innocent civilians. Yes, it is very scary! It's a biological weapon that could have infected an enormous number of victims! But, with the grace of God first, then with my efforts second, and with the efforts of my peers at the club, of course, we managed to extract the weapon, and it is now in safe hands. The other good news is related to the decrease in crime in the city of Riyadh! As you can see, the crime rate has hit an all-time low. - Did you ask why? - Nobody asked why! It is because of our enormous success in defeating 99% of all evil. Yeah! Just like Dettol! Yes! We are the Dettol of crime! So I bid you adieu and say, sleep without a worry in the world, friends! With our efforts, evil has no place in the world! You defeated all crime, huh? You're so tough! My entire life I planted the seeds! You all reap what you sow! 99%, huh? Impressive! How did you do the math? There's 1% left. And that 1% is going to give you a thousand headaches! You and those "peers" of yours. Bandar! Show yourself, you coward! So, you want to see me? Check above you, you twerp, you shrimp, you... On the left, you dunce. Look here! You're locking eyes with the sun! You think you've got it all! How cute! No! AlMuthi! - Calm down, guys. - Ladies and gentlemen! No need to worry! Calm down! Calm down! Wait! Oh, no! Captain Logic. What do you want now? I can't help but ask. You have a biological weapon in a public place in front of the entire country. Don't you think a picture in a PowerPoint presentation would've been less risky? Oh, really? Why don't you shut up, wise guy? AlMuthi has a biological weapon now. - We're in so much trouble. - We're all going to be eaten alive! No! Please calm down! Control yourselves! Hit it. I sang from the rooftops A loud cry that went over your heads You'll bite your fingernails and freak out After kicking me out of your party I'm a big deal in the underworld And I'm allergic to preachy advice Tyrants put in a good word for me The one-stop shop of diabolical harm Hitler and I were childhood friends Genghis Khan was like a brother to me Here we go Raised among ferocious beasts I'm the alpha and I'll eat you alive I'll rip out your livers and eat them I'll starve you all to death Ghouls and ghosts have no one to haunt They're all amateurs compared to me - In your face! - Break it down. My crimes are as real as death This ain't no rumor and I'm no myth This superhero stuff is too much for us. Boys. Cut your losses and go back to your homes. What home? I mean, let's go back to the cafeteria... Oh, I forgot we don't have the cafeteria anymore! This sucks. This was our chance, but it had to be ruined by Mr. Hippo. - Mr. Hippo? - Captain D! What's that guy's superpower anyway? He has a PhD! He's mentally ill! He's arrogant! - Did you see what he did? - Ew! God have mercy. It's good I wiped the floor with him. "Please! Calm down! Please control yourselves!" Hold on right there. Don't praise the bad guys if you have a problem with the good guys! He can bite me! Yeah, hail AlMuthi! I'm his biggest fan! My advice is, let's always look on the bright side. This whole club of superheroes is a load of crap. They'll make anyone a superhero. If you notice, Captain D's standards for a superhero are very low. Anyone can start a club like his. Or even a better club. What are you thinking? I can manufacture robots! You, what's your superpower? I disappear. Okay. I can work on some technology that can help you with that. And you? What can you do? God gave me the talent of good advice and motivation. A great speech can have an effect on people. And you guys, what are your superpowers? - She's talking to you, Saltouh. - Don't ask me! - Saad, answer her! - I don't talk to girls! Okay, no problem. Baby steps. We'll find something. What I'm trying to say is, Captain D established a big club with talentless members, no offense. None taken. Thank you for being kind. I propose we make our own club of superheroes. Wait, guys! I have a great idea! Let's establish our own superhero club! - I just said that. - You're a genius, old dog! Guys, remember this moment! Remember this place! Today I announce the creation of our superhero club, "the Extraordinary Gorooms." But, before we start, as early as tomorrow morning, if there's one thing we learned from our experience tonight, the most important thing, the first building block that everything else is based on, what is it? WOMEN'S TAILOR What do you guys think? They gave me wings. I am Captain Shaheen! Saad, how's your breathing? Good. Okay, so we just checked the clothes off the list. Now, the next step is meeting the sponsor who will fund the club. - Sponsor? - Of course, what did you expect? Starting a superhero club requires capital, buddy! Who's going to give us capital? Don't worry, I know a guy who owes me a favor. What is this? The bill. Ashraf, I don't have cash or a credit card, I'll pay you next week. STCPay. Et tu, Brutus? Peace be upon you. To the location I sent you, buddy. - Are you waiting for anyone? - No, just us. Hit the road. Does anybody want to sit in the front? Why would we want that? I don't know, it feels like I'm a chauffeur if no one's in the front. - You are a chauffeur. - Excuse me! I'm a "captain"! Okay. You're talking to Turad, a professor specializing in information technology. Over here we have Dr. Saltouh, a brain surgeon. And over here, we have Mr. Saad Ghannam, PhD Double Major - in Linguistics and Pronunciation. - Excuse me? And you're a "captain," and this is an Airbus. Take it to the skies, Captain! - Good morning! - Hello, good morning. Dana seems to be in a great mood today. I hope it lasts forever. I'll go ask her why. No, don't ask. The most important thing is that she's happy today. THE EXTRAORDINARY GOROOMS CLUB Yes! Is Saleh available? We have a meeting with him. No, actually, thank you for coming. Corporate responsibility is a big deal with us. You don't have to sell yourselves, your reputation sells you enough. This is a win for us. That's very kind of you, Abu Basma. So, we pretty much looked at everything. We did the math, a seven-year forecast. Cash in, cash out. Due diligence. Airtight. I'm pretty sure we will make you look good. All this is not necessary, Turad. I'll give these papers to Mr. Mustard. It's all in the papers. We need a new HQ. A new superhero vehicle. Coffee, office supplies, tea boy. You know, miscellaneous items. Basically, the annual budget we're asking for is a little over 12 million riyals. Very well. Ketchupa, take this proposal from Mr. Mustard, and draft up the contract so we can sign it right now. We're signing right now? Yeah, he who gives fast, gives twice. Let's strike while the iron's hot and get it over with. How's the old man? He's doing great, thanks for asking, my old man is great. So, I saw the event you guys did last night on TV. Record-breaking attendance, very impressive. How did it go? - Event? - Yeah. The Society of Heroes with Extraordinary Abilities. The one in the Riyadh Convention Center. - Oh, no, that's not ours. - Excuse me? That's the Society of Heroes with Extraordinary Abilities. We're different, we're the Extraordinary Gorooms. Mr. Mustard, please ask Ketchupa to hold everything. We have nothing to do with them. We're very different from them. Wait, you're not reps from Dr. Adel? No, man! We're different. What's wrong, Abu Basma? Okay, this is what we can offer. As it pertains to the vehicle... Mr. Mustard, can you please bring me specimen 14 from Dr. Talal? Thank you. As it pertains to the vehicle... This is the key to a car you'll find in the parking lot. It's all yours. As for the cash, sorry, but I can't justify that amount to the board. No! Don't say that, man! Throw me a bone, dude! As for the HQ, we have an old warehouse in an old industrial zone. We don't really use it. It's yours. As a beginning, this should start things off fairly. What... What is this? This is our new offer to you. A car, HQ, and one free sandwich for life. This is what it came to? A sandwich? Not just any sandwich. This is tortilla. - May I? - Sure, help yourself. The heart yearns And the stomach is a willing slave You fill up existence with magnificence With that tasty sauce and that cheese Tortilla, I've never seen anyone like you I'm consumed with hunger when I see you The saliva in my mouth dances Then it turns into rain -And fight for you till my last breath -Till my last breath! I'll race against the ticking clock And fight for you till my last breath I'll race against the ticking clock Deal! This car sucks. Saad... you heard of Model Roz? I salute you. I swear to God, you're the man. You work so hard, you're a baller. I swear you're better than all the kings of crime. The stuff you do, you can drink all their blood. You can chew bullets. Your dinner table is the back of a dead corpse, and you can have lunch... Man, this is what you're all about! Look at that bicep, it's like a mountain. And look at that bald head. There's a bull in our village called... Himran. Your head is like the head of our bull Himran. You're the real deal. Look where we started and where we are now. We're in the big leagues, about to unleash a hazardous bio weapon. As the great poet Drake once said, "Started from the bottom, now we're here." Mane', do you know why we do all this? Because cleanliness is part of our faith, boss. Oh, my! Rubber ducky, what do you think of this dunce rubbing my back right now? It's a whole lot of nothing inside that head, nothing but empty soda cans! Come on! Can't you see the bigger picture? I'm talking about all these crimes against humanity and trees and rocks and stuff. - Get with the program! - Bless your heart, Abu Ghada! It looks like you're asking a rhetorical question. It's because of your dad, may he rest in peace. I don't deserve to be treated like this, Mane'. I do a lot of charity work. I dig wells. I get people released, you know, I bail people out of prison. I give money to poor children. I do everything! And it's always like, "Hey, look at the trust-fund kid with Daddy's money." Always Daddy's money! What the f-freelance! Trust-fund kid, huh? How dare they! I swear, Mane', I never asked for anything. All I wanted was for people to like me! I'm so kind. You know how big my heart is! I swear! I swear to God! I will be the worst thing that ever happened to them! I will chew them up and spit them out! They don't know who they're... You know what? Man, if they only... You'll see school curriculums talk about my pure evil! They will compare me to Hitler, Mussolini, Genghis Khan. You'll see! But why not be remembered like Gandhi or Mandela or Omar Al Mukhtar? Well, let me ask you, wise guy. Imagine you're stranded in the desert, okay? Are you paying attention or should I put my finger in your mouth? Anyway, you're in the desert and a bunch of bandits surround you, who would you rather be? That wimp Gandhi who'd just stand there getting beaten up? Or would you be like the mighty Genghis Khan? I would be like Genghis Khan! Ahhgh! Genghis Khan! It is settled then. Get everything ready. Tomorrow will be a day no one will ever forget. You all dare think you buried my name? I am inevitable, like Judgment Day. Since the day we met, I've been feeling so safe around you. HEROES WITH EXTRAORDINARY ABILITIES Where is Adel? Darling? Buthayna? Where did you go? Buthayna? Bathboothi, where did you go? Don't make me miss you too much, it makes me sad. Darling! I've been calling for an hour. Why aren't you answering? This is the biggest disaster I've ever seen in my life, you rascal! The biological weapon was in your possession and it only took 24 hours before it slipped right through your fingers? Rest assured, everything is under control! Where is the weapon? - We'll find it! - You better find it! Otherwise people will have a hard time finding your corpse! Hello, kiddo. Tutu, darling, what have I told you about keeping the gate open? Of course the cat would get out. Okay, I'll send some helicopters to scan the area and they'll find it for you. What else? A SAWA card? Okay, I'll just recharge it for you with the MySTC app. I love you too. Bye-bye. I need refreshments! We're in a state of emergency! Everyone's breathing down my neck! Bring the blender now! It's all under control. Getting AlMuthi is easy. We'll retrieve the weapon and get him. Sulayteen. What's the ETA, based on our intel? 24 hours, sir. That's great! See? - Get me my medication! - Not feeling well, Abu Hussam? Headache? There's a fever going around these days, everyone is getting it. Listen, 24 hours! You don't deserve to sit on that chair, you understand? If it wasn't for your uncle, to whom I owe a lot of favors, you tested my patience! And I covered for you a lot and I've had it! But now I can smell your stink from a mile away. Bring in the mattress! - Mattress? - Yes, mattress. You think I'm leaving you alone here? I'm seeing this through, just like I see through your bones. But, Abu Hussam, you need to be with Tutu. I can take care of everything. It's not good for your health to sleep at my office. This fat-bellied baldy is okay. Tell me what's good for my health! You give it a try and see for yourself if it's bad for your health. Bring mattresses for two! Saad! Do you copy? Over and out! - Huh? - Don't "huh" me! Are you done cleaning up? My back hurts! It's okay! Hurt your back and don't hurt our flowery dreams, Abu Ghannam! So, any news on AlMuthi? - No trace of him. - Did you check on Instagram? Nothing. Okay, what's trending on Twitter? #WouldYouMarryAWidow? Yeah, I wouldn't mind! Saad, would you marry a widow? Who the hell died and made you emperor? Saad, every organizational structure comprises of the brain and the muscle. Who could that be? - Who invited them? - I invited them. Captain Hajooza called me and said, "Send me the location now." His name is Captain Wisdom. You racist! No, it's not like that at all! Some people never change. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. Look at this! I see you have an HQ all to yourselves, and you rolled up your sleeves and got to work right away. Oh, yeah. No pain no gain, homie! That's the spirit. Here's a box full of peanut butter. Peanut butter? Do we look like monkeys? Not at all. These are peanuts. Protein. So you can build those superhero muscles. Saad needs to build his muscles. Abu Ghannam, is this true? You need to build up muscle? Okay, we accept your gift. And this is the logo of our club. Dana, bless her heart, designed it. Who asked you to make logos for our club? Who asked us? Yeah, we don't need your services. Excuse me? I said we don't need you. I know this is awkward, but I think clarity is important. Cooler heads, everybody. We discussed that we're starting our own club together, remember? No! We're the ones who worked hard to secure funding and set this whole HQ up, while you were all snoozing like babies. How could you do this to us? I didn't do anything to you, I just don't want to work with you, that's all. Feel it! Feel the burn! Not like that, Saad! You don't carry it. You're supposed to eat it! You think you're better than Captain D, but you're doing the same thing you criticized him for! You're no different than him. Actually, he's better than you! At least he has a real club! I'm not saying I'm above him, but at the same time I can't blame him. People only work with people who can add value to them. I'm sorry that life is unfair. I mean, just a couple of days ago, we got evicted from our cafeteria, and suddenly, without any warning we became homeless. So, I'm sorry, we have no vacancies for you here. Okay, what about me? Is there a vacancy for me? No, there are no vacancies. Good luck. People are so distant from me Even though we're so much alike I'm lost inside a maze of emotions And happy days pass by without me I'm a simple girl who has nothing to prove To those who know me Or to those who don't I have my own hopes, O Lord And my own ambitions And I'm all right I just wish I was understood What they see as tales Of success and heroes I see it simply as it is My dreams are bigger Than the Sarawat Mountains But they can't come true without your help I want to live and to give every day How you want me Is not how I want myself to be My loss is truly a loss if I lived My life with you but not with myself It's all good. We'll be there in five minutes. Very good. Most importantly, is everything packed up? Everything is packed. Don't worry, it's going to be fine. They'll say you destroyed everything and everybody. No, Mane'. They've barely seen anything yet. Don't underestimate our opponents. Okay, so why are we going to Al Olaya again? - Are you stupid? - Why? Of course we'll go to downtown Riyadh, it's crowded with little kids and infants. Plus, the real estate there is expensive. I want to destroy expensive stuff, unlike your cheap face. Dear passengers, please have your chairs straightened to the upright position in preparation for landing. We are ready. #ALMUTHI Guys! Hello, everybody! So, today we have the unboxing of a very dangerous biological weapon that will hopefully kill a lot of people. Very cool stuff. Sir, we found him! It's fast and effective, and the second it hits you, you die. You can see how lux the black packaging is. We have the warranty here, a ten-year warranty. If no one dies, - you can get your money back. - Where's he at? It's not showing where! I know how to find him. - What the hell is he doing? - He's doing an unboxing video, sir. - Did you triangulate his position? - On top of the Mamlaka Tower, sir! You know, there is an Italian restaurant there that makes the best fettuccine. What are you waiting for, damn it? Fix your mistake! Assemble your squad and take action! Don't forget, guys. Plan A is we disarm the weapon and we capture AlMuthi alive! - You ran him over! - What about Plan A? No time for Plan A! Switch to Plan Z! Run him over again! Sir, the Mamlaka Tower is in ruins. Small price to pay to secure a biological weapon that can kill millions! Anyway, at least the Al Faisaliah Tower is undamaged! Should I break them up? No, not yet. Let them have fun. The weapon is not in the briefcase. Pardon me. Please hand over the weapon you have. Finally... only because I hold the power now... Nafe', the admiral himself, is talking to me, acknowledging my existence. Have we met before? Who are you? Based on the way you treated me before, I am nothing. But now that the tables have turned, it seems I've become everything now. That's just because of the weapon you have! True, no shame in that. The world only respects the powerful. Please surrender the weapon. Don't let the situation get any worse or become an inconceivable catastrophe! Give me my medication! Abu Husam, do you seriously want to reason with it? Shut the hell up! No! It's got another weapon! The red bee! Adel! Fazzee'! I know that you are weary. I know how miserable life may seem. I know that all you want is for people to like you and acknowledge your existence. But what are you going to do about it? Tell me. Do you think violence is the answer? Only the weak are spiteful and vindictive. The strong, however, are gracious and forgiving. Clearly, you have made your choice, and I can't stop you. But if you can give me a chance to say one last thing before we all die. I don't know you, but, by God, I love you. Carry on, my friend, I forgive you. You? Aren't you the one who suckers people into those predatory loans? Yeah, it's me, but thank God, when I left your office the other day, I met this Good Samaritan. He gave me pretty good advice and I've been helping the Red Crescent and at the aquifer wells in Africa ever since. Oh, my God! There he is. And finally, Dr. Adel saves the day! Good evening. This is the nine o'clock news. Damages estimated in the billions for the city's infrastructure, as several neighborhoods were evacuated in downtown Riyadh. But the heroes have contained the crisis as they apprehended the criminal. Chicken pox? Chicken pox, damn you! Well, Abu Husam, chicken pox is still a biological weapon. Do you want me to tell the world we destroyed two of our landmark buildings because of chicken pox? - Theatrics is part of the job. - What? What's that medal you got there? Medal of courage and valor of the highest order. Remind me, why were you awarded this medal? Because I stopped the biggest anthrax attack in history! Ras Abu Gamys, 1995. - You were with us, you idiot! - I don't think so. - Say again? - It wasn't anthrax! It was just a tiny virus that causes diarrhea, a couple of bottles of water and you would feel better. Diarrhea? Well, we exaggerated the case so you could have... that lovely trinket around your neck. I wore this to my father's funeral. Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed dignitaries, good evening. Thank you for attending tonight's ceremony, for participating in this celebration, a celebration of virtue and valor and courage. Despite all that we have lost, we are celebrating victory over evil, thanks to the Society of Heroes with Extraordinary Abilities. Please show your gratitude and give some passionate applause for the heroes that saved our city from total annihilation. Captain D And Captain Nafe'. Damn you and your fake accomplishments! Man, we were the ones who saved the city! I was the one that ran AlMuthi over and over and over until he was mush. Right, Saad? - Saltouh! - Man, forget about it! It's obvious, it's a scripted conspiracy. Some people are benefiting from this and don't want you ruining it for them. Good morning, sick people. What is it with this guy? Is he dead? Sister! Record the time of death, quarter past eleven. No, cancel, the vermin is alive. They are clinging on to life as if they were cockroaches. And you! How is your broken beak today? Can you fix it, Doctor? We don't know yet. We put it up for a bid with three contractors. They will open the envelopes tomorrow to see who has the best offer. Excellent. Are you satisfied now? Did you come here to gloat? I'm here to check up on you. Why? Because that's the right thing to do. Let me tell you a story. There was once a poor man who provided for his wife and four kids. They survived a year of hunger they'd never been through before. One day, the father decided to go hunting. Maybe he'd come back with something to feed his kids. He looked everywhere, looking for anything to hunt, until he fell down face first with exhaustion. Then, he opened his eyes and saw a gazelle. He tightened his grip, stood up and aimed his arrow. The first arrow, he missed. The strange thing is that the gazelle didn't move. The hunter quickly set up his second arrow, but as he was about to shoot, he saw a baby gazelle behind the tree. The baby gazelle looked like it had collapsed. Its leg was stuck in something. Its mother couldn't leave him. Here, the hunter was conflicted. Should he kill this baby gazelle's mother? Or go back empty-handed to his kids? The hunter put his arrow down, stepped up to the baby gazelle, and freed its leg from where it was stuck. The baby skipped away with its mother and disappeared from the hunter's sight. The hunter looked at them with a smile, but the smile quickly faded away the minute he remembered his kids. He looked to the floor in shame and a tear fell from his eye. He opened his eyes and noticed the rock where the baby gazelle's leg was stuck. It turned out to be a gigantic piece of gold. And from that day onwards, he and his kids never felt any hunger again. May I ask you a question, Dana? Go ahead. What's the name of this day-care center? - What? - This day-care center, what is it called? What day-care center? We're at a hospital! Good girl! Since this is a hospital and not a day-care center, do we look like infants for you to tell us bedtime stories? You said it yourself. We have to eat dirt, then we'll find gold! Well, we ate the dirt, and now it's all said and done we're still eating dirt! I want my gold. Saad, do you want gold? Saltouh, where's our gold? Man, shut the hell up. Where's our gold? No, I won't be satisfied until I get what I deserve! - What are you doing? - Be patient and you'll see. - Who are you calling? - Give me a minute. Hello, are you the damned mayor? How are you, sir? Regarding the wrong people that you honored... Let me finish! We're the black sheep in the flock. I understand you only want prestigious, high-class people! But give people their dues! What do you want from us? We did all the right things! Acknowledge us for once! Thank us, you ungrateful jerks! Yes, correct. Yes, sir. No, okay, I am the one who should apologize for raising my voice. That's so kind of you, God bless you. I'm sorry for cussing you out. Okay. Bye. What did he say? We are all set, guys. Finally it's time to reap the fruits of our labor. The mayor says as soon as we are out of the hospital, we can expect a suitable reward that reflects our accomplishments. Honestly, I have conflicted feelings. I'm not sure if I should feel proud or ashamed. THE THREE GOROOMS
