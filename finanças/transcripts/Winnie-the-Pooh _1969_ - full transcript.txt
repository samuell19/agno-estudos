Butyrina Chapter 1: we are introduced to Winnie-the-Pooh and some suspicious bees A very long time ago, about last Friday there lived a bear cub under the name of Winnie-the-Pooh "under the name" because he had the name over the door, and lived under it Once, Winnie-the-Pooh went to the forest to have a snack He was always ready for a snack He was also a poet, and wrote poems and even songs - not unlike this one... Pum-purum-param... If I scratch my head it's no big deal My head is full of sawdust yes indeed Despite the sawdust my songs as well as rhymes, verses, and poems I compose well enough sometimes, yea! Winnie-the-Pooh is full of joy that is why he sings aloud And no matter what he does - as long as he loses no weight which he won't lose - as long as he has a snack, yea! Very Tall Oak That buzzing-noise means something The tree can't make a buzzing-noise so somebody else must be buzzing The only reason to buzz is because you're a bee And what are bees for? To make honey, I think And what is honey for? So that I could eat it! That's right If bears were bees, they'd build their nests at the bottom of trees If the bees were bears, we shouldn't have to climb up all these stairs Isn't it funny How a bear likes honey? Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! I wonder why he does? Winnie-the-Pooh went to see his best friend, the Piglet who lived in a house under a sign "Trespassers W" Who was that "Trespassers W", even the Piglet didn't know Good morning, Winnie-the-Pooh Good morning, Piglet I wonder if you have such a thing as a balloon about you? - A balloon? - Yes. I was just wondering if you might have one What do you want a balloon for? - Honey. - What? - Honey. - But you don't get honey with balloons! - I do Piglet was at Rabbit's place just the day before and he had 2 beautiful balloons: a blue and a green one Which one would you like? When you go after honey, it's good not to let the bees know you're coming If you have a green balloon, they might take you for a leaf, and not notice you with a blue balloon, they'd think you were part of the sky, and not notice you Wouldn't they notice you underneath the balloon? They might or they might not I shall try to look like a small black cloud. That will deceive them Then you better take the blue balloon Where Piglet and I are going is a secret which we won't reveal, no-no-... Oh! - Do you have an umbrella? - An umbrella? Yes, I just thought: shouldn't we bring an umbrella just in case? - You never can tell with bees - Yep Where Piglet and I are going is a secret which we won't reveal, no-no-... Oh! Hold this Now I look like a real black cloud Where Piglet and I are going is a secret which we won't reveal, no-no-... Oh? - No. Blow it up. - Okay Let go! - Hooray! - Isn't that fine? - What do I look like? - Like a Bear holding on to a balloon - Not like a small black cloud in a blue sky? - Not very much Well, perhaps from up here it looks different. You never can tell with bees "Honey" - Piglet! - Yes? - I think the bees suspect something! - What sort of thing? I don't know. But something tells me that they're suspicious! Perhaps they think that you're after their honey? - Piglet, I think they don't believe I'm a black cloud. - What shall we do? Walk around with the umbrella. I'll be singing a cloudy song... and you look at me and repeat: "Tut-tut, it looks like rain" - Okay Tut-tut, it looks like rain Tut-tut, it looks like rain... Tut-tut, it looks like rain... How sweet to be a black cloud! Every little cloud always sings aloud - Piglet! - It looks li... what? I've been thinking, and I got it: these are the wrong sort of bees Quite the wrong sort. So they would make the wrong sort of honey I shall come down It looks like rain... How? I haven't thought about this - It looks like rain... - Piglet! - What? - Have you got a gun at home? - Yes. - Bring it quickly! Sweet to be a cloud floating in the blue It makes him proud to be a little cloud - Piglet!! - Over here! - Shoot! - What are you shooting at? - At the bees of course Not at bees, shoot the balloon But if I do that, it will spoil the balloon But if you don't that would spoil me! - Ow!... - Did I miss? You didn't exactly miss, but you missed the balloon I'm so sorry Pooh... One can't say for sure, but maybe that's why he was always called Pooh Isn't it time to have a snack? I think it is! That's the end of this story, but there are others About Pooh and Rabbit and Piglet and the Old Grey Donkey and the others The End
