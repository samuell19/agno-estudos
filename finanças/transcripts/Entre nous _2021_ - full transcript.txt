Why are you here? Elodie had another crisis. She's in the hospital, I don't know what happened. I'm leaving. Meet me there, OK? Okay go! I'll be there soon. BETWEEN US One year ago... So cute. What would you do if you were her? With a black rabbit? I don't know. Stop. It's not nice. So why are you having fun with a little white rabbit then? What do you think? I don't know. I'm getting a drink. Would you like a tea or an infusion? Yes. I want a huge black coffee. Don't be silly. You know, your heart... I know, you don't need to remind me all the time. Well... You know, tomorrow I meet our potential flatmates. We don't have to find a flatmate. You changed your mind again. It's too late... - Fuck. - I already have a lot of appointments anyway. There is no rush. - What? - Yeah. There is no rush? You know I can't afford our expenses alone. My shop, the rent and your studies. We've had this talk a million times, Laeti. Sorry. But We don't have to admit anyone in our lives. So do you want me to fire Magalie? - That's it. - If there is no choice Why do you take everything so lightly? You ask for my opinion. - It's easy for you. - No. Yes. You're free as a bird. You do whatever you want, whenever you want. I'm here, I'm stuck and I'm in debt. Is this a reproach? Just too much stress. Sorry. I'm sorry. I could work. No, I know you, you'll lose your way again. You have to finish your studies. That's the most important thing. All right. Do we choose boy or girl? We will choose someone responsible, with a job. And if they are discreet, even better. So a boy. Of course. No, we could also find a discreet girl. Okay, do you know any discreet girl? Imagine the situation, every morning, three women waiting for their turn to invade the bathroom. It's hard, I know. I'm going to take a shower, it won't be long. I know you, you're going to be in the bathroom for hours Imagine having one more person around. You'll go crazy. - Laetitia. - Sorry. You are late. Sit down, everything is ready. I remind everyone and Laetitia who has just arrived. You are doing a proportional work, so you draw your axis line on which you will put eight heads for the value of the body. And from there, you can position the model. The time today... The pose is a bit longer so you have time to adjust the shape of the model and remember to add the shadows. Pay attention. You are here to learn how to observe more than to draw. I can see if your eyes are not looking at the model. There is something physical. Think about your model too, fullness and emptiness are also important, don't be afraid. Look, there is a beautiful shadow on the floor. Position the axis of the feet as well, it will give dynamism to your drawing. Two girls living here? Great. Cool, I accept. Wait a moment. I don't decide on my own. We'll call you. Quickly, I have many options. Okay. Can I invite people? Invite people? To make ends meet. I'm joking, it's not what you think. I'm a beautician. You scared me. Don't worry. 20 euros for make-up and 10 euros for bikini waxing. For you it's free, obviously. For both of you. So? Is that a yes? Actually I'll be honest, I'm married and my lover is in the military, we see each other every weekend. You know, meeting in a hotel is creepy. In the long run, I think it would tarnish our relationship. Do you have any problem with homosexuality? No. I can pay a little more if that's necessary. Don't worry, thank you. I studied psychology in Paris. I didn't have any friends, well, just some people I knew. I realised that I had never used what I learned. So I'm trying to get closer to a friendly world that could be a model of cognitive approach, without being a voyeur. What an odd reason to find a flatshare... Odd? Why? Look, my girlfriend and I are in a simple, sincere and unequivocal love relationship. We won't participate in your experiment. Keep sleeping, you look tired. Yes. It's crazy. Nobody is compatible. I told you it would be difficult, but when you want something... You didn't faint at least? No, but I'm very tired. I'll see the cardiologist next month. Finally. I have many things to do. Time flies. And you know I don't like doctors. Yes, I know. Yeah. I couldn't do all the things that you do for us. Well, do you want a whisky? Yes, I do. With ice. - Are you waiting for someone? - Yes, the last candidate. - I'll get the door. - Okay. Whisky for everyone. No, thank you. I never drink alcohol. - Never? - No, never. Never say never. I don't smoke either. Never. Great, it was my next question. Are you working or studying? Both. What do you study? A master's degree in philosophy. I also write. And what is your job? I do magic tricks in a cabaret, Mademoiselle B. Great! We love cabarets. We haven't been there in a long time. Well, I could invite you. Yes. It can be interesting for our privacy, he works at night, sleeps in the morning, in the afternoon he's at college. And he's not here on weekends. Honestly, it's perfect. Great. Maybe we can adopt him. Do you want to try? You must try guys before you adopt them. Let's go. Stop it now, Elodie. You can't treat me like crap just because I'm your employee. I have many problems. It's not a reason. It's hard. My life is hard too and I don't blame on you. You don't understand. Good morning. - Hi, Roity. - Hi. - All right, honey? - Yes. Is Laeti in her class? Close your eyes, I have a surprise for you. Can I help you? Look! All new! All brand new! Diesel, Levi's... Do you like them? - Where did you find them? - You know I can't tell you. Sure. But the cops will come to my shop. It was only once, it's okay. Of course, it's okay for you. Did you think about it? About what? Having a baby. What do you think about it? It's not a good time. Of course it's a good time. You are the perfect age for a baby. Listen, there are many children in the world who are starving, abused and sick. If I ever have a child, it will be an adopted one. And only if Laeti agrees. But that won't happen anytime soon, trust me. But there are many women who live like you who raise a child and sometimes more. And who love each other because love is beautiful. All a child needs is love. Can you speak louder? - Do you like it? - No, I don't. What about insemination? It's practical because it's anonymous. Just in case you don't find a suitable guy. And then there is custody, an important issue. Can we talk later? I can take care of the child while you work. Goodbye, Mrs. RÃ©mi. - See you next week. - Great, thanks. She is beautiful. Look, can we talk about this later? This is not the time nor the place to discuss such things. Sure. Listen, you should have a child now. Magalie, for the photo session you can call me whenever you want. Cool, I'll call you. Insemination or adoption. My bag. Bye. See you. - Bye, Roity. - Bye. I'll tell a story, a love story. Once upon a time, a man and a woman met and became more than friends But just apparently, just apparently... Behave like a man. Be a man. Naughty. Take off my clothes, it's clear. Come on. And you, take off your clothes. And as every night, we can enjoy magic and passion with the great magician Simon. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Mademoiselle B, we'll have a great time. You are charming, milady. Let me start by offering you this rose... which is just an illusion. But to fix this injustice to your charm, let me try to give you a new gift. Thank you. Now I'll tell you a story, a love story. Once upon a time, a man and a woman met and became more than friends Your room. Very nice, I like it. - Now the bathroom. - Sure. The bathroom. All right. Nice library. Carl Gustav Jung. Are you a psychologist? Yes, I studied psychology. The Peter Pan syndrome. Who is Tinkerbell? Take a guess. Are you married? No, engaged. Well, are you interested in the flat or not? We're fine with you moving in. I have an answer. Yes. Do you intend to move in on the first of the month? - No, tonight. - Tonight? Any problem? No, but can you bring all your stuff today? I have a backpack, a magic bag and some books. The rest is at home, in the countryside. - The countryside. Great. - Yes, at my parents' house. No cats, no dogs and that's all. 300 for the deposit, 300 for the current month's rent. Is that right? No, less. Today is the 20th. Here, take it. That money is yours. Please, keep it. An advance for next month. So for next month, you'll only give me 200 euros. - Great. - Perfect. Welcome, Simon. Great, let's go. You should take a break, Elodie. The doctor said I can practice sport. I just have to be careful. She also said that I shouldn't pursue the idea of having a child. I have a heart condition. But it's not definitive, we will fight. Do you think I don't fight? I just don't complain. She also said that I have hormonal disorders due to my heart treatment. It's irreversible. I'd better stop lying to myself. I must decide. No way. You're still studying, we'll wait, that's it. Do we want a child or not? I can have one. You or me, it doesn't matter, does it? We should do it while we're young. Insemination is anonymous. No need to deal with a guy. Roity would be happy, you speak exactly like him. Well, he's right. Don't you want to adopt? No, I don't. I want to feel the baby moving inside me. Can we change the subject? Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I feel like the magician comes from a different planet. He cleans the flat with us, but what else does he do? Hello, good evening, yes, no, thank you. And his food in the fridge? Just liquids. Does he eat liquids? And all those seeds. So weird. He refuses all our invitations, don't you think that's weird? I don't know. I find him neither annoying nor invasive. It's a big advantage. An advantage? I prefer a guy with whom we can share an evening, a dinner, a restaurant, I don't know, a good time. A more sociable guy. Sociable? He arrives from work at 4 a.m. Would you feel like being sociable? It's funny, you always defend him. He's been living with us for 3 months and we don't know anything about him. It may be better this way. - He scares me. - What? - I don't know, I have a weird feeling about him. - Why? Why do you always defend him? - You always point out his flaws, so... - Here we go again. Let's go. What's this? Harry, this is Elodie. Elodie, this is Harry. Harry did a good job at the cabaret tonight, he deserved those spaghetti, he loves them. Don't be afraid, Harry. He is named after Harry Houdini, the creator of modern magic. - I don't know him. - Elodie is not bad, but she's not part of our family yet. Our family? Our family? You should have told us about your rat. Come on, give Harry a kiss. - Gross, kissing a rat. - Don't be afraid. Come here. Of course. You think he's very kind and intelligent, don't you? - He's so cute. - What are you doing, Laeti? Relax, you'll scare him. Fuck, Laeti, drop that rat. Look. Did you know about this? Why didn't you tell me? If I had, you wouldn't have allowed it here. He's so cute, he kisses me all the time. I left him with my ex, but her new boyfriend doesn't like rats. I don't like rats either. - What do you give him? - Pumpkin seeds. You're stupid. I knew it. Long heart line. You act before thinking. What are you doing? He just read my hand lines. Yeah, sure. I thought we said that the rat must stay in your bedroom. Fuck. - His name is Harry. - And I didn't finish his portrait. A portrait? we are talking about a rat, Laeti. So what? You and I need to have a serious talk. What was I saying? Yes, you act and then you think. Normal people don't do that. - What do you mean? - To act or to think? Thoughts are harmful to the movements of the heart, says Paul ValÃ©ry. But action is the only way to reach thought, that's me. And everything that is reached is destroyed. Montherlant. So is it useful to think before or after action? Turn off the hoover, please. Thanks. You see? Acting before thinking is more interesting. It proves a pure heart, able to love, to embrace the world in its full humanity. The most important thing is to love and to feel loved. Thinking is harmful to the movements of the heart. I'm not a fan of philosophy. People say philosophy does not act, but I don't agree. It's alive, it's active. Yeah, sure. You're not totally wrong, I prefer to act than to think. But for now, I want to live my life, make a living, have a child and raise him. Simon. Didn't Laeti tell you? We are going to have a cat. And cats eat rats, so be careful with yours. Will you have a cat or a child? Yes. Yes. Your daughter has a problem. Why? - Her flatmate. - Simon? He's a guy. So? You know Elodie doesn't like guys. - She's jealous. - Yes. You sound like you live with her. I spend the whole day with her at the shop. So what? We know each other, obviously. Relax yourself, you're stiff like a board. Move your body. Yes. Much better. Like this. Move. Great. I'm just saying... We don't care. This... - Is for you. - What's this? - A gift. - For me? Why? What do you think? It's our third anniversary! Something to celebrate, don't you think? Three years Do you think it's been too long? Not at all, time passes very quickly. Do you remember when we first met? I remember your eyes, our first moment of intimacy, that shaking look you had on me, that kiss burning my skin. A magical, unique moment. Was it really the first time you had feelings for a woman? Yeah, I've only had straight relationships, I didn't think I could like a woman. It's like a leap into the void. You can do everything, it's like looking at your own body. And you feel the same pleasure. And your parents still don't approve it? No, but I understand them. It makes me feel uncomfortable. We have no choice. - Will you open it? - Yes, I'm just enjoying the moment. Thank you, love. They're very pretty. - Can you help me? - Of course. That's it. - Do you have a mirror? - Yes, I do. I love them, I'll always wear them. You may think that today, but one day... Yes, it's true. My sexuality is very clear. I like women, but you... I'm not so sure. I always wonder if one day you might fall in love with a guy. Shut up. You can't always question us. We're stronger than that. - I'm afraid. - Why? Because of Simon? Yes, Simon. He's a sensitive person, that's why we connected, but that's it. Why are you always attracted by appearances? Are you saying that I am superficial? I didn't say that. You would like me to never like anything, or anyone. It doesn't work like that. Simon is an artist, he's sensitive, fragile and that's why I feel we're similar. One doesn't need to be an artist to be fragile and sensitive. And why do you always flirt with him when he's around? Well, that's enough. I'm leaving. - Where are you going? - Flirting. Why did you tell Simon that we want a child? - Because it's true. - No need to tell everyone. Say you want a child with me. Of course I want a child with you. I miss your mother so much. Our love was wonderful. You were barely 13 when I met her. 40 years later, she was still beautiful, but that damn disease... Always the same. What? Wait! I'm leaving. Elodie, I wanted to show you the pictures Roity took of me. Look. - Nice. - They're cool. Thanks, Roity. You're welcome. Well, see you. Have fun. Is everything okay with your flatmate, honey? Did Magalie the gossipy tell you? There are no secrets between us. If Simon is a problem, kick him out and that's it. It's not him, but Laeti. She has changed. I feel like she's getting away from me. And I can't do anything about it. She seems possessed. I don't understand. You know what? You need to take a step back. Tonight, you come home, sleep there and tomorrow it'll be better. You're right, Roity. Take me to a nice place like when you said I was your princess. Take me to Wonderland... But you must warn Laeti. Sure. Do you remember? We came here when I was a little girl. You're not that much older. You have to teach me. Or what? I won't talk to you. First, learn how to handle the coin. I had never felt such strong sensations as I did with Laeti. Our first time was incredible. When I caressed her sex, I had no idea how to do it. It was soft, round, tender. And when she touched me... I had never felt such a caress. Because they were women's hands, but mostly because they were hers. It wasn't your first time with a woman. Of course not. I always knew I was into girls. When I was a little girl I was already in love with my teacher. I remember it. Do Laeti's parents finally accept your relationship? No, they never will. They never want to come to the flat or even invite us to their home. It's tough for them, they're bourgeois. Bourgeois... But I know you understand and love me. You are not really a lesbian, you're still searching for your true sexuality. Lesbian... This word means nothing to me. I love Elodie. I'm Elosexual. I had never been attracted to a woman before. Do you like guys? Yes I do, but not that much. If you find a good penis, you'll like it just as much. That's what annoys me with men. The totemic connection they have with their penis. Always. Women don't make love with a totem, but with feelings. I have feelings for you. You know it's impossible. It seems so natural to me, why can't you see what's obvious? Think about it, you'll realise something. Leave me alone, Simon. Okay. I want to do something. Go ahead, enjoy. Relax, I just want to draw your portrait. I'm going to get my things. Don't worry, she is honest. I tried very hard to accept her need to be playful. But if it gets the best of her... Listen, don't be angry. You mustn't trust your certainties but rather your convictions, because convictions are very valid on a human level, but not certainties. They lock you in and prevent you from discovering others. You're right, Roity. The first time she went to the shop, it was love at first sight. The first time. If you want to be sure about her intentions, ask her to marry you. Do you think marriage would change our situation? No. Just that of your child. Don't start again. - Oh yes I do! - No! Take off your shirt. I've had orgasms as strong with men as with women. But with women it's more erotic, the mirror effect. You discover more. With men it's kind of a power relation. Do you have threesomes with a man sometimes? I knew you would ask that, all men's fantasy. You would like to have sex with us, don't you? But you're deluded. You don't understand. We love each other, it's not just sex. I don't like your girlfriend. But with you and another girl, maybe. Don't talk to me like that. I'll tell Elo everything. You won't say anything. Do you want to bet? Yeah, get undressed. What if Elodie comes home and sees us like this? Don't worry, she's gone for the weekend. Otherwise I wouldn't let you do this. Come on, draw me. By the way, I'm bisexual. Did you know that in every man there is a woman sleeping? No. A beast sleeping. Let's do a test. I'll kiss you. - Sure. - No, listen. I'll kiss you. If the pleasure stays, it means that magic happens and you like men more. But if pleasure disappears quickly, it means you're really a lesbian. No. Slow down. Before we go further, I'll teach you how to touch a woman. Arousing. I can't pose anymore. No, stay still, as if you were a marble statue. Desire doesn't disappear. It's confirmed. Stop. Stop. It's not conclusive, we said a test. Swear you won't tell Elo. I swear. But we must finish the test. If we do it, then you'll leave me alone. It's just a test. OK. Stop, stop. We played too much. - Get dressed. - I want more. You're crazy. - Want to walk me home? - What? I thought we decided to spend the weekend together, and tomorrow I had planned a little walk by the sea! I miss her too much. If you miss her too much, I will take you home on one condition, one last glass of wine. Okay, but I shouldn't accept your blackmail. Fucking asshole. Elo, what are you doing here? You forgot this in the living room. Wake up. Get out! Get out of here! And you too! I never want to see you again! - I told you no alcohol. - It's my fault, of course. I thought you locked the door. Fuck. I thought the door was locked. Really? You think I'm stupid. Open the door, Elo. Now I know, I know I love you. We were drunk, I promise you it won't happen again. I didn't even feel pleasure. I was thinking about you, I couldn't let go. Shut up! Shut up! Open the door, please. - We were both very drunk. - That's your excuse? You don't understand. I don't care about him, it was a mistake. I realise that now. He does all he can to make our lives miserable, can't you see? Open your eyes, Laeti. He's manipulative and homophobic! He's just a man. I was stupid, I made a mistake. You keep defending him! He damaged you, he damaged us, he damaged our privacy. Fucking asshole! I'm stupid too! I don't know what happened. I lost control because of alcohol. Stop! You suck! Did your magician drink alcohol? I thought he never drank alcohol. - He made an exception. - As you did. No. What do you mean? You have slept with a man. That's an exception, isn't it? Do I make exceptions? No. I can never touch you again. Do you understand? Never again. Don't say that. Get out! Go with him if you want! I never want to see you again! Never again! - Laetitia - What? There is an extra person here. Tell that asshole to go away. Of course. Can I take a shower? When will you be done with the bathroom? Laetitia didn't come last night. But you know that, we're just fixing it fast. We'll get cleaned up and we'll let you know, okay? We won't take too long. What a party! Are you okay? Simon, you obviously can't go on living here. Perfect, I was going to leave soon. Great. When are you leaving? Soon, I just When are you leaving, Simon? - Well - Tonight. Pack your things and leave tonight. Well, I'm leaving to the country, so tomorrow morning. No, you're leaving tonight! Is that clear? Leave us alone. No, tomorrow morning. Pack your things and don't forget your rat. Shut up! Are you jealous? She loves me! Why do you look so grim? I'm not grim, my stomach hurts. Has ou relationship changed? Look, Laetitia, it's hard for me to forget. I need time. I feel like throwing up. I say I need time and you want to throw up? It's not that. I've been nauseous for days. I didn't have my period this month. When do you usually have your period? You know it's always around the 2nd or the 3rd. What day is it today? The 28th. Don't worry, I understand. We wanted a child. Maybe he's already here. But the father is not anonymous. He's not the father, but the donor. Honestly, I don't know what to say. You're right, we shouldn't keep the baby. It's an unwanted child. Wait. However, we wanted a child. Maybe it's the solution. Do you think it's a solution? Actually, maybe you're right. Who cares about Simon? He's just a donor, we wanted this child so much. Do you still love me? I still love you. Say it again. I still love you and I'll always do. Are you still in the clothing business, Roity? I see you still have a great sense of humour, Inspector. No, I'm done now, I'm retired. - You know the inspector. - Sure. Hello, Elodie. - I have to go now, see you. - Bye. You look amazing today. Thank you. Well, are you ready? Of course. Laetitia is pregnant. What? Laetitia? We decided to raise the child together. Who is the father? We don't care about the father. You're right, the child is more important. So, am I a grandfather? - Yes. It's what you wanted. - It's my dream. Well, let's celebrate! - So I am... - A grandfather. What's going on? I have to ask you one thing. If it's a girl, promise me she'll be named after your mother. I swear. I remind you that we use charcoal, it's volatile, so be careful on how you place or dispose your hand on your canvas, it'll avoid having it all over the place or messing up your sketch. You can blur a little bit there, that works. Laetitia, what are you doing? Look at your model. You don't pay attention. Hi. Call me, we must talk. Simon. Sit down, please. Do you live here now? Yes, it's temporary. - A cup of coffee? - No, thanks. - Did you worry about coming alone? - No, why? - Does Elodie know it? - Yes, she does. I'm sure she disagrees. Why am I here, Simon? I know you're pregnant. Will you keep the baby? Yes, I'll keep it. I also want to keep it. Elodie and I will decide, not you. But I'm the father and I'll recognise that child, he'll have my name, we'll both raise him. And after all, it's all your fault. Now, listen. You'll consider Elodie as a parenthesis, a moment of confusion in your life, okay? My only moment of confusion was when you manipulated me. Yes, we'll pick up your things together, you'll live with me. - Stop, Simon. - We'll be all right. Shut up! I shouldn't have come. Leave me alone. Don't forget I'm the father of our child. You drive me crazy. Hi Elodie, it's Simon. Are you home tonight? I'll give you the keys after work. Hello? Sit down. Okay. Since you don't drink alcohol, I made you an exotic fruit cocktail. So thoughtful of you. Where is Laeti? At school, studying for her exams. Cheers. Do you have the keys? To settle the account. Thank you, I won't recount it. There shouldn't be any problem. And I don't want us to get angry. We'll frequently see each other. Why? I'm the father of the child. No way. Yes, of course. I'll go alone, I know the way. Why are you here? Elodie had another crisis. She's in the hospital, Simon came to see her. I don't know what happened. I'm going see her. Meet me there, okay? Go! I'll be there soon. Rest. - Is she sleeping? - She just fell asleep. Did Elodie tell you I'm pregnant? Yes, I'm the happiest man on Earth. But she didn't tell you who the father is. I don't care. You don't want to know? No, I'll take a guess. Hello, Simon. - What are you doing here? - I want you to leave the girls alone. Fuck. What do you mean? I'm telling you this very nicely. Forget about the girls, you'll never see them again. Simon! I don't want to see you with them anymore! A month later Great, do it again. Nice. Yes, wonderful. Now from the side. Like this. Now only Elo looking at me. Perfect. - One second. - We were doing great. Hi, Simon. Laetitia, something strong happened between us. I think about it all the time. Don't tell me you didn't like it. Simon, you have to stop, you have to leave me alone. I was drunk, I didn't know what I was saying or doing. Laetitia, tell me the truth! I beg you, I can't handle it anymore. Please leave me alone and forget about all of this. I feel like my head is going to explode. Look, I think I should call my friend, inspector Kerneguez. Tell me what happened! What kind of question is that? I told you I didn't want a flatmate. Look where it got us! It's clearly harassment. It's up to the police to deal with this. I'm not sure. Do you still see him? Girls, deal with it. It's not my problem. Your coffee. What's going on, Elo? I'm here, calm down. I can't take it anymore. Can you explain me what this is? Elodie, forget about it! Laeti told me that she prefers a normal family to raise our child. I don't know what to say. Elodie! What are you doing here, Simon? Come with me now. You're crazy if you think I'll go away and leave Elo just like that... - You hurt me. - Cut the bullshit and take your responsibilities. Do you understand? Fuck. Is the cleaning lady sick? Yeah, she's sick. Well, I'll cook for you. Roity. Don't be mad at me, but tonight I prefer to stay alone. But I'll see you tomorrow. Thank you for listening to me and thank you for what you and your cop friend are doing for me. But you're wasting your time. Don't worry, honey, we'll get him. You can go home, but you have to promise me that you'll rest well. I promise, I'll go straight to bed. I'm not leaving you for a man but for a child. You remain my most beautiful love story. Forgive me, it's getting too hard for me. Three months later... I'll move with Elodie again. What? I don't love you anymore, Simon. I can't live with you. Can't you see there's no love between us? What are you saying? I really tried. I thought a child could be the solution I thought it could make me love you. But it doesn't work that way. And And? Keep talking. Wait. What's this? I love Elodie, that's all. You and I can't help it. Fuck. Stop, Simon. Stop. - Shut up! - Stop! Shut the fuck up! - You're crazy. - Shut up. - Let me go! - Shut up! You don't love anyone. You play with me like you played with her. - Stop! - You drive me insane! You're fucking crazy! You make me sick. Stop. - Hi, Roity. - Hi, Magalie. - Elo, we must talk. - What? - We must talk now. - Why? - Come with me. - Is it urgent? - Yes. - Okay. - Magalie, can you take care of the shop for a moment? - Okay. Thanks. I went to the police station yesterday to give them Simon's address, but he was already there, in custody. And Laetitia? They took her to the hospital. That asshole beat her. And She had a miscarriage. I have to see her! You can't, we have to wait a few days. They won't let you in, visits are forbidden. Sit down. - Hello. - Hello. Hello, are you the person who called me? Yes, about Laetitia, how is she? Look, physically she's going to be fine, but since we took her in, she has stubbornly refused to talk. It can happen for such traumatic cases. - I'll take you to her. - Thank you. I'm concerned, do you think she'll ever talk again? As of now I cannot be sure, but you should see her. It's right there. Then you can come to my office if you want. Thank you. I knew you'd come. BETWEEN US
