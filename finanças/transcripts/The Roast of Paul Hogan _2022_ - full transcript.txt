ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Roast of Paul Hogan. Please put your hands together for: (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) And Tom Gleeson. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) And please welcome to the stage your Roast Master Shane Jacobson. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) Oh, yeah. Wow. Oh, yeah. G'day folks and welcome to all of you at home and everyone here at The Palms at Crown in beautiful Melbourne town. I have the dubious and contractual obligation of being your Roast Master for this evening. Comedy roasts don't often happen in Australia but taking the piss is a national pastime. It's how most Australians communicate on a daily basis. But tonight we plan to turn up the wick a little on Australian comedy royalty. Before we go any further, let's remind ourselves of some of the work of the great man we all know as Hoges. (WHISTLES) (LAUGHTER) Thus. And suddenly, without warning... (CAR ENGINE REVS) Cleary, middleweight champion of North Queensland. And breaker of women's hearts everywhere. (LAUGHTER) Struth, must be worse than I thought. Fosters. Paul. G'day love. I'll slip an extra shrimp on the barbie for you. One for me, one for me mate. That's a knife. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome our Man of The Hour, Paul Hogan. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) (THEME MUSIC PLAYS) OK, so before we kick off, we should point out that yes, Tom Gleeson here is in a Haz-Chem suit. That is because this morning he came down with some symptoms and we obviously don't want him here on the stage with us. (LAUGHTER) The truth is, with or without symptoms, we just didn't want Tom on stage with us. So this is quite honestly the truth, we've set up a remote studio where he can keep his illness and himself away from us. So Tom, feel free to exit stage right, camera left, well right now. You're off. Ladies and gentlemen, say goodbye to Tom Gleeson. Some people say Paul Hogan can't act, I'm sorry I've misread that, everyone says Paul Hogan can't act. But Paul Hogan has made an awful lot of film and television, and if we're honest, he's also made a lot of awful film and television as well. But I can assure you that Hoges is just like the guy next door, that is, if the guy next door to you has more money than God, lives in a mansion and has three live-in maids. Or, as Charlie Sheen likes to call him, 'my inspiration'. (LAUGHTER) Now just so you know, both here and at home, folks, everything that is said here tonight is just for laughs. Nothing that gets said here is said with any malice of any kind, except for some of the stuff said about Tom, Steve, and JPY. Alright, the next roaster was once described by Steve Vizard as the funniest, cleverest and most charismatic comedian to hit our screens in decades. Ladies and gentlemen, Steve Vizard. (APPLAUSE) No, no. No, please hold your applause. (CLEARS THROAT) Your Royal highness-es, Prime Minister, other representatives of Hillsong. (LAUGHTER) Mr Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, it is indeed a unique pleasure to be up here tonight, because, well principally because they're paying me in cash, but mainly because I thought Paul Hogan had died 13 years ago. (LAUGHTER) I've been asked to speak about this man we call Paul Hogan because that is his name, for seven minutes. And I said to myself, "Seven minutes, really? "To pay homage to a man such as this." I would have thought two minutes, maybe, at a stretch, three tops. But I really would really like to begin by paying tribute to a comedy statesman who for over 50 years, 50 years, has shaped our nation. I would really like to begin that way, but sadly we're here to talk about this man. (LAUGHTER) Paul Desmond Tutu, Dorothy Hogan. I'm gonna be frank, I barely know the guy, and what I do know about him is, frankly, a little iffy. I mean, have a look at him. It's his first night out from the home up this late, since he got the bag. This incidentally will be the only Roast in history where there's a half-time break to give the Roastee his meds and empty him. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) In fact, the only reason that Paul turned up tonight, and I kid you not, he heard the word 'roast' and he thinks he's getting gravy and crackling. I say, you're getting the gravy and crackling. I know, I know. It's difficult, I know, for all of us to look at this, well, you know wizened shell of a creature, and remember he was a giant. He was a giant. Is it just me or is he literally shrinking? Literally, before our very eyes, he's turning into an action figurine of himself. I almost want to go and pick him up and put him on a shelf. Although frankly I think his last movie managed to achieve that. Hoges was big. He was really big. And for those that weren't around in the '70s, imagine if... Imagine if Mick Fanning and Caitlyn Jenner had a lovechild, and then dumped it in a tanning studio. That's how big he was. I was a teenager and I was growing up in small town called Warrandyte, and each night I'd sit alone in my bedroom. I would, and when I'd finished doing what I had to do, I'd head upstairs to the big room. And there was always a fire blazing, sometimes it was in a fireplace. And beside it, there was an old-fashioned TV. And each night from that telly's glow would emerge almost magically, a face. And it was a face of a friend. It was a face that made my life bearable. Mike Willesee, his name was. And after that show, 'The Paul Hogan Show'. 60, 60? 60 episodes there were of 'The Paul Hogan Show', or more accurately, one episode 60 times. And even as a teenager, I was mesmerised by this man and his story. An ordinary man, ordinary education Marist Brothers Parramatta. In fact, he was the most famous thing to come out of Marist Brothers Parramatta. Putting aside the seven witnesses to a Royal Commission... (LAUGHTER) ..and the defrocking of Brother Gregory, but that's... He was, but an ordinary man who had started out as a bridge painter. We all knew it, and yet he was this ordinary man, this painter of bridges, now miraculously on TV, and he was in my living room. And to a lonely Warrandyte boy, a teenager, albeit one blessed with great talent and rakish good looks, Paul's story, it just resonated with possibility. If he can do it, maybe, well just maybe, and so inspired, I did, I ventured out, nervously, tentatively, and I too started painting bridges. (LAUGHTER) You holding up OK? We'll have the crackling soon. Paul's voice resonated the voice of ordinary Australians. He looked like us, he talked like us, his chauffeur parked his Ferrari in his underground carpark just like us. And of course, Paul's great talent for laughter. Laugh and the whole world laughs with you. Cry, and you've seen the box office returns for 'Strange Bedfellows'. Nearly there. Nearly there. He thinks we're on a plane. I hope you don't mind me sharing this story, Paul, but many years ago, Paul told me, and I think it says a lot about the man, in his early days on the bridge, come morning tea time, Paul would make his way up to the very top of the bridge. Which for me, in so many ways, is the symbolic heart of our nation. And from the very highest span, Paul would look around and down at the little human figures below. And then, and this is the part that always stuck with me, and then he would urinate on them. (LAUGHTER) You see, Paul thought that was funny. That is the sort of person you've chosen to celebrate tonight. Shame on you. We'll be landing soon, mate. Just keep the belt on. Paul Hogan will forever be remembered as an ordinary man who for 50 years, took a scalpel to Australian society, and then, to his forehead and eyelids. How fittingly perfect, I think, that this man who started out his career on 'New Faces', should end his career with a new face. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) If I can be sincere for just a moment, Paul, you can turn the thing back up now. Paul, you are a true national treasure. You are a trailblazer in an age of social media where everyone fights to be extraordinary, you remind us of the beauty and the power of being ordinary. In an age where every blogger and his dog strives to be different, you remind us of the power of being ourselves. In an age of conflict, you remind us of the immense strength of simple laughter. Sometimes laughing at other people, but you showed us the best laughter is laughing at the follies of ourselves. It's been an honour to share this stage with you, Paul Hogan. Thank you. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) Isn't it a wonderful invention, Gladwrap? I mean, in the old days, you made, say a salmon sandwich, you had a bit of salmon left over, you'd have to chuck it out. But now you put it in a dish, wrap it in Gladwrap, stick it in the fridge for two weeks and then chuck it out. (LAUGHTER) Our next roaster Ernie Dingo is a great mate of Hoges. I rang Ernie last week and said, "We're going to roast Paul Hogan." He said, "Mate, you're a bit late to the party. "He already looks like he spent three weeks in a brickies kiln." Ladies and gentlemen, the one and the only, Ernie Dingo. (APPLAUSE) Oh. Hang on a sec, mate, I got something here. Just hold this for me, will you. Just hold that. OK, mate. (LAUGHTER) Oh, mate. (APPLAUSE) Give it up, ladies and gentlemen, for our host, Mr Shane Jacobson. Thanks, mate. To get ready for tonight's show, Shane went to one of those fat farms. Apparently he got there just in time for harvest. No, I'm just kidding. I don't care what these people have said, told me backstage, I don't think you're fat at all. I think you're hot. Oh. Yeah, hot, 'cause heat expands. If you're all wondering what I am doing here tonight, ladies and gentlemen, I'm here because I'm your token Blackfella. Kerri-Anne. Oh, I love this woman. Kerri-Anne has been a loud advocate for being able to voice her opinion. Now, it's funny with a face full of Botox that she wants to talk about freedom of expression. I've got to be careful here tonight, I don't want to be up for elder bashing. No, actually backstage, Kerri-Anne and I, she came up to me and she was having a good yarn and was talking to me all about land rights and Indigenous health issues and Aboriginal constitutional recognition and how being excluded from the Constitution makes me less of an Australian, so she was going to fix all this stuff then and I... Yeah, I'm only joking. Kerri-Anne doesn't talk to Blackfellas. Anyway, no, sorry mate, yeah. The hilarious Mr Shaun Micallef. Yeah, mate. It's good to see you do that without a zimmer frame, mate. I know being up front early, they're going to get me after, but never mind, it's on. Oh, David Letterman. Mr Vizard. Alex Lee is here. They tell me that you're a comedian. They told me that there was going to be a lot of people on the panel who were all comedians. I still can't understand why white people tell black people lies. Troy Kinne, apparently he's a comedian. Mate, I've seen your shows. There're about as funny as a burning hospital. Christie Whelan-Browne. Nervous now, aren't you, mate? Hey? No, it makes me proud to live in a society where a tall statuesque blonde woman can finally get a break. Talking about... (LAUGHS) Talking about finally getting a break, Pauline Hanson decided not to come tonight because she knew that Kerri-Anne would take her dignity. Tom Gleeson would take her wig, and I was going to take her out. It's very special to have Paul's granddaughter, Mylee, here tonight. Mylee is too young to remember 'Almost an Angel' which make her one of the luckiest people in the room. I had the honour of working with this young fellow here on 'Dundee II', and I can honestly say that no matter what race, creed, colour or age you were, Hoges treated everybody exactly the same... ..as a lowly paid servant. We had some success though, didn't he? He knew all about finances and when he got his tax bill, he rang up the ATO and says, "How much for cash?" No, Hoges knew he was in trouble when the tax office had sent him two letters, 'F' and 'U'. Now being a mate of Hoges, I went to his place in LA, flown all the way over there, I go around to his place, I knock on the door, standing there opened the door and he looked at me and he goes, "The Service Entrance is around the side." Mate, in all seriousness, mate, I looked up the word 'larrikin' in the dictionary and it should have read, "A boisterous often badly behaved young man. "A person who acts with apparently careless disregard "for social or political conventions. "A person who is unsophisticated but likeable, "good-hearted and a rough diamond." Well, that's what it should have said. But that shit wasn't there. All there was, mate, was a photo of you. Love ya, Hoges. Time to move on to our next Roaster. What can I tell you about Christie Whelan-Browne? She 39, she's a brilliant dramatic and comedic performer, she can sing, she can dance, the camera loves her. Her performances are always amazing, whether she's doing TV sketch comedy on 'Mad as Hell' or musical theatre or even Shakespeare at the MTC. What a loser. Ladies and gentlemen, the under-achieving, undesirable, unbelievable Christie Whelan Brown! (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) Wow. I was really surprised when Shane rang and invited me to be here tonight. He normally only calls because 'Christie' and 'Krispy Kreme' are so close in his phone. And his chubby little fingers slip. It's so cute. But my young son is at home watching this on TV and I'm glad you are watching, Duke, because I want you to see this is what happens if you don't eat your vegetables. We've got John Paul Young here tonight. (APPLAUSE) Just a small pause while everyone under 75 Googles John Paul Young. (LAUGHTER) And there's Steve Vizard. I love Steve. (APPLAUSE) But geez, Steve, I've seen less bloated bodies being dragged out of rivers. Another comedy legend, Shaun Micallef. Jesus, how many old white guys did they get to be up here tonight? I'm not gonna say anything bad about Shaun. I just won't. Some people might get up here and talk about how vain he is, how he spends hours and hours perfecting that grey helmet head of hair and staring at himself in the mirror. Or the fact he was an aspiring teen model. Not many people know that. Or the fact that he has no soul. But... I'm not going to do that. Mainly because he is my boss and he could fire me. So I will not be saying anything about his big googly eyes. I just won't do it. That's it. I love you, Shaun. And Tom Gleeson is here. One of the funniest comedians in the entire world. Just ask him. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) And Troy Kinne's here. Where are you, Troy? You chubby little bitch. There you are. Who is Troy Kinne, I can hear you screaming at the TV? Apparently, he has a TV show. That's all he ever talks about. No one's ever seen it, of course, and no-one knows who he is. I mean, I don't even know who he is and I was on his show. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) But we are here tonight to celebrate Paul Hogan. (AUDIENCE CHEERING) Still with us buddy? Yeah. Here he is. Barely. I thought we lost him there for a sec. People do not realise what Paul has done for women in comedy. And I would just personally like to thank him for that, on behalf of all us spunky sheilas and good sorts. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) (AUDIENCE CLAPPING) Paul single-handedly changed the way we looked at women. Well, ogled is probably a more accurate word. He created a lot of opportunities for a very diverse group of actresses of Anglo-Saxon background, with blonde hair, and big boobies. No, seriously, Paul wrote all sorts of challenging characters for women. Woman in a bikini watering a lawn. Woman in a bikini jogging on a beach. Woman in bikini cooking dinner. And then as he grew in confidence as a writer, we saw his approach to writing for women, grow and evolve. Two women in bikinis watering a lawn. Two women in bikinis jogging on a beach. And then came 'Crocodile Dundee.' A movie where the most famous gag is two men standing on the street comparing the sizes of their 'knives.' OK, Paul, we get it! And congratulations. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) In the entertainment industry, there is an ongoing fight to get more Australian content on our screens, more uniquely Australian stories told in uniquely Australian voices. There are campaigns to make it happen, quotas to make it happen. But Paul Hogan has been telling uniquely Australian stories, in uniquely Australian voices, for over 50 years. And with all his international success, Paul Hogan actually made it cool, on the world stage, to be Australian. Thank you, Paul. (WHISTLING) And honestly, what an honour to be up here with all these legends and thank you so much. Have a great night. (AUDIENCE CHEERING) Thank you, Christie. I first met Christie Whelan Browne at a gym, if you remember. She was doing bench press, I think, at the time. And she was like, "Six, seven." Then she started struggling. She's like, "Can you help me out here?" And I went, "Eight." (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) We'll be back right after the break. Good day, Paul, Russel Coight, here. Sorry I couldn't be there for the big night, I... ..well, I wasn't invited but that's OK. Listen, from one outback legend to another, you are number one. Actually, I'm number one, you are probably number two or three. But anyway, still very impressive. Listen, mate, have a fantastic night and I hope to catch up with you really, really soon. Good on you, Paul. OK, yeah, listen, I've done it. Do they invoice us or do we invoice them, because I've found that... ..shit, I've left the camera running. How do I turn this off? Oh, no. John Paul Young is our next presenter and his greatest hit was 'Yesterday's Hero.' Oh, the irony. But seriously, this is a true story, tell me if I'm wrong here, JPY. He was so famous, they used an armoured van for his first gig at the Myer Music Bowl. Sadly though, he got out of that van and performed anyway. So, ladies and gentlemen, a man who's hip now goes out more than he does. John Paul Young! (AUDIENCE CHEERING) (UPBEAT MUSIC) Thank you, Shane, for that well-meaning but poorly written introduction. Oh, hang on, one second mate, I gotta do you one favour. I am sorry. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Sorry, mate, as you were. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING AND CLAPPING) Yeah. Shane recently took a physical for some life insurance. All they'd cover him for was fire and theft. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) But he's got a good heart. He tried to share a sandwich with a homeless woman today but she told him to bugger off and get his own. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) And we have Troy Kinne, here! Troy's actually a well-known party animal. Last night, he went to the club just out the back here and he was rocking it on the dance floor. They played the twist and he did that twist. They played the jump and he jumped. They played 'Come on Eileen' and he's not going back there tomorrow. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Out the back, Ernie Dingo just bet me $11,820, that I couldn't guess how much he owes his bookie. And Tom Gleeson's here. Some don't know this, but Tom comes from Gunnedah. He grew up just a stone's throw away from where the whole family died of mysterious head injuries. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) And have you seen Tom's show 'Hard Quiz?' Why would anyone go on an ABC quiz show? I love Aunty but you answer tough questions and win what, like, 200 bucks. On another network you can win $1 million for telling us how many people were in the Jackson 5. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Now, look, anyone who knows me, knows that I'm a history buff but I was interested to learn that Captain Cook actually came ashore South of Botany Bay before sailing up to his famous landing point in 1770, according to eye witness, Kerri-Anne Kennerley. Ouch. Oh! Another little-known fact, Kerri-Anne has cured eight Peeping Toms, so that's pretty interesting. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) The great Steve Vizard. Steve used to be a lawyer. But not a great one. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) He lost more cases than Jetstar. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) And Alex Lee is here. She's half Chinese. From what I can see, it's the top half. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Isn't this a great evening, ladies and gentlemen? If only Paul could've been alive to see. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Let me finish by saying, Paul was the first chief Barker or presidente of the Variety Club that has raised millions of dollars for sick children all over Australia. And even to this day, Paul is inspiring children. Only last week, one little eight-year-old boy walked for the first time when he got up out of his wheelchair, stumbled to the TV and turned off 'Almost an Angel.' (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) But seriously, Hoges, you and the old Stropper were very kind to me and my band back in the '70s and the early '80s and I thank you so very, very much. (AUDIENCE CLAPPING) (AUDIENCE CHEERING) Now, we have some of our finest Australians here tonight. Obviously, none of them are up here on stage. Up here it's all Botox, booze and pills, and I'm just talking about Kerri-Anne. Ladies and gentlemen, Kerri-Anne Kennerley, folks! (UPBEAT MUSIC) (AUDIENCE CLAPPING) Oh, it is so lovely to be here tonight. It really is a treat. And Shane, you know I love you. He has done so much television, he's in films, he's in musicals. As far as I can tell the only thing he hasn't been in is a gym. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Alex Lee, there you are. Alex, great television career on the ABC and SBS. So, it must be really weird tonight to have viewers. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) And how cool is it to have the rock legend himself, John Paul Young. (AUDIENCE CHEERING) Here we go. You know, there's a new scientific study that has shown that one shot of alcohol takes nine minutes off your life. So, according to my calculations, John Paul Young died sometime in October 1874. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) And Ernie Dingo. Ernie's so cool. And I tell you, any man whose career survived 'Dundee II' is pretty incredible in my book. And now, we get to Paul, I mean, it is generally so hard roasting Paul. He is a legend. I have actually had the privilege of knowing Paul for over 35 years. And it's very interesting when people meet Paul for the first time, they always say, basically the same two things, "He's shorter than I expected" and "What's with the fishnet stockings?" Hmm. You know, 'The Paul Hogan Show' was one of the very first shows on Australian television to be broadcast in living colour. But to say Paul hasn't kept up with technology is a bit of an understatement. I mean, this is the guy who thought Instagram was a fast drug deal. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) And he thinks an iPad is a feminine hygiene product. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) But Hoges has acted in almost a dozen films, but calling Hoges an actor is a bit like calling a prawn a shrimp. I mean, you are not really wrong but you're not right either. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Hey, do you remember in the famous 'Mind Over Matter' scene in the 'Croc' film? You know, when Dundee is staring at the aggressive water buffalo and doing a... and it falls asleep. Well, Hoges used that same technique on the entire audience of 'Lightning Jack.' (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) In 1986, Paul Hogan was appointed a member of the Order of Australia for services to tourism and entertainment. As you might have read as well, Paul fought the Australian Tax Office for seven years. (AUDIENCE CHEERING) They made dozens of claims, the papers were full of headlines, and yet Paul was never, ever charged. The crime commission investigation just dismissed. His revenge? The most recent film, 'The Very Excellent Mr Dundee.' Now, Paul figured, if he'd gone through seven years of tax hell, well, we had to go through an entire 90 minutes of him just sleepwalking his way through that disaster. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) And if you haven't seen 'The Very Excellent Mr Dundee,' do yourself a favour. Don't. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Now, Paul, the great Danish humourist, Victor Borge, once said, "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." And over the years, your television shows, your movies, you know, they've made millions and millions of dollars. You've collected so many wonderful awards. But that's not a legacy. For half a century, your films, your television shows, have brought millions of people together. That's a legacy. (AUDIENCE CLAPPING AND CHEERING) (UPBEAT MUSIC) (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) These mongrel bitches like these for years. And let me tell you, they know what they like when it comes to food. And they love their Pal. And no wonder. Look what goes into every can. Delicious, tender, young, prime, lean, mouth-watering beef. (DOG BARKING) Deliciously sauteed in marrowbone jelly. Full of goodness. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Nutritious. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Perfectly balanced. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Too good for you mongrels! (UPBEAT MUSIC) Hi. Rob Sitch. You know, when a talented Aussie goes overseas like you did all those years ago and succeeds so wildly like you did, it makes all of us proud. And we really admire you, Kylie, and congratulations to... ..what's that? It's not K... ..who is it? Oh, Paul Hogan. I didn't know he'd died. I didn't... ..then what is this? A roast? About time! Look, there's no greater admirer of Paul Hogan than me. Until 'Flipper.' Give me my money back! (UPBEAT MUSIC) OK, folks, we are going to change gears here just for a moment, if that's OK. Tonight wouldn't be complete without honouring the man who stood shoulder to shoulder with Hoges, not just on camera, but in business and in life. And of course, I'm talking about Paul's best mate, the late great John Cornell AKA the loveable Strop. (LAUGHTER) HOGES: The old gag, right? You stir it up, you tip it down the sink and you won't have a blocked drain for six months. (LAUGHTER) No, mate, no, you drink it. (AUDIENCE GASPS) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (LAUGHTER) Oh, I feel really good. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) What an amazing giant of entertainment John Cornell was. Even the likes of Kerri Packer sought John's advice and opinions, and John got to get some of his advice from his loving wife the wonderful Delvene Delaney, who we know is watching. Love you, mate. (APPLAUSE) I would like to say that we have come under quite a lot of criticism tonight that... Well, from a few people that are saying that the only reason we have Alex Lee here is for diversity. And it's simply not true. She's also incredibly cheap, ladies and gentlemen. (LAUGHTER) Put your hands together for the hilarious and very affordable Alex Lee, ladies and gentlemen! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) Hi. My name's Alex Lee and don't worry, I haven't heard of me either. (LAUGHTER) Look at this! I can't believe it! Here I am, with some of the legends of the Kerri-Anne, John Paul Young, Paul Hogan. It's like I'm at the 'In Memoriam' segment at next year's Logies. (LAUGHTER) What an honour. But seriously, so many of my lifelong heroes are up here. Shaun Micallef, oh, my god! From 'The Micallef' programme, to 'Micallef Tonight' and 'Shaun Micallef's Mad As Hell', no one has done more than Shaun for promoting young up-and-coming Shaun Micallefs on Australian TV. (LAUGHTER) Thank you, Shaun. I love Ernie Dingo. You're one of my favourite actors in this country. I also love that by having one Aboriginal man and a half-Asian woman on the same show, Channel 7 has filled its diversity quota for the year. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) It's what I like to call the Cadbury approach to diversity there's a glass and a half in every one. (LAUGHTER) Speaking of diversity, Troy Kinne is here tonight. (LAUGHTER) Troy, I have never seen anyone look more uncomfortable in a suit. You look like an NRL player awaiting sentencing for a nightclub assault charge. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) Troy, you look like the profile picture of every bloke online who tells me I'm not funny and should go back to where I came from. (LAUGHTER) Kerri-Anne Kennerley is here. You always look amazing. I'm sorry you got sacked from 'Studio 10' but on the bright side, it could be worse you could be on 'Studio 10'. (LAUGHTER) Now, Paul, you started your career on the Harbour Bridge as a rigger. Did you give Tom Gleeson some tips on rigging just before he won the Gold Logie? Hey! No. Come on! It's a crooked system we all know it. I rigged it fair and square. (LAUGHTER) Hoges' first regular TV gig was on 'A Current Affair' when he still worked on the bridge. Yeah, he was their first ever shonky construction worker. (LAUGHTER) Now, early on in your career, Paul, you told everyone you were from Lightning Ridge, instead of Sydney, to make yourself seem more Aussie. And that's what I admire about you. You never let the truth get in the way of a good story. Now that worked for you, and it works for your granddaughter Mylee Hogan, as a journalist for Channel 7. (LAUGHTER) Now Christie came up tonight and talked about how your show objectified women but, you know what? I think you gave us ladies plenty to objectify too. I see those outfits you had on, the unbuttoned shirt, ripped sleeves showing off those tanned, muscly arms. Those teeny tiny denim shorts. Honestly Hoges, if I was 50 years older, I'd climb you like the Sydney Harbour Bridge. (LAUGHTER) I'm sorry, I am flirting. It's just crazy to think that I could be the next ex Mrs Hogan. (LAUGHTER) I'll never forget the first time I ever saw 'Crocodile Dundee'. It feels like it was yesterday! In fact it was three days ago when I found out that I was doing this show. But I loved it! I mean, that scene with Linda Kozlowski in that incredible black swimming costume alone in the bush being stalked and preyed upon by an ancient reptile. And then this bloody huge crocodile shows up! (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) That film put Australia on the map. Before 'Croc Dundee' everyone thought Australia was a distant backwater full of bogans and yobbos. But now, thanks to you, Paul, everyone knows that it is. (LAUGHTER) And your tourism ads for the American market were iconic. There you were, on the top of the Harbour Bridge, dressed as Lady Liberty we're all just lucky Mick Dundee wasn't there. He would've grabbed your nuts and thrown you off of the top. (LAUGHTER) Mr Hogan, everybody in this country knows you. You've been famous for 50 years, but you still have that down-to-earth appeal. My Uber driver on the way here tonight said, "You're the kind of guy you'd meet at a pub, and have a laugh with." And from meeting you tonight, I'd say that's absolutely true. He also said Tom Gleeson is a bald, ranga prick. (LAUGHTER) That's not important. That's not important. What is important is this connection that Paul Hogan has with this country. He single-handedly invented the Australian persona. Laid back, funny, charming, a larrikin. Today, they're such stereotypes of what it means to be Australian, but here's what's incredible its all just Hoges. Just an ordinary Aussie bloke being authentically him since day one. An ordinary bloke who's made generations laugh and be proud of where they come from. And there's nothing ordinary about that at all. Thanks, Hoges. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) G'day Hoges. In all the 47 years that I've known you, there's only one thing that really annoyed me. Your early eating habits. Corny told me about the time you and he were in Italy, in the '70s, squeaking away down the Via Veneto in your new leather jackets looking for somewhere to eat. And Corny was after the authentic Italian experience. But you just wanted your dinner preferably a hamburger and a thick shake 'cause it was 5:00, so finally Corny found a tiny traditional trattoria, packed with locals, and the signora said you could have a table in five minutes by the window. So you went off to the loo, and these two old gentlemen shuffed around the corner, probably in their 90s, and into the restaurant. So the signora came back and asked John if he wouldn't mind giving up your table to these two very old, loyal customers because they were weak from their walk and very hungry. And of course, Corny agreed. You came back from the loo, spotted them and said, "Oi! Those two old geezers have got our table, mate!" And Corny nodded and said, "Yep, I gave it to them." And you said, "What'd you do that for? "They don't watch 'The Paul Hogan Show' in Italy, mate!" So, you went to the table, the worst one in the room, at least for Corny, 'cause he's facing the kitchen, and the swinging doors are in his face and you were lording it up, facing the whole restaurant. Suddenly the signora taps a glass and says to the whole room, in broken English "Please stand and applaud these two honourable gentlemen "for giving up their seats to these two very old men. "It never happens these days and we should salute them." So a bottle of wine arrives and the whole restaurant erupts in applause. And you have to stand up and very sheepishly acknowledge the applause and take a bow before you sat back down again. And all Corny could say was, "You two-faced bastard". (LAUGHTER) So even though you still get hangry, Hoges, I still love you. Thanks for all the fun, and the friendship, and the hugs and the laughter and the most magical of memories. Oh, it's gotta be 'Crocodile Dundee'. A real Aussie movie. Yeah, loved it. 'Dundee' one and two are the best movies ever. This is not a knife. But this is a knife. Now, say it again. Oh, no... That's not a knife! This is a knife! That's it! This is a knife. (UPBEAT MUSIC) John Foreman, ladies and gentlemen. (APPLAUSE) Now, every now and then there is that special person that comes into your world, that you look up to, you admire. Someone that serves as a mentor, someone to aspire to become as great as. And, for Shaun Micallef, I am that man. (LAUGHTER) And it's his absolute pleasure to be here tonight. Ladies and gentlemen, Shaun Micallef. (APPLAUSE) Thank you very much. Thank you. Now I've been sitting here quietly, seething, for the last seven hours. (LAUGHTER) People have been very mean about Paul and then they say one nice thing at the end. (LAUGHTER) And I'm appalled by that, Paul, on your behalf. OK. I would like to say nice things about Paul and then end with one mean thing. (LAUGHTER) Here we go. When Shane came and asked me to do this roast he said, "John, would you like to do this gig?" And I said, "Absolutely, Shane "I would be delighted to come along. "In fact, I'll even turn up." And then he's on his way and I said, "Hang on, just one moment, "who's it for?" And he said, "Paul Hogan," and I said, "Absolutely I will be..." This is all nice stuff. "I will be there with bells on "because I am a big admirer of Paul Hogan." Not his comedy so much. (LAUGHTER) To be honest with you, if it was Barry Humphries, absolutely, I'd be a little happier about the project this evening... (LAUGHTER) ..but I do admire his dramatic acting. (LAUGHTER) I liked 'Anzacs'. Anyone seen 'Anzacs'? (CHEERING) Ah, if you haven't seen it there are some... Don't watch the whole thing on YouTube but there are a couple of very good clips of Paul doing some proper acting. And I have never seen that sort of acting before. Not from him anyway. (LAUGHTER) It was good stuff. Absolutely good stuff. And he has never, never acted properly since. (LAUGHTER) He's done the comedy films and that's fine. They've been very successful, 'Crocodile Dundee'. Anybody seen 'Crocodile Dundee'? Raise you arm up. Oh, sure, absolutely. Now 'Crocodile Dundee' did very well. Very, very successful film. I would like to tell you about it if you haven't seen it. Give you a little bit of a summation of it. It's not a bad film. He plays a character who doesn't understand how things work. I mean, that's a fair enough description of Mick Dundee. He goes to, like, a... He goes up to an automatic door, he doesn't know what it... And it opens and he's amazed! Amazed at such a thing would happen. It's a bit like... Anyone seen 'The Gods Must Be Crazy'? (LAUGHTER) It's a bit like that except with a white guy. (LAUGHTER) And, you know, great scenes. I mean, gave rise to a catchphrase that is still living on in popular culture today. I mean, I'll just recreate the scene. And correct me if I'm wrong, Paul. He's threatening a marginalised group of youths with a knife and he says, "I am a..." I think I got this right, "I'm gonna kill you, and stab you to death with this knife." (LAUGHTER) It's been a while since I've seen the film. (LAUGHTER) I'm going to murder you! And he chases them, from memory I think he does, he chases them down the street and he kills them. He's stabbing them to death. (LAUGHTER) Puts them in the back of the limo and drives up into the Hollywood hills and buries them. And dances about on their grave. (LAUGHTER) Great comedy scene. (LAUGHTER) And, you know, it's huge ever since, I don't think a day goes by, Paul, when someone doesn't drive past in a car and yells out to Paul, "Paul Hogan! "I'm gonna kill you with this knife!" (LAUGHTER) Now then he did a sequel, ladies and gentlemen. The sequel, it was a brilliant sequel. Whereas the first film was about an Australian who goes to America this one was about an Australian who leaves America and comes back to Australia. Then there was another sequel, 'Crocodile Dundee 3'. Paul, you remember that? Absolutely. And having told the same story forwards and backwards... (LAUGHTER) ..he chose in 'Crocodile Dundee 3' to tell the story inside out. (LAUGHTER) OK, so the first one is... Just so you follow... An Australian goes to America, the second one is an Australian comes back to Australia and in this one an Australian in America who stays there. (LAUGHTER) Mick Dundee lives in Beverly Hills and he solves a crime. It was like 'Beverly Hills Cop' except with a white guy. (LAUGHTER) Then there was kind of another sequel. It was the third sequel, it was the fourth in the series the 'Very Excellent Mr Dundee'. And having told the same story forwards and backwards and inside out, he chose on this occasion not to tell any story at all. (LAUGHTER) This'll work very well as a eulogy at some point. (LAUGHTER) Oh, that's sad. In fact what time is it now? Alright. But I wanna tell you, I want to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, Paul's fans are very loyal. Very loyal. And you are evidence of that, ladies and gentlemen, in fact you're the hottest audience in town. (CHEERS) Yes, alright. They've stuck with you, Paul, through thick and thin, but at the end of the day, Paul is a lot more famous than I am, he's a lot more successful than I am, and he has more money than even he would care to admit to the Australian Taxation Office. (LAUGHTER) Paul, it's been a... It's been a pleasure for me to actually stand here just next to you, just in proximity of you. We're at Covid-safe distance, it is a pleasure. I wish it could have been under happier circumstances and can I just say that I think the open casket was a bad idea. (LAUGHTER) Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, Shaun Micallef! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I'd really like to get Wally the kind of thing you can only buy in America. Oh. Hello. (LAUGHTER) Maybe one of those cushions that say, "I Love New York." (APPLAUSE) 'The Paul Hogan Show'. Absolutely loved it. Hoges is the best. I grew up with him. I absolutely love him. Always coming up with one-liners. I reckon cleaning the dishes in the shower. Where he ate those raw eggs... I reckon Leo Wanker, it was one of my great favourites growing up in the '70s. It was fantastic. NARRATOR: Would any of you deliberately risk your life by riding a motorbike through a wall of fire? Now meet a man who does just that. In an incredible display of courage, stuntman-extraordinaire Leo Wanker risks his life as he takes on the Wall of Death. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) Our next roaster wanted to be a gynaecologist because he was too short to be a dentist. Let that settle in for a while. Having failed at both he turned to comedy. This'll be like pulling teeth. Ladies and gentlemen, Troy Kinne! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) Thank you. Wow, what an absolute honour to be here for me tonight. Just gazing over the stage, I honestly can't believe I'm officially part of the Who's-Who of Who-Gives-A-Shit. (LAUGHTER) I mean, if you look at just the average age of everyone up here, I'm genuinely concerned that people watching at home are thinking, "Is this a roast or a commercial for incontinence pads?" (LAUGHTER) Thank you Shane Jacobson, obviously, for hosting this tribute to Hoges, which is quite fitting, when you think about it, to have the host be an old white guy who made one good movie, and has been dining out on it ever since. (LAUGHTER) But I need do need to be careful what I say around Shane he's obviously a big boy. Most men keep a condom in their wallet. Shane keeps a couple of moist towelettes because he gets pies with sauce a lot more often than he gets laid. (LAUGHTER) And Steve Vizard, another ageing legend. So glad he's here, great to meet him. We've actually got a betting pool going out the back, that what's now bigger? Steve's ego or his prostate? (LAUGHTER) John Paul Young is here. How amazing is that? To have John Paul Young in the house. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) And to be fair, probably the only one that's obvious why they're actually here, because John Farnham, Kylie Minogue, Tina Arena, Kate Ceberano, Guy Sebastian, Brian Mannix, Nikki Webster, Warwick Capper, the bloke who sang 'Shaddap You Face' and my uncle Mike who can fart Flame Trees, couldn't make it. (LAUGHTER) There's actually a rumour going around, I don't know if you've heard it? That John Paul Young was arrested for snorting cocaine off a hooker's boobs. (CHEERING) (LAUGHTER) But John did clear it all up and say that he was just researching for his first movie role. 'The John Paul Young Story'. (LAUGHTER) But seriously, it actually is a bit overwhelming being up for me here on stage with so much genuine talent. I literally grew up worshipping Paul Hogan and John Paul Young. I remember as a kid hoping that one day I could grow up and be an awesome singer like John Paul Young, or an awesome actor like Robert De Niro. (LAUGHTER) But we can all agree Paul has created many of Australia's most iconic characters, hasn't he? Arthur Dunger, Leo Wanker, Crocodile Dundee, and his new character he's showcasing tonight, confused old man trying not to fall asleep. (LAUGHTER) And people always ask about whether or not Hoges has had a facelift. That's come up a bit, hasn't it? My personal opinion after seeing him tonight is that he definitely has not. Yeah. (LAUGHTER) But then again, during 'Crocodile Dundee 3', I did think it was Joan Rivers in a hat. (LAUGHTER) Paul Hogan, my sense of humour and everything I've done, experienced and achieved because of it, would simply be less if it wasn't for you. Thank you so much, my friend. (APPLAUSE) The next roaster is more a guest than a roaster, she's not a comedian, she's not an entertainer, but she is a successful Channel 7 journalist and the only person on this stage that has the right to call the man of honour Pa. Ladies and gentlemen, Paul Hogan's granddaughter, the delightful Mylee Hogan! (APPLAUSE AND CHEER) Hi. OK, well to be honest, I was pretty nervous about being here this evening and I spoke to the producers and as they were trying to convince me, I said, "But doesn't everyone have to be funny?" And they said to me, "No, not at all. "Tom Gleeson has agreed to do it." (LAUGHTER) Growing up with Paul Hogan as your grandfather is a really interesting thing. It is especially interesting for other people. Everyone else always wants to talk to you about it. They have a million questions for you. They want to know what he's been up to, where he's been, "He must be so funny "walking around cracking jokes all the time?" Well, the reality is, Pa is a pretty average dude. My childhood memories consist of a man who sits on the couch reading the paper back-to-front, while eating a Devon and tomato sauce sandwich on white bread and drinking coffee from a can. (LAUGHTER) Look, actually, he lives such a simple life with us it is bordering on boring. Just recently, when the borders came down, I flew to LA to visit him and I hadn't seen him in years. So, I was really excited about it, we were going to go to lunch. I was running late, so I was already in trouble because I'd messed with the timetable and then as we were walking down the road I knew exactly where we were going without him even needing to say a word. We went to the exact same cafe that we'd eaten at two years prior, pre-pandemic. Except this time, it was closed. So instead of walking ten, 20, 30 metres down the road to one of the dozens of cafes along Venice Beach, we turned around and we went home. (LAUGHTER) And for lunch that day he made me a turkey and cheese sandwich. (LAUGHTER) Now, on this short walk he had on his joggers and jeans. This is a regular choice of outfit for him. As you can see this evening, he is actually wearing his fancy joggers, his black ones. (LAUGHTER) Now a lot of comedians do dress like this. I've noticed Seinfeld, he wears a lot of joggers and jeans, which makes sense because my Pa is a huge Seinfeld fan. In fact, in our house Seinfeld is such a big deal that at Christmas we have festivus for the rest of us. Hmm, we do. We have the whole shebang, the feats of strength, all together, and Pa's favourite part is to hold the aluminium pole and make his way around the table and tell all of us just how much we've disappointed him over the last 12 months. (LAUGHTER) It's going to be a tough Christmas for me this year. So my Pa first made a name for himself in the '70s selling Winfield cigarettes. They went on to become the biggest selling brand in Australia. He followed that up by going to London and making Fosters the biggest selling brand of Aussie beer in the UK. So you could say that my Pa is possibly the most successful, biggest drug dealer in Australia of all time. (LAUGHTER) That is certainly not boring, Pa, I'll give you that one. For the rest of these jokers here who think they know a thing or two about my Pa, and call him a so-called friend, well, I heard a bit of chit-chat, backstage. There's that old guy there who looks like a bloated Jeremy Clarkson who was backstage trying to find something funny to joke about my Pa's beautiful big smile. But Pa, I think your teeth look fantastic. So you just don't listen to any of them. Ernie Dingo, the so-called great mate, spruiking that he was the best actor in 'Croc Dundee 2'. Settle down, that's like being the best batsman on the English Cricket Team. Hardly a brag. Oooh. As they say, I can say it, I'm family. But don't be coming after my family while I'm around because to you he may be Paul Hogan, Hoges, Crocodile Dundee, this great Australian icon. But to me he's my Pa, my grandfather, and I love him very much. After the break, Tom Gleeson! Hi. Glenn Shorrock here, coming to you live from the 27th floor above Sydney Harbour. I have some fond memories, and they include 'Strop' and all the rest of the cast of the 'Hogan Show'. We were at the top of our game, back then. And it's kind of ironic, isn't it, that one of the sketches featured me as a tax inspector one of the first to get up your nose, shall we say. All the best, mate. Cheers. For the last two or so years we have all had to sit back and watch this insidious virus wreak havoc on innocent people across this great nation of ours. And tonight we have him in the venue with us, Ladies and gentlemen, Tom Gleeson, socially distanced! Yes! Hello! Alright. Paul Hogan, it's great to finally 'meet you. I wish I met you in your prime but here we are. Hopefully, this show does really well. You never know, this could be your first hit since 1986! I do respect you, though, a little. I must, because I left the ABC to come here and slum it with you at Channel 7. Shane is comfortable with the low standards at Channel 7. I'm not so comfortable. He's happy to host a talent show for kids called 'Little Big Shits' or whatever it's called. I'm a game show host. I think they got me because Andrew O'Keefe is in jail. So Paul, it must have been tough during the pandemic for you. I'm guessing that when you had to isolate you just had to go to a cinema that was playing 'The Very Excellent Mister Dundee'. You could have had the place to yourself for weeks! You were in that film, weren't you, Shane? There's those low standards again. Ernie Dingo, you used to work for Channel 7 on a show called 'The Great Outdoors'. And now the great outdoors is just where he lives. Oh, must be so exciting doing a gig where you get shelter. John Paul Young is here. Yes, JPY, you were big in the '80s! But so was HIV. Ah, I love Kerri-Anne. We need more Kerri-Anne Kennerley on TV, don't we? Yeah, backstage she was telling me she was worried that she was gonna be labelled as a racist again by Yumi Stynes. And I said, "Kerri-Anne, that's Alex Lee." Alex Lee is, of course, the host of 'Win The Week'! That was the sound of no-one knowing what your show is. Yeah, no, I can hear it. Yeah. 'Win The Week' is an ABC show that was in 'Hard Quiz's' timeslot and was named after what 'Hard Quiz' used to do in the ratings before you fouled up my timeslot. Obviously, we had to bring a lot of ABC talent onto this show to prop it up. We've got Steve Vizard and I, we work on 'Hard Quiz' which gets a lot of viewers for the ABC before Christie and Shaun lose them again with 'Mad As Hell'. Mathematically accurate, that line. Troy Kinne had a sketch show called 'Kinne on 7mate'. Which is a bit like winning a gold medal, but at the Commonwealth Games. Like, it's exciting but no-one knows it happened. Troy, your sketch show gives us an insight into what 'The Paul Hogan Show' would've been like if Paul had no charisma. So Paul, when you came up with 'The Paul Hogan Show', were you at home watching 'The Benny Hill Show' and thought, "This is a bit too clever?" Tonight, Paul, I want you to apologise for making everyone around the world think all Australians are blonde, tanned and love the beach. When I was a kid, that was tough for me. I've got red hair and fair skin. You know, I never fit your stereotype. It was tough. Imagine how Yumi Stynes feels. You used to advertise anything! You were the face of Fosters Lager, which is a beer that best represents your career. It was really popular in the '80s but now it's piss that you couldn't force on anyone. You also made a lot of ads for cigarette companies. I mean, who would you make an ad for now? Russia? "Oh, I'll throw another conscript on the barbie for ya!" I looked up to you when I was kid. You made me want to get a tan, you made me want to smoke. What other cancers could've you inspired me to get? I have to mention the shrimp on the barbie. I mean, I can see why you'd like shrimp. You know, with a shrimp you break off the bit you don't want and you throw it away. Like your marriages! After 'Crocodile Dundee', you married Linda Kozlowski. So, after 'Strange Bedfellows', why didn't you marry Michael Caton? Of course, for our younger viewers, 'Strange Bedfellows' was a film in which Paul pretended to be gay in a film that pretended to be entertaining. Why are you even doing this roast? Like, you're supposed to do a roast to boost your profile. You're at the end of your career. Or are you trying to get the corner room at the aged care home? And to finish I just want to say obviously I'm doing this because I'm a big fan. You're the most famous Australian comedian of all time, a height that all of us will never reach. I've said that because it's true and because I know it will piss off Hughesy. Paul, thank you for having me and what's your accountant's phone number? Thank you. A round of applause. Tom Gleeson! After the break, Paul Hogan has his revenge. Well, the time has come for the right of reply. We have all had our go at poking fun at Hoges, but in the true spirit of tit-for-tat, it's finally time to hear from the man himself. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the lectern, my mate and mentor, the one, the only, Paul Hogan! (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) Where am I, again? What an interesting evening it's been. No, I've been sitting here being insulted by people I hardly know. Oh, I'm very flattered to be here and have all these insults and adulation poured onto me especially from such an illustrious group. Oh, John-Paul Young! What happened to you? Thanks for coming, mate. Mr Vizard. When I look at you, mate, I think, compassion and pity. No, not for you. For your parents. Ah, the handsome guy with the grey hair. Sean Micallef, yeah, yeah. Why is he here? Why are they doing jokes about Kerri-Anne? Kerri-Anne looks fabulous. Yeah, yeah. You don't do jokes about people looking old. And Kerri-Anne's not old anyway. She's still a babe. Yeah, I'd give her a nudge. Yeah, and I'd know. I'm pretty fussy. Speaking of people I don't know, these three young 'uns here two pretty ladies and the kid at the end, no-one should be mocking you in any way, shape or form because you're all young, you're reasonably attractive, you've got at least half a brain between the three of you and it's not too late for you to get a proper job. You know, yeah. You don't have to hang around with this mob. In the old days, when I worked on the coat hanger, I spent my days surrounded by, you know, blue singlets, blue-collar workers salt of the earth, all steady sort of guys, boring, most of them, but steady and then I suddenly found myself in the world of show business! And thought, all of a sudden I'm surrounded by drug addicts and sexual deviants, purposeless ego-trippers and all sorts of weird rubbish. But nonetheless I'm grateful that they did turn up here tonight. But they're not all strangers. One of them is, in fact, is related to me. You'll end up not being in the will. And my fabulous mate here. He's an old mate. And I want to thank him, and we should all be grateful that he turned up tonight, because he had to dodge a couple of his regular jobs. Just to be here with us tonight. I heard someone else is gonna have to do the weather on Channel 9 in Newcastle, tonight. And people who have gone to the greyhound racing at Dapto Dogs there's some stranger calling the race. Won't be the same. But your new show though, it's not live. So thank God. You don't know it, yet, but Shane is going to be the host of 'Real Housewives of Rooty Hill'. You'll be great. Another old mate, here. This is a man that I'm so proud of. The man I'm talking about, to me, is the best actor and the funniest comic that ever came out of Pakistan. I'm talking about Ashwan Kahn, my friend. Oh, you probably all know him by his stage name. Ernie Dingo. When he told me his plan, I said, "Get yourself a real Australian name, Ashwan." Don't deny it. I suggested he call himself Billy Koala, but no. He wouldn't listen. Called himself Ernie Dingo. If, by any chance, and I never do, if I've offended anyone at all in any way, tonight, and you have the urge to come up here on stage and slap me across the face, I wouldn't think of it for long. I'm thrilled and honoured to be here with these people. Well, most of them. But thanks everyone. And goodnight. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) Ladies and gentlemen, Paul Hogan! Ladies and gentlemen, remember, be kind to your loved ones but don't forget, it's OK to roast your mates. Goodnight Australia! Take care, everyone!
