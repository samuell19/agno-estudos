What here in this fusty atmosphere I might have known it would come to this Nationally recognised actor My God I used not to set foot in this sort of inn not even to pass water And they expect me to play my Wheel of History here The Black Hart ah well it's as if time had stood still As if you hadn't known that we were coming today Desolate Total lack of culture desolate Utzbach Utzbach like Butzbach Bruscon, the nationally recognised actor in Utzbach My comedy in this wretched Utzbach The Black Hart ah well It's so sultry there'll be a thunderstorm Such a sensitive spirit in such a sensitive body Haven't you got a chair an armchair You said frittata soup Naturally The only thing worth eating around here is frittata soup But not too greasy there's always all that fat floating on the soup even in frittata soup as provincialism celebrates its triumphs In Gaspoltshofen we had a huge success dazzling ideal conditions Did my daughter Sarah tell you that I must have a second pillow And it must be horsehair I'm sure you'll have no trouble providing me with a horsehair pillow The horsehair pillow is already on the bed It’s already on the bed you say it’s already on the bed Theories do not accord with practice How many inhabitants did you say Two hundred and eighty Two hundred and eighty A midget community Incredible In Gaspoltshofen we had eight hundred and thirty in the house all paying full price all of them applauding absolutely enthusiastically If I had known that this this Utzbach that this Utzbach had only two hundred and eighty inhabitants Old people who can neither hear nor see The Wheel of History is a humana comedia Caesar Napoleon Churchill appear which is not to say that the distaff side is short-changed Basically I have survived on nothing but frittata soup on this whole tour In Gaspoltshofen it was extraordinarily tasty Scarcely any fat And of course Metternich plays a decisive role in my comedy which in fact is a tragedy as you will see The nature of things is always the opposite, my dear sir We go on a tour but all we actually do is walk into a trap into a theatre trap so to speak Have you seen the fire chief yet about the emergency exit light As I said it must be pitch dark at the end of my comedy even the exit light must be out perfectly dark at the end of my comedy if it's not perfectly dark my Wheel of History will be ruined If the exit light is not off my comedy will be perverted into its exact opposite In Gaspoltshofen they extinguished the light in Frankenmarkt too even in Ried-im-Innkreis which after all is infamous for being one of the most stupid places Tell the fire chief that I am Bruscon Bruscon the nationally recognised actor who played Faust in Berlin and Mephisto in Zurich Firemen are pigheaded statistics show that every year they cause more havoc than anyone else Once a building's on fire the firemen totally destroy it This sultriness On the other hand I'll catch cold if I take my coat off Racked with coughing every moment of my life tortured with sore throats bathed in perspiration Don't you dare do you want me to sit in a draft What a foul stench Is there still money in pig breeding Or is it just innkeepers' perversity This ubiquitous stench of pigs From one pig breeding institute to another The fact is there's nothing here but pig breeding institutes and churches and Nazis If we can’t to switch off the exit light we won’t perform This place is a scourge of God And it's for this that I attended the academy for this I was decorated with the gold cross on the blue ribbon Agatha warned me Sooner or later the disaster was bound to happen If we think clearly we're bound to do away with ourselves Utzbach The stage in Gaspoltshofen was no larger In Ried-im-Innkreis it was two metres wider but that was only a drawback For me it's not such a disaster as it is for my wife she is allergic to the stench of pigs there's something wrong with her lungs she struggles even in the purest air And she makes a half-hour speech to the people of Rome no allowances made Every word here stirs up dust and my comedy's infernal text Your Excellency I regret More or less a comedy of creation without going so far as to call it epoch-making Calabria don't make me laugh A late work indubitably Have you read about it All nonsense like everything in the newspapers Incompetent hacks But not one of them tore it to bits not one of them qualified but not one tore it to bits My wife suffers from continual headaches there's something wrong with my kidneys Just as long as we don't fall through In Gaspoltshofen they had a new floor this one is all mouldy and rotten Don't you have dances on this platform any more It doesn't look as if anyone has danced on this platform in recent years It seems only old people live here nowadays and they don't dance no theatrical performances here for ages Would you please bring one of the tables over here Our sets are virtually non-existent as simple as can be We use a screen three times that's all As you see we travel with only a trunk and a laundry basket nothing else Put the table over there Over there The lighting is what really counts Our imagination even our intellect have to be rearranged constantly in the end nothing corresponds Put the table there Yes that's the place for the table at least for the moment for the moment Imagination magic Do you know St. Radegund Where is it It's ten kilometres further on Ten kilometres really that's what I thought Ten kilometres you say Ten kilometres I was assaulted there in nineteen hundred and forty-four by a butcher's assistant who mistook me for a candlemaker alleged to have hailed from Mattighofen I still have these pains in my shoulder plaguing my life which would be burdensome enough even without that episode It's been forty years since that crime took place I was still a student at the time I was studying theatre history not as you think at a university I was completely self-taught after all I came into this area I forget how and was assaulted in St. Radegund it might well have been the end of me I wore extra long trousers in those days and a linen cap on my head I called it my cap of advantage for I soon found out it was an advantage to think while wearing that cap If I wanted to think clearly I would put that cap on the linen cap I inherited from my grandfather on my mother's side And imagine I couldn't manage to think even in the city without that linen cap of my grandfather's at least not with the necessary clarity which I’ve raised to a point of principle in the end I wore that cap whenever I worked on my comedy If I take the cap off my comedy will be ruined that's what I always thought I kept it on the whole nine years I was working on my comedy our Wheel of History that is I tell you unless the emergency exit light is switched off we shan't perform What sort of people are they anyway these fire chiefs It's simply ludicrous that here in in in Utzbach In Utzbach there even is a fire chief in this hole of holes you'll forgive me calling your village a hole I'm sure you respect a fire chief who won’t allow the exit light switched off for five minutes Really only five minutes without an emergency exit light at the end of my comedy Even in Ried-im-Innkreis there was no debate on that point The light grows dim finally very dim and finally it goes out completely naturally the emergency exit light as well The climax of my comedy is perfect darkness that is the sine qua non if it isn't to be perverted into its opposite Churchill wakes up in the night before his death his parting word is Elba then it becomes perfectly dark My son Ferruccio by the way is a phenomenal Churchill Ferruccio you know because I am an admirer of Busoni In the scene with Stalin Churchill stamps on the floor it would be disastrous if the floor didn't hold The audience would inevitably burst out laughing and that would be the end of my comedy In Gaspoltshofen my son stamped on the floor with such emphasis that he injured his leg up to the knee but the performance was not interrupted It caused a short break I as Stalin simply said some lines that we had originally cut then I picked up my son that is I picked up Churchill and carried him out I dragged him out more than carried him which gave rise to thunderous applause Shakespeare Voltaire and I I already had the idea for my play in Le Havre where I met my wife a coastal acquaintanceship so to speak Atlantic coastal acquaintanceship Bertrand you are tempting fate The dampness here muffles everything Everything here militates against the human voice Incidentally I was only fourteen when I sketched out my comedy The theme pursued me all my life to so speak a sort of theatrum mundi Thought which sought no reward you understand a certain talent for the theatre even as a child a born man of the theatre you know histrionic setter of traps even very early in life Broke away from home cuffs on the ears blows beaten over the head by my father Total mutual contempt Sadistic in a certain sense autosadistic Worked my way up from the very bottom The poison is in Lorrach The poison is stored in Lorrach the poison which will wipe out humanity That my dear sir is the Lorrach effect in my Wheel of History So-called power wielders fire chiefs In Gaspoltshofen I had no trouble at all Tell the fire chief that it's only a matter of five minutes five decisive minutes to be sure if at the end of my play there are not five minutes of total darkness my play will be ruined that would make this place the one exception I am not inclined to enter into a debate with the fire chief it's just a question of his agreeing to five minutes with no exit light five minutes of total darkness preposterous The whole world in its nethermost recesses is made bilious by absurd laws This abominable hole you don't even have fires here there never has been a fire as you yourself admitted it's preposterous to insist the exit light cannot even be out for five minutes In this dampness since everything is rotten there's no possibility of a fire breaking out tell the fire chief that What's his name anyway Attwenger Attwenger Herr Fireman Attwenger Herr Fire Chief Attwenger What does this fire chief Attwenger do for a living anyway He's a wright Wright wright What sort of a wright Wheelwright wheelwright in this day and age wheelwright wheelwright and fire chief Go and tell him who I am and tell him that his family will of course get complimentary tickets The wheelwright has no family any longer No longer Then tell him he'll get a copy of my play with my autograph with Bruscon's autograph who never gives such autographs who has always refused to give such autographs one of my personal autographs will be worth a fortune one day when I am known as a great dramatist as well as Bruscon the great actor and tell him he may dine with us with us at our own table But how did they come to die on him the family Struck by lightning sir They went on an outing to Haag and stood under a birch tree they were all killed except the wheelwright And yet they always say if you're in the lurch find a birch Tell you what landlord before you go to the fire chief order us some frittata soup from the kitchen four frittata soups of course it's unusual to order frittata soup at this time We'll eat the frittata soup here on this table my son my daughter and I send my wife's frittata soup up to her room poor woman she's still in a state of shock Utzbach sounds like a charming place she said on her way here and then when she saw Utzbach she fainted Histrionic type of course But it's just as well if she retires before the performance otherwise she'll forget her lines she forgets her lines all the time we've played the same thing for years and she still loses her lines and always at crucial points my dear sir, it could drive you mad You have no idea how difficult it is to remember the lines in a play like this let alone to turn those lines into a work of art which this text is without a shadow of doubt Women create tremendous difficulties on the stage they've never understood anything They don't go to extremes they don't go to hell to the hell of the theatre everything they do is half-hearted half-heartedness that they understand but this half-heartedness is the death of the theatre But what would a comedy like mine be without female performers we need them If our comedy is to flourish we need women in our comedy that's the truth however bitter it may be If you only knew what it cost me to teach my wife the most rudimentary rules of acting even the most obvious things demand years of martyrdom on the one hand we need female performers on the other hand they spell death to the theatre As far as women are concerned we mustn't exaggerate our chivalry or our mendacity will become too obvious Just the word Odense she had to say it eight thousand times before I was able to accept it Odense What could be simpler to say Odense quite softly took my wife years before she could say it acceptably When we utter the word sea we have to know what the sea is that's self-evident or the words rat poison whatever that is it's self-evident but not for women They have to be trained for decades to understand the simplest thing And how difficult it is when the woman is one's own wife whom we have after all taken forever so to speak Making scenes with women is a disaster When we engage a female performer we engage so to speak a theatrical monkey wrench and it's always female performers who kill the theatre even if we never frankly admit it because we are too chivalrous to do so a female tragedienne has always been an absurdity after all since a tragedy in and of itself is nothing more than an insane idea If we are honest theatre is itself an absurdity but if we are honest we can't put on theatre neither can we if we are honest write a play or act one if we are honest we can't do anything but do away with ourselves but as we don't do away with ourselves because we don't want to since we have not done away with ourselves up till now we keep giving the theatre another try we write for the theatre we perform in the theatre even though that is the absurdest thing and the most mendacious How can an actor play a king when he doesn't have the faintest idea what a king is how can an actress play a stable lass when she doesn't have the faintest idea what a stable lass is An actor's representation is always a misrepresentation simply mendacious and for that very reason it is theatre Representation is mendacity and represented mendacity is what we love That's how I've written my comedy mendacious that's how we present it mendacious and that's how it's received mendacious The writer is mendacious the actors are mendacious and the audience is mendacious too and the sum total is one single absurdity and we are dealing with a perversity dating back for millennia the theatre is a millennial perversity which humanity is besotted with and so deeply besotted because it is so deeply besotted with its mendacity and nowhere else in this humanity is mendacity greater and more fascinating than in the theatre My finger will not dry in this hall dampness like this is poison to the theatre My words carried in Gaspoltshofen here everything is dispersed everything shrivels up here the most extraordinary things become dilettantish Austria Degenerate is the right word Gone to seed is the right expression As a matter of fact I did have an Austrian grandmother a great grandmother by the name of Irrsiegler But that means nothing to you Something Tyrolean in my nature something perverse too Austria grotesque under endowed is the right word mentally incompetent is the right expression Mozart Schubert odious predominance Believe me nothing about this people is engaging anymore Wherever we go smallness of mind xenophobia hatred of art Nowhere else is art received with the same obtuseness Art, art art here they do not even know what that is The true artist is dragged down into the mire but the mendacious good-for-nothing is loved they bow and scrape to the charlatan Landlord of an inn in Utzbach what an existence Did you grow up here or did you marry into this Utzbach Married into it Herr Bruscon Married into it married into it where from From Gaspoltshofen From Gaspoltshofen To be honest with you I was rather taken by Gaspoltshofen quite different sort of people quite different conditions from here in Utzbach didn't stink of pigs no pestiferous silos But why not stay in Gaspoltshofen You unlucky fellow To come to Utzbach for the sake of a woman You'd probably have developed better in Gaspoltshofen Who knows you had no alternative The female lures the male from the most beautiful region into the worst of holes But when did you come here Forty-six Forty-six fateful fateful In Gaspoltshofen I had no way of making a living after my father died No way of making a living Early loss of his father And your mother's still alive What did she die of Of gastronomy Of gastronomy It wasn't her fault in the least We were leasing a lunch counter A lessee's fate there is nothing more tragic than the fate of a lessee and worst of all the gastronomic fate A gastronomic lessee is a misfortune in any case There were eight brothers and three sisters in three beds in a cold and damp cellar You had no choice but to marry into gastronomy It's possible that Utzbach was your salvation This awful Utzbach in which I would die of Catholic depression if I had to spend another day here was your salvation This architectural helplessness the honour of these walls the frightfulness of the ceiling the repulsiveness of the doors and windows this monument to bad taste has provided for your continued existence we often ask ourselves are we or is the world mad Innkeeper in Utzbach if that isn't lunacy complete lunacy The most complete lunacy of all times He who exists has made his peace with existence he who lives has made his peace with life the part we play cannot be so preposterous that we do not not play it We brought curtains to completely cover all the windows special curtains we had them made in the Klepper works in Rosenheim they cost eighty thousand but without them our comedy would be totally impossible We also have special hooks in our luggage which we can nail into any wall it doesn't matter what sort of wall we can nail them in Our lights are from a special factory in Recklinghausen We have the advantage of travelling in a single van and this van is not by any means uncomfortable As if you hadn't known we were coming today but you knew perfectly well The fact that no one opened the door until we had knocked persistently on it is a perverse singularity And when the weather is so sultry there is a stench of butchery On the other hand it is advantageous to stay at an inn where butchery is done on the premises No, I do not think that in the circumstances we can air this room out if we open the windows we shall be lost But when do you feed the pigs At half past five Usually half past five That's no problem In Mattighofen we were told there'd been a death in the family so the pigs were fed at half past eight they disrupted everything by grunting the pigs grunting ruined the whole play At first we wanted to call a halt but then we decided to carry on The play was ruined right at the climax by the pigs grunting To be honest with you I didn't care I didn't have a true sense of mission in Mattighofen I think people there only came to our play to cool off because it was as sultry as it is here We did an abridged version in Mattighofen Cut the Einstein scene everything that is said about the atom bomb in my play a definitive statement to be sure we managed without this scene in Mattighofen Of course that was the great hiatus in my play but there was terrific applause we were given a bonus in Mattighofen a wheel of cheese but my wife doesn't eat cheese I myself do not like cheese and my children are totally opposed to cheese So we drag this great wheel of cheese around possibly we'll find someone to take it off our hands The wheel of cheese weighs forty-three kilograms It presses heavily on our rear axle By the way Sarah is driving because Ferruccio has a broken hand in Zwicklett my son plunged from the second floor on his way to the toilet fateful slip could easily have killed him but my children are very limber Here the privy's outside as well I can't ask my wife to go outside to the privy Please put two chamber pots in our room Liver dumpling soup or frittata soup that was always the question till I finally decided in favour of frittata soup Your wife was so strangely silent when she admitted us She scarcely said "good day" I know this region is unequalled for unfriendliness but a short friendly greeting does the person arriving a lot of good The further down the Danube the more unfriendly it becomes sultry and unfriendly not to say really misanthropic A journey through this region is anything but appetising Therefore I mostly eat even my frittata soup with my eyes closed and actually almost always enjoy it Don't torture me please go and ask whether it's possible for us to have a frittata soup here and now The soup by which we exist so to speak Wheelwright and fire chief What funny people there are wielding the sceptre of power the most ridiculous brings about the fall of the most sublime Disgusting When Agatha sees this Nothing but filth and stench and these ugly prints they'll all have to go I am not going to perform with these prints on the wall This hall is a proper spirit-killer Rent for the hall don't make me laugh Bruscon isn't paying rent for the hall for a pigsty like this Caesar can enter from the back there but Napoleon cannot enter from down left that won't work here But the Caesar-Napoleon scene can't be cut We might be able to manage without Hitler No not here no we've got to have Hitler here Then Sarah enters and says Ludwig how could you Ferruccio replies do not insult me after all I'm not shooting at him We could leave that out like everything in fact concerning love leave out love But not entirely everything is equally important In my Wheel of History everything is equally important poor Agatha on the other hand I don't feel a bit sorry for her Women make a scene Men are the scene Women make a scene that's the difficulty Basically children without talent taken nothing in told them everything heard nothing showed them everything saw nothing The father can say what he likes it's no use The mother spoils everything the father accomplished Feebleminded son more or less stupid daughter wife who constantly thinks she's been slighted driving me crazy Product of the proletariat proletarian product I after all did not want to do the tour I was always against this tour but she kept tormenting me with her good country air I gave in Consumptives are difficult people well-nigh insufferable fanatics for perfidy despots of the world so to speak Gave in off we went on our tour disgusting weakness of character on my part The Wheel of History more or less cast before swine If I had staged it in Cologne or Bochum as far as I'm concerned in the Rhineland or the Ruhr everything would have been better This way I've ruined it for myself Always allowing myself to be talked into everything Utzbach Utzbach like Butzbach Half-rotten bed linen torn plastic curtains view of the pigsty If I hadn't seen the thousands of blood stains on the wall from the gnats they've slain they call them midges here She did have the shivers Agatha I said mustn't get sick here in this Utzbach Kiss on the forehead Nothing we can't handle I said Is it possible the frittata soup My wife's already seeing to it Although she's needed to fill sausages To fill sausages It's blood sausage day today Blood sausage day does that mean something It's the day blood sausages are made Blood sausage day Today of all days is blood sausage day here But it won't take long to make a frittata soup I see Then Erna is coming to sweep up Erna is coming Erna who is Erna My daughter I see On blood sausage day we all have to work together so it's not an auspicious day for us For anybody On blood sausage day we usually have no time Usually no time on blood sausage day But never mind Never mind never mind Do you have blood sausage day every week Every Tuesday But all the curtains are done for The ceiling's all cracks More than forty years since it was painted I see and these pictures these landscapes they're nothing but ugly stains behind glass These pictures must come down I can't perform under these ugly pictures Isn't that a picture of Hitler Certainly it is And has it always hung there Certainly it has For decades Certainly You have to look very closely indeed to see that it’s Hitler the glass is so filthy No one's taken umbrage about that so far No one's taken umbrage If you're talking to people from the city your speech is more or less educated at least you make an effort to that end on the one hand that's very commendable on the other Hitler also appears in my play encounters Napoleon and drinks with Roosevelt on the Obersalzberg If I don't cut that scene this evening Hitler's picture can stay on the wall that's not bad at all Goethe gets an attack of coughing and is carried out of the salon by Kierkegaard after Hitler and Napoleon have entered Kierkegaard the great Dane who wrote Either/or of course that means nothing to you When we come to a place it's a stupid place when we meet someone it's someone stupid A thoroughly stupid country populated by people who are thoroughly stupid It doesn't matter who we talk to it turns out that it's a fool it doesn't matter who we listen to it turns out that it's an illiterate they're socialists they claim and are only national socialists they're Catholic they claim and are only national socialists they say they're human and are only idiots Osterreich Austria L'Autriche It seems to me as if we're touring in a cesspool in the pus-filled boil of Europe Why does everything stink round here What a horrible return my dear sir At every street corner it turns your stomach Where there was a wood now it's a gravel pit where there was a meadow now a cement works where there was a human being now a Nazi And all with this electric atmosphere of the Lower Alps where a sensitive person can have an apoplectic fit This tour is proof positive This country is not worth the paper its travel brochures are printed on Utzbach A conspiracy against me against everything that's of any value A trap for art dear sir a trap for art Tell me do you have blood sausage day every week Every Tuesday is blood sausage day Every Tuesday Every Tuesday Is every day sausage day Every other day is sausage day But Tuesday is always blood sausage day Yes Every Tuesday is blood sausage day I should have known If I didn't detest every sausage except for head cheese Then my limbs suddenly give way That confounded Zwicklett My son could have plunged to his death His right arm in a cast at first I thought this is a dreadful calamity but then I saw that it is only people like that with a crippled right arm that my son plays Hitler had a crippled right arm Nero as you know Caesar even Churchill had a crippled right arm the so-called great rulers all had crippled right arms On the contrary with his arm in a cast he plays these so-called great rulers to even greater perfection than before These are parts I wrote specially for my son that anti-talent just like the parts for my daughter and the parts my wife plays gigantic anti-talentism dear sir When we write a comedy even the so-called world comedy we have to take account of the fact that it will be performed by dilettantes by anti-talents The dramatist does well to be cognisant of the fact that only anti-talents will put his play on the stage even if they are the greatest and most famous actors they are anti-talents everyone who treads the boards is an anti-talent and the more grand they appear and the more famous they are the more disgusting is their anti-talent A talented actor is as rare as an arsehole in a face That was an observation made by Pirandello or perhaps I made it myself Pirandello did make such observations but I myself have constantly made such observations most of the time I don't know did I make that observation or did Pirandello make it I don't know So I have to take it as a special honour that you take time for me on blood sausage day of all days when I assume you are certainly needed at the butcher's to fill the blood sausages Put the crate over here here I said here Here Not there for heaven's sake put the crate down here here here where I told you But I said here But the crate is all damp That will spoil the masks this sultry this humid sultry weather of course it will hurt the masks Landlord if you please unlock the crate would you my son is a cripple he is incapable of unlocking the crate Now the fool is a cripple as well But don't you see I'm bathed in sweat my child can't you see that But why did you keep me waiting here so long Left me alone in this dreadful hall where I'll catch a fatal disease forsaken by everyone I sit here with only the landlord for company You see that's what you can expect from your children children you fathered and coddled that they forsake you That ridiculous fracture that's no excuse for total incompetence At least I still have a drop of Italian blood a passion for art a touch of genius my dear sir but there's nothing Italian left in these children My grandfather on my mother's side let me tell you an emigrant's fate from Bergamo across the Alps to Kiel on the Baltic a railroad labourer's fate building the line from Hamburg to Copenhagen my dear sir The great Bruscon never denied his roots Take them off for me I want you to take my shoes off Everything hurts everything I'm nothing but a man of sorrows Do it the way you did in Gaspoltshofen my child from top to bottom from bottom to top the way you did in Gaspoltshofen my child Yes that's the way What on earth are you doing Put the mask back into the crate at once back in the crate at once At once back in the crate What are you thinking it's abominable holding Caesar's mask up to people of that ilk an unworthy creature a landlord an enemy of the arts a hater of the theatre what impudence an abomination Close the crate close it Why are you staring at me who do you think you are Oh what's the use No no stay here everything gets on my nerves here in this in this in this Utzbach Utzbach like Butzbach Forgive me I don't as a rule I never do as a rule but this sultriness Would you mind helping me off with my coat Victims of our passion no matter what we do we are the victims of our passion We are at death's door and behave as though we were immortal we've already reached the end and act as if it could go on and on like this Sarah my child you must stand by me all the more so when it's hell come here You've learned nothing but I love you more than anything And what about mother has she memorised her lines Your mother is an anti-talent but for that very reason I took her and do you know where On the Atlantic coast Exactly on the Atlantic coast Tonight you'll play Caesar slightly muted you understand slightly muted Hitler somewhat more cheerful than usual not as melancholy as in Gaspoltshofen Hitler was not a melancholy man I need Churchill to show a little more sensuality you understand a little more sensuality You say your mother memorised her lines and you went through them with her Probably wasn't any good again She has never been any good she never understood to think of all I have tried to teach her she didn't understand a thing But she brought a beautiful child into the world you Our bourgeois At bottom you were not made for the theatre I'm at my wits end I often say to myself that's our son who cannot appreciate poetry who has no inkling of imagination no inkling of the spirit no inkling of the creative Come here I didn't mean it that way You are my greatest disappointment you know that but you have never disappointed me No one is as useful to me You could serve the frittata soup my dear sir I would like to ask for piping hot soup usually it comes to the table lukewarm That's the price we pay that's what we get for listening to your mother and going on tour because of her precious pulmonary lobes Utzbach that's what this place is called Utzbach like Butzbach The world is cruel my child and spares no one not a single person nothing everything is destroyed by it Whoever thinks he can escape is caught up with immediately everyone's destination is misfortune and the end Look at this frightful hall that's just what I needed And this seedy landlord who exudes such a noisome odour even wants to charge rent for the hall And the fire chief will not allow the exit light switched off I won’t perform I said unless the exit light is extinguished total darkness I said I'm not going to have my comedy ruined in this awful Utzbach place These people don't even deserve to have you come to their village let alone have a theatre company play and the great Bruscon into the bargain Have you mended the wig Yes And you have you patched the shoes Yes Our intensity our travel intensity I mean must not flag of course tonight we shall play the whole comedy I shall cut nothing just because we are where we are Is she still coughing your mother She's still coughing she even coughed while she was doing her lines I thought she'd cough her lines away didn't she take any cough medication Oh yes Why is she coughing then Such beautiful lines such a magnificent passage and she coughs it all away Your mother is a proletarian But I love her she irritates me all the time but I love her Did she speak the passage softly as I told her to What do you mean did she not did she not start the passage softly as I directed She's not to speak it like she did in Gaspoltshofen enough to try the patience of Job I know the two of you are in cahoots You stand by me but you make allowances for your mother's artistic blunders her artistic incompetence you can still hear in every sentence she utters that her father was a bricklayer It's not a disgrace to be a bricklayer but still to notice the bricklayer who was her father in every sentence even to this day that's insidious But the fact is we can always tell with any actor no matter who it is what his father was that's what's depressing my child Unfortunately no one can tell from the two of you that your father is Bruscon the great nationally recognised actor the greatest nationally recognised actor that there ever was You two are born massage artists You ought to have been masseurs you'd have gone far Massage yes acting no Humanity doesn't have the least idea what that is an excellent massage It was I of course who taught you to massage Your mother was an incompetent masseuse too Slowly and very gently There is nothing more necessary than a good massage before going on stimulates the imagination conjures up all the good spirits makes art possible the highest art What an aroma Help me up Are you sure it's really hot The soup is piping hot Frittata soup children Now give your poor frail father a hand to get to the table Nobody knows where frittata soup comes from Probably from Bohemia But it doesn't matter where it comes from frittata soup Mother's here What did you say Mother is here our mother is here Where is she There There, there I don't see her There's mother there Oh yes you Excellent soup quite excellent frittata soup But do sit down everybody do sit down Come on sit down why are you standing there what on earth are you waiting for You coughed the passage away is that true you're surely not serious coughing the passage away as Sarah informs me that's a nice prospect for tonight tonight of all nights when I intended to give a gala performance more or less yes you heard me right a gala performance perhaps some wine sir wine good lord no in Austria no wine in this charming place The children wanted to take a walk to the pond they followed a sign which said “To the Pond” but they ended up in a rubbish dump Utzbach Utzbach like Butzbach Go on eat we haven't had such a good soup for a long time such a good frittata soup Softly my child you know that I don't like you to say these lines too loud Nowadays people bawl their parts in comedies It doesn't matter where we go all we hear is bawling And not only in the provinces even in the great houses people bawl nowadays Very softly in this passage you hear you yourself think that no one can hear you but they have to hear you you speak so softly that you think you can't be heard and you speak very clearly When beauty doth elude us evermore and sickness of the spirit seize our soul and leave us naked to our very core You see that's how it goes you speak so softly that you think no one at all can hear you but that's a mistake The person who speaks perfectly is heard even if he himself speaks so softly that he thinks he can't be heard When beauty doth elude us evermore and sickness of the spirit seize our soul and leave us naked... Not quite once again Unaffected on the one hand the highest artistic penetration on the other you know what I mean When beauty doth elude us... Oh no can't you understand softly Unaffected on the one hand highest artistic penetration on the other When beauty doth elude us evermore and sickness... What is lacking here is the devotion with which you must speak those lines you lack devotion you must speak this in the most devout way too When beauty doth elude us evermore and sickness... lightly softly lightly devoutly my child When beauty doth elude us evermore This is simply impossible as though you had never learned there is no difference between you and the dilettantism rampant today People simply cannot speak anymore Even in our national theatres no one can speak anymore In the most famous theatres in Germany the way people speak today is enough to frighten a pig Perhaps the part is too much for you after all Sometimes I think you take after your mother completely Come to me after the performance and we'll rehearse this passage and if it's two in the morning No excuse I always thought I was an excellent teacher but that was an erroneous assumption I don't expect any flights of genius from Ferruccio but from you my child Come here give me your hand What is your father what is your father Herr Bruscon Impudent girl how dare you This impertinence will cost you dearly Come here here I said I won't abide any argument or any insubordination Now then what is your father tell me what your father is Tell him what he is You keep quiet you ne'er-do-well anti-talent Ferruccio I am an admirer of Busoni but you do no honour to Busoni's genius Well then what is your father What is your father The greatest actor of all times Well at last That's what I wanted to hear Because so far today no one has said that to me yet Running away when the chips are down that's what you all do Come here You're to come here Your father orders you to come here Since it didn't occur to you to tell me who I am it has to be wrung from you I have no other choice We lead a desperate life a frightful existence As though here in Utzbach we had fallen into a trap Have you sewed up the hole I have It had to be velvet and we're still all groaning because of it When it could have been linen In fact linen would have been better No it had to be velvet That's your mother's proletarian megalomania If I'd had my way the costumes would have cost a third no she wanted silk for everything Artificial silk I said silk she said linen I said velvet she said The proletarians demand luxury that's it that's what brings us to the verge of ruin When the proletarians go one better they go the whole hog Our sort are content with a simple meal they order the most expensive dish we ask for simple chicken they order Peking duck we travel economy they travel first class we take a trip if we ever can to Merano at best or to the mountains they go to the Seychelles But I have her under my thumb your mother she wanted you in silk and satin from your earliest childhood cotton was as good you can thank me that you grew up in cotton if your mother had had her way the daughter of a bricklayer she would have spoiled you from the start Since the proletarians have been ruling the world the world has been regressing they promised progress but in truth it's regressing no proof whatsoever is needed just common sense an open eye so to speak Now so-called socialism is presenting us with the bill the coffers are empty Europe is done for It will take a hundred years before what they've ruined is restored What hurts me most is the fact that the proletarians have also destroyed the theatre that's the truth But why am I talking to you who have never yet understood what I was talking about We'll have a lighting rehearsal at six Green light from above onto Churchill's face not like Gaspoltshofen where no light at all fell on Churchill's face And as Lady Churchill you will wear the red shoes You think I never notice anything in Gaspoltshofen you were wearing the black ones Metternich's mistress wears the black ones Even if you don't understand why I know why that's sufficient How about bringing me something to drink I'm dying of thirst here while your mother is taking it easy up there Sheer underhandedness to keep faking illnesses which she simply doesn't have Hysterical that's what it is all this fuss about asthma Why are you still standing there I said Römerquelle or Apollinaris but I'm sure they don't have that here in Utzbach Your mother invests her whole talent in her pretended illnesses instead of in the art of acting I know that she hates my comedy she hates everything about me everything spiritual at any rate Just be thankful that you have me and you needn't suffocate in a marriage That you are artists or at least have the appearance of being artists precious few have any idea what that means artistes if the expression were not so repellent I'd use it more often but it disgusts me Limber that's what you have always been I don't know where you get it from Your mother is stiff and I am clumsy you have always been limber Would you mind very much putting the basket over there yes there no there there Have you been to see the fire chief yet No not yet Why in heaven's name not When I tell you the exit light is the most important thing my comedy can't take an emergency exit light tell the fire chief that your wheelwright don't misunderstand me this isn't a threat we shall not perform if the exit light is not switched off Isn't that right Sarah Isn't that right my son We shall not perform if the exit light is not switched off Now be off with you we are wasting too much time What's the word on supper Hot supper of course An opulent supper theatre style What delicacies can you recommend Brisket of beef Czech style Dumplings and steak salad Dumplings and steak salad Brisket of beef Czech style You mean with horseradish But it is possible too that I am not yet ready to make a decision Is it true that one of your daughter's eyes is weak She has glaucoma She has glaucoma the child does she'll have to have an operation The doctor said she would have to have an operation You have to operate for glaucoma But she's a great help to you your daughter in the kitchen isn't she I guess so A pretty child a pity that she has glaucoma Draw the curtain Open it Go and stand behind the curtain I want to see the effect when you stand behind the curtain and the curtain opens We didn't even rehearse the curtain in Gaspoltshofen Yes see how easy it is not jerkily like Mattighofen slow but not too slow Close it and draw it again Well done Close it Open it How would it be if Lady Churchill picked her nose when the curtain opens I'm not joking Because you were picking your nose my child it was only an idea a silly idea it's true it's true a silly idea We have all sorts of ideas but they are mostly silly Close the curtain again Open it again a bit faster than before but not too fast You think I don't notice you sticking your tongue out at me A cheap effect to annoy your father I shall ignore it All right close the curtain again so I don't have to see this ugly child any longer Römerquelle Ordinary water tap water here in Utzbach here where everything is contaminated where everything is an open sewer mineral water sealed mineral water And you take it upon yourself to give your father ordinary and what's more brackish Utzbach water What an impertinence Ferruccio listen carefully you must drive to Gaspoltshofen and bring me Römerquelle They had Römerquelle in Gaspoltshofen Now go along Meanwhile Sarah and I will rehearse the encounter between Metternich and Napoleon on Zanzibar Go on How lovely my child to be alone with you when these terrible people are all away I'm worried about my heart my child it's been worrying me all this time Your mother insists that she suffers with her heart but I really do When we finally get to Rouen you shall have the evening gown that you want Rouen a culmination Just between the two of us I am a classic writer soon what has been our secret up to now will be known to the whole world My God what is Goethe my child Do you realise that I worked for eight months on the Metternich scene alone Agatha never understood why I basically locked myself up in my room for eight months denied myself to her for that time Eight months for the Metternich scene alone High art is a terrible ordeal my child What's the meaning of this Where did you get those bottles From the landlord's wife From the landlord's wife Nonsense From the landlord's wife What impudence bringing me ordinary water when they had Römerquelle here What bliss I think there's a thunderstorm brewing Römerquelle the truth is I hate mineral water It's delicious but I hate mineral water I sacrificed my passion for alcohol to high art not a drop of wine for thirty years hardly a glass of beer Crazy if not insane a completely senseless renunciation High art or alcoholism I've chosen high art You'll pay for it my child bringing me lukewarm Utzbach sewer water when there was Römerquelle to be had here I could even go so far as to say it's champagne go and practice your monologue You are the very weakest point in my comedy Get out of my sight How lovely to be alone with you at last when all those who make us despair bring us to the edge of madness have gone to hell My daughter grows more and more like her mother I see it quite clearly more and more like her I've always been afraid of that we've nothing to laugh about stand over there Yes there It always bothers me when you bow too low when Napoleon enters after all you are the King of Saxony don't forget that All right please do the bow Yes Bow yes but not obsequiously royally more or less Very good quite excellent Today we'll play Verdi between acts have you checked the equipment Verdi not Mozart Mozart here in Utzbach that would be insipid Enough I hate this music I hate music altogether in the theatre if it isn't opera But people have to have music between acts there's nothing else for it very good carry on bad music Verdi well what do you expect I can't even stand Mozart anymore Turn it off People don't even know what they are listening to it just has to be music it doesn't matter what it is people's stupidity has reached the point where they can't be without music for even a minute Music used to interest me it doesn't any more I am more interested in silence and in the art of words naturally and in the silence in between that's it These antlers these pictures must all go The walls must be bare the walls must be bare I have always insisted on playing between bare walls The lack of taste in the country is without parallel I didn't pay rent for the hall in Gaspoltshofen Here I'm supposed to pay rent this disgusting landlord this disgusting landlord's wife The landlord has a wicked case of halitosis A nightmare Lorrach will fall And you speak of coal from the Ruhr Mr. President Before swine In the country every intellectual product is cast before swine I wouldn't even want to be buried in the country And yet people find it irresistible this hypocritical society A certain theatrical talent even as a child At seventeen began to be interested in classical literature in earnest thirsty for the spiritual for the creative and all these tasteless landscapes and portraits except for the very last one there do you see that one Not this one Not that one That's Hitler can't you see Hitler You think that's Hitler Don't you think so I don't know It's Hitler All the male portraits here are of Hitler all men here are Hitler I think we should keep the picture there as a visual aid so to speak do you understand everyone here is Hitler Even back then the first steps so to speak into the world of the spirit at fifteen into the spiritual world of the drama We mustn't turn tail never turn tail Revenge on you prince Very bad ham ham depressingly bad Disastrous relations between you and the House of Rohan I should have left that out I've shown myself up unbelievably bad Suddenly in our declining years we relapse into dilettantism Your Majesty how cruel but naturally the people always end up as the worst of fools No strength left In Gaspoltshofen I spoke every line with such ease I find it hard here every word like granite forces everything to the ground impossible to think Did you really pack my linen cap I couldn't find it In your coat pocket In my coat pocket Yes that’s it As far as art is concerned we have never needed the female sex on the contrary they always prevent us from blossoming Where might we be today without them The whole time I pretended to myself that a tour like this was something it is nothing but depression People say that women are advancing today sure they are advancing toward disaster Soon the female will have to declare bankruptcy Can you imagine discussing Schopenhauer with your mother We have never been able to Complete birdbrains or Montaigne When they don't understand they turn it all into a joke The linen cap sticks to my head as though I glued it on no effect completely ineffective Recalcitrance If it were that easy She drinks peppermint tea has her feet rubbed with camomile Dares to contradict me about Metternich Refused to polish my shoes in Gaspoltshofen Come here Only an educated human being is a human being that is in my understanding not in everyone's why don't you read what I give you to read why don't you think what ought to be thought Swear to me that from this day on you will read what I order you to that you will think what I tell you to I'm in earnest about you in earnest and caring This place of horror is a place for swearing oaths Will you swear it Swear Schopenhauer Spinoza Oh never mind it's all pointless I made you swear once before in Osnabruck and nothing came of it Up the ladder yes to the windows yes chauffeuring You idiot handyman Go on get on with it I wanted a genius and I have a good man Nothing is more dangerous than good people Curtain puller string-puller of stupidity Almost nothing of me in this person Pay rent for the hall Do they think I'm crazy Two hundred and thirty inhabitants won't even cover expenses But things have been worse In Merano there weren't even three people only a cripple wheeled to the front by the cloakroom attendant The only time we cancelled Rent for the hall In Gaspoltshofen we could have done another performance Booked into Utzbach crazy If I myself in person What do you think if I myself go and see the fire chief about the emergency exit light No point trifling with the authorities something quite trivial can end up an affair of state I'm too old for that and too feeble to take on the government What do you think should I go Don't get involved with the government that's what your grandfather always said That disgusting person Well what's happened what's happened about the exit light what does the fire chief say What does he say the fire chief He's not at home Nonsense He's just pretending to be out You're probably in cahoots with the fire chief Not at home where is he supposed to be around here where can he have gone He's driven to Gallspach Why not say so Why didn't you say straightaway he's gone to Gallspach When will he be back At six If he comes back at six go to him at six and tell him I insist the emergency exit light be extinguished in the last scene Behold mankind annihilated The crucial sentence before it is totally dark Lady Churchill leaves her husband Winston and Stalin retracts his signature then it must be perfectly dark do you understand And something else your daughter only stirred up dust she didn't clean these window sills there lies the dust of ages Bring a bucket of hot water we'll scrub it ourselves we aren't fussy where there's dust it's simply impossible to speak Now go we're busy with our dramaturgy at the moment We underestimate the stupidity of these people we think they understand because we understand Wrong they don't understand anything Take it out take all that trash out out with it It would be better to give an evening of violin a small violin under one's arm nothing else musicians have hit the jackpot Acting is a lot of trouble everything about it repulsive just a violin we don't even need a woman for that only a good ear and a certain manual dexterity But the simple has never attracted me Always lived by swimming against the stream by the mechanism of counteraction just a violin That should be woman's work woman's work absolutely But they shirk it Lying in bed indulging in dolce far niente pondering imaginary problems feet sticking in a camomile brew lolling at the window Today your mother has a cough tomorrow a sore throat the day after tomorrow a cough again etcetera sickness fetishism Come here come here You must clean here here here here It's the exasperation that's important it's not our job to do people favours The theatre is not in the business of granting favours When Metternich enters there's no reason Lady Churchill shouldn't still have her hat on it doesn't fall off her head until she has sat down Sarah has done that quite well before But she puts it on again immediately Metternich is embarrassed because of course he's thinking of Czar Nicholas Metternich helps her on with it You are always a bit too slow at that point on the one hand too slow on the other too hasty when he's thinking of Czar Nicholas and at the same time wanting to do a favour for Lady Churchill in whom as we know he isn't really interested he mustn't bow abruptly do you understand After all he is already Prince Metternich naturally there's still something Coblenzian about him The hatpin is lying in front of the screen about there Here About there We mustn't leave anything to intuition We plan to the last detail yet always have to start from scratch there Yes there He acts as though he didn't know where the hatpin is lying everybody in the world can see the hatpin but he doesn't see it pretends to Lady Churchill that he doesn't see it of course Metternich is already thinking about Einstein's entry That's another way I could have ruined my comedy having Einstein enter at just this moment Metternich doesn't know where the hatpin is lying he is afraid of Einstein in a way the Czar has informed him about a certain Dordiyayev's contrivance but he cleverly ignores it The moment Lady Churchill bends down I start to dim the lights Green light on Metternich while I am in the process of making myself into Napoleon Over there Where Over there We ought to have spiked it with chalk But of course there isn’t even any chalk in these provincial holes Anyway I dim the light when you are both on the ground That's too far We don't gain anything that way that way Lady Churchill's features appear too pale The screen must come back Stop stop stop That's good Metternich is much freer in his movements that way Metternich's diction is not hurried it's more stately and of course in view of the fact Lady Churchill knows that the Czar has sent this dispatch to Napoleon his disposition is downright ideal At first I thought your mother could play Madame Curie but that didn't work To be sure Sarah is not ideal for the part either everything is a matter of compromise even when we have our eye on absolute perfection everything is matter of compromise intrigue you know nothing but intrigue Humanity caught in a trap Could you do me a favour this sentence in which Napoleon's character is most clearly seen say it aloud I think that's absolutely necessary Ferruccio It's a trifle for you but it will set my mind at rest to hear this sentence Ah well in the final analysis everything is a matter of compromise Standing No sitting sitting of course It is the what has been the continuing what has been from there on please now We certainly did not negotiate without these documents No I said from the what has been the continuing what has been onwards Continuing the what has been The other way round Ferruccio the other way round The what has been the continuing what has been Idiot I said from there on didn't I From there on From there on All right from there on With head held high naturally With head held high naturally For God's sake that's not in my comedy I just told you didn't I It is autumn Ferruccio don't forget harvest time but the audience must not notice that At least not in Madrid where the scene is set opening of the Prado you understand Retiro Park Variations in the background You have to know that on the one hand and totally ignore it on the other do you understand what I mean Your experience comes so to speak from Germany just think of Schopenhauer's Parerga Nietzsche effect that's what I intended by having Lady Churchill lose her hat at the very moment that Metternich enters Is everything clear Well now It is the what has been the continuing what has been You must say that with much more meaning as if you were saying the Pope is coming to tea at four o'clock as if the Pope had announced his visit at short notice It is the what has been It is the what has been the continuing what has been It is the what has been the continuing what has been No no The hatpin has already fallen when you say that not the hatpin I mean the hat the hat has already fallen Metternich has already sat down he is already seated then he says it is the what has been the continuing what has been It is the what has been the continuing what has been That is precisely what you should have read Spinoza for you have not read one word I’m embarrassed to observe that every time You would have saved us a lot of annoyance if you had read Spinoza then we could now dispense with this pedestrian discussion All right the what has been It is the what has been No no never mind It'll come to nothing rather it will make everything worse perhaps it's over-rehearsed as well on the other hand we cannot allow things to go to rack and ruin Last night I ran through the salutation scene once more with your mother no improvement there either this sultry weather is no good for acting There's the thunder already can you hear it At least it will cool things off a thunderstorm The salutation scene proceeds from the thought about Spinoza that's a Schopenhauerian trick I might almost say a Brusconian trick Sometimes I think I am Schopenhauer Bruscon is Schopenhauer Schopenhauer is Bruscon Metempsychosis spiritual homosexuality I think Naturally the hatpin comes loose first then the hat falls off first the hatpin then the falling off of the hat If you please do it all again It is the what has been the continuing what has been I don't like any of it What if we left those two sentences out altogether Then you would simply say Listen Metternich the danger is over That's better substantial improvement Ferruccio Now The what has been No leave it out I said Leave it out Leave out the what has been Listen Metternich the danger is over Excellent We'll leave out the what has been etcetera and you start with listen All right once more Listen Metternich That will do The idea was after all to write a comedy which encompassed all the other comedies that had ever been written Doubtless an absurd idea But quite within Bruscon's power to accomplish worst acoustics imaginable Here I shall murder what I have written with malice aforethought but my comedy will stand up even in the most adverse circumstances People will have to hear what is said but they mustn't hear too much the people will have to see what is shown them but not see too much as in all great dramatic literature the word is the lifeblood of my comedy After tonight I shall not be able to move anymore How healthy I was when we left Gaspoltshofen as if Utzbach were to be the death of me If we are bad pupils we become great masters that's what your grandfather my father always used to say on the distaff side naturally In my Wheel of History it is the word that counts The reviewers are resorting to empty-headed watching nowadays they don't listen any more We give our all but it is not understood the more we beggar ourselves the greater our mental exertion the less understanding the criticism all our lives we perform and not a soul understands us Lifelong incarceration in the theatre without the least chance of parole And yet we never gave up Penitentiary as theatre Tens of thousands of inmates none of whom with a prospect of parole The death sentence is their only certainty If only I could draw beer I thought white sleeves rolled up like a landlord and draw beer being happy Really I once wanted to be an innkeeper But I became an actor went voluntarily to the penitentiary a life sentence Nationally recognised actor touring company In one way I've always hated the box-seat theatre the box-seat crowd Why are you sitting there I don't need you not now so be gone Talentless brood No question of paying rent for the hall Paid a hundred and ninety schillings for the evening meal in Ried-im-Innkreis As long as we don't fall through here Everything rotten and decayed actually I should demand danger money for performing here When we go on tour I thought it will be a process of renewal for the theatre Always did completely oppositional theatre Actually we are indentured all our lives to the absurdity of having been born Fateful world design Error-ridden existence cacophonic idiotistic Perhaps it isn't all that good my comedy world made up of doubt Squandered decades perhaps Sudden loss of hearing I thought this morning from the cortisone pills In the middle of the comedy my hearing went but no break in the action distilled Chinese decoctions into it no better today No rent for the hall free room and board in Gaspoltshofen the doctor treated my ear as well Even if I were completely deaf I could finish performing my comedy Blindness that would be bad deafness only half as bad Chinese decoctions in my ear Nero Metternich Hitler historic constellation Churchill the link Stockings hand knitted by the landlord's wife in Gaspoltshofen friendly very friendly people stroke of luck Oh so it's you Sneaking landlord so to speak A little attack of weakness doubtless nothing unusual at my age a little Memorising a few lines etcetera Well The fire chief sends word that the emergency exit light can be extinguished Can be extinguished Yes of course It would be ridiculous if the people in Utzbach insisted on a restriction no other place insisted on the most ridiculous restriction possible Of course I thought the exit light will be extinguished I only drink mineral water a man of the spirit can do nothing else In every village I inquire whether the cemetery is soggy is the cemetery here dry The cemetery is wet through and through Why actually in a dry cemetery a saturated one is more or less ideal Decomposition conducive It was not my idea to come to this Utzbach Not under four hundred inhabitants I said Agatha's greed I sensed it Perhaps I shall cut the third act seventeenth scene nineteenth scene the Churchill scene in Utzbach the whole comedy doesn't have to be performed Before swine But the instinct of self-preservation is at stake Chinese decoctions didn't want to take a fee Signed copy of the comedy There are still decent people in the country Gaspoltshofen was a complete success Humanity is still at home in the Lower Alps In the Alps they are all rotten to the core tourism has destroyed them Seven o'clock Deprived of the tension in the last analysis No restriction on the emergency exit light any more Actors leading actors Thought about you to no avail No appreciation of art My fault My megalomania My crime Just as in Gaspoltshofen cut the nineteenth scene seventeenth scene the Churchill scene the whole third act It is time for you to hang the curtains Your hacking will only delight the hacks The house is filling up Remarkably short people remarkably short and fat I have nothing against these holes in the wall Where there's a will there's a way You haven't polished my shoes give them a rub quickly Don't turn tail Never turn tail But you're hurting me polish not crush Desolation For my part I'm not really averse to these desolate places yes I often say to myself the more desolate the better It doesn't matter where you look no prospects Only because we believe in ourselves do we manage to endure it do we survive what we cannot change because we believe in our art If we did not have that faith and even if it's only in the art of acting we should have long since been in the cemetery Nothing interests us but our art nothing more Possessed with tomfoolery shameless in a certain sense Stop at nothing of course Ne'er-do-wells in a certain sense incorrigible In this way we escape from the tawdriness of national theatres Never play in a national theatre again How I hate the words box seat About two hundred can stand here at the back of the house Eight hundred and thirty in the audience in Gaspoltshofen But we know Utzbach has only just over two hundred inhabitants My comedy is written so even the last person in the last row can catch everything my comedy is high art no arcane nonsense in a certain way I am a fanatic for the truth Madame Curie was a Pole don't forget that I don't care for the Polish people not unconditionally attention-getters bigotry the Catholic sort insipid but I have always loved Madame Curie you don't play her as someone I could love but I'm not going to let you alienate me from Madame Curie historic figure absolutely magnificent historic figure Careless make-up Madame Curie especially can take a lot of black eye shadow All right what are you waiting for bring me the make-up box More black round the eyes I know you like to avoid black make-up It's revolting to have to add black make-up to your face every time That cough imaginary hypochondriacal Atomic age my dear the whole atomic age must be in this face More or less the end of the world in your face Madame Curie must have a completely black face is what I've always said I can't understand why you don't do as I tell you You spend too much time in bed We've hardly arrived before you crawl into bed while I have to do all the work Unhappy disposition wife Your hair is much too loose Combed back severely I've told you repeatedly leave it dishevelled combed back quite severely a la polonaise Polish women have their hair combed back all Polish women severely combed Madame Curie was ugly I know you would like to cut a beautiful figure on the stage but then you mustn't play Madame Curie I don't have a Madame Pompadour in my play There is no courtesan in my play After all it isn't a lewd play it is a classical one If I could only breathe some life into you but it's no good you're just as stiff as when I first met you I could break the spell I thought breathe life into you What a mistake But Madame Curie was also a stiff person an eccentric Pole completely stiff ultimately just as uninspired as you that's the truth boring in the extreme as history shows Polish through and through Only she split the atom and you just exasperate us with your cough His Honour the mayor is already there A school group Half price but at any rate they're interested there is certainly interest In Gaspoltshofen they had two hundred posters printed here there aren't even twenty handwritten ones clumsy lettering hair-raising copy Bruscon is my name I said to the landlord not Buscon as it is on the posters and The Wheel of History is spelt with a "wh" not just a "w" But I'd be telling a lie if I were to maintain that in Gaspoltshofen they understood my comedy The people were not restrained in their applause Still this all-pervasive stench of pigsties Strangely misshapen people Most interesting forms of deformation A paralytic in a paralytic's conveyance remarkable We cannot turn back the wheel of history that's what I said to the mayor A historical diatribe that's what my comedy is I said to the mayor Revolutionary in a certain sense master punster who doesn't despise a cheap joke either The house is filling up Theatregoers from surrounding areas too Certainly looks like it People striving for culture More of a caricature of Metternich bad make-up job extraordinarily bad posture I could almost say looks like Metternich really a resemblance to Metternich Not such a slack face at odds with Metternich's spirit Metternich is the greatest underestimated like no one else and hated Elegant bearing Elegance after all does not detract from intelligence that would be absurd elegance quite on the contrary underscores intelligence Intelligence is elegance A small supper I think light fare in this sultry weather It would have been sheer lunacy here in in in Utzbach In Utzbach to play Mozart between acts Verdi will do just as well just as well Verdi will do Italianita Italianita As if this were to be the death of me Butchers have quite a beautiful relationship to dramatic art Since in Gaspoltshofen I ate duck today I feel like a nice piece of stuffed roast veal The best actors have to eat meat every day Vegetarianism does not agree with the art of acting You are the only one who thinks it's possible to survive in the long run on vegetables and ghastly salads Look at you A disgrace to the theatre a disgrace to the feminine gender Bricklayer's daughter My proletarian my favourite proletarian How dare you Sarah my child our mother is a mad woman The hall is filling up Twenty past seven Almost a hundred people But it is a fact that almost all my life I have suffered from having to be an actor If we don't indulge ourselves we get nowhere possibly I am a megalomaniac like my play or perhaps not But when people understand my comedy then I don't feel like performing it any more The advantage we have is that we accuse no one only ourselves lifelong need for self-accusation Shakespeare Goethe Bruscon that's the truth Fear of freezing to death Creature comforts have always been odious to us We preach and they don't comprehend Philosophical through and through my child The parsonage is on fire the parsonage is on fire on fire The hall is empty an empty hall perfectly empty My dear father I might have known it would come to this Subtitles by: ausmanx
