Hello, Miss Simmons. - Hello. - Hi, Mary. Hello, Mr. Haskell. Here's your shirts, Jimmy. I turned the cuffs. Oh, thanks very much. It's little enough for letting Mary come here and practice every day. Ah, it's all right. How's she doing? Ah, just don't you discourage her. She keeps up this practice and she'll be able to play real good. I'll be back in an hour. Okay, I'll take good care of her. All right, hop to it, Mary. Mary uh, gimme an A, will ya. That's it. Okay, thanks. Hey, Jimmy, when you going to get some new records? Well, you kids haven't quite worn out the old ones, yet. Won't be long, now. Hi, Tommy. Here's some eggs for my last lesson, Jimmy. Tomorrow, I'll bring the bacon. Okay, here's your horn. I think you left your music over there some place. Well, Uncle Charlie, hello. Glad to see you. Hello, Jimmy, I'm glad to see you, too. Well, this is quite a surprise. What brings you up in this neck of the woods? Well, I came up to see you, since you didn't take the trouble to answer my letter. Letter? Oh, well, I wanted a little time to think it over. Well, come on in, Uncle Charlie. I, I, I wrote you. I wrote you three months ago. Oh, is it that long? I don't know, you know how it is, a fellow gets busy and everything. Now these, these things in dry weather, you have to change the oil every thousand miles on it. Now that does it. Jimmy? Jimmy! I came up to have an important talk with you. Go ahead, go ahead, I'm listening. Go ahead. Can't we go some place without this infernal racket? Oh, oh, yeah. We'll go right in my room, there. Where? Right, right over there. Oh! Here we are. Oh, not that chair, Uncle Charlie. That needs a little fixin' I took it in on a trade for a second-hand clarinet. Jimmy, I'm not gonna beat around the bush. As you know, you and I have not been very close. After all, we are the last of the Haskells. Oh, is that very serious? It is to me. I want to keep the name of Haskell in the health-food business. Yeah, well, I understand how you feel, Uncle Charlie. I wanna keep the name of Haskell in the music business. I'm talking about big business. Can't you understand? I need you, Jimmy. Someday, you're going to get everything I've got. But you're not going to get it if you persist in frittering your life away in this town, this whistle stop. I like it here. My dad was happy here. Oh, I could never understand my brother. And I told him when he opened this place he'd never make a go of it. Well, he kept it fairly successfully for 25 years, that's not bad. If he'd listened to me, he'd been a rich man. But, no. So what did he have when he died? The biggest funeral this town ever saw. Everybody was there. Why not? Everybody owed him money. Maybe so. Dad just had a wonderful time living. He liked things. He liked to hunt and fish. He liked music. Music! Yeah he, he talked a great deal about you. - He did? - Mm-hmm. Always seemed to feel so sorry for you. Sorry for me? You didn't get anything out of life, just making money. Is that so? Since when has making money been a crime? Since when? Oh, I'm not going to argue with you. And I'm not going to let myself be upset! No sir! Jimmy! Jimmy! Uncle, I'm sorry. Oh, don't hit him, Jimmy, he's an old man. Oh, no, it was just the chair, you see? Are you hurt, Uncle Charlie? Oh, don't mind me. Oh, hello, Bud. Can I talk to you for a minute? Oh, yeah, well, outside here. Will you excuse me a minute, Uncle Charlie? Afraid I've got some bad news for you, Jimmy. Well, what's the trouble, Bud? I'm suppose to tack up this attachment unless you can dig up some money. Oh. Well, I guess you have to tack it up. Unless you think eggs are gonna go up to $500 a dozen all of a sudden. Well, see what you can do. I'll hold this off as long as I can. Okay, thanks, Buddy. Oh, that was uh, uh, he was just tellin' me about some people that wanted some musical instruments. He's the sheriff, isn't he? How'd you know? I knew his father. He was serving a paper on your father the first time I came up here. That's right. Well, Jimmy, what's it gonna be? You can stay here chasing rainbows or you can come with me. I can show you a real pot o' gold that's yours for the taking. Well, I, I.. Wait a minute. That's a good idea for my radio program tomorrow night. You've heard my "Happiness Hour," of course? Oh, yes, everybody's heard that. Once. Listen to this. The clouds that make the day so gray must sooner or later pass away. There's always a pot o' gold at the end of the rainbow. Good ol' homespun philosophy. Oh, boy. Well, I've got to be going. What are you going to do? Well, I'll tell ya, Uncle Charlie, I, unless a miracle happens in the next few days, looks like I'll slide down that rainbow. Fine. Land right in the pot. Uh, what, what was I saying? And furthermore.. And furthermore, I see no reason to change the old.. What was I saying? And furthermore.. And furthermore, I see no reason for changing the air guns we are now using to puff our rice and other cereals. Our present air guns are exceptionally quiet in operation. I therefore would suggest that.. There goes that band again. Oh, I'll fix this. How can a man transact any business with that going on day after day? Tom-toms, jungle screeches, they're a menace to sanity. What did I say? Tom-toms and jungle screeches. No, no, but that's what I mean. The McCorkles took that band in their house just to annoy me. That's why they've ignored all of my protests. Well, I understand it's a new band just organized. Who wants a new band? Let 'em organize in a cave somewhere. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom! I'll settle this once and for all. Hey! Hey, you! Hey! Hey, you! Hey, somebody, hey! Hey, hey! What's the matter? Stop that, that blasted bedlam or I'll have it stopped! Oh, you will, eh? Ha, you and who else? The police. I'll have that gang of noisy loafers thrown in jail for disturbing the peace! Disturbin' the peace, are we? What about that air gun of yours, boomin' all day and night? I suppose that's a baby's lullaby, you white-headed old baboon. That boomin' is business. And besides, we're all used to it. The band is business. And you'll get used to it too or it's your own hard luck. I'll get out an injunction. Oh, you will, 'eh? Well, listen, you black-hearted old skinflint. For years, you've tried every trick to make me sell my house here, so you could enlarge your factory. Well, I'm not sellin' Haskell, not at your price. So go ahead, call the cops if you think you can have this band thrown outta here. You just wait, you'll find out. Go ahead, boys, go to it, but loud. Jasper! Go get Jasper. Jasper! Jasper! Go get him, find him, don't stand there like a dummy. Do I have to do everything myself around here? Jasper! Jasper! Do you want me, CJ? Do I want you? Why aren't you here when I need you? Go get the police. The police, CJ? The militia, if necessary. That McCorkle woman has insulted me for the last time. But you've said that before, CJ. I know, but this time I mean it. That band is driving me insane. It certainly is. Well, have 'em arrested. I will.

No, that'll be all, thank you. Here, stupid. Well, take it. Thank you. Come on. Too bad you can't carry a few bundles without complaining. Oh, I don't mind carrying them. Well, who are you? I'm the guy carrying the bundles. Well, thanks. I thought my brother Willie was behind me. Oh, no, no he went ahead of you. Oh, I'm terribly sorry. You must've been surprised. No, no, I guess life in the big city's just one big surprise after the other. For instance? Well, for instance, band music comin' down outta the sky in broad daylight. Oh, that. That's up on our roof. On your roof, is it? The band is strictly on the house. Until we get a job. Oh, well, you with the band? Well, my sister Donna and I sing with it. My brother plays in it but Mother feeds it. Oh, well it certainly is a swell band all right. There's a slight difference of opinion around here about that. Oh, you mean the neighbors object? Oh, no, the neighbors are all.. Uh-oh, here comes trouble. Well, Miss McCorkle, as you can see, I'm here with the law. For protection, huh? Certainly not. We are here to give you the last warning. That music must cease, definitely once and for all. I'm comin' Molly. What does this weasel want this time? As if I didn't know. No violence, now. Speak to her, officer. Hello, Mom. You've been in bad company, Mac. Well, I've been sent to deliver an ultimatum. Oh, ye have, have ye? Yes, and this band must go. They're disturbing the peace of the entire neighborhood. Oh, the entire neighborhood? Does it disturb you, Mrs. Poppadolis? Not-a me, it-a keeps me young. Disturbin' the peace. What about you, Mrs. Sweeney? It's a big advantage to me. My old man can't fight when he hears music. They will, will they? The hoodlums, they're ruffians. Now, go back to your kennel and tell Old Man Haskell what you've heard. Go on now. Hey! Hey! Hey, what's goin' on here? You've heard about the feud between the Hatfields and the McCoys, haven't you? Yeah. Well, this is the one between the McCorkles and the Haskells. What'd you say? Who? Come on. Officer, do something! Hey, what are you doing? I'm looking for a nice soft one. Oh, quit kicking me, quit kicking me! Look out. Now, just a minute, just a minute. You might miss him. - Ow! Ow! Down. Oh, you hoodlums, you'll pay for this, you hoodlums. Now! Stand aside, Jasper. Gosh, I hit the wrong man. Oh, no you didn't. You hit the right man. Run! Well, wait, the.. Come on! Oh, my gosh. Oh, it's blood. I've been shot, I've been stabbed! You're all right, CJ, take it easy. No, I'm not all right. Call a doctor, call an ambulance. But that isn't blood, CJ. It isn't blood? Well, what is it, what is it? Tomato juice. Somebody hit you with a tomato. All's clear, come on in. Whew. Boy, you sure do know your backyards and fences. Oh, I'd have made better time yet if I hadn't had to wait for you. Well, I didn't wanna ask you to carry my suitcase. Have a doughnut, hero, the best I can offer. Well, thanks. Hero? Me? You certainly are. You know, I wouldn't be surprised if they put up a statue of you throwing that tomato. You know, like the discus fellow? Oh, well, that was an accident. Hitting my, uh, that man. Accident? That was a stroke of genius. If you only knew how everybody hates Old Man Haskell. They do, why? Why? I could give you a reason for every dollar he's got in the bank. Do you know that he tried to drive us out of our home because he doesn't like music? He's sort of a stinker, isn't he? And how. Believe me, the name of Haskell's pure poison around here. It is? Well. Guess I better be going. Oh, what's your hurry? Well, I have to find a place to live. I sort of expected to live with a relative of mine, but it doesn't seem like a very good idea now. Well, if you'd like a place where there's never a dull moment, what's the matter with this? - Well, I didn't know.. - Molly, are ye going? What's goin' on here? Who are you and what do you want? Mom, he's looking for a place to live. Oh, are you a new member of the band or will you be livin' here on a cash basis? Mom, this is the fellow that hit Old Man Haskell with a tomato. Oh, glory be. Oh, you darlin' Why didn't you tell me? So, you're the fellow? Now, listen young man. You're not lookin' any further. You're gonna live right here with us. Here, give me the bag. Well, that's very nice of you but.. There'll be no buts now. Why the best room in the house is none too good for you, whether you can pay for it or not. Come on now, gimme the bag. - Well, well here, I'll.. You're not leavin' this house. - I'll take the bag. Willie! Willie, where are you? Hey, Molly, been lookin' for you. I have that arrangement finished. Oh, fine. Can we try it? - Right now. I want you to take this bag up to the big room. Can't anybody besides me ever carry anything?

Grady! Oh, Molly, darling. Grady's been pounding the beat out by the garbage dumps. A little argument with Old Man Haskell. Grady, you should have been here a little while ago, you'd have been even for life. Yeah, what happened? Oh, boy, plenty. It's what they call it poetic justice. It must have been good. Good? It was perfect. Well, come on, come on, out with it. Well, Old Man Haskell came steaming over here. Yeah? And he got hit with a tomato. Right in the kisser. It was a soft one, naturally. The hit and run kind. Oh, boy. Nobody knows who did it, I hope. No, nobody but me. But I'm big-hearted. Boys, meet the sharp-shooter. Lemme shake the hand of the man Molly McCorkle, will you never learn to keep your big mouth shut? What did I say? Too much. Open up, boys, open up, open up. Open up. My boy, you should have a medal. Yes, sir, I'm sorry I can't be giving you one instead of this. Oh, thanks very much. What is it? It's a warrant for assault and battery. Old Man Haskell swore it out. Mm-hmm. - Come on, son. - Hm? Wait. Wait a minute. Grady. Wouldn't you like to give me a good swift kick before you go? Oh, no, that's all right. This has been fun, here. And I enjoyed jumpin' over those fences with you. If I ever get this thing straightened out, I hope you'll let me come back some time. And uh, oh, thanks for that doughnut. That was all right. Eh, well, come on Grady. - Oh, yes, yes. - Yeah. The next case. Hold everything, judge, we'll be right there. Molly, where are you? Come on, hurry up, the case has started. Order, order in the courtroom. Mary McCorkle, sit down. Now listen, Mike, don't you be gettin' on your high horse with me. Sit down. Now what's this case all about? Young man, what's your name? My name? I'd prefer your real name. Uh-huh. Uh, oh, my name is James Hamilton. James Hamilton? Yeah, put that down. And where do you live, James Hamilton? He lives with us at my house. 41963rd Street. Now, tell me, James, how did you get enmeshed in the coils of the law? I threw a tomato. He's too modest, Mike. He made a bulls-eye right in Old Man Haskell's face. He did? Uh, where were we? I'd just thrown the tomato, your honor. Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes. And now tell me, Jimmy, my boy, did you with premeditation and intent, deliberately aim at the aforesaid Haskell's face? Well.. And the defendant refuses to answer on the grounds that he might incriminate himself. Glory be, Mike, you certainly know the law. Having weighed the evidence, the court rules that the case be postponed and the defendant release on bail. Provided anybody has any money. We have $200. Is that enough? That was the exact sum that the court had in mind. Who has it? I have it, your honor. The clerk will accept it. Next case. Thank you, Mike. Stand aside, please. Will you move over? All right, who ya pushin'? I'm not pushing you. - Take it easy, will ya? - Hey, wait a minute. Don't you push me. Here comes double pneumonia. Open the windows, boys, I smell stale tomatoes. Very funny, Mrs. McCorkle, very funny. I only wish it had been you that threw that tomato. So do I, only I'd-a put a rock in it. Oh, you would? Well let me tell.. Proceed with the case, judge. I'm here. Where's the man that assaulted me? If you don't mind, I'll conduct this case without any advice from you. That's tellin' him, Mike. Move along, in you go. All right, take it away, Eddie. I bring a legitimate charge against a hoodlum. And before I can give my evidence, the thug is permitted to walk out right under your nose. In the first place, he wasn't under my nose. And in the second place, the defendant was released on bail. And the third place, you're in contempt of court, and I sentence you to 25 days or $25. Oh, that ain't enough, Mike. Quiet, quiet. This is an outrage. It's, it's a travesty on justice. $50 or 50 days. - What? - Make up your mind. It's worth 50 to tell you what I think. Is it worth a hundred? All right, but you wait until the next election. You wait until.. I'm waiting. Until the uh, your honor, it appears that I haven't any money with me. Take him away, bailiff. You can't do this to me! Court declares a recess. - You can't do this to me! - Come on. Come on. ♪ And he sang Lily ♪ ♪ By the moonlight ♪ Hold on, hold on.

Certainly, sir. This is my nephew, Mr. James Haskell. Oh. How do you do, sir? Same to you. Pardon me, is your luggage in the car, sir? Luggage? Oh, I just had one suitcase and I left that at.. What are you whispering about? I don't know, you started it, sir. I lost my voice singing. Singing? You, sir? Yes, I was.. I think I better go and get my suitcase. You won't need it, we have everything here. Come on. Well, here you are, my boy. This is all yours from now on. I'm so happy to have you with me at last. Well, thank you, sir. In case you need anything, it's right there. Well, that's fine. We'll have breakfast at 7:30, then I'll take you over to the factory and introduce you around. Uh-huh. Best of all, I'm going to put you on the payroll I don't imagine you've got much money. Well, your cashier cashed a check for me. Your personal check? How much? Oh, it was certified. $214, that's what was left when I closed up shop. Oh, well, that dismal episode is behind you forever, my boy. Tomorrow is another day. With more music by the McCorkles, probably. Jimmy, that old lady is deliberately trying to wreck my health. But why? Just because I want her property. Oh, that's very unreasonable. Yeah, it's getting on my nerves, I can't stand it any longer. Well, Uncle Charlie, why don't you go on a vacation? And let the McCorkles think that they're chasing me out of town? That's just what they want. Nothing is going to stand in the way of my getting the man who hit me with that tomato. This is my room if you want me. I'm going to take a hot bath and a hot toddy and go to bed. Goodnight, Jim.

Look, just what goes on between you and CJ Haskell? Oh, well, I might as well tell ya, he's my uncle. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. Well, here, I'll prove it to you. Here's a letter he sent me. To James Hamilton Haskell, that's me. Here, you wanna read it? No, I'd rather not. - Say, what is this? What are you doing here? Oh, well I almost forget what I came for. In the first place, there's $200. Now you can get your instruments outta hock. Did you get that from your uncle? You don't know my uncle. Thanks, Jim. That's all right, that's all right. I like the people in this house. 'Specially, well, I like everybody. I'd sorta like to live here all the time. But, soon as Molly finds out who I am, she'll kick me out in the alley, so I.. Well, suppose she doesn't find out. Well, that'd be very nice but.. Now, look, you've been regular. You didn't have to come across with that dough. I'm for you, Jimmy. How 'bout you, Horace? Sure thing, I'm for you. Well, thanks very much, I just. No, I, I still got troubles. Don't you see, sooner or later, Molly's gonna find out who I am. Just like sooner or later Old Man Haskell's gonna find out who threw that tomato. And it, it just won't work. Either way, I'm a dead duck. Look, how's your uncle gonna find out? Well, he'll see me at the trial, won't he? What would happen if Uncle Charlie didn't show up for the trial? They'd throw the case outta court. - Well, there's your answer. We get rid of Uncle Charlie. How? Well, we'll let Red run over him with the ice wagon. Oh, do you think he'd do it? Oh, you couldn't do that. What do you mean we couldn't do that? Red'd love it, I'll go get him. Oh, wait a minute, now hold on here. Couldn't you do somethin' not quite so drastic? Any ideas? Yeah, I think I better go back to Point Jervis. Uncle Charlie's a pretty tough guy to deal with. And from the way he talked tonight, you better find some place else to rehearse your band. Well, so long Horace. Well, so long, Jimmy. Sorry about this. And Willie, thanks for everything. - So long, Jimmy. - It's been very nice. - Jim, wait a minute. - What? That's it. The band, he doesn't like it. No, he certainly does not. What? Come on. - Come on, what're we doing? - Come on. Toot toot tee tee toot. Don't shoot, Bill! You get what's coming, you slut. Jimmy? Jimmy. Here he comes, do you think it'll work, Horace? If these whiskers don't fall off. Yeah. Yes, Uncle Charlie? Jimmy. What are you doin' down here? And who is this man? Well, I'll tell you, Uncle Charlie, I got worried about you, I couldn't sleep, so I called in a specialist. Now, this is Professor Heidt, this is my Uncle Charlie. Oh nonsense, I don't need a doctor, I eat my own health foods. It's my nerves that are cracking. - That's why I'm here, Mr. Haskell, to work on your nerves. Relax, please. Relax? How can anybody relax with that music going on? Music? Music? What music? That creepy music. Don't you hear it? You see what I mean, Professor? I tell you, I hear music. Maybe it's the radio in the library. It's not the radio. Do you still hear it, Uncle Charlie? Yes, it's still playing. Mr. Haskell, tell me, where does this music seem to be coming from? I don't know, but just a moment, I'll tell you. It's here, it's plainer down here. Da do dee da dum, da do dee da dum. Uncle Charlie, don't you think you better go back to bed? I tell you, Jimmy, I hear it. Here. Here, here it is. Da da da da. It, it's coming from the furnace. Music in furnace. Well, listen yourself. Jimmy, please tell him that you hear it. I'll get Parks, he'll get me out of this. Parks, he'll back me up, you see if he don't. What's the matter? There. Don't tell me you don't hear anything. Oh, yes. It's about time, I was beginning to get nervous. Beautiful string quartet. String quartet? It's bugles. Hears bugles on phone. I tell you, I hear bugles. It's bugles. Don't try to humor me. All right, now let's go and get some air. You've nothing to worry about until you start seeing things. There you go. - There's nothing wrong with me. Jimmy, look. Doctor, look. What do you see? What do you want us to see, Uncle? Girls, dancing on the lawn. Where? There. Sees paper dolls dancing on lawn. Paper dolls? You're right, Jimmy, I'm in terrible shape. My nerves are all gone. Doctor, what do you think I better do? Mr. Haskell, give your nerves a good, long rest. Get outta town. I'll do it. I'll go up in the woods. Fine, we'll help you pack. No. Not until I find the man who threw that tomato. Now, Uncle Charlie, your health is much more important than that silly tomato. Yes, Mr. Haskell, that's right. Sure, now let me handle this. I'll put the finger on that fella, he's as good as in jail right now. Almost. And while you're up there resting, he'll be well taken care of, don't worry about that. And I'm the guy that can do it. Good. I'll take the first train out in the morning. Oh! What's the matter now? The music stopped. All but the bull fiddle. Now you see, you're improving already. Yes. Hiya, Mr. Haskell, what can I do for you? Hello, Mr. Louderman. Well, I just dropped in to see if we couldn't make the "Haskell Happiness Hour" a little bit happier. Welcome, stranger, sit right down. What'll ya have to drink? Well, I.. Hello, Mr. Baccus. What's the purpose of this meeting? Well, we were about to discuss the program. You know very well that I have charge of the "Happiness Hour" during Mr. Haskell's absence. He trusts me implicitly. Well, not a hundred percent. I beg your pardon? Look, I have a note from my uncle giving me complete charge of the program, hm? Well, it didn't take you long to undermine me with your uncle, did it? Hm-mm. How do I know you didn't write that yourself? Now listen, Mr. Louderman, they'll be no change.. Would you excuse us a minute? - Certainly. - I wanna talk to you. Yes. We had better talk this over. Yeah, yeah, right. Be right back. I'd like to make some other improvements, too. Go right ahead. Well, I'd like to use a band. - Oh, no, no, please, no. We're overloaded with bands. No, but this is ideal, because my uncle hates it. What? Yeah, it drove him clear up to Canada. Well, then what do you wanna put it on his program, for? Well, it's pretty hard to explain, but you see it'll give the band a break. And then they'll have to thank my uncle for it and that'll make him feel pretty good. Up in Canada? - Up in Canada - Yeah, yeah. And there's sort of a feud going on. A feud? Uh-huh. And uh, then there's a girl. Oh, a girl. Yeah. Hm. Sounds pretty confusing, doesn't it? Well, no, it sounds pretty good. It does? Well, that's it, you play Thursday night over a coast-to-coast hookup at the opening of the Eastchester Country Club. That's great, Jim, how did you ever do it? Well, I don't know. I just started to talk, the fellow listened. I'm just as surprised about it as you are. How much do we get for it? Uh, nothing. Nothing? No, you don't get anything. Oh. Well, what of it? Is it any different than playing for the neighbors and Old Man Haskell? What do we get out of that? At least this way, there's a chance. I'm sold, what can we lose? That's all right for me. Hey, gimme a push. Bonsoir, monsieur. What did he say? Bonsoir, monsieur. And you made me drag this pack through the woods for four hours to get to a place where nobody can talk English. What kind of a guide are you, anyway? Hey, Pierre, have-ay-voo a machine, talkie-talkie? Uh, no, I don't think so. I've got a good one right there. I'm not a peddler, this one is busted. I want to hear a program in America that goes on at eight o'clock. Oh, help yourself. Here, get this avalanche off my back. Oui, monsieur. Oui, monsieur. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That's all right now. We're about to start our broadcast. Well, boys, here we go. Good luck. What, are you scared? Well, just take deep breath. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. The "Haskell Happiness Hour" comes to you tonight from the dining patio of the exclusive Eastchester Country Club. Country Club? What the.. This marks the first appearance on the air of a new band.. - Music? - Horace Heidt and His Musical Knights. - On my program? Thank you and good evening, ladies and gentlemen. This is Horace Heidt, and the first number on our program is "Broadway Caballero," featuring Miss Molly McCorkle. McCorkle!

Jimmy, that means we're a success. I've been double-crossed. Get me a drink. Bands! Country clubs! The McCorkles! Get me a drink, do you hear? And now, I want to tell you something. Well, it certainly took you long enough to get around to it. Eh, no, this is just something that's been worrying me. You don't know anything about me, who I am. Oh, as if that made any difference. You're you and I'm me. Well, I think I'd better tell you about this. - Oh, there you are. - Oh, go away. - Looks like you made quite an impression. Well, it'll be a different story when I tell your uncle about it. Believe me, CJ won't pay for your philandering. Is Haskell your uncle? Yes, now that's what I've been trying to tell you. If you'll just let me explain. I don't need any explanation, it's all perfectly obvious. Sneaking into our home, pretending that you wanted to help us and then making me feel for you so. Now wait a minute, will you please let me explain? What a cheap trick, you are a Haskell. Hey now, Molly, quiet, they can hear you out here. - Yeah, how 'bout that? - That's fine! Hello everybody. I have some good news for you. Every week beginning next Thursday, Mr. Haskell, the sponsor of our program, is going to give away $1,000 in cash to somebody. A thousand dollars a week! That's a lie! Isn't that generous, folks? Now, Mr. Haskell, trick your way out of that. I've gotta get back home. How long is it gonna take me to get outta here? Well, first portage take two days. How long it take it to get here? A week! With luck, you can make it back in a week. A week and, huh! Let's get started. Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy, my boy, congratulations. That was a marvelous idea. How did you come to think of it? Just came out of a clear sky. The "Haskell Happiness Hour" created nationwide interest in his program last night by announcing that $1,000 a week would be given away in cash. I know, I read all the papers. Here's Mr. Haskell. Morning. This is your uncle's attorney, Mr. Chalmers. Good morning. How you do, sir? I won't take much of your time. Just sign this paper, please. What is it? A statement that you did not authorize Miss McCorkle to make that announcement last night. That she did it out of spite with intent to damage your uncle. Now sign here, please. Oh, now, wait a minute. There's nothing to worry about. I'll guarantee we can get judgment against the McCorkles. They won't be able to pay, so we take their property. And that's what your uncle's been trying to do for years. Now sign here, please. It's a funny thing, I don't like to get pushed around. I also don't sign anything until I read it first. Now, how'd you like to get out of here, both of you. Don't you hit me again, I have my glasses. Oh, oh! Mr. Haskell, your uncle.. Good day, sir, good day. Beautiful, Parks. - Thank you, sir. - Yeah. Why don't you answer the phone? Hello. Oh, Jimmy me boy, how are ye? Oh, you want to talk to Molly? Well, I don't think it's a very good time to. Just a moment. You go and fight your own battles, I'm not doin' it for you. I don't wanna talk to him. Well? Look, I hate to annoy you, but this is important. Now that $1,000 offer you made last night, it was my idea, do you understand? Now, just don't argue. Anybody asks you anything about it, just follow Grady's advice. Don't you tell me to keep my mouth shut. Why should I? Well, if you don't, they'll take your home away from you. What is this another one of your tricks? I don't need any help from you. What? I said don't be stupid. I'm not doin' it for you, this is for mom and the boys. Oh! - Excuse me, sir, Mr. Louderman and Mr. Sampson are calling. Oh, have them come in. Yes, sir. Come in, please. Hello. Hello, Jimmy. Congratulations. Your program was a knockout. Telegrams, phone calls from all over the country. People, oh, I beg your pardon, this is Mr. Sampson. How do you do, Mr. Sampson. Yes, sir. Won't you sit down? Yes, thank you. Mr. Sampson is an investigator for the federal government. Oh, I see, the, well, what's the government got to do with it? We're only concerned with one detail, the method by which you will give away the money. Oh, I see. Well, that oughtn't to be very hard. I never heard of anybody having any trouble giving away a thousand dollars. Well, let's see.. You understand that it cannon be a lottery. The government wouldn't permit raffles or drawings of any description. Oh, oh, yes, I understand that. No, that would be.. Well, how 'bout a quiz contest? Well, no, I'm afraid not. It was announced that the money would be given away over the air, not to a studio audience. Oh, well that sort of complicates it, doesn't it? Let's see, well, uh. Well, how 'bout taking a city directory and sticking a pin in it and then give the thousand dollars to the fella that gets stuck? Oh, no, a city directory is local. This has become a national affair. Oh, well, let's call the whole thing off and not give away my uncle's money at all. No, no, that money was promised and must be given away. Yes, if it isn't, why my company loses its franchise. And your uncle's business is ruined. And you'll be liable to a fine and imprisonment. Well, that's great. Now, I have quite a choice, don't I? Either I give the money away and go to jail or I don't give the money away and go to jail. Hand me the salt. Still moonin' about Jimmy, huh? Well, believe me, you've seen the last of him. And he's probably glad he found out just what kind of a girl you really are. All right, Mom, all right. But it's not all right. A fine lad like Jimmy deserves a girl who really loves him. Whether his name be Hamilton or Haskell or Hasenpfeffer. Well, I hope you're satisfied. What's the matter now? Well, nobody can figure out how to give away that thousand dollars. It looks like Jimmy's going to jail on account of it. Oh, this is awful. But Jimmy isn't responsible. He didn't make the offer, I did. Well, he says it's his program and he's gonna take the rap for it. Well, are you going to stand by and see that boy go to jail? But Jimmy told me.. I know what he told you and why. To keep a roof over our heads. Well, I'd rather we'd lose our house than lose our pride. Oh, mom. I've been feeling the same way all week. Yes? No, not yet. Well, gentlemen, someone's got to think of something, somehow, and soon. It's tonight, you know, the program goes on the air. Not next month. And we're no closer to the answer than we were a week ago. Yes? I've got it. I got it this time, boy, it came to me just like that. - What is it? - Now look. We'll get that bowl. You know that great big glass bowl they used for the draft numbers? - Great, that's it. - Yeah. My boy, I'm proud of you. That'll do it. No, no, gentlemen, no, no. What's a matter? It would be a lottery, and the government forbids lotteries. No, no, not yet. Okay, I'll go back to see if I can't dream up something else. You're not sleeping up there, are you? Sleeping, I haven't slept for days. I'm eating aspirin tablets like peanuts. Gentlemen, I've got it. What? The first time ever I've been able to beat this game. - Yes? - Look. - No. - Why don't you all go down to the broadcasting station. Maybe if I was alone, I could think of something. Okay, Jimmy, we'll get out. Sampson, come on. Yes? No, not yet. - Listen. Would ya put that thing off the hook and leave it off? Thank you, sir. Yeah. Are ya all right, Jimmy? Oh, yes, yeah, I'm just beginning to get my second wind. Well, you better think of something. Yeah. It's 7:30, you heard from Jimmy, yet? No, nobody answers the phone. How are we go to on the air? Brother, when the chimes indicate eight o'clock, you're on the air. From coast to coast. Oh. Coming, Mr. Haskell, coming. Well, it's about time. Why didn't you answer the telephone? Well, madam, you see.. I want to talk to the, well, how do you like that? Oh! Come on, wake up. Come on, get up, get up, will you? I can't do it, I can't do it, it's against the law. Come on, it's Molly. Oh, get up. Oh, yeah. It's you. Yes, it's me, now come on. I suppose you wanna know how I'm gonna give away that thousand dollars. Well, I haven't the slightest idea. Now go home, go home. "Go home," he says. You come down outta there as fast as you can. On your feet, big boy. If you think the McCorkles are gonna let any Haskell fight their battles for them, you're cuckoo. Now, if you think the Haskells are gonna let the McCorkles kick them around, you're cuckoo too. No go on, go away, go away. Still gonna sleep, huh? Uh oh, now just a second. Don't you dare. Madam, you can't do that. Where's the telephone? Now what do you think you're doin'? I'm going to tell the government man exactly what happened. - Oh, no you're not. - Oh, yes I am. Here, gimme that! Come on, Jimmy, I've made up my mind. - Let me have that phone. Give me that phone. Now, let go of that phone. No, I won't. All right! Millions of other telephones. That's it! That's what? Hands spinning around, millions of telephones, millions of telephone books. Parks! And it's not a lottery. - You are cuckoo. - Get my coat. Goodbye. Oh! The "Haskell Happiness Hour" presents the radio sensation of the nation, the Pot o' Gold, featuring Horace Heidt and his Musical Knights.

And furthermore, I'm not going to give away one penny! Okay, well I've got three men in the sponsor's room right now, who are begging to buy this program. Buy it, they must be crazy. Oh, is that so? Well, they represent the biggest advertising agencies in this country. Ah. What? Wait a minute, wait a minute. We want you to be the one that Horace is going to call a little bit later.

Gentlemen, this is Mr. Haskell. How do you do, gentlemen? The surest fire advertising stunt I've ever seen. Do you want to sell it? Is it good? I'll give you 20,000 for it, right now.

Mom! Ladies and gentlemen, I want to introduce the two young people who originated this program, and which will be a permanent feature of the "Haskell Happiness Hour." Miss Molly McCorkle and my nephew, Mr. James Haskell. Yay! Say something, tell 'em how happy you are. Hello, everybody. I just want to tell you how happy I am that everything turned out so well for everybody. Uh, ladies and gentlemen, the reason she's so happy is that we're gonna be married any second now.
