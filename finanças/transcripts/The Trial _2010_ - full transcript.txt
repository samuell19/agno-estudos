[ ChiIdren's Voices, Indistinct ] [ Voices Fade ] [ Lock UnIocking ] [ Cover SIiding Open ] [ Hammer Cocks ] [ Tires Screeching, Horns Honking ] [ Phone Rings ] [ Rings ] [ Rings ] [ Gun CIatters On Desktop ] [ Rings ] Hello. l'm fine. Thank you for asking. Yes. ls this personal, Judge? All right. [ lnhales ] Uh, give me 30 minutes. [ Sighs ] Mac, here's an order appointing you to represent Peter Thomason... in the Hightower murder case. Gene Nelson's the public defender. He called an hour ago with a conflict of interest... with one of the government witnesses. Now, if there's a conviction, l can't risk a habeas corpus down the road... from some bleeding-heart lawyer based on ineffective assistance of counsel. - l'm retired. - No, you quit. But last l checked, you still have a law license... and you still live in my district. Let someone else make a name for themselves. l can't appoint someone who's only handled a few nolo pleas in traffic court... to a murder charge. Now, l can order you to do this. when you gonna start living again, Mac? There would've been a time when you would've asked me to order you. l'm not that lawyer anymore. Talk with Gene and meet with the defendant... and come see me Monday morning. [ Mac ] Hey, Gene, you got a minute? The judge wants me to speak to Peter Thomason. l thought you retired. Yeah, well, what can you tell me about the case? They found the girl in the car, but she didn't die from the accident. She was strangled. Cops found Thomason wandering around the scene with the keys in his pocket. He was doped up. Claims he can't remember anything. - Any witnesses? - Not to the murder. Police report mentions a guy in a pickup. - Saw the girl's Porsche heading up the mountain. - Anything else? Joe whetstone just made an offer. Joe whetstone? Alex Hightower didn't trust the local D.A. to do a good job... so he hired whetstone as special prosecutor. what's the offer? Twenty-five years to serve. Thomason will be younger than you when he gets out. Yeah. - Does Thomason know about the offer? - Not yet. Getting him to take a plea... will be a lot easier for you than convincing the jury to let him go. Yeah. He'd be a fool if he doesn't take the deal. This case is a dog. [ Buzzing ] Peter? - Mac McClain. - lt's Pete. Okay, Pete. The public defender that was gonna represent you has a conflict of interest... and can't handle the case. The judge has asked me to take it. The prosecution has made an offer. Twenty-five years, which at your age, is a lot better than life. - Twenty-five years? - Mm-hmm. - Do I have to say I'm guiIty? - Yep. No way. l didn't do it. Did you make a statement to the police? - I don't think so. - You don't think so? - l don't remember. - You don't remember? l remember picking Angela up and taking her to dinner. The next thing l remember is a camera flashing a bright light... when they took my picture here. - Did you take any drugs? - No. Then can you expIain why there were drugs in your system? No. Right. [ Sighs ] One last question. How can you say you're innocent if you don't remember anything? Because you don't kill someone that you love. Do you need anything? There's not a lot to do here. Think somebody can go get some books from my apartment? Make a list. what do you want? Judge Danielson wants me to defend a murder case. You're in no shape to handIe a murder case. He thinks I am. Judge Danielson's been on the bench too long. There's a plea offer. l went to the jail and spoke to the defendant. He doesn't want to take it. Claims he would've never done anything to hurt her. That's convincing. He reminds me of my son. - which one? - Zach. Something about the look in his eyes. The way he taIks. That's no reason to get involved. You're not the onIy one that Iost Laura and the boys. She was my sister. So, whatever reasons you got to help this kid, whoever he reminds you of... will not fix you, will not bring them back. Mac. Sausage biscuits. You're getting too skinny. [ Sighs ] [ Clears Throat ] Let's see. [ Knocking ] [ DanieIson ] Come inI l'll do it. Here's your order. Try to file any additional motions as soon as you can. Oh. Can l get an advance to pay an assistant? - You bet. - Hire an investigator. You got it. After this is over, l'll let you rest in peace. Looks like you're having fun. Oh, yeah. About as much fun as when l got braces. well, why don't you come back to work for me? - You're retired. - Yeah. But the judge has made me an offer l can't refuse. Am l getting paid? Yes. But l can't promise you one of those aprons. [ PIate Shatters ] [ Man ] Hey, Mindy, can you cIean this up? Don't say too much, or you'll talk me out of it. - All right, any questions? - [ Mindy ] Yes. Did he kill her? weII, you know that's the wrong question. what is the evidence? weII, that's what you two are gonna heIp me find out. Pete Thomason says he doesn't remember anything. we need an expert to shrink his head and find out what's in it. - Have you guys ever heard of Dr. Anna wiIkes? - [ Mac ] No. well, Mike Bender in Rossville says she has a good reputation with their judges... and she stands her ground in court. Get some references and set up an appointment. will do. [ Clears Throat ] The jury reads the newspaper. we need to make our own press release. My boyfriend Eddie can do it. He works for the paper. Mmm. Your boyfriend Eddie is not the sharpest tooI in the shed. You write it. - Make it sound like me. - well, that should be exciting. Gene Nelson's file is a mess. l want you to go through it and tab anything you think is important. Okay. ''Reasonable doubt.'' what does that mean? A reason why he's not guiIty. ExactIy. Right now, this piece of paper is empty. - Before we go to trial, l want it to be full. - Okay. There's over a hundred peopIe on this witness Iist... uh, a bunch of them from his marine corps unit. You want me to run 'em all down? No. That's a prosecutor's trick to try to wear us out. we're not gonna let that happen. l want you to start here-- Rodney McFarland. He's the guy who said he saw AngeIa's car on the road. He lives up on Grassy Mountain. After that, l want you to speak to Angela's college friends. See if they know anything. All right? Joe whetstone is a formidable opponent. He's a good prosecutor with the power of the state behind him. He's gonna try to steamroII us and our cIient... but we're not gonna let that happen. All right? Let's get to work. [ woman ] weIcome, everyone. It's great to see you. who wants to heIp me pass these out? - Thank you. - Let's all take a seat. Hey, there. Hi. All right. why don't we get started? So, did anybody face a struggIe this week that they'd be wiIIing to share? l, uh-- l went to the grocery store with a friend... and l saw a box of Jodie's favorite cookies... and I just-- I burst into tears... and l ran out of the store. l'm sorry. lt was very embarrassing. You may have felt embarrassed, but moments like that are gonna happen. - Grief is like a river. You can't dam it up. - [ SniffIes ] And you can't make it go faster. You just have to aIIow God to take you at his pace. AII right, take care, you guys. See you next time. lnteresting meeting. what's your goal? well, there's a time to mourn and a time to heal. we provide a time and a place for healing. what's your success rate? well, when you try to do it by yourself, not so good. when you ask God for help, the odds go up. well, l think l need something more tangible. l can't think of anything more tangible. Mac McClain. My assistant called you. Oh, yes, of course. Sorry. - l'm Anna. - Nice to meet you. Have you heard about the case? - Just what l've read in the paper. - Uh-huh. well, my client claims he can't remember anything. l need to find out if he's suffering from amnesia. l'd also like you to tell me if you think he's competent to stand trial. when will you need my report? As soon as possible. - l'm sorry for the rush, but-- - lt's okay. when someone's life is at stake, l'll make time. That's very kind of you. Howdy. You Rodney McFarland? Yeah, that'd be me. what ya sellin', son? Nothing. l, uh-- l'm Ray Morrison. l work for a lawyer. l'm doing a little investigating... on the night that your truck got run off the road in Dennison Springs. - Lawyer, huh? - Yep. well, l ain't hurt. l ain't injured, you know. So you can go back, you and your boss, and chase some other ambulance. No, no. He's not that kind of lawyer. l just need to speak to you for a few minutes. well, what is it you think we've been doing here, son? There we go. You saw me dip this in that bucket. Take you a little sip of that. You'll like it. lt's good. A little sip now. Don't drink it. Go ahead. lt's good. There she is. You're right. Beautiful truck. Yeah, she's a sweetie. She's pretty. l bought her brand new on the lot in Blue Ridge. You ever been to Blue Ridge? No, l haven't. what happened here? well, now that happened the night my daughter was having her baby. I was in the truck headed over the mountain, getting there as fast as I couId. Trying to get there in time, you know, and l was making good time. Lord have mercy, this thing will flat get up and go. Look at these tires. See that? Never buy foreign tires, Ray. l always buy American. Everything on this whole hill back here is made in the U.S.A. Except for my, you know-- my clock. l bought a radio clock-- General Electric-- thinking it's made in Pennsylvania. Got it home. The dang thing said ''Made in Taiwan'' on the bottom. You believe that? So, you were making good time. l was. l was making good time. lt was about midnight. l slipped around the bend. Here come two cars headed right for me. - Two cars? - Aimed right at me, both of 'em. One was a yellow car. Other one was a kind of a dark purple. This color? Yes, sir, that color right there. This one was tailing the yellow car... and l reckon them boys thought they owned the road, both of 'em. But when the yellow car run me off the road... l reckon the purple car sideswiped me. l didn't know l'd even been hit till l got home. You didn't tell the police about the other car? No, no. Like l said, l didn't even know l'd been hit till the next day. Could you tell who was driving either car? No, sir. No, sir. Never saw 'em. You know, it happened so fast. lt's-- Yeah, always does. Now, you saw me take this chip of paint right from here... and put it in this bottle, didn't you, Mr. McFarland? well, l reckon l did, son. l'm standing right here. Close enough to you to spit on your shoe. Appreciate you not doing that. She had a significant amount of roofies in her system. Roofies? Rohypnol. lt knocks you out. Anything else? No, just a little bit of alcohol. what about Thomason? Small amount of alcohol, a lot of amphetamines. Doesn't Rohypnol cause memory loss? Yeah. That's why men give it to women. Did you test Thomason's blood for Rohypnol? Mm-mmm. would you do that, please? Get me the results as soon as you can. Yeah. You don't think he couId've got a scratch in a grocery store parking Iot? This guy doesn't go to the grocery store. He's got enough squirrels and rabbits on that hilltop of his. Do you believe him? Mac, we drank from the same tin cup. we're practically kinfolk by now. l'll get this to a lab, see what they can tell us. we need to find that car. [ Man ] I'II be right back. Hey, Mac. Good to see you. So, uh, did Gene tell you about the plea offer? Yeah. You get the same deal. why should we take it? l bet you got enough in Gene's file. You can answer that. By the way, your client in our last case, did he ever get out of prison? Talk to Mr. Thomason. He should take the deal. How many years did your other client get? Thirty-five years. - Did he turn down the plea offer? - Yes. Five years. [ BaiIiff ] AII riseI God save the state of Georgia in this honorabIe court. The HonorabIe Judge wiIIiam L. DanieIson presiding. Be seated. we have, uh, severaI motions fiIed by Mr. McCIain... seeking information under Brady versus MaryIand... and the Georgia criminaI discovery statute. Mr. whetstone, what is your response? Three things, Your Honor. First, l'm delivering to Mr. McClain... photographs of Angela Hightower while she was alive and after her death. Second, the state wouId Iike to conduct a psychiatric evaIuation. l've attached the credentials of Dr. Lewis Newburn. Anything else, gentlemen? Yes, Your Honor, one more thing. Based on a review of the facts and circumstances... surrounding the murder of Angela Hightower... the state intends to seek the death penalty upon conviction of the defendant. The death penalty! Sit down. Your Honor, there is no evidence of aggravating circumstance. The defendant is guilty of murder committed in conjunction with the crime of kidnapping. Kidnapping? Miss Hightower agreed to go to dinner with my client. And a subsequent development rendered her presence with him nonconsensual. There's not enough evidence to support that. She had Rohypnol in her system. Uh, I'm not sure that your theory hoIds water, Mr. whetstone... but, uh, prosecutorial discretion buys you a little leeway. Now what this means, gentIemen... is first, we wiII have a triaI to determine guiIt or innocence. And if the defendant is found guilty... we will move immediately to determine the sentence. Your Honor, may l have a moment with my client? Death penalty? Or 25 years. That's it? Those are my only two options? You have no memory, no alibi and no explanation. [ woman ] I didn't think anyone wouId come. Here l am. l didn't know if it was important or not about the letters. l don't have the letters that she got... but l do know she wrote her dad after the third one. l mean, l just didn't think it was that big of a deal, but then this happened. - Can you show me? - Yeah. l made copies. There may be more, but she only wrote two on my computer. l mean, she was really worried about how her dad would react. l mean, it was her uncle. ''Spencer... ''Do not call or write again. ''l do not want to see or talk to you. ''lf l hear one more word from you, l'll tell my dad. ''l mean it. Get some help. Angela.'' You said there was another one to her father. Yeah. l just-- l didn't know what to do. l hope l did the right thing. Yes, you did. Do you know whether these were actually sent? well, the one to her uncle, l mailed myself. l don't know about the one to her dad. l mean, she didn't go into all the details. lt was just really creepy. l'm really glad you came. [ whetstone ] So, what have you dug up about McCIain? He's represented a lot of people in the county over the years. Some who probabIy couIdn't afford to pay. Three years ago, his wife and two sons were kiIIed in a car wreck. lt was Christmas Eve. Since then, his practice has been sIowing dying. And just recentIy, he shut his office. So, we have a lawyer with nothing to lose. That makes him dangerous. l want someone assigned to McClain at all times. But l am sorry to hear about his family. [ No Audible Dialogue ] well, he understands the nature of the charges. And he's not delusional. He's legally competent. But? He's depressed. How depressed? Severely. l would say clinically. But it doesn't explain the amnesia. what do you make of that? There are several known causes-- trauma, a blow to the head. But there were no signs of physical injury. Right. Another would be long-term drug or alcohol abuse. Despite the presence of amphetamines, he has no history of habitual use. which means? He may be faking. Yeah. Have you tested him for Rohypnol too? Yeah. we're just waiting for the results to come back. well, good. Let me know. lt could make a huge difference in my report. Thank you. You think she'll be a good witness? l believed her. You could reopen the office. [ Panting ] Answering machine. [ Exhales ] Oh, and one more thing. You could get one of these too. She's right about the cell phone. [ Pete ] Spencer is her uncIe. He's not much older than she is. Now l know why she didn't like him so much. Hmm. This is gonna be very heIpfuI for your case. The state psychiatrist is sitting over there. Answer his questions. But remember, he is not your friend... and he is not here to help you. lf he gets out of line, we'll be watching. He's all yours, Doctor. You'll have my report the same day Mr. whetstone does. Fair and impartial, l'm sure. l look forward to seeing you in court. - How do you think that's gonna go? - Not good. lt never does. No. Mr. McClain. Hi. Uh, this is Hunter, my son. This is Mr. McClain. Hunter? Ooh, that's a good grip. - How old are you? - Ten and a half. Ten and a half. That's a great age. would you care to join us? Okay. we're starving. we just got back from Jacks River Falls. You've heard of it? Sure. l used to go there all the time with my boys. There's a great store along the way where you can buy boiled peanuts. - I've never had a boiIed peanut. - You never had a boiled peanut? Man, my boy Zach could eat a whole bag of 'em. Hunter, why don't you go see what's in the dessert case? Okay. Did you get my report? Yeah. Thanks. Uh, it's gonna be very helpful. But Pete tested negative for Rohypnol. Really? why don't you try testing him for G.H.B.? lt's a close relative. G.H.B. Okay. They have three pieces of peanut butter pie. Peanut butter pie? l love peanut butter pie, and it's a lot better than boiled peanuts. These paint chips are from a mid-'90s sedan. Mindy, call the department of motor vehicles. See if you can find a match. ln every criminal case, you want to put someone else on trial. That's our man. Spencer Hightower. [ Shutter Clicks ] [ Sighs, Clears Throat ] what seems to be the problem? l need to take a look at the financial records for the Spencer Hightower Trust. Those are privileged. well, Judge Danielson doesn't agree. Dr. Newburn doesn't believe our client. Hmm. [ Scoffs ] ''Sociopathic homicidal tendencies.'' - weII-- - God. - that didn't surprise me. - Hmm. Let's call Dr. wilkes. Tell her l'd like to see her as soon as possible. Okay. what time are we due back in Atlanta? The deposition starts at 4:30. lf we're not out of there in 1 5 minutes, pull the fire alarm. Um... - put your shoulder back. - [ Car Door CIoses ] Good. And bend your knees. Okay, and throw! She's got you all twisted up like a pretzel. You can't teach baseball from a book. Come here. So, just get a good grip on that. And l want you to throw a fastball. Let's see that. - Nice! Got another glove? - Yeah. There you go. That's a nice glove. lt's my dad's. Yeah. He passed away. l'm sorry to hear that. lt's okay. But l still really miss him. All right, you wanna put some heat on it? All right. There you go. [ whetstone ] Let's make this quick. Mr. Hightower. Bring me up-to-date. well, there's been a change in defense attorneys. - who is it? - Mac McClain. Are you sure you can handle him? well, l would hope you know the answer to that. Here's a detailed summary outlining our preparations for trial. May be your case, but she was my daughter. [ Mac ] I'm sorry about your husband. [ Anna ] what did Hunter say? Only that he passed away and that he missed him. well, he doesn't know the whole story. lt was suicide. l'm sorry. EventuaIIy he's gonna ask me questions that, uh... l don't know how to explain. Tell him the truth. ls that what you tell all your witnesses? I started that group that you came to right after he died. A lot of people need a time and a place to heal, including me. l don't agree with Dr. Newburn's assessment of my client. He said he's a psychotic with homicidaI tendencies. [ BeII Gongs ] Hey, Mark. Excuse me. Good morning, counselor. Mr. whetstone. l never heard from you. Of course, l didn't really expect to. l've seen a lot of guys like you over the years. Good men. Good attorneys. But they're trying to fix something in themselves by way of their clients. lt never works. You're goin' down with the ship. Deal's off the table for good. This trial is necessary... because a beautiful 21 -year-old woman is dead. l wish we weren't here today. Mr. Alexander Hightower... desperately wishes we weren't here today. Let me speak for Angela. Let me walk you through the events leading up to her murder through her eyes. The defendant had won her trust and the trust of her father. On August 2, he came to the Hightower home, spoke briefly with Mr. Hightower... and then took his daughter to Atlanta in her yellow Porsche. Now... l don't know what, uh, the defendant and Angela talked about that night. l don't know what they ate at that quiet little ltalian restaurant. But l do know she never came home. At some point, the defendant offered Angela something to drink. lt might have been a soft drink, a cup of coffee. But whatever it was... it was no ordinary beverage. Because inside that glass or cup... were a few drops of a colorless, odorless, tasteless drug... called Rohypnol. Roofies. As soon as that was in her system, Angela was helpless. And the evidence will show that... the defendant took drugs himself on August 2. Sometime around midnight, sheriff's deputies responded to a call... and found Angela in her car... dead. But she wasn't killed in a car wreck. She was murdered. And the defendant was found at the scene of the crime... with the keys to her car in his pocket. Now, is that all the evidence? No. A psychiatrist wiII give you understanding... about the defendant's mental capacity to commit such a horrible crime. Police will piece together the events of August 2. And when all the evidence has been presented... l will stand here... and l will ask you to do your duty for the state of Georgia-- for Angela-- and find the defendant guilty of murder. Ladies and gentlemen... l cannot think of anything more serious... than deciding the fate of another human being. when we entered the courtroom this morning... the clock began ticking on an experience that none of us will ever forget. My job is to guide you through this process. Not to tell you what to think. Not to bully you. But to treat you with the respect that service on this jury deserves. First, please remember what Judge Danielson said. Nothing we lawyers say to you is evidence. Second, l agree with everything that Mr. whetstone said about Angela Hightower. Her life was cut off before she had a chance to live it... and someone should be brought to justice... and someone should be punished for that crime. However, the evidence will prove... that the person most likely responsible for Angela Hightower's death... is not in this courtroom. Not yet. Third, the prosecution wiII present its side of the case first. The book of Proverbs tells us... that the first to present his side of the case seems right... until another comes forward and questions it. That is wisdom from the ages... and l would ask you to apply it to your responsibilities here today. Thank you. Proceed with the state's case, Mr. whetstone. Your Honor, the state calls Lieutenant walter Monroe. Oh, no. Please introduce yourself to the jury, Lieutenant. Lieutenant walter Monroe, United States Marine Corps... currently serving at Parris lsland, South Carolina... after completing a tour of duty in lraq. well, on behalf of the entire courtroom... l'd like to thank you for your service to our country, Lieutenant. CouId you pIease teII us how you know Peter Thomason... the defendant in this case? Thomason was in my unit before he received a general discharge. A general discharge? He didn't receive an honorable discharge? Objection, Your Honor. lrrelevant. Your Honor, I can Iay the foundation for this. Overruled. Proceed. No, sir. According to the records, he did not receive an honorable discharge. Are these records in your possession? Your Honor, these records are irreIevant. Your Honor, these are business records which show prior simiIar conduct. Lieutenant, uh, are you the custodian of these records? Yes, sir. Maintaining these records is a part of my duty as a staff officer. Overruled. why did the defendant not receive an honorabIe discharge? ''Gross misconduct involving attempted administration... of an iIIegaI substance to a civiIian. '' [ whetstone ] And what was that substance? Rohypnol. And the gender of the civilian? Female. Your Honor... we tender State's exhibit 1 . Any objection? l object, Your Honor. Same reasons as before. Overruled. Admitted. [ whetstone ] Your witness. No questions at this time. You have no idea the impact this is gonna have on the jury. Start talking. Just after boot camp... l went out one night with Lieutenant Monroe and a buddy named Harry O'Ryan. They met some girls, and l went home early. l guess something happened to the girl's drink 'cause she ended up in the hospital. And Lieutenant Monroe convinced Harry to say that l did it. So, l took a general discharge to avoid a court-martial. where is this Harry O'Ryan now? Last l heard, he was out of the corps. You blew it, Mac. Monroe was on my witness list. You should have let me do my job. And what were the resuIts of your testing for RohypnoI... in the blood sample from Angela Hightower? - Positive at a clinically significant level. - which means? which means that for a period before her death... she would have suffered from the effects l just described. - Disorientation? - Yes. - Impaired judgment? - Yes. - Limited cognitive function? - Yes. lnability to protect herself? Yes, she was helpless. Your witness, Mr. McClain. Doctor, did you test Mr. Thomason's blood for Rohypnol? Yes. lt was negative. Have you ever heard of gamma hydroxybutyric? Yes. It's not very common. It's known by the initiaIs G.H.B. Mm-hmm. You know how it operates? Very similar effects as Rohypnol. Did you test Mr. Thomason's bIood... from the night of Angela's death for the presence of G.H.B.? - Yes. - what were the results? lt was positive. So, there was disorientation? Impaired judgment? Limited cognitive function? Yes. Pete. was Pete helpless too? Yes, he was. Thank you. [ whispering ] we should have caught that one. You remember Dr. Lewis Newburn's report? Yep. The one that said our client was a psychotic with homicidal tendencies, yeah. - That's the one. - Mm-hmm. well, this is a photo Ray took the day he followed Spencer. Guess who Spencer was going to see? The guy you used to date, the one that lived with his mom. - what was his name-- Rupert? - No. - Randall? - No. - Rudolf? - No! [ Laughs ] Dr. Lewis Newburn. And his name is Ronnie, by the way. And his mother was Iiving with himI [ Mac ] Dr. Newburn, where is your office Iocated? 400 west Lenox Street. And this is where you see your patients? Yes. Except for those in the hospitaI. Is Spencer Hightower one of your patients? No. He's a client. l thought you saw ''patients.'' l'm his financial adviser-- the trustee of a trust set up by his father. So you control his money. - Just some of it. - How much? [ whetstone ] Objection. That is irreIevant. Sustained. Are you paid for your advice? There is a fee authorized by the trust. And how much is this authorized fee? Same objection. Overruled. Around $50,000. But that had nothing to do with my evaluation of the defendant. l'm sure it didn't. No further questions, Your Honor. 501 , 503. Yes. - Harry O'Ryan! - [ Door Opens ] - [ whistles ] - Don't run! l'm not a cop! l'm here about Pete Thomason. Relax, l ain't gonna chase you. Pete's aIways been a hard-Iuck guy, but this is unbeIievabIe. He's no killer. Glad to hear you say that. Yeah. Look. This whole thing with the girls-- that was Buster's idea. Buster? Lieutenant Monroe. He slipped the girls the drugs... dropped me off at another bar down the street. Pete wasn't even with us at that point. The girls, they don't remember anything, 'cause... well, they were out of it. when things started to go south for Buster... l agreed to back him up. Pete got nailed for it. Look. Buster's still in the corps. He'll say anything to make sure his record stays clean. which is why Pete needs you. No, man, l don't-- Look, l'd like to help and all, but l just don't think so. He needs your help. lf you do this, you will unburden yourself... give yourself one less thing to chase you. well, now, it was a warm night that night... so l had rolled my window down to let some air in, you know. And of course, l can spit out of it too... and l don't have to use my spit cup l keep in the front seat. How fast were you traveling, Rodney? Uh, well-- [ Clears Throat ] uh, Judge, l ain't gonna lie to you. Now, l was speeding. l was going too fast that night. Now, l had a good excuse. l was trying to get to the hospital. My daughter was having her baby. And l was going just a little too fast, l reckon. But, now, I'm a good driver. I'm a good driver. I ain't had a ticket since 1958. And you can Iook that up. That's aII typed on the record. You can ask anybody, but that night, yeah, l was going a little too fast. I had too much truck. It's that oId '71 I had. Ross weatherford soId me that thing. It was brand new. l paid too much money for it too. lt was just too much truck. Mr. McFarIand, couId you teII us what caused you to run off the road that night? well, it was-- it was that yellow car, followed by that purple car. And how close was the purple car to the yellow Porsche? Oh, son, if he'd have been any closer, he could've hooked on bumpers for a free tow. l mean, he was in his hip pocket, you know. And, Judge, another thing about that purple car. Uh, he-he hit my truck that night. And as of yet, ain't nobody stepped up to pay for it. I'm waiting. Thank you, Mr. McFarIand. No more questions. Can you teII us what tests you performed, Dr. wiIkes? w.A.l.S. l.Q. testing, Rorschach... Beck's Depression lnventory and general achievement testing. And have you read Dr. Newburn's evaIuation? l have. what's your opinion about the vaIidity of his report? l disagree with its findings. Mr. Thomason is not a sociopath. He's depressed. And how is your report different from Dr. Newburn's? My evaIuation is based on objective testing and a cIinicaI interview. Dr. Newburn's opinion is based solely on one brief interview. Thank you. Your witness. Ms. wilkes, who hired you in this case? Excuse me, Your Honor. lt's Dr. wilkes. The witness has been quaIified as an expert. Dr. wilkes. I was contacted by Mr. McCIain's office. would it be fair to say that your contact with Mr. McClain... has gone beyond the professional? Objection, Your Honor. IrreIevant. He's got her on cross. OverruIed. The witness wiII answer the question. Of course not. Your Honor, these photographs were previously entered into evidence. Permission to publish? Granted. Could you, uh, tell the jury... what's going on in this picture? Mr. McCIain and I are sharing a piece of peanut butter pie. - was it good? - Yeah. lf you like peanut butter. And, uh, hmm... what about this one? That's Mr. McClain in front of my house. l have a home office. Did you, uh, do anything besides taIk about this case? He played catch with my son. we drank coffee. Don't you think this jury should be concerned... about the neutrality of your opinion? Not at all. Mr. McClain is a fine man... but my opinion on his client is based on testing. l'm sure it is. Pete had nothing to do with this. He was already back at the base. Harry, can you tell the court why you wanted to come forward today and tell the truth? Um, well, when l heard that Pete had been charged with murder... and that Lieutenant Monroe was testifying against him... l knew that l had to come forward, clear the record. l guess l was just... tired of having this follow me around. Thank you. No more questions. Your witness. [ Clears Throat ] Mr. O'Ryan... how many different stories have you told about what happened that night? At least two. And in both versions, you didn't do anything wrong, did you? You mean besides not telling the truth? well, you've had some problems in the past with telling the truth, haven't you? I mean, for instance, if you write a bad check... well, that's a lie, isn't it? I mean, you're saying you have money in the bank that you don't have. No, not exactly. Are you the same Harry O'Ryan convicted of writing bad checks... to convenience stores, gas stations and liquor stores... in Kentucky, Tennessee, North CaroIina and Georgia? Yes. Do you know how many faIse writings are represented in these pages? No. well, would you be interested in learning that you've written 1 37 bad checks... during the past two and haIf years... resuIting in 13 arrest warrants in four different states? l've made some mistakes. wouId you Iike to add perjury to the Iist of crimes you caII mistakes? - [ Mac ] Objection - withdrawn. [Inmates Chattering ] l'm ready. And l see why you wanted me to go last. 'Cause now that l've heard everybody else, l think it's gonna help me a lot. Unless you can think of something else, you're not going to testify. why? l'll tell the truth. what-- that you loved her and that you can't remember anything? lf you look dumb, Joe whetstone will make you look guilty. we have a chance to win this. l want the last thing the jury sees and hears... is to be Spencer Hightower's face and what he has to say. The defense would like to call Alexander Hightower to the stand, Your Honor. Mr. Hightower, would you read this to the jury please? whole thing? Yes. The whole thing. [ Clears Throat ] ''Dear Dad... ''I don't know how to teII you this except to come out and say it. ''Spencer has been bothering me. ''He's been writing me letters, saying things he shouldn't say... ''and asking if he could come visit me here at school. ''I caIIed him and toId him to stop, but he won't Ieave me aIone. ''Over Christmas break, he made a pass at me. ''l slapped him and he got mad, and l hoped that was the end of it. ''He won't stop calling. He won't stop bothering me. ''You have to make him get some help. ''He is scaring me. ''PIease-- ''Please make it end. ''l know you'll take care of it, Dad. Love, Angela.'' - Did you receive this Ietter, Mr. Hightower? - No. l did not. Do you wish you had? Oh, yeah. No further questions. Mr. Hightower. who was the last person you saw with Angela? The defendant, when he picked her up. And do you know where your brother Spencer was that night? He was with me. No more questions, Your Honor. Mr. Hightower has suffered enough. Mr. Hightower, you may step down. The defense calls Spencer Hightower to the stand. How ya doin'? Mr. Hightower, would you read this to the jury, please? ''Spencer, do not call or write again. ''l do not want to see you or talk to you. ''lf l hear one more word from you, l'll tell my dad. ''l mean it. Get some help. Angela.'' Did you receive that Ietter? Yeah. Sounds like Angela was quite upset with you, doesn't it? - I don't know. - She was tired of you harassing her, wasn't she? lt was, uh-- lt was a misunderstanding. I didn't harass her. Did she sIap you at a Christmas party? - lt was more of a push. - A push. why wouId she have to push you? what were you trying to do? - Nothing. It was no big deaI. - No big deal. ls that how Angela would've phrased it-- that it was ''no big deal''? l don't know. why don't you ask her? And we can't do that, can we, Mr. Hightower? Mr. Hightower. This is a bank statement from your personal trust. would it surprise you to know that there was a $50,000 cash withdrawal... two days before the death of Angela? Objection, Your Honor. The witness's bank records are irrelevant. Sustained. Thank you. Are you a wealthy man, Mr. Hightower? well, it depends on who you compare me to. How about if we compare you to most people in Echota County? Most people from Echota County live in trailers. Are you trying to be funny? Listen, Mr. McDonald, or whatever your name is... - l shouldn't be here answering your stupid questions. - [ GaveI Raps ] You're here because Mr. McClain called you as a witness... and you wiII answer every single one of his questions... unless l instruct you to do otherwise. Do you understand? Yes, Your Honor. Did you hire someone to kill Angela? That's a stupid question. But the answer is no. Did you drug Angela and Pete to make it look like he was responsible? No. No more questions. Thank you. [ Scoffs ] [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ Mac ] ''ReasonabIe doubt''-- two words we rarely use in everyday conversation. Let me tell you what it means. Some portion of your mind may suspect Peter Thomason is guilty... but if, after considering all the evidence... you remain wavering and unsettled... it is your duty to give Pete the benefit of the doubt... and find him not guilty of these charges. ln my opening statement, l said the person most likely responsible... for the murder of Angela Hightower was not in this courtroom. Now you know why l made that statement. l'm not here to prosecute Spencer Hightower. That is a case for another day, and l trust that day come soon. Mr. whetstone is going to speak to you after l finish. Listen to him carefully. That's right. Listen to him carefully. And then ask yourself if he has answered to your satisfaction... each and every one of the grounds for reasonable doubt. He can't do it. Because the truth is Peter Thomason did not kill Angela Hightower. And l ask you, on his behalf... to find him not guilty. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen... the technique used by the defendant and his lawyer against these charges... is called a ''red herring defense.'' Now, a red herring is a fish that protects its eggs from predators... by darting in front of the enemy... and diverting attention from where the eggs are hidden. ln this trial... the defendant views you as the enemy... because you have the power to take away his freedom. He's desperate and he has resorted to skillful measures... in order to distract you from your rightful goal. The red herring is a very smart fish. Mr. McClain is a very smart lawyer. Every one of the defenses that Mr. McClain has raised... is a red herring calculated to keep you from focusing on the evidence. Use your common sense. The defendant was captured by the police at the scene of the crime. He is the only person who had the opportunity and the motive... to have murdered Angela. Peter Thomason is a predator with a history. we all wish Angela could be with us today... but she can't. On Angela's behalf... l have complete confidence in your ability... to render the only just verdict possible in this case-- a verdict of guilty. Court is adjourned untiI Monday morning at 9.00 a.m. [ GaveI Raps ] what do you think they'll decide? ls it a good jury? lf l can get one on my side, l can hang it. lf l can get three, they'll convince the rest. Are you scared? Yes. why? Because someone's life is in my hands. Ladies and gentIemen of the jury... have you reached a verdict? Yes, we have, Your Honor. will the defendant please rise? Madam Foreperson... would you please announce the verdict? we find the defendant, Peter Thomason, guilty of first-degree murder. The jury wiII return on Tuesday... to commence the sentencing phase of the case. Court is adjourned. [ GaveI Raps ] l'm sorry. I'm so sorry. [ Mac's Voice ] He reminds me of my son. - [ Pete ] Death penaIty? - [ Mac ] Or 25 years. [ Pete ] Those are my onIy two options? [ DanieIson ] when you gonna start Iiving again, Mac? l heard you say that grief was like a river. well, if that's the case, then l'm drowning. You spend your whole life looking for that special someone. Then you find her, you build a life together... you raise two of the greatest kids in the world. And then it's all taken from you... without your having a chance to even say good-bye. And it's all your fault. How do you come back from that? l want to believe that there is a time and a place to heal. But when is that time and where is that place for me? [ Sniffles ] when you've come as far as you can by yourself... you Iet go... and you reaIize... that God has a reason that your Iife didn't end that night too. [ Sighs ] [ Chuckles ] [ Sniffles, Sighs ] Right before Judge Danielson called me and asked me to take this case... l held a gun in one hand and a bottle of pills in the other. l was trying to decide which way to end my life. That phone call saved me from making a terrible mistake. when you retire to the jury room... l'm going to ask you to consider one word in deciding Pete's fate. what is that word? The word l want you to think about is an ordinary word. Standing alone, it doesn't inspire emotion, doesn't pull at the heartstrings. Ladies and gentlemen, the word is ''life.'' we live in a world where human life is cheap. People suffer and people starve, and nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care. But as a member of this jury... you are part of a system of justice... that affirms life as inherently valuable... a gift from God that should not be taken away... except in the most extraordinary circumstances. what l know now and what l didn't know... when l held that gun and those pills in my hand... is that life has value... no matter how dark the past or tortured the present. Ladies and gentlemen, you have two choices before you-- life or death. l ask you to choose life. For you. - Cell phone. [ Chuckles ] - Ahh. - Thank you-- - You're welcome. - l think. - Jury's in. [ DanieIson ] Have you reached a decision? Yes, sir, we have. will the defendant please rise? Madam Foreperson, wouId you pIease announce the decision? we recommend a life sentence with a possibility of parole. Don't worry. Hey, Mac. l'm glad you didn't pull the trigger. This isn't over. l'm going to file a motion for a new trial. we're gonna keep digging. [ Clears Throat ] Did you discover something? Five of the companies that receive money from the trust all have the same president. - Spencer. - No. Dr. Lewis Newburn. Now why wouId Spencer set Dr. Newburn up as head of a bunch of dummy companies? That's a good question. Let's get subpoenas for detailed records on all five companies... and serve Newburn before the end of the day. l bet that doctor knows more about what's going on with Spencer than he's admitted. l bet you're right. From Mac McClain. Have a nice day. She's a beauty. Just put her out. Uh, what can you tell me about her? One owner, low miles. Other than those minor scratches there in the front, she's in perfect condition. - Did you handle the trade-in? - Sure did. Guy wanted to trade it in for something he could take off-road with instead. This baby's built to be king of the highway, not slogging through a mudhole. - She's got power-- - l'll take it. One condition-- l'd like to speak with the original owner. - we don't normally-- - l got cash, in case you want to sling this sled today. [ Newburn ] And stick cIose to the phone. I want to be abIe to get you at a moment's notice. Don't screw up Iike you did the Iast time. Give me about an hour. wait for the call. Then go get him. [ Door Opens ] Yeah? [ Door CIoses ] Back here! [ Chuckles ] - Dr. Newburn. - l, um-- l was on the way home, so l brought those records you requested. Thank you. You can set them down right there. [ Sighs ] - You got any more coffee? - Sure. - Thank you. - You're welcome. ''Newly discovered evidence.'' [ Chuckles ] ls that what this is? Maybe. Hey, maybe you could save us a bunch of time and tell us what's inside. [ Chuckles ] well, uh, that l'm the president of each of the companies. who are the other shareholders? Let me ask you a question, Mr. McClain. Are you going to go after Spencer with the evidence l'm giving you? whatever it takes to help my client. l'm sure you will. Have you considered the effect it might have? You see, what concerns me is the effect it might have on me. well, just like the bank, you had to answer the subpoena. You know, you're a slick lawyer, Mr. McClain. But this is one thing you didn't figure out. You see, you're going to ask your questions, and Alex will ask his. And he's going to ask questions that l don't want to answer. You see, Spencer doesn't know about the companies. They weren't set up for him. He has plenty of money. You embezzled. well, did you know that Alex and Angela both have trusts too? And that upon their deaths, that money is going to fIow directIy into Spencer's trust... and, well, he doesn't keep close tabs on it. Alex isn't dead. Not yet. [ Mac Groaning ] Yeah, come get him. l've done most of your work for you. [ Mac Coughs ] well, now, Mr. McClain-- [ Chuckles ] looks like you're going to take a swim. You see, here's what l thought. l thought maybe you got yourself drunk... and you fell off the pier after you lost the case. Huh? - How's that sound? - [ Coughs ] No? Okay. Better yet. You finally got the nerve to kill yourself. lt was suicide. [ Chuckles ] what do you think about that? How do you feeI? Disoriented? lmpaired judgment? Maybe you don't feel like you can protect yourself! [ Panting, Chuckles ] That's pretty good for what you got in your system. [ CeII Phone Rings ] [ Rings ] [ Rings ] [ Rings ] [ Rings ] l don't think so. [ Rings ] [ Beeps ] what are you gonna do with that? [ Gunshot ] [ Door Opens ] - [ Groaning ] - Mac Mac Are you okay? - Let me take that. - [ Siren BIaring ] [ Ray ] They were driving a bIack sedan. It's parked out in the back there. Hey. Here you go. Drink that. You okay? How you feeling? l found the purple car. lt was a Cadillac. [ Chuckles ] [ whetstone ] So tell me, Alex, how much of all this do you want to know? All of it. well, first the hit men slipped something... into Angela and Peter's drinks at the restaurant. Then they took them to the ravine where they killed Angela... pushed her car off the cliff then planted her keys in Thomason's pocket. After the trial, you were going to be next. They found an open-ended ticket to Venezuela in the doctor's car. So it was all about the money. He'd been siphoning off millions for years. lf McClain hadn't kept digging... who knows what would have happened. what about Thomason? Judge signed a motion this morning to dismiss the charges. Thomason owes McClain a lot. l think we all do. CongratuIations. How's it feel? Come on. l'll give you a ride home. [ Chuckles ] [ Mac ] My Iife changed... the moment that l stopped asking God why my family was gone... and started thanking him that l was still here.
