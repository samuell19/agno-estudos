So, what movie are we watching? Oh, come on. You had one job... pick the movie! I know but I'm closer than I thought. The Higgs Boson perpetuating the Higgs Singlet... No, no, no. No, remember, we said no dirty talk on movie night. No. Okay, okay, fine. A little bit of time travel theory dirty talk, but no equations. Okay, so you know how I originally thought I needed a particle accelerator operating at 40 TeV to test my theories. Oh, boy. Do I ever. 'Kay but I think with a few more adjustments I could get it to work at 20. Yeah but see, the Large Hadron Collider only goes to 13. Get it down to that and I'll hook you up once I get that job at CERN. I... I just don't understand why you wanna go all the way to Switzerland. I don't know why you won't apply for a job there. No one has a bigger hard-on for the LHC than you do. 'Cause Dr. Rowley's here. But she doesn't even have a particle accelerator! Why do you care so much if I move to Switzerland anyway? Hmm? (CHUCKLING) I don't. I don't care. Great. Yeah. Go. Enjoy. - I will go. - Go to Switzerland... - I am going. - Enjoy the mountains... - That's what I'm gonna do. - ...and the chocolates and the little army knives and mysterious bank accounts. Enjoy. Oh my god. What are you doing? Oh, I am taking mine to go. But what about... what about movie night? (SCOFFING) The only reason why you came out of the garage is because you're literally starving and I had food. I'm not literally starving. Meredith made me pancakes. (SIGHING) You know what? Don't worry about it. - We'll just do it tomorrow night. - Ah... And don't try to tell me that you have plans, because the only person that you could possibly have plans with is currently standing in front of you giving you a lecture about how you don't have any plans. Don't stay up late. I'll pick you up for work at 8:00. (DOOR CLOSING) MEREDITH: Honest to God, bro. Hey, if you're not gonna date Courtney, can I? I'm right in the middle of something here, okay? Absolutely. Super, super-duper important science stuff, right? Mm-hm. Gotcha. (CAR ENGINE STARTING) Hey, so, I thought that you'd like to know that tomorrow is the 15th anniversary. I know what day it is. Right, so, I thought that we should... spread the ashes. I really don't think this is the right year for that. Mm-hm, but you've been saying that every year - since the tenth anniversary. - I feel like it's more of a 20th anniversary sort of thing, you know, a nice round number. Yeah but it's gonna suck whenever we do it, James, whether it's... (SIGHING) ...then or now, so we... James. Another time. (SIGHING) James. Fine. Fine. I'll... I'll meet you there tomorrow after work, okay? Okay. Hey. I think I'm gonna be up for a while. Can you please make me a cup of coffee, please? Dude, you have a PhD in experimental particle things.

Very, very funny. Well done. You got me. Meredith, you can come out now, okay? And by the way, in the history of shitty sisterly things that you have done to me, this one takes the prize! Look, I know it's a lot to take in. All right? It's a lot to digest, absorb. (SIGHING) Oh my God. Okay, all right. Okay. Sure, I'll play. So you're me, from the future. So tell me, Me, how do we execute my brilliant time travel theories, huh? You already know. You're working on it. Harnessing the power of the particle collider. Okay. Very, very impressive research. You've been briefed, I see. Now, has my idiot sister also told you that the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland operates at a TeV of 13... Yeah, and you need 40. I know. But what you don't know is that Rowley already has one. She does? Wow, okay. So tell me, where does she, uh, where does she keep this multi-billion dollar enormous secret machine? That's the crazy part. It's tiny! It's like... it's like this big. She keeps it in her office behind a table! Oh, behind the table. All right. Why would he believe that? That necklace that you're hiding inside your shirt, with the ashes of Mom and Dad in it... Meredith has one of those too. And in fact, tomorrow is the 15th anniversary of the day that their plane went... Okay, you listen to me, buster.

Did this man's penis in fact resemble yours? Maybe you could work with our sketch artist. Can't you do one of those line-up things? What? I'm not looking at a row of weird dicks. Look, the point is, I'm not even pressing charges here. This man... Hey, you called us. She called you. You're an idiot. What are you gonna do? You're just gonna let this guy walk away after everything that he did to you? You've done so much worse to me and I sleep in the room next to you with the door unlocked.

She said she wants us all in for an announcement in 20 minutes. An announcement.

(SIGHING) Looks like The Great and Powerful Oz hasn't materialized yet. You know, for someone who spends so much time worshipping CERN's Hadron Collider, you do your fair share of mocking the person who actually helped build the thing and who wrote you a very nice letter of reference, I might add. I'm sorry, I missed that due to cataclysmic boredom. Ha ha. Attention, colleagues. As you know, the Rowley Institute has recently celebrated its third year. (APPLAUSE) (CLEARING THROAT) Where was I? Attention, colleagues. As you know, the Rowley Institute has recently celebrated its third year since opening its doors. Now you applaud. Our stock has shown unprecedented growth resulting in an influx in financing. I have convinced the board to allow me to use this money to... ..offer a permanent position to one of you, my valued employees and colleagues, where you will lead a team on a new project of your choosing. Project submissions are due Friday. And remember, a tiny change today... ALL: ...brings a dramatically different tomorrow. This is another place where you applaud. (APPLAUSE) So here's the facts. We know that I invent time travel. We know that I do it with Rowley. Hey! Dr. Rowley, you're not gonna believe this. I'm gonna become a future time tra... That doesn't work. She'd fire my ass. Should tell Courtney. How can we not tell Courtney? I feel like not telling Courtney's a dick move. Courtney, you're not gonna believe this. I become a time traveller. I figure out time time travel and I come back and I take myself hostage and I pull down my pants and I show myself my penis. Ah! Why does every scenario end with me showing someone my dick? Oh... wait a minute! I talk to him. Pros and cons. Pros, talk to him, you get some answers. How did it work? How did you figure it out? How far back can we go? Cons, mmm, interacting with him could create a paradox, could destroy the entire universe. That's very bad. Paradoxes are bad. Universe is good. Of course, I talked to him yesterday. Talked to him yesterday, universe still here. Universe is fine, right? (SCOFFING) Universe is good. Should I go alone or should I bring someone? I should bring someone. Should I bring someone? No, not gonna bring her. Okay. Here we go. ♪ FUTURE JAMES: In here! How'd you know I just got here? Well, we have the same memory. Although things keep changing so it kinda updates. I don't know, it's hard to explain. You mean like a... like a download? Uh, sorta like déjà vu, only backwards. And colder. 30 minutes ago you decided you were gonna come find me and so my memory changes. You're taller than me. Oh, yeah. Taller, better, slightly bigger dick. Time travel really fucks you up, man. The past and the present both pullin' you towards them, it stretches you out a little bit each time. More, depending on how far back you go. I mean, this trip did me in, man. Look at me! I think my brain's stretching too. Put those on the table, would ya? Yeah. Hey, when did we learn to bake? Oh, about the same time we learn sewing and gardening, how to build an off-the-grid sewage system. See, that... that's amazing to me. You want me to give all that up? Yeah, well, we are forced to learn all that because we have to live in isolation! And rely on our survival skills, which, by the way, you don't fucking have. What else? What else? Come on, I'm all ears. - Tell me more. - (SIGHING) Look, time travel... it's amazing, for like ten minutes. And then it's like you're being forced to watch reruns of a show that you hate and can't turn off. I have no idea what that means but I want you to tell me everything. Now tell me... tell me, how far back can we go, huh? Look, our whole life... our whole life we've had an all-consuming passion to be the master of time. But you don't even appreciate the time you're in right now! The beauty that can surround you at any given moment... Would ya slow down on the fucking croissant? Here. Little bite. Let it melt on your tongue. Hm? Slow. Slow. Mmm. Yeah. (SIPPING) Twelve years from now, Rowley and I figure out how to send me back in time. A one-way trip every time. I mean, there's no way forward. Right, so you have to stay there, just waiting for time to catch up. Exactly, exactly. And we're pushing it. I mean, we start off with a few minutes, then a day, a month, a year. Two years, three years, five years! I'm stuck in a place like this wasting away, total isolation! Meanwhile, I'm bouncing through time, Rowley's sitting in her desk, having the same cup of tea! Wait a minute, so, lemme get this straight. So what you're telling me is that on top of becoming the world's first time traveller I'm also gonna have these years of peaceful sabbaticals with nothing but solitude where I can practice my theoretical applications? Is that what you're saying? What? No! You do not want this life! Yes I do. I do want this life. You're too late! This is science. It's what I'm meant to do. You don't have a fucking clue. There's a reason I came back now. I'm still sort of a good guy when I'm you. But Friday, man, that's doomsday. You take that position, that is the beginning of the end. Your ego, your self-righteousness, it's gonna smother all the other parts of your life... love, joy, family. So I came back to stop you from making that mistake, one way or the other. What if I can do both? - (SCOFFING) - No, what if I... can change? Like, fundamentally change by Friday, and then accept the position? I'll vanish. If you truly, fundamentally change, then you won't make a complete mess of my life and there will be no reason to come back, and thus, I won't exist. Okay. But if you don't get your shit together by Friday, I am gonna fuck up your life so bad that you'll never invent time travel in the first place. - Oh, that's my... - Yeah, I know. I'm gonna need that for um... Oh, I know what you need it for, yeah. Why don't you come back for it after I'm gone? Um... You... okay. Just gonna put it in there? So, uh, quick question. - If you were me... - I am you. So, how would you advise me to start this process of change? Um, maybe have some quality time with Meredith? You need to do the thing that if you don't do it, you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life. You need to tell Courtney how you really feel about her. She's the greatest thing that ever happens to you and you just let her slip through your fingers. (QUIETLY) That's not... (CLEARING THROAT) Courtney is my friend and I do not feel that way about her. Of course you do, you just keep it all locked up inside and then you jerk off thinkin' about her, real quiet so that Meredith doesn't hear. I masturbate at an appropriate volume. What, you think I should be louder so that my sister can hear? It's eerie quiet, okay? It's like you're drivin' a fuckin' Prius. Okay, let's just say hypothetically that I did have certain feelings for Courtney. You do. How do I tell her about... that, without, you know, jeopardizing the friendship that we have? I'll show you! Yeah, I don't think that's a good idea. It'd be my pleasure. I insist. Yeah, and I... I insist that you don't. I got you. I don't know what that means... I gotcha covered. Why are we here? I should be home for my movie date with Courtney. You're meeting Meredith here to dump the ashes. She's gonna be here any minute. Right, of course. Hey! It's important. Yeah, I know. I know. Okay. So uh, what's your plan with Courtney? I'm gonna do what you said. You know, what you suggested. I'm gonna be in the moment. I feel like you're just tellin' me what I wanna hear so I'll leave.

Wait a second! Wait. So can we go back that far? No. No, I couldn't figure it out. Well, just because you couldn't doesn't mean that I can't. I'm you, genius. Show me your numbers. You know, I can pick up where you left off. I... I ran the numbers. I nearly lost my mind in the process. Look, it took me a long time to come to terms with the fact that we can't save them. I really think if you let me run the numbers... Goddamn it, listen to me! You need to take care of this. You need to be a goddamn proper fucking brother to that sister of yours, because one day she's gonna leave you. She's gonna give up on you altogether and you're gonna have nobody.

Why, so you can fuck him? Oh, man. Wow. I'm sorry, I didn't... Look, I know I screwed up last night, but I had a moment of clarity and I'm not gonna apologize for wanting to be a great scientist just because you're not fully committed to it. I'm not fully committed? Why? Why, because I actually have a life outside of this building? You know what? Maybe you're right. Maybe I am into Jimmy. Maybe I'm attracted to someone who knows how to relax and have fun and isn't focused on singlet trails when he's kissing my tits! You can't make me choose between science... No, no, no. No one's asking you to choose between anything! It's about fully committing to where you are in the moment. Right. "Wherever you are, be all there." Yes! And you don't know how to do that, James. Cat's dead. I can't help who I am. Well, you know, I... I really hope that you get everything you want, because in the meantime, I'm gonna be fully committed to what I want, in Switzerland. That's right. Dr. Keller called from CERN. I got it. I'm the first Canadian to be hired in a permanent position in the theory division.

That's why we're movin' on to plan B. Plan B? Okay! Great. Plan B. I didn't know there was a plan B. That's... What is plan B? Kill Rowley. Plan B is terrible. That's a very bad plan. Very bad plan, you can't... You can't do that. You... You wouldn't do that. We... We don't have that in us. Oh, I think we do. Wait. If you kill Rowley, sure, we don't create time travel, but then you can't come back in time in the first place to kill her anyway. You would create a paradox that would destroy the entire universe!

And all because I underestimated how much of a shithead I used to be. I think there's a way we can all win here. I really do. Oh, no.

I would offer you a cup of tea, but I'm a little tied up at the moment. It's incredible. I know. I know! And this is the work that you and I... It's incredible that you think I'm foolish enough to believe that this blubbery, bulbous, pasty-skinned, asexual, repugnant degenerate is actually you. Uh... Dr. Rowley, please wait. James, unless you can produce empirical evidence in the next ten seconds... - I can. I ask... - A tissue sample? - Well, no. - Blood? DNA? Uh, not exactly. James, what are you... We have the same, very specific penis. It's like the Big Dipper with, um... (SIGHING) Hey, keep your dick in your pants there, James. Edna? I am so sorry for my behaviour yesterday. It was uncouth to say the least. How are the treatments going for the lymphoma? Oh, right! Yeah, you just found out about that last week, you haven't told anybody. Sorry! Hey, spoiler alert though: you kick the crap out of the cancer. Full recovery. Edna. It's me. You don't know me like this, but I know you. I know that your first boyfriend left you for your sister and you haven't spoken to her since, and that your father is a cold-blooded son of a bitch. And that's why you never felt that you had a family, or ever really needed one. Stop! I've never told anyone any of this. No, you haven't and you won't for about nine years. Shall I go on? No! (SOFTLY) No. That's quite enough. My instincts were right about you. Yes, they were. Oh, this is so good, Edna. I'm gonna save you 12 years of frustration and missteps! Untie me. Dr. Rowley, I think you've heard quite enough for one day. We don't have to wait 12 years, James. Your future self can tell us everything we need to know today. - Yes! - Dr. Rowley, this technology, we are going to learn everything that we need to learn and discover ourselves when we're supposed to. I strongly believe that we need to let this run its course here. You need to think bigger, James. Exactly, exactly. You untie me, I'm gonna unlock all the secrets of the universe. Okay. Shh. What is going on? Why did you do that to yourself? Time travel apparently makes you mildly unstable. Another thing we'll need to work out and another reason why we don't wanna rush this process, Dr. Rowley. All you need to worry about and all you need to know is that everything's gonna work out fine here. How do you know? Well, the fact that he is still here assures us that it all works out. Dr. Rowley, we can do this. Your engineering breakthrough with my theoretical work? I mean, the proof is sitting right in front of us. Well, tomorrow should be an interesting day. Tomorrow? I'll announce your promotion and our partnership. Now, what... what do we do about him? I mean, how unstable is he? Oh, he's fine, he's fine. But you really should go. Yeah. I... I-You know what? You should treat yourself to a hotel room tonight. Yeah, don't go home. Go to a hotel, unwind, you know, rest. You got a big day tomorrow. Get off the grid! Don't tell anyone where you're staying, okay, especially not me, and I will see you in the morning. Indeed, you shall. (NERVOUS CHUCKLING) (SIGHING) Okay. I'm gonna untie you, and I'm gonna take that out of your mouth, but you need to listen to me first, okay? This is my life. You had your chance and I am truly sorry that it didn't work out the way that you wanted it to. But this is what I want. Maybe you'll never disappear and that's fine. You can go and live your life the way you want to, now, in the present! And let me live the way I want. (SIGHING) Nod if you understand this. Right. So you... Okay. I'm gonna... Gonna get you out of here. There you go. Right, right. You're not gonna say anything? Nothin' to say. You're on your own. Hey! Hey. Uh... There's somethin' I need to tell you. JIMMY: Courtney. Courtney, come on! Just slow down. Give me a second for God's sake. Time travel?! You've been you this entire time? You travelled through time and you didn't think to tell me the second you figured it out?! I didn't know how to tell ya. (BREATHING HEAVILY) James. How could this possibly be what you end up like? Well, I'm gonna try to take that as a compliment. I... I just can't. ♪ (SIGHING) (SIGHING) I don't know, I don't know. What if you are my future? Like maybe... maybe you do come to CERN with me. Sometimes people meet at the wrong time. Like... maybe I was always supposed to meet you at this age. No. I've seen your future. And believe me, being with a 60-year-old time travelling paradox is... not an upgrade. No, you have so many incredible things that are gonna happen to you. Do you know how long I've been in love with you? I blew it. I blew it so bad. Turns out I'm too stupid... to deserve you. That's why you're gonna go. You're gonna go to CERN on your own, because if you stay here... nothing's gonna change. How come you always say the right thing at just the right time? Because I'm from the future. And I sure as shit got it wrong the first time around. Don't tell me how it ends. Meredith? (PHONE RINGING) (SIGHING) Hello. Hey! You picked up. Thank you. I'm kinda busy, James. Yeah. No, I know. I'm sorry, I won't keep you. I just, uh... I wanted to, um... Tomorrow is Rowley's big press conference, you know, and I know things got weird with us but I really hope that, um... I'm leaving tomorrow. Right. Yeah, of course. No, I know. Uh, what time's your flight? You know, maybe we could just grab... - I'm sorry, I um... - ...a quick breakfast before you go? I have to finish packing. So... Um, another time. Like, maybe you could come back as a version of yourself that has his shit together? I'll take your silence as confirmation that Jimmy wasn't playing a horrible trick on me. (WHISPERING) I really... I really wanted to tell you. I... (SIGHING) (CAR APPROACHING) ROWLEY: Smile, James. Your whole life is about to change. All my other projects are irrelevant, compared to the work that we're about to announce. I'm gonna shut them down. Just close my facility completely. We'll move into a smaller lab. This will afford us enough capital to fund the work for five years. Fi... but we already know that it takes 12 years. (CHUCKLING) No. The first time around it took 12 years, but that's because we didn't know then what we know now, that it works! You'd be surprised, the difference that kind of confidence makes! And tenacity and work ethic. Yes but Dr. Rowley, Jimmy told us that we committed everything to this project. All of our time, all of our efforts. All of our energy. We... It was all we did! So we sank our whole lives into this work, for 12 years. So, we'll double our efforts. Think about it. Neither of us is married. We don't have family or any of the baggage whatsoever. We don't even have a single friend between us. The only person who even remotely paid attention to you is about to get on a plane. There's absolutely nothing stopping us from dedicating every waking moment to this work. Dr. Rowley, it's time. (ENGINE STARTING) Yeah. All right, let's go!
