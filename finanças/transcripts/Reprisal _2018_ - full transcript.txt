Says here that his father was a patrol officer over in midtown. - Did you know him? - No. It was before my time. And he used this guy as a decoy with the others. Well, that's what it looks like. - One fatality? - Yeah, a security guard. But the witness statements indicate that no one saw it coming. All right, get it on the board. I want a BOLO out. The rest of my team will be flying in by tomorrow. Have offices and a task force room set up before they arrive. - You got it. - Excuse me. We've been waiting here for over two hours. I'm looking for my husband, Jacob Tasker. Can you help us? No one seems to know anything. Really sorry, ma'am, but you're gonna have to wait over here for a little while longer, okay? Please. I just need to make sure he's okay. He's fine, Mrs. Tasker. He's in a briefing with one of our top investigators. If you want to wait over there, we'll send someone over as soon as he's finished. - Okay. - Thank you. Is Daddy okay? Mr. Tasker, you hired a private security firm a couple years ago as a consultant? Uh-... Yes, uh... Do you remember the name of the firm? I don't, but it was approved by the board so that we could stay in compliance with federal regulations. We're hoping you can help us here, Mr. Tasker. This is a jewelry store, credit union branch, and a diamond exchange in Aventura, Florida, last spring. Two banks up in Pittsburgh late last August. They all have one thing in common. That's pretty much the description I gave the officers. Any surveillance from our bank? We believe that he's been using what appears to be a Chinese-built scrambler, so it shorts out all wireless devices, including surveillance cameras that are not hardwired. We've reviewed your statement. If there's anything that stood out... we need to know. This happened really fast, and he was violent. Uh-... In tactical gear, head to toe, just like this. I didn't see his face. I didn't see his hands. He didn't speak. He had index cards. He was in and he was out and... and that was it. Was there someone that came into your bank, maybe... a person in the last couple weeks, that seemed irregular in any way? Uh-... No, no, not, uh... nothing that would raise that kind of a red flag for me, no. Hm- It's just that this guy knew your facility inside out. He had to have been there before. He had the precise measurements necessary for that mechanism to work on your doors. He knew the exact location of that locker inside your vault. We know you've been through hell today. This is the third homicide connected to this man. You know, sometimes memories have a way of coming back after an incident like this. If you think of anything, don't hesitate. - Okay. Hi, guys. - Let's get you home. - Take me home. You okay? I'm not okay. Are you okay? Can I get you anything? Hey. No, I'm good. Are you sure? Yeah. I just, uh, I just need a little time. Okay. Stay down. - Looking good. - Hey. Hey. Rough night? Yeah. Couldn't sleep. Yeah, uh... Saw it on the news. Sorry it happened. I can't shake it, man. I just keep seeing it over and over again, you know? I replay it in my head, like... Like I could've done something, maybe, to stop it. Twenty years of law enforcement. And... a lot of bad nights. A pair of these, a couple beers, it'll help. Thanks, pal. I remember holding the hand of this little girl. I pulled her out of a canal. She hadn't been under... She hadn't been under that long. Her mother crashed the car. She kept asking for her. Nothing I could do. You ever wanna talk... I'll be here for you. Thanks, James. I appreciate it. Sorry. Officials are now reporting that one of the victims in yesterday's bank robbery is in critical condition from the injuries sustained during that deadly attack. Hey. How you doing? I'm okay. I think. Any updates? Mm-mm. Nothing new. Guy just disappeared. Vanished. Mitchell called me late last night. They want me to be put on administrative leave until further notice. What does that mean? They're not terminating you, are they? I... I don't know. You gave those people ten years of your life. I know. - They're not gonna do that. - Shh. I know. There's no way, right? Just stick to the routine. Business as usual. We don't need this kid getting more upset, okay? Please, I'm gonna go take a shower. I'm exhausted. - Jack, you gotta help me! - Mr. Connors.

He's a recipient of a Silver Star and a Purple Heart. If you disrespect him in any way, you have to answer to me. Do you understand? Close the door on the way out. It's okay, Dad. Life for a life. Life for a life. Eye for an eye. Are you okay? I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, yeah. I should've done something. There was nothing you could've done. If you had done something, you wouldn't be here right now. I know. Talk to me. I don't know what to say, baby. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to do. I'm right here. I used to live on those things. A couple a night. Takes the dreams away. Then you get to a point when you take so many of 'em... you can't get out of bed without 'em. You know, I haven't had a day off in ten years? I don't know what the fuck to do with myself. I can't even make a move until the feds clear me. They reach out to you at all? Not since the robbery. I told them everything I know, and then they forgot about me. It seemed like they were following that guy for a long time. They knew him. You're talking about a task force? Break it down for me. Come on, right now, while it's fresh. All right, all right. - Spell it out for me. - All right. He was very tactical, right? Full body armor. You see his face? He had a mask. A mask like, you know, what you would wear. A tactical, like SWAT. He say anything to you? No, he didn't say anything to anybody. He had cards written out. He's violent. And he had a lock. He was carrying this big, uh... - FBI said it was some specialized lock. - A lock? Yeah. He put it on the door. - Did you get a look at it? - Yeah, yeah. - What kind of look was it? - It was big. It was like a heavy steel lock. They had to blowtorch it off the door. Describe it to me, the lock. It was big, it was old, it was steel, it was heavy. I don't know how he carried it. A special lock. Yeah, that's what they said. It was big. Rusty? I don't know much. I didn't... It fucking happened so fast. - Lay it out for me. Rectangular, right? - Right. - Like that. - Right, right, right. Hollow in the middle, and it was heavy, and it was very old. Very old. Steel, yeah. I really wanna know what kinda lock you're talking about. Which one is it? I don't see it there. Wait a minute, go up. How do you scroll this? Whoa, whoa, whoa. - This. - That's it? That's the lock. I wanna print that. I wanna see this special lock. No, no. It's right here. If it were exotic, it would be easier to find. I didn't say "exotic." I didn't say "exotic." What I said was "specialized." Special, right? Because everybody doesn't have it, so it's special. Break it down for me. Yeah, see the doors? See exactly what it did? So... if the bank branch is right here... Uh-huh. Where were you when they found you? Right there. I was right there. Yeah, maybe 15 feet from the door. When you turned around, you didn't see your suspect at all? Mm-mm. - No, he was gone. - Where was he? What they're saying, and what had to have happened, is he went out this way. This is crazy. This is the guy. That's your guy? Well, look, it's the same guy for each one of these things. And look at this $75,000 reward. It's going up. Well, I thought you just wanted to clear your name. That's not funny. - What are you laughing about? - I do wanna clear my name. This is crazy. This is the guy. That's why it's taken so long for the FBI to find this guy. I mean, something brought these fucking guys here, right? Well, they're just following a pattern now. He's blending into his surroundings. - Come on, you can see that. - Yeah, of course. Baby, how do you feel this morning? Your numbers are a little low. I need you to drink all of this, okay? And eat all of that. Every bite, okay? We need to get that back up. I need you to keep this away from her. It is away from her. Guns. That. - Okay, all right. - Not papers with the masks. - Shush. It is away from her. - They're everywhere. Listen, I'm doing something here. It's very important. I'm doing my best, okay? Well, it's not good enough for me. Well, what do you want me to do?

Forty dollars an hour should get a few guys out there. Pittsburgh. Aventura. And now here. Three quick heists in the same amount of days. Yeah, there's only a few days between each job, right? Which means it's well planned out, and it's a timing thing for him. It's timing. He's gone, man. He is in the wind. - No way. No way. - He's not coming back. Or there's two jewelry stores downtown. High-end jewelry stores, maybe. You said he went strictly for the cash. Right? Yeah. Okay, guns and cash, right? He can't sell the diamonds. He can't sell the jewelry. He goes for guns and cash, so maybe he's after paper. Maybe he's after money, right? Could be in Florida. Could be in the Bahamas. Could be in Venezuela. Or he could be looking at the Chartoff Bank, which is right downtown. He needs something easy in, easy out. Look where we were. We were 15 feet away from him. He used us as decoys, right? He gets out the back. There's no cameras in the bank's garage. They own the garage in the back. There's no cameras, no surveillance, he's gone. Maybe he's looking for the same thing, same time. It's been three days since he hit that bank. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ He needs a target. Yeah, keep going. What makes sense to you? Well, Federal. No. It's electronic banking. They switched over. There's no tellers. I think East Way Bank, which handles the payroll for the shipping yards, that's a target. ♪ ♪ How easy would it be during a shift change? Hundreds of people coming and going. He'd blend right in. Where are the escape routes? - No, no, wait, wait! Listen to me! - What? What? You're right, you're right.

The only connection in the region is this building that manufactured those things. I gotta be out of my mind. Most departments have already switched over to digital, right?

That's the funny part of the story. See, when the guy was running away from Grandpa, his pants fell down to his ankles, so then Grandpa had to pick up his pants... and handcuff his ankles to his arms, to his... I don't know. It was funny. I miss his stories. Yeah, I miss him. - He had some crazy stories. - But he was a good guy. He was a good guy. He was a good cop. Mm. But he didn't want Daddy to be a cop, ever.
