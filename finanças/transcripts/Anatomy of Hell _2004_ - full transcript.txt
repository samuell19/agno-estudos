A film is an illusion, not reality-fiction or a happening. It is a true work of fiction. For the actress's most intimate scenes, a body double was used. It's not her body, it's an extension of a fictional character. ANATOMY OF HELL Why did you do that? Because I'm a woman. I don't understand. You understand very well. Thanks. Why did you go back down to the toilets? People like you don't look at women. When you touched me, on the stairs-- You touched me, right? So what? It was touching. At first I paid no attention to it. Then I got scared. I was sure of what you did. I was sure of what you did, too. I know why you went to the can! To get sucked, like all men. Dumb bitch! That's what you all do. You're all alike. What do you want to do now? I'll pay you. To what end? To find out. You don't like women. You can look at me. I mean, impartially. What's this about? Just that. Watch me where I'm unwatchable. No need to touch me. Just say what you see. It'll cost you a lot. I'll pay you. That's how the deal was made. First night... Excuse me. You're early. I didn't have time to undress. I'm paid to watch. That's all you can ask me to do. You're right. But I can still hope for more. You didn't say it was an isolated house. I had to take a train, then a cab. That will cost you extra. I'll pay for everything. He'd been tricked into this meeting. It sickens him to be here. He hoped for something new, unexpected, though he knows it won't be. At last. It's about time! Why do you exhibit yourself this way? The fragility of female flesh inspires disgust or brutality. Women depend on one or the other. What should we fear more? Nothingness... or brutality? It takes ages between the offer and the demand. Between the offer and when it's taken up. That's what we call the first deception. Thereafter, nothing flows. It's all fake. Artificial catching up, the clumsiness of hasty brutality... You talk too much. Your words are inept reproaches. Should I have shaved my armpits? It would still show. However much women shave, even if you removed the hair from your crack, you wouldn't be rid of your obscene nature. On the contrary, the skin stays lumpy like the neck of a plucked chicken. Every pore exudes the irritation of pulled hairs, like microscopic sexual swellings. So we can't do a thing about it? No, you can't. It's the depth of this obscenity, its feminine depth, that men who don't like women envy in you, and that those who like you, hate you for. It's not what we see, though when you spread your legs, we're revolted, by the overly bright color, the sloppy, shapeless aspect of your hidden lips... the thinness of their skin. Though... here and there, it's lumpy, a skin that sweats, that oozes, a pestilential skin, like the skin of frogs. Frogs, at least, have the decency of being green, but their thighs, symbolically, can be spread as wide as yours. It's not what we see. Your denial of the obscenity is what frightens us most. Keep going. So I wonder if what first turned me off women wasn't the deep violence they provoke from their slumbering depths. So far, I'd been honest. But you must have an inkling of what I inevitably recall, because thoughts tend to wander. And you can't channel them forever in a course that isn't theirs. You can't deny what those black tufts remind you of, with their shiny putrid hairiness. Ajust-hatched bird, still wet from the egg, so touching in its newborn weakness. Still today, the child, who would become all men, retained his horror of the slime that mocked him. Do you understand? I was learning what I knew, but refused to hear, that the body of women calls for mutilation. And yet no part of it is excessive. Men rant against something that's invisible. It's late, and you still know nothing about women. Why did you go and sit down? Come take a closer look. Isn't that what I pay you for? Know why people drink when they're together? Because they have nothing to say. They hope a bedroom will make things better. It's worse. We drink because there's no communication. Nothing. You speaking for me? Not at all! Man or woman, it makes no difference. When you offer up your perishable flesh, when an opening in the flesh is promised, I lack words and thoughts. I need alcohol. I need to forget that bestiality. That loneliness. Aren't you afraid? No, I control my impatience. The waiting has become part of my pleasure. It's inherent in my demand. Can you understand that? It reminds me of a time when I was still naive and far-removed from sex. The silly local boys, who already went around in a pack, descended on our garden behind the house like a flight of partridges in the hunting season. After a short period of hostilities, since I was the only enemy, beating me wasn't glorious, so we agreed to be friends. To seal the peace, we played doctor. I was the patient, of course. A girl is a man's sickness. So maybe all these budding young doctors, were disgusted forever of the sight of candid little virgin girls. I bless the day I was born immune to you and of all of your kind. The elastic resistance of a boy's anus doesn't lie about the tightness of his lower intestine. The lie about the softness of women is hateful... the malevolent triviality, that turns them into a trap. The horror of Nothingness that is the imprescriptible All. I'm sick of your dallying! You've hardly looked at me. Look at me when I can't see myself. Look at me when I can't see myself! The ocean, despite its misleading male image, rolled in the darkness like a bitch in heat. This ocean, like a woman, could engulf you and make you vanish into its loins. So I felt trapped by a kind of sorcery of the signs and obscene sounds of nature. Surrounded by the pleading moans of the weak, only I was strong, helpless against the whole world. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. It's just the first night. It's the first night. Second night... Last night you wanted to kill me. You fought that urge a long time. How do you know? It's an urge all men have. That's how they are. That's why they lie beside us. The veils they adorn us with ritually, anticipate our shrouds. But you're not part of that. You know nothing of it. You don't know the harm you could do. Third night... Anyone could have come in. Or anything. That's what men can't stand. It's why they've tried to lock women up, in all eras, all places, under every latitude. To protect us from ourselves, they say. To break the spell of women. In fact... they're afraid women don't belong to them. They don't believe in basic freedom. They threaten us with belts, padlocks, their concept of chastity, their foolish morals, since they always need reassurances. Yet they know one can't ask for proof. Or else love has no meaning. I wore it to keep blood off the sheets in your absence. But now that you're here... Pull. Pull. It comes out easily. See, that's all there is to it. Because of this blood, they say we're impure. Sometimes they won't shake our hands. And no intercourse during the period they call our period. In fact, they're scared of this blood that flows without the need of a wound. What they call impurity, I... on the contrary... I can put it in a glass of water, as the aged do their dentures. I watch the haze of red blood spreading in the water... Don't we drink the blood of our enemies? Isn't that what women are to men? Here, drink! We make such a big deal of it. See the space it takes up, and one can't even feel it? The same space as most human penises. Proof that in intercourse the act isn't what matters, but its meaning. I can push it in just like that, to the tip... Without feeling anything, no sensation of pleasure at all. A very ordinary gesture. Look. There's a whole device to make it look complex. So one can insert it without touching oneself, keeping one's virginity intact. Without exploring one's genitals. You insert the tip of the cardboard, push on it like a syringe to inject yourself like... shooting up into your veins, only feeling the hygiene of the absorbent cotton. As if to staunch a wound that is painful and highly sensitive. I don't feel a thing. Nothing! Isn't that laughable? I'd gladly laugh, but it foretells of something terrifying. Something terrifying had to lurk in the brain of whoever designed, and put his servile signature on this infamous thing! A man, for sure. Who feels superior and protective. Who doesn't like us. In fact, men never understood who we are. They fear us, like kids who are afraid of the dark. Tell me. Did I lose all my dignity doing that in front of you? Tell me! Fourth night... See anything? You can't see anything, right? I can hide it inside me, for as long as I want. I can also make it come out when I want. You don't like us replacing you. No. Yes. Everything you see there is non-existent. The only thing that gives me pleasure is the movement of your hand, as you put the stone dildo back inside me. Because, you see, you see... It's beautiful, you look like you're bleeding. You're afraid because you think you're bleeding, even though you know you're not. This hemorrhage is from the fertile blood of women. You worry that I may have cursed you, ruined your penis for life. Right. When you stick it into a man, sometimes it must come out soiled. You're not angry at them. You're not sad or afraid. Sometimes it happens. But fecal matter is inert. It has been through the life-cycle. In that, it's like human nature. Man can't give life. He takes it. He gives death. And so gives eternal life. As I left, she slipped me the money I had earned. By keeping the money, I exited from the myth. I lost her. I knew it at once. But in fact, I'd been caught off guard, and took the money when I wanted to refuse it. Paul! Same again, please. Make that two. Another for him, too. Don't think about it anymore. Forget it. She was a bitch. A slut, like any other. Yes, but the queen of sluts. I reamed her pussy so hard, no one will want her again! You're right. You have to hump 'em like goats! Like goats! As many as you can! So you're immunized against them all. If you let one get under your skin, you're fucked, you're done for! But she took everything! Get it? She took all I had. You can get drunk. She can't take that. They can't take that away. They can't, get it? I made her crap her shit and wallow in her piss... That slut! She was a pigsty by the time I left. A human being wouldn't let anyone use her as I did. But she always wanted more! She wanted more! She wanted more and more! I should've ripped her guts out and made her eat them! You're right. You're right. Drink! I don't even know her name. I really knew her. I experienced total intimacy with her. And I don't even know her name. I don't need this. Neither do I. I refused to believe that what she gave me, was mine now, and I could draw on it for my existence. I wanted to start all over again, from the very beginning. This time fully aware of what I was doing. I didn't want to admit that life isn't like that, that nothing can be done all over again.
