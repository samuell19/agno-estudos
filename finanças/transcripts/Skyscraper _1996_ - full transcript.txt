TOWER DANGER Tower, this is Rocket 1 Charlie. Anyone listening? Rocket 1 Charlie, you can talk. I'm leaving your airspace. Destination: Downtown Los Angeles. Exchange. Everything indicates that you will have a smooth trip. See you next time. Have a good trip, Carrie. -Security. -Heliscort pilot. I request permission to land. Affirmative. Released for landing. We were waiting. -Hi good morning. 724 Spring Street. I have a landing permit. Quick, I'm late. Yes sir. Los Angeles Tower. This is Rocket 1 Charlie. Rocket 1 Charlie. I'm listening. I'm heading east, leaving your airspace. - Bad traffic in 2 hours. - Understood, Los Angeles Tower. Thank you for flying with Heliscort. We hope to see you soon. This is Rocket 1 Charlie. Where are you, handsome? I'm going, I'm going, I'm going! Rocket 1 Charlie. Wake up, Chuancey. -OK. I'm going. What happened? -I finished my job. I'm going home. Until my next call, you can reach me at the beep. OK. But remember to take the beep this time. US GOVERNMENT -Mr. Booker, how's Zitex going? -Good. How was your flight? It was great. Come on, public places make me nervous. Daylight makes you nervous. It is not every day that something that can affect the... balance of power on the planet. When did we receive the other piece? -As soon as Uncle Sam pays for this. -Right. Thank you, Mr. Booker. Go! Get out of here! Will soon! Caution! Come on, let's go! Back! -Not another step! -Ah, my noble opponent. In what ungrateful circumstances we find ourselves in. -You know I can't give you this. -But you have no choice. Bye, Belo. Against the wall and open your legs. I do what I want, detective. Damn it. Damn it. Not again. Yeah, I don't believe it. Look, I'm sorry. It must be important. I asked them not to disturb you. It's Wink. OK. Okay, okay. I'm going. I'm sorry, darling. But I have to go. -To where? -Do not know. Something important in the center. A shooting in an alley. I'm not sure. Did you see? That's why you don't want to have a baby. He's married to the Police Department, not me. This is not true. It's unbelievable. I love you, but I was a cop when we got married. We're going to have a baby, but we have to wait for the right time. Gordie, you lied to me. -Carrie, it's not fair. I did not lie. -Liar. We don't have time for a baby. You work during the day, and I work at night. I already said I’ll stop flying for a year. You make excuses. Do you really want to put a baby in this world? While you spend the day in the clouds, I stay on the floor watching all kinds of madness. We seem to be on an express train to Hell at 250km per hour! Sorry for still believing in a walk in the park and innocent children. Carrie dear, sorry, but I can't change how I feel. It's all right. Go. Okay. Damn it! Forgot it! Jimmy brought me. My car is still at the station. Honey, can you give me a ride, please? With pleasure. Calm down! Oh my! That was too close! I'm glad you don't fly like you do, or I would be in trouble. If so, we wouldn't be talking. Listen, I'm not ready to be a father. We waited another year and talked. I do not want to talk about this anymore. Honey, I feel that way. Why don't you understand? -Because I want a baby. -Carrie, forget it. Right? -Have to go now. -It's all right. Go! Goodbye! Rocket 1, Rocket 1 Charlie. Are you listening? - This is Rocket 1 Charlie. -I got you a client... at the Hotel Nova Otony. He will give the destination when they are in the air. -Good morning to you too, Chauncey. -And for you too, Carrie. Happy now? Listen, this guy has a lot of money. 4 hours guaranteed, maybe even longer. VIP treatment all the time. Only one guard is missing. I can't lie. I was eating my goat. Then the policeman says: "There's more to that, right, Farmer Brown?" Enfão says the Farmer: "After eating the goat, she turned and licked my balls." Then the judge turns to the farmer and says: "Hey, that bitch is a good one." That goat... I don't believe it, Gordie. They all died laughing in the morning. -You are sick, sick. -Unity in the area of ​​Rua Balboo. -141 in progress. - It's close here. So let's go deep. It's Unit 12, we're on our way. A more beautiful pilot than usual. Do you have a problem with female pilots? When the world of men was not maintained despite his oratory... the goodness of women reigned. -Henrique IV. -IS. I already feel in good hands. What is our destiny? A 4th skyscraper with Grant in Long Beach. -Address, please. -Why do you want the address? I have to go through the radio. It's the rules. Grant, 1416. -I'm tired, very tired. -I have another one. - I don't want to hear it. -Is about... Stay quiet. -Are you sure? -Have. Jimmy, look at that. It's open. Ah, damn it! -Get back in the car. Ask for reinforcement. -Right. This way. The chip is right here. Very good. It is. Great. We have company. -Who are you? -Zorkov! Scream again. Go on, put the handcuffs on. Officer asking for backup. They're shooting. Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy... Jimmy, get out... Jimmy! Jimmy, no! Wait for us. -Mr. Fairfax. Glad you came. - It was a pleasure, Mr. Simpson. -A pleasure. -How about joining me and the guests? -Sorry, sir. We are late. -Thank you for remembering, my friend. You're welcome. Another time, another place. Perhaps, Mr. Simpson. But at the moment, business is my priority. As you wish. Come this way. I don't say anything else until my lawyer arrives. If you don't speak, push your teeth so deep in your throat that will come out through the ass. You have no courage. Not that sissy partner of yours. You bastard! I'll send you to hell! Gordon! Gordon, it's not worth it. Gordon. I know how you feel. Jimmy was quite a guy. Jimmy was more than a partner. It was like a brother. And I'm not called Gordon anymore if I let that killer get away from this one. You must be calm. Do your work. Gordon... I'm sorry about Jimmy. He will be missed. Thanks. Have you heard from Interpol yet? Only with someone with Delta 4 access, we will know something. -Delta 4? -IS. -So you're not a chicken thief! - You must have already worked for the CIA. And the company Zitex? Did you talk to them? Yes. They stole an instrumental silicon carbide platform. -And what is this? -It has to do with targeting... and satellite monitoring. But it comes in four pieces that fit together. Look at that. -And he only has one piece. -Yes. Without the other three, it is harmless. Thank you, Jim. Can go. Two of my men died. I was supposed to charge 100 million more. A small price for infinite power, Mr. Simpson. Glad you think so. It's ok? Perfect. We're halfway there. But as for you, Mr. Simpson... -What is it?... has already reached its destination. Welcome, my love. Good night my Prince. Come on, we're late. -How was the meeting? -An overwhelming success. -What's our next destination? -Zitex company, in the center. Why call me on Saturday? I had a date with a beautiful blonde. That's right, Dirty Harry. If it's not Dudley Wright, the Mount Policeman. What's up? Herby... My name is Dudley Wright's official to you. Do not move... or I stick a bullet so deep in your ass that you will spit it out of your mouth. Wait until I get my badge. -Good morning, Ralph. Mike? -Good morning, Mr. Pollard. - Working overtime? - Running after the injury. -Where you go? -No 600. I'll be there at 600. Mr. Drake's office? Yes, I have to install new software on his computer. See you later. Hello? It's Wright. I'm going to do my round. Okay, go ahead. Calling the Base. This is Rocket 1 Charlie. Anyone listening? Anyone listening? -Is anyone there? -Some problem? I lost contact. My radio doesn't work. Sorry, we have to land. No way, I'm already late! The building is not far. Just get closer. We are allowed to land. Wait for us here. Let's call your base. Ah, damn... Au revoir... Mr. Charile Drake... Hi... Hi. -Do you mind if I use the phone? -Imagina. But use the outside. -Thanks. -Be brief. I have a lot of work. -Thanks. -And close the door when you leave. Of course. Look. Whoever has a badge will appear in the position. Whoever is not, is monitored by the heat sensitive laser system. -Hello. -Hello. Chauncey? -Hi, Carrie. What's it? -The antenna broke. -I don't know how, but it broke. -Damn it. Stay still. I'll take care of the phones first. -Hello? Hello? -Hello? Hello? Then we lock the entire building. No one enters or leaves without our permission. Come on, come on, quick. OK, let's go. Hurry up. ACCESS ALLOWED ABLE Our package just arrived. He's got the suitcase. But the two are armed. You know I don't trust these bastards. - Cover the lab. -Yes, sir. - This is Mr. Cranston. -How are you? Skip the formalities. Where's Fairfax? That. Cranston! Nice seeing you again! Comment are you, monsieur? Çaa va? -Très bien. -Good that you accepted my proposal. If I am going to sell my soul to the devil, I must speak to himself in person. Thanks for the compliment, but I'm just a man, and if you hurt me... -I'm able to bleed. -Hey, theatrical phrases? Let's get on with it, okay? Do you have the other three pieces? -Yes I have. -Great. Ah yes... And now... the second stage. The money. Money is the root of all evil. You bastard... Ah, Mr. Cranston, I am still seeing you. Okay, guys, he's taking the elevator. He just got off on the 20th floor. -Damn it! Who are you? - I'm a helicopter pilot. -What happened? -I i i... -Watch out! -Quickly! I have to stop them... I have to stop them... -Right. What is going on? -They'll kill us to have this suitcase. Attention, attention! They are going to the ceiling. I can not take it anymore... What the hell! I cover, and you disappear with it. Go! Go! The end of life cancels all ties. -You're going to be screwed... -Later, darling. Goodbye. Damn it... Damn it. Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! Find the bitch. Oh my! Hey, Ralph. There are two corpses on monitor 7. Ralph? Raph? Oh my God... We're going bad, friends. They're making a mess. There are people all over the building. Hurry up, join the others or we'll never find that bitch. -Sure there. -Thank you. Hey, Billy Ray, watch out. -Bi-bi bi-bi! I want to pass. -What bi-bi-bi... Mr. Drake? -What happened to you? - They want to kill me. Stay here, I'll call security. We have activity in the elevator and... well well. Look at that. It's our friend, Rocket Charlie. -Come on, get in here quickly. -Hey, take it easy, doll. - We have all afternoon. -Shut up. Do you like the strong, quiet type? I can do that. Look, why don't you and I stay a little longer... Ah, I like these... She is with a friend. Stop the elevator. What is going on? They stopped on the 23rd floor. Look at me. We will get out of here. Is good? -Let's go. Wake up, man! -I'm not breathing. No, no... Damn it. - Check the front. -Right. What unbearable heat. Wow... ugly fall. -Beautiful clock. -I'm not worried about that. -Have you heard from the snipers? -I had. Clever. -Foreigners. Professionals. -What the hell. -Do you know how to get to the ceiling? -Of course I know. Follow me. -It looks like no one was here. -Well, let's check. I'll call the District. Clancy, it's Gordie. -Have you heard from that scoundrel? -Wow! Gordie, where have you been? Bad news. -Someone got him. -How did you get it ?! - He's been dead for two hours. - Damn it! -Clancy, any news from Gordie? -If it were you, I would come here. The captain is a beast. He's crazy looking for you. Hey! Any news? -Tell him that I'm coming. -That's cool, I say. -Where did you find that? -Right here. -Heliscort. -Chauncey, it's Gordie. -How are you? - Has Carrie called there yet? He called from a phone booth. He said he had a radio problem. Then the connection dropped ... I don't know, it disappeared. What do you mean, disappeared? Where was her last stop? In Long Beach, I already checked. She is not there. I'm here, on the ceiling. There's a body in the pool. I have a bad feeling. If you're going to shoot, the lock is here. You don't have to squeeze. Just touch. Okay? And fire! Not bad, huh? Okay, your turn. Remember what I said. Do you remember that I'm from Mahia, Texas? Mahia, Texas? -There are things you do well. -IS? What for example? That. Okay. Come on. There are only eleven heliports in Los Angeles. She has to be in one of them. Check all the other floors. You must catch this piranha now! -Take it easy. -Shut up. This man wants to tell you something. Looking for the pretty blonde in overalls? -I am. -Well, I know where she is. If I tell you, you let me go. -Right? -Right. Zorkov, Zorkov... You are losing sight. -Stop! Do not move! -Stop it! You... you're one of them, aren't you? Do I look like a killer to you? -Yes... it could be. -Ah, give me that! You can't do that. -The revolver isn't even loaded. -You can shoot. My insurance is partial. It has activity on the stairs on the 23rd floor. Leidermeier, take care of that. We need to hide. Do you know where? Know. Know. Come on. Between here. Around. Here inside. Give me the bullets. Okay, let's go. I think it's better if I cover you from here, right? Time to die, you blonde piranha. I got it. Got it! Leidermeier? Leidermeier? Leidermeier? I think we lost Leidermeier. There! Her helicopter! Go back to the District. -Wow! They have hostages! -We have to act. - We can't leave them there. -I know but... -Ah, damn it! -What's it? They activated the emergency system. All exits are locked. Okay, I'm looking for a way out. I won't be standing here. Fine. Be careful out there, huh? You too, sniper. There is an intruder alert on the top floor, in the stairwell. It can't be her. It's the police. Mom! Mom? Where are you? Mom! Mom! Where are you? Mom! -Are you alright? -I'm afraid. I want my mother. Your mom will be fine. Comes. Let's go. Let's stay here. It's all right. Okay. They're not here. Let's go. Is right. -What's your name? -Billy Ray Johnson. Well, Billy Ray, I'm going to look for your mom and I want you to stay here. Right? I don't want to be alone. Connect the communication. I don't have time for games. return the suitcase to me. And by the way... I have enough hostages for about an hour. Thank you. I'll find a safer floor for you to hide, okay? -Hello? - I have the suitcase. Do you want it? I want. -Are you Rocket 1 Charlie? -Exactly. And I want to make a deal. You release the hostages and I tell you where I hid the suitcase. How will I know you won't lie? I know. I surrender. So you remain a hostage. Combined. -So where are you? - I'm where it's hot. Oh shit! We have a fire on the 7th floor. Fairfax, you have an appointment with a pilot on the 7th floor. FIRE ALARM Damn it! Hakim, put out the fire in the west wing of the 7th floor. Damn, now we're going to have visitors. Well if it's not Rocket 1 Charlie. Okay, I'll get out of here. Deal is deal, isn't it? You bastard! You know? This is what is wrong with society. Women like you. Can you believe that? Technically, sir. You didn't deliver it. I found it. Wait. For. I embezzled hundreds of thousands of dollars. And I can share everything with you. And now he wants me as a partner! Better yet, it's all yours. It is worse than the plague when thieves are not honest... with each other. Not! Now it's up to you. If you have any hope of staying alive... tell me where the suitcase is. -Let the hostages go, and then I say. It is not in a position to make demands. This building is huge. It will take months to find the suitcase. Natasha, I could kill one of the precious hostages of Mrs. Wink? -Not! -With pleasure. - Do you want us to execute another one? -Not! I hand over the briefcase. Go around! More this now? The entire Fire Department appeared! Natasha, roll out the red carpet. -I swear I was here. -Lie. -Let's erase it soon. -I don't have time for games. I swear I was here. Maybe it's on another floor. Take her inside. You can have fun with it. You come with me. With pleasure. Only let's play a little, first. Let's go! What the hell! It's Captain Wood. We have a code 3 situation. Send SWAT, Paramedics, and crowd control unit. Now. This is not a good thing. It's... it's not good. It might be better to abort, Fairfax. Nobody leaves this skyscraper until I have what I came for. Hello my friend. -Did anyone call the feds? -Take that car around the corner! Captain? Wayne Deleski. I drew Simon 588. The computerized operation system that controls the building. My work. Okay, Wayne, how did we get in there? I can? -My God, this is not good. -What? I designed the building to withstand civil wars, military attacks... and things like that. The builders were South Africans. They were happy with the completed work. That's why they paid me so well. Okay, you millionaire, how did we get in there? Well, they are basically lost. -God was very generous to you. -Look what you're missing. You know? I usually prefer to give the girls a drink first. So I'm sorry if we don't have time for foreplay. It doesn't sound that bad to me. Attention! It's the Los Angeles Police! Open the lobby doors or we will force the entrance. I repeat, open the lobby doors! We are from the Democratic People's Liberation Party. We have 17 hostages and we will kill them all... if they provoke us. We want honesty, democracy... and the old American dream. The government is bad. We are willing to die... because of us. There is a key that turns off the computer, connected to four wires. By cutting them, I connect a plate to the lines, I cancel the command center, and open the building from here. Theoretically... That, sweetheart. -That's it, girl. Relax and have fun. -Ah, this is what I want. You will see what a real man is. Good girl. It will be delicious, very delicious. Marriage at gunpoint? No, no, girl. Damn piranha! -You want me? -Come on, shoot me. -Screw U. -Go you. - It's Johnny Hill. - May this be an example. If they try any kind of rescue, or aggression against us... we will throw another hostage for you. The Liberation Party will not be intimidated... with your bureaucracy. So what I mean, captain, is: no... mess with me! Damn it! Ah, damn it! Let's go! Curse! We can not stop! Let's go! My leg! Damn it! There you are! Please please! Au revoir. Great. Interpol again. South African Command. South African? What an irony. IQ 175, graduated from Oxford, ex-SAS, leader of death squads in Angola, Bosnia and Namibia. What is this bastard wanting? But why did you choose my skyscraper? -I didn't see any silver suitcases. -So look again. Okay, fine. I didn't say I was black, did I? Wow! What is it? -Where is from? From the east? -Not exactly. -So where are you from? -From hell. Turn around. Fuck you, assholes. Zorkov, the policeman is in the basement. Take care of him. -Gordie, dear. Are you alright? -Hi doll. I was looking for you. And me looking for you. Now I have to go. I have to see the hostages. - Hostages? -Yeah, hostages. Look... I love you. What are you doing here? We were going to meet on the ceiling. Change in plans. I know. That piranha got in the way. In fact, it simplified things. In fact, poor Jacques. I wanted you well. Leaving is a sweet sadness. - Drop the gun! -Kiss my ass! Does anyone know how to disarm the computer system? -I know. -I can help, too. Come with me. -Oh, my God... -Don't worry, it's one of them. Ah well. Oh my! There's a child lost in the building! -I'll pick him up. -Do not wait! Come back here! Try system 5. Come on, come on. Is having fun? PERMITTED ACCESS ENABLED We did it. We did it. We did it! C'mon C'mon! They're going to the ceiling. -I do not want to go. -Shut up. I want my mom! Wink, how good of you to join us. We are ready to go. In between. Please. In between. -Get in the helicopter now! -Only after I release the boy. -Let her go! -Gordie, wait! -No one has to get hurt. -I have a nervous finger... -and short patience! -Look, I'll make a deal with you. Let the boy get to Gordie and take you wherever you want. I don't like children. I prefer to play with you. Go to Gordie. Come on. There has never been a history of greater misfortune than Juliet's. And Romeo! Gordie! Not! -Keep everyone away. -We need space. Don't come close. This is Judy Lang, on the news duty. I'm live on Zitex. Less than an hour ago the hostages were saved from a group... probably terrorist. We await more details. Check it out at 11am. -Are you alright? -Yes, I am. Sit here. Calmly. That. It's all right. Saw? Didn't I say it was going to be okay? Now give me a kiss. -Look who's there! -Look what I brought you. -CD! -Wow! Look at that. And look who's there. It's your mother, dear. -You may come in. -You can go up. Let's go. Gordie. His luck was that his wife was there. Oh yes. Thank you. He doesn't think I can handle a son. I give up, I give up. Hey, that's enough. The two get in there now. Let's go. -Help me here, please. -Be careful. There, they entered. Okay, the show is over. Everyone stay away. C'mon C'mon.
