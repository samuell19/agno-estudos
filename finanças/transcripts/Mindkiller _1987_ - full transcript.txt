You haven't come out in weeks and that horrible... Have you been killing hamsters in there again? - Don't! Just slide it under the door! Slide it under the door! Mother, please! I'm working! I need solitude! (whirring) Oh my God! Oh no! Oh, what the hell! (beeping) (screaming) (whirring) (squishing) (gentle piano music) - [Rex] Hi, I'm Rex Hunter. (phone ringing) And to look at me (clattering) you never would've guessed... (tape scrambling) - [Larry] Uh, I honestly don't think we should take off this evening... - Oh, come on, where... - [Larry] Western history references and reports are due on Monday. In any event, I'll call back later. (dial tone) (gentle piano music) - Hi, I'm Rex Hunter, and to look at me you never would've guessed that I had trouble meeting women. Well, they sure aren't a problem now. - That's easy for you to say. - But there was a time in my life when my black book was empty. No more. I used to be just like you, until I learned the Manly Art of Seduction. Now you can, too. There are six easy steps to becoming a man. Let's start with number one, the look. Obviously the first thing that attracts a woman is your appearance and your appearance should say, "I'm good, I'm damn good!" Assume a confident attitude. Try a rakish grin, it gives that hint of danger. Your pose mean a lot to your appearance and to the art of seduction. You should take your example from the birds, especially the peacock. - Hello? - Bickett? Tell Townsend to shove those history reports! - [Larry] What? I can't do that, Warren, I'd be fired! - Sure you can, you're good at that. - [Larry] No, Warren, I don't think we should go out tonight. - I don't wanna hear it. Eight p.m., Swingles. - [Rex] How you smell is also... - Ladies night. - [Rex] You need to smell like a man, so when choosing...

She's not my type. ♪ From the way they check you out ♪ ♪ Think you know what this game's all about ♪ ♪ In your eyes ♪ The look of passion ♪ There is more to it than this ♪ - I've been watching you... ♪ Love is more than one emotion ♪ - [Larry] Well, I guess the drinks were on her, huh? - Shut up.

He walks, he talks, he's a human computer. Really, they should've posted the entire archives through you, would save a lot of paper. Hey, that's a nice jacket. - I didn't think you'd mind. I was going to ask. ♪ You push the end for me - Well, then, what do you say we go get something to eat? - Hi, I thought that was you.

He's a professional wrestler. - Charming. It adds a lot to the room. - Well, you know, I learned all my moves from him. Like the sleeper hold. (both giggling) Not that I want you to fall asleep or anything. - That's good to know. (kissing) (romantic music) (clicking) - [Rex] Now you can too. There are six easy steps to becoming a man. Let's start with number one, the look. - How can he listen to that? This will only take about three hours. (woman laughing) - [Rex] And your appearance should say, "I'm good, I'm damn good." - Get on my knees for you. (kissing) (gentle music) This way. (kissing) This way. - I can't believe he used you to bag her! (eerie music) Just be yourself, Warren, that's all you've gotta do. (shattering) - [Brad] What's goin' on out there? Is everything okay? - Everything's fine. (ticking) - [Brad] Whatcha doin'? - She left over an hour ago, didn't you hear her knockin' around in the kitchen? Boy, she must've really wore you out last night. - Why're you throwin' these away? Here, I'll give you a hand. Whoa! (thudding) - I got you in a sleeper hold. Not that I want you to be asleep. - You're so funny. Really, what else did you hear, asshole? - I got the whole thing on videotape, get your library card ready if you want a copy. - You didn't learn too much from your old man, did you? - I learned how to fake a fall, smartass. So you gonna ask her out again? - I don't know, maybe. She mentioned you tried talking to her last night. - These are all going back. Say, what do you think the overdue charges on all these would be? - I'm really glad you're finally getting rid of all this stuff. Really, doesn't anybody ever wonder what happened to these? You know, maybe she didn't wanna talk to the guy you were trying to be. - Women aren't worth it. - Speak for yourself, jerk. Come on, Warren, you're not gonna learn how to meet women by reading a bunch of stupid books. Use your head, just be yourself! - I've been myself all my life and even I don't like me. It works for you 'cause you're good-looking, otherwise you'd be in the same boat as me. Look at this mess! - Well, Warren, I like you. Really, and someday some woman's gonna come along that sees in your the same things I do and... - And she'll be the one to help me get dates. - (scoffing) Right. (whirring) - Say good-bye, Larry. - No, no, not her, please! We'll hang it over here behind your head where you can't see her, please. Oh. Mona, what'll I ever do without you? How will I ever survive this place without you? Oh! - If I can interrupt your research here for a moment, I have someone for you to meet. This is Sandy Crawford, the library's new consultant. She's been appointed by the mayor to reorganize certain library systems. It seems things aren't as efficient as they might be. - Nice to meet you. - This is McDaniels and Bickett, they're in charge of the subbasement archives. - Well, it looks like that is where we start. I'm looking forward to working with you. - You are? - [Announcer] And that's the extra point as the clock runs out and here we are! This is the first time these two teams have ever been in overtime. (Warren groaning) Waiting at the goal line. There's the whistle and... - I thought you were through with women. - She's no woman, she's a goddess! - Now remember, just be yourself. - Be myself, I know, but I don't know myself, you tell me! - Do we have to do this right now? The game's in overtime! - Come on! Who cares about a bunch of steroid-infested yolos passin' a ball between each other's legs? This is much more important, this is my life! - Yeah, well you tell that to 21 million sports fans! - [Announcer] The officials around him and time out is signaled! - There's a time out, let's make it quick! - So what are some of the things you like about me? - Not much right now, Warren? - Come on, be serious! - All right, what do I like about you? You're honest, you're funny, and you pay the rent on time. - So you think if I do something honest and funny... - Look, look, this is crazy! Just be yourself instead of being... - Terrified? - Yeah. I mean, show her first you're interested in who she is, you know, ask her where she's from, what she likes to do. - Yeah! And then once I know what she likes to do, then I can ask her to do that out on a date! - That's a good idea! See, no problem, now can I just get back to the game? - Thanks, Brad, I really appreciate you helping me out with this! (cheering on TV) - [Announcer] Fantastic turn of events! The most incredible finish to any championship game we have broadcast! - My God, she's beautiful. (eerie music) (Warren gagging) Just six easy steps. (whirring) (knocking) Hi. - Hi, what's up? - Well, this isn't an official visit or anything, I just thought that since you're new here I'd let you know that I'll help you in any way that I can, to make things easier for you. - That's really sweet of you. - [Warren] So is there anything you need help with? - Just this silly little puzzle. - (laughing) So what're your interests? I mean, is there anything that, uh, you feel strongly about? - I don't quite... Oh, I don't know, I like my work. - Me too, maybe we could get together and... You like movies? - Yes, but I don't usually get to see too many 'cause I'm so busy with my work. - Really? We're very much alike that way. Sometimes I think people like us should relax more, enjoy the present. Who knows, we might be dead tomorrow! So you wanna see a movie? - I kind of have a policy not to date anyone I work with. - Oh. I can understand that. If you just twist this side counter-clockwise like this. Whoops. - (laughing) That's okay, I was just... - It's par for the course. (eerie music) (phone ringing) - Archives. - Hello, this is Marlon Perkins with the city zoo. We need to know the gestation period of the wombat. - 16 weeks. The longest known gestation was 17 weeks, three days. - It's me, wombat face. Is Warren there? - Oh, he's not here. Oh yeah he is, it's your roommate. - Yeah? - Hey Warren, it's me. What do you say we get together after work and get a couple of drinks, I've been thinking... - No! No, I don't think so. Listen, I can't talk right now. - Well, what's up? Wow, Warren, you're making this girl too big a deal! - I said I can't talk now! (Larry howling) (rattling) (tense music) Total Mind Control? "The human mind, man's most powerful instrument.

"The following exercises constructs a person's brain "to develop its total capabilities "and can challenge one to make it grow even beyond that! "It begins with trust. "The first step is concentration. "I begin by putting my watch to my ear..." - Oh, hi, Warren! I was just thinking about you. - What were you thinking? Listen, this isn't an official visit, I just thought that since you're new here that I might show you the ropes. - The ropes? That sounds exciting. Warren. I can tell a fella like you has an inquisitive mind. And a mind is a terrible thing to waste. (kissing) (clattering) Come on, Warren, let's do some research! Oh, Warren! Warren, you're good! You're damn good! - [Larry] You're here early today. - I never left. It's amazing, it's eight a.m.! This is incredible! I'm a changed man! I can't explain it. - I've read those mind control articles, they don't work. - You can't have seen this one, this one unlocks some amazing secrets. My God, I have been up all night reading it and I'm not even tired, this is incredible! It was written by this guy named Mr. Vivac Chandra. - Oh, he's a local guy, a research psychologist. Let me see, in 1957 he died some kind of horrible death. People say he was killed by one of his creations. - The man was a genius! I've got some ideas about our department. God, this is so good! - Hey, did you do this? - I guess I did. Look, I made some notes and left them on your desk. Come on, you start here, I'll start over there. Come on, I'll race ya! No, it won't take all week! - Hey, how'd you know I was gonna... - Come on, the day is young, we can get it done by Tuesday. We'll start with the files! (phone ringing) - Archives. - Is there some reason I haven't received that information on the prior organization of the city's charter? - It's Townsend. We put those in your box this morning. - Oh, oh. So you did. Now what's holding you up on the western history references? - We got those in two days ago. - Oh, and would you mind letting me in on where they might be? - We gave them to Sandy, uh, Ms. Crawford. - That doesn't help me, now does it? I'm still your director and you still answer to me! I expect them on my desk ASAP! (dial tone) - I... Oh. (eerie music) This is easy, no wonder you got it. - Look at what we've accomplished. This place looks incredible! I've got some ideas for Sandy's department, too. God, I have got so many ideas! Let me buy you a candy bar. (whirring) (clattering) - Damn, it figures! - Just a second. (thudding) - You know, this job is not as simple as I thought it was gonna be. - Well, you've already made a big difference around here, things are a lot better! That's not just my opinion, everybody says so. - Thanks, that was nice. (clattering) - [Danielle] Hi, Brad, this is Danielle. It's been two long since I've seen you, I really miss your touch. - [Woman] Hi Brad, just called to say hi! Hope to hear from your soon, Brad. - Mm, what's for dinner? Boil-and-serve stew again? - How about chicken dijon, wild rice, and baby carrots. - Well, I was hoping for full-grown adults but I guess I'll have to deal with that. How did you do this? - [Warren] Concentration. - [Woman] You'll need something to wear. - Have a bite? - I've set up appointments with some of his favorite tailors. Call me. - God, this is great! So what's been goin' on with you the past few days? - I've turned over a new leaf. - Really? Does this have anything to do with that talk we had the other day? - As a matter of fact, no. Been reading this new manuscript. - Here we go again, another article. - But this one's working. - Another one that's working, wonderful. - Listen, you ever see me do anything like this before? - All right, let me guess, the name of this manuscript is, How to Fatten Up Women? (Warren chuckling) - Would you get that? It's probably for you. - Get what? (phone ringing) Okay. Hello? - [Woman] Is this my Hulk Champion wrestler? - Yeah, yes, this is your Hulk Champion wrestler.

Where do they keep the extra light bulbs? - It was freezing! - All right, I'm sorry. What's the number to maintenance? - Oh, that sounded sincere. - Larry, would you have thought of me if that was happening to you? - That's completely hypothetical and you know it! They steal all the supplies the minute they come in, you know that. - Larry, I'm sorry. I'll never leave you stranded again, I promise.

I'd love to talk to you about that. Maybe we could get together and discuss it over dinner sometime next week. - Warren, I've already explained to you how I feel about that. - If that's the way you feel. - Please try to understand, Warren. Why don't we just discuss those things now? - I don't think so! (eerie music) (Warren panting) What is going wrong here? Why didn't it work? - You're not paid to loiter, Mr. Bickett, I believe your office and your work is downstairs! You have no business coming up here, especially in those clothes! Do you want the public to think that city library employees can come to work just wearing anything? - I've always felt that appearance is the cornerstone of efficiency.

Can I get you something? Some coffee, some water? - Brad, I don't know what's happening to me! It's just that since I met Warren... - I know. I know. See, I don't get it. See, he's changed, too. You know, he never had a girlfriend before he met you. The only thing that kept him going were all those self-help books. - He scares me, Brad! I don't even like Warren! And yet for some reason I can't control myself. It's like he... - Has control over you. - Yes, (sobbing) yes. (tense music) (whooshing) - I thought we discussed this. When you apologize about something, it usually means that you aren't going to do it again. - Yeah, but I wasn't sorry in the first place. That was you talking, wasn't it, Warren? - What're you talking about, Brad? - I'm talking about Total Mind Control. See, you made me go in there and say I was sorry. Those were you thoughts, not mine. - You've really flipped, Brad. You just can't stand that I've got something better than you. You can't stand it that I've got Sandy. - Yeah, I can't stand it that you've got Sandy because you're making her do something totally against what she wants... - Liar! You just want me to be the same nothing I always was so that you can feel secure again! Well, I've discovered - Don't piss me off, Warren! - The real me and no one, especially not you, can contain me! Do you understand? (Warren yelping) (dramatic music) I hate you! (coyotes howling) - You're good, Larry, you're damn good! (Larry howling) (knocking) - Hey. - Hey, Brad. Come on in. Gosh, what're you doing here? - Look, I want you to meet a friend of mine. Louise, this is Brad, one of my best friends. - Hi. - No, in fact, my best friend. (Louise giggling) Jeez, how long have we known each other? - Look, Bickett, can we talk, alone? - Sure. - Thanks. - So what's up? - It's about Warren. What happened to your hand? - I'm not sure. - Don't screw around with me, Bickett. (Larry howling) - Look, I was just there, I don't know how it happened. - What happened? - There was no logic to it, we were sitting around talking and then the next thing I knew, there was blood all over every, I can't about it, it makes me... Look, I got a date. Me, a date! Give me a break, okay? - For Christ's sake, Bickett, Warren needs our help. - What're you talking about? - I'm talking about what you're talking about. Warren did that to your hand. - No. No, Warren, he's my friend, he wouldn't... - So, how's married life? - Oh, nothin' much has changed, except now he doesn't open up doors for me anymore. Well, see ya on Monday. - Oh my God. Well, I better finish up my workload for Townsend before I take off. You go ahead. - See ya later. (eerie music) (buzzing) - I thought Warren fixed that. (clattering) - Okay, let's review this one more time, for me because I'm slow. (coyotes howling) Warren is hypnotizing papercutters and slicing people by remote control and you're using the same technique to get laid. Am I close? - This is just too much, Brad. - Well, hey, I like science fiction as much as anybody, but how could reading an article do this to him? I don't even believe what I'm saying! - Listen, I just finished reading the manuscript last night and it's more than that. - Well, what do you know about it? - I just told you, I've read it and it works. Anyway, he went further than the manuscript. Chandra talks about the device... - Who? - The guy who wrote it, he died some kind of horrible death, no one knows for sure. His mother found him dead in his room, so the story goes. It drove her crazy. Anyway, she still lives there in that house. - She's still there? (whirring) (clattering) (eerie music) - That's weird. - I hid the final chapter from Warren. In it, Chandra talks about how the weak mind, the emotionally immature mind, can grow but in deviated ways. It kinda scared me. - Yeah, because it sounded just like Warren. - Wow, that was gnarly! Do you have any, like, jungle records? (coyotes howling) - So you think those papers could make Warren act bizarre? - It'll get even worse if he get ahold of that device, his mind just isn't... - Device, what device? - I just told you, the final chapter gets real incoherent. Some electrical conducer that I think could immensely magnify anything the paper showed how to do. If Warren ever gets ahold... - You've been reading it too, right? Well, it's affected you differently than Warren. Look, if anybody... - In the city good at digging up weird facts, it's me, you're right. We've gotta get to the bottom of this. - Hey, how'd you do that? - Kinda spooky, huh? (eerie music) - "Soon concentration becomes complete. "The final step is the one thing that can only be achieved "through molecularly aligning "with a negative electrical charge. "It has to be true!" (Warren gurgling) - [Brad] What am I gonna do? - You can't do anything, jerk! (whirring) (knocking) - Yes? - Uh, may I speak with Mrs. Chandra, please? - Mrs. Chandra? No, I'm sorry, no one's visited Mrs. Chandra in years, she doesn't take visitors. - I just wanted to ask her a few questions. I was a very close friend of her son's. - Oh my. Mrs. Chandra. Mrs. Chandra, you have a visitor. (ticking) - Mrs. Chandra? My name is Larry Bickett. - You can't over-water these plants! I've been telling the maid that now for weeks! Now look at these! Aren't they lovely? Yes, you can take them. Here, look at them closely. - They're beautiful. - What do you know? - Oh, not much, I just wanted to ask... - What do you know about beauty? The ignorant fool, you can't over-water these so she leaves them dry! - I, uh... - They beg for nourishment and they curl up oh so slowly. Can't she see they're dying? They're, they're so helpless, they could be so beautiful! They don't understand these things. - I just wanted to ask you a few questions about... - I'll ask the questions! Don't you talk about him, don't you ever! - Please, Mrs. Chandra, those research papers... - Give me this! (shattering) - Mrs. Chandra, are you all right? - You get out of here! It's all your fault, it's all you fault! - This happens all the time. - Please, Mrs. Chandra, a friend of mine's been reading... - He was a genius, they did not notice. And now who will pay for this? - I said my friend... - Ignorant fool! The papers can't cause this! This is wrong, horrible, look at this, can't you see? - Uh, but the papers... - He created beauty, the essence of our life force. - Then who created this? - The basement! (sobbing) My God! The basement! - It's in the basement. (static) (knocking) - Warren, I've been doing a lot of thinking. We need to talk. Warren, I'm talking to you, what are you doing? - Of course, my dear, sit down! - I don't quite know how to say this. (Sandy screaming) (growling) - Sandy, don't go! (dramatic music) (knocking) (Sandy screaming) (creaking) (Sandy screaming) (growling) (roaring) (Sandy screaming) (roaring) (Sandy panting) (Warren panting) (tense music) (energetic music) (tense music) (whirring) (phone ringing) - Sandy Crawford. - [Brad] Sandy, this is Brad, how're you doing? - Oh Brad, I'm so glad you called. - [Brad] Is Larry in? - No, he hasn't come in today. - [Brad] Well, listen, I've got some good news for you, guess. Come on, guess! - I don't know, what? - [Brad] Well, I think I got some of this figured out. Are you okay? - I'm sorry, I'm so tired and I have a splitting headache, I hardly slept at all last night. - [Brad] I'm sorry to hear that. Well, have Larry call me. - Yes. - [Brad] Have him call me, okay? - Yes, I will. - I'll explain everything tonight. So let's meet, you, Larry, and me. Right, at six. Now have him call me as soon as he gets in. No, no, I think we can straighten the whole thing out. - Really? I hope so. Oh, Brad? You've been really helpful. I'll see you later. Bye. I need some more aspirin. (people chattering and whispering) (eerie music) (Warren panting) (tense music) (Warren sniffling) (squishing and gurgling) (Warren screaming) (Warren panting) - Warren? Is that you? (tense music) Warren, where are you? Why are you whispering? - Sandy? God, I'm sorry, didn't mean to scare ya. What're you looking at down there? (Warren panting) - It's probably just Warren. Look, I think he needs some help down there. - Yeah, he seems to have a lot on his mind these days. Oh, listen, that reminds me, before I go, you know that friend of his, oh, what's his name? Oh, you know, he works in your department too, you know, the goofy one? - Bickett. - Yeah, Bickett, well, he's not so goofy anymore, not according to Miss Tori Parker, she seems to find him very interesting. Honestly, I don't know what... (clattering) You better go help him out down there. (tense music) - Warren, where are you? - Sandy. - I've got no time for games, Warren! (thudding) (eerie music) Oh my God, what is that? (thudding) (clicking) What's goin' on here? - (snapping) Damn, must've left 'em on Sandy's desk. - Who's there? - That's funny, it's not usually locked. Oh, there they are. (Warren panting) - Warren? Wherever you are, I've gotta get going. (tense music) Warren? (buzzing) (thudding) (suspenseful music) (tense music) - Finally! My God, I have wait for this moment (yelping). Don't, don't! (Sandy whimpering) Can't you see? - No! - You can't escape! Listen! Can't you see? You're perfect and I must have you. Now. Now! (Sandy screaming) It, it's trying to leave me! It's trying to leave my body! No! (dramatic music) (Sandy screaming) No! Don't go! Don't move! I must have you! I love you! - No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! (Sandy screaming) - [Operator] This is 9-1-1 emergency line, can you hold please? - No! (Sandy crying) (tense music) (squishing) (static) (knocking) - It's open. - It's me. - Hi, go on, sit down. (eerie music) Everything okay? - Everything is fine. - Good, good. Warren's not here. - I know. - Right. Now Bickett's working on it, I think we've got the whole thing figured out. You sure you're okay? - Oh my gosh, this is it! This is what he wrote about! (Larry howling) Excuse me, sometimes I get a little excited, I... - Mrs. Chandra gave me very specific instructions only to allow you in here for just a few minutes. - Excuse me, was that the phone? (phone ringing) - I will be right back. (tense music) (whirring) - So if we can find him, I'm sure we can... (Sandy gagging) Are you all right? Here, let me take your coat. - No! I'm cold. I just need some water. - Okay. (eerie music) This is weird, something's wrong with her. What can I do about this? - Brad? Brad, this whole thing has me just terrified. Please come sit by me. - [Brad] I'll be there in a minute, I'm just gonna try and get Larry over here. (phone ringing) (Larry howling) - [Answering Machine] Hello, this is Lone Wolf Bickett. I'm probably at Swingles doing my thing. Call me there, they all know me by name, or leave a message at the beep. - Oh Brad, oh Brad hold on, I'll be right there! Oh. (clicking) - The phone just went dead. - Brad! Come here, hurry! (dramatic music) (loud rock music) (TV chattering) (TV and radio chattering) - Well, that makes no sense whatsoever. If the line were down, the switchboard operator would cut in. (TV and radio chattering) No, actually, the PBX rerouting computer would cut in. (TV and radio chattering) Oh shit! (TV and radio chattering) - Sandy? Sandy? (dramatic music) - Don't come any closer, Brad. - Sandy, what is wrong? - God help me! - Tell me what's wrong! - Warren! Warren hates you! Don't you see what's happening? Can your pitiful brain comprehend this? (laughing) Just be yourself, Brad! - Sandy... (zapping) - Haven't you figured out who's in charge here? It's too late, Brad! (thudding) You thought you could get her, didn't you? Mr. Playboy gets all the girls! Well, I have her now! (thudding) I hate you! I've always hated you! And now I will destroy you! (laughing) - What do you want from me? - [Sandy] Times up, Brad! (zapping) - Hey, Brad, I got it! - Get out of here, Bickett! - I got it! - Come here, Larry! - Oh shit! Excuse me, um... (thumping) - You've brought just what I needed, Larry. What are you doing, Brad? Please don't hurt me. I love you. - No! - Come on now, Brad. (yelping) (squishing) (dramatic music) (shrieking) - Warren, no! Don't come any closer! (shrieking) Look what you've become! Is there's anything left of you in there, Warren, or has your inadequacies... (shrieking) You never would've hurt somebody! You lived in fear of your mind! (shrieking) (zapping) (shrieking) (beeping) (shrieking) - I can control it, I have restraint, I am in control... (shrieking) (booming) (shrieking) (zapping) (booming) (Sandy crying) (somber music) - I don't know what's happening!
