This ﬁlm is loosely based on the book by Andre Bamberski which testifies to his battle for truth Yes? Open up! Move back, sir. Police. Stand there. Hello, Mr Bamberski? Yes. You admit getting a call from Boris Milevski? Commissioner, look what I found. - Is this yours? - Yes. - How much? - 20,000 euros. Is it illegal? Mr Bamberski, it is 7 AM. You are under arrest. Why? I can answer you. You know why. Put your coat on, sir. You are now under arrest. You can contact a relative, ask to see doctor, or a lawyer, choose to answer, or remain silent. I am charging you with kidnapping, assault and battery and conspiring with criminals. I am placing you under court supervision and in detention. Taking the law into your own hands, is a crime. I never intended to take the law into my own hands only to make up for the cowardice of French justice. KALINKA Morocco, 1974 Aziz... We can't certify this, it's out by 6,853 Dirhams. It can go in profit and loss. Not knowing its origin? For a balance of 20 million, I thought... I pay you to count, not to think. So look again, see you tomorrow. Hello, pet. Enjoy the show? - Happy? - You missed it. Yes, I had a lot of work. See you later, pet. Sweetheart! You liked the show? Yeah. Look what I won in the lucky clip. So pretty! Sorry, snowed under. Was it good? Wonderful! But don't worry, it's all in here. Dr Krombach, Lena's clad. She's in the same class as Kalinka. Right, I hear they're good friends. Yes, real pals. Lena just raves about Kalinka. Dieter's invited the kids over on Wednesday. Weren't they invited last week? Say yes, Daddy. If it's not a bother... Not at all. It's a lot easier for me to mind all four. In that case, I give in. Thank you. - Thanks, Daddy. - Sure. Kali! They're cute, eh? They get on so well. Yes, they almost never argue. By the way... did you listen to my record? Sorry, I'll drop it back later. No, that's not what I meant. I was just wondering if you liked it. A lot. I thought it was wonderful! Really? Yes. Well, if you liked it you must listen to Lohengrin, also by Furtwangler. His version is unrivalled. I'm sure you'll love it. Thank you, I'll return the other later. No worries. You can hold on to both. Because I'll be away for the next two weeks we're going skiing in Bou Iblane. Really? When do you leave? On Saturday. Listen, I don't want to impose, but... my kids love skiing, we go often. So, if you want that we meet at the resort let my phone ring once. I'll understand. Okay? - So, I ask the first question? - Yes. Is it a farm animal? No. Does it have feathers, hairs or scales? Feathers and hairs. Feathers and hairs! - It can't be. - Doesn't exist. Watch out! Are you okay? Kalinka! Pierre! - Are you alright, pet? - Yes. Kalinka, my darling, speak to me... She's bleeding. Move aside. Speak to Daddy. Answer me! What happened? I swerved to avoid that car... Kalinka, can you hear me? I know a hospital nearby. Don't look, pet. Easy does it... Yes? Come in. Good morning. How is she? A lot better. She slept really well. Good morning, miss. - Which hand? Left or right? - Left. - Here. - Thank you. It'll give you energy and it's full of iron. But don't scoff the lot! I saw the doctor. Everything is fine. You can leave tomorrow. Thank you for all you've done. It's nothing. The least I can do. There you go. Thank you. See you soon. I can't... Mr Bamberski... Frisk him and put him in a cell. Place your personal effects in this box. Watch, belt... Turn... In you go. Kiddies! Daddy's home! Daddy! Hi, sweethearts. You ate all your meatballs! I got an A+ in recitation. Well done, darling! Know where Mom is? At the tennis club, a cocktail party... Right, I forgot. Fatna, you didn't see an orange folder? I've mislaid it. No, sorry sir. I'll go look. Eat every bit, I'll be right back. How long's it been going on? A few weeks. Since the accident. I tried to resist, I swear. But he kept hovering and you're never around. Do you love him? If you're not happy with me, we should separate. No... My place is here with you and the children. We change nothing. I'll just stop seeing him. We can't stay here, near him. After this, it's just not possible. No... I'll go see about the freight. Come on, kiddies... Get out and stretch your legs. Good day, gentlemen... What are you doing here? Go, he might see you! I don't want you to leave. Go, I beg you! Okay, kids. Say goodbye to Morocco. Goodbye, Morocco! Goodbye, Morocco! André said you're looking for a job? Even better, I found one. Really? Doing what? Saleswoman in an estate agent's. Wonderful! Where? In Nice. Nice? But why so far? Because the main agency is there. For now, I'm on trial and if all goes well they'll let me manage a new agency here. That's why they liked my profile. Wow, pretty good for a first job. Well done! How will you manage with the kids? I'm here, we have a great nanny and anyway, it's only for a while. Come on, we'll be late! We're off, drive safely. Don't worry, I'll call you tonight. Okay- Bye, Mommy. My darlings! I love you to bits! Hurry, you'll be late for school. Bye. Hello, are you Mr Krombach? Yes. Mr Finkel, court bailiff, mandated by Mr Bamberski to establish an act of adultery. - I'd ask you to let me enter. - No. I am applying a court order, sir. Don't have me call the police. If I may... Good day, are you Mrs Bamberski? Yes. Excuse me, but I'll now proceed to establish adultery. It's very simple. Do you admit spending the night with Mr Krombach? Yes. Very good, may I see your ID please? Yours too, sir. Thank you. Please, have a seat. Here is the court order, for your perusal. 8 years later, 1982 Isn't it a bit small for an archive? Not at all, once shelved, it'll be fine. And best get started on the decor. Mr Bamberski will be moving office end of August. No problem, we'll be ready. As long as we order the paints. I'm still not sure, I need your advice. Thank you gents, see you next week. Call you when Mr Bamberski decides. Right, so. Goodbye. So, Mr Bamberski, your colours... I'm still hesitating between this pale beige and this more golden-hued one which reminds me of the beaches of Assila. The kids are off to their Mom's in Germany so I thought we deserved a little break. Yes. Don't laze in the sun, play sport. And try to revise every day. I don't think your brains get much exercise there. But it is the holidays, so have fun. Goodbye, son. Bye, Dad. - Happy holidays. - You too. Hi, I'll be accompanying you... I'll get it. Yes? Yes, hold on. It's Dany. Yes? What? What happened? What's wrong, André? What is it? She asked me to wake her early. But when I entered the room she didn't react. I saw she was unconscious. I tried everything to resuscitate her. First, a cardiac massage. Then, injections to stimulate her heart. But it was too late. Honestly, I tried everything. But what did she die of? I don't know. Maybe sunstroke. It was very hot that day. And Kalinka spent all day at the pool. Yes, that's right. She felt unwell after the pool. She woke up during the night. She told me she had a headache and asked me for a sleeping pill. Sol gave her one. You also mentioned the car accident. Yes, it's possible. Even years later, the repercussions can be fatal. But the autopsy will tell. AutopSY? It's standard procedure for repatriating a body. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit... Amen. Think she was taking drugs? Kalinka? I don't know... No, I don't think so, why? Maybe she overdosed. I still haven't received the autopsy. You should have. When did you send it? I can't recall. When you asked me. You sent it here, or to the office? I told you, I can't recall. Well, do this. Mail me a registered copy today to the house. - There you go. - Thanks. Goodbye, Georges. Hello, Mr Bamberski. Thanks for your help, you could've posted it. No, I wanted to speak to you in person. Is there a problem? I'm not a doctor, I just translated it... Come, let me explain. "Supine, on the table, the body of Kalinka Bamberski is clad in a night dress. The clothing is cut and removed. On the right forearm is a blood clot, beneath the mark of an injection. According to her step-father's declaration he injected her with Kobalt-Ferrlecit the previous evening as she complained she wasn't tanning. Yet the administration of ferruginous substances to enhance sun tanning is a method that cannot satisfy the required goals. Furthermore, Dr Krombach also said that the next morning he injected Cora min, Novodigal and Isoptin in an attempt to resuscitate her. The use of such drugs seems both odd and grotesque given that death occurred between 3 and 4 AM. We remove the panties. Spreading the legs we observe a one-centimetre tear on the right labia which is slightly bloody. Opening the vagina we observe a greasy, fetid smelling substance of a whitish, or grey-green colour. In light of this autopsy we cannot give a clear cause of death..." What is commonly called the Virchow Technique it is in fact the Gohn technique, remarkably described by Louis Orsay. This is a stage by stage evisceration technique... It's incredible! - What? - This autopsy. In girls of that age the first thing to check for is sexual activity. They didn't do it. - Why not? - I don't know. Without further analysis of the German samples we can't say for sure. Just give me your honest opinion. As you insist, I will. For me, there was a sexual act which may be linked to your daughter's death. So, what do you suggest] do? Want my advice, Mr Bamberski? You want to know the truth, but it's unbearable. I say, bum this document and forget it. It'll only cause you pain. Lindau, Germany - What are you doing here? - We need to talk. Come. Did you know the autopsy was part of a police inquiry? No. Did you read it? I can't, André. I had it translated... It's damning! - What is? - The sheer negligence. What was that iron injection Krombach gave her the night she died? Nothing, it was to give her a nice tan. You came to tell me that? No, they found... a whitish substance in her vagina. Kalinka was probably raped. What? By who? She was home all evening. André... What brings you here? Why were you at the autopsy? Sorry? The report states you were present at the autopsy. I'm a doctor, I wanted to make sure... And your farcical attempt to resuscitate her that morning? I told you, I tried everything... Everything you did was absurd it's written in the report! Yes, it's true, you're right I panicked. Liar, what did you do to her? He did nothing! Kalinka was a daughter to me never would I have hurt her. I don't believe you. One day I'll know what you did to my daughter. I've hired a lawyer here in Germany to re-open the inquiry. And you, be warned: Pierre will never set foot here again, never! One year Ia ter... Munich Central Court, 1983 Mr Bamberski requests more in-depth analysis of the genital organs to establish if there was rape or not. If the coroner didn't do so it means nothing supported that thesis. It's simply incredible that in a case of unexplained death an inquiry worthy of the name wasn't launched. We ask you to immediately overturn the decision of the Kempten court to close the case and to launch an investigation that follows up every lead including possible rape or murder, which were never seriously considered. |..\ \ \ .\.\. \ your case lacks substance. It is you who lack substance by protecting a murderer! It's shameful! So what will you do now? The prosecutor was very clear. This case is definitively closed, without appeal. There's nothing more I can do. My sincerest apologies. I remain at your disposal, call me if need be. Goodbye. "Ladies and Gents, a criminal lives right here in Lindau, "Dr Dieter Kromba ch. "On Friday 9 July 1982, at his home, he killed "my wonderful daughter Kalinka. "Despite the disturbing evidence "a sexual act was never even mentioned. "Why have the German courts twice closed this case? "Who is pulling strings for good Dr Krombach? "I demand publicly that justice be done "and the exact cause of my daughter's death revealed. ”Ka fin ka's murderer must be pun fished. ” Okay, I secured your release. But you are charged with public disorder, insults, contempt of court and slandering Krombach. Perfect, we can now reopen the case. And you risk a prison sentence and a heavy fine. I advise you to leave Germany and never set foot here again. Seriously. Hello, Mr Bamberski. Hi, Violaine, how are you? If you have time, I have a job for you. Mail these pamphlets to all inhabitants of this zone. The addresses are in the directory. To everyone? Yes, everyone. I consulted the Criminal Procedure Code and saw that one could apply to the High Court for crimes against French people abroad. I wish to sue Krombach for rape and wilful murder and to entrust the case to you. Why me? Because I know international cases don't faze you. Mr Bamberski, as I explained to you on the phone I'm an odd kind of lawyer. I work alone, no associates, not even an assistant. I'll assist you, I just need advice. I even drafted a complaint. - Mr Bamberski... - Please... help me, so my daughter's murder is not forgotten. As you know, Mr Krombach refused to answer in France but did agree to questioning by a German judge. And? In the end, he refused to come forward pleading his right to silence. Great, a whole year of procedure for that! While Krombach's silence is understandable I can't see why Ka|inka's mom has also refused to testify. How do you explain her attitude, her silence about Krombach's shady side? Sadly, we never had any rational discussion on that. Your Honour, to get things moving, we feel that we must concretize the evidence. And to do so, one means at our disposal is to show that Kalinka was sexually abused. Exhumation of the body of Kalinka Bamberski: On the torso, is an incision, a mark of the previous autopsy. Examining the pelvic cavity and perineum we note that the external genital organs have been removed: the pelvic cavity is empty, with no residue. All external and internal genital organs are completely gone. The genital organs are missing. I'm sure it was Krombach. He was there at the autopsy. He managed to erase all traces of his rape! Hello... I'm replacing the previous judge who's on maternity leave. Good news. I finally got Kempten to agree to send us all the samples from the first autopsy. But when? I can't say. Soon, I hope. And when we get them I'll order new examinations. One year later, 1988 The new examinations ordered by my predecessor give us a clearer picture of what happened on the night of 10 July, 1982. Kalinka most likely died from Mende|son's syndrome. Meaning, the epiglottis, which blocks food from entering the airways, did not work and she choked on her own vomit. Which can only happen in a deep coma, or violent shock. This suggests that your daughter fell into a coma due to the injection. Only we can't know what that injection was. - Pierre, had a nice weekend? - Not bad. You see a lot of your mom. She comes from Germany each time? I dunno, she didn't say. They've separated? I've work to do, early start. I need to know, Pierre, it's important. She's back in France? Living at Gran's? I've no idea. Why don't you ask her yourself? Dish your own dirt, I'm sick of you two! Piss off! As all seems to point to the guilt of Mr Krombach... what's stopping you from bringing him to trial? You're sure KaIinka's mother is living at this address? Yes, I'm positive. Good day, sir. Please, be seated. As you know, Mr Bamberski is eager to clarify the circumstances of your daughter's death and we'd like to hear you answer his questions. Go ahead, Mr Bamberski. Yes, I'd like to know why, when Kalinka died, Krombach and you carefully avoided telling me about the iron injection he gave her? That's not true. When Andre came to see her body Dieter told him. No, he never mentioned it. I first learnt of it in the autopsy report. Why did you refuse, like Mr Krombach, to be questioned by the French authorities? Dieter told me his lawyer advised against it. It does seem odd when a mother hinders an inquiry into her daughter's death. I declined to answer as I could no longer bear the morbidity of my ex-husband with his vile accusations of rape and murder! Be honest. Did Krombach threaten you? I've never felt threatened by anyone but you. Then why did you split up? I left him for reasons independent of my daughter's death that concern only me. He has my complete trust. This whole affair is just your revenge on Dieter for stealing your wife. You're imagining things! No, I'm not imagining things. I'm sure! What brings you here? May I ask you to dinner, Miss? With pleasure. See you tomorrow. What a nice idea! It's not my birthday, so what's the occasion? - Here. - What is it? I don't believe it. "Referral to Criminal Court... "Dieter Krombach... "Charged with wilful murder" When is the trial? He'll try to buy time. He's already appealed, but he'll face trial. - And if he refuses? - Trial in absentia. If he's convicted, Germany must respect the international arrest warrant. Well done, it's amazing. I admire your determination, many would've given up. To us! All rise! The court is now in session, you may sit. The proceedings against Mr Krombach, Dieter born May 5, 1935 in Dresden... And why else, if not to mask the cause of death did Dr Krombach make a sham attempt at resuscitation? The Public Prosecutor asks the court to sentence Dieter Krombach for having wilfully murdered Kalinka Bamberski to 30 years' imprisonment. The Paris Criminal Court sentences Dieter Krombach to 15 years' imprisonment. How come they reduced his sentence by half? Yes, he should've got 30 years. But I think you underestimate the huge pressure from the Germans. During the verdict, I even feared he might be acquitted. In all sincerity, you ought to feel satisfied. Don't forget, it took 13 years of obstinacy to get this far. So today is a victory. Promise me you'll savour it. Here, give that to your granddad. And I'll take these... There you go, Mom. Darling... So what's the story with that bastard Krombach? My lawyer is seeking application of his conviction in Germany but it's hopeless. Sit there, dad. Thank you. Listen, André... don't take this badly... but don't you think it's time to stop? You did all that was humanly possible! And all for what? You had him convicted. He's living a normal life. I hear he even had a child with a young woman. It's time you thought of yourself and of... Cécile. You'll wake up one day and it'll be too late. Come and dance! Come on! See how time flies... And one thing I'm sure of is that Kalinka wouldn't begrudge you. - The Akchour waterfalls. - Looks pretty. We could go tomorrow? Sure. Andre', sorry to bother you, but I just heard the international warrant for Krombach is still on hold. What's holding it? High level politics. Germany is piling on the pressure and France wants to avoid a diplomatic incident. Then write to the Ministry! To get the run around again? No thanks. So what do we do? I have a little idea. But you need to return to Paris on the double. Crime without punishment Why is France protecting the murderer of a 14-year-old? A nice little move, well done! And I'm glad to say I just got authorization to pass on the warrant for Krombach to Interpol. But what difference will it make? You know very well the Germans will never extradite him. Excuse me. Yes? A call for you from Germany. Okay, I'll take it outside. Sorry, I'll be right back. Thank you. Mr Bamberski? Speaking. I'm a journalist with the Lindau daily. We met about 15 years ago, you came with pamphlets. Yes, I remember very well. Could I ask you a few questions? About what? I'm writing an article on Dr Krombach. You sure take your time! Sorry? You haven't heard? Heard what? Krombach was arrested. For raping one of his patients, a girl of 16. You shouldn't go there. What if they arrest you? You still have a conviction. No, that's old hat... I'll keep a low profile, I promise. Yeah, sure. So, here we go again? I can't not go. I know. Kempten, Germany, 1997 What's going on? A women's pressure group, they're outraged. Why? They claim they were also abused by Krombach but the court has refused their testimony. All rise. The court is now in session. What's that man doing here? He's dangerous. Please, arrest him! He's come to kill me. He's armed, he wants to kill me. He's crazy. He paid this girl to say I raped her. It's insane. Do something! Check if he is armed. I assure you, he's not armed. Please, follow me. Miss, could you tell us about your visit to Dr Krombach... on 11 February, 1997? It all began a few days before. I went to consult Dr Krombach for stomach aches. It wasn't serious, but] had to go back for an endoscopy. I was very scared beforehand. But Dr Krombach said: "Don't be afraid, I'll give you an injection." Which he did. What happened then is a blank. When I woke up, I was unable to move. Suddenly, Dr Krombach came into the room. He closed the door and approached me. He said something. Then he kissed me. He began to fondle my breasts. He raped me. It really hurt, but I couldn't defend myself. The accused, Dr Dieter Krombach, charged with the sexual abuse of a defenceless person, is sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment. But as the accused pleaded guilty and renounced the right to exercise his profession, his sentence is suspended. The hearing is adjourned. - What do you want? - To talk. About what? You know what happened in Germany? That Krombach raped a 16-year-old after an injection. Ring any bells? Dieter never needed to rape anyone. He's a skirt chaser. All those he desired, he had. Consenting and in love. Like Kalinka? Enough of that. Open your eyes! Always the same pattern, injections and rapes. He's a pervert. Why did he give iron injections only to girls? Why never to Pierre? Once he'd got you used to it, he could inject what he liked. There you go, raving again... Look what you've become, an old paranoiac. Kalinka died because her time had come. It's painful enough as it is, without your insane rant. I've had it with you. Now go. Just go. Fuck off! How can you live such a lie, Dany? See? Lindau is here. And this is Lake Constance, bordered by Switzerland, Austria and Germany. Krombach can no longer practice in Germany, so to find work he has to cross these borders. So? I'm going to visit all the border posts and ask if they got the international arrest warrant. All of them? All of them. There is an international warrant for his arrest... Keep an eye out. Hi, I'm home! Cécile? Austria, 1998 Mr Krombach? Yes. Could you come with us, please? What for? We'll explain. They arrested him! In Austria. I informed the Prosecutor, they'll extradite. They arrested him! That's great. See? Now it's all over. Won't you come back? You'll never let up. I will, I promise. I thought that... despite all, we'd have a child. I'm 40 now, I need to know. Can we, one day? You can't ask that of me. You know it's impossible. You can't ask that. The director is in a meeting, but I checked, the extradition order was sent to Austria. Listen, Madam... the sending of a fax is not enough. I need to meet the director to see how he intends to pursue this request. Ministry of Justice, Paris Good day, gentlemen. Mr Bamberski, Maitre Gibault... I assure you it was filed correctly. We're waiting to hear from the Austrians. Instead of waiting, I hope you'll lean on them as I'm sure the Germans are already doing so. Yes? Thank you. The Foreign Office. The Austrians acceded to the Germans. They freed Krombach. It's outrageous, you must act without delay! This is in flagrant violation of extradition rules! The Austrians must hand Krombach over. ”Madam Minister; I write anew "regarding the scandalous case of my daughter, Kalinka. "When I finally got Dr Krombach arrested in Austria..." ”Mr Prime Min Ester, "I wish to express my hostility to this liberation "whereby Austria has ﬂouted its engagements..." ”Mr President of France, "I ask you to order your ministers to demand the extradition "of Dr Kromba ch using coercive measures..." If that's how it is, let's start again! You want another? You've got it! "Dear Sir..." "It is clear, Mr Bamberski has flipped his lid..." Yes, he has! Mr Bamberski, no better man... That's it... I have them now. I requested the Krombach file from the European Court of Human Rights. I read it and it's most enlightening. For example: Krombach's lawyers admit having received assurances from the Public Prosecutor in Paris that the sentence would be waived. If that isn't collusion between France and Germany... And there are many more examples, not to mention e-mails between judges for whom I'm a mad, old paranoiac. For them, it is clear: "Mr Bamberski has flipped his lid..." "He sent us the Krombach file, it'd fill every cupboard "in the Chancellery!" - It's damning. - Sue them. - Who? - All of them. Those judges who from incompetency or cowardice have impeded the course of justice. Why not sue the Minister of Justice for failure of public service? You could get hefty compensation. To hell with money, I want accountability, to sue them for impeding justice and corruption. André, I've always sided with you... But no longer? I know them inside out. They'll never disavow one of their own. Even if you're basically right such a lawsuit will never succeed. Don't begrudge me, but I've no desire to take them on. I'm sorry. I didn't take proper care of Kalinka. I was naive and stupid. I should never have trusted in French justice. I should've gone to Austria, hired a la wyer and fought it there. I'm sorry. Don't worry... I spoke to Colbeau, he'll hire you on the same basis. But it'll never be the same. You've seen me, I can't focus on my work nor on the case, I'm failing both. Prescription is nearing I've no margin for error. But what will you live on? I'll take early retirement. I'll manage, don't worry. Bavaria, Germany, 2006 Kemp ten Prison, 2008 Dad... Good to see you. Are you okay? What do you want now? You're scared, eh? Let go of this hysteria... this madness. I'll never let go. Never! I rushed to the window, looked out into the street and I saw three men... Good evening, routine check. Border control. Yes, go ahead. Colour? Brand? Stop that car! Bamberski sent you? What'|| you do to me? Don't believe what he tells you. It's not true. He's lying. What're you doing? I'm innocent. Believe me. I beg you. Let me go. I beg you. Police. By the canal, you'll find a man wanted by the French authorities. His name is Dieter Krombach, he's German. He raped and killed a young girl 27 years ago. I repeat: Dieter Krombach. By the canal in Mulhouse. Hello? Boris speaking. It's done. Where are you? In Mulhouse. Okay, I'm on my way. Police! Hands up! Out of the car! Out! On the ground! Face down! Bamberski, let's go. - Where's he off to? - Hospital. Bring him before a judge! There's a warrant for him. For now, it's you who's seeing the judge. Thank you. Hello, André. Frangois, what are you doing here? When I heard the news, I took the first plane. You really are crazy. I spoke to the Public Prosecutor. Krombach was transferred to a hospital in Paris. He'll see the Custody Judge who'll decide whether to release or imprison him. He told you that? Exactly. Your phone? Sorry? Call the Prosecutor, he won't pick up for me. Prosecutor's office ? This is Frangois Gibault again for the Prosecutor. Hold on, please. Thank you, miss. Mr Prosecutor, this is André Bamberski. I'll be brief, so please listen. I don't have time... No, you will listen to me. The Criminal Procedure Code is crystal clear. You do not refer him to the Custody Judge, Krombach is under warrant for arrest. Your duty is to detain him until judged anew by a criminal court. If he is freed, I'll hold you responsible. - Is that clear? - Absolutely. Fine, goodbye, sir. I don't know why I'm here you no longer need me. Except... Remember our little news stunt? Go and speak to them. They love your story. Do you admit kidnapping Dr Krombach? Yes, I was behind his kidnapping. I take full responsibility for it and I thank the kidnappers for having done the job of the French legal system. Did you know that Dieter Krombach was indicted in Germany in 1997? Yes. Has that changed your view of KaIinka's death? No. He'd never have done that to Kalinka. I'd stake my life on it. This is the testimony of two sisters, minors, who met Mr Krombach after your separation. He took them to England. "When we got to the hotel "he told us we needed an iron injection. "After that, I passed out. "Strangely, so did my sister in the next room. "When I awoke, he was behind me, with no pants on. ''I don't know what he did to us while unconscious." The neighbour with whom he cheated on you also came forward. She said he dissolved tranquilizers in your drink to put you to sleep. And they had sex in the lounge while you slept upstairs. In the light of these testimonies could Mr Krombach have given Kalinka a sleeping pill the night she died? And also to you? Hello? Frangois Gibault here. So, any news? Yes, excellent news. Krombach has been placed in detention. He'll at last be sent for trial at the Criminal Coun‘. Can you believe it, Andre? It's taken almost 30 years. Thank you, Frangois. There... I kept my promise never to give up. This battle, I fought it for you. And despite the difficulties, the years of sacriﬁce, I have no regrets. Today, you'd be forty-four. I miss you. In 2012, Dieter Krombaoh was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment for involuntary manslaughter. The charge of rape was dismissed. As his appeal was rejected by the Court of Cassation he lodged an appeal against France before the European Coun‘ of Human Rights. Andre' Bamberski got a one-year suspended sentence for kidnapping.
