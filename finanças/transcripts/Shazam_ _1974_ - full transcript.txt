Chosen from among all others by the Immortal Elders Solomon, Hercules, Atlas Zeus, Achilles, Mercury Billy Batson and his Mentor travel the highways and byways of the land on a never-ending mission to right wrongs, to develop understanding and to seek justice for all. In time of dire need, young Billy has been granted the power by the Immortals to summon awesome forces at the utterance of a single word. Shazam! [thunderclap] [instrumental music] A word which transforms him in a flash into the mightiest of mortal beings Captain Marvel! [music continues] - Nervous, Susie? - Nervous? What's to be nervous? With an experienced pilot like you. Well, your license is almost 24 hours old. I like the way you think. Let's go. Get your seat belt. Don't you ever go any place without that tape recorder? No, never. It's my security blanket. Clear! [engine cranking] Well, you might turn it off for a second so I can call the tower and get permission to taxi. Oh! Aye-aye, sir. 'Roger and all that kind of stuff.' Lincoln tower, this is 3-6-2-8 Victor at the north end taxi for take-off. Over. (man on radio) '28 Victor, taxi for take-off.' I'm impressed. Wait till you see how impressed my brother is when he finds out we flew into his wedding. [laughing] That my boy is the way the game of checkers is supposed to be played. 'You owe me seven million dollars.' Six million. I'll play you the limerick game. Double or nothing. Alright, you're on. Five second limit. Right. Whoever fails to come up with a line in five seconds, loses. Okay. - Who starts? - Well.. Since I'm about to become a multi-millionaire you may begin. Uh.. There-there once was a man from Detroit.. Detroit? Detroit? Um.. Who at point was extremely adroit. Ah.. So one day he tore.. Tore? Tore? Um.. The pants that he wore. Just in time. So instead he played in a skirt. Skirt? That's S-K-I-R-T, it's pronounced skirt. Not if you're from Brooklyn. Well, you don't come from Brooklyn! Well, if I did come from Brooklyn that's how you pronounce it. - So we're even. - Oh, no, no. I'm leaving this to Solomon to judge. [indistinct beeping] The Elders.. You think they heard you? [beeping] Oh, Elders, fleet and strong and wise appear before my seeking eyes. - Greetings, Billy. - Greetings, Elders. We would speak to you of pride, Billy. A two-edged sword. One edge is clean and bright. Pride in others and in self when justified. But the other edge is dull and tarnished. Pride that blinds a man to common sense that prevents a man from asking for help when he need it. And there are times when every man needs help. - Even Captain Marvel. - Captain Marvel? - Even he. - I don't understand. You will, Billy, when the time is right. And before we go tell Mentor I declare the limerick game a draw. (Solomon) 'Farewell, Billy.' [plane droning] That sure is a lot of water down there. That's why they call it an ocean. If it was just a little water, they'd call it the Pacific Lake. Funny. Listen, do you really know where you're going? I mean, I'm not the world's greatest swimmer, you know. Susie, this compass is headed straight for Santa Barbara airport. You just sit back and relax. Leave the flying to us. [chuckles] You haven't said a word in the past two hours, Billy. What's bothering you? What the Elders said about Captain Marvel needing help. Did they mean he was going to or was it a figure of speech, or what? Billy, you know by now the Elders don't talk to us to make conversation. And your worrying about it isn't going to help. I'm sure you'll find out what they meant when the time comes. Yeah. I suppose you're right. [plane droning] Shouldn't we be seeing Santa Barbara by now? Don't be such a worrywart. Probably just a little head-weight holding us back. We'll make it. Why don't you play something on your security blanket? Okay. [instrumental music] - Holy smoke! - What's the matter? Give me that thing. Don, will you please tell me what's going on? We've been on ten degrees this whole time. Does that mean you don't know where we are? Well, not exactly. Well, isn't there anybody you can ask? Susie, I can take care of myself. I'm not gonna put out a "Mayday" and make everyone think I'm lost. Well, aren't you? Well, not enough to need any help. Hey, Billy! Billy, I got a big one! Hang on! Yeah, must weigh a ton. You need any help? No, no, no, no. It's alright. Feels like a whale. Well, it's either a whale or you'll pull out the plug and we'll lose the whole ocean. [grunts] Here it comes. Yeah, I hear they're delicious when they're fresh. The only problem is you gotta cook 'em a long time till they are tender. [plane droning] There's the sun right? So we'll just turn right. And then we'll follow it all the way to the beach. And then we'll follow the coast. What's that? [engine sputtering] (Don) 'We're out of gas.' [dramatic music] Hey, the plane's in trouble. It's never gonna make it to the beach. - They're gonna crash. - Maybe not. Shazam! [thunderclap] [instrumental music] - Anything we can do? - Susie, I'm doing it. Well, what about that other thing that, "Mayday?" No, no, I'm not gonna look like a fool. I can take care of this thing myself. Hurry, Marvel. Hurry! [instrumental music] Look there! Its Captain Marvel. He's gonna help us. [instrumental music] Oh! He's got us. We're safe. [music continues] [music continues] Oh, thank you so much, Captain Marvel. I really thought we had it. Well, that was a bad place to have your engine quit. Oh, it didn't quit. We ran out of gas. What were you doing that far from land when you were low in gas? Well, the compass went coo-coo because of my tape recorder but, Don, he didn't even know until it was too late. - Everybody alright? - Yes, sir. Everything's fine. You didn't need to bother Captain Marvel. I probably could've landed the bird myself. But thanks anyway. Well, we better get going to Santa Barbara if we're gonna make it for that wedding' Well, maybe we can give you a lift, huh? Oh, no, thank you. I can take care of it from here. Shouldn't you cancel a "Mayday" before you leave? - Oh, I didn't send a "Mayday." - You didn't? (Don) 'Oh, no way, I figured if you can't' do it yourself, don't do it. I mean, I don't ask for help from nobody. Oh, everybody needs help at times. No, sir, not me. I stand on my own two feet. I don't owe anybody anything. - Let's keep going. - Well, goodbye. 'Thanks again, Captain Marvel.' I'm afraid that young man is headed for serious trouble eventually. [instrumental music] You know, I like being down here better than flying. So much nicer to be able to smell things and touch them. It's a lot better being out here than cooped up in a hot city. Uh-huh. Except for people who do that. (Don) 'Wouldn't you think that people that came out here' would know better? Come on, let's give it a clean up job, okay? [instrumental music] Hey, Mentor, pull over now, will ya? [music continues] - What is it, Billy? - Do you smell something? [sniffing] - Smoke. - Yeah, I think so. - Hey, look. - 'Smoke.' If there's a forest fire this time of the year it could go like lightning. You call the fire department. I'll take a look. Shazam! [thunderclap] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] - Is it as bad as it looks? - Worse. It's completely out of control. 'I'm gonna need some help on this one.' (Mentor) Are those kids in there? I'm afraid they are. We got a lot of animals in there too. Is there anything I can do to help? Call the Elders. I'm going back to see if there's anyway to locate those kids. Fine. [dramatic music] I smell smoke. Don. Wow. Come on. Let's go. [dramatic music] (Susie) 'It's all around us.' Maybe not. Let's try this way. Move it. [groaning] Don, are you alright? It's my ankle. I think I broke it. Oh, Don, what are we gonna do? Listen, you gotta get out of here while you can. - 'Just go. Go ahead.' - No. (Don) 'Susie, there's nothing you can do to help me.' - 'Just go.' - 'No, I'm not going.' Oh, Elders fleet and strong and wise appear before my seeking eye. We hear you, Mentor. And we know your problem. There is only one person in the world 'who can aid Captain Marvel in his present situation.' Her identity is as secret as his. But in this case we will reveal it to you. You must go to her, Mentor. 'Immediately, time's short.' [knocking on door] Come in. - Ms. Andrea Thomas? - Yes. Oh, what can I do for you, Mr.. Mentor. A friend of mine has a very grave problem. I've been told that you're the only person who can help solve it. You've been told? By whom? - The Elders. - The Elders sent you to see me? They told me who you really are. Isis. Your friend, who is he? Captain Marvel. Captain Marvel? I think you should tell me the whole story, Mr. Mentor. Yes. [instrumental music] Oh, Mighty Isis.. [instrumental music] Sister Goddess Rohalind let me ride thy mighty wind. [instrumental music] [coughing] It's no use, Susie. I can't make it any further. Don, we've gotta try. Well, maybe if we lie in the river and wait for the fire to pass over us. No, there's not enough water there to save us from the heat. Susie, you can make it alone. Please go. No, not without you. [dramatic music] Sorry I got you into this, Susie. [music continues] Holy moly. Don! 'Captain Marvel.' Hang on, kids. Reinforcements are on the way. [dramatic music] Spirits of the water hear me. Help me fight thy enemy fire. Lay right there, Susie, I'll cover you both. [thunderclap] Take it easy, kids. Here comes the cavalry. - Welcome, Isis. - Yes, welcome, Isis. Captain Marvel, I'm very glad to meet you at last. You have no idea how glad we are. Yes, thank you, Isis. Thank you very much. That goes double for me. I think I learned something very important. If a man like Captain Marvel can accept help, I sure can. You're right, Don. That's a very important lesson. I'd like to add my thanks to theirs. No need. It was truly my pleasure. May I ask one more favor? Of course, anything. Promise me that if you ever need me anytime, anyplace, you'll call me? I promise. And now I must go. - Farewell, all. - Bye. - Goodbye, Isis. - Bye. A little soap and water and you'll be new people. I don't know if I wanna have things go that far. I kind of like the old Susie. Well, I think I'm gonna like the new Don better. Don's figured out that a man that's too stiff to bend is liable to break when the pressure's on. From now on he's gonna ask for help when he needs it. - Is that right, Don? - You bet. Starting now. I don't know how far can I hike with this old gimpy leg. - How about a lift? - Oh, sure. Sure. Let's get him inside. A poet name John Donne said, "No man is an island." What he meant was that we all need each other. There are a lot of things we can do by ourselves and it's a good feeling when we can. But it's kind of foolish and maybe even dangerous trying to do something by ourselves when we don't know how. Asking for help or advice when we need it isn't a sign of weakness. It shows your smart. See you next week. [theme music] [music continues]
