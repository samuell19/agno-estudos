[MUFFLED YELLING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] There's some stolen Russian subs, military US subs. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [INAUDIBLE] Now [INAUDIBLE] you know, I'm working with-- against the cartel. And you know how it is, right? I have a price tag on my head. Too much shit in here-- intel, knowledge. So I'm a walking death sentence. Cartel's motto is dead men don't talk. So you know, here I am talking on national television. And-- [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] I can only blab about so much, but I'm hoping that this interview will help flush out where this fucking sub might be, OK? Scene four, three-- Good evening, I'm Mark Harris. And tonight we have with us none other than the head of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration Mr. Craig Ford. Tonight we're going to be talking about international drug smuggling and how it's a problem for the citizens of the United States, even before the drugs hit our shores. Tonight it's about organized crime and what we are doing to combat these evil cartels. Mr. Ford, it's so great to have you with us. Um, just-- just Ford. Ford. Ford. No mister, just Ford. Ford, if you could, please paint a picture for us, this personification of evil that is the international drug cartel. Well, that's just it, Mark. The cartel employs what I'm calling now an active evil, which are the worst kind of scumbags, worst kind of people, sexual slavery, torture, rape, forced prostitution, forced castration. You get the picture, right? Now the cartel heads, they know what's going on. But they turn their backs and they behave as if it's business as usual. Now, seeing as I know as much as they know, if I weren't doing everything, I mean, everything in my power to stop it-- I mean, you get the picture, right? I mean, what difference am I from these motherfuckers? Ford, it's going to be much better for our television audience if you don't use words like "motherfucker" when I'm asking the questions. I'm sorry. OK. Being as close as you are to the cartel in this demanding and dangerous job, does it make you fear for your life? I'm sorry, are you asking me if I'm afraid of dying? Well, yes, if that's the way you want to put it. I welcome death. You understand? I welcome it. There's only one thing, I mean one thing that I'm afraid of, you understand? I'm afraid of living, man. And that makes me the perfect man for the job. [SHUTTER CLICKING] [OMINOUS MUSIC] [UPBEAT MUSIC] Come on, Courtney, just-- one more drink and then and then we'll go back to the room, I promise. One more Stoli. You know that your daddy would not approve of this. Cheers to senator Jack Stanfield. Decent Senator but the best-- Fucking dad ever. You see that guy over there that keeps looking at us? Yeah. But there's no way I'm letting either of us out of each other's sight. So you might as well just drop it. Yeah, I know but there's no harm in a little flirting. Hey, keep to yourself. Save it for the boys back home. OK, OK. So your dad's a big US Senator, huh? Senator? That's crazy. We know nothing of such senators. No, our families are poor potato farmers from Idaho. Tell you what, last drink's on me. To the poor American potato farmers. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Do you know who the fuck I work for? [SPEAKING SPANISH] Now do as you're told. Take that bitch to the beach and put a fucking bullet in her fucking head. You girls are in trouble. In trouble from who? Me. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Mr. Stryker, how are you doing today? I'm doing very well. Thank you, Ms. Tan. And you're finding everything OK in the office? I am, yes. Everyone is super friendly, showing me around. And what better place than Medellin, right? It's a gorgeous city, just like our office. That it is. Yeah. Yeah, we're super excited to have you here. I'm excited to be here. Thanks for the opportunity. The family settling in OK? Yeah, you know, it started out a bit hectic, but I think they're doing all right. Alison made some friends. Wonderful. She's got a sleep over tonight. Good to hear. Yeah, it'll provide a lot of much needed alone time with me and the missus. Oh, alone time with the missus. [EXHALES] Well, I'll let you get along with the rest of your day, OK? You have a good weekend. Thank you, you too. Thanks. [MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCKING] Hey, mom, have you seen my hairbrush? No, sweetie, I haven't. Hey, mom, have you seen my cellphone charger? No, honey, I haven't. Ew, dad. That's just gross. Sorry, sweet pea. Sorry, baby. Well, I'm going over to Janie's. Call me when you get there. Have fun, sweet pea. Love you. Love you. I didn't know. I didn't know. (SINGING) Hey. [VOCALIZING] What's going on? You know damn well, Bruce. She's fine. It's OK. It takes Allison one minute to get to Janie's, unless it's raining. And it's been 90 seconds. How about you just give her a call? Just give her a call. She probably just forgot. Yeah, maybe. [PHONE RINGING] She left her phone. Sweet pea? Allison? [PHONE RINGING] Stay right here. Dad's not going back to work, is he? I'm not sure. What happened? What is it? We just got Intel that two girls were taken while on spring break at a bar, Senator Jack Stanfield's daughter and her friend. They believe it was tied to the drug cartel for some kind of ransom money or worse. You'll always be safe with me, OK? You wanna come help daddy pack? Yeah. [? Had ?] to help. Come on. Let's go. How excited are you to see Uncle Ford? Really excited. He did great on that television show. He did, didn't he? What the heck was that? I think it was a great white shark. And that's supposed to scare me? Of course. It doesn't? Dad, there are no sharks out here. I mean, we're 38,000 feet up in the air. This is no ordinary shark. What do you mean? This is a flying shark. Blah, blah, blah. Can't get anything by you. You want to hear a real shark story? All right. When daddy was young, he was navigating in a small little submarine, routine. But we used to hear thumps like that all the time. And this one time, daddy's friend Captain Ken Kennedy and I decided to go up top to check it out. Guess what we saw when we got up there? What did you see? We saw the biggest fin. It was huge. It was like-- it was like a scene from Jaws. It was cool until we realized that thing was headed right for us. And it was coming fast. It hit the sub with so much force that it knocked Captain into the waters. Before you know it, the shark was on him. And it was shaking him around like a dog with a bone, you know? [YELLS] OK, you got me, dad. I admit it. I did. Thanks for bringing us to Washington with you while you train. Well, I'm going to be helping others train for their mission, you know? It's good to have you and mom with me before I leave. Love you, sweet pea. Love you too. [HONKING] [THUD] [THUD] [MUFFLED SPEECH] Speak up. I can't hear you. [MUFFLED SPEECH] Oh. [GROANS] Ah! I said are you the faggot that's going fix the leak. You're the plumber, right? You come here to fix the leak? Ow! Ow! That was unpleasant. You know, they call me the extractor. And I need some information, dog. And being that you're the head of the DEA with privileged information, you're going to tell me exactly what I need to know or you're gonna die a horrible fucking death, fat man, I promise. (HISPANIC ACCENT) Really sorry, man. You got the wrong guy, man. I am from [INAUDIBLE], Mexico. I'm a Mexican [? jumping ?] [? beans ?] of shit like you. Oh! [GAGS] Oh, shit. Motherfucker. Oh, wow, my memory just came back. Yeah I am the head of the DEA. That's me. Yeah, they call you the-- the Extractor, right AKA Spyder. How you know my name? I'm the head of the the DEA. I got privileged information like your dumb ass just said. What exactly do you know about me? You're the biggest dope dealer South of Panama. You work for Pelon. Others would say that it's the other way around. And your main client this last year was a cartel [? Mongrel ?] Dallas. But shipments have been prevented and delayed. Is it making that metal pipe you're holding all that much harder? That's just delightful, like for me, you know? [LAUGHS] Let's see if I can adjust your perception in terms of who I really am and help you see the real problem you face right now. Be right back. You promise? What are you gonna do? Oh, you brought your mother's underwear? I used to fuck her. Yeah, she wore bloomers. She had one of them Mexican asses that bounced off the curb, you know? Put your head back. Put your fucking head back. [INAUDIBLE] Oh, you know what? Maybe I wanna smell your mother's pussy again. Let me see. Oh, it's there. There she is. [GROANS] Wow. Oh, fuck. [VOCALIZES] Oh, I'm gonna kill you, you son of a bitch! You little pussy. You're such a little pussy pig. Put it back. Yeah, come on, ready? What's with the jokes? I wanna hear a joke. Tell me. What happened? You're not funny anymore. You're not funny now! What happened! You motherfucker, I'm gonna kill you, you son of a bitch! You intercepted my shit from Pelon. Big problem for me, which means big problem for you. Now listen, you can have the drugs. You have my personal fucking guarantee I will red carpet 'em. I don't give a fuck about the drugs. Where are the girls? That's our focus. You know what the real focus is? Stryker's plan. I want [INAUDIBLE]. I want to know where he lives. I want to know who his family is. You tell me where he is, OK? [GUNSHOT] [THUDDING] [GUNSHOTS] [THUD] [LAUGHS] Your wish is my command. I'm right here, my gun pointed at your head. Hey, Bruce, what took you so long? Took you long-- You see that, Spyder? When I say something's gonna jump, I deliver the product. Now slowly hand over the pipe. What are you waiting for? Shoot me. When you hesitate, your conviction is weak. There's no mercy in the world for weakness. Haven't you figured that out yet? Where are the girls? [INAUDIBLE] [THUD] [EXERTION SOUNDS] He's gone, huh? Yeah, he got away. You OK? Yeah. I knew that fucking TV spot was gonna give me my own personal Colombian bath, and look happened. Yeah. [LAUGHS] Yeah, man, but you're still tough as nails. What? Yeah, I know. God damn right I am. All right, let's get you out of here. Come on. You all right? [GROANS] [INAUDIBLE] come on. Come on. You good? Yes. Being old sucks, doesn't it? Fuck you. [LAUGHS] My name is Craig Ford. And I am head of a little shit ass agency that I adore, the DEA. So this is how this shit goes down, you know, with the cartels. The average transportation of cocaine has always been problematic for the US. However, they began to take more serious notice when these cartel pricks got into the sex trafficking business. And selling them back into the US for ransom to their parents. The part that really fucks with my head, you can only imagine in your holy hellish nightmare, that's what these girls go through if they don't make it back and they get washed ashore like this little girl did. Anyway, that's how we all got into it. That's how we all got into the mix, Bruce Stryker, the DEA, my dumb ass, and the head of the CIA. But trust and believe this, it's one hell of a story. Huh? Oh. Hey, where are my two DEA agents? They should be standing at the door. Mr. Ford, you've been rushed into intensive care. But I need my men back here. Until I ID you, I'm gonna have to-- take your goddamn hands off me or I'm gonna take that syringe he's holding and stick it up your goddamn ass, all right? Mr. Ford? What? If you could take these pills-- Listen, you'd be a better nurse if you took off your fucking clothes. Anyone ever tell you that? You been to nursing school? [INAUDIBLE] Oh, come on, I'm just playing. Hey, Ford. Those three nurses, they checked out. Your men are in the hallway. You OK? Excellent. Hey. Good to see you, Bruce. You never can be too fucking careful. No, you can't. That's right. Watch your family. Don't fuck it up like I did. Holy Popsicle, look who's here. Uncle Ford. Hey, honey. How are you? Oh. Are you OK? Oh, I'm fine, fine. Enough about me, though. How's your dad's training going, honey? Great. It really is good. You'd be really proud. That's great. That's great. Hey, listen, listen, get me out of here and we'll go have lunch together with Rebecca. All right. It's good we scared them docs off. Hey, your dad and I gotta do something. There's a window of opportunity to get me out of here. OK, hey. Come on, let's go. Just don't forget what I said, all right? If I had half the life you have, I wouldn't have lost Carol and had a pretty goddamn good life. You know? Just don't fuck it up, all right? And you three are all I have left anyway. You hear me? You understand? I understand. So training tomorrow, 0700? God damn right. We got 26 missing Americans. Let's bring that number down by two tomorrow. OK? Yes, sir. All right. Where are my clothes? In the car. All right, let's go. [GROANS] I'll ask the fucking questions! Get this piece of shit out of here! [GUNSHOT] [INAUDIBLE] Back to staging. All right. Get some water. That's what I'm talking about. Good job. Good job, John. Good round, everybody. Bruce, that sucked. If we do work like that, we'll be speaking Russian before Christmas. Unit three. Follow me, move out. Hey, Ford. Hold on for a moment. What? Is it really that bad? Yeah, oh, it's that bad. What do you think? Hey, look, man, I'm the second best guy in the exercise, we have problems, you know? I'm 50 fucking years old. Are you serious? We gotta do better. Much better. 10-4. Let's get these goddamn sparks to fire. [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] cartel. Unit 3, Stryker's got something to tell you. You guys sucked. You guys really sucked. If I [? check ?] that score what Stryker is gonna tell you about was me. I know what kind of people are taking my daughters. He's right, guys. This is a very important mission. We just got some intel that 23 teenage US female citizens were abducted while on spring break in Central America, all related to the drug cartel. This is an epidemic. They all have families that want them home safely. We are the ones that are going to bring them home. We're the only ones that can do it. And we can't do it like that. Now pull your asses together. I want you thinking and I want you killing. Come on. Let's do it. Let's do it. You're better than this. We're all better than this. Let's go. Move out. Come on, let's go. Let's go. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SPEAKING SPANISH] Come on, let's go. Come on, get up. Come on. Get in there, all right? Look at me. Don't be a hero. You're not that valuable to me. No, not my type, sorry. [GUNSHOT] No! [GUNSHOTS] Leave her alone! You wanna die? Keep struggling, I'll shoot you right now. You want to die? I'll shoot you right now. Huh? [GUNSHOTS] [PHONE RINGING] [SPEAKING SPANISH] Let him go. He's one of us. Bring him to me. [HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [GUNSHOT] [GUN CLICKS] [GUNSHOT] [MUSIC PLAYING] Spyder knew he fucked up. But much like a wolf pack, a cartel pack is an exceedingly complex social unit. The alpha of the cartel is a man named Pelon. And the job of maintaining order and cohesion falls largely to the alpha wolves, Pelon being the number one wolf. So Pelon makes the call to release Spyder. Second in command are called the betas. That would be Spyder followed by mid-ranking wolves like Javier, and finally the omegas, or as the cartel refer to as prairie dogs or murder dogs, the ones that do the dirty work. Spyder relentlessly kills the injured prairie dogs. As they say, dead men tell no tales. Ah, fuck it, dead men don't talk. See, what makes this story interesting is the nature of wolves. Any temptation to be an alpha will be the cartel's undoing. Keep watching. It's just a matter of time. [SPEAKING SPANISH] We will no longer travel to Mexico. From now on, we go directly to the US, Florida. Pelon, how are we getting there? [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] Javier. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [PHONE RINGING] Hey, beautiful. Hey, daddy. Hey, sweet pea. Hey, Bruce. We just picked up Allison and we're on the way to the office. But where is it again? Because I need to tell the bodyguard. Seven months, we've been here seven months and you still don't know where my office is? It was one time that I've been and it was for the welcoming party, so-- And one too many margaritas. We can turn around. Look, Becs, I don't know if I'm going to be able to wrap up by the time you guys get here. Maybe you guys should just go to the beach without me. Bruce, you promised. Yeah, come on, daddy, you promised. All right. All right. How can I say no to that kind of love? Bruce, something's happening. Hold on. [INAUDIBLE] why'd you pull over? Get down! [SCREAMS] What was that? Down, down! What's wrong? Allison, down, down! Stay down! Stay down! [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS] [GROANING] [GUNSHOTS] [SCREAMING] Let go of her! Stop! [CRYING] No. Rebecca? [SPEAKING SPANISH] If you want to see 'em alive again, there's a van out front. Get in it. [EXERTION SOUNDS] Take me to my family now. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [MUSIC PLAYING] Where is my wife? Your wife is safe, as is your little girl. They will continue to be safe as long as you cooperate. Why me? I have nothing to offer. Well, since you knew enough to expose our last mission, Pelon expects you to make this delivery. And if I don't? Your wife, your kid, you will watch them die before I cut every one of your limbs off. The last will be your head. But if you work with us, we will let them go. You're fucking insane. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Do not snort the product. Do not fuck the other product. Yeah. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Don't let Stryker play you. Keep him down. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Once the drug wears off, he will kill you like that. We don't need that fucking idiot. Stryker knows how to avoid the authorities since he was their superior. [INAUDIBLE],, Alessandra will be waiting for you in Florida with her grand contact named Dallas. Give him the sample bag as instructed, OK? I got this. Trust me. Let's pray for your sake, [SPEAKING SPANISH].. Hey. Hey, hello? Anybody home? OK, I know you can hear me. You fuck this up for me, your wife and child will never see the light of day, I promise you. Do you understand? Yes. Look at me. Do you fucking understand? Nothing to worry about. I'm not worried. You should be worried. Are you worried? Are you worried? Yes. Good. Take him. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] It's OK, baby. Mommy's here. Ow! What's your name? What's your name? Rebecca. That's a pretty name. Your husband, is he a smart man? I hope so. [SOBBING] [RUMBLING] Daddy, wake up. Come on, daddy. Daddy! Hi, daddy. Hey, sweet pea. Are you excited to go to the beach? Of course. Where's your mother? She's packing. That's good. You remember our promise? Of course. Do you remember which promise? No, sorry, which one? The one where you're supposed to keep me and mom safe. Dad, we need your help. I'm scared. They're hurting me and mom. No. We need your help. No. Dad, come on, help. [GROANS] [SPEAKING SPANISH] You're too young to be in the cartel. Old enough to put a fucking bullet in your head. Like that's the hard part. Get these fucking things off of me. Don't try anything stupid, all right? Don't be a fucking hero. [SPEAKING SPANISH] What the fuck is that? Whale shark if you're lucky. If you're not, great white shark. And that's supposed to scare me? Yeah. Yeah. I remember I was navigating [INAUDIBLE].. Yeah, we used to hear thumps like that. [THUD] This one time a buddy of mine Captain Ken Kennedy and I went up top to check it out. Got up there, I turned around, saw the biggest fin I've ever seen. It was enormous. [THUDDING] It was heading straight for the sub. It hit the sub so hard that Captain Kennedy fell in the water. That shark was on him so fast. It shook him around. It shook him around like a dog with a bone. Tired of this bullshit. Get up. Look, tough guy, go upstairs you're gonna get us to fucking Florida. Figure out your fish situation. [SPEAKING SPANISH] OK. Got a flare gun in this piece of shit sub? Hey. Get out of the way so I can do my job. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Hello? Will you tell your brother to give me the helm so I can do my job? [SPEAKING SPANISH] Here's where things got a little tricky. No one at the CIA knew Stryker did a little favor for Senator Stanfield. It was Stryker's own code of honor that compelled him to do it. Much like the wolf pack of the cartel, myself, the head of the CIA, and its top men, we all had our rank. The difference between the cartel and us-- we don't eat our own kind. Eh, most of the time. Ford? Hey. Hey. Here's five good ones. How are you? Good to see you. Good to see you too. What's up? We've got problems. Um, let me guess, cartel problems. Yeah. I have a briefing with the president in 30 minutes. You guys said this is level one? Yes, sir. My friend Bruce Stryker, he's a highly decorated Naval officer. He's been kidnapped by the Colombian cartel. Everybody knows that, all right? Come on. Tell him. Why is the DEA involved in this? Hey, look, I don't like these assholes either, but I'm their boss, all right? If we want to topple the cartel, then we gotta stop all this bullshit and work together. What the hell was he doing in Colombia, Jim? Oh, he has family down there, sir. Mistress? No, I'm talking about his family. I don't mean there's some old whore, I mean his real mistress, his job. Oh. [INAUDIBLE] OK. Anyway, they wanted him down there after he retired from the navy. Look, I can vouch for him. I trained him, OK? And he is one bona fide bad ass motherfucker with one big bad problem. He loves his family very much and they're gone. Sir, he's a hero. He was awarded the Navy Cross after he saved eight Navy SEALs. He deserves to be rescued. He's earned it. You may not know it, but you are better, you're safer. We are better. Bruce Stryker, he's an artist like van Gogh, like Modigliani, like, um-- like Lennon, like the Stones, OK? And blood is his paint. And the cartel is his canvas. So what do you guys expect me to do about this? Just give us your permission to go and turn over a few stones so that we can help save him. All right, save your buddy. But I don't want your people knowing anything about it. What? As far as they're concerned, he's as big a criminal as the cartel. Got it? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Who's in charge here? I am. Who the hell are you? I'm the one in charge here. Well, you're a real shitty host. [SPEAKING SPANISH] I'm sorry to keep you waiting. Are you bored? I get bored, too. This is boring. I think we could figure out something to do. Pass some time. And I won't tell if you don't tell. So tense. Give in to me. It's OK. It won't hurt. Mommy likes me. She's confused. [INAUDIBLE] And you're gonna [? do it, too. ?] And then the time will go by like that. Huh? Don't do anything fucking stupid. [INAUDIBLE] Get up nice and slow. [INAUDIBLE] Turn around. Oh, shit. [LAUGHS] [GROANS] Mommy! [LAUGHS] You wanna play. You wanna play. Yeah, let's play. All day. You're like that chica in the movie, man. You know the one? The mermaid, you look like a mermaid girl, right? You know the one? You know the movie, right, the Hollywood movie? That's you. Spyder! [SPEAKING SPANISH] The job is to get me my money. Now where's the sub? They just passed Cuba. They're headed straight for Key West. Good, they're making good time. How soon should I travel there? You're not going anywhere? [SPEAKING SPANISH] I'm sending my wife to the location. She'll be staying with my contact in the US. Plus, I need a break [INAUDIBLE].. [SPEAKING SPANISH] She shouldn't go alone. At least she'll be away from you. Oh, you don't trust me, Pelon? I can't trust anyone, especially anyone who's fucking my wife. How do you know? I didn't. I do now. Bap. So how we looking? All right. I've gotta go up top. Sit tight, all right? You're gonna want me to have that. You think I'm stupid? Look, the shark is all over us. If it gets sucked by the propulsion, a shark that size, will snap the metal of the propellers like that. [SNAPS] The shots from the gun will alert the shark. It'll scare it off. Give me the gun. No funny business. I'm a man of my word. No funny business. 10-4. [GUNSHOTS] The shark won't be bothering us anymore. No funny business. We're in the clear. What you doing, pretty boy? I like that. I know these waters. So I gotta ask, where'd you guys get the sub? That's a good question and a fucked up question at the same time, hmm? Yeah. I bet. You and I are not that different, actually. How so, pretty boy? No, that's not how this works. We're not gonna go around in a circle telling our stories like we're at a campfire. I have a family I have to save. OK? I have to stay focused. I don't want to be here. But we are here. But let me get one thing straight, I would do anything for my family. And if you get in my way, I will kill you. [NON-ENGLISH SINGING] Nice fucking voice. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] We make peace? [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [GAGGING] You don't fuck around with a guy like Pelon. He is the alpha. But more than that, his whole life and his father's father's whole life and his father's father's father's founded their family principle on respect. You could say Pelon smelled a rat in the room. And more than that, he could sense a bigger one right outside the door. [MUSIC - RACOON RACOON, "DAWN CHORUS"] And like any great alpha, he knows how to treat his pack-- pardon me, his people. Keeps 'em fed. Keeps 'em warm. Get's 'em laid. [LAUGHS] Oh, and keeps them happy and content, the pieces of shit they are. No disrespect. (SINGING) Across the ocean of our lies. You know what's wrong to be with you. I never felt you wanted to. Like all those parties without fun. Like a summer without sun. You know what's wrong-- [SPEAKING SPANISH] Melissa. [SPEAKING SPANISH] This is beautiful. Gorgeous. This would look so nice on you. I need you to [INAUDIBLE] business in Miami with our big client Dallas. He awaits you on his yacht. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Why don't you go to Miami and meet with Dallas? And then I'll stay here and watch everything. [SPEAKING SPANISH] I trust you. I have to tell you something. Now is not the time. OK. OK, [SPEAKING SPANISH]. (SINGING) Everlasting game, no one ever won. Now it's just you and me apart. Each other with a broken heart. You know what's wrong to be with you. I never felt you wanted to. Like all those parties-- Aye, yay, yay. Don't shoot. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Do you know who I am? I don't give a fuck. Give me the jewels. Get out of the car. Come on. Don't shoot. Don't shoot. [INAUDIBLE] Stupid. My God, Pelon. Do you know who I am? Pelon, I didn't know it was you. [GUNSHOT] [SCREAMS] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [GUNSHOT] Don't worry. It's OK. [SPEAKING SPANISH] You're right. It's OK. I love you so much. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Let's go home. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [RUMBLING] [SPEAKING SPANISH] You still don't trust me. Trust you? [INAUDIBLE] You have one job. Get us to America and you get your family. We get caught, your family dies. You have your family kidnapped. You're an asshole like me. I like that. Hello, beautiful. I want you to know your eyes look lovely today. That's nice. How often that bullshit line work for you, huh? Once, maybe twice. What's up? I just want you to know the informant is arriving now. Now? Now. Our source in Medellin says that a shipment is about to arrive. What's the shipment's ETA? They're bypassing Mexico and coming by way of Key West. So they're going to arrive sometime tomorrow. Your job is to arrive before those two get a chance to escape. Now, I gotta tell you, there's gonna be three undercover CIA agents there to help. Work with them. I know how you feel about those sons of bitches, but you've got to work with them. Swallow your pride. So I can't kill anybody tomorrow. Not this time. OK. See you buddy. All right. How'd it go? Shipment's coming in tomorrow. Opportunity to redeem ourselves, do something right, OK? Get moving. Duty calls. Go! Asshole. Listen, I need you to be brave for me, OK? You mean like dad? Exactly like dad. Will daddy come save us? Will he? Your father's the bravest man I know. And he'll do whatever it takes to come get us. And do you know why? Because we're family. And we're always there for each other. Yes, exactly. So stay strong for me, OK? I'll protect you. What the fuck are you doing? [EXERTION SOUNDS] Come on, big boy. Show me what you got. [EXERTION SOUNDS] [THUDDING] Don't do this, man. Stryker! One phone call, that's all I gotta do. All right, Tom, what do you got? I fold. Oh, man. Full house, king high. Wow. Well, you know what? My house is a little bit bigger than that. Aces high. Oh. You always were quite the charlatan. [LAUGHING] I'm never playing cards with you again. Hey, sweet cakes. Where's my product? Have you heard anything? I just saw it get loaded into the [? pickup. ?] Tell him to take it to the secure dock. We'll meet him there. Well, ain't this a lovely site? Let's go into the dock. Come on, let's get you out of here. Let's go. I assume you're our contact. You betcha. And if I wasn't, you'd be in Hell's Kitchen right now. Let's see what you got. Well, looks like we have a deal. Looks like the end of the line for you, Bruce. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Javier, no! [GUNSHOT] What the-- Take her. Get off! Get off me! Calm the fuck down. [YELLING] It's all right commander, you're safe, CIA. When we heard an American veteran was taken hostage by the Colombian cartel, Richard Bishop called me in. Thank you. And who might you be? Agent Dallas Chapman, godspeed, commander. Agent Bell. Commander Stryker. It's good to see you. Good to see you too, sir. This here is Agent Juarez. Come on, Ford's waiting for you. Oh, shit. I should have known. How was your trip? You look like hell. Yeah, a lot better than you did when I saved you from that cartel sewer. You mean my little pipe and-- my pipe and shower dance with Spyder. Yeah, that's the one. Look, Ford, it's good to see you, sir. Thank you for saving my life again. I assume it was your idea to use Dallas as a mole to save my life. Nope, that was Richard Bishop's idea. Actually, Dallas is CIA, top agent. I was gonna do it myself, but Spyder would ID me, so-- Hey, look, that's enough talk and enough bullshit. We need to get your family back, all right? Exactly. And I need your help. I know. I'm already on it, OK? I'm already on it. I have a swift boat waiting for you and Agent Bell at MacDill Air Force base [INAUDIBLE].. All right, so let's not have their lives lost in vain. Most importantly, let's get Rebecca and Allison home. You know I won't stop until [INAUDIBLE].. What next? Well, you know, Pelon and Spyder are not gonna stop hunting you down. And that means your family as well. This could be just the beginning. Maybe we'll get lucky. [EXERTION SOUNDS] [THUD] Daddy! Sweet pea. Oh my God. Are you OK? I'm so sorry. It's OK. You're here now. I'll get you out of here, OK? Have I told you how brave you are? I'm gonna need you to be brave for daddy, OK? It's not over. I love you. I love you too. OK, come with me. I've got you. I gotta put you down. We're not out of it yet, so stay by mommy, OK? Wait. OK, come on. I need you to trust me. Be quiet and go over there. [EXERTION SOUNDS] [GUNSHOT] What's intel say about security? It's a fortress. It's heavily guarded. Where's my entry? You're going swimming. There's an entry point on the north side. You've gotta swim through the channel. Easy enough. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [GROANS] [SNAP] [EXERTION SOUNDS] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [EXERTION SOUNDS] [GUNSHOT] [SPEAKING SPANISH] No! No! [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SOBBING] [SCREAMING] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [GUNSHOT] It's that simple. Like I said, wolves will turn on wolves. Then Bruce just steps in and takes out the new alpha. I would have loved, I would have loved to seen Spyder's expression. Spyder had just 30 seconds to be the new alpha in their [? shit-driven ?] operation. That's it. Then he's taken out. Just a flash of a moment for Spyder, just enough to pick up a cigar and not even get a chance to light the son of a bitch. [LAUGHS] Yeah, that's it. In the end, a man will become a criminal to save his family. I mean, he will do just about anything. Bruce is the new alpha, and rightfully so. And until every girl is returned and more importantly this cartel is brought to its knees in absolute submission so that Bruce's family will be safe, it will be up to Bruce to run this cartel like it was his own. You could say Stryker would become more than a mole for the CIA and DEA. He is the new alpha criminal of this cartel. And that, ladies and gentlemen, that is just what the boys back home in Washington had hoped for. God bless America. [MUSIC PLAYING]
