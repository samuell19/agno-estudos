What does the map say? The map says... that we are out of phone range. We're gonna be fine. Look where we are. We're on an adventure right now. Just out of curiosity... what time does the sun set? Mm... I'm... I'm planning on not brushing my teeth for the entire trip. You will be... you will definitely be brushing your teeth. - No, I don't think I'm going to. - Oh, yeah, it's happening. - No. - If I have to knock you out and do it myself. You're gonna brush my teeth while I'm unconscious? - Yes. - That's very nice of you. - I never knew you loved me so much. - Oh, yeah. What are you doing? What are you doing? Stop it. - Stop it. - Ooh! - I'm gonna turn around, pee on you. - No, no! - Uh, babe. - Yeah? I think it is official... we are lost. I... I don't feel lost. Do you feel lost? Are you tired? You're tired, aren't you? I know you're tired. - Hey, open your eyes. Open your eyes. - Yeah, they're open. They're open. I need to stop for a second. Let's just... you're right. We should just stay out here. We'll get a little bit of sleep and then... I can't wait to start shooting this thing tomorrow. I bet the stars are pretty tonight. - Holy mol... - What? Okay, I'm signing up. We're in. I'm never going back home. That's it. Wow. This is the place, right? - Oh, my God, my back. - It's so charming, isn't it? Ugh. Whoa! Oh, my... it's perfect. Hey, I was thinking you and I can start a nudist colony here. - What do you think? - Um, sign me up. Yeah? Sign you up? Oh, my God, there's a rocking chair! - Oh, my... - This is... this is... - Oh, my... - This is incredible. It's insane. Wow! - I think you're scaring the birds. - Uh-oh. Do you ever wish your life had an eject button? Good morning. I'm happy to report the sun rose again in the east today, - right on schedule. - Do you ever fantasize about selling everything and moving to the woods? Do you ever dream about waking up to birds instead of your alarm clock? Have you ever wanted to blow all your money on extremely nice camera equipment to make a nature documentary so beautiful, people who saw it would never want to watch another movie again? Good morning. I think I found nirvana last night, 7:43, and I was standing right there. Do you wish you could walk around your yard naked? Do you ever wish you could freeze time? Do you ever wish you could kiss your wife the way you did on the night you first met? Well, the sun rose again today. A bird flew by. A squirrel ate a nut. So this thing... you're... this is recording you while it's recording me? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Pretty sweet, right? I have one fabulous, genius boyfriend. Have you ever started to suspect you made a huge mistake? You're so smart. Mwah. Have you ever realized you were in over your head? Have you ever realized you can't really go back? Whee. Well, it's interesting out here. You know, being in the woods is... Have you ever moved to the woods for a whole year to work on your relationship, only a month in you missed your TV more than you thought? Plus, you stopped taking your meds and you have no idea what this movie is about in the first place. Let's face it... trading in your studio apartment for a bunch of trees - doesn't really change anything. - Come on. What are you doing right now? What if Penny put her photography career on hold for you so you are too ashamed to admit that the documentary you moved here to make wasn't that well thought out anyway? What? But what if your real problems are much, much worse than that? You haven't shot anything for weeks. - Penny. - Hey, come on. Stop. What if your relationship troubles are the least of your worries? Doesn't want to get out of his hammock. - Doesn't want to film anything. - Oh, all right. - I don't know why. I don't know why. - All right, I get it. What if something else was out there? - I love you. I'm just not in the mood. - Why aren't you in the mood? Can you open the door now, please? Oh, my God. Something that hadn't been disturbed for a long, long time. What if you came to the woods to find solitude, only you found out you weren't really alone? I'm sorry about earlier. I shouldn't have yelled at you like that. It's fine. I... you... I think you were right. I just... I needed to shoot some stuff. And I really need a swift kick in the ass, that's all. So thank you for that, seriously. Mm, that's nice. Isn't that nice? I think we just needed some relaxation time, you know? Let me give you a massage. Come on, let me give you a massage. Relaxation time. Free massage on the house. What are you doing? - Giving you pleasure. - No. I mean, what's going on with you? Nothing. I'm good, all good. Are you good? Honestly, I'm... I'm kind of... I've been worried about you. You don't need to be. Just relax. No, you've been acting - really alarmingly... - Yeah. In the last couple of... I know. I just... you know, I... I just... I stopped taking my pills temporarily when we first got out here. But I'm fine. I really... - I'm really loving... - You stopped taking your pills? No, I... no. Uh... I gave up everything to come out here with you. I left my job, my friends. And you promised me... you promised me - that you would be responsible. - Yeah. You know what, Penny? Let's just go to sleep and talk about this tomorrow, okay? No. No. I want to talk about it now. Scott. Scott. Aw, come... Babe. - Babe. Scott. - Hmm? Hmm? - What is that? - What? You hear that? What? What the hell is that? It's nothing. What the...? Turn off the light. Turn off the light. What is it? Jesus! Jesus. What is that? What is that? - What is it? - I don't know. I don't know. Are you... - are you all right? - Yeah. What the hell's going on out there? Okay, just stay there. I'm gonna go take a look. It's... it's just birds. It's just birds. Shit! - Why are they flying into the house? - I don't know. Why are they flying into the house? - I don't know! - What are we supposed to do? I don't know. They're just... they're not gonna... - Jesus. - They're just birds. They're not gonna hurt us. - Everything's okay. They're gonna be... - No, stop... So... it's day 52. And... Penny and I are... It was good. You know, last night was good. Sometimes you just gotta let the blood out, you know, just get the passion... passion pumping, you know? When you come out to a place like this, it's like there's this huge wall just... That's where it's at. It's really good stuff. You know, it's... Hey. Hey! Hey! Hey! You have my car keys! Hey! I have to show you something. - Scott, Jesus Christ! - I'm sorry. There it is. Jesus, whose house is that? Come on, come on, come on. Can you believe this place was right under our noses? - Okay, come on. - Scott, wait. Scott, what are you doing? - Scott, Scott. - Hello? - Let's go. - Shh, hold on. - Come on, this is stupid. - Shh. Excuse me. Anybody here? Whew. Okay. - All right, come on, let's go. - Hello? - Scott. - Shit, where's my backpack? Okay, I'm leaving. - Is someone here? - Just come on. - Just come with me. - I don't want to, Scott. Just come with me. - What the hell is this? - Shh. Shh. What the hell are you looking for, Scott? Scott. Whoa. Okay, come here quick. No. - Just come in here. - Why? I need you to be my lookout, okay? - Oh, uh-uh. No. No. - I... just... just... Penny, wait. Just... Penny. Penny. Penny. Penny. - Come here. Just come here. - Scott. No, Scott. - Shh. Come here. - Whose house is this? I don't know. It's just some squatter guy. I just... I have to go down there for a second. - That's all, okay? - Go where? - There? - Yes. Why would you want to go down there? Why did he take your backpack? What's down there? I left... I left the keys in there. - You what? - Yeah. - That's a 10-mile hike to the road. - I know. I already know, okay? I'm an idio... Don't go in there, okay? This is the most interesting thing I've seen in a month. Just let me know if he comes, okay? Scott. Scott! Jesus. Scott! Scott. Scott. Holy shit. Holy shit. Holy shit. Shit. Jesus. Wow. Wow. - Oh, my... - I found it. We've got to get out of here right now. - Come on. - Okay, hold on. - Wait, Scott. Have you seen this? - No waiting. We've got to go. No, no, no. Have you seen this stuff? - We've got to get out of here. - Wow. Wow. - This is like... - Shh. - This can't be what I think it is. - We've got to get out of here. Wait, what's in here? Is this his studio? - We've got to go. - Hold this for one second. Just hold it for one second. One second. One second. Come on, take it. Got it? Oh, my God. Penny, this guy could come back any second. Wait, wait. Let's look at this. This is... let's see what's in here. - Penny, serious... - I think it's stuck. Come on. Jesus. Wait. Stop, stop. Shh. - Okay, come on. - What? Stop, stop, stop, stop. - Wait, what? Let's go talk to him. - No, wait. Wait. We just broke into this guy's house. You think he really wants neighbors just, like, dropping by? Penny, come on. Come on. Shh, shh, shh. Stop, stop, stop, stop. Shh. Penny. - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. - I know. - Oh, my God. - I know. I know. - That just happened. - I know. It just happened. - That was incredible! - I know. I know. He's a total... - No, Scott. - He's a total psycho, right? - No. No, Scott. No, Scott. - He so is. I thought he was gonna... - And, like, act out his fantasies. - Jones. It's Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones! Are you positive this is where you saw him? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, definitely here. I'm pretty sure he came out here. You know, no one's ever been able to figure out who this guy is. - He's crazy. - Yeah, shh. It's like we're living next door to, like, J.D. Salinger or Banksy. Shh! Hey, Scott, we have got to go back down in that basement. We gotta take more pictures, you know? We could do, like, a full, like... like, a huge, like, - full-color-page coffee table book. - Okay, you gotta... I think tomorrow you should start interviewing some of these guys, you know? - What? - Yeah. I'll make you, like... I'll make you a list, you know, of, like... of his curator or the guy that wrote the monograph for him at the MOMA. - Yeah. - You're gonna have to go to New York. - What? - You're gonna have to find these guys. They're in New York, basically. You know? But what, are you gonna stay here? Well, I mean, I think I... I think I have to, right? I mean... I mean... - what do you think? - Yeah, yeah. I think it's good. Holy shit. There's another one. I'm standing right next to Mr. Jones' scarecrows. I'm totally staying here. I've got... I've got way too many pictures to take. Insane. - This guy is disturbed. - You know what? I could also shoot some footage for the documentary. It might be kind of interesting, actually, to have my perspective and your perspective at the same time in the film. What do you think? I mean, only if you're cool with it, 'cause this is your thing. - Yeah. No, it's good. I like it. - Yeah? Yeah? I think it... cool. Well, um... Don't worry about me. I'll be fine. Uh, I left you a message about possibly interviewing you later today. - I'm just... the first time I'm... - Yeah? Okay. All right. So... and then we'll just have you sit right here. - All right. - And... why you're interested, but... you don't have to tell me if you don't want to. Why do you run your website if you're so afraid of him? To help people. You ready? Testing. Blah, blah, blah. Master's degree in both consciousness studies and alternative medicine. And I'm working on my dissertation at the University of Somewhere. So where do you want me to start? Tell us about how you discovered Mr. Jones. Okay. So one day, early '70s, I ran a gallery in the Village, and I get this huge crate in the mail. You could have fit a refrigerator in there. I open it up, and there is sitting there, inside, this thing. I started to get reports about these people getting these packages all over the country... a dentist in Oregon, a bartender in Iowa. I had no idea why these people were being singled out, but it intrigued me. And I go home and I have about five drinks. And I go to bed. I can't get the thing out of my head. I just couldn't get it out of my head. Finally I wake up from this dream where I'm actually having a dream inside the dream about finding it. Nobody knew who he was. Nobody still knows. There were all these crazy rumors... he was a concentration camp guard who was hiding out in Georgia. He was on death row. It was a housewife in Ohio. He was a mental patient. He was a dentist in Washington State. He was... Mr. Jones. That was me... I named him. I was pretty angry at the world at this time. I was about to go broke. So I just hung this thing in the front window of the gallery. And it stopped traffic. When I first saw Mr. Jones' famous scarecrows, I immediately thought of totem poles, tribal masks, guardian figures that occur in every culture who stop the evil spirits that dwell in the dark from breaking into our home. So what happened next? Um, well, eventually they just stopped. And that was it. And I thought Mr. Jones was done. So you think you got an actual piece sent to you by Mr. Jones. I don't think I did. I did. I mean, most experts think he sent these things out in the '70s. How do you know it was real? It was real. I know it was. There are nine verified Jones pieces in the world... nine. If someone found an authentic Jones, I could get seven figures for it tomorrow, easy. But if it was a new piece, any new piece, contemporary, like what he's doing now... whew. If these are worth so much, then why did you destroy it? I met a lot of people that were mailed totems by Mr. Jones. And most of them just say that they were disturbed and moved on. But if you actually start talking to the people around them... their husbands, their wives, their friends, their colleagues, their parents... then you start to get a different story. Why do you think he singled you out? I have no idea. And you dig deeper into the lives of these people, and you noticed even more drastic changes, extreme personality shifts, disappearances, housewives leaving their families and moving into the woods. It's disturbing. Who do you think you're dealing with? I'm sorry? Do you think this is, like, a painter or something? You have no idea who you're dealing with. This guy... you don't know what he's capable of. And he's still out there. He's sending these things out to innocent people. And we don't know why or we don't... nobody cares. Nobody's doing anything about it. You've got no idea what these things do to your mind. What... what do you... what do you mean? They get inside your mind and they explode. Okay. Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system. 323-379-4499 is not available. At the tone, please record your message. When you are finished recording, you may hang up... Hey, Penny. It's me again. I don't know if you're still not getting any reception or not, but if you're getting these, I just want to say good night. Hope you're being careful. I miss you. I hope you're not ruining my documentary... Hey, babe. Um, I'm here. And you are... who knows? Somewhere in New York. Um... and I miss you. No sign of Mr. Jones, but I've been taking a lot of pictures. And... I don't know, these things seem so familiar... hypnotic. Still not sure if you're getting these, but just please be careful, okay? I've been hearing some kind of disturbing things about this guy, all right? Just don't go into the woods until I get back, all right? Oh. Hi. I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm Penny. Sir, I think your work is amazing. And, um, I was... I was actually just taking pictures, 'cause I want to create a book. Um... Um... You know what? Would... would you be okay if... if we did an interview maybe? Um, I just am so inspi... Uh, or, you know what? I'm... I'm... I'm sorry. Uh, maybe I'll just... Scott, you need to see them in the dark. It's like the air around them is... is vibrating. Scott? Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No. No, no, please. Please. Please. Please. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh, my God. Okay. So I just feel like I need to record this before I forget. 'Cause I feel like I just woke up from a dream, you know? Um... You know... you know how in a dream you... you can tell if someone is trying to hurt you or help you? Like, you know, you can... you don't just see into them, you see, like, right... right through them, you know? Huh. It's like I could... I could feel his intentions. You know? And I don't feel scared. So-called primitive people didn't see the world the way we do. They thought the dream world was real, not some meaningless neurological side effect of sleep. There was the waking world of order, cause and effect, time and space... and another, a very real world that you glimpsed in dreams. Hey. Oh, I'm so glad to see you. It is hard to believe that one person, after so many years, could be responsible for building all of these totems and sending them all over the world. So there's some that posit that perhaps there is a secret group or sect at work here, building these things and sending them out for ceremonial purposes. These talismans were created by the holy men to patrol the borders of these two worlds as they overlapped, kind of where the photo dissolves into another, to keep the chaos and insanity and nightmares of the dream world from entering our own. Maybe they're working together. Maybe they're all on their own. Maybe they're all inspired by the same dreams. It's almost as if the Mr. Jones mythos has a life of its own, constantly striving to survive by feeding on our imaginations and in the process occasionally transforming people into additional Mr. Joneses. So what happened after you got the statue from Mr. Jones? It's not really a statue, is it? Okay, then. What should I call it? There's not really a word for it. So what happened to you? I started having a nightmare. So what would we see if we saw this other world? Depends on what we bring to it. An inverse reflection of our own... madness, bedlam, paradoxes that will split your mind. Can you tell us about this nightmare? Um, I'm chasing myself. I'm trying to hurt myself. And if I catch myself... it's gonna spill out and infect the whole world. So this is a dream you have, like, every night? You don't understand. I started having the dream. I haven't stopped. So what would happen if these guys failed at their job? You could forever be lost in the purgatory of these two worlds or have the courage to see yourself as a whole in both worlds... the awake world and the dream world. Tell us a little bit about the troubles you've been having in your life. No, I don't think I want to talk about that. Like, I know you guys think you're telling, like, a fun little story, but you need to stop. Don't talk to anyone else who's had contact with him. Don't try to track down his works. Don't look for him. And if you think you have found Mr. Jones, don't speak to him, don't listen to him. Don't... don't go near him. And if he comes near you... run. Look, we do have to be careful, but, Penny, that guy I interviewed obviously had problems. I mean, everyone else I talked to... if they found out we found Mr. Jones, it would be huge. If we're really gonna make this documentary, we gotta explore that basement. And you gotta take pictures of his workshop. I feel like we only saw a tenth of that place the first time. It would be the perfect ending for this movie. Yeah. - Penny. - Yeah. You know, we'll use walkie-talkies. I don't know, like, keep an eye out for him so he doesn't, like... what? What's up? They're gone. Wow. Oh, my gosh. I... I don't know. I can't. I can't really... I can't really explain it. What happened here? This is incredible. Just, you know, tell me... tell me what you were telling me before about how it was a dream. That was really good. This is so trippy. I mean, if he's using these as scarecrows, then... I felt like he was leading me home, you know? And... whatever he's... It was like he was... he was trying to get me away from... from whatever he's trying to scare away, you know? Whatever he sees out... Penny. You okay? They're so familiar. Okay. Okay. Okay! So I'm just gonna go in there for, like, two seconds. I'm gonna come right back. Okay? Everything's... everything's gonna be okay. Okay. - Okay. - Okay. Whew. One, two, three. What the hell? Okay, I'm definitely in the basement. I can hear you. It's all clear outside. Okay, good. All right. Okay, I'm at the hatch. Jesus. Okay, there is a ladder. And it goes down. Okay, I'm going down. Okay, just be quick, all right? I forgot the camera. Okay. Okay. Oh, my God. There's like a whole 'nother level down here. Wow. This is crazy. All right, Scott, checking in. How's it going? - Scott? - Yeah, I hear you. Looks like it goes on for miles. Scott, be careful. Don't worry. I'm fine. This is crazy. This way? Okay, so this way. Can you hear me? Penny, can you hear me? Can you hear me? Scott, you're breaking up, all right? You're... You're breaking up. I don't know how he finds his way around this place. There's... this is... this is a total maze. I see a light. Penny. What? Oh, my God. Oh, my... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa. This place is... this place is huge. I'm... Penny, can you hear me? Man. Oh. Wow. Oh, my gosh. Look at that thing. I've never... I've never seen anything like this. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Scott, Jones is here. Scott. Scott. Penny, if you can hear me, this place is crazy. Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott. Scott, Jones is here. I mean, there's torches and there's these... more of these big scarecrows and there's this little guy. Get out now. Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott. I wish you could see this. Jones is in the house. Jones is in the house. Get out of the house. Screw it. Just get out of the house. Oh, my God. Scott, get out of that house. - Scott, Scott. - Penny, can you hear me? Penny. Penny. Penny, I really need you right now. I really need you to hear me right now. I don't know where the fuck... What? No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. This can't be happening. I was just here. Penny. Penny. Whew. Okay. Whew. Okay. Pull it together, Scotty. Pull it together. Okay, that was real. It's all in your head. This is all in your head. What? What the hell? It can't be a dead end. I was just here. That's impossible. That's impossible. Penny. Penny. Penny. Shit. That's impossible. That's not the way. You're freaking out. What the hell was that? This is not happening. I know where it is. I know where... oh, man. Oh, my God, that's it. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Penny. Penny, this isn't funny! Where are you? Penny! Penny! Penny. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Holy shit. Holy shit. Penny. Penny! Jesus. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Penny! Penny. Penny! Penny. Penny. Go. go, go, go, go. Just go. Just go. Penny, Penny, it's locked. Open the door. - This is not working. What did you do? - Nothing. Nothing. I'm not doing anything. He's doing this. - Jesus Christ! - All right, all right. Whoa, whoa. Get out of the car. Get out of the car. You hear that? Get back inside. Get back inside. Get back inside, go! Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go. - Mr. Jones saved me from the woods. - What are you talking...? He's out there right now terrorizing us. You think he's saving you? It's like the first time when you weren't here. He's saving us. - Pull it together. - He's trying to tell us something. - We have to leave. - We can't leave. It's a 10-mile hike in the middle of the night. Will you just listen to me? Listen to me. - We are not safe in this house. - Shh, shh! I don't know what's wrong with it. The battery's fine. Everything's fine. It just doesn't work. In the morning we'll get out of here, okay? Okay. When does the sun rise? 6:30, I think, right? - Mm-hmm. - Hey. Everything's gonna be okay. It'll be okay. It's gonna be fine. It's okay. It's okay. What happened to you out there in the woods? - I don't know. - It's okay. I just woke up here. It doesn't make any sense. He's doing something to us. I wish I hadn't gone down there. I mean, it was... sick. I'm sorry. About what? Everything. You don't have anything to be sorry about. As soon as it gets light... we run. It's gonna be light out soon. It'll be a nice walk in the woods. We're gonna be fine. What time is it? 6:15. We've got about 10 minutes before we gotta go, okay? - Mm-hmm. - Let's get ready. Penny. We're gonna be fine, okay? Scott, why isn't it light yet? It's just a storm. It's 8:00 in the morning and it's midnight out there. That's not a storm. Hey! Don't worry. I'll get us out of here. What time is it? It's 9:30. The sun's gonna rise soon. Jones is... he's here. - No, Scott. - Hey! - Scott, stop. - Hey, leave us alone! Wait. Wait. Where are you going? - Hey! Hey! Get out of here! - Scott. Scott. Hey. Can you help us? Tell us what's going on. What is it? Holy shit. What the fuck is that? Are you okay? What? What? What? What are you looking at? What are you... what do you see? Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. What do we do? What do I do? - Open the door. Open the door. - What? - Open the door. Just open it. - What? Just take it. - Open the door! Open the door! - Take it. Take it. Scott! Where is he? Scott! Scott. What happened? Scott. - Scott? - I don't know. Oh, my God! Penny! I don't know how long this night has lasted. Hours? Days? My mind's getting cloudy. There's some... there's something in the woods. It... it does something to your... your head. I can feel things inside. I can feel things watching me from inside my own... Where's the other flashlight? It's in my backpack. Scott, what is this? Just something I took from the basement. Why did you take it? I don't know. You need to take it back. I can't go back down there. Scott. What is this? Scott. Did you shoot this? No. Create a book. Um... We gotta explore that basement. Well, I mean, we can keep trying to talk to him. I just keep having this dream. I'm just... I'm gonna go to sleep. Okay? No, Scott. I left my job, my friends. You promised me that you would be responsible. I just keep having this dream. To see the world from another's eyes, to be in a nightmare and never to be able to wake up... that kind of fun stuff. You should start interviewing some of these guys. - Yeah, yeah. I think it's good. - Yeah? I just keep having this dream. I can't really... It's so vivid. I wake up... in this blue room. And I'm watching myself sleep. Why did you take it? I don't know. - Where's that coming from? - Where is it? Where's that coming from? Where's the camera? Penny, where's the camera? - Listen. Listen. Listen. - No! We're not safe here! No, we're not safe out there. We have to leave now. - Listen to me. - Scott. He's not helping. He helped me out of the woods twice. What do you think he's doing now? We can't. What, are we gonna stay here? We're gonna stay here and be slaughtered? Yes. Penny. Penny, stop. Stop. Turn around and talk to me. Come on. Penny. Oh, my God. I know what they're doing. What? What the hell are you talking about? The birds. They're trying to get away from what's out there. She's lying. The dream world, the nightmare world... can't you feel it? - Everything is loose, dreamlike. - Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it! - You're not making any sense! - Can't you feel it? What is it? Mr. Jones was keeping it out. He was doing just fine and then we messed it up. For all we know, Jones is doing this. Didn't you see what happened to him? What we did to the scarecrows and then when you went in the basement and took his stuff. You're just making a wild guess. Jones is gone. Scott. So who's gonna protect us now? Huh? Stop! Scott, don't open that door. Don't, Scott. Oh, my God. Shut the door! Go to the bedroom. Get the mask. Get the doll. Put them in the backpack. Ah! Penny. Penny. Open up. Open up, please. Shh. I think it's gone. Scott. Scott. We have to get out of here. Scott, the other world... it's coming over us. It's time to wake up, sleepyhead. This is not the room where you told me you cut your face. Scott, this is really... this is really happening. This is real. Wake up! - Scott, don't look at the other ones. - No. No, please. You're stuck in a nightmare. Look at me. The thing you took from Jones' basement... Scott, Scott, look at me. It was important, okay? Scott, Scott, I'm right here. Wake up, Mr. Jones. Scott. We have to get out of this house. And we've gotta go through the woods. We have to go in the woods. We have to go in the woods, okay? Scott. I know. I know. I know. We have to go in the woods. I don't want to go in the woods! Okay, come on. Come on. Go, go, go! Run! Penny, this way. Penny. Penny. Penny. Penny. Oh, shit. - Scott. - Penny? You have to go in his basement. You've got to go back down there. Scott. You have to put on the mask. You need to put back what you stole. - Penny? - Scott, we have to take it back. Scott, don't look at her. Don't look at her. She's not Penny. - Scott, come here. - No, no, no, look at me. Stay with me, okay? Don't go near her. You need to put back what you stole. She's lying. - She's lying. - She's not the real Penny. I never came back to the house. Scott. Scott. Do not put on the mask. Do not go back down there. You have to put on the mask. You have to put on the mask. Jones... Jones unleashed the nightmare. She's trying to trick you to destroy the scarecrows. Do not put it back. Oh, shit. Oh, my God. Scott. Scott. Scott. Scott, help me. Scott. Scott. Please help me. Scott. Help me, Scott. Scott. She's got me. This place is huge. There's these torches here and these massive scarecrows. And there's this... there's this little guy right here. Oh, man. I wish you could see this. Oh, man. They thought the dream world was real, not some meaningless neurological side effect of sleep. Jones is gone, Scott. So who's gonna protect us now? There was the waking world of order, cause and effect, time and space. You have to put on the mask. And another, a very real world that you glimpsed in dreams. Wake up, Mr. Jones. These talismans were created by the holy men to patrol the borders of these two worlds as they overlapped. It's your turn. You have to stay behind, Scott. To keep the chaos and insanity and nightmares of the dream world from entering our own. So why do you think he did it? Maybe he thought he was a shaman, warding off evil spirits, protecting this world from destruction. You have to put on the mask. You have to protect us, Scott. ♪ If you say that I'm restless ♪ ♪ You're far too kind I find ♪ ♪ And I'm running in circles ♪ ♪ And it's taking up all of my time ♪ ♪ If you can't understand ♪ ♪ Then you don't know ♪ ♪ I'm not one to stand up and fight ♪ ♪ And as for the plan ♪ ♪ I'm a-making ♪ ♪ I hope that it's right ♪ ♪ 'Cause all I need ♪ ♪ Is you ♪ ♪ And on my feet I will land ♪ ♪ Everything I know ♪ ♪ Keeps falling right out of my hands ♪ ♪ You make it seem easy ♪ ♪ You take what you know ♪ ♪ And go with the flow ♪ ♪ No need for direction ♪ ♪ Traveling where the wind blows ♪ ♪ It's a mystery to me ♪ ♪ How you do it ♪ ♪ You get through it without blinking an eye ♪ ♪ And if you're the test ♪ ♪ Man, I blew it ♪ ♪ Least I gave it a try ♪ ♪ 'Cause all I need ♪ ♪ Is you ♪ ♪ And on my feet I will land ♪ ♪ Everything I know ♪ ♪ Keeps falling right out of my hands ♪ ♪ You live your life without a care ♪ ♪ You toss up a coin ♪ ♪ And you call it in the air ♪ ♪ It isn't easy ♪ ♪ It just isn't fair ♪ ♪ It's hard to play the part ♪ ♪ When you're not there ♪ ♪ Thought I needed you ♪ ♪ But that's not part of the plan ♪ ♪ Just like most everything ♪ ♪ You fell ♪ ♪ Right out of my ♪
