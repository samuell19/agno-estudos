She stuck her tongue out at me! I waved at that little kid and she stuck her tongue out at me. Boy, if I could get off this bus, I'd go back there and punch her lights out. Why are we stopping here? Hey, Chuck, we've had a blowout or something. I'm going to bring down her window shades. I'm going to dim her outlook and shorten her life span. I'm going to rearrange her landscape. On the other hand, I didn't know she was going to bring her gang with her. I'll confuse her with a silent but dignified retreat. I don't believe it. What are we doing on this ridiculous trip? Look! Nothing around us for miles. This is crazy! I feel like I've been hijacked. Go ahead. After you. Snoopy, don't stay back too far. From here on, it's pretty rough country. Hey! Hey, don't forget me! Come back! Come back! You forgot me! We're all going to die! Watch out! Aah! Oh, no! Oh, watch it! Aah! Ooh! Aah! Oh, no! Oh! Aah! Aah! Oh, no! Ah, watch out! Aah! Aah! Aah! Why can't I have a normal dog like everybody else? Hey, kid. Watch what you're doing. You pushy, or something, kid? What's your name, kid? Charlie Brown. Hey! Get a load of this kid with the weird name! Charlie Brown! What are you here for, Brown? Have you come to camp to try and be a man? Attention, everyone. Attention. Line up for your registration forms. Fill in all questions, including your reasons for coming to camp. I was wrong. I haven't been hijacked. I've been drafted. OK, kid. Knock it off. You're making too much noise. Did you see that? Did you see what they just did? - Well, I, uh... - They insulted me! Slug those guys! Show 'em their place. Give 'em a knuckle sandwich, big brother. Look, kid, get this, and get it good. We run this camp. We were Number One Tent two years ago, and we were Number One Tent last year, And we're gonna be Number One Tent This year, too. - Now, look here. - Let 'em have it, big brother. Hey, guys. Get this. This kid with the round head wants to rumble. Go get him, Brutus. Yeah, you're so smart, you bullies. Wait till my brother's dog gets here. Boy, he'll show you. Here he comes. He'll take care of your dog. Go get him, Brutus. What seems to be the trouble? Look, kid. Get in line and mind your own business. Back! Back! Back! Isn't he the cutest thing in the whole world? Fastest blanket in the West. What a trip. Here we are doing a paper. We could have stayed in school. Don't worry, kid. They just want to find out something about us. They have to know what sort of things we like to do. I'm going to put down a lot about baseball. They'll probably make me captain of the team. How come they don't have trips where you just stay home? If you want a better way of life, Marcie, you always have to cross an ocean. Or a desert. Or a mountain. Sometimes, however, your whole life can be changed by crossing a crowded room. That's a romantic thought, sir. Is it original? I don't think so. And stop calling me "sir". Hey, Chuck, give us a hint. What did you write? Well, I don't know if I should. It's kinda personal, you know. Oh, come on, Chuck. We're close friends, you know. Well, OK. "I decided to come to camp because I've ever been much of a person. I thought coming to camp would help me grow up and maybe even make me into a leader." I could use leadership qualities. You can say that again, Chuck. You couldn't lead a dog on a leash. Attention, everyone. Attention. All campers must be in their tents by 2200 hours. I've never made a bed in my life. Do they have directions? By the way, it's a little chilly in here. Where's the thermostat? Hey! We're supposed to be roughing it. There's no thermostat in a tent. OK, gang. I suggest we run this tent in a democratic fashion. The first thing we'll do is elect a tent leader. We'll have to prepare some ballots. And we'll do this democratically. We'll vote to see who's leader. One gal, one vote. However, we can't pass the ballots until we've voted to see who's going to pass the ballots. This will be done very democratically. Let's see... I vote that Lucy prepares the ballots. Wait a minute. You can't vote unless we have ballots. If we can't vote to see who will pass the ballots, how can we have ballots to vote? Yeah! Who cares? All in favor say "Aye". - Aye. - Aye. No! No! It's settled. Lucy will pass the ballots. OK, Lucy. Pass the ballots. Everybody mark their choice. Either vote for me or against me. That'll be fair. Wait one darn second. How about if we nominate somebody first? Good idea. I nominate me. Any further nominations? If not, the nominations are declared closed. OK, gals, let's vote. Marcie, pick up the ballots and tally them. All right, Here's the way it went... One vote for Lucy, one vote for Peppermint Patty, one vote for Sally, and one vote for Marcie. Hmm, a tie vote. I guess I'll have to cast the deciding vote. Huh? The deciding vote is for Peppermint Patty. Peppermint Patty is the leader. I am the leader. It was fair and square. Boy, some vote. As the elected leader, I propose we get busy and make the beds. Hey, one moment there. I propose we vote on whether we do or do not make beds. Marcie, prepare the secret ballots. Now hear this! Now hear this! Tomorrow morning, everyone will rise at 0500 hours. What's 0500? Noon time? Nope. It's 5:00 in the morning. 5:00 in the morning? I don't get up at 5:00 in the morning. Maybe I should resign. Hey, how about that? A waterbed. Boy, this is great. They really know how to treat a leader in this outfit. Boy! I get a waterbed. I tell you, this modern army is great. OK, troops. Let's get some shut-eye. This will be an experience. You know, I hate to admit it, but I can't go to sleep without having my mother come in and kiss me good night. I know what you mean. It's always easier to go to sleep if someone comes in and kisses you good night. Oh, good grief! Ugh! Ugh! - Quit pushing! - Ow! Sir, you're making too much noise. Can't you kiss him good night and let it go at that? If I ever get off this waterbed, I'll kick him not kiss him! Marcie, help me get off this waterbed. Aah! Aah! Ugh! I think it's time to get up, sir. Marcie, I know it, and will you please stop calling me "sir"? Attention! Attention! Turn out for PT! Turn out for PT! Attention! Attention! Turn out for PT! All right, troops. On the double. On the double! Turn out! What's this now? The infantry? Sir? PT? What in the world is PT? PT is physical training. You know... Exercise. Come on. Let's go. Hup, two, three, four. Hup, two, three, four. Hup, two, three, four. Hup, two, three, four. Hup, two, three, four. Hup! Hup! Hup, hup, hup! Hup! Hup! Hup, hup, hup! Nothing like a little workout to build up an appetite. A rousing breakfast is a good way to start the day. All that exercise made me lose my appetite. Do you think we could transfer out of this outfit? Hup! Hup! Hup, hup, hup! Hup! Hup! Hup, hup, hup! If you want a wallet, why can't you just go to the store and buy one? Aah! Attention! Attention! Lunch will be served at 1200 hours. I like the chow line. Blurgh. It's like I told you, kid. We're number one and don't you forget it. Back! Back! Back! Now hear this... Tent competition will now begin. The first event is tug of war. Tent number one against tent number 13. Good grief. That's us. Hey, that's us! Yeah! We're number one! * It's a new day * * You're about to face a test * * It's a new day * * You've got to do your best * * But if somehow * * you don't come out on top * * keep on tryin' * * 'cause we're behind you, Charlie Brown ** We're number one! Yay! We're number one! Ready... Set... Go! This is the dumbest game I've ever seen. Come on, Marcie. Up and at 'em. You can do it. - You know what, sir? - What? I wasn't born to be a potato. I can't do it! Sure you can, kid. Just keep at it. That's it. We're going to catch 'em. Hey, they're cheating! We're number one! We're number one! We're number one! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! The next event in the competition is the good one. We won it last year and we'll win again this year. You bet we will. It's a sure thing. We'll really have to work to beat those bullies. They win everything By cheating. Attention! Attention! The main event in tent competition will start tomorrow. This will be the raft river race. - Yay! - All right! Prepare your rafts by 1800. I wasn't even born in 1800. Linus, we don't have a chance. I've just seen their raft. No wonder they win this race every year. I just checked out their raft. You can't believe it. Direction finders. Radar. Sonar. The works. This is going to be a pushover. This is the easiest competition we ever had. Yeah, we'll walk all over 'em. I think we loaded the raft too soon. Our tubes aren't inflated yet. Where can I put my piano, Charlie Brown? Gee, I don't know, Schroeder. Wherever you can find room. We don't have room for a piano. Well, then, if we're so short of room, maybe we shouldn't take your blanket, either. Put the piano right over there. Ready? Ready. Aah! All right. All together now. One last poof. One more time. That will show them a thing or two! I'd love to see their faces in the morning. We'll show them who runs this camp. We'll show them who's boss round here. Those villains stole our air. Quick, Marcie. Hand me the air pump. Here I want to be a good leader, and I see nothing but failure ahead. Don't fret, Charlie Brown. As they say, it's not if you win or lose, but how you play the game. This is gonna be a cinch. They're just a bunch of softies. That round-headed kid is a joke. We'll wipe 'em out. Attention! Attention! All participants to your rafts. How come didn't he say, "Gentlemen, start your engines?" On your marks... Get set... Go! See you later, dummy. Yeah, in about two weeks when you finally get there. What's the matter with the stupid engine? Come on! Come on! Let's go! I think... I think... I got it! I got it! Let's go! Let's go! - Stop! Whoa! - Hey! See you suckers later. Everything in this raft will be run in democratic fashion. See that fork in the river? We're gonna vote to see if we take the right fork or the left fork. Lucy, prepare the secret ballots. Now pass out the ballots. Everybody mark their ballots. OK, Marcie. Tally the ballots. One vote we go right. One vote we go left. One vote we go right. I know my vote. I vote we go left. Good grief! That's a tie vote. What's the matter with you? How can we have a tie vote? Lucy, pass out new ballots. The vote is whether we get off the reef or not. Marcie, tally the votes. One vote to get off the reef. Two votes to get off the reef. Three votes to get off the reef. Four votes to get off the reef. Well, at least this is a unanimous vote. I'm glad I'm part of such a democratic system, sir. This all restores my faith in good government. OK, gals. Let's get the raft afloat. Hmm. I'm scared! I hope those lions and tigers out there mind their own business. Don't worry, kid. Nothing out there to worry about. You know, gang, I have a feeling we're going to win this race. I think we have too much muscle for 'em. I want to be with Linus. I'm scared. Sally, there's nothing to be scared of. I don't care. I just wish Linus were here. Don't forget me, Linus. If we get in trouble, I'm depending on you. Oh, good grief. Of all the rotten luck. Stop talking and push! Hey, who do you think you are? Come on. Let's push. Push! * Campground behind * * Wilderness calling * * Nature strumming * * All around * * Do do do * * Doodle do do do do do do * * Do-do do do * * Taking a current direction * * we're expectin' * * to get down * * To the end of the end * * Of the end, of the end of the line * * Makin' our way down the river * * No thought of turnin' around * * Following the greatest leader * * Charlie Brown ** Hey, Chuck. What about this? You think we should go up this alley? If the sign says so, that's what we should do. But it seems to take us away from the main stream. There it is in black and white. I think we should do as the sign says. Besides, I just saw Snoopy disappearing around the bend. Come on. Let's go on. That's funny. Did you see that sign? Hey, Chuck. Did you see that sign? What day is this? That's right. Today is Tuesday. Chuck, did you see that sign? What time is it, Chuck? It's almost... 10:00 a.m.! OK, Chuck. Another fine mess you've gotten us into. Look at that. The channel is all blocked. Yeah, just like his head. Hey, look! They're still ahead of us. Let's go get 'em! Let's go! Let's go! What kind of place is this to be lost in? We can't even plug our iron in. And now the news about the big storm that hit this area yesterday. Heavy rains have caused flash flooding in the back country. Travelers' advisories call for extreme caution for all travelers. Gee. I hope the other kids are all right. I haven't seen any of the other rafts. I wonder how Snoopy's doing. You lazy bums! Help me! Get back there and push. Get back there and push, yourself. So you want to get tough, huh? I guess I'll have to teach you a few manners. Take this! Hey! Look! We've got to catch those other rafts. We're gonna lose if we fight with ourselves. Yeah, we've got to get this raft back in the water. Pull! Pull! I'm pulling! I'm pulling! Hey, look! There's Snoopy's raft! They're gone! I see the boys on the beach, sir. Shall I hail them? Hey, they're looking at a tube. Maybe they got a flat. Hey, there! You need any help? Hi, Chuck. What are doing on the beach? I think Snoopy and Woodstock are lost. This is their raft, and we can't find them. Hey, troops, You hear that? Snoopy and Woodstock are lost. Lucy, pass out the secret ballots. The question before the group is do we join Chuck on the search or do we hunt on our own? Mark your ballots. Good grief. What's going on here? Marcie, tally the vote. One vote for we go it alone. One vote for we go with Linus... Well, I think Linus needs me. We should all join Linus. Oh, good grief. One vote we go it alone. One vote we go home. The vote is in. The mandate is clear. We go it alone. OK, Chuck. We'll help in the search. Your team goes that way. My team will go this way. Come on, troops! Let's find 'em! Follow me! Hey, watch it! Look out! Ow! I recommend caution while we're in this rocky region. - Huh? - These rocks are a perfect breeding ground for rock snakes. What in the world is a rock snake? When it sneaks up behind you and throws a rock at you... Boy! They're not too dangerous, though. Most of the time, they hit you on the lower part of your legs. Snoopy! Snoopy! Snoopy? Hmm... Not here, either. Hey, Snoopy! Hey, Snoopy! Linus, where are you when I really need you? Relax, troops. We got to get a hold of ourselves. It's only bears and tigers out there... and they're as frightened of us as we are of them. Let's face it, troops. We haven't found Snoopy, and now we're just as lost as he is. But let's keep moving. Keep together, troops. Snoopy! Snoopy! Snoopy! Snoopy! I think this would be a nice place to rest and also use as headquarters. We could fan out in search parties until we find Snoopy. Yeah, till we find somebody or they find us. Hey, look at that. I see smoke! A chimney! Troops, we've been found! Yes, can I help you? Hey, Chuck, it's me! Chuck, we found you! You were lost, kid, but we're here now. No! We weren't lost. You're delirious, kid, but we found you and now you're safe. Say, how about that getup you got on, kid? Don't tell me you're doing housework. This is a pretty ratty house you got here, Chuck. OK, troops. We found Chuck and he's very grateful. I'm sure he's going to give us a vote of thanks. Eh, Chuck? Well, Chuck, ain't you got any manners? Are we gonna stay out here all night? Come on in. We're just about to have dinner. Will you join us? Hey, you got quite a place here, Chuck. It won't offend you if we stay with you, will it, Chuck? Hey, Chuck. What's this, dry cereal? For dinner, dry cereal? What's the matter with you, Chuck? Don't you know anything about camping? Where's the corn willie? Don't you have any C rations or K rations? OK, troops, at ease. Let's have a meal with these guys. But tomorrow, we'll treat. Boy, tomorrow we'll show you guys. We'll show you how you're supposed to eat when camping. Hey, Chuck, I'm getting to like your shack. It sure needs a woman's touch, though. Hey, Chuck, look at this. How about this? Charmaine. I don't suppose you even know what a waltz is, do you? Well, uh... I guess it's a... Hey! Hey! - Hey! - Hey! - Hey! - Hey! Hey! Are you going to ask me to dance, too? I think perhaps I might ask you to dance if you were the last girl on Earth. Schroeder, are you going to ask me to dance? Musicians don't dance. I wonder if anybody's going to ask me to dance. Boy, that kid really can dance. And he sure knows how to make a girl happy. Isn't it strange how things work out? Here we were. We were all lost, and we were all separated. And for a while, it looked like we might never see each other again. It even looked like some of us might never get home again. And now here we are all together again in a safe cabin by a warm fire. You just never know how things are gonna work out. It sort of makes you think. What's he talking about? I don't know. I wasn't really listening. Oh, he was saying something about the fire. I honestly don't know. I never really ever listen to anything he says. Look, Chuck, instead of all this serious stuff, how about a campfire song before we hit the sack? Um... Hey, maestro! How's about a little tune to liven up the evening? That's what I like about you, Chuck. You really know how to throw a party. * She'll be comin' around the mountain * * when she comes * * She'll be comin' around the mountain * * when she comes * * She'll be comin' around the mountain * * She'll be comin' around the mountain * * She'll be comin' around the mountain * * when she comes * * She'll be driving six white horses * * when she comes * * She'll be driving six white horses * * when she comes * * She'll be driving six white horses * * She'll be driving six white horses * * She'll be driving six white horses * * when she comes ** Well, troops, it's time to take a vote. Prepare the secret ballots, Lucy. What's wrong? Why the ballots? We'll do it in a democratic fashion, Chuck. We'll vote to see whether you guys sleep outside or we sleep inside. OK. Lucy, pass the ballots out to the gals. Wait a minute! What about the boys? This is a democratic outfit, guys. We vote on all activities, us gals. If you guys want to vote, get your own ballots. OK, gals. Vote. Mark your ballots. Good grief. OK, the ballots are marked. Marcie, tally the count. Vote for guys outside, gals inside. Vote for guys outside, gals inside. Vote for guys outside, gals inside. And I know my vote. It's for guys outside and gals inside. Great! A unanimous decision! Chuck, you guys pick up your junk and move out. Hey, wait a minute! It's cold out there! Besides, we found this cabin, and we were here first! Look, here. You saw the vote! It was done legal and straight. Do you believe in democracy? Well, sure, but... Well, Chuck, this was a democratic vote and it says you guys are out. All you guys, pick up and get. This cabin is off-limits to you. Out! Out! Out! See you guys tomorrow. OK. If that's the way they want to play, we'll sleep outside. Come on. Let's make camp. Back! Back! Back! The worst storm of the past decade has struck the high mountains. Travelers in the high country should put on chains immediately. Put on chains? Being lost up here in the middle of nowhere isn't enough. We gotta wear chains too! Good grief, Sally. Don't you know anything? They're talking about mountain climbing. Mountain climbers chain each other. So if one falls, they all fall. Boy, are you dumb. OK, troops. Time for chow. Let's go find the guys. Maybe they got breakfast started. Hey. Reminds me of Christmas. Maybe we should pick out a Christmas tree. Great. Let's get a big one painted red. No. I want one of the short, fat ones. From up here, we get a good view. Let's pick out our trees. Hey! It's Chuck and his gang. Chuck, what's going on? What are you guys doing burrowing in the snow? Look! You took our cabin, and we froze out here all night. OK, fellas. Let's get some breakfast. Great idea, Chuck. What's for chow? Well, Chuck. You've done it again. Cold cereal. We need a hot breakfast. Where are the hot cakes? Where are the bacon and eggs? Where are the huevos rancheros? Now, just a minute! Nobody's asked your opinion! If you don't like what we've got, you don't have to eat it! No offense, Chuck. Just a natural feminine reaction to a most deplorable situation. We were saying, Chuck, that now would be a good time to get us a Christmas tree. Yeah! I was saying a good, big red one would be the thing. There are a lot of nice fat ones, too. Christmas trees? Are you crazy? We're supposed to be having a race. Have you forgotten that? We're number one! We're number one! Yay! See you jokers after we win! See you around! Come on! We've got to get back in the race. We're number one! We're number one! Yay! Quick. Let's form a chain and get the raft. Hurry, hurry! Form a chain! Get the raft! Get the raft, Chuck! Don't miss it, Chuck! Swim for it! Get it, Charlie Brown! - Aah! - You blockhead! You missed it, Charlie Brown! He missed it! We've lost the race! Aah! Chuck, you can't do anything right. I'll save it. I'll get the raft. You'll do it, Peppermint Patty! Peppermint Patty did it! She saved the day! We've lost the raft! And we've lost the race! Help! Lucy, prepare the secret ballots. What's the matter with you girls? We're freezing and you're talking about secret ballots. The question before the group is whether we allow the boys to join our party or we leave them. Didn't you hear me? We're freezing! Chuck, it's all very democratic. Either we leave thee here to rot, or we invite you to join us and help celebrate our victory. OK, gals. Mark your ballots. Marcie, tally the votes. A vote to have the boys join us. A vote to have the boys join us. Another vote to have the boys join us. And my vote will make it unanimous. OK, you guys, welcome aboard. Gee, that's really big of you. Oh, come on, Charlie Brown. We can't waste time. We've got to catch up with those boys. OK, Chuck. I hope you're happy now because I've decided you're going to be our leader. You should start leading us, Chuck. If you're a good leader, this is what you'll do. Yeah! If you're going to be a leader, start leading! A good leader always listens to his followers. All right, I'll be the leader. I'll try to plan our strategy. I see that one of our competitors is passing us. What do you intend to do about it? You're the leader now, Chuck. You're the leader and you'll tell us what to do, and we'll do it. Come on, Chuck, lead. Lead, Chuck. Lead. That's the way, Chuck, yeah. Get up there in front. That's it, Chuck. You're leading. Boy, what a leader. Lead on, Chuck. That's enough! The boys will paddle on either side and I'll steer. That's it, Chuck. You tell us. We all follow. Hey! There's that screwy dog behind us! Hey, where did he come from? There's a short cut ahead, Chuck. Steer right. That's it, Chuck. You're leading. Boy, what a leader! Lead on, Chuck! Chuck, you've taken the wrong turn! Chuck, you blockhead. It's the end of the road! We're stuck! We'll never get down! And we've lost the race! Well, I'm the leader. I guess it's up to me to climb down and free this wheel. We're doomed! Help! Help! Help! Help! We're doomed! We're doomed! Help! Charlie Brown is going to save us. Save us, Charlie Brown! It's moving! It's moving! We're all going to die! Are we dead? Thanks to Charlie Brown. I'm not dead? Of course you're not dead. No thanks to old Charlie Brown. All right, all right. Let's go to the river. I certainly hope so. I see open water ahead. We must be heading for the river. Ow! I think. I think. I got it! I got it! Let's go! Let's go! No! No! No! Are we OK, Chuck? This water looks kind of rough. If you can't handle the leadership, Chuck, I'm here. Lead us, Charlie Brown! Chuck, you've led us into a typhoon. Do something, Charlie Brown! Please! Lead, Charlie Brown, lead! Yeah, we're number one, you bullies! Boy, Chuck. You really know how to lead. You got us ahead of those bullies. Hey! Only Snoopy is ahead of us. Charge, Chuck. Charge! OK. OK. If you'll just calm down, I'll do something. If we're gonna catch up to Snoopy, we're gonna have to paddle. The boys will start first watch. The girls... Just one second, there, Chuck. Lucy, prepare the secret ballots. The question before the house is, do we paddle the raft or do we float with the current? Now, wait a minute. You've all made me the leader. I'm going to make the decisions. Men, take the paddles and paddle. You gals duck down to ease up on the wind resistance. Now, ready... Paddle! Paddle! Paddle! Paddle! Paddle! Paddle! Paddle! Paddle! Paddle! Paddle! Paddle! Chuck, you're doing it! I see the finish line! Chuck, you're leading us to victory! There's no one in front, Chuck. Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hey, we've lost our leader. We've lost the crew. - Help! Help! - Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! We're number one! We're number one! Yay! This'll show 'em, once and for all. Yeah! Time to give those creeps a real lesson. They shouldn't have tried to beat us. Nobody beats us ever. They deserve whatever they get. We're number one! We're number one! We're number one! Yay! We're number one! Yay! Oh, no! Turn around! Help! Now what do we do? Don't worry. They'll never get through. Hey! Yay! Yay! The winner! The winner! The winner! The winner! To the winner of our annual river raft race, this trophy. Congratulations, champ. Well, kid. You guys put one over on us, all right. But just wait till next year. OK, move along, now. Everybody into the bus. Hey, this has been good for you, Chuck. You've developed real leadership qualities. Well, lots of things have happened to me, and I'm glad I did what I did. You know, I was never sure how I would stand up under pressure and how I'd make decisions. I feel good about myself for the first time in my life. I think now that dumb things won't happen to me anymore. I feel like I'm more in control. Hey! Don't forget... me! Snoopy, the bus took off, And they forgot me.
