[suspenseful music] [grunting] He won the WCW championship when? 2000, 2000, it is 20 fucking 19. [grunts] David Arquette, David Arquette. I'm sick and tired of people like David Arquette. He's never been trained. He's a fucking joke. I'm sick and tired of people taking a piss, out of my business. The new WCW, World Heavyweight Champion, my man, Mr. David Arquette. But you should better than to trust someone from Hollywood. [upbeat music] [bell rings] COMMENTATOR: What the? What is it? Did David Arquette just. What's going on here? David Arquette won the world title. [upbeat music] What up? David Arquette winning the WCW championship-- Well I'm gonna make this pretty short. It was crap. An untrained, 150 pound Hollywood actor won the professional wrestling most prestigious championships. There's a whole locker room full of guys in WCW, they'd all be incredible world champions. Out of all that, you pick David Arquette. [I'm not buying it. He doesn't have the size. I don't know what the hell they're thinking. They basically made their title meaningless, when they strapped it around his waist, it meant nothing. I don't give a shit about David Arquette. Like you can't walk in here, and think you're gonna do what we do every day. David Arquette as a wrestler sucks. [upbeat music] [crowd cheering] REVIEWER: Man, it's not like David Arquette, is our favorite Hulk Hogan, or Ric Flair, or Dusty Rods, he was a joke. He was in frickin "Ready to Rumble". NARRATOR: I'm here to tell you a story about a man created by God. No, a man created by Hollywood. Not MacGyver, not Vin Diesel, not Stallone, not Shwarzenegger, I'm talking about David Arquette, the man is invincible. He was in "Scream 1", "Scream 2", "Scream 3", and then they did "Scream 4", he's coming back as a goddamn Cyborg. He was in "Ready to Rumble", he was a WCW champion for two weeks. He was on "Eight Legged Freak", who rebelled giant spiders, giant spiders for God's sakes. He was out doing "See Spot Run", but only because he needed the money. And that's why, you cannot kill David Arquette. [upbeat music] You cannot kill David Arquette. Alright, well first of all, I like David Arquette. Number two, he came into the dressing room area, which was like sacred ground to all of us. That he had been in the business, and he was a gentleman. INTERVIEWER: Did you give him your blessing? Did I give David my blessing? As a person, yeah of course. INTERVIEWER: As a wrestler? No, let's not get carried away. He's my hero, if I'm looking at his wife [laughs]. I've never seen "Scream", which is insane. In fact I covered "Scream 4" for the Insider, and I still didn't see the whole movie, 'cause I hate scary movies so much, I freaked out. David and I met on an 80s boat party. But before that, I went to NYU, I was a journalist, I interned for Hillary Clinton. I worked in local news, on air for more than a decade, and won an Emmy, and ended up on "Entertainment Tonight". And yeah, when I had my kids, I left being a news reporter. And now I'm kind of getting back into it, and I'm going to Arkansas soon to produce my first feature film. Okay, so just call me back and let me know if we need to troubleshoot it some more. We have the three kids. We have Coco, my stepdaughter, who's 14. Charlie is four, Gus who is 15 months, so it's a circus. And we have three Basset Hounds, it's really insane here. I always joke actually, it's not three kids, it's four. There's Coco, Charlie, Gus and David. It's a lot of kids in the house, running around. [dog barks] Lady, no. As interesting as wrestling is, he feels like kind of crossing over into that world caused a lot of directors to not necessarily take him seriously. She is really good, isn't she? Culminate to people who wanna do things differently. We could get off the street. CHRISTINA: At the start of David's career, there was so much promise. I mean, he was playing sophisticated roles, and he was on this really good trajectory. And then in the late 90s, he was on the cover of The Hollywood Edition of Vanity Fair, with that elite group of movie stars, like Leonardo DiCaprio, and Matthew McConaughey, and Will Smith. And those guys have all gone on to be the biggest movie stars in the world. And I think David has a lot of sadness around the fact that he could have been that. But instead, he went on to do the "Scream" movies, and he kind of became typecast as a goofball. And that's what everyone remembers him as, the cop from "Scream". I've got to knock off a couple more to get that title. CHRISTINA: It was also around this time in his life that things started getting weird. And I think his involvement in wrestling was kind of that last straw. People did not get it. They thought he was crazy, and it really hurt his career. [upbeat music] Present time my career has been pretty crappy. I mean, I've been auditioning for like 10 years without actually getting a role. So that's like 10 years of rejection, like who who does that? Who would go through 10 years of job interviews, and not get any, and still go out and get another, I have another job interview today? It's crazy. We met on "Scream 1", we hated each other "Scream 2". We got married "Scream 3", and we got divorced "Scream 4". That's some of the roughest wrestling I've seen. I used to go to wrestling matches with him, and he'd get so excited. [crowd cheering] Yeah, I would say it was a lot to handle, to see David at this point where I was on "Friends", and everything was feeling pretty good with our careers, and all of a sudden he wants to start wrestling. I don't know, just he looked like he should have been in "Earth, Wind and Fire", but instead he was going to wrestling matches, and he was loud, and it was kind of insane. I remember feeling embarrassed, 'cause he was just, there's nothing small about the way he embraced wrestling. World Heavyweight Champ, baby. [laughs] Yeah, right. What's so funny. David, David, David, you're not a wrestler. Can you show a penis or no? What network is this, or whatever, penis friendly environment? These are some Alexis' paintings. Toothless, look at David. Good looks. Good looking. Too many dead people in this book. Our mom was a writer, and a poet, and a teacher and loved mythology. And our dad loved puppetry. He loved to play the ukulele, and we all had clown noses. It was a very colorful childhood. I mean, there was a lot of playing with David, and wrestling with David. Okay and the handball punch, and you crumble to the ground. That was the reenactment. [Patricia laughs] Dave was like, in my periphery, wrestling, like that's a joke, but it was like something little kids were watching, and I was kind of surprised by it, honestly. It was kind of the first major left turn. David wants love, and they never gave him the proper love for him showing up in that world. I was the Heavyweight Champion of the world. Thanks to my buddy, Eric Bischoff. [incidental music] There were certain rules, one of which was don't let celebrities come in and take advantage of wrestling. Don't expose the business, by making it look like anybody, celebrity or non celebrity. Anybody could come in off the street, and actually beat a wrestler. COMMENTATOR: And look at this, look at Trump, Donald Trump. The fact that you won the belt is what broke the unwritten rule. You never do that. You didn't know the culture, but that wasn't your fault, that was my fault, for letting it happen [laughs]. You can blame me. [David and Eric laugh] The idea was tossed around to get David Arquette involved, and get him in the ring, and he would get us headlines, and I'm not really sure whose idea it was, I think Was Vince Russo's idea originally. Did it accomplish what you wanted? It accomplished exactly what I wanted. You're on the cover USA today-- Thank you. All the newspapers-- Yeah. You transcend wrestling, which is that very-- Well not transcended it, right then and there, I think I killed the business forever. I loved wrestling as a kid, like it was something I followed, and I was obsessive about it. So when I was part of the whole wrestling thing, I was kind of like, just a kid in a candy store. I mean, like seeing it behind the curtain. Then it all became like really intense, and like you know what I mean? You find people spitting at you, and throwing shit at you, and just like saying the worst things you could ever hear. The plan would be just to sort of clear my name in a sense. And through the process, honor wrestling. You know what I mean? I don't wanna be smear on its history. So we're going to Detroit, and I'm gonna talk to Brian Knobbs, one of the two members of the Nasty Boys, to see if I can make an appearance at his Legends of Wrestling event. ♪ We are the Nasty Boys ♪ ♪ We got a bad reputation ♪ ♪ When you see that Nasty-- ♪ Like their theme song says, the Nasty Boys have a reputation for being the bad boys of wrestling. So it's gonna take some convincing for Brian to let me fight. ♪ We're the boys-- ♪ They're wrestling tomorrow, me come in somehow, if I can get approved by the commission, the crowd would be hot about it, you know what I mean? It'd be a start of a thing. You've been gone for a while now, so-- I know man. Two days before, and-- I got you, I got you. I'm not being a dick about anything, I'm just doing business. DAVID: This fucking asshole. What you talking about? BRIAN: That's my partner. [mumbling] Do any of you wanna talk? I'm sorry bro. There's a lot of history attached to this whole thing. That's kind of the story, that's why they got so heated. Histories, years and years of families, generational history coming up, people destroying their bodies for this love that they have for wrestling. So then the chosen few that become real champions, and like not me, but real guys that have given their lives for, they're 40 years old and seeing their knees are gone. You know what I mean? I understand it. I got it. [audience cheering] I think a lot of wrestling has to do with pride, and heritage, and legacy. That's why people got really upset about, that I was an outsider. I don't really care about being a champ, or anything like that, I care about respect. I never got to wrestle. I mean, I got to take some bumps, and move the story along, but they never like, I never got a chance to do anything that the fans would enjoy. I would love to just sort of figure out this world, that's really what I wanna know. What is wrestling about? Why do fans love it so much? Why did they get so mad at me? I'd love to be able to wrestle, trained, properly trained. I wanna train with the real trainer, and just prove myself in some way. And that's sort of the thing, I'm an actor, I wanna become a wrestler. They didn't really let us do anything. I just had to buy a ticket and go in by myself. CHRISTINA: You're a sensitive person. So why are you putting yourself through this? Yeah, I mean, it's like I'm not part of the family, which I get it. But you're kind of not, I mean, don't you understand that? Sorry [laughs]. I'm a carnie at heart, I'm a carnie. [plane engine roaring] You had two stents placed in your coronary arteries, of the heart, to prevent blood clots from forming inside the stent. You are taking two blood thinning medications, and somebody punches you in the face, or head, or belly, or anywhere. You could bruise and, or bleed quite easily. Internally? Right. Now what about like if, like a 300 pound guy jumped on me? Is there like a chance of like-- Well that can do a lot of damage. I don't know if you can wear a helmet during-- [laughs] That would be a funny gimmick. [laughing] Are you a fan of wrestling? Not really. No? [laughing] [soft music] CHRISTINA: His anxiety is crippling, and what his psychiatrists found is, a lot of people when you're anxious, you're able to like actually calm yourself down, but David's always in a state of such anxiety, that he never can really calm himself down. Throw it at me, dad. No, no, no. I mean, there is an element that nobody really wants to grow up. You wanna like, I love the way kids see the world. I hate growing up [laughs]. KID: What's your name? David Arquette. Hi, David Arquette. I'll be damned mama. [soft music] INTERVIEWER: How is the drinking going? Are you able to control it? Or are you just completely out of control? DAVID: No, I control it. I mean, I have my wild nights once in a while, but-- INTERVIEWER: Right, and are you an alcoholic? DAVID: Yeah, I am, I guess I-- INTERVIEWER: You're a functioning alcoholic. DAVID: I guess so, yeah. INTERVIEWER: If you have children, if you have family loved ones and so on, is there a degree of selfishness to coming back, if you're an addict, into that world again? DAVID: I try to keep, the addict inside me in check, and also the self critical voice in check. I started drinking more, just sort of like I was unhappy. I wasn't being true to myself. OPRAH: Yeah. Just to recap David, real quickly how this sort of works. So ketamine sort of gives us a rapid antidepressant effect, and it'll give us sort of a window of opportunity, where your mood is a little bit more manageable, and you feel a little bit lighter, a little bit better. Maybe a little bit less prone to like kind of fall down that hole that you're kind of starting in. Keep up keep up with positive thinking because we're gonna give the infusion of ketamine now. Yeah, yeah. So-- Yes, yes, thank you guys, this thing is so dope. I'm awesome. I love you so much. This is the fucking game. And it's so fucking dope. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, guys, guys, guys, guys, ketamine. We are so, love is love. Life is life. I'm happy you're happy. No, stop it mother fucker. No. Okay David. Stop, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. CHRISTINA: Lay down my love. David we need to lay you down, come on buddy. Rest, good job, just rest. Just relax. Sit back and relax. I've got to put the monitors on. Yeah, just relax okay. Ketamine is what we call a dissociative anesthetic. Psychiatrists, and medicine is using it now, for its rapid and acute antidepressant facts. There's a lot going on with David. There's a lot going on both sort of psychologically/ kind of personality wise. Also kind of childhood wise, also brain wise. So this is David's brain, sort of at rest, when he was just sitting in the scanner, and not engaged in any particular task. What's notable about this scan is that the anterior component of his frontal cortex, is smaller than would be expected. And sometimes that can happen with psychiatric conditions. Also, it can sort of be the result if there's been any damage to the brain, in terms of like a car accident, traumatic brain injury. CHRISTINA: Which he had, yeah. MICHAEL: Frankly, his results are like very complex. CHRISTINA: Yeah, it was like layers and layers. Yeah, yes, I guess the take home message for David is that his brain isn't connected in a typical way. Our grandfather, Cliff Arquette, was this comedian Charlie Weaver who was on "Jack Paar's Show", and "Hollywood Squares". And then our father, Lewis Arquette, was a character actor. He had parts on "The Waltons", and he would do commercials. My family moved to Virginia, to move to a commune. They started it with a bunch of their friends, and they wanted to kind of build this little utopian society. And David was born there, on the commune, no electricity, no bathroom, I don't think there was running water even. I mean, my dad had a lot of issues. My mom had a lot of issues. She was abusive to us when we were little. I mean, she choked me to the point once, where I started blacking out. I think David was impacted by feeling like he needed to be the perfect son, and cannot fix it, being the best kid in the world. You just can't. DAVID: My dad was just like my favorite funny person. He died when I was 29. I loved watching wrestling with my dad, and he actually did the voice to Jimmy Superfly Snuka, and he was one of my favorite wrestlers. You take one more step toward her, and you'll see why they call me Superfly. [phone ringing tone] So I have this promoter who called about me doing a signing in Richmond, Virginia. So I'm gonna call him back. CHRIS: Hey man, how are you? I'm good, I'm so excited. Thanks for thinking of me for this thing. CHRIS: Absolutely man, we've got the signing going on for you. Then we've got RXW, we've got you there it's one of the hottest promotions on the East Coast. Thanks man, well I'm excited. I'm not sure I'm allowed to fight yet, but I can maybe get in the ring, and crash talk someone. CHRIS: Yeah man, we can't wait to see you. Okay, you too. Alright brother. Bye. Okay, I guess that's good. I'm not ready to wrestle right now. I'm in no shape, one thing I don't wanna do is go back into the ring unprepared, not with the right music, and gimmick, and costume, and persona, and who is it? Who am I? So we'll see how this goes. It sounds a little shady. Can you help me with, I have to find some costumes. So this is like a fire retardant suit, but this is not exactly the kind of thing I'm looking for. And these are my Blockbuster Awards. The Drama Teachers Association of Southern California, High School Film Festival, Individual Humorous Award, second place [laughs]. Oh look, Kanye. Yeah, Yeezy, Yeah, Yeezy. I think this is the one with the, yeah, oh yeah. So this is crazy wizards cave, and I think if I take this collar off, I can do like a Ric Flair kind of. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's a good one. [imitating Ric Flair] [upbeat music] Hello, hi. We've got a client. Hi there. I'm David. Hi David, I'm Craig. Hey Craig. Mario, nice to meet you. What's up Mario? What are we gonna do for you? I'm going to a wrestling, like a signing convention, and I need to sign pictures. Amazing, really? Yeah, yeah. Alright. Can you help me? Yeah. Good, you are godlike. You are the man. ♪ I know nothing stays the same. ♪ Yeah. ♪ But if you're willing to play the game ♪ Alright David, move this way one step, perfect, perfect, right there. Awesome, now look at my light and position. And on three, hold on one, two and three. Oh my goodness! We got some flame action. This elbow here. Okay. And this goes underneath here. Chin down, chin down, perfect! The other hand off like [grunts]. [Craig laughs] Perfect, you are the best photographer I ever worked with. Thank you so much. ♪ Then you break a window ♪ Dad, well this is like the dumbest idea I've ever heard. One you're dressed up like a wizard. I know, it's too wizardy, I will take this off. Oh my God! It's gonna be huge, right? ♪ I know nothing stays the same. ♪ ♪ But if you're willing to play the game ♪ I'm just kind of sick of being a joke to be honest with you. If you're part of the joke, it's not as painful as if you are the joke. Hollywood doesn't take me seriously. The sort of media thinks I'm a bit of a joke. I mean, a lot of these people haven't seen what I could do in a ring. [upbeat music] Okay, come on Scooter, let's go. [upbeat music] [soft music] He killed the business, and a black belt that a guy like Ric Flair, or Herley Race, Steam, Ricky Steamboat, hell honestly pisses me off. 'Cause the guys that rode the roads, and do what we do right now, busted their ass for their families. You know how many times I've missed Christmas, with my family, how many times I've missed anniversaries? And a guy from Hollywood, gets to hold the greatest title in the world. How much are they? Ten I think. Thank you. Yeah, that's so cool, thank you man. You got it? So tonight we're going to a backyard wrestling thing, but it's a real match. You know what I mean? So I have all these magic tricks, like I have this like big stick I can make appear out of nowhere. But it's pretty big, and then I could hit him with it. 'Cause it's the first person that's invited me really. David has got a passion for this business, and I like to see him succeed in making a return to this sport, and having fun doing what he loves to do. And if I can do anything to help him, to get him where he needs to be, I'm gonna do it. [engine revs] [car hoots] I mean Smudger Man mainly went with the elbow, of the top-- Yeah, right, off the top rope brother. And man I miss him, I miss the-- DAVID: I do too, he was so great man. Yeah, right, snap that slim jim, right? Yeah. You know these guys granted, they don't know what they're doing. You're gonna be back in business again. Thank you. Brother, you're gonna be in the ring, redeeming yourself. [upbeat metallic music] David Arqutte's gonna learn a little thing about respecting the business. Alright, when he steps in this yard with us, we're serious about what we do, he's gonna learn. Paying dues in order to get where we are. So this is it? Look, you got me, okay. Okay. It's backyard wrestling company, but the main thing is here. We're here to have fun. Alright, you cool with that? Yeah, I love that fun, I mean, I'm in the fun business. Awesome, so what I just need for you to do is get changed, whenever you're ready, come on out. I didn't think there was gonna be like thousands of people anyway, but I don't think there's anybody here. They're just a bunch of kids having fun, and I like to have fun. So we'll be silly, we'll have fun. I'm trying this new gimmick out, so it's time to unleash the Magic Man. Introducing first, making his way to the rings from Prince George Virginia, Elijah Wade. [crowd cheering] Let me hear you one more time. [cheering] [upbeat music] Come on Eli. ELI: No, no, no. CROWD: Come on Eli. CROWD: Let's go, let's go. CROWD: Holy shit! Fuck you. That's right, you tell him. So the ring collapsed at the bottom, so what we're gonna do, is we're gonna jack it up, get some two by fours, and some tires, and we're gonna get this thing back on the road again. You crazy bastards have been jumping and flipping all over on this damn thing, and there was never a bolt there? I was in jail when this was built. [crowd laughs] It's comforting, it's comforting. He's the NPYWA International Heavyweight Champion. This is the extreme massacre, Corey Jegere. [upbeat metallic music] He is a former WCW champion, he is David Arquette. CROWD: Shut up, dude. No, I am the Magic Man. [crowd booing] CROWD: Are you serious right now? I though you guys-- I am the Magic Man, Hollywood magic. CROWD: Oh my God-- I'm a star baby. CROWD: This is sad David. You're not a real champion. You're not a real, this is sad. Fucking pussy, get in here. Respect me, get in my ring and respect me. CROWD: Don't kill yourself. Oh my God! Can you do this, can you get in the ring? Magic Man made his acting career disappear. [upbeat music] [crowd cheering] The magic got me big money. My magic is epic. [crowd cheering] He's choking. Let's go Hollywood, I thought you wanted this! This is what you want right? To come back into wrestling, right? CROWD: He ain't ready. CROWD: He's not ready. [upbeat metallic music] CROWD: Throw that piece of trash out of here. He's back holy shit. Let's go, come on. Let's go, come on. Get in here. CROWD: I think he's done. Bro, bro I think he's done, seriously. Holy shit, oh damn. CROWD: Let's go. Oh, crap. Come on. Holy shit. Oh my god. CROWD: Oh my god. [groaning] CROWD: Oh damn, no he's not. Bro. Oh my God! Holy. No. No, no. No, no, no. CROWD: That's right Hollywood. CROWD: Are you serious right now. Are you alright brother? [soft music] I feel like we gave him a microcosm of wrestling, like if he wants to really get in, he dealt with a shitty promoter, who gassed his head up. [laughing] Gave all the promises in the world, and he came in here, and got his ass whooped, and didn't even get paid. If that's not wrestling, I don't know what is. I hope he can learn about what wrestling really is, and get that heart for it, and come out here every day like we do. I really hope he does. Are you serious about getting back in this sport? Yeah. Do you, I mean, seriously? Do you want to do what I do? Do you wanna do what Ric Flair does? Do you wanna do what Jimmy valiant does? Do you wanna do what's in your heart to do? I do. Okay. Now let's get you some friend. [upbeat music] Don't make me get an edge show you what to do. 'Cause you ain't gon like it if I got to get in there and do it. Drop down, leap forward. I know I need training, And last night was like a big example of that. I mean, I learned the hard way that you have to train. You have to wrestle with professionals, I mean, if you wanna do it right. Alright boys, y'all ready? Let's do it. And you'll get to feel force. You'll be doing this, doing this, all over sudden, you know what's next, just nice and easy. So that's number one. Okay. [Trainer] Y'all need to lock it up, make it look good. Arquette comes down here and he thinks everything gon be all peachy and cream. Arquette, when he got here, he's all laughing and joking. Well, you don't see him laughing and joking now, he's sweating out there. He's waiting for a water break. He may not get a water break today, alright? This ain't the movies. We don't have stunt dummies, you do it yourself here. So when he's out there, he's learning, okay? He's learning. I don't know what he wants to get out of this. But he's learning, and he's learning the right way to do. So now he's got a good idea of what it's really like to be in there with the big boys. [David grunts] [soft music] It felt really good to train. Though I learned some of that stuff 18 years ago, I didn't have a training session quite like that, where it's really teaching you the fundamentals. What I love about wrestling is the majesty, like it's a larger than life. It's this mythological world, where there's the good guys and the bad guys. They're like gods. It's funny, I've been watching a lot of like old matches. And it's all like coming back to me, like why I fell in love with it. It occurred to me like when I was watching Macho Man, that I was in love with Miss Elizabeth. Like she literally, she looks like my wife too. She looks like Christina. God bless you girl CROWD: Are you kidding me right now? What are your feelings about possibly me doing it again? I don't like this. You don't like this idea. Why? What are your thoughts Charlie? Should I wrestle again? Yeah. That's my boy. How does Christina feel about this? She's on the fence for sure. He's afraid of growing old. I've loved wrestling my whole life. I was looking online, and I'm pretty sure I found myself ringside under The Giant match. David, on top of the fact that it's like really bad timing. You haven't asked me? You have to like ask me, right? I know, I'm sort of asking you right now, aren't I? But that's a little unfair. We can talk about it. It sounds like a dream, it sounds like a dream, like you're dreaming, it's not a reality. I don't know why I have to do it, and I got to do it. It's just something I gotta do. You don't know how these guys treat me. [soft music] How are you doing buddy. Not bad. I just started wrestling again, and people are still giving me crap. It's alright buddy, don't take it personally. Easy for you to say. Why do you think they hate me so much? Because you never deserved to be the champion. COMMENTATOR: Did David Arquette just, David Arquette won the world title. Yeah, why don't you mind your own business pal? Yeah, well then let's settle this in the ring. [bell rings] We're ready, tournament fighting background-- Get back. Must fight. Elbow, it's going up top. One, two, three. [crowd cheering] COMMENTATOR: Did David Arquette just, What's going on here? David Arquette won the world title. NARRATOR: Diamond Dallas Page tried to tell him it was a bad idea. But beyond that, like, what could we do about it? The last thing on the planet, David Arquette wanted to do, was become a Heavyweight World Champion, 'cause he actually respected this sport. And when they told me to finish that day, I laughed. I go and tell David, he's like, "No, no, dude, we can't do that." It's the biggest disgrace in professional wrestling history. But I couldn't do it because I have a booker that tells me what needs to be done. So let me ask you, if you were in his spot, and they said, we're gonna put the world title on you, we all know you wouldn't do it, right? [dialing tone] JERRY: Hello. Hello, Jerry. My BFF. My BFF. David has lost his mind yet again. He's going down to Mexico to train with the wrestler Diamond Dallas page. [Jerry laughs] I would feel better knowing that you were there. David and Jerry met five years ago with the Super Bowl. Jerry was wearing first responders Sandy Hook t-shirt. And David went up to him and said, "Do you have a ticket?" And Jerry said, "No." And he said, "Do you wanna go with me?" And that's how they met. And they became best friends. Can you leave tomorrow for Mexico? JERRY: 99% chance yes, I just gotta get the permission from my boss at the cop shop. Okay. I don't see it being a problem. Adios amigos. [upbeat music] Have you walked around? No, I just got here man. Alright. Look at that, look at that. Come on. There's something in there. It's pretty solid, right? Do you know how to lock up? Don't do that. He's an actual cop. Get over here. That hurt. [drum beats] I need you to train me how to wrestle. Why? Why do you want to get back in the ring? Because it hurts, because it's been 18 years of people thinking I disrespected the belt, and disrespected wrestling, and I'd never meant to. I mean, I'm 46 years old. I love wrestling. I just really wanna try it one more time. I just need some guidance from you. If you're willing to walk the talk. I'll guide you dude. Thanks man. And get ready for the pitfalls, 'cause people are gonna shit all over it. I know. [Diamond laughs] [upbeat music] When you get out there, you'll remember all this. You can do it, little by little. That's what you're gonna learn. And when you don't know, when you're working out, ask, ask questions. You got this bro? Thanks bro . [upbeat music] DDP center. Are you ready to train? Yeah man. Okay, let's go. Lucha. Right there. I got you. You puke here, if you got to puke. Thanks. Alright, throw up right up in here. Wait shit, this leg up? Yeah. This leg here. Yes. Okay. Fuck, one more time, one time, sorry! I got you, I'll just jump up there. Just do it. I'll take care of you. Okay. [speaking in foreign language] Even when you're throwing, you just throw close one, and I'm ducking you. Come on, come on. [audience cheers] JERRY: There you go. [car hooting] [breaks screeching] [upbeat music] [siren blaring] This is street wrestling. [upbeat music] I'm not gonna do something out here, am I? Are you ready? Do I get wear a mask? [speaking in foreign language] Shit. [groaning] [ speaking in foreign language] Got me something? Thank you. No, no? I didn't get anything. Sorry, I didn't get any money. Sorry, I didn't get any money. [truck hoots] Are you ready? Yeah, I guess so. Okay, you gotta be ready. I'm ready, I'm ready. [upbeat music] [cars hooting] Get that fucking chicken David, get that fucking chicken. [chicken clucking] I got it. [upbeat music] [upbeat trumpet music] [speaking in foreign language] [audience cheering] Hey Dave, this is for life. You have earned this. Really man? Yeah, you've earned it. Oh man, this is [mumbles] [David screaming] [upbeat music] [foreign language] [upbeat music] [spectators cheering] [spectators chanting] [speaking in foreign language] You guys can shoot me without my mask on now, so. [David laughing] Look at you, handsome guys. He needs a manager. Mr. Maldito gave me his mask bro. Really. Signed it, and gave me one. No. So fucking dope. That's unbelievable bro, that's an honor, right? [upbeat music] Fucking rattlesnakes, scorpions, fucking wrestling. [soft music] Thank you so much. [speaking in foreign language] [shouting] ALL: Lucha. [airplane engine roaring] [audience cheering] Hi, how are you? Yeah, welcome back. Good to see you Wendy, thank you. You look good. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. [audience cheering] I have a really big announcement to make, and I'd like to make it here on the "Wendy Williams Show". [audience cheering] WENDY: Alright, go ahead. I'd like to announce my return to professional wrestling. [grunting] [audience cheering] What is he doing? It's giving me major anxiety. And so, it's again his sternum area, and it's really sore. He says it feels like the same thing, that we called about in the past with the ribs and everything. I have to go to my doctor, just to make sure that I don't have any internal bleeding. DOCTOR: 'Cause we're really looking at his lungs, to see if he actually, we can do a rib x-ray to look at the ribs, or-- But I have to wrestle, so. I'll get just to know if I'm bleeding. NURSE: Did you have a car accident? A what? Car accident, or. No I'm a wrestler, and I had a wrestling injury. Mr. Arquette. Yeah, hi. Good, how are you? Obviously, we know you had several fractures in your ribs from the CAT scan report itself. Right. That were actually very small, but significant. If the ribs actually break, they can actually puncture your lung which is what gets even more concerning. If you actually puncture a lung, or actually bleed into your lungs. So-- But I'm cleared to fight? [David laughs] [upbeat music] It gives, it's not like hitting concrete, because it does give. We own this? Yeah, you own this. [upbeat music] [grunting] This is the right way. [upbeat music] [grunting] But he's always loved wrestling. He did this a long time ago. What is it, is it circus? What is it? Showing your strength? What is it? The wrestling thing, I still don't understand it, really. He's passionate about it, so you just send good vibes, and know that he's gonna be okay. [upbeat music] If you're just joining us, I'm calling out David Arquette. I don't know what your deal is. You think you're better than me. You think you're a better wrestler? You played Dr. Tucker, in "Muppets from Space". I think you overacted, and you brought down the film. Why are you calling me out bro? I didn't do anything. I elevated the muppet movie. We got David Arquette, he was at the "350 Days" premiere. And all of a sudden he's just like posing pictures, and RJ City comes up, starts like pushing him, and then they get into a little scuffle on the red carpet. PRESENTER: I'm confused. [groaning] It's nice and warm. [shrieking] Here we go. Talula is duct for wrestlers in the cupboard? TALULA: Yeah, the second shelf. Is there any body kind of like sheen you could put on? Oh, don't worry about that. Okay, I think my favorite scene is, probably everyone's favorite scene. But when you're with Rose McGowan, just that whole scene, how you say you took Spanish a bunch of time. Or like when she takes her shirt off, for an object. For an object. I feel like I'm melting. I am melting. [laughs] How are you guys? Who is that person? No it's so scary. Come here baby. It's a ridiculous world I'm in right now. What are you going to do when you go to your movie, and you show up like that? Oh shit, I forgot about that. [upbeat music] The wrestling world remembers him for being the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, that he won 18 years ago. And making his entering return, here at Championship-- It's sport, no matter what anyone says. But it's just a theatrical sport. It's like a play on steroids. When wrestlers win titles, it's like if you are in a play, and you were the king, and you were so proud, and you thought it was so real that you took the crown home and wore it, what are you doing? This is a show. Let's all calm down United States, let's relax. DIRECTOR: So yeah, I think so you drop your robe, streamers on the steps, drop the robe. Throw them out to the sides of the-- DIRECTOR: Yeah, half will go to the people, half will go towards the entrance. That will look cool. Is it good at the people, or not? Yeah, absolutely. Okay, good. And then from there, you take them off, and you get on the pedestal, right? And I put my hand down here, and when my head, when I strike the Michelangelo's pose, I come down on through. One, two, three. I fucking cross check him off, he goes rolling right out. [commentator mumbling] [audience cheering] I don't know what just happened, I'm lost. You whipped me with a belt. What is he doing? This is fucking horrible. He goes to get up those steps, I whip him again. I say ring the bell, ring the bell. And I go, I charge and sweep you, and I started pounding on you. You push me off, we do a slip slam. [crowd cheering] I pick it up, I celebrate, turn around and you poke me in the eye. I can't see, you scrape my back. I turn around, you started beating the shit out of me. And I stumbled toward the middle of the ring, and you double x headed me. And you get me, and whip me in the corner, when you're done, you slap me. [audience boos] That kind of wakes me up. Whoa, wait a sec. What the fuck is going on? COMMENTATOR: He's fired up, he spins me around, slaps me back. That slap is a big like-- Yeah, you mother. I turn him around, dirty back chop. And then he goes, gives me back elbow. Hits me in the gut. Hits me with another chop, and the big fore arm, "It's cool I'm doing it." And then you cut me off with the knee. You put me up in a Piledriver. Rip his head off. I wiggle out, and I-- Just kick my head off, right under my chin. I've got my hand, I'm saying, I got my hand up. Just aim, and like-- Yeah, I get an idea, the corner. AUDIENCE: David, David, David, David. I go for my crown, and I jump down. That's gonna be really, really good. Boom, one, two, three. [bell rings] [upbeat music] Here is your winner, RJ City. COMMENTATOR: RJ City, upsetting the big return. [audience boos] Okay, we're gonna get you some ice for that, dude. Nice. That was dope. Thank you. Thanks bro, and thank you for all your help. Wrestling is not fake guys, wrestling is not fake. That was fucking, look at me, come here. That was amazing. Hi guys, I know. His back is just like. I know that's bad. Oh my God, should we get you the-- Did you like the show though? Did you like the whole thing? The show was amazing, but we were just worried about you. Can I get five pictures with you, that's all I want if that's okay? Got a house full of people chanting your name. I know. It begs the question, are we gonna see you back in Championship Wrestling from Hollywood? I'll be back, I just don't know if I'll be in the ring. Thank you bro. Put some pressure on it. I know. You gotta squeeze it out of there. As the match progressed, he got more comfortable, and more confident in what he was doing. But the more repetitions he gets, the easier that's gonna be, where he could just be confident the whole time, and come out with that stage presence, and just own the moment. [dog barking] Last night mom was the most insane thing in the whole world. But like, it's very entertaining. I'm like, a lot less embarrassed than I was before. It was kind of fun. Oh, he's a wizard. No, he's not a wizard. What's wrong with you? I don't like any of this. Look at dad, look at him killing it. Oh God, I think it's just bad for any one of your bones in your body. No, I like it. What happens if you break your neck or something? I don't know, yeah. One of my favorites moments was Coco flipping them off. She was so upset. It's very real, it's very painful. It's realer than I ever knew. It's so hard. I can't believe these guys do this all the time. And like travel all the time. When I went out there, I'm not David the Hollywood fuck up that some people think I am. [upbeat music] David, your brother, Arquette is now wrestling. He had a heart attack, and now he's wrestling. When did he have a heart attack? I didn't know that. Yeah, he did. How long ago? A year ago, year and a half ago. I did not know that. Yeah. Wow, does it make you nervous to watch him? Yeah, it really scares me. So I actually don't watch the matches. Because it would terrify me too much. [soft music] Really, I'm just like blown away by everything. He's lost 50 pounds, he's quit smoking, drinking. He looks like a superhero. So there's like an element of it that I'm like, this is great, he's getting healthy, and taking good care of himself. But then you put in the layer of like you're getting beat up and thrown around in the wrestling ring by a bunch of wrestlers, which is not safe. I didn't expect him to work this hard to be honest. I thought this was just gonna be like, "Oh yeah, I'll go to the gym, "and then bounce off around in the ring." And he's like really a wrestler. David has a lot of buzz around him right now. So it's kind of cool, like the wrestling world's opening up their arms to David, and wanting him to come to a lot of events. Indy fans are the diehard fans, they're the lifeblood of the wrestling business. And so to redeem, to get the respect of the Indie fans, I mean, that's a true redemption right there. My whole life kind of revolves around wrestling sometimes. I'm here in Chicago, coming to watch the greatest wrestler, David Arquette, team up with RJ city. I can't believe I'm here. [upbeat music] AUDIENCE: Let's go David, yeah. [crowd cheering] Thank you man. [upbeat music] COMMENTATOR: He spit up right at David Arquette. Putting on great athletic competition, David Arquette. Yeah, do you want me to pick the right size? ♪ Happy Birthday to-- ♪ Where is that nice hat I gave you? That hat is in the dumpster, with all your DVDs. COMMENTATOR: Right through the heart of Arquette. [upbeat music] I'll shoot you. [audience cheering] COMMENTATOR: Turning him over, Arquette. It's not so bad. He is 46 years old, he is so impressive. COMMENTATOR: Arquette-- That's impressive. That was amazing. [upbeat music] You never know what's gonna happen at these kind of shows, with the crowd. They can be very unpredictable. I mean, they could have booed David out of the building. This is for real, and he's really doing it, and I think that's the buzz I'm hearing. Put it in. Squeeze it in. Does it look all right? [laughs] Let me put-- 'Cause I'm a wrestler, but I'm also bad crafty. [David laughs] I don't know if these glasses are a good idea NARRATOR: What's gonna happen to Arquette out there? Death man, and destruction. [crowd chanting] Yeah, the kid's fucked up, it's pretty bad dude. Everybody looks clean as fuck. [upbeat music] He's gonna fucking die, Nick fucking Gage all day. Nick fucking Gage. How about that? AUDIENCE: Come on Nick. Let's get ready to rumble. [glass shutters] What was that? That was a glass bottle. Oh geez. [glass shuttering] [audience cheering] Holy shit. [audience chants] One, two, three. [bell rings] [car horn] REPORTER: David Arquette hospitalized after a wrestling match, deathmatch. Shocking. What you're about to see what David Arquette. REPORTER: The graphic video-- I think David Arquette started to freak out. I don't think that David Arquette need to go back to the film industry. REPORTER: Well I'm sitting here watching these two dumb, stupid motherfuckers, obviously these people are fully trained from using fucking gimmicks that won't work with them. Well to put your body in the line, to that extent. It's a steep price to pay. One of the scariest things I've ever seen in all my years as a wrestling fan. We almost saw a man die in the middle of the ring. REPORTER: Did you hear the shit Joe Rogan was talking. David Arquette is wrestling? Yeah. Did you know this? Oh, Jesus Christ, that guy stabbed him in the fucking head. He just got sober a few years ago, and he's doing this to keep life exciting for him. You know what I mean? And I just-- Is that why he's doing it, or he just doesn't have any movie roles coming in? [television mumbling] [David murmurs] [thunder roars] [dogs barking] [upbeat music] The idea of sort of getting back into wrestling to a physician, or mental health clinician that's a red flag, right? Because pain it's a trigger for a relapse. He hasn't been training. There was such a high hopes that something like wrestling would be used in a way to really get healthy. And it's like what the fuck is going on? Like, what is the point of all of this? It's so strange that right after that deathmatch, David's life, just kind of became unglued. One of his dear friends, Luke Perry, passed away suddenly. And the irony is that, at that deathmatch, Luke was the one taking him to the hospital, and in the car with him. He is a fucking mess. Two years ago, it's a heart attack. A year later, it's a deathmatch. So what does that mean for next year? Is he gonna be here next year? I'm just like, worried he's gonna die. It's really the big issue here, is that he's gonna die, and our marriage does not survive. I'm a mess, bro. I'm a fucking mess. I've been a mess my whole life, and I'll probably be a mess the rest of my life, even if I was stone cold sober. I'm just a piece of work. Christina is away producing her first film, and I'm here just watching Miss Elizabeth. So it's kind of tough. So the crazy thing is, I have this one match with Mr. Anderson. And it's at the Legends of Wrestling, the same event that I was kicked out of last year. So I'm excited to be invited. Mr. Anderson just thinks I'm a bit of a joke, and isn't taking me seriously. So it's one last time I have to really prove myself, and show someone that I got what it takes, I'm not scared of him. I'm not scared of anyone. [crow cawing] I do understand why people got upset. But I've always wanted to jump into the ring. Being part of a world that I've always loved and respected. COMMENTATOR: David Arquette is in the ring. These people are heroes of mine. The match where I wrestled Jeff Jarrett and DDP. That was one of the greatest days of my life. I like to think that good people will always come out on top in the end.

COMMENTATOR: Right fans, here we are, one of the biggest events of the year, Legends of Wrestling, at the Fraser Hockeyland Arena, 10,000 fans in attendance, to see this main event, as Ken Anderson takes on David Arquette. It's great to be back here. I remember last year, met David right out here, right on the parking lot. But he just seemed out of it. I don't know if he was drunk, but he was just, I don't know. And I know he's gotten into good shape, not like this. But David Arquette is the real thing. And he's my buddy. [crowd cheering] You suck. You shut up. David Arquette as a wrestler, sucks. David Arquette should never hold a title again, ever. [David and Christina laughs] One, two, three. [crowd cheering] [upbeat music] [crowd cheering] COMMENTATOR: And here comes David Arquette, entering into the arena, full of thousands screaming fans, for this main event against Mr. Ken Anderson. David Arquette accompanied to the ring by the lovely Ms. Christina.

Okay, now we're coming up, come on. [upbeat music] David Arquette with a drop launch. [audience cheers] One, two, three. COMMENTATOR: The fans are on their feet, showing respect for David Arquette, and so is Booker T, the Hall of Famer, Booker T, raising the hand of David Arquette. [upbeat music] The respect of the fans here tonight. David. [crowd chanting] [upbeat music] This forever to me will be a special night. My dad had grew up loving wrestling, and he was super into it. He was always very supportive. He'd come to all the shows, so it was awesome for me to be able to share this with David. And I almost cried there at the end, and I think I did a little bit. But I wasn't really expecting that, but he's family. Your an incredible partner, and you're going to great places. I love the fact that you, and [mumbles]. [crowd cheering] Thank you [mumbles], but I've got something for you baby. [upbeat music] [siren wailing] David Arquette, fuck it, I can't lift it. [laughing] Anyone could be a champion. Shut up. [upbeat music] Yes. Look who's back y'all. Good [mumbles], happy birthday. [laughs] I wanted to something for you for your birthday. Yeah brother, Hulk Hogan here Mr. David Arquette, you brag about being a WC. In all seriousness David, happy birthday. [upbeat music] You walk out and fans are like touching you, touch your hand, and that's the coolest, it's that connection. Where like, when you get hit or something, you turn to the fan like this guy's gonna kill me. You make like a direct connection with a fan in the moment. Fuck you David Arquette. Fuck you Sandy. [upbeat music] It's not like it's real. The real reason I know David Arquette, is because his WCW title reign, and all the money that he made from that, literally all of it, he donated it to my family, because of my father's passing, he also donated Owen's family. So in my book, David Arquette is family, more than friend, he's a he's a member of my family, and I love him. Come here Lola and Lady. Ready. [dogs barking] I don't know how to come up a rope.
