Paulie, eat dirt or get punched in the stomach? How about I do neither Tony? Eat. Go on. When I was 9 years old, I elected to forgo friendships and instead dedicate my life to becoming one of the greatest thinkers of the 21st century, a scientist worthy of acceptance to the Shikenjanski Lab for Artificial Intelligence. Even as a child, I knew that if I worked tirelessly, I was capable of developing the type of ground-breaking technology you are about to see today. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a Shikenjanski Bot named after Professor Chuck Shikenjanski. I'll just show you. Most AI is set up to follow simple commands. Janski, spin around. But my technology only obeys commands that are in its best interest. Janski, drive forward 3 feet. It only drove like a foot Because jumping off the desk wouldn't be in the bot's best interest. Did I say you could come in here? What if jumping off the desk was really fun? Wouldn't that be in the bot's best interest? This is why I'm going to college a year early. Nobody here understands what it takes to become an important person. You don't know how to be a person, period. Your mom has your letter, by the way. What letter? From Professor Shiken-whatever. What? It feels thick. It's a good sign, right? What does it say, Paulie? Computer Science Department, this is Cathy. There's been a mistake on an application decision, I need Professor Shikenjanski's cellphone number. I'm sorry, we don't give out phone numbers for faculty. Computer Science Department, this is Cathy. What is Chuck Shikenjanski's home address? I'm not at liberty to share that information. Why don't you just email Shikenjanski's office? I did. They were even less helpful than you. No, I didn't mean it like that. Don't hang up, please. I need to connect with Professor Shikenjanski. It's a matter of life and... Shikenjanski's contact information is private. Please. This means everything to me. Look, all I can tell you is that he has a P.O. box in northern Minnesota. Morning, boys. Can I get you something? Apple fritter and a cup of coffee? Sorry, kid got the last fritter. He's been staring at those mailboxes for hours. Why? Don't know. I didn't want to bother him. Hey, kid, what you doing? Waiting. For what? You got a date? Is that why you're so dressed up? I'm waiting for a colleague. You probably don't know him. What's his name? Professor Chuck Shikenjanski. Oh, he's handsome. Gee, how do I know that guy? Because we met him 10 minutes ago at the bait shop. What? He was wearing a turtleneck. Yeah, right. Yeah. Your shirt was this guy? Where's the bait shop? The other end of downtown. All you have to do is... oh. Yeah, he just got here. He's moving pretty good. Oh! Oh, what the hell? Uh, what is this? It's a leech. This man, where is he? Yeah, he's right here yelling at me. He's got a big, fat leech on his neck. This man, where did he go? Please. You gonna pick that up? Okay, yeah, I'll tell him. Uh, Betty says your friend is getting something from one of the P.O. boxes up the street. Son, I'm gonna need you to come with me. I have to go right now. My life is on the line. Well, you're not going anywhere in this stolen van. If I don't find Professor Shikenjanski, there will be profound ramifications on the future of American innovation. We could easily wake up 10 years from now to find that Sweden has supplanted the U.S. as the global superpower in autonomous robotics. Do you really want that on your conscience? Okay, kid, you can come in now? Sir, if I don't find Professor Shikenjanski in the next... Yeah, I know, I know. My door was open. Sit down. You know, you could have made both of our lives a lot easier by telling me you took your uncle's van without asking. He never drives it. He just leaves it in a parking lot and calls it, "advertising". Don't tell me. Tell him. And it's a lot easier to fly here from California than it is to drive. It's probably cheaper, too, just so you know. Hello. Mr. Go, hi. This is Sheriff Anderson from Hubbard County, Minnesota. We spoke earlier. Is Paulie with you now? Paulie is right here next to me. Yes. Paulie? Yes. I'm sorry. You're in big trouble, Paulie. Mr. Go, am I correct to assume that you will not be pressing charges against your nephew? No. No charges. Okay, great. His father died when he was young. He doesn't know how to be a man. I'm sorry to hear that. He's very smart, but he's always been small for his age and he has no friends at school. Well, I guess that's case closed. You know, I actually deal with a fair amount of inter family auto theft, although usually it's after a divorce. Yeah. Hey, Sheriff. Brandon, uh, could you bring back the van from this morning? The van with the Chinese riding? It's Filipino, but yes, that one. Jason. We gotta bring the Chinese van back to town. I just unhooked it. So hook it back up. Brandan, what's going on over there? Uh-huh. The bumper. Yeah, well, just... Keep me posted, okay? You ever tried Walleye, Paulie? That is a 40-pound muskie. It looks like the statue in town. Close. The one in town is a tiger muskie. Did you catch this one? I caught it. With a leech. It's true. We were fishing a few bays away, which is wild in itself, because we're not even on a muskie lake, and Avery had this crummy second-hand rod. Oh, uh, Avery, Polly. Polly, Avery. We ran into each other earlier. Oh, great. So anyway, when that fish hit Avery's line, I had no idea how big it was, because she wouldn't hand me the rod. She wanted to do the whole thing herself. 8 years old. You must have fought that thing for what, 20 minutes? 35. Well, long enough, that one of her hands started bleeding. It's not every day my dad brings home a hungry criminal for dinner. We Just had a little miscommunication down at the station. I told Paulie he could crash up in the loft and uh, pick up his van in the morning and head on back to California. No more manhunt? It's not a manhunt. I just need to connect with a colleague who lives off the grid. You already work with the professor? Not yet. Paulie's graduating from high school a year early. Yeah, Avery's going to Duluth in the fall. Why don't you just wait till you're on campus to introduce yourself to the professor? How much do you know about the progress of deep learning algorithms and humanoid robots? As much as you know about table manners. Hey. Sorry. So you got into school a year early. I would have, if the admissions people knew anything about artificial intelligence. You got rejected? I could reposition European space satellites if I wanted to. You know, Avery actually knows quite a bit about technology herself. Dad. What? You do. She makes videos on the internet. Videos? Yeah. Fishing videos, ton of people watch 'em. Why? Dad, put it away. I'll just show him one. Whatever. Look at this. Okay, guys, nearly got him. I'm pretty sure it's a Walleye. Notice how I didn't just start pumping my rod when I felt him strike. Unlike northerns, Walleye don't slash at bait, they inhale it. So if you pull back too quick, you could pull the bait clean out of the fish's mouth. She really is a great angler. I mean, that video has like 5,000 views. She's not usually rude like that. Her boyfriend just broke up with her, and... And he's a total burnout, but they spent a lot of time together. She doesn't have a lot of close friends, you know? She's more like independent, self-sufficient. And scary. Hmm? What's happening on Spider Lake? Nothing. You can't just spy on people. 'Cause that's your thing. What do you want? Why would an artificial intelligence professor hide out in northern Minnesota? He doesn't wanna be found. How did you find him? I built an algorithm to bypass the firewalls in the school's human resource department, so another bot could process the information related to Professor Shikenjanski's whereabouts. That can't be legal. Please leave me alone. I'm just giving you shit. Come outside. No. You coming? You need my help. What do you mean? Which Spider Lake is he on? Minnesota has over 10,000 lakes, common names like Big Lake, Bass Lake or Spider Lake are used multiple times. How many? 2.10. Let's say you do pick the right lake. How are you gonna find this guy's place? You can't see anything from the road. Do you have a boat? Are you gonna kill him? This isn't a joke to me. It's the only thing I care about. If Professor Shikenjanski doesn't get me into his lab, my life won't matter. Okay, I get it. No, you don't. Evan Ehrenberg was a PhD candidate by 16. Rifath Sharook was already designing satellites. You probably have no idea who either of those people are. And I don't care. But the hacking thing you did, could you do it to YouTube or Instagram? Could you make it to where certain videos are featured more frequently than they normally would be? Certain fishing videos? Could you manipulate the code or whatever to make sure my videos pop up more frequently? Obviously. Then I'll make you a deal. I'll take you around the lake, so you can stalk your professor if you promise to boost my videos. But if you suddenly jump from 5,000 views... I have a lot more than 5,000 views. The video your dad showed me... Is super old and isn't even on my main channel. Are you in or not? Some of these lakes have over 50 miles of shoreline. They have hidden bays, and islands, and unmarked streams. Without my boat, you'll never... Fine. I'll do it. Great. Woah! It's for the leeches. Here's how this is gonna go. My dad thinks I'm camping with my friends this weekend, so I'll be out of the house by the time you wake up. When you get in the car, he'll tell you his "I saw Prince jam with Janet Jackson in 1996" story. It's super long and he won't have time to ask you any questions. When you pick up your kidnapper van, Brandon will probably tell you about the one time he took me fishing. Right? I'm bringing it back. I'm bringing it back. Ah, I caught it. Don't believe his version. I had to reel in his fish after he dropped his cellphone in the water and started crying. Drive 35 miles to Motley. There's a store there called, "Moe's". Buy yourself a couple outfits, so you can blend in. Leave your van in the parking lot and I'll pick you up. We'll start with the closest Spider Lake and work our way out from there. Look at you, townie! Let's get going. There are three properties that would fit the needs of Professor Shikenjanski. No close neighbors, a building big enough for a robotics lab, and a clearing large enough to land a helicopter. Why would he need to land a helicopter? Because some of his equipment is... It'll take too much time to explain. There. That's it. Where? I don't see anything. That's the point. The satellite photos show a clearing and a large structure up over that hill. Let's go. Grab it. Stay here. Watch out for booby traps. Hello. It's not him. What was that girlish shriek, I heard? I don't know. I heard it, too. Let's go. Go that way. What are you doing? It'll take too much time to explain. This is the wrong lot. Good morning. Nice day for a cruise. It's perfect. Hey, do you know who lives in that big cabin, couple lots down? It's for sale. She always drive? I do other things. It's why I keep him around. Have you ever seen this guy? No, I'd remember that guy. What about that lot out on that point? Couple bought it last year. They're Unitarians. What does that mean? It means they hug too much in church. Does anyone around here drive a red Chevy Volt? Not on purpose? Okay. Thanks for your help. No problem. Enjoy your youth while you got it, kids, getting old sucks. Here's what I don't get. You're racing to go to college, but all the big tech guys dropped out. You can't drop out of college if you don't go to college. I'm not going to college. You're not? I thought... You don't learn anything important in college. My dad doesn't know yet. I wouldn't care about college at all if it weren't for Professor Shikenjanski. What's he do that's so cool? Do you really wanna know or are you just gonna make fun of me? I wanna know. Professor Shikenjanski is teaching robots to have relationships by signing quantitative value to emotional interaction. Why does he need you? Because I developed a compounding conclusion algorithm for intuition learning that could ultimately boost emotional capacity by at least 36 percent. So you're a relationship expert? Here we go. Is it big? Oh, yeah. In a sec, I'm gonna hand you the pole. No, why? So I could take off my shirt. What? First time I did a video in my bathing suit, I went from 100 to 100,000 views. They don't all get that much, but it's a lot more than the videos on my personal channel. Does your dad know? No, don't be stupid. Hold it steady, don't let up. All right, you guys, got one on the line. This could be our muskie. Fish of 10,000 casts. Oh God, where is it? Oh, I... I see some color. Damn it. It's a tiger. See, a lot of people would be really excited about this catch, but here's the problem. Tiger muskies aren't real fish. They were created in a lab by crossbreeding northerns and muskies to make it easier for lazy fishermen to catch the big one. Earn your trophies, people! I'm not about to let this cyborg into my boat. Go ahead. Till next time. Do you have a girlfriend, Paulie? You ever had a girlfriend, ever kissed a girl? I have more important things to do. In fact, we... We shouldn't be wasting time. We need to keep searching. These bugs are ferocious. Dude, they're just mosquitoes. You Avery? Yep. Spoke about an hour ago. What's his deal? Not a lot of social skills. Thank you. Have a good one. I have social skills. Why'd you say I don't have any social skills? Outside. I was just joking. You don't have social skills, either, you know? Sure, Paulie, I have 60,000 followers and I don't have... Who like watching you catch fish in your bathing suit. At least, I'm teaching my audience a skill I actually possess. I'm gonna be one of the greatest scientists of the 21st century. How can you teach robots to have meaningful relationships when you don't have any friends? You don't have any friends either. I have a lot of friends. Then how come none of them texted you today or yesterday? What have you been like looking at my phone or something? Yes. Professor definitely doesn't live here. I almost kissed a girl once. Yeah. I'm pretty sure she wanted me to do it. Who was she? It... where were you? It was at math camp. Of course, you went to math camp. You know what? Uh, sorry, I... I wanna hear this story. So it was a girl at math camp. Last summer, we were the last two people to leave the bonfire on pie night. What, like you cooked pies in the fire? Pie, like the number. Everyone stays up all night, 'cause, you know, pie never ends. Okay, so you and this girl are the last two to leave the pie night bonfire, and she's pretty cute. Yeah. And really smart. I hope you told her that. I didn't. Where was she sitting? Right next to me. She put her head on my shoulder. Oh God. She wanted you to do it. That's what I thought. So what did you do? I asked her if she could take her head off my shoulder. Why? Because the angle for the kiss wouldn't work if her head was there. Oh God, Paulie. What? Nothing. What happened next? We just sort of stared at each other for a while. Why didn't you make a move? I thought about it, but ultimately, how much do you know about the Markov decision process? Hold on, I... No, she wanted you to kiss her and you were doing maths problems. I was just approximating initial state probabilities. And then she left? She ran away, crying before I could do anything. What was I supposed to do? Take a chance. Follow your heart. Please tell me you went after her. No, I went back to my cabin and... Went back to your cabin and what? Hand me the binoculars. I think I see a red Chevy Volt. It just disappeared behind those trees. What if he's not here? Then we'll look again tomorrow. We are 100 miles from the P.O. boxes where I first saw him. What if Spider Lake was just a decoy? What if it wasn't? This was a mistake. I'm so stupid. You know what's crazy, those baby loons were born this spring and in a couple of months they'll down to the Gulf of Mexico all by themselves. What about the parents? The parents teach them everything they know and then take off. So the kids just figure it out as they go? They just figure it out. Where's your mom? I don't know. My dad died when I was little. Sorry. He would have been a really important scientist if he hadn't. He was awesome. Yeah, my mom wasn't. Where did they just go? Yeah, that was weird, right? It can't be private. All Minnesota waterways are public. Let's go. What the hell? Damn it! It's a sand bar. Good evening, Paulie Go. It's him. How does he know your name? Beautiful night, isn't it? Say something. Professor Shikenjanski? Call me "Chuck". Okay. Chuck, okay. How do we get over there, Chuck? How did you find this place? I hacked the university's human resource department. Outstanding. Thanks. Maybe you should tell them about all your other crimes. What can I do for you, Paulie? I developed a compounding conclusion algorithm for intuition learning that could ultimately boost emotional capacity by at least 36 percent. Simulated or realised? Realised, obviously. Outstanding. I can save you at least six months of development on conclusion conversions alone. What do you want? Let him in your lab. Well, that's not something I do. I'm sorry. Just review my work. Please, you'll see what I'm capable of, but we would be capable if you... I'll consider it. Is that it? We should go. Paulie. Dude, that guy was super weird. Genius is often misunderstood. Maybe. But he could also be hiding local schoolchildren in his basement. What's with all the security? We're not the only ones looking for him. Who else? The government, the Swedes, business leaders, anyone who cares about technological innovation. But why can't they just meet with him on campus? Because Professor Shikenjanski is never on campus. He lectures remotely. Seriously? That way, he doesn't have to waste time with people when he could be doing research. Or he's actually a super villain? He should have asked more questions. And invited you. Exactly. I mean, no, he just... I could help him change the world. I would make him proud. I would. He said he'd consider your work. He didn't mean it. No. No way. Paulie, now is not the time to be sad. You just executed a successful cross-country manhunt. That's amazing. And we need to celebrate. Tadaa! Mini golf? I work here part time. What color ball do you want? I don't really feel like playing right now. Got you something for that. Take a sip. Tastes like cinnamon gasoline. I think that's their slogan. You want some? I'm driving. Right. You're up. Cut it out. Stop thinking about the professor. If he doesn't realise how brilliant you are, than he's stupid. But he's the smartest... Enough! You don't wanna play golf. Fine. Then let's dance. Come on. No one's here. Let me see some moves. Let go, Paulie. Just have fun. Yeah. Oh, I love this one. I'm at the edge of the sunset I'm looking in on my wall Indecisions, I can hear my inhibition Sorry, dude, we're just buddies. Thank you for picking me though. It means a lot. Are you okay? Okey-do key, Miss Anderson, your condition is not normally a cause for concern in the early stages of pregnancy. 10 weeks? 8, I think. Come in. I found a dashing young father-to-be wandering the halls. Jesus. What? Oh my God, I am so sorry. I thought... oh my God. What's going on? Are we done? Maybe limited vaginal bleeding or spotting is not a major deal, but if the bleeding gets heavier, it could foreshadow an ectopic pregnancy or a miscarriage in the second trimester. Heavy... Could signal placental abruption. So what are you gonna do about your videos? What do you mean? Are you still gonna make fishing videos when you get... Yeah. I'll probably do 'em topless, so people don't pay attention to the fact that I'm... Really? No. What kind of question is that? I don't know, sorry. Is the dad the guy who dumped you? How do you know about that? I... Of course, you know about that. What did you do, look through my phone again? Your dad told me. Told you what? That Clint's a pothead who dumped me after I had a nervous breakdown. He told me the pothead part. Why did you have a nervous breakdown? Because I messed up! And I'm turning into my mom. She was pregnant at 18, too. My dad thought he was gonna be an air force pilot or a rock star. But he got to have you. Paulie, you may be a genius, but you don't know shit. At least, you don't really need to be concerned about an ectopic pregnancy or placental abruption. That doctor was so weird, it's like he couldn't shut up. It was like he malfunctioned. His patterns were actually kind of robotic, the way he held onto words was like an auto-engager. What's an auto-engager? It's um, a reoccurring tic or gesture that's meant to endear the bot to actual humans, but it's said that bots often deploy in obvious gestures like winking or whistling. Or repeating the same generic response over and over again. Holy shit. Outstanding! No, it can't be. Shikenjanski would have to be so far ahead of the rest of the world... Right? And he wouldn't wanna keep that a secret. Actually, he would. The public is worried that robots are going to overthrow human civilisation, so every major advancement is met with waves of regulatory and ethical challenges. That sounds smart. It's insane. This whole conversation is insane. You wanna go back? Supposed to be a road coming. I don't see anything. Stop! There. Uh, Professor, this is Paulie Go. We spoke earlier in the lake. On the lake. Look, we know your secret. Why would you say that? I don't get it. There's no space for a lab. Plenty of space to stash bodies, though The bodies aren't the problem, it's all the equipment and servers. We're talking about different things. What are you doing here? Uh, I'm... I'm sorry, ma'am. There's been a mistake. We're in the wrong place. Who knows you're here? Where is the professor? The professor is a very private person. And doesn't appreciate people sneaking on his property. We called from the gate. But you didn't have an appointment, did you? Do you work for the professor? Look, if you leave before the professor gets back, I won't... Too late. Paulie Go and friends. Shit! Great to see you again. Chuck, disengage and get back in the house. Outstanding. Woah. What the... You're the professor. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to do that, I didn't mean to do that. I hate guns. I just... Please just... just come inside, just come inside. I'm sorry. You coming? I don't host visitors, so I'm afraid I don't really have any snacks. You've got all the Santa fish. Yeah, Maltby's Department Store used to sell a new one of these every Christmas. Until they closed in 2012. So you grew up here. I grew up in the cities. But your bio says you grew up in New York. That's Chuck's bio. Oh my God. You've got the muskie. Please be careful with that one, it's very rare. Oh, s... sorry. When I was little, I wanted the Santa muskie so bad. But my parents could only find the tiger muskie on eBay. Ugh, I hate tiger muskies. Right? I... I really should have them in a case. But Chuck likes them out, so. Chuck likes things? Of course. So why did you come here? Because I developed a compounding conclusion algorithm for intuition learning that could ultimately... Yeah, yeah, 36 percent, I know, you said that last night. You were there? No, she patched into Chuck's audio interceptors. That's right. Don't you have fully-integrated comm override? Yes, but not remotely. Chuck was fully autonomous on the dock. His auto-engager... I am... ...working on that, it's very tricky. I want to work with you. I don't work with other people. Me neither. What about her? She makes fishing videos. Why? Professor, in addition to my algorithm, I developed my own methodology for emotional evaluation regressions. Can you scale from individual to group dynamics? Obviously. Interesting. Why did you build a man? Uh, for your secret identity? Uh, computer science wasn't exactly friendly to people who looked like me. But it's better now, right? Where's the restroom? End of the hall. Don't touch anything. So how'd you pick the name, Chuck? Honestly... ...I named him after Chucky. Chucky. The doll that comes to life and kills people. Oh. I know, I know, it's... it's weird. But got a messed-up sense of humor. No. That's bad ass. Hey, Chuck. Oh, wait a second, so you got the job before... Ah, Chuck got the job. Right, Chuck got the job even though Chuck didn't exist yet. The university awarded Chuck several million dollars to build a remote lab. There in on it, right? I mean, they would have to be in on it. The only people who know the truth about Chuck are the president of the university, the head of the computer science department, and one very wealthy trustee. And us. I suppose. What are you gonna tell people? I mean, Chuck's amazing. Don't you want people to see your research? Your generation cares too much about credit. It's not about the credit. It's about the work. Exactly. But don't you want to inspire other people? The work is everything. Professor, Chuck's door was open, but I didn't see any servers or docking equipment. Where are all the processors? Are they running simulations while he charges? It's a good question. Let me show you. Are those brainwaves? In a way. When Chuck isn't interacting with me, he reprocesses his day. Like a dream? Reinforcement learning. Wow. How did you build this? I told local contractors it was a high-tech bomb shelter for the nuclear apocalypse. And they believed it? They didn't understand why some of the equipment had to be brought in by helicopter, but... I knew it. I mean, people are ridiculous. Beyond ridiculous. Can I get you anything? Water, oat milk, a piña colada? A piña colada? It's a frozen beverage, 3 ounces pineapple juice, 1 ounce white rum, 1 ounce co... I... I don't want a piña colada. No problem. Remind me of your name. Uh, my name is Beyoncé. Of course. Chuck? Yes, Beyoncé. What is the capital of Zimbabwe? Harare. How big was the largest freshwater bass ever caught? 22 pounds, 4 ounces. It was caught on Lake Montgomery in the state of Georgia by George Perry on June 2nd, 1932. Would you like to try Qigong, Beyoncé? Uh, sure. Outstanding. Do you feel present, Beyoncé? I feel different. Tell me about your work. Uh, I'm a ninja. Of course. Do you still keep in touch with your colleagues from grad school? I didn't go to grad school. Oh, people can be such bullies. What? People, they can be such bullies when they are jealous of your intellect and accomplishments. Is that what Professor Shikenjanski says? That's what Cheryl says. Cheryl. Who helped you with this? I wrote everything myself. Huh. There were very few mistakes in the architecture. What mistakes? Well, if this algorithm were to work, the emotional range you aspire to integrate is far too broad. Like Chuck's range is about 60 percent of the spectrum. 60 percent is a dog. You're wrong. What else do you and Cheryl do for fun? Cheryl loves canoeing. She also loves camping, a hot cup of tea, and snuggling. Do you snuggle with Cheryl? Whose Cheryl? Hey, Chuck. Who's this guy? Dr. Roman Green was the sweetest and strongest man who ever lived. He had a way of holding you that let you know you were safe. You sure look a lot like him. My nose isn't quite right and my laugh needs to be warmer. No. Boundary Waters Canoe... Chuck, go for a walk now! How dare you? You have no right to ask Chuck about my relationships. I'm sorry. You need to leave. Both of you need to leave. What did I do? You brought a snoop into my house. Uh, I wasn't snooping. It's obvious they look the same. Enough! What about my work? I don't care! Paulie, she's in love with her robot. Chuck is on his way to expressing a full range of human emotions, but without the pollution of human flaws. Bonding without jealousy, persuasion without bullying. He'll be perfect. He'll be a tiger muskie! Get out now! No, this isn't fair! Out! Professor, please! If I see or hear from either one of you again, I will call the FBI. Why couldn't you just keep your mouth shut? Paulie, she's delusional. She's seven full years ahead of the entire world. She's afraid of the entire world. No, she's afraid the world will slow her down and she's right. She's afraid that people like you will judge her, and label her, and prevent her from reaching her true potential. She is or you are? You don't get it. What don't I get? Greatness, ambition. You're hiding from your life in a fishing boat. At least, I've lived. At least, I don't spend my life working on robots, because I'm scared of human relationships. At least, I didn't get knocked up. Shit. Are you okay, Chuck? 391,000 people were injured last year in car accidents involving a distracted driver. Shut up! Either one of you open your mouths and I'm leaving you both in a ditch. Shit. What did you do? I didn't do anything. Maybe he just wants to pass us. Yeah. What's the speed limit? The speed limit is the maximum speed at which a car can legally drive in... Shut up! You two are in lot of trouble. Dad? You were lucky, I'm the one that found you first. Sir, are you okay? Outstanding. Okay. You two need to talk to me. Why would this woman say you kidnapped the professor if you didn't? Because she's nuts. Nope, that's not good enough. Every sheriff's department north of St. Cloud is looking for you. This is serious. Would you like to try Qigong? Uh, no. Wait, what? Is that doggie domesticated? One across the street? Hmm. Hardly, but professor, we... Where are you, doggie? What is his deal? Avery. Look, I... I can't help you unless I know everything. Alright, you need to tell me everything. Paulie. Paulie. Go ahead, Paulie. Tell him everything. I'm done being an accessory. An accessory to what? Avery's not going to college and she's pregnant. Is that true? Why wouldn't you tell me? Is that a joke? Honey. I didn't tell you, because I'm your daughter! Which means when I get scared, I go fishing and pretend my problems don't exist or I run away like mom. Avery. Come here, doggie. Chuck. Chuck, get out of the road. Is that doggie 33 percent terrier? I don't know. Come back right now, that's a direct command. Chuck! Oh my God, oh my God, it's not my fault. He just ran right out onto the road. What the heck? Ma'am, you need to tell me your brother's date of birth. I told you it's irrelevant. It's protocol. If we don't follow protocol, we can't do our jobs. Lady, we have a lot to do. So if you're not gonna be helpful, I... Nothing you were doing and nothing you have ever done is as important as finding my companion. You mean your brother? Just frickin' find him! Hey, where's Chuck? Step into my office. Where did you take him? He chose to get in the truck. You kidnapped him. Technically, it's theft. My office, now! Look. I need to get to the bottom of whatever's been going on for the last few days, which means that both of you... What did you tell him, Paulie? If you told him anything, I will end your career before it starts. Threats are not productive right now, professor. Productive. This young man kidnapped my... My... Brother. Exactly. That's what I said. He kidnapped my brother. You were wrong! You were totally wrong. You said that Chuck was ready to take on the real world, but he wasn't. It doesn't matter how smart he was, because he wasn't designed to live. He was designed to be flawless. I know, that's the problem. Enough. I've had it up to here with the yelling and the lies. No more lies. You said wasn't. He wasn't ready. What did you mean by wasn't? If anything happened to Chuck, Paulie, I will make sure that you are blackballed from every top university. I don't care. Then why did you come looking for me? Because I wanted you to like me! I don't have any friends at home, and I... I always thought it was, because the other kids weren't smart enough to be my friends. I thought if anyone would understand me, it would be you. You fit the equation in my head. I need to go find Avery. What are you doing? I know about the robot. I'm sorry, I don't... I don't know why you'd say something like that. I saw his parts all over the road. What? Not all of his parts. Look, uh... Mom, hi. Sorry. Sorry, I didn't call you back. Oh, I can't talk right now, 'cause I'm on a jet ski. A jet ski, yeah. Yeah, okay, I'll call you right back after I find my friend. I love you. Bye. Hey. Can I talk to you for a sec? Whose jet ski is that? I think it's your neighbor's. You stole it? I needed to find you. Why? I don't know. I mean... I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, I should never have told your dad that you got knocked up, impregnated. It's okay. He was gonna find out at some point. I just... I really want to be your friend. I've never had a friend like you before. Paulie. Come here. Okay. God, it's huge. Careful. Sorry. What should I do? Woah! Alright, Paulie, hold it steady. Oh, okay. I'll get the net. We did it! It's a real muskie, right? The fish of 10,000 casts. Oh yeah. What should we do now? You let it go. Shouldn't we take a picture first? No, we'll remember we caught it. Of course, we're gonna take a picture. People make their whole life for a fish like this. Oh my... How come Minnesota has so many lakes? Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox? Legend has it that Paul and Babe were so big, each of their footprints formed a new lake as they wrestled around the state. That's ridiculous. Yeah, but it's fun to think about when you're a kid. You know there are ways to make the actual science fun to think about, too. I'm sure there are. There's actually a Paul Bunyan theme park that's not too far from here. Could take you there before you drive back. Sure. If we survive this. Sit. I watched your videos. What? You're fishing videos. Your outburst about Chuck and the tiger muskies caught me off guard. And I was angry, so I didn't consider the merits of the argument until after. Which channel did you? I found them all. And now, I'm curious. Why do you make them? She's a great teacher. She really connects with her viewers. No, I don't. Those connections aren't real. My audience doesn't know me. It's all a bullshit substitute for actual relationships. I get it. Professor, I'm sorry about Chuck. I had no right to take him. Chuck? Did Paulie kidnap you? Paulie invited me to accompany him and Beyoncé in the truck, I chose to go. Where is he? Online. Come on. Our little episode has made me realise that I need to spend more time on campus. Isolation is limiting my scientific ceiling. Ultimately, I will let the world know who Chuck is and that he was invented by someone who looks like me. But not until I'm ready. This says that you promise not to expose my identity or share any aspects of my work without my permission. And in return, I will sponsor your admission to the university of your choosing. I assume this works for you, too? Woah, I... This is amazing. It's just something cheap, because I don't have any money yet. When I'm the most important scientist in the world, I'll have a lot more. Most important scientist in the world. Is that still the plan? Yeah. I'm just in less of a rush. See ya. See ya.
