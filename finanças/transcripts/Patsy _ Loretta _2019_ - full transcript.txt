It's a great song and Decca's behind it. It's gonna chart, I promise you. Long as you work for it. Like you always do. What's the schedule then? 'Course we can cut it back. Hand it over.

There's plenty other princesses, baby. Julie Dick, honey, what did I tell you? Maybe you should get your own coloring book. Mama's sorry, babe. You sure you don't want to cut it back? I want to add country radio to the front half of this schedule. Maybe TV too. That's what I want. Oops... Hey baby! Gonna break that damn door. Hey Charlie, how you doing? Elegant, thank you.

You know, a little sparkle on your outfits. Are you opposed to sparkle? Well, no sir. And we're gonna get you in some high heels, put on a little makeup. Nah, nope. Nah, nah, nah. No. Sparkle's fine but there ain't no way she's wearing makeup. Well, Doo, I mean... honey, you said it yourself, I mean, they're the professionals. Maybe we should listen to what they have to say. You ain't paintin' your face up to look like a prostitute. Ain't got nothin' to do with the reason why people like you. In fact, its the opposite. And people like you 'cause you seem like everybody else. Right. Well, she's got down home charm, but, you know we need folks in cheap seats to be able to see that pretty face.

Gonna get me my dream house after all. With a Caddi in the driveway. And a fox fur coat. - A whole closet of 'em. - I only need the one. And now ladies and gentleman, Miss Loretta Lynn.

It's actually Dick. You need something, buddy? Baby come here. This... This is Patsy Cline's husband. Charlie Dick. Mooney Lynn. Patsy heard you on the Jamboree and was hoping you'd come by and visit her tomorrow? What? Hey well she'll be there. Mh-hmm. You going to behave today?" Come on in. You got a vistor. Oh hey... you must be Loretta. Well come on now. How we gonna visit if you standing in the hall? Oh. Go ahead and shut the door if you don't mind. Those for me? Um. Oh. I don't even like roses. Toss those. Put 'em in the sink or something. Yours will look real pretty in that vase. Miss Cline, I hope you're not angry with me. Angry? Why? And call me Patsy. I wou... for singing your song. Not at all. I... I thought it was real sweet. I wanted to thank you for it. Doo told me I was being crazy. You think I invited you here to yell at you or something? Well I don't know. I don't always think before I do things. Doo says causes all sorts of problems. Well now I gotta know who Doo is. Oh, Doo's my husband. Well, uh... Mooney most people call him on account of he used to deliver moonshine back where he is from in Butcher Holler. But before that his daddy called him Doolittle. I think because he is such a little thing. Sure did grow though. Still, I just call him Doo. Well you sure got folks talking, sugar. Now your with the Wilburns I hear. Uh... well sorta. Doyle's been working with me on songwriting but... but I'm only here 'cause of Doo. How you figure? Well he's the one that wanted me to sing. You don't wanna sing? No, I like it. Just it don't make no sense anybody pay to see me is all. Ain't nothing special. So you just do whatever Doo tells you? You ain't got no drive of your own? I was real young when we met. And he'd already served in the army and traveled around, lived a lot of life. I was just, Loretta. Felt real special he even noticed me. How old were you? Fourteen. Well I don't mean to sound like I got regrets. I... I love him. He works hard. Takes good care of us. It's just, well it ain't easy, disagreeing with him. Shit sugar, disagreein' ain't ever easy. Doesn't mean it ain't necessary. Hey let's say Doo never happened. What do you want? I don't know I guess, I only ever thought about wanting to be a mama. Want my family to be taken care of. And I want everyone to know how much I love 'em. Alright well lets think about this a little more. Let's say all thats guaranteed. You ain't got to worry about nothing no more. What do you want? I guess I want the same thing for the world. There's so much heartache out there. I start to think about it, I just want to die. I guess I just want everyone to know their loved. Someone cares about them. I just don't want no one feeling alone when they go to sleep at night even if they are. Sounds like you was always gonna be a singer. The Wilburns offered me a management contract. Well hey that's great! Well it could be. Well listen if you're worried about the fact that they're musicians too, sure, there's plenty of stone cold dumdums in this business. But I tell you my Randy's a picker and hiring him is the best business decision I ever made. Oh lord, it's late. You alright, little gal? Sure, just, Doo's gonna be looking for his supper. Well alright now, give the Cline a shove inside. Alright, ready? MmmHmm Alright here we go. Oh, hey now. What are you looking for? Dinner, damnit! You been at the hospital this whole time? Patsy's real sweet. Thank I finally got a friend here. Did Charlie give you a ride home? She gave me money for a taxi. I don't like that. You taking a taxi by yourself. Well it seems like there's a lot you don't like. Oh yeah? You looked at that contract yet? From the Wilburns? Sure. Well? I wanna sign it. Not yet. Why? Loretta, you got a fifth grade education, what the hell you know about contracts? I'm frying liver tonight. Won't take long. See that it don't. Looks real fair to me. I'd ask 'em to make it two years, instead of three. But if I was you I would sign it. Can I tell Doo that? Well honey he's your husband. You can tell him whatever you want. Afternoon Miss Patsy. Hey there Gertie, you met Loretta? I have. I heard you on the Opry last week, you were great! Well thank you. Now what form of torture you bringing me today, girl? Ohh Miss Pasty. You make sure she eats this, Miss Loretta. I promise. I'm going to grab you some ice water. MmmHmm Dump that in the commode. Patsy, that's good food! Then you eat it. Charlie was supposed to smuggle me a cheeseburger but Julie got sick. Now come on, grab my wheelchair. You... Well, I ain't got a car and you can't drive so what are we doing? Rotiers is down the street relax. Miss Patsy, you sure wolfed that food fast. Oh I couldn't help myself. Courtyard's only open another twenty minutes. See you soon. Lord have mercy this is good. See it's going to be downhill the whole way back. How long you been with Charlie? Well that depends on when you start countin'. Been married a little over two years. Of course I had to divorce Gerald first. And your babies? Charlie's. Gerald didn't want any. Didn't want me singing neither. That don't make no sense. No, it did not. Hey, how'd you even start singing anyway? Singing long before Gerald. Fourteen I started. Your mama and daddy singers or something? My daddy had a real fine voice. Still does for all I know. Didn't do it professional though. I guess I got him to thank for the reason I started. Him running off. Had to help mama pay the bills some kinda way. Here you go. Thank you. Welcome. Hey. I went straight from daddy's house right to Doo's. I don't know what I would have done without him there to talk to people for me. I never had any problems talking. Course everybody around town figured was handing out hum jobs like business cards. Hum jobs? Yeah it's when you use your mouth. Down there. There's a name for that? Of course. They've got a lot of 'em. Lets see there's header, tongue party, french tricks, lip service. Pricknic, lunch box, gum job, goop gobbler. You... you're making these up. Gobbledegoop, kowtow cow. Woo! Thanks Miss Pasty. Knob bobbin'. Ham sandwich. Man eatin'. Patsy! Hello. Hello. 803 Maple Street please. Uh, wait can we make a different stop first? Alright. Wash up, babies, food's here! I called Patsy's room and Charlie said you left hours ago! These kids are near starvin! Well you're gonna have to learn to throw something together if I'm gonna be out on the road. Where the hell you been? I stopped by the Wilburns on the way home. To drop off the contract. You did what? Their mama's real sweet. She put plates together. Pork chops. They're a little cold, but... - What do you... - Doo! We talked about this. I gave it to Patsy to look at. She said she thought it was real fair. What good goddamned thing does Patsy have to do with any of this? You said it'd be a good idea to get an opinion from a professional. She's a professional. No I didn't say nothin' to anything... - Yes you did. - No I did not! Sure you did! Yes last night right before bed. Don't you remember? I ain't never lied to Doo before. Never. There. Hold still. Am I going to hell? For lyin' to your husband? Every last girl I know will see you there. He's so mad. He was supposed to drive me to this gig I got in Knoxville tomorrow night and he flat told me to take the bus alone. Want one of the Wilburns take you? No they're already on the road. I ain't never taken a bus alone. I ain't ever even played a show alone. That don't even look like I'm wearing make-up at all. Now listen I ain't gonna make a habit out of this cause holy hell sister, you better learn to swim, you're gonna be messin' with all them sharks but I wouldn't mind a trip to Knoxville. Patsy, really? Mmm-hmm. Dressing room's this way. We don't get too many singers, so you'll just have to make do. We're gonna be needin' half up front. What's that? Her fee. Half of it before she steps on stage. Wilburn said something about a Mooney. You Mooney? I'm Patsy. You got the money or not? Patsy, its alright. Well, Lamar? I'll go cut you a check. Cash. Right. You're on in 20. Yes sir. I know. I know everybody hates it. Yes, when I get some money saved up I'm gonna get one made. That sparkles. But for now this is as good as it gets, ok? Well, ok then. You practice in them things? Till I got blisters. Doyle made me. Up and down the halls of that dang office. You ready, sweetheart? Oh, she's good. Go on. Don't move. What do you mean? When he calls your name just stay right there. Oh Patsy, you're gonnabget me in trouble! No honey, I'm gonna get you paid. Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome to Knoxville, the latest country sensation from the Grand Ole Opry, Loretta Lynn! Loretta Lynn! Get your ass out there now! Half. Cash. Now.

Oh, you wanna tell 'em? I'll have the money to pay you after the show. Great. I'll go keep 'em company and you can go find it now. Is that Patsy Cline? Well, hello there. For those of you that don't know me I'm Patsy Cline. Oh, God. Now, my good friend Loretta Lynn is excited to sing for y'all tonight, but... Sing I Fall to Pieces! Oh, I sure would love to, but, uh... I don't know if you heard but I've been a little banged up. Its hard to get wind enough to sing when a bunch of your ribs is broke. Well, what you laughin' at? You wouldn't there. Get your ass out there. Ladies and gentlemen... Miss Loretta Lynn. Thank you. Well, lets hope I sing a little better than I walk. Now, what are you doin'... skatin' or walkin'? Well, I'm... Pick up your feet, girl. Well, if I pick up... There you go. Oh, those arms look real natural. Alright, now can you swing your hips a little? What? I don't know how to say this, sister. Ugh! Oh lord, just say it. How did you catch Mooney? What? How did you get his attention? Cause it sure wasn't by walkin'. Uh... pie. Pie? Mmm-hmm. He tried my pie at the school social and then he... he wanted to meet me after and he tried to drive me home in his Jeep. But I had never been in a car before, so I made him walk with me. Can I ask you something personal? Of course. Real personal. Got nothin' to hide. Do you... do you like makin' love with Charlie? Of course I do. Yeah. Most of the time. Doo gets so soaked in beer some nights, he just... If he's not too drunk to pass out, he's just drunk enough to get on top of me and... sweat. It ain't no fun. Charlie ever get like that? Charlie gets drunk, but we do alright in the sack. Truth be told, he hadn't been drinkin' much since the accident. It's been nice. Listen Loretta, You tell him no. And if Doo doesn't want to listen, you find something heavy and you make him. Hello? Oh, in here Mama! I've got a surprise for you. What? Patsy, you done enough! Oh hush!

Dottie West. Oh, Hi there. Jan Howard dying to meet you. Hi I'm June. Oh Miss Carter, it is an honor. I just love that song of yours. Oh, Thank you so much. Alright now come on sit next to me. Scooch over. Alright. I told Porter, he grabbed my ass one more time he's gonna have to learn to play guitar one handed. I won't stand near him. How do you get away? Every time I turn around he's just there. Hands where I can't see 'em. I missed you, Dottie. How long's it been since we all been home at the same time? Year? Two? We've been doing three hundred days a year so long, I'm not sure the point of having a home anymore. Gosh, three hundred? That's if you're lucky. And everybody wants you. Patsy is never gone see this dream home again. Now you show Mooney your playroom, babe? Hey Mr. Cline, fill me up. Your leg ain't broke no more. Make your own drink. Come on man. Just got a little chilly in here. One down, two to go. Whatta ya mean? The dream house. The silver Cadillac. And a fox fur coat. Once I get all three, that's when I know I've arrived. I'd be happy enough with the house. What's yours look like? Oh, I don't know, plenty of bedrooms and enough for all the kids, plus me to have my own for writing. And another one for Doo to pass out in. Tell me something, you ever step out on him? Heck no. Never. Why'd you think that? Somebody talkin'? No, just some of them songs of yours. No, that's just me guessing. Imagining what it might be like to to be the sorta person that does that kind of thing. It's maybe why I don't. Hmm. Things good with Charlie? Sure. You know you can tell me things, right? What do you mean? I just feel like I'm always telling you all my problems with Doo and you never... I don't know I just... I just don't want you thinkin' you can't tell me things. Just a lot of stuff with the house. And I had Carnegie Hall and those west coast dates. And you know I like everything just how I like it so everything took twice as long. Hey when do you head out with the Wilburns? Wednesday. For six weeks. On our very own bus. Your gonna want one of them lavender sachets. What for? Matter of fact, I think I got one inside. What? Why don't I just look for it tomorrow. What am I gonna do with out you? Who said anything about doing without, little girl? It's going to be me and you together forever. Three hundred dates a year. You're the one with the imagination. Hey you need to get something off your chest, you just picture me sitting right next to you. I'll be there. They fired our banjo player, this guy Teddy Dubs. He gets back to Nashville and has the nerve to fix his mouth to say he's sleeping with me. Course word gets back to Doo who lost his damn mind. That man drove straight through the night, clear down to Tuscaloosa. Wanting to drag my butt all the way back to Nashville. I tried tellin' him that idiot picker was lyin'. That this was my job now and he had no right interferin'. But he wouldn't listen. I didn't mean to hurt him, just knock some sense into him, like you said. But I guess that phone was heavier than it seemed 'cause I knocked his two front teeth out. He's fine, and I got enough money saved for a couple of fake ones. Course that means I'm stuck with those ugly drapes a while longer. Anyway I sure do miss you. Love Loretta. Mommy's home! Oh I missed y'all something fierce. Cissy! You must have grown two inches! I can almost reach the pedals on the truck! Well look out world. Mama, there's a new Elvis picture this weekend, can we go? Well sure honey, that sounds like fun. Oh boys you been good? Yes Mama. Welcome home baby. Hey honey. Well hey Charlie! Is that Pasty's new car? She here? It's a new car all right, but she ain't back till next week. I wanna check the traps. Now? Honey I've been gone for two months. And we waited for you. We'll only be a couple hours, don't you want to unpack? Why would I wanna unpack for, I'm leavin' again next week. Go in and lay down and relax you must be exhausted. You're not even going to take my bags inside? Tell your mama you love her kids. Love you mama! Welcome home, gal! Patsy! You are back! Surprise! Where'd those come from? You like 'em? What did I do to deserve you? Oh, somethin' pretty good I reckon. Well babies I gotta thank you for getting us such a delicious dinner. It was my trap that caught em. Mine too! Either way, that was some good cooking, ladies. Looks good on ya too. Well damn. Can we go outside now it's gonna be dark? Clean plates? Alright go on then. Jars are on the porch where you left them if you want to catch lightnin' bugs later. Thank you, sugar. Hey you want another one? Nah, I'm good. Alright. Now that the kids are out of earshot, you gonna tell her or what? Tell me what? Well we haven't told Julie yet so, don't say anything to the kids but... You're having a baby? Oh god no. Could you imagine. Well heavens, you sick? Oh jeepers Loretta, I booked Vegas! You booked? Oh Patsy! What the hell, Loretta? Honey, Patsy is playing Vegas! Congratulations. Aww thank you Mooney. Now it is more money than I ever heard of, let alone seen. Loretta... The fox fur? Three outta three. Patsy I'm so happy for you. Then what are you crying for? Because this is my best friend here and her dreams just came true. And if I wanna cry about it than dadgumit, I'm gonna cry. Now now when do you live? How long you staying? What are you going to wear? Well mama's working on a floor length black sequin number. It's real elegant. The run's six weeks. Seven days a week, if you can believe it? With all the driving and the holidays we'll be gone two months and change. I'm going to bring the kids out for Christmas. Palm trees and sand. Ho ho ho. So you'll be gone before I get back? See you next year! Well that's still just about the best news I ever heard. Hey I heard the Wilburns hired Harold Morrison to play banjo for you. You're gonna like him. What the hell does that mean? Oh that he plays good and bathes regular. You think I'm jokin'? Doo. She thinks I'm a joke. Relax Mooney. Damnit Doo! What the hell is the matter with you! - I ain't stupid Loretta! - Oh no you're not. You're drunk! You're out there every night, all that mess on your face! You think I don't know what their lookin' at! You think I don't know! You think I don't know what their thinkin'! You don't get to be mad at me when you wanted this more than I did! Jesus, Mooney! Hey! No no no wait! You go ahead and try it little girl, go ahead! I look like a little girl? In a damn bonnet! Let's get you outta here. Your going to lose more than your teeth this time! Let me be! Heard Charlie found the perfect song for you, and you won't even listen to it. We're talkin' about Charlie now? We sure are. I'm sick of talkin. It's your turn. He came home the other night and had been drinking with that new kid in town songwriter. Hugh something. Nelson... anyway. Came home with a new song of his at three in the morning. Mind you. And started playing it over and over and over, top volume. Hey babe I've got the perfect song for you. Woke up the kids. I swear, sometimes its like I got three babies. Still.

Mmm-hmm So the theatre is dark. You picturing it? Yes. Alright and the spotlight is searching the room and then bam there I am in the back of the theatre. And I'm walking down the aisle shaking hands as I go. Hey there sir. You know its real classy for Vegas, with a little hillbilly hospitality for the Cline. I love it. Hey why don't you come with me to Little Rock this weekend? Yeah you could open for me. I'll split the fee with you. I couldn't take half your money. Oh sure you could. I got a suite at the nicest hotel in town. And they've got a breakfast buffet with an ice sculpture you can't believe. No I t... I told Betty Sue I'd take her to that new Elvis picture. Take her when we get back. She'll understand. She might. I don't like going back on things with the kids. And I do? I didn't say that. You got it all figured out, huh? I got what figured out? Now, what are you talkin' about? Nothing. I'm going to get up to dinner.

It's me. What? What's wrong? What's the matter? You ok? I'm fine. How are you? It's four in the morning. I know. No post office in Vegas? I'm sorry for not writing. I just... I was worried about you. Oh, gal, you don't gotta worry. I just... I was just... I don't know. Embarrassed I guess. Well what for? The place is a dump. Well come on now, can't be that bad. Only difference between Vegas and the dumps I came up in is the size of my paycheck. Ain't that enough? Listen to me, what a jackass. I'm fine. I'm great. I just... If I gotta be away for so long. Be nice to be comfortable. Oh, but, huh, hey get a load of this. Randy bought a plane. What do you mean, like a toy? No, a real one, for flying to gigs. Who? Him and me. He got his license a while back. It will be great. And I can spend so much more time with the kids. For one offs I can flyout the same day and come back the next morning. You really gonna let that man cart you around in the sky? Oh, Randy's solid. Besides, scarlet fever, car crash. Third time will be the charm if it don't kill me. Patsy! Huh? Oh Sorry. Hey Patsy how are you? Well hey there little gal! Patsy that you? I'm damn near blind. Oooh, look at you! You ain't just a dish, girl! You're the whole dang set of china. Come here. Wait, wait, wait. Let me get a good look at her. Hey mister, can you get a shot of this? How's it feel, Patsy? Knockin' Kitty Wells off the top spot. Oh, well when you put it that way, Ralph, it feels mighty awful. Congratulations anyway. You too, Loretta. Thank you, Ralph. Patsy Cline, I'm libel to run up a gum tree and stick! That coat! Ooooh, let me touch it. Oh hey! Y'all just get here? No, no, we been gettin' our picture taken for 20 minutes. Apologies ladies, but mind if I get a shot of all y'all together? Well sure. Fourth favorite female performer. I never even thought I'd make it in the building. You'll be first next year. What? That's ridiculous. You're gonna win ten years in a row, just like Kitty Wells. Kitty won for ten years 'cause for 10 years Kitty was the only one. We shouldn't have taken that picture without her. So, we'll take another one. What are you doin'? You need a powder with a little more yellow in it. My powder's fine. For the bruise. Oh, my little rascal got to throwin' his wood blocks... Clocked me good. I almost forgot about that. Patsy. Charlie and I was just talkin'. Started out real calm. He quit workin', ya know. I didn't. Yeah. We don't need his paycheck anymore and this gives him more time to help with the kids, so less money for sitters. We was just talkin'. And its not like we don't... Well, sure we get to hollerin' plenty, but... And he shoved me a couple times but, never this. I don't know what went wrong. When? Couple weeks ago. Had his ass thrown in jail. Yep. Got a lawyer. Drew up divorce papers. Oh, Patsy. No I didn't file 'em. He was cryin' and beggin' and sayin' all the right things to get me to drop the charges and let him back in the house. He's been doin' real good since. Why didn't you call? Still got those papers on my nightstand, though. Right where he can see 'em. There he is. Hey baby, you want a drink? Loretta? I'm fine. You sure? You want a snack? I thought I saw some canapes around here. Hey... there's a seafood tower across the way - Y'all gotta see to believe. - I'm fine, baby. Hey... you seen Doo? Yeah, he's around here somewhere. You know what? I think I will take a drink. What you got? Another whiskey? You better get the hell away from my man 'cause I don't plan on takin' these rings off before I take you to fist city. Oh, we was just talkin'. Enough talkin'. I don't know what you think you saw here, honestly. Get my coat. Some son of a bitch stole it. Now, it probably just got hung with a different ticket. She's gonna find it. I just know it. I'm so sorry. Don't you say it. We don't have the coat. Ok. I'm gonna get my Mr. Dick here, we're gonna hire a couple of private dicks and if we find who stole my coat, I am coming for blood. So how long y'all back? Couple days. Hey, this'll fit ya. Then I got a one off this weekend, and then I'm home for three whole months. I swear, I'm gonna sleep for two of 'em. Hey, you can have this too. Well, if you don't like it don't take it. No, I'm... I'm being so stupid. I'm sorry. Hey, what's wrong? I'm not for sure. It's just a feeling, but... I think I might be pregnant again. How am I gonna do this? Why are you askin' me? You got twice as many. He's out there running around and I'm gonna end up all alone, five kids, no idea how the hell to feed 'em cause I can't sing no more. Now, hold your horses. Your voice broke? No, I just... I can't be doin' this pregnant. I was singin' at the Opry the night Randolph popped out. You know that story. I'm not like you. Now, don't you pull that babe in the Kentucky woods mess with me, Loretta Lynn. What's eatin' you? I don't want another one. Oh, well. Now, that's a different doctor. No. No, no, no. Not for me. All this time away, with kids who can come to the phone... I mean, that's... that's hard enough. But when they're tiny? How am I gonna do this? And if I don't, how am I gonna take care of 'em? Betty Sue is real good with the little ones. She... she'll help you. And you can get a babysitter. Maybe we can share. How are they gonna know how much I love 'em? Oh, hey now... You got the biggest heart I've ever known. Any baby of yours is gonna know how much it's loved. I hate the way it feels bein' away. You know? I'm not like you. I can't just turn it off. Is that what you think of me? Hmm? What do you mean? That I don't... that I don't miss my kids? No... No, Patsy, that's not what I... Hmph. Of course not! Patsy! Patsy, stop! Patsy, I'm so sorry! Its fine, Loretta. You just need money for a cab or somethin'? What? No. See! This! What?! No, I don't need money for a cab. What's wrong with you? I don't have the luxury of feelin' any damn thing I want any damn time I feel it. I have been workin' at this since I was a kid and I'm always one bad break from bust. Not that you would understand. Your husband just gives you a shove and you fall face first into a career. That ain't fair. Oh, its not? I don't get to break down, Loretta. Ain't nobody to pick me up. You got your mama. Oh, and who puts food on her table? I'm here. Just talk to me. Daddy didn't leave us. That's what we tell people. He married mama when she was really young. Like you and Doo. Mama started gettin' older and he didn't like that. I got older and he... We left him. In the middle of the night. Just disappeared. Never looked back. If I start cryin' I'm just never gonna stop. Hey come on. Let's get back inside. I don't want to miss my appointment. I need some new drapes. Wanna go shoppin' on Monday? Shoot yeah. Don't go! Come on, baby. It'll be a real quick trip. Mama'll be home soon. I'll be home tomorrow night, m'kay sugar? No. Monday. You forget? You said yes to that Cactus Jack memorial. I am so sorry. Really. I didn't... Monday's only 24 more hours from tomorrow, ok sugar? Why do you always go? I am so sorry baby, but this is how mama takes care of you. No! Hey, come on. It's ok if you're mad at me. I'm mad at me. You be as mad as you want. But I love you so much. And every minute that I'm away I'm just thinkin' about how I'm gonna get home to you, ok? I'll make daddy teach me how to count to 24 hours. I know we all loved Cactus Jack. He was a special part of our country music family. So tonight, I'm gonna sing his favorite of my records.

After an all night search involving bad weather, the plane has finally been located and all aboard have perished. You need anything? Can I feed ya? We just came to say goodbye. Ok.
