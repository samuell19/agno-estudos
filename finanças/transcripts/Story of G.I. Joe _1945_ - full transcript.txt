Ah, the kid's been waiting for a letter from her ever since we left the states. Guess you're getting off at the first air base, ain't you, pop? Why? Correspondent, ain't you?

No, geez, you don't have to do that. I hear we're getting in the real business tomorrow. Well, so far as I'm concerned, they can deal me out. The infantry ain't so worse. Look, this is a modern war, ain't it? And I'm a modern guy. And the modern age is up in the air. That's where I belong... Not down here. They only washed you out 'cause you're too big. It ain't your fault. I'll cut my legs off. If you had to sneak something out of the village, why didn't you bring something in skirts? Oh, I'm not... shh. Don't interrupt the music. Listen. Murder.

What do you mean, pop? Ernie. Ernie's a little way back. He's over 38. He don't need to be here. Be here?! He can even go home! Fall in! [ Groans ] Hey, how about getting my name in the paper? Harry Fletcher, Ashtabula, Ohio. What'll I say? Fletcher: Oh, anything, just so the folks back home see my name in the paper. Mccloskey: Hey, Ernie. Tell Cleveland Joe Mccloskey's winning the war, single-handed. Ernie: Winning the war single-handed. Joe Mccloskey, who mixed sodas in the corner drugstore, and Harry Fletcher, who'd just hung out his law shingle, Danny Goodman, who checked your oil in the summer and studied medicine in the fall. And here they are, with guns in their hands, facing a deadly enemy in a strange and faraway land. This was their baptism of fire. [ Explosions ] [ Rapid gunfire ] It was chaos indefinable, going up the brink of possible death in the nighttime. Puzzled, afraid, each boy facing the worst moment of his life alone. It was a battle without letup, and it was going against us. Only thing between us and them is Walker's gang. It's not many men. Yeah, it's a lucky thing the krauts don't know it yet. Strobel: Strobel to Walker. Over. [ Explosions in distance ] Can't seem to reach Walker. [ Telephone rings ] First battalion. Yes, sir. I see. No, sir. Colonel hunt isn't back from reconnaissance yet. Who is it, Ralph? Captain horton, sir, reporting four of his mortars knocked out. He's pretty badly shot up. Tell him to pull back to hill 148 and dig in. Right, sir. [ Dialing ] "D" company. Hello. Hello. "D" company. Hello. Hello. They don't answer, Colonel. Keep trying. Right, sir. Correspondent. Pyle. Hello. Hello. They're pouring more and more strength through the pass. Yeah, and despite all the fairy stories, one good green man can't beat a seasoned and crafty veteran, especially when the veterans got more and better guns, tanks, planes. One thing we can do is throw in Benson's tank. Benson's through. They knocked him out when they came through the pass. Well, there it is. All we got in front of us is Roberts' and Walker's outfits. "D" company. A little more than a company. There's some hot coffee and beans on the fire, sir. No, thanks. I think I could use some. Me too. Strobel: "D" company. Hello, hello. They don't answer, Colonel. Okay. [ Explosions continue ] [ Loud explosion ] He's beginning to split the plate. How's it going, Walker? Well, we're holding out okay, sir. Our phone went dead. Captain Roberts sent me up to see if there was... Well, if there was any change in plans or... what. No. No change yet. Better stick around for a while. Hello, bill. Hello, Ernie. [ Loud explosion ] Coffee? Thanks. [ Explosions stop ] Day to hunt. Day to hunt. Over. Strobel: Hunt to day. Come in. Over. Withdrawing tanks. Withdrawing tanks. Position, zebra-8-7. Zebra-8-7. Over and out. [ Explosions in distance ] Fleers. Put those papers in the fireplace. Burn 'em, sir? Not yet. [ Explosions continue ] [ Papers rustling ] Lieutenant Walker. Lieutenant Walker. What is it, Sergeant? Lieutenant Walker. Got to see the Lieutenant. Yeah, here I am, Warnicki. Never saw anything like it in my life. Never saw anything like it in my life, sir. Sir... take it easy. Take it easy, boy. Their heavy tanks... Overran our position... Point-blank. Point-blank, sir. I had to get out. Got some of the men behind the hill. Did the best I could, sir. [ Sobbing ] Did the best I could. [ Explosions continue ] Fleers, burn the papers. This is the first time I ever had to pull any outfit out of anywhere! I wonder when we're gonna start winning this war. Strobel, notify the company we're pulling out. We'll save what we can for another day. All right, men, on your feet. All right, men, on your feet! Hey, fella. Come on. He's dead. Strobel: Scram. Scram. Over and out. Strobel to Jones. Strobel to Jones. Come in. Over. Scram. Scram. Over and out. American boys beaten... Beaten badly. One of the few times in our history. It was a bitter and humiliating experience, and Joe Mccloskey was wondering what the folks back home in Cleveland were thinking of him now. As we look back on that first defeat and the bloody victories which followed, we realized that only battle experience could make a combat soldier. Killing is a rough business. Men live rough and talk rough. Jimmy: Jimmy O'Brien, 1918, state... Man: Hi, Ernie. Thanks for putting my name in the paper. You know, I dreamed I got a commission. Ernie: Selling what? Man #2: He is my buddy. Man #3: D-a-l-b-r-a-i-g-h-t. Man #4: I was a shoe clerk. Man #5: Waycross, Georgia. Man #2: Best outfit in the whole army. On a dull day, you can always get a fight in the army by arguing which is the best outfit. In a year, I'd been to a lot of places and learned to love a lot of men. But I always reserved one special place in my heart for the boys that I'd started with. Everybody else had a company, and I felt I had one, too... Company "c," 18th infantry. I hadn't seen 'em in a long time, and now I set out to find them again. They'd been through a lot by now... The conquest of sicily, murderous landings in salerno. Now they were part of the force hammering down the long, hard road to Rome. [ Indistinct conversations ] Hey, Dondaro! What town do we take today? San raviolio. Didn't we take that yesterday? Nah, that was San something-else-io. And I was wondering about wingless Murphy, Sergeant Warnicki, Lieutenant bill Walker, and a funny little mutt named Arab. All right, men! Fall out! Chow up! [ Indistinct conversations ] Fall out! [ Harmonica playing "Dixie" ] You know, when this war is over, I'm gonna buy me a map and find out where I've been. Mail call! [ Indistinct shouting ] Mew! Yay! Lopez! Yeah! Warnicki! Dondaro! Hey! Whoo! I'm a father! Yay! Warnicki. Warnicki! That's me. Oh, you're lucky. Letters for Captain Walker? Man: Come on, sarge! Sergeant! Yes, sir. Anything there for Captain Walker? Sorry, Captain. Nothing for you. Fleers! Well, let's get the rest of this stuff going. I'm excepting a letter. [ Indistinct shouting ] Ain't she pretty? Hey, what's this? Your insurance form. What's the matter with you? You forgot to put in a beneficiary's name. What's that? Anybody whose name you put down there gets the 10,000 simoleons. You mean anybody whose name who I put down gets... Yeah, and you better put it down before the next shindig, bub, or there won't be no dough. Stick your old lady's name down, and you're okay. I ain't got no old lady. Well, your old man, then. Ain't you got no relatives? Well, stick anybody's name down. You don't want to let all that wough go to daste... Day go to woughs. What? I said, "you don't want to let all that dough go to waste." [ Harmonica playing "oh, my darling, Clementine" ] Hey, sarge! What do you know?! Yesterday, I ain't worth a plug nickel, and today I can throw 10,000 bucks away just like that. Hey, what do you got in the package? Somethin' to eat? I don't know. Well, open it. How you gonna find out if you don't open it? That's an idea. It's from the old lady! Look what she's done. She had the kid's voice put on a record... junior's voice. He couldn't even say "mama" when I left home. Gee whiz! Let's listen to it. Ah, who's got a phonograph around here? Maybe they got one in the next town. Yeah! What are we waiting for?! Let's get going! Why don't you look where you're going?! Get out of that Jeep, and I'll beat your brains out! I... who you mad at? How are you, Warnicki? Why, it's Ernie! Hey, fellas, it's the little guy! How you been, ern? Seen any dames? Yeah, I brought you a couple, yeah. Oh, good, good! You're back, Ernie. I wanted to... What's been keeping you? Oh, I've been... We've been saving sugar for you, Ernie. Thank you, private. At last I met Ernie pyle. Now I can write the old man, and he can relax. Well, here we go again, Ernie. You know, every time you show up, there's a big battle. And the last time, it was Tunisia. You, uh, better check your dog tags, fellas. [ Laughter ] Yeah, that's me. I go around starting wars. Got to make a living somehow. Got to have something to write about. You know something else? What? My old man says I look like you. [ Laughter ] Good to see you boys. Glad to see you. Walker: All right, men! We're moving out! Ernie, how about borrowing your fingernail clippers? Hiya, bill. Hello, Ernie. I see you're going up in the world. Oh, these? Congratulations. Thanks. It's because I survived longer than the other looeys, I guess. All right, Sergeant. Let's get the men out of here! All right, men! Follow me! [ Indistinct conversations ] Ernie: Hiya, wingless. Hiya, Ernie. How's the air corps? Ah, I'm afraid the buddy system's got me. Me too. Well, you got an outfit now? You bet your life we've got an outfit. Pretty tough. They are tough. They're killers. They better be. [ Explosions in distance ] [ Gunfire ] [ Vehicle approaching ] [ Brakes squeal ] Push it right. [ Indistinct shouting ] [ Gunfire ] Tooling around with the infantry's no way to reach a ripe old age. I'm gonna build me a highway to Berlin over those... [ Explosions ] Okay, cover me, you guys. I'll get 'em. [ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire ] Where's your platoon?! Up the street! [ Gunfire ] Looks like this one's on us. Okay. I'll cover you. [ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire ] The promised land. Hiya, babe.

Si. [ Clicks tongue ] [ Gunfire, explosions ] There's that [Clicks tongue] war again. Sounds like they're paging me. [ Speaking Italian ] Honest, rainbow, this hurts me more than it does you. I'll be back. Don't worry. [ Speaking Italian ] [ Speaking Italian ] Okay? Okay? Okay. [ Gunfire ] Let's go to church, Warnicki! Okay, just a minute. You wait there, junior. Pop'll be right back.

Oh, you're g.I. Joe, huh? Gimme, g.I. Joe! Cigarettes no bono for kids. Here. [ Harmonica playing ] If this war don't kill me first, my feet will. Me, I feel like I'm 45. I feel like I was, too... And I darn near am. Mew: How old are you, Ernie? 43. I'm 26. If I knew I'd live to be 43, I wouldn't have a worry in the world. Oh, yes, you would. You'd be just like me, worrying about whether you'd get to be 44. Spencer: Hey, guys, we got a 12-hour rest. [ Speaks Italian ] Ross: Where's that whiz bang going? I know I'm gonna get some sleep. Hey, Murph. Hey, Murph! That red-headed nurse of yours is in town... You know, your fiancée. Is she? What a lucky guy you are, meeting the gal you're engaged to in the states way over here.

Snap it up, men! Snap it up, boys! Two minutes to lather, one to rinse! We ain't got all day! Come on! [ Indistinct conversations ] Hey, sarge, what's all that? This? Yeah.

[ Bell chiming in distance ] All right, men. Fall out. Look at that old monastery up there. Huh? So peaceful. You'd never think there was a war within a thousand miles of it. Or a thousand years. Well, maybe you're right about the krauts pulling all the way back to Rome. I don't get it, though. If they wanted to slug it out here, they can make it plenty tough. [ Rumbling, explosion ] [ Bombs whistling, explosions ] Get me artillery fire control. Hello, Pete? This is Walker. You know that building up on top of the mountain? The monastery? You call it that if you want to, but I call it, in military terms, an observation post. If you don't want to get us all killed, you'd better give it the business. Can't. Got an order about it...

I'm a catholic, and I say bomb it. Dondaro: Check, brother. I got a wife and a kid. Think I want to die for a piece of stone? Why wasn't I born a 4-f instead of good-looking?

[ Sniffs ] [ Coughs ] What's that, a secret weapon? Grappa. Grappa? Italian moonshine. You get a purple heart with every third drink. [ Sighs ] Me, I'd rather have the good ol' Albuquerque sunshine. Yeah, it must be pretty nice in new Mexico this time of the year, huh? Sure is. I always wanted to get out west. Oh, someday, maybe. Well, if you do... Look us up. That girl and me will show you how it's done. You married? Well, yes and no. I wanted one thing. She wanted another. She walked out. Chapter closed. I don't know. Names. I've been pulling old names out, putting new names in. You know, you're not the only writer in this outfit. I've been writing, too... Jones... Peterson... McCarthy... Spitofsky... Smith. "Dear Mrs. Smith, your son died bravely today on the..." [ Scoffs ] And the... the new kids that come up. That's what gets you, the new ones. Some of them have just got a little fuzz on their faces. They don't know what it's all about, scared to death. I know it ain't... I know it ain't my fault they get killed, but... Get so I feel like a murderer. I hate to look at 'em, the new kids. Here, drink up, Ernie. Here's to faid pass, fila beach, salerno, oran. Ohh, yeah. I'm tired. Well [clears throat] you'd better try to get some sleep. That reminds me of w.C. Fields' sure cure for insomnia. "Get plenty of sleep." [ Chuckles ] Names and addresses. And the hills to be taken. [ Chuckles ] You'd be simply amazed at the number of hills still to be taken. Ernie, why the devil don't you go home? I often ask that myself. If only we could create something good out of all this energy... And all these men. They're the best, Ernie. The best. Yep. Well, it's a world the other world never know. Even the air force. Up there, they approach death differently. When they die, they're clean-shaven, well-fed. If that's any comfort. But the g.I... Well, he lives so miserable and he dies so miserable, you j... [ Snoring softly ] Walker: Dondaro! Nice time? I always like to see one of my men get some relaxation. You know, Dondaro, it'd give me a great deal of personal pleasure to break every bone in your body! Goofing off down there was one thing! Up here, it's another! Now get out of here before I kick the... Wait! Report to Sergeant Warnicki. Tell him you're gonna dig latrines for every man in this company from here to Rome! Nice deep ones. You're lucky, Dondaro! You're learning a trade! [ Laughs ] When this war is over, I'm gonna write a book exposing this army. Hey, Dondaro? Tell me, confidentially... Was it worth it? [ Clicks tongue ] [ Airplane engines roaring ] Hey, fellas! Look! Look! [ Indistinct talking ] [ Speaking Italian ] Yee-ha! Here they come! Boy, ain't they pretty? It won't be long now. Okay, Steve! Let's go! Warnicki: Come on, men! Ernie: General Eisenhower had made his decision... Bomb the monastery. "He said," if we must choose "between destroying a famous building "and sacrificing our own men's lives, then our own men's lives count infinitely more." [ Explosions ] [ Indistinct shouting ] Here was one of the grim ironies of war. The very rubble of the monastery became a fortress for the Nazis, and they stopped us cold. We were right back where we started from. Warnicki... ain't he back? We better take him some coffee. Keep an eye on him, too. When we gonna hit 'em again? 18:00. Coffee, Captain? No, thanks. It's hot. No, thanks, Pete. Tough time getting back, sir. What kept you? Shut up. Shh. Woman: Hello, Steve. Say "hello" to your daddy. Come on, junior. Junior: Hello, daddy. Hello, daddy. I'll kill 'em. Come on, junior. Come on. I'll kill 'em! Hello, daddy. Hello, daddy. And them... Hello, daddy. Them! Hello, daddy. Hello, daddy. If it wasn't for them, I'd be home with junior. Hello, daddy. Goodbye, Steve. I love you. I'd be home with little junior! I'll kill every mother's son of them! I'll kill them! Grab him! [ All grunting ] Let me at 'em! I'll kill 'em! I'll kill every one of 'em! Warnicki! I'll bloody kill them! Warnicki! I'll kill every one of 'em! Ow. [ Mumbling ] Hello, daddy. Hello, daddy. Hello, daddy. Hello. Take him to the medics. Go on, junior. Go on. Say "hello" to daddy. Hello, daddy. Hello, daddy. Walker: All right, men. Let's do something about that. [ Explosions ] The machines had done their best, and it wasn't enough. Now came the time, as it comes in every war, when the greatest fighting machine of them all, the infantry soldier, had to go in and slug it out. [ Gunfire, explosions ] [ Triumphant music plays ] Where you from, Joe? Louisiana. Louisiana? Good. Man: Cassino looks a lot better from this side! Man #2: All away to Rome! Yeah, I got a good telephone number there! [ Harmonica playing "Dixie" ] Hey, fella, do you know where the 18th infantry is? This is it. Ernie: "C" company? What's left of it. Man: Hiya, Ernie. Howdy, long shot. Where you been, Ernie? Oh, spreading it around. Hi, Ernie. Hiya. Welcome to this side of cassino, Ernie. Finally made it, huh? Guys moving up the road look kind of chipper, don't they, Ernie? Sure do. Well. Hi, Ernie! Hi, Ernie! Hi, Ernie! Hi, Ernie! Long time no see. That's right. We kicked the door open, and those guys make the grand entrance. Let 'em have their fun. They're still young. Got an extra chair here? Oh, yeah. Have one, Ernie. [ Groans softly ] Glad to see you, Ernie. Thanks. Haven't you eaten that dog yet? [ Laughter ] [ Harmonica playing ] [ Music stops ] Come on, fellas. Give me a hand, will ya? It's Dondaro. It's the Captain. I'm sorry, old man. [ Dog whimpers ] [ Voice breaking ] I sure am sorry, sir. [ Somber choral singing ] All right, men. Let's go. [ Woman vocalizing ] That is our war, and we will carry it with us as we go from one battleground to another until it's all over. We will win. I hope we can rejoice with victory but humbly, that all together we will try, try out of the memory of our anguish to reassemble our broken world into a pattern so firm and so fair that another great war can never again be possible. And for those beneath the wooden crosses, there is nothing we can do "except perhaps to pause and murmur, "thanks, pal. Thanks."
