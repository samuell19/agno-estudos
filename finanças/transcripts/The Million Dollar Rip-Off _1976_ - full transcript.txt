â™ª [DOOR BUZZING] Seventeen. [DOOR BUZZING] Excuse me. Oh. -Hey, hey... -All right. Give it up, give... Let go of me. What are you doing? MAN: Hey, get your hands off her. Hey, wait a minute, look at this. -Hey, hey, let go of me. -Get your hands off her. -Hey, wait. I'm a police officer. -All right. Show your badge. -Can I see your badge? -I don't need you people to tell me that. She's right here. I got her son. May I be of assistance? Hey, is there a problem? -There's no... -There is no problem. I'd like to be of assistance. Sir, that person just lifted your wallet. [CLAMORING] [GRUNTING] Would you cut it out, Jessie? You're driving me up a wall. I have an army of butterflies in my stomach, you expect me to hang loose? -Where are they? -KITTY: I don't know. How's your stomach? Not too good. -[KNOCKING ON DOOR] -Oh. Oh, you guys you made it. What happened? Oh, it's about time you showed up. I've already been through two bottles of stomach pills. Yes. We were beginning to think maybe you stopped to take a few curtain calls. Well, we should have because it was a great performance. At least until the cops showed up. Oh, God, no. Yeah. Two of them, semis, they busted a dip on the train. When those badges flashed, man, we split. Took us to... We ran three blocks before we found out that we didn't even have to. The disguises worked. We were eye to eye with those cops, they didn't suspect a thing. KITTY: We were so excited. We... I... We didn't know where...where you guys were when you were late. JESSIE: Oh, I'm so glad you guys are okay. I was so worried. I've...you know, I went through all my stomach pills. KITTY: Am I hurting you? HELENE: Nope. JESSIE: Oh, it's sticky. HELENE: Oh, believe me that million and a half is just as good as in our hand. Want to bet? How many times do I have to tell you to keep the door locked? Oh, I'm sorry, Muff, it was my fault. I mean, I thought something happened to you guys and I forgot. Let me tell you something else you can forget. You can forget about knocking off the Transit System Collections for 1.5 million dollars, because I'm calling it off. But you can't, Muff. You planned the whole thing. Yes, I planned it. For three years in a stinking cell in Joliet and I'm not going to watch it blown by a bunch of amateurs. Hey, make up your mind, Kitty said you wanted amateurs. Some lousy pickpocket grabs your wallet and you take off like a 747. I didn't know what else to do. I was afraid those cops were going to see through this disguise. I didn't know this thing worked. Terrific. So, you're leaving me a driver's license and your photograph instead? I never thought of that. Hmm, you're lucky I did. How did you get that? Same way she lost it. Oh, no. You mean you picked that detective's pocket? But if you've got Helene's wallet back, we can go ahead just the way we planned it. No. She panicked in a tight spot so could any one of you. I mean, face it, you're not cut out for this kind of work. You and your make-up. Look, I knew why... Honey, honey, I know what you're going to say, but it won't work. -Now, I'm a professional, right? -Mmm-hmm. Okay. I should know, the girls panicked, they blew it, it's not going to work, so let's not discuss it. I don't know, Muff. I don't think they... Honey. In other words, I don't have anything to say about it anymore. About us. That's the first time in over three years, Muff. Don't put it that way. I mean, if it hadn't have been for you, I never would've made it through Joliet. -And if it hadn't been for you... -What? -I think I would... -What? I don't know. It's funny how much a letter a week and one visiting day a month could do. Yeah. -We really had it, didn't we? -Oh, yeah. A lot of big dreams, future, house, kids. -Lot of kids. -How many kids? Five, seven, nine. Oh, this was going to make it happen. It'll still happen, someday. How? But what I make at being a saleslady... Or what you make at the fix-it shop? [LAUGHING] How much was it last week, Muff? -Um, seventy-five. -What? $75. $75? It's about what had cost me to make the bug for the Transit System phone. But that was a charm, so is everything else. Except for the girls. Do you want to risk the next 10 years of our lives on Lil's make-up, Jessie's stomach, and Helene's nerves? For our share of a million and a half dollars, I'd take a chance at Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Can you get them? Come on. You thought of everything, it can't miss. Oh. Come on. Let me go out and tell the girls you've changed your mind. -I got a better idea. -What? Why don't you stay in here long enough, so that they'll know you've got me to change my mind, huh? -All right. -Okay. -[PHONE RINGING] -[TYPEWRITER KEYS CLACKING] -FOGHERTY: Yeah, yeah. -I'm sorry, Lieutenant, I have a red alert out here. What do you think I've got in here? Red alert, huh? You start smoking again? FOGHERTY: Oh, put out that cigarette, please. What's the Big Megillah? We got some mutt sitting in the middle of the southbound track of the state subway, crying because he's afraid of the dark. Well, if he's afraid of the dark, why did go in there in the first place, huh? For the same reason, I work here, because I hate sunshine, fresh air, and smiling faces. FOGHERTY: Oh, Frank. Frank, I've outgrown this job. I mean, I need a promotion. I got the same complaint, but nobody ever listens. FRANK OVER TRANSMITTER: You know, all I ever do is fill out forms and sign them. Ah, you will make out all memos in triplet get orders of the chief. [SCOFFS] Chief? Chief? We do all of his downfield blocking and he comes off like O. J. Simpson. Oh, you carry that grudge like a knife in the belly. Oh, yeah? Yeah, why shouldn't I, huh? And what about that kid Muff Kovak, the one that used to work here in electronics maintenance? You mean the kid who was making the blue boxes in the repair shop? FOGHERTY: Yeah, yeah. What's so funny about that? FRANK: Well, he must have turned out about a hundred of those boxes all on our time with our materials. FOGHERTY: Yeah, as if we were paying him a salary to rip-off the phone company. But, you know, he was a smart cookie, give him a little wire and screw driver he could've beaten NASA to the moon. And after I tracked the kid down for three months, for three months and I'm ready to make the bust, what happens? Chief sends me off on a wild goose chase, he makes the bust, he winds up with the promotion and what do I wind... I wind up with a gold cigarette lighter, huh? FRANK: The chief. LUBECK: Hi, friend. I heard you were out. So naturally you hurried right over. Let's just say, I waited until I could do you a favor. Favor? What, like the last time? That cost me three years. Lubeck, level with me, those blue boxes I gave you for 50 bucks each, what did you sell them for? Five hundred, huh? Seven fifty? Eight. Eight. It's a business, friend. Don't take it personally. Besides, I'll make it up to you. Right now, I could use a couple of blue boxes. Ask the CIA. You make them and plan them for me and I'll cut you in for half. Mmm-mmm, half or no half. And I'm sorry, I'm in a new business, I'm legit. Yeah. I noticed. Oil and adjust vacuum, $7.50. Chip tuner $22.50. How much are you going to make on penny-ante stuff like this? More than I made making license plates. You got to understand, I was in the same room for three years and I'm not the same person. So, I got a lot of work to do, why don't you do us both a favor and split, okay? Suit yourself, friend. But in case you change your mind, you can always reach me at this number. Don't bother giving me yours, I've always had it. Right, baby, just as you said. Yeah. He turned off the speaker the second I walked in the door. He must've been listening to the tap on the transit security. No, no, no. No sweat now. Just go along with everything he says. Just let me know in case he changes his plans, all right? Yeah, right. Okay. FOGHERTY: I don't know about you, Frank, I've had it. Come on. How about a beer before we go home, huh? FRANK: I think you need it and I can use one or two, just give me a minute to call in the signals. You got it. Security dispatch, calling Armor One. Armored one, ready for signals. Go ahead, Frank. Man, how was your daughter's birthday? Ah, the usual, couple of kids with belly aches, ice cream all over the drapes and the dog ate a couple of party of hats. FRANK: That sounds like fun. Okay. Here we go. I'll give you the rotation on the stations and then the password numbers. First, Madison 88, second, Logan Square 21, third, La Salle 36, fourth, Quincy 11. Shoot them back then. Madison 88, Logan Square 21, La Salle 36... Slower, slower. And Quincy 11. What was that last one? MUFF: Quincy 11. -Aren't you going to write them down? -Oh, I got them. -You sure? -Mmm-hmm. -Really? -Yeah. Okay. Now, there's something very important you all should know. For security reason, they change the rotation of the stations, the pick-up points, the numbers and so forth, every day. Any deviation and they if something's wrong, which reminds me I need Fogherty's gold cigarette lighter by tomorrow. What do you need that for? Insurance. If the phone line goes dead, I want to be in touch with Fogherty at all times. Muff, I can't just waltz into his office and lift his lighter right under his nose. Yes, you can, Lil, if you want your cut of the action. Use the old lady bit, I don't care how you do it, now, are you in or out? I'm in. Good. Real good. Now, that we know you're in, while you're at it, take the knob off his roller file and replace it with this one. Hey, wait a minute, Muff, that's not my field. I know, but I also know you can do it. I get it, in case, he leaves his lighter somewhere, we can still have him bugged. See? Didn't I tell you, she's bright and beautiful. That does it, except for you, Jessie. You've got a date in, um, 32 minutes with a guy who drives a set of $50,000 wheels. Charley. Now, this is the exact spot, okay? Now, you stop here and you fake engine trouble. -How long do I stay? -Um, two minutes. -Then you move out. -What time do I have to be here? Um, 12:20 or you'll miss the train, okay? Okay. Oh, thank you. Good morning. -Have a seat please. -Are you Lieutenant Fogherty? That's right. Ralph Fogherty. Now, what can I do for you today, young lady? Don't patronize me, young man. I've come all the way from the Sunnyvale Rest Home to protest the way the transit authority discriminates against senior citizens. I don't follow you. Do you or do you not give a reduced fares to senior citizens? Yes, ma'am, we certainly do. Now, all you have to do is present your identity card... And you'll completely ignore it. What's that? I said they won't take my card at any station in the city. Do you mind if I see it? Not at all. Here it is. Well, are you satisfied? Not quite. Um, are you sure that this is your card? Of course, I am. Would you like to see some other identification? No, no, that won't be necessary. Oh, no. Please, I insist. Here. Check the names, check the birth dates. FOGHERTY: I think I see the problem. LIL: Really? Yes. Is this your most recent photograph? Well, let me see. Well, I must admit I've had a few pictures taken since then. But this one has always been my favorite. If you don't mind my saying so, that photograph must be 40 years old. Now, if you want them to honor your cut-rate card, you must use a recent photograph of yourself. And have every ticket seller in this system think I'm an old lady? Hardly. Bureaucrat. Okay. Charley, the bags go in there, no later than 1:00 p.m. No problem. It gives me 40 minutes to get from 72nd Street to here. Good. [WHISTLES] That's a lot of bread for one lousy pick up. Hey, between you and me, what's really going to be in them bags? Between you and me? Garbage. I think it looks great. Well, once you get the lighter back to Fogherty, we'll have him right around the clock. Well, how do we know it works? [OVER TRANSMITTER] What if he has to add fluid? The unit is in the shell, he wouldn't even notice it if he has to change the flint. Oh, Muff, you're a genius. -This is true. -I know. When do you take care of the transit authority command center? Tomorrow. Once I tap into the warning signal line, I'll be able to stop the train for as long as we need with this. Oh, I hope so, Muff, or I'll need more stomach pills than I can carry. And just remember, sweetie. After you replace the lighter, get out and forget the curtain calls, okay? Don't worry. It's going to be all right. How do I look? -[WHISTLING] -MUFF: Bravo, bravo. I hope the surroundings don't bother you, but in our situation, discretion is very important. Yeah. Is this discrete enough for you? Quite. Well, now, who will accompany the deceased? The names are on the paper. Hmm, and when may I prepare the body? We'll have it by 1:00 p.m., on the 8th. Are you sure there won't be any problems? The dead go flying out of Chicago just as easily as the living. Oh, thanks. Oh, boy. [STATIC] Oh, this thing. No, no, it's coming from that phone. [STATIC] What? That's a bug, Frank. Come on, why would anybody bug me? FOGHERTY: I tell you, Frank, it's got to be the collection. Oh, gee. I got it. I'm sorry. If it isn't the collection route then there's no other reason for putting that device in your phone. You keep forgetting big brother. Come on now, Frank. Come on. The chief doesn't need a bug to know what I'm thinking of him, scamming around here leaks like a sieve. And he doesn't need a bug to know that I'm bucking for his job. And I tell you, it's gotta be the collection route. FRANK: Okay. Okay. So it is the collection route, what do we do about it? FOGHERTY: We give them just what they want. We set them up. And then just when we're ready, we make the kill. Huh, good work. -I better tip the chief. -Why? -Well... -Why? -Ralph, I... -No, no, no. Why? So he can let us do all the work and then cut us out of the action again? -Oh, come on, we... -No, no, Frank. This is our ticket upstairs. This one is for ourselves, right through all the bureaucratic bull. Frank. JESSIE: I knew it would never work. All those rehearsals and we never even get to raise the curtain opening night. Ta-da. Four tickets to Zurich, Switzerland leaving Tuesday. And here's yours, you... Yeah, you join us a week later. Where, in the Chicago sewers or would you prefer the garbage dump? I don't get it. What's... What's with all of you guys? Fogherty found the bug in the phone. All that guff about amateurs and Mr. Pro blew it himself. Helene, there was nothing wrong with my bug. There had to be something wrong with the phone line, I don't know. So get off my back, okay? It doesn't make any difference how it happened. It just did. We just have to find another way to finish the job. Have you flipped? With Fogherty expecting to get hit any minute? No way. Please, Muff. If we could wait three years to get this close, we can hang in there for just a couple of months more. And what if they found one of the other bugs by then? We'll be right back where we started. Can't you see? Walking into a trap. I'm willing to take that risk. For you and me. Honey, if we got busted and you wound up doing 10 to 15, I couldn't take that. Not to mention the rest of you. Thanks. It's four to one, Honey. You're out-voted. We're calling off the hit. That's what you think, friend. Who's he? He's the reason you keep the door locked. I'm flattered. But that's no way to talk about your new business partner. Business partner. Since when? I've decided to cut myself in for 50% of the transit heist. What you mean transit heist? I don't know what you're talking about. Let me refresh your memory, friend. About the bugs Lil planted in the roller file knob and Fogherty's lighter. Face it, friend, I've got too much time invested in all of you to let this operation go down the drain. And if you think I'm bluffing... LIL ON TAPE: What if he has to add fluid? MUFF: The unit's the shell, he won't notice it if he changes the flint. KITTY: Oh, Muff, you're a genius. MUFF: Yes, this is true. KITTY: I know. HELENE: When do you take care of the transit authority command center? MUFF: That's tomorrow. Once I cut into the warning signal line with this, I can stop the train for as long as we need. JESSIE: Oh, I hope so, Muff, or I'll need more stomach... You think you're the only one who knows how to plant a bug? I've had you wired for months, lady. I've have every word you've ever said about the transit heist down on tape. You quit now and it goes to Fogherty and you go back to making license plates. No. No deal. I'm going to take my chances. I thought you'd say that. What about their chances, Muff, hmm? There's a lot of ways ladies could get hurt in this town. He's bluffing, Muff. He wouldn't dare. [ALL SCREAMING] You still think I'm bluffing? Any of you? Good. The full operation goes exactly as planned. And I'll be around to make sure you don't make any last minute changes. It's a business, friend. Don't take it personally. FRANK: And remember, I want a 24-hour surveillance on every one of the collection stations. Shut it off. Please, put it down. You know what really burns me? We take all the risks and we only get 50% of the take. Don't complain to me. Lubeck would have never bugged the shop or the apartment unless one of you told them we were planning the transit heist. In all of the spot to be in, huh? Now, I don't know which one of you not to trust. If you feel that way, Muff, why don't you just pull out? We don't go through with this, all but one of us go belly up in the river. Well, and if we do pull it off? That means we stay alive. There's only one way it can work. We've got to convince Fogherty that we only hit one spot instead of three. And how do we do that? We give him a decoy. Give him something to shoot at. Somebody he recognizes. Somebody from the old days. FRANK: That's three collection days in a row he's been hanging around the station. MAN: It sure looks like a stakeout. Ralph, do you want to check and photo ID? No, don't bother. His name is Kovak. Allan Muff Kovak. Joliet, class of '75. -I want to know every move he makes. -Okay. Muff Kovak. After all this time. It's hard to believe. It could be just a coincidence, Ralph. Knocking out the transit system doesn't make sense for a penny-ante schlepper who specializes in blue boxes. Blue boxes and bugs like the one found in your phone. Now, don't underestimate our electronics Einstein. He's taking a big step up in this world. Okay. If you're right then we know who we're up against, probably where he's going to hit. The question is when. Soon, Frank, very soon or else he wouldn't risk blowing his cover. -Like Monday. -The day after tomorrow. How do you figure? Well, we don't collect Sundays, right? So there'll be two days stake in the till. So all we do is just spoon feed them all the poop by the bug. And I'll be calling in the armored car schedule and the station password numbers. That's right. That'll give him 48 hours to make the biggest mistake of his life. Listen, man, I want no trouble. You guys want to make some money? North side bag man is coming around the corner. He's got a blue coat on. What's it going to be, pops, in or out? Hey, if you don't mind to squeeze. Excuse. Watch your tool box. What kind of a security officer are you anyway, huh? [SLURPING] I asked you to do one simple thing, just tail a guy, and you wind up being mugged. It wasn't a total loss. I made the color. Oh, that's great. While you're rounding up a couple of two-bit hypes Kovak gives you the slip. No telling where he is now. It beats me why those two... Those two creeps kept yelling for me to hand over the take. They think I was some kind of a bag man? Scusi,this is where I get off. Honey, now that Fogherty's on to me, I don't want anybody going near the fix-it shop, so we monitor the bugs from here. Okay. You think of everything don't you, love? -Yeah. -I know. I got to split. -No. Come on. Just stay, okay? -I can't. The girls won't be back until later. -Mmm. Where did they go? -Um, Jessie went to a movie. -Right. Said she needed something to settle herself down. And Lil is out buying make-up and nose buying, see? What about Helene? I don't know. She made a phone call. Said something about a sick aunt, left in a hurry. -Was it a local call? -Oh, I think so. Yes. That's funny. Helene once said she didn't have any relatives living in Chicago. But we've prepared the late Mr. Borg for his journey home exactly as you requested. Why these last minute changes? I think this should more than cover any inconveniences. Very generous. The ladies will be very disappointed when they reach Zurich. Only one of them. -Now, I tell you, Ralph, we're in trouble. -Why? We can't keep this from the chief much longer. We won't have to. They're bound to hit us and they're going to hit us today. All we got to do now is let them know where to do it. Okay. Security dispatch. Calling armored car one. MAN: Armor One ready for collection route and password numbers. Okay. Here we go. First, Madison 17. Second, Logan Grand 26. Third, Quincy 9. Fourth, La Salle 52. Security dispatch signing off. -Think he took the bait? -He's got to. He's got to. Remember, he doesn't know we're on to his phone bug, remember? Now as soon as Muff makes his move, I'll tail him all the way to the action. Come on. Nothing new here, Frank. Now, I tell you, for a guy who's about to knock over the transit collection, he sure is playing it cool. Why shouldn't he? He knows the route. He's got the signal. -So far he's betting a thousand. -[CLICKS] Yeah. Well, I think it's about time we throw him the curveball. Okay. Armor One, this is security dispatch. MAN: This is Armor One. Go ahead. FRANK: We've got a code change on today's run. MAN: Code changes? Is something wrong Frank? Nothing's wrong. Just take it down. It's a check on some new security procedures. MAN: We're going to be late if it's another route. Same route. Different password numbers. Now here they go, in order. [PHONE RINGING] Yeah. Muff, it's Kitty. They've just changed the password numbers. They what? I just got the call. The new password numbers are 38, 17 and 75. -What about the collection route? -That's still the same. There's no sweat. Just give the girls the new numbers and we're safe. Jessie and Helene are still here but Lil's already gone. She wasn't supposed to leave for another half hour. I know that, but she had opening night jitters and she couldn't sit still. Can't Jessie or Helene catch up with her? No, not a chance. Jessie's got to get over to the train yard. Helene's got to change disguises at the station. It's up to you, honey. If you don't get to Lil before she hits the Madison Street station at 11:15, she'll tip off every cop in Chicago. I'll do the best I can. What about you? Same as always. Fogherty's outside, keeping an eye on me. One more thing, honey. You hear a cop or see a cop, you get out of there. I can always find another scam but not another you. I love you. [KISSES] -I love you. -Take care. What are you trying to do, you bugger? Oh, I didn't mean to hurt you really. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [PANTING] [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING] What's going on, Frank? FRANK ON RADIO: Armor One just took off to make the collections. Where's your friend, Muff? FOGHERTY: Right where he's supposed to be. At La Salle Street. FRANK: Good. I've got five of our best man waiting for him. Pretty. [PANTING] I'm sorry. There's been a new password number, 38. Okay. I got it. Thirty-eight. [BUZZING] Thirty eight. Would you get a load of that? Yeah, they hire anybody these days. First stop. Smug little creep. He's acting like he hasn't got a worry in the world. I don't like it. FRANK: Relax, Ralph. Armor One is due any minute. So, unless he can fly, he won't be knocking us off here. [BUZZING] Thirty-eight. Thirty-eight. MAN ON RADIO: Frank, we've been hit. What? What? -FRANK: We've been hit. -How did they get the code? I don't know but they had it. And now they got over half a million bucks. This whole thing was a put-on. They never were gonna hit us here. All units to La Salle Street. Repeat. All units to La Salle Street. Kovak is at the west entrance. Pick him up fast. You heard me. He got away. FRANK ON RADIO: What do we do now? What do you do now? You keep looking. And what's the news from Logan Square? Great. Armor One made the pick up right on schedule. Good. Good. That means Madison was a one shot. All right. Now listen...listen carefully. Get me an APB on a Muff Kovak and get me a search warrant. You hear me? A search warrant on his shop and his apartment. Will do. And no reports. I repeat. No reports to the chief. Not until we have him in our hands. I'm going to get me that little punk. That'll teach you to follow unescorted girls into dark places. Don't let me stop you, fellow. Just protecting my investment. [DOOR BUZZING] About time you showed up. Who are you? Where's Murphy? He called in sick. He got the flu or something. You don't sound too good yourself. Yeah. Well, the... I'll see you tomorrow. I promise the wife I'd get home for roller derby reruns. Okay. Tell her I said hello. Okay. See you. Hey. What do you got in the bag? Oh, that's dirty clothes. My wife's at Women's Lib, and I got to take care of my own wash. Yeah. It kind of reminds me of my sister-in-law. A real weirdo. Phew! Hey, you got any cigarettes? Ah, no. I can't smoke. Got a cut in the throat. Why don't you try over there in the file cabinet? I think I saw some over there. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. Yeah. Yeah. Everything... There's nothing. There's nothing. No cigarettes. Yeah. Well, why don't you try chewing gum? It's much better for you. -Come on. Fill me in. -Madison hit must have been an inside job. What makes you so sure? Come on. Look, somebody knows something for sure. Even with the change of the password number. -Are you sure about that? -Positive. Snyder, please. Never smoke on my face, all right? Okay. [DOOR BUZZING] [BUZZING] Seventeen. Okay. All right. Let's go. Come on. Hey, you know what? That smoke shop down at the corner, it closes in five minutes. Hey, that's right. Yeah. You need a cigarette, right? -Thanks for the idea. -Yeah. Believe me, my pleasure. You better get going. I'll phone in the report. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on and save me. [DOOR BUZZING] -Seventy-five. -Bingo. I'm working on it. -What's the hurry? -Sorry. I wonder what happened to Muff. I don't know. Maybe he spotted the real guard and decided to split. Helene, pros don't split. MAN ON RADIO: Security dispatch from Armor One. Come in Armor One. La Salle Street, they've been hit. -Hit, La Salle. -What? When? How? A couple of minutes ago. The same way they worked Madison. They used a phony guard for the pickup. No, no, no. Now, you just tell me, isn't anybody on the ball out there? How could that happen twice in one day, huh? Make it three times. They hit Quincy Street too. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's impossible, see? Because I was there myself. I saw you pick up the bag, remember? I know. I know. We're just holding it up. It's full of gravel. [HONKING] You look like a million and a half dollars. Oh, really? JESSIE: Thank you. -: Hey, okay. -I got some gold here. Here I come. Oh. Ooh. He's not there. He's not there. Oh, no. What do we do? All right. I can stop the signal light as long as we needed this. Jessie, are you sure you told him the right station? I don't... I don't know. I... Oh, the only thing I'm sure of is that I think I'm going to be sick. Oh, dear. Center, this is Ravenswood 433. Why have you got me on hold? MAN: We didn't red light anyone. The board just lit up like a Christmas tree. Here he comes now. Here he is. Oh, oh, it's about time, Charley. I was... I was down to my last stomach wafer. Hey. Oh, careful. Careful. All clear. [TRAIN HORN BLOWING] All right. You get up. Go on. I'll take care of it. I'll take care of it. All right. Hey, Moe, the train. Madison, Quincy, La Salle. That means we've got at least three guys to worry about, plus Muff. I knew I should have brought him in to begin with. For what, loitering? Suspicion of bugging a phone? We didn't have a single charge we could make it stick. Yeah. We got a million and a half now. Hope he gets a hernia just lifting it. [PHONE RINGING] Jarret, yeah? You're kidding. What? -About what time? -What? -You're not going to believe this. -What already? At 10:40 a.m. this morning, some weirdo clobbered the trainman in the yard and took over a garbage car. Garbage car? That's all what we need now, a garbage car. Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. The 433 Ravenswood line, that's a garbage car, right? -Mmm. Right. -All right now. Each hit was made before armor car reached any of their pickups, right? Okay. Now, check the schedule. Go on and check the schedule right now and I'll lead you 3-1 that the Ravenswood 433 line was at each station just around that time. Okay. You see, we never figured on the hits being before the pick-up. That train is our getaway car. -The garbage car. -Yeah, yeah. Now, where is the train now? -At the end of the line. -I'm gone. Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. I can't wait any longer. Come on. Put it down. Let me see what we've got. All right. Let's do this. What's going on here? Go through every piece of it. Come on. Every piece of this stuff. What is this? FOGHERTY: All right. Come on, Muff. You were all over the Madison/Wells Station for three days. Why? Why not? Oh, we're going to do jokes. Did you hear the one about the million and a half bucks in the garbage train? Fogherty, this job must really be getting to you. Quit stalling now, Muff. We got you dead. You got nothing. You got a problem and you're looking for some guy to pin it on. Well, it ain't me. I'm just trying to be nice, Muff. Now, come on now. I'll get you a short sentence if you cooperate. [PHONE RINGING] That's it, Muff. Jarret. Yeah, he's sitting right here. No money, Ralph. FOGHERTY: What do you mean no money? Thirty-six bags of A-1 garbage. I don't care what anybody says, Frank. If somebody rips off a garbage car, they intend to use it. Can I go? Where's the money, Muff? Listen, for the last time I'm telling you, I don't know anything about any money, so either book me or bounce me out of this dive. Get him. -All right. Go on. Beat it. -Thank you. You guys seem so worried about money. I'm going to let you have a couple of... You crummy punk. I could book you for bribery. Do you mind? No, not at all. Come on, get out of here before I change my mind. Think...because I'd love to shove that wallet right down his throat. -You would, huh? -Yeah. -And blow the best lead we ever had? -What are you talking about? There was an airplane ticket in that wallet, Global Airways. Could you read the flight number? No. But it doesn't matter for now, does it? Just get on the phone and find me every out of town flight today for Global Airways. If you don't cut that out, your stomach is going to be solid. Hey, listen. Something's got to hold me up. My nerves are going. They're gone. Just relax, Jessie. Everything's worked perfectly so far. We're long way from Zurich and I don't think I can make it on the plane. Listen, just let me do the talking and remember, you're in mourning for Uncle Harry. Uncle Harry, got that? Uncle Harry. Yeah, Uncle Harry. -We're running out of time. -Yeah. No kidding. -All right. What have you got? -Yeah. We've X-rayed every piece of baggage going in flight 108. It's all plain. What about the carry-on stuff? Let's check it at the gate. Are you sure you got the right flight number? -Oh, come on. -I'm positive. Now, look, they bought five first class tickets all to Switzerland and all from the same travel agency. So, that means that those four guys are in the waiting area right now just waiting, ready to board. But still no sign of Muff or the money. I know that punk. He's figured out some way to slip it onboard at the last minute. Coffin's ready for boarding. Coffin, what coffin, huh? Yeah. Hand me that board. Hand me the board. The name is Borge, Harry Borge. -You don't think... -I know. -Hey. -Come on. MAN OVER PA: Flight 108 for Zurich now boarding at Gate 11. -Fogherty, here's the ticket. -Thank you. -Well, that's a lovely. -How many are there on this... Excuse me, ladies. Do you mind telling me who the... I beg your pardon. Who are you? Oh, Lieutenant Fogherty, Chicago Police department. -Oh. -Who's the extra ticket for, please? It's for my sister-in-law's uncle. Really? Where is he? -He's dead. -Uh-huh. You know, you have to pay regular fare for a body on the airlines now. I mean, it's absolutely criminal, but it happens... Criminal. It is indeed criminal. Let's see how criminal it is. Follow me into security, ladies. -I don't understand. -We have plane to catch. Just follow Sergeant. I know. If you'd kindly let... Now, do you have a warrant? If you want me to get a warrant, it will take that much longer. -We have a... I am not... I can't believe you. Just go right into security, ladies. Just follow Sergeant Jarret right into security. You have every right in the world. Please go in the... Just keep walking. It's nothing wrong. It's just routine. Please. KITTY: I don't know what this is all about, Mr. Fogherty. But you better have a very good reason for making us miss our flight. Oh, but we do. It's called the late Harry Borge. We're checking his coffin. KITTY: Why, you are all heart, aren't you, Lieutenant? You know, you're speaking about her Uncle. It's okay, Jessie. We're going to take you to the ladies room and... Sorry, no way. No way. What did you find? Her uncle, dead and dead broke. There wasn't a dime in that box with him. Satisfied? Or do you want tear out any more of her guts? I'm sorry. I didn't know. I... You can take her with you as soon as she feels up to it. I appreciate your cooperation. Oh, yeah? Well, I think you'll change your mind when you hear from Jessie's lawyer. What? Coffin's empty? Why that two bit little... No, no, no. No. No, don't worry. I know where to find him. I'll find him and the money. Muff. Oh, heard it all. Well, it's not as bad as it sounds. No. It's worse. You know, when I let Fogherty see my plane ticket, I knew he'd follow it all the way to the airport, all the way to the coffin. And I even knew somebody would start screaming once you found it was empty. I never thought it'd be you. I love you. I love you. Then why? [WHISPERS] Just tell me why. Remember the house? -Remember the kids you promised me? You... -I remember. That's all we've talked about for three years. I tried. I tried and I tried. I was so lonely. I know. And Lubeck was so understanding. You really blew it, honey. Now, you both get nothing. Nothing. Now, what do you think you are doing? What does it look like? I'm beating the chief to the punch maybe by resigning before he fires me. Come on, Ralph. Oh, oh. Hey, you all right? Damn, that thing almost burnt my hand off. Another bug, Frank. Look at this. It's just like the one we found in your phone. So that's how they knew every move we made. All the way to the airport, Frank. All the way to the airport. Wait a second. Remember that big dame in the security office? You know, the nervous one that fainted when we told her there was nothing left in the coffin, but her uncle? I have to admit. We were kind of rough on her. Yeah, maybe. Maybe not. Maybe that wasn't why she fainted, huh? Maybe she was just as surprised as us when the cover was bare. Double cross, they switched somewhere along the line. That's right. And what's more logical a place than the mortuary, huh? -All right. -Get on the horn, Frank. Check out and see how many funerals are scheduled for today. And maybe with a little luck, maybe we'll get to bury Muff Kovak. [SCOFFS] I'll keep this. My lighter. "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. "He maketh me to lie down in green pastures, "he leadeth me beside the still waters. "He restoreth my soul, "he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake." It's a Wellington Funeral over there. Yeah, I don't get it, Muff. Why do we have to come all the way out here to watch the burial of a perfect stranger? You don't know how strange, Jessie. He's resting on a million and a half dollars. You mean you had someone switch the bodies? No, just the nametags. That way, we come back, we dig up the bread and we're set for life. Now, he tells us. And I almost had a nervous breakdown back there. Jessie, I'm sorry. I couldn't let anybody in on the switch until I found out who was working with Lubeck. I'm sorry it turned out to be Kitty. PRIEST: ...in the house of the Lord. Let us bow our heads now in silent prayer. Stop. Stop. Stop. -Hold it. -What is the meaning of this? Sorry, Reverend. It's a police matter. All right. The four of you, all under arrest. What? Is it against the law to pay respects to an old friend? FOGHERTY: Only if the friend is loaded with someone else's money. Read him his rights, Frank. Now, we'll open up the coffin and then we'll see if they can explain away the million and a half bucks worth in the late Mr. Wellington's pocket. -It is my... -Did you say Wellington? That's right. Robert A. Wellington. That's the name on the bulletin board. Well I'm afraid someone has made a terrible mistake. This is the Ashton Funeral. I officiated the Wellington Services an hour ago. FOGHERTY: An hour ago where? Over there, of course, at the crematorium. Oh, no, the money. What money, Fogherty? I need a smoke. I can't smoke. What money? The money you were going to use as evidence? It's up in smoke. I don't believe it. You've got nothing to worry about, girls, I'm telling you. We're both losers, Fogherty, can't you see that? MAN: Fogherty was eventually promoted to Chief the day they installed new cigarette machines in city hall. After passing enough bad checks, Kitty and Lubeck finally got the good life... Behind the bars of state prison. Jessie's ulcer vanished, but when she started operating a milk bar in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Lil gave up the uncertainties of show business for a career as a skydiver. Helene married Muff who finally found a way to go straight without wasting his cunning criminal mind, but he's now a used car dealer.
