Are you sure? Here only? It’s a full moon day and the roads are empty. We're getting married in two months. Can you not wait till we get married? Only if we see the trailer... ...we'll be curious to watch the full film. You're so naughty. It’s all your uncle’s blessings. Hey! Who is it? Go! Go! Go! Stop the car! They just wait for it to get dark! Fleeting romance. Keep quiet and drive the car. Now if you do not kiss me I’ll stop the car for sure. Oh God! Please make it fast. No! Please make it fast. No! Just keep quiet and drive the car. Don’t unnecessarily waste time there is so much to do! Oho! I really don’t know why I came with you. Hey, please. Okay! Just one on your cheek. Hey watch out! Please help me! I'm in danger. What happened? Three of them are chasing me! Please help! Please get in the car. Go! Go! Go! You seem to have been unusually hurt. Shall we go to the hospital? No! Please take me to the police station! That’s why... ...you should never get married to a good looking girl. People like your own neighbours keep eyeing her. Instead, get married to an average-looking girl... ...and everybody will respect her. If the wife is not great looking... ...it is assumed that the husband will be safe. Will you just stop it? Do you know why have I come here? What has happened to me... ...and what I’ve gone through? Do you know the seriousness of the situation? Hello! I am very jovial by nature. If I become too serious... ...doctor has told me that it might affect my heart! Sir please try and understand as to why she has come here. Oh! Yes sir! Hey constable... ...write down their complaint! Okay sir! Sir... ...I have been gang raped! What did you say? Can you not hear me? I have been gang raped. 3 men have attacked me! Now can you hear me? If it was your daughter... ...would you have asked her in the same manner? Hey if it was my daughter... ...I would have thrashed her for being out at this hour! I should blame your parents! Where the hell is he? Let’s go! Father what is wrong with you? An injustice has happened to me. How can I let it go? What will you get out of it? You will get nothing! I feel really bad for you to have gone through this! But time will heal you! Leave it... ...let’s go! Being a law graduate... ...how can I let it go? OK. If you have decided to fight... ...then fight alone. Please write down. Hmm. So is this the place from where they abducted you? Yes sir. What were you doing here at such an odd hour? Are you done? Do you feel good now? Don’t you know that you should not pee in front of a lady? Sir I can control anything but how can I control this? Strict penance. I was once travelling from Bangalore to Bombay. The journey duration was about 18 hours. When we reached Hubli, I really needed to use the loo... ...but I controlled till I reached Bombay. Sir, did you use a diaper? Hey making fun of me? I’ll beat you up! Go! Go from here and check the CCTV camera. - Yes Sir! - Go The government has fixed CCTV camera at all points of the city. But how does anyone know if it’s working? Sir, please be serious! We have come here to prepare the Mediators report. Hey you don’t have to teach me! So you were saying that you got kidnapped from this point. From which point did that couple pick you up? Sir over there. Sir this is the place where they picked me up from. Hey Swami! Do you know why this particular road is so famous? Why sir? In the night this particular place is secluded and there is no other disturbance. Okay let’s get serious! Let’s come to the point. Hey Swami, from the double road how many routes lead to this point? There are 6-7 routes, sir. In one of the ways the bridge has collapsed. Sir, in one of the shops they threw my mobile from the car. That particular shop was being shut. Which shop? Who is that person? Which route did you take? I’m not really sure, sir? You yourself do not know and you are teaching me? Leave it! Let’s move on! Hey Swami please take her and find out if there is any evidence that is pertaining to the rape? Go with them and show them the spot! Hello Miss... ...you should have actually clicked a selfie with those criminals! You guys click selfies for fun but how did you lose out on this? Enough of your tough looks. Please come to the station tomorrow morning. We’ll need to get a medical test done! Hey 'romantic couple,' please drop her home! Be careful. Thank you for your support! Being human can we not help this much? Please take care of yourself! Sure! Thank you! Bye! What happened? Madam your breakfast is ready. Ganga hold on! Today is 10th! I came yesterday morning... ...have I slept the whole day? How is it possible? I don't know anything. Ganga you definitely know something. I don’t know anything. Please ask your father! Ganga! Father... ...what is this? Have I slept the whole day yesterday? How will I know? Ganga give me coffee! Make it strong, hot, and add less sugar! Father why are you behaving like this? Don’t you know that I had to go to the medical test yesterday? Don’t talk to me about that issue. I told you that I don’t want to be part of it! Unbelievable! Even after so many years Hanmuntha Biryani hasn’t changed the quality of the taste! Hello Sir! Oh! That girl’s father. What happened? Do you also want to get a medical test done? I have made my daughter sleep. She will not wake up today. Tomorrow if she comes... ...ensure that the medical test is not done! Thank you. Hello Madam! Cool down! Why are you so tensed? Try and be a good citizen! Do you understand? Go! I’m telling you for your own good! Sir, let’s leave soon! What is this Miss? You’ve come so late? Sir, I really don’t know what happened... ...but it’s very important to get the test done within 36 hours. Ok. My wife and children have taken the police car! Sir let’s take my car. Hey have patience! I’m telling you there is very less time... ...and you are being so negligent! Hello! I had asked you to come yesterday! You have come today! I told you not to have a bath or change your dress. You have come like as though you’ve dressed for a party! Hey lady constable take her! Sir what I’m saying is... Come here and sit! Sit here. I'll complete my formalities. Is she the girl who got raped? What is your name? Nandhini. When did the rape take place? Was it a gang rape? It happened the day before yesterday. You have brought her so late! Come inside! Was she wearing the same set of clothes when the incident happened? No she has taken bath and changed her clothes! Then what will you get during the test? Please get something done! Go inside the room! Get yourself changed the doctor will arrive soon! Why are you so stressed? When there is a problem there will always be a solution! Someone is messing with me... ...and I don’t know who that person is! Medical test has been delayed beyond 48 hours. According to 2012 report... ...medical reports are not compulsory with respect to gang rape cases. But the medical reports would appear as negative! I do not have any other evidence. I also do not know who those 3 criminals are. I don’t think I will get justice. Mohit Misra V/S State of NCT of Delhi 2015... ...could not conduct a medical test And they traced the dead body only after 2 days. The circumstantial evidence matched... ...and the accused was punished based on 9 evidences. You will need to focus on... ...finding out as to who those 3 criminals are. And how will you reach them. [Dubsmash] [Dubsmash] [Dubsmash] Hey artist! How much time will you need? Sir, she is not giving me a clear brief and she is confusing me. Why Miss? Tell him properly. How did they look like? It’s none of this, Sir! I’ll just need to see them one more time and I will be able to tell you. Those 3 men looked like... Hey play the music! Sir, sir, sir! Sir! Sir! Please call the inspector! Who is it? Are those the culprits? Yes Sir! It’s them! Did you take a picture? Did you note the car no.? KA... I'm not able to remember, Sir! Why are you hesitating asking for money? The work is important and not the money! Is this enough? What is all this? You can do anything for money? I’ve looked after you like my own. Nandhini leave her! Her daughter is not keeping well... ...which is why she was in need. Even you have a daughter right? God forbid no other girl should face anything like this. But if your daughter was also gang raped... ...then would you have done the same thing? Nandini! Oh God! Enough is Enough! You need to stop talking about what has happened! I have given you enough freedom to live your life. But the system here is corrupt. It’s been 2 weeks... ...has any progress taken place towards the case? Months and years will pass by but nothing will happen! Please go back to London! You were so happy for 2 years! There is still time. Before the media and public shames us... ...please take back the case that you have filed. Think about it... ...before it’s too late! Your case will be nominated for Guinness records. You have failed so many times. In a place where river flows in a fast pace... ...your case doesn’t seem to go anywhere and it remains stagnant. The customer you are trying to call is out of tower reach. Sir is not here. He has gone to Bangkok with family... ...and we do not know what he’s doing there. When you are not sure of what is going to happen. Remember this! In between you and your goal... ...the thoughts of whether I will be able to achieve it or not... ...are the only nonsensical thoughts that hinders us from achieving the goal. You have to fight alone. You will be alone only till you win! Naveen! Yes Madam... Since when have we been visiting this place? Since 6 months and almost 2 times a week. And whenever we have come... ...the bill shoots up to almost 800-1000 Rupees. And we are finding it difficult to pay that much. So... So what Madam? Assume that she is your Uncle’s daughter... ...and let us go without the bill. Look! Anything can happen tomorrow. You might even propose... ...and she may even agree to your proposal. And you never know... Your pair would look really cute! You could either accept the offer or we could pay the bill. It's okay madam. This my number! You can call me anytime! My name is Nandini. I am a gang rape victim. I’m not posting this for any kind of likes or comments. I want justice. This incident took place on August 8th at 10:30 pm. I absolutely have no idea about these 3 people. Even when someone touches you with a bad intent it feels so disgusting. But these 3 criminals have behaved even worse than monsters. But our society expects us to be silent... ...otherwise it would ruin our name And I may not even get married. But I don’t care! If someone else is bad... ...how does that make me a bad person? Being a law graduate... ...I complained to the police thinking that I will stand by the truth. But the police have not taken this case seriously. I’ve been shuttling around for 3 months! But they have been dealing this case with utmost negligence. This incident reminds me of this horrific act every night... ...and I’m not able to sleep as well. I’m not the girl who will only cry and accept defeat! I will fight till I get justice. If you think injustice has happened... ...your support would mean a lot to me. It’s a request! Nandini! Nandini! Get up! Get up! What is this nonsense? Why are you screaming in the morning Father? Why are you so adamant despite all my warnings? What happened Father? Did you check your phone? Your video has gone viral on social media... ...and news channels have captured it. My phone is switched off. Why are you smiling? Do you understand the consequences of your action? Father, I want to be alone for some time. [We want justice] Hey, what happened to that old minister? Oh that ex-home minister? Madam I think he is on the verge of dying... ...and they have asked us to be prepared. Oh no! Let him die after my shift... ...otherwise i’ll need to cover the story. [We want justice] As you can see... ...hundreds of youngters have gathered for Nandini. To protest in front of the Commissioner’s office. Let us talk to Nandini and find out as to what has happened. Could you please tell us why are you protesting? I think everyone is aware of the injustice that happened to me. The police is not showing any interest with respect to this case. I have no hopes that it will materialise in to anything constructive. Hence, I would like the crime branch to take over the case. And I have come here to request the commissioner to give me justice. This is Nandini’s and thousands of peoples' request. We’ll now need to wait and observe the police’s response. Cameraman, Ohilesh... Is this some cinema shooting? Carry on! Carry on! Who is this idiot? Take the shot again! What is today’s bulletin headlines? About share market, madam. Because of the impact of dollar and crude oil, the share market has hit an extreme low. Hello! Ok sir! Madam, there is a breaking news about Nandini Vardhan. I’ll keep the content ready. You get ready soon. Oh god. This girl has no other better job! She isn’t going to get justice... ...nor will those rapists be punished. This is 'BIG BREAKING NEWS!' You are aware that the Commissioner has handed over Nandini Vardhan’s case to the crime branch. We all hope that Nandini gets justice now. The person in charge of the crime branch for this case is Mr. Parathasarathy Brahma. He is one of the most sincere officers. There is not even one case that hasn't been unsolved by him. Mr. Brahma will join the live telecast soon! Let’s take a break. News and social media have been buzzing about the same issue. They have been targeting us since 2 days. Ignore them sir. Let them speak! We’ll do our job. This case has now become very sensitive. We’ll have to solve this case within a month! Why? What is the problem? Sir, 22nd of this month is my brother-in-law’s engagement. Brahma, why are you not understanding the seriousness of this case? We don’t have much time. Sir, you are actually underestimating my efficiency with respect to my speed. I will solve this case by then. Jai Hind, sir! Were you standing here and looking for a drop? Yes sir! According to the Mediators report... ...your car broke down at that spot? Yes. Didn’t you call anybody from home? Sir, it's just my dad and I, at home. My dad had informed that he will not be available till 10:30 pm. He has raised me to be independent, sir! So I didn’t call him. Sir, it's very easy to solve this case. There is a CCTV camera present here. Let’s take the footage and zoom in on the car. We’ll get to know who the owner is... ...and he will be the culprit. I have already had a look at the CCTV footage. Nandini was asking for help! An SUV with three boys was passing by on the opposite road. They went a little forward and took a U-turn. They came to this spot and then kidnapped you. I wonder from where they were coming at that hour? My favourite hero Darshan’s film just released. They have would have gone to watch it. Idiot! Sir... ...they must have been coming from the petrol bunk. Or they must have gone to a dhaba on the outskirts of the city. Hmm... A gang rape happened, and it took place at 10 pm. I suspect they must be coming from a liquor shop. After writing a report of the investigation you kept mum about it? Is it? You did not investigate further? Sir... This is a typical excuse given by people who pawn off work. Where the hell is your SHO? Sir he has been touring. He will come in 2 days. Ask him to graze the cows instead. Ask him to meet me after he lands. The SUV and those 3 boys must have been captured at least in one of the CCTV footage. You will first need to check. Yes sir! Sir, one minute! Can you please come back? I think this is where my mobile had been thrown from the car. How many secluded places are there from this location? 3 to 4 deviations. Do one thing... ...search every deviation possible from here. If they have passed through this route, we will definitely get some clues. Boss, if we take the car how will you go? Oh, got it! Walking is good for health. We’ll go walking! You have come to attend the medical test two days after the incident. Why? Even I’m not able to understand, sir! I have never slept like that. Someone has drugged me. Do you suspect anyone? Yes sir! A girl has complained about her gang rape... ...what the hell were you doing? Don’t talk like that sir. I’m sparing you because you’ve worn a uniform. Else I would have thrashed you! Rascal! Sir but I’ve already worn it. It’s all over now. Why don’t you just dump this case? All your illegal business and earnings will hit you one day! Ayyo! If all that he is saying is true... ...then all those who are bad should have landed in hell! Instead they are having fun and being at peace! Sir, on the route to one of the farmhouses there is one CCTV camera. The same car has passed but the no. is not visible clearly! Those rapists must have been roaming there. Do one thing! Scan every road and house in that particular route. Hey! You idiot! In detail. Ok boss. Sir... Nandini’s mobile has been traced. Another sim card has been used on the same phone. I need to know who is using that mobile and bring that person here in half an hour. -- Go! -- Yes sir. The truth will now be exposed! Tell me! Sir it is true that girl was screaming for help. Somebody had thrown her phone from the car. I really wanted to call the police and inform about the same. But my wife called... ...and asked me to mind my own business. She asked me to come home. So I switched off the phone and kept it inside my pocket, sir! I’ve been asking my dad to buy me the latest smartphone. I happened to notice this phone lying around. So I’ve been using the phone since then. Did you notice the car no. ? or the colour of the car? Or how many of them were present in the car? Sir, the colour of the car was silver. But I couldn’t see anything through those windows. But I saw a monster’s sticker stuck at the back of the car. The couple who had signed on the investigation report... ...had also mentioned about that car sticker. Whoever those criminals are... ...I need them in custody within 24 hours. How sir? We’re unable to find out as to who they are. We’ll need to search for what we don’t know. If we are determined to find them at any cost, we will find them for sure! Sir! Sir! Sir... Her stomach has gotten upset. Can you please call the doctor? Leave it it’s a family problem. I’ll give her medication and she will be fine. Relax... Sit down! Take! Take and swallow the medicine. Oh god! What happened sir? Instead of giving her medication for tummy pain... ...I’ve given her medication for constipation. And now you will end up having dysentery! See you forgot about your pain! I was joking. I gave medication for your stomach pain only. At 9:55 pm, Nandini’s car breaks down. She asks for help... ...but 2-3 cars don’t seem to stop. In this SUV those kidnappers arrive. They abduct her. The distance between the spot of where they kidnap her to the place where they rape her is about 4 kms. To reach that spot there are 8 different routes. At this hardware store they throw her mobile phone. The car has passed in front of Inchara farmhouse. This is the place where she gets gang raped. They also tried to attack her... ...but she managed to escape. Suspect no. 1 is Kamalesh Laed. He happens to be ex-minister Jagapathi Laed’s son. Suspect no. 2. Srikanta alias Kanti Kotwal. He is Corporator Mariamma’s son. Suspect no. 3 Bhandary urf Sapota. He manages pubs and gymnasiums funded by his friend Kamalesh. The mobile tower location and the crime scene matches. Kamalesh has swiped his credit card at the wine shop. We’ve found his bracelet, car’s tyre marks, beer tin fingerprints, etc. at the spot. We have 11 evidences corresponding to the crime scene. Fair enough! Kamalesh happens to be an ex-minister’s son. This will lead to a lot of political pressure. Hence... ...we should arrest them without any clue given to them in advance. Okay? Yes sir! Okay? Yes sir! Come let's go. Yes Swamy sir, boss is here. I’ll hand over the phone to him. Sir the crime branch is heading to arrest your son! What? Where is that useless fellow? Dial his no.! Sir, his phone is ringing but he is not answering the call. I think he was born to make my life miserable. Call the driver! [Cursing] --Oh, you just arrived? Where is your doting son? Do you know what he’s been doing? Where else will he be? Wherever your son is, my son will also be there! Before he gets arrested, call the lawyer! You can never talk anything good. Hey! Who are you? Didn’t the ASI call you and inform you that youwere going to be arrested? Oh so you are the person from the crime branch? Drink as much as you want, eat as much as you want... ...and take as much as money as you want! But don’t spoil my mood! Now... Get out! Hey! Grab him! Hey officer! He is my son... ...and those are his friends. Just leave him! Today, court has already closed for the day. Next two days are holidays. Try doing something on Monday. If the luck favours, a good judge will be able to bail them out. You are making a big mistake. If you had warned your son this situation would have not come up. He cannot escape this time. Sir! You have arrested Kamalesh Laed, Kanti Kotwal, and Bhandary Urf Sapota. Have they gangraped Nandini Vardhan? They are just probable suspects. The court will decide soon on the same. Sir you are known to finish the case in a very short span of time. And people say that you are very brilliant. What is your secret? There is no rocket science to this. I do not spare even the silliest of clues. It’s just an observation. I try to see my cases from the lens of an outsider... ...which gives a new dimension to the case. Even the tiniest of clues can help in solving the case. We have to search in that direction and I exactly do that. 3 of the suspects belong to political background. You might be pressurised from higher authorities. Aren’t you scared? If I was scared I wouldn’t have stepped forward. Hope you understand. [Singing...] Shut your mouth! I’m banging my head to understand as to what is happening. Somebody has locked us. Are these the 3 suspects? Yes sir! It’s them. Okay. On Monday you will need to record your statement at the magistrate's office After that the charge sheet will be filed. Thank you so much sir! Why are you thanking me? No sir... ...you have reinstated my belief in the judicial system. Even my father did not support me. I just did my duty. If justice can be given to the good and the bad can be punished... I don’t think anyone else can be happier than me. Sir... These kind of people should not live. They should be hanged. Thank you sir! [Singing..] Keep drinking and die! Sir my boss has started to doubt me. Your new boss has been around only for 2 months. I know you since 2 years. So don’t worry at all. I’ve tried to warn you repeatedly. But none of you took my words seriously. So why are you feeling so bad? There is everything except a bed and air conditioner. Don’t worry! Oh she’s so beautiful. I’m not able to recollect as to when and where we have raped her. Car, bus, train, swimming pool, changing room, and our drama theatre. You guys have not left any place. You are professionals. As though you are a saint! Hey leave all that! We were not in our senses when we raped her. But this time... As long as we live we should make it memorable for both of us. But this time... Then let’s rape her before we get high. I feel really sad that we cannot remember anything about this beautiful girl. Sir shall I leave now? Hey, call my dad! Call his dad and not yours. Take it sir! Fatso! Hey godfather! When are you planning to bail us out? Come! Let's go! Hey lawyer where are you? Break this! Attention please! Here we come! Hey ask your daughter to take the case back! Or else... ...I will kill you! I’m warning you! Be careful! Father! Nandu! It is true that we have to fight for justice. But we will first need to be alive for us to be able to fight. On behalf of Brahma, I apologise. Don’t worry sir! Nothing has worsened yet. I’ll handle it from here on. Okay sir thank you. They are ordering us to close the case. What are you saying, sir? Do you have any ideas how horrible those 3 boys are? They have ruined so many lives like Nandini's. It’s only her who has taken a lot of courage to come forward. When it’s our responsibility to give them justice, how can we do this? In this situation whoever lends money gets to rule! They have the power to even sack us from our positions. Hope you understand that. So are you planning to take me off from this case? I don’t care. They are nobody to decide the fate of this case. It’s going to be me! How much are they quoting? 5 crores. 5 crores? Sir why are you caving to such a small amount? Let us take the case to the court. Let it reach the threshold... ...then we’ll be in a better position to bargain. They are pressuring us to close the case right away. The ball is in our court. Media is also buzzing about this issue. Tell them that your hands are tied due to the pressure and escape from this situation. Let the charge sheet get filed. What if they get caught after the case is filed for charge sheet? They won’t get caught sir! There is a major evidence missing from this case. Okay! I trust you. But if something goes wrong... ...the consequences are going to be dangerous. Sir this is a very materialistic world. They get to play the game when they can. But this time the ball is in our court. Thank you! I will be filing the charge sheet by tomorrow. The case will get to the court. The government will appoint a public prosecutor to defend on your behalf. Now it will be in their hands. Sir, on behalf of the prosecution I intend to fight my own case. and I would like to request the court to grant permission for the same. Since its being dealt with criminal proceedings. it is difficult to grant permission with respect to state cases. Anyway try your luck. Thank you sir. So you wouldn’t withdraw from the case at any point right? Why would I do that sir? If someone tries to scare you or blackmail you... ...or they try to settle the case with money? I’ve seen about hundreds of cases like this. Sir... Then mine would be different. Sir I was trained in law by my Guru. And I respect him a lot. I have utmost faith in the system and the judiciary system of this country. The truth will always win. And I will fight till I win. God knows as to which world does this girl belong to? Faith and truth I believe... ...I haven’t seen a more ignorant girl than her. Nandini don’t break down. You should not be weak at all in this situation. Not at all. We have only succeeded 10 percent in what we had planned. There is nothing to worry. The plan seems perfect. You keep quiet. Do you think it’s as easy as hogging your food? If you think it’s going to be easy it will be easy! We shouldn’t get carried away by our complacency. There will definitely be someone to outrank our brilliance. Correct! Do you have any idea as to who the defence lawyer is? Shyam Prasad! He will rip the case apart. He is extremely criminal-minded like his dad. Shyam... ...what would you like to have? Chivas Regal! Double peg... ...on the rocks! Lawyer sir! Please win this case at any cost... ...and relieve my son and his friends. If that happens I will serve a feast in your name to this entire city. Bannur special. You thought I would melt for all this? You’ll need me now in this situation. You want me to win the case... ...and I need money. Also I need a high in winning a huge case like this. It’s very simple. Give and take. Mr. Shyam... I had met your father. You are exactly like him. It is obvious that I will be like my dad and that’s normal. If not isn’t it abnormal? I’ll take your leave now. Oh please stay! Why are you hurrying? I will not exceed my limit with respect to my talk and behaviour. I’ll take your leave now. It seems like you don’t know the seriousness of the situation. I’m worried about my son. I believe that girl is also a lawyer. 20,000 students have passed out from my batch. For my age and experience nobody has become as successful as I am, except for one or two. Everyone who wears a black coat doesn’t necessarily become a lawyer! Cats also belong to the tiger family. You know what I mean right? Goodnight! Don’t you think he’s a little mad? Not a little but completely. Oh god when my wife was alive I had bread and jam. Now for my daughter also I’m making bread and jam. If my mother were alive... ...she would have tears in this colour. Good morning father! Good morning dear! Father, it was very difficult to put up a scene with you. But for a change... ...I quite enjoyed it. Father! What to do? We had to act like a villain in front of that maid, Ganga. That crime branch officer had called and enquired about her. Leave it! It’s all done now. We even packed her off to her hometown. No it’s still not done yet. These informers will still be looking around. So be very careful. Don’t roam around with your friends too much. Even if they get the slightest hint, it will become very dangerous. As long as you are there nothing can ever happen to me! You are the best, father! Today is your first day in court! It will be your first case. And it won’t be easy... ...but don’t lose hope. Thanks father! Bye! Good morning sir! You seem to be in a very good mood today. Oh it’s been a bad morning today! I fought with my wife. An editor had come to write an article about our 35 years of togetherness. What will he write? Nonsense! If it wasn’t for Bendre’s songs, god knows how I would have survived! Sir! Who is Bendre? Is he the one who writes songs for films? Don’t you know who D.R. Bendre is? Film songs I believe! Don’t you have any interest in literature? Why were you born in Karnataka? We should take you to Antarctica and left you there along with my wife! What kind of a woman she is?! He started with his tantrums! He has come in such a bad mood today. God knows who is going to pay for it. What is this? Why is everyone looking at their mobiles? Huh... What was he doing then? There is no need for so much drama! Sit down! What was the need for so much build up? CASE NO. 8/19 Kempapura police station V/S Kamalesh Laud and others. Good morning, sir! I am Nandhini. I am the victim of this case. On special permission from the court... ...I am appearing on behalf of the prosecution. You have arrived after the Judge. Don’t you dare do this again, otherwise I’ll dismiss the case. My Lord, people who have no idea about the rules of the court just appear! Anyway... I don’t want to waste time and would like to come directly to the point. My clients have been stuck in the judicial custody for more than a week now. I’d request you to sanction their bail. Your Honour, why should they be given bail when they have gang raped a girl? Do you think of yourself as a lawyer or a judge? You are saying that they have raped you... Look here... ...you might be new to this legal system But that doesn’t mean I should tolerate your nonsense. What Shyam Prasad said is right! Yes the accused have been pressed with rape charges. But... ...the court will decide the fate of the case. My lord until they are proven guilty... ...don’t they have the right to live freely? They are not fleeing away from the country. When they are summoned to the court pertaining to this case... ...they will definitely come. Your Honour, they will try to destroy the evidences if they are let out. Or they might even try to attack me. You are saying the same thing again! Have you studied for law? Or have you watched some movie? I am sanctioning bail for these three accused. Court adjourned. You are a young woman! So what if you got raped? You are still alive and you are very beautiful... What more does a woman need? Money... Of course. Even that will be arranged. It’s good that you quit now. Are you trying to threaten me? I usually don’t give free advice to anyone. You should know when to use your intelligence and feelings. Understand that! [Singing…] Oh god! Can you please stop singing! It’s unbearable! You can’t bear to hear me sing... ...and I can’t bear to eat your food. I want to beat up the astrologer who told us that we were compatible on 36 grounds. When going the gets tough the tough gets going! Oh lord! Enough of your philosophical lecture! This case wasn’t taken seriously. But yes that was our plan! But now the situation is different. Oh god, the rapists have been let out. What if they find us? What if they threaten us? Or what if they attack us? Nobody will do anything to you for sure! We are all aware of what they did to Jagadish Uncle. They are very dangerous Nandu! We have laid the net for whales and not fishes! Risk, tension, and danger are inevitable. I wonder what their next move would be. Hey it’s her! Move the car. Bang the car! Don’t spare her. Go! Drive fast! Go fast! Go! Go! Go! Go! Reverse the car! Stop! Stop! Come back! She’s right there. Turn the car! The reason for me to come live on Facebook is that... ...those 3 accused are following me. They are trying to attack me. I’m on my way to the Gangothri Campus. Please come and help me! Please! Please! I’m still on live. Hey I told you not to mess with her! Just get home right now. Hey... Let’s leave soon! It was like watching a good action film. It was superb! Will you shut your mouth or shall I send you to jail along with them. What is all this Shyam Prasad? My Lord! My clients had gone to request her to withdraw charges for this false case. She has edited this piece of film and have projected my clients in bad light. Is it? What do I look like to you? I may look like a fool but I’m not! Inspector... ...take them back to the custody. Adjourned. What is my boss doing here? He was previously enquiring a case involving a husband and wife. I’m not able to gauge as to which case he is investigating about? This bald guy is also talking to him continuously. Why are you so restless? Do you want to go to the restroom? No boss! I’m too curious to know as to what you are doing? Kamalesh and his friends don’t even remember the rape. So there could be two possibilities. I understood boss! These boys might be going through short term memory loss inspired from the film Ghajini. Will you allow me to speak? Sorry boss! Please continue. One possibility is that... ...they have ruined so many girls’ lives that they don’t remember anything. -- Or else... -- Or else? This rape hasn’t taken place at all. How do you say that? Hmm... Just a possibility! Do one thing... ...keep an eye on Nandhini and her friends. And also appoint informers to stalk them. Why hasn’t the IO come today? Sir my boss has gotten busy with the investigation. Oh is it? Are we sitting here for some sort of fun? Maybe... Hey haven’t you given the notice to him? We’ve given sir! My Lord! Even he appears there is nothing to say! The case is unnecessarily getting dragged. The station head’s version has gotten recorded. The couple who has witnessed the incident has already signed. And finally the government doctor has also submitted the report. What else is left my lord? Nandhini has built a false case... ...and it’s a publicity stunt. That’s it. Nothing else. When a woman is proclaiming that she has been raped... ...how can that be considered a publicity stunt your honour? Why would I do that? My Lord! Even I respect women. But sorry to say this... ...of late women take undue advantage of the law. It could be to gain attention or sympathy... ...and can stoop to any level. Nandhini is also doing the same. You are character assassinating me! This is not good! Are you threatening me? I’m a lawyer and this is a court! Just like you filed a false case against those 3 innocent boys, you thought you could do the same to me? He is trying to provoke you! Be careful! Order! Order! What is this? How much will you keep fighting? Why am I here then? Nandhini’s medical report clearly indicates that it is negative. Hence I’m requesting you to dismiss this case. Are you alright? Sorry your honour! I’ve not eaten anything. I’m feeling very dizzy. With your permission can we proceed after lunch? By then IO will also arrive and we can record his statement as well. Court will commence after lunch. Why are you tensed sir? She is not as easy as I thought She is prepared for everything. I’m surprised that she has so much experience at such young age. Do you think she has someone who is backing her? What is this sir? That husband and wife walked in for a divorce. But you have asked them to reconcile? If it were anybody else... ...they would have made money out of it. True, you should earn money. But money is not everything. Every couple thinks of separation at one point. Humanity lies in between thinking and actioning it out. You should first win people’s heart. Shyam Prasad do you have any cross-examination? Yes my lord! From all the points you made... ...how are you absolutely sure that Kamalesh and his friends have abducted Nandhini? The car belongs to them. But there may be a possibility that they were not present in the car. I have presented 11 exhibits that prove that it is them only. Kamlesh’s hand tattoo, mobile location... ...the credit card that he had swiped. The evidences found at the location that they had raped, etc. etc. How many times will you repeat the same story? Court is not going to listen to your story. They go only by statements. Evidences and witnesses pertaining to the case. Evidences are exactly corresponding to the crime sequence, Shyam Prasad. What is the big deal in that sir? She has been saying her story her version and believes that is the truth. On Aug 8th we’ll need to also ask Kamalesh about his version of the story, right? I request you to kindly call him. Hey young boy please come! Why are you standing? Should I welcome you in a grand manner? Come! So Kamalesh... ...you are 26 years old right? Please tell everyone the truth as to what happened that night. Idiot... ...don’t you know that you need to keep your phone switched off? Sir your wife is calling! Since you didn’t receive the call she is calling me! Throw that phone away! Please start over. So on that night you all had called Mohini to your farmhouse? Yes sir! We had a clear mutual consent... Hey I understood. Just because I love my mother tongue... ...you thought I didn’t know English? You are wasting time talking in two languages. What does he do then? That night we partied with Mohini. And after sometime we fell unconscious. We woke up the next day evening at 4 pm. This is it sir! So that night after Mohini left... Kamalesh and his friends had fallen unconscious due to drinking. They left the farmhouse at 10, your honor. They purchased drinks. Kamalesh’s hand tattoo. The same car... ...swiping the credit card. It has all been captured on the CCTV camera. And they abducted me from the bus stop. They took me to a secluded place... ...and gangraped me. So were you so strong even when you got arrested on grounds of prostitution in London? Mind your words Mr. Shyam Prasad! Sir he is assassinating my character. What is this Shyam Prasad? Why you using such obscene language? Sorry My Lord! I just wanted her to know how it feels when she tarnishes others' character. She is repeatedly projecting Kamalesh and his friends as villains... ...and she is trying to be heroic. The truth is that she is the villain. There is no gangrape that has taken place. It is just cheap allegations. That’s it! You are the one who is throwing allegations at me. You are just trying to deviate from the topic! Sir! Your wife is calling again! Give it to me! Lord Hanuman... Please keep me unmarried at least in my next birth. [Chanting Slogan..] Shyam Sundar! Sir my name is Shyam Prasad! Whatever as long as you know that I’m calling you. My mood is spoilt now. I’ll take this up on Monday. Adjourned. Give me some water. Coming sir! Sir take the ‘piles’ that you were asking for? Idiot! It’s called ‘files’. Both are the same. Did you study the case? Of course sir! I’m thorough. The doctor had misconducted the surgery... ...and lead to extreme blood loss. Rangappa died. They fit an affair angle... ...and proved that it was a murder. Since it was time for village panchayat elections to gain political sympathy. Idiot which case are you talking about? Case no. 420/90. I’ll beat you up. I told you about the 402 case. Sorry sir. I interchanged the numbers by mistake in confusion. Ok so here is your ‘piles’. Dashmi Prakash D/O Jagadish Prakash. The father has fought for his daughter’s case. So... ...you’ve been doing all this for your Guru Jagadish Prakash. Sir... I’ve been wanting to meet your daughter for so long. You’ve just been delaying it for some reason. What to do? She keeps running around here and there. Why do you like her so much? I don’t know sir. She looks very sweet and cute. She gives me so much of joy when I look at her. When my mother met with an accident... ...my sister was only 4 months old then. Dashmi reminds me of my sister. She must have just looked like her. I’m so happy to see you. You are so cute. You must be wondering as to who I am, right? I am Nandhini. [Bandhana movie dialogue] You are so expressive. Will you be my friend? [Popular Kannada song] Ok... Now talk to me. I've been wanting to talk to you for so long, you know? [Popular Kannada song] Oh... enough of Dubsmash now! Why aren’t you talking to me? She can’t talk. She is dumb. That’s why she loves Dubsmash so much. She uses Dubsmash to communicate. That’s why I’ve been avoiding this. We’ll need to remove Nandhini from this case. Otherwise it’s going to be a problem. You were bragging so much about yourself the other day. Since your father was such a renowned lawyer... ...that is why I gave you the case. When you drive uphill... ...you will need to slow down the gear no matter which car it is. So you don’t need to change the goal. We just need to take another direction. The other day you were saying not everyone becomes a lawyer by wearing a black coat. Yes I did. I underestimated her. But she doesn’t seem like she is fighting a case for the first time. She seems prepared for everything. I could have created an alibi that your boys were not present at the crime scene. But they have given away the clues. So what do you mean? Are we going to lose this case? My son may have done anything but he is my son. If anything happens to him I won’t spare anyone. Why? Why are you getting excited for everything? There will be a way out! What else is left? You won’t be able to understand how a lawyer’s mind works. From your side... ...use your power to somehow get a new judge. We still have 3 days’ time for the court to resume. By then... ...just wait and watch how I will be giving a shock to Nandhini. You are just fit to eat and laze around. Ya right. From all the circumstantial evidences... ...it is clear that Kamalesh, Bunty, and Bhandari have committed this crime. Sorry to interrupt my lord. I have a complain against Nandhini Vardhan for attempt to murder and robbery. So with these charges we cannot proceed, my lord. What nonsense? On Saturday night when I was not at home... ...Nandhini had sneaked into my house. She has stolen money and jewellery worth 1 crore. ...and my security guard tried to stop her. She stabbed him with a knife. At 11 pm Nandhini’s car had arrived... ...and her mobile location has been traced at the crime scene. When she had stabbed the security guard... ...her fingerprints had been also traced. Nandhini’s car has been parked in the court premises. Both cash and jewellery are present in the car. You can verify the same, my lord. What is this Nandhini? Is this true? No, your honour. My car and mobile have been missing since Saturday night. Your answer doesn’t make any difference in the court, Ms. Nandhini Vardhan. Court needs proof and I have it with me. I did not commit this crime, your honour. Proof and evidences can be created as well. Exactly! That is my point. In order to get the truth... ...I just played a small trick on her. Yes... ...it’s true that she has not committed any crime. But I have all the evidence to prove that she has done it. But in this case she is doing the same thing. There is no record that I have committed the crime. But there are circumstantial evidences that prove that Kamalesh and his friends have committed the crime. And the same has been submitted to the court. And a thorough verification has also been conducted. But the faces of Kamalesh and his friends have not been seen at all. According to the given circumstantial evidences... Kamalesh, Bunty, and Bhandari may or may not have committed the crime. Correct! Look! The evidences have been verified in detail. There is a possibility that they have done the crime. But we cannot rule out that it may not have happened as well. We do not have that one strong evidence to prove that they have done the crime. Kindly look into this and grant the permission required. Tell me why you want to bring Mrs. Vimala Pathak to the court as a witness? What is this your honour? How can we allow a new witness at this point of time? There is no prior notice nor any kind of intimation given. What is this? If I had intimated the same in advance... ...they would have tried to destroy it. I request you to kindly grant permission for Mrs. Vimala Pathatk to appear as a witness to the case. No, my lord. There is nothing left in the case. Her true colours have come out. She is just wasting time. Definitely not, your honour. Dr. Vimala Pathak is a key witness to this case. Then you should have informed earlier. My Lord... ...please do not allow any witness at this point of time. Let us see Shyam Prasad. Any sort of truth can come out. There is no truth, my lord. When you see a woman you become weak. You are just nodding your head to whatever she is saying. What is the need to prolong a case which is likely to be acquitted? Mind your words! Don’t think I’m not aware of your cheap tricks. I know you want to provoke me... ...and get the reaction that you want. Just so you can have me removed from the case? These things won’t work with me. I am granting permission for Dr. Vimala Pathak to appear in the court tomorrow. Adjourned. Tell me sir. Shyam... Who is Vimala Pathak? She is a gynaecologist and a forensic doctor. For many cases she appears as a witness in the court. Good for her! So why is Nandhini calling her? Why would she call a gynaecologist, sir? To give a report on the rape. What report is she going to give? Why should she come? What is happening in the case? Relax sir! I just spoke to your son and his friends. They haven’t raped her. She has just fit them in a case in which the crime hasn’t taken place. She thinks that she is extremely intelligent. Let’s see for how long she will be able to continue. They acquit the case even when the actual rape has taken place. How will they convict anyone in a rape that hasn't taken place? No chance! You just relax! When he is high on drinks he doesn’t even know who his mother is. In that case how will he remember as to who he has raped? Did you contact Brahma? Sir, I’ve been trying to call him but he is not answering my call. Why do you keep wasting your time by coming here? This is surely not a waste of time sir. There are so many memories attached to this house. I cherish all of it. I wish I could get those days back in my life. You are mad. When the whole world believed that I had committed suicide... ...how did you know that I was actually murdered? You are not suicidal! You are a fighter. They destroyed the evidence in the case that you were fighting for. They murdered you and twisted the story that it was a suicide. They escaped from a crime that they did. But this time I will attach them to a crime that hasn’t happened. On August 8th... Nandhini had come to my clinic at around 1 am. She said she was gangraped... ...and she requested me to conduct a medical test. This is utter nonsense, my lord. You are a reputed gyno and forensic doctor. How did you lose your common sense by conducting a medical test without an FIR... ...knowing that it is not permissible in the court? Hold your tongue Mr. Shyam Prasad! I’ve been presenting forensic reports for the last 8 years. Even I understand the procedures that take place in the Court. I couldn’t refuse because Nandhini was in a miserable state. Her clothes were torn and she was wounded. She was scared that the accused will try to attack her again. So I had to perform my duty as a doctor. If the court does not want to look into my report... ...then I shall leave. No! No! Please tell me as to what had happened in detail. Again you are doing the same thing, my lord. You are agreeing to everything when a pretty woman speaks. If you permit her to be a witness I will strike and sit down. I will not allow whatever you feel like doing. What do you mean by not allow? You want to strike? Carry on! But this is my court. Go out and protest. If you want to walk out you may leave. Doctor please continue. After conducting the test at around 1:30 am... ...the observation report reads as follows. I found 12 wounds on her body. There were 3 different fingerprints on her body. There were crotch marks on her inner thigh. There was semen and blood stains on her clothes. And there was pubic hair on her private part. On Nandhini’s request... ...we had preserved all of this in the lab, your honour. So according to your report... ...it indicates that the gang rape has taken place. Possible. Who are these people, my lord? I think they have seen a good film and come to the court. No forensic doctor can confess that that the gang rape has taken place. And you just can’t say it. I think you’ve not paid attention to what I had said earlier. I said it was possible. I’ve not written that the gang rape has taken place. I have just written the medical observation. This is nothing but a pre-planned scheme, my lord. According to the procedure an FIR needs to be registered. The SHO or the Circle Inspector pertaining to the jurisdiction... ...should take them to a government hospital and get a medical test done. The hospital needs to then send the report to the forensic department. But Nandhini did not come to the hospital the next day. She chose to go only to this particular doctor, the previous night. And she is making her only read the report. My job is to only present reports if the victim has been raped or not. It is true that the court has not summoned me. Yet I’m here. If there is no value for justice... ...then I shall leave. C’mon doctor... ...stop saying that you will leave for everything. He wants to strike every time. And that girl’s face has become so small. This case is driving me nuts. Doctor... ...it’s been more than 5 months since you have conducted the test. How can you prove that it’s only these 3 boys who have committed the crime? I had preserved the semen, pubic hair, and the nail marks on the victim’s body, your honour. Based on that we can get the DNA samples. We can match with the accused DNA samples. This is master plan, your honour! Why can’t you understand this? I do understand. I order the DNA test to be conducted on the accused. And let’s see what comes up. Adjourned. Everything else is okay. But to fit a case in which the rape hasn’t taken place... ...it’s going to be very difficult. So we need a doctor who can give a fake report. We’ll need to skip the medical test that police will be in charge of. We can easily skip that medical test. But let’s not morph the medical report. We’ll fake the rape. What? How can you fake the rape? Can you help me find a doctor who is a gynaecologist as well as a forensic doctor? Sure but how does it help the case? I’ve seen forensic doctors appearing in the court and presenting the report. In order to make them believe about the gang rape... ...let’s fake everything that needs to be proved. Nandhu please think over it again. It’s a very big risk that you are undertaking. With that your name will get ruined in the eyes of the society. Jagadish sir is not one to commit suicide. Dashmi... ...the guilt keeps killing me from inside. My reputation doesn’t bother me when I think about them. Who is the masseuse who keeps visiting Kamalesh’s farmhouse? Yes. It’s Mohini. Will you help me meet her? Yes you were saying something? Please don’t test my patience. I can’t keep barking the same thing again and again. I will just say it once. Same pinch. Now we are on the right track... ...it’s time to talk about actual business. I’m sure 50 crores is nothing to you when it comes to your son. Money doesn’t matter to us. But you are setting our son’s future at such a high risk. Sir... ...you are just wasting your time by listening to him. Just listen to my plan. You will need to complain against the Judge... ...and have him removed from this case. If there is a Judge who will favour us... ...the case will be in our control then. Wow sir! You are brilliant. But do not take this case lightly. I’ll tell you as to what is going to happen in the court tomorrow. The DNA test and samples have been conducted on Kamalesh Leud, Kanti Kotwal, and Bhandari on 3 grounds. On Aug 8th... ...the test conducted on Nandhini Vardhan... ...had fingerprints, semen, pubic hair, and skin extract. They match the exact DNA of the accused conducted last week. According to the medical report... ...it confirms that these 3 accused have committed the gang rape on Nandhini Vardhan. No! No! If something like that happens... I will not spare you. It’s difficult to live life if you think only bad things are going to happen. But it’s always better to be prepared for the worst. Even we are quite well-versed with philosophies. Now let’s talk about work. Your boys have not committed any kind of rape on Nandhini. Tell us something new. Even we are aware of that. But do you know why she has fit a false allegation against these boys? I know the reason. But even if you know the reason there is nothing we can do about it. She has literally made it impossible to prove that it’s a false case. She has not spared any kind of clue or evidence. In order to prove that it is a false allegation... ...there are only two ways. One is... Parathasarathy Brahma. Two is... Parathasarathy Brahma. What are you going to do? How are you going to prove the same? That is my problem. Leave it to me. I’ll message you the account details. You arrange the money from your end. Now you can go sleep peacefully. Goodnight! Why have you asked me to come here sir? These water... ...streams. They look really beautiful... ...but they're equally dangerous. I thought it would resonate with your character. At such a young age you seem to be very intelligent. I’m really impressed. Car can break down for two reasons. One being the car must be an old one. And two being when someone cuts the wire on purpose. You’ve studied Kamalesh and his friends really well. You also have a detailed observation with respect to their whereabouts and lifestyle. Infact... ...you know exactly where Kamalesh’s tattoo has been imprinted. Very good. Mohini spikes their drinks even before they get there. At around 9:30 they get unconscious. Then your friends enter the farmhouse from the backside. They take their mobile, purse, and car key from them. They reach the wine shop. They order for some drinks. They swipe Kamalesh’s credit card. To avoid getting their faces captured on CCTV... ...they get their drinks to the car. He hands out the credit card on purpose... ...to get the tattoo captured. So the credit card factors to be one of the evidences... ...where you get abducted from the bus stop Then the couple helps you... ...and you specifically register your case in that police station. So that the case gets delayed. You have planned everything so well. And that too for a crime that hasn’t taken place. Prithivi Stephen Varada and his wife Rohini helped you. And of course your father also supported you. I know that you schemed all this only for Jagadish and his daughter. You sacrificed so much for their injustice. Was the crime so gruesome? That night... ...I had to leave for London to pursue my higher studies. I had researched on Dashmi’s ailment and found a doctor who could fix the problem. I had booked an appointment too. We planned to go to the same ice cream parlour to celebrate that moment. I was waiting for Dashmi for a long time. But when she was on her way... Kamalesh and his friends had attacked her. Dashmi is very scared of injection. They had injected several times... ...and gangraped her. Die They threw her in some remote place... Jagdish sir searched for her everywhere. If I hadn’t called her to the ice cream parlour... ...this wouldn’t have happened The guilt kills me from inside. We found her body only after a day. She then died in the ICU. Kamalesh and his friends wanted to rape a 10-year old girl in a gym But Dashmi saved that girl. They wanted to teach Dashmi a lesson to satisfy their ego. We found her body only after a day. When I learned about the incident in London... ...my anger and guilt loomed so much. Jagadish sir didn’t want to let it go. He filed a case against them. He fought for his daughter. But they tampered all the evidences. He still did not give up. He appealed to the High Court to teach them a lesson. But they murdered him and made it look like a suicide. When a crime takes place... ...if the evidences are not strong enough the case falls flat. You wanted to fit them into a case where the crime has not taken place... ...with the help of substantial evidence. What else could I have done? I could just take a gun and kill them in minutes. But Jagadish sir always believed in the law system. Which is why I wanted to fight it legally. I manipulated the evidence for a crime that did not take place. I took help from friends Prithivi Stephen and Varada. After Kamalesh, Bunty, and Bhandari fell unconscious... I asked them to disguise themselves... ...and plant evidences. I had asked them to plan this whole thing where their faces are not revealed at all. This time nobody can escape from this. I already knew about your plan. But I didn’t have any witness to that. Now that you explained in detail... ...I’ve recorded everything. This is enough to expose the truth in the court. I thought you were the only person who I could trust... ...but I feel betrayed now. Please give me that proof. Do you think you are the only person who is intelligent? Why are you doing this sir? Don’t you have sympathy for a girl who went through so much? I’m not interested in your nonsensical philosophy. I’m going to become a millionaire only because of you. Thank you so much. I didn’t know that the crime branch officer would betray us like this. According to 201 for destruction of evidence... ...I thought the case would become stronger. But Brahma spoilt it all. We decided not to use this. But there is no other way out. Give it to me. No. I knew this would defame your reputation. I’m also aware that you will not get married because of this. But I didn’t care. People even think to even donate blood in today’s world. Your sacrifice is magnanimous. I’m not able to bear to see your life being ruined. No father in this world would have supported me like you did. This is my battle. I’ll need to do this myself. A big plot has been schemed, my lord. We have come across cases where the crime has taken place... ...but there is no strong evidence proving the same. But for the first time... ...a crime which hasn’t taken place, She has fit evidences in such a way that they can get convicted. Tell us the truth that you found out in this case. My lord... This matter has not been presented before the court till now. The allegations that Nandhini has made against Kamalesh, Kanti, and Bhandari are... Absolutely... True without a doubt. It is true that the gangrape has taken place... ...and these 3 are the ones who have done it. Are you backstabbing now? Just see what I’ll do to you. Shut up! How can your clients speak in such an indecent manner? Sorry sir! Mr. Brahma have you changed parties too? You are also judging like Nandhini. Who am I to give any kind of judgement? I have come here to submit the missing evidences in my investigation to the court. Court will have its own procedures. You can’t do all this now. You can go back. Who are you to say that? Am I not here for that? Mr. Brahma... ...can you please elaborate on the missing evidences in your investigation? Everyone is plotting a scheme against them. The truth is that the gang rape hasn’t taken place at all. Nandhini was a student of Mr. Jagadish Prakash. There are charges on my clients that they have gangraped his daughter and murdered him. Since the case fell flat... ...now she is accusing them in a false case. How can there be some false case? What we need is enough proof and witnesses. If the same matches then conviction takes place. If it does not match then the case gets acquitted. Stop making some stories. Brahma you please tell us. My lord... Before the gangrape took place... ...Kamalesh and his friends used to go to a particular medical shop. And purchase Rohypnol. It’s a sedative. They used to inject it in many girls and rape them. And this is not the first time. In a span of 6 months... ...they have purchased this drug 17 times from the same medical shop. The traces of this drug was found in Nandhini’s medical report. When Nandhini returned home that night... ...they kidnapped her again. They bathed forcefully. They burnt her clothes. They made sure there are no clues or evidences. Footage from the medical shop. Them following the car. The clothes that were burnt in the farmhouse. Mobile location corresponding to the crime scene. I have collected all the pertaining evidences. After verifying the report... ...the court will resume post lunch. Sir! I did not expect this. I had to pretend that I was part of their plan. Otherwise they would have had me removed from the case. Thank you so much sir! I supported you because the intent was noble. Good luck for the judgement. Case no 8/19 Kempapura police station vs Kamalesh Lad and others. Arguments I don’t have any arguments, my lord. Because it seems like you have a biased point of view. The night when the incident took place... ...she has gone only to Vimala Pathak to get her medical test done. But she doesn’t go to the government hospital the next day to get the test done. She has got the test done with the doctor who favours her... ...and brings the same doctor as a witness in the court. You are not able to see this point at all. I’m aware of what your judgement is going to be like today. Hence I would like to take this up at the High Court. Please go ahead. Nandhini can you please tell us your final argument? It’s true that my father has brought me up in an unconventional way. I was in London for 2 years. I dress in modern attires. I’ve been to pubs... ...and very rarely I drink too. If a girl does the above things... ...does that mean she is ready to have sex? This is the society’s point of view. Lust is okay. But how do they have the right to rape like monsters, your honour? This fight is just not applicable for me. Just like me there are other victims. Some may be reticent to even say this. They get scared to even complain. We need a judgement that will give courage our woman to be strong. A judgement that will scare these boys to even look at them in a disrespectful manner. I am expecting a judgement like this, your honour. I do not have experience in law. This is my first case. But... ...I understand the pain of a girl who is gang raped in this society. I know how her feelings are scarred for a lifetime. How can we let go of these accused who snatch their lives? This case is not just about 376 D. According to the law of amendment of 2013... ...under 376 E. I would like them to be hanged to death. It is impossible to scan the truth or lies from one point of view. The court gives the judgement based on witnesses and evidences. There were two sides of the argument. One being that the accused have raped Nandhini... ...and the other one being that the incident hasn’t happened at all. But going by the evidences and witnesses verified in this case... It is proven that Kamalesh Leud, Kanti Kotwal, and Bhandari, have gang raped Nandhini. Gang rape that falls under IPC 376 D... They have tried to kill Nandhini... ...and destroy evidences pertaining to the case. In order to teach them a lesson to not commit such crime against any woman...
