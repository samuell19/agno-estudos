Encoded By "Pirata-Tuga" ...TuGAZx... Enjoy it! How about I drive? There we go. - It's all about time you showed up. So~me couples like to talk. - And did they see anything? They don't know the girls, they didn't see the car, nothing. How many more miles do we have left here? - We need to check theses 2 roads... and circle back around. Harris wants us back to base by midnight. Maybe the perimeter's not wide enough. Maybe this guy's a traveller. Maybe... the first body is throwing us off. Your turn. New paint, new plates. It's our guy. He's here. Shit! Back in the car. Let him think we are leaving. We'll get tactical out here. All units! This is Predator 5 requesting back up. We're on Stone Hollow Road. We have the unsubs's vehicle. They're still alive. - Come on! FBI! Check the girls. Sara! Talk to me, Sara! Predator 5 to base! Over! We have the situation secure. Repeat: Situation is secure. Suspect is dead. So are the girls. There were 3 shots fired. Sara! Sara! Drop! You're in the line! Get down! Get down! Drop! Man! I thought you guys were never gonna get here. Hey, Harris, I'm fucking starving! Tomorrow, I have a senior staff meeting with the director, a Q4 performance review, and an academy course to prep. But now, instead I get to waste my whole day at your funerals. Special Agent Moore, when is the situation secure? On the drive home. - That's right, on the drive home. Sir... - Shut up! Cigarettes on the table, more at the door, different brands. 2 cars out front. 4 place settings, not 3. All should have alerted you that there might be another suspect. I think... - Sorry? What? What did you say? - I think you enjoy... watching us fail, Sir. - Better in here than out there. You know this really happened? The unsub was apprehended in under 2 minutes, without a shot fired. It took you guys 7 minutes. And you killed your partner. Have some cake. The majority of murders are co~mmitted by someone known to the victim. Those that are not solved within 48 hours seldom are. Not so with serial killers. One advantage is knowing that as long as the unsub is out there, you'll always have another chance. With each new killing comes a resetting... ofthe clock. Time is on your side. The model for this exercise was a missing person search in Buffalo 1982. The dead man was an accomplice who was killed the day before. The killer staged a suicide in order to try and effect an escape. As you can see, some ofyou responded better than others. How many times has a profiler been in a kill or capture situation... since 1982? - You're think I'm preparing you... for something you may never experience? Success comes when you understand... that your most lethal weapon isn't your firear~m, but your brain. A lot ofthe old guard here don't believe in my methods. A lot ofthem think I'm crazy. You're a privileged group! You're all smart or you wouldn't be here. I want you to be smarter! Our final exercise will be on the island of Oneiga. The simulation will be a test primarily ofyour teamwork. I hope you're ready. - Then how could we have saved... the girls at the old hotel? - You couldn't. They were dead. I don't understand the point ifwe couldn't have saved them. The point is to get used to it. Good evening, my fine young FBI friends. I am a pretty little thing... just out of Lit class at GMU. Please note the Jimmy Joyce... in my Kate Spade. My parents are loaded, as per my expensive ensemble. And that J - where is it? - on my key ring means I'm either a Jill or a Jennifer. Those being the favourite J-names of Beltway parents since circa 1981 . I like to hang around with my girlfriends and have a good time. But I'm reallyjust a mature wo~man Looking for a mature man. And I recently quit smoking. Why'd you say that? - You see how she's eyeing the guy there? It's not him. It's his cigarette. - Spoken like a woman who knows. How long has it been, Nicole, 3 days? - The lovely Nicole and her demons. I'm surprised there's enough room at the table for all of us. 5 minutes to get her number. - It'll take me 2. You're on. The money's coming out. 20. - 20 works. Big money. Hi! I think I know you, don't l? You're... Jill, right? - Jen. Jen, yes! Of course! Obviously you don't remember me. My name is Bobby Whitman. Rafe, you're up. Profile. - Okay. Black suit, blonde hair, Martini. I'm the sophisticated type... on the prowl for pretty young things. Preferably blonde. Preferably a cheerleader with great big... No, you've got to be kidding me! You're right about the blonde. - I think you're projecting. I don't know. It was like 2 seconds at a lecture last semester. GMU, Lit department, right? - The Moody lecture? Yes, Moody. Heck of a writer! I'm actually not even a student myself. I work in finance. - Finance? Oh, right, Bobby! - Hi, how are you? I'm good. - He's got 15 seconds. Thank you. - It looks like tonight wasn't your night. Her name's Jen. I told her to play along. - You're full of shit! You never know. So what is going on in that head? We're professionals. We shouldn't have to put up with Harris' shit. Alright, what's up? I'm not making profiler. I was alone in his office. His recommends were on his desk and I read them. We have the weekend at Oneiga. - He says I'm unfocused... and not capable ofthe psychological co~mmitment necessary for profiling work. How do you like that? Commitment. I mean, fucking look at me, man. Vince, I think maybe you're... - You're not making profiler either! Sorry. I read it. Don't work too hard out there, okay? We've got a late addition. This is Detective Gabe Jenson. He's from the Philadelphia PD. - Good morning. How you doing? He's a resident profiler. Somehow he convinced the Attorney General... that he could sit in on some exercises and see how I work. Do I have the politics about right? - Something like that. He's joining the team? - He'll observe, not participate. Now be nice to him or it's my ass. No offence, Detective. None taken. You want to do a hostage rescue or smallpox outbreak, this is the place. The Navy Seals built it for war game practice, but once a year... they turn it over to me for the weekend. Okay, get your rappelling lines out ofthe back and prepare to drop. It's a joke. Here we are. Crime Town, USA. Where all the residents are dead, or about to be. Now, the idea here, people, is to only kill the bad guys. Well, nobody's perfect. - Nice to hear you say that, Sir. It's like Beirut meets Belfast. - Sir, I thought they didn't... let foreign nationals in the FBl. - On the inside, Rafe, he's 100% American. As American as the death penalty. - That's my boy. I think I'm in love. Oh, there is one other person. They'll becoming a long shortly. Who's that? - He's called "the puppeteer". He's killed 2 people on these streets and he's about to kill a third. Tomorrow morning, you'll find the crime Scene and receive the background dossiers. By 0800 on Monday, I want a full profile ofthis suspect. I want to know who he is, what he does and where he'll do it next. I'm asking special agent Reston to be team leader. Unless you'd like to defer. No, Harris. I will solve whatever sick, twisted crime scenario... you come up with. What's the tank for? - The Navy uses it... to simulate Arctic regions. That's what the nitrogen's for. In general, if it says "~military", don't touch it. Great. Navy humour. The computers are loaded with VICAP. But they're fully firewalled, so don't do any research off-site. lfyou want to do any blood samples on the autorad, analyse fibers, scout samples, it's all here. You'll rest up here until the morning. Downstairs is a fully stocked freezer, bunks and your showers. Don't forget you're 50 miles offshore, so if you run out of toilet paper, you are shit out of luck. So what's the point? - Sorry, Detective? The island, the middle of nowhere, they're all professionals. What's the point? The point is that they're isolated, alone and forgotten. That's what it's like to be inside the mind of a sociopath. Have you noticed it's a really bad feeling here? Good luck on your profile! Go! What? He said: "Dress for an island". So, Detective? What exactly did you do to earn this island paradise? Recommended for it, same as you. - Why, though? Did you catch... some killer in Philly or something? - You don't want to know... my war stories. - Actually I do. What do we know about you for real? He's got resentments toward his parents as per the amount on tattoos he's got there. He's just out of a bad relationship. He has barely looked at me and Sara. Maybe you're not my type, Nicole. We're alone on an island. Trust me, I'm your type! We also know he watches his words So that crossword's either a sign... of honing a talent or correcting a deficiency. What you say doesn't tell you about me, it tells me about you. I could say your gambling ~means you have an addictive personality. I could say I know you're sleeping with one ofthe guys in this room. I could say you take charge ofyour team because you never had a leader... in your own life. And you: When push comes to shove, you crack under pressure. Your partners can't depend on you. You don't belong here. But that's all surface. Psychological bullshit. That's not who you are. All for killing him in his sleep? Bad for you! A minute, 45. - Damn! You push me in, I'll have your badge. I came out here to feed the ducks. I see you're feeding the ducks. Maybe we could feed the ducks together. Leave you alone? - No, it's alright. I don't smoke. - I know. It's a gesture. Goodwill, sympathy. You know, the usual. In lieu of knowing what's going on. He's not gonna let me make profiler. He thinks I can't get past it. - Is he right? When I was a kid, I lost both my parents. A freak thing. 10 years old, bang! Mortality. So I grew up living real hard. Racing cars, smoking, drinking, Sleeping with any girl I could find. A real stupid dangerous lifestyle. Then I turned 11 and... But all I know is this: You don't confront your demons and defeat them. You confront them, then you confront them. Then you confront them some more. Every single day. You are totally fucked up, you know that? - You know what I hate about you? What? You only want me for my mind. What happened? I'd like to know how Harris got it here. I'd say the issue is "why". Here kitty, kitty. What kind of simulation is this? 10 o'clock. That's supposed to mean something? So what is this? It's supposed to be some kind ofwarning sign? Well, if I know Harris, it's a sign of something. It's 9:30 a.m. Saturday morning. We're in search of an unknown crime scene. We'll split into pairs. The first one who finds it, wins my eternal love and devotion. - And a dead cat. Now, this place must remind you of home. Happy Town, USA. Look! It's little Bobby. Little Bobby's gonna grow up... to be big and strong and pursue a career in buried children... and dismembered mommies. Now that will make Happy Town proud. I think you're in the wrong line ofwork. No, mate. Not me. Hey! Dinner at Harris' house. Pass the nuts. Charming. Great, a cigarette machine! Temptation is everywhere. Agent! We searching together or what? - Suit yourself. I'm on vacation. Hey, Vince! Check out the other side oftown. Yeah, yeah. Hey, everybody! Harris, you're one sick son of a bitch. Stay on my six. Okay, everybody. It's about that time to look alive. We have... a victim. Or victims. We've got a single victim. Caucasian female, 25, 26. For a puppeteer, that's a hell of a signature. Why don't you check the employee logs, receipts. See who shopped here, who worked here, that sort ofthing. - Let me run forensic, work the ti~meline. - Sara, why don't you check the carcass? Sara? - Sure. There's splatter behind the counter. The girl was definitely moved. Any venture as to weapon? - Nic, you want to take point an M.O.? Absolutely. - Not to step on your toes... but I'm gonna bet the guy's a trophy taker. What are you smiling about? - lf the taxpayers only knew. I think I'll go see ifthe unsub is still in the building. Sweetheart, it's just a simulation, yeah? - Where we're from, a site search is called procedure, yeah? We should have been allowed to bring our guns. It doesn't feel real without my gun. - How real do you want it? Don't move! Don't move! Sara. Let's see what freak show Harris has in mind, here. It's not fun unless it's a challenge, right? Move! My legs! No, don't touch it! - Help! They're frozen! - Help him! Stop it! This is a joke, right? It's just a simulation. I'm sorry, Nic. Were they working before? - No signal, nothing. What if it was some kind of accident? - Someone killed J.D! Don't get it? Someone is hereon this island! That wasn't there last night either. 12 o'clock. That's an hour and a half. - It's a message. What about the boat? We saw that pier with the boat when we flew in. Watch your backs and everyone else's! Hit the boat, find the radio! The simulation is over! Now is not the time for fear, people. Now is the time... Shit! Sara! Sara! Get out ofthe water! Help me get her out ofthe water! Get her out ofthe water! It's okay. You're okay. I'll handle it. - I got her. Back the fuck off! I'll handle it! You're out ofthe water, alright? You're out. Alright. You're out ofthe water. You're okay. - What's her thing with the water? I think I lost my smokes. Harris brought us to this island. Now we're not allowed to leave. Yes, let's talk about this Harris. Harris wouldn't do this. Say what you want but Harris is a company man. Did anyone actually see him get back in that chopper? Tell me somebody witnessed that. - Maybe he got tired ofthe simulations. Maybe he missed the taste ofthe real thing. I'll give him a taste ofthe real thing. - Did he just pull that gun... out of his ass? - We weren't supposed to bring weapons! My gun goes where I go. lfyou ever get shot sometime, ~maybe you'll understand. - You shouldn't have brought your weapon! You're gonna be glad I did! Two square miles at most. - Hey, check this out! Who wants to play some hide and seek? lf anyone else is on this island, Harris or worse, we're gonna find him. How's about your Navy, then? They don't muck around, do they? Damn cats! Oh, for the love of God, just take the arm! There. That's the Lucas I know. He'd want to get up and do it all over again. Are you alright? - I told you I'm fine. I know, but... - Don't ask constantly, then I'm alright. So can I ask you something else then? - Anything else. Well, since the end may be near: Have you kind of always sort of had a thing for me? Is that a no? 20 minutes to 12. So at 12 o'clock, someone else is killed. Somebody left those watches. - And left them after Harris had gone. We searched the island! - Somebody set that trap. Somebody rigged that boat. - So what are we saying? Are we saying this is some kind of game? - Eenie, meenie, minie, moe... who's the next motherfucker to go? It's 12 o'clock. It's 12 o'clock and we're still here! We're still here and it's 12 o'clock. - Shut up, Vince! Alright, look. We know that there is a killer on the island. Someone who knows what we're here for. Someone who knows where we'd be. There's just one problem. There's no one on the island but us. Now, hold on. Real slow, real easy. Let's all move our hands away from our weapons. You get on the ground! I'm checking the rooms, I find this by his bed. It's maps ofthe island, the building, everything here. Been doing some research on the place? - I can goddamn explain! This is a military facility. No one has access to this stuff! You got me... all wrong. Yeah, Detective? They're your maps? I want to see your hands up! Up! - You believe me? No one leaves this room! - Since when is this room save? Since we're all in it. On your knees now! Now! Down! Sara, can you feel your face? Because I can't feel your face. Coffee! There's something in the coffee. Hey, Nic. - Stay away from... Have to... stay awake. Going somewhere? Co~me here! Sit down! - I can explain! Shut up! - Listen... I said shut up! - You don't know what you're doing! You don't know who I a~m. - I know you killed J.D! Is everybody alright? - Sara! Sara! Hey, Sara! I just had the worst dream ever. Come on. Look. If I'm the killer, why didn't I run? You're all lying here. How come so am I? Maybe it's a trick so you can finish what you started. I tell you why the ~maps were in the bag. - No! You tell us... what you put in the coffee! - Hey! Who made it? Did I make the coffee? Sherlock Holmes over there made it! The man is calling you a killer! You might want to defend yourself! There's no blood. Somebody drained his blood. 6 o'clock. - Two watches. Two watches means two victims? We've got 20 ~minutes. Alright. I want to know what the next trap is, and I want to know now! I don't know! - You've been lying to us from the start. That doesn't make me the killer! - The dead people does. How about the loner mentality? How about the issues with the FBI? I'm not a cop. I'm an investigator with the Department ofJustice. I was sent... to investigate Harris. The Attorney General heard rumours about his methods. There was talk he was pushing trainees too far. The FBI investigates the FBI? - Not ifyou want it done right. They took him out ofthe field for a reason, didn't they? They sent me to see how he works you. The maps were prep. It's a job! You want to hook me up to a polygraph? We know how to beat polygraphs, too. He's lying. Watch his eyes. - I'm not lying. I just don't like you. Okay, you've got 15 minutes. You either tell us where the trap is, or you never leave this room! Don't take your eyes off him. Ok. It's a 9 number sequence repeating itself. 9 per mutations. What, a code? A combination? It has something to do with time. He has an obsession with time. - We need to find the trap! The numbers are the message. What if it tells us where the trap might be? You want to work the numbers? Fine. Bobby, help her. I'm searching the building. I'm searching with you. 10 minutes. Phone numbers, Social Security numbers, coordinates. Talk to me! 7 minutes. Between you and me. I'm not a violent person. The thing I've learned in my life is this: Sometimes ifyou find yourself... Feeling deep anger and frustration about where you find yourself, what has happened to you, the healthy thing to do... is to find an outlet and let it all fucking go. At 6 o'clock, if one of us dies, my outlet is you. I'm not your guy. You don't want to do this, man. You'll have to live with what you don't know. I think we're clear on this level. - The obsession is time. I know it! 582, 997, 924. What is it? 829, 979, 245. What is that? Sara! - 299, 79... It's a number! It's a fucking nu~mber! They're all just fucking numbers! 792, 458, 279. Anybody? Anyone? - What about a rate? When you factor in time, an amount becomes a rate? Or a speed? - What speed do you measure in millions? Atoms? Electrons? How should I know? - Light. 299 Millionen... 299,729,485 meters per second. This is the original measurement for light! And you know that? - It's a basic principle of physics. Along with "shit happens"? - Turn them off. Turn the lights off! What if that's the trap? - It's about the light. What is that? - What? The back of your coat. It's on yours, too. He's marked us. Letters. It's like a powder, put on us while we slept. A, O, R, T. Tora, Rota, Roat... Troa. - First it's numbers, now it's letters. It's 6. It just turned 6. Hey, who's out there? Anybody hear me? You're a dead man. Hey, guys! Down here! Vince! Vince, listen to me! We've got to shut offthe power. Fuck you! It's your trap! - Yeah, I'm so clever I'm killing myself! There's circuit breakers in the storeroom. Can you reach it? Look, I can, but you've got to give me your gun. I ain't giving you shit! - Are you gonna hang on forever? I'm gonna watch you die! - Watch me die and then what? Come on! Please! Throw it! I'm losing my grip! Stairs! I'm losing my grip! Come on, Gabe! Come on! Vince, what's happening in there? - Stay out ofthe water! Where's the cop? Vince! Lights out! I'm alive. - What's going on? I'm alive! Yes! You okay? - I'm alive! I'm alive! He saved my life, Lucas. Still think you know me, Agent? Still think you know who I am? Alright. How do we turn offthe water? Look, whoever did this really knows his engineering! Remotes, timers, they teach this in first year with siege tactics. But to set this up this fast, you've got to really know what you're doing. Pressure plates, radio detonators, it's all private sector sold, but the wiring is the tricky part. People take specialty courses in this sort ofthing for years. Right. Thank you. - You can all go to hell! Booby! Look at me! Look at me! 2 watches, 2 traps. Son of a bitch! So how about me? Is it my fucking turn? Right here! Right now! Who fucking was it? It was you who said to turn offthe water. Yes. Whatever makes you feel better. Sara? I don't think any of us should be alone right now. Ok? Nic found another watch. We've got an hour and a half. So what's with the jackets? lf it's a message, what's the order? The order we're dying in? J.D., Rafe, Bobby. Which letters were theirs? - The traps could have killed any one. How about the order we signed up with the Bureau? Who had seniority? J.D., then Bobby. - Then me. And me. - Cro... a... ton. Croton. Crotoan, Croato, Croato... Might as well pick them at random. - Croatoan! Like the island. The colony. Do you know where we are? Near the outer banks of North Carolina. It's one of the first sites settled by the Europeans in the New World. In the 16th century, there was a ship of settlers that landed right around here. Sent to colonize the place for England. They built their town on Roanoke lsland. Over 100 people. 2 years later, a supply ship sailed in. Only to find that... The colony had vanished without a trace. No bodies, no papers, no evidence of anything. Over 100 people... gone. The only thing left was a single word found carved in a tree: Croatoan. What was Croatoan? - Some said a body of water. Others said an Indian tribe. The point is that 500 years later... We still don't know where those people have gone. That's the message. An island full of people vanishes forever. And it happened here. - The killer isn't after the FBI. He's after infamy. It troubles me that you know this story. It'd trouble you more if I didn't. Alright. We know method, we know motive. All that's missing now... is where he made his mistake. I got something. We've got blood, under Rafe's nails. He must have struggled with the killer. We'll run it past the autorad. What are you staring at? - Time. Somebody know how this works? - I do. We can have a DNA match... in under an hour. - We've only got less than an hour. We'll need blood comparisons from each of us. Has anyone a problem with that? God, I want a cigarette. - You and me both. Aren't you a gambling man, Lucas? Who would you put your money on, now? It would not go anywhere different. - Who just about died down here? You didn't know you'd be down there. What do you do? Not help Vince? We're gonna trust you, then? - I'll trust you when you're dead. Let me enlighten you. lfyou know there's a bomb on a boat, you don't run toward it first in line. - I don't. Maybe you do. - Enough! Guns on the table. Everybody! I'm not giving up my gun. - I think I speak for the group when I say that would be bad. - I don't go anywhere without my gun. I'll give you my wheels first. I'll give up my chair. I'm not giving up my gun. - You got it. Hit the damn thing! Hit it! On the ground. - Nic, wait. It's not me! It's a mistake! - On the ground, goddamn it! I will waste you, Sara! - You want to kill me? The situation's secure. - That's what Harris says, right? The situation is secure on the drive home! Lower your weapon, Agent. Lucas. Lucas. It's not me, Lucas. Tell them. It's not me. - It don't makes sense. Why her? Because she wasn't gonna make it. She wasn't gonna make profiler. I saw the recommends myself. Neither were you, Vince. But I never had someone in my family get murdered. No kid sister of mine ever got drowned and raped, drowned and raped, over and over and over. Who knows what that would do on my head. You don't know. - The FBI didn't save your sister, Sara. And they didn't catch her killer. So why should they be able to catch you, when you're so much smarter... than everyone? I swear... it's not me. It's not me. She wouldn't. Not Sara. - So, she planned it for the island. She wanted us dead and under water, so we'd suffer. Ever see the pictures? Fucking brutal. I swear on my life, it's not me. We can stay in here and debate. But there's 10 minutes until the trap. What is the trap? Where is the trap? - I don't know. What is the trap, Sara? You tell me. - No, you tell me! What if she's telling the truth, Nic? Think about it. This is what the killer wants. Suspecting each other, fighting each other. This is what makes it fun. You're in the killer's mind again? We were all knocked out. He could have taken blood from any of us. You could have taken the blood. - I'll take blood from you! Nicole. Nobody else is gonna get killed. - You want to protect her? She's been playing you from the start, Lucas! You come after me, I will shoot you on sight. Nicole, we need to stay together. lf I'm by myself, I know who to trust. You go out there... - Bang! You go out that door, you don't come back in. Why would l? Do yourjob. Put a bullet in her. Sara, put yourself in our position: You have a prime suspect. There are still lives at risk. What do you do? I don't fit the profile. - Wouldn't you know what not to fit? You say I killed for revenge from my personal pain. That's not this killer. This killer is impersonal. Deadlines. Rules. They're ways to prove superiority. She's right, Gabe. - You know what else is right? They don't let killers in the FBI. Playing hurt, Playing wounded. Maybe that's her skill. We all have skills. I say where there's a skill, there's a weakness. We all have skills. Wait. We've been assuming that the deaths have been random, that anybody could walk into any trap. But look at the traps! J.D. dies because he was out front leading us. He was always out front. And Rafe? Rafe's a coffee junkie! Bobby? Who we go to get something to work? Who's our Mr. Fix it? - You're saying he knew who died when? Knew it, planned it through our characteristics, our skills, our weaknesses. All this time, the killer's been profiling us. Vince, what makes you different from the rest of us? I don't know. I mean, I know history. I do mazes. I'm in a goddamn chair! - Lucas, how does he kill you? Think. I'm our best shooter, our best driver. - And your weaknesses? l... say I'm fearless and I'm not! That leaves you, Sara. My sister was murdered. I haven't been in the water since. I see her there. That's his signature! Oh, my God. Nicole! Nicole! Jesus! No! She found herself some cigarettes. - They were laced with some type of acid. It's not her, Vince. - Why? She figured out the pattern! - She saves herself. Wouldn't you? I don't trust her. I don't trust any of you. - lsland fever! You got it, he's got it, she's got it. We're gonna ride it out nice and friendly until somebody finds another motherfucking watch. Are you having fun yet? - I'~m having fun. Harris! He's been watching us all along. Did he know you were from Justice? What if he knew he was being watched? No way! What if he knew they were gonna take away his program? I'm letting her go, Vince! Too bad! You won't get a chance to graduate. You're all so weak, pathetic, powerless. - You said you searched the island! We did, every corner! - You'll never be in control, no matter how hard you try. - Alright. He's out there. Who's with me? Out there? This is a fucking trap! What do you mean, "who's with you"? I'll tell you who's with you. I'm with you! Are you having fun yet? I'm having fun. You're all going out there? Look, I'm not going anywhere! You're right. You stay put. - What the fuck? What are you doing? Hide. Don't tell me where. Don't tell him where. Just do it until Monday. It's for the best. My fucking gun's empty! Is this real enough for you? You can't escape it. You can't stop it. You can't turn it off. We can do this all night long. We have all the time in the world. Still think you are better than me? Still think that the pupil could best the teacher? Is this what you wanted? Is this what you expected? Is this real enough for you? You're all so weak, pathetic. Too bad, you won't get a chance to graduate. You always lose. You see yourselfthe way I see you: afraid, powerless. Let me tell you what I think. You look like you're having fun. I'm having fun. I don't want the fun to end. I think they'll find you. I don't want the fun to end. Because I trained them. You think you're smarter than the rest of them? Let me tell you what I think. I think you don't stand a chance. You don't know who you're dealing with, do you? Come on. Finish it. Finish it, you selfish child. Come on! He never left, he stayed to watch. - And the killer knew. He's wearing watches. 3 watches. What time are they set for? They're set for now. Shut it off! lf it wasn't him... No wait! - It's a clever story. Sent to spy on the program, spy on Harris. - You're the one who's telling stories. I know it's not me. - And I know it's not me. It's not the three of us. Who's left over? - It leaves the last man standing. Jesus Christ, Sara! Watch out! - Watch out for fucking who? Stop shooting! Stop shooting! Sara! Stay right where you are! That's the price you pay for being fearless. Sara. Close, goddamn it! Who wants offthis island? You! Never anywhere without a gun. Back on schedule. I guess we have answers now, don't we, Sara? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? - You gonna panic now, Sara? You gonna panic when you've been so cool? What are you trying to prove? - What am I trying to prove? How does a fucked up girl like you get into the FBI, anyway? How did I get in? How did I get in? Did you not get in, Gabe? Did you try and they turned you away? What'd they tell you? You're not sharp enough, smart enough, sane enough? Panic. Watch her panic. - Get your hands up. Show me your hands! Boo! You call yourself a profiler? Show me your hands! - I'm the profiler! I want to see your hands! You're the victim! Watch your head. Thank God. I thought... Bullet-proofvest. I just need a little R and R. Surf and sand. Stay still. You just stay still. You think... they're ever gonna believe us? They won't have to. We can prove it. After Bobby died, I changed the clock back 15 minutes. What are you talking about? - What did Harris always tell us? Know the mind and anticipate. The killer was into deadlines. Precision, timing. So I set that clock 15 minutes back. - That clock? Oh, yeah. He wanted us to know exactly when he was going to strike. He wanted to watch us squirm as precious seconds were ticking away. It's all part of his fun. - His weakness. I was betting he'd change it back. I was right. But how are you going to prove it was Gabe who changed it back? Remember the phosphorescent powder from the jackets? That's what I put on the clock. It was my turn to set a trap. - So when he touched it... His hands are going to glow. Watch. This is awkward. You know... all these things, they work pretty good, you know? Timers, triggers, remotes. But at the end of the day, building a better mouse trap is just pure mechanics. It's knowing how to bait a particular mouse, that's the fun part. So there I was sitting next to the bodies of my parents... just waiting for someone to ask me why I killed them. And this detective comes up to me. And he says: "Want some gum?" Gum. No one asks. It never even occurs to them. And like after every first high, it's harder and harder... to get to that place. Until finally you get so good... there's no feeling at all. It's easy... Finding a worthy prey. A challenge, that's hard. You joined the FBI for this? - Yes. Yes. So while you were studying tired old hacks like Bundy, Gacy and Dahmer, I was studying you. Your habits, your hang-ups, your weaknesses. It was so simple to set you all on edge. You know? I had to push here, pull there. But once I did - Vince, check out the other side oftown - I knew each of you would play your part. The key to effective illusion is misdirection. You know there's a bomb on the boat, you don't run toward it first. All I needed was opportunity. The coffee break gave me the chance I needed to rig a few surprises. The answer was right in front of your eyes. You couldn't see it. It was you who said to turn offthe water. The rest was easy. You're all so fucking predictable! Nicole with her cigarettes. Can't she read the warning label on the box? Vince: "I'm never without my gun." Bobby the Magnificent couldn't resist. And Harris just had to stay and watch. The party crasher here was more of a problem than I thought, but why am I gonna work so hard to kill him when I knew... you'd do it for me? You see, the water ain't your only weakness, Sara. Your other weakness is me. In truth, Sara, I couldn't have done it without you. And as a sign of my appreciation, I'm gonna grant your deepest desire! I'm gonna get you closer to your sister than you ever imagined. 1 Mississippi, 2 Mississippi... Are we having fun yet? Drop it! Go ahead, Sara, arrest me! We have your blood under Rafe's fingernails, your fingerprints on the fire extinguisher, and your bullet in my neck. That don't look good. You're fucked. Time's up, asshole. Good thing you hit like a girl. I guess we found out his weakness: bullets. Do you think they'll let me make profiler? That depends. One last question. When's the situation secure, Agent? On the drive home. ''I Hope you Enjoyed'' ''Released By TuGAZx'' ''PTpOWeR''
