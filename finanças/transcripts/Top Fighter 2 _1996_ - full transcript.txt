- [Narrator] The woman you're watching is not avoiding danger, but pursuing it. In the current world climate of equality among the sexes, no category is left unturned, including hand to hand combat. The first athletic endeavor that broke the barrier for women fighters was professional wrestling. Although it was viewed as an undercard amusement leading up to the main event, the technical proficiency displayed by these female grapplers is on par with their male counterparts. In the film world, women were used in action films as novelties or whipping posts for a sadistic villain, where graphic scenes comprised the majority of the film until the last reel, wherein the heroin could exact some fitting revenge. Women fighters were not taken seriously. This kind of exploitation has found a permanent market thanks to stars like Amy Yip. Indeed, the continued prosperity of these films falls squarely on the shoulders of this buxomy starlet, though is almost a throwback to the by gone era of cheesecake stars like Jane Mansfield or Bridget Bardot. Yip's assets quickly took her from tit part roles to movie stardom, all done without a single pubic hair or nipple exposed. This lack of exposure actually made her devoted fans come back time and again, in the hope that the next film would show her, albeit cosmetically enhanced, breast sellers in their full glory. Amy Yip went on to catch what many Asian starlets catch towards the prime of their career, a rich husband who wouldn't mind a trophy wife that half the world's population dreams about. Although Amy showed a willpower to succeed, it isn't enough to get the audience's respect for what a woman is fully capable of achieving. Most people would be surprised to learn that one of the most proficient kung fu systems ever was invented by a woman, who, in turn, passed it onto another woman. It is the art of Wing Chun. - Because Wing Chun can either all what we call the little movements. With little movements, you really cannot make it so beautiful, because especially we don't have high kick. - [Narrator] This system was created by the only nun who survived the burning of the Shaolin temple. To help her fight a persistent bully, the nun created a system which stressed close quarter combat and technique over brute strength. The result so pleased the nun that she named the system after her student, Wing Chun, in honor for her tenacity. The old adage, "Behind every great man stands a strong woman," can be best applied to Fong Sai-yuk, the legendary Chinese fighter. It is reported that his mother singlehandedly pushed him mercilessly, yet still gave him a mother's affection. - Ma, you alright? - [Narrator] Women have always had a place in martial arts, but usually doing forms. From the relaxing postures of Tai Chi to the lightning fast hands and techniques of Wu Shu, the woman is on par with her male counterparts in this area. Chinese opera gave the female equal billing, or actually the female role, since men sometimes played all the parts on stage. With the advent of film, movie producers literally transferred the opera to the big screen. The popularity of women fighters on screen was not lost on producers who put money before gender. This led to a landmark film featuring not a student of Chinese opera, but a dancer from Shanghai. The film was called "Come Drink With Me," and Cheng Pei-Pei was the first woman in Hong Kong to receive top billing in a swordplay film. The Shaw brothers' produced film was a huge success, and opened the doors for women at the action box office. Like Cheng Pei-Pei, Hsu Feng was a prodigy of director King Hu. Her first starring role in "Touch of Zen" captivated audiences worldwide, keeping her popular throughout the 70s. She recently turned to producing, "Farewell My Concubine" being her most famous production. One lucky young lady was Shih Szu, who was chosen by the Shaw brothers executives at the young age of 15, to fill the shoes of Cheng Pei-Pei. Aside from swordplay films, Shih Szu also worked on the new action craze sweeping Chinese cinema, the kung fu movie. - [Director] And one, two, three, four, five, six, seven... - [Narrator] Hong Kong was not the only country reaping the rewards of this newly found source of entertainment. Taiwan's film industry didn't hesitate to bring their own heroins to the front lines. - My name is Polly Shang Kuan Ling Feng. - [Narrator] Polly Shang Kuan Ling Feng became an overnight movie queen with her first role in King Hu's "Dragon Inn." Polly devoted considerable time cultivating her martial art skills, gathering black belts in judo, karate, and taekwondo. The biggest compliment the Chinese paid to Polly was when they said that Bruce Lee is the dragon, but Polly is the phoenix. - Because I'm very... I shouldn't say that one few, fewer problem. I'm very fast for the action. I put it in my memory. When I see that, I don't need too much time practice. Very quick. So probably that's why I'm involved in kung fu movie so much. I got, a couple time, dangerous situation. But people, when they realize I'm a good kung fu actress, they didn't fight with me, they just left. - Let's go, come on! - People like it, like it when I'm dressed up like a little boy, little young male. I'm earn the best actress, that was in a comedy action movie. - [Interviewer] Oh, really? - So, I am funny, okay? I am funny, yeah. I don't drink, I don't smoke, no drugs, okay? Even I don't have too many boyfriends. Spend too much time with boyfriend, that's a wasted time. Have to take care of your body, very good. Yeah, most of the time, just take care of you... Yeah, and practice your kung fu action every day. I told all the reporter, news reporter, I said, "If you want me go back to my field, please don't let me play Mama! No Mama, no!" I say, "Still fight! I want a, yeah, action movie. Don't give me the mama, yeah, I don't want to be a mama, I never have children, all my life!" Kung fu, fighting's much better. - [Narrator] Chinese opera always had an influence in Chinese films, so it was only natural for the student of the discipline be chosen for the lead role. Judy Lee is one of the few women in Chinese opera who could also play male roles. The combination of feline beauty and rugged physical abilities netted her over 60 film roles. - I was seven years old, going to Fu Shing to learn the Chinese opera. And I graduated 14 years ago. The reason I'm learning the Chinese opera, because my family, my father, my aunt, they are all Chinese opera actor, actress. We practice very, very hard. Every morning, five o' clock, we wake up. Then six o' clock, we have the first class. Just doing the (speaking Chinese) Sorry, I have to speak Chinese, I don't know how to speak English in this word. Some action films, (speaking Chinese) Then, after the two hours, then we're eating breakfast, then we are taking another class for the singing and the performance. So we are learning, study, and practice the whole day. And shower nine o' clock, something, every day. Seven years. I was very famous on the stage, after I graduated from art school. In that time, as my boss... Right now he's in Hong Kong, very famous actor. Yang Shing. He's my foster boss. He saw me, the performance on the stage, he said I'm very good, doing very good job. So he asked me to try the first movie. I remember, 18 days we finished that film. And I was very hard, and the work very hard. So fortunately, the first film became famous. So it's helped me to smooth doing the job for the future. Before I'm doing the movie, I'm just very good foundation, you know, because we are Chinese opera, we are doing very seriously, very (speaking Chinese) So, we have the beginning of the kung fu. But no (speaking Chinese), I mean, the no get hurt. If I hurt somebody, no power. So just pretty, we can do the very pretty. But, after a few years, everyday we are practicing, you know, we're doing the movie, we have to learn, we have to learn lots of the (speaking Chinese), I mean, the... Can make the good work for the movie, so (speaking Chinese) means that sometimes we hurt somebody. Some kung fu movie, the story very, very good. You are very enjoyed to perform it. I don't think so, some silly, I think it's good. I never think about, well, famous or success, but I think if you're doing, you know, you do yourself, you do your best to do it, you will see the result. - [Narrator] You are watching a kung fu fanatic. If there was an award for obsessive training, it would first go to Yeung Pan Pan. Pan Pan is probably the only child in China to actually bait her mother to take her to the Chinese opera school for tutelage. - In school, we all train together. When we kicked, we did it in unison, just like they do in China nowadays. Kicking, acrobatics, and weapons. We all train together, basically northern style kung fu. I studied northern style for two years. I never learned opera, I just learned the flexibility, and the kung fu styles, which I made use of in the films I made, like the one I did with Sam, "The Seed." When I made "Duel Of The Seven Tigers" and "Story Of Drunken Master," my nickname was "Lady Jackie Chan." When we shot the drunken style movies, we used to perform over 30 movements in one shot. We used no pads, no wires, just real kung fu. - Wow, small waist! - The action movies now are a lot more comfortable and safer. We have many things to help us. It's funny, when I have to fight with a man, he'll size me up and say "Oh, you're a girl, but I'm not gonna take it easy on you." Because we want to make the scene look realistic. We really hit hard, you can hear the sound of our arms hitting. So we used pads so that we could fight much longer. Often we had to redo the scene several times, it really does hurt. So we must have pads, and the results look beautiful. Sometimes, when I take the pads off, my arms are bruised and swollen. I love shooting action films. When we start filming, I get really happy and excited. - [Narrator] Hui Ying Hung is a Shaw brothers film brat who actually grew up on their film lot. Her nickname, "Auntie," came from one of her most famous roles for them. Auntie also branched out into television, and even posed for the Asian edition of Penthouse. - Hello, I'm Auntie, how are you? I'm 30 years old. I stopped in school. No school. And I go to nightclub, Chinese nightclub. And I started this dancing, Chinese dancing, so making money to feed my smaller sister and my brother go to school. So... I'm not in school long time. I'm 16 years old, I go inside the Shaw's spot. I prefer doing traditional films, because the stories are better, and the fighting is much prettier. Modern films rely more on power. Yes, so I prefer traditional. (speaking Chinese) I think the most important quality for an action actress is guts, and you must be prepared to get hurt. If you have guts, you can achieve anything. But most important for me is that I don't want to be poor. I don't want to be a poor girl, so I want to be hard, I want to get something. So, that's my power. - [Narrator] One of the fast tracks to stardom in Asia is to do television, and after a dozen TV series, actress Moon Lee gave movies a try. It's hard to believe Moon Lee was a ballet and classical dancer before putting her feet in people's vital parts. - Action movies is... Can directly give you some message. If you just drama, I think have some countries, people can't understand them. What are you doing? What are you saying? What are you meaning? It is almost guaranteed you will get hurt when you're shooting action movie. Explosions start before I jump. I could smell my hair burn, and by the way down, I reached the ground. My wrists and part of my face are burnt. I spent months in the hospital before I recovered. - [Narrator] The popularity of these female fighting films brought girls from overseas. Yukari Oshima grew up watching Chinese kung fu action movies in her native Japan, and decided that this was the future she wanted. - When I was 13 years old, in Japan, (speaking Japanese) I learn as a Japanese Goju-ryu karate, from Mr. Miki, is one of the masters of karate. Because why? Because... Of course I saw many movies, like action martial art movies, and Chinese movies that I'm very interested about. So I learned it. Also, I study with sanichiba dance school one years. So, Hong Kong movies is real, real fighting, like sometimes it's really punch, it's very hard, sometimes really hit people, really kick people, so, very different. Japan is like, um... Just a double, just a double. But Hong Kong movies real. - [Interviewer] Have you ever been really hurt? - [Yukari] Yeah, many times, like glass. I punch glass, something ahead, break something. And then, also hard foot or something. Not big accident. - [Interviewer] Train every day? - Almost, almost, it's umm... Usually it's stretching, stretching. And if you're not shooting, it's like maybe stunt training also. It's a hard time. I want to do action. My feeling is like this. Don't think I want to be famous, not like this. Just want to show my action, power. - [Narrator] Here's somebody who doesn't mind playing with guns. Elaine Lui, a femme fatale in the classic sense. Elaine has played a diverse resume, ranging from super agent to cold blooded killer. And she carries with each role with an ease that only seasoned veterans show. - I don't know anything about kung fu before. But, in my first movie, 99 percent there is fighting scenes. Then I have to fight all the time, like fighting dog. In every single movie, I have to do different kind of kung fu all the time. So it doesn't matter, you practice this time, actions for your next movie, all that prep. Some kind of acting. And, in fact, most of the kung fu we did is stunt. I'm a stuntwoman too. Can you believe that? I was in the rapids, near the waterfall. I was lying in the waterfall, for how long, you know, the whole day long. And even my skin could peel off very easy after shooting for one day long. And I'm just sitting in between the line of life and death. I was hanging out of the helicopter with wire, four feet long. In fact, it means nothing to me, especially when you fly up 1,000 feet height. And then, the wind's so strong. It goes through your eyes, your ears, everywhere. We can't even talk. And I can hear nothing, and it's quite scared. Not quite, it's very scared. But, you know what, sometimes you'll get sick of it. When you wake up and you have to think about your job, it's all fight, fight, fight, fight, fight... For what? When you go home, when you dream, it's all fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, again. I feel crazy sometimes! Oh God, especially when two movies, you know, they bounce together. For the ending, the most important part is the ending. And when two of them get together, you have to fight from morning to next day morning. And then wake up again, it's fight again. Don't sell me out! - [Narrator] This lady was born to be a superstar. Michelle Yeoh was discovered after winning a beauty contest in her native Malaysia. Mega stardom came after sharing top billing with Cynthia Rothrock in her first feature film. - I've always loved physical activities, like, I was a sports player, I swim. Since I was in school, I've been involved with sports, like running, high jump, swimming, diving. Anything that I could lay my hands on. And also, I did ballet lessons since I was four. So when I did my first action movie, it was just another medium of movement for me, and because I loved physical, you know, the challenge so much, it felt like such a shame to let somebody else have the fun. - [Narrator] Michelle got into national recognition after co-starring with Jackie Chan in "Super Cop," and opposite James Bond himself in "Tomorrow Never Comes." If anybody has the task of representing girl power on the screen, it couldn't be handled better than Michelle. (speaking Chinese) - I used to spend, like, six to nine hours in the gym with the stunt boys, and they were very good. They would come there on rotational basis, just to teach me the moves and things like that. And because I was a ballerina before, I'm very supple. And also, I'm coordinated, and I'm able to pick up movements, and mimic movements quite well. So I was just learning how to transfer that energy, and to get that power across to the camera. As long as they were willing to teach me, I could try it out, I could do it. But, you know, when you work with them a little bit more, and then also when I hit them a couple of times quite hard, then they realize, "Okay, if she can hit us that hard, then she must be able to take something back." And it has to be like that, because, you know, how the directors in Hong Kong. Unless you get a good hit, it's not gonna be a good take. So I'd rather be hit two or three times well than 15 to 20 times not so good. - [Interviewer] What about period films? You know, the costume fighting, you like doing those? - Yes and no. Yes, because it's actually easier to do than contemporary action movies. - [Interviewer] Why? - Because with the action sequences, there's a lot of wire work, that's the only tough part. All that flying around, you know, it's... It's very visual. But when it comes down to the actual action of it, it's not so detailed. It's like Wing Chun, which I did with (speaking Chinese) That kind of fighting gets to be more physical, with all the arm movements, and you learn a lot more. So when we were in China, I had that wooden stance on my balcony. Every morning that I came out... - [Interviewer] Like Jackie in "Rumble In The Bronx?" - Yeah, you have to do that, so that when you did it, you were convincing. Honestly, whenever you do an action sequence, when I walk off the set, when you go home and you're sitting in your bath, you literally look like someone's thrown you down a flight of stairs at least 10 times over, because you're literally black and blue all over the place. (speaking Chinese) When you see the reaction of your audience, and you think, "50 years down the road, I'll be sitting in my rocking chair, and this is the same kind of reaction I'm going to get still." And then you know it's worth it. - [Narrator] After Michelle Yeoh's first retirement, Taiwanese dancer Yang Li Tsing was picked to succeed Michelle and Cynthia Rothrock as the production company's lady whirlwind. She was given the new name of Cynthia Khan, and her duties were quite simple: Surpass the quality performances of your earlier counterparts. It would be unfair to make comparisons between all these unique individuals, but it is safe to say that Cynthia Khan holds her own weight on any scale of comparison. As aerobics and weight training started becoming acceptable activities for women, the physical appearances of the leading ladies started to change. There was no need to wear only buttoned up Mandarin collars without so much as a wrist or ankle exposed. The new breed didn't just show it, they flaunted it. Following a strict regime of weight training diet and martial arts instruction, British actress Sophie Crawford gained constant employment on screen. - I have no foundation whatsoever. The only sports I had done was like the usual, swimming, riding... Okay, I was fairly fit. But I had to build up some muscle, some strength, and the flexibility, and then punch the bag every day, and the kicks, and everything like that. And after that, you might think that okay, from there, you can go straight into films, but when you actually get onto the set, you might spend hours and hours punching the bag with full contact, but then you get onto the set, and the first thing they do is tell you to hold your power, hold your power. So, in the beginning, there were a couple of occasions when I accidentally hit a stuntman or an actor. But you learn the control as you go along. Shit! I think Hong Kong is a great foundation for me to get as much practical experience as I can for my future, because you can really experiment in front of the camera here. You can do basically what you like, you can play around. - [Narrator] Michiko gained fame in her native Japan by becoming a three times powerlifting champion. Aside from her strength, Michiko is also adapt at gymnastics and martial arts. Needless to say, she developed an instant following. - At first, when I was in high school, I tried gymnastics. And then, I try bodybuild and power lifting. I used to be bodybuild champion, powerlifting champion. And later I tried karate and Chinese martial art. And also filming, I try Japan first and then I come to Hong Kong. There was a lot of problem, because of women. It's easier now, somebody helps make fighting, sometimes. But the first time, I almost try myself. That's why I get some scar. - [Interviewer] Can we see the scar again? - This is a nick from shooting with Jackie Chan. I'm a natural action actress in Japan, but I can do, and also, sometimes is very exciting. In fact, I think for western people, Hong Kong film is not really about action. But we need making very creepy, also making very sharp and beautiful. Please don't thinking about I'm action actress, fighting actress, I'm... Filming, I can try romantic film, and everything. I think my English is getting very good, getting better. If you need Asian girl, please call me! - [Narrator] This Taiwan weight lifting champion is a female Bruce, or brunette Lee. Although it seems difficult at times to distinguish her from a man, the Lady Dragon shows us that the gap between the sexes isn't necessarily that wide. If you are looking for grace as well as beauty under pressure, then look no further than world champion kickboxer Kathy Long. Her training schedule and ring record put respect in women fighting with capital letters. - It's a lot of hard work. I've had my hands broken, I've had my ribs broken, I've had my nose broken, my shin fractured. And all these injuries were in training. And I've had torn muscles, and I've just been tired and achy, and you have to keep going. You have to understand that it's not easy. It's not a walk in the woods. And it's not gonna happen overnight. I do love to fight, yeah, it's very exciting. There's nothing more real or honest than getting hit in the face. You don't have to wonder what's going on. You don't have to wonder if "Am I supposed to hit this person?" No, that's what you're there for, and it's the ultimate one on one competition. There's no team that you have to rely on, other than your cornerman, obviously. But when you're in the ring, you're doing it. You're either doing it or you're not doing it. And no one's gonna help you, no one's gonna make the decision for you. - [Narrator] Meet Kung Fu Mama. Words cannot describe the real ability of this Qigong and kung fu mistress, whose exploits have yet to be matched on film. But then again, who would want to? Cynthia Rothrock actually broke the barriers of Chinese only as lead roles in Chinese films. You could say that what Bruce Lee did to Hollywood films, Cynthia did to Hong Kong movies. Cynthia impressed fickle directors and choreographers by holding her own time and again. - It was probably the best training ground for me, is to start in Hong Kong. A fight scene in Hong Kong you might take one month to shoot, in America, they'll say "We got one day to do it." So there's a big difference there. When I made my transition from films, I would hit them a little bit harder, and all the stuntmen were going "Ow!" And complaining, I was like "I'm sorry!" I just came back from Hong Kong, cause I was used to them saying "Cynthia, more power! More power!" And you can get anybody and teach them a roundhouse kick. And a punch. You can teach anybody in one day how to look like you could fight like that, but the way what they do in Hong Kong is you have to be a skilled martial artist to be able to perform those moves. You can't fake it. (speaking Chinese) (speaking Chinese) I feel very strongly that it's so easy to defend yourself, and it could save your life someday, so I think I have always been sort of a crusader, especially for women, that they should learn some type of martial art. - [Announcer] Angela Mao. She's the renowned deadly China Doll. She's clever. She's quick. And she fights to kill. - I am Angela Mao. - [Announcer] She's 100 percent lethal. She's lady whirlwind. Mistress of the death blow. Queen of the deep thrust. - My martial art skills were very good, so I was taught fighting warrior roles, both fighting and singing. We woke up at five in the morning to train gymnastics. Midday we'd practice singing, afternoon we studied books, and more acrobatics in the evening. In 1970, Raymond Chao of Golden Harvest came to Taiwan looking for new actors. A writer friend of mine, Chu Kar-shen, introduced me. He loved watching Peking opera, and he knew I was famous on the stage. They needed a female lead for a martial arts film called "Angry River." It was to be directed by Huang Feng, who later became my godfather. My ability met his requirements, and that's how I got into Golden Harvest. - [Narrator] But if one woman can encompass all the traits of a top fighter, it would have to be Angela Mao Ying. Angela appeared on the silver screen at the height of the kung fu craze. The result was an instant success at the box office. Her western name was originally Barbara Lee in order to cash in on the Bruce Lee mania, but studio owner Raymond Chao insisted on giving Angela her own identity, and it paid off. - Sammo Hung, Chang Yi, and I went to Korea to film "Lady Whirlwind." Whilst we were there, we learned Hapkido. We really trained hard, and were awarded third dan blackbelts. When we got back to Hong Kong, we made the film "Hapkido." After "Hapkido" I was approached by Bruce Lee and Bob Klaus to guest star in "Enter The Dragon." I had signed with Golden Harvest for five years. When the contract was up, I returned to Taiwan to shoot films. I shot "Dance Of Death," directed by Jackie Chan. In that film, I used a lot of opera moves like backflips and somersaults. Wash your hands! Wash hair! Wash feet! - The dancing girl washing, that's mine! (groaning) - Dancing holding. - Dancing holding, that's mine too! - Washing the clothes. Wash hands. Wash feet. Washing the face. - On New Year's Day, I was coming home from my godfather's house, when this guy attacked me. I was young and cocky, so I kicked him a few times and he ran off. This incident made TV headlines. I had just moved to the states. I took my son to 42nd Street. Some people came up to me and said, "Are you Angela Mao?" I was surprised they knew who I was. Pai Lai Lee, I've come here to get revenge for my murdered brother. I don't even care if it kills me! But you won't live either! - [Narrator] To show the true meaning of girl power, we feel this fight scene of Judy Lee from the film "Queen Boxer" best proves the fact that hell hath no fury like a female top fighter attacked.
