The battue has started. A school of halibuts has crossed the Gulf Stream. Trawlers and cutter surround the fish. A factory trawler follows them. Have a good catch! Let's hope we have enough cans. The industry rejoices, we will have fresh supplies. Now it's time for gutting and filleting. Wholesome fish goes to tomato sauce. [Russian] Dear comrade, about your letter from 7th February 1968, we inform we have sent you 15 books you have been interested in... And these are the heroes of our anonymous expedition. The skipper with his nice crew. Soaked with salt, from the ocean he knows like the back of his hand. A shark! Look! WJrada! A shark! - What's going on? - It's a shark. - I must go, it will be overcooked. - Can't the dinner wait? Is it to spite me? Can't you watch? There are sharks. [Russian] These books are not available, but we will definitely send them to you as soon as they are back in the market. Artur, tell us how grandpa rescued the whole Anders army. It was night, grandpa was sitting in the trench. The Germans were on the recce, one farted and grandpa thought it was shooting. He threw the granats, but they were sealed with wax. It's not really true. - Don't mess with his mind. - The child is on your side. - But... - The child will not lie for you. We wish you success with your work. Look, seals, lots of them. Yes, I see. W'rada! - What is it? - Look, seals. That's true. Lovely seals. There will be dolphins. Close the kitchen door, bad smells are coming. Dolphins sometimes jump through a ring. Seals are the polar man's most faithful friends. When the polar night comes, the seal falls asleep. Woken up by a Lapp or Eskimo, it rapidly comes back to water. Haven't you seen the glass? And the polar man returns alone to his igloo. The seal's favourite activities are swimming and diving. The glasses get lost all the time! Last week I bought 6 for 8 zloties. It's not about money, they are just difficult to get. And why should I deal with these silly things? I come home laden and the glasses get lost! Wmdek, have you seen the glass? The glass! In the morning the sun came up, the wax melted and the whole German army was blown up. Unlike seals, sharks are people's enemies. "It's good they don't get on the coast" - say our cheerful hosts. Have you been to the housing cooperative? Have you asked? No, I haven't. Of course. How could you leave your desk? And what am I doing? Working, aren't I? Working the whole day. What is it about? Of course you are working. Of course, I am not saying you should go. No, no... I have the child to care. Don't I? Yes, I will do it as soon as possible, there was a misunderstanding. Perhaps I've used the wrong words. It's a man thing, you must deal with it. When I used to work, I could get out, from home I can't. Do it tomorrow. Hear me? Overcooked. Lie down. And this is how one more day has passed. It's not true what the song says: that a fisherman has fun all days and then sleeps in a hammock. As you can see, a fisherman drags his trawl tirelessly. Do you know Teresa, a nurse from your former hospital? She asked me about you when I was there for inhalation. Yes, we used to work together. And she did the course with me. Six more shots and you finish your treatment. These vitamins will make you better. But I feel pretty good even without them. Don't be ridiculous. When fish is abundant, the fisherman won't leave his net - it is his workshop and the pupil of his eye. This might be interesting. You know, next week it will be about fish. You must go and talk or we won't get this flat even in two years. Everybody does it, you may not like it, but we must be persistent. Don't write at home just one day, go and do it. And we must enrol Artur to school. He is seven, he is so bright, perhaps he could start with second class. Artur, leave it. Sit down to your dinner. [Russian] I wish you success in your work. You fried the potatoes again! What for? If you want to kill me, just give me poison. Where are you going? Crazy psychopath. Dinner is on the table. Can't you see? I will just get the cigarettes and come back. - Not good. - What? Cigarettes? Such flightiness is close to perversion. Not good. A pigeon tried just a drop of nicotine and died. Just a drop. - Where was that? - On TV. It's not good. - Why do you complain? - I am not a cook. - They are pretty good. - But too hard. They should be hard. But not so much. Something else should be that hard. Like what? Something else. - Why aren't you eating? - Grandpa lifted a stone and moved it. I forgot to buy cigarettes and I have work to do. Close the machine, so it won't gather dust. A FILM BY ANDRZEJ WAJDA THE FLY HUNTING written by: starring: music by: Photographed by: directed by: Good afternoon, or maybe good evening. So I asked her: "Wouldn't you like to do some jumping movements with me?" And she says what? Man, I have a ticket for you. For today. - I don't want to go. - I will let it cheap, 15. - But this is a Lainia club ticket. - Doesn't matter, you will dance. Let me express! So I say... Nice ladies. What's the rule? Let's play, so they won't sleep. Nice skin. They are under age. So, young ladies? If it's like that, let it be so. Have a look. Wait a second. I come to him and he... woops. Just like that... The carter leaves his wagon, the farmer leaves his flail... You see. The bricklayer leaves his trovel, and clogs come from a dead man. I knew a patient. She had sick tonsils. Here. But she took so much oxygen, like a compressor. Wicked chick. A blonde, doesn't have a family in Liverpool but listens to the Beatles all nights. - Father in law is a salesman. - You man, give us a ciggy. So, I take them to my flat. I say, girls, we haven't known each other for long, just don't take my valuables. It happened once. I call her and I say: Zolda at home? It was her brother in law and he says... Go to the quoin, you're not a toy. You know, it's a mistake. It happens. What mistake? Golden hair, hazel ears, cut here, curved there. Maybe pregnant. So I tell the ladies: in this situation this evening has no punch line. And let's take the fancy-pants. We won't take him, he will come by himself. Going to the deck, soon will be back. - Hi, Wmdek. - Hello. Getting bald? How are you? How much do you make a month? Have you travelled west? Have a car, a flat? Where have you got this jacket? Haven't you seen W'radek or Czesiek recently? Come inside. I remember how they suspended you. Pals, make some space, come on. Don't worry. I am in charge here. He is with me. Let us pass. You've come to have fun, pals. All right, come in. Jasio, let them come. - You won't come. - Why? - You are not African. - So who? It's not my problem. He's with me. Oh, you've done a spoof at university. I remember. Come in. Good, isn't it? Let's dance, friends, everybody. The whole floor. Don't bring us shame with foreigners. Dance or leave the floor. What trouble did you stir at college back then? I forgot. Friends, this table is booked for the group from France, leave it. Thank you. To the bar. Come, old man, feel invited. No wife, no child, travelling. You see, I am working in this branch, hard work all the time. Lectures, travels. Paris, Moscow, London, Brussels. Dear friend, the wine is limited, not more than three per person and I see it's your sixth. Athens. Working all the time, on the road. Meetings, lectures, talks with foreign colleagues, discussions. I deal with art a bit. I have just bought a lovely book, Italian painting. I've been there. Copenhagen, too. Do you know how was Che Guevara murdered? Do you? Tell me. Listen, old man, they were surrounded by troops, two thousands, and just four of them. Do you understand me, or you don't? No, he doesn't. Yes, we support liberation movements. Excuse me, lady, do you know they cut his finger off and sent to the USA by plane, to be recognized? Who was Che for you? It's nice we have met so incidentally, isn't it? Yes, coincidences shape our fortune. My name is Irena, I am a graduate in Polish faculty, I am writing my MA thesis. And you? I have done 5 semesters of Russian. Anyway, I have to go home, I dropped just for a moment. I'm Wmdek. You know, I stay at my aunt's, she's lovely but a bit puritan. She cannot understand some of my actions. It was so rough and masculine of you to help me. I Wish I had. You could have pretended not to see. Yes, yes. So, perhaps... we could dance? With these boys... Could I walk you home? However, in fact, I have to go... Let's be on first names terms. I love structuralists, I am writing an essay on OJrubiec. Ah, OJrubiec. One of the greatest personalities in the '58 generation. Of course. An amazing man, really cutting-edge. Have you noticed the concept of time in his last works? Yes. When did you finish your studies? I have a break. I was suspended in 1955 and I haven't come back. But I have done 5 semesters. Yes, you've told me. Why were you suspended? I was told to write an essay "Griboyedov - the Shakespeare of Russian literature". So in English class I wrote "Shakespeare - the Griboyedov of English literature". That's funny, rough, masculine, typical for you. Just like today, you pushed these playboys away. Just your style. I work in an office, I've got a payrise recently. It's here. Come tomorrow at 2 to university. See you. Every bear's favourite snack is fresh honey. The persistent tracker remembers it, waiting for the bear on the other side of the river. The hunter knows each path the animals take to the waterhole. Give me the flypaper. Come on, give me the flypaper, it's there. You see, I've just met a friend, from University, and that's why... It was the same with the last flypaper we had, they don't stick well, besides we should open the windows wider. And that's why the friend... And the friend... Finish this clicking, you've been writing the whole evening, lie down. A fly should go left, this is correct, and the last one flew right. Who? The fly. So, the friend I've met... Tomorrow you must go to the cooperative, no buts. I couldn't get rid of him. But the cooperative closes at 4, I finish work the same time. - You will leave early. - It's difficult. Talking to you is difficult. It is to be done. - Remember. - I'll try. Trying is not enough, just do it. It's not easy, my boss never takes his eyes from me. Make him do it. Sir, this is nonsense to buy the whole litre of milk when I only drink a glass. I have exact change. I've counted at home, it's 12,60 a month for one glass a day. So, this is the first payment. So, if you allow me, I will do it every month. Welcome to the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw. You are in the very centre of the capital city, in a building 231 metres high, with 817000 cube metres capacity. It covers 53848 square metres. It houses 3312 various rooms. Before you go to the 30th floor, to see the Warsaw vista from the viewing terrace, we would like to provide you with some information. The Palace was given to Polish society by Soviet builders on 22 July 1955. I'd like to talk about the pay rise. But you have got it recently. It was very little. Thank you, Whadek. But you haven't got a degree. I've done 5 semesters. It's not completed. Yes, but it's more than a half. I will try to do something. But you shouldn't have joked about Shakespeare and Griboyedov. Thank you very much. And I would like to go out for twenty minutes, if possible. All right. But perhaps you could complete your degree? We could help you. Yes, yes, I will think about it. I have never left work early, but today I really have to. You can go, provided you complete your duties. And I know you do. This is nonsense. Mum has told father that she won't bear his jealousy any more. And father is terribly jealous all the time. Have you talked to him? Yes, but he is stubborn, we don't get on. I understand your father. But mum has discussed everything with him. No arguments, no jealousy, each of them has a right to their own life. L'amour est bien plus fort que nous. But this was too much. Your mother could go away with this man for a few days and that's it. For example to SpaJra. You surprise me. It's not the point, I am not prudish, just realistic. SpaJra is one thing, paralding with someone on Sunday in Nowy Swiat is another. Before they come to their home docks, sometimes they are surprised by storms. Our flotilla forms a salient then, facing the element, stern by stern. It's high time to start hunting. We can hear the pompous sonar sounds. Tell us, how a scythe cut off your grandpa's toe. Grandpa wasn't careful, he was in the field, barefoot. You see? Leave it! Have you been to this cooperative? Have you asked them? - Of course, you haven't. - Dear comrades... So why did you want parents to help us with the payments? And why have we bought new furniture? Caution, comrades. Another glass is lost. One more plugged pseudo-sport. We can see a western pro, tormenting an Australian marsupial. The fight has been fixed since the very beginning. I was sure no one will face the consequences. Like children, nobody is brave enough. Grandpa carried an English officer across the border and he didn't even shake his hand at a party at the embassy. I think Grandpa has broken the glass. It's not true! What do you teach him? - I only broke a plate 3 days ago. - You know it's not about the plate. He's broken it himself. Leave the child alone. If Artur had broken it, he would have told us. - Show me your hands. - Why? There was coffee in the glass, there might be spots. A bishop's daughter was in love with grandpa, a general's wife and a professor's wife. They all wanted to marry him, but he didn't. - Now the other one. - Maybe it's got lost. We will find it. I have also seen daddy, wiping his hands. Where are you going? Stand next to your father. Show me your hands. - In this situation you should admit. - Why? - There are ethical problems. - Why? You are not able to sacrifice. Your hands are all right, but it doesn't prove anything. I have new suspicions. Mum has also been sweeping under the bed. Leave your mum alone. Don't denounce without evidence. You may not admit, if you lack courage and spirit, but you will all drink your tea from the pot. Apart from Mummy. Anyway, I have asked for a pay rise. - What do you say? - I have asked for a pay rise. And? Have they agreed? - Apparently, they have. - Apparently? Or definitely? Rather definitely. A fly has caught. - Perhaps they will open. - They never will. Where to go, if they do not open? I think they might open. - I report they won't. - Don't report. Hold on, something is moving. What's moving? I won't go back at this time. In my opinion they will open. I will keep waiting. - I wouldn't expect. - Sir, let us in. Will he open? Open, sir! I've made a reservation. They won't. Do you know any other place to party? No. I don't. I couldn't come then. It's wonderful you are here. I knew you would come. Something happened that day. It's in your style, I like it. Masculinity, roughness - but you are sensitive inside, like a western character produced by infantile pop culture. Are you married? - Me? - Yes. - How do you know? - The ring. Actually, I am. And I have... a child. It would be surprising, if a man like you was alone. And I like children. You can't waste your energy. It's nonsense, with your clever mind. We must think of something. Griboyedov! But it's not a good translation, Gora dumaz' means something else. I have an idea, you should translate plays or poetry. I wouldn't manage. I haven't finished my studies. And your 5 semesters of Russian? Besides feelings, devotion, sensitivity are more important. I could help you, I would do the proofreading! I must go home now, I really have to, don't I? Oh, you office and your home. Nobody would notice your absence. The six years you have given them is a nonsense, a mistake. A man like you cannot show his worth in an office. What, what... Help! Police! Let me hold your magazine. Help! Police! Help! People! Don't! Stand still. What for? I wanted but I couldn't. You've been brilliant, it's just your style. If only I could get there on time. I am leaving for a day or two for a philologist convent. We will talk when I am back. We have to think about our future. These are not trivial things. We must sort them out. Wait here, I have an idea. Citizen, come here, please. Your ID, please. Here you are. Profession: a philologist. I see. And where is the lady? She lives here. Who is she for you? It's just... I only.. I will go now. Here you are. I think we will meet again. Here I have two poems we translated at class. Translate them and I will organize for them to be published. When I am back, I will call you at the office. Listen, something has happened. Listen. So? Yes, yes. I've lost my... monthly ticket. You aren't normal. - I want to tell you something. - Yes? I went out suddenly. - What? - I went out. And you see... I've found the fork. Listen, Hanka, there is something. - Have you talked to this pensioner? - Pensioner? - To stop pouring out the milk. - What? - Pouring out. - Yes. But he still does. One day I will hit his bald head. - What have you told him? - He will pay. He might be ill. I don't know, I am easily disgusted. How much does he want to pay? 12,60. He gave some money yesterday. Can't he take it from someone else? Let him do it, I would feel silly. All right, after all. But only this month. Can you hear me? Yes. - So, good night. - Night. Let's start with the questionnaire C. It is to meet your individual needs. You can make notes. It evokes sensitivity and opens the possibility of bold and precise assessments. The questionnaire D... Please, do not make notes. It can be called an internal survey. I have noticed some points here but it doesn't seem appropriate to develop this topic. Hello? Wrong number. You are welcome to talk to me individually. The consulting can take place in any chosen time. Of course, if there are any detailed questions, I am ready to answer. Hello? No, sir, I cannot ask anybody, there is a meeting. Interesting, a clever mind, I wouldn't think of that. And what are the results? What do you think? - Something for you. - Any news? - Police summons. - I do not really know what it is. It raises a question. - I must go. - Please, do. Handing you this symbolic cup, I wish you, comrade philologist, that it wasn't the last time you've done this. Thank you, it's really... We are here to thank you for helping us to subdue hooligan element. If every citizen... was so brave and determined, everything would look different. You do not know, how bad we feel, not being understood by the society. You know, one day I was walking and suddenly the three of them come with springs. One was small, but when I saw the other two..., I thought it would be difficult. Anyway, what's your name? Caught red handed with her? Let's say you work hard, a night in the office... We have all finished work, so perhaps I could invite you, I would bring some wine from the shop. Yes, but maybe at our next meeting. Of course. Editor, sir..., ...so, 3 men with springs approached me. Especially about those two I thought there would be trouble. You have said that. Capitan, the strangler is here. Give him to number 13. I'm coming. I've seen you somewhere. Aren't you too loud, by the way? Thank you very much. The three, with springs, attacked me and you know, editor... Finish it, all right. They were disappointed. Sirs, I would like to thank you, I am really grateful. I just behaved as it should be done, with hooligans. Now I am working on translations and later I will write something else. You can count on me. Life is about expressing individuality. Yes. I even don't know, maybe I will get divorced. Everybody can do it, so... God, I hope she calls. So, let's toast the commissioner. We could give you a medal, but there is so much fuss. And this vase is quite nice. A souvenir. Oh, it's you. Congratulations for your fiance'. Have they informed you? Why haven't you called me? - Look what I've got. - Let's go to my place. What about your aunt? She's gone to the cinema and we have two hours for ourselves. Come here. Let's finish with this philistinism. What's made you do it? The semantics. It was wonderful. At the convent we discussed about lngarden's quasi judgements and Jacobson's language functions, then Goldmann and Popper. I thought you won't be back, I was aware.. Every awareness means being aware of something. It's Popper. I have thought everything through during the convent. Everything is clear to me. We shouldn't waste our time. Your family has no right to imprison you. If you want, I can talk to them, even today. - I prefer to do it myself. - I knew you would, it's typical for you. Don't be too harsh, though. Just tell them it cannot continue. Yes, of course. I'll talk to her. I'll tell them: 'we cannot do this anymore'. How could I live like that? But I've had enough. I'll tell them: 'you have no right to hold me backl'. Enough is enough! That's not bad. But needs some changes. See,honey? The beginning is done. My aunt's cups. She bought them in antique shop but she doesn't use them at all. That ridiculous cult of things. The world as a place for stuff. I'm glad you specialize in Russian studies. That's a rare thing now. They have great writer's houses in Crimea. Somethings pinching my back. Structural anthropology. I sleep with it. What do you want, honey? We could've never met. My life would've been pointless... We've won a great chance. Until now your life was inauthentic. - You're saying the poems are lousy. - They're not bad. See? And this was my first time. I know it can get better. I think you should specialise in prose. I've got a new idea. It's a happy coincidence. Put that on. Tomorrow we're going to see OJrubiec. We talked about you and you made him curious. - We'll take his car to Nieporqt. - What for? It's good to be seen in there. The others will see you with him and you'll have a chat. About what? What do you mean? You'll tell him about yourself. He likes masculine men with lazy moves. You think my moves are... - ...lazy? - Of course. Use words 'chaos', 'confused' when you talk to him. He likes that. And come to an agreement with you family. What's the point of that meeting with Otubiec? I'm sure it's going to work. - Why? - Because you're talented. You need to go now! My aunt will be back in a minute! Many sailors owe their lives to dolphins which are the most intelligent creatures in the depths... A dolphin can weigh up to 1000 pounds. No wonder it can lift a sailor as he was a feather. I'm a little late because... I wanted to work a bit longer. We're not allowed to take typewriters home anymore. WJrada! Look, it's reindeers! They're so resilient. Reindeers are not only hats, gloves or wallets. In many countries these are draught animals. They're patient enough to wear special straps for weeks. - A week's too long. - What do you know! Your grandfather chased that Gestapo soldier... It would endure! The German dived under ice and grandpa followed him. Look, Hanka. I'm very sorry but now you're taking care of the kid, I have to work more to keep up with the others. Have you been to housing association? Yes. But they were already closed. I'll try again tomorrow. We'll see. You better do it. Where's the boy? Gestapo man was in the hole in the ice and grandpa got him. - I've found the glass. - Praise the Lord. Hanka! - What? - Time for injection. Just a minute! You sit at home all day so you can wait. - Where was it? - Here. As I suspected. Flypaper is a very primitive method of oppression. We should contain chemically all the window frames. And the pigeons... Wmdek! Go to bed. Come to bed, Wmdek. - You're already here? - I am, darling. No more injections. - We could get some more. - We've got no prescription. - I know a doctor. - You can't complete any task. We met at the university. He's an internist. - Ask him for calcium as well. - Sorry? - Calcium. - How much? - Ask him. He's an internist. - You're right. You know what? I forgot to turn off the gas. It's alright. I did it. - Well? - I know. - Goodnight then. - Goodnight. - Hey! - Hey! I'm glad. Really glad. Your flat is a mess. - How are you anyway? - So so. - I'm glad. - Me too. - Have you got a new project? - Yeah... What you did to us... - There's no us. - What?! Right. - You look great, honey. - Great, you say. Maybe even better than before. But life got too intense for you. You had a breakdown on the threshold of success. That's who you are. - But I... - I'm not blaming you. I was sad that you wasn't able to prove yourself because that meant my psychological diagnosis was wrong and my love was gone. I can't love someone just because he's talented. I still believe you are talented. But your personality is not interesting for me anymore. - Are your tools in its place? - Yes. I was spreading butter with it, though. You're right. You've done so much for me. I was ready to sculpt... Those programmes, glasses... That bloody vernissage... I wanted to apologise to you but you stopped coming here. Tell me, why?! _ I $tQp ped vist- ~ Yes'! mg you? I hate your dilemmas! There's no room for metaphysics and anxiety, my dear. The world is terribly clear and absurdly logical. - Where's the device? - What device? - For cooking. - Well... - I've lent it to my neighbours. - When? - A week ago. - Of course they didn't return it. No. Damn it! - Get it then. - I'm on it. You know what? I know a great guy who could use your studio. He's masculine and sharp - nothing like you. He's a translator. I've discovered him and we need to help him. He won't disappoint me. Us. I'm pulling him out of the greyness he fell into by accident. And I need your studio for him. You're not using it anyway. - We have to move in today. - Alright. What about me? - What about your fiancée? - She got married. Then you'll be living at my aunt's. I'll find you something else later. Give me the keys. Listen... I'm so glad you came and you don't blame me. I'm not blaming you, honey. Get the cooker. Go on. I've made you some coffee. - It should help you concentrate. - Maybe... Take your coat off. I talked to someone from Young Thoughts. They're going to publish it for sure. - Why? - Because you're doing a great work. - What if it's useless? - It isn't. It can't be. [speaking Russian] Commander, commissioner... Translation should be accurate but move freely between the phrases. Just sense the rhythm and intention. Their eyes collided quietly. The look in their eyes said everything. Commanding officer and commissioner. Commander, commissioner... Relax, darling. I can't feel it! I have no master's degree. I won't make it. Why should it? Their eyes hung, bonded... The look said everything. " Very 900d. - Really? Of course. It's always hard at the beginning. Then you'll be doing it effortlessly. Drink your coffee. - Don't I have too much of it? - No. Some more. What does it mean? - I guess it's moaning. - Don't guess. Here's your dictionary. Well? A yelp, whining or lament. Dear Lord... Hey! Pour some cold water over your hair. It won't help. What for? Now relax and think about it. The whizz of the bombs... The bombs whining... Whistling would be the best although it's not accurate. - The fierce whining of the bombs! - Honey, you can't burn out like that. Stop the hysterics. Everything's going to be alright. Why the tension? Lamenting bombs crush the rocks. Maybe it should say fierce lament? Lament can't be fierce! - What was that “w” word? - A yelp, whine, lament... Maybe whining? We can't be so accurate then. I'm taking you for a walk. - Come on. - I'm coming. The bombs with a bang or a howl? Choose the whizz and don't worry about it. It's free translation after all. Anyway we're taking a walk right now. Don't think about it now, you'll be more focused afterwards. Let's talk about something else. Relax and have a rest. - Look at the bird! - Where? It's gone. Look around, identify with nature... Think of something surprising: the sun, the sand... That exercises your imagination, it helps writers a lot. OJrubiec always does it when he's relaxing. But I'm not Ombiec... I'm tired. Take a deep breath. Relaxing isn't easy. Do some more walking and I'll make you a cup of coffee. We'll go back to work in a minute. Wmdek! Your coffee's ready! Commander, commissioner... It's been long since I last went to Nieporqt. I've never been there. It must be a beautiful place. Such a beautiful field. Desert in Mazowsze. Am I right, Mr Owbiec? Commander, commissioner... - Did you say something? - No. - But I heard you. - The fields are so beautiful. I was right. Wtodek is a young and talented translator. Who is he? Are we approaching Nieporqt yet? It must be going 95 miles an hour! NEAR TO TEARS I'm telling you Miss Basia, you're calculating it wrong. It's the capital of voivodeship so I should get a higher salary. What kind of capital is that? Good morning. Good morning. Hi! - Who was that? - Some young poet. - What am I doing? - Stop singing. Won't you sit with us? I'll leave you two alone. That's a pretty thing you've got there. A yellow-faced watch. Let's not waste time dancing. At home I've got delicious ham and two spare rooms - dining room and execution room. - I'm not interested. - That's a pity. I guarantee 15 minutes of carefree pleasure in psychedelic style. - We could put on bathrobes right away. - No, thank you. - Who's that? - TV director. I'm a TV director but that's irrelevant at the moment. Let's keep dancing. - But we could say it's a capital. - I can't make an exception for you. It's about my translation... And about my... chaotic life. I studied Russian literature for 5 semesters but then I was suspended for this joke I made... Can you confront me with that boy? - Which one? - The one you were dancing with. I'm sorry to say but I don't know him. - I saw you with him. - Wrong address. That's a shame. I know how to express my gratitude. The girls is great but the rest is rubbish. - Who is he? - He's the son of... Oh! Are you putting any translated scripts on TV? No. But yours is truly a television look. Television has its own rules. That could be our advantage. - Should we go to my place? - Who's that? Chief editor of He&She magazine. With his wife. - What would you say? - Tough luck. - Would you care to dance? - Yes. - Nice to meet you. - Your magazine is great! It's got its own style. Very specific. I was discussing it with other Polish philologists in the context of mass media. In television we lack young and modern girls. That's your big chance. I need to go. Who's that? A few hundred feet of tomatoes in a greenhouse. The wife is doing the magazine. He's just putting his name on it. - Oh! - That's how it is. - You know what readers need. - Indeed, thank you. - Will you take a part of my script? - Who's that girl? 58, Piwna street, father on business trip. Should we go back? You managed to establish a dialogue with the society. I've got so confused... But you with your artistic and moral recognition... If you could help me... It's a chance of rebirth for me. Before I met Irena, I had no idea I was going to become a translator. It's not like I wasn't considering it. I just didn't realize it. After I translated poems and prose, I'm going to write a sketch. If they translate one-act play, I would get a grant... I would stay at the Black Sea, in one of those writer's houses... Please, help me. Bugger off. Two human beings sometimes look for each other for years. I accepted your first class ticket although you're not entitled to it. Extraordinary! Truly extraordinary! Could you introduce me to him, my child? - We haven't met. - Bummer. Have you got matches? No! - I want to get in touch. - With whom? With him. Where's OJrubiec? Meet, gentleman. I'm so glad! Your father is a very efficient man. I know how to express my gratitude. Don't worry about OJrubiec. He's a mug. It's clearly his revenge. Two weeks ago I spoke to him about his works... I was writing this paper, Transcendental visions of Oiubiec. It was supposed to be published in Young Thoughts and... At first he was very nice and invited me to his apartment to show me the notes for his antinovel. But then he started hitting on me. It was nice but not compatible with writer's ethics. I wanted to keep distance to his work. And I was already in love with you. There are two faces of OJrubiec and Elliot's shade between them. His writing and himself. Someone's scratched my car! My new car! Where's the manager of this guarded car park?! - I'm not leaving it like this. - Get in. Don't get me started! My new car! Yours is truly a television look. Television has its own rules. - Should we go to my place? - No. You need to understand... I'm not happy I can't develop ...my greenhouse business. Talk to your father. I know how to express my gratitude. Why are you sad, darling? - It's our first weekend together. - You keep walking away. I have to take care of us. - I'm doing it for you. - Don't leave me alone. I've got another idea. I heard you're a great translator. With phenomenal feel for the phrase. Brave scout! Where were you? - Why should I dance with her not you? - She has to get fascinated by you. - Be yourself. - Let her dance with her husband. They don't love each other. She's very lonely. And I want you to be a recognised translator. Why are you acting against us? You think it's easy for me to look at you seducing her? - Me? - But I'm not blaming you. Be nice to her, darling. Don't worry about me. - What does she want? - It doesn't matter. We need to be kind to her. It's so nice in here. Do you come here often? When are you leaving? - My husband is in a minute. - I don't understand. - I'm staying. - Where? In here. I've got my own room in this hotel. It must get boring in here after a while. It depends. I'm not bored. I'm taking a rest. Irena told me you're alienated. I can see you're nervous. Not at all. It's a very nice room. Can you see the lake from here? Yes. We're making a special and that's why I brought you here. Where have your works been published? - It's so hot in here! - Take something off then. - I'll fetch some water. - Don't be ridiculous, my dear. - What are you willing to give me? - Sorry? For my magazine. What are you working on right now? Excuse me, I'll change. - I need translations. - How do I get out of here? I'd like to leave with your husband. - Why? - I'm a translator. - I'm starting work in the morning. - You'll have coffee then, Wtodek. - But Irena... - Not now! In the morning. - Coffee will make you feel good. - But she's upset. - Why? She knows you're here. - She's waiting for me. - I don't think so. - What do you mean? - What are you trying to tell me? - She's trying to help you. - She's not waiting? - Don't be a fool. She must be waiting. A fool... Tough luck. Now I know what it's all about. Here you go. I can do it. - I get it. - Control yourself, young man! Enough of the rubbish. Take me! Hurry UP! You're drunk. Get out of here. Leave right now! No one's going to rape you! - My parents are getting divorced. - Your mum is marrying that guy? No. But she's sick of all this and my old man because he's opposing her. I tried to make her change her mind, mentioned about this holiday resort... - My dad would go for it. - And? - They're getting a divorce anyway. - What about you? - I'll stay with my mother. - What about your finances? Did your parents think about it before they got married? My old man will be ruined. Mum gets to keep the house. She's smart. She's just reasonable. Have you seen Rena'? Will you talk to your father? No greenhouse, no progress. I could try. It's Volvo engine. I keep it hidden. I don't want your father to pick on me. Yeah... Did you have a good time? You could've told me that you were leaving Nieporqt! Do you know how I felt when I was looking for you? You made an impression you got on well with her. - I thought she was fascinated. - Especially in the end. It wasn't easy for me to leave. Your wife, now her... But I decided to do it for us. Not so quickly... Slowly... Relax. It's only necessary. Just imagine: you buy a newspaper, enter the club, smile... No! No sugar in your coffee. According to O'rubiec bitterness gives an extra refreshment. And in a few month we're leaving for a vacation. After you translate this, you'll be somebody. Commanding officer and commissioner. Commander, commissioner... Or rather the leader, chief... Commander is the best. A friend looked at a friend in silence. It's not natural and there's no need to repeat words. - Sorry? - You say 'friend' twice. - How should I put it then? - Make it lighter but meaningful. - Looked at each other? - One at another? One friend looked at another in silence... Or rather silently looked at each other. Whistling bombs are attacking the rocks... - Why rocks? - What do you mean? The text says 'rocks'! That's where the soldiers are hiding. The Germans surrounded the island. ...which means? They don't swing. Maybe write 'still' or 'unshakeably', 'motionless'. The enemy is 'trying'... ...or 'struggling'? - Wrong. - 'Trying hard'? - Not to the same side all the time. - What side? When you walk, you should make turns both to the left and to the right. Otherwise you'll feel dizzy. Prisoners do the same in their cells. - The enemy... - Your leg. - ...is trying to conquer the island. - You did it well this time. - Is trying?! - I'm talking about the turns. I know this thanks to Otubiec who used to penetrate margin of society. - What did you say at home? - That I'm going to a concert. To a congress. I'm changing the subject on purpose to give you time to relax. - And at the office? - I'm on leave. Great. You've got time to work then. The enemy intends to... - Well? - No... That makes no sense. Darling, you may feel too much tension right now. Let's go and lie down. Stop thinking about it. Come on. You don't know what's happening to me! I can't translate! Everything's going to be alright. You'll go to the editorial office in the morning give them what you've already translated and get next texts. Then we'll go on holiday. No need to worry. Everything's going to be fine. But I don't want to. I can't do it. You should rationalize it. That's how your personality is reacting. OJrubiec, on the contrary, was very focused although... - Well? - It's nothing, darling. - I don't care about OJrubiec! - Don't be silly. It's hard for you to stand out if you have a wife, a home and a child. Leave the child alone! Unfortunately, all that greatly influences personality. Get to work. I don't want to. I can't. It's a cock-and-bull story. Don't get hysterical. You'll rewrite it. The typist is waiting for you in the morning. They“ see you at Young Thoughts at 1 pm. You haven't got much time left then. But you'll be finished in a second. I'll meet you in the park tomorrow. You'll see me right after visiting the editorial office. We need to do this for us, darling. It's about this oversight, that's right. Yes, it was my complaint. No, I can't be wrong. That's not nice of you to suspect me of that. Not a 6 but an 8. Black, elastic tights size 8. YOUNG THOUGHTS, THE OFFICE - Who are you looking for? - For the head of prose. - Yes? - Is that you? - If that's alright with you. - So it's you. Yes. I brought my translations. I studied Russian literature... - I have it right here. - That's not bad. - Sorry? - Translations. Fine. Wait a second, are you Miss lrena's friend? Of course. That's me. It's about an island... Interesting... You look nice... not bad at all... Come in, young man. Come in. In you come. Sit down, please. - Am I interrupting? - Come in. We've won. They've promised to exchange the tights. That's my translation. I'm glad. Take the car. Check if they have something worth seeing. - Blue? - I hate blue. Beige. Let me see. No this. That. - Very nice tights. - Isn't it? For export. They're remarkable. But they got the sizes wrong. - Are they elastic? - Very much so! - You won't buy them anywhere. - What about Polish Bank? - They don't have it. - Can I go now? - Yes. - Thank you. Commander and Commissioner. Let's have a man-to-man conversation. It's like I was reading a homework. Not mentioning the poor style. 'The enemy intends to try to conquer the island'. It should be 'is trying' 'struggling'... Polish is such a difficult language. In addition you couldn't sense that sharpness, the brutality in the ballad about the difficult life of the soldiers. It's very average, correct at best. You felt no pressure doing it, right? The poem is not pulsating, it has no rhythm. Listen to the original. Can't you hear it? If a cucumber isn't singing, it means it can't. Don't worry. That's all. Send my love to Irena. She's a great girl. First of all, calm down. I know it's upsetting but that editor may not be competent. She didn't realize what you're worth. Second of all, you're talented. Your translations have many advantages, we'll return to them. - But now I've got another idea. - Shut up! - Excuse me? - Shut up. What's up with you, my dear? Calm down. Can't you see what's happening to me?! Sometimes we all have shaking hands. If you saw OJrubiec in the morning... I don't care about him. What have you done to me? - I had a life... It wasn't that bad. - Adjust your tie and primp your hair. See how temperamental and passionate you've become? - That's wonderful! - No! Telephone's ringing, Wmdek. Hello? Funny thing happened to me, darling. I must see you to tell you all about it. I think it's going to influence our matter. What wrong, darling? Why haven't you come to the park? I was waiting for 20 minutes. I have another great idea. What were you told in the editorial office? I see... Pity. But I guess that's the price of success. - Yes... - That editor may not be competent. She didn't realize what you're worth. History of literature shows it happens. - Sure! - You're talented. My new idea is fantastic. It's going to be huge, I know it. You'll become a sculptor. Darling? - I'd cut it like that. - Really? - That's too short. - It'll be fine. Too short at the back. Take a look. - Who was that? - Who? - It was for me. - I see. You look great, honey. Beautiful! - The three days worked miracles. - She's right. When you weren't at the conference. You weren't at home, I mean. I left home, too. - You know that. - I do. - Very nice. - What? - Your hair. - You don't like it? I was just saying I do. There must be something you want from me. It's great to be back. Can you remember that mosquito from TV? Yes. - What a proboscis. - You don't say. - What's the matter? - Goodnight. Goodnight, my boy. First wiggle your ears and we'll say goodnight. Wiggle then. That's amazing! I met some interesting people... ...who know how to take care of themselves. - They have their heads... - What? ...screwed on. Listen to me, your work is pointless. You know... You know Russian, you could be well off. You could be a translator, there's a great demand. I don't know... They... They told me they could enrol you in Writers Society, then... Then we could go for holiday at the Black Sea... There are writer's houses. My friend could get you in touch with that writer... No, no, no... Shut up! Wmdek!
