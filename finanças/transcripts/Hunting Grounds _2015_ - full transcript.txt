(silence) (whooshing) (zooming) (eerie music) (drum and gong music) (tinkling) (slow orchestral music) (dark piano music) (roaring) (crashing) (gun clicking) (eerie music) - Hello? (dramatic music) Hello? (fire crackling) (light drumming) Hey, are you hurt? (crashing) (shouting) (heavy footsteps plodding) (screaming) (roaring) (dramatic music) (bird chirping) (light orchestral music) - What are we doing here? - I need to give Will a call. - If you didn't get rid of our cell phones, you wouldn't have to stop at a pay phone. - Michael, I don't know how many times I'm need to say this to you but, we're broke. We can't afford to pay any unnecessary phone bills right now. Besides, there won't be a place up there to charge 'em anyway. - Yeah, but we would have saved on quarters. (light music) (clinking) I thought we were trying to save money. - Well, when Will comes to check on us, he's gonna wanna relax, so gonna have the essentials. (light orchestral music) (engine revving) - Right here. (dramatic music) (heavy piano music) (birds chirping) Where's the cabin? - Will said it's a few hundred yards that a way. Let's start gettin' the stuff unloaded. I don't want this to take all day. Here we go. That'll (mumbles). (heavy music) Well, this doesn't look so bad. (birds chirping) Which one of these opens the door? Thanks for labeling these, Will. (eerie music) (door squeaking) - What's going on? - Stay right here. (ominous music) - What do you think happened? - Looks like somebody ransacked the place. - You think they're still around? - No one else is in here. I'm gonna go check around back. You just stay right here. (eerie music) (crashing) (sighing) Whoever did this, they're gone now. Yeah, we gotta get this place cleaned up. I'm gonna head over to the truck and handle moving all the boxes in here and chop some firewood. You just take care of this mess. - What if they come back? - Your uncle said there hasn't been anybody up here in years. This could have happened a long time ago and no one's been here to see it. (laughing) You'll be all right. Well, better get a move on. Thanks for taking care of this. (door slamming) - (chuckling) Yeah, no problem. (light piano music) (door creaking) - Comin' through. That mess out there isn't gonna clean itself, Michael. Come on. (sighing) (birds chirping) (muffled rock music) (sweeping) (light piano music) (chopping) How's the house comin' along? - Good. (chopping) We got enough wood? - We could always use a little more. Want a go at it? - No. I was thinking about asking you if I could borrow the car. - What for? We brought everything we need. (chopping) - Yeah, uh, actually I wanted to see if maybe there was a college in the area or somewhere I could access online courses from in town. - Michael, I don't wanna get into another argument with you. (chopping) We talked about this before. - Did we? Because I remember bringing it up and you saying no without even listening to me. - We're down to the last of our savings. I can't afford to send you to school. But maybe if you'd gotten better grades, you know, a scholarship would be in the cards for ya. - I'm sorry I was distracted from my studies, but have you ever heard of this things called student loans? - And you'd need me to co-sign for your loans. And my credit's been god-awful since before the funeral. I can't afford to take on more debt. (chopping) - So, that's it? My life is gonna consist of living in a shanty and working a minimum wage job at some local feed store. - We're both gonna have to make do with what's been given to us. You're not the only one who's grieving. If you want the car, you can take it in town and look for job applications. 'Cause once I'm done repairing things around here, I'll be right there with you. - And, it's not like you could do both or anything. (chopping) - I'm gonna be busy making this place livable for quite some time. And I might not be making a paycheck, but my days are gonna be filled with work. - Never mind. I'm gonna go inside and wait for Uncle Will. - Well, you can't just do nothing all day. Why don't you, uh, clean up that back room so Sergio can have a place to sleep 'cause of his bad back. - Sergio's coming? - Yeah, him and Will are coming up this weekend together. - But him and Will aren't even friends. Why is he coming here? - 'Cause he's my friend and I haven't seen him in a long time. - I don't want him going into my room. He's just gonna get drunk and root through all my shit. - It's not your room, Michael. - You got any other buddies coming, Dad? You know, it's a good thing we moved to this new palatial estate so now all your friends can come visit us. (chopping) (heavy orchestral music) (knocking) - How are we supposed to get inside, if you're standing in the middle of the doorway? - Hey, Uncle. - Good to see you, Michael. Glad you're here. - Glad to be back. - How's it been so far? - Well, I mean, it's as good as it can be. You want something to drink? - Uh, no, thanks. - Sergio? - That's Mr. Guerrero to you. Where's Rog? - He's sleeping. - This early? - Everyone needs a nap once in a while, Marx. So, you gonna get him up or just stand there? - Dad (knocking), wake up. Will and Sergio are here. - Okay. (door creaking) - He should be out in a minute. (clattering) - Why don't you wake up the whole mountain, while you're at it? - Lay off, man. - [Sergio] Shut up just once, Marx. - You guys take down the shelves? - No, when we got here, this place was wrecked. Somebody took down the shelves and the table was knocked over. - Never had a problem with vandals up here before. - Yeah, they busted in through the front door. It won't even lock anymore. (eerie music) - If you don't tell me there are hoodlums around here. If they come back, can't even keep 'em out. - Calm down, I can fix the lock. - I'll be a lot calmer once we go, get my guns out of the car. - Guns, what do we need guns for? - So shit like this doesn't happen. - Okay, besides the mess, how are you guys likin' the place? - Uh, well, it's run on propane and there isn't even radio. I don't really know how anyone could like it. - Kids, never grateful for what they got. Always something to complain about. - Did your dad have a chance to check out those places in town I told him about? - No. He says he has to fix this place up before he can get a real job. (door creaking) - Hey Will, how's it going? - Doin' good, Roger. How you doin'? - Can't complain. - Dad, we'll need-- - Hey, who let a fuckin' Mexican in here (laughing)? - How's it goin' you old bastard? Long time no see, man. - Where's your stuff? - Left it out in the car. - Ah, how's the family? - Ah, you know how it is. My last weekend with Marty, the kid had the shits like you wouldn't believe. Didn't wanna stay inside either. Cleanin' streams of that stuff off the sidewalk. So, I give him a little what's for. The fuckin' landlord calls Child Services. Can you believe that bullshit? I got court with Sheila if I wanna see that kid again. - Who would have thought the courts would look down on child abuse like that? It's a strange world. - You can start talking about raising kids once you stop pumping iron every wakin' second and work on pumpin' some pussy. - Okay, Sergio, I opened up my second gym last month. In my experience, success is definitely something women respond to. Although I'm sure you know all about that, right? I'm sure they're just bustin' down your door after seeing your beefy list of debts. - Hey, listen you dick-- - Hey, I'm not gonna listen to this shit all weekend. Just knock it off, you two. - You mind if we take a look around the property? I wanna talk about a few things before we get too distracted. - Sure, just step outside. (door creaking) Everything looked good, for the most part. The place was busted up when we got here. - That's what Michael was tellin' me. We can always swing by the Sheriff's on the way back through town. - Ah, it's not that big of a deal. With Michael and I both working, we got it all cleaned up and everything up and running. - [Will] Glad to hear it. Let's go check around back. - [Roger] Sure. (birds chirping) - What the fuck is that? - That's an outhouse. There's no running water up here. - Fuck, Rog, I knew you had it bad, but not this bad. So, what's the story with this place, Marx? Family find it abandoned and claim it for themselves? - My grandfather built this place. We used to come up here for vacations. - [Sergio] I thought my vacations were bad. - Why didn't we ever come here, Dad? - Your mother didn't feel like making the trip up after your grandma died. - It's too bad you didn't spend a lot of time up here, Michael. Your mom really liked it when she was your age. She really loved the outdoors, seeing nature. - We all read the obituary, Marx, no need to rehash it. - Hey why don't you show some respect, all right? Shannon meant a lot to us. - Relax, dude, it was only a joke. - Yeah, well, no one thinks you're funny. (sad piano music) - [Will] You have enough wood? - [Roger] I think so. - All right, I guess all that needs to be done is to paint it and build the porch with the tools in the shed. - [Roger] Yeah, it shouldn't take me too long. - How are you doing for work? You been lookin'? - Ah, no, but I figured since I'm only fixin' things up around here, I can be looking for a job at the same time. - Can we do something else now? - Well, there's really not that much to do. - Are you kidding? There's tons of great stuff. In fact, there's supposed to be a meteor shower tonight. I figured we could find a good spot and watch it. - What? No fuckin' way. I brought booze. Roger, why don't you follow me down to the car, help unload the goods? Marx (fingers snapping), toss me your keys. - So, the plan for the weekend is to get drunk? - No, the plan for the weekend is to relax, Michael. (sad music) - Come on, I'm sure they're gonna wanna do more than just drink beer. (laughing) - Oh man, usually I'm the one doin' the fucking, but that night, I got fucked. (clattering) (laughing) - [Roger] Oh man. I'm so glad you came this weekend, man, it's been too long since I had a really good time. - Man, it worked out. You know I told you I was in the area for work. - Yeah. - I'm actually with a logging crew on this here mountain. - No shit. - Yeah. We're clearing all the woods around here starting at the top, working our way down. Hey, Mikey. (clattering) Come here. (muffled rock music) You wanna beer? - No thank you. - Come on. - Go ahead. - See, your old man doesn't care if you have a beer and we won't let anyone know you're under age. - Even if I could drink, I wouldn't. - What's wrong with your boy here, Rog? How about some (speaks in Spanish)? I got it from this guy Darby. Best shit in town. - Get out of my face. - Don't you fucking hit me. - Well, I think Michael and I might check out that meteor shower. - Fine with me. We're gonna smoke some of this shit. We don't need any little pussies around. When you decide to grow a pair, then you can sit at the man's table. Of course, I can't remember the last time a little bitch miraculously grew balls (laughing). - Go easy on the kid. - All right, all right, so sensitive. (gentle piano music) - [Michael] I knew this was gonna happen. - [Will] I know you don't like to drink, Michael, but your dad can make his own choices. - After the accident, he said that that was it. Clean living. He wasn't gonna let alcohol hurt our family anymore. That lasted, what, three weeks? - You have to understand, man, he was married to Shannon for 20 years. That's a hard thing to get over. - Yeah, it's terrible. Now, who's gonna make him dinner? - I know he doesn't show it, but I think deep down, he feels the exact same way you do. - No, no, this is how he's always wanted to act. You know, she was preventing him from being a lazy slob. And now he has the perfect excuse, "My wife's dead." - I hadn't talked to your dad in months before he called about the cabin. Is it really that bad? - My mom died in a hit-and-run. My dad drank himself out of work and out of our house. - Look, hey, I'm sorry. But today isn't how it's always gonna be. Have you looked at any colleges? - Yeah, Dad says that we can't afford college. But that's okay, 'cause, you know, I'll learn how to cook grits and hogtie squirrel and really that's all the learnin' you need around here. - You know, things have been going really well with the gym. I was thinking about maybe asking your dad about you moving in with me for awhile. There's schools around my place. You can hang out with kids your own age. Maybe we can even set up a student loan with my bank. - Really? - Yeah. Like I know, I know that things are never gonna be the same now that your mom's gone. But I want you to have as normal of a life as possible. - He'll never go for it. - Won't know until we ask. I'll ask him on the trip tomorrow. - What trip tomorrow? - Your dad didn't tell you? No, it's why Sergio brought all those guns for. It's huntin' season. Sure he wants to shoot some of the woodland creatures before he has to leave. - Great. - If he's not killing things one way, he's just gonna do it another. - What? - Sergio's crew, they're gonna be logging a lot of the mountain this side of Eight Canyons. It's really gonna mess with the wildlife around here. You know that great job he was telling your dad about? - Yeah. - It's bullshit. They got him watching the equipment at night. Any jackass can do his job. - So how'd he get the weekend off? - (laughing) He didn't. His dealer's watching it over the weekend. Stupid asshole's been pulling shit like this for decades. - I can't believe you've known him for that long. I don't know how you stand it. - You saw us back at the cabin, right? Well, I still can't stand it. Whenever him and Roger would come and visit Shannon after school, he used to just make it a point just to poke at me. I never thought in a million years I'd still be dealing with him now. - So, when's this thing supposed to start? - The guy said it should start any time now. - There it is. - Rise and shine (smooching)! (laughing) - What the hell is wrong with you? - Hurry up and eat or we'll leave your ass behind. Come on, let's go. Hey Rog, got more ammo? - [Roger] Uh, all I got is there. You look like the one who's hungover. - Yeah, well it's hard to sleep when you two won't shut up all night. You know, I don't really feel like going out today, Dad. I'm gonna stay. - Come on, Michael. You're complaining about there's nothing to do around here, so now we're finally doing something. - Okay, but can we do like, like target practice or something? I just don't really understand why we have to kill stuff. - Hunting happens to be a very fun sport, Michael. You'll see. Hurry up and eat. We gotta get going. (dark orchestral music) - Roger, find us a nice clear spot, yeah? - There's a place up ahead over there. - All right. (mumbling) (sighing) (crunching) - Hey, give me an Oreo. Okay. (crunching) (birds chirping) - Roger, hold still. - Guys. Get down. - That is a beauty. - Who gets it? - We'll let Michael get the first shot. - What am I supposed to do with this? - You're just gonna shoot the deer. - No, I don't wanna hunt. - Come on, be a man. - Do it for me, Michael. - No, Dad, take the gun, I don't want it. - Nope, I'm not gonna take the gun until you take the shot. - You're really gonna make him do something he doesn't wanna do? - Will, he's my son. I think this will be good for him. - Dad... - Your father's been looking forward to this, Michael. Now, stop being a pussy and do it. Don't touch me again. - [Roger] Quiet guys, you're gonna scare him away. Come on. Listen, you (mumbles) Get it in the cross hairs. You gotta let go of your breath, then pull the trigger. Pull. (gun firing) Ah, so close. - How do you fuck that up? Did you do that on purpose? - What are you doing? - I'm not gonna let it get away. (heavy breathing) - You know, Michael, something's gonna kill it eventually. - Yeah, but it doesn't have to be me. (snapping) (yelling) (eerie music) (grunting) (vomiting) (ominous music) (panting) - Whoa, whoa, what the, hey it's me. What's wrong with you? You look scared shitless. The deer do that to you? Those things can be pretty ferocious. (laughing) (thudding) - Let's take a break for a minute. - [Will] How many breaks are we gonna take today, Sergio? - What's that? - I don't know. - It almost looks like hair from a bear, but I've never seen one around here. (growling) - Is it a bear? - We have no bears around here. - It's the woods. Of course there's bears. - You work on this mountain, right? Have you ever seen a bear before? - No. - But what else makes noise like that? - I've never heard it before. - It's gotta be a bear. Maybe we should head back. - I've never seen a bear around here and I've been up in this area dozens of times. - Roger, just because you haven't seen something doesn't mean it doesn't exist. - Even if it was a bear, it's gonna keep its distance. They're not gonna do anything unless they're aggravated. - You see, so let's stick with the plan. We'll set up camp soon. We'll play it safe from here on out. - Well, I'm not taking any chances. - (chuckling) chances with what? The nice trail? - I gotta take a piss. - Now he's gonna scream bear every time he starts acting like a dick. Don't worry, we'll be right here for you when the bear gets you, all right? - [Sergio] One of these days I'm gonna shut you up, you little pissant. - You want one? - No thanks. (birds cawing) (crackling) - Hey Will, remember that thing we were gonna talk about? - So yeah, Roger. I wanna talk to you about something. (rustling) - Guys! (ominous music) - What is it? (rustling) (gun firing) Shit. (dramatic music) (gun firing) (thudding) (whimpering) (heavy breathing) - What are you doing? - Watch it, man. - What the fuck you shooting at? - It's down there. Do you see it? - What was it? - I don't know. It's down there. - Where down there? - Down to the bushes. - You hit something? Was it a bear? - No, it wasn't a bear. This was huge. - Have you ever seen a full-size bear before? - Not up close. - Well, then you don't know they can stand up to seven feet tall. - No, no, no, this was bigger. - Everything looks bigger when you're scared. The point is, did you kill it? - [Sergio] It don't think so. - Well, then we need to find out. - Hey, what are you doing? - Just stay up there with Michael, all right? I need to check this out. - Be careful, Dad. - I don't see anything. - We gotta get out of here, man. That thing is still out there. - What are we gonna do? - There's nothing down there. - There was. - Well then, it's invisible. All right, can you wait to go crazy until after this weekend? - What's going on, Sergio? - I don't know. I thought I saw... - It'll be okay. Let's just get back on the trail. We should set up camp. We're all tired and-- - Imagining things? - And it's getting dark, so let's find a nice place up ahead and relax. - We should head back to the cabin. It's not that far back. - Maybe he's right. We can't sleep out here with a hurt bear. - We've already concluded that there aren't any bears. So, Sergio freaked out and shot a bush, who hasn't? But, some of us should stop overreacting and start growing a pair. - You don't know what I saw. - Knock it off you two. We're all sane adults here. Let's just act like it. - So, we're still camping for the night? - Come on. - Come on, Michael. We'll find a good spot. (dramatic music) (growling) - [Roger] This looks good. - [Will] We're gonna need firewood. - [Roger] Michael, can you go get us some wood? - Yeah, I guess. Shouldn't we wait until the tent's set up? - There is no tent. - [Michael] What? What's gonna keep the animals out? - [Sergio] Oh Jesus, we should have brought the tent. - There is no tent and nothing's gonna bother us. - But Dad-- - Michael, you're just gonna have to get comfortable on the ground, okay? So, please go get the wood. (ominous music) (snapping) (snapping) (drumming) - [Michael] Jesus Christ. - Don't go all Sergio on me, man. Come on. (fire crackling) (howling) - Calm down, will ya? - What's got you so freaked? - I don't know. It's about three feet taller than me, completely covered in hair. I'd never seen anything like that before. - Maybe it was Sasquatch. - Don't be ridiculous. Come on. - I don't know what else it could have been. - Are you serious? You think you shot at a Big Foot? - No, he's not serious. He's being very stupid right now. - No, that's the only explanation that makes sense. - That's the only explanation that makes sense? - That thing is still out there. And there are probably more of them. We gotta go back. - Calm down, man. Just relax, all right? There's no such thing as Big Foot. - I don't know, I've heard stories. - [Sergio] What stories? - Knock it off, Will. - What did you hear? - Stories of strange things being seen in the woods. I heard them when I was a kid. There's even one about a group of miners that were attacked on this very mountain. - Will, this isn't funny. - Keep going. - Now, it's gonna scare Michael. - I'm not scared. Go ahead, Will. - All right. It happened about 90 years ago. There was a group of miners working on this mountain. One night, they were attacked in their cabin. Rocks, they fell from the hilltops. The sides of the cabin they were just being shaken violently. The attacks happened throughout the rest of the night. At one point, one of the men ventured outside and went around back, was knocked unconscious by a rock. And when he came to, everyone was gone. But there were these big footprints all around the cabin. Ever since then people referred to it as Ape Canyon. It's only a few miles away. Pretty short walk for our friend Mr. Sasquatch. - [Sergio] That's true? - No, it's not true. He's yanking your dick, man. - [Sergio] We shouldn't be here. - Come on, Sergio. Even if Big Foot did exist, he's not gonna attack people, all right? He's friendly like ET. - I don't know, Dad. Maybe he felt threatened. - Michael, shut up, all right? This stops right now. - No, we gotta stay alert tonight. What if they come back for us? - Don't worry, all right? We got our guns, you got your knife, Michael's afraid of every sound he hears. I mean, that's a pretty good security system. All we have to do is hang the food up in the tree then nothing has any reason to bother us. - Yeah. Okay. (eerie music) (crackling) (drumming music) (crackling) (heavy breathing) (low growling) (screaming) (gun firing) - What the hell's going on? - [Sergio] It's the Big Foot. I told you it would come after me. - Fuck, Sergio, come back. Stay here with him. - Did you see anything? - Sergio was right. It was Big Foot. - What? No, damn it, Michael, that's the story I saw on Unsolved Mysteries. - I saw it, Will. Someone's, someone's been here. - Oh, God, Sergio's crazy ass must have scared him off. Come on, we gotta go find 'em. (generator humming) - [Sergio] Darby! Darby! Darby. - [Roger] What's going on, Sergio? - [Sergio] Darby's supposed to be here. - Who the hell is Darby? - This guy from the town. I had him watching the equipment for me this weekend. - [Will] He said it was his dealer. - [Roger] Fuck. Did you tell him we'd be camping? - [Sergio] Well, yeah. - [Roger] Don't you see what's going on here? He's the one from back at the campsite. He was trying to steal our shit. And he might have been the one that fucked up the cabin. - [Sergio] No, no, no, no, no. They were here. (dramatic music) They killed him. All that blood. - [Roger] What the hell are you talking about? I'm gonna go find this guy and put an end to this. - [Michael] Dad. - [Roger] Stay with your uncle. There's no one here. - [Sergio] He got him. - [Roger] Enough of that. (eerie music) Hey, who's there? (screaming) - [Will] Oh my God. - [Michael] Dad. - [Roger] Help me. - [Michael] Dad. (dramatic drumming music) - [Roger] Help me. - Dad! Dad! - No. What was that? - That was Big Foot. It won't stop until it kills us all. - Sergio, for fuck sake, someone just took Roger. We gotta find him. - NO, no, fuck you, I'm going back to the cabin. - Come back here, coward. Come on, we gotta go find your dad. - I saw it. I really did and it's gonna kill him. - All right, I know you're scared, Michael. But someone's gotta help him. And right now that's us. - I can't. - Okay, okay. Let's figure out what to do back at the cabin, all right? All right? Come on, come on! (footsteps plodding) (heavy breathing) - It couldn't have gotten in front of-- - There's more than one. (cracking) Shit! (dramatic music) (growling) - [Will] Come on, Michael. (heavy breathing) - [Michael] You got us lost. - [Sergio] I think it's this way. Let's just keep moving. (heavy breathing) (gasping) (crackling) (drumming music) (clattering) - [Will] Open up this (mumbles), you son of a bitch. (heavy breathing) (door clattering) (heavy breathing) (clicking) - Shit, we left the packs outside. - My dad's still out there. - The extra ammo's in the packs. - I thought he was your friend. - Well, that doesn't matter any more, Michael, because he's dead and we will be too without any fucking ammo. - Then why don't you go get it, Sergio? Okay, and hopefully we'll remember to let you back in. (punching) (grunting) - What the fuck is the matter with you? You don't fucking touch him. - Stay back, Mother Fucker. I'm tired of listening to your shit. - My shit? You're the one crying about coming back to this cabin as soon as possible and now you're gonna bitch about, what, not having bullets? - Guys. Well, what are we gonna do? - We stay here. - What? - Yeah, and we got an advantage over those things outside as long as we stay in the cabin. - But, what are we gonna do about my dad? - Yeah, we have to find Roger. - You don't have any idea where he is. - Then we, we take the cars. We go back to town, we come back with the cops. Michael, I need the truck keys. - I think my dad has them. - Oh shit. - Sergio (fingers snapping), keys. We need to find Roger. Who knows what those crazy fuckers are doing to him. - Oh man, Roger's dead. He's being ripped apart by Big Foot as we speak. - I'm tired of your bullshit. You're gonna give me those keys, or do I have to take them from you? - Back off! (eerie music) - You wanna stay here? Fine. We'll take a car. We'll come back with help. - You'll lead 'em back here, you'll lead 'em back to me. - Give me the keys! (punching) (grunting) (slashing) (grunting) (slashing) - [Will] Oh God. (clattering) (heavy breathing) (eerie music) - You killed him. - I gotta get rid of him. I can't have him staring at me all night long. Pick him up. - What? - You're gonna move the body, put him in your room. - No. - Stop fucking looking at me! Fuck you, fuck you. (clacking) (grunting) (clattering) (crying) (clattering) (heavy breathing) (door creaking) (thudding) (gasping) - Oh shit! (heavy breathing) - Help me. - úWhat do you want? - Look, my name is Bauman. I haven't eaten in days. Please help me. - Okay. Sit down. And put your hands on the table and don't move. - Okay. Thank you. Thank you. - Oh Jesus, what's happened to you? - I was kidnapped. I don't know if they're still after me or not. - The Big Foot? It took my dad tonight. Okay, you, you have to tell me what happened to you so I can try and find him. - All right. For years, I'd heard a story about a lost gold mine out in these mountains. When I heard they were gonna start logging, I knew somebody would find it eventually. I needed the money, so I scrounged together whatever I could, made my way out to the mountains. That night, started to hear strange noises in the trees. I found an abandoned campsite. That's where it happened. (growling) (footsteps plodding) But when I couldn't escape its grasp, it carried me for what felt like hours. (growling) (grunting) (growling) (yelling) (pounding) (grunting) (heavy breathing) - Oh, no! No! No, no! (grunting) (eerie music) (heavy breathing) (chirping) (crunching) (shouting) (growling) (screaming) I saw three of 'em in that cave. Could have been more. I don't know. I didn't try to move again until the sun came up. (heavy breathing) (rocks clattering) (growling) (pounding) I'm not sure why they didn't try to kill me. Maybe I wasn't a threat. Maybe they didn't want me to escape and bring back more people, I don't know. I sat there for I don't know how long. Watching 'em go about their routine. Then two of them left. That left me with just the one. I knew if I was ever gonna escape, it had to be now. I didn't have anything to use as a weapon on me. But I did have some tobacco. - Hey. Hey Boogie Man. Mmm. Good. Want some? (grunting) (slobbering) (growling) (thudding) (dramatic music) (thudding) (grunting) (dramatic drumming music) I had no idea where I was so I just ran. I don't know for how long. (heavy breathing) Then eventually I saw your cabin. - But, where's the cave? Okay, you have to tell me where the cave is 'cause that's where they're holding my dad. - I'm sorry, I don't know. When I got out of there, I just ran in whatever direction I was pointed. Hey, was that an outhouse I saw out back? - Yeah. - You got a gun or anything? - No. - Will you come with me? You can keep an eye out. We gotta watch each other's backs. - Okay. (ominous music) (crunching) - Hey. Can I have that? - I thought I was watchin' your back? - I don't like the dark. (grunting) - Okay. (shouting) (grunting) - Dad, Dad, what happened? - [Bauman] Oh shit. (grunting) - Oh. - Are you okay? (grunting) Are you okay? - It pulled me into the woods. They beat me. It messed up my leg. I had to play dead before it would (mumbles). - What happened to your gun? - (mumbles) outside before I saw you. - We're gonna need that gun if those things come back here. (heavy breathing) (grunting) - Ah. Thank God you're okay. And who the hell was that guy? - That's Bauman. The Big Foot had him too. - Where's everyone else? - Will and Sergio were arguing over whether we should stay here or we should go and Will tried to take his keys back and Sergio stabbed him. - Oh my God. - And it's my fault because Will wanted to go and find you and I told him not to because I was too scared. And now it's my fault that he's dead. - No, no, what happened was not your fault, Michael. I would have told Will to do the same exact thing if I could. The entire time I was out there, I prayed that you were safe. Where's Sergio now? - I knocked him out and put him in my room with Will's body. - Well, we'll just leave him in there then. When Bauman gets back, we're gonna go and we're gonna get some help. - Okay. Do you think we can make it to the car? - We got no choice. Where are my keys? - I don't know. - I must have dropped them in the shed. (grunting) - [Michael] Come on, come on. - I can't go. - We're gonna get the key and the gun and we're gonna get the fuck out of here, okay? - Oh my God, they followed me. (dramatic music) (gun firing) (yelling) (growling) (clicking) (growling) (screaming) (screaming) (growling) (screaming) (cracking) (screaming) (grunting) (clacking) (gun firing) (thudding) (growling) - What are you doing? He's still out there. - I'm sorry, Michael, he's dead. We have to look out for each other now. - But it left. - We don't know where to. We have to be smart about this, Michael, or we may not last through the night. (thudding) What was that? (heaving breathing) (door creaking) (door creaking) (thudding) (glass shattering) (grunting) Stay down. (thudding) (clattering) Shit. - Think they thrown a rock? (crunching) (heavy breathing) (crunching) (heavy breathing) What is it? - They're leaving. - Well, then we should leave too. (footsteps plodding) (creaking) (glass shattering) - Pay back time, you bastards. (gun firing) Michael, grab a gun, help me. - It's locked in the room with Sergio. (crashing) - Oh shit! (gun firing) (dramatic drumming music) (heavy breathing) (low creaking) - What are they doing? - It sounds like they're pushing on the walls. (clattering) - Over there. (gun firing) (dramatic music) (growling) - Dad! (yelling) (thudding) (grunting) - Come on. Gotta block the window. Are you okay? - Yeah. (creaking) - They're on the roof. Get down. (clicking) (creaking) (gun firing) (gun firing) (gun firing) (creaking) - Did you get it? (crashing) (dramatic music) (slashing) (growling) (slashing) (growling) (slashing) (grunting) (roaring) (growling) (grunting) - [Roger] Grab the dresser from your room. We can use it to hold the door. - Sergio's in there. - We don't have a choice. We can't hold this ourselves. Go! (grunting) (shouting) - You need something, Michael? (grunting) - [Roger] Michael, hurry! - Rog? (grunting) Come on. (shouting) (roaring) (grunting) (crashing) (gun firing) - Thanks. - Yeah, no problem. - We gotta get to the cars. - No way. Those things are still out there. You want them to kill us all? - Okay, maybe you're right. - If we're gonna stay here, then we need to block these windows. - With what? - With the wood for the deck. With the wood for the deck that's in the shed. - Yeah, he's right, Sergio. If we can get that stuff, we can keep these bastards out for good. - I'm not going out there. The cabin is the only place we're gonna be safe. - Well, they're hurt pretty bad, we got all the main entrances blocked. And we don't hear them outside anymore, do you? Maybe they're regrouping in the trees. We can't secure this cabin unless we get that wood. - Well, I'm not leaving. And you're gonna go out there with that bad leg? Well, are you? - I'll go. - Are you sure? - Sergio's right. We have to stay here. Okay, which means that the only option is to lock this place down. - Well, you can take your daddy's rifle. I'm keeping mine right close. - Take it. - No, because I need to have my hands free to carry stuff. Okay? But that means I'm gonna need one of you in that window. - I'll cover you. - Thanks, Dad. Okay, let's use my window. - All right. Well, no time like the present. (clattering) - Be careful. - Don't worry, we will. (heavy breathing) (grunting) (heavy breathing) (eerie music) (footsteps pounding) (heavy breathing) (clattering) (yelling) (drumming music) (heavy breathing) (crunching) - [Roger] Oh no. Michael, look out. (crashing) - [Michael] No, don't shoot. (growling) Dad, open the door. - Sergio. - Yeah? - I need your help. Get on the dresser. We just need to make a distraction. - All right. (glass shattering) (heavy breathing) Jesus! (gun firing) - Ah! (crunching) - You don't hurt my family, Sergio. (coughing) (dramatic music) (heavy breathing) (tapping) Hey, over here. This is the one you want. (gun firing) (grunting) (crunching) (screaming) - [Sergio] Roger! (growling) (crunching) (yelling) (squirting) (heavy breathing) (knocking) - [Michael] Dad! - Thank God. Never been more afraid in my whole life. You got the key? - Yeah. Where's Sergio? - He got what's coming to him. Now, let's get the hell out of here. (crunching) Stay right here. (door creaking) (growling) Get the gun. Go. (grunting) (drumming music) (grunting) I won't be able to make it on my leg. Just go. - I'm not gonna leave you here, Dad Come on, come on, come on. (grunting) Oh no. (grunting) (eerie music) (heavy breathing) (grunting) Where'd he go? Come on. (grunting) (drumming music) (yelling) (roaring) (screaming) (slapping) (growling) (roaring) (crunching) (grunting) (growling) - [Michael] Dad! - [Roger] Go. Get to the car. (dramatic music) (heavy breathing) Give me the key. (grunting) (eerie music) (growling) - [Michael] Dad, watch out! (grunting) Dad! (yelling) (thudding) (grunting) (grunting) (heavy breathing) (light piano music) - [Michael] Come on, Dad. (grunting) (low growling) We're leaving and we're not coming back. (low growling) (door slamming) (engine starting) (light piano music) - Are you okay, Dad? - I'm okay. (grunting) Oh, shit. - I'll get you to the hospital. Okay, you're gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. (tires crunching) (wind blowing) (light orchestral music) (moving into dramatic music) (eerie music)
