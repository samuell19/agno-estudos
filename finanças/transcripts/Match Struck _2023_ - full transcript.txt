[MEDICAL PREP] [MEDICAL PREP CONTINUES] DOCTOR: Hey, Jo. Well, I know you and I've been through this before, and it's not the result we want to hear again. But this pregnancy was unsuccessful, and I'm sorry. JO: I-It's okay. Is your husband coming today? Um, no, he's not able to make it. DOCTOR: Okay. All right. You know, these conversations are tough to have. And after this many failed pregnancy attempts to worry about your health and safety is our number one job, and at this point, I think it really is viable to start thinking of some other options for children, adoption or foster care, or.. Would it, would it just be safe I mean, is it safe if I just get back on birth control? Do I need birth control? Yeah. After this procedure, it'll be appropriate to get back on it. We'll set that up for you. That would be great. and I know you've been through this procedure before, but at this point, do you have any questions for me whatsoever? JO: No DOCTOR: Okay. So we're, we're good? DOCTOR: Yeah. I'll have the staff take care of everything else for you. Okay. Thank you. DOCTOR: Mm hmm. [SIGHS] Hey, one more thing. Would you mind signing this book for me?

[FRIGHTENED BREATHING] [MUSIC CONTINUES] MALE RADIO HOST: Recommended Minds, the bestselling novel currently being adapted into a major motion picture is sweeping up readers all over the world, leaving us asking, Who is this author Josephine Taylor? And where has she been? SECOND MALE RADIO HOST: The protagonist in "Recommended Minds" is one of the most phenomenal fictional female characters I've ever read. But there is a sadness that Taylor has in her previous essays and published work, an ominous force looming over this novel as you read it. FEMALE RADIO HOST: "Snare" was an attempt to make this good girl of literature bad. Like a child Disney star growing up and doing porn. SECOND FEMALE RADIO HOST: "Snare" is the worst book I have ever read. I-it-it was so bad that it became something I needed other people to read. MALE RADIO HOST: Josephine Taylor, a name you probably haven't heard in a long time. She was the author of Smash Hit, "Recommended Minds", but more recently she wrote "Snare", a critical flop that almost destroyed her career. Well, according to her, literary agent, Josephine Taylor has started on a new novel. And while we don't know much about it, we can assume this. If it's anything like Taylor's previous novels, it will be bold. [MUSIC CONTINUES] [MUSIC ENDS] [FLOWING WATER] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [FOOTSTEPS] Hmm [DEEP EXHALE] ANDREW: Hey, goodmornin' how you doing?

[SWELLING EMOTIONAL MUSIC] [MUSIC CONTINUES] JO [VO]: The pain in his chest was excruciating, as if bolts of lightning continually struck his heart. His eyes burned and his head ached. His wife, who dedicated her life to him, was the last one to touch him. She carried him to the bathroom. Her face flashed in and out of his vision, each time, causing more pain. She looked frightened and confused. But this did not concern him. Her feelings were never considered. In the final moments of Edmund's life. It would not be his scared daughter or how life with him had beaten his wife's beautiful face, leaving her haggard and unshapely. No, he only felt outrage for a life that was purloin from him. He saw the perverse setup of failure called existence. [DRAMATIC MUSIC SWELLS] He knew only ugliness as he and death became one. [DOORBELL RINGS] Hi, SOFIA: This must be your husband's. Actually, it's mine. I'm Jo. SOFIA: Sofia. I live next door. Oh, thanks. SOFIA: Sorry, I just. It's not a big deal or anything, but you should know the house has very strict upkeep rules.

MELISSA: Jo. JO: Hold on. Hold on. [ENDS CALL] [REMOTE CLICKS] TV HOST: This is the close up with Danny Peterson with a third novel set to hit bookstores very soon. I sat down with Josephine Taylor, whose first novel was turned into an award winning film. Josephine, such a pleasure. All right, tell me, what prompted the move from New York City to Cape Cod? Um, we were considering a family. Oh, children. Any luck? No. TV HOST: Do you have a title for your new novel? Um, I do, but uh I guess, um, I'm not allowed to share at this time. So you're going to leave us in suspense? All right. Well, I have to tell you, I love "Recommended Minds". It was very inspiring, very refreshing, very different from "Snares". So can you tell me why you went so dark? Um, [CLEARS THROAT] It was, um, just the story that I needed to tell at a particular time in my life. So are we supposed to feel sorry for the protagonists? I mean, that always confused me. Like, is a woman like that even redeemable? [REMOTE CLICKS] [SIGHS] [ATONAL MUSIC PLAYS] [MUSIC CONTINUES] THERAPIST: So, Jo, last time we spoke, you were rather angry. How have you been handling how you been handling your anger? I fucking hate everything. I hate everything. I know that's why I'm here. I know that's why I've been in therapy, and I just don't- I just don't know if I should continue. What about the drinking? Have you had anything to drink today? Mhm [SNIFFLES] I'm drinking every day. How's that working for you? Well, besides the headache I'm battling. It's going pretty well for me. How's the book going? JO: It's, um. It's coming along. I should have it finished soon, and... I'll have it done. I don't know. THERAPIST: That's good progress from last time. [EMOTIONAL MUSIC PLAYS] THERAPIST: So how about the characters in your novel? Do you identify with anyone in particular? [MUSIC INTENSIFIES] JO [VO]: The Grand Home is filled with aromas of garlic, fennel, and hot, bubbling tomato sauce prepared by Helena for her family. Sabrina, their maid, assists like she does most nights. They exchange a look of joy and satisfaction as they serve dinner at the family table. Franny, just shy of her 14th birthday, is a quiet girl. Her eyes a bit hollow and reluctant to show emotion. If any, it's towards Helena. Edmund attempts a joke of grandeur: "You and your mother will be the end of me." Only it falls flat. He feels it. He once was a different type of man. But for now, he will push those thoughts out. [FOOTSTEPS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC SWELLS] EDMUND: We finalizes a merger. Once the FTC gives us the green light with the capital, we can close on the largest development sight this side of the Mississippi. [CHUCKLES] [PAGES FLIP] HELENA: And you trust Claude right? What do you say that? Of course. HELENA: It's just, trust is hard for you. [JEWELRY CLINKS IN DISH] The past is the past. We're moving on No sense and talking about what's behind us. Three feet of bullshit [DRAMATIC MUISC PLAYS] [SHOWER SPLASHES] JO [VO]: Edmond's skin is balmy. He showers to wash off the gummed wetness clinging to a silk pajamas. No amounts of soap can scrub off his irritation, mostly by Helena and her questions, her questioning of him. This is, however, the biggest business deal, an accomplishment of his life. Her questions seem frivolous.

She is stressed and scattered. She instantly feels pulled apart, as if each woman was a drop of water from her own soul. How she longs to be unified in her own self. If she could only integrate all these shattered pieces, she could be free. HELENA: Oh gosh. Sorry. Forgive me. Hi, I'm Helena. Stephen. HELENA: Nice to meet you. STEPHEN: Nice to meet you. [EXHALES DRAMATICALLY] Thank you so much for coming today. No, my pleasure. I do have some experience with this shelter. Given my work with the family law in the county. JO [VO]: Stephen, a highly respected family therapist, agrees to help Helena with the woman shelter. The last year of his life has been filled with isolation, loathing and regret. He hasn't felt like himself, as if icy, cold, foreign hands pull and weave unnatural thoughts in his brain. But at this moment with her, he can no longer feel their presence. A long awaited, though, brief reprieve. Well, it's been a while since I've done something like this. I'm embarrassed to admit that. HELENA: Oh, you shouldn't be. I'm happy to get involved. [PIANO MUSIC PLAYS SOFTLY] Um, my parents adopted my sister and was very similar to these women and their children. STEPHEN: How old was she when she... HELENA: She was six. Her biological mom took her to church and then after Mass just asked her to wait. She never came back for her. I can see why you'd be passionate about this. HELENA: I mean, I'm-I'm hoping that I can make other people passionate about this, too. [DOOR SHUTS] [LIGHTER FLICKERS] [WATER FLOWING IN THE DISTANCE] [FOOTSTEPS] Oh shit. [WOOD THUDDING] Oh shit!

Maybe don't get her cigarettes next time. I gotcha. Did she talk? JO: She was starting to talk until uh, Hooters came barreling around the corner. She's a good woman and the only mom Olivia has. Sorry. It's okay. One of those days, huh? JO: Hey, um, since we're neighbors and all, and I'm supposed to be making friends.

[SNIFFLES] JO: So whenever I try to talk to him about anything or like talk about the miscarriage or... bring anything up, it just gets, turned back around on me. I'm just...I'm just really unhappy. [SOBS] So do you think that you want to try again to have children? JO: Fuck no, I don't want any fucking kids. I didn't even care when I lost the baby. I didn't even fucking care. I'd be a fucking terrible mother. I'm selfish. I'm, [SNIFFLES] I have a, obviously, a drinking problem. And...I have n-no self-control left in me anymore. But, for some reason, like... ...fuck it, I don't fucking care. I'm. You know what? I-I-I don't fucking care. Fuck Andrew. [BIRDS CHIRPING] JO [VO]: As a drop in sounds increased, Edmund's frustration grew. His behavior became erratic. His fear enveloped him. And he could not tell Helena the truth. If he doesn't close this business deal, they will lose everything. And to Edmund, poverty is the most detestable trait. Edmund has always been a drinker, but of late he needs more to slow the freezing sharp blades at course through his veins. He is queasy with this alien sickness swimming in his stomach. The drinking dulls the sensation. WOMAN: Franny, can you come here a moment, please? Want to take a look at the chorus? [CELLPHONE VIBRATES] [CELLPHONE VIBRATES] [CELLPHONE VIBRATES] [CELLPHONE VIBRATES] [SUSPENSEFUL VIOLIN MUSIC PLAYS] [SUSPENSEFUL VIOLIN MUSIC INTENSIFIES] JO [VO]: With the news of his business deal reaching culmination, a manic sense of safety takes over. He thinks it's hope, even relief. His body rejoices as the internal fireworks pop and implode with bright bursts of light. The band marches with horns blasting, all for him. This is a nudge from life that he is indeed impervious to failure. He is a God. [MUSIC FADES] But to his family he is frightening. And the word that lingers on all of their tongues but know they cannot utter, is crazy. Edmund is crazy. CLAUDE: This place is nuts. It's very large. Nothing like your place on the Upper East Side.

Like, the harder it is for me to actually just, like, do what's best for me. Hmm. You know, I get that. Sometimes, doing the right thing seems in conflict with being true to yourself. Yeah. Especially like in marriage. Like, I've made a ton of mistakes, but I definitely made a mistake in my marriage. I should have never. I don't know if I should never, but I told him something.

You know what he did to me? He cornered me. He came up on me all moaning and groaning and sweating. Pulls his thing out, comes all over me. And all he does is just stand there and look at me like he's gonna take a picture and and look at it later. That's not on me. When he died, you know what I did? I spit in his coffin. Men never stop hurting me. So I just never stopped drinking [CRIES] NO! It's not ok. it's not ok. [SOBS] And it just keeps happening. No matter what I do. [CRIES] CANDICE: Can you get her some water?

I used every fucking dollar I had to hassle from my first novel and it's all in his business. And I don't...My name is not even on it. I don't have anything. Like everything that you see, Everything.

CLAUDE: The fucking payout you authorized for yourself last night. Uh-Uh... I didn't. CLAUDE: I didn't either But this... This is fucking over for you. What exactly are you planning to do? Steal from me and the investors just walk? I would never steal. Steal? Who told you that? [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Was it a guy in-in-in-in a blue Corvette? Uh wha-whatever he says, it's a lie.

This house frightens her. Things move in this house, especially at night. She thinks about how her hair moves when a gentle breeze or a powerful wind rushes across her. How funny a part of our own being moves without our will. Maybe we, she thinks, humans move in the same way, [MUSIC CONTINUES] puppeted by unseen winds, deliberately making us dance, sing, and then of course, do all of the things we deem wicked. What an evil gust should exist in this house. [MUSIC CONTINUES] [MELANCHOLY MUSIC] [MUSIC FADES] EDMUND: Where is she off? HELENA: She's going to Germany It's her son's birthday. That's all she's been talking about for months. How could you not remember that? Hmm. Where are you going? Um...I have uh meeting with Claude, and then I just need to be on the worksite for just a bit. But you need to get some rest. Oh-oh, I-I'll feel better. Thanks to you. [SIGHS] Don't go. I know. I know I've been a lot lately, but [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] once the merger is done, we can go away. Just you and me. HELENA: Okay EDMUND: Somewhere tropical... Okay. Exotic, Croatia. Okay, okay. I-I'm just going to be gone a bit, all right? And then we'll have a nice family dinner. By the way, before you go, have you seen my ring? No. I-I can't seem to find it. I'm-I'm sure it's around here somewhere. You think it slipped off? No, no, it's here. It's here. Just go look. You'll find it and I'll be home soon, okay? Okay. [MELANCHOLY MUSIC] JO [VO]: Edmund feels the silence as it permeates his home. It's upsetting. Frightening. The absence of sound. The longer each quiet moment stretches, Edmund's agony expands and the forlorn whispers of truth pierce his skin. He's queasy with clarity, so he thinks to deafen the silence. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] It's the unknown man, the man who carries other people's secrets, who follows men watching. It's that maid, the impoverished woman his wife picked up off the streets. Her filth is in his house, and it is her who stole his ring. None of this, he tells himself over and over again, is his fault. [DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES] It's the uninvited visitor in his head whose name he can't see. "Who are you?" He asks. [MUSIC CONTINUES] Shit. We did it. [LAUGHING] Fucking did it. Oh God. Whew, okay. [DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES] Ah, I fucking did it. [CHUCKLING] [SIGHS] ANDREW: Yeah. Oh, that's great. Absolutely. Hold off a second. ANDREW: Hey, babe. JO: Hi ANDREW: Yeah, I'm about to sit down and eat dinner now. Just make sure you send the site plan by morning. Alright, perfect. This looks amazing. [PLATES CLINKING] ANDREW: Uh, I see you looking civilized tonight. Civilized? You look good. I finished. You finished what? My story... the novel. Jo. That's great. It's good to hear you worked hard on it. Is it any good? What, this? ANDREW: No, silly. Your novel. Can I-Can I get some wine, please? I'd like some wine. What's the matter, Jo? JO: Oh, yeah, everything's good. I just want some wine. Okay. [WHISPERS] Fucking good. [FOOTSTEPS DESCENDING] ANDREW: You know I'll wanna read it, right? What? ANDREW: I wanna read your novel. You don't read. ANDREW: Well, maybe I'll make an exception. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Melissa, know you're done? [SIGHS] ANDREW: Are you sure you're alright? Yeah. Just tired. [CORK POPS OPEN] Oh my God. What the fuck is that? That's like the cheapest bottle of wine we have. You can't even swing a good bottle for me. Hell, no. I'm not bringing up any of that good shit. Not for this. You already tipsy, look at you. Oh, I'm tipsy? Am I civilized now? Am fucking civilized for you? Is it ever fucking enough for you? [SLAMS PLATE] Tipsy my ass. [FOOTSTEPS DESCEND] [SIGHS] [DOOR SLAMS] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [CAR ENGINE RUNNING] BRENT: Hey. JO: Hello. I know it's a safe neighborhood, but it's a little late. [JO CHUCKLING] JO: D-Does that work? [BRENT CHUCKLES] What is this? Your? Your wife's car? BRENT: Hmm... JO: The child bride? Okay. Okay, okay. Ah okay. [CLEARS THROAT] Can I have one of those, please. JO: One of these? BRENT: Mhm. Oh, I thought you were a doctor. [SHARP EXHALE] Thank you. [SIGHS] So I have to light it for you too? BRENT: Sure. JO: Wait. That's funny, because I can't find my lighter. BRENT: Just give me your cigarette. Oh, wow. Look at you. Thank you. Thank you. Oh. Oh. Oh, boy. [SIGHS] So I'm having this... party. BRENT: Mhm. [CHUCKLES] Um...You and um...should come. Do you drink every day? Yes. I'd love to. Love to drink every day? Yeah. And come to the party. Okay. It'll be amazing. Deal. What are you doing out so late? Mm...just going for a little drive. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] Why don't we go? You could get in here pretty hard. [SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING CAR] Thank you for the cup. Yeah. [SIGHS] Let's get out of here, okay? Let's go. [OMINOUS MUSIC] JO [VO]: Every night since Edmund heard the first drip, he felt the cold, reptilian presence of the unknown person. A faceless thing in his mind and body. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] The face isn't formed, but to look at it too long, he feared, would it race him? This dream was filled with manifestos of entering a new realm. Leaving this dimension. Drip, drip. [DRAMATIC BASS] He sees his twin separated by lifetimes, lost in the shadows of a mirror image of himself. Wait, he thinks [MUSIC CONTINUES] he understands his twin is the faceless thing. He struggles to finish the thought it gives him geometrical puzzles to solve during his waking hours. A liaison between here and the next plane. [OMINOUS LAUGHTER] It's she. Or is she here as he? As one? I'm afraid she might let me fall from this ladder. Suspended at the tip of this endless night. I'll become the shadow. I hear them now I see them. I'm in the void. [SOFT ROCK AT PARTY] [BACKGROUND CHATTER] MELISSA: I am so thrilled. Look, I mean, all these people here for you. JO: Yeah, I know. It's, it's... MELISSA: See? Ah, this is amazing. MELISSA: I'm so proud of her. ANDREW: She deserves it. ANDREW: Well, she definitely deserves it. MELISSA: Yeah. It's time. She worked super hard. You excited? Um I'm so... MELISSA: Moving up. I am so excited. MELISSA: Okay. Oh, we have guests. C'mon, let's greet them. MELISSA: Okay. ANDREW: See you in a bit Melissa. [SOFT ROCK OVER SPEAKERS] JO: Hello, welcome. WOMAN: Oh my God.
