Okay. I got it. Model number DMC-FZ10 with a zoom. And E-TTL flash. Write it down for me, okay? And how long before this camera becomes as obsolete as the one I bought you three years ago? Three years. But by then I'll be 21. I won't be celebrating it with you. Thanks a lot. I wasn't finished with that. Sorry. Will you put him in his coat, please? [GIGGLES] Big boy. [***] Jess! I'm showing a loft downtown. Can I get anything for Sara's birthday? Got it under control. I'm keeping it simple. Okay. How was your sister's wedding? Oh, I cried. I always cry at weddings, including my own. Maybe I knew how the marriage would turn out. I guess everyone needs one to learn on these days. Hey, Jake. Hi. How about I pick up Sara's cake? Loft's next door to a great bakery. Chocolate on chocolate. Done. I'm showing to a guy who's moving here from Minneapolis. Maybe he'll be single. Or divorced. Or a mass murderer. JESS: Bye! VALERIE: I bought him new books. JESS: Great. I read this article that said all children are born geniuses. Their brains have three times as many connections as our brains, but they lose the ones that don't get mentally stimulated. I don't need him to be a genius. Too bad, because he is. How's Steve? He's fine. You set a date? Not yet. I'm used to running my own life. It's easy to steer a ship alone when there's no storm on the horizon, but you can't always count on that. You could use someone in your life. You can't keep a fish on the hook forever. Bye, Mom. Bye. [CHUCKLES] [PEOPLE CHATTERING AND PHONE RINGING] I want you to talk Steve out of trying this Bradican case. It's a waste of money. He hasn't got a prayer. You're the boss. You talk him out of it. When he defected from Walker's firm to come here, I promised him a free hand. It's in his contract. But you're not. You're on my time. I need you to pass the bar and start making your quota. Everybody's gotta step up around here. I'm getting married. Congratulations. You're meant to congratulate the groom. Who's the guy? What do you mean? You think I couldn't get a guy if I wanted one? I didn't know you wanted one. Neither did I. Oh... Alycia's getting married. Congratulations. [SOFTLY] To the groom. To the-- The groom. Poor guy. Like my grandmother used to say, for every pot, there's a lid. Insurance company's stonewalling in the Bradican case. Looks like we're going to court. So, what have you got for me? California, six years ago, insurance refused to pay for a bone marrow transplant for a cancer patient. They deemed it experimental. Really? Different diseases, same issues. The woman died. The family was awarded $89 million. Oh! You know what? You deserve a reward, and I am cooking Mexican tonight. I've got the bar exam in three months. I can't afford to flunk. My place whenever you get there. Okay? And I'll quiz you on torts. [SIGHS] My pictures are boring. Yeah. Do you like this color? What am I gonna do? Job fair's tomorrow. My interview's at 10. What's the big deal? The big deal's an internship looks good on my résumé. Too much work. I can't get a stupid scholarship without work. You wouldn't believe how many students I have to compete with. They're not you. Right. I'm unbelievably talented, although the world doesn't know it yet? If I don't figure it out, I'll be working at Pete's Pizzeria instead of going to college. You're going to college. Jake's asleep. I'll be at Steve's. He's cooking his way around the world. Tonight it's Mexican. Just don't bring us back any more of those doggie bags, okay? Don't tell him Caroline didn't eat his sauerkraut and bratwurst. [LAUGHS] Hey, you didn't either. I've got my cell. And you know Steve's number. It's tattooed on my brain. And if there's an emergency, call Megan. How many times do you have to tell me? Okay. My mom is like ten times worse. And now she's got a hate on for Shawn. [RINGING] It's Randy. Don't answer it. Make him sweat. Why? Because he's good at it. If you haven't hooked up by now, you're not going to. I can't help it. I mean, I want to, but I don't. Not with Randy. Well, in my opinion, if you even die a virgin, what are you so scared of? I'm not scared of anything. I told you, I just want it to be somebody who's hot. Yeah, well, good luck. [***] [JESS & STEVE MOANING] JESS: Oh, you're supposed to be coaching me for the bar. STEVE: Yeah, after the fajitas. This is after the fajitas. Really? Mm-hm. See what you do to me? I'm totally lost. I can't remember anything except making love to you. The fajitas were excellent. Thank you. You're gonna make somebody a wonderful wife. I figured once we got married, I'd teach you how to cook. No. No? Mm-mm. Don't count on it. Okay. [STEVE SIGHS] I'll be happy when we're not in separate places. Me too. But I need to finish this arc of motherhood with Sara. And living with me would disrupt that? Yes. But that doesn't apply to Jake? He's 3 years old. Right. And you'll be the only father he'll know. I like that. So do I. You'll be a great dad. And by the time we have to tell him the truth, it won't matter. It's never mattered. I told you. Yeah. Jake's father was a six-week fling. I never told him about Jake. Yes. I don't even remember him. Good. Good night. Good night. [***] [JESS MOANS SOFTLY] [GASPS] [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] [***] Sara? Hey, Mom. This one. And this one. And this one. They're all good. [SCOFFS] No, they're not. And I need this internship. Sara, I appreciate everything you're doing to help out with college. But whatever happens, you're going. So take the pressure off yourself, okay? Thanks, Mom. RANDY: Hey. Your cell was turned off last night. I had to study. Expect me to believe you'd rather study than talk with me? I wouldn't rather. I just-- I had to. Oh. You wanna go out tonight for your birthday? I can't. I have my family dinner. You wanna come? Uh-uh. I'm allergic to family dinners. I can go out another night. I might have to study. How about tomorrow? Yeah, okay. Tomorrow. See you. Okay. [***] Who's that? Yeah, definitely. GIRL: Definitely hot. CAROLINE: Trouble. GIRL: Definitely. My kind of trouble. [SCOFFS] You wish. [CAROLINE CHUCKLES] Go get him. I'll lend you my leather pants. Oh, I gotta go. There's Shawn. [STUDENTS CHATTERING] [SIGHS] Sara Gradwell? Yes. Gabe Emerson. GABE: Mm-hmm. You know these photos aren't exactly... earth-shattering, don't you? Do you know why? No. They're too perfect. Look, I know I can't send in a bunch of photographs to the college scholarship committee. And I know I have to make them stand out from everybody else's. Which is why I need this internship. I need to learn. So that's what this internship will do for you. What will it do for me? I will work really hard. Mules work really hard. I don't know what you want me to say. Say what's on your mind. If I'm a mule, you're a jackass. Okay. Art's about truth. And the truth is... I am a jackass. I'll get back to you. You did a great job. Morgans are happy campers. Congratulations. Uh, I'm late for a deposition. What time is the party tonight? It's after 7. Okay. Would you pick up wine? Yes. Okay. MAN: Thanks, Dr. Lofton. I'll see you Monday. [***] [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] Would you hold that? Thank you. ALEX: Jess? [ENGINE STARTS] Jess. What are you gonna do? Face him down. Look, I want this job. I need this job. I need to know what you know so I can get a scholarship. But I'm not gonna fall and beg, and I'm not gonna be intimidated. I made a bet with myself. I bet myself you had guts. So when do I start? If you're going to intern, we'll spend a lot of time together. How do you feel about that? Fine. I like to put things on the table. So do I. Okay, then. Let me be clear. [SIGHS] I'm used to schoolgirl crushes. Girls your age see me as an artist, an outlaw, and I want to disabuse you of that idea. I don't want any trouble, so we make a pact, okay? All work, no sex. Agreed? Agreed. Okay. My studio address is on the card. What'd he say? I got the job. [CHUCKLES] Megan, want a glass of wine? Uh, no. STEVE: Valerie? WOMAN: Steve is so great. Hey, Valerie, how's it going? VALERIE: I'm good. You said he was in Atlanta. What's he doing back here? I don't know. Maybe he's an expert witness for someone. What'd he say? Nothing. I didn't give him a chance. I panicked. Life is weird. You finally find this nice guy you wanna marry, and then Alex Lofton shows up. Alex was a donor. That's it. Sperm bank. Were you in love with him? That's irrelevant. The past three years, you've been pretending Jake's father doesn't exist, but he does exist. Today he was in your face. My bet is he's not gonna just disappear. Thank you, Steve. Here you go. SARA: Oh, exactly right. Thanks, Mom. Open mine next. It's for the inner you. Ah, you know me so well. Because in my heart, I'm still 18. [CHUCKLES] [***] Ooh, it's pretty. See, it's got that camera. Cool. Thanks. Oh, my God. [CHUCKLES] Thank you. [GIGGLES] [CAROLINE & SARA CHUCKLING] What's the joke? Nothing. How did the interview go for the internship? Okay. Who'd you interview with? A photographer, Gabe Emerson. Yeah, he's got a Harley, and he's hot. Oh. What's going on? Nothing. How old is Gabe Emerson? Who cares? CAROLINE: Twenty-seven. Twenty-eight. Why does it really matter, anyway? What's going on? Nothing. What does nothing mean? I mean, nothing's going on. And if there was, it's nobody's business. Well, it is our business. You're our child. I'm not a child. STEVE: Hold it, everyone. Now, Sara's right. She's 18. She can vote. She can join the Army. Thank you. You're the only one who seems to get it. STEVE: Welcome to emancipation, Sara. I... I know I'm not very good at this... letting-go stuff, Sara. It's hard to do. I don't know how you got to be 18 so fast. So if I have glue on my fingers... pry them loose, okay? And happy birthday. CAROLINE: Yeah. Thanks. Happy birthday. MEGAN: Happy birthday, Sara. SARA: Thanks. Are you angry at me? I don't like being undercut with Sara. It was just an opinion. Based on what? Well-- Like you said, you have no idea what it's like to raise a kid. Well, she's not a kid. She's 18. Eighteen is still a kid. All it takes is one mistake to mess up her entire life. Okay. I'm sorry. I apologize. I... Accepted. It's possible I overreacted. Yeah, well, it's also possible I'm just an amateur at trying to be a dad, so... Hey... Happy birthday, Sara. Good night. SARA: Good night. MEGAN: Bye. [DOOR CLOSES] [***] [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Jess, uh, it's Alex. Look, I know this is awkward, but... Listen, Alex, I've got something to say, and don't interrupt me. Just let me say it, okay? Okay. Goodbye. [***] When you finish your cereal, see if you can pull Jake away from his firetruck and get him into his coat. Sure. What time should I tell your grandmother you'll pick Jake up? I can't pick him up today. You always pick Jake up on Wednesday. I have class on Wednesdays, and I need this time to prep for the bar. Why does everybody's life have to revolve around Jake? When you were 3, everybody's life revolved around you. Too bad I don't remember. That's why I'm reminding you. Look, I got that intern job. I start today after school. I don't know how late I'm gonna be. The one with the photographer? The hot guy with the Harley? He's one of the best photographers in Baltimore. He had a one-man exhibition last year. You haven't even started, and already he's more important than your family obligations? Jake can stay with Grandma until you're done. Hold it. What kind of job goes until the middle of the night? And aren't those clothes a little provocative for someone going to work? Talk about glue on your hands. I am just trying to save you from making a mistake. If I don't make a mistake soon, I'm gonna be the most boring girl in school. [SIGHS] So, what did he say? He just said I had the job, and he gave me this card. She's gonna be working in the studio. Is that true? I guess so. [SNICKERS] Just the two of you, right? I don't know. So when do you start? He didn't say. Figured I'd go by the studio after school and check it out. Yeah. Maybe you should play hard to get. I don't think that's gonna work. I know. It never does. Check this out. A 90-dollar bottle of champagne from the Morgans. And flowers for you. An appreciative client. How rare is that? Very. And very nice. Privacy, please. See you later. He wants to honeymoon in Hawaii or the Caribbean, but I don't exactly see myself in a bikini. Well, pardon me for stating the obvious, but the honeymoon does involve a certain amount of being naked. So, what's the big deal about a bikini? The lights are off when I'm naked. Elope to Aspen. Ski clothes. Exactly. You're a genius. Oh. Who's Alex? It must be a mistake. Hmm. [***] [***] [KNOCKS ON DOOR] SARA: Hello? Gabe? If that's your car outside, you're in a tow-away zone. You the new intern? Yeah. I thought I was supposed to start today. Eh, Gabe's loose about time. So here to learn about photography? Yeah. Well, it's probably not a good idea to wait for him. He's doing some catalog work. Gotta earn a living. I'm Blair. Sara. Just leave your number. He'll get around to you. [SOFTLY] Okay. [***] [VALERIE CHUCKLES] Hi. VALERIE: Hi. I thought your mom said you were working. I thought I was, but I'm not. Probably start tomorrow. Oh, well, I'll get Jake's stuff. Oh, I'll just have time to make my aerobics class. [PHONE DIALS] Hey, Randy, it's me. Uh, sorry to cancel last minute, but I can't go out tonight. My mom's got school, and I have to babysit Jake. But maybe we can do something when you get back from Arlington. See you at school. Bye. [DOOR CLOSES] Thanks for picking up Jake. I got out earlier than I thought. How was work? Okay. I gave Jake dinner and a bath. He's asleep. Thank you. No problem. Where are you going? Caroline's. I have to study. You're going to study. Okay. I'm going to talk. We have a lot to talk about. It's a school night. I know it's a school night. I also know I'm an A student, I'm working my butt off to get a scholarship, and I'm 18. I don't want to fight every day so you can learn how to let go. I'm not very good at this. Well, practice. [***] [HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYS INDISTINCTLY ON CAR STEREO] CAROLINE: So you blew off a date with Randy so we could sit out here? I want to see if she's still there. It's not even 10:00. She's not going anywhere. You don't show up at a guy's place with food and wine and leave without sex. Maybe she lives with him. No. She doesn't. How do you know? She's coming down the stairs right now. She's not that pretty. She is. Do you think she saw us? No way. Are you sure? You're just imagining things. [SIGHS] [CELL PHONE RINGING] It's not Randy or Mom. [PHONE BEEPS] Hello? GABE: I'm doing a fashion spread for Baltimore Weekly. Be here at 4:00 tomorrow. It was him. Oh, God. How did he know we were here? I don't know. I'm so humiliated. [SIGHS] [DOORBELL RINGS] [DOORBELL RINGS] Hold on. [***] I don't want to see you. I meant to honor that, I swear. When I found out I was coming here on a case, I told myself I wouldn't call you, that I would honor your wishes. But then I saw you in the courthouse and all those resolutions went out the window. I have nothing to say to you. I know I hurt you. No, that was three years ago. I'm well over that. Yeah, I thought I was too, but I'm not. How's your wife? We're getting a divorce. Mmm. We've been there. She signs the papers as soon as I go home. Close but no cigar. She's got another guy. So do I. Jess, one cup of coffee. JAKE: Mom! [JAKE CRYING] Excuse me. [***] [SHUSHES] [***] [DOOR CLOSES] [KNOCKS ON DOOR] ALEX: Jess, we need to talk. [KNOB RATTLES] [SIGHS] Damn it. Jess, I'll stand out here all night if I have to. What's his name? Jake. Jake. It was my father's name. How old is he? What difference does it make? He's mine, isn't he? He's mine. I have a right to know. To know what? That I have a son. What right? You made a choice. I didn't find out I was pregnant until after you went back to your wife. For my children. What would like me to do? Call your wife in the middle of the night to tell her that I'm having her husband's child? I'm sure that's a call everybody would have appreciated. How could you not tell me? When did you want me to tell you, when he was born? I wrote you a letter when he was born and I burned it. He's beautiful. [***] God, I've missed you. [SIGHS] [PHONE RINGING] [ON MACHINE] Hi, it's Jess, leave a message. STEVE: Hi. Uh, I guess you're asleep. I'm just reminding you how much I love you. Good night, beautiful. [LINE CLICKS] I'm getting married. Congratulations. I want you to go now. Please. You have to leave. He may be named after your father, but he sure looks like my father. I've built a life. I won't let you come back and tear it all apart. You don't expect me to forget he exists. I told you. I want you to leave. Now. My cell phone's on here. Call it when you're ready to talk. I'm leaving, but I'm not going away. [***] [DOOR CLOSES] Who are you? I'm Alex. Alex who? You must be Sara. I'm a friend of your mother's. Actually, I'm... I'm Jake's father. You're the heart surgeon? He's real? In the flesh. Alex was just leaving. What's he doing here? Like your mother said, I'm just leaving. What's going on around here? Nothing. Okay, if she won't tell me, then you tell me. Up until tonight, I didn't know I had a son. And now that I've found out, I wanna make sure I don't lose him before I get to know him. What's going on? I told you. Nothing. It's not nothing. Don't tell me it's nothing. Are you okay? I'm fine. You don't look fine. I'm okay. And that's fine enough. You don't look okay, either. Did you have sex with him? That question is out of bounds, but no. Well, is he still married? Yes. No. I don't know. Sara, go to bed. Come on, don't do that. Talk to me like I'm a grown-up. I almost did something stupid tonight, okay? The same stupid thing I did three years ago. Is that grown-up enough for you? [SIGHS] Three years ago, you told me you were in love with him. Yeah, well, I'm supposed to be wiser now. Are you still in love with him? No. Are you telling me the truth? Alex Lofton was important to me. He was an event in my life. He was the best thing that ever happened to me. And the worst thing that ever happened to me. I'm sorry, Mom. The heart doesn't always make the best choice. It makes mistakes. Sometimes mistakes are... what make our life. And they make us who we are. You understand? I'm trying to. Anyway, everything turned out okay. I just can't afford another mistake. [***] Four-year-old Monica Bradican is diagnosed with severe acquired aplastic anemia. No siblings, no possibility of a perfect match, but she has stem cells available from her frozen umbilical cord. Correct. Yeah. A perfect match because they're hers, but there's only a small amount. So they were gonna be supplemented by a marrow transplant from her father, who isn't a perfect match. Which gave the insurance company a loophole. Right. They claimed the combination made the technique experimental and refused to pay. Treatment not proven using a large-scale randomized trial criteria. Mm-hm. And if Terry Bradican's friends and family were less generous with their loans, Monica would have died. And that's enough to make a jury weep. [PHONE RINGS] Jess Gradwell. ALEX [OVER SPEAKER]: I haven't heard from you. We have nothing to talk about. We have Jake to talk about. I can't right now. [HANGS UP PHONE] Something I should know about? [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] Nice! Up... Oh! Like this. Hindu! Beautiful. Now you hate me. Ah! You love me! Up... [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] Beautiful. Up! Head back! Nice. Okay. Hold it. You're late. Look, about the other night, I'm really embarrassed. [STEREO SHUTS OFF] I enjoy being stalked. I was just passing by. Whatever you say. Uh, ladies, this is Sara. WOMEN: Hey, Sara. Sara wants to see some juice. So when we get started again, just think about the guy who will be taking those clothes off of you. Is that your lunch? Camera on your back. Camera. Okay. Don't worry about where the light's coming from. Don't worry about anything, okay? Just use your instincts and shoot. Okay. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYS] Okay. Give me something hot. Uh, no. Sexy. So good. Even more lovely. Okay. GABE: Beautiful. Keep moving. Keep shooting. I don't care if all you get is an ankle, it'll still capture the motion. Good. * Well, I've been up And I've been down * * But most of the time I'm just played out * * Someone said To hit the ground running * * Stop spinning around About bad things coming * * 'Cause everyone's A shooting star... * Beautiful. Head back. Oh, the guy who gets you is one hell of a lucky man. Nice! * Everyone's A shooting star... * [SARA CHUCKLING] GABE: Move. Shoot around. Shoot. That's good. * Yeah, you are I never told him about Jake. And I never saw him again. And now he knows that Jake exists? He called me. I said I didn't wanna talk, so he just showed up. At your house? Why? I don't know why. Okay. I'm talking about Jake. He saw Jake. He put it together. He knows that Jake is his. And I don't know what he's gonna do. And is that your only concern? Jake? What do you mean, "only"? Jake's the biggest concern I've got. Hey, don't pick a fight with me, okay? I don't want this guy in my life any more than you do. He's got the law on his side. Want me to handle him? No. No. This is my mess, and I'm the one that's gotta clean it up. GABE: Hmm. This one's not bad. I like this one. Yeah, it's nice. You got her just right. You know I didn't take that picture. You could have. Do you think I have talent? I do. Give me a couple of your photos. I wanna show you something. And turn on the CD player while you're out there. [PHONTAINE'S "MONOCHROME" PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS] All right. Okay. This is a mixture of industrial chemicals, and I soaked your photo to break it down. It'll lose some of its clarity, start to look more like painting. SARA: Whoa. Okay. Take it. You wanna capture the essence of the image, the thing that made you wanna take the picture in the first place, you know? Your first impulse. SARA: It's beautiful. * Fill my soul * Help yourself Don't let it get cold * * Don't let it get cold * Don't let it get cold Go. [JESS SIGHS] [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] Looks like we run a laundry factory. Where does all this stuff come from? Where were you? Nowhere. With the photographer? For your information, he has a girlfriend. Her name's Blair. Any more information forthcoming? No. Okay. What would you think if I married Steve before you went off to college? Are you going to? It's a possibility. It's not my first choice, but it's okay. It wouldn't change anything with you and me. I'm going off to college. You're the one who has to live with him and eat all those weird dinners. [JAKE CRYING] Here. [DOORBELL RINGS] Hi. Hi. Where's your mom? Upstairs. Jake's cranky tonight. Would you go up and tell her I need to talk to her? No. Please. I'm not gonna go away until she comes down. She doesn't wanna see you. Tell her I love her. [***] It's him, the heart surgeon. He's downstairs. He says he needs to see you. He said he loves you. Remind him I'm getting married. How do you get these guys to want you? [JAKE GROANS SOFTLY] Can we hold this conversation another time? Well, the heart surgeon says he's not leaving. What do you want me to do? Make him some coffee and tell him to wait. Okay. [CELL PHONE RINGS] Gabe? GABE: Come back. Uh, Mom says wait in the kitchen. You know how to make instant? That's what doctors drink. Okay. Um... Tell Mom I had to go. [DOOR CLOSES] [CAR ENGINE STARTS] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] It's impressive. I'm studying for the bar. Where'd Sara go? I-- She didn't say. She say when she'd be back? Sorry, no. This is very confusing for her, you know. She's upset. She seemed fine to me. Well, she's not. And neither am I. Maybe I made a mistake not telling you about Jake, but you can't just burst back into town after three years and disrupt everything in your path. You have to be crazy to think I was gonna say "Welcome back. Here's your son." Well, there's gotta be something between that and I don't exist. Like what? Well, start with I'm still in love with you. [SCOFFS] We don't even know each other. What do you wanna know? Nothing. I like the Lakers. I don't like the Red Sox. I don't go to church, but I believe there's a God somewhere that cares about what happens to this mixed-up human race. I'm allergic to chocolate. I work too hard. I have bouts of insomnia. Two weeks ago, I fell asleep at my daughter's dance recital. I married my wife when I was a surgical resident and she was a nurse. She got pregnant. I felt obligated. Too much information. I was never in love with her. And somewhere inside, she knew that. So I couldn't blame her for having affairs. I couldn't be righteous. Enough. Do you want some help with that? Sure. You do laundry? I have been domesticated. Exactly the problem. You'd think you'd appreciate someone who was pretrained. Look... I know you're not just gonna say, "Hey, Alex, I forgive you." [CHUCKLES] Oh, you got that right. Look, I know you've got legal rights. I didn't come here to talk about my legal rights. I came here to talk about us. There's no us. [***] I told you, I moved on. [JESS MOANS] I-- I can't-- I can't do this. You're not divorced yet. You're not married yet. I won't let you mess my life up again. I love you. Don't say that. I love you, Jess. Tell me you don't love me. I don't love you. Tell me you never wanna see me again. I never wanna see you. [***] What do you want? Everything. How could we have let this happen? It happened because we couldn't stop it. I'm getting married... to a wonderful man... who's good to me, and he loves me. I love you. But I don't love you. I won't love you. Okay. If you say so. I do. This isn't love. It's just... an attraction. It's just... physical. And it's just... What? Sexual. And it's very powerful. I admit it. And I don't regret it because... Because I have Jake. But it has nothing to do with my life today. Is that the choice you're making? Steve's reliable. I can count on him. And he's gonna make a wonderful husband. [SIGHS] And I love him. Are you sure? Yes. [SIGHS] Oh, why did you come back? I wrecked your life once. I don't wanna do that again. I'll do anything you want. I'll do anything you want... except give up Jake. [SIGHS] What do you want in your coffee? Everything, heh. You got plans this weekend? No. You wanna hang? You mean it? [EXHALES SHARPLY] I mean it. [SIGHS] I'm so happy. Good. You're the most wonderful thing that's ever happened to me. Mm-hm. You say that to all the guys? [CHUCKLES] There are no other guys. Come on. You're no virgin. No, I am. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] It's true. You're my first. [DIALING] [DOOR CLOSES] Just running a little late. Don't worry. I'll make it to school. Hold it! I've been worried sick. Your phone's off, Caroline didn't know where you were. Figured with the heart surgeon here, you wouldn't notice. Don't be smart. I asked you a question. No, you didn't. Where were you? Spent the night at Gabe's studio. The photographer? You said he had a girlfriend. Well, she wasn't there, obviously. He's committed to someone else. How do you know? He's not married like your heart surgeon. You're barely 18. A 28-year-old man is a mistake. It wasn't a mistake. It was great. You're the one who said your mistakes made your life. I have the same rights. You may have rights, but you don't have the same experience. How do you expect me to get that? Oh, Sara. I was hoping your first time would be with someone special. So I can be the oldest living virgin in America, just waiting for the right one? What if he's the right one? [SCOFFS] What if I'm in love with Gabe, he's in love with me? Is that special enough? Oh, my God. Where are your brains? Maybe my brains are at the same place yours are. Can't believe I'm hearing this from you. You had a baby with somebody you knew for six weeks. Think you're old enough to have the answers? I'm old enough to vote, make my own decisions, and old enough to know how not to get pregnant. That's enough. I have to get ready for school. Sara! Oh! [PHONE RINGS] Hello? ALEX: I'm only gonna be here another couple of days. We need to talk about Jake. I'm not ready. I made a reservation at Marco's, near the courthouse. I know where it is. Bring your fiancé. I wanna put everything on the table. [PHONE BEEPS OFF] [SIGHS] I'm in love. He loves me. Sara, I thought this was supposed to be about sex? Yeah, well, it took a turn. Be specific. Like nobody does the things that we did unless you're in love. You're not exactly the greatest judge. I mean, who do you have to compare him with? Maybe I'll move out of my house and move in with Gabe, you know, at least until I go to college. Did he ask you to? No, but I'm sure he will after this weekend. You're gonna spend the weekend with him? That's the plan. Well, that's great. It's more than great. I'll see you. Randy. The team bus is leaving in 30 minutes. Look, I'm sorry about the other night. Ah, forget it. Wish me luck in Arlington, all right? You know what, I'm tired of you being weird. If you've got something to say, spit it out. I met someone else. What someone else? Like, someone older. Someone not in high school, okay? Okay by me. There's plenty of girls waiting in Arlington. You got 'em to cave. You got the biggest insurance company in the state to settle. I'm only sorry I don't get a chance to beat them in court. They knew we had them. I get to call Alycia. Let me call the Bradicans. They have to okay the settlement. And then we go to Marco's and present a solid front? Okay. Thank you. I can't leave the raising of my son to a stranger. Yeah, well, you're the stranger to Jake, not me, so... Not my choice. I wasn't given a choice, and I'm-- Right. Can we just cool it with the accusations? I'm just bringing you up to speed on the history. She's told me everything, so-- Let's keep it in the present. Sure. Steve's sitting where I wanna sit, and I can't do anything. Look, um... we're here to talk about Jake, so, um, let's try and keep it civilized. Okay. So let's talk about our son. Jake and I need to get to know each other, so, what if I flew up once a month and took him for the weekend? And do what? I don't know, usual stuff. The zoo, playground, junk food. [CHUCKLES] He doesn't know you, so I would have to be with you the first couple of times. That's fine. And there's child support. We don't need child support. It's my obligation. If you don't need it, open up an account for him after we agree on an amount. Your discretion. Okay. Oh, I'd like to start an educational fund for him. Thank you. Yeah. And there's the issue of his name. It's Gradwell on the birth certificate. Yeah, I'd really like to change that. I had hoped to adopt him after we got married. That's out of the question. Why is that out of the question? It's non-negotiable. Nobody wants a custody fight. Please. This is Jake's reality. Steve, Alex is his father. Yeah, biological. Yeah, that's the definition. Please. Look, Alex, 3-year-olds become 13-year-olds really fast. You have kids, you know how that happens. And you're gonna be in Atlanta. I'm gonna be the primary parent, and I would like to have ultimate authority over decisions that could affect Jake's life. Absolutely. With discussion. How much discussion? Enough. We're gonna have to trust each other here. I'm not some guy you picked up in a bar. Jake was conceived in a relationship. Yeah, it may have been transient, but it was real love. Hey. Where's Sara? Oh, uh, I don't know. She called and asked me to babysit until you came home. I had nothing better to do. I never have anything better to do. Oh, your luck will change. What time did she say she'd be back? She said she'd be gone all weekend. Oh, Megan. She thinks she's in love. She's 18. You can't tell her she's not. How'd it go at dinner? [SCOFFS] It was hard, especially for Steve. I'm gonna have to share Jake starting tomorrow. Alex and I are spending the day with him. You don't wanna give Alex another chance? No way. He's married, he's divorced, he's married, he's divorced. Depending on the day. I slept with him. I thought maybe that happened. Oh, I'm so confused. I don't know how I feel anymore. You better find out. It looks to me like Alex is in your life from here on out. And you can't refuse to see him. Well, it'll be easier after Steve and I are married. Are you gonna marry Steve just to protect yourself from getting hurt again? Where are you going? I've got an assignment. What assignment? Hey, I do have to work, you know. It's Saturday. I'll see you later. When? Around 8:00. [MOTORCYCLE STARTS, REVVING] All right. Come on. Eat your breakfast. We have to go meet your daddy. Daddy? I know I haven't told you anything about your daddy, because he's been away for a while. But now he's back. It may take you a little time to get used to him, but he's a very nice man. And if you give him a chance, you're really gonna like him. Okay. Okay. The truth? I'm a little nervous myself. [***] Mm-hm. [CHILDREN CLAMORING EXCITEDLY] Okay. There he is. The man in the brown jacket. See, doesn't he look nice? What do you think? Okay. Let's bite the bullet. This is your daddy. ALEX: Hi. Hi. [***] Okay. Wait, wait, wait. JAKE: One of each. JESS: Oh, okay. Two at the same time. Yeah. They're really hungry, huh? JESS: Very hungry. [ALEX CHUCKLES] JAKE: Whoa! Go ahead, throw it. He'll get it. Good catch. He got it. Hey, hey. Where's she at? He's a great kid. I know. This is not gonna be so tough. Not for you. We're not gonna have a kid with too many people in our lives. I think we should be friends. Okay. We're friends. Would you stop being so polite to me? I'm always polite. I... That's not what I remember. [CHUCKLES] [CHUCKLES] [LAUGHS] JESS: You do crazy things when you're young. We're still young. And I think what happened the other night qualifies as crazy. I had a temporary lapse in judgment. Thank God. It was pretty crazy. Unlikely moments seem to be our thing. Never thought that in one of those moments we'd be creating this great kid. I always thought when Jake was born, he had a plan for me. Well, I guess he had a plan for both of us. I'll see you in a month, big guy. Okay? Okay. Bye-bye. [SIGHS] Monday is my last day in court. I'll,um, be in touch. Okay. Take care of yourself. Hey. It was a really nice day. Yeah. [***] [PHONE RINGS] [PHONE BEEPS ON] [SIGHS] Hello? ALEX: Hi. Listen, I'm on a 4 p.m. flight back to Atlanta Monday, and, uh, well, I've had some second thoughts about Jake. So have I. Well, we need to talk, just the two of us. Can I come by tomorrow? No. Uh, I'll meet you on neutral ground. Okay. How about the coffee shop near your house? Ten o'clock. Okay. [PHONE BEEPS OFF] [SARA BLOWS] [***] [DOORBELL RINGS] Coq au vin? Thanks. I'm not hungry. Yeah. It'll freeze. I tried to call you. I wasn't picking up. I figured. Well, I've had some thinking to do. Can I get you some coffee? Uh, I'd rather have a Scotch. Thanks. Look... I know dinner was hard for you, and I'm sorry. It was hard for me too. [ICE CLINKS] But disappearing is not a mature response. Yeah, maybe not. I'm a trial lawyer, remember? Spent the last 24 hours going back and forth between being a prosecutor and a defense attorney. Who's on trial? Me? [SIGHS] No, our future. What does that mean? Look, um... I never had a family. And I didn't miss it. At least I told myself I didn't miss it. And then... I ran into you. Suddenly not only do I want it all, it looks like I'm gonna have it all until this guy shows up. I don't have a postcard family, Steve. I-- I'm divorced. I have a child out of wedlock. You knew that. Mm-hm. And I'm sorry if you've romanticized it and it's not holding up for you. That is not the point. Well, what is? Come on, you don't know? Obviously it's about Alex. You're damn right it's about Alex. How do you think it felt watching the two of you, huh? Like all you wanted to do was have a go at it on the table. That's not true. You could cut the sex with a knife, Jess. I'm sorry. About what? I'm sorry you're hurt. I'm sorry you're angry. And are you sorry you slept with him? What, are you taking the Fifth here? You slept with him. Didn't you? Did you? [***] Were you... Were you gonna tell me? I've been trying to find the right words. Well, find them. It didn't mean anything. Oh. So it's just sex. And what makes you think that's okay? Where is your integrity? Where does that leave me? At the altar, waiting for a woman I can't trust? I said I'm sorry. Oh, come off it. Because you-- You are not the kind of person who has one last fling for auld lang syne. And you expect me to marry a woman who is in love with someone else. I'm not in love with him. Steve-- Look... he is going to be coming in and out of our lives. And every time he shows up, I am gonna be wondering what is going on between the two of you. And I can't do it. [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] [***] [PHONE DIALS] [LINE RINGING] [ON RECORDING] If you want Caroline, leave a message. Caroline, it's me. I'm at Gabe's. My car got towed. Can you come get me? VALERIE: Okay. Thanks for giving up your Sunday. I didn't have anything better to do. Maybe I might take him to the children's museum. Did you know a child's brain can hold ten times more information than the National Archives? No. And I'm not sure that's true. Well, I read it, and it is true. You don't look right. Steve and I had a misunderstanding. Bye, Mom. Bye, Jake. Well, I guess so, with all of this going on. Should never have taken Steve to that dinner. A woman can't deal with two men at the same time. Are you okay? I don't know. Can you straighten this out? Not with Alex in our life. Mmm. You okay? My car got towed. You need a ride home? My friend's coming to get me. Where's Gabe? I don't know. Do you? No. Never showed up last night. Yeah, he does that. Why aren't you mad at me? [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] It's not your fault. You're a kid. Anyway, I'm used to the way he is. Is he always with somebody else? It's always a possibility. Why do you put up with it? Because we're alike. [VEHICLE APPROACHING] [HORN HONKS] [SARA SNIFFLES, SIGHS] What happened? He never showed up. You spent the night there by yourself? Yeah. And I don't wanna talk about it. I just wanna go get my car. It's Sunday. You can't get your car until tomorrow. God, I can't go home and admit to my mom that she was right. Can I stay at your house tonight? Sure. You wanna go get something to eat? Yeah. I'm starving. So, um, I've been thinking. Me too. Steve's a decent enough guy. I want your life to work out for you. [SIGHS] The thing is, you and I have a wonderful child. And I got territorial. I mean, it's possible that I was so busy staking out my claim on him... that I missed the bigger picture. You know? No. I'm trying to rise above what I want and think what's best for him. You do understand that? Go on. I just start thinking about this from his perspective. I mean, am I doing what's best for him, or am I imposing myself on him and on you for selfish reasons? Are you? I don't know. Jake's pretty young for the truth, but it's his truth. That's the dilemma. Yes. Still, he's... maybe too young to comprehend the situation, at least for now. So... you're going back to your wife? Is that what this is about? She's not my wife. In less than a week, she will officially be my ex-wife, and I'm going to tell her everything. It's about your kids then. Uh-huh, partially. I mean, it'll be hard to hit them with this on top of the divorce, you know? I'm gonna have to figure something to tell 'em. I don't know what it is you want. You saying you're gonna give up your legal rights? Fine, because it'd make my life a hell of a lot easier. No, I didn't say that. I just meant my kids are gonna need some time. That's all. Jake might need time. Maybe you need time. I'm trying to be a good father. Help me. You're the primary parent. This is a discussion. Okay. You're right. You should come back when Jake is a little older. I think that's a great idea. [SIGHS] How old is old enough? I don't know, Alex. Five, 6, 7, never. I don't know what you want. You know what I want? I want that amazing day in the park. That's what I want. The three of us. You and me and Jake, the way it might have been if I had known we had a child. Well, that was then, and this is now. [SIGHS] Okay. Then we'll proceed on good faith. Just don't jump into anything. Make sure that how and when I become a part of Jake's life is in his best interests. Fine. Thank you. For what? For Jake. [***] One minute I'm a happy person with a fantastic daughter, great boyfriend, promising future... and the next thing I know, everything's falling apart. How did I get here? A-L-E-X. I am not in love with Alex. Then why are you sitting here? Why aren't you trying to make things all right with Steve? I don't know. Maybe because if you were really in love with Steve, you wouldn't have slept with Alex. I don't need to hear this right now, Megan. [SIGHS] Looks like Sara's not coming home again. She's 18. Stop saying that. And don't tell me not to worry. You can't stop biology. Sara's gonna have good experiences and bad ones. Just hope she finds her own truth. That's what separates the women from the boys. Are you talking about Sara or me? Look, if you are still in love with Alex, and I'm not saying you are, just a hypothetical... then why are you letting him get away? I don't wanna get hurt again. [SCOFFS] Fine. Take that to bed with you tonight. [***] There you are. There we are. [SIGHS] You look terrible. I didn't sleep much. I can believe that. [SUCKS TEETH] Why don't you just call in sick? Take a day off. Go to a movie. Go to a spa. Give yourself a break. When do you get a break? Oh, I'm fine. Well, if I can pass the bar, my income will go up a third and I can start looking for preschools. Don't rush anything. Thanks, Ma. Mm-hm. JAKE: Bye, Mom. Bye, Jake. [CHUCKLES] Bye, Mom. [***] [SIGHS] [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] You want half of my sandwich? What kind? Peanut butter. I didn't have any breakfast. Me neither. I cut work. I cut school. You ever do that before? No. Me neither. Once. Caroline and I went to a spa and she charged it to her dad. [CHUCKLES] Thank goodness, you're not perfect. Why'd you cut work? Steve and I got in a fight. You broke up? Yes. Because of the heart surgeon? [SIGHS] I... Maybe I'm supposed to be alone. A lot of women are, and they're fine. What about the heart surgeon? He hurt me. I can't trust him again. You were right about Gabe. I didn't wanna be right. I really wanted things to work out with him. Just because we want something badly... doesn't make it different from what-- From what it really is. Just so you know, I used birth control. Good girl. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Hey, at least I'm not a virgin anymore. Virginity's not everything it's cracked up to be. Yeah, well, sure was easier being a virgin. That's because women... always mix up sex and love. Why? I don't know. It's just the way we are. How can you tell the difference? To tell you the truth, I still don't know. You trust your heart, I guess. What if your heart makes a mistake? It's better for your heart to make a mistake than to live your life without heart. Do you think I'll ever fall in love again? You will. Guaranteed. Yeah. It might take a while. It might. [***] What are you doing? JESS: Paying bills. My camera was expensive, right? Worth every penny. That bill doesn't come until next month. I guess I should get a real job after school instead of an internship. Once I pass the bar, we won't have to worry about money so much. I think you should marry the heart surgeon. For money? I believed him when he said he loved you. I think you might be in love with him too. Oh, and what makes you think that? Come on, I have experience now. [SIGHS] He's leaving on a 4:00 p.m. flight. Maybe he's still at his hotel. Not likely. Do you have his cell number? [DIALING] [LINE RINGS] RECORDED VOICE: The party you are trying to reach is either unavailable or out of the area. Just as well. No answer. I bet if you were to leave now, you'd catch him before his plane takes off. Go. What if it works out? [CHUCKLES] That'd be a good thing, Mom. You're my only daughter, and you're on the threshold of your life and you need me. Hey, I'm going off to college. With or without a scholarship, that's what you said, right? So... whatever happens, I'm gonna be somewhere and you're gonna be somewhere else. Things are never gonna be different between us, Sara. No matter if I'm with someone or without someone or where I am or wherever you go in the world... I am still your mother. Heh, I knew that. Go. Okay. [INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER PA] WOMAN [OVER PA]: Paging Dr. Lofton. Dr. Alex Lofton, please come to a white courtesy phone. Come on. Yes, this is Dr. Lofton. Alex. It's me, Jess. Hello. What are you doing here? [***] [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] Sorry. Are you sure? The question is, are you sure? Yes. No, I mean, we have a history. You come close and then you back off. And it's always for an honorable reason. I will never break your heart again. I need to be sure. You can't be sure. I can't be sure that you won't break my heart. We've both been through enough to know that life doesn't come with guarantees. All I know is I love you. I love you more than I've ever loved anyone. What if I come up every weekend until Sara goes to college? Think we can get everyone together for a camping trip, get the kids to know each other? Get my kids used to the idea before you and Jake come down to Atlanta? I know you are gonna ace the Georgia bar. I'm sorry, I'm all over the place, but... I think you missed your plane. Good. Oh! [ALEX CHUCKLES] [GASPS, SIGHS] [***]
