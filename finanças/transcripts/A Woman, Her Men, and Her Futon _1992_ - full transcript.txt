[MUSIC PLAYING] What do you do when things start looking the same? Sounding the same? Feeling the same? What do you do when you become tired of pleasing somebody? How do you get that freedom to say what's really on your mind? [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Hi. I can come directly from work. OK. OK. Bye bye. Your husband? No, Donald. What does he want? I'm having dinner with him tonight. I was kind of hoping we could spend some time together tonight. You know, I'm leaving Friday. I know. I'm sorry. He's making this film soon. This could be my chance to learn. Has he even raised the money? Yeah. How'd he get it? His family. What does he want you to do anyway? I told you, his assistant. What's the underwear for? He said I can take a shower at his place. Why do you need to take a shower? What do you think? I need to change. I would like to take a shower at the end of the day. So why don't you come back here to shower? Paul, I'm not driving 40 minutes fighting traffic. What do you got for me today? Two. Videos? One more. Videos, videos, three videos. Thank you very much. - You're welcome. - Bye, sweetie. Bye. Beyond me. Why? I just don't see what men see in men. Hm. Especially when there are women like you around. It's too early for that, Randy. No. I mean it. I'm touched. Is it true that you're leaving us? I don't know yet. I find out this evening. So you're going to file for divorce? I don't know. It's only been two months since I left him. A couple of his friends are coming to LA next week. He wants me to go and stay with them while they're here. Are you going to go? Things are beyond repair really. So why didn't you call me after that? It's been what? Two months I haven't seen you. Well, I wanted to settle, find a job. Oh, yeah, tell me about that. It's a film production company? They mainly do music videos. So what exactly do you do for them? I handle the phone. Well, don't worry about it. Once we start doing this film, you're going to be doing much better. And if you need anything now, all you have to do is ask. I want you to know that. - Thanks. I'm OK. When do you think we'll start? Soon. Very soon. I'm still having a few problems with the script, so I want to finish it first. Hm. Well, why don't you show it to me? I mean, I won't judge you or think any less of you if it's you know-- Well, maybe I should do that finally. Tell you what, I'll show you the outline when we come back from dinner. OK. I got to tell you something. What? I lost one of my main backers for the film. What happened? Well, you know how these things go. I thought it was family money. Well, it is. I mean, not really. Not all of it. So you're not going to be able to make it? Oh, yeah, I'm going to be able to make it. It just might take a couple of weeks longer to get it in place, that's all. See, that's why we're having dinner with Max. I want to ask him if you'd be willing to get involved. Can he raise money? Can he raise money? Yeah. He's one of the biggest people in the business. So what do you want to do in this business, Helen? I just want to write. Have you written anything? I've been working on something for the past couple of months since I finished school, but I have put it aside for now. Just to gain some perspective. In the meantime, I want to get involved in production. I'll be helping Don with his film. Oh, what's it about? Deception. What about deception? Well, you know the lies men and women tell each other. Is there a story? A story. Well, in a nutshell, it's about this guy who believes that the only way he can win the woman of his dreams is by pretending to be wealthy and powerful. So when he finally meets this beautiful woman in the boutique where she works, he poses as a big time stockbroker, and she falls for him. And something begins to develop between them, but you see, this way he's trapped himself. He doesn't know if she's after him for himself or for his money. Why would he think she's after his money? Well, because he knows that she has a dream. She wants to establish her own boutique. Doesn't she realize he's a fake? Not really. You see, he's very clever. He keeps buying her gifts and taking her places, you know, to protect his image. She tells him all kinds of lies too. Like her family's very wealthy, you know, so he doesn't get the impression that she's after his money, and she fakes her orgasms. She fakes her orgasms? Poor darling. Does he know she's faking? We know, but he suspects. How does this story resolve itself, Don. I haven't worked out the ending yet. I don't know if I want to keep them together or have them part. I don't know. Uh-huh. Well, it sounds interesting. I think so. It's amazing how much deception there is between men and women, especially here in LA today. I mean, there's a lot of sex being sold. Sometimes just the promise of sex. You really believe that? Yeah. All this obsession with success and careers. I mean, it's not who a person is anymore. It's what you can do for me. You have something I want, fine. If not, I'll get it elsewhere. I don't think that you can-- And people are going for the highest bid. I don't think-- Love is becoming an old fashioned word. I don't think you can reduce it to that. Oh, come on, Gail. Look around you. If you're not driving a Mercedes or a Jaguar in this town people think you're a loser. Darling, men are much more obsessed with success than women, and they're willing to go to any length to make it. They're willing to lie, cheat, you name it. They'd sell their mothers for it. That's because they know it's the only thing women go for. Oh, please. All right, guys, listen, listen. This is just a movie, right? What do you think about all this, Helen? I think it can be true sometimes. I think it's more complex than that, not that you're being simplistic. Oh. Anyway, we can shoot the whole thing for under a million. No special effects, no car crashes, nothing. Most of the scenes take place indoors, bedrooms, living rooms, you know, restaurants. A lot of scenes in restaurants. It's amazing between men and women how much action takes place in restaurants. Uh-huh. Well, I'd like to read it. Excuse me. She's very nice. Very. So tell me, Don, you and she uh? Huh? Huh? Well, we're good friends really. I mean, we do have a relationship, but she sees other men, and I'm free to see other women. He wants to show me the outline. PAUL: I'll bet he does. Paul. PAUL: He might also want you to take another shower at his place. Why can't you just-- just say that you have to leave? Just take a stand for once. I have to go. PAUL: All right then. I'll be at your place at 1:00. So you called someone? Uh-huh. Your husband? I had to call. Your husband? Uh-huh. You had to call him at midnight? Yeah. I thought you called him today. He worries. That's my problem. I can't seem to take a stand. Do you want her to lie so much? Why not? But do we like her? Do we have to? It would help. Instead of having her tell outright lies, why don't you have her conceal things? That might be better. Yeah. Actually, when you finish the first draft, I might have a better idea of what you're trying to say. I think so. I had a great time. I'm glad. You know, you can stay here if you like? It's tempting. I should go home. OK. Well, I'll walk you down. Stay with me tonight. I can't tonight. You know, when you were with your husband, I didn't want to confuse you. I was always concerned about our friendship. You'll always have that. Let me take you somewhere, a little vacation. Where? Hawaii. Mexico. Just someplace to get some fresh air, something like five days maybe? I mean, you need it after this ordeal. Let's do that. Can you get off work for five days? I don't know. I have to see. Can you take two days off? Maybe like Thursday and Friday, then we can come back Sunday night. It's a possibility. OK. Well, I'll call my travel agent and let you know then. OK. Goodnight. Goodnight. - Hey. - Ah! Jesus. I knew you were going to park here. So how was dinner? Dinner was fine. I don't know why you want to waste your time working on his-- on other people's projects. I mean, I think if you should work on your own script. Don't bug me about my script, OK? All right, but at least show it to other people, for God's sake. I mean, if you don't trust my opinion, then show it to someone who knows. I think it's great. - Yeah, right. That's the most self pitying trash ever written? You're never going to let me forget that, are you? No, I guess not. You are in a lousy mood tonight, aren't you? I don't want you waiting for me. I didn't leave my husband to get in this kind of relationship. You know, the place is really jammed. I know the owner. He'll take care of us. All right. When? Really? Uh-huh. Tonight. Where is it again? Santa Monica and 5th. What's it called? 5th Avenue. By the way, I talked to the travel agent, and we can go to Hawaii on Wednesday for five days. I really shouldn't do that. Why not? All my problems with Ted, I just-- I just don't feel like it. Well, that's why you should go. It'll make you feel better. I don't want to get involved now. We won't get involved. We'll sleep in separate beds. I'll wear a chastity belt. I'll give you the key. What do you think? I can't afford to leave work now, honestly. Don't worry about work. What do you mean, don't worry? Of course, I worry. - I'll help you out. You need money? I'm doing OK. No, really, tell me. I want to help you solve your problems. The problem solver. Specifically financial problems. I'm doing OK. You don't have any financial problems? No, I mean, I have my credit card debt, but it's not really a problem. How much is it? Like $3,000. $3,000. I didn't spend it on nothing though. It's really what I survived on after I left Ted. I can lend you $1,000. I don't want to have to do that. Think of it as a long term loan, no interest. You can pay me back when you can. When you sell your script. Wouldn't that ease you off a little? I got my checkbook in the car. Come on, what are you so scared of? Nothing. Well, let's do it. I guess I better tell you. What? You may have noticed I'm seeing someone. No, I had no idea. Yeah. How long's it been? Almost a year. You left your husband for him? No. I would have left Ted anyway. So how's it going? Not very well. We broke up a couple of times. Now it's kind of-- but he's the only one who knows my life and what I've been through. That's why I can't go with you now. I don't want to hop from one relationship to another. You've lost your judgment. No I haven't. This is a check for $1,000. I want you to take it and forget about it, OK? OK. I just want to be your friend. Thank you. Helen, your juggling men. Yeah. I shouldn't have told me. I'm just kidding. Do you want to? [BEEP] PAUL: Hey, it's Paul. Call me as soon as you get this. I want to see you before I leave. [BEEP] MRS. SACKER: Miss Morris? This is Mrs. Sacker from Citibank, please call me at 800-645-9565. Thank you. [BEEP] TED: Hi, this is Ted. Would you give me a ring? [BEEPING] Hi, this is Don. I'm sorry I missed your call. Please leave a message, and I'll call you back as soon as I can. [BEEP] Hi, Don, this is Helen. I'm just calling to say hello, and I want to thank you for being my friend today. It really means a lot to me. Talk to you soon. Bye bye. [KNOCKING] Helen? [KNOCKING] Helen? [KNOCKING] Helen, you in there? [BANGING] Helen? [PHONE RINGING] DON: Helen, this is Don. I got your message. I'm sorry I missed you. Hello? DON: You're home? Yeah. DON: How are you? I'm all right. DON: You sound scared. I'm all right. DON: Something wrong? Nothing. You know that man I told you about? DON: Yeah. I'm not going to see him anymore. DON: Well, I'm sure it's all for the best. Yeah. DON: Let me take you to dinner tonight? Oh, tonight, I can't. DON: How about tomorrow night? Tomorrow night, OK. [MUSIC PLAYING] You want something to drink? Water. Water? That's all you want is water? OK. OK, a gin and tonic and a water. If I can't get you drunk, you're taking away my most effective weapon. You don't have to get me drunk to take advantage of me. [PHONE RINGING] Bye. Bye. [BEEP] PAUL: Hey, it's Paul. It's Friday night. Shit. Where are you? [BEEP] TED: Hi, this is Ted, your husband. Do you remember me? Bob and Mary are here. [BEEP] TED: It's 3:30 in the morning. I don't know where the fuck you are. [BEEPING] I was here. TED: No, you weren't. I called you twice. Don't lie to me, Helen. Ted, I was here. I just wasn't answering the phone. TED: Well, why not? I wasn't in the mood. TED: You're fucking around, aren't you? I'm going to hang up now. TED: Well, you know what? You know what you are? I'll tell you. You're a fucking whore. You're a fucking no mad whore. The cheapest hobo slut I've ever known. All I asked you to do was to come and stay here today for Bob and Mary, and you know what? I hate your fucking guts. Your whole attitude is-- What did he say? I don't want to repeat what he said. He just wants to hurt me. What? He didn't believe you were at home? No. Don't worry about it. He knows he's losing you. He's just desperate. Can I ask you something? Hm? Do you care about him? In many ways, of course. I mean, we really grew up together. Eight, years I lived with him, since I was 17. - So why did you leave him? - We grew apart. I changed. I want more than just a family and kids. He didn't want you to go to film school? No. What'd he say? He didn't say anything. I just remember the look on his face. You know, the only thing that's going to help you get over this is simply a meaningful relationship. Really. I don't think I could handle another relationship now. You know, I have this friend who's an actress. She's one of my favorite women, and she can have three, four relationships at the same time. And when she's working, she sleeps with her leading man every time. It's incredible. Some women can do that, I guess. I don't know how she found the physical time. Well, she has a lot of money. She doesn't have to worry about finding time. She doesn't have to worry about making a living. Exactly. Why? Are you worried? I don't want you to worry. You're working. You're doing OK. I'm doing OK. You know, if you fell in love with me, all your problems would be solved. I bet. OK, here you go. Thank you. Can we take this home? Certainly. I want to tell you something. What? This sounds crazy, but I don't want you to think that I help you out or that I always pay when we eat because I want to have sex with you. I know. I have too much respect for you to do that. I know. I mean, obviously I'm very interested in you, but I'd help you out anyway. I just want to make sure that you understand that. I understand. I mean, because if sex was all I wanted from you, we could have had that a long time ago. And you know it. Thank you again for dinner. You always feed me. At least invite me up for coffee. OK. Do you like this computer? Oh, it's all right. Paul gave it to me actually. Do you see him these days? Every now and then. You're too dangerous. I can't trust myself if I go with you on a trip. You're just saying that. No, I really mean it. [TEAKETTLE WHISTLING] You breathe like a cat. Let's go sit there. So how's the script going? Fine. I think you're going to like it. Have you been talking to Monica? No. No. Just this. Take it off. No. I just want to hold you naked. You said you wanted to be my friend. I do. I just want to hold you naked like a friend. You're so sexy. No. Just the bra. I just want to feel your skin. You have beautiful breasts. No. You're so scared. I'm not scared. What is it then? No, I really can't. It just doesn't feel right. What do you see? Two strangers. I'm trying to know you. I know. I'm just going through a rough time right now. Let me get my life together first. You think I'm playing games? I don't know. What do you mean? I think you're very attractive. I really mean it. I just-- I'm not ready right now. Why not? You know why. All my problems with Ted. Can't you understand that? Will you sleep with me when you're feeling better? You know what you just told me about that actress? Yeah. I think I'm gonna start doing that. Will I be on the list? You're always on the list. RANDY: Hello? Randy. [PHONE RINGING] TED: Hi, Helen, it's Ted. I'm so sorry about the other day. I don't know what came over me. Well, anyway, why don't you come back? [BEEP] TED: Hi, Helen, it's Ted. I'm so sorry about the other day. I don't know what came over me. Well, anyway, why don't you come back? I'll change. I promise I'll change. We'll see a therapist. We'll go north for Christmas. We'll see my-- Donald. What are you doing in my part of town? What? You hang up on him? No bye? Nothing? I was just listening to my answering machine. Oh. This is Donald. Randy, how you doing? Pleased to meet you. George. So what are you doing here? Having breakfast with my friend George. He lives in the neighborhood. I see. What about you? What are you up to? We're also having breakfast, and going to the teller machine. So how's the writing going? Oh, good. I just finished the script, took it to Max. He's suppose to call me and let me know in a couple of days. Great. Great. Donald is the friend that I told you about that I went to film school with. We're going to be working together soon. Don't bet on it. She's starting to have second thoughts about that. So what do you do? Oh, I mess around with some music videos a little bit. Oh, OK. Well, I'll let you guys enjoy your breakfast, and I'll give you a call, OK? Sure. DON: Hello? Don? DON: Yeah. PAUL: This is Helen. DON: I know. How are you? DON: Fine. How are you? I'm fine. I'm just calling to say hello. DON: Hello. It was funny seeing you this morning. DON: Yeah. Yeah, it was. Have you talked to Max yet about the script? DON: No. No, not yet. Listen, I was just leaving when you called. I meeting a friend at 8:00. Oh. Oh. We'll talk tomorrow. DON: OK. Bye. [DIAL TONE] No. Man. No. DON: So what are you going to do if you can't find it? I'm going to have to buy another car, I guess. You know, you should buy a brand new one. That way you don't have to worry about breakdowns anymore. I can't afford that. Sure you can. You buy the cheapest Japanese car, you make monthly payments. It's easy. Not if I have to pay rent too. My father wants me to move in with him. Do you want to do that? I'd hate to do it. Would he bother you? He wouldn't bother me. He'd just be observing my life. Yeah. Well, you know, if you need a down payment or a cosigner for a loan, I can help you out. It's no big deal. - I'm OK. I can manage. So what do you think? I don't think you should have taken it to Max. Why not? It still needs work. A lot of work. I still don't know where these characters come from. Why is he so desperate for her? He buys her clothes and jewelry all the time. When is he going to let you know? He's having a birthday party on Sunday night. He's supposed to let me know then. You want to come? Sure. Do you want to help me rewrite this? If that's what you want, sure. How much time can you dedicate? I can give you all my free time after work every day, including weekends. Good. Want some more coffee? No, thanks. I won't be able to start before Sunday though, because I have to buy a new car and move into my father's house. Well, that's OK. You can move your stuff over to your father's, if you want, but you really don't have to stay there. I mean, I know you don't get along. You could just live here for now. I mean, we're both going to be making this film, you're going to be helping me write the script, we could save a lot of time. That'd be great, but I feel I might be imposing. No. This is like your place. I want you to be comfortable. I mean, I really had to think a lot about this because we're not distant enough to be roommates, but at the same time, we're not close enough that I would want you to observe my life like you were my girlfriend. I mean, not that I have anything to hide, but-- it's really cool with me. OK. Um, here. You can use this closet here. In fact, there's also this one in case the one outside isn't enough. Oh, it should be big enough. I don't have very many things. Oh, and here you have towels, bed sheets, everything. OK. I'll bring my futon. OK. Hi. Hi, Gary, let me give you the keys. Thanks. I'll send out that deposit in the mail right away. Yes. Thanks for being so understanding. No problem. Wait a minute. Let me help you with that. You know, I'm really glad you got another car, but I still think you should have bought a new one. I know, me too. How much did you put down on it, $500 over the phone. Hey, that's easy. Perfect. What time is the birthday party with Max? 8:00. Where? At [INAUDIBLE] at the Bellage Hotel. Oh, shit. What? That's a formal place, isn't it? Yeah. Why? Ah, you don't have anything to wear. Oh, you've got to buy this one. I think it's the best so far. Go for it. I can't. It's too expensive. Excuse me, how much is this? $950, about $1,000 with tax. That's insane. Why? It's gorgeous. I can't do that. Why can't you have one nice piece to wear? It's better than 10 cheap ones. Don, this is crazy. I can't spend that. I've never ever spent more than $100 on anything. We're going to think about it. Take your time. OK. How much do you want to spend? I don't want to spend anything. I want to buy something and return it. Let's go to the department store. They're not going to have anything like this. This is so different. It's so classy. - No, no. It's irrational. OK. I'll pay half, just add it to the bill. I don't want to do that. Just think of it as rent. You're not paying rent anymore. I know, but I have a lot of debt, and what for? Just one evening? It's not going to be just one evening. You're going to be wearing it so many times. We're going to make this movie. You can wear it to the premiere. I'm really looking forward to it. So am I. Come on. Nope. I can't. Come on, you'll never regret it. Don, I don't know if this is the right time, but I wanted to talk to you anyway. I read the script. Yeah? And frankly, I don't think it's there yet. No? I don't think the characters are sympathetic. I think they're flat. We don't like them. I think we've got to like them. [INAUDIBLE],, you know, they're always lying to one another, and he's allowing her to use him because he wants sex from her. That's fine, but it's not enough. It's not enough. How are you going to show she's faking an orgasm? Well, I felt that would be a matter of acting. I mean, a good actress could do that. No, no, no. That's not the point. That's not the point. I think that we shouldn't know. We should only suspect, just like he does. Yeah. That's good. Also, if he's pretending to be wealthy, she should start suspecting earlier. I mean, things got to keep on coming up like maybe the manager of the apartment house keeps on knocking on the door because the rent's always late, and she sees this. Or collection agency, you know, calling up all the time because, you know, he's late paying for the credit cards. You know, it builds tension that way. You know what to say? Yeah. I think it's much more interesting that way. But, you know, Helen and I are going to rewrite the whole thing, so I think the second draft is going to be much better. Good. Good. I gotta get back to my guests. Hey, happy birthday again. - Thanks. - Thanks so much. Bye. (WHISPERING) God, what a fucking asshole. [ALARM BEEPING] [DOOR OPENING] It's 7:15. What? It's 7:15. I know. Hi. Morning. Here's your breakfast. You're so sweet. It's one time thing only, just to make you feel welcome. Oh, not every day, huh? You don't have to do this. Well, I won't if you start behaving like you're at home. I am though. No, you're not. You're always hiding in the bathroom. Did you sleep well? Uh-huh. What about you? Not really. Insomnia? I guess. Don't you get horny sometimes? Sometimes. What do you do about it? Nothing at the moment. Oh, here's a duplicate key to the door. Thank you. So what time do you think you're going to be back here tonight? About 7:00. Oh, no, no. Actually I have to return the key and get my deposit back. - How long should that take? - Oh I don't know. It shouldn't take long. About an hour, hour and a half? Yeah, I may have to wait. Well, even if I have to wait, it shouldn't take longer than that. I'll be here as soon as possible. It is so stupid. I said just let me mail the key. You can mail the deposit. He wouldn't do it. OK. Well, I'll wait for you for dinner then. OK. God. Oh, what are you doing? I thought it was John. I'm making changes on my script. I don't want him to see me. Don't worry about it. I don't think he's going to fire you. Ted called while you were at lunch. Oh, yeah? What did he say? He wants you to call him. Some guy named Paul called too from New York. He also wants you to call him. He said you had the number. Yeah. OK. You want to see a movie tonight? Tonight I can't. Hey. It's OK. Whenever you got time. [WOLF WHISTLE] Would you like some more wine? A little bit more. You know, I like Don. I think he's talented. Very talented. And the thing is he wrote a very personal script. I just get the feeling he's not telling the whole story. I get this sense that he's afraid of revealing himself. It's very hard sometimes. Oh, I know. But as a writer, he's going to have to open up, otherwise it's not going to work. That's true. And if it doesn't work, I'm not going to be able to raise money for him. He's already raised some money from his family. No. You see, unfortunately, that's not the case. I had lunch with Don today, and he told me he couldn't. Well, I don't know about you, but I'm getting tired of this chair. Would you like to go in the other room? Yeah? Come on. What kind of music do you like? What do you got? Classical. Fine. [MUSIC PLAYING] It's pretty, isn't it? I haven't heard it before. My favorite piece. What? You smell good. Thanks. Does that embarrass you? You taste good. Oh, you know what? It's 10 o'clock. Don must be waiting. Why don't you just pick up the phone over there, call him and tell him you can't make it. I can't do that. Why not? Hm? Are you really interested in my script? Absolutely. OK. Well, why don't you read it and let me know. You got it. [KNOCKING] Come in. Hi. You have the key, why do you knock? It's just nice to knock. So what happened? Well, that manager made me wait. Yeah? Yeah. He wasn't there at first. It's very rude of him to make your wait. I know. I wanted to have dinner with you, but I was starving. I'm sorry. DON: I just fixed a sandwich. There's some more turkey in the fridge. I'd love some coffee. Why don't you make some? What? You aren't hungry? I'll fix myself a sandwich. Helen, what commitments do you have other than your work? Just asking for the script. - Oh, I know. I know. Nothing. God, I don't want to string you along or anything. Maybe you- No. Maybe you should find someone else besides me to collaborate with you on a full time basis. Maybe. I mean, I don't have any other commitments. I want to work with you as much as I can. Good. I just wanted to know. I would like a day off though. Maybe every Saturday, just to do some laundry or-- Look, I know you have your own life. I don't want you to feel as though you're imprisoned here because of this project. Even Saturday's, if I could find that I could do my laundry here, then we can work like half a day. Good. Maybe you can mark in this calendar here the days when you think you'll be here. All of a sudden, you sound like you don't think I'm serious. I just want to know that you're committed. I am. Good. You know, Don, what is it that you're really trying to say? You know what I'm trying to say. Why is it that so many relationships between men and women seem to be based on business now? Men have the power. Bullshit. Women have the power, especially beautiful women. I mean, why is it that women give sex so easily to powerful men? Not all women do that. Some women. All right, some women. He doesn't think that he can get sex from her, not even friendship, unless he pretends to be powerful so he lies. Not deep enough. Not deep enough? No. In his background, there must be a deeper reason as to why he lies. OK. Help me come up with something deeper. I'm really trying. I can't-- I can't tell you what to say. It's in your heart. It has to come from you. Do you lie? Sometimes. OK. Why do you lie? Why do I lie? To protect myself. I mean, sometimes I feel like I'm put on the spot and I lie to protect myself. This character is lying to gain something, big difference. Did you ever do that? I feel like I'm being interrogated. I don't mean to interrogate you. We just got to find out why these characters are lying. Did you like the new ending? Uh-huh. My mother used to say, whatever we do, there will be consequences. Right. I love that. And whatever we don't. You know, it's really difficult for me to sleep alone when you're here. Me too. But I want to keep my relationship with you professional. Why can't we have both? We can help each other grow. I could maybe tell you more about my life. OK. Why don't we go into my bedroom? Forget this stupid futon. I thought you didn't like him. At first, I didn't. He really bugged me. But then we worked together on a final project at school, and I started to see how much more there was to him. We really went through so much together, and that was exactly at the time Ted and I were fighting all the time. And he cared, you know? But then after I left Ted, he got so serious he started talking marriage. Would you marry him? I don't know. I don't know if he knows what he wants. I mean, I don't even know if I know what I want. And he's changed. When we were in school, I thought he was so idealistic. He was always talking about all these great films that he wanted to make, how he didn't care about the money. Now all he cares about is the money. I hate it. Did Ted know about him? I told him. Why did you tell him? Because he kept saying, if there's another man, I'll understand. I'll let you leave, and I wanted to leave. He blew up. It was such a nightmare. If I went to the market or if I stayed late at school, he'd think I went and him-- to see him, even when I didn't. He'd go. Lip would twitch. I don't trust you. So who else? Then there was that guy that I worked with on that commercial in September. That was crazy. It lasted like a month, and that made Paul angry. He couldn't understand. Are you going to tell him about Randy? No. Are you kidding? He's so violent. He didn't hurt you, did it? No, no, no. He just breaks things. I don't understand that. I keep all my anger inside. Yeah. I knew you were sleeping with Randy. I knew you knew. Why so many men? Because I never had that. I know it sounds like too many, but that's all I've ever really had in my whole life. I always knew you would appreciate what I can do for you. Don. Don. Don, I should go back to my bed. I mean it. Excuse me. [ALARM CLOCK BUZZING] Don. I'm getting out of this bed right this minute. Why don't you call in sick? Call in sick? We spent $1,000 on Sunday and you want me to call in sick? [PHONE RINGING] Video. MALE SPEAKER: Can I speak to John, please? He's not here. MALE SPEAKER: Oh, he's not. Could you tell him to call Ray at 555-3911, please? It's important. All right. [PHONE RINGING] Video. MAX: Helen? Yes. MAX: Max. Hi. MAX: I read your script. What did you think? MAX: I think we've got to talk immediately. What do you mean? MAX: I mean, I have to see you tonight. Oh. Tonight, I can't. I am working with Donald. MAX: Then cancel it. [DIAL TONE] DON: Hello? Don? DON: Yes. This is Helen. DON: What's up? I'm not going to be able to make it tonight. DON: Why not? I'm really feeling bad. DON: What do you mean feeling bad. Why? Just what happened last night. DON: Nothing happened last night. I know. But I want to go and stay with some friends. DON: Why don't you come here and let me talk to you? No. No. DON: I only want to talk to you. I don't feel comfortable. I guess it's just me. I didn't tell you this last night, but there were times that, especially these past few months, that I wanted to die. You wanted to die? I'm sorry you can't understand that. I'm going through a rough time. It's always the same story with you. You're always going through a rough time. I am. I feel you don't believe me. You know what really hurts me? It's that all this time you've been telling me how you had to get your life together first, and yet you went off and slept with all those other men. How come with them you never had to get your life together first? I can't explain that. You can't explain that? I was feeling strong, I guess. You never felt strong with me? What is it you want? I don't want anything. You want to control me. Why would I want to control you? I don't know. I thought that maybe-- I don't know. It's just that sometimes I feel like I'm being taken advantage of. I gotta leave. Come here. - I don't feel comfortable. - OK. Come here. Let me talk to you. We can be friends, but I don't think this is going to work. Come over here. I just wanted to let you know how I was feeling. You think I shouldn't do that? I think you should. Why is it that I keep feeling there's something so deep that you're hiding from me? God, there isn't anything left. I told you everything. OK. I'm sorry. You know everything. I spilled my guts. You didn't tell me anything. I've done everything for you. I don't want you to take care of me. OK. OK, I'm sorry. OK. I'm sorry. I don't know why I didn't believe you at first, but I do now. Really, I do. I have to go. OK. Let me write you a check for half of what we spent on Sunday. I think it's going to make a great little film, and I think women are going to relate to it. What? I don't know why you believe in me so much all of a sudden. Because, what you've written speaks for itself, Helen. I want to put this into production, and I want you to do the rewrite. I'll help you in any way that I can. Listen, you're almost there. I mean, you just have to take it one step further. For instance, I like the way that you took the story behind the breakup of her husband, but the ending still isn't right. If you want us to get a real true sense of her independence, she's got to learn how to take a stand. She's got to learn how to say no, and I don't mean just to her husband, but to all men who try to control it. That way, it will make the character richer. You'll find your ending that way. Now, we've com to the best part. Are you ready? This is a check for $5,000. It's yours. And this is a contract. Basically, what it says is that you have to do a rewrite within 30 days. If I like it, you get another $5,000. If you don't finish it in 30 days, or I don't like it, you still get to keep the first check, but I own the rights to what you've written, and then I find someone else to rewrite it. Is it really that good? Yes. You didn't know that? No. I mean, I didn't know that it was good enough for people to put money up for it. Well, now you do, don't you? You know, can keep the check and the contract for now. I need some time to think about this. Look, if you don't like the deal-- No, no. It's just that sometimes I feel like I've been in this maze, and I kept making the wrong turn. All right. I'll give you a week, Helen. I think it's about time you made the right turn. Excuse me, you're will to stay as long as you like, but may I take this now? We're closing the cash register. No problem. Let me get half. No. Are you sure? Uh-huh. Saw Don again today. Yeah? Yeah. Can you believe that thing about his friend? What friend? He didn't tell you? No. I don't know if I should tell you this. No. What is it? Well, he was hoping to raise half the money for his film from his friend, and they had a falling out apparently over a woman that Don was seeing. You really didn't know about this? He did tell me a few weeks ago that he lost his backers, but he didn't say anything about a woman. Well. So now what? You're the only one who can help him it seems, because he can't get money from his family either, you said. - What family? His family's got no money. You know, Don hasn't been working. He's been living off his credit cards. Helen, I really want to help him, but unless he does that rewrite, I'm-- Are you still working together? Yeah. Well, I think you should help him, Helen. What are you doing out here? Well, it's such a beautiful day, you know? I thought we could talk about the script out in the open. Oh. I got some great news. What? I got the male character all figured out. Good. I think he lies and pretends to have a lot of money because he feels unworthy. Why does he feel unworthy? We could make him come from a poor background. But does he have to lie about it? Yeah. What if he was in love with a rich girl and her family was always condescending to him, so now he's hurt. He thinks that all anyone cares about is money. That makes sense. Makes a lot of sense. He has to learn something in the end though, because not all women are after money and success. I mean, really. Alright. That's why it's important that you stay with him when he comes clean. Yeah, but we don't want to be sentimental here. No, but you can have some hope in the end. Something like a bittersweet ending. I guess. You know, and I like this generous quality about him. I mean, like always buying her things. I like that in people. Don't you? Oh, sure, just as long as there are no expectations though, because otherwise it's-- my father used to do that. - Yeah? Yeah, bought me a car for my high school graduation. After my mother died, I wanted to go live with Ted and he said, yeah, you can go, just leave the car. And I thought, God, what's that? I mean, it's a gift. It's a gift. How did we get onto this? You cold? HELEN: Yeah. You want some coffee? HELEN: I'm going to take you to dinner tonight. Really? HELEN: Yeah. OK. Paul? You remember my name. That's surprising. When did you get back? Last night, like I told you I was going to. Uh-huh. Well, do you want to meet or something, because this isn't a place for me to be-- No, I don't want to meet you. I want to talk to you now. I want to know what the hell is going on with us. Why didn't you call me one time the whole time I was gone? Paul, I can't do this now. Where the hell did you move to? What is going on? Just once, one time in your life, give me one straight fucking answer. Excuse me. Look, I don't mean to be an asshole, but this doesn't have anything to do with you. Look, I just want to talk to her. Randy. Look, I'm just going to call the cops, all right? Well, then, fine, call them. Randy. Please, will you answer the phones for me? Could you go outside? Jesus, I'm gone barely three weeks, and it's like a different world now. You don't want to be with me anymore? Not as lovers. As friends. All right. Why don't we get married? You're being childish. Why? Oh, I'm not good enough? It's much deeper than that. What is it? I can't breathe with you. You're all over my life. I want to be in every part of your life. I mean, isn't that what you want? I guess not. You know, I think it's finally going to work. I'm glad. I owe it all to you. I didn't do anything. All those probing questions. I owe you a lot too. You know, this whole story was based on my relationship with Monica. Yeah? Yeah. And Susan before. What happened? Well, someday I'll tell you. Just make sure you put in everything before you take it to Max again. Oh, yeah. Because I'm not going to be able to work with you on it. Why? Just the way that my life is going now. I thought you liked the new ideas? I do like them. I just can't do it now. Not at this point in my life. You want to move out? Yeah. Where will you go? I don't know. I really want to be alone. You don't want to have a relationship with me? I can't have a relationship now. You can't have a relationship now, or you can't have a relationship with me? I can't have a relationship with you. It's like I have to come clean. I got to take a stand, and I got to make a choice. I think you're making the wrong choice. I'll find out when I'm 50. Tell me. Did you ever think of having a relationship with me? Off and on. When we would watch movies together, I thought, gee, wouldn't it be-- but then you were with Monica. I didn't know that you were interested in me. I was. I kept getting mixed messages. I'm sorry. I give out mixed messages? Yeah, you most certainly do, and you do it on purpose. At least, you always did it to me. Why would I want to do that? To get wanted and to keep me at bay. I don't think you ever had any intention of sleeping with me. That's a terrible thing to say. And you don't think you'll change your mind? No. Hey. If you ever really did think of sleeping with me, it's just because you thought I could get you somewhere. I am sick of bullshit. I'm sorry. You got to roll this up. Watch it. There's dog shit there. Where? I didn't see that. Don't be mad at me. I'm not. It's just me. You know, I couldn't be there for Ted and he needed me. I was everything to him. He hates his job. He wants me to go up north with him to see his mom for Christmas. Take a little vacation, and that's not going to happen. I couldn't be there for Paul. He also needed me. I just don't want to feel that I couldn't be there for you. Don't worry about me. Are you going rewrite the script? Oh, yeah, definitely. Good luck. You too. HELEN: When I left Donald that night, I couldn't help wondering about the day when I would come back to him with enough freedom to be his friend. [MUSIC PLAYING]
