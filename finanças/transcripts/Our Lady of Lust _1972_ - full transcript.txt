- I love you, Cristiana! - And I'm happy with my Luca! Hooray for love! Love is life! CRISTIANA THE DEVIL NUN Love is the greatest! All right, all right, you win the mile-high club part of the bet. But now it's time for the endurance test! Third round, folks! Thirty seconds. Twenty seconds. - Satan be gone! - Ten seconds. You kids got kidneys of steel, huh? Sixty seconds. Fifty seconds. - Thirty seconds. - Those two, Stewardess! It's despicable! - Excuse me? Excuse me, you two? - Break! - Yeah? - Not everyone's enjoying your little show. - Get dressed immediately. - Why? ls there a law against midair sex? - You kicking us out of the plane? - I'll have to inform the captain. Use a blanket, at least. Game's on, kids! You've still got twenty-eight seconds left! Twenty! - We make the rules up here, so we have the authority to punish them. - Nope, wrong. They're disgusting! Hey, it's all perfectly natural! It's just like eating or sleeping, ya know! I bet you'd pay good money to be in her place, you old hypocrite! I would for sure! - The state of our society! - I wish my husband was that manly! Thirty seconds! Twenty! Mission accomplished, guys! - I can't believe this! - If it were for my husband... All right, kids? Stewardess? Stewardess? We'd like a nice eggnog, please. Make it double! Almost time for an encore, people. Attention, this is your captain speaking. Please, fasten your seatbelts. - We're crossing a zone of turbulence. - Get bent, chaffeur. Please extinguish your cigarettes. Be seated and remain calm. - Gimme a break. - Now be a good girl, Cristiana, if you don't want a spanking. - What about some fun? - Good idea. - Give us a nice ballad, maestro. - Aye aye! ' Help! ' My God! - Don't panic! - Help! Calm down, in the name of God! Do something, Luca! Please, do something! - Help! - Somebody help us! I don't wanna die! Repent, my children, repent! Pray, my child! Only the Lord can save us now! Save us, Lord! I swear I'll lead a new life! I'll change my ways and stop sinning! I swear I'll remain pure! I'll take the vows... Like you. Save me, Lord, and I swear I'll become a nun! Attention, this is the captain speaking. The danger has passed, we've managed to extinguish the fire. We're also finally out of the turbulence. You can relax now, the worst is over. We made it. We're safe! We're safe! We must thank the Lord for saving us! Our Father, who art in heaven... Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come... - Thy will be done... - My child... - on earth as it is in heaven. - We're safe. - Let us thank the Lord. - I made a promise to God. Let us thank Jesus. O, light of the Lord, fill the hearts of your servants with joy. Amen. You'll never resist temptation. Stop arguing, Mom. I made a promise to God and I'm going to keep my word. This is madness. You have neither the inclination nor the calling for it. We aren't the kind of women who could endure living in a convent. God chooses the purest souls. I mean, you're lovely, but you're not fit for that kind of life. You're too carefree, too assertive. God will accept me just the way I am. You're so stubborn. You'll waste the gift of your beauty by burying yourself alive in this convent. - Anything else you want to tell me, Mom? - No. You're just throwing a tantrum. I know you'll come back home. Nature has been generous with you. Wasting such gifts would be dreadful. Mark your mother's words. You'll never resist. That one. Her face is perfect. Lovely features. Sweet yet strong at the same time. She gives the impression of a very troubled personality. As if she's facing some inner struggle. That's what makes her the ideal model. There's no virtue without an inner struggle, after all. - She's perfect. - You may use her, if you wish. Mother Superior. A sophisticated beauty. The classic image of virtue. My name's Massimo. Ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum, benedicta tu in mulieribus, et benedictus fructus ventris tui, lesus. Sancta Maria, Mater Dei, ora pro nobis peccatoribus... Come here! Come on! Take a chill pill, guys! We're camping here! Right on this cool clearing! Where are you, Giovanna? Are you sure about hearing God's calling, my child? You'll have to take the vows. Are you sure about your decision? I've made my choice already. God's calling and mortification of the flesh, right! Venus in a convent! Crucified! I made a promise! To that Jesus dude who died 2000 years ago? Vows are dumb! Forget it, it's all over! I can't cheat God! That'd be pretty sacrilegious, huh? I'm not turning back. I will not. My child, vocation shouldn't be a challenge. I've already made up my mind. You'll have to give up everything. This kind of life could be suffocating for you. Sorry about that. These are just professional caresses. And innocent. Ave Maria, gratia plena. But I must confess I've never been so fascinated by virtue. And I confess I've never seen a painter of sacred art so hypocritical. That so? Well, luckily, I count myself among sinners. What about you? You really willing to live your life in this place? Does Spring make you feel hotter? God's will is the only thing I care about. You must be the personification of virtue if you managed to put a lid on that fire. That's enough! Hey, did I say something wrong? What's wrong with her? Is she okay? Is she a little nutty? You'll resume your work tomorrow. - Turris eburnea. - Ora pro nobis. - Domus aurea. - Ora pro nobis. - Foederis arca. - Ora pro nobis. - Lanua coeli. - Ora pro nobis. - Stella matutina. - Ora pro nobis. - Salus infirmorum. - Ora pro nobis. - Refugium peccatorum. - Ora pro nobis. - Regina Angelorum. - Ora pro nobis. - Regina Patriarcharum. - Ora pro nobis. - Regina Prophetarum. - Ora pro nobis. - Regina Apostolorum. - Ora pro nobis. - Regina Martyrum. - Ora pro nobis. Regina... You really wish to live your life in a convent? You must be the personification of virtue, if you managed to put a lid on that fire. Does Spring make you feel hotter? Does Spring make you feel hotter? Does Spring make you feel hotter? Eros! Eros! Eros! Your blood and your senses are going crazy! Fiery blood. Fiery. Fiery. Hooray for love! Love is life! I'm crazy about Luca! Crazy for love! Love!Love! My lovely, beloved snake... Come and get it, Miss holier-than-thou! Come and save yourself! No! Come and get it! No! We all have bad dreams. You shouldn't be ashamed. Even we nuns have trouble suppressing our instincts. I've tried praying to fight my temptations. You can confide in me, if you want to. We can be friends. Do you want to change beds? I'll put you in the one next to mine. That way you won't feel alone. You'll just have to move your hand to feel my presence. Try to relax. Let's get some rest. You can trust me. Come on. There. You can dream of God's love now. And pray him to make you stronger. All these rules about virginity are so dumb! We're almost in the year 2ooo! Better to marry than burn if you can't resist, like St. Paul said. We should take pride in the beauty and harmony of our body! It's the glory of our Lord! Why do we hide it like it's something shameful? We even put underpants on statues! We renounce the flesh for the joys of the spirit. We can forget about our fruit with all these bumps! Help! Cristiana! - Are you all right, Cristiana? - I'm grand! The water's pretty shallow here! I'll help you out! Here, take my hand! Time to take a cool dip, Sister! Bathing in public is against the rules! We'll have to do a penance! A bad cold, by the looks of it! Shower and laundry in the same go! Let's get out of the water, you nut! Now we'll have to do a striptease to get out of our clothes! At least this place is secluded! Who would have thought falling off a bicycle could be so fun! Maybe it's this beautiful sun that's making me act so crazy. "Oh, delightful, cruel Spring who rekindles our wounded senses..." Hey, I've never read that passage of the Bible! Time to play a little! "L forbid you to eat apples, my children, for they are a fruit of sin!" You're so wet, aren't you cold? A little. I can warm you up, if you like. Cristiana. Surprised to see me? What a divine touch you have. Such a pity this is my last chance to enjoy it. I'm here to say goodbye. My masterpiece is finished and ready to go down in history. I'm going back to my world. Cristiana, would you like to see the world again, and in my company? The painter and his model. So? Yes or no? Farewell, Cristiana. Let me give you my final thank you. Whose turn is it to ring the bells, Sister? Cristiana, a novice. She's still getting the hang of it, but I'm sure she'll get by. Listen. Well, we've been pretty busy for today. You must forget about all this. You must suppress your wicked thoughts, little nun. I've never made love like this before. Lovemaking and ringing the bells in the same go. I'm gonna miss you, Cristiana. As my model and as my lover. Massimo! Massimo, don't leave me alone! I'm begging you! I'm sure you'll find happiness in this convent one day. No, I'll never be happy here! Please, don't leave me! Pray for me. Massimo! I can't resist, Jesus. Forgive me, Lord, because I'm not worthy of you. You have created everything and know all things, so why do you let a slut like me keep on sinning despite choosing me to serve you? Give me the strength to renounce the flesh! Don't condemn me to eternal damnation! I'll soon prepare this altar for your clothing ceremony. Aren't you excited? I remember it was decorated with so many flowers when I took my vows. It was two years ago. Same the year before that. When I heard God's calling. Really? I was waiting for him at the altar. Standing there with my white veil. I can still hear the wedding march. But Gerard didn't come. He left me at the altar. That's how Sister Leonora came to be. At least you felt a true calling, if you get what I mean. God kept you all to himself. Yes, you're right. You could have been just another average woman. But God saved you from a life of middle-class mediocrity. You must feel very grateful. Honored, too. It's not something that happens to everyone, after all. I'm not worthy of the love of Christ. But... There's a big difference between God's love and Gerard's. The difference between spiritual and physical love. So many religious devotions are born out of romantic disappointments! It's so wrong! They always tell us that our will made us hear our calling. Was your will strong enough, I ask? I don't want to think about it. But if your Gerard returned, if he actually wanted you back, - who would you choose? - People are fallible. But God... God can see inside us. He can see the truth. Knowing how to deceive others is a necessity. It's essential. It is, indeed. Being honest is just asking for trouble. But feigning devotion and self-sacrifice, well, that's the perfect way to be loved by others. - It's the way to live in peace. - I don't want to be an awful hypocrite. - I'll never get used to it. - I know it's not easy faking all the time. It takes great acting skills. We don't want to wake them up. Come closer. We can only be honest with each other. The holy rules would forbid our friendship. They'd forbid even the smallest bond between us. No matter how innocent. That's just what we need, so we won't feel too bad for everything we gave up. We could take some comfort in a little intimate bond. You can't suppress your natural instincts. We have to help each other. Cristiana! There's a phone call for you. It's a man. - A man? - He said he's a relative. Our rules don't allow private calls, but we'll make an exception. He said it's urgent. Go on. Keep walking, girls. Don't forget, my child, that you have renounced the outside world. I remember. Hello? Luca! What a pleasant surprise to hear from you! Am I happy here? Yes, I am! Just a second. Give me some privacy, Mother Superior, please. No, I don't know. I don't know. I'm not sure we can see each other. What did you say? Yes, all right. Yes, I understand. All right. You look so upset. What's wrong? It was my mother. She insists I return home. Poor child. How brave she is. Luca! I'm here! Luca, I'm here! Come! I'm here on the wall! Luca!Luca! Here I am! At last, my love. Keep kissing me. I have to make up for lost time. Locking yourself in this place was a dumb idea. - Can you find me some hiding place here? - Why? What happened? We got pinched in the middle of a heist. You know how it is. You jerk. Daniele shot a cop to bits. I got lucky and managed to skedaddle. I'll hide you in the bell tower until I think of a better place. Boy, we're getting soaked up here. This way. You'll be safe in here, come in. I'm the one in charge of the bells. I'll bring you everything you need. Hey, this place looks cozy. You're awesome, honey. You mind, Lord? Thanks! Truly divine lodging, too bad there's no elevator! - Feel free to use the roof, as long as you don't corrupt the others! - You're great! Come here, babe. Honey. I feel like I haven't held you in my arms in ages. Don't say anything. I wanna enjoy you and feed on your beauty. Cristiana! Where have you been? You're soaking wet. I demand an answer! You're not even attempting to explain? - Good night. - I'll have to tell the mother superior. She asked me to watch over you after that phone call. I know it wasn't your mother. I thought there were no secrets between us. Don't you trust me anymore? I'll tell you, but now I need some sleep. I'll find you a radio, so you won't get too bored. A pair of binoculars, too. That way you'll see me when I'm walking down there in the cloister. Stop talking about that damn cloister. You can't really bury yourself alive in this place. I'll take the veil next week. I won't chicken out. It ain't wise to take the piss out of God, Cristiana. Quite the opposite. I'm keeping my promise. Right, the religious calling you had while shitting your pants up in the sky. I'll never feel alone as long as you're here. I couldn't have asked for a better situation. You want to keep me locked up here forever? I'd feel like a pig being fattened, or a stallion ready to satisfy your desires. Would it be that bad? You're loved, spoiled, and pampered here. I couldn't ask for a more lovelyjailer, you know. But wanting to divide yourself between God and a crook like me is a bit hypocritical. I've heard of hermits who lived in penance and chastity atop a column for years. Ancl you'd like to keep me up this bell tower. They were running away from temptations, you're running away from the law. But no worries, I won't have you endure penance or chastity. Oh, I'm so touched by the privilege, I might feel God's calling myself. How does Father Luca sound? Even the devil wore the robes once, but he didn't fancy holy water! Leonora. You followed me. I also have the key of this bell tower, you silly child. - How long have you been spying on us? - No more secrets between us. Isn't it better? - You the mother superior? - No. I'm just a friend. My name's Leonora. Nice to meet you, I'm Luca. I feel a bit embarassed. It's all my fault, you know. Cristiana has nothing to do with it. I actually suspected it was you. I saw your picture in this newspaper. Damn it. "A dangerous suspect on the run for a ghastly crime." I'm screwed. - I'll get out of your hair. - No need to. We certainly don't wish you to go away. Besides, helping someone in your condition is an act of compassion. And if you keep my friend entertained in the meanwhile, even better. Is that so? Well, talk about unexpected developments. We always try to be open and understanding in this convent. Time for the daily meditation. Let's gO Pray- - Wait a minute, Sister Leonora. - Yes? I wanted to thank you. - I swear I won't be a bother. - And we'll do our best to serve you. Oh, by the way, I thought that a young man like you might need cigarettes. - Take them. - Thanks. Not a great brand, perhaps. I had to steal them from our humble caretaker. You're a delight. Spoiled and pampered by two nuns. Well, what do you know! See you later. Here you are before God, my dear children. The day before your vesting ceremony. The day your life will change forever. Tonight you'll have to make a decision. Pray and ponder. You're still free to decide between the outside world and the convent. Free to choose a life of physical love and maternity, or a life dedicated to charity and helping others. A life of spiritual maternity, if you will. You'll love the Lord through sacrifice and compassion. But he'll reward those struggles by giving you a sense of inner peace. The chores in the house of the Lord are light, as long as you do them with joy. If you're still undecided, you can wait until you hear his calling again. Would you throw our love away, Cristiana? Would you walk all over me? I would, Luca. Unless you'd rather hear a lie. You're playing an absurd game. Locking yourself in that convent was the dumbest thing you could do! I'll take the veil next week. You can't erase yourself in this place! I'm keeping my promise. Stop making fun of the Almighty! I made a promise, Luca. I must keep it. I'll take the veil next week. Gloria Patri, et Filio, et Spiritui Sancto. Sicut erat in principio, et nunc, et semper, et in saecula saeculorum. Amen. Ingrid, do you renounce Satan and all his temptations? I do. Go, and set the world on fire with your love. Frangoise, do you renounce Satan and all his temptations? Do you renounce Satan and all his temptations? Do you renounce Satan and all his temptations? Do you renounce Satan and all his temptations? Cristiana. Do you renounce Satan and all his temptations? Cristiana, do you renounce Satan and all his temptations? I do. Renounce the vanity of Eve. Renounce the temptations of the flesh in order to serve the Lord. Go, Sister Angelica. Set the world on fire with your love. - Welcome to the roof, Sister Leonora. - I won't be long. I heard you needed a pair of binoculars. You're so kind. - Your personal binoculars? - Yes. It's one of my innocent pastimes. And the view is gorgeous. Don't tell me you came up here just to look at the sunset. Well, I usually do. Ever spied on any lovemaking couples? How would that make you feel? Would you feel scandalized or envious? Oh, you're so cheeky. Come on, tell me about your urges. The vesting ceremony will be over soon. You won't be able to see Cristiana without these binoculars. These clothes make us look all the same. It feels like wearing a mourning dress. Poverty, chastity and obedience! - It's all baloney! - Stop it, don't be crazy! Do you want the others to find out you're hiding up here? Cristiana's nature is like a wild river, no one can contain it! I know her fiery temperament too well! We've all taken the vows. But that doesn't prevent our temperaments being as fiery as before. The devil ain't as bad as your people say, huh? Speaking of that, what brings you up here? The binoculars. It was the most opportune moment to sneak up here. No one will notice my absence. Between the ceremony and the families, it's all pretty chaotic. Yeah, I get it. You know what the psalms say? W-what do they say? Well, they say something about the road to perdition. That it's a sweet, comfy road. Receive the cross of Christ and serve him with joy. Let this veil guard your purity, until the day of your death. Luca! Luca! Luca, come and see how chic I look! You Pig! - You rotten pig! - Hey, you really look glamorous! You son of a bitch! You should be ashamed of yourself! - You filthy bastard! - You've just got the veil and you're already moralizing! You couple of hypocritical bastards! - Why are you getting so mad? - You slut! Pretending to be my friend! We had plenty of orgies with your friends in the past. What's the big deal? - It is a big deal now, you asshole! - Come on, gimme a break! - You scum! Backstabber! - Cut it out! She didn't complain when she found us! - Come on, cut it out! - She didn't complain because she wanted you! - Shut your trap, dummy, or they're gonna find me out! - Get your hands off me! - Enjoy the show, Sisters! - Stop it, dammit! - See how I cleanse the house of God! - Calm down already! A murderer fornicating with virtue, unbelievable! Follow my example, Sisters! - Calm down! - Cristiana! Where are you trying to go now? You're crazy! Cristiana, wait! Out of my sight, you snake! I don't wanna see you anymore! Crazy bitch, she's stark raving mad! Mind you own damn business! Bunch of snoops! Bunch of pathetic snoops! You've made a real fucking mess, you know? Cristiana! Cristiana, use your head! Cristiana, wait! - Where do you think you're going? It was nothing serious! - Get out of my sight! - Get your hands off me! - All right, all right, I'm scum! Yeah! I'm a pig! I know it, believe me, I know! I do a lot of dumb stuff without thinking twice! But, goddammit, your cockamamie idea of pretending to be a nun takes the cake! I didn't know you were the jealous type, or maybe I just hurt your pride. I'll... I'll have to disappear for a while, my love. Forgive me, Luca! SisterAngelical What's going on here? Who's this young savage? - Go to hell, all of you! - Cristiana! God... Cristiana! Cristiana, stop! Where's that boy going? My God! Cristiana, wait! Stop acting crazy! SisterAngelical Shall I go after her? It'd be pointless. She's a lost cause for you guys. Cristiana is a woman of temperament. Who are you? What are you doing in our convent? Pleased to make your acquaintance, I'm Lucifer. Have you heard about me? Did I upset you? Is it because I'm half naked? That's the latest fashion in hell, you know. I'll get out of your hair now. I demand you explain everything! Lord, it isn't over yet! I'm sick. I'm nothing but a whore! A case of demonic possession! What's the difference between a countess and a whore, Professor? Well, whores are often decent women! Money means power, as long as you have it! Money, gold, silver, anything goes! The ancient poets lauded material wealth and power, you know? Dammit, who stole the keyhole? The case of the missing keyhole, on it! - Hey, it doesn't fit! - We gotta uncork it first! Let's go, Countess. Wait, wait, we gotta uncork it. Talk about a nice Spring evening. I wonder if God has a soft spot for whores. He could fill the heavens with them! Bring out your best bottle! I wanna take a champagne bath tonight! Well, what do you know, if it isn't my dear old daughter! Back to the fold, huh? Cristiana. But... Let me see you. You let them cut your hair! You look like you're dressed for Halloween! No worries, your mom'll fix it! Not many girls can boast having a whore for a mother! And a wealthy one at that! We both are. Look at this mansion! This garden! I earned it all playing bed games! I'm gonna teach you how to make tons of dough, yessir! Money's all that matters! When you're loaded, you ain't got a care in the world! Come on! Your goody two-shoes, holier-than-thou days are over, darling! You scared? I don't give a damn how fast you drive this car. I need some speed in my life. Are you going back to college now? And waste more time? No, thanks. Your pal got pinched, by the way. Luca? He was an asshole. I booked a table for two at Beelzebub's. - Beelzebub's? - Yup. Sister Angelica goes to hell, to say they made me renounce temptations. Water under the bridge, Sister Angelica is no more. You flushed her down the toilet to start having fun again. Hooray for life! Long live damnation! The little nun is wild tonight! Come and see, people! Wine, tobacco, and former nuns are a man's downfall, yessir! Hooray for Sister Angelica, Beelzebub's favorite! Hooray for our little virgin! Hooray for perdition! Hear, hear! Wow, those lips! Our little nun ain't too bad. She's proper hot stuff, man. Atoast to moolah! Here's your crown! - It's for you. - For me? That's right! - I don't deserve it! - You're the queen of devils! Put it on. - Three cheers for the queen of whores! - Good girl. Hooray for Mrs. Beelzebub, the queen of hell! And here's your scepter, as royal etiquette dictates. Take it. Let's drink to Satan, the prince of pleasures! Give us a striptease, girlie! Long live the stripper nun! I'll grant your wish! I'm on sale tonight, peeps! This former nun here is a real bargain! Start bidding! Hooray for Sister Angelica! Hooray for the possessed nun! So, who's the first bidder? Money down! How much will you offer for this former nun? Thinking about making an offer, kiddo? - Take off your clothes, girl! - So beautiful and so insane! Come on, people, I'm open to any offer! Start your bidding, boys! - No ticket, no laundry! - First come, first served! Place the bids! All right, I'll show you some goods, but don't forget I'm royalty! And queens are priceless, ya know! Got some inspiration? You betcha. Hey, photographer guy! Snap away, I want you to capture the whole scene. I'm still free! Fifty thousand! Sixty thousand! Seventy! Only seventy thousand for an innocent little girl like me? Show me some real money, you bunch of cheapos! Stop acting like some damn cheapskates! One hundred thousand! - One hundred and fifty thousand! - One hundred and ninety thousand! One hundred and ninety thousand? You're selling myself short! What about this pair ofbeaufies,huh? Afiery hot kiss, babe! A toast to lust! Show me a good time, guys! Hands off! Give me a little massage, will you? As soft as silk, kid! Real smooth! Don't be so greedy, I'm here for everyone! Next in line, people! Keep 'em coming! Stop patting me on the ass, you. You all ready for the final act? Did any of you offer five hundred thousand? Hey! Yours ain't golden, ya know! It's a fair price, I came down from heaven! Time for the last part of my striptease! I guess not, actually! You're awesome, lil' nun! What about a thousand dollars on a stick? Athousand bucks! I'd do it for half! Lookie here, if it isn't our beloved King of Diamonds. King of this awesome hell would be more fitting. - Nice debut. - Welcome to the club, Lucifer. You've got a thing for young nuns like me, don't you? You old degenerate. I didn't buy you for myself, but for Raphael over there. Raphael! Go upstairs with the maestro and do your best. I'd like to treat you more gently, but it's now or never. - I wonder why my sexual encounters always drag on for so long. - Come on, move it. Wild and subtly wicked. Right what I need. - You'll pose for me again. - Now? Yeah, right now! - Another masterpiece of yours. - Perfect! More like an intellectual piece. I call this "The Possessed." And it made you think of me. You really believe I look that wicked, don't you? A perverted hellspawn, a daughter of Satan. What pose would such a ghoul strike? Come on, instruct me. Drink this, it'll help you play the part. - Here's your pictures, maestro! - Thanks. Wicked and diabolical! What happened to feminine virtue? Pure fantasy! Have a look, they'll give you some inspiration. Jeez, I was crazy drunk, wasn't I? Fantastic. It's your ticket to immortality. Hold the pose! We need to create a devilish atmosphere. - Some music will help. - Ancl a storm to evoke a violent mood. That's right. Like this. Give me a cynical grin. I don't know how! More! Like in those photos! - I can't! - Give me a laugh now! A diabolical laugh! Great, don't stop! A devilish laugh! The evil laugh of someone who doesn't care about heaven or hell, life or death! You laugh at the notions of good and evil! A sacrilegious laugh that defiles everything! Perfect! From virtue to vice! From model of the sacred to image of the profane! From light to the dark abyss! The dark abyss where evil resides! Don't let me fall, Jesus. Don't let evil dominate my soul! I'm lost! I'm cursed, possessed forever! Cristiana! It's nothing. I'm fine. She had too much of it, that's all. Agood rest and she'll be as good as new. Come on, try to feel better. I feel like dying. I'm scared! You're a nun in appearance only. You wear the clothes of a servant of God, but you don't have the heart. You never felt a real calling, only the pain of renouncing temptations. I'm not reprimanding you for sheltering that young boy. It's about Cristiana. Poor girl, so hopeless and desperate. She's going to sink lower and lower. If you believed in eternal damnation you'd be trembling for what you did to her. You're both beyond all possible salvation. The only way you can make amends to God is to find Cristiana and ask for forgiveness. Bring her back to the house of God, to virtue. The way we remember her. The good, devoted, sweet-natured girl. Benedicite. May God forgive you and help you start anew. This is for you. You had a few questions about my business, huh? I'm not in the drug trade. That's amateurish. We all have our own specialty. Take Raphael, for instance, he's a painter who deals in illicit art trade. - Got any interesting pieces? - Well, here's the catalogue. A 17th century Nativity and a Virgin on the throne. They're both worth a bundle, but don't ask me to swear on their authenticity! I never imagined you were such serious players. Plenty other things you don't know about us. - Well, see you later. - Run along. We could be considered, in a way, as international patrons of the arts. Ancl it all works like a charm, believe me. It's a huge playing field, from gambling joints to diamond trafficking. Plus a few other things here and there. Join our organization and I'll cover you with diamonds. Of course. Fiat voluntas tua. What you wouldn't do for money, my little wicked flower. I'd even sell you my soul, clear Beelzebub. Time to go sailing, Captain. Won't you join our party, Miss holier-than-thou? Get ready, come on. - Pass that smoke, will ya. - Go along. - May I? - It's a free country! Hey, get Cristiana in here! - Cristiana! - We hope our games didn't scare you off! Come here and join us, little nun! Care for a puff? Hey, Cassiodoro! Yeah, gimme a good tickle. - Good boy, Cassiodoro! - You live a posh life, doggie! Good boy. Cassiodoro. Good boy. Yes, you are. - Countess. - Hello. It's your turn, pervs! - You still up for it? - You comin' with us? - Ma'am. - Hello. My respects, Countess. The pleasure was brief, but the memories will last forever. - To the next time, my lovely slut. - Bye. See you, pervy- - A token of my appreciation for your talent. - Bye bye. Take it easy, a heart attack is always right around the corner. What a bunch of lousy, depraved hypocrites. Depraved, yes, but very generous. Here comes the professor. The commander of this ship. How's our little doggie Cassiodoro performing? Areal stallion. Pay him up. Got a problem with my business plan? I must be cut out for it. I have my mom's talent, after all. Cristiana is my brightest student. The pupil has already surpassed the mentor. Shit. A reassuring painting for such a respectable club. Unless someone finds out what's really going on uncler the surface. It won't happen. I'm rather selective about my clientele. Say, are you having some signs of remorse? No worries. I got rid of my conscience a long time ago. That's reassuring to hear. Conscience and ideals are useless in this world. Money is what it's all about! Money means power. Ancl it can buy anything, like you say all the time. Put these in the register. It's Sister Angelica, the nun! - The rumors were true! - Boy, she sure smells like incense! Got a taste for rare creatures, huh? Let's have fun! Get comfy, she'll be right with you. Raphael is planning a gig that'd be really up your alley, little nun. Agolden gig, literally. You in? Give her time, you won't regret it. Or I'll just get rid of her. This Gothic vault dates from the 13th century. As you can see, it is a typical ogive with beautiful, converging semi-arches. You'll also notice the external flying buttresses, which were built to sustain the vaulting of the central nave. The perpendicular style of this building and the frescoes are masterpieces of engraving and chiseling. Paleochristian art from the Byzantine period can be considered... It's made in the style of Benvenuto Cellini. Look at all those gems. That's a priceless piece of art. This crucifix dates from 1530 and was carried in procession during the plague. You want me to... Yes. You have a certain familiarity with saints. Stealing something from a statue won't upset you too much. You'll merely have to stretch out your hand. Relax. It'll be a piece of cake for you. Any objections? I've finally hit the bottom. It feels like walking barefoot on glass. Broken glass. An unscrupulous gal like you? Don't make me laugh. Feels like clawing at the heart of God. It's all superstitious baloney, little nun. Get ready to play your role. Above this solid gold tabernacle, you can see the sweet embrace of this Virgin created by Senese artists. - I'm afraid we must leave, Father. - Come back soon, my children. We will, don't worry. May the Lord protect you. (MUMBLED PRAYER) Respice in Cor dilectissimi filii tui, et in laudes et satisfactiones quas, in nomine in peccatorum tibi persolvit, iisque misericordiam tuam petentibus tu veniam concedere placatus, in nomine eiusdem filii tui lesu Christi, qui tecum vivit... (INAUDIBLE LATIN PRAYER) Stop your sacrilegious hands, my child! I command you to stop, in the name of God! Thief! She's stealing the Virgin's crown! Help! Somebody help me! Stop, thief! Somebody stop that thief! Stop her! Open the door! Cristiana! Stop, thief! Somebody bring me my hunting rifle! What a disgrace! Massimo! Massimo! Stop! Stop right there, you scoundrel! Not even one stinking client tonight. How are we supposed to make a living? I'm gonna cut off the nutsack off that fucker who stole my change last night! I'll show him who's boss! Who's that broad? Classy. - Would you believe it? - That's old Rosie in disguise, right? Jeez, I've never seen a hooker disguised as a nun! - That's the real deal, dummy! - Show us your woolen knickers, Sister! From the convent to the streets, what a distinguished career! Looking for your husband? He cheatin' on you? Come back later with the donation box, we ain't seen no clients yet! Go back to your turf! We don't like new faces here! - That broad's cracking me up! - Yeah! - Looking for someone, Sister? - I'm trying to find a girl. - Her name's Cristiana. - Cristiana? A colleague of yours? - Do you know her or not? - Who doesn't know that whore? - Is she here now? - You got the wrong address. She ain't a two-dime hooker, that girl fucks the jet set! But yeah, that slut enjoys stealing our clients from time to time! Sit down and wait, Sister. Better watch out for sex offenders, toots! Say a little prayer for us, will ya? Got any bigwigs you can introduce us to, Sister? - Cristiana! Gotta go, handsome. - Bye. So, you here to fuck some blue collar beefcake? - Did you see the professor? - He wouldn't risk his reputation coming here. What about Massimo, then? You look upset. What's wrong? What have you been up to? Something bad? You in trouble? Give me a cigarette. There's a visitor for ya, Sister Angelica! She's a colleague of yours! Don't keep your superior waiting, Sister! Boy, look at her! What have you done this time, pervy? She's been a naughty little girl! Cristiana. My God, Cristiana. It's my fault you ended up like this. Reached a state of grace, have you? Or maybe you're trying to act like a regular saint? It was a long ago. Do you still hate me? I still feel affection towards you. Ancl pity. I don't need neither. It took me a long time to find you. All to tell you that I'd do everything I can to help you. To help you leave the bottom. Get out of my sight, you pack of whores! Leave me alone! - Find a client to screw and scram! - Fuck you, girl! Leave us the fuck alone, I said! You're nothing but a bunch of dumb, cruel skanks! You should take a good look at yourselves! You disgust me! Please, don't try to do more harm than you've already done to others. And to yourself. The portrait of virtue. Where is my portrait? Still hanging in the convent to inspire other young nuns? Scratch it off the wall! That part of my life is over! That's the past now! I've chosen to roll in the mud instead of being locked in that convent! Yes, and I enjoy it! I'm just a whore! It sounds blasphemous to your ears, but this is the only way of life I know! I enjoy it, damn it! - Looking for a good time, kid? - I'm the right girl! Pick me! Holy shit. - I wanna try those two gals! - Wouldn't be wise, kid. Skedaddle. - Mind your own business, I'm goin' in! - I'm warning you, boy. I'm fed up with serving God, and I don't have any regrets about it! I'm loaded with dough! And plenty of friends! I can finally be myself, without being a hypocritical sham! What is this? Take a good look! I stole the Virgin's crown! I hit rock bottom! Rock bottom, deep down into the depths of hell! I'm cursed. Hopeless! Yes, despair! You'll have me on your conscience until your dying clay! I'll see you in hell! We'll be together for all eternity! Cristiana, you've shocked me but I don't believe this is the real you. I'm not despairing yet, I still have faith in you! Remember our silly little meditations? When we said that there's nothing mud can soil forever? Everything can be cleansed through sweat and tears. You can still stop this madness and turn your life around! Put your foot down and save yourself! The evil laces constricting me can't be cut anymore. You believe in eternal life, don't you? You can't condemn yourself while you still walk this earth! You can't change fate. There's no hope for me. Cristiana. Cristiana! - Ahoy, my sweet providers of pleasures! - Fuck off, buddy. - Fuck you, lady! - Get screwed! Hello, Sisters. Wanna commit a little sin together? Hey, that weirdo's still at it! I'm a lowlife crook, Sisters, but I'm very pious. Let's have a heavenly quickie together, shall we? Here. - Scoot over, I'm driving. - Hey, don't push me! - My place is in hell. - God is merciful. - Let's go somewhere nice! - All the way to hell! Cristiana! - She just needs to vent a bit, Sister, don't worry. - Whatever, she's a nutter. Slow down and take it easy, I'm in no hurry to get to hell! Slow down, I feel like puking my lunch! Slow down! You're on the wrong side of the road! Stop the car! You're crazy! There's better ways to relax, lady! Slow down, you crazy bitch! You're gonna kill us both! Slow down, dammit! Fuck this! Fuck you and all the nuns like you! Stop the car! I wanna get off, stop it! Stop the fucking car! - Fuck, now she's talking to herself! - This is my redemption! She's ranting! I'll jump out! Holy crap! Lemme take the wheel! Lemme take the wheel! This broad's got a suicide wish! I'll jump! Stop or I'll jump, goddamn it! A babe with a suicide wish, for fuck's sake! I'm going to fucking jump out before it's too late! I only wanted a good screw, not a broken ass! The flower of evil. The flower of evil must die! The flower of evil must pay! The flower of evil must die! The flower of evil must pay! The flower of evil must die! She wasn't meant for the ecclesiastic life, but for love. Her impetuous vitality was like a wild river that nobody could contain. She was so unfettered, so funny, so crazy. Subtitled by Francesco Massaccesi
