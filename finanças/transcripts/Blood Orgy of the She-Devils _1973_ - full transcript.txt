- (ominous music) (intense ominous music) (strong wind blowing) - Water on earth, where you are cast no spell, no adverse purpose last. Not incomplete a code with me as my word so mote it be. Blade of still I conjure thee, run all things as named by me. As my will so mote it be (upbeat drum music) - Kill, kill him. (man screaming) (ominous music) (car engine revving) - See you in an hour. - I'll be here. (crickets chirping) - Good evening Reb, come with me - Is Sharon here. - Sharon is in the next room and treating the god of Vissago to show her the future in the crystal. (suspenseful music) - Who's Vissago? - Vissago is one of the 72 demonic intelligences who has been known to witches rom time immemorial. Formally ascribed to him in the proper manner shall see you. But sometimes they're not prepared to accept what he has to show them in the crystal. We must prepare ourselves spiritually. If you are to see and read your past lifetime sometimes you will see strange and weird phenomenon. (suspenseful music) Concentrate intensely on the psyche, in the center of the forehead and search for your distant past. (intense suspenseful music) I am sorry to keep you waiting. - It is our pleasure. We have been most fascinated by your assorted collection of these objects of intrigue. - Thank you. These are the tools of my profession. - I understand that you possess many occult powers. - Nothing more than most people possess. Some develop an ability to control it. Others do not. In the days of medieval Europe and especially England, strange things occurred where witchcraft was suspected, but could never be logically proven. - Power is something you cannot see, but are aware of in many way. - I have a wish to accomplish something, without leaving a trace of any nature or sort. I wish black magic to be performed. Torouk, bring some wine. Because I know the source of your knowledge of me. I will continue this discussion with you. Say for that, we would have nothing further to say. - Forgive me Mara, but I'm a total disbeliever agnostic. However, it is better to attempt witchcraft possibly than risk open moves against the adversary in this particular situation. Your good health. A witches power has been known to sink a ship at sea, or cause death many miles away. - These powers have been with us always. - Forgive me, but how can I know of such powers? - You are a fool, but then one of weak mind little more could be expected. What words thou wish in the way of proof. - A little token of your abilities, anything. - Your wine glass, look and watch. (suspenseful music) (glass shattering) - This is his picture. He's name is Yolbe Duple, ambassador to the United nations from Rhodesia. He must die before his mission is accomplished. There must be no trace of evidence. It must be positive and full proof. - That can be accomplished with an appropriate fee. - I have been led to understand that sorcery for a fee or financial gain or even silver would make you without power. 40,000 rupees when the job is finished. - Not enough. I want 10 times that much. $30,000 in hard United States currency. - When the work is accomplished. Good day. (ominous music) (intense ominous music) - Jake, what are you doing here? Jake, what is the matter with you? - Die, die little (indistinct). (indistinct) to die. (woman screaming) - Shut up. Enough (indistinct). Thank him for what he has given you. Oh, thou great and holy Vassago her life since be depart into thy proper place. We thank thee for the light thou has show to us. Return to eternal peace. (ominous music) - I can't help identify with it, Mark. It was too real. - You know what I think about all the occult hocus. - There's far too much to it to deny all of it. - Look Lorraine, now, anybody can make themselves think or believe anything. If you're talking about an accredited doctorate divinity or even a religious preacher, that's one thing. - Look. tomorrow night Mara's holding a seance where she calls upon her Indian spirit guides. They speak through her to everyone there. - What do you mean they speak through her? - They take over her body. She has one Indian spirit guide and another one is a great ancestry, like Jessica. You will come, won't you? - No, count me out of it this really, I don't believe in it, besides, - Please give it a try. - You know how you can con me into things like this I'll never know. (suspenseful music) - Before we begin, let me explain to all those who have not been with us before that I am about to call upon my spirit guides. My Indian guide, Takawana and my ancestral aunt, Jessica. (thunder rumbling) My body will host them and they will speak to each of you throw me. I am not aware of what they are saying, and I shall have no memory of it later. You may ask questions during the visitation and speak free with the spirit. (thunder rumbling) We shall begin. (dramatic music) (intense dramatic music) (Mara groaning) (thunder rumbling) You squaw by right hand. You hear me? - Yes. - Ooh, no, have here. Me try answer you questions. Me help you. White squaw, you no be going have papoose. You carry papoose inside two months then no more. You no fear, you no cry. If papoose live, he die before one year it better he die inside two months, you go by sleep room in tipi pine falls hair you burn on the hair and fire. (thunder rumbling) - Yes, yes I'm burning - Next one, you hear me? - Yes, I hear you. - You glad you come by my tipi? Sit by my fire. - Yes, I am. - You'll make plan to see friend far way. - Well, yes, I planned to go to, - We know. - Plan go cross big waters come days of warm wind. Plan see friend no. - Well, yes, to Hawaii this summer. - Now you hear me close. Your stay. No take the tiny bird cross big waters. - But why? - If you go cross big waters in days of warm wind you die. You die in big water. You go cross big water, one moon past cold wind you no die. - Thank you, Takawana. - Next one, your hear me? - Yes I do. - Why you come? - I'm curious. - No, white brave not speak truth. - You come maybe little white squaw happy. (dramatic music) (thunder rumbling) - Now, she's Jessica. - I'm not here to frighten you. I'm here to help you. Young woman, young woman do not fear. I have word for you from one who is in eternal light. A pretty woman with long flowing white hair. - Mother. - [Mara] Yes, your mother. She has a message for you. - What is it? - She wants to tell you not to be sorrowful, but there is one for whom you seek advice from many medical doctor. - My father. - You must give up searching and trying to make him well. The one you call mother prays for him to be with her in eternal life. He will be with her before three months. They will be happy. You will be sad. Your mother and the eternal wants you to give him love, much love and a big close till the end is near. Then do not mourn, but rejoice in their happiness. - Anything else? (dramatic music) (thunder rumbling) (ominous music) - My God, it's a ghost. - Look. - No, no. - Mother has finished. There's no more, it is now time to go. (frogs croaking) - Well, what do you think, Mark? - I dunno, some things are hard to explain away easily. - The things that can't be explained it frightened me. - You know Dr. Helsford is up in all this. I had them in theology last semester and get carried away in class and discussions of the black cards and the white magic. I'd like to talk to him. - Hey, do you suppose he'd sit in on a session or a class? - I'd like to talk to him. Let's go. (engine starting) (ominous music) - You who infuse hate and propagate enmities accomplish that which is demanded of you. I work for the death and destruction of one to whom this picture belongs. It is not that does this deed. Oh great (indistinct) one. (bright music) (indistinct chattering) - You'll see as a matter of the utmost agency that these problems we face must be recognized by the United States. - Ambassador Duple, I'm sure if the president hears of the difficulties in the proper light. - I was a fool to entrust such a delicate and pressing thing to a woman who calls herself a witch. It's most certain that we have to take measures ourselves. - Hear my plea. I now command thee. As my will so mote be. (Duple groaning) - [Woman] Do something. - Someone better call an ambulance. (siren blaring) - There is no other way. One with this sort of power can turn it against you. She is too dangerous to share our secret. - Let's go to work, baby. - Do not left the ugly one see you enter if he does, you must kill him. Leave no witness. (suspenseful music) - More of this? - Mara tell me what's it mean? - I'm sure it's a mistake. You meditate for a time. Use the fire and what I taught you on meditation and the powers of Karma. I shall return shortly. (ominous music) (gun banging) (dramatic music) (intense dramatic music) (gun banging) (cat yowling) - Torouk, Torouk, rise and be of service to me. (heart throbbing) You're not harmed, you have been given to me by Lucifer. You are whole, you are among those who cannot die. Rise Torouk and follow there is work to be done. (ominous music) (suspenseful music) (intense suspenseful music) - Check. - That's a good move, Mike. Isn't that a good move, but not good enough check and mate. (laughs) - That is the shortest Chase game I've ever seen. I'll power the (indistinct). - One of these days doctor I'll get you. Even if I have to use black magic on you. - A great deal has been achieved from the power of magic, both black and white, actually in the mind, the powers are the same. In one hand it's used for evil gain, we call it black magic. And the other hand, when it's used for good in life we call it white magic. Essentially, the workings are the same. With positive thinking and deep concentration many good deeds have been achieved. Sometimes the results are so outstanding that they've been called miracles. - Doctor, do you believe in any of the ACO histories? - Such as? - Necromancy. - The raising or communication with a dead. - Well, what about Numerology or astrology, voodoo, witchcraft. - A few people have mastered astral travel, reading of the (indistinct), abilities in ESP some became famous, some went mad, like Mesmer and some with total conviction and concentration, were able to achieve the impossible. Today's, witches healers and what have you are generally well-educated and mean to do well. And of course we have the fakes and charlatans who play on the weak mind and susceptible people. And these are the ones that we must stop. - Well, how do you propose to do that? - Education of the masses. - That won't be easy to do. - No, as a matter of fact, it could be very difficult. I wonder where Mara fits in. - I'm not sure, shall we have a brandy? Here we are. Make yourselves comfortable and I'll fix the drinks, all right? - Not for me, thank you. - No. Mark, you'll have one. - Yes, sir, thank you. - Well, what about tomorrow, Mark? - Well, Lorraine has talked me into attending the session at Mara's tomorrow night. - Well, don't take it too lightly. - Listen, I may learn something about myself. - Well, he goes to the witches and warlocks. May they someday use their powers for the good of man rather than evil. - I name the birth. I conjure the power from the four corners of the earth. Escape not the living likeness for death I ask for thee. (ominous music) (intense ominous music) - What the hell is wring with you? - As my will so mote it be. (man screaming) (dramatic music) - Oh, (indistinct), I name the Roudonners. From the four corners of the earth, I conjure the power, escape not thou living likeness the death I ask for thee. As with the likeness, so mote it be. As with the likeness, so mote it be. As with the likeness, so mote it be. As with the likeness, so mote it be. (suspenseful music) (intense suspenseful music) (man screaming) - An autopsy on the ambassador revealed the cause of death has water in the lungs. The same as that in a drowned person. However, the puzzle remains that the ambassador was not exposed to any water at the time the seizure occurred. Immediate attempted resuscitation failed and the popular 60 year old ambassador was pronounced dead on arrival. Now there's a typical situation where the facts behind the death may never be known. Witchcraft has never suspected and of course, proof and evidence is never left behind. - So this really leaves no trail. How can save visibly the power of the mind? - Well, I think witches get more credit than they deserve for accomplishing things. - Don't be too sure. That's why so many of the accused of the past were put to the torch. If an effigy or likeness of any kind were found on that person or their premises, they were considered witches. - You said even if an animal was found. - Yes, yes. They called it a familiar. If the suspect at an animal of any kind a cat, dog, rat, raven or whatever the witch finder would look for a ward or a teat. - A teat? - Yes, or a Mark of any kind. And that's where the familiar was thought to feed. And if such a Mark were found, the person was put to death. - Almost every one has a ward or some sort of mark on their body. How could that be evidence? - Well, motivated by fear almost anything was considered incriminating evidence. First, they were tortured by water dunking or pricking with a long steel nail or by the fire until I confessed to being witches. Death was the only release from these tortures. - How could a (indistinct) justify murder based on such ridiculous evidence. - People with nothing better to do can be vicious. Witch finders were paid only after the suspect was proven guilty. Consequently, the odds were up by the strange ways they devised to prove guilt. (ominous music) - Do it. (fabric tearing) She is truly a witch. She is guilty, take her down. - I want my son, Jelly. Where is he, where. No. No, don't, no. - Mommy, mommy, mommy. Help me mommy. - Oh, no, not my son. - Mommy. - Jelly. - I not a witch. - It is decreed that a witch should burn. Burn witch, burn. Burn. (crowd cheering) (woman screaming) (birds chirping) - You know, I can't believe such a thing could actually take place in this country. - Terrible enough of those unfortunate ones, but why punish the children? - Because they were thought to be tainted with the blood of the parents. They were whipped and scourged repeatedly for years afterward to keep them clean. But thank God we have no laws against activities like that. - Well, look what we have today. Young minds, looking to the unknown for answers some seeking God with great sincerity, others seeking thrills any way they can get them. If they only realize where their heads are. - No matter what you see do not become alarmed or frightened. You maybe shown one or more of your past lifetime. You may see death or the manner in which it occurred. Since death is the final memory we have of a prior existence. Study now. Concentrate your thoughts on the revelation in the mirror. - I call upon the spirits of the primordial fire to enlighten me. I command you to make known to me the past in the name of Petro, Granet and Jehovah, I call upon you to obey. (suspenseful music) - (indistinct) the power of the almighty God. I command thee Lucifer in name of the most holly and glorious saints to depart this physical host, this body of a woman and be gone. Return to the depths of hell from whence thou did come. - No. - In the almighty and everlasting God in heaven I command you Lucifer most wicked and disobedient of the arch angels, decease and desist within the body of this woman. I curse thee Lucifer to the depths of the bottomless pit. I curse thee Lucifer. Remain an (indistinct) until the day of wrath. I command the Lucifer to depart in the name of the almighty God in the names of all the holly angles I command you Lucifer behold to the lake of fire. Prepare to be damned in the cursed spirits and remain therein for all eternity. So be it. It is no (indistinct). It is no use. Enough. Keep it down. She's lost, stone her, stone her. (indistinct chattering) - No. - Be calm child. The death said the past cannot harm you. There may have been many for in each life there is a death as there will be in this one. (elated jazz music) (indistinct chattering) - My curiosity is getting the best of me, Dr. - Mara wants to take me through an age regression seance under hypnosis, and tonight's tonight. I'm supposed to see into one or more of my past lives and how I died. - It's absolutely fascinating. Well, you're not always successful at first. - Well, being curious is understandable enough, but I should warn you, there's some element of danger When toying with you occult powers. It's happened throughout history, demons being disturbed and bringing death and destruction. They've been known to be quite upset when someone without a just cause by those unable to protect themselves. - That's why Mara has us wear these protective amulets. They're to keep us from harm from the more unfriendly demons. - Well, you know, I neglected to tell you that the doctor is known for his ability to psychometrize objects. He senses them with his fingertips and the vibration that he gets from them tell him many things about the object and the association it has with the people. He wants pinpointed a lost plane on a topographical map by psychometrizing proving that it belonged to the pilot. - When I studied with the Kunas in the islands I found that the use these same powers to build a protective wall like a magnetic field around them to keep them safe from these demonic entities which of course included Satan himself. - Well, you know doctors, there is no question in my mind that Myra has some unusual gifts in the areas of ESP the occult and age regression. But I have no idea about her qualifications or background. - Mara is good and some of the things she does are incredible. - (indistinct) some people devote his entire lifetime to the study of the power of the mind. Some traveled to many countries in the pursuit of knowledge. They live in the monasteries of Tibet in the Himalaya's with an oath of silence. They study for years, they've never developed enough power to snuff out a candle. On the other hand, some followers of the black arts possess the ability to raise the dead or at least communicate with them. Now who's to deny whether the devil possessed their souls or not. - Dr. Thank you, Lorraine we better get going. - Could you possibly come tonight. - Oh, I don't know. - Just in case. - We'll see. (indistinct chattering) (suspenseful music) (upbeat drum music) (people chanting) (Mark screaming) - I assume that what you saw was not pleasant. One advantage of the mirror technique is that everyone sees the age regressing with you, under hypnosis only you do. The others are preparing for the grand Sabbath. If you will, excuse me. I shall see you in the seance room. - There is no question in my mind, Dr. Paston. I would like for yourself, a Royce to meet me. Dr. Everson and I will be there waiting. Yes, well, nothing more doctor. You better come prepared. Good, I'll see you there. (suspenseful music) (women chanting) - He that belongs to the coven of truth, now listen well. Intensify you witch powers with the potion. Drink now of the liquid of knowledge. (indistinct) does not, but dismay. Weaken and dilute the power which emanates from the body and the blood that flows within you. Strip your garments that the spirits may pass freely. That's your witch powers may intensify and pass from you. Oh, the great tend to holy Barselonious bring to bear thine influence under 36 legions of spirits you govern and command. I command thee Barselonious to bring thine influence and presence to our midst so that thee may enjoy the fruits of our sacrifice. ♪Oh (upbeat drum music) (ominous music) - Dr. Everson, I don't like what I see - Boys. - (indistinct). Dr. Paston, this is Dr. Everest. - How do you do? - How do you do? - Dr. Everest this is this is Royce Littleton an expert psychic phenomena. - [Dr. Everson] Dr. Helsford is quite concerned gentlemen. - What seems to be the problem? - Well, I sense, powerful Himalayacal presences. I've witnessed this in the past and I've seen some deadly and catastrophic things take place. There's Sabbath ritual taking place in that mansion at this time. - How was that made known to your doctor? - Two students from the college were confiding in me. - Know anything of the presiding witch your warlock? - Take a look. (ominous music) Now, we were all qualified in our respective fields of mind power, ESP, witchcraft and exorcizing the evil spirits. And I can assure you that we are going to have our hands full here tonight. May I ask you all to take a stand? Dr. Paston, you take the Northern stand. Dr. Everest, you take the Eastern section, Royce, you take the Southern stand and I'll place myself here. If you've ever called upon yourselves for your intensities, let it be now. I feel great harm will come to everyone in this building. Let me impress upon you that the demons have been known to crush those who have displeased or dishonored them, even hurled them through stonewalls. There's too many in there who have no idea what they're tampering with. - We're not here to question or take issue doctor. If you're right for wasting time, let's go. (upbear drum music) - I command the Barcelonious to bring thine presence and influence to our midst, so that the may enjoy the fruit of our sacrifice Descend from thine aboard. Appear and be with us in this hour of great declaration. Descend and be with us. (ominous music) (upbeat drum music) I conjure the Barselonious to be with us this moment. Make thine presence know that we may give sacrifice. - Take the spears. (intense upbeat drum music) - Kill. (women screaming) - Seize and debond thee from this place. I command thee meet God. - In the of the father, the son and the Holy spirit, I ask that all evils be removed from this aboard (indistinct). - I command thee be gone spirit. (women screaming) - In the name of (indistinct) one. In the name of Barselonious, Vissago. In the name of Lucifer himself, I command thee (indistinct) leave this place at once. Return to the ways of fire about which thee out come. (suspenseful music) - I pray to god we're not too late. (somber music) I see no trace of the woman that Mark described as Mara. - Stuck up on the ceiling. (bat clicking) - Pull the bat in the fire. (ominous music) - So be it gentlemen. So be it. (chiming bell) (ominous music)
