A sleazy American with a John Wayne complex and a suitcase full of forged immigration papers was about to trade with some black marketeers. You see, a group of Poles were desperate to immigrate to America, and John Wayne had the papers to facilitate it. But he traded in flesh, in life and in death. I hear there's an old saying in Belgrade, roughly translated as why fear death? It is the most beautiful adventure in life. More prophetic words were never spoken. And as John Wayne arrives to conduct business, the evening events would foreshadow my arrival. - Jesus Christ, Sibulsky, room after room, filled full of merchandise (chuckles), you must be raking in millions. - I am not. - I hear that the underground economy in this country turns a tidy little profit, hmm? Looky here, it helped the common man settle his stomach, a little bit of booze (laughs). Then you give him somethin' to wipe his ass with (laughs). - I am not Sibulsky. - You're not? - No. Sibulsky is not here. He is late. - Mr Sibulsky, please. - Shh, shh. (people chattering) - Tonight, you will not leave for America as planned. Go and report to Office of Immigration. I will meet you there. (speaks in foreign language) - They want to know why they can't go to America. - [Sibulsky] The papers, I need to get immigration papers before anyone can leave. (speaks in foreign language) - The papers in exchange for what you want here. That is the deal, is it not? - That's what Zivkovich told me, yes. - Take your pick. These are the finest goods on the black market, shoes, paintings, carpets, TVs, VCRs, plenty of Nescafe, huh? Movies, do you like movies? Have you seen One Mad Cop? Very popular film in your country, I believe. - Yeah. You see, I don't want your B movies. (DVD clatters) I want something I can't get back home. I'm not exactly Romeo, if you catch my drift. (Weasal laughs) - Oh, I catch your drift. You have come to the wrong place, my friend. Sibulsky would not approve. - Fuck him. That big-shot film producer Zivkovich told me if I brought these immigration papers, I could have whatever I want. Now I'm sticking my ass out for you. - We are not in the prostitution business. - Well, you are now. You just try to get your people into America without these, huh. (ominous music) (animals grunting) (bird tweets) (dogs howling) (dogs growling) - [Kolya] Sibulsky! You must help me. I need to go to America. - No. (dramatic music) - If you want to leave this country tomorrow as planned, you will make this gentleman very happy. (gun clicks) Do everything he wants. - No, no. - You got yourself a deal. (solemn music) (woman sobs) - No, get off. I do what Sibulsky said. I have given him everything. No, please. No. No! No! (sobs) No. No. (woman grunts) Get off! No! No. (stapler clicks) (Ryan grunts) (dramatic music) (gun clicks) - Ah! (speaks in foreign language) - [Sibulsky] I am late for an important meeting with the American, a real cowboy. - [Kolya] (laughs) Sibulsky, what do you know of cowboys, except from the movies? - [Sibulsky] Yes, from your movies. - [Kolya] I have new screenplay. It's about a man who promises to help Poles immigrate but sells them into slavery instead. (woman gasping) (suspenseful music) - [Sibulsky] I told you before. You are the one person I cannot get into America. It is much too risky. - [Kolya] Sibulsky, you're dead wrong! (men grunting) (dramatic music) (fists thud) (men grunting) - [Sibulsky] No, no, help me! Help me (yells)! - (laughs) Well. Well, now that you're all warmed up, and blowing off some of that spit, piss and vinegar, maybe you and I can just pick up where we left off. (ominous music) I don't take rejection very well. Now you got a choice, me or your maker. (gun clicks) (tense music) (dramatic music) (gun fires) (body thuds) (door rattles) Didn't want Sibulsky breathing down your ass about the mess. Takes a certain kind of talent to do what I did. Not everybody can pull the trigger. Ain't like it is in the movies. - [Oliver] Ain't like it is in the movies. You can say that again. By this time, in the morning, John Wayne's probably sitting comfortably on a plane, sipping champagne in first class and whistling Dixie, while the poor Poles, whose immigration papers he most sleazily provided, are no closer to their dream of freedom than they were before. Sure, a select few may escape their country, but they'll be sold into indentured servitude upon arriving in America. Well, I could've told them not much in America's free. You can pay for it with your life. (birds chirping) (leopard growls) (ominous music) (wolves growling) - [Flight Attendant] Please turn. You're landing at the Belgrade airport. Would you please make sure that your seat belts are properly fastened, your seat backs are in the fully upright position and your tray tables-- - [Oliver] Death never takes a wise man by surprise. I never claimed to have extraordinary brains, but I always seemed to get by. My name is Oliver Wright. I'm an actor, the star of One Mad Cop. - Oliver. Wake up. We landed. - [Oliver] At this point, I had never even set foot in Europe before, much less Yugoslavia. But I understood I was popular there. Apparently, One Mad Cop was a big hit on the black market. Little did I know, I'd be an even bigger hit. (people chattering) - [Dark-Haired Man] Who's supposed to be waiting for you? - Haven't got any idea, the director, I guess. - Do you know what he looks like? - Haven't the faintest. - Honey! - Oh (laughs). - What happened? - Oh, the US law. We had to wait for charter from Singapore. Oh, let me introduce you. My new American friend, Oliver Wright, film actor. - Pleased to meet you. - Is that you they are filming? - No, me, they're supposed to be waiting for, and it looks like they can't even do that. - Maybe they came and left when they saw that the plane was late? - Maybe. - Have you got some phone number where you can call and tell them you arrived? - No. - A name, at least? - All I know is the director's name is Kolya Serbich. - Darling, Oliver must come to our engagement party. Lots of movie people will be there. I telephoned information. I found your director's address. (upbeat music) Are you a famous actor? - Yes. To my family. (woman laughs) I was traveling to Belgrade, because I was offered the role of a lifetime, working for Kolya Serbich, the world-renowned writer and director, Academy Award nominee, true auteur, the same Kolya Serbich who was exiled from America, wanted, no less, for murder, after the on-set death of his lead actor. Kolya claimed it was poor planning on the stunt coordinator's part. But the DA insisted it was Kolya Serbich who loaded the gun with real bullets. Kolya was exiled from the US, and he wore that like a badge of honor, putting him in the company of directors like Charlie Chaplin, Roman Polanski. But Kolya Serbich wanted desperately to return to America. Kolya would do anything for his art. So would I. For One Mad Cop, I gained 20 pounds and shaved part of my head. I was intensely devoted to my craft. As I would soon learn, I was like Kolya in more ways than one. - [Dark-Haired Man] Is everything all right, Oliver? Don't forget, our engagement party is tonight, 7 o'clock at the hotel. Bye. - I was about to walk into a thick, tangled mess. The groundwork had been laid, the beginning of the story already told, a dead body even found in the zoo, eaten by wolves. That's where I make my entrance, into a twisted world where art begins when life ends. This was the last day of the rest of my life. (knocking) (man grunts) Excuse me. Kolya Serbich? - Come in. (sinister music) - What time was it when you left the cafe? (speaks in foreign language) - You are American? - And who are you? - Police Inspector Petrovich. (solemn music) - Where's Kolya Serbich? - (coughs) Excuse me. - [Oliver] What's this? - Kolya Serbich. He was found dead this morning at the zoo, apparently eaten by wolves. (solemn music) (speaks in foreign language) - Uh, yeah. I speak a little English, yes. - Speak with me, will you? I'm trying to make mine better. Don't even think about it (laughs). I'm not speaking with you, just practicing - Ah (laughs). You sound like Clint Eastwood. - Good, I'm trying to. (solemn music) You got rid of the scar? - No, we must wait for that. It needs some healing first, but other than that, it's perfect. Perhaps I also will go to America to-- - You know someone who is going to America? - Uh, no, no one. We must be very careful over the next few weeks. Your eyes will be very sensitive to the light. You must wear these glasses for, uh, the next, what's, uh, 24 hours at least. And the implants can be easily moved. So be very careful about what you're doing and what you eat. - I don't eat. I only drink. And just as soon as we're finished here, I'm going out for my meal. (solemn music) Don't even think about it (laughs). (phone rings) - Hello. - [Woman] Mr Zivkovich is waiting. - Who? - [Woman] Mr Zivkovich, your producer. He is in the cafe. - Zivkovich? - [Woman] Shall I tell him you're coming? - All right. All right, I'll be down in five minutes. - [Woman] Thank you. - [Oliver] Tell me, how did Kolya end up in a wolf den? - He used to walk drunk on the wall above the cage. Sometimes, I pulled him off that wall. Alas, that day, wasn't. To tell you the truth, I knew it. I was sitting in a meeting, working on the budget, and all the time, there was something here nagging at me, nagging, as if I could see him. - [Oliver] Why did he walk the wall? - I don't know. He had something in him, something that was crazy. He tempted fate. You want another whiskey? - No, thanks. - You write. I've read your work. Listen, Oliver, why don't you take over the movie? - What? - [Zivkovich] A lot of money has already been put into it. Kolya, he would've wanted it that way. So what do you say? - I met this so-called Englishman. - Yeah? - Who said he'd worked on the screenplay with Kolya. - Kolya told me about you. (chuckles) I worked with Kolya on this screenplay. I provided him with a few interesting facts. - What kind of facts? - About the white slave trader. - I don't now what you're talking about. - About the film Kolya was supposed to make, and you were supposed to star in. - Uh-uh, I don't think we're talking about the same screenplay. Something about, uh, white slave trade. - No, nothing to do with it, nothing. Well, it has, in a way, but they're not white slaves, just Poles. They want to go to the West. Their country won't let them, so they come over to Yugoslavia as tourists to find some good soul who helps them get the necessary papers. That's it. Okay, I want you to put that into the movie. - That wasn't in the screenplay sent to me. - No, it wasn't, of course. - Well, okay, so, uh, what do you really want? - [Zivkovich] For you to direct the movie. - You mean, make my own movie? - [Zivkovich] Your own, of course. - If the movie's mine, I have to write a new script. - Okay, take a couple of days, go to the party, be there at the hotel. What do you say? - Hey, who's that girl over there? - That is Nina. She was to be your co-star in Kolya's film. Is it a deal? - Huh? (solemn music) I have to think about it. - How long? - I don't know, um, till tonight. See you at the engagement party. - Okay, okay. - Okay? (solemn music) So that was my first encounter with Zivkovich, the producer. I didn't exactly trust him. I thought he lied when he said the screenplay was not about the white slave trade. But more importantly, I thought he lied about the death of Kolya Serbich. - Oh, Mr Wright, is room satisfactory? Mr Wright! Your passport. (solemn music) - Why are you looking at me like that? (object clatters) - Sorry. It's incredible how much you look like him. - Who? - Kolya, Kolya Serbich. (ominous music) (projector clicking) - Excuse me! Can someone get me some service? - [Fred] Hi. - Fill 'er up, please. Now. (gun fires) (dramatic music) - Holy mother of God! He's killed her. He's killed her in cold blood! Help, somebody, please! - I'm gonna nail that son of a bitch. (tires screech) Headed down Shadow Road now, I need back up. - Headed down Shadow Road, I want back up. - [Dispatcher] That's not your jurisdiction, O'Shea. - Fuck jurisdiction! I'm one mad cop! - Fuck jurisdiction. I'm one mad cop. (dramatic music) - Fuck you! (Kolya laughs) (dramatic music) (gun firing) Fuck! - No one fucks with O'Shea and lives. (dramatic music) - Fuck! (dramatic music) (projector clicking) (tense music) (metal thuds) (dramatic music) (fist thuds) (men grunting) - Don't even think about it. - Don't even think about it. (Oliver mumbles) (foot thuds) (Oliver grunts) (dramatic music) (wrench clangs) (solemn music) - Fred Baldwin, LAPD. (gentle music) - [Oliver] Her name was Nina, and she was to be my leading lady. I didn't know much about her, but I suspected she knew more than she was letting on. - I am hungry. - You always go to a church when you're hungry? - No, I go to church when I want to surround myself with beauty. Come, I want to show you something. - They asked me to do Kolya's film. - [Nina] Your film. Kolya's dead. (gentle music) - [Oliver] What kind of film did Kolya want to make? - In Kolya's movie, I was supposed to play your mistress. - And in real life, you played Kolya's mistress. (book clacks) (gentle music) Yeah, they were lovers, all right. But she didn't seem too broken up that Kolya Serbich became wolf kibble. (kids laughing) - He used to come here often. He adored the wolves. We'd walk on this wall, sometimes drunk. We'd watch the wolves and talk about the movie. And as he was describing the scenes, I couldn't help myself. I tried to visualize the man I was supposed to kiss in the movie. I wanted him to look like Kolya.

Or do you want me to tell you details about my lovemaking with Kolya? - I prefer to hear something about what you and Kolya did with the Poles. (dog barks) - Butzo. Hello there, Butzo. - Butzo! - Hello there. - Butzo, Butzo! - Hello, Nina. - I am so sorry. She was frightened by the runners. - [Nina] Do we know each other? - Certainly. Only this morning, we were talking about the script I did with Kolya. I hear you're preparing a new version. - [Oliver] News travel fast in this town. - Only sometimes. - This is truly fantastic, Porter. - Thank you. I knew we had the same taste. Kolya liked my little hideaway, too. Kolya was not alone at the cafe last night. The story about wall and walk and zoo is true, but last night, when he left the cafe, he wasn't drunk. - How do you know? - I was there. And I know what is of interest to me. For instance, Sibulsky. - Sibulsky? (Porter laughs) - No, Sibulsky's a guide for Polish tour groups. (Oliver coughs) Do you mind the smell of tobacco? - (coughs) What was Kolya's connection with this guide? - I knew you were going to ask that. - What's this? - The Eastern Channel. Sorry. - What? - The Eastern Channel. That's going to be the title of my article appearing on the front page of The Guardian. - Why are you showing me all this? - Because of our screenplay, dear Oliver. (solemn music) - Our screenplay? - The same one Kolya and I wrote. (ominous music) - Thanks for the drink. - You got it all wrong. - I write my own screenplays. - You can't do it alone in this country. If you think that Russian whore can help you in Yugoslavia, you're sorely mistaken. - Forget it. (tense music) - You're right. She probably is a Russian whore. But that woman is with me, right now, so... (fist thuds) (Porter grunts) I knew I'd run into that screenwriter again. Like most hacks, Porter was obsessed with his original script about white slavery and trading identities. It wasn't in the draft I'd read. And it wasn't gonna be in my rewrite either. (woman laughs) - He's dramatic and childish. - [Oliver] The chance to write my own script was tempting, almost as tempting as Nina. There I was, writing Kolya's script, directing Kolya's movie, and if I played my cards right, I'd end up with Kolya's mistress, to boot. (solemn music) - So? (Kolya laughs) Stop that. - Sandra, why do you even have to ask me who I love more? Nina is yesterday. You are today. - And who is tomorrow? - You, no matter where I am or what I'm doing, it will always be you. Sandra. Sandra! You have the contact lens I asked you for? Excellent. - I don't know what you ever saw in her in the first place. She's just a Russian wore. - [Kolya] (laughs) It's whore. She's a damned good one, as a matter of fact. The moment of truth is at hand. - [Sandra] Nervous? - Nervous? No. - [Oliver] I was thinking about what that screenwriter had said to me. According to Porter, Kolya wasn't drunk when he left the bar, at least not enough to fall into a wolves' den on his own. What was more likely, it seemed, was that Kolya had been pushed. From what Porter had said, this guy, Sibulsky, a Polish tour guide I'd never met, was the prime suspect. You know somebody named Sibulsky? - Yes, he's a guide for Polish tourist groups, officially. Unofficially, he's a black marketeer. He keeps me regularly supplied with Nescafe and other things. Why? - I think he killed Kolya, unless Porter's lying, and it looks to me as though everybody lies here. - I promised you scrambled eggs and onions, and that's what you're going to get. Come. (Nina hums) - Yes. (men laughing) - Oh, Mr Wright (laughs), I thought I might find you here. - What's this all about, Patrovich? - Petrovich. I'm a Serb, not a Russian. And you, as an American citizen, Wright, should not get mixed up in something that's strictly Yugoslav-Soviet specialty. - That being? - The black market. - Oh. I see you've been promoted, Petrovich. Now you've been put in charge of investigating the great mystery of the five Nescafe jars. (chuckles) Shouldn't you be working on the murder, Petrovich? - What murder? - Still the same one, Kolya Serbich's. - Stop playing detective, Wright. Leave it to the professionals. This isn't one of your Hollywood melodramas. Murders really happen here. - I know who was with Kolya Serbich at the cafe last night. Good God, man! I'm telling you Sibulsky killed Kolya Serbich! - Listen, fella. Don't think that an English stringer in Belgrade knows more than the Belgrade police about what happens in this city. The operation works like this. That money you saw is just payments. The big money is in America, where a certain Mr Dianne is known for being able to arrange long-awaited reunions between Americans of Polish origin and their relatives in Poland. According to Smith from the FBI, he charges $25,000 per head. (knocking) Come in, (speaks in foreign language). The key man is Sibulsky, our Polish tour guide. (speaks in foreign language) Dianne sends him a list of Poles whose American relatives want to bring over. The rest of the operation is tightly organized. Try this one with the pate. - [Oliver] Zivkovich. - Zivkovich, international film producer, a man of the world, is the Yugoslav connection to whom Sibulsky delivers the Poles when he brings them into Yugoslavia's tourists. - What does Zivkovich actually do with these Poles? - What? - I mean, what's the scam? (door clacks) - That slob, Zivkovich, hides the wretches into various holes, takes everything they've got and then rents them out as cheap labor to do heavy manual jobs, while deluding them that one day, their dream will come true. Poor wretches don't know that their dream is going to be an unending nightmare, because when they are finished with here, they are given fake papers and transported to America then where there is another Zivkovich waiting for them. - What's Kolya's connection with all this? - I don't know. I'll know when I find him. (speaks in foreign language) Give me file on Serbich. The lab report. The wolves didn't eat Kolya Serbich. Take this to the archive. The wolves ate Sibulsky. Well, my detective friend, that's it. If Sibulsky's dead, then who is alive, Oliver? Kolya Serbich is alive, Oliver. Bravo, Oliver. Now all we have to find out is what Kolya Serbich is up to and where he is hiding.

It told the story Porter had wanted about the white slave traders switching identities for their trip to the West. I figured Porter had sent the pages to me, and since he was the one who got me started on this mystery in the first place, I decided it was time to pay him a visit. When I got there, I could see I wasn't the only one with that idea. (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (Porter gagging) (alarm beeping) (Porter gasps) (Porter gagging) (alarm beeping) (Porter gags) (solemn music) (explosion roars) Things were spinning out of control. Porter was dead, just like Sibulsky at the zoo, and with him, went half my answers. The other half belonged to Kolya Serbich. I still hadn't seen him, but I knew exactly what he looked like. All I had to go on where the screenplay pages. I realized they weren't sent by Porter. They were sent by someone who wanted to get me out on that barge, somebody who wanted me dead. The same person, no doubt, threw Sibulsky to the wolves and cut Porter's throat. That left either Zivkovich or Kolya Serbich, or maybe both. - It's on me. (engine revs) - My key, please. - Does that mean you want to check in again, Mr Wright? - Excuse me? - Mr Wright, I am really sorry. But half an hour ago, you checked out, paid your bill, took your things and left. - Me? I checked out and took my passport? - Yes. - Where was I supposed to be going? - To the airport. I called car myself. - (scoffs) Do I look to you like somebody who was at the airport, huh? (solemn music) - No, Mr Wright. - Call the police. Call the police, Inspector Petrovich. - Yes, sir. (phone rattling) Inspector Petrovich. Just moment, please? - Petrovich, this idiot of a receptionist says that I, I paid my bill, took my passport and checked out of the hotel. - [Petrovich] Did you? - Of course I didn't. - [Petrovich] Why does he think that? - Because he's an idiot. I was on Porter's barge. Somebody cut Porter's throat and blew the barge up into smithereens. - [Petrovich] You have no passport. You have no alibi. I want to question you further about Porter's death. - Okay. - [Petrovich] Stay at the hotel. Give the phone back to the concierge. Hello, hello. This is Inspector Petrovich. Yes, give Mr Wright a room, right away. - As you wish, Inspector Petrovich. - [Petrovich] Thank you. (phone rings) - Hello. - Oliver, why aren't you at our party? We miss you. - I couldn't care less about the party. - [Man] Oh, Oliver, enjoy yourself. Zivkovich, your producer friend is here. - All right. - Nina, also. You will have a ball. - Mm-hmm. - There's music and dancing. - I'll be there. - Please, please. - Bye. (phone clacks) (solemn music) (singing in foreign language) (solemn music) - The real McCoy. French. - Pardon? - Champagne. - Ah. - So Ana, you two are off to America. Never mind, I'm glad. I'm really glad. (dramatic music) (speaks in foreign language) (solemn guitar music) (singing in foreign language) - Oliver! I'm really glad you could make it. (singing in foreign language) - Did you manage to catch up on your sleep? (singing in foreign language) (Zivkovich coughing) (singing in foreign language) (Zivkovich coughing) (singing in foreign language) - I've thought of a great story for a movie, Zivkovich. It's full of twists and turns. The dead are living, and the living die. - Oliver, do you know Mrs Christina Dunne? - It's you I'm gonna get to know, Zivkovich. We're going outside for a little chat, huh? - Nice to see you again, Ollie. Get to you, later. (dramatic music) (speaks in foreign language) (dramatic music) Try this. This is (speaks in foreign language). Try it. Just a minute. And this ham is very... I beg your pardon. Nice to meet you. See you again. (singing in foreign language) (audience applauds) - Listen, Oliver. We are rounding them up tonight, not just here but in Munich and, and in New York. Their local Zivkoviches have been caught too. We exposed a monstrous international chain in white slave trade. You helped us a lot. - What about Kolya? - Don't worry. We are looking for him. His picture is at every Yugoslav frontier crossing. Kolya Serbich may be a wolf, but sooner or later, he's going to come out of his lair. - You know, the key to the whole thing was in the script, Petrovich. - What script? - The one Porter and Kolya wrote. Kolya described it all in the script. He even foretold my death, but that was his mistake. He doesn't know I wasn't blown up on the barge. - Please, Oliver, go back to the party. Have a nice time. And don't do anything on your own. Promise me you won't be alone for a single second. Stay close to people, Oliver, please. - All right. (dramatic music) (audience applauds) (singing in foreign language) - Oliver, you cut your hand. What happened? - When was the last time you spoke with Kolya? - (sighs) Oliver, please, let's not talk about Kolya tonight. - We have to. When was the last time you spoke to Kolya? - What is it? What do you want from me? - When? - Last night. He called to break up with me. - [Oliver] What time did he call you? - (sighs) For God's sakes, Oliver. - What time did he call? - I don't know. It was late. It must've been after three. - (chuckles) There, don't you see? He called you after his own death. - Oliver, what's happening? - Where did he call you from? - What is it? Why do you all keep asking me the same stupid questions? - Who else asked you that? - That idiot Petrovich was at me for an hour. I would like to sing. Leave me alone. Whenever he had a problem and had nobody to drink with, he would usually go to his stripper girlfriend. - That's it. (singing in foreign language) (audience applauds) - [Nina] Her name is Sandra. I will give you her address, but please, Oliver, be careful. (knocking) - Kolya! Kolya, I know you're in there. Kolya! - Amazing. - Kolya! He's gone, isn't he? He's taken my passport and gone. - Please sit down. Let me fix you a drink. - [Oliver] I could use one. (solemn music) (projector clicks) - Well, Oliver. I promised you a film, and this is it. I'm glad you're still alive, so you can see it. I had this idea for a long time, this story of two men who switch identity, and I was telling someone about this idea one day, and they mentioned your film. So naturally, I got the One Mad Cop, and that gave me a whole new idea. As you can see, we look very much alike. So I threw away my script and wrote myself a plan. And I guess I should tell you the truth now. Nina was in those plans. She was told to lead you here tonight, and if you're watching I know she has done her job. You know, Oliver, I've had a difficult life in some ways, but in one respect, I've been very lucky. Women. Women have always loved me, Oliver. Sandra there, beside you now, she has loved me most of all. With such love, how can I not believe in happy endings? I do, but in this script, there is room for only one, and I'm afraid it's mine. (Oliver gags) Goodbye, Oliver. (glass clatters) As they say in Hollywood, you'll never eat lunch in this town again. (Oliver groans) (knocking) - You burned the film he made? - [Oliver] You're a dead man, Baldwin! (gun firing) (Oliver grunts) - Well, what do you know? Boys in blue bleed red. You know what I think, O'Shea? The way you've been acting lately, there ain't a hell of a lot of difference between us. You a bigger crook as I ever was. And me, I'm a regular hero. So does it really matter if you're the one that eats lead? You think about that for a sec. (gun fires) (projector clicking) (solemn music) - Sandra. - Yes? - Sorry. (gun fires) (solemn music) - I understand it's unusual for an immigration official to call in an international traveler for questioning. But this is a special case. Please sit down. (tense music) You just arrived from Yugoslavia? - Yes (coughs). - You were working? - Yes. (tense music) - On a film? - Yes. - Interesting. You look really different. (tense music) In person. You're even cuter. Look at me, I'm gushing. (chuckles) I loved One Mad Cop. You were fantastic. (gentle music) Can I have an autograph? - [Kolya] There you have it, a little mystery, some action, a dash of romance, my best role yet. Have a nice day. Is there a lesson to be learned? Don't take life too seriously. You'll never get out of it alive (laughs). (solemn music)
