Step on it! Tomas Hoffman and Cinemart present Okay, I got to fly. Yay! Now over... Over... and under. A movie by Martin Horsky WOMEN ON THE RUN If you have dirty laundry, you put it in the laundry bin. You sure those weights aren't too heavy for you, honey? Yes. Well, I don't want you to hurt yourself. Mom, please. I know. Kuba, close the door. Who wants to hear this? Homemade waterfall! Get off that skateboard! You'll fall! I won't! You don't mind the noisy pot? Not at all, we just turned up the volume. Stop eating those cookies, we're having dinner soon. Karel, could you pick up Petey from his science club tomorrow? - What, me'? - Yeah, you. You always pick him up. Yeah but I have to go buy new shoes with Kuba tomorrow. - Wait, tomorrow's Thursday. - And? - I have football tennis. - You can miss one game. There's only four of us, they'll be odd, what are they going to do? - You can't go shopping on Friday? - I mean, I can. Well there you go! _ Mom? " Yes'? Did you know that oysters can change genders whenever they want to? I didn't, Petey. I'd love to be an oyster, though. Don't worry, you just might become one. In your next life. Hi! - I have just five minutes. - Just that? Yeah, Kristyna called and said that she bought theatre tickets. Can you lock it up somewhere? - Come, Fanny. - Thank you. - Go to your spot. I'd like to go to the theatre with you someday. Come on, strip down. We don't have time. Here, I'll help. There you go. - What's that perfume? - I bought a new one. Are you crazy? Do you know how good Kristyna's sense of smell is? We have to spray over it. Stay! Wait there! There. I justly buy the same perfume for both of you, so you'll use it. Yeah? But your wife is the one who picks it. Please, it smells nice. Good. Let's do it. Quick. - Would you want me like this? - Fat? No, pregnant. There you go again. It's not me. It's my body. Because the gynecologist said it's high time to get started. The best of the best comes running through the marathon gate, Emil Zatopek. 70,000 spectators on the stands chanting one name. With a lead of more than one kilometer, the three-time winner tore the finish line ribbon. He achieved a great, unbelievable victory in record time... Run a marathon. Vera, can you put it on the list, please? Run a marathon. Dad didn't want to be at a cemetery. He said to dig a hole in our cottage's backyard, pour his ashes in there and plant a tree on top of him. Its roots will become his roots. When I die, pour me out by the roots, too. So Dad and I can be together again. But before we lay Dad down to rest, we should fulfill his final wish. Run a marathon. - What? - Excuse me? A marathon? How do you want to do that? We'll put him in a backpack and run along. Are you being serious, Mom? We'll be running with Dad on our back? He used to carry you around on his back, too. How long is it, anyway? - 42 kilometers and 195 meters. - So long? Well, we'll run it as a relay. A little over 10,5 kilometers for each of us. I already signed us up. Look. - He'll have it officially verified. - Great. The run's in three months, so we'll have enough time for training. Mom, I have a job and three kids and a husband at home. I have zero time for training. At school, I gave up on a 12-minute run after 10 seconds. I'm not physically designed for running. Sorry. Well, and I finally managed to convince Jirka to try for a baby. - No! - Yes. - What good news! - Congratulations! - Thanks. So I'm definitely not going to be running any time soon. - I'll be running alone, then. - Mom, the whole thing is nonsense. - Yeah, exactly. - No, it's not nonsense to me. I'll fulfill Dad's Wish. With or without you. Oh, you're here already. I thought you'd be back later. The young lady came by to pick out something original for her apartment. - Would you want to try it in a trio? - Well? - Well, I wanted to. - There you go. But differently. - I'm missing just the - I'm missing the Damn. Can you stop with that stupid game and eat normally? Why? It's fun. Yeah, it's great fun to find "shit" in soup and teach it to a little boy. Please, he's known the word for a long time now. - Right? - Yeah! He shouldn't look for it in soup, though. Stop being angry and play with us! I know you'll like it. I have more important things on my mind- Yes! I got it! - Won again! - You snake. You failed writing at school but you find shit first. Congratulations. Enjoy the meal. I got it boys! I'm second! Woo! Who's going to be third? Chill out. You did good to bail on that running thing. Huh. Wouldn't have managed to do it anyway. - Why do you think that? - You can't even run to catch the tram. - What are you saying? - It's true. - Mom, you can run? - Of course I can run, darling. - Well I've never seen you run. - Neither have I. Same here. - Show us! - Yeah, show us! - Show us! - Show us, Morn! Show us, Mom! Show us, Mom! Mom is a runner! - Mom is a frontrunner! Yeah! - Mom is a mother! Well there you go. Run into the bathroom. The laundry's done. - I heard it too. - Laundry's calling! You know what? I'll show you. I'm not going to run to get the laundry from the bathroom. You will. Because I'm going to train with Grandma. - Wait, are you serious? - I am serious. Laundry's calling. "Shit." You lost. Can I stay with you for a while? Thank you. Have a nice day! - What are you doing here, Mom? - Marcela and Bara are both going to run! They changed their minds! You're the only one missing. I wasn't built for running and that's how I'll stay. - At least try. - No. Look. - What is that? - A sports bra. I bought them for all of us. This one's for you. - Running will be a breeze in this. - But I'm not running! The worst thing that can happen to a woman while running is sore breasts. God, Mom. - What are you doing? - I already put it on. Look! - It's as if they're nailed to me! - Please stop being embarrassing. A woman should look good in any situation. You're absolutely right. Hello. Katerina, be a dear and make some coffee. - Espresso? - Well, yes. You know what I like. - I do. - Thank you. - You're sleeping with him? - No. Others may be convinced but not your mom. You're breaking three basic rules. Don't sleep with your boss, don't dip your pen in company ink, and stay away from married men! Can you please keep your advice to yourself? Thank you. - You should run him out of your head. - Give me a break with the running thing. I'm not going to do it! And can you go? I need to be working. Yes? Hello! Yes, of course we can help you. I'll look it up and call you in a minute, okay? Goodbye. I'll run her section instead of her. - I knew she wouldn't change her mind. - I would be amazed if she did. Same here. Katerina! I'll only try, though. - It's good! - Yeah? - This is nice. Thank you, have a good day! Thanks, goodbye! Oh, I just remembered. - Do you have backpacks? - Yes, of course. - How big should it be? - Large enough to fit Jindrich. Your dog. No, my husband. Oh, and how big is your husband, roughly? I can't believe this... The European beaver is a large rodent with thick fur. Did you know that there are various types of beavers? - Really? - I'm back! What's that horrible smell? It's nothing. Kuba was playing on his phone and his goulash got burnt. Don't worry, we had buttered bread. You let Kuba heat up the goulash? That's what he got assigned. I was supposed to take care of the laundry. This laundry? No, the laundry I hung up. The laundry you hung up so well that it ended up on the ground out front? - Really? - Really. - You didn't use pins? - Of course I used pins. I wanted to put them on there as soon as it dried. - What? - Look. What a sight, right? Still not enough of them though. - How long is this going to take? - It's supposed to dry for 24 hours, but you can relax, it's already been drying for 2 hours, just 22 left. - Guess we'll have to buy more pins! - Obviously. Other than that, I think the situation's totally under control. Watch. This is living room calling kids. Come give the report on water mammals. Over. Krystof was supposed to help Petey prepare for his science club. Kuba! Butter some bread for Mom! - Mom. - Yes, Petey? Mom, you have an otter? Krystof said that an otter is present in some adult women. An otter? No, not an otter. I meant a... beaver. - A European beaver. - I see. Well. I'm glad that everything is totally under control. Ran out of butter. Yes? Look! Fits right in there, as if they made it just for him. Can you take a photo of us? I want to send a picture to the girls, show them how good we look. Of course. - Thanks! - You're welcome. What are you doing? - I'm looking for the father of my child. - On a dating site? No. In a sperm bank. You want to get impregnated by someone anonymous? - Yes. - You can't be serious. I've been disappointed by men enough times. - These ones won't disappoint. Hurt. - They won't caress, either. - Tell you how much you mean to them. - The ones I had never did that anyway. Do you know how long it's been since I received a flower from a guy? It's been so long I don't even remember. I don't want any more disappointments. I'll just choose my preferred genetic material on the internet. Children are something you do in pairs. Yeah, but you had Dad by your side. If you only knew about all the things we did before conceiving you. - Come, I'll show you something. - Mom! Come! You were our only planned one. We already had Marcela and Dad wanted a boy, so he always carried... - A compass? - Someone told him that your heads should be aimed to the north when you want a boy. So every time we did it, he was watching if our heads were aimed correctly. Well, and he forgot the compass once and... And... When he saw you in the hospital, he totally forgot he wanted a boy. A child should have a dad. Just look how many nice things you did with him. Think it over, will you? I won't, Mom. I'm done with men. When do you want to do it'? When we do the run and I find a place to live. Well. So you're not coming today? Well, I was looking forward to it. Then... wait, Fanny is... Fanny! Fanny, come here! God, leave her be! Shoo! Leave her alone! _ Get away! - Willy! - Willy, leave them alone, come on. - Can't you tie that dog to something? I'm sorry, I had to relieve myself quickly so... I unleashed him and... Is this proper behavior, Willy? When you need to relieve yourself next time, tie your Willy to a tree! Bye! Sorry, some dunce doesn't know how to raise his dog. How about tomorrow? Bara. R- C)- Zar. Ka. Rozarka. Aren't there too many people here? Should we wait until it's dark so no one can see us? Or we could just watch, as a starting point. - God, where is he? - Where's who? - The trainer. - The trainer? - Oh my god. I found him on the internet. I wanted to surprise you. Are you kidding, Mom? It took so much effort to show up, and now I have to listen to a dumb jock tell me how bad I run. Dumb jock apologizes for the delay. - It's you? - It's me. - Jesus... - You know each other? Yeah. His Willy was annoying my Fanny. My dog. A disobedient one. - Well, I'm Vojta. - Vera. - Marcela. - I suggest we skip any formalities. - Bara. - That's what runners usually do. Katerina. And calling us runners is a little premature. Right? Why is he doing that? We'll do five push-ups for each minute we miss when late. It'll make us punctual and when we mess up, we'll strengthen our upper body. - So... - So, let's stretch. Is this your livelihood? No, I work at an international computer firm. Running and training are my hobbies. Other side. Are you single? - Mom, please. - What? I got two unmarried daughters right here. - You're embarrassing, Mom. - Three unmarried daughters. I'm not counting you. That your handyman made three kids and hasn't asked you to marry him is your problem. - Switch feet. - Alright. What are you doing? - Well what is it, Vojta? - I'm single. - Got a girlfriend? - No. But you do like women? Yes. Great, that'll help us train better, right girls? - Please. - I do have one rule. When I'm training someone, I don't get involved with them. Of course. Let's start with a light jog. I need to get a picture of your conditions. Won't be a pretty picture. - Let's get to it. - Right here, right now? Right here and right now. Let's run, girls. Focus all energy in the direction of your movement. The arms work alongside the body. Don't look at your feet, look in front of you. Don't slouch. - So many rules! - Right? Endorphins, the hormones of happiness, are released while running. I'm really not feeling them. The brain is better oxygenated, too. You'd be surprised how many things - you figure out while running. - I'm real curious now. I can't anymore. - What is it? - I'm done. - Katerina! - Katerina! - What is she doing? - No one else has bailed on me this early. At least I'm first in something! I told you, Mom. Shall we run some more? Yeah. And breathe. Mom, you're going to die? No. No Petey, don't worry. I'm not going to die. - I told you running wasn't for you. - Oh please. When's dinner going to be ready? In 11 minutes. Do you have a sore throat, Krystof? - Yeah. - He doesn't. He has a hickie. - Be quiet! - Wait, wait wait. Wait a moment. Show me. - Ouch. Show me. - It's fine, it's nothing. - Take it off so we can see. - Hurry up. That's horrible! That's horrible! - Who did that to you? - No one. I hope it wasn't the girl with the purple hair from next door. - Really? She's good. Congratulations. - She looks like a plum. He wants to nail her. But I hid the hammer so he doesn't go to jail. It's under my bed. - You can return it to its normal spot. - Okay. Because Krystof is not going to be nailing anybody. You can't stop this. Can't forbid it. He's growing up, he's 15. All those sexual desires are going wild in his body. I'm telling you, as soon as he has the chance, he'll do it. I know. But I still see him as a little boy. He hasn't been a little boy for a long time. Do you think it'll fit? - What? - The condom. It might fall off. Please, size-wise? He's more than gifted, takes after me. It'll be better if you show him how to do it. - I'll buy bananas. - Buy cucumbers instead. We haven't had cucumber salad in a long time, so we could... Yeah, yeah. Good idea. - Good thing you have me, huh? - Yeah. Well, goodnight. What do you mean "goodnight"? It's Wednesday! I know. You can do it after all that running, right'? Alright, it won't kill me. You're not going to run on Wednesdays from now on, yeah? We can't risk stuff like this. Connection established. Hi. So, home alone again? - Yeah, how about you? - I'm here with my mom. - My mom's a star. - Really? Yes, when someone dies, they become a star in the sky. When I'm older, I'll build a rocket and fly to her. Hm. Will you take me with you? My dad's up there somewhere too. I could visit him. I'll build a bigger rocket so we can all fit. - My dad and Spot will tag along too. - That's very nice of you, thanks. Want to see a play? - I have some old puppets here. - Yes! And the cow lived her whole life in a barn. And one day, when her farmer closed the gate wrong, the cow used the opportunity and ran out into the world. And suddenly, she was free! And while she was freely walking along, she was singing. Hey- - Who's mooing? - That free cow. Rozarka... You're supposed to be sleeping, not listening to some free cow. Good evening, I'm the cow... I mean Bara! I just wanted to make Rozarka happy. That's nice of you but Rozarka has to go to sleep, she has school tomorrow. Well, maybe she can't fall asleep when you're not home with her. I do think your mooing is very nice but leave this to me. Okay? Goodnight. Why were you so mean to her? She was nice to me. Hurry, to bed. Sleep. Come on. - You're not going to give me a kiss? - You don't deserve one. I see. Honey listen, I want you to learn to go to sleep even when I'm not here. Then be here! I'm investigating an important case right now. Every case is important to you, but what about me? You're the most important to me. Really. You're my darling. - And I like you very much, okay? - I like you too. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Hey. Aren't you supposed to be sleeping? I am. I wanted to apologize for my dad. He's nice. There's just a lot going on sometimes. Goodnight. Night night. What an idea you got. COTTAGE SUMMER 1994 - I'll catch you! I'll catch you! - You won't! - I'll catch you! - You won't catch me! I'll catch you! Gotcha! Well, I've been caught. Smile! Smile at Mommy! Mommy is recording us, see? You promised you'd come today. I made us dinner. Alright then, bye. Hi! Wait! OW. Wait! - You again? - Yeah. - What are you wearing? - A mask for increasing lung capacity. Can you see? Is it okay? No? I live near here so we can go there and you'll wash your eyes out, okay? - It's good. - What? - I'm alright. - You sure? - I'm good. Come on, let's go. Fanny... - Where's your Willy, anyway? - With my ex-girlfriend. We have shared custody. Huh. Come, this way. BON APPETIT It's nice to see you again, I must say. Didn't show up? He made a mistake. - It's delicious. - Thank you. - Thanks. - Thanks for your hospitality. - Well, I got to run! - Of course. Wait! He left it here for special occasions, so... - I don't drink hard liquor. - Really? He keeps spraying me with her perfume like I'm a stolen car. Well, and mine ran away with another guy. That's not possible, is it? For a girl to run away from you. She's the 400-meter dash national champion. Well, then it is possible. We have to watch our fluid intake. Cheers. He only keeps me around for fun. I bought an engagement ring for her. - Ouch! - Sorry. You should find someone who's not taken. And you should find someone slower who won't run away. - Mom'? - I came to show you something. - I have to get ready for work. - You reek of alcohol. - Please no comments. - Jesus. Look, look what I found. - Watch! - I'll catch you, I'll catch you! - That's me and Dad? - You chased him good. And what? Don't say that you weren't made for running. I was tiny, that can't count. It does count. Your entire life counts. I can't run 10,5 kilometers, I just can't! Yes, you can. You own a talking wardrobe? Didn't talk until today. It's all about the mindset. So you're saying I can't run because I'm stupid? No, it's about switching mindsets and believing you can do it. Yes, exactly. You should finally switch those mindsets. - Good morning! - Vojta! What are you doing here? In the wardrobe? I'd love to know as well. - How did I get here? - Oh dear. - Mom'? - Yeah? - Can you send me that video with Dad? - Of course. Once we've trained enough, we'll run up these hills there. These ones? - Go to your room, go play, alright? - Go, go. Go study beavers. - Aw jeez. - Pick one. Now, tear the wrapper carefully as to not damage the condom. Okay, good. Give it to me. Softly blow through it. And you can put it on. - Do you need help? - Mind your own business. Can I go now? You'll wait until I put it on, no? We're doing this together. - Probably had a better cucumber. - Probably. Now look. It's never this big in reality anyway! Don't go anywhere yet, Krystof. You have to try it blind... - Here, I got it! - Great! It's so you can do it in total darkness, too. - Me too? - You too, you're serving as an example. He's not going to be able to see with that over his eyes. - Stop complaining! - Put that over your eyes. It's a wonder we've only got three kids. It's done! I got it! Look! Damn it. - Hi. - Hey. -You miss the wardrobe? Not really, but Willyjust had to see Fanny. Got a gift for her. A running harness. He also dug up a very nice belt with a leash. Is Willy implying that I should start running with Fanny? I think so. - Starting now, ideally. - That's too bad, cause my trainer told me to take a break from training today. Isn't your trainer kind of a dumb jock? - He is! You know him? - Well enough. I think he'd allow a walk with the occasional light jog. I'll ask Fanny, then. Fanny! Fanny, that's enough! Jesus Christ! Oh crap! - What is it? - My man is over there with his wife. - The one whose dinner I ate? - Yes. What... what are you doing? Smile at me. - Why did you do that? - I wanted to help you. - With what? - Getting rid of him. But I don't know if I want to get rid of him. So you're fine with being sprayed with wife's perfume like you're a stolen car? It's him. What am I going to tell him? That you found a boyfriend. Pick it up, come on. _ WHO was tflaYtfl/GS? gUy h _ ugglng you? - It's my new boyfriend. - What? I'm thinking of divorce because of you and you find a new boyfriend? You've been telling me that for two years. I want someone who'll take me to the theatre or for a walk, I don't want to share! You know what? Be with him! But don't come to work tomorrow, you're fired! And you'll move out of my flat! - You did it. - Yeah. And now I don't have a man, a job, and I'm homeless. Great. DO YOU KNOW HOW TO MAKE STRAWBERRY DUMPLINGS? Strawberry dumplings are Dad's favorite food. My dad liked them too. I like blueberry ones better, though. You have to connect it here like so... - Press it together properly... - So that there aren't any holes! Exactly, close every gap and roll it around like this. It's lopsided. That's okay. Doesn't make a difference to the tummy. - Why do you not have children? - I haven't met the right guy yet. - Well, guys are difficult. - They sure are. One boy said he'll give me a puppy if I date him. Wow, sounds serious. It is, cause I want the puppy but not the boy. Daddy wouldn't let me keep the dog anyway. Why? He thinks I wouldn't be able to take care of him by myself. When I'm older, he said. Daddy! - Hi! Bara and I made you strawberry dumplings. I told you not to let strangers home, didn't I? Bara isn't a stranger. - Hello. - Hello. Rozarka asked me to help her make strawberry dumplings. Of course. That's very nice of you. You're about the fifth girl to make dumplings here, Rozarka here is always trying to set me up with someone, isn't that right? I'm sorry, I just came to help out. - You're very nice, thank you. - Yeah. I... - My purse. - Oh. - Here it is! - Oh, thanks! Thanks, Rozarka. - Bye for now! - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Why do you do this? - Because you need a woman! Listen... You're more than enough, okay? But I'll get married one day and you'll be left all alone! - What are you going to do? - Marry! It's a little early for that. Come on. You'll show me what you made. Sorry. Ex-girlfriend? - You still love her, don't you? - Where'd you get that idea? Don't have to be a detective to know that. It's nice here, though. - Hi! - Hello. - You took Dad with you? - Oh no, he's home, but... - Look! - What? - Yeah! I got them made for the race. - Very nice! Bara. - Marcela! - Here's Katerina's. And mine. You're going to be living together from now on? It's just friends helping each other, please don't make a big deal out of it. That's enough. Hi, Rozarka. Daddy is very sick, I don't know what to do. I'll be there in a second. If it's really bad, call 155, an ambulance. Okay? I'm sorry, I got to run. See you. Bara, what is it? Bara! Excuse me! It looks like it's a ruptured appendix, you'll have to come with us. What about your daughter? Can anyone take care of her? No. Me! I'll take care of her! - Are you sure? - Yeah! Don't cry... Daddy will be back home soon. I don't want him to become a star. He won't. Mommy was taken away by an ambulance too and she became a star. Don't worry, it'll be okay. They took my appendix out too, and I'm not a star. What do you say? I'm right here! So I can name the ship whatever I want? - Of course. It's going to be yours. - I'm going to name it after Mom. - So Marcela? - No, Mommy. That's very nice, Petey. It's cute. What do you think about my racing shirt, huh? - Also nice, don't you think? - Yeah, it's good. Mom, why's your surname Kovarova and not like ours? Well, that's because... Your daddy hasn't asked for my hand in marriage yet. - Daddy, you don't want Mommy's hand? - I do, I want both. But the important part is two people liking each other, a wedding isn't necessary. - Hi! Where were you? - Out. And did you... Are you going to ask me every day whether I did it or not? - Well? - No! Krystof wants to break up with that girl. Really? - He told some guy over the phone. - I see. Why? She doesn't want to give it up, but I don't know what "it" is. I wouldn't want to date a stingy girl either. Same here, boy. What are you doing? If you keep her here forever, you'll never get over it. Wait... No, you didn't wait either when you embraced me in that park. Thank you. - That's you? - Uh-huh. - You were pretty. - I'm not pretty anymore? You are. Less pretty, though. - Do you miss him? - Of course I do. Look. He knit these socks so I wouldn't be cold. They're nice! - Ice cream! - Yum! - Thanks. - Here you go. I wonder how he's going to look without that appendix. As good as he did with it. Do you like my dad? His nose is a little big, but it has to be like that. - Why? - To sniff out all the crime. I see. I think he's the handsomest and best guy in the world. If you say so, it must be true. He'd be even better if he let me get a dog. - Goodnight. - Night. Give me a kiss. - Night. - Goodnight. ...3, 2, 1. Now you try! Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop. Yeah! Daddy! Hey! Hello my dear, my darling, I missed you so much. Hi. - Hello. - Hello. - This is for you. - Wow, thank you. No, it's me who should be thanking you. - You really don't have to thank me. - I really do. - You helped me a lot. - Still acting all formal? Okay, well... - I'm Josef. - I'm Bara. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you as well. - HEY- - HEY- - How'd the interview go? - Horror. A friend told me she's looking for someone to train guide dogs. - Want to try? - Good idea. Never occurred to me. Oh, here. I brought something for you. Wait. Like so. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Well. New times ahead, huh? I was offered a position at our Denmark branch at work today. - Are you going to accept it? - No. After all, I have shared custody of Willy here. And I've got you girls to train. That's true. - Will you marry me'? - Yes! That's so nice. - Will you sign this? - Yeah, give it here. You were running naked around the school, Jakub? - I lost a bet. - What was it? Who can pee farther. - You couldn't try harder? - I really tried! You should have drunk more water! Karel! That's your only response? You make bets only when you're sure you'll win! Be smart! For example... If Mom tries betting that she's a better runner than me, I'm in. Cause I know I'll always be faster than her, however much she trains. - Are you sure? - I thought that was obvious. Let's make a bet then. If I beat you, you'll ask me to marry you. Sure. Confirm it. - A promise made is a promise kept. - And it will be kept! Go do your math. Look. We'll race on the first section of the relay. Karel will sign up with the guys from football tennis. We should step on it if you want to get married! - Mom, wait! - Girls! You can't reach the finish line You take breaks all the time Sometimes you like to take shortcuts... - Good? - Uh-huh. You come back As soon as you start When you can't move Try breathing in It's an odd feeling Being alone until the night Life keeps flowing through your veins So let it be there Before you lose your breath forever When you're out of strength Push harder Scream at the top of your lungs The word "can't" doesn't exist The word "can't" doesn't exist When you're out strength Push harder Scream at the top of your lungs You can do it, you'll get through it You can do it You cancel your plans quickly Got an excuse why you can't do them There's problems with your walking One step forward But two steps back... One, two, three, four, five... Six! It's an odd feeling Being alone until the night Life keeps flowing through your veins So let it be there Before you lose your breath forever When you're out of strength Push harder Scream at the top of your lungs The word "can't" doesn't exist The word "can't" doesn't exist When you're out strength Push harder Scream at the top of your lungs You can do it, you'll get through it You can do it There's that mood again You want to fall asleep To just not be and do nothing But a lure keeps hanging Everything you love Just get up and say When you're out of strength Push harder Scream at the top of your lungs The word "can't" doesn't exist The word "can't" doesn't exist When you're out strength Push harder Scream at the top of your lungs You can do it, you'll get through it You can do it When you're out of strength Push harder Scream at the top of your lungs The word "can't" doesn't exist The word "can't" doesn't exist When you're out strength Push harder Scream at the top of your lungs The word "can't" doesn't exist The word "can't" doesn't exist When you're out strength Push harder Scream at the top of your lungs You can do it, you'll get through it You can do it _ HGY. - Where are you going? - I'm going for a walk. I might run a little. I thought you could take me without training. - Or are you getting scared? - I just want to see where I'm at. Thank you for saving me, handsome young man. You're very welcome, beautiful princess. And now... Now what? Now, they lived happily ever after. Not yet. - Yes, I've run out of ideas. - They still have to kiss. Okay, well... Then... a kiss. A smooch. You should also kiss already. You know what, miss advisor? It's high time for bed. Rozarka has strange ideas sometimes. Well... How come you aren't asleep already? Well? How's your stamina? My stamina? It's good. If I'm carrying my dad on my back, you should carry yours. What? There's a pretty substantial weight difference. - My dad weighs 100 kilos. - He should lose weight, then. He'd have to follow a pretty dramatic diet to get down to three kilos. I'm all for a fair fight. We'll both carry the same weight. Alright, you'll have three kilos of potatoes in your backpack. Sure, I don't mind. Goodnight. It's Wednesday today. I know. Or are you not up for it after running? Of course I'm up for it. Karel? Karel! You feel asleep! We'll finish next Wednesday. Good morning! What? - Oh god. - Rozarka! Good morning, hey! - Thanks. - You're welcome. Bara was too exhausted yesterday to walk home, so... She had to sleep over. So Sara's going to live with us now? If she wants to, then... Well, have you brushed your teeth yet? Yes. Good, then... Go look out the window, see if people are out and about. But that's boring. - Go watch TV then. - Okay. ROMEO AND JULIET Crosswalk. Crosswalk! Good dog. That's a good dog. Hi! - Hey. - Guess what happened? I out in the city training a dog, and a guy went to help me cross the road, he thought I was actually blind. He managed to invite me out to the theatre before we crossed the street. - And are you going to go? - Of course! He's very likable. You know what his name is? Jindrich. Same name as my dad. I think that's a sign that he's the right one. It's not a sign, it's a coincidence. I think it is a sign. But this happened because of you, since you got me that job! - No... - Thank you so much! No problem. - H“! I'm home. - Hey. What's that dog doing here? - Someone tied him to a dumpster. Can I keep him? I'll call him Spot! We had an agreement concerning dogs. When you're older. - Look how happy he made her. - Bara, please. I already booked an appointment with the vet. If you meddle with my raising methods like this, this won't work out. - Come eat. - I'm not hungry. Come on. You think that everything has to be the way you want it to be. It doesn't. He's really nice but I don't want to hurry things. He likes running too, so I thought he could tag along with us sometime. I accepted that position at our Denmark branch. What? I'm not going to be here for your race. You'll manage without me. You'd have to run without me anyway. - Well, what about Willy? - He'll come with me. Renata agreed to it. She's pregnant, so she'll have different concerns entirely. Nothing's keeping me here. Icanletyou take over the apartment lease, if you're not planning to move in with Jindrich. No, not quite yet. So, well... when are you leaving? Come on! Just a bit more! A little more! Thank you! - Good luck. - Same to you. Willy, come on. Could you please sneeze quieter? I'm trying to paint you onto the ship. - Let's French kiss. - What? You said you were all for a fair fight. It'd be fair if you took on half of my germs for the race. Have you gone crazy? Aren't you overdoing the "fair" part? Not at all. Come, I'm serious. - No... - Yes, it's fair play. - It's disgusting... - Oh, please. Come on. - That's enough. - No it's not. You won't catch anything like this. Come here. - What are you doing? - Mom's giving me her germs. - Mommy, can you give me some too? - No, honey. Be glad you're healthy. - Go play in your room. - No, stay here. Oh, did you know that Krystof's girl isn't stingy anymore? Really? - That's good, right? - It sure is. Go to your room so you don't catch anything, okay? Well, our first has done it. Two left. That totally took the joy out of my germ giving. - Finally came to your senses. - Oh no. You can't be healthier than me. No, I already feel a sore throat coming on. No, I have to be sure. Come here. Tomorrow's the big day. Oh... oh! Help! - Did you see what he looked like? - Just from behind. Well... Was he wearing anything? I don't... he had a hooded sweatshirt. Alright. I'll do everything I can, okay? Well? There's almost no chance they'll find him. You were right, it was nonsense. If we had buried Dad right away this never would have happened. No one could expect this, Morn. All that running was pointless. - No... - No, it wasn't. Dad won't mind that we don't have him on our backs. Because we all have him right... here. Mom... I welcome all lovers of running, marathoners especially! A beautiful circuit awaits you... Thank you. ...you have to complete it four times to conquer the length of a marathon! Got it! - We'd beat them even if we got lost. - Here! That's you. - Thanks. You too. Remember, Dad wanted to run this, so no walking. It wouldn't count. Here's pins... GO MOM! On your stomach, right here! - Stop playing the seamstress, Karel! - Mind your own business, darling. Only a few seconds left until the starting shot! - Want a tissue? - Thanks, I got my own. - Have a good run. - You too. Ready... Go! Go! Go! Marcela! Marcela! - Cheers, Marcy! - Marcy doesn't want any! - Drink! - No! I got you! You don't! - Hi Bara. - Hi Rozarka, what are you doing here? - I came to cheer you on. - That's very nice of you. Daddy doesn't know. He's at work again. I don't want to live with him anymore, can I move in with you and Spot? We can't do that, your dad would be very sad. Rozarka, I have to run. Wait over there with my mom, okay? I'll be here in a bit. Do it! Hurry! Go! Hurry! Go! Bard. Gm! You were good! Really. Don't be sad, Mommy. I'll be your husband. You're a wonderful boy, you know that? - Come here, honey. - Don't worry about it. Fuck! Here, you have to watch your fluid intake. - What is it? - Wait! - Marcela? The engagement ring was in there! Hit her back! Jesus. Marcela! Here it is! Look, that's it! - That's it, look! - You okay? - Will you marry me'? - Jesus Christ! - But I lost! - It was obvious, what did you expect? You're first to me. As a woman I mean, you always were. Will you marry me, Marcela? - Marcela? - Well? - Kids, say something to Mom! - Yes, mom! - Yes! - Yeah, that's great! I knew it. Well, thanks! Okay, boys! - There's going to be a wedding! - Are you glad, boys'? - How's it looking? - Good! Well, Marcela lost to Karel but she's engaged anyway! Oh, and you were right. It was just a coincidence. Jindrich turned out to be taken. - Bara! A little further! - Yes! - I have to run now, wish me luck! - I will. - Bye. Come on Bara! Go! Go, go! But I can visit you and Spot, right? If I don't move too far away. - You want to move? - Yes... Go, mom! Go! - Congratulations! - Thank you. How was it? I think my brain was oxygenated better, I remembered why you went to sleep in the closet that time. Why? Well... We wanted to kiss each other because we were drunk, but you said we shouldn't. That we should wait until we're sober. You went into that closet so we wouldn't be tempted. We're sober now. Yeah. In different places, though. We saw a lot of amazing performances. We congratulate everyone who finished. Did she get lost or something? - There she is! - Mom! Come on! Hurry! Come here! We're here! Go, go, go! Fight! Great! You're great! You did it! Hello. Congratulations on the race. I didn't manage to get him in time, sadly. Better late than never, though. Thank you! - Come. - Thank you, children. - How'd you do it? - He sniffed the criminal out. Aren't you supposed to be at home right now? I wanted to apologize for the way I reacted that time. I said it in the wrong way. Would you want to come over for dinner tonight? Probably not. That's very sad, because I'm going to be making blueberry dumplings. Got the recipe and everything. Rozarka said you liked blueberry ones. I do. I also like to meddle in raising methods, though. Right. So are you coming? - Only if Spot can come. - Yes! I bought dog food so he doesn't get sick off my dumplings. - So you knew I'd agree! - No, I didn't. But I wanted you to. - How's Vojta? - I don't know. He hasn't been in touch since the race. Hey! Where'd you find it? Behind the cottage. Trying Dad's northern method? Well, you know. It's two girls and one guy now. We should balance it out. Good going. - You really don't play football tennis? - I don't. - What are we going to do? - Hey, hang up and help with the chairs! - Not even a little? - No. - I'll call you later. - What are you babbling on about? - Her time of the month's late! - What did you do, darn it! - I didn't do anything. - He says her time of the month's late! - Mommy's time of the month. - What? She told Grandma and the aunties, but I don't know what it means. - Congratulations! - Thanks. - "What did you do", huh? - Watch your mouth. - Well that's great! - So it's certain? - It's certain, Mom. - So you were running for two, really. - And that's why I didn't win! - Of course. Marcela! There's going to be more of us'? Well, we'll have to hurry the wedding up. So I fit in the dress. I feel like it's a girl this time. That's great, then. There's going to be more of us, still. You mean twins? Oh, him. Okay. What are you doing here? I came running for my kiss. You couldn't be more careful? Excuse me'? Petey! What are you doing, Petey? I'm watering Grandpa's tree so it grows good. He's a good boy. What are you laughing about, Mom? I just remembered that Dad had one more big wish. - What? - What was it? He wanted to... - What? - What gave him the idea? - Great! - He can't be serious. He was kidding. - If the whole family helps, we can do it! - The kids, too? - Of course. - Including me'? - Yes Karel, you too. What are the boys at football tennis going to do? They'll be odd. - Mom, I can't. I'm pregnant! - You can do this while pregnant. You've gone crazy, Mother. - Can they lock us up for it? - In an asylum, maybe! - I don't think anyone's done that yet! - Then we'll be first. He must have been kidding. He was kidding, right? No, you're kidding. Oh, you're not. Directed and written by Produced by Director of Photography Edited by Line Producer Sound Art Director Costume Designer Make-up Artist First Assistant Director
