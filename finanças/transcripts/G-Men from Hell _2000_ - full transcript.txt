[ Up-tempo jazz music playing ] Nobody understands me, not a soul. You keep saying that. Mm. How long have you been feeling this way? Oh, you know how long. Ja. Ja. An eternity. Perhaps we should move on. Tell me about your mother. You see, I'm really not such a bad guy. It's just -- it's just I've -- well, it's just i-i-I've got this job to do. Everyone has some job, some task, some specialty. But I keep feeling everybody hates me, like -- like -- like it's all my fault. But I am not the one to blame. Come, now. Is it reasonable to believe that people you don't know would hate you? It's the things I do, I guess. I mean, let's -- let's face it. I've got to do some unpopular things in my... line of work. How would you categorize your line of work? I have one of the most... [ Whispering ] I don't know, man I'm not so sure about this. What's the matter, mattress? Are you scared? I'm not scared. I'm not scared of nothing. You're not telling me you're starting to like this place? I want to get out of here as much as the next sap, okay? I just don't want to get caught, okay? If we get caught, we're gonna be in a world of snot Where do you think we are now? This is it. It doesn't get any worse than this This is the place the nuns were talking about. My mind is the best mind in all the universe, except for God, of course. He has the best mind. I have the second best. We were living up there. We lived up there in the heavens. God will see he screwed up sending us down here, and then we'll be on easy street, kid. We didn't do one stinking bad deed to get down here. Right? Right, deano? It's a raw, us getting sent down here. All we got to do is get back on an earthly plane and do a couple of good deeds. It's gonna be all right, kid. You show me how to do one good deed, I'll do a thousand good deeds. First we got to get out of here. Well, our time is up. We will continue next week. Wait. I'm finished? Uh, sorry. You know the rules. Ah. I had so much more to say. [ Whispering ] Watch it. Uh, would you mind taking care of your past-due bill? You're all the same. Whoa. Look out. [ Door creaks ] All right, listen up. I've been staking out this creep the past couple of weeks. Every time after therapy, he makes his way back to earth to rack up a few more souls. Now, this is what we're gonna when he makes his move this time, we follow him, okay? You ready? Well -- let's go. [ Door creaks ] Now what's he doing? Shh. Is that a crystal? Yeah.Thecrystal. [ Door creaks ] Keep a lookout. [ Door creaks ] Another crystal. Nice. Come on. Let's do it. All right. Hello, boys! Shoot. How's it going, Mikey? Oh, weenie man, what the hell are you doing here? Hell is where we're at, Mickey. I told you, never call me "Mickey," weenie! Please. I prefer "winiford." [ Grunts ] Ohh! Hey, hey, cool it, kid. Stinkin' devil zombie. Hey, after all, I've got as much right to be here as both of youse. You got more, you ass-lickin' -- hey! I told you to cool it, kid. Yeah. Now, that temper of yours is gonna get the best of you. Ugh! Ohh. [ Groans ] Come on. Let's go. Okay, but where? There. Deano. Come on, mattress. I'm not jumping into that! [ Breathing heavily ] We've got nothing to lose. [ Girls giggling ] Maybe, uh -- maybe hell isn't so bad, you know? I mean, uh, there -- there are perks. Look, you stay if you want. I'm going. Later, kid. [ Evil laughter ] Come on, mattress. I don't know, man. Come on. It's not so bad. Come on! [ Laughter continues ] [ Grunts ] Aah! Aah! Aah! Grab the crystal! Aaaaaah! Ohhhhhh! Aaaaaah! Ohhhhhh! Aaaaaah! Ohhhhhh! Aah! Whoa! [ Both grunt ] [ Both gasping, coughing ] [ Both laugh ] I think we made it! [ Exhales heavily, coughs ] Somebody's coming. [ Sultry jazz music plays ] Whoa, baby, I think we just skipped earth and went straight to heaven. What the hell are you doing in my tub? We better get out of here. Uh, uh, we were inspecting the, uh -- the -- the shower rings, ma'am. Nice, uh -- nice rings. Get out now, or I'll call the cops! Well, uh, there's no need for that, ma'am. We're FBI. I'm agent crept, and this is my partner, Mike mattress. Right. And I'm j. Edgar hoover. I doubt Mr. hoover could fill a towel like that. All right, cut it out, mattress. We got work to do. Pardon us, ma'am. Catch you later. [ Chuckles ] [ Exhales sharply, scoffs ] What's the rush, deano? It's been awhile since I -- put it in your pants, mattress. I think she likes me. Good deeds, Mike. Remember? Good deeds. We have plenty of time for broads later, after we're in solid with the big guy. [ Mid-tempo jazz music plays ] [ Chuckles ] Our old beat. So, what do we do now? First thing we do -- set up a p.I. Business. That way, we can help people. How we gonna afford this shindig? Don't worry about it, kid. I got that covered. Huh? We're gonna hit up buster the shark. Buster Lloyd? Why buster? Because he bought us off when we was g-men, and that's his scene. [ Scoffs ] No kidding. I don't have my gun. Hey. I don't even have my badge. Don't worry about it. We'll persuade him. [ Chuckling ] And I'm just the man to do it. Yeah, a little arm-twist -- our first good deed. Evil must perish. Good. [ Knock on door ] [ Chuckles ] Yeah? What? [ Grunts ] Unh! Ohh! [ Exhales sharply ] [ Groaning ] Hmm. Aah! [ Gasping ] Crept! Mattress! But... you were knocked off! The papers said -- "dirty feds bit the big one." [ Chuckles ] Misprint, pal. Do we look dead to you, huh? No. Listen up, rat. We come here looking for some payback, see? Huh? Hey, buster... Ow! It wasn't you that set us up, was it? No, Mike. Ow! Honest. No. Oh, yeah? Well, then you won't mind spotting us a couple of bucks, will you? Ow. [ Breathing heavily ] Uh, n-no, no problem. But, uh, uh, uh -- but could you come back tomorrow? I'm, uh -- I'm a little short right now. Tomorrow is an eternity, pal. A high mogul like you's got to have a stash. Yeah, uh, of course I got a stash, you know? You fellas just name how much money you need, and, well, the old bank of buster will float you along. In fact, you don't even have to pay the vig. Don't worry about it, buster. We're not greedy. I'm sure whatever you got in the safe will be fine. And don't worry. We plan on paying you back. Buster, uh, you wouldn't happen to know who, uh, might have set us up, would you? Or may be who rigged that booby trap? You guys didn't know what happened? Oh, it was terrible. It was an accident. The two of you fellas was walking across the street, in the middle of the crosswalk, and then out of nowhere -- bam! Except we weren't hit by cars, you freak head! Those guys were waiting for us, armed till doomsday! You know, buster, that car bomb -- it was no accident. What do you think? I think, uh, till you guys get back on the government expense account, uh, well, we'll have to wait until my memory gets a little better. Well, but until then -- ugh! [ Blows ] Nice try, jerk. If that ain't a good deed, I don't know what is. Nice shootin'. Where'd you get the piece? You kidding me? He's got a gun in every nook and cranny in this place. How much we got? Plenty. Too bad, buster. We probably would have just messed you around a little bit. Say "so long" to Satan. [ Chuckles ] I'm sure you'll be smelling his puss-bucket breath. [ Both laugh ] [ Sighs ] Puss-bucket. [ Both laugh ] I don't get it. I just don't get it. I mean, those two guys -- they're not that bright. And they're not that good-looking. So, what makes them so, uh, special? They stole your crystal! I saw them do it! Right after you left, they -- [ groaning ] Will you shut up?! I'm trying to talk here! I can't hear myself think! Excuse me. Now, I had nothing to do with it, and I pleaded with them. I begged them. I said, "don't take the crystal. Don't take the crystal." But they took the crystal. I'm sure that's absolutely true. I mean, why would you lie, considering the consequences? [ Laughs evilly ] All right, my little retriever, go, bring my children back home. See, winiford, we're like family down here. We don't want anyone flying from the Coop. No. [ Laughs evilly ] [ Sighs ] Tsk, tsk, tsk. [ Chuckling ] Hey. Buster's got some fine threads. Care for a new tie, Mr. crept? Eh. You couldn't never trust that weasel. But he always kept stock of the finer things. Oh, I love plaid. Go on. Help yourself. That creepy ain't gonna be needing more than one pair of trousers from now on. [ Chuckles ] Come to think of it, his wheels ain't gonna do him any good, either, huh? [ Laughs ] These clothes -- they don't fit right. Pretty good for a donation, huh? You look snazzy. [ Chuckles ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Horn honks ] [ Engine turns over ] [ Tires screech ] So, where to now, deano? I found this cool office, a real fixer/upper. You're gonna love it. Oh. I can hardly wait. [ Horn honks ] [ Tires screech ] [ Engine shuts off ] [ Car doors close ] Hey. You Lester? That's right. We're crept and mattress. We come about the office. You want the office? Sign the lease. Is it a nice place? Define "nice." Would I want to do your mom in it? You got a sharp mouth, young man. I'd watch it if I was youse. Relax, pal. Kid's got a warped sense of humor. I'll sign the lease. Here you go. [ Horn honks ] Rent's due on the first. You're late once, I'll give a 3-day notice. All right, no problem. Yeah, that's what everybody says. You're late twice, and I make a visit. [ Bell rings ] And I'll get both of your cheeks! Then I'll put it in a meat grinder! And I'll grind it up into little, bitty meatballs! Do you understand?! Pleasure doing business with you, pal. Hey, you guys, wait a minute. Didn't the paper say youse guys got killed or something? Don't believe everything you read in the papers, pal. Here you go, crabby. I love this place. It's got style, real style. [ Bell rings ] I think your brain is damaged. Solid architecture. They don't make them like this anymore. Where's our office? Right up here, fourth floor. [ Breathing heavily ] [ Groans ] What do you think, huh? Old-school, right? [ Sniffs ] What's that smell? [ Panting ] Here we go, kid -- the start of our new life. [ Door opens ] Crept, this stinks. Come on. Relax, kid. Huh? Fresh coat of paint, some new furniture, a looker of a secretary -- this'll be a classy business. Yeah, right. Hey, will, glad you made it. Luke. There's no body, and there's not much to work with yet. Who's the haircut? [ Flashbulb pops ] Your new partner. Come again? Alex Dalton. The commissioner's nephew. That's right. Wonderful. Thanks for the warning. Hey, no problem. Just go easy on him. Yeah, right. Lieutenant Langdon, I'm really glad to have you as part of the team. Well, it's an honor to be here. Well, you know, it's, uh -- it's kind of common knowledge that you are a, uh -- a gay -- that is to say, homosexual man. And I just want to say up front that I have absolutely no problem. [ Growls ] I am a sadistic leather-master homosexual, and I will tease your sensibilities. Stand down. I don't have any problem with pussies, as long as they stay out of my face. What do you got? Uh, well, the -- the, uh, landlady heard some shots. Um, the room is registered to one buster Lloyd. He's a small-time hood. An informant, a dealer. I know him well. What else? Uh, okay. There was no forced entry. The safe was not jimmied, but it was, however, cleaned out, which means that either buster has skipped town or he's been popped. He's been popped. Yeah. Do you know what the word "pop" means? Move him. Let's go. Come on. What else do you got? Um, well, uh, you know, uh... Whose blood? I'm sorry? Whose brains made this pattern on the wall? Oh, uh, that is... We don't -- we don't have that yet. [ Chuckles ] Are we supposing they're buster's brains? For Christ's sake, what have you been doing all morning? Well, w-we were trying to gather evidence properly. Now, w-wait a second. We found, uh, two sets of prints, one right down there on the broken vase, and then there was another one on the safe. Prints. Whose? What are you expecting -- a handwritten signature? W-we also found a gun on the floor, a .45. It had been recently fired. A gun. That's good. What else? Oh, uh, one last thi-- oh, his clothes and his car were both gone, which leads us to believe that that's probably somebody else's brains -- blood. Sorry. Jesus, palmina. Get down! I want you to find that body. Find the murder weapon, if you ladies have time for that. And by the size of this bullet hole, we're looking for a .38 police special. It's way too small for a .45. You! Come on! Get moving! Move it! This is a nice house. [ Snoring ] They should have a lot of money. And it'll be all ours. [ Birds chirping ] What is it now? Listen, I am telling you, they are back! They have killed buster. Now they may be coming for you or me. Mmm. I've always preferred the bouquet of blue lady to Mr. Lincoln. It's so much more subtle. [ Chuckles ] They have come back from the dead! Then it's a double-cross. All right, all right, I will take care of it. Anyway, buster deserved what he got. Oh. Well, then maybe buster's body could be donated to science. Waste not, want not. I really don't care what you do anymore. What? Dr. boiffard, I think the time has come for you and I to go our separate ways. But if I were you -- but you're not me, are you? Look, you've done a wonderful job. You'll get a fair severance, and all debts will be extinguished. However, as you see, my interests have shifted from the sciences [Sniffs] to the arts. I wish you the very best in your research, doctor. But mattress and crept -- they may come back. That's a good one. Like Jesus Christ, huh? Oh, no, no. Or, rather, like Lazarus. Goodbye, doctor. Hi. Hmph! Hmm. Dr. boiffard left without saying hello. That was very rude. You didn't upset him, did you, grey? He is a man with an overactive imagination. Not to worry, my darling. Not -- Gloria, how many times have I told you to wear more clothing when you're ambling about. The help will lose respect. Mmm. Heya, doc. What happened? Ah, the idiot fired me. What? He can't do that. What about the trust money? I don't care. I warned him. Whatever happens now is his own fault. We've got our own work to do. Now, wake him up. I am too weak to drive. Hey, dingus, get up. [ Groans, snorts ] Come on. Take Dr. boiffard to the lab. [ Engine turns over ] [ Chuckles ] Hey, crept, that you? Yeah. Oh, what's happening, Ace? You're not gonna like this very much. What? I just ran into an old acquaintance of ours. [ Laughs ] How you doing, Ricky?! Uh, what the hell is he doing here? Hell is why I'm here, Mickey. I told you not to call me that. [ Gunshot ] Ow! Stinkin' zombies. They don't even have a brain to blow out. Aw. Why you have to go and do that for? [ Spits ] [ Brain squishes ] It's gonna leave a scar. You two don't have to be angry with me. I'm just doing what I'm told. What's that? To bring you two back and the crystal to where you belong. Hey, no way. We ain't going back there under any circumstances. Relay that message, weenie. You can tell that sulfurous, fart-smellin', over-tan butt-licker we're too good to spend eternity down there! You got that, bub? [ Sighs ] Yeah. You fellas don't belong here. You're just like me, except you're too afraid to admit it. [ Chuckles ] Admitting it has nothing to do with it. Did you know that you could shoot yourself in the foot and you wouldn't even feel it? [ Chuckles ] [ Scoffs ] I'm not gonna fall for that. You know I'm right. Oh, you don't think I'm man enough, huh? Don't let him get inside your head, kid. It's okay, deano. I'm gonna show this miserable zombie what a real g-man is made out of. Don't be a sap. No blood. You two were sent to hell because that's where you belong! If we knew there was a hell, we would have done a lot of good deeds. But I can say with a clear conscience we never did a bad deed, right, deano? Oh, yeah. Then how come you were taking payoffs from crooks like buster so that he can go on with business as usual, huh?! So? Everybody did that. See, that's the thing. You don't know the first thing about law enforcement. So, tell your damn boss to get thee hence and get the hell out of here! Well, I'll pass the word on. Listen to me, you punk. We ain't like you and the rest of the scum down there, all right? We're better than that. All right! All right! But I just hope you guys know what you're doing. [ Laughs evilly ] You do, deano, right? I mean, we did have it better than some of those poor saps down there. Don't sweat it, mattress. We ain't going back. [ Bell rings ] All right, here you go, fellas, right this way. Come on, over here against the wall. There you go. [ Sighs ] There you go. Be careful. See? Hey! Huh? It's not so bad. You know what we got to do? We got to change our attitude, you know, open up our minds. What we need right now is a secretary. I'm gonna go call one of them temp agencies. What I need right now is a glass of water. There you go, fellas. Buy yourselves an ice-cream cone, all right? Thanks. [ Exhaling heavily ] It's not polite to stare. Well, in my case, do you mind making an exception? Because it's been a long time since I've seen a moving man with such big brown eyes. [ Chuckles ] My eyes are Hazel, but nice try. So they are. Mm-hmm. [ Chuckles ] So, how long you been at this racket? Well, if you're gonna make it your business [Chuckles] since 10:30 this morning. Yeah? You liking it? Well -- [ Groaning ] -- I don't think my back's liking it very much. I imagine not. What do you say about a career change? My partner and I are looking to hire a, uh, individual with your qualifications. [ Keys clack ] Can you type? [ Exhales sharply ] 95 words a minute. You're hired. [ Squeals ] Can I wear skirts? [ Giggles ] Only if you get a note from your doctor. [ Clears throat ] Oh, I'm marete, by the way, uh, marete Morrissey. [ Giggles ] My résumé -- I have it somewhere, but, well, it's not on me [Giggles] as you can see. [ Giggles ] Mike. Mattress. Hi. Crept. Dean crept. Mm. Hi. Hi. Hey, wait a minute. You ain't accountants, are you? Not by a long chalk. Good. [ Giggles ] [ Knock on door ] Well, kid, you still want the job, you're on the payroll as of right now. [ Exhales sharply ] [ Squeals ] Great. I'll get that. [ Exhales sharply ] [ Exhales sharply ] Oh, I'm really sorry, but the job's already been filled. Hi. I hope this is the right place. You're hired, too. Excuse me? [ Door closes ] So, how fast do you type? Pardon me? You're crept and mattress, I take it? "The private dicks who always get the job done"? Maybe. What's it to you, sister? If you are, I'd like to hire you. Well, office hours don't start for another 15 minutes, but maybe you'd like to hire me until then. Oh, brother. Ma'am, please, why don't you have a seat? Okay. You don't recognize me, do you? Shower rings. Pardon? You're the feds in my bath, checking out my shower rings. Oh, right. Yeah. [ Chuckles ] Right. I didn't recognize you with your, uh, clothes on. [ Drawer closes ] Ma'am, is there something we can do for you? Hey. What can we do to make your day, sister? I need your help. I think my husband's trying to kill me! She needs us. Lady, you came to the right place. You getting this, marete? Uh-huh. Let me see if I got this straight. Now, your daddy died, and he left you a lot of money. And you met this swell guy. And you married this swell guy. Now this swell guy ain't so swell so no more. That's about it. And then I saw the life-insurance policy he took out on me without my knowledge. Rotten bastard! I'm afraid to go back to the estate, not while he's there. All right, I'll tell you what you do. You go wait at your apartment downtown till we straighten things out with your husband. Yeah, hide out in that place with the, uh, nifty tub. Marete, would you care to escort miss lake back to her car? Of course. Thank you, boys. Thank you very much. Our pleasure, sister. I'm starting to like this good-deed business, especially when it's such a cinch. Yeah, our first good deed, and it's a sweet 'un. Here you go, kid. Put this in a safe place. [ Door opens ] [ Crickets chirping ] [ Gasping ] [ Tires screech ] [ Engine shuts off ] [ Crickets chirping ] [ Doorbell rings ] Nice joint. Looks like lake could stand to make a bundle knocking off his missus. Here's the sap now. Yeah. Yes? What can I do for you? How you doing, Mr. lake? I -- we understand you want to collect all the insurance by knocking off the missus, huh? Ugh! [ Coughs ] Well, that's just not gonna happen. Ugh! Unh! [ Groans ] All right, listen up, lake. I want you to pack up your undies and get the hell out of town. You bother your wife again, you're gonna end up in traction. I'm... the Butler. [ Breathing heavily ] Mr. lake's upstairs in the library. Thanks, pal. Oh. If he's the Butler, at least he could wear, like, a name tag or something. What, like "I'm jeeves, the Butler"? Don't be stupid. Listen, when we get up there, let me do the talking, will you? I don't know where this place I know. Here we go. Mr. lake? Hey! Lake! Come here to have a little chat with you, Mr. lake. Cut the crap, lake. Your wife hired us. Hey. Will you look at that? Dagnabbit! [ Grunts ] What the hell was that? [ Gunshot ] Damn! Thought you never missed. What are you, razzing me about missing? You're the one who saw the costumed misfit first. Why didn't you take a shot at him? Well, it doesn't look like Mrs. lake's gonna be needing a divorce anymore. She's about as divorced as she can get. [ Exhales sharply ] [ Chuckles ] Yeah. Check out the stacks of loot. Here you go, kid. [ Chuckles ] Hey. What are you doing? Put the money back. Good deeds, Mike. Oh, doggone it. It's one thing to take the guy's booze and smoke his cigars, but another thing taking his dough. It's wrong, kid. [ Exhales sharply ] Bingo. Looks like Mrs. lake's old man was a generous old soul. Look, he left $15 million to empire cloning and genetics. You ever hear of them? Nah. So, you got any ideas? About what? Uh, who iced Mr. lake? Ah. If I had to guess right now, I'd say a pissed-off tailor. [ Chuckles ] Uh-oh. Oh, you sick bastards! Hey, look, pal, it's not like you think, okay? [ Grunts ] [ Gunshot ] Both: Aah! [ Crickets chirping ] Ugh! [ Dog barking ] How you feeling? I-i-i don't feel very well. Were you sleeping? Oh, no, no, no, i-i never sleep. My fight against evil must continue. Well, don't you think your fight against evil's gone far enough? Answer me, Gabe. Evil must perish. No, no, listen to me, okay? You can't go on dressing in this costume, roaming the rooftops at night. It will come to no good. [ Stammers ] I don't know how to explain it, but I must. Just let me put a patch on this tear. Avon... I'd go nuts without you. [ Inhales sharply ] My angel. Oh, Gabe, Gabe... You're so... nutty. You have to talk to your doctor about this. [ Exhales sharply ] Evil must perish. [ Grunts ] [ Dog barking ] [ Siren wailing ] [ Police radio chatter ] Did you see anyone else? Uh, no, sir, just the two men, sir. Was there a Mrs. lake? Yes, sir. Where is she? [ Clears throat ] Perhaps at her apartment, sir. She often comes and goes without notice. Is there anything else you think we should know? No, I don't think so, sir. There is one thing. I don't know if this makes any difference, but the young guy was wearing a crude sports coat. How so? It was a most disagreeable plaid. Have fun. [ Exhales sharply ] Let's go. [ Electricity zapping ] [ Liquid bubbling ] [ Power surges ] Hmm. Be careful, doc. You don't want to mess it up. That's it. Can you hear me, buster? Are you awake? Dr. boiffard? What happened? I -- the last thing I can remember, I was shot. I was shot. Just be calm. Just be calm. You have a lot of adjusting to crept and mattress -- they shot me, and they left me for dead. I'm afraid you are rather dead, buster. Huh? But only temporarily. What's going on? How can I be here and over there in that giant Mayo jar? I have transferred your essence. Yeah. My what? Your being! And now it's situated in this body, which I've created out of a special alloy. It is practically maintenance-free! Get a load of me! I'm frickin' pink! It's just the casting. It's only temporary. Oh, doc, I'm pink. Why not black or silver? You see, your body will be frozen. And then, when I have time, I will clone several patches. Soon you will have the body of a 25-year-old man. Yeah, uh, and my brain in a machine. The essence! It's the essence. Hey, uh, tell me this -- this stuff here -- [ Metal [ clanging ] -- Is it, uh, bulletproof? Oh, uh, certainly, but it really doesn't matter. When your life force has been transplanted into your artificial brain, you can never die. Of course, it's only temporary. Yeah, um, how come you keep saying that? Uh-oh. He lost a leg. You know what that's like. Well, well, look what the cat dragged in. Don't say a word. It's been a bad night. You're working kind of late. Well, you know, try to impress the bosses. Oh, I have such an itch. Got any messages? Nope, no messages. Come on, you guys. Tell me what happened. Sometimes it feels good to get things off your chest. Well, Mr. lake is dead. Which we'll probably get blamed for. [ Clears throat ] And we were shot at and thrown into a pool. Mnh. Ran out of gas on the way back to the office. Well, do you guys know who the killer is? Not hardly. Well, what about Mrs. lake? She's a client. She's innocent. Maybe, maybe not. Thank you, kid. Thanks. [ Chuckles ] Your bra bothering you? Bills. Hey, marete, call Mrs. lake. Tell her we'll be right there. Don't tell her about her husband, okay? You got it. She's always cinching that rig. Hey, why don't you take it easy on her? She's just a kid. What are you looking for? The evidence. What evidence? The -- you know, the fabric I took from the windowsill, from the leopard guy. That'll never hold up in court. Here, but I got his will. This will -- [ knock on wall ] No one answers at Mrs. lake's apartment. We better get over there. [ Grunting, beeping ] Got you! [ Grunting, beeping ] [ Elevator dings ] Come on. [ Knock on door ] [ Knock on door ] Hi! [ Sighs ] You always leave your door open, sister? You assured me my husband wouldn't come here, and I trusted you. Yeah, well, that's why we came here. [ Sighs ] Somebody found him. Judging by the look on his face, he ain't going anywhere anymore. You mean...? Toes up, fertilizing the lawn, partying with the worms, uh, no longer with us. You mean he's...? Both: Dead. [ Gasps ] How? Well, we were hoping maybe you could help us. You got any ideas? No. I have no ideas at all. And there was this -- this cat guy. What? You ever see a guy on your property with a leopard outfit? No. Did my husband suffer? [ Chuckles ] Big time. I guarantee he suffered. Unfortunately, when the time of death is established by the cops and your Butler finishes flapping his jaws, mattress and me are gonna be made as two snappy suspects. So now we got to avoid any badges 'cause it's being played out that we've been set up to be caught over a stiff looking guilty. See what I'm getting at? Maybe if you talked slower. Did you set us up, Mrs. lake? Why, no, of course not. I've been straight with you boys. You've been here all evening? Yes. Good. Then we can stay friendly. I'd like that. What? That we stay friendly. Come on. Let's blow. And another thing, uh... What's that? Just out of curiosity, why the lps? Why not cds? I've got a thing for vinyl. Come on. Dagnabbit. Come on! [ Sighs ] [ Door closes ] Man, that Mrs. lake is a looker. If I was the marrying kind, I'd cheat on my wife with her. You're hopeless, kid. [ Grunting ] Hey! [ Gasps ] Ugh! [ Groaning ] What is this?! What do you want?! I'm gonna tear you into a thousand pieces! Who are you? Buster Lloyd! Nah, it's not -- you can't be buster. It's -- yeah, it's me! I'm the one who figured you two! Geez. But we shot you. You're a figment of your own imagination. What, you never seen a robot before? Not a pink one. Huh? Ugh! [ Electricity zapping ] [ Groaning ] [ Whirring ] [ Tires screeching ] [ Car door opens ] Oh, boys, boys, boys. We are a disappointment. Screw you, hornboy. We ain't going back. Yeah. Well, I just can't let you skip out on a frolic. I mean, I thought you'd realize the terrible mistake you made. Now you're going to have to be punished. I don't think so. We still got your crystal. Yeah, you sulfur-stinkin' fart. Aah! Aah! Ow! Ohh! Geez! God darn it! Unh! My crystal. I was thinking maybe you'd like to return it voluntarily? We don't have your crystal, but maybe we can get it. We're not going back! Make no mistake of that! Look, let me handle this, Mike. We can get your crystal, but it's gonna take some time. How much time? Soon. [ Chuckling ] Oh, please. You know I only make deals with fixed deadlines. All right, what about a week? A week? No, no, no. I'm much too impatient for that. No, I think, uh -- I think midnight... tonight. What, are you -- are you crazy? That's not even a full day. Midnight tomorrow night. Has your brain melted? Look, we still got 46 hours to solve the case. Case? We're presently employed. You got a problem with that? Oh, this is going to be fun. Look, we got a deal or not, hot shot? Oh, why not? But listen carefully. If I don't have my crystal in 46 hours, I will personally drag your bones back to hell and then skewer you with hot rods, from your asses to your mouths, and then slowly flay you over a pit of burning salt for 10,000 years. All right, we got the picture, tough guy. But one condition -- you don't butt in. [ Chuckling ] Oh, I won't need to. If eternity has taught me anything, it's that human beings are god's biggest muck-up. You were born defective. Oh, yeah? Well, let me tell you something. I had a couch, a lousy couch -- talk about defective -- and it was the same color as you. [ Chuckles ] 46 hours, my time. Oh, Dean crept, uh, you do understand that that car bomb was meant for you, not for your wife and child. Hey, forget you, you son of a thousand bitches! [ Chuckles ] A sore loser already. Oh, tsk, tsk, tsk. [ Car door closes ] [ Engine revs ] [ Tires screech ] I don't know, deano. You think we're doing the right thing? I mean, uh [Chuckles] 10,000 years being flabméed over a pit of burning salt -- i-i-i don't know -- I don't know if I'm cut out for it. Don't sweat it, mattress. We did the right thing. [ Classical music playing ] It's a good thing that Martin and Pete found you when they did. You would still be walking the streets. [ Mechanical whirring ] Aw, just hurry up. [ Grunts ] What was that? Oh, that was nothing. [ Chuckles ] Nothing. [ Chuckles ] Aah! [ Mechanical whirring ] Ah. [ Snoring ] [ Moans lightly ] You insist on going out in public, I think you should have a more pliant face. [ Both laugh ] I like it! [ Snoring ] [ Door creaks ] [ Gasps ] [ Groaning ] [ Whimpering ] [ Grunting ] [ Robot beeping ] I have no idea where the will you checked with his lawyer? So, you inherit everything? Right, Mrs. lake? I hope that's what my husband wanted, but I didn't kill him for his money, if that's what you're implying. [ Grunting ] Is that a confession, Mrs. lake? What? No, Petunia. It's not a confession. Mrs. lake, did you love your husband? He was my husband. [ Robot beeping ] Yes, but did you love him?! It was more a business arrangement than a marriage. We got along. You have a problem with that? Perhaps. [ Fists pounding ] Excuse me. I have a couple of questions to ask you, if that's okay. Have you seen these two men? They're drawn from your Butler's description. Yes -- last night, if that means anything. [ Grunting ] [ Robot beeping ] Are you sure? Of course I am sure -- Mike mattress and Dean crept. I hired them to find my husband's killer. Was that before or after your husband was killed? Mattress and crept are g-men. They were whacked a month ago, execution-style. G-men? I haven't heard that term in a while. Yeah. And someone planted a bomb in their car in case they got away. Well, I guess that someone flubbed up. Look, if you don't believe me, come to my husband's funeral at noon. I expect your g-men to be there. Excuse me. [ Robot beeps ] Hey. What? Knock off the "Petunia" business, okay? My pleasure, sweet pea. Ow! [ Chuckles ] Hey, you know, that is sexual harassment. File a report. [ Praying indistinctly ] You went to prep school, didn't you? That's right. Ah. I wish my dad could have afforded that for me -- all boys. Oh, those prep schools. [ Exhales sharply ] What were the showers like? Were they communal? My god, you are depraved. [ Tires screech ] Damn. They're still alive. Who is? Our g-men. It's them, sir. They killed Mr. lake. Thank you, but we have everything under control. Thank you, sir. We need to talk. Lieutenant Langdon, snap city police. It's okay. We're family. With names like Dean crept and Mike mattress, I find that highly doubtful. So, what do you want from us? FBI database shows us that you two have been murdered. Well, your computer must have one of those bad viruses. What do you want to do, arrest us for being alive? Cut the crap. I have an eyewitness that saw you both murder Mr. lake. Yeah, well, your witness must have one of them viruses, okay? You're batting .1000, bub. We think it's maybe a guy in a cheetah outfit that did it. Yeah, like in a Halloween costume. I'm &gt;&gt; not gonna take you in right now, but I want to warn you to stay away from the lake case. Mr. lake was involved in things you don't even want to know. That's all fine and dandy, but we work for Mrs. lake. Oh, really? Did she pay you to kill her husband? Maybe I can answer his question. There's a killer out there, and I need protection. That's supposed to be our job, ma'am. Yes, I know. I think we all better take a ride downtown. Don't mind him. Hey, look, do you mind if we go have a little talk, minus Poindexter over here, hmm? Sure. Hello, Mrs. lake. Look, we got a real important deadline to keep. We got an appointment with a real influential person. Who? Look, it's just best that we don't say, okay? If you know what I mean. The point is, we got to make that deadline. If we don't, we're gonna be in a hell of a lot more trouble than getting locked up. He's telling you the truth. Now, all we need is till midnight tomorrow night to wrap up the case, all right? Now, we'll either deliver the perp, or you can take us into custody. It's midnight tomorrow. That's 37 hours. Hey, Dean. What? Your family. We'll be at the old church on acacia street, midnight tomorrow night. I swear on the grave of my wife and my daughter. [ Birds chirping ] Find anything yet? Nah. Are there any other places where he hides documents? I wouldn't know. The police opened his safe deposit box this morning, but found only cash. I don't know why he'd keep copies of his will, anyway. He was always changing it. Uh-huh. How's your friend? Mike? Uh, he, uh, never seen their graves before. Why not? Well, their bodies were, uh, cremated in the blast. There was nothing left to bury. Ohh. Hey, deano, don't you think you've had enough? They put those graves there on purpose, Mike. Crept, they're dead. Yeah. So are we. Jesus. Now look what you did. Hey, deano, you're bleeding. You know what that means, huh? Does that look like a dead man's hand to you? Would you get out of here? Look, I don't know if it's the good deeds, but all I do know is that we got to solve this case, or else we're gonna be screwed for good. They're dead because of me, Mike, because of me and the scum I associate with. I got to live with that down there. I just can't take it anymore. I'm going back where I belong. I want to cut a deal with that bastard. Don't give in to him, okay? That is exactly what he wants. I'll give him his crystal back... If he gives you back your life to live. We're partners. Not on this, kid. I'm finished. Anybody I ever loved, I destroyed. Now I got to live with it. Hey, you didn't plant that car bomb, okay? Some sick creep did, and that's what we're fighting against. But it was meant for me. It was meant for us. Deano, that part of our life is over. It's buried. [ Crickets chirping ] What's going on? I'm not so sure. Listen, if you don't hear from us, meet us at the old church on acacia street, 12:00 tomorrow night. [ Engine turns over ] [ Tires screech ] [ Crickets chirping ] Cloven-footed "bee-ab-zabub" bastard. Y-you hear me, huh, you lobster-faced, horn-headed, sulfur-breathing, cow licker?! Dean, come on. Don't tempt him. Huh? You want to barbecue me for a thousand years?! Come on! You're gonna regret this in the morning. Let's do it! I'm ready to go! Come on. Come on. Let go of me! Hey! You owe me, all right? Let go of me. We got to solve this case, and we got to do good deeds! I don't owe you nothing, all right? This is between me and him. You hear me? Between me and him! I don't want to do this! [ Exhales sharply ] See, I don't like to do that ever. [ Sighs ] You're gonna get a little sleep. You're gonna rest up, and then we're gonna solve the case. We got to work on the case, all right? Come on, deano. I'm serious. [ Engine shuts off ] [ Car door opens ] Hello? Anybody here? Hmm. Fresh grave. Come on. Let's dig in. Ohh! Ugh! Ohh! [ Crickets chirping ] [ Shovel plunges ] Shh! You hear something? Ah. Nothing. Okay, back to work. You know, if you gave me a hand, I think we could accomplish this a lot quicker. [ Grunts ] [ Exhales sharply ] There it is. Come on. Let's get it open. [ Fabric tearing ] Oh, damn! I split my pants! Wh-where the hell am I? Hey, shh! Shh. We're on a stakeout, okay? Shh. Let go of me. Shh! How long I been out? Awhile. It's almost light. Ah. Looks like it's clear. Come on. Look. He's taking lake's body. You don't look bad for a dead man. Come on. [ Grunts ] Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Come on, you freak. Help me out. Come on. Hang on just a second, mattress. Slow. Yeah. That's it. [ Body thuds ] I'm coming home. Hurry. [ Engine turns over ] Mike, let's go solve this case. [ Engine turns over ] [ Tires screech ] [ Mid-tempo jazz music playing ] [ Tires screeching ] [ Power surges ] Oh, this is terrible, terrible. I hope we got him in time. ♪ I'm in a good mood ♪ ♪ I'm not gonna be rude ♪ ♪ 'cause I'm gonna get some legs today ♪ ♪ I want some -- ♪ Ohh, man! Watch it, will you?! If only we had more bodies to work on. Then our research would be much farther along. Yes, that, and more money, too. Bodies and money. Do you realize if this works, this man, who ridiculed us, this man who has no vision, will benefit... He's talking to a puppet. ...from the very science he turned his back on? [ Both laugh ] Are you ready? This really is a... [ Laughs ] What the...? Wha-- whoa! Ohh! Ugh! Ah! [ Glass breaking ] [ Coughs ] Bodies falling from heaven. I don't believe it. [ Chuckles ] We're not from heaven, pal. Actually, we're from hell. And you're Dr. boiffard, the ex-coroner, the guy responsible for all these human-cloning experiments. You're under arrest, doc. For what? Dirty test tubes? Try grave-robbing. Ha! Ridiculous. Oh, yeah? Puppet boy here stole Mr. lake's body, destroyed public and private property, went through four stop lights, and violated city speed limits. Then he led us right to you, the boss. You're under arrest, chump. Hey, who you calling a puppet? Back off, Pinocchio. We'll fix what we broke, flatfoot. Oh, yeah? You gonna return Mr. lake's body, huh? Ow! Hey! Damn it, stop it! Mr. lake has donated his body to science. Suppose you got documentation of that, huh? I suggest you check his will. I'd love to, but it's been dissolved. Huh? What? The water damage. Can't read a single word. [ Both laugh ] Ironic, isn't it? These two dopes have destroyed Mr. lake's will. I suppose that means we've lost our golden parachute. [ Chuckles ] His wife inherits everything. [ Both laugh ] So, you killed Mr. lake for the money? I'm a doctor! I don't kill people! I extend life! I bring souls back to life! Whatever, chump. [ Laughs maniacally ] [ Mechanical whirring ] I'm gonna eat your eyes out! Oh, look at robby the robot. Doesn't he look pretty in pink? Yeah, all the girls in lockup are gonna love a pretty pink plaything. No! No! Not in here! [ Laughs maniacally ] [ Gunshots ] I'm invincible! Ha ha! Ah! I'll rip you guys apart. And this guy -- I'll make sure you stay dead. You planted that car bomb, didn't you, buster? You killed my wife and my kid. [ Laughing ] Aim for his eyes, Mike! My body! Ah! Ah! Can't you do something, doc? Oh, I'm afraid that's impossible now! Oh, no! You're destroying my laboratory! Damn you and your damn lab! Hey, watch your mouth, tin man! [ Groans ] [ Growling ] No! No! Not him! Them! Get back here! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! [ Grunting ] Ohh! [ Gasps ] Ugh! [ Exhales sharply ] Nice. Ugh! Dr. boiffard. I told you it was only temporary. Please help me. Ohh! Aah! Whoa! What the -- [ electricity zapping ] Unh! Please! All right, listen up, bub. We ain't got much time. Now, where's the leopard man that killed greydon lake, Dr. boiffard? Looks more like a cheetah. What the hell are you talking about? And what about buster over here? He worked for you, too, didn't no! Busted worked for Mr. lake... Yeah. ...who was funding our experiments! That's right. I didn't kill buster or Mr. lake. I'm a doctor! Yeah, a good one, too. Yeah, well, we killed buster. We killed the rate twice. Yes, I know. I was there. What? You saw him pull a gun on us. Yes, from out of the safe. All right, you got to meet us at the old church on acacia street before midnight. Yeah, we got a meeting with the -- with the police. They want us for murdering lake and Lloyd. At least you can help us beat the Lloyd wrap. Well, perhaps I can. Catch you later. Bye-bye, coppers. Looks like we've been burgled, kid. Anything missing? Not that I can see. Oh, no! What? Oh, I put the crystal in the cactus. It's gone. You did what? You said, you know, put it where no one will touch it. I didn't think anybody would be stupid enough to go poking around in a cactus. Well, it's definitely missing. We got two hours. We're dead meat. Not so fast. [ Exhales sharply ] That's the leopard guy. Could be. Maybe. There you go, my friend, right as rain. [ Chuckles ] Here you go, crabby. Ah, you're a good man, Lester. You're a good man. Keep the change. Oh, appreciate it. Hang tight for a second, will you, my friend? What are you doing? What's the problem? Ain't got a government seal of approval. Huh? It ain't got the thread. What you got there is counterfeit money, my friend. And I know just the guys who suckered me. That means that the leopard's been working for the devil the whole time. I thought you said the devil wouldn't interfere. Wise up, kid. He lied. He's the devil. He ain't got no scruples. Well, if he thinks he's gonna send us back to hell, I'm just gonna tell him, "no way, Jose." You got it. The way I figure it, if the devil got the crystal back by cheating, then we still got a chance of staying here on earth. Come on. Hey! What the -- aah! Ohh! Ohh! Ohh! Well, well, things are starting to look up. Give us back the crystal. The what? Quit stalling and do like he says. I don't know what you're talking about. Really, I -- you gonna tell me this didn't come from you? That's polyester. I-i only wear natural fibers. He's right, kid. Take the heat off him. [ Breathing heavily ] [ Fabric tearing ] So, you gonna tell us why you whacked lake, huh? Ohh! Huh?! I-i-i didn't whack anyone. You were there. If you didn't do it, then you saw who did. I'm afraid that I arrived too late. Well, what do you know, huh? Well, I... I know that evil must perish. All right, that's it, you feline punk. Mattress, get the tool kit. Tool kit? Yeah. Hey, hey, hey, hold on. Hold on. Look, you guys -- look, look, we're on the same team, okay? I mean, I only fight for good, not evil. What makes you think we're not the evilest mothers that ever lived, huh? All right, now, listen. Time's up, leopard boy. What do you know? I'm cheetah man. Yeah, right. Okay. [ Groans ] [ Metal clangs ] Shoot. Hey, Lester, um, what are you doing here? Rent's not due for another three weeks. This is funny money! What? Buster's money must have been counterfeit. Gosh darn buster. Look, uh, this has just been a big mistake. Hey, it's no problem, pal. We'll get you clean money tomorrow. Yeah, I don't think tomorrow's gonna be soon enough. By that time, I think it's gonna be a little too late. Ah! [ Grunting ] Grab his arm! Aah! Ugh! Ugh! Ohh! Ohh! Get him over here! [ Speaking indistinctly ] [ Glass breaking ] Ah! [ Crashing ] Let's see. Follow the path of the righteous! [ Speaking indistinctly ] [ Groans ] Both: Wait! ...scriptures that they shall take up snakes... Both: It's weenie man! ...and thy shall be... He's wearing the crystal. ...that will not bite or harm you... Unh! [ Speaking indistinctly ] Ah! Aah! Unh! Unh! Yeah, marete. Midnight. The acacia church. Run. [ Breathing heavily ] Why am I doing this? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? [ Shouting indistinctly ] [ Groaning ] Shut up! [ Crickets chirping ] ♪ Bringing in the sheaves ♪ ♪ bringing in the sheaves ♪ ♪ we shall come rejoicing ♪ ♪ bringing in the sheaves ♪ Hey! Hey! Hey, what are you doing?! What are you doing?! Do you know who the hell I am?! I'm the reverend winiford! I got friends in high places, high! You mean in very low places, don't you, weenie man? Hey! Hey! Step away from the car! Hey, weenie man. So, uh, when did the devil let you out, huh? He didn't. But I figured if two morons like you can do it, so can I. Yeah. Sure looks like you're doing real well for yourself, weenie man. As a matter of fact, I thought maybe I'd help you redecorate. No! Oh, please! You know, it's great to see a guy really appreciate the finer things in life, you know? No! No! That's not necessary. Oh! Oh! No! Oh, my insurance isn't gonna cover that! Oh! Why? Why? [ Groans ] My, my, my, what a nice suit. Yeah. Yeah. It's a servace special. Hey! Hey! Hey! [ Groans ] You guys are gonna pay for this!

Hey, don't! He swallowed the crystal. Uh, looks like he's froze solid. Well, we'll give him to the devil. He'll thaw him out. Yeah. Be careful. He might shatter. [ Groaning ] How much time we got, kid? Two minutes to go. It's that puss-bucket sarcoph just trying to cheat us out of time. All right, hold on. [ Tires screech ] [ Groaning ] Hey! Shut it! 1:30. All right, big Ben. [ Tires screech ] [ Bell chiming ] [ Groaning ] I hope to god you got an explanation for this. Where's the chief? You're looking at him. It's my case now. Lieutenant Langdon has been suspended for conduct unbecoming a snap city police officer. And your prints were all over greydon lake's safe and buster's apartment. So I'm taking you both in. Yeah, I get the picture. Do yourself a favor, worm. Stay out of my face. You want an explanation, huh? Sit down and listen up. All right, I see that everybody's here. Thanks for coming, Dr. boiffard. I figured the police would be looking greydon lake's murderer. I wanted to dispel any indication that I was involved. Actually, we have every reason to suspect you, doc. Mr. lake -- he was funding your experiments. Then he gave you the brush-off, fired you, but you knew that, according to his will, you stood to collect a cool $15 mil. Now, you can buy a lot of tongue depressors with $15 mil. There was no will. Lake died intestate. The will was all wet, dissolved. Well, then it's impossible to prove that boiffard stood to gain anything from lake's estate. So there goes your motive. Except for -- of course -- revenge! Cool it, Sherlock. Dr. boiffard didn't kill lake. Hiya, gorgeous. Hi. Now, our client over here -- Gloria lake -- now, she had several motives for killing her husband. First, she inherits the balance of the estate. She dumps her abusive hubby and saves herself a fortune on Viagra. Don't blame her for marrying the wrong guy. She was young. Well, lake had a motive for killing her, too. Mrs. lake was getting close to discovering his counterfeit operations. And lake was kind of an old-fashioned kind of a guy. He didn't like witnesses. Yeah, we were getting close to lake. He was laundering the funny money through boiffard's operation, although boiffard -- he didn't even know it. It was buster Lloyd who was the beard. Buster Lloyd worked for lake. So, buster murdered Mr. lake! Would you sit down?! Actually, we killed buster -- in self-defense. Buster tried to kill us. No, deano. Buster did kill us. He arranged our assassination. You see, we were getting close. Lake had hired buster to frame us, and then he killed my family. And he set us up on a phony tip. So, Mrs. lake did it! What? Murdered her husband! She was in her apartment the whole time! Can you prove it? We don't need to. Well, maybe the two of you did it or your so-called leopard man. His name is cheetah man. Evil must perish. No, it wasn't him. We thought it could have been. He was there, but it wasn't. Yeah, first of all, cheetah man didn't have any blood on his suit, and believe me, Mr. lake sprayed a lot of bodily fluids. [ Chuckles ] But secondly, cheetah man didn't run till Mike pulled his gun. Next thing you're gonna tell me is that the Butler did it. I've had just about enough. No, no, I don't think you've even begun to listen. Now, why don't you just sit down? All right, the murderer was... Martin. How do you know? The stitching found on lake's eyes wasn't a surgical stitch. Dr. boiffard couldn't have done but it matches... The stitching used to repair a puppet! But -- sorry, Martin. You were both puppets for boiffard, weren't you, huh? [ Stammers ] Hey, what do you have to say, Pete, huh? No! Where's petey now, huh? Huh? Where is he? Hey, you ain't gonna find me in there. What the...? Dr. boiffard -- he had nothing to do with Mr. lake's death. Doesn't anybody stay dead anymore? Who the hell is he? My husband, greydon lake. Unh-unh, unh-unh. No, no, no, not anymore. I didn't ask Pete or Martin to kill anyone. You can't arrest Dr. boiffard. This man's a Saint. This man's my savior. Oh, my first essence transfer. A poor boy living on the street, no living relatives. They brought in his body to the morgue. It was hit-and-run. Let me see if I got this straight, doc. Now, you took Pete's essence and transferred it into a puppet? A puppet was all I had. Fresh bodies are hard to come what happened to the boy's corpse, the one you stole? Pete's? Well, I saved Pete from death, but it was early in my experiments, and the cloning failed. I-i waited two years for a new body. [ Chuckles ] So, boiffard sent you to kill lake for a fresh body and the money? No, no, no. I'm a doctor. I killed lake to help myself. See, if I got to him before he changed his will, then I had a chance. Doc could finish his experiments, and i-I'd have a new body. But mattress and crept showed up just before I could stuff lake into the sack. [ Sighs ] You're under arrest, Pete. Take them away, junior achiever. Let's go. Hey! Hey -- hey! [ Squeals ] Okay, now, don't make me kill her. Don't be a sap. When we get to the airport, I'll release Mrs. lake. Stand back, all you guys. Damn you, lake. Stay back. If you hurt her, I will hunt you down. I will never give up! You'll have the devil to pay! Did somebody say the "d" word? [ Gasp ] [ Laughs ] Hey, butt out, will you? Halloween's over. Peter, Peter, Peter, for me, Halloween never ends. Hey, hey, w-w-wait a minute, now. You two make such a nice couple, but as we say, till death do you part. Mrs. lake -- hey, w-wait a minute n-n-now. It's not what you think. Aah! Aah! It never is. Now, where's my crystal? Uh-oh. Forgive me if I don't come any closer, but churches always make me feel a bit uneasy. All right, you've solved your case. I'll Grant you that. But do you have my crystal? [ Groaning ] Both: Ask him. Uh... Winiford? Ugh! Yes, oh, most unholy one? Don't look at me like that. Hmm. No. It's -- it's them! It's the g-men! They were the ones who tricked me into taking the crystal, but I caught them, and I got your crystal back. And where might it be now, winiford? Uh... I ate it. For safe keeping. They were only gonna trick me. And take the crystal away. [ Groans ] Ugh! Ugh! Together: Ohh. Yeesh. Ugh. Lying is bad, but sealing is worse. Well, I take it, uh, you're ready to go home. Like I said, we ain't going back. No way, Jose. But you don't belong here. Oh, yeah? Well, that's a matter of opinion, bub. Now, we had a deal. You got your crystal back. Now scram. Oh, Dean crept, what about your wife and child? I mean, don't you want to join them? They don't live in your neighborhood, chump. But life without them? I'll see them soon enough. Don't you worry your horny little head about it. [ Chuckling ] You don't think you can really fit in here by -- by doing good deeds, do you? At least we can try. Yeah. Who knows? Maybe eventually, uh, we'll get it right. All right. All right. Have it your way. But when you don't [Laughs [evilly] I'll be waiting. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. [ Footsteps approaching ] [ Sighs ] What's the matter, kid? I don't know. I just feel like, uh, once we solved the case, a bolt of lightning would come up and send us to heaven. That isn't how it works. You got to do more than just solve crimes to get into heaven. You got to always do good things. How the hell does he do that? [ Sighs ] How we gonna know how to do a good deed? You did something good for well, yeah, but you hired us. I mean, that doesn't count. Yeah, but if you do something nice for someone, it doesn't matter if you're paid or not. Yeah, it matters. And how we gonna know when we've done a good deed? I know how. Yeah? What's that? Well, you can give a girl a ride home, for starters. Here you go, kid. I've got my own wheels. Catch you later. Catch you later, kid. Come on, Mrs. lake. Nice car. Hey, buddy. Do you want a Rolls-Royce? Help yourself. Gee. Wow-wee! Uh, you know, there's something you should know. What's that? I love, uh, bowling. No kidding. I was league champion in high school. Well, uh [Chuckles] you think there are any, uh, alleys open? I'm sure there are. [ Engine turns over ] Can I ask you a question? Yeah. Sure. Was that the real devil? I'll tell you what, kid. Why don't you let me buy you a cup of coffee, and I'll tell you the whole story, hmm? It's a story about two g-men... [ Indistinct speaking ] Yeah? Yeah. [ Chuckles ]
