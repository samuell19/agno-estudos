Do you wanna get some breakfast or something? Just talk a little bit more? I don't-- i-i should go. I just want to ask you a couple of questions about my aunt. I'm sorry. I might need another drink.

Yeah, to Sarah. - Sarah. - Cheers. How long were you married for? Twenty-one years. - Long time. - Yeah. What'd she die of? Sorry to ask a personal question. No. She had aids. Hello? Hello? Hello? They're not answering. Hello? How are you feeling, John? This is David. Can you say hi to David? Can you say "hi, David?" Fuck you, Mildred. Who are you? I'm a nurse, John. - The stroke was five days ago. - Okay. How does he look to you? Let's take a look. Well, he seems strong. You have experience in these types of cases? Yes, I do. Do they improve? Well, that depends on John, really. The doctor is coming in two hours. Okay, let's put this on the bed, John. But with therapy they improve a lot, right? Mildred, will you shut up? You can start today? Yes, if John wants me to. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. Do you mind if I close this? No, go ahead. Need to see the bathroom? It's right there. All yours. I shit in bed. Okay, good.

Just give me a-- just push back as much as you feel comfortable. Shouldn't he be on oxygen when you're doing this? Can you get out of the room? Good. My head hurts. You want one of my pills? I want you to leave. We'll be right outside if you need anything. Okay. What really-- really-- really scares me... Having to depend on them. They're scared too, John. You married? No. That's better. Women are unbearable. I'm just going to get this pillow out from under. You're fine, don't worry. I got you. I got your neck. You're an architect, right? Uh, yes. You can-- there. You married? No. I got-- I got divorced 25 years ago. I'm going to turn you, John, all right? So you tell me if it hurts. Okay, honey. Okay. There. I'm going to pull this across. So don't be surprised. Need you to hold on. There we go. There we are. You good? Okay, let me steal this one. Right under there. Okay. Be right back. So, what kind of stuff do you design? Hmm? Oh. I have some small buildings... Downtown and... Some homes in... San Marino. Good. It's nothing special, just f-f-functional stuff, you know? It's like... Excuse me. Do you have anything on suzin? I think we had something. Let me check. Okay. Mm. We had the taschen edition. It was his complete works, but we sold out. Would you want me to order it for you? No, thanks. What about suyida? I think so. Let me go check. Okay. Here you go. Thanks. Are you an architect? Yeah. My son is studying architecture. Where? Berkeley. Nice. What kind of stuff do you design? Functional, mostly. Some houses, couple of small buildings. Well, let me know if you need anything else. Okay. See, I like... The early ones because they're simpler. Isay weinfeld. Who? Isay weinfeld... Brazilian architect. Okay. You wanna look him up? No. Let me do it. Okay. Really? Really, John? That... that's art. I'll get you some food. I want to see it. Let me see it. Hello. Uh, my name's David. Uh, my brother... Uh, designed this place. And... John Sterling. Oh. And I was driving by and I was wondering if it's possible to take a look around. Come in. Nice to see you. Hi, Silvia. Hi. Be back in a minute. Did her tits get bigger? No, you got more desperate, John. He's on 200 mg per hour. Check the pressure. It shouldn't vary. And watch out for the oxygen. See you in the morning. Okay. Behave! - Call me if anything comes up. - I will. Hey, how are you? Is this comfortable? Huh? - Excuse me. - Yep. - Can I get a fresh towel? - Sure. Can I get it in a plastic bag? The point of the plastic bag is that your hands don't touch it before mine. Thanks. Thank you, David. You didn't need to bring anything. It's okay. Oh, ha! Happy birthday, John. Uh, iPad. Here. I'll just go back to the kitchen. Okay. Thank you, David. Really? You thought I'd bring you a hooker for your birthday, did you? I'm dying. Well, then you don't need a hooker, do you? You need a priest. I'm gonna go get changed. You're not dying. I'll bring you some food. Come in. Hi. I'm Lee. Silvia was sick, so I was sent to cover her shift for tonight. Right. I'm gonna do the night shift tonight. - It's okay. - Why? Because he's delicate, and he gets worse at night. Robert doesn't need to know. He'll still pay your shift. Are you sure? Yeah, it's okay. You can go. All right, thank you. Okay. You... sent him away? Mm-hmm. Yeah, I wanted to watch the movie. Was he handsome? Jesus Christ, John. I didn't get a look at him. What? You never been with a man? That's good. That's good. Isn't it the other nurse's shift? - Sorry? - The other nurse. Isn't she usually on right now? Yeah, I thought I'd stay. Did she not show up today? No, she did, but I just thought I'd stay. He was feeling tired, so... - You must be really exhausted. - I am. It's okay. Just, uh, let me know if you need anything, okay? I'll be downstairs. Mm-hmm. Okay? Um... After dinner I'll come up and sit with him, yeah? Okay. Wanna watch a movie? Hmm? Come in. - Hi. - Hey, David. Sit down. What's going on? They want to sue you for sexual harassment. Who does? John's family. His children. Well, I was just there. Why are you doing multiple shifts without permission? Well, John needed me. They found an iPad with pornography. John's son said John had an erection while you were bathing him. - And so? - He wants to sue you. He says you are manipulating his dad. For what? If we tell them that you won't go near John again, maybe they'll withdraw the claim. Okay. I have to get legal involved. Why don't you just tell them? I don't want another lawsuit. Don't go near John. Don't go. Don't call. I've asked Silvia to do a couple of shifts... Until I find someone. That's it. You can't be here. I never harmed him. If anybody else sees you here, it's going to be worse for you. How is he? He's better. Does he know about this? No, of course not. Can I see him? David, we're about to sue you. Hey. - Hi. - Hi. How you doing? I'm fine. Okay. When did you get back? Two days ago. Are you staying? Yeah. - I'm studying medicine. - I know. - It's good to see you. - And you. Did you get married again? No. You? I was married for four years, then I divorced. What does Nadia know? - About Dan? - Yeah. Everything. Okay. I'll talk to you soon. Bye. - Can I help you? - Hi. Is Isaac in? Sure, and your name is? David Wilson. Okay, one second. Just be a second. Okay. Hi. Can I help you? I was hoping to see your father. I used to work here. Oh, yeah. Yeah. He's almost never here anymore. - Is he okay? - He's-- he's fine. Can we write down daddy's cell phone number for--? - Yeah, sure. - Thanks. The only thing I would need is someone to drive me. The hospital insists on it. I don't know why. Well, David can drive you. Why would you work for less money? I was let go from another agency. I've known Isaac for a long time. Take me to chemo. I don't need any more for now. When's your appointment? I start again on Tuesday at noon. I'll pick you up. Isaac, you'll give me the information? Yes. I'll need a phone number. Yes, of course. Were you married? Yes. Any children? Trisha and Ana. They're 40 and 42. What do they do? Ana writes for magazines, and Trisha takes care of her children. We don't have to talk. Ready? We'll be back in an hour. She's on her second round of chemo. She's very weak. Do you think she'll get better? Mm-mm. I mean, it's possible, but no. At first I didn't want to study medicine. I mean, I did but I didn't. You know? Mm-hmm. Have you decided on your major? Not yet. I was thinking plastics, but more reconstructive, not aesthetic. Mm-hmm. Where do you wanna go? My mom wants me to stay here, but... I really want to apply to Boston. You should go to Boston. I will. Mm-hmm. Do you think of him? Yeah. You? Yeah. I remember him. Do you think it would've been different if we'd found out before...? No... No way of finding out, really. Do you think i was wrong? No. Really? Not at all. I remember he was always crying all the time when he was at home. Yeah. It's difficult... When it gets into the bones, it's difficult. Did you get on with your mom's ex? More or less. Good. They didn't really get along. Yeah. Tricky. Martha? Martha? Hi, Isaac. It's David. Have you heard from Martha at all? - Well, I'm... Martha. Are you okay? I couldn't get to the door. All right. I was just tired. Okay. Hi, Isaac. Yeah. No, I'm with her. I think she's going to need somebody to stay. I mean, at night... Just until she's a little stronger. Yeah. All right, I'll call you back. I'll call you back. I was... Cooking and I got tired. Right. Can I get you something? You want some water? Are you hungry? No. I'm fine, thank you. It's all right. It's all right. Just breathe. It's okay. It's just the chemo. I know. It's not the first time I've thrown up. Let's get you cleaned up, okay? All right? Just breathe. I'll be right there. Here we go. All right. All right. Let's-- let's get you up. Here you go. Okay? All right. Here. There we are. Do you want to shower? I want to die. I know you're being sued for sexual harassment. I'm sorry, but I had to find out more about you. It's okay. I should've told you. Isaac explained it to me. You don't have to worry. He told me about your son. He was very sick, Martha. My niece had an abortion. They found out the baby wasn't well. She did the right thing. Let's get you cleaned up, shall we? There we are. Oh. Yeah. Mm? I can do it. Did you sleep? Not a lot, but well. Would you like some breakfast? Oh no, thanks, i have to go. Hi. Hi. How are you doing? I'm okay, thank you. How are you? I'm fine. Working again. Yeah, I know. Do you want to come in? Sure. I almost sold the house twice. It was empty all the time we lived with mark. It was four years, right? Mm. Nadia wouldn't let me sell it. And your boyfriend, is he here? Yeah, um, yeah, Chris is here. He's going back to visit his parents for a little bit, but he'll be back. Yeah. Have you met them? Yeah, actually. Um, I met them a few times. They're really nice. Are they? That's good. That's important. Yeah. Especially if you get married, you know. The in-laws... You never know. I don't know if I want to get married. Really? - Have you been married? - Yes, yes. Yes. I have two daughters who are much older than you are. And, um, uh, three grandchildren. That's great. Boys or girls? Two boys and one girl. They are handful, you know? Sure. They must love you. This cooking is delicious. Well, it's been a long time since I cooked for them. See how it's white, healthy tissue? Normal tissue? After your treatment and when we did your last test... See this dark area here? That means there's metastasis. Rectal colon area. It's not really what we'd like to see after treatment. So... Does it make sense to continue the chemo? Yes. Even in complicated cases, we suggest continuing the treatment. I would suggest doing another round. If we don't, this metastasis will spread throughout your whole-- but it's most likely that it won't help because it's spreading to other organs. There's no probabilities with treatment, but I would suggest doing another round. I want you to think about it... But it's really important that if you're going to do the treatment, which I hope you will, that you do it soon. Hello ? Hi, how are you? I'm good. Yeah. I, uh, I just got my results. I'm clean. They didn't find any more spots. I know. Uh-huh. They're just gonna follow up with preventative chemo once a year. Yeah. No, they're sure. I know. No, you don't have to. Yes, it is. It's great news. Yeah. No. Don't worry about it. Whenever you can. Okay. Bye. My daughter. Before she hung up she said, "so, you don't need me to come over at the end of the month." If you can, pull over. You want me to get off the freeway? Yes. You feel like you're gonna throw up? No. Look for a bathroom. There you go. Something, anything? Nothing. Are you sure? Not hungry. What did the doctor tell you? - About what? - About the treatment. That you're responding well. Are you comfortable? I'm not doing it anymore. You help me instead. Well, if you don't want to do the chemo, I mean, that's up to you. That's not what I'm talking about. You care for me? If you care for me, then help me. If you helped your son, why not? You need some rest. I don't want to do it alone. Hey. It's all right. I'm not going to take chemo now. I cancelled the session for tomorrow. I know. They called. Did you think about it? Yeah. I'm not doing it. Then you should go. I don't want you to help me anymore. I'll-- I'll call Isaac. Do you wanna help us? Okay. Did you make the salad? No. Go ahead. It's David. Yeah. So, Martha died. Mm-hmm. Cardiac arrest. Um, I'll be gone for about a week. A week? Yeah. We talked about this. A week? Yeah, we talked about this. So if it's possible for you to come in before I leave so you can kind of get an idea of how we work together. Um, you know, just to get an idea... It's not hard, but it's good if you know ahead of time. I mean, of course, I'll always be available for questions and so on, but if you could come in beforehand that would be great. Is that possible? Yeah. How is it? He's sixteen. He's in a wheelchair. His coordination's off. - How is he with you? - Angry. Does he need help to eat, or... Yeah. Yeah, he does. But he can eat anything? Pretty much, yeah. Can I get you anything? Fuck off.
