[panting] [birds chirping] [heroic music] [man] It was the summer of 1875 and McKennna was a long way from home. He was married to an Indian girl, daughter of the tribal elder. She was waiting for him in a cabin on the mountain. She had a fever and he'd ridden his horse to death, to get back with medicine for her. [panting] There were dangers in the forest that night, not just the wind and the rain, and lightning. A gang of cutthroats, hired by timber agents from the Northern Pacific were waiting for him. They wanted his trees for railroad ties, but he wouldn't sell and he wouldn't deal. It was Indian land, given to him by his wife's father. He could sense the danger but by then it was too late. They caught up with him on the trail about the river. [grunting] McKenna fought them in the way of the Indians. Launching and spinning, grappling and swirling. [grunting] They had their guns, but every part of Jedidiah McKenna, a man hardened by rain and fire on the mountain, every part of him was a weapon. He was alone and there were six of them. [grunting] [man] Look out! Then there were five. [laughs] [yelling] McKenna had run 40 miles, from a trading post on the Columbia, but he was winning, he was billing them. [yelling] [grunt] They shot him though. Cowards that they were. And he fell tumbling and rolling down into the white water. [girl] He never made it back to her? He just drowned in the river? Come on, you guys. I mean, the guy was shot. He didn't have to drown, he was already on his way to the boneyard. He maybe is the river in our mountain. This is the Bigfoot story? Sasquatch, is that was this is? No. Is not about Sasquatch or the river or the gun. And you were right, Austene. He never saw his wife again. But he never left the mountain either. [peaceful music] [man] He was cold, lost in the eternal darkness, lying on the river bank in the wilderness. [snorting] But this time he was not alone. The forest spirit found him. This one had taken the form of a great bear. [growl] This is how the legend began. The Legend of the Spirit of the Mountain. I'm sure about this legend. We've all heard little bits and pieces of it. But he was shot, wasn't he? And he was drowned, wasn't he? [Brian] Guys, legends aren't true. They're just things that people want to be true. I don't know what better than to believe on it, Brian. -It has to be some good in it. -Justin is right, Brian. Must legends and folklore are based in facts. That's right. McKenna was shot. He was in the river all night. [growling] [screech] [roaring] [screech] [roaring] [twinkling] In the magic glade deep entangled all those years ago, the power of the forest, the power that could restore life to any human or beast harmed by another, that power was called down by the bear and it touched McKenna. And the spirits of the mountain joined in him. Then, the bear, the wolf, the eagle became one in McKenna. He could become all of them. In the Indian legend, a shape-shifter. And he would stay forever to protect the mountain and everything that lived there, and everyone who loved it. You mean he's a spirit now? A spirit of the mountain? Like a ghost? No, no, not a ghost. McKenna's spirit embodies the strenght of the balance of nature. [man laughs] Well, that's enough for now. We better go now or we'll late for the big shindy. [man] I'll tell you some more another time. -Wait. Mr. Madison? -Yeah? What's a shape-shifter? You know, like the one in the Indian legend? Well, Justin, a shape-shifter can appear a human, who has the ability to take the shape of those creatures he loved in life. He can even see through your eyes into your soul. No kidding? [chuckles] No kidding, Logan. Let's go! Ready to go, Justin. We won't be late. Yeah, I'll be right there. [woman] Make sure to put the fire out, honey! Yeah, yeah. -[Madison] Stacy. -What are you've been up to out there? -You're looking very pretty. -Thank you. What do you think about this big "get together." Everybody knows what I think. Do you think Mr. Madison makes it all up, you know, about the legend of Tanglewood? [Brian] Come on! He knows we hang around the old tree house. He just wants to give Logan the creeps. That's all. That is so sad. What's sad? He never got to see his wife again. Yeah, that's sad. [man] All we're talking about is cutting down a few old trees, alright? I understand, and to all of your concerns I'm still one of you, and like one of you, I only want what is best for this community. But remember, the unharvested riches that we have on our mountain can only bring prosperity and hope for our future, here in Tanglewood. Excuse me, Mr. Thorne, sounds like Thorne Lumber Company stands to benefit a whole lot. What about our alternatives? What about the wildlife? What about our nature conservacy? My staff and I are fully aware of the alternatives. But folks, let's be reasonable. I mean, the nature conservacy? There's no money on that. And I think it's obvious to you all hardworking people. But my harvesting proposal is gonna change this town around. And that's what we all want, isn't? -[woman] No! -[cheering] [whistling] My lawyers, my colleagues here, will be glad to answer any questions that you may still have. And I want to thank all of you for coming. Thank you. Thank you for coming. Very good. -I think they'll come around. -It's lovely. You two don't know what the hell are you talking about. [playing country music] -Can I offer you some punch? -Thank you, Austene. -Having fun? -Yeah. No. It's hard to believe that boy comes from this parts. He's driven by nothing but grieve. I don't get it. What are they willing to do to our mountain? You know, Logan, how can we be related? They're just gonna pick it clean, bonehead. Hey! Don't call me "bonehead", bonehead! -Don't touch me. -[Grunts] I guess we're just let the Town Council decide if that Thorne guy can log them out. Well, my dad is a logger, too, and he's never, ever, cut down those old trees. Yeah, you know, Mr. Madison says those trees are 600, 800 years old. No kidding? No kidding, Logan. Brian, what are you...? [scoffs] Oh, that's attractive. Oh, come on, you guys. Oh, Lord, help me survive my older son's appetite. Let's go. We got a big day tomorrow. Yeah. Logan becomes an official Lord of Tanglewood. Tomorrow. Where's your jacket, honey? -Daddy, where you've been? -I got delayed. I didn't mean to be late. I'm sorry, honey. I... I'm sorry, but you know... Yes, Daddy. I know. They're talking about the mountain and... it could mean "new job." It could mean everything for us. I... I should just stay. They can decide it without us. Come on, Daddy, let's go home. You need some sleep. Yeah... I'm pretty tired. Daddy, we'll walk. [Shirley] Come on. Good night, Daddy. [Austene] Please help my daddy to be strong and healthy. Bless our mountain with a gift of melting snow, a heart that give life to our forest. Please try to find a way to save it. Bless Mommy, wherever she is. And give her a thought of me and Daddy once in a while. We need your help so much. So much. Amen. Amen. [growl] [growling] [birds chirping] Remember, Logan, this is your first trip to the mountain. I want you to listen to your brother. Give me candy, Brian. Listen to your brother, and do everything he tells you to do. -Everything? -No! Brian, give me the candy. You had a good breakfast this morning. -[Brian] No. -[Shirley] No? Yeah. OK, you guys, have a good time. [Justin] What's up, dudes! -[Justin] Let's go! Let's go! -[Austene] Hi, guys! [hubbub] Listen to what your brother says, you understand? [kids yelling] I want all you kids to watch out for Logan! And chat with Clovis before you leave town! -[Logan] Thank you, Mom! -Uh-huh. He'll call me if you don't! [ominous music] Thorne, this nature conservacy thing is nothing more than a threat. They'll yield. The bottom line is greed. -There's nothing like it. -Well, you should know. Williams! You handled that impeccably. The prosperity and progress are always the best bait. I couldn't care less about the progress of anyone except Travis Thorne, boys. And so should you, too, because I'm your meal ticket. Williams, I want you to get survey teams on top of the mountain, first thing in the morning. Set up grids for clear cutting. 30 million board-feet of lumber are up there and I want it all. -You wanna use local labor? -What for? They don't want to cooperate. Scruples. -What? -Scruples, boys! Scruples! Like they sizzle in their own grease. [laughing] We'll get a temporary permit, we'll scrap the place, we'll have our money in the bank before they can file on us. And then you two geniuses, you'll just bury them in paperwork until hell is a ski resort. Holly, come in. Nevermind. Come on, let's go. I know what he meant. Got enough food, snacks, power bars? [all] Yes, sir. We got'em. [Madison] Toothpaste, extra brushes? [Austene] I got'em, Mr. Madison. So... You can't think of anything you might've forgotten, huh? [all] No, sir. Nothing. We got it alright this time, Mr. Madison. Right, guys? -[all] Yeah. -I see. Well now... this could be important, you know? Especially since your alternative is pine cone or tree barks. Oh... Oh, toilet paper. -There you go, Justin. -Thanks. -Put this in my bag. -Cool. Now, my young Lords of Tanglewood, go on. -And tell the mountain hello for me. -[Justin] Alright! [all] Bye, Mr. Madison! [kids yelling] [Austene] Bye, Mr. Madison! [Justin] See you later, Mr. Madison! [kids yelling] Hmm. Fill up that for me, will you? -You mean now? -Yeah, that'd be good. What happened to the conversation? Hey, Blaine. -How about a cup of coffee? -No, thanks. How about a cup of world-class chili? No, no. I had some of that last summer. And? When it gets hot I still taste it. [Shirley laughs] [grunts] Lately, he's been coming in whenever he feels like it, and that means less and less. Yes. Arlen... -How's everything going? -[Arlen] Couldn't be better. [exhales] Sorry, only got to one cup. Arlen, two years is enough time for all this. Why, Blaine, whatever are you talking about? Forget it, Arlen. She was my wife, you know? [sighs] Why not I just run my wife off, too? Then we can get drunk and sniffle about our bad luck together. I didn't run her off! If you could've just have a little more patience... -If you just understood... -I did understand! I understood you were the best deputy I've ever had till people started tripping over you. -Is there a point to all this? -Yeah! You got a daughter! Who's doing a pretty good job at taking care of you so far, -but it can't go on forever. -What are you talking about? You're on the slide, Arlen. And if you don't hoist up your pantyhose and get your life back together again, you're gonna lose Austene. Sooner or later, one way or the other, that's what's gonna happen.

I'm getting a little scare here. Wow! [kids shouting] [Brian] Yeah! Oh, yeah! Logan! Come on, man, this place is sick! [Austene] Come on, Logan Welcome to Tanglewood manor. [kids] Come on, Logan! [kids shouting] [Brian] We're here! Yes! Check out the hub! Logan, come on, man! Let's go! -[roaring] -[kids screaming] What? Yeah, right. I'm not falling for that. I'm no fool, you know. [Lewis] Come on, Justin, let's go! Come on! Come on! Come on! -Did you see what it was? -[Brian] It was a big gorilla. I swear! [Lewis] I don't know what it was doing, gorillas are only around here in the zoo. Well, one of them must've got out then. This is cool. [Austene] No, it was a mountain lion. I saw its eye. No, you're both crazy. I saw it. It was a bear. A giant bear. -[roaring] -A monster! Giant monster! Logan! -[Logan] Help me! -[Austene] Logan! It grabbed me! It grabbed me! Please, help me! [all shouting] [cans rattling] [screaming] [kids giggling] Guys, it's a baby bear. [all laughing] [huffing] Let me get that rag off you, little guy. Rags, that's a good name. [Justin] Hey! You know, guys, I wasn't scared. -[Lewis] Yeah? -[Justin] Yeah, right, Brian. Come on, you guys, I wasn't scared! [Justin] Come on! Rags is so cute. I know what you're thinking, Austene. Bear cubs do not make good pets. [bear cub snorting] Goodbye, Rags. [huffing] [croaking] [moaning] Oof! [Austene] That's a smelly job it gifted here, guys. Mr. Rags left us two piles of current cards. I'll get the water. My Logan, I'll show you around. This place is awesome. Come on, let's go. Mark it. [echoing] What was that? What? -Phill. -What? I don't know. It's... something. It's... This doesn't feel right. So... Just finish the job, will you? Yeah. [huffing] Holly, grab your gun. We got a bear over here. -Did he say bear? -[both] Bear! [cub whining] [Williams] Guys, hurry up, we're gonna lose him! [crack] [thumping] The danger signal. The danger signal! Come on, Logan. Let's go, guys! Come on! [huffing] [Williams] There it is! Now we got him. [screeching] [cub whining] Either of you want the shot? [Holly] Come on, if it's a fish, you got to throw it back. [Williams] That's not a fish. And it's worth something, no matter how big it is. Yeah? It'd worth a lot more if it was bigger. Huh. You wanna wait for it to grow up? They're gonna shoot Rags. [whining] No! No, you can't shoot him! Stop! Well, well, well. Where did you come from? Don't you know better than to run at a man with a rifle? You can't shoot that bear cub. You're right. Holly. I should just skin it alive. [laughs] No! Please! Come here, you little oogie boogie bear. [screeching] [screams] [grunting] Halt! Move one more muscle, and I'm gonna blow your head off. Oh... Oh! [moans] [screams] Wow! -Oh! -Gotta hurt! [Holly yelling] [all] Oh! Uh-oh. [cheering] Yeah! I don't know who you are, mister, but you're in big trouble. Get off the mountain. All of you. We have the right to be here. You can't tell us what to do. [growling] [hooting] [howling] [several animal noises] [Holly] Let's do what he says. What's the matter, Holly? You're getting superstitious on me? Yeah, that's exactly what I'm doing. Let's get out of here. [whining] [whispering] Rags, come here. Oh, Rags. I'm so glad you're back. I missed you. You were very brave, Austene. You saved his life. Where is his mother? His mother was old and sick. She died giving him life. Do you think it will be alright if I can take him home? Just for a little while? He wouldn't be happy off the mountain. His home is here, in the forest. -Can I be his friend? -You are his friend. [kids chattering] Where did he go? Did you guys see? I was just talking with him. Did you look at their faces? That was awesome. [guys agreeing] Are you guys blind? I was just talking to him. Where did he go? He just walk out after the fight, Austene. No, I was talking with him. Austene, you were talking to the bear. He said he was my friend. What do you mean he said he was your friend? -He's a bear, Austene. -Bears don't talk. Hey, Justin, Brian, one of those guys drop his walkie-talkie. You may as well toss it. One walkie-talkie isn't good for anything. -Let's go. -[Logan] I guess you're right. [Brian] Yes, man. -[Logan] Shut up. -You. [cub whining] Mr. Thorne. Give good news, Williams. All I want to hear is good news. Well, we nearly finish it. What the hell does "nearly" mean? There's some kids up there. School's out. I should've figured on that. Well, you let me do the figure, alright? And there's somebody else up there, too. Who? -I don't know. -What did he look like? A trapper. Some kind of hippie out of the '70s. You know, leather and stuff. Is that what happened to your face? Holly and two of my surveyors quit when we got back. They say you don't pay'em enough money to get busted up. Is that right? Then just find a few men who aren't squeamish about fighting, alright? You know, I don't know about that trapper guy but there's no mystery why those kids are up there. It's a tree house. [chuckles] I used to play up there when I was a kid. It was... magical. A wonderful place. [chuckles] I have some of my fondest memories when I... Just get rid of the damned thing. OK. [all yelling] [Logan moaning] [Brian] Yeah, just go... [Brian laughing] [Brian] You're ready? You're ready? Here we go! [Lewis] One more. Let's go, buddy. Logan, you made it! You're one of us now. You're Lord. [Logan moaning] [Austene] The initiation is over. [Justin] Come on. [Austene] He ate 15 sardines and he drank a chocolate milk. That's enough. He doesn't need to toss his cookies, too. -[Justin] Brian did. -I had the flu. OK, we need to do this as the sun sets. Why do we have to do it as the sun sets? We have to do this at sunset because that's how the generations before us did it. This is our vow. You know your part? We, the Lords of Tanglewood... Where the forest as for centuries did... [Brian] Cherish our mountain and all the earth... [Lewis] Love all its creatures and boundless worth. As did the ones who came before... And those will teach our wood and lore. [bonfire spreads] We ask you to leave it pure as found. We are to it forever bound. We ask you to leave it pure as found. We are to it forever bound. [all] We are to it forever bound. [hooting] [hooting] [huffing] [hissing] [hissing] [screams] Oh, it's you, Fred. Austene, Fred's back. I'll be right there. -Where is he? -In my sleeping bag. Wow... a snake. I think Fred is OK, but I don't want him in my sleeping bag. Especially when I'm in there. He's cold and you're warm. What did you expect? He's my Freddy, Freddy, Freddy. Ew... -Are we going fishing? -Yeah! Hey, Austene, maybe we could use old Freddy for bait. No way. [boys laughing] Hey, you guys just watch. I'm gonna catch some fish today. [soft music] -[Logan] Hey, Rags. -[Lewis] Rags, what are you smelling at? Hey, guys, I caught another fish! Another one! We're zip and she's got seven already. [laughing] Yes! She's just showing off. I hate when this happens. I hate it. Hey, Austene! Get your puppy out of the water! He's scaring all the fish! He's not scaring mine. Well, that's because you're over there and he's over here. Yeah! [whining] [kids laughing] [Brian] Alright! -[Justin] I got it! -[Brian] Guys, my face! -[Justin] I got it! -[Lewis] We caught a whale! Yeah! [trill] [all yelling] They'll be playing there all day. Let's go set the charge. [laughing, yelling] [ominous music] [laughing] [beeping] [Logan screams] -[Justin] What happened? -[Logan] I fell on a rock. -[Austene] Let me look at it. -[Logan] It was like a knife. [moaning] [screams] No! [Lewis] A minor laceration. Thought it was far more worse than this. We gotta get back. The first aid kit is in the tree house. -I'm sorry, you guys. -It's your first time up here, Mom told me to take care of you and look what you do, Logan. You crash and burn. [cub wining] [kids yelling, arguing] I don't care! Get that away from me! No! Logan. You know, it didn't really hurt at all. [Logan] Thanks, Austene. [Justin] Told you it wouldn't hurt. [Lewis] Listen to her more often, man. [Justin] You OK? Does anybody want to help me clean the fish? I gotta go find some firewood. I'm gonna go help him. I gotta go find a tree and take care of my business. I gotta go make a fire with the... firewood. Wimps. Come on, Rags. [beeping] Well, well, well. The miracles never cease to happen. I'm glad you realize that. Huh. I was hopping for this. I told you to get off the mountain. Yeah, you did. [yelling] [grunting] [whining] [yelling] Uh-oh! [hiss] Oh... [Williams] You're really slippery, aren't you? Well, fight this! -[Brian] A gunshot! -[Justin] Austene! Come on! They're the same guys. We'll call the rangers. I can't right now. Austene, what are you waiting for? Come on! I have to put the fish away or Rags will eat them. OK, well just catch up with the thing, alright? [Lewis] And hurry! [mystical sounds] [man screaming] [screech] Stay here, Rags. [screech] [beeping] [panting] -Sounds like an explosion. -Where did it come from? Sounds like the tree house. [Lewis and Justin] Austene! [cub whining] Austene! She must be in there! [Justin and Lewis] No! [Brian] No! Austene! Austene! Austene! Austene! Austene! Protective spirit, huh? Protective spirit? [Brian] What good does it do to believe in anything? Justin, we gotta get some help. Somebody's gotta help us. Somebody's gotta help us! Listen to me! Where was he when we really need him, huh? Where was he? [Lewis] Calm down and listen to me! [Justin] OK! Guys, shut up! Everybody just shut up! -[sobbing] -[Justin] Alright. Listen to me, guys. We gotta get some help, OK? Let's go! Let's go! [Lewis] Let's go. We'll go get some help. Come on! [Brian] No! We need to find her! [guys shouting] [Lewis] Go! Go! Go! Clovis. [panting] [Justin] Hey, Mr. Madison! [Brian] Mr. Madison! [kids shouting at the same time] [Madison] Calm down! Calm down! [kids shouting] -[Arlen] Austen what? -[kids shouting] [Arlen] Come on, get on the Bronco. Let's go! We'll find Austene. Let's go! Clovis, call sheriff Ramsey. And the fire sergeant. Tell him it might be a fire. Give me the sheriff. [roaring] [twinkling] [bear huffing] How are you feeling, Austene? Where am I? Was I sleeping? Yes, you were sleeping. Rags, where is he? Over there. What happened? Where are all the others? Your friends are fine. This is your home? Is this where you live? The forest is my home. Are you the...? Have you lived here a long, long time? A long, long time. I'm really sorry you never saw your wife again. Sleep. Everything will be fine. [Blaine] Arlen, calm down. [Arlen grunting] Arlen, come here. Come here. You gotta calm down. She's not here, Blaine! She wasn't here! If she... was here, we would've found her. -Alright, alright! -We'd found her, wouldn't we? [Arlen sobbing] Why don't you just beat the hell out of me? [crying] It wouldn't do any good. Nothing would feel like it. Come on. [Blaine] Clovis, come over here. Oh, God! God, help me! What would I give... Oh, Austene... Daddy? My baby! My baby! Guys, it's Austene! -[Lewis] Oh, gosh! -[Justin] She's OK! [Arlen] Oh, thanks! [sobbing] My baby! My baby! I love you so much. I love you, Austene. Austene, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for everything. Please, forgive me. Daddy, it's fine. I love you, baby! [eagle screeches] Still on the job, huh? -What was that? -I was just saying thank you. [screech] To the spirit of the mountain? [chuckles] You don't still believe on those old stories, do you? [Arlen] What happened on the mountain, Blaine? You saw it. How could anything would've live through that? I told you, Daddy. My friend helped me. You know, odd things have been happening on that mountain for a long time. It's not haunted, I know that. [pouring coffee] Enchanted, maybe. Enchanted? What happened to you up there today it reminds me of something that happened... 30 years ago. I took my wife out canoing in the moonlight. And it got breezy and it got chilly. And I wanted to move to the front and put my jacket around her. And I took a wrong step, I shifted my weight and the canoe turned upside. I thought I could hear her screaming, but before I could get to her, she went under. So I dove. And I dove and I dove, but I couldn't find her. I didn't know what else to do so I ran for help. When I got back, she was there. Cold and wet, and waiting for me. Something had lifted her up, she said. Something embraced her and carried her to the surface. And she wasn't afraid, and she knew I was coming back. How do you explain that? Some things you can't explain. I know what I believe, and you might not agree. But I'm thankful for the way things worked out. And you should be, too. [rumbling] What the heck? [ominous music] Thorne is on the move. He managed to get a temporary permit. He can start cutting the trees at noon tomorrow. [Arlen] What? We were supposed to vote on this. We gotta get a court order. This might help. I gotta call this morning from someone who saw one of Thorne's crew loading explosives. You mean... Thorne could be responsible for blowing up the tree house? Everything points at Thorne. Whoa, whoa. Justin, hey. Austene, what are you doing here? We have some emergency planning to do. I know the sheriff and the grown ups are gonna do all they can, but we can't just wait around. Right, after what they did to our tree house, guys. If we're gonna put our plan into action, we gotta move fast. Hold on. We got a little problem with our plan. What? Communications. They have CBs and walkie-talkies. I might have something. [cheering] [whirring] -[Thorne] Everyone of the crew teams have a radio? -[Williams] Yes, sir. And they're all in the same frequency? I checked them all myself. You'll make absolutely clear that nothing and no one makes a move without a direct order from me. Yes, Mr. Thorne, I guarantee nothing's gonna go wrong. I'll remember you said that. Buster, get that truck loaded up and follow us. We're taking the back road. Travis, why is it necessary for us to go? We don't belong up there. He's right, Travis. We're big city attorneys. We're not backwoods lawyers. I'm sorry, gentleman. I really am. Are you two certain that those permits are in order? Well, yeah, sure. But this is... Then get your petty butts on board! We got 72 hours to cut everything we can and get the heck out! So get in! Go! Move out! Get in. Move out. This is it. Let's do it. -Alright. You got the tapes and the walkie? -Yes. Alright. Then walk to the top of the hill and you'll be between Thorne and his men. -You ready? -Yeah, I'm ready. Go. Alright, guys. One, two, three! Push! Right there. [whispering] Guys, they're coming! Let's go. -You guys ready? -[both] Yeah. [Thorne] Alright, every out! Look alive! [Williams] Come on, ladies, just move it! Hustle! Hustle Hustle! We gotta move this log. Get this chunk of kindling off the road. And you two, come on, out of the car. You know what, gentleman? I think somebody's trying to pull my chain. [man yelling] [chuckles] We got thumb tacks in the log there, Mr. Thorne. [shushes] -It's the green weenies. -Weenies? Environmentalists. Get it. [Thorne] They're out there. I know they are. Continue, Mr. Williams. Do it again. Come on, you can take care of your boo-boo when we get back. Let's go! Lift it up. Come on, girls. Yes! [Thorne] I know you're out there. Huh? You little green weenies. Environmentalists? Are you afraid to show your face, is that what it is? Huh? Well, it's not gonna work. I don't need to see your face. Because I know you're out there. [Williams] Put your backs into it, girls! Come on! [Thorne] I know your game. Nothing new to me. You're afraid, right? Hiding in the woods like the cowardly little fairies you are. -Mr. Thorne! -Not now, Buster. Huh? And I'm tired of your nonsenses. Now, you might try to slow me down, dear, but you will never stop me. Mr. Thorne, the antennae. You understand? Never! Mr. Williams. You will never stop Travis Thorne! And no...! Never sneak up on me like that. Alright, everybody, load up! -Mr. Thorne. -I said now. Right? Not tomorrow. Not next week. -Now! -Yes, sure, Mr. Thorne. [Williams] Come on, Buster. What, am I surrounded by morons or something? Just get in the car! Hey, Austene. I finally caught one bigger than you. [engine cranking] Won't start. It's a brilliant observation, Mr. Williams. It's probably just flooded out. I'll get it. [engines cranking] [engines cranking] Potato... Two potatoes. Mr. Thorne! Oh, no. Time for plan 2. Just look what they put into the tailpipes. A potato! -A potato? -Yeah. I got two of them. One potato, two potatoes. [chuckles] You want one? What? Do I want one? He wants to know if I want a potato. [chuckles] Come here, man. Near, Buster. You are one of them, aren't you? You're a green weenie! They have penetrated. Mr. Thorne, it's not his fault! No, he watch for you, Mr. Thorne. -Hurting him won't do... -I don't want to hurt him. I don't wanna hurt him! I just wanna strangle him! -It'll make me feel better. Alright? -Alright. -OK. -[Thorne] Alright. Alright. Alright. I'm OK. They just wanna stop me. I think we can go now, Mr. Williams. -OK. -[engine starts] [officer] And another Thorne crew here. Do any of you believe that Thorne's gonna wait for a twelve o'clock deadline once he gets set up? Thorne? No. We gotta get that court order. Yes! You gutless environmental punks! If there's trouble you want, there's trouble you'll get! That's right, trouble! And its name is Thorne! [kids] Pull it! Go! Go! Travis... Whoa! [screaming] [grunting, screaming] [all] "Travis Thorne!" Hush, guys. We gotta go! [screaming] Oh... I stop. I stop... That's good. [grunting] Damn you...!

An arrest warrant for Thorne and Williams. -Great! -Let's go. [man 1] I'm gonna get that truck down to warm up. [man 2] We gotta wait for Thorne on the radio before we start cutting the trees.

Bad day? You can't imagine what kind of day I've had. Wait a minute. Aren't you that hippie? I mean, the guy that gave my boys a whip it, right? Hey, no hard feelings, alright? [nervous laugh] Look. I gotta get over this mountain over here. I'll give you ten thousand bucks if you help me out. -Why? -What you mean why? 'Cause I guys chasing me, that's guy. Why are they chasing you? Because I wanted to cut down a few trees, OK? Well, you almost burn them down when you were a kid... Travis Thorne. How did you know that? I never told nobody that. I know. [chuckles] It's true. When I was a little tiny guy I built this fire, one as big as I could. I mean, big fire. And then it started spreading. I didn't know what to do, so I just took off, running for home. [laughs] You know, to this day, I never figured out how I never burned down this whole mountain. I saved the forest from your carelessness. Now I'll save it from your greed. You kill me, you know that? [chuckles] You just kill me. [chuckles] Whoa! You believed in the magic of the mountain when you were a kid. That's... That's because I was a kid. I'm a grown up now, OK? You wanna know the... -[bone cracks] -Oh... ...only magic I believe in? It's the magic of the almighty dollar. How very sad. Well, sad this! [grunts] [moaning] [sighs] Yes, very sad. That the only dreams you believe in are the ones that you can buy. That's the only kind there are. Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Well, there's nothing I can do to change your mind. [deep voice] But maybe I can. [growling] Oh...! Wow...! [muffled laugh] Oh... -[roaring] -[screaming] Help! [screaming, grunting] Hi. I just had a vision. I feel reborn. You know, I love everything. I love the forest, the trees, the eagles, the bears, especially the bears. I love bears. I know I'm gonna have to spend some time, but it really doesn't matter. [giggles] I'm so happy I could sing. I love this land! From the rainwood forest I feel love just flowing through me. Hi. I've been reborn. You never seen a bear that talks, did you? Ever? [chuckles] I don't know, I love these trees. Don't put me in the cell with the rest. They're crazy. Please! [chattering overlapping] -[Madison] You saw a wolf? -[guys] Yes! Yes! I'd like you to wear this again, Arlen.
