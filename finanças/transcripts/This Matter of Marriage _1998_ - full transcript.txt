[music playing] [jazz music] DEVELOPER [ON MICROPHONE]:I remember the first time [inaudible] a derelict warehouse in a crumbling neighborhood-- a haven for squatters and drug addicts. And I thought, it wouldmake a lovely parking lot. But my partner suggested wetalk to Crawford and Mitchell. I said I'd never heard of them. But we met. And we started kicking some ideas around. That was two years ago. Now here we are, open for business. And every suite is rented. This entire neighborhood is in the middle of an economic revival. What was required was some money and vision. You I'll take credit for the money. But the vision thing I'm happyto share with the architects. Hallie Mitchell and Donnalee Crawford. [applause] [interposing voices] Well, it's not about software. The man who designed the TajMahal didn't have software. He had vision. And money. The man who designed the Taj Mahal didn't have to answer to a board of directors. That's a cop-out. We spend billions, and we end upwith a city full of ugly boxes. What about the Barr Tower? Eh, cold. "The Times" called it sleek and elegant. Sleek and elegant and cold. Hallie, [chuckles] Ibelieve this is Adam Barr. The Barr Tower is a block square. And it affects the entire neighborhood. A building should be morethan just a utility box. It should embody an idea,a soul, which is exactly what the Barr Tower lacks. Are you familiar with the Dunvegan project? The old railway lines. I have half a dozenproposals sitting on my desk, and I don't like any of them. MAN: Greg Cavanaugh. Nice to see you. How would you like a shot at it? GREG CAVANAUGH: How you doing? Hallie. Mr. Barr has just invited usto bid on a Dunvegan project. But it has to be somethingdifferent, something special. If you're interested, I'llfax the details over tomorrow. I think our lives havejust changed in some very fundamental way, Hallie. Hello? I know. We're gonna be rich and famous. And he's gonna fax us the details tomorrow. WOMAN: A wonderful design. WOMAN: Yeah, I like [inaudible] Excuse me. Excuse me. GREG CAVANAUGH: Hallie? Greg Cavanaugh, it is you. I don't believe it. What are you doing here? Oh, I'm with Dundest Trust in New York. We put the financing together for this deal. Did you know that I was the architect? Yes. Yeah, I meant to get in touch with you, but-- well, I mean, here we are. June 14th, 1983, DannyFlum's graduation party-- that's the last time I saw you. That's right. Did you ever find out who took your shoes? My green stilettos. I loved those shoes. There you are. Hi. This is Greg Cavanaugh, an old friend of mine. Hi. This is Donnalee Crawford,[LAUGHING] my partner. Congratulations. [LAUGHING] Pleased to meet you. Thanks. - Yeah. Listen, they're kicking us out of here. Are you coming? Oh, I'm going to take a cab. Oh, OK. See you tomorrow. GREG CAVANAUGH: Nice meeting you. DONNALEE CRAWFORD: You, too. Are you married? No. You know, I'm not surprised. I always expected you to do something original. This-- I mean, this isexactly how I pictured you. - Really? - Really, yeah. Oh. Well it hasn't been easy. Architecture is a man's game, usually. But we-- Ah, right there, honey. That's my wife. Oh, c-- Listen, I might be back in town soon. If you want to get together-- Oh, sure, any time. Yeah? Sure. OK. It's good to see you, Hallie. You, too. Take care. Bye. [strings music] [lawn mower running] Hi. - Hi. Hey. [dialing numbers on phone] [dial tone] [beeps] AUTOMATED MESSAGE [ON PHONE]:You have no new messages. [beep] [sighs] [water sputtering] [doorbell ringing] [doorbell ringing] [LOUD] Coming. Hi. Is your water pressure on? No, not really. [snaps] I knew it. Excuse me, who are you? Can I see some ID, please? Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, I'm Steve Marris. I'm-- [chuckles] I'm tryingto move in next door. Oh, I thought you were one of the movers. Oh, yeah, right. [chuckles] [snaps] Kitchen. I just hooked up my washingmachine in the basement there, but there was no, uh-- no water pressure. But there was water pressurein the upstairs bathroom, which is, uh-- it's pretty weird, if you know anything about these things. Just a little. Hey, how long was my house empty? It was empty when I moved in here. Huh. And you never had a problem before? No No. Hey, you wouldn't happen to have the, uh, blueprints to this place, would ya? - Blueprints. - Yeah. You can tell a lot about the plumbing if you know how to read them. [SARCASTIC] Really? Is that what a blueprint is? Oh, you'd be amazed at what these builders and these fancy architects tryto get away with, you know, especially if it's stuff you can't see. But hey, you know, who wantsto dig up a water pipe, right? - Not me. - Yeah. Hey, I'm sorry, I didn't get your name. Hallie Mitchell. Hallie Mitchell. Nice to meet you. [LOUD] OK, thank you. [music playing] [dog barking, cricket chirping] Megan, how's the water now? Megan? [crying] Hey, wiggler. What ya doing? I hate this place. I want to go home. I know. I know you do. OK? But look, right now, this is our home. Why is Mommy doing this? I don't know. Well, I guess, you know, sometimes people just need to spend some time alone. So you're not gonna get divorced? No, honey, we're not gonna get divorced. See, we still love each other, OK? And we're gonna work-- we're gonna try and work this out. [kisses] I promise. JORDY RANDALL: Did she reallytell Adam Barr [CHUCKLING] his building has no soul? Hallie, bravo [clapping] From Barr's office, all thespecs we need and a little note from the man himself-- "Something different." Well, something different. That's us. It's in the bag, I tell ya. We got six weeks. Six weeks. OK, that's two additionalstaff for six weeks, equipment, preliminary models, software. We can just barely coverit on the line of credit. No contingencies. And assuming we don't get the contract, we're back in debt, where wespent so many happy years. Who was that guy you were with yesterday? Greg Cavanaugh, a guy I went to college with about 1,000 years ago. Greg was a golden boy-- youknow, handsome jock, tons of friends, wealthy parents. You know, the kind of guy you just wanna kill. That's an option. I had a terrible crush on him. But, of course, he never knew. And until last night, the last time I saw him was Danny Flum's graduation party. I, of course, was there with a geek named Rodney Philpot, who wasall over me like a bad smell. And then somebody took my shoes. And I lost track of Greg by the gazebo. And now he's married to a willowy blonde. Story of my life. What is? Me, men. That is ridiculous. You just haven't met the right guy. When I do, I scare them off. What's the matter with me? You know, I can tell somebillionaire developer like Adam Barr that he's got no taste. But if I meet someonethat I like or might like, I can't even remember my own name. Hallie, if you want to win the lottery, you gotta buy a ticket. You don't even try. Do you? [sighs] Executive Introductions? You joined Executive Introductions? I don't believe it. Oh, honey, there's got to be a better way. Like what? Cocktail bars? Lounges? I'm 38, I'm single, I wanta husband and children, and I'm busy. It's convenient, cost-efficient. You make a video. You fill out a spec sheet.You browse. They browse. It's like shopping online. It is shopping online. Have you had a date yet? Have you? You know, I've seen those infomercials. Hairy men with gold chains and bimbos-- no thanks. You're not gonna find a man in there. . Steve, my neighbor, asked me to look for blueprints for my house because I'm having a plumbing problem. And don't even ask. Is he single? Possibly. I didn't see a wife. Is he cute? You know, I'm trying to imagine him under that stupid hockeycap and all the grease. See, listen to you. You don't even know who this guy is, and already you've passed judgment on him. Believe me, he's not what we're looking for. Oh, and what is it that we're looking for? Tom Cruise, DenzelWashington, Richard Gere. Cute? Who, my neighbor? You've gotta be kidding me. Absolutely, if you look at the whole package. Whole package? There's-- there's nothing there. Probably lives on celerysticks and cottage cheese. She's kind of snotty, too. Oh, you mean she's got a mind of her own. Is she married? Well, it didn't look like it. No kids, either. I was kind of hoping theremight be a family there, you know, for Megan. How is she? Meg? Oh, well, you know, last night was kind of rough. But yeah, we're gonna be OK. Did Megan sleep OK? Yeah, she's fine. She, uh, just doesn't understand, that's all. [playful shouting] [laughs] Steve, stop. So, uh-- so what did you want to show me? Do you remember mysister's friend, Kip Caulker? Yeah, the, uh, window dresser. Fashion designer. He wants to lease this place and open up a boutique for kids' clothes. So he wants you to work for him? He wants me to be his partner? You? Yes, me. I showed him some designs,and he liked them. Uh-- I made all of Megan'sclothes when she was young and stuff for Tiffany and Sarah. But Marylynn, sewing a dress for your niece is not the same as running a business. [SARCASTIC] Thanks, Steve, as always. Whoa, wait, wait, wait a minute. I'm not saying you can't sew. It's not sewing. It's designing clothes. Fine, fine. All I'm saying is, you know, what do you guys know about running a business? For starters, who's gonnaput up the money here? I mean, you guys are gonna need at least a couple hundred thousand. 250. Kip's putting up a hundred,and the bank's gonna match him. If I want in, I have to come up with 50,000. I see. It sounds like I'm thepartner he wants, not you. I'm gonna do this. And if I can't get the money from you, I'll get it somewhere else. [hammering] Kip Caulker? Yeah. I think I remember him fromone of Aunt Katie's barbecues. Short guy, kind of-- kind of chubby. Married? I don't remember. So what do you think? I always liked Mom's stuff. [doorbell ringing] I'll get it. Hi. Is Steve here? Steve Marris? - Hey. Oh, hey. Blueprints. Yeah, I'm gonna need these. Oh, Megan, this is, uh, Hallie-- Mitchell. Mitchell. Yeah, our next-door neighbor. That looks interesting. These are my mother's. Oh, I haven't met your mother yet. Is she out of town? Um, she's-- she's not living here. Oh. Yeah. Actually, what I need to do isto get down to your basement there so I can have a look at the main. Sure. How about now? OK, well-- well, maybe after dinner. Great. You know, I'm just eating leftovers. There's plenty for all of us. MEGAN MARRIS: I'm eating at Becky's. [clears throat] Well, how about you? Yeah, OK. Thanks. - I'll see you in a little bit.- Great. Great. Bye. Bye-bye. This is not a date. [sizzling] Don't be ridiculous. DONNALEE CRAWFORD [ON SPEAKERPHONE]: Mhm. Where's the wife? I don't know, somewhere else. DONNALEE CRAWFORD [ON SPEAKERPHONE]: I thought he was a grease-ball. He changed his shirt. DONNALEE CRAWFORD [ON SPEAKERPHONE]: Hey, listen, if that's a wok I hear sizzling, throw in some beef or pork,or he'll think you're one of those celery stick queens. This is not a date. DONNALEE CRAWFORD [ON SPEAKERPHONE]: Bye. [beep] [doorbell ringing] This is not a date. Hi. Hi. So, uh, where's your basement? Um-- Yeah, I think what they did was use one main for both housesand then put a splitter in. But see if there's a leakon either side of the split, well, you know, we both lose water pressure. I see. Oh, OK. Oh, you know what? I'm gonna need you to stay uphere to check the pressure. All right? OK. All right. Try it now. It's fine. [clanking] STEVE MARRIS: How about now? Anything? Oh, my god, there's blood coming out. STEVE MARRIS: There's what? It's fine. Well, I'm not gonna findanything down there unless I start breaking down walls. - We don't want to do that.- No. No, We don't. Um, hm. Well, I guess I could go outside and just, you know, dig around a little,see if I can find a pipe, maybe. Or maybe I should go home and change. [chuckles] - I'll tell you what. Why don't you go upstairs and wash up. I've got an oversized sweatshirt. I'll pull one out. And then let's just eat. Yeah, OK. Good. [music playing] [faucet running] [knocking on door] HALLIE MITCHELL: This ought to fit. Oh, um-- thanks. Hey, so what is this, like, Chinese? No, it's vegetable stir-frywith beef and sliced ginger. [piano music playing] Oh, yeah, there's a little guy. Um, I didn't realize, you know, you were gonna go to all this trouble here. Oh, it's no big deal. So you're not married? Um, no. No. And you and your wife? Separated. Yeah. I see. And she's a clothing designer? Marylynn? No, no. Actually, she was still inschool when we got married, you know. And Megan kind of snuck up on us, you know. So that's pretty much what she did. And yeah, now she wants to openup a clothes store for kids. [chuckles] Good for her. Those designs I saw were great. Well, yeah. But I mean, it's a long wayfrom doing a few sketches to running a business. Really? I didn't know that. Are you in business? Mitchell and Crawford,architects and designers. Hm. Yeah, well, you know, it's,like, a temporary thing, like a phase she's going through, I guess. A phase. You mean like she's tiredof devoting her entire life to other people, and now she wants to make her own dreams cometrue-- design some clothes, open a store, get a little empowerment, a little self-respect? You mean, like, that kind of phase? [light chuckle] Sorry. I'm sure it's not easy for either one of you. Yeah. Well, you know, it'sdifferent when you have kids. Anyway, um, I'm sorry. I think I've given you the wrong impression. What do you mean? Well I mean, you know, this fancy dinner here. What? You seem a little ticked. Steve. You don't actually think this is a come-on, do you, just because I have clean dishes and a little stir-fry? [chuckling] You really need to get out more. Jeez, look at the time. No, wait, wait a minute. I didn't mean to suggest anything. I-- - Oh, that's all right. You done? STEVE MARRIS: Well-- Don't backtrack. It was cute. Dumb, but cute. Resumes. - Thanks. How was your date? It was not a date. And another thing, Jordy, howcome every time a guy meets a single woman, no matterhow together she is and how dysfunctional he is, he thinks her life is so devoid of meaning and purposethat all she wants to do is marry him and have his babies, huh? Answer me that. I personally don't feel that way. Good answer. DONNALEE CRAWFORD: He made a pass at you? [SARCASTIC] Oh, please. So what happened? He entertained me with this witty conversation, mostly about his wife, who was going through a phase of wanting to have a life of her own, silly creature. These are the only two we can afford, if we're gonna go ahead. Of course we're gonna do this. So how was your evening? Uh, quite pleasant. Sandy and I went to the symphony. Who? [COY] Oh, Dr. Sanford Lafferty, just some guy I met through Executive Introductions. - You met a doctor? - Yep. Donnalee, I don't believe it. He has a very good reputation. [snap] Hi. My name is Hallie Mitchell. And I'm, um, thir-- how old should I be? [snap] Does he have to keep snappingthat thing like that? [snap] Hi. My name is Hallie.

I've never been divorced or separated I like cooking, hiking, andtalking dirty on the phone. DONNALEE CRAWFORD: Cut. [laughter] Hi. My name's Don. I'm recently divorced. I have three teenage children. And I'm looking for a woman whoneeds stability and security. That means no sex. [warped audio] I'm 46. I'm an account executive witha local systems design company.

I'm looking for a professional woman with an independent mind,sophisticated, liberal, empowered, but still has afondness for the opposite sex. DONNALEE CRAWFORD [ON SPEAKERPHONE]: Don't Murphy Brown him. What does that mean? DONNALEE CRAWFORD [ON SPEAKERPHONE]: You can let him know you'reintelligent without beating him into the ground. And let him do the talking. Why? DONNALEE CRAWFORD [ON SPEAKERPHONE]: You won't have to think of dumb things to say. And he'll be thinking he's having an intelligent conversation. Do you think I should be writing this down? DONNALEE CRAWFORD [ON SPEAKERPHONE]: Yes Mmm, and let him pick the wine. Why? I know about wine. DONNALEE CRAWFORD [ON SPEAKERPHONE]: Because guys have turned it into one of those competitivethings, like sports trivia. And whatever you do, donot talk about his ex-wife. There is no ex, remember? He's single. DONNALEE CRAWFORD [ON SPEAKERPHONE]: There's an ex-somethingTrust me, whatever it is, don't go near it. It is dangerous. Oh, my god, I gotta meetthis guy in half an hour. I'm not even dressed. DONNALEE CRAWFORD [ON SPEAKERPHONE]: Bye. [dial tone] [beep] [sighs] Hey, so I thought Kip wassupposed to come by today. Is he afraid to meet me? You already met at Katie's. He was the short one, right? Uh, bald? Not really. Daddy, look. Yeah. So? What's your answer? Well, I don't have $50,000 cash. You can borrow it. And what am I supposed to do,use the house as collateral? Or maybe my business? Yeah, I don't think so. Suit yourself. [dramatic music] MEGAN MARRIS: Mommy, come back. Mommy. Is it really the money, or are you afraid I'll succeed on my own without you controlling everything? Come on, I don't control you. I never did. MARYLYNN MARRIS: You didn't have to. I did whatever you wanted. STEVE MARRIS: [SARCASTIC] Yeah, right. Yeah right. Hi. Hi, I'm Hallie Mitchell. Marylynn Marris. Did your mom make that? Stay for supper? I can't, honey. I've got too much work to do. With Kip? That's not fair. This is important to me. You're not fair, either. What about us? Megan, honey. [music playing] [slams door] So how long were you in India? About two years-- a year at the ashram, and thenwe were just drifting around. Get to see the Taj Mahal? Yeah. How was that? My stomach was acting up. That's actually what Iremember the most about India was all my stomach problems. Temples and restaurants, acouple of times on a bus. Naturally, the bus driver wouldn't stop. [laughs] That would be memorable. So what brought you home again? A woman. You're a mountain climber, too? I usually don't like talking about it. You know, I've always wanted to go to India. But I feel comfortable with you. You don't have to talk about it. I feel as though I could tell you anything. I don't think I want to hear it. I want to. I want to. We were together for about eight years. It was love from the moment we met. Now, that's funny, becauseyour ad said you were single. [chuckles] Well, we were married, but wedidn't believe in convention. She was my other half. She made me whole. What happened? She betrayed me with my best friend-- oh, in my bed. [weeping] Oh, uh, Dana, maybe we should-- No. No, it's OK. I've earned these tears. You know? It's taken me so long to acknowledge the pain and come to terms with the anger and hurt. [crying] And I've learned to stop blocking these feelings inside. And I've learned to trust again, you know? I trust you. [WEEPING] I really do. [IMPATIENT] Check. [WHISPERING] Stupid. Ow. [inaudible] I'm not [inaudible] right now. And nothing is going to stop me [inaudible].. [knocks on door] I never said you could startdigging up my front lawn. I nearly broke my neck out there. There's a lead. I'm thinking maybe youshould call somebody who knows about these things, like-- [SARCASTIC] oh, I don't know-- a plumber? How was your day? [kettle whistling] I'm just going to make myself a cup of tea. Would you care to join? You're standing there in your underpants. Excuse me, these are workout shorts, OK? Is that a yes or no on the tea? [kettle whistling] Hey, uh, by the way, I'msorry about the other night, that stuff. That's all right. At least you didn't burst intotears in the middle of dinner. He did that? Yep. In the restaurant? Yep. What'd you do to him? I didn't do anything to him. [laughing] You know, a woman does something like that, and she's sneaky and manipulative. A guy pulls a stunt like that, and he's working through his feelingsor trying to get in touch with his feminine side. His-- his feminine side? What, you don't thinkguys can have one of those? I think this looks better, don't you? Yeah, no, that is. It's-- well, you know, you've got great taste. I like the stuff at your place. It's nice. That dress looked cute on Megan. Did your wife design that? She did. Well, she's got pretty great taste herself. Yeah, well, then she wants me to, uh, loan her 50,000 bucks for her shop. Well, maybe she'll make a whole lot of money. Well, maybe. But see, it's not about the shop here. It's about us. I mean, she has no experience. And I don't even know who her partner is. But if I don't give her themoney, I want her to fail. Well, maybe this has nothing to do with you. Maybe she just wants a loanand she'd accept or reject the plan based on its merits. It wasn't me. I swear to you, he brought it up. He burst into tears? You must have done something. So how's the doctor? Sandy's good. He asked me to marry him. On your fourth date? [chuckles] Great. Some guy you met in cyberspace-- I said yes. No, you didn't. Yeah, I did. Why not? It's good to be with somebody, Hallie. Oh, Donnalee. Do you love this guy? If I was 18 and felt this way? No. But I'm 38. It's not about mad passion. And I want a friend, a father for my children. Does that sound too square? No. It sounds great. I'm very happy for you. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah? Mhm. [music playing] [warped audio] Hi. My name is Henry. I'm 36. I'm an accountant. And I'm looking for someonewho wishes to investigate alternative lifestyles. What is it about accountants? [warped audio] Hi. My name's Ted. And I'm a stock broker.

I didn't mean to. I use a laundry service. It must've been in the basket. Mm. Well, I guess I must have your sweatshirt around here somewhere. Oh, I'll get it sometime later. Listen, I'm sorry about the other night, mouthing off about your wife. Talk is cheap, as Momma Mitchell used to say. Ah, well-- Dad, ask her. Ask me what? Ah, it's like a school project. They have to give a talk about a career, but it can't be their parents'. What do I have to do? Just answer some questions. Sure, that sounds fine. How about tomorrow? HALLIE MITCHELL: OK Great, thanks. Hey, can I ask you something? Yeah, shoot. [sighs] What do you thinka guy looks for in a woman? I mean, on a first date, first impression sort of thing, your honest opinion. Uh-- HALLIE MITCHELL: Oh, come on. No, no, no, no. You're gonna-- you'll get mad. Try me. All right. Well, it's pretty basic, really. No matter what guys say or what they pretend, most men, in my experience,like a woman who's, well-- Oh, well, that is pretty basic. Now, we're talking first impressions. Yeah, no, I understand. We're just saying right off the bat. - Right, uh-huh, big bazoongas.- Yeah. Mhm. Well, it's like, you know, like, when you're away at thecottage at night and it's pitch black out, you know. And you look across the lake there, and you see a light coming fromthe cottage on either side. See, that's what a woman's-- is to a guy. It's shelter. A beacon, if you will. Well, you know, it's the way home. You know, even if you never go there. My god. A cleavage theory of the universe. Why am I not surprised? You asked. Yes, I did. I did, indeed. Goodnight. 'Night. [music playing] [knocking on door] LARRY MERCER: Hallie? It's Larry Mercer. Do I have the right door, oris it the other side here? I couldn't find [inaudible]. Hi. I-- I made reservations at O'pris.

I owe you one, beacon in the night. - Oh, you, uh-- you had a date?- Oh, yeah. And we're going out again. Well, what can I say? You know, some things are just true. So what is this now? It's the railway lands projects. We're submitting a proposal. Yeah. Looks like the Barr building. You know that skyscraper there on Water Street? Yeah, I know. But it doesn't look anythinglike the Barr Tower. Oh. I guess they all look the same. Anyway, thanks again. OK, Come on. MEGAN MARRIS: Bye, Hallie. See ya, Megan. [music playing] Better. I like it. I don't All we've done is take two towers and turn them into four. What if we had-- oh, it stinks. What's the matter with me? We're running out of time, Hallie. I know. All right. So why don't we just lose the high-rises and turn it into a bunch of smaller buildings. It'd look like council housing. JORDY RANDALL [ON SPEAKERPHONE]:Donnalee, call on line 1. Mitchell and Crawford. Hi. Um, I don't know. We've got a few problems here. Can you just hold on for a second? It's, uh, Sandy. We've got a date tonight. Are we gonna be, um, working late, or?

It's good exercise. Mm. Trouble is, is we, uh, wedon't have an overall look yet. What do you think of thesefor window treatments? Curtains. No, I know, I know.

[sliding shower curtain] - What? I didn't say that. And what do you about that kind of-- Megan? Megan. [water sputtering] [water sputtering] [sighs] Damn. [knocking on door] All right.

Unless-- [chuckles] Well, I'll see you tonight at-- at 8:00. You bet. OK. - He likes you. - How do you know that? He was jealous. That's ridiculous. You think? I know. You did this? Hallie helped me. She's an architect. She and Dad are really good friends. We are, huh? He goes over there all the time. Well, it's just this leakypipe business here, you know. I mean, she just won't deal with it. Goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight. [kisses] [metal clanking] Well, I know what we need. I should get going. STEVE MARRIS: Come on. Goodbye. STEVE MARRIS: Goodbye. God.

He's turning it into a bit of a career, though. So he can see you? No. I think he's still hooked on his ex-wife. Although, I get the feeling it isn't mutual. He's a bit of a lost soul. [kissing] I like you a lot. Me, too. Will you call me tomorrow? Mhm. [kisses] [water sputtering] You've got to be kidding me. Come on. Come on! Wait here. Just-- just wait here. I'll be right back. [motor running] [accelerating] Well, who turned this off? I don't know. I hired a new cleaning lady. I told her I had a plumbing problem. Maybe she misunderstood. What is she, a weightlifterin her spare time? [grunts] [shouts] Turn it off! Turn it off! Turn it off. Whew. OK. There. Fixed. Goodnight. - Wait. Look at this mess. Hey, hey, hey, where you going? Home. Why? Because I don't live here. Because it's too easy for usto jump into bed and think we're solving our problems. I-- I'm not trying to solve anything. I mean, I love you, and I want to be with you. It's that simple. Not for me, it isn't. [music playing] [starts ignition] Which version were you working with? The October 16th. Uh, Jordy, it's the wrong version. We ran another spreadsheet last night. Where the hell were you? OK, the printers won't give us the drawings unless he gets a check. Can we cover it? Is it looking any better? Well, maybe. I don't know. [SARCASTIC] Great. Tomorrow's the day. I do know that. You know, I was up till 4 o'clock in the morning working on it. We're not ready. Let's call Barr, try to postpone. Postpone? How do you think that's gonna look? You OK? [sighs] Sandy, uh, told me last night that he doesn't want to have any more children. He knew how I felt. So hewanted to be up front about it. Well, thank God he let you know now. Well, we're still getting married. Why? The whole point was to have a family. Yeah, And I'll be stepmotherto his two children. That's not what you wanted. You wanted to have babies.You want-- Don't tell me what I want. I get a lot from Sandy, more than enough.

Do you like hockey? Not particularly. 'Cause Detroit's in town. And I've got a coupletickets for tomorrow night. I'm going out with my partner, Donnalee. She just broke up with her boyfriend. She needs a little cheering up. Well, she can come, too. To a hockey game? Well, how can you not like hockey? I mean, you know, it's like hating "Lassie." Steve, I spilled a Martini on the floor. I'm dying to go in and lick it up. OK, OK, fine, fine. You and Donnalee, any time. OK? I'll ask her, but no hockey. Can I go now? OK. Tomorrow, tomorrow. So how'd it go? [claps] We're gonna double-date. Double-dates are cool. Yeah, yeah, with Todd andher, uh, business partner. Oh, um, she's not too crazy about hockey. What else is there? Let me think about that. [snaps] Good. [piano music] So what happens now? Well, we've got a lot ofsmaller projects on the go. I think we'll survive. I'm sure you will. And you? Uh, my wife and I are getting divorced. Oh, I'm sorry. No, it's been in the air for a while. I mean, we like each other. We always had fun. But there's just not much there anymore. And kids? No, kids are about sacrifice. We were way too selfish. And now for my other news. Ah, yes, the shoes. There were many theories. Such as? That you arrived barefoot and concocted this whole story to cover upyour tryst with Rodney Philpot. Lies, lies, lies. [laughs] I don't believe it. You had them? I found them by the gazebo. I didn't know where you were. I was gonna call you the next day, but-- [SKEPTICAL] Uh-huh, but you forgot. And then when you remembered,you were too ashamed. Is that where you were? With Rodney Philpot? Yes. [laughs] And you? I went home alone. Greg Cavanaugh does not go home alone from a graduation party. This Greg Cavanaugh did. This is so amazing. It's like I just saw you yesterday. You know, nothing has changed. Is it the same for you? - No. Better. I'm not so shy. [CHUCKLING] Shy? Yeah. So when do you go back? I'm not sure. I'm leaving my job at [inaudible].. It's gonna get very awkward. Her father is a VP there. It's where my wife and I met. Oh, I see. So you married the boss's daughter, huh? [laughs] Do you want to get together tomorrow? I can't. No, it's not a date or anything. It's a-- just friends. I'm staying at the Four Seasons. Call if you want-- I do want. [gentle kisses] [chuckling] Here are part of myB-52's '60s retro ensemble. Aren't they fabulous? They are so hideous. [laughter] And he kept them. That's so-- I don't know. What is that? Well, you don't keep shoesthat long just for a souvenir. Hat maybe. Not shoes. Way too personal. I'll tell you what it is. He just needs a shoulder to cry on. [car horn] DONNALEE CRAWFORD: Hurrt.We're gonna be late. Hi. That's what you're wearing? Well, knowing Steve, we'll probably be playing flag football. [playing classical music] [WHISPERING] I'm justgonna go to the washroom. [WHISPERING] I'm just gonna make sure she knows where it is. It's good, huh? Caring, moving. Yeah. [laughing] God, that was awful. Yes, that was awful. Quite. What were we doing there? Ah, look, it was Steve's idea, you know? He thinks that's what Hallie likes. Uh, wrong. Wrong. [SARCASTIC] Way to go, Steve. What? You are very attractive. Just thought I'd tell you that. [kisses] There was just a little spotthere that needed kissing. Yeah. [music playing] [music playing] What is going on here? I don't know. No, I-- I don't normally do this.- Of course. I just broke up with a guy. I understand. [kissing] Well, maybe she wasn't feeling well and he just drove her home. That's not like her. She'd call. Maybe they just wanted to be alone. Hey, um, you know, I've onlybasically been with one woman my whole life. I really don't have much experience. So-- so I miss a lot. Well, like the first timeI came over to your house, you remember? And you cooked this big dinner. It never occurred to me that-- Oh, Steve. --maybe you were thinkingabout something else. Anyway, you and I are notexactly the same type. I know that. But I was thinking that it mightbe nice if we were to spend a little more time together. We spend a lot of time together. Every time I turn on the tap, you come over. I know. But I meant, you know, to, like-- to go out on a date sort of thing. You just broke up with your wife. You need more time. You need time for things to settle. Oh, no, no, it's settled. Yeah, whew, finally. She's seeing someone else. I'm sorry. No, no, that's OK. Well, you were right. I wasn't right. Anyway, the point is I like you. You're very sweet. But you're right, we're not the same types. And-- Now you're seeing somebody else? Someone from college. We bumped into each other,and we just kind of clicked. So why didn't you just say so? Sorry. [autodialing] [dial tone] DONNALEE CRAWFORD [ON PHONE]: Hello? So where were you? DONNALEE CRAWFORD [ON PHONE]: Um, well, you're not gonna believe this, but Todd and I kind of hit it off. - What? I don't know. [LAUGHING]Maybe it was the music? So why didn't you tell me? Hello. It's-- it's Todd. Um, thanks. [laughter] [kissing] Mr. Cavanaugh's room, please. - HOTEL CLERK [ON PHONE]: I'm sorry, ma'am, Mr. Cavanaugh checked out.- When? HOTEL CLERK [ON PHONE]: I have no way of telling you that, ma'am. Thank you. [doorbell ringing] Not now, Steve. Greg. Hi. I just called the hotel.They said you-- I was halfway to the airport. But you said that-- I didn't have the nerve to call you. That's why I-- I decided to go home. I don't understand. That's why I never calledyou about the damn shoes. I didn't forget. I was scared. Of what? Of you. That's why I never asked you out. What if you shot me down? Why would I shoot you down? Because you wereHallie, the one and only. No one's original at that age. Nobody has the guts. But you were. And I was this lunkhead jock wandering around. Why would you have anything to do with me? Greg, you were the best-looking boy in the universe. [QUIET] Yeah. But why didn't you like me? I was crazy about you. [music playing] [kissing] I know this is crazy. You're not gonna give meyour school ring, are you? My wife has it. Ex-wife. Hallie, I just want to spend time with you, you know, hang out, date, see what happens. Do you want to do that? Yes. Of course I would. Well, in school, he waslike a statue on a pedestal. But in real life, he's so much better-- vulnerable, like therest of us, and gorgeous. Did I say gorgeous? Once or twice. What else? He laughs a lot, at himself. Very few men know how to do that. How passionate? I don't know. We haven't slept together yet. This is interesting. How come? I don't know. We're just taking things slowly. That's allowed. You used to recommend that. Come on. What? What is it? He doesn't work. Well, not anymore. You mean he's rich? Gee, good for him. Well, what do you do if you don't work? Hunt foxes? Listen to you, Hallie the Calvinist. No, no, just working middle class. [knocking] Your bank manager is coming by here tomorrow at 9:00 AM. And these are the projectswe have on the go. I've flagged the ones that are, uh-- Real? Yeah. Hey, Jordy, don't worry. We're gonna be fine. [fire crackling] Did you take all these? No. I kept bumping into people from back then. We'd dig out the old pictures, and I'd take the ones they didn't want. HALLIE MITCHELL: Why? [laughs] I don't know. Good memories, I guess. I liked being 19. Well, you were good at it. I couldn't wait to get outof there, start my real life. Speaking of which, I've got to do some damage control at the bank tomorrow. What's the problem? We blew our line of crediton the Dunvegan project. Time for a spanking. You need money? We're fine. - I thought that was over?- It is. But we'll be OK. We just need to pay downthe line of credit by half. Half? That's $40,000. Exactly. Everything will be back in balance. When is this money due? There's no rush, not with you two. How about 30 days? $40,000 in one month. Hi. How'd it go? [UNENTHUSED] Great. Yeah, I can see Did you, uh-- did you tell her? Well, no. No? - Because I was waiting for you.- Oh. Well, I'm here now. [kisses] Um, we're getting married. Oh. TODD STANFFORD: And? And-- We're pregnant. Oh, honey. [kisses] Oh. [laughing] So how much do they want back? $40,000. Listen, why don't you let me loan it to you? Interest-free, you pay me back when you can. Why? - No. I don't want to mix businesswith my personal life. Well, then I'll lend it to you personally. It's the same thing. I don't want to owe you money, Greg. Well, then forget about the money. You don't have to pay me back.It doesn't matter. It matters to me. Some of us have to work for our money. Listen, I busted my butt for every cent I ever made, all right? This isn't about money. This is-- this is about trust, you know? You-- you don't trust me. [FRUSTRATED] That's for my half, plus tip. [motor stops] Hi. Hey. Looks like you fixed it. Well, it wasn't me. I, uh, called the city. They said it was a blockeddrain, and they snaked it out. That's great about Todd and Donnalee, huh? Yeah, yeah, having a baby. Good for them. Say hi to Megan for me. Will do. Say, Hallie. Yeah? How's it, uh, going with that guy? Good. [opens door] [music playing] [phone ringing] Hello? GREG CAVANAUGH [ON PHONE]:Hallie, it's-- it's Greg. I'm coming over. Yeah, come on over. When I first came back to see you, I wasn't really expecting anything. It was just a fantasy. But it's not. You're everything I remember and more. You're more beautiful now. You're more sure of yourself. I know what I want, Hallie. What about you? What are you afraid of? I don't know. [knocking on door] Yeah? Hey. Hey, come on in. OK. I got the lawn back together there, finally. Um, you know, I was gonna lay down some sod. But I'm thinking maybe I'll just wait till spring, plant some grass. Grass is always better. Yeah, yeah, that's what I think. Oh, by the way, Megan got an A on her project. And she's pretty proud of it. Well, you should, you know, come by and check it out when you get a second. HALLIE MITCHELL: I'd love to. OK. Hallie? Hi. Hi. The door was open. Hi. Uh, Steve, this is Greg. Hey. Hey. Oh, the neighbor, yeah. Yeah, I heard a lot about you. Actually, I'm on my way out here. So I'll-- but it's nice meeting you. Yeah, you, too. OK. Bagels? What? I talked my bank this morning. no, Hallie, listen to me. It's bridge financing. It's not a yoke around your neck. At least talk to your partner. But there is one condition. What? As soon as you can, you take a break. No new jobs. And do what? You and me in Paris. Mhm? And then the south of France,first class all the way. Think you could handle that? I could try. Whew! Yeah! 40 grand. We're saved, or-- you know, I'm saved. [chuckling] HALLIE MITCHELL: It's amazing how easy it is to get money when you already have it or know somebody who does. If it bothers you, why'd you ask him? I didn't ask him. He offered. And then he turned it intothis big issue of trust. But if you trust him,Hallie, what's the problem? Well, now I feel obligated. Now he wants me to go to Paris with him, first class all the way. [SARCASTIC] Oh, dear. Do you love him? That's what you asked me about Sandy. Maybe I've never been in love before. How am I supposed to know? Maybe I'm just afraid. I don't know. Take the trip to Paris. Figure it out there. [phone ringing] [clears throat] Hello? Oh, hi. Mhm. Sure, I'll tell him. Bye. She's got no water pressure. [groans] [sighs] Well, you know what? I'm not going to start diggingagain unless we go all the way to the city line this time. OK, I'll call someone tomorrow. I mean, we're gonna need a backhoe now and a couple of guys. Yeah, well-- Hey, wait. Can I show you something? STEVE MARRIS: Yeah. OK. It's built around the ideaof the public square, piazza. This is a fountain. And each of the unitshas a view of the square, but they're still open to thecity through these arches. Well it's a town. You're building a town. Small town for a small town boy. This is what he wanted. I know it. So tell him. It's too late. How can it be too late if it's the right thing? Hallie, this is fantastic. Well, it's a way of living in the city without, uh-- without being lost. The economics are ridiculous. It doesn't matter. He's got to see this. Man, I'd live there. [music playing] [phone ringing] Hello? Can you meet me at the office? I want to show you something. It's 3:00 AM. About a half an hour? OK. What's going on? Jordy, we need this printed and copied. You need Hallie printed and copied? [sighs] BARR'S SECRETARY: There wasa process, Ms. Mitchell. HALLIE MITCHELL: Well,if I could just see him-- BARR'S SECRETARY: If you'd liketo drop off your material-- Is anyone gonna look at it? HALLIE MITCHELL: I doubt it. Your card wouldn't tilt. I had to use mine. What? I could go to his house. It's gated. You'll never get it to him. I know. [music playing] Mr. Barr. Mr. Barr. Look out! [crashing] Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you all right? I'm sorry. Are you OK? [groaning] HALLIE MITCHELL: Hallie Mitchell. I'm sorry. I tried to call your office, but I-- I'm sorry. What do you want? Oh, just-- just look. Just have a look. Hallie, the process is over. You had your chance. Is it over because you got what you wanted, or is it over because you're giving up? What is it? It's a town. It's a small town. - Give me the pack. - Hm? [IMPATIENT] The pack. Uh, that's not mine. So then he falls off his bike. And I think I've killed him. And the next thing I'mthinking is, I'm gonna be dragged off to prison for this. A faint heart never won a fair contract. Well, do you think thathe'll even look at our stuff? His office called. He must be interested. Well, when's he gonna make the big decision? Pretty soon, I hope. Where's my bag? That's two or three years. What about Paris? Well, this contract ismore important than Paris. We'll go later. It's more important than me. That's not fair. I can't separate myself from my work. Hallie, I have enough money for the both of us for the rest of our lives. It's not about money. I love what I do. I-- You know, none of this wouldbe a problem if you loved me. But you don't, do you? I don't know. Um, I'll Call the bank. That's all right. I'm sure you'll pay me back. I love you, Hallie. [music playing] [pipes creaking] Find the pipe, that's all I said. [IMPATIENT] So why'd they turn the water off? They didn't turn the water off. There must be a leak. [grunts] [shouts] Turn it off! Turn it off! Turn it off! I can't turn it off. I broke the damn thing. What is it? What's wrong? I broke up with Greg. I'm sorry. What happened? He wanted to marry me andtake me to Paris, first class all the way. That son of a bitch. All he wanted me to do was love him. Why can't I do that? What's the matter with me? I just-- [crying] Here. There. Well, the water department's here. There's definitely only one pipe. I suggest you call a lawyer. [light chuckle] Yeah. You know what's gonna happen to me? Hm? I'm gonna flop as an architect. I'm gonna become old and bitter and die alone in a house full of mangy cats. Why are you so hard on yourself? My gosh, I mean, you've got brains and looks. And everything you touch turns into something beautiful and graceful, like you. Wow. Where did that come from? Just stop beating yourself up, OK? You're gonna be fine. Promise? I promise. Steve. Hm? I don't even have a datefor Donnalee's wedding. Yeah, neither do I. You're on. HALLIE MITCHELL: Steve Yeah? You're a very nice man. Goodnight, Hallie. [flips light switch] Steve. [pleasant music] PRIEST: Let us begin. [interposing voices] DONNALEE CRAWFORD: Come on. What's going on? I don't know. Does he? I doubt it. I'm very scared. Why? Because I think I love him. I mean, I think I really, really love him. [sighs] You sure? Well, I have a fever. And my hands are shaking. And I'm freezing. And my stomach is upset. And I just want to be with him. What is that? [kisses] [laughter] [sighs] You're gonna freeze out here. Here. Thanks. [music playing] [chimes playing] [glass breaking] [phone ringing] [kissing] Uh, it's Marylynn. She got the number from Megan.

OK? Yeah. [beep] Um, she caught Kipscrewing around on her. She's hysterical. I'll be back as soon as she calms down, OK? I promise. [kisses] [opens and closes door] [birds chirping] Hallie. She's the only woman I'veknown since I was 18. I guess it's just hard for me to stop caring. Is that what this is? I told her no more. Till the next time. I don't know. Maybe. It's too risky for me. It's just not meant to be. [clears throat] [closes door] [water sputtering] [crying] [knocking on door] We can't shower at the same time, unless we use the same shower. Now, wait a minute. Now, I know I've got some stuffto iron out with Marylynn. I know that. But I don't love her. I love you. Only you. You're not my type. I know. I love you, too. I know. [kissing] [jazz music] [shower running] At this ceremonial groundbreaking, we celebrate a new vision. A city whose structures arenot merely ugly, little boxes, but structures that are more like small towns and neighborhoods that arenurturing to its residents and to our community,not unlike the small town that I grew up in and, Iguess, never really left. On a personal note, I look forward to being at home here myself, if I can get in. [laughter] And I'd like to offer my congratulations, my respect, and my thanks to two very courageous and visionary women. JORDY RANDALL: Yeah, that's right DONNALEE CRAWFORD: All right. Thanks. Oh. [inaudible] Ready? Yep. [cheering] [applause] [jazz music]
