A HOU HSIAO-HSIEN FILM FROM THE 1892 DIALECT NOVEL BY HAN ZIYUN AS TRANSLATED INTO MANDARIN BY EILEEN CHANG The most elite pleasure quarters in late 19th century Shanghai... ...lay hidden in the city's British Concession These enclaves were known as “Flower Houses” “All Fortunes! 3 Great Fortunes!” Why do I keep losing today? If you lose, you have to drink! I won't accept defeat! What? Empty your cup! “All Fortunes! 2 Together! 5 Champions!” “5 Champions!” It's a tie! Neither of you won Then they should both drain their cups! It would be fair for both of you all have to drink Good! Everybody, drink! This is very enjoyable! Who's next? Who's next? Me All right, Luo! Let's use the chicken-pattern cups Yum... “2 Together!" "8 Immortals!” “2 Together! 3 Great Fortunes!” “3 Great Fortunes!” Drink up! My young brother Yufu is new here, but look how many girls will drink for him! Impressive! “2 Together!" “ An easy win! 5 Champions!” All right. . .“8 Immortals!” “8 Immortals!” Pour wine for him Your brother's rather good at this game He's learned from experts! “2 Together!" 4 Joys! 2 Together!” “3 Great Fortunes! 8 Immortals!” “4 Joys!” Pour wine for him You have to drink! Please, not too much! Young people always have a way! Yufu, who's she? Crystal's younger sister Don't you know? Crystal is always feeling ill Her sister is here in her place Thank you, miss We should let Yufu go We can go on playing The women all think he should stop because Crystal's is waiting for him Have some more wine! Come on, drink up! He and Crystal are really serious about each other! I've seen besotted couples in my time... But none like them! It's as if they're stuck together like toffee! Sticking with each other. They go out together, come in together If a day goes by without a meeting, it's the end of the world! Crystal asks the women to track him everywhere And if they lose him? Then she bursts into tears! I tell you, I've never seen the like! That's what love is all about, isn't it? What happens when they're together? I'll tell you! I visited him one morning... ...and found them gazing into each other's eyes Just sitting there, gazing at each other! Not saying anything? Not a word! Hopelessly lovestruck! You know what that's called? What? Tell us! “Mental telepathy”! Let's drink! Fate has brought them together Luo calls it "fate"... I believe in it! Really? I call it 'bad karma' What? Notice how pale Yufu is? He's caught in her trap! He looks so pale, doesn't he? One time I suggested a visit to the opera You know what Crystal said? What? “The opera's just a lot of noise. Why go?” But the opera is a blast! So I suggested to go out in a horse-carriage instead I thought they'd enjoy looking around You know what Crystal said? “Who wants to bump around in a horse-carriage?” Again, a horse-carriage trip is a blast! And it didn't even end there! My next suggestion was to go and be photographed Nice idea For a souvenir! You know what Crystal said? “But the camera will capture the beams from your eyes!" Next morning I saw her licking his eyes! Licking his eyes? With her tongue! Actually licking his eyes! This has been going on for half a month or more! What a story! Let's have some more wine! And the food's getting cold Your next dish! What is it? A delicacy! Bean-curd soup! Bean-curd soup in a sand pot What's wrong with Master Wang? Master Wang has been calling on Jasmin And so today Crimson sent her maids to beat Jasmin at the Ming Garden I didn't know Crimson was so vicious! That wasn't vicious! I think she was silly to go to so much trouble If they'd damaged her jewelry, Master Wang would have paid for it anyway And if you'd been Crimson? Me? I'm not inclined to tell you They're quarrelling! Why don't you call on Cinnamon and see how I react? You think I wouldn't dare? I'd have Cinnamon come out to give you a beating! It sounds nicer than it is. You're saying this to impress Master Hong? All of your talk is ridiculous Why? As a flower girl, you have many callers So you must accept that your callers will see other flower girls! What do you mean? It's simple enough We're in business, so there's no other way If you buy my exclusive services for three seasons, then I'll see no-one else Isn't that right ? You mean you want to leech off me? If not you, then who else ? Right? Drink! Drink! Master Zhu, I challenge you! This is what I call a party! FLOWERS OF SHANGHAI Crimson, of the Huifang Enclave Master Wang, it was your mistake You should be frank with our mistress It's nothing even you called on ten Jasmin It's no right to hide from her When Crimson found out, she wailed... “Master Wang has abandoned me for Jasmin!” Master Wang simply called on Jasmin for a cup of wine last night And now he's here, as usual Master Hong! Don't blame our mistress for being upset! When Master Wang began calling on her... ...she had many other callers But they stopped coming... ...when Master Wang became her patron We invited them back, but Master Wang said... “Never mind if they come or not, I'll support you myself!" Master Wang... Those were your exact words! Our mistress has been very contented with Master Wang She takes no other gentlemen callers You also said... You'd take care of all our mistress's debts Master Hong... How can you blame our mistress for being upset? There's nothing more to say about this Put Jasmin out of your mind Master Wang is here now Crimson, you have not lost face Let's put this behind us Master Wang will buy you clothes and jewelry And he'll clear whatever debts you have That settles everything, doesn't it? I don't mind him calling on Jasmin What I mind is the secrecy! And he's with her almost all the time! Master Tang, I've been with Master Wang for four to five years ...and what you see in this room is all that he's ever given me He's been calling on Jasmin for only ten days... ...and she has already has an entire new wardrobe Seeing what's going on, his friends have rushed to buy furniture for her Master Tang, you have no idea! This is nonsense! Flower girls are recompensed for their services Their callers have no responsibility for their other debts You're asking too much! No flower girl relies on just one caller And no gentleman limits himself to one flower girl We can go wherever we please! It's tedious to even discuss this! You're right, Master Hong No flower girl relies on just one caller Our mistress has plenty of other callers Why should she rely only on Master Wang? But Master Wang made her a promise If he'd kept his promise, our mistress would have no complaint As you say, no gentleman has to limit himself to one flower girl Our mistress can say nothing But while he is calling on Jasmin our debts remain unpaid Consider, Master Wang... ...which of us is being “tedious”? You or our mistress? All right None of this properly concerns us Let's go Are you leaving now, Master Wang? Jingda! Master Wang, you can leave if you want to No-one will detain you But let's make one thing clear Jingda and I were up all night comforting our mistress We didn't sleep at all Tonight we will sleep Women like us are never responsible... ...if our luck turns bad and we are left penniless Master Wang... You cannot blame us for this situation We should leave now Stay as long as you like I'm sorry you were troubled Tomorrow we'll set two banquet tables to apologize to you No need for that You were too scared of us to come alone? Did you think I will bully you? You turn up today with two friends For what reason? What they said just made me angrier! Very clever of you! Master Wang is not at fault Those friends led him astray Maybe they were the ones who led him to call on Jasmin He needed no help! His friends didn't push him He found that little chicken all by himself! Jasmin is no chicken these days She even hires opera troupes for entertainment! Master Wang... How much have you spent on her? Thousands? Nonsense Really? Well, Master Wang needn't bother his head about it Smoke some opium Ginseng soup for you, Master Wang Azhu, why is Crimson so upset? What do you mean? I've promised to pay her debts, but she still says I'm cheating her Master Wang understands very well No, that's why I'm asking Master Wang, an intelligent man like you should understand Our mistress has always treated you well Why didn't you clear her debts before now? Now you say you'll clear them But you sound grudging How can she accept if you begrudge her for holding you to your promise? But she's the one holding a grudge! Our mistress has nothing to be angry about Sooner or later, Master Wang will clear her debts for her for her It's all up to you But should your relationship with Crimson depend on such trivial details? Well, should it? If I don't clear her debts, she calls me bad And if I clear them, she still calls me bad What does she really want? Master Wang, do I really need to explain? Don't get angry... Just don't get angry, all right? I'll follow your advice All you can say is “Don't get angry”? If you were me, wouldn't you get angry? If I were you, I'd be over it by morning Don't get angry... Don't cry. Come on. Don't cry. Pearl, of the Gongyang Enclave Master Hong is here Where were you last night? I called on Jasmin, then went home Why is your mother hitting Treasure? It's nothing Treasure should mind what she says She wants more than she can have Alongside Jade, she's nothing There's always trouble when she tries to compete What did Treasure say? Treasure said... “Jade doesn't have her own hookah, so Auntie took mine for her” “She goes out in my old dresses, too” Jade overheard this, and refused to wear the dress again This morning she stayed in bed, saying she felt ill. That's why Mother is scolding Treasure She's asked me to talk to Jade What are you supposed to say to her? It's difficult for me Just seeing her makes me angry She gets a few bookings and she's so full of herself While Treasure gets beaten, as if she'd only just entered the house But Jade is a real asset If you weren't the daughter of the house, she might look down on you too Don't say that, she and I are quite close She pays more attention to me than to Mother A booking for Mistress Jade Coming I just told her... If she refused to go, then your mother would have to send Treasure instead She rushed off the moment she heard that Well done! Eat something. You should eat before we go out And you should eat before you go drinking Not hungry, and I should go now Then send for me later. I'll eat,have a wash and join you All right Mistress Pearl, food's ready Ask Jade if she's hungry, we could eat together Sister. Feeling better? Better. Have some more Treasure opens her mouth without thinking without thinking She says whatever comes into her head Anyway, you're not like her You get many bookings, Mother likes you You needn't be so sensitive If Treasure upsets you, tell me - don't tell Mother Does it seem like I'm taking Treasure's side? I'm not really After all, we're just flower girls All working in this one house Some years from now, we'll all be married Even the most popular of flower girls... ...has only a fleeting period of fame Try to look at it that way Sister, you think too much I'm too ignorant to know what's true and what isn't I'll never blame you for setting me right I just hope you really understand Let's eat. Emerald, of the Shangren Enclave Do you have any money? Yes. Just look at you, at your age! You still want to keep lovers? Don't care about face? Here's some spending money for them I won't. I'm tired of reminding you. Who else can you borrow from? Don't worry, this is the last time Thank you, Master Luo, this is so embarrassing At least you realize that Why does she need the money? She irritates me so much, look at her... When she has money, her men take it When she doesn't, she borrows from me Scold her about it, and she pretends not to understand A few days later she's forgotten all about it A booking for Mistress Emerald! What can I do about her? Where is it? Houma Street All right Who is she seeing? There are several men Some new, as well as the old ones Carrying on like that at her age! I saw an old man In the outer room. Is he one of them? That's her tailor, Zhang. How could he be her lover? That money was to pay his bill Where in Houma Street? The Qian residence again It's a mahjong party, they'll want me to play for someone If no-one else books me, I'll be stuck there Sometimes I just sit for two or three hours it's such a bore Then why not turn them down? I can't refuse a booking, Auntie would be furious She'd scold you? Definitely If I do nothing wrong, she never says a word But one small mistake and I never hear the end of it Make yourself comfortable, I'll be back as soon as I can - All right Sister. What is it? Look Your Auntie beat you again I've told you, learn how to flatter! If you won't listen to me, you'll get beaten But my Auntie isn't like yours She beats me whether I flatter Or not One man called on me several times, and I was accused of flattering him too much Didn't you follow my advice? I said exactly what you told me to say “If you want me to entertain callers, don't beat me!” That made her lock me in and tie me to the bed She asked me if I dared to refuse a booking So tell her you do, and let them beat you I couldn't stand the pain I had to give in to her to get away If you're afraid of pain, you should be an official's wife or daughter, not a flower girl Is there any opium? There's a vat over there How can anyone swallow it? It's so bitter! Some people take it raw, it must ruin their stomachs! So painful! You're so stupid! I don't think she'll ever learn You know, last month Master Chen... ...threw a banquet for her But that was one whole month ago Then she had a caller who ordered some food and wine for her But he turned out to be an old friend of hers, a freeloader! The clerk from the foreign goods store He came after dinner and stayed past midnight! You see why Third Sister beats her? No tips from serving wine, and no outside bookings? That one banquet was the lot! No more in prospect So her total earning for the month was one foreign dollar! You expect your Auntie to live on the north-west wind? Well, do you? You want to have outside affairs and treat non-paying callers? You're wasting your breath You're useless! You deserve to be beaten to death! Otherwise you'll go on losing money! Stop it Get her out, she makes me so angry! Where is all this bad luck coming from? Jasmin, of the East Hexing Enclave 16 foreign dollars is too much? Too much. Ten is about right Give him ten, or 12 at most The best-value emeralds are in Temple Market Then I'll trouble Master Hong for the emerald jewelry That's fine with me Qiao! Coming... Bring hot towels, clear the table Yes You have some too I don't want to It's addictive, I won't be able to work! It's not addictive Crimson smokes it, and she's no addict Crimson has many callers, why should she care? Even if she gets addicted, she'll be fine Actually, she has very few callers now How do you know? I saw the books Aside from me, she's had only 20 or 30 bookings, all from old callers That's enough, considering that she has you You don't understand She supports her whole family, she needs a lot How much do they need if the whole family shares one small room? Unless she spends a lot on herself She doesn't spend much Nhe takes a horse carriage every few days That's not so expensive So where does the money go? How should I know? You suggested she spends a lot! Tell me what she spends it on I have no idea how Crimson spends money Don't call on her and tell her I said this If you do, she'll think I'm talking behind her back Don't worry, I won't say anything You and Crimson have been together for three or four years now What can I tell you about her that you don't know? You're so naive).! Crimson is always vilifying you And here you are, helping to cover up her problems! When I began calling on Crimson, she told me “A really good gentleman caller is every flower girl's dream" “Now that we have met, I need no other caller" I told her she could stop being a flower girl and marry me if she wanted And she was quick to agree But she was just humoring me She said we could marry if I paid all her debts So I paid them, and then she said her parents didn't approve of the match Master Wang is kind to come when he's asked to It proves our banquet table still has legs! Mistress, you have me to thank It seems she doesn't want to marry me I can't tell what she's thinking Master Wang, please smoke It's such a trial for you to come here! Not one of our stupid servants prepares your pipe for you I don't need anyone to Have some tea, Master Wang The jeweler gave you this to look at? Yes, 16 foreign dollars for a hairpin! It must be cheaper at Temple Market You already have hairpins like this You can buy them for someone else, why can't I buy a pair for myself? Of course you can, but you already have several pairs You could buy something else I will buy something else Frankly, I don't need another hairpin But I'm angry, so I want to buy a pair... just to waste 16 more of your foreign dollars Then take 16 foreign dollars and buy something else! There's nothing special about these hairpins Nothing special about me either, so they suit me You're not serious! Mistress Crimson is known throughout Shanghai! Am I still a mistress? I'm less than a wild chicken! I can't be called “Mistress” Sister, Jade and I must have been enemies in a previous lifetime! We've just quarrelled again! She's still saying bad things about me I can't stand it She wasn't talking about you Of course she was! That's why Auntie threw me out! All right, I give in I'll never say another word when we're in Auntie's room Satisfied? What is the matter with you two? Stop it! Treasure, go to your room Jade, sit over here I've told you many times not to argue with her You know she isn't too bright Pearl... Master Hong Luo has set a banquet table in Emerald's rooms Let's go there later All right. Jade, please leave us Honest flower girls are so devious these days! You all drink together, you must know what I mean Which girl are you talking about? You all sit around a table drinking... But Young Master Zhu slips an emerald pendant to Jade under the table And then Jade asks me not to tell you So why are you telling me now? I advised her to tell you! I said it would make you more eager to help... ...if she ever needs a favor Jade is doing very well now So maybe it's time she got married You can be her match-maker You can do It... I'll help you. Master Hong, your invitation Mistress, Master Wang is here Mistress... I heard! Am I wrong to call you? You have no callers and you're brimming with jealousy Don't you want to eat, Mistress? Azhu... We haven't eaten either. Order some dishes, we can eat together But you've been drinking, you must have eaten We really haven't Mistress, shall I order for you too? I don't want to eat Master Wang, if you're hungry, order for yourself Mistress hasn't even had a sip of tea... I'll get her some congee later Liang, bring some tea Master Hong I'll leave first Master Hong, are you going? Bye. What's wrong with you? Nothing! I want to talk to you. Come over here If you want to talk, then talk I don't want to see you unhappy all day Every time I come, you're unhappy You know how upsetting it is to see you like this? Don't be like this, if only for my sake I'm unhappy, that's a fact! What do you want me to do? If you don't like it, go somewhere that you can be happy! I'm being patient with you, and you're so rude to me... I said nothing when you came Not a word to offend you. And all you say is that I look unhappy Now you say I'm being rude I think you're the one who's being insensitive How can I be happy? I see, it's always my fault If I behave like this again, you might as well beat me But don't be like this Come here, I have something to discuss with you Thank you. Ham congee Don't wait for me Master Ge, time for a drinking game Let's play “2 Together, 2 Together" “2 Together, “5 Champions” '4 Joys, 4 Joys' “2 Together, 4 Joys" You lost! Have something to eat! Let's play again Come on, now “2 Together" "2 Together, 4 Joys!” "2 Together, 5 Champions!” "5 Champions!” Drink up! Your next dish... Good! Mistress Pearl and Mistress Jade from Gongyang Enclave are here Spring rolls, bring more spring rolls Master Wang, please eat more! Jade, Young Master Zhu is asking for you Shuren! Please... Who is that? Shuren - he's Zhu Airen's nephew I'm taking him here for fun. Master Hong, have a game with me All right, come on You two are well matched I'm not so sure about that Here's the wine “2 Together" "2 Together, 5 Champions!” Got you! I lost A rare occurrence! Shut-en. Shuren, let's play I don't know how. What is there to know? Come on...good “All Fortunes!" "8 Immortals!”1 Win!" “ An easy win! 2 Together" “3 Great Fortunes! 1 Win!" Lost again! Shuren... Come on, one more time “All Fortunes!” “1 Win! 1 Win!" '1 WI"! Drink up Once again! “5 Champions! 2 Together" “5 Champions! 1 Win!” Lost again! Master Luo lost two in a row! Not in form tonight! Come on, come on... One more time He can't bear to lose, play once more “All Fortunes!" "3 Big Fortunes! 3 Big Fortunes!” Let me drink for him Sorry, I've spilt it Never mind, wipe it up What's that? Take a look, Master Luo... You know what it shows? Yes, it's the 'wine rack' (a scene from Golden Lotus) Don't discuss it with him! He's immoral! You're wrong, it's not the 'wine rack'! What's amusing all of you? Put that away or you'll be scolded Master Luo... Did Emerald tell you she wants to buy her freedom? Yes, but it seems she can't Not really. No girl who wants to buy her freedom announces the fact She announces it when she has it I'm okay with it. Frankly, what I want is the business she brings, not her person If I don't let her go, she'll be in no mood for business So I may as well let her go So why did she tell me she can't do it? I wouldn't want to criticise her, but... As you know, Emerald is a mischievous girl In this business, I buy in girls when they are seven or eight And I bring them up until they're old enough to work I pay for their food and clothes, I teach them everything But not all of them make the grade as flower girls Emerald is clever, and she's helped a lot And now she wanted her freedom, She recalls that I originally paid 100 dollars for her Now, ten times 100 is only one thousand dollars Master Luo, really... There's no comparison between the original price and her value now! So she says one thousand. What do you say? I'm guided by my conscience Go to the teahouse and see what other people think about this Her bookings alone amount to one thousand dollars per season Not counting her tips or the gifts she receives Master Luo, even if you paid me three thousand dollars... . it would balance only one year's earnings And she could still earn a lot as a flower girl Isn't that so, Master Luo? Look at Silver Phoenix here, for example... Girl! Where is your mind wandering now? Just look at her A girl like Silver Phoenix gets no business Should I pay for her meals? I should pay her 100 dollars and let her go! A Shanghai flower girl can be worth three thousand or one thousand There's no fixed value If you don't ask for too much, I'll make it worth your while We can be partners, and both of us can do well Master Luo is quite right! I'm not demanding three thousand I'm sure that we can come to a satisfactory arrangement You're back! Think it over, Master Luo Is Silver Phoenix asleep? You look dead on your feet! Not at all, I was listening to Auntie Did she really drop off? Auntie hit her... Don't mind her Leave us alone Auntie was discussing the fee for your freedom She wants three thousand I urged her to reduce it And I'll help you with some of it We can sort this out together, it will be fine Who asked you to pay? I have plans of my own, you needn't be involved We'll see All aunties are calculating by nature My Auntie is a self-made woman She bought herself a few girls... We didn't cost her much! Take me, I've been working here for five years She's got nearly twenty thousand, just from me And my dresses and furniture are worth at least ten thousand She'll keep all of it But, she still demands three thousand! Fine, three thousand If she deserves it, she'll get it! Emerald, Master Luo thinks that your value is two thousand dollars He'll pay half of it. Does that seem fair? Give me a light I didn't realize you were so wealthy! You were so wealthy! If I'm worth two thousand, bring me five thousand first Where do you think I'd find so much money? Come, this is no time for false modesty I thought you were serious about this! If my freedom is bought... ...I'll need three thousand for clothes and accessories to start afresh You think one thousand from you will be enough? You want me to starve once I leave this house? So you don't want my help? Of course I welcome your help! Take care of my clothes and accessories... and I'll be grateful for any further help you can give me! Fine. Auntie! Forget what we discussed. Her freedom is no concern of mine Where is your conscience! Just reflect for a moment You were orphaned at seven and came to this flower house I sympathised, and treated you like my own child I combed your hair, bound your feet, everything Now you treat me as an enemy! How did I offend you? You want your freedom so that you can rise above us I wished you success, so that you could reciprocate my favours And now you treat me like this! So young, and yet so cruel You'll come to a bad end! Auntie, do stop crying! What does this matter? I'm in your house, you can decide whether to free me or not I don't want to buy my freedom And if we go on arguing like this, they'll hear us next door I can make no sense of this Ms. Zhao, come and tell me your view. A flower girl wants to buy her freedom. Her patron wants to help If Master Luo had other ideas... ...he could discuss them with me But now you reject his help You want all of his money for yourself! "3 Great Fortunes" "4 Joys!" Let's drink! Let's drink. Losers drink their own penalties All right, agreed That's good Haven't seen you for a long while, Master Ke Take a seat I don't want to see anyone without a cup in his hand! Keep the wine coming! Let me drink with you Let's drink Come on, let's empty these cups Master Zhu is a fine drinker! Let's play the drinking game Come on... Shall we play as a team? Fine, you two together! Master Wang, let's play! Let me beat him first Ready... “All Fortunes!” "5 Champions! All Fortunes! "5 Champions! 2 Together!” "5 Champions!" "5 Champions!" Drink! Come on, your turn. You have to drink! Let's play. Your turn... All Fortunes!” “All Fortunes” “2 Together!” “2 Together!” Drink! He lost! He lost! Empty the cup! Master Luo, you should be drinking too! Come, have something to eat The food is getting cold! This fish is straight from the Huangpu River Very fresh! Come and eat! What's going on outside? What's happening? I don't know, go and see What's going on out there? Something happened! Let's play another round “All Fortunes” “2 Together, 2 Together" 4 Joys!" "2 Together” 4 Joys!" I'll drink It's nothing Drink! What happened? Nothing... It's a mess Drink! They're just checking on gambling in the alley Nothing to worry about Just checking on gambling No need to worry There's been an accident in the alley! What? Someone has taken a bad fall, that's all Someone's had an accident! What? Fell down? Go and see! Someone had a bad fall We should go and see Master Wang, please slow down! You scared me, you could have fallen! Where's the mistress? Downstairs, I think Master Wang, you've drunk too much! Liang, bring a hot towel Master Wang! Master Wang! Master Wang has dozed off Master Wang! Master Wang, what are you doing? Please calm down! Master Wang, don't be angry! Don't be angry, Master Wang! Master Wang! Take care of these matters for me What's it? Congratulations, Jasmin! It's good that you marry Jasmin now But you do still have some obligations to Crimson What obligations? You are Crimson's only caller. She relies on you completely If you don't call, she'll have no-one Bills are served at this time of year, she'll have many expenses Her parents, her brother, they all have to eat What could she do? If you punish her too much, it may kill her You may now consider Crimson's life worthless... But we started out calling on her for pleasure, and it shouldn't now come to this Pleasure shouldn't just turn into vindictiveness You're on their side, are you? Don't be silly, why should I side with them? Then why should I call on her? I warned you when you first called on her that it had no meaning. You didn't listen, and you let the relationship grow Now you're furious with her, and you accuse me of being on her side! What can I say? So why should I call on her? I'm not asking you to call on her again, just put in an appearance! Why? I'm thinking of you! What if something happens to her? They'll be relieved if you just show your face Just to see how they're coping You've been calling on her for four or five years, spending so many foreign dollar You can't leave them facing those small seasonal bills now If you help her settle those bills, she'll survive You need never call on her again if you don't want to Master Wang and Master Hong are here We never expected to see you here again! Our mistress has been so anxious, she'll be so relieved Master Hong The downstairs staff are all worried that Master Wang has turned against our mistress I told them not to speak such nonsense Master Wang was furious, that's the only reason he's been blaming our mistress Deep inside, he knew our mistress wouldn't have an affair with an actor I don't care if there was an affair or not, it's not important Crimson... If Master Wang weren't here, you'd be complaining Now he is here, and you're silent Liang, bring hot towels Azhu, bring hot towel Immediately Mistress, shall I have the table cleared? Jingda, clear the table! I've never seen you so angry in all the years I've known you A prosperous flower girl might have an affair with an opera actor But am I prosperous? How could you imagine I was having an affair? You could torture me to death with accusations But I'd die with a clear conscience If you say you didn't, then you didn't. It doesn't matter My parents gave me this body But everything else in these rooms came from your generosity Even if you broke all of it, it wouldn't matter If you want to abandon me, my only option will be death but to hell.

You are capable in business, widely respected But you should choose better male friends This is my last word on this subject Have more respect for yourself, you're over 50 Don't make a fool of yourself with young men If you buy a new flower girl for one thousand... for one thousand... ...you won't need to buy her clothes or jewelry Golden Phoenix will be very popular two years from now At least as popular as I am And so you'll prosper That's right Silver Phoenix is useless if anyone wants her, let her go But Golden Phoenix will be a great success Take my advice, Auntie, and you'll do well Right, that's absolutely true The other things I said weren't true? Of course not! At my age I know... ...good advice when I hear it I can hear them arriving, I'll go down Master Luo, don't trouble yourself This is the last time I waste words on her! If she wants to be sad and lonely, so be it! It's not easy to run a flower house And you've always criticised her openly None of the seven flower-house owners in her group is any good If I made any mistake, she'd beat me Surely not Look at Golden Flower I've met three of those flower-house owners Golden Flower's Auntie is kinder than ours, she doesn't beat her girls often The girls in this house beg to be put out of their misery Tell me one flower-house owner who is good! Good people wouldn't be in this profession!

I'm most grateful to Master Wang for introducing me to this position It was nothing Master Wang, you need a fresh pipe Have some tea. Have some tea. Liu, bring a hot towel Immediately Master Wang, these will take away the bitter taste Clean the pipe Master Wang, your towel Master Wang, Crimson's mother is the only one attending her now? Jingda left her, and hasn't been replaced? And she's moved to a smaller house, is that true? I don't know Please smoke. Master Wang has left? Yes Master Hong, why did Master Wang seem so depressed? It's not Master Wang's fault! He's going back to Guangdong, promoted... Why should he be depressed? Master Wang liked Crimson When Crimson proved untrue, he married Jasmin But Jasmin wasn't true to him either, and so he went back to Crimson His heart has been in turmoil How was Jasmin untrue? Just take my word that she was Is it true that Master Wang beat Jasmin? Yes he beat her hard and abandoned her She took raw opium after that, but we saved her life Master Wang's nephew was sent away, the whole affair was hushed up Jasmin was too audacious! Crimson would so amused if she knew about it! A booking for Mistress Jade! A booking for Jade, I must get back to work Please stay, Master Hong Jasmin was well off with Master Wang! Why have an affair with his nephew? If Master Wang weren't leaving, he could start calling on Jade That reminds me... Mother asked me to discuss something with you. What is it? Jade started refusing callers when she returned from Shanjia Gardens We asked why, and she said Young Master Zhu had promised to marry her We couldn't bear to disillusion her Can you ask Young Master Zhu if he really wants to take her as a second wife? If not, please tell Jade so that she can return to work Jade is such an ambitious girl! Both of them must be dreaming! Even if Young Master Zhu weren't engaged already... ...how could Jade expect to be his first wife? Right? What's that about being a first wife? Why do some many flower girls want to be first wives? Crystal thought of nothing else, and she died And then there was Celandine,and she failed And now there's another one! Have you finished? You've forgotten the lesson of the hookah You'll never be a match for Jade Young Master Zhu, take some rest I want to talk to you What about? In July, at the Shanjia Gardens... We were talking, just like now Remember? I remember You remember what we said? Tell me We vowed to be man and wife, didn't we? We said we'd die together if we couldn't live together I knew you wouldn't forget! I've brought something... What's it? One cup for you and one for me. Drink it! What's in it? Drink it! Help! Help! Somebody! Help! Help! What's happened? What's the matter? Take it easy. What's wrong? Jade, what's happened? Did you argue? What happened? Quick! You drank this? What is it? Opium? Quick! Qiaonan, come here! You cruel and terrible man! You vowed to die with me! I'm taking you to hell! What happened? Did you drink any of it? Quick, rinse your mouth with water! You believe what callers tell you? You're so naive).! It's always nonsense! Rinse your mouth! Even if Young Master Zhu weren't engaged, he'd never take you as his first wife! First wife? He vowed to die with me! My uncle arranged the engagement, not me! I had no say! You pig! You're already engaged by your uncle! Why don't you die? Which medicine? Quick! Drink this! Why did you do this? Why? Quick, drink it! Put it there, I'll help myself If he doesn't die, why should I? I won't die before he does! Such nonsense! Take the medicine! Help her take it Uncle... Shuren, sit down. I told Jade... ...Master Zhu arranged the engagement. The young master was not to blame And I told her it doesn't matter if she's first or second wife She can marry the young master anyway, I'll be matchmaker But she refused! get it right. What on earth is she thinking? Who has she been listening to? Certainly not us! Our advice would be to work hard, not create scenes like that one! I think that what Jade did... ...was half because of Young Master Zhu, and half aimed at Treasure! You may be right! Shut-en, did you once say... ...that you'd give Jade whatever she wanted? Yes Then let me help you resolve this problem It will cost you at least 8,000, at most 10,000. Can you agree? Yes Good, then bear with me a moment I'll think of a solution How, Uncle? Don't ask If it works, I'll tell you. Be patient Pearl, please tell Jade he'll pay ...5,000 for her freedom and 5,000 for her dowry Everyone can agree to that. What do you think? It might not work I think it Will! The Zhu family is very rich Young Master Zhu, please stay for dinner Azhu, order some dishes. Young Master and I will dine here Yes Put it to her, see what she says All right, I'll try What did she say? Everything's settled, as you predicted 5,000 for her freedom, 5,000 for her dowry Jade is afraid of looking ridiculous if things don't work out as agreed Never mind! I'll take all responsibility in this matter Then I'm sure all will be well Reassure her again Shuren, everything's settled 5,000 to pay for her freedom, and 5,000 for her dowry Jade's 'face' stays intact Your side spends a bit of money, everyone's happy Who will she marry, Uncle? Don't ask, nothing's harder than arranging a marriage Anyway, you can leave it to me Uncle, who will she marry? I told you, marriages are hard to arrange! Be grateful that we've found a solution! Be patient!
