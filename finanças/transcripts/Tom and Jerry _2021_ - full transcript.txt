Oh, we've been at this all day, buddy, I get it. Those other spots didn't float your boat, but wait until you see this next place. It screams mouse house. Wait, can I say that? Is that copyrighted? Heh. There we go. Whoop. Sorry about this, the elevator's, uh, being repaired. Boom! I just had a vision! You're chillin' in your new crib, but then you get claustrophobic, and then you get dizzy, and to save you... Ta-da! Look at that view! Resplendent, ain't it, huh? It's got everything. Built-in stereo, but be careful, those seats are very flammable. I'm kidding. I'm not kidding. Jerry, baby, I know it's no beauty, but let's be honest here, with your budget, this is all you can... Hey! You don't just Batman me. You haven't even seen the trunk yet. Ahhh! Look, Dad. That blind cat's playing piano. There's a lot of weird stuff in this city. You just gotta keep walking. I mean, he's amazing on the piano, and blind, too! That's one cool cat. Man, that cat is out of sight! This is so cool. Whoa! Oh, wow! Isn't he cute? I thought I'd seen it all with the blind, piano-playing cat. Oh, man. He can see! He's a fraud! He's a regular cat playing the piano. Man, I want my money back! Ahhh. Hey. Are you okay? You gotta be careful next time. You could have really hurt me. Oh, my gosh. Suspended? Why? For starters, the 100 pounds of underwear strewn up 5th Avenue. Oh, come on, you can't blame me for that. That was a cat-and-mouse situation, and everyone knows you just don't get involved. You can reapply in four weeks. No. Please, sir, please, just... You... You... You can't do that to me. Oh. Last week, I helped a man do a pull-up for an hour. An hour! He achieved his fitness goals with me. Okay. What if I just... I come and be your assistant? Ms. Forester, you started two months ago. It just doesn't work like that. Maybe this job never was for me. - Maybe it's not. - You know what? I quit. HORSE: Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Whoa! - Hello. - Hey. Back for another free meal? So, you new in town? Somewhat. You know what they say, it's not a trip to the Big Apple without a walking tour of the city. Have you ever done one? They're very well-reviewed, actually, mine are. It's a great deal, great offer. I'm not a guest. Then, pray tell, why do you have a suitcase? I'm here to interview for one of the temporary positions. Because of the wedding. What wedding? Preeta and Ben. Ah. As in, like, the Preeta and Ben? New York society's favorite couple. It's going to be quite the event. Huh. The hotel is hiring? Yes, but they're very exclusive. They certainly wouldn't hire you. Mm. And what did you say your name was again? Linda Perrybottom. Linda Perrybottom, unfortunately, you just failed the test. What? Your interview started the minute that you walked in the door. I didn't realize, I just... Employees of the Royal Gate Hotel must be accommodating, masterly, but above all, Linda, discreet. If they're telling a perfect stranger the intimate details of the inner workings of this hotel's private events, well, that doesn't quite cut it now, does it? - I'd... - May I see your resume? - Please? - Uh... Yes, of course. Thank you. Oh, wow. Yeah, you've had a lot of really cool jobs. Yes, I have. - The Dorsey? - Dorsey. The Armada. These all are hotels? Well, none are in New York. I just moved here from London. Listen, Linda. I don't think you're right for this weekend. Oh. We just need someone more... local. Well, I understand. Thank you for the opportunity. Hi. If I wanted to apply for a temporary position for this weekend... Is this your resume? - No, it's not. - Wow, this is impressive. My only... copy. Well, you are definitely gonna get hired. In fact, I'm gonna call them right now. Right now? Yeah. - Lola... - Mm-hmm? if I wanted to shop for, say, a jacket... Uh, yeah, sure. Just to the left over there. Thank you so much. Hi, yeah, we have a very lovely young lady down at the front desk. Uh, she's going to be... Well, well, well. Look at what we got here. You know, if I wasn't a betting cat, I'd say Tommy boy here is trying to break into the hotel. That's sure what it looks like. This here is our alley, punk! Which makes this our hotel! Wait, hold up. Are you trying to break into our hotel? Yo, guys, don't worry about it. It was a big misunderstanding. Right, Tom? Are you laughing at me? Now, I'm sure you know what I do to cats that laugh at me. Come on, boss! Preach! Preach to him! Now, I was about to, if you would shut that grill and let me handle this. My bad, boss. So, are you gonna answer me? Oh, snap! It's five-o! Drop and run! - Oh, no, not again! - Somebody pick me up, - I can't run that fast! - Hey, I'll see you again, Tom! - Break yourself! - Hey, get back here! Phew! Oh, yeah! Welcome. Thank you so much. - You must be... - Hi. Buongiorno. Forester, Kayla. I'm sorry in advance about my resume, but there was a child downstairs trying to spit their Hubba Bubba under a table. So I tore off a piece. Good. I'm Terence Mendoza, Events Manager. And this is Mr. Henry Dubros. - Hi. - A pleasure. He's our general manager. And I assume that that's the aquatics manager? That's Goldie. She has no official position at the hotel. That's a fish. That's the... I must say, this is a very impressive resume. The Dorsey? Oh. The Dorsey. You know, I hate to name names, but, uh, I will. You must have known Mrs. Josephine Pennybaker. She was my mentor at Cornell. It's an Ivy League school founded in 1865 by Mr. Ezra Cornell. That's where I got my master's. I'm just sharing. Of course I know old Jojo Pennyfoot. Yeah. What a hoot. Pennyfoot? Well, Miss Forester, we'll cut to the chase. As I'm sure you know, we have a very high-profile event happening here this weekend. Of course, I'm very aware of Ben and Preeta's wedding. Well, we need to hire additional staff through the week. But they must maintain the level of service guests of the Royal Gate expect. - Nonetheless. - And I'll be honest, it's not often we come across a resume this distinguished. Excuse me, but this, this is just a piece of paper. If I'm gonna be worthy of this institution, you need to see me in... action. Are you gonna pick it up or just leave it there? Yes, sir. Put it in the bin. Terence. She thought the fish was the head of the department. Really? A fish can't even walk. It can't even... Terence. You're hired. - Really? - Yes. I mean, thank you. Can you start today? That's gonna be a tall order. Mm... Very in demand. Okay. Yeah, you know what? I'm gonna pull some strings. It's difficult, but, yeah, no problem. One other thing. Uh, we will be asking all temporary staff to stay at the hotel through the week leading up to the wedding. Uh, just so that we can be available to guests at a moment's notice. Is that something you'd be comfortable with? Anything for this hotel. No, it's better down. 10-4, good buddy. Breaker, breaker, 1-9. Go get 'em. Hair's better up. It's more professional. Good morning. Good morning, sir. The Royal Gate opened its doors in 1930 and was declared a New York City landmark - by 1962. - Mm. It's been through two major renovations, yet it remains the beacon of service excellence. This place has been host to four presidents, three popes, two kings, one queen, oh, and Drake. There are 260 rooms, 104 suites, and 21 floors of impeccable luxury. The water pressure is never below 50 PSI, and our thread count is never below 800. - Button, please. - Sorry, sir. The spa is top-of-the-line, and our spin instructor won the Tour de France. Twice. Right. This wedding is the most prestigious event the Royal Gate has hosted. And it will be a perfect success. It has to be. The positive press an event of this magnitude can generate is invaluable. Would you stop that, please? - The... Yeah, sir. - Okay. Yes. It's just, it tends to ride up. Our wedding menu is being designed by our very own Chef Jackie. He's a rising star, and whispers are that Michelin agrees. Hector! Hector! Look alive, people. Why do you hate me? Who butchered these onions? Who? Oh, I don't know. Francois? - We should leave. - You're killing my career! He's a bit tricky, but he's an artist. And we're lucky to have him. And some people may see anger, but me? No, no, no, no, no, no. I see passion. Do you hear that? - Hear what? - Your footsteps. - Oh. - Carrara marble. This is Gavin, our doorman. Master of small talk. This is Kayla, who recently worked at the Dorsey Hotel in London. Did she now? Yes. And she'll be helping us out this week. Mm. I'm sure you'll knock 'em dead, Kayla. Morning! That's Joy, the bell girl. I'm convinced she was raised by wolves. - What? - She's not important. Okay. But this glass atrium. Oh, wow. Now that is something. It's one of a kind. I call it the "crowning jewel of the Royal Gate." This is Cameron, the barman. Popping bottles. Excuse me? Don't spill any on your Jordan 5s. These are actually retro reissues. Obviously, it's the lace tips. - NikeLab? - Flight Club. On Broadway. I'm sorry to interrupt your riveting TED Talk, but why are you pouring champagne at 11 o'clock in the morning? I was told to pour two glasses for the VIPs that just arrived. They're here? - Yes, sir. - Who's here? The bride and groom. Come with me. Wow! - Isn't it perfect? - I love it. Just as much as I did last week when we visited. All I care about in the whole world is that you're happy. Think your dad's gonna like it? You keep asking what my dad thinks, I'm gonna send him on the honeymoon with you. Clear the way, coming through. I sure hope room service is open all night. Right, Toots? Ben, Preeta, welcome back to the Royal Gate. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. It's a toast to your upcoming nuptials. It's so great to be back here. Thank you very much. - Appreciate it. - Absolutely. And thank you guys for everything. It's great to see you again, Terence. - Thank you very much. - Mouse! Oh, my God! Spike, get back here! - Hey! Hey! - Oh, my gosh! Simmer down, boy! Hey! Get back here! - I'm so sorry. - It's no problem. Sorry. - A little jumpy, huh? - Ooh. I'm sorry, he's a little animated. Yeah, um... Oh, she's so sweet. Wow, you're really good with animals. Toots is usually really shy. And by "shy," I mean, she... She scratches people's faces off. - Oh. - Oh. Well... she can smell a bona fide animal lover. You know, Kayla's new here and I was just about to explain to her that, uh... we traditionally have a no-pets policy... - Oh, wow. - ...but, uh, you know... I would be delighted to make an exception. - Is your hand okay? - It's fine. Looks like your hand's bleeding. It's fine, it's perfect. We've prepared a list of some of the most prestigious dog parks in the area, and I think the one on 11th Street is particularly luxurious. But are the people uptight? Because... I mean, do they yell at the dogs for being off-leash? - Spike, he's... he's... Yeah. - You can just say it. - He's disgusting. - Yeah. - He's disgusting? - Huh? There is one that I know about that's behind this falafel place on 17th. It's not technically a dog park, but they let their dogs off-leash and they kinda look out for each other. It's pretty low-key. That is amazing. Thank you, Kayla. - Thanks, Kayla. - Yes. Thank you, Kayla. Of course. Any time. I just have to say, I follow you guys on Instagram, and you are the cutest couple ever. And that rock, whoa! - Yes, well... - Yeah. Could see that thing from outer space. Good job. You know, you could see our love from outer space. Oh. That was fantastic. - Great. Thank you. - Shall we? - We shall. - Come on, Tootsie. Come on, Spike. But in all seriousness, is there a safe in the hotel? It's a giant diamond. Of course, of course. How was the ride? Very good, thank you very much. Not... Not to worry. That's probably a scream of delight. You know, someone seeing their beautiful room for the first time. It happens all the time. Lola? Can you see them to their room? - Excuse me. - Of course. Leo is shaken to the core. The mouse ran right over his foot. Look, Terence, I've worked too frigging hard to be saddled with a bunch of inept... Wonderful group of gifted colleagues to have my career tossed into a fish bucket over some infestation. Jackie, Jackie, Jackie, Jackie. I know the gravity of this situation. - And I will handle it. - I'll catch it, sir. Him. Or her. It could be a female... - I'm not gender biased - No, no. - and I don't want to go by... - No, no, it's fine. It's gender-fluid now. The point is, I will catch that little mouse, and I will be discreet about it. Okay. I need you to understand the sensitivity of this matter. - Yes. - If a picture of this mouse is tweeted up to insta-book-face or the ticky-tock, we will be ruined. No, sir. We're not ruined, because it's not gonna happen. Okay? So, you guys clear your heads about it. That Rodentia is toast. What are you doing? Oh, my gosh, you scared me. I scared you? You know, you're the one creeping around like a thief. I am on a mouse hunt. Thank you. Need any help? What? Because I'm... I'm... I'm the new girl? Well, obviously, you haven't seen my resume. It clearly states that I am completely capable of doing anything that is required to do that is needed to be done here. Oh, right. And how hard can it be to catch a little mouse? Honestly, I wasn't expecting you to say yes. You know, you got that whole independent vibe thing going on, and I don't normally get involved with how the new kids do their jobs. So... My name, um... My name is Kayla. Yeah. My mom calls me Kayla. Oh, okay, Kayla. Well, I doubt that mouse catching is on your resume, but if you do catch him, you should come by for a celebratory beverage. Well, start popping another bottle of champagne now, because any minute now, he's mine. He's... One second. What the... Did someone leave their... What is that? The sign of a worthy competitor. Guess who's at the party? Come on, man. Have some self-respect. You are in a dumpster and Jerry's inside, safe and warm. Look at him. Just scouting the room and seeing what he can steal next. Now, who's the cat and who's the mouse? Hey, let's get back in there and smash that mouse up good. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Tom, my brother, there's room for both cats and mice to be happy. Look, I'm sure if you asked to share his food... Share? You're lucky the kids are watching, okay? We're cats. Cats take! Come on, he's just an innocent little mouse. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Why're we always arguing? We shouldn't be fighting, we look alike. Why are we doing this? Look, how about we do something different this time? Why don't we let Tom make up his own mind, okay? Now, see, that is a good idea. Tom, I believe in you. What a sucker. Now go make me proud, Tom. Whoa! Ahhh! Life, do you hear me? Give my creation life! Launch the third swing! ...my creation life! Go for Lone Wolf. Who? It's Kayla, sir. Just trying on one of those new code names. Well, don't. Have you located the room yet? I'm continuing to get noise complaints. Yes, sir... Well, no, sir, I haven't yet, but I'm... I'm on it. Over. Well, hurry up so you can get back to finding that mouse. And please, do not say "over." This isn't Star Trek. Takes all the fun out of walkie-talkies. I mean, what's the point, then? I can still hear you. I have eyes on the target, sir, and I am moving north... I'm moving toward the door. Oh, no. What did you do? Who... Wait a second, I know you. I know you! You're the cat from the park with the bike and you tackled me. Is this personal? Is this some form of revenge sabotage? What are you... You're trying to tell me something? Okay. Two syllables. One word. Is it a movie? Is it a cartoon? What's this? A pig? A mouse? A little mouse? What? He was here, too? Gosh, I gotta catch that little disaster. If I don't, I'm gonna lose this job. Wait a second. You're a cat. Can't you catch a mouse? Isn't that in your DNA? Huh. You got a name? That is really well done, Mot. Tom? You could be in a lot of trouble for this. I mean, just look at this mess. So, what should we do about this? You wanna catch a mouse together? There could be a big reward in it for you. Sir, I instructed her to get rid of an animal, not find another. Here's how I see it, sir. We have a mouse problem at this hotel, so we could hire an exterminator to have him tramp up and down this whole hotel, just filling it with his poison and alerting Ben and Preeta to the possibility of vermin at their wedding, or we could leverage millions of years of predatory-prey evolution and choose a more subtle and eco-friendly solution. That's why I brought on Tom. You brought on... She's a temp. She doesn't even have hiring power. It's what we did at the Dorsey, sir. Really? That is not what they did at the Dorsey. Why don't I ask Mrs. Pennybaker? Who... wouldn't want you to ask Mrs. Pennybaker from the Dorsey? Why don't I call her right now, huh? Absolutely not. No one's calling anyone. Word gets out that we're thinking of hiring a cat, well, the mouse problem could leak. And if word gets out that we're refusing to hire a cat, PETA will be here before you can say "discriminatory practices." Mm-hmm. You need to think outside the box, Terence. Could he wear a hat? Excuse me, sir? Could he wear a jaunty hat? And, uh, perhaps a name tag? I think that'd be adorable. One second. Sir, you, you can't be serious? A hat? As you can see, he would love to wear a hat. And a name tag. Well, then I think this is a creative and elegant solve, Kayla. Thank you, sir. As do I. That'll be all. Thank you. You gotta fix your name tag. There you go. Yeah. You look good. I figured out who you are. Who am I? You're one of those millennials. that thinks they can get whatever they want whenever they want without working for it, preferably with free shipping. Who doesn't like free shipping? This is a cutthroat $200 billion industry. And I've clawed my way all the way to the middle. And I don't intend on stopping there. Okay? You better hope this little cat plan works. Because if it doesn't, I'll make sure you'll never work in New York City again. And that goes for you, too, Tom. Yes, you. Enjoy it while it lasts because... This is just a test, Tom. Uh-uh. He doesn't think that we can do it. Just like most people I know. But you and I, we're different, Tom. We don't go down easy. All right, I'm gonna start in the lobby. Tom? Okay. All right. You done? Ahhh! Mm? Listen here, kitty-cat, I don't like being pounded. Capiche? I see you again, I bash your head in. Spike, get back here. Saw you again! Toots. There you are, girl. What were you doing? I was looking all over for you. Whew! Tom, what are you doing in the lobby? Oh! I see you becoming the hunter... feeling the hunted. Yeah, there we go. Tracking the trail. Yeah, you smell those little paws. Yep. My gosh, Tom. I mean, be the predator. Yeah. Oh. Okay, why are you... You're drawing a... Look, I... Oh. Tom, that is a "wanted dead or alive..." That is a stick figure of a mouse and your Es are backwards. That's never gonna work. - You're looking for a mouse? - Gosh! Hi. Yes, Joy. Yeah. Well, have you checked the tiny little door on the 10th floor? At first, I thought, "Whoa, Joy, you became really big. When did that happen?" But then I saw another door that was normal sized and thought, "Okay, so one of your eyeballs got small." - But then I blinked a ton - Yeah. and realized, "No, Joy, just this door was really small." So, I cut up a towel to make tiny little towels and left them here. But now they're gone. Thank you, Joy. You are a fascinating creature. Hmm. Me, fascinating? I like that. Listen here, punk. You and I gotta chat... What? You want me to grab it? Thank you. Oh, wow. This is so detailed. What kind of tiny printer or... And it's scented? What the... Listen here, Mr. Mouse. Oh. Jerry. I need this job. So, simply put, this is a hotel and you're a mouse. So, you gotta go. Well, if that's how you feel about it, I'll have to introduce you to my enforcer. Oh! Oh, my gosh! Oh. No! Oh. You do not get to beat up my enforcer! Open up the door! Open up! Let me in! - Kayla! - Argh! What do you need, sir? Meet me in the bridal suite immediately. Right away, sir. You figure out a solution to get that mouse out of here. Uh, come on in. Hey, guys. Sorry, it's sort of the wedding situation room up here. Wow. Ah! Terence, you were right. This simulator's amazing. - Ah! - It really replicates how bad I am at golf. Oh, I see that. I haven't seen this many shanks since I was in prison. White-collar crime, but, uh... Baby, do you wanna maybe take a little break? Or if you wanna do something together, we can go scuba diving in Tahiti. We, uh, could go hang gliding in the Alps. Or, uh, we could go to this alien planet and just sort of, uh, shoot some aliens. Kayla, you could just put those down. Sorry. - Where? Here? - Just right behind you. - Oh, okay. - Yeah. Terence, actually, could I grab that one from you? Ah, good. It's heavy. Think this might be it. Just a little bit of a surprise for me and the Mrs. Let's see. By the way, while I have you, Terence, um, - could I ask you a question? - Absolutely. What do you think about elephants? Um... Elephants. I think they are majestic and noble creatures. No, I mean for the wedding. Oh, at the wedding? Real elephants? Yeah, I sort of thought it might be fun. Babe, I never said that they wouldn't be fun. Oh... So, uh, maybe, you know... Maybe we'll do elephants. Maybe we do elephants. Have you, um, considered maybe a smaller animal like a... - like a hamster? - Hamster? - Oh. That's cute. - Yeah. We were gonna ride in on it, though. Can, can you ride a hamster? Oh, yes. I mean, as long as you have enough of them, - you can ride them silly. - Yes. Great. Yeah. Well, that's something to consider, too. Babe, if getting elephants at the wedding would make you happy... You being happy would make me happy. Aw! Okay, get the elephants. All right! We're gonna get the elephants. Great! We'll do the elephants! Boom. Oh! It's a motorized skateboard. I love those. It's got, uh, you know, Wi-Fi. Why does a skateboard need Wi-Fi? Why the fi not? "Why the fi not?" See what I'm dealing with? Oh. Hello? Hey. - Yeah, uh, he's right here. - Who is it? My dad. What? Do I look okay? For a phone call? Yes. Right. One second. Phew. Hello, Mr. Mehta. You sound like you look amazing. Uh-huh? - If you need anything at all, please don't hesitate to call. - Yeah. We'll help you accordingly. You know what, Terence, Spike got into some burritos - earlier and, well... - Huh? I was, you know. Do you mind? Um... Of course. I'm ready! I'm ready! Thank you. Kayla, can you... Uh, actually, I would love to keep Kayla and maybe run through some bridesmaids-related stuff with her. - You know, coordinating colors. - Sure. I have a very good eye. No, that's fine. I'll just run through it all with Kayla. Here we go. I got the lead. I got the lead. Come on. Very well. - Of course. - Thank you, Terence. - Kayla. - Yes. Wow, what a view! So, what are your bridesmaids colors? I lost my ring. The big one? Yeah, my big one. My... My only one. How? Well, I was, I was on my way to the spa, and Ben had told me to put it in the safe because he's always convinced that I'm gonna lose it. But you did lose it. Yeah, I mean, I misplaced it. I thought first someone must've taken it, but... And would you say that it is still in the spa? Or the pool. Or the lounge. I was all over the place today, but I don't want Ben to know that it was ever missing. Really? I mean, won't he just be all adorable and understanding about it? Babe, that was a really big ring. - Ah. Understood. - Hey. Hi. - Hi. - What did my dad want? Nothing. He was just, uh, we were just kinda bonding. Great. Uh, where is your ring? Which ring? Your engagement ring? The giant one that I gave you for love. Oh, um... I... Uh, the thing is... It's a funny story actually, sir. I actually took it. Yes, I did. - To go get cleaned. - Oh. I took it to go get a scrub-a-dub and be all shiny for the wedding. Bright as bright as a diamond. Great. That's actually very thoughtful. - Thank you. - Thank you, Kayla. By the way, we really wanna put some kind of gratuity for you on the bill. Whatever you see fit, sir. - Thanks. - Love you, guys. - Love you. - In different ways. Thank you. Anytime. Whoop. Excuse me. Come on, come on, come on. Stop, stop! Stop! Ow! - No, no, no, wait, wait! - Uh-oh. - What? - Here it comes. Are you okay? - Oh, yes. - No, no, no! Oh, come on! Stop the beeping! You're making him self-conscious! How many burritos did you eat? Oh! I see what you did. Okay. I'm scooping the poop, huh? You saw he did it on purpose... Let's go! Joy? Hey, Kayla, oh, how's the mouse hunt going? Oh, it's going. By the way, quick question for you. Say a VIP person lost a ring and someone wanted to look for said ring without raising any eyebrows, where would you say that person should look? Oh, my God, I, I, I love riddles. Um... Well, if I were that someone, ah, but I'm not. But I could be. Who knows? One day. One can only dream. VIP. Sorry, back to the question. Um... It would depend on the size of the object. Is it a car? Is it alive? Could it be a dog? I lose things all the time. I lost my baby brother last week. Don't tell anyone, please, because I was like, "Joey, where are you? Please?" And then, thank the Lord, he... Yeah. Tom! What? Whoa, whoa, whoa, chill out! Besides, that is never gonna keep out that minuscule sociopath. What do you mean, he's gone? Like, like gone-gone? Are you sure? Yes! Booyah, Tom! Oh! ♪ More hot milk for you tonight ♪ Boom! Mr. Dubros, I am delighted to inform you that the job that we hired Tom for, - it is completed. - Oh, wonderful. Now we just have to figure out how to let him go without triggering an equal employment issue. Oh. I should probably look into severance packages. - Right. - Maybe a month of tuna? - 'Cause he's a cat. - Mm-hmm. I think it's one per family. And if there's any way to make sure the guests get these as soon as they check in... The bride's taken quite a shine to you. I don't know, I mean, whatever I can do to help with the wedding craziness. They seem really stressed out with it all. If anything, the ceremony is the perfect test for a relationship. 'Cause you can promise all you want in the vows. When it comes down to it, it's how you handle the pressure of the planning. Some couples rise to the challenge and others fall. Hmm. I should write that down. So, did Tom tell you the good news? The mouse problem has officially been handled. Hey! She came, she saw, she exterminated. Yeah. So, how about we celebrate? Flat club soda coming right up. Yeah, there we go. The real wild stuff. Wow, those little paws move quick, huh? You should be his manager. I mean, sure, why not? Maybe they'll see how much I'm killing it and bring me on permanently to run everything? Okay, so somebody thinks they can skip a few steps. Mm-mm. No, it's just... I mean, where I came from, there were no real opportunities. Where's that? A small town in Penn State. Picture seeing your whole future in front of you and you can't stand it. That was me, there. I just wanted to find that thing that made me feel... Important? Yeah. And New York seemed like the right place to look for it. Well, I mean, I've heard about your resume. About that... Hey, come on, don't be shy. Whatever shot you're looking for, you deserve. You know, you're proof that it takes more than a fancy resume to make it big in New York. Right? Guilty as charged. Toots needs a little pawpicure. Kayla mentioned you might have a spot. We could actually see her right now. That would be so great. ♪ Whoo ♪ ♪ Well ♪ ♪ Don't you know, baby ♪ ♪ Child, don't you know, baby ♪ ♪ Oh, don't you know, baby ♪ ♪ Little girl, little girl, Don't you know, oh ♪ ♪ Please listen to me, baby ♪ - ♪ Girl, I'm in love With you so ♪ - Yeah ♪ Turn your lamp down low ♪ ♪ I said turn Your lamp down low ♪ ♪ Whoo ♪ ♪ Turn it down ♪ ♪ Please turn your lamp down ♪ ♪ Whoo! ♪ Okay, come on, baby. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome.

Give it to me. Now. Drop the ring. What do you want for it, Jerry? You wanna stay here? You little con artist. Fine. We can discuss this on my terms. Okay, no problem! I got it! Tom... - Excuse me! - Where did he go? - Excuse me! - Tom, where did he go? - Find him. Now. - Stop. I said, stop! Stop! Stop! Calmate! I'm the boss. Why do I see temporary employees socializing on hotel property in the middle of their shift? We were just... Terence, we're celebrating, you know? The, uh, hotel's mouse problem is taken care of. Oh, yeah, congratulations. Teamwork is dream work, right? Yeah, it's taken care of, right, Tom? It is so taken care of, right, Tom? What... What is he doing? He's not doing nothing. - Why are you acting nervous? - Huh? You're acting nervous. I'm not acting nervous. No? What's in your pocket? Ah. - Oh. - Terence. - Wait! No, he's in the pocket. - Terence, what are you doing? The mouse is in the pocket. Come back here! Come back here! Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry! Whoa! Come here, pussycat. Everyone, keep calm! Oh, no! Ooh. The mouse! Huh? Whoa! Oh... What the... Oh. This is definitely your bad. Kayla, and what would you call this, huh? This was a mistake. It was a total misunderstanding. This is a dereliction of duty! And it's a reflection of the absence of character! It's an embarrassment to the hotel. And it's an insult to you. That's how serious this matter is, sir. I agree. Terence, I'm placing you on leave. What? It's clear that the magnitude of this wedding has overwhelmed you and you're in something of a state. - I think a break would... - Hold on a sec. Let me make sure that we're on the same page here regarding the basic facts of this. The cat that she forced us to hire failed to catch the mouse. Kayla said she got rid of the mouse. Isn't that right? - That is what I said. - Ah! That is what you said. But that is not what you did. The mouse that caused all that destruction to our lobby is still in the hotel. I saw him in the animal tornado. Terence, listen to yourself. No one saw a mouse. I saw the mouse. But they did see you acting erratically towards Miss Forester after bringing the groom's bulldog into a bar. She brought the kitty-cat to the bar, too. Tom is an employee. He has a name tag. This is insane. I'm going insane right now. Well, you're certainly acting insane. You caused tens of thousands of dollars of damage to the hotel, you've terrified our guests, and now you're attempting to frame it as Kayla's fault? You know what? You can't do this. You can't fire the event manager in the middle of an event. Please leave on your own merits, Terence. I don't want to have to call security. Please don't do this. Oh. Okay. Okay. Argh! Oh, my days. And I'm not picking it up. Get your tail out of your ears. It's disgusting. Well, this is a disaster. Yeah. Firing our events manager before the biggest and most important event this hotel has thrown in years. The only reason I felt comfortable asking Terence to take leave is because we have someone with your wealth of experience here. With the what now? I got a call from Miss Preeta. She told me that you quietly found a very important missing item she was looking for. You're multitalented, Kayla. Do you think you can handle the role of interim event manager? Are you kidding? Yes, yes, of course. It's a massive endeavor. Sir, "massive endeavor" is my middle name. It's Judith, but you get the point. I know you're new, but your employment history convinces me you're qualified to take this on. And who knows, if this weekend goes well, we may be discussing a more permanent position on Monday. I can't imagine... anything that could possibly mess this up. Stop it. You guys gotta stop fighting. It's like you've been doing this for years. Listen, first of all, thank you for the ring. Helpful to have it back after you stole it. Never mind. Remember when I said to the both of you that letting you stay here wasn't up to me? Well, if you look right there, I'm in charge now, all right? And this wedding it's a huge responsibility. It's the shot that I've been waiting for and I can't screw it up. So, you two, you gotta go. Stop looking at me like that. Ugh! Okay. Maybe you can stay here. But not like this. Uh-uh. That little mess you caused downstairs, it's a disaster. You know what, you wanna stay, right? Fine. One condition. You two have to prove to me that you can coexist together. And stay as far away from here as possible. Got it? So, tomorrow, I'm gonna plan an entire day for you two to spend together out there, in the Big Apple. And if you do this, you guys can stay. Do we have a deal? Your car will be here at 9:00 a.m. Don't be late. Okay, guys, please, everyone... Uh... Please... Any, any true emergencies? True emergencies? Let's just go around the room one at a time. I just caught my finger in the door and... Okay, please, seriously, just shut up, please. Uh... Madam Kaydra, are we sure the mouse is gone? Rumors are the guest list includes a Michelin restaurant inspector, so one slip-up and me and my son are out on the streets. Jackie, rest assured, the mouse is currently being taken care of. Anyone else have any other problems? Uh, did you address the, um, elephant that's here? Cameron, yes, I addressed the elephant in the room. You weren't here for it. Yeah, no, I mean literally. Where do you want 'em? Um... Pardon. The elephants? Can't leave 'em in the truck. No. That would be inhumane. - They can be parked at valet. - Okay. Relax, Cecil. Okay. How about we go ahead and put all the birds in the staff room? Um, the animal wrangler said this time of year they need room to socialize and mate. I think they've socialized enough, Joy. This is a wedding after all, not spring break. - Ca-caw! - So let's just go ahead and put 'em in the staff room. What... What sound do peacocks make? - I mean... - Ca-caw! I think that sounds right. Kayla, come on already. Oh, gosh, I so regret saying yes to this. Pa-pa-pam-pam! Oh, my God. You look incredible. Thank you. Well, we are a full-service hotel here. Be it dog walking, or quite even possibly, saving someone's lost ring. Hmm. Is there anything else I can help you with, milady? Oh, no, thank you. This wedding is bonkers enough already. Why don't you just say no? Oh, no, we've... We've just decided to, um, avoid behaviors that might give the impression that we're fighting. But what about when it's just you two? I mean, we disagree, of course, about how big - the wedding should be. - Wow. But I guess there was so much pressure to maintain an image that somewhere we forgot how to fight. Ben really loves you, Preeta. Yeah. He's a really good guy. It's just that when he goes, he goes big. And I love that about him. Yeah. But I have this feeling that this small Indian wedding is gonna be a great big disaster. Beautiful day at Yankee Stadium. Top of the 9th inning, two out, and the Yankees up by one. Big Alex Gordon at the plate. That ball is crushed. This might be it. The ball game may be over. The Yankees could move on and... Oh! What's this? A hairy fan has reached over and caught the ball. Mayhem unfolds at Yankee Stadium. Two baseball fans seated in right field interrupted what could have been the final out for the Yankees. The culprits were later taken away by animal control. In other news... Oh, my gosh! What was... Ben, was that a drone? Not just any drone. That was a CH-4000, military-grade. - Yeah. - But I'm sure it's harmless. Joy? - Should I go see what that... - Yes. Yes, Joy. - Oh, okay. Going. - Yes, Joy, go. Yep. That was a scream. It's harmless. Yeah. Military things usually are. I got this drone because I thought, uh, when Preeta and I come into the wedding on the elephants, that the drone could be kind of, uh... As I'm saying the words "drone" and "elephant," out loud to another human being, I'm wondering, is this, um... is this a lot? Weddings, Ben, they're already stressful enough, - you know? - Yeah. The important part is that Preeta, she can't wait to marry you. So, just take it easy, you know? Enjoy the ride. - Yeah. - You only got one shot at it. Like, one chance to, like, get it right. Uh-huh. So just go ahead and pull it back. Yeah. Pull it back and just sorta let it rip. Like, really, just pull it way back and just explode out of it. That is not what I was - trying to say to you. - Yeah. They said they'd disabled the weapons. - There's weapons? - Uh, I'll make sure. I found it. I found the... Oh, my God! Help me, help me, help me! She found it. Don't look it in the eyes, Joy. Welcome to your new home, gentlemen. Hey, hey, hey, pipe down! You already been fed. Hello. Quiet. Get comfortable. You're gonna be here a while. Have a nice stay! ♪ Alley cats ♪ ♪ Come out and play ♪ That's that cat from the alley! Well, well, well. So, we meet again. You know, you and me? We got some unfinished business to settle. Dinner time. Snack is what I like to call it. Relax, you two. This won't take long, as long as you don't fight it. Gotcha. Oh, don't be scared, come here! Are you gonna eat him? Why don't you be a good little kitty and hand him over before I stop being nice? Yeah, what are you, like, friends or something? Go ahead. Eat him now. If we can't eat him, you gotta eat him. Looks like a nice snack. Chew. Chew. - Eat him. Eat. Eat. - Chew. Chew. Chew. - Eat it. - Chew. Chew. Ah, ah, there you go. Bottoms up! - Eat him! - There you go! Is it as good as it looks? What are you waiting for? Chew. Chew. Chew. Chew. Chew. Chew. Chew. If you don't start chewing, we will. Oh, that's spicy. Cajun. Chew. Chew. Chew. Wait a minute. Something ain't right. Open your mouth. You heard him, open your trap! Hey, cat. You got a visitor. - What? - Visitors? He didn't even eat him! Mouse, you got one, too. Hola, Tom. How are they treating you? This place is, uh, horrible. Cheese stick? Oh, you don't want it? Here's the deal. I know you wanna come back to the hotel, and I can help you do it. As you may already know, Kayla's been put in charge of the wedding. And, yeah, it's a tough job. That's why she sent me here to bring you back. So you can help. But there's a catch. I can only take one of you. You know what your friend said? That it's your fault. Maybe I shouldn't say this, you know? He says you smell like... Like tuna. And a cheesy foot. He also said that you're, uh... You're emotionally unavailable. He also wants you to stay here and rot. Now, you put me in such a tough position. As you already know, I can only take one of you back to the hotel. Will it be the cat? Or the mouse? Okay. I've made my decision. Check this out. In celebrity news, major commotion at the Royal Gate Hotel as New York's elite couple, Preeta and Ben, are tying the knot in a private, intimate wedding. Ah... Ah... Ta-da! Ta-da! Okay. No, no. No, no, no. Move. Mr. Mehta, what do you think? You're not wearing a turban. Is that, Is that a question or a statement? I didn't know if you wanted an answer. I've been getting really into cricket! You're doing great. How are we doing on the champagne? We good, we good. There's just a lot of it, and not enough hands. Okay. All right, bro. Take these upstairs. I'll be up in a minute. You good? Yeah, yeah. I think so. Momma bird, we got a problem here. We need you. Okay, on my way. - Hmm. - What? I think I might have just pulled this off. Ladies and gentlemen, the ceremony is about to begin. All right, Malcolm, game face, look impressive. FYI, I'm always ready. LOL. Ben, this feels so embarrassing. Well, if it's any consolation, you look very beautiful. And in a way, you know, we're the elephants. Because we're never gonna forget this wedding. Here we go. Wow! Preeta! Wow. The, the elephant are normal in these kind of events? We are an elephant-friendly establishment. Friendly establishment. Wow. That's really beautiful. The elephants were a great choice. Welcome back. Consider this wedding a welcome party. Just for you. Oh, no. No. What is Jerry doing here? Well, that must be awkward. With all the horrible things he said about you. That you're not fit to work at the Royal Gate. Tom, come on, now. Let's not be insensitive. Oh, would you just leave him alone already? Well, I got something to say. Okay, go ahead and speak, then! As I was saying... Gotcha! Now let's go finish what we started. Have fun. Why is Tom here? What the... I don't see Jerry. Do you see Jerry? Uh, no. I don't. - Hi. Hey. - Hi. Isn't this great? And look, your dad loves it. At least, I think he's loving it. It's kinda hard to tell. Not bad. Ah. Smile for the drone-cam. Drone-cam? Yeah. They can put a cam on a drone. Wait. Are those peacocks? Yeah, I think they might have just been part of the, uh, exotic bird package. And, and even the tiger? Well, the tiger is our first. I begged you to stop doing this stuff. I'm sorry. That is the last surprise. You just don't listen. Listen to what? Hmm? No, Tom. Don't do it. Do it, Tom. Do it. You're dead, mouse. Yes! OMG. Is that a mouse? WT... Preeta! Mouse! Mouse! Mouse, mouse, mouse, mouse, mouse! - We got him. - Oh, my baby! No, no. Stay calm, everyone! Mouse! Ahh! Mouse! Mouse! Mouse! Ah, mouse! Ugh. Get off. You? No. Me. Mouse, mouse, mouse, mouse, mouse! Mouse! Please remain calm. Out of my way! Out of my way! Malcolm! I'm coming to save you! Oh, no! Huh? Oh. Preeta! Out the back door. Let's get out of here! Oh, no! Cecil! Malcolm! Stop! Stop! What is he doing here? Terence is here because he tried to warn me about Kayla, who clearly lied about who she is. No, sir. Uh, this was a misunderstanding. It was, um... No. Actually, it wasn't a misunderstanding. Sir, when I came into your office that day, I had stolen someone else's resume... and pretended that it was mine. I don't have any qualifications for this. Or for anything, really. You not only destroyed this wedding, but may have destroyed the future of this hotel. I'm sorry. Perhaps I could salvage this. Don't bother. I just came here to inform Mr. Dubros that the wedding's off. Preeta. Oh... I guess we were both in over our heads. I... Kayla, I don't get why you just... I was gonna tell you, Cameron. I was gonna tell all of you the truth. I just wanted to prove to you all that I deserved this. That I could do this. I'm sorry. And don't even think about coming back. You think I was gonna let some street animals live at the Royal Gate Hotel? Oh, no. Hey. Thanks for meeting me. I know I wasn't very convincing yesterday. But what I was trying to say was, I really am sorry. I still can't believe that I saw everything that woman accomplished on her resume, and I thought that my pure ambition was an even swap. Come on, Kayla, everybody screws up. It's just hard. I mean, every morning I wake up and I look at my phone, and my newsfeed is filled with people who are our age, you know, they're succeeding at what they're doing. Well, maybe we just need to stop comparing ourselves to everybody and just work for it. Listen, Kayla, you're gonna get the skills. You already got the smarts, you got the funny, and you got the love of helping people. Even if I wanted to make this right, I couldn't. Well, maybe they can help convince you otherwise. No. You two are the last people that I wanna see right now. What is all this? I think that's Preeta and Ben. All right, you know what? Just cut the chalkboard act and tell me what's going on. Okay, you and Jerry have an idea for what? How did you... Elephants? Ca-caw! And peacocks? A big cake? Guys, are you just making fun of me? Oh, so, this is like charades? No. 'Cause he did like a... No? All right, never mind. I think what they're trying to tell us is that if we go back to the hotel, quickly salvage what we can, and we find a last-minute venue and some sort of befitting celebrant, we can fix this by putting on a makeshift wedding. And you got all of that from that? Yeah. We kinda understand each other now. Let's do it. What do we have to lose? Hey. Where's Preeta going? A doorman never tells. JFK. Okay, guys. I know that you both don't get along, but now it's time to change that. So, help me save this wedding and go catch that bride, okay? And bring her back here. What do you want? I just need to talk to Ben for a minute. No, don't you think you've done enough? Ben. This wedding can still happen, today. How? I mean, everything's destroyed. It doesn't matter. Preeta never actually wanted any of this. She just wanted you to listen to her. I, I don't think so. Wait. Someone once told me that a wedding is a couple's very first test. And some couples, well, they rise to that. Stupid. What kind of idiot said that? - I mean, seriously... - Me. Oh. I apologize. I'm sorry. I was being, uh, sarcastic. You can rise, Ben. We can still pull this off. Needless to say, everything at this hotel will be at your disposal. Except, of course, the hotel. What about the garden across the street? Uh, I'm sorry, garden? Mm-hmm. Wait, do you mean Central Park? Sure. Whatever nickname you have for it. That's actually an amazing idea. Joy, thank you. Yeah? Yeah. Well, how about, Terence, you and Ben get a guest list together, and then let everyone know where to meet us? You expect me to assist you after what you've done to this hotel? I think we both did some things that we regret to keep our jobs. Tom and Jerry told me what you did. I'm not gonna tell anybody. Okay, thank you. If Tom and Jerry can be out there working together, then so can we. Roger, roger, over. Come in, Tom and Jerry. I know you can't talk, but I'm sure you can hear me. Preeta's on Lexington, and it looks like she's headed for the Midtown Tunnel. No, wait, they're actually making a left turn on 57th. They're going for the Queensboro Bridge. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Guys, you have to get them before they make it to the bridge. Hello? Ugh, this no-talking thing is really getting old. Whoa! Toots! Stop the car! Follow them. Let's go. Could you keep up? Great job, guys. I'm sending you a new location. Toots. Come back! What... Kayla, what is going on? Hear me out. I know yesterday was a disaster. But I promise you that most of the chaos was because of me. And them. But just like me, they've changed their ways. But, Preeta, I really think we have the chance to make this right. Good luck. Listen, Preeta, I'm sorry. Okay? I wanted to give you the wedding of your dreams, but at some point, it drifted into my dreams and your father's dreams, and then your father was in my dreams, and in one of them, he was riding a tiger. It was really weird. And then... I'm sorry that I didn't just shut up and listen to what you wanted. What I want is you. It's only ever been that. Going forward, I promise fewer surprises, and I promise more truth. 'Cause honestly, I love you. Will you please take this back? And will you marry me again, but better this time? You know, it wasn't all Thomas and Jerome. I know you had a hand in it, too. You were right from the beginning. A resume is just a piece of paper. You have to give someone a chance to find out what they can do. I agree. Yes, you, um, did a very good job. Thank you, Terence. On that note, I would love to introduce you to Miss Linda Perrybottom. Mr. Dubros. The real owner of the resume. Hello. You must be Terence. Uh, I am. Josephine Pennybaker at the Dorsey says the most wonderful things about you. Oh, she does? It's quite an impressive resume. Um... I guess I'll see you in my office tomorrow, or, um, in Mr. Dubros' office tomorrow. Thank you, Kayla. And we'll see you tomorrow. Thank you, sir. And I won't let you down. Good luck, Terence. All right, I think we actually might've pulled this off, maybe. Oh, definitely. - Champagne. - Mm-hmm. Cheers. Huh? Come here, pussycat. You're ruining the whole day. I'm gonna turn you into a biscuit. Huh? Sorry. Nothing to see here. What the... Maybach music... Uh, Mr. Dubros, I just got a bill for both weddings. That's a joke, right? Well, you know, I, uh, had Terence run some numbers earlier and... it doesn't look good for you. Thank you for choosing the Royal Gate.
