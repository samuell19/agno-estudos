Do not go near him. Has anybody else been there? Good. Show me your hands. Look into my eyes. They are small and white. Have you worked with them? Did you help your mother? Good. Good boy. I'll come home soon... ...but until then you are master of the house. Make sure everything is in order. Understood? Good. and don't forget... Wait. How long have I been here? Which day is today? He can't speak. Close the port! Everything ok at home? No problem with the visitor? Good. Has he left? Is he still there? Where does he sleep? Does he sleep in the barn? Listen carefully. He may not be there anymore. He has to leave. He is not a good person. Do you understand? Give this to your mother. I'll be home soon. Do not forget it. Not even for a second. Or this... This is our secret. Just ours. Remember that. Good boy. Hold on. We leave now. Here! Listen to me. Don't turn around. Don't turn around. Stop! Is the man gone? Hold up your hands. What have you done? What have you done?! What? What? Don't leave. Don't leave! Don't leave. English text: Pettson&Findus
