Dad? Look, Dad, my hands are tied. Dad! Dad, untie my hands! Dad! Dad, please untie my hands, look they are tied. My hands are hurting, please untie them. Dad! Where have you brought me? Please untie my hands! Mom! Where have you brought me, Dad? Dad, untie my hands. Untie them, Dad! Please! What is wrong with you? Let go of me! Where have you brought me? What's wrong with you, Dad? Let me go. Where are you taking me? Hello, sir. Hello. All the tasks you assigned me are done. All the rooms including the study have been set up. In fact, Professor himself set the study. What about the internet and the phone? Sir, I'll set up the connections tomorrow. It won't take time. I told you to do it before my arrival. I reminded you on call as well. You did, sir, but there were some problems yesterday. I'll set up the connections tomorrow. Man, you took an advance for the paint but you didn't paint the roof. Yes, sir. I'll get it done in two days. This side of the house is done. Only the backside is left. Pari! You scared the hell out of me. It's so peaceful in here. This peace is what's haunting me. What do you mean? Nothing. I didn't mean anything. We sold everything... and invested all our savings to get this beautiful place. And now you are saying that this peace is haunting you? Moving in here was a mutual decision. What's bothering you now? Are you upset with me? You know, I can't be upset with you. Not even if I make a mistake? Have you made a mistake or are you about to make one? Pari! Pari... -Mehwish. -Apologize to your dad. Mehwish! What are you waiting for? I said apologize to him. It's okay. We both were just playing and such things happens. Right? Pari is my daughter as well as my best buddy. And buddies do not apologize to each other. -Right, buddy? -Will you please keep quiet? Apologize to your dad right now. Mehwish... Now go to your room. Go. What's wrong, Mehwish? She is just a kid. Wasn't slapping her enough... that you made her apologize as well? THE TEACHINGS OF THE DEVIL Wow. Setting up your own paradise here? Here's some coffee. Drink it if you want to. Why aren't you talking to me? We'll talk in the morning. I have loads of work to do. What's so important that you can't spare two minutes to talk? Not right now, Mehwish. Please. Are you mad at me? I should not have misbehaved with you. I don't know what happens to me sometimes. Look. I am even holding my ears. It won't ever happen again. Forgive me. I told you, Mehwish. We'll talk in the morning. We'll talk in the morning. What's wrong with you, Mehwish? Tell me! What happened, Mehwish? Why are you behaving like this? Now that I am talking to you, you are crying. What's wrong? I have left for Islamabad. Have to receive payment from the publisher. And I'll be meeting Professor on my way back. He helped us get such a beautiful house. I want to thank him in person. By the way, you look really beautiful when you're asleep. Only I know how I have resisted myself. Pari. Are you still sleepy, honey? Come on, it's time for breakfast. Oh! So you won't even talk to me now? Why are you doing this to me? Pari... Come on. Don't throw tantrums. I am your mother for God's sake. If you don't behave yourself, I'll slap you again. Come on, Mom. Let's play. -No, Pari. Not now please. -Please. No. Not now, Pari. I am very tired. I have to set up everything. Pari. Pari. Pari! God is love. God is the eternal and complete love. He takes care of His men and makes them His friends, who look after His creations, and loves them. Tell me, what did the God's messengers do? They used to take care and spread love that's why their teachings... are still alive. The holy saint has said that... the best among you are those, who are kind to each other. The messengers of God spread the same message. My brothers, spread love among each other... and take good care of each other. This is what the messengers taught... and this is exactly what God, and His Holy Prophet loved the most. Anger! Anger is what's destroying you, spit it out. Will everything be okay if I do so? Everything is already okay. How are you, Abdullah? Getting signs from God? You'll find the path too. Have patience. One more, darling. Just one more. Let go, you pervert! Let go of me! If you don't want to kiss, then don't. At least don't hit me, darling. Hey! Show yourself! Why are you troubling me? Face me. Abdullah! Abdullah! Abdullah... Shehram. Shehram? Who are you? What do you want? I've been observing you since morning. Why are you standing in front of my house? I am talking to you. Answer me! This kid is the devil. Throw her out of your house. -Throw her out. She will destroy you. -What are you saying? She will destroy you! Throw her out of your house! Throw her... out of your house. She will destroy you! Throw her out! She will destroy you! She will... Leave! Preach this nonsense to someone else. Throw her out! You bastard! Leave, right now! -She will destroy you. -Get out of here! So you refuse to leave? Wait right here! Shehram. This kid is the devil. Throw her out of your house. She will destroy you! Throw her out of your house! I pray that... Pari? Bastard. He went away, but left me with nightmares. What are you doing here? I was looking for you. What are you doing here? And why do you look upset? Nothing. What's wrong, Mehwish? You've been behaving strangely since we moved here. Are you okay? Mehwish? -Is everything okay? -It's nothing. Mehwish. Where do you think you are going? I am talking to you. Why do you even bother? When you refuse to take any efforts, why do you bother? I have told you so many times to offer your prayers. And if you don't want to do it, at least ask Pari to do it. I told you so many times to get this home blessed. I never asked you to do it. A couple of children from the nearby mosque could've done it. But you had issues with that as well. And today, you crossed all the limits! A stranger comes to our house and says that our daughter is the devil and you go to bed, sleeping peacefully as if nothing happened? -Do you want some water? -What? Here, have some. Then you can scold me. Shehram, what's going on? Why is this happening to us? It's driving me crazy. Mehwish! What's this? What kind of a scar is this? You don't know how this happened? I just noticed it. -We should go to a doctor. -Yeah. By the way, you are getting natural tattoos. Nobody can beat you in being cheesy. It's my cheesiness that has held our marriage for so long. Everything will be fine. Shehram! Shehram! Mehwish! Are you there? Where the hell is everyone! Sir? How come you are here at this hour? Where is your car? I... was out since this afternoon. It takes an hour to reach your place from the city. So I thought that I'd spend the afternoon with you guys and leave before sunset. Okay, sir. "Okay, sir?" It was as if the devil's force didn't want me to be here. When I left, my driver started throwing up. I took him to the hospital. It was the dengue virus. I got him admitted there, informed his family members. And by the time I left the hospital, it was already evening. I was driving on my own. On my way here, two of my car's tires got punctured. I couldn't take it anymore. I thought I would leave my car, go back home, and then inform you guys that I won't be coming over. You should have gone back. There was no need to take the trouble. What are you talking about? Don't interfere. What was I saying? Sir, about the puncture. Sir, how about we continue this interesting conversation inside? -Please come in. -I said whatever I had to. Now take me inside. How are you? Oh, I had such a terrible day... Oh! Who is this angel? Hello, my dear. How old are you, Pari? I... I'll bring the cake. What is this? What is all this? Shehram, are you on drugs? What is this? Why are you worried? I ask because you are celebrating her birthday today while the date mentioned is long gone. Why is the date 6-6-2016? I agree that I am old and that the society is moving fast. Sorry, I forgot to check before buying the cake. No problem. Doesn't matter what's written. We know the truth, right? If... on my next birthday, you bring a cake with 1990 written on it, won't change anything, right? Come on, let's cut the cake. Hurry up! It was very difficult for me to be here. Let's sing the birthday song now. Come on! Pari. Come on, dear. First, blow off the candles. Oh, I am sorry. I have diabetes. Give it to your parents. Give it to your mom... What happened? Shehram, I know power cuts are a common occurrence in Karachi. Didn't know it happened here as well. Give me five minutes, I'll switch on the generator. Okay, go ahead. Be careful. Sit here. Pari, sit with sir. Your mom and I will be right back. Let's go, Mehwish. I am fine right here, Shehram. I might need some help. What's wrong with you? Let's go. Pari, sit with sir, okay? Mehwish... come on, let's go. By the way, have you ever thought of cleaning this room? Hurry up, Shehram. Hold this. By the way, which room is the generator connected to? Why are you sweating in such a cold weather? Are you alright? Just hurry up. Pari? Pari? Pari, my dear? Pari! Pari! Shehram! Shehram! Pari... Shehram! Shehram! Shehram! Who is it? Shehram! Shehram... What is taking so long? Hurry up. -Hello, Doctor. -Hello. How is he feeling? It was a minor attack. We have given him the necessary treatment but we'll have to shift him to Islamabad. And the ambulance? Those things are being taken care of. -Can we meet him? -Yes. Pari, stay here. We'll be right back. Mehwish, come here. Mehwish. Tell me the truth. Who is Pari? Whose child is she? The truth... Professor! Professor! Professor! The body Made of dust The body... Made of dust The body Made of dust What did he mean? Whose daughter is Pari? What's wrong, Shehram? What are you talking about? Is Pari my daughter? Yes or no? Oh, devotee Listen to the Omnipotent His voice Is silent In the things present around Oh, Allah! Oh, Allah! In the things present around Restrain your actions Try to listen to Him Body made of dust, Don't turn into fire Body made of dust, Don't turn into fire You're made of dust Body made of dust, Don't turn into fire The body Made of dust Here, give it to me. Can you see someone behind you? I can see everything clearly. -Look over there. -What is it? Why are you hitting me? What is it? Can you see somebody over there? Is that a rhetorical question? Can you see it or not? Go easy on the drugs, bro. They're driving you crazy. What do you want? Shehram! Mom! Open the door, Mom! Mehwish! Mehwish! Mehwish! Mehwish! Mehwish? Pari? Pari. Pari? Shehram, wake up! I can't find Pari. I checked everywhere, she is not in her room either. Please do something. Pari! Pari! Grandma used to tell me That empty houses Are haunted by spirits The ones that are not visible Often, when I'm alone... I see somebody I don't understand What he wants to tell me He is scary Pari! Dad! Pari... He's very naughty He doesn't appear to be human Perhaps he's an evil spirit Grandma used to tell me Grandma used to tell me -Shehram, there is-- -What happened, Mehwish? Shehram, something... Wait, Shehram. Listen to me. Where were you? You're a good girl, aren't you? Mehwish! You should receive it. Yes, I'll talk to them. Bye. I am going to the market. I'll bring some breakfast and medicines for you. Do you need anything else? Pari, do you want anything? Look after your mother. Okay? Call me if you need anything else. Okay? Shehram. You'll be fine. Okay. Do take care of your mother, Pari. Listen to me. You'll need my help. There is... There is something in your house. Your daughter... she is not yours. You'll need my help or else your life will fall apart. Listen to me, you need to hear this. Your life is in danger. You'll need my help. Leave me alone. I am warning you, you'll need my help. There is something in your house. It will destroy your family. Please go away. Listen to me, you'll be ruined. That girl is not your daughter. Please go away. I thought of talking to you a million times. I consoled myself that you will understand. You want to know the truth, Shehram? You really want to know the truth about Pari? Last year, in January you went abroad for your book launch. Pari. Pari. Pari. Pari. I kept calling out to her over and over again. I thought she was doing this to annoy me. Pari. Pari. Our Pari had died, Shehram. Pari! I thought of calling the doctor or an ambulance. But the doctor would have just confirmed what I already knew. My only child was dead. My only daughter was dead, Shehram. How did I find the book that had a way of bringing back the dead to life? Why did I surrender myself to ungodly ways? Why did a mother's love win over a woman's faith? I don't know. After losing my child, my life... I had nothing to lose. Our daughter is the devil. God's curse is falling upon us. She is the devil. Hell is calling out to me. I can't offer prayers anymore. I can't take God's name. Mehwish! Mehwish! How did this... Mehwish! It's a severe head injury, Shehram. Her brain is in a state of shock. Its showing zero activity. We're doing our best. If she doesn't regain consciousness in the next 48 hours we'll have to put her on a ventilator. Try to finish the work on time! Are you alright, sir? Who is that man in the picture? Sir, he was one of the board of directors of this hospital. He used to be the richest man in town. He didn't have any family except an eight year old son, who had eye cancer. The boy went through a lot expensive treatments but nothing worked. He used to live nearby. Have you seen that house on the hills? In the middle of the jungle? He used to live there. He was so desperate to get his son cured that he even consulted a sorcerer. The treatment took his son's life and in the state of anger, he killed the sorcerer. After that day, his house became a living hell for him. So he abandoned everything and started living as a heretic. There is a shrine nearby, you will definitely find him there. I have heard that a family has recently moved into that house. -Listen. -Yes? Where is that shrine? Oh, Allah! The wounds Of the soul Are very Deep The words of criticism Leave behind wounds That are very deep Allah, the world fights Against self-deception The world Goes to your shrine With a lot of hope Oh, Allah! Oh, Allah! Oh, Allah! Oh, Allah! Oh, Allah! Oh, Allah! Oh, Allah! Oh, Allah! Oh, Allah! We're engulfed in problems, Allah We're engulfed in problems, Allah We only seek your blessings, Allah We only seek your blessings, Allah Allah, the world is engulfed in sorrows Allah, the world is engulfed in sorrows The world goes to your shrine with hopes The world goes to your shrine with hopes Oh, Allah! Oh, Allah! Oh, Allah! Oh, Allah! Oh, Allah! Oh, Allah! Who are you looking for, son? You won't find Abdullah here. From the earth we come, to the earth we shall return. Who are you and what do you know about me? From the earth we come, to the earth we shall return. The world goes to your shrine with hopes Did you offer your prayers? I think it is time. Oh, Allah! Oh, Allah! Oh, Allah! Oh, Allah! Oh, Allah! This kid is the devil. Throw her out of your house. -Throw her out of your house. -What are you saying? She'll destroy you! -Leave, right now! -She'll destroy you! Throw her out! Oh, Allah! Who is Pari? Oh, Allah! Whose child is she? Allah! Let go of me, Dad. Where are you taking me? That girl is not your daughter. Get me out of here, Dad! Dad, please! I'll suffocate here! Dad! Untie me! Get me out of here! Have you lost your mind, Dad? I am choking down here. Untie me! What are you doing? Please get me out of here, Dad. I'll die! Dad! You have made a huge mistake! You think you can defeat me? Make a fresh start Make a fresh start Make a fresh start Make a fresh start My Lord Forgive me My Lord Forgive me You didn't understand The ways of the Lord Oh, Lord! Oh, Allah! May he forgive you You've been punished Your soul has been hurt It echoes everywhere From the earth we come, to the earth we shall return. Did you offer your prayers? I think it is time. Oh, Allah! Oh, Allah! Oh, Allah! "We belong to Allah and to Him we shall return. Allah is the greatest! Glory be to You, Allah, and all praises are due to You. Blessed is Your name and none is worthy of worship but You. Allah is the greatest! Praise is only for Allah, Lord of the universe. You are the most compassionate and merciful. The Master of the Judgment Day. You alone we worship... and to You alone we pray for help. Lead us along the straight path, the path of those You have blessed. Who have not deserved Your wrath, nor gone astray. Allah is the greatest! Oh, Allah, send grace and honor on Muhammad and on the true followers of Muhammad, just as you sent grace and honor on Ibrahim and the true followers of Ibrahim. You are the most praiseworthy, the Exalted. Peace and mercy of Allah be on you." Pari! My child! My child...
