Yes, Miss? My chart for today. The numbers can't be right. I must have made a mistake. What can I do for you my good man? Is this Mona Harrison's place? Yes. This is Miss Harrison's residence. But the service entrance is .. - Is that her? Just what do you wish, sir? I wish 431 dollars C.O.D. 431 dollars. - C.O.D.? What is the trouble, Fields? A box from .. Hector Rose. From the Palisades Studio. So, he finally decided to send the dress fabrics I ordered. This person wishes to collect 431 dollars. Do you mean to say that Hector dared to send them C.O.D.? Yes, ma'am. I guess he wanted his money right quick. I'll make out a check for you. The service entrance is this way. - Okay, buddy. Okay. Hurry, Fields. What is it, Miss Harrison? It is Hector Rose. Oh! May the saints preserve us. Blood. Why should anybody do a thing like this? I presume I should call the police. The police? No. Let's not call the police yet. But Miss Harrison. He is dead. I know. I'll call Joe Medford. But Mr Medford is a .. is a reporter. Please .. let me handle this. And don't talk about it. Please. Go inside at once. Medford. Oh, hello Mona. What is on your mind? Right now? Look honey, it can't be that important. What's up? I can't tell you over the phone, Joe. But I've got to see you right away. I need you. Believe me. Look, honey. I've been waiting to hear that last line for a long time. I'll be right over. Here is that City Hall script. I'm ducking out for a bit if you don't mind. I do mind. - This is important. I know. That glamour puss is always important. How many times as week must you interview the girl? This is not an interview. She needs me desperately. Why doesn't she call a cop? A cop? Why, she needs someone with a great big brain. Serious, Emmett. She is terribly upset about something. And it could be a story. Why not stop kidding yourself, Joe? She's just giving you the old come-on. Movie stars are not for newspaper mugs. Forget about those plush-lined swimming pools. Well, Mona's is lined with ermine. Oh, Joe. What's the matter, baby? - I don't know what to do, Joe. Oh well, that is why I am here. You'll hep me, won't you? You know I always help poor helpless women. Sit down baby, and tell me what it is all about. Well, yesterday I had a big battle at the studio with Hector Rose. You mean that male costume whipper-upper? An unpleasant character. You want me to take a sock at him? No. Listen, Joe. I .. My numerology chart for today warned me to be careful. It's all tragedy. See? Now look baby. Quit sparring. This is Joe. Remember? This numbers game of yours and your fight with Hector Rose can't be serious. Unless you killed the guy. No, I didn't. I didn't kill him. But he is dead. His body is out by the service porch. Yeah. That's a nice place for him. What? It came C.O.D. In a packing case. This I have got to see, and even if I do I won't believe it. Working in a kitchen with a body lying just outside the door. I don't like it. Nothing in the book says I've got to get dinner with a dead body under my window. If he is going to bury that thing on the premises I am packing my bags. Three bullet holes. A very dead citizen. You've got to do something, Joe. You have got to get rid of it. Don't be frightened, baby. After all, you didn't kill him. No. But somebody killed him and sent his body here. Yeah. Now who would want to do that? I don't know. What are all those bolts of cloth doing here? Bolts of .. Please Joe. Take it away. Please. The newspapers. They'll tear me to pieces if it's found here. Now look. Don't worry about the cops or the newspapers. Just leave everything to Joey. You know I wouldn't do anything to hurt you. Then you will help me, Joe? Sure, baby. Sure. Now, you had netter come inside and .. Try to rest if you can. I'll do anything you say. Careful. I might take you up on that sometime. Sure it is on the level, boss. An exclusive. And get this. The corpse came C.O.D. Yeah, in a packing case with a lot of dress goods. Send a photographer here right away. I want to get some pictures before the police arrive. Mona is prostrated and .. I'll call you right back. As I was saying, Mona is prostrated and hysterical. Operate? Police station. Emergency. Hello, Sarge. I want to talk to Lieutenant Wilson. Mr Medford. Joe Medford. Yeah. I said I wanted to talk to Lieutenant Wilson. Yes, Sarge? Oh. He is over at Palisades? Okay. I will call him there. So, I am to leave everything to you? Now wait a minute. You promised to protect me. - I'm protecting you. You called the police. I can't let that happen. Now look, Mona. You didn't think I was going to hide that body, did you? The police would discover it sooner or later and assume you're guilty. Can't you understand? - But Joe. Quiet down while I call Wilson. No, you mustn't. - Why not? You know Wilson. He's always hanging around the studio. He's a fan of yours and he'll give you all the breaks. Is it your fault if a fool with a warped sense of humor ships you a corpse? Wilson will know you didn't plug the guy and ship him to yourself. Will he? - Sure he will. But my fans. They'll think all kinds of things. Look, darling. When the facts are known everybody will be on your side. You know that everybody loves you. Even me. Why, you will carry thing off with the dignity of a Bernhardt. I am afraid, Joe. Palisades Studios reception desk. Hello, Mr Medford. Lieutenant Wilson? Yes. I believe he's on the lot. I will try to locate him. Here he is now. For you, Lieutenant. Joe Medford. Thanks, Peggy. Hello Joe. What's on your mind? Huh? This isn't a gag, is it Joe? Okay. Don't touch anything. I will be right over. Thanks. Hello Lieutenant. What's new? Well .. the same old sixes and sevens, Mr Edwards. Be seeing you later. Have you seen Hector Rose? - No I haven't, Mr Edwards. He hasn't come in yet. Mr Edwards, I sing. And I thought if I had a .. Mr Edwards is a very busy man. He is President of the studio, you know. Maybe later. I've been listening to that for weeks. Don't lose patience. Archie Leech sat in that chair for a year. Archie Leech? What does he do? He seems to be doing fine. Since he changed his name to Cary Grant. Hiya, Larry. Did I get here first? Yeah. The cops haven't arrived yet. We never miss, do we Joe. You find the stiffs and I beat the other papers to the pics. That's right. I never call the opposition. You sure you got enough equipment this trip? You know me, Joe. I am a specialist. I always bring along everything. You never can tell when you are going to run into something. That's right. You never can tell. There is the box and there is the body. You get busy. I will be inside. Okay, Joe. He is a good-looking guy. Well. That's what you get for fooling around with women. Take me for instance. I am a married man with four kids. I wouldn't foot around with the best looking .. Hello, doll. Want your picture in the paper? Oh no. Miss Mona wouldn't like it. No, but the customers would. Come on. You are about to be posed by one of the best still men .. In a town that's crawling with still men. Well. Yes, sir? Joe Medford sent for us. Is he here? Yes, sir. Will you come in please. Hello Joe. - Hello Lieutenant. How do you do, Miss Harrison. You know Dave Short. - Sure. Where's the body? - Out back. I'll show you. I won't be a minute. Still. That is the body you are supposed to photograph. No this one. I know. Just getting a little cheesecake to go with it. Hiya, Lieutenant. How's about one of you with the stiff? I suppose your paper is on the street with the story already? You know I have a job to do. I gave you all the breaks. I could've called any old cop you know. - Well, that's big of you. Sometime, suppose you try calling police first instead of your paper, huh? Make a memo of that. Felice. Go inside. Hey, Jeeves. How about one of you like you're opening the box? Oh no. Missed him. That guy sure is camera shy. How about it, Lieutenant? One with you beside the body? No more pictures until the homicide crew arrive. I ought to toss you in the clink for taking what you got. You want me to take the plates from him, Mark? What's the matter with you people around here? Nobody wants their picture in the paper? Why not let him take a shot of you? Publicity never hurt a cop. That's what promotions are made of. Alongside that corpse you ought to look pretty good. I thought you wanted to soft-pedal this on account of Mona Harrison. Well, you know I can't soft-pedal a murder. But I am going to see to it than Mona isn't hurt. And you're going to help me. Well, that is very noble of us. You sure nobody has touched anything? - Not a thing. It's all yours. Rush that stuff down to the office, will you. Sure. Oh .. it went off. Why, you .. Don't you touch me now. I'm only doing my job the same as you are. Get set, baby. Remember Sarah Bernhardt. Wasn't there a transfer company name on the truck? No, sir. I'm sure there was not any lettering of any kind on the truck. It was just a plain, very old vehicle. Was that right, Miss Harrison? - Yes, Lieutenant. Didn't you think it odd that the goods weren't delivered by a studio truck? I didn't think about it at the time. The C.O.D. charge did puzzle me. But I thought it was one of Hector's usual nasty little tricks. Because of an argument we'd had. What did the delivery man look like? He was just a .. Just a transfer man in his late 40s or 50s. Can you describe him? I am afraid not sir. Delivery persons all look so much alike. That's great. Well, he collected a C.O.D. of four hundred and some odd dollars. Where's the receipt? Well, I .. - She .. Didn't get any receipt. She just signed his book. That's all. You mean you gave him that much money and didn't get a receipt? Yes. She was all excited about getting the material and .. And well, she gave him a check. That's a receipt, isn't it? You said you had a fight with Hector Rose. An argument. Not a fight. Oh. I see. Well, the packing case and everything in it must be impounded as evidence. Everything is there just as it arrived? Yes, Lieutenant. No-one touched it. It's all there. You didn't touch anything? No. Nothing. I called Joe as soon as Fields had pried open the case. I suppose it didn't occur to you to call the police. Lay off her. She's been through enough. Okay. Look, Miss Harrison. I will protect you as much as I can. But you have got to cooperate with me. Thank you. Well the thing to do is to locate the truck driver .. And find out who ordered him to pick up that box. You don't mind if I call the fingerprint expert .. And the coroner first do you, Mona darling? Where is the telephone? - This way, please. You did okay, baby. Well, I've got to beat it. Joe, you can't leave me here with that detective. I got to, honey. It's important. But what if he .. what if he accuses me of the murder? Remember that picture you made, Homicide House? When a detective accused you of being a killer? Yes but that was just a picture. What did you say to him? - I said "prove it, copper". That's it. Give Wilson the same line. It will confuse him. Hello Peggy. Heard the news, Joe? - Heard it? I printed it. I suppose the mob is in Lance Fowler's office. With their knives sharpened. There are 971 reporters in there trying to pump him. Want to go in? I don't go for crowds. I don't want to see him anyway. Incidentally, do you know anything that I should know that he doesn't know? If you mean about the murder .. no. Okay. Let me through will you. Come on, Fowler. Give out. She fought with him, didn't she? What time was Rose last seen alive? - That I can answer. About 8 o'clock last night. He worked late. Now boys, if you will just give us a little time to prepare a statement. Time, he wants? Ha-ha. We have a deadline. - Where is Mona now? Quit stalling. Well. If it isn't little Rosemary. The Daily Register sob-sister. Well, on you that basket looks good. Get me out of this, Joe Medford. There's no hurry. Your paper won't be on the street until tomorrow morning. Gives you plenty of time to rewrite my stuff. Ooh. I hadn't realised you had such pretty ankles. Forget my ankles. Get me out of here. No. Never forget an ankle. Besides, I can't help you. Union rules. I'll have to call a maintenance man. I could kill you for this, Joe Medford. - Now, now. Temper, temper. Please get me out of here. Alright, troublesome. But I really should get Larry to get a shot of you before we go. But just because I love you, here we go. I might have known I'd find you snooping around poor old Hector's desk. Snooping around poor old Hector's. I guess you're looking for paper clips? Why aren't you with the rest of the mob in Fowler's office? And why aren't you? Say. Did you find anything of interest before I got here? Because you might as well tell me. You are scooped anyway. Okay, I am scooped. But the big scoop is when they find the murderer. You have something there sweetheart, and who do you suppose is going to find him? Him? Or Her? Tell me. Did your blond, cinema heartthrob kill the dressmaker herself .. Or did she hire someone to do the job? Well, this is off the record. She killed him and had him shipped to herself. Just as soon as she knocks off one more she's going to use them for bookends. Any further questions? Yes. Yes, I've got a question. Look, Joseph. I like you. - Hmm? Even though you do have a weakness for 2-headed blonds. Why can't we work together on this? You with the afternoons and me with the morning stuff. We could beat all the other newspapers to the punch. We'd make a great team. What do you say? Uhuh. Sounds rather interesting. But you see, I have the inside track with Mona. So why should I cut you in, sweetheart? Since you fell for that baby-faced witch you've had your eyes full of stardust. She is making a sap out of you. And of course you wouldn't make a sap out of me? Oh, no. Not until you got a moment alone with a telephone. Thank you Rosemary but I am playing this one alone. Don't you trust anybody? Very seldom. Especially newspaper dames that happen to be pretty. Joseph, I didn't know you cared. - I don't. Well, that makes me very happy. You, you, you .. I'm sure you know the word I had in mind. Take it easy on Mona. That is all I ask. That's all he asks. Joe. Hello, Lance. - Where have you been? Why? Mitchell Edwards wants to see you. - Oh, does he? By a strange coincidence I was about to drop in on him. Hi, Mitch. You want to see me? Yep. Mona called. She told me you'd been at the house. - That's right. What do you think, Joe? Do you think she killed him? Do you? I don't know. She and Hector fought like a couple of Prima-donnas. That is not for publication you understand. I know you think as much of Mona as I do. Maybe more. What do you know about this Hector Rose? You brought him out here from New York, didn't you? Yes. He was a jewelry and dress designer. But that has nothing to do with things now. It's Mona I am worried about. She isn't strong enough to stand this pitiless publicity. Mona is as strong as a horse. Lance, you are holding out on her. You boys are worried about something else. Come. Give. There is nothing to give, Joe. Yes? "Lieutenant Wilson to see you." Alright. Send him in. Now don't mention Mona unless Wilson brings her name up. Hello, Fowler. - Shush. Hello darling. Have I missed anything? For a keyhole expert, that is practically an admission of defeat. You should know, with all the experience you have. - You. Lieutenant Wilson. I was hoping I would see you. I am certainly glad you are on this case. You are so fair. You never play favorites with it comes to the press breaks. Don't look at me. I didn't ask her in. Well, what are the latest developments? Have you arrested Mona Harrison yet? No, Miss Durant. And I must ask you to leave. I'd like to talk to these gentlemen alone. You mean I have to leave and he is going to stay? Medford is a material witness. I don't care if he is an accomplice. And he probably is. If he stays I stay. My paper is more important than his. Please, Miss Durant. I have got enough trouble. Oh Lieutenant, I have been meaning to tell you. I'd like to write a story on the way you work. I've always been fascinated by the police. I had a police dog once. Alright. You can stay. But hold the story until I give a green light. Of course, Lieutenant. - Never trust a woman. Particularly this one. We'll do anything we can to help you, Lieutenant. But you understand .. Look Edwards, we'll get to the bottom of things .. As quickly and with as little scandal as possible. So far, here are the facts. First, Hector Rose didn't check out of the studio last night. That means he was killed here. Second. The killer used a small calibre pistol, a .32. The size a woman might carry in her handbag. Third. Mona Harrison had a fitting with Rose yesterday afternoon .. Which ended in an argument. What are you trying to do, pin it on Mona? No. I am telling you how things add up. The packing case came from Rose's store room shortly after Mona left the lot. I'd like to have a look at that room. Certainly, Lieutenant. You show him the way, Lance. - Alright. It looks kinda bad for your little Mona, doesn't it. I'd like to know where you were last night. You wouldn't like it at all. The box was right over here last night when we left. Yes. It was just about here. Mr Rose had labelled himself after his disagreement with Miss Harrison. He had, had he? Yes. He was very happy about sending the material C.O.D. He would be. What did they fight about? Go ahead. Tell him. They argued over the fit of one of her gowns and finally she slapped him. Slapped him? Was that all? Well, he tripped over some bolts of material and fell down. It hurt his dignity. It's all very simple. Hector tried to return the slap and of course the girl had to defend herself. So she shot him. Try making anything out of that in print and .. You'll have to defend yourself from me, sweetheart. I've he been looking forward to that, darling. Who are you? This is Maxwell Kenyon, Lieutenant. He is, or was, Mr Rose's personal representative and business manager. So, what are you doing here? Protecting my client's interests. A dead man doesn't have many interests, does he? Mr Rose .. dead? Yeah, murdered. News hit the streets about an hour ago or can't you read? If you didn't know, what are you doing here rummaging through his desk? Yeah. Like a common criminal. He looks suspicious if you ask me. I didn't ask you. You'd better talk, mister. - But there's nothing to talk about. I have a right to examine the contents of Mr Rose's desk. I hold his power of attorney. Naturally, I take charge of his estate. And naturally you will answer some questions. Any time, Lieutenant. Okay. Don't leave town. I haven't the slightest intention of leaving town. What is the idea of letting him go? I can pick him up anytime. Suppose he was looking for something? Something Hector Rose might have hidden. What, for instance? - I don't know. If we knew that we'd be a lot closer to knowing who the killer was. That's nice logic. But suppose you leave the detecting end of this to me. You get in my way. Oh, don't look so unhappy, Joseph. You can get in my way. I will tell him when he comes in. Peggy. Slip me hector Rose's home address quick, will you. You know I'm not supposed to give out things like that, Joe. Not even for dinner at Ciro's? Ciro's? Well, that is different. Here you are, Joe. - Thanks. See you in the bar at seven. Seven? That will hardly give me time to dress. Never mind dressing. You'd look luscious it to me in an old beaten-down bath towel. Ciro's. And he says never mind dressing. Oh. Well, hello. I was just .. Saying to Peggy that .. - Yeah. We heard you. How about buying me a cocktail, Joseph? - Sure honey. Anytime. Any other time. I got to go back to the office now. Wilson will buy you one. See you later. Will you take a rain-check, Miss Durant? I am overdue at headquarters. What have I got that makes men avoid me so eagerly? Men. Ha. Excuse me. I sing. Congratulations. Will you wait for me. Forever, ma'am. Thank you. - I'll turn around. Joseph. Hello, Sarge. Send a car and an ambulance over to Hector Rose's bungalow in North Canyon. Somebody is being killed. Hurry. Joe. Hey. What's the idea of prowling around here? Darling. - What's the gag? I was so worried when I heard you fighting. Worried? You worried about me? Yes, you big lug. Are you hurt? What happened? I am not quite sure. Is he dead? I don't know. Let's have a look. Well, he is alive. But somebody gave him a terrific beating. You certainly did. What's that? Oh. It's Mona's check. The one she gave to the corpse? I'll take charge of that if you don't mind. Kenyon, huh? Did you find this on him? Yeah. Well, it sort-of blew out of his pocket. While you were holding your breath, no doubt. He needs an ambulance. It is on the way. I ordered it when they started fighting. What were you trying to do, murder the man? I didn't do it. Someone else worked him over. Who, Miss Durant? I suppose she hit you on the head too? Listen, Wilson. I'll tell you all I know about this business. I came here looking for .. Well, anyway. Kenyon tried to brain me with a heavy piece of statuary. I tackled him. He hit me on the head with a chair and that's all I remember. Now, let's have your version. Well, I .. heard them fighting and then I heard voices upstairs. Voices? Then someone else was in this room after I was put away. Maybe you talk in your sleep. I didn't say a word. I didn't even whisper. No? Well, maybe you'll say a few words now. Why'd you come here in the first place? - Well, I was looking for a clue. We all knew that Kenyon was looking for something belonging to Hector. Clue-hunting again, huh? Look Joe, I have warned you before. Clues are my department. But I found a swell clue. The check. What does it mean? It means that Kenyon collected for that C.O.D. That he got the check from the truck driver .. That your bright boys aren't able to find. It could mean he's the murderer. Not necessarily. As Rose's business manager he might have picked up the check at his office desk. Impossible. We went through Hector's desk before .. Kenyon got there. Oh. You did, did you? Look, Miss Durant. You and Joe are going to stop playing detective right now. Stick to straight reporting .. Before you get snarled up in something too dangerous for you to handle. Yeah. Well, maybe you are right. Sure he is. It's as plain as the lump on your head. Good. Now that we understand each other, get out and let me go to work. Wait a minute. - Hello, Dave. Where is Lieutenant Wilson? - Inside. Is that ambulance for him? Unfortunately no. He's his usual hale and hearty self. And twice as bossy. You know I could be persuaded to buy one or more cocktails at this very moment. That sounds lovely. But at this moment I have to phone in my story about how you beat up Kenyon. You can read about it in the bulldog editions, sweetheart. Imagine you, the brute type. "He's got a warm kiss." "But a cold heart." "A fond and fulsome caress." "Ah yes." "This is that thing called love, I guess." Gee, this is great stuff, Joe. But can you afford it? Don't fret, Peggy. It's on the expense account under a heading "investigation." I knew it. Any time a newspaper man invites me to dinner he wants something. What is on your mind? That publicity director of yours. What do you know about him? Lance Fowler? Well, he is a funny guy. Sort-of a lone wolf. Not your kind of wolf, Joe. You don't think he killed Hector Rose? Why not? Well, they were friends. Always in huddles. What about? I don't know. Once I heard them talking about a shipment of some sort. Mr Rose seemed worried about it. Joe. I have been looking everywhere for you. Mona, you shouldn't be out tonight. I couldn't help it. I had to talk to you. You said you'd call me. I haven't had a minute. I've been working on some new angles. Angles, darling? Or curves? Would you mind if I joined you for a moment? We would be charmed, Miss Harrison. Thanks. Have you .. Had dinner? - Yes, thanks. Telephone call, Mr Medford. The booth. - Thank you. Well, if you girls will excuse me. Peggy, has Joe told you anything about these new angles? Hello Joe. - How are you? That was Mitchell Edwards. He wants me to come to the studio right away. What for? - He didn't say. Who is the hotrod with Mona? I don't know. I think I have seen him around the studio. Thanks for the dance, Miss Harrison. - Thank you. I enjoyed it. You are Joe Medford of The Enquirer, aren't you? Yeah. Who are you? Be careful what you write about Miss Harrison. If you want to keep on writing. Where did you pick up the fugitive? I don't remember who first introduced me. His name is Rudy Frasso. He is always around the clubs. Well, he'd better button his lip or he won't be around much longer. Waiter. Check please. You are not leaving? - I have to. That was a business call. Hello, Captain. - Why thanks, Mr Medford. [ Gunshots! ] What's that? - They're shooting an escape scene. Oh. My nerves. You're dropping like a couple of sacks of wet cement. Once more. And please gentlemen, show a little more life when you die. Carol. We will have to replace that actor. Take 43 coming up. - Okay. What's on your mind, Mitch? Sorry to get you over here at night Joe, but .. I have some further information on Hector Rose. Thanks. You don't mind I take it along tonight, do you? Incidentally, what kind of shipments did Hector Rose receive here at the studio? Shipments? Oh, dress materials, yard goods, bolts of cloth. Why? Just a hunch of mine. I want to go through that storeroom where that stuff is stored. Now. Well, the police have searched the place from top to bottom. Well, I might find something they have overlooked. Okay. Here is the master key. Thanks. Want to go along? No. I have a call in from New York. Be careful, Joe. - Don't worry. I'm bulletproof. Not you again. Oh Joseph. I am so glad it is only you. I thought you were going to stick to straight reporting. I suppose you are here for a new girdle? Look! Someone else was in the room. - I will see who it was. All by myself. No! Joseph. Let me out of here. Joseph, Let me out! Working rather late, aren't you Lance? Lance. What is the matter with you? Joe. Well don't look at me like that. I didn't kill him. But I just heard you talking to him. You didn't hear him answer, did you? I thought you wanted to look over Hector Rose's layout. I did. You didn't follow me by any chance, did you? Certainly not. I couldn't get Lance on the Dictograph so I came here to see what was wrong. Are you calling the police? - Later. Give me the desk. Hello, Emmett? Joe Medford. Send Larry Massey over to Palisades right away. There has been another killing. Lance Fowler. Director of publicity. Stabbed in the back with a fancy letter opener. And listen, Emmett. Don't peep to a soul. I got the opposition locked up in a nice cosy closet. Yeah. Call you later. Joseph! Let me out of here, Joseph! Joseph! Another murder. More bad publicity. You wouldn't take over publicity for us, would you? No thanks. What are you looking for? Anything that will give me a lead. This must be Fowler's special list. His bookie. Hector Rose. Frasso. Rudy Frasso. So that is the guy that danced with Mona tonight. Ever heard of him? Yes. I have met him. Lance introduced us. Frasso was selling jewelry. - Hot stuff? Let's just say it was so cheap I wasn't interested. That is good enough for me. I will just keep this for future reference. Do you think there's a tie-up between this fellow Frasso and the murders? I can tell you better when I check a few things. In the meantime I'll get out of here .. When my photographer gets here and grabs some pictures. But the police? Look, Mitch. Nobody knows a thing about this but the killer and us. That's how I want it for a few hours. - What about Miss Durant? Let her stay in the closet. She just loves closets. That is enough, Larry. Pack up and beat it. Okay Joe. There is one sure thing about this killing. Only someone Fowler new pretty well .. Could get behind him with a pig-sticker like that in his hand. Hey, Joe. My pictures. That Rosemary dame. She snatched my plate case. Rosemary? Oh, no you don't! Give me those plates! - No. I will not. Hey. What is the idea of kissing a dishonest newspaper woman? Don't you have no ethics? Rush that stuff to the office. Never mind my ethics. Okay. Let me know who wins the wrestling match. Okay. Now let's see. Where were we? I remember. Don't you ever touch me again, you collaborator! Now, baby. And don't call me baby! Mona is your baby. Okay, Butch. You wanted to work as a team, didn't you? Alright, let's do it. Nobody knows about this latest murder so if you want to play along .. I can put my finger on the killer by tomorrow noon. I have a hot idea. But not hot enough. My newspaper doesn't go to bed for two hours. I am going to bust this story wide open. Now sweetheart, you have got to give me a chance. This means a lot to both of us. Yes. It means you will scoop me again. I wouldn't trust you if I had an atomic bomb in each hand. Is that the way to talk to the man who is going to marry you? Me, marry you? Why you .. - Come on. Edward has offered me Fowler's job tonight. And when the killer is captured, then I can stop being a newspaper mug. There is no reason under the sun why I can't settle down and get married. If the right girl comes along. Why, you cold-blooded conniving creep. You probably killed Fowler yourself just to get his job. Hey. Hey, sweetheart. Hey, Rosemary. Why don't you answer me? If you don't I won't sleep a wink. Joseph. Hmm. It can't be heaven. You are here. Easy. You may have a concussion. What did you hit me with, a cleaver? I didn't know you were hit until an hour ago. The night watchman found you and called the police. They just brought you here. The police? Fowler? How long have I been out? Long enough for me to write about the new murder from every angle. I didn't think that even you would crown me to make news for your paper. I didn't do it. Honest, Joseph. Why don't we quit fighting and work together like you said? You know, I kinda go for that line you've been giving me. Oh, you do? Uhuh. You might have been killed, Joseph. She is right. You will get it eventually if you don't stop trying play detective. How do you feel? Grand. Just grand. Who slugged you? I didn't see. You know, it's funny that you happen to be on the spot .. Every time someone is slugged or murdered. What were you doing at the studio last night? I was looking for the hook-up between Hector Rose and Lance Fowler. The guy that killed him was going through Rose's storeroom last night. Oh? Did you find some evidence or just adding two and two? What's the matter? Anyone touched my clothes since I've been here? Why? Lose something? No. Just my cigarettes. Here. Thanks. As I was saying. Rose and Fowler were killed by the same guy. Why don't you find that truck driver that delivered Hector's body? He might be able to identify the murderer. Still the "big clue" man, huh? That truck driver is merely routine. The boys can pick him up anytime. I've more important things to do. I am convinced that Mona Harrison knows something about the killer. And I will find out what it is. Mona is not involved in this. Besides, the truck driver can clear her. What about Rose's business manager, Kenyon? Hey. This is the Hollywood Emergency Hospital. And you had him brought here. I want to talk to him. - You can't. Why not? He climbed out of a window and got away clean before I managed to question him. When? 9 o'clock last night. That is before Fowler was murdered. Yes. He's one of the more important things I'm interested in right now. Here, come on. - Where you going? I'll get cleaned up, go to my office and write my version of this merry mix-up. And then I'm going to take a nice, long nap. Good. And lay off the clues, huh? I'd hate to think of you taking a nice long nap in the morgue. You want me, Joe? - Yeah. I want you to get all the dope you got on a guy named Rudy Frasso. And step on it. - Rudy Frasso. Okay. Don't do that. I got a king-sized headache. Pretty pictures, Joe. But I'm surprised you got boxed up by a female reporter. A lot of sympathy I get. Is it my fault if an unknown, unsavoury character taps me with a blackjack? You say in the story the police want the business manager Kenyon for the murders. That's what Wilson says. You don't think he's the killer? No. I think the killer is the guy that beat Kenyon within an inch of his life. The same gent who tapped me on the head .. To get the address book I lifted from Lance Fowler's desk. You get a chance to look through it? Part of it and one name stuck out. Here is the file on Rudy Frasso. - Oh, thanks. You didn't mention Frasso. - I didn't want to. Yet. Skim through these, will you. I'm a little fuzzy. Just give me a fast run-down, huh. This mug has quite a history. 1928. Hollywood's youngest bootlegger. And silent partner in Sunset Strip gambling house. 1931. Released. Lack of evidence. '39. In a brawl at an ice-skating rink. It claims he slugged a guy who was with a movie star whom he refused to name. Because he didn't want her to have any unfavorable publicity. Say, that could have been Mona Harrison. Yeah, maybe. What else? Nothing much. He was mixed up in an insurance Bunco plan with one of the big jewelry stores. That didn't stick either. Lack of evidence. Jewelry, eh? Yeah. Sounds like a very cute citizen. Jewelry. Hector and Frasso. Shipments. Someone was looking for something in those bolts of fabrics. Oh, brother. Where are you going? - Fishing. I'm terribly upset, Miss Durant. I hope this interview won't take long. That all depends on you. Now, we will begin before the beginning. And don't hold out on me. Hold out what? - Look, Miss Harrison. I'm a woman. I know the signs. You are protecting someone. Who is it? I am sure I don't know what you mean. Mona. I came to talk about your love life. If you are referring to Joe Medford. There is absolutely nothing between us. That I know. Joe never has anything more personal than a deadline. I'll go out and come in again. I came to talk about your love life. I refuse to discuss my past with you, Miss Durant. It has nothing to do with these murders. I'm not so sure about that. I still say you are covering up for somebody. Why don't you tell me who it is? I'll tell you nothing except to leave. Now, get out. I'm not getting out of here until we have a little chat about Denver. Denver? Yes. Your own home town. Shall I print what I know? Or do you want to come over and sit down and we'll have a little talk? You don't have to print that story about my marriage, do you? No-one in Hollywood knows about it as my name wasn't Mona Harrison then. Why did you run out on him? - I was afraid of him. He was no good. He even married me under a phony name. He hated me. He still hates me. You don't think this is anything to do with the murders? It could have plenty. What makes you say that? Only someone who hated you would have sent that body to you. And only the murderer could have sent it. Who are you talking about? Mona's ex-husband. I tell you he had nothing to do with it. We'll take that up later. Right now, I want to ask you about this invoice. Invoice? Yes. I just found it wadded up in the packing case. You lied to me, Miss Harrison. There were eight bolts of cloth in that box with Hector Rose's body. There are only seven in the police property room. I want the missing bolt. I don't know what you are talking about. Don't stall, Miss Harrison. I don't want to tear the whole house apart. Alright, I did hold it out. It was the material for my Academy Award dinner gown. I didn't think it was important to you. No. You didn't, did you. Where is it? I will show you. Are you playing games, Miss Harrison? It isn't here. - But it must be. I wonder how it got there. - So do I. What did you expect to find, Lieutenant? Never mind. It isn't there. - You may as well tell me. Someone, the killer. Was looking for something in the bolts of cloth at the studio. What was it? - That's my business. Don't get tough with me, Lieutenant. I may decide not to help you. You help me? - Uhuh. Mona's ex-husband could have taken what you are looking for. What do you say, Miss Harrison? - I have nothing to say about him. Withholding evidence is a felony. Maybe if I took you in you'd talk. Nothing you do can make me say a word to involve my ex-husband in these murders. You must still love the guy. - I told you I won't talk about him. How about you? - I took nothing, sir. I've been in Miss Harrison's employ for more .. Okay. So you're an honest butler. But did you see anybody besides Miss Harrison go in this room today? Why, I .. Look at me. I am asking the questions. I know nothing about it, sir. You sure you didn't see anybody? Joe Medford, maybe? - Mr Medford? No, sir. I didn't see anyone. [ Telephone ] Hello? "This is Rosemary. How about dinner?" Sure. But I have to run down town first. Meet you here at seven? "Right." I'll leave the key downstairs. In case arrive first. "Right." Bye. "De Mar cleaners." Is that you Claude? - "Yeah." This is Joe Medford. "Hello, Mr Medford. What can I do for you?" A favor. There is a character outside your place named Rudy Frasso. Will you tell him I want to talk to him. "Hold on a minute." "Hello?" Frasso? "Yeah. What do you want?" I just want to ask you one question. You how have thirty-two teeth. Would you like to try for four? Well, you stop shadowing me. Oh, Mr Frasso. Such language. This is a great story, Joe. But how do you know that hot diamonds are at the bottom of the murders? That's easy. I got the diamonds. You what? - That's right. Hidden away in a nice, safe place. Well, why not let the cops hide them? Because I'm waiting for the killer to show his hand. You think your plan is smart? I think so. It is all beginning to add up. You want to hear it? Shoot. Okay. This is the way I see it. Rose and Fowler were involved in this deal. The hot stuff was shipped to Rose. Hidden in bolts of cloth. And Fowler, being a publicity man had plenty of Hollywood contacts. You know. People who would pay cash for bargains. Frasso. He was he peddler. He was the guy that followed Fowler's lead. But somewhere along the line there was a double-cross. Maybe Rose and Fowler wanted to bow out. So. They were murdered. By Frasso? - Could be. But Frasso warned me not to print anything that would hurt Mona Harrison. So why should a guy who wants to protect her ship a corpse up to her house? That's an angle. There's one thing I am counting on. When my story about the hot diamonds hits the streets. The killer will want to know where I got my information. So will Lieutenant Wilson. And he is going to be very unhappy. That is true. City desk. Yeah. Just a minute. It is for you. It is glamour puss. Hello Mona. Joe. I want you to come out to the house right away. Well, I can't right now. What's up? I can't tell you over the phone. But if you are still looking for the murderer. Don't go on with it, Joe. You are in danger. And so am I. Are you alone? "No. Fields is here." Oh. You can't come tonight, Joe? No. I am all tied up but I will see you first thing in the morning. Goodbye. I think she is really jittery. She says something is going to happen to me. Well, don't let us slow you down. I'll see that you get the prettiest funeral a reporter ever had. Joe. Joseph, are you there? I wouldn't do that if I were you. Who are you? What are you doing here? Take it easy, Miss Durant. I'm not asking you questions. Don't ask me questions. Let me go. Don't touch me. Don't touch me! [ Scream! ] Rosemary? I'll take that. You are a thoughtful guy. I was just about to give up looking. Looking for what? Must you point like that? I was just about to shave. Shave without cream. I wouldn't like that. I've got a very sensitive skin. Maybe you'd like a massage with a gun barrel? Hand it over. I'm sick of getting my brains knocked out by guys like you. Who killed Rose and Fowler? Not me. I'm not the killer type. - No? I suppose you are carrying this little cannon around for laughs? You're the diamond peddler in that big combine. Who is the big man? Who gets the pay-off? I don't know. I wouldn't tell you if I did. - Maybe you'd like a massage? Not me, Medford. Knocking me around won't help you. I don't know who the killer is. Alright. I will accept that answer for now. Let's talk about Hector Rose. He received the hot stuff. But he didn't get any cut. Mr Big had something on him from back east years ago. Rose tried to hold out the last shipment. That was bad. - And what about Fowler? When Rose got murdered he threatened to talk. Why were you so interested in protecting Miss Harrison? Maybe I liked the girl. She had nothing to do with the killings. What about Kenyon. Is he dead too? No. He is probably hiding out somewhere. Scared. He got too curious. You ought to be scared too. And maybe you ought to be. There aren't any nightclubs to hang around in San Quentin. Go ahead. Why don't you yell "copper"? What's the matter? You afraid I'll tell them you got the ice? What was that? How would I know? Rosemary. You must have been born in a closet. Untie me. Get me out of here. Where is he? I'll tear him to pieces with my own teeth. Take it easy. He's gone. What's he doing here? What's he looking for? He's a cute citizen named Rudy Frasso and he was looking for .. Will you stop playing with that goo and listen to the hot lead I've got. This is important goo. I know who sent that body to Mona and I know why. You don't say. He wanted to blast her career. - Yeah? Hit the lights. Maybe he still loves her. Maybe he figures if he knocks her off her pedestal she'll come back to him. Who are you talking about? - Mona's ex-husband. Oh. What? You didn't know she had been married, did you Joseph? Sure. I knew it all the time. - I bet you did. I bet you know too that she is shielding him as she is scared to death of him. What is that? - Diamonds. Real diamonds? Sure. So, that is what Wilson was looking for at Mona's home. Yep. But you got there first. - Yep. You are not going to keep them, Joseph? Yep. - You can't. Why not? - It's dangerous. What is dangerous about it? Why hide them in there? Can you think of a better place for hot diamonds? You've got to turn those over to Wilson. I will not. What do you think I'm hiding them for? For laughs? I just won't let you do this. You and who else? Listen you lug, you might get yourself killed. Frasso was after those diamonds. He might come back. Okay. Except we won't be here. Come on. I'm hungry. - You're always hungry. I think you should call the police. Well stop thinking. It might give you arthritis. Where did you get this story, Joe? - Well, I .. A fine partner. I thought you would share your stuff as soon as you got it. I was just about to tell you about it. I don't like hearing your stuff after it's in print. Suppose we go back inside and you can tell us both about it. Sorry. We have a date with a steak. Inside. I have the key, Lieutenant. Who tore the place apart? A thug named Rudy Frasso. I think he is Mona's ex. The murderer. He might have murdered me. - Too bad he didn't. What happened? - Don't know. I found him prowling the place. I jumped him and he got away. Did he get anything? - No. Not a thing. He didn't come here just because you found his name in Fowler's address book. What was he looking for? I don't know what he was looking for. Joseph. I think I need a drink if you don't mind. Wait. You don't want a drink. Not on an empty stomach. I do. A nice, stiff Highball. No you don't. I'll get you some drinks when we go to dinner. Why can't she have a drink here? Get me some ice, Lieutenant. There isn't any ice. I just filled the trays with water. I'm sorry, Miss Durant. For once, Joe told the truth. There must be some ice. He is right. No ice. - But there has got to be ice. It's gone. - What, the ice? There seem to be plenty of ice cubes in the sink. What were you trying to hide in that tray? Who me? Nothing. Nothing at all. If you don't tell him, I will. - Rosemary. Diamonds. A fortune in uncut diamonds. So the butler did like to me. He saw you take them this afternoon. But they must be. They must be there. He put them there a minute ago. They're gone alright and there is only one guy can have them. Wait. I'm going with you. You're not going anywhere. Try, and I'll have you picked up. Now listen, Wilson. Don't tell me .. - You listen for once. You're in too deep this time, smart guy. Move out of here before I tell you .. And I guarantee you'll wind up in the Hollywood station on a felony charge. I did it for your own good, Joseph. Sure. Why don't you call the squad car for my own good? What's the matter? - Mona. She is alone with Fields. Can't lady be alone with her butler? - Not tonight, Rosemary. Come on. [ Buzzer ] [ Buzzer ] [ Buzzer ] Did anyone go in or out, Dave? The butler. He drove off a couple of hours ago. He just got back. I thought so. Wait here. Don't let anyone through this gate until I give you the word. Park the car, will you. - Okay, Mark. Lieutenant Wilson. How did you get in? I didn't want to disturb Miss Harrison so let myself in quietly. Have a nice drive, Fields? I haven't been out, sir. Yes you have, Fields. It wasn't very smart of you to go off like that leaving Miss Harrison alone. Lucky my partner was watching this house so she was protected while you were out. Oh. You had someone watching the house, huh? - Yes. You shouldn't have lied to me today, Fields. You saw Joe Medford take those diamonds today. You can give them to me now. But I .. - Get them. Yes, sir. I hope .. I hope you don't think I am responsible for the murders. Aren't you? No, sir. Oh no, sir. I didn't. It was just when I saw those diamonds, I .. You are going to arrest me now? No. No? - No. Thank you, sir. Thank you. [ Gunshot! ] Why? [ Gunshot! ] [ Gunshot! ] You killed him. Like you killed the others. I knew it must be you. Only you would send that body to me. You didn't talk then and you don't talk now. Understand? Why did you kill Fields? Because only he knew I had a fortune in diamonds. Now, only you know. Why are you telling me? Because you are going to play in my way now. You're in this up to your neck for covering me. I didn't cover for you. I was afraid. You had a right to be. Nobody runs out on me the way you did. I told you I'd get you back. We are clearing out. To Mexico, to South America. I'm not going anywhere with you. - No? You don't think I'm going to leave you here to talk do you? Make up your mind what it's going to be. Me or .. Don't stop us now, Dave. We've got to see Miss Harrison. You can't go in, Joe. - Why not? Lieutenant Wilson says nobody is to go in. He is in there. Wait a minute, I just told you. The Lieutenant doesn't want company. I haven't got time to argue with you. The killer is in there with Mona. Lieutenant Wilson will handle him. I've just been struck by a great idea. - What? This. Get your hands back in those pockets. Switch on the lights, Rosemary. Search him, baby. He should have two guns and a sock full of diamonds. Throw me that .32. Why, this gun has just been fired. He killed Fields with it. I saw him. Oh. So Fields was number three? You are crazy. - Yeah? And I suppose the slugs they dug out of Hector Rose's body .. Won't fit this little cannon? Then he is your ex-husband, huh? Yes. What toes that prove? It proves that even detectives can make mistakes. I first began to suspect there was something phony .. When you wouldn't pick up that truck driver I kept harping about. You didn't want to pick him up. He was one of your stooges. But you got a little too clever when you sent that corpse to Mona. You did that to ruin her. What you didn't know was that Hector hid the diamonds he was holding from you .. In that shipment of fabrics. Anything else? Yes. In my apartment tonight you mentioned Lance Fowler's little address book. You couldn't possibly have known about that. Unless you lifted it when you slugged me. And when you ignored Frasso and went straight to Fields. I knew that Frasso was your boy. He told you he didn't get the diamonds. Well .. how does it add up? You ought to be wearing a badge. You won't be wearing one long, Mark. Get away from that gun. You don't believe any of this stuff, do you? Put that gun away. Not until the Inspector has a chance to hear everybody's story. I'm not waiting for the Inspector, Dave. I'll walk out of here and you're not going to do anything about it. Better not try it, Mark. You wouldn't shoot me, Dave. Remember the night of the Busanti raid? I saved your skin that night. I stopped a bullet for you. You'll stop another one if you reach for that gun. I like the way you do things, Joe. That job as publicity director is still open. Thanks, Mitch. But I will stick to straight reporting. You see. Rosemary and I, we each got a bonus for our stories and .. We are sort-of figuring on building a little house in the San Fernando valley. Right, Baby? - Right. We're going to put our bonuses together. [ Gunshots! ] [ Gunshots! ] Cut! Alright, boys. Quiet please. Such artistry. You are my greatest dramatic discovery. To think l found you hiding your talents in the reception room. But when do I get to sing? Take 54. Print it. -(Ro-s)-
