(dramatic violin music) - Good morning, gentlemen. We address ourselves this morning to a crowded agenda. However... Developing events in Europe and the Persian Gulf take precedence. Mr. Salazar. - Our intelligence has reported, and we've been able to confirm that a faction within the Arab organization of oil producing states has entered into a conspiracy. Three men. Three men led by Saalaf Insidqi of Kuwait, Mahdi Al-Taleb of Saudi Arabia, and Rashid Al-Sharif of Tunisia. I've organized some 40 independent facilities to engage in petrochemical production. In Saudi Arabia, excavation has begun here at Ajam and Al-Jawf. In Iraq at Kirkuk in the early stages of construction. Iran... Oman... Qatar. Abu Dhabi. Egypt. And Syria. - [Grey Haired Man] The implications? - [Salazar] Crippling. There would be created a production consortium competitive to our own. - [Grey Haired Man] To what extent? - [Salazar] Worldwide competition. A vast apparatus against us in the manufacture and marketing of petrochemicals. - Then I would assume that steps are being taken to neutralize this plan. - Yes sir. (speaking in foreign language) - This new Arab consortium is of no consequence to us economically. But, Al-Taleb... Heads in Arab faction oppose to any further increase in oil prices. He is an internationalist who proposes to extend and share Arab wealth with the poor consuming countries of the Third World. - What is your analysis of his ultimate objective? Only as it concerns to the Soviet Union. - To soften, if not eliminate our influence throughout the Third World. - I assume you're considering countermeasures to the situation.

No! (screaming) (catchy trumpet jazz music) (ambulance sirens) (intense ominous instrumental music) (Arabian flute music) (shouting in foreign language) (suspenseful instrumental music) (gunshot) (fireworks exploding) (uptempo festival music) - I didn't realize you were so hungry. - Famished. (calming acoustic guitar music) (calming acoustic guitar music) - Come here. - Sante. - To you. (calming acoustic guitar music) - [Higher Pitched Man] I thank you for coming. - [Deeper Pitched Man] It was your wish, Majesty. - [Higher Pitched Man] Five years, 17 as you. - [Deeper Pitched Man] Nor my beliefs. (loud singing) - Did he offer you the position? - Yes. - Did you accept? - Yes, of course. But, it's strange. - You're frightened. - Yes. But you'll be with me old friend, to pick up the pieces. - [Flight Attendant] Good evening, this flight number 35 arriving from Paris will be deplaning at gate number six. Passengers are cautioned not to leave their-- - It's so good to have you back, Ms. Nicole. - I'll drive. (cheery suspenseful instrumental music) (phone ringing) - There was a call for you earlier. - Any message? - Just a number for you to call. I have it somewhere. Sorry. - A call for you, Ms. Nicole. - [Nicole] Excuse me. - Why does she bother to come home? (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - Welcome to New York, Your Excellency. Captain Frank Dedario. I'm assigned as your Chief of Security. - Colonel Hamid. - Colonel. - I would've taken the scenic route sir, if there was one. When was the last time you were here? - Oh, I've been back and forth many times. I was a student here for four years. (police sirens) - [Waldorf Manager] Welcome to the Waldorf Astoria, Your Excellency. - [Reporter] Your Excellency, Andy Hampsas, NBC News. May we have your comment on the recent assassinations? - [Your Excellency] Well, the Arab world has lost three of its best men. They were my friends and I shall miss them. - [Andy] Do you know who was responsible for their murders? - [Your Excellency] If you'll excuse me. - Thank you sir. The new Saudi Arabian Minister of State, Khalil Abdul-Muhsen. Described most recently in the European press as a tiger with soft brown eyes. He is asked to make a statement before the General Assembly regarding changes in Saudi Arabian foreign policy. In the light of recent terrorist activity in the Arab States, a special session has been scheduled for tomorrow. - Nobody, I mean nobody comes up here without a clearance, hotel personnel included. - Yes sir. - Where's the kitchen? - Splendid. - [Man In Suit] Your Excellency, can I get you anything else? - A helicopter. - Just tell her I'll be home late. I don't know how late. Not 'til late dinner, I've already eaten. Yeah, I've had a pastrami sandwich. 10-4. (dramatic instrumental music) - Hamid. It's good to be back, you know? It's a magic city. (speaking in French) - [Flight Attendant] Ladies and gentlemen. We are beginning our descent towards New York's Kennedy Airport. Please fasten your seat belts and extinguish your cigarettes, thank you. (phone ringing) - Yes sir? Where? The basement? Yes sir. Charlie, the Minister of State wants to go to the basement. - The hell's in the basement at four AM? - Maybe he's interested in plumbing. - No, there's a train station in the basement. - [Charlie] Train station? - Yeah, there's a train station in the basement of this building. That's what he said. - Some of this country's great leaders use this station. Roosevelt, Eisenhower. MacArthur. I was a student here in New York when Eisenhower was nominated to be president. On the battlefield of indecision lie the bleached bones of countless thousands. Who in a moment of decision waited and in waiting, died. That was part of a speech by Senator Everett Dirksen. His Keynote Speech at the Republican Convention. Everybody wanted to know where the quotation came from. Dirksen eventually admitted that he'd got it from an advertisement for soap. It was a bleaching chemical. Bleached bones. Written by some obscure copywriter. It's wonderful. - You'll be just as eloquent tomorrow at the United Nations. - Eloquent. - [Hamid] Yes. - My good friend, I shall be just as eloquent. (crowd chanting) - Khalil. I'm sorry, Khalil. The death of Al-Taleb is a sad blow for all of us, I mourn him as I would my own brother. Your presence here gives me renewed hope. We can be friends, Khalil-- - I always thought that was possible, Fouad. Perhaps with the death of my predecessor, we might accomplish it. - Yes. - He was a man of infinite value. A visionary. - Yes. - Your vision reaches no further than your stomach. - Oh yeah, this new ambassador. Khalil Abdul-Musehn, Musil, I don't know. (speaking in Japanese) (clapping) - [General Assembly Speaker] I now invite His Excellency, Khalil Abdul-Muhsen to address the General Assembly. - Mr. President. Recently the world was shocked by the murders of three men. Three men who'd come together with the same vision of how to combat the immutable forces which seem bent on dragging the world into Holocaust. One of these men was my predecessor... And good friend. The Minister of State from Saudi Arabia, Mahdi Al-Taleb. I would like to speak for him, and in his memory. If those who caused his death did so in the belief that they were destroying the ideals and principles for which he stood, they were wrong. His assassination has failed. Mahdi Al-Taleb worked toward an Arab world united. Where none should thirst, where none should go naked, where none should starve. He worked toward a world where each of our brothers might rise up each day, though his home be the desert. And clothe himself in dignity. This he worked for, and fought for. He believed that the cohering principle of human existence was peace. And so he was murdered. His murderers as we all know, sit among us here. I address you now. You've failed. You have destroyed flesh, only that. That is your triumph and your dilemma. For how do you kill a dream? The dreamer, yes. The dream, never. The dream survives. My intention is to give it substance. I now address all of you, I offer you a reality. The organization of petroleum exporting countries, OPEC, was established when we had no other way to convince the world to take us seriously. And to combat the oil cartel which has raped the Middle East for half a century. We were forced to speak with a corporate voice and present a unified front. This voice is now confused. It speaks in dark places, arranges arms deals, political, economic blackmails, terrorist raids. Chooses sides, draws lines, and we lurch towards Holocaust. My country cries enough. My country calls for a new global, social, political contract. And if that means abandoning OPEC, we are prepared to do so. We will enter into partnership with any country for the research and development of new sources of energy. I call for a direct dialogue with Israel so we can create a Palestinian state with men of good will at a conference table and not from the debris of exploded villages and human life. Saudi Arabia will no longer contribute to the hostility between Arab and Israeli. - Somebody better throw a net over him. - I'll give him a month. A week. - On November 14th, 1974, here before the United Nations General Assembly, a man came out of the holy land and he said "I come bearing an olive branch, and a Freedom Fighter's gun." Do not let the olive branch fall from my hand. I hold neither a symbol nor a gun. My hands are empty. They reach out to you. Which of you will take them? (clapping) - A week. Not my quote. (clapping) - One question sir. Did the state department have previous knowledge as of the content of your speech? - No. - Your Excellence, in the wake of three assassinations, do you fear for your safety? - I fear for the safety of all of us. - [Old Reporter] Your Excellence, please-- - [Frank] Please, no more questions. (reporters talking over each other) (police sirens) - That's right, that's right, get out of here! - There's a place in The Village called Caruso's. - Caruso's? - Mott and Grand. - Left on second to Houston. Now there's one, that's a good one. It's in the color. That's black, the black ones aren't as bitter. No black, and light. - Less seeds. - That's right, you know. See, that's a male and that's a female. - Oh, we better have them both. - Why not? No, no, no, it's gotta be something else. It's in the leavening. - Stone oven. - The Iraqi delegate is here to see you. He is furious. That's good. - I forgot the olive oil. - Very good. - You could've at least warned us, Khalil. You seem to have developed a flair for the dramatic. What's to become of us if Saudi Arabia withdraws? It would mean the end of OPEC. - Perhaps the birth of something better? - What are you up to, Khalil? - Well, you're coming to the reception tonight? - [Iraqi Delegate] Yes. - We may speak then. - [Iraqi Delegate] But Khalil... - I've forgotten the olive oil. (classical violin music) - Ah, Khalil. - Ah, later. - Congratulations. That was quite a speech. - Thank you very much. - Well at the least, at the very least, it is not OPEC which allows us to say that we can do this to you it is the Arab oil boycott. Isn't that right, Khalil? - Of course. - [Black Haired Man] Certainly you weren't serious. - About what? - Your speech was Marxist. - Then you weren't listening. Pardon me. - Your Excellency. I heard your speech, you're marvelous. - And you were there? - Of course. - Ms-- - Khalil, excuse me please. - Excuse me. Perhaps we can discuss this later. What is it? - The Palestinians will never sit down and talk with the Israelis, sure you must know that. - I know it, but I don't understand it. I don't understand it, Fouad. Because talk from the barrel of a gun is a sad and mindless life to choose. - Not mindless, Khalil. The Israelis used it and became a state, and unless you understand that, your politics have no point. - There is only one point. These murders must stop. What is this death wish you have? - What are you saying, Khalil? You turn your back on the Palestinians, you'll withhold your dollars? They pour in, dollars and guns from more places than you know. We will miss Saudi Arabia's support but we will get along without it. - Oh, I'm sure you will. But whenever the communists want the triggers pulled, they'll make sure you have the guns. - I'm a Fascist too. Does that surprise you? - No, but wait 'til they hand you the bill. (laughing) Family. - Nicole Scott. Her father is the ex-Ambassador to the court of St. James's. - Who's he? The British attache. (laughing) - Uh, phone calls for interviews. Meet The Press and... And persistently, something called The Today Show. - The Today Show? Well what's that? - I haven't the foggiest notion. - [Driver] What do you think of this Arab, Frank? - Don't like him. - I haven't seen these men before. - Fellow Arabians, they arrived last night. - Why? - Added security. - But why? - Let me just put it this way, sir. Before your speech at the U.N. you were graded a C minus risk. You've been elevated to an A. That's the reading we get from our intelligence. - Specifically, from where? Moscow, for instance? Iraq? - All right, yes. We know the Russians have intensified their intelligence operations in New York. They're very busy people. They've been drinking a lot of coffee with the Iraqis. - Since my speech. Tell me something, Mr. Justin. What do you hear from Washington? What does your intelligence in London have to say? - What do you mean? - Oh, why do you infer that the hostility toward me only comes from the East? I thought I was becoming persona non grata everywhere. - Well, let me just put it this way sir. You're getting to be a very important man. - This is delicious. Very good. - [Female Reporter] what about women? - Marvelous. - I mean, what about Arab women? - Marvelous. - But, isn't it true that your women are considered chattel? - Well, in some respects my country is just coming out of The Middle Ages. So we have very little demand for pantyhose. And that is our women's greatest advantage. They will lead us to wherever it is they want to take us. Give them time. - In your recent speech before the United Nations you referred to a new, global, socio, political contract, could you be a bit more specific about that? - Oh I would prefer to wait two weeks until my next address at the United Nations. - Okay. - [Khalil] Where I will outline the specifics of my plan. - Is it true Your Excellency that the word children or child does not exist in the Arabic language? - Pretty girl. - [White Shirt Man] Mhm. The British attache. - [Justin] This guy here. - [White Shirt Man] I don't know. Frank? - [Frank] I don't know. - [Justin] Colonel? - And the bid is $3,000 to start, at $3,000, now 500 on the right now. $3,500, $4,000 on the left now. Four.

(yelling) (laughing) - Hey! Ooh! - Everything all right? - No. Why'd you stop? (laughing) Ah! Ah! - Where'd you get that scar? - Silly fight. I lost it. - To a woman? - Sabra. In the Six-Day War, she gave it to me on the fifth. (chuckling) - How? - I looked up, she was standing over me with a bayonet. - Uh huh. - I said don't. She did. - What did you do to her? - I made her part of my harem. (laughing) - You are insane. - Khalil! - What about Saudi women? Are they beautiful? - Extraordinary. - [Hamid] Khalil! - We must go. (soft acoustic guitar music) - Thought we came here to buy a hat? - And also to shake up the world a little bit. - Did you? - Yes. - What soft brown eyes. (shouting) - Look, let me find you a good one, a nice big one just for you. Here, here, here's one. (suspenseful instrumental music) (birds chirping) (helicopter flying overhead) - Get dressed. (ominous ambient music) (gunshots) (suspenseful instrumental music) (gunshots) (gunshots) Give me the gun. (ominous ambient music) (speaking in foreign languages) - [Reporter] A suicide mission. The dead men are believed to be Palestinian terrorists. However, according to the latest information, a denial has come from-- - And Arafat? - [Hamid] Arafat denies it was the work of the Palestinian Liberation Organization. - No mention of Ms. Scott? - Only that there was a woman with you. A mystery woman. - About 80 minutes out. Contact New York Center and have them reroute it to Teterboro, I got a couple of choppers standing by there. After the speech we're gonna move him to the Saudi Embassy. - Does he know that? - It was at his request. - Having saved my life, you now become responsible for it. You know, it's written that way. - Where? - It's part of our culture. - Where? - Saudi Arabia. - It's not Arabian, it's Sioux Indian. - Indians, Arabians, all men are brothers. (laughing) Look after her. - How do you feel sir, how do you feel? - Better, thank you. - How about when they were shooting at you sir? - Frightened. - Will yesterday's incident affect what you're going to say? - Absolutely not. (clapping) (clapping) - I now invite His Excellency, Khalil Abdul-Muhsen to address the General Assembly. - Mr. President. I've been authorized by my government to present a fundamental change of policy with respect to the organization of petroleum exporting countries. My government believes that Israel could make a valuable contribution to OPEC. Therefore, we propose a partnership with the State of Israel. (clapping) Our partnership born out of need, each to the other. The Arab nations have the raw materials, Israel has the most advanced technology in our part of the world. We look to the future. Saudi Arabia has already agreed to a mutual assistance pact with the State of Israel. I have been assured by the Israeli government that they will accept admission into OPEC as a non-producing member and is an equal partner if it is offered. This offer... This offer will be the subject of the OPEC meeting next month. Saudi Arabia is determined to back Israeli acceptance with all the power at its command. (clapping) As a first step... As a first step... As a first step towards the Middle East free. Free of the destructive political and economic influences which have been exerted upon us by the great powers of the East and the West. Influences which have strangled us for centuries. We stand at the crossroads of human history. To those who would work with us towards peace, we embrace you. To those who would keep Arabs and Israelis enemies, we defy you. To those who would keep us apart, we shall overcome you. I thank you. (clapping) - Well done sir. - Most impressive. - [Police Officer] Move it, keep moving. Move it, come on now, get moving. Behind the barricades, get behind the barricades. - [Grey Suit Man] Black, no sugar. - Thanks pal. - Permits four, message 132, this date 09, 42 hours. What the hell is message 132? - 132... From Peterson, Los Angeles. Ralph Zulna AKA Piotr Malet. Real name Gregor Zulniko. Left the city last night, TWA Flight 13 to Kennedy refer zero one six... Zero one six... Beirut. From Embassy Beirut. Advise Ralph Zulna aka Piotr Malet. - Okay come on, screw the AKA's, I know who Ralph Zulna is. - Surveillance terminated in Beirut. Zulna left Beirut, Lufthansa Flight 47. - Damn, really. - [Frank] Who's Ralph Zulna? - Who the hell knows. I think he's in the crowd. He was around when they gathered up the bodies that load the airplane. We got nine crowd shots, I've been watching the Israeli compound in Munich. He shows up for, during the rant. That's who is he. - And now he's here. - [Justin] And now he's here. - Why? (police sirens) - Thanks. (crowd singing and chanting) - You stole that. - It's for my collection. - [Nicole] You steal towels. - No, I collect them. - [Nicole] That's a Waldorf towel. - Wait 'til you see the ones we have in Basra, they'll go around us twice. (laughing) Are you coming with me? Come with me, Nicole. Saudi Arabia. How can you not want to spend a week in Saudi Arabia? What would you do here? - Not clutter up your life. - But you've already cluttered up my life. I want you to clutter up my life. Listen to me. I have to meet with my government, some policy matters. And then we'll have the time. I want to show you my country. Come with me, Nicole. - Why is that important to you? - Nicole, do me a favor. When I'm talking to you, listen to me. Will you try to do that? - I always listen. - I told you about the towel. The wonderful Basra towel. We could live in it for three days. (laughing) That's fantastic. - What's fantastic? - You laughed, you want to do it. - [Nicole] I laughed because you're mad. - What will you think when I tell you I love you? I'm mad? - I don't know. - I do, you know. I love you. - [Nicole] God. - What? - I love you. (crowd shouting) - [Beige Jacket Protester] Hey, we have a right to be here, buddy. - How'd they know? How'd they find out we were here? - 20 minutes. - This city has a perfect record. Let's keep it that way. Let's get him out of here alive. - Hey now, look. We've got as much security on him as we had on Arafat. You want to know something? More. What about your people? I don't know what that means, I don't know what shaking your head means. - It means Captain, from our end, we got the best security car from Washington that's available. And everybody that's available, okay? What's this? - Mexico City is inquiring to the whereabouts of Yasmin Tafnir. Unknown. He checked out of the Princess Isabella hotel last night. - And they lost him. - They lost him. - Beautiful. What about Kennedy and LaGuardia? - Negative. - Subject could've flown in from Tahoe, Taxco, or Cuernavaca to New Orleans say or... Or catch a flight to Baltimore. Maybe come here by train or get a car and drive here. - Yeah, subject could've done that, huh. - Yes sir. - Let's get out of here, Captain. - I'm ready, I told you I'm ready. - Just tell His Excellency he goes out the side. Right? - [Hamid] Right. - I got a flying squad decoy out the front way, I got the motorcade covered from here to the airport, the works. Well, you heard the Captain. Just tell him. No problems if he does what we tell him to do. What do you think? - I think it's gonna be okay. I don't see any problem. - You want to know something? The kinda crazies we got floating around out there, that can be a problem. (crowd chanting) (crowd chanting) - Get out of my way you son of a bitch! Move it, run back! Move it back! Get the hot dog stand out of there. Come on, get it out, move it! (loud explosion) - [Security Officer] Take the wheel Hamid, get him out of here. Bangkok! Move out, move! (screaming) (loud explosion) (loud explosions) - [Black Shirt Guy] Pick her up, pick her up, pick her up! (screaming) (ambulance sirens) - [Justin] Come on Frank, come on! Come on, Frank. (ambulance sirens) (loud crying) - [News Reporter] It's not possible to telL at this time the full extent of the casualties. There were at least four bombs that exploded in several second intervals outside of the Saudi Arabian consulate at 78th Street and Fifth Avenue.
