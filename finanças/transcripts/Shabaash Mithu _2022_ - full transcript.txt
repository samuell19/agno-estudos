Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. We saw a ray of hope when we were told that CAI is supporting us. We play for India as well, sir. We have an identity as well. Do you like cricket? Cricket is my life, sir. Name any five… Women cricketers. Any three? Sorry, sir. Give me one name, man. Sorry, sir! There's your identity. Sir, we have an identity as well. We play for India as well, sir. Girls can't do it, idiot. And you can't bat to save your life, dummy. Really? Show me! I'll show you. Howazzat! Yes! What were you saying? What couldn't I do? Look, I got blew you away! You're calling me an idiot? You're the idiot! Your father's an idiot. Your whole family, your friends, your school… They're all idiots! You idiot! Idiot! Idiot! Idiot. Come on! -I must be on a diet of chilies -Leave me alone. When I was pregnant with you! - I wanna play. - You're acting like a hoodlum. You keep behaving like a boy! Your father will skin me alive if he finds out. This is what you're gonna wear now! You won't dress like boys anymore. Get in. Come on. Let's go. Hello, madam. My name's Shagufta. Yes? Please make her a girl. But she is a girl, Shagufta. Sorry, madam. She may look like one, but she behaves like a boy. She's got a foul mouth just like them. "I'll clean your clock! See ya later! If I lose it, you'll bruise it." That's how she speaks! Madam, maybe if she comes here, learns a few steps, she'll act more like a female. What's your name? Noorie. Nice. Do you know what it means? No one's ever told me. Noorie means "sparkle"! Your eyes sparkle just like your name! Would you like to learn Bharata Natya? - Yes, I can take a chance. - Noorie… Mithali. Watch your mouth! Noorie, she's Mithali. My best student. Mithali, she's Noorie. She's your new best friend. What?! Becoming best friends isn't that easy! I'll find out after we play together… If she's worth the effort. Of course. You can play all you like after class. Okay? Okay, fine. Show me your nails. Why nails? She might scratch me if she doesn't like me. - Kitten! - Hey! Where the hands are, go the eyes Where the eyes are, goes the mind Where the mind goes, there is expression Where there is expression, Feeling is evoked Where the hands are, go the eyes Where the eyes are, goes the mind Where the mind goes, there is expression Where there is expression, Feeling is evoked I guess the teacher's lost her marbles. It's been a while now, Noorie. If you don't learn quickly, the teacher's gonna be furious! I've no interest in learning any of this. It's very easy. I'll teach you. Watch me. - Leave me alone! - Come on! - I don't want to do it. - Come on. It's easy! - Leave me alone. - Come on! Come on. Place your hands here. Up. Very good. Now bend your knees. Yeah, right. Now… Tai-yum. Tai-yum. Ta-tha. Ta-tha. Tai-yum. Tai-yum. Okay? - Ta-ha… - Ta-ha. Now watch me as I do it faster, alright? Back in position. Tai-yum... God, I completely forgot about it. I had to give this bottle of Horlicks to my brother, Mithun. - Do you wanna come along? - Come. Now, this is the place where I want to be! Let's go inside. I want to play cricket like Mithun when I grow up. - Do you like cricket as well? - Yes. Sachin is my favorite. Wait. Wait. What are you doing here? Go back! Go! - Catch it! - Come on! A girl caught the ball! That's his sister. Hey! Why did you catch it? I told you to stay out! I'll thrash you if I see you on the ground again! Not if I thrash you first, fatso. No, no, please… - Noorie, stop! - Look, a girl's beating him up! - Leave me alone, Noorie! - Noorie! Noorie! Noorie! She's beating him up! He's getting thrashed by a girl! Noorie! Mithali's friend hit me in front of my friends. Really? Now they won't let me join the training! I'll never get selected by Sam path sir. - That's not true, Mithun… - Why did you send them to the ground? It's your fault, Mom. Sam path sir… Yes, Sam path sir. He's trained every under-13 and under-16 player from our district. And a few players have played for the national team as well. Oh, yeah, yeah! The guy who played just one test match in his life. But got nowhere. But a nice player. He was decent. Your game will improve if he trains you. Mithun, eat. Mom. Mom, I need to stay fit for a week. I need to focus on my practice. So, no more chores. No one's going to bother you, sweetheart. You eat it. I don't wanna eat food from his plate. All the best for tomorrow. Play like Sachin. Fine. But you should stay away from her. She's always hanging around our place. Hey, fatso! Stay away from the fritters, or you'll be farting on the ground. Grandma, Noorie's yelling at me again. Look here, girl. If you touch my child again, I'll break your arm with a katta. Who do you think you are? I will cut off your hands and legs and feed them to the bats. Yes. Be careful! This is our secret ground. Your fat brother won't bother us here. You bat and I'll bowl. But I've never played cricket before. Oh, God! I'll be your coach. You need to remember three things to play cricket. Low ball, S ball, Howazzat. Are you getting me? Yeah… But you find it tough, Noorie and her sparkle are here to help you, alright? What happened? We need fielders. Rekha, Sujata, Kavita, Supriya, Veena, Meenakshi, Devki, Karuna. Our dance group. And that one's your old grandma. The rule is you've to hit the ball between them, without touching them. If the ball touches anyone, you're out. But if you hit Grandma, it's a six. Okay? But Grandma is an elderly woman, Noorie. I want revenge. She fried my brains. Now let's play. You can't even hit a ball. Okay, fine. Close your eyes. Forget the fact that you're playing cricket. Imagine… You're practicing Bharata Natya. Do you remember what the dance teacher had taught us? "Where the hands are, go the eyes." Where the hands are, go the eyes Where the eyes are, goes the mind Where the mind goes, there is expression Where there is expression, feeling is evoked Sorry, Sujata. What's wrong? The world spun as I tripped Can't stop limping since then As the bails flew in the air behind me I lost my mind Hip, hip, hooray! Hip, hip, hooray! Hip, hip, hooray! Hip, hip, hooray! Bounces on the ground - Out! - Like a stubborn top Mom and Dad… Get furious at home Stays firm on the ground I lost for no reason Why does it stare at me? Thinks I'm a fool My original's become a fake You're Sachin, I'm Kambli. Cricket is all about friendship. Imagine the 11 of us together. And you need to cut your hair! It messes with your concentration during practice. Hip, hip, hooray! Hip, hip, hooray! Hip, hip, hooray! I told you not to hit it too hard, right? That was the only ball I had. How are we going to play now? It's not my fault. Whose fault is it? We've lost the ball! How are we going to play? Who's going to find it? You… Get lost. What are you guys doing here? This is our ground. Leave! You little dolt. Are you blind?! Can't you see that we're playing cricket here? - Cricket? - Cricket? They're playing cricket?! Cricket? With a bloody katta? Look! Look, guys. - Look. Wow! - Keep it back. Keep it back. - I won't… - We won't! - What will you do? - You want the ground, right? Yeah. You know what? Try and get our Sachin out. - Sachin? Sachin! - Sachin! - Try and get her out, man! - That little rabbit?! Get her out. The kid looks scared! Raju can get her out! Come on, Raju. Go on! Little rabbit! Hey, little rabbit! - It's alright. - Try again. It's alright. Come on, Raju. It's okay, Raju. Come on. We'll get her out! Try again! Come on, Raju! Go on! Whoa! She hit that one as well… What the hell… - You can do it, Raju! - Get her, man! Come on! - Yes, Raju! - Come on, Raju. - It's okay. Come on, Raju. - Next one. Next one. - He's gonna get her this time. - Try the right side. She's playing well. - She hit a six. - Again?! Raju, what are you doing?! Sir! Raju, take five. Surya, you're up. Come on. - Sure, bro. - Yes, you go. He'll do it. Come on, Surya! - Oh, God! - Come on! Surya… What are you doing, Surya? Stop. What's he doing? Who taught you? Noorie. She's Kambli, I'm Sachin. What do you like the most about cricket? Friendship. What's the first rule of batting? First rule… Never get out. And second? Always hit the ball between Rekha and Supriya. So that they don't get hurt. That's how I always play. But you hit a six by hitting the ball in the air today. I broke a rule. Made a mistake. How will you rectify your mistake? Practice? Natural talent. With proper training… Could be a professional cricketer. I had told you, right? Whatever you say, sir. Determination. That's what matters. The rest is… luck. Yes. He's very talented. Cricket is his destiny. He's very agile. Go touch his feet. - Sir's feet. - Wait a second. Grandma, I was talking about Mithali. Her footwork's really natural. With proper training, she can play for India. Mithali's been playing cricket? For four months and three days. It's this tomboy's fault! She's taught her everything. She's always following her around everywhere. Always wandering around… - Playing cricket. - So what? Why? Why can't she play? She should go to school and study, right? So that she can grow up, get married, have kids… Mithu did not tell us anything! What do you want her to do? Play cricket! What? Play cricket? What about our tradition? What... What has she done? What is this? I don't understand anything, Mom. Why would she do that? Thousands of people chop their hair off at Tirupati. She's done the same. What does it matter? What can I say… 7:00 a.m. Keyes Ground. Bring Kambli along. Here we are. Come on! Enjoy. Let's go inside. You should work on your batting, bro. Did you watch him bowl? It doesn't matter! You can see the ball, right? Now, this is your home. This is all that matters. If you don't like it, the door's that way. You may leave right now. But if you don't, there's no turning back. - Okay? - Yes, sir! One round. Come on. What are you doing? My dance teacher has taught me that the earth is our mother. We ask for her forgiveness when we set foot on her. Wear your shoes. Start running. One… Two… Three… Four… Change. Wait. Keep the bat close to the body, okay? Follow the ball. And keep the bat straight. Come on, Noorie. Good. Good. Soft. What are you doing? What is this? What is this? What excuse did you make today? I said Dorai Uncle's a pretty good math tutor. - What? - Don't worry. Bend these two fingers. Keep the ball here. Grip it. Anti-clock… And then use your third finger to… Turn the ball, okay? This is your leg-stump. Okay? And… This is your… Middle-stump. Okay? Mark it. Mark. Next, we'll practice the straight drive, okay? Tapping. One! Two! Three! Good. Now cover drive. Tapping. One! Two! Three! Very good. What excuse did you make today? Dorai Uncle's science class. Oh, God! Come on, Noorie! You need to inform your father! Come on. Throw the ball. Stay in line. Don't drag your back foot. Come on, bowl! Don't drag your back foot, okay?! Stay! Stay there, okay?! Don't drag it, okay? Back foot! Don't dra... Come here! Okay? Come on, bowl! Come on! The foot stays here, okay? Come on, bowl. Mithali! You don't get it, right? I've fixed your shoe. Play. Come on, bowl. Noorie! Sam path sir turned out to be a villain. Take it off. Which doctor asked you to do it? Well… Sorry, child. What... Do you have ice? - Yeah. - Get it. - Sir, she needs some rest... - Tomorrow. 7:00 a.m. Sir, how's the coaching going? It's good. Why wasn't your leg in line during the match against Australia? Come on, sir. Stop scolding me. I'm the captain of the women's team. Kids never grow up… For their teacher. Autograph, please. Later. Let me bat peacefully. Get it! Poor shot selection. Wrong shot for the wrong ball. Come on, sir. I know which shot to play on which ball. Which shot should you've played on this ball? Cover drive. Bravo, Mithu. Mithu, pad up. Bowl the same ball. Just as you did last time. Nice shot. Hurry up. I'm running late. Stop. Stop. Here you go. Move over, noob. I am already late. Come on, give me the ball. Noorie took her own sweet time to "sparkle" today. Father was traveling to Ahmed a bad. The train was late and so was I. Liar. Save this excuse for someone else. Fine, no more excuses. Ball! Sagar was asking about you yesterday. What did he ask? Your birthday, your sun sign, your favorite color. God! Did you tell him? Will he be standing outside my door with a gift in his hand? No… He must be playing FLAMES right now. And what was the outcome? Let me show you. Catch it. Catch it! Got you! Mithu! Noorie! Sir wants to see you. Helmet. Helmet. Come on, hurry up. We're in trouble because you were late. I don't think this is what it's about. I didn't get tea either! Are you done with your practice? - Yes, sir. - No, sir. And why do you keep hitting the ball in the air? The selection is in two days! Do you want to play for India or not? Yes, sir. How long have you been lying to your father to play cricket? Seven years, sir. Do you know what your problem is? Everything was handed out to you on a platter. Like a pet dog. Life won't give you a second chance. Don't forget it. HAVE: MOM, DADDY… MY BROTHER, MITHUN, Sam path sir was right. Life won't give you a second chance. Once I get selected, Mithu, I'll definitely talk to Dad. Of course, she's late today as well! Noorie, let's go! Noorie! I knew… My Sachin would always come for her Kambli, come what may. But your Kambli won't be playing anymore. Promise me… You won't get angry and you won't cry. I'm getting married today. It was fixed last week. But I'm only 15, that's the reason Father didn't make it a big deal. Hey said, "He's a good man. Why wait till you turn 18?" His name is Azaan. He lives in Dubai. But you focus on your game, Mithu! Imagine me standing right next to you when you play. I know you must be crying your heart out even though you promised! Forgive me, Mithu. Yours… Truly, Noorie. Look at this ground. It's just like life. Every pain seems inferior once you're out there. The game is all that matters. Play. Good shot. - Nice shot! - Run! Run! Great. Nice shot! Nice one! I do. I do. Come on! Get it! I do! Bravo! Nice one, man. Nice one. Hello. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Sir! Thank you, sir. Thank you. Mithu got selected for the national camp. - Congratulations. - Superb, Mithu. Congrats. I… I'll will be visiting your sister for a couple of days. I haven't seen her for a while. I'll take you there, Grandma. And the association… Where's she gonna live? Don't worry about that. We'll take care of everything. If the child is talented, if she is dedicated, then everything will work accordingly… No, is this place secure… Do you know what kolmi is? - Kolmi? - What? God, you really don't know what kolmi is? What's going on? These noodles are so bland! Can you spice it up, please? Yeah! Please add some color to it, come on. Add some spice! No, add some green chilies. Where? Up your ass? Oh, God! She's terrible! Listen… Kolmi. What the hell is kolmi? Oh, God! Prawns, you fool. It's straight when it's alive, and curls up after it's dead. First, you dry it out. Then, you store in a container, add some spices, close the jar, and you put it out in the sun to dry. It's a terrific recipe for a loncha. Loncha?! Relish, you dimwit. Pickle. Why couldn't you just say that? Your mother uses this method to make pickles. And my father uses the same method to make leather. Wow! Kanpur Leather. Have you heard about it? Kanpur? Who's... Look. Who is she? She looks like a model. Who is this Barbie doll? She's the one who has replaced Mamta Patil. Excuse me? May I have a cup of tea, please? Hey, English-medium! You come in, make tea, and get lost. Tell me more about leather. Yes… So… First, he skins the dead cattle. - God! - What the hell! The skin is washed with salty water, to get rid of the hair and the meat. You've done it? Yes. We have a tank as broad as this table, and as long as the table where Ms. Delicate is sitting. - Really? - Yeah. The skin that survives the salt, can be turned into strong leather. And the one that doesn't… Nice shot. Look at how she's bowling. - Where's her bat going?! - Your leg should go towards the ball! Do it properly. Hold the seam properly. Has anyone seen my yellow pouch? - Yellow pouch? - No… Excuse me. The yellow pouch had my pills. Has anyone seen it? What's wrong? Not feeling well? Periods… it's pretty painful. I needed a painkiller. Oh, Ms. Delicate! Please, have you seen my yellow pouch... Hey! Are you that fragile? She is fragile. If someone's taken her magic pills, please give them back. Please! I'll blackout during practice. Hey! There are 30 girls out here. And you're the only one who's gonna blackout? Drama queen. You've replaced Mamta, right? Let's see you play. Richard and Gavaskar never wore a helmet. Leave the helmet, show us your reflexes. Keep your eyes on the ball! Good one. Good one. Good job. Bravo! How about a trip to the hospital? Sure. She deserves a fresher's welcome. Of course, she does. Come on, Sresha. - Good one. - Great bowling, Sresha! What's wrong? Can't see the ball? Was it too fast for you? Come on! - Very good. Good one. - Missed it! - Great bowling. - Keep going! Come on! Bravo, Khushi. - Brilliant! - Well done, Khushi! Come on! - Bravo, Sresha! - Well bowled. Come on, water break. - I need water! - Roma. Nilu… Stop. Go back! Come on, girls! Keep going! Come on, Nilu. Come on, girl! Back to field! Come on, Nilu. Oh, no! Stop dancing. Pick up the bat and start hitting. - Come on! - Forget about playing like Mamta, learn to stay on the pitch. Nice, man! Good ball, Kajal! What's wrong? Oh, that hurt! Be careful! Great job, Sresha. Can't you see the ball? Bloody loser. Where did they find her? Yes! Keep going! Do you love the smell of leather in the morning? Welcome to WCB! - Harder! Harder! - Yes! - Yes! Yes! - Harder! Harder! Come on, Sukumari Di! Let's play a game with the boys. Harder. Come on! Jhorna, keep it down. She's getting aroused. What?! No, I'm not! When was the last time you saw a guy? My father was the last guy I had seen. Fine, I'll settle for him! Oh, look! She's here with the letter. - Harder! Harder! - Yes! Come on! Prema's in deep shit. - What? - Is Prema dead? No, dude! She was on a holiday with her fiancé. Yeah? But they couldn't wait to consummate their wedding! - This girl is special! - She indeed is! The chief wants to see you. Pack your bags. You've got a good-looking face. Get married, have some kids. Don't waste your time here. I had told you, right? This is not how it works. That's right. But you don't listen. Okay. - Excuse me. - Yes? - Shanta ma'am? - She is inside. - Thank you. - Okay. Ma'am, you wanted to see me? What's the most important thing when you're batting? Footwork? The most important thing is the position of your head. If your head's in the right place, no one can get you out on the field, or in life. The warm-up match is in two days. Pull yourself together, or you won't last. The players you'll be playing with, they are totally different. Different age, more experienced. And their journey is… Completely different. There's a girl called Jhorna. Do you know about her life? She wakes up every morning, slogs over a hot stove, takes a train, practices for five hours every day in the hot sun, and works at a tea stall in the evening. That is her life. Khushi. Daughter of a blacksmith from Ludhiana. Preeti. Daughter of a fisherman from Saurashtra. These girls… Have used their struggles as their strength. And your strength is your technique. Use that. Use your technique as your weapon. Life has been a furnace for them. They're all heated up. If you connect with them as water, you'll evaporate. If you wish to connect with them, you must be like iron! Come on. Melt yourself. Blend in, so that every time you play with them, they should see a storm coming. Come on, come on, Jhorna! Come on! Come on. Catch it. There it goes. Come on, guys. Next ball, next ball, Jhorna. Come on, Jhorna. Run! Run! - It's okay. Come on, Jhorna! - Witch! Nilu, she's playing on the back foot. Pitch the ball up. Break her. Come on, Nilu. Catch! Oh, God. Come on. What are you doing, girls? It's okay. It's okay. Come on! Come on! It's slowing down! Hurry! Come on! Sresha! But she was good. She's alright. Well played, Mithali. If you play well during the Ireland selection game, you can be the youngest player ever, to represent India. Got it? Keep it up. - So, this is the final list? - Yeah. Okay. Aren't we short on spinners, ma'am? None of the United Services players play spin well. Anamika's been bowling well. We could select her. But the selection is for the England-Ireland tour, right? Let's focus on medium pacers. Isn't Mithali too fresh? She's recently joined the team. Let's see. By the way, the only thing that matters on the ground, is performance. The rest is just theory. If you're good, you're good. That's it. Ma'am! Thank you, ma'am. Come on, Sukumari! Damn! Sukumari Di's gotten out as well. And we need to score 70 more runs! What are we gonna do? WCB is gonna lose to United and we're gonna embarrass ourselves. They are bowling pretty well. If Sukumari Di couldn't handle it, do you really think Ms. Delicate can? Yes! No! - What the hell! - Go back! What the hell are you doing? You bloody... Hurry back and play. Focus on the ball! - Open you bloody eyes! - What the hell is she doing? Focus, Mithali! - Come on. - Stop, don't run! What is she doing? - Open your eyes! - Are you sure you can play?! What are you doing?! Is she crazy? Are you sure you can play?! Good shot. Sresha, you've got to admit that she's got guts. Yeah, at least she's playing for the team. Very good. Keep going! - Good shot! - Get on the front foot! Well played. Hey! Did she push her? What's going on? You got a problem with me? What's wrong? Bravo. Bravo, Jhorna. - God! What the hell is going on? - What are you doing? - That's the second time she's done it! - What the hell! Are you blind? She's pushing me. Are you blind? Are the umpires blind? - Umpires, what is this? - No, they are from United. Say something, sir. - Well done! - That's more like it! Hit her! Come on! Are you blind? - How dare you push me?! - Hey! - What's going on? - Come on! - Hey did she... - Come on! It wasn't my fault. You started it! Get her! - Why did she hit her?! - No, stop. Why did she hit her?! I'm going home. I need to start packing. Hey, Ms. Delicate! You turned out to be pretty hard. Making a debut for India at such young age. - Bravo! Well done! - Well done! We're proud of you, child. - All the best. - Bye. Go, play. The real game begins now. Play well. Make India proud. Sir, this is your boarding pass. Please proceed to gate number nine. I'm single mother. Can you please help me with the check-in? Sure. Please come. She's traveling alone with the child. Sure, please come forward, ma'am. Ma'am, please if you… Just a second. If you don't mind? Can I take them first? - I'm having fun. - I'm not sure. Where's Nilu? Okay, here you go. You have a safe flight. - I love kids, you know. - Hi! - He's so cute! - Hi! Hi… Oh, my God! What are you doing? Hey, Nilu. - Hey! - What are you doing?! - This is my group. - Calm down. Oh, my God! - God, I'm tired. - She's wearing a bloody sweater! Aren't you feeling stuffy? It's going to be cold in England. So, you're already wearing one? Ms. Marwah, you have excess baggage of ten kgs. Please make the excess payment right there, at the last counter, and come back for check-in. If that's okay? Ten kg excess baggage payment? Yes, please have a look. You can either adjust the baggage or pay the amount. Kit bag and warm clothes. We're going to England. What can we leave behind? - We're the national team. - Ma'am, that's for you to decide. Please… I'm sorry, if you don't mind. What's happening? - Ma'am, the trolley. - You move it. Can I have your passport - and ticket as well? - Where's she going? With her luggage? Baggage here, please. Ma'am, yours is also seven kgs excess. I'm so sorry, but you'll have to… Sir, could you please let it slide? Yes, it's just seven kilograms. I can't do much. Ma'am, it just rules. So… How will we lighten the weight? God. Group check-in is better. Passport. It's okay, ma'am. Your baggage is overweight as well. - What's wrong? - What's going on? Wait a second, ma'am? - Are you guys with them? - Yes. Can you all please move to this side? You're causing inconvenience to other passengers, and it's just rude. So, first fix the weight of your bags, and get back in line. Okay? Okay? Please, move. Everyone with her, please, move. - Okay, fine. - What are we gonna do? Yes, sir. Can you please come forward? I don't know. Let's have a look. Let's get rid of everything! How can we… get rid of everything? What are we going to wear out there in the cold? We'll have to reduce the weight. Or he won't let us through. Get rid of all the sweaters and jackets. What does he want us to do? Let's leave everything behind and go to England naked. - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! I can't sleep. Yeah. Let's go outside. The bloody shawl isn't helping! - I am freezing! It's so cold. - Are we allowed out here? Of course! - Why would we need permission? - Let's go. - I'm gonna freeze to death! - Can we get disqualified... - Don't be scared, Mithu. - Stop over thinking. Sit down. Man! God, it's cold out here. It's so beautiful. The stars are clearly visible! Right? Just like lamps on Diwali. There's no pollution here. Fill this place up with rickshaws, cars, and buses, and then you'll see. How will you ever see the stars amidst the bloody smog? But did you know that most of these stars… Are already dead. Their light takes time to reach us. Nonsense! Do you think we're dumb because we're from small towns? English-medium. No, seriously. I read it in school. - Really? - Yes, I did read it in school. What's the point of shining… After you're dead? And the condition of the women's cricket team… Is even more pathetic. No one will ever see us shine. Mithu… Why did you come here if you're so well-read? Why did you choose this "gentleman's game"? I was eight when someone showed me a dream. "There's gonna be a day where cricket won't just be a gentleman's game. We'll have a team like the Men in Blue. "Women in Blue." Don't show us dreams that won't let us sleep. But your dreams should be the ones that don't let you sleep, right? Come on. Again. Wow! Good catch. Great catch. Hello? Sukumari? Yes, Shanta ma'am. There is a bad news. Sam path is no more. Bike accident. What... Don't tell Mithali yet. It's her first match. Break the news to her after the match. I understand, ma'am. Come on, girls. Everyone, make a circle. Come, come. As we know, it's a very important day for us, and we have four debutantes. First is Reshma Gandhi. - Well done, Reshma! - Bravo! Bravo, Reshma. All the best. Do well. Second is Mithali Raj. Bravo, Mithali! - Well done, Mithali! - All the best. Good shot! Smashing performance! The youngest female Indian cricketer to debut with a century. Look at this ground. It's just like life. Every pain seems inferior once you're out there. The game is all that matters. Play. The dawn says to the dew You are the beginning The healer says to the wound You are the beginning The autumn, the monsoon… Come and go Keep your desires alive Like the blossoming buds You are the beginning You are the beginning - Yeah! - Come on, Mithali! Well done! At such a young age, you've broken Karen Rolton's record for the highest score in a test innings in women's cricket, you must be delighted? I would've been happier if we had won the match in the series, instead of a draw. But nevertheless, I would like to share this moment with my teammates. The path of life Full of twists and turns Can't stop because of pain When hurdles try to scare you Can't bow before the hurdles The pitch is pathetic. This was definitely gonna happen. Flapping her wings And with every ounce of courage She soared high again Up in the sky She's flying high Breaking free She soared high again We've won! Up in the sky Congratulations, Mithali. - Thank you. - She's flying high Breaking free Silly of me to ask you how you're feeling, but tell me, Mithali, what does that hundred mean to you? It's always nice to get some runs under the belt. But more importantly, the team played well and we won. Now, Mithali, you've been the torchbearer for women's cricket. Is there a message you have for everyone out there? I would like to say this to CAI. That they supported the men's team for 20 years since 1932, before they got their first victory. We're only asking for five. Mister, when's the next stop? Hurry up. But Nilu, we'll have toilets on the ground, right? There's nothing out there. Let's go this way. - No, let's just do it here. - Yeah, let's go. Here? - Are you sure? - Sit down. - Sit down. - But… - Sit. Sit. - This is… Sorry, ma'am. This is our plan for the year. - Everyone got it, right? - Yes, ma'am. Everything clear? Yes, ma'am. This is the plan? Three one-days, one test match, and a couple of small-time matches. Fewer the games, the lesser the match fees. Nonsense! - After this meeting, we'll talk to… - Ma'am! Why aren't we playing more matches this year? - Ma'am. - What? Thank you. I was saying, why aren't we playing more matches this year? This affects our fitness, right? We're trying. What can I do? We have no sponsors. WCB doesn't have the budget. You all know that, right? Ma'am, I have an idea. All our problems can be solved if WCB partners with CAI. After all, CAI is the richest sporting body in the world. Are you the treasurer of CAI? "Partner with CAI." You should be grateful for what you're getting. She hasn't said anything wrong. It's a great idea. - She is right. - Yes, she is. CAI does have money. Yes, ma'am. If we have CAI on board, they could help us with our match fee as well. Right. Ma'am, I'll talk to the team later. Let's go, girls. Why talk later? Everyone's life depends on it. Let's find a solution together. A couple of centuries under the belt, and you're arguing with your captain. Wait a minute, Sukumari, let her speak. Yes. All I'm trying to say is, if we want to build a strong women's team, we need more matches. We need international exposure. We need support. And CAI can give us that support… If we all try collectively. Aren't you getting enough support already? Forget her. Ma'am… Ma'am, I really think we need a full-time male coach. Someone like San deep Patil or Wadekar sir. It'll take our fitness and game to the next level, ma'am. Great. Male coach. Are you out of your mind? No, I'm not. And you know it, Sukumari Di. Ma'am, Mithali is right. In Sampat sir's academy… Get your head out of Sampath's academy! Enough! I have an important announcement to make. We have a new captain. In fact, she's the youngest captain of the Indian cricket team ever. Congratulations! Very good. Very good. - Bravo, Mithali! - Well done! Come on. Let's go! Come on! Congrats! Dear, sir. Every lane in this country has a place for cricket. Can women's cricket get some space as well? Every boy dreams about playing for India. Shouldn't girls dream about it as well? Our underpaid cricketers are preparing on unprepared pitches to take on the world. The success of Indian cricket is skyrocketing. But national players are forced to use open fields… Because we don't have access to toilets. This can change. With you by our side, we can conquer the world. Captain Mithali Dorai Raj. The dark nights have passed The pain has receded The smoke has finally cleared Why are you still upset? The tears have dried up No more traces of tears in them What's done is done What's gone is gone Don't be emotional The world makes you sweat Don't know why You're not allowed to stop Even if your desires are not fulfilled You're not allowed to be depressed Throw a short pitch. With all her mustered strength Flapping her wings And with every ounce of courage There she goes She soared high again -Up in the sky -Back. Back. Right here. -She's flying high -Alright. -Breaking free -Look, when you… let it bounce… She soared high again Up in the sky - Come on, Roma. Get behind the ball. - She's flying high, breaking free Fast! Fast! Good! Good! Fast! Fast! Come on! Come on! Superb, girls! Come on! Fast! Fast! Destroying all the hurdles Belittling all her pain Leaving everything behind Leaving her fear behind Rise up from your pain And spread your wings She soared high again Up in the sky She's flying high, breaking free Right! Right! - Hurry! Run! - Come on! Be careful. Destroying all the hurdles Belittling all her pain Leaving everything behind Leaving her fear behind Rise up from your pain And spread your wings She soared high again She's flying high, breaking free And the conditions here are so different, from what y'all are used to playing in, how do you overcome such heavy odds? Indian women's cricket team is no less in skill and technique. Yes, there were a few gaps. Like fitness and handling the swing in English conditions, but we tackled it as a team. The men's team is also in England currently, and they haven't had a good time. They lost their previous match. Y'all have won your match and some comparisons will become inevitable. You win some, you lose some. Thank you. Mithali. Richard Linkletter, The Daily Willow. Who is your favorite male cricketer? Do you ask the same question to a male cricketer? Do you ask him who his favorite female cricketer is? Please go ask that first. Let's just take anyone's bag. There's your bag. - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! Sir… one photo, please. Let's take another proper photo. - Just give me one minute. - Okay. -Sir, one selfie, sir, -Sir! Excuse me, ma'am. Can you please take our picture? Please. Thank you. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you, sir. - This way, sir. - Thank you. You would've noticed us Instead of staring Had you looked closely for once You would've noticed us You would've noticed our paths You would've noticed our footprints On those paths Instead of staring Had you looked closely for once You would've noticed us You could've seen the difficulties The troubles you are ignorant about You would have felt that pain too Pains you have never borne You would have found them Instead of staring Had you looked closely for once You would've noticed us You would've noticed us Relax. The Cricket Association is ready for the merger. Congratulations, captain. Wow! Show me. Mithali. CAI has sent it! It must be something special. Hats off to you Mithali. What are you doing? Hurry! Get the box. Wow, captain. Look! What is it? But… These look old. Check the back of your T-shirt. - Old T-shirts? - Your T-shirt as well? - Yeah. - This one reads, "Mahendar". These aren't even the right size, ma'am. How are we going to wear these? Ma'am, these belong to boys. Was there a mistake? No. This is what we've got. What do you mean by, "This is it"? Mithali, what is this? Show me. Show it. Cost-cutting. A couple of matches every year. We'll play one-days only when the other countries invite us. Nonsense. Coach Unni is out. The new coach for CAI's women's team is Sukumari Marwah. I want to meet the CAI chief. We saw a ray of hope when we were told that CAI is supporting us. Our needs are really basic, sir. More matches, travel facilities, shoes, kits. Clothes that have our names on the back! That's it. Sir, we have an identity as well. We play for India as well, sir. Yes, sir? How long have you been working here, Bala? Sir… Thirty years. Have I made a mistake, sir? Do you like cricket? Cricket is my life, sir. And I'm proud to work for those who play for our country. Sir, I've met all the cricketers! And I have their autographs as well. Sir, I have a bat signed by Gavaskar sir. A bat he had used to score a century! Fine. Name any five women cricketers. Sorry, sir. Any three. No, sir. Any two? Give me one name, man. Go. There's your identity. Sir, they won't get any sponsors. I had warned you before the merger. Women's cricket team is a dry well. Exactly, sir. In fact, let's send the male cricketers' wives and girlfriends instead. We should spend on them, sir. Sponsors will line up at our door. Right. It will also boost the morale of the boys. Exactly. Nice. In that case, sir… let me introduce you to my team. Mithali Dorai Raj… What are you doing? Jersey number 3. - Jhorna Ghosh. - Hello?! Jersey… 85. What's going on here? Nilu Paswan. Excuse me. Jersey number 8. Khushi Anvekar. Jersey number 47. Himakshi Ganesh an. Jersey number 19. Sresha Badyal. Jersey number 14. - Kajal Sutar. Jersey number 00. - Jersey number 6! Now you know who we are… Sir. I got their hopes up. Tried repeatedly, for CAI to notice us. If this was the end result, I was wrong. I was wrong to bring you all along on this path. There's no point in being called a captain. And there's no reason to play cricket. Because I wasn't able to change anything here. I have lost. I have failed. Hey! Mithu… What a surprise! Grandma was right. Mithun should've played, not me. The lanes that I've quit Why do they call me back? Why is God testing us? The lanes that I've left behind Why do we miss them again? Why do they give us sleepless nights? We want to go across But how do we go? How do we get up every time we fall? How do we not give up every time we lose? How do we stop, Lord? These shattered dreams… These shattered dreams… Pierce through my heart These shattered dreams… My dreams The path shall soon fade From my sight The legs will learn To be calm Soon… the others will know That I've bid my dreams goodbye The lanes that we turned to ashes Why do they burn me from inside? The lanes that we skipped Why do they become a hurdle again? Why do you break my heart, Lord? We want to go across But how do we? How do we get up every time we fall? How do we not give up every time we lose? How do we stop, Lord? These shattered dreams… These shattered dreams… Pierce through my heart These shattered dreams… My dreams Those lanes… Hello? Hi, Mithu. Thank God you answered the phone. How are you? Happy. I was making dosas. Now I can make round and crisp ones! They don't stick to the pan either. How are you guys? We're getting battered like dosas. We're losing matches and Sukumari's screwing us. Mithu… Nothing seems right ever since you left. Everyone's quitting, - and... - Nilu's getting married as well. Great. Mithu. Let's meet. Will you be home on Saturday? We're coming to Hyderabad. Fine. I'll see you in the evening. I need to finish some chores in the morning. Okay, fine. We'll see you. Bye. Bye. Have you thought about my marriage? Are you okay? What... Don't you want to see me get married? - Hello, uncle. - It's been a long time. Come in. Mithu. Hey, good timing. Come with me. Where? And what's wrong with you? New look. Off to meet a guy. Will you come along? What? Do you want lipstick? Lipstick? Look, she won't face any restrictions. We're all broadminded. - Non-vegetarian food is allowed. - Really? She's allowed to work after they get married as well! Yoga classes are allowed. Cooking classes are allowed. She's allowed to wear western dresses on holidays. - Western dresses are allowed… - Most importantly… When you marry Subodh, you're allowed to go on one trip with Subodh alone. What about playing cricket after marriage? Jhorna! What? Hasn't Mithali quit cricket? It's not what you think. She can definitely play. Sometimes… I played cricket as a hobby when I was a kid as well. It's a great sport. What if she wants to play every day? Every day… Here's a question… If you have a crucial match, and Mom's sick, will you still play? - You tell me. - Yeah? Imagine you're in the army. War breaks out at the border. At the same time, your mom ends up getting paralyzed. Will you stay with your mom or go to war? Mithu? Are snacks allowed? Of course! My stomach hurts… Remember the things we dreamt of that night? Nilu will leave us soon. I feel… the light of those stars has stopped reaching us. Have you thought about what you're going to wear to Nilu's wedding? You call this cricket? You expect to be felicitated? We've lost all the matches one after another. England, Australia, and New Zealand are winning consistently. As for us, we're setting a new record of losing. World Cup is around the corner. If you can't help the team, pack your bags and leave. A team's made of two things. Players and team spirit. But the one who generated the team spirit of the Women in Blue isn't on the team. The one who you thought was your competitor, is actually your trump card. But you've never understood this. But you have time. This world cup is your last chance. If you fail this time… Think about it. Hello… Mithali? Who is it? Cute, right? It's okay! Look who's here! It's okay. Who asked you to hit a six so hard? The boys will show up and make a scene! And I'll have to beat them up… With my bare hands. Noorie! Why are you here now? You didn't show up the day you were supposed to. Or are you trying to show me how happy you are? You have a house, a family. Yeah, you quit cricket, but you've got a great life. Go on. Say it. Let it all out. I fought! But I couldn't win against Father. What could I do? I wasn't destined to play cricket. My dreams were shattered. But watching you play made me happy. I've saved all your newspaper clippings. I couldn't contain my excitement when they made you the captain. When you're on the pitch, you're not just playing for yourself, Mithu. You fulfill the dreams of every Noorie, who couldn't make it to that ground. Don't quit. Play till the end. Nilu. Nilu. She was right here. - Where did she go? - Let's check there. Over there. - She isn't in there? - No, she's not. Nilu? Nilu. Is the wedding procession here? We are here. Come on. - Come on. - Come on! Let's go. - Get up. - Come on. - Where are we going? - Calm down. Just come with us. - We're friends. - Where are we going? - Come on! - Where are you taking me? Come on. Where are we going? - Come with us! - One minute. Be quiet. Careful. Be careful. Look. - What's going on? - Listen. You've got to play the World Cup. Let's go. Have you guys lost your mind? What? You wanted to win the World Cup, right? Oh, God! Nilu… Look, we won't get this opportunity again. Look at the occasion, you morons! But… You guys have completely lost it. Who's going to get married if I leave? My mom? Nilu, you're the best off-spinner in the whole country. Come on. He's Chandan. Chandan, they are… Hello, Chandan. Nilu… Do you… Do you really want to continue playing cricket? Yes. Please do. No one's stopping you. It'll be much more fun if you play as Mrs. Nilu. But… You must promise me one thing. I… I… I want to meet Sachin. Really? First, meet this Sachin. Captain Mithali Dorai Raj. Hello. Hi. Hi. You finally won. Sampat sir once told me a story. About a player. She showed up on the ground at 6:00 a.m. for practice, the day after her husband died. A fan can never win against her idol. She can only learn. Where the hands are Go the eyes Where the eyes are Goes the mind Where the mind goes There is expression Where there is expression Feeling is evoked We want to carry you With pride And make you known All over the world India, you're my heart India, you're my heart My life's dedicated to you I love my country India, you're my heart India, you're my heart. My life's dedicated to you I love my country Your beloved child's off To face the storms A butterfly's trying to cover The sky with her wings The opening game of the Women's World Cup. The live action is just around the corner here. And England winning the toss and having the opportunity to bowl first to get their world cup campaign underway. We're facing a strong team. - It's gonna be tough. - I know, man. Is everything alright? We need to pitch up. Yeah, but I'm really scared. Don't worry We have to play very carefully. It's alright. We will win. You can be a little nervous. It's normal. Let's see what happens. - Yes. - Yeah. Okay, girls. Listen up. Come here. So, what's the worst that can happen today? There are no two ways about that, sister? What can be worse than losing? Obviously, we're playing to win. Who plays to lose? But the worst that can happen is… People forget who we are, yet again. So, whether we win or lose, we'll make sure… No one forgets our identity after today's game. It's the World Cup. We have to defeat New Zealand, England, Australia, and Pakistan. It's a difficult journey. But no one's had it easy. For 16 years, Kavita played cricket on the streets as a boy. Was it easy? And you traveled 80 kilometers every day, Jhorna. Just to make it to practice. Was it easy? Bowling 20 overs after roughing it out at the sea for six hours. Every day. Was it easy, Veda? Despite these hurdles, we made it here. Some of us… Might never play again. I might never play again. So… If you know that this can be your last tournament, how will you play? We'll pour our hearts into it. Like it's the last day of our lives. That's how we play. - Yes. - Yes. So, today when we play out there, people won't see numbers. They will only see one color. Blue! Yes, girls. Come on. - Who are we? - Women in Blue! - Who are we? - Women in Blue! - Who are we? - Women in Blue! - Who are we? - Women in Blue! - Who are we? - Women in Blue! Your beloved child's off To face the storms A butterfly's trying to cover the sky With her wings Head held high and a restless courage History will say… Our daughters won the game Anoint your soil on our foreheads We wanna be called the best India, you're my heart India, you're my heart My life's dedicated to you I love my country I love my country I love my country I love my country It's England vs. India, the opening day of the 11th edition of the Women's World Cup. Well placed. Out. Gone. …to target the English bowlers. And she picks up a boundary and that's it for another fifty. Yet another fifty for Mithali Raj, the captain of the Indian team. Leading by example… 282 the target then, after India lost only three wickets. Gone. Caught and bowled. Now then, hesitation. Oh, it's a direct hit! - Catch it, Veda. Catch it! - Goes big again! - Well caught! - What a wonderful catch… To finish off the opening round, India! A historical win for India as they've taken out England, the home team. Welcome to Taunton for the Women's World Cup match, between the West Indies and India. Oh, it's the gap. That's enough, son. I've shown you pictures of several girls. You must've liked someone. Full. Punished! I was saying… Are you listening? I am talking to you! Mom, I'm watching the match. Another boundary. And they win their second Women's World Cup match by seven wickets. …lays out the red carpet for the clash of the Asian arch-rival. - Howazzat! - Wow, that swing! This is it, yes. Mithali Raj is on her way. We've never lost a World Cup match against Pakistan, right? These girls will embarrass us this time. This women's cricket is bad news, boss. They could've smashed it in the last five overs. They could've taken the score to 200. Things we've to see in the name of "women's liberation". They're wasting it! People's time. Country's time. Totally waste. Change it. Switch to FashionTV. Change it. Come on. That side. Nilu, come on. What's wrong with Shikha? They will win even if they last 40 overs. We need wickets. The pitch has changed in the last ten overs. Let's tempt them with spinners. But there's a risk of getting smashed around. It's better than regretting it after three overs. Surprised by this? Not opening both ends with seamers? Howazzat?! - Given, given. - Yes! Yes! Well, it's worked. This combination of pace and spin for India. That's struck in front. There's a chance here! And it's been given! Given directly! Yes! Yes! Yes! Come on! Another appeal. Another appeal. And another wicket. India just keep rubbing salt - into the wound of Pakistan. - Yes! Slower ball, might shape. They've all gone up. Oh, it's going to be a referral. She's bowled well with the new ball and well with the old ball. Mansi Joshi just wrapped things up for India. And they make it ten wins out of ten in ODIs against Pakistan. But they've defended it with plenty of runs in the end. - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! They defeated Pakistan? This is like winning the World Cup for me, man. Another fine day in Derby, welcomes India and Sri Lanka to the cozy county ground. Got this one through as well. Yeah. That is an area… Mithali Raj does not miss out. Yeah! That will be the single for the fifty. A 48th one-day international half-century for the Indian captain. It's in the air and out. And a victory for India. South Africa against India coming to you live from Leicester. India have won four out of four. Oh, what a sight! Off-stump is gone. Lofted. Lofted. That's monstrous! South Africa finish 273 for 9. Oh, look at this. Captain to captain. And the Proteas' captain wins it hands down. With a heavy defeat to South Africa, their journey towards the semi-final is on uncertain footing. Today, it's match 23, Australia against India. That is lovely. Should be a boundary. - Wow! Great shot! - Good one. What a great shot. In the air… Drops short! Well, she will get her fifty. Mithali Raj. 6002 runs in her illustrious career. That is the shot of the morning. And Australia will have a shortish target to go out there and chase, I think 227. That's a cracking cover drive. It's nicely struck. It's so nicely struck. It will bring up a boundary and bring up the win for Australia. Shit, man. We won the first four but we've now lost two! One team will be staying, the other will be going home. It's India vs. New Zealand at Derby. Nice. Too much width. - This girl's playing really well. - Yes. Isn't she... How can I forget her name? - Sir, Mithali Raj. - Mithali Raj. Swung away, this is a chance. No, it won't carry, won't carry. Catch! Oh, lovely. Very, very, nice. They go for the second, they get it comfortably in the end. And Raj gets her hundred. That's her sixth ODI hundred. Look! Taken! Straight back! Oh, it's gone! - Catch! - Take it! Gone! Gone. - That is it. That is it. - Bowled out! - Yes! - They are into the semi-finals now. Mithali Raj leading with yet another hundred. It's Australia vs. India, semi-final number two is live from Derby. On the charge does Raj go and she plays this beautifully. Yeah! Shot! Now then, that's six! And India's innings finish a daunting 281 for 4. Knocked her clean over. The off-stump is gone. That is special. That's a beauty. That is a beauty. What a start. That's gone through. That's four. Catch. - Oh, through the hands. - Come on. - Catch it. - Villani… Gone! - Catch it. - Lot of turn there and out! - Down to midwicket. - Catch it. Catch it. Catch it. And taken. Yeah! Another clean strike. That's another one. Same direction. - Yeah! - Yes! And the final wicket has fallen. Remember 1983? And it's 2017 now. The women will be playing the World Cup final at Lords. And this has been a story in itself. India getting through rank number four, had to play the qualifiers in Sri Lanka. Came to England, wasn't the fancied team to get into the final four. Not only did they manage to get there, they also beat three strong teams on their way. And they are in the finals now. We are all set for the final of the 2017 ICC Women's World Cup. England vs. India from Lords. That's close. That's close. Worth a shout. - It's plumb! It's plumb! - Sushma Verma and Mithali Raj, are they goin... They are going to review this. It's the DRS review. And wickets hitting. Yes, that's out. Everything going right for India. Down the leg side. There's an appeal here. But don't think the umpire... Oh, the umpire! That's worth a shout. Yes, it is. This should be a direct hit. Yes! And she gets it. Well done. Keeps it simple. Not easy to do when you're bowling that last over of the innings, So, the young 19-year-old does another brilliant job for her side. Just seven runs off the last over. England batting first. Scores 228 for 7! India, led magnificently by Mithali Raj, must be really fancying their chances of lifting the World Cup for the first time. That is the end of… Right on target for Anya Shrubsole! Just what England needed. Early wicket. Yes! - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! - India! India! Great shot. Four. What a shot. There's another one. That is a great blow as well. Have to go. And... Now, that's very close. It's Mithali Raj. This will be horrible for India. The India captain is gone. This could be really, really bad for India. Will she take the single to bring up the fifty in her first world cup final? - Yes, she will. - Well done, Poonam! Well played, Poonam Raut. Stay! Gone. That is a crushing blow for India. Down the ground this time, she's got plenty on it for four! That's a decent shout. She's got her! Around the legs. Shouts! Another wicket falls. It's gone straight up. Fielder coming under it. Another slog from Veda Krishnamurthy. Oh, bowled! Gone through. Just 11 more needed, can India do it? Halfway down the pitch. This is going to be a run out! Has she collected the ball? The bails are certainly off. She has. But India losing wickets… - Catch! - It's gone up in the air. Could be out. Yes. Taken. Deepti Sharma is gone. It's gone up. And could be out. No, dropped! Bowled! Was the last player. You can expect something like that to happen. So, England have won the World Cup. And the fourth time they have done that. And what a match this was.
