- Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes Call the officers. Company at ease! Forward. Officers halt! - Company at ease! - Company at ease! Company at ease! Gentlemen. On the whole it was very creditable. The drill was satisfactory and the men in good form. But... remember the hooks on the collars. The hooks on the collars. Thank you. I remind the general to see Lieutenant Van Leer. Lieutenant Van Leer. I've received from your colonel a regrettable report of your conduct. I hope it's not necessary to remind an officer of the Imperial Guard... ...of the importance of a debt of honor. Do I make myself clear? Gentlemen. - Until after rifle inspection. - That's it. - Yes, sir. - Fine. Lieutenant Kasder. - At ease. - How do you do, Uncle? None of your nonsense! Look here, Willi. I have had an interview with the regimental adjutant. Yes, sir. - You've exceeded your allowance again. - Yes, sir. - And I paid your bill. - Yes, sir! And this time it's absolutely the last time. - Yes, sir. - Don't stand there grinning at me! Yes, sir. Now, my boy. A definite engagement with Emily Kessner... ...will put your affairs on a different footing. - Yes, sir. - Well? Why don't you settle it? - I will, sir. - When? - Whenever you say, sir. - Well, I say this week. And no more of your bright excuses. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon... Uncle. Agh! What was it, Willi, a reprimand? No, but it will be. Oh, Von Leer, Von Leer! Von Leer! Ah, whither away, infatuous youth. I wish they wouldn't ride the boy so. Oh. I hear he's in some sort of trouble about money. Who isn't? - You too? - Yes. And the worst of it all is... that the only way I can get out of money trouble... ...is by getting into matrimonial trouble. - Hello, Josef. - Yes, sir. Um... beg your pardon, sir. I, um... You were in such a hurry this morning, I didn't get that chance to ask you. Did you have a nice time last night, sir? It started out well... But it ended quite abruptly. - Oh, did her, um... - Yes, Josef. I met her husband. Was the explanation quite satisfactory, sir? Josef, he was the most unreasonable husband I've ever met. Some husbands are funny that way, sir. Nothing funny about this one. A big man, sir? Not so big. But, oh, what a man to lie to. I see, small but suspicious. Suspicious, Josef? The man was a psychoanalyst. Well, Hercules, where's that soap? - Yes, sir, yes, sir. Well, Willi, it's lucky for the husbands of Vienna... ...that you're going to get married and settle down. Who said I was going to settle down? - Give me the sponge! - Yes, sir. Anybody'd think you weren't in love with Emily. Well, her father is worth 17 million gulden. But you do love her, don't you? Otto, you're all mixed up. Love has nothing to do with marriage. - No? - No. Love is women. The excitement of the chase. The thrill of conquest. Love! Ah, love... is an interlude! - A what? - An interlude of brief, bitter bliss. - Bitter? - Bitter bliss, yes. Between facing a new mystery... ...and the dissolution when it comes with its solution. Give me a towel, Josef. Is that my underwear? Um, um... yes, sir. You see, the laundry shrunk them and I'm trying to stretch them, sir. Hm... you seem to like them. I think they're beautiful. You think you've stretched them enough? Yes, sir, I think they're about right now, sir. - Take them off! - Yes, sir, right away, sir, yes, sir. - Did you hear that? - Yes. That came from Lieutenant Van Leer! - What? Let's see! - It sounded like a shot. Get up! At ease, gentlemen. It is my duty to inform you, gentlemen, Lieutenant Erich Von Leer, confronted by a question of honor, has answered it like a gentleman and an officer. I wish to propose a toast, gentlemen. A toast to our late comrade Erich Van Leer, and to the spirit of His Majesty's Guard. Aren't you through yet? - I'll have you finished in a minute, sir. - That's what I'm afraid of. Ouch! I... I'm sorry, sir. The towels were too hot to hold. About face! One pace to the rear. March! - Thank you, sir. - You're welcome. Come in. - Hello. - It's 6 o'clock, better hurry, hadn't you? - Hurry? - Yes, you oughtn't to be late tonight. The lamb ready to be led to the slaughter? What are you... - Why, it's Wednesday. - It's Thursday! - No. - Yes. - No. - Yes. No! It's Thursday the 26th. The night of your engagement party. Quick, quick, Josef, I'm late! And I was planning an evening at Mme. Sacher's. If you're going to start talking about Sacher's, - you'll go to your reception alone. - You've got to stick by me! Oh, we'll stick, but you'd better appreciate it. Get out of here! I'm busy, get out of here. Josef. Deliver this note at seven. Herr and Fr?u Counsellor Von Bulow, Lieutenant, Kasder. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - Congratulations, monsieur. - Thank you. Herr and Fr?u chief of the German Legation, Von Adler, Lt. Kasder. - Congraulations. - Thank you. - Congratulations, Lieutenant. - Thank you. Herr and Fr?u bank director Friedlander, Lt. Kasder. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - Congratulations, Lieutenant. - Thank you. - Are there many more? - I hope not. Oh, dance music. Let us join them in the quadrille. Very well. - Don't you like the quadrille? - Nothing thrills me more. Take off that smile and rest your face, darling. If being engaged is such a bore... ...how are you ever going to stand being married? - I assure you I am... - Charmed? Exactly. Anything you wish, sir? I have to deliver this letter to Herr Lt. Kasder. Personally. Herr Lt. Kasder... personally. Pardon me. I must report at once. Orders. I must report at once. Orders. I'm awfully sorry. Please forgive me. - We must report at once. - Why? - We must report at once. - What's the matter? Is anything wrong? What is this order? Emergency order for the Third Battalion. Report at 9:30 for special night duty at Madame Sacher's. Madam Sacher's? Don't you recognize the handwriting? - Oh, a genius! - Mastermind. - Madame Sacher's? - Madame Sacher's? Madame Sacher's! - No creditors? - Only Madame Sacher. I'll fill her with kindness. - Willi, you're late. - I'll make up for lost time. Ah, Henri, did you put the Archduke in number 14? - His Highness preferred number 16. - Oh! Well, how are you all? Good evening. Well, good evening. Hello, Tillie. Business good? Well, the poor person had pups on the doorsteps. How's everything over here? Is everything all right? Marvelous, Tillie. - Good evening, Highness. - Ah, Tillie... - Has my party arrived? - They're waiting for Your Highness. - Number 16. - Oh, good. Oh... were you waiting for someone? Yes. Herr Schnabel told me he'd get me some music to score for the orchestra. I'll tell him, my dear, as soon as I see him. Here you are, honey. Special treat for you. - Good evening, everybody. - Hello, Tillie! Say, will you have a little drink with us? Later perhaps. Is everything all right? Perfectly. - I'm glad you aren't on duty tonight. - Are you? You ought to know. - Schnabel's coming. - Oh! Oh, Honey, now listen, don't be rude to him. - He's doing me a favor. - At twenty percent. Good evening, good evening, gentlemen. Out for a little fun, eh, Lieutenant? Hope you won't do anything I wouldn't do. We're going to do something you couldn't do. Go ahead. I like to see young men enjoy themselves. When I was a young fellow, I was too busy with these goings on. It isn't possible you are going to join us, Herr Schnabel. Well, as a matter of fact I came over... ...to ask you boys to drink a glass of wine with me. Thanks, we have some wine. Nonsense, I don't mean that dish water. Waiter! Hey, waiter! What's the matter with you, are you deaf? Sorry, sir. Don't be sorry, sir, be sprite, sir. - Bring me a bottle of liebfr?umilch '31. - Yes, sir. Make it two. Remember, '31. - The kind that costs 29 gulden a bottle. - Good old Schnabel. - Oh, Schnabel. - Herr Schnabel! Excuse me a minute, gentlemen. I have some important business to attend to. Be sure to come back, won't you? Don't worry. Why did you ask him to come back? Twenty-nine gulden a bottle. - Well, aren't you hungry? - Yes. - What are we waiting for? - I'm starved. Look! Herr Schnabel started a kindergarten? Yes, he graduates them directly from the nursery to a maiden and bigamist. People don't know half his charities either. I guarantee he's taking her up there to buy her a raspberry sherbet. A raspberry sherbet? And she's so young. Now, that's something I won't stand for. Don't interfere, Herr Schnabel might be annoyed. Now, this is done is in the interest of higher education. Now... you don't know when you have a good friend? Yes, Herr Schnabel. You've been awfully kind about getting work for me. Talking about work, when I'm ready to give you anything. - But I don't want anything. - Don't be a little fool. Everybody wants everything. Now, now, listen. Please, Herr Schnabel, please, please! I beg your pardon. Oh, it's the lieutenant in there... Well... If Willi comes out of there with a black eye, it will serve him right. Well, three to one Schnabel comes out on his ear. Ten to one Willi comes out with the girl in his arms. Before you came in, it was all very disagreeable. Naturally. Do you know Herr Schnabel intimately? Oh, yes, he's been so kind to me. And then all at once he tried to kiss me. It surprised me so. It doesn't surprise me. Oh, dear me, I... Well, good night, Lt. Kasder. - You are dining with me. - Dining? - Yes. - I can't, thank you. - Why not? - I have an appointment. - I'll break it for you. - But I don't want you to. I'm giving a music lesson at Grinzing. Grinzing? I never had a chance to go to Grinzing! It's quite far. We'll take a carriage. The horse won't mind. You know... really, I couldn't let you do that. - I don't know you. - I don't know you. I'm taking the same chance that you are. I really mustn't come with you any further. Thank you. Good night. Driver, 157, Lindenstrasse. Good night. Good night. - Oh! - Shh! - Thank you, it was lovely. - Wasn't it? A bit chilly, otherwise delightful. Well, good night. - I'll wait here till your lesson is over. - Oh, but I coudn't let you do that. - I'll see you tomorrow then. - I don't think so. If you'll tell me where you live, I'll be at your doorstep with your milk. Oh... but I'm never going to see you again. Oh, you must never, never, never say never. Life is so uncertain. But I really think we ought not to meet again. Very well. Good night, Fr?ulein Taub. Good night, Lt. Kasder. Go back. Giddyup, giddyup. - Good evening, Fr?u Hoffman. - Good evening, Fr?ulein Taub. Ten minutes late. - Come August. - Twelve minutes late. - I'm sorry, but I... - I don't want to learn to play the piano. Oh, August. - Be a good boy. - August! Lazybones. This summer you'll learn to play at least the Maiden's Prayer... ...or I'll know the reason why. Go! This evening, Fr?ulein Taub, you'll stay please twelve minutes later. Of course, Herr Hoffman. Now, we'll commence with the scales. No, no. Put your thumb here. One, two, three... Stupidhead! If you put your thumb again where your thumb doesn't belong, and I'll put my slipper where you'd wish I wouldn't. Come now, try again, darling. Oh, August. Fr?u Hoffman here, yes? Fr?u Hoffman! A colonel. A colonel! Oh, good evening, Herr Captain. - Um, lieutenant. - Good evening, Herr Lieutenant. Good evening. I hope you pardon the intrusion, but I'm calling for my cousin Laura. Your cousin, Herr Lieutenant? - Yes. - Oh, please come in. Oh, Papa, this gentleman is a cousin of our darling Fr?ulein Taub. Please come in, Herr Lieutenant, don't make yourself a stranger. Thank you. Laura. I beg you'll pardon me, but I haven't seen her for such a long time. - And so fond of his little cousin. - Fond of her? The whole family worships Laura. Introduce me, won't you, cousin? Um, this is my cousin, Lieutenant Willi Kasder. Charmed. We are proud, Herr Lieutenant, honored. Mother, bring your chair for the Herr Lieutenant. No, please don't trouble. It's Laura's birthday and our uncle General Von Hertz... - Von Hertz? - General? - Yes, he's giving a dinner in her honor. - In her honor? How charming. Oh, by the way, Aunt Ada won't be able to be with us tonight. But she made me promise to give you a kiss for each one of your birthdays. Which I am about to do with your permission. - Certainly. - Thank you. Oh, go on and kiss him. Charming child. But she can't be over eighteen. But I have it as human nature. I wonder if she could be excused from giving her lesson. - Of course, of course, of course. - Thank you. - We mustn't keep the general waiting. - I wouldn't. But really, Herr Hoffman, I think I'd better go on with the lesson. No lesson, no lesson! Charming child. I'm only sorry to have to be running like this. - Don't mention it. - Come again, Herr Lieutenant. - Of course I'll come. - I'll be pleased to have you come again. Thank you very much. We'd be honored to have you come for dinner, you and your charming cousin. Thank you, thank you very much. - Any evening you like. - Thank you, goodbye. If I had a cousin like you... I'd be ashamed of my grandmother, and my uncle and my aunt, and anybody who had anything to do with it. But think of the position you put me in. - I put you in? - Well, I had to do something, didn't I? Suppose we had never met each other again. I should have been perfectly happy. - You don't mean that. - Mean it? If I ever so much as look in your direction, I... Coming into people's houses... ...where I'm trying to earn my living and everything. Grinning? Going around pretending to be people's cousins, And kissing them! Oh, you're so provoking! - I wish you could see your nose. - My nose? Yes. The tip of it wiggles when you talk. Here I am, sir. - That's the young lady. - Same old young lady? Naturally. What are you waiting for? Giddyup, giddyup! Can I give you a lift? Anywhere at all. I suppose you know you're attracting a great deal of very unfavorable attention. I'm not the one that's attracting the attention. You certainly are. Laura, would you please get into the carriage? Huh? What? Beg your pardon? Oh... oh, well. If you'd rather ride alone, get in. Very well. I will! - Go ahead. - Giddyup. You were delightful walking. But sitting, you're adorable. - Driver, faster, please. - Giddyup, giddyup! Well, of course, I'm not used to this. Even when I was young, I rode. In my baby carriage. Be careful, you'll be killed. What have I to live for? When you treat me like this. Driver, please stop. Whoa, whoa! Very well, get in then. But please understand that I think you're perfectly depraved. - Go ahead. - Giddyup, giddyup! What's the matter with you? Oh, nothing, just a slight attack. Is there anything the matter with your heart? Anything? Why, the thing has gone to pieces. Ever since we were cousins. Do you like moons? Because if you don't, I'm awfully sorry. I ordered this one for you. It's a lovely moon. Thank you. Laura. Have you ever been to a Wine Garden? I hardly ever go anywhere. Why, I haven't been to a Wine Garden... ...since Father took me when I was a little girl. That's funny. We are on our way to one now. - Oh, no! - Oh, yes! Oh, but I couldn't go with you. Oh, Kasder! How are you? You must come and meet Fifi. Our first together. We must drink a toast. To our better acquaintance. Bottoms up and no heel taps. I'm going to tell you a secret. What? I have a feeling I'm falling in love. With whom? Can't you guess? But you've known me such a short time. Love is measured by the thermometer. Not by the calendar. Oh, my heart is beating so fast. Mine too. Perhaps it's the exercise. Perhaps not. Perfectly happy? Even happier than that. Oh, hello. Hello. Would you like to dance with me? Uh... some other time. You should be a little more careful about speaking with strangers. Well, why? Oh... well, you're a stranger too. Oh yes, you are. You're just as much of a stranger as anyone else. Oh dear, now I've hurt your feelings. I wanted us to have such a lovely time and now I've hurt your feelings. I guess I'm not much of a success. Oh, yes, you are. You're a great success. Am I? Am I really? Tell me. Now say it. Say Laura... Laura is a great success. Laura is a great, wonderful, marvelous success. Oh, you're so kind to me. - I'm going to cry. - Oh, now, now, please don't. No... all right. No, I won't cry. I'll be a success. I'm warm. Do you feel warm? No. Why do you suppose I feel so warm? - Maybe you had a little too much... - Oh, I know! I'm thirsty. Please... I'll have another glass of that lovely cool wine. No. You've already had too much. I want another one. No, no, I want quite a full one, please. What is it? Please tell me. - Do you know what? - No, what? I think I've had too much to drink. I think so too. Let's go down by the river. It's cooler there. All right. Going down to the river. I do everything you say, don't I? I'm a fine success. How do you feel? Much better, thank you. Good. Oh, look at the river. So smooth and peaceful. I wish we were swans. Out there in the dark. Floating on, hour after hour... ...under all the bridges. And we'd never make a sound. Daybreak. You are trembling. Have you cold? No... only a little afraid. Why? Because I love you. - This seems to be my breakfast. - Yours? From me. Tell me. What did you think of me when you first saw me? I... I thought you were wonderful. But I was a little frightened. About what? About... What I'd give you for breakfast. Did you think that far ahead? Oh, you haven't eaten your strawberries. Are you trying to reach my heart through my stomach? Why not? You've already reached my heart. Eight o'clock? See what you've done? I have to go back to my duties with only three strawberries and a kiss. What do they do to you if you're late, Willi? Oh, they stand me up in a corner and shoot me. Oh, Willi! Just as handsome as ever. Behave yourself. And don't look at any more handsome lieutenants. I won't, Willi. When are you coming to see me again? - Tomorrow or the next day. - But Willi... Oh... Turn around. Don't peek. - Is she out? - No. All alone in the dark? What were you thinking about? Me? Let me alone. Go away. What's the matter? What's wrong? Nothing I could explain to you. Are you angry with me? Angry? - Laura... - No, don't touch me. I haven't an idea what I've done. An officer in the Emperor's Guard wouldn't. Is it fair not to tell me? Fair? Now that's funny. You know, that's really very funny. No... you don't know, do you? Well, I'll tell you then. - Oh, what's the use? - Please. After all, I can't complain. You were very generous. If I made a mistake, I'm sorry. Honestly. I'm terribly sorry. Because I really love you. And now I know what love is, don't I? Laura, please. You've got to understand I'm not my own master. An officer without money of his own, if he marries, he must marry wisely. And with the Emperor's permission. But he can find love where he likes. And so it's as simple as that. You can find love where you like. All right. I can too. I can find your kind of love where I like. I can find a kind of love you can't afford to give. And I will, I will! - Laura, come back here! - I won't waste a minute! Come back! - Janitor, janitor! - Laura, come back here! Janitor! Oh, Laura, I can't let this happen to you because of me! When I need a protector, it won't be a shabby lieutenant. I'm going to complete my education. Luxuriously. Oh, on duty, Herr Lieutenant. Herr Schnabel, I've decided to accept your invitation. - Really? - Yes. And quite completely. Laura! You don't know what you're doing. - Yes! - You can't know the kind of man he is! I'm a free man. I haven't got any uniform, but I pay my tailor. You shouldn't do it. It's a pretty bad tailor. Please. Come in, Herr Schnabel. If the young man annoys you, we'll call the janitor and have him thrown out. That won't be necessary. You hear? You're not wanted. Good night, Fr?ulein Taub. Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen, place your bets. Place your bets. All bets down, all bets down. Red, odd. I told you that seven was coming up. You're very lucky. Laura. Why, hello, Willi, I haven't seen you in a long time. Can I talk to you one moment? Oh, not now, Willi, I've been having such marvelous luck. So I see. Oh... I didn't win these gambling. Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen. Um, will you please put this on 12, second 12? Laura, I went to see you the next day. I'm sorry I hurt you. It's the last thing in the world I wanted to do. I've got to make amends, Laura. All bets down. Laura, please let me explain. Haven't you explained everything, Willi? That was part of my education. Twenty-four black... You see, you've changed my luck. Why, I've lost practically all the chips I had. - What number are you on, Laura? - Fourteen. You know Lt. Kasder, don't you? How do you do? You've come just in time, darling. I need some more chips. A thousand gulden for the lady, croupier. Are you sure you don't want to play, Willi? No, thanks. Well, good luck. - Hello. - Hello. What's the matter? You look as if you'd lost your last friend. - Maybe I have. - Thanks. Oh, I didn't mean that, Willi. Aha! Your mysterious love affair has gone wrong. If you had come to me for advice, I would have saved your broken heart. - Well, we'll suffer together. - Don't, please, Willi. - I've been to the hospital. - Who is sick? I've been waiting for my... for my son to be born. What? What the devil are you going to do about the girl? Do about her? Why, she's my wife. So you're married. And you have a son. Oh, but you're lucky. Tell me. What is she like? Is she a fine girl? Of course she's a fine girl. Willi, I can't believe it's you taking it all so calmly. Don't mistake me for the emperor. Of course this makes it easier for me to... tell you all about the rest. So there is a rest? You see, things like this cost a lot of money. - How much? - I signed a note. How much, Otto? Two thousand gulden, due tomorrow. Are you sure it isn't two million? I knew it wouldn't be any use. All the use in the world. Tomorrow, easy. You mean it? Really? Willi! You've taken such a load off my mind. Of course, if I had a rich uncle like yours... A rich uncle like mine? Oh, yes, of course. Well, leave it to me. - I can't tell you how grateful I am. - What are you doing here? Go back to that hospital. She'll be anxious. - But, Willi... - Out of here! - She'll be so happy when she hears. - Give her my love. And the little fellow too. Oh, by the way! Don't christen that brat Willi until I've seen him. Say, what's the big idea? Gentlemen, I am in need of money! That was hardly original. On the contrary. This time I need all of everybody's money. - It's for a worthy cause. - Well could you give us any idea of... No, sorry. - Really serious, Willi? - I'm sure this time it is. Well, spend it morally, Willi. It was a present for my uncle, the Archbishop. Step it up, gentlemen, one good jerk and it's over. Fine... I'll count it myself. Now, don't crowd. - Let go! - The line forms on the left. Let go, I have to pay my tailor for these new breeches. - Hey, you fellows... - Your turn, come here! - Hey, come on, let go, Willi! - Ah, ah, breathe naturally. We absolutely guarantee no pain. Hey, don't you take my money away! Hey, don't... Oh-ho! Lt. Junge generously contributes his Sunday breeches. - No change! - Oh, but... Here. Thank you. - Count it out, Willi. - How much did you get? - Count it up. - There you are. Sum collected: 300 gulden. Sum required: 2.000 gulden. How am I going to get the rest? Zero at the cassino pays 36 to 1. You might do it reporting your runs at chemin de fer. That's an idea. The cassino and chemin de fer! At times like these I wish I knew a prayer. Don't worry, you won't need it. - Oh, no! No, no, no! - What's the matter? Thirteen! That's poison! - Oh, my lucky number. - Not mine. - I'd rather wear them. - Go ahead. - Excuse me... - Oh, it's all right, he has a bad cold. Oh, I see we have the army with us tonight. Hello. Any part of 600 gulden. I'll take 300. - Three hundred gulden left. - Willi! Three hundred gulden. - I had my fingers crossed. - Don't be silly, I had my legs crossed. - Six hundred. - Banco. - He shouldn't double like that. - You're disturbing my devotion. Twelve hundred gulden. I take eight hundred. Anybody else? Herr Schnabel's limit is 800 tonight. Banco. Aha, Herr Schnabel is himself again. Kindly deal. Your conversation is not amusing. Pardon me. Teach me that prayer, you fool, before it's too late. - Seven. - Eight. The bank is for sale. Twenty-four hundred gulden. - Two hundred. - Three hundred. - Four hundred. - Four hundred. What's your hurry? My business here is over for the evening. - Croupier. - Thank you. Don't thank me, thank Herr Schnabel. - I'll buy you a drink. - A couple of drinks. A dozen drinks. - A dozen specials. Four for each. - Yes, sir. - Ah, you deserve a big one. - With a cherry in the bottom. I nearly had nervous prostration. How do you come to be so lucky? Oh, it's a little trick I learned when I was a child. Willi. - Hello, Otto. - Hello. - Did you send for me? - Yes. - What for? - Don't I owe you 2.000 gulden? What... what... - Well? - But Willi... - That's wonderful... - Go away! - Oh, but really... - Get out of here! - Oh, but please, Willi, this is wonderful! - Get out of here before I change my mind. Good night. Good night. I didn't know that you owed him any money. Old fellow, there are a lot of things you don't know. Well, to whom shall the first drink be? To Herr Schnabel, he made the drinks possible. By all means. May he get richer every year... and may he lose more to me. Willi. Now, don't give her the opportunity of insulting you again. Ha, if she amuses me, why not? Willi! Very well, I shan't go yet. That will make me amusing to her. On that I shall be a riot. Hello, Willi. You come here much too often. Gambling and drinking, not good for little lieutenants. It's good for little music teachers, though. Waiter, two cognacs. You gave me my first drink. Remember the Wine Garden, when I thought all my dreams had come true? - Wasn't I silly? - Very. You should have known better than trust a mere lieutenant. Now, a fine man like Herr Schnabel, he makes dreams come true. What a shame you're not rich, Willi. You mean, if I had Herr Schnabel's money, would you like me better? With those dashing eyes? Oh, much better. Good. Then I have a remedy. You have a remedy for everything, haven't you? At present, the remedy belongs to Herr Schnabel. But I shall get it from him. You mean you'd gamble for me, Willi? - I'm flattered. - You should be. Here we are. Let's drink to your luck. Bottoms up and no heel taps. And now to baccarat. Oh, I ought to give you a token. You know, how the ladies in the olden days... ...used to give their knights when they wanted them to win. Here, let me tie this on your wrist. But you will need two. After all, you mustn't be partial. - You have two knights. - You're favorite. - At the moment. - I'm honored. Pardon me. Well, the lucky lieutenant again. Maybe it would be kinder if we warned him about my intentions. The lieutenant is going to let you make him rich. Oh, anything the lieutenant is able to win from me he's welcome to. Thank you. A thousand gulden. - Four hundred. - Six hundred. Laura, what do you want most in the world? Don't worry, I'll let you know. - A card? - Yes, please. Nine. Luck seems to go with the lady. The lady seems to go with the luck, you mean. - Eight hundred gulden. - Banco. Very simple this business of getting rich. All you have to do is to tie a handkerchief around your wrist. Card? Nine. Play one thousand gulden. Sorry, but I can't accomodate you. You don't wish to play anymore? Of course I do. But you know what lieutenants could do if his wishes were horses? Oh, but your credit is good with me. My credit is good with you? - Why not? - Fine. Two thousand gulden. I'll take it. Card, please. And now Herr Schnabel, let's see how generous you can be. Just seven. Only eight. Four thousand gulden. Banco. Baccarat. Don't get so enthusiastic. This thing can go on forever. I'm glad you realize that. Eight thousand gulden. Banco! Seven. Eight. Sorry, lieutenant, but that's the extent of your credit. - Fourteen thousand gulden. - Yes, sir. - If you would sign this. - Of course. There's my autograph. Due before noon tomorrow. - Naturally. - Silly, why before noon? Because a gentleman doesn't gamble for more than he can pay promptly. Right you are. Good night, Herr Schnabel. Good night, Fr?ulein Taub. My things, please. Well, Boris, what shall it be? Madame Sacher's or the Blue Palace? - Willi, don't you realize? - Of course I do! What do you want me to do, cry? Besides, if I live to be a general with gout and a bad liver, the whole army would want me to do that. Willi, don't be a fool! Willi. I suppose you've come to tell me how sorry you are to see me lose all that money. - Well, I hope it won't inconvenience you. - It won't inconvenience me in the least. Well, I'm glad. It was really all my fault. Not entirely... Oh! Here comes the luck after the lady. 741, Koenigstrasse. I was just telling the lieutenant how sorry I was to have brought you all the good luck. Can I take you home now, Laura? Yes, please do. Good night, Willi. Good night. Sorry, boys, I've changed my plans. Willi, don't forget what happened to Von Leer. I've changed my plans. Good night. Good night? Yes, I'm tired. Very tired, hm? - Well, I... - All right. You need a good night's sleep. Good night. Good night. You're prompt, Willi. I was afraid you wouldn't come. - You knew I would come. - Well, anyway, here we are. Act 2, scene 1. I'm glad I got here before the play was over. Over? Why, it's just begun to be interesting. You see, I've only lately learned to appreciate your viewpoint. - What do you mean? - About finding love where you like. - Oh, Laura, please. - Oh, I said this was Act 2. And the handsome lieutenant and the little music teacher are way back in Act 1. Who am I now? Well, you're still a lieutenant. And you're still handsome, of course. Or perhaps it's only the little music teacher that's changed. - Perhaps I don't want her to. - Oh, but she isn't serious now. And you mustn't be serious either. Very well, I'm the gay lieutenant. Well then. Enter Laura, greatly changed. Willi. Aren't you going to kiss me, Willi? Good morning. - In the sunlight you're even more... - Oh! I never expect pretty words from a hungry man. - But I'm not hungry. - Nonsense. I remember other breakfasts. So do I. That's what spoils my appetite. Don't be sentimental. Have a strawberry. Laura, darling... I forget the language of lovemaking with the daylight. Don't you like strawberries anymore? Oh... you've got to go and see your dear old rich uncle... ...and get 14.000 gulden and pay off your debts. You haven't much time. You're making believe you don't love me, aren't you? I know better. You do love me. Don't be silly, I'm a businesswoman. Laura, please. I know I'm responsible, but... Yes, Willi. You taught me how to make love without meaning a word that I say. I amused you, and you paid me. Well, you're as handsome as ever. And just as amusing. I return the compliment. You can't find any objection to that. No. You know you've just made a confession, don't you? - A confession? - Yes. You couldn't have cherished this moment of revenge so long... ...if you didn't love me. - Oh, vanity! Vanity, all is... - Far from it. I found out the truth about several things... ...just a little bit too late. Well, I must go and pay my gambling debt. With your rich uncle's money. No. I will pay this myself, like an officer and a gentleman. And by tomorrow you'll forgive me... ...everything. Wait here, will you? Good morning, Uncle. Where have you been? - I've been here twice. - I'm sorry. Well, can you pay that money to Herr Schnabel by 12 o'clock? I'm afraid not. Why didn't you come to me? I don't know... I simply couldn't, that's all. You've done it before many a time. For little or nothing. That's just why. This seems to be my own business. Do you want to die? - Of course not. - No. There. Fourteen thousand gulden. If it had been fifteen, I couldn't have done it. - I don't deserve this. - You're going to. You've made a joke of life and I've laughed and paid for it. That's your luck. Now you're going to marry Emily Kessner as soon as it can be arranged. I can't do that. What kind of an idiot are you? Here's a charming girl, she loves you. You've got your life again, your army career's assured. This isn't a hard thing to do. It's impossible. If you make it a condition, I can't accept it. Thank you. Well, what are you going to do? If you lend me the money, I'll pay my debt honorably. - I'll resign from the army. - Resign? - Yes. - From the army? Resign from the only thing you're fit for? You've had no training for anything else. I want to live as I like. Marry whom I like. If you let me have the money, I'll pay it back to you. Not on your life! - Let you marry some drab old common... - Uncle, please! I love her. Wait till she sees you without your regimentals. Wait till you tell her you're going to work... ...and ask her to share what's coming from that. She'll laugh at you. - I'll take a chance. - Never, do you hear me? Never! - Well? - Duty, sir. You are aware that the colonel has received a certain communication... ...from a civilian of this city. Yes. The colonel expects you to meet this obligation by noon today. It will be met, I assure you. Here, wait, wait, wait. My nephew has contracted no debt that he cannot meet. Take that to Herr Schnabel, confound you, and be quick about it. You young fool! And you've made a fool of me too. - Thank you... - Don't talk! Now, you must keep the fingers arched like this. And always remember that they're little hammers. Pay attention, August. Oh, Herr Colonel. Fr?ulein, your cousin the major. Come in, come in, come in! - I'm glad to see you again. - Thank you. - Good evening. - Good evening. I've looked for you everywhere. Where is your lovely uniform? Oh, um... we are going to a masquerade. I'm going as a human being. Uh... would you please excuse me from the music lesson, because... - It's his birthday. - His birthday? Why, of course, of course, of course. - Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
