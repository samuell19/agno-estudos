What does he know about fixing leaking roof? The thing is, you know, he felt he could fix it himself since what the roof repairer was quoting was too much for us. And if he does it himself, it would save us some extra money. That's why he did that. My sister, how much is the money? My sister, of what use is the church if we can't attend to the need of our faithful members. How much is this money we are talking about? N25,000 sir. Leave that to me.

My dear Bisola, let his get receive sense. Tell her. Open her ears please. Time rolled by. Before I knew it, It was 2 years. And in those two years, I had not sent my aged parents a penny. Not a dime. Ade came up with different stories that he was unlawfully dismissed from work... ...and he needed to pay Lawyers. He needed to pay court fees so that he can get back to work after the case... ...and support the both of us. So that I'll stop extra shift Again. I foolishly believed him. And one day. I received a call... ...that my aged father, my old father... ...he climbed a tree to tap palm wine and he fell down. My father that struggled to raise me. Why? I'm sure he just needed to survive. They had a daughter who was a qualified nurse. I mean I was earning more than enough to take care of them But I couldn't do it. But I'm sure they didn't know. I'm sure they would have thought she was irresponsible Because I didn't tell anyone what I was going through But I was enslaved in this so called abroad marriage. Oh my God May thunder strike him down. He has not even started So I asked Ade. I say please. Please let us send Papa money for treatment. Ade agreed. He agreed. He sent the money. He sent 50 pounds He sent 50 pounds meanwhile I was earning 3,500 after tax. Because I was doing extra shift Papa died. Papa died. Abroad husband every time. Honestly.. After Papa died, I asked my husband, I said please let us bring mama to England So that I can at least take care of her so she won't end up like Papa. But he refused. And for the very first time since we got married, I looked my husband in the face. I spoke to him with a stern voice. I was angry. I was very mad Ade was callous See Ade, just...

There, I got counselling. I am getting there. I am not there yet. I am getting better. But thank God for this coutry that cared so much about the vulnerable like myself and many others. They forbade Ade from getting in touch with me. They retrieved my account from him. This is my eight year away from Ade. And my fourth year after I left the hospital So this thing is common So what you're telling me is that this thing is rampant is tha what you're saying? I didn't know myself until I got in there and I realized that. 70% of black African women in thatsituation were there because of marital issues Our women have been turned into London slaves. So I decided that I was going to be the voice for the voiceless I decided to lend my voice, to tell my story to whoever wanted to listen. I could tell my story ten times a day just to help somebody That we need to speak out, we need to look for help We shouldn't bother about what people are saying. Let's talk about it. Whatever mental slavery they've put them into, they need to get out of it consciously. Oh my God My dear you need to learn from my story. Don't wait for you own experience. It might be too late. God help me. Thank you. Everything will be fine. Alright. Take it easy Alright. Bye ladies Truth is, I don't think I'll be able to bear a child. Ada I am so sorry. I am so sorry. I didn't know it was this bad. I am so sorry. Can you imagine what I have put you into now my friend. No. You didn't know. Moreso, I needed a cute guy from London. You were only doing what a sister will do. But when did my brother become such a monster? Raymond Ali Balogun... And those women said it but we did not believe them Father please help my brother. Please help my brother And the truth is, I don't love him anymore Love died long ago in this marriage. I want a divorce. No Ada. Divorce? Ada it can't happen. You can't divorce my brother. You have to give him another chance. Please. Please. Don't give up on my brother Oh! It's your brother you're concerned about? I am someone's sister! What about me? Don't I matter? You matter Ada. You matter My friend you matter. You know you are more than a friend to me. You are actually my sister. I am so sorry. I am so sorry you had to go through this. I am so sorry. There is nothing I can say I know. But please just one more chance. I am begging you. Please. I am dying. I am dying little by little. Or is it my corpse you want to come and carry? God forbid. It will not happen. But you know what? I have a plan. I know someone. I am going to take you to meet the person tomorrow. And with that, things will work out I promise Just one more thing that you will do for me. Please I beg you in the name of God Please in the name of God. I am so sorry you had to go through this my dear friend. I am so sorry. Good afternoon sir. Is that Raymond Balogun? Yes it is. Oh that's very good. Look I am Inspector Webley. I am telephoning from the police station. We've had a report of domestic violence committed from your address. Would you mind coming into the station for some questions sir? I shouldn't be taking out more than about half an hour of your time Can you come in this evening? Can you be here at the police station this evening sir? You see, the way I am looking at things right now, I think you should sue for a divorce. Yes. Because when you look at it What do you mean sue for a divorce? On what grounds? On the ground of infidelity Yes. Ade Yes Ray. Infidelity. You'll tell them that your religion does not permit a woman to be with a man and still be doing things outside her matrimonial home It could cause you sickenss, it could cause your death As a matter of fact, you should claim abandonment and negligence. Come on man. Are you having a laugh? No I am not. Be serious man. I am serious Ray! I am very serious. They don't reason like the way you and I reason men. If I were you, right now as I speak to you, I will claim bankruptcy. Yes! That way she'll be paying you men. You'll still be minting your dough No! Hell no! I don't want to be a laughing stock. Just say something else. Look. You are not a laughing stock my man. I am telling you as a friend and as a brother. In fact... As I speak to you right now, when we get there, what you should file for is Alimony. And even claim the house on top of it. She will be paying for the house, and also still be paying you. From claiming bankruptcy. Man, wake up! From the look of things, it looks as if This is caused by ancenstral spirits Yes. Ancenstral spirits? Yes. It will require spiritual warefare. But God is mighty. There is nothing impossible with God We have been made more than a conqueror though Christ Jesus. Amen. Oh yes. They have failed in Jesus' name That's it. That's the spirit. With God, it is not hard. But you have to work in agreement with God And to walk with God, You have to take away divorce. It is not an option Because God hates divorce. OK Reverend You see it is caused by people from his father side They have failed in Jesus name. Your husband is the only son is he not? He is Reverend. They do not want him to have a child of his own In fact they want to wipe out the lineage completely. God forbid. So, this ancestral spirit thing, you can drive it away right? Of course. We serve a mighty God. There is nothing Jehovah cannot do, But first of all, you have to work in agreement with God, and then, we would sow a seed. You will sow a seed, the seed of harmony. Seed of harmony. When you sow the seed, it will bring back Harmonious atmosphere in your home. It will restore your home and drive away all the wrong spirits Amen. Reverend, money is not the problem. Money is not the problem at all. as long as my husband will be free. Oh yes. You see a lot of people do not understand the mystery of seed sowing in the kingdom There was a man called Cornelius in the bible, in the book of acts of the apostles This man was a devout Jew. He loved the Lord with his heart and he served God. But Cornelius added to his service of God by giving of alms and offering. Cornelius gave such a "momentus" offering. It became a memorial before God Not only was Cornelius saved, his whole household was saved with him. So thi seed that you're sowing, It will not only deliver your husband But the whole lineage will be saved Oh yes Really! Just seed? Oh yes Reverend please I am ready. How do how do I sow this seed? Not a problem at all. I will... I will pass unto you now the church account details And you can do online transfer Oh yea. Let us pray. Yes Reverend. Let us pray. You're a good friend She is. She is my very good friend. God bless you. [SPEAKING IN TONGUES} What's all these? Baby stop it. I don't want It doesn't matter what you want. I want it now. No stop it. Am I not your husband?
