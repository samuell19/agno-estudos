(Elevator hums) (Over intercom) Dr. Davis -- telephone, please. Dr. Davis -- telephone, please. Dr. Blair -- Dr. Blair. Dr. J. Hamilton. Dr. J Hamilton. (Watch ticks.) Hi, Mr. McMillan, is Natalie ready? I don't think Natalie is ever ready. Come on, man! I've still got to pick up Tommy! Hi, Mr. Taylor. (Knocking) Natalie? (Knocking) Karen's here. Uhh... Just a second, dad. I'll be right down. See ya, Pop. Later. Hey, when are you ever going to get that thing fixed anyway? I've still got to take the pistons out. But, hey. I'm finished grinding the valves. When you ever wanna make enough money to pay someone to do that shit? You know how. Hey, Brad. Man, that's over. (Laughs) Hey, I'm just kidding man! Chill out, will ya? I don't do that stuff anymore Really. Hey. Let's get out of here. Karen... Natalie! Hi! Hi! How are you? It's great to see you. It's good to see you! How've you been? Natalie? Are you finally ready? Yeah. I'm going with Karen. Oh! Are you going with us to the benefit, Karen? Uhh. Well, what do you think? It's about time. Oh, Mom. I love you in that dress. Thank you Natalie. Here, hold on a second though. Let me see something. Come on! We're going to be late. Just a second, dad. There. Thank you Natalie. Are you sure you don't want to wear this? No, I'm positive. It looks perfect on you. You look fine. Let's go! You look gorgeous. You really do Miss McMillan. Thank you girls. See you later. Ok! Natalie! Aren't you going with us to the country club? Oh, I'm sorry, Dad, but Karen and I we're... You're not going? I'm about to make, probably, one of the most important speeches of my career and my own daughter won't be there? We made other plans. Well, where are you going? The Summerfest. The Summerfest? What?! You just got home and already you're looking for Zach. I thought we had an agreement. I promised not to see him. I didn't promise to hide from him. Besides He's probably dating somebody else by now. For your sake... let's hope so. She's already broken up with him. There's no need to go on about it. Well I need to go on about it. I can't understand why you would even associate with a... coke dealer. He is not a coke dealer. I'll never forget what a risk I took pulling strings to keep that boy out of jail. Dad, do we have to go over this again? Excuse me, Mr. McMillan Zach never really dealt coke. He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Not that I meant to butt in. Then don't. (Sighs) Shoulda had a boy... Oh! Valet parking by Brad Deville. You better believe it, man. Hey, what are you looking for? Nothing. He's looking for Natalie. Natalie? So what if I am? Natalie? Yeah... this sounds like a real interesting conversation you guys. but... I'll check you guys out later. I can't believe you, man. How many times do I have to tell you that Natalie McMillan is a rich bitch? The only way you're going to get a girl like that is with money and you ain't got it. So, forget it. (Car door slams) You don't even know the girl. Yeah. Lucky for me. You want to go or not? No. I -- I think I'll just hang out here for a while. Fine. (Chokes) Hehe... He's the driver. Who else? What time? 8 o'clock. Is that all? No. There's one more. Hey. I see him. Where? Right over there. Don't point! Sorry, sorry. What should I do? Should I go over and say hi to him? I would. Natalie! Natalie McMillan, I thought you moved away. Where have you been? College. Where? New York. New York? Why so far away? I made kind of a deal with my dad. Well, it's great to see you. Come on, let's dance! (Mumbles) Oh, hi! I didn't think you'd make it! Oh! Sorry, your foot. It's ok. (Smooch) (Whispered) Yeah! What's her name? Natalie. She reminds me of someone I knew a long time ago. Who? Just someone I used to know. I'm sorry, I've got to go. Hey can I call you sometime Karen! Karen! Damn! We'll have a great time, baby. Where are we going? My house. Struck out? Huh, Tommy? Big time. Hey Zach. Man, I'm really proud of you. Made it through the whole afternoon without asking Natalie to dance. Yeah, I wanted to. Every time I got the nerve up, she disappeared. Too bad it's not for good. Hey, where's Zach? Take a guess. Aww, that idiot! Natalie. Zach! Hi. How you been? Great! When'd you get back in town? Last night. So, what have you been doing? I've been taking night classes at the college. Really?! Yeah. Well, what are you taking? It's a business course. I want own my own business. Restoring old cars? You remembered! What are you doing? Who are you waiting for? Karen. Where is she? She went somewhere with John. I don't know. She just left you here? No, I'm sure she's going to be back... Eventually. Come on man. Let's go. Just a minute. Come on. I hate to leave you here like this. Well, she's gotta come back for her car. Right. Tomorrow, maybe. Not tonight. Come on. Come with us. Are you sure it's ok? Of course I'm sure. Come on. Hi. What's this? Natalie needs a ride. Jeez. Oh Zach. Since you asked me to I told Susie to meet us over at Brad's house. I didn't think you'd be picking up a stray. (Laughs) Fuck off, Candice. Give her a drink. Hey, pass the bottle. You want some? Now you know why it's got a smile on his face. (Laughs) Woo! C'mon... Dude? Natalie, tell me about New York. (Metal intensifies) Don't you like it? I'm s-- I'm sorry. What? Hey Brad! Turn down the music, huh? Sorry man. I can't hear ya. (Laughs) Woo! (Shrieked) Yaaaa-hoo! Dave! I'm gettin' thrown all over the place back here! Fuck, man! (Watch ticks) My lunch is about to do a round trip, dude. Come on, Brad. What's the hurry? What's the hurry?! I'm in no hurry, man. I'm never in a hurry Listen, asshole. Slow down. I mean it. You better slow down! Slow down now! Make me. Come on, Brad. This ain't funny anymore. You son of a bitch you're gonna kill us all! (Screams) (Screaming) Are you ok? Yeah. I'm fine. What the hell happened? I dunno... I think we hit a tree or something. Yeah... And some son of a bitch was standing right in the middle of the road. We crashed? No shit. And if y'all hadn't been yelling so much I probably could have made it. Y'know, we must've gotten thrown clean from the car. Where is the car? Where'd you learn how to drive, Brad? Huh? Hey, why don't you just shut up? You know, this is really weird. None of us even got hurt. Oh shit! What? Candice. (Balloon pops.) Where are the other four? What happened? Displacement. You must track them. And you must abide by the rules of time and space. Quickly... Maybe she's still in the car? Yeah. Wherever the car is at... The car! Hey guys... I've gotta get back to the car before the cops get there. Don't worry about it, Brad, it was an accident. No. No. You don't underst-- Ha! Accident my ass. Look, I've had enough of your shit, Tommy. Well if you didn't try to be frickin' Mario Andretti, man! (Grunted) Get off man! Let go of me, man! Let go! Knock if off, you guys! Come on! You know it's a miracle we're all still alive and you guys are trying to kill each other. Let's find the car. (Sirens) I should've known. Amazing that they weren't all killed. You find any ID? We're gettin' 'em. Tell me something. You see anything about this picture that doesn't fit? What do you mean? I mean that. The door? It was open when we got here. Yeah...? So what do you figure the chances are of a door opening by itself on impact in a head-on collision? Don't take this the wrong way, sarge... But, uh... I think you're reading too much into it. Yeah. Yeah, you're probably right. Let's get out of here. (Sirens) Hey! You forgot us! Come back! You forgot four of the passengers, dumbass! Shut up! What's his problem? Jesus! Aww man! Aww man. Look at it, man. It's mangled. We are lucky to be alive! They're gonna fry my ass. Aww, they're really gonna fry my ass. Candice must've really been messed up man. Oh shit! Hey, what are you doing in my car, man? Hey, wait a minute! You were the dude that was in the middle of the road. You made me wreck my car! What're you still hanging around here for?! You guys, I think we better go. I'm talking to you, jerkoff! Hey, get off him! Man. He's dead man! Get out of here! He's dead! Think we lost one! Aww, come on sweetheart. You know I'd never cheat on you. Why, I'd never even look at another woman. Huh? Well, sure I love you! Jolene?! What's she got to do with this? Hey, call the police! I don't see him. He's out there somewhere. We saw him murder somebody... He's not just going to let us go. That son of a bitch was strong! Hey! We need to use your phone! This guy just killed our friend out there. He's after us! You expect me to believe that? I'm telling you the truth! Aw, get out of here with this crap. I'm not hanging up until I get this little matter settled. What's the matter? This guy... he He won't get off the phone. He's just ignoring me. You know I'm getting sick and tired of your accusations? Do you see that? This guy is a jerk. I'm a man of respect. I deserve respect. Don't you hang up on me, Valerie! Valerie. Valerie! Dammit! Thank you. This guy is an asshole. It's like he doesn't see us. I bet you this guy gets ripped off all the time.

Store alarm goes off. Somebody reports it and we check it out. We get to the scene and there's cash all over the floor. Well, this guy's on all fours picking it up. He says he's just gathering it up to put it back in the register. Well, we search him and... What do we find in his pockets? Cocaine? No. Loose change. A ton of it. He'd taken it out of one of these, uh... kidney fund doohickeys. So I ran him in, and... all the way back to the station he's bellyaching I didn't do it! Poltergeist! Poltergeist! I only have one question... If this clerk robbed the store who set off the alarm? See anything? No. I'm really sorry about what happened to Brad. Yeah, so am I. Well...

Well, I still have feelings for him. How could you have feelings for someone who put your life in danger? Mom I thought you liked, Zach? I don't know what you see in him. What could he possibly give you? You sound just like Dad. Natalie, listen to me. Mom, you're hurting me! I'm sorry, sweetheart. I was just concerned about you. I didn't mean to upset you. It's okay. (Sighs) At the top of the news tonight, a serious car accident leaves two young people critically injured and three dead. We break now for a report. Any official statement, Mayor? Please, I'd rather not comment at this time. Is it true that doctors have informed you to disconnect all life support systems for your daughter? I think it's a personal matter. Just an official comment, Mayor. You want an official comment? The doctors have declared my daughter... brain dead. We have... accepted their recommendation. to disconnect all life support systems. When are you going to pull the the plug? Midnight. Why don't you leave my husband alone? He's made a statement. Please give us our privacy! Mom... (Screams) As you can see, Mayor McMillan is under a great deal of stress this evening. St. Joseph Chief of Staff, Dr. Richard Reiner, has informed the News 10 that with parents' permission, the life support systems for both Natalie McMillan and the other surviving passenger, Zach Taylor, will be disconnected at midnight. Reporting live from St. Joseph's Medical Center, Eric McLendon, News 10. (Screaming) Don't be afraid. I'm not going to hurt you. What do you want from me? Another chance. Stay with me, Natalie. You'll never die! Natalie, get out of here! Get out of here! Get your dad's gun! You're a fool. I have an offer for you, Natalie. I've got an offer for you too. Let him go! I'll let him go... if you come with me. No. Put him down. Put him down or I swear I'll shoot! (Choking) Why don't you try pulling the other trigger? (Boom) You can't kill a man that's already dead. Why don't you leave us alone? Because you belong with me! I belong with him! Zach! (Breaking glass) Zach, are you okay? Oh my god! Thank god, I thought you were dead! Are you okay? I'm fine. Come on. Come on! That's your decision then? To die with him? Dr. Fletcher? Dr. Fletcher? Please report to intensive care. Zach was... really looking forward to seeing Natalie again. Well, he saw her, didn't he? Grant... You don't think much of my boy, do you? I try not to think about him at all. Oh, Grant. Please... I'm sorry. We're all upset over what's happened. Please excuse my husband. He has a tendency to say things he doesn't really mean. I hate buses. Do the buses run this late? Yes, sister. I checked. There'll be one in just a few minutes. The police station isn't that far! Hey. The police can't help us now. Come on. We need to get on this bus. It's supposed to take us to the hospital. Oh my god. We've gotta go back to my house! Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Stop! What are you doing? My mom! He's done something to my mom! Your mom is fine. She's at the hospital. What? When I was at your house, I saw her on the news. She's... She's at the hospital. She's fine. But, she was there. She hugged me! That wasn't your mother. That was that man! How is that possible don't know they don't see us I don't know, but... look! They don't see us. You see that? They don't see us. That clerk didn't see us. I don't understand any of this. What's happened to us? Why don't they see us? Alls I know is, our bodies are at the hospital... and we're here. So, we're dead? Is that what you're saying? No, our bodies are being kept alive with machines at the hospital. So how do we get back to our bodies? I don't know. But, let's get on this bus and it'll take us to the hospital. We can find out when we get there. Come on. (Squealing brake) Thank you. Grant. Oh... Yes, thank you. Dr. Reiner left this for you. I don't know what I'm going to do without Zach. Ever since his mother died... I'm sorry. You don't want to hear about my problems. It's ok, Mr. Taylor. We understand. Hey, sarge. It's been quite a night, hasn't it? It has. The mayor's not going to be happy. First the accident with his daughter and now this. Anything stolen? No, we checked the whole place out it everything seems to be intact. This is crazy! Why would somebody break into a house, shoot a hole in the wall, and then jump out the window? Wait. How do we know what floor our bodies are on? We're just gonna have to check each one. What? They said on the news that at 12 o'clock they're going to cut the machines off. Brrrr-ta brrr-ta ayy mon! said 'ayy mon' I said hey mon! Natalie! Where are you taking me? Seventh floor. There is no seventh floor! There is where I come from. You don't need to be frightened, Natalie. Don't you see? What's happened to you is extraordinary. It's very rare for a soul to be jarred from its human host. Natalie! Natalie! We're here. Where's here? The second level. My world. All you have to do, Natalie, is... say the word. And the door to my world will open to you. What do you mean your world? Who are you?! An angel. An angel?! I take care of souls. I can keep you safe. Like the others in the back? I wanna go back. Don't say that, Natalie. I wanna go back! In your world... only death awaits you. Take me away from here! Very well. Then I'll show you. Natalie! Can you hear me?! You're still looking for her, man? How many times do I have to tell you? Natalie McMillan is out of your league, man. You're still around? I thought for sure you'd be dead by now. Come in. What happened to you, man? I got a new job. I didn't know I was applying for it. I make pickups and deliveries. Oh, don't worry. You're not on my list. You still haven't figured it out. Have you man? Zach... Led Zeppelin was wrong, man. There is no Stairway to Heaven. Even if there was... you couldn't buy your way in. Truth is, I don't even know if there is a heaven. That's all part of it. They keep us in the dark! It sucks. Excuse me. What did you do to her? Nothing, man. She's right here. Brad! Are the papers ready? Mom! Don't let them! By the way, I... ran another EEG. Stop, I'm still alive! Nothing? Don't turn off the machines! No... No... Sorry. I thought for a moment... It's alright. Don't let them do this to me! Please! No, Mom! I want to live! (Cries) You can't go back, Natalie. Goodbye, baby... She can't hear you or see you and if you touched her, you would only frighten her. It's better this way! In the human dimension... people die! They leave you! Stay with me! I'll never leave you! What about Zach? Zach is dead. Come to my world now, Natalie! While there's still time! Come with me! How? How did this happen to you? The accident. I tried to tell him over and over that I didn't mean to hurt anyone but they didn't believe me. I guess it doesn't matter how it happened or whose fault it was. But if you kill someone this is how you have to pay it back. I need your help. Man, you owe me. What do you mean I owe you? The accident! Man, I want to live! I want to get back into my body. You're crazy man. You can't do that. How do you know? You just told me they keep you in the dark. Man, they're really gonna fry my ass. And Natalie. Natalie also. Natalie? Are you sure she's worth it, Zach? Does she really love you? I love her! That's what matters. I don't think I'm going to fry your ass for... for doing a good deed. They'll probably give you a promotion. Take my hand. Where are we? This is a bridge between the human dimension and the world of angels. Connected to a hospital? You're an angel of death! It's my fate, Natalie. Just as it is yours. To cause people to die? We don't cause people to die, Natalie. We merely take their souls when it's time for them to go. I was chosen to take your soul. If I don't... no one will. Do you understand? Come with me, Natalie. All it takes is a kiss... and we can live together forever. A kiss? The pact... between the souls... must be sealed with a kiss. Natalie! Zach! You're alive! Natalie, run! You lied to me! Don't leave me, Natalie! Come on! You'll regret this, son. No, I won't. I think this is the floor you're looking for. Thanks a lot. No problem. Thanks. Hey, remember what I told you. Hit 'em in the heart. Right. Oh... Better bring a couple of these. You might need them. Do you really think this is going to work? Are we going to be able to get back into our bodies? Nah... Hey, hurry up. Ain't got much time. Oh my god. Hurry! How do I do it?! How do I touch?! Just put it in my hand?! Put it in your palm. Put it on your chest. Hurry! Like this?! Like that. Do it! It's not up to us now. Good. Go. God help me! Come on, Natalie! It's all over now. (Screams) It is over now. Is he dead? No. I haven't even disconnected the machines. I was just checking on him. His father left without signing the form. I can still take them! What time do you go on break? It's twelve o three. You abused your order and you violated the balance. You know the penalty for presumption. Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! Hold on now, you've been hurt. Let me go! Calm down. Calm down! Let me go! I need to get to Natalie's room! Let me go! My god, Grant! It's Zach! Here. Let go of me! Come on! Turn on the machines! You're gonna make it. Don't die! Don't die! You can make it. I know you can make it. I can make it right! There is no appeal. If they die now, they'll be lost forever. Come on! Make it, Natalie. I know you can make it. It's a miracle! She's alive! (Knocking) Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt. It's alright, Zach. We've been waiting for you. Waiting for me? We want to thank you for saving Natalie's life. We owe you a great deal. Thank you very much, sir. We'll leave you two alone now. Alright. Thanks dad. Bye, sweetie. Bye. We'll see you back at the house. Alright. Ok. Bye bye. Bye. Surprised? Little bit. I have a surprise for you... Ohhh! But that's not the surprise. Can I look? Not yet. Not yet. Almost. Ok. Now you can look. Oh! What do you think? Oh, Zach! Oh god! I worked overtime so it'd be ready before you got out. It's beautiful! You're beautiful. Come on. It's so perfect. I feel like we've been given... a second chance. Well, we have. But, whatif he comes back? Maybe we'll meet again in Paradise. Let's go.
