You are saying that your AI system can basically direct the way that I should think? In theory, yes. Then I don't like it. Excuse me. So, little sis. Did you keep up with your martial arts? No, not really. Aw. Too bad. I did. I'm damn good now. Wow, I'm so jealous. What's that about you, Silver Hawk, and the lamppost? Hmm? It's not true, right? I want your real telephone number. No more tricks. My invention is... is purely for the benefit of mankind. What's wrong with that? There's nothing wrong with your invention. They still don't understand about interactive artificial intelligence. Cheer up, boss. I'll make you a cup of coffee. Stop. Who are you? They've got the professor. Over here. Hurry up! Stay put. Let's go! Follow me. Come on. That way. Check 'em out. Let's move. Let's move. Go, go, go. Attention all units, this is Superintendent Man. Professor Ho has been kidnapped. Keep a lookout for a black armored vehicle. Mimi, got that? Quickly turn on the satellite tracking system. You got it. They're eastbound on Science Museum Road. No, no, they changed directions. They're now heading westbound, turning into Mandarin Road. Whoa! Whoa! Woo-hoo. Yes. That's my idol. Don't worry. Don't worry. She'll save the professor. Get off me. What am I, chopped liver? Sit back. Take care of them. Crash! Hey, hey. Yo, yo, yo. Did you see Silver Hawk? She is so femme fatale. Did you see her bike and how she jumped off and delivered that spinning kick? 360-degree somersault and came back with a back... Hey, hey, hey, kid. You're only here to help with the investigation, not slam me. Hmm? Professor Ho has no money, no friends. The only thing of value is in his head. So who would find him interesting? To Shiraishi Enterprise from sender. Who's this? The Shiraishi Organization was one of the initial sponsors of the development of Professor Ho's chip. They wanted to have the exclusive rights to the AI system. My boss refused. The last e-mail was sent a week ago. Shiraishi is one of the biggest financial powerhouses in Zenda. Telecommunications, media, electronics... You name it. I really don't think they'd resort to kidnapping my boss. Anything is possible. I'm going to Zenda. What? I'm coming with you. What for? I can help you. I know my boss will find a way to contact me. Oh, yeah? Really. Trust me. Bye. I'm not lying. Stupid front kick, back kick, side kick. I could use a bit of imagination, you know. Imagine it. Shut up, liar. Come on. Give me a chance. Okay, okay. Next time when I really see, I'll tell you, okay? Next time, next... shut up. Get out of here. Leave me alone. So I'm going, right? Let me introduce myself. I am Alexander Wolfe, the one man who truly understands your work. I believe your AI invention has greater potential than even you can imagine. Look at the world today. It's run by fools, fools whose singular objective is to be elected by an even bigger bunch of fools. And they call that democracy. People need leadership, clarity. They simply need to be told what is best for them. Don't you agree? Now, with your new chip and my vision, we will be able to bring the minds of the people together under one common voice. My voice. Wh-what do you want from me? To bring your prototype AI chip into mass production and install it into this phone. You want to use my invention to dominate people's minds? No. No way. The whole idea of my microchip is to improve the lives of the people, not to turn them into... Into your slaves. You're insane. I'm not going to... Do you really think you have a choice? Crash! Shiraishi Enterprise brings you the latest in communication technology, the SZ8000. This blue-tooth phone keeps you in touch, face to face with your friends around the world via the wristband communicator. I am Lieutenant Lisa Hayashi, and we are here to see Mr. Shiraishi. Yes, please wait. Thank you. If they have Professor Ho's AI chip, which they don't, they could make the voice and data interactive. With greater intelligence, it could even be totally voice-activated. Hmm, kind of like you? What are you doing? Me and the professor have a very special way of communicating. I'm trying to look for him right now. Oh, yeah? Good luck. Thank you. Lieutenant Hayashi? My apologies. Mr. Shiraishi is with a very important guest. He has no time to see anyone today. Who could be so important? Hey, Lulu Wong. I almost forgot. Auntie sends her best regards. Oh, thank you. Little Sis? Lulu, what are you doing here? Oh, let me introduce. This is my uncle, Mr. Shiraishi. Oh, I'm Superintendent Man, from Polaris City. Hi, nice to meet you. Lieutenant Lisa Hayashi, Zenda Police Department. Nice to meet you. Hi, I'm Kit. Oh, sorry. Hi, Tina. Hi, Daddy. I'm downstairs. Can we have lunch together? I'm busy. But Lulu. Hey, Tina. Lulu, it's been a long time. I miss you so much. Me too. Daddy, can I have lunch with Lulu? Could you, Lulu? Of course, I'd love to. I'll be right down. I'll leave you to your business. I'll see you all later. Okay. Mr. Shiraishi, we understand that the Shiraishi Enterprise has great interest in Professor Ho's invention. My company is very interested in including Professor Ho's new chip, but I don't think we need to resort to kidnapping. Mr. Shiraishi, may I ask you... Let me help you make an appointment. Please. Tina. Let go of me. Help me. Interesting. They're the ones who kidnapped the professor. Huh? Hey. Stay back. Or I'll kill her right now. Shiraishi told my department not to interfere. I don't think he's going to cooperate with us. Tina and Professor Ho were kidnapped by the same people. What's the link? Lieutenant, we started surveillance. We have already been answering so many questions. Any news? Any ransom demands? Well? Tell me. What's happening? Little Sis. Ow, what? I thought you said you hadn't been training. I see you still have all the moves. Not really. Hmm? Yes. So how well do you know Shiraishi? Very well. Since the day I was adopted. Uncle and my dad were best of friends. Is he very influential in Zenda? What do you mean? Well, he's asked the police not to interfere with his case anymore. So we're on our own. If he has chosen to cooperate with the kidnappers, we'll just have to wait and see what he's up to. So, Little Sis... Hmm? Do you still have the mask that I made you? Sorry. I lost it a long time ago. So why did you become a cop? Don't you remember? I was always the defender of justice. Now I'm legit. I do it with a badge. Honestly, I thought that you would have become a cop. I thought about it. But you know me. I like to do things my own way. I see. So you're here in Zenda for... Uncle Akira. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Hey. Damn it. You okay? Where's my daughter? How much money do you want? I don't want your money. I want your cooperation. My SZ8000. This is the new SZ9000. Your 8000 is obsolete.

This is it! Professor Ho, how are we getting along? Everything is running smoothly. Wonderful. These are the first of the subliminal messages that I want you to transmit for me. How long will it take for them to be effective? To completely dominate a person's mind, the process will take four to six weeks. No, no. That's too long. You have ten days. That'll seriously affect the reticular formation area and cause long-term brain damage. And? Do it. What are you doing? Speeding up the process like what you told me. Check and authenticate what is that. It's clear, sir. Don't get any ideas. The SZ9000 sets a new paradigm for man-machine interface and total synchronization of artificial and human intelligence. Combining all the functions offered by the SZ8000, this new device incorporates state-of-the-art AI and interactive technologies.

By the way, your cholesterol level is now at 215. It's a bit on the high side. May I make a booking at Kenyo House? How about 8:00 at Kenyo? I'm looking forward to seeing you there. It's force activated. That's the professor's idea. Looks like the professor's concepts are all here. That's strange. Yeah. You're right for once. Excuse me. Miss Wong? I'm sorry, but Mr. Shiraishi said he is not receiving any guests today. What? Not even Lulu? But it's very urgent. Can you try again, please? Not enough publicity. I don't care how much it costs. Have the phones gone out? Yes, sir. Every senator received a phone yesterday. Uncle Akira. Is everything all right? Who was the man in the helicopter? Is he the kidnapper? Get rid of her now. Uncle? Are you okay? Oh, by the way, our chip was delivered to your plant today. Production of the SZ9000 will start immediately. Understood? Get them out of here! I've never seen Uncle Akira like that before. Hey, look. His daughter is kidnapped. And yet he is so enthusiastic about his promotion. I don't get it. Yes. Yes, sir. The suspect has appeared. Just give me some time. Just get there before Silver Hawk. Yeah. Hi. I need to talk to you. Sure. Wait for me at the bar. Let me change first. Huh? Oh, you're going somewhere.

Wolfe is using his chip to dominate the minds of the users of the SZ9000. He will begin the uplink of his mind-domination messages through this satellite on the second of this month at 3:00 p.m. After that, all of the users of the phones will be affected. We need to stop him. That's today. Hey, did he say when the transmission would take place? No, but I should be able to track it down in a few hours. A few hours? We don't have the time. Lisa, you need to send a search team out there. To where? To... To... huh? Number 9 Country Road, compliments of Silver Hawk. That's it. Lisa, it's our last chance. Trust me. Okay. I'll get my team.
