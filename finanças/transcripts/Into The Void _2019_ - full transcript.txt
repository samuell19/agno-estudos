Something different about this place. I don't know, we never come here anymore. That's 'cause you never wanna leave the house. Coming here was my idea. I miss our moonlit walks through these trails. Just the two of us and the silence, counting the stars. Look, why are we here? Do you wanna walk or what? You never wanna talk. What's there to talk about? I'm struggling. Right, okay. Well, it hasn't been easy for me either, okay? You just need to move on. I'm trying. I don't think you're trying hard enough. Hey, you've gotta get up off your ass. I wanna break up. I'll move in with my mother. Oh yeah, 'cause she's always been good for you. Maria, I know I'm not perfect, but you and I both know that you have to stay. I can try and change some things. I wanna believe you'll change, but if you really want what's best for me you'll either come with me to the city or you'll let me go. That's not fair to me. Why should I have to uproot myself? We're not gonna grow as individuals, as a couple, by staying in our current situation. It shouldn't have to be this difficult. I just want a normal life. Be with someone who loves me. Have our own home, have a family, a career, be happy. We almost had that. Are you sure we're going the right way? Of course, it hasn't been that long. What are you doing? I'm just feeling restricted! What do you mean? Just so many disjointed thoughts flooding through my mind. Maybe you should sit. I'll be fine. Come on. You're probably just dehydrated. I'm not. Why are you trying to convince me there's something wrong with me? I don't know, you're just not yourself. I don't know what it is, I just... I feel like I'm losing myself. Okay, hey, hey, hey. Maria, just breathe. Okay, you'll be all right, we'll get you looked at. I'm sure it's nothing. You're dismissing me. You always do this. I was never good enough. I hate who I am. Why are you talking like this? Why didn't you love me? Why? You treated me terribly, you hurt me! Maria, stop this. Why, Josh, why? I hate you! Why are you acting like this? You aren't yourself. We're leaving now. Stop doing this! I am trying to help you. I don't believe you. Maria, please. I can't trust you. Why are you saying this? You're scaring me. I know what you're doing. You're trying to take me away so he can hurt me. So who can hurt you? What are you talking about? Don't take me. I need to take you to a doctor. Fuck you! Maria. He's here. Who is here? You led him to take me away, he'll hurt me. No, I will protect you, look. He's here now. Look at me, look. Nobody's here. You're safe with me, okay? I will get you out of here. How can I trust you, I don't even know who you are? What are you talking about? You know me. Why you here, what you want with me? Why are you talking like that? - Who you are? - What? It's me. What do you mean who am I? I'm your goddamn boyfriend. - Boyfriend? - Yes. - You're lying. - No, it's me, Josh. We live together. Why do you not remember this? Remember. Yes, hey. Don't know you. Maria! Somebody help. Somebody. A state of emergency. The population is in hysteria as a staggering number of people are inexplicably losing mental and physical capability. An unprecedented pandemic is sweeping our city, people suddenly becoming delirious and viciously attacking others, spreading the disease. Reports from other cities keep streaming in reporting identical crises. My baby, she doesn't recognize me, why? What are we dealing with here? A lethal viral outbreak? People are demanding an explanation, the government yet withholding answers. Is this environmental, biochemical? The rate of deterioration has been a matter of minutes to a few days depending on the victim, yet each case appears to follow a similar sequence of loss of functions. We've lost contact with our sister station. Communication lines are going down everywhere. Major power grids are going down. With the population dropping, there simply isn't the manpower to keep up the infrastructure. How widespread is this thing? Do we know how far it affected the outside world? It's been a week and spontaneous outbreak has seemingly stopped. The only new known cases of infection are from attacks. Has our immune system adapted or is the virus weakening? Continue to refrain from contact with the sick. They appear benign, but their aggression flares up at sundown. For now, we co-exist in their world. Band with fellow survivors and wait this out. We can beat this. If anyone can hear this, we are a small community of survivors. Over 90% of our village was infected. By day, the Invalids keep to the shorelines in a harmless trance. But at sundown, they grow violent and breach our borders with bloodthirsty attacks. Through vigilance and solidarity to a strict set of rules, we continue to subsist. We have sworn not to leave the village, the risk is too great. And we have not had contact with anyone outside since the event. If there are other survivors out there, if you can here us, please respond. Why do they gather near the water? It's like they're looking for something. Did you ever feel guilty? That it wasn't us? No. That's just dad's guilt resurfacing. I just feel bad you were stuck with me. Haven given the choice, you're the first person I would have chosen. All I mean is that you deserve better. Me, I deserve this fate. Dad's guilt again. That's probably what did him in, not the Alzheimer's. We can't be an exception. If our town could produce 48 survivors, then there have to be others like us out there. That's her. I know you wanted to see her. It's hard to see her like that. You're not the only one going through this, you know? Use your head and don't be selfish, you could put the community at risk. Andrew. Shut up. I'm not gonna do anything stupid, okay? Sorry, my boys, you're too late. I'm closing up shop. Bullshit, old man. It's not even four. We ran out of food. Maybe he's hogging it for himself. Yeah, you seem to be putting on some weight there, Mark. No one's getting fat in these conditions. We're getting mighty thin on rations, boys. We caught some fish today. Thank God that there's still some left. Ms. Margot, she was attacked Wednesday night. - Did she make it? - Sadly, no. That's why we have to be vigilant. Fuck. The Invalids are getting more aggressive and determined. We think it has to do with the rising temperatures. Refrain from contact, stay within the borders, lockdown at six o'clock. Ms. Margot now? Are you okay, Josh? Yeah. Things are getting worse, aren't they? We're smarter than them. Yeah, but how many more people are we gonna lose? We're not gonna lose any if we stick to the regulations. What good are regulations if we don't know what the fuck we're up against? What do you know about survival? You can't even take care of yourself. We found Maria. So that's what this is about. I know what you're going through. We've all lost someone. But we've gotta stick together if we wanna survive. We don't have all the answers. You're not gonna find them out there, I can tell you. You don't know that, Mark. Well, let's talk about what we do now. James Merrilwood's daughter, she hikes into the city and isn't heard from in two weeks. Then the event happens and he goes looking for her. He doesn't return. So what do you think happened? No one has come back. No one is looking for us. We're alone. If we wanna survive, we have to support the one sure thing we've got: each other. I owe you one. Thanks for taking me away from my boring ass work colleagues. You're welcome. You looked like you were having so much fun. Oh, you're so much more interesting. Do you try those cheap magic tricks on every girl that walks in the bar? Only those that are easily entertained. You know, I don't normally go home with guys I've just met. Of course not. Can we just slow it down? Yeah. I really like you. Yeah. I really like you too. That's why I wanna, you know. Yeah. I just haven't in a while, and the last guy kinda hurt me, so yeah. Why are you here? You're genuine. I guess I just have a good feeling about you. Why, because I bought you a drink? I mean, face it. You're gonna go home in the morning back to the city and we'll probably never see each other again. That's not true. All right, well, we don't have to stay here. Do you like stars? Maria. Maria, I miss you. Not moving, not moving. Maria, hey. Hey, it's me, Josh. Something's wrong, not moving. Maria, what's not moving? Hey, what's not moving, you? Huh? Hey. Do you need to find home? Home? Yeah, home, that's right. Home's that way. Maria. I wish I could be with you. I wish I could help. Hey, here. Hey, hey, hey, hey. I don't wanna lose you again, okay? I need to go. Stay here. Stay here. I'll see you again, okay? I promise. Where the hell were you? I lost track of time. You couldn't see the fading light? I'm fine. - You didn't get attacked, did you? - No. Shit, you scared me. You went to see her, didn't you? Answer me! Yeah, I did. There's no point, Josh. The Maria we know is gone. She's not. They're vegetables. She knew me, Andrew. What, you talked to her? You're gonna get us all fucking infected. Will you shut the fuck up? I'm fine. Please, Josh, you're hurting yourself. How am I hurting myself? I know how much she meant to you, and I'm sorry she's gone. But we all have to find a way to move forward now. Move forward? We live in that pitiful community, okay? They're in the Dark Ages, Andrew. There's no alternative. And I don't wanna get ejected from the community because of your selfishness. It ensures our survival, Josh. Well, maybe I don't wanna just survive. Well, I do. I don't know what you're talking about. Hey, don't fucking lie to us. What I do is none of your fucking business. It is when you risk this community. We were very clear about the regulations. Yeah, well, they're your rules, not mine. They were approved by the community. They've been protecting us, that's why we're surviving. You call this survival? We are running out of food, okay? The attacks are worsening. And we're cut off from the outside world. On top of that, you've separated me from Maria. She's out there, she's helpless. I'm sorry for you, Josh. I know your pain, we all do. So why don't you let me do something about it? Not at the risk of the community. What about that don't you understand? I'm trying to help you here. Yeah, you're just like my old man was. I'm not your enemy. You need to do this for these people. Or what? Or we'll do it for you. You're gonna kick me out? Consider it your last warning. - Go fuck yourself! - Hey, stop! Settle the fuck down! Fuck you. Are you gonna hit me like you hit your father? He deserved it and so do you. If you think that way, then you can leave. You don't need to tell me twice. No, Josh. Then so be it. You're not part of this community. He doesn't mean it. I do mean it. These people don't know what's good for us. You won't make it out there. You don't know that, and neither do they. They just want you to believe in that bullshit. You can find out for yourself. Don't come back, Josh. You've made your decision. What makes you think you can help Maria? I saw her. She's still in there. There is no cure. You'll have the same demise, and I'm gonna lose you. You don't need me. You remembered our spot. You know, the stars only come out at night. Why are you wandering? Hey, hey, I can help you. Hey. Slow down. Slow down, yeah, sure. Sure, yeah, we'll slow right down. Okay, so you remember our first night? What else do you remember? Do you know who I am? You're Maria, I'm Josh. Do you remember us? We live together. Home? Home, that's right, we live in a home together. I'm your boyfriend. I'm Josh. Josh? Josh, that's right. Go home? Yeah, Maria and Josh will go home together. But first we gotta get you help, okay? We gotta go to the city. Go home. We will, I promise. We gotta get you something to eat first, okay? Hey. Hey. So, insects, bugs, and bark aren't a balanced diet, okay? Shit. Okay, you need to eat something, okay? You're malnourished. Here you go. You're thin, you're malnourished. Maria, you need to swallow. Maria, I'm trying to help you. Hey. Maria, you smell like shit. I'll get you into some clean clothes, okay? Here. You don't even look sick.

Maria, where are you going? Hey. Hey, where are you going? Go home. Home, yeah, what does that word mean to you? - Go home. - Hey. Hey, home isn't that way. Hey. Hey. Hey, we can't go that way, okay? We gotta get to the city, we need to get you help, all right? See those mountains back there? Look. Yeah, that's where we need to go, okay? That's where the city is. Hey, hey. Hey, you need to stop this, okay? You need to stop, all right? Maria. Maria, where you going? Can't believe I'm listening to you. That is where we should be going. Yeah, well, what the fuck do I know. You know, in a couple hours, you and your friends will be trying to devour me. Maybe that's your cunning plan. Maybe you're smarter than you let on. You listening to me, at all? No, of course not. Fuck me, right? Oh what now? Oh fucking goddam it. Maria, I have to believe you have greater cognition than we know. And I know you're looking for answers. I'm sorry that this happened to you. I can help you find those answers, you know. Maria, we're way of course, okay? I can't even see the mountains anymore. I mean, we're getting further off course the more we go. Hey. You need to stop, okay? You need to listen to me, you don't know what's right for us. If we keep going, it's going to be nightfall soon, and we're going to get in a lot of trouble. Go ahead. I'm so lucky to have you. You could have done better though. No. I wish you could see what I see in you. A failing liver? No, smartass. A big heart, and someone I can trust. There's something I have to tell you. I'm pregnant. Honest? Honest. Don't be scared, this is a good thing. Josh. I wanna have this child with you. You have no idea where you're going, do you? Of course not. And I'm an idiot for following you. You cold? I feel sorry. Sorry? He was a liability. - Get down. If your foot gets gangrene, you cut it off before it spreads. He wasn't slowing us down. He didn't have to give away our resources. We abandoned him and we took all of his remaining possessions. We leave behind weak bitches. Hey, hey, hey. Shut up. I heard something. - Whatever, it's not even sundown yet... - I said shut the hell up. - What did you hear? - Stay, hey, stay. Silent, okay? It's just a retard playing with himself in the bushes. Hey, another Invalid. Let's play a little game with these two freaks. Yeah, let's fuck em up. Hey, show some respect. Let's see what happens if I shoot off her kneecap. No! Are you fucking with me? No, I'm not trying to fuck with you guys. Why are you pretending to be one of them? I didn't know if I could trust you. Well, that depends. Are you trying to take something from us? - No. No, no, no, we're just trying to get to the city. We? They don't want her there. Is she your wife? My partner. Do you still love her? I do. Oh god. I'm sorry, but she doesn't love you back. A shell of a human is all they are. You have to stop caring, she's gone. There's nothing left of the woman you loved. But is there a cure? We're trying to get to the city. I've been in quarantine since the event, I don't know what's out there. You don't wanna go to the city. They're under martial law. They're forcing their idea of order. You'll have no individual freedom. But can they help her? If the New Order doesn't have your best interest in mind, why would they have hers? No, your best chance of survival is out here, making your own life. But you cannot let her hold you back. Weakness has no place in survival. I have to try. It's sad. You're selfish. I have to try to help her. Of course you do. Now pick up your bag and give it to me. What? The bag you left in the bushes. Pick it up and give it me. We're taking it. We don't need his garbage. It's nothing personal. It's just natural law. He can go and sacrifice himself to the collective of the New Order, but we've chosen to look after ourselves. No one else will. Now, the bag. Fuck you. I wanna help you. You need to stop being selfish and let her go. She's not the woman you fell in love with. She's hurting. You need to relieve her of that pain. You need to end your own suffering. This is pointless. Do it! Pull the trigger! You can move on. Oh. Hey, hey! Get up. Get up. Get the fuck off me. Oh fuck. Stop! Don't pick up that gun. What the hell are you doing? You could have avoided this. I'm not your enemy. Neither is he. Neither is she. Do what you want with her. We're taking your bag. Good luck getting to the city. Don't let us see you again. Hey, don't leave me! Ah. Ah! Come on, help me. Help me. Go home? Yeah, I'm trying. Where were you? I was out. With Kevin and Don. You don't even like Kevin. He's tolerable. More tolerable than a pregnant me, apparently. You know, Kevin doesn't let me give him foot massages, so you've got that on him. So that's why you had to come home? Pretty much. This can't keep happening. I need you to come home after work. I'm doing my part. I'm taking care of you, aren't I? Hardly. You're out and about doing your own thing like I don't even exist. Well, how about you stop trying to control my life? I'm not trying to control your life, but you just seem fucking oblivious to my needs. I need you to be home with me while I'm carrying your child. Yeah. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry. Like that's gonna get you off the hook. It might. Don't count on it. I mean. You know I think you're sexy like this. Yeah, right, I feel like a fucking beached whale. Hey, you know, you should know where the path is. You've been in these woods long enough. Stop it. Okay, okay, go ahead. No, God. Maria, don't eat that. Come on. Okay. Cut it out! Maria, I don't have, okay, I don't have time for this. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Come on. There. Thanks. Don't leave. I won't. Come on. Have you seen my keys? Drinking already? No. I can smell it on you. It's not even noon. And you haven't gotten out of bed yet. I don't have the energy. That's because you're miserable. I wonder why. Yeah, put the blame on me. Why don't you take responsibility for your emotions? I am. I'm trying to fix this relationship. What about you? What are you doing to take responsibility? For what? For your life, for us? There's nothing wrong with my life. That's what the problem is, you don't see a problem. Okay, so, how would you like me to change? I want you to be a better man. Oh, okay, okay, a better man. Stop coasting through life, stop barely getting by. I'm doing fine. You blame others for not getting anywhere, but why didn't you take that promotion? There were better men for the job. No, there weren't. Stop drinking your life away being cynical about everything and everyone around you. Don't try and tell me how to live my life. I am happy the way I am. You are bitter and complacent. Don't tell me how to live my life. Then stop being fucking selfish, stop only thinking about yourself. Don't fucking try and change me. Hey. Don't wanna go. Yeah, let's not do this again, okay? Coming, coming. Who's coming? Oh, Maria. Stop fighting me. I'm not your enemy. Stop it, I'm trying to help you. You need help. You got us lost, do you understand? Maria, we have no food, we have no compass. We are lost and the sun is going down. Josh. Josh. Josh, something's wrong. Josh, quick, help me. Josh. Come on. Josh. Maria. Josh. I'm coming. Oh fuck. Oh. Maria? Fuck. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! I'm coming. Oh God. Josh, quick, help. Josh, quick, help. God. Oh God. She's not moving. Hey, hey, it's okay. Our baby. What can I do? Tell me what to do, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do, tell me. - Oh God. Fuck. Fuck. Who are you? I'm a survivor, like you. Ah-ha. And what are you doing here? I suppose the same as you, searching for hope. Ah-ha. Do you know where the city is? Of course, I live there. Why are you out here? I know you feel like nature rejected humankind. The truth is we rejected it first. I come out here to reconnect with it. I've seen it bring out the worst in people. Survivors stealing from their neighbors. A wealthy family slaughtered. A woman gang-raped. Just beyond the river, I found a girl held captive in a kennel. Another was tied to a pole. I heard a scream from within too. You see an old cedar shack, you stay away. You said there was a kennel too? You've seen it? Yeah, I've heard of it. We'd best be getting you to the city. That's us here. It's northwest to the city. Let's go. It was our anniversary today. Right. One year since you took me stargazing. How could you forget? Just 'cause I don't remember the dates doesn't make it any less special. Why don't we do anything special nowadays? I don't know. Life gets in the way. Only when we let it. Come here. Why can't we go back to those days? We can start over. Yeah, but we don't need to start over. We'll make it work. You're making it work? I don't see it. You're better than this. A year ago, I met a man who refused to have a one-night stand with me, who wouldn't let me return to the city. You fought for me then. Just beyond the river, I found a girl held captive in a kennel. Hello? Is someone there? Help! Help! Is someone there? Hello? Is someone there? Help, help! Thank god. Please, get me out of here. You're the Merrilwood girl that went missing, right? Yeah. I was kidnapped. I hitchhiked a ride on the highway. He was nice at first. He touched me and played with my hair. He said he was going to the city too, but he needed to go to his place first to grab something. He took me here. You're the only one here. There were others. He did terrible things to us. I know. I know, Maria was here. Who's Maria? She's my partner, she came back. Why would she come back? I don't know. She's sick. She's one of them? What happened to them? - I don't know. All I know is that we can't leave here. Fuck, they're gonna be aggressive soon. - We can't stay here. The sun's going down, so it's too late to leave. But he'll find us. Okay, well, we don't have an option, okay? We'll stay the night and we'll leave in the morning. But he comes home before sundown every night, he'll be here any minute. You'll be eaten alive out there. Oh fuck you. Let me go. I'm not here for you. Why are you here? I'm looking for my girl. Is she here? She was. Maria. Why did you take her? They come to me. It's random, indiscriminate. Why did you hurt her? Hurt her? Is that what she said? You violated her, you sick fuck! Your moral pronouncements are a cheap attempt to understand things that you don't. You're gonna rot in hell, you son of a bitch, you pig fuck. Hell? Hell is out there. Have the sick been judged? What do you want with me anyway? Nothing. You came to me. I just need to rectify your intrusion. Rectify? Stay the fuck away from me. You will choose the degree of your suffering. What have you done with Sarah? Oh fuck you. The highway's a half mile this way. Move, go. Watch out! Stop. I can't let you do that. Go, go, go. Go, go, go, I got him. Maria, look at you. How is this possible? They found a cure. Oh my god, you're hurting, Maria. Maria. Maria, stop, stop this. Maria! We made it. Yeah. Thank you. You sure you don't wanna come to the city with me? I have to know if they survived. Hope is all we have. Follow the highway, take exit 13, camp in town. Take the connector, cross the bridge. You'll get home. I hope you find her. Good luck. You don't wanna go to the city. They're forcing their idea of order. If the New Order doesn't have your best interest in mind, why would they have hers? Again and again, this can't keep happening. We need to gate the windows, set the tripwire. There has to be some fucking consequences. We'll teach these bandits. It's about time these sons of bitches pay. I've run out of patience. If they don't wanna follow the law, we'll force them into submission. What was that? Where you gonna go now? You think you're tough, huh? Making your own rules. You think you're gonna rob us again? Rob you? No. Then what are you doing sneaking around? Look, I'm just looking for help. Help? You don't know? The state of emergency is over. We've established order, it's safe here. What kind of help do you need? It's my partner. She's sick. We treat the sick. Where is she? Their actions are usually pretty predictable, following simple patterns. Go home. Yeah, she was withdrawn at first. Then she got angry. Then she got compliant as we progressed. Digressed. Those are the emotions with which she related to me as a young adult, a teenager, and a child, respectively. So much hurt and resentment after what happened to her. So she traced her memories back. Maybe she's tracing history to find her way home. They're forcing their idea of order. Oh my god. Josh. You survived. Is she here? Have you seen Maria? Why wouldn't you know where she is? Why isn't she with you? Sylvia, she's sick. I was with her, but she left me. My poor baby. Josh, you were supposed to be taking care of her. Sylvia, I tried. Why didn't you come sooner? I was worried sick. I was trapped in the village. I saw her on the outskirts. I left to try to help her, direct her to the city. She's got a mind of her own. They're still intelligent. Who are they? She's still here? Sylvia, is she here? - Josh. - Where is she? Where is she? She's tired, let her rest. She's in the bedroom. You lied to me? You couldn't take care of her. I brought her here. She came here on her own. She didn't need you. Oh, like she's ever needed you? She was searching for me, Josh. The moment she arrived, she collapsed in my arms. No fucking shit she did. That's all she ever wanted from you, just some semblance of tiny fucking piece of love. I never stopped loving her. I know I made mistakes. I wasn't a good mother. But the past doesn't matter anymore. It's how we help her now. So what are you gonna do? Are they here to cure her? They're here to help her. We'll take away her pain. Oh yeah, you're gonna make her all healthy again, right? Josh, it's not that simple. Then why are they here? We treat them the only way we can. It'll make it easier for her. Oh yeah? What are you gonna do, kill her slowly? No. Josh, please understand. She's dying. She's in a lot of pain right now, and it's only going to worsen. We'll inject her, take her to the facility, and keep her on the serum. The neuro-degeneration will be hastened, but at least it will be manageable. So you're gonna euthanize her. It's palliative care, Josh. It's what she needs. It is hastening her death. We're doing what's right for her. We can't think selfishly. Selfish? You of all people wanna talk about selfishness? You have always, always been selfish with her. And what about you, Josh? What were you hoping for when you dragged her to the city? A return to what things used to be? This isn't about you. This is about what's right for Maria. I wish it could be different too. It isn't easy for me to make this choice for my daughter. And it's not easy for me to see her in pain. How long? They can still live weeks, even months. So I'll visit her. It's a quarantine. She doesn't want this. She doesn't wanna be isolated, locked away. She still has feelings, okay? She came here for us. Sylvia, she needs us. We need to act soon. Sundown is coming. Can I see her before you go in? I'm sorry I wasn't there for you. I'm sorry I couldn't help you. I'm sorry I didn't listen to you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I couldn't understand you. You're my best friend.
