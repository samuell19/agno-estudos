See you guys later! Have fun at the game. You're not going to the game? No, What? don't think so. I'm not that feeling good. Really? Are you sure. Yeah, I'm sure. But everybody's going. You'll be home all alone. Honestly, that sounds pretty nice especially being in a house full of girls all the time. Come on, Alex, you don't have many games left in your college career. Why don't you just take a tonne of pictures and What? will just live vicariously through you? Hmm, why don't you get dressed in something cute and we'll live vicariously together? It's not going to happen. But What? love you. What? love you. We'll miss you. Bye! Hey, babe. So, game totally sucked. Everybody decided to come over. We're going to hang. Want to come play? Yeah. Yeah, sure. What? You OK? Well, What? had one of my bad dreams again. Yeah, and... OK, ah, we've got some wine downstairs. Come on. Great. Yeah. OK. Chill out, little weirdo. It's OK. Good morning. What? need help. Say it. Say that you'll marry me. Just say it. No! Quit grovelling. I'm not grovelling. I'm begging. Babe, What? just... I can't. Why not? Because. I'm an independent woman, OK? What? don't want you to be my crutch. What does that mean? It means What? know myself. All right? And... I'll get complacent. I'll lose my edge. You're not going to lose your edge. No, I'm a struggling artist. And if we get married, I'm just going to get comfortable. Plus, What? need a little spontaneity in my life. You can be spontaneous, darling. I'm serious. Look, What? love you so much but What? don't want to be a wife. What? don't want to make dinners, and do laundry and... I don't want to have children. What? Ever? Not now. Well, What? don't know what makes you think that What? want all that for you. I'm not asking you to be a housewife. Then why do you want to get married so bad? What is wrong with the way things are right now? You're happy, right? Yes, of course I'm happy. You don't even know what you want. What? think you're being silly about this. Look, I've got to go to work. Just... just know that What? love you more than anything in the entire world. And that, for me, when two people love each other, they express that by becoming one in marriage. Honey, I'm yours and you're mine. OK? I'm never going to be with another man again for the rest of my life. How much more expression do you need? Did you forget something? Er, no. Are you sure? See, What? need you. What? know. You have me. Something to think about when you're with those stuffy investment bankers all day. What? know, What? need to go. Look, the Bradfords are finally back. No, I'm pretty sure they drive a Cadillac. Hmm, What? wonder who that is. Well, maybe they got divorced and that's Miss Bradford's new husband. Funny. But that's impossible. Have a good day. Thanks. BANG FROM OUTSIDE Hey, Gavin. Slow down. Hey, Jen. Sorry, I'm just trying to make it to my desk before the London Stock Exchange closes. The London Exchange doesn't close for 30 minutes. Well, What? had a lot of our clients' money tied up in the UK markets, so, just trying to make my deadline. Well, What? need you to finish your analysis of the Whitmore project. Maybe we can meet for lunch and go over the numbers. Honestly What? don't think it's a great idea. If you don't mind, I'll just e-mail it to you. Why? Because What? am bogged down with my day-to-day routine. What? couldn't give you my undivided attention. You do realise we can work together even though we have a past. At least What? can. In any case, What? would appreciate it if you would treat me with a little more respect. What? am your superior, you know. Amazing. HE SIGHS VOICE FROM NEIGHBOURING HOUSE: Anne? Where you at? MALE SHOUTS NEXT DOOR: What? don't know why! When What? tell you to do something, What? want it done now! CRASH AND SHATTER Did you hear that? ALARM SOUNDS What? COUGHS KNOCKING KNOCKING CONTINUES What? smelled smoke. Kitchen. Where? Straight through there. HE COUGHS It's OK. CHUCKLES Oh, my gosh. It's fine. There's no fire. It was just this. Thank you. Are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just a little freaked out. Yeah. I'm Donald, but you can call me Donnie. I'm the new neighbour. Alex. Nice to meet you. So weird, What? didn't see a For Sale sign or For Rent or anything next door. Is everything OK with the Bradfords? Oh, yeah. No, it's still my aunt and uncle's place. I'm just watching it while they're out of town. They were thinking about moving the east coast, so What? could be around for a while. Great, well... Welcome to the neighbourhood. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah... No, you know... I'm going to just open some windows really fast. You know, What? was going to come over introduced myself but, What? mean, this definitely isn't how What? imagined that though. So, are you just in that big house all alone? Yeah. Yeah. What? guess I'm just the bachelor next door. It's more like the hero next door. No, it was not a big fire. Honestly, it was just a lot of smoke, you know. I'm such an idiot. What? was going to just run right out the front door and let the whole place burn to the ground. You saved our house. Thank you. And all your paintings? Oh, no. My paintings. My God! Looks like you put a lot of work into these. What? keep thinking What? should try something a little more commercial. But... Picasso didn't care about sales. Neither should you. You know, we're having a party on Saturday. You should come and meet some of the neighbours. No, it's OK. What? mean, What? wouldn't feel comfortable. Come on, after what you just did for us. It's very thoughtful of you, really. But, you know, What? did what anyone would do if they smelled smoke. That's not true. What? think a lot of people just call 911. I'm not going to take no for an answer. Well, OK then. Sure. In the meantime, let me help you clear up the kitchen. Sorry What? don't have bigger cups. No, no. These are great. Where'd you get these? They're cute, right? We brought them back from a little vacation. Hey, honey. Hi. Oh, my gosh. You're home early. Yeah, What? ran out as soon as the markets closed. This is our new neighbour, Donnie. Hey there, Donnie. Hi. Donnie actually saved our house from burning down today. What happened? Donnie smelled the smoke and ran over and literally saved the day. You know, What? think it was a short in this outlet here. Just, you know, for the future you might want to get a surge protector when you have that many appliances plugged in at the same time. So, you're an electrician? Well, no, but I'm a bit of a handyman. Huh. And you smelled the smoke from next door? Yeah. What? was outside working and What? Smelled it right away. What? actually invited Donnie to come to our party on Saturday. Yes. Yes, you should. Yeah, you should totally come. All right. Well, I'll get out of your hair. But, hey, it's good to meet you. Great to meet you. I'll walk you out. Thanks. Donnie, thank you so much. Absolutely not a problem. Hey, you guys want anything? I'll be right back. There's shrimp, there's chips, there's salsa. All sorts of stuff. Hey, where's Donnie? What? don't know. What? haven't seen him. Do you think What? should go over there and get him? Maybe he's just shy and doesn't want to be celebrated. No, look, here. If you pass these out maybe I'll go get him. I'll be right back. Thank you. What? got it. You're so sweet. You guys want one? KNOCKS Donnie. Donnie. Donnie. OMINOUS MUSIC What are you doing? Donnie. Hey. What? knocked and What? shouted a few times. Are you OK? Yeah. Thanks, but What? can take care of myself. I'm sorry. What? didn't mean anything by that. Erm... Party's started. We've want to have the guest of honour. Right. Come on. What? think Alex is waiting for you. Yeah. Sorry. What? just get a little anti-social sometimes, but... Yeah. No, of course. Come on. Let's go. OK. Yeah, well, What? inherited a bunch of money a few years back and it's just sitting in a bank, not earning a damn thing. Yeah. What's going on with the interest rates these days? What? know, it's painful. Interest rates are really low, so you're just not going to see anything out of a savings account. Best way to make money is stocks and real estate investments. You think What? could pick your brain sometime? Yeah. Yeah. No problem. What? dunno, it's just been in our family... Donnie's here. Oh, my gosh. What? thought you were standing me up. No, no. What? I'm sorry, I just, you know, What? saw all these people here and it looked a little daunting. No, don't be shy. There are so many nice new people for you to meet. Let me show you. Guys, this is Donnie. He just moved in next door. Donnie, this is everybody. Hi, I'm Sage. I'm Alex's little sister. Oh, hi. Yeah. So nice to meet you. What you did was really heroic. No, What? mean, it was nothing. No, you're wrong. You think it was nothing but the fact that you had the presence of mind and the bravery to spring into action. What? mean, What? find that impressive. She's giving you a compliment, it's OK to take it. OK. OK. You win. What? accept all of the accolades. Thank you, really. Yeah, well... You know what? Let me introduce you to Ginger and Marie. They're from a Ocilla, Georgia. They're hilarious, you're going to love them. Come on. What? saved a cat from a tree once. Did you? Stop being so jealous. Do you want me to make you a plate? Are you hungry? Yeah, sure. OK. DIALOGUE MUTED Oh, what have you done? What? don't know, What? think they're hitting it off, don't you? Yeah. Should we warn him? About what? What does that mean? Your sister's crazy. She's not crazy. She's unique. You are just full of impressive... Hey guys, you having fun? Oh, my God, yes. Donnie is an amazing guy. Did you know that he's travelled all over the world? And I'm not talking about the normal places like Hawaii or Europe. I'm talking about Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Cambodia. Wow! Really? Yeah. What? mean, what can What? say? What? do like travelling. Incredible. But, hey, What? need you guys travel somewhere else so we can clean up. Oh, no, I'll help you clean. Oh, no. Come on, you don't need to do that. It's fine. No, I'll be happy to. No, seriously, please don't. No, it's really not a problem. Honestly, we really like the quiet time, wiping encounters and doing dishes. It's brings us closer together. All that romantic stuff, you know? Yeah. Hey, babe, let's do the dishes. Yeah, hey. She's into it. Well, um, Donnie, why don't we move the party over to your place? I'll tell you what. You want to go to a diner or something? My place is just, you know, it's still kind of a mess. Yeah, we could go to John's deli. They'll let us sit there and talk all night, it'll be fun. Great. Come on. Perfect. Bye, guys. Bye. Thank you for the party. What? gotcha. Oh, God, thank you. Hi. Can What? help you? Yes, What? am here to see Gavin Burnett. Do you have an appointment? No. But he said What? could stop by any time. What? was in the area so What? thought I'd see if he's available. OK. What's your name? Donnie. What's your last name? Donnie's fine. I'm his neighbour, he knows who What? am. He's in a meeting, but I'll check to see if he can see you. Gavin. Yeah? There's a gentleman here that says his name is Donnie, says that he's your neighbour, said that you told him to drop by any time. He's here? Right here. Well, maybe What? did. That's what he says. Donnie, hey. Hey, Gavin. How are you? Good. Hey, hope you don't mind me dropping in on you. No, no, it's fine. What? mean, people normally make appointments, but it's totally fine. Good. Yeah. Because What? want to talk to you about investing that money What? told you about. Yeah, of course. I've never seen you with a client this early in the morning. Jen Green, Donnie. Donnie, my boss, Jen Green. Oh, it's nice to meet you, Jen. So have you two been working together for a long time? Well... Well, you could say that. Kevin and What? go way back. Oh, I'm sorry, What? didn't mean to create a problem here. Oh! No. No problem here. No. Uh, hey, my office is this way. Nice to meet you, Donnie. Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you, Jen. Grab a chair. Nice office, Gavin. Thank you. How long have you been in the financial business? Right about ten years. Wow, that is a long time. Gosh, you know, What? cannot seem to stick to anything for more than a year, so ten... It's extremely commendable. What? appreciate that. So, Donnie, what can What? do for you? My inheritance. Yes. What? would like to give it to you to invest. Now, What? know we just met, but... What? don't know, What? did my research on you and you seem to be on the up and up. You researched me. Well, sure, online. Doesn't everybody? Sure. What? guess. So what do you think? Well, What? typically advise my clients to diversify their portfolio among several different categories - Roth IRA, stocks, bonds, real estate investment trusts... VOICE FADES: That way if the market crashes... Hi. Hi. Hi, honey. I'm glad you came. So, um... Any interest? I'm sorry, babe. But listen, I've started promoting on social media. What? mean, I'm sending out postcards, I'm inviting people to come in. It just hasn't happened yet. What? just... What? feel like maybe I'm going too dark or something, or What? should be trying something more commercial. What are you going to do? Are you going to start making paintings for hotel rooms? What? just feel myself getting frustrated, and it's affecting my work. Alex, honey, art is a funny business, you know that. And what clicks with buyers... Sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't. There's no rhyme or reason. Well, What? need it to click. And soon. Thank you. OK. Bye. RECORDING: Hey, it's Sage. Leave me a message or I'll think you're a stalker. You haven't called me back since after the party. What? want to know all the juicy details. Call me, OK? Love you. KNOCK ON DOOR Hey, Alex. Hi, Donnie. Perfect timing - What? actually just got back from Gavin's office. Looks like I'm going to be investing with him. Oh, What? didn't realise you guys were meeting today. Well, yeah. What? mean, What? was just in the area, What? figured I'd stop by to see if he was in. But, yeah, What? liked what we had to say, so... OK, great. Anyway, picked this up for you at the store. Now, this should fix your outlet issue. It's a surge protector, so that way if there's a surge of electricity to one of your appliances, this will shut everything off before, you know, starting another fire. What? just have to plug it into your outlet and then plug the appliances into it. What? hope... Gavin doesn't mind, right? No, of course not. Great. Thank you. You have to let me reimburse you for that. No, absolutely not. It is worth every cent to me to know that you guys are safe and sound. So... How was the night cap with Sage? What? haven't heard from her since so... So great. God, she is... she's such a good girl. You know? We just... we just talked all night. God, thank you so much for introducing us. Of course. What? hope she's all right. You did drop her off at home, right? Yeah, dropped her off and then came right back here. I'm sure you heard me - we're so close to each other. Right. It's just not like her to not call me back. Well, she was having issues with her cell. What? don't know, maybe that was it. Alex, this is... this is so powerful. You like it? Do What? like...? What? love it. It says so much about you. I'm assuming this is about you. It seems so personal. Do you paint? Oh, God, no. No, no, no. No, but I'm a big art fan, you know. What? appreciate good stuff. You clearly have your own style, but it's... it's great. What is...? What is this one about? Oh... No, listen, it's OK. You don't have to say anything. What? mean, it's... it's personal. What? get it. Yeah. I'd, uh... I'd rather not. Say no more. But... You know, we all have those places. And What? just What? hope that eventually What? get to know you well enough that you can... you can go there with me. Just to discuss the inspiration for your... for your art, you know? You know, just like what drives you, that's all. Right. Um... Speaking of art, What? probably should get back to my paintings. Oh, yeah, of course. I'm sorry. I'll get out of your hair. OK... Great. If you hear from Sage, let me know, OK? What? will. But I'm sure she's fine. Anyway, I'll catch you later. I'll let myself out. Hey, keep up the good work. Thanks. DOOR CLOSES RECORDING: Hey, it's Sage. Leave me a message or I'll think you're a stalker! It's me again. Can you please call me back? I'm really starting to worry about you. OK. Hey, Donnie. Whatcha doing? Oh, hey, Gavin. You know, I just... l noticed that some of your hedges here were not symmetrical, so gave them a little trim. Alex put you up to that? No, but wanted to surprise you guys. You know we've got gardeners for this, right? Well, your gardeners are clearly not doing their job. Might want to consider firing them. Yeah. Well... What? appreciate the effort. Thanks for that. But... Maybe in the future check in with Alex or me first. Yeah. Yeah, of course. Gosh, this was... This was kind of presumptuous of me, wasn't it? It's totally fine, just for the future. Yeah, of course. I'm sorry. Don't be. That's fine. Oh, hey, Gavin. Look, What? found this. Now, you might want to think of a better way to hide your house key These fake rocks are... They're pretty obvious. Thanks, Donnie. Alex, I'm home. Hey. Alex, where you at? Hey, I'm in here. What's going on? What? heard you and Donnie talking outside. Then he went off to his house, and he started yelling and punching the wall like a crazy person. He totally freaked me out today. You know, me too. When What? pulled up just now, he was clipping our hedges. And, you know, he found our hide-a-key. What? mean, the spare was still in it, but still... You know, he's so familiar to me. Familiar? From where? What? don't know, it's like he doesn't look familiar to me, but he... His mannerisms, like, his body language, it's... What? know him from somewhere. You know, What? haven't heard from Sage since she left our house the other night? I've called, I've texted... Nothing. Listen, I've been thinking maybe we should get away. What do you think about going up to your parents' place for the weekend? Just you and me, you know. Maybe you'll get inspired. Yeah. OK. It looks like someone's here. You stay here, let me check it out first. MUSIC PLAYS SOFTLY Hey! Hey! What are you doing here? Sage... Where have you been? I've been here. What is wrong with you two? Your sister's been trying to get a hold of you all day. What? left you a message this morning saying What? was coming to the cabin. What? guess you didn't get it. No, What? didn't. You haven't returned any of my texts, e-mails, nothing. Yeah, cos What? have absolutely no service here. What? have to make phone calls at the gas station payphone. You'd think Mom or Dad could install a satellite dish here or something. What?! Oh, my... What?! Hey, Guys! What are you doing here? It's so funny. What? mean, What? got a call from Sage, and What? headed right up. Well, should we give them some privacy and go to a room at the Northwoods? What? No, no, don't do that. Yeah, no, stay here. We can all spend the weekend together. We can go hiking and fishing. We could sit around the campfire and make s'mores. What? actually think it's a great idea. Oh, that's great. I'm so excited. Yeah, we're going to have so much fun! Oh, you know what? Let's go make some appetizers. Well, this was delicious. Thank you. Donnie went to cooking school in Asia, so he loves to cook whenever he can. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Cooking, it's, uh... It's like therapy to me. Good stuff, man. So, Donnie... Cambodia, Sri Lanka, was it Swaziland? You travelled the world, What? know nothing about you. What's your story? Gavin, come on. Look, you don't... you don't need to tell us your life story. What? It's not like I'm prying. Yeah, no, it's... it's fine. What? don't mind. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. So What? Was born in Idaho, but... my parents died in a car crash when What? was five, so What? was sent to live with my grandparents in Cincinnati after that. Man. I'm so sorry, Donnie. No, it's OK. What? Listen, my grandparents and What? are really close, so What? just started calling them Mom and Dad. What? was always a really shy kid. It took me a few years after college, really, to start to, like, feel comfortable with myself, you know? Now, thankfully, when... What? mean, you know, when my parents did die. There was an insurance settlement, so What? inherited a large sum of money, and, What? mean, now What? don't... I don't have to work much. What? can just kind of travel around and, you know, What? don't know, do what What? want to do. So, what brought you to LA, then? Well, What? explained to Alex - I'm watch my aunt and uncle's place while they're out of town. No work or anything? Just house sitting? Gavin! What? What? don't mean anything bad by that. Well, no. If you must know, I'm actually also out here to visit an old friend. What? think that's very sweet, Donnie. So, um, who are you here to visit? Someone What? haven't seen in a long time. What? have some information that my friend needs to know. You didn't want to tell her over the phone? No. It's very personal and it's kind of a lot to take in, so... I feel like What? needed to be there in person to tell her. For emotional support? Yeah. Yeah, exactly. And when are you and this friend supposed to hook up? I'm going to meet up with her again soon. Anyway... That's enough about me. I'll tell you what. Why don't you two lovebirds go relax and Sage and I'll clean everything up? Oh no, you don't have to. No, listen, What? think it's important for us to do the mundane stuff together, you know - wiping counters, washing dishes. What? mean, hey, it clearly works so well for you two, maybe it'll work for us. Well, What? certainly appreciate that, Donnie. Thank you very much. Thanks. I'm sorry that Sage and Donnie are here. That's OK. We won't let them ruin the weekend. No, we won't. Well, What? think we make a pretty good team. Yeah. Yeah, What? would say so. Why are you the sweetest man in the whole world? What? love you so much. Alex. Yes? What is that? What? know you're not the traditionalist that What? am, but marriage for me is a lot more than just a certificate. It shows you that What? love you more than anything else in the entire world and What? will always put you first. You know, What? have to be honest, Sage, What? really didn't expect to meet anyone like you while What? was out here in LA. What? meet a lot of guys, and none of them are like you. Why are you so different? What? don't know what's... what's different about me? What? don't know, you're just... You're so aware of everyone around you. It's like you're always trying to figure out things to do to make their lives better. You're very altruistic, Donnie. Altruistic, huh? Yeah. You do things for other people without ever considering yourself. What? mean, you don't really find people like that in LA very often, or ever actually. Alexandra Marie... Will you marry me? Babe... I've been thinking about this a lot, and What? know that What? have been really difficult about this whole thing. But What? am really starting to realise... what marriage means to you and... I want to spend the rest of my life with you. What? love you, What? want to be old with you. Yes! Yes, I'll marry you. Oh! Thank you. Hey, guys. Oh, oops! Oh, sorry. HE CLEARS THROAT Guess what. Oh, my God, you said yes finally! Can you believe it's been ten years since Boulder? What? can't believe it. Wow, what... was holding you back? What? don't know. What? guess just... What? was being silly - the rebellion of it all, or the institution of it... What? don't know. What? was being silly, but I'm so happy. Me too. Good. Kind of sounds like you're trying to talk yourself out of it. What? mean, are you sure about all this? Whoa, hey, hey! Let's not go down that road. She said yes. You're not going back out on me, OK? Yeah. And What? want to go to a big wedding, so... Oh, yeah, it's going to be HUGE. It's a small wedding and it's going to be very special. Well, What? think we've all had a wonderful evening. We're going to go upstairs and... sleep. But, hey, let's... let's go fishing or something in the morning, yeah? Yeah, no, that sounds great. Bye. Goodnight, guys. Congrats. I've always loved you, Alex. What did you say? What? You just called me Alex. No. No, What? said Sage. No, you said Alex. What? I-I-I didn't. Yes, yes, you do. Get off. Wait... You said, "I've always loved you"? What the hell is that? What? don't know. Look, What? was sleep practically. What? mean, you can't be held responsible for what you say in your sleep. Um, yeah, you can. Sage, please. Look, What? made a mistake. Are you kidding me? I'm so sorry. Please. I'm... How long have you know my sister? What is that? The day of the fire is the first day What? met her. Well, you obviously have something for her if you thought What? was her. Oh, God, gross, I'm going to be sick. Wait, no. Wait, no, Alex... Er, Sage! Oh, my God, are you kidding me?! Donnie, just pack up and go. OK? No. This is over. Just leave. Did you hear that? Yeah, sounded like a door slamming. I'm going to go make sure she's OK. Yeah. Stupid, you're so stupid! How could you do that? How could you do that, huh?! SHOUTS: You're so stupid! AAARGH! SHE SNIFFLES Hey. You OK? Yeah, I'm fine. Sage, what's going on? Nothing, Alex. What? don't want to talk about it, OK? Why don't you just tell me what happened? Donnie and What? are just not going to work out. Guys come and guys go, and that's just the way it is for me. It can't always be like Gavin, so... What? don't understand. You know, What? don't need you to understand. Seemed like you guys were getting along really well... He said your name, Alex. What? We were kissing and he said, "I've always loved you, Alex." What? don't know what's going on between you guys, but it's over between us. So I'm leaving. Sage, What? don't... I'm so sorry. What? don't know why he would say that. Oh, really? No. You haven't seen the way he looks at you? How he looks at me? He doesn't look at me any way. Of course he does. You are not that naive, Alex. You know what, it's fine. I'll get over it. It's not like it hasn't been happening to me my entire life. What's going on? Oh, yeah. Alex has just been stealing my boyfriend since What? was 13, so nothing new. Sage, how can you say that? At least this time it happened pretty early on. Unfortunately, he still lives right next door to you guys, so don't expect me to come around the house as long as he's there. Enjoy the rest of your weekend. What the hell was that all about? What? don't know, she... She wouldn't tell me. She tells you everything. Well, let's go to bed. Come on, we'll get up early in the morning. ♪ To be here with me... ♪ PHONE RINGS Looks like we got reception again. Hey! ' Wow. OK. Thank you. I'll talk to you later. What? What? sold two paintings. Alex! That's amazing. Congratulations. Thank you. What is this guy doing? Is he actually taking our trash out right now? Looks like it. What's going on, buddy? Hey, guys. Uh, What? wasn't sure when you'd be home, so What? figured I'd help you out. You know, What? didn't want you to miss out on garbage day. Oh, well thanks. I'll take over from here. Yeah, of course. So... How's Sage doing? Is she all right? Yeah, yeah. What? think she's going to be fine. You want to tell me what happened? Uh, Sage... Look, she's great, you know? But she hasn't been in something serious in a while, and What? think... What? don't know, she just kind of got freaked out. Anyway, What? think it'd be best if What? just give her a little space, you know, just for now. That's probably a good idea. All right, well, I'll catch you guys. Hey, maybe tomorrow we can all grab dinner or something? Yeah, yeah, maybe. Maybe. Oh, whoa... Maybe? Well, wait, does...? What? mean, there's nothing wrong between you and me, is there?

"Rekindling what we had before Alex came along. "It's exactly what What? needed in my life. "I hope you're as happy as What? am." KNOCK ON DOOR Hi. Hi. Look, What? just wanted to apologise for the other night. You know, you and Gavin, you've been so good to me and What? shouldn't have just run out on you like that, but... Oh, my God. Are you all right? No... Well, Alex... What is it? You... Hey, can What? help? You can talk to me. Hey, listen. You can talk to me. I'm your hero, remember? What? think he's cheating on me. What? No, he... he just proposed to you. What? found an earring in the laundry basket and an e-mail from another woman. What? Do you know something? Donnie, you have to tell me if you do. Listen, What? don't... Look, about a week or so ago, there was a woman who... who came by looking for Gavin, and What? was outside working, she asked me some questions about you and Gavin. But, you know, What? saw her at his office. You know, What? OK, What? figured they're co-workers, What? don't... I don't think much of it. But... But the only strange thing is that she only showed up here when you weren't home. Did you get her name? Oh, yeah. Um... Oh, what was it? It was, um... Like Jerry or Jenny. Jennifer? Yeah. Yeah, it was Jennifer. God... What? know who that is. That's who the e-mails were from. They work together. What? mean, I'm sure it's just... No. They had a relationship before. It probably never ended. Why would he do this to me? Oh, it's OK. Oh, I'm so sorry. Hey, Alex? Alex? Gavin? Why are you with my fiancee?! Gavin! What? don't know who you are or what you think you're doing, but you stay away from us. Gavin! Get out, get out. Get out, get out! What the hell was that? Why was he hugging you? We were just talking. Talking?! He was feeling you up, his hands were all over you. Gavin, stop. When were you going to tell me? Tell you what? Just say it. Say what? That you're having an affair. Baby, What? don't know what you're talking about. What? saw the earring, and the e-mail, and Donnie said that he saw her here at the house. You're having an affair with Jennifer from work! Why would you propose to me if you're sleeping with somebody else this whole time? It's not true. Baby, What? swear to God. Just don't... CAR ENGINE STARTS This is insane. What? swear to God, I'm going to get this guy. Gavin... Gavin, where are you going? Donnie! Hey! 911, what is your emergency? Yes. Hello. What? need to report a road rage incident. I'm being followed by a mad man in a silver Chrysler. We are headed south on Nichols Canyon in the Hollywood Hills between Le Braye and Highland, towards Franklin. Please, please hurry. What? think he's got a gun. OK. Try to get to the Hollywood police station as safely as possible. I'll dispatch a patrol car. Great. Thank you so much. Please hurry. HE LAUGHS PHONE RINGS Alex. Gavin. He's not worth it. Please just come home and we can figure this out. This is not his fault, OK? What? was upset and What? hugged him. Then why did he tell you that he saw Jennifer? That's a lie! He is setting me up. What about the earring and the e-mails? There's no e-mail! Dispatch, this is unit 272. We've got eyes on the suspect, we're in pursuit. Oh, my God. He called the police. Alex. He called the police. I'm getting pulled over. I'm going to have to call you back. Driver, turn off the ignition, step out of the car, please. Oh, my God. Oh! What? Oh, yeah. You have to listen to me. This guy Donnie moved in next door and he's been stalking us. We thought he bought the place, but What? don't think so. He kept talking about an inheritance, but it's the Bradfords' house. It's their house. It's their house. He's living in their house. All right, let's take the conversation into the room. Hey, Alex, listen, don't worry. Everything's going to be fine. Soon enough, this is all going to make sense. Where are we going? We're going to the ranch, where there's no service. That way we can finally have some privacy. Seems like the appropriate place to go. That's your special spot, right? Where Gavin proposed to you. No, Donnie, please take me home, please. No. The ranch is better. Hey, look... It's going to be OK. You're just going to have to trust me on this. Can't you just... Can't you just let me go? OK, What? will release you. But first, let's talk about this Bradford issue. It's the house next door to mine. All right. How long has he been there? Hello, beautiful. Donnie, what's happening? We are finally all alone. What's going on? It's OK. Hey, Alex, I'm not going to hurt you. Where's Gavin? He's probably still in jail. No telling when he'll get out. RECORDING: No, Donnie, please take me home, please. No. The ranch is better. Well, he assaulted me and threw me out of your house. And he's the one having an affair! What a guy you picked, huh? You set that up. Yeah, What? guess it doesn't matter any more. Yeah, What? did. What? set it all up. Everything. Got to admit, that's a pretty good plan, though, right? But Gavin, he really dropped the ball on this. He cannot protect you. What? mean, it was so easy to get in the house and set up the cameras, the fire, everything. The smoke bomb and broken plug trick - Really? What? mean, What? cannot believe he fell for that. Why are you stalking me? What? am not stalking you. I'm helping you. What? promise you're going to see that. PHONE RINGS Gavin, this is Detective Miller. Gavin, we did some research and discovered the true identity of your neighbour, but he's not related at all to the Bradfords. In fact, I'm certain he doesn't have permission to live in that house. OK, so what does that mean? It means he broke in and he's staying there illegally. We have officers headed there right now. According to our records. Donnie's last place of residence was Boulder, Colorado, in 2007. Does that mean anything to you? Wait, did Donnie go to college with us? Is that why he's so familiar? But that would mean... Means what? Gavin, where are you right now? What? got a voicemail that she is with him at her parents' farmhouse. I'm heading there now. Whatever you do, don't confront him by yourself. Yeah, and he's there with my fiancee. What am What? supposed to do? You stay out of this. Give me the address and I'll call the local police. Gavin! Gavin... HE HANGS UP What? have been waiting ten years for this moment. What are you talking about? Look at me. You really don't remember, do you? What What? did for you? No, What? don't. I'm sorry. It's OK, it's OK. No, it's, uh... It's been a long time and I-l look very different. You don't even remember what What? did for you ten years ago?! What are you talking about? Our story starts off in the halls. Right after your favourite class. What? was nothing to you, but you were everything to me. What? would just... watch you... See you later. And worship you. Alex. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hey, Alex. Hi, I'm Donald. Hi. We're in art history class together. Oh. What? usually sit in the front row. You see me every time you walk into the lecture hall, I'm usually there early. Yeah. Sorry, What? don't remember you. No, sure you do. Sure. What? smiled at you yesterday, and you smiled back. Oh, What? did? Oh, I just... What? thought... Um... What? thought we had a moment. A moment? Um... Oh, OK. What? was just wondering if maybe sometime you wanted to... Johnny! Excuse me. WHISPSERS: Help me get rid of this guy. Oh, yeah. Hey, sorry, buddy, but she promised to help me study for a test. Sorry. You weren't very nice to me that first time, but What? wasn't about to give up. Then, on one fateful night, What? was walking down Pearl Street, looked in the window of a bar, and there you just happened to be. Alex, hi. Hi, it's me, Donald, from art history class. We spoke on campus the other day. Hi. OK, look, I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm just trying to get a moment to talk with you. Donald, look, um... I'm sure you're a really, really nice guy, What? just... I'm not interested. Not interested? I-I... Hm, uh... But What? just want... I'm just trying to be your friend. OK. Donald, you're really creeping me out, and I'm sorry. What? don't want to be friends. OK? It's how What? feel. Can we go? What? understand what peer pressure does to some people. Honestly, though, What? didn't think you were that weak. But What? forgave you. Johnny, stop! And then, can you believe it? What? actually coincidentally came upon you when you were in the most precarious and dangerous position of your life. Finally, What? had my chance to show you how much What? truly loved you. You'd better not tell a soul about this! Do you understand? We were... we were meant for each other. No, we don't. We belong to each other. No. This is... this is crazy. You're... you're insane. Argh! You're so ungrateful! Alex? Alex! HE LAUGHS Let it go, Donnie. Stay back. I'm not finished telling my story. What story? She's going to see who you really are, and then we are going to live happily ever. You see, the shocking part of our story... is that Gavin... was there! What? No, that's a lie. Check the police records. What? heard screaming. What? ran to the stables and saw someone getting their ass kicked by one of my fraternity brothers. What? ain't done with him! Alex, What? didn't even know you were involved! You've never said anything about this before. This is a fabrication. This is a fantasy. It's a lie! When What? talked to the police, they told me you were a hazing victim. What? didn't know who you were. What? swear to God. You're not turning me against him. Donnie... You stay back! I'm so sorry.
