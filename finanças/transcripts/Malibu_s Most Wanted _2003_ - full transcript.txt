There's crazy crime, drugs, and mad violence. Yeah, the streets is tough, but there ain't no streets tougher than mine. The streets of... [GUNSHOT] Malibu. It's hardcore up in the 'Bu, y'all, but it's just part of the everyday struggle. Things go down here people should never see. We got bag ladies, big ballers, everybody strapped with a nine. This is my ghetto, the mall. Most of the time, the police won't even come through. We got all sorts of sets up in here. We got the beach boys, the ACCs, the Abused Children of Celebrities, and this is my crew. That's my boy, Mocha. That brother straight-up crazy. He did time in public school. That there is Hadji. He's the Beast from the Middle East. And that's Monster. She had a big chip on her shoulder... till she ate it. Hey, that's me, B-Rad G. I run things around here. Now, sometimes, busters be disrespecting, and you can't punk out, no matter what the devil may bring. Hey, yo, fool. We about to have some hardcore drama go down right about now. That's right. This our mall. Always has been, always will be. Whoo whoo! Oh, Mr. Amerislani. Our clerk accidentally gave you the wrong aromatherapy candles. Here you go. [SNIFFS] You validate parking? Of course, sir. That's what I'm talking about. We get ours. [GUNSHOT] That's my crib. It ain't much, but it's all I got. And if you elect me governor... That's my pops, Bill Gluckman. He getting his campaign on. I got mad love for the man, but he's old school. He needs to bring his word to the street. That's where I come in. You see, friends... California is my family. And speaking of family, I want to introduce my wife, Bess, and my daughter, little Brenda. Where's your son, Brad? Yes, sir, where is he? I... It-- He's-- Uh, thank you for your questions. Unfortunately, we are out of time for today. [HIP-HOP BLARES] [WHIRRING] Yo, what's up, y'all? This is B-Rad G, kicking it from 'Bu, representing... Hi, Pops, it's me, B-Rad.

No, I talked to The Times and the Chronicle, and they're going to run it as a big joke. Oh, thank God! How in the hell did this happen? I have no idea. I didn't even know he was in town. Oh, for God's sake. We can't keep tabs on this kid? Can anybody tell me where this boy is? Hey, yo, pops. That was off the hinges! I just got you another million votes right there. What you doing here, son? Uh... Um, well, I knew I had to show up in order for you to blow up, so I called up Captain Tony, he fired up the Lear jizzy... and boo-yah! I'm in the hizzy. I'll be on the campaign trizzy too, 24/7. You know, kissing babies and whatnot. Pound it. Yeah, all good. Tom, you down, you gots... Okay, dude. I'll let you all do your campaign thing. What up, bro. Oh, Bill... You need to shut this down. You need to tell your son that he cannot be in your campaign, period. Oh, no, wait a minute. I love his enthusiasm. I mean, it's a little misguided, but... I mean, isn't there something he can do for the campaign where he can't hurt us? No. Uh, phones? No, no, no. No. No? Stuffing envelopes? Making signs? Signs. In Bill Gluckman's administration, women are going to have better health care. Women are going to have better daycare. Yeah! Yeah! And women will have better jobs. In fact, after today, my campaign has a new slogan-- [AUDIENCE GASPING] "Bill Gluckman is down with the bitches and the hos"? It was supposed to have read, "Women are first with Gluckman." No, no. That's old school, Pops. You need to keep your pimp hand strong. So, Bradley... Yo, why you keep calling me that? Well, that's your name, isn't it? It's my slave name, a'ight? I told you, like, 50 times. Okay. B-Rad. What's up? What are your goals, B-Rad? What do you want out of life? To be the biggest rapper there ever was.

I don't know. This is the most advanced case of "gangsta-phrenia" I've ever seen. Three colors for our country. Where's the red? Where's the red? Hey, Bill! Hey, Bill. How'd it go with Dr. Feldman? Oh, it went great. He says if he sees Brad five times a week for the next three or four years, we should see some real improvement. But, sir, the election is eight weeks away. Right, good point. Yeah, but it's okay, it's okay, because we've been brainstorming some different approaches here, and we might have something pretty solid. Well, I'm all ears. Go. Okay, uh, sir. Brad acts ghetto, right? But let's face it, he's never been east of Beverly Hills. But what if we give him a little dose of reality? Let him get a firsthand look at the ghetto. You mean have Brad actually go there? Exactly. Well, that-- See, now, that sounds dangerous. No. Perfectly safe. Well, how's it work? We hire actors to play gangstas. Right, they will carjack Brad, and then they will take him on a tour around the hood. It'll give him a taste of what the thug life is really like. It might just scare the black out of him. Excuse me? Ooh... Hey, don't you have something to do? Enough of the PC. Fact is, unless we do something now, Brad is going to cost us this election. Who would play the gangsters? Remember the anti-crime spot we shot a month ago? We've got that cued up. Yes, we do. Over here, please. CRIME SPOT NARRATOR: For too long, street violence has torn Californians apart. Bill Gluckman wants to put our divisions behind us. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey. Instead of thinking about what set you're from, or what crew you're rolling with, why don't you both be brothers? What do you say? Your hair looks great. I ain't never thought of it like that. Shake hands. You see? California is my family. [♪♪] If we all work together as a family, there's no telling how high we can go. See, that's beautiful. These are the guys. These are our two men we're talking about. All right, hold the phone, buddy. Let me get this straight. You want us to take this kid and scare him into acting like a little white boy again? Now, if you don't think you can handle it-- Oh, of course we can handle it. I'm from Juilliard, for chrissake. I'm from the Pasadena Playhouse. Good. I have some background information on our dear boy Brad. Materials. Mali-bootay? Yes, he considers himself a rapper of sorts. Oh, frigging A. Here's the story-- it is your basic kidnapping. Now, by kidnapping, you mean we hold him for ransom? Oh, good question. Right. Now, when you see him start to get ghetto, do his whole black thing-- Yes. That. I want it to piss you off. Tour him around the hood, around the ghetto, if you will, and... show him what it's really like. In the-- In the ghetto? Na-- Pays 15 grand apiece, son. BOTH: We're in. Good. Now, on the flip side... Flip it. If you two screw up, and a single hair is touched on Bradley's over-privileged head, I will see to it personally that you two do some serious time. Are we clear? Oh, we are crys-tal. I like that. Yeah. Oh, um, Mr. Gibbons, um... What about the money? Ooh! We have five upfront, and 25 when you return him to us... white. Oh, as the driven snow. Pleasure doing business with you, gentlemen. Oh, let me get that for you, sir. I'll call you. Or better yet, I'll holler. We'll holler back. Holler back, player. Thank you. All right. Wow! Congratulations, buddy. We just booked another gig. Listen, not so fast, this is dangerous stuff, all right? This is the ghetto. We could get shot. Oh, come on, man. We can handle ourselves. Right? Hey, hey, hey. This will be the ultimate acting challenge. You know what really chaps my ass? What? After all of our years of training and studying, they continue to give us parts that are gangbangers. Just once, I'd like to play a role-- someone who speaks with proper grammar and doesn't have to wear those disgusting Timberlands with the laces undone. It's so sloppy. Well, it beats getting dunked on by Bill Gluckman. Do we even know anybody that lives in the ghetto? My cousin. Shondra. Well, that's the stupidest thing I ever heard. I got better things to do with my time. Like what, Shondra? Work at Wiener On A Bun? Come on! Really, Shondra, you're always talking about improving yourself. Here's your chance. I am improving myself, fool. I broke up with no-good, gangbanging Tec, I'm going to beauty school, and then I'm gonna hook up my own salon, so there. How about hooking a brother up with some Pepsi and some French fries? Oh, shut up, stupid. PJ... What? Shondra, you need to do this. You need to walk away from this minimum-wage crap, take these earnings and start that beauty parlor you were talking about. What you paying? Business. We're in business. A grand. We're paying a grand. Make it tres, and we on. $3,000? Or you can kiss my ass. Deal. Hey, hey! Hey. Deal. Now, what about those fries? Thank you. Mm-hmm. Hey, Gladys? Yeah, baby. You ever feel like you don't belong? All the time. Most folk only feel comfortable around folk that's the same as them. They get around folk that's different, ooh, get all scared and angry, want to keep them down. What do you do about it? Nothing to do but keep it real and be proud of who you are. Gladys? Mm-hmm? When they gonna leave our people alone? I don't know, baby. Mm... I just don't know. Now, eat your greens before they get cold. "Whack-- "Weak, of poor quality. Bad." Whack...

Mr. Gluckman will be very happy. Now, it's gonna take a little bit more money than we originally projected, so that's why we were wondering if you could give us an advance-- No, no, no, no, no.

Don't panic. Just... Let me think this through here. You're just as guilty as any of us. Well... Now, we may just have a very interesting opportunity here. Where are you going with this? Well, the negatives are obvious. Yeah! Bill drops out of the race, emotional distress. I can handle Bill. What are the positives? Well, there are just so many. No more Brad problem. Uh-huh. Right. Right, I like that. Well, with a dead son, the sympathy factor could give us a huge spike in the female and gay demos. Wait, I've got the image: Bill, weeping over Brad's open casket. Then after grieving, he goes on the offensive. Bill Gluckman's war on crime! On drugs! Gangs. It's what's hot right now! Ooh, that's great! It's just what we needed!

Welcome to the Nines, baby. Only way out now... is in a box. In a box? In a box. Oh, in a box. Right. Good evening. I'm Hal Fishman. We open tonight with a Channel 5 News exclusive. A security camera captured incredible footage of gang violence tonight as it flared on the streets of South Central. This hardcore gangster, believed to be the notorious White Kong, ringleader of a South Central street gang, fired his weapons with wanton disregard for human life or personal property. If you have any information on the whereabouts of this man, call our KTLA hotline at 800-1-SNITCH. ALL: Oh my God! Yo, that is some hardcore shnizitz. Damn, Moch, what are we gonna do? A'ight. We're gonna bounce back to our respective cribs, jack our mom and dad's biggest gats, jet down to South Central and save his ass! Word. Hey, hey, Bradley's been involved in a gang shooting. What? No, no, no, it couldn't be. No. Yeah. His face is all over the news. I think I know my own son. All right, well, I'm sure there's a logical explanation. Why don't you go on upstairs, get some sleep, let me take care of it? Sleep? No. No. He's shooting the hell out of South Central. Come on, Tom. Let's go get him-- No! No, no, Bill. You have a debate tomorrow in Sacramento. The hell with the debate. Hey, hey. You cancel that, and you can kiss this campaign goodbye. Tom, you can shove the debate up your ass. I'm not going to lose my son over this election. Hey, listen, Bill, I understand you're upset, but for once in your life will you think outside the box? For once! Now, this whole thing, this whole Brad thing with the gangs, we can spin it and make it into a positive. Positive? Yes, if he's arrested or if he's injured, we can turn it so you're the victim. "Crime reaches everyone" kind of thing. Are you trying to get votes out of this? I'm trying to win, Bill, and you don't seem to care! I'm his father! Since when? Since right now. And you're fired. We need to brainstorm on how I get my job back. Hello. This is OnStar. I'm looking for a location of the license number D...SHIZNIT. That vehicle is at the corner of McKinley and 82nd Street, sir. What the hell are you supposed to be, Robo-bitch? All right Monster, what are you packing? This. What the hell is that? My pop's spear gat... from the yacht. What is he hunting, Flipper? Think you so bad. Well, what you got? Never mind. Come on, let's see it. All right, chill. Chill. Is that a freaking musket? Yeah, it's a freaking musket. Shut up! Shut up, you damn posers! Hadji, how about you? I couldn't get much, yo. Just this. Oh, my God. Damn! Where'd you get all that? Christmas present from Uncle Ahmet. OPERATOR: Mercedes Benz. May I help you? Hell, yes, chickenhead! I need a location on license plate number D-SHIZNIT. That car is on the corner of McKinley and 82nd Street. [HIP-HOP PLAYING] Where's he going? Are they making a sandwich?

No, you damn. Why you play me, huh? For the money. Money? What you need money for? Look, fool, this may sound stupid to you, but not everybody has money, and for the people who don't, money is important. Oh, please, you're probably still flipping me and whatnot. Damn it, B-Rad, this is real. Tec and his crew are real. Oh, really? Well, then if Tec is real, then this gat must be real, and if this gat is real, then the bullets in it have got to be real. And seeing how my foot is real, this would really hurt. See that? I just shot my foot. And it's real! Oh, my God, this whole thing is real! I just shot my foot. I just shot my foot. I just shot my foot. Sit. Stop hopping around, fool. Goodness. Oh, God. Oh, Shondra, I'm dying! This cap barely grazed you. I can't live! Lucky you such a weak-ass shot. It's real, Shondra. This whole thing is real! Stop moving. Hey, who doing all that popping up-- Oh, God. Hey, what the hell? Hey, what up, cuz? Hey, Tec! My road dog, yeah. Just the man I wanted to see. You know Shondra. Hey, what's going on, Shondra? Tec, I swear, it is not what it looks like. Don't you lie to me. That was always my line to you, and it always was what it looked like. Now, what's going on with your boyfriend, here? Hey, yo, dog, I'd love to kick it with you and run this whole thizang, but I got a little business back in the 'Bu, you know, a little something with Dre-Dre, so if you don't mind-- I do mind! Wait, Tec, let me explain. Because I don't belong here. What? You done forgot already, fool? I done told you. There's only one way out of the I-9, and your E-ticket's in this here chamber. There it is. Did you see how committed he was? Yeah. That's the rage I was talking about. Tec, please don't be hating. I won't let you do it, Tec. Fine. Then I'll just do the both of you, then. Damn, fool! You just hit my house! Brad? Pops? It's Mr. Gluckman. Brad, you okay? Not really, and unless you seriously strapped, you about to not really be okay too. Hi, guys. Bill Gluckman. Running for governor. We know who you are, fool. This dude think we ign'ant just cause we live down here. Mm-hmm. You better recognize. Well... I recognize. You know, I recognize that street violence is tearing Californians apart, and, fellas, California is my family. Oh, and here's a thought. Now, instead of thinking of ourselves as what set we're from, what crew you're rolling with, why can't we just be brothers? What do you say? Hmm... I guess I never thought of it like that before. You see that? Please. What do we say, brothers? Get your ass out of here. [CAR APPROACHING] Don't anybody know where the goddamn driveway is? Hadji? Y'all better step, or I'm a have to waste y'all up in this piece. Yeah, drop your gats! No, drop your gats! Hold up, y'all! Before anybody ices anybody, I got something to say. You really weren't gonna pay my ransom? Oh, I didn't know anything about that. You've got to believe me. That was not part of the plan. What was the plan? Send me down here to scare me white? I know, it was stupid. Look, I thought I'd tried everything, I didn't know how to deal with you anymore. You didn't know how to deal with me because you don't know me, and you never cared to find out. Listen, I made a lot of mistakes. I know that. I'm not proud of myself. I wasn't there for you. I can't change that, but I always loved you... and I still do, and if you say that this is who you really are... I believe you, and I... I accept you, and from here on in... I promise to be a real father to you. Well, talk is cheap. Prove it. Well, I'm here, ain't I? A'ight, Pops. We cool. Much love. I wish I could talk to my pops like that. No doubt.

Let's find our common ground." I was trying to keep the peace. Really, the explosion was just a metaphor. A metaphor for anger within our hearts.
