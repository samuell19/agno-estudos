- ﻿From time to time, ﻿she starts sneaking into Yamaga's house. ﻿Yamaga? ﻿The name of her first love. He's a high school classmate. ﻿He's not aware of her love for him. ﻿She doesn't want him to know, so that's OK with her. ﻿But she wants to know more about him. ﻿She wants to know everything about him, ﻿without letting him know about her. ﻿So she sneaks in. ﻿Right. ﻿When he's attending classes, she feigns illness and leaves early. ﻿Yamaga's an only child, and his dad's an office worker. ﻿His mom's a school teacher. ﻿So the girl knows there's nobody at home during the day. ﻿How does she sneak in? She's just an ordinary teenager. ﻿She takes a guess and searches under a potted plant by the front door. ﻿There's a key. ﻿What a careless family. ﻿She uses it to let herself into the house. ﻿She goes upstairs and opens a door. ﻿The number on the soccer uniform on a hanger tells her it's his room. ﻿The room is tidy for a 17-year-old boy, ﻿and she senses that he has controlling parents, his mom in particular. ﻿She breathes in. ﻿She listens carefully. ﻿She hears silence. ﻿An amplified silence, like the sound through a hearing aid, fills the room. ﻿She lies down on Yamaga's bed. ﻿She holds back the urge to masturbate. ﻿Why? The limits of a television drama? No. ﻿She has her own set of rules. ﻿Things she'll allow or won't allow herself to do. ﻿She can sneak into his house, but not masturbate there. ﻿Right. ﻿Then she leaves an unused tampon in his room. ﻿A tampon? ﻿- That's what you said. - That's so weird. ﻿More so than usual. Can this be adapted for TV? ﻿Don't worry. The producer said, it's for an innovative late-night slot. ﻿If you say so. ﻿So she takes out an unused tampon from her school bag ﻿and puts it in a drawer in his desk. ﻿What if his overprotective mom finds it? ﻿She feels a rush of excitement at the thought. ﻿She's kinky. ﻿The tampon is a token, indicating she was really there. ﻿A token. ﻿She continues sneaking in from time to time after that. ﻿She's aware of the risks. ﻿She's the type, who is trusted by her parents and teachers, ﻿so a lot is at stake. ﻿Nevertheless, she can't stop. ﻿She can't stop. ﻿She sniffs around in his room, longing for his slightest scent. ﻿She always takes a token from his room when she leaves. A pencil or something that he won't notice is gone. ﻿And in exchange, she leaves a token of herself. ﻿At her most daring moment, ﻿she took off her underwear and put it deep in his chest of drawers. ﻿She feels that they are gradually mingling by exchanging such tokens. ﻿And that she is giving him the strength to escape his mother's control. ﻿That's it for today. I ﻿see. ﻿Want to know the rest? ﻿Yeah, I do. ﻿Shall I wait, or shall I write it? Which? ﻿You can still wait. ﻿Yeah. I want to know the rest, too. ﻿You really don't know? I ﻿never do, do I? ﻿Well, I thought maybe this time it was about your first love. ﻿Of course it's not! ﻿Thanks. ﻿- Hello. - Hello. ﻿When does the curtain go up? ﻿6:30 p.m. Doors open at 6:00. I'll be cutting it close. ﻿Don't bother coming. You shouldn't slip out of a meeting. I'll bother. I want to see your play. ﻿- Break a leg. - Thanks. ﻿Not worth a curse. ﻿(You say we have to come back tomorrow?) ﻿Yes. ﻿(Then we can bring a good bit of rope.) ﻿Yes. ﻿(Didi?) ﻿Yes. ﻿(I can't go on like this.) ﻿That's what you think. ﻿(If we parted? That might be better for us.) ﻿We'll hang ourselves tomorrow. ﻿Unless Godot comes. ﻿(And if he comes?) ﻿We'll be saved. ﻿(Well? Shall we go?) ﻿Pull on your trousers. ﻿(What?) ﻿Pull on your trousers. Yes? ﻿May I come in? ﻿Come in. ﻿What? ﻿It was great. ﻿Yeah? I'm glad. ﻿May I introduce someone now? ﻿Yeah, after I change... ﻿Takatsuki. ﻿Hello, I'm Takatsuki. ﻿Your wife kindly invited me. ﻿Don't say "wife." I ﻿see you a lot on TV. ﻿Thank you. ﻿He's in my new one, too. A good role. ﻿He always has a good role. ﻿Better than ever. He's the heroine's love interest. ﻿Yes. ﻿When I mentioned your play during the production meeting, and ﻿he said he wanted to come. ﻿I'd heard about your methods and was interested. ﻿They're so different. Multilingual. ﻿I'm not sure if this is the right sentiment, but it was moving. ﻿Really? You're a strange young man. ﻿Oto, please. ﻿It's true. ﻿Yes, thank you. ﻿Don't thank me. ﻿I need to change, so maybe later. ﻿Excuse me. ﻿Good work. ﻿Sorry, did I wake you? ﻿You must be tired. ﻿My flight's Narita at 9:00, gotta run. ﻿See you. ﻿See you. ﻿You didn't have to come. ﻿Here. Uncle Vanya. ﻿I recorded it. About time you need it, right? Thanks. ﻿You'll miss your flight. ﻿See you. Take care. ﻿See you. ﻿Here, have some tea. ﻿I don't feel like drinking tea. ﻿How about vodka, then? ﻿Nobody knows how I feel. ﻿I can't sleep at night from frustration and anger. ﻿I've wasted my time. ﻿I could have attained so much from life, ﻿but it's too late now at this age. ﻿Uncle Vanya, that's so boring. ﻿You speak as if your former convictions were somehow to blame. ﻿But your convictions were not at fault. ﻿You were the one at fault. - - - - - - - ﻿- Hi there. - Hi. Did you get there all right? ﻿Yeah. ﻿Jury duty starts tomorrow? ﻿Yeah. ﻿How's your hotel? Comfy? ﻿They're all the same. ﻿Try any Vladivostok specialties. ﻿What's the specialty? ﻿I don't know, so I'm asking you. ﻿How lazy. A ﻿week later ﻿For 25 years he's been pretending to be someone he's not. ﻿Look at that swagger, acting like he's some kind of lord! ﻿You envy him, don't you? ﻿Yes, I do. I envy him a lot. ﻿Such good luck with women! ﻿Don Juan himself couldn't have had more experience! ﻿His first wife, who was my sister... ﻿Hey. ﻿What a relief. ﻿I'm OK. ﻿You're really all right? ﻿I don't know yet. ﻿They examined me. Still waiting for the results. ﻿Glaucoma in your left eye. ﻿Glaucoma? ﻿Damage to the optic nerve causing partial vision loss. ﻿Loss of vision in one eye is hard to detect because the other eye adapts. ﻿Which means that it doesn't impact daily activities, ﻿and by the time one notices it, it's often too late. ﻿You were lucky it was diagnosed early. ﻿Can I drive? ﻿It's not impossible. ﻿That means I can? ﻿Yes, if your symptoms don't worsen. ﻿How is it treated? ﻿The root cause of glaucoma is still unknown, so it can't be cured. ﻿The goal is to slow its progression. ﻿These eye drops lower eye pressure. ﻿You might doubt the effect, but you'll lose your vision if you stop using it. ﻿Make sure you use them twice daily. ﻿"Died February 25, 2001" ﻿You wanted to drive today, didn't you? ﻿Why? ﻿Well, you just got your car back. ﻿I love you dearly, but... ﻿What, all of a sudden? ﻿There's one thing I can't stand. ﻿What? ﻿Your driving. Face forward. ﻿Why didn't you change lanes just now? ﻿Hey, that could be considered verbal harassment. ﻿Honestly speaking... ﻿did you want kids again? ﻿I don't know. ﻿Nobody can take her place, after all. ﻿But we could have loved them as much. ﻿There's no use in me wanting something that you don't want. ﻿I'm sorry. ﻿It's not your fault. I made that choice with you. ﻿So it's all right. I ﻿really do love you so much. ﻿Thanks. ﻿I'm so glad you're with me. ﻿One day, she remembers her previous existence. ﻿You mean that girl who sneaks in? ﻿She used to be a lamprey in her previous life. ﻿A lamprey? ﻿She was a noble lamprey. ﻿She didn't leech off the fish ﻿that passed overhead like other lampreys did. ﻿She fastened her suction cup-like mouth to a rock on the riverbed ﻿and did nothing but sway there. ﻿Until she wasted away ﻿and really became like riverweed, ﻿she clung to the rock. ﻿She doesn't remember how she died. ﻿Did she starve to death? ﻿Was she eaten by other fish? ﻿All she remembers is swaying at the bottom of the river. ﻿In Yamaga's room, she suddenly understands. ﻿What she's doing here is the same. ﻿She can't tear herself away from his room, just like how she clung to a rock. ﻿Come to think of it, the silence in this room ﻿is very similar to under water. Time ﻿stands still. ﻿Past and present fade away. ﻿And she... ﻿becomes a lamprey again. ﻿She... ﻿begins to masturbate on Yamaga's bed. ﻿She strips off all her clothes one layer at a time. ﻿She'd forbidden herself from doing it, ﻿but now she can't stop. ﻿Tears fall, ﻿wetting the pillow. ﻿She thinks that those tears are her token for today. ﻿Just then, someone comes home. ﻿A door opens downstairs. ﻿She notices then that it's starting to get dark outside the window. ﻿Is it Yamaga? ﻿Or his father? ﻿His mother? ﻿She hears that person coming up the stairs. ﻿It's over. ﻿But now, she can stop at last. ﻿At last, it'll all end. ﻿She can finally escape the karmic fate from her prior life. ﻿She'll become a new person. ﻿The door opens. ﻿"Neither eel nor fish!? Lamprey." ﻿Do you remember yesterday's story? ﻿Sorry, I don't remember clearly. I was pretty much asleep. I ﻿see. ﻿Sorry. ﻿That just means it wasn't worth remembering. ﻿I have to go. ﻿You have plans today? ﻿I'm teaching a workshop. Didn't I tell you? No. ﻿Sorry. ﻿Are you driving? ﻿Yeah. ﻿Sorry, I still had it. ﻿Thanks. ﻿Can you handle it? ﻿- I'll be fine. See you... - Yusuke. ﻿When you return tonight, can we talik? ﻿Of course. Why do you ask? ﻿-	Have a nice day. -	You too. ﻿Is she faithful to him? ﻿Yes, unfortunately. ﻿Why unfortunately? ﻿Because that woman's fidelity is a lie through and through. ﻿There's an abundance of rhetoric, but no logic in it. ﻿My life is lost, ﻿there's no turning back. ﻿That thought haunts me like an evil spirit day and night. ﻿My past went by without event. It's unimportant. ﻿But the present ﻿is worse. ﻿What should I do about my life and my love? ﻿What happened... ﻿When you speak to me of love and romance, ﻿I feel like I'm in a daze ﻿and don't know what to say. ﻿Oh... Lord, have mercy. ﻿Sonya. ﻿I'm miserable. ﻿If you only knew how miserable I am. ﻿What can we do? We must live our lives. ﻿Yes, we shall live, Uncle Vanya. ﻿We'll live through the long, long days, ﻿and through the long nights. ﻿We'll patiently endure the trials that fate sends our way. ﻿Even if we can't rest, we'll work for others ﻿both now and when we have grown old. ﻿And when our last hour comes ﻿we'll go quietly. ﻿And in the great beyond, we'll say to Him ﻿that we suffered, ﻿that we cried ﻿that life was hard... ﻿Oto. ﻿Oto. ﻿Oto. ﻿Hello? ﻿Please send an ambulance. ﻿"Oto Kafuku Funeral Service" ﻿So sudden... a cerebral hemorrhage. ﻿For 25 years he's been pretending to be someone he's not. ﻿Look at that swagger, acting like he's some kind of lord! ﻿(You envy him, don't you ﻿Yes, I do. I envy him a lot! ﻿His first wife, who was my sister, ﻿was a wonderful, kind woman. ﻿And she loved him from the bottom of her heart, ﻿the way an untainted, noble human loves an angel. ﻿And his second wife, as you can see, is a lovely, smart woman. ﻿Why? (Is ﻿she faithful to him?) ﻿Yes, unfortunately. ﻿(Why unfortunately?) ﻿Because ﻿that woman's fidelity ﻿is a lie through and through. ﻿(Vanya...) ﻿(Don't talk like that.) ﻿(Come on...) ﻿(Shut up, Waffles.) ﻿(No, I'll have my say. My wife took off with her lover) 2 years later ﻿Of course.. ﻿I'm sure that ﻿the truth ﻿no matter what it is, isn't that frightening. ﻿What is most frightening ﻿is not knowing it. ﻿"Hiroshima Arts and Culture Theater" - ﻿- Are you tired after the long trip? - Not at all. ﻿Long time no see, Ms. Yuzuhara. ﻿Let me introduce you. Yoon-su will participate as the dramaturge. ﻿We've exchanged e-mails. As we explained over e-mail, ﻿your residency will be for 2 months until December, starting today. ﻿6 weeks of rehearsals and 2 weeks of performances. ﻿Auditions will already begin tomorrow. ﻿Here are the audition sheets. ﻿Thank you. ﻿We informed theaters around Asia ﻿and received applications from Korea, China, Hong Kong, ﻿Taiwan and the Philippines. ﻿Yes. ﻿I'll interpret Korean. ﻿People who can speak English will communicate with you directly. ﻿Yes. ﻿Actors from overseas were recommended by the local theaters' program directors. ﻿And we also received many applications from within Japan. ﻿Even I recognize some faces. ﻿I'll have a look. Can't wait. ﻿Now let's go to your residence. ﻿We found a place about an hour away by car, just like you requested. ﻿Thank you. ﻿On a scenic island, since you're here. ﻿An island, huh? ﻿Also, we've hired a driver for you according to our rules. ﻿So our driver will be handling your car, is that all right? ﻿About that... I'll drive my own car. I've got insurance. Please don't mind me. ﻿This isn't about hospitality, actually. We can't let you drive. ﻿What do you mean? ﻿An artist ran over a person by accident in the past. ﻿Yes. ﻿It was terrible. Since then, it's become the rule ﻿to provide a driver for our resident artists, no exceptions. ﻿I go over my lines while I'm driving. ﻿It's an important routine for me. ﻿That's why I asked you to book a hotel some distance away. ﻿We're sorry. ﻿We should have explained to you more clearly. ﻿There's a budget set aside for it, so the theater festival has to use it. ﻿If it concerns you, you're welcome to test our driver. ﻿But don't worry, the driver is very skilled. ﻿Let's go. ﻿Thank you for your understanding. I'll follow you in the official car. ﻿She's your driver. ﻿I'm Misaki Watari. ﻿This is Mr. Kafuku, our stage director. ﻿The festival hires her every year. She knows the roads well. ﻿She's an excellent driver. ﻿Nice to meet you. ﻿Sorry, but I still haven't agreed to having you as my driver. ﻿Is a test drive OK with yen? ﻿Yes, of course. ﻿No, I'll drive after all. ﻿I'm sorry. ﻿Is it because I'm a young woman? ﻿That's not why. ﻿This car is pretty old and has quirks. It's not easy the first time. ﻿Very well. ﻿Then if you sense any danger in my driving, you take the wheel. ﻿How does that sound? ﻿Do you prefer the passenger seat? ﻿Any problems with ﻿the electrical components? ﻿No, none. ﻿Sorry, but you said it was an old car, so I had to make sure. ﻿I've driven it 15 years and no problems. I ﻿see. ﻿Could you play the cassette tape? ﻿The cassette tape? ﻿Yes. I'm leaving. ﻿Vanya, please just drop it. Do you hear me ? ﻿I refuse. ﻿Wait, I'm not done yet. ﻿You destroyed my life. ﻿I've never lived. ﻿Because of you, ﻿I wasted the best years of my life and spoiled them. ﻿You're my foe. My bitter enemy. ﻿You fool. ﻿If this estate is yours, then take it. ﻿I don't want it. ﻿I'm leaving right now. This is like hell. ﻿I can't stand it. ﻿I'm gifted and intelligent. Courageous, too. ﻿If I'd lived normally, I might have been another Schopenhauer or Dostoevsky. ﻿I'm sick of this nonsense. ﻿I'm losing my mind. ﻿Mother, I can't take it anymore. ﻿Listen to the professor. ﻿Mother, what should I do? ﻿No, never mind. Don't say anything. I know what to do. I'll make you pay for this. ﻿Oh, I'll do it. ﻿What do you think? ﻿The Setouchi sea is tranquil and lovely. ﻿Her driving, I mean. I'll come pick you up at 8 a.m. tomorrow morning. ﻿OK. Sorry it's so early. ﻿No problem. ﻿Shall I play the tape? ﻿Yes, please. ﻿Uncle, are you crying ﻿I'm not crying. It's nothing. Don't be ridiculous. ﻿Your eyes when you looked at me now looked exactly like your dead mother. ﻿Oh, Sonya. Your mother, ﻿my sister, where is she now? ﻿You've been ill for such a long time. ﻿Sonya's mother Vera used to stay awake ﻿at night for you, too. ﻿She must have been so worried. ﻿(Let's go, Marina.) ﻿Hey, I haven't finished my lines yet. ﻿Oh, well. ﻿My own feet are in pain as well. Such a throbbing pain. - Ok, thank you very much. - Thank you. ﻿Next, please. ﻿Excuse me. - - ﻿Koji Takatsuki. I'm trying out for Astrov. ﻿You both requested the same scene, so enact it as a pair. Yes. ﻿So she's Yelena, and where from? ﻿From "You are a cunning woman." ﻿Yes. - ﻿I don't understand what she's saying. Is it OK if I try to wing it? ﻿Yes, go ahead. Whenever you're ready. ﻿Oh, you are a cunning woman! ﻿(What do you mean?) ﻿How cunning you are! ﻿Assuming Sonya is suffering, let's set that aside for now. ﻿But.. ﻿(What are you saying?) ﻿You know perfectly well ﻿why I come here every day. ﻿You know why and for whose sake I come! ﻿- You're a tigress! My sweet... - (A tigress?) ﻿(What do you mean?) ﻿A sleek, enchanting tigress... ﻿You must have your victims! ﻿(Are you out of your mind?) ﻿How coy you are. ﻿(I'm not the kind of woman you think I am.) (I ﻿swear, I'm not that vulgar.) ﻿No need to swear. Don't waste words. ﻿You're so beautiful. ﻿Such lovely hands. ﻿(Enough of this!) ﻿Listen to me. ﻿This is fate, it's inevitable. ﻿(Please stop this.) ﻿(Let go of me.) ﻿Meet me in the forest tomorrow. ﻿At 2 o'clock. ﻿All right? Be there. ﻿Be there, OK? ﻿(Let me go!) ﻿That's enough. Sorry about that. Thanks. ﻿The next person is the last one. She's a bit different. ﻿(Come in.) ﻿She's Lee Yoon-A. ﻿She's saying she uses Korean sign language. ﻿You understand it? ﻿Yes. ﻿(Nobody else chose this scene, so you'll audition alone.) ﻿She can hear. ﻿I'll translate in Korean if necessary. ﻿Will that be OK? Yes. ﻿(Please begin). ﻿Uncle Vanya, did you take the morphine? ﻿Give it back. ﻿Why do you make us worry? ﻿Give it back, Uncle Vanya. ﻿My misfortune could perhaps be greater than yours, ﻿but I don't give in to despair. ﻿Until my life comes to a natural end, I'll keep enduring it. ﻿So, ﻿you must endure yours, too. ﻿My dear and only Uncle. Please. ﻿Give it back. ﻿Have pity on us. ﻿You must endure your sorrow. ﻿Thank you. ﻿Not too many auditioned for the part of Vanya. ﻿You're right. ﻿Everyone probably thinks you'll be playing the role. ﻿Sorry, it's so late. ﻿No problem. - - - ﻿Serebryakov, Roy Lucelo. ﻿Yelena, Janice Chang. ﻿Sonya, Lee Yoon-A. ﻿Voynitskaya, Kaoru Komagata. ﻿Vanya, Koji Takatsuki. ﻿Astrov, Ryu Jeong-Eui. ﻿Telegin, Takashi Kimura. ﻿Marina, Yumi Eto. - ﻿Excuse me. You want me to play Vanya? ﻿Yes. ﻿There's quite an age-gap. ﻿You can wear make-up. Everyone's role doesn't match their actual age. ﻿If уош'ге unwilling, then don't sign. ﻿The role will go to someone else. ﻿When you finish signing, we'll start reading the script. ﻿(Superb! How wonderful!) ﻿(What a stunning view.) ﻿The view is indeed wonderful, your Excellency. ﻿Mr. Kimura, please say it slower. ﻿- Slower than that? - Yes, ﻿And enunciate more clearly so that everyone can hear. ﻿OK. ﻿Continue. ﻿The view is indeed wonderful, your Excellency. - - ﻿Ladies and gentlemen, tea is ready. ﻿(If you don't mind...) ﻿(Hush, someone will hear you.) ﻿No, let me say that I love you. Don't drive me away. ﻿That's all I need to be happy. ﻿(I can't stand this.) ﻿Thank you. Let's stop here for today. Good work. ﻿Aren't you cold? ﻿Not at all. ﻿From now on... ﻿Yes? ﻿Could you wait in the car when I'm running late? ﻿I feel uncomfortable knowing you're waiting in the cold. ﻿No, thank you. ﻿I know you cherish this car, so I can't relax. ﻿If you know that, then it's no problem. ﻿Just smoke outside. ﻿Fine, then. Only when it's really too cold. ﻿Shall I play the tape? ﻿Yes. ﻿But allow me, as an old man, give one word of advice before parting. ﻿Everyone, the important thing is to work. ﻿You must keep working. ﻿Mr. Kafuku. ﻿Could I invite you out for a drink? My car is here, too. ﻿You're driving? ﻿Yes, so if you don't mind, how about the bar at my hotel? I'll be a bit late. ﻿No problem. ﻿I'll bring my car around, then. ﻿Please follow me. ﻿I actually sometimes do a search on your name online. ﻿That's how I found this audition ﻿and that day was the deadline. Isn't that amazing? ﻿Why are you interested in me? I ﻿really liked acting out Oto's screenplays. ﻿Saying her lines made me happy. ﻿My theater projects and Oto's screenplays are different things. ﻿Yes. ﻿But when I saw your play that time, ﻿I felt that what you two were doing were the same, albeit in different ways. ﻿How so? ﻿Tough question. ﻿I get the feeling that you both value ﻿the finer details that people won't even notice. ﻿I actually like things like that. ﻿But I wouldn't have known if I hadn't acted out Oto's scripts. ﻿When I saw the casting call, I knew this was my only chance. ﻿I'm not sure if you know, but I'm working freelance now. ﻿I know. Though in my case I didn't have to look you up. ﻿Is that so. ﻿That's embarrassing. ﻿How stupid. ﻿You were a star. ﻿No, I was framed. ﻿Do you do things like that often? ﻿Things like what? ﻿With women you barely know. ﻿Don't you? No. ﻿Lots of women must approach you, too. ﻿All you have to do is say no. ﻿I don't do it with just anybody, either. ﻿If you click and want to get to know her better... Not ever? ﻿Sex isn't the only way to get to know someone. ﻿But some things you can't know unless you do it. ﻿- Like what? - Like... ﻿What's the matter? ﻿Just that.. ﻿why am I talking to you about this? ﻿Oto must have been happy with a husband like you. ﻿I wonder. ﻿If you don't mind, could you tell me something about her? ﻿Something about her? ﻿How you two met, ﻿how she wrote her screenplays, ﻿everyday conversations. Anything. ﻿Here's what you're thinking. ﻿"He and I share the same pain, because..." ﻿"we loved the same woman." ﻿Oh please. Mine was just an unrequited longing. ﻿You were in love with her. ﻿I don't deny it. ﻿She was lovely. Very much so. ﻿Yeah. ﻿So I'm jealous of you, Mr. Kafuku. ﻿Forgive me. ﻿You're jealous... ﻿of me? ﻿Excuse me. ﻿You took a picture, didn't you? ﻿You took one just now. ﻿Delete it. ﻿What's the matter with you? ﻿I'm leaving now. ﻿Yes. ﻿-	The check, please. -	Yes, sir. ﻿I'm sorry. ﻿I invited you today. ﻿It's OK. ﻿I'm glad to be here now, to be able to perform under your direction. ﻿I believe Oto brought us together. ﻿I look forward to working with you again from tomorrow. ﻿Yeah. See you tomorrow. ﻿What's the matter? You look so glum. ﻿Is it because you feel sorry for that professor? ﻿Leave me alone. ﻿(Or because you're in love with his wife?) ﻿She's a good friend of mine. ﻿(Already?) ﻿What do you mean by "already"? Stop. ﻿Still too much emotion? ﻿Ryu i's doing it right. Emulate him. Continue. ﻿(There's a proper order for a woman to become a man's friend.) ﻿(First, she's an acquaintance,) ﻿(then she's lover, and finally, she becomes a good friend.) ﻿What a banal philosophy. ﻿Takatsuki. ﻿Try focusing on your text. All you have to do is read it. - - - - - - ﻿From where we left off, then. ﻿I didn't get him? I missed again? ﻿Damn it. ﻿God damn it. ﻿(Get me out of here. Kill me if you must.) ﻿(I can't stay here anymore.) ﻿What's wrong with me? What am I doing? - ﻿Good work, everyone. ﻿Mr. Kafuku. Yes? ﻿Could we do a little interview for the festival website? Yes. ﻿We need a video, so somewhere outside. ﻿All we do is read the text. ﻿When will we start moving? ﻿Honestly, the foreign language-parts lull me to sleep. ﻿- Me too! - Me too. ﻿- Though not in a bad way. - Yeah, it's like hearing a sutra. ﻿Sounds like a blessing when you put it that way. ﻿Yoon-su, where did you learn Japanese? ﻿I studied Noh in graduate school at Waseda University for 2 years. ﻿Korean, English, Japanese, and sign language. That's awesome. ﻿Japanese and Korean have similar grammar, so learning the vocabulary is enough. ﻿I've liked English from a young age. ﻿When did you learn sign language? ﻿Mr. Kafuku, you kindly offered to take me home. ﻿May I invite you over for dinner today? ﻿No, I don't want to intrude. ﻿There's something I have to apologize to you about. ﻿- What is it? - You'll know when we get there. ﻿Both of you, please come inside. ﻿Let's go. He probably doesn't feel comfortable making you wait hungry. ﻿There's no need to worry about that. ﻿I wouldn't worry. But I'm sure he will. Come on.﻿ ﻿My wife. ﻿She says it looks like me. ﻿That's mean. ﻿These potatoes are from the back yard. She grew them. ﻿This Is what I wanted to apologize to you about. ﻿Why didn't you tell me? ﻿She worried you might find it hard to reject her, if you knew she was my wife. ﻿No, I... ﻿You wouldn't mind, I can tell. ﻿But silence is golden. ﻿To answer your question, I learned sign language after meeting her. ﻿I wanted to know her language so I learned it. ﻿That's really something. ﻿She's originally a dancer, ﻿and I was the coordinator when her dance company performed in Busan. ﻿Love at first sight. ﻿Don't tell her. ﻿Why Hiroshima? ﻿I was invited to the theater festival 3 years ago. ﻿And Yoon-A came with you? ﻿Yes. When I got the offer, I debated whether or not she should come along. ﻿In Korea, she has family and friends who know sign language. ﻿I thought she would be lonely here. ﻿But I figured I could listen to her like a hundred people. ﻿I felt that I'm the only one, who could support her. ﻿Why did you decide to audition? ﻿"I got pregnant and took time off from dancing," "but had a miscarriage." ﻿"Although I wanted to work again, my body refused to dance." ﻿"That was when my husband told me about you and suggested I try it." ﻿Thank you. ﻿Is there anything hard about rehearsals? ﻿"Why do you ask me something, that you don't ask others?" ﻿"You don't have to be nicer to me than you are to other people." ﻿"People not understanding my words is normal for me." ﻿"But I can see and hear." ﻿"Sometimes I can understand a lot more than words." ﻿"That's what's important in our rehearsals, right?" ﻿Yes. ﻿"So right now, every day is so much fun." ﻿Chekhov's text comes inside me and" ﻿moves my body that was stuck before." ﻿"I'm glad I got my courage up." ﻿Glad to hear that. ﻿Do you like spicy food? ﻿Yes. It's good. ﻿How's her driving? ﻿It's fabulous. ﻿She speeds up and slows down so smoothly, I hardly feel gravity. ﻿Sometimes I forget I'm in a car. ﻿I've experienced many people's driving, but it's never been so pleasant. ﻿I'm glad she was assigned as my driver is how I feel now. ﻿"Compliment us actors as much for once," she says. ﻿This means, "to compliment"? ﻿Yes. ﻿Thank you for inviting me. ﻿It was Yoon-su who invited us. ﻿They were a lovely couple. ﻿Now I'm curious about your rehearsals. ﻿Yoon-A's Sonya. ﻿I've been hearing your tape, so I kept thinking, "She's Sonya." ﻿You're welcome to watch. ﻿No, thank you. I'm sorry. ﻿- Come watch us... - Shall I play the tape? ﻿Yeah. ﻿Vanya, you're educated and intelligent, ﻿so you must surely understand ﻿that the world isn't destroyed by villains... ﻿Don't you get sick of hearing this? No.﻿ ﻿I like this voice is why. ﻿see. ﻿Whose voice is it? ﻿My wife. ﻿Oh. ﻿The flow of the entire play has to be memorized with my method. ﻿So I listen to it over and over. ﻿I acted in Uncle Vanya before, so Vanya's parts are left out. ﻿When I say my line at my pace, the next line starts precisely. ﻿Wow. ﻿What I said before is true. ﻿I forget that I'm in the car and forget that you're here. ﻿Annoying, isn't it? ﻿No, it's your job. ﻿Where did you learn to drive? ﻿My hometown. ﻿Kami-junitaki Village in Hokkaido, ﻿where you need a car to do anything. ﻿Oh. ﻿My mother taught me to drive, ﻿and I've done it since junior high. ﻿Junior high? ﻿Yes. ﻿My mother worked at a nightclub in Sapporo. ﻿She took a train there, so ever since junior high ﻿I drove her to and from our local station. ﻿The station was an hour away. ﻿We left the house at 5 p.m. and I picked her up at 7 a.m. ﻿During those two hours, ﻿my mother wanted to sleep. ﻿If I woke her with my driving, she'd kick me in the back ﻿and hit me when we arrived. ﻿That's how ﻿I learned to drive over bad roads without waking her. I ﻿see. ﻿What you said made me very happy. No. ﻿I'm grateful to my mother for teaching me how to drive. ﻿It was for her own sake, but the way she taught me was thorough. I ﻿see. ﻿Yes. ﻿No doubt it must have been so. ﻿Will you tell me the whole truth afterwards? ﻿Yes, of course. ﻿I'm sure that the truth, ﻿no matter what it is, isn't that frightening. ﻿What is most frightening ﻿is not knowing it. ﻿Oh, to flirt with a man like him and to lose oneself in his arms.
