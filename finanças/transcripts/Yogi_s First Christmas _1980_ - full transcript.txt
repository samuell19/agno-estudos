No kidding, Augie? You're right, son. That's the Jellystone Winter Lodge. My favorite Christmas hangout. That's for sure. 'Tis the season to be jolly in Jellystone, even. A whole week of riotous revelry... ...gaiety galore and lots of fun, even. Gosh, and poor old Yogi and Boo Boo are gonna miss all them tasty vittles. That's sad. Bears never get to have any Christmas fun. Thank goodness Yogi's hibernating. We had enough trouble here last year without him. You mean all them scary things that were happening all the time? Like that big old snowball... -...that crashed into the lodge? -Yup. And stealing the Santa Claus suit... -...from my prize-winning snowman? SMITH: Uh-huh. And night howling outside at night. [HOWLING] Never did find out who was doing it. But if they try that scary stuff this year, I'll know what to do. Me too, also, even. Exit stage right. Come on, let's hear that song again, group. ALL [SINGING]: It's about that time For laughter to ring again Favorite carols-- That Christmas crowd is back again. Ugh! Well, this year, I'll scare them good. Christmas-- Yuck! --with all that goody-goody singing. Eh, bah! Ach! Here they come. Do you think they know anything about it? No, no. And I'd hate to be the one to tell them. Here we are. Everybody out. Careful, Augie. Watch your step. Oh, I will, dear, old Dad. Hello there. SMITH: It's the manager, Mr. Dingwell. Howdy there, Mr. Dingwell. DINGWELL: Welcome to the Jellystone Lodge. Ahh! Help, dear, old Dad. DOGGIE: Oh, no. That's Augie. Stop the drum. [YELLING] Heavens to Murgatroyd. He vanished into skinny air. Disappeared, even. Don't worry, Snagglepuss. I'll find him. [DINGWELL GRUMBLING] Would you mind getting off my back? Oh! Uh-- Ha, ha. Er, sorry, Mr. Dingwell. Augie, my boy, where are you? AUGIE: Right here, dear, old worried Dad. Hi. Heh, that was fun. Next time, I'm buying you a square drum. HUCKLEBERRY: Like, um, where is everybody, Mr. Ranger? Group, Mr. Dingwell has some good news and some bad news. Oh, yes. First, the bad news. This may be the last Christmas you'll spend here. ALL: Huh? They're planning to build a freeway over this mountain. But they can't build the freeway... ...unless the owner, Mrs. Throckmorton, sells the lodge to them. Don't tell me she's gonna sell. DINGWELL: Yes, because of all those weird things... ...that happened here last Christmas. The guests just didn't come back. Business this year is practically nil. What do you mean, "nil"? You got paying customers here. -Huck and Snagglepuss and me. -And me too. Do I look like a nil? Just a minute. Just a minute. Let's not lose our cool. How's about, uh, giving out with the good news? Well, the good news is that Mrs. Throckmorton will be here... ...for the final Christmas carnival week. If we can all make sure... ...that Mrs. Throckmorton enjoys her stay here... ...she may decide not to sell the lodge. You can count on me to hold forth with all my charm. Or fifth, even. I could always sing, you know, uh, "Clementine." Yeah, everybody will get into the act. Me too, dear, old Dad. Let's face it, group. Nothing must go wrong. Especially the big tree-trimming party on Christmas Eve. You're lucky that troublemaker Yogi is fast asleep in his cave. Oh, yes. We'd really have something to worry about then. Okay, gang, hit it. ALL [SINGING]: It's about that time That time of the year again Sleigh bells ring That season is here again HUCKLEBERRY: Hearts are light And full of good cheer again ALL: Coming up Christmas time Parties, friends, we're all on the go again BOO BOO: You better bundle up It's starting to snow again ALL: See you under that mistletoe again. YOGI: Hey, hey, hey, what's this? ALL: Coming up Christmas time With the beat, beat, beat of my feet, feet, feet? Maybe spring has sprung already? Huh? It's not even half-past winter. I set the wakeup ding-ding for April. Oh, well. What do you say? Let's hit the hay. [YAWNS] I'm with you, Yogi. Hey, hey, hey, you, outside with the drum, uh, beat it. There's no drummer outside, Yogi. The thumping is coming from up there. -Are you sure? -Sure, I'm sure. Listen for yourself. [SINGING FROM ABOVE] BOO BOO: You hear that? It's music. Let's go have a peekaboo, Boo Boo. But, Yogi, the ranger wouldn't like it. Do you know that aggravating a hibernating bear is illegal? I didn't know that. Neither did I. I just made it up. Hey, hey, hey! Follow me, Boo Boo. ALL [SINGING]: Coming up Christmas time [GRUMBLES] Without help, this is impossible. The music's getting louder, Yogi. [SNIFFING] The Yogi radar-nose has zeroed in on food. Straight up. I must talk to the hotel manager. Hey, hey, hey, pinch me, Boo. I'm going into a coma from that tantalizing aroma. Hey, hey, hey, looks like we hit the jackpot. Yogi, we're in somebody's kitchen. What better place to be, little bear-type buddy? Yummy yummy yum. Raspberry jam to go with the ham. CHEF: Ah-ha! So there you are. Uh-oh! Caught red-handed. What kept you? Put these on. Quickly, quickly. What are they, Yogi? Uh, I think-- I think they're prison-type clothes, Boo Boo. I am Otto, the chef. You waiters will help me prepare the food. Uh, yes, sir, Mr. Otto. I know all about food. Ah-ha! What is your specialty? Well, sir, I got no specialty. You might say I'm, uh-- I'm an expert on picnic baskets. In the winter, we do not fix picnic baskets. Follow me. These recipes require little bits of hard-boiled egg. You, chop an egg. YOGI: Yes, sir. Yes, sir, sir. One chopped egg coming up. Choppity-chop-chop. Ach! You obviously have never studied the art of cuisine. As a matter of fact, I haven't, sir. Uh, was this Cuisine fellow a good artist? Dunderhead, lamebrain, out of my kitchen. The guests inside are waiting for their dessert. Pass these out. Okay, sir. One for you, one for Boo Boo, and one for yours truly, namely me. No, no. Serve these to the guests outside. Ah, yes, sir, chief. I mean chef. I mean chef. I mean-- Oh, boy. Here you are, sir. A tasty pastry on the house. Yogi? It couldn't be. Yogi's fast asleep in his cave. Ha-ha-ha. Where else would he be? Gee, dear, old Dad, I can't wait for the big Christmas Eve party. [CHUCKLING] That goes for all of us, Augie. To be sure. To be sure. It'd be lots more fun if Yogi was around. YOGI: Did I hear my name? Yogi, is that really you? The one and only, at your service. Hey, Yogi, aren't you supposed to be fast asleep in your cave? I was. But a musical-type disturbance woke Boo Boo and me. Hey, hey, hey, what's this? Do trees go indoors in the wintertime? Yogi, that's a Christmas tree. You mean I woke up in time for Christmas? HUCKLEBERRY: That's right. -Sure did. In that case, I'm gonna stay awake. I've always slept through Christmas. Gee, dear, old Dad, this is gonna be Yogi's first Christmas. Yogi Bear is having his first Christmas. Lucky him, he didn't hibernate. [SINGING] He'll finally get to see -His first real Christmas tree -With popcorn strings -And sparkling things -That he helped decorate ALL: It's your first real Christmas, Yogi Bear DOGGIE: Have a good one, Yogi. AUGIE: We're gonna have fun, Yogi. ALL: He's never hung a stocking up before Never put a wreath on his front door He didn't know a kiss below A little sprig of mistletoe Was something Cindy Bear Was waiting for BOO BOO: He didn't know That Rudolph's nose was red DOGGIE: That Santa comes When you're asleep in bed ALL: A carol is something someone sings It's not a date that someone brings But Yogi Bear is not a knucklehead He's smarter so he says Than the average bear Modesty is not his game A bear like that is very rare I know the reindeer names That pull the sleigh Mistletoe is a kissing game you play ALL: That Santa takes the chimney route And all that giving's all about I'll not hibernate my holiday away ALL: It's your first real Yuletide Christmas Yogi Bear Have a happy Yule. BOO BOO: Merry Christmas, Yogi. Fellas, a terrific-type holiday like that deserves three cheers. -Hip, hip. ALL: Hooray! YOGI: Hip, hip. ALL: Hooray! Ranger, the guests are cheering someone. YOGI: Hip, hip. ALL: Hooray! So they are. Hooray for Christmas. What a terrific-type season for staying awake. See you around, fellas. Is that the voice of Yogi Bear? Please, Mr. Dingwell, don't ask me that question. All I asked was-- I said, don't ask me that question. Ranger Smith, Mrs. Throckmorton will be arriving momentarily. You have a sworn duty to perform. You're right, Mr. Dingwell. It's my duty to get Yogi back to his cave. And I will. [MIMICS BUGLE CALL] Charge. Uh-oh. Isn't that the ranger? I kind of think it is, Boo. Like I told you, Yogi, he's gonna make us go back to our cave. And miss our first Christmas? -No way, Boo Boo. Come on. -Where? YOGI: If Santa Claus can do this going down, we can do it going up. All right, Yogi, I've got you cornered. Yogi? Yogi? Yogi? [SNEEZING] [GROANS] It just isn't fair. This Yogi Bear assignment is above and beyond the call of duty. How will we get to the ground, Yogi? No problem, little buddy. There's a big high snowdrift down there. I'll just park it here until after lunch. Hey. Oof! Oh. This isn't a snowdrift, this is a snowplow. -Ah, so it is, Boo Boo. -Ah-ha! And we're gonna "ah-ha" our way out of here. One of these thingama-type bobs must be the starter. Oh, my. They took my snowplow. Don't worry, Mr. Dingwell. I'll stop them. Yow! Mr. Dingwell? Sir, where are you? Mr. Dingwell? DINGWELL: You're standing on my back again. Oh. Ah, heh, heh. Sorry. Swallow that blowplow. Uh, follow up that plowsnow. Don't worry, sir, I'll get them. Oh! They won't get away. They're gaing on us, Yogi. We could move faster, Boo... ...if I could just get this plow off the ground. You did it. Hooray! Hey, Boo, this is no time for cheering... ...because right now, I can't see where I'm steering. Oh! They did it again. Hang on, Mr. Dingwell. Oh, this is not my day. Not to worry, Mr. Dingwell. I'll have that bear back in his cave before Mrs. Throckmorton arrives. THROCKMORTON: We'll soon be there, Snively. You're going to love the Jellystone Lodge. I hate it already. And so do you, Aunt Sophie. That's why you wanna sell it. That's not true. I'm selling it purely for business reasons. SNIVELY: I wanna go home. THROCKMORTON: Now, now, don't be like that. They tell me Christmas carnival week is loads of fun. I hate Christmas. And I hate carnivals. They're boring. THROCKMORTON: Oh, come now. Ice skating, bobsledding, skiing. And a big tree-trimming party on Christmas Eve. Boring. We'll see. I can't believe it. More of them Christmas dudes are coming. Gah! Not if I can help it. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. He did it again. Good gracious, Yogi's driving over that embankment. BOO BOO: Careful, Yogi. There are some sharp turns up ahead. I know that, Boo Boo. What I don't know is how to stop this thing. Yippadee-doodle! THROCKMORTON: Oh, dear. The road is icy. We're stuck, Snively. Look, Aunt Sophie. THROCKMORTON: An avalanche. SNIVELY: Move the car. It's gonna fall on us. Oh, dear. It won't budge. BOO BOO: Yogi, we're gonna run into that car. I know, Boo, but I can't find the thingamajig to stop this thing. Hang on. Ugh! The car got through. Ding dang those pesky bears. Ah, Mrs. Throckmorton, welcome to the Jellystone Winter Lodge. Thank you, Otto. Where is Mr. Dingwell? There he is, ma'am. Coming up the road, lickety-split. Howdy, ranger. Uh, been enjoying the, uh, winter sports? Uh-- Egh-- Yogi, you-- You-- Ranger, look. She's here. Oh, Mrs. Throckmorton, please accept my apologies. -For what? -For these two clumsy waiters. These two clumsy waiters are heroes. They rescued us from an avalanche. Uh, we did, Yogi? I guess we did, Boo, uh, if the lady says so. Mr. Dingwell, I congratulate you for hiring such courageous... ...quick-thinking hotel workers. That's us, Boo Boo. I think they deserve a promotion. A promotion? Uh, uh, of course, of course. I'll, uh-- I'll promote them to, uh-- Let me think. We need bellhops. DINGWELL: Oh, yes. I'll promote them to bellhops. [SNORING] Don't fall asleep, Yogi. You've just been promoted... -...for being alert and wide awake. -Huh? You two will assume the duties of neat, natty bellboys. Bellboys? That means I'll be around for my first Christmas. And I've got a hunch it'll be my last. All right. All right, bellhops. Your first duty is to bring in Mrs. Throckmorton's luggage. -No, no. Don't let Yogi touch those bags. -Wha--? What? -Uh-- Uh, he deserves a rest. -But-- I'll bring in the luggage. DINGWELL: Oh, yes. Come inside. I'll give you your bellhop uniforms. Yogi, I want to thank you for your help. Don't mention it, Mrs. Throckmorton. Help is what I'm good at. And to prove it, I will now go to the kitchen and help myself to a few goodies. Let's go, Boo Boo. -My, what a charming bear. -Yuck! Charming bear? Now I can't make Yogi go back to his cave. But I'll be around. He'd better behave. Front. Front. Ohh! Where are those bellhops? [SNORING] Yogi, what was that? What was what, little buddy? -Didn't you hear something? -No. I was just laying here, dreaming about Santa Claus. Gee, I hope he'll come tonight. I hope so too, Boo Boo. Yeah, we both hope. [SINGING] Hope is waking Christmas dawn Knowing Santa's been and gone Hope can make our wish come true Maybe fill our stocking too Hope is knowing what will be Underneath the Christmas tree Hope is when your laughter rings Hope is sharing things Hope brings cheer And Santa's sleigh bells ringing Hope can hear The voice of angels singing Hope is like a dream you make It's a dream when you're awake Everyone needs hope Because hope believes in Santa Claus [RINGING] We gotta have hope. Hi there, Yogi. Hey, wake up. Mr. Dingwell is a-calling you. Heavens to Murgatroyd. Every time I turn around, Yogi is doing a slumber number. I know how to wake him, Snag. Now just stand back. Hey, hey, hey. Come one, come all. We are giving away free picnic baskets. Hey, hey, hey. Did I hear the magic words? Yum, yum, yum, yum, yummie. What you heard is the magic bell. The Dingwell bell. So exit, stage left. You keep sleeping on the job, Yog, you won't make it through Christmas. Hey, hey, hey, save a slice of Christmas cake... ...because Yogi Bear is wide awake. Here I am, Mr. Ding-A-Ling, sir. Yogi Bell-bear at your service. Well, about time. Take this paper into my office and read it over the loudspeaker. Ah, yes, sir, sir. [BLOWING] Uh, testing, one, two, three, four. Testing. A-tisket a-tasket, I want a picnic basket. Read the announcement. Yes, sir. Attention, please. All those who wish to participate in the figure-skating contest... ...please report to the ice-skating pond at the riverbank in one hour. Come on, dear, old Dad, let's get our skates. YOGI: The contest will be judged by Mrs. Sophie Throckmorton. Hey, hey, hey. And this is your DJ, Yogi Bear... ...who right now is going off the air. In one hour? Hmm. I'll teach these city dudes... ...to let Herman the Hermit have a little peace. [LAUGHING] Figure skating, eh? Well, here's something those Christmas dudes didn't figure on. Salt. This stuff makes ice melt. By the time the contest starts, this ice will be slush. YOGI: Right this way, Boo Boo. We've got an important-type job to do. Ding bust it. Someone's coming. Oh, it's those pesky bears. This is it, Boo. The ice-scraping machine. Uh, Yogi? You sure you know how to run this? Don't worry about a thing, Boo Boo. Mr. Ding-Dong gave me very complete-type instructions. Hang on. BOO BOO: Is this as fast as it'll go? [YAWNS] I'm afraid so, Boo Boo. Don't fall asleep. Oh, no. They're scraping away all the salt. There goes my ice-melting caper. Yogi, what's that mushy-looking stuff? It looks more like salt to me. So it does. The problem is, where to dump this stuff? BOO BOO: How about pushing it over the bank, Yogi? Good idea, little pal. Let's push-push the mush-mush. Yogi, I think slow is better. That does it, Boo Boo. A job well done. Uh, now we'll park it. Ooh, those ding-dang bears. YOGI [ON LOUDSPEAKER]: Attention, please. The figure-skating contest will begin in 10 minutes. This is your favorite DJ, Yogi Bear, saying: Stay cool and dig the Yule. Yeah. DINGWELL: Oh, Yogi. Uh, yes, sir, Mr. Ding-Ding? Bring a lunch tray up to the Throckmorton suite. A lunch tray? Hey, hey, hey, I'm on my way. Snively, are you sure you don't wanna enter the figure-skating contest? Huh! Some contest. You really think those clumsy clods can skate? Snively, try to remember, it's a contest for fun. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Answer the door please. Aw, gee whiz, Aunt Sophie. [KNOCKING CONTINUES] Yogi here with some Christmas cheer. Hey, watch it, you clown. Oh, please come in, won't you? Uh, here it is. One yummy-type lunch for young Snively. Yuck! Say, uh, little kid-type, aren't you entering the fun contest? Fun? Against those clumsy amateurs? Little Snively, you see, has taken lessons from professional skaters. Then the kid will win. Unless he's afraid one of the guests might be a better skater than he is. Oh, yeah? I'll show you, Aunt Sophie. I'll be there. I'll skate circles around those dum-dums. We'll see. Oh, you should listen to your aunt, Snivlee. She's a very smart-type lady. It's "Snively." And why don't you enter the contest, fuzz ball? Who knows about skating? Uh, I usually sleep through the winter. Here they are, Yogi. They're yours. Put them on, see if they fit. [YELLING] This is doing it the hard way. You have to get used to them. Wear them all day long, even while you're working. Whoops! Say, I guess it does take some, uh, getting used to. You're doing fine. Thanks a lot, Snive. You sure are a generous-type kid. [LAUGHING] The big nerd fell for it. [YELLING] I always say, nothing like a breath of air for a busy, hard-working bear. Snively, where are my ice skates? Gee, I don't know, Aunt Sophie. Hmm. That's strange. [STAMMERS] Your skates are missing? A brand-new pair. Could someone have sneaked into my room and taken them? Oh, no, Mrs. Throckmorton. Such things don't happen here at the Jellystone Lodge. He's right, ma'am. We know all these guests personally. Wait. Yogi was in our suite. Oh, come now, Snively. That nice Mr. Yogi wouldn't steal my skates. SMITH: I agree. I'll stay here and keep my eyes peeled for those skates. Oh, thank you, ranger. Come along, Snively. Hold it, Augie. Let me look at those skates. What's wrong, Mr. Ranger? Looking for stolen skates. -Next? -What is this? I never been so humiliated in my life. Thank you. Proceed. What's wrong, Mr. Ranger? Mrs. Throckmorton's skates are missing, that's what. Just a minute. Just a minute. How dare you imply that I would purloin or pilfer, even... ...the personal property of our praiseworthy patroness? Sorry, Snag. Only doing my duty. You're clean. Good luck in the contest. Luck has nothing to do with it. It's talent. Exit, stage right. Heavens to Hamill. Whoops! Sorry, fellas. Just a miscalculation, lack of coordination... ...and a slight goof, even. You're doing fine, Snag. Keep going. Doing fine? Ha! Hmm. I don't think Snagglepuss rates more than a 6.5. I agree. It looks as though my nephew will out-skate them all. Yes, indeed. Isn't that marvelous? No. I was hoping Snively would lose. It might shrink that swelled head of his. Where is Yogi? Last time I saw him, he took a lunch tray upstairs. A lunch tray and Yogi? That could mean double trouble. You mean Mrs. Throckmorton might sell this place? That's right, Boo Boo. Will you help me get Yogi back to the cave? Gee, Mr. Ranger, I'm sure Yogi won't cause any trouble. [CRASHING] Let's face it, a bear and skates don't mix. SMITH: "S. Throckmorton." -So you're the culprit. YOGI: No, sir. I'm not the culprit. I'm the bellhop. I don't even know what a culprit does. Off with those skates, Yogi. I'm taking you back to your cave. -Before Christmas? SMITH: Right now. Wait here. I'll get the snowmobile. Boo Boo, there is no way this bear is gonna miss Christmas. Where are you gonna go, Yogi? Out this window. Now you see me, now you don't. Tell him to come out, Boo Boo. He's already out, Mr. Ranger. Through the window. Ah-ha! A fugitive bear. Which way did he go? Never mind. I see him. He's heading toward the woods. Oh, why do they call these runners? They're terrible for running. Stop, Yogi, in the name of the Jellystone Parks and Recreation Commission. Uh-oh! It's the ranger, making like a bloodhound. Gee, dear, old Dad, Snively is a good skater. Good? Augie, that kid is absolutely superfluous. His performance deserves a 9.5. [STAMMERING] Yes. Yes, of course. A 9.5. Which will make Snively the winner. Ha, ha. It's like I told you, Aunt Sophie. I can skate circles around these dum-dums. Snively, try to be a good sport. SMITH: Yogi, stop, or it's the St. Louis Zoo for you. That there's the ranger's voice. And that's Yogi. Whoops! Aah! Yikes! -That's it, Yogi. End of the line. -Yikes, yikes! And another yipe! Oh, what a spin. A triple axel. Way to go, Yogi. Uh-oh. Uh, out here, I'm a sitting duck. Better get back to the woods. Whoops! Uh-oh. Another roadblock. [CHEERING] Masterful. [YAWNS] Yipee! Hooray for Yogi. Superb, splendiferous. Swell, even. A perfect 10. Yogi Bear is the winner. SNIVELY: He is not. I'm the winner. I'm the-- Who did that? Who did that? -Search me. -Ha, ha. That's my boy who did that. And I'm glad. Good effort, Snively. Runner-up isn't bad. Mrs. Throckmorton, before you present that to Yogi, I must inform you... ...those skates he's wearing are yours. THROCKMORTON: Ah. So they are. I wish I had never given him those skates. Then Yogi didn't steal them? No, Snively gave them to him. Congratulations, Yogi. This trophy is yours. Yow! [CRYING] What an athlete. What talent. What dumb luck. I should have won. Well, I'll beat him in the next event. Hello again. The Hot Dog Ski competition will begin in just 10 groovy little minutes. They're ready. Augie's coming down first. I blew it, dear, old Dad. That was a very clever stunt. Too bad about the fall. Doggie Daddy's next. Gonna do a exciting trick for us, Daddy? Are you kidding? I got a million of them. Here goes. [YELLING] Ooh. That's a long ways down. I'll, uh, heh, heh, hot dog it the easy way. [CRASH] Gee. Terrific stunt, dear, old daredevil Dad. I know for sure I can do better than that. You are all wasting your time. I'm gonna win this event. Here I go. Geronimo! Ah. I reckon they'll never call me Huckleberry Hot Dog. Oh, dear. I hope Snively doesn't win this event, for his sake. SMITH: Here comes Snagglepuss. Heavens to Baryshnikov, I did it again. Help. Ooh! That smarts. Oh, my. If this keeps up, nobody will win. THROCKMORTON: We'll have a winner all right. My nephew, Snively, unfortunately. Snively is next. Gee, Yogi, you didn't clamp your ski binding. -I didn't? SNIVELY: No. I'll do it for you. There. Now your skis won't fall off. I thank you, Snively. And good luck on your jump. Good luck to you, Yogi. Ha-ha-ha! You're the one who'll need it. Oh, what a nice kid. Guess I showed those amateurs how to hot dog. You were right, Mrs. Throckmorton. Snively is the winner. It's not over yet. Mrs. Throckmorton, Yogi hasn't a chance. He's never been on skis in his life. [HUMMING] SMITH: Here he comes. Yipe! No skis. I better go back. Hey, I'm not making headway. Whoops! Hey, hey, hey, skis, take it from a bear. Thanks for being here. Winner of the Hot Dog Ski Contest is Yogi Bear. Oh, congratulations again, Yogi. Yuck! Well, Mrs. Throckmorton, are you pleased with the Christmas carnival so far? Oh, yes, Mr. Dingwell, very pleased. Except for one thing. Uh, yes? Why have you got Yogi working as a bellhop? [STAMMERS] But you said-- Never mind what I said. He should be a ski instructor. A ski instructor? Yogi? Of course. An excellent suggestion, Mrs. Throckmorton. I'll promote him immediately. Yogi giving ski lessons? Oh. I better alert the first-aid station. Hi, Boo Boo. Boy, oh, boy. You missed all the excitement. Is it over? Who won the Hot Dog Ski Contest? "Who won?" he says. What a question. What a query. Why, Yogi, of course. Yogi? Uh, wait a minute. Yogi who? Silly bear. Your roommate, Yogi Bear. YOGI: Did I hear my name? Hey, hey, meet your new ski instructor. Well, grind my grits, Yogi. You look like a real ski instructor. Couldn't be any realer. Mr. Ding-A-Ling told me to start giving lessons tomorrow morning at 10 a.m. We'll be there, won't we, dear, old Dad? That's right, Augie. A professional ski instructor. Gee, Yogi, you're really going places. Right you are, Boo Boo. I don't like to boast, but, uh, I am the bear with the most. And successful, even. CHORUS [SINGING]: Yogi is the star In Jellystone Park The bear that makes it go, go, go Yogi is the wheel That's making the deal The executive producer of the show HUCKLEBERRY: He is the top BOO BOO: He is the toast SNAGGLEPUSS: He is the most DOGGIE: And can he boast CHORUS: I tell you, Yogi is the star In Jellystone Park The bear the makes the whole thing go He is depend-iest Terrific-al Colossiest Magnifical The bear that makes the whole thing go YOGI [SINGING]: It's about that time That time of the year again Sleigh bells ring That season is here again Mrs. Throckmorton, I promoted Yogi to ski instructor... ...just as you requested. Very good, Mr. Dingwell. Now, someone should rehearse the Christmas carol singers. Of course. Absolutely. Why didn't I think of that? Oh, that voice. I think Yogi sings very well. Uh, that's what I mean. I like it, I like it. Ha-ha-ha. Let Yogi lead the Christmas carolers. Yes, yes, brilliant suggestion. I'll arrange it immediately. [YOGI HUMMING] Oof. Better get up, Yogi. The ranger wouldn't like it. I tell you, Boo Boo, skiing is a dangerous sport. They're gonna sing Christmas songs at the party. Mr. Dingwell wants you to lead. Me? Ah, ha, ha, lead the singing? They sure picked the perfect bear-a-tone in Jellystone Park. I don't wanna sing those corny, old carols. Oh, Snively, where's your Christmas spirit? I don't have any. And I won't sing with those dum-dums. Christmas carols, tree-trimming party. Big deal. Phooey. That boy. Ooh. The singing group is here, Mrs. Throckmorton. Shall we start the rehearsal? I'm in no mood for singing... ...but we may as well. Isn't she enjoying herself? She told me she's in no mood for singing. And Yogi is leading the rehearsal. All right, group. And a one and a two. ALL [SINGING]: Deck the halls with boughs of holly Fa-la-la-la-la La-la la-la 'Tis the season to be jolly Fa-la-la-la-la La-la la-la Don we now our gay apparel Oh, cut. Stop. It sounds terrible. Your voices are drowning out my soprano. We need more girl voices. Without more girl voices, the carols won't sound right. Uh-oh. THROCKMORTON: It'll spoil the Christmas party. There goes the Jellystone Lodge. Maybe not, Mr. Ranger. Boo Boo, where are you going? Now what's he up to? Now, Mrs. T, you're absitively, posolutely right. -And I've got the solution. -What? I'll join you in the libretto with my female-type falsetto. Well, let's hear what it sounds like. And a-one, and a-two. ALL [SINGING]: Deck the halls with boughs of holly Fa-la-la-la-la La-la la-la 'Tis the season to be jolly Fa-la-la-la-la La-la la-la Don we now our gay apparel Fa-la-la la-la-la La-la-la Troll the ancient Yuletide carol Fa-la-la-la-la La-la la-la Cindy? Cindy Bear, wake up. Cindy, it's Boo Boo. CINDY: Boo Boo? Just a minute. Cindy, I gotta talk to you. Okay, okay. What's wrong? -A singing chorus? -Please, Cindy. I'm sorry, Boo Boo. It's only December. I need my beauty sleep. Okay, Cindy. Oh, poor Yogi. Yogi? What about Yogi? Well, he might lose his job. He's the leader of the singers. Why didn't you say so before? ALL [SINGING]: Deck the halls with boughs of holly Fa-la-la-la-la La-la la-la 'Tis the season to be jolly She's happy. She's happy. Good thinking, Boo Boo. Fa-la-la-la-la. Bah! I hate those goody-goody carols. I'll fix that yowling or my name isn't Herman the Hermit. ALL: Fa-la-la-la-la La-la la-la Hey, hey, hey. Congratulations, group. I'd say that was kind of nifty. Yogi, my boy, ain't it time for you to give us a ski lesson? It certainly is. If you wanna ski, leave it to me. Hey, hey, hey. You go ahead. I'll jump into my ski suit. I can't ski, Yogi. I'll just stay here. And do what? And wait for you, Yogi. Oh, yeah? Uh, well, uh, thanks for helping out, Cindy. There's a much better way to thank me, Yogi. Uh, listen, the gang's waiting for me. See you later, Cindy. Ooh, that Yogi. All right, students, pay attention. I'm gonna teach you how to ski right up that hill. Heavens to Murgatroyd. That's illogical, impossible and difficult, even. Yogi, we're supposed to ski that way, not that way. Whoops! Ha, ha. Uh, sorry. I forgot that I'm, uh, you know, teaching beginners. So we'll start the easy way, downhill. Here we are, Mrs. Throckmorton. I hope I haven't missed much of Yogi's lesson. You haven't missed anything, believe me. I'll turn on the motor. Thank you, ranger. This harmless smoke pot will throw a scare into those Christmas dudes. [LAUGHING] That should do it. Now to make my next move. Enjoy your skiing, Mrs. Throckmorton. Good grief, a forest fire. And now for my next move. I'll pull the plug on this silly ski lift. Oh, my, something's wrong... ...but I'm sure the ranger will fix the motor. Where is that ranger? Yoo-hoo! Mr. Ranger? Well, I doused that smoke pot. Someone's idea of a joke. Couldn't have been Yogi. He's up there giving a ski lesson. Hmm. Snively? I wonder.... THROCKMORTON: Yoo-hoo! Mr. Ranger? SMITH: Mrs. Throckmorton. Oh, no, the chairs have stopped. Sit tight, ma'am. I'll have you out of there in a jiffy. Something must have happened to the motor. I gotta do something fast or the lodge is a goner. [SHUDDERS] What am I doing up here? I should have stayed in the city. Mrs. Throckmorton? Don't worry about a thing, ma'am. I'll get you down safely. Well, I should hope so. This is standard procedure, never fails. What am I expected to do, slide down the rope? I'm coming up to get you. Have no fear. I'm a trained expert. I'll be there in one minute. Now then, students, these are called skis. And we, uh, use them on this white stuff, which is called snow. That's it, folks. Stop the lesson. This is mortifying. Yogi, we know all that. Yeah, Yogi. Um, why don't you teach us how to schuss? Schuss? Oh, uh, schussing's easy. It goes like this: -Shh. -Huh? Well, either that or just yell, "Quiet, please." Very droll, very droll. Now let's get down to the nitty-gritty. Okay, sir. Now this is a nitty and this is the gritty. Heavens to Murgatroyd. See how simple it is, ma'am? Why, ranger, how clever. I must congratulate you. Thank you, ma'am. Oh, dear me. Mr. Instructor-Yogi, what does "slalom" mean? Well, uh, little student-type buddy... ...a slalom is, uh, short for slalami. Ha, ha. Which is delicious with rye bread and mustard. Just a minute. Just a minute. It's oblivious and clear, even... ...that our instructor knows zip, zilch, and nothing, even, about skiing. Right you are, Snag. So why don't we all just ski down the hill, freestyle? BOO BOO: Yeah, sure. That'd be fun. DOGGIE: That's a good idea. Okay, chums. Exit, stage down. YOGI: OUh-oh. Too fast. Where's the brakes? [YELLS] Help. And another help. Phew. Saved by the cables. Uh-oh. I spoke too soon. Gang way. I can't stop. That's Yogi. He's coming to the rescue. Uh, how do you do, ma'am? I hope you're enjoying the ride. How about that? Yogi did it. Fantastical, miraculous. Good, even. I can't believe it. Everything's all right now. Thanks to Yogi. You've saved me again. I wanna thank Yogi personally. He won't hear you, ma'am. He's fast asleep. Oh, poor thing. He wore himself out rescuing me. Ma'am, that's not the reason he's sleepy. Never mind. Take him to the lodge and put him to bed. SMITH: Yes, ma'am. Thanks for the rescue, Yogi. I'm glad now that I didn't take you back to your cave... ...which is where a hibernating bear really belongs. Anyone for cross-country skiing? DOGGIE: Yeah, that's a good idea. AUGIE: Yeah, that's for me. We'll ski through Jellystone Park. Mush. BOO BOO: Oh, golly, Cindy, that's a cute hat. -You really like it, Boo Boo? -Yeah. Where'd you get it? Mr. Dingwell gave me a job. I'm a waitress. Uh, stand right here, Cindy. I'll be right back. Huh? What's going on? [GIGGLING] This. Oh, what was that for? It's mistletoe. It's a Christmas tradition, Cindy. You can kiss anyone who's under the mistletoe. -Anyone? -Yes. Mr. Dingwell told me and Mr. Ranger and Otto, the chef. Oh, Boo Boo. I'm so grateful to you. Uh, why? I'll tell you why, Boo Boo, when I find Yogi. [SINGING] I'm bashful, coy and timid I can't help acting shy I'm diffident, self-conscious No matter how I try I'm so demure I'm skittish I just can't tell you why But the guy who invented mistletoe Is smarter than the average guy Show me a sprig of mistletoe That Yogi Bear will stand below And I'll show you a gal that isn't shy Give me a sprig of mistletoe And when I turn those lights down low Watch out I'm gonna give it one more try Beneath that sprig of mistletoe I'm not too sure how far I'll go But one thing's sure I'm out to get that guy I'll cuddle close, he'll hold me tight Those kisses will be out of sight I'll probably die But what a way to go, yeah I really dig a sprig Just a teeny-weeny twig I really dig a sprig of mistletoe Hey, hey, who was banging on the drum? Come here, Yogi. Uh, later, Cindy. I wanna go back to the sack. Oh, please, Yogi. You can sleep later. There's something I wanna show you. -Uh, where? -Right over there. -Come with me. -What is it? Ooh, heh. It's a surprise. Something you're gonna like a lot. I hope. Hey, hey, hey, what's this? You were right, Cindy, old girl. This is my kind of surprise. Oh, Yogi. That's not the surprise I meant. Well, don't feel blue. Until I'm through, this one will do. Ooh! I'll get him under the mistletoe somehow. So this is the famous geyser. It shoots water up in the sky, about 400 feet up. THROCKMORTON: Why do they call it Old Faithful? Because it's one of nature's unpredictable wonders. Yeah, like Yogi. [CHUCKLING] [RUMBLING] -What's that? -It's getting ready to spout. How do you like that? What a coinkydinky. -Are we safe here? DOGGIE: Nothing to worry about, lady... ...long as we're behind this fence. HUCKLEBERRY: Well, there she blows. Oh! Astonishing. What power. What force. It's breathtaking. Indeed it is. Summer and winter... ...tourists come from all over just to see this phenomenanom. Phenomenomenonana. This geyser, even. Uh-huh. And they all check in to the Jellystone Lodge. Uh, Mrs. Throckmorton's Jellystone Lodge. Look, I know how you all feel about the lodge... ...and I can understand why, but I really must sell it. Aw, gee. Why, Mrs. Throckmorton? -For business reasons, Augie. -Gosh. Augie, if the lady says she must, then she must. There. Now Yogi can't walk anywhere through this lobby... ...without having to kiss me. Hey, hey, hey, what's this? What are you doing in high places? Oh, Yogi. You're just in time. -In time for what? -Yogi, look up. Say, uh, what's that stuff growing out of the ceiling? It's mistletoe, Yogi. -And I'm standing under it. -So? That means you can kiss me if you want to... ...or I can kiss you. Huh? Uh. -How come? -Because you're standing under it too. -Are you sure? -She's right, Yogi. It's an old Christmas tradition. Uh, listen, Cindy, uh.... Oh, I'm late. I gotta check the bobsled. Yogi Bear, come right back here. You owe me a kiss. Where is he? He won't get away this time. Yogi Bear, where's your Christmas spirit? Uh-oh! Here she comes. I gotta find-- I gotta find a hiding place. Ah-ha! That's it. Another brilliant Yogi move. I'm safe now. Hey, what's this? I'm moving. Yipe! Help! Boo Boo, Mr. Ranger... ...somebody! [GROWLING] Oh, my goodness. What's that? AUGIE: A snow monster. He's real mad. Maybe he's trying to communicate. What a nasty predicament. Just a minute. Just a minute. I'll handle this blustering Bigfoot. Now, listen here. How dare you intimidate or interlock us or trepidate us, even? Huh? I am a genuine, bona fide lion. King of the jungle. I'll have you know I'm fearless. [ROARING] Well, since you put it that way... ...help! Run for your lives. Exit, stage left. Oh, dear. Here comes the monster. [GROWLING] [YELLING] Arr-- Huh? Aah! THROCKMORTON: Mr. Dingwell, I have a bone to pick with you. Oh, yes, Mrs. Throckmorton? Yogi Bear rescued me today, not once, but twice. Why is he only a ski instructor? But, Mrs. Throckmorton, you told me-- -Must you do everything I tell you? -No, ma'am. Good. Then do what I tell you. Promote Yogi to chief of security. Excuse me, ma'am. I'm in charge of security. Of course, you are, ranger, in the park. But on my property, Yogi is chief of security. Yogi? Oh.. I think I'll go to his cave and sleep through the winter. Chief of security, huh? That old fuzz ball. I'll keep him hopping. [LAUGHING] Hey, hey, as chief of security... ...it's my job to prevent people from stealing things. Even kisses from me. And so this mistletoe has gotta go. Got you. YOGI [ON LOUDSPEAKER]: Hey, hey, hey, attention please. This is your new security chief, Yogi Bear, with a special announcement. The hotel bus will leave in 10 minutes... ...for the ice fishing contest on Jellystone Lake. Thank you and merci beaucoup. Ice fishing? Gee. Who'd wanna catch a piece of ice? Aunt Sophie, I'm not gonna go to that old ice-fishing contest. Of course not, Snively. It's very cold on that lake. I'm glad you'd rather stay here. Huh? In that case, I wanna go. Very well, then, go. I'm staying here. Mm, yummy, yum-yum. Uh, when do we cook them up and eat them, Mr. Ding-Dong? After the judging, Yogi. What's to judge? I'm the champ. That's what you think, Snively. I'm the champ. My fish is longer. That's not a fish. It's an eel. Hmm. Snively has a good point. Hey, hey, hey, you're wrong, kiddo. Rule book says, "An eel is a fish." Oh, well, keep trying, Snively. You may still win. You're all against me. [DOGGIE SHUDDERS] I'm freezing. These old bones could stand a bit of warming up. So the champ wants to warm up, huh? Hmm. This hut has no floor and there's an ice hole nobody's using. No. No, no, no. It wouldn't be right for the chief of security to steal a fish. Uh-oh. The fishing hut. Hey. Help. You did that on purpose. Wahh! Take me back to the hotel. I'm gonna tell my Aunt Sophie on you. [CRYING] Gee, fellas, I didn't know the kid was back there. Makes no never mind, Yogi. If Mrs. Throckmorton gets mad about this... ...she's sure as shooting gonna sell the hotel. Snively, what happened to you? It was that mean, old Yogi. He pushed me into the icy water for no reason at all. That's right, put the blame on me, Mrs. T. -You came to apologize? -Uh, no, sir, ma'am, I did not. And I'm not a bit sorry because this kid deserved it. He's lying, Aunt Sophie. THROCKMORTON: What did he do wrong, Yogi? Uh, madam, I'm a bear, not a snitch-cat. I wanna thank you, Yogi. It's about time someone taught Snively a lesson. Hey, Aunt Sophie.. THROCKMORTON: Now, perhaps he'll stop acting like a spoiled brat. Huh? You'll be sorry, Aunt Sophie. And so will you, you old fuzz ball. -Ow! Oh, oh! -You'll see. You'll see. Gee, maybe I ought to have apologized. No, he'll be a better boy for it, thanks to you, Yogi. How can she treat her own favorite nephew like this? Well, I'll get even. I'll spoil their dumb, old Christmas holiday. I'll give her something to worry about... ...like a missing nephew, that's what. I'll run away, for days maybe. She'll think I'm lost. Ha-ha-ha! Now, let's see.... Where am I? I really am lost. I don't know the way back. Hello? Anybody around? Hey, can anyone hear me? I'm lost. Help me. Maybe I shouldn't have been such a mean little kid. Oh, no, I'm sealed in. Nobody knows I'm here. I gotta get out of here. I still don't know where I am. Better keep moving. "Herman the Hermit." Maybe he can give me directions. Hi. Anybody home? He's not here. I'll wait for him to come back. But I'm so tired. I could sleep on anything. Oh, there you are, Mr. Dingwell. Does anyone know where Snively is? I saw him through my window, skiing down the mountain this morning. So that's it. He ran away just to spite me. Oh, this is bad. He could be lost out there in the wilderness. Don't you worry, Mrs. Throckmorton. We'll form a search party. Mr. Ranger, nobody knows Jellystone Park better than Yogi. That's true. Yogi is familiar with every nook and cranny. They're right, ranger. And Yogi is the chief of security. Well, okay. Yogi, we need you. Snively ran away. He could be lost out there. Lost? Well, as security-type chief around here, I will form a search party. I've already done that, Yogi. I'll search from the air, in my helicopter. And, uh, I'll lead the ground party? Correct. You and the others will spread out over the area and reconnoiter. -Reek-a-what-a? -Reconnoiter. Search through the park. Oh, yes, sir, yes, sir, Mr. Ranger. And, sir, nice to have you on my team. Oh, boy. Don't worry about a thing, sir. Me and the gang will reek the best connoiter you ever saw. [CHUCKLES] YOGI: Now hear this. There's a boy out there with a cold nose and cold toes... ...and where he is, nobody knows. So here goes. Wagon, ho. Those ding-dang Christmas dudes. Can't stand having them around. Dang, bang, ding bust it. He's one of them. Hey, you. Wake up. You got no right breaking into my cave. You're with that Christmas bunch, ain't you? Not me, mister. I can't stand them. I'm fed up with you nervy, noisy, nosy Christmas tourists. And your cockamamie Christmas carnivals. -Them contests are stupid. -Boy, are they ever. All that screaming and hollering and singing them namby-pamby Christmas songs. Yeah. Really dumb songs. Christmas. Bah! All that nonsense about Santa Claus. Yeah, kid stuff. I hate Christmas. And decorating trees with tinsel and ornaments and-- What did you say? I think Christmas is a rotten holiday. What's your name, boy? -Snively. -Ha. Nice name. You hungry, boy? Somewheres around here, I got a jug of pickled snails. Yuck! No, thanks. You know, Herman, you and me... ...we're on the same wavelength. Well, Snively, I'm glad to see that you hate Christmas too. And I wish for all them Christmas-loving dudes down there... ...a very miserable Christmas. [SINGING] Because I'm mean, sour, nasty and cruel I gets my pleasure as a general rule Out of scaring them folks With their carnival Yule [BOTH LAUGHING] [ROARS] I do it sneaky I operate a bit outside the law I'm the slyest, thorniest, downright orniest Hermit you ever saw I'm sour, bad, nasty and mean I'll ruin Christmas, scare Santa away Chase off them reindeer And burn up the sleigh Ha-ha-ha! We'll get them good, won't we, Snively? Right, you mean, old hermit. Bah! Humbug. Double humbug. BOTH [SINGING]: We're mean, sour, nasty and cruel We gets our pleasure as a general rule Out of scaring these dudes With their carnival Yule [BOTH LAUGHING] YOGI: Okay, platoon, this will be our command post. Now let's break out the search-type equipment and split up. Hey, hey, hey, what's this? Sleeping on duty? Hey, hey, you two. Rise and shine. Hit the deck. They can't help it. This is hibernating time for bears. Yeah, that's right. We should all be having our winter snooze. [YAWNS] Okay, we'll let them sleep. It's back to duty. All right, search party, you got your assignments. Now spread out and search for that poor, sweet, helpless, pesky, little brat. Gung ho. [SNORING] SMITH [OVER RADIO]: This is Ranger Smith calling Yogi Bear. Yogi, wake up. Yes, sir. Uh, where are you, sir? SMITH: Inside your walkie-talkie, that's where. Huh? Oh, I get it. You're in the chopper. I see no sign of Snively. Do you have anything to report? No, sir, Mr. Ranger, I have nothing to report. Except an accident. A Santa Claus costume? [LAUGHING] I swiped that during last year's Christmas carnival. Took it off a snowman. This one too. His elf. Hey, then you're the mysterious character who caused all the trouble last year. You bet, sonny boy. Herman, would you like to unravel this year's carnival too? I been trying, but this is the last day of the carnival. And the most important one. Everybody's looking forward to the big tree-trimming party tonight. Ah-ha! We steal the ornaments. Not we, Herman. Two other characters will steal them. [BOTH LAUGHING] Look, dear, old Dad, a reindeer. So it is, Augie, my boy, just like the kind that pulls Santa's sleigh. How do you like that? Someone tried to lasso that poor creature. Snively? Come on, dear, old Dad, let's get him. All right, Snively, come out of there. Ho, ho, ho! I've been called Santa, and St. Nick... ...but no one's ever called me Snively. Yeah, who is Snively? Gee, dear old flabbergasted Dad, it's Santa Claus and his helper. Ha-ha-ha. Will wonders never cease? What are you doing here in Jellystone, Santa? Ho, ho! Tonight is Christmas Eve, my big night. But wouldn't you know it... ...one of my reindeer came down with a bad cold... ...so me and my elf came here to find a replacement. Wow, in Jellystone Park. You know, Santa, old pal... ...we're throwing a party tonight at the Jellystone Lodge. Really? Well, ain't that nice? Long as you're in the neighborhood... ...you think you could spare a minute to drop in? Ho, ho! Yes, indeed, sir. We will definitely visit the lodge. Yeah. Ho, ho. Maybe sooner than you think. Oh, boy. Thanks. Come on, dear, old Dad, Santa's gonna catch a reindeer. See you tonight, Santa. Forget about the reindeer, Herman. We can pull this caper off without them. Let's go. Security Chief Yogi Bear to Ranger Smith. I read you, Yogi. Find anything? Yes, sir, sir. Ski tracks near the geyser. Could be Snively's. They lead right into the woods. I can't see into the woods from up here. You check it out. Yes, sir. Roger and wilco, over and out... ...10-4, end transmission, au revoir. SMITH: Will you get going? As you wish, sir. Gee, what a grouch. HERMAN: The hotel bus? This means a search party's looking for you, Snively. -That's bad. -No, that's good. The lodge is practically deserted. It'll make our caper that much easier. The woods must be crawling with searchers. Let's get moving. Wait. We'll give this dopey search party something else to search for. These two sleeping beauties. Ha, ha! Now let's get those ornaments. No, Mrs. Throckmorton, there's been no word from the search party. Mr. Dingwell? The Christmas ornaments, where shall I put them? By the fireplace, Otto. Under the tree. Wait till you see the wonderful dishes I am preparing for the party. Otto, with Mrs. Throckmorton's nephew lost out there in the wilderness... ...there'll be no party. It's unthinkable. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] They've returned. I hope it's good news. Huh? Santa Claus? Heh, heh. Not really, sir. We're the actors hired by Ranger Smith for the party. Oh? He didn't tell me. Well, it's supposed to be a surprise. Yeah. We came early to check out the chimney and the fireplace. Well, the party may be cancelled but, okay, no harm in checking it out. Excuse me, I have work to do. You go on the roof, Herman. I'll check the fireplace. Okay, Santa, drop it. Got it. Now, wait for my signal. Okay, Herman, up we go. I'll lower you and the crate down the back of the building. Hmm. Who's that on the roof of the lodge? Great Scott. It's Santa Claus and a little elf. Wait, the elf looks like-- Could it be? Yes, it's Snively Throckmorton. Ranger Smith to search party. Snively is no longer missing. He's back at the lodge. Call off the search. You may return. Hey, hey, hey, that makes my day. It's back to the chalet. -That's the ranger's copter. -Heading this way. Hold on, Snively. Can't see them from here. Oh, dear. They got away. Look, they're dragging the crate through the snow. Come on. My copter. They're flying off with it. DINGWELL: And with our special ornaments. I told you my plan would work. We'll hide this in your cave. [BOTH LAUGHING] Hey, hey, hey, what's this? The hotel bus sitting on the geyser? Cindy and Boo Boo are still in it. Could go off any time. I gotta get them out of there. Oh, oh, we're running out of gas. Yipe! Water's boiling underground. It's ready to spout. Cindy, wake up. We gotta drive this thing out of here. Herman, look down there. It's Yogi trying to drive the bus away. Fly closer, Herm. I wanna see this. This will be a barrel of fun if that geyser goes off. Gotta get going, fast. [YELLING] CINDY: Yogi, where are we? What's happening? Never mind, Cindy. Just hang on to Boo Boo. Herman, I see the bus, but where are those stupid bears? HERMAN: Ding dang it. This darn chopper is turning back. -Like it has a mind of its own. SNIVELY: Huh? Heavens to Ebenezer Scrooge. The tree-trimming party is canceled? Sorry, group. Snively and some unknown person in a Santa costume... ...stole all the ornaments. THROCKMORTON: Oh, that's Yogi and Cindy and Boo Boo. It's gonna crash. Scatter. Way to go, Yogi. Now, that's what I call a security officer. Lookie, dear, old Dad, the tree decorations are back. [CRYING] It was all his fault. He made me do it. A likely story. I'll deal with you later. Go to your room and stay there. Herman, eh? Well, that name will soon be changed to a number. You're under arrest. Ranger, must you? On Christmas Eve? What--? Oh, okay. Rangers have Christmas spirit too. You're free to go. -Attaboy, Mr. Ranger. -Good for you. That's right nice. Herman, you're welcome to attend our tree-trimming party tonight. Tree-trimming party. Bah! Santa Claus. Bah! I ain't one of your ding-dang Christmas tourists. Christmas carols, Christmas presents, Christmas spirit. Bah! All that fuss. Yogi, Cindy, Boo Boo, are you guys all right? -I'm okay. -Me too. Yogi? Uh-oh. Yogi, are you in there? Hey, hey. I was, uh, catching 40 winks in the hay, hay, hay. Yogi, my boy, your heroics today were absolutely magnitudinaminous. They certainly were. Yogi managed everything beautifully. Oh, yes, indeed. Speaking of managing... ...I think Yogi deserves another promotion, don't you? Why, yes, of course. But promote him to what? The next step is.... Hotel manager. Hotel manager. YOGI: Hey, hey, let's go. Time to start our tree-trimming party. It's Christmas Eve. Where is everybody? Front, front. Let's get some action here. If it's action you want, Yogi... ...I'm ready, willing and kissable. Uh, not now, Cindy. I'm ringing the bell for the hotel personnel. A waitress is hotel personnel. Yogi Bear, when am I gonna get that Christmas kiss? Cindy, uh, I gotta start the celebration which leaves no time for osculation. Ooh. -Excuses, excuses. -Gee. It ain't easy being a dreamboat. Front, front. -Bellboy Boo Boo reporting. -You rang, sir? Gee, Mr. Dingwell, when he rings the bell... ...he wants the bellboy, not the hotel manager. Boo Boo, that is no longer my position. Mrs. Throckmorton made Yogi the manager. And with good reason, Mr. Ding-Dong. I'm smarter than the average bear. Well, what do you want me to do, Mr. Manager? Go upstairs, little cub-type flunky, and knock on all the doors. -Yes, sir, Mr. Manager. YOGI: There's more. Tell all the guests to come downstairs for the party. Right, Yogi. I mean, Mr. Manager. And I? What do you wish of me? Mr. Ding-A-Ling, as my assistant... ...your assignment is to take charge of the desk for a few minutes. I'm gonna check on the, uh, party refreshments. That won't be necessary. I've already checked them out. Uh, you have? I just came from the kitchen, tasted all the refreshments. Everything's delicious. Delicious, huh? Well, uh-- Uh.... I'm sorry, Mr. Dingle-Dangle, but I can't take your word for it. As any first-class executive will tell you... ...if you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself. Set it on the floor, Boo Boo. Right here. Ugh. I can't lift it. It's too heavy. You're doing it all wrong. Lift the hand truck and let it slide off. Merry Christmas, y'all. Say, appears like we're the first guests. Dear me. How awkward, how gauche... ...embarrassing, even. [GRUNTS] Come now, Boo Boo, you can lift it if you try. Here, Boo, I'll do it for you. There you are. Lookie here, Snag, Mr. Dingwell's all lit up for Christmas. So he is, so he is. How clever, how original. How painful, even. The crate is on my feet. [SIGHS] HUCKLEBERRY: Poor Mr. Dingwell. I should say. That smarts. That ain't what I meant, Snag. Huck means Mr. Dingwell won't have any place to go... ...after Mrs. Throckmorton sells the lodge. Wow, it sure takes you a long time to get ready, Aunt Sophie. Why are you wearing those clothes? I've decided to go to the party, after all. Oh, you have? Yeah. I figure I'll get a few laughs watching those dum-dums act silly. Snively, any laughing you do tonight will be done right here. -No party for you. -Huh? You are restricted to your room. Hey, wait a minute. I'm gonna tell Mommy and Daddy that-- Knock it off, Snively. You did everything you could to spoil their Christmas carnival. I'm not going to let you spoil their party. See if I care. I didn't wanna go to your stupid, old party, anyway. [CRYING] Herman the Hermit. What are you doing here? -Get a blanket. -Huh? Why? We're gonna have our own little party, outside. Oh, wow! Terrific. And it won't have nothing to do with all that Christmas humbug. We don't need no Christmas tree nor no hoity-toity buffet dinner. I brung us a bag full of delicious grub from my cave. Come on. [SINGING] In a canyon, in a canyon Excavating for a mine Lived a miner, forty-niner Augie, my boy, I think now's the time to give you one of your Christmas presents. Oh, thanks, dear old considerate Dad. You are lost and gone forever Oh, my darling, Clementine Heavens to Murgatroyd. Shouldn't we be singing our Christmas carols? We will, Snag, when our leader shows up. Ma'am, perhaps I should go out and look for Yogi. Um, no need for that, Ranger. I'm sure Yogi will be here soon. Why don't we start trimming the tree?

Thanks, Herman. AUGIE: Mrs. Throckmorton? Where's Yogi and Boo Boo? THROCKMORTON: They'll be here any minute, Augie. Otto, slice the turkey. Dried catfish, Snively. Tastes like nothing you ever ate. Yuck! You're right. [CHATTERING] HUCKLEBERRY: It just don't seem right, Snag. Poor Yogi and Boo Boo. They're missing all the fun. [HORN HONKING] Heavens to Gabriel, who's blowing that horn? Somebody's trying to spoil the party. -I'll make them scat. -Stay back, Huckleberry. This is a job for the ranger. -Huh? -Oh! Ha, ha. Yogi, what's the meaning of this? I'll explain later, sir. Yeah, we have to park the bus. And we'll be at the party before you count three... ...so save some goodies for Boo Boo and me. Ma'am, who are these children? Relax, ranger. I sent for them. These dear, sweet children are orphans who have never had a Christmas vacation. Well, this year, they're going to have one... ...beginning with this party. Heh, heh. So that's where Yogi was. Yep. Driving the kids up from the city. THROCKMORTON: And now for my surprise announcement. I'm not going to sell the Jellystone Lodge. [ALL CHEERING] DINGWELL: That's wonderful. I'm going to donate the lodge... ...to the Jellystone Foundation, of which I am the president. It'll be used as a year-round vacation spot for orphans. And every winter, all of you will be invited back for the winter carnival. [CHEERING] Uh, ma'am? -We have a question to ask you. -Go ahead. Yes. Uh, well, uh, next year, uh, who will be the hotel manager? Why, you will, Mr. Dingwell. Oh, thank you. I'll start planning immediately for next year's carnival. No, no. That will be the job of our new permanent Christmas carnival director. -And that is? -Yogi Bear. -Yogi Bear. -Yogi Bear. [CHEERING] [YOGI YELLING] Oof! Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas. Look, children, it's Santa Claus. And his little helper. He came to bring you your Christmas presents. Heavens to Kris Kringle, that's not the real-- Hush up, Snag. Don't spoil it for the young'uns. Gee, dear, old Dad, how come Santa has a nose like a bear? Let's put it this way, Augie, my boy... ...that is not your average Santa Claus. Uh-oh. Ha, ha. I almost made a boo-boo. A boo-boo? And that's not your average elf. [BOTH CHUCKLING] Ho, ho, ho. What have we here? Now, uh, which one of you is Rosita? And who's Tommy? I'm still hungry. Boy, I wish I was at that party. No you don't, kid. You and me, we hate Christmas, right? Yeah. I guess so. Of course you do. And here's Santa's gift for little Augie Doggie. Let's see now, little elf-type buddy, uh, who didn't get a present? Oh, ho, ho, ho. There's somebody. HUCKLEBERRY: It's Herman the Hermit. AUGIE: And Snively. Snively? Where's Snively? -Outside, ma'am. -At the window. THROCKMORTON: I don't see him. He was there a moment ago with Herman. Ho, ho, ho! Hold everything. Old Santa found a couple of more customers. Merry Christmas, Snively. You too, Herman. Welcome to the party. You boys must be hungry. You-- You're not gonna punish me, Aunt Sophie? I may, Snively, if you don't eat everything on that plate. Happy Christmas to both of you. And here's a Christmas dinner for you, Herman. Ho, ho, ho! Bring those latecomers over here. Old Santa may have something for them. For--? For us? Maybe. Who knows? Here's one says, "Happy holiday to Snively." And this one says, "Merry Christmas to Herman." SNIVELY: He wasn't fooling, Herman Our names are on them. In spite of all we done, they bought Christmas gifts for us. Comes Christmas time, bygones is bygones. It's what you call Christmas spirit. You know something, Herman? They're not dum-dums. We are. I know. We had it all wrong. -We love Christmas. -We love Christmas. And Christmas loves you. Why? The answer's easy. Because Christmas loves everyone. ALL: Hooray for Christmas. Yogi? I mean, Santa? Uh, didn't you bring a present for Cindy? Please, it really doesn't matter. Cindy, huh? Well, how about that? "Happy Christmas to Cindy Bear." Oh, thank you. Oh! It's beautiful. ALL: Ah. Oh! Thank you, Santa. Ho, ho, ho! And that ain't all that goes with it. Cindy Bear, I hereby crown you Miss Jellystone Park. Oh! Ha. And here's something else that goes with it. [SINGING] All at once I've just decided That I'm very much excited I've been kissed I mean kissed by Yogi Bear My heart's more than just aflutter I can't speak for fear I'll stutter [STUTTERS] I've been kissed by that bear Why is it so That mistletoe is just for Christmas? Why can't it be a thing we use Throughout the year? Each day I could insist And properly be kissed Then cuddle close and purr in Yogi's ear Then I could kiss him every night Beneath the moonlight And I could kiss him When there isn't any moon I can't stand the thought of missing All that tender love and kissing That old custom's out of date Take it away Mistletoe, I'm going to use you everyday [SIGHS] What have I done? These lips are lethal weapons. [MAN YELLING] After all these years, I still don't have the hang of it. Ho, ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas, everyone. Well, well, what have we here? A jolly group. Just a moment. This, sir, is a private party. How dare you crash our bash? You want me to leave? Hey, hey, hey, let's not forget our Christmas-type spirit. The welcome mat is out for anyone who drops in. -Ho, ho. I certainly did. -I know what you mean, sir. There ought to be an easier way for us Santa Clauses. Say, we're wearing the same outfit. Uh, not exactically, stranger. If you will notice, my duds are the official, authentic Santa Claus costume. Oh? And mine isn't? Well, now, sir, uh, the overall effect ain't bad... ...but those boots, they're cut too low. Santa would never wear those. Oh. Yeah, I see. And, I might add, you put too much stuffing in your suit. The real Santa ain't that fat. -You don't say? -I do say. -Old Santa and I are close-type buddies. -Yogi. And, sir, I don't mean to offend you, but that fake beard? Is just too much. Hey, you got that glued on pretty tight. I realize that. And painfully. Yogi. What is it, little elf-type pal? -That's the real Santa Claus. -Huh? Uh-oh. I think you're right. Gee, whillikers, Santa, uh, I'm sorry. -Hope you're not sore. -Well, how could I be... ...when you've done all my work for me here? Huh? Oh, passing out all these Christmas presents to the children. This is my busy night. You've saved me a lot of time and work. Thank you, Yogi Claus. Well, my reindeer are waiting on the roof. Wait. I almost forgot. I have one Christmas gift in here that hasn't been delivered. And this one's for you, Yogi. Something you've always wanted. Look, Yogi, it's a picnic basket. Happy Christmas, Yogi Bear. Ho, ho, ho, ho! Take it, it's yours. Uh-oh. Oh, no. Not again. Yogi. Yogi, wake up. This'll do it, Boo Boo. I guess it won't. You see, Santa, this time of year, Yogi's supposed to be hibernating. When he wakes up in the spring, wish him a happy Christmas from me. Ho, ho, ho, ho! A merry Christmas to all and to all a good night. Group, Yogi Bear accomplished what he set out to do. He stayed awake through Christmas. [ALL CHEERING] And now it's my duty to return Yogi to his cave. Um, if you don't mind, Mr. Ranger, I'd like to go along with you. Me too. Can I, dear, old Dad? And why not? This looks like another act everybody wants to get into. Aunt Sophie? May I go too? And Herman? Certainly, Snively. And count me in. All right, everyone follow me and Ranger Smith. CHORUS [SINGING]: It's our favorite time of the year It's that magical time of good cheer I guess part of the reasons The heart of the seasons That Christmas is practically here Every shop window Up and down the boulevard Has the look Of a big expensive Christmas card There's a train load of trees At the railroad yard And one of these Soon will be ours Every roof wears a blanket of snow Every face wears a holiday glow All the world is feeling That mistletoe feeling That tells us Christmas is here It's our favorite time of the year Good night, Yogi. You're a dear, sweet bear. Ding dang it. I gotta go along with that. Yeah. Good night, you old fuzz ball. You're some terrific character. See you in the spring, Yogi. Sleep well and merry Christmas. [SNORING] And to all of you out there, a merry Christmas to you too. Ho, ho, ho. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
