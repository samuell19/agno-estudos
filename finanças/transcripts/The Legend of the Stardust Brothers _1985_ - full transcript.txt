Kan, wait.This is our big chance. - Nah. - Come on, think of the $500,000! Nope! - You dumbass idiot. - You stinkin' pig. Goddamnit! Hold on guys, I don't need to be a singer. Every star has a fan club. I'll be running their fan club. How about that? My honor to be the first fan. I'm in charge. I don't need you, but remember I've been a groupie for 7 years. The fans control the star's success. Are you sure? My chance has yet to come. Okay, let's do it! Come and sign the contract. Um...this is my original song. The lyrics are written in simple Japanese, and the B-side of the tape is the karaoke version. You are reborn today. Forget about all the past. You are brothers separated at birth. Brothers? Now you are reunited, your natural talent has awakened. Natural talent... Passed through your father's blood, he was a great musician. Father's blood? As of today, you are... Just hanging around without any purpose Ordinary life without fuss All I want is a car and a guitar Also love Just try to write a song (something satirical) Maybe play it somewhere Everyone comes up with a similar scenario Music to reach youth's hearts Various songs, various songs Only have one female friend In an average relationship Living alone in an urban city Healthy adolescence Just try to write a song (something trendy) Maybe I'll be famous Everyone comes up with a similar scenario Music to reach youth's hearts Various songs, various songs Music to reach the youth's hearts Various songs, various songs Music to reach youth's hearts Various songs, various songs I'm beat! I've got nothing left! Being famous is so exhausting, right? Hey, are you listening? - Shingo. - Yeah? Do you believe we can be stars? You kidding? We're already big stars! We've been on all sorts of media, and look, we've got hundreds of fan letters! When we go outside people go mad like, "Look at me, Shingo. I love you!" I know, but we're like two for one, right? One only is just dust. Dust, huh? You're right, I'm dust. I can't sing, I can't dance, I'm pretty lame. I know I wasn't good enough. Even though this may be a mistake surely we're on our way to stardom. There's no time to think. I might as well get to the top now. Yep, we're dust for now but not any dust, we're the dust of stars. Like those shiny stars in the sky. We're stardust! It's you again! Stop! I'm running the Stardust Brothers' fan club. Damn liar! You think you can fool me again? Just a second! Who's the hell are you? Oh, Mr. Kan & Mr. Shingo! Good morning, Sir. Shame on you bullying a lady. Yes, but this one is... She's what she says. I knew it! Well, but Sir...we weren't told about...ow! Shut your goddamn face! We're telling you now. Got it? Do you really wanna get fired? Now, get out of my face! - Yes, Sir! - Yes, Sir! - Thanks, Kan. - No worries. So, our fans are multiplying, eh? You two are unstoppable! Right, Shin? - Indeed! - You're being nice. Maybe we are! - Thanks to Marimo. - Yep! They're obsessed with you, I can't win. - You're special. - Yeah, you're a member of our team. I know! I'll ask Boss if you could debut as a singer. Yeah, you should be a singer. Thank you, guys! Though I'm not that interested. Why not? That was your dream, right? Well, I don't believe in my ability. That doesn't matter! Look at him, stupid, fat and ugly. And he's a star. Hey! You're goddamn horrible! - A metaphor. - Yeah, right! We might as well be super stars! Us three, all rich! Posing in front of a mirror Pumping up biceps Looking good, satisfied So what? Who cares?

You see? I'm special. I know, I'll write a song for you. I'll write my own songs from now on! A helicopter is flying Or maybe it could be a bee? Well, I couldn't care less Elevator is dead Or maybe it could be a snake? So? I can't be bothered Because... Because... I can't stop shaking This must be...a dream I can't stop crying This must be...a dream I can't stop laughing This must be...a dream An alligator is dancing Or maybe it could be a tiger? Well, I couldn't care less Producer is shouting at me He could be a bull So? I can't be bothered Because... Because...

Is he not here yet? You came alone? - Aren't you worried? - What? About Shingo... Lately he seems lonely. Only himself to blame, he's been drinking a lot. How do I look? Maybe he got scared and ran away.Wimp. Fine by me, he was a burden. I'll be just fine alone. After all, he wasn't a man of charisma, right? Got a call from my manager saying "What're you doing?" Then I woke up, The sun is yellow and dazzling So are your shiny green lips Got a call from my manager saying "Enough is enough." Then I jumped out of bed The sun is yellow and dazzling So are your shiny rainbow eyelashes Got some milk from the fridge It looked like tomato juice Oh no, this is just like yesterday Got a call from my manager saying "You're fired!" Then I got changed in a hurry The sun is yellow and dazzling Like a sunny side up in a blue sky Got some milk from the fridge It looked like tomato juice Oh no, this is just like yesterday Green lips, red milk The sun is yellow The sky is radiant blue You have to go on stage. They can't wait any longer. I'll go find Shingo. I can't perform by myself. But you can't ignore the audience either. Got an idea! You go on for us. What? You're kidding. Go stand on the stage with the mic. As you are aware the public is showing a little doubt towards our government. We know they're influenced by the entertainment industry. And you're the most powerful person who can control the public. Our prime minister recognizes your great work. We'd like to support you to the best of our ability. By the way, the duo that you're currently promoting... the youth are going crazy which is great. But we're concerned about their reckless personal lives. We heard a few alarming rumors. What we're looking for is... - Love. - Yes! Love and peace. We want the public to care more about those things. That's what they should be interested in anyway. There's this son of a known figure who wishes to be a singer. He's kind of handsome and not a bad singer. Would you kindly look after him under your company? He's got great potential for sure. The duo will go down soon. Besides, they're kind of... Vulgar. I'm a pro singer! King Shingo is here! - Where the hell were you? - Kan, my buddy! Pull yourself together! How come you're not on stage? Crap! Whenever I'm in love my happiness starts overflowing Don't be so kind to me because it makes me cry I wonder why? Deep down inside my heart There's a little secret door I will open it just for you And show you what's inside When that happens I become yours Whenever I'm with you alone my happiness starts overflowing We connect from heart to heart as if it were telepathy I wonder why? There's no need to explain Because it's written all over your face Same goes for me Let's be honest to each other When that happens I become yours Deep down inside my heart There's a little secret door I'll open it just for you And show you what's inside When that happens We become one When that happens We become one, one, one Stop it, Shingo! I'm going solo! Listen to me! Um...uh... Today, I... ...well... Oh yeah! I'm gonna sing a new song! Hey, baby. I dedicate this song to you! A man can be powerless against a woman (Uh-huh) Just a little smile from her melts down his heart A man in love can be so foolish She walks all over him, yet he's head over heels in love The vanity girl shuns the man with a cold stare (Go away) He gets more and more obsessed with her Hopelessly in love with her Floating in the air with a stupid look on his face Out! Out! Out! Out! Out! Out! Out! Out! Out! Marriage, marriage, marriage... All I want is peace! If the world beyond is peaceful This world also should be peaceful I'm an angel from the world beyond Reforming this world into the world beyond Peace mark, peace mark Baby, love me like an angel Peace mark, peace mark Baby, love me like an angel Peace mark, peace mark Baby, love me like an angel Petrol will fall like rain Says a trustworthy source It was just a rumor at first, but now no one smokes anymore Petrol will fall like rain Nobody knows when Sky is grey day after day Keep checking the weathercast Watching people landing at an airport Captured through a telephoto lens World scale dismal long queue All erased by the TV news Cloudy water comes from the tap Pour the water into a glass and gulp it down World scale soft revolution All erased by the TV news - Good morning. - Good morning. - Morning. - Beautiful as ever, Ma'am. Oh dear, naughty boys. You shouldn't be resting here! Get a move on! You bald bastard! Jackass! Stop it! Oh, Mr. Kaoru. Whatever the reason, you shouldn't bully the weak. Please reconcile yourselves for my sake? I'm very sorry to show you something unpleasant. Off you go then. Yes, Sir. Please excuse me. Here, take my hand. Geez... What's so good about that jerk? I really can't stand a hypocrite like him. Hey, Kan. Why don't we give up singing? Don't be a wuss. Aren't we stardust? We're just dust. You know what, I've always been left out since my childhood. I always ruin things, don't I? So...to get people's attention I dreamed about becoming a star. I was determined to be one at any cost. Stupid me, huh? Hey, you wanna know my secret? Actually I was abandoned as a child. Not so unusual. Really? 'coz I was, too. We're similar. I've got a bigger secret. I hope it's a good one. - Touch my chest. - What? Just touch me. What the hell! - What're you on about? - I kinda knew! - Idiot! You got it wrong. - So you are! I'm not! - Listen, it's about my heart! - I'm not! Your heart? My heart is on the right. - That's it? - Huh? It's rare. - Not really. - What? It's on the right side! - Me too. - What? So you two are... No, not what you think! There's a reason! Only God knows our evil fate, we inherited the karma of our parents. - You lost me. - How did you find us? I heard the sound of a crap harmonica. Shouldn't you stay away from scum like us? I'm still in charge of your fan club! We're done. Leave us alone. You're the newcomer of the year! We had good eyes, huh? Right? Actually, I want you two to be on stage with me at my next concert. Yeah? The three of us together! Are you sure? Thanks Marimo! I'll pass, I'm afraid. How come? I'm done with those fake acts. You quit singing? No, I wanna start again, from scratch. In a tiny venue. I'll make myself a big star with no one's influence. Kan! You've said it just right! I was thinking the same! I feel like I can write an awesome song. Okay, I'm in with you guys. Huh? What about the contract? No official contracts offered here. As I'm a girl, remember? All right! We'll quit that damn company! Idiot! She's doing great right now. - Whose side are you? - Me? - I'll run Marimo's fan club. - You prick! - Make a badge? - Like? - Cute round Marimo badge. - Sounds great! - Thanks! - And what about me? - Vice-chair? - Great! They're all goddamn kids. I thought I'd find some cute woman. You should be more careful. Gossip spreads fast. That's easily covered up. Anyway, have you found that girl yet? Marimo? Not her, she's a big star now, no scandals. Do I look like I care? My popularity has plateaued. You need a scandal to catch the public's attention. But you two are teen idols, you must keep your image clean. Doh! That's the point, can't you see? The public love shocking gossip, don't they, huh? - Good work! - Thank you! See you again soon! Listen.You take Marimo out tomorrow. I wonder what the boss would say? Don't worry.The boss will be with my dad tomorrow. He can't do anything. You might as well call a gossip writer. The headline goes "Love song singers fall in love for real." Stop drinking. Piss off! Is this the place for the interview? Yes. I'm going back to the office, good luck! - Hey. - Kaoru! What are you doing here? Um... where's the reporter? I'm the one. Come sit here, will you? Let's have a toast first. We have plenty of time. Hold it! You two are banned as of today. - Why? - Dunno, it's an order. Maybe you both got fired, eh? - I'm here to see Marimo. - I run Marimo's fan club! Not a chance. Get out. C'mon, do us a favor. Wanna get beaten again? Come on, Shingo. Let's go. Marimo's not here. You're lying! No, I'm not! It's true. They took her out! - Where to? - I don't know! Tell me the truth! You know, he was in prison for stabbing 3 security guards before. They went to a hotel. Did they tell you what for? - Nope! - Get him! They said Kaoru is going as well! That bastard! Where're you going? Go back to bed, I'll be nice, baby. You see...it's for your benefit as well. It's...your first time, right? Come to me. Marimo! Open the music box Then close the curtain There's a storm outside I can tell with my eyes closed Adjust the wristwatch Then take off the tie There's a storm outside I know that already Sadly, tanned skin is already out of season Time never stops ticking we're getting old Sadly, tanned skin is already out of season Making me anxious we're getting old Please! Invent a time machine for me Please! Invent a time machine for me Please! Invent a time machine for me Sitting on a linoleum floor Then shut the curtain There's a storm outside Isn't that obvious? Taking time to dry my hair with a towel There's a storm outside so is my heart Sadly, tanned skin is already out of season Time never stops ticking we're getting old Sadly, tanned skin is already out of season Making me anxious we're getting old Please! Invent a time machine for me Please! Invent a time machine for me Please! Invent a time machine for me There's a storm outside My eyes are closed There's a storm outside I know that already There's a storm outside Isn't that obvious? There's a storm outside So is my heart We've been waiting for you. He's excited to see you. Mr. Minami is here, Sir. I've heard a lot about you. My son is doing well, thanks to you. Kaoru is the nation's favorite now. He's capturing every single youth's heart. I appreciate your great work. You saved my reputation, Minami. The reason why we asked you to come today is that we have a proposal for you with full confidence in your ability. You are a real pain in the ass. We'll end this here. Hand her over. Get them! Hey, look! It's Kaoru! If you sing just for money "I love you, only you" Those who believe shall be saved Since always without fail Spare no time to sleep Can't find time to sleep Keep moving fast and you'll forget it C-c-c-c-crazy C-c-c-c-crazy game A new chance comes every day C-c-c-c-crazy C-c-c-c-crazy game A new chance comes every day In a nutshell, we want you to promote our boss to the nation. It can't be that hard for a genius like you. Not a bad deal for you either. Your future is virtually guaranteed. You wouldn't back of now, would you? Of course not, Sir. We can count on him. Right? With him on our side, you're as good as ruling this country, Sir! Congratulations. If I could be a Messiah Where are we? If I could be a Messiah If I could be a Messiah What the heck? I need you all over the world Y, you two! I need you all over the world If I ran out of words Daddy! If I ran out of words If I ran out of words Kaoru. If I ran out of words All comes to nothing Time to say good bye Though children join hands with each other And start to sing in a circle C-c-c-c-crazy C-c-c-c-crazy game When our hearts linked together C-c-c-c-crazy C-c-c-c-crazy game When our hearts linked together Boss! Stay with us! Why did you protect me? Look, right chest. He's okay. The right chest? That can't be! Please, tell us the truth! Why did you protect me? Tell us who you really are! Listen to me It's a story from the past I abandoned my love This is my atonement Forgive me My heart stayed gray Since the day I left Not even a day Has it been clear The greatest pop idol in the world That's what I wanted to be To stay away from scandals With my superficial lover I did...making love Just once One mistake Laugh if you like My sons Don't shed any tears I lost interest in Singing What's left in my life is waves after waves of Sadness, emptiness My chance came to end yet I couldn't let my dream go My dream became producing the world's greatest pop idols I'm the real star Undoubtedly I'm the true star Time to say good bye When the curtain falls Believe me Then Minami died, mystery remained. Wait, that sounds so unrealistic. - How? - Nothing makes sense. What happened to that politician? Who cares about the details? You and all! A love story, huh? What happened to that Marimo? She's visiting her hometown. Where is it? Hokkaido. Look, do you think they believe you? - Anyhow, this is a true story. - Yeah, all true! What did you think? Was it interesting? Answer me, please? Geez, that's a no... Damn it! Just tell me what you guys want from us then! How about...that Kaoru guy's been keeping a grudge against us and he - takes revenge? - Stop! No revenge stories. - Careful at night...look! - Jesus, no! - I'm kidding. - Seriously, don't. All we can do now is become superstars again. You think we can? I'm positive! Okay then, we'll be stars again. Genuine superstars! Kan, hey. Stop messing about. Kan... wake up, you! Kan! Come on, Kan! A star. A star. We became stars, for real. Look at me, everyone.
