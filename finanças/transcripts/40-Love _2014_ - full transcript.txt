I think that's everything. See you. Bye. Bye. Keep up the good work. Bye Jérôme. Thanks for everything. Bye Jérôme. Thanks. We'll miss you, boss. Keep up the good work. Thank you all. Bye Jérôme. Thanks for coming. Work hard. Don't be sad. You're getting a new boss. It'll do you good. Good luck. Thanks. Bye. Good luck. FORTY LOVE It's a bit like what we do to football coaches, we substitute them. It's like telling Mourinho he's training the kids, not the pros. What do you think he'd do? - He'd leave. - It's the same for me. Can you set the table? You have to look on the bright side. Whilst looking for a new job, I'll meet new people, have new challenges. You can have lie-ins too! Absolutely, great idea! Will you take me to Paris? You'll find it boring. - I'll behave. - You'll get on my nerves. No, I'll go to the Nike Store. You should've said that first! They've got all the players outfits. Please! I'm not buying you that crap. I only want to have a look at them. Honest. Just a look, yeah right! Pretty please! Please! Give over and lend me a hand. How do you make the photo smaller? Should I use this photo? Or do I look stupid? - You always look stupid. - What? That's what you look like. - Like what? - Stupid. You're the one who looks stupid! Cheeky, stupid boy! Good bye. Mr Sauvage? Mr Jallenque's waiting for you on the 2nd floor. Have you always worked in mass retail? What happened at Devianne? I was regional manager of 20 stores. What happened at the end? The usual scenario. I was sidelined because of a drop in figures. We were making a profit, but they had new people coming in. Did you get a redundancy package? Yes, a good one. I can't complain. That's good. But it's never really easy to live with. Do you want to stay in the same field? In mass retail? Yes. I love it. I've only ever done that. I've 20 years in-house experience at Devianne. I didn't go to Uni and I don't speak English. I'm learning but I'm crap. It's not easy to compete with the upcoming youngsters but I know these jobs inside out. I see. I'll ask my associate. Have you got Antoine's number? No, for a manager. I'll explain. Tell him I sent you. He may be looking for someone. He's approachable. Thanks very much. Can I help you? No, I'm just looking. I'll ask if I need anything. That's the new collection. - All these? - Yes, everything along that wall. - On a day trip? - What are you doing here? Hi! Are you lost or what? I'm just checking things out. It's nice to see you! It's been a while. This is 100% synthetic leather. - Smell it. - It smells like leather! Touch it! It's synthetic. The sole's elastomer. I don't know what that is. It's non-slip. This is imitation suede for a buckskin effect. - It isn't? - No, it's fake. You can have the same model, with serrations, perforations or different pearls etc. - So you can customize them. Exactly! - A whole series? - Yes, everything's industrialized. I mean even the finishings? Yes. The guy showed me a video. Everything's calculated. Impressive! The end product is 20% cheaper than with classic production. I can have an exclusive contract. He's looking to win over his clients. Cheers! Here's to your project! He always does that. He's so strong! Nice! I'm home! Hi. Look what I got you. Hi, David. That's not a tennis shirt! What is it then? A swim suit? It's an any-old sport shirt. Not fancy enough to play tennis in? Just look at it. What's the 78 for on the back? It's crap. It's like the Unemployment Centre but in a fancy office. He looked at my CV, that's all. He said something about a friend of his. Who? Some guy. He gave me his number. That's great! I'm not sure. I've made a decision. I've thought things over. I'm going to start my own business. What do you mean? I have experience. I know everyone in the sector. The suppliers respect me. I'm going to develop my own label. You have to provoke your destiny. I can't work for others anymore. We're in the heart of the mass-retail Mecca here. I can't wait forever. No. I've had it with justifying my age, my English level, my qualifications. I'll be my own boss. The time is now. What sort of business? I have an idea but I need to do more research. You'll see. One of you counts the cars, the other the number of people entering the shop. How do we keep count? Draw sticks on a piece of paper for each one. Separate them properly, I need the info per hour. What's it for? Statistics. - For what? - That's my business. How much? Fifty Euros. Seventy. Guys, I'm unemployed too. And if someone asks questions? - It's not illegal. - Apart from being paid cash. Just say your drawing lines. They can't arrest you for that. Hello. I'd like to see the Manager. - Is he expecting you? - No, I'm from Health & Safety. He's not here but I'll see if his assistant is. - Inspector. - Hello. Please follow me. - Is this 2011? - Yes, the second semester. I'd like to see the latest sales ledger please. Here you go. If I need any further documents, I'll ask. You OK? - Have a good day? - Have you got my stuff? Your bag's in the back. From 12 to 1pm, twelve people. From 1 to 2pm... How many from 12 to 1pm? Twelve! From 2 to 3pm, eighteen people. From 3 to 4pm, sixteen people. From 4 to 5pm... twenty three people. What about cars? From 1 to 2pm, twenty seven cars. From 2 to 3pm, twenty one cars. From 3 to 4pm, thirteen. From 4 to 5pm, thirty four. It's not bad here either. I've never been before. - What are you doing? - Just having a look. I'm gonna be late! We've got plenty of time. Look how pretty it is. It's horrible! It's lovely, look at the structure. Dad, I'm gonna be late! Dad! Just a quick look. - Dad, come back! - Just a sec. I'll miss my match! I'll be quick. Run! - Can you let him off? - It's impossible. It is possible, this is stupid! It's a case of WO, that's that. - What's WO? - Walk Over, he loses. Because he was late. - You're 30 minutes late. - The rule's 15. We were held up in traffic works. We're from out of town. A technical report's been filed. This is absurd! They want to play. We came all this way! 15 or 16 minutes would be OK. But 30! They're only 25 minutes late! Even more reason! You've waited, the kids want to play. There are rules and there's spirit. This is ridiculous. I agree, but rules are rules. And I have to follow them. Ugo. So it's the kids that lose out. If we don't teach them respect at their age... This is stupid! My hands are tied. So untie them if you're in charge! I'm applying the rules. Why not change them? I can't do that. Rules change all the time! Assholes! I'm sorry. He's the one you should apologize to. I know what to say to my son, thanks. Maybe I can help out? I can drive him to matches. Or your wife, maybe? My wife works, but thanks for worrying. Your son's a good player. He's young, so to check his limits, he's playing tournaments. Good idea. Ugo's eager, but he needs your backing. Cut it out. He's 11. He plays and has fun. Right now, he's not playing. Ugo, don't make a scene! I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. There'll be other matches. Ugo, please. What doesn't kill us makes us stronger. Let's go. Go get your stuff. That's enough! It's not as if you're overly-busy right now. You could at least arrive on time for a match. All that just to go see your crappy shops. I didn't know they were so stupid. Put yourself in his shoes, of course he's upset. He missed a tennis match, it's no big deal! Nothing's ever a big deal for you. We always visit your shops, even when we go on holiday. You're pissing me off, Ugo! It's not all about you. I'll visit shops when I like! I don't see why you had to go see the shopping centre either. - It's called work. - It could've waited. Did you call the guy the head hunter told you about? I'm no beggar. Let him call me if he's interested. - So you've always sold tools? - Yes for D.I.Y. For the home: panelling, joinery, paint. Did you learn on the job? So you want your own business? Will you just sell shoes? It'll be a shoe palace for women. 3 miles of aisles lined with women's shoes. I'm doing it for my wife and all women! But especially for her. What I like about your project, other than it's for women, is that you're independent. I don't want my staff sold to a big firm. I don't care about the price so long as it's fair. But my staffs a different kettle of fish. I'll take on your lease and the staff on the same conditions. We seem to be on the same wave length. Can we sign a sale's agreement? It'll give you time to think it over. Deal. - You took your time! - Let me park. Faster! I wanted to meet as Ugo's results are interesting. The League takes kids on at the start of the season. - But a kid has dropped out. - He stopped playing? He can't play tennis intensively, so there's a place free we'd like Ugo to take. So it's a sports studies camp? No, he'd still live at home, doesn't change school but we train him. It'd be extra to the work he currently does with Sylvie. We prepare him for the Championship. Ugo's in the local championship, late June. We follow hundreds of kids. Sylvie chose Ugo. We aim to find the best within a certain age group. We prepare them to play in the local league. And if I win that? If you win that you'll join the national sports studies program in Paris. The national centre's at Roland Garros. - Really? - Yep! It's the fast track but the road is long. The federation takes one player per region. The fast track to what? To becoming pro, like the others: Tsonga, Simon, Gasquet, Monfils... Without exception. - Would you like to do that? - Yeah! It's a different kind of life. You have to sleep there and play tennis every single day. That's what I want! There's a problem with the cardio machine. - Did you reboot it? - Yes, Mice. - What's the problem? - The figures are incoherent. - Did you do a manual check? - No. It's not the machine. Patrick? Come take a look! It'll interest you. Can you go again? Sixty! Every time. And on a flat? I don't know he's been running half an hour. What's going on? Your son has a really low heart rate. Do you cycle? - No, I play tennis. - You should cycle. Or do athletics, you're made for it. Nature's unfair. He has a rare heart. It's his physiological inheritance. Are you sporty? I used to be. My heart was strong. What did you do? Tennis too? No, I played football but only as a youngster. I played youth national league then in the minor league. Injury? No, it wasn't what I wanted to do. When I gotta training camp, I started going out and I missed the boat. We rarely get a second chance. I'm not complaining. Afterwards I met my wife. I found my vocation. It's just as good. Didn't you miss the sport? I missed the adrenalin and the competition. But you make up for it. In my job, I was always under pressure. The sensation's the same. Tennis is great too. It requires lots of qualities and with a heart like his he'll be impossible to wear out. Hurry up Ugo! I'll leave without you, I've got an important appointment. - Whose shirt is that? - Federer's! You'd better be as good then! I do that, look. Look! I do that. You looked! You're not allowed to, OK? Otherwise I get to hit you! If I do that and you notice, without looking... If you feel it then you have to put your finger inside. Then if you take it out quick, you get to give me 5. But if you put it in and I trap you... If you get trapped for like 10 seconds, then I give you 10. Do you get it? Not at all! C'mon! When I do that, you can't look. That's it! So you do get it! 1, 2, 3, 4... I get to give you 10! Morning everyone! That group too! A moment of your time, please. This is Ugo, he's here till the end of the season. Hi Ugo. - You can say hi. - We don't know him. All the more reason to say hi! 137. 137 too. 139. 119. 132. 134. Start over, Loris, but reach higher. - Good! - 162. Like a bullet! Will you teach me? Let's keep going. 137. How many articles? 500 references with sales replacements every 2 days. - That's a stock of... - Two month's. And the suppliers? I work with them directly on an exclusive range contract. Does that go for brands too? Yes. How many collections? 4 per year, like for clothes with a weekly special. The plan is to start in September with a special launch, and reach sales objectives by the end of the year. Did you pre-empt the shop? Yes. It's outside the shopping mall, in an autonomous space, in a zone impossible to build on further. I found other potential spaces with the same characteristics. With the same frequentations? Yes. Is there an obligation to keep the staff? Nothing contractual. No threat of strike? Can we bulldoze on? No problem at all. It's an interesting proposition. We need to study it. Let's reconvene next Tuesday. Perfect. - Thanks Jérôme. - Thank you. 850m² shop floor and 70m² of offices above. Are you going to sell tools? No, I'm going to sell shoes. As many as you can find. We have to invent everything. You could do the plans for the aisles. I don't know how to anymore. What's up? - I don't know. - What's wrong? I've put an option on the shop. We deserve to be happy. I don't think I understand anything. There's nothing to understand, just be happy. Just be happy. How will you pay for the shop? No bank will back you. I know that, it's no big deal. Who cares? How will you get the money? I asked Devianne. They're considering it. My project's solid. They'll back me. You said you didn't want anything more to do with them, that you didn't want a boss. This is different, it's my business. We're on an equal footing. I love supermarkets. I love it when the car parks are full, when we have to lock the doors 'cos it's the sales. I love it! I love seeing the families show up, seeing the place full and kids' faces when they see the toy aisle. It moves me and makes me happy. I don't want to end up in an off-site office. - That's no me. - I know. Sorry, I'm tired. Don't cry. - It's scary. - Don't worry. It's a pleasure to inaugurate this multimedia centre with you Mr Mayor. The building is energy saving, thanks to its bay windows with air vents that help create natural heat. A rule in architecture is that a building adapts to its surroundings, as much as the surroundings do to it, as the great Victor Hugo said. Let's hope our multimedia centre breathes culture and generosity. Thank you. - Teach me to whistle with my fingers. - Not here. Why not? Anyone would think they're World Champions... You found work quickly! Well done. You must be proud. Yeah, I created the job. I realized I had to be active. It's great. It wouldn't be easy being over forty and cooped up at home. There's plenty to mull over. I realized early on, if you doubt, it's over. Excuse me, I'm going to find Laura. - Bye. - See you. Let's go. So you do love us a little then! Do you like it? Isn't it pretty? - Did you notice? - You're both very handsome! Hello Jérôme. Hello, Mr Darbois. May I congratulate you? Thanks. An opportunity came up and I took it. Great, I didn't know that. Well done! I was congratulating you about your wife. She did a great job. I really enjoyed working with her. I see. And I love living with her. We said no more shoes! I know but I can't help myself! I do it for them. I see the shoes and think this is the best for them. So I buy them. That's sweet. If I build shelves like these, I calculated there's enough room for me to buy you a new pair every month for another 5 years. And after that? I'll make more shelves. And so on. Until I die. Yes! No! On the court boys! We're running late! I don't want any excuses. Get on the court! Push down harder. Push on your legs and lift your chests. Quicken it up. Keep up the rhythm and don't forget to breathe. Romain, it's over for you. Again! Keep going even if it hurts! Dig deep! Right to the end, touch the line! Level 6. Stop there! Not bad guys! Well done Loris. High level tennis is 99% pain and 1% pleasure. The greatest pleasure is winning, but you sometimes have to push your limits. Keep going! Keep going! 15 seconds more, then get your rackets. Go to bed, Ugo. And put your shirt in the wash, it's filthy! Jérôme, I'm leaving. Where are you going? I'm leaving home. - What do you mean? - I'm leaving you. No way! You can't leave now. You can't do that. There's never a good moment. I'm sorry. I couldn't leave when you were unemployed but I can't keep lying to you. Don't leave. Is there someone else? No. Don't you love me anymore? That's not it. Of course it is. You must know! I love you and I don't. I no longer understand you and it's wearing me out. I feel like an outsider, a stranger. Despite everything I do for you? I don't understand what you want anymore, the shopping centres, the shops. But at the same time I know... you love it and you're happy. It's been tricky lately. - Things are gonna get better. - It's not just that. We've come to the end of a chapter. We're out of synch. Don't step back! Move up to the ball. Don't step back! Move up! That's it! Move up to the ball! Go on! That's it! That's great! That's what we're looking for! Again. Hit! Speed up, send the balls quicker! That's great Ugo! Let's go! The last ones! Move up! Good! That's good. You must move up to gain terrain. That's modern tennis for you. The top players have animal instinct. They defend their territory. Get it? What are you doing? Packing up. Did I say you'd finished? Give me 50 forehands, 50 backhands, cross court, down the line! Talent and practice are what make a champion. If you don't move up on the ball, your opponent will. Believe me! What are you doing? Nothing. I took a sleeping pill. Can't you sleep? No. When the doctor said I had a low heart rate, does that mean it could stop? Why would it stop? 'Cos it beats too slow. Come here. Nothing's gonna happen to you, OK? Go to bed, it's late. Hello, sorry to have kept you waiting. No problem. Millard's not here so we can do this quickly. I don't know if you've heard, but the project's been rejected. No, I didn't know. Millard talked to the Strategy Department. The project's not a priority for us, it's too classic and not in synch with our profession. Apparently, your business plan's not valid. Your former contract has a restraint clause on textile by-products. You can't continue. Sorry Jérôme, it's interesting but Millard can't take it on. That's the way the cookie crumbles. Thanks anyway. Keep playing to a winning tie break. 5-2! What happened? I don't know. You have to know. Otherwise there's a problem. You're all over the place on court. That's why you took a thrashing. He was better than me. If you want to go to Roland Garros, you'll have to buck up. I simply think you don't want it enough. A real competitor doesn't accept defeat. That's not true. What isn't? That I don't care about losing. Prove it then! Dad? I'll be right back. What is it? You're sleeping? I needed to. Sylvie's here. She needs to talk to you. She's downstairs? Fuck, Ugo! Your mum called. What did she say? Nothing interesting, but you must call her back. - Sorry, I was working. - Sorry to disturb you. It's a bit out of the blue. It's OK. Would you like some water? No, thanks. I'm thirsty! I just dropped in to say, Ugo's got his first match in 3 days and he needs a medical certificate. He's fine, he doesn't need to see a doctor. The referee won't let him play otherwise. I can take him. No, I'll take him. Ugo's told me what's going on... Everything's fine. We'll go tomorrow. I said I'd take him but I forgot. - You'll take him then? - Yes. Bye. There's someone at the door. Gerets, come in! You playing dead? I've left loads of messages. I'd have been better off playing football. I would've had some money. I've got nothing left, so my wife has decided to go where the grass is greener. It's probably my fault. I just can't work out when I fucked up, that's hard to swallow. It'll get better. Give it time. So you like tennis? I gave her everything. And would've kept on. But you still get chucked aside. I don't think time will help me understand how someone who loved you could do that. It'd be better if she'd died. At least, you can put that down to fate. This way you miss her and you suffer from abandon. She chose to leave. I really don't... I don't understand. Maybe she'll come back. I know. What I hate most, is the thought of her sleeping with Darbois. Do you think she is? I don't know. She must be. You ask her! Time for bed, son. Good night. Up you get! Get up! Get up, we're going out! I'm ten, I got to school and hear your sweet words in my ear I laugh, in class I dream, I fly you don't have to believe me just watch me at break Wednesday's I walk straw in my ice cold glass I hassle the pretty girls and the silly boys It tastes like Belgian stew! The good thing is I kept it simple. What's Belgian stew? What? What's Belgian stew? A magic potion to boost cyclists. A little medicinal mix. Take the paint pot. Let's have some fun! Move it! - What do you want me to do? - Grab a brush and do some graffiti. I don't want to. It's to piss Darbois off. Go on! - Darbois won't care. - But we do. Do it yourself! I'll fall through that! Have some fun! - Paint something big! - Like what? Just go for it! Paint a dick! Go on a huge dick and balls! And pubes! Paint some pubes! It's fun, see? Imagine the look on Darbois' face when he sees a dick on his air-cooled windows! Sweetie! Hi Mum. Did you sleep over? I came for a visit. We were just talking about you. Really? - About your holidays. My agency has a work site near Naples. So some of us are going and plan to holiday there too. We'll have a big house. We'd go for two months. Two months, no way! We could visit Pompeii. Do you know about Pompeii? What does he care about Pompeii? I'm talking to Ugo. Ugo wants to stay here. I'm not gonna stay all alone like a jackass. What do you say? I don't know, it depends on tennis. You can come after your matches. I'll come get you. Italy's beautiful, you'll see. - Can Dad come too? - No chance. What? Does it have to be like this? 15-40. Game Sauvage. Sauvage leads 5 games to 3. First set. Yes, Gerets? I'm on my way! No, I hadn't forgotten! I'm on the Industrial zone. I'll be there in 2 minutes. I'm almost there. See you in a minute. Gerets tells me you're old, shop floor, style. You could say that. There's always something going on here. We're looking for someone to boost the teams. After years of working together things start to stagnate. I'll show you the sorting machine then we can have a chat. These are the loading ramps. There are 8 per block. You can imagine the turnover. Marc? Show Mr Sauvage the second warehouse later and the work site too. It's worth thinking over. Keep your head still. Can you feel it pull? - Where were you? - In Cambrai! Sorry! I won! - What did you win? - My match! Well done! Bye! It was a great match! Congratulations! Nothing to do with me! I should congratulate you. Two more matches then it's off to Paris. Do you think he'll make it? It'll be hard. There's one boy who's better than the others. But it's possible, yes. He's a quick learner. It's rare. What happens to me when he leaves? Isn't he a bit young? No, they're all doing sports studies. His opponent today does too. That's not good publicity. Ugo beats them every time. He's talented. That's for sure. Great! Next time I'll have two kids to avoid any disappointment. I'll always have one at home! - See you soon! - Thanks for everything! What did you make the mash with? Water. You didn't use milk? Know what Murray, Gasquet and Djoko have in common? - They're tennis players. - No! They're all coached by their mum or dad. If I get to Roland Garros, you could be my coach. You'd be with me at tournaments. Don't you like Sylvie? Players have several coaches. We'd be a team. You want a harem! If I win it'd be great, you wouldn't be alone. If you win, we'll see. I'd be your fitness coach, I don't know a thing about tennis. You're a bit waif-like. Out! Game, set and match, Ugo Sauvage. 6-1, 7-5. Congratulations. 30-0. Thanks. Nothing to write home about! He was under pressure. He did well in the end. They waited for the other to make a mistake. It could've been a beginner's match. He won though. It's a poor win. He won't get far playing like that. He'll get chewed up in the final. You said he stood a chance. Sylvie said he's progressed. But he's even better. Loris won't be kind to him. 40-15. It's clear he needs to play better in the final. He's got a week to get back on form. Nadal hit with all his might but Djokovic gave his best. The Serb returned the Spaniards service to perfection and touched the line Mice, well out of reach of his opponent. After losing the first set, Nadal fought back... He fought back. He fought back like a champion and won the second set after a thrilling tie-break. He took his revenge on the Serb and was able to clench his fists in victory like a Spanish bull. Have you already seen a bull clench its fists? It's an image. Have you read it to your dad? - How is he? - OK. He's gonna be my coach if I make itto Roland Garros. A winning team. It sounds promising! He'll teach me the exercises he did for football. How are things at home? He's not too sad? What does he say about it? Nothing, just that your architect's an ass. What do you think? I don't care. I'd like you to come back home. You know... what happened between me and Dad will be easier to understand when you're older. Or not. But these things happen to adults all the time. I hear you got good results! School's easy! When can I come see you play? When I reach Roland Garros. I'm superstitious. - You're what? Superstitions. I don't blame you. When's the final? Sunday. I'm sure you'll win. It's a superb space divided in 3 parts. It's huge and it's heated. They're insulating it. It's huge and holds 21 quays. It's 10 metres high. I can pile up 5 pallets. It's easily accessible from Cambrai. Did you find a house? I called the agency and setup 2 visits. We're waiting for you. We're counting on you. I know. - We'll see more matches. - I don't care. - Cambrai's real close. - I don't care. Watch your mouth! You didn't even tell me! Nonsense! I was negotiating. You're lying! You liar! Stop being a spoilt brat! Do you think it's easy to find a job? Do you think I can be fussy? If I continue doing nothing, I'll go mad. I need to work. You said we'd go to Roland Garros! That you'd be my coach. You don't think I can win! That's not true, Ugo. I'm just saying don't reach too high. Don't get carried away. That's all. Your opponent's already beaten you, he's stronger. It's good to believe, but you have to be realistic. There's no magic formula. It's horrible here. We don't know that. It's not worse than elsewhere. Maybe we'll like it. I want to go to Roland Garros. I've got one more match, that's all. I'm gonna win and we'll go to Roland Garros. We'll see. Did you sleep well? Not bad. I made you an orange juice. I'm not thirsty. Are you coming to watch me play? Of course! It's the final. You have to eat or you'll have no energy. Nerves are normal but once you start playing, you'll be OK. I'm not nervous. Don't I get a hello? Hi Ugo. Hold still. Come a bit closer. Game and first set, Barres. 6 games to 3. - I need the loo. - OK, 3 minutes, no more. Do you want me to fill your bottle? Ugo, are you OK? Yeah. You sure? You're not allowed to speak to me during matches. They could disqualify me. Hang on in there. It's not over yet. - I know. - Go for it! 30-0. 40-15. Game Barres. Barres leads 4 games to 2, second set. 15-0. 30-0. Game and second set, Sauvage. One set all. What's up? I feel weird. Weird how? I don't really know. Watch my fingers. Keep your head still and move your eyes. Can you see both fingers? - Did you drink between games? - Yes. - Take these vitamins. - Thanks. If you still feel weird at the next change, tell me. Let's go. 15-0. 30-0. 40-0. Loris! Are you OK? Can you hear me? Open your eyes and look at me. Loris, it's Dad, can you hear me? My God! Open your eyes, son. What's wrong with him? Dad! What's wrong? What is it? I've got cramp! It'll pass. It's OK. It's because you're tired. Breathe. I'd like to speak to Jérôme Sauvage, please. Who's speaking? It's the police. I'll go get him. Dad? Loris Barres was taken to hospital last night. He had a heart attack. Doctors put him on breathing apparatus. It was an allergic reaction. This isn't fun but I have to find out if it was an accident or not. Your friend's in a coma. He's not my friend. I hardly know him. The doctors found traces of a suspect substance in his blood. Temazepam. It's a strong sleeping pill. How old are you? Eleven. A colleague, specialized in minors under 13, will question him. I'll take down your statement. Where's Marie? She's on her way. You didn't do it, no one did. Do you understand? Do you hear? You did nothing at all. Let me make myself clear, Ugo, you say nothing, OK? Not a word! I'm listening. You have nothing to say at all? No idea? No suspicions? You saw nothing, didn't notice anything? No, nothing. Do you know what's going to happen? We've kept all of young Barres' things in sealed bags. We're analyzing the fingerprints on his water bottle. If they're either of yours, we'll search your home. Even 1 mg of that sleeping pill will be enough proof. But you can remain silent if you like. But if you're involved, you're just making your case worse. That goes for your son, too. Married? Separated. Divorced? - Not yet. Married then. Address? 26 Avenue de Brigade, Villeneuve d'Ascq. This computer's a piece of shit! I doped the boy. I put the sleeping pills in his water. They're my pills. My son's more talented than the others. I realized that he lives and breathes for the game. I saw him battling away and I know the system's ruthless. So I wanted to balance things out. By using poison? No, with sleeping pills. I did it for my son, not against the other boy. I have no idea about tennis. It's not my world. My son's small. On court, I wanted... the world's imperfections to disappear. So he could dream a little while longer. Didn't you think it could backfire? I didn't know he'd be allergic to it. I didn't think of that. Your dad says he poisoned your opponent. Do you believe him? I don't know. Did he tell you he was going to poison your opponent? Will my dad go to prison? The judge will decide. We don't know. My dad didn't do it. I did. You put the sleeping pills in the bottle? Yes. Ugo, no more lies. We're the police. There's been a serious accident. Do you understand? Who inserted the pills? You or your dad? I did. I went to the loo, at the end of the first set, to fill the bottles. I put two pills in the water that I crushed with my shoe. Did your dad ask you to do it? No. Why did you do it? I wanted to keep playing tennis. Let's go. We have news from the hospital, Barres is out of the coma. He'll be fine. The bad news is that I have to file a report, it isn't over. I don't understand. Your prints aren't on the bottle. But your son's are. The analysis report confirms his statement. So you lied to me. Tell them it was me. I made him take the bottles! He didn't realize what he was doing, he's just a kid! His only saviour is he's fantastic at tennis. He wanted to be the best so bad that he cocked up. Tell them they're my prints. They're my pills. It doesn't make any difference to you. What you don't seem to understand is I don't make the rules. If he did it, you can't erase what he's done. Would you like to change your statement? No, I did it. Let's go. Leave this behind for a while, you need to rest, and we'll meet up in September. Me or another psychiatrist will try to understand what happened. Try to take your mind off it. In a few years, when you're older, maybe you could play again. Just for fun.
