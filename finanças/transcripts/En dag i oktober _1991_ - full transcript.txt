To put Casablanca right into the shade, Hitler entertains his Axis partner in Berlin. First item is that well-known maneuver recently renamed the Westward Advance. Put that away. He's not going to shoot you. Go, get out of here. Easy. This thing's delicate. - There it is. - Hey. That's it. Turn it up. This is the BBC London, broadcasting to Denmark. We send greetings to Hamlet this evening from Horatio. Hamlet must quench the brewer's thirst with something cold. I repeat, we send greetings to Hamlet this evening- - Are we Hamlet? Tomorrow with the whole damn RAF. Without wings. We need some more light over here, Willy. Where's the other torch? Valdez, Dalmar, and Duncan could picnic- - Gently. Don't force it. Okay, I'm trying. Good. That's it. Get out of here! Go, go, go! Can I get you something? Solomon. Emma. Petersens, dear. They can't hear a thing. All right, mother, don't worry. Sorry. The curfew's on, you have to be more careful. Was there trouble again at the theater? No, I just sat down in the park for a minute, that's all. It's not all. Your father says the factory's been bombed. And he shuts himself in there, listening to his music louder than ever, getting himself all wound up. Keep trying to tell him that nothing's going to happen to us. This is Denmark. He says I should know better. We'll be fine. Won't we? - Coffee, dear? - No. Last night, the cinema, tonight, the factory. These foolish youngsters, they don't understand. Their sabotage would only make things worse for us. Aren't they on our side? The only people on your side, Sara, are right here in this room. What resistance have we ever given the Germans? The war is not being fought here, Sara. If the Germans want Danish meat, if they want Danish butter, we let them have it. We might as well join the Gestapo. Sara, please. Both of you. Can't we have one without this argument? You don't like it when I say it, fine, but that is the king's position. The king is under arrest. The king is on our side too, Sara. Rosh Hashanah is one week away. Would it be too much to want one week of peace? It is. Yes. Sara, enough. Sara. What are you doing? Has father left? Who is this? Has he left? Yes, yes, who is he?! Found him last night. Oh god, still bleeding! He's been shot. Help me bring him in the house. Wait a minute. Look at him. Sara. He's lost so much blood. Sara, you need to get Dr. Thompson. We can't do that. He's going to die in your bed. I was stopped last night on the way home. They were looking for a wounded man. They'll be watching every doctor's house. You're gonna have us arrested, Sara. Please. I can't do this our life- - Yes you can, you can do it. - If I remember how to do it. You can do it. You have to. Get me a pot of boiling water and a candle. - What else, what else? - More gauze. The guard told me they killed a saboteur last night. Larsen asked the Gestapo about displaying the body. Someone said no, thank God. They caught two of them. This is from Larsen. Now, if they catch them, they just shoot them. All his bright colors were gone. No one could tell if this had happened on his voyage or was the result of grief. He looked at the little lady. She looked at him. And he could feel he was melting, but he still stood staunchly, with his arms at the shoulder, then a door opened. The draft caught the dancer and she flew right into the stove to the tin soldier. Been a while since anyone's read to me. I fell before. You were shot. Yes. But I meant just before... You fainted. It was... You all right? Who are you? Sara. Sara Kublitz. Where am I? In my room. How did I get here? I found you last night. Outside. You were lying there. Where exactly are we? Verum. Near the radio factory? Not far. My father's the bookkeeper there. Are you the one the Germans are looking for? Sara, could I please have my pants? Well, they're covered in blood. Could I have them? I washed them, they're all wet. I'm sorry. I have to go. You can stay. Are you hungry? - There's soup if you like. - No, I can't. You should have something. Emma? That's my father. He doesn't know you're here. What's your name? What's your name? Hence. Please. Stay. I just saw something terrible. What? Larsen's men. They were dragging some boy away. Emma. Just worse and worse. What is it? They're just tearing the country apart. - What's happening? - Look at this. They're searching for this one, arrested some of his friends. Sit down, Solomon. That building that was blown up last night. was in it. No. He's dead. For what? For what, Emma? I don't know. What is that? What? What're you doing with that? It's the Sabbath. Solomon, I... And why aren't the candles lit? Solomon, we have to tell you something. What is going on here? Who is this? Who is this?! His name's Hence. Sara, look at this! Papa, he was lying there, he was bleeding. You have to leave, you have to leave now. Be careful. People are being shot by helping the resistance. Sara I can understand. But Emma, what on Earth were you thinking of? Solomon dear, we didn't join the resistance. Just helped a wounded man. How did he get in here? Did he threaten you, Emma? No, Solomon. He was almost dead when I found him. Well, he's looking very much alive in there. Wrapped up on your blanket. Where did you find him? Under the hedge, last night. My God. I put him in the shed. Sara. Solomon, we did what we had to. I told Sara that if he can walk, he has to go. We need to talk, my friend. Look, I'm not the Gestapo. I'm a Jew. And if they find you here, we're all dead. You work at the radio factory, don't you? Yes. What about it? So now you're working for them. I am a bookkeeper. What about your country? Don't you lecture me about patriotism! What happened to the others? Two were captured. One was killed. And you blew up the wrong building. You killed an innocent man last night. I don't know, Emma. Perhaps this is one of Sara's daydreams, hmm? And tomorrow morning, we will all wake up and we will all go to services together and our guest will not be here anymore. Danes and Jews. That's what you both used to talk about. Isn't it? Mother. Yes. - What about now? - This is different! Why? Why is it different? What are we tonight? We are a family. And this is Shabbos. Please. Sara. Thank you. You had a difficult night. I'm all right. That song you sang with your family last night. What's it about? It welcomes the Sabbath, and peace into our house. Today, Saturday, it's our Sabbath. Is it Saturday? Yes. You wouldn't have a cigarette? You know, we haven't missed a Sabbath service since 1940. April. Will you join me? I can't. Lighting a flame is forbidden during the Sabbath. Well, I'll light it for you. It doesn't work that way. Smoking keeps the fire lit. That's not necessary. Have to honor the house rules. Well, we've all got to make sacrifices from time to time. But you know, these last three years, we have been left alone, for the most part. Well, I see you have started to get your appetite back. Perhaps now you can leave us. I'll give you some clothes. It won't work, Mr. Kublitz. What? Being reasonable? Look at what my wife and my daughter have done for you. Why can't you just be thankful and go? You know what they've started making at your factory. I know how much money comes in and how much money goes out. You know a lot more than that. Just tell me the right building and you can go back to pretending there's no war on in Denmark. I am a Dane, just as you are. What you're doing may be your choice, but it's not mine. They make rocket parts right in front of you. You listen to me. I have nothing to do with that. When the time comes, Mr. Kublitz, the Germans wouldn't give a damn how much of a Dane you think you are, or how well you add and subtract. What are you doing? Just looking. Put that away. Put it away. I'm supposed to be keeping an eye on you. Do you know what they're making at your father's factory? It's not his factory. Do you know? Radio parts, things like that. I don't really know. Radio parts. They're making steering mechanisms for rocket bombs. Why should I believe you? Because I know. If you know so much, how come you blew up the wrong building? You think I'd risk my life to blow up radios? I don't know what you'd do. That's not really true, is it, Sara? ♪ Amen ♪ ♪ Amen ♪ My name is not Hence. It's Neils. Niels Jensen. He isn't threatening us. Just his being here as a threat. Sara. Don't let this man play with your emotions. It's the king's birthday tomorrow. I know. Remember three years ago? All the people in Townhall Square, singing. The king on his horse, reaching down, shaking hands. Was touching everybody's hands. I think he was trying to tell us that even though everything had changed, nothing would be different. But it's different now. Isn't it? Neils told me about what the Germans are doing at the factory. I don't want to believe him, or that... Is it true? Many things are true, Sara. Is it true that about 20 years ago, a young man fell in love with your mother, started a family? Is it true that this man loves his daughter? His family, his home, peace? And that he believes that the way to get his family through all this is to behave correctly. According to the law. I don't rock boats, Sara. I pay my fare and I ride. It is true. I'm sorry. It's all right. I understand. And I love you. A few weeks ago, I started hearing rumors. And then I came across it in numbers. Then I saw the memorandums, and then I knew, but what could I do? I have been praying to God every day to please give me some strength. I don't know what else to do. I'm sure there was nothing that you could have done. But now, couldn't you help him? A little. Solomon, you'll have to speak to the rabbi now. And tell him what? He might know someone who could help us. And then maybe we have even more of them in our house. I'm worried about Sara. So am I. I'm afraid I may do something foolish tomorrow. Oh, bookkeeping on a Sunday. Just a few loose ends, Heir Larsen. You Jews do have some admirable traits. Did you have a pleasant walk? Very nice, thank you. Did you get what you needed? Oh my God. - Solomon? - Hmm? Are we next? That's the one you want. Everything's in there, including your two friends. Are you sure it's them? It's the same two they brought it on Friday. One of them was wounded in the leg. I've got you what you wanted, and I'm finished with it. I can't very well blow it up with them in there. I don't care what you do. But if they knew when, they could make a break for it. You could warn them. You. You've got to warn them. I'm done with it. Now get out. Emma! Close the door. Mrs. Petersen. I risked my life. I'm risking theirs. And perhaps many more. Do you want their lives in German hands, or in yours? Mrs. Petersen's daughter just called her. That Danish Nazi she knows says an action against the Jews is only a matter of time. You wouldn't have a beer? I'll get it for you. Sit, Sara. I'll get you a plate. It's okay. Are you leaving? Not yet. I need your help. Do you have any bicycles? Show me. Hold this. Neils, what are we doing? Over here. You can't go near that place. They know you now. I know. That's what I need your father for. - My father? - He can walk right by them. You can't ask him to do that. He gave you what you wanted. You're using him. You're using me. You are. If you think it's war, Sara, act like it. He's gonna help us! It's up to all of us. You, me, and your parents. We're all Danes. Feel. Stop. Feel. They were brave boys. I know, dear. It's enough now, Solomon. Please, you've done enough. Please. Real tobacco? Courtesy of the RAF. Could you get back in that room? Why? You know others who could do this? They can't do what you can, get inside unquestioned with equipment that won't be searched. But they'll just rebuild it, or build it somewhere else. It won't make any difference. Time makes all the difference. Time can mean lives. What do I do? Attach this here. Then, to start the timer, hit total. Understand? You and your mother should be ready to leave at any moment. Pack small bag each. And then what? Kublitz. Heir Larsen. Numbers are best kept simple, right? The simpler, the better. Yes. Yes. Well, travel with a machine? Yes. Actually, at first, it was just the ribbon, but last night, the whole thing just went kaput. So I just picked up this new one. Oh, English. I found things at a cafe. They're one of my weaknesses. Would you like one? Why don't you just take the pack? Thank you, Kublitz. Thank you. You know, you're a lucky Jew, Kublitz. If it was my choice, you wouldn't be working here. Anywhere in Denmark. Maybe in Poland. Stinking up their soil. Two plus two equals four. Doesn't it? Mama. I can't. Can't do this. I can't fit our lives into two small bags. What has she got in here? Don't need this. Or this. Did you hear that? God damn you! It had to be done. My Shabbos candles. - Put them back. - It's too heavy. No no, they go back in. They go back in, no no, they go back in, no no. Where's your father? Shh. He's gonna need you. I need you. We all need you. Solomon? Solomon?! Thank God. Thank God. It's all right? It's all right. Larsen, factory security. I think he knows. That's it, then. We leave right now. Everything is ready. - Your bags are packed. - Yes. Come. Come, my dear, come. - Solomon. - Yes, yes. - Hurry. - Yes. Come. Come. It's almost curfew. Doesn't help. And they're going to be looking for at least three people. We could go to my brother David's. Where's that? It's North on the coast. Does he have a telephone? Yes. Then get word to him as soon as you can, tell him to get out of his house. What do you mean? They would go after him? It's possible. Now we need to split up. Neils, you go. We will stay together. No, Papa. I'm going with Neils. Sara, no. Two and two can move a lot easier than four. Sara, I want you here with us. Wait a minute, Solomon. She's right. Maybe we'd all be a lot safer if we separated. Right, now is there some place you two can stay? What about Dr. Thompson? Thompson, yes, of course. Sara, no. Trust me, please! Sara. Sara, I want you to meet us at the synagogue tomorrow. Early morning service. Give it another day. We should stay out of sight for a while. Just remember who you are, and what you are. You can stay here as long as you need. Thank you. Is there a telephone, please? This will do for tonight, but tomorrow morning we will go to the synagogue and talk to the rabbi. This morning service is canceled. I have very important news to give you. Last night, I got word from the most trusted sources that in two days, the German will raid every Jewish home in Copenhagen and Denmark. They will try to arrest each and every Jew. The situation is extremely serious. They know tomorrow is Rosh Hashanah, and that our families will be at home. We must take action right now. Leave the synagogue. Neils? They'll be all right, Sara. What about you? I'll make sure you're safe. I don't wanna be safe. What? I'm scared. I'm so scared you'll go off and... You're a pretty good reason for me to stay alive. Am I? But I'll be more careful, Sara. If you want me to. Operator, 32, 16, X, please. Thank you. It's Emma, Emma Kublitz. I know, I'm... Well, I needed to call you to tell you that no one can visit for the new year. That's right. Everyone is going away this year, dear. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Right away. It's bleeding. Maybe... Let's leave the last ones a few days, yeah? I'm sorry. It's okay. Danced naked in front of his coarse, brutal soldiers, that now jeered at their mad prince, who was bent on storming the gates of heaven and was mastered in a moment- - By one little gnat. Neils. Neils. Neils, you should be in Sweden. That's a hell of a welcome. So, what's news? These things are everywhere. But we've got a much bigger problem. - Sara. - Where's Mother? - Hiding. - What's wrong? What happened? There's no Rosh Hashanah frost this year. The Germans are arresting all the Jews. We have to leave. Now. But Neils is- - Forget him, Sara. Just walk away. - No, Papa, no. - You must. - I won't do that. - You must! - Tell me where to meet you. - Sara. Where? Festival Hill, number 12. Neils! Run away, run. Pretty eyes. What do you want? If I'd wanted you and your father, you'd be on a transport by now. Others can arrest the Jews. It's the saboteurs I'm after. I want Neils Jensen. No. And you're going to tell me. No. But then you want him to, don't you? Even though he's not a Jew boy. Is she here? What happened? He followed me. From the synagogue. Who did? Larsen. He's dead. I shot him. What? I shot him. Come sit. Come. How could you let this happen? I should never have left her alone. I'm sorry. You asked me to trust you! Solomon, stop it. It's enough. I made a mistake. Have you heard anything about the arrests? My friends are concerned that it might be another false alarm. Your friends aren't Jews. Some of them are. Emma and I made this list. They're friends. People who need to be warned. Thanks. Sara. All right, do the best you can. And good luck. Thank you. Thank you very much. See you tomorrow. Excuse me, please. The sea's too rough for a crossing tonight. So rest if you can. My sister and I got separated. How can I find her? People are hiding everywhere. It's impossible to say. I'm sorry. Everything will be all right. And God willing, tomorrow night, you'll find yourselves in Sweden. Emma and I want you to take this. If you don't need it for us, someone else might need it. I don't wanna leave you. Sara. You have to go. You know that, And I need to stay. Can't I be scared of losing you? Nothing's going to get lost. Nothing. Hold me? All that talk about German boats around us. Did you see any? Easy, Paul. Can your boat hold them all? Yeah. But not tonight. Elsinore's way up the coast. Is it more money? They take my boat, I lose my work. There are mines out there, so maybe I lose my life too. Look. There's no more money, and these people can't wait another night. Come on. Everybody's scared. 2:30. Be at the dock, and be quiet. She will sleep now. Is he coming with us? Get down. Take care of her for me. I will. God bless you, Neils. No more time, Jensen. May you be inscribed in the book of life. Thank you, Solomon. Get her down. I love you, Sara. I love you. Release the line. Let go, Neils. She's safe.
