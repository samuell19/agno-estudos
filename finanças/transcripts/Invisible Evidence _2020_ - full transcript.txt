Okay, I'm up! Hey, Tara! What time is it? It's 7 a.m. Let's go! Ben! Ben! -The students this year are quite good! -Yes, I think so, too. Feel free to ask if you have any questions. Sure. Good morning, Vu Hoai Thu. How are you doing? I'm doing okay. What are you up to? Sir, I've been studying the Braille System for the last three years. I can read, write, and use a computer efficiently. I've also been practicing martial arts. When I go out, I get help from Ben and my stick. To be honest, I don't feel any inconvenience. Sir. Please let me go back to school. 3 YEARS AGO Great job, Thu! Let's go. They invited and paid me to perform here. Don't worry about money. Let's go. You've been skipping class for a month, -don't you know you're getting expelled? -Let me go! I want to be expelled. I'm sick of school. Do what you want when you grow up. I am a grown-up. Hey… It hurts! You want violence? People are looking. No, they're not. Let's go. Just let me finish my performance then I will come with you. Let me finish. I… It's almost done. You have done this many times already. No! Thu! Let me go. You'd have your ass whooped if our parents were still here. You get whooped! I keep having to track you down and take you home, do you think I like that? Don't do it if you don't want to. Don't you have better things to do? You hardheaded dictator. What did you just say? I said you're a hardheaded dictator. Ignorant brat! Aren't you going to let me go? Are you? -Let me go! -It's dangerous! -Let me go! Now! -Ty! Come on! Let me go! -Ty, stop it! -Let me go! -I said it's dangerous! -Watch out! Thu, get up! Help me! Thu! Hurry up! I'm over here! Help me, Thu! Get up! Hurry up! Hurry up! Help me! Thu! Hurry! Thu! Ty! And those were the updates for the weather forecast. And now, we will move on to news regarding our social security situation. Police are warning young girls to refrain from going out alone at night to ensure personal safety. An investigation is being expanded regarding the mysterious disappearances of young girls recently. The latest victim is Ms. Trinh Thi Dan, 19 years old, second-year student with a French degree at the University of Foreign Languages. She was reported missing two weeks ago. According to our information, after her night shift, she didn't come home. If anyone has any information, please contact the closest police station. Get up for some porridge! You miss Mom and Dad? It has been three years, you should stop blaming yourself. I… My visa got approved. I see. Be careful with your steps. Thu… This house is really big and no one's living here. You rarely come too. How about we sell it? I won't sell it. Both Ty and I were born and raised here. My parents took care of every little thing in the house. I won't sell it. I just want to make sure things are in order before I leave. Thank you. But you don't have to worry about me. I will be fine. Those are probably Ty's friends. They're gathering here this year in memory of him. -Okay. -Let me have a look. Those darn neighborhood kids. They keep messing around. Hey! Are you leaving? Stay for dinner. The incense is still burning. I have to go. It's getting dark. Let me take you home. Day or night doesn't make a difference to me. -Let me call a cab! -Auntie! I can do it myself. Miss, we got your booking. But because of the heavy rain and traffic jam, would you be willing to wait a bit longer? Thank you. Our cab just arrived. Great! Watch it, you might fall. What? Are you coming or not? You're an hour late already. Damn jerks on apps. It is 9 p.m. Get in the car. Sorry. I made your car wet. No worries. It's because I was late. I'm glad that you came even if it's raining hard. Where do you want to go? Number 27 Binh An street, District 2, please. Are you cold? Let me turn the heat up. Thank you. Did your previous passenger work in a hospital? Pardon me? Your car smells like the hospital. I got the car from maintenance this afternoon. Maybe the smell of bleach is still there. Let me open the window. Don't open it. It's raining. I'm sorry, I forgot. Were you born like that? No. I was in an accident. I'm sorry. Have some water. Here. Thank you. You should drink it. I'm not thirsty yet. I'll drink later. Let me open it for you. Thank you. I can do it. I'll do it myself. -Let me open it. -I can do it, thank you. -Come on, I can open it for you. -I… -Give it to me. -I said I can do it. Let me open it. Did you hit someone? No. Just a dog. Get in the car, you'll get wet. No. Is the person okay? I told you already. I hit a dog. Get in the car, you're soaked. What are you doing? You're calling the cops? -What are you doing? -Get in. Anybody there? Anybody? Anybody there? You've been asking the same questions over and over again. Someone is in danger, and you're just sitting here asking me questions instead of investigating. Hey, you just heard me talking to the Traffic Department. There were no accidents reported at the location you mentioned. Then what am I doing right now? I'm certain it wasn't a dog. I swear I heard a woman groan. What time was it? About 9: 12 p.m. What? How do you know? You can't see… Because I got in the car at 9:03 p.m. Don't disregard my testimony just because I'm blind. Someone's life is in your hands now. -Calm down, please. -You're telling me to stay calm? Have you been writing down my testimony? No. You keep repeating the same questions like you are trying to make time for that guy to escape. Hey, what are you talking about? I would like to meet your boss. Hey, stop there! You are playing on your phone huh? Why aren't you working? No, I am working. I was just about to call you. This girl doesn't want to talk to me. She wants to talk to you. -Me? -Yes, boss. Hello. Hello. Ma'am. Here are the documents about the missing girls. Collect all documents of criminals relating to women in the last five years. Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry, Thu. Vinh didn't treat you well. It is late now. How about this? You go home and rest. We will get someone to investigate this case. I will contact you if we need anything else. Ms. Hoa. You have to investigate this case. Someone's life is at stake. How do you know my name? I can recognize your voice. I looked up to you when I was in the academy. I still remember your speech at the graduation. It was very enthusiastic. Thank you. -Please keep me updated. -For sure. Vinh, drive her home. It's late now. No need. Please help me call a taxi. No problem. He insists. Yes, boss. Your leg is not well, so you should be careful too. Goodbye. Sorry baby. I could have avoided you. It was all because of that blind bitch. NOTEBOOK FOR THE BLIND IF FOUND, PLEASE CONTACT THIS PHONE NUMBER Methods of negotiating with suspects in cases where… hostages are fatally injured. Who's there? -Hi Thu, it's Hoa. -I'm Vinh. Thank you. Thu. We already had someone check. You were right. No trace of any dogs. How are you going to find it if it wasn't a dog? Think about it. Dogs are usually shorter than humans. So when it's hit, the impact stays mostly low. And even if it hit the windshield, the contact area would be smaller. Do you remember if that car or the driver has anything unusual? Get in the car. I don't know what kind of car it was but it was a VIP taxi. The vehicle was high, and it was a seven-seater car. The driver is about 1.75 to 1.77 meters tall. His accent is a mix of Saigon and Central. If you still don't believe me, why did you even come here? No, I didn't mean that. -However… -Vinh! You are about 24 years old, around 1.75 to 1.77 meters tall. Your weight is about… 70 kilos. Right? Right? How do you know? The height of a person can be shown by the pitch of his voice and its starting point. About the weight, I can rely on the heaviness of footsteps and my intuition. We can learn a lot of things without actually seeing them. I think the driver knew I couldn't see anything so he lied in order to get away. With such a strong impact, the sound of a body falling down, it can't be a dog. Most importantly, I heard a woman's groans from the trunk. A woman's groan? Yes, exactly. Do you remember anything else? He is left-handed, as he wears a watch in his right hand. Usually, people wear their watch on their non-dominant hand to work easier. Can you remember anything else, like before the accident was there anything unusual in his car? That day… -You should drink it. -I'll drink later. -Let me open it. -Oh, don't worry about it. -Come on, I can open it for you. -I… -Let me open it. -I can do it, thanks. Let me open it. He forced you to drink? He insisted on opening it for me even though I said I didn't want it. Okay. We can stop here today. Thank you very much. I'll get the door for you. Hey, can I ask something? How did you know my leg hurts? Because your footsteps are unbalanced. Besides, the smell of ointment is strong! -Hello? -You brat, when are you paying me? You keep on delaying it. I will try to pay you next week. Pay me or pick your stuff up from the street! Hey! What? You have money? Can I borrow 2 mil? What? I have 200 thousand, not 2 mil. Boss! Say it. Borrowing money? Not really. I… Can I get an advanced payment? It's just March, but you already got your payment in advance for August. No way. The new version will be released at the end of next year. Another girl went missing. Ms. Tran Thi Thao, 23 years old. She's an office worker in Ho Chi Minh City. -This is what her family said. -Size 38. On March 8th, she said she's meeting some friends, -we waited but she never came back. -Socks? -Over there. -We've talked to her friends but they also have no clue where she is. We would pay anything just for any information about her. Has anyone come in since last night to fix windshields or hoods? No. Like they had an accident? Since yesterday, people came to change tires and mirrors only, no car seemed to have an accident. Thank you very much. -Hoa. -Yes? This is the list of all VIP taxi drivers, Grab, and franchised taxis in our city. There were more than 3,000 people. You said we need to investigate all left-handed drivers with a Central accent. New witness? You're really blind, huh? -Not pretending? -Hey! Watch your mouth. Are you sure? I'm 200 percent sure. I have perfect eyesight. Vinasun or Mai Linh taxis use Toyota or Hyundai. They never use an Audi. You seem to know well, huh? People said I'll be rich one day, so I should start looking into these cars now. What about app-booked cars? I'm the Grab master. I've never seen an Audi. Just because you've never seen it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. But I'm certain that it was an Audi Q7. Ms. Hoa. That night I called a taxi, he came and apologized for being late. Hey, you blind girl with good ears. You only know the tip of the iceberg. I swear. If I lied, I would let Grim Reaper cut my tongue. Who sold that phone to you? Do you know how to use it? Well… I look handsome. How about the license plate? Did you see it? It was so dark and rainy. Even if you had four eyes shining like headlights, you wouldn't be able to see it, how could I? If you witnessed that night, why didn't you inform the police? Because I was busy. And I saw him picking up the girl. I thought he was taking her to the hospital, how could I know? So let me ask you. Did the driver put the victim in the backseat or front seat? -The backseat. -Wrong! He put her in the trunk. Hey. Are you making things up for the reward? Lady! I might not have seen everything, but I told you everything I saw. I just want to do the right thing as a good citizen. And such good deeds… usually get rewarded. How dare you think about the reward? I said what I had to. If anything happens don't ever look for me. You brat! Talking like you can really see! Thu. You said the driver's accent is a mix of Saigon and Central, right? -Yes. -If I give you audio files, can you recognize his voice? Yes, I can. I'M COMING I'LL WAIT FOR YOU OUTSIDE -419? -AE3CE? Get in. Yes, boss? How is everything there? It's quite okay. Hey, draft a request and get Mr. Hung's signature to get a list of all silver Audi cars in our city and nearby provinces from the Vietnam Register. Oh, I thought… Remember to always have a backup plan. Yes, boss. CRIMINAL PSYCHOLOGY ANALYSIS In cases that have been studied, criminal acts, no matter how mysterious, still follow a set of rules. Violent criminals can be put into two categories. The first type carries out the crime based on a clear plan, arranging all details for the perfect execution. The criminal acts with a clear conscience and executes efficiently. Hello, who is this? I failed high school so I became a driver here. Life is hard nowadays, tourism is slow, so people don't take cabs very often. Hello? Where? Graveyard? Okay. On my way. I used to sell fish at the wet market. Now it's getting harder, so I switched to driving. Oh, my gosh, the first trip this early in the morning, I was paid in all small bills. It's so tiring already. Back when I was in first grade, we only learned the alphabet. A for Apple, B for Boy. Two or three pupils shared a book. Everyone was fine growing up. Now, there are too many changes. And all for nothing. That's all? Yes, that's all. His voice is deeper and less Central. Get out of here. You're driving me crazy. I'm only six months short on rent, why would you treat me like shit? Go live somewhere else if you don't have money. -Hoa. -Yes? There are very few girls on the criminal team. Why did you choose this job? Because I like fighting. Just kidding. I like investigating. I like solving crime cases. I like the feeling of handling criminals by myself. The harder it is, the more I like it. How about your leg? Why didn't you take joints tonic? Ah, well, this is just a work accident. I hurt my knee while working a case. But in return, a drug lord got arrested. So, it's worth it! It's not that bad. Still going strong. Actually, I appreciate it. Because every day, it reminds me to love other parts of my body. That's beautiful! I've never thought about it like that. Maybe you can't see, but I think you are very talented. Police don't always see the face of criminals. In such situations, we are no different from you. Sometimes, we can only trust our guts. -Hoa. -Yes? Can you close the trunk again? What? Can you close it more gently this time? Sure, give me a moment. That's the most gentle you can do? Yes. Otherwise, it won't be fully closed. What's wrong? Is there any other way? I don't think so. High-end cars have an automatic closing button that doesn't make much noise. That driver's car must have an automatic closing button. He didn't push as hard as you did. Yes, Vinh? Boss. I have contacted all taxi companies and Grab drivers that were at that location around the time Thu mentioned. I've confirmed this with all drivers and passengers. No one seems suspicious. Okay. Got it. We are in a maze now. Let me call Hai and ask him again. Yes, please. That brat! He blocked my number. Hello, Hai. It's Thu. Can you hear me? Hai? Hey, mister! Wake up! Is anyone there? -What's that? -Hoa! Help me! Help, please! He was hurt! -Oh, my god! -Help! He's very lucky. Look. He has no head injuries. That's great. How about everything else, doctor? Just a bit of bruising. But to be sure, we would like to keep him here tonight for observation. Have a drink. Thank you. One thing that had me wondering was that if that car wasn't a taxi, why did he let you in? Can you smell that? -You mean coffee? -No, not that. I meant this smell. The smell of antiseptic? Chloroform. It's chloroform. When I was in his car, I smelled this. He said it was detergent, so I didn't think much. I'm sure he put chloroform into the water bottle, that's why he insisted on opening it for me. You can't just buy chloroform. Maybe he works in the medical field? No matter who he is, there is nothing good about him. Hey, stop wasting my time. Don't ever contact me again. Maybe he must have thought I was the girl he talked to on a dating app. Dating app? Can it be a coincidence? Recently, we have been investigating a case about missing girls. Coincidentally, all these girls used a dating app. Oh, I forgot. Here. Last night this unknown number called me. But when I picked up, the caller didn't say anything. Can you check it? Vinh, check the number I just sent you. You're awake? How do you feel now? Do you feel any pain? Why are you here? What do you want? Well… You called me last night, right? If you hadn't called me, I could have escaped or even caught that guy. You're such a jinx. You ungrateful kid. Do you know who stayed all night to look after you? Thu did. Why? We're not related, she's not even my sister. Who said I lied and called me a scammer? Now you're pretending to be a good person? Being beat up doesn't make you more grateful. Hey, lady! What? You still have time to scold me despite being a detective? Did you catch the attacker? Don't be ignorant! That is my job. You don't need to tell me. Hoa, don't mind him. He's just a kid. Hai was right. I was insisting on being right and wrongfully accused him. -Take note! -Hai! I'm sorry. You can learn from her. Is something wrong? Do you need me to call the doctor? I'm thirsty. Hai got attacked because of me. I gave you the wrong information and made it difficult for you to investigate. How could a blind girl like me be a witness? I think it's best if I stop getting involved in this case. No, it is not that. Give me a moment. Got it. We've got a match. The owner of the number you gave me is Hoang Mai Anh, 20 years old. She is one of the missing girls. If I didn't have the information you provided, how would I be able to make the connection that fast? Ben. Ben. Why are you so noisy? Ben. Ben. What happened? What is it? I know who you are. No, you don't. You have no idea who I am. But I do know you well. By the way, I have a compliment for you. Your house looks very nice. Tidy. Clean. And you are very beautiful. Your skin is so smooth and fresh. You don't need to be that tense. But when you are… you look so beautiful. You better turn yourself in. It would be better for your case. That kid reminded you of your brother, didn't he? Three years ago, a student of the police academy, Vu Hoai Thu, left her shift and went to a bar to look for her brother, a promising young rapper. But let me tell you. That boy deserved to die. Those who are ungrateful and disobedient all deserve to die. Shut up! A sick, rotten guy like you has no way to escape. My girl is so strong. I'm starting to like you. What on earth do you want? What do I want? I want you to know one thing. If you keep messing with my business, I can't guarantee, nothing will happen to you. She's so annoying. Hai. Hai. Where are you? Listen to me. What do you want now? You have to stay here and wait for Ms. Hoa to come first. Why do I need to wait for her? The driver from that night recognized you. He must have been your attacker. Now he's stalking us. If you go out, you will be in danger. I must say you are really talented. You can't see anything, but you know everything. Trust me. Don't underestimate him. He likes playing chase. If you go out now, it's very dangerous. You must stay here. If you're worried about the hospital fee, I can take care of that. Or you can go to my house in the suburb and hide there for the time being. Wait until he gets caught, then do your thing. I don't need your help with anything. Leave me alone. Understood? Look at you. Who do you think you are? You can barely take care of yourself. Get off of me. Listen to me. Stay here. Hai. Hai. Guys. Guys. Hai. Listen to me, please. Don't go. Guys, please tell Hai not to go. Let's go. Hai. I had the worst luck this month. Don't worry. It will get better next month. Stay here. We'll get the bikes. Stop! Stop! Thu. Thu. Thu. Just listen to me, don't say anything. -Hai? -I told you not to say anything. Do you have earphones there? Put it on. I will video call you. What happened? Do it quickly. Hurry up! The guy who beat me the other night is sitting on the bus with you. Keep calm, don't say anything. Use your phone and film around. Go left. Go right. A little more to the right. HAI More! He is sitting on your right. Get off at the next stop. There are many people there. He won't make a move. I'm running after you now. Stay calm, okay? Don't hang up. Stop. Relax. Be quiet. I'm here, where are you? Hey, mister! Take me to the bridge, it's urgent. Hurry up! Hai! Hey! -Follow that bus! -Hop on! I'm here, where are you? Get up! Help! Help! Which way? Which way? There is a big road ahead, try to get there and ask for help. Help! -Straight? -Yes, straight. -Where? -Straight ahead! Oh, no! I was wrong. There are house lights on your right. Ben! Hurry up! -Which way now? -Three o'clock. -This way? -Yes! Ben. Ben. Ben. Keep running. There's a parking garage right in front of you. Where? -This way? -Yes. Hurry up! Your path is clear. Straight ahead. Keep going. There's an elevator ahead of you. Left side? Here? Ben. Ben. Watch out! Ben! My phone died. Drive faster. Hai? Hai? -Oh, my god! What is that? -Oh, my. Hey, miss. -Hey, miss. -Let me call security. Ty… Thu. Are you awake? Do you feel any pain? How do you feel? Where are we? We're in the hospital. Are you still hurt? Ben. Ben. Where's my Ben? Hoa. Where's my Ben? Hoa. Where's my Ben? Ben. Ben. Ben. That's Thu. It's him. -That's all? -Yes. I will call for support. Let's focus on catching this guy. Extract the videos from all the surveillance cameras -in Thu's path, -Yes, sir. -including private cameras. -Yes, sir. Search for more witnesses at the bus stop and residential areas. -Do it now. -Yes, sir. -How is it going? -Here, sir. Yes. I will need your help in this case. Yes, thank you very much. Could you please give me a full list of all-male medical staff who are left-handed, own an Audi car… The shoe size is 44. And with a shoe size of 44. Yes. I'll send the document over immediately. Yes, thank you very much. I had my guys check your house. I took all the cameras and changed the lock. We saw his shoe prints in your house. He's very careful. He didn't leave any trace. No mistakes. No fingerprints. AE3CE? Brother and three sisters? What does it mean? Boss. Mr. Thinh just sent me this. These are the two usernames the suspect used to communicate with two of the recently missing girls on a dating app. ABC145 and AE3CE. -Call Hoa right away. -Okay. Got it. Your location has to be turned on at all times. -Call me if anything happens. -Okay. We're going to catch this bastard soon. Hoa. Be careful. I know. Your brother's room is so cool. You can play the guitar? A little bit. How old are you, Hai? I'm 20. The same age as Ty. My brother. Thu, do you want to try skateboarding? I'll show you how. Put it away. Don't mess things up. I'm making dinner now. Why now? I will help you later. It will be quick. Okay. Let's go skateboarding. How can I skate? -Yes, you can. -No. Who knows, you might be good at it. Put your foot here. Okay. Use this leg to push. And when you're moving, put your other foot on the skateboard. Be careful! Not like that. Slowly. Are you okay? All right! Go on. What's next? Villa A15. At Happy Life Residence, District 2. The owner is Tran Nguyen Le, a well-known eye plastic surgeon. His girlfriend is Nhat Anh, a senior at Foreign Trade University. At first, she was his client, then they started dating. The strange thing is that there is no information about either of them recently. No phone usage history. No transactions on their credit card. All traces of them disappeared. I'll fix your left eye a little bit. I will make your eyes so unique. I already had the surgery. Once is good enough. But I want you to be beautiful. You have to be the one with the perfect eyes. Why didn't you ask if I wanted it? Trust me. Both of us want this. No. Only you want it. You are seeing someone right? What are you talking about? Why are you making things up? Don't think I don't know anything. Get off of me. Get off of me. Get off. Let go of me! You sick jerk! Who's sick, huh? -Who's sick? -Get off me! It looks abandoned. Is anyone here? I like to beat up the nosy ones. And I'll always beat up perverts like you. Mr. Hung. Please send a backup and an ambulance. I haven't had such a good meal in a long time. Hi, did you see Ms. Hoa? No, I don't. All the victims are alive. Hai? Hey, baby! Don't be afraid. Destiny brought us together. Ms. Hoa. Wake up! Go help Thu… What? Go help Thu and Hai! -Go help Thu and Hai! -Okay. Hoa! Hoa! -Please don't die. -Nonsense. Medic! I know. Nothing hurts the most more than killing our loved ones. Shut up! It's heartbreaking. But don't worry. I can help you. We can end this torment together. Thu. Hai. Call the police! Run, Thu! Hai. Hai. Hai. Are you okay? I can't reach Thu. No one answered. -Locate Thu's house, quickly. -Yes, sir. Get up. Hurry! Come on! Stay away from me. Drop it! Stay away from me. Hai. Women. You like to resist, huh? Hai! You like to be nosy? Okay. I will satisfy you. Get off of me! Get off! Thu! Thu! Thu! Help me! Help me, Thu! Hurry up! I'm over here! Ty! I'm nothing like you. I'm nothing like you! Hai! Where are you? Hai!
