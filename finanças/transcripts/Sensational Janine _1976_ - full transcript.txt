I'm feeling a bit nervous today. My wife's giving birth. Have you got any children? -No, I'm not married. -Nor am l. Work hard, Lili, won't you? Don't be like Mummy, bottom of the class. -I'll be like you when I grow up, Mummy. -Yes, sweetheart. Is that all you're eating? You'll never last the night on an empty stomach. Don't worry. See you tomorrow. What does Mummy do every evening? She works, Lili. Life is hard. Go on, get lost. You've got lovely eyes. Thank you. You're very kind. I'm not kind. What's your name? Janine. -What time do you finish work? -3 o'clock. -You're a hard-working girl. -I have to be. What about afterwards? -Do you always sleep alone? -Always. Pity. I might come back later. Fine. You do that. -Goodbye. -Bye. Poor old Hubert. Can you see me doing the cha-cha-cha? I did everything to make her happy. She washed my shirt once in seven years, and you should have seen it. That's awful. Seven years with one woman isn't bad. -Yes, you get attached. -I'll bet. -There'll be others. -Do you think so? -Are we playing billiards or not? -Yes. Your daughter's pretty. She's nothing like me. Do you have a photo of her mother? There's one at home. I'll show you sometime. -Whose turn is it? -Mine. Do you never see your little girl? Once a month, my wife's maid brings her round from 2pm to 5pm. She has a maid? Since we split up. Before that I was her maid. Here. Did she remarry? Not yet. She earns a good living. What does she do? She's in business. I'm playing a lousy game. Over there, Hubert. You need a good cue. That one was a real broom handle. -lf you like. -Then again, what's the point? You seem so sad. -I'm not sad. Leave me alone. -See? I was thinking about her. Tell me more about her. -What good will that do? -None. -All the same. -Honestly!. Lend me your comb. Think anyone would fancy me, looking like this? -I was hungry. -Eating takes your mind off things. Before I got to know you properly... ...you were always playing with that fat guy. I didn't like you. I don't try to please. -Can I have a paper? -Make that two. Can you pay for me? -Are you well? -Yes, thanks. -Sure? -Sure. Have you got enough cash? I have to read the news pages before I fall asleep. She's pretty. Forget it. She's taken. I've already tried. Her bloke must have it easy while she's at work. I'm sure. She earns a good living. I'm sure. -Shall we move on somewhere else? -Where? What I'm about to say will amuse you. I want to get married. It's all I can think about. You're mad. Every time I see a girl I like, I wonder if she's the one. You're completely nuts. It's a dead loss. Just before meeting you earlier... I was with a prostitute. Since then we've been walking and talking... ...I've been thinking about her... ...wondering if she's the one for me, and why not? -She'll be no better than the rest. -You have to try and understand them. They're all whores. It relaxes me. Don't get attached. -ls that what you think? -I'm telling you. -I need a woman. -Have several but don't get attached. You had a bad experience but let me at least try. They're all whores. Mine might be different. You have to work hard when you've got a wife. It's natural to work hard for the woman you love. -I'd like a wife who works hard for me. -And loves you? Not necessarily. -Maybe you were too good to her. -You're joking. I beat her. You didn't? -How? -With my fists. -I don't believe it. -That's the way I am. I'm soft or I'm hard, nothing in between. Understand? No wife, no children. I want children. -Why don't you adopt? -No way. Learn from my mistakes. -Aren't you glad you've got a daughter? -Yes. Well, then. Have you ever met a good woman? -Yes. -Who? -My mother. -Apart from her. My aunts never cheated on their husbands. How do you know? Apart from them? -Eh... -See? They're all whores. -You're obsessed. -What? Do you live in Strasbourg Saint-Denis? -Yes. What about you? -Me, too. -Whereabouts? -There. -What about you? -There. It's strange we never met before. Bye, then. -Bye. -And believe me. I believe you. It's cold. I'm glad to be going home. I'm going soon, too. -Bye. See you tomorrow. -See you. Give my love to your daughter. Good evening. You came back? Too late. The self-service is closed. I just wanted to take you out for a drink, or a dance. You must be joking. Go home to Mummy. -Save your money for next time. -I'm serious. I like you. -ls this a marriage proposal? -Why not? What are you doing here? You know each other? Is that the girl you fell for? She's not a whore, she's the queen of whores. I'll leave you men to it. Janine!. -Listen, Janine, I've got a job now. -Good. So have l. -Do you like living like this? -Very much. I love you. Leave me alone. I'm the queen of whores. And don't forget Lili's allowance this month. She must have loved you to stay with you for seven years. You'll get her back. You sure about that?
