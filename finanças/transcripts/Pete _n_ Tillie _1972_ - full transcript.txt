[BIRDS CHIRPING] [SERENE MUSIC] TILLIE: I wasn't looking forward to this party. Or meeting Pete Seltzer. But when you've reached my age and your friends are beginning to worry about you, blind dates are a way of life. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [DOORBELL RINGING] Hi, Till. - Hey. - Hi, Tillie. You see you've got a lot of attention. - Tillie! - Oh, hey, Bert. Well, you look great, baby, just great. Oh, thank you, I have a magic comb. I'll tell you what, uh, mingle for about 15 minutes then slip upstairs to my bedroom, I'll be waiting. Is Bert serious, or is he just trying to be a good host? Well, either way you're going to be disappointed. How would a wife know? How indeed. Mnh-mnh. Brava. Ah-ha-ha. There he is. Come on. - Hi, Tillie. - Hey, Trident. He's gruff. But he has a heart of gold. [LAUGHING] Pete Seltzer. - This is Tillie Shlain. - Hi. I'm gonna make a great effort to rise. No, please, don't get up. Oh, she's darling. But as I'm in need of a refill what can I get you, Ms. Shlain? Tillie. What can I get you, Tillie? Tillie doesn't drink. That's such a noble statement. I wish you'd let me make it myself. I'll get you some more of that. Now you sit down and chat. As long as Tillie isn't having anything I'll have a double, Gert. [GERTRUDE LAUGHING] Gertrude says chat, I guess we chat, right? Right. - Where were you born? - Why? No particular reason. Asking a person where they hail from comes under the heading of chat, right? Right. I hail from San Jose. I have to be honest with you that isn't much of a hail. No. Next time you're asked, say, oh, "Windyanapolis." - Alright. - Pete, booze. [GERTRUDE CHUCKLING] Incidentally do you always keep your arms folded across your chest? GERTRUDE: Here's your Scotch. I got you Coke, and drink up, the food is almost ready. Things are going beautifully, Gertrude. We're madly in love. [GERTRUDE LAUGHING] - Gertrude, my dear. - Oh, Father, you did drop. Oh, damn! There's Gert and her priest again. Oh, God, one of those. [LAUGHTER] - Good evening, Father. - How are you, Father? I think you know almost everyone here, Mr. Ford. I see Ed Ford every day in a week except Sundays. Sit down, Ed. And what about Pete Seltzer here? - Pete, Father Keating. - I don't believe we've met. - How do you do, Mr. Seltzer? - Hi. I didn't know you were asking, Father Keating. I demand equal time for my rabbi. Come on, Pete, you have one Jewish grandmother. You're three-fourth Lutheran. Why do you keep insisting that you're Jewish? 'Cause I'm a social climber. [LAUGHTER] Well, I don't think I'll bother with any more introductions. Father Keating knows how informal we are here. - Your usual, Father? - Thank you. Gertrude, you don't know how much I enjoy your parties. You know what I gave up to come here tonight? Bingo at the church. Incidentally, Father, is it true what I hear that the Bingo games at the church are fixed? Oh, well, I don't know exactly what you mean by fixed? I hear you let converts win, is that true? [LAUGHTER] Pay him no mind, Father. No, it's not true. But it's a marvelous idea, thank you. [LAUGHTER] World, world, world, world. [CHEERING] - The game over? - No. But having Father Keating act out God's in His heaven, all's right with the world seemed to me a little too much like ass kissing. Besides I don't think all's right with the world, do you? Um, not lately. Why does the clergy think they always have to play the good sport? Oh, please, don't interrupt. I'm pretending to be an animal lover. Hey, don't look so sad. You'd look sad too if you were just spayed. Oh, no, why'd they do that? Actually, I think it was her husband that Gertrude wanted altered but the vet made a mistake. Mes enfants, we need your help. We've had it with charades. We are about to embark on the great adventure. We are going to trap Gertrude into revealing her age. Why do you have to trap her? Why don't you just ask her? Nobody knows how old Gertrude is. Not even Bert, her husband. [CHUCKLING] Gertrude tells her age? She won't even tell us how old her dog is. Now, here's our plan. We'll just be sitting around casually and Heldon Pritcher will bring up John Kennedy. "Isn't he marvelous looking?" "Isn't he a marvelous president?" Et cetera, et cetera, and then, Tillie... That is your name, isn't it? But you just ask a casual question like, um, um, "Who was the first president you ever voted for?" And several people will volunteer information. And then it will be Gertrude's turn-- It won't work. That presidential ploy was tried on Gertrude years ago under Harry Truman, I think. You'll have to do better than that. Alright. Have you any ideas? Me? I couldn't care less how old Gertie is. How can you not care? Oh, such a big liberal. Such a big progressive. When it comes to something really important like Gertrude's age, won't lift a finger. [SIGHS] There are few burdens in life harder to bear than the irritation of a good example. That was rather good. "The irritation of a good example." Would've been even better had he bothered to give Mark Twain credit for it. Don't you know about Jimmy Twitchell? He's a cultural Robin Hood. He steals from the witty, and gives to the dull. Well, that's not so bad either. I'm 33, in case you're wondering. I figured somewhere in that neighborhood. [DOGS BARKING] Listen to them, I guess they haven't heard about her operation. I imagine they're just calling a spade a spade. You have possibilities. Thank you. After 12:00 we turn the clocks back tonight, don't we? Yes, we do. That's such a good idea, turning our clocks back. It gives us an extra hour of insomnia. Go on home, dogs. Shall we go? Oh, I have a car. Thanks just the same though. But I don't. - Don't what? - Don't have a car. You want me to drop you? No, no, no, I'll take you home, and I can get a cab from there or a cable car or something. After all, I'm your escort. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [TIRES SCREECHING] ATTENDANT: Thank you. You drive very well. Thank you. Gertrude says you work for an insurance company. Secretary. I think you're wondering how can she afford a car in San Francisco on a secretary's salary? Well, it isn't much of a salary, but this isn't much of a car. Oh, I see. What kind of work do you do, Pete? Motivational research. We send canvassers out to discover what the people think. - Think about what? - Products mostly. What they're looking for in the way of an automatic contaminator or, uh, an aftershave mint, things like that. Fascinating products. Anything else? Well, we've just completed a survey for a dietetic shampoo and are now helping to launch a reversible mayonnaise. Lovely. Say, maybe you could help us out. There's a new men's cologne coming out on the market. They're looking for a name. I suggested "Armpit." Did they go for it? No. And that, in case you're wondering, is why I have no car. I don't believe it, a parking space right in front of the house. [TIRES SCREECHING] You can get a cab a couple of blocks from here. Couple of blocks? What's the matter? Aren't you well? I woke up this morning with a touch of something, and I don't know what it is. Headache, upset stomach. But I was determined to keep this date... [MUMBLING] No fever, I can come in. [SIGHS] What's the sigh for? General world conditions. [CHUCKLES] [CARS HONKING] What do you think? I think, uh, you're a fine figure of a woman. I wasn't asking about me. I was asking about the apartment. Oh. Oh, it needs a man's touch. TILLIE: Incidentally for future reference no woman who fancies she has a good figure likes to hear she's a fine figure of a woman. The two aren't the same at all. What can I get you? What have you got? TILLIE: Well, I suppose there's some Scotch, or I could mix a martini or I could make some tea with cheese and crackers. Whichever is the most trouble. Scotch with water or soda? Tea is too good for you. Water. Good, I don't have any soda. I like this painting. TILLIE: I can guess which one. Do you know what I would call it? TILLIE: I'm afraid to ask. Overdeveloped girl from underdeveloped country. Thank you. Mm-hmm. What are you trying to do? Ply me with water? Pour in a little more Scotch, s'il vous plait. I don't have any more Scotch. La mere. No photo of father. He wasn't around long enough to have his picture taken. He disappeared 20 years ago. And mother alive and well, I hope? She's still looking for father. Says she'd leave him in a minute if she could locate him. You intend to look like your mother? I'll take what comes. Good girl. And speaking of breasts you wanna know something about yourself? Don't wear a girdle. I mean, give the rear bumpers a chance. I mean, you haven't got that much that you need to go around with it in a sling. Let it breathe. Same thing with the upstairs. You're the kind of woman who could go without a bra altogether, let alone folding your arms on top of it like an Indian. With sweaters and even the right dress let the merchandise gallop a little. When father was still around mother said she sometimes crossed the street just to avoid him. Or she'd flop into a closet as he passed her in the hall. You won't have to go that far. What are my chances of being mugged on the way to a cab? Bright. Could I phone for one? No, that would take all night. Would you like me to walk you to the corner? No, thanks, I'll take my chances. Thank you. Thanks for the water, and the Scotch. Siente. "To thine own self be true." That's a quotation from Lawrence Welk. [DOOR CLOSES] GERTRUDE: Did he ask for your phone number? I'm not at all sure I want him to call. [GERTRUDE LAUGHING] Well, what do you think of a man first time he meets a girl he says, "Give up the girdle, forget the bra?" [CHUCKLING] Well, there is a touch of vulgarity in Pete. Go a step further, call it crude. Well, Pete Seltzer has more redeeming qualities than any man I know. [CHUCKLES] Should a man need that many? You know, there was a technique used by a girl I know years ago. Very interesting. Man didn't call her, so she called him. Gertrude, I'm not calling Pete Seltzer. - Or any other man. - Please, let me finish. She calls this man, and she said, "After you left last night" "I found a gold cigarette lighter." Now, she didn't know such thing, of course. "It's from Dunhill's. Is it yours by any chance?" - Well? - Well. Since there was no lighter in the first place he said, "No, it isn't mine." "I wish I could afford a Dunhill." "Thank you just the same." Well, what did that accomplish? Well, for one thing, dummy, it established the fact that she was seeing a Dunhill kind of man. It reopened the lines of communication. He couldn't just hang up. Then he said before he knew what he was saying, "What are you doing Friday night?" And et voila. [SIGHS] - Call Pete. - Don't be silly. Just because it worked for you. Oh, must be after 2:00. Yes, it is, he's in his office. You go call him. You know the number? Look it up. Supreme Survey Incorporated. Go ahead. Gertrude. I am not that entranced by Pete Seltzer. Tillie, there are phones in the powder room. I didn't even notice if he smokes or not. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Uh, what happened, for God's sake? He's coming over tonight. Good, then it worked. Why do you look so furious? Why do I look so furious? Because I said to him, "After you left" "I found a gold Dunhill lighter." "Is it yours by any chance?" And that son of a bitch says, "Yes, I'll drop by tonight to pick it up." "Thanks a lot." Thank you a lot. [INTERCOM BUZZING] [INTERCOM BUZZING] Hello. May Allah smile upon you. I tried to call you at home, but you're not in the book. I have an unlisted number. I hate myself for it. Well, I wanted to save you a trip. I looked at the lighter again, and there were initials on it. - And they weren't mine. - Yes, how did you know? I suddenly remembered that I don't smoke. Well, why didn't you phone me? I never call girls whose numbers are listed. I hate myself for that too. Besides, I thought you might rustle me up some dinner. Oh, I don't think I have enough food for two. I could run down to the market. Don't bother. Do you like Greek food? Not particularly. Good, there's a place down the street guaranteed not to make you change your opinion. We can walk. I'll go get my coat. PETE: No, actually it could be any part of the city. Yesterday I was assigned Palo Alto, day before Berkeley. We don't wanna run into the same people asking the same questions. Where were you today? At the office, all day. Big conference, new account. Would you believe missionaries testing slogans for fundraising? Of course, my suggestion was turned down. I thought it was rather good. Take a cannibal to lunch. Vice versa would be even better. If you're trying to top me, you're gonna find yourself paying for the dinner. And it's every bit as indifferent as you said it would be. Why would we come here? Do you see that tiny man in the aisle there? That's Mr. Drogaris. He owns the joint. You notice anything strange about him? Just that he's obviously wearing elevator shoes. Is that it? Exactly. And it gives me an opportunity to say to my dates beware of Greeks wearing lifts. I hope you won't say that to me. I won't. You, uh, like Chinese food? And you know a place with pretty mediocre Chinese food, but there's somebody there or something that gives you a chance to get off what you consider a bomoh. Right. How, um... What's today? Tuesday. How about Thursday? Uh, busy Thursday. Friday? Friday fine. Mr. Drogaris? PETE: Um, thank you. Thank you. One of the most disappointing evenings in years. Something I said? Something I didn't say? The only reason we came here is because of Chang. He's my favorite waiter in the whole world. Every time he spills a plate of food or a bowl of soup all over you his look of oriental resignation is simply not to be missed. I mean, it's a classic. And tonight of all nights he doesn't spill anything. Chang, you're a disgrace to Madame Lee's Hanging Gardens. One thing puzzles me. This place is called, it says here, "Little P. King." Why do you keep calling it "Madame Lee's Hanging Gardens?" Where, for heaven's sake, are the hanging gardens? On Madame Lee, of course. Pay the check. Well, I suppose you can look at it at two ways. I could say, "Well, it's only been a week," or "For God's sake," "the whole week and he hasn't called." Now I don't know whether I'm sorry or not. Sometimes I think he's fun. Then most other times I think-- [INTERCOM BUZZING] Oh, hang on, Gert, the buzzer. - Yes? - PETE: Millard Fillmore. Oh. [BUZZING] Gert, he has ESP or something. Guess who just rang the buzzer? Right. No, I'm more surprised than happy. I'll-- I'll call you in the morning. Best to Bert, bye-bye. - Hi. - Well, come in. - How are you? - Fine. You were-- were just passing by and saw a light in the window. You're line's been busy for an hour. - Oh, I was talking to Gertrude. - I know, I called her. Her line's busy too. Have you had dinner? - Yes. - Good. - What'd you have in mind? - Oh... Movie and then a certain hamburger joint that late at night takes on a character all its own. Would you like a drink first? Oh, you've stocked up on liquor. Well, I wouldn't exactly call one bottle of Scotch and one bottle of vodka stocking up. No, thanks, I'll-- I'll have a beer with the burger later. - Any particular movie? - Just so it isn't a Western. TILLIE: I couldn't agree more. - Hi, Bing. - Hi, Pete. [OVERHEAD MUSIC] - Well. - Well, what? Where is this character all its own that takes on late at night? Look around you, what do you see? Another hamburger joint. What do you see? Look at all the couples at all the tables. Look at the way they're all huddled together. Isn't it plain as day they've all come here straight from the sack? It's this way every night, and it's what makes my suggestion to Bing over there so brilliant. Aren't you gonna ask me what the brilliant suggestion is? You'll tell me. I've been after Bing to put up a big new neon sign, "After Bangs, Bing's." I'll have the hamburger with cheese and a sliced tomato. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] How about coming up to my place for a spot of heavy breathing? Alright. [PETE WHISTLING] Such as it is. I can only repeat to you what you said about my apartment, "Needs a man's touch." Oh, that? A predecessor of yours. [LAUGHING] I'll take your coat. Think I'll whip us up a little antifreeze. Oh, milk for me, please. - You had milk at Bing's. - I'm an addict. Did you know that the American Indians never drank milk? Never had any cows either. I'll just give you that. [PLAYS SINGLE NOTE] Piano's out of tune. And it's gonna stay that way, thank you. Cheers. [SIGHS] How tall are you? Five-six, five-seven. Why? Well, I just read some magazine some place about a woman nearly seven feet tall. What about her? Well, naturally, she didn't like being nearly seven feet tall, so she had an operation. Sections of bone were removed from both legs about six inches or so, making her, reasonably normal height. I'm glad for her. Well, she was happy, the surgeons were happy, but they forget one thing. When she got up out of bed, her arms hung down to her knees. That's some story to tell a girl on her bridal night. [LAUGHING] You like ragtime? I'm not quite sure I know what it is. [PIANO MUSIC] Excuse me for a few minutes. There's more milk in the fridge if you want it. PETE: Tillie. Ms. Shlain, if you please. Would you like me to turn out the lights? You care to check your dress? Oh. - Allow me. - Thank you. [CHUCKLES] Tsk. What's the matter? Oh, I'm sorry, but it's terrible of me. But I have a feeling like like I'm being stripped for surgery. Well, why don't you look at it this way? Your silks are dropping like flags in surrender. That's so much better. [KISSING] PETE: You know, I think you're a very nice-looking girl. - TILLIE: Oh, come on. - PETE: No, really. PETE: Well, you're better looking than I am. TILLIE: Just. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] I made a small bet with myself that her arms would be folded across her breasts. Sorry. Sorry, is that all you have to say? No. If a while back I committed the gaucherie of saying I felt like I was being stripped for surgery, I would now like to add the operation was a success. Thank you. I'm still hungry. There's some salami and stuff in the fridge. I think I'll whip... - What? - Nothing. It's just that... Well, I was brought up on sex manuals, and they say that one is supposed to linger with soft endearments in what they call the afterglow. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] I just didn't think the first move was to the kitchen. - Endearments, eh? - Yeah. Very well. - Sweetheart. - Hmm. What would you like with your salami? Beer, tea, or milk? - Milk. - Right. You beat me by 14 pins. If you're not careful, you may sleep alone tonight. [PETE AND TILLIE LAUGHING] [MOANING] [METALS CLANKING] Oh, did I tell you that I was saving so much a week? - For a car of my own? - No. So you can buy the tickets tonight. One adult and one child. [PIANO MUSIC] Hey! Get yourself a new song or a new girl. [MUSIC CONTINUES] - What's that? - Hair pins. - I don't use them. - Neither do I. You have a cleaning lady come in, don't you? Once a week. Well, tell her to tidy herself up and not to shed her hair pins all over the place. Right. - What's her name? - Who? The cleaning lady. Would I ask a cleaning lady her name? Right. [MUSIC CONTINUES] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] I have news for you, Sister Tillie. You've changed your mind about scrambled eggs. No, I've been kicked upstairs. No longer do I have to spend my days on the streets button holding strangers asking them if they think "Shove It" is a good name for a new sanitary napkin. - No? - No. Now I can spend my days in an air-conditioned office collating and organizing data collected by others. In other words, I'm an executive. Well, I take it this promotion includes a raise. And I'm already spending it. Have my eye on a new Buick, or if that's still a little too rich for my blood, maybe a Chevy. When did you find out about all this? Last night. Well, why'd you wait till now to tell me? Because I wanted to make sure that you went to bed with me for myself alone, and not my money. Oh, I see. I wonder how much a new convertible would cost me? That depends on what they'll allow us on mine. The honeymoon's over. It's time to get married. [HORN BLARING] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] Pete. It's 2 o'clock in the morning, and we've already-- Listen to me, my girl. Let me tell you my theory about sex and marriage. It's like a medicine. Three times a day for the first week, then once a day for another week, and then once every three or four days until the condition has cleared up. Oh. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [YAWNS] Nine months to the day. It's so embarrassing. Me an incubator baby, I don't understand it. Seems we've spawned a giant. - Did you speak to the doctor? - Uh-huh. He's ten and a quarter pounds and twenty-one inches long. Well, if I've said it once I've said it a thousand times, you only get out of something what you put into it. [LAUGHS] ["COCKTAILS FOR TWO" PLAYING] ♪ In some secluded rendezvous ♪ Whoopee ♪ That overlooks the avenue [HORN BELLOWING] ♪ With someone sharing a delightful chat ♪ ♪ Of this and that ♪ And cocktails for two ♪ As we enjoy a cigarette ♪ To some exquisite chansonnette ♪ ♪ Two hands are sure to slyly meet beneath ♪ - Pete. - Yes. He's only 18 months old, for God's sake. - So? - So... Should he be subjected to those sounds? My dear, it's never too early to learn to appreciate good music. Oh, he's not gonna like this. [BABY CRYING] You see? I told you. Alright, alright. [MUSIC RESUMES] Pete, Pete. Come on. Pete. [LAUGHING] Stop it! [SCREAMING] No, Mrs. Seltzer, Mr. Seltzer isn't back yet. He must've left rather late. No, I think it was about 12:00 or 12:15. Well, I'll wait a few minutes. I'm going to catch the 3:30 ferry. Would you tell Mr. Seltzer? - Certainly. - Thank you. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [PIANO MUSIC] How'd you like it, Pete? The minute you play that better than I do, and I can hear that, that day is not too far off you pack your bags and leave. [CHUCKLES] Robbie, it's time for your bath. Not yet, not for ten more minutes. Better ten minutes early than ten minutes late. Oh, come on, Mom. Pete. Your mother is the highest court in the land, there is no appeal. - Put up your dukes. - Dad, what are you doing? Come on, jab, jab, jab. Through the right. [GROANING] TILLIE: Robbie, I'll be up in a minute. He's not a piano player, he's not a boxer. What is he? Any particular reason you wanted Robbie out of the way? Yes, this, uh, questionnaire from St. Andrew's School. - What about it? - Parents religious affiliation. I put down Congregationalists for me. - What do I do about you? - Put down headhunter. I think that's a religion, isn't it? Come on, Pete, what do I put down? You're Lutheran and Jewish. How about "Jewtheran?" Won't that confuse them? I sincerely hope so. Sorry I missed you today. You should call beforehand, so I'll know. Ms. Templeton said that you were in town shopping, which I hope means you haven't made anything for dinner. Is it too late for a sitter? We can go out. I left around 3:00. I saw you come in, or I think I did. I wasn't sure. Why the hell didn't you speak up? 'Cause I had to get home. Besides I couldn't be certain it was you. - How'd you like the package? - What? The girl I was with. Did you get a look at her? That's the one I was telling you about the other night or did I? Oh, the new girl. I believe you did say something about her. You're breaking her in as a canvasser or something. Yes, we're button holding people on the street these days getting their reaction to a new product. A fireproof pickle, I think it is. [CHUCKLES] - Pity you don't drink. - Yes, a pity. Did you take her to lunch, Pete? You bet your sweet little bundle I did. And don't think your correspondent wouldn't like to parlay that into a little hard breathing. But you know me. The ole louse manque. Not to first base. Aren't you ashamed, such a schlep for a husband? I suppose it reflects on you, but... Well, so what else was by you? Were the walls perpendicular today? Oh, I'm fine, except for this premonition of disaster. Oh, now don't tell me it's extrasensory perception time in Dixie again. Let me take you out of all this. There's a new French restaurant in the Chinese Quarter. ROBBIE: Mom. Okay. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Hello. - LUCY: Mrs. Seltzer. - Yes. LUCY: I'm afraid I'll have to introduce myself. I'm someone you don't know, but know of. - Oh. - LUCY: I'm Lucy Lund. Yes, I figured that. I called to ask whether you cared to sit down like two civilized people and talk the whole thing over. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] You must be Mrs. Seltzer. Afraid I am. May I have a martini? You may have anything you want, including my husband. One can't be more civilized than that, can one? Um, a martini for my friend, and I'll have a ginger ale. My husband. What on earth do you see in him? Well, do I have to tell you all his good qualities? I'd love it if you would. To begin with, he's amusing, good natured, generous, kind, a blast in his way, and... [CHUCKLES] Well... you must know this as well as I do, a pistol. A what? A pistol. Do you, uh, have an apartment in the city, Ms. Lund? Yes, uh, not far from the office, matter of fact. I don't mean to be cruel, Ms. Lund, but if all of us got together to talk things over, we'd have to rent a hall. I mean, you're just one of half a dozen or more. - Oh. - At least to my knowledge. Ms. Lund? My, uh, contact lens is in my martini. Oh, here. Thank you. Thank you. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] Is everything alright? Mm-hmm. [CHUCKLES] Where were we? Oh. What do you think, uh, is Peter's, uh, problem? [SIGHS] Well... he's not attractive to the opposite sex, so he's gotta make up for it by having so many of them, or he feels he has to. Well, men who are pistols, uh... are like that because they feel they have to be. They're afraid that, uh, at bottom they're not, and, uh, they have to keep proving over and over to themselves that they are. Beautifully put. Thank you. Would you care for another martini? No, thanks. Well, it's almost time to pick up my boy. Wait, um, Mrs. Seltzer, did you know he was like this before you married him? Certainly. Then why did you marry him? And why would you wanna stay married to him? Because he's a pistol. [SIGHS] Mmm. Oh, I thought it was you. Oh. I was just shopping. I bought bottles and bottles of vitamins. I don't happen to believe in vitamins, but there's a sale, and I happen to believe in sales. [CHUCKLES] - How's Robbie? - Oh, we don't know. - He's still in bed. - Uh-huh. What does Dr. Willett say? Oh, not much, but he's giving him a lot of tests and then he's waiting to hear from the lab. I must say, he doesn't seem very sick. Pete says there's nothing wrong with him that a good injection of chicken soup wouldn't cure. [LAUGHS] He says his Jewish grandmother cured every conceivable disease with chicken soup until she was arrested for practicing medicine without a license. Here's my car. I'd asked you about Gertrude, but I talk to her four or five times a day. Yeah, well, uh, last time I asked it was about six months ago, she was fine. I thought we'd talk a few minutes. - About what? - Oh, adultery, for one thing. Oh, anybody's in particular? Well, yours and mine, I was rather hoping. As you were passing by, you know, I just couldn't help noticing what smashing legs you have. Well, to the mother of a nine-year-old that is very flattering, thank you. But I don't think I'm quite ready. And when you are? You'll get every consideration. [CLANG] You know, if you're going to continue with this proposition, it'll cost you a dime. Not me. Have you had a good look at our garden lately? We're gonna have to do something about Vincent. Dr. Willett called. What'd he say? Did the test come back? - Yeah. - Well, what'd he say? He said he'd drop by for a drink on his way home, give us the report. Should be here any minute now. Well, why? Why didn't he give you the results over the telephone? Why is he coming over here to tell it? Oh, come on, Tillie. If you were married to Irene Willett, wouldn't you want a drink on your way home? Pete, I have the most awful feeling. Oh, stop it. What were you saying about, uh, the gardener? Oh, we're gonna have to let him go. Let him go? What are you talking about? He's got six kids. Apparently, those are the only seeds he can plant. [DOORBELL RINGING] I'll get it. - Hi. - Hi, Pete. - Tillie. - Hello, doctor. Can I get you a drink? I don't think I'll have a drink. Thank you, Tillie. Is that a new picture? Doctor, what'd the lab say? I'm afraid it isn't very good news. In fact, it's... quite bad. Quite bad or very bad? Very bad, Pete. Doctor, what's... It's in the blood stream, definitely malignancy. Are you certain? WILLETT: We've checked and double checked. Can't tell you how sorry I am. PETE: How long does-- does he have? WILLETT: Oh, I'd say about a year, probably less. There'll be periods of remission. May be comparatively fine. He can even go to school. We'll do everything we can to make him as comfortable as possible. And at any time don't hesitate to call me. Any time at all. Alright. Shit. Absurd. The whole goddamn thing is a scandal. ROBBIE: Mom! Business as usual. [PIANO MUSIC] Well, how about dinner, Rob? We're pushing the veal roast. What'd the doctor say? Well, he says your blood is homogenized or something, on account of that attack of the flu. [PIANO MUSIC CONTINUES] You need building up, is the main thing 'cause you're really rundown. Well, if you must know, it's something called "Postinfhienzal debility." It sounds like something Pete made up. The main thing is you'll be out of that bed inside of a week or so and then we can begin thinking about that trip. When is Pete's vacation? Oh, couple of weeks. Can be arranged as soon as you're well enough, and then the Sierras. How about that? [PIANO MUSIC] Pete never should've tried to expand his repertoire. We were all quite happy with "Piano Roll Blues," weren't we? [CHUCKLES] Such great songs the kids are writing today and you father comes up with "Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight." Rob, how would you like to take guitar lessons? - All the kids today-- - May-- maybe later. But I wanna stick to the piano, so I can play in a cathouse like Pete always wanted to. What is a cathouse? You know, place like a saloon or something where they stay up to all hours and raise hell. Playing all those jazz instruments that made caterwauling noises like a cat, that's where the term comes from. But if that's the kind of ambition your father inspires in his son it's plain to see who needs the discipline around here. Peter. Peter, would you step into the principal's office, please? [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [CAR APPROACHING] What's going on? TILLIE: Our neighbor Mr. Tucker is one of those nuts obsessed with the mileage he gets out of his car. Keeps meticulous records. So a couple of times a week Robbie and Pete sneak over there with a can of gasoline and keep filling up his tank, and poor Mr. Tucker keeps coming over boasting how he's getting 40, 50, even 60 miles to a gallon. Pete says he's gonna keep Robbie safe in a world of nonsense. No harm can come to him there. - Isn't this fun? - I don't know, Dad. Three hours, and we haven't caught one thing. That's what I mean. Isn't it fun for the fish? [LAUGHING] Hey, wait I think I got something. Steady, steady now. Steady, you got it, reel him in. - Wow, look at him. - Reel him in. You've got it. You've got a fish. Attaboy. What a beauty. Look at that fish. [CHUCKLES] Isn't he a beauty? Let him go, Pete, let him go. Let him go? What are you talking about? We've been standing here for three hours. Please. - Oh, he's hurt. - Alright, alright. I'll let him go. He's not hurt. He's bleeding. Doesn't feel anything, you know, fish don't feel. - He's caught. - Oh, don't squeeze him so hard. Who's squeezing him? I'm not squeezing him. Let's see, I think I've seen this fish before. There we are. Alright, goodbye. Just for that, young man, you're gonna have to have steak for dinner. [LAUGHS] Alright, Robbie. Easy does it now. Here we go, boy, easy. Alright, here we go, Robbie. [SIGHS] Attaboy. Here we go. ROBBIE: Can we put gas in Mr. Tucker's car? Tomorrow night, Robbie. I hate fractions. What's six divided by three fourths? That's your father's department. Pete. Six divided by what? Three fourths. Oh, that's easy. Here, let me have your thinking cap. Six divided by three fourths. Six times three, the numerator is 18 divided by four, the denominator, it's four and a half. Doesn't sound right to me. Well, thank you to show a little respect for your father. I'm not sure, but I think when you divide fractions you invert the denominator and the numerator, so that six times four is 24, divided by three is eight. How does that sound? It sounds much better, thanks. That's right, take you mother's side. All I do around here is pay the bills. Just once, I'd like to be treated like a human being. [DOORBELL RINGING] That has to be Tucker. [LAUGHS] You're gonna have to keep a straight face. Maybe you better go upstairs. Oh, no, Pete, please. Then hold it straight. [LAUGHS] - Tucker, how are you? - Hi, Pete. How are you? How's Mel? Oh, Mellie's just fine, thank you. Hi, there. I hope I'm not intruding. Sure you are, but come in anyway. Well, I thought you might be interested in this week's figures. - We are way back up again. - Great. You know, a few weeks back when I was down to 22, 24 miles a gallon? When we're all fishing the Sierras? Yeah, well, of course, naturally I thought the 40s and 50s I'd been getting was just a fluke. Last week, I averaged 44. This week 47. [ROBBIE LAUGHING] Have you ever thought of complaining? Complaining? Well, why should I complain? Well, such mileage, obviously there's something wrong with your car. [LAUGHING] [STAMMERING] He's stoned. ABBOTT: ...baseball team here at the retired actors home, and I am the manager. Now... COSTELLO: You're gonna be the manager of the retired actors baseball team? I would like to join the retired actors baseball team. - Oh, you would. - I would like to know... some of the guys' names on the team so if I wanna play with them I know 'um. If I meet 'um on the street or in the home here I can say "Hello" to them. ABBOTT: Oh, sure, but you know they give baseball players nowadays very peculiar names. COSTELLO: Oh, what are the funny names? ABBOTT: Well, let's see, we have on our team we have Who's on first, What's on second, I Don't Know's on third. - That's what I wanna find out. - The guys' name. ABBOTT: That's what I wanna find out, the guys' name. ABBOTT: I'm telling you, Who's on first, What's on second, I Don't Know's on third. COSTELLO: Abbott, you gonna be the manager of the baseball team? - You know the guys' name? - Well, I should. ABBOTT: I said Who's on first, What's on second, I Don't Know's on third. What kind of a way is this to spend a sunny Saturday afternoon? It's a history lesson, Mother. I want your son to know what comedy was like twenty-five, thirty years ago. Real comedy. Abbott and Costello? The Abbott and Costello "Who's On First?" routine is literature. It ranks with the Songs of Solomon, the sonnets of Shakespeare, and the speeches of Spiro Agnew. [HORN HONKING] ROBBIE: Who is it? - PETE: Look out there. - ROBBIE: Uh-oh. ROBBIE: Pete, it's Mr. Tucker. PETE: You ever see a more smug expression in your life? Yeah, listen, you two, you've gotta stop torturing poor Mr. Tucker. I agree. The time has come to reverse the procedure. Instead of putting gas in, we'll start siphoning it out. Instead of getting 40 to 50 miles per gallon he'll be lucky to get eight to ten. [LAUGHS] Oh, Pete, he'll go mad. I believe that's the whole point. I won't permit it. Mr. Tucker is our neighbor. - A nice, decent-- - I don't understand you. You-- you attack Abbott and Costello and you defend Mr. Tucker. - What's wrong with your mother? - Oop. Men. [LAUGHS] [SCREAMS] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [SPITS] What time is it? About 2:00. We're gonna have to face it. Dr. Willett says this remission can't last much longer. How can you think of that? [MUSIC ON TV] [MAN LAUGHING ON TV] Burn, Rome! Burn. MAN ON TV: If in the melancholy shades below, the flames of friends and lovers cease to glow. Yet mine shall sacred last... Lo, the blaze aspires! [TURNS OFF TV] MR. TUCKER: When I bought it, they guaranteed 30 miles per gallon, so don't tell me there's nothing wrong with the goddamn car. To go from 44 miles per gallon one week, to nine miles per gallon the next week. - But, Mr. Tucker, I checked it. - Don't try to tell me there's nothing wrong with it. There's nothing wrong with the car. I kept records on this car since the day I got it. The thing doesn't leak its own gasoline. - You don't believe me? - You know Pete Seltzer? When I bought it... [LAUGHING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] COSTELLO: Me being a good catcher, I wanna throw the guy out on first base, so I pick up the ball and throw it to home. ABBOTT: Now, that's the first thing you've said right. COSTELLO: I don't even know what I'm talking about. ABBOTT: What do I have to do? COSTELLO: You have to throw the ball at first base. - Yeah. - Now who's got it? - Naturally. - Sure. [ROBBIE LAUGHING] The guy who's playing on first base. - Naturally. - I wanna throw the guy out. - No. - So I throw the ball to who? ABBOTT: Naturally. COSTELLO: Throw it to who? [ROBBIE LAUGHING] Oh, you bastard. You bully. You butcher. You son of a bitch bloody butcher. You, Jesus. What's all this crap about mercy and compassion? Suffer the little children to come unto me. Suffer whose little children? [CRYING] Mary. Mary, where are you now? Mother of mercy. Mother of mercy. I spit on you! I spit on you! I spit on you! TILLIE: Later, of course, I recoiled in horror from the memory of it. Was it I saying those things? Robbie left us in the dead of winter. I'd like to stay a moment. [SIGHS] What do you think, should we have some kind of service? The church bit? Not the usual, but something. Not for you, not for me... for Robbie. Play it safe, you mean. I haven't been in a church maybe 20 years. Me neither. MINISTER: At the request of the parents, Mr. and Mrs. Seltzer, I will read from the works of the poet Robert Louis Stevenson. "Purge out of every heart the lurking grudge." "Give us courage, and gaiety," "a quiet mind." "Spare us to our friends." "Soften us to our enemies." "Bless us if it may be in all our innocent endeavors." "If it may not be..." TILLIE: For almost six months we lived practically alone. I was content in seclusion. But then friends coaxed us out to a cocktail party. Pete quickly accepted before I could say no. Excuse me, please. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] PETE: No, I'll tell you... I'll tell you why I'm not in the stock market. The lady will have a Coke, and I'll have a Scotch. PETE: I just read where the president of Anaconda Copper heard about Tijuana Brass and he wants to arrange a merger. [LAUGHING] - No, really, I'm serious. - Excuse me, Father. - Tillie. - Hello, Bert. - Mm. You look marvelous. - Where's Gertrude? Oh, she's visiting her mother in Minneapolis or someplace. How's Pete? In there talking to that redhead. Why don't you ask him? I don't ask men how they are. But that redhead's another proposition. [LAUGHING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] She says she's visiting her mother in Minnesota, but she's off someplace having a face lift. - WOMAN: Again? - JIMMY: Yeah. JIMMY: I hear she has the surgeon on a retainer. I had this new secretary who called me Pete. We had a couple of lunches, and she started calling me Mr. Seltzer. I said, "Hey, you used to call me Pete." But she says, "That's before I got to know you." [LAUGHS] She had the largest-- Pete, I'd like to go now. The invitation said 5:00 to 8:00. But it's only 9:00. Pete. Sure. Think I can still catch the second half of that football game. Would you fix me a drink, please? Alright. MALE ANNOUNCER: Mississippi 48 or 49. So with two minutes and 15 seconds to go in the half Mississippi takes over on zone 48. They're lining up with two tight ends. Here's the snap. Whoops. Looks like a busted play. Somebody got their signals crossed. Mississippi is calling a timeout. [PETE SIGHING] Up to the line of scrimmage without much more. MAN ON TV: See where the referee puts the ball in. Thirty-three. That makes it thirty-three. Thank you. Who's playing? Mississippi, Mississippi State. You mean you care which one of them wins? I don't care, not the slightest. Then why are you watching? Honey, I'm just gonna sit here and hope for injuries. We should've stayed at the party. I was getting more laughs there. [CHATTER ON TV] You know, Gertrude's been after me for quite some time to talk to Father Keating. About what? You think he'd try to proselytize me? Wouldn't be surprised. Well, would it bother you? Well, I mean, suppose Father Keating succeeded? Suppose I... I believe the expression is "Embrace Catholicism." Alright, embrace Catholicism. Would it bother you very much? Not particularly. But tell me something. You've never been much of a Congregationalist. What makes you think you'd be a better anything else? I don't know. I don't know. But I need somethin'. You're gonna laugh at me, but... At 4:00 or 5:00 every morning when I'm lying wide awake, I keep thinking... a nine-year-old boy dies... needlessly, senselessly, is it a punishment? Are we being punished for something? Punished by whom? Don't make it so tough for me. You know damn well by whom. Alright, I know damn well by whom, but for what, for Christ's sake? I don't know for what, and I'm sure you don't either. And Father Keating does? Well, at least he'd be willing to discuss it seriously. And so would I! Take you, for example. I think you can be classified as what is known as a good person. Oh, you're a little rough on redheads at parties. - But all in all... - Pete. Now take me, I'm not so bad either. Oh, I admit to a few flaws, but not many. Pete, shut up. So I put it to you, Tillie, that our poor darling baby died, not because of retribution divine or otherwise, but simply because some goddamn bug got-- You want me to scream? I leave it up to you. Always a little joke. Anything to hide your true feelings. Let me tell you something about true feelings. I've made quite a study of true feelings. Most of them deserve to be hidden. [FOOTSTEPS] I suppose I should be grateful you did deign to discuss it, that's something. Anything disturbs you, you keep it to yourself. Clam up. If something bothers me... I know, I know, it makes you feel better to talk about it. Well, it makes me feel worse. God, how have we ever stayed married for 11 years? Because I'd rather not discuss things with you than with any other woman in the world. I'm going to bed. You have my very best wishes. I just saw a film of rare beauty on the late, late show. Tarzan was complaining to his buddy the ape about his sex life... Tarzan's, not the ape's. Which reminds me, we should be celebrating an anniversary pretty soon. It's been almost a year since you and I-- You're smashed. Possibly. I'll bet you've killed conservatively half a bottle. How does one kill conservatively? I can see killing madly, angrily, indiscriminately, mechanically, but conservatively? Goodnight, Pete. Expect I'll be home late again tomorrow night. Some reports to rush out to some poop in South Jesus Idaho somewhere. Stay in town all night if you want. I mean, I don't mind. Even if you've got somebody. You've gotta live, I know. I have no right to starve you just because I've lost my appetite. No comment. TILLIE: Pete's taken a one room apartment in town someplace, so a shrewd guess would be that we're separated. [SHIP HORN BLARING] And I hear Gertrude has talked you into heading the raffle committee at the mental health ball. Oh, yeah. [LAUGHS] Gertrude says I'm a bitch, but she's still allowing me to arrange for my dear friend, Princess Grace, to receive the first prize winners at the castle in Monaco. You may be a bitch, but to the rest of the community you're worth all the husbands in town. Yeah. Well, none of them ever lifts a finger to help out with any of the charities. Have you ever refused a request? I adore the limelight. Hmph. Well, anyway, I'm going to the police department tomorrow with Laura Colton to register the lottery. It's a state law or something. Certainly is. And you're not going with Laura Colton, you're going with Gertrude Wilson because among the routine questions the police will ask you is your name, your address and your age. Oh. [LAUGHS] Poor unsuspecting Gertrude. After all these years, we finally have her. Heh. She may be able to slip and slide her way out of telling us, but the police, no way. I can't do that, Jimmy. I can't do that to my best friend. But, darling, what are best friends for? No. Well, [CLEARS THROAT] I've saved my trump card for the last. Laura Colton has the flu. I know. I gave it to her. [CHUCKLES] GERTRUDE: What do you hear from Pete? TILLIE: Well, I haven't. 'Course, he could've called while I'm out. I've been out a lot lately thanks to you and your lottery. Listen, Gert, you don't have to register with me. Oh, well, we need two committee members, remember? And I don't mind. Well, I can wait for Laura. She'll be fine tomorrow. No, let's get it over with. Speaking of getting things over with, have you seen a lawyer? About what? About what? The divorce. What divorce? Yours and Pete's. What have you done about it? Have you seen a lawyer? No, I haven't seen a lawyer. I don't even know a lawyer. Well, I know lots. Well, I'm not quite sure I'm ready to. Well, you can get it on adultery. I know that. Well, if you know that, I must know it too. No, if you want me to, I'll testify at the trial. I couldn't put you to that trouble. Oh, listen, my girl, I got you married. The least I can do is get you divorced properly. Now, call this lawyer I know. He's marvelous. He handles all your friends' divorces, does he? I don't get a commission, if that's what you mean. Ah, here we are. MAN: Organization? GERTRUDE: Mental health. Prize? GERTRUDE: An all-expense trip to Monaco. A day's hospitality with her serene highness, Princess Grace. Uh, total monetary value? Uh, approximately then. I just have to put something down here. About a $1,000. - Price per ticket? - Uh, $20 apiece. We're planning on selling 250 tickets. Very well. Now, I've gotta ask you to swear to all this identification with the required vital statistics. - Your name? - Gertrude Wilson. Address? Uh, 210 Chestnut Drive. Age? Age? Um... [CLEARS THROAT] [STAMMERING] [STAMMERING] Take your time. We get this all the time, but it can't be helped. Do you wanna try again to state your age? [CHUCKLES] [STAMMERING] She's dead. I always knew this would happen. Oh, you did this deliberately. You planned it deliberately! I'll never forgive you for that. But it's true, you're a bitch. - Who's the bitch? - You. Prove it. I don't have to prove it, everybody knows it. It's like two and two are four. You are a bitch! [SCREAMS] [GRUNTS] [SCREAMS] [SIGHS] [BOTH GRUNTING] [GROANING] No wonder your husband left you. You dried up old hag! [GRUNTING] [SCREAMING] Stop! [SCREAMING] [TILLIE LAUGHING] Stop! [GRUNTING] [SCREAMING] TILLIE: No, no! [GROANING] [GRUNTING] [SCREAMING] TILLIE: So, Gertrude, age still unknown is in the Bahamas for a much needed vacation, and I'm here in this so-called rest home trying to pull myself together. And Pete... Who knows where Pete is. [KNOCK AT DOOR] Come in. You have a visitor, Mrs. Seltzer. Jimmy. Oh, [CHUCKLES] must they throw a pistachio at you at this hour of the day? Couldn't they wait until evening? Heh. You smell better than your flowers. My dear girl, I am going to get you out of this if it takes a letter to Washington. [CHUCKLES] Well, ah, may I sit down in one of your chairs? Mm. From what mortician were they rented? [CHUCKLES] [SIGHS] Last time I was in a room like this was when I visited an old aunt of mine in Chicago. She was nearly 90 then. And it has long since been torn down, but no matter. [SIGHS] Well, pit. This is going to give mental health a black eye. For a long time, I had two. It was all for nothing. I never did find out how old she was. Well, while she's in the Bahamas I'm spreading the word that she's 53. Let her straighten us out when she gets back. [CHUCKLES] But to hell with Gertrude. I wanna talk to you. You'll, um, forgive my prying, darling, because I'm interested. But your marriage is definitely over, isn't it? Or, um, se fini nes pah, to put it more elegantly. I guess it is. Right. Now, I shall proceed to astonish myself. Why don't you take a whack at it with me? Ah, you could do worse. Indeed you already have. I've never married. Not for lack of opportunities. I've had several propositions in my time. Some of them from women. I'm healthy, solvent and amusing. I shall never beat you. I'm not that interested in women. And I shall make you chic. I'll dress you from head to foot. I'll do something with your hair. I'll make you over, because you do have possibilities. There'll never be a dull moment. We'll see all the shows. We'll travel abroad once a year always eating at least as well as at home because flanking my cookbooks is a shelf full of eating guides beginning with the Michelin. Pete always called them "Belly Baedekers." Please not while I'm proposing. Well, you'll find everything a woman can reasonably expect in this world. Food, shelter, clothing, and... a sort of a husband. Oh, my mother. I have a mother someplace. This will sum up my mother for you. She'd vote for Ronald Reagan for president because any man who had both legs amputated, as he did in that movie that keeps being reshown, and then went on to become governor of California, deserves our admiration. We'll see her once a year. And we'll phone her every Christmas Eve. Well, I guess that just about wraps it up. Done and done. Goodbye for the present. Now, I must go and prattle about us. Jimmy. Could we make it our secret for the time being? Of course, else what would there be to prattle about? Don't breathe a word. One busybody in the family is enough. Hello, Mrs. Seltzer. Hello, Pete, how are you? What the hell are you doing here in Disneyland? [CHUCKLES] I don't even know for sure. Are you keeping busy? How are things in town? Well, you know, San Francisco this time of year. Crawling with Americans. Why didn't you call a man? I looked in your room, I noticed your bags were packed. Yeah, I'm leaving. I was just taking a last little walk. Listen, Tillie, we're going to have to be strong. We're going to have to face the cold hard facts. This separation of ours, it just isn't working out. I mean, my plumber tells me that the pursuit of women is flight from woman. What does that mean? What the hell do I know, am I a plumber? WOMAN: Come on now, cool it. You can't run around in here like that. Come on. Hey, kiddo, that's-- Oh, I'm-- I'm sorry. Now, that was very rude of you! You mustn't run in between people like that. CHILD: Who cares? WOMAN: Oh! I care! You've gotta be polite! You know, this is the first time you've ever cried for Robbie. [SNIFFLES] Not quite correct. The first time I've ever cried aloud. Oh, God, Pete. When I think of all the wonderful things you never said to me. You should've heard them anyway. Yeah. I suppose there was a lack in me somewhere. [SIGHS] When I think of all the times I was so irritated with you... and yet right now, I don't think I've ever loved you more. Well, love without irritation is just lust. Not that there's anything particularly wrong with lust. [CHUCKLES] I just realized something about you, Pete. I tried for years to put my finger on what was wrong with you. What your faults were, your flaws. And now it's come to me. You have no faults at all. You're just hopeless. Did you drive up? Car is up front. Your bags and coat are already in it. Oh. [CHUCKLES] What's so funny? Oh, I was just thinking. Thank God I have Pete Seltzer to see me through the disillusionments of a marriage. I like your attitude, Mrs. Seltzer. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [SERENE MUSIC]
