OF COURSE YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE CARE OF IT. IF WE GET A TRAFFIC TICKET, THE OTHER DRIVER HAS GROUNDS TO SUE. ROMANIAN STEAK ? ROMANIAN STEAK, FRIED POTATOES, CARROTS AND CAULIFLOWER. CAULIFLOWER, CARROTS, CAULIFLOWER: DON'T YOU GET TIRED OF THE SAME CHAZZEREI ALL THE TIME, YEAR IN, YEAR OUT ? WHY DON'T YOU TRY SOMETHING NEW FOR A CHANGE ? DARLING ? MINE'S OKAY. YEAH ? HOW DOES IT LOOK, A JUDGE'S CAR IN VIOLATION ? YOU WERE DRIVING IT AND YOU HAD TO ARGUE THE LAW WITH THE OFFICER. HE WAS RUDE. HE WAS RUDE AND HE USED LANGUAGE THAT HE SHOULDN'T HAVE USED TO THE WIFE OF A JUDGE. HEY, YOU, WAITER. I CAN'T EAT THIS. SEND IT BACK. WANT SOMETHING ELSE, DARLING ? YES. HE HAS HIS OWN REUBEN SANDWICH. HE CAN'T EAT THIS. TAKE IT BACK. BRING HIM A BREAST OF VEAL ? BRING HIM A BREAST OF VEAL. HOW WAS THE OFFICER TO KNOW THAT YOU WERE THE WIFE OF A JUDGE ? SHE TOLD HIM. YOU TOLD THE COP THAT I WAS A JUDGE ? I AM YOUR WIFE. HE SHOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ME A TICKET. HOW DOES IT LOOK ? OH, AL, MAKE A CALL. DORA, LISTEN TO ME. IT IS A VIOLATION OF JUDICIAL ETHICS FOR ME TO INTERFERE. IT'S DISHONEST. AL... I AM FIRM ABOUT THIS. LOOK AT THE WAY YOU TALKED TO THAT WAITER. HMM ? IF YOU HAVE FRIENDS INSTEAD OF ENEMIES, YOU'LL NEVER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT YOUR BACK. GET THE POINT ? YOU'RE A MAN WITH POWER WHO WON'T EVEN USE IT TO PROTECT HIS OWN. LOYALTY. LOYALTY. DOES THAT WORD MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU ? YOU'RE TELLING THIS BOY HOW TO LIVE ? YOU ARE ? THAT'S THE IDEA. DON'T. HE'S MINE. THIS IS ONE BOY THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO FORGET. WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE JUDGE ? ( slow instrumental music ) ( narrator ) THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF THE UNITED STATES IS A FIFTH COLUMN IF THERE EVER WAS ONE. IT IS FAR BETTER ORGANIZED THAN WERE THE NAZIS IN OCCUPIED COUNTRIES PRIOR TO THEIR CAPITULATION. THEY ARE SEEKING TO WEAKEN AMERICA JUST AS THEY DID IN THEIR ERA OF OBSTRUCTION WHEN THEY WERE ALIGNED WITH THE NAZIS. THEIR GOAL IS THE OVERTHROW OF OUR GOVERNMENT. THERE IS NO DOUBT AS TO WHERE A REAL COMMUNIST'S LOYALTY RESTS. THEIR ALLEGIANCE IS TO RUSSIA, NOT THE UNITED STATES. THE COMMUNISTS HAVE BEEN, STILL ARE AND ALWAYS WILL BE A MENACE TO FREEDOM, TO DEMOCRATIC IDEALS TO THE WORSHIP OF GOD, AND TO AMERICA'S WAY OF LIFE. I FEEL THAT ONCE PUBLIC OPINION IS THOROUGHLY AROUSED, AS IT IS TODAY, THE FIGHT AGAINST COMMUNISM IS WELL ON ITS WAY. VICTORY WILL BE ASSURED ONCE COMMUNISTS ARE IDENTIFIED AND EXPOSED. ( Adolphe Menjou ) THIS IS A FOUL PHILOSOPHY, THIS COMMUNISTIC THING. I'D MOVE TO TEXAS IF IT EVER CAME HERE BECAUSE I THINK THAT TEXANS WOULD KILL THEM ON SIGHT. ( laughing ) ( questioner ) YOU REFUSE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION? ( witness ) I'LL HOLD UP MY BELIEF MY AFFILIATIONS AND EVERYTHING ELSE TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. THEY'LL KNOW MY STANCE AS THEY DO FROM WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN. I'VE WRITTEN ABOUT AMERICANISM FOR YEARS AND I'LL CONTINUE. ( questioner ) STAND AWAY FROM THE STAND ! I AM NOT AND NEVER HAVE BEEN DISLOYAL. I AM NOT AND NEVER HAVE BEEN A COMMUNIST. I AM NOT AND NEVER HAVE BEEN A SUPPORTER OF A MEMBER OF, OR A SYMPATHIZER WITH ANY ORGANIZATION KNOWN TO ME TO BE OR SUSPECTED BY ME OF BEING CONTROLLED OR DOMINATED BY COMMUNISTS. THERE IS NOT A COMMUNIST BONE IN MY BODY. I HAVE NEVER READ KARL MARX AND I DON'T KNOW THE BASIS OF COMMUNISM BEYOND WHAT I'VE PICKED UP FROM HEARSAY. FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD, I DON'T LIKE IT, BECAUSE IT ISN'T ON THE LEVEL. ( radio announcer ) Communism in reality is not a political party. It is a way of life: An evil and malignant way of life. It reveals a condition akin to disease that spreads like an epidemic. And like an epidemic a quarantine is necessary to keep it from infecting this nation. ( man ) IF I HAD MY WAY, THEY'D ALL BE SENT BACK TO RUSSIA OR SOME OTHER UNPLEASANT PLACE. ( applaud, gavel banging ) ( woman's voice ) DR. SANFORD, PLEASE COME TO THE 3RD FLOOR FAMILY CONFERENCE ROOM. DR. SANFORD, PLEASE COME TO THE 3RD FLOOR FAMILY CONFERENCE ROOM. ( Cohn groaning ) NURSE. ( beeping ) ( nurse 1 ) DOCTOR !

THEY WANTED TO MAKE SURE HE WAS DEAD. THE BLOOD GAS DOESN'T LOOK TOO HOT. I NEED A FACEMASK OVER HERE ! DID YOU KNOW THIS GUY ? ROY COHN ? WE KNEW HIM ALL RIGHT. JOE McCARTHY'S STRONG RIGHT HAND. OXYGEN, 4 LITERS. ( young doctor ) MY FATHER SAID I REMEMBER HIM SAYING THAT. GREAT PATRIOT ? ( young doctor ) THOSE SPIES, THE ROSENBERGS, HE GOT THEM EXECUTED. $20 SAYS THE GREAT PATRIOT DOESN'T MAKE IT TILL DAWN. AAH ! FUCK YOU ! I DON'T NEED YOU. I DON'T NEED ANYBODY. ROY COHN CAN TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF. I TOOK CARE OF THE FUCKING ROSENBERGS. ALL RISE. THE JUDGE IS THE HONORABLE IRVING KAUFMAN. BE SEATED. JULIUS AND ETHEL ROSENBERG, APPROACH THE BENCH. ( judge ) YOU STAND CONVICTED IN THIS COURT OF GIVING TO RUSSIA AMERICA'S ATOMIC SECRETS. IT IS NOT IN MY POWER, JULIUS AND ETHEL ROSENBERG, TO FORGIVE YOU. ONLY THE LORD CAN FIND MERCY FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE. THE SENTENCE OF THE COURT UPON JULIUS AND ETHEL ROSENBERG IS THAT FOR THEIR CRIME, THEY ARE SENTENCED TO DEATH BY ELECTROCUTION. ORDER IN THIS COURT ! I LOVE YOU. WE MUST BE STRONG FOR THE CHILDREN, ALL RIGHT ? ORDER! ORDER IN THIS COURT ! BAILIFF, TAKE THAT MAN OUT ! SILENCE OR I'LL HAVE YOU REMOVED. BAILIFF ! SILENCE !

THE BASTARDS DIDN'T MAKE IT, THOUGH. WHAT DO YOU SEE THERE ? YOU SEE THE SUN ! THEY HAVE THIS ONE DOCTOR. THEY PAID HIM TO KILL ME. THEY COULDN'T DO IT-- I DON'T THINK SO, ROY. THEY GOT HIM TO DO IT. YOU DON'T THINK SO ? YOU HATE ME NOW, TOO ? MY FRIENDS AND MY ENEMIES HATE ME, YOU HATE ME, EVERYBODY. YOU KNOCKED OFF YOUR ENEMIES LONG AGO. YOUR FRIENDS LOVE YOU, YOU KNOW THAT. ARE YOU TRYING TO MAKE ME FEEL GUILTY ? I GAVE UP ON THAT ONE, DEAR. WHAT IS THIS-- NO, NO. IF YOU LOVE ME, YOU'LL HELP ME FIND MY CLOTHES. YOU'LL GO A LONG WAY TO FIND A BETTER FRIEND THAN ME. GET BACK. WE'LL FLY BACK. WE'VE DONE THIS BEFORE. GET OUT OF MY WAY. ( nurse ) PLEASE, MR. COHN. PLEASE GET BACK INTO BED. ( Peter ) JUST GO BACK TO BED. OH...PETER. ROY. AAH...AAH. PLEASE. PLEASE. PLEASE. IT'S ONLY GOING TO HURT MORE THIS WAY. HELP ME ! HELP, PLEASE ! I DON'T KNOW YOU. YOU'RE NOT ON MY LIST OF VISITORS. GET AWAY ! I DO THIS AT HOME. I'M GOOD AT IT. I KNOW WHO YOU ARE. YOU'RE THE ANGEL OF DEATH, BUT YOU'RE NO FUCKING ANGEL ! YOU'RE DEATH ! GET AWAY FROM ME ! NO...NO ! ROY. YOU KNOW WHO I AM. YOU KNOW I'D NEVER HURT YOU. YOU KNOW WHO I AM. ROY ! YOU CAN'T KEEP ALIENATING EVERYONE WHO TRIES TO HELP YOU. EVENTUALLY, A PERSON JUST SAYS TO THEMSELVES: "I DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THIS, NOT EVEN FROM ROY COHN." ROY. YOU'RE GOING TO END UP ALL ALONE, LOVE. PLEASE-- ANGEL OF DEATH. JUST RELAX. RELAX AND TRY AND STAY STRONG. AAH...STRONG ? I NEED TO FIGHT SOMEBODY TO STAY STRONG. GET OUT ! FIGHT THE DISEASE, NOT YOUR FRIENDS. WHAT DISEASE ? I DON'T HAVE A DISEASE. OH, PETER... DON'T LET THEM DO TO ME WHAT THEY DID LAST NIGHT. OKAY ? ALL RIGHT. YOU'LL BE OKAY. YOU'LL BE OKAY. I'LL FIGHT THIS THING ALONE NO HELP. I DON'T NEED THEIR HELP. IF I DIE, I DIE. BUT I WON'T. RIGHT ? RIGHT, LOVE. SLOW DOWN. STOP EATING ME. ( slow instrumental music ) SO HELP ME GOD. I REMEMBER. DEAD. HOW COULD I FORGET ? I KILLED YOU, SPY. WAS I ? YOU'RE NOT REAL. WHY AM I TALKING TO YOU ? PETER ? SPY. WAS I ? OR DID YOU JUST MAKE IT UP ? HERE'S A SECRET, BOYCHICK. THE ELECTRICITY MAKES EVERYTHING BRIGHTER. I COULD SEE. ALL THE JEWS WERE AFRAID, BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IF YOU KILLED ME, ALL THE JEWS WOULD DIE. ( Cohn ) WE DON'T WANT TO BE DISTRUBED, OKAY ? ( man ) YES, SIR. I'M GLAD YOU ASKED TO SEE ME. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME ? I DIDN'T ASK TO SEE YOU. I WAS SUBPOENAED. WE'LL STOP RIGHT NOW WITH THE LAWYER TERMS AND THE WEASEL WORDS. ALL RIGHT ? YOU'RE UNITED NATIONS' CHIEF COUNSEL. IF ANYBODY KNOWS WHO THE REDS AND PINKOS ARE, IT'D BE YOU, OR IT SHOULD BE. I'VE ALREADY BEEN ASKED THIS-- WHY ARE YOU HAVING A HARD TIME ANSWERING THIS ? I UNDERSTAND. IT'S PERSONAL, RIGHT ? TALKING ABOUT YOUR FRIENDS. NOBODY LIKES TO TALK ABOUT THEIR FRIENDS. NATIONAL SECURITY CAN'T BE ENDANGERED BECAUSE OF FEELINGS FOR YOUR FRIENDS. UNDERSTAND ME ? ASK ME ANYTHING ABOUT MYSELF. YOU SEE THAT ? SEE THAT FLAG ? THERE'S A WAR GOING ON RIGHT NOW BETWEEN AMERICANISM AND COMMUNISM. IF YOU'RE A FRIEND OF AMERICA'S ENEMIES, THEN YOU'RE AN ENEMY, TOO. DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME ? I KNOW YOUR FATHER, ROY, YOU KNOW THAT ? YOU'RE LIKE MESHPUCHA TO ME. NOTHING TO HIDE ? I SAW YOU WHEN YOU WERE A KID. YOU CERTAINLY GOT NOTHING TO HIDE FROM ME. WHY DID YOU CHOOSE TO HIDE BEHIND YOUR CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVILEGE ? IT'S NOT A PRIVILEGE, ROY. IT'S A RIGHT. YOU MUST HAVE A SECRET, OR YOU WOULDN'T INVOKE YOUR PRIVILEGE. IT'S NOT A PRIVILEGE. IT'S A RIGHT. OKAY. GIVE ME THAT. NOT UNDER OATH, OKAY ? YOU'VE NEVER BEEN SUBPOENAED. YOU CAN STOP HOCKING ME. HERE WE ARE: A COUPLE OF JEWS SITTING IN A ROOM TALKING. OKAY ? HEY. WANT SOME COFFEE ? LET'S HAVE SOME COFFEE. THE FBI KNOWS THESE PEOPLE. HOW DO YOU THINK WE GOT YOUR NAME ? IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE BETRAYING ANYBODY. ROY, I.... ROY, I DIDN'T BECOME CHIEF COUNSEL AT THE UN TO BECOME CHIEF EXECUTIONER OF MY FELLOW MAN. THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF MY WORK AT THE UNITED NATIONS IS TO HELP CREATE A WORLD FREE OF STATES THAT HAVE INHUMAN INTERROGATIONS LIKE THIS. YOU TAKE CREAM ? I DON'T WANT YOUR COFFEE. OH, GOD. GOD. GOD. GOD. GOD. GOD. WHAT WILL YOU DO TO THEM ? WELL... NOTHING. WHAT WILL YOU DO TO THEM ? NOTHING. YOU COULD, THOUGH. YOU COULD FIRE THEM. THAT WOULD SHOW YOUR LOYALTY. OR YOU CAN JUST GIVE ME THE NAMES. ( reporter ) SEN. McCARTHY, ( McCarthy ) HAND WRINGING ABOUT THESE TRAITORS INFILTRATING OUR GOVERNMENT. THEY WANT THE COMMUNISTS-- THEY WANT THE BRUTALITARIAN COMMUNIST NETWORKS EXPOSED. THEY'RE SWINE. I'M NOT AFRAID TO POINT THEM OUT AND GET THEM OUT. I'LL GET THEM OUT OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT, OUT OF THE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. DON'T GET ME STARTED. WHEN WILL YOU ACTUALLY RELEASE THOSE NAMES ? THIS ISN'T A PRESS CONFERENCE. IT'S FOR CHRISTMAS. YOU'LL GET THE NAMES. SORRY. EXCUSE ME. ROY COHN. WITH THE... UNITED NATIONS, YES. CAN WE HAVE A PRIVATE MOMENT ? A LOT OF HANDS TO SHAKE, BUT LATER. JUST A MINUTE. DON'T WORRY. LATER. HI, I'M ROBERT KENNEDY. I KNOW WHO YOU ARE. WELL, YOU... YOU KNOW ME ? YOU BETTER CATCH HIM EARLY. OH, OH. I'LL CATCH HIM RIGHT NOW. THANKS, I OWE YOU ONE. HOW ARE YOU ? YOU'RE A LITTLE WET BEHIND THE EARS. I GOT THE ROSENBERG CONVICTIONS AND THE DEATH PENALTIES. SAYPOL GOT THOSE. YOU WERE A PAPER PUSHER, KID. BUT CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE: YOU DID WELL ON THAT THING FOR PAT McCARRAN. THANK YOU, SIR. I'M MOVING FROM RANKING MINORITY TO CHAIRMAN. IT'LL BE MY SUBCOMMITTEE. WANT TO COME ON OVER ? YOU'VE GOT BOBBY KENNEDY. AS CHIEF COUNSEL PROBABLY, BUT NOT APPOINTED YET. I CAN'T SIT BEHIND HIM AND WATCH HIM DESTROY YOUR WORK. DESTROY MY WORK, HOW DO YOU MEAN ? I'VE SEEN ENOUGH NAMES WORKING FOR PAT McCARRAN. YOU'LL BE HAULING UP JEW AFTER JEW, ALL THOSE EUROPEAN NAMES. WITH McCARTHY AND KENNEDY TOGETHER, IT'LL LOOK LIKE AN IRISH-CATHOLIC RUN POGROM. THAT WILL DISCREDIT EVERYTHING YOU DO. I KNOW. BECAUSE I'M A JEW. BUT THEY'RE COMMUNISTS. THEY BETRAYED THE FAITH OF THE FATHERS FOR THIS SOCIALIST GOD OF IRON. THAT'S THE ISSUE, NOT ANTI-SEMITISM. THAT'S NOT WHAT YOUR OPPOSITION WILL SAY. IT'S VERY HARD SOMETIMES TO CONTROL WHAT AN ISSUE REALLY IS. IF YOUR ENEMIES CAN FIND A WAY TO TWIST YOUR MOTIVES, BELIEVE ME, THEY'LL DO IT. YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE PUSHING YOU, BUT IF IT WERE ME CHOOSING, SIR, THAT KENNEDY WOULD BE MORE AT HOME WITH THE DEMOCRATS. MAYBE HE COULD BE MINORITY COUNSEL, IN MY ESTIMATION. YOU MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND. YOUR FATHER IS A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT. SENATOR, IF I THOUGHT THAT MY FATHER WERE DISLOYAL TO THIS COUNTRY, I'D PUT HIS NAME ON THE LIST. I'D PUT HIM IN A WITNESS CHAIR AND TEAR HIM TO PIECES. YOU THINK BOBBY KENNEDY WILL DO THAT WITH JOE SR. ? WHY AREN'T YOU DRINKING ? WHY ? DO I HAVE SOMETHING TO CELEBRATE ? YOU'VE GOT A MOUTH. TO THE BIRTH OF JESUS. RIGHT. ANOTHER TOUGH JEW. I THINK I LIKE IT. GOOD EVENING, AMERICA. LET'S GO TO PRESS. FLASH! WASHINGTON, D.C. WEDDING BELLS BECOME WARNING BELLS. THE NEW ALLIANCE BETWEEN SUPER RED HUNTER JOSEPH McCARTHY AND WONDER-BOY COMMIE-CATCHING U.S. ATTORNEY ROY COHN WILL WHEEDLE OUT ALL THOSE AMERICAN-SKIS SECRETLY ON MISSIONS FROM MOSCOW. MUSIC TO MINE EARS. ( Dora ) ROY ! HA ! A MAID COMES IN TWICE A DAY. YEAH. ROOM SERVICE, I PICK UP THE PHONE. WORKING WITH McCARTHY, I OWN THE TOWN. OWN THE TOWN. THAT'S WONDERFUL STUFF. THESE ARE ALL IN PREPARATION. LOOK AT THIS. THIS ONE? FBI INVESTIGATION, ARMY, G2 SUMMARIES. VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS, ALL VERY SENSITIVE INVESTIGATIONS. I WORKED VERY HARD. HALF A PAGE ! OH ! YOU LISTEN TO WINCHELL ? OF COURSE I DO ! DOES HE LOVE ME ? ABE FELLER IS A COMMUNIST LIKE YOU'RE A COMMUNIST. I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW, SIR. A FRIEND OF MINE CALLED ME TODAY. ABE FELLER'S STAFF HAS BEEN FIRED BECAUSE HE GAVE THEM THE NAMES. THEN THEY FIRED ABE FELLER. WHO'S YOUR FRIEND, DAD ? ABE FELLER IS A JEW. ABE FELLER IS A LIBERAL. ABE FELLER IS A VISIONARY. FOR THOSE THINGS, HE DOES NOT DESERVE THIS. I JUST GOT THE HOTTEST JOB IN WASHINGTON. DO YOU THINK YOU COULD BE PROUD OF ME ? WHY YOU HAVE DONE WHAT YOU'VE DONE IS A PROFOUND MYSTERY TO ME. WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO GET A NOD FROM YOU ? YOU THINK COMMUNISM'S A JOKE ? HITLER WASN'T A JOKE. WELL, TO ME, A COMMIE JEW IS AS DISGUSTING TO YOU AS A NAZI JEW WOULD BE. YOU SHOULD BE SAYING, "GOOD WORK, SON. I AM SO PROUD OF YOU." HAVE THOSE WORDS EVER COME OUT OF YOUR MOUTH ? IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING NICE TO SAY, SAY IT OR GO. THE BOY IS HOME FOR THE WEEKEND, SO JUST LET IT BE. I AM TRYING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHAT IS RIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT'S RIGHT ? WHAT'S RIGHT CHANGES EVERY 10 MINUTES. WHAT IS RIGHT NEVER CHANGES. I AM ASHAMED. WHO'S YOUR FRIEND ? NO, FORGET IT. ( Dora ) ROY ! WHO'S YOUR FRIEND ? ROY ! ROY ! WHO'S YOUR FRIEND ? ROY ! DAD. HE DOES NOT GRASP THINGS THE WAY WE DO. HE HAS NO GRASP OF THINGS. HE, HE, HE, JUST... THEY'RE CLUBHOUSE BOYS. THEY STICK TOGETHER. I AM PROUD OF YOU-- ALWAYS. SO, UM... YOU LIKE THIS GIRL ? YOU MET HER BEFORE. SHE'S A FRIEND. WITH A HAIRDO LIKE THIS ? YEAH, I LIKE HER. YEAH. SHE'S NOT FOR US, IS SHE ? WE CAN DO BETTER. WE CAN DO BETTER. IT IS NOT THE LESS FORTUNATE OR MEMBERS OF THE MINORITY GROUPS WHO HAVE BEEN SELLING THIS NATION OUT, BUT RATHER THOSE WHO HAVE HAD ALL THE BENEFITS THE WEALTHIEST NATION ON EARTH HAS TO PROVIDE. I HAVE THEIR NAMES. THESE NAMES WILL BE CALLED TO ACCOUNT: THE BRIGHTEST AND THE MOST PRIVILEGED , WHO SWORE TO PROTECT THE CONSTITUTION AND DEFEND THE SAME AMERICA THEY NOW PLOT TO BRING LOW. I WANT IT TO LIGHT THE SPARK OF A MORAL UPRISING THAT WILL END ONLY WHEN THE WHOLE MESS OF TWISTED , WARPED THINKERS ARE SWEPT FROM THE NATIONAL SCENE AND WE HAVE A REBIRTH OF NATIONAL HONESTY AND DECENCY. ( applauding and cheering ) THE LAST TIME WE MET WITH ABE FELLER, HE CONFIDED RATHER OPENLY ABOUT THE PRESSURES FROM SPECIAL INTERESTS WITHIN HIS OWN ORGANIZATION. APPARENTLY, SADLY, TRAGICALLY, THEY OVERWHELMED HIM. TO GIVE ABE FELLER'S DEATH MEANING, WE OWE IT TO HIM AND TO OURSELVES TO CONTINUE TO ROOT OUT THIS CONSPIRACY, TO BRING IT TO LIGHT, AND TO BRING IT TO AN END. THAT WAY, THERE WILL NEVER HAVE TO BE ANY MORE ABE FELLERS. ( McCarthy ) MR. PRESIDENT, I...I...I... I DON'T CARE WHAT THE BUREAUCRATS THINK OF YOUR WORK. IT'S SICKENING TO ME. AMERICANS ARE FED UP. I WAS TOLD I COULD READ MY STATEMENT. I'VE NO DOUBT YOU WERE, MR. KAPLAN. WE CAN DO IT. WE'LL JUST INSERT A STATEMENT INTO THE RECORD. WINCHELL'S MY MAN, SO JUST LET ME DO IT. SENATOR, I INSIST ON THE PROMISE THAT I BE ALLOWED TO READ MY STATEMENT. I WANT THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE MY STATEMENT IMPUGNING UN-AMERICAN MOTIVES... CHECK MY MAIL. NOW, PLEASE. AT THE CONSENT OF THE COMMITTEE, YOUR STATEMENT WILL BE MADE PART OF THE RECORD. CHIEF COUNSEL WILL BEGIN THE QUESTIONING. IF YOU'LL GIVE YOUR STATEMENT TO THE CLERK. ( Cohn ) STATE YOUR NAME AND THE NATURE OF YOUR WORK. STATE YOUR NAME-- RAYMOND KAPLAN. I'M AN ENGINEER WITH THE VOICE OF AMERICA. I'VE BEEN IN THEIR EMPLOY SINCE, SINCE... SINCE, IT'S BEEN AROUND, ABOUT 10 YEARS. I THOUGHT THAT TO BE A GOOD ENGINEER, YOU'D HAVE TO BE INTELLIGENT. WOULD YOU AGREE ? THERE ARE ALL KINDS, LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE. LET ME REPHRASE IT: A "C" STUDENT ISN'T GOING TO MAKE IT, A "B" STUDENT MIGHT SQUEAK BY. YOU MUST BE SMART. IT HELPS. AN EYE FOR DETAIL, AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE RECEIVING, THE TRANSMITTING OF RADIO WAVES, ETC. YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT DOWN PAT. YES, SIR. AND YOU DO, OTHERWISE YOU MIGHT MAKE A MISTAKE. YES, SIR. SINCE WE HAVE ELIMINATED INCOMPETENCE, WOULDN'T IT BE FAIR TO SAY WHEN YOU ORDERED TRANSMISSION TOWERS ERECTED WHERE THEY COULDN'T SIGNAL COUNTRIES WE'D LIKE TO REACH, IT MUST'VE BEEN DONE ON PURPOSE. I'M SORRY. WHY-- I'M SORRY. EXCUSE ME. DID I SAY SOMETHING FUNNY ? DID I... DID I SAY SOMETHING... I DON'T THINK IT'S FUNNY. ...TO EMBARRASS MYSELF ? WHY WOULD WE ? WHY? BECAUSE THERE ARE DISLOYAL PEOPLE WORKING FOR THE VOICE OF AMERICA. WE KNOW AND YOU KNOW. I DON'T KNOW THAT. THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU JUST SAID. YOU ADMITTED THE TOWERS WERE INTENTIONALLY PLACED-- IT'S MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT. FOR EXAMPLE, SUNSPOTS: THEY AFFECT THE TRANSMISSION. IT'S NOT EXACTLY CLEAR HOW... SUNSPOTS ? ( laughing ) DID HE SAY SUNSPOTS ? PERHAPS DISLOYAL AMERICANS SELLING OUT OUR COUNTRY. YOU KNOW WHO WE MEAN. NO. NO, SIR, I SIMPLY DISAGREE. MR. KAPLAN, SIR. IF YOU WANT TO HELP THE VOICE OF AMERICA , GET BACK TO WORK, AND WE ALL WANT TO HELP THE VOICE OF AMERICA , THEN WHY DON'T YOU TELL US WHO MADE THESE STUPID MISTAKES, AS YOU SAID. I DIDN'T. BUT AS YOU SAY NOW, THEY DID MAKE MISTAKES. THEY PLACED, VOA TOWERS WHERE THE AMERICAN MESSAGE COULDN'T GET OUT-- WHERE IT WAS INAUDIBLE IN THE COUNTRIES THAT WE WANTED IT TO REACH. YOU KNOW WHO WE MEAN. NAMES, RAY ? IF THEY'RE DISLOYAL, WE'LL FIND OUT. IF YOU ARE DISLOYAL, WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHY YOU DON'T WANT TO TELL US. MR. KAPLAN, YOU'RE TRYING THE PATIENCE OF THIS COMMITTEE AND WASTING VALUABLE TIME. YOU'RE UNDER SUBPOENA. ( Cohn ) YOU COULD BE HELD IN CONTEMPT. ( McCarthy ) AND JAILED. ( Cohn ) COULD WE HAVE THOSE NAMES, PLEASE ? ( McCarthy ) NAMES TELL THE TRUTH. ( Cohn ) MR. KAPLAN, GIVE US THE NAMES, PLEASE ! ( Kennedy ) YOU PUT ME IN AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION. I'M NOT THE POSTMAN. ( Cohn ) I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO BE. I ASKED YOU A SIMPLE FAVOR. I'M IN THE STUDIO EVERY DAY. CAN WE TALK TOMORROW ? CALL ME THERE. DICTATE TO MY SECRETARY, I'LL PUT IT ON THE AIR.

HOW WOULD THE SUPER JEW BOY LIKE TO MEET THE ACE CATHOLIC MICK IN NEW YORK ? ( Winchell ) THERE WAS THIS TEXAN AND THIS JEW ON THE MOON ( Cohn ) I'LL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW, THIS IS A GOYISH JOKE. A JEWISH JOKE THEY WOULDN'T BE ON THE MOON. WHERE WOULD THEY BE ? MIAMI. ( Winchell ) MIAMI BEACH, THEY WOULDN'T GO TO MIAMI. ( Cohn ) THAT'S A JEWISH JOKE. A JEWISH TRAGEDY IS TAMPA. GOOD TO SEE YOU, CARDINAL. WALTER. CARDINAL. JOE. THIS IS HIS CHIEF LEGAL COUNSEL. ROY COHN, FRANCIS CARDINAL SPELLMAN. YOUR EMINENCE. MR. COHN. GENTLEMEN, A GOOD GROUP. ROY. ALWAYS ENJOY MEETING A FELLOW PRIEST. IN HEBREW, "COHN" MEANS "PRIEST." THEN CARDINAL SPELLMAN, YOU WILL HAVE TO BE MY RABBI. FAIR IS FAIR. EVIL EXISTS. IT'S AROUND US ALL THE TIME. IT'S SO PERVASIVE THAT WE DON'T SEE IT, LIKE THE PATTERN IN THE WALLPAPER. PEOPLE LIVE IN AN EVIL WORLD LIKE FISH IN THE SEA. THEY SWIM IN IT. WALLOW IN IT. FUCK IN IT. THEY DON'T THINK OR TALK ABOUT EVIL, BECAUSE THEY DON'T SEE EVIL. WE NEED PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND MR. COHN TO MAKE THEM SEE. TO FORCE THEM TO STOP AND LOOK. TO DISCOVER COMMUNISM FOR WHAT IT IS: THE MARCH OF THE SOLDIER SLAVES OF CAIN INCARNATE AGAIN. IT'S NOT EVEN SUNDAY. WHAT AMAZES ME IS THE NUMBER OF HATE LETTERS I GET WHEN I TRY TO UNMASK THE REDS IN OUR GOVERNMENT. HATE LETTERS FROM ALL THE BLEEDING HEARTS. EXCELLENT CHOICE. THANK YOU. DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE COMMITTEE CAN EXPECT THE SUPPORT OF THE CHURCH, CARDINAL ? I'M NOT A CATHOLIC, OF COURSE, BUT WE BELIEVE IN THE SAME GOD. WE BELIEVE IN THE SAME VALUES. I DON'T SPEAK FOR THE CHURCH. THE POPE SPEAKS FOR THE CHURCH. BUT ANY ENEMY OF SATAN IS AN ALLY OF THE ARCHDIOCESE OF NEW YORK. ( Cohn ) WELL SAID. WAITER. WAITER ? MORE WINE FOR THE SENATOR.

DAVID'S HERE FOR THE NORTHEAST SECTION OF HIS FAMILY'S HOTEL CHAIN. HE ALSO WROTE A BOOK ON COMMUNISM. FOR OR AGAINST ?

ANYBODY ELSE? WE'RE FINE, JUST FINE. EXCUSE ME. THANKS. YOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID ? CAN YOU EXCUSE US FOR A SECOND ? GO POWDER YOUR NOSE. YOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID? HE SAID HE HAD NO SENSE OF HUMOR. NOBODY SAYS THAT. NOBODY EVER ADMITS TO THAT OR BEING A LOUSY LOVER. I'VE NEVER HEARD IT. BUT LOOK... HE'S AS DEVOTED AS A PUPPY DOG, AND RICH AS A ROCKEFELLER. I OWE HIS OLD MAN SOME FAVORS. MAYBE YOU CAN FIND A SPOT FOR HIM ON THE COMMITTEE OR SOMETHING. I SAY, I'D BE FLATTERED, BUT YOU GO INTO WORK EVERY DAY. IS IT EARLY ? I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE NOT. HE'S KIDDING, RIGHT ? YOU ARE SO FUNNY. YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT WORKING ON THE COMMITTEE. JOE, I THINK THIS COULD BE A POSSIBLE ASSET. THINK OF IT AS A CHARACTER BUILDER OR JUST, YOU KNOW, A HOOT. TO BE PART OF SOMETHING GREAT-- YOU KNOW THAT-- BOY, THAT WOULD BE-- WELL, GREAT. I'M BACK. WHERE DID YOU GO ? AAH. BETTER TIMES. FULL OF HOPE. OH, GOD. WE WERE SO YOUNG. WHAT'S THE INDICTMENT, DOCTOR ? THEORETICAL ? PRINCIPLE ? PERSONAL ? GIVE IT A NAME. I DON'T NAME NAMES. WE KNOW THEM ALREADY, SO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE ? WHAT DID I EVER DO TO YOU ? I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU. I HAD AN UNCLE, A NUCLEAR PHYSICIST, KIND OF A DREAMER. HE LOST HIS JOB AND HE NEVER WORKED AGAIN. THE SHIT HIT THE FAN AND A LITTLE GOT ON YOU. AMAZING. WHAT A SMALL WORLD. A LOT OF DREAMS DIED. NOW YOU'VE GOT ROY COHN RIGHT WHERE YOU WANT HIM. NO WONDER YOU'RE TRYING TO KILL ME. THAT KIND OF MALICE IS JUST BEYOND MY STRENGTH. CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT ? YOU WON'T TRY TO HURT ME. YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY ? BECAUSE YOU'RE STILL AFRAID OF ME. TAXPAYERS ARE SPENDING $100 MILLION A YEAR TO MAINTAIN OUR LIBRARIES ACROSS THE SEAS, TO GET OUT THE AMERICAN MESSAGE. IS IT RIGHT THAT THOSE LIBRARIES SHOULD BE STOCKED WITH BOOKS BY COMMUNISTS ? WE HAVE A LIST OF THOSE BOOKS AND THOSE AUTHORS. THAT IS WHAT G. DAVID SCHINE AND ROY COHN ARE CRUSADING AGAINST. ANY PROBLEMS WITH THAT? ( man ) WHAT'S YOUR JURISDICTION ? OUR JURISDICTION? WHAT'S YOUR NAME? THE WHOLE DAMN GOVERNMENT, THAT'S OUR JURISDICTION AND DON'T FORGET IT ! ( air controller ) THIS IS ORLY TOWER. ROGER 93. LESS THAN 55 MINUTES TO ORLY STATION. ( Cohn ) MR. SCHINE AND I ARE HOT ON THE TRAIL. WE ARE FINDING THIS INSIDIOUS MIND-WASHING GOING ON EVERYWHERE. WE FOUND ENOUGH TO QUESTION SERIOUSLY THE LOYALTY OF OUR OWN ADMINISTRATORS. PLENTY ON THE SHELVES BY SUBVERSIVES, DASHIELL HAMMETT BUT NOT A SINGLE COPY OF THE AMERICAN LEGION MAGAZIN. NO MORE QUESTIONS. THAT'S IT. GET IN THE CAR. DO THEY HAVE CHAMPAGNE? THESE FROGS NEVER STOP. SHUT UP ! GET AWAY. MR. SCHINE IS AN EXPERT ON THE COMMUNIST CONSPIRACY. HIS BOOK IS READ ALL ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. SHOULD I TELL HIM TO PUT THIS NEXT TO THE BIBLE? WE'LL KNOCK THEM DEAD IN SPAIN. ( speaking German ) VERSTEHEN, LIEBLING ? ( reporter ) ARE WE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THE MALTESE FALCON AND THE THIN MAN ARE ACTUALLY MARXIST PROPAGANDA ? MR. COHN, IS WILLIAM KARL MARX OR TROTSKY, WOULD YOU SAY? IS ASTA LENIN OR ENGELS? MR. COHN, DO YOU INTEND TO BURN THE BOOKS? MR. SCHINE, HAVE YOU READ THE BOOKS? WHAT ABOUT MR. HAMMETT, SIR? ( Cohn ) MR. HAMMETT? THANK YOU. YOUR BOOKS USED TO BE IN ALL THE OVERSEAS LIBRARIES. BUT NO MORE. ♪NO MORE, NO MORE, NO MORE, NO MORE♪ BEING ON YOUR LIST IS AN HONOR AND I AM FOREVER IN YOUR DEBT. LOOK, HAMMETT-- THE ONLY PERSON WHO CALLS ME HAMMETT IS HELLMAN. MR. HELLMAN-- MR. HAMMETT. YOU'RE NOT HURTING THIS COMMITTEE WITH YOUR REMARKS. YOU'RE ONLY HURTING YOURSELF. WE ARE GIVING YOU THIS SHOT AT SAVING YOUR CAREER. DESCRIBE THE APPARATUS OF YOUR ORGANIZATION: TO WHOM YOU REPORTED, WHAT THEY TOLD YOU TO WRITE, OTHERS YOU MAY HAVE SEEN AT MEETINGS. YOU'LL HAVE TO TESTIFY TO A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF THIS IN PUBLIC SESSION. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT, BUT IT ISN'T SO, NOHOW. CONTRARIWISE, IF IT WAS SO, IT MIGHT BE. IF IT WERE SO, IT WOULD BE, BUT AS IT ISN'T, IT AIN'T. THAT'S LOGIC. VERY FUNNY. THAT'S ALICE IN WONDERLAND. YEAH. TWEEDLEDUM AND TWEEDLEDEE. SO LONG, KIDS. MR. HAMMETT. MR. HAMMETT. I MEAN, IT'S A FREE COUNTRY, ISN'T IT ? SO FAR ? ( McCarthy ) MR. HAMMET ? ( Cohn ) MR. HAMMET ? LET'S HAUL HIM UP BEFORE THE COMMITTEE AND MAKE HIM SWEAR THE OATH. HE PULLS THAT SHIT ON US THERE, WE STICK HIS ASS IN JAIL. LET'S DO IT. THEY DRAFTED DAVID. THE MEDIA FOUND OUT HE WAS REGISTERED IN CALIFORNIA. THEY TRANSFERRED HIM TO NEW YORK. THE BOARD GOT SCARED, HE'S IN THE ARMY. I ALWAYS LIKED THE THIN MAN. HAMMETT'S A GOOD WRITER. COME ON, JOE. WE JUST NAILED UP A REAL RED. HE LIVES WITH LILLIAN HELLMAN. SHE'S PROBABLY A DYKE. SHE WRITES PLAYS ABOUT THEM. DOES THAT MEAN AYN RAND IS A DYKE, TOO? PROBABLY. NO. HOOVER'S BEEN WATCHING HELLMAN, AND SHE DOES IT WITH GUYS. JOE, JUST BECAUSE LILLIAN HELLMAN LIVES WITH A MAN DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN SHE'S NOT A HOMOSEXUAL. EVERYBODY STARTS OUT STRAIGHT. I'VE NEVER HEARD OF ANYBODY BEING BORN HOMOSEXUAL. TIME GOES BY AND... SOMETIMES, I GUESS... IT HAPPENS TO THEM WITHOUT THEM EVEN KNOWING IT. HOW MUCH DO YOU REALLY KNOW ABOUT SCHINE? WHAT ABOUT DAVID? JOE...JOE. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SAY ANYTHING TO GET YOU. IT WAS HIS WORK FOR US THAT MADE THE PRESS INVESTIGATE HIS DRAFT STATUS. THEY'LL DO ANYTHING TO UNDERMINE YOU AND YOUR CONFIDENCE IN US. YOU'VE LOST CONFIDENCE IN ME? I'LL RESIGN, SIR. DON'T GIVE ME THAT "SIR" SHIT. JOE, I KNOW YOU LIKE HAMMETT'S BOOKS. HE'S A GOOD WRITER, PROBABLY A GOOD GUY. MICHELANGELO WAS A GREAT ARTIST: A PAINTER, INVENTOR, SCULPTOR. AND YET, HE WAS A PERVERT. AND HE WAS DISLOYAL TO HIS PRINCE. GO AFTER THAT SUPERCILIOUS HAMMETT SON OF A BITCH. I WANT TO HELP DAVID, TOO. OH, YES. GOD FORBID, G. DAVID SCHINE SHOULD EVER HAVE TO SLEEP ON THE GROUND. GOD FORBID. ( telephone buzzing ) YES ? PUT HIM ON. MR. COHN ? THIS IS BOB STEVENS. HOW CAN I HELP YOU ? THIS IS ROY COHN, CHIEF COUNSEL TO THE McCARTHY COMMITTEE. I know that. OUR ASSISTANT COUNSEL, G. DAVID SCHINE, WILL BE ENTERING THE ARMY SHORTLY. THE SENATOR'S REQUESTING A COMMISSION FOR MR. SCHINE THAT HE BE ATTACHED TO OUR SENATE COMMITTEE AS HIS MILITARY ASSIGNMENT. THAT'S NORMALLY HANDLED THROUGH THE OFFICE OF LEGISLATIVE LIAISON. You're the secretary of the Army of the United States of America. You can do this. TELL THE SENATOR TO PUT IT THROUGH REGULAR CHANNELS. IF THERE'S A PROBLEM, THEY CAN DEAL WITH IT. WHY DON'T WE JUST MEET AND YOU GET TO KNOW HIM? COHN, THEY'RE READY FOR US. Put it through the legislative liaison officer, that's major- BOB, JUST DO IT. ANNIE LEE MOSS. ( Cohn ) ANNIE LEE MOSS. YES, SIR. I JUST SAID IT. YOU KNOW YOU'VE TAKEN AN OATH TO BE TRUTHFUL IN YOUR ANSWERS. YES ? YES, SIR. DO YOU WORK FOR THE U.S. ARMY SIGNAL CORPS WITH ACCESS TO THE CONFIDENTIAL AND SECURITY FILES? NO, SIR. NO, SIR. I DON'T. YOU DON'T WORK IN THE PENTAGON? YOU'RE SWORN TO TELL THE TRUTH. I DON'T WORK ANYWHERE. I'M ON SUSPENSION. ( laughing ) ( McCarthy ) THIS ISN'T FOR LAUGHS. AND DON'T THINK A PLEA OF SYMPATHY IS GOING TO DISTRACT US. PLEASE, ANSWER THIS: ARE YOU NOW OR HAVE YOU EVER BEEN A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY ? NO, SIR, I'M A DEMOCRAT. ( laughing ) WE HAVE TESTIMONY BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE THAT YOUR NAME APPEARS ON A LIST OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY. MY JOB WAS IN THE CAFETERIA, CLEANING UP. I WANT THOSE FILES FOR THOSE TWO MEN. DAVID, YOU SCREWED THIS UP. GO HELP HIM. EVERYTHING IS IN CODE AND I DON'T KNOW ANY CODE. WHAT? YOU DON'T KNOW CODE? NO, SIR. CAN I GET MY JOB BACK? ( laughing ) CHIEF COUNSEL WILL CONTINUE THE QUESTIONING. THIS AMUSES YOU, DOESN'T IT? YOU WON'T GET YOUR JOB BACK AND YOU'LL BE IN PRISON FOR PERJURY. MR. CHAIRMAN, IF I MAY-- THIS CAN WAIT-- I UNDERSTAND THAT MRS. ANNIE LEE MOSS HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BY NAME BUT NOT BY SIGHT, CORRECT ? WE'VE WITNESSES-- CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF COUNSEL SHOULD HAVE THIS INFORMATION. THERE SEEM TO BE 3 ANNIE LEE MOSSES IN THE DISTRICT PHONE DIRECTORY. THIS WOMAN, WHO MAY HAVE BEEN DONE AN INJUSTICE HERE, COMES OFF STRAIGHTFORWARD TO ME. I SUGGEST THAT WE'D BE DOING OUR DUTY RESPONSIBLY TO EXCUSE THIS WITNESS AND LOOK TO OUR OWN PROCEDURES FOR INVESTIGATION. IF IT TAKES A VOTE, I'D LIKE TO VOTE. UH, MRS. MOSS... YOU ARE EXCUSED FOR NOW. ( Cohn ) WONDERING HOW WE'RE DOING ON THAT COMMISSION FOR OUR ASSISTANT COUNSEL. ( Stevens ) WE'VE RUN INTO A PROBLEM ON THAT. I HOPED THAT MR. SCHINE HAD HAD SOME ROTC THAT WOULD'VE-- ( Cohn ) I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAS. ( Stevens ) HE DIDN'T, IT APPEARS, SHORT OF GOING TO OFFICERS' CANDIDATE SCHOOL... DAVID SCHINE AND McCARTHY AGREE THAT OFFICERS' CANDIDATE SCHOOL IS JUST THE THING. EXCELLENT. PVT. SCHINE CAN APPLY AS SOON AS HE'S OUT OF BASIC TRAINING. HOW LONG IS ALL THIS GOING TO TAKE: APPLICATION, SCHOOL AND TRAINING ? A year. MAYBE I WASN'T CLEAR. I SAID SEN. McCARTHY, McCARTHY, McCARTHY, McCARTHY ! DON'T GIVE ME ANY OF THIS BUREAUCRATIC BULLSHIT ABOUT PROCEDURE, OKAY ? JUST REMEMBER THAT NAME, AND THIS ONE: ROY COHN. ROY COHN ! YOU DON'T WANT TO MAKE ROY COHN ANGRY. ( Cohn ) STATE YOUR NAME. ANNIE LEE MOSS. ( McCarthy ) ARE YOU SURE ? THE REAL ANNIE LEE MOSS. YES, SIR. YOU DO, IN FACT, WORK AT THE PENTAGON ? YES, SIR. ARE YOU A COMMUNIST ? HAVE YOU EVER ATTENDED, UH, PARTY MEETINGS OF A COMMUNIST PARTY CELL ? WHERE AND WHEN WOULD THAT BE, SIR ? DON'T BE EVASIVE WITH ME, MRS. MOSS, BECAUSE I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL DO. WE'VE SUBPOENAED YOUR GROUP, INCLUDING ITS COMMUNIST LEADERSHIP, AND WE'LL PARADE THEM FOR ALL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO SEE, INCLUDING TWO LEADERS OF YOUR CELL WHO'LL COME HERE AND SWEAR THAT YOU'RE LYING TO THIS COMMITTEE. THE COMMITTEE IS TAKING A BRIEF RECESS. COME ON. ( man ) ROY, ROY, ROY ! ( man ) WHAT DO YOU MEAN WE'RE TAKING A RECESS ? IS THIS NECESSARY ? WE GOT WORD THE WITNESSES WON'T BE APPEARING. THEY DIDN'T GET THEIR SUBPOENAS ? WHO SCREWED THAT UP ? KENNEDY ? CAN YOU EXCUSE US ? IF THEY DON'T SHOW UP, WE'LL LOOK LIKE ASSHOLES. THE FBI CALLED AND SAID THEY CAN'T FIND THEM. THE FBI CAN'T FIND THEM ? YES. WHO CALLED FROM THE FBI ? J. EDGAR HOOVER HIMSELF. HOOVER ? YES. I DON'T BELIEVE THIS ! WE SHOULD GO AFTER THE FBI NEXT. ROY. JOHN. EXCUSE MRS. MOSS FROM ANY FURTHER TESTIMONY. YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT. NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO LET UP, BUT TO ATTACK. WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO TO ME ? I'M TRYING TO MAKE A GREAT MAN OUT OF YOU. TAXI ! ( Hoover ) ROY COHN ? MR. HOOVER. THEY'RE FBI AGENTS, ROY. I'M SORRY ? THOSE COMMUNISTS YOU SUBPOENAED. THEY'RE UNDERCOVER OPERATIVES OF THE BUREAU. WE WANT TO KEEP THEM UNDERCOVER. I DON'T WANT PHOTOGRAPHS OF THEM. YOU CAN'T CALL THEM. WE GOT TO THEM THROUGH ANOTHER FBI AGENT. LET NOT THE LEFT HAND KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT HAND IS DOING. THE AGENT YOU MENTIONED HAS NO KNOWLEDGE THE OTHERS ARE OURS. I'M CONFIDING IN YOU. I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT THE OTHERS WERE THE LEADERS OF THE CELL. WE WERE ABLE TO SEE THAT THEY HAD THE MONEY TO PAY ALL THEIR PARTY DUES, HAD THE TIME TO ATTEND ALL THE PARTY MEETINGS. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT AMERICA OWES YOU A DEBT OF GRATITUDE FOR PROTECTING THE IDENTITY OF MY MEN. THERE'LL BE EMBARRASSING MOMENTS FOR YOU, IN YOUR HEARINGS, WITH THE PRESS. BUT I WILL ALWAYS BE INDEBTED TO YOU. REMEMBER THAT. AND REMEMBER, THIS NEVER HAPPENED. ( military music ) AAH, HE IS THE FIGURE OF A SOLDIER, ISN'T HE ? -THAT'S WHAT HE IS. -WOO HOO ! HE'LL SERVE HIS COUNTRY IN THE U.S. ARMY AND HE'S GOING OVERSEAS. OVERSEAS ? WAIT A MINUTE. WE HAD A DEAL. YOU AGREED. I AGREED TO NOTHING. YOU'VE DONE IT. YOU'VE MADE ROY COHN SORE. SEE ? WE'RE NOT DONE YET. WE'RE NOT DONE YET. AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, SEND THE KID HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD. I'LL BE HAPPY. HEY, HEY ! LOOK AT YOU. HOW ARE YOU ? ALL RIGHT. FIX YOUR TIE. THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT MEETING. COME WITH ME. HMM ? AND THAT CUTE LITTLE HAT. STOP IT. SECRETARY OF THE ARMY, BOB STEVENS, IT'S TIME YOU MET PVT. G. DAVID SCHINE. HOW DO YOU DO ? YOU WITH THE CAMERA, HERE. GET A NICE SHOT OF THE 2 OF THEM TOGETHER. BOB, RIGHT HERE. DAVE, SMILE. ( Cohn ) You're holding Dave Schine hostage to keep us from investigating the Army and it won't work because I'll wreck you. The Senator has got names of a homosexual ring of generals. We're going public. You've got a nest of Communists in Fort Monmouth ? Why haven't you gone after them ? TAPE AFTER TAPE. IT'S RIGHT THERE. 34 PAGES OF CALLS AND MEETINGS PRESSURING THE ARMY. YOU WERE TRYING TO SET UP A SOFT TOUCH FOR DAVID SCHINE AND IT STINKS LIKE HELL. ( McCarthy ) SCHINE WAS A VALUABLE MAN. NOW, ASK YOURSELF WHY THE ARMY DOESN'T WANT HIM HELPING US. WHAT ARE THEY HIDING ? WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO HIDE ? YOU SON OF A BITCH. CAN WE BE MODERATELY CIVIL THIS AFTERNOON ? LIFE IS SHORT, GENTLEMEN. WE'RE ALL RESPONSIBLE TO THE COMMITTEE AND TO THE LEADERSHIP. NO MALODOROUS INFERENCES ARE TO BE DRAWN. WHAT'S YOUR POINT ? YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE AMBUSHED ON THE WAY TO YOUR OWN AMBUSH. BUT IF THESE TAPES GO OUT THERE, THE PRESS, AND I DARE SAY THE PUBLIC, WILL SURELY MOBILIZE AGAINST ALL OF US. THE ARMY ? THESE ARE OUR BOYS FIGHTING IN KOREA. THEY'RE HEROES. WHERE DID THESE TAPES COME FROM ? WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE JUDGE WHO AUTHORIZED THESE WIRETAPS ? HAS ANYBODY BOTHERED TO CHECK INTO HIS BACKGROUND ? BOB STEVENS ALWAYS MONITORS HIS PHONE CALLS. COME ON, ROY, YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT. THIS IS A TREMULOUS TIME. I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD SPEAK PRIVATELY WITHOUT STAFF. BUT I FIRST WANT TO EXPRESS MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU, MR. COHN. YOU HAVE THE TALENT OF RELENTLESS PURSUIT AND INCISIVENESS AND A SENSE OF MISSION THAT BOTH INSPIRES AND CHALLENGES. ROY, I KNOW YOU HONOR THE TRUTH AND WHILE YOU DO, I'LL SUPPORT YOU. NOW I KNOW HOW A PANCAKE FEELS HAVING SYRUP POURED OVER IT. HA, HA. STAFF... WILL LEAVE. WITH THIS REMINDER TO EVERYONE HERE: LOYALTY. THE ISSUE IS LOYALTY. LAY IT OUT. THE ARMY FEELS IT HAS BEEN WRONGED. THEY FEEL THAT MR. COHN IS HARASSING THEM BECAUSE OF A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP TO SCHINE. THEY WANT A SOFT CONCLUSION TO THE INVESTIGATION AND THE PRESSURE OR THE CHRONOLOGY IS PUT OUT TO THE PUBLIC. WHAT'S SCHINE DONE ? I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING. GET RID OF COHN. HE GOES OUT. HOW CAN I ? AND WHY SHOULD I ? HE'S GOT A GRASP OF THE... HE'S DEVELOPED SO MANY CASES, IT... THERE'S NO ONE WHO COULD STEP IN. IT WOULD BE A SURRENDER. A SURRENDER ! I DON'T SURRENDER. AND HIM. HO, HO. HE'D HOLLER. HE'D SCREAM FROM THE ROOFTOPS, "ANTI-SEMITISM." MAYBE HE'S RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. WE'LL LANCE THIS BOIL ON THE BODY POLITIC WITH THE CAMERAS ON. LET IT ALL COME OUT. ( musical beeping ) GOOD EVENING, AMERICA AND ALL THE SHIPS AT SEA. LET'S GO TO PRESS. MAINE TO CALIFORNIA AND ALL THE STOPS IN BETWEEN, keep your TVs humming this week for the battle of the century. Mr. America, first, last and always, Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy and his Commie-cornering comet, Roy Cohn, will be taking on the secret skeletons in the U.S. Army in the person of Robert Stevens. The bet in this corner ? McCarthy and Cohn by a knockout. That's Army loses, America wins. ( gavel banging ) ( Mundt ) IT IS MY DUTY TO CALL THIS HEARING TO ORDER. IT IS A DUTY I DO NOT WELCOME AND UNDERTAKE WITH GREAT DISTASTE. WE ARE HERE TO HEAR EVIDENCE RELATED TO A CHARGE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY OF HARASSMENT BY SEN. JOSEPH McCARTHY AND HIS STAFF AND THAT THEY IMPROPERLY ATTEMPTED TO INFLUENCE THE ARMY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FOR THE BENEFIT OF ONE PVT. G. DAVID SCHINE, A FORMER STAFF MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE. CHIEF COUNSEL FOR THIS HEARING IS MR. RAY JENKINS AND REPRESENTING THE DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY IS MR. JOSEPH WELCH. ( Welch ) THANK YOU, SIR. ( Mundt ) THE FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS: THE CLERK WILL SWEAR IN ROY MARCUS COHN. ( clerk ) ROY MARCUS COHN, DO YOU SOLEMNLY SWEAR TO TELL THE TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH, SO HELP YOU GOD ? I DO. BE SEATED. AS YOU CAN SEE, THIS PHOTO ILLUSTRATES THE GOODWILL BETWEEN PVT. SCHINE AND SECRETARY OF THE ARMY STEVENS. THERE WAS NO ANTAGONISM. AS IN ANY RELATIONSHIP, THERE'D BE OCCASIONAL MISUNDERSTANDINGS AND TEMPERS WOULD FLARE. BUT HOWEVER ONE CHOOSES TO READ CERTAIN STATEMENTS OUT OF CONTEXT, IT WAS ALWAYS A CORDIAL, COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SECRETARY STEVENS AND OUR OFFICES. UH... NOW, MR. COHN... UH, YEAH, MR. WELCH. AS COUNSEL FOR THE ARMY, I FEEL WE NEED TO MAKE THESE ISSUES CRYSTAL CLEAR, SO PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG. SIR, YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT I SHALL. ROY COHN IS HERE SPEAKING FOR ROY COHN TO GIVE THE FACTS. DO WE NOT HAVE BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE A LIST OF YOUR ATTEMPTS TO GAIN SPECIAL TREATMENT AND PRIVILEGES FOR MR. SCHINE-- THE LENGTH OF WHICH IS JUST AMAZING TO BEHOLD ? ARE YOU ASKING HOW I PLEAD ? ( laughing ) I WOULDN'T PUT IT THAT WAY. THIS IS A HEARING, NOT A TRIAL. POINT OF ORDER, MR. CHAIRMAN. WHAT IS YOUR POINT OF ORDER ? MY POINT OF ORDER IS THIS: WE DON'T HAVE TO BE ADVISED ON POINTS OF LAW BY THE COUNSEL FOR THE ARMY. WHY, I THINK YOU DO. I THINK YOU DO. I PLEAD "NOT GUILTY" ANYWAY. JUST FOR YOUR RECORDS. ( laughing ) MR. COHN, PERHAPS YOU COULD EXPLAIN TO THE COMMITTEE, PLEASE, SIR, WHY YOU SUBMITTED A DOCTORED PHOTOGRAPH TO THE COMMITTEE. I DO NOT THINK THAT PICTURE IS... I DON'T THINK THIS PICTURE HAS BEEN CHANGED. COME NOW, SIR. WHAT EXACTLY IS YOUR DEFINITION OF CHANGE ? CAN I SEE THAT UP HERE, PLEASE ? NO, SIR, YOU CANNOT. MAYBE I'M A LITTLE NEARSIGHTED, I CAN'T SEE THE PICTURE. YES, I DO BELIEVE YOU HAVE BETRAYED A CERTAIN NEARSIGHTEDNESS. HAVE IT THE WAY YOU WANT. COME DOWN HERE. I THINK YOU'LL SEE, AS DO WE ALL, THAT IN THIS ORIGINAL PICTURE, THERE IS A NEW CHARACTER IN THE SCENE: A COL. BRADLEY, AN AIDE TO SECRETARY STEVENS. CORRECT ? IF YOU TAKE THESE 2 PICTURES, YOU WILL SEE THAT THIS PART WITH STEVENS AND DAV-- PVT. SCHINE IS THE SAME. ANYONE WITH COMMON SENSE CAN LOOK AT IT AND SEE WHAT'S IN IT. ARE YOU SAYING THESE PICTURES ARE IDENTICAL ? THE RELATIONSHIP: SECRETARY STEVENS IS SMILING AT MR. SCHINE-- AT PVT. SCHINE. IS HE ? IS HE INDEED ? I THINK NOT, SIR. I DO BELIEVE THERE IS JUST A TRACE OF A SMILE-- A GRIM SMILE DIRECTED AT COL. BRADLEY. DON'T YOU THINK ? YOU CAN CHARACTERIZE HIS SMILE ANY WAY YOU WISH. I SEE HIM SMILING AT PVT. SCHINE. IN THIS PICTURE, WHERE YOU'VE CUT OUT BRADLEY. BUT IN THE REAL PICTURE HE'S LOOKING TO HIS RIGHT, AT COL. BRADLEY. DO YOU SEE JUST A TOUCH OF A SMILE HERE ON BRADLEY IN RETURN, LOOKING BACK AT SECRETARY STEVENS? CORRECT ? I'D SAY THAT I'D KNOW COL. BRADLEY HAD A GOOD STEAK DINNER THAT NIGHT AND PERHAPS HE WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT. IF BRADLEY WAS THINKING OF A STEAK, SCHINE MUST'VE BEEN CONSIDERING A WHOLE HAUNCH OF BEEF, WOULDN'T HE ? ( laughing ) I CAN'T REALLY TELL. WELL... PERHAPS, MR.COHN, YOU COULD TELL ME THE SOURCE OF THAT DOCTORED PHOTOGRAPH. I CAN, BUT I'VE A LOT TO ATTEND TO. IT'S NOT IN MY POSSESSION BUT THE INFORMATION IS SOMEWHERE. IT MUST HAVE COME FROM SOMEWHERE. DID YOU THINK THIS CAME FROM A PIXIE ? ( laughing ) ( McCarthy ) MAY I HAVE THE LAST QUESTION RE-READ ? THE LAST STATEMENT. ( clerk ) "IT MUST HAVE COME FROM SOMEWHERE. DID YOU THINK THIS CAME FROM A PIXIE ?" WOULD THE COUNSEL, FOR MY BENEFIT, DEFINE, AND I THINK YOU MAY BE SOMETHING OF AN EXPERT ON THAT, WHAT A PIXIE IS ? WHY, CERTAINLY. I SHOULD SAY THAT A PIXIE IS A CLOSE RELATIVE TO A FAIRY. ( laughing ) MAY I PROCEED HERE ? HAVE I ENLIGHTENED YOU ? I DEMAND A POINT OF ORDER. WHAT'S YOUR POINT OF ORDER ? THE COMMITTEE HAS NO RIGHT TO CAST THESE ASPERSIONS-- THAT IS NOT A POINT OF ORDER. THE COMMITTEE DID NOT CAST ASPERSIONS. IF IT WAS ANYONE, IT WAS I. OR IS IT IN YOUR MIND ? NOW, MR. COHN, IF I TOLD YOU NOW THERE WAS A COMMUNIST SPY AT FORT MONMOUTH YOU'D WANT HIM OUT OF THERE BY SUNDOWN, WOULD YOU NOT ? MR. WELCH, IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT COMMUNIST INFILTRATION, THEN I THINK WE SHOULD TELL MR. WELCH HE HAS IN HIS FIRM A YOUNG MAN NAMED FISHER WHO HAS, FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS, BEEN A MEMBER OF AN ORGANIZATION NAMED, OH... YEARS AND YEARS AGO AS THE LEGAL BULWARK OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY. I'VE HESITATED BRINGING THIS UP, BUT I HAVE BEEN BORED BY HIS PHONY IMPLICATIONS ABOUT MR. COHN. UNTIL THIS MOMENT, I NEVER REALLY GAUGED YOUR RECKLESSNESS OR YOUR CRUELTY. FRED FISHER IS BEGINNING WHAT LOOKS TO BE A BRILLIANT CAREER WITH US. WHEN I ASKED HIM TO COME HERE AND ASSIST US, HE TOLD ME THAT IN COLLEGE HE BRIEFLY BELONGED TO THE LAWYERS GUILD-- THE ORGANIZATION TO WHICH YOU REFER. I TOLD HIM, "I JUST DON'T THINK "I AM GOING TO USE YOU ON THIS CASE "BECAUSE IT MIGHT GO TO THE NETWORKS "AND THAT WOULD HURT LIKE THE DICKENS." SO, SENATOR, I SENT HIM BACK TO BOSTON. LITTLE DID I DREAM, THAT YOU WOULD BE SO CRUEL AND SO RECKLESS AS TO DO INJURY TO THIS LAD. IT'S TRUE HE WORKS FOR US, IT'S TRUE THAT HE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK FOR US AND IT'S TRUE, I FEAR, THAT HE WILL ALWAYS BEAR A SCAR NEEDLESSLY INFLICTED BY YOU. LET US NOT ASSASSINATE THIS LAD ANY FURTHER. SENATOR, YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH. HAVE YOU NO SENSE OF DECENCY, SIR, AT LONG LAST ? HAVE YOU NO SENSE OF DECENCY ? THIS HEARING WILL COME TO ORDER. YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY. THEY'RE TRYING TO SMEAR THE STAFF OF THIS COMMITTEE. ( Mundt ) YOU WILL COME TO ORDER IN THIS HEARING ROOM ! ( gavel banging ) DO YOU HAVE ANY EVIDENCE OF ANY KIND ? YOU SHOULDN'T DO THIS. IT'S DISHONEST. IT'S THE SAME THING COMMUNISTS DO. ( Mundt ) YOU'LL TAKE YOUR SEATS. THIS HEARING WILL COME TO ORDER. MR. COHN. I DON'T NEED IT. YOU NEED IT. YOU'VE BEEN SHOUTING. GET USED TO IT. I'M GETTING STRONGER. I DON'T FUCKING NEED IT. AAH. WHY NOT TAKE IT ? WE'LL HAVE NO DEMONSTRATIONS OF APPROVAL OR DISAPPROVAL. WELL... HOW DID I DO, MR. COHN ? ( Cohn ) THE TRIAL IS OVER. YOU GOT McCARTHY, BUT YOU DIDN'T GET ME. YOU THINK YOU'RE ON TRIAL HERE. WHAT WOULD YOU BE ON TRIAL FOR ? MIGHT I SAY, THAT FOR YOUR SEXUAL PREDILECTIONS, I BEAR NO GRUDGE, NO MALICE. NOR FOR THE SECRET PRACTICES OF YOUR FRIENDS, NOT MR. HOOVER, NOT HIS EXCELLENCY THE CARDINAL. BUT SHAME, MR. COHN, FOR PERSECUTING IN PUBLIC THOSE WHO IN PRIVATE ARE NO DIFFERENT THAN YOU. I'M NOT GAY. SURE, AND YOU'RE DYING OF MUMPS. I DON'T GIVE A SHIT WHAT YOU THINK. ( McCarthy ) YOU WERE THE LOUSIEST WITNESS I EVER SAW. I GOT A LOT OF THE STAFF OTHER JOBS. I DID THE BEST I COULD. I COULDN'T HELP DAVE, BUT I HELPED THEM. THEY'RE HACKING AT ME ALL AROUND. LONG KNIVES. YOU BROUGHT IT ON YOURSELF. I WARNED YOU. I DID ? YEAH. WHY DON'T YOU TELL THEM ABOUT G. DAVID SCHINE ? YOU WERE GETTING INTO SOMETHING. I JUST COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHETHER IT WAS HIS WALLET OR HIM. HE'S A FRIEND, JOE, AND I WAS LOYAL TO HIM, AS I WAS TO YOU. WANT SOME ? TRY THINKING ABOUT THAT CONCEPT, JOE, BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE GREATNESS LIES. I ALWAYS TRIED TO DO THE RIGHT THING. THE RIGHT THING ? WHAT A DISASTER ! IF, FOR ONE DAY, EVERYBODY IN WASHINGTON TRIED TO DO THE RIGHT THING, YOU'D COME INTO BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS, THERE'D BE MASS SUICIDE. YEAH, WELL, IT DIDN'T USED TO BE THAT WAY. ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME SOMETHING, JOE ? WHAT, THAT I CAUSED THIS ? I DIDN'T INVENT DIRTY TRICKS. NO, YOU DIDN'T. NO, YOU DIDN'T. YOU KIND OF MADE THEM INTO AN ART FORM. LOOK WHAT YOU DID TO ME. HEY. HMM. YOU EVER LISTEN TO BOB AND RAY... MAKING FUN OF ME ? AWFULLY, AWFULLY FUNNY. ( boat man ) ONE OF THE GREATEST LUXURIES YOU CAN HAVE IN NEW YORK CITY IS A YACHT . THE ONLY PLACE A MAN STILL PITS HIS STRENGTH AGAINST THE FORCES OF NATURE. IT'S CLEAN, UNTAINTED. ( Cohn ) I JUST LOVE IT. ( boat man ) YOU LOVE "HER." A BOAT IS ALWAYS A WOMAN. THERE'S A REASON. DO YOU KNOW IT ? ( Cohn ) NO. I'LL TAKE IT. I'LL GIVE YOU A CHECK FOR THE DOWN PAYMENT. WE'LL ARRANGE THE FINANCING. ALL RIGHT. IT'S A STRONG BOAT, DESERVES TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. A LITTLE LOVE WOULDN'T HURT. HOW MANY PEOPLE CAN DANCE ON THAT FRONT PART ? I WOULDN'T KNOW. WHAT'S THAT CALLED ? THE BOW. MY HUSBAND ? HE WAS A PIG. NICE. HE WAS A PIG. BUT I GOT ALL THE CARS IN THE GARAGE, THE GARAGE, THE HOUSE IT WAS ATTACHED TO, THE MAIN HOUSE, AND EVERYTHING IN THAT, THE PICASSOS, THE DOGS, AND THE IBM STOCK OPTIONS, AND DO YOU KNOW WHY ? WHY ? BECAUSE ROY COHN IS THE BEST LAWYER IN NEW YORK. MY DEAR, HE'S A KILLER. SHE KNOWS. ( Iva ) HE'S MY KILLER. ( Cohn ) SHE KNOWS AND SHE'S RIGHT. ( chuckling ) HEY, COHN. RESCUE ME ON THIS. I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU, I HATE TO BRING IT UP. CARMINE. YOU'RE LEAVING ? YOU HATE IT. GOT YOUR COAT ON AFTER THE FIRST ACT. WHY ? THE TENOR'S VOICE IS LIKE RUSTY SKATES. THE SOPRANO'S SKINNY LIKE A BONE YOU THROW TO SOME DOG. I LIKE MEAT ON MY BONE. IVA SCHLESINGER, OUR MOST SATISFIED CLIENT, CARMINE GELANTI. I WORK WITH CARMINE'S ASSOCIATION. CAN WE HAVE A TALK ? CALL ME TOMORROW AT 10:00 AT THE OFFICE-- CAN WE HAVE A LITTLE DISCUSSION, NOW ? OH...AH. I'LL SEE YOU IN A BIT. THIS CAN'T WAIT ? I'M WITH PEOPLE. THE PROBLEM'S A LITTLE COMPLICATED: LEGALITIES. LEGALITY-SHMEGALITY. TELL ME THE JUDGE'S NAME. THAT'S ALL I NEED. I'LL DO THAT, THEN. OKAY. HOW MUCH YOUR BOAT SET YOU BACK ? HOW'D YOU KNOW ABOUT THE BOAT, CARMINE ? YOU CAN ALWAYS COME TO US FOR MONEY. YOU NEED IT, YOU GOT IT. WE'RE FAMILY, RIGHT ? YOU THINK A SMART JEWISH BOY'LL GO TO AN ITALIAN BONE-BREAKING ORGANIZATION FOR MONEY ? ARE YOU MESHUGENEH ? LET ME ASK YOU. FEEL THIS ARM FOR ME. DO I HAVE TO ? GO AHEAD, FEEL IT. MAY I ? DO I WANT THIS ARM AROUND MY NECK GOING, "HEY, WHERE'S OUR MONEY ?" RELAX. WILL YOU TELL HIM TO GET A SUIT THAT FITS ? HE TAKES CARE OF ME. ROY. THE FEE ARRANGEMENT ON YOUR DIVORCE ? YES. I'M STICKING BY IT. IT WAS A DISASTER FOR US. WE OVERSPENT VERY BADLY. THESE SOUTH AFRICAN DIVORCES ARE LIKE QUICKSAND FOR CASH. MY PARTNERSHIP IS CASH POOR. I WAS WONDERING-- HOW MUCH ? $100,000. A LOAN, JUST A LOAN. I CAN DO THAT.

LESS THAN 120,000 ( Cohn ) UNBELIEVABLE. SAY THE POPULATION OF A TOWN ABOUT THE SIZE OF, OF, OF PATTERSON SWINGS THE WHOLE COUNTRY. I'M ALREADY WORKING UP LEGISLATION, THINKING MAYBE I'LL GET IT THROUGH. COME ON, WE'RE DEMOCRATS. SMILE. I'M SMILING. THOSE RICH PRICKS. ROY COHN CAN WORK WITH ANYONE, EVEN THE KENNEDYS. MOLTO BENE . HOW'S THIS COMPARE WITH THE REAL THING IN ITALY ? MUCH BETTER, MUCH MORE ELEGANT, THIS. ELEGANT, YOU BET YOUR ASS IT IS. YEAH, SEE. I CAN DO BUSINESS WITH HIM, IF HE'LL DO BUSINESS WITH ME. IT DEPENDS ON BOBBY. HEY, WALTER. HEY. WHAT DO YOU SAY ? THE PLACE IS DEAD. LIFE IS DOWNHILL. WHO ARE THESE GUYS ? WALTER WINCEHLL, CONGRESSMAN NEIL GALLAGHER. YEAH, NEW JERSEY. MILO GANDINI. WRITE IT DOWN. WHAT IS HE ? I HOPE TO BE A PRODUCT REPRESENTATIVE: MEN'S PERSONAL PRODUCTS, PROFUMO, SHAMPOO. HE'S A MODEL. ( Winchell ) FORGET ABOUT IT. SAY, ROY. YOU HEAR WHAT I HEAR ? KENNEDY IS GOING TO NAME HIS BROTHER ATTORNEY GENERAL. MY FRIEND J. EDGAR SAYS IT'LL BE, "GET HOFFA AND GET COHN." FUCK THE LITTLE COCKSUCKER AND ALL THE SHIPS AT SEA. HEY. I CAN WORK WITH ANYONE. I GOT CONGRESS, RIGHT ? ( doorbell ringing ) WHAT DO YOU WANT HERE ? FBI FOR ROY COHN. BARTLETT, HENDRICKS, STAY AT THE DOOR. MONROE, WHO ARE THESE MEN ? ( Monroe ) I'M SORRY, MRS. COHN, I TRIED-- FBI. WE HAVE A WARRANT FOR ROY MARCUS COHN. YOU HAVE NO RIGHT. MY HUSBAND WAS A NEW YORK STATE JUDGE. WHERE ARE YOU GOING ? ROY ! ROY ! ROY ! ( FBI agent ) I CAN'T GET IN. OH, SHIT. ( FBI agent ) NOTHING DOWN HERE, SIR. SHH SHH SHH. YOU BETTER HAVE A WARRANT. I WANT TO SEE SOME ID. FBI, FEDERAL WARRANT. LET'S TAKE A LOOK. THIS IS ROY COHN. YOU'RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE. JUST WAIT. LET ME JUST READ THIS THING IN THE LIGHT. HELLO. CLYDE TOLSON. WE'VE MET. MR. HOOVER ASKED ME TO COME ALONG THIS MORNING. MR. HOOVER'S A PERSONAL FRIEND OF MY SON'S. HE WOULDN'T APPROVE. MOM. PLEASE. I'D LIKE TO KNOW. MR. HOOVER ASKED ME TO MAKE SURE NOTHING BE TAKEN THAT THE WARRANT DOESN'T CALL FOR. IT'S WRITTEN IN A WAY YOU COULD TAKE ANYTHING AND DOESN'T SPECIFY A GODDAMN THING. UH, MONROE... OPEN THE OFFICE AND LET THEM IN. ( Dora ) WAIT A MINUTE. MOM, THEY'RE WITHIN THEIR RIGHTS. THEY HAVE A WARRANT. MR. HOOVER ALSO ASKED ME TO ASK MR. COHN IF HE WOULD COME DOWN TO WASHINGTON. FOR WHAT ? TO JOIN US FOR DINNER TOMORROW NIGHT. THAT'S NICE, THAT'S BETTER-- WHY DON'T YOU GO IN THE KITCHEN, MAKE COFFEE FOR EVERYBODY. DIO, DIO. AGAIN, I APOLOGIZE, MR. COHN. THANK YOU. BUT WE WERE FORCED TO IMPLEMENT THE DEMANDS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. UNDER THE CURRENT REGIME, WE TAKE OUR MARCHING ORDERS FROM THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, WHETHER WE AGREE OR NOT. IT SEEMS THAT YOU HAVE DISPLEASED THE PRESIDENT'S BROTHER. BOBBY KENNEDY IS A DANGEROUS MAN. HE'S A SPOILED RICH KID THAT NOBODY'S EVER SAID NO TO. AND HIS BROTHER. LOOK, SIR... YOU'VE CREATED THE ONLY FEDERAL AGENCY THAT TRULY WORKS. IT GIVES THE PEOPLE VALUE FOR THEIR TAX DOLLARS. YOU ARE THE ONLY FEDERAL EXECUTIVE THAT PEOPLE KNOW AND TRULY RESPECT. YOU ARE A HERO, SIR. THANK YOU. I THINK YOU OVERSTATE, BUT YES, AND CALL ME JOHN. MY POINT IS, JOHN, THE KENNEDY ADMINISTRATION WILL RESENT YOUR INDEPENDENCE. THEY'LL WANT TO, AND I UNDERSTAND HUMAN NATURE, PUT YOU UNDER BOBBY'S HEEL. BOBBY WANTS ME OUT. ( Cohn ) WHICH WOULD BE A CATASTROPHE FOR THIS COUNTRY. WHAT I NEED TO KNOW, IS THERE ANY WAY THAT I CAN BE OF HELP-- THAT I CAN BE... A SOLDIER IN YOUR ARMY ? DID YOU EVER HEAR THE WAY JIMMY DURANTE SAYS CATASTROPHE ? "A CATASTRASTROKE." A GREAT ENTERTAINER. MR. COHN, WE'D LIKE TO PLAY A SHORT ENTERTAINMENT FOR YOU. ( moaning ) THE SOUND OF MARTIN LUTHER KING IN A MOTEL. YOU NOTICE THAT COMMUNISTS MAKE THE SAME TELLTALE SOUNDS AS PATRIOTS. ROBERT KENNEDY HAS ORDERED US TO BUG KING'S HOTEL ROOM WHEREVER HE GOES. AND NOT JUST MR. KING. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT AMERICANS WOULD THINK IF THEY KNEW THEIR GOLDEN BOY LIBERAL HERO PUT MICROPHONES IN MARTIN LUTHER KING'S BEDROOM ? I'M NOT WORRIED. YOU SEE, I'VE BEEN DOING THIS SINCE 1924. I'VE SEEN HOTSHOTS IN THE WHITE HOUSE COME AND I'VE CERTAINLY SEEN THEM GO: 6 OF THEM. THIS ONE HAS 7 MORE YEARS MAXIMUM, AND THEN HE'LL BE GONE, TOO. MEANWHILE, MY FILES ARE A GREAT SOURCE OF COMFORT AND PROTECTION. THIS PARTICULAR TAPE I OFFER TO YOU. WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH IT ? "AS CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE "FOR THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY--" THIS IS NOT-- "I HEREWITH DEMAND THAT YOU, ROBERT KENNEDY--" YOU'RE CRAZY ! JUST... "PRODUCE THE AUTHORIZATION "FOR THE ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE "OF MARTIN LUTHER KING." WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU CAN CALL MY SECRETARY AND DICTATE A LETTER LIKE THIS ? THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO: INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY. I'M ONE LITTLE MEMBER OF CONGRESS. THIS STUFF-- "IS AN OUTRAGE. I AM OUTRAGED BY THIS." IT ISN'T NEWS. HOOVER'S BEEN TAPING EVERYBODY HE DOESN'T LIKE FOR YEARS. HE HAS MORE TAPE THAN 3M. ( Cohn ) HOOVER ? I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM. HE HAS NOTHING TO DO. LISTEN, LISTEN. FORGET HOOVER. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION-- DON'T DO THAT. SINCE WHEN ARE YOU THE PROTECTOR OF OUR CIVIL RIGHTS ? HOOVER PLAYS THESE TAPES AT PARTIES. PRESIDENTS CAN'T STOP HIM. I CAN'T STOP HIM. FORGET ABOUT HOOVER. THE POINT IS, YES, THIS IS THE POINT: IF AMERICANS AREN'T SECURE IN THE PRIVACY OF THEIR OWN BEDROOMS FROM POLICE-STATE TACTICS OF THE WHITE HOUSE, THEN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT IS DEAD. THE CONSTITUTION, THE BILL OF RIGHTS ARE DEAD. NO ONE IS SAFE. THE GOVERNMENT IS OVERTHROWN. AND YOU HAVEN'T STOOD UP AND SAID OR DONE A DAMN THING ABOUT IT. THIS IS FUNNY, RIGHT ? OKAY, ROY, I UNDERSTAND. YOU DON'T WANT BOBBY KENNEDY IN YOUR BEDROOM UNINVITED. YEAH. I DON'T WANT BOBBY KENNEDY ANYWHERE. THIS SHIT IS TOO DEEP FOR ME. FORGET IT. NEIL ? I SURE HOPE YOU DON'T HAVE ANY SKELETONS IN YOUR CLOSET. BECAUSE BOY, DO THEY HAVE A WAY OF COMING OUT. OKAY. OKAY. I ACCEPT THAT AS A THREAT. YOU LEAVE ME ALONE, PAL. IN FACT, YOU STAY AWAY FROM ME. WE'RE ENDED. DON'T ! WHOO HOO... WHOO... WHOO... HE SAID IT WAS A THREAT ? ( Cohn ) Yes, sir, a threat. IT'S CLEAR HE DOESN'T HAVE THE GUTS TO GO AGAINST THE KENNEDYS. NEIL GALLAGHER. THAT'S RIGHT. WE'LL TAKE THIS ONE STEP AT A TIME. NEIL GALLAGHER. NEIL GALLAGHER. ( phone ringing ) MR. COHN'S OFFICE. I GOT IT. MR. COHN. ROY, IT'S IVA. IVA, SO NICE TO HEAR FROM YOU. YOU'VE BEEN WONDERFUL ? WELL, ALMOST. LOOK, YOU KNOW YOUR LETTER ABOUT MY LOAN ? THERE MUST BE A MISUNDERSTANDING. I DON'T THINK SO. COULD WE DO THIS AT SOME LATER... You refer to it as a payment for services. IT WAS A LOAN, YOU REMEMBER. And I do need it-- YOU KNOW, I-I-IVA, IF THERE'S BEEN A MISTAKE, WE'LL FIND IT, ALL RIGHT ? THIS IS REALLY A BAD TIME. WHERE'S COHN ? OUT OF MY WAY. WHAT ? NEIL. SON OF A BITCH. WAIT. READ IT. READ IT ! YOU KNEW ABOUT IT. YOU AND THAT BASTARD HOOVER YOU LOVE SO MUCH. LIFE MAGAZINE ? WHAT'S THIS ABOUT ? IT'S NEWS TO ME. IT'S AN FBI PLANT, TYING ME IN WITH THE MAFIA. DEAD BODIES IN MY BASEMENT ? CHRIST, WHAT A STORY ! HOOVER'S COMPLETELY-- GET OUT OF HERE ! HOOVER IS COMPLETELY OUT OF HIS MIND. HE WAITED UNTIL I'M RUNNING FOR RE-ELECTION AND THEN BANG ! DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS'LL DO, HOW I'LL BE KILLED BY THIS ? MY WHOLE CAREER, MY REPUTATION. I DON'T FORGET WHEN I'M THREATENED, YOU LITTLE COCKSUCKER. WHY DON'T YOU JUST DO WHAT HE WANTS ? OH, NO, NO, NO. I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I'LL DO. LET ME EXPLAIN IT-- DON'T ! IF I HAVE TO CHOOSE WHO I WANT FOR AN ENEMY, THE U.S. PRESIDENT AND HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL BROTHER, OR J. EDGAR HOOVER, THAT'S EASY. GIVE THIS TO YOUR G-MAN. NO NEGOTIATIONS. GET OUT OF MY WAY. IVA, COULD I CALL YOU BACK IN JUST 2 MINUTES ? THANK YOU. ( Gallagher ) "AS A MEMBER OF THE CONGRESS, "IT IS NOT MY INCLINATION "TO JUDGE THE SEXUAL PROCLIVITIES "OF ANY PUBLIC SERVANT OR ANYBODY ELSE. "HOWEVER, IT'S BEEN CALLED TO MY ATTENTION "THAT THE DIRECTOR OF THE FBI "AND THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE FBI "HAVE BEEN LIVING TOGETHER AS MAN AND WIFE" "FOR THE PAST 28 YEARS AT THE PUBLIC'S EXPENSE. "NOW, ROY, I'VE LISTED NEAT LITTLE THINGS "LIKE THE ARMORED CAR THAT PICKS THEM UP AT THE AIRPORT, "TAKES THEM TO A HOTEL WHERE THEY SPEND "THE TAXPAYERS' TIME AND MONEY DIDDLING EACH OTHER." EVERY DAY AT NOON, AS YOU KNOW, SIR, ANY MEMBER OF THE CONGRESS CAN MAKE A SPEECH ON ANY SUBJECT HE WISHES. YES. EVERY SINGLE DAY, GALLAGHER WILL BE MAKING THIS SPEECH... UNTIL ELECTION DAY. AND... HE WANTS YOU TO GET LIFE MAGAZINE TO PRINT A RETRACTION ON THE STORY ABOUT THE BODIES BURIED IN HIS BASEMENT. ( clearing throat ) IT'LL BE DONE. HOW WILL WE GET BOBBY KENNEDY ? GO AWAY. PLEASE, GO, MR. COHN. I'VE BEEN OF USE TO YOU. ROY. I THINK IT'S TIME YOU GO. BOBBY KENNEDY. YOU WERE AFTER ME AND YOU WERE AFTER HOFFA. "GET HOFFA AND GET COHN." YOU THINK I'M STUPID ? WHY ME ? YOU WERE NO ANGEL. HAD McCARTHY STOPPED SHORT, YOU'D HAVE BEEN UP HIS ASS. BUT I LEARNED SOMETHING. I LEARNED. YOU NEVER LEARNED. WHAT A MISERABLE LITTLE MAN YOU ARE. FOR ONE, BRIBING WITNESSES, INTIMIDATING WITNESSES, THREATENING WITNESSES, FALSE TESTIMONY INTRODUCED INTO A COURT OF LAW. BRIBING WITNESSES, INTIMIDATING WITNESSES, THREATENING WITNESSES, MANUFACTURING EVIDENCE, GIVING EVASIVE, FICTITIOUS, VAGUE FALSE, MISLEADING AND MANUFACTURED TESTIMONY, AND CORRUPTLY, BY THREATS AND OFFERS, ATTEMPTING TO INFLUENCE, IMPEDE AND FRUSTRATE INVESTIGATIONS BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. HOW DOES MR. COHN PLEAD ? MY CLIENT PLEADS-- NOT GUILTY TO 48 OF THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS, OUTLANDISH, EGREGIOUS, MALICIOUS, CONCOCTED, SURREPTITIOUS, SOLICITOUS, SUPERCILIOUS, OUTRAGEOUS, MENDACIOUS CHARGES I HAVE EVER HEARD IN THIS COURT. THANK YOU FOR MAKING YOUR POINT SO CLEARLY, MR. COHN. BAIL RECOMMENDATIONS, MR. WALPIN ? I SUGGEST-- IN THE MATTER OF BAIL, THE GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO RELEASE THE DEFENDANT INTO HIS OWN RECOGNIZANCE. OH, OH. WHAT'S THE CATCH ? WE WOULD LIKE THE DEFENDANT FINGERPRINTED, YOUR HONOR. HE WANTS FINGERPRINTS, PHOTOGRAPHS, MUG SHOTS. ( gavel banging ) YOU MAY DO SO. THANK YOU. YOU'RE MOST WELCOME. DID I MENTION SEMEN SAMPLES, STOOL SPECIMENS, BLOOD COUNTS, WHITE-BLOOD-CELL COUNTS, PAP SMEARS, IRRIGATION OF THE TONSILS ? HOW DID IT FEEL TO HAVE A WHOLE ARM OF THE GOVERNMENT REACHING OUT FOR YOUR THROAT FOR A CHANGE ? I LIKED IT. MAKE SURE THAT GOES IN OUR LITTLE COURT RECORD HERE TODAY. THE CHALLENGE INVIGORATED ME. GAVE ROY A HARD ON. ( Walpin ) MR. GARFIELD, DID THERE COME A TIME WHEN MR. COHN INDICATED TO YOU THE PAYMENT HAD ALREADY BEEN MADE ? ( Garfield ) HE SAID THAT HE NEEDED ANOTHER $40,000 FOR PAYMENT OF BRIBES. DID HE SPECIFY HOW THE $40,000 WAS TO BE DISTRIBUTED ? HE SAID $10,000 EACH FOR 2 WITNESSES AND ANOTHER $20,000 FOR AN ASSISTANT PROSECUTOR. OBJECTION. I'D NEVER PAY AN ASSISTANT PROSECUTOR MORE THAN $50. ARE YOU NUTS ? MR. COHN ? YES, SIR ? MR. COHN ? SIT DOWN. IF YOU ARE LATE ONE MORE TIME, I'LL PUT YOU INTO CUSTODY. I APOLOGIZE, YOUR HONOR. $20,000 ? THE GUY'S DREAMING. HEARSAY. IT'S ALL HEARSAY. JESUS, ROY. RELAX, WILL YOU ? ( judge ) IS THERE ANY MORE ? NO. ( Cohn ) SMART MOVE. MR. RAICHLE, FINISH THE REBUTTAL. SEE THAT BLACK GIRL, THE JUROR ? SHE'S GOING TO SLICE ME UP AND SERVE ME ON TOAST. YOU USED UP YOUR CHALLENGES TOO FAST. BLACKS HATE ME. I'LL NEVER DEFEND ANOTHER LAWYER. YOU WON'T DEFEND ME AGAIN. MR. GARFIELD, IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT BEING SUDDENLY CONFRONTED WITH ADDITIONAL COSTS, FOR WHATEVER PURPOSE, IS UPSETTING ? YEAH, IT WAS. INFURIATING ? DID IT MAKE YOU ANGRY AT THE DEFENDANT ? ME ? NO, I REALLY DO LOVE THE GUY. BUT THIS IS BUSINESS. I'VE GOT TO TELL THE TRUTH. ( Cohn chuckling ) I LOVE YOU, TOO, GARFIELD. MMWA. YOUR HONOR. RELAX. I'M SORRY, I REALLY DO APOLOGIZE. IT WAS JUST THE SINCERITY AND GOODWILL OF THE WITNESS. I ALMOST CRIED. IT BROKE MY HEART. MR. COHN, WHILE I AM ON THIS BENCH, YOU WILL OBSERVE THE RULES OF THIS COURT. BOBBY KENNEDY. THIS IS KENNEDY'S COURT. IT HAS ITS OWN RULES. YOU ARE PERILOUSLY CLOSE TO CONTEMPT. ( dance music playing ) HI. REMEMBER ME ? PETER. SAY SOMETHING NICE TO ME. EVEN WHEN YOU'RE SAD, YOU'RE VERY EXCITING. EVEN WHEN YOU'RE LYING... SO ARE YOU. LAST TIME I WAS HERE, YOU DANCED WITH ME, WITH EVERYONE. IT WAS A GREAT NIGHT. AFTER READING ABOUT YOUR TRIAL AND TRIBULATIONS, DO YOU WANT TO HEAR AN OPTIMISTIC WORD ? BE AN OPTIMIST FOR ME TONIGHT. I DON'T THINK A FIRST CLASS BASTARD LIKE YOU WILL GET BEAT BY A BUNCH OF AMATEURS. ( judge ) MR. COHN, YOU HAVE BEEN CONSISTENTLY AND ARROGANTLY UNPUNCTUAL. I AM PREPARED TO CITE YOU FOR, UH, FAILURE TO, UH... MR. RAICHLE, YOUR CLIENT MAY... WOULD YOU LIKE TO REQUEST POSTPONING THESE PROCEEDINGS ? NOT AT ALL, I THINK THIS COURT HAS PROCEEDED IN A TOUGH, HONORABLE, NEW FRONTIER KIND OF WAY. ARE YOU IN PAIN ? IT'S JUST THESE DRAINAGE SACS, THE STITCHES. IT'S JUST FROM A LITTLE COSMETIC SURGERY I HAD. JUST A LITTLE NIP AND A TUCK. BUT IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE, I'M PREPARED TO DO SO. VERY WELL. PLEASE RESUME THE STAND. MR. RAICHLE, ARE YOU PREPARED TO CONTINUE WITH THE QUESTIONING ? YES, YOUR HONOR. THIS COURT'S CALLED TO ORDER. THE WITNESS IS REMINDED THAT HE IS STILL UNDER OATH. MR. COHN, WHEN WE ADJOURNED, YOU WERE DESCRIBING YOUR DUTIES AS COUNSEL TO SENATOR McCARTHY'S COMMITTEE. WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF THAT COMMITTEE'S INVESTIGATION ? TO UNCOVER COMMUNIST INFILTRATION IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT. WHO WAS THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY AT THAT TIME ? HENRY MORGENTHAU, JR. IS HE THE FATHER OF THE PRESENT U.S. ATTORNEY WHO'S BROUGHT CHARGES AGAINST YOU ? YES. HE'S BEEN CONSPIRING WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, ROBERT KENNEDY, EVER SINCE I INVESTIGATED THE TRANSFER OF MONEY PLATES... GET INTO IT. OBJECTION. FOR RUSSIA, UNDER HIS FATHER. THEY ASKED, THEY MUST HAVE SET A RECORD, LIKE 8,450-- OBJECTION. THE DEFENDANT CAN'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THE MIND OF MR. MORGENTHAU OR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. QUESTIONS ABOUT MY PERSONAL AND PRIVATE LIFE. THE DATE I HAD MY ADENOIDS REMOVED. SUSTAINED. THE OBJECTION IS SUSTAINED. SUSTAINED. MY FIRST ERECTION, ANYTHING TO TRY, YOUR HONOR, TO TRY TO TRAP ME, AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY GOT ? NOTHING. YOU GOT NOTHING, RIGHT ? YOU WANT MY BLOOD ? HERE, TAKE IT. THE OBJECTION IS SUSTAINED. IT IS SUSTAINED. YOU KNOW BETTER. YOU'RE A LAWYER. ARE YOU QUITE THROUGH ? THEY'RE NOT GOING TO FINISH ME THAT EASILY. THESE REMARKS'LL BE STRICKEN FROM THE RECORD AND THE JURY WILL DISREGARD THEM. EVERY SINGLE PROSECUTION WITNESS IS A CONVICTED FELON GIVEN IMMUNITY. DON'T YOU SEE THAT EVEN THE STUPIDEST JURY IN THE WORLD WILL KNOW THEY'VE ALL MADE THEIR DEALS ? THEY'D SAY ANYTHING. DON'T YOU THINK THE JURY KNOWS THAT ? DAMN RIGHT. EVEN MY FATHER WOULD FIND FOR ME. HMM. EVEN HIM. YOU WANT A CHARACTER WITNESS NOW ? I WAS FOUND GUILTY, ROY, BUT WAS I GUILTY ? THE JURY DETERMINES THE GUILT. I PRESENTED THE FACTS. THEY DECIDED YOU WERE GUILTY. DID YOU DO IT ? I DON'T KNOW. WHO KNOWS ? WHO CARES ? WHATEVER HAPPENED TO RIGHT OR WRONG ? I DON'T KNOW. YOU NEVER DID KNOW. ( man ) THE JUDGE WANTS TO SEE YOU. THE JUDGE ? ( judge ) THE FATHER OF JUROR NUMBER 9 WAS KILLED IN AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT EARLY THIS MORNING. I HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT SHE SHOULD BE TOLD. OPINIONS ? THE JURY IS CLOSE TO A VERDICT. A FEW HOURS MORE, POSSIBLY LESS. IF THE FATHER WERE ILL, WE MIGHT AGREE, BUT-- IF HE'S DEAD, STOPPING NOW WON'T BRING THE GIRL'S FATHER BACK. SHE JUST LOST HER FATHER ! LET HIS LAWYER SPEAK. I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU. STOP IT. UNLESS THEY'VE BEEN LISTENING AT THE DOOR, THEY DON'T KNOW WHEN THE VERDICT'S COMING. 9 IS THE BLACK GIRL. YOU'VE GOT TO TELL A PERSON THAT THEIR FATHER DIED. OR WHAT ? ROY COHN GOES ON NATIONAL TELEVISION AND TELLS THE WORLD THAT THESE PRICKS WANT HIM IN JAIL SO BADLY THEY'LL PUT A JUROR'S FATHER IN THE GROUND AND NOT TELL HER ? ( Walpin ) THAT'S THREATENING THE COURT WITH BLACKMAIL. WAIT. SHOULD I CHOOSE TO INFORM HER, WOULD BOTH SIDES AGREE TO ALLOW 11 JURORS TO BRING OUT A VERDICT ? NOT EVEN REMOTELY. THE DEFENSE WOULD NOT AGREE. MUMSY ! THE SYSTEM WORKS ! I BEAT THE BASTARDS ! MUMSY ! THIS IS A GREAT COUNTRY, MONROE. EQUAL JUSTICE FOR ALL. YES ! MUMSY ! MUTTI ! MUTTI ! YOUR LITTLE FROG PRINCE HAS DONE IT AGAIN. MUTTI, MUTTI, SLEEPING BEAUTY. ( slow instrumental music ) ( speaking Hebrew ) YIS-GA-DAL, V'YIS-KA-DASH. DORA, I LOVE YOU. GOODBYE. WE HEREBY CONSECRATE YOUR ASHES TO THE WINDS AND WATERS OF THE WORLD FROM WHICH THEY HAVE COME. AND NEW JERSEY, FROM WHICH YOU DIDN'T. I'M MOST DECIDEDLY NOT SUBORNING PERJURY . MAYBE THE GUY'S MEMORY COULD BE LESS ACUTE THAN IT WAS DURING THE DEPOSITION. SORRY, MR. COHN. THANK YOU. OH. WELL, AT LEAST MONROE HASN'T FORGOTTEN ME, THOUGH APPARENTLY YOU HAVE. I NEED TO SPEAK TO YOU. CAN YOU HOLD ON A SECOND ? HOW DARE YOU NOT RETURN MY CALLS ! THAT'S BECAUSE I DON'T ACCEPT THREATS. I'D BE CAREFUL WITH ME. YOU WANT TO KEEP ME AS A FRIEND. WHAT DID YOU CALL YOURSELF ? A FRIEND ? YOU STOLE MY MONEY, LIED TO ME. WOULD YOU PUT DOWN THE PHONE ? CAN I CALL YOU BACK ? IT WAS YEARS AGO. YOU DON'T REMEMBER-- I HAVE THE IOU. IT'S SIGNED, "ROY COHN." ALL RIGHT ? THE DIVORCE ? GOING TO WHEREVER IT WAS, SOUTH AFRICA, IT ATE UP-- PLEASE ! YOU CAN SCARE IMPORTANT MEN, THEY KNOW HOW DANGEROUS YOU ARE TO THEM, BUT YOU DON'T SCARE ME. I'M SHELTERED. I'M SHELTERED ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT I'M RIGHT AND IF YOU'RE WRONG, YOU'RE WRONG. THAT'LL BE ENOUGH. THAT IS NEVER ENOUGH. FROM THE BEST LEGAL MIND IN NEW YORK, THIS PIECE OF ADVICE IS FREE: IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO BE RIGHT. FIGHT ME, IVA. BECAUSE ROY COHN NEVER LOSES. REALLY ? WE'LL JUST SEE ABOUT THAT. WHY DO I FEEL LIKE CALIGULA ? BECAUSE I TREAT YOU LIKE AN EMPEROR. RIGHT. OH, WAIT...AAH, AAH. LOOK AT WHAT YOU DID TO ME ! SORRY. I DON'T THINK-- DUMB QUEER. LOOK AT THIS. PUT THIS ON. THAT'S NICE. RELAX. IT'S FINE, IT STOPPED BLEEDING. IT STOPPED. AAH. I'M SORRY. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU ? HAS IT STOPPED ? MY GOD. GOD. HOLD ON. GIVE ME SOMETHING QUICK. WHAT DID YOU DO ? GIVE ME SOMETHING. PUT THIS ON. CALM DOWN. IT'S FINE, IT'S FINE. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU ? THAT LOOKS BETTER. THAT'S FINE. THAT'S OKAY. I'LL JUST PUT A LITTLE PRESSURE ON IT. GOD. GOD ! GOD. IS IT ALL RIGHT ? NO, IT'S BLEEDING. OH, GOD. OH, MY GOD ! IS IT OKAY ? DO SOMETHING. CALL THE DOCTOR ! DAMN DOCTORS. SOME QUESTIONS THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO ASK. WHAT QUESTIONS ? ABOUT MY LIFE. IT'S NOT HIS BUSINESS. WHERE TO ? ANYWHERE. JUST DRIVE. SORRY ABOUT THE BAD NEWS, SIR. BAD NEWS ? HOW DID YOU HEAR ? IT'S ON THE RADIO. RADIO ? WHAT'S ON THE RADIO ? THE STATE IS BRINGING DISBARMENT PROCEEDINGS AGAINST YOU. IT'S ON RADIO AND TV. WHAT ELSE DID THEY SAY ? THEY MENTIONED IV-I-I... IVA SCHLESINGER ? YES, SIR. THAT COW. AAH. AAH. AAH. I GOTTA GO. WHAT'S HE DOING NOW ? CAN YOU... I HAVE TO GO TO COURT. THEY'RE TRYING TO DISBAR ME. THE HEARINGS ARE OVER, DARLING, ALL OVER. DID I WIN ? NO. NO ? THEY DISBARRED ME ? OH, THEY DID. WHY WERE YOU SO NAUGHTY ? WHY ? WHY DID YOU GET ME, HMM ? BECAUSE I WAS A WOMAN ? NO. BECAUSE I WAS A JEW ? NO. I KILLED YOU FOR THE HEADLINES, FOR THE FUCKING HEADLINES. YOU DON'T REMEMBER ? I'VE GOTTA GO. THE LAST STAGES: IT GETS IN THE BRAIN, YOU KNOW ? ( Kennedy ) JUSTICE. JUSTICE HAS A WAY... JUSTICE. THE FACT IS, HE NEVER FOUND A COMMUNIST. HE NEVER FOUND A COMMUNIST. I HAVE A LIST. YES. A COMMUNIST, YOU WERE A COMMUNIST ! A LIST THE LENGTH OF WHICH IS JUST AMAZING TO BEHOLD. IT'S YOU, PIXIE ! I KNEW WHAT YOU WERE. YOU WERE A COMMUNIST WITH YOUR SUNSPOTS. I GOT YOUR SUN... AND YOU, YOU DRUNK. I DON'T NEED ANY DRUNKEN... LOOK AT YOU NOW. ( Black juror ) WHY DON'T YOU HELP HIM ? HE'S DEAD. HE WILL BE SOON. FUCK THAT. YOU KNOW WHO THIS IS ? THE LITTLE GIRL I DIDN'T WANT ON THE JURY. BUT THEN HER FATHER GOT KILLED, AND I GOT SAVED. MY FATHER DIDN'T NEED TO DIE, MR. COHN. HE DIED FOR MY SINS. I WAS THE ONLY JUROR WHO WOULD'VE SAVED YOU. I WOULD'VE SAVED YOU. I WOULD'VE VOTED FOR YOU. YOU WERE ALL ALONE IN THAT COURT, NOBODY ON YOUR SIDE. THEY WERE ALL AFTER YOU. I KNOW HOW THAT FEELS. WAIT. WAIT. DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE THREW MY ASHES IN ? THE EAST RIVER ! YOU WOULDN'T LET YOUR DOG SWIM IN IT. MA... AND YET, HE'S MINE. YOU'RE MINE. I DIDN'T MAKE YOU THE WAY YOU ARE. YOU DID. YOU MADE A MONSTER. WHY ? LOOKING FOR THE... WHY ? A CONFESSION ? WHY I LIVED THE WAY... JEW THAT PERSECUTED JEWS. GAY THAT CRUCIFIED GAYS. I PRACTICED LAW BEFORE THE GREATEST COURTS AND STOLE, CHEATED FROM EVERYONE. I HAD A FULL LIFE. ( chuckling ) THAT'S WHY. ( chuckling ) I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT. DID WHATEVER I WANTED TO DO. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU LET ME GET AWAY WITH IT. MR. COHN... HAVE YOU NO SENSE OF MORTALITY, SIR, AT LONG LAST ? WILL YOU NOT RID US OF YOUR PRESENCE ? THEY NEED THE ROOM. ( beeping ) AAH. HEY, WHERE ARE THEY ALL GOING ? WE'RE NOT THROUGH YET, ARE WE ? I NEED... I NEED TO FILE AN EXTENSION. DORA, MUTTI , MOM ? DON'T LEAVE ME. DON'T LET THEM TAKE ME. THEY CAN'T CATCH ME. I'M THE GINGERBREAD BOY. ROY, ROY. ( steady beeping ) NURSE ? NURSE !
