'Om Namo Narayanaya' 'God created all beings in this universe.' 'He gave the power of intellect only to humans,' 'which is not there in other animals or birds.' 'With that intelligence,' 'mankind discovered many parts in this earth.' 'Went around the globe.' 'He was proud that he could touch' 'every part of this earth with satellite.' 'But there are many secrets that are beyond his knowledge.' 'There are many stories that the modern man does not know about.' 'There are still many unknown people and places on this earth.' We have walked so far. Still could not find any town. Have we lost our way in the dark? I cannot walk anymore. Even I cannot walk. Chant Lord Rama's name and walk. His devotee Hanuman will help us. Can see light there. Let us go and see. - Come. Sir, can we take rest here and then go? Sage, is sleeping. Do not disturb. Which place is this? The place where God lives. He must be God. Mother, he is not God. Then why did he say that it is God? No problem. We got a place to stay in an old man's ashram. Who is this sage? Who told you that he is not God? Is he God? Have you seen God? Have you seen? Whether God or humans. Those who are alive because of their principles. Their thoughts make them immortal. Is he alive? His ideals are alive. People who believed in those ideals have survived. What is that ideal? Life is God's creation. We do not have the right to take it. It is the dharma of humans to protect others. That is the greatest principle. Who is he, sage? You should first understand about waves to cross the ocean. He is the God who loves everyone. He is the God of peace. He believed that helping the poor is the greatest service. He taught love amidst human struggles. He is the messenger of peace. Hello, sir. Muthu. I am Manimuthu. I will carry your luggage if you pay ten rupees. If you give fifteen rupees, I will carry you. I like your approach. I will give you fifty rupees. Carry my luggage. I can carry myself. - Okay sir. Which place is this? This is a stone, our place of worship. What is happening? My sister is possessed by spirit. Please save them. "Pray to God" "Pray to God" "Pray to God" My God! Didn't the boy say that his sister is possessed by spirit? Guru knows who has been possessed by spirit. Is it? - Yes. Excuse me. Is this an illusion or reality? Do these spells and magic black really exist? Evil power is as true as divine power. Did that sorcerer capture the spirit on the boy in that vessel? You should not say 'sorcerer' Say 'Guru'. Both are same. A wizard uses his magical powers to destroy someone for his selfish needs. Uses them for money. But our Guru keeps the spirits that he has captured safely, with his power. At the right time, he frees them from this earth. Will those spirits not harm Guruji? If anyone helps you, will you harm him? No. - Even spirits are like that. In that case a sorcerer can take money and give life to a dead body with the spirit. It is impossible. Can Guru do it? - No. Spirits can be used only on a living person. Not on a dead person. Then no one can do it. It is possible. Only one person can inject spirit into a dead body. Who is he? Bless you. Thank you. Sir, you have not revealed the identity of the person. Do you know? Okay. Come along. Sir, this is Alamelamma's house. You rascals! I will thrash you. You dogs! I curse your family. You will fall ill and die. Rogues! Are you playing tricks with me? In this town, who has the courage to oppose me? I make laws here. I rule. Tell me, you rascals. When will you return the interest money? Madam, we will return after the harvest. Shut up. Should I wait till the harvest is over? Stay and work here till you repay the loan. Otherwise you know the consequences. You will suffer. Sister! Sister! Child! Child! Sister, do not call me 'child'. Call me Anji. You have come to see me after such a long time. Has mother not come? No. She is still angry with me. Never mind. - Brother-in-law! We are happy that you have come to our house. I always think of you. Oh I see! That is why I was getting hiccups at night. I mean. hiccups. How come you have come here all of a sudden? What to do, brother-in-law? A crucial situation came up. Is mother fine? Mother is good. Then? - For me. You? What happened? Nothing happened. What do you mean? - Marriage. Ah! Are you still not married? Sister, stop screaming. Be cool. A person should get married in time. Only then it will look good. Brother-in-law, you should not say this now. Hey! Go. You say. - That... Mother told me to come to you. She asked you to find a good bride for me. So I have come. What? Did my mother say that? Did she say that? - Yes. This will do. Wait and see. Not only in this surrounding villages. In any village or town, on earth or sky. Everyone will be surprised to see her beauty. I will get such a beautiful girl for you. Hey! Yes madam. He will choose his own wife! - Yeah. Decoction? We showed him to many doctors. But his cough did not stop. Do you think this decoction made of herbs and roots will help him? Doctor is God. 'When the Devas and Demons churned the ocean,' 'at first poison came out.' 'Then came Kamadhenu, the divine cow.' 'Then came the Ucchaisharavas, seven headed horse.' 'Then Airavata, elephant.' 'Kaustubha... Kalpa tree...' 'Then Mahalaxmi was born.' 'Finally Mahavishnu came with couch' 'and nectar in the form of Dhanvantri.' 'Devas became immortal after drinking nectar.' When humans were affected by diseases, God created people from the family of Dhanvantris, on earth, to treat them. Are they still there? What happened to them, sage? They went missing. Thrash and kill him. Offering of blood to a deserving man. I like it. Like it. Well done, Araka. There is no one equal to you. Nobody has your strength. Even a tiger's roar is inferior to your courage. No man, who can fight and defeat you, has ever born on this earth. Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Come. This is not the one. I want a more stronger drug. I tried a lot but could not get. Have you not got? You have not got. Right? You were doing before. Why are you not able to do now? Go and search everywhere. Bring. They are not available. I searched but could not get the herbs that you want. The time has come for them to meet. This is the result of our effort. Who is he, sage? He drank the hot fire. Who is Araka? What is he searching for? Down! Down! Down! Down! Down! Down! Down! Down! Down! Down! Down with atrocities! Down! Down! Down! Down! Down with atrocities! Down! Down! Down with atrocities! Down! Down! Down with atrocities! Alamelamma! Down! Down! Down! Down! They are running away. Cowards. Oh God. Come here. Madam, let us not go. Come here, I say. Rama! Yes madam. A dog has come in front of our house. Hit it with a stone and drive it away. Okay sister. Hay! Alamelamma! Hit me if you have the courage. People who came with you have run away. But I am not coward like them. Hay! Look. I am Chinminiki. You were born yesterday. I will crush you. Hey! Hey! Amma. - Tell me, sister. She is acting smart. Beat her into a pulp. Alright sister. You swindle people by charging high interest. I will put an end to it. It is a challenge. Otherwise will change my name Chinminiki. Come on. Run. Sister, she ran away. Boss. I have got whatever I needed. I got it. I got my treasure. Araka, We are dealing in drug business since generations from this forest. This forest has been protecting us. Not the city. You should never get out of this forest for any reason. It is my responsibility to sell the drugs. Hey, shame on you. You are giving a cheap item. Sage, listen to us. We want a drug that will give us 'kick'. An item that will give us 'kick'. The smell must make us intoxicated. This is the item that will intoxicate us. This piece of wood? It is a local drug. It has been there since the time of my forefathers. We will not get it anywhere else. If people use it once, they will fall for it. Is it so? - Yes. Come. Let us see how it works. Doddu! We trap people by giving drugs. But this sage is trying to outwit us. Many items like powder, ganja and opium are introduced to market daily. Let me see if your item can beat them or turn into a flop. Come on. No, Araka. Do not harm him. He will surely come in search of us. Bad habits are more on this earth than good ones. People who used their drugs were elated. They became slaves of that drug. Their intoxication increased. Alamelu, I am happy that you have agreed to our alliance. From now we will do this loan business in a large scale. Two wicked women have united. Alamelu, Is this fellow your brother? His face is scratched. He is Banta, my right hand. He collects interest. Wait. I will call my brother. Call him. Child. Child? - Child. If he is a child, who am I? Sister, why are you calling me 'child' again? Who are they? What is this? I told you yesterday that they are coming to see the groom. Has she come to do human parts business? You are fit. Thank God. She has spared him. Sister, who is the girl? Hoovamma, he wants to know who the girl is. Who? - My darling! My dear! Can't you make out by seeing my face? I am the girl. I am the bride. - What? I will bear 3-4 children for you. Play with them with toys and enjoy. What is the toy she is referring to? That toy makes sound when you move it. Be careful. She will sell you if she doesn't have money for mutton. Yes. Should I marry this bean bag? - Yes. Do not look at her physical appearance. Look at her wealth. What nonsense? Should I marry her for profit and get controlled by her like a remote in her hands? Even I have got a heart. Do not treat me like a toy. Alamelu, the child is speaking for long. What is he saying? Do not call me a child. Call me Anji. Anji. Shit! Hay! What are you doing? Keep quiet. Hey, get up. Take your things. She is like a pumpkin. Do you want to make her his wife? Alamelu, I thought your husband is a handicapped person. But he has become courageous. Shut up. I am keeping quiet because you are a woman. Otherwise. I do not deserve to be treated like this. I will not enter a place where I do not get respect. What are you staring at? Come. Let us go. Hey Hoovamma! Hay! Have you gone crazy? You have spoiled a good alliance. Keep quiet. He is your younger brother. You are spoiling his life due to your greed for money. You eloped from your house. Your mother is hurt that her daughter left the house. It is due to that curse the God has punished me. You are childless. It is due to the curse of your mother. If parents' cry, it is not good for the children. After all these years, she has forgiven you. She has given you the responsibility of getting your brother married. Do that properly. Son. you go away from here. Otherwise she will spoil your life. Go away. Sister, I am sorry. I will go back. Bye. No, dear. You marry the girl you like. It is my responsibility to get you married to the girl you like. See there. They are going to collect interest money. Who is the person sitting at the back? He is the younger brother of that moneylender. Has come from abroad. Hey, do not hide inside after taking money from us. Do you think we will spare you? Come out. Otherwise... What are you seeing? Girl? Have you never been in love? Shame on you. Come out. Otherwise I will come inside. What is the matter? Nothing. Bring betel leaves and nuts. We will sit and talk here. - Okay sir. Get up. Where is the interest money? I gave you last week. You gave last week. Will your grandfather give this week? I have no money to buy rice. My husband has gone to town to earn some money. He has still not come back. So sad. I will pay next week with dues. No problem. She says she will give next week. Let us go. What Let's go. Look at her. No tears in her eyes. She is shedding crocodile tears. Buddy, behave yourself. You should not speak cheaply with women. If we speak softly, they will dominate us. Okay. If you do not give the interest money, I will take anything that I lay my hands on. Did you think I will take you? Yes. Am I a fool to take you? I will take your household items. Stay back. Back. How much should you pay? Three hundred rupees. What nonsense is this? Are you harassing her for just three hundred rupees? It is not at all good, I say. Very good. You got the money. Next house. Will you give the money in the next house or shall I ask them? It depends. His sister is an insect that sucks the blood of the poor. But he is very kind and is considerate. Buddy, love is more important than money in life. Sister, what are you thinking? I have a good idea. When will you return? Tell me. You know to borrow but do not return back. Did he see me? Is it? Come on. Now? He did not turn this side. Then he is not a scooter that will start with a kick. I have to push him. Come. - Okay. Let us go. Will punch your face. Hey! What? What? What shall I talk? Bulbul, will you not speak to me? Boys say that. Hey Bullabulla! Will you not speak? Bullabulla? Buddy, when did you become Bullabulla? Keep quiet. Chinminiki, if you had got married at the right age, you would have got two daughters now. Instead you are trying to woo any person who you meet. Are you calling me Bullabulla? To hell with it. What do you think of my sister? - Your sister... Do you think she is like your sister? You say she is aged. But even now if she touches her nose ring, hundreds of men will stand in queue to talk to her. Where is the queue? My sister has not shown any interest. That's all. Hey! I will not look at the local boys. The boy I am going to marry must come by plane. In which mode should he come? - Should have come by plane. He has come. He must not be fat. He must be slim and fit. Yes. His complexion must not be white. Should he be of red color? I like black color. Precious black! My husband should not be only a man. He must occupy my father's place. Yes, he will be. Then... - Are you trying to woo my boss? What?! Were you talking about me till now? Could you not make out what she was saying? No. - You are so innocent. Miss... Yes. You are so beautiful. Do you love me? Yes. Boss, do you also agree? - Yes. Love at first sight. My grandmother used to say that if a banana is given to a hungry fellow he will eat it with skin. Today I have realized. Shut up. Go. If sister knows she is the girl he loves, she will kill. "Will wait till I get you..." "Till you smile at me..." "Come till my house" "Till the end..." "I will be there with you." "I was quiet till yesterday..." "I lost myself after seeing you" "It is the love since births" "We have fallen in love..." "This bondage is so good..." We have to go home. - Wait. Hi! - Hi! Your smile is so beautiful. Shall I ask you one thing? Have you never taken loan from my sister? No... not at all. But I feel I have given loan to you in my previous birth. Is it? That is why the interest for you increases day by day. "Fall in love..." "Like in previous births." "It is a new love..." "Stay with me..." "During light and darkness..." "My heart sings for it." "Stay and speak with me" "Forever. I was quiet till yesterday..." "I lost myself after seeing you" "It is the love since births" "We have fallen in love..." "This bondage is so good..." "Forever." "I was quiet till yesterday..." "I lost myself after seeing you" "It is the love since births" "We have fallen in love..." "This bondage is so good..." What is your age? - Why? He is trapped. Say. - Shut up! Do not be scared. In which year were you born? Why do you want to know? - Say now. Nothing. I wanted to know whether simplicity was born first or you were born first. So sweet. I cannot bear till I know when this uncle was born. If someone tells, I will be happy. Sir! Sage, please forgive me. Everyone like the drug. Sir, people will kill us if we do not take the drug. Come. Come. He has brought us to a place where humans are sacrificed. Sir. Come here. Money... Money... Has it stopped? If you supply drugs to us continuously we will give you money equal to your weight. This money-shower will never stop then. Is it? - Yes. Sir, why are you giving so less drugs? Why? I want a truck load of drugs. Customers are addicted to your drugs and want more. This will not be sufficient. Hey, do you know how special it is? We have to work hard to make a small quantity. We have used hundreds of bonded laborers day and night to prepare this quantity. Employ thousands of laborers. People will not know. Nobody will find out whatever is happening in this under world. Bring any amount of people and keep them as slaves here. There is a lot of demand for your product. Next time, do not give a small quantity. We will need more quantity. See you. Come. Sir, I will go now. Mind wavers. Do not go to the outside world of humans because of your greed for money. Do not enter into the Aravalli village. Hi! Perfume is good. I told you. Bro, stop ogling at her. Concentrate on the worship being done here. - What... What is this ritual? Any festival? - That... Tomorrow... - What can I say? There is a custom in this village to pray to moon on lunar eclipse day. They believe that it will safeguard the village from any harm. Oh! You mean lunar eclipse? - What did you say? Lunar eclipse. Can I come there? - Look there. Bring it here. Before the camphor stops burning the buffalo must be cut into two in one stroke. Anji! What are you doing? Get up. The lifted sword should not be put down. Do not hit him. Get up soon. Let it be. What did the innocent animal do? Anji, you will not understand it. This is our custom. You should not question it. Why shouldn't I question? You have fed and brought up this animal. You feel pity when I die. Don't you feel anything if it dies? Why? Is it because I am your brother? Is this humanity? No God asks for blood as offering. This custom has been made for your convenience. Okay. If you really want to sacrifice something why are you sacrificing this dumb animal? It will nod its head when you sprinkle water on it. Sprinkle water on me also. I will also nod. Sacrifice must happen before the eclipse is complete. Camphor is waning. Anji, do not take such things lightly. You want to sacrifice someone. Then kill me. Complete your ritual with my blood. O Mother God! Anji! Why did you do this? We cannot create a small being. What right do we have to take a life? God gives life. We do not have right to take it. As humans, it is our dharma to protect it. It is not that... Guru is here! Guru, will anything bad happen because we did not sacrifice? Nobody has control over the events. The discontinued chapter will begin again. Hey, this is Alamellamma's shop. You will get things only if you have money. Hey woman, how dare you beat me? You can enjoy only for a few more days. After that you and Alamellamma must bow to my sister. Get lost. Do you know the brilliant idea that my sister has made to trap your Alamelamma? Sister, Anji's sister is coming for ask for a girl's hand to him. What?! He likes me a lot. How did he agree to marry a girl of his sister's choice? This stupid fellow told everything when he was drunk yesterday. You...! Sit. Hey! How dare you perform your brother's marriage to someone else when I am here? Does he want to marry another girl? Are you taking revenge because I shouted at you? You threaten that you will cut my limbs. Do whatever you want. I love him wholeheartedly. Are you scared of your sister? If anyone comes between us, I will cut off their head. Come with me. I will take care of you till death. I will take care of you like a child. It is true that I wanted to deceive you. But I have no hatred towards you. Your sister is swindling other people's money. That is why I planned to use you and control your sister. But while trying to dupe you, I lost myself. Not only me. No one on this earth can cheat your brother. If they talk with him once they will fall for his innocent nature. A girl must do penance to God to get such a good person as husband. Hey! I have spoken a lot. Why are you sitting as if you do not care about it? Nothing is left. Everything is over between us. Hey! No, she is lying. You keep quiet. Why are still sitting after hear this? Get up. Old lady? You sinner, are you marrying this old man because you could not marry me? What has happened to you? Shut up and sit down. Young people are immature. You do not mistake. She is our girl. She is going to marry my brother. She behaves like this during new moon day and full moon days. We are not seeing any girl for him here. They both have come to ask for money for their daughter's marriage. Please take. Don't want. This is for an auspicious occasion. Do not pledge your house. Return only the principal whenever you can. He is unique. He is a rare jewel. If he has liked you you must be really of good nature. If you take my place, good things will happen. Hail Alamelamma! Hail Alamelamma! I made a mistake by not entering this village all these days. I have grown up in forest and have a strong body. Now I have found a matching one. What is happening here? You are very beautiful! Though married, you still look young. Though aged, you are still good looking. The fruit bitten by parrot is very tasty! Come. Come. Come. "I want to see him alive..." "Come to my life..." "Into the sky..." "So... I want to see him alive..." I will touch your body. I will touch and eat you up. Araka! What are you doing? What have you done? Didn't I tell you not to act smart and enter the village? Get out of here. Go. Forgive me. Forgive me. Mother, forgive me. Hey! How dare you fight with me? Anji! He is going to die. Feed him to the vultures. Throw him. Why have I not got married still? Now I realized why I am not yet married. A man must protect women. He kidnapped my sister and the girl I love. But I was helpless. I am a coward. I am a weakling without any power. Men like me should not be alive. Should not be alive. Sage, what happened to Anji? What happened? Tell us. Have you stopped coughing? Coughing... Yes... I am not coughing now. I have recovered. Keep quiet. Sage, what happened to Anji? Tell us. Is he dead? You may be a strong or a weak person. But you are a great man who lived as per your conscience. You will be preserved. Your death will be used for the destruction of the wicked. There is a noble reason for the death of your body. Noble reason? What is it? Sage, tell us. What is the reason? Many years ago... "Powerful weapon." He has to die. He has sacrificed his life. Why are you still worried? No. There is one more person who is a threat to my life. "Bhuvana size flame ophthalmic, The letter of Ghana..." "He is a warrior..." "He is a fighter..." "If you come, near him," "The sky torn by him" "Sing in praise of Bajrangi..." "Sing in praise of Bajrangi..." "He fights..." "He pushes..." "He kills..." "He is a real monkey..." "Move fearlessly. You are brave.!" "Take a walk. The terrible that moved." "Don't go ahead of me! Don't bother me." "That diamond fist is ego," "He won't tolerated." "Sing in praise of Bajrangi..." "Sing in praise of Bajrangi..." "Bajrangi..." "Bajrangi..." "Bajrangi..." "Bajrangi..." Leave us, please... Get well soon. Okay? We will meet tomorrow. Doctor, they have been shot at. Why are you going without treating him? If I treat them, it is a shame on my doctor profession. As a doctor, you are not saying the right thing. Excuse me. You will realize it one day. Sir, come fast. Look there. Come. The bullet has fallen from their body. They have done self treatment. Sir, they have made medicines from this plant. Good morning officer. I think those were shot are now fine. Will you not give me my fees? How is it possible, doctor? You are new to this forest. You do not know about them. Who are they? Do you know them or the skill of these forest dwellers? Look at the tattoo of conch on the body of men. Look at the nectar vessel tattoo on the forehead of women. Ayurveda's first God. The God of medicines... They belong to the family of Dhanvantri. Their observation is so good that they have the ability to find out the disease within a human body. To say in short... Their observation is like X ray machine. Many rulers have acquired the knowledge of Ayurveda from them. But it is a tragedy that God gave them knowledge. But has snatched sanity. The wicked forest king who rules them now is... Hey! Jai Maakali! - Jai Maakaali! Jai Maakaali! He uses their phenomenal knowledge of Ayurveda for wrong deeds. He makes drugs and spoils the health of people. Now he is selling those drugs to foreign countries. He has killed all those who tried to stop this heinous crime. Till today no one from the outside world, know about his misdeeds. If their generation comes to an end, we will have to pay a big price for it. Our people are getting addicted to medicines. Because it is not a life savior. It is a drug. This must not happen. Their Ayurveda knowledge must not get eradicated. It must be preserved for future generations. Otherwise the money that man spends now for building house and other needs will be spent on his health. Remember this. In future, health will become a business. Hospitals will become a revenue collecting industry in our country. Leave us! Leave us! Leave us! Leave us! Get up. Get up. Do not eat. Sudheedhandra, when you pray to God, will you pray to our God also? My life was saved by him. How can I forget him? Sir, just a minute. That boy drank fire. Right? Even I wanted to ask the same thing. Why is he with them? Why is he calling that man as 'God'? Some years back... A river in the west of Kannada land was flowing to the brim. At that time a woman on boat went into labor. If she was not taken to the other side the life of both mother and child will be in danger. At that time Bajrangi came as their savior. He believed that God creates man and it is my duty to protect. He staked his life. He took her safely to the other bank. She delivered a male child. As he saved their life both mother and child considered him their God and served him. They adored him. Give me offering. It is 'God's offering' for us. We must offer to you. Both of you will not change. Where have you taken our children? I will hit back. You wicked people... Show me my child. If you exploit children, you will be in trouble. Wicked people. You will be ruined. Where is he? Where is my child? Where is he? Repeat what I say. Aa... Aa means... (M) - Aa means... Mother. - Mother. Mother! God, eat fruit. God, did you eat this? Will you eat this, God? Please eat this. I don't want. What else do you want? Will you give me anything that I want? We were uncivilized. You have refined our nature. You have given knowledge and education to our children. You have improved our living. - Come and see this. She had some problem during delivery. The mother is not able to hear her child call her. Can you treat her and make her like before? We do not know what you are asking for. Please forgive us if you are unhappy about us. I was doing worship to lord Anjaneya every new moon day. At that time... "Pray to God Narayana..." "Pray to God Narayana..." "Pray to God Narayana..." "Pray to God Narayana..." "Pray to God Narayana..." "Pray to God Narayana..." "Pray to God Narayana..." "Pray to God Narayana..." "O Lord Vasudeva" "O Lord Dhanavantri" "With the nectar..." "Destroy the poison..." "O Lord" "Save him..." You have eaten some poisonous plant. Tell me where it is. It must not be there where humans live. Is this the one? God, did you eat it purposely? Yes. Why? To know if you have the power to treat it. We do not know anything. When you vomited blood, we realized there is poison in your body. Your life would have been in danger if it remained. So we took it out. That's all. - Why did you try to take it out? You must have left it as it is. We cannot bear to see you in pain. You belong to us. You are our God. What did you say? - God, you are one of us. Didn't you get the same feeling when you saw that unconscious mother? Didn't you feel that her pain is more? We must live and let others live. That is the dharma of all creations. Let our heart be magnanimous like the sky. Let humanity be like ocean. You know Ayurveda. You belong to the family of Dhanvantri. Do not hide the nectar vessel that you hold in your hand, with your fist. You have the knowledge to save millions of people. Do not discriminate. Did you want to sacrifice your life for that? If things had turned bad... Only my life would have been lost. But if they decide they can save millions of people. "Lord Govinda! Lord Govinda!" "Lord Govinda! Lord Govinda!" "Lord Govinda! Lord Govinda!" "Life is precious" "Life is precious" "Life is precious" Mother! Mother! "O mother!" "O mother!" "O mother!" "O mother! O mother!" The mother and child saluted us with folded hands. Then we felt that Bajrangi was right. Till now we have captured and bound people like you and sacrificed them. But today you have come to the demon's den voluntarily. Demon? But I see them as Gods and angels. Are these human demons who eat human flesh, the celestial beings? Yes. They are Gods and angels. You are the demon. They belong to the Dhanvantri family and were born to save people. But you made them your slaves and are using them to kill people. They have been our slaves since generations. You cannot reform them. I have not come to reform anyone. I have come to remind them of their duties. I have come to reveal their power. They have to follow my orders. That is their power. Their duty is to be my slaves. They are like crows that eat the leftovers of my food. Crows?! Isn't there any value for their life? Though your family had immense knowledge of Ayurveda they lived here as non- entities. Even you all are living the same way here. Do you want your future generation also to live here? In this world millions of people are suffering and dying of diseases. Come. Save them. That is your dharma. You believed him all these years. For once believe me and come with me. Even if I die, I will protect you. Okay sir. We served him all these years. But he called us 'crows' and 'demons'. But this man looks upon us not as humans but as God. Let us believe him. We will believe him. We believe in him. Hey! You are like insects under my feet. Now you believe him and are acting against me. Hey outsider! Are you under an illusion that all of them will follow you because one person is with you? No. No. None of them will follow you. Hey old woman! Stop it, boss. All these years we were eating leftovers, like the crows. We do not know whether we will be Gods in our old age. At least we want to live as humans. I do not care if others come or not. I will come with you. Let us go. Come. Even I will come. I will also come. I will also come. I will also come. We will also come. We will also come. If I am alive, these people belong to me. If you are alive, these people belong to you. Life is created by God. No one has the right to take it. If I had wanted to kill you I would have cut off your head as soon as I came. But bloodshed is not my way. I have never desired to be a king or wanted power. You be the king. You take care of them. But take care of them in a proper way. Wild animals and plants are a treasure of forest. But you use them in a wrong way and destroy them. You will get only that you give. Remember it. You have shown pity on a wicked person and forgiven him. Nobody will be so magnanimous. You are a real God. You are God. Hail Bajrangi! - Hail Bajrangi! Hail Bajrangi! Hail Bajrangi! Hail Bajrangi! Hail Bajrangi! Wait. Let us go. "He handles the problem of this earth" "He is like a boat in water..." "He is spread everywhere like the stars in galaxy..." "He defeated the enemy..." "He handles the problems of this earth" "He is like a boat in water..." "He is scattered in the galaxy..." "He defeated the enemy..." "He is the knight..." "He is the knight" "He is born to script history..." "He is Bajrangi..." "He is Bajrangi..." "It was these people who gave the nectar" "They possess knowledge to treat diseases..." "He was like a relative..." "People did not fear if he was there..." "People believed him like God" "Such a life is indeed great..." "He is a great son!" "He is Bajrangi..." "He is Bajrangi..." You have saved my daughter and given her a new life. He lives in a forest. He doesn't expect money, fame or recognition in return. And sends these medicines to us. He is a noble man who considers this world as his family. You must be grateful to him. May he live for hundred years! May he lead a healthy life! "He handles the problems of this earth" "He is like a boat in water..." 'They were doing a great service of saving many lives.' 'So the doctors wanted to give them something in return.' 'Doctors started giving them eatables and gifts...' 'The doctors gave more and more gifts.' 'And their desires increased.' 'They started forgetting their duty as they received more gifts.' 'Their desire turned to expectation...' 'Expectation turned to greed.' What have you brought for us to eat? Sweets... Savory? Have you not brought anything? We did not know what to bring. So... Alright. Let us go. Sister! Do you like it? - Yes. Give it to me. - Give me. 'They became greedy.' 'Their love and affection towards each other was lost.' 'They fought amongst themselves.' 'They lost their unity.' 'Bajrangi started worrying after seeing the change in their behavior.' Grandma, this great medicine of Ayurveda should be available to future generations. Please write it down. We are illiterate. Sudheedhandra! - Yes, my God. You write is down. Me? It is dangerous if the wicked acquire knowledge. But it is a treasure if it is with a noble man. Write it down in an excellent manner. It must be permanent. As you say, my lord. "Salutations to Lord Vishnu..." "Let us pray to his form of Dhanvantri..." "Pray to the supreme power..." "Pray to the creator of life..." "Pray to Lord Narayana..." "Pray to Lord Narayana..." "Pray to Lord Narayana..." "Pray to Lord Narayana..." "Salutations to Lord Vishnu..." "Let us pray to his form of Dhanvantri..." Sudheedhandra! - Yes, grandma. What are you doing during this night time? Grandma, you belong to the clan of Dhanvantri who was born with the vessel of nectar. God has given you the knowledge of Ayurveda as a boon. But I am not so virtuous. I am just trying to acquire a little knowledge of what you have. You all call us God. If it is really true I pray to God that let him give you the power that we have. Grandma... "We pray to you, lord Krishna" "We pray to you, lord Krishna" "We pray to you, lord Krishna" "We pray to you, lord Krishna" "Salutations to Lord Vishnu..." "Let us pray to his form of Dhanvantri..." [Sanskrit chants] I am troubling you because I want to cure diseases in humans. Forgive me. Sudheedhandra! Yes guru. You have achieved your desire to interact with nature. If divine power also supports your mental strength you will get supreme knowledge of God and achieve more. Your brilliance will shine more. Come with me. Guru! - Come. "Lord Narayana! Lord Narayana!" "Lord Narayana! Lord Narayana!" "Lord Narayana! Lord Narayana!" "Lord Narayana! Lord Narayana!" "Lord Narayana! Lord Narayana!" "Lord Narayana! Lord Narayana!" "Lord Narayana! Lord Narayana!" Have you brought money?! Come and take. Give more. What are you doing? Why? Why are you giving this? They asked for it. It is our fees. You keep quiet. We were like a savage. That noble man has reformed us. Do not fall for money and become greedy. Lord will feel bad. Why should we not take money for his sake? Hey! Why should he control us? Should we beg for food from others till we die? Are we also not doctors? It is not enough if he uses our sweat and reputation and acts like a king. He must also involve in our hardship. Take it. Let us go. They have become greedy. There is a cure for all diseases. But I never expected this disease. 'Bajrangi decided to punish their arrogance.' 'He cut off their contact with the doctors.' 'But these fools prepared medicines and were waiting for the doctors.' 'But the doctors did not come.' 'Ayurvedis medicines must be used' 'within a prescribed time of preparing it.' 'Otherwise it will lose its medicinal property.' 'Cannot be put to use.' Forgive us, God. We made a mistake. Do not believe him. Do not believe. They are lying. They have a wavering mind. No grandma, we have really changed. We do not want money. We will do as you say. I believe you. It is common to all. You have realized your mistake. That is enough for me. God, everyone change their face. But they change their word. No grandma. If we do not believe them after this, we will become inferior. Let us not scratch a wound. I believe... them. Sir. - Yes. Call all doctors tomorrow. Why? We have never seen the things given by them earlier. We became greedy because they gave us. We will plead with them tomorrow not to give us any gifts. We will tell them to take the medicines prepared by us. And ask them to forgive us if we had hurt their feelings. Alright. All of you eat contently. Serve some more curry to him. God, you also eat with them. No. First guests should eat. Then we should eat. Doctor! - Want some more. Hey! Hey! Come here. Alas! You have mixed poison in food. You have shown your true color. Why did you do this? What harm did they do to you? Araka! Jagrava's son. My father Jagrava was a strong man who killed 10 elephants with his hand. He was a powerful man who instilled fear in the minds of enemies like you. Such a strong man could not withstand this man's blow. He suffered agony in the hands of this man. My father shivered when this man fought with him. My father fell on the ground after being beaten by him. This man showed mercy on my father's life and did not kill him. Have you come to take revenge against him for that? Revenge... It will be a crematorium. What more do you want? After hearing about him, I have come to see his valor. What do you mean? That is the nectar of life. It has been prepared by those people who mixed the poison. Fight with my men and show your courage. Fulfill my wish and take it. Is this the time for such pranks? Do not play with lives. Hey! Give it. Keep quiet. Humans must protect lives. Not kill. No! Come and take. Bajrangi! Blood... Blood. Red blood. Are you surprised how you were poisoned? I will distribute to all. Give. Madam, I am happy about your service. How to save them? Say. What a great scene! Hanumantha, the great savior brought the Sanjeevini to bring back Lakshmana's life. He was healthy and powerful at that time. But this man is fighting for his life. Still he is taking the nectar to others. May your glory spread in all directions! Bajrangi! If I were you, I would have eaten that nectar first. Hey fool! It is not nectar. It is also poison. Sudheendra! The world calls you a kind man who saves lives. But today you have taken lives with your hands. I am Araka. I am a wicked man who takes revenge. I brought them under my net and used them at the right time. I am a demon who can kill a roaring lion. You will be burnt to ashes if you are attacked by my revengeful act. Well done. Well done. I have got whatever I wanted. Now I want to know who that person was. Who mixed poison? Well done. I have to reward you for your treachery. It is cheating. Cheating. What is betrayal? Which is betrayal? You were with my father all these years. But later you took his side. Is it not betrayal? You were calling him God but gave him poison in the end. Is it not betrayal? You are like worms that cannot withstand anything. Kill them. You always wanted to protect them. Your idea must remain immortal. Defeat the demon and save them. "Bajrangi!" Your idea must not die. God, your idea must not die. Get up. Get up. Get up. "Bajrangi!" Get up. "Powerful weapon." "Bajrangi!" "Bajrangi!" "Bajrangi!" "Bajrangi!" Demons, you invited them and then killed them. What is left for us now? Are we the wicked people who went against a noble person who helped us? Our act will be a curse on us. The blood that we shed here will be a lesson for the humankind in the next generation. Our people should not live. This will be our last generation. Grandma! Hey kind man! This is just a beginning. I will take the lives of many more people. "It is a funeral pyre... It is a crematorium..." Sudheendra! We are sinners. I gave poison to our God. I should not be alive. I am seeing God. I am seeing my God. He is my God. Bring him back to life. He is my God. Bring him back to life. What nonsense are you talking? Creation, status and rhythm are beyond our control. It is impossible for us to change it. Take my life. Take my son's life. But save that God. Save our God. It is not possible for me to make a soul enter this dead body and bring it back to life. Only he can do it. Who is he? Who is he, guru? The all powerful supreme God. Only the Omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent God can do it. Nobody else can do it. You save our God. I will call the mighty God. I will call the omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent God. "I will pray to the supreme God." May you be victorious, Sudheendra! May you be victorious, Sudheendra! Does it mean that both the souls of Anji and Bajrangi were with you? Yes. [Sanskrit chants] [Sanskrit chants] "Pray to Lord Narayana..." "Pray to Lord Narayana..." [Sanskrit chants] [Sanskrit chants] "Bajrangi!" Bajrangi! Bajrangi?! Araka! Blood. Blood. Red blood. Are you wondering how it came? Like you, I did not poison you by cheating. I hit you with my hand. I attacked your outrage. I cut down your anger that was burning like a volcano. You are a betrayer. You are an opportunist who brought others in your net and used them to your advantage. You are a killer, a murderer, a demon. Araka!, Now you have fallen down like a helpless man. I am Bajrangi. I am a messenger of Lord Rama if you pray to me with devotion. Though I have the power or a ocean, I will surrender to love. I am the strong person who burnt Ravana's land Lanka because he crossed his limit. Son of Anjana. Brave monkey. The brave Hanumantha. If I hit you with my fist, the mighty Araka will die. Araka! Araka, get up. Come. Come. "Go, Bajrangi" "You are a brave man... Kill the wicked demon..." "Go, Bajrangi..." [Sanskrit shlok] [Sanskrit shlok] "Hail Bajrangi!" "Hail Bajrangi!" My life will be to serve you. It is not possible for humans to be immortal. Then will my penance of all these years not bear fruit? An individual is not permanent. But individuality is permanent. Life is not permanent. But thought is permanent. I or You will not live forever. Thoughts must live. Not the individual. Our future generations will suffer from many diseases. Many people will be affected. For their cure, I have given you the responsibility of writing Ayurveda the medical knowledge of Dhanvantri clan. But you spent your entire life for my sake because of your devotion to me. It is true that because of your prayers and divine power the demon Araka was destroyed. My responsibility is over. You know the future course of action. Let our thoughts be taken forward. Bid me farewell, Sudheendra. "Bajrangi..." It is my last wish to my God. The supreme God was in your body. Mighty Bajrangi is in your body. Sudheendra has donated his knowledge to you. Anji, now you are not an ordinary man. What happened to Anji? Where is he? Sage!
