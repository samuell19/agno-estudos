I want to help people meet, but the language prevents it. The language is the constructed light, and that is what my book is about. I think we need a big damn power outage a year- -to get an eye on each other. People do not understand how dark it really is. I have written a poem collection. There you go. Read it with devotion. I really have to work. I called, but you were in the shower. And then did you go in? It is over. It's over, Anna. You can pack your stuff. Keys, credit cards. How does it feel like being a errand-boy? Can I ask a personal matter? Don't you have any friend that you sleep? Means "inadequately social network" that I have too few friends? I understand that this is not easy. You have come a long way in the process. Many people who are lonelier Than me still have children. I can not hear what you're saying. Say it again. So I can not adopt? Look out! Shit! How did it go? -Damn. - hello? "Thank you" is it right? You're drinking coffee, Thomas? Why wouldn't I do that? I thought you were the tea type. Do not worry now. I'm not doing it. We must have Lundstedt With the property fee. It is already done. It is in your email. You make you really indispensable. DOUGLAS READING CHINESE -D-D-Douglas. -Hey, that's Anna Willman. -Hi Anna. -It was a long time ago. Can we meet? -H-h-how fun! -I'm free today. Yes, s-s-shit, how fun! Hey! The invoice from Nordel was okay. -Excellent job mare. -I do not like you swearing. It sounds relaxed, I do not like it. And it's called "workmire". Did you write a letter to anyone? I took a name in the phone directory. -What did you write then? -If I was dumb or in love. -It's quite sick. -So you just wrote to someone? -I was thirteen, it was exciting. -It's actually totally sick, Minou. Do you contact them again? -No. You just wrote a lot of junk and dumped it into a stranger's knee. They probably did not get that bad. Can you know the opposite? Of course, I can not know that, But I did not write those letters. Darkness seems to be the new black one. I hate the darkness and calm! I love light and stress. I love town, electricity. I want to go up in the middle of the night, Press a button and turn on the light. That's why I hate Northern-Sweden. The terrible darkness. I stayed there for four months. Norwegians are like mosquitoes.. The mosquitoes stick and suck while The women suck and late stick. Use power, turn on the lights. This with stand-by ... Turn them on! Light, throw, wrap - I think so. I can get Klara tomorrow. No, I do not work. -When do you want me to come? -Half past four, four. TELEPHONE SIGNAL -Thomas Larsson at Minister Melling. -It's Anna. You can not call here! -Hello? -Douglas! Douglas! We'll leave in five minutes. You have not forgotten? N-n-no. Sorry, I got a bit busy. Is that so? I-I-I never promised to come along. I said it would be fun. I met an old friend. "Friend" isn't it? Who are you going to meet? -Anna Willman from GÃ¤rdesskolan. -I know who she is. We have not seen each other in five years. I-I-it only takes a while. -Now you're becoming unclear. -I'll come with you sometime. You should start playing tennis again, Douglas. You look a bit wary. Phone signal Lindstedts publisher, that's Karin. She is at a meeting and will return at two o'clock. Thanks. Phone signal Lindstedts publisher, that's Karin. Hi, Claes. No sorry. He is busy. -With Danish accent: Hi, Johan. -Hello! Did you hurt yourself? -Battles on KB. No, I trampled on Gotland. Have you read this? Please wait. -Yes, damn good. -The next one gets even better. -Have you read my script? -Yes what a damn story! -It is joyful? -Yes it's true. Do you think so? Are there any traces we can continue on? What do you think... Johan, start by deciding for a main character and a playground. I have done that. -The main character is the playground. - Explain, I do not understand. -It's Stockholm. -Stockholm? I see the language like light, like electricity. But that can prevent us from seeing reality as it really is. In case of power failure, we see the world as it is and ourselves- and realize that we are only shadows for each other. What did you think about the power outage? like metaphor? Karin! Call and say I'm on my way. -I will send a new version. -Johan. I asked you to come to Joakim East to write a biography about your dad. Therefore, Joakim has asked me to ask you if you would like to meet him. -Why? -We have contacted your sister as wel. She is not interested, and we respect that. Can I get any compensation? If you persuade your sister to attend it may be easier to arrange. But it has already been written three books about dad. Your dad was a great writer. Karin! Do you have an invitation to Johan? Yes, I'll fix that! Come on to our little publishing party tonight It's masked. That makes me happy. Oh how fun! It was nice to meet you, Johan, but I have to keep working. With played Danish accent: See you on the masquerade! What are you saying? "Masked" Yes, we look like "masked"! It's "beautiful". Bye! -Hello. -How, how fun. -What are you doing nowadays? -I-I-I develop games. Now I will go to China and work. What are you doing? -Nothing. I have nowhere to live. -Shit! I can get a contract. How much does it cost? I know it's completely sick, but I have no one else to ask. But your b-b brother, then? No, maybe not. Sorry, that was ... forget about it. Anna. What happened? -Hello. -Hello. You are Coletho? I just met Gustav on the publisher. We talked about you. -Yeah? -Your book "Spark" is damn powerful. -Thanks. -I'm also writing. Fine. Thank you, how nice. I asked you to solve this. You will get a new number for me. Hello? Is there anybody left? SGZ... DOUGLAS SPEAKING CHINESE Hello? The board work was a summer break compared to being available. I've always been a little strange. The only Swedes do is to soap, shame and kiss herring. No I do not think so. The days just rush past. No, no. Yes, we say so. And then unlock. Drag like this. The arrow. What did I do now, then? No, wrong. I have bought a new rifle for dad. Can you arrange so that he gets it on reception? Have you forgotten Dad is 60 years old? What? No. Sorry. You do not need to talk.. No. You may want to choose the wine? That would make it easier for me. And notify the catering. Gustav! Johan! Have you talked to your sister? Tomorrow. Thank you for the "masked"! -What are you saying? -Tack for "masked"! See you. A surreal vampire... -Hello. Johan. -Yes exactly. Hello to you. You got my poem ... I gave you my poetry collection. -So? - "The sun is shining". -Oops. "I'm looking for the ugly language. My poems are like the crazy guy which last remained at the party. Who remember the following day? The guy that was thrown out. The afathic darkness that liberates ... It's pretty fun that the poem should be like the hardest guy at the party. Thank you, it should not be fun. The man with the african darkness. You! Your dad was good. Thanks. I was wondering if you'd like to read a script. I can send it. What did you say you should send? Oh sorry. So, now it's clear. You can send just what fan you want to me. Can you turn off the engine? There is a letter with my name and my address in that car. Yes? It is idle driving max one minute. Damn! Hey. It felt safer to hand over it personally. -You have a publisher? -Yes, Gustav Nygaard. Gustav. -Nygaard? -Gustav. Is he right for you? -What then? That he is business oriented suits me, but... -What then? -He is not so afathic. Here it is, at least - "Blind of darkness". I was going to check out ... When did you think to read it? Today or tomorrow. Or it will be when the fan becomes. This means terribly much for me. Your opinion means something like that Well. - Uncertain, can I get an autograph? -Sure. -Hello! Are you okay? -Yes. -Hey. "I'm a fighter to Klara. They are working. -Will work? -Klaras mom and dad What a shame, you can win the delicatess. I have been eating for several weeks for it this day. I have slept in a sleeping bag. -What does it say? -It's 99. Wait, it's 66. It's a point. But turning the patch turns 99. It is called digit space space. Then it's time for lottery! -Nummer 66. -We are! We won. -We did that too. -We were like water. Then we'll look at the lots. You see. - You must have seen errors. -We did not? -No, I've seen it wrong. -We had the winning lottery. There is a point. Can I see? You have to accept that we won. You did not. We won, we had number 66. It's hard with "your" and "mine" but let go of our basket. -We did not? -Yes, we won, Klara. Do you remember the point after sex? If you want to take the basket away from her -Goodbye. Not? Well then. No. Hi, it's Thomas Larsson at the Ministry of Finance. One of your employees has parked at one of our parking lots. It's easily happened, but I want to get in touch with the driver- -to the vehicle with registration number SGZ 155. Yes. Erik Dahlbergs... Hi, Jessica Simonsson. You have written a letter to me. Why did you do that? I do not know who you are. Do you know who I am? I would like to meet you. If you come to the Gondola on Friday at 19.15, I invite dinner. I have a red handkerchief in my chest pocket. Best regards, Thomas Larsson.. Looks met look, smiles raised smiles- -and the darkness appeared contours of hope. Hey, how good! Now he talks to himself again. Why does he just go around all the time? -He's crazy. And then you should have the property ... It is the clean frame of the Hallon Mountains. Now he looks at us again, Erik. Goodbye, what's the matter? I t-t believe you imagine, mother. I'm getting nervous. He never sleeps. Sometimes he can stand by the window and staring. What's in his head? It's unpleasant. Sure fan is uncomfortable. - He scares Mom. You're welcome. J-j-I'm going to Shanghai. I have created a game. I sent it to a production company. What the hell are you saying? What about fucking games? -An online game. -I struggled to give you a seat. And now you're going to throw away everything. G-g-games... The gaming market is a huge market, dad. Do you have to go to Beijing? -Shanghai. -It's not important. -Do not fight. -I will come home again. -After graduation you will do whatever the fuck you want. Hi, Coletho. It is Johan Willman. I wonder if you have read the script It would have been fun to hear what you think, so hear from you.. Damn! What the hell is happening? What have I done? Go ahead. - You have to calm down I am calm. I'm broke, homeless, dumped and damn calm. I understand if you feel insane sat. Tomorrow evening in the apartment. Hi, AndrÃ©. This is Jessica Simonsson. I have a new project. I need comedian Fredrik Berg's phone number. Now we solve the delicate basket issue. Delicacy Bin? If anything has to be solved Do you have to do that with your therapist? BANG -Only, I did not hear the last one. You are ashamed of yourself. Yes? I do not think so. I do not like it at all. In addition, it was ugly of you to ask me to take the basket in front of the children. -You know what? -We won! I suggest you compensate me and Klara with a new delicatessen basket. Hello? Hello? What then? He put on. You'll get them back. But you're s-s-still playing? That's the piano. No, that was Dad's thing. -You can always, t-t-teach. -You are still alive quite a bit. -Em sorry, I did not want to be busy. -No it is fine. V-v- Do you want to hear a sick thing? When I speak Chinese I do not live at all. It is as if it were a completely different part of the skull. DOUGLAS TALKING CHINESE WITHOUT STUDY Damn what bothered. That's where China is so damn cool. -I do not know right now. Daddy does not want to, so maybe it will not get any.. But crazy in daddy. Promise me you'll make him. I promise. NÃ¤sta: Haymarket. Dad and I are very alike as a writer, and very different. I have always seen myself as a modernist in comparison with him. -Have Gustav told me what I'm writing? -A biography about daddy. Why? There are a lot of reasons. For example, I admire him. Here. I gave it myself on a small one publishers. You probably do not know it again. -Play it with health. -Thanks, how funny. I have a script at Gustav. If you put a good word for me that would mean a lot. I'll help you with this, and you will help me with that. Artistic exchange, one can say. -I have not even read your script. -You can do that. Now I do not understand. What would you like to know about Dad, then? You knew what was going on already from the beginning. What was happening now, then? It does not change, you understand well. I want to know what I did wrong. This is for your sake too, Anna. And then you sent Thomas. That's why I wanted to see and finish correctly. -"Correctly"... -I'm sorry. -If you need help with money ... So now I'm your hora? But oh my God, I'm sorry. I have offered you help and pray sorry. I can not do more. I do not want you to contact me anymore. Hi. W-w-what strange. See you everywhere. It is not clear with the apartment. It's quite calm. Sorry. I feel so damn stupid. Hi, Coletho. It is Johan Willman. I'm sitting on the gondola and taking a beer. Note I am very interested in to hear what you think of my script. Everything good from comrade Johan. They also have liquor if you're craving stuff. I'm sitting here for an hour. The island, the river. -Fredrik. -I'm standing outside your house now. Come on, we can talk. Are you outside my house? -How do you know where I live? -We solve this. -What do you really want? -I just want to... What do you want? Tell me. I want you to compensate me for delicacy basket. Me and Klara won! You have big problems. You are sick, but I can not take responsibility for it. Now I'll call the police. Damn idiot! Looking forward to ... Looks and contours appeared. Appeared. Contours ... -You can live with me. - Daddy, you mean. What do you want? Talk to Joakim East. His book is about dad. The truth is that dad was drunk and dull. We will get money if you participate. What then? -How did it go? -Ouch! -You... -I have met Joakim East. If you were to read the book and wondering later. I will not do that. I do not understand how you can live there. -It goes well. -It's full of dad's old shit. I've cleaned up. It was as if everything was completely quiet and terrible. It turned out to be true. It was as though the earth became dark, quiet and cold, and nothing more. It was so damn liberating. Then I came on the recurring sentence in the book. "It's not safe to see each other, though you see each other. " -I have to work now. - Do you think you've read it? -I'll call you. -Good. When do you call? I'll call when I've read everything! -No strangers. -Okay. And that's what we were talking about. Windscreen wrench, key wrench, basement key. I'm going out first. You can stay and feel for some. Hello? Thomas Larsson. Thomas Larsson. You have written a letter to me. It was in your car. I wrote to you too, but you never answered. You did not come to dinner. It is okay. I have never written a letter. What do you want? I just want to talk. Are you following me? It was you who started. Just acknowledge that you wrote the letter. What the hell. Your fucking snakes. What the hell! Hello Gustav. Thank you for the "masked". It was "beautiful". Are you kidding me? Joakim East Trying to write a book about your dad. A serious work about one of Sweden's greatest writers. And what the hell are you doing? You trample and say your daddy were witches with Hermann Hesse and played poker in Burma. Yes, I exaggerated a little bit. If I have to choose the story and truth, I choose the story. Of course. We'll stay here, Johan. -We will not charge you this. -Here you read my new version? No. -Do you do that? -No. -Okay. Can you ask why? -For reading the first version. But... Actually, it's good, because you're wrong publisher for this literature. Why do you give out dad's books? His only reader Birgitta Trotzig is dead. You are a bad publisher and a good one businessman. Coletho thinks that too. -Coletho? "I quote him verbatimly. You, Johan. I think you'll stop for a while and drop the typewriter a little bit. You know what? Thanks. There is no subscriber this number. Check the number. Hi, Jessica. How good the campaign was. I'm so glad you handled it. As usual cool, awesome, "sweet". -Good that they are satisfied. -Are you kidding? No, I'm not kidding. Hey you... I would like to chat with you about a little sensitive thing. Fredrik Berg called me. -He was very, very upset. -He can not listen! This is a big deal about the agency's reputation. I have contacted with a therapist. The agency pays. Meet her in one month, then you and I talk again. Hi Anna! Fun, how fun. Hey! Hi Anna... INDEPENDENTLY F-f-follow me to China. Do it. What are you going to do otherwise? Are you going to be with her, or? -What do you mean? But what the hell, Anna. I know, I've seen you. -Have you been following me? -I would like to protect you. I did not know how ... I just wanted to help you. I just want to be with you. -I want you to tell us about it. -What do you mean? I want you to tell us about it for your husband. Last morning, Otherwise I go to the press. Why is this getting worse and worse? I can not handle your job. No, why would you do my job? You're getting old, Thomas. NÃ¤men! Go. Go. DOORBELL Hi. Where can I ash? -Here. -What are you doing? -Writing book. No, what are you up to? What gives you the right to bring my talan- -and go up to Gustav and say that I think he is incompetent? I have read your book now, and it sucks so damn hard. Overloaded, pecoristic, posing. It's high-pitched crap without humor. And stop nagging about power failure metaphor. Everyone has taken it. Your dad was a very good author. You are not a very good author. You are a bad author. DOORS OPEN AND CLOSE -- Did you hurt yourself? -If you're kidding, we'll destroy your life.. -Thomas ... -We can ruin your life You are really a vomit. You would do anything if she asked you. -Or if Hitler asked you. -and you are a whore Sit down. Let me clarify a matter. The money that finances your life are not yours, they are mine. The dwelling you are written on is mine. The food you eat is mine all the way down the stomach. -So tell the hell now ... -You beat me else? Why did you spend my money? That was MY money. Damn pig. I-I-I gave them to Anna. Willman? Fill author's daughter? She needed them ... ... t-t-to an apartment. Yes? The t-t-they are gone. She was cheated. T-t-then we do this. You and Anna should never have more contact. You do not go to China. You'll pay back everything- Annan's police report I will report to Anna Willman for theft and fraud. Roger? -How are you actually? -It is good. Why do not you stop Anna, Thomas? -He's crazy. -I need to trust you. -I can not do more. Improvise, take some initiative. We do not work at Samhall. This is the Ministry of Finance. Thomas ... Are you gay? -Or you have other problems? -What then? You have no life out of work, and it worries me. Are you gay? -That is absurd. What's wrong with you then? Stay away from Anna, and you get a chance at work. -Now we work. -I do not understand. People are talking here. Eccentricity goes good, just that does not get uncomfortable. But what have I done? That's not what you do. That's what you are. -Can I help you? -I work with Lena. Is she at home? We wanted to see. Have you seen her here? Well. I'll call her. You can wait here. -What are you doing here? - Did you tell us about us? Are you crazy? Go away. I will call you back. Go now. Please go. -I'm looking for Jessica Simonsson. -Absolutely. -Wait. Where does she live? -Right forward and first to the left. I am busy. Look here. Letter, your note. That's the same handwriting. Look, then. I want you to go now. If you do not go now, I scream. I'm not giving myself. What do you want? Have you talked to your husband? No, it's not about him. I wanted to meet you to ... Please, I can not. I can not! You get the apartment, don't say anything. You get it, take it. Please Anna. Never contact me anymore. Do you understand? -What's your name? -Ella. Thanks so much. -What's your name? -Axel. "Can I write" Axel "? -I just want you to look. Do you know what it says? -Excuse. There are 66 with one point after sixth. Is this true? -Yes. -How nice. Was there anything more? -We can continue. -I was right. -What was your name? Tell me, your damn TV pajamas! Jessica is passionate about delicacies. They are more important to her than climate- threat or peace in the Middle East. When you die, we will bury you a basket of air-dried ham, cheese ... Hey. It is quiet. It's just a thing. Thanks! Yes, I happened to be nearby. Is he okay? -Who? That comedian. -Yes, he is okay. I never watch TV. I just wrote a letter to a name as I found in the directory. -What was in the letter? "Without you, who are you?" Well. For he's a jolly good fellow, and so say all of us -Every fourfold live for Erik. -All: Hurray, hurray, hurray, hurray! -Cheers! -All: Cheers! -Erik! Congratulations. -Thanks. -Welcome. -Thanks. Here is my son Douglas. Hi, Douglas. Lena Melling. -Nice. -Champagne? -Most gladly. -What are you doing? -I-I-I go to Handels. Do you drive? -Of course. Dad never liked you. He just needed you. Here you are. Taxi is here now, Dad. Excuse. What are you doing? I'm throwing my script. Very poetic. You... That's what you can do somewhere else. Hey? Hey! Wait! What fan do you aim for? Idiot. Damn clientele. That way. Imagine, for fuck's sake. Douglas! Douglas? Fucking hell, Douglas. I am stuck! Do not move. Do not move. Raise me the gun. But, fuck! Damn clientele. -You can call for help. -I-I-It's in the car. Do you have the phone in your car when you are out alone in the woods? God damnit! But stick, then! Fast! I'm freezing. Damn idiot -"With you I am Thomas." "Without you, who are you?" Maybe it was a bit unclear. But there were nice flowers. -I was relocated today. -Congratulations. -It was a joke. -Right or white? -Read to meat -When I order. Why can not I order? -I just wanted to be nice. -There you go. -Overall, you order. If that's important to you is it you who will order. -Hello. -Hello. I have a bomb. I want to come in to the room where you turn off the power. -What? -Turn off the power in all Stockholm. I can not turn it off. Who can turn off, then? -The ones down there. Well. -Hi. -Hi. By the way, here. -Beautiful with your dad. -Yes. -I heard you were there. -By whom? Your mom when I called. Do not you want to talk about it? -What are you going to do in Copenhagen? -Go to the music academy -When are you leaving? -Tonight. -Tonight? Now? In a few hours. When do you go to China? In three weeks. -Yeah. -I-I-It's usually not so long. No, or type four hours. Do you have cell horror? Neither do I. Most power outage depends cable break or bad insulators. It's rarely the human factor. Okay. -Are you not feeling well? -So there. It is not dangerous with darkness This is nothing rational. Here, take my hand. Concentrate on how it feels. -Then, what? -Then you put on the power. -You just wanna be late, or? -No, call the police, I guess. Does that feel better? -Yes thank you. I want to tell you about myself. I wanted to adopt but got a refusal.. My social security network was certainly not enough. It made me unbalanced.. I have a big need for self-time. I do not want to clean, which is a problem.. I understand the irony, but I don't think irony is fun. -Do you hear me? -That's too much at once, only. -We can take it in a row. -Yes, it would be preferable. I just want to say one more thing. I'm an awfully loyal person- -and I expect the same by a partner. I'm exactly the same. Five, four, three, two, one. Now you can turn on the power again. Thank you guys, guys. -Shit! -Shit, shit, shit!
