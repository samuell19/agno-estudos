[clicking, smashing] Hey, you. Hey. Hi, Teddy. Hi, guys. Hi. [cheering] [Woman] How was traffic? Well, it wasn't so bad once we got out of the city. Come hold your baby so Kim can have some wine. Hey. Want to go to Daddy? There you go, Lily. [chatter] [Man] I mean, why spend half your time traveling when you can spend 30 minutes in the car? Yeah. We're in the middle of a mountain. Perfect. You can hear the creek and the crickets every night. [Man] Oh, that's so wonderful. You do what you got to do for your family. [rustling] [Woman] Over here. Look. [Man] Hold on. [door knocking] [Man] Hey. Hey. Come on, help us. Please. Let us in. We know you're in there. I can see you moving. They're out here. They're coming. [door knocking] [Woman] We're okay. We're not infected, I swear. Our eyes are good. [door knocking] Open the door. This is the only secure house we've seen in days. They're all over the place. Please, just for tonight. We should let them in. No. [Woman] They're going to kill us. Open up or we're dead. [Man] We're worse than dead, and you know it. You know what will happen to us. Just let her in, please. [Woman] We're not bad people. [whispering] [creature growling] [Woman] Please! Open up! [thumping] Open this fucking door! [Man] I'm getting in there, you hear me? [Woman] Open this fucking door now! [creatures screeches] [Man] Come on! Let us in! They're going to kill us! [woman screaming] [Man] Get away from me! [man screaming] [creatures growling] [woman screaming] [growling and screaming continue] [crunching] Shh, okay, honey, okay. What are you doing? You're asleep. Huh? Just sleep. I got it. Mike. I got it. Can you watch the door? [water running] [Mike] Should we say grace? I was kidding. Did you season these? Mm. Nutmeg. Gotcha. I'm hungry. Don't eat my peach. I didn't eat it. Kim. Kim. Kimmy. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that. Hello? Hello? Anyone out there? Anybody out there? Just nod if you can hear me. Hello? Anyone out there? If you can hear me, we're safe. We need batteries. There are trollers around. We're up Canyon Road. Follow the two oak trees. Don't tell them where we are. If you keep traveling-- Don't tell them where we are. We got to give them a chance. Idiot. You don't want anyone to find us. We need batteries, food. Are you crazy? Speak up if you're out there, you hear me, assholes? [walkie talkie static] Hello? What's gotten into you? Huh? We need help, Mike. Hey, don't tell them where we are. It's you and me, babe. Don't forget dish soap if you find it. Yeah. Okay. What if I came with you? I don't think that's a good idea. It's dangerous out there. Then don't go. Then we'll starve. See you tonight. Be safe. You, too. [sings tune] [repeats tune] Hello? Can anyone hear me? [Mike] Did Erica sound infected? Do they ever sound infected? Maybe I'm infected. Stop it. Maybe I am. Don't say that. I'm the one who's going out there every day. You could be. Then we're all fucked, hmm? [Mike] I need to show you something. Okay. What is it? It's not in the water. What is this? I found these news reports in a house on a printer. They're not dated that long ago, okay? It's new information. It's all we got. "No hope. Communication's down. Virus spreads. Paranoia in unwitting hosts. Avoid anyone with black eyes or black blood. It might be you. I know. Take solace in death." I mean... It's not in the water, though, look. What the fuck? It's not water? What are you talking about? Look at what this says, "No hope from CDC. There's no hope. Too late. I know, but-- Listen. Wait. Communications down." This is what it keeps saying. Shh. It keeps saying we should keep holding on. For what? What the fuck's the point? Keep it down. Just keep it down. Okay. I haven't been out there in six months. I have no idea what it's like. We've been through this. Every time I walk out the door I don't know if I'm coming back. [Kim] I could go with you. [Mike] And do what? Help. I could bring back more food. What, do you think, I'm hiding something from you? [Kim] I don't know. [Mike] What do you mean you don't know? [Kim] I haven't been out there. [Mike] I'm doing this for you. Doing this for us. Every mark on that fridge is one of them. I'm going out to the Canyon Market. I hear these noises, right? I'm coming down the aisles. I'm backing away and this, like, hissing, this growling... I whip around and it's this little girl, she's coming at me and she's fast. I hit her in the face. And then she's up and it didn't even phase her. She's clawing at me, she's hissing at me, she's drooling. I grab her hair and I... I just grab this penknife... I just, I just jabbed it in her chest. Just wouldn't go in. She was just still with the black eyes and the hatred and... We don't know how many of them are out there. All they want to do is kill you. That's it. That's all they want to do. You can't go out there, Kim. I can't let you go out there. [static crackles] [creaking] [creaking] [child crying] [radio static] [Kim] Hello, hello? Hello? Anyone out there? Hello? Hello? [whistle blows in distance] [running footsteps] [knocking in rhythm] How was your day? Good. What did you get? Batteries, good. Four. Batteries, batteries, radio... Dish soap, did you get dish soap? Oh, fuck. No. I totally forgot. I'm sorry. You didn't get dish soap? I wrote a list. I know we need it. I... I didn't even see it. I don't think they had any where I was anyway. We'll probably get three days out of this. Close your eyes. Okay. I got you... the most beautiful... dress. You're going to love it. Probably needs to be washed. It's nice, right? [sighs] [sighs] Mmm. [Kim] Thanks. You look beautiful. Mm. Thank you. How's your hand? Mm, it's fine. Cheers. Cheers. [laughs] [growling in distance] [growling] [whimpering] I thought you took care of her. I thought I did, too. [whimpering] [fierce growl] [thud] Shh. Teddy, go away, honey. Go away. Shh. [growling] Go away, Teddy. [scraping] [whining] Shh. [scraping] [whining] What are you doing? Smoking a cigarette. They'll smell it. Quality of life. Okay? These freaks aren't going to smell it. Get up here. Quality of life, my ass. I'm so hungry. I'm so hungry. I'm hungry. [laughs] I'm so hungry. Stop it. Stop it. Baby, maybe we're just both crazy. What if we're, like, in The Truman Show ? There is-- There is no plague. And... there's cameras everywhere. And they're just watching us. Everything we do? Everything. Ed Harris is the voice of God. Ed Harris is the voice of God. Hold on. Sitting on a park bench. [Kim] Hello. Hello? [yells] Hey. Jesus! [Mike] Do you trust me? Trust me? Do you trust me? Do you trust me? Mm-hmm. Say it. I do. I do. [whistle blows in distance] [Mike] I keep having to go further and further. Just not a lot of food out there. What do you think? Hmm? You always get this wrong. It goes like this. [Mike] What would I do without you? Ah. I got it wrong. Mm. Nice and pink. It's almost like champagne. It's a ros?. Ros?. Mmm. Ages well. That it does. I think we should start hunting again. No way. I'm not eating coyote. Any animal meat could be infected. It was three months ago. No. No way. That was one random event. It doesn't matter. It still could be contaminated. Look at what happened last time. If I kill it and it doesn't come back to life, that's good enough for me. [Mike sighs] [growling] [baby crying] [creaking] I was in here. And then... What if he took them and he's... not coming back? [grunting] [snarling] He didn't know about the toys. No, I kept very good care of them. [Man on radio] Hello? Hello? Hello? [Man on radio] Hello? Hello? Can you hear me? [Man on radio] Hello! Yes! Can you hear me? [Man on radio] Yes, we can hear you. Who am I speaking to? This is Kim. Listen, this is Ranger Mark Rand. Okay. I'm part of a rescue team. We've been running sorties up and down the coast looking for survivors. Kim, how many people are in your party? Uh... There's two, there's two in my party. Have you been exposed to any infected? Anyone with black blood or eyes? Delusional, distrustful of loved ones? Kim, I'm going to need specifics. What are your names? I'm with Mike. Where is Mike, Kim? Mike is in the other... Mike is not here. Is Mike hurt, Kim? No. Where did Mike go? Mike is outside. You have to find Mike, too. Are you sure he's not infected? Can you tell me where you are? Do you know where I am? I'm in a-- I'm in a house. Kim. Kim. I'm going to need you to relax, Kim, okay? It's perfectly normal to be scared. Okay. Where did Mike go, Kim? You're going to have to tell us. Where did Mike go? I don't know where he went exactly. There's a large community of us, survivors. We're going to bring you to them. Okay. Okay, okay. I'm here. How long have you been alone, Kim? Uh... I don't know. The sun was not... very high when he left and it's... four hours maybe? Five? I-- I don't know. I'm... [rattling] I don't know how long I've been here. Kim, stay on this channel. I'll call you once we know you're secure. [radio static] Hello? Hello? [Kim] Are you there? [whistle blowing in distance] [knocking in rhythm] Hey. Hi. Did you take anything this last time before you went out? No. What? I'm just missing something. No, I didn't. Because everything is... I know where everything is so I notice when something's gone. Did you take something? No. Are you sure? Yeah. One of the cabinets, there's some-- No, they're all empty. I don't-- No. Why? You know what I'm talking about, Mike. It's not fair. It's not fair that you took them. Why did you take them? Tell me what you did with them. I buried them. With our baby. [Kim] Wait, no, maybe... Maybe there's another way-- [Mike] Stop doing this, okay? Stop doing this to yourself. It's too late. She's gone. They'll find a cure. [baby fussing] I have to do this. You know I have to do this. [baby crying] [ax whacking] [singing melody] I forgot the words. [singing melody] [dull strum] [pipe creaking] Where did I put that? Mm... [hissing] [hissing] [rustling] [low growling] [clatter] [gasps] [low growling] I'm just going to... [low growling] [whistle blowing in distance] [rhythmic knocking] Did you see anyone? A few. Three more. Yeah. I just saw someone outside. What? Just a minute ago. I didn't see them. The water's out, too. I was washing a dish and it just stopped. [faucet squeaking] What happened? What did you do? What happened? I didn't do anything. I was doing the dishes and it just stopped. It might be just a pipe thing. If it lasts for a century, this reservoir... I don't know if it would last for a century. It's just what I said. I'm sorry. It'll be fine. It'll be fine. I'll fix it. I'll fix it. What do we got, this? [sighs] Fuck! I'll fix it. [Mike] We can't keep doing this. [Kim] What if this is it? [Mike] Don't say that. [Kim] You go out every single day, you've never seen a survivor. You keep coming back with less batteries, less bullets, less food. You say there's no order. There's nothing out there. What if this is it? We have a responsibility. [Kim] What are you talking about? [Mike] You know, we're young, smart, we're healthy. We survived. Are you kidding me? The only way to win is to, is by outlasting them. Okay, so now you're going to quote Darwin on me? Man had a point. [Kim] Crisco and lasagna, that's my meal for today. Out survive them? You're insane. You totally fucking lost it. It is insane out there. And now you're totally fucking insane. No. No, this makes sense. No, it doesn't make any sense. This is why we're here. No, there's no reason-- Shh! [whispers] Keep your voice down. [Mike] No. [Kim] You totally fucking lost it. You go out every single day and you come out just a little bit more insane every single day. This is why we're here. We're human beings. This is why we're here. Tomorrow I'm going to go out to that Toyota, I'm going to drive to the ocean. I'm going to find one of those big fucking five bedroom houses, okay? And it's going to be full of clothes and food and Ensure and baby food. We're going to live by the ocean. I'm going to get us one of those. We can run a generator. We'll have electricity. Nobody will hear it over the waves. It'll be okay. Don't leave me alone. I won't leave you alone. We can do this. [pasta snaps] [crunching] Be safe. Keep moving. When I come back, I'll be bringing you back to our new beach house. Hmm. I love you. I love you, too. [humming melody] Smoke on the Water. Just in case. Take them all. [cocks rifle] [pills rattle] [humming melody] Do you remember the song? Were you listening? You're right. He's going to come home. What do you mean, why am I not doing anything? I'm keeping watch. [Kim] I can protect this place. You don't need a gun. I've got... a tennis racket and... a wrench. I have two machetes. And... a bat. You can kill with a bat. Um... [creaking] [thump] [baby fussing] [screeches] [creaking] [snarling] [growling] [thumping] [barking] [scraping] [loud thumping] [barking and growling] [thumping] [barking and snarling] [low growling] [whispering] Teddy. Shh. Teddy, Teddy... Go away, honey, go away. [growling] [dog whining and panting] Oh, g-- [radio static] Hello. This is Ranger Mark Rand. Ranger Mark... This is Kim. Can you hear me? Kim? Kim, are you there? Yes, yes, I'm here, I'm here. Kim, are you okay? I'm okay. I'm... My dog's outside. Did you hear me? My dog's outside. Forget the dog. Okay. Where are you? Hello? Where are you? [Ranger] Listen, you need to do us a favor, otherwise, we can't help you. You have to tell me, can you describe yourself? I am-- I'm five seven, I have blond hair, and... blue-green eyes, and... Wha-- What do you need? [Ranger] Are you fat? No. I mean, I haven't eaten in, like, six months. What are you talking about? How can you-- how can you tell me that you're-- [Ranger] Can I call you Kimmy, Kim? My name is Kim. My name is Kim. I want you to-- [Ranger] Tell me about your dresses, Kimmy. Uh... [Ranger] It's nice to feel pretty, isn't it, for a woman? Mark... I want you to start calling me Kim! Kim! [Ranger] I wouldn't make so much noise, Kim, that attracts attention. [whispers] Okay, okay, okay. I'm quiet now. [Ranger] I'm just looking out for your interests. I'll be quiet. I am going to be quiet now, Mark. Mark... Hello? Please, are you there? I don't want you to leave me again. Shh. He just went away for a second. I think he's going to come back. [low growling] Cheers. [chuckles softly] [yelp] [distorted growling] Mike? Hey, honey. How'd you get in? Shh. [whispers] I didn't. I'm not here. When are you coming home? Oh, I'm never coming home. I was going to wait up for you. I don't know why you do that. Good night. You should try and get some sleep. [screaming] Why did you kill us? Why? Why did you kill us? Why? Why did you kill us? Why? Why? Why did you kill us? [scratching] [rattling] [gasping] [panting] [baby crying] [yelling] [sobbing] Oh, God. [screaming] [sobbing] Oh, God. Oh, God. [Ranger] Attention, Kim. Are you there, bitch? Who is this? [Ranger] You're a fucking liar, Kim. A fucking liar, aren't you? Are you happy, you bitch? No. [Ranger] Good. Does that mean you're starting to see what a bad person you are? I am not a bad person. You're not a good person, are you, Kim? I am... Ranger Mark, I am not a bad person. Kim, just admit it. You killed Todd... then you killed Erica... and then you killed your child. No, Ranger Mark. No. Mike killed Todd. No wonder Mike left you, you psychotic bitch. And then I... Who are you? Do you feel safe? I don't know. I don't know if I feel safe. Which dress are you wearing right now? Which dress is your favorite dress? There are people outside all around the house. There are trollers. [Ranger] Do you think I'm a troller? [faucet running in distance] [deep snarling] [yells] [screeching] [grunting and thumping] [screeching] [thumping] [snarling] [thumping on roof] [screeching] [snarling] [Kim yelling] [panting] [snarling] [footsteps] [panting] Mike. Hello. Is anyone there? Hello, Ranger Mike? Mark, Mark, Mark. [snarling] [yelling] Stop! [snarling] [yelling] Yeah, you. Yeah, you. You stop! [screeching] [screams] [panting] [rapid knocking] [Mike] Hey. You got the knock wrong. What? Let me in. No, do it again, do it again. That's the knock. Sitting on a park bench. No, we changed the song. What are you fucking talking about? That's the knock. No. It's not the knock. I don't remember the fucking knock. What is it, Iron Man ? You never forget it. You never fucking forget the knock. [humming melody] No, that's not right. I'm fucking here. Let me in. Let me fucking in the door. What is the song? Let me in. What happened to your arms? Let me in. What happened to your arms? Huh? Where's the shotgun, Mike? Where's the shotgun? I lost the fucking shotgun. Goddamn it, let me in. [pounds door] Are you fucking kidding me? I'm right here. Let me come in. What happened to your arms? I was attacked at this house. They had plenty of food, everything. These five freaks jumped me and I had to jump out the window. Just let me in. What happened to your arm? I told you. Look, I jumped through a fucking window. Did any of them touch you? Did any of them touch you, Mike? Did any of them touch you? No, nobody touched me. I'd be fucking bat-shit crazy by now, you know that. Look, baby, honey, you can interrogate me when I get in. Okay? What's the song? Honey, you got to let me in. I can't. Honey. Honey, they're out here. You got to let me in. [knocking on door] Open the fucking door. You know, I think you would appreciate my fucking anxiety out here. Okay? Your anxiety out there? Look, I'm not-- You don't know my anxiety in here. You don't know what happened here last night. Baby, you can trust me. Baby... I'm sorry I left, okay? I'm sorry I fucking left. Let me in. We're going to get our fucking shit and get out of here. We'll burn this fucking cabin down. Let me in the door. [pounding on door] Let me in the door! Listen... you did a real good job last night, okay? Let me in. I'm right here. I'm going to take care of you. Okay? I'm not going to let you in. I don't remember the goddamn knock. [pounding] I don't remember the goddamn knock! You never forget the knock. Just do the knock. Kimmy, you know what this reminds me of? Huh? What? What? What does this fucking remind you of? Freaking Rosarito. Oh, God, shut up, shut up. Remember that? We drank, like, two cases of beer. You peed on the fucking bed. You were so annoyed with me. You peed on the fucking bed. You peed on the bed. You peed on the bed. And you were so fucking annoyed with me I left and I got clean sheets and then you fucking passed out. And you locked me outside. Honey... I can't. You don't know the song. Honey, they're out here. Just... Honey, they're out here. You got to let me in. I'm going to break down the fucking door if you don't let me in. Kim, let me fucking-- [pounds on door] [pounding] Kim! [pounding] Kim! Let me in the door. Fuck. Shit. Okay. [screaming] Open the door, huh? I told you to let me in. What the fuck are you doing? [Mike yells] Oh! Kim! Move this fucking table! [Kim yells] You fucking bitch! Let me in this fucking room! [screaming] [crying] [lock unlatches] [door creaks] [footsteps] [loud crack] [exhales] Thanks for the bandages. Look at your blood, Mike. Yeah. Because you cut my fucking fingers off. Look at it. It's black, Mike. The blood is black. No. Yes. Baby, it's not. You're seeing things. No. No. Unh-unh. Baby, you got to let me go, okay? No. You tried to kill me. No. What are you talking about? You tried to kill me last night. What? You came in through the window. I saw you come in through the window. No, no, no. Calm down. That wasn't... I wasn't even here. No, it was you. I saw it. Why did you come last night, Mike? That wasn't me. We got to be rational here. Okay? Kimmy... Don't tell me to be rational, Mike. You tried to fucking kill me last night. I don't have to be rational. That wasn't me. I feed you. I kept you safe. I never get to leave. You get to leave. You leave me every day. I'm here all alone. All alone. You don't know what it's like to be here all alone. Without Lily. [whispers] Okay. [groans] Fuck! Baby, hey, hey... Stop talking. Just stop talking! I need to figure this out. Come on, let's work through this. We can work through this. Okay, you and me. We've always worked through it. I'm trying to fucking think. Shut the fuck up! Okay, okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I am not incapable, Mike! I can leave this goddamn cabin, and I'll be fucking fine! I do not need you! You kept me in here for the past six fucking months. No. Yes! Yes, babe. Yes, yes, yes, you have. Yes, you've kept me in here, like a fucking caged animal. You've turned, Mike. You're not who you think you are. No I haven't. Unh-unh. Look at you. No, I haven't. There's fucking black blood all over you. What happened? I came back for you. Baby, I love you. Look into my eyes. What do you see? What am I looking at? Right there. What? What? Your fucking eyes. Tell me what you're seeing. Look at your fucking eyes! I'm in pain, baby. Come on, you got to let me go. You can't leave. You can't leave without me. Baby, come here. Come here. Come here. What do you see? Huh? I see black eyes. I don't see the person that I used to love. I look at everything we had and I know it's not you. Had, had, had, Kim, had. Unh-unh. I found a place for us on the ocean, okay? We're going to go. Baby, I'd never hurt you. You know that, right? Baby, I love you so much. You cut off my fucking fingers. [crying] Let me out of this chair. Don't do it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Don't. Don't, don't, don't. [Mike yelling] [hissing] [Mike yelling] [grunting] [snarling] [Mike gasps] [chatter]
