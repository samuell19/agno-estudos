(Bubbling Sounds) (Eerie Music) (Bubbling Sounds) we live in a world subject to constant change every second of every minute of every hour changes take place these changes are perhaps invisible to us because our level of awareness is limited take for example how the things we do and say to the people we meet all these things affect our lives influence our destiny and yet there seems to be some kind of fantastic order to the whole thing we never know how or when we will meet a person who will become a catalyst or who will lead us to what what is a catalyst well in this case a catalyst is a person that will bring about changes they could be good or bad but there will be changes these a meet one almost anywhere your everyday life in the supermarket draw the story anyway even writing down the floor to turn back a pretty girl with a problem who could resist certainly not worship this place is like a madhouse some of my sister's friends are pretty far out you sound as if you don't approve them oh no it's not that it's just that a lot of them are heavy into the drug scene you mean they smoke pot that too but I was referring to things worse than pop I know try I'm glad you have it I'd appreciate it if you don't why you're here don't you say mr. rain hello no thank you that's not for me one little toke isn't gonna hurt oh you know your body's the temple of the Holy Spirit you shouldn't get fired and we shouldn't eat final minute I hope you're not gonna be a dragon folk scriptural night I'm gonna go change clothes make yourself at home that'll be long I will thank you thank you you're so big I like my face and you must be very strong and you know dutiful and you have a boyfriend you shouldn't be acting this er with me especially when you were someone else you've got to be putting me on God doesn't mind if I like someone else I just don't go for a girl that acts like a tramp even if she's very beautiful well thanks a lot you're nothing but a dumb bastard who doesn't know where it's at anyway what's that useful thing I've just been insulted he called me a tramp no why should i insult you well it does hey baby I'm sorry where is this junk come on I'll have it right now it's him over there Herschel ancestors friend well nothing I think I think I've got a much better way to teach him this is my sister angel this is Bob door sure don't get her started my sister thinks the whole world the church and she's the preacher I believe therefore I see my sister she's a girl but this Bible stuff is really a drag anything she can dig I can dig well whatever turns you on praise the Lord what is this in tea God says that anything that is not a faith is sin what about adulthood isn't that a sin he says we commit adultery with sticks and stones I think you have to go to the Holy Spirit to make that real to you we love him because he first loved us if a man say I love God and hateth his brother he's a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he had seen how can he love God whom he has not seen and this commandment we have from him that he who loveth God love his brother also do you go by those Commandments he says followed after the spirit not the flesh now God is spirit when he says to study to show ourselves approved we have no need that any man teaching but when the Holy Spirit of promises comes he'll guide us to all truth I think I'd better go along would you like to come along sure yeah this is gonna be some night I think a bigger with angel boy what kind of AD elf are you go ahead turn into a Bible freak see who gives a damn thing please why

make you really good come on but it won't I mean it wouldn't hurt me will it when I do that to you baby this guy you're one of my favorite you ever think about this fantastic order of things and how far does it go you know most people go through life completely oblivious to the obvious things that predictably influence their destiny Herschel was meant to beautiful girl it's conservative responsible concerned with and contribute their time and efforts to the benefit of her fellow man the other is the opposite or is she who are we to judge strange how many people will argue interpretations of the Bible Hershel has much to be grateful for it he's strong he's handsome and he enjoys being attractive to the opposition and he feels that when he comments that his words deserve the consideration of this these Bible students these seekers of the truth and as he plays his game of wits we go his comments could be what caused the chain of events and the moments of horror and agony that were far greater than his experiences in the hell of the event Hershel a time you're thinking interesting I wish we had time to cover it more thoroughly what are your plans and probably the Lord's on our side you know yeah how we'll ask them to look for a job that's easy I could use a husky man like you out of my poultry ranch if you can wait till next week already do just general work

less a man than Herschel how bad is that but remember that the paths of life predictable and we repeat them again and again right Oh you should have set the alarm you know I promised angel I go to the

to God it's a basic instinct in mankind is a few the moments of great trouble this appeal for help from a from a source that they play games with scoff at when things are going well their word of caution remember to be careful what you pay for we've been everywhere you heard anything from him yet he's here here yes here you're not gonna believe this it's a weird it it's like I just start

sorry that turkey I went to hell I told them not to conduct any experiments unless I was here are you all right I don't think so have you been taking any other drugs yeah I spent some time in Vietnam hostile I've been burned pretty bad so they didn't feeding me some drugs to kill the pain and it wasn't enough so I took some my mail since then I only smoke pot was much more than that fuck here let me help you inside I'll call angel she won't know what to do we've been working together down at the Center for addicts here no listen there's going to be a nice bonus in this guy's when this is all over but you have to swear to me right now that you'll keep your mouth shut is it a deal how's he doing has there been any change huh he's resting well and eating but no sir he still looks the same and he must think things are really gonna get hairy if he's offering us bonuses well we said we'd keep our mouth shut but we didn't say anything about staying did it what happened to him Tong I was afraid of something like that happening you'd be able to ride his bike I'll come pick him up I want to call him first and I'll be right over goodbye Hershel is feeling them what's wrong I'm not sure something about finding a path down listen any drugs with him oh no oh no angel no what is it an angel it's all my fault you know I was trying to make him jealous but he wouldn't pay any attention to me what's the matter where did you get listen I'm going out to pick him up now you want to go alone no no no I couldn't say some more concrete and your personal understand angel he's in withdrawal I think he must have been elucidating what must have happened my laboratory men used him in an experiment not knowing that he was an addict if I can be of any help call me Ian told me what she and I did she's really sorry ma why or well she didn't understand that you are already addicted she wouldn't have done it and I thought you loved me she does look we don't always understand purpose and why things happen we've got to have think feint all the faith I had I lost you can get it back ask God to increase your name please truck Oh Lord my god help me help me once more let's go there's much to warn us all of the trends our destinies taking our scientists agree that the one immutable law of life has changed there's much talk and protests about everything about pollution about drugs and their abuse and this has been a story based partly on fact partly on probability but the horrors that occur in the minds of those who allow the indiscriminate use of the human body as a mixing bowl for drug for the chemicals are as real as the real horror so when you eat or take into your body any chemical or drugs you take a chance on reactions that are untested unpredictable there are government agencies many responsible groups fighting the use of chemicals in the food we eat the water we drink and yet there are part far too many of us to go right on taking the good way of life for granted ignoring the warnings so let's give a little thought to making our own story (cough) have a happy ending (coughing) (Soft Music)
