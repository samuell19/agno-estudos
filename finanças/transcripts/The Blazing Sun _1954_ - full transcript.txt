A dawn of a new day, a day we waited for impatiently When I was a kid I often asked myself why the sugar company refuses to buy our sugar cane and buys from the Pasha. Until I grew up and went to an agricultural faculty and there I knew why. Since I came back, five months ago we work together with a new system. We work hard and struggle in the hope that our sugar cane will be better than that of the Pasha To be number one and we can sell it to the company. Today the peasants, my countrymen are going to the fields as they do every day like their fathers and grandfathers have done for thousands of years. Every girl carries her jar. The men drive the livestock. And the water wheels turn to irrigate the land. But today everyone's heart is praying to god because today we will know the outcome. The outcome of the work we invested all our hopes in. Today news will arrive from the company. Hearts full of hope, but patience has run out. All eyes are on the bridge waiting for the news to come. Oh god, I promised them success. God bless my first job. Help me, my god. Oh god... Oh god. What's the news? Tell us, speak up We will never forget what you did for us - Ahmed - Ahmed You brought us happiness, wealth to our home, may god bless you. Yes pray for him our Sheik, may god give him strength and succeed again next year. May god make this year pass peacefully Saber Effendi Ahmed did his part, may god take care of the rest. - Yes god willing. - Father. Your wedding tonight Saleem? Yes father. Ask from god that all be well Amen - Grandpa, will you buy me the palm tree? - With god's will my son. What's wrong with you today, our Sheik? May god keeps away the evil that we don't see, Saber Effendi What brought you here? What's wrong? - The news is not good. - Speak up. - Their sugar cane is number one. - What? Now you believe me, Riad Bay, this Ahmed boy did it. What will you say to the Pasha? Enjoy your drink. Go to the field and tell Saber Effendi... Saber Effendi is celebrating with them, he is happy with his son. Enjoy your drink. Enjoy it as well. Hamid, Hamid. - Come here Hamid, where is the Pasha? - At the eastern terrace sir - Give me the head clerk. - My uncle Pasha No telegraphs from Cairo? Strange, listen as soon as a telegraph arrives read it to me on the phone. What? No, not now. I can't understand why Amal hasn't send a telegraph yet. - You want something, Riad? - Yes uncle but... Leave us alone. We are alone now, speak up. The Ahmed project succeeded, the peasants cane is number one - and yours is number two - What? The company will buy from them first with the highest price - then you ask them... - Ask them! Or beg them? This dog, ungrateful criminal. After I raised and educated him with my money. When you said to Saber Effendi how can your son work for the peasants? Saber said I tried, but he said the Pasha can find someone better, but the peasants have only me. Yes you're right, it was my fault. And now they have money they will ignore your orders. Those dirty dogs! Be sure that I'm still the same and they are my servants living under my feet. They will not sell their crop nor will Ahmed work for them. Uncle, I have an idea. What? A cat... We drench it in gasoline, set it on fire and release it in their fields The crop will be gone and all of Ahmed's projects. This is a stupid plan and it's dangerous. Riad, the Nile is running high, we'll open the dam gate, the water will destroy their crops. And destroy their livestock and their homes. - Come with me. - Great. - Telephone for you sir - Tell her, tell him I'm not here Won't you stop playing around? Good morning, my Pasha, good morning Riad Bay. My son has succeeded, it's the happiest day of my life, my Pasha. It's true that a good son is the best gift from god. - What is it, Saber Effendi? - The peasant's cane is number one. - Really?! - It's true, Riad Bay - Your son must be happy. - Ahmed? He can't be any happier. - And the peasants must be celebrating. - Yes, yes. - That's great. - May god bless and give more. We pray to the lord Come in. I won't sell my cane to the company until they buy all of the peasants' cane. You are so generous, my Pasha. - Leave me now Saber Effendi - Yes? - Saber Effendi, give my best regards to Ahmed - Thank you sir. Yes, yes, really? OK, thank you. My daughter Amal sent a telegram, her train will arrive in half an hour. - What a great surprise. - Hassan! Not a surprise, I received a letter from her this morning. - Strange you didn't tell me. - The other problem distracted me. - Prepare the car for the lady. - Yes sir. Go Riad and wait for her at the station. Hurry up. Hamid, Hamid. - Yes? - Did you prepare the lady's room? Tell the gardeners to pick some roses for her room. All over the house, all roses, move. - Where is she, my lady, I missed her so much. - She's arriving. My heart is beating so fast, I haven't seen her for 8 years. Welcome home. If I known, I'd have flown to Cairo to bring you home. To keep you company I was doing fine - I sent letters to your school address, did you receive them? - Yes. Strange, why did you never answer? Amal? - Yes? - Answer me. - With what? - What did you say? - Did you read my letters? - Yes. - I wrote poetry to you. - I think so. You must have memorized it. - I couldn't understand it. - But it was my own creation. That's what I thought. - Potato, Potato! - Stop, stop, stop! - Why should I stop? - Go back! Move it. That's enough. Potato? Ahmed... How are you? Welcome back. - Strange, you've grown too tall. - I tried to stay short... But I couldn't. No but... - How are you Ahmed? - I'm fine thanks. - Remember playing together as kids? - How can I forget. - Know what I was thinking before you called me potato? - What? - About my doll you took from me. - Really? Do you remember why I took it from you? Because you took my hat! You ran after me and I fell to my knees, it hurt but I wouldn't cry. - You kept looking at me to come to you. - But you were stubborn and wouldn't. - So you cried. - No, I didn't cry. - Yes you did. - No I didn't. Yes I think I did. And you laughed at me. But in the end I came to you and helped you up, and wiped away your tears. How are you Ahmed? - How are you Amal - Who's that? It's Nafe my friend. - Yes, we play together. - Come here. No, you want to take my hat. He's so cute. I have to go, my father's waiting. I hope to see you again, Nafe. You want to see me? - See you, Ahmed. - Goodbye. - See you, Nafe. - See you, potato. Uncle Ahmed, who is she, this potato? - The daughter of the Pasha. - Oh good. Welcome back, welcome back. Amal my darling. - How are you dad? - Just one kiss? Give me more. - I should have gone to the station. - Thanks, Riad did that. - Happy to be back? - Very much, I wish I was returning every year. Isn't it too hot for you down here? She's just shy, uncle. Shy? She's no longer a little girl. She's all grown up now. Isn't it so Amal? - Yes dad. - You're so pretty but I've grown so old. - No dad, you look 20 years old. - Really? - Really. - Phone from the bank. - I'm not here. - Tell me darling... - It's the bank, uncle. Go ahead dad, I'll go and change. Yes. it's me. - Welcome, lady Amal. - OmAlhana. how are you. Welcome, welcome. - Amal, I... - Just a minute, Riad. - I missed you a lot. - I missed you more, my child. - You came and brought happiness again. - What happiness? You don't know? The whole village is celebrating. Why? - Do you know who made us so happy? - Who? - Do you remember the boy you used to play with? - Who? - Ahmed, Saber's son. - Ahmed? If you could see him now, he looks so fine. - I saw him. - How did you recognize him? I didn't know him, he called me potato! Really, like he used to call you as kids? What are you looking for? Ahmed's hat?! Ahmed's hat. - Aunt Tafida, where's my bag? - I didn't see it. Here it is. The food's hot, come before it gets cold. - Give me my doll. - Give me my hat. - No, the doll. - Give me the hat. Ahmed. You would have never dreamed of being the village's hero. Where is it? I hope you will find a good wife now. What d'you say, aren't you thinking of a doll? I... really Just say the word and I'll look for one for you. Ahmed, Ahmed! - We'll talk about this later. - What's going on here? The food's getting cold again. It's potatoes, Ahmed. Potatoes, yes I'm coming. - Come now. - I'm coming. - Ahmed? - Yes? - Saleem's wedding is tonight. - Yes. I hope to see yours. - Tell me what the Bay sent to slaughter? - A big buffalo. - Has it been served yet? - No. - Thank god. Move out of the way everyone, Lady Amal is here. Welcome Lady Amal. - Where's the sheik to congratulate him? - He's inside. Welcome, welcome, it's a great honor. Father, Lady Amal came to congratulate you. - Congratulations, my sheik - Thank you child, you should have rested. The feet take you where you love to go. - And where's Riad Bay? - I think he left for the city. - My father wanted to come but was tired. - May god give him health. He is a good man and humble. - What are you laughing at Nafe? - Nothing. I want to see the bride, to congratulate her, excuse me. - Make yourself at home. - Go with her Nafe. I wish I'd brought you a gift from Cairo but I didn't know. Please accept this instead. Look, it's great. Welcome, it's a great honor, the daughter of the Pasha here. Aunt OmAlahana, you stay here, I'm leaving. - What? And who will take you home? - Just stay here. - Please excuse me now. - Congratulations. - Miss Amal. - Let's go. How can you go back alone, my lady? - Nafe will take me back. - Nafe? How come? - Am I not a man?! - Shut up, kid! I will go back alone, Saber Effendi. Your boat is small, the current is strong and it's dark now, You can't go alone, my child, you need someone to row for you. - Uncle Ahmed is good in rowing. - Yes him, Ahmed. Come my son, come to escort the lady. None of you, I will escort her. There's no need for all this. Not at all, please come. Salam Alikum. See you, potato. Uncle Ahmed, Uncle Ahmed, see you. Potato. - Just like the old days. - Like the years never passed. - Do you remember this water wheel? - Of course I remember it. - Ahmed, where's my doll? - I still have it. Since you left every time I'm alone I look at it and say; I wonder if you still remember me, potato. - I remember your foolishness when you'd jump over the water wheel. - Foolishness? What? You're still a fool?! Come down. - But tell me... - What? You were thinking of me? Once we had a new teacher and I looked at him and said I hope that Ahmed looks that handsome when he's grown up. Ahmed... - Ahmed... - Yes? Let's go to the rock and sit there. - How come the rock is so faraway? - It's you that's gone faraway. - I'm mad at you. - Mad at me? All the way in the train, I was thinking, I thought you would be waiting for me. But I found this fool Riad alone. I was angry, I wore a beautiful dress and did my hair to show you how wrong you were when you used to tell me I'm ugly. But who would think such a tiny thing would grow up to be so beautiful. - Me a tiny thing? - Didn't I carry you all the time. - You? - And you had a broken tooth. - Me?! - And you were lisping. - Me lisping?! - You talked so funny. - What's wrong Ahmed? - I'm sorry, I went too far. Are you kidding me? I forgot you're the daughter of the great Pasha and I'm the son of his employee. - What are you saying? What's wrong? - When we were young... - You'd come to our palace. - And watch the parties behind the wall. - Ahmed, don't say that. - My shoes were torn and I looked awful. you invited me in, I couldn't say no but I just stood there, I wanted to leave but I couldn't I was afraid to walk, your friends notice my broken, open shoes and laugh at me. Ahmed, even I was a stranger among them. When my dad asked me to come back, I was so happy. And when you called me potato, I was so disturbed. I left the car and came to you and I didn't want to leave. - Amal, I meant... - Now what? - Nothing. - Then smile. Now take me back home. What are you waiting for, let's eat. - Be patient, Hassan. - I'm hungry, my Sheik. Let's eat, no need to wait for Ahmed. - Should I go to call him. - Stay, it's a dark night. What? Where's this water is coming from? - My god, the village is flooded. - How come. Saleem! The Pasha is so sad and said if he wasn't sick he would come himself. - Saber Effendi. - Yes, my sheik? - I want a word with you, alone. - Right. I will come back. - Are you really sad for this disaster? - If there is anything I can do... - You can, Saber. - What? - Know where this came from. - What are you trying to say? There's a hand that played with the dam, a strong, bold hand. I don't understand. - The hand I'm talking about is from the other bank of the river. - The other bank? - From your side. - Our side?! - Don't say that it was the hand of god. - Leave the hand of god alone, I know which hand it was and you must do something about it. What's the matter with you, what are you saying? I mean that with your position you know very well. You mean I know something but hide it? I'm an honest and clean man. - Everything changes but god. - No one dares to talk to me like that, If you weren't an old, blind man I'd teach you a lesson. Teach yourself a lesson and repent. I swear I won't forget this. Father, why do you two fight, what happened? - Call Nafe for me. Where you going, father? - To the Pasha. - To complain about Saber Effendi? - But father... - I said call Nafe, call Nafe. Oh god, give us strength. Nafe, Nafe! NO, less than 60 pounds per acre. I won't sell. Don't try, wasn't that the price you were going to pay them? 59 now. Yes 60. Deal, good bye. - Congratulations, Pasha. - A thousands acres at 60 pounds, 60,000 pounds. I never dreamed of this price. One man's disaster is another's blessing. The most important thing is no one knows where the disaster came from. Come in. What? - Sheik Abdul Samad is outside my Pasha. - Outside where? - The hall, sir - OK. What brings him here now? Welcome, I was thinking about visiting you. Hamid, coffee for the sheik. No need, I'm in a hurry. I want a few words with you alone. - Of course, come inside. - Wait here, Nafe. Nafe, come. Come in. - Sit down my sheik. - Is anybody with us in the room. - No not at all, please sit down. I didn't came here to sit down. - I came to ask a question and hope you will answer it. - Go on. Who do you think opened the dam? - Strange, didn't it open by itself? - And how can it open by itself, Pasha? - Strange, you mean... - I mean it was done on purpose. - On purpose?! - Someone did it. - Really? Yes really, Pasha. - Someone must hate you. - For a long time. - And you know him? - Only I know who. - Why don't you say who. - The one who will benefit from it. Your words are mysterious. The one who didn't want to see the people achieve wealth, so he flooded them. The one whose cane is safe and the company will buy it. You mean me, me! Speak up! Are you crazy? Can't you see who you're talking to? - Actually I can't see, my Pasha. - When you're blind don't speak big words. You mock my blindness? My sight is blind, but you are blind in your heart. God knows you are a heretic and in partnership with the devil. Riad, throw him out! Is the devil here? Welcome. - My sheik... - Shut up! I'm leaving Pasha, but I swear by god if I don't receive tomorrow morning the money the company were to pay us I will reveal your secret to the people. And when they know the truth they will eat you alive, tear you to pieces and throw you to the dogs. - Nafe, Nafe! - Your grandpa's calling you. My sheik. My sheik, please accept this, I want to help with something. Thank you my child, the Pasha will take care of everything. No one can threaten me, and who is he? - A dirty, blind and barefoot peasant. - You should have been nicer with him. How can I pay 120 or 130 thousand pounds? Why did you flood their lands, if mine flooded I wouldn't lose so much. - Come in! - Saber Effendi... - I don't want... - Let him in, Hamid. - If you allow it Pasha - Why do you want to see him now? Hassan told me that Saber had a fight with sheik Abdul Samad. - What's this got to do with our problem? - You'll see now, come in. Let me handle it. Welcome, Saber Effendi, the Pasha was about to send for you. - Your orders sir. - We will travel to withdraw from the bank, how much? 130,000 pounds for now. This is a donation from the Pasha. And tomorrow we will give it to the sheik and he will distribute it himself. This is very generous of you Pasha, but please leave me out of it. Actually, I had a fight with him. Why? You won't believe this, how can I say this... Speak up Saber Effendi. He thinks that someone from here has opened the dam and flooded the village. And he accused me of knowing about it, he means that I'm an accomplice. How can he say this?! I told him: say who opened the dam and he said nothing, I told him that I will not forgive this. - And you fought in front of the people? - Yes, but no one understood why. You are wrong Saber Effendi, don't forget the disaster has effected the sheikh. After we come back from the bank we will talk. - Wait for me Saber Effendi. - Of course, sir. I will join you in a minute. - God bless you sir Did you understand? - Yes. - But what can you do? - Listen, they had a big fight. Saber threatened him in front of the people. This means he'll seek revenge. What if we kill the sheikh tonight? Are you crazy? But how? - I'll steal the rifle of Saber Effendi. - And? And leave the rest to me. - Hello. - Welcome Hassan. - Where's Ahmed Effendi? He must be at the mountain with Saleem. Are you alone here? - Will you pray with me, Hassan? - You are saying your prayer here? Yes, come join me. Hassan, I said come to pray with me. - But the mosque isn't far, why not go there, it's better. - You're right. - Is the sheikh there? - Yes I saw him on my way here. I will pray with him and afterwards I will apologize to him. Why? Are you still not talking? No it's all ended, if I didn't travel with Riad bay I would have gone to him. I'll change my clothes, or better put on a cape. No, no stay I'll bring it to you. What are you doing, Hassan, can't you find it? I'll close the window, there's some wind. Let me do it, the lock is tricky. Let's hurry to go to the group prayer. Hurry up, Hassan, we may miss the group prayer. You go, I will leave you now. I have to go home to prepare my luggage. I'm traveling early in the morning. - I wish you a nice trip, Salam Alikum. - Alikum Salam. - Are you sure he didn't see you? - He can hardly see under his feet. Catch him. It's the one who shot him. - Come, hurry, come! - What? They killed the sheikh. - My Pasha, my Pasha! - What happened, Saber Effendi? - Sheikh Abdul Samad was shot. - Is he dead? I don't know. Will you allow me to call the police station? They should send a doctor. Tell me Saber Effendi, don't they know who shot him? I don't know, but he won't escape. Operator, hello... If people catch him they'll tear him to pieces. - Does no one know who is he? - Don't worry, he'll be caught by now. - Riad. - I placed the money in the safe. Come Riad, listen to the sad news, the terrible news. - What happened? Sheikh Abdul Samad has been shot. - Impossible! - It's true Riad Bay. Hello, hello. Can you believe this, Riad? How can anybody do this? What's happening to the world? The criminal shot him on his way to prayers. I wish I'd caught him. - You ran after him? - Yes but the bastard escaped me. - Too bad. - Don't worry he will... Hello? The station, yes there's a murder here. What? You already know? Alright. Dad, what happened? - Don't worry, darling, - My Pasha, the whole village is outside. The killer must have come here and they saw him. - Killer? Who was killed? - Sheikh Abdul Samad. - The criminal must be here. - Riad, - Go and see what they want. - Me?! - They killed the sheikh?! - You'd better go to your room. I want to know who killed him, who? - Saber Effendi, my Pasha. - Saber Effendi?! - He'd better come out now. - What you're saying is unbelievable. It's true he had a fight with the sheikh and threatened him in front of Saleem, - But he wouldn't kill him. - He killed him! - His gun and his cape are there. - And I saw him running to your palace. That's why he came scared and trembling. Oh my god, who would believe such a man could do this. If he doesn't come out we will go in and get him We do respect you. But nothing will stop us. Alright, calm down, I will handle this. If you don't throw him out we'll go in. - What dad, they found him? - Know who killed sheikh Abdul Samad? - Who? - Saber Effendi - Me? - Impossible, dad. They must be wrong. - Someone saw him do it. - Why didn't they catch him? - He ran. - I ran after the killer. - And your cape? - My cape, I lost it while running. - And your rifle? - What about it? - They found his rifle? - Yes, at the scene of the crime. - Impossible dad, this can't be. Enough, Amal, I don't know what to do. We told you to apologize to the sheikh, - How can you kill him? - You put me in a difficult situation. Why did you come to hide here, why not elsewhere? What can I do now if I hand you to the peasants... No uncle they'll kill him. I can't hand them the man who's served me for 30 years. - Uncle, give him a chance to escape. - How can I escape? - It's the only chance to save yourself. - But I didn't kill him. - I will talk to them. - No. Let me talk to them, I know what to tell them. Let him. It's impossible that I killed the sheikh. I was going to apologize to him. How could I kill him, me? Ahmed! Come, Saber effendi, come. We must find out who stole the rifle. - What, Hamid? - The police. - Where? - On the bridge. - Give me the phone - If you ran away like I told you? - There's still time to escape. - No, my father will not escape. - Ahmed! - If he escapes he will be considered guilty. - Saber, don't waste the chance. - What chance?! The palace surrounded. - Where can he escape to? - Then what to do now? - He should surrender to the police. - But Ahmed... It will be the same. No, justice will be done and they will find the real criminal. - Give me the station. - The sheriff is here. - Excuse me Pasha, handcuff him. - Yes sir. - Be brave, Ahmed. - Riad, call my lawyer to be with him, my personal lawyer. Thank you my Pasha. Don't worry, Saber Effendi, you will be out soon. You won't escape us, Saber. Thank you, my Pasha. But I accept no condolences until I take my revenge. A life for a life and my father worth 2 lives. - I pity Saber. - Yes indeed. He killed who? Sheikh Abdul Samad. His old friend who used to consider him a soul brother, saying their prayers together. There's a person who stole the rifle and killed the victim, at the same time my client was going to the sheikh to pray with him and apologize to him. What is he saying? I don't believe this. And why did the criminal choose Saber Effendi's rifle? He must have known about the argument they had. The court needs solid proof, anything to back you up. I only have Hassan's testament. Your honor, 3 months has passed and they couldn't bring the said witness. The witness left the morning after the crime and hasn't return yet. And it's possible he will never return? Maybe he is dead? Your honor, I ask for more time. - Hassan is here, my Lady. - Come, come. Ahmed, here's Hassan. Hassan, thank god. The court will reach a verdict today, a short break for consultation. Hassan is here. Swear to tell the truth. - What's your name? - Hassan Hassan. - I don't know how to thank you. - Thank god that Hassan is here now. - Don't worry Saber, it will be over. - Thank you my lady, god bless you. - Do you know the defendant? - Yes, indeed. You were at his home the night of the crime? The night the sheikh got killed, Yes. What were you doing there? - Answer Hassan. - I was... visiting. - Do you usually visit him? - Yes, he gives me something to eat, or I borrow some money. The truth, Saber Effendi is a noble man. They say he is noble! - And what happened that day? - I found him very angry. And I asked what's wrong, Saber Effendi. Please sir, I don't want to testify. Come back here. This is a court of law, bring him back. Continue. I asked him, what's wrong Saber Effendi, why are you angry? Just a small argument with the Sheikh. When I said the word Sheikh he got mad and started swearing at him. - At Sheikh Abdul Samad? - Yes. No your honor, Hassan is lying. - Wait Saber. - Your honor, he is lying, I was... Don't say another word. Continue Hassan. I tried to calm him down, but it was no use. I said that the sheikh is a good man. But he grabbed his rifle and went out. I said, where you going? The sheikh is a good man, have you gone crazy? He said, I'll seek revenge and restore my dignity. - I will kill the sheikh. - He's lying, lying. If you interrupt again I will put you out. Please Ahmed, wait. I grabbed his cloth, please. Saber Effendi, please. Then he calmed down and he said: go home Hassan, leave me alone. - And where did you go when you left him? - Yes... After I went out I was worried, I stood in the dark watching him. After a while I saw him go out, wearing his cape and... holding his rosary, walking towards the mosque. - Didn't you see a rifle in his hand? - No sir, I didn't see, why should I lie. - He didn't see you when he went out? - I was hiding, then I went home. As soon as I got home I said I was so stupid, maybe he was hiding the rifle under his cape. His rosary was in one hand and the other hand was on his chest. I ran to catch him but on my way I heard the people crying Saber Effendi killed the sheikh! Liar, liar! Come on, calm down. The criminal set it up with Hassan to say this. - Ahmed. - My father is innocent - I'm losing my mind. There's no hope. The court is ready. The verdict of this court is that the defendant be sentenced to capital punishment. Ahmed. This in injustice, injustice. It's god's will, Ahmed. My father never hurt anyone, he says his prayers, gives to charity. - He was never away from god, why god... - Please Ahmed don't blaspheme. He gave Hassan food and shelter. And when my father counted on him to testify the truth - he ended up condemned to death. - Ahmed. - Please leave me alone. - I can't leave you. - Ahmed you must go, leave right now. - Leave my father between life and death? You tried all you can, the people want revenge. They want to kill you, did you forgot Saleem? I know they've all left me now, I have no one. - Don't say this. - My life is worth nothing now, I only care about saving my father, I must know who killed the Sheikh. - Dad. - Amal! I expected to find you here, it's our duty to stand beside him. Please sit down. Be brave, Ahmed. Listen son, your father served me with devotion for over 30 years. And to acknowledge his devotion I'm ready to give you any money you need, a thousand, two, more. But I want you to go away. Don't stay in the village another minute. - My Pasha... - You must understand your situation is critical and mine too. I know that just visiting me can make the villagers hate you, but... Ahmed! I'm now like a father to you and must protect you. Is it right to go, leaving my father to hang, and the criminal unpunished? - You can leave this to dad. - No, me, it's me who will look for him. I won't rest until I hand the criminal to the authorities. We can't tolerate injustice. - No one can reveal the secret but Hassan. - Hassan will fall in our hands eventually. No Hassan must fall into my hands. Saleem won't give you a chance. Ahmed, go and save yourself. Impossible, if you think that I'm naive and peaceful like my father, you must know that until I find the criminal my heart will have no feelings and no mercy. I will work with Saleem to discover the real criminal. - Listen son, I'm... - My Pasha, I truly thank you. Riad Bay, if I need you I will come to the palace. Thank you very much, my Lady. Ahmed is right, Hassan is the only one who can save his father. And who knows the criminal. - He must be hidden until the execution. - Of course. Riad Bay, I'm scared. Why, what is this place? No, no. - Take this. - You want more? - Yes. I may get hungry and go buy a goose. - Where will you go? - I'm staying here. Riad bay, please tell me why you killed the Sheikh. - Who killed the Sheikh? - Saber Effendi. What's the news? - Where's Saleem? - Saleem! Let him cry for his father a little more, when the village sleeps, I will kill him. Saleem you are now the head of the family, we don't want to lose you for this boy, let me kill him. If Saber had 10 sons, killing them won't be enough for the Sheikh. - It's me. - It's me who will kill him. No one will kill him but me! And if anyone dares to do it, he will be my enemy. Nafe, come boy. Bring me my rifle. Salam Alikum. I came for you Saleem. I came to your home. Answer me, Saleem. Answer your friend and brother. You are right to hate me. You are right wanting to kill me. But for our friendship and to have a clear conscience in front of god you must be sure first. Must know what is right and what wrong. My father didn't kill the Sheikh. Hassan lied in front of god. Understand me, all of you, understand I'm not here to beg you, I'm not a coward. All I ask is two days, until I find Hassan and know the truth from him. Why the silence? Saleem, I want you to understand this. You will kill me and the court will send you to death. Like your father is gone, my father will be wasted, also me and you we're all victims of the criminal you don't want to know. We will leave him to think of us like dead dogs, Saleem. Put your hand in mine and we'll search for the killer. Answer me Saleem. Say one word then shoot me. I'm standing and ready for death. Shoot Saleem, shoot. This is the last visit, tomorrow at 8 o'clock. - Does he know? - Don't tell him. - Here comes the groom. - Where are they taking him? To the wedding bed. Dad... I searched for Hassan, I went to every town he used to go to. Don't bother son, he won't appear again until I'm gone. When Ahmed? Tomorrow? Ahmed, I'm an old man, I've had enough of this world. God's given me everything I wanted, I raised you and saw you a man. It's me who handed you in, I thought there was justice. The law is just, my son, it's the people who are unjust. The judge has followed god's laws and god's will. It's true I hoped the court would prove my innocence. Not because I want to live, No, just to stay in people's minds as an honest man and you can be proud of me forever. You won't die, I will find Hassan. Go away son, leave the village, Saleem won't leave you alone. - Impossible, impossible. - Please son, I beg you, Don't go back there, let me live my last few hours in peace of mind. Don't cry Ahmed, you are a man. Tomorrow when I die, I want to feel you are safe. Promise me Ahmed, promise me, my son. The visit has ended. Good bye Ahmed, may god be with you. Thank you for the goose, bye. - You testified the truth, Hassan. - I'm afraid of no one. - Didn't you know? Saber will be hanged. - I wish they'd hang Ahmed too. We'll die together Hassan, welcome back. - So much money, who paid you to testify against my father. - I told the truth. - You're a liar. And a coward. - God forgive you. Who gave you the money? If you tell me I'll give you 50 pounds. Let go of me first. That's him! - Uncle Ahmed, leave. Saleem's coming. - You go. - Didn't you see Ahmed? - No. Here, but in it's place. - Why did Hassan go to the market? - He went to buy a goose. - You gave him money? - Those were your orders. I said after Saber was hanged, he couldn't wait another day? - He's going back to the tomb. - And what if Ahmed finds him? Riad... - Why not get rid of Hassan tonight? - You mean kill him? - Why not? - As you wish, uncle. - But... - But what? I'm afraid. Maybe you can help me in this one. - Me? - Yes, is it only me who has to kill? - What's happening to you Riad - My conscience has started to hurt. - Nonsense! - It's my conscience, uncle. No it's not your conscience, you want money. This year you must travel to Europe and have some fun, how much do you want? - Who's taking about money, uncle. - What is it you want? Anyway I won't deny you anything you want, play. - One condition, you must kill Hassan tonight. - OK. So, what is it you want? Uncle, I want to marry Amal. - Congratulations, uncle. - Are you serious? - Of course. - Did you think before speaking? Not really, I was thinking about the flooded village, the Sheikh, Saber Effendi and Hassan... My only daughter, a price for what you did? Without what I did, I'm her cousin, and I'm young and a handsome man. - You are a lowlife criminal. - No please, Pasha, - How can you say that to your son-in-law? - Get out of here! - And kill Hassan? - Are you threatening me? It's not me threatening you, it's Saleem, Ahmed and all the villagers. Not only those, the court, will you tell me go and kill the judge? - You will be doomed like me - Why not? What's life without Amal? - You mean you love her? - I adore her. - You! - Yes me, you mean because... This is another matter, come on uncle. - Riad, I will give you 10,000 pounds. - Even if you give me all your money. - You want to marry her for my money. - No I swear. Riad, try to understand my feelings, Amal for me is… I just can't. - I can't give her to someone I know is... - Is what, my Pasha? You too “are...” - What d'you want? - I get rid of Hassan tonight and the wedding tomorrow. - Alright. - Then we have an agreement, uncle? Who is it? Can I sit down? Please. - What are you doing? - Having a walk! - Congratulations. - Thanks, for what? I told uncle I want to marry you. When he agreed, I ran to tell you. - And dad agreed? - He was so happy and insisted the wedding be tomorrow. - You must be drunk. - With happiness. - I'm sure you're drunk. - Drunk with love. Get away, are you crazy? I'll tell dad. - OmAlahana. - What? - Celebrate. - Why? - Just do it. - Tomorrow I'll marry Amal. - You! God damned bastard. - What? Dad you must do something about Riad. Send him away, right this minute. - What happened, darling? - He came to my room while drunk. - Drunk? - The devil wanted to kiss me. He was hallucinating that we're engaged and are marrying tomorrow. - Just calm down, Amal. - He can't stay here, do something now. He wasn't lying, darling. - Because I... - Because what, dad? - It's true he asked to marry you. - And you agreed? - Just wait. - For what? - To get married to him? - Why not, he's your cousin. - Impossible, I can't believe it. - Listen! Listen to what? I won't marry Riad. Leave her alone now. - Hassan! - I'm going. - Don't let anyone see you. - Don't worry. Hassan, Hassan! Hassan went to his home, I saw him just now. Thanks, go home. - This time you won't escape. - Please, I had nothing to do with it. - Forgive me, it's not my fault. - My father will be hanged tomorrow. - I beg you. - Do you hear me? Tomorrow! Speak up! I will kill you, tell me who! Riad, Riad Bay. - He who stole the rifle? - I don't know, I don't know. I beg you, I beg you. - Was it Riad, Riad who stole the rifle? - Yes, it's him, it's him. Stand up. Where are you taking me? - You will say this to the police. - Riad Bay will kill me, Ahmed, - Please don't, Riad Bay will kill me. - Like he killed the Sheikh? - I don't know, I didn't see. I didn't see him - Move! Ahmed! - Who are you? - Ahmed. - Why you sitting here, Ahmed? - I needed some fresh air. - It's dangerous for you to be out at night. - Yes. Sergeant Mohamed, accompany him to his home. How are you, Saber? Come. Ahmed didn't come. - Prisoner Saber Aboul Salam, sir. - Ready, sir. The court orders for case 658, for the year 51, against the criminal Saber AboulSalam. He was sent to be executed by hanging for committing the crime of murdering Sheikh Abdul Samad Almeniawi, on 23 September 1951. And the order is to be carried out. Ahmed, you never dreamed of being the hero of the village. You brought happiness to us and wealth to our home. May god bless you. May god make this year pass peacefully, Saber Effendi. The defendant asked for a retrial, but the court refused. The time of the execution was set for 8 AM. Do you have a last wish, Saber? I testify that there's no god but Allah and Mohamed is his messenger. Uncle, uncle... I have important news. Saleem shot Ahmed and killed him. You will sleep well tonight, as for me... Amal ran away. Do you hear me? Amal ran away. Ahmed! Hello, yes, yes, OK thanks. - Is she at Ahmed's? - Saleem's standing guard, she can't be there. - Where can she be, tell me? - My Pasha... - What? - We searched everywhere, sir. - She must have jumped into the Nile. - Calm down. Where can she be? My father will be hanged... They will hang him. Ahmed... Saleem, Saleem. Where's Saleem I must see him now. I must go to the police, - I know the killer. - Ahmed! - I'm not hallucinating? - Don't move or you'll bleed again. - Leave me, my father will die. - It's over. And you wanted me to leave, wanted Riad to look for the criminal. - To look for himself! - Your father has died. Hassan told me everything, Riad stole the rifle and he killed the Sheikh. My father died? Died! Ahmed, talk to me. - Answer me. - Leave me alone. I can never leave you. - Forget everything. How can I forget that I love you. When you declare love, my heart is full of hate, - Earlier I wished... - Ahmed. If you really love me let me revenge on your cousin and when I hand Riad to justice I will be all yours, body and soul. - I will go tell Saleem that Riad is the killer. - Amal... Are you afraid for me? Saleem won't believe you, it's not your fault, don't take risks. My fault is that Riad is my cousin. - Saleem. - Ahmed, you must go hide at the temple. - Hide? - Yes I will go home and explain everything to my dad. - He'll report Riad to the police. - Report his nephew? You don't know dad, Ahmed, please go to the window. I'll distract Saleem from here. - Can you walk? - Yes. I'll be back soon. Welcome back. Dad isn't here, they're all out looking for you. What happened to you? I'm sorry my love wasn't so important to marry today, why not tomorrow. Or marry in Cairo? Go change and we'll travel right away. - Leave me alone. - Amal, Amal. Amal, you're angry with me. - Did Ahmed... - He died, Ahmed died. Oh that's sad, he was a nice guy. He died too young. But how do you know? - Hassan told me. - Hassan? - Where did you see Hassan? - I was at his place. - And why did you go there? - I wanted to know who stole the rifle. And did he tell you? - He refused to say anything. - Did you offer him money? - 50 pounds - And he took it? -Yes. - Then he must have confessed. - Confessed what? - I mean... - Is he at home now? - No. - Left? - I don't know, what's the matter? He must have left. Do you know who killed Sheikh AbdoulSamad? - Who? - Ahmed. He took his father's rifle and killed the Sheikh. - Liar, you killed him. - Then you know. - I know everything. - And you sent Hassan to report it? - Yes. - Better you confess. - All this for Ahmed? You report me? Your cousin! Dad, you must call the police right now. Welcome back Pasha, what are you waiting for? Call the police. Tell them the criminal is here. Riad, Amal doesn't understand anything, she's too young. - You don't want to call them, I will. - Riad! Too young, you say too young, - What she was doing spending last night with Ahmed? - Riad shut up, you're drunk. - He's the one who killed the Sheikh. - And tell us why I killed the Sheikh. - Riad, please. - Will you tell her or should I call the police? - Later, I will tell her later. - Dad, you knew? I don't know anything at all. How not know? Didn't you tell me to flood the land? Told me: kill the Sheikh, kill Hassan, then you can marry my daughter? Or am I wrong, now she knows everything, she knows from Hassan. Hassan? Hassan died, hit by a train! Hassan died? She fooled me? Congratulations uncle, congratulations! Amal answer me, answer your father. - Understand, there are circumstances forced me to... - Steal? Loot? Kill? If you were poor I'd maybe believe you, but you are so rich, rich, rich! - All that I did was for you. - Don't say for me. - Believe me. - How can I believe you. All my life I was lied to and fooled If could do more I would have done so, to guarantee you happiness, now and after I'm gone. I must keep for you the wealth I got from my father and grandfather. And increase it, so we live, masters forever. Masters? We will die and become dust and those peasants you enslave will step on us. You are a criminal, everything is gone gone. - Never, all will be back to normal, I'll fix everything. - Shut up! - Please forgive me. - I wish I could, - I wish god could forgive you. - What can I do? You can't bring back the peasants cane nor Sheikh Abdoul Samad. Nor Saber Effendi and Ahmed. - I'm ready to... - Go to Saleem and tell him the truth. You know what this means. It means that Ahmed will live even without me. Saleem, come, Saleem is here. - Dad, like I told you. - Move away. Where you going? Go back to your room, if you talk you know what will happen. Come. Pull yourself together and watch your words. Come. Come. - Your daughter spent the night with Ahmed at his home. - How come? I could have killed them both, but I said: it's your honor my Pasha and you should deal with it. - Listen Saleem... - What can you say, it's a scandal... - Riad! - Let me kill her. Before you kill her I want to know where she's hidden Ahmed. - Didn't he die? - The lady got him out at dawn. Bring her here, my Pasha. Saleem, for the Pasha's sake we don't want a scandal. You go now and I will know from her and come to you. I must know now, I must kill Ahmed before nightfall. - Ahmed is innocent, innocent. - How dare you still talk and defend him? - It was you who killed the Sheikh, you. - Shut up! You want to sacrifice your family for your lover. Saleem! The Pasha's daughter is our enemy, she is a whore, look for Ahmed before nightfall. You must find him and no one dares to hurt him, Bring him to me at home. Go tell her to pack her things, we will leave now. Why don't you move, what are you waiting for? Waiting for her to call the police? I'll kill her. Amal! You knew she would run, you're both against me. She won't call the police, she'll run with Ahmed. It's over. Amal is no longer for us, she belongs to Ahmed now - Let me go! - If you follow her I'll call the police. I'll confess everything. Amal, thank god, I was so afraid for you. I was afraid you wouldn't come back. I wanted to go looking for you. I would die just to see you. Your father must have been in shock when he knew it was Riad, right? - Leave Ahmed, go away. - Go away? - Yes, right now. - Why? Did you tell your father? He didn't believe you? Ahmed… Of course he didn't believe you. Ahmed it's no use talking, now you must run away. - Run, Ahmed. - But you promised me you'd tell your father. I did all I could, I came now to warn you about Riad and Saleem, both are looking for you. They want to kill you, run, Ahmed, - I can come with you. - What are you saying? What have Saleem and Riad got to do with it? - Answer me, didn't you tell your father? - Ahmed, don't torture me. Are you hiding something? Your father knows Riad is the killer? Your father knows? Your father? I felt it all along, but didn't want to believe it. I couldn't believe it, how can a man be so cruel? God gave him money and wealth but took away kindness from his heart. He became a savage beast. He flooded the land and stole and killed. He killed my father, my father! And you want me to run, and you run with me. Get lost, I don't want to see you. Get out of here! Get lost! Get out of here! Amal! You stay here. Criminal, criminal, criminal! Don't move! I said don't move. Leave it to me, Riad Bay, it's my revenge. Saleem, kill me too Saleem, kill me. Shame on you Ahmed, hiding behind a woman. Saleem! Kill them both, shoot, Saleem. Don't move. Catch him. Saleem, I deserve... all that happens to me, because I was unjust. Riad is the killer. We planned it together and the devil possessed us. - Wait, I will explain. - Riad Bay, we will do justice. You killed my father and his and we must kill you. You kill him,.. What, you want to hand him to the court? It's not enough to be hung 4 times, but we shouldn't be jailed for a dog like him. Subtitles: wildhorse, corvusalbus
