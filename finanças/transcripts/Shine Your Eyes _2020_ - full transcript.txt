Aneke the bird said that Since men learned to shoot without missing It learned to fly without perching Aneke the bird said that Since men learned to shoot without missing It learned to fly without perching Imagine my mouth here. I need your imagination for this one. This is the face of your Chi. Excuse me, sir. I'm looking for Galeria Presidente... I'm looking for this... Galeria Presidente? Galeria Presidente? Uncle! I see you turned out looking like your brother. -I hope all is well? -I'll take you home now. -How's everybody at home? -All good, good. The mall is closed, but I've waited for you. Amadi, my darling, how do I do this? I am not very good with technology. No problem, Mom. Bring it closer to your mouth and say what you want to say. Amadi, my son, can you please wait outside? I want to talk to your brother alone. Of course, Mom. Call me if you need my help. I'll be waiting outside. Ikenna, my love. My first son. My heart. We're not open yet. You can't come in. No, I don't know him. I don't know him. Hey, you can't-- I'm going to kill him! I'm coming, you bastard... -Let's close the deal at 30%, Mr. Ogboh. -No, Emilia. If a customer likes it here, I'll recommend it. No, Emilia. I won't get anything out of it. -30% -It's not enough. 35% then. 35%, and I'll tell them to come and have their nails done with Anne Marie. 35%, Mr. Ogboh, and Anne Marie will do their nails. All right. Thank you, Mr. Ogboh. She negotiates like an Igbo. When you go back home and meet your girlfriend, she will be wearing my Brazilian hair. Can you feel the money? You could work here with me… Uncle, I don't think I will stay here for long. The mall is down there, where we were. We are... so close... but so far away. This could very well be London. White people city. I can't explain what brought Ikenna to São Paulo. But I felt like I had to help him. I can't help but support him, it's always been like this. He lied, just... to make us happy. And were you people happy? Chima said Ikenna lost a lot of money on video games and horse races. Something called him to São Paulo. He was talking about building an instrument that only Igbos would understand, because of Chukwu. So confusing. Because Chukwu has the musical score for uwa. Ikenna used to play at my great-grandfather's house. There were four cannons, he had talismans, relics. Witchcraft… Did anyone tell you about my Igbo-Agu? Nobody could tell my ancestor. They called a priest to throw the cowrie shells. First time, second time, third time... nothing. Later, the Priest said, “Ikenna is your ancestor.” He said Ikenna had been reincarnated in me. Since then, I haven't believed in anything. Go for number five. The deal was to give you number five, don’t chicken out now. ...his owner has a good one... ...there's a great shortcut to Schopenhauer, which is a product that has run twice, didn't start well the first time, but according to... ...a good head, and could perhaps play a trick here on his opponents. The animals in race number four are already going for the big start... Which one is yours? The competitors are down for the first part of the big turn and Extremista... ...in fifth, as Coronel Rubino, running inside, goes in third. Schopenhauer is open... Come on! ...the scoreboard. In the first place comes Schopenhauer... In second, Coronel Rubino, and in third, Extremista. There it is, the horse doesn't pay... ...he came from Rio Grande do Sul with a good entourage, trusting in Schopenhauer, that comes out victorious in this endeavor and his product can already run in classic races... Should I eat it? Very good. Very good. No, no, no. Carry on. Since men learned to shoot without missing... Since men learned to shoot without missing... It learned to fly... It learned to fly without perching. No. no. It's your turn now. It's your turn now... No, no! It's your turn now. Aneke the bird... Aneke the bird said that Since men learned to shoot without missing It learned to fly without perching Anne Marie. Please take Amadi upstairs, and don't charge him, okay? Can you believe, Emilia? A woman who's not even family yet is telling me what to wear. She told me that I could wear any color, except yellow. Really? Because my son's mother-in-law is going to wear yellow. That's tough, Mrs. Vania. What's your name? My name is Emilia. What's the matter? What are you looking at? Li Wei! Help me out here. He speaks English, I don't understand. What does he want? So inconvenient! He wants to know who scribbled this, madam. How would I know who wrote that? Wasn't it that weird customer who scribbles numbers on everything? Who? It seems like his name is Fernando. Fernando? I don't know who Fernando is. You've spoken enough English already. Lumumbeats Nightclub, google it. I told you to go back. -Do you want to lose your job? -Ok. Thank you, sir. Farewell. What? Yes, that's me. What? What happened to you? Nothing. Sorry, did I wake you up? What happened? Ikenna happened. Or should I say, Charlie happened? Did you find him? No, but I found out a lot about him. His name is Charlie, did you know? Selfish bastard. It's all about him, always about him. Did you know he has a fiancée back home? They've been engaged for five years! Five years! She hasn't heard from him in over a year. She's there, waiting for him to come home. The embarrassment this has caused our mother... She lives in constant fear of running into his fiancée's parents in public. But at least she exists for him. What fools we are. He's lost, Amadi. Too much expectation, it can break a man. It could happen to any of us. The pressure put on the first son... I'm not defending him. But your family expected so much from him. Some of us manage to take it in, absorb it. But for others, like Ikenna... it's too much. He didn't ask you to come here. That was your choice. -I didn't choose-- -But here you are. What I'm telling you is this: Ikenna is carrying his own burden, and you've put yours on him too. Even if you believed the bullshit that he somehow was reincarnated in you, wouldn't you still have your free will? Amadi, my son, can you please wait outside? I want to talk to your brother alone. Of course, Mom. Call me if you need my help. I'll be waiting outside. Ikenna, my love. My first son. My heart-- Ikenna, my love-- -Ikenna, my love... -Aneke... She's the only one who can handle that. She's here on Wednesday and Friday mornings. That’s how it is here at the Immigrant House. No shower in the morning. Showers are only in the afternoon, never in the morning. Because every day you have to leave and look for work, do something, maybe get yourself an ID or whatever. We can't do that for you. Human hair has different shades: India, Brazil, Europe, Russia… It’s confusing, since Russia is in Europe. Now I'll go collect Uche’s money. When I come back, I’ll check your work. Tomorrow... Please, okay? This one here… It's the other way round. And this one... Just so you know… Dad... Time for bed. What are you doing here? Is everything okay with Mr. Ogboh? Did something happen? What are you doing here? It's quite late. I don't understand you. I don't know where he is. I haven't seen him in over a year. Long time. No. This phone is mine. He gave it to me. I mean… He didn't give it to me, but he left it here. Wait... Wait. Ikenna should be looking for Ikenna. Ikenna would have found Ikenna by now… That language of yours is beautiful. I asked your brother to speak it sometimes. It’s funny how he sounded like someone else when he spoke it. You two look similar. He didn't have a beard like yours though. When I was four years old... I asked my mother... “What is this hole on my chin?” I saw this dimple and didn't know what it was. My mother told me... Listen to what my mother said. "When you’re born... you get in line to see God. And if he likes you... he'll say... 'You cute little thing.' And he'll give you dimples there. And if he doesn't like you... he goes, 'Go away.'" You don't understand a word I'm saying, do you? Was this Ikenna's? Yes, it was Ikenna's. Check out that guy. That guy over there. Third floor. Over there. He's always watching the same porn. Nothing wrong with porn, but he could buy a new one. Change it up a bit. You and Ikenna were together? What other foods do you like? Here? Here... here... and here. Do you speak Portuguese? I'm... learning. -You dance? -No. Yes, you do. Just a little. Let's dance then. -Let's dance, c'mon. -No, no... C'mon! Get up, Amadi! Momento... Ocupação Urbana. "Momento"? "Movimento Ocupação Urbana". Hello. CHOOSE YOUR LOADOUT! PREPARE FOR BATTLE! BLUE SUPER-MINIONS HAVE SPAWNED! YOUR TEAM HAS DESTROYED A TURRET! YOU HAVE SLAIN AN ENEMY! Amadi, my darling, how do I do this? I am not very good with technology. No problem, Mom. Bring it closer to your mouth and say what you want to say. Amadi, my son, can you please wait outside? I want to talk to your brother alone. Of course, Mom. Call me if you need my help. I'll be waiting outside. Ikenna, my love. My first son. My heart. I miss you. I need you home, by my side. Nobody can take your place. I've had lots of children, thank God... but he chose you to be the first. And these are sad days when we don’t know where you are. Since the death of your father, our home is without a head. You're not going to understand a thing. There’s this story in my family… about when my great-grandmother... converted to Christianity. The family was outraged. How could the wife of a great king abandon our tradition and follow the white man's church? They tolerated her, though. She was mostly left alone. Until the day she appeared in a long white dress, given to her by an Anglican priest to hide her nakedness. She was the first person to wear a dress in Awka. People gathered and gave her the beating of her life. Enraged, my great-grandfather said he'd curse his own wife... and all who came out of her womb. But nothing happened to us. Five, five... Nine, one, six... Five, five... Five. Have you seen my phone? My phone, have you seen it? You don't speak English, do you? I don't suppose you speak Igbo either. How do you communicate then? I enjoy his company. Destroy the plans That I’ve once made for myself Makes me wonder why life is like this I always go back and forth to your arms You don't really want me Deep inside I’m your vanity I’m always following your steps Maybe that’s why you came to Brazil. I always get stuck in those ties -I don't know... -So who is she singing to? I don't know anything about that. You just call me and I’ll go Why don’t you go away for good? Why don’t you set me free From that passion? Why don't you say You don't want me anymore? Why don’t you set my heart free? But you need to tie me up You need to seduce me! Just so as I’m crazy about you Just to have someone Who is always at your disposal For a second of love But you need to tie me up Do you remember when I taught you to see your own chi? My brother. Is it coming back to you? It was a long time ago. Right there, I saw that our family curse lived in you. Remember our great-grandmother's beating? She cried loudly against the world, and against you. The universe is against you. Ikenna was here, Emilia. Do you hear what I'm telling you? Ikenna was here. I don't know. I don't know! -Who took the electric guitar from here? -Don't yell at me. -He was here, he was here again. -Don't yell. Ikenna was here. He is in this city, São Paulo. I’ve run up and down. The more I search for him... the more he disappears. I can't do anything. Ikenna could do everything. Come out, brother, let people see you! Ikenna was here, is here. I don't know what you're trying to say. He was here. -I can't understand you. -He was here. It's your turn now! Go ahead and say it... EMERGENCY EXIT The priest was right. I am within you. I did reincarnate in you. I am deep inside you. And now I understand why. I have you in my body. This marks the place where the story ended. I've been with you all along. My ofo na alo. About you and Emilia. I found a way to avoid the curse, to save you. Imagine my mouth here. I need your imagination for this one. This is the face of your Chi. I can also play it like this. Or change it to this. Let's sing. Like in the old times. The song I taught you. Aneke the bird said that Since men learned to shoot without missing Aneke the bird said that Since men learned to shoot without missing Aneke the bird said that Since men learned to shoot without missing Aneke the bird said that Since men learned to shoot without missing Aneke the bird said that Since men learned to shoot without missing Aneke the bird said that Since men learned to shoot without missing It learned to fly without perching Aneke the bird said that Since men learned to shoot without missing It learned to fly without perching Aneke the bird said that Since men learned to shoot without missing It learned to fly without perching Aneke the bird said that Since men learned to shoot without missing It learned to fly without perching Aneke the bird said that Since men learned to shoot without missing Did you predict this, brother? Can you change this? Answer me! Brother. You're going home. Mom... Ikenna will be coming back to you. He will not be able to take care of you. He won’t be the head of the family. He will still be... your first son. He will still be your heart. He will still be your beautiful boy. And he will be carrying this message that I recorded for you. Mom... How can I explain this to you in a way you'll understand? It’s as if when the cowrie shells were cast during my Igbo-Agu, there was a bird, high in the sky. With one eye, he was looking at the result of the shells. With his other eye, he was looking somewhere far, an invisible city on the other side of the ocean. And now, I am here... looking for the place his eye marked... looking for something I can grasp, a tiny crack I can slip through. Alone. For the first time in my life, truly alone. It’s morning. And it’s raining very softly. Mom. Wish me luck.
