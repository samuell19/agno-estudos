You stupid fucking bitch! When I tell you to bring me a beer, I want a fucking cold one. Expect me to drink this piss warm shite? Sorry. Well, sorry ain't gonna get me another fucking beer, is it? What's the matter with you? Nothing, everything's fine. You need to sort your shit out, Peaches, and fast. You what? I wait on you hand and foot while you just sit there. If it wasn't for me, you'd still be up Legends Nightclub every night with your knickers around your ankles. At least I'd be happy, and not stuck here in this hell hole with you. Happy, is that what you call it? A pole between your flaps and a fanny full of spunk up Dog-Shit Alley. Well, at least I was getting some back then which is more than I can say now, you fucking fat waste of space! What'd you fucking say to me, girl? You heard me. It's fucking Candy making you talk like this, isn't it? You leave her out of this, she's got nothing to do with it. She's fucking trouble, that whore. Don't you talk about her like that. I'll talk about a washed-up, tuppeny whore however the fuck I like. Now you get me a cold one before you feel the back of my hand again. You don't scare me anymore. Oh, is that a fact? You're a cowardly fuck, do you know that? Nothing's gonna make up for that pathetic excuse of a pecker you've got in your pants. You fucking bitch! Why don't you sign up to one of those online dating sites? Yeah, I've heard about 'em. What, they actually work, do they? Yeah, I think so. Maggie's sister's kid signed up to one about a month ago and he's met up with three birds already. I think he's fucked one of 'em, and all. Yeah, well I'm not after that, am I? Besides, I can get that whenever I want down at fucking Lenny's. I know, I'm just saying it's out there if you needed it. What I need, Eddie, is someone that understands me. Yeah, well that's not that easy to find in our line of work, Sul, eh? Why's that? Well, it's hardly a good icebreaker is it? What do you do? Oh, I beat the fuck out of people and occasionally kill 'em if I have to. Doesn't get you off to a good start, does it? You found Maggie. Yeah, well, I'm lucky I guess. We've been together since school, ain't we. Besides, you're talking about meeting new people, mate, people who don't have a fucking clue what business we're in. Well, maybe I'm in the wrong business. Not thinking of jacking it in, are you, Sul? Nah, I don't know nothing else, do I? It just does my fucking head in. I mean you got Benny, Al, Larry. Even Jonny's got little Marie. Yeah, Jonny's gay, Sul. You what? Yeah, bent as a nine bob note, mate. I thought you knew that. I don't know that, do I? How the fuck am I meant to know that? Sorry, mate, I thought it was common knowledge. Why are you getting so touchy about it? Is there something you're not telling me? Oh Eddie, fuck off. What are you on about? You know what, this could be the answer to all your problems. Maybe you and him... Eddie, shut up! I'm serious, mate, I could have a word for you. Yeah, and I'm being fucking serious. You're starting to fucking piss me off talking shit. Go on, tell me some more about it. What, Jonny? No, you fucking mug, the internet thing! You never learn, do you, Peaches, eh? You never know when to keep your fucking trap shut! Please, Lionel. You push me and you push me. How much more is it gonna take before you learn your fucking lesson? You'll push me too far one of these days, girl, and I'll bury you in that fucking field out there, alive, so you can die slowly thinking about what a disobedient little whore you've been. Now you go and get yourself cleaned up, you dirty little bitch. Hold it together. No! You will not become a victim. Peaches, what are you doing out there? Peaches! Peaches, you get back here you hear me! Peaches! And do you know what that piece of shit said to me? Go on. He said, right, he said, "If you don't have a tie on, you can't come in." Cheeky little... Yeah, the bloody cheek of it. And by this time, Maggie's got her head in her hands 'cause she can see I'm getting real twitchy. She knows what's gonna happen if he don't shut his noise. But this guy, he obviously ain't got a clue who I am or who I represent. So I try and remain calm, deep breaths, Eddie, deep breaths. Do you know what I said to him? I said... Look out! That's Peaches, isn't it? Wind down the window, Sul. All right, Peaches darling. Bloody hell, what has happened to you? Nothing. Well, it don't look like nothing. Look, I'll be fine. I ain't got time for this. I take it Lionel's home? You know he is. You wouldn't be here else, would ya? Well, do yourself a favor, don't come home for an hour. I don't intend to. What do you think happened to Peaches? Well, that's obvious, isn't it? Lionel's given her a slap. Bastard! Yeah, well, don't let it cloud your judgment. Ready? I'm always ready. Hey, Ed, shall we get the shotguns? They're in the boot. Course not. Last thing we need is a fucking bloodbath. Remember what happened at Little Mo's? Mr. Crooks was not happy. Tell us who it is, Mo. You fucking tell us who it is or I'll blow your fucking brains out. Sully, please, I'm begging you. You see this here you piece of shit! Shit! What the fuck are you doing? Sorry, Eddie. Fucking gun went off in my hand. Dead? Fucking dead? What use to me is he fucking dead? You useless cunts! We're here to talk, remember? Just talk. Look, I know you're afraid. I'm afraid, too. But we have to try to avoid the house of fear. Now, I'm gonna board up the windows and the doors. Oh for fuck's sake. We'll be all right here. We'll be all right here till someone comes to rescue us. But we'll have to work together. You'll have to help. Hello Lionel. Hello Lionel. Sully! Sorry, Ed. Couldn't help myself. Goddammit, girl! What the hell's happened to you? Get your ass inside, come on. He's been at it again, hasn't he? That son of a bitch! What you gonna do about it, Pea? I don't know. This can't keep happening. You, you were better off down Lenny's with me. No one ever laid a finger on you down there. I know. It's just he was all right back then. Yeah, course he was, back then. Back when he was trying to win you over, offering you a better life. Better life, my ass. All you do is run around after him and get knocked about for your troubles. Oh, Pea, I'm sorry. Don't cry. He ain't worth none of your tears. He threatened to kill me this time, Cand. What? Mate, this is getting really serious. Who knows what that fat, sadistic prick is capable of? You need to get out of there and fast. Why can't you come live here with me? How can I? He knows where you live. This is the first place he'd look. Can't bring that round here, I couldn't do it to ya. Then how about move away? Like away, away. This is my home, Cand, long before he was around. Besides, he'd find me wherever I went, I know he would. What, what's funny? Row. It's just something I said while we were arguing. Wound him up a goodun, it did. Told him he had a little dick. Truth hurts, don't it, babe? You're telling me. It's good to see you smiling again, beautiful. You always make me smile. Hey, Cand, remember that time we got stranded down Moe Creak Manor and had to thumb a lift back into town? Oh yeah, that bloke that picked us up stank, didn't he? What was it? Fish heads! Those were the days, eh, Pea? What am I gonna do, Cand? I wish he was fucking dead. Do you mean that? Make things a lot simpler, wouldn't it? Are you serious? 'Cause you shouldn't joke about things like that, Pea. I'm not joking. I really do wish that fucking bastard was dead. Anyway, it's not like it's going to happen, not unless he has a heart attack or something. We could do it. What? You are kidding, right? No, I'm not. Look, just forget I said anything. I'll work something else out. Work out what exactly? Because next time you'll be a slab of meat down the morgue, and he's promised you that. Just forget it, Cand. I can't do something like that. I haven't got it in me. What if we got someone else to do it? Like who? Someone. Where are you going with this? Ta. You sure you don't want one, Li? No. You got any biscuits? I don't know what she fucking buys, do I? All right! How about leveling with us then, Lionel? I've told you the truth already. You were driving the van. Now poor old Woody's looking at five years. Did you not expect to hear from us again? It don't work like that, does it? Look, I panicked. When the van broke down at the traffic lights, I just ran. I had the filth right up my fucking ass. And I've told Jack this already. Yeah, but something don't add up here, now does it? There were 250K when you left and you come back with 200. Now I'm no Alby Einstein, but that does leave us 50K lighter than we should be. I don't know! A bundle must've fallen out the bag or something when I jumped out the van. I was in a bit of a fucking rush, you know? Oh come on, Lionel, you really expect us to believe that shite? Believe what you want, it's the truth. Fucking hell! What the, fucking psycho! Fuck. Fucking... Well, that's a bit gay, isn't it? Tell us where the fucking money is! We know you've fucking hidden it! You tell me where that money is or I'll fucking bite your nose off, you fat, useless cunt! I don't know where it is, I promise. Tell me where the fucking money is! You're lying to me! Sully, please. Sully! Sully! Calm down. Go and get Lionel a towel. Go on. Oh Lionel, sit up. He won't do anything else to you tonight, I promise you that. Well, this is getting us nowhere, is it? Let me tell you a little story, Lionel 'cause I don't think you fully understand the predicament that you're in. Jack Crooks, our boss, our employer, is a reasonable man. But if you choose to abuse his compassionate nature, then things will become... Complicated. No, things don't become complex. They become simple as I will now explain. About a year or so ago, down the nightclub, there was a barman. Nice chap, quiet but hard working. You know the sort, been there for years, long before me or Sully were there. Anyway, his poor old mum got sick and he needed extra money for home care. But instead of telling Jack his situation, he decided to skim the bar-takings of 20 quid a night. Needless to say he was caught and the necessary action was taken. And the action was, Lionel, to burn his fucking house down with him and his mother in it. 500 quid he stole, 500 quid. Now if he can do that to someone for a fucking monkey, think about what he's gonna do to you for 50K. You got one week, Lionel. Bring us the cash we know you've got. Otherwise Sully here won't be gentle like he was tonight and I'll let him off his leash properly. Ruff! Bye, Lionel. Well, that went well. What you looking at me like that for? What did I say before we went in there? Well, he wasn't saying anything, was he? You never gave him a chance. You busted his nose soon as we walked through that door. Yeah, and he still didn't say shit even after all that. Well, at least you didn't kill him. Jack will be pleased about that. What do you take me for, Eddie? It was a bit of gentle persuasion, that's all. And what was all that bullshit about Jack burning down Leo's house for 500 quid? I thought it was a chip pan fire. Yeah, it was, but Lionel ain't to know that, is he? He's got that 50 large stashed somewhere, Sul, I know it. Yeah, I think you're right. He's just not saying anything. He will. For fuck's sake! Fucking machine! Oi, Billy! Fuck off, Reggie. Go on then, what's the problem? Go on, Pea, tell him. My husband, that's the problem. He do that to ya? Yeah. What, often? Yeah, and it's getting worse. He's threatened to kill me now. - And you believe him? - Yeah, I do, he's a... He's an unhinged, booze-swilling madman is what he is, and he's capable of anything. I'm guessing you don't wanna be sticking around to find out exactly what he's capable of. Is that right? No way I'm sticking around to find out but he won't let me leave. That's the situation I'm in. How far are you wanting to go with this? She wants to go all the way. Candy! What? It's the only way, babe. You know it is. You said it yourself. Let her speak for herself, Candy Caine. I don't feel comfortable with this anymore. Well, what the hell did you think we came here for? I don't know what I was thinking. I wasn't thinking clearly, I guess, just desperate. You said we were coming here for advice. But you're talking about murder again now. Yeah, but you said you wanted him dead. Shh! Will you keep your voices down? I know what I said, but I didn't think we were gonna come straight out and plot his fucking demise, did I? Aside from that, what's it gonna cost? I ain't got that sort of money. Whatever it takes, whatever it costs, we'll get it done somehow. Babe, you gotta see this is the only way. Putting me on the spot here, Cand. Well, this is pretty fucking serious, Pea. Do you wanna die? All right, I'll hear what he's gotta say. So Billy-Ray, can you help us out? I don't know about this. You sure you've thought this through, Candy Caine? Yes, we're sure. Well, you don't sound very sure. And she looks like a rabbit trapped in the fucking headlights. Well, so would you, if you'd just had 10 bells of shit kicked out of you. I don't know about this. Billy-Ray, please. No. 'Cause you haven't thought this through properly and she doesn't even wanna be here. We're talking about murdering another human being. Do you understand the baggage that comes with that? Believe me, there won't be any baggage in getting rid of this animal. And you haven't ridden enough cock to be able to afford it. She's already made that clear. You let us worry about that. Just help us out this once and you'll never hear from us again. That's what I'm worried about. Look, you can see what he does to her. Billy, if you don't help us out, you may as well kill her your fucking self 'cause she'll be the one that ends up dead instead of him. Can you live with that? All right. There's this guy I know, bit of an oddball, foreigner. Fancies himself as a gynecologist but that's just a part of his cover. He's more of a problem solver if you know what I mean. Can we meet him? I can put you on to him, but that's as far as I can go. I can't go getting mixed up in anything like this anymore. Got a pen, bit of paper? Peaches. Peaches. Peaches, snap out of it, will ya? Look, I'm sorry about what happened in there, but I'm so scared for your life, I had to do something. It's all right, I know. But what am I meant to do with this, Cand? There's only one thing you can do. Go and see him straight away. What now? Yes, now. I'm not sure about this, Cand. Look, babe, this is your life we're talking about here. And like I said to you earlier, who knows what that evil bastard is capable of. You could wake up dead tomorrow. You know what I mean. Here, let me see that bit of paper. I know where this is. Get in a taxi, we'll be there in 10 minutes. I don't think I can go through with something like this, Cand. Yes, you can. I'll be with you every step of the way. All right. But I'm not going there without ringing him first and you'll have to do that as well. Fine. You and me are in this together, all right? Come on. Yeah? - Is that Dr. - Oldcorn, Dr. Heinrich Oldcorn? Yes, this is he. With whom do I speak at this moment? This is Candy, Candy Caine. Like the sweetie? Yeah, that's right, like the sweet. How may I help you? I hear you solve problems and I've got a giant-sized one. Uh, sounds nasty. My hours of consultancy are between nine a.m. and five p.m. If you would like to make an appointment, I will look at your genitalia first thing in the morning. And may I suggest you sit in a bucket of ice water if the burning gets too much. No, you don't understand. I've got a different problem, one that needs to be got rid of permanently. Oh yes, I understand perfectly. May I ask where you got this number from, Miss Caine? A friend gave it to me. His name is Billy-Ray. I must say, Miss Caine, I find this all rather unorthodox. - Oh Dr. - Oldcorn, please. But as you are acquaintance of Mr. Ray, I will grant an audience with myself. Now, when would you like to schedule this meet? Is tonight convenient? I sense an air of desperation in your cause. Okay, I will accommodate your desire and see you tonight. Oh thank you, thank you so much. It's okay. Am I to understand that you know where my abode is situated? Yeah, we have your address. We? Yeah, my friend Peaches is with me. She's the one with the problem. Okay, okay. Listen to my exact instructions. You will arrive here at precisely 8:25. Use the front door, tapping three sharp times, eh? Tap, tap, tap. Then, after a period of 15 seconds, you will knock again, but this time twice. Okay? Okay, go to the front door, knock three times, then twice. Got it. Good. I will see you here in 22 minutes from now! Ready to do this, babe? Come on. What? Are you sure this is gonna be all right, Cand? Yeah, promise. With you every step of the way. Come on. Yeah? Yeah? Ah! So, deh, di di di di di, come, come, come. Hmm hmm hmm. Now then, hmm, you must be Candy, yes? Yeah, that's right. We spoke on the phone. And you are an acquaintance of Mr. Billy-Ray? Yeah, I know Billy well. Do you mind if I ask how you know him? Ah, I looked at his wife's vagina a few times. It was nothing serious, just a minor crab infestation that caused some irritation and discomfort. So if we may get to the business at hand. You must be Peaches then, yeah? And you are the one with the problem, ah? You do realize that I do not openly advertise my services to anyone, uh? But Billy said it would be okay. I'm sure he did. And it is because I hold him in such high regard that I entertain this assembly between us. Thank you. Now, I must make sure that you are aware of the gravity of the situation that you are about to enter into. She does. Please, Miss Caine, I know you are her friend and that you are only trying to help, but this decision must be solely Peaches', ya? Sorry. Go on Pea, tell him you're fine with it. I do understand what I'm doing here, Dr. Oldcorn. I don't know how the hell I've found myself here but I have. I've literally run out of options. I don't wanna be in this situation, but I didn't create this mess. It's that bastard, and he's gonna get what's coming to him. It's either him or me, and it ain't gonna be me. Well done, babe. Do you see now, Dr. Oldcorn? Please continue. Very well. That brings me to the fee. Don't worry, babe. Like I said, whatever it takes, whatever it costs, we're getting it done. All right? Is everything okay? Yeah, fine, thank you. Miss Peaches? Yeah, it's fine. Very well. Peaches, in your own time, please relate to me your situation, huh? Concentrate on appearance, routine, movement, habit, huh? And include exact layout of your abode. This is most important to me, yeah? Okay, I understand. I'll start with where we live, on the outskirts of Bishop's Hill. Got a small-holding called Rundown Barton. Lived there, both of us, about four years, give or take a month or two. Lionel, he's about six foot, large build... And he literally doesn't move from the house. He'll be there, Doctor, I can assure you. Can't think of anything else I need to tell you. Well, thank you, Miss Peaches, I have all the information I need at this moment. There will now be a period of precisely two days. If you are not here by 20 past nine on Sunday evening with the payment, I will consider the contract closed and the conversation that has just taken place something that happened in a dream, if you understand what I am saying. Yes? Thank you Doctor, I, we understand. Well, I guess that's that, then. What? Well, unless you've got a shit load of cash stuffed up your knickers, we ain't gonna be able to go no further with it, are we? I think you should be looking a little bit closer to home for that cash. What do you mean by that? You ain't got a Scooby Doo about your old man, have you? He's got himself mixed right up in it. In what exactly? Rumor has it, him and Woody were doing a pickup for Jack Crooks, when bam! Old Bill pulled 'em over, your Lionel got away, and Woody got pinched. With drugs? No, that's just it. They hadn't done the pickup yet. But they had a shed load of moody DVD players in the back. He's taken the rap for that. They reckon he's looking at five years. Well, what's that got to do with the money? Well, apparently they got given 250 grand for the deal. But when Lionel arrived back there, there was only 200. Well, that makes some sense now. I wondered what they were doing there earlier. Who? That Eddie Bell and that psycho Sully came round to see Lionel just after he beat the shit out of me. Oh yeah, and what did they say? Don't know. I was halfway up the street when I met 'em. Did say not to come home for a while, though. There you go then. That doesn't mean he's got the money though, does it? All right, it probably does. But he don't give me none of it, fucking wanker. Sits there saying he's skint. I even have to pay for his bloody beer. Coming in for a coffee, then? No, I better get home. Look, with any luck they've put a bullet in Lionel already. And if they haven't? Find the money and get the job done. It's a bit incredible though, don't you think? What? Well, think about it. I need to find 50 grand, and how much is Lionel supposed to have nicked? Fate! Oh come on, you know I don't believe in that crap. All right, coincidence then. Call it whatever. Bottom line is, you've gotta go through with it. Oh come on, look. That fat bastard is probably sat at home right now, counting his money. And if it is Lionel's money, then he's paying for it himself. Technically he's committing suicide. We've done nothing wrong. But it's not Lionel's money, though, is it? Belongs to Jack Crooks and I don't think he's just gonna forget about 50 grand. Well, Jack Crooks can be reasoned with. He ain't no woman beater. Lionel's gone. The 50's gone. He musta done a runner, Mr. Crooks. And if there is no money? Simple, isn't it? Kill or be killed. Come here. You take care. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Where the fuck have you been? Out. I said where? I went over to see Candy. I thought I told you not to see that slag. Please Lionel, no more tonight. It doesn't matter anyway. You won't be seeing her for much longer. I don't understand. We're leaving. Leaving? What are you on about? And why are you all cut up? Fucking Eddie and his little bitch Sully came round tonight. Why? What are you mixed up in now, Lionel? Come with me. What? Come on. Where? I wanna show you something. What the hell is this? This is why we're leaving. This is money, a hell of a lot of money. How much is down there? 50 big ones. 50 grand? Where the hell did you get that sort of money from, Lionel? Hang on, that's why Eddie and Sully were here earlier, isn't it? You do realize, if they're looking for this money, who it belongs to? Look, it don't matter where it came from. All that matters is we've gotta leave. I ain't leaving with you, Lionel. I'd have to be a bloody mad woman to go on the run from that lot. Am I hearing you right? Are you questioning me? All right, I'll think about it. You're not here to fucking think. You're here to do as you're fucking told, bitch. Please, Lionel. I'm the governor round here and you'd do well to remember that. I've told you before, I'll stick you in a fucking pit to rot if you continue to defy me. If I say we're leaving, then you'll be by my side. Or you'll be in the fucking ground. The choice is yours. Okay, Lionel. You win. I'll leave with you. Fucking right you will. And you better not be thinking of doing anything stupid. I'm not. You're right, we should leave. Take the money and get the hell out of this place. I'll be watching you. Fine, but there's no need. It'll be a fresh start for both of us. But please just give me till Monday night to say my goodbyes. You've got till Monday morning to sort your shit out. And you better not breathe a word of this to anyone, especially not that fucking slapper. Of course not. We don't want anyone finding us, I know that. Now you get your ass indoors. Chris, I've got 1.5 mil tied up in this. I don't give a fucking monkey's why he's late so stop messing me about. Well, you tell them if he don't make that payment, I'm gonna cut off his fucking balls! Really? Yeah? Well, you listen up, you fucking fat, overpaid prick you. I'm paying you 500 notes an hour so stop feeding me this fucking bullshit and get the deal done, yeah? Jesus, fucking wanker. Hello, boys. Problems, Jack? Nothing that fat, overpaid, bumbling brief of mine shouldn't be able to fix. How about you two? I hope you got some good news for me. Not any better I'm afraid, Jack. What, this? Anniversary present. Mother-in-law. God rest her soul. Tragic and untimely accident that was. So you didn't find my 50 then? He's sticking to his story, Jack. What about you, do you believe him? Not a chance. He's got that money somewhere, ain't he, Sul? Oh, without a doubt. He's just not telling us. I want you back there Monday. Early, mind. Catch the prick before he gets out of bed. And this time give him a good proper going over. I can do that. I'm sure you can. What about his wife, was she there last night? Yeah, Peaches. Bumped into her coming down the road. Remember what I said. She's not to be touched. She's got nothing to do with this. Yeah, it's a bit late for that. Why? What've you done? Not us. It's Lionel. Made a right mess of her face. That fucking animal. If there's one thing in this world I can't stand is a woman beater. Fucking right. I bet you she'd be right pleased if we got rid of that problem for her. Do you want me to kill him? Nah, not until we find out where that money is and Peaches may be able to help us. Tell you what, bring her to me on Monday after you've seen to him. Yeah? All right, Jack. What? Fuck off, then! All right? Yeah. Ooh, sorry I'm late. Running a bit behind today. They had one of those trainees at the waxing parlor and of course muggins here was guinea pig. I swear she ripped off half my fanny as well as my hairs. Anyway, you okay? Yeah, look, I ain't got a lot of time today. Lionel's on edge. What is it now? Is he running out of beer? Well, yeah, there is that. Have you found something out? What can I get for you? - Nothing, I'm fine thanks. - Well, you can't sit here if you're not gonna buy anything. You know the rules. I come in here every week and buy a cup of coffee, but you're telling me I can't sit here this one time without a drink? I don't make the rules, love. Candy, please, not today. Just order a drink. Coffee, white. Go on, sling your hook! So what's he's said then? You were right. About the money? Yeah, he's got it. Shit! I knew it. Can you get hold of it? Yeah, I think so. I know where he keeps it. But I ain't got a lot of time. You've still got a day and a half. That's just it, I haven't. Lionel's, Lionel's doing a runner. Well, it's good, isn't it? Let him run. If he's gone, problem solved. It's not that easy. He's making me go with him and if I refuse, I'm a dead woman. He's threatened to stick me in the ground again, Cand. Oh. Yeah, oh! And he's... There you go. So go on, tell me what he said. Lionel's given me till Monday morning. That's when we leave. Shit. So I've got to get the money to Oldcorn and beg him to do it tonight. Tonight? Yeah. Can you help me? I can't, I'm working tonight. Can't you get the night off? Lenny'll skin me alive if I don't show up. You can sweet talk him, can't ya? I can't. It's gonna be packed out. He's got a load of bigwigs coming down from TMs. He's got all the girls working. Sorry, babe, you're on your own for this bit. So much for being with me every step of the way. What happened to that, huh? Oh don't be like that, babe. You know I would if I could. I'm sorry, Cand. I just don't know how I'm gonna do it. You'll be fine. You're stronger than you realize. Just go in there and get the money. Say you're gonna come and see me. Get a taxi back here. They're running all night. He won't let me out of his sight. It's only 'cause he ran out of beer I was allowed up here today. One hour he's giving me tomorrow to say goodbye to my mum. I'm not allowed to say anything about us leaving. If he knew I was with you today, he'd kill us both. Get him pissed. Shouldn't be hard. He seems to like it. Keep feeding him beer till he passes out, grab the money, and get there and back fast. I've gotta get back. Peaches. Peaches! Be careful, all right? Yeah, I will. Don't look at it. I need you to do it tonight. Tonight. Tonight? Please. But, Miss Peaches, this is not enough time. Please, I'm so scared. It's the money. If he finds out it's gone, he'll kill me. I did not realize that you were taking it from him to pay for the contract. I must admit, I do like the irony of it, though. So you'll do it tonight? I am sorry, there is not enough time for me to execute the plan at such short notice. The best I can offer you is tomorrow. So what am I meant to do till then? Just hope he doesn't find out? Miss Peaches, there is still time for you to take the money back and forget about this whole matter. I can't. You don't understand. There is perhaps one other option, ah. Please, sit there for a few moments, huh? What's that? This will buy you the time that you need. What's it do? It will stop him from hurting you anymore. I can't kill him. You're supposed to do that. Yeah, I know that. But this, this will not kill him. It will merely render him incapacitated. How long? From the time of administrating the dose, with the amount I have put in here it will render a man of his size unable to move or speak for about 12 hours. So he'll be awake? Oh yes. But I assure you, he will not be able to move. Now, for the most immediate effect, give him the shot in the side of the neck, yeah? Anywhere else and it will take a good few seconds more to work. Right. Oh yeah, Doctor, one other thing. He keeps threatening to bury me alive in our field. I'd like you to do the same to him. More irony, I like it. Okay, it shall be done. Morning, sleepy. What time is it? Just gone quarter past 11. Why the fuck didn't you wake me earlier? Sorry, I thought you needed the sleep. Sleep when I'm dead, won't I? Do you want a coffee? Just bring me a beer. Are you sure you wanna drink today? Course I'm fucking sure. I've started packing a few things. What are you up to? What do you mean? It was never gonna be this easy. I expected you to be kicking and screaming or putting up some sort of fight. You're up to something. I'm not, I swear. Hmm. Peaches! While you're out there, go out the back and bring in that money. Did you hear what I said to you? What, now? Yes, now! Surely you don't want it in here. What if Eddie and Sully come back? Do you think I'm scared of those two cunts? Now you do as you're told. You get outside and you bring me in the fucking money, now! Okay, okay. I'll go and get it. Peaches, I can hear you in there. Why aren't you bringing me that money? Well, where is it? Here! What the, get the fuck off. Bitch! You fucking bitch! You fucking cunt! I knew it. I knew you were fucking up to something. Well, now you're gonna feel my sting. Fucking, dirty bastard! You fucking bastard! Fucking face! I'll fucking kill you! Bastard! What the fuck? Fucking kill you. You mother fucking. So what now? Well, it's your move, you fucking cocksucker! You are one dead fucking bitch. This bitch will not die today. Oh yeah? We'll see about that. You fucking bitch! You fucking dare! I'm gonna fucking kill you, you fucking... Oh, oh, oh! Dirty bastard. Oh, that's better. Do you want one? Oh that's right, don't like smoking, do ya? Wasn't allowed to smoke, was I? I'd love to know what's going on in your head right now. Well, perhaps I wouldn't. But I'd love to know what you're thinking seeing as though you've been such a cunt to me. I bet you're proper fucking scared, ain't ya? Lionel. Well, you should be, 'cause I wouldn't wanna be in your shoes right now. Right. Time to get you tied up. Now, I bet you're wondering why I'm bothering to tie you up seeing as you can't move anyway. But here's the thing, I wasn't planning on injecting you so early but you left me with no choice. It's what now? About half past 11 which is at least half an hour too early. So I need to make sure when you get your movement back, which will be in about 12 hours from now, you don't get any brave ideas, and try and do a runner before you get what's coming to you. Understand? That should do it. Oh, I almost forgot. A little something to remember me by. Should give you some comfort for where you're going. Goodbye Lionel, you dirty little bastard. Hey, Cand, it's me. I'm gonna need to come round yours. Yeah, it's done. Ah, so is good that I am early, yeah? I see you are getting some of your movement back. Now, Lionel. Let's get this moving, shall we? For the night wanes fast. I don't know, I don't know who you are, but you won't get away with this. No! That is where you are very, very wrong. It is you who will not get away with this. I have encountered many people who think that there is no consequence for their actions, huh? But they are wrong. I am the consequence. I'll fucking have you killed. Do you know who I am? You? You are like a thousand people who have been in your position before, Mr. McClure. And a thousand who will be there in the future. I can pay you. Whatever it is, I can pay you more. Please. No, no, no. The time for that is passed. No! A payment has been made and your life is the item that has been purchased. It does not belong to you anymore. Now, if you don't mind, I don't have time for this chit chat. My work must be completed. Comfortable? Fuck you. Lionel, if you keep speaking nasties to me, I shall have to replace your gag. Fuck off! Very well. No, no. No, no, no, no, no. Do not run away. Do not run away. There is nowhere to hide. There is nowhere to hide. And you and I, Lionel, we have an appointment to keep, yeah? In you go. No. Go on, get in. Now! No! Okay, very well. You have two options. One, you get in by yourself and I promise to remove your shackles before I bury you. Or two, I shoot you in both kneecaps, leave you bound, and bury you writhing in agony. I am thinking that this second option is the best one. So are you going to be a good boy and get into the casket? Eh? You don't leave me much fucking choice, do you? Lionel, now, do not do anything stupid because I will shoot you. And I promise you, you will not die quickly from this. So, once again, in you go. In! Whatever it is you're gonna do, just make it quick. On the contrary, Mr. McClure, you will not be killed with immediate effect. But you will be kept alive down there with ample time to think about all the nasty things you have done. Please, I beg you! I'm sorry. Now lie down! No! Please, please don't, no! Whatever she's paying you, I can double it! I've got money. I can pay you. Please. Jack Crooks! He can pay. Fuck you! Fuck you! Peaches! No, please. No, please. Don't do this. No. Please. Bloody hell, Pea. You weren't joking, were you? No. You shoulda seen it, Cand, it was mental. I really thought he was gonna kill me this time. I'm proud of you, babe. I knew you had it in ya. Thanks. Do you think he's out there? Let's go find out, shall we? I can't believe it. He's actually gone. You can't hurt me anymore, Lionel. Now remember what I said. We gotta find that money, and he ain't no good dead. Yeah, I know, Ed. Just been so wound up lately. I really need this. I know. Just gotta get to the bottom of this first. Hello, Lionel? Fucking hell, Sul. What has gone on here? I don't know, Eddie. Something's kicked off, that's for sure. Go and have a look about. Fuck. There's no one here, Ed. I don't like the look of this. Gonna call Jack? No. Let's go and have a look out back. Peaches! Candy. You girls all right? Yeah, all right, thanks. Just about to go inside. What's gone on? Nothing. Don't give me that. Where's Lionel? Don't know. In hell, I hope. You have got to be kidding me. Tell me he ain't down there. Well? Oh fuck off, Eddie. I fancy a cup of tea. Anyone else? Yeah, go on. You got any biscuits? Stop! Nobody goes anywhere. Sully, what the fuck? Sorry, I thought we may as well get a cup of tea while you're sorting out what's going on here, Ed. Stay there. Make sure they don't go anywhere. Jack, you're gonna have to get round here. He's, um, I can't explain. You're not gonna believe this. Right, you lot, what the hell's going on here? And what are you doing standing in a field in the middle of nowhere? Eddie, what the fuck's going on? Where's my money? And where's that sack of shit, Lionel? Down there. What do mean, down there? I mean he's in the ground. Someone fucking buried him, Jack. Well, this is a right fucking cock-up, isn't it? When did this happen? Will somebody please talk to me? Don't know, a couple of hours ago, maybe. Right. Lionel? - Let me out of here! Let me out! Right, dig him up. What the fuck are you looking at him for? Dig him up! What, now? No, sunshine, tomorrow, and we'll all wait here till then. Course fucking now! Cunts! Are these yours? Don't worry, I won't let him hurt you again. I just wanna know where my money is. I... You got something to say to me? No. You sure? We're there, Jack. Well, go on then, open it up. You fucking wankers. Coulda fucking died down here. Easy Lionel, it weren't us who fucking buried you. Enough of this shit! Eddie! Now, where's my fucking money, Lionel? I've told you, I don't have your fucking money! You're a fucking stubborn son-of-a-bitch for someone that's just been buried alive, ain't ya? All right, play it your way. But I'm gonna cut your fucking arms and legs off before I bury you again if you don't tell me where my fucking money is! Sully, go get me an ax. All right, all right, all right. Let go of me! Let go of me and I'll tell you where it is. All right, let him go. It's gone. Oh, I don't fucking believe this. It was there, I swear. Oh, I don't doubt that. But you steal my money in the first place, then you lie about it, cause me all this fucking bullshit, only to turn round to me and tell me you haven't got it. You're a cunt, Lionel. So the question still remains. Where the fuck is my money? Well, they must have it. Well? We haven't got it, I swear. Liars! Those fucking bitches took out a contract on me. You fucking drugged me. If they haven't got it, then they know who has. Shut it, Lionel. You know if there's one thing I can't stand, it's treating women the way you do. I'm sorry, Jack. "I'm sorry, Jack." You're a fucking mug, Lionel, you know that? And you got Woody banged up. Do you know how much that boy means to me, eh? Right, I've had enough of this. Eddie, gimme your gun. Get him up. No. Jack, please, I beg you. You should be fucking glad I'm not chopping your arms and legs off first. Jack. Please! No, Jack, please. Goodbye, Lionel. What the fuck? Fucking gun's jammed now. Can you believe this guy? Drugged, buried alive, and shot. Still won't fucking die. Right, let me handle this. Ah. Oh yeah. It's all to do with that little bugger there, look. What the fuck is he doing? Sully! What? What do you think you're doing? Well, I'm sorting it. All right, Sully, I think I can manage from here. Sorry about that, Lionel. Let's see if this works. Well, stick him back in the fucking pit, then. Dig him up, bury him. It's like working for the fucking council. Now I take it we won't have a problem concerning this issue. Good. Now, Peaches, it has to be said I'm facing a bit of a conundrum when it comes to what to do with you. Seems to me you've inadvertently got yourself involved in a situation that you were largely unaware of. Is that an accurate assumption? Yes, Mr. Crooks. Mmm, thought so. And I'm guessing you hired a professional to get rid of Lionel for you. I don't need to know who. Am I still on the right track? Yes, Mr. Crooks. Please, call me Jack. Now, I don't blame you for doing that, Peaches. But the trouble is, you've paid him with something that isn't yours. And the fact remains, even though it's not your fault, you still owe me a lot of money. I know, but if you can just give me some time, I'll pay you back every penny, I promise. Mmm, I believe you will. Tell you what, fancy a cup of tea? - I take it you got some? - Yeah. I think you should come and work for me. Okay, whatever it takes. How are you on roller skates? Roller skates? Yeah. Why do you ask? I've got an idea for a card room. I think it might be right up your street.
