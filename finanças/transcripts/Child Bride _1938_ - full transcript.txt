[MUSIC PLAYING] [ROOSTER CROWING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Come on, Rex. [MUSIC PLAYING] [WHISTLING] -Freddie!

I put over on her. -Freddie, you want to go up the road with me a piece? -Where are you going? -And it looks like it's going to shower, ain't it?

[HUMMING A TUNE] -Oh, my poor little pig! -I'm acoming, Jennie. -Oh, Freddie. -Gee, she is mean. -Ha-ha-ha-ha, gosh, but you look funny. -Oh, Freddie! -Don't be mad, Jennie. [LAUGHING] -Jennie, you know better to get in there with that old sal. -But Daddy, the little pig was stuck in mud, and, and he was drowning. -Next time you call me. -Get to the barrel and wash yourself. Wait a minute, Jennie-- -And I'm funny? -Well, no. -But you did look kind of silly in there with all those pigs. Anyway, you had to know better. You can't drown a pig in mud. -Well, maybe you can't. But Daddy says that in this country, the pig is the gentleman that pays the rent. And I wasn't going to take any chances. -Hey, wait a minute. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Good morning. -Good morning, children. [BELL RINGING] -Gee, Jennie, why didn't you wear your hat? It's raining. -Just a couple of drops. Sun will be out time we go to school.

We'll take care of him. Now you and Jennie go onto school, dear. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Ira, I guess I was hit. -You going to be all right. -I reckon so. -Mike, tell me who shot you and I'll follow him to his grave. -No, Ira. It's my fight. I'll take care of that skunk when I'm up above. Oh! -Mike, we've got to get him home. -Oh, easy, please, please, easy. (SINGING)--reading, writing, arithmetic, learning a new rhyme. Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. When in school, oh, what fun, studying and play. -Be seated, children. Jennie Colton and Frederick Nulty, please come here. What excuse have you both for being late? -My old man got hurt. Jennie here had to go for help. -Oh, I'm sorry to hear that Frederick. Was it serious? -No, I think he'll be all right. -He should have a doctor, teacher. -There's no doctor in this community now. Later, perhaps. Go on back to your seats. [CHILDREN LAUGHING] -Quiet! Alex Cross, why did you do that? -Teacher, it was a pigeon and he dropped it on my book. [CHILDREN LAUGHING] -Quiet. Alex, you come up here. Bonta, Lila, Bill for your spelling lesson. Bonta, you spell the word "butter." -Butter. B-U-T-T-E-R. -Correct. Lila, the word "banish." -B- I- N- H. -That was a very good try, Lila. You try it, Bill. -Banish. B-A-N-D-H-I-S-H. -You'd better take your book home with you tonight. Alex, you try it. -Banish. B-A-N-I-S-H. -Correct. Now go back to your seat. All right, Jennie Colton, Frederick Nulty, Jeanette, and Tom. All right, Tom, spell the word "catalogue." -C-A-T-A-L-O-Q-U-E. -You didn't study you lesson, did you? -No. -Jeannette, the word "mountain." -M-O. M-O-T-I-A-N. -You'd better study your lesson more thoroughly next time. Jennie, the word "automobile." -A-U-T-O-M-O-B-I-L-E. -Correct.

MISS CAROL (OFFSCREEN) So take out your arithmetic books. -Hey, Cecil, this one's "MA." This is "PA." -Charles! Darling! [MUSIC PLAYING] -Are you really glad to see me? -Why didn't you tell me you were coming? -I just couldn't stand another minute down there in the city with you up here in this God-forsaken. -You know why I stay here. -But you promised that when I became established in my profession, you'd marry me. -Yes, I know. -Well, now I'm assistant district attorney. You, you can't stall me this time. -Oh, I am proud of you, Charles. But I haven't accomplished what I set out to do. -Ah, you're wasting your time. -No, dear, I'm not. -Yes, you are! Now look here, you can't change the customs of these people. Others before you have tried. -But I was born here, they are my people, my blood. -But you've been out in the world. You've gone to school. -Yes, I was fortunate in obtaining an education. Now it's my duty to help them. -All the education in the world wouldn't help them. -But you could help me, if you really loved me. -Of course, I love you, but what could I do? -You can do a lot, dearest. -What for instance? -Just continue to love me and be patient. -Patient? I've been waiting patiently for the last five years. I suppose you want me to wait until I'm an old man. -Charles, I'm going to fight for these people until the state realize that child marriage must be stopped. -Sometimes I wonder if you, if you really do love me. [MUSIC PLAYING] -The purest blood in our land flows in the veins of these mountain people. And yet, the government does less for them and for any group within its boundaries. Government neglect is one cause. And as governor of this state. I beg of you to realize that this child marriage law will be a wedge to free these mountain people from adverse social and economic conditions. -How do you do, gentlemen? There goes that Miss Carol. -Sadie, how is the baby? -Pretty good, Miss Carol. -We're missing you at school. -Well, my husband says there's nothing finer than a bunch of youngins. -But, Sadie, don't you realize that at 25, you will be an old woman. -If that school woman don't go and quit preaching to our women folks, she is fixing to get herself into a mess of trouble. -I thought we have all the women of the village could get together and-- -We don't go meddling in the foreigners' business. Why should you in ours? -I'm not a foreigner. I'm as much a mountain person as any of you. And I'm fighting for the improvement of this community. Now, listen, Mrs. Haggerty, you're a mother. You have seven children of your own. You can't jump from childhood into womanhood by saying I do. -We've got to marry them young. We're short in women. -Well, isn't it better to have a woman for 30 years than a child for 15? But I'm trying to make you understand is that you can't fight nature's law. Bearing children is a woman's job. Child marriage must go. -Your Excellency, this law must pass. Oh, I beg Your Excellency to endorse Miss Carol's bill. -Hey, Happy, come on down. -All right, Angelo. -Hey, you. Did you get that corn up to the Haggens? -Yeah. -Well, where is the money? -I'm giving the money to Ira. -Well, Ira is my partner. It is much mine as if it his. -I'm still giving the money to Ira. -Don't give me any of your lip. Come on, come on, give me that money. -I won't do it! -Why, you-- -Hey, leave him alone! Leave him alone, I tell you. -Are you poor [INAUDIBLE]. -No! No! -Now, can I have that money? -I won't do it. -Give me that! Now, and then I'm going to give you the same dose. -No, Jake, no! -Jake, put him down! -Who do you think you're talking to? -You, you slimy weasel? How many times must I tell you to leave him be? So you want to play? I've been waiting a long time for this chance. And now I'm going to cover your dirty-- -All right, all right. This time I lose. But there'll be a next time. -Ain't gonna be no next time. No! Fill up before I [INAUDIBLE] and take it over that [INAUDIBLE]. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Ira Colton, some day, I'm going to kill you. [MUSIC PLAYING] -I wonder what could have happened to Jake. He should have been here by now. -Maybe he's down to school seeing whether she's out preaching against us marrying youngin. -Why is she doing our education, anyway? Why don't she mind her own business? -I'm for driving her out of town. -Yeah. Tying feathers, risky business. -Oh, you're getting yellow, Clump. -I'd put her in boiling oil and watch her fry if she weren't one of our kind. Why she has a call to me losing that kid, Bella Jensen. Jake, your face looks like it's gone through a trash machine. What happened? -Oh, I had a run-in with a bunch of hijackers on the corn valley. It's a little bit too much [INAUDIBLE]. Is everybody here now? -We're all here. -Good. -What are we doing now? -You, Ezra, Lem, Jeremiah, and Clump, go down through Bone Valley and meet us at the bat cave near the [INAUDIBLE]. Take your masks along and be sure and bring those torches along too. -All right, Jake. -Be careful now. OK, where's my mask? -Oh, there it is. Put out this fire. -All right, let's go. [MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCKING] -Who's there? [KNOCKING] Who is it? [KNOCKING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCKING] [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] What have I done? [SCREAMS] -Happy? Happy! [MUSIC PLAYING] -All right, Jake Bolby, [INAUDIBLE]. I know who are. -Come on! Come on! [MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAMS] -Hey, wait for me! [MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAMS] [MUSIC PLAYING] -You're mad. You're mad, all of you. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Why? Where are you taking me to? What have I done? -There's going towards Spooky Hollow. Come on, Happy. [MUSIC PLAYING] [DOG BARKING] -Rex, shut up. Shut up, Rex. [KNOCKING] -Jennie, they've taken the school ma'am into the mountains. -Well, who? Where? What for? -Go fetch your dad. -Mommy! Daddy! Mommy! -What's the matter? -They've taken my school teacher. -Who has? -I don't know. I was asleep. And her screams woke me up. Then Happy and I ran up to the [INAUDIBLE] and we saw a lot of robed figures with torches. I left Happy to trail them. And he is to meet us at Devil's Rock. [MUSIC PLAYING] -We'll take the shortcut through Devil's Ground. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAMS] -What are you going to do to me? What have I done? -Well, we've given you plenty of warning not to meddle with our customs and to stick to your own ABCs. -[INAUDIBLE], right? -We have our own ideas about what's right and what's wrong in this section. -How dare you to bring me here? I'll have the law up on you. -The law? Ha! We are the law in these here mountains. And I will show you. Bring her over here! [MUSIC PLAYING] -Come on with the tar. Let's get this visit over. -No! No! No, please, no! [SCREAMS] -Take your dirty hands off Miss Carol or I'll [INAUDIBLE] all of you. Get down to tree and help Miss Carol. -Yes, Ira. Yes. -Step up right up against my light. -You two can shoot straight? -You try me. I'm just itching to plug one guy I think is down there. -Make a false move and I'll let you have it. -And take this gun. -I have still got you covered. And I'm acoming. -If it ain't [INAUDIBLE] and Jeremiah. Norm, my friend. [MUSIC PLAYING] And Jake, my partner. -Now, let not. The school ma'am had it coming to her. -And I thought I gave you enough our last time. I'll finish it now. -Jake, did Colton pay you for the interest in that still? -He sent me $40. Just what I put in. But you never can tell. Maybe later, when I get settled, I can get even. -Right here that school ma'am is still staying. Never scared her one bit. -Yeah, I hear she's preaching stronger than before. -Well, when we're on the prowl again, I'll make certain. [MUSIC PLAYING] -I'll beat you undressed, Jennie. -Freddie, you ain't going swimming with me no more, so don't you take your clothes off. -Ah, you're teasing. -No, I'm not. I mean it. -We've always gone in swimming together, why not now? -Teacher says not to. -Why? -Well, because-- because we're not what we used to be. -You mean, we're different? How? -No, we are the same. Only you can't see me my clothes on. -How come? I know how you look without your clothes on. I've seen you lots of times, haven't I? -Yes, I know. But now we're grown up and baring. Teacher said it might put bad ideas into your head. -Oh, shucks. Now I can't kiss you no more. -Of course you can, silly. Only with my clothes on. -All right, but I wish that teacher would mind her own business. -Now, don't nag. See. you look out for me and I'll watch for you. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm going in. -All right. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Jennie, dog is wanting to come, should I let him? -Yes, can't you just say not to let him look at me. Come on, boy. Come on. Come on, Rex. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Pretty, ain't she? -Hey, Jennie, you'd better hide. Somebody's up in the ridge. -OK, I'll hide in the [INAUDIBLE]. -Oh, what do you want? -Nothing of you, you old scarecrow. I know what you're aiming at. -Ah, hush your fuss. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Freddie, bring me my clothes. -Oh, gee. You told me not to look. How can I? -You can't look, but I want my clothes! -All right, all right. [MUSIC PLAYING] Let's go up by the still on our way home. -Nah-huh, I'm cold. Besides, looks like a storm is blowing up. -Well, all right. -[INAUDIBLE], Freddie? -Come on, Rex. -Who was on the ridge? -I think it was Jake [INAUDIBLE]. -Oh, it couldn't be Jake. His field's on the other side of the river. [THUNDER] -Look, there comes Colton, stiffy-eyed again. You'd feel all liquored up too if your wife was fooling around with your partner. -That Jake ain't fooling around with Colton's wife no more. He says he's trapped with that youngin. [THUNDER] [MUSIC PLAYING] -You're home early. I have never made in a JIFFY. You've been drinking again. -Yeah, I have. [SCREAMS] -I scolded! -Pan of frying grease, you're low-down sneak. -What have I done? -You've been carrying on with my partner, Jake Bolby, right in front of my nose. [SCREAMS] --[INAUDIBLE], Ira Not since I married you. -You're lying. [MUSIC PLAYING] -You've got to believe me, Ira. -The whole village is talking about ya. -It's a lie! -I am going to break every bone in your body. -If you hit me again, Ira, I'll kill you, kill you. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Next time you've got to let me go in swimming first. -Well, all right. But Momma said I had to get home in time for supper tonight. [MUSIC PLAYING] -JENNIE (OFFSCREEN) Shame on you, Freddie. -Well, heck. She spoiled all the fun we used to have. I hater her. -Now, Freddie. The teacher is right. -All right. [LAUGHS] [SCREAMS] -Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Oh, Mommy, speak to me, Mommy. Speak to me. Are you hurt? -Oh, Jennie. -Is Daddy drunk again? -Yeah. Something vile. And took it out on me. -Poor Mommy. Come on, Mommy. [MUSIC PLAYING] Mommy. -Jennie? -Yes, Mommy. -Go get him to bed. -All right, Mommy. Come on, Daddy, get to bed. [MUSIC PLAYING] -You'll be catching a cold laying there on the floor, Daddy. Come on, get to bed. Wake up, Daddy. It's your little Jennie. She wants you to come to bed. Oh, Daddy! Oh, Daddy, I can't lift you. Please, wake up. Or, I suppose, I'll have to undress you and put you to bed. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAMS] But Daddy! -Jennie, what's happened? -Oh, Mother. I think Daddy's dead. -No, no, no, it can't be. -Well, I see you crocked him at last. I knew you'd do it sooner or later. And it sure looks like a good job. -No, no, Jake. I didn't do it. -I believe my own eyes, Flora. I saw you do it. -I only scratched his side, I thought. -No, Jake, she didn't, she didn't. -Jake, God as my witness, I didn't do it. -Eh, best part we ain't got no time to lose. Before anyone gets wind of this, I'd like to help you. -Oh, Ira. -Oh, Daddy, tell Jake that Mommy did it. -You fool, don't you understand, this means a lot for you. -All right, Jake. What do you want me to do? But I didn't do it, I tell you. -You're lying, Flora. You're lying and you know it. [INAUDIBLE], we both know that he had it coming to him. -No, he didn't -We ain't got no more time to lose, don't you understand? Jennie, Jennie, you step outside and see that no one's watching when I bring your papi out. Hello? [INAUDIBLE]? [INAUDIBLE]? Go on, go on, get us safe. Go on. -Jake, what are you going to do? -You can leave this fool behind. I'll make it look like he fell over a cliff and [INAUDIBLE] that way. [THUNDER] [INAUDIBLE] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Good bye, Daddy. Good bye. [MUSIC PLAYING] [DOG BARKING] [DOG HOWLING] -Oh, come, Jess. It's only a wolf on a prowl after the rain. [DOG BARKING] -That's no wolf, it's a dog. I bet you somebody's crocked. [DOG BARKING] [DOG BARKING] -Holy Moses. Let's go down. [DOG BARKING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -It would be easy for Jake to get the best of Flora, now that Ira is gone. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Who could kill him? -I got my suspicions. [MUSIC PLAYING] -This is so hard for Flora. -I'm sorry for Jennie. Poor kid. [MUSIC PLAYING] -And these last [INAUDIBLE] are for one Ira Colton, esteemed member of our community, killed by unknown hands.

I want to talk to you about her. -You mean Jennie? -That's right. [MUSIC PLAYING] -What's the matter Jennie? Your face is all puffing up. -Oh, nothing. That Jake Bolby is in the cabin with Mother. And I shouldn't leave her alone with him. -Oh, come on. He won't bite her. We'll take a short swim and come right back. -All right. -All right, that's the way it's going to be, then, because you are going to hang. And you will look pretty with a rope around your neck. -Now I know what you're going to meet for killing Ira. But you ain't going to get my Jennie. You ain't! -Yeah? Well, I'll testify that I saw you killed Ira. -You lie and you know it. And everybody else will know it. -Heh? But they will believe Norm and Ezra, and Jeremiah. I'm going to the county seat tomorrow. That will give you plenty of time to make up your mind. And remember, it won't take their Marshal long. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Howdy, boys. -Hello, Jake. -How does it feel the Coltons are putting this youngin in the community? -I don't see how you do it.

There's nothing else I can do. -If I was a little bigger, I'd kill him! -Freddie! You mustn't say that. Perhaps, we may still be able to stop this child marriage. -Well, I thought you could do it. [MUSIC PLAYING] -If there is anyone here among you who knows of any reason why these two people should not be joined together in holy wedlock, let him speak now or forever hold his peace.
