This man is worth 500 dollars. And this man's going to collect. He's Jake Cahill and he lives by Bounty Law. You don't ever bring men alive, now do you, Jake? Not when there's three of them and one of me. What are you lookin' at, bounty killer? Lookin' at an ugly owl hoot 'bout to get his jaw busted. Amateurs try and take men in alive. Amateurs usually don't make it. Whether you're dead or alive, you're just a dollar sign to Jake Cahill on Bounty Law. Thursdays at 8:30. Only on NBC. Hello, everybody! This is Allen Kincaid on the set of the exciting hit NBC and Screen Gems television series Bounty Law. Now, if you think you're seeing double, don't adjust your television sets because, well, in a way, you are. To my right is Bounty Law series lead and Jake Cahill himself, Rick Dalton. And to my left is Rick's stunt double, Cliff Booth. Welcome, gentlemen and thanks for taking the time to visit with us. Well, it's our pleasure, Al. So, Rick, uh, explain to the audience exactly what it is a stunt double does. Well... Actors are required to do a lot of dangerous stuff. Say, Jake Cahill gets shot off a horse... Now, can I fall off a horse? Yes, I can, yes, I have. Let's say I fall off wrong and I and I sprain my wrist or I- or I twist my ankle, now... that can put an undue burden on production 'cause now maybe I can't work for a week. So, Cliff here is meant to help carry the load. Is that, uh, how you describe your job, Cliff? What, carrying his load? Yeah, that's about right. Join me next week on the set of The Dick Van Dyke Show where I'll be talking to those comical cut-ups Morey Amsterdam and Rose Marie. Till then, this is Allen Kincaid signing off from Hollywood. ♪ 93 KHJ ♪ ♪ Yeah, my man ♪ ♪ All right ♪ ♪ Hey! ♪ ♪ Oh, you're looking good, baby ♪ ♪ I wanna tell you a story ♪ Hey, cutie. ♪ Every man oughta know ♪ ♪ If you want a little lovin' ♪ The flowers. ♪ You gotta start real slow ♪ And that one too's mine. ♪ She's gonna love you tonight now ♪ Good boy. ♪ If you just treat her right now ♪ ♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey! ♪ ♪ Hey! ♪ ♪ Hey! ♪ ♪ Hey! ♪ ♪ All right! ♪ ♪ Hey, yeah! ♪ ♪ Hey! ♪ ♪ Hey, all right! ♪ ♪ Well, it's all right! ♪ ♪ Hey! ♪ ♪ Hey, hey, hey! ♪ ♪ Oh, work it now, one time! ♪ ♪ Ooow! ♪ ♪ You're too much, baby, all right ♪ ♪ Hey! ♪ ♪ Hey! ♪ Murder, revenge and passionate intrigue.

Rick got his driver's license taken away for too many drunk driving tickets. Cliff drives him everywhere now. Oh, fuck. Sounds like a good friend. I try. I want to send you greetings from my wife, Mary Alice Schwarz. Oh, well, that's nice. Thanks a lot. We had... a Rick Dalton double feature in our screening room last night. Oh, well... That's both flattering and embarrassing. What'd you see? 35mm prints... of Tanner and The 14 Fists of McCluskey. I hope the uh... Rick Dalton uh, double feature wasn't too uh... painful for you and the- and the missus. Oh, no. Painful. Stop. What are you saying? Mary Alice loves Westerns. Our whole courtship, we watched Westerns. And we thoroughly enjoyed them. - Oh, that's nice. - Really good. And um, anyway, she goes to bed. I open up a box of Havanas. I light up. I pour myself a cognac. And I watch... The 14 Fists of McCluskey. What a picture. - What a picture. - Good picture, yeah. Got to be so much fun. All the shooting. I love that stuff, you know, the killing. A lotta killing, a lotta killing. So gentlemen, the plan is we reverse our forces und drive the Allies back into the sea! And have nowhere to go. Hermann! Open the curtains! Jawohl! Anybody order fried sauerkraut?! Burn, you Nazi basterds! That's you operating the flamethrower, isn't it? Oh, you bet your sweet ass it was, yeah, yeah. It was you? Yeah, l-let me tell you, th-th-that's one shitfuck crazy weapon. Y-You do not want to be on the wrong side of, boy, oh, boy. Now, I-I practiced with that dragon, uh... three hours a day for two weeks. N-Not just 'cause I wanted to look good in the picture but because I was I was shit scared of the damn thing, to be honest. Might fucking lose! Burn in a massive death! All right, that's too hot. Anything we could do about that heat? Rick, it's a flamethrower. Yeah. So I came to the office early today... and I watched two episodes of Bounty Law on a 16mm. Jodey Janus. Wanted for cow rustling in the state of Wyoming. 425 dollars, dead or alive. And you brought him here to collect. I don't even know where here is. This was the closest place. Caught up with him about five miles outside of town. So, bounty killer... the name of this town is Janustown. That boy you killed... Jodey Janus... he was the baby boy of Major Nathan Maxwell Janus. Who is... Major Nathan Maxwell Janus? Well, I'll be sure to introduce you when he gets here. Bounty Law. Starring Rick Dalton.

Bingo Martin with that kid Scott Brown. And I got a FBI that airs this Sunday. You uh, you always play the bad guy on these shows? Yeah. Mmm. So, and they have a fight scene at the end? Well, not... Land of the Giants or FBI but the rest, yeah. And you lose in the fight? Yeah, of course. I'm the heavy Oh... that's an old trick pulled by the networks. You take Bingo Martin - for example. - Mm-hmm. So, you got a new guy like Scott Brown. You want to build up his bona fide. So you hire a guy from a canceled show to play the heavy. Then at the end of the show when they fight... it's hero besting heavy. But, what the audience sees is Bingo Martin... whipping Jake Cahill's ass. You see? Then next week, it's Ron Ely. The next week it's... Bob Conrad wearing his tight pants... kicking your ass. Yeah. Now in another couple of years playing punching bag to every swinging dick new to the network, it's gonna have a psychological effect on how the audience perceives you. Right. So, Rick... who's gonna kick the shit outta you next week? Mannix? The Man from U.N.C.L.E.? The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.? How about Batman and Robin? Ping! Pow! Chum! Zoom! Down goes you. Down goes your career as a leading man. Or do you go to Rome and star in Westerns? And win fucking fights. Muchas gracias. All right, what the matter, partner? It's official, old buddy.

Don't cry in front of the Mexicans. What's gotten you so upset, man? Well, if coming face to face with the failure that is your career ain't worth cryin' about, then I don't know what the fuck is. Why? That guy in there turn you down? No. He wants to help me get into Italian movies. Well, then, what's the problem? I gotta do fuckin' Italian goddamn movies! That's the fuckin' problem.

Then if you need him, you got him, right? Then I gotta have a conversation with that wardrobe assistant, and man, she's a fuckin' bitch, I just don't...

And I can't afford to hire a bunch of guys to smoke cigarettes and sit around talkin' to each other all day on the chance that I might use 'em. I got a four man team here, Rick. I need more than that, I gotta get it approved. And you know, I-I gotta look after my dudes. Hey, a-and if your dudes were a better match for me, I'd say, o-okay, you got me, b-b-but but th-that's not the case and you know it. He's a great fuckin' match for me. Yeah, yeah, I know. Hey, you could do anything you want to him. Shit, th-throw him off a building, right? Light him on fire, hit him with a fucking Lincoln, right? Get creative, do whatever you want. He's just happy for the opportunity. Rick. Yeah. I don't dig him. And I don't dig the vibe he brings on set. What, is there some old beef between you two? Come on, man. What? The dude killed his fuckin' wife. Oh... come on, man. You don't believe that old shit, do you? Yes, Rick, I do. And I work with my wife and she believes it. She didn't want his creepy ass around. You know, this is probably the shittiest weather ever. The shittiest weather on the shittiest boat with the shittiest person. Natalie, my sister, said, "He's a loser." "He's a loser." They all said it, "He's a fuckin' loser", and I didn't believe them. So, I guess I'm the fuckin' idiot. And now you're not gonna talk to me? What, you don't feel like fighting? Well, I feel like fucking fight. And I've been up here by myself for four hours on this fucking shithole of a boat... Yeah. He's a goddamn war hero. Okay, you fuckin' horse's ass. Let's get you over to wardrobe. Now, I'll put you in wardrobe, but you don't stunt, I don't pay you. Appreciate the opportunity, Randy. I won't let you down. You know my wife, Janet, don't you? Yeah. Steer clear of her. Now, I admire Cassius Clay, I do. What I admire is in his sport, there's an element of true combat. When Cassius Clay meets Sonny Liston in the ring, that's not two athletes posturing. That's combat. Two men trying to kill each other right now. If you don't beat him, he kills you. That's beyond athletics. That's beyond Wide World of Sports, you know? That's two warriors engaged in combat. That's what I admire. In martial arts tournaments, they won't let you fight like that. It's very frustrating. You stand in front of a guy, you just wanna let him have it. But you can't. So you gotta do this play-acting, pattycake version. Cassius Clay, Sonny Liston, Joe Lewis. The colored boxer, not that white kickboxing asshole. They do what they need to do to win. They unleash as much punishment as they have to to defeat the other guy. But in martial arts tournaments, I do to win what they do to win. I unleash all my power. I kill people. Well, if you fought Cassius Clay, who would win? Well, that would never happen. But if you did, what do you think would happen? I'd make him a cripple. Hey, you. What's your name? - Me? - Yeah, you. My name's Cliff. I'm Rick Dalton's stunt double. Stuntman? Yeah. You know, you're kind of pretty for a stuntman. That's what they tell me. So, did I say something funny, stuntman? - Yeah, you kinda did. - What's so funny? Look, man, I don't want any trouble. I'm just here to do a job. But you're laughing at what I'm saying, but I'm not saying anything funny. So, what do you think is so funny? What I think is... you're a little man with a big mouth and a big chip. And I think you should be embarrassed to suggest that you'd be anything more than a stain on the seat of Cassius Clay's trunks. Brother... you're the one with the big mouth. And I would really enjoy closing it especially in front of all my friends. But my hands are registered as lethal weapons. That means... we get into a fight, I accidentally kill you, I go to jail. Anybody accidentally kills anybody in a fight, they go to jail. It's called manslaughter. I think all that lethal weapon horseshit is just an excuse so you dancers never have to get in a real fight. Okay. How about a friendly contest? No punching in the face, two out of three. Who puts who on the ground first. Nobody tries to hurt nobody, just... who ends up on their butt. That's a great idea, Kato. You know, Bruce, that guy's kinda famous. That guy? For what? Killed his wife and got away with it. That guy? That guy. Not bad, Kato. Try that again. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa! What the fuck is going on here? Hey, jackass, this is our series lead. The fuck are you thinking? You're right, Janet. I'm sorry about that. Don't fucking Janet me, you prick. Hey! What's up, babe? "What's up", Randy is that your loser asshole wife-killing buddy boy here was beating the shit out of Bruce! What? Hey, Randy. Cliff! What the fuck, man? Let me just say... nobody beat the shit out of Bruce. It was a friendly contest. He barely touched me. I think that dent in the car says somethin' different. Oh, my God! What the fuck did you do to my car? What the fuck did you do to her car? I threw this little prick into it but I did not know it was her car. Get the wardrobe off, get your shit and get fucked! - Janet! - What? I will handle this. Then, fucking handle it, Randy! Cliff... get the wardrobe off, get your shit and get off the lot.

I know we just broke for lunch, but you need to wait at least an hour before you can eat. Give the glue a chance to dry. No worries, honey. I got my book. Say, say... Where's the bad guy saloon? You just go straight to Western town, take a right and a left and you'll see it right there. Thanks, honey. Hello. Hello. Hello. Bother you if I sat next to you, and read my book, too? I don't know. Would you bother me? I'll try not to. Sit. Sorry. Sorry 'bout that. You don't eat lunch? I've got a scene after lunch. Yeah? Eating lunch before I do a scene makes me sluggish. I believe it's the job of an actor, and I say actor not actress because the word actress is nonsensical. It's the actor's job to avoid impediments to their performance. It's the actor's job to strive for 100% effectiveness. Naturally, we never succeed, but it's the pursuit that's meaningful. Who are you? You can call me Mirabella. Mi-Mirabella what? Mirabella Lancer. No, no, c-come on, W-What's your real name? When we're on set, I prefer to only be referred to by my character's name. It helps me immerse in the reality of the story. I've tried it both ways and I'm always just a tiny bit better when I don't break character. If I can be a tiny bit better... I want to be. You're the bad guy. Caleb DeCoteau. Thought it was pronounced Caleb DeCoteau. I'm pretty sure it's DeCoteau. - DeCoteau. - Mm-hmm. DeCoteau. DeCoteau. What are you reading? It's a biography on Walt Disney. It's fascinating. He's a genius, you know. I mean, once in every 50 or 100 years kind of genius. Wh-What are you, twelve? I'm eight. What are you reading? Just a Western. What does that mean? Is it good? Pretty good. What's the story? Haven't finished it yet. I didn't ask for the whole story. What's the idea of the story? Well... it's about, uh, this guy who's a bronco buster. It's a story of his life. The guy's name is Tom Breezy but everyone always calls him Easy Breezy. Now, when Easy Breezy was in his 20s and-and young and good-lookin', he could he could break any horse that you can throw at him. Back then, he just had a way. Now, he's into his, uh, late 30s and takes a bad fall and messes up his hip He's not... crippled or anything like that, but... but he's got spine problems he's never had before and he spends, uh, more of his days in pain than he ever did before. Jeepers, it sounds like a good novel. Yeah, it's not bad. Where are you in it? About midway. What's happening to Easy Breezy now? Uh, he's, uh... He's not the best anymore. In fact, far from it. He's comin' to terms of what it's like to be slightly more... use... Slightly more useless each day. I-It's okay, Caleb. It's okay. Sounds like a really sad book. Poor Easy Breezy. I'm practically cryin' and I haven't even read it. About 15 years, you'll be livin' it. What? Nothin' pumpkinpuss. I'm just... I'm just teasin' ya. You know somethin', you, uh... you might be right about this book. I think it hits harder than I gave it credit for. I don't like names like "pumpkinpuss"... but since you're upset... we'll talk about that some other time. ♪ Yesterday a child came out to wonder ♪ ♪ Caught a dragonfly inside a jar ♪ ♪ Fearful when the sky was full of thunder ♪ ♪ And tearful at the falling of a star ♪ ♪ Then the child moved ten times round the seasons ♪ ♪ Skated over ten clear frozen streams ♪ ♪ Words like, when you're older, must appease him ♪ I'm only going as far as Westwood Village Hey, beggars can't be choosers.

Hey, Rick, I gotta ask you somethin' I heard about. Was it true you almost got the McQueen part in The Great Escape? Hilts, isn't it? Captain Hilts, actually.

Peppard, Maharis, and Chakiris. - Oh, man! - Yeah. That's gotta hurt. Yeah, well, I didn't get it. McQueen did it. And frankly, I never had a chance. Ten days isolation, Hilts.

And you all take care of him. Oh, we take care of George. We love George. Well, is there anything wrong with me saying hello to an old friend? You can't see him right now. Why can't I see him right now? 'Cause he's napping. This is his naptime. Well, I think I'll just go see for myself. You never know. He mighta just woke up. The Hawaiian guy's coming this way.

George is taking a nap right now. Oh, that is unfortunate. Yes, it is. What's your name? Cliff Booth. How do you know George? I used to shoot Westerns here at the ranch. When was the last time you saw George? Oh, I'd say about... eight years ago. Oh. I'm sorry, I didn't realize the two of you were so close. Well, when he wakes up, I'll let him know you came by. I'd really like to say a quick hello now, while I'm here. Came a long ways. Don't know when I'll get back this way again. Oh, I understand but I'm afraid that's impossible. Impossible. Why is that impossible? Because me and George like to watch TV on Sunday nights. FBI and Bonanza but George finds it hard to keep awake that late so I make him take a nap around now so I don't get tripped out of my George's TV time. Well, look, red, I'm comin' in there. With my own two eyes, I'm gonna get a good look at George. And this... ain't stoppin' me. Okay. Suit yourself. You never know. The next boy you meet may be the one.

He back there? Door at the end of the hallway. You might have to shake him awake, I fucked his brains out this morning. He may be tired. Oh, Mister Eight-Years-Ago... George is blind. So you'll probably have to tell him who you are. George, you awake? George? George? George? George! Hi, George. - What's going on? - Everything's all right. I'm sorry to disturb you. Who are you? It's Cliff Booth. Just stopped in to say hello and see how you're doin'. John Wilkes Booth? Cliff Booth. Who's that? I-I used to shoot Bounty Law here, George. I was Rick Dalton's stunt double. Who? Rick Dalton. The Dalton brothers...? Rick Dalton. Who's that? He was the star of Bounty Law. Who are you? I was Rick's stunt double. Rick... who? It don't matter, George. We were colleagues from the past and I just wanted to... make sure you're doin' okay. I'm not doin' okay. What's the matter? Can't see shit! Would you call that "the matter"? The man can't see shit, okay? I'm sorry about that. I was told... Squeaky sent me to bed. Would that be the little redhead out front? What the fuck is the matter with you? First, you wake me up, and now you're pretending that I didn't tell you I was fucking blind! How am I gonna know what the hell color the head of the girl is that's with me all the time? Oh, fair enough, George. No, it's all right. Everyone don't need a stuntman. I don't know who you are... but you touched me today. You came to visit me. Now I gotta go back to sleep. I gotta watch FBI tonight. And I watch it with Squeaky. She gets all pissed off if I fall asleep. What happens if she gets pissed off, George? Nothin'. I just don't like to disappoint her. So, you gave all these hippies permission to be here? Just who the fuck are you? I'm Cliff Booth. I'm your stuntman. We used to work together, George. I just wanna make sure that you're okay. That all these hippies aren't taking advantage of ya. - Squeaky? - Yeah. She loves me. So, suck on that. Take care, George. Goddammit. You embarrassed me. Yeah, sorry 'bout that. How'd your little talk with George go? Are we kidnapping him? Not the word I'd use. Well, now that you've talked to him, do you believe everything's all right? Not exactly.

After that Musso and Frank's lunch meeting, Marvin did provide Rick job opportunities in the Italian film industry. Rick Dalton, Marvin Schwarz here. Hold on. Hennessy XO on the rocks. Yes, Mr. Schwarz. Two words: Nebraska Jim, Sergio Corbucci. N-Nebraska what? Sergio who? Sergio Corbucci. And who's that. The second best director of Spaghetti Westerns in the whole, wide world. He's doing a new Western, it's called Nebraska Jim. And because of me, he's considering you. Well, Rick got Nebraska Jim. And Rick made a rather compelling Nebraska Jim existing quite nicely within Sergio Corbucci's rogues' gallery of antiheroes. In Rome, Rick loved the paparazzi and the fuss they made over him and his Nebraska Jim co-star, Daphna Ben-Cobo Right there, paparazzo. What about me-a Rick! He loved the food so much that during his stay, Rick gained almost 15 pounds. But he didn't love the Italians' way of making movies. In fact, he thought the post synched every actor speaks their own language Tower of Babel shooting style of European movies was ridiculous. While in Rome, Marvin plugged Rick into three other Italian productions. His second Western was Kill Me Quick, Ringo, Said the Gringo. Also starring Joseph Cotten and directed by Calvin Jackson Padget pseudonym for Giorgio Ferroni. His third was an Italian-Spanish co-production that paired him with Telly Savalas titled, Red Blood, Red Skin. directed by Joaquin Romero Marchant and based on the Floyd Ray Wilson novel, The Only Good Indian is a Dead Indian. And his fourth, a spaghetti secret agent James Bond ripoff type flick called, Operazione Dyn-o-mite! Directed by Antonio Margheriti. Ultimately making Rick's six-month Italian sojourn fairly profitable. Although his swank Roman apartment ate up a big chunk of his earnings. So, as Rick return to Hollywood via Pan-Am... he has four new movies under his belt, some money in his pocket, and his brand spanking new Italian wife Scarlett Francesca Capucci. Hurtling through the air towards a new life and uncertain future, Rick was really not sure about what lay ahead for him. Way back in coach, working on his bottomless Bloody Mary, Cliff Booth returned to Los Angeles as well. He kept Rick company during his entire six-month stay in Italy. However, as the two men returned home, they've come to an understanding. Here it goes now. With the, uh... with the new wife, I, uh... I just, I-I can't afford you anymore, Cliff. You know. I could barely afford my own house anymore. So, the plan is to... sell the house and buy... buy a condo i-in Toluca Lake, bank the money, you know, live off it, that type of thing. Hopefully I'll score come next pilot season. It's a good plan. Yeah. But I don't know if I have a career or not, if... I'm a solid Los Angeles citizen like Eddie O'Brien says or if I'm one step closer to going back to Missouri. When this whole European journey's over, I think we've, uh... we've reached the end of the trail, Cliff. So, these last four Italian flicks, after nine years together, would be Rick and Cliff's final rodeo. Cliff doesn't have a clue what he's gonna do. The only thing the two men know of for sure, tonight, Rick and Cliff will have a good, old-fashioned drunk. Both men know once the plane touches down in El Segundo, it'll be an end of an era for both of them. When you come to the end of the line with a buddy who is more than a brother and a little less than a wife, getting blind drunk together is really the only way to say farewell. ♪ You don't know what's going on ♪ ♪ You've been away for much too long ♪ ♪ You can't come back ♪ ♪ And think you are still mine ♪ ♪ You're out of touch, my baby ♪ ♪ My poor old-fashioned baby ♪ ♪ I said baby, baby, baby ♪ ♪ You're out of time ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time ♪ ♪ I said baby, baby, baby ♪ ♪ You're out of time ♪ ♪ Yes, you are left out ♪ ♪ Yes, you are left out, yes, you're ♪ ♪ Left out of there without a doubt 'cause ♪ ♪ Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time ♪ Where do you want it?

What's going on at the dirty movie place? They're having a premiere. Dirty movies have premieres? Yeah, they're fun! I know. Right here for you. Gentlemen. While closer to 8:30, Rick and Cliff went to the Valley Mexican restaurant landmark Casa Vega on Ventura. Well, well, well, if it ain't the cobra himself. Hey, Doug, what's happening? Hey, Rick, how you doing? It's good to see you. How's the wife doing? Just kidding. Brandy stayed behind at Rick's house guarding the beautiful Italian woman asleep in her bed and waiting for Cliff and Rick to come home while jet lagged Francesca slept. But you just get paid for the day that you cut his hair though, right? No, no, I get paid a thousand dollars a day. I get paid a thousand dollars the day I arrive... At El Coyote, margaritas and good times were had by all except Sharon. Sharon was experiencing a touch of pregnancy-induced melancholy. Not only that, it was later reported that it was the hottest night of the year. And it made her feel especially pregnant in all the worst ways. Hungover, I don't wanna party anymore, I'm tired. He just got it done. No, it's not 'cause he just got it done. He got just as much time as all the rest of the goddamn directors. But it's what he did with that time. At Casa Vega, Rick and Cliff drank so much that when they left, they left the Cadillac there and took a cab home. The greatest action director, underrated guy of all time. Around 10:00, Sharon and her friends left El Coyote and arrived back at her house. I had like, 19 margaritas. The four of them hung out a little while longer with Abigail even playing the piano for them. ♪ Don't get me mad ♪ ♪ Don't tell no lie ♪ ♪ Don't make me sad ♪ ♪ Don't pass me by ♪ ♪ Baby are you holding ♪ ♪ Holding anything but me? ♪ ♪ 'Cause I'm a real ♪ ♪ Straight shooter if you know what I mean ♪ ♪ You can bring me love ♪ ♪ You can hang around ♪ ♪ You can bring me up ♪ ♪ Don't you bring me down ♪ Until she returned to her room, smoked a joint and read a book. That was around 11:00. I love you, too, Charles. And now it's time for what I know you've all been waiting for. A little fanfare please? At more or less the same time, Voytek laid on the couch watching American television and thought about how much better it was than Polish television as he smoked a big joint. Somewhere around 11:10, Sharon changed into her comfy house attire. Feel better? Drastically better. It was after 11:45 by the time the yellow cab dropped Rick and Cliff in front of the house. Hey, right here for you. Grazie, amico. Brandy was glad to see them return. More margaritas. Around midnight, a completely drunk Rick Dalton started making a blender of frozen margaritas. All right. We're walkin'. At the same time, Cliff was attaching a leash to an excited Brandy's dog collar. I remember you. A cigarette dipped in acid. What's that do? You smoke it, it gets you high. - How much? - 50 cents. 50 cents. Hippie girl, 50 cents. Tonight the night? Why not? Away we go. Our Polish friend said it was the hottest day of the year.

Hmm? How about you? Are you calling me a liar? No, of course not. Good. Hold it. Was that Rick Dalton? Who? The guy from Bounty Law. Who, Jake Cahill? Yeah! That guy in the road was Jake Cahill. Ho... wait a minute. That was fucking Jake Cahill that just yelled at us? He was older, but yeah, I think so. Who's this Rick guy? Jesus Christ, Sadie, get it together! Rick Dalton played Jake Cahill on a cowboy show in the 50s called Bounty Law. Fuck you, Katie. Sorry I don't know the name of every fascist dog TV in the 50s. I can't believe that asshole in the road was Jake Cahill! When I was a kid, I had a Bounty Law lunch box. That was my favorite of all my lunch boxes. Dig this... You've been having our trip session, I've been expanding on this one idea in my head. Alright, dig it. We all grew up watchin' TV, you know what I mean? And if you grew up watchin' TV, that means you grew up watchin' murder. Every show on TV that wasn't I-I Love Lucy was about murder. So, my idea is... we kill the people who taught us to kill. I mean, where the fuck are we, man? We are in fucking Hollywood, man! The people an entire generation grew up watching kill people live here. And they live in pigshit fucking luxury. I say, fuck 'em. I say we cut their cocks up and make 'em eat it. That's a great idea, Sadie. You two ready to kill some pigs? Wait a minute. Uh, shit. Sor... I forgot my knife in the car. Can I go- Can I go back and get it? - Yeah, sure. - Okay. - Wait a minute. - What? I locked the car. You'll need keys to get in. Oh. Right. Thank you. Okay. I'll be right back. Hurry up.
