Greetings to all, after 5 continuous blockbuster hits. With his 6th film Missile he has achieved double hat-trick. Not only in India, at jet-set speed he's our intercontinental artistic missile. We extend a hearty welcome to our sensational director Mr. Naveen K! MISSILE "In your own right you are a hero true" "When is your silver screen debut?" "Why get into that rut, master?" "Even mighty heroes obey me for sure" "Unstoppable is your success" "They say it is my weakness" "You inflate the budget; ever so clever" "They make money twice over" "Any plans of a Pan-India release?" "All over India I have my fans to please" "I set the trend" "I am the brand And the legend" "Box office too I command with my golden hand" DHAGULBAAJI (THE CROOK) KASAK (SLASH) ROADSIDE ROWDY MODHATI MAGAADU (THE FIRST MAN) BAD BOY GOOD BOY GOOD BOY BAD BOY "Your horoscope says you are #1 always" "The genius you display represents an era per se" "From the day I was born, this is me I am a rule breaker, obviously!"

This will do If I think of something, I'll tell you" "I will call for a Press Meet then. Bye, till we meet again" This... This is what I want. There are 2 types of audience. Those who care about logic and those who don't care one bit. 'If you liked 'Missile' you belong to the 2nd category.' Reviewer is implying, 'Your karma, dig your own grave'. 'Even though the story drags here and there.' 'Director Naveen has excelled in the placement of songs impressively' 'In the sentimental scenes, his dialogs are melody to the ears' 'Making the viewers teary-eyed.' Giving us a 'kick' with his pre-climax peppy dance. 'Driving us to the edge with the climax fight.' 'He has given a super hit. Hats off to Naveen!' 'You've struck gold again, congrats.' I get cheap thrills making prized fools out of sworn intellectuals like you, dude Boss, all I said was you've won... But I never said I lost! Oh! What is this? 'Sahiti Sravanthi's' 'Best Author of 2020 is...' 'M--' 'Is M. Venkatramana.' 'Collection of stories' Some Telugu tongue twister. 'Jigyansa' (Curiosity) Some small honor. A classy literary organization invited me, I accepted. Writing short stories in magazines no one ever reads. In unknown literary clubs in random alleys. Getting felicitated with useless certificates. Being lauded with cheap garlands. And teaching meaningless lessons in the same Govt college. Hey! You and I began our career at the same time. Where are you? Where am I? Darling... I don't know where you are but I am absolutely happy where I am. In your dreams! Watch this, I'll tell you. [TV]You have kept your word! You have 'eliminated' our hero, brother. Long live! Naveen brother! -Other heroes will go mad. -'Eliminate' instead of 'elevate'! That's reality for you. Your temerity is too much. I've given 6 super hits in 6 years. You may not be lucky the 7th time. That's precisely why... I want you on board as my writer. I am all spent I need fresh ideas. -Oho! -Forget your ideologies and come. You can become a millionaire. How long will you rot in that 2 bedroom apartment? My dear buddy, rather than wallowing with you in your mediocrity... I prefer to stick to my burrow lacking in luxuries and millions. I'm content with my short stories. I lack your ability to write trash and make fools out of people. My dad is calling. -Tell me, Dad? -Your amma is showing off our TV. You sent us a new home theater, right? She has invited the entire neighborhood over. Oh! Is it good? What is that car you've bought for her? -What happened? -That car What is it called? Jag... Jagwa. Jaguar... Jaguar. She mumbled something like a Jaguar would have been ideal. What you've sent is not such a popular brand it seems! Won't a Jaguar be too flashy in your small town? She won't go too far... She either buys sarees or goes grocery shopping. Her route is limited. Change it, otherwise she'll feel bad. Okay... How are you? A 10 acre plot near the highway is up for sale. Shucks! How is your health? Let's buy that plot... It is being sold dead cheap it seems. Hello, dear, I believe it's something called 'Palatinum' by Tata. -Platinum! -Ha... Hmm, same. Along with the 'Jagawar' send me that ring too. Didn't your father tell you? Okay. Typical! She has to keep up with the Joneses! Now... that 10 acre plot near the highway... Dad, I'm in a meeting I'll call you back later. Okay... Okay. -Bulraj told me that... -Okay, bye. Jaguar... Platinum... Your family is as purely commercial as one can get, right?_ Okay, bye. I have to apply. Apply your mind to a story? Nah! I mean I want to apply balm. Got a splitting headache. Tonight I have a meeting with my producer Mr. Fancy Parmeshwar._ I know how it will be, first you'll throw up an idea. You'll start shooting. You'll put him on a leash. Again you'll start shooting. Looting the producer... -Toast and roast. Roast and toast. -You go home, dude. Hey... Wait! My shawla and my garland. You threw it in my presence. You'll trash it in my absence. -Okay, think of what I asked you. -Will do. 'Nothing succeeds like success!' -Tell me? -Sir, my story-- My story revolves around a girl who is like a beautiful princess. I'll narrate it to you... You've crossed that stage of getting your storyline approved long ago. This is the 2nd film we are making together. It has to be a commercial blockbuster! We must make it earth-shattering. Done, sir. Let's shoot a dance number before the story gets into shape. Super! All I need is some attractive shape to excite me. I'm sure you are aware. Sir, we'll get a new face for the heroine. None of the girls is suitable now, sir. Give me the name and payment... Rest is all up to you. I'm not involved at all. -Thank you, sir, I'll take leave. -Alright. -I'll see you, madam. -You didn't eat anything? I had, madam. -He's on a diet, dear. -Okay. I'll ask our priest to fix a day for the inauguration. Text me your date of birth via WhatsApp. I'll perform a prayer to our family deity. -We must hit the bull's eye. -We've already hit, bingo! That's the spirit I wanted. [radio]:Hi, bro! What's up? Did you watch the new Naveen K's film? Missile! I did, bro, he loves serving the same cake with the same icing! -I didn't like it, bro! -Oh no! Looks like only I liked-- [mobile chimes] [car honking] [tires screeching] Hey... Hey! Stop! Bloody Sleazebag! Mr. C. V. Rao from Annapurna Studios has sent you a hard disk, sir. -You wanted digital transfer of a reel-- -Yeah... Yeah, give it to me. "Oh! Is this a flash of silver lightning?" "Whispering to the girl's eyes tantalizing" "Oh! Why is it so mesmerizing?" "Oh! In that hint of a smile half-seen" "Behind that veil... Hidden" "What are those spells unspoken?" "Is she shrouded in mysteries unsolved for centuries?" "Oh! Like unpenned poetry" "Like a tuneful melody sending me into a rhapsody" "Or the sound of silence tinkling like an anklet in cadence?" "I don't know..." "Truth be told really this seems like a dream to me" "I still don't know, how can I to the dream, turn a blind eye? "I don't know..." "Truth be told really this seems like a dream to me" "I still don't know, how can I to the dream, turn a blind eye? "Which chisel's vivid imagination crafted this sculpture to such perfection?" "Which statue in reality roamed around as this beauty?" "Won't 1000 glances in sight glow as lamps shining bright?" "In someone's heart somewhere is she enshrined with care?" [yawns] -Hello, sir! -Hello, Bose. -Did he ask you to come too? -Yes, sir. Working as his co-director is scratching your head with red-hot firewood. He doesn't give breaks between his films. That too, I'm a bachelor, right? He wrings me dry! He wants me to ditch my Govt. job and join him as a writer. His timings won't work for me. Please come, sir... I'll get some relief. You can also share our torture. -[laughs] -Bose! Strange, he seems to be in high spirit! Looks like he has got a new idea other than the hero as an orphan. Maybe in the climax we discover he is an orphan. -[both laughs] -Hey! Come up! -Coming, sir. -Let's go. Wow! She's super hot! Our men will have their hands full! Hey! Stunning, sir. She is very beautiful, Naveen. Last night, I told Mr. Fancy... I want to make a film about a girl who looked like a beautiful princess. And was planning to cast a new face. In the next half hour I found her, dude. Who is this girl? I don't know, this can rolled out of a trash can. Trash can? What were you doing next to a trash can? Did you guzzle some cheap brand? Hey! Will you shut up! Hope he cleaned it well. I'll tell you that story later. Have you seen this girl anywhere? Who shoots on film these days, sir? Looks like it is 6-7 years old. Someone must have shot it for a trial or a showreel. But, sir... I must say that director had selected the heroine with such personal care... Bose...! Sorry, boss! -Make enquiries about this girl. -Mm-huh? Silently! Don't tell anyone about this reel, just find out about her. Done, sir. Please play it again, sir, I'll click some snaps. She has a certain aura about her. We can never predict when, where or how we will be inspired in our life. I have found my princess. Hello, Mr. Subbu, how are you? I want a piece of information, sir. -Have you seen this girl anywhere, sir? -No, sir. -Okay, sir. -Alright, sir. -Have you seen her? -No! -Have you seen this girl? -No, brother. -I didn't... -Sure? This girl, sir. [in Hindi] Have you seen this girl anywhere? -Uh! Uh! -You must have seen this girl somewhere. Nah! No, sir. [whistles] -Uh! Huh! -Are you sure? Found her? I've searched till I reached the rolling titles, sir. I can't do it anymore. Better to forget this girl. [vehicle honks] Sorry, sir... Already 3 films are lined up. Next one will be produced by Mr. Fancy. I'll speak to Mr. Fancy, I'll persuade him to produce after you finish my film. No need, sir. You know, he is the producer who gave me a break. He has waited for me for 3 whole years. To go back on my word... I don't think it's correct. Fan's doesn't need you as much as I do, Naveen. I am in a financial mess. If you do a film for me it will be a timely help. Please understand my plight. Sir, I would like to help you too. But you should understand my situation too. I'm really sorry We'll meet again. For sure. Right here-- Hi, sir. -What is he saying? -Your director is over confident. He's acting pricey with no respect for a senior like me Literally wants me to beg What happened, sir? -Bring him down to the earth, okay? -Oh! -Or he'll fall flat on his face some day. -[groans] [tuts and chuckles] -What's he cribbing about? -What do you think? His ego is bruised again. My ego is fully satisfied I love the kick I get out of turning down a senior producer. You don't have to be that mean, sir. -That man deserves it... -Pity! He paid Rs. 250 for a coffee he didn't even drink! Let me have the pleasure! [inaudible] Hey! Bose... Reel! That's our girl! Sir, your coffee! Hello? Hello! Sir... Sir! -Shucks! -What is it, sir? -A girl went in an Innova just now -Innova? Yeah, grey Innova she just left. The Innova for eye doctor? -Doctor? -Yes, sir. If you ask at the reception you can get the details. Thanks. Sir, this is Dr. Chakradhar, Conference organizer. -Hello, sir-- -Hello, sir. Nice meeting you, sir. I am your die-hard fan, sir. I watched your film 'Missile' thrice, sir. Climax fight was-- Thank you, umm,,, You escorted a girl into an Innova just sometime ago. Dr Alekhya, sir. She is an eye doctor. Doctor, huh? Abhinav clinic in Uppal. -Are you well acquainted with her? -No, sir. I got introduced only here. She is quite reserved. I greeted her as she's beautiful. She asked me to arrange for a car. -I got cut out of the scene, sir. -Good riddance! Do you know the address of her clinic? -I know, sir. -He means, he wants to know the address. -Isn't appointment at 11:30 sharp? -11:30 Indian Standard Time. Can go at 12'o clock also. [laughs] -Alekhya, right? -Yes, of course. Chief Doctor James Kutty is also a big fan of yours. A Malayali who loves watching mass commercial movies. -Very rare case. -Let's go. Hey, careful... Okay, sir? Sir, I... I simply love your movies. -Your recent film 'Missile'... -Are you Kamala? Oh my God! Awesome! My eyes popped out of my head... -Wow! -Thank you. Spoken like a true eye specialist! Did your eyes get back into shape? Come on. Your Bose is very crazy, sir! You're very easy, huh? -Dr. Alekhya... Has she come? -Yes, she is there. -She's there. -Oh! Nice. -She's attending to another patient... -It's okay. She's almost done. Everyone makes a beeline to her. Oh! She is a star doctor then. Super star doctor! Looks like a cinema star. But... A bit moody. Sir, Dr Alekhya asked me to bring the patient. -Did you tell her he's a celebrity? -Yes, sir. She asked me, 'Does it mean his eyes are on top of his head?' Oh! This is going to be fun. -Please escort him -Yes, sir. Take him. -Sir? -Yes? Early morning I'm unable to open my eyes, sir. -Excuse me, ma'am? -Yes? -Thank you. -Please... -Hel-- -Sit in that chair. Hello, what is the problem? -You-- -Huh? I mean... My eyes. -What is the problem? -Now and then... My sight becomes dim. -Even now? -No, now somehow... My eyesight is... Crystal clear. From when it's happening? I think... I don't remember Do you work in front of the computer all the time? More in front of the iPad. But much more in front of the TV screen. Editing, shot checking... Oh! You're the celebrity director, right? Yeah. Naveen... You must have heard my name. Recently I made this film called Missile. Vivek, Sabiha as hero and heroine. Oh! -Are you that director? -Yeah, did you watch it? I have a kind of... ...allergy to cinema. I went because my colleagues compelled me. But... After 10 minutes, I walked out of the theater. Nah! Don't blink your eyes. Sorry. Okay Read those letters You are allergic to cinema? Is that what you see? Sorry V, F, N... N, E, H, Z, H, -D, R, P, R, F, N, E, V, Z... -Oh, okay. One minute. -Is this better? -Not much of a difference. Tell me, why do you find films-- Annoying... I find them boring and stupid. -Really? -Yeah. I feel it's a solid waste of time. Especially, films like your Missile. You didn't watch the film fully. I watched 2 of your films prior to this... By mistake. What were the names? Modhati Magaadu (The First man) After that, some silly title... Kasak? Yeah. Look at the board, sir. I give lengthy roles for my heroines in my films. V, F, N, N, E, H, Z, H. Longer their role shorter their skirts, right? -[choking] -Oh no! Do you need water? I'm... I'm okay Find any difference? Uh-huh! Same... Okay Please come. What else? Huh? Apply these drops thrice a day. You don't have any problem with your eyes. Oh! No problem, uh? No problem with your eyes. I think the problem lies in the way you 'look'! You'll be fine. Nice to meet you. [chuckles] Your phone number? What? Your mobile number? Sorry, sir... I don't share my personal number with random strangers. Okay. I'm sorry to ask you once more. Why do you have an allergy to cinema? Why should I tell you that? Because... I have something in my possession which belongs to you. And that is diametrically opposite to your so called allergy! It will prove your love for cinema. Really? What is it? [chuckles] [whistling] My phone number. Call me. We can enjoy a quiet dinner. I'll tell you then. Is this some kind of joke? Not at all, I'm dead serious. And very, very curious. Call me and... I won't reveal your secret to anyone, it is safe with me. Bye. [footsteps departs] [door creaks opens] [elevator chimes] Wonderful having you here, sir. -Thank You. -Eagerly waiting for your next movie. -Thank you so much. -Yes, sir. -Nice hospital, take care. -It will be my pressure. -Thank you. -Bye, sir. -Bye bye, see you. -Mr. Bose. -[laughs] -Kamala, let's go. Okay, sir -How did it go, sir? -Went off very well. Told her about the reel? -Did you spill the beans to Mr. Kutty? -Nah! I got myself a free eye check up. Generally I enquired about her. I think our dear Mr. Kutty is in the dark about her background. It seems he joked once with her about becoming an actress. She didn't talk to him for a week, sir. After that he didn't dare to bring it up again. But why didn't you tell her about the reel? Let me have some fun and then announce dramatically. -[gasps] -I've set a carrot as bait, let's see. You are not crude like the hero in your film... Naughty! [laughs] -Just marking them will do. -Okay. Talk of the angel! How come, back early today? -Josephine came just now. -Hey Jo. I finished all my appointments I thought I'll get home early. Why do you sound miffed? Nothing, maybe I'll feel better after I shower. Oh! Okay. Dad isn't back? -Right here. -There he is. I came home early I've even made coffee too. Coffee for you too. -Strong? -No need, dad. Hey! All okay? Yeah, totally. Let me shower. -And Jo... -Coffee? Have dinner with us, we can chat for a while. I'll stay if it's okay with aunty. -Jo! -Hey! Ah! He offered to return your belonging if you go out on a date with him? Yeah. Are you going? You think I'm desperate? Come on, dear. Be a sport. He's such a celebrity director. It will be fun and interesting. Not for me. He and his stupid movies! Romance is alien to these morons! Thinks his celebrity status will make girls fall like ninepins! Nothing like that, he makes good films. How do you even like his films? I put myself in the shoes of his hero. And imagine the hero in that dumb heroine's place. Done deal, you can enjoy the film thoroughly. That's all. You are crazy! I'm really curious to know... About your 'belonging' in his possession! Hey! This must be a cheap Valentine's Day trick. He must have got hold of a selfie I posted in my defunct FB account. That's the carrot he's dangling to wine, dine and flirt with me. Scoundrel! He thinks all girls are dumb and desperate like his film's heroines. Anyway take it in your stride. Didn't give him your number, right? -Of course not. -Huh. [mobile rings] [mobile vibrates and rings] -Hello? -Hello... Hi! Naveen here! Who gave you this number? There's nothing our film fraternity can't do! Right, except common sense and decency. We can earn that too. With your kind cooperation. What did you decide about our date? I have decided just now. Wow! -When and where? -Now and here. I decided to block your number. That is... Hello... Hello? -I don't believe this. -How did he get your number? He would have greased some nurse's palm in the clinic. Mr. Kutty will get an earful from me tomorrow. -Isn't this so unprofessional? -Yeah, yes. -Alekhya, Jo! Dinner ready. -Come... Let's go. I'm starving "Seems like many days have flown by since we played 3 cards, on a high" "Damn this Covid, months on end masked us and kept us locked" "How many days since we spread a mat, sat on the terrace, to dine and chat?" "My heart is parched It desires to be quenched" "You work from home anyway and if your heart wants to play" "Why don't you visit me when you can? Today or tomorrow, sounds like a plan" "O' visit me, handsome man" "Doors of my home are automatic" "O' Balaraja, come at 7 to weave magic" "Doors of my home are automatic" "O' Balaraja, come at 7 and make magic" "Buy me jasmine with love and care Just one cubit will do for my hair" "Why be extravagant and buy perfume fragrant?" "Don't bring cigarettes with you I hate that blessed stink, dude" "Sit beside me and breathe in gentle, cool breeze blowing" "You pinch my cheek with your ring finger You are a dead ringer for my dream lover" "My bangles are so lucky to drum on your chest to our love-rhythm" "Let us show off anew the fusion of our hearts true" "Let us tickle the moon above watching us swoon with love" "Come and unite in this dance of delight" "Automatic" "Automatic" "Automatic" "Auto..." "Doors of my home are automatic" "O' Balaraja, come at 7 to weave magic" "Doors of my home are automatic" "O' Balaraja, come at 7 to weave magic" Bose, why isn't Naveen focusing on this song shoot? Thank your stars, sir... If you see where he has actually focused and shot. You will sell all the areas in a jiffy. Are you teaching me the business? Sir, look at that chick. -Where? -There. -From Mumbai or local? -Let's find out, sir. "Here she is, hitting on you. Have a ball, say yes, dude" "Let's chat through the night. Make our move, that's right" "I've been waiting too long" He bunked the song shoot though she didn't give a damn. You see, he gathered more details about that girl he wanted as the heroine. But like the hero in his film... He could've gone to her house directly... Held her against her bedroom wall. And told her about the reel and ended this torture. [scoffs] Although you are in this industry for 20 years... You know why you haven't become a director yet? Ah... That's because... I thought my first producer's wife was the heroine and I told him, 'she is a real peach'. He replied, 'You'll get it from me'. -Career out. -Really? I didn't know that episode, but what I do know is... Bose doesn't know drama! Out of the blue I found a film clip of a breathtakingly beautiful girl. I met that girl. I wanted to launch her as the heroine in my film but... Bang! She hates even the word 'cinema'. She detests especially my films! -Oh! -Fascinating, right? I am a creative fellow, Bose. Not just in cinema I need drama in real life too. I must know a bit more about that girl. Spend quality time with her. Invite her home Show her that reel I stumbled upon. And watch her reaction face to face. Then I have to find out her actual problem... -Slowly convince her...-Right there... In that very home theater, in her most vulnerable moment... -Launch her. -Damn you! Dump your sick mind in the sea. This is the difference between cheap thinking and script writing, Ramana. Without adding my cheap thinking to your script writing, you think you would've given so many hits, sir? He has a point. Shut up, both of you. Setting aside cheap scripting, Let us try right thinking. -That means? -From a different angle. -Let's tackle her. -Which angle? What is it? How... Hello? -[humming] -Handle this smoothly. Order a smoothie, sir. Happily for yourself. -I am unstoppable. -He sounds confident. -Yes? -Sir... This person wants to meet you, sir. Come in please. Kindly take a seat. -How are you, sir? -All well, sir. Tell me? I want to open an account, sir. What account? You know, sir... You have accounts, right? Savings account? You don't have to meet me to open a savings account, sir. Ask Prasanna madam over there... She can take care of it. Not just that, I wanted to talk to you too. Oh! Tell me please. Your office is real cool. -Beautiful. -Thank you. Do you give it for film shoots? -Cinema, huh? -Cinema, sir... Film on screen... Buy tickets. -Samosa and popcorn-- -I know, sir... Cinema? When my previous manager agreed for a film shoot, film unit made a mess of the place. We had security issues also. After I took over, I had to spruce up everything. Sorry, sir, we don't give for film shoots. Sir, we won't mess it up. -We are very carefu- -I know, sir... I know only too well about you 'cinema' people. I've seen it all. You've labeled us wrong. We aren't that evil, sir! It's alright, if you give me your phone number I'll call you later. If any formalities have to be met we have a budget to cover that. Financially plus a photo shoot with your family. Hey! Watch your tongue! This is why I hate you cinema people. If you want to open an account, go to Ms. Prasanna, otherwise out you go... His 'get out' felt like a sharp stab, sir. What exactly did you tell him? What's there to tell? As soon as he said 'I hate you cinema people'. I was so put off, I said 'tell me if you expect anything', that's all. -That's the point. -Exactly! Not point, we must poison him. He really insulted me. Sir, I'll use all my clout and I'll get the permission to shoot. Write the scene with this very bank in mind. Not just a scene but entire Money Heist series! -Bloody hell! -Don't lose your cool, Bose. This is for our research. Not for our film. Let's forget your faux pas for a second. It's clear her dad hates films too. All an act, sir, it is fashionable now to hate the film fraternity. Drool over the film. Deride the film maker! Okay, let's go to another place. [engine starts] Let's go some place peaceful-- Where to? MANGALA PUBLISHERS PUBLISHERS & SELLERS 'Bank Father Bhakti Mother', Keep that as our next film's title! It will end this jinx for sure. Good, Bose. Sounds original. Don't make fun of me, sir. Wonder what this woman will say, God help me! Excuse me, madam. -Greetings, madam. -Tell me? Er... I am coming from Jubilee Hill-- -Okay -God's offering... Our office code... Only after they apply 'kumkum' we do anything for our customers. Anything, eh? Rachamamba madam, Vishnu Maya's cover page. -Balaji sir sent this. -Okay... Okay. -Is your name Rachamamba, madam? -Yes. [laughing] Sorry... Unique name, madam. Who chose this name, madam? By birth or by growth? -Who named you, madam? -My school teacher. He wrote R. Achamamba as Rachamamba, idiot! That's why on the last day of school, I splashed ink on his shirt and made a great escape. You splashed ink on his shirt and scooted? Same scene is in Tamil film '96'. -You can sue them on copyright issue. -Really? Anyway who are you? My name is Bose, madam. Where are you coming from? From Jubilee Hills, madam. To ask permission for shooting -Cinema, huh? -Yeah. -Where? -Why will I come here then? -Right here. -Here, huh? 'Same spot' -Whom are you talking to, Rachamamba? -Sumithra, madam... Sumithra-- Good morning, madam My name is Bose -Can I have a word with you? -Tell me? Your office is very impressive, madam. Thank you. If you'll permit a film shoot here, I was just asking Rachamam-- Hey! This expression seems so familiar, madam. I can't recollect right now. What happened, Bose? 'The dirty world of cinema', 'cast & crew' 'and their despicable lives.' 'I hate them all.' 'Your face is a perfect replica of all that'. 'Get out!' 'Don't ever come back here.' 'This isn't a mere piece of advice...' 'It is a warning!' [both laughs] I didn't realize my face was that expressive till she told me so, sir. Only when you meet people who can judge you 100%... -do you learn some bitter truths, Bose. -Ah? So this family is allergic to cinema. You mean to say just because I hate bank and bank employees and Bhakti books and their publishers. -Will you make a film about me? -Yes, we can... There is no story without conflict. This is not a conflict, this is an affliction. -Oh, is it? -Haven't I said this isn't for our film? This isn't getting us anywhere. Let's make a new plan. As a surprise attack. Surprise attack, huh? What have we been doing till now? Another new idea, huh? It is this sharpness I admire the most in Bose! 'If it isn't yours, you can dash-dash...' I guess you believe that Telugu proverb. -Oh! 'Dash-dash' means? -Fill in the blanks. Sumi, I was just getting ready for the conference and this idiot turns up. I mean, can you believe it? He said the word 'Formalities'. -Really? -Yes, this morning. -What are you talking about? -Something strange happened today. I had a visitor from the film field this morning. Wanted to know if I allowed shooting in the bank. When I told him 'Sorry, I don't permit'. He said, 'Sir, give me your phone number I'll call later and convince you'. I shooed him out with a loud 'Get out'. -He came to my office too. -Is that so? How do you know it is the same person? The moment I described him your amma immediately placed him. Then my staff member told me... -Some director's name... Naveen! -Hmm. He makes trashy films it seems. What were the titles? Missile, Kasak... This chap is his assistant. -It's okay, Mano. -Ruined my morning and my mood! I'm so repulsed by this I have to first go and shower. Mano... Coffee? After I finish my bath I will have it. -You freshen up too, I'll make coffee. -Hmm... Hey! That director's assistant went to my dad and mom's office and asked for permission to shoot. -Really? -Yeah! Looks like you've got him falling head over heels! What a creep! I should complain to the police! Will you complain he asked for permission to shoot? He'll try a few times and give up of his own accord, chill. You aren't interested, right? What? I mean, does he appeal to you... Hey, are you mad? Better to clarify, no? Shut up! I promised my parents long ago... I'll marry only the groom they choose for me. They know what is best for me I fully trust them. And I don't have time for this kind of nonsense. Oh my god! How often have I heard this line! Many of my friends swore like this and ended up happily marrying the same guy they called a creep! Something very romantic about that I think. -I'm sure, you'll also-- -Shucks! [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [vehicle honks] [slurps] Wow! My personal favorite... Chocolate cake. -Thank you -You've added that, no? -[chuckles] -[chuckles] Thank you. How is it? -Mmm... -Mmm. I think in your hospital everyone talks with their eyes, right? -[tuts] Mr. Bose... -Grrrr! Why this formality of 'Mr'? Just say 'Bose' in your beautiful bass voice -Bose... -[groans] -[chuckles] -Tell me now? You'll get me a chance to act, won't you? My biggest dream is to be seen at least in one scene in a film. Do you know I've been dreaming of your acting debut since we met? I'm a dreamer... [laughs] And by the way, I never forget a promise I've made till my last breath. You mean I won't get a break till you breathe your last? [laughs] -Minx! -Hey! Sorry. No CC cameras I hope... I don't think so. We can audition you tomorrow. Oh no! I'm not free tomorrow or the day after. Our hospital is participating in an eye-donation camp, along with 4 other hospitals. Not my fault-- -Eye-donation camp? -Hmm... -Will all the doctors attend? -Hmm. -Mr. James Kutty? -Hmm... -Alekhya madam? -Err! Alekhya madam was the one who planned this. Where does Mr. Kutty live? [humming] "You are wonderful, wow! Such a gem of a man, bravo!" -"I am a slave now" -Hey! Hey, Bose. "Of your machismo" What is this, in broad daylight? I am not like that! -Is it okay for you if I come at night? -Wicked fellow! -What else have you done? -Why are you closing the door? Hence you bring a change to the world. This is the 6th Eye Donation Camp run by us in the past 1 year. And each one of them had a great response. I'm sure with the co-operation... ...and the enthusiastic participation of all of you. This drive will be a grand success. [camera capturing] [crowd applausing] Thank you, Alekhya. To inaugurate our Eye Donation drive today. [camera capture] Let me invite a dynamic man with a drive for success. A 'happening' director. I request Mr. Naveen to come on to the stage. Welcome, sir. [crowd applauses] Namaste! Hello! -That was a grand entry, sir. -Thank you... Thank you. Oh! This is for you, please take your-- Greetings. Greetings. [crowd continues applauses] All good? I hate making speeches on stage or doling out free advice, all of you know that very well. [camera capture] I am grateful to Mr. Kutty and Ms. Alekhya for inviting me here. Thank you. [camera capture] I kept saying 'no' but the organizers insisted. I had to honor their invitation. Anyway I'm here for a noble cause. I don't know how to dream without eyesight. I feel the visually impaired are the true heroes. But those who can see this beautiful world... ...see more beautiful dreams, right? If we should share our dreams with everyone ...we must share our eyes with everyone too, right? So suppose I suddenly... [snickers] Kick the bucket. I request Mr. Kutty and Ms. Alekhya to donate my eyes to someone. [camera capture] From today... My eyes... Belong to you. Yeah, thank you. [crowd applausing] Nice to meet you people here. -Thank you and-- -Excuse me... Not just his eyes... A sum of Rs. 20 million, Mr. Naveen has donated to this program. Two crores! Give him a big hand! Big hand! Thank you so much, sir. Why did you have to say this, sir? -So kind of you. -Thank you. -Thank you... Thank you. -You've organized the event well. Thank you. We have another drive next month. Of course, I'll definitely come. -Hello, sir. -Hi! -Love your movies. -Thank you... Thank you. See you, Alekhya. Great initiative. -Thank you. -Bye. Bye, sir. Bye. Looks like you are super mad at me. [sighs] Like in your films helping orphan kids cross the road... and donating excess money to charity, won't impress me. Even to make you flip for me, I can't make a great sacrifice like donating my eyes. I love my eyes. I donated my eyes to make sure they don't go waste. -Hi, Mr. Naveen! -Hi. -Hi, Rajitha. Hi, Ashok. -Hi, Alekhya. Rajitha is also an eye doctor. -Ashok is in software. -Oh! Hello! We love your movies, sir. I'll make more, ma'am... Please continue enjoying! We came up to you to thank you, sir. -To me? -Mmm. Why thank me? Alekhya knows... We lost our son in an accident 6 months ago. I'm... Really sorry to hear that. Sometimes even though we are doctors... We are unable to save our loved ones. He was a big fan of yours. Before he passed away... A dialog from 'Modhati Magaadu' got imprinted in his heart. 'Just living your life as you wish, that isn't really living...' 'Even after you die if you live,' 'that is your true life.' That particular line... He just loved it. Before he passed away, he insisted we should donate his organs... As his last wish. [sobs] I'm... Sorry. We don't have access generally to celebrities. As soon as I saw you I wanted to come over and thank you. Rajitha madam, I am-- I don't deserve... This. I just churn out commercial movies. No, sir. You make films based on some ideas. Garnish it with many ingredients for the sake of entertainment. But... One such dialog is enough, isn't it? To inspire a 12 year old boy? That's why my husband and I... ...always attend any camp like this. Somehow... Whatever little we can contribute-- [sobbing] Sir, in your interviews. You used to wear a bandana. After watching you He bought a similar bandana, sir. Lovely boy, sir. We miss him a lot. But... He has given so many people a new lease of life... ...which gives us a spark of joy, sir. Only thanks to you! Thank you, sir. Thank you so much! Thank you. Only now I realize I have some value too. -First time. -No. It's our honor. Sorry, you were conversing and we disturbed you. No... Not at all. Thank you. -We'll get going. -See you, sir. Bye, Alekhya. Come. You bet I planned everything else to meet you. But I didn't plan this, Alekhya. Audience is amazing, right? They can find something good even in trash! Your dialog that boy loved, it doesn't seem so trashy! Thank you. Actually it isn't my intention to trouble you like this. No, I know. I came to give you this. Don't worry, this is... This isn't... A silly gift. Please. Go home and open this. If you still feel like meeting me, call me. If you don't, I will-- I'll never bother you. I'll conclude you don't need what's in my possession. I'll delete your number permanently. Thank you. 'If my dream is destroyed...' 'It is as good as killing myself!' Sumi, I'm making coffee. Has Aloo come back? Came just a while ago... Said she had a headache and didn't want to be disturbed. -Okay, for you? -Yeah, half cup is enough. [crying] [mobile ringing] Hello? What is... Your address? -Hi! -Hi. Thanks for coming Come... Come. Please come in. Come, sit. Please sit. -Ready? -Hmm. [sobbing] [inaudible] -[sobbing] -[inaudible] Wha... What happen? Hey! Alekhya, what happened? I'm sorry... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. I was just... -I am curious. -[sobs] When you've done such a good job... Why do you have such an aversion to cinema? That's it. The note you sent in the can... The lines you wrote. I just did a lip-sync for a dialog in the rush, that's all. I'll show you, watch. 'If my dream is destroyed...' 'It is as good as me killing myself!' I just dubbed over your voice, that's all. That isn't my voice. Sorry? I did not speak those words. Then? The girl on the screen... Isn't me. Wha... What? She is... She is my elder sister... Akhila. My twin. My sister. AA AMMAYI GURINCHI MEEKU CHEPPALI (I Must Tell You About That Girl) My sister loved acting right from childhood. Weak, defenceless, dependent. Only when weak is one called a weakling. I am not a weakling I am a strong woman. My word is my command... Whether a chieftain or a commander... In the end, be it even one's husband. They have no other option but to bow to our monarchy. If anyone dares to disobey and raises his head in dissent. ...his head will fall to the ground. That's all! [crowd cheering and applauses] I was at your daughter's school drama. She was simply brilliant, sir. We have a small role... -for a young girl in our film... -Oh! No... No, sir. We're not interested. That school play was just a cultural program. We are a traditional conservative family. Very talented, sir. -Please, sir. -I know, I know. But all talents can't be pursued, right? Please don't misunderstand me. But thank you for the compliment. Okay, sir... I'll take leave. It's okay. "Come, my little queen" "Welcome' says the silver screen" -"Like a beautiful dream of rosy delight" -Go... Go... Go! -"Like the shimmering sky so bright" -Hey... [inaudible] Ah... Nature... -Dad, smile please. -Nah! I'll take yours... [camera captures] I am afraid all this is... ...but a dream. Too flattering sweet to be substantial. Think, if your love be pure your purpose marriage? It is, my lady. Then all my fortunes at your feet I lay and follow you, my lord, throughout the world. Juliet! My lady? A 1000 times good night. A 1000 times the worse to miss your light. Romeo... Juliet. -Boss, kiss her! -We want kiss. -Dude, don't miss this chance. -[crowd whistles and applauses] She is really hot! Kiss her, come on! -Dad! -No means 'no'. Don't you get what I'm saying? Do you know how ashamed we felt with your intimate scenes in public? -But, dad... It's just a play! -It's just a play. -But no! -Mom? I don't like it! Mom, I love acting. Akhila, we'll forget what happened today. You heard your dad, right? Put a full stop to this. We don't like it. -But why? -Because... I said so! -But---We are a dignified family. If you ever bring up cheap professions like acting. I will kill you! -Sister... -Hmm? You were great as Juliet. Thank you. -Really? -You know what? -I've watched it many times. -How cannot you? -We can keep it as a reference. We can. -That's what. Hey Aloo, come here. This is my younger sister, Alekhya. Twin. -Hi! -Hi. And he is Deepak... My friend. -Future director. -[chuckles] Wow! She's your carbon copy. [all chuckles] -You want some coffee? -No, I'm good. -Hey! Shall we tell our story to her? -Yeah... Yeah. -Huh... So, it's called... -Tell me? -'I Must Tell You About That Girl'. -"The waves of magic lure you" Are you serious? -Really? -"For some strange reason anew" Dream come true, uh? See you tomorrow morning, bye. Aloo! Deepak has got a chance to direct a film. I am the heroine. Really? Silence! Clap! By 5, Take 1! Action! -Hey! -And cut! What is this? -Ah! -Hey! Sir... Sir. -Come! -Please, hear me out just once, sir. -Sir, let me explain... -Come on! -Dad! -Hey! -Sir-- -Shut up! -Come home now! -Please listen to me, sir. [gasps] [pants] Huh! [things clattering] -Are you mad? -Yes, I'm mad! You don't have to put up with me any longer. I'm an actress, I want to act! I am leaving only because you find it humiliating. -Sister? -Akhila? Mom... [clapping] [music mutes voices] Mano, don't do this. -Don't stop me, Sumithra! -What is this, Mano? -How dare she! -Mano, just calm down. -How dare she-- -Mano, listen to me. She is just a child. -She acted on impulse rashly! -She rejected us for a nobody and even married him. When people asked me I had to bow my head in shame. We've lost our dignity and self respect. She is inside. Okay. Deepak's producer and his family died in a tragic accident. His film is stalled. -What? -Hmm. The blame fell on Deepak. Deepu brought bad luck it seems. Those who were jealous of him are reveling in false propaganda. Deepu has drowned himself in depression. And I don't know what to do. [mobile vibrates and rings] Hello? Sister? What happened, sister? What?! [crowd indistinct chattering] [sobbing] [sobbing] In order to get over that shock... My dad felt the only option was to get transferred to another city. He got a job transfer to Noida. In the Press and Media... He somehow made sure my twin's name was not tagged along with Deepak. But... But my sister couldn't get over her tragic loss. Sister? What happened, sister? Are you okay? You'll be alright. -Mom... Dad. -Yeah? -Guess what? -What? I topped! -Wonderful, dear. -I knew you would do it. Congrats, baby. -I'm so happy. -Where's sister? -She's inside, go. -I'll go and tell her. -She'll do her MS at AIIMS. -Isn't it? All India Institute... Sister? Sister! -Sister! -[gasps] [music mutes voices] My dad didn't want a transfer back to this city... He tried his best to avoid it. He wasn't successful. We had to come. Mr. James over here, asked me to practice at his clinic. So... That's how-- Even now if he hears the very word 'cinema'... Or any reference to that world. My dad gets hysterical. My mom too. [mobile rings] I have to go. I lied to my parents I had an emergency case and came here. Mr. Naveen... Whatever you are thinking, no chance at all of it happening... You must have realized it by now. So please understand. It is better... We don't meet again. Thank you. -Is sir inside? -Yes, sir. -Shoot was cancelled. -Oh! Okay. This is my next film. -Akhila's story. -Who is Akhila? Alekhya's twin. She is not alive. She is dead. Really? Just imagine... Akhila's husband... Shoots for 4 days and the film stalls. One film-can alone ends up in some corner in a studio. Travels all over the city... 6 years later lands in a scrap disposal dump. Undamaged and intact the rushes drop into my hands. [chuckles] 'Destiny's magic hand' you think poet Athreya's words were meaningless? Will you be my co-writer? For this story? If I get scared or lose my way... Only you can chide me and steer me through. But... Will Alekhya agree to play Akhila? Alekhya... Hearing what I'm about to say you, you don't get mad at me. Don't be shocked either. Whatever it is... I must tell the world this story. Akhila's story. So, I can't do the film I am doing now and... Akhila's character-- Only you can do that. What?! Do you realize what you're asking me? -How can you be so insensitive and-- -Hold on... Hold on... Just listen to me once. I came into this film industry when I was just 22. I wasn't academically inclined. So I really struggled for a long time. As assistant director. At that time I fell in love with a girl. -Look, this is your personal-- -No, no... -Your personal things... -No...no, just listen-- I don't want to listen to all your personal details. This is important, please hear me out. First love! It was great. Her dream was to become an actress. She was struggling to get a break. I promised I would launch her in my film if I got a break. And I was... ...lucky enough to get that break. A successful producer. Renowned banner. I suggested my girlfriend's name and he said no problem. But he had only one condition... He said she has to... Sleep with him. Just imagine. Biggest break of my career. The girl I loved more than my life. Producer's condition... On the spot I said 'no' and returned to my room. I met her that evening. She insisted I should tell her why I looked so disturbed. I told her. 'No... No a big deal' she said. She said, 'My passion to become an actor is strong as yours to become a director' 'I knew one day I must face the reality of the casting couch'. 'So I decided long ago'. 'I am... I am ready' she said. 'What about us?' I asked her. 'Naveen, I love you But this is--' 'Pro... Professional decision.' 'Don't latch on to such silly sentiments and ruin your career' she said. I didn't know what to do. My whole world... Turned pitch black. For 2-3 days... I wandered around like a mad man. I... I wanted to commit suicide. I decided to write a suicide note to my parents... My eyes fell on the newspaper I had kept as a pad for my note. YOUNG DIRECTOR COMMITS SUICIDE It's about Akhila's husband Deepak and how he took his own life. YOUNG DIRECTOR COMMITS SUICIDE Don't know why as soon as I read this news... Something snapped in me. Why should I be a piece of rag the world has cast aside? Why should I be a piece of paper no one wants to read? A fury raged within me. That very moment, I decided to live. I decided to live on my own terms and make the world bow to my success. I tore my suicide note to bits. After that, Mr Fancy Parameswar gave me the break I needed. Like I was avenging a hidden enemy I churned out commercial films. I gave hit after hit. But now it dawned on me... If Deepak hadn't taken his life. I... I wouldn't even be alive today. His dream died and my dream got resurrected. Ms. Alekhya... Till now I was selling my soul and making commercial films. For the first time, I want to make a film trusting my heart. I must revive Deepak's dream because it gave me a new life. This is my way of thanking him, a tribute. I must do this. And... Deepak's dream is meaningless without Akhila. And only you can make Akhila's dream worthwhile. I'm not say-- I'm not saying this with a selfish agenda, Alekhya. Ms. Alekhya... If you do this... It will be the best gift... For your twin Akhila. Ideal way to make her soul rest in peace. Trust me. Please let's do this. You should leave. Happy 19th birthday, Aloo. You like the card? I love it. Aloo, what will you do if I suddenly die? What rubbish! Hey! Just for fun, tell me. If you die I'll die too. Fat hopes you have! Why? Show me your right hand. You and I are the same. Do you know why we were born identical? To complete whatever the other has left half done. So if I leave something half done you have to complete it for me. Hello? Mr Naveen! Yeah, hi. Tell me I will-- I'll do it. Huh? I'm prepared to act In your film As Akhila. -Hello? -Yeah...yeah Thank you, Alekhya But one condition. -Tell me. -No one should know I'm acting. It should be kept a secret. -Okay? -Done. Bye. YES! Yeah... wah! -Hello? -Hello, Bose. What's up, sir? Have you found your hero in the trash can this time? Shut up! Alekhya agreed. Agreed, huh? For what? Dirty mind! Come home in half an hour I just can't believe this. Sir, actually this is top secret. Even if my eyes are gouged I won't whisper a word. It's a promise. I'll manage your schedule to ensure this works out for you. Thank you! Entire shooting is here. House, hospital everything is here. Remember what I said, If the news of our shoot here leaks out... I'll hold the Guinness record for maximum murders. I'm not joking, I'm serious... Hello, if you hide your mobile from me, Birthday suit bashing will be the result. Not mine, yours! Excellent! Thank you. May be... If you wore a simple chain, I think you'll look great. My sister was never fond of jewelry. Of course, yeah. Come. -All set? -Yeah, ready, sir. This is-- I know. -Deepak's parents. -I wanted them to inaugurate my film. Thank you very much. Our son's soul will truly rest in peace. Sir, can you keep our shoot a secret? -Hey, Bose. -Don't worry It's a top secret. Thank you, sir. Ready? When I say 'Roll camera' press this button. -Roll Camera. -Best of luck! [voices muted] "O' from far, if your eyes and you..." "Keep looking at me, what can I do?" "O' if your love-play mellows me and..." "I talk to my inner self freely. What do I say then really?" "Listen to my long lasting wish" "With your sweet & short smile I relish" "Simply say 'yes' with a flourish" "That single word so precious will break barriers between us" "Even though this feeling is new to me I feel heady, brow to toe truly" "As time goes by; gradually I will like it even more probably" "Though it is a new experience for you it feels very good in every sense true" "As time goes by; gradually you'll like it even more, trust me" "O' from far, if your eyes and you..." "Keep looking at me, what can I do?" "O' if your love-play mellows me and I talk to my inner self freely..." "What do I say then really?" "Now that our thoughts are in sync why does your face still blush pink?" "I fill the empty alcove of your heart with my love" "I stepped up our level of intimacy It is better than before, you see" "Baby steps to a lifetime of ecstasy" "Haa...! Without you..." "Without you beside me, dear..." "Won't the morning sun be sulkier?" "O... In every dream that dances into my sleep" "Images of you make an impact deep" "Even though this feeling is new to me I feel heady, brow to toe truly" "As time goes by; gradually I will like it even more probably" "Though it is a new experience for you it feels very good in every sense true" "As time goes by; gradually you will like it even more, trust me" "No clue how time sped by double quick" "All thanks to your charisma; pure magic" "I'll never forget this joy-filled journey" "Everything is sweet as honey to me" "Aaa... In my heart's atrium" "This is the moment in my heart's atrium..." "our souls bask together in the solarium" "Entwined emotionally in this birth, for you and me" "The word 'love' blooms beautifully blossoming in our hearts eternally" "Even though this feeling is new to me I feel heady, brow to toe truly" "As time goes by; I am sure we'll share a rosy future" "We share our dream of friendship equal in love and kinship" "On the tips of our fingers our love forever lingers" "Hearts never to part, unwavering like the flag of love swaying" "With your lover intertwine forever" -You take it first. -Thanks, sir. You are compelling me What about you? That's for you, I don't want. -Please take. -Don't be formal in my house. Alekhya, come... come. Come... come. Surya, Kalpana, childhood friends, My Delhi gang I used to mention, right? They have shifted to Hyderabad now. Alekhya, this is.. -Namaste! -Varun from CCMB, he is a scientist. -Oh. -Alekhya... -Hi -Their son. Hi! Even if you didn't speak much to me for more than half an hour, You smiled 6 times in between, That's good enough for me. [chukles] This is the 7th time. I can't believe you are an eye doctor. Why? You look more like a movie star. [coughs] You okay? Yeah, I mean-- No, I-- I mean, I am not interested in cinema. In fact... Even my entire family. Yeah, I know. My dad told me. I'm really sorry about your sister. No... that's okay. It's been a long time. Wonder how much they got acquainted! Hey Varun, shall we leave? It's 10'o clock. Finished your chat? Whatever I prepared as of now is over. More next time? Hmmm... sure. Aren't they wonderful? Surya's family? Even Varun. Such a sweet boy! -Yeah -They wanted to set you up with Varun. Huh? Meaning? To ask if you'll marry Varun. Amma... Why suddenly right now? I don't even know anything about him. We don't easily find a partner of our choice when we want, When you get you must just latch on -Like I grabbed your mother. -Shut up! I need some time, dad. Of course! We just want you to spend time and get to know him. He's a nice guy, You'll like him. You trust us, don't you? Of course, father. You have promised us We haven't forgotten that. Neither have I. She looks tired. Let her sleep, let's go, Sumi. -Bye... Bye. -Good night. Good night. [mobile ringing] -Hello? -Hi! Why at this late hour? I just saw the rushes, So good. And... you look great. Thank you. Hey! Why do you sound so dull? All okay? Yeah, I'm... Fine. No...! Something is troubling you. I can sense it in your voice. My parents have chosen a groom for me. They want me to get married. Oh! -When? -Just a while ago... They came over for dinner. The groom's name is... Varun... he is a Scientist. What? Groom? Have they fixed... the wedding date too? That's how they are behaving, They are waiting for me to say 'okay'. Then... Will you say 'yes'? That isn't so easy, right? Why? As if I don't have my own problems? What are they? First problem. I have to finish your film, right? Yeah... isn't that so? Is it okay then? Won't it delay the wedding? That's what even I'm thinking, It's kind of obvious Varun likes me too. He said I look like a movie star. Wow! Will he be able to handle it if he knows that's the truth? Most husbands want their wife to be a star only for them. They can't even handle it if others admire their wife. Beware of that. No... no, Varun is really an understanding type. He won't mind if I act after we are married... I'm sure. Hmmm... okay... Congrats! Hello! I haven't said 'yes' to him. Why wait? Say 'yes' to him Didn't I say my first problem is to finish the film for you? Did I tell you my 2nd problem? What is that? I'll tell you when I see you tomorrow, I'm too sleepy now. You've disturbed my sleep, tell me. That is-- Not something I can tell over the phone. Tell you tomorrow. Good night. Good night. [indistinct chatter] Madam, shot ready. Okay. Go inside, madam. Kamala, please go in. Come. Let's start. All ready? Namaste, sir. Come, bro, adjust it later on. First stand on this mark.

Loosen up It's his debut, madam. This doctor is good, who is he? -Nice to meet you -Works in CCMB, He's mad about acting... Told him about the secret pact, new guy, so made him promise. Being a scientist I knew he would get the medical terms right. Wondering if he can act? Anyway you will sharpen his acting ability. It's a case of clinical depression, sir. It's a bit severe, he is under sedation -We must wait for 2 days, you should-- -Shot... After the director calls out 'action'. Shot. Oh! Okay... okay.

Mr Varun is Alekhya's family friend. -Didn't tell me, you tight-lipped fellow! -Ouch! Very close. -Getting married. -Secretiv-- I swear I didn't know, sir. Being a scientist I thought he'll get the English medical terms right. Good selection, Bose. Very good! Good selection! -Is the next set-up ready? -I really didn't know, sir. Next set-up?

I've come at the right time - Drink? - No... no. Why shut down your laptop? Just continue your work. I'm in no mood to work. Why? What happened? If I knew that won't I be in a good mood? Listen. You know something? We think we are making a movie, but sometimes the movie makes us! Shows us our true self. What we are missing in life? And what we really want... It reveals to us. That's the power of movie making. In a way... It feels good. But... Theres a flip side to it too. We tend to forget what the film requires... And run behind our own desires. I know what you're going through. But don't forget your purpose behind starting this project. If you do, you'll risk losing everything. Cheer up, buddy. No! I know why you started this movie. I am aware how much I mean to you. There isn't any risk involved. I am with you. I love you! Let's do this. Thank you so much! Ah... cut. Let's break for 10 minutes. Get the next set-up ready. -Excuse me. -Yeah, sure. Hey! -Yeah? -Are you okay? Why? Nothing specific. You've been rather distant today. Like morning, I noticed it even during our first shot today. Nothing in particular. I wanted to concentrate on my work. Instead of focusing on unnecessary stuff. What unnecessary stuff? Whatever isn't necessary for the film. 10 minutes, I'll be back. To watch the shoot... who? She is related to me, just wanted to watch a shoot. Nagging me to death since a week. Mr. Bose isn't here, went out on some important work. She'd better come when he's here, Ravi. We can inform him later. She knows Bose sir. Please come. Come in. You've got the line? -Don't talk to anyone. -Sure. You'll come and tell her the film is stalled. She expresses shock, okay? -Let's go for a take, huh? -Ready. Yeah, let's do it. Everybody in position? Clap in. -Roll sound. -Sound rolling. -Roll camera. -Rolling sir. 139/1, take 1. Action. Akhila! Our film is stalled. -What? -Yeah. What happened? Our producer Mr Ramaraju, And his family died in an accident this morning. It... it's over. Cut. Something is not working. Well try one more. It is slightly over the top. -What happened?-Well try. Your positions. Ready? Okay. Weirdo! Hey Rachamamba madam. What a surprise! Nothing, dear. I just had some work. How are you? See you. Mother... Father. What happened? Is it true? Is this true? -Father, let me explain. Listen to me. -Shut up! I didn't do anything wrong, dad. I'm doing this... For my elder sisiter's sake. What? For your sisters sake? Sumi, heard what she said? For your sister? For Akhila's sake? She committed the same mistake, She walked out on us and married some random fellow... He died and left her high & dry... Turning her life into hell and driving her to commit suicide. You claim you are doing this for her? Aren't you ashamed to say so? You might as well kill us both. And fulfil your cheap filmy desires. -Amma? -Don't you dare open your mouth. I'll kill you. Sumi! She has joined hands with that rogue of a film director. The one who came to my bank and to your office asking for permission Yes or no? YES OR NO? I don't know that. Shut up! Do you think we are fools? Eh... Disgusting! You know what we went through? First she walked out of the house two years ago. After her husband died, how we struggled to bring her life back to normalcy. Unable to forget she is no longer alive. Now she follows her twins footstep. What sin did we commit to go through this all over again? She too went through her own hell, dad. Her intention was never to make you unhappy. Your intention isn't that either. We are upset for no reason, huh?! She wanted to be an actress. It was her dream. I don't care for that dream. Do you understand? I don't care. I CARE! I care. Because I know. Akhila... You know her only as your daughter. Not as a sister. To know her like that, You have never made an effort. Your fears... Your sense of false prestige... Your ego... Swept my sister into oblivion. How dare you! How dare you! Her death must have a purpose. The world need's to know her story. Her story? That means our familys story. On the pretext of telling your sister's story, You want to drag the dignity of our family onto the streets? Alekhya, if you act in this film, You will end up seeing... Our dead bodies! Sumi! Alekhya! Alekhya! Alekhya... don't go. Alekhya! Alekhya! She has come just now, aunt. Tell that stupid girl. She's behaving like a lunatic. I think only our death will put an end to this damn jinx. Why are you getting agitated, aunt? I'll talk to her. You dont worry, I'll take care. Please relax. What? How did that lady come to our set? I don't know, but... My parents are very upset. They said if I act they will kill themselves. Hey Alekhya, listen. Don't worry... Well think of something. I... Don't think I can do it anymore. Hey! It's... okay. Relax, alright? I'm very sorry. Don't show your wretched face to me. Sorry, sir. To think our own team was responsible for this... pah! What if you try once to talk to her parents? Asking someone to taste mango pickle when he's suffering from acidity! They will chop him to pieces and deliver him through Swiggy! "A story running smooth on oiled wheels, he has put a spoke in the reels" "A life secured safely, he has torn apart strangely" "A story running smooth on oiled wheels, he has put a spoke in the reels" "A life secured safely, he has torn apart strangely" "After pinching the baby rocking the cradle with His lullaby" "God get's a special kick with his humor unique!" "In the cool comfort of the moons nightly sport" "He kindled a fire within with raging flames hidden" "In the life of this lovely girl" Alekhya! Can I take you out for dinner tonight? I can't come. Okay. "In this endless entanglement" "When will chaos give way to contentment?" "Like writing on water vanishes" "Disparate hearts, he forges the fun from afar, he watches" "Having already painted an image tall on the walls of this heart so small" "He plays his divine games, what gall!" "Showcasing at night kaleidoscopic dreams of delight" "He ends his magic at dawn and before you know, he's gone" "Having his impish last laugh, this is God's blind mans buff" "In the life of this lovely girl" "Chaos is whirling into a swirl" -Here, sir -What is it? Advance you gave for our film. Are you returning my own money?! This is your dream project. Find a way to finish it. Go... go now, I'm not as commercial as you think. "When will chaos give way to contentment?" [voice muted] DIRECTOR NAVEENS SPICED UP SEX GAMES This... For this reason... Respectable and dignified families... Do not send their daughters into the sleazy film world. You may have read it too? My colleague showed this and asked me, This is your daughter, right? Someone asked your mother too. Do we have to bow our heads in shame? First your sister and now you. Your mother-- For the torture my wife and I are facing because of you. I came to thank you personally. Hello, madam, how are you? Who wrote that gossip about Naveen and me in that trashy website? Which one, madam? There are so many. I'll send it to you. DIRECTOR NAVEENS SPICED UP SEX GAMES -This is mudslinging, madam. -Who? Ignore this, madam It is common in our film- WHO? Producer Sripathi And his stooge Mutyam wrote it. -What is his address? -Madam? What is that Sripathis address? DIRECTOR NAVEENS SPICED UP SEX GAMES -She asked you for Sripathis address? -Yes, sir. She was in a rage, better you go there too. Shit! Madam, whom do you want to meet? Please, look here! Madam. -Who wrote this article? -I did. Why are you hitting me? He told me to write it. Who the hell are you? Get hold of her. Hey! -Hey -What, man? How did you com- Are you always this rash and impulsive? Do you know what a rogue he is? If Bose hadn't called me? Come. I'll go with Naveen. Shall I tell you something? The producer who forced my ex to sleep with him... He was this Sripathi! What? So whenever he asked me to direct a film for him, I would tell him to get lost! Now slapped by you and bashed up by me. Long overdue, eh? -Mano, I forgot... -Hmm? Spoke to Surya? I told him I'll meet him tomorrow morning. I don't know what to tell them. I have to finish that film, father. Do you know why? Because even you fell for that trashy gossip! And doubted your own daughters character? That's why... I have to complete that film. My sister is a part of me, father. Only when I was acting in this film, I met the sister in me for the first time. That's why... I must fulfill her dream for her. So... I'll stay in Jo's place till this film is done. If you want anything, call me. Please take care. Alekhya, ready? -Ready -Roll sound Sound rolling. -Roll camera.-Rolling, sir. Scene 75, by 3, take 1. Action. Who? Namaste, sir. Who is this? It's okay. I won't come inside. I know your opinion about my profession and me. Even though I know that's wrong I'm not here to convince you otherwise. And I have no intention of giving you a lecture on dignity and self respect. Worrying 24x7 about what others think of us... is not my idea of 'life'. You've lost heavily in life, sir. The depth of that loss, I can't measure even remotely. I didn't make this film to cash in on your trauma. I firmly believe the world should watch this story. So... Here's the deal, sir. Firstly... After you watch the film, If you don't like it, I won't release it. I'll destroy this film permanently. I'll ensure the world doesn't even know one such film was ever made. Secondly... Alekhya is my life, sir. I love her more than anything else in this world. But I promise you, sir. If you don't like this film... I'll never-- I'll never meet your daughter again. I won't show my face to her or both of you ever again. Our breath has to stop some day. I'll get by with my life thinking it left a bit earlier! But you, But you should never lose your daughter. Not again, sir. Not because of me. That's why I took it as my personal responsibility to invite you. And, sir. Giving birth to daughters... Pampering them in their childhood. Getting sentimental about them. Finding a groom and getting them married... We see it all the time, sir. Let's also try and learn to be proud of them, sir. Hmmm? Think about it. AA AMMAI GURINCHI MEEKU CHEPPALII Must Tell You About That Girl. Yeah, I know. -Good luck and all the best, sir. -Thank you. -God bless you, Alekhya. -Thank you, sir. -Best of luck. -Namaste. Bose, show started? Please go in and sit, sir. -Naveen's parents. -Hey, Bose... -Why don't you come too? -Coming. -Come. -Let's go Agni. -Hi, sir. -Hi. -Bose, how's the movie. -Congratulations! -Hey! How are you? -Wonderful. Thank you. Hello! Come... come, please. I thought your parents won't come. Suddenly they called me and asked if I'll escort them. 'How can you miss my acting?' I asked. When they were still in shock I brought them over here. Thank you. -Congratulations! -Thank you. Not about this film I know it will be good. You know why, right? -See you later then. -Thank you. -Hey! I'll go with him. -Yeah. -Bose, how am I in the film? -True to your name, like an orange! How is my acting? Soooper! You will be the heroine in my debut directorial venture. -Hey hi. -Don't greet random strangers. You're a celebrity! My role in this film must be too small for you. I hope it's not a problem. It's okay, we'll be fine. AA AMMAI GURINCHI MEEKU CHEPPALI I'm afraid all this is but a dream. Too flattering sweet! ...to be substantial. Think if your love be pure -Your purpose marriage? -It is, my lady. 'Dude, come on Golden chance, kiss her'. 'Kiss...kiss!' 'We want a kiss! We want a kiss!' 'NO MEANS NO' Don't you understand Telugu? You embarrassed us with those intimate scenes on stage. Dad, I want to be an actor. Shut up! What's your age? What do you know of life? If you had sat next to me at least once and spoken to me fondly You would've known what I know and what I want. -Did you? -Akhila, don't behave like a lunatic. Do you know what you're saying? I'm not the lunatic, You are! I am an actress and I want to act. Because it is humiliating for you I am leaving. Akhila, listen to me. So welcome to our world. Hey! Are you okay? Yeah, but... I keep thinking of my parents. Don't worry, give them some time. They will come around for sure. -Okay? -Okay Our film is stalled. Our producer Mr Ramaraju and his family were involved in an accident this morning, He passed away. Deepak! What are you doing? -I failed you. -What are you doing? It's okay. We'll get over this, Deepak. Doctor, please. Somehow try to-- Hey Varun That's you, eh? It's a case of clinical depression. It is a bit severe. He is under sedation We must wait for 2 days. -Stay by his side and take care. -Nawazuddin! I did a good job, right? -Now -Huh...huh? The girl who opens the door for her dad is not Alekhya. But your elder daughter Akhila. I found a reel of Akhila's film abandoned 6 years ago. I joined it to Alekhya's shots. Father...? Can I come in, dear? Come in, father. It's my sister. I'll make coffee for you, 1 minute. Okay, dear Father! Sugar only 1 spoon, right? Yes, dear. Please, father. If I destroy my dream, It is as good as killing myself! Please understand. You care about your prestige, father. Not about me. Thank you. Hey! What is it? -You know what? -What? I found a producer. -Really? -Yes. Mr Parameswar owns a novelty shop in Kakinada, selling fancy goods He has got into the cinema line. He is financially not strong now. The budget is a little tight. But he believes in me 100%. Isn't that enough? You've modified Deepak's story as yours. But gave me all the credit. Although my parents threw me out when I wanted to be an actor, I feel they still love me. Because... I wouldn't exist without them. So mom and dad thank you so much for having me. This is for you. Your daughter is, A great actress, sir. Hey Varun! -Liked the movie? -Soooper! Thank you, good job. Thank you. Thank you. Congrats, Naveen. Whenever I feel like seeing my Akhila, She is right in front of me, thanks to you. Thank you. Today I've lost, -And you have won. -Finally?! So...? So...?! Your problem #1 Was to complete the film? You aced it. You still haven't told me your problem #2? My clinic number. Call and fix an appointment. Your eyes are acting up. No way! The moment I used the eye drops you prescribed, My entire vision changed, you know? Ooh! Why didn't you caution me about its side effects? Side effects? What are they? -That means as per your theory-- -I'll kill you. -All those I prescribed it to-- -You're dead meat! Should suffer from the same effect? This is my special side effect.
