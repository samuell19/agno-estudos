(crickets chirping) (ominous orchestral music) (dog barking) (eerie orchestral music) (dog barking) (dog barking) (engine revving) (intense orchestral music) (horn honking) - Yes, sir? - Dr. Mandeville to see Mr. Marr, Mr. Andrew Marr. I'll check with the office. Well, please be quick. The man is dying! (Andrew breathes uneasily) I should have been sent for sooner. (Andrew mumbling) You're not on the medical staff, Mr. Foster. And he hasn't much time. I wouldn't waste it if I were you. (phone ringing) (Andrew mumbling) (engine revving) (gates creak and clank) (chain jangling) All these years... You were the only one who is... The house, I promised you... Over there, the, the papers in the book. (Andrew moans) (suspenseful orchestral music) They'll come back, my children. Promise me you'll keep the house and the money for them. I'll go there, Andrew. I'll keep it for them. (Andrew moaning) Where is the money, Andrew? The money, behind the wall. My whole life, my family. You must help me. Which wall, Andrew? Which wall? (Andrew gasps) Alta, in the name of God, forgive me. Alta... (soft dramatic music) He's dead? Yes, he's dead. You can get rid of him now, can't you? Sweep him away and make room for the next poor bastard. (elevator whirring) (elevator clanks) (doors opening) - Along here, doctor. - Thank you. I should have been notified days ago. As it is, I've been driving half the night. Dr. Mandeville? Yes, I came as quickly as I could. Well, there was nothing anyone could do. No, of course not, doctor, of course not. (train rumbling) (indistinct chattering) (train rumbling) - Mr. Foster, is it? - Yes, that's right. Mr. Prescott said to meet you. He's sorry he couldn't come himself, only he's tied up in town. - Business, you know. - I see. Mr. Prescott said you'll be moving into the village. That's right. Marr's Grove. (children playing) - Old Marr's place? - Yes. No one from the village will go near the place. Why not? - It's bad. - Hmm? Things happen there. What sort of things? Just things. People get hurt. You will find out. Take me to Marr's Grove first. (birds chirping) (car approaching) You wanted to see it. There it is. (sign clacks) (ominous orchestral music) - (planks thumping) - Uh! Help me, will you? Just bring me out. I've hurt my leg. (suspenseful orchestral music) Warned you, didn't I. I told you. How did you do this, Mr. Foster? I was looking at Marr's Grove and part of the wooden bridge collapsed. That place is a menace. Yes, I must get it fixed. - Why should you do that? - Well it belongs to me. Andrew Marr left it to me when he died. You're not going to live there, are you? Well don't tell me you believe all these local tales too, doctor? Well, they seem to have some foundation, don't they? (chuckles) Yes. How did you come to meet Andrew Marr? I was on staff at the asylum. - Medical? - No, no, admin. Welfare, mostly. It'll be some time before the house is fit to live in. Where are you staying in the meantime? Well, I've been in touch with Andrew's solicitor. He's asked me to stay with him, very kindly. Welcome, Mr. Foster. I'm Prescott. I'm sorry we're late. I hurt my leg. So we looked in on the doctor. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Dr. Mandeville? Uh, yes. Oh, yes. Uh, please come in. (dog barking) You can see Marr's Grove from your window. - We're quite close. - Yes. Well, good night. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm sure I will. Thank you. (dog barking) (wind whistling) (eerie orchestral music) Mr. Prescott, there's somebody in Marr's Grove. Come and look. (suspenseful orchestral music) Huh, there was someone. The light was on and there was a woman in the room. But the windows are all boarded up. (wind whistling) Perhaps you just, um, perhaps it was a trick of the moonlight. More likely too many brandies after dinner. I'm not used to such luxuries. (Prescott chuckles) on my pay. - Well, goodnight again. - Goodnight. (planks banging) (crow bar clinks) (lock clicks) (keys jangling) (birds chirping) (footsteps tapping) (door opens) (footsteps tapping) (door opens) (door opens) (suspenseful orchestral music) (door creaks and slams) (intense orchestral music) (suspenseful orchestral music) Who's there? Hello? (glass shattering) (intense orchestral music) (suspenseful orchestral music) Kids. (door creaks and closes) What are you doing here? I did knock, but I couldn't make anybody here. Well, I was just, um... Looking around your new house? Yes, that's right. I'm Edward Foster. Yes, I know. My brother told me about you. I'm Sarah Mandeville. Oh, I see. I'm afraid I can't ask you to sit down, or offer you anything. You're much younger than I expected. Oh? Most of the men in this village have passed it. It'd be nice to have somebody younger. When shall we start? I beg your pardon? Cleaning up. - You hired any help yet? - No. Good. I'll do it. I couldn't ask you to do that. You didn't ask. I volunteered. I'm bored, Edward. Let me help. I'm a very enthusiastic cook, cleaner, housekeeper. You name it, I like it. And I'm completely available. Bank never discloses details of its customer's affairs, Mr. Foster. But he's no longer a customer, he's dead. Well, still be highly irregular. Let me be blunt, I now own Marr's Grove. I shall need a bank account locally. Do you want the business or not? Well, it's just that it is so very irregular. Well, I'm staying with Mr. Prescott. No doubt he can recommend me a bank. Oh, well, Mr. Prescott? Oh, well that makes all the difference. Please, sit down. I shan't need to consult any vigor. I handled this whole affair personally from Mr. Marr. You know, I've often wondered what happened to that money. The sum which I handed to him in cash on that day was 210,000 pounds. (motorcycle buzzing) (dog barking) You'll only be able to live in a few of the rooms. Unless of course you're planning do the place up a bit. Sell it. Oh no. I promised Andrew I'd look after it in case the children came back. Children? - Andrew Marr's children? - Yes. - What's wrong? - You didn't know? They're dead. Oh. When, when did they die? They were murdered. So was his wife. That's what sent Andrew Marr insane. That's why the villagers won't go near the place. They swear it's haunted by the children. He's after the money. He must be. We've got to scare him off. What do you think I've been doing all morning? (liquid pouring) - You've been over there? - You offered to help? - Of course. - Good. My God, if he should get his hands on that money after all our efforts... He's nice, isn't he? Can't you keep your hands off anyone? He'd be quite attractive if he had 200,000 pounds. Quite eligible. You are a bitch, Sarah. Jealous? (gate creaking) (birds chirping) (suspenseful orchestral music) (dagger thuds) (vacuum whirring) (footsteps tapping) - Hello. - Hello again. The place is very filthy. Now are you sure about this? Don't turn me down, Edward. Nobody else in this village will come near this place. But it doesn't worry you? You're here. - Have you got everything? - I believe so. (vacuum whirring) (ominous orchestral music) (picture frame clacks) (suspenseful orchestral music) Who is she? - Alta Lynchman. - Alta Lynchman? "Alta, in the name of God, forgive me." That was the last thing Andrew said before he died. Is that why you ask about her? No, I saw her at the house today. I don't think so. As far as anyone knows, she's dead. Ohno, I, I saw her, looking exactly like that. (chuckles) If she was alive today, she'd be at least, oh, 50. Oh, I see. Hmm. How did she die? We can't say for sure, but I believe what everyone believes, that she was murdered at the same time as Andrew's children and wife. - What a lovely girl. - What exactly happened? Nobody knows. We never found the bodies. - Will you have some coffee? - No, thank you. There's a curious picture of Andrew at the house. Yes, I know. You're very much like him, aren't you? Quickly, come and look! That's where the light was last night. Children's day nursery. I'm going over there. - I wouldn't if I were you. - Why not? Well, I don't know. Perhaps we should call the police. If you go, you might have another accident, especially in the dark. - No, I'll go. - Shall I- - By myself. (footsteps tapping) (rotary clattering) (phone ringing) 237? Hello? Hello, who is calling? (suspenseful orchestral music) (switch clicks) (intense orchestral music) (eerie music) - (switch clicks) - Who's that? Who is it? (cane tapping) Oh. (furniture banging) (cane tapping) Put those bloody lights on! (suspenseful music) (footsteps shuffling) (switch clicks) You're not going to get rid of me. Do you hear me? This is my house! (knocking on wall) (suspenseful music) (tapping on wall) (knocking on wall) (glass shattering) (suspenseful music) (glass clinking) (car approaching) (birds chirping) Be careful. Edward? Good morning! Oh, let me take those. Thank you. You're here early. - There's so much to do. - (engine whirring) I want to move in as soon as I can. (engine revving) What are you doing here? Not that it's any of your business, but I brought Sarah over. She's, uh, going to do the housekeeping for the new owner. You still think that money is here don't you? I know it is. And so do you otherwise you'd have settled up the estate long ago. You have no right to Andrew Marr's money. None whatever, my dear Prescott. Any more than you have. (engine revving) I thought if we did the drawing room next and then a bedroom, I can move in. That shouldn't take more than a few days. Good. I can hardly wait. Neither can I. I thought I might have a small dinner party to celebrate moving in. Can I ask you to organize it for me? Of course you can ask. Oh, please, Sarah, will you organize- - Yes. You really are very disconcerting. Is that all? No, it's not all. Hello? Anyone at home? Come on in! It's a bit of a mess. Isn't it? If swords and things kept dropping on top of me, I'd be frightened to death. Well I am frightened. I don't mind admitting that. Then please, don't sleep here tonight. Yes, why stay here on your own? I suppose I'm just obstinate. Let me give you some more. (fire crackling) This is my house. And I'm not going to let anyone drive me out of it. He's frightened. Keep this up, and we'll get rid of him yet. Yes. You don't agree? Do you remember he told us about the night when his coat was moved, and the photograph frame was taken out of the pocket and thrown across the room? - Yes, that was marvelous. - How did you do it? I didn't. I didn't have anything to do with it. [Edward] It was the last episode at the end of regimen. We must talk about it again. Well, thank you again, Edward. - Thank you for all. - Good night. You've done, good night. Good night. Good night. Thank you, Edward. It was a very pleasant evening. It's all do to Sarah. Uh, thank you. I'll see you tomorrow, Edward. Yes, good. - Good night. - Good night. (locks clicking) (wine pouring) To you, my friend. (intense music) All right, you bastards! Who are you? The doors are locked, you can't get out! (door opens) (children giggling) (children whisper and giggle) (children giggling) (footsteps thudding) (door slams) (eerie music) (rock horse squeaking) (door slams) (door knob clattering) Francis, Jessica? Open this door. (gentle orchestral music) Will you please stop being stupid and open this door! (children giggling) - Come on, hide. - (footsteps thudding) (Edward sighs) I know where the key is so I shall let myself out! But you will be punished! (lock clicks) Francis? Jessica? Come here at once! You've been impossibly rude to your governess all day! I will not tolerate it any longer! (suspenseful orchestral music) (knocks on door) Alta? [Alta] Andrew? Can I come in? No, please don't. They're watching us. Wherever I go, they follow me and watch. Please go away. (soft dramatic music) (eerie music) (door slams) (door opens) (switch clicks) (soft dramatic music) (birds squawk and chirp) When you've settled in, we must discuss the estate. If you're not going to farm it, I could use some old grazing land. Yes, all right. (birds squawking) Edward, will you forgive me if I speak frankly? Yes, of course. It's about Sarah Mandeville. She'll make the place very comfortable for you and, uh, you'll be well looked after, but I think you should advertise for a proper housekeeper. You see, Edward, um, I know you find her attractive. And she is, but I know her reputation. And at the risk of sounding rather Victorian, I want to tell you that she has, well, she's ruined the lives of several men. She wanders in and out of my life like a dream. - I beg your pardon? - Alta. I can't stop thinking about her. The children have noticed. They watch us all the time. Edward? I'm sorry. I was thinking about... I was miles away. You were, weren't you? (footsteps thudding) (dishes clacking) Hello. I looked everywhere for you. I went out for a walk. A sound mind and a healthy body. Yes. Something like that. Well, I think we've done very well. Kitchen, drawing room, bedroom. What should we do today? Suggest something, Edward. For God's sake, Edward. Do I have to ask you? (sighs) That's better, Edward. (Sarah laughing) (Sarah moaning) Wait. (footsteps thudding) (birds chirping) (Sarah sighs) (suspenseful music) (pickax scrapes) (stomps foot) (footsteps thudding) (pickax scrapes) I thought you were gonna sleep all day. And what time is it? It's nearly lunchtime. You hungry? I could eat you. Come on. I'll fix you some lunch. (birds chirping) - Edward? - Mm-hmm? Do you trust Mr. Prescott? Yeah. He seems honest. Do you know much about the law? If it's all the same, why? What's wrong? What is it? Edward, an insane person cannot sign a legal document. Cannot make a will. Mr. Prescott is a solicitor. He knows the law. He knows that will isn't legal. Why did he let you have this house, Edward? I told him about the will. He was stunned. Well that should stir him into action. If he knows where the money is, he's gonna get it as soon as possible. I'll go over a little earlier tomorrow. Prescott, pulling a trick like that. (liquor pouring) You're gonna have to stay a bit closer to our friend Edward over next few days. - That won't be hard. - Mm? Nothing. Have you any idea where it is? - Yes. - You have? The master bedroom, I think. Why do you think that? Well, I was looking up at the ceiling over his shoulder... (clock ticking) You dirty, filthy, little slut. Oh, poor Ian. Don't you sometimes with that I wasn't your sister? (pickax banging) (wall crumbling) (wings flapping) (bats squeaking) Uh! (wings flapping) (bats squeaking) (Edward grunting) (window smashing) (wings flapping) (bats squeaking) (Edward breathes heavily) (children giggling) (footsteps thudding) (suspenseful orchestral music) (eerie orchestral music) What is it? What's wrong? The children again, of course. (clock ticking) What am I gonna do with them? I can't have them making your life a torment too. You know what the trouble is? - Mm. - Don't you? You're the one who spoils them. You're not being honest. It's the same as your wife. All sweetness and light when we're with them, full of delusions and viciousness the next. She's had a difficult time. She's ill, Andrew. Mentally ill. And the children have inherited it. No, they're just, uh, (clears throat) Undisciplined and a bit destructive. And evil. Andrew, be honest with yourself. Be... (door creaking) (children giggling) (suspenseful orchestral music) (intense orchestral music) (Edward gasping) (suspenseful orchestral music) (liquor pouring) (Edwards gasps) You're not going to possess me, Andrew. I'm stronger than you are. (birds chirping) (knocks on window) (wood clattering) - Good morning. - Hello, you're early. An old proverb. Early bird catches the master before he can get out of bed. (Edward chuckles) (door closes) You look tired. I, I slept badly. Why don't you go back to bed and I'll bring you some coffee after? No, you've worked very hard this week. - You deserve a day off. - Nonsense. I mean it. All right, thank you. I'll just make your bed before I go. No, not even that. You're going to take the whole day off. Come on, I'll walk you to the village. (motor buzzing) (ducks quacking) Should we take the canal past to the village? - I don't know. - Come on, I'll show you. (footsteps pattering) (birds chirping) Oh, we can take the shortcut through to the trees. Can't we? I thought you hadn't been here before. I haven't, but, uh, there's a path by that tree, isn't there? Yes. Are you psychic? (suspenseful orchestral music) Are you coming? (gentle orchestral music) You're feeling guilty about leaving them. Aren't you? Yes. Always them. (soft dramatic music) Have you decided? I can't commit my wife, my own children. They've got to be committed sooner or later. We can wait. I can't. I'd rather leave you then spend all my life waiting. (soft dramatic music continues) Don't leave me, Alta. What's wrong? Alta? Edward, you're hurting my shoulder. Yes, thank you, doctor. Goodbye. - Morning, Sarah. - Morning. - Anything wrong? - He made me take the whole day off. And he wouldn't let me go near the bedroom. Then he started behaving very strangely. I think he was trying to frighten me off. Go to find a way of getting him out of the house, and you back in. (knocking on wall) (children and woman giggling) [Woman] He won't find it. (clock ticking) (knocking on wall) [Child] Look, there is the man. Knock, knock, knock. [Children] Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock! I'm stronger than you are. Stronger! (knocking on wall) (clock ticking) (keys jangling) (children laughing) You won't do it! I'm not leaving! (birds chirping) (suspenseful orchestral music) My whole life... My family... (key scrapes) (lock clicks) (intense orchestral music) (pickax scraping) (knocker banging) (birds chirping) (knocker banging) (pickax clatters) (latch clicks) (lock clicks) He's coming. Good morning. What do you want? Today's Sunday, isn't it? Of course it is. We're going for a walk. Edward, would you like to come along? Um, no thanks. You don't look too well. Fresh air would do you a world of good. - No, thanks. - Oh, come on. I said no. Very well. Didn't mean to bother you. I'm sorry. I haven't been sleeping well. A walk would do me good. (bird squawking) (bell tolling) [Sarah] I think it's much too early to be here. [Ian] It's naturally late, that's all. (indistinct chattering) [Edward] Good morning, Mr. Prescott. Come and join us. It's a lovely day. Thank you. Good morning. [Sarah] Oh, the Lewis'! - What about them? - They're coming to lunch and I haven't prepared anything. I'll have to go back. I'll see you later. (bell continues tolling) (birds chirping) (footsteps pattering) (lock clicks) Where's Sarah? She went back. (Echoes) (intense orchestral music) Of course. - [Ian] She'll join us later. - (echoes) I haven't been sleeping well. (Echoes) (eerie orchestral music) Might be able to prescribe something. (Echoes) The house...(indistinct) What makes you so frightened? (Echoes) Have there been anymore incidents? (Echoes) (eerie orchestral music continues) Are you all right? I must get back. (doorknob clattering) (pounds on door) (Sarah sighs) [Jessica] Frances! [Francis] Here I am! [Jessica] Come on, let's pick something fun. (gasps) We, we've only got a few minutes. They've gone down the hill. (Whimpers) What's wrong? They wrote, they wrote horrid, filthy things about us on blackboard this morning. Then she came in. (Alta cries) I can't stand it anymore. What did she say? She said that she knew that I was only after you for your money. She said that if she disfigured me, you wouldn't want me anymore. Now, my darling. She says these things, but she'd never do anything, so don't be frightened. (Alta gasping) Oh, I am frightened. You weren't there. She means it. So do they. It's only a day or two more. Tomorrow, I see the bank. And then I am going to tell her. (children laughing) (Alta gasps) (birds chirping) This time you have overstepped the mark! I'm gonna lock you up where you can't do any more harm! (children screaming) Edward, for God's sake! Get your hands off of them or I'll call the police! [Child] Granny, he just grabbed us for no reason at all! We weren't doing anything! - Are you all right, darlings? - Now come along, come along. I told not to run away from me while we were in the woods. - We didn't! - You've been a naughty... Do you think it's serious? Well it looks like hypertension. I'll give him an injection. It'll help him to relax. I'm stronger than you. There is enough for all of us. More than 200,000. Victoria and the children shall have half, and you and I... Oh, Alta. (door closes) (clock ticking) (suspenseful orchestral music) [Child] Come on! (footsteps pattering) - (door slams) - Let yourself out! I'll tell Mommy! (Edward whimpering) Andrew? Andrew? No. Please, no. Andrew? They've gotten out. They've been chasing me. - (children laughing) - Go on, then. They're just playing. - Have you told her? - I had to get the money first, half for her, half for us. Here, take this. Go upstairs, lock your door, and pack. We leave this afternoon. I'm gonna tell her now. Oh no, please, don't tell her. Let's just leave. No, I must tell her. [Victoria] Is that you, Andrew? I'm just coming. (footsteps tapping) Uh, we're going to have a lovely, lovely lunch. Especially for you. It's a surprise. I want to talk to you, Victoria. The children found it. Such dears. I'm always surprised at how much they understand things. They love you very much, you know. Yes, Victoria, I want to talk to you about them now. Oh, you don't have to say anything about them. You think you want to say something, but it isn't necessary. We know, we all understand, but we're helping, try to make things easier for you. We're going to have a proper, family lunch, just the four of us and (chuckles) you will be surprised. Will you stop talking, Victoria, and sit down? Now don't start getting angry, Andrew. We're all making a very special effort. It's going to be nice. I like things to be nice. What I have to say is serious and it can't wait. Wait? Of course it can wait. Everything can wait. (dishes clinking) You were always very good at waiting. Remember? Half the young men in the county were running after me, and you said- I've got to talk to you about Alta. (Victoria gasps) We're going to start with melon. You like melon. So do the children. I love Alta. You know it but you won't admit it. Then the children thought veal. Done the way you like it. I couldn't decide- Please, listen to me! I won't! I've got to... Can't remember. Um, not veal. No, we, we... Uh. Now let's... (glass shatters) Now look what you've done! You've spoiled it. You always spoil everything. (Sobbing) Try to be calm. Calm? I smash a glass, one of my favorite glasses, and all you do is talk about that slut! Slut! (glass clinking) She's a slut! (dishes cracking) A slut! A, a slut! (glass cracking) (dishes crack and clink) Never! Throw it back at me! (utensils clinking) (Sarah gasping) (chairs banging) (dishes clinking) (Sarah sobbing) (Edward whimpering) All right. You can keep it. All of it! (Edward sobbing) I'm going! (keys jangling) (lock clicks) (latch clicks) (handle tapping) (Edward gasping) (hands tapping) (Edward breathes heavily) (latch clicks) It's mine. It's mine. It's mine. (Edward laughing hysterically) (Edward sighing) (Edward continues laughing) (Edward sighing) (Edward snoring) (keys jangling) (key scraping) (boot unzips) (Edwards snoring) Victoria. It's all right, my darling. It's all going to be just like it was. Victoria, for God's sake! - She tempted you, didn't she? - Mm. Hmm? (Victoria moaning) Victoria, don't be stupid! (Victoria moaning) (loud banging) (Alta screaming) Alta! (children laughing) (Alta screaming) [Child] Come on! - She's in there! - Come! [Alta] Andrew! (Screaming) Dammit, let me go! It's nearly over, darling! The children are taking care of her. - What do you mean? - Andrew! (objects banging) (Alta screaming) Andrew! Help! (Victoria gasping) (Alta screaming) (glass shattering) (Edward breathes heavily) (Victoria choking) Andrew! (intense orchestral music) (Sarah choking) Help me! (suspenseful orchestral music) (latch clicks) (pickax thuds) (wall crumbling) (engine revving) (wall crumbling) (suspenseful music continues) Oh my God. Oh my God. (knocker banging) Edward? (crows cawing) Edward? Sarah? - What do you want? - I want to see Sarah. (clock ticking) Edward, please open this door. (clock ticking) Sarah isn't here! Edward, you open this door or I am going to send for the police! (clock ticking) Where's Sarah? (crows cawing) I don't know. What in God's name have you been doing? What are you so nervous about? Go away. I'm not well. I know that. I've telephoned the asylum. They told me they had no Edward Foster on their staff. (crows cawing) You were a mental patient, weren't you? You were discharged the day after Andrew Marr died. (crows cawing) Nobody here need ever know. (clock ticking) I've come to help you. Help? With the money. You've found it, haven't you? In the bedroom. No, I haven't. (crows cawing) (footsteps thudding) Stop! Please, don't! (footsteps thudding) Sarah. This... Sarah. (suspenseful orchestral music) (door closes) Put that down, Edward. She tried to hurt Alta. She tried to stop us going. You're not Andrew Marr! You're Edward Foster. Don't you understand? Edward Foster. (suspenseful music continues) - The money's for Alta. - You shan't take it. You, you can have the money, Edward. You can have all of it. Edward! (pickax thuds) (intense orchestral music) (Alta screaming) (children laughing) (suspenseful orchestral music) Where is she? Where's Alta? (bat banging) I'm grown up now. Francis, where is Alta? She's gone to bed, Daddy. (eerie orchestral music) (bat bangs) I'm grown up, too. - (train smashes) - Alta? (intense orchestral music) Alta! (Edward sobbing) Daddy. (eerie orchestral music) You don't have to go away now. We can stay together always. (suspenseful orchestral music) (children screaming) Daddy, Daddy no! Please! (sword whacking) (crows cawing) Edward? Edward, are you there? (clock ticking) Mandeville? Edward? (birds chirping) Hello, hello? Get me the police, please. Sergeant Riley? This is Mr. Prescott. Listen, there have be two murders in Marr's Grove. (Prescott sighs) (suspenseful orchestral music) Edward. (door thumping) (Prescott grunting) (lock clicks) (suspenseful music continues) (intense orchestral music) (doorknob clattering) Mr. Prescott. - That's him, that's the man. - It's for Alta. - Get him. - Hold him, Robert. (suspenseful orchestral music) Oh, Lord, Mr. Prescott, look at this. It must be Victoria, Alta, and the children. And there are two cases in here. Hmm. I better take charge of those, Sergeant. I'm still administer of the estate. There's no harm in just having a little look, sir. (keys jangling) (latches clicking) (officers chattering) Thank you for your help, Mr. Prescott. (birds chirping) Alta. Alta. (door closes) Alta. Sarah. (engine starting) Alta. (engine revving) (soft dramatic music) (birds chirping)
