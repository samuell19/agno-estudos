Say, you pull through the drive-through and you order a burger, right? Little girl in the paper hat, first thing she says to you is, "Do you want fries with that?" Now, you didn't pull in wanting fries, but now that she's planted the idea in your head, you think, "Well, God damn! A burger just don't taste right without fries, right?" (CHUCKLES) The next thing you know, you find yourself handing out your hard-earned dollars to buy some fries that the little girl in the paper hat ordered for you. Now, what'd she just do to you? She just upsold your ass. So, you see, the burger is like the AK. But the silencer, that's the fries. All's we got to do, is make them believe that they can't have one without the other.

AGENT BYRD: You might have a license to sell firearms, Rick, but I think we can both agree that you're not legit. Frank, I've never sold an unregistered weapon to anybody. Not knowingly. And I've got papers on every piece to prove it. You got the papers on the silencers? 'Cause that makes it manufacturing. Then you got possession, you got distribution. That's a 10-year ticket, Rick. You want to go away for 10 years? Come on. You sure you don't recognize anyone? RICHARD: Come on, guys, look. I'm just a dad trying to do right by his kids. Two or three years, I make my stake. I open up some video stores, I'm getting the kids out of here, take 'em someplace nice. And besides, I live here. And you don't think one of these scumbags will sell you out in a second? - I don't know any of 'em. - Why are you protecting them? - I'm not... - What about you? RICHARD: Rick, go back in your bedroom. No, guys, leave my fucking kid out of this. It's all right. No, it's not.

Two dead guys. What about him? You know him? - No. - You sure? RICHARD: He said he's sure. I think that's enough for the day. Why don't you two get the fuck out of our house.

AGENT SNYDER: We're not here to see your dad. - Why don't you get in the car? - For what? I got someone I want you to meet. Get in the car. I'm trying to get the fuck home. AGENT SNYDER: Ricky, this is Jackson. Detroit PD, Narcotics Division. Jackson, Ricky. AGENT BYRD: Ricky, you know who the first lady of the United States is, right? You know what she says about drugs? "Just say no." That's right. Problem is we got too many people saying yes. - Especially on the East Side. - You got fries? You ever use crack cocaine, Rick? - No. - You know what it look like? - Ketchup. - There's no ketchup. Who the fuck buys fries and no ketchup? Look. Here's a pie, okay? I don't want no fucking pie. I want ketchup. Hey, man, fuck the pie and the ketchup. Man, just eat the damn fries. Get your arm off the bird. It's a gift for my sister, asshole. Hey, how is your sister, Ricky? When was the last time you saw her? You don't want to get the motherfuckers that sell to your sister? Yo, stop fucking playing with me. You know, fuck this shit. I'm gone. Who the fuck you think you are, you little punk? AGENT SNYDER: Jackson. - Feed you my fucking fist. - Jackson. Let him go. Jackson. Ricky, we just want to show you something, okay? Man, what's up with you people and photographs? I supposed to know who this is? AGENT SNYDER: He was shot twice in the back of the head. RICK: Think that's news on the East Side? We haven't found the killer yet, but we did find the weapon. .40 caliber. This particular weapon was purchased at a gun show earlier this year. By a licensed dealer. Your father is a businessman, who happens to have some clients that are total fucking scumbags. But the good news is the only people who know about this problem are sitting in this vehicle. Which is good for you. For the moment. It's really up to you, though. DETECTIVE JACKSON: You're gonna buy drugs for us. You're gonna do what we call controlled buys. It's gonna help us determine where the drugs are being sold, so we can get warrants. This is fucked up. So, what's my take? $200. - Three. - (DETECTIVE JACKSON SCOFFS) AGENT SNYDER: Fine. But only if you make five buys. RICK: All right. (COCKS GUN) - AGENT SNYDER: Whoa, whoa, whoa! - Shit! Hey! No firearms. - You all got 'em. - Yeah, 'cause I'm the motherfucking PD and they're the motherfucking FBI, - you little motherfucker. - Then why don't the motherfucking PD and the motherfucking FBI walk they asses down there? - We got your back, Rick. - Blow me.

MAN 1: You mean to say the commissioner didn't get in touch with you? MAN 2: No, he didn't get in touch with me, not a word. No investigation, no undercover work! MAN 1: I had no idea, Frank. MAN 2: Well, Captain, I think it's only fair to tell you. I've been to outside agencies. I'm-a go to more if I have to. How I'm supposed to know where any of this stuff been?

REPORTER: (ON TV) Police sources tell me they believe this was a retaliation shooting, part of an ongoing drug dispute. Damion and Frankie Lucas were here alone, watching television. The home is owned by their uncle, Leon Lucas. 28 shots were fired from modified AK-47s, which are flooding the market. One of those bullets hit Damion Lucas in the chest. His brother Frankie called 911. FRANKIE: Please hurry! My brother just got shot! Please come to 3344 Judith Drive. - I don't know what to do! - RAY: That's right over here. REPORTER: We have also learned that Leon Lucas has a criminal record for narcotic violations. RAY: You know the kid? REPORTER: His nephew Damion was rushed to Mount Carmel Mercy Hospital and pronounced dead on arrival. (DISHES CLATTERING) Ha! Jesus, Ricky. Are you trying to get yourself shot? I'm looking for a gun. Grandma keeps hiding mine. No offense, Dad, but you look like shit. I'm old and poor, Rick. What's your excuse? When did you get back from Vegas? It's a long way to go to see somebody get their ass kicked in three rounds, isn't it? Well, I actually didn't catch the fight. You know, I played a little blackjack, met a girl. - A nice Jewish girl. - Jewish? Yeah. Seeing as how you've converted. The star, Ricky. It's Jewish. What the fuck? How stupid are these guys you're hanging around with? How stupid are you? I mean, at least they ain't old and poor. Least they ain't borrowing money from their parents. Shit, their parents probably borrowing money from them. There's a .38 on top of the vent. I want you to go back to school, Ricky. - (GUN COCKS) - Hear me? These guys you're hanging around with, you're gonna get in too deep. And then they ain't gonna let you out. Who, Dad? The Currys or the cops? - GIL: Have you seen the news? - JOHNNY: Gil, it's been on TV - all day, man! Of course I seen it! - Were you there, Johnny? Hell no! You know I wasn't there... You got to clean up your shit. I can't make this investigation go away, you know. Now, you better not have any AKs laying around, either. Come on, Gil. Gil, you know me. I take care of those who take care of me. And... Now, I hear the Feds have an informant on the street. Make sure you can trust everyone around you. (LINE DISCONNECTS) (RECEIVER SLAMS) You know how much fucking heat this gonna bring? This just ain't no pile of shit you can kick in the woods. This is a fucking child. You know what that mean? It means somebody black ass going down for this whether they did it or not. They just want a nigga. Don't matter if it's the right nigga. They just want a nigga. And guess what nigga it ain't gonna be. It ain't gonna be me or any of my goddamn family! Leon wasn't even in the motherfucking house! (SCOFFS) God damn it! Shit! Go. Go, niggas. Tear your ass! And don't y'all be talking to anybody! You talk, I'll know. (HORN HONKS) What up, money? Forget about something? I ain't forget nothing. Hey, Ricky. Something wrong? Are you fucking kidding me? We need to talk about that little boy, Ricky. What, are you trying to get me fucking killed? What's the matter with you people? I'm done! AGENT BYRD: Come on, relax. Fuck it. Let's go. Here. - What's this? - I made you pancakes. I don't eat pancakes, Ray. I never ate pancakes. By the way, you called me Audrey last night. You said, "Good night, Audrey." I'm not even gonna ask. I don't know an Audrey. Ricky, your grandpa made you pancakes. I don't like pancakes. They give me the runs. (RAY SIGHS) Hey, Dad. Grandpa made some pancakes. - Thought maybe you'd want some. - Yeah? Those all AKs? Mostly. Got to get rid of 'em. Hey, Dad, I'm gonna do what you said. I'm gonna go back to school. Yeah? Okay. Oh, listen, by the way, I made a trade the other day for a Glock. Guy threw in a gold dot. Check him out. He's pretty cool. Name's Ed. Ed? (CAR ENGINE STARTS) (CAR DEPARTS) (KNOCKING AT DOOR) Yo, it's open. - What up, Nugg? - What's up, Ricky? How you doing? You guys really like a lot of movies, huh? Yeah. We're gonna open up a movie store. Good. - You want a soda? - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll take one. - This your fish? - My dad's.

AGENT SNYDER: They say he's gonna make it. - Who fucking did this? - We think one of Curry's crew. I'm gonna kill him. I'm gonna track him down and put a bullet through his scumbag fucking skull. You got to be careful what you say in front of us, Rick. Fuck you, Frank. You don't think I got a bullet for you, huh? - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - Hey, hey, wait, man. You, too, you fucking bitch. And you. AGENT SNYDER: Rick, we're not your enemy. You're responsible for this. For the 15-year-old boy in there. AGENT SNYDER: We've got enough to bring the Currys in now, Rick. - Dad? Where's Rick? - RICHARD: Fuck you. - Dawn, it's okay now. He's all right. - Where is he? I want to see my brother. I want to see Rick. - Dawn, hang on. - I'm going. - God damn it. - Get...

You got to take your jacket off to see. (EXHALES DEEPLY) (MONITOR BEEPING STEADILY) DAWN: What you into, Ricky? They got you listed under "John Doe." Who wants you dead so bad? Least you haven't lost your looks. 'Cause you never had 'em. It was good, wasn't it? When we were kids? For a little while? You still are a kid, Rick. Hey, Ricky. How you feeling? Brought you a present. You might not like the music, though. Who did this to you, Ricky? Was it Steve? Nugg? Was it Boo? Boo would've never done this. Okay. It doesn't really matter who pulled the trigger, because we both know who put the gun in their hands. Johnny knows we have an informant. But it's all worked out for the best, Ricky. We raided one of the houses you were buying from. His crew flipped on him and sold him out. (LOUD THUD) AGENT 1: FBI! FBI! - AGENT 2: Move, move, move! - CATHY: Who is that? Bedroom, bedroom, bedroom, bedroom! - Johnny! - Go, go, go, go! Back up, back up!

I'm going, man. - Shut up! - Are you serious? - Up on your feet! - Come on! - Let him go! - Let's go. - Take your hands off my little brother! He got nothing to do with nothing! Take your hands off him! Yeah, your brother can't help your ass now, huh? AGENT SNYDER: What happened to you could just complicate things. It's better if this never happened. You understand what I'm saying? Just like it's better if we forget about that little hobby of your dad's down in the basement. Here we go, champ. Got to be exciting knowing you're gonna be sleeping in your own bed. - Yeah. - Is Dawn here? No. Apparently, Ty flew the coop. Good riddance, I say. But you know women. Anyway, we don't, we don't need her negativity around here right now. (CHUCKLES) Grandma. You just ever think about moving? It's been so long since anything good has happened. Look, Rick, things are gonna be looking up, you know? First off, we're gonna get you healthy. Look at that. Nice stuff. Come on up. You got it? One step at a time. Here we go, here we go. All right, now. (CHUCKLES) You're not even gonna recognize what's behind this door. I got this place so fucking spick-and-span. - (KEYS JANGLING) - Hang on. Here we go. Home sweet home. Look at that. (WINCING) RICHARD: Hey, champ, you need a hand there? How am I supposed to go to school like this? Ah, well, the thing is... And I've been meaning to tell you... They're not gonna let you go to school. Because you got shot. They think you're a risk to the other kids. Listen, there's spares under the sink, but what do you say we rinse that one out? They're, like, - three bucks a bag. - I'm not rinsing this fucking out. If you want to save money, you rinse it out. Okay, okay. Just asking. You know, maybe we'll buy in bulk next time. Bound to be cheaper. Here, give me that. I'll take it for a wash. All right? Whatever you need, champ. Whatever you need. Hey, Ricky. You know, there's a gun show in a few weeks. Maybe you and I take a road trip, - if you're feeling up for it. - Sounds great. NEWSCASTER: (ON TV) The driver was shot in the arm during the holdup and taken to the hospital. (KNOCKING AT DOOR) Police say the gunfire was staged. If found guilty... ...years in the penitentiary. (KNOCKING CONTINUES) You gonna get yourself shot, knocking on a stranger's door like that, kid. You're Ricky Wershe, right? - Yeah. - You've made a baby with my sister. - Who? - Brenda Moore. You need to call her and be a man about it. Look, I only been with Brenda, like, a couple times. Only take one time to make a baby. Besides, Keisha damn near as white as you is. Who the fuck Keisha? - My niece, your daughter. - RICHARD: Ricky! Shut the fucking door, will you? Letting all the heat out. - Who the hell are you? - You his daddy? - That's right. - Well, now you a granddaddy. Be a man, call my sister. If you don't, I'll be back. And you don't want me coming back. What's he talking about, Rick? I don't know. I chilled with his sister. And you didn't wear nothing? Ah, fuck, Rick. Brenda, your baby daddy here. What's Grandpa doing sitting out there? He drove me. - Ricky Wershe. - Hey, Brenda Moore. Oh, Christ. What? - What's up, Grandpa? - "What's up, Grandpa?" RICK: She's so tiny. She supposed to be that tiny? She only a month and a half. - She's pretty, just like you. - (CHUCKLES) Be bad news if she looked like me. I didn't mean that how it sound. She yours, Ricky. I'm not playing you. I mean, I'm happy she yours. Just make sure you support her head, okay? (BABY GURGLING) (DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES) BRENDA: Acting different around Daddy. This is your daddy. Ain't no way that's my son's baby. She's way too beautiful. Here, son, let me hold her. Let me show you how it's done. Come here, you. Come here. There you are. Yeah. I used to do this little dance with your daddy and his sister, yeah. (BABY GURGLING) (SOFTLY) Yes, ma'am. It's all brand-new, isn't it? You like to dance? Yes, ma'am. RICHARD: Here, straight talk? Your mother and I, we... We didn't plan on having Dawn. I mean, to be honest, we didn't plan on having you, either. But in the end, things worked out. Dad, your daughter is a junkie, and I'm shitting into a bag. Well, what can I say, you know? Glass-half-full kind of guy. You're gonna be a great dad. I know you are. You know, I was thinking, as soon as we get this video store up and running, first thing I want to buy is a new set of wheels. I know things haven't proceeded as anticipated, but a good idea, Rick, is like a fine wine. It gets better with time. Things aren't gonna get better, Dad. You happy with this? You happy with who you are? Don't be thinking what the right answer is. There's only one right answer. You know how we can change this. No. No drugs, God damn it. No drugs. They're poison, Ricky. They kill people. No fucking way. What the fuck do you think you're selling? Water pistols? Ricky, guns are a constitutional right. There's nothing in the Constitution about drugs. The fuck are you talking about? I'm talking about the goddamn Constitution, what this fucking country was founded on, Ricky. - (HORN BLARING) - Dad! Fuck! (SCREAMING) - RICHARD: Uh... You okay? - Yeah. - (PANTING) - (RICK COUGHING) RICHARD: Oh, shit. Look at this shit. Look how we're living. We got to do something, Dad. We got to make some money. No. No drugs, Ricky. - You know I can't do that. - Fuck, Dad. You been selling to the drug dealers every damn day. The only difference is you been making pennies on the dollar. You know, about time we go grab the dollar, don't you think? Hey, come on, Dad. I can do this. We can do this. I mean, I know the players. And I know their game. Ah, Ricky, I already lost Dawn. I can't lose you, too. Dad, we didn't lose Dawn. There's just no way she's coming home the way things are. There's just nothing to come home to. Like, ain't nobody gonna help us. We got to do this before it's too late. I've got a daughter, too, now. RICK: What up, Art? Hey, kid. What the fuck? You told me to look you up sometime. Come in. - What's up, bro? - MAN: Give me an eight, man. Two. (LIGHTER CLICKS) (MAN COUGHING) (DAWN GRUNTS WEAKLY) (COUGHS) RICK: Hey, Dawn. It's me. Ricky. - Ricky? - Yeah. I brought Dad, too. - (DAWN GROANS) - We're gonna take you home. DAWN: Why he here? I fucking... Fucking hate him, Ricky. You know how much I hate him. We're gonna take you home. DAWN: Nah, I don't want to go home. This my home. RICKY: No, Dawn. You need to come with us, okay? You need to come with us now. I got all my stuff here. I can't leave my stuff. It's all shit, Dawn. We'll get you new stuff. You'll get me new stuff? Whatever you want. Promise? I promise. - DAWN: No. No, no, no, no, no, no. - Come on. No, no, no, no, no, no! No, no! Don't touch me! Don't touch me! Get your fucking hands off me, Dad! Get your hands off me! No! (GRUNTING, PANTING) (SCREAMS) Get the fuck off of me! Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

You mean how he doing with you here with his wife in the middle of the night? No, I mean how is he doing? (CATHY CHUCKLES) Johnny in prison for 20 years, that's how he doing. And I'm here. All alone. Why you didn't call me, Ricky? I thought we were friends. I've been busy. Mmm. That's what I hear. White Boy Rick been getting some of Art Derrick Miami sun. (CHUCKLES) You know the reason Johnny in jail and you and me free, Ricky? 'Cause we're smarter. I made Johnny what he was. But he trusts too many people. If he had just stuck to the people I introduced him to, I wouldn't be alone. You wouldn't be here. Like what you see, Ricky? Mmm. Then why you standing over there? What are you doing out here? Keeping watch. Making sure your sister gets home. - (DAWN LAUGHS) - Dad, I'm pretty sure Dawn can cross the street by herself. Yeah, you'd be surprised how easy it is to take a wrong turn, no matter how short the journey. Is you all right? Yeah, I'm better than all right. Seeing you and Dawn tonight, Ma and Pa, hell, I'm damn near perfect. It's just that, uh... Just what? Well, it's fragile. This thing. Family. And I don't want it to come apart, you know? I don't want to break it, again. Well, why don't you go in, and I'll wait for her. Eh, she's my watch to keep. Same as you. (CHUCKLES) I can watch my own ass, Dad. RICHARD: Mmm-hmm. Let's not break this, Ricky. Let's not get greedy. We don't need much more than we already have right now. Yeah. All right, Pops. (SNIFFS) Goddamn. Your ass smells like a whorehouse - on New Year's morning. - For real? Yeah, for real. - (CHUCKLING) - Good night, Dad. - Good night, son. - (DOOR CLOSES) (SIGHING) (ELECTRIC RAZOR BUZZING) (DAWN SNICKERS) The fuck are you doing? - I'm shaving. - Since when do you shave? - Since now. - You ain't got no hair! - Oh, yeah? - No, not the face!

Let go! - Come on. Fuck! - Ricky! Ricky! The fuck you think, Rick, huh? You think you wasn't gonna get caught? I don't know what the fuck you talking about! You don't know what the fuck I'm talking about? Fucker, look at me. Eight kilos. - Keep your fucking hands off of him! - Eight kilos. - Rick! - RICK: You think I'm fucking stupid? No, boy, I think you're fucked, that's what I think! Get off of him! (INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO CHATTER) - Rick! - DETECTIVE JACKSON: Ain't no burgers and fries back there, huh, bitch? The fuck is going on? (PANTING) BUFALINO JR.: This is what we're up against, gentlemen. Okay, I mean, they're making him out like he's Capone. That's the sentiment in the city. The mayor himself has warned me to stay clear of this. Ricky's a leper. Look, Bill, it's not like he killed anyone. 650 grams, Rick. That's the law. You know how much was in that box? Eight kilos. That's 8,000 grams. It would be better for Ricky - if he had killed someone. - Where are the Feds and the cops on this, right? They're the ones that got him dealing in the first place. - Where the fuck are they? - Ask yourself this. Would you believe a 15-year-old kid was working for the federal government? But he was. RICHARD: Listen, Ricky, this... This might be our only chance of cutting a deal. So let me do the talking. Okay. AGENT SNYDER: It's not a conspiracy, Rick. We just can't say anything publicly. Yeah, but I can. I go to the press, tell them the Feds turned my son into a drug dealer, that's headlines from now till Sunday. That's not a smart move. Ricky's in a tough spot. I appreciate that. But we're not here to negotiate. We don't have a lot of power here. This is not a federal case. And the Bureau rejects any narrative that suggests we encouraged Ricky to sell drugs. He did that on his own, and he got caught. And now he's facing a life sentence. We want to offer Ricky an opportunity, maybe a way out. RICHARD: What's he got to do? We'd like to get an agent on the inside. If you can do that, we can get some convictions... Maybe we can return the favor. Those people ain't gonna talk to me. AGENT BYRD: There is someone you could talk to. Her father's close to Gil Hill, not to mention the mayor. Cathy? Cathy's in a bad way. - She don't got nobody. - Look, Rick, just talk to her. Let her know that your Miami connect is coming into town, needs protection for a large shipment. You get her to meet him, get the introduction to the father, and we'll take it from there. You guys are going after Young, aren't you? You're going after the mayor. We have no intention of charging Cathy. - She's not our target. - Just like Boo wasn't? Boo ain't do shit, and y'all still got - his ass locked up. - (RICHARD SHUSHING) RICHARD: Ricky, give this a chance, all right? Listen up. Now, I understand you got feelings for this girl. But this is about getting guys like Jackson, all right? He's half the reason we're here in the first place. I think it's worth a shot, Rick. What do you think, champ? I'll do whatever you say, Dad. Okay. We're gonna need something in writing, all right? Some kind of contract. I'm sorry, we can't do that, Rick. I mean, if we have anything on paper, it's gonna look like Ricky's just saying whatever he needs to, to stay out of jail. (SCOFFS) So what the fuck are you saying? I'm saying you have to trust us. (KNOCKING AT DOOR) - (CLEARS THROAT SOFTLY) - (KNOCKING) (SIGHS HEAVILY) What you doing here, Rick? You know I can't be seen with you. - I just need a minute, Cath. - I can't, Rick. There's a big shipment, and I need help, Cath. NEWSCASTER: (ON TV) Major news tonight as the FBI - makes a public corruption case... - You bastards. - ...in the city of Detroit. - Serves 'em right. Eleven police officers, including Jimmy Harris, were brought into the federal courthouse in handcuffs. Six civilians were also arrested, including the mayor's brother-in-law, Willie Volsan. Several law enforcement sources tell us that it was Rick Wershe Jr., aka White Boy Rick, who vouched for an undercover agent posing as a drug dealer who wanted to hire cops to protect his shipments. Sources also tell us Wershe provided information about homicide inspector Gil Hill and bribes paid to cover up an unrelated shooting. - RAY: What is this? - Nah, it's okay, Pop. Me and Ricky, we got it all worked out. The Feds got it fixed up with the judge. We're all good. We're all good. Wershe, who has clearly made powerful enemies, now faces a life sentence if convicted of the cocaine charges. (QUIET CHATTER) JUDGE: The court will come to order. RICHARD: (WHISPERING) That's what that is right there. Has the jury reached a verdict? Yes, we have, Your Honor. JUDGE: Please hand it to my bailiff. RICHARD: ...lets the judge know that we got a deal for helping out. JUDGE: Will the defendant please rise? The People of the State of Michigan find the defendant, Richard Wershe Jr., guilty of possession with the intent to distribute greater than 650 grams of a controlled substance, which, in the state of Michigan, carries a mandatory sentence of life - without the possibility of parole. - (HANDCUFFS CLICKING) - Rick! - RAY: What is wrong with you people? - This boy is 17 years old! - JUDGE: Juror number one, - how do you find? - Guilty. - DAWN: Ricky! - JUDGE: Juror number two... We're getting to the bottom of this. We're getting to the bottom of this. - JUDGE: Order in the court! - Ricky? Ricky! Ricky! - Rick, baby! - Stay strong! You know what you just did? You took a life. GUARD: Okay, now, give me three good squats. Two. All the way down. Deeper. Hold it, hold it. Keep your cup and your spoon with you at all times. Come on, this way. (ELECTRONIC CHIME) You'll be allowed out in the yard by yourself one hour each day. The remaining 23 hours, you're gonna be secured in your cell. That's for your own protection. There'll be no communicating while you're confined in your cell. If you feel the need to communicate, fill out an inmate request form, drop it in the box. You have any questions? (DOOR CREAKS) (DOOR LOCKS) Hey. Hey. I need to talk to you, Alex. - Hey, Rick. - Yeah? Listen, I got to be someplace, but come by the office - next week, we'll talk. - No, no, I came by the office - three times this week. - Yeah. I know. Well, what the fuck happened, Alex? What do you want me to say? I mean, is anything I say gonna - make you feel any better? - No, Ricky did his bit. - It's time for you to do yours. - Okay. We're in a public place, so I'm gonna need to ask you to keep your voice down. (SOFTLY) Okay, what the fuck happened? Okay, let's be clear. You were promised nothing. You were told that the Bureau would make best efforts with the court to mitigate Ricky's sentence. We did that, the judge was not responsive. "The judge was not responsive"? What the fuck is that? That's what you're calling your best fucking effort? That's your answer? - No, you told me to trust you. - I get that. You told me to trust you. You didn't do shit. - I have to go. Okay. - You sold us out. - I'm leaving now. - You sold us fucking out! I really prefer to drink alone, Rick. It's okay, Frank. We're just a couple of guys on a day off, right? It's not my day off. Why's this happen to my son? Just tell me the truth. - Why him? - Well, you deal in narcotics, - you get busted. - It's not true, Frank. - God damn it, we had a deal. - You know... I can't really square that circle for you, Rick. Your boy was out. And he decided to get back in. And you were not exactly an innocent bystander. (RICHARD EXHALES DEEPLY) (SIGHS) You know, it's not about Ricky. It's not about his little friends. It's not about kids selling dime bags on the corner. We throw the little ones back, but when the big fish gets away, they got to take what's left in the net. So 'cause you don't get the fucking mayor, my kid goes down. He's young. He'll get out. - (ELECTRONIC CHIME) - Come on, high five. (DOOR OPENS, CLOSES) (KEISHA FUSSES) DAWN: Look, sweetie. Look. It's your daddy. Remember? From the picture? The one we kiss each night with Mommy? KEISHA: Hi, Daddy. DAWN: Grandma misses you. Hey, she'd have came, but, uh... Grandpa Ray's still not better. We don't know if he's gonna get better, so... How you doing, Dawn? I hate that you're in here, Ricky. I hate it. Can I talk to her? Hey, want to say, "Hello"? - Hello. - (CHUCKLES) Aw! She's tired. Well, at least you haven't lost your looks. (BOTH CHUCKLE) 'Cause you never had 'em. (CHUCKLES) - Dawn? - Yeah? That picture. Make sure you keep showing her. (SOFTLY) Yeah. Bye. - (KEISHA COUGHS) - Bye-bye. (CHUCKLES) - DAWN: Oh! - (DAWN AND KEISHA LAUGH) Let Grandpa have a go. (DAWN SNIFFLES) Hey, champ. Good to see you. I got some good news. Looks like they might overturn that 650 Lifer Law. I talked to Byrd, and he said that he and Snyder were willing to talk to the board if it comes to pass. And if that happens, you could be up for parole in, like, you know, six years. That is good news. They're not gonna get away with this, Ricky. You know, poked the lion one too many goddamn times. - All right, Dad. - It's like we always talked about, son. You got to lose a few battles to win the war. We didn't talk about it. You did. And the war is over. No, it's not, son. Don't say that. - It's not over, you hear me? - Look where I'm at. It's like I'm dead in here. And that's how they want it. (RICHARD CRYING SOFTLY) Eight pounds, 14 ounces. That's what you weighed when you were born. Ricky, I remember the first time I looked in your eyes, I knew you were gonna be bigger than me. I knew your life was gonna be bigger than mine. Not just in size, but in life, in heart, in spirit. My life was hard, you know? Not yours. Yours was gonna be easy. Gonna be so goddamn easy. And I fucked up. And I'm sorry. (SOFTLY) I'm so... (CRYING QUIETLY) You're my best friend, Rick. No, you're my only friend. You just remember you got me and you got Dawn, you got your daughter, all right? And we're not going anywhere. We're always gonna be right here. All right? Hey, it don't end like this. All right? Don't you give up on me. Ricky, hey, it don't end like this. We're lions. Hear me? We're lions. (SIGHING) (CAR DOOR CLOSES) RICK WERSHE JR.: I don't think there's a person that works here that thinks I belong in prison. You don't know, having that life sentence off of you, the stress that it takes off of you and the foot that's been on my chest for all these years. This is my thirtieth birthday in prison, and, and it'll be the best one, so... Oh, man, I feel overwhelmed with joy, man. I mean, it's like, I swear to God, man, I feel, like, 10 years younger. It's weird, like, so much weight's been lifted off of me. "It's over. You're done. Michigan paroled you." I cried, man. I cried. (LAUGHS, SNIFFLES) And I want to go tell my grandma and grandpa that I made it out of prison, you know? I want to go visit them at their grave site. I got everything I need in life.
