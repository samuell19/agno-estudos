You're Red Phoenix, good bye I had a misunderstanding with Liang Wen You all regard me as an enemy I don't think so You think I'm the red dressed bandit? I don't think so Or suspect he was hidden in my home I don't think so Hey, Red Phoenix Why are you worried? I don't think so You're not going to use that to fight us I don't think so You're going to use that to light red dress bandit? Well... I don't think so My target is the red dress man Good thing, how did you invent it? I listened to Liang Wen's uncle, he said... His paw has great strength He made his paw a sword into a sword? He said, you should concentrate When you concentrate You can hold your breath The seven holes close And your body absorbs the soft wind Red dress man can hold his breath And push his strength to his paw A paw can be as sharp as a sword it can pierce through a heavy board So we must use distance attack strategy Red dress bandit Who are you? You will not die if I don't tell you You'll be double suprised if I do So I'd better not Good! I'll find out my self So we'll have to use distance attack strategy You really don't care do you? So you've already prepared Tsai Wen Brother He went to receive the buddha Who was with him? More than a hundred people Who in our school went with him He went alone Who wanted him to go? The lord Oh No! Young Lord! You are worried about the red dress man Fong Kuan, Ku Chuan were killed Whenever our people are alone Danger will sure come to him Yes sir Uncle, I'll go too We are back We are home Where are they? They've all gone home What are you talking about? The people who retrieved the buddha We're waiting for Tsai Wen He has not come back yet? You idiot You sent me to get information And come back to report to you Teacher, have they come home No, not yet I asked Hsiao Hu Tze He said Tsai Wen was with him first Then someone came and took him away Who would that be? He didn't know either Tsai Wen! Tsai Wen! He's not back, any news? Yes Tell me quick Yu Fong said she wanted to talk to you Go away! Tell her I'm busy You can cry at any time! Is that Mr. Yao I predicted Tsai Wen's fortune What about it? Full of birds and swords it means bad luck Tsai Wen is back Tsai Wen It's Tsai Wen Tsai Wen Lord, uncle sent you a letter Dear Shen Pei: I mourn over Tsai Wen's death I come with relatives To express our condolence Your uncle What did he write? Lord was upset to see that letter Uncle Uncle Liang Wen Uncle Uncle, tell me who did this to you My son, don't fight him Save yourself Uncle! Liang Wen Don't do that, Don't! You don't want me to nail the coffin Step away please Don't do that, don't! Shiang Kei You're his long term servant You don't want him to stay in there? But he has to because he is dead Let Shiang Kei nail it Did red phoenix leak the secret... Of the new weapon to the red dress man? The killer is her uncle You can't be so sure Let's revise and keep it secret How? Put poison in the bird's mouth it goes through steel board, into body He is sure to die So powerful? What are you standing there for? Uncle is here I had a dream last night I saw you die but resurrect Are you going to come alive again? Should I believe the truth or the dream? Uncle, Lord Aunt, Grand Uncle Who is he? Liang Wen It's Shiang Kei Shiang Kei, don't cry Man is dead to his old home town Beware of the walking ghost Brother Ma, when did you come? My room is always a mess Don‘t bother, I'll take care of it myself Ming huang, what's wrong? What's the matter with you? You come here again! Brother, I... Don't cry, you can cry well after I leave Who will you cry to after your brother You came to look for me? Of course, I've got a target You think you can kill me? You're doomed to die Then you can take off your mask I will take it off After I've killed ten people You are the sixth After the next four I will of course take it off You can't even kill me Already prepared! Who told you this? I know everything you did You open yourself? That was a trap Lord Ma, what's the matter Quick, tell Liang Wen Red dress uses traps to attack He opens himself to you When you go to attack You'll be hit by his paw Remember this is his stragey 0h I'll remember You should use "fake attack' “Fake Attack"... Lord Ma! Lord Ma! You say again! I only heard tail attack Except this, he also said a lot I forgot it all Think hard He said... he said... Tell Liang Wen Tell Liang Wen what? It looks... It looks what? You should remember... Remember what? What... what... nothing! What you remember is iust nonsense Why should it be, you to listen to him Forget it, let's start the meeting now Brothers, after our close iudgement We have decided Lin Ming Huang must be the red dress man We'll kill him Kill him! We'll go together Let's go Where is my brother? Let me say it ls Lin Ming Huang home? Yes, he is Let's get him Wait a minute Your brother went to Lin Ming Huang's house Did you see him? I did Listen, your brother was killed by him Oh? Impossible We iust went out together He iust sent me home How is it possible for him to have killed my brother? Well... He wouldn‘t die if nobody killed him But he sure is dead “Tail Kung Fu“ What is that? Ma Chuan told us those two words it must be valuable Ah Liang must have misunderstood him We are getting confused Ma Chuan's killer isn't Ming Huang Then who is that red dress man? How could the red dress man know About the poison on the bird's mouth? I'll have no reason to suspect Red Phoenix Red phoenix didn't know about this Is it one of our close friends? Friend? I suggest no one can listen to our talk Blue dress Ah Liang Yes lord You really fell asleep It was real at first Then it became a fake one So you pretended to sleep I dreamed of fighting with someone Very exhausted, actually didn't sleep Then finally, he slapped me You saved me, thank you Stop! Is this dress yours? Yes When was it made? Yes Why didn't you answer me? Yes I haven't seen you wearing it Yes Don't say 'yes' but answer me Yes I told you not to say yes Yes You can only say 'yes'? Yes Let me say something bad Don't say anything bad I know what you want to say Anyway, it is better to say happy things His face is very soft Alive! He can move You escaped last time Why should you come to us this time? Last Time? No one but you escaped last time I was coming up when you killed my uncle Liang Wen, step away Don't attack him Hurry, save him Tie him up You're right, we'll meet again Don't let him getaway He moves too fast Uncle, you're really a Kung Fu expert! Forgive us for the misunderstanding you I went to Canton to study it that year Couldn't use my chinese name really Many laps helped the warlords They instructed Japanese fighting skills The Japs try to stop us fighting They're determined to destroy us The red dress man is one of them Right! Those who were killed by him Were all patriotic youth He must take all the patriotic people As a big target There‘s one thing you may not believe Why did I become a student of your uncle? It was that you wanted to learn Kung Fu? No, it's that I wanted to learn more about him What about him? His Kung Fu... it's actually Japanese style! I know you won't believe it He wouldn't work with the warlords He wouldn't work with the iapanese either Why should the red dress man kill him? I'll tell you another thing Your uncle may still be alive The coffin isn't nailed properly. He's still alive 1st uncle touched it and felt it So he mentioned the walking ghost That's why Shiang Kei wanted to nail the coffin Lord Liang Wen is our big enemy Why didn't you kill him? Damn! Yes sir Why do you pretend to die? This is your biggest mistake, Pig Because my uncle was waiting to see me I couldn't recognise them all If they asked me questions They might discover my secret Can you solve the problem if you die? I had to cover myself Someone already suspected me Shut up! You're a dummy Where have you been this morning? Not your business. I asked you where have you been You're stupid! I know you're Mr Shan Tien Tell the truth Killing Lord Shen Pei was a fake The red dress man is also a fake obiect Who disguised as red dress man Speak up! You? Thats why you want to run when you see me You put dynamite in the coffin You wanted to kill all of us! My goodness, Uncle saved you Why do you stare at me? My uncle isn't red dress man You think it's me? You're too stupid to investigate But you sure know how to put me in disgrace Uncle, I'm so sorry I didn't know you were here Unreasonable! Yu Fong! Here we are at Chien Lung valley Why should uncle send us here? You look worried You even suspect him? If not even uncle can be trusted Who else can I trust? How about me, can I be trusted? You know he is not reliable Otherwise he wouldn't make trouble Those who you trusted may not be reliable He, he is right You'll be careful if you don't trust anyone Then he can't make trouble Uncle King, why should you wear a mask? You don‘t look good behind the mask Who is your uncle? Then your mother's brother When you're about to die I'll let you see my face Is that really you, uncle? You... why do you have to kill people? Why do you go against the government? Why do you have to serve the laps? Whyl? Yu Fong Uncle Tell me why! Attack him! Don't worry! Uncle Uncle Yu Fong! He doesn‘t recognise you, why do you try? Attack! You'll die if you don't Yu Fong! Uncle You're from King's family But you don't fight like one Now let me show you the King's Kung Fu You see, this is it I learned this from King's grandpa Liang Wen! Liang Wen! I'm coming Uncle He‘s not your Uncle King Shen Pei You're the lake one! Let him go When I concentrate, I have strength When I'm distracted, I lose strength When he first came back He knew more old stories than me Who would suspect he was the fake one? I discovered when I first saw him How did you discover? Grandpa slapped him once when he was young He said it was because grandpa was drunk But grandpa never drank Why didn't you tell me then? He kept Ku Chuan on the hill, so he died He sent Tsai Wen somewhere and he died He designed everything He made us suspect my uncle And made the two families fight Now the important thing is I analyze the red dress man's fighting skill Then try to destroy him He always uses unreal attacks To solicit you to attack But when you attack with full strength He uses your strength against you When the two strengths meet together it will surely kill you If he uses unreal attacks, we'll do the same If we don't fight with full strength We'll be able to defeat him This is the fake attack Ma Chuan mentioned When he fails the attack it's his weakest time We should quickly take this advantage Wait, see if anyone among us will leak the secret Hey, don't be serious with your practicing Red dress man's unreal attack Liang Wen, fake attack He attacks now! Step away! You, you‘re the real red dress man! Red Phoenix, I'll kill you Come on! Get the red dress man! Liang Wen was killed! Come here! What is it Mr. Yao Look Where's Liang Wen What's all this about? Practice should be as real as possible Come out red dress monster! I was proud of you before But we shall fight each other now So we need a mask When we get together He's a talent to tell false truth How do you know everything about our family? The Japs showed me your uncle's diary Why did they choose you? Because I look like your uncle Where is my uncle? Killed by the Japs I'll kill you, running dog of the Japs You got a good face as my uncle But you lack in righteousness You deserved to die Another red dress man I knew there must be some others Because he fights in different than him How come it's Mr. Yao You know nothing about Kung Fu, right? You didn't imagine this? I wanted to let you know who I am Before you die I also wanted you to know how you die Before you die You forgot that... I know all your plans You only know a small part Let's see Fake attack! You used fake attack? You think you know our plan You only know a small part How did you find my vacuum place? We made you surprised from sparks This is your time of vacuum Then we step up our attack This is our fake attack What's the name of that bird? Golden Phoenix Isn't that your nickname I picked for you? Thank you, if you don't call me that again I wouldn‘t have given that name to the weapon I thought of this I should have known there were sparks If only I had known the name
