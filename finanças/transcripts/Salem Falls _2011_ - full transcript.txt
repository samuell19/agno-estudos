GILLIAN (VOICEOVER): I call upon the mother goddess and the father god. I call upon the force's of the earth. They are fire and water. I call upon the sun, moon, and stars to bring me my mother. Send me a sign. Send me a sign. -Show me a sign. -Dad. -Addie, my lovely. It's a quiet night, Addie. A good time to step out for a little nip. Just be a quick trip. -I'd see you've already had more than a nip. I thought I found all your hiding places. -I don't know what you mean. I haven't had a nip in weeks. -Come on, sleep it off. -A working man deserves a little comfort in the evening. -If you were working, I might agree. Now, go on. Get up into bed. I have to go home and tuck Chloe in. Go. -Oh, Addie. -Come on. -Thanks for the ride, Dad. Bye, Mr. Saxton. -Behave yourself, now. [doorbell] -Jeanette, can you get the door, please? Yeah. No, call everyone in, OK? I don't care about the overtime. Keep the lab open all night if you have to, because we have to get the shipment out first-- [doorbell] Jeanette! -Daddy, it's after 8:00. Jeanette went home. -OK, this should have been done two days ago, OK? -Hi! -Hi! -Now, I don't want any discussion on it, just keep me posted. [honking] -Bye! Thanks you! -Hi, Mr. Duncan. -Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey-- I thought-- I thought it was gonna be our night tonight. -Now you can work all you want. -Tomorrow night, we watch a movie, OK? -OK. Fine. Fine. Whatever. -So Lindsay calls me and she's all crying because Cameron didn't call her tonight. She thinks he's hanging out with Madison. -You both purified? -Of course. -And you know we're doing me this time? -It's your turn. -OK, let's do it. All who enter the circle may do so in perfect love and perfect trust. Guardians of the east, masters of air, we call on you to witness our works and guard our circle. BOTH: We call on you. -Firm of purpose and pure intent. The same be said of he who's sent. -By the water in my blood and the rivers of the earth or the tides of the moon-- -Bring me one who knows my worth. MEGAN: Oh, Venus, goddess of love, please empower our prayer and send Gillian's true love to her. ALL: So must it be. So must it be. So must it be. So must it be. So must it be. [engine stalling] -Are you out of your mind? You about made roadkill out of me. -You OK? [phone ringing] -Hello? WES (ON PHONE): Addie, it's Wes. Addie? You there? -Did you pick up my dad again? -Yeah, he was riding his lawn mower drunk as a skunk down the highway. He caused a car accident. -Lawn mower. Did anybody get hurt? -Not this time. -I'll be right there. WES (ON PHONE): No, that's OK. He's sleeping it off. Come in the morning, and you may want to bring some bail money. -You know, Chelsea, sometimes I wonder if you're actually serious about this. -No, I totally am. It's just-- the spell, how long will it take to work? You know, if it works. -You can't say if. You have to believe it'll work, or it won't work. -Yeah, magic can't help you if you don't have faith in it. -You have to know you're one with nature so you can command it. If you don't know it, then you're wasting your time, and you shouldn't be in our coven. -So do you believe in magic or not? -Yes. -You have to believe with all your heart and soul and mind and body. -I do. I was just asking, how long will it take a person to fall in love with you? -Gillian and I did a spell to get Mrs. Elliott to stop making our lives miserable in chemistry, and 10 days later, she quit. Just like that. -I don't think it'll take 10 days for this spell. -How do you know? -Because I can't wait that long. -You should have seen old Roy's face when he watched that car go into the plaza. -You wouldn't happen to have a pay phone around here, would you? Maybe call my insurance company. -You don't have a cell? -There's a pay phone down the hall, by the restrooms. -Thank you. -Not real talkative, is he? -Not like yourself, you mean. -What? Hey, Addie. -I'm here to pick up my dad. -Yeah. Hey. Hello. ATM would only let me take out 500 for bail. -Wes, did you tell this young lady that we were charging Roy? -Well, I was just about to tell her that I was joking about that. You know we don't want to keep Roy here in the lockup. He snores too damn loud. -So how are you? -Can I take him home, then? -I'll go get him. Try and keep him away from the whiskey, though. -I never thought he'd take the lawn mower to the parking store. I'm sorry. -I'm not the one you should be apologizing to. Jack McBradden, good Samaritan. He's the one that helped your father our after the accident. Kept him from being roadkill. -They, uh-- they said you crashed your car because of my dad. -It wasn't that big a deal. -No. Here, let me, uh, pay for the damage. It's 500 to start. I'm sure it's gonna be more. -No. I-- I mean, I don't even have an estimate yet. So-- -Take it. Please. Are you hungry? -Let me get that for you. -Thank you. I really am sorry about all this. -If he's got to be stuck somewhere, he might as well be stuck here. -Oh, I don't think he'll be stuck here. Bob's a great mechanic. -I'm stuck here. Why shouldn't you? -Ignore him. He's still-- -Two sheets to the wind? Last night I was three sheets. Down to two. That's progress. -Thank goodness for progress. Where were you coming from? -Uh, north of here. -Oh. You live up there? -Not anymore. I'm a school teacher. -Oh. -History. -Ah. -I was laid off. -Oh. That's rough. So you're headed to greener pastures, then? -California. -Well, you still have a long way to go. The garage opens early. We can stop in and see if Bob has an estimate yet. I'll tell him if he gives you a good deal, he can eat free at the diner for a month. -Have you seen that man eat? We'll be bankrupt in a week. -You're allowed an opinion when you're down to one sheet. -You're good with him. -He's a good man. Don't tell him I said that. I want him thinking I'm furious for that stunt he pulled last night. -So next time it's Chelsea's turn. What kind of spell do you want for you? -Yeah, what do you really, really want? Thomas McAfee? Isn't he a little lame? -He's all right. He just helps me with chemistry. -Hey. You guys know what's cool? -What? -That no one here knows we're witches. They all look at us and just think we're ordinary. But we're not. -Wouldn't that be horrible? If we were ordinary, if we were powerless to change anything? We should cast a spell on Thomas to make him cooler. -Or taller. -I thought witches aren't supposed to cast spells on other people. You know, interfere with their free will. -Yeah, but don't you think that Thomas would want to be cool? Witches are supposed to use their powers to help others. -Take a seat at the counter. I'll get you a coffee. MEGAN: Right, Gillian? Gillian? -Addie, the chili in my omelette had an extra kick today. Tell Delilah I approve. -Sure will. Thanks, Jordan. -It worked. The spell. He's here. -I don't suppose you know of any super-cheap motels in the area, do you? -Maybe now you'll let me pay for the damage to your car. -No. No, honestly it really wasn't all your father's fault. I was driving too fast. I was trying to-- anyway, I'll come up with the money. Find some odd jobs around town. -Well, if you're willing to wash dishes and peel potatoes, you got a job right here. There's an extra room upstairs. You can have room and board too. I'm sorry. You teach history, and I'm asking you to be a dishwasher. -Believe it or not, that's, um, one of the better offers I've had lately. -My phone is dead. I need to use your phone, please. -Here. -You'll take the job? -I'll take the job. Yeah. [snapshot] -Gillian. -Sorry. He looks familiar. I thought he might be famous. -Are you famous? -Don't be silly. This is Jack. He's just stopping by on his way to California. -California, really? -Jack, this is Gillian Duncan. If you trying on an apron, you'll be seeing here. Her and her friends are here most every day. -You're gonna work here? -Just for a week or so till Bob Minielli gets his car fixed. You girls on tab? -Yeah, thanks. -Welcome to Salem Falls. Mm. You'll like it here. I promise. Thanks. -It's not her fault if she acts entitled. Her father's Amos Duncan, as in, uh, Duncan Pharmaceuticals. As in he owns half the town. -Ah. The girl who has everything. -Well, everything except what she really wants. Her mother left town when she was little. So she's-- she's a girl without a mother. You good? -Yeah, thank you. -It's him. He's the one. -How do you know? What did he say? -Well, his car broke down here last night after we did the spell. He was on his way to California. -Where did I always say I'm going to live? -California. But after you graduate. -Well, so what? I don't need to wait that long now. -Gillian, he's, like, 35. -Exactly! He's a man not a boy. Ugh! And did you see how gorgeous he is? You watch. When he goes to California, I'm going with him. -Here. We rent these rooms out in the summer. If you don't like it, there's another one down the hall. -This is fine. -Good. Yeah, the other one's next to my dad's room, and he snores. -I like it very much. -My daughter helped me decorate it. -You have a daughter? -Her name's Chloe. She's six. She picked out the rocking horse. I'll let you get settled. And, uh, I'll show you what's what in the diner after the breakfast rush. -Thank you. -OK. -Addie's got you tucked away nice and cozy. -Yeah. She said you wouldn't mind if I bunked up here for a little while. -Did she tell you I go a little crazy up here all by myself? -Something like that. -Yeah, well, it's been too damn quiet around here lately. -I can't imagine it's that quiet with a six year old running around. -Yeah, Chloe did run up and down this hallway. Put her dolls down for a nap in this very room. That was before. -Before what? -Before she died. -I'm sorry. I thought Addie said-- -Addie can't swallow it down yet. She still talks about her like she's in the next room, even though it's been close on three years. We all have our ghosts, Jack. -Sorry about the long wait for parts. The radiator's got to come all the way from Chicago. -Uh, you know what? It's fine. I'll be staying at the Do-or-Diner if you need to reach me. -Grafton County Jail. What do you know? My cousin's the corrections officer up there. You in that line of work? -No. No, I, uh, did some teaching up there. -Well, I'll bet you got some interesting stories to tell. Larry says it's a real piss hole. -He's right about that. -Have a nice day now. Dale, try sweeping the floor. Don't just tickle it. -I got you. -Oh, that's great. Thanks a lot. -Listen, I hope I haven't, uh, given you the impression I'm ungrateful. -You haven't given me any impression at all. You barely speak. -It's a bad habit. Um, see, you've been so generous to me. I-- I don't know why. -Most people are generous. -Yeah, but you hardly even know me. -I know you ran out of luck. And I don't mind you being here till it finds you again. Don't-- take away her food. Pancakes are Chloe's favorite. -That was such a lovely service. You really know how to keep this flock inspired. It is such a pleasure to see everyone so full of the spirit. -Can we go now? -What has gotten into you? -I told you I was hungry. -Can we please go now? -Yes. Sure, sure. We'll head on over to the bistro. I know how much you love the lobster salad. -No. You promised we'd go to the diner, remember? -Gillian, do we have to, honey? -You promised. -Yes. Yes. Fine. Well, it can't be that bad if Jerry's here. You know, that guy has never missed a day at work in his life because of sickness. -Fine. Just sit. -Jerry! So-- hello. -Can I get you a coffee to start, Mr. Duncan? -Uh, do you have a cappuccino? I'll have a decaf. -Sure. -Iced tea, please. -OK. -OK. -Thanks, Maggie. AMOS: So you are expert. What do you recommend here? -Um, their breakfast is really good. -Yeah? I'm not seeing fruit salad here. -Here you go. -I don't think they have that, Dad. -I'll be back to take your order in just a minute. -Thank you. -There's no yogurt or-- -Uh, no. -Mr. Duncan. Gillian. -Hey, Wes. Hi. Good to see you. -Yeah. Yeah. What a surprise. -I'm just gonna get more sugar for my iced tea. I'll be back. Hi. -Hi. -Can I get some more sugar, please? Thank you. When do you get off? WES: You know, we get our meeting coming up for the annual fundraiser. I'd sure love to have your support. AMOS: We'll talk about it later. WES: Enjoy your breakfast. -Who's that? -Nobody. Just some new guy Addie hired. Let's go. I'm over it. -Hey, hey, hey. I thought we were gonna eat here. GILLIAN: I lost my appetite. AMOS: Have a seat. Sit down. Hey. Gillian, Gillian. -Come on. -Hold on a second. Hold on. Gillian. Gillian. -What? -Stop! Did I say something? -No, it's fine. -OK, what happened? -Stop controlling me. -I'm not controlling you. -Please. -Please. I'm walking home. -No, no. What are you-- -I'm walking home alone. -Gillian, Gillian-- -Wes, you want to put a to-go order? -Actually, I was hoping maybe I could talk you into taking a break. Stepping out, taking a walk with me. -No, I can't. I can't leave Maggie to juggle all these tables. -Even a workaholic has to take a break. I'm starting to take it personally you keep saying no. -No, I mean, even if it wasn't busy, I've got to get Chloe to come in and eat her lunch. Did you want anything? -If you're gonna blow me off, don't do it with this make-believe crap. -Here you go. Chloe's fries. -Thank you. Delilah needs to see you in the kitchen. -Yeah. It's-- it's crazy. -You know, you helping Addie with this whole fantasy world, it's not going to make things better. -Hello, Gillian. -Hi. -No Megan and Chelsea today? -No, not today. Um, I need another book of spells. -Oh. Well, the one you have is our most popular. -No, I want a book just of love spells, nothing else. -You always impressed me with how well you understood the purpose of Wicca. You know, spell casting is just a small part. -Yeah, but right now I feel like I, um-- I need to align with this energy that's swirling inside me. I, um-- I feel like the goddess is opening my heart, and I want to tap into that, you know? -I have just the book for you. -Thank you. -Just because I'm here 14 hours a day doesn't mean you have to be. -I like it here. -Oh! -I got it. I got it. I'll hold it. You get that last screw out. -I got the wrong size bulbs. I got you. -God, you've only been here a few days, and I'm already wondering how we ever got along without you. -I was gonna make some hot chocolate. Should I make some for Chloe? -I used to make her hot chocolate at closing time most every night. -Used to. But you don't anymore? -I know she's dead. I may say and do differently, but I know. -I'm sorry. I-- you don't have to talk about it. -I don't usually. She woke up one morning with a sore throat, and nine hours later, she was gone-- bacterial meningitis. I know she-- I know she doesn't eat the food that I put out for her. But I can still feel her here, so I put the food out. Most people think I'm crazy. -It's not crazy for you to keep space for her in your life. -I never go to the cemetery. Because I-- I don't believe that she's there. What kind of a mother doesn't go to her daughter's grave? -I'm sorry. I-- I'm gonna get that bulb. -I can make that hot chocolate, if you still want some. -I'd like that. Yeah. -OK. -Is that a smile I see? I didn't know you had one. -Yeah. It was broken for a while. Roy. You got a minute? -Mr. McBradden, what are you doing here? -Waiting for you, actually. -Oh, is that right? What can I do for you? -Um, I've decided to stay in Salem Falls indefinitely. -Oh. Well, That's great. This town has a way of growing on you. -Uh, I'm here because of 671-B. -Well, you'd better come in, then. We'll have to take your photo. -Hey, guys. I wrote Jack's name on this parchment. Now all I have to do is roll something up in it that Jack has just touched all between two rose petals, say the spell, and that's it. A magic poesy that'll make Jack see that he loves me. -But you already did a love spell on him. -Well, that was a spell to bring him to me. Now I have to do one to bind him to me. -I still don't get why you're so into this guy. -It's fate. We're supposed to be together. -So why not wait for fate to unfold? -Why wait if I don't have to? Isn't that why we became witches? To make things happen? Come on. Let's do this. -Hey! Stop it. -Oh my gosh. Oh my god. I'm so sorry. -That's OK. -I made such a mess. I'm so sorry. -Oh, yeah. So convincing. -You know what, leave it. I got it. -No, no. -No, no. GILLIAN: I'm so sorry. Oh my gosh. I'm sorry. I'm s-- um, here. Take a napkin. -Gonna need more than a napkin. -OK. -But you didn't get anything he touched. -Not yet. -Eggs. -Hey, you're still wet. Let me help you. -I'm fine. -What's going on? -One to seek him, one to find him, one to bring him, one to bind him. Whoever keeps these roses two, the sweetest love will come to you. -What are you doing down here? -I was just washing my hands. -In the men's room? -Oh, is it? I didn't even notice. -What is that? -Nothing. -What are you hiding? -Nothing. Give it back. -My diner's not your playground, Gillian. It's time for you and your friends to go. Go. -We're leaving. -OK. -Grab that. -Doesn't squeak anymore. -It took me 20 minutes to figure out what the problem was. -Dad said you've decided to stay. -Yeah. For a while anyway. -I'm glad. -Listen, Addie, there's something I need to tell you. It's, um-- -I, uh-- I went to the florist after the lunch rush today. For Chloe's grave. So I thought I'd close early and go to the cemetery. Will you come with me? -Of course. Let me, uh-- let me just get my coat. -What do you think happens after you die? Because I used to believe in reincarnation, but after Chloe, I-- I don't want her to be anybody else. She's got to be somewhere, right? -Oh, I think so. If you love somebody, they're with you. If you keep space for them in your heart, that's where they'll always be. -Yeah, I like that. -Want me to-- -Thank you. [music playing] -Hello. -You look great. How are you? [snapshot] --you were gonna kiss me. -You mean, I could just keep you waiting like this for hours? -Probably. Wait a minute. Hey, now. -I don't know what to do. What do I do? -What do you mean someone stole your spell? -My love spell, the poesy I made, someone took it, and now my true love is all over her. -Gillian, then he isn't your true love. Magic can't make anything happen that isn't already leaning that way. -Just-- tell me how to undo the spell. -You know that Beltane is coming up-- one of the most sacred of all days for Wiccans. -I know, but the spell-- -If you're interested in spell work, you should be interested in Beltane. Any spell cast on that day will have extra power. -Really? As I cut their tie, let the bond between them be broken. As I burn the tie, let the bond be forever severed. So must it be. So must it be. -Hey, oh! -Sorry. I wasn't paying attention. -Yeah, so I see. I guess I'll go around for a towel holder in the men's room. -Thank you. I think it's time to call it a day. -You're the boss. -Wes, w were just about to close up. -I'm here on official police business, Addie. You know why I'm here. So you're gonna tell her or should I? -OK, what's this about? -I was in prison for eight months. -I'm sure you can explain it. -He raped a 16-year-old girl, Addie. -OK, that can't be true. -Oh, no. See, he admitted it. Pled guilty to avoid a longer sentence. He comes into the office yesterday to register as a sex offender. -Jack. -I-- -Oh my god. -Addie. Addie-- -Don't. Don't. Don't even-- -Hey. Why don't you do Addie a favor, huh, and just leave? Go out that door and start walking and don't stop until you cross the town line. [knocking] -I didn't do it. My lawyer talked me into taking a plea bargain, convinced me it was my only option. The boarding school where I taught in Loyal, there was a student of mine, a minister's daughter who made up stories about me. I never touched her. Addie, you have to know, I could never do that to anyone. -I never thought he would either. -Who? -The man who did it to me. Do you want to come in? I just turned 17. And I was naive. So I didn't understand when someone was coming on to me. I didn't understand that it was a bad idea to follow him into a room where no one could-- you know. -And you never told anyone? -No. -Why not? -Because I was young and scared. And then I was pregnant. And I didn't want anyone to know that Chloe-- yeah. -The guy who did this, does he still live here? -You want to slay my dragons, Jack? -Yes. -Well, you can't. Not that one. It doesn't matter anymore. I got, uh-- I got Chloe out of it. [doorbell] [knocking] GILLIAN: I'll get it. -Hey, hey. More popcorn. -Hey, come on in. Dad, it's Wes. -Wes? -Sorry to trouble you, Mr. Duncan, but there's something I think you should know, concerning one Jack McBradden. This McBradden is a registered sex offender. He raped a 16-year-old girl less than a year ago. -You're gonna stay away from that diner. You got me? I mean it. I don't want anything to happen to you. -OK. -I'm calling a town meeting. -I fell asleep on your couch. -We-- we talked till after midnight last night. You were tired. -You should have woke me up, told me to go home. -I wanted to let you sleep. -Well, thank you. I-- I can't remember the last time I slept that well. What time is it? -It's time to open the diner. -OK. Do you mind if I hitch a ride with you? -No, it's-- it's so nice out I thought I'd walk. Um, there's a shortcut through the woods. It takes, like, 10 minutes. So if you're ready. -Yeah. -Um, I appreciate everything you said last night. I believe you. JACK: I had a father, of course, who was convinced I should be just like him and go into politics. -A politician? Wow. I can't picture you doing that. Pontificating. -Well, you haven't seen me pontificate in a classroom. -Ah. -Once you get me started, then I'll never-- -They came in the middle of the night. -This is my mess to clean up. -How long have you known? -Thanks. -Jack told me the night before last. He said he cared about you and wanted to stay. But he had to register as a sex offender. -He, uh, wondered if I thought it would be better for you if he left. -So what'd you tell him? -I hoped that he would stay for as long as he liked. -I'm gonna go see if he needs any help. -My car's packed. I'm ready to go. Let me come away with you. Come on, we'll go to California. I know you want to get out of here. So do I. -How's it going out-- -Gillian, listen to me. --here? What was that about? -Nothing. -Last night, you told me I could ask you anything, and you'd answer me. -She told me her who incited the men who did this. And that he'd get them to do worse if I didn't go. -So she came here to threaten you? -No, actually, she-- she came here to offer to help me leave. She said that she would give me her car to drive to California if I would take her with me. -She wanted to run away with you? -I know. It's ridiculous. Girls that age, they live in some kind of fantasy land. -Do they? You were just touching her. -Yeah, I was pushing her away, trying to get through to her. Listen, with the girl at Loyal, I was so concerned about hurting her feelings that I didn't-- I-- I wanted Gillian to know without a doubt that I want nothing to do with her. This isn't coming off. As soon as I saw this, I knew I should leave. I'm not wanted here. But I don't want to leave. This is where I want to be. -Gilly, you realize that first period starts in, like, 10 minutes. -We're skipping first period. We have to go get supplies. Ah, ribbons, herbs, rosemary, primrose, bloodstone. -Cool, but for what? -Tonight's Beltane. We have spells to cast. -Delilah, I need that food. -I don't know the last time we were this busy. -They've all come to golf with the governor. -Well, he needs to tell them to piss off. -You're harboring a convicted sex offender here. -Get out of my diner. -I'm not the problem here. He is. and you-- you're putting the children of this town in danger. -All right, just because you've crowned yourself emperor of Salem Falls doesn't mean you can come in-- -I have the right of a parent who is protecting his daughter from an animal. Now, maybe you don't understand that anymore, do you? -I have a daughter. -No, you don't anymore. -Get out of my diner! -Hey. -Get back. -She asked you to leave. -Or what? Because you will go back to prison so fast, you won't know what hit you. You either get rid of him right now, or I'll take care of the problem myself. It doesn't matter-- the legion, the community hall, the church. I just need a space big enough, and we need to find it quickly. Hold on a second. Hey, where you going? -Megan's to finish out history project. -I don't want you wandering around after dark, OK? There's a sex offender out there. It's dangerous. -Megan's dad's the chief of police. I think I'll be safe. -OK, I'll pick you up after my meeting. -No, I have my car. -Gillian. I'm picking you up, OK? There's a lot of unrest out there right now. Or there will be soon enough, and-- look, OK? Just be careful out there. -Go on. Run home and tell my daughter. -I'll have what he's having. -Does Addie know you're here? -About as much as she knows you're here. -You best not be about to break her heart. -Yeah, well, what if she breaks mine, Roy? Hm? What are you gonna do then? -Buy you a drink. Here. Give him another one. [music playing] [laughing] -Isn't it great? You guys ready? -I've lived with the people of Salem Falls my whole life. And I've always known this to be a good and decent place to raise children. Until yesterday. Yesterday I learned that a stranger has slipped into our midst to live among us-- a stranger with evil in his heart, a stranger who even now is waiting. He is waiting right now for his moment to strike. -Sky clad means naked. It's about offering your purest self. It's OK. -It feels good. -Guardians of the watchtowers of the self, passionate and hot, I do summon and call you up. Share your heat with us. Make us burn inside. -Bring us your imagination. Teach us to dance. Fill us with your fire. Raise your flames to the sky. ALL: We call on you. We call on you. We call on you. -This is our home. I mean, these are our children. They are innocent, they're naive, they're capable of being manipulated. This is exactly the kind of children that men like this prey upon. Yes? Yes, Linda? -How are we supposed to know who his next target is? -I don't know. -I don't want no pervert here. -No one wants him here. Am I right? [applause] AMOS: Let him go to Concord. Or to Boston or New York. It's where his kind live. That is where his kind belong. [applause] ALL: Oh, great mother goddess, give us your power in this magic hour. -We call on you to hear our plea. I call on you to bring my love to me. ALL: We call on you. -Jack McBradden has no place in Salem Falls. And it is up to us to make sure he knows that. -Excuse me. Pardon me. I need to run home and punish my son for the things he hasn't done yet. -McAfee, you got a problem? -No. No. No, I've always thought Charlie should start arresting more people around here, just in case they, you know, might break the law in the future. -What? -In fact, I might just shut down my law practice, since you all know who's going to commit a crime. You can run them out of town before they do. Hell, we don't really even need a legal system at all, do we? -Jack McBradden pled guilty. When he hurts another girl, what are you going to say then? I don't know about you, but when I find a snake in my basement, I don't wait until it bites. I get rid of it. [applause] And we need to get rid of Jack McBradden. -Fire, I command thee. Fill my love with the heat of passion for me. Wind, I command thee, whisper my name into his ear. Earth, I command thee, show him the way to find me. As I will it, so must it be. ALL: So must it be. -Gillian, my god. You're glowing. [twigs snapping] -Someone's coming. -It's a wolf. -It's not a wolf. -We can't get busted doing anything ritual. My dad will lose it. -Gilly, come on. Hurry. Let's go. Come on. -He's coming to me. Jack. -Gillian! -You're lucky that didn't turn into a riot. And the next time you call a town meeting, I expect you to get a permit so I can bring an extra man. -I'm not asking permission to talk to my neighbors, Charlie. You should know that. I'll be by your house in a few minutes to pick up Gillian. -What are you talking about? Gillian's not at my house. -She's doing a project with Megan. -Right. At your house. [sirens] AMOS: That's her car. That's it. That's her car. Gillian? Gillian! -Megan? -Gillian! -We're over here. -What are you doing out here? What's wrong? What happened? What happened to her? Sweetheart. -It was Jack. -What? He raped me. -No, no. -He raped me, Daddy. -Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh, no. No. [sobbing] -What happened to your head? -Oh. I walked through a tree coming back from the Rooster Spit. -What were you doing at the Rooster Spit? -Getting way too drunk. Addie, tell me what you want me to do. You want me to go, I'll go. If you want me to stay, I'll do it. I'll do anything you want. -Don't go. [music playing] -I just got Judge Abbott out of bed. I'm taking a warrant to him to get his signature. -I'm gonna castrate this son of a bitch. -Don't start with that vigilante business, Amos. I'll have McBradden behind bars within the hour. -Daddy. Daddy. [sobbing] -It's OK. You're gonna be OK. You're gonna be OK. -Daddy! -Morning. [knocking] -That's weird. Coming. [knocking] Charlie, what can I do for you? -Addie, we're looking for Jack McBradden. Jack McBradden? -What is this? -We have a warrant for your arrest. -For what? -Aggravated sexual assault. -No. No, I did my time. -On Gillian Duncan last night. -What? -She was attacked, Addie. Says it was McBradden. Out in the woods behind the house. -This is a joke, right? -I wish to god it was. Jack McBradden-- -Addie, I never touched her. --you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say will be used against you in a court of law. -Addie, Addie. I gotta talk to Addie. -You're done talking to Addie. -Addie! I didn't do it. Addie! -Oh. -Was it bad? All the tests and everything? -Yeah, it was bad. It sucked. My dad asked me all these questions about what we were doing out there. -Oh, my god. They're going to find out we're witches. Out in the woods naked. We'll be the town freaks. -No. We got all the ribbons and stuff out of the tree. They're not going to find out. As long as we all have the same story. Which is? -We were bored and wanted to go hang out in the woods. -They've all come to gawk again. This time at me. Crazy Addie. -You shouldn't have come in today. -What else am I gonna do? -Take a minute, catch your breath, go visit Jack, try to find out what really happened. -Charlie and Wes told me what happened. And now he's in jail where he belongs. -You could give the man the benefit of the doubt for two seconds. -I did. The first time when he told me he was innocent, and yesterday when I saw him touching Gillian. As far as I'm concerned, Jack no longer exists. Now, I have customers to take care of and Chloe to feed. -I hear you're not cooperating with the powers that be here. -What, the orange jumpsuit? I'm not putting it on, OK? I'm not guilty. I don't want to look like someone who is. -Well, you're not off to a good start. -Why are you here? -I help out the public defender when they have a conflict of interest. -And you're taking mine? -I haven't decided yet. What do you plan to plea? -I just told you I didn't rape anyone. -That wasn't the question. How do you want to plead? -Not guilty. -You copped a plea the last time. Why not now? -That was a mistake. I should never have let my lawyer talk me into that. I was wrongly accused. -Two years in a row. That's pretty rotten luck, wouldn't you say? -Yeah, I would. And the last thing I need is another lawyer that doesn't care that I'm innocent. -It doesn't matter if I care or not. You're still entitled to a defense. -It matters to me. Gillian Duncan lied, OK? I-- I don't know why. I don't know what she has against me. But I didn't do it. If you're looking for a quick case you can just charge to the county, forget about mine. I want somebody who's going to fight for me. -Well, Charlie said he'd drop Megan off to ride in with you. -You don't have to go back to I can take time off work. I can hang out here with you. -No. I'll go crazy if I have to sit around here and think about it. -You know that I would give anything to be able to drive Jack McBradden from your mind, right? -I have to go get ready. -Oh, just cut off the brown part. Jordan. -Sorry for invading the inner sanctum, but, uh, I got a note for you. It's from Jack. -You saw him? -I'm defending him. -I-- Jordan-- -Well, in case you want to read it later. -Well, I want to know what it says. -Loyal? I guess he wants you to stand by him. -That school where he taught where that girl said he-- was in a town called Loyal. -Oh, great mother goddess, hear my plea. Oh, great mother goddess, hear my plea. [music playing] [doorbell] -Gillian? Gillian? -Coming. Ready for school. -Gillian, your-- your hair. -Let's go. -You're going out of town? But you never leave. -And who's going to be in charge? This old drunk? Well, he did used to run the place. -You're going to Loyal, aren't you? -Gotta find out the truth about him. -Wait, this is about Jack? Oh my god, you're crazy. -What if you don't like what you find? -Then all I've lost is time. -OK, so you down some drinks with Roy, you're walking home, through the trail in the woods, and you see a fire. -Right. And three girls. -Doing what? -uh, just standing by the fire. Two of them took off as soon as they saw me. I didn't get a good look at them. My plan was to just keep on walking. And then the last girl called me by my name, and that's when I realized it was Gillian. -And you didn't keep walking? -No. I should have, especially once I realized she had no clothes on. -And then what happened? -When you ran off with Megan, why didn't Gillian go with you? -I don't know. I told Megan we shouldn't leave her. -So did you go back? -No. -The flashlight went out. And we were scared. -And? Look, I know being questioned like this can be difficult, uncomfortable. -It's OK. I'd do anything for Gilly. -Um, I-- I mean, it's a little tough to remember because I was drunk, but she said something about the fire, and I thought she wanted help putting the fire out. So I went over to it. And then she grabbed me by the hand and said that she wanted me to jump over the fire with her. -She what? -It's crazy. -Well, as a matter of fact, the jury's gonna-- -I told her that too. I said, you know, this is crazy. I said, you know, this is crazy. I pulled away. And that's when she grabbed me and tried to kiss me. -You're saying she grabbed you? She was forcing herself onto you? -Yeah. You don't believe me, do you? -I don't think a jury's gonna believe you. -Gillian said she was yelling no, no, stop. Did you hear that? -You have no idea how awful it was when she came out of the woods, and she was-- she was crying, shaking so hard. And I was holding onto her arm, and she was just-- just shaking. -It's OK. It's OK. -Are you sure? -Yes, I'm sure. Gillian is a liar. -There were two other girls there that night. What if they don't corroborate your story? What, are you going to call them liars too? ADDIE: My daughter's been at Exeter. But her father and I would prefer it if she was closer to home. -An Exeter girl? Well, I'm sure she'd be a definite asset to Westbrook. -We, uh-- we do have one concern. She plays soccer. And we read that the soccer coach who was also the history teacher, I believe, was convicted of a sexual assault of one of the students. -An unfortunate situation, but that teacher is no longer associated with the school. -Can you tell me more about what happened? -There are privacy issues. But rest assured, it won't happen again. Let me show you the science wing. -It's beautiful. -Yes. -Hi. I was wondering if you can help me. -Are you somebody's mother? -Yeah, I am looking at the school for my daughter. And she's a soccer player. Can you-- can you tell me about the coach? That coach. -Um, Coach McBradden isn't the coach anymore. He had to leave. -Yeah, why? -All of us girls, we had a crush on coach, you know. -Yeah, he's very good looking. -Yeah, and Katherine had it really bad. And it's like, who would have thought he was hot for her too? -So-- so they were together? -Yeah. I think so. I mean, that's what we were told. -Which one's Katherine? -Number 19. Right there. ADDIE: Oh. Hm. Well, thank you. -You're welcome. -You said you never touched Gillian. -I didn't. -Your DNA was found under her fingernails. -Well, yeah. Well-- I told you, she grabbed me to try to kiss me. I pulled away. She tried to grab on. She must have scratched me. -What, did she grab your head? -No. I did that on a branch. -Then why was your blood on her shirt? -Before I went to the fire, she saw that I was bleeding, and she came up and she dabbed my forehead with her shirt. -What shirt? You said she was naked. -She picked it up off the ground. -Fine, Jack. Now tell me why your semen was found on her. -What? No, that's impossible. -The chance of randomly selecting an individual other than the test subject or relative whose DNA matches the evidence collected is 740,000 to 1. Time to start telling the truth, Jack. -Katherine? Hi, I'm Addie Peabody. Um, I was gonna come up with some story, but I'd rather just be straight with you. -I'm sorry. What are you talking-- -I need to ask you about Jack McBradden. -You know Mr. McBradden. -Katherine! How many times have I told you, you are not to discuss that man with anyone. Ever. -But Daddy, this lady was just asking-- -You have no right. That man ruined my daughter. You want to know about Jack McBradden? He pulls angels out of heaven and drags them down for a fall. -Dad. -I hope he rots in hell. -Is it true? Did Jack force himself on you? -Katherine. [knocking] -I don't want my dad to hear us. So how was it when you gave your statements? -Uh, I don't know. It was OK, I guess. -OK, good. -It was weird-- getting grilled by my dad, I-- I don't know, I just had this urge to tell him that Jack had touched me too. -He didn't touch you. Do you understand? He touched me. Say it. -He touched you. -That's right. Don't forget. Come here. It's gonna be OK. -I don't think I can do this. -Excuse me, Addie? -Ready to order? I just have to get my pen. FEMALE SPEAKER: Addie? -Yeah, just a second. Uh, hello. -Hi. Can I help you? -I hope so. Um, I took this from a girl in my diner. And your store's name is on it. I was hoping you could tell me what it is. -You're the one who took Gillian's poesy. -Addie! Addie! Addie! -Over here. -There you are. What's with the big emergency? -I talked to Carol Willis at Crystal Cavern. And she said that the night of Gillian's attack was Beltane. -Bel-what? -Beltane. It's this holy night for Wiccans where they run ribbons from maypoles or trees. And you said that Jack said he saw streamers in trees, right? -Yeah, but there was nothing here the next morning. -Look at this. How could they miss this? Carol also said Gillian's been buying books on love spells. Yeah, Jack is telling truth. -Aw. -Oh. You. -I need to talk to you. Why would you lie about something like that? -Because my father found my birth control pills. My dad's a minister, you know. So that was not good. And then he started snooping around till he found my diary-- all this stuff I had written about Jack. I had this thing for him. And I'd write these stories as if he was actually into me-- you know, like, in love with me. And none of it was real, but when my dad confronted me about it, I pretended it was real. I just-- I wanted him to think I was having this grown-up affair-- just for a second. I had no idea he was actually going to call the police. And I did tell the truth later. I told my father, the police, everyone that it never happened. I had made it up. They didn't listen. -You didn't try very hard. -I did. I swear. They thought I was trying to protect Jack because I was so in love with him. I just-- I didn't want to see him get in trouble. They were so determined on doing this trial. And then-- Jack said he did it. In court. A, um-- -A plea bargain. -Right. Right. And so, I mean, if he wasn't going to deny it, then why should I keep denying it? Why not just act like that's the truth? -Because, Catherine, it's wrong. You let a man go to prison for something he didn't do. -Well, I heard he got arrested again for the same thing. So I guess I'm not the only one, huh? [buzzer] -You should her telling Charlie. He had no chance but to let her see you. -I'm afraid to believe you're actually here. -I'm here. -Why? -I owe you an apology. When they arrested you, you were calling my name. And you wanted to talk to me. And I just shut down. -I don't blame you for that. -I know what it's like to have everything go wrong for such a long time that you think that you don't deserve any kindness. But you deserve to have the person who says she loves you stand by you. -You never said you love me. -But I do. I love you, Jack. And I'm so sorry I turned away from you. -Addie, you're all I've been thinking about. -I know you didn't hurt Gillian. I'm gonna prove it. -I love you for But according to Jordan, between the DNA evidence and my prior conviction, it's a lost cause. -No. No, I know what a lost cause is, and this isn't one of them. When I lost Chloe, I had no choice. I have a choice with you. And I'm not going to lose you. CHELSEA: Gillian. Gillian. -Calm down. -Well, are you mad? -Tell me what you said to Thomas McAfee-- exactly what you said. -Just that we were witches. That we had a coven, and-- -You are so stupid, Chelsea. His dad is Jack's lawyer. -Well, how was I supposed to know that? -Everyone knows that. Why would you-- why would you tell him? You swore blood you'd never tell. -I was scared of everything you've been doing. -You didn't tell him that, did you? -No. But we can't keep it a secret forever. -I don't like all this lying. -You guys are ruining everything. -OK, stop it. -What? -Gillian, maybe it needs to be ruined. I don't even know why we went along with this in the first place. -Oh, shut up. You were all for it that night we were taking the ribbons off the trees. -Yeah. To see if we could get away with it. But-- it's way out of control. -No. You are out of control. And if either of you dare say what really happened that night, I swear to god, I will make sure you live to bitterly regret it. Do you understand me? -Catherine said her father will never let her recant. I met him. He's very insistent Jack be the bad guy. But her birthday's in two months. And as soon as she's 18, she's willing to talk to whatever judge we find to overturn the conviction. If we file a motion to delay Jack's trial just a few months-- -Look, I don't want you to think that the Catherine think isn't great, because it is. But we still have those witnesses who are corroborating Gillian's story. -They were practicing witchcraft. -Yeah, but being a witch doesn't mean you're a liar. -No. But it means they lied to the police about what they were doing that night. Doesn't that impeach their credibility? -It might. But you know, there's still the problem of the DNA test results. -You said they were inconclusive. -Only mathematically speaking. As far as a jury goes, you know, that's a big finger pointing straight at Jack. I mean, the blood on Gillian's shirt, it's no doubt that's Jack's DNA, 6 billion to 1, along with the fingernail scrapings. -That doesn't mean sexual assault. Jack can explain them. -He can't explain the semen. I mean, the lab says, the chance of randomly selected a non-related individual whose DNA matches the evidence collected is 740,000 to 1. I mean, that's a really big number. -The DNA collected matches Gillian's DNA? -Yeah. -I have to go. -Go where? -Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. What the hell is this? -I need to talk to Gillian. I have something that belongs to her. -You shouldn't be here right now. -Don't touch me. -Hey. -Dad, I want to talk to her. -If you don't leave here right now, I'm calling the police. -Please do. I'll have plenty to tell them. I talked to Carol at the Crystal Cavern. She's willing to testify in court about the love spells you tried and your obsession with making Jack fall in love with you. -You do not have to listen to this. I can throw her out of here. -I know-- I know why you did it. I know why you wanted Jack to run away with you. I know why you'd hope he'd rescue you. -Run away? Tell her. Do you want to run away from here? Tell her. -Gillian, I didn't always work at the diner. When I was a teenager, I wanted to get away from it. So I got a job as a shipping clerk at the big pharmaceutical company in town. -Not to my daughter. -Your father-- -Not to my daughter. -Your father hired me. He was the owner's son. And he felt entitled to whatever was inside those walls. I know this because one day he decided he wanted me. -Addie, shut up. Shut up. -I was slow to understand at first. Then I was almost flattered. But when I said no, he wasn't going to take no for an answer. Then when I tried to leave, he took what he wanted anyway. Gillian, the semen that the found, if you go to the police, and you tell them who really put it there, they're going to get a DNA sample from him that'll prove it, and you can put the man who's actually been hurting you behind bars. -I'm so sorry that I didn't do that when I had the chance, because maybe then he wouldn't have done this to you. OK, but you need to drop charges against Jack. You can't let him go to prison for something he didn't do. And you know where to find me. -Why didn't you tell her the truth? That I don't hurt you? That I-- that I show you-- I show you how much I love you? -No, you don't. Sweetie, come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. -Don't. Don't! Don't! Get away! -Gillian. Gillian. Gillian! -Wait. Would you please take me to the police station right now? -Yeah, get in. -Gillian, Addie, come into my office, OK? [music playing]
