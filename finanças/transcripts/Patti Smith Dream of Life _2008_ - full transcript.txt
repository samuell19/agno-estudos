My whole being was raised in that search and I have the advantage of heaven that has the ability disappear , just blink , everything. Seeking omens and answers in the clouds. Seem to move quickly. Dome-shaped , connective tissue the side profile Art , the face of denial, bless her . Let's see if we can find the poem. I would read it. "I noticed the grass. I noticed the hills.

" And so we say goodbye to Allen Ginsberg, who called Gregory Corso, Smarter poet and irreverent of the Beat poets . He was our guide mystic in the labyrinth of language. When he died , was buried in Rome, at the foot of the poet Shelley, whom he adored . I remember going to a church with him and seeing the crucifix.

I think that while walking with my fatal shoes , Gregory and think , our sacred artist happily asleep at the foot of immortality.
