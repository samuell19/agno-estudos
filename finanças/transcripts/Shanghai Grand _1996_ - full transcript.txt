It just fits. Betrayer! Fainted! You are good at taking advantage! Will he be a rascal? It's not wise to offend triad members. There are bullets in the gun! Hide it, hurry up. If we are seen by the police, we will be put to jail. He's waken. Get up. I am not used to raise my head to look at others. Got it. Tell me, who are you? That's none of your business. You stole my gun. Return it to me. All of us here are heroes. We earn our living in this messy world, anyway, I am their boss. - Right. - That's right. You blame me of stealing your gun? You mean I am a thief! In Shanghai, only two kind of people are holding guns. Either cops, or thieves. Which type are you? Bull shit, return my gun to me! Brother lik, hand him to the police station, maybe we'll be awarded. Will they give us money? We have suffered much instead! Say that shorty chiu! He doesn't take any glance at us! Enough, shut up! Why not throw him to the river? So he will be bitten death by fishes! Lik. Lik, come and eat some dumplings. Eat while it's still hot. Don't just care of eating. Pack up for business now! Make money is more important! Mom, he seems to be hungry. Let him try some, to let him eat food cooked by our excellent cook! Alright. "Collection of love letters"! I taste the candy carefully. To see whether it is as sweet as your picture in my mind. Even a man is moved, a woman will be moved easily too. Today we only show to the soldiers, no ticket scalper today. There must be surplus too. So be a soldier, if you are a soldier, you will get a ticket. Bull shit! So what! Miss leung, good morning. Brother lik, good morning. Miss fung, good morning. I've bought tickets for you. Sorry, miss comes late. Now the movie has been started, we won't watch it today. Thank youl! You are going to miss a very good chance. I got front seats today! You can watch it without obstacles. Forget it! It's not a concert, front seats aren't attractive at all. Just sell the tickets, or it'll be a waste. Sell it? Alright... If you can't sell it, I'll pay you next time. - Forget it. - See you - bye bye. - See you. I've fooled him! Miss, I don't understand that, you have watched "gone with the wind" for three times. Why do you still enjoy watching it? The lead is like a person I knew. And I have different feelings whenever I watch it again. So what! Come out... hurry up. Hurry up! Get in. Bastard, are you looking for death? Let miss fung go. It's too dangerous. Hands off. Hurry up! Leave at once... Follow me. Don't go! Are you beating me? You bastard! - How dare you beat your boss? - Where is miss fung? - How dare you beat me? - Say! Tell me! Help! Go to hell! What are you doing? Why do you seize my car? What are you doing here? That bastard is too tough! He's a pain in the ass! Come out. I won't come out. Bastard! - I won't come out, never. - Come out. Bastard, you broke my tyre, I want you to pay for it. I tell you, this is imported from usa. I want you to pay for it, I make money by this. If you don't pay for it, I'll ask the cops to arrest you! It's not wise to offend me, you know? Pay! Mr. ting, Mr. fung will see you later. Mr. ting, Mr. fung will come out soon. Alright, thank you. Shorty chiu is a dog of brother wing. If not supported by wing, he didn't have guts to do such thing. What a mess! Women shouldn't be dragged by men! What a bastard! Watch miss. Before the case is settled, don't let her go out. Ask the owner of the cinema to show her the movie at home. Give the young man who saved ching ching some money. Watch him, he maybe in trouble. Yes, mister. My name is ting lik. I am the house keeper of Mr. fung. Mr. fung appreciates it very much, this is given by him. Money? No, please take it back. It's an appreciation from Mr. fung. If you refuse to take it, he will be unhappy. I know. But I can't take it. I did it not for money. Please tell miss fung, we are good friends. I am leaving. This way please. Have you ever been bitten by dog? It won't lose its mind and bite. Brother lik. Are you leaving? I've come for a long time. The big world is the territory of brother wing. Don't go there for movie any more. Come and see me only. Don't worry I will watch movie on every Wednesday. I just want to do anything which worries my daddy. You saved my life, how can I thank you? - Give me a hug. - What? It's a joke, bye! Can you send me something? - What do you want? - I've got it. What did you take? This letter has been written by me for a long time. I've kept it with me for days and didn't get a chance to give you. Don't watch here, go home and read carefully. Don't think of me. See you! How lucky I am! Wonderful! Come and put out the fire! Put out the fire! It's dangerous! Run now! Where is my mom? Where is she? Brother lik. Where is my mom? I can't find her! I can't find her. Why don't you take care of her? Why don't you save her? Brother lik, what are you doing? Get lost! Let me go! Brother lik, it's a big fire! Don't go! It's getting worse, brother lik! Get lost. It's dangerous, you can't go in, run! If you don't go now, it'll be too late! Drag lik out! Drag brother lik out, hurry up. Hurry up! Let me go! I want to save my mom! My mom is right in. - Let me go! - Come out first, brother lik your mom isn't inside, go out first. Let's go. Go! - Mom! - It's dangerous! No! Brother lik, go out. Get him out! Hurry up. Let me go. Stay calm first. She isn't your mom! That's why you don't care. Take a rest first. Brother lik, have some water. - Come on, drink some water. - It's hot. Are you hurt? Thank you, I am called ting lik. Everyone calls me brother lik. You saved my mom, I will protect you from now on. Fine. What's your name? Call me keung. Siu-keung, what a nice name! Brother wing said if we don't hand brother lik to him, he will burn any place we stay. So we can't make a living in Shanghai. I think this isn't a simple matter. Because we are staying in wing's territory. So he is pushing us to hand him brother lik. Do you want a beat up? Stop it. Take it back. You are so anxious, you must be in great need of it. I think you need it more than I do. His boss wing won't let you go. That's why he burnt your place. And he pushed your buddies to sacrifice you. What'll you do? He wants me only. My life doesn't worth much! Just take it. Mister, do you want any girl? Let me find a pretty one for you. Stop bothering me, I don't want any girl. You look nice! I am going to see the boss. Don't get yourself into trouble. Don't you worry I can't escape? I think, starting from tonight, we will be famous in Shanghai. I don't want others to know my name. I will call you chun from now on, so no one knows your name! - Brother lik. - Cheung-kwai, why are you here? I am going to do business in the tri-star. Put the gun inside his box. Bastard, you've come! I am coming to send brother wing some crabs. Check whether they are armed or not. Brother wing, they have come. You bastard! Crabs? You are giving me face to send me crabs! You can't escape this time. Bastard, I have waited you for a long time! Come on... let's play mahjong. Kid, where are you going? Someone inside wants the shoe shine service. No one needs you tonight! Leave! Get lost. Tri-star isn't suitable for children. I will play a game with you. Choose the biggest you can. Sixty thousand. Your turn. Just forty thousand? Do you wanna die? Let's see how far you can go! Sorry, you are so unlucky tonight. Damn it! How dare you betray me? Do you remember who raised you up? Damn it! Do you know it? Who is the boss here? Chiu is my brother, how dare you offend him? Don't you want to live any longer? Did you think with your ass? Did you eat shit? Let me hit you to wake you up! Don't you want to live? Draw any domino you like. Go ahead. You are like a dying dog! Open it. Show me. Just ten thousand. No! Don't kill! Go to hell. Bastard! Stop fighting! Have you fought enough? Freeze. Be frank! You cops can't take anyone away you like. Mr. chu, you've misunderstood it, we don't come for an arrest. Uncle lau invited me to eat crabs. Such nice crabs, let's finish it first. Uncle lau, you haven't come to have fun in tri-stars for a long time. How is Mr. fung? Mr. chu, you still remember Mr. fung. How can I forget him? But they killed brother wing here, if his fellows want me to hand them the murderer, what'll I do? You know, this is a place for fun only! If there is anything happened, that will... If you don't cover wing's gang, that'll be alright. I will take ting lik away. For the rest, we will deal with it. Brother four, what action will the police station take? What's the matter? Nothing has happened! I asked my fellows to clean the scene. Nothing has happened! Lik, from now on, the territories of wing will go to you. I will back you up. Shorty chiu can't hide up any longer. From now on, we will take over... The shit business in Shanghai! We will be rich! Well, for anything I get in Shanghai I want to share it with you. I am only a visitor in Shanghai. I will leave this place when my work is finished. Let's wait and see. Maybe, you don't want to leave for something unknown. Is that ok? I haven't done such thing before.

What's her name? Fung ching-ching. Will she marry you? Of course! How can she reject my proposal? This is rule! What else can you say? Where did you get the gold? Don't you know it? I don't know. - See you. - See you. I just want to be fair and reasonable. You killed wing and then Mr. ch... As well as the commissioner of custom department. What do you want? I always have a dream. I can't waste my life. I want to get the most precious thing in Shanghai. I tell myself, when I am qualified when I am rich, I must marry her! I want to be your son-in-law. Young man, you want to get my most precious thing! I think, if you don't mind, nothing will bother. So confident? Lik. I have an important friend in business. I want you to meet him, to communicate with him. Then, come back and tell me your point of view, this is very important to me, you should understand. I will do as you instructed. This cinema has been bought by me, you can watch movie any time you like. I want to make movies too. To film everything about you. You, me our family... And our children. Don't worry, I've talked to your daddy. He's agreed our marriage. I am sorry. Please give me some time, I'll explain this to you. I'll give you 3 days. Wonderful! Wonderful! I can't imagine keung will take woman home! Even keung falls in love too! Let me take a look at my sister-in-law! I've got youl! Ching-ching? Are you fung ching-ching? Ching-ching, do you like ting lik? In fact, I like another guy. Last summer... Who is it? Be carefull hold me. Miss. Miss. Room inspection. Something happened, it's emergency! Miss, an escaped soldier from kirin ran into this train. They want to check your room. What do they want to see? Miss hates people looking at her in this way. If Mr. fung knows it, we'll be in trouble. If you are impolite to miss you will be complaint certainly. You are bleeding! Blood on my hand too. Luckily they didn't see it. Let's take a look over there! Let's go. Take care of miss, I'm going to take a look. I heard that many Taiwan soldiers escaped from north east. I pity you and your buddies. You will lose much blood! Let me treat your wound first. Wasn't it terrible to be trained in Japanese camps? - Do you want to go south? - Cut the crap What's up? I am tired. There is an escaped soldier! Don't let him go! Freeze. I don't drink. Smoke? I don't know smoking. Come on, you smoked last night. Well, why are they so polite to you? What's the relationship between your dad and the Japanese? I am different from my dad. He has friends all over the world. He makes money in peaceful days. Now, the ne is in a mess, he makes money from the mess too. Many people hate my dad. They hate me too. One day, my dad wasn't home, so I sneaked out. I went to the north by train. But no matter where I go, my father's friends are next to me. I am like an escaped soldier. I was found eventually. At last, I was taken to this train and I was sent back home. Wonderful! You won again! I lost! Later, I sent that guy to hospital. His leg broke, he became a cripple. I am useless, I can't do anything. I can't change anything around me. I can't go out either. I hate myself so much. I really hate myself. Let me show you around. Fine. Will you come to Shanghai to visit me? Shanghai isn't the place I am heading to. I am different. I am homeless. My dad hates men getting close to me. You are the first one to dance with me. May I know your name? Don't ask my name. After the next stop, we are going to say goodbye. Miss, we have to take another train after the next stop. Please get yourself ready. It's impossible for us to see again. I don't want to see you leaving. Close your eyes. So you won't see me leaving you. Ching-ching. What are you thinking? Nothing. Dad, I am going out. Lai-man... How are you, lai-man? Miss, he mistook me as someone, I fainted after a strike. How come? Miss, who are you chasing after? Do you know him? What do you know? Miss. What's happened? It's no big deal, don't worry. Thank you, doctor, let me send you to the door. Ching-ching, I am sorry. In these months I have used your name to write to lik. His letters are so passionate. He has requested to meet you. I thus replied it wouldn't be allowed by Mr. fung. I know it's my fault to do so, but I don't know what to do. Ching-ching, I've got your reply. I feel like standing on the highest mountain of the world. My best friend said I was lossing my mind. I just told him, I tried hard for our future only. Ching-ching, I can't wait. I want to live with you. I will tell mister fung. Ching-ching, will you blame me? What did you say? So, will you be fond of ting lik? Yesterday night... Why did that guy assault you? Did he mistake you as someone he knows? Yes, he said he did. But he asked me where I made the dress. Why did he ask such question? I am puzzled too. When I told him the address of the tailor, he then released me. May I ask... Is this dress made by you? Yes... yes. Where is the woman now? I don't know. - Speak up. - I really don't know I know you've come to Shanghai, that's why I try hard to find you. What's your name? You need not know it. We won't see each other again. Go up. Go. Go in. Jump. Trust me. Close your eyes. - Are you alright? - I am fine let's go. Hui man-keung, aren't you looking for me? You are hui man-keung, aren't you? I've got you at last! Ching-ching? What's her name? Fung ching-ching. Will she marry you? Of course! If only I propose! Lik, before I knew you, we... You can say anything you like. Forget it. Will our relationship... Be hurt by a woman? What a nice speech! If you are married and you discovered that, your wife bathed with me and slept with me, then I tell you not to harm our relationship because of a woman, - is that alright? - What did you say? I didn't know she is the woman you are loving most! Didn't I tell you? I told you everything! But you didn't tell me anything! I have nothing to tell you. I will leave Shanghai once my job is finished. At that time, everything in Shanghai will go to you. I don't want your sacrifice. I can give you anything, but why do you fight for ching-ching with me? Why? Alright, you said you would leave after finishing your job. How about ching-ching? Can I take her along? Fung king-yiu won't let you do it. Alright. I am leaving. But, remember, take good care of ching-ching. Otherwise, I will kill you. Give way. If you take yourself as a soldier, better commit suicide in front of the comrades. Few hundred members of the Taiwan people's league were sent to ne for training by the Japanese, two troops went for a mutiny together. But a hundred of your fellows were unable to escape, why were they killed in Shanghai? Except you! Did you betray your buddies? I didn't betray them. After the mutiny, we moved out of kirin. We planned to go back to Taiwan. God knows! The one who liaised with us died. We lost contact with you. After getting on board, we discovered that our identities were disclosed by betrayers. Why weren't you killed? Since the list of our party was kept by me. The comrades wanted to protect me. What a nice speech! Why did you fight for your fame and wealth in Shanghai instead? I escaped through my buddies' blood. So I swore. I wanted to avenge them. No one will trust what you are talking. Now, I want to execute you right here. The foe I want to find has appeared! If you kill me now, you will never know who betrayed our league! Give me one chance, give me one chance! If you don't kill me now, I can't even escape, give me few more days, so I can take revenge for my buddies by my own hands. Lik, I have a very important friend in business. I want you to see him, to communicate. Then, come back and tell me what you think about him. This is very important to me, you'd understand. Mr. fung, your son-in-law has come. I'll arrange it. I won't miss it. Ting lik works without control. He will ruin the plan of the Japanese troops in Shanghai. But it's not necessary to feel pity. Our plan is going to start. Mr. ting, our boss invites you to go in. His car is here, but he is not around. - We can't find him! - Yes. How is it? We can't find him. Where is he? Brother chun is back. Brother chun... Brother chun, they found miss fung at your home this morning. So they are looking for you. Are you brother chun? Mister and miss fung are waiting for you at home. I'll follow you. My dad looks fierce, but he loves me very much. Long life to the Taiwan people's league... How can you let hui man-keung escape? - What are you still thinking of? - Mr fung - Daddy. - Ching-ching Your real lover is someone else. In fact, I rather feel surprise. Well, ching-ching, introduce your friend to me now. Fine. Uncle, I... He is called hui man-keung. I see, Mr. hui. Nice to meet you, sorry to let you wait. Are you the son-in-law to be of Mr. fung? Now, I am not. But Mr. fung is the one I respect most. He asked me to see you, that's why I come. It doesn't matter, since you come to see me, I'll arrange something specially for you. Sit down please. Do you want to be Mr. fung's son-in-law? He won't let others take away his daughter. Ching-ching's friend is my friend. Mr. hui, where is your hometown? Kwangtung. Some years ago, we moved to Beijing. I haven't eaten mutton in Beijing for years. Mister, I am now going to prepare the midnight snack. Fine. Mr. hui, please take a seat. Uncle leung, just go ahead. Mr. hui, the Japanese has messed up the north. What kind of business can you do then? We businessmen won't care about politics. Mr. hui, what kind of business are you dealing with? My family trade tea. Tea? Well, can people grow tea in the north? I said, my hometown is kwangtung. Mister fung asked me to kill you. I won't let you die comfortably. I will enjoy enough before your death. Daddy, he is just joking. Girls shouldn't interrupt parent's talk. Look at you! I haven't seen you for one day only, your dress is so dirty! Why don't you get changed now? Mr. hui, want a cigar? I will do it myself. - Daddy. - Miss... - I heard gun shot. - You can't go in. What's happened inside? Let me go! Get lost. Don't come close. - Daddy. - Get lost miss... Let me go. Miss! Daddy... Get lost! Why do you want to kill him? I eave me alone. Hands off. No! Stop! Uncle lau, brother lik is upstairs. Why do you come here? Since Mr. fung's death, miss seems to be mad! She has no response to anything. Now, it's all a mess in fung's family. Everyone wants to kill hui man-keung & take over Mr. fung's place. Mr. ting, I hope you to forget the hatred against Mr. fung, for the sake of miss fung, can you come out and do something? Ching ching... Don't worry, for you, I'll fight for what you deserved. Sure I will. From now on, fung's business is my business. All of you should remember... The benefits which Mr. fung granted us. Don't ruin the regulations which are set by Mr. fung. And... Hui man-keung's life is mine. No one can kill him, except me. The list which you want. If you want to kill me, just go ahead. Fung king-yiu is the man behind, we all know it. Now you killed our foe, when will you go back to Taiwan? Don't you think I am valuable to you anymore? Everyone in Shanghai wants to kill you now, you are in danger. Leave with me. Hui man-keung. Hui man-keung. Happy new year! I am going to inform brother lik, keep an eye on him. Brother lik, he is on the way. Ask all buddies to wait for me out there. - Brother lik, we want... - Listen. Tonight, either one will leave this place. No matter who will go out, you should take any action, just pretend nothing has happened. Agree? Yes. Let's go. Happy new year! Listen, brother lik asked us to wait outside. Let's go! Go! - What's the matter? - Yung, what did brother lik say? Brother lik said, he wants us to wait outside. Never go in no matter what's happening inside. No way! This is brother lik's order. They are buddies! Stay calm... New year will come soon. Why do you look for me? Why don't you leave? This is a ticket. If you have chance to leave, try your best to go back to Taiwan. If There is sand of Shanghai's beach under your foot, I think you'll regret to be named hui man-keung. No matter what you tell me, I won't tell you the reason why I killed fung king-yiu. I don't come for an explanation. I just want to see... How you keep your promise. I think you've misunderstood. I won't promise anything to anyone. Stay quiet... Dear friends, the critical moment has arrived. 1936 is coming soon. Time flies. Another year is coming. 7 - be nice to ching-ching. - 6 - Or I will kill you, I swear. Happy new year! Headless bullets! I pay everything I owed you! Brother keung. Don't hold me. Brother keung. I am so happy to hear you greeting me brother keung. Let me walk out alone. Let him go. Don't you think you are great? You want me to kill you. Have you thought of your buddies' feeling? Have you thought of my feeling? I can't imagine that you are so selfish! Let him go. Do you want to be hero? Walk out alone. Yee-Yung, don't let fung's fellows go in. Got you. Let's go, let's go in. Brother keung... Keung! Brother lik, fung's fellows have arrived, they are out there. - What'll we do? - What to do? No matter what, I want him to leave Shanghai safe and alive. Take him away. Be careful. Come on. Hurry up. Mr. ting... Hui man-keung has been killed by me. Let's go back to see uncle la... I want to go in and take a look. Can you hear me? Mr. ting said he killed hui man-keung, don't you trust him? What are you nagging? Don't you think Mr. ting is cheating you? Are you alright? Let's go. Brother keung, hold it. We are taking you to see doctor. From now on I want to share what I have with you in Shanghai. I am only a visitor in Shanghai. I'll certainly leave after doing my job here. Let's wait and see. Maybe you don't want to leave for something unknown.
