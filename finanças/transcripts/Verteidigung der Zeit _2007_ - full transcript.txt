Subtitles by Tag Gallagher and Andy Rector In Defense of Time So, nothing with "Time is Money"... Their only weapon is precisely time. The people who have money, never have time. Because, it's clear, money has to be reinvested quickly. One can't lose time. But if you have time, you're stronger in the long run. Even in a world like the one we've reached now. But one pays for this. This is clear. One pays nevertheless, because... One doesn't pay for this. The nerves and bones are the ones that pay. Filmmakers Danièle Huillet and Jean-Marie Straub were inseparable. October 9, 2006, Danièle died. At the beginning of the 60s, they came to Germany to make The Chronicle of Anna Magdalena Bach. But there was another reason to leave France, which Jean-Marie describes in an interview: ‘I left because I had Algerian friends, and when the first grenade exploded in Algeria, I thought the Algerians were right. And then I had French acquaintances who came back from there with bowed heads and who were silent, and who we heard six months later had had to participate in torture, which they did, or did not. Besides, if I'd not left France, Danièle would have turned her back on me. I had no choice. I left France first from conviction, then because of love. Without Danièle I'd never have made a film. I'm too lazy. I'd have fallen by the wayside, because if you're alone in this kind of system, you cannot resist. And as Leterier says in A Man Escaped, "It's easier in pairs."’ Danièle and Jean-Marie struggled for years until they found enough money for Bach. During that time, their first film, Machorka-Muff, was made. It was incomparable to any other film, and called forth some enemies. But the composer Karl-Heinz Stockhausen wrote: What interested me most in your film is the composition of time, which is - as it is to music - particular to film. To let each element have its own irreplaceable and indispensable moment; no decoration. "Everything is the main thing," said Webern in such cases. Also good is the openness, the continuation of thinking in the heads of the spectators, dispensing with any gesture of overture and finale. Gustav Leonhardt, who plays Bach, together with Straub during the filming of Bach, 1968. Leonhardt was one of the pioneers of historic performance practice. After 1968 Jean-Marie and Danièle moved to Rome. They made one of their principal works, the opera film Moses and Aaron, after Schönberg. Then numerous films with texts by Corneille, Hölderlin, Brecht, Fortini, Pavese, Vittorini, Duras, Cézanne, Gasquet, Kafka, another Schönberg opera. But here we are dealing with the texts by Cesare Pavese and what the two filmmakers made from this literary material in Tuscany. 1978, From the Cloud to the Resistance. And 2005, Those Encounters of Theirs. Both films contain parts of Pavese's Dialogues with Leucò. In this, Pavese's last great work, written in the postwar years 1945-47, Pavese reverts to characters from Greek myths, usually demigods, occasionally humans, speaking in dialogues about nature, the immortals, and mortal human beings. 27 conversations. There one can find everything that can be said about mankind. Pavese on myth: Myth is what happens countless times in our sublunar world, yet is unique, outside time - like a recurrent ceremony that unrolls each time as though for the first time, in a time that's the ceremony's own time, atemporal, mythic. Before myth became fable, some fabulous event, it was a simple norm, meaningful behavior, a rite that sanctified reality. And it was also the impulse, the magnetic charge, that alone could induce people to carry out work. No child is conscious of living in a mythic world. Indeed, no child knows anything about that “childhood paradise" which, as an adult, he'll realise he used to live in. The reason is that in his mythic years the child has better things to do than to give a name to his state. He has to live in this state and know the world. And, children learn to know the world not - as one might think - with immediate and original contact with things, but through signs of them: words, illustrations, stories. Pictures by Otto Pankok. He was banned from painting in 1936. Cesare Pavese was forced into exile in Calabria by the Fascists in 1935. In 1945 Pavese became a member of the Communist Party. Straubs says Pavese killed himself in a hotel room in Turin at the age of 40. Because he couldn't bear that a party he believed in, the Communist Party of Italy, didn't accept the weight of the past, but rushed forward toward progress and development. In 1978 the first Pavese film, Dalla nube alla resistenza (From the cloud to the resistance) Nefele, the Cloud (Olimpia Carlisi) in conversation with Ixion (Guido Lombardi). You won't come anymore on the mountain? You're afraid of me? I'll come on the mountain and everywhere. You can't do anything to me, Ixion. You can't do anything against the water and wind. You must bow your head. Only thus will you save your fate. You're afraid, Nefele. I am afraid I've seen the tops of mountains. But not for me, Ixion. I cannot suffer. I'm afraid for you who're nothing but humans. These mountains, where once you ran around as masters, these creatures of ours and yours, begotten in freedom, now tremble at a nod. We're all enslaved to a stronger hand. The sons of the water and wind, the Centaurs, hide at the bottom of ravines. They know they are monsters. Who says so? Don't defy the hand, Ixion. It's fate. I've seen some more audacious than they or you jump from the rock and not die. Understand me, Ixion. Death, which was your courage, can be taken from you like any possession. Do you know this? You've told me before. What's it matter? We'll live more. You joke and don't know the immortals. I'd like to know them, Nefele. Ixion, you think they're presences like us, like Night, Earth and old Pan. You're young, Ixion, but you were born under the old destiny. For you, monsters don't exist, just companions. Oedipus (Walter Pardini) and the blind priest Tiresias' (Ennio Lauricella) dialog. But then, the gods, what do they do? The world is older than they are. Already it filled space and bled, it felt pleasure it was the only god - when time hadn't been born yet. Things themselves reigned then. What happened was things. Whereas now, by means of the gods, everything is made into words, illusion, threat. But the gods can only make trouble, bring things together or pull them apart. Not touch them, not touch them. They came too late. How can you, a priest, say this? If I didn't know at least this, I wouldn't be a priest. Take a boy who goes swimming in the Asopos. It's a summer morning. The boy comes out of the water, goes back in happy, dives and dives again. He takes ill and drowns. What do the gods have to do with it? Should he attribute his end to the gods or to the pleasure he enjoyed? Neither one nor the other. Something happened that's neither good nor bad, something that hasn't a name — then they'll give it a name, the gods. In the film's Part Two: "The Bastard" (Mauro Monni) and young Cinto (Mario di Mattia) I was a boy like you and lived here with Padrino. We had a goat, I took it to graze. In winter, when the hunters stopped coming, it was brutal, we couldn't even get to the bani, so much water and muddy ice was there, and down from Gaminella came the wolves, who in the woods didn't find anything to eat. In the morning we'd see their tracks in the snow. Like dog tracks, but deeper. I slept in the room in back with the girls and we'd hear at night the wolf howling from cold on the bank. On the bank last year there was a dead man. A German, buried by the partisans. So close to the road? No, it came from up there, on the bank. The water'd carried him down and Pa found him under the mud and stones. The films we make are... how do you say it? I think the problem with our films isn't that they're intellectual, it's that they're too simple. Yes, that's it. They're... what's the word? ...sensuelle? sensual They're sensual, simply. They're sensual. They tell a story, there are characters, but they're sensual at every second. Meaning, look at this, the light, the movement, listen to this and so on. This is something - I've said this before - that doesn't happen a second time. After From the Clouds to the Resistance, they returned 26 years later, through Hölderlin, to Pavese. From the last five Dialogues with Leucò came Those Encounters of Theirs (Quei loro incontri). again shot in Tuscany in the small town of Buti. As previously, they first staged a theater play with the text. The performers were farmers, craftsmen, a mayor, the town's theater manager - a spectrum. Jointly the texts were read and rehearsed for one month. Afterwards the actors lived with their texts for an entire year. They met evenings and weekends to read the dialogues. The next year, again three months of rehearsals. The theater script of the filmmakers. After Easter 2005, four performances were held in Buti. After that, the performers had ten days of rest until the first day of shooting. The film team had known each other a long time. On the right, cameraman Renato Berta, Jean-Pierre Duret, sound engineer. Listening to the recording just filmed. The speaking, the rhythm, the breathing, the effort, the wind, the insects, a bird flutters up - the richness of direct sound. The sounds one hears, and the people who produce these sounds, are inseparable. This is exactly the opposite of what the great Ingmar has allowed himself with his Magic Flute, in Swedish to boot. Renoir has repeatedly said, "I am cowardly. I don't believe in anything, not in religion, but I believe in this." He did this with an ashtray. And he said, "Look, this is le directe [direct sound]." This sound is what happened and what one has seen, and what one has heard. It is inseparable. And this has to do with our films, that's why... I believe in the sentence: Don't expect the form to be there before the idea, together they make their appearance. If something has not found a form, so long as something has not yet found a form, then this something does not exist. It cannot exist. This is an old story. Good old Thomas Aquinas said in the Middle Ages that the soul is just the form of the body. There is no soul that exists like a butterfly. But also a butterfly is something concrete, it has a form. To live means to defend a form. If one can't do this anymore, then one doesn't live anymore. This is especially true for the characters and gestures, and as well for a syllable. One has to achieve a structure, a form; otherwise there's nothing, that means, no idea, there is nothing. Danièle’s Huillet's copy of their film script, with her notes and annotations. With the performers just before recording. It's like in music. If you're on a high note, you have to stay there. Yes, but how do those two enter the screen? A bit more to the left? - Yes... Wait, let me look, don't move. The position is good now, I mean, as soon as they enter it. - Didn't I show you it? - You did, I saw her... And with him, there is no problem. Yes, if you widen this enough, he comes into it. - Show it to me. - It's roughly... I'm not sure... But it's fine! Pedro Costa made a film about the work of the two at the editing table. Danièle Huillet's work in particular. Alongside, a short film evolved, Six Bagatelles. Here's an excerpt: Luxury is something one should never, ever give up... for any reason at all, including progress and revolution, etc. They shut us up in a dark universe and what we want to say is just: "something else, was, is, could be, will be..." That was what I called the "communist utopia" of Empedocles. The last third, at the beginning of the last third, the guy says, "Don't forget this and this and that, if we don't have this and this, then nothing will become of it all.” That's exactly what all attempts at socialism have been so far. They tell the people: "We have to make sacrifices, give up this, give up that.” And now it's even worse. "To be happy, go without drinking water, go without fresh air, go without having time, go without having quiet, and you'll live in the best of possible worlds: it's not a miracle. despite Chernobyl and all the rest, it's still better than it ever could be or ever was." That's the supreme lie! It was against this that Benjamin revolted when he said to his socialist and communist friends: "The revolution is not the forward flight toward progress, it's the tiger jump ...to the past. That's how it is... Melchior! And our luxury... is that we have nothing to lose. I'm not in this for the career, never have been, even at my age, even if I have tried to make a career out of it, I don't do that anymore, so I can allow myself the luxury of doing things no one else would do. It's like the story Buñuel tells in his autobiography, about the day his son convinced him, after some time, to dine with Nicholas Ray. And Buñuel said, "The most terrible thing I have ever heard about our work was what Ray told me after I don't know how many hours at dinner: "'Where I come from, when you make a film that costs so and so many millions, your next film has to cost at least three million more, never any less, and it's even better if it costs twice as much as the film before because that's how career works.'" And we, obviously, do the opposite, always have. We do a big production like Moses and Aaron, and before History Lessons which we made for 65,000 marks. - And then Fortini/Cani - ...in 16mm. Yes, after Moses and Aaron we made a film in 16mm, about a guy called Fortini. So, that indeed is luxury! And then we allowed ourselves the luxury of making a seven-minute film before the Kafka on which we shot 11 weeks and used 77,000 meters of film - 35mm, black and white. - Thierry says isn't that terrible? That means that freedom is a luxury. Yes, in today's world it really is. THIERRY: Isn't that what The Tall Lombard says in Sicilia? that to invent a little freedom, a bit of luxury, he'd give up things... No? He says he'd give up all he owns... Even more! There's an old kulak who said, "I'd give my land, my horse, everything to..." to be part of the human community. With these last fine words, we have to go. - And your wash? - It stays hanging. Any woman who washes clothes leaves them hanging. If it rains, they'll dry again. Come on. We're not going to spend our life hanging clothes, taking them down, hanging them up. Come on, Melchior. I'm sure the clothes are dry. Aren't they dry? Jean-Marie Straub is working on a new film he'd planned with Danièle Huillet. First theater, then film.
