[music playing] [kronnan screeching] [music playing] [rumbling] [seismograph whirring] It's the third time today. Where's the epicenter? 120 miles northwest of the fault. The seismograph must be malfunctioning. No, it was serviced last week. Just keep an eye on it for me, Charlie. And call me if it gets worse. Where are you going? I've got something I gotta take care of. [music playing] Sorry I'm late. JAKE: Shouldn't you plugthat thing in or something? Hybrids are the wave of the future, Jake. Yeah, well, if we believeeverything that you read, we'd all be living on themoon and driving flying suitcases by now, wouldn't we? It's all marketing, little brother. You and dad have been sellingme that one since the birth. Yeah, well, you know,since I am the only one still on this side of reality, Ifigure I owe it to the old man to keep you grounded. [machines beeping] Look bro, it seems like the oldfamily BBQ thing is a little stressful on you, so if youwant to just take a rain check this month, it's not a problem. We promised mom and dad we'd do this. I'm not going to let them down. That is a lovely sentiment. However, I don't reallythink that they can see us, so you know, you can chill. We do Chinese takeout. I got some pizza pocketsin the fridge right there. Chill. Yeah, that's always been easy for you. Since you showed up to Tate,you've become a friggin legend. Even in failure, you're a success. Yeah, well, you're the one with the big house and the weird car. All I've got is my fat boy out there a couple of sober memorieswith Monica and my six-pack. My three-pack right here. About to be a two-pack right here. She resigned last month. [music playing] Said it was med leave. But I don't think-- [vocalizing negatively] Let's not bring up the past. I want to do something on my own, you know? Something memorable. You'll get there. I'm all show. I wish Mom and Dad could see you. Little GQ scientist. They'd be really proud of you. - You really think so? - I know so. Now let me borrow 20 bucks. How about 40 bucks? You jackass. You're dead. Respect your elders, son. [interposing voices] Headlock. [grunting] [machines beeping] What the hell? [music playing] [ships firing] My god, they're headed right for us. Call it. It's the real deal. Black 10, black 10, wehave a security breach at S4. This is not a drill. Escort priority one. Escort priority one. SOLDIER: Move out. Move out. SOLDIER: Move out! Move out. SOLDIER: Lock and load. Let's move. Let's move. [radio chatter] [phone ringing] OK. I'm getting old. 888 from the ranch. - Pizza pockets for me. - Gotta go. Look up on your way. All right. It's probably a big bucket of nothing. [ship crashing] [systems beeping] [music playing] [weapon firing] COSTA: Are you seeing what I'm seeing? [guns firing] [electricity crackling] [music playing] [helicopter exploding] CHARLIE [ON RADIO]: Costa. Sir, target is hostile. Target is hostile. [weapon firing] [rocket exploding] Where the hell is Alex? [siren wailing] SOLDIER: Go, go, go. Go, go, go. SOLDIER: Ready, Captain. SOLDIER: Ready, Captain. SOLDIER: Ready. SOLDIER: Ready, Captain. SOLDIER: Ready, Captain. SOLDIER: Ready, Captain. SOLDIER: Read, Captain. Halt, or you will be fired upon. SOLDIER: Hold you positions. This is your final warning. Fire! [guns firing] Medic! [guns firing] This is Alpha One. We have sustained major casualties and need immediate backup for my location. [music playing] SOLDIER: Let's go, let's go. [radio chatter] ALEX: Charlie. We had two unidentifiedscrash land nearby. One target is hostile. They took out the chopper. Now hangar S4 is underattack and the medivac units are already enroute. All right, calm down. Call Tate, get Maj 12 down here now. Do it! Saddle up. Let's go. [music playing] [inhaling deeply] Where's my medivac? My men are dying. I need backup. Where is my medivac? I need help now. [kronnan screeching] [music playing] SOLDIER: What happened here? [music playing] [kronnan screeching] Hands in the air! Put your hands in the air now! [device beeping] Fall back. Everyone out, now! [device exploding] [man screaming] [microwave beeping] REPORTER [ON TV]: Welcomeeveryone to Eyewitness News. The most trusted news in the region. The source for all of yournews and entertainment. There are reports of a disturbance in the wildlife refuge. We take you live now to ourcorrespondent standing by. REPORTER [ON TV]: Sourcesfrom the Department of Natural Resources say the explosion within the Millerton Wildlife Refuge is nothing to worry about. Plumes of black smoke can be seen as far as Jefferson County. So far, park rangers are not saying what caused the explosion,but they are admitting there may be a few fatalities. Alex. [music playing] What do you mean he's not available? This is Jake Townsend, his brother. Then let me talk to Charlie Weise. No, you can't take a message. What the hell is going on there? Hello? Fine. Have it your way then. [crowd clamoring] REPORTER: The public has aright to this information. RANGER: Come on, guys. There are children around here. Come on, you've got to give us something. [music playing] [camera shutter snapping] Hands where I can see them. - Jake. - Hey, Charlie. I see you got my message.- You shouldn't be here. Where's Alex? I can't answer that. Look, Charlie, I don'treally care about the operation anymore. I just want to know where my brother is, OK? I got a bad feeling about this. You know I can't discloseclassified information to a civilian. Well then, let's pretendI'm still on the inside. I can't do it. I'm not going anywhere untilsomebody gives me some answers. Jake, don't put me in the position. Cuff him. Put him in the Jeep. [music playing] You can't haul me down here without processing me with an attorney present. Shut up, Townsend. You have no rights here. Not anymore. I got it. Nice acting job, Brando. Two unidentifieds crashedin a park this morning. One confirmed hostile target, then all hell broke loose at a hangar S4. S4? Yeah. Sorry, about the cuffs. Alex took a team to S4 andhasn't reported back in yet. This is big, Jake. The pros are here. Tate. It'll all be covered up by dawn. Right, right, right, right. Gotta go. For your brother. [music playing] Target one appears to be heading west, towards the town of mercury. Satellites lost the second target. Assemble a unit to intercept target one. We'll pick them off one at a time. I want them both in a box by sundown. Yes, sir. All right, men, let's move it out. Mercury. Chop, chop. Hello, Mr. Townsend. Where's my brother? How's that uniform feel? Familiar, yet out of reach? You're not only trespassing, butimpersonating a federal office. Look, all I want to know is where's Alex. The official story? He's on extended vacation. Fly fishing, I think it was. Come on Tate, enough withthe Area 51 cover up crap. I think you've overheardtoo much as it is. Take this man holding. Have him sedated. The suits will want to debrief him. This isn't the end of it man. Sure it is, Jake. [music playing] Pull it over, buddy. [gun firing] [radiator hissing] Oh yeah. Oh, thank you PlayStation. - Jake Townsend's escaped.- What? He stole one of our Jeeps. He's about to cross the perimeter. Then go find his ass, you pack of geniuses. Let's roll. [kronnan screeching] [music playing] [weapon firing] [electricity crackling] ALIEN: Get out of the vehicle. Put the weapon down. What do you want? [gun firing] [air hissing] I need your help. You speak English. I speak many languages. It is part of my training. Looks like you got a pretty bad injury. It is not important. I need your help withsomething greater than I. Why me? It seems that you're also in jeopardy. Perhaps we could help each other. With what? I must find the omega seed. A large obelisk. What do you need that for? At sundown tomorrow, it will destroy the inhabitants of this planet unless it is deactivated with this. [music playing] The ether rod. You-- you were at S4? Did you kill those guys? No. There is another. Another-- another what? Another-- My navigation system wasdestroyed by an omega centurion named Kronnan whose sole mission is to see that the omega seed detonates. Will you help me? I think I know somebody that can help us. Get in. [music playing] [helicopter rotors whirring] [radio chatter] I heard rumors of the omega seed, but it was classified, even for me. Look, she might be able to help us out, but it could take some time. Time is something we have little of. JAKE: Come on. [knocking at door] - I don't believe it. - Hey, Monica. My mother you'd you comecrawling back eventually. But you should have brought flowers. I brought him. Oh my god. We need your help. Come in. You're hurt. It is nothing. Let us help you. Come on. Men. I require an H. 4OH. Jake, hand me the ammonia. In the cabinet. Top shelf. The omega seed is like a thermometer. It monitors the developmentof a planet until it is ripe. Ripe for what? Harvesting. [music playing] The omega race relies onartificial waste products from civilized planets, fossil fuel emissions, nuclear waste and the like. Why don't they just ask for them? We'll be happy to be rid of it. They do not negotiate. They conquer. That is enough. So, what? The obvious sends out a signalwhen the planet's ready, and then they invade? They obelisk will send off a signal, but it will also detonate, releasing a pathogen into the atmosphere. Pathogen? Anything that breatheswill be dead in 36 hours. How do we stop it? The ether rod. The omega race designed them. It's a safety switch toprevent a premature detonation. We managed to obtain several of them. However, this one fellinto the hands of your race 60 years ago. The crashes of '47. [music playing] As your planet was recentlytargeted by the omega race, I was sent to retrieve the ether rod and deactivate the omega seed. But it was not untilrecently, when the seed began to activate, that I was able to determine the rod's true location. What about all the interest in Area 51? Well, the-- the governmentobviously leaked stories towards New Mexico to keepthe enthusiasts way from the real deal here in Missouri. Why didn't you just use the ether rod? Because each omega seedhas a specific ether rod. A key to it deadly lock. This is the only one that can stop it. But without my navigationsystem, I am blind. I've heard about a mythicalien structure, discovered underground in the 30s. The story goes the governmentcovered up, classifying it. But I have no idea where it is. The location of the seed is coded on to the ether rod itself. So you can speak English,and you can fly a spaceship, but you can't translate the ether rod? My hard drive has been disabled. You might want tothink about night school. Look, I brought him herebecause I thought you might help us decode the glyphs. So-- so now I'm your go-to girl? You wouldn't let me study it before it was put into classified storage. Then you vanish, and I was stuckin a file room for two years. No calls. No emails. I was discharged. What? I signed a release for you tohave the ether rod for study. And Tate got a hold of it and freaked. If I'd have talked to you about it, we'd both been court-martialed. It was part of the agreement that you and I never speak again. You protected me. Jake, I'm-- I'm sorry. There's nothing to be sorry for. You have access to the ether rod now. Can you decipher it? Maybe. It's going to take some time. You must hurry. [music playing] Alex is missing. What? Zero contact. I'm sure he's just gone deep. You used to vanish too, remember? I don't know this time. He'll turn up. Time is running short. I've almost got it. We've got another 18 hours. Kronnan must have the location locked by now. He is coming. Not helping. Just let her work, OK? So, you got a name, or-- Jude. I'm Jake. [music playing] So where are you from? Far away. You have family there? I had a mate. Had? Killed by Kronnan. [music playing] [woman shouting] What was her name? Quintana. I'm sorry. I lost my parents. I am sorry. I found it. It's in Potosi. [music playing] SOLDIER: Go, go, go, go. Let's go. Let's go. Hands where I can see them. No. Nobody gets hurt. Your weapon, sir. Your weapon. Jake, you're becoming quite a thorn. Don't you know this thing is dangerous? He's here to help, Tate. Oh, please. Humvee's ready when you are, Sir. Roger that. We'll debrief there. But I want our visitor here shackled now. You remember these bad boys? Unbreakable, my friend. What about the others. I'll take that. Monica. I told you she couldn't be controlled. Screw you, Tate. I know the truth. Wow. She's got a bigger mouth and yours, Jake. I know you're here to contain alien activity. Just how many of thesevisitors have you exterminated? This thing look like a Girl Scout to you? We're cleaners, Monica. Mister and Misses Mustardstaying out on the prairie can't handle the truth. Hell, they should thank me every day for keeping them safe in theirlittle towns and mediocre life. So just shut your damn mouth, all right? All right, let's move it out. Tate, I know how much youlike to cover things up, but you have no idea howpublic this is going to be. We're talking global disaster here. Yeah? Well, good luck with that, Mr. Conspiracy. Does he look like a conspiracy to you? Who, ET? Trust me, he's going on a long vacation. You can't shove the factsunder the flag forever, Tate. It's my job to interpretthe facts, Jake, not yours. Oh, really? Then what about Alex? Huh? Where were the facts wheneverAlex disappeared, huh? You want to know what happened to Alex? Yeah, I do. I'll tell you, Jake. He's dead. Evaporated in that hangaralong with everyone else, thanks to this thing. [music playing] Did you them men in that hangar? Did you kill my brother? Answer me! That's enough, Jake. That's enough. Kronnan. You need to leave. Now. When did you-- Take it down! [guns firing] [kronnan screeching] What the hell is that thing? My problem. You have the ether rod? Yes. Make sure he does not get it. What about you? Let's go. Come on. Not so fast, honey. God, I hate fighting women. MONICA: You OK? - Yeah. You OK? Yeah. Jake. It's missing a gem. Yeah, well, maybe you shouldn't have used an alias space rod as a nine iron. Oh, sarcasm. Now I remember why we broke up. [weapons firing] [music playing] [knuckles cracking] Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. It's missing a gem. It will not function without all six gems. Are you sure? - Yes. - Get in. Come on, come on. Come on. [guns firing] I must have missed hot wiring 101. Let's go back to my house. No, no, we can jack one of the Humvees. [electricity crackling] [engine starting] Sweet. [music playing] [guns firing] [rumbling] Left a trail for us tosee, Little Red Riding Hood. And I-- I'm the big bad wolf. The omega seed is located in Potosi. 50 miles to the south. What about this missing stone? The ether rod is uselesswithout all six gems. We must hurry. Kronnan will attempt to stop us. What is he? Part of him is what yourtechnology has only just begun to explore, quantum physics. Nano machines, only refined. Far beyond your capabilities. But there is the other side. The side that most species Ihave seen share, even yours. What's that? Biology. Protected by a sentient exoskeleton. Then he could be killed? I've seen all those weapons that you got. You don't have something that can take him out? This explosive device canlevel an entire building, yet it is useless against his armor. Only the absence of his armorwill open him to mortality. My hydrochloric acid sphere affected him, but it is not permanent. His technology is simply too strong. So that's it. We just got to find the right can opener. We have got to find the stone. [music playing] [kronnan screeching] It's a classified location in Potosi. I'm sending you the coordinates now. I want my team assembled the moment I get there. The missing gem is close. Turn down that road. [music playing] Great, a junkyard. So what? We're just going to wave the magic stick around until we hit paydirt? Have some faith, Monica. Right. We must hurry. Nice hang. Keep an eye out. There's a couple of rabidrottweilers around this place. [dog barking] Yeah, nice guard dog. Holy crap sticks. Diamond Joe? Who's asking? I'm Jake Townsend. We're from the base. Yeah, well, he's not from the base. JAKE: No. No, he's not. He's not. But he's here to help us. Help us with what? Halloween? I don't need no help. Didn't put up a sign or nothing. Isn't that right, Sparky? [sparky barking] Look, Joe, have you ever heard of something called the omega seed? Omega? Omega. Omega vitamins, maybe. Yeah. You know, my wife, Ethel,made me take them before she kicked five years ago. Maybe she was the one thatneeded to take the vitamins. You know, she wouldn't nagme day in and day out-- This is pointless JOE: --about taking thegreen ones and blue ones. Yeah, look, Joe, we're alittle tight on time here. But we're looking for themissing piece of a puzzle that could be lethal. It's just a small gemstone,about the size of a nickel. And? And our friend is here to help. We were just hoping thatyou could help us locate it. How you know he's not lying? His kind killed peopleback in the crashes of '47. That was the omega race, not us. Well, you learned how to talk. You ran off one of theirships before we shot you down. We were protecting you. The casualties were regrettable. You call strafing the barracks friendly fire? We have a few hours left. How do I know we can trust you? Look, Joe, Joe, he's here to help us. Look, the aliens that he shot down are back, and we've got to stop them. Please. All right. Come on. Captain Kirk stays outside. His kind shot down over a dozen planes. Killed a lot of pilots. Are you sure it was his species? Yes, dammit. Never question a man who owns a junkyard. I'm in touch with thepast like a 1-800 psychic. Look, let's assume for the moment that he's telling the truth. That the casualties were accidental. We've seen Kronnan. The other one has killed dozens of people. Jude has done nothing but help us. You have no idea what he's capable of. Believe me, I have seen itfirsthand when I was a boy. But that's why I spent my life on that base doing my father's work. See? It's missing a gem. Damn right it is. So you know where it is? Look, you don't want tobring those gems together. The thing lights up like a Christmas tree. It emanates some kind of radiation. We decided to remove one of the gems so we could figure out what it was. Then I took it with me when Iretired as a safety measure. So you have it with you? No. I pawned it off to buy this place. You what? Joe, the ether rod candeactivate the omega seed, but it's no good without all six gems. Well, maybe your friend outside there is going to use it as a triggering device to blow us all to smithereens. Have you ever thought about that? How do you know you can trust this guy? Have you had him over to yourhouse for Thanksgiving dinner? [sparky barking] [distant crashing] [music playing] Did you find the gem? It ain't here. [glass shattering] [cars smashing] Kronnan. You have any weapons? You kidding? I may be smart, but I'm still a redneck. [music playing] I think we're going to need something with a little more kick. Think this'll do? I told you. [gun firing] Wait! No! No, no, no, no. Guys. Guys! [kronnan screeching] [guns firing] Get out of here. Go. What about you? Just go. [kronnan screeching] Uh oh. No! [electricity crackling] You killed him. [kronnan screeching] Get in the vehicle. No. Get in the vehicle. We have to go, now. Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! [music playing] [rocket firing] [explosion] [music playing] Whoa. Joe. Get up. He tried to kill me. He took the gem. I told you about him. Now he's got your girl. You've got to stop him fromdetonating the omega seed. How? I don't care how you do it,but at least get your girl back before the big kaboom. [electricity crackling] You better ammo up inside. Put the saw away if you understand me. [kronnan vocalizing] Put it away! You might be tough, but one of these in the face is going to do some damage. So you're going to listento me, you understand? Good. So you here to protect us? Stop the omega seed? How can I trust you? KRONNAN: I am a centurion. I have pledged my life to protect this planet and the omega seed. The other, he is a rogue, a terrorist. The rod he carries is the switchthat will detonate the seed and destroy us all. What about those men and women you killed. KRONNAN: It was they who attacked me. Do you not have war on this planet? Are the rules not the same? [music playing] I want heavy artillery ready within the hour. Make sure everyone's locked and loaded with explosive-tipped, armor-piercing rounds. That will slow his ass down. Yes, sir. We're ready. Establish a black out as well. I don't want to see any othermilitary bases here but ours. Am I clear? - Yes, sir. Move your ass, soldier. [music playing] Sir. Jake. [music playing] Open fire! [guns firing] [horn honking] Jake is with Kronnan. They're gonna stop you. No. Please. Please, please, please. Take it. You never told us the exact location, correct? No. Take the ether rod and go there. I do not know where the omega seed is. Kronnan does. It was his species that created it, not mine. Then why is Kronnan chasing us? To get the ether rodto prevent the shut down. Take it. To deactivate the omega seed,you must slide the ether rod into the terminating port. I beg you, go and do it immediately. How do I know it won't detonate? If you do not trust me, wait until Kronnan reaches the omega seed. Then you will know the truth. Please, go. Time is running out. I will delay Kronnan long enough for you to do what is necessary. Please. [kronnan screeching] [music playing] [kronnan screeching] What are you doing? [kronnan screeching] Go! She's at the path. Hurry! [rod chiming] [music playing] Jude? Jude? [music playing] Ow. Jake. You OK? I'm fine. Jude saved my life. I can't believe I trusted Kronnan. We have a job to do. How much further? Just over the ridge. What are we doing when we get there? Jude said we have to connectthis to the terminating port. Whatever that means. One port is the off switch,the other detonates us all. Great. [music playing] [kronnan screeching] ALIEN: [non-english speech] [music playing] That's it? I dunno. A little anticlimactic. [rooster crowing] [music playing] [kronnan screeching] [rod chiming] There it is. Oh my god. [music playing] JAKE: Give me a hand here. Going down? Going down. Be careful. Jake! [music playing] Whoa. [music playing] Hey, it's OK. It's some sort of air duct or something. I think it's safe. That's what you said whenwe went hang gliding in Cabo. [monica screaming] Stop it. [kronnan screeching] [rod chiming] [music playing] The omega seed. It's supposed to reach all theway down in the Earth's core. From the looks of it, we don't have much time. Let's go. This way. Could I see it for a moment? Start looking for the terminating port. What does it look like? No idea. Oh, well then, thisshould be a piece of cake. Wait a second. The symbols. Did you find a match? Maybe. [music playing] [ground rumbling] [rod booming] [music playing] [kronnan screeching] [music playing] We need the rod. Where is it? [kronnan screeching] MONICA: The ether rod! Kronnan! [music playing] Kronnan. [kronnan screeching] Jake! Jude! No! This is the one. Stop the seed. [electricity crackling] [device beeping] Help. Help. We did it. Come on. Come on. Come on. Wait. [kronnan screeching] [music playing] Thank you. Come on. [music playing] Come on. Come on. Wait, over here. Over here. Hurry. Come on. Come on. You head. Your head. [device exploding] [music playing] I'm sorry about Alex. Thanks. He'd be so-- so proud of you. - You think so? Oh, I know so. I'm proud of you too. Yeah? Well, you didn't do so bad yourself. Did you really throw awayyou're whole career for me? Would it have mattered if I didn't? No. [music playing]
