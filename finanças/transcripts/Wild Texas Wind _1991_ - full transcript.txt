[Thiloa narrating] Well, I am not Joan of Arc or Cleopatra. My name is Thiola Rayfield and I'm just a singer with a Texas band, and I think my story's worth telling. I believe it might be important to someone else tryin' to make sense out of life and the places fate sometimes leads us -- or the places we may be leading ourselves. [CROWD CHANTING] T! T! T! T! T! T! T! T! James! You guys better hurry up! It's been like that for the last 45 minutes back there. Yeah, I'm sorry we're late, the bus blew a tire. Where's T? Changing it. T, it's now or never! I'm ready! Well, I think I am. How do I look? You look like a Texas star. Oooh! Well, let's go give 'em what they paid for! -Alright. [SONG: "Big T"] Cut my teeth on a cactus stalk, In cowboy boots, I learned to walk, said my first words with a Texas drawl in Texas. Big T. Born and raised on the Texas plain, in a Texas church I's born again, I swell with pride when I speak the name of Texas. Big T! Big T! Yippie-i-ki-ay Yippie-i-ki-oh Yippie-i-ki-ee Big T! Big T! Yippie-i-ki-ay Yippie-i-ki-oh Yippie-i-ki-ee Big T! Got the best and got the most, the best cowboys and rodeos, the prettiest girls and livestock shows in Texas. Big T. Bluest skies you've ever seen, home of Bob Wills' western swing, the biggest fans and greatest teams in Texas. Big T! Big T! Yippie-i-ki-ay Yippie-i-ki-oh Yippie-i-ki-ee Big T! Big T! Yippie-i-ki-ay Yippie-i-ki-oh Yippie-i-ki-ee Big T! Native of the Lonestar state, greatest place God ever made. I love you more than I can say, sweet Texas. Might boast too much and talk too loud, can't deny the fact I'm proud. You have placed your brand on me, Big T. Big T! Big T! Yippie-i-ki-ay Yippie-i-ki-oh Yippie-i-ki-ee Big T! Big T! Yippie-i-ki-ay Yippie-i-ki-oh Yippie-i-ki-ee Big T! Yeah! Thank you! [Bus sputters, creaks, knocks] Oh, yeah! What is it now? Get your camera, let's take some more pictures. [Band chattering] Thiola: Well, we certainly could use the time off, I know I could use a rest! Ben: Don't get too comfortable, T. Old man Richland's check bounced. I called up the club, the phone's been disconnected, I called up that bartender you were so friendly with, he said the place has been padlocked by the IRS. How much was it for? Sixteen hundred dollars. Does this mean we're going right back to work? It's either that or get honest work. Well, did you tell the others? Yeah, yeah, I told everybody. Remember that feed warehouse out by the airforce base, you said looked like somebody was reopening it? Yeah. Remember a man named Justice Parker from outta Lubbock? He had a club up in Waco we worked. Yeah, I remember him. Well, it looks like he bought it, renovated it, and turned it into a cowboy dreamland and he wants us for his opening night - tonight! Tonight? Tonight! [Sirens, country music] Whoa, Billy! How are you? Come on! -Justice! Pull on in here! How you doin'? Don't hit anybody. I knew you'd be here, I knew you'd be here. Where's your dad? Oh, he's comin' over later. He said a judge was gonna meet him here. The judge is in the back at the craps table. Go back and say hi. Well, see ya inside, buddy. Yeah, good to see ya! Yeah, good to see you! [Indistinct chatter] Justice: I want you to meet my father. Now, you may not remember this but he booked your band at a club he had before he retired. Ben: So you run all the clubs by yourself now? Justice: Yeah, he pretty much just sits around and talks to himself. Come on. Excuse us. Dad? You remember Ben Rayson from The Texas Wheel? Oh, you bet! You guys are tighter than a hat band! Glad you could make it over tonight. Thank you. You know, you got quite a setup here! Well, Justice doesn't have his liquor license yet but we thought we'd kick it off with a little private party. The rest of your band here yet? What about that little girl singer? Well, she'll be here in a little bit and the guys are starting to trickle in about now. Listen, you guys have a good time. Can't wait to hear you! Let me introduce you to a state-of-the-art sound system. I'll see ya, dad. Let's shoot some craps! [Car honks] Pull back and move the car. Don't let him park there! [horn honks] Wait a minute, buddy, just back it up! Let me give you a hand. Thank you. You're welcome. Nice car. Here ya go. You made it. Welcome to dance across Tex -- oh! Thank you. I'm Justice Parker. Thiola Rayfield. My friends call me Big T for short. I remember this band when they were just The Texas Wheel. Well, we want to thank you for this opportunity. Lord knows, we need the money. Well, Ben told me. It's tough luck about your bus. It turned out to be my good fortune. It's nice to see you again. Again? Oh, I remember you. I remember some girl named Tiffany being draped around your neck all evening. Oh, I don't know. You know, Tiffany's gone on to other things. Oh, yeah? You live with the band, or what? Eh, somethin' like that. Yeah? Hey, I need to get on in there, I'm runnin' a little behind. I gotta get dressed for the... Ooh! Ah! Sorry. I don't wanna be holding you up. Oh, you shouldn't cuz I understand the boss here really gets testy if the band don't start on time. We shouldn't even be seen together! Go on! Nice to see you. Yeah, you too. [SONG: "There's a Ring Around the Moon Tonight"] There's a ring around the moon tonight. There's a ring around the moon tonight! There's a ring around the moon, meaning romance is in bloom. There's a ring around the moon tonight. My mama used to tell me long ago, when the moon was big and full and all aglow, and encircled by a ring, it meant that love was on the wing, and the stars are in my eyes, so hold me close. There's a ring around the moon tonight. There's a ring around the moon tonight! There's a ring around the moon, meaning romance is in bloom. There's a ring around the moon tonight! Sailin' about on a silver cloud, my heart jumps over the moon. Hey diddle-diddle, the Texas fiddle playing our love tune! Oh, there's a ring around the moon tonight. There's a ring around the moon tonight! There's a ring around the moon, means my love is comin' soon. There's a ring around the moon tonight! Thank you! Oh, you're so nice. Thank you! Yeah! Thank you! Thanks to the band! You guys were lot better than the last time I heard ya! I wanna know something? Could it be her? She is great but I'll tell ya, all that road work really puts us in shape, I'm tellin' you. Ben, have you met Marvin Kloner? He and his daughter Cheryl are the ones who do those music spots that we talked about on the Texas public radio. Oh yeah, Marvin, how you doin'? Oh, good! Hey, great show, as usual. Listen, ya'all need a new record label, right? You know what? That's something that we have to sit down and talk about and see what's out there. I think... You know, I think we ought to talk about this over here. We've been spending more time on the road... Can I talk to you? Well, sure! You was lovely tonight. Thank you. You sing really nice. Aw, you think so? I know so. I just wanna know, what plans do you have now? I plan to go straight home and go straight to bed cuz I am worn out. We just got off the road. My dad is having a breakfast downtown. At 2 o'clock in the morning? Yes, at 2 o'clock in the morning. You know, I really do need to sleep. You can sleep tomorrow. There's gonna be people down there that will be very advantageous to your career. My career? Yes. What exactly are you proposing? Breakfast! Are you gonna turn out to be a nice man? Yes. Cross your heart and hope to die? Yes. Well, gimme a chance to get out of this U.S. mailbox. Hey, Dad? Dad, excuse me. I'd like you to meet Thiola Rayfield. This is my dad, Harlan, and his friends. Hey, how you doing? Nice to see all of you. Grab a seat. Good to meet you. Pull up a chair. Can we scoot in here? A little late, sorry. Make yourself at home. Have you met Judge Bolen, sits on the circuit court here in Austin? Good to meet you. Nice to meet you, sir. So Dad, what did you think about Thiola's band tonight? Damn fine. I think you ought to call old man Durham. See about booking them in Alton's. Hal Durham? At The Grand Ole Opry? Yeah. One and the same. Justice has been booking some local talent into the alternate in-spots. Dad, I'd like to send him a tape first. Wait a minute, you move a little fast for me. We didn't discuss a tape. I would just simply like to make a tape of you. I got a ton of tapes, I'll just give you one of the ones we've already got made up. I was thinking in terms of renting some studio time and making some brand new ones. Take her down to see Billy Wan in Houston. He can be the one to take charge of her. [Justice laughs] Billy Wan? Billy Wan has been dead for 10 years, Dad. Have you been drinking too much? Don't you mock me, boy! I'm not mocking you. I heard you! I heard you! He's just baiting you. Have a seat. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Maybe we should take him home. No, no, no, no. He's okay. He's been doing this for decades. You want to eat something? Well, I guess I could. Dad? Dad? Dad? Yo, Dad! Over here! They've got a waiter? Is there a waiter around here that can help feed us? Listen, I don't think Ben liked the idea of you coming here with me tonight. Ben don't care what I do in my spare time. Well, you sure could have fooled me. Is he an ex? No! No? Ben's my friend! Ben's the best friend I got in the whole world. Well, that's good. So who makes the decisions? We all do, except for the business, Ben does all of that, it's his group, he had it years before I came along. Yeah. And you just sing? More or less. So what made you decide you wanted to get in the nightclub business? The nightclub business? Yeah. [laughing] Oh, boy! Okay. It was my dad. My dad is known as The Singing Judge. No kidding? No kidding. He always wanted to be a country star, but he settled for a seat on the bench instead, and he operated a couple of those clubs so he'd have a place to sing. So I kind of grew up in it. You know? It's kind of in my blood! Show business! Sounds like you had an interesting childhood. Yeah, I did. Listen, Thiola, I want you to know something, I've managed acts before and I'm good. And the truth is I'd like to manage yours. Oh, we don't make enough money to pay a manager, so don't be telling me how many big contracts you can get for us. No, no, no, that's not what I'm gonna say. What I'm gonna say to you is that I can help you. Well then, talk to Ben about it! I already told you, Ben does all the business. Did I make you mad at me? Oh, it's just habit, I guess. Everybody's got some kind of big deal and I just don't wanna hear that from you. Why not? Well, because... I'm beginning to like you, Justice Parker, so don't blow it! So this is your house? It's where I live. This is nice. Listen, I'm sorry I kept you out so late. Don't apologize, I had a good time. You did? I did! So did I. Now, I know your alarm bells are probably ringing off the hook right now, but I can tell you I'm not anyone to be afraid of. Well, I don't think that you are. Good. Ben said that you guys could probably play three nights next weekend and that's when I'll have my license. That'll be great! Can I see you any time before then? I don't think so, I have to go see my mom. Why don't you bring her down here? I mean, where does she live? She's in a special place, she needs care. Oooh. But I'll be back on Thursday. Okay. I can see you Thursday. That would be perfect. Well, good! Okay. Thursday. Hi. You mean "bye." I feel like a teenager. Goodnight. Goodnight, Thiola. I just don't see how you can be thinking of us getting into business with that guy, T, I mean, he's gonna take a whole lot more than he's gonna give. He's a good promoter, Ben, you can't deny his success. It's your heart I'm worried about him promoting. If you remember, in 1988, that cowboy boy... Hey! That was a long time ago and I'd just as soon not talk about that, if you don't mind. Look, I just don't want to see you get into a position where you might get hurt. I'm a big girl! I appreciate how you care about all of us. But it's like you said, Ben, we could use the business! T! Ben, I've made up my mind. We're not exactly living the lifestyle of the rich and famous here. Oh, great! Women! [SONG: "Say It's True"] If it's me you long to touch and you want me just as much as I want you, say you do. If your words get in the way of the things you wanna say, say it anyway, and say it's true. If the love you feel inside is too strong to be denied, why don't you just let it through? If the feeling is really real, and if it's how you really feel... ...Wait, wait a minute. [music stops] Justice: That's okay, Ben. Ben, that's okay. That's okay. Listen, I think we ought to overdub some of Thiola's vocals, so you guys can take the rest of the afternoon off. It sounds great! Take a break! Very good! Very good! You guys go home and get some rest. Okay? Okay? I'm gonna manage you properly. I'm gonna manage you properly. That's good. Ben, do you think you could probably take these home over the weekend and study them up a little bit, and that way we could save some time on some sessions Monday? Don't worry about it, I got it all right here. I'll see you later, Ben. It sounded good! It sounds very good. Thanks. Thank you. Ahhh! So what song do you want to start with? Well, let's see. I'm starving. I don't remember recording that one. No, I don't even know a few bars, I just... I'm starving. Does this mean we're not gonna overdub? Uh, I used that as an excuse to get you alone. So now you're stuck with buying me dinner. Right? I'm gonna cook you dinner. Cook? Yes, ma'am. I thought you were staying in a hotel. No, no, no, no. Dad moved home, the club opened, I wanted to hang out and have some fun, so I rented an apartment. And now you think you're a cook? I know I'm a cook. Well, we'll see about that. Okay! Uh! I'm full. Do you like it? It was very good. Best steak I've had all night! I wanna know where you go when you go see your mama. To a home. Mama used to... Well, she used to drink a lot and she got real sick from it several years ago and she never did get any better. When did you learn to sing? Oh, I always wanted to be a singer. I never studied though. Really? No, I never got real serious about it until Ben. He's the one who got me real involved in it. Ben? I don't think he likes me very much. I think Ben don't know what to make of you yet. Oh, yeah? Well, what about you? Do you know what to make of me yet? I know you're trouble, I know that! Trouble? What does that mean? Well, you're the kind of guy that always gets me in trouble. That's what I mean. God, I hope so! [Thiola narrating] A few weeks later, Justice was true to his word and booked us as Willie's special guest at The Grand Ole Opry. Alright, how you doin' there? Good to see you! Howdy, hey! How you doing? Ben, how are you, man? Pretty good, pretty good. Only took you 20 years, huh? 22, which is not as long as it took you! Well, some of us are less fortunate, I guess. Mr. Willie Nelson, it's good to see you, sir. Nice to see you. Is this old boy taking care of you? Yeah, he's treating me real good. How you doing, Willie? -I'm fine. We really thank you for being willing to introduce us tonight. My pleasure. Maybe we'll even get to sing a song together. Oh, that'd be great! Yeah, man! It's about time ya'all got some recognition around here. Well, thank you. Let's go outside and check out the new sound system. I'll see you in a minute. Alright. There's something I want to talk to you about, it probably ain't none of my business. What, Justice? Well, like I say, I probably shouldn't say anything but he has a way of distracting the women that he brings up here in his bands. It's too late, Willie, they're already talking about moving in together. Well, you're just getting ready to get your big shot, so I thought I should tell you. He's what she likes, I guess. There's no accounting for her taste in men but we've been down this road before and she knows the drive. Well, sometimes he can get crazy and mean. She knows that drive too. Thank you very much. Thank ya'all very much. Thank you very much, I appreciate that. This next band is really something special. They've been out on the highway a long time kicking up dust and they finally made it up here to Nashville to the Grand Ole Opry. How about a big welcome for a little songbird, Thiola Rayfield, and my good friend, Ben Rayson? Big T and the Texas Wheel! Thank you, very much! That's real nice of you. We know you don't know us well enough to treat us that nice, but we know it's cuz you love Willie. We all love Willie! We kind of grew up singing with Willie back in Austin. We're home folks, so it made it real special. So, uh, I guess I'm ready if you are. Thank you, Willie! [SONG: "Road Happy"] Road happy! Happy to be leaving! Happy to be headed home! Road happy! Happy for my freedom! The years, the miles and I keep rolling on. The engine and these humming wheels sing a lullaby, Rocks me like a cradle, and contented as a child. I watch the world go by me - front, center, left and right from town to town. Road happy, will I ever settle down? Willie said it best when he wrote "On the Road Again." Like Willie, I am out here making music with my friends, just one big happy family with a common bond that holds our hearts and minds together out here on the road. We share the disappointments, the laughter and the tears. As thick as thieves and gypsies, we roll on through the years. Road angels on the highway, with our dreams on the wing, we pick and sing. Road happy cuz we're on the road again. [SONG: "On the Road Again"] Thiola: Oh, and speaking of! Here's the king of the road, Willie Nelson! Or was that Roger Miller? Pardon me, farmer, I must be in the wrong song! Help us out now, Willie! On the road again. Like a band of gypsies, we go down the highway! We're the best of friends, insisting that the world keep turning our way. And our way Is on the road again. I just can't wait to get on the road again. The life I love is making music with my friends. I can't wait to get on the road again! Road happy cuz we're on the road again! Thank you, Willie! Thank you, Ben! [laughter, chatter] Two curtain calls, that's a real good start, gentlemen. Talk about the big time! I think we could all get used to this... success stuff! Let me tell you something: This will bring us some real serious label attention. Hey, we gotta go on the road next week, Justice. This label attention is great and everything, but I got a band to take care of. Look, everybody is gonna be taken care of. Not taken care of, man! We've been together a long time, we've been able to take care of ourselves. Hey, will you guys just knock it off? Good grief! One night on television and a few beers and we think we're stars! Well, I think we should just get our country butts back to the hotel. Wait a minute, what am I supposed to do about these road dates? I mean, am I supposed to just call them up and say, "Excuse me, we're too busy getting famous in Nashville to honor our commitments"? Let me tell you something: I am not your enemy here. I am here to help. I am here to help every one of us. Now granted, I can't sing, I can't play music, but you are managing yourself into bankruptcy. Now somebody please tell me, what are we fighting for? Huh? For 5 years, man, it's just been us! I know. Us! Together. I'm not used to somebody else making the decisions. Ben. I'll cancel the dates, T, we'll do it his way. That's very smart, Ben. Thank you, very much. I know it's been a long, hard road for every one of us. I think we should be happy we found each other. We found each other, let's be happy. Come on, come on! Realtor: There is so much light in this house! I mean, look at all these windows! I want ya'all to come over here and look at this view. And this deck back here is just an excellent place for entertaining. The owner just had it refinished before he put it up for rent. And look at this kitchen! I mean, it's an absolute dream! It is a dream. It's nice. You don't like this? Well, I always dreamed of a big house with blue shutters. Yeah? Okay. Well, did you know all my life, I've been dreaming of an angel like you and a house with blue shutters? So now you have everything you ever wanted? You know, I've never ever been this happy. You're supposed to say, "Me too!" Well, if I say "me too," are you gonna run away? Of course not. Well, that makes most men nervous. It smacks of commitment. I'm not nervous. See, I have real bad habit of holding back til I just wanna jump off a bridge from the ache. Mmm-hmm. And then I go too far, when I feel a trust in someone. That's always been a disaster for me in the past. Well, guess what? The disasters for both of us are over now. And that's the truth. Well, then I'm happy. [cars rushing] ...great. You're doing a good job. I'm doing a good job? I told you I could manage. You know, I just wish I had the faith in me that you do. I have great faith in you, darling. Now, wait! Wait, wait! I forgot my keys Oh, no! I'll go on to the car. -Will you be okay here? I'll be right back! Excuse me. -Yeah? Don't you play in a band? Yeah! The Texas Wheel! You know us? I knew I recognized you! I saw you years ago when you first started playing at The Armadillo Headquarters. Uh-huh. Yeah! I used to play there all the time, that was a great place. Now wasn't that a hoot? You had those great pigtails! -I don't know how great those were! They closed that place down. That's what I hear and that's too bad cuz that was a great place to play. All the performers loved that. You playing The Paramount? We're trying to get booked in there, but... Excuse us! She's off duty right now! I was just... You just go! You're not wanted here! Justice! I can't leave her alone for two minutes... Oh, Justice, he was just... You stay outta this! You know what he wants? Do you know? -Well, he was... Hey, just a minute! I wanna ask you something. I wanna ask you something. Do you always hit on women you don't know? Man, what are you talking about? -Justice, stop it! [SLAP!] Don't tell me what to do! Come here! Come here! Come here! Come here! Where are you going? Come on, Thiola. I didn't hit you on purpose, I was protecting you from him. You hit me. It was an accident. I promise, from my heart, I will never hit you again. Oh, you've got that right. Let me tell you something. Look, this is no longer a part of my life! I'm sorry. Please don't leave me. I will leave you. No. I may love you more than anything on earth but I have no intentions of turning out like my mama. [gentle guitar] Cover up a heart that's broke, hide the hurt I won't let show, pretending I am fine and all is well. Can't say I ever understand, it isn't something that I planned. I watch my dreams of Heaven turn to Hell. [guitar slows to finish] Billy, Billy, Billy! You've got a spot right above your brush - right there! Right in there! You're getting paid by the hour! [laughs] You got a regular Ozzie and Harriet show going on over here. Yeah! Where's David and Ricky? How are you? Uh, Thiola's out buying some new stuff and uh, well, she'll be back any minute. But the reason I called ya, I wanna have a heart-to-heart chat with ya. Well, what about, Justice? Well, among other things, I don't want there to be any bad blood between us. Me either. Good. I mean, look, we both have her interest at heart. Now, granted, I can't get up there and make music for her every night, she needs you for that. Justice, you can hire a band on an hour's notice. Ben, she respects you. I can't hire a band that's been with her for years and she trusts 100%. So what exactly do you want from me? Commitment. And no interference. No interference? I don't know what you mean by that. Hey, I got a band to look after, Justice, and they've got families. Now, I know your reputation and it's hard for me to bet my future and my band's future on a guy like you. Look, we're not betting your future, we're betting our future. Look, let's don't pretend we don't know what's going on. Let's not pretend that. The fact is, she chose me. Now, my first question to you is: Can you live with that? I can live with it. Good. I'm glad to hear that. I want to show you something. Come here. [Thiola imitates Minnie Pearl] Howdy! Hey, what did you do, buy out the whole store? Well, it looks like it, doesn't it? How much money did you spend? Oh, money, money, money! It's amazing to me that a man can get by without even so much as a skillet in the house. How you doing, Ben? Good to see you! Good to see you, too. So did you two work out what's bothering you? Yes. Good. Cuz we're a team, and we are gonna stay a team! Yes, we're a team! Oh! I got something I wanna show you! Oh, great! You gotta see this! It's a surprise for you. T, what's -- what's that on your face? Oh, I fell in the shower the other day. Lord, I'm clumsy as a cow! It ain't nothing, Ben. Look at this! -Oh, yay! Here it is! This is gonna make you a star! Here, put it on! It's gonna help make you a star. -Come on, come on, come on! Here you go, I hope we got the right size. Is that the right size? -Oh, it's great! This is the new clothes for the band. Yeah, there we go. Oh my God, think of the spotlight. BOOM! -It looks good! Look at that, look at that, look at that! Isn't that beautiful? That's great! Where's the camera? See if it's still over there by the mail. Get the camera! Good, good, good! Come on, Ben, smile like you're on top of the world! -Big smile! That looks great! [SONG: "Swingin' Like Tarzan and Jane"] I was strollin' down the avenue the other day when all of a sudden something stood in my way. It was a big ol' man with a long lion's mane. He said Me Tarzan! You Jane! Before I could reply he grabbed me by the hand and said, Let's boogie woogie down to jungle land! We were swingin'! Swingin'! Swingin' like Tarzan and Jane! Swingin'! Swingin'! Swingin' like Tarzan and Jane We were swingin' with the band in jungle land, We were swingin' like Tarzan and Jane! Take it, Tarzan! Up jumped the monkey, dancin' real funky, he was a real Fred Astaire. As the lions assembled, all the antelopes trembled and said, Let's get outta here! Hyenas were laughing and jumping around, Dancin' to the rhythm that was goin' down! They were swingin'! Swingin'! Swingin' like Tarzan and Jane! Swingin'! Swingin'! Swingin' like Tarzan and Jane! We were swingin' with the band in jungle land, We were swingin' like Tarzan and Jane! Whoo! Me Jane. [song ends, awkward applause] We do thank you. Good! Good! What'cha doin' out here? Thinking. No, you're not! You're drinkin'! And it's a well-known fact that a man can't drink and think at the same time. I can. I thought the show went pretty good tonight, didn't you? Yeah. Justice, what's bugging you? Nothing. Hey, it's me! And you can share with me! I told you, nothing was wrong. Why don't you just leave me alone? That is a great idea. Where are you going? We're not through talking yet! Justice, you just wanna pick a fight and I don't want to play this game. Wait a minute. Oh, God. You're right. I'm sitting in the room in there feeling sorry for myself. I don't see why! You've got everything a man could want in this world! I know. And I don't plan to lose it. Oh God, I put you in a bad show tonight. [phone ringing] Driver: No sound check tonight. Bus leaves at 8:30! Thiola: Got that? Ben: Yeah, we got it. There's a dollar deposit on these keys, so ya'all bring them back. A dollar? Who's got a dollar in this crowd? I could sell this for a dollar. Hey, you guys seen Thiola? Nope? No? Have you seen T? T? No, I haven't seen her. You don't know where she is? I haven't seen her anywhere. Have you seen Thiola? Dammit! Oh! Thiola! I wanna talk to you. Give me this. How you doing? Fine. You okay? I feel better now that I'm here. Baby, you alright? Please, don't ever think of leaving me. Nobody's going anywhere. Oh, I'm just such a screw-up! I want things to be different now. Justice, what's happened? Oooh! My dad. Nothing I ever do is right, where he's concerned. He blames me for everything. Baby, you're okay. I need you. Justice, you're not a little boy, and I'm not your mommy. Yeah. And if he bothers you that much, you shouldn't be around him! Come on up to the room, I gotta get ready for the show. Hey! Are you starting to run out of patience with me? There's somewhere I wanna take you when we get to Waco next week. Aw, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! I don't know if I wanna do this! Oh, don't freeze up on me now! Yeah, but you said she doesn't even know where she is, so how's she gonna know if I'm not there? Well, I am gonna know! Come on! [singing] Farther along, we'll know all about it. Farther along, we'll understand why. Yes, we'll understand it, all by and by. Do you think she hears you when you sing to her? I hope so. Is she gonna ever get any better? Aw, nobody knows. She had a liver operation about a month ago, and then she had a stroke. She's been laying like this ever since. She's lucky. [scoffs] She's lucky? Yeah. To have you as a daughter. To have somebody who will always be there for her. Oh, I will be. Long as I can be. This place ain't cheap, you know. Yeah well, you don't have to worry about that anymore. We're on a roll. I'm not worried about it, it just is. I love you. I know. Watch your step. You okay? Oh, I get like this every time I come up here and see her. Yeah. Justice, how come you never talk about your mama? Did she and Harlan get divorced when you was little? She's dead. I'm sorry. Yeah, so am I. Well, what happened to her? Well, she blew her brains out. When I was four. I never got to know her too much, I got some photos. My God, Justice, that is so sad! Yeah, you know, my dad blamed me. He said I cried too much, depressed her. I didn't realize until I was 30 years old why he hated me so much, and I can't tell you how lonely that makes you feel. You came along and saved me, baby. You were entirely worth saving. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Why? Well, did it ever occur to you that I might have been lonely too? Oh Thiola, you have men chasing you everywhere you go. Yeah, and every single one of them trying to prove how they can take care of me. Well, I've been taking care of me for a long time. So do you wanna take care of your lost boy? No, I wanna take care of my man. The little boy is cute, but it's the man I fell in love with. Please don't forget that. Justice: I told you not to leave until I said you could go! Well, you were hurting me! No, I wasn't! Yes, you were! Well, are you done for the night? Oooh, I hate you when you're like this! Like what? Angry! I'm not angry at you. I'm angry at me! Well, I think your logic is a little twisted! Am I supposed to just not hurt? I watched my mama go through this and I swore this would never happen to me! Everybody fights! Everybody don't hit! I must be crazy! No, you're not crazy. You just hit me in the face and I'm still here! No, you're still here because you know I really love you. That's true. And I even understand your pain, I have enough of it inside myself, but I'm not willing to give up my dignity and self-respect just because you've lost yours. Do you understand? Do ya? I understand. It's all I've got. [SONG: "Leave That Cowboy Alone"] He's got eyes as big as Texas, a smile just as wide. That handsome stallion makes me wanna mount up and ride. I've got the urge to chase him and make him my own. Better leave that cowboy alone! You'd better leave that, leave that cowboy alone! He's wilder than a gopher and he's bound to do you wrong. A drifter like the cowboys in those old western songs. Better leave that cowboy alone! I'd like to corral him, rope and tie him down, place my brand upon him, pin him to the ground! But I know his reputation, I'd best just get along and leave that cowboy alone! I'd better leave that, leave that cowboy alone! He's wilder than a gopher -Uh, huh! and he's bound to do me wrong! A drifter like the cowboys in those old western songs. Better leave that cowboy alone! He's got me running loco, I've tumbled like a weed, Head over heels in love but I could never tame that steed, Home is where the heart is -- his home is on the range, and no matter how I'd like to think he could, he'll never change! Beter leave that, leave that cowboy alone! His words are made of sand and his heart's made outta stone! I'd best get off my high horse before I do get thrown, and leave that cowboy alone! Oh, I'd better throw my hat in and ride off on my own and leave that cowboy alone! Leave him alone, T! [song ends] Hey! Hi, there. How you doin'? Good to see you! -How are you? Good. Hey, look who we got! Champion Fiddle Player of all time here! [the Franklins fiddle, the band jams] You hungry? I got a lotta food. Shhhh! I'm trying to hear this. What took you so long? Oh! Whooo! -I hope it's not too small when you get it on. Sexy! It's funny how you always get 'em too small. This is Larry's dad. Excuse me. Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, please. [music stops] We don't have time for any playing around any more. We gotta get back at it. Gotta get to work. Justice, but he came all the way down here to play with him. But I have already paid for the studio time, so we must get back to work. I got some food out here. Food in the studio if you want it, just before we get back to work. Play the fiddle later. That was good, boys. Somebody here to see you. Oh, my gosh! Oh, I -- Oh, my gosh! You certainly have a way with words, Justice. Oh! Oh, my gosh! Is this what you wanted? You're gorgeous! You are gorgeous! Oh my - my heart's in my throat. Good. Is this alright? You silly man. Women don't mind this sort of thing. Don't you know that by now? Oh, boy! Oh, boy! You got me. What are you doing out here in the middle of the night? You alright? Come on back to bed, baby. There's something I wanna clarify with you first. You're like a worthless slut. You tell me what kind of a woman would wear those anyway? Well, I thought that was what you wanted! I was trying to make you happy! I don't respect women who dress like that. Justice, don't do something you're gonna be-- Gaw! -Stop it! Oh! [groans] Oh baby, what have you done now? Thiola: Sorry I'm late, guys! It couldn't be helped! We were about to go on without you, you know. Not on the dates I book! She's the act. So I'm beginning to notice. Don't you forget it! Come on, guys! Why don't you go get set up? I won't be as long as you think. Ben, can you help me get ready? Yeah, yeah. Let's go, let's do it. I have never missed a gig in my life! And you aren't gonna miss one tonight! We got a late start out of Austin, don't make a big deal out of it. T? Oh Ben, now don't go getting crazy on me right now, I need your help. Why do you let him do this to you? Ben, where I'm from, a woman stands by her man. She don't just run off at the first sign of trouble. The first sign? It's a cultural thing. T, you go up and visit your mama all the time. You see what standing by a man who will beat you will do! You're not stupid. I know he can't help himself! And if I don't stand by him, I know he'll never get any better. And besides, I love him! And he loves me! So come here. Help me paint these bruises cuz we got a show to do. I can't. You have to, Ben. You have to help me! And you have to understand! I will not help him kill you. Ben, if you really wanna help me, don't do this to me now. Emcee: Ladies and gentlemen, I wanna really hear it now for the hottest band in Texas, and Texas means the world! Big T and the Texas Wheel! I have an announcement to make before we start the show tonight. I just want to tell you that, uh, Ben Rayson, the guy that founded The Texas Wheel has decided to leave the band, and seek his fortunes elsewhere. Of course, we're gonna all miss him a bunch, and we really wish him well wherever his journeys may take him. But as they say, the show... Well, you know the rest. [Song: "Wild Texas Wind"] Don't ask me if I'm crying. Can't you see it ain't raining? No, this ain't sand in my eyes. Before it has been spoken, when one good heart gets broken, that's enough to make a cowgirl cry. Cuz here I am all by myself, my man, he just up and left! Said he would never try again. And now the thing that hurts me most, when he makes up his mind to go, he'll be gone like a wild Texas wind. Like a wild Texas wind! Oh, my man is gone again, and I feel lonesome settin' in. Like a wild Texas wind. Like a wild Texas wind! Oh, my man is gone, he's gone, he's gone again. And I feel lonesome settin' in. Like a wild Texas wind. [song ends] Thank you. Thank you. [Thiola narrating] A few weeks later, the thing Justice had worked the hardest for and hoped for the most finally came through. I'll bet you're wondering what this is! I give up, what is it? -Come here. Let me show ya. Dear Mr. Parker and Miss Thiola Rayfield, We are pleased to inform you that subject to further negotiations concerning terms... Read it with me! We would like to extend to Big T and the Texas Wheel warmest wishes in welcoming you to The Golden Spur Record label! [Thiola squeals] Oh, does this mean they're gonna record us? Oh, record us, hell! This is a ticket to promotions, sales, concert tours with the biggest acts. This is the beginning of your dream! Oh, gosh! I'm so happy! I've worked so hard on this! What's wrong? I thought you'd say something. Well, I'm happy, I just wish Ben was here to share this with us. He deserves this so much. I've got everybody I know out looking for him. What is this? [Justice laughs] You look cute with that yard dirt on your face. Awww! What have you been doing? I've been planting flowers. In a rented house? Well, what's that got to do with growing things? Well, we're gonna make so much money that I'm gonna buy a house for us and you can have a BIG garden! Are you? -Yes! Don't you think we should make this album before we spend the money from it? I love you, Thiola. I don't know how I ever got this lucky. Well, I think we both got pretty lucky. [SONG: "Speakin' of the Devil"] Speakin' of the devil, he is driving me wild with that wicked little grin and all that fire in his eyes! He's got me dreamin'! Got me steamin'! Oooh, well speakin' of the devil, it feels mighty close to heaven and I'd go through hell to make him mine. Yeah! Oooh, speakin' of the devil, well, here he comes now, lookin' like an angel, got my defenses down. He's got me dreamin'! Got me schemin'! Whoo, speakin' of the devil, he is drivin' me wild with that wicked little grin and all that fire in his eyes! He's got me dreamin'! Got me steamin'! Oooh, and speakin' of the devil, it feels mighty close to heaven and I'd go through hell to make him mine. Yeah, and I'd go through hell to make him mine, yeah! Thiola? Ben! Oh, Ben! Where did you go? Oklahoma to work. Oklahoma? He took some finding. I'm sure! Oh, come here, Justice! Thank you! Are you happy? Oh, I'm so happy! Welcome home! [Song: "Tall Man"] Ben: Well, I wish I was a kissin' tree, a-growing from the ground, And every time my sweetie passed by, I'd throw some kisses down. He's big and tall and handsome but bashful as can be! Well, I know she wants some kisses of mine but she won't climb my tree. Oh, I will! I love a tall man! Well, I ain't no small man! My man is all man, And the only one for me. Thiola: Aw, talk to me, cowboy! Ben: One night out on the prairie, Man: Hey, your old man's here, Ben: the moon was shinin' bright, Man: stone cold drunk. Ben: she put her arms around about me Man: He wants to see you in the office. Ben: and things was a-going right Thiola: He talked and talked of Texas Ben: Yep! Thiola: and drawled his Texas drawl. Ben: Ya'all Thiola: Then the moon went down and the sun came up and he never kissed me at all! But I love a tall man! Ben: Well, I ain't no small man! Thiola: You got that right! My man is all man and the only one for me! Well, I was a kissin' tree out on the lone prairie. What would you do? Then everytime my sweetie passed by, she'd steal a kiss from me. And if you want more kisses -Uh, huh! Here's all you have to know. Ben: What's that? 01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:54,000 Just plant me down in a Texas town and watch them kisses grow! I love a tall man! Well, I ain't no small man! [music continues, muffled] Dad? I meant to drive down to Houston. Took a wrong turn on the interstate. You know, I'm looking at you tonight and it's like I'm seeing you for the first time. Oh, and you don't like what you see? Don't matter what I like, don't matter what I don't like, what matters is I've outgrown you! [laughing] I hate you! You know that? You're just like your mother. You're always taking, you're never giving. Ungrateful bitch. Oh, I see. Is that why you've been drunk for 30 years? You know, all the whiskey in the world can't put that fire out. No. You've got that - you've got it wrong again. See, it was you that put the hurt in me, blaming me for what she did, just like it was my fault. I never blamed you. In fact, I thought you was the one that was lucky. She didn't have to do that to me. I would have given that woman anything. You need to sleep this off. [arguing] Lay down. Lay down! Lay down! Please pass out! Lay down! It's that damn woman! She's changed you. I love that woman. [Harlan laughs] Let me tell you something. Come here! What? No, come here! Come close! Come here! What is it? What do you want? The thing I wanna tell you, it's really important that you know how I feel about you. It's not the whiskey, not the fights we've had, but how I really feel about you down deep. What is that? [Harlan spits] Hey, Jake! Hey T, how you doing? I'm good. You seen Justice? He been in tonight? Yeah, he's back in the office with his old man. Oh, I didn't know Harlan was here. Came down about 2 hours ago, drunker than hell. That figures. [Justice yells] Oh Justice, just cut it out! What's wrong? You're drunk. No, I'm not. Do you still love me? Don't! Where you going? -Justice, stop it! Don't run away from me! Come here! -I said stop it! Are you scared? Yes, I'm scared! What's wrong? I'm scared for you -- you need help! Some kind of help I don't know how to give you! Where are you going? [SLAP!] Stop it! I am leaving and I ain't coming back! Proud of me? Yeah? Hey Tim, do you know where she is? She went to see her mama. You wouldn't lie to me, would ya? I might, but I ain't lying now. God, she hasn't returned any of my phone calls for a week! She's been gone a week! Where is she? She hasn't returned your phone calls cuz you're a jerk of the first water, partner, and she got tired of being your personal punching bag. I'm sorry. Okay? In your case, that's not an apology, that's a reference to your character. Ben? Listen, would you please ask her to call me when she... Whoa! Miss Rayfield? When are you gonna give me a chance to talk to you? Well, I'm listening. Good. Please hear me then. I want you to know, from the deepest part of my heart, I apologize. You're looking at me like you're shooting daggers out of your eyes. Don't you know I really miss you? So? Would you please tell me what it is you want me to do? Get out of my life, for starters! Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Please! Don't put your hands on me, Justice. Okay, I understand, I won't touch you. Now you understand this, please. I'm so ashamed. You don't know how bad I feel. Well, I know that hitting on me and all these other women that you've banged around on ain't gonna hurt your mama! She's dead! She don't feel it anymore! But I can. Thiola! Hey, Jake. Hi, T. Hello, Ben. -How you doing? Is Justice in? He'll be back tomorrow. You knew we split up? I heard about that. And I left my sheet music in his office, I need to get it out. You wanna come back and watch us, make sure I only get what belongs to me? Oh hell, T, I trust you more than I do him. Oh thanks, Jake, we won't be long. You take your time. Most of the stuff's over here, but I'm still missing one red folder. See if it's somewhere on the desk. [gunshot, Thiola screams] Ben, my lord! What are you doing, you big young'un? Don't mess with people's stuff! Good lord, you scared my heart out! And look what you did, that's purdy! What are we gonna do about that picture? Oh, he'll never notice that. I could do it, you know. Do what? Shoot him. You're as crazy as he is! Let's get outta here! Jake! Well T, what do you wanna do now? I want to live happily ever after. I mean other than a fairytale. Well, I really think the record label will be willing to work with us, we'll just give Justice part of what we earn, I wouldn't wanna begrudge him of that. Well, I think we ought to just make a clean break of things. Just go back on the road, make another record, get another record company, just start over again. Oh, he'd sue us to hell and back! Oh, let him sue us. I'm trying to find ways to get him out of my life, Ben, not spend the next 10 years in a court fight. Okay look, I'll go over and talk to him and we'll work something out, ya know. Oh, he ain't gonna talk to you! Well, I sure as hell ain't gonna let him talk to you again! He knows it's over. Besides, we'll have a much better chance on him quitting claim on that contract if I ask him. What if he asks you to stay with him? I'll never go back. You still love him, though, don't you? Well, it all comes down to who you love the most, the man that beats you or the woman he beats, and I've answered that question. I ain't going back. And I got us into this mess and I'm gonna get us out. [knocking] Justice! You have a little trouble with that new lock? If you're looking for Justice, he's not here. Well, where is he? Don't know. You down here for a while? Oh, I'm just here to see Justice. Do you ever think about what you've done to him? Me? I didn't do anything to Justice he didn't allow. But then I guess you're sort of an expert on that sort of thing, aren't you? You are the saddest man I have ever met in my life. Me? Then you don't really know Justice very well, do you? [laughing] [Harlan spits] [laughs] Goodbye, mom. Justice? Where are you? I saw your car out front, I know you're in here. Come on out! [mocking] I know you're in here. Come on out. That's what my mother used to tell me when I hid in the basement. I came to talk to you about the band. [mocking] I came to talk to you about the band. But I'll come back when you feel better. We can talk now. I don't want to talk now. Don't do this, Justice, please don't. You don't know what you're doing! I know exactly what I'm doing. If you hurt me, I swear I'll kill you! [Thiola screams] Well, this is a helluva night to be out in the elements. I'm looking for T, have you seen her? No. Who wants to know? I'm Ben Rayson, you know who I am. Oh, my son doesn't have anything to do with that band anymore, so head on down the road! Hold on a second. She is not here. Well, she's been here. What about Justice? Neither one. Did you try down at the club? She said that's where she was headed. Wait a minute. You said she hadn't been here. I thought you meant this evening. That was earlier today. Look, she went to talk to Justice about the band, she didn't come back. Now, given his history, I'd say that's reason to worry. I don't know where they are, and that's the truth. Do you want me to help you look for her? Suit yourself. [Willie Nelson's rendition of "My Songbird" plays] Songbird in a golden cage. She prefers the blue. How I crave the liquor of her song. Poor bird who has done no harm, what harm could she do? She shall be my prisoner her life long. My songbird wants her freedom, now don't you think I know? But I can't find it in myself to let my songbird go. No, I just can't let her go. Excuse me! Did you see a blond woman? She was driving a Cadillac out back. No. Is there trouble of some sort? Yeah, yeah. I'm looking for her. Try the bathroom at the back of the station, she might have gone in there. Thanks! T? T, you in there? T? My God, we've been looking all over town for you! Where the hell have... Go call an ambulance. Look what he did to me, Ben! Look what I let him do to me! Doc! How is she? Well, nothing's broken. Oh, good. Well, when can I see her? Well, I guess she went home. I wasn't going to admit her unless she requested it. She told me to tell you that she was okay, and then she left. I thought she had a ride. Can I help you? [gunshot] Excuse me. I saw a man being taken out of here in another police car, his name is Ben Rayson. Would you find him and tell him that I'm alright? Sure, I'll find him. He's in the city jail. For what? Murder. You shouldn't have come here, T. This is not a nice place. Well then, we'll just have to get you out of it, won't we? Not much chance of that. How you healing up? Oh, I'm fine, I just look awful, that's all. Oh well, how's the band? The band's good. Good, good, I sure do miss those guys. They're a good bunch. And water-tight as a bullfrog's bottom! Ben, you could get the death penalty! Well, at least he won't hurt you anymore. Oh, I was so stupid. How did we manage to get our lives so screwed up? I don't know about you, but I had to work awful hard to get mine like this. I'm not letting you do this, you don't belong in here. Too bad, you ain't got a whole lot to say about this, T. [Thiola narrating] I knew Ben would gladly give his life for me, but I just couldn't let him do it. Miss Rayfield had something quite extraordinary to share with me a moment ago, and I think all of you should hear it. Miss Rayfield? Ben didn't kill Justice. I know he's willing to spend the rest of his life in prison to protect me, but Ben didn't kill Justice Parker! I did! T, are you nuts? [appalled lawyers chattering] Let's let her finish. Justice Parker was fond of putting lumps on my head every time he got a chance, but I was stupid enough to let him. Ben's prints were on that gun because he handled the gun one day when we were in the office together. My prints were on the gun too! I mean, Ben was seen coming out of the club because he was looking for Justice. I'm sure he was gonna beat him up, or probably get beat up, more than likely, but, oh, Ben wouldn't kill somebody. Are you crazy, T? You're not going to prison for me, Ben. You just be there to get me when I get out. Miss Rayfield, we can't just accept your word on this. Well, it's not just my word! My fingerprints were on that gun! And I was seen coming out of that building! And I was the victim of constant physical abuse! Do you know where the victim was shot? Do you? Right between the eyes! Judge: Thiola Rayfield, having taken into account the mitigating circumstances, this court sees a place for mercy in this case. However, since you did decide to take the law into your own hands instead of reporting this physical abuse to the proper authorities and, as a consequence of that decision, did kill another human being in cold blood, I find it necessary to sentence you to a period of incarceration of 20 years. [Thiola narrating] 7 months later, Harlan Parker was in the hospital. I don't give a damn about my liver, or my heart, or whatever in the hell else you people say is wrong with me. Hand me that basket. Not that basket, the trash basket! Damn dumb help, I swear to god! Alright. I wouldn't feed this crap to pigs or poor people. Maybe I could get you something else. The only thing you can get me is some bourbon and branch water. Are you crying? Huh? Are you crying? Come back in here, I'll give you something to cry about! What the hell is going on here? Go out there and call Judge Bolen. Wanna see him and that Ben Rayson, and an officer of the law, quick, cuz I got something to say. Doctor says you're doing better. No. Hell no, I'm not. I'm dying. Thank God! That's why I wanted to tell you about killing my son. Harlan! Cuz I'm not sorry about it, if that's what you want me to say. I'm not. It was time somebody put him down before he hurt anybody else. But that woman don't need to be sitting in jail. This don't have nuthin' to do with her. Nuthin'. [Thiola narrating] So that's the story of me and Ben and Justice. And in case you're wondering how I knew where Justice got shot, well, I didn't really, it was just a lucky guess. Or unlucky, depending on how you look at it. That her? Hey, that's the van! That's her. Oooh, boy! I see her now! You ready? It's her! Hey T, how's it feel to be free? Let me get me on the other side of this fence and I'll tell ya! Oh, they're all back! You remember this one? Yippie-i-ki-ay Yippie-i-ki-oh Yippie-i-ki-ee Big T! We're starting over! Let's get on the road and make some money at it! Welcome back. Thank you, Ben. Can't believe it. I'm amazed. [Thiola narrating] There are many kinds of love, all of them good -- or at least they should be. But the love of a true friend is the sweetest of all. What's important is this: When you count your friends and the ones that you love, you make sure to put yourself on the list. [Song: "On the Road Again"] Willie Nelson: On the road again, Willie & Thiola: like a band of gypsies, we go down the highway! We're the best of friends, insisting that the world keep turning our way. And our way is on the road again! I just can't wait to get on the road again! The life I love is making music with my friends, and I can't wait to get on the road again! Road happy cuz we're on the road again! Captions provided by: A fan who spent a week creating captions!!
