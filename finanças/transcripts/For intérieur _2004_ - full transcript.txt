The Charm Box "Me" - Is this the right one? - Yes! Mimi picked it out. Well, I'll come get you when it's time. I fly away every day. - You don't really... - Not yet... Criguet! This is ridiculous! What he's done. Right up to his death, he was only an annoyance. Please! He is my father. Watch your mouth! The whole village is there. How do we face them? Everyone does a normal burial! It will leave your mother completely alone. What will the people think? Are you even listening to me? Button the collar too! Now stop all the racket! He wanted us to come. Well, I didn't. Oh, things aren't going so well? Come here. Here, Little One! A surprise! That was you, when you were one year old. Wait! A "Chateau Giscours," 1959. To the envious person's knee and beets! Such a rich aroma! Full-bodied. Should he gurgle once more? The funeral of the tin! Criguet! Even if it's true, nobody believes me! Oh, try this one! That's easy! That is Grandma. Yes! That is Grandma. - One more? - One more... This one's funny! Is that funny? - And that one there? - Oh no! Not that one...! No! - There's your Grandpa in it! - What do you know! Can we get on with the Procession? Oh, I see! Come! Tell me how you do this! You know, one does not like some noises and other... Alright, I'll do it. Oh, damn! Just listen sometimes, how nice! - And that one there? - Oh no, no! It will leave your mother completely alone. Oh, damn!
