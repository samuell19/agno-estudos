This film is based on true stories from testimonies of Japanese Military Sexual Slavery 'Comfort Women' victims. Yes, so after your confession, what was the reaction from people around you? They all said...that I am brave. Well I don't think they think all that much of it. I feel ashamed myself but there is not much of anything. Not much of any reaction at all. Do you still feel embarrassed? No I don't feel embarrassed at all. Then, how long did you suffer under the brutalities of the Japanese Military? Taken when I was 17 years old, I cannot talk about all of it. Just...can't.. Not in such short period of time. Taken and all the suffering caused by the soldiers... How can I list everything? I cannot express in words... Women are menstruating but they continue to abuse us irregardlessly They didn't care at all. They drag you like a piece of luggage, use you as they would like and when we are broken-sick so to speak, they trash you or kill you. So that was the situation... what can I say? So how were the rations? Like food or... Come out, come out, wherever you are Are you ready? 1943, Gyeongsangnamdo Province Geohchang Not yet. Come out, come out wherever you are. Hey you guys are too much. I told you it's no fun if you go too far. Did you hear? Uncle Dusik from downtown was taken by the Japanese Policemen. Really? My daddy said that he is going to war to become a soldier... If you become a soldier, does that mean you become Japanese? Idoit. Just because a Korean man becomes a solider. It doesn't mean he becomes Japanese. Hey watch what you say. Remember what our teacher told us? He said â€˜We are all Japanese.' Didn't he? It's no fun playing like this. Do you want to make a bet on the game? What will you wager? If you guys win I will give you this Wow wicked! What would you guys give me? I want that, your charm. No not this. Yeah, mom said we should never give this away. Fine then. Do you have any idea how rare these taffies are? Even if you give ten of those charms you can't even trade them for one of these taffies. Ok, I will be generous and give you back one. Here. Ok, I will be generous and give you back one. Here. What about me? Give mine back too. What about me? Give mine back too. We were told to never give this away to anyone. Why not? That trinket is like a special protection charm so it's bad luck to give it away. Who told you that absurd lie? My mother repeatedly told me! Well, I don't really care. Bye! - Sister! - Jungmin! Ari-ari-rang Suri-suri-rang A-ra-ri-ga-nat-ne. Daddy! Daddy! - Oh it's my dear puppy! - Daddy daddy! If you hit your head on the carrier, you will get a bump. Oh Jungmin, you are all grown up. Look on to me, look on to me, look on to me. Like you saw a flower blooming in winter, look on to me! Ari-arirang! Suri-surirang Arariga natne. Dear! Did you wait long? Jungmin you come here. What's wrong? You be quiet. What did you take from Misun? I didn't take anything. I won it on a bet. Give it to me. Now! Take this and give it back to Misun. Ah hurry and take it to her. Well, come in already. What did I tell you about stealing from the others? Nothing will work out for you and you will never get married! Oh dear. Daddy... At that age, they do reckless things. Don't be too mad. It's because you're spoiled her that's why she's so wild. Oh come on. Don't you know how scary the world is right now? They say the soldiers are coming up and taking people away. Rumors say that once they are taken, you never hear from them again and they all end up dead. A young child like her should be okay... But you should be careful. What if they take you, how can we manage? The world is so... Right. You are right. Jungmin. All I want for you is to grow up well and marry a good man. Okay? No please, it makes no sense! What is he saying? How can you just come and take her without any words in advance? No, please no. No... Are you... Jungmin? Yes. - Take her! - Yes! No! Please no! Without any words in advance! - Daddy! Daddy! - Oh dear. Please spare us. Please spare us. Hurry there's no time. Listen to me. You see these clothes. Look, look. Stop crying. I hid some money in these clothes. Now you learned Japanese at school right? Use this money in emergency to ask someone to take you to Geohchang. Okay? Now what did I tell you to do with this money? To ask someone to take me to Geohchang. That's right... That's right... Oh what will happen to a young child like you... She hasn't even been outside this town... How will I go on without you... Listen to me well. An old parable says 'if you keep your head and don't lose your wits, you will survive through anything'. Okay? This.. It's not very pretty. But if you keep this with you, you will be safe. And all bad omens can't touch you. Keep it on you. There's no time. Hurry up. Don't forget my name, your father's name, where your home is. Okay? Jungmin! Jungmin! Jungmin! Jungmin! Jungmin! Jungmin! Jungmin! 1991, Gyeonggido Yangpyeong Dumulmeori Such a young visitor. Is that your mother next to you? Yes. So, who brought you here? My husband came here once... Then what of your husband? He's no longer here. An ex-convict, released that day, broke into our house. And that's when your daughter stopped talking? My husband was... He got tangled up in a life about to end. And how about you? You should have stayed strong. I will keep your daughter here. But... She was born to be a shaman. She will only be ridiculed outside of the temple. Hi. My name is Aeri. What's your name? Mom... - Aeri. - Yes? Is everything alright with Eunkyung these days? Eunkyung? Yes.. ma'am. Anything difficult? She often wakes up in the middle of the night, crying, but she seems alright. Oh but sometimes. Yes. She mumbles to herself sometimes, as if she's talking to someone. Like a lunatic? Yes! Like a lunatic! Hey! Hey! We need to clean all these. Like this! Um excuse me... Me? Are you talking to me? Are you looking for someone? No it's ok. I've seen her so I am going now. Do you know her? Too well. But dear, who are you? Excuse me. An old man asked me to give you a message. Are you talking to me? Yes. An old man in white shirt and gray pants asked. White shirt? He told me to tell you that he must leave soon. Huh?! He said he wrote a message for you on the inside of the old wardrobe. He said to read it before it gets thrown out. Who? Who said that to you? Dear! Oh father! Father! Father!!! Father!!! My daughter, my daughter. I am sorry to put you through hardships for so long. Father... Please send my thanks to your husband. Father! Father! Father! Father! Does anyone know where we are going? I don't know, they just took me... Why are you all crying? You make me feel bad... I heard we are all going to a shoe factory. If that's so then why aren't they telling us anything? I am scared. Where are you from? From Sangju. I'm from Geohchang. Are you ok? Why are you shivering? Your body's on fire. Come here. What is this? It's a good luck charm called Gwe-bul-no-ri-gae. My mother made it for me. Don't touch it. It's my charm. I will get unlucky. I envy you. I don't have a mother. She died giving birth to my brother. Really? How old are you? I'm fifteen. You? I'm fifteen too. Same age. - Let's be friends? - Sure. You know, before I was taken away I always wanted to travel to Gyeongsung by train. Really? I have five younger siblings and the youngest is only a baby. I was so sick of them. I have no siblings. I am all alone. Really?! Wow! Lucky. Your parents must have adored you. No way! My dad cherishes me but my mom was mean to me. Well I wish I had a mom to tell me off. Really? Didn't your mother make that for you? Yes she did. I know. Every night after she hit me, she rubbed my legs and said sorry. I know she cared for me. She touched my chest when I slept and told me that I am all grown up and smiled. Are you crying? What? I don't cry. My mom said if I stay strong, I will return home. I envy you. Here. Just for once... You need to give it back to me when we get off the train. No it's okay. You keep it. I got separated with so many girls I've talked with on the way here. So if we get separated I think I will regret being so mean to you. so hold it. Okay... Thank you... Get off quickly! Hey you, all of you here, you there you, you, and you there. Get out! Hurry up! 1943, Mudan River Jilin, China Welco... Oh if it isn't you Songhee. How have you been? So the bad dream I had last night foretold of your visit. You will be in trouble for teasing a shaman. The fact that I am alive is trouble in itself. I better tease more. Sister, I am here to be measured for some new clothes. You can still sew right? Ugh. Where is your son? He's gone to the market. By the way, who is she? She's a new shaman in our temple. Really? Would you fit her a set of clothes too? There.. all done. - Her? - Yes. Auntie can you measure me too? Your mother made no mention of you. More reason to measure me, too. Eunkyung gets measured but not me? I have seniority! Give me that. Give it to me quickly. It's nice to finally meet you all. This is where you will be staying from now on. Sit! From now on you will only speak and hear Japanese. You will call me Father and call her Mother. But.. what is this place? Uh this is... Can you speak Japanese? Yes... How old are you? Sixteen years old. How old are you? Fifteen. How old? Fourteen... Let me go! What are you doing? Where are you taking mel! I am only going to see if you have any diseases so stay still. Hey! Hey! If you keep moving you might get hurt. You guys may go back to your jobs now. A fourteen year old virgin. Nice... Hail to Great Japanese Emperor Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! I love it! Come sit here. It's okay. It's okay. Come here. Come here. Good! That's it. This is how a real girl should react. She certainly has the spirit worthy of being offered to The Great Imperial Army. Hey. Is that you? You asked me where we were, right? Why bother worrying over that? We are all dead already. This is hell. Are you okay? Are you? Where am I? Grandma? Where's Aeri? So you are okay. Thank god. You were in a deep sleep so Uncle ll-gyu brought you here. Do you remember anything at all? I don't remember a thing. I see. What are all these? They are.. They are called Gwe-bul-no-ri-gae, good luck charms. When I touch this I see soldiers and butterflies. Soldiers? What kind of soldiers? Soldiers with knives and guns? I think.. I saw the Gwe-bul-no-rio-gae you made in my dreams. - Yoshio. - Yes, sir. Hey Danaka. - Yes! - Yes? - Enemies! - It's an attack! Charge! Gol Go! Retreat! Kill them allll Kill! You filthy Korean Shit! What are you doing? I am going to make a wench wear this. You idiot. Who are these bastards? Now, now, there'll be a room open soon. Whatever.

Take a break for 10 minutes. No, I will get in trouble. It's because of this right? I will put the coupon here. To be honest... I came here because I was curious. but when I saw you, all those thoughts disappeared. Why? You look a lot like my sister. Many say that. Some say that I look like their mother. Really... That's probably because we are scared that may die at any moment. What's your name? Masako. No..not that name... What's your real name? I don't know. There's no time. Using Korean is banned. Brother, come here. Come down. Come here. Mr. Kuroda. You know she's insane. Please go easy on her. I will give you some special service later. so please let us women be alone for ten minutes. Please? Will there be any problems? You know how long I have been here. I assure you nothing will happen. Okay. Don't cause any trouble. Yes sir. You imbecile. You will be the death of me. What happened to her? She's a poor little thing. Why? One day another unit that her own brother was in, came to the station. Sunhee! Brother! Let me go! Brother! No! Brother! Brother!! Apparently, she calls every soldier she sees her 'brother' and gets all excited thinking they are her brother. That's too bad... Well, but isn't the weather great today? Nice and cool.
