[children playing] What the hell are you doing? Who the bloody hell is that who's just taken me money? It's me daughter. Leave her. She's a right cow. [children shouting] Hey man, cover yourself. Children live around here. Sorry, pal. Sodding bitch. What are you looking at? King girl. King girl. King girl. King girl. [theme music playing] Bloody bastard! Bloody bastard. [dogs barking] Don't take it, Glenn. It's for me lunch. You can easily afford it, Jenny. Just say you lost it, yeah? Stupid little cow. [school bell ringing] Morning, Mr. Wallingford. Morning, Kim. It's nice to see you back here. I was sorry to hear about your father. How's your mum? All right, I suppose. [Mr. Wallingford] And what about you? How are you coping? Oh, I'm okay. I'm fine. Okay, you lot. To your desks. Sir, are you gay, sir? [students laughing] What? It's just that you seem right sensitive, sir. You got an hard on, sir? [students laughing] What was that, Glenn? Oh, not much. Okay, settle down. I have something important to say to you all. It's nice to see that Gail Webb is back with us this morning. As some of you already know, Gail's father died last week after a short illness. Now I like to see this class as a small community. [students snickering] And I hope I can rely on each of you to show Gail the support she needs right now. Those of you who've lost a parent or anyone else close to you will know how she must be feeling and how your friendship and kindness can help her through this difficult time. [electronic music] Mum? Mum? [Pam] I'm up here, Gail. [sniffling] Sorry, it's just been a bit of a bad day. Mum, we did something at school about some kind of support group. It's all people who've had someone die in their family. I think if you ring 'em up, they might talk to you. I don't know how I'd have got through this without you. I haven't had much time for you, have I? I'll make you a cup of tea, shall I? Can we go out to eat? Yeah. Get some chips. [siren wailing] Don't sodding do that again. There's a name for what you do, you know? Yeah, it's called keeping us heads above water. You gonna take them trainers back to the shop, are ya? Telling me dad. He'll come back. [laughing] Think he gives a toss about any of us? You're not just a fat ugly cow. You're a stupid fat ugly cow. [door slams] [children shouting] What are you doing, Glenn? What are you looking at? Piss off, simpleton. Sniffing's more simple shared. Give it here. Stuff's got glue in it, dickhead. You'd learn things like that if you went to school. Hey, that's dangerous. [percussive instrumental music] There's a lass by a grave. What's she doing, burying herself? Talking. She's talking to the grave. I know her. Her dad's just died. This year, year nine will be joining year nine boys from next door, a prospect which will no doubt delight most of you if the horseplay in the streets is anything to go by. What's with these? I thought you'd guess, sir. It's to show respect like you said, sir. Her dad died, didn't he? That's very thoughtful of you girls. Now let's translate that into action, shall we? Take your ties off and sit down quietly and respectfully. For those of you just arrived, the choices for end of term activities this year are ice skating, which is three pounds 60 to include a coach, and 10 pin bowling, also three pounds 60. Those of you who can't afford either can have their ears tortured for free by school bands from both schools in our school hall. Money to Mrs. B. in the office. Glenn, Maxine, pay attention please. All right, register. One. Sir. -Two. -Here. -Three. -Sir. Four. -Five. -Sir. -[Gail grimaces] -Six. -Seven. -Here. -Eight. -Sir. -Nine. -Here, sir. -10. -Here sir. -11. -Here. -12. -Here, sir. -13. -Yep. 14. [girls laughing] [techno music] Better go now, dad. Be late for me tea. [crow cawing] [both moaning] [ominous music] You can piss off and all. You're a sad little leper, aren't ya? What kind of clothes are these? Did your mummy make 'em for ya? Spastic features. No tits. You're a lesbian, aren't ya? Give her one, Ayshe. [all laughing] You wanna fight, do ya? I'll tell. You know nothing. I want 10 quid tomorrow. You better bring it, you lesbian. You can piss off now, spider legs. Dead daddy. Dead daddy. Dead daddy. Dead daddy. [laughing] [country music] * And if you see your sister falling by the way * * Just stop and say * * You're going the wrong way * Hello, love. What's wrong? Nothing. [knocking] Emma-Louise, open the bloody door. We're here, mum. Well don't just bloody stand there, stupid. Open the sodding door. See? I told ya, Ruffles. Rafiq. Rafiq. [laughing] Come and help me out, Glenn. I'm not sure I can cope. Oh, have a bit of fun, lass. There's not bloody much of it about. [laughing] You all right? Yeah. Goodnight. Night, love. Sleep well. [door squeaking] [TV playing in background] How 'bout it, love? Piss off. If you do it like your mum, you'll like it. Isn't that right, love? You come anywhere near us and I'll slash your balls off. [Rafiq chuckles] No worries. [ethereal electronic music] [dogs barking] [birds chirping] School's all right. Going in early. Are you cold? I could bring you some clothes. Do you remember when we went camping to Spain? We couldn't really afford it. You taught me how to swim that year. You held me up in the water. You had a really tight hold on me. I don't feel safe without you, dad. Put your arms around me. Hold me tight. Don't suppose we'll go to Spain again. I have to go now. She'll be up soon. I don't wanna go but I'd better. I love you, dad. I really love you. [water running] [door banging] I believe you've got something for me. Speak up, spider legs. I can't get it. She hasn't got it. Stupid twat. I want that money tomorrow, right? And if you don't get it, I'm gonna kill your mother. And if you bunk off school, we'll come around your house and collect. Okay? [Gail grunts] Lesbian bitch. [door slams] You all right? No. [crying] [door slams] [Social worker] And they have been paying you to have sex with you. Who said that? I know. It's that black bloke done encourage ya, isn't it? Yeah, well I know what he's after. [Social Worker] Obviously we can't reveal who reported it. The thing is, Mrs. Masterson, if you are in any kind of difficulty-- Will we be put in care, Glenn? I don't know. You might. Oh, hello girls. Probably see you all again. [door shuts] Will we be put in care, mum? I don't sodding know, do I? They're all bloody wogs. And he calls himself a flaming christian. Hello. They're upstairs, love, titivating. You know my blue dress you liked? Yeah. Do you wanna buy it? I don't know. Ow. Sod off. How much? 10 quid. It cost 49.99. You'll look fantastic in it. Much better than me. I ain't got 10 quid. Well, how much you got? Six pound 70. That'll do. See ya. Bye. Bye, love. Tina? -Bye, Gail. -Get that stuff washed off your face this minute. You look like a bloody prostitute. [pensive electronic music] You've got what you want. Just leave me alone. Mum! Mum. What is it? Nothing. No. No, leave 'em. Don't give 'em away yet. It's only been a few weeks. Look, it's upsetting you. Just leave 'em for a bit. Why did you not let me see him when he were dead? Figured it'd upset you. Do you think he can see us? Do you think he knows what's happening to us? I like to think his spirit is out there, keeping an eye on us. [birds chirping] [children yelling] [grunting and moaning] 32. 32. 32. Gail. Oh, Gail? [students snickering] Yes, sir. I mean I'm here, sir. Sorry. Okay you lot, off you go. Gail, hang on a minute. Bitch. Twat. Stupid cow. You go, Glenn. How you doing? Are you coping okay? Yeah. Why? You don't seem quite yourself, Gail. And one or two of your teachers have mentioned that you're getting behind with your work. It's understandable given what's happened. Are there any of the woman teachers that you'd like to talk to? It's not a good age to lose your dad. He's not really gone. Sorry? I mean, he's out there somewhere, isn't he? You know, his spirit. Yeah. Gail? Gail, this is your father speaking to you from the other side. I just wanna know, is your mother shagging anyone else yet? [laughing] But he's not gone. He's out there somewhere. Yeah, I saw him in Burger King, shoving a big Double Whopper down his gob. She chats to him at the grave, you know. I'm telling you, she sits and sodding chats to him like she thinks he's still alive down there. Bloody psycho. [laughing] Let's dig him up. That should put shits up her. Sick bitch. [slow rock music] Your dad's back. Needs a bed, does he? Don't be like that, love. By hell, you're getting bigger. You'll make a footballer yet. Six pound. Don't you be so fucking cheeky. Don't know why I bother coming home when all I get is this. [Glenn] It's never gonna be for long, is it? [timber clattering] What are you doing, Glenn? [energetic percussive music] Don't do that. [crows cawing] [Glenn] Come on. Come on. [Paul] No, go on. Go on, go away. [Glenn] Supposed to be stiff, stupid. [Paul] I know, it's too cold. Why do you want to do it in the road? I know you don't fancy me. I want to have a baby. [Paul] You? [Glenn] Yeah, what's wrong with that? [Paul] Naught. Can I put me trousers back on now? Paul, do you think, you know, the big lads will ever fancy me? [Paul] Nay, you're too bossy. [Glenn] I'm not bloody bossy. [Gloria laughing] [siren wailing] * Gloria * * Come on Gloria * * Gloria * * Come on Gloria * * Gloria * You got a really big fat sexy arse, you have. [laughing] [ominous music] Ah Jesus, what a smell. Yuck, I feel sick. Oh god, hang him. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Good afternoon, girls. What's going on, why are they moved? They changed the places, sir. Oh, I see. Why? Hate the smell, sir. You can't stop the smell. The smell? Am I missing something here? Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Smelly fanny. Tina! Tina. Tina. Can't speak to you, Gail. If anyone in class speaks to you, King Girls will do 'em. Oh, god. Do I smell, Tina? Gotta go, Gail. Don't speak to me. [water running] ["Kung Fu Fighting" by Carl Douglas] Come on then, dance. Nah, I don't dance. Just move your bloody feet. Come on. Used to dance with you when you were a little lass. I know. I remember. You were a bonny little thing. Ordell! Ordell! Ordell! [chuckling] Wish you'd been a lad. Is that why you left? No. You always get the wrong idea, don't you? Why then? I don't know. I'm no good at it, families. Anyway, you always act like a lad, don't ya? You're still bonny, you know? Naught wrong with being a big lass, Glenn. You'd make a fine woman. [applauding] [crowd murmuring] ["The First Time Ever I saw Your Face" by Roberta Flack] * The first time * * Ever I saw your face * * I thought the sun * * Rose in your eyes * * And the moon * * And the stars * * Were the gift you gave * * To the dark * * And the endless skies * * And the first time * * Ever I kissed your mouth * * I felt the earth * * Move in my hands * * Like the trembling heart * [moaning and grunting] [Man] How much money you got on you? How much money you got? [Gloria] Oh, I've got nothing. [Man] You must have some money on you. What the hell you do all week? Can't you get out there and get some money? [Woman] You have to come to me to give you our money to give to, is it? [Man] Oh, you're doing it anyway, aren't ya? Jesus. [Gloria] Is that what you came back for? [Man] The hell am I coming back for? [Gloria] You bastard. You think I do it for pleasure? If you went out and got a job and give me some money, I wouldn't need to do it at all, you lousy bloody fucking bastard. [Man] Oh god, here we go. Get stuffed, will ya? Get out and get a bit of cash, will ya? Can I come in with you? [Man] Get off! Get off. [ominous music] [Gloria crying] Piss off. Where's me dad? He's pissed off. That social worker at school yesterday. Oh yeah. She were talking to one of Emma-Louise's teachers. That blag bastard. You better lay off for a bit. Don't sodding tell me what to do, you fat cow. Sod you. You'd be glad, wouldn't you? You'd be bloody glad if we were put in care. I'd be glad to see the back of your ugly face and that's for fucking sure. [door slams] Sod off. [energetic percussive music] [all laughing] What's going on? A present? That's nice. [paper crinkling] [students laughing] Who's responsible for this? Who has done this? [students laughing] Who has done this? It's not real, sir. They used ketchup. It's just a joke. A joke? Sick, that's what you lot are. Bloody sick. Who did it? It were Gail Webb, sir. [Student] Yeah, Gail Webb. Was it you, Gail? It weren't me, sir. I didn't do it. -[school bell ringing] -Don't anybody move. Sit down. Sit down. Right, Gail Webb stay behind. The rest of you, get out. Go on, get out. Was it you, Gail? Is it your writing? Who did it? Who did it? [books clattering] I'm lost, dad. I'm lost. Some really bad things are happening. [birds chirping] [crows cawing] I need some money. But I don't know where to get it from. Did I not love you enough? Is that why you've gone and left me on me own? Uncle Stan! Gail. Good to see you, Stan. Hey Pam, I'll do them for you. Oh, right. Gail, penny. Oh. [both chuckling] Right, move over, woman. Give a man tools to do the job. [laughing] You've hardly eaten anything. I'm not hungry. Gail, I know it's not the same as having your dad, love, but if you have any troubles or if you just want to talk to somebody, I'm always here. You know that, don't you? Uncle Stan. Oh, forgotten the plates. Well actually... I need some money for school stuff. I don't like to bother me mum just now. You're a good girl. Buy yourself something new. Thanks, Uncle Stan. Bye, Pam. -Take care. -Bye, love. I know it were you. I know what you want, you bastard. You want to keep your gob shut, you nosy bastard. Who the hell do you think you are? You bloody black bastard. [ethereal music] And where the hell are you going? Come on, love, let's go. * Hush little baby * * Don't say a word * * Mum's gonna buy you a mockingbird * * If that mockingbird don't sing * * Mumma's gonna buy you a diamond ring * * If that diamond ring don't shine * * Surely gonna break this heart of mine * * Hush little baby * * Don't say a word * * Mumma's gonna buy you a mockingbird * * If that mockingbird won't sing * * Mumma's gonna buy * [ethereal music] [dog barking] Glenn! Glenn! Mum won't wake up. She won't wake up. Mum. [static crackling on radio] Are you two gonna be all right? Yeah, we'll be fine. [engine starting] [siren wailing] Will she be all right? Yeah. They pump your stomach out. We should've gone with her. They'd just start nosing. Will dad come back now? [crying] [doorbell buzzing] I saw the ambulance. Is she okay? It's not serious. She'll be all right. You two on your own? Nah, me mum's sister's coming over. Look, I'm sorry about me husband, but we've got a little girl. You won't tell him she's gone to hospital, will ya? No, all right. I'm just ringing to see how Gloria Masterson is. She were admitted last night. No, I'm just a friend. I'm a really close friend though. No, all right. They won't tell you naught if you don't give a name. You're a bit slow this morning. You're gonna be late. Not like you. [energetic percussive music] [students shouting] [Gail shrieks] [head thuds on pavement] You're gonna die. Just like your dad. I want 50 quid tomorrow. Who did this? Who did this? [Teacher] Have you got a boyfriend? No. Well what about hobbies? Clothes, music. Do you go out much? A bit. Look, Gail, I'm going to say this for your own good. But maybe if you took an interest in what's fashionable, you might stand out less. You know yourself, if you're unusual in any way you're a prime target for bullying. I don't think that's-- Of course we'll do everything we can but we can't be with you every minute of the day. Now, there are strategies you can use to help yourself. Try to avoid the places they get you in. The toilets, for instance. And try not to be on your own too much. And most important, act confidently. Don't let them see they're getting to you. Yeah. I'll pass this on to Mr. Healy. He'll deal with the girls concerned. They won't know it were me who told, will they? Not if you don't want them to. Your father died recently, didn't he? Yeah. I was just wondering whether you might be feeling a little bit sensitive at the moment. Do you think it's big to go around threatening and frightening smaller girls with your pals to back you up? Does it make you feel good? 'Cause if it does, that doesn't place you very high on the evolutionary ladder, does it, Glenn? This girl has just lost her father. If it was your dad who had just died, how would you feel? Wouldn't give a toss. I've just got one thing to say to you. If I have one more report of you bullying any child in this school, I'm going to suspend you. -[phone ringing] -Do you understand? And I'll do my personal best to make sure you don't come back. A week's lunchtime detentions. Are you all right, Glenn? Why don't you come in and join us? Suit yourself. [glass shattering] [bell ringing] [energetic percussive music] I know where you fuck off, slag. Dead daddy, dead daddy. Let's kidnap her and torture her. Where's Healy now, eh, Gail? [door slamming] Better get that money, you slag. Come on. [all clamouring] Woo! [laughing] [ominous music] [Pam] Gail, will you put this rubbish in the bin for me? [Gail] I'm doing me homework. I'm sick and tired of this. I cannot do it all on me own, you know? Now you just go and take that bloody rubbish into the bin. You're stupid! You're stupid. It's all your fault. It's your fault dad died. Everything's your fucking fault. Don't you speak to me like that. Go on, hit me. Hit me. I'm useless. I'm nothing. -Go on, hit me. -Stop it. -Stop it. -I'm just a piece of shit. Stop this. Just stop it. Just calm down. Calm down. Just calm down. This isn't just about your dad, is it? Is it trouble at school? Sorta, yeah. It's some lasses. They've been pestering me a bit. What do you mean pestering? Oh, you know, they've been picking on me. Teasing me about... About what? [crying] Lots of things. They're outside. Outside, they're outside this house? No mum, don't let 'em see you. You're really scared. Mum, don't go out. Hey, haven't you lot got homes to go to? Why, you offering us yours? Now, don't be so cheeky you. Now, you lot just clear off and leave my daughter alone or I'll have the police on you. I dread to think what kind of homes you lot come from. Sod off, you stupid old cow. [Emma-Louise] Glenn. Cheeky bitch. Go on with you. You're just rubbish, you. Get back to that council estate where you belong. Just leave decent people alone. Who the fuck do you think you are? Glenn, come on, let's go. She'll just call the police. I'm gonna do you. I'm gonna put you under. Glenn. [Pam sighs] Well, they seem to be going. They'll only take it out on me at school. [knocking] What's up with her? She took tablets. Oh, she done that caper, has she? You coming home? I think they might put Emma-Louise in care, stand out on us own. I'll be over at the weekend, hey. You'll be all right. Big lass like you? If social services come round, send 'em bloody packing. We haven't got any money for food. Running out of water. Your big sister could sort that out if she put her mind to it. Women can always make money. You what? I'm only joking. There, that'll do you. One pound 27. Bastard! [coins clattering] [door creaks] [dog barking] [ethereal music] [car horn beeping] What you looking at? Sod off. Christ almighty, you're a bit of a dog, aren't ya? Still, you're only young. How much? What do you think you are, sodding Van Damme? Have you looked at yourself, you fat bastard? Listen, love, I'm not trying to flog it. Wouldn't go you if you were paying sodding gold bars, you dumb bastard. Bastard! Bastard! Bastard. I'm a virgin. You all like young virgins, don't ya? I'm a virgin. Nobody's ever bloody touched me. [car horn beeping] I'll lock it. [engine revving] [ominous music] [window clattering] [energetic percussive music] Your dad's dead. He's never coming back. Bitch! You've been in me house. You took his clothes. Fucking bitch. I'll kill ya. Me leg, I think I broke me leg. Bitch! I'll kill ya. Why, why do you do it? -Help me. -Why? Tell me why. I don't know, because I can. I watched you trying to shag that little lad. I heard everything you said. You wanted him to give you a baby. You're not as hard as you make out. So come on, tell me why. Why have you been doing this to me? Because I'm jealous. [Gail] Of what? Of your life, of your dad. Me dad's dead. But he cared about you. I've heard you talking to him. [crying] He loved you. Give me his coat. Bye, Glenn. [Glenn crying] Where have you been? The grave. In the dark? You all right? I miss him so much, mum. I miss him so much. Yes, I know, love. So do I. You cry, sweetheart. It's time. [Gail crying] [patients murmuring] How are ya? Rough. How did you do that? Fell down a black hole. You daft cow. We didn't come 'cause we were scared of social workers. Wanna cuss at what me dad said? Yeah, I suppose. That and everything else. He's a right bastard, mum. I know. He weren't our loss, though. He's not worth shite. We're better off without him. When you out? Tomorrow. Emma-Louise will be glad. [theme music]
