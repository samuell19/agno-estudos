If anything's missing, please give us a call. - Thank you. - Sure. Yeon-soo. It's over, you're safe. When will you be home? I'm really scared. I told you, I'm in 2015.

Yeah, a black Carnival. 6782232. 6782232... He's the one! I'll hang up for a bit to look up the plate. We can catch the invader. Call me back in a few, don't worry.

Real slow. Say what? Yeah, 6782232, what is it? Carnival plate. Mackerel, I know you're hurting, but let's stop this. Stop what? Your wife died a long time ago, you got to move on. What do you mean? I just spoke to her. Wow, my friend has gone full crazy. Moron, she died a year ago! What? 7 AM, body found. She's... dead... So, your husband from the future called and warned you about the robbery? And the robber really did show up? Yes. Wow... Can you reach him now? Honey. Get out of the house, it's not over yet. It may not be a simple home invasion. The perpetrator may be following you. Honey, a detective is with me. You can speak to him. Evening, are you the husband? Detective, my wife cannot be home, she'll be killed there. What? Black carnival, 6782232. He's trying to kill her. Who is that? I don't know, I'm looking it up. I'll look it up, where are you now? Detective, it's a bit complicated, but I'm in 2015 right now. Is that so? So, Mr. Dong-ho KOH is in 2015, and the driver of 6782232 is trying to kill your wife. Did I get that right? Yes! It may sound crazy, but that's the situation! In any case, please protect her. Hello? Detective? He hung up. I should ask for a winning lotto number. Shall we go inside? Wait... How did you know his name? I think you said it. Shall we go inside? The caller you're trying to reach is currently not available. Sir, you should go home You must've been startled. Come here please, walk me through it. Don't detectives work in pairs?

It's 'chief' to you, asshole. Chief. Find me someone. Who is it, boss? I mean, chief. He took off without paying. You're getting on my nerve, could you go sit down?

Evening, chief. - What about CCTV? - We're verifying it now. Why isn't the scene secured? It's like an open market here. The car's already busted! What an idiot. - Fix that. - Okay. Buncha amateurs. - What's this? - KOH used this... That man's crossing the line, crowd control! KOH this, KOH that, it's all gone to shit. - Chief. - What is it? He's a witness.

Metropolitan Homicide, chief Suk-ho SON. Rough day today. Why did a wanted man walk into a police station? Well... he... wanted to charge his cell phone. - Right? - Yes. He really did come here for a charge. Are you messing with me? A murder suspect walks in and asks to charge his phone? He must be an idiot. Chief, we got a situation. He had an illegal air gun in his car. I'm sorry. East Seoul, Goduk district 11-9, Jae-hyun DOE How much? Let's see... the vehicle contained an illegal air rifle, and KOH is considered armed and dangerous. Citation for Bravery Gangnam Police This is a crime scene! Mister! You can't go inside!

If anything's out of ordinary, please let us know. Thanks for your cooperation. You see? I knew you'd come around. Where's your boss? I told you, he's busy with the burning man incident. I got you a list, just give them a scare. Yo, gangster! Dong-ho KOH was at my place! So? What do we do? - Gotta catch him. - And then? Get the dash cam back! I have to? Why? Listen. Election's around the corner, I got no one to spare. Watch that tone. Did your boss order this? Order what? Call me if you don't want the job, so I can hire someone else. - Stop. - What? What is it? Call me 'chief', asshole. Shouldn't have gotten your ass fired then. Hello. - Thanks for meeting us. - I'm Gyu-su KIM. Afternoon. I haven't talked to him in a year, so I don't know how to reach him. Not even a clue as to his where abouts? If I knew, I'd convince him to turn himself in. So we can defend him. Not legally, - but as a friend. - Well... Chief, he's not someone who's capable of killing. There's not even a solid motive. So you're saying he may not be the killer. What I think isn't important. Where is Ms. Hye-Jin KIM? She went to Daehan Gateon an assignment, should I call? No, we'll give her a call. Okay. - Let's head out. - Sure. Oh, wait. Who's taking care of his daughter? - She's with us. - I see.

You call me in a year to ask me about my dinner? What? Did you really kill her? Sweetie... I didn't do it, don't you trust me? Why? - Why did you do it? - Don't believe them. Bad people are framing me for everything. So why run away without a word? Why are you hiding? Don't cry, sweetie. I'll turn everything back to as they were. - Once I find the killer... - It's too convenient. If you say that, should I believe you? That's not it, I talked to mom... Forget it. You're all talk. Don't call me again. Kyung-rim? Sweetie! Saturday, May 16 The thing about KOH is, no one ever talks bad about him. Why'd a guy like him kill his wife? Dong-ho KOH is currently near Daehan Gate. Turn the car around! Daehan Gate! We're en route there, to meet Ms. KIM. Then step on it, moron! Yes, sir! Dong-ho KOH is currently near Daehan Gate. Requesting visual confirmation.

Moving to Namdaemun. Heavy traffic due to lantern parade. The entire uptown is blocked. What a mess. Where you going? Park it somewhere and join me. What? Chief! Requesting backup at Jongro-2. Unable to move due to crowd. Spread out to the temple! What are you doing?! Just look straight. Where did you get this? - Jae-hyun DOE. - Who's that? Yeon-sods killer. What are you talking about? I lost this months ago! Don't play dumb! You said to open it on my b-day, it was gone way before then! You didn't sell it off? Why'd I do that'?! We had no witness, so we had to settle. What do you mean? TY Construction, illegal union inspection! Don't you remember? This is Se-moon PARK, he's tied to the burning man case. Se-moon PARK... Se-moon PARK... Yeah, that's him. Do you have the video file? We can get a retrial with the video. This is TY Construction boss, he's assaulting a union member. Send the video to my place. My place... This is why she was... Hey! KOH! Dong-ho KOH! Converge units at Chunggye! Dong-ho KOH! He's in the parade! Hurry! - He left! - Come here! Move in! KOH, you bastard! - Out of my way! - He's right there! Who's at Chunggye? Dong-ho KOH! Get him! He's on the run Get the bicycle! Suspect is on a bike, heading towards Chunggye. Have the checkpoint ready. All units near Chunggye, be advised. Stop that bike! Cut him off! Stop right there! Stop! Dong-ho KOH! That's enough! Get the bike! Hey! Out of my way! Stop! Stop right there! Stop him! Stop! Stop! You son of a bitch! Go after him! He's on foot! - Converge on the bridge! - Block him! Dong-ho KOH! Block the street! Freeze! After him! Don't move! Don't just stand there! Check the other side too! Chief! What is it? Hey, come here! Do you see anything? It's much too dark. Cleared to use deadly force. The suspect is carrying a rifle. I repeat, use of deadly force is permitted... Honey? Are you okay? I was worried. That detective... He's the perp. I know, where are you? At the hospital. What should I do now? Listen to me very carefully. Was there a delivery for me? - Nothing. - Think carefully. It's really important. Honey? What was that? - Dong-ho KOH? - Are you okay? You're him. - Honey, answer me! - How did you find my place? What's going on? You gave me a jolt. Honey? Hello?! While we were searching in Chunggye... I don't believe this. I'm sorry. Are you on a picnic? Go find him! Please, what's going on? Honey, please answer me! Are you okay? Can you hear me? What's going on? Mrs. KOH? It really is you. It doesn't make sense, but it does. Who are you? Why are you doing this? Yeah, you really are you. Been a while, should I get you lotto numbers? That's enough, you bastard! Why did you kill her? Can you shoot me? Killing isn't for everyone. You should've cocked it first. She was in the wrong place. Where is the envelope? Where is it? Freeze. Buddy boy, let him go. Who are you? Buddy! Untie him, asshole. So why stir up a hornet's nest? Buddy! Uljiro back alley, 178 cm tall, Grey jacket, and a hat. He's nearby, look around. Hey! Stop! KOH, where are you going? I... didn't kill my wife. You saw him, he's a cop named Jae-hyun DOE... Fine, I'll catch you both. Here. He was hired by Se-moon PARK to retrieve incriminating evidence, and killed her for it. Fine, so drop your gun. You don't believe me. My job is to arrest you, not believe you. You've been warned. Drop it, before you regret it. I'm doing this so I don't regret. First shot is a warning. Second shot is not, understand? Chief! Where are you! - No! - What the hell?! - Don't shoot my dad! - Get out of the way! Sir! Please! I'm sorry! My dad didn't do it! The killer is someone else! Please don't do this! Let him go! - Hurry! - Over here! It doesn't fit! Lower your arms, look at the screen. Who is it? Holy cow! Se-moon PARK You really don't know him? How can I know someone I never met? Dong-ho KOH named you. So? Mr. PARK. How about this? It's a bit blurry, so I wonder if you'll make it out. Take a close look. My sight isn't great... What is it of? Right? KOH lied to us about having the originals. A council candidate like you wouldn't do this. Let's call it a day, I have a busy day tomorrow. Sure, we'll call you later. Once was enough. What a fuck nut. It's been a while. Not for me, I see your election flyers everyday. Jae-hyun, it's the last time. Let's get KOH, before the cops. No, they saw my face. What's this? Su-jung's 10 now, isn't she'? Does she still want to be a cop? Not another word. Does she know her daddy gets paid to kill people? What did you say, you fuck?! Is he fucking nuts? Get off of him! What's with you! Jae-hyun, tell Su-Jung to study hard. You need to watch her grow up. Don't touch that, it's not done! Coffee. Black. Thank you. It's okay. Look at your face, you're a walking dead. - Missy. - What? Watching Kyung-rim cry, I wondered if I'm a good father. Idiot, you're trying really hard. - Me? - Yeah. Think about it. Brought up in a poor family, you got the top lawyer prize. So you're either a bad mofo, or lived to your fullest. I lobbied for that prize. Really? You're a bad mofo! Humans are all the same. The thing about this phone is, the police locked it up, so just swapping a chip won't do. How about using a burner? I'll give it to you for cheap. Just fix it, no matter what. Son of a bitch... No matter what I do, it'll never work! It's working... Yeon-soo? Are you alright? Was it that cop? Yeah, it was him. He even framed me for killing you. What? What'll you do then? Honey, a weird envelope did come in the afternoon. It had a fish drawing on it. Fish... It's because of that envelope. Then I'll go look for it. No, nothings changed, it's still dangerous. There's no other way. I'll wait outside until you get home. The knife... I have the cop's knife. The knife? This will at least clear your name. I'll hide it in the exam room, come get it. Where will you hide it? Somewhere no one will find it in a year. I'm in a meeting... Yes, one moment, please. Group's reputation is sliding... What the hell have you been doing? I need a favor. It'll be sorted out soon, so take care of Kyung-rim till then. Of course I'll look out for her. Wait, what's there to sort out? Gotta find her killer, evidence is at the hospital. It's all over when I have that. Evidence? What evidence? The hospital where she worked? Don't you worry about it. Just look after her. Yeon-soo, I'm going in. SCH University Hospital How will we find him at this rate? I'm here. Room #415, right? Yeah. Hyuk-kae KWON... He always worked with you? Yeah, why? Didn't this bastard hit on your in college? That bitch... Now isn't the time! Stay on topic. Find it'? Yeah, I got it. So it's all over? Yeah, everything will be fine. I put you through so much. You had a big day too. You were great, Mr. KOH. Honey, is it raining there too? It rained on the day you proposed to me. Do you remember? You don't remember? Of course I do. The cable car broke down, and you cried in fear. I felt so safe when you held my hand. Remember what you said to me? Of course. Tell me. I... protect... What? I will protect you forever, so just trust me. Honey? Honey? I trust the mackerel, I love you. I told you can't shoot. Shall we find out? Don't fret, you're born with the skill. Hey. Don't fret, you can't acquire that skill. Son of a bitch! Remember this? You're finished. Oh yeah, I saw a staircase back there. Yo, Jae-hyun DOE. Shit, how about that knife? Fuck your 'chief shit. Boss, the mackerel is on the run. Yes, I'll clean up this mess. Okay. - Kyung-rim, not asleep yet? - I can't fall asleep. Since you're not in bed, dad must be out late again. He's terrible. No, he cares so much about you and me. Taking his side? Sweetie. I'm sorry I nag. No, I'm the one sorry. I know I shouldn't, but I can't control myself. My baby's all grown up. I didn't know. I miss you already. I'm getting goose bumps. I want my mom back. Go to bed, I'll scold dad tomorrow. Good night! See you tomorrow! Yeah, see you tomorrow. Good night... Why isn't she moving? Wait, 3367! Boss! 3367 is heading for Seocho! Chief! This knife was found on the scene. Doe got his restaurant from Se-moon PARK. Hello? Honey? How bad was the crash? If you can't drive, take the subway. Honey! That detective is in front of the house. Why'd a detective be at our house now? What're you talking about? Forget it! Forget it! I'm in a cab, almost home, let's talk later. Are you... in 2014? Were you asleep? Of course it's 2014. Where are you? I'm come to you. Coming to greet me? It's not like you. I've been waiting for you, I'm near the main street. Hold on a sec. No, no, I'll get off. I'm at the main street, where are you? Too many cars here. Which one is it? Hold on, what's with you today? - How much? - $19.50 please. That much? Where are you? Don't rush me, I'm paying. I just got off, where are you? Honey? Where are you? Where are you? Yeon-soo! Thank you. Should I stay with you? It's okay, I'm a big girl. Thanks again. - Hello? - Dad! There's a man here! Hello? Kyung-rim! Hey, it's me. I took the staircase. You bastard! Don't you dare touch her! I wanted to corner you too. You asshole! Don't touch her! Where are you?! Your place. Bring the knife. It's okay, it'll be over soon. Your dad's coming. How'll this go down? You'll resolve this? You said you just wanted the original file. I can't believe I'm doing this for money... How'll you keep everyone quiet? Too many are involved. So damn yappy. Just need to shut one more up. Hey. Kids are the best for driving people mad. Let her go, this is between us. Give me the knife. Where's the video? The Se-moon's PARK original video. 2nd floor, it's in the study. My husband will find you. Your hubby is the killer. Keep your word, let her go. Sweetie! You okay? I'm sorry I didn't believe you. - I thought you were... - It's okay, sweetie. Let her go. Sweetie... - Kyung-rim! - Dad! Sweetie... Get out of here! Go! Stop, please stop. Don't... Don't do it... She saw my face. Yeon-soo! Yeon-soo! Yeon-soo! Yeon-soo... - Bye! - See ya! - Bye! - See ya! Did you black out again? You should sleep in bed. Kyung-rim! You okay? You reek. I'm sorry. At least you know. Right, Sarang? Go wash up, you're setting a good example for her. Honey! What's with you? Go wash up, you stink. How much did you drink? Shouldn't you get ready for school? It's too early, let me play with her. You made a promise for getting the puppy. 10 more minutes, I'll wash up afterwards.
