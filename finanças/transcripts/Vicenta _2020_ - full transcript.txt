GUERNICA, BUENOS AIRES PROVINCE JULY 2006 CEPA CINE presents With the support of the INCAA and the ALTER-CINÉ Foundation A documentary by Darío Doria How long does a day last, Vicenta? When does it end? All those hours in someone else’s house: cleaning what has to be cleaned, washing what has to be washed, ironing what has to be ironed, cooking and taking care of someone else’s children… A job that doesn’t diminish once you get home, because at home you also clean, wash and cook. And even though Valeria, your older daughter, is already living alone with her husband, with your little grandson, here’s Laura, who grows up and doesn’t. Developmental delay, fixation on childhood… Laura is already 19, but she grows up and doesn’t, that’s what’s going on. Today Laura can’t sleep, she has a stomach ache. And if she doesn’t sleep you don’t sleep, and if no one sleeps, Vicenta, even if there’s a night, the day hasn’t ended yet… And in “Saludarnos” we’re going to talk about the importance of sports and physical activity on children. And as always, we will have cooking classes with Diana Boudrian, with dishes, with tasty, cheap and very healthy recipes. This Monday we continue to take care of everybody’s health. “Saludarnos,” Mondays to Fridays, 10 a. m. Watch Channel 7. A doctor examines Laura and tells you something no one expected: Laura is pregnant. It’s been like that for 14 weeks, 14 weeks and you didn’t know. How many things can you think of the second everything changes? Now the doctor says that if you file a report for abuse and she’s taken to the San Martín hospital, perhaps you’ll be allowed to have an abortion. He says there’s a law, that’s what the doctor says. And you listen, yes, but how many decisions can you make the second everything changes? You’d like to hug that daughter of yours, who grows up and doesn’t, and remain there, both of you. But you cannot stay put. You have to talk, ask, you have to understand. That is why you tell your daughter how it is that a woman can become pregnant. You look for some good words to tell her, and you see Laura’s eyes as they open wide. And then she tells you, and you listen, without wanting to know that the one who did that to her was Uncle Luis. This morning, Valeria, your older daughter, decides to skip work and join you. If only you knew how to read and write, Vicenta, everything would be different. Perhaps this help wouldn’t be needed. But you don’t know, and Valeria does. She also knows that from that father who didn’t love you, who was so violent with you in many ways, from that father who left, Uncle Luis’ brother-in-law, she wants nothing. Not even the last name. The three of them are in this together, that is what Valeria knows. The policeman takes your statement, and words go from the air to the computer, from the computer to the paper, shapeless words that extend, flat as they are, with an instruction: to go to La Plata in order to start the judicial proceedings. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT INFORMATION District Attorney’s Office No. 5 Principal “On June 24, 2006, Mrs. VDA, mother of LMR, files a report in order to start criminal action within the terms of article 72, section 1 of the Penal Code, expressing that her mentally challenged 19-year-old daughter has been the victim of sexual abuse. At the time of formulating those criminal charges, the plaintiff states the following, “…I just want to know if it is possible to terminate this pregnancy, given that, due to her disability, my daughter is not able to bring a child to the world, and neither me nor my other daughter are able to take care of the unborn baby. ” The following weeks will consist of coming and going to the courthouse: to Laura, it means to skip school, to you and Valeria, it means to skip work. Coming and going, coming and going, once and a thousand times. Everyday life also changes for Valeria’s husband. While you come and go to court, he takes care of the little child, of the house, he awaits them every night with the food ready. And whenever he can, with the car service he drives those 100 kilometers to La Plata’s courthouse. Coming and going with you, he also does that. The judicial machine moves at its own pace. It has no hurry. From office to office, from hand to hand, the file reaches the hands of a social worker who reads your request: Laura needs an abortion. And then she sends it, one of many, to the Minors’ Counselling Office. Minors’ Counsellor Official Family Defender “The case falls under article 86, section 2 of the Penal Code: ‘An abortion performed by a qualified doctor is not punishable if the pregnancy comes from rape or from sexual assault inflicted on an idiot or insane woman. In this case, the consent of her legal agent will be required in order to perform the abortion…’” From office to office, from hand to hand, the file is now in the hands of the General Defender, who has to accompany your family, Vicenta, until your request is fulfilled. He needs your authorization in order to arrange the termination of Laura’s pregnancy. And you give your authorization, of course, because that’s what you have always asked for. But it seems like it’s not enough, no. Because now, at the San Martín Hospital, the chief of gynecology says it’s more complex, that it’s not that easy, that we have to check with the hospital’s Director, with the team of professionals, with the bioethics committee, and wait. Coming and going, coming and going once and a thousand times more. Days go by, on and on, and there is so much to do. How many permits have to be requested? When does it all end, Vicenta? When? The hospital authorities, the doctors, the bioethics committee, all of them gather. They are now discussing whether they authorize the abortion you requested or not. Meanwhile, pre-surgical studies, blood tests, electrocardiogram, sonogram. Medical routine to them. Bathrobe, fear, admittance for your Laura. And when everything seems on track, the district attorney who should be investigating Laura’s rape, the one who should be investigating, finds out the abortion is about to be performed and Xeroxes the file. Why? What for? Oh, Vicenta… Oh… And with urgency -her own urgency- she sends it to a Juvenile Court judge. And the judge says things, this things: that the investigation for the abuse Laura suffered is ongoing, that that rape hasn’t been proved yet, and also, that the degree of your daughter’s disability hasn’t been proven yet. That perhaps she’s not that disabled. That we’ll have to see. That’s what she says, and sends a notification to the hospital so that no one moves, so that nothing moves, so that every medical procedure is interrupted, that’s what she says. The minors’ counsellor complains. She tells the judge to abstain, because what’s been asked for, what you asked for, Vicenta, is contemplated and allowed in the Penal Code. Because the law says that no legal authorization is needed for what you asked for. But the judge won’t listen to her: she won’t listen, and she also decides to begin criminal action, just in case, invoking “the rights of the unborn child. ” The judge says that “an unjust aggression cannot be mended with another unjust aggression. ” And that is why she forbids any abortive medical practice and orders Laura and you to show up once a month at her court with a pregnancy control certificate, and, while she’s at it, Vicenta, she recommends you give the baby up for adoption. The Minors’ Counsellor appeals the ruling. And now Laura has to go through psychological and psychiatric tests until the Court’s psychology expert confirms what you already know, what everyone knows: that Laura grows up and doesn’t. But she puts it this way: "The IQ and psychosocial maturity of the minor are equivalent to those of an 8-year-old child. ” Civil Court of Appeals “…given that every child has an intrinsic right to live, and that a child is defined as any human being from the moment of their conception until they are 18 years of age, this court has resolved to reject the appeal filed, and, as a result of that, it orders that the control over the minor is maximized, and that the health of both the mother and the unborn child is supervised in a constant and direct fashion. ” Your family’s official defender appeals, again, this time before the Supreme Court of Justice. But first, the Court members send the file to the province’s Attorney General so that she gives her opinion. More names, more instances, more time that goes by. And in the middle there’s you, having lost your jobs due to your multiple absences. And now, in order to save the money you don’t have, you sleep near the courthouse. Luckily, there are more voices. Walking the courthouse’s hallways, a journalist finds out about your situation, about Laura’s situation, and makes it public. He tells it the way many stories are told, but this piece of news starts to spread. More and more and more. We’re going to change the subject, where going to go to La Plata, with the case of a disabled girl who was raped, the subject of abortion, the controversy. Patricia Molina is there. Go ahead, Patricia. Marcelo, this is a very delicate subject that has gained repercussion not only in this province but also in the entire nation. Yesterday, and by request of the judges, the opinion of the province’s Attorney General on this case became public. And right now, Buenos Aires’ Supreme Court is analyzing it. A case that could be deemed as historic. The nine members must decide if they authorize the termination of the pregnancy of this mentally challenged girl who was supposedly raped by his own uncle or not. Let’s remember that a few weeks ago, this girl was about to have an abortion at the San Martín hospital in La Plata; the doctors referred to article 86, section 2 of the Penal Code, which establishes the legality of abortions in case of rape of an insane or idiot woman, but two hours before the medical procedure a Juvenile Court judge, acting ex-officio and with little information on the girl and their family, stopped the abortion. She didn’t know the girl was mentally disabled or that she had been raped. Let’s hear the judge: “Of this abuse I did not take notice, I don’t know why… Well, I wasn’t notified of this abuse. I asked the San Martín hospital to inform me what the minor’s mental state is. That report was never answered, and the following the day, the minor and her mother showed up at the hospital. ” The judged received lots of criticism from ministers and attorneys. Meanwhile, the judge denies having stopped the abortion for religious reasons. “I never based my ruling on any religious conviction, no matter what this conviction is. ” Pro-choice organizations organize women’s rights demonstrations, and warn that time is running out. Meanwhile, the church is shocked by this girl’s case, and through Monsignor Casaretto, stated that abortion is wrong in any circumstance, and proposed the child be given up for adoption as a possible solution. Meanwhile, the family awaits the upcoming sentence of the province’s Court. Supreme Court of Justice Judge Genoud “…Previous to any kind of solution, this Court decided to interview the minor. From that interview, I am convinced of the disability she suffers, as well as the fact that she cannot assume any responsibility except for very simple tasks, not even having the ability to clean herself up. She is a person in constant need of her mother who cannot comprehend the fact that she is pregnant. For this hearing we have also come into contact with her mother, who, being lucid and fully aware of the adverse situation they are going through, gives the consent required by the guidelines for the abortion to come into effect. She is the one who knows her daughter best, because they both live together. She takes care of her, she bathes her, she made sure she attended a special needs school. It must be said that she is the person who is most qualified to know what is more beneficial to the young woman during these hard times that further complicate her already problematic situation. Finally, and centering on article 86, section 2 of the Penal Code, there is no evidence that would allow us to assume that judicial authorization is needed for the health professionals to do what, to their best knowledge, must be done. There has been an excess of judicial intervention. There is no loophole in the norm that allows to conclude that a judge may or may not authorize or prohibit said conduct. ” Judge Pettigiani “I cannot cease to mention the conclusions drawn from the hearing in which I have had the chance of getting to know the minor. I found a teenager with a noticeable mental retardation in regards to her actual age, who, to my perception, did not show any signs of haste or distress, irradiating a joyful, innocent, kind presence. I did not notice she was aware of her pregnancy, and even though it is clear that she will have difficulties in carrying out her role as a mother, I don’t find her incapable of providing affection to her child and finding, in motherhood, a motivational event that will allow her to acquire a certain maturity in her personality, due to which I consider that, properly assisted the unborn could grow up in a nice family environment. In the interview, the child was also present, even though I couldn’t get to meet them. In order to come into contact with them, I have asked the Superior Court I am part of for an urgent ultrasound of the minor, LMR, in regards to her pregnancy. Sadly, that request was rejected by most members of this Court. The aim of that measure was for the ministers of this Superior Court to come get to know and come into contact with the little body of the unborn child before giving out the sentence. By making this possible, we could have recognized a right provided by Argentina’s legal system to the unborn child: the right for the child to be heard and paid attention to in any way. ” An old struggle you didn’t choose chooses you as its center during these days. You, Laura, Valeria. . Voices in favor, voices against, beliefs, convictions, and you in the eye of the storm. It is a center you did not choose, but from which you cannot move at the moment, because a decision is required, a word that will allow or prohibit. It won’t be long, Vicenta, it won’t be long. Buenos Aires’ Supreme Court of Justice has authorized the abortion of a disabled girl who was raped. Six judges voted in favor, three voted against, it was a divided ruling, but also a historic one. In any case, there was a ruling yesterday for the abortion to be performed… Actually, it was left to the doctors… the decision… The conclusion would be: let the doctors solve it. Buenos Aires’ Supreme Court did not ban the abortion. In a ruling of six votes against three. However, the Ministry of Health of the Province of Buenos Aires said that before subjecting a disabled girl to an abortion, they are waiting for the correspondent notification of the Court. When the authorization from Court for the practice you’re all aware of arrives, we will act accordingly. The hospital’s staff is prepared to act accordingly. A ruling that is not quite clear, because according to a member of the High Court, it’s the doctors who must decide if they perform the abortion or not. Look, if the ruling still stands, the doctors will have to decide. And we must see if the doctors are willing to perform it without the father’s consent. That’s the other issue. If it’s performed without the proper consent, the doctor may get into trouble. Judge Federico Domínguez, who voted against, explained his stance, because the rape hasn’t been proven. To me it’s not enough, because the defendant asks for a DNA test, and I think that if I ask for a DNA test, it’s because I did not rape you. That’s it to me. Ricardo de la Torre is dean at the Catholic University of La Plata. Yesterday, he showed up at the hospital with a notary to warn about the legal consequences the doctors would suffer if they terminated the pregnancy. Different political and judicial sources from the Buenos Aires province pointed out that they will everything within their reach in order for this woman to be operated tomorrow, and in order to safeguard the intimacy and security of this disabled girl, the place where the abortion will take place will be kept secret. Laura, inside, with a lot of people, with the fear that comes from not understanding what is going on, with the angst of not being with her mother. And you, outside, with the same fear, the same angst, but on the other side. Valeria and you, forced to remain outside and wait while others decide about Laura’s life, about your lives. María, good evening. A tough choice that arrived late, at least that is the opinion of the family, because earlier today there was a lot of expectation. A meeting that went on for two hours, with the doubt, the corresponding tests, but the doctors decided against it. Why? Because too much time had passed, and that’s why they chose to do it this way, because it was no longer about the article 86 contemplated in the penal code that says an abortion in unpunishable; it was going to be a delivery, so they made this decision: the pregnancy will continue. The entire family was notified, and they explained it this way: “At this point, it is absolutely impossible to perform an abortion, so we have notified the girl’s relatives about the fact that the pregnancy will continue and that the executive branch of the Buenos Aires province will provide not only medical help, but also all assistance necessary regarding support in the face of what’s coming, which is that she will continue with her pregnancy. The mother-to-be’s initials are LMR. Her life has always been different, she lives in her own world and her mentality has stayed in her childhood forever. She doesn’t understand that a court ruling wasn’t fulfilled. The doctors’ decision is the corollary to the judicial delays regarding this case, which now force a young disabled woman to carry on with a pregnancy that from a psychological perspective can only mean torture for her, given that it’s not only an undesired pregnancy, but also a repudiated one. It’s like the concretion of the usurpation, of the invasion of her body in a non-consensual manner. It is the presence of the perpetrator within her. Luckily, there are other voices. One night, these three militant women knock on your door with a lot of struggles on their backs. They want to speak, Vicenta. With you, with Valeria. They want to ask you if the decision has been made for Laura to carry on with her pregnancy, or if you would prefer an abortion, if it were still possible. And you bring out all the rage from these past few days, and tell them that if these guys don’t let Laura have an abortion, you are going to raise the baby. By yourself. Because there is no way on Earth you will give it to those sons of bitches. You tell them all those things and they listen. And understand. Then you tell them that during Laura’s last ultrasound, for the first time, they didn’t let you in. And that many hours later they told you that the abortion could no longer be performed. And then Valeria says what’s in the air, what everyone thinks: that she believes they lied about the time of the pregnancy so they don’t have to perform that abortion, and she asks if they really think it’s still possible without it being risky for Laura, without having to go to jail for it. There’s doubt, there’s fear, of course, but the answers encourage you, Vicenta. You. Valeria… And you tell them yes, yes, that they should look for that doctor who can perform the abortion, and you also say that if everything goes well, you’re going to go to Luján and you’re going to thank the Virgin. So a women’s network embarks on a silent task: asking, begging, insisting, holding conversations all across the country in order to find a doctor willing to perform that abortion Laura needs. What a relief, Vicenta, what a relief. Laura is calm now, back in her stuff. Meanwhile, slowly, your life also resumes its course. The landscape is similar: your house, your daughters, the little grandson. But everything has changed for you. You have changed. After so many years being quiet, looking down, tied to other people's decisions, today you will start looking up forever You will stand up before others as equals. Before life. No one else will decide on your behalf, Vicenta. Everything has changed. And you start from the beginning. From what was pending. You learn to read, write, add, subtract. So you don’t have to depend on others for these things anymore. And for the first time, you dare to look for a formal job. Legal, with a salary, vacation, contributions, family allowance. And you find it, of course. How won’t you be able to achieve that after all you have achieved lately? A job as an assistant at a school is waiting. And there are news. The criminal lawsuit for Laura’s abuse has a new district attorney, and a few weeks later, the perpetrator is behind bars. And all of this is new, and it’s welcome. But it’s not enough. Because, how long does an abuse last? That of an uncle? That of the institutions? One day you reunite with your mates, and it’s a more serene encounter. You don’t depend on Laura’s time anymore. But everyone knows there are other times at stake, that other women are now going through what your family went through just a few months ago. And that is why the talk goes to the past but then comes back, urgently, to the future: what can we do for this not to happen again? So you won’t rest now that you’re able to: you’re going to devote yourself body and soul to an idea that belongs to everyone. Together you decide to sue the Argentine State before an International Court LMR V. the Argentine State “…in LMR’s case, the State’s lack of diligence in guaranteeing a legal right to a procedure only required by women had, as a result, a discriminatory practice that violated her rights. This infringement is even more serious if we take into account that this woman was underage, disabled and poor, due to which the State’s duty to protect her rights was of the utmost importance. Given that abortion is a problem that only affects women and that, in the social imaginary, is filled with all kinds of prejudice, the way Court officials and the medical staff of the San Martín Hospital in La Plata handled themselves was discriminatory, and the provincial and national authorities were ineffective when it came to making them obey the law, denying LMR her right to a legal, safe abortion. That is why we respectfully ask the United Nations’ Human Rights Committee: 1) To establish the international responsibility of the Argentine State. 2) To order the Argentine State to implement hospital protocols that will allow to make viable the access to a legal, quality abortion, and the mechanisms to implement that right. 3) To revise the national legal framework in regards to abortion in general, which sanctions women who interrupt an unwanted or forced pregnancy and leads them to resort to illegal abortions that put their lives and health at risk. ” Taking pictures with one of those cameras is something else. You have to choose the lens, then you have to choose the right exposition, breathe deeply. Attention, don’t move. Ruling from the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations April, 2011 “The Committee considers that the State’s lack of diligence in guaranteeing a legal right to a procedure only required by women constituted, in the first place, a violation of the right to equality, and may have resulted in a discriminatory practice in relation to LMR. The Committee considers that the obligation imposed on LMR of continuing her pregnancy constituted cruel, inhuman treatment. The Committee considers that the State’s omission, not guaranteeing LMR the right to the termination of her pregnancy, caused physical and moral suffering in the young woman, made more serious due to the fact that this is a young woman with a disability. The Committee considers that the events constituted arbitrary meddling in LMR’s and her family’s private life through the Justice Department, in a matter that had to be resolved between the patient and her doctor. The Committee considers that the events configure a violation of LMR’s right to live, given that the State did not take the necessary measures or observe the diligence due in order for the young woman to be able to safely interrupt her pregnancy, thus avoiding her subjection to an illegal abortion. For these reasons: 1) The Argentine State has the obligation to provide LMR with reparation measures that include adequate compensation. 2) The Argentine State also has the obligation to take measures in order to avoid similar violations from taking place in the future. 3) The Argentine State must, in a maximum of 180 days, provide information on the measures it has adopted in order for this ruling to be fulfilled. ” HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE BUENOS AIRES PROVINCE DECEMBER, 2014 In this public act of reparation for the LMR case, we have the President of the Women’s National Council, Mariana Grass, PUBLIC REPARATION FUNCTION, LMR CASE the Nation’s Undersecretary of Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, Carlos Pizonni, the Secretary of Human Rights of the Province of Buenos Aires, Mr. Guido Carlotto. Also present are officials from the Nation’s Department of Human Rights, national officials, officials from the Province’s Ministry of Health, officials from the Province’s General Consultancy, officials from the Department of Human Rights, and other officials from the province, LMR and relatives. How long does a day last, Vicenta? What about a year? And eight? Eight years have gone by, with all the things, with all the life you carry inside, and now the obligatory apologies arrive, the words that are said because someone requested they were said, now that the landscape is different, and that neither you nor Laura need them anymore. Although perhaps you do, perhaps they are necessary, not for Laura, not for you, but in the large path of women’s rights. I’ll just tell you that I wish abortions were performed immediately, and that they’d stop murdering us. And for the law to be followed, the abortion law should be followed, because an abortion is a horrible thing, and they had no right to make us have that baby, and as they told me at the time, as other people told me, “have it and we’ll give it up for adoption,” and it’s not that, because the law was there to defend my daughter and I just wanted the law to be followed. At that moment, the state was not present. But now I ask for the state to be present, and for abortion to be legal so that what happened to me doesn’t happen to anyone else. To Vicenta and her family, with deep admiration and respect.
