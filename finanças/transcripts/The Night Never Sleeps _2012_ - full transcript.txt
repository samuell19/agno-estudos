(sirens wailing) (car horn honking) Hey, cop? Cop? Come on, man. I'm talking to you. Are you married? You got kids? My LCL boys are gonna find your family. We're gonna fuck your wife... ...and then we're gonna kill your kids in front of her. And then we might just fuck her again. But you know what? Don't worry. You know, we're not gonna hurt her because we want her to go back to you... ...so every time you touch her, she thinks of us. What do you think of that? Hey, you're a piece of shit, man. You know that? Wherever you're going, it's a dark place, man. You're crossing into a dark place and you can't come back. Fuck you, man. Fuck you and your fucking life. You fucking piece of shit. Somebody like you, man, fucking... You been pretending your whole fucking life, man. And now you're gonna live for real, like me. (laughs) And the best part is I get to be here to see it. What do you think of that? (sirens wailing) (siren wailing) (heels tapping) (horn honking) (music continues) (grunting) Rourke: Let go! I'm a police officer. Police officer! (crashing) Cavanaugh: Police, don't move! Get up. I'm the fucking law. Get up. Detective: Put your hands back! Cavanaugh: On the floor. You're a fucking moron. Don't fucking move. Spread your fucking legs. Don't fucking move. What the fuck is wrong with you? Don't you know how to listen? Give me your fucking car, will ya? Don't move. Rourke: He just ripped me a new one. Well, you don't know where you are. What, you're gonna start on me now? You're not in the bag anymore wearing a tool belt and a baton, extra ammo, cap stun. I've patrolled some real shit. This isn't gigs in community service in personnel. Weekends and holidays off, straight days, straight to the gym everyday. I bet you like to spend a lot of time in the tropics. Health food, health shakes, and now you want to be a cop. This is not my first day on the job. Where's your ear piece? I was fine. What are you supposed to do when they grab your shit? I handled it. Where's your gun? Well, you're playing a very different game here. Get your head outta your ass and look around. On the north side of Broadway you got Chicos Locos. On the south side, you got the White T's. And popping up everywhere else you got the Flying Dragons, but do you know where they all meet? Right here, right where you're standing. I'm damn good at what I do. We're all police officers. That's what it says on the ID card in our wallet. But we are not all cops. I'm a cop. Okay. You can buy the coffee. Thug: Fuck you, bitch! I'm gonna sue you -You mother fucker! -Detective: Hey, calm down. (thug groans) Huh? What was that? (groans) Cavanaugh: What was that? You know, if you kill 'em, I ain't doing the paperwork, man. You're doing it. (grunting and groaning) Detective, can you get rid of this piece of shit please? These dirty fucks. You got some of that scale gel? -Yeah. -Here, knock yourself out. I got plenty of it in my bag. He deserved a beating. He should be going to the hospital or the morgue. We don't do that anymore. Woman: Senor ? Perdon. -Yeah, sure. -Woman: Senor, policia? Senor, gracias por esta aqui. De nada. What was that? Just came by to say thanks for being here, man. (sirens wail in distance) Okay. (techno music plays) (clinking glasses) -Hey. -Hi. How long have you been here? A little while. I was hoping to see you tonight. (indistinct conversation) Where's my drink? Where were you last week? I waited for you. I was busy. Busy? Man: Move! Here you go, Victor. Simon, how the hell are you? I'm okay, Victor. I can't complain, you know? One day at a time, man. I don't want no trouble. He's fucking with us. (speaking foreign language) Sorry. I was just trying to help out my boss. Man, you know? (unintelligible speech) You're fucking boss. It's all there, man. Take it all. I ain't dying for nobody. Marisol. Marisol, you're looking so beautiful tonight. I mean, you look good enough to eat. You know? How are you doing? Are you fucking him now? Hmm? Is this yours? How much you paying for this? Come on, you can tell me. How much he paying for you? I mean, how much does a blow job for somebody like this go for? What? Was that an insensitive question to ask? I mean, you think she's a whore, right? Is that... Is that right? She's a whore? Isn't that what everybody thinks? She's a whore? Iceman: You all think she's a whore, right? Well, you're not a whore to me. You know why? Because I don't pay for it. Let me show you. (crying) Ah, yeah. That's my girl. (yelps) Come on! Say, "Do that again." Come on, show me. (crying) Hey, hey, hey. Where do you think you're going? Relax. Hey, hey, hey. I said relax. -Iceman: That's it. -Don't be a hero. Yeah, what's the matter? Why are you crying? Enjoy the show. Come on. Look at me! Look at me! (screaming and crying) Tell them all you're not a whore. Tell them all you're not a whore. (screaming) (gunshot) (speaking foreign language) (gunshot) (screaming) (gunshot) (siren wailing) I took you for a heathen. St. Francis. My old man gave it to me when I got sworn in. - That's sweet. - Sweet? Yes, that's nice. That's a good thing. He was born October, 4th, the feast of St. Francis. He carried it while he pushed a radio card and after 28 years, he retired and then he got whacked by a deewee on the Grand Gentral, helping some lady fix a flat tire. Lord, make me an instrument of thy peace. Where there is hatred, let me sow love. Where there is doubt, faith. Where there is despair, hope. Where there is darkness, light. Where there's sadness, joy. I'm very impressed. St. Mary's, all girl high school, then on to St. John's University. What the hell are you doing here? You should be in law school. I dropped out. Silly me. I joined the department to be a cop, not some skirt behind a desk. I get it. Listen. Keep your eyes and your ears open and your mouth shut and you're gonna be a good cop. Play it smart. That's the key to going far in the department. Do you play it smart? Officer (over radio): Crime Sergeant 2876 on the air? Crime Sergeant. Crime Sergeant, we have a confirmed Memo was shot in the Mexico Lindo Bar to the confines of 119, 18909 112th Street. That's 18909, 1-1-2 Street. 85 Duty Captain on the scene, North Wood. (radio chatter) Okay, Mike. What do you got? Working on it. No witnesses, robbery, no cash in the till. We're trying to locate the owner, Wilber Moran. I think somebody snatched his shield and his ID. (sobs) Cavanaugh: Stan, it's okay. It's okay. Move! (sobbing) I told him to wait outside and why the fuck didn't he listen to me? Stan, let's go outside. Come on. You help Mike with whatever he needs. Come on. Let's talk outside. (radio chatter) Cavanaugh: All right, give. I told him to sit in the car and watch the place until I got back. I mean, the poor kid must have got bored. I don't know. I mean, why else would he go in the bar without any backup? What am I gonna tell his wife? I don't know. What are you gonna tell the bosses? Where the fuck were you? Don't tell me you were out chasing some skirt. I'm fucking sorry, Chief. God damn it, Stan! Just tell me what to do. I'll do whatever you say. (sirens wailing) Just don't talk to anybody. (Stan sighs) Wilber, take off your hat. I'll take my hat off. The bartender, what's his name? His name is, uh, Simon. Simon Flores. Phone number and address. I don't know where he lives, but you know, his cell phone, I've been trying to call it, but he ain't been answering. Mike: Come on, Wilber. You don't know your employees' address? What? I don't know where he lives. He's a bartender, he's off the books. I don't know where he lives. Any idea who might want to rob your establishment? No, I have no idea who would do this. I really don't. Thanks, Mike. You know, I really want to help you guys, but... (grunting) Get up, Wilber. Come on, Wilber. Wilber: You can't do this. You can't do this. This ain't right. Listen, I'm the fucking victim here, remember? I'm the guy that got robbed. We just want a list of your regulars and Simon Flores, the bartender's address. I'm an American citizen. I got my fucking rights. I been in this neighborhood all my life. You can't do this. Forget your Yankee-doodle-dandy bullshit! We know about you, Wilber. To us you're just a turd floating on the top of the bowl waiting for us to give you the big flush. Now, you're gonna tell Detective Jablonsky everything he wants to know, otherwise we are going to close down this rat hole and every shit infested bodega you got! You got regulars! Think. Come on! All right, I got a regular for you. -All right, her name is Marisol. -Cavanaugh: Who? Marisol, Marisol Wahowadora. She comes here once a week on pay days. I mean, you go see her. I mean... She plays with men for money. She's a prostitute. Thank you, Wilber. Jesus! You should be so lucky. Meet me around the corner. You can stay. So you have a problem today? Am I talking to IAB Inspector Romanelli or am I talking to Carmine? You know, I don't know what you got yourself into. It's in Rosaso's office now. You know me. I'd say about three cups of coffee. I'm cool, Carmine. I'm clean. Yeah, I know. You're like a choir boy, right? I guess that makes me the fucking Pope, right? If this was on the record you'd be in my office right now with your delegate. I'm sorry. You're what? You're sorry? What are you doing? Do you know we'll have a ball with you? Do you understand that? They're gonna be all over this, whatever this is and for what? Because you get a cop shot to death while on duty, in some bar and there's no witnesses and it's partner is off taking a powder? And you're doing what? You're the boss. You're playing patty-cake with this babe? For what? Because she wears a tin? -What the fuck? -Are you fucking stupid? What the fuck are you talking about? Don't be a cluck. Use your fucking head. It's not about truth, is it? It's about how things look. Do you understand? How we're perceived. It's about decorum, huh? Yeah. Well, give me a little smoke and mirrors, will ya? Give me something. Because right now, I can't believe you ever fucking worked for me. You're a first line supervisor, pal. That's bullshit. Hey, grow the fuck up! It's your job! Bad shit happens, you hold the bag, pal. That's the gig. You signed on. And these bosses, they need to throw one to the lions, they give fuck all about you, me, or the first marine. Get back to work. - I'm driving. - Where we going? Let's go for coffee. (car engine starts) Fuck it! We still got a big deal to do tonight. The rest of them, forget it. We know where everybody lives in this neighborhood and we know where their babies sleep. They ain't gonna say shit. It's the loners you got to look out for. Flores, the bartender. Marisol. Marisol. Marisol. (neck cracks) There's only so many places she can go. (water running) She ain't leaving. She ain't leaving because she knows. She knows how it is. She's gonna wait for you. She's gonna wait for you! But you gotta clean this shit up. You gotta clean this shit up. You gotta clean this shit up! So clean it up. (water running) (footsteps) (sirens wailing) - Hey, babe. - What's up, baby? What's up, handsome? You smell good. Thank you. I bet you taste even better. I bet you taste even better. You gonna lend me a sample? (laughing) -Come with me. Take off work. -Uh-um. -Take off work, let's go. -I can't, I can't. (speaking foreign language) Nothing. (speaks in foreign language) -Can I help you with something? -Who the fuck is this guy? Who the fuck are you raising your voice? (speaking foreign language) -What the fuck are you doing? -Whoa, whoa, whoa! -Who is this guy? -Who is this fucking guy? What the fuck is going on over here? Don't fuck with my wife! Yeah, keep backing up. Keep backing up. Yeah, get back! Carlos: Get this fucking guy out of here. (yelling and arguing) Get this fucking guy out of here. What are you doing messing with my wife? Carlos, come on. Did you get what you want? What the hell was that? Come in the back. Let me make you some coffee. -I'll get you a coffee. -Sure. Maria, lo cafe por favor? What was that there? Carlos thought his wife is cheating on him. Is she? They call him Biano Cholo. He runs with Chicos Locos. (speaking foreign language) Any problems you call me. You know that. Thank you. Is everything okay? Are you still sleeping with your wife? No, that's over. Good for you. You have a problem, call me. Okay. (sighs) (phone ringing) I'm working. Make it quick. The kids need some money. I mailed you a check and you cashed it. My brother Anthony's wedding, okay? The girls need new dresses. They need new shoes and if you could help out with the tickets? I take care of my girls. Tell them I'll call them in the morning. Okay, if you can't help with the tickets then I can ask Greg, all right? He'll do it. Hello? Who's that? The Devil? No, that's the devil's sister. (Latin music) (sighs) Victor, my friend. Welcome. (speaking foreign language) Allow me to introduce your hostess, Rosanna. (greets in foreign language) Rosanna. As always, Victor, the meal is on the house. Gracias. (speaking foreign language) Hey Jefferson, let me ask you a question. Do you tap that? No, no, not me, Victor. Come on, man, be honest. Convince me. No, Victor, I'm not lying. You mean to tell me you didn't fuck that? All right, look Victor. I was planning on fucking that. I just haven't had the chance yet. My man, Jefferson. You a pimp now. Because if I find out that you fucked her, and you lied to me and I'm fucking your sloppy seconds, I'm gonna cut your fucking balls off and I'm gonna feed them to you piece by piece. Hey, Jefferson. I'm curious, man. You ever try to suck your own dick? (laughing) I mean, he looks like the kind of guy that would try that, no? You know, bend over as far as you can, but you can't quite get it. That's life, ain't it? You never quite get there. Like that fucking jacket you got on. Never quite get there. I don't know what you're gonna do about it? You smiling? Is he smiling at you? You want to ask him for a date? You don't ask me for a date, do you? I might say yes. And then what are you gonna do? (horn honking) (speaking foreign language) - What are you two doing here? - We like the coffee jugs. That's very funny. You're gonna get me killed. Overreacting a bit? Simon Flores, he's a bartender. -You know him? -No. No, that quick, no. Since when you start hanging out with the Victor Vargas crowd? Hey, I'm just a man running a business. They come in here to eat just like everybody else. Well, eating is not a crime, but murder, rape, extortion. See where I'm going here? Is there a problem, officers? I know you. I know Nester, Iceman. Is this our friend from the bakery? What's your name, shit-for-brains? Tito Morales. Oh, I'm sorry, did you want to see a drivers license? - How old are you, Tito? - Twenty-four. - Think he'll make his 25th? - No, not this one. There's a Mexican restaurant on Broadway. You know it? We don't hang with Mexicans. I thought all you amigos hung together. Only when we're banging your mama. (laughing) Sit down, asshole! (speaking foreign language) And there is some bad shit that went down there tonight. What are you even doing here, man? This is not your neighborhood. Some shit went down, we can take care of it, but you don't know these people. You can't even read the menu in here, man. (speaking foreign language) I'm sure Sergeant Cavanaugh here is just going his job. Victor: Ain't that right, Sarge? So when they make you a Sergeant, they give you this piece of ass to hang around with? Victor: Apparently. Tonight, sweetheart... (speaking foreign language) -Whoo. -Rourke: Right. Sooner or later, we're gonna know what you know. Let's hope you don't know much. Let's go. Did you see the video? That was my father's candy store. Officer (over radio): 12-8-16, 201 please?

Greg is moving in here, soon. Okay? - I need you to take your stuff. - What did you say? Yeah. You heard me, he's moving in. Listen, you want to fuck that four-eyed geek, that's up to you but you're not gonna do it in my house while my kids are still living there. Your house? Really? You know what, I'm glad I made this decision. Listen to me, you bitch! Oh, no, no, no. We're not doing that. Hello? Man: Let's do business. Right here, right here. Are we doing this or not, man?

I mean, I know you say no marriage can survive communication. Well, you know, nobody can be married to you period. Period. Well, nobody is. I liked you, man. I loved you. I laughed at your jokes. I was good to you. What the fuck is wrong with you? Do you even know what I do for a living? While you and your friends are eating your cucumber sandwiches, I got to tell some family why grandma got her throat slit by some crackhead. It's all about your work. Do you understand? Do you understand how you blew this marriage? I mean, the shit that I put up with. Victor: Come on over and introduce it. I'm the fucking sweet king, brother . Come on, man. Who you talking to? (speaking foreign language) In the street they're paying like 45. I don't give a fuck about the street. Man, come on. Am I a fucking kid or what? We go way back. Look, I hate fucking charities, alright. Three fucking bags of sweets, 40 a bag. Call it even. We good? Okay, okay. (church bell ringing) Priest: I heard the siren from the rectory. A disease is spreading, padre , you know? Priest: All these killings? Yeah, it's good for business, yours and mine. You don't really believe that. The good citizens of this place don't give a shit unless it happens in their backyard. As long as Mrs. Manacotti can walk down the street in Howard Beach, nobody gives a fuck if Jose gets his brains blown out in Jamaica. You're wrong, TC. Am I? Are you guys any better? You got a church in this neighborhood with no roof, with no floor. I can go less than one mile away the other side of the tracks and their making over 50 grand on their Sunday collection. If you're looking for a fight, you ain't gonna get one here tonight. I lost a man tonight! I know his wife. I know his kids. He's got a brother on the job and he was 38 years old. I'm sorry guys. What's his name? Delgado. Michael Delgado. Play by the rules officer. Get the job done, but don't cross any lines. What the fuck is that supposed to mean? You know what I mean, and watch your language. Lines? Rules? There are no rules. You walk around that college just to save your own ass. I said watch your language! Play by the rules, TC. It's the only thing that separates us from the savages. (radio chatter) I never heard anyone treat you like that. (radio chatter) Yeah, you never met my ex wife. What's that about? He's heard my confession over the years. IAB. He knows you by your first name. Yeah, so? You gonna write a report? What are you? A cheese eater? You want a slice of Swiss? Where do you get off talking to me like that? I get it, TC. They're killing cops out there. Nobody's safe. So let's take care of this. I'm not that cop anymore and you're not gonna be that cop. You have to play it straight. That's the way you get through nights like tonight. That's the way you get through all the nights. That's the difference between us and the perps. Are you confessing to me now? I don't know. Are you wearing a wire? You wanna frisk me to find out? (phone ringing) Cavanaugh. Yeah, we'll be there in ten minutes. Victor: What the fuck are you saying? They found this motherfucker? No, man. Fuck that! If this motherfucker talks, we're dead. (speaking foreign language) You gotta kill this motherfucker! (speaking foreign language) This is what I'm fucking paying you for! Son of a bitch! -Where is he? -Room three. All right, Williams, you're gonna be the customs agent. (bell rings) Williams: Okay. Mike: I didn't hear that. I'm outta here. All right, we're going to room three. Simon, this is Arthur Turner, US Customs Agent. He wants to offer you a proposition. Mr. Flores, the United States government is willing to overlook the fact that you entered this country illegally. All we have to do is help Sergeant Cavanaugh. I don't do law a favor. That's funny. You're a funny guy. Let's see how funny you are when you get off the fucking plane in El Salvador. I'll send you a postcard. Williams: That would be nice, of course, that is if you ever get there. See, you'll be spending a lot of time in the joint first. With the general population. Yeah, you'll get to hang with your buddies, play dominoes. Say adios to your amigos . How does that sound? All right, I'll help you. What happens to me? We'll set you up out west, new identity. Do you have some coffee? Can I have some coffee? Tell me what happened from the beginning. Simon: I'll talk after I talk to my lawyer. (Cavanaugh laughs) Simon, you are so full of shit. You got three bench warrants in Suffolk County. Criminal possession of stolen property, grand larceny, resisting arrest. I mean, are you fucking shitting me? All right, let's take this guy out of here. Who wants COT? -I'll take him. -No, no, no, no. You know what? Rourke, you go with him. No, no. I got him. It's okay. No, I got him. I got him. It's a two man job. -Let's not fuck this one up. -Stan: All right. (door creaks) How long does it take to close this place, Wilber? I've been waiting here all night. I didn't know you were out here. You know I wouldn't make you wait for me. You didn't know I was coming here? -Wilber: No. -You know we got some shit to talk about, right? I know. It's fucked up. Iceman: Yeah. I heard you talked to our friends before. I didn't talk to them. They talked to me. They were there, but I didn't say nothing to them. You didn't say nothing to those cops? No, as a matter of fact, I told them all to go fuck themselves. Well, because the way I look at it, Wilber if you said anything, you got two choices. I can fucking kill you... ...or I could fuck you in the ass. Why you always got to fuck with me, man? (laughing) Listen, no listen. Now, look at me. -Look at me. -What? Seriously, you gotta be careful. They're coming down hard on everybody tonight so you gotta keep your mouth shut, right? You ain't got to worry about me. You know that. Come on. All right. Look at me real good. Look at my good eye. (laughing) You ain't got to worry about me. You know that. I'm just checking. I'm checking. I know you're good. You're straight. You're gonna keep your mouth shut though, right? You got my word. -You have a nice Christmas. -You too, man. -All right? -You and your family. Oh, hey. One more thing that I forgot. What? (slash) Now I know you ain't gonna say nothing. Hey, I think we're being followed. No. No, man. We're all right. We're cool. (horn honking) Ah, shit. Ah, man. I gotta take a piss bad. You wanna pull over? Officer (over radio): ...119, 11605 Sutter Boulevard. Bodega, a 24 DOA, confirmed dead. (gunshot) Oh, what the fuck, man! (gunshot) 1013, 1013. B-Way and 138. Officer down.

She's smart. She's tough. She's gonna be a star. Well, she had a great boss. I had a great boss. What's the matter, Carmine? We just had another one. Shot. Jesus, where? Off the E-Way. The 116. In the back of the head. 116? What was his name? Her name. (siren wailing) He was like, 5'7"-5'8" Spanish dude. He came out of a dark sedan, but, you know, it happened so quick. I couldn't see. I don't know what the fuck it was. TC, I'm sorry. It was all my fault, man. What did you do, Stan? All I did was ask her to pull over so I could take a piss. That was it. What did you do? That was it and a sedan came by, this guy started shooting. That was it. I wanted to take a piss. What did you do? What did you do? That was it, man. (screaming and yelling) Officer: Get him out of the crime scene. Officer: Don't touch the car. (phone ringing) I can't talk now. Mike: Go home. We can take care of this. She was doing it right. She was gonna be one of the good ones. (phone ringing) Mike: It's me. Yeah, McDermot. All right. No, no, no. He's with me. Yeah, ten minutes. No, go on. Go on. Good job, thanks. Wilber Moran just bought the farm. There was a robbery outside one of his bodegas. Witnesses? Leads? Caught. They all beat feet. This may be something or it may be bullshit. That whore, Marisol, was hanging around with this asshole Hector who worked out of this place on 138th Street. -I know where that is. -Wait, wait, wait, Tommy. We can take care of this. -Yeah. -What are you gonna do? Do you really want to know? It all goes down tonight. Okay. Yeah, I'll talk to you later. Hey, you ready for tonight? Yeah, we all straight, man. This is for our cop friend. Oh, fuck this, Victor. Fucking too generous. He's not worth that much. What about the bitch at the bar? I got a line on her. I'm gonna take care of Marisol myself. Don't worry about anything. When have you ever known me not to fucking worry about anything, huh? You do realize how fucking big this deal is tonight, don't you? You take my share, how about that? I'm gonna do this shit for fun. That's why I'm so good, man. You better be better than good. Tonight, you better be fucking great. You understand? You fuck. (laughing) My turn, Vargas. My turn. (footsteps) (moaning) Shit. (laughing) Hola, Hector. I haven't seen you in a while. -Take a walk, sweetheart. -No, no, no, baby. Hold on. Take a good look, chief. This is number one, grade A, government inspected ass. She'll give it to you anyway you want, Sergeant. Hey, officer, do you want me... (speaks foreign language) I'll suck your cock real good. Right? I'm good. You like it? Tell me the truth. (speaks foreign language) Why don't you just get off his back? Come on. You want to touch it or do you want me to take my dress off right here, maybe? I don't need a fucking moron to suck my cock. (speaks in foreign language) Chief, you know? I think me and you, I think we're the same. You keep people safe. I keep them happy. I'll make you feel like a real man. Marisol? You know her? No, man, I don't. I don't got no Latin ass. I got black ass, white ass, chink ass and a dot head bitch. You're the United fucking Nations, aren't you? Yeah, I'm a peacemaker. You want a piece? So you don't know shit. Who the fuck does? Does that lone biker, Carl? He's got a chop shop down town. Right, he loves the Latin pussy. Chief... Come back anytime. I want, you love. Oh, I'll be back. You can guarantee it. Get upstairs. (radio chatter) (door slams) -Hey, Stanley. -Hey. You looking for a little pussy tonight? No, I don't want no pussy. I want my money. Where's Vargas? Oh, he couldn't make it, but he asked me to give this to you, you know? Yeah, we needed you to take care of Simon, but what you did to that lady cop... That was some bad ass shit. I wouldn't want to fuck with you, man. All my money's not here. This isn't all the fucking money! -Where is it? -Oh, you got to relax. Listen, you spic bastard. I'll fucking skin you and Vargas alive if I don't get my fucking money. (stabbing) See, what's funny is... Tonight the only one left who knows what went down is you. You make too much noise. I fucked up my jacket. Still chasing the Latin gash, Carl? I lost two men tonight. -I'm eating dinner. -Dinner is over, Carl! Take it easy. I'm looking for a whore named Marisol. I don't know her. I can't help you. Well, maybe I should just burn this fucking place down, Carl! I can point you in the right direction. Which direction would that be, Carl? That would be a dump in Jackson Heights. There's a flea bag motel. They run whores out the back. Most of the clientel is Spanish dudes. Run by a prick named Iceman. Iceman's a sick fuck. -Are we even? -Fuck you, Carl. (phone ringing) What? Mike: They found Jablonsky dead. What the hell are you talking about? Mike: Somebody stabbed him. He's been stabbed a couple of times. Look, everybody and his brother is down here. All right, I'm behind Vernon Boulevard, 31st Street, behind the lumber yard. Just get here, man. (sirens wailing) (radio chatter) Jablonsky's phone has got Vargas number in it. And fucking Internal Affairs rats have been out here all night watching me and they're looking for you. They want to know why they got two fucking bosses that don't know why three of their guys get killed in one night. So what do you want to do? You got to buy me 20 minutes. I got a lead on Marisol. All right, all right. All right, where I'm going, I'm going to text you the address. I need you there in 20 minutes. All right, don't fuck me. We can't find Cavanaugh. -Hmm. -We can't find him. A couple of minutes, will ya? He's one of my guys. What? You gonna kick me out? No, no, no. Ten minutes. Cavanaugh, my office! In 15 minutes! -Can I talk to her? -John: She's all yours. Let's not worry about that now. When was the last time you used? A few hours ago. You're gonna tell me what I need to know and you're gonna tell me now. I know who you want and what you want her for. She won't talk. Let me worry about that. And what do I get if I give you the address? What about what you don't get? Like your freedom and all the drugs and cash I find here. (speaking foreign language) Give me an address! 3708. 31st Street. Under the L train . 31st Street under the L. Let's go. (tapping) Did you think I was gonna not find you? I've been looking for you all night. No, no, no. We have to talk. -You done in there? -Yeah, we're all good. All right, shut it down. I got an address for Marisol. Let's go. You gonna... You gonna unlock this? You're not gonna make me break it down, are you? Come on, honey. I just want to talk to you. Marisol: Haven't you done enough? No, not yet. (car engine revs) Don't you want to play with me a little more? Listen. I want to talk to you seriously, okay? (door crashing) (yelps) It's okay. It's okay. Sit down. Okay, we're just gonna talk for a little bit. All right? Here. There you go. Yeah. Oh, come on. I just want to tell you that what I did to you before tonight... I'm not sorry for that... ...because when I was inside you I was giving you love. You probably don't even understand that, you know? You don't even get it, but that's what I was doing. That's why I'm here. Do you know that's why I'm here? I'm here to help you. This life you're in. This shit... This shit we're in. Turning tricks for Hector or whatever the fuck you're doing. I got nowhere to go. That's what I'm saying to you. You got no place to go. I mean, who's gonna get you out of this life? I don't have a choice. You don't have a choice? What if I told you... ...you had a choice. A great choice? You see, they don't know you like I know you. Those cops don't know you like I know you. I'm not going to the cops. I know. I know. You're going somewhere else. You're going somewhere beautiful just like you. You don't have to do this, man, please. -(sobbing) -You don't have to thank me. You don't have to do this. (sobbing) I want to do it. I want to do it. I'm asking please, God. Anything, please. Don't beg. Don't beg. Don't beg! (sobbing) Just go with it. Please. Let me take you there and you'll never have to worry about this life again. That's why I'm here. Come here. Come here. It's okay. Oh, God. (sobbing) I'm here to help you. You don't have to do this, please. I hate you, motherfucker, rot in hell. (laughing) You're gonna burn from the inside out. I'm already there, honey. I'm already there. (thud) Police, don't move! Whoa, whoa. Drop it! You gonna take me out from here? Please. Put it down. -There's no where to go. -Fuck this motherfucker. Light them both up. Okay, okay. I'll cuff him. Come here, sweetheart. (screaming) No! Get your hands flat, flat. Hang on. Hang on. You're gonna be okay, just wait. Crime Sergeant to central, I need a bus. Heavy bleeding, 3708 31st Street, priority. Hold on. Hold on. Officer (over radio): All right, ten minutes,Crime Sergeant, - for that location. -You're gonna be okay. Radio: I'm going to have emergency service and the EMS respond. You piece of shit. What is that? It's Delgado. Give him to me. I'm gonna take him in. Why don't you just fucking call the kids. Get your fucking head on. I'm taking him in! Hey, cop. Cop. Come on, man. I'm talking to you. What are you, Irish? Is that what I smell on you? I was born here too, man. You know that? I was born here. I know my rights. My boy, Vargas, he's got these great Jew lawyers. Wherever you're going, it's a dark place, man. You're crossing into a dark place and you can't come back, man. And you're gonna end up like your dead cop friends, rotting and stinking, man. You been pretending your whole fucking life, man. And now you're gonna live for real, like me. (laughing) I've been doing this my whole life, man. You a fucking rookie. And the best part is I get to be here to see it. (horn honking) What do you think of that? (door slams) Jesus. (slapping) Look at you. Feels good to make your own rules, don't it? Right? We're not like other people, me and you. I'm not like you. Okay. Take me to jail then. No. You want to send me to hell, don't you? Well, you pull that trigger and we're going together. Every night when you close your eyes you're gonna see me in your dreams. (laughing) (gunshot) (phone ringing) What? Hector: Chief? How did you get this number? Hector: I know my ways. Look, you want Vargas? You know I do. I can deliver him on a platter. Cavanaugh: What's it gonna cost me? Nothing, chief. You'd be eliminating my competition. All right, 45 138th Street. Hey, Chief? How come everybody on the street knew Jablonsky was Vargas' boy except you? Hello? (laughing) Stupid son of a bitch. (speaking foreign language) (brakes screeching) (gunshots) (shells dropping) Tito! (screaming) What the hell? (speaking foreign language) (crying and screaming) Tito! Tito! (gunshots) Tito! (crying) Officer (over radio): Units in the 119, 138 B-Way. We have confirmed shots fired. On your knees. On your knees! Well, come on, big man. What are you waiting for? (gunshot) Not bad, huh? Not bad at all, thanks. (gunshot) All right, all right. All right, all right. Sorry, guys. Last man out wins. Officer (over radio): Unit 119, unit 119. 138 Broadway. We got numerous shots fired. Numerous shots fired, that's confirmed. Units, numerous shots fired in the 119. Please, units arrive alive. Police, don't move. (gunshot) (sirens wailing) (phone ringing) Hello. Lisa: TC? You got a minute? Yeah, are you alone? No, it's perfect timing. Everybody is dead. You are so full of shit! Everybody else is dead. Okay, can you speak to me for a second without any of the jokes and the bullshit and the showing off and whatever? I mean, I would think you weren't alone because, obviously, you don't come up with the stand up routine for everybody. Can you talk real to me? I mean, I know you say no... Thank you. Thank you for being here. Thank you for everything. (music continues) Carmine: St. Francis of Assisi. It belongs here. It belongs with her. You're a good cop, Carmine. Too bad you had to go over to the dark side. The dark side? That's kind of funny coming from you. I did what I had to do to get the job done. I don't make a living hunting other cops. Well... Come on, bent cops. I remove the bad apples from the barrel. You know, somebody's got to do that. The whole barrel can go bad. Is this about your investigation? Is that why you're here? You gonna put the cuffs on me personally, or is that their job? What investigation? My case is closed. Everybody's dead. The press is very happy with Jablonsky in his grave. Stan Jablonsky would crawl through broken glass to save another cops ass. He was a cop's cop. I didn't see this coming. No? Maybe I didn't want to see it coming. So you would have dropped a dime on him, if you did? I don't know. I'm just looking for a reason to give a shit again. Oh, you're looking? That's good... ...because we only ask for one thing, you know? You gave your word. You raised your hand. You swore to protect people... ...and that's it. Too darn simple. Keep looking.
