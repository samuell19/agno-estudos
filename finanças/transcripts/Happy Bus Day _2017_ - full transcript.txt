Happy Bus Day A photo? Honey... I can't send you a photo. It's not that. It's just... I have no make-up on. I'll... - Oh, you're home! Where's mother? - I don't know. Is she upstairs? Can you help me? There's so much to do today. What is it, honey? I'll help you. I love learning to cook! What should I do first? Oh, these are so ripe! Don't worry about it. I'll do it. I want to help. Oh, you can rest. I'll do it. Ah-hyeon! Ah-hyeon! Aren't you going to help? Huh? There's so much to do. Just help with the fried food, okay? Hey, hang up. Hang up! Just help me with the fries, okay? Come here. Look who it is! You're Mrs. Kim's son! Are you visiting your mother? - Ah, yes, but who are... - I'm the elder at this church. I know your mother very well. Back when she ran the ABC club, I sold her the bar snacks. Our family is in the wholesale foods business. We sell all the peanuts, dried squid, and such in this area. Wow, you're so big now! Your mother and I are close friends, you see. Would it be okay to park my car here? We're leaving tomorrow morning. Yea? Sure... Sure! I take care of this place, you see. I made this parking lot with my own hands. Dug up the dirt, laid the gravel, flattened it out... I'm praying really hard. I do all-night prayers for your household. I know your family well. You're the second son, right? The eldest has that tic, right? And you run a business? I'm the eldest. The second son has the tic. Of course! Go ahead, see your family. Don't worry about the car. Alrighty! Where are you? You bought the bag, right? What do you mean 'what bag?' Are you joking? After we... After it's done, we need to put it in the bag... I told you not to forget! Yes, mother... You're upstairs? I just called, but you didn't pick up, so... Yes, I just started. I started with the marinated meat, and some vegetables... Yes, I bought some... Okay, I'll bring it up. Mother? I'm here. Okay, come in. Seung-hyun, your favorite chocolate is here... There there... You'll get your chocolate. Be patient... Unwrap these... There here, here we go... Here... Chew carefully. Chew carefully. Spit it out. Will you die by choking on chocolate? How embarrassing. Here, chew carefully. What are you doing? Peel the wrappers! There there... Chew carefully. - How's the food preparation? - I was working on it... Mother, I was going to make pumpkin pancakes and fried sweet potato... - Is that okay? - Why? Did they run out of shrimp? No, it's not that... It's Seung-hyun's birthday... ...and it takes so long to make different dishes... You think your mother-in-law is a dog barking? Sorry? Don't you know there's a reason I told you to make fried shrimp! And if you don't know the reason, you're no better than a maggot. Fried shrimp is Sung-il... I mean, your second son's favorite food. That's right! It's the only thing he eats when he comes home. He doesn't like meat or fish or anything. All he likes are the fried shrimp his mom makes. When someone comes home, they want food like good memories. That's the reason they come home. Do you get it? How dare a daughter-in-law try to play wicked tricks... ...to slack off? I'll kill them all! What's going on? Seung-hwan! I'll kill them all. I'll kill them all. Sister! Come out here! He's got a knife! I'll kill them all! Sister! Come out here! I'll kill them all. Hey, Sung-il! Let go! Hold still! Let go of the knife. Sister! Come out here! - Let go of the knife. - I'll kill them all. Hey JEE Seung-hwan, watch your language. Sang-hoon is your older brother. I'm his sister, not his brother! Goddamnit! Let go! Mom! Mom! I'll kill them all! - Where's mom? - I don't know. Probably upstairs. Stay here. I'm going to check on mom. What are you two doing? Brother... Seung-hwan has a knife. Alright, get up, cutie. Just get up. Get up first. - I'll kill them all. - Who... who are you going to kill? - I'll kill them all. - Alright, so who? I'll kill them all. I'll kill them all. Hey, look at... Look... Look at me. Are you sniffing glue? Hey... this isn't reality now, right? - I'll kill them all. - Seung-hwan doesn't sniff glue... He's been hanging out with a strange man... ...coming home drunk, late at night. - Hey, don't talk about Jung-geun... - Don't shout at your brother! You're the youngest, so behave. I'll kill them all. Alright, stab me. Kill me. See my neck? Slice it. Go ahead. This isn't reality anyway. You said you want to kill me. Hey, stop it. Let's stop it now. What are you doing in front of a guest? Sung-il, what's wrong? Stop it, okay? Why don't you stop them? Me? I'm not good at that kind of thing. What? What? Does he tell you... ...not to kill your family? This isn't reality, so it's not you killing me. You're all witnesses, right? Be witnesses. Kill me if you want. Kill me! Kill me! Sung-il - Kill me! Kill me! Kill me! Stop it! Sung-il! Kill me! Kill me! Sung-il, stop it! - Kill me! - Stop it. Kill me! You... just... You... Don't hang out with that man. I'll kill you if you do. Jung-geun stabbed his father! He's killed 3 people. He always escapes from prison, so the warden won't even take him in. So don't criticize him. Don't criticize him. He's really good to me, so don't criticize him. Don't criticize Jeong-geun! He's really good to me! Jeong-geun... I'm so sorry. Jeong-geun! I'm so sorry! Chew slowly. Did you come here to relax? Can't you see we're busy? Hey! What, mom? Were... were you talking to Jung-bok? Who else would I speak to? Am I talking to ghosts? How dare you... Acting like a rotten bitch. What are you looking at? Am I wrong? No. Mom, you just met her... Go help her. Have you two met? - How are you? - Sure. 'Sure'? I ask how you are, and my sister-in-law just says 'sure'? Mother, should I call her sister-in-law? What do I call her? If she wants to join the family, she'll be sister-in-law. What kind of question is that? You heard, right? Let's be sisters-in-law now. Here, start on the fried shrimp. You know how to batter the shrimp, right? Huh? She... she can't do anything. Just tell her to do small chores. Well then, she can learn. It's not hard. Fine. I'll do it. Hey, drain the mushrooms. Yes, mother. Sister-in-law, you just need to drain the water from the mushrooms. But I'm battering the shrimp now. Oh? Alright, I'll do it. - How old are you? - 34. Oh really? You look younger. I'm 40 - Huh? Ah, I see. What's funny? Look at the two sisters-in-law having so much fun. Stop it now. I'm feeling insulted now. Why are you angry all of a sudden? It's nothing, mother. Hey, sister! The tea's cold. Tea should always be hot. Don't serve tea at all if it's not hot. - It's such a hot day, so... - Will you look at this... Sister, what shall we do with her? So ignorant... Tea... should always be hot. All four seasons of the year. Tea is meant to warm the body's chi. Iced coffee? Iced tea? That's asking for a quick death. If a person's chi is cold, the blood hardens. I'm speaking from experience. If you want to drink something cold, you drink cold water! Even water, it's best when lukewarm. Listen to your uncle. Always remember my words. And you'll succeed for sure. Okay? Aren't you going to answer? - You little...! - Yes, uncle. Uncle... Hey... What kind of pen is this? Don't you have a fountain pen? Goddamn... I don't know what you kids lean at school... Pathetic! You bring a cheap ballpoint pen to an adult... The country's going to shit. In the old days, we would commit mass suicide for this. Jeuk-sa! Do you know what jeuk-sa is? You don't know Chinese characters, do you? Jeuk-sa! Long ago, there was a man named Toyotomi Hideyoshi. A famous Japanese hero. Why was he a hero? He used to be Nobunaga's servant. The most despised position of all, the shoe servant. One day, Nobunaga was coming out from a bar. It was snowing hard that day. But his shoe was gone! It's snowing, it's cold, his shoes are gone. What can he do? He was furious. So he looked around... ...and saw Toyotomi Hideyoshi, covered in snow... ...and nodding off to sleep. How pathetic he seemed! On such a cold day, when the other servants are resting inside. Anyhow, his shoes are missing. If the shoe servant loses the master's shoes... That's instant execution! Jeuk-sa! Jeuk-sa! Nobunaga was furious! He called out 'Son of a bitch!' 'Where are my shoes!? How dare you sleep!' Toyotomi Hideyoshi wakes up, and begs 'Forgive me master!' 'I deserve to die. I fell asleep at my post.' He took his master's shoes from his shirt... which he had been keeping warm. He said 'I didn't know when you would come out, so... ...I kept your shoes inside my shirt.' 'Forgive me for keeping your shoes in my dirty shirt.' How impressed was Nobunaga! He was set for life from then on. This is real manners! Real respect! What we should aspire to! Got it? Listen to your uncle. Always have a mind like Toyotomi Hideyoshi. ...and respect your mother here, do you understand? Then you will succeed! For sure! 100%. Got it? Okay? I've given up. Forget it. Alright... Listen to your uncle carefully. For certain, some of you will have second thoughts later on. That's human nature. A sudden change of heart, in a moment of weakness... ...or because you're angry, you might want to back out. So then what happens? If you're not careful... ...it could all go on your mother here. So what do we do? Your mother and I debated this all night long... ...and decided to get everyone's signatures. Documents don't lie. Even if down the road, someone changes their mind... ...this memorandum is proof that we started with the same mind in agreement. So... any questions so far? What? Why? I don't understand any of it. He doesn't know. We didn't tell him anything yet. What? We can't... No, this is... Hey you, Sung-il's girlfriend. You understand, right? If she's just his girlfriend, do you think I would let her be here? - They'll be married soon. - Oh, really? I haven't received your kneeling bow yet... Well, later, then. Hey! What's your question? Well, I'm not sure yet... Of course, I'll follow the family and my husband's decision... ...but he's not here yet, so... Hey! Now that you mention it, where's the eldest? Goddamnit. We need... This is no good. We need everyone here to do it all at once. It becomes confusing. We can become sentimental! Was it okay bringing this in from China? You didn't get caught? Mother, everytime I get a shipment, it's at least 10 tons. If they can't take care of something like this, I can't work with them. They know how much money I make for them... Don't worry, mother. Hey, look at this. The eldest son is the smartest in this family. Look at his handwriting. It's a calligraphic font. That's not easy to do. Look at this chicken scratch handwriting... Try to be at least half as good as your big brother. This is everyone, right? Anyone not sign? Actually, I have a question... As you keep all these documents... What is your role, specifically? What are you doing? Why do you need to know the specifics? He'll take care of it. - I was just curious... - No, no, no... It's a good question. Going forward, if anything happens because of this, I am the final witness. I am your mother's last defence. Why? We are all accomplices. No one else knows. So I am going to oversee the whole process. Why? So that later, we can prevent your mother taking all the blame. Got it? So of course, I will sign one too, and keep it all together. So, I guess your copy, we will... or mother will keep it? Yea, I will keep it. Okay? There, I gave it to your mother, so everything's fair. Uncle, what does this say? This here... This here is... This is a difficult character... Used a long time ago, in the Qing dynasty. This is... Oh look, that means 'snake' here... That's 'viper'! They must have put viper vermon in here. That's what I heard. That's probably right. It says 'Jeuk-sa', actually. So, take care of it by tomorrow... Be strong! I'm proud of you, sister. Thank you so much, brother. I feel even more secure than when father was alive. - Here, your notary fee. - What is this? It had to be paid anyway, so take it. Sister! Alright, I'll take it! Otherwise, she'll be sad, so... I wanted to stay with you until the end, but I have prayer duty tomorrow. I have to write the prayer tonight. Sister, I'll be going. Take care of things. Call me when it's done. I'll be going. Kids... (speaks Japanese) If you always remember this, there's nothing you cannot do. Okay? - Goodbye, sister. - Bye, uncle. Goodbye. - Does he still take money from you? - I don't know. I'm sick of it. What time is it? Look at the time. She must be here already. - If there's a call for me, I'm upstairs. - Yes, mother. Ah, yes, ma'am. It's me. Who are you? The lady I spoke with on the phone... Is she inside? Ah, you're here to see mother. What is it regarding? I was on the phone with her just now. Is there perhaps another family living here? No, this is our mother's house. What are you here for? Ah, I see... I was just on the phone with her... Oh, I'll just call her again. Sorry about that. Why won't you tell me what you're here for? I can't help you if you don't tell me. It's not that... I'll just call her again. She's not picking up... Is this your mother's phone number? - Yes, that's her number. - Ah, so it is! Hey missus, who are you? Well, I'm a charity worker. I wonder where she could be... Hey, tell her to come up. Ma'am! Ah, so there's a path that way... Excuse me... Ma'am... I got lost on the way. Oh, here you are! - How old are you? - I'm 38. Mother, can you check the taste? Why bring that up here? Just let your husband taste it. My eldest daughter-in-law. - Go ahead, say hello. - How are you? Ah, I see. How are you, ma'am? I was rude before. Sorry about that. Mother, what does she do? She told me she's some kind of charity worker. You're right. She's a charity worker. She has sex with people like our Seung-hyun. You really are great. You will be blessed. Who else would do that with kids like Seung-hyun? I'm sure you will go to heaven later. Not at all. I'm just trying hard and being thankful is all. We must all try very hard. Everyone tries hard, don't they? My sister was disabled. Class 1 disability. About 5 years ago, she had a severe depression. She became sick and suddenly died. We have to try hard, very hard. I've said too much... - I apologize. - No, it's okay. I understand. My kid is over 40 now, but he still wears a diaper. So how can he have sex? He can't even meet a woman. But for some time now, near his penis, there were scars... Mother, can you come taste the vegetables downstairs? Sure, sure. I'll come later. Right now, mother. I'm in a hurry. I need to start the other dishes. Will you be quiet? Can't you see adults are talking? Why don't you go bring us something to drink. So anyway... Right! My son is still a man. How much would he want to have sex? But he can't do anything, so he's tearing at his own body. But as I look at him... I just felt so sorry. So one day, I did with my hand for him. - Ah, I see. - It was really difficult. It wouldn't come out. No matter what I did. I don't know. I think his stamina is too good. Mother, we don't have anything to drink. What do you mean we don't have anything to drink? - Go to the market and buy some. - No, no, it's okay. All I need is a glass of water. We don't have any water either. We ran out. Buy some on your way back. I'll give you some money. Ah, sure, of course... I'd like that better. If I eat before working, I get indigestion. Ma'am... Where can I find your son's room? - Over... - Over there, upstairs. Yes, ma'am. I'll be about an hour, give or take 10 minutes... When I'm done, could you bring a basin of hot water... ...and two towels, please. When I call out 'It's finished, ' could you bring them? I'll see you later, ma'am. Hello, how are you? Mother. How can we give her a drink? Who knows what diseases she has? It's very dangerous. You're right. She's gonna go around doing it with all sorts of bums. You did well. I was seduced by her words... Okay, are you eager to meet me? Oh, what a handsome boy! Let's take a deep breath. Breathe in... Let's breathe in. Let's see if we can open your hands. I guess it won't. Let's try touching my face. Relax. Let's be happy now. Okay, you're happy. You're happy. Oh, you're so happy, aren't you? Yes. Then I'll take every part of you, from head to toe... ...every crack and crevice, and I'll suck it all. What? A photo? Honey, can I be honest with you? I've only taken hormones so far, so I look a bit like a man. Honey... So do you not want to meet me? Honey, I can be real good. You really want to meet? Where do you want to meet? I know where that is. It'll take me 30 minutes to get ready. See you soon. You're bored, right? Do you want to try this? This guy really likes these. Fried shrimp. You didn't know? How did you two meet? Game room. Game room? Ah, PC room? I haven't been lately. Isn't it too claustrophobic and stuffy to stay a long time? It's bad for your skin. Also bad for your health. I can't live without game rooms. Before that, I tried to kill myself... 7 times. Slashed my wrists here. Tried eating pesticides twice. Oh... I see. I don't smoke, so the smell really gets me. I really like that smell. The smell of paper cups filled with phlegm. Hey! Hey! Sang-hoon, what the hell are you doing? Sorry, I'm in such a hurry... Sorry. I have a date with a man... Please understand. I have my problems, but this family is just too much. Please understand. Sung-il has nothing going on now, but he'll soon find something. Well, I'm done! That's the problem with fried food. Stomach gets all queasy. When I get that way, I like to suck cock. Excuse me? Coke? No. I want to suck cock. When you suck cock at such times, my mouth feels so refreshing. Honey! Come up! Something's wrong with your brother! - What? What is it? - Your brother! Hurry! - Oh, okay... - Sung-il! Please come! Hurry! - He's going to die like that. - Please, it's nothing. What the... What's going on? Who are you? Ah, I'm a charity worker for disabled people. This really isn't a big deal. Lady! What are you doing? Get dressed! - Go calm him down. - Ma'am, really, this isn't a big deal. - Wait, wait... - Get out of here! It's okay. It's okay... This really isn't a big deal. You can't just go in there like that. Stay still! You're going to kill him. It's okay, it's okay. You can't be so forceful like that... He was just happy... It's okay, it's okay. Put your clothes on! Put your clothes on! Okay. Hey, can I use this? You want to do it with a man? Of course... I'm a woman, so I want to be loved by a man. It's only natural, isn't it? How do I look? Sexy, right? Hey, when you go out, meet a serial killer and get chopped up. Oh my god! I... I really want to play like you one day. Yes... Yes... Yes, I'll see you later. Yes... Jung-geun... I love you. I love you. Hey! What are you doing here? What do you want? Go on your way! You're not going out today, right? I'm meeting someone later. Why? You can't today. It's your big brother's birthday. Uncle even came to sign the memorandums. If you go out today, mom is going to kill you for real. What's the... the deal... with the memorandums? You really don't know what those memorandums are for? What is it? Just tell me! Ah-hyun, are you alone? Where's Sang-hoon? He went out, to meet a man. Went out to meet a man? What about Seung-hwan? You don't know? Hey, where is Ki-tae? He went to the car to get the dishes. What about Sung-il? You told him and sister-in-law to clean upstairs. Ah, I remember. That's right. We have to make the upstairs a livable home. You don't have any complaints about Sung-il coming in to live? Mother, we still live in a rented apartment... It would be nice to live without worrying about rent. And we have a daughter, also... Why do you play favorites? I feel neglected. When I die, you two will get the most! Neglected, my ass... You'll be happy to see me die... But I'll be the one doing memorial ceremony for you every year. I'll be thankful if you do. Mom! Mom! Mom! The memorandum you made me sign... ...was that to say it's okay to kill my big brother? - Seung-hwan, I'll explain... - Mom! I only wrote that because you told me you'll give me 100 dollars. You want me to kill my big brother? Why? When you weren't home, I always changed his diapers. Buy why kill him? Alright, I'll do more. He's so pitiful. Why kill him? Don't you pity him? If big brother dies, Ki-tae becomes big brother, right? Ki-tae already does all the big brother duties! So why kill him? I can't understand it... I don't agree with it, so keep me out of it. And I'm going out later. This is a weird family. I don't understand it. Why are you trying to make me a murderer? - I'm still a minor... - Please, try to listen... Hey! Open the door! I'll give you 200 dollars. Okay? Open the door. Hey! The new shoes you wanted before... What were they? Nike? How much are they? I'll buy you those, too, okay? Just open the door first. How about when I buy the sneakers, I also buy you a tracksuit? There there, listen to what I have to say... - Grab my hair. - What? I said grab my hair, you fucker. What are you doing? Why are you standing there? Sung-il, what do you think you're doing? Excuse me... Sister-in-law... Call me brother-in-law, please. It's okay. Come out. Sister-in-law, do you think what you're doing here... ...makes sense? What is this? Some motel room? Is this your bedroom? How can you be so dense? What I do in my... my own... ...my mother's house... What's wrong with two people in love doing it? What does my sister-in-law have... to do with it? So I guess you've already discussed it with mother? About moving in to this house, right? You must be happy about getting a house for free. Your older brother is upstairs. Your big brother. Alright, I got it... So... Just... mind your own... business, okay? Why is my sister-in-law monitoring my sex life? Huh? Why would I monitor my brother-in-law? Am I some kind of stalker? We're going to be having dinner here... ...so I was bringing the dishes here. Sister-in-law, if you're done here, could you go downstairs first? I have some things to discuss with my brother-in-law. Jung-bok... ...knows it all. It doesn't matter. She can stay. It matters to me. I don't want to talk with her here. I don't mind. I know you two lived together. Such a pretty name... ...may I... ...keep it in my heart? I heard you two lived together for 6 months right after. And Ki-tae was suicidal from that day on. But why did you go back to Ki-tae? After living together for 6 months? That's none of your business. Are you going to stay here? It will be uncomfortable for you to hear. Fine. I'll go downstairs. I guess I'll have fun with Ki-tae. Have fun catching up with each other. Pull down your skirt. What is it? Why is mother mentioning Ye-eun? Huh? Is Ye-eun your daughter? That's... That's why! Let's check if she is. Counting the months, it's while you were living with me. Don't... don't lie to me. I told you. During that time, I slept with your brother once. I told you, and apologized, and we broke up. Whatever... you think I don't know you? You think I would believe that? You're not like that. Even when living with me, it took you 2 weeks... ...to sleep with me. In any case, don't ever discuss this with mother again. Don't make this a family problem. If you do this again, I'm going to take Ye-eun and disappear. Sun-young... KO Sun-young... Did you... ...really sleep with my brother...while you were drunk? I told you I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. You shouldn't call me by my name here. Don't call my name. I won't use your name either, okay? Okay... sister-in-law. Okay, thank you, brother-in-law. I need to prepare dinner. I have to go. Please, okay? We're having dinner now! Happy birthday... big brother. Mother.. Is this enough? Put some more jap-chae on. He loves that dish. Anything else? Don't put too much on. What if he eats too much and gets diarrhea? The drug might not take. Wait, no... It's his last birthday meal... Put on some more meat. Honey... we have to put in the drug now... How much do we put in? Did you swear at sister-in-law? Swear...? What are you doing? I heard you were waiting in front of the bathroom for the two of them. Why would you do that? Making them feel uncomfortable. Is that what sister-in-law said? Do you know what they were doing in there? Who cares what they did? It's their privacy! What are you, the FBI? CSI? Why would you do such an embarrassing thing? Who should be embarrassed? His big brother's right upstairs, and they're doing it... ...that's embarrassing! Hey! I know what happened even without seeing. He was a dog ever since he was born. When he was younger than Seung-hwan... ...he would bring home women 5, 10 years older than him. I don't know how many times I've seen him doing it. He was born that way. Sister-in-law, I've made sure she understands... ...so don't feel too bad. Sung-il, you too! Why didn't you tell me? Must I clean up after you all the time? I may be the head of the family, but... ...it's difficult if my family doesn't talk. We are all... all of us, one family, in the same boat. But what can the captain do, if no one helps? How long are you going to rely on our old mom? Sister-in-law, please excuse me... I had to vent a little. I don't understand what you're saying... Are you going on a boat? Don't listen to me with your ears. Listen to me with your heart! Will you look at that... That there is a senior on our boat. Do you think our boat will float? Okay, okay! I got it. So stop talking, and put the drug in here. Hey, how much should I put in? Ah well, the bottle's small, so... ...just put a little... there's a lot of food, so if he eats it all... ...that'll be a lot, so... Even a little, and you're gone. The seller told me it's strong. Really? ...it's scary. You put it on, here and there, as you see fit. Mother... I don't feel comfortable. I might shake, and just spill it. Here, just give it. I'll do it. Wait... If you just pour it on... ...what if he eats only the other dishes? It doesn't matter. Have you ever seen him leave food on the table? Buy why must it be you who... Why not... just use... chopsticks? It's easy... You think I haven't thought of that? It becomes dangerous for the next person to use that chopstick. We can throw the chopstick out! Good. So I'll do it with a chopstick. Here... Is that okay? Can we throw the chopstick out? Well, then. Of course we'll do it that way. Go ahead, do it. Do I have to do this, too? Fine. Here... I'll do it. He's my son, so I'll kill him. - Did you send photos to him? - Yes. Why did you send it? He asked for it in a text. While you were washing... So I just sent it. 'Hey, you ugly homo pervert fucker.' 'I can't look at your face without throwing up.' 'Don't show your face anywhere.' 'If you ground your face into tofu, and made dumplings...' '...and put that on top of your neck, it'd be better than your face now.' That's awesome. Hey. You're never gonna meet anyone. You have to live here with me... ...until the day you die. It's mine! It's mine! It's mine! Don't touch my things! Is he eating it? Yea... He's eating, just like usual. Mother... Shouldn't you go in? Forget it. He's eating well. Still... It's his last meal... That's... that's right... You should go... go in. That sounds like he wants you. That bastard... Why can't he eat on his own? What? Mommy's here. Drink this water! Eat slowly, will you? Eat slowly, you bastard... Here, Ki-tae... Here, Sung-il... You have a drink, too. - I'm okay, mother. - It's okay. I know you can drink. You did the most work today. It's nothing. You have a drink, too. - Can I have a drink, too? - Me, too. What are you... Aren't you kids underage? - I'm not. - You're not? - Yea. - Then you drink. No. Today, everyone have a drink. I'll pour for everyone. Drink as much as you want today. Ah-hyeon, you have a drink, too. Now, listen to me well... After you finish eating... ...after Seung-hyun is done eating... It'll take some time for him to die... ...for the poison to spread... Each of you go in there for 10 minutes. Have any of you spent more than 10 minutes in his room? This is my last command today. I'll never tell you what to do again. You never listen anyway. I can't do that. What? I have to go now. I have a Line-on raid. What? What is she saying? She has to go to a Line-on raid. It's a game. Game? What game? It's a game you play at a PC room. You fight with swords, and steal from others... It's that kind of game. A raid is when... ...a lot of people get together to invade another castle... - ...at a promised time. - What are you talking about? Hey! Are you going around fighting people? Why are you going to invade someone in the middle of a meal? What kind of people are you? Mom... I for... forgot to tell you... but... I thought we... we would just... eat dinner and finish early. In Line-on, there's a Chinese server... But this is a new... new one. So if we take it, the profit is enormous. This is very important... That's it! Shut up! No one leaves! When the deed is done... When Seung-hyun is dead for sure, then you can leave. - No one leaves before. - Mom, I told you I have to go... Mom says to throw this all out. Put every thing in, including the dishes. Wash your hands now. Make sure they're clean! Okay. Scrub harder, and use the soap, too. Sister... I'm clean. It's not that... Do as you wish, brother-in-law... Sister... don't call me that. I'm your sister-in-law. Even mom recognizes me as a woman. So why do you call me that? It's just... not easy for me. Hey, wipe this with a rag one more time. Yes, mother... What are you doing?! What are you doing?! Fuck! I need to go! I'm going! I have to stop those Chinese alliance fuckers! Why can't I go? - Why can't... - Hey, don't... don't... Shut up, you fuckhead! Shut up! Shut up, you son of a bitch! You know why I need to go. You know... Those fucking Chinese hackers used bots to steal all our stuff! They stole all our items! Do we need to take revenge or not? Do we need to take revenge or not?! Fuck! All those items... ...we earned them by fighting. But those fuckheads just take them with cheats! They can't raid without me! I'm the raid leader! Fuck! Kirin castle! I have to take it today. So... I think the problem is... The situation with China is quite serious... It's not like I don't understand the Chinese... See, if sister-in-law doesn't go... The Chinese are going to use a mass attack strategy. Then Korea will suffer a great loss. Is that right? They don't even have many over level 50. They're all tanks. So let's see here... I think it's right that you go... ...and seeing as now I'm in charge of Chinese affairs here... ...I'll contact you later... Honey, what are you doing? Mother's not saying anything. Alright, fine, let her go. It seems she's desperate. As for the memorandum you signed, no one forced you, so... I'm okay with that. If I die, I die, so... - I'm kind of late, so... - Oh, of course! Go, go! I'll get in touch with you later. Say good-bye to mother... Hey, tell me earlier if you have important appointments. You can talk to me, okay? I'll... just... just take her to the... taxi. Good-bye, sister-in-law! Good luck with the raid! I also need to go out for a bit. - You're meeting that stranger? - Shut up! You don't know... Just do whatever you want! If you come home past 12, you're dead! Come before Seung-hyun goes, and spend 10 minutes with him, okay? Yeah, okay... I'll be back... Hey! Clean up here if everyone's done... ...and get the liquor table ready. Anything fun? I don't know. Go say something to your brother. I don't know. Maybe later. Brother... You know... I really... ...want to be good to a man. So that... he will love me too. I want that. But I can't find a chance. Why is it you and I... ...can't be loved? Now you won't ever have a chance... I'm sorry. Brother... Do you want me to do you? I'll... ...do it with my mouth. But... You have to be quiet. Because... No one understands us. You know Chang-geun, right? The best fighter in Don-am. Ah, Chang-geun... No, I don't know him. He brought her around all the time. I'm sick of them, those bitches, those fucking whores. - You wanna fuck them, too? - Me? Of course I do. I really like Ay-me. This fucker already has an erection. Just wait a bit. I'll let you do it. Really? Wow, I really like Ay-me. So do you have her number right now? You little fucker... You want me to call her now? You want me to call her? I told you to believe me when I talk. - You misunderstand... - You fucker, am I funny to you? No, it's a misunderstanding. I believe everything you say. You know Myung-gyun, right? Used to be the best fighter here. No, I don't know him. I killed him. Because he doubted me. I fucking stabbed him in the eye with a chopstick and killed him. You son of a bitch, you fuckhead. It's really a misunderstanding. I really believe you. - It's a misunderstanding. - This little fucker... You know Doo-shik, right? No, I don't know him. He's the best fighter in Yong-san. We couldn't stand devious little fuckers like you. It's just not forgivable, fuckhead. We used to beat up 50 asswipes like you in a day. I'm sorry. I won't talk back at you anymore. I apologize. This fucker... After all I've done for you, you son of a bitch. Fuck, these bitches are noisy as fuck. I'll rip your pussies open and pour this soup inside. What are you looking at, you fuckers? Just eat your fucking meal. Hey, sit down and have a drink. You work too hard. That's enough. Come sit and have a drink. Hey, what are you doing? She says to sit... Sit. Why are you two always so serious? What are you doing? Pour her a drink. I let you live together, after all that mess... I'd expect you to live well out of gratitude at least... You two don't have the basics of human beings. Hey, what did you do in the room? What do you mean? You told me to spend 10 minutes in there. Your brother... Is he okay? I think so... for now. So... What did you do for 10 minutes? I just... talked about old times... We had a good time. Stick together! Stick together! Good! Good! 1 o'clock direction! Everyone! Stick together! They don't know we have barrier! Barrier! Barrier! 1 o'clock! 1 o'clock! Line up! Line up! Go in! Go in! Stick together! Go in! Go in! Come in! Come in! Stick together! Where the fuck are you going? Hey, stick to the right! You're getting killed, you son of a bitch! Fuck! Stick together! It's alright! Stay still! Stay still! You fucking bitch! - Hey, stand guard. - Yea, okay. What... what are you doing here? Brother! How did you come here? I saw you on the way home, so I came over. Is that him? The guy you follow around? Kneel. What the fuck? You fucker... Get dressed! Get dressed. Do you know Chang-soo? He's the best knife fighter in the country, you fucker. Hey! Who the fuck... Do you know me? Why are you swearing? Wait! Wait! Wait, please! Let me... Let me tell you one thing... Sir, I... Long time ago, my knees... I had a growth spurt... I damaged my knees. So the one thing I can't do is kneel down. But I will stay kneeling... Because I'm sorry. Hey. Can we just kill this fucker? We're the only ones who'll know. Hey! I look at your eyes... ...and I see that bastard of your father's eyes. I could take this chopstick to your eye... ...and stab it out, and I'll still not be satisfied. You should never have been born! You're right... I was cursed like trash from the start... Why? Because I'm the result of my mother being raped by a thug. Oh, I know it. But you know... The husband you loved so much... ...gave you your eldest son, LEE Seung-hyun... Why is it you want to drug him, and kill him? If I don't kill him? If I don't kill him... ...then you guys will kill him, right? When I'm old, and have no money, and have no strength... ...you're just gonna throw him out like trash. You fiends of hell! How did you know? That was a secret. Hey, our mom knows a lot... Honey, stop it. You're drunk. You thought I wouldn't know? You would even throw me out. After you've sucked me dry. I will never be done in like that. You little devils! Mother, we would never do that. Mother, don't be like that. Oh, really? Is that so? Thank you so much for coming into this family. My daughter-in-law has slept with both brothers. How happy I must be! This is very difficult, mother. Our beloved second brother is here! The brother I love so much... so much... ...whom I respect so much, and who is so much better than me... You are a true champion! Ah-hyeon! Ah-hyeon! Our little Ah-hyeon. Did you have a good talk? Isn't Ah-hyeon... Isn't she... so very good? He's not even her brother by blood... He's nothing to her... Yet she goes in to talk to him... Shows him her cell phone... Ah-hyeon isn't even a daughter here... She's nothing here! She's just my sister... From now on, I'll take her to our home... Ah-hyeon, pack your bags! Let's go! - There he goes again. - Go... go in and sleep. Sister-in-law, you too. Take him in... Ah-hyeon, you too. Go in. Don't call her name, you bastard! You raped my sister! What? It's true. You sniffed glue and did it with your friends! So my bastard of a father took the settlement money. That's why mom is raising her. Because you pity her! Isn't that true? Brother... don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry! I'll... go in now, mother... All of you! Just go back into my hole. I hope you all die. Brother... You're really... Mom's killing you because she loves you. She really... Because otherwise, I would kill you later. That's really funny. Brother... Brother... I some... sometimes... ...think... that... ...liv... living... ...might be death. ...and dying... ...might actually... ...be life. What shall I do? Seung-hyun's father... Seung-hyun's father... What shall I do? Seung-hyun's father... Seung-hyun's father... Mother! Uncle is on the phone. Okay, I'm going out now. Alright, alright. I'll call you later if anything happens. Mother, should I tell Ki-tae to put in a call to China? Should we? Let's wait a little more. It's just taking so long... Are the kids asleep? Yes. I think Ki-tae and Sung-il are sleeping upstairs. Did you go to Seung-hyun's room, too? Yes. Mother... Thank you for accepting a daughter-in-law like me. I'll do better from now on. Sure... You're already doing well. Why say such things? Who's as good as you? Such a thing to say... Brother! Brother! Second brother! Brother! What? Big brother is... He's not breathing... He's dead. He's not breathing. Yea? That's... that's good. Still... He went well. Should I tell mom? Yea, do that. Brother, there was no time before, so I couldn't tell you... But you were... You were really big-brother-like. Alright... Thank you. How did you do it? Did you do it well? Yes... We fixed him, and put him in the bag. Early morning, I think we can just get in the car. Get some sleep for now. What did uncle say? It's over in Yeo-ju... He'll send you the address. If you go to the construction site... ...and give them the bag, they'll take care of it. He's the foreman there. I heard he works on that 'Four Major Rivers Project.' That's an enormous project. Uncle says it's 100% certainty safe. Hey... What about the car? It's in the church parking lot, right? Yes, there's no problem there. Good. Our oldest son... Our second son... I don't know what I'd do without you. Easy, easy. - Gum? - It's okay. That's why I... That's why I bought one with wheels. Take a break. I'll do it. Mrs. Kim! It's been a while. It's me, elder Kim. It's been a while! Are you going on a family trip? What a pleasant sight! I met your eldest son yesterday! Ah, so you're the second son. Alrighty! Such a pleasant sight! I am praying very hard for you. I'm just coming out from early morning prayer. If I don't get an answer to my prayer for Mrs. Kim even once... ...then I don't leave the chapel. Very good... Well then! Have a good trip! Excuse me, elder... Lord, we are your chosen children, weak and young... ...hold them steadfast, and let them cooperate in love to perform good... Especially, we have a business man, the second son... No, wait! The eldest son... May you give him wisdom like Solomon's... And may his business prosper, so that it may be used for your kingdom... And our dear loving father... There is also a son with a deep illness who is bedridden. May your salvation give him a new lie. May you work through him, the miracle of Lazarus. So that this family here will be even more peaceful and blessed. May they lean on you, and depend on you more. As well, please protect Mrs. Kim's health. I pray all this in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. So! Let us clap to our Lord! Alrighty! Have a good trip, then! Mrs. Kim, may I... Mrs. Kim, I was meaning to give you a call... - You know the bar food I sell to King Club... - Sure, sure. They keep sending it back, who is it, that manager... Okay, I'll put in a call... Don't worry about it. Oh, I'm not worried! Thank you so much. - Hallelujah! - Thank you. Okay, let's go. Brother-in-law, I... I'm worried about something... Why did I... ...live with Sung-il, then... ...live with Ki-tae? If you were a normal person... You would have told Ki-tae and Sung-il not to live with me. Brother-in-law, I was really happy living with Sung-il. I wanted to have a kid, and get married... ...but Ki-tae... ...was so stubborn. I just wanted to convince him... That's why I met him that one time. I really didn't want to... Somehow I kept drinking... I just wanted to get his blessing... And Ki-tae kept pouring me drinks, so... I just went along and kept drinking. And then Ki-tae said 'Let's have a drink with Sung-il.' So I took a taxi, and then... I have no memory. Ki-tae... ...put a drug in the drinks, so... Ki-tae got some kind of... stimulant from China. ...he gave it to me, and forced himself on me... That's how it happened... But now... brother-in-law, I... My worry now is... I'm afraid it'll be revealed who my kid's father is. Actually... I don't know either. Even still... brother-in-law... Even still, I'm going to try hard. I'm going to be good to my kid, and... I'm going to be good to Ki-tae... I'm going to try hard.
