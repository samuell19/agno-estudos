(mechanical clattering) (air whooshing) (quirky music) (pleasant music) (children shouting) (raccoon squeaking) (raccoon chirping) (quirky music) (dramatic music) (couple screaming) - Let's break up! - Let's break up! - What? You're breaking up with me, babe? To hell with that, I'm breaking up with you! - I said it first, babe! - Clearly you're not happy and I don't even know why you're still living here if you just like hate it-- - What do you mean, I'm not happy? - So much! - I don't hate it so much! LA is just-- - You do hate it so much! All you ever talk about is how you hate it! - It's the worst place on this planet to raise a family, other than North Korea and Detroit. - You give all of your money to bums and I pay your rent, so I really don't understand how you could ever raise a baby! - Okay, you don't understand the plight of the common hobo. Bums need, no scratch that, deserve my support. - You know what, I'm totally done and over this. Been over it for awhile. - Fine, great. - You can just go. Okay. - Get out! - [Woman] Yep! - Get off my mountain! - Well! - You know, I've never seen a fashion designer with so little fashion sense. - What? - You wore overalls on our first date! - Those were a gift! Because, you know what, I get checked out a lot! I am still young and I am still sexy and a lot of people wanna date me and I don't know why I'm wasting my time with you. - You are older than me, Blair Witch! - That's not what the guys at the gym say. - What do they say? - Yep! They say it with their eyes. They think I look good. - They say it with their eyes? - Yeah, they do. - You carry mayonnaise around with you just in case. - Yeah, well, you listen to Christmas music all year round! - No man can save you! - No woman will have your freak baby! - I never wanna see you again! - Yeah, good! - Great! - Yep! - Yeah. - Yeah. - Good. - Great. (birds chirping) Do you know the way back? - No. Fuck. (pleasant music) (somber music) (glass clinking) - Hell yeah! Hell yeah! Hell yeah! (upbeat funk music) Hey, man, what're you doing? - Hey, thanks for helping me today. I knew you probably had better things to do. - Are you kidding me? I'm having a blast! This is the best day of my life! - Your life? - It's not even my birthday. Let's get the show on the road, let's go! Come on, will you lighten up? The bitch is finally gone. - I thought you liked her. - Motherfucker, you can't be serious! Shut up! Listen, man, that's what the homies do. We act like we like the girlfriend, like we can even stand the sight of her, until the time when the relationship dissolves. At that time, in case you ain't peeing now, you and I proceed to team up on the bitch and shit all over her memory! - Those things will kill you, you know. - Now what am I supposed to do? You guys are my best friends. - Why does it have to change? I mean, this is between Shawn and me. - Because I make such an awesome third wheel. What am I supposed to do? I'm no good alone. Then date, Ang. - Dating is stupid! Besides the regular sex, I don't see the point. Look at you. You're coming this close to shoving your head into an oven. - Okay, I don't know how it looked from the outside but-- - [Ang] Like shit, like horrible, horrible shit. - Okay, not all the time, you had to have seen-- - All the time! It's like watching two conjoined twins trying to climb up a water slide. - Thank you for your honesty. - I don't know, it feels weird. You know, like, she never even introduced me to her parents, and that should've been a sign. - Hey, hey, hey, buck up! Buck up, Shawn, buck up! - It should've been a sign. - Now that you're single again, we have a lot of bro time to catch up on. It's going down, baby! You with me, Shawn, come on! - A whole year wasted. - Hmmm. I know, right? This shit is the shit, right here! (guy laughing) Hell yeah! Hell yeah! Hell yeah! Come on, sister, we're losing daylight, come on! - Well, I guess this is it. - I guess it is. - Burn in hell, asshole. - Choke on a chicken bone, whore. - You wet blankets wanna get a bite to eat later? - They aren't hungry! - [Ang] Take it easy, guy. (pleasant music) (police siren alarming) (distant people shouting) - [Man] So, you're the new guy. Last one killed himself. - What? - Or he just moved out. - Um... I'm sorry, do you live here? - I'm called Ray. What are you called? Do you like movies? - Um... I'm kinda busy right now. - "The Sandlot" is my favorite. - [Lindsey] That's a good one. That's a classic. - Washing machine's broke. It's cool. You can use my washboard and bucket anytime. You an inventor? - No. I'm just trying to mount my new TV here, Ray. - I mean, I could help you put that up if you want, I'm-- - No, no. No, thank you. I don't need a man's help or yours. - I like your stripe shirt. Makes you look taller. It's hot in here. - Yeah, well, that's the valley for you. - You know what I'm talking about. Yoga. - Yeah. - Can I borrow that? - [Lindsey] Sure, go ahead. - [Ray] I don't sweat. - [Lindsey] Okay. - Apartment eight! Welcome, apartment eight! - [Lindsey] Thank you. - It's official. Part of the family. - [Lindsey] Namaste. - [Ray] Cucamonga! (baby crying) - Yeah, sorry guys, the meter's expired and plus I think there's a kid crying in your car. - This ticket says 63 dollars is the cost? - Yes, that's correct. Okay, and you can make that payment-- - No, my friend, no! This is not acceptable. This not work for me, my friend. - I'll tell you what. We make you a deal you cannot refuse. - What is my best price? We pay cash. - Best price, cash. - What? - I give you five dollars and we call it even, my friend. - [Shorter Man] Five dollars. - No, guys, okay, that's not the way it works, all right? So the city of Los Angeles requires-- - 20 dollars plus a t-sirt. What do you say? - How do you like this? It's good? Looking good. It's comfortable. - No, okay, so my boss would fire me. - No, you go to bank with this t-shirt. You go to bank. You sell on eBay in 10 years. - Save it. - [Taller Man] In 10 years. (man sniffing) - [Shorter Man] 10 years! - Look at me. My boss would fire me if I accepted that 20 dollars. - [Taller Man] And a t-shirt, look, look, my friend. - This is good business. You must learn to do good business. - No deal, guys. Sorry. Okay? It's the way it goes down. - [Woman] Is there a problem, Shawn? - [Taller Man] Are you the boss of this man? - I am, is everything okay? - No, they're trying to offer me a t-shirt and 20 dollars for their ticket. Yeah, obviously I did not accept. - Are you crazy? That is not good business, Shawn! Sorry guys, he's new. - You are a good man! - Thank you very much. Such a sweetheart. - My family thanks you. - Very fine man. Very fine, thank you. A sweet, fine man. (baby crying) Bye! - [Lindsey] I did it all by myself. Baller! - Huh. Looks like a picture that you can watch. (television rattling) (glass shattering) I offered my help. (melancholy music) (camera snapping) (camera snapping) (remote clicking) (quirky music) (Lindsey yelling) (Shawn groaning) - That's so lame! A real lady doesn't have sex with herself. - Okay, this is ridiculous. Don't wanna do it like that. It's not a pool cue. (playful music) - No! Not there! - Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. No, honest mistake. - We'll talk about it. - I hope you brought your pool cue! (Lindsey sighing) (Shawn sighing) (somber music) (crickets chirping) (Lindsey groaning) (cell phone clicking) (Shawn knocking) Let's go out! - Would you stop that? (Ang groaning) - I need a cigarette. I picked the wrong week to quit. After what I've just been through. - Oh, it could not have been that bad. I've seen African men with their pants down before. Remember that exhibit at the history museum. - Yeah, and this is just so average. I thought that I was reaching the final frontier of my sexual awakening with this dude and then... But, alas, I realized that this is just the beginning. The only thing left to do is to take it all the way. I'm talking sexing up some really, really foreign dudes. The deep cuts. - Your life is so weird. - You love it. - Are you sure about this place? Lindsey and I used to come here. - Look, man, it's been two weeks since she moved out of our place. That shit is done, son. Boom. Now you need to realize that you're finally single. Take all the pent up energy and focus it on some of these fine-ass hood rats up in here. (quirky music) - [Man] How do you work this contraption? (toilet flushing) (door thudding) - Oh. - Yeah, maybe you're right. - Plus, Lindsey couldn't be single if she took an excessive course. She's probably married by now. (Lindsey sighing) - Are you sure I should be showing my face in this place? I mean, Shawn could be here. - Nonsense. Shawn couldn't be single if he took an extensive course. He's probably married by now. Oh look, Shawn. Hey, Shawn! (Lindsey groaning) - Oh, for fuck sake. - What's the big deal? You guys were bound to run into each other eventually. - Yeah, I thought I'd have my life together by then, you know? I thought I'd be living in a nice house in the hills with my famous politician husband who completely supported my music career as I master the ukulele and then tour Eastern Europe with my all girl indie folk band, Lindsey and the Wailers. - Okay, what you need is a one-night-stand. If you're ever gonna get over this, something completely free of emotion attachment. - I'm not you, Ang, you know I can't do that. - If you don't get this monkey off of your back, how do you ever expect to be ready for a healthy relationship that might come your way? - You know what, maybe you're right. - [Ang] I am right. (Lindsey sighing) - Hey, guy. You wanna take me to pound town and then never speak to me again? - What's that now? - She's on the rebound, guy. Don't be a geek. Girls like confidence. - I don't follow. Am I on some kind of predator show here? - I don't think so. - Well, good, because I'm not a predator and if you're gonna question me any further, I suggest we have my lawyer present. - Well, he's great. Should I leave you two alone? - We just broke up and she's already hitting on bros. This is a nightmare. - Look, we're bringing back guy's night. Our apartment is gonna make a triumphant return this weekend and I'm inviting Tiffany. - That actor from "Glaciers of Alaska?" You don't even like him. - Yeah, but he's got the, you know, found a rash or something on his pinky toe. Now he's all paranoid like he's got cancer or something. I figured we'd throw him a bone, you know? - I hear cancer's a pretty bad disease. - [Joe] When it's real, yeah. - One second you're here and then the next, you're just another pinky toe cancer victim on the chopping block. Life is so short. - Good point. I'm gonna fuck with him. I'm gonna fuck with him. - Okay. - I'll fuck with him. - Is it different than fucking? - [Joe] Yeah, a little bit. (upbeat rock music) (intense music) ("Jingle Bells" radio music) (Lindsey and Shawn moaning) (Lindsey and Shawn breathing heavily) - Oh my God. (Shawn huffing) This is just like old times. - Oh, we still got it. (Shawn laughing) - Kind of. (Shawn huffing) - Oh. (Lindsey and Shawn huffing) ("Jingle Bells" instrumental music) - Well now that we've got that out of our system we can-- - Clean break! - Yeah. - Right? - So-- - Because I don't wanna stop you form getting out there and, you know, like, finding your happiness. - Yeah. I, same with you. I just, all I want is for you to be happy, you know? And I feel like there are like tons of girls out there that would be super lucky to have you. Like, the luckiest. - Yeah, thanks. - You're welcome. ("Jingle Bells" instrumental music) - Fourth meal? - Oh hell yeah! (engine rumbling) (tires screeching) (car horn honking) - [Man] Asshole! - I just think that a makeup pouch, you know, and it doesn't have to be for make up, mind you. It can be fore anything else, we'll just add, you know, a level of versatility to the line. - [Man] Girl, we have been over this, and frankly, this convo is way past its self life. - Okay, but-- - You do no design purses! You design hip satchels at the prestigious and respected Sir Franklin Philadelphia III and Associates and I do not need to remind you that there are literally billions of hot, young, fresh designers... (man sighing) fresh young men, right out of college that would drink Versace's embalming fluid to be where you are right now! - Okay, I know. - Now get back to work! These gems don't adhes themselves! (sewing machine buzzing) - [Ang] This place is so gay. (phone ringing) - [Woman] Hello. Sir Franklin Philadelphia III and Associates. - Ang. - I'm Janine. Your challenge coordinator. - What is that? - What? - [Lindsey] I thought you quit! - I only smoke after sex now, okay? It's one step at a time. - It is truly. We made passion for love. It was the best night of my life. (sewing machine buzzing) - What's with you? - Uh... Okay. So big news. Headline type stuff. - [Ang] Spill it! - Um... Here it goes. I had a one-night-stand. (Ang screaming) - Sorry. (Lindsey giggling) - I didn't think I had it in me. - [Ang] His dick? - Whatever, no, got to have a one-night-stand. - Oh. (Ang laughing) - I see that you are friends. It would be my honor to ask you for Angela's hand in marriage. - So who was your guy? - Oh, you know. It's no one you know, so. (quirky music) - Wait a minute. Not Shawn. Don't tell me you mashed genitals with your ex! That is not a one-night-stand, you dummy! - Why? - It's a backslide! You two are back together. - No, no, no, okay? Absolutely not, absolutely not. It was just a one time thing. We have an understanding, so-- - This is great! We gotta do something. Come on, I want details! (quirky music) - Is there a bus stop around here? (man sniffling) (upbeat bongo music) (people chattering) - Everything satisfactory, folks? - This may be the best Mexican dish I've ever had. Very authentic. - I'm very delighted to hear that. You know, we handpick the best chefs from below the border. Enjoy. You guys are shit! They hate y'all motherfucking ass out there! Now you pull your head out of his ass and cook some goddamn decent food! These people didn't pay to die tonight! (food sizzling) - Ebeneezer Swartzberger from "The Stomach" is checking us out in a couple of weeks. Gotta keep these fools on their toes, you know what I mean? - "The Stomach?" Is that that reality TV show with those inbred rednecks that go from restaurant to restaurant an eat everything on the menu in one sitting as they have these wacky conversations that bring out their ignorance? All the while, there's this beautiful and intelligent host/scientist that chronicles their digestive passage? - No, it's a food magazine. - Oh, that's neat. - Yeah, if it goes good I'll finally get that loan to open up my restaurant, meat loaf and waffles, like we talked about-- - Yeah. - With gravy? Hoes everywhere dancing? It's about to go down. - Yeah, buddy. - Yeah, son, you know how we roll, boy! Yeah. Yeah. (phone buzzing) - Oh, sorry. - [Joe] Who is that? - Oh, it's no one you know. - You got a new girl? Do I know her? - You might. - Is it Shakwanda? - No. - Man, give me that phone. - What? - Something's fishy here, give me that phone. - No, it's just some broad man, I'm telling you. - Give me the phone, Shawn! We both know you can't talk to new girls. Give me the phone! - I'm gonna hang on to it. - You... Give me the phone! (Shawn groaning) - There are people around. - Hand me the phone, man! (Shawn and Joe yelping) (upbeat bongo music) (Shawn groaning) - [Shawn] No! No! (Shawn yelping) - [Joe] Give me the phone! - [Shawn] Let go of me! This is weird! - Yah! I knew it, man, Lindsey? Sellout! - All right, there, you happy? Yes, we've connected, Jesus. - [Joe] Oh, so now y'all back together? - No, absolutely not. It was like a onetime thing, that's it. - It's never a one time thing, man. Once you find the 7-Eleven is open 24 hours, you always go back for a late night Slurpee, or in this case, pussy! You maggots get your shit together! Get my food right! Get it right! Get back to work, I said! (upbeat bongo music) - I thought it was really good, guys. (food sizzling) You guys speak English? (upbeat music) (waves whooshing) (seagulls squawking) - You guys having fun? - Yeah. (ocean waves whooshing) - How about you, Asian tourist? Are you having fun? - Yes, yes, fun! (camera snapping) - He's so adorable. I think his family fell into a volcano or something. - [Tourist] Hollywood! So beautiful! - So, how's the new apartment? Word on the street is you got a new plasma? - Yeah. The thing just really comes out at you. Even when you don't want it to sometimes. - You're in Burbank now. That's kinda fucking boring, right? And hot? - It's not that hot. Anyways, whatever. I'm fine, it's great. The people there are more mature, you know? Like have their lives together a little bit and that's kinda the direction that I'm going, so-- - I am loving the extra real estate in my sleep machine. Sometimes I just go naked under my sheets, spread eagle style, and I pretend I'm a bag of trash floating downstream to Valhalla. - Great. - It's wonderful. - Well, I'm thinking about adopting a puppy. Not because I'm lonely. - No. - It's just, I want a puppy. - No, of course not. - And when did, when did animals get associated with lonely people nursing misplaced emotions and emptiness? Just going on tons of dates with, you know-- - Me too. - One of the guys is a trainer. - I'm dating a trainer too. - Oh, really? - We're not dating. Like, she comes and goes. You know, T.M.I. - That's good. Listen, I just wanna handle this like adults, you know? I just wanna be adult about-- - The sex has been great for me. I have like a cycle of women coming to my place. - Oh really? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah, see, the thing is, your mom called me and she said she's really worried. So I just wanted to make sure you're okay because the loneliness has hit you pretty hard. - [Shawn] I think you're joking right now. - No, I'm serious. She has my number. - My mom called you? - Yeah. Are you okay? - [Shawn] Yeah, tell her I'm fine. I'll call her. - Okay. (ocean waves sloshing) - [Ang] Give me that thing. Let's get a picture. (Ang laughing) (camera snapping) Stop it. - You seem happy. - Totally. - Totally. - So fun. - The single life. - Yeah, the single life. - Doing it solo. - Totally solo. - Mm-hmm. Just... Just yourself and you. - Just-- - Me and myself and I. - Single night dates with yourself. - Loving it. - I love it so much. - [Ang] So like what's your favorite color? (tourist speaking foreign language) - [Tourist] So delicious. - [Ang] You're the cutest. (Lindsey and Shawn sexually moaning) (ocean wave splashing) - I mean, just so we're clear, we're not, this doesn't mean we're dating. - No. No, no, no, no. - Okay. - No. We're not... This is like a friends with benefits type situation. - Yeah. It's like, we're like fuck buddies. - Yeah, like, blow brothers. - Coitus companions. - Pussy partners. - Hump homies. - Ass-ociates! Ass is anything. They can work together. - That doesn't work because what're you doing to my ass? - Ass-ociates! - Doesn't really work. (Lindsey laughing) (upbeat music) So, do you think maybe like later you'd wanna, you'd wanna hang out sometime? - Oh. Okay. - I mean, as friends, just as friends. - What do you have in mind? - Oh, well, we're having a movie night. You know, movies, underwear, food. - What do you think Big Joe would think about that? - Goddamn I hate this! Just me and my boys tonight. Ain't no dumb bitch gonna mess up my evening! No, sir! Looks like Topher Grace is on, son! (upbeat funk music) - This is great, Joe. I wanna thank you for letting me hang out with you guys. Real friends are a treasure I don't take lightly. - Hey man, you're gonna die soon. Painfully too, according to your doctor. I figure hanging out with you can't be as bad as what you're going through, you know? - Thank you for saying that. - Hey, when you gonna shave your head anyway? - Shave my head? - Yeah, it's part of the chemo thing. Hey, I think you'd look pretty dope. Cut your hair, be balled, you know, get some ink going on. - Really? - Aw, shit, you ready? I got my famous homemade nachos. I got our favorite classic movies. It's on, son! - And no pants, I see. You got the Tifter to show off his bulge, nice job. - Yeah, I was meaning to ask about that. Would you mind if I put my pants back on? - Never. Speaking of which, you seem a little bit overdressed for the occasion. - Oh, I... I wasn't sure if it was appropriate. - Appropriate? What you mean appropriate? We never wear pants when we do this. - Well, I, I invited someone else to join us. - You did what? Who? I say, who? - You're gonna be mad. (gunshots booming on television) - Goddamn it, Tiffany, can you scooch over a bit? - Sorry. - [Man On TV] Take a 10 minute break. (bone cracking on TV) - Oh come on, seriously? Arms don't even break like that. - You wanna find out? - No, I'm just saying like, if he was a cop, he'd be behind bars by now. It's just like, he's worse than all the criminals. - That's what makes it so awesome. Because he's so badass that the law can't even contain him. - Yeah but it's just really unrealistic, you know? - You know what, I wouldn't expect somebody from your generation to understand. Hey, let's go watch "Jazz Train." Shawn, will you tell this girl? - About? I mean, it is kinda ridiculous, like the whole plot. - Yeah. Like what plot, you know? - Yeah, a little bit. (Shawn laughing) - You know? (Lindsey laughing) - Yeah, I guess. - [Man On TV] We break necks and cash checks! But the bank is closed due to Columbus Day. (quirky music) (mayonnaise gurgling) - Oh, that's it! I'm out! - Joe! Come on! (door thudding) - Did I? - No. - Hey, how do you guys think I'd look with some new ink? - Um... (rooster crowing) (gunshot booming) (pleasant instrumental music) - Hey, what, what're you doing? - [Joe] Is she gone? - Yeah, yeah, she's gone, weirdo. (Joe slurping) - So how far is this thing gonna go? - What do you mean? Oh! (toast crunching) - Look, you seem like a nice kid. Let me help you out. This girl's clock is ticking, she's ready to have kids, man. She's perfect for you! Ask Tyrell and Darius, they hit that too. Ethan hit it. She waiting on your car, I already told her. Man, just promise me you'll stop fucking with that bitch though! You killing me, man! Look, I'll do anything. I'll let you play Christmas music anytime you want to. - Wait, wait, you're scaring me. - Listen, I'll let you call me the N-word, man! - Whoa! (Shawn chuckling) - I don't want, I don't wanna call you that. I don't wanna call you any N-word. I don't wanna call you the N-word. - Man, I need this. - You need this? (eggs squelching) Joe! - Promise! (Shawn yelping) - Fine, I promise! I promise, all right? But for the record, this encounter has made me feel incredibly bullied. - Thanks for breakfast. (Joe farting) - You're welcome. (dogs barking) - Wow. I knew that orphaned animals were treated poorly but I was not mentally prepared for this. - Yeah, I see this kinda thing on the web. These cute little guys are being shamed. (dramatic piano music) - Every one of those signs is true. (dogs barking) Can I help you? - Hi, we were thinking about rescuing a pet. A dog. - For real? You sure? - Yeah, why? Is there a problem? - Yeah, maybe it's best we just let 'em sit here till the law lets me put 'em down. Best thing for everybody. You know what I mean? - Um. - Um. - Take this one, for instance. (dog whimpering) He's the worst! Always barking. Chewing up your work documents when you're not looking. - I'm pretty sure he's just sitting there being adorable. - It's a facade! Don't be a fool! - What about that one? She looks the most starved for love thing I've ever seen. - Daddy issues. Found her on Crenshaw giving handies for kibble. (cat meowing) (Shawn gasping) - What do you think? I never really fancied myself a cat person but-- - Yeah but he looks really great. What's his name? - That's Moron. He's getting the chair tomorrow. 100 thousand watts. (ominous music) - [Shawn] Like an electric chair? - My greatest achievement. After years in development, finally, curiosity is gonna dispense justice. (dogs barking) - Yeah, can we have like just a moment? - I guess. - Okay. (ominous music) (dogs barking) - I don't know, we have to do something. We can't leave these animals with him. - What're we supposed to do? We can't take them all home. (exciting beat music) (latches clicking) (dogs growling) - Hey! Hey, what're you going? You can't do that! Hey! (dog snarling) - Oh hey. Nice stray. I almost liked you. No! (man yelling) (cloth tearing) I knew this day would come! Do your worst, you sons of bitches! - That was fun. - Yeah. (cat meowing) - What do you say to like a real date night? - I'd say, date night is a great night. (cat meowing) - [Lindsey] Yes it is. (upbeat music) (children shouting) - Weed? You want some weed? - Oh, no thank you, I don't smoke. - You want some weed? - Oh, you know what, actually, that last drug salesman already got me. Thank you, though, I appreciate it. Good pitch. A+. (upbeat music) - Sup, sup? - Sup, dawg? (pleasant music) (children shouting) - How's it going today? - You know, it's going really well, thank you. Nobody has asked me that. - Oh really? - Yeah. - Yeah, that's too bad. - Thank you, yeah. - That's too bad. - Yeah. - You want some weed? - Is anybody in this park not a drug dealer? - Mommy, I'm scared. - Hey! (frisbee smacking) - Yeah, I don't think so. - How do you guys get away with that stuff? Isn't it illegal? - What, are you kidding me? This is California. Everything is legal. - Yeah? - Yeah. Besides, it makes you look cool. - Let's get fucked up! (electric guitar sliding) (pleasant music) (ominous drums rumbling) (Joe groaning) (distant bombs booming) ♪ I can't be yours ♪ ♪ Anymore ♪ (car horn honking) - [Man] Asshole! - Thank you. (people clapping) (people chattering) - Thanks for coming, guys. I always feel like I have to pressure my friends into coming to these things. So it means a lot. Thanks. Did you guys wanna stick around for some more? - Can I get you anything, shnookums? - Nope. All I need it my boo. (Shawn giggling) - There's a taco truck up the street if you guys are feeling it. I hear it's rat free. - What do you think, babe? It's your choice, babe. - No, it's your choice, it's your day, babe. Anything you want. - Anything? (Lindsey and Shawn giggling) God, you're so cute. - Oh, God, I think it should be illegal for you to be so sweet to me. - You gonna arrest me? - [Lindsey] Oh yeah, I'm gonna arrest you. - Muy bien. - [Angie] I hear you guys are pretty official again. Huh? That's cool. - [Shawn] I love you so much. - Nope, I love you more. - You know, that's impossible. The way I feel for you right now is beyond anything anyone's ever felt before about a human person. - Oh, the way I feel for you right now is beyond anything anyone has ever felt for anything or any person or otherwise. And this incudes my Uncle Rob and his love for Camaros and my Auntie Annette and her love for crack. - Ugh. - I wanna kiss you to death. - Oh, I just wanna take a saw and just saw through your body and then just jump inside and just eat all your internal organs for breakfast. - I'm gonna grab the back of your head and just punch your teeth down your throat because I can't live without you. (Lindsey giggling) (people chattering) (entry bell ringing) - [Man] Uh... Hello. (group yelling) (intense rock music) - Yeah! Yeah! (intense rock music) (Lindsey moaning) - Don't! - What? - Are you kidding me? - Here. - No. (cat hissing) (Lindsey and Shawn mumbling) - [Woman] Oh my God! Shawn? - Lauren? Wow, hi. - Hi, it's good... It's so good to see you. - You too! - How have you been? - [Shawn] I've been, I've been, I've been fine. Nothing special. How about you? - Great. I just got a promotion. I have a new house. I'm a real grownup now. (Shawn chuckling) - Wow, that's so great. It's so good to see you. - Is this your girlfriend? - Oh yeah. (Shawn chuckling) Yeah, this is my girlfriend, Lindsey. Lindsey, this is Lauren. - Wow, so this is Lauren. This is the Lauren. - Seems I'm a bit more famous than I realized. - No. She just, I told her that I had a girlfriend named Lauren. - Yeah, he just told me he had a girlfriend named Lauren, you know, who moved with him to Los Angeles from Scottsdale and some other stuff. - All good things, I hope. - Oh, all... things, for sure, yeah. - [Man] Senior, your shit is ready. - That's our food. I guess we gotta... So good to see you and talk with you again. I'm glad you're doing well. - [Lauren] You should give me a call, Shawn, and we can catch up sometime. - [Shawn] Okay. Oh yeah, for sure. Yeah. - [Lauren] It was really nice seeing you. - [Shawn] You too, really nice seeing you. - It was really nice meeting you. - Yeah. - You guys enjoy your food. - Thanks. You too. If you're having food. She's, she's... That was crazy. Oh, the food, yeah, thanks, I got it. - That was so crazy. Are you gonna be okay? - What? Yeah, no, I'm fine. - You gonna make it home? You're a little flustered. - [Shawn] I can't tell if you're making fun of me. (cat meowing) Are you mad? - She's pretty. - Who? - Your girlfriend, Lauren. She's... She's really pretty. - Ex-girlfriend? I haven't seen her since we met and I don't plan on ever seeing her again. - Yeah, but what made her so special? I mean, you left all of your family and all of your friends to follow her out here and then she just leaves you with nothing. - Yeah, there is that. But... I don't know, like she was my first love, so, that kind of thing doesn't just go away. But you are my last love. - [Lindsey] Really? - [Shawn] Isn't that good? Yeah? - Okay, I'll take it. (pleasant guitar music) - Hey, guys. (Shawn yelping) (cat screeching) - Hey. - Better watch his wandering eyes, huh? (Ray chuckling) (cat meowing) What's, what's shaking? Wanna play Scrabble? We should go out sometime, me and you. Hang out. - [Shawn] I-- - Get to know each other. - [Lindsey] Yeah, Shawn, bond. - What? - Wow, what's your sleep number? You're a 75. I can tell. All right. (keys jingling) Can I take it for a spin? - Oh yeah, you know where it is. - I'll have it back by morning. Have a good night you two. (door thudding) - What the fuck? (upbeat rock music) (Lindsey huffing) - You know, Linds, I didn't always have the world quite so pinned. There was a time when I was just as lost and as hopeless as you. - Oh yeah? - True story. Wasn't until I found Christ that my life did a total 180. - You are not religious. - I know. Julia Christ. She's my therapist. - [Man] Oh yeah. - Okay, thank you but I don't need a therapist, okay? And me and Shawn are fine. No, you know, we're better than fine. We are great. - You just told me you have him a key to your apartment. - Yeah. - That is fucked up, dude! (man groaning) - What happened to you being the perfect third wheel? Okay, I thought you said you supported us. - I do support you. Coddling your happiness is easily one of my favorite daily priorities. It's up there with getting at least three hours of sleep at night steam cleaning my linens. - Wow, okay, well I don't really understand your change of tone now that me and Shawn are back together. - I don't know. Maybe it was last night's sickening display of affection. I now realize it is a matter of tick-tocks before that sugarcoated front breaks down revealing the unforgiving beast within that devours us all! - Excuse me? (man groaning) I'm not the one who needs dating advice, okay? You just sleep with unique guys from foreign lands for some stupid bucket list quest. You're the one who needs to grow up, Ang. - That's not fair. - Well. - Accurate, sure. But not fair. (man groaning) Guy! Is the grunting really necessary? Knock it off! I don't need this! I'm going outside for a smoke break. - What? I thought you quit. - I only smoke when I work out now. (man groaning) (bone cracking) (man yelling) - Shawn, I never thought a hoe would come between us, man. - You said I could have this. - And I don't even, you know what, go ahead, you can have the hoe! Keep the hoe! That's what you do, you keep hoes. - All right. This isn't about the hoe, is it? It's about Lindsey. - Man, you think moving in together is gonna solve your shit? It's gonna make it worse. - Nothing's changed, man, okay? I love her. So we're moving in together. - Hey, what do you guys know about Botox injections? - What hurts? - Well, Big Joe's been helping me leave behind my legacy. - Hell yeah. - I've even done some acting. - Oh, hell yeah. Hey, tell him about those karate classes you been taking. Got into some shit down in the hood, had to sign my boy up. - What kind of acting have you been doing? - Well I acted like I supported your relationship with that... That wench. (intense music) - So that's how you feel? I thought you liked us together. - You know, you could learn a few things from me, Shawn. As I keep reaching for the stars, you keep falling further and further backward. Frankly, it's pathetic. - Cancer's changed you, man, and not for the better. - And to think, I was gonna let that fool call me the N-word. - Can I call you the N-word? - Fuck you, Tiffany. (truck engine rumbling) (tires screeching) (glass shattering) (upbeat music) - This is the last of it. - Here, give me that. Yeah. - It's hot. You know, Burbank is pretty nice. Kinda reminds me of home. - Hm. Told you. - Is it cool that I'm parked on the street? - Oh, look who's asking. (Shawn chuckling) - This is gonna be really nice. - Yeah, I know. Makes me wonder why we didn't just do it sooner, you know? - [Shawn] I don't know. (upbeat music) - Babe, what the heck? - Sorry, sorry, babe. - Get out, I'm trying to poop! - Okay. (door thudding) - Wow. - Yeah. - Good job. - What do you think of that? - Oh. - You got it. (television creaking) - Tot-- (glass shattering) (upbeat music) - Babe! What did we say about putting our toothbrushes away when we're done with them? - [Lindsey] Shawn! (whistling ringtone) (upbeat music) (car horn honking) (television commotion) - Hey, babe. - Shawn! Lock the door. - You never lock the door. - Yeah, well, it's my house. - It's my house now too or did you forget? I live her and I don't like locks anymore than you do. - Okay, yeah, well a real man wouldn't let his lady see him like this. - Yeah, well, do you think it's a picnic for a guy to walk in on his woman shitting three times a day? That's sick, man. - That is a natural human bodily function, okay? And you know what, I am sorry if I haven't gotten used to this whole thing as quickly as you would have liked. - It is hot as shit in the valley. You promised me the temperature here would be inoffensive. - Okay, well I don't control global warming, okay? So buy a fan, asshole! - This is stupid. I knew this wasn't gonna work. - You knew? I knew! I told you us getting back together was a bad idea. - I meant us moving in so soon together. Do... Do you think it was a mistake to get back together? (dramatic music) - Don't you? (water plopping) - It is great to meet you, Shawn and Lindsey. I'm Julia. - Hi, Julia. - Hi, Julia. - Let's get right to the healing, shall we? (Julia laughing) - [Shawn] Okay. - How long have you two been married? - Ha! - Oh. - We're not married. (clock ticking) - Ah. Okay. Well then, how many children do you have? - We don't have children, Julia. - [Julia] I'm sorry, did you say no children, as in you don't have kids? - That is correct. - Interesting. - This next question's gonna be for you, Lindsey. How long have you been sleeping with your brother, Shawn, here? - I'm sorry, what? - Well, I put the pieces together. How long have you been having sex with your brother, Shawn? - Um, we are not brother and sister. - Oh. - [Lindsey] We're dating. - I am so sorry. - [Lindsey] Yeah. - My mistake. - Kind of an odd assumption to make. - Do you live together? - [Shawn] We do, actually. - Okay, now we're on to something. Pets? - Oh yeah, we have a cat. I actually brought a picture. His name is Moron. - Here's a, I mean, if you want a better picture. It's bigger, so... No, I was just saying, it's clearer, better picture. I really love him to death. - I don't know why we always have to compete. It's like-- - I wasn't competing. - It's very exhausting. - It's easier to see. It's easier to see. - Why don't you two just break up? - I'm sorry? - Excuse me. - This is LA. You'll find plenty of people who are compatible with both of you. - Okay, thank you. - Yeah, I think we're done. - We should just-- - No, you know, no, no, no. Just sit back down, relax. You've called my bluff. Let's start over, shall we? Tell me how you two met. - Um... - Well... - Okay. - Come on, you can do it. - [Lindsey Voiceover] The day we met, it was such a beautiful LA day. (car horn honking) - [Man] Asshole! - [Shawn Voiceover] The world was unforgiving and cold but at least we looked good. You know, I woke up that morning and I had my ass hurt so bad. I tried to walk it off. - [Lindsey Voiceover] What? - [Shawn Voiceover] I was wet? - [Lindsey Voiceover] I mean, I told you to go. - [Shawn Voiceover] I was wondering how you knew I was wet. - [Lindsey Voiceover] Babe, stop talking about sex. - [Shawn Voiceover] My girlfriend had just left me high and dry after we moved here from Scottsdale to begin our new life together. I swore she was the one. - [Lindsey Voiceover] I just found out my divorced parents had gotten divorced again, for the third time each. I swore love was a curse. But nothing was gonna stop me from getting to the annual local bake sale. Those kids make a mean cookie. - [Shawn Voiceover] Yeah, my head was nowhere. You know, it was in the clouds. I was just... Kinda just vacant. I didn't even see the midget that walked by us. - And then... - And then... - I saw him. - I saw her. Oh! - Oh. Sorry. You should go. - Ladies first. - No, I'm not even a lady, that's silly. - You're a lady. - Okay, well, I am a girl. - Yeah, I'm a man. (Shawn laughing) - I'm not one of those girls you just like let go first. Like, I can drive a stick shift. Like, I know how to read a car manual. - I'm in full appreciation of that, so after you. I insist. Right now. - I like your hair. Maybe we should just go at the same time. - Same time. - Okay, same time. - Agreed. - Yeah, let's go at the same time. - [Shawn] Deal. - Sold out! - Ow! - You're gonna have to vacate the premises, please. Thank you! Next time, get here earlier! (door thudding) (locks clicking) - Fourth meal? - Oh, hell yeah. And the rest is history. You know, as they say. - You know, you're even more beautiful now than when we met. - Oh God. I wanna introduce you to my parents... at dinner. - Really? I would love that! And I promise no baby talk. I won't push you until you're ready. - Okay. And I think I'm going to dress up real nice. - Okay. And I got the tab. Don't even think about tipping. - Okay. Wow, thank you, Julia, I think we're, I think we're cured. - Yeah, thank you so much, you were fantastic. - Oh, you're welcome. But, you know, just something takes over me, I guess, when I sit in this chair. (pleasant music) So you'll be breaking up then. (food sizzling) (people chattering) (upbeat bongo music) - No bullshit tonight, man! - What, yeah, of course. - No, I mean it! I don't need you fools hollering and making a scene or whatever it is y'all call love. Man, that magazine dude is here tonight. My career is on the line. - Okay. - It took me two weeks to get this place ready! - I swear, I didn't know tonight was your big night. Don't worry, your place looks great! I barely even recognize it. And I love our table, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way in the back. Wish me luck. (Joe groaning) (silverware clinking) Triple date night is a triple great night. Am I right? (man moaning) I hear this place is the best. By the way. Fantastic. Five on yelp. I'm gonna try a chip. (Shawn chuckling) Oh, those chips are dynamite. You guys dig in. - So Shawn, what is it you do for a living? - Yeah, well-- - Shawn works for the city, Daddy. - Oh! Like a judge? - No, not exactly. I enforce parking laws. - O-M-G, those guys suck! - You're a meter maid, Shawn? - [Shawn] Yes, ma'am. - Yeah, but Shawn was actually thinking about going back to school, right, honey? - Yeah, well-- - School good! - [Mother] Silence, Jean Claude. - Well, really, I mean, Lindsey is the career oriented one. You know, she's going to be the real breadwinner of the household. - [Lindsey] I do okay. - I just want a baby. (Lindsey laughing) (Shawn laughing) - He's kidding. - [Shawn] But what, I am? - I just, I feel like maybe this is a conversation you and I should have in private. - You're considering adoption? - Nope. No, I wish to impregnate your daughter with my seed. (mother laughing) - Good luck with that! (parents laughing) - [Lindsey] Mom. - Wait, what? - No. - What do you mean? - Well, well, Lindsey's barren. Her eggs are scrambled, darling. (mother laughing) - I love scrambled eggs. (upbeat bongo music) - Hun, you haven't told him? - Is this... Is this true? You can't have kids? - I'm sorry, Shawn. - You knew this whole time that I wanted kids and you didn't say anything? We said no more secrets! (people gasping) - Oh, and what about Lauren, huh? I bet she'd have your little monster! - I don't want Lauren, all right? We don't even talk anymore! - I know you've texted her! What do you think, I'm stupid? - Okay, yes, I texted her because it was her quarter birthday, okay? And then the next time was Flag Day. Her family celebrates Flag Day, I don't know! - You never loved me, Shawn! - You just thought that eventually I would give you a kid and that's all you ever loved! - That's not true and don't turn this around on me! - I want you out of my house! You are unfit to live with other humans! - Why don't you just admit the only reason that we got back together was because you're too scared to be alone? - Ha! - Which I can see now runs in your family. - Oh, do not bring my weird family into this! - I don't wanna live in your stupid house, all right? You know what, Big Joe was right. The closer I get to you, the worse off I am. - Fine! Fine! Maybe we're just not compatible. Maybe I just should've hooked up with some random tail and moved on! - Everyone was right but us, I guess. - [Lindsey] Everyone was right but us! - This is so stupid! - [Lindsey] Stupid! - [Shawn] We're so stupid! - So stupid! (glass shattering) - Dear, did you bring my blow? (food sizzling) - [Joe] What? I knew it! (doorbell ringing) Who the fuck is it? Goddamn! - Hi. We're Mister and Misses Kowalski, you must be Joe. - Is Tiffany home? (birds chirping) - [Tiffany] Mom? Dad? - Tiffles, is that you? (quirky music) - I didn't know you guys were coming by. What day is it? - Oh, honey, we've had this visit planned for months now. Don't you remember? - No shit, for real? - Yes, honey. - Oh man, I must've forgot. I've been so busy. - Gosh, golly, son, is... Is that? - Ganja, yeah man. - Marijuana? - Yeah, it's cool. It's good shit too from BC. Wanna hit? - Oh, Tiffany, what has happened to you? - No, no, no, no, Mom, it's cool. It's legal here. - See, you upset your mother. Now put that away. - Oh, lay off it, Pa. (somber music) (hand smacking) What do you guys wanna do today? You wanna go to the Hollywood sign? Disneyland? Canter's Deli? - That's it! - What? - We didn't give you money so that you could spend it on narcotics and ladies of the night. We gave it to you so that you could get settled and pursue your dreams. - I'm working hard out here and I'm finally happy, okay? I am never going back to what I was before! - Working hard? You're a junkie! Come on, Mother, we're going home. (mother crying) This was a bad idea. - [Tiffany] You know what, fine, leave! See if I care! (somber music) - Yikes. Hey. - What you doing here? - You weren't returning my calls. - That's because you fucked me, man! That little circus you put on at the restaurant cost me my loan! - I'm so sorry about that, man, really. Can I please just stay here until I figure out what to do? I would sleep in my car but they toed it. - So you walked 30 miles across Los Angeles in the middle of the night? Why didn't you just get a motel? - Because I'm broke! Can I just stay on the couch, please? - The couch has bedbugs. - [Shawn] All right, I'll sleep on the floor. - The floor has bedbugs. - Okay. My bedroom? - No, no, no, that's where Tiffany's bitches reside because that's what a real man does. He doesn't turn his back on his best friend. Man, I was just trying to help you! That girl wasn't even right for you! You're too blind you didn't see it! I'm your best friend! (dramatic music) And it has bedbugs. (dramatic music) (hand smacking) (crickets chirping) (man coughing) - [Angie] Linds, another day like this and you could start developing bedsores! - Oh my God, I feel so fat. (Lindsey crying) (water sloshing) - Look. - [Angie] You're still coming to my b-day party tomorrow, right? - No, I told you I'm not going, okay? I don't even have a date. - Don't even sweat it, I'm your date, go with me. - Thank you for being so cool through all this. - We're best friends. I love you. You know that. - I know. (water sloshing) Maybe I should just be a lesbian, you know? Like wear pantsuits and change my own oil. That's the life. - I hear you. I've learned that all men are the same. - The same! It doesn't matter where they're from. - [Lindsey] The same! - They're all the same. (quirky music) (water sloshing) (upbeat music) (girls groaning) - God. - We are really complicated. Like, I never realized how much work this is. - Can you lift this leg? (girls groaning) Pretzels. Is this... (Lindsey laughing) Is this what they do? - Close it! - Just go hard! - Well close it, okay, okay! You are picky! - Can you move up this way because I just really can't seem to get-- - Okay. - Up, up in there. (Angie groaning) And I... - Turn. But stay tight with it. - Okay. - Okay. Let's get real, let's get serious. - Okay, I'm ready. - It's just weird. I can't get in the spirit. - God, you are so soft. - Oh, thank you. - What kind of moisturizer do you use? - This is stupid! - Tell me a little bit. - These sheets are magnificent. - Yeah, they're Egyptian cotton. 12 hundred. - Wow. I'm cramping! (Angie groaning) - Okay, I'm-- - Uh-uh. - This isn't working. - This just is not for me. - Can we just call it? - Yeah, I'm out. Ugh. - So? - No, this does not count as a one-night-stand. (Lindsey groaning) - God, I'm having sex tomorrow night without emotions if it kills me! - Go get 'em, tiger. (Lindsey huffing) (Lindsey and Angie sighing) It's fucking hot in here. (exciting beat music) (people chattering) - Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You can't take pictures of this. - Oh? - No. - How about you? - All right, get in here. - A lot of fine hoes at this party. - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm, I'm going in. (upbeat music) - Angie, this is a phenomenal party. - That's so true. - I just can't believe your roommates were like chilling with it, you know? - Totally chill! There they are now! - Good turnout! - Hi, honey! - Hey! Maybe you should slow down a bit. - I shoulda shaved my legs. - You don't need to, okay? You look hot tonight. Any of these guys here would be happy to stick it in you one time and never call you again. - Do you really think so? - I know so. - You're right. - I am right. - I'm so, I'm hot. I'm above average. - Yes, way above. - Way above average. - Slightly above. - I'm doing it, doing that one. - Smile a little bit. - I'm gonna get this one. - You got this. - I'm smiling. - Get my freak on. - Hey, hey, hey! - Hey. - [Lindsey] You wanna, you wanna groove out there? - Whoa. Right over there? - Yeah, just like in, you know? - [Man] Not really feeling this. - [Lindsey] God, do you wanna bang me or not? - Have a good time. - Seriously? That did not, that was not my best. - Good attempt. You gotta scale back a bit because you come on hard and that's never cool. - I'm a little passionate. - You're fishing, you know? - Yeah, it's like you gotta wait. - It's not a hundred meter sprint. - Yeah. - You got this. - They're little fish. Shifty. I don't need to swim for anyone. - Oh my God. - What? - Did you know he was bringing a date? - [Lindsey] I knew it! - Is that his ex-ex-girlfriend? - That's a classic backslide. - Classic. - [Lindsey] He could've pissed me off and killed him. - Sad little man. - I'm gonna go throw up my carrots. - Whose birthday is this again? There's a lot of weirdos here. - A lot of weirdos, yeah. Angie certainly has a type. (Lauren chuckling) Pâté? - Mmmm, I'm gonna pass. - No problem. (Lauren chuckling) Can I ask you a question? - [Lauren] Of course. - Cool. Why did you ask me to move here with you? - I loved you and I wanted you to be with me. - Yeah? - [Lauren] Yeah. - Yeah but what about me? - What do you mean? I had a job that I couldn't pass up and you know that and you loved me and you wanted to be with me, so you came with me. - I know, I was just wondering, don't you feel bad about the whole situation, even just like a little bit? You know, I had a job, I had a family. You know, I just left it. Love makes people do crazy things, I guess. Mmmm, what's this, white cheddar? - No. (muffled beat music) - [Tourist] Ocupado. Ocupado. (head thudding) (Lindsey groaning) (Joe chuckling) - Do you need a bucket? Oh, I'm sorry, I'll leave you alone. (muffled beat music) - I know you hate me. Can you just not right now? - You may be weird. I mean, you put mayo on nachos. You were the way. You made him happy. Maybe I have been too hard on you, you know what I mean? You good people. - Thank you. I think so too. - Well let's go have some cake, girl! Quit crying. Let's go, there's cake to be had, girl. - Okay. Can we pound it? - Pound it out. Let's go, oh. Come on, let's go. - [Lindsey] I have jokes. - [Tourist] Ocupado. - I don't read but thanks for coming. (Angie chuckling) (Angie screaming) (mellow saxophone music) - So I wanna tell you something, Shawn. - Oh, what? Uh, okay. - It's kind of a big deal and I don't want you to freak out. (Shawn chuckling) - When have I ever freaked out? - Okay. Here it goes. I have a man waiting at home for me and he's the love of my life. - Pardon? - He's three months old and he's my son. - Oh. Oh, son. Wait, wait, is he mine? (Lauren chuckling) - Shawn, I haven't seen you in like two years. - Have you taken all the tests? - Shawn, his father is my ex. I just wanted you to know that I'm a mommy is all. - Yeah, gotcha, gotcha. Wow. Okay, so where do you stand on having more? - Since when do you want kids? - Huh? - I vividly remember you saying, I never want kids, they're monsters. And, frankly, that's around the time I realized it wasn't gonna work and we broke up. But that was a long time ago. We're different people now. - [Shawn] Yeah. - [Lauren] Are you okay? - I don't know. - Do you want me to take you home? - No... I'm sorry. It is... It was really nice to see you. I can't do this. - [Lindsey] Shawn, what are you doing? - [Shawn] I need to talk to you. - About what? We broke up, you moved on, I'm fine. - Can we just talk, please? - Okay. - [Kennel Man] Hey! (sinister music) - What is the meaning of this? - Those two unleashed a kennel of wild strays on me! I'm lucky to be standing here before you. - This is a private party! - It's time to repay the favor! (suspenseful music) - Nobody attacks my friends and gets away with it! - Oh, you wanna piece? - Goddamn right! It's go time, motherfucker! (exciting beat music) (punches thudding) - Yeah! Yeah! (Joe groaning) (punches thudding) (Angie yelling) (punches thudding) - Don't get involved. (glass shattering) - Yeah, son! Yeah, son! (Angie yelling) (bone cracking) (balloon popping) - Get him! Get him! (suspenseful music) - Boom! Boom! - Finish him! (kid thudding) (table crunching) (dramatic music) - There's your school lunch! (crowd cheering) - I never saw the Grand Canyon. (crowd cheering) - [Joe] You beat that fool crazy. - [Angie] Hell yeah I did. - Beat him up. - Went hard. - Hard life. - [Angie] Fuck yeah. - I thought you quit. - I did. I only smoke before sex now. - Before? (wink chiming) (upbeat music) Hell yeah, girl, shit! - They make a good team. - Oh, jeez Louise. So where's your date? - Gone. Yeah, she only had her babysitter till 11. Yeah, she's a mommy. Trust me, I was just as surprised as you are. - That's good, right, because that's, that's what you've always wanted, so. - No, I wanted to have a baby. I wanted to make something with the one that I love. You know, I don't know. Maybe I'm just not suited for that life. - I thought that I needed to have a one-night-stand to, for once, use a man for something other than emotional support but, I don't know, maybe I'm just... Maybe that's just not me. - What? What is empty physical love? - I know! And what are babies? - Like, little people, I guess. - Yeah. - Hey, what're you doing tomorrow? - Oh no. - What? - Are you asking me out right now? - I don't know. I know that I would like to see you tomorrow, okay? Whatever that means. - I will check my calender. (pleasant music) - [Kennel Man] That was a weird party. (Ray chuckling) - You're witty too. - [Kennel Man] I just, I had a plan. I was gonna come in here and I was gonna fight for my honor. You know, like in "Karate Kid II." - Yeah. - [Kennel Man] But it turned out to be more like-- - "The Sandlot 2." - [Kennel Man] No, "Karate Kid III," the one with the chick. She really kicked me hard. - I don't watch movies with women in it. - [Kennel Man] Well that's probably a good practice. (truck door cranking) - This just feels right, you know? We have absolutely no idea where we stand but it doesn't even matter. - Isn't he great? - Thanks for taking me back, man. - You know you're my best friend, right? You can't get rid of me. You know what, I should be thanking you for forgiving my despicable behavior. - You meant well, I get it, I get it, I do. - And I'm a man of my word. Go ahead, say it. - Say what? - The N-word. - I don't wanna call you the N-word. - It's okay, come on. - All right, here we go. You ready? - I'm ready, let's go. - Nosferatu. (Joe sighing) - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Feel good? - Yeah, man, I haven't been called that since I was a kid. Well, my mom still calls me that but it's not that bad, you know? - Yeah. - Not that bad. - Good. (pleasant guitar music) Yeah? That's great, man. - Hell yeah! Hell yeah, man! You know, them girls been getting down with that lesbian shit? I'm gonna get all in-between that! Hell yeah! Hell yeah! - Okay, calm down.
