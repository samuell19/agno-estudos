I therefore pronounce you man and wife. Congratulations, Albert. And you too, Anna. You're a lucky couple, thanks to the baron. It isn't every master who gives his servants a beautiful wedding. Nonsense, nonsense. Albert's been in this family all his life, and his father before him. He's part of it. I don't know what Baroness would do without our little Anna here. I hope you'll be very happy, my dear. If Albert makes half good as a husband as he is a butler, you'll have no cause for complaint. A little gift from the baroness and myself. You know a good pipe is a woman's only rival. Thank you so much, thank you. And the crest. The von Burgen crest for me? Why not? I'm sure it means as much to you as to anyone in my family. It does, sir. And when I have a son, I hope-- Well... Well, all in good time, sir. - Congratulations, Albert. - And you too, Anna. Well, uh... Well, uh-- I arranged to have refreshments served for the guests, sir. And the servants, do they...? They are having a little supper downstairs. I see, I see. Trust you to arrange things, Albert. Thank you, sir. Just starting the new grapes into the press, and we wondered if the bride would tread them for us. New wine and a fruitful bride. Come: Are you Karl Schneider? Yeah. You wait in the kitchen. Wait in the kitchen? There is a mistake, Your Excellency. You're the new chauffeur. Yes. Well, that's what they told me to tell you. Hey! Pay the 5 shillings you owe me. Alright. Catch, grandpa. Which way do I go? In there. Where's everybody? Out to the wedding. Huh? There, out at the wedding. [ALL CHEERING You're just visiting, aren't you? Yes. We came just for the weekend. I'm with the countess. Oh. We're from Paris. Of course, I could see you're from Paris. It's written all over you. I feel so uncomfortable here. These provincials are so-- Oh, I know. Just a lot of servants. Give them enough wine and food, and they're satisfied. We're different. You're so right. Of course, I'm only a chauffeur, but I travel around and see the world, try to educate myself, see people. Uh, say, do you, uh, have to stay with the countess every night? Oh, yes. I always have to be in the same room with her. Never a night off? No. Now, Albert, we must kiss the bride. Alright. It's alright, I'm the new chauffeur. Anna, you were bashful. Alright, come on. Let's do this. Hello, child. Unusual wedding. Yeah. Guests and servants all mixed up. Have you known von Burgen long? No, not long. I met him through the Rothchilds. Rothchild? Are you in the banking business? No, automobile. Oh. May I have a sandwich? Oh, pardon me. How do you do? Countess. Oh, I see you know each other. Thank you. I've had that pleasure. I'll leave you with the Countess. I hope to see you again. Thank you. What are you doing here? I'm the new chauffeur. But you can't work here. But I have the most excellent of references. I have even one from madame that she wrote, I dictated. You're shameless. I thought I had given madame complete satisfaction. You can't work here, you can't. The baroness is a friend of mine. If you don't go, I'll tell her-- Here comes the baroness now. I'll tell her myself. Karl Schneider, the new chauffeur. At your service, madame. Oh, from the employment agency. And before I'm engaged, the Countess de Marnac would like you to know-- Only, my dear Eloise, that he was my chauffeur last winter. He's a very excellent chauffeur. Madame is too kind. Things are rather confused today. You better report to the servants' quarters. Countess. Are you the cook? What do I look like? Well, I-- I haven't seen Your Royal Highness before. Huh? And who are you? The new chauffeur. Oh. I'd like my dinner. Your dinner? I'd like a little caviar first, then some onion soup. And salad, of course, crab preferred. And then, a nice rare slice of roast beef. And perhaps Your Excellency would like to have it served in your room? No, I'm not fussy. I'll have it here. You chauffeurs are all alike. Good for nothing loafers! Oh, Karl. Ah. I'm sorry I didn't have a chance to talk with you. Oh, I understand. That's fine. Congratulations. Uh, thanks, thanks. Um, all fixed up, huh? Oh, yes. Got a place to sleep? Great. Well, goodnight then. And I don't have to wish you a good night. Goodnight. I must carry my bride over the threshold. Oh, Albert, it's lovely. We practically have two rooms. Oh. Oh, Anna. Now, close your eyes. Come here. Don't look. Don't look. A radio! Oh, Albert, you're so good to me. No, no, no. No, it isn't nonsense. It's true. When I first came here, I was nothing but a scared little kitchen maid. All I could say was, "Yes, sir" and "No, sir." Remember? And then you taught me how to be a parlor maid. And then lady's maid to the baroness. And now, you've married me. Oh, Albert, I'm so grateful. You forget about being grateful. Just be happy, that's all. Always happy. No, not that one. Play your jack. Francoise, you're drunk! Hick. So am I. Oh, Albert. All the other maids are jealous of me. You're distinguished-looking with your handsome sideburns. Well, you better mind your P's and Q's, young lady or you'll lose your handsome husband. Ooh, you don't frighten me a bit. You're just a gruff old bear. But a sweet one. Please say you'll always love me. Always, darling. So. No, no, come on, stop it. Anna, you're tickling me. Albert, not tonight. Oh, buzz, buzz, buzz. They can't look at a bell button without pushing it. Isn't Francoise looking after things tonight? Yes, dear, but something must have happened. Oh, alright, alright. But don't worry, darling. My father was a butler and he had nine children between buzzers. But I don't wanna go to bed. Get downstairs, blockhead! Oh, I don't want... That will be all, Francoise, for tonight. I'm sorry, sir. I will stay and serve the guests. Cognac or cr√®me de menthe? Oh, cognac. Good man, Albert. My mother used to keep her wedding wreath in a glass case like that too. Forgive me for watching you. It kind of made me homesick. Does she live far away? I lost her when I was a little boy. Oh, how sad. She used to do that too. Always keeping the glass bright and shiny. Once when I was a little boy, I was playing and knocked it over and broke it. I cried, and my mother cried. Then I started saving my pennies to buy her a new one. But I was so little and it took so long that when I saved up enough it was too late. You mean she...? I bought her a funeral wreath instead. Oh, you poor child. I didn't mean to tell my troubles to a stranger, especially tonight when you should be so happy. Oh, you mustn't feel that we're strangers. You're gonna right at home here. I've been happier here than I've ever been in my whole life. Here, let me fix it. There. One little kiss and I'll say good night. That's the name of the piece they're playing. Oh. Goodnight, Baron. That's Albert. You'd better go now. Alright. Anna. Yes, sir. Now, Anna, I'm going to be very angry with you and give you a good scolding. How many times have I told you not to call me sir? Oh, Albert. For a moment I really thought you were angry at me. Oh, darling. I wouldn't frighten you for the whole world. Hold me tight, Albert. Don't ever let anything happen to you, me and our home. Ah, rats at the cheese. Just a small mouse, Sophie. Say. Be careful, Sophie. You might fall and break your what-you-may-call-it. You've got flour on your what-you-may-call-it. Get it off, will you? Thank you. I beg pardon, would madame mind taking the wheel for a moment? My ring caught in your hair. Oh, yes. There. Sorry, madame. Oh, it's a lady's ring. It was a lady's ring. How long were you with the countess? Nearly two years, madame. The countess said you are very discreet, Karl. Madame can trust me to remember everything and to forget everything. Drive me to number 18 Louise Strasse. Yes, madame. Oh, I thank you very much. The key to your pocketbook, lady. Thanks. My coat, madame. Oh, no, no. You'll be cold. I am always warm, madame. Oh! My feet are wet. Lift them, madame. Thank you, Karl. Send Anna up to me right away, please. Yes, madame. The car broke down. Yes, madame. Say, what kind of an accident did you have? Whatever kind his nibs will believe. His nibs? The boss, the baron. Now, you can't be disrespectful and remain here, Karl. I haven't been disrespectful to you, have I? The very foundation of our policy is respect of upstairs. Now, look, if I respect you and your wife because you behave-- Now, Karl, let me make myself clear to you. Clear. I've known this kind of a thing since I was 7 years old. We didn't have any accident. We pulled up in a little street, Baroness got-- The baroness said you had an accident. Well, you want me to respect her for that? If we criticize, I mean, downstairs, we are no longer servants. We have broken our code. You know, as servants, we don't produce a living. It's done for us. As long as we are able, we serve them as well as we can. But if we are old or sick, we are taken care of. And if they go wrong, we just close our eyes to it, huh? You don't have to listen unless you want to stay here. When they go wrong, what right do we have to say whether they're right or wrong? If a servant is out of order, yes, I understand that. Life downstairs is very simple. But up there, the rules are different. And I have no contact but service. And no feeling but deep loyalty and affection. I get you. Friend, Albert, I wish to report that the Baroness had trouble with her carburetor. It delayed her a little bit. Well, that's right. Say, I hope you'll accommodate yourself to us. You know I like you, and my wife likes you too. I like your wife. I like you too. You know, Albert, I wish we could get together and have a good serious conversation. Alright. Because I'll respect the baroness if you want me to. I'll even respect the baron's bum kidney if it'll make you happy. "Schnitzelbank." You're just what we've needed here, Karl. Someone to drink and laugh with. To tell you the truth, it's a little dull here sometimes. Oh, Albert. Now, darling, I just mean it isn't the way it used to be, in the old days. Why, you wouldn't think it to look at him now but the Baron was a wild one when he was younger. No. He was in the Life Guards then. And every weekend, he'd fill the house with officers, and all of them brought their girls. Sure. Well, it got so bad the emperor finally stopped it. But while it lasted, it was a gay, wild time. Plenty of tips, I'll bet, huh? Tips. Well, once an archduke was up here. He got himself so drunk, he started out to meet the emperor with his uniform on from the waist up and nothing but his sword and his underdrawers below. I had to chase all the way to town with his pants. And he gave me a hundred kronen for it. No? Yes, sir. You young fellows don't know what it was like before the war. Oh, Karl, too many cigarettes. You should try a good smoke like this. You know, I worked for an American once in Paris. Now, here you are. Americans. What's a lot of money if you don't know how to have a good time? Why, I remember the baron had here once the whole imperial ballet. All 30 of them. Hmm. Well, sir, well, I'll tell you about that some other time. Oh. Albert, I think that's mean. Now, now, Anna, you're just married. New wives, they want to have everything at once. Everything. Ah, their nibs are at it again. Yes. No, Karl, you just stay here. Have more coffee with Anna. I'll be back. Don't forget, we've still got to have that serious talk. Oh, you bet. Sure. Hurry back, Albert. You know, sometimes I wish I had a place like this of my own. Maybe you will someday. No, not me. Something in my blood that just makes me move on and move on. Some wild crazy strain. I know. I used to dream about all the places I'd like to see. Paris, London, America. Haven't you ever been away from here? Not very far. Ah. Oh, what fun it would be showing you some of the places I've seen. You'd love Paris. Maybe someday the baroness will take me to Paris with her. And Monte Carlo. Oh. There's a place up on the hill where you can have dinner on moonlight nights, see all the way to Corsica. Gee, it's beautiful. I don't see why you wanna settle down. If I were a man, I'd just wanna keep on traveling and traveling. Well, it has its good points. Sometimes I find I have to leave a place when I don't want to. Something happens and my bags are packed and I'm on my way. Alone. Oh, it's getting cold, isn't it? Well, let's go inside. It's been great being here, talking to you tonight. It makes me realize what I've missed. Albert always asks new servants to come here and have coffee with him. Well, I'm grateful anyway. You're so friendly and interested. I feel toward you as if you were my sister. You don't mind me feeling that way, do you? No. Aw, thanks. Thanks. You do that again and I'll-- You'll do what? I'll tell my husband. I'll tell him myself. Hello, Albert. I wanted to tell you-- He just wanted to tell you if there weren't any more orders, he wanted to go to bed early. Go to bed? Oh, nonsense. What do you think I brought this beer for? Albert. If you don't mind I'll just take this and finish it in my own room. Thanks. Oh. Goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight. Ah, what's the matter? Just that... Well, I don't want him here. Why? Karl is a fine fellow. I know but-- Oh no, darling. You are just tired, that's all. Now go to bed while I finish my beer. Well, you have a nerve. Coming and sitting in my room without so much as an if you please or by your leave or... You smell of onions. Phew. But last night-- Well, what about last night? Uh, I thought that-- You thought-- Listen. What do you think I am, a train that runs on schedule? Last night was last night. Well? I only wanted to bring you some dessert. Dessert. Food, food, food. You ever think of anything else? You're like a walking icebox. Don't insult me please by treating me like a prize hog you're fattening for market. Ah, Sophie. There are finer things in life than merely eating or drinking. Finer things than the pleasures of the moment or the hour. Sophie, do you know what I said to myself the first time I saw you? I said, there is a woman with a soul. But, Sophie, you disappoint me. Aw, there, there, Sophie. Now, now. I spoke too sharply. But that's because I'm very high strung. It's the mixed blood in my veins. Why, Sophie, if I were to tell you of my ancestry. My father was... Then you wouldn't believe me if I told you. Oh, yes, I would. Anyone would know that you were a gentleman. A gentleman? My dear Sophie, my father was a Spanish grandee. And my mother, how she suffered. Trying to hide her proud but guilty secret. Having none of the sacred memories of marriage that other women have. No wedding ring, no wedding wreath. Only a son who couldn't bear his father's name. Sophie, you oughtn't keep your money in your stocking. But it's safe there. Now, I know, but it spoils the shape of your leg. Aw, gee, please take it, Anna. I bought it just for you that day I drove the Baroness to town. No, Karl. I don't want it. In spite of how hard I try to please you, everything I do is wrong. Haven't I apologized for kissing you that night? Haven't I behaved myself ever since? Nearly ever since. Aw, isn't everyone pleased with me? Even Albert. Is there anyone I haven't been nice to? Yes, Sophie. You've made her think you cared. Sophie? But-- I do care about her. Why, I feel toward Sophie as if she were my mother. Your mother. Why, how else could I feel? Why, Anna, you don't think... Do you? No. Well. Aw, poor Sophie. Here she's worked so hard for all these years, slaving and sweating over a hot stove. Now she's old and unattractive, what's she got? A lot of money. And what's that? Karl, I'm sorry I spoke about it. Well. We all make mistakes. Look, it goes on this way, Anna. Anna, the baroness wants to see you right away. We are going on a fishing trip tomorrow. Alright, Albert. And you, Karl, you go and get the baron's fishing rods from the storeroom and take them upstairs. Right. What shall I do with these, madame? Those? You can have them if you like it. Those water stains never came out. Oh, thank you, madame. Where did you get that clip? Why-- It's mine. Of course, it's mine. I just bought it. What are you doing with it? Well, why don't you answer? Did you steal it? No, madame. It couldn't be yours. Oh, don't be absurd. Of course it's mine. Don't I know my own jewelry? To think that a girl like you, brought up in our own household, could be a common thief. Pardon me, madame. I couldn't help hearing. Couldn't help hearing what? Your calling Anna a thief. What should I call her? A duchess? Oh, no, madame. But the clip Anna was wearing is not yours. I gave it to her. A wedding present. You gave it to her? I picked it up in a little place on the Louise Strasse. Louise Strasse? Madame has probably never heard of the street. It hasn't a very good name. I can even give madame the address if she cares for it. Number-- I am not interested. As madame wishes. But I can assure you, madame, the clip is not yours. I was mistaken. It's not mine. I'm sorry, Anna. Oh, please, madame-- You may go now. I don't know how to thank you. Taking my part right in front of the baroness' face. Aw, it's nothing. I wouldn't see anyone falsely accused, even if it would cost me my job. Well, I think you're just wonderful. Nothing at all. I'd do it for anyone. Well, my dear, this time tomorrow night, we shall be on the boat. Headed for deep water and big fish. Oh, I hate the idea of smelling fish over the weekend. Tut, tut, my dear. A lot of worse things you can smell over the weekend than fish. Hic. That reminds me, I mustn't forget the new pills for my liver. My dyspeptic tablets and some medicine in case I get seasick. Hick. Nicky, are you ever going to stop imagining there is something wrong with you? You are perfectly healthy. Ah, that always tops hiccups. Hick. We'd better call off this fishing trip. But why? Because you're expecting to get sick. Who said I was sick? I never felt better in my life. I'm only thinking of your happiness. I'm a very lucky man, especially in this day of intriguing scandal to have a wife like you. Scandal? Yesterday, I heard that old Von Reppet's wife has a lover. What do you expect? He's 80, she's 23. And he has asthma. Well, they do a lot of things for asthma these days. I'm very much afraid, Nicky. We have a little scandal in our own house. Scandal? Here, in this house? Impossible. Hick. Nevertheless, it greatly concerns Albert. Albert? But he just got married. Surely he's not dissatisfied already. Not Albert but his wife. And Karl, the new chauffeur. He gave her a piece of jewelry. Karl? Yes. You mean to tell me that Karl and Anna are...? Mm-hm. Karl? He's a hefty young fellow. And Anna's a very pretty girl. Sweetheart, you look just like you did the night we were married. Nicky, remember what the doctor said. You're right. I must be careful. Goodnight. Goodnight. Oh, Albert. Yes, madame. Albert, as the baron won't need you on this fishing trip, it might be a good idea for you to... Well, to put the house in order. Yes, madame. Some of the servants are new. Let me see. Hans, Leisel... And Karl. You might want to make some changes. Use your own judgment. Thank you, madame. Anything else, madame? That's all. Goodnight, Albert. What's the matter with everything? Half my equipment isn't here. No, no, no. I knew it wasn't here. Albert! Where've you been? I was calling you. I'm sorry, sir. Didn't I tell you to be sure and bring my trolling rod? It's in your state room, sir. Well, why didn't somebody tell me? Well, what are we waiting for? Can't stay here all day. Alright, sir. I've put out your things, sir. My woolen socks? Yes, and your flannel drawers. Good man, Albert. I'll be going ashore then, sir. What? What? Going ashore? What for? But I understood you wouldn't need me, sir. The baroness said-- Nonsense. Of course, you're coming. Eloise, what's all this about Albert not coming? I didn't think you'd need him. There's so much to be done at home. Not need him? Do you realize that we'll be practically roughing it for three days? How do you think I can rough it without Albert? What's the matter? Karl and Anna. What? What? Oh, nothing. Very well, then. Alright, captain, clear away. Goodbye, Albert. Karl. There is something I want to say to you. What's the matter, Albert? You know what's the matter. And it's got to stop, you understand? Stop? What's got to stop? Oh, I am a patient man, Karl. But I've had enough of your impudence. Do you hear me? You are to keep out of my home. You are not to speak to my wife. Not speak to Anna? What will she say? Never mind that. You leave her alone altogether. What's going on here? Why don't you go ashore, Karl? Albert wishes to speak to me, sir. Last minute instructions. Fine time for that. Come, come. Get ashore. Yes, sir. Alright, captain. Clear away. So long, Albert! Are you sure Albert said it was alright? To stop for dinner? Sure. Don't you remember he called me back just as I was leaving the boat? That's what we were talking about. I wonder why he stayed. He said he wasn't going with them. Well, he didn't expect to. That's why he wanted to be sure you were gonna have a good time tonight. Albert's so thoughtful. Say, you don't have to tell me what a great fellow Albert is. Not after the way he's treated me. Well, here's to good old Albert. Ooh, I feel so good. So warm inside. Wonder what makes me feel so warm inside. Couldn't be the wine, could it? No. If I thought it was the wine, I wouldn't drink any more. Certainly wouldn't. Oh, you've got his feet all wet. Poor Albert. Albert? Sure, see his handsome sideburns? Hey, come on, now. They do tickle, don't they? What tickles? Albert's sideburns. Aw, poor Albert. Albert's leaving you. Eh, an old affair. - A family too, huh? - Your husband's left you. What's the matter with me? Acting like this. I don't know what I'm laughing at. Excuse me. Anna. Look, I know where you like to be kissed. What do you mean? It's all marked out by a cute little mole. Looks like a drop of chocolate. Didn't Albert ever tell you how cute it was? Albert never looks at the back of my neck. Not even to see if it was clean? Karl, I'm on fire. Ah, don't worry a fellow. I'll have it out in a second. Oh. Look. Alright now, see? Now it's alright. The fire's all out. I know, but-- Your room's ready any time you want it. What are you talking about? I didn't order any room. Oh, yes, sir. Everything as you said. The wine and a fire, and a nice surprise for the lady. Anna, please. But it was for you, sir. Don't you remember the money? Oh, money, huh? That's what you wanted. But, sir, you-- What's wrong, sir? The man here made a mistake. Only, unfortunately, it concerns this lady for whom I have only the deepest respect. Here. Next time you want money, try and get it honestly. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. A lot of sympathy I get from you. I might have died right beside you for all you care. Does it hurt so much, Nicky? It's beginning to throb. That's bad. After all the plans I made for this trip, to think this should've happened. Well, what do you expect on a fishing trip? It's a wonder you haven't run a fish hook into you before. Albert, are you sure that was a new fish hook? Yes, sir, they were all new. Anna, please. Why won't you believe me? It was a mistake. I don't believe anything about you. I never was so ashamed in my life. Letting them think I was that kind of girl. Just you wait till Albert-- I don't believe Albert said you could take me out. He didn't You know he didn't. Anna, please. You lied about that too. Be quiet. You'll have the whole house up. Then what'll they think? You lied to me about Albert. You told me he said I could go, didn't you? Now what will I do? What'll I do if he finds out? He needn't find out. You don't have to tell him. So you did do it. And now you want me to lie to him. I've never lied to Albert in my whole life, and now you're trying to make me do it. Listen, Anna, I've got to tell you the truth. I've done everything you said. Everything. I've deceived you and I've lied to you. Because I'm so crazy about you. I'd have done anything as long as I could be with you. Now, I'll go on. Nothing you can say will be bad enough. So you won't even talk to me. Well, I deserve that too. Listen, Anna. I never had much of a chance. I've never had anyone tell me the right thing to do. I've had to fight my way through life alone. Bad men and bad women. I've never been in love with anyone good, like you, before. I didn't know how to treat you. Well, it's too late now. Goodbye, Anna. Goodbye? I'm going away. I-- I can't stay here now after what I've done. You've made me so ashamed. I couldn't look you in the face again. But-- But your job. I wouldn't wanna put you out of that. Oh, that's alright. I'll find another one. And if I don't, well, there's no one to care. Don't you worry about me. I'm not worth it. Anna, before I go, would you--? Could you kiss me goodbye? Come on, come on. Open the door. Well, why doesn't somebody do something? I'll telephone Dr. Stern. Have someone get my bed ready. Albert. Yes, sir? You sure that fish hook was new? Quite new, sir. Hello, Albert. How did you get back? We hired a car. What are you doing here? I'm just going to wash the car. Good morning, Anna. You're-- You're back early, Albert. Yes. Karl said good morning to you, Anna. Oh, good morning, Karl. Good morning. What time did you get back last night? Oh, I don't know. It wasn't very late. What time was it, Anna? About-- About 9:00, I think. Yes. Look at that button. What do you mean appearing that way? Sorry. I didn't see it. I'll have it fixed. I won't tolerate such slovenly habits in this house. I've had enough of it. You can draw your wages. Draw my-- You mean I'm sacked? Yes. Just on account of a loose button? I am not going to discuss it. Has the baroness complained about me? Now, that has nothing to do with it. I am responsible for the servants in this house. Do you understand? Yes, I understand, Albert. How was the music last night? Music? What do you mean? There was a concert from Vienna. Gypsy music, over the radio. Oh, I didn't turn it on. I thought you would have. There wasn't much else for you to do. Anna, is that all you have to tell me? Yes, Albert. I'd better go to the baroness. No. You're not going to the baroness looking the way you are. You haven't got your cap and apron on. What do you think the baroness will say to that? I'm sorry, I-- You go and make yourself presentable at once. You know what I expect on a servant in this house. Servant? You heard what I said. Oh. Albert, I wasn't truthful out there just now. And where had you been? Where did you come from? From the caf√©. He told me you asked him to take me there. We drank a lot of wine, we stayed very late. Yeah. You drank a lot of wine and you allowed him to make love to you. I'm sorry, Albert. More than I can tell you. Now quit lying about it. Get yourself dressed. You have work to do. Now you just wait a minute. I don't deserve to have you and me go all to smash. I've found out for the first time in my life, for the first time, that there are more than two kinds of feelings in the world. Is that my fault? There's a kind of way of making love that drives you mad and crazy, so that you don't know what you're doing. You gonna throw me out on the streets because I never knew this? Now, you stop this kind of talk and stop it right now. You learn something vile from a rat and you forget that you're my wife, that I love you, and you bring him in here. Alright. You good, good man. I'll stop this kind of talk. You believe exactly what you wanna believe, but you listen. Whatever's happened, some of it's your fault. Some of it. You think you can make love in the same frozen way you do everything else. You think that's all I should ever have to wish for. Well, I tell you plain and straight right now. It's nothing of the kind. I meant no harm. I don't want anything but you and my home. But if you're gonna be so good and so perfect and so unforgiving that I can't have that, then I thank heaven I've found there is something else. Something that makes you dizzy, you don't know what's happened and you don't care. Now you go ahead and believe anything you like. Do you realize that this is blackmail? That's just the word I was trying to remember. But not really, madame. Merely a desire to remain longer in the employ of so charming a lady. I'm sorry I've to put the matter before you this way, but that's what happens to servants. Sometimes, our duties are not pleasant. You are sure you won't take money? Well, not for the present. All I want is to remain in your services here until I make my plans. Madame will instruct Albert? Sophie! I heard you, I heard you. It seems I can't go away for one night without things going to pieces. What are you telling that to me for? Anyone complained about not getting enough to eat? I want it understood I expect discipline in this house. Discipline, eh? You talk so much about order in this house. Why don't you look after your own home? What do you mean? Hmm, you ask that precious Anna of yours what I mean. Ask her what's been going on between her and Karl. Of course I may be mistaken. Maybe it wasn't Anna that I saw coming home this morning with Karl at 5:00. Now, that's enough! Well, of course, if you're not interested. I'm not interested in anything you've got to tell me about my wife. Anna is a good girl and she's a good wife. And Karl is through. I've dismissed him. He's leaving this house. Leaving? Karl's leaving? Yes, I fired him. Just as I'll fire anyone that's insolent. Do you hear me? Albert. Yes, madame. Karl tells me that you have dismissed him. Yes, madame. I, uh... I've found Karl quite satisfactory. But, madame-- I wish him to remain. But, uh... After all, Karl is my chauffeur. It is not your place to discharge him. But, madame, always with the servants-- I was responsible-- I don't wish to discuss it. So you fired him, eh? Any orders, Albert? No. Well, if you think of any, let me know, will you? You get back to your work, you. There's plenty to do without you standing around loafing. Queen Sophie. One word from you and they all jump, huh? What were you doing sneaking home with Anna at daylight? Ah, so you jump too. Do you think anyone else saw? Say, listen, Sophie, what a time I had. On the way from the boat, nothing would do but she had to stop in some place and get something to eat and drink. We argued because I didn't think Albert would like it. Well, finally I gave in. You talk about these nice quiet girls, huh? When they get a few drinks in them, well-- The only thing that saved me was the place closing. Was I glad to get her home safe. Phew. You tell it very good. Almost as good as you tell the story about the coffee shop you're going to buy for me in Vienna with my money. That's what you want, my money! "You shouldn't work so hard, Sophie. What you should have is a nice little business of your own with a man like me to help you run it." My savings. All I've got to show for 35 years of hard work. Ever since I was 9 years old. And you, all the time carrying on with that moon-faced hussy and laughing at me. Both of you laughing at me! I might have known that you didn't love me. Alright, I don't love you. Do you like that? Oh, Karl. "Oh, Karl." Listen. Nag, nag, nag. If there's anything I hate, it's women nagging at me. You ought to be pretty grateful to me. I've given you a lot of time and a lot of attention. And what's it cost you? Nothing. Cost me? Yes, cost you. With a face like that, you ought to pay plenty. Goodbye, grandma. No, madame, I couldn't. I couldn't do it. There's no place in this household for Karl and me. Albert, please. This house needs you now more than ever before. I need you. I can't discharge him. He forced me to keep him on. Forced you? I don't understand. Karl is blackmailing me. Oh, madame. You should have told me. Oh, that liar. That blackmailer! What kind of story is he making up about you? It isn't a story he's making up. It's something he knows. About you, madame? Oh, it's ridiculous. Well, the police will deal with him. The police? Oh, no, no, Albert. We can't do that. Don't you see? What he knows about me is true. I don't dare to let him go. We'll have to find another way to deal with this... This Karl. I am sorry, madame. I was wrong to think of my pride. There are other things to be protected. You must be careful. Men like that is dangerous. I told you, madame. I've always been responsible for the servants in this house. I am still responsible. And now if you'll excuse me. Albert. About Anna. She is young. No match for a man like Karl. You must be patient with her. Women sometimes do foolish things just for lack of understanding. Yes. I can see that now. Come in. Well, what do you want? I'm so unhappy. You haven't spoken to me. You haven't even looked at me. Not since-- Not since you insulted me. Oh, Karl. I didn't mean it. I can't stand it if you don't speak to me. I don't care what you do! Hah, that's good. You don't care what I do. What have I done? I-- I meant you and Anna. So you're up here to start all that over again, huh? More suspicions, more insults, more reproaches. Please, Karl. Don't let us quarrel. I can't get along without you. I'll do anything if you'll only let me be near you. For a few days I was so happy. Karl, can't we do what we said? Buy the coffee shop? With your money. That's what you said before, threw it in my teeth. Think I'm gonna give you another chance to do that? I'm not a sentimental fool all the time. It's our money, Karl. Here, look. Here it is, all of it. You know the saddest part of it? Just the day before, I went all over Vienna looking for the right kind of a coffee shop to buy. Tramping around in the sun-- Didn't you have a car? Do you think I'd use the baron's car to transact my own personal business? And did I find a beauty. Ah. Black marble tabletops, red plush furniture, gilt mirrors Why, it was the most beautiful coffee shop in Vienna. We could have made a fortune out of it. Here, Karl. Sophie, you hurt me. Thinking of money at a time like this. Oh. Hurry up with those squabs! Those lobsters are ready. Better send them upstairs. Hey, how about that oven? And, Anna, tell Otto to get out three bottles of Napoleon brandy. It isn't high enough. It's 4 inches high. It is not high enough. What are you talking? It is! It isn't high enough for this house. I working 20 years in this house. Hey, will you two frogs shut up? Forty-four, 46, 48, 50-- Shut up! Didn't the man tell you to shut up? Look. Sixty, sixty-five hundred. What time does the fast train leave from Vienna for Paris? Otto. Three bottles of Napoleon brandy upstairs. What? Three bottles, Napoleon brandy upstairs. Anna. Anna. I've been looking all over for you. Karl, let me go. I'm frightened. Oh, it's alright to be frightened, only don't let it sink you. Look, sweetheart, I haven't forgotten you. I was just waiting till my plans were ready. There's a train leaving for Vienna in an hour. Think of it. Karl. Karl, please. I love Albert. It's late for you to be thinking about that. Now, let's cut out this bunk! You're as crazy about me as I am about you, and you know it! We're going off someplace where you'll have a chance to talk to me about it. You love me. You love me. No, no, Karl. All I wanna do is to be with my husband and my work. Let me go, please! Now, listen. You going with me the way I want you to or stay here till they kick you out? Oh, Karl, please have a little pity. Pity? Ah, say, I love you. Oh, listen, Anna. I've got plenty of money to spend. We'll spend it like kings. I'm gonna make you happy. That's Sophie's money! Ah, what do you care? I'm gonna spend it on you. Spend Sophie's money on me? Yes. No, I won't go with you! I won't! Ah, say, listen. There's not a chance in the world of me leaving you here. Not a chance. How do you know Albert will want you to stay once he learns the truth about us. He will learn it because I'll tell him. Oh, no. Oh, yes. And every man, woman and child around the place. And if Albert is slob enough to wanna forgive you, the rest of them will make life so tough for you, you won't be able to live here. You rotten beast! Let me go! So you won't go, huh? Alright, then, I'll tell Albert. I'll tell Albert and he'll kick you out! Come here. Give me that! Give me that money! Give me that. I'll see what it is, sir. Albert, I'm sorry. A barrel slipped and knocked over a wine rack. I tried to catch it-- Albert! Albert. Albert. Albert! No. Albert! I'm sorry, sir, but many bottles of your best wine have been broken. I lost my head. The spilling of the wine isn't important enough for this! Yes, sir, I'm-- I'm sorry. Get to work and clear up the mess. And let me hear no more of it! Yes, sir. You people get back to work! And help clean up the cellar! Let's clean this place up. "Liebfrauenmilch." Well, Karl, I think I was a bit hasty. Anna, you go upstairs and change your clothes. And, Franz, you and Ernst can get back to the kitchen. We'll finish this tomorrow. No, Karl, don't you go. You're still nervous. I'm sorry I lost my temper. That isn't the way to handle things. Better have something to drink, huh? Sure. Here's one that's not broken. Not broken, Karl, but disturbed. Wine is like that, easily upset. Like a woman. When it's upset, it takes time to settle down again. Time for the dregs to get down to the bottom again. But with a little care, time and rest, it will be good again. But you must take care of the wine. And women. Otto here, will take care of the wine. And the women, well, that's a man's job. To look after them. Some glasses, Otto. I'm sorry it happened, Albert. Oh, I guess it's too late to cry over spilled wine. It's done now. We'll have a drink, huh? Oh, no, let's have something special. I'll get a bottle. Say, I don't want any wine. Blind? No, I'm not blind. Just deaf. Can't hear. Here we are. Well, Karl. Here's to your future. And no more spilled wine. Well, Albert, I've accepted your apology. I think I'll be running along now. Yes, Karl. Ten minutes to get your things together and get out of here! Take your hands off me! Now, let's have this done quietly. I would've killed you if the baron hadn't stopped us. Oh, so you just saved my life so you could fire me, huh? Quit kidding yourself, Albert. If you want to get out of here in 10 minutes, you'll have to work fast. Say, look here, I'm gonna stay here just as long as I want to. And you're gonna like it. Get out of my sight while I can keep my hands off you! You're gonna keep your hands off me because people upstairs will tell you to. And you fire me again and I'll make a joke out of you again. The people upstairs are gonna do just I'll tell them to. No, Karl. You'll never get near the people upstairs. You're through. You'll leave the baroness out of it! And Sophie, you leave her alone! I've had all I want out of Sophie. And my wife! You're gonna save them all, aren't you? Well, now look here. When that's gone, I'll tap the baroness, and she'll pay until I'm up to my neck in it. You filthy skunk, you! So we have no chance with you. My wife has no protection against you. Come on now! Get up on your feet and fight, you yellow rat! I give you this chance! But only one of us is going up those steps. Oh, no you yellow dog, you! Albert! Albert, stop! You're killing him! Call the Baron! He's killing him! Albert! Albert! You rat, you! Albert! Come on, get up now! Come on now! - Hurry! Hurry, please. - He's killing him! Albert! Albert! Stop! Stop it! I'll attend to this! I beg your pardon, sir. But this time, I'll attend to it. He has something to tell you, some rotten thing on his mind. Come on now! Say it! Nothing, sir. Sophie, come out here. Give this girl the money that you stole. Come on! And my wife! There is something about her. Come on tell it to her! Say it! Come on! Nothing. Nothing. You snake, you! Get out of here, you! And he spoiled my meringue. Good man, Albert. Thank you, sir. Just a little housecleaning. Now, go back to your work, all of you! Just as it was before. Hurry up! Good man, Albert. Thank you, sir. What did he tell you, Albert? Nothing, darling. Everything's alright now. Don't worry. Yes, sir. Didn't I tell you not to call me sir? Yes, sir. There's just one more, madame. Oh, no, Henri. I'll interview no more chauffeurs today. Tomorrow afternoon at 3. Well? Madame's new chauffeur. I hope.
