Next, on "Great Performances"... Rodgers and Hammerstein's classic musical "The King and I" from Lincoln Center Theater's Tony Awardwinning Broadway revival. Getting to know you Kelli O'Hara stars as Mrs. Anna, the British schoolteacher charged with educating the royal household of Siam, headed by Ken Watanabe as its imperious but conflicted king. Love being loved Secret romance, class conflict, and history collide in the splendor of imperial Thailand. Kelli O'Hara and Ken Watanabe in Rodgers and Hammerstein's "The King and I." Hello, laddie. How near are we to Bangkok, Captain? You see that cluster of lights jutting out into the river? Oh, that's it. That's Bangkok. Oh, look, all our boxes. Aye, and a fair lot they are. We packed everything we had in our Singapore house, furniture and everything. Louis, where are you? Mother, Mother, look! There's Bangkok! Do you see, Mother, that cluster of light that sticks out into the river? That's it! That's Bangkok! I see, Louis. I see them. It's exciting, isn't it? Will the king of Siam come down to the dock to meet us? The king himself? I don't think so. Kings don't as a rule. I wonder if you know what you're facing, ma'am, an Englishwoman alone here in the East. Captain Orton, I've lived in the East since I was 15 years old India, Singapore. Both under the protection of the British flag, ma'am. Quite a different thing. Look, Mother! Look at that boat! Look at the dragon's head in the bow and all the men standing up carrying torches! That's the royal barge. Do you suppose that's the king, the man sitting under the gold canopy? No, that's the Kralahome, a sort of prime minister, the king's righthand man, you might say. Do you suppose he's coming out to meet us? Oh, no doubt of it. He'll be coming 'round our stern. Ma'am, if I might be allowed to offer you a word of warning. Oh, what is it, Captain? That man has power. He can use it for you or against you. Oh. I think you should know. Look, Mother. They're close. Mother, the prime minister is naked. Oh, hush, Louis. That's not a nice word. He's not naked. He's Well, he's half naked. They all look rather horrible, don't they, Mother? Father would not have liked us to be afraid, would he? No, Louis, Father would not have liked us to be afraid. Mother, does anything ever frighten you? Sometimes. What do you do? I whistle. Oh, that's why you whistle. Yes, that's why I whistle. Whenever I feel afraid, I hold my head erect And whistle a happy tune So no one will suspect I'm afraid While shivering in my shoes, I strike a careless pose And whistle a happy tune And no one ever knows I'm afraid The result of this deception is very strange to tell For when I fool the people, I fear I fool myself, as well I whistle a happy tune, and every single time The happiness in the tune Convinces me that I'm not afraid Makebelieve you're brave, and the trick will take you far You may be as brave As you makebelieve you are You may be as brave As you makebelieve you are Let's go. Aye, clear that away. While shivering in my shoes, I strike a careless pose And whistle a happy tune And no one ever knows I'm afraid The result of this deception is very strange to tell For when I fool the people, I fear I fool myself as well I whistle a happy tune, and every single time The happiness in the tune Convinces me that I'm not afraid Makebelieve you're brave, and the trick will take you far You may be as brave as you makebelieve you are You may be as brave As you makebelieve you are Ma'am, I wouldn't whistle. He might think it disrespectful. Oh, was I whistling? I'm sorry. I didn't realize. Good evening, sir! Welcome to Siam. He called you "sir"! Hush, dear. Hush. Sir, His Excellency wishes to know, are you lady who will be schoolmistress of royal children? Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Uh, yes. Have you friends in Bangkok? I know no one in Bangkok at all. Are you married, sir? I am a widow. What manner of man your deceased husband? My husband was an officer of Her Majesty's army in Uh, tell your master his business with me is in my capacity of schoolteacher to the royal children. He has no right to pry into my personal affairs. Ma'am Well, he hasn't, Captain Orton. I don't like that man. In foreign country, is best you like everyone until you leave. Your Excellency, I had no idea you spoke English. It is not necessary for you to know everything at once. You come with me now. Your boxes are carried into palace later. No, not to the palace. I'm not living at the palace. Who say? The king say, uh, ssays. The king has promised me 20 pounds a month and a house of my own. King do not always remember what he promise. If I tell him he breaks his promise, I will make anger in him. I think it is better I make anger in him about larger matters. But all I want is 10 minutes audience with him. King very busy now. New Year's celebration just finishing. Fireworks every night. Cremation of late queen just starting. Oh, oh, you've lost your queen. I'm so sorry. When did she die? Four years ago. With cremation ceremony comes also fireworks. And what am I to do in the meantime? In the meantime, you wait in palace! Your Excellency, I shall teach in the palace, but I must have a house of my own where I can go at the end of the day when my duties are over. What you wish to do in evening that cannot be done in palace? How dare you? Your Excellency, I-I'm sorry you don't understand. I came here to work. I must support myself and my young son, and I shall take nothing less than what I have been promised. You will tell king this. I will tell king this. It will be very interesting meeting. You come now. You come now, or you can stay on boat. I do not care. If you wish to stay on my ship and return to Singapore, ma'am No, thank you, Captain Orton. Your Excellency, I will go with you. I have made a bargain, and I shall live up to my part of it, but I expect a bargain to be kept on both sides. I shall go with you... To the palace. ...for the time being. Byebye, Captain Orton. Thank you very much for everything. Louis? Bye, Captain! Goodbye, laddie. Your Majesty... Well, well, well. ...I have been meaning to speak to you about English schoolteacher. She's waiting to see you. She is in Siam? How long? Two weeks. Three weeks. She has needed disciplining, Your Majesty. She object to living in palace, talks about house. She say you promise her. I do not recollect such promise. Tell her I will see her. I see her in a moment. Cambodia. The Cambodian king breaks promise. He's a liar, a liar to me and traitor to his people. Henceforth, Cambodia shall be under the protection of the French government. Protection? And who shall be next? What other countries will the French want to protect? The camel's nose is in the tent. The businessmen of Europe have a big appetite. Soon they will come to bargain with me. What do I tell them? What do I do? A country to fight for, nothing to fight with. Who, who, who? Your Majesty, this is Lun Tha, emissary from court of Burma. Ah. You are here for copying of famous Bangkok Temple. I have give permission. He brings you present from the king of Burma. Am I to trust the king of Burma? Am I to trust this present they send me, or is she a spy? I am not a spy. My name is Tuptim. You are pleased that I speak English? My name is Tuptim. The king is pleased with you. He likes you. The king is pleased. He is pleased with me My lord and master Declares he's pleased with me What does he mean? What does he know of me This lord and master? When he has looked at me What has he seen? Something young, soft and slim Painted cheek, tapering limb Smiling lips all for him Eyes that shine just for him So he thinks Just for him Though the man may be My lord and master Though he may study me As hard as he can The smile beneath my smile He'll never see He'll never know I love Another man He'll never know I love another Man Your Majesty wishes me to leave? I will tell you when I wish you to leave. Your Majesty, this is schoolteacher Madam Leonowens. You are schoolteacher? Yes, Your Majesty, I am schoolteacher. When can I start my work? You can start when I tell you to start! Yes, Your Majesty, if I start at all. What? What? What? There is one matter we have to settle, Your Majesty. How old shall you be? In my country How old? How old? How old? Your Majesty, you see I'm 153. What? What? What? 153. When were you borned? When was I Borned. Borned in 1709. 1862. 1709. 153. Fine! Very fine. How long you been married? Uh How long? Many years. How many grandchildren shall you have? How many? How many? How many? You have not any. I beat. I beat. You are a very clever man, sir. I make better questions than she make answer. You do not be afraid to make joke with the king? It would not be flattering to His Majesty if I were afraid of him. Not to be afraid is a good thing in scientific mind. I think maybe you will make very fine schoolteaching. You are part of plan I have for bringing to Siam what is good in Western culture. Already I have bring printing press here for printing. Yes, I know, Your Majesty. How you know? Before I signed our agreement, I found out all I could about Your Majesty's ambitions for Siam. This is scientific. You are pleased with your apartment in palace? They are quite comfortable, Your Majesty, for the time being, but my young son and I found it rather confining with the Amazons guarding the doors and not permitting us to leave. Strangers cannot be allowed to roam around palace before presentment to king. You could look out of windows. We have done that, Your Majesty. We've seen New Year celebrations, royal cremations ceremonies, et cetera, et cetera. Uh, what is this et cetera? According to the dictionary, it means "and the rest," all the things you've been doing while we were waiting, the fireworks. Fireworks, best fireworks I ever see at funeral! How you like my acrobats? Splendid, Your Majesty, best acrobats I've ever seen at funeral. Ha! Have children prepare for presentation to schoolteacher! How many children have you, Your Majesty? I have only...67 altogether. I begin very late. But you shall not teach all of them. You shall teach only children of mothers who are in favor of king. Yes, Your Majesty, about our agreement? Ah, Lady Thiang. Madam Leonowens, this is Lady Thiang, head wife. There's a happy land far, far away Where saint in glory stand bright, bright as day "In the beginning, God created the heaven and Earth." Missonary. Oh, a missionary taught you English. Yes, sir, missonary. Lady Thiang, you will help Madame Leonowens with her schoolteaching, and she in her turn shall teach you the better English. She is grateful to me for my kindness. Oh, I see. Uh, your Majesty, about our agreement TTuptim, you already speak well the English. She arrive today. She's present to me from king of Burma. She is a present? Madam, you have English books I can read? Of course I have. I wish most to read book called, "The Small House of Uncle Thomas." Is by American lady Harriet Beecher Stowe. A woman has written a book? A very wonderful book all about slavery. Ah. President Lincoln of America against slavery, no? Me, too. Slavery very bad thing. I think you will teach my wives, too, those wives who are in royal favor. I would be most happy to teach your wives, your Majesty, even though that was not part of our agreement. Speaking of our agreement reminds me there is one matter we have to settle, Your Majesty, about my house. Also, I will allow you to help me in my foreign correspondence. Yes, Your Majesty. I don't think you understand about the house, Your Majesty. For the time being House, house, house? What is this about house?! I want my house. You shall live in palace! You teach in palace! If you do not live in palace, you do not teach. And you go wherever you please! I do not care! You understand this? I understand this, Your Majesty, but if these are the only terms on which I've come Enough! You promised! I have no more time to talk! Talk to other women, wives! Oh, my goodness. Oh, gracious, what is the matter? What are they trying to do to me? They think you wear a big skirt like that because you shaped like that. Oh. No, I'm not. I'm not. They wish to know, sir, if you have children. One little boy. I have boy, too, Crown Prince Chaufa Chulalongkorn, heir to throne. I would be happy if you would teach children. Oh, I would like to very much. I came all the way from Singapore to do so, but II really cannot stay here. You could be great help to all here, sir. Lady Thiang, why do you call me "sir"? Because you scientific, not lowly like a woman. Do you all think women are more lowly than men? Well, I don't. I think women are just as good as men, just as intelligent... ...just as important! Please, sir, do not tell king. Make king angry. King seems to be angry already. King like you. Please, sir, you like king. He bad to you only if you do not agree to him. Oh, that lovely girl, he said she was a present. From king of Burma. I think she love another man, and if so, she never see other man again. Poor child. Oh, no, sir. She foolish child to wish for another man when she have king. But you can't help wishing for a man if he's the man you want. It is strange for schoolteacher to talk so romantic. Well, I suppose I am. I was very much in love with my husband, Tom. ...Tom. Tom. Tom. And once a woman is loved like that, she understands all other women who are in love, and she's on their side, too, even if she's a schoolteacher. Tom. Yes, Tom. Oh, he was pretty in face. Oh, dear, yes, he was very pretty in face. When I think of Tom I think about a night When the earth smelled of summer And the sky was streaked with white And the soft mist of England Was sleeping on a hill I remember this And I always will There are new lovers now On the same silent hill Looking on the same blue sea And I know Tom and I Are a part of them all And they're all a part of Tom And me Hello, young lovers, whoever you are I hope your troubles are few All my good wishes go with you tonight I've been in love like you Be brave, young lovers, and follow your star Be brave and faithful and true Cling very close to each other tonight I've been in love like you I know how it feels to have wings on your heels And to fly down the street in a trance You fly down the street on a chance that you'll meet And you meet Not really by chance Don't cry, young lovers Whatever you do Don't cry because I'm alone All of my memories are happy tonight I've had a love of my own I've had a love of my own like yours I've had a love Of my own The children, the children. They come for presentment to schoolteacher. But, Your Majesty, we've not solved my problem. Silence. You will sit here to meet royal children. Very well, Your Majesty. The royal princes and princesses! Oh! Oh! Ah. Oh, let's go. Psst. Be it ever so humble There's no place like home Be it ever so humble There's no place like home Chow, you wait! Father, I shall by late for school. You will recite proverb you have learned yesterday. A thought for the day East or west, home is best. East, west, home best. Means house! Always something about house! Every day for a month, are my children to be taught nothing more? Yesterday, we are taught that the world is a round ball, which spins on a stick through the middle. Everyone knows that the world rides on the back of a great turtle who keeps it from running into the stars. How can it be that everyone knows one thing if many people believe another thing? Then which is true? The world is a ball with stick through it, I believe. You believe? Does that mean you do not know? But he must know because he is king! Yeah. Someday, you too will be king. You too will know everything. But how do I learn, and when do I know that I know everything? When you are king! Now leave me. When you are king? I do not know. I find puzzlement in many important matters. Cambodia is lost to the French. Do I dare make treaty? One day, I wish to build a wall around Siam. Next day, I think maybe let the rest of world in. It is difficult. What would Queen Victoria do if she was King of Siam? What would President Lincoln of America do? I think that they are both puzzled like you, Sire. The girl from Burma, Tuptim, she serves me in all duties of a wife. Of what, then, do you complain? Sometimes I embrace this Tuptim, you know, I get no sign that she feels... honored by me. This is impossible! It is impossible! It is impossible. She is a puzzlement, and schoolteacher is puzzlement. Cambodia is lost to the French. I'm not sure. I'm not sure of anything. When I was a boy World was better spot What was so was so What was not was not Now I am a man World have changed a lot Some things nearly so Others nearly not There are times I almost think I am not sure of what I absolutely know Very often find confusion in conclusion I concluded long ago In my head are many facts which as a student I have studied to procure In my head are many facts of which I wish I was more certain I was sure Is a puzzlement Shall I join with other nations in alliance? If allies are weak, am I not best alone? If allies are strong with power to protect me Might they not protect me out of all I own? Is a danger to be trusting one another? One will seldom want to do what other wishes But unless someday somebody trust somebody There'll be nothing left on Earth excepting fishes There are times I almost think Nobody sure of what he absolutely knows Everybody find confusion in conclusion he concluded long ago And it puzzle me to learn that Though a man may be in doubt of what he know Very quickly will he fight He'll fight to prove that what he does not know is so Oh, oh Sometimes, I think that people going mad Oh, oh Sometimes, I think that people not so bad But no matter what I think I must go on living life As a leader of my kingdom I must go forth Be father to my children and husband to each wife Et cetera, et cetera, and so forth If my lord in heaven, Buddha, show the way Every day I try to live another day If my lord in heaven, Buddha, show the way Every day I do my best for one more day But is a puzzlement We work and work from week to week At the Royal Bangkok Academy And English words are all we speak At the Royal Bangkok Academy Now, that last line was, "English words are all we speak." I didn't quite understand. I want to hear the beginnings and ends of your words. One, two, three. And English words are all we speak At the Royal Bangkok Academy Let's spread out, children! Spread out. If we pay attention to our teacher And obey her every rule We'll be grateful for these golden years At our dear old school The Royal Bangkok Academy Our dear old school That's fine. Lady Thiang, will you start? Ah. Blue, ocean. Ocean. Ocean. Red, Siam. Siam. Siam. Here is King of Siam. Ah. Ah. In right hand is a weapon. Show how he destroy all who fight him! Siam! Green, Burma. Burma. Burma. Here is King of Burma. No clothes show how poor is king of Burma. Thank you, Lady Thiang. Uh, will you take my chair? Now, the map you've been looking at is an old one. Today, we have a surprise. Louis? A new map just arrived from England. It is a gift to us from His Majesty, your King. The lord of light. Ah, yes, the lord of light. The white is Siam. Siam not so small. Let me show you England. See? It's even smaller than Siam. Oh. Oh. For many years before I came here, Siam was to me that little white spot. But now I've lived here for more than a year, and I've met the people of Siam, and I'm learning to understand them. You like us? Oh, I like you very much, very much indeed. It's a very ancient saying But a true and honest thought That if you become a teacher By your pupils, you'll be taught As a teacher, I've been learning You'll forgive me if I boast And I've now become an expert On the subject I like most Getting to know you. Ah. Ah. Getting to know you Getting to know all about you Getting to like you Getting to hope you like me Getting to know you Putting it my way but nicely You are precisely my cup of tea Yes. Getting to know you Getting to feel free and easy When I am with you Getting to know what to say Haven't you noticed? Suddenly I'm bright and breezy Because of all the beautiful and new Things I'm learning about you Day by day Getting to know you Getting to know all about you Getting to like you Getting to hope you like me Getting to know you Putting it my way but nicely You are precisely My cup of tea! Oh. Yes. Getting to know you Getting to feel free and easy When I am with you Getting to know what to say Haven't you noticed? Suddenly I'm bright and breezy Because of all the beautiful and new Things I'm learning about you Day by day Mrs. Anna? Mrs. Anna? Mrs. Anna? Oh, II don't think Getting to know you Getting to feel free and easy When I am with you Getting to know what to say Haven't you noticed? Suddenly I'm bright and breezy Because of all the beautiful and new Things I'm learning about you Day by day Haven't you noticed? Suddenly I'm bright and breezy Because of all the beautiful and new Things I'm learning about you Day by day Oh, this started out to be a lesson. Now let's get back to work. Hmm? Aw. I know. What is that green up there? Oh. Oh, that is Norway. Norway. Norway. Norway. Norway is a very cold place. Sometimes, it is so cold that the lakes and the rivers freeze, and the water becomes so hard that you can walk on it. Walk on water? Yes, walk on water. How is it possible? Hard water! Not only is it hard, it's very slippery, too. When people walk on it, they fall down. And they slide. And not only do the lakes and the rivers freeze, but the raindrops as they fall are changed into small, white spots that look like lace. This is called snow. Snow? Snow. Snow? Spots of lace! Yes, Your Highness. The water freezes on the way down from the sky. And the raindrops turn into little stars. Yes, Your Highness. Some are shaped like stars, small and white. I do not believe such thing as snow! And I do not believe Siam is this big. And other countries so big. Siam is biggest country in world! Children! Children, please! What? What? What? How can schoolroom be so unscientific? Oh, Your Majesty, we've had a little misunderstanding. II was describing snow, and they refused to believe there was such a thing. Snow? Snow. Ah! From mountaintop. From the sky. From sky to mountaintop. Sire! Please, how does it come down from the sky? Like this! Like this! Like this. Thank you, Sire. I've seen picture. Switzerland! That's right, Your Majesty. Land all white with snow. Yes. Who does not believe this? Well, after all, they've never seen it. Never see? If they will know only what they see, why do we have a schoolroom? Rise! Do not ever let me hear of not believing teacher who I have bring here at high expense, £20 each month. 20 English pounds sterling! Children must learn. Teacher must teach, not waste time instructing children in silly English songs. Home sweet house, to remind me of breaking promises that I never made, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera! But, Your Majesty, you did promise me a house, a brick residence adjoining the royal palace. Those were your words in your letter. I do not remember such words! Well, I remember them! I will do remembering! Who is king? I remind you. You remember that? I do not know of any promise. I do not know anything about that. You are my servant. Oh, no. Your Majesty I say you are my servant! No, Your Majesty! That is not true. I am most certainly not your servant. I would say your mother has bad manners. Well, I would say your father has no manners at all! Louis! If you do not give me the house you promised me, I shall return to England. No! Don't leave! Don't leave! Please do not let her go away. I believe in snow. Ah! I let her do nothing except what is my pleasure. It is my pleasure you stay here. You stay here in palace, in palace! No, Your Majesty. I give you servants. I give you bigger room. That is not the point, Your Majesty. Why do you wish to leave these children, all of whom are loving you so extraordinarily? I don't wish to leave them. I love them, too, quite extraordinarily. But I cannot stay in a country where a promise has no meaning. I will hear no more about promise! A land where there is talk of honor and a wish for Siam to take her place among the modern nations of the world, where there is talk of great changes, but where everything still remains according to the wishes of the king! You will say no more! I will say no more because I have no more to say. Louis, come. So big a world. Siam very small. England very small. All people very small. No man big enough for to be alone. No man big enough. King. King is different. Where is Mrs. Anna? She will not be with us ever again. She has quarreled with the king. How can we meet if she is not with us? Mrs. Anna was our only friend, and if we We cannot be seen talking like this. Anyone can come in. Pretend we wait for her. If only we could stop pretending. We kiss in a shadow We hide from the Moon Our meetings are few And over too soon We speak in a whisper Afraid to be heard When people are near We speak not a word Lun Tha. Alone in our secret Together, we sigh For one smiling day to be free To kiss in the sunlight And say to the sky "Behold and believe what you see Behold how my lover Loves me" Tuptim, when can we meet again? When? It is not possible. We cannot meet alone ever. Not ever. We speak in a whisper Afraid to be heard When people are near us Speak not a word Alone in our secret Together we sigh For one smiling day to be free To kiss in the sunlight And say to the sky "Behold and believe what you see Behold how my lover Loves me" What is it? Someone was here. I had a feeling someone was watching us. Please go. Tuptim. Please! To kiss in the sunlight And say to the sky "Behold and believe what you see Behold how my lover Loves me" I am sorry we nearly fought just now. I am, too. Are you really going away? Mother plans to leave on the next sailing. I am not sure my father will allow your mother to go. I am not sure whether my mother will allow your father not to allow her to go. Why does not your mother admit that she was wrong? I don't believe my mother thinks she was wrong. It begins to look as if people do not know when they are right or wrong, even after they have grown up. I have noticed that, too. It's a puzzlement. When I left my father a little while ago, he seemed uncertain about many things. I don't believe that grownups are ever certain. They only talk as if they are certain. There are times I almost think they are not sure of what they absolutely know I believe they are confused about conclusions They concluded long ago If my father and your mother are not sure What they absolutely know Can you tell me why they fight? They fight to prove That what they do not know is so Oh Aah! Sometimes, I think that people going mad Ah, oh Sometimes, I think that people not so bad But no matter what I think, I must go on living life And someday as a leader I must go forth Be father to my children and husband to each wife Et cetera, et cetera, and so forth If my Lord in Heaven, Buddha, show the way Every day I try to live another day If my Lord in Heaven, Buddha, show the way Every day, I do my best for one more day But Is a puzzlement. Your servant, your servant, indeed, I'm not your servant Although you give me less than servant's pay I'm a free and independent "employay" Employee. Because I'm a woman, you think, like every woman I have to be a slave, a concubine You conceited, selfindulgent "libertyne" Libertine. How I wish I called him that right to his face Libertine, and while we're on the subject, Sire There are certain goingson around this place That I wish to tell you I do not admire I do not like polygamy or even moderate bigamy I realize that in your eyes That clearly makes a prig of me But I am from a civilized land called Wales Where men like you are kept in county jails In your pursuit of pleasure You have mistresses who treasure you They have no ken of other men Beside whom they can measure you A flock of sheep and you the only ram No wonder you're the wonder of Siam Oh, I'm rather glad I didn't say that, not with the women right there, oh, and the children. The children, the children I'll not forget the children No matter where I go, I'll always see Those little faces looking up At me At first, when I started to teach They were shy and remained out of reach But lately, I've thought one or two have been caught By a word I have said or a sentence I've read And I've heard an occasional question That implied at the least a suggestion That the work I was trying to do Was beginning to show with a few That Prince Chulalongkorn is very like his father He's stubborn but inquisitive and smart I must leave this place before they break My heart I must leave this place Before they break My heart Oh, my goodness. I had no idea it was so late. Shall I tell you what I think of you? You're spoiled. You're a conscientious worker, but you're spoiled. Giving credit where it's due There is much I like in you But it's also very true that you're spoiled Everybody is always bowing to the king Everybody has to grovel to the king By your Buddha, you are blessed By your ladies, you're caressed But the one who loves you best is the king All this bowing and kowtowing to remind you of your royalty I find a most disgusting exhibition I wouldn't ask a Siamese cat to demonstrate his loyalty By taking this ridiculous position How would you like it if you were a man Playing the part of a toad Crawling around on your elbows and knees Eating the dust in the road? Toads, toads, all of your people are toads Yes, Your Majesty, no, Your Majesty Tell us how low to go, Your Majesty Make some more decrees, Your Majesty Don't let us up off our knees, Your Majesty Give us a kick if you please, Your Majesty Give us a kick if you would, Your Majesty Oh, that was good, Your Majesty. Ugh. Who is it? Mrs. Anna, it is I, Lady Thiang. At this hour of the night? Uh, come in, Lady Thiang. Mrs. Anna, will you go to king? Now? Has he sent for me? No, but he would be glad to see you. He is a deeply wounded man. No one has ever spoke to him as you did today in his schoolroom. Lady Thiang, no one has ever behaved to me as His Majesty did today in the schoolroom. And there is a more distressing thing. Our agents in Singapore have found letters to British Government from people whose greedy eyes are on Siam. They describe King as a barbarian. They suggest make Siam a protectorate. That is outrageous. He is many things I do not like, but he is not a barbarian. Then you will help him. You mean advise him? It must not sound like advice. King cannot take advice. And if you go to him, he will not bring up subject. You must bring it up. I cannot go to him. That is against all my principles, certainly not without his having asked for me. He wish to be newblood king with Western ideas, but it is hard for him, Mrs. Anna, and there is something else Princess Tuptim. I do not tell him, for his sake. I deal with this my own way. But for these other things, he need he need help, Mrs. Anna. He has you. He could be great man, but he need special help. He need you. Oh, Lady Thiang, please don't think I'm being stubborn. I cannot go to him. I will not. What more can I say to you? This is a man who thinks with his heart His heart is not always wise This is a man who stumbles and falls But this is a man who tries This is a man you'll forgive and forgive And help and protect As long as you live He will not always say What you would have him say But now and then he'll say Something wonderful The thoughtless things he'll do Will hurt and worry you Then all at once He'll do something wonderful He has a thousand dreams That won't come true You know that he believes in them And that's enough for you You'll always go along Defend him when he's wrong And tell him when he's strong He is wonderful He'll always need your love And so he'll get your love A man who needs your love Can be Wonderful Did you succeed? Will she go to him? She will go. She knows he needs her. Tell him. I will tell him she's anxious to come. I will tell him it is she who needs him. Yes. Yes, and that that will also be true. This woman knows many things, but this, I think she does not know. She'll always go along Defend him when he's wrong And tell him when he's strong That he is wonderful He'll always need her love And so he'll get her love A man who needs your love Can be Wonderful Your Majesty? Your Majesty? Your Majesty is reading the Bible? Ah, Mrs. Anna, I think your Moses shall have been a fool. Moses? Moses, Moses, Moses! Here it stands written by him that the world was created in six days! You know and I know it took many ages to create world. I think your Moses shall have been a fool to have written so. What is your opinion? Your Majesty, the Bible was not written by men of science but by men of faith. It was their explanation of the miracle of creation, which is the same miracle, whether it took six days or many centuries. Hmm. You have come to apologize? I am sorry, Your Majesty. I'm am not here to Good. You apologize. Your Majesty I accept. Your Majesty, nothing has been said that can alter the fact that in my country, anyone who makes a promise must keep it. Silence. Tell me about President Lincoln of America. How is he trained to be president? I believe he studied very hard. He educated himself. Shall Mr. Lincoln be winning this war? He's fighting a peasant! Oh, no one knows, Your Majesty. Does he have enough guns and elephants for transporting same? I don't think they have elephants in America, Your Majesty. No elephant? Then I shall send him some. Write letter to Mr. Lincoln. Now? Now! When else? Now is always best time. Very well, Your Majesty. From Phra Maha Mongkut, by the blessing of the highest superagency in the world of the whole universe, the king of Siam Do you not have any respect for me? Why do you stand over my head? I cannot stand all the time, and in this country, no one's head shall be higher than King's. From now on, in presence, you shall so conduct yourself like all other subjects. You mean on the floor? I am sorry, Your Majesty. I shall try very hard not to let my head be higher than yours, but I simply cannot grovel on the floor. I couldn't possibly work that way or think. You are very difficult woman! Mm. But you will observe care that your head shall never be higher than mine. If I shall sit, you shall sit. If I shall kneel, you shall kneel, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Very well, Your Majesty. Is promise? Is promise. Good. To His Royal Presidency of the United States in America, uh, Abraham Lincoln you fix that? Yes. Uhhuh. It has occurred to us It has occurred to us Hmm? It has occurred to us It has occurred to us that if several pairs of young male elephants were turned loose in the forests of America, after a while, they would increase Your Majesty. Hmm? Hmm? Just male elephants? You put in details. Tonight, my mind is on other matters, very important matters. Oh. Uh, anything you want to discuss with me, Your Majesty? Why should I discuss important matters with a woman? Very well, Your Majesty. Then I shall say good night. Good night. Your Majesty? What? What? What? I was wondering, uh, when the boat arrived from Singapore yesterday... Singapore, huh? ...was there any news from abroad? Yes! Yes, news! Yes, there are news. They call me barbarian. Who? Certain parties who would use this as excuse to steal my country. Suppose you are Queen Victoria, and somebody tell you, "King of Siam is barbarian." Do you believe? Well, Your Majesty You will. You will. You will. You will believe I am barbarian, because there is no one to speak otherwise. Oh, this is a lie! It is a false lie! Yes, well, what have you decided to do about it, Your Majesty? You...guess. Well, if someone was sending a big lie about me to England, I should try very hard to send the truth to England. Is Is that what you've decided to do, Your Majesty? Y-Yes! Yes! This is what I have decided to do, but how? Guess how I shall do this. Well, my guess would be that when Sir Edward Ramsey arrives here Uh, uh, R-Ramsey? Ramsey? The British diplomat. Ah. Yeah. On way from Singapore. We wrote to him last month. When he's here, I shall take opportunity of expressing my opinion of English thieves who wish to steal Siam! I shall show him who is barbarian! What is this face you put on? Your Majesty, my guess is that you will not fight with Sir Edward. I will not? No, Your Majesty. You will entertain him and his party in an especially grand manner. In this way, you'll make them all witnesses in your favor. They will return to England and report to the Queen that you are not a barbarian. Naturally. Yes. Naturally. This is what I have intended to do. It's the only way to get the better of the British. You'll stand up to them, put your best foot forward. It's only an expression, Your Majesty. It means dress up in your best clothes and show them your most intelligent men and your most beautiful women. Edward admires beautiful women. Edward? You call him this? Oh, we're old friends. I knew him in Bombay before I was married. Shall it be proper for the British dignitaries to see my women with no shoes on their feet? No. Sir Ramsey will go back and tell the queen I am barbarian. Why do you not think of this? We shall dress them up, European fashion. You mean dress them in dresses? How many women can I have sew for me? All women in kingdom. How many dresses? That depends on how many ladies are chosen by Your Majesty. You shall tell me which of my women are most like Europeans for dressing like same! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Everybody, wives, wives, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera! Well, I wonder how much time we shall have. Sir Ramsey's gunboat last reported off of Songkhla. Let us say we have one week. One week? Oh, Your Majesty, I don't think One week? In this time, whole world was created, Moses says! Are there any details I do not think of so far? We must give them a fine dinner, a European dinner... Oh, I was going to. ...and a ball with music. Music and dancing. Yes, Your Majesty, dancing! Why do you not think of dancing? It's a very inspired idea, Your Majesty. Oh, we can also give them a theatrical performance. Tuptim has written a play, a version of "Uncle Tom's Cabin." We shall show them who is barbarian! Line up! Line up! Line up! Lady Thiang, on Saturday next at 9:00 postmeridian, we shall give fine dinner, European dinner, for probably 20 people. What, what, what? Am I to be annoyed by children at this moment? For the next week, the men and women of my kingdom will work without sleeping until all is ready. Lady Thiang, tell this to everyone. Above all, I must not be worried by anything! Look, Your Majesty! Who can this be? Fireworks, fireworks at this hour in the morning? No one may order but me! Your Majesty, the British, their gunboat. They attack? No. They salute, and we answer with fireworks. It is Sir Edward Ramsey and his party. Now? Now. They must have come direct from Songkhla, no stops. No stops. Tell them to go back. We are not ready! Not ready, Your Majesty? Oh, you you do not know. You do not know. I had plan, best idea I ever did! Oh, Your Majesty, we can still do this. You can do it. When English arrive, we will put them to bed. Tomorrow morning, we shall send them on sightseeing trip! We shall start right now at this minute. Work, work. We have only 18 hours, but I shall do it somehow. I shall do it. You shall help me. Oh, Priest, first, we shall ask help from Buddha. Bow to him. Bow, bow, bow. Oh, Buddha, give us the aid of your strength and wisdom Oh, Buddha, give us the aid of your strength and wisdom And help us to prove to the visiting English That we are extraordinary and remarkable people And help us to prove to the visiting English That we are extraordinary and remarkable people Help also Mrs. Anna to keep awake For scientific sewing of dresses Even though she be only a woman and Christian And therefore unworthy of your interest Help also Mrs. Anna to keep awake For scientific sewing of dresses A promise is a promise. Even though she be only a woman and Christian Your head cannot be higher than mine. A promise. And therefore unworthy of your interest And, Buddha, I promise I shall give this unworthy woman... a house. Oh. A house all her own, a brick residence adjoining the Royal Palace according to agreement, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And, Buddha, I promise I shall give this unworthy woman A house of her own, a brick residence Adjoining the Royal Palace, according to agreement Et cetera Et cetera Et cetera Ladies, ladies, clear everything away, quickly now. Lady Thiang, what is this costume? Here is East. Here is West. I have too much work to do. I cannot move in swollen skirt. Lady Thiang, why must we dress like this for British? Whatever Mrs. Anna say is wise and good. But this is a puzzlement. To prove we're not barbarians, they dress us up like savages To prove we're not barbarians, we wear a funny skirt To prove we're not barbarians They dress us up like savages To prove we're not barbarians, we wear a funny skirt Western people funny, Western people funny Western people funny, of that, there is no doubt They feel so sentimental about the Oriental They always try to turn us inside down and upside out Upside out and inside down To bruise and pinch our little toes Our feet are cramped in leather shoes They'd break if we had brittle toes But now they only hurt To bruise and pinch our little toes Our feet are cramped in leather shoes They'd break if we had brittle toes But now they only hurt Western people funny, Western people funny Western people funny, too funny to be true They think they civilize us whenever they advise us To learn to make the same mistake That they are making, too They think they civilize us whenever they advise us To learn to make the same mistake That they are making, too They make quite a few Lady Thiang, here are the napkins for dinner. Will you put them on the table? Oh. Thank you. Oh, no, no. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, no. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, no, no, no. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Ladies, turn around. Let me see how you look. Aah! What's the big trouble now? I forgot. They have practically no undergarments. Undergarments? Of what importance are undergarments at this time? Of great importance. Are you wearing undergarments? Of course, Your Majesty. That a woman has no legs is useless to pretend. Wide and swollen skirts. The wide skirt is symbolic. It is the circle within which a female is protected. This is necessary? Mmhmm. Englishmen are so aggressive? I did not know. I said it was symbolic. Uh, European dinner service is on table. Knife, fork, spoon. Yes, sir. One for each guest, just one. This is what you are going to wear? Yes. Do you like it? This is what all the other visiting ladies shall look like? Most of them, I believe. You certain? This it customary, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera? Yes, I am certain it is customary. What is so extraordinary about bare shoulders? Your own ladies Uh, yes. But is different. They do not wear so many coverings up on other parts of body, et cetera, um, therefore Therefore what? Is different. Well, I'm sorry His Majesty does not approve. I do not say I do not approve, but I do say The English, they are in palace. At dinner table, we must make great conversation. You begin with Moses. Remember, Courtwright is the editor of a newspaper in Singapore. Hello, Anna, my dear. Oh, hello Oh! You Majesty, may I present Sir Edward Ramsey? Your Majesty. How are you, Anna? I am so sorry that my ladies have not given good impression. On the contrary, Your Majesty. I have never received so good an impression in so short a time. You have most attractive pupils, Anna. Well you must meet my younger pupils, His Majesty's children. They're making wonderful progress. I shall be delighted. Uh, how many children have you, Your Majesty? 77 now. I'm not married very long. Next month expecting three more. No problem at all about an heir to the throne, is there? Ah, yes. Well, I suppose I ought to apologize for wandering into this room. You see, the rest of the party were ahead of me. We're so glad you decided to visit us to visit His Majesty, I mean, of course. Oh, yes. Well, it was your postscript to His Majesty's letter that Postscript? His Majesty was most happy when you decided to accept his invitation, weren't you, Your Majesty? I was happy? Your Majesty, dinner is about to be served, and I would first like to present your guests to you in the reception room. Dinner, dinner, dinner. Oh, you have met? Your Excellency. Anna, my dear, you're looking lovelier than ever. Oh, thank you, Edward. Found a job to do, eh? Yes. People you can help? Well, that's it, isn't it? Extraordinary how one gets attached to people who need one. Do you hear that? Do you know we danced to that once? Bombay. Still dance? Oh, no, not very often. Well, you should. Edward, I think we'd better get back Are you sure you don't ever get homesick? No, Edward. I told you. There's nothing for me there, no one. Anna, do you remember I once asked you to marry me, before Tom came along? Oh, dear Edward. Forgive me. Dancing after dinner. I'm sorry, sir. I'm afraid I started talking over old times. It was my impression Mrs. Anna would be of help for seating guests at dinner table, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Well, in that case, we'd better be going in, Anna. Yes, better be going in, Anna. His Majesty made an interesting point about Moses the other day when he was reading the Bible. Princess Tuptim? The dinner is nearly over. The king and his English guests will be on their way to the theater soon. Should you not be there to begin your play? I came out here to memorize my lines. I think not, Princess. I have seen you and Lun Tha together. I do not tell king, for his sake. I do not wish to hurt him. But your lover will leave Siam...tonight. Tonight? Now go to the theater, Princess. Tuptim. Turn back and look the other way. I will stay here until she turns the corner. She has told me you will leave Siam tonight, but I don't believe her. It is true, Tuptim. They have ordered me onto the first ship that leaves for Burma, and it is tonight. What will we do? You are coming with me. I? You have been a slave long enough! Lun Tha, shh! Secret police will all be at the theater. Meet me here after your play. Everything is arranged. I cannot believe it. I can. It will be just as I have pictured it a million times. I have dreamed that your arms are lovely I have dreamed what a joy you'll be I have dreamed every word you'll whisper When you're close, close to me How you look in the glow of evening I have dreamed and enjoyed the view In these dreams I've loved you so That by now I think I know What it's like to be loved by you I will love being loved by you Alone and awake, I've looked at the stars The same that smiled on you And time and again I've thought all the things That you were thinking, too I have dreamed that your arms are lovely I have dreamed what a joy you'll be I have dreamed every word you'll whisper When you're close, close to me How you look in the glow of evening I have dreamed and enjoyed the view In these dreams I've loved you so That by now I think I know What it's like to be loved by you Loved by you I will love being loved By you Tuptim. Mrs. Anna? They are looking for you at the theater. I guessed you'd both be here. I ran out to warn you. I do think you're being rather reckless. Yes. I will go. Mrs. Anna, I must say goodbye to you now. Oh. Gracious. Anyone would think she never expected to see me again. Mrs. Anna? We are leaving tonight. Leaving? How? Don't ask me how. It's better if you don't know. But, Mrs. Anna, we shall never forget you. Never. God bless you both. I know how it feels to have wings on your heels And to fly down a street in a trance You fly down a street on the chance that you'll meet And you meet Not really by chance Don't cry, young lovers, whatever you do Don't cry because I'm alone All of my memories are happy tonight I've had a love of my own I've had a love of my own like yours I've had a love Of my own Your Majesty... and honorable guests, I beg to put before you, "Small House of Uncle Thomas." Small house of Uncle Thomas Small house of Uncle Thomas Written by a woman Harriet Beecher Stowe Small House is in kingdom of Kentucky, ruled by most wicked king in all America, Simon of Legree. Your Majesty, I beg to put before you loving friends. Uncle Thomas. Dear old Uncle Thomas Little Eva. Blessed little Eva Little Topsy. Mischiefmaker, Topsy Happy people. Very happy people Happy people Happy people Your Majesty, I beg to put before you one who is not happy the slave... Eliza. Poor Eliza Poor Eliza Poor unfortunate slave Eliza's lord and master, King Simon of Legree. She hates her Lord and master and fears him. This king has sold her lover to faraway province of "Oheeo." Lover's name is George. George Baby in her arms is also called George. George Eliza say she run away and look for lover George. George So she bid goodbye to friends... ...and start on her escape. The escape. Run, Eliza Run, Eliza Run from Simon Poor Eliza running, and run into a rainstorm! Comes a mountain. Climb, Eliza Hide, Eliza! Hide from Simon Hide in forest Poor Eliza. Poor Eliza Poor Eliza Poor Eliza Poor Eliza Poor Eliza Eliza very tired. Your Majesty, I regret to put before you King Simon of Legree. Because one slave has run away, Simon beating every slave. Simon clever man. He decide to hunt Eliza not only with soldiers, but with scientific dogs who sniff and smell and thereby discover all who run from King. Run, Eliza, run Run, Eliza, run Run from Simon, run Run, Eliza Run, run Run from Simon Run, run Poor Eliza Run from Simon Eliza, run Eliza, run from Simon, run Eliza, run Poor Eliza! Eliza, run from Simon, run Run, Eliza Run from Simon Run, Eliza Run from Simon Run, Eliza run, run Ah! Eliza come to river. Eliza come to river! Poor Eliza Who can save her? Only Buddha Save her, Buddha, save her What will Buddha do? Buddha make a miracle! Buddha send an angel down. Angel make the wind blow cold... ...make the river water hard, hard enough to walk upon. Buddha make a miracle. Praise to Buddha Angel show her how to walk on frozen water. Now, as a token of his love, Buddha make a new miracle. Praise to Buddha Send from Heaven stars and blossoms. Praise to Buddha Praise to Buddha Look like lace upon the sky. Praise to Buddha Praise to Buddha Praise to Buddha So Eliza cross river, hidden by this veil of lace. Forgot to tell you name of miracle snow. Of a sudden she can see wicked Simon of Legree, sliding 'cross the river fast with his bloodhounds and his slaves! What has happened to the river? What has happened to the river? Buddha has called out the sun! Buddha has called out the sun Sun has made the water soft Wicked Simon and his slaves Fall in river and are drowned On other side of river is pretty city, Canada, where Eliza sees lovely small house. Guess who lives in house? Uncle Thomas. Dear old Uncle Thomas Little Eva Blessed little Eva Little Topsy. Mischiefmaker Topsy Lover George. Faithful lover George Who is looking like angel to Eliza. They all have escaped from wicked Simon and make happy reunion. Topsy glad that Simon die. Topsy dance for joy. I tell you what Harriet Beecher Stowe say that Topsy say "I spects I's the wickedest critter in the world." But I do not believe Topsy is wicked critter, because I too am glad for death of king, of any king who pursues a slave who is unhappy and wishes to join her lover. And, Your Majesty, I wish to say to you Your Majesty... ...and honorable guests... I will tell you end of story. Is very sad ending. Buddha has saved Eliza, but with the blessings of Buddha also comes sacrifice. Poor little Eva Poor little Eva Poor unfortunate child Poor little Eva Is Buddha's wish that Eva come to him... Poor little Eva ...and thank him personally for saving of Eliza and baby. Poor unfortunate child And so she die... ...and go to arms of Buddha. Praise to Buddha Praise to Buddha Well, that evening was a great success, Your Majesty. I enjoyed Princess Tuptim's play immensely. The play did not succeed with me. It is immoral for a king to drown when pursuing a slave who deceives him. Immoral. Tuptim shall know of my displeasure. Your conversation at dinner was most amusing. I was forced to laugh myself. I was so funny. Her Majesty Queen Victoria will be very glad to know that we have come to such... felicity of agreement about Siam. Very happy I am thereof. Very happy. Well, I think now, with your permission, I shall take my leave. Goodbye, Anna, my dear. It was lovely to see you again. Goodbye, Edward. Well, Your Majesty! It is all over! Oh, well, yes. May I remove my shawl? It's a very hot night. Oh, I am so pleased about everything. I wish to say you have been a great help to me in this endeavor. I wish to make gift. I have hope you will accept. Put it on finger. Put it on. Put it on. Put it on. Your Majesty. I do not know what to say. When one does not know what to say, it is a time to be silent. A white elephant has been discovered in the forests of Ayutthaya. You regard that as a good omen, don't you? Yes. Everything going well with us. Everything going well with us. Who, who, who? It is I, Your Majesty. Your Majesty, secret police are here. They would make report to you. Secret police? You will wait here. Your finger shines. Oh, yes. The King. II did not know what to say to him. Women in my country don't accept gifts from men. Of course, he is the king. Actually, it places me in a rather embarrassing position. I was intending to ask him for a rise in salary, and now I And now it will be difficult to ask. Very. I don't suppose you would speak to him for me, about my rise in salary, I mean. I think I shall do this for you because this is a strange world in which men and women can be very blind about things nearest to them. Thank you, Your Excellency. I don't understand what you mean. No, but that does not matter, and I do not think he will rise your salary anyway. Ha! Good news and bad news come together. You will stay up all night until we have further report on Tuptim. I have intended to do so, Your Majesty. Perhaps I'd better go, too. No, no, no, no, I wish to talk with you. Is there something wrong with Tuptim? I do not know. This is more important. Secret police have served coffee after dinner and listen as they talk and reported conversation of British dignitaries. You have been spying on your guests? How else can one find the truth? It appears I have made excellent impression. It is clear they do not think me barbarian. Oh, this is what you intended to prove. What we intended to prove. Tuptim. What about her? You know something about this? She's missing from palace. I knew she was unhappy. Why unhappy? What is greater honor for young girl than to be in palace of king? Your Majesty, if Tuptim is caught, shall she be punished? What would you do, if you were king like me? I believe I would give her a chance to explain. I think I would try not to be too harsh. Huh? Your Majesty, of what interest to you is one girl like Tuptim? She's just another woman, as a bowl of rice is just another bowl of rice, no different from any other bowl of rice. Now you understand about the women! No, no But British poets You're reading poetry, Your Majesty? Listen to this from your own poet, Alfred Tennyson. "Now folds the lily all her sweetness up and slips into the bosom of the lake. So fold thyself, my dearest, thou, and slip into my bosom and be lost in me." This is nonsense. A woman is a female who is human Designed for pleasing men, the human male A human male is pleased by many women All the rest you hear is fairy tale Then tell me how this fairy tale began, sir You cannot call it just a poet's trick Explain to me how many men are faithful And true to one wife only They are sick. But you do expect women to be faithful. Naturally. Why naturally? Because it is natural. It is like old Siamese rhyme. A girl must be like a blossom With honey for just one man A man must live like honeybee And gather all he can To fly from blossom to blossom A honeybee must be free But blossom must not ever fly From bee to bee to bee Your Majesty, I don't think I shall ever make it clear to you. We don't look on women as just human females. They are Well, take yourself. You're not just a human male. I am king. Exactly. So every man is like a king, and every woman like a queen when they love one another. This is sickly idea. This is a beautiful idea. We're brought up on it, of course. Oh, and a young girl at her first dance Young girl? They dance, too, like I see tonight, in arms of men not their husband. Yes. I will not permit. It's very exciting, when you're young. And you're sitting on a small gilt chair, your eyes lowered, terrified you'll be a wallflower. And then you see two black shoes, a white waistcoat, a face. It speaks. We've just been introduced I do not know you well But when the music started Something drew me to your side So many men and girls Are in each other's arms It made me think we might be Similarly occupied Shall we dance? On a bright cloud of music, shall we fly? Shall we dance? Shall we then say good night and mean goodbye? Or perchance When the last little star has left the sky Shall we still be together With our arms around each other? And shall you be my new romance? On the clear understanding That this kind of thing can happen Shall we dance? Shall we dance? Shall we dance? Oh, Your Majesty, I'm sorry. Why do you stop? You dance pretty. Go on! Go on! No, no, Your Majesty, I didn't realize I was Well, after all, I am not a dancing girl. In England, we don't That is, a girl would not dance while a man is looking at her. But she will dance with a strange man, holding hands, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Yes, and not always a strange man. Sometimes a very good friend. Good. We dance together. You show me. You teach. You teach. Well, it's quite simple, the polka. You count one, two, three and one, two, three and one, two, three and Shall we dance? One, two, three and? Ah! On a bright cloud of music shall we fly? One, two, three and. Shall we dance? One, two, three and. Shall we then say good night and mean goodbye? One, two, three. Or perchance When the last little star has left the sky Oh. Shall we still be together With our arms around each other And shall you be my new Romance? Romance On the clear understanding that this kind of can happen Shall we dance? Shall we dance? Shall we dance? 1, 2, 3, and, 1, 2, 3, and... 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3 1, 2, 3, and What's wrong?! Ah, I forget "and." This time, I remember. 1, 2, 3, and, 1, 2, 3, and, 1, 2, 3, and, 1, 2, 3. Oh, that's splendid, Your Majesty. Oh, it's splendid! You have thrown me off count. 1, 2, 3, and, 1, 2, 3, and, 1, 2, 3, and, 1, 2, 3. No, no, no, it is not right. Yes, it is. You are doing wonderfully. No, no, not the way I see Europeans dancing tonight. Yes, it was. It was just like that. No, were not holding two hands like this. No, as a matter of fact Was like this, no? Yes. Come. Good. We try again? This time, I do better. Very well, Your Majesty. Why do you burst through my door without waiting? Your Majesty, we have found Tuptim. Where is she? Secret police are questioning her. Now you have found her, what will you do with her? I will do what is usually done in such event! What is that? When it happens, you will know! No, please, no! Mrs. Anna, please do not let them beat me. Do not let them, please! She was found on Chinese sailing ship. See? She wears disguise of priest. Who gave you this robe? It is believed she was running away with man who brought her here from Burma. Dishonor, dishonor, dishonor! He was not found on boat. Where is this man, huh? I do not know. You will tell us. Aah! Where we will find him, you will tell us! I do not know! It is believed you are lovers with this man. I was not lovers with this man. Soon we will have the truth of this man! No! Stop it. Please, no. Stop it now. Stop it. It would be better if you understand at once that this matter does not concern you. Oh, but it does. It does dreadfully, because of her, and even more because of you. You waste my time. I'm the law in such a matter! That is what I was afraid of. Your Majesty, II beg of you, don't punish this girl. Don't throw away all you've done, all you've built for yourself and your country, with such labor against such odds. If you do, you will never be able to get it back again. I will show you! No! Oh, she's only a child. She was running away because she was unhappy. Can't you understand that? This girl hurt your vanity. She didn't hurt your heart. Down, down, down. Oh, you haven't got a heart! You've never loved anyone, and you never will. Do it! I cannot believe you're going to do this dreadful thing. You do not believe, huh? Maybe you will believe when you hear her screaming as you run down the hall! No, no, please, no! I'm not going to run down the hall. I'm going to stay here, and I'm going to watch you. You watch. I do this all myself. Oh. You are a barbarian. I am king, as I was born to be, and Siam to be governed in my way, not English way, not French way, not Chinese way! My way. Barbarian, you say? There is no barbarian worse than a weak king! I am strong! You hear? Strong! The man, the lover, has been found. He is dead. Dead? No. No! Then I shall join him soon. Soon. I don't understand you, you or your king. I shall never understand him. You, you have destroyed him. You have destroyed king. He can never be anything that he was before. You have taken all this away from him! You have destroyed him. You have destroyed the king! The next boat that comes to the Port of Bangkok, no matter where it goes, I shall be on it. Give this back to His Majesty. I wish you have never come to Siam! So do I! So do I! Captain Orton, your ship has docked in time. We are welcoming Elephant Prince to Bangkok. White Elephant Day? So that's it. I just passed the young prince. But where's the king? I didn't see him in the procession. The king is very ill, very ill. Your Highness, your father is getting worse. Worse? Mother, what is it with my father? It is his heart. And also, he does not seem to want to live. Mother, I am frightened. I'm frightened because I love my father and also because, if he dies, I shall be king, and I do not know how to be. Many men learn this after they become kings. I have been thinking much on things Mrs. Anna used to tell us in classroom, of slavery, et cetera, et cetera, and I think also on what she has said of religion and how it is a good and noble concern that each man find for himself that which is right and that which is wrong. These are good things to remember, my son, and it would be good to remember the one who taught them. Chulalongkorn! Lady Thiang, how nice of you to come to say goodbye. We were down at the ship, seeing that all our boxes were on it. Captain Orton must sail with the tide. I did not come only to say goodbye. Mrs. Anna, I come for one who must see you. Oh, you must go to him, Mrs. Anna. When he heard you were sailing, he started to write this letter. All day he has been writing. And it was difficult for him, madam. It was very difficult. He has commanded that I bring it to you. Please to read it to all of us. I would like to hear what my father has said. "While I am lying here, I think perhaps I die. This heart, which you say I have not got, is a matter of concern. It occurs to me that there shall be nothing wrong that men shall die, for all that shall matter about man is that he shall have tried his utmost best. In looking back, I discover that you think much on those people who require that you live up to best of self. You have spoken truth to me always, and for this, I have often lost my temper on you. But now I do not wish to die without saying this gratitude, et cetera, et cetera. I think it very strange that a woman shall have been most earnest help of all. But, Mrs. Anna, you must remember that you have been a very difficult woman and much more difficult than generality." I must go to him. Mother, I thought you and the king were very angry with each other. We were, Louis. Now he's dying, does that make you better friends? Well, I suppose it does. We can't hurt each other anymore. I didn't know he hurt you. When two people are as different as we are, they're almost bound to hurt each other. He always frightened me. Oh, I wish you had known him better, Louis. You could have been great friends. In some ways, he was just as young as you. Was he as good a king as he could have been? Oh, Louis, I don't think any man has ever been as good a king as he could have been, but this one tried. He tried very hard. You really like him, don't you, Mother? Yes, Louis, I like him very much. Very much, indeed. We can go in now. Many, many month I do not see you, Mrs. Anna, and now I die. Oh, no, Your Majesty. This is not scientific. Mrs. Anna, I know if I die or do not die, you are leaving Siam. When? Very soon. In fact, I have only a few minutes more. You are glad for this? People of Siam and royal children are not glad. All are in great affliction of your departure. I shall miss them. You shall miss them, but you shall be leaving. I too am leaving, but I'm not walking onto a boat with my own feet of my own free will. I'm just leaving. Why is your head above mine? I'm not afraid of that which is happening to me. Make believe you brave is always good idea. You are very brave, Your Majesty, very brave. Here is something belonging to you. Put it on finger. Put it on. Put it on. Please wear it. Good evening, my children. Good evening, my father. Good evening, my father. Stop! Stop! Did you come to see your father or Mrs. Anna? It is all right, Lady Thiang. It is suitable. Uh, Princess Ying Yaowalak has composed a letter for Mrs. Anna. She does not know how to write. She only make up words. Speak letter now. Say it. Say it. "Dear friend and teacher, my goodness gracious, do not go away. We are in great need of you. We are like one blind. Do not let us fall down in darkness. Continue good and sincere concern for us and lead us in right road. Your loving pupil, Princess Ying Yaowalak." Hush, children. When you are afraid, make believe you brave. You tell them how you do. Tell them. Let it be last thing you teach. Whenever I feel afraid I hold my head erect And whistle a happy tune So no one will suspect I'm afraid While shivering in my shoes I strike a careless pose And whistle a happy tune And no one ever knows I'm afraid You whistle. Whistle. You show them. Mother, it's the boat. It's time. Oh, Louis, go down and ask Captain Orton to take all our boxes off the ship and have everything moved back into our house! Silence! There is no reason for this demonstration for schoolteacher realizing her duty... Oh, my goodness. ...for which I pay her exorbitant monthly salary of twenty...five pounds. Chulalongkorn, come. Mrs. Anna, you take notes. You take notes from next king. Well, well, well, suppose you are king. Is there nothing you would do, huh? Uh, I... ...would make proclamations. Yes. Yes. First, I would proclaim for coming New Year fireworks. Also boat races. Boat races? Why boat races with New Year celebration? I like boat races! And, Father, I would make a second proclamation. Well, go on. What is second proclamation? Make it. Make it. Regarding custom of bowing to king in fashion of lowly toad... ...I do not believe this is good thing, causing embarrassing fatigue of body, degrading experience of soul, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. This is very bad thing. I believe. You are angry with me, my Father? Why do you ask question? If you are king, you are king. You do not ask question of sick man, nor of woman. This proclamation against bowing I believe to be your fault. Oh, I hope so, Your Majesty. I do hope so. Up! Rise up! Up, up, up. It has been said there shall be no bowing for showing respect of king. It has been said by one who has been trained for royal government. No bowing like toad, no crouching, no crawling. This does not mean, however, that you do not show respect for king. You will stand with shoulders square back and chin high like this. You will bow to me, the gentlemen in this way, only bending the waist. The ladies will make dip. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
