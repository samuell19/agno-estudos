It was clear and warm today. Seoul's temperature was 21℃. It will be 24℃ tomorrow. May 1st, the day after tomorrow, will feel hot at 26℃. In Daegu, it was 25℃ today. It will be 27℃ tomorrow. The day after that it will be 30℃. The weather is rather dry... Here we are. I know. The wallpaper is melting. This place is... This place must have been empty for a long time. It's the top floor, with no elevator. People don't even use it for storage. But you said that you want the cheapest place available. Will I be able to use this toilet? - It's way too... - Sit down, sit down. It's a standard-sized toilet. Let's try this. Move your legs, like this! Pooping like this won't be comfortable. You think so? Sir, I'm really sorry... - Could you lower my rent? - Just a little? Discount! Discount? That's up to your landlord, not me. - It won't fit! - Use your strength! - Hey... - Ow! Why does a bachelor need a king-sized bed? It's called preparation. You might be single your entire life. But I'm going to get married. Why are you so weak? It's hard to buy a used mattress of this size. I used an app to buy it for cheap. How much was it? - $250. - $250? That's expensive! You're too poor to meet girls! - At least get on my level. - What? Should I take this? You're too ugly to say something like that. - I'm going to use the toilet. - What? No! Don't be ridiculous. What's wrong? It's not possible for you. You can't even play the guitar. Why do you have a collection? It's so heavy. Why did you call us instead of a ladder truck, you crazy bastard? Yoon-seong, you have a dirty face and a dirty mouth. Look at Jae-young. He's ugly, but he's beautiful on the inside. Be more like him! You passed the audition for 'Dream Again'? Yeah. That's why I moved here. I need to prepare for the second round. Isn't it time to quit? You won't make it as a solo artist. He passed the first round! He's working hard, so don't say that. Especially not when he's eating. Seung-jin, this is your big chance. Go for it. I'll supply all of the supplements you need. It's not your hospital. Don't get into trouble. It's my dad's hospital, so it's as good as mine. Raise your voice! You should have ordered some alcohol, too. Are you an alcoholic with anger management issues? Why are you always yelling? Stop it. Let's just eat. Seung-jin, think of this as your last chance. And you two... Especially you! Don't pressure him. He's already desperate. Let's clink cans. Dream... Again! Not bad. It's atmospheric. It's really... Not bad at all. What... No way... Come on! Ghosts don't exist! They don't exist! How embarrassing. It's my first day here, and a ghost... No, ghosts don't exist. Damn it. Excuse me. You're here, right? I just moved here. If you're haunting this place, please show yourself. Please! You must be in there. I'll free you. I may be crying, but I love justice. Hold on. I have all these tools. I'll free you. I'll free you! Sorry... It's getting late, and it's dark. Everyone's asleep. I'll free you in the morning. Good night. I'm fine. I need to free the ghost. The sun is out. I'll free you now. Don't be scared. Hey! How pathetic... Why are you doing this to me? Who are you? Are you a ghost? I knew you were an idiot. What? An idiot? I can get angry! Hey, over here. Just show yourself! I'm your next door neighbor! Huh? - Next door? - Yes, next door! So, please keep it down. The walls are super thin. You're a human? Now that I'm not a ghost, you're talking down to me. You talked down to me first! Hey... Why are you doing this? The walls are too thin to be soundproof. What? Complaining to our landlords won't help. We live in different buildings, with different addresses. Our landlords need to agree to fix the walls, but they hate each other. I see... But why did I hear ghostly sounds? I couldn't take it anymore, so... How stupid are you? You were trying to make me leave? Hey, are you a psychopath? You're the one who's insane! Thin walls, no elevator and a terrible bathroom! How can you live there? The bathroom is spacious! Have you seen it? My realtor said that I could be as loud as I want here. We're talking through the walls. Are you sure you can handle it? Come closer. Why should I come closer? Most importantly... Most importantly? I was here first! Haven't you heard of 'finders keepers'? Finders keepers? I don't give a damn. Leave! You leave! All right? Hey. Let's not waste time and emotions. We should compromise. Like taking turns. What use would that be? I can hear you pee! You want to take turns peeing? What nonsense. I'll make you compromise. Rock and roll, baby! You can't even play the guitar! Why don't we compromise? You psychopath... That psychopath... We'll see how long you last. Si fa. Si fa, si fa. Are you sleeping, si fa? All alone, si fa? Dr. Jang! My dad's at a conference. Come get your supplements! I'll be right there. Don't glare at me like that! Be thankful your older sister does your errands. Mom wants to know when you're coming home. She loved it when I moved out. She wants me back? She just wants to see you. My panic attacks got worse. I could die on my way home. Crazy bitch! At least call her. I'm off. You... You're not getting worse, are you? Cold-hearted bitch. Let's see... Look how dark it is! Seung-jin, be the bigger man. Focus on what's in front of you. Should I fight her? Why does he have so many instruments? Oh, lord... What's that sound? How's that? She knows no limit. She's underestimating us. Hey! What's wrong with you? Don't do this! Hey, stop! Those sounds are too erotic! I'll apologize, so stop! Listen to him suffer. Wait right there! You'll regret this! Come if you dare. You don't scare me at all. I'll get her good! Where is she? Am I going the wrong way? Where are you? You're dead meat! Almost there... You're dead meat! Why is this alley so long? What's going on? What... We live in different buildings, with different addresses. Different addresses... She still lives next door. She lives next door! Let's take a look... My phone! Why am I so stupid? I ran around for nothing... I'm about to hyperventilate... I need to go back... He gives up easily. My phone, my phone... You... That's it? That won't be enough. Hey, stop it! You win! So, stop it! Let's compromise! Compromise, you say? Then, say 'please'. Go on. You bastard crossed a line. You're going to take turns? How? 4 hours each. Is that possible? He drives me insane. What's his voice like? Why do you care about her voice? Is she pretty? How would I know that just from his voice? Still, you must get a vibe from him. All I'm getting is the vibe of a crazy psychopath! Good luck. It's my time now It's my time now It's my time now Fine, it's your time. Just give me 2 minutes! No, 1 minute! Time over! Time over! - That was tasty. - Where else should we go? Let's go to Seung-jin's place. He's busy practicing. He'll fail anyway, so it won't make a difference. Go on, call him! Seung-jin feels lonely easily. Tell him we're bringing alcohol. You're going to open the bottle? Let's drink. Please leave a message... He's not answering. - No worries! - Let's just go! Come on! It's my time now. I know. Who is it? Who is it? It's me. Open up! We came to visit the prisoner Lee Seung-jin! Quiet down. Why are you making that face? Open up! What's going on? I'm sorry. Open up! Still, it's my time now. I'll let them stay until midnight. It's way too late for this. I know, I apologize. It won't happen again. Lee Seung-jin, your punishment is to drink! What were you watching? - Nothing! - You're lying. Let's go in. What is it? Go in? How could you let this happen? You need to... Look at me. Make them leave by midnight. All right, I'll drink fast. You're becoming an alcoholic. No, I'm not. Your cheeks are red, like you were slapped. Get inside! We should empty this bottle tonight. Of course! Seung-jin, drink this and pass your audition! Rock and roll! - Tomcat! - Tomcat! Rock and roll! Tomcat! Let's go! - Don't you want to go home? - No. Drink more. - Hey, hurry up. - I know. Jae-young, Jae-young! Wake up, man! Your wife and kids are waiting for you at home. - Drink all of it. - Right? They're visiting my in-laws. I'm free tonight. - Free! - Free! They're visiting his in-laws. What's the name of your audition show? He's super drunk. Look into my eyes. I told you, it's 'Dream Again'. Oh, Dream Again. Dream Again. Dream Again. Hey, pour your heart into it this time. If you think you'll fail, find a new path. You're talking too loud. It's getting late, so drink up. Jae-young, drink up. - I'm free. - I know. Free! - Just drink. - Free... - Free! - Drink up. My head hurts... I bet it does. Your friends must have steady jobs, unlike you. They woke up and left at six and seven o'clock. I see. They aren't bad people. Oh, I'm sure. Your other friend left just now. His name is Ji-woo. The fruit seller. Hey... Let's talk after I use the toilet. Hold on. A woman? No, she's a ghost. Let's pray. Please let Seung-jin pass his audition! Right. Please let me meet a beautiful girl. Me, too. Oh, I'm screwed. I think I swore at her. I think I remember. Do women like this? - Well... - Is it expensive? Those are imported shine muscat grapes. They must be expensive. Just tell her that you're really sorry. You need to practice at home. I told you to take them home by midnight! Why did you bring them? She's super sensitive and aggressive! I told you, she's a psychopath! What'll I do? Beg for forgiveness, then. Use these grapes to beg for forgiveness! Give me that. She won't be able to see it, so just get down on your knees. Don't ever get drunk and call me again. Look at me, I'll kill you. I'm being serious. What are you doing? Imported, you say? They're Korean grapes, you lying bastard! You have no shame. Hey... I'm really sorry about last night. I'm on my knees right now. You're lying. - Can you see me? - Can you? No. The thing is... I have an audition two days from now. So? So... For today and tomorrow, let's stick to the schedule. After that, you can use all of the time for two days. Fine, let's do that. Really? If you don't like it, never mind. No, not at all! I love it! Thank you so much! It's my time now. Be quiet. Talking to a wall feels like confessing in church. Do you know why I can't give up singing? I... Betrayed these idiots. I didn't mean to. I wanted to make it as a solo artist so that our band would be successful. But it didn't go so well. Hey... Please pray for me. I want to repay my debt by succeeding this time. Okay? Ghosts are like gods, after all. What's wrong? Did you get hurt? No, I'm fine. You don't sound fine. Don't you need the hospital? Just sing your stupid songs. I was just worried. Why do you react that way? I already told you, I'm fine. You're all by yourself. Tell me if you need anything. Why should I? Just... Tell me, okay? You should have worn a suit. Yo! Are you coming to the afterparty? There's an afterparty? They're leaving for their honeymoon next week. I want to go home. Why? Is it because of Hye-ji? - You broke up ages ago. - It isn't! Come on, college has been forever. Look at him. I won't drink much. I promise. He's begging so he can go to the afterparty. I'll prepare a great birthday gift for you. Even a married guy is coming. The lead vocalist of Tomcat should be there. - Tomcat! - Rock and roll! Let's go. Dr. Jang, come on! Stop that. He left, so stop it. He left? You two were going to take turns, but he left? You drove him out, didn't you? No, he'll be home soon. Don't say that he left. Say that he's out. I'm busy, so leave. You're so selfish. Huh? Why are there so many left? I've been feeling better. - Really? - Yeah, I feel good. Don't try anything. Just leave. Fine. Leave! Congrats on getting married! Everyone, cheers! - Cheers! - Cheers! If you get too drunk, you'll get kicked out again. The clock's ticking. One more beer, please! Yes, sir. Here you go. You're embarrassing us. - Drink up. - Time's running out. Thank you all for coming. It's nice to see your faces again. - Drink as much as you want! - Cheers! - Cheers! - Cheers! Long time no see, Seung-jin. How have you all been? It's nice to see everyone again. You still smoke? I quit, but... Listen. I'm getting married. You'll congratulate me, right? What? Yeah, of course. Congratulations, I mean it. Thanks. I'm glad I got to see you before my wedding. I'll head inside now. Okay, see you. It's your time, but you weren't home. I'll tidy up, so wait a second. All right. Take all the time you need. The sound Of Your breath Just the thought of you Are you practicing, or just drunk? What does it matter? It's my time now, so don't mind me. I agreed on the schedule for your audition. I'm working on my mental state. I'm healing. Were you broken up with? Yes, a long time ago. She's about to marry a rich guy. So, leave me alone tonight. What a loser. I know. I'm a loser. I'm 31, and I have no suit. I have no job. Aren't you a singer? If you don't consider yourself a singer, you can't sing from the heart. You need to be proud of what you do. I am proud. But... I'm getting more and more confused. With zero progress. No one has zero progress. Look at things carefully, with love. Whatever it may be. Objects, emotions... Then, you'll progress. Ew, that was so cheesy. I'm going to bed! The sound of your breath The sound of your voice I'm entering Your entire world Mr. Lee Seung-jin. We'll see you in the third round. I did it! Who is it? Mail delivery. - Ms. Hong Ra-ni? - Yes. Hello? - Are you there? - Why? I passed! I passed the second audition! Are you busy? No, go on. Oh, you're down here. That's why... I want to buy you dinner tonight. - You? - Yes. Why? What do you mean? You told me to look at things carefully, with love. That really worked! I'll buy you anything you want to eat. What do you want? Can't make up your mind? I'll give you options. Korean, Chinese, Western... Wait, I'm poor. Let's have gimbap and pork cutlets. How does that sound? Not bad, right? Quiet. You don't like it? How about sushi? I can't have dinner with you. Why not? Tonight's no good for me. Instead... Instead what? Where are you looking? - This part of the wall. - Okay. Then... Open the can! Cheers! Cheers! This is nice, too. Did you sleep well? I guess. Spend all of the time until the evening. I need to go fix something. Fix what? Bye. Everyone is here, so let's begin the mediation. First, I'll hear the plaintiff's side. Will the defendant's side step outside, please? This intellectual property should be owned 70-30. Why is that? Hong Ra-ni created this character while working at WC Design. So, it's the company's property. But she worked hard, so I'll give her 30 percent. That's not true. I did work there, but that was my personal project. President Dong Won-chang had no designs for a meeting, so he asked to show my personal work. I allowed the company to use the design, but I didn't sign a contract handing over the rights. It's not the company's property. How much ownership would you like? 50-50 seems appropriate. I worked for that company. And the profit is from company sales. I'll compromise. What do you think? - I'll settle. - I'll settle. Thank you, Ms. Attorney. Good job. You did well. Thanks. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Maybe we should have appealed. It wouldn't have been easy. I let her off easy. She's probably lying about having panic attacks, to gain sympathy. She always overreacts. What the... I followed the smell of trash. It led me to you. You're the one who overreacted by suing. - You little... - You stink! He's a scumbag. - My company compensates - What a phony! - designers, no matter what. - This is all a lie? Unbelievable, right? Innovative design is created by happy workers. I should have hit him, just once! Once isn't enough! We need to make him pay. Look at those snake-like eyes and greedy cheeks! My eyes are suffering! He's firing up my love of justice! This bastard... Hurry! Hey! That's it. One... Help me. Are you crazy? - Get over there. - All right. Hey! Sir, you shouldn't exercise that way! - What? - You'll sprain your back. Who are you? - Your back is important. - Move over. He's the best at this in Korea. Me? Show him. - All right. - Now, lift! Why are you shaking? He's trembling. That's because of his strength. What sport did you use to compete in? High jump. - High jump? - He used to be an athlete. - Try again. - Okay. That's it, good tension. - Hurry. - Watch your knees. A high jump athlete... Focus, or you'll sprain your back. Come on, more! - Okay, stop! - Okay! Wow... - You're a fast learner. - Not at all. Let's increase the weight. - 5kg more. - Isn't it enough? Let's add 5kg. That's it! You're doing great! That's how you digest food! Pull in your stomach! - Excellent! - Okay! - Keep going! - Thank you! Work for manly thighs! Wait... Hold on... Put down your phones. Put them down! It's coming out... Stop filming me! Stop! Who poops himself at a gym? Oh my god, have you seen 'Dung Won-chang'? What are you talking about? Look, this video is #1 right now. He wanted to become famous, and he got his wish. No one will ever forget this. Look! Whoa... Put down your phones. Put them down! It's amazing, right? Once isn't enough! We need to make him pay. Look at those snake-like eyes. It's amazing, right? Hey... - Are you home? - Yes, I am. Um... Did you have dinner? Not yet. Is that so? Then... Do you want to have a beer with me? Sure. Why isn't she outside, enjoying the weather? Talk to me. - I have a question. - Yeah? Dung Won-chang... That was you, right? I didn't want you to know. How did it feel? You went 'wow', right? You talk like a child. A child? How old are you? Why do you keep talking down to me? - Me? - Yeah. - I'm the same age as you. - What? I'm whatever age you are. Do you want to talk down to me? No. You're too scary to talk down to. Cheers! Let's see... You don't get that many calls. And you don't go out that often. Doesn't it get boring? You make my life less boring. Right? I'm even more fun in person. Should we... Meet in person? No. Let's meet after your audition's over. - With lighter hearts. - Okay. But after this audition, I might become a superstar. I'm serious! What if I ignore you after that happens? Huh? I'm feeling generous. You might feel nervous. I don't want that. You're my girlfriend now. You'll be my girlfriend, right? 'You're my girlfriend now.' What the hell! - A little more! - Is it here? A bit higher! Hold on... - Did you sleep well? - Yes. Is there something you need to do today? Well... Not really. Then... - Let's go on a date. - What? Date! How? Look... See the place on the right? This place is really trendy right now. All right, let's go there. Let's pretend we're at the cafe. Okay. Next, slice the garlic. Slice them how? Make thin slices. Oh, thin slices. Okay. You marinated the meat in pepper and olive oil, right? Let's cook it. After the meat's done, cook the veggies. Veggies? What's wrong? Are you hurt? No... Isn't the heat too high? You're supposed to cook meat on high heat. The Maillard reaction makes the meat more flavorful. Finished! What time is it? Looks great. Isn't it time yet? - I showed up... - Don't say anything weird. What? Here, fruit. Why did you bring these? Why are there only two chairs? Why are you in a suit? You said I looked good at the wedding. What's his name? We agreed not to ask. Don't you know anything about him? Excuse me. Say hello to my friend. Say hello. Hello. - Hello. - Hello. This feels strange. Hello. If you like each other, you'll want to hold hands. - And do more... - Stop! Right, nowadays people have sex before dating. Crazy bastard! Have you experienced it yourself, you moron? You have no one! I'm so sorry. I apologize. Do you think so, too? About having sex first? No, not at all! I like where we're at right now. Not many people date like this. Not seeing you makes things more exciting. I really like it. He likes it! You look pretty today. Why the sudden compliment? Ra-ni, you look much better than before. Good luck. If he breaks your heart, tell me right away. I'll come kill him. I'm off. Bye. Stop talking nonsense and just leave. Are you two going to do something together? Shut up and just leave. Hey, come here. Decide whether to go steady after seeing her face. Platonic love is bullshit. All right, just leave! And brush your teeth. Your breath stinks. Bye. I told you to leave! You bastards never answer your phones! Did you have dinner without me? Thanks for this. Goodbye. Huh? Hey... Do you know 'Cat Town'? What? I had all of the comic books in the series! Me, too. I had every single book. They're going to add my character? They're going to use your design for the new character? Not right away. I need to modify my design to fit their art style. It's still your design! Wow! I wish you could see this! I have goosebumps! I've been talking with a genius artist! Come on... That's awesome! Congratulations! Hold on. Who is it? Sorry to barge in. I know this is wrong... But you're the only person that came to my mind. I don't think I can get married. Could we talk? Wait. Calm down. Let's go talk outside. Now is not the time. I need to think. Dead... You hadn't changed at all. You were still trying to quit smoking. You were still innocent. And you were still going to auditions. Everyone had changed, except for you. I guess that's why I thought of you. I'm so jealous. You're still the same. You scared me! Why are you here? I missed you. You seem busy. Crazy bastard, I almost had a heart attack. Is it an emergency? There's no emergency. I just thought you might be bored. - Want some help? - No, you're busy. Go practice. I'll help you. I'm fine. Give it your all this time. Don't repeat your mistakes. You need to pass. All right. Go practice. - I'm off. - Okay. Thanks. - I'm off. - Bye. Hey! Hi, Dung Won-chang. You're crazy. I didn't come here to fight. How about it? You'll do it, right? It's a business to business contract. We'll split the profits. You're our contractor... You're not listening. I know that you hate me. But this is a big deal for us, and for you. Look at this. I brought this, just in case you forgot. It's the resume you handed in. Think of this time. Remember how hard you worked to make your dreams come true? You would even pull all-nighters. We used to have a common goal. Let's achieve it together. I'll work for my company. You work for your dream. Next up is my character design prototype. Everyone will love... This cat character that I've created. 'Kitz'. Hong Ra-ni, hey! You were home all day, right? Did something happen? My ex-lover didn't come to see me. Nothing as dramatic as that. Hey... I'm heading out. You should have come as soon as you got worse. You're ill. What's the use of overreacting? I'm not a child. Yes, that's right. Mr. Seung-jin... Are you feeling sick or uncomfortable? Not at all. I'm sorry. Let's wrap up the interview. Please film your daily life, like a vlog. Damn... Are you off work? I'm a busy lawyer. I'm working late. - Do you have dinner plans? - Not yet. Great. Come to my office. Let's have pork belly with soju. Sounds great. - I'll be right there. - Okay. See you then. - Seung-jin. - Yeah? Sit down. It won't take long now. Okay. You seem busy. Things are hectic these days. I'm jealous of you. Dong Won-chang? - Hey... - Yeah? Dong Won-chang. What a funny coincidence. He's Dung Won-chang, right? Yeah. I guess he's as selfish as he looks. Attorney Jang took on this case for the money. With this contract, they can steal her copyright. Is something like this legal? If she becomes a contractor, she's no longer the co-owner. She's just an outsider who works for him. The copyright of the changed character goes to him. He's fishy. Let's go. It's Ra-ni. Hong Ra-ni. Excuse me. Yes? Oh, you must be her sister. Ra-ni's sick. She's sleeping. How sick? Is she okay? She's having severe symptoms. Ra-ni always keeps problems to herself. She struggles by herself, and then falls ill. But... Her condition improved after meeting you. Sometimes, it's harder to open up to a family member. You two are always together. I'm sorry to ask you this favor... But please take care of her. All right. I will. I'll try. Does that hurt? Crazy bastard! Who are you? Crazy bastard? You're the bastard! You're a scumbag who uses people's dreams! What the fuck are you talking about? Who sent you? Never you mind. Scumbags like you hurt people who put love into their work! You bastard... Hong Ra-ni? What? Come here, I'll kill you. - I can do that, too. - You psychopath! - Come over here. - You crazy bastard. You son of a bitch! Hong Ra-ni... How dare you send a man to fight me? What? A pale, lanky guy is in love with you. Hey... You think I'm using you? Forget about the contract. Let's go lose-lose. Wait, it's not a loss for me. As he said, it's your dream. Not mine. Don't call me, unless it's to beg. It's time for your supplement. Thanks. Mr. President... This is a big deal for us. If it doesn't work out, we won't get investments. She won't give up. It's Hong Ra-ni's dream. Are you insane? What? You went to Dong Won-chang. That's right. You're too naive to know this. The opportunity to make your dreams come true is rare. Don't cross the line again. Wait, never mind. I... We've never seen each other, so let's call it quits. Why would you say something like that? If I forgive you... Something similar will happen again. You can't understand me. You've never poured your entire life into something. Hey... Calm down. Just listen. That guy... No, that bastard... He's trying to scam you. If you sign the contract, he can steal your character. You think panic attacks make me dumb? I know more about this opportunity than you do. I'm fine on my own, so mind your own business. Are you going to keep talking that way? Your dream is making you blind. You're the one who told me to look at things carefully, with love. You poured your entire life into that character. Right? Hey... I'm begging you. Please listen to me. If you care about that character, listen to me. You should see Mom before you leave. No. I'll wait until I'm less busy. Don't tell her I was here. Oh... Thanks for the porridge. It was good. - I'll get going. - Bye. Um, hello. I'll show you what's happening. The third audition... Are you home? I'll accept your offer. Under one condition. Don't interfere while I create my design sample. These are important times for me. The same goes for you. So... Let's go back to taking turns. I'm preparing for the third... The third audition... Excuse me. Yes? For me, this is too uncomfortable. I'll stay somewhere else until my audition's over. You look like a beggar, not a singer! Get up. You smell! What smell? I don't smell! I have a headache! Aren't you going to explain what happened? I'll deal with it myself. Your smell will make the fruit rot! You don't even have customers. You're talking nonsense. You're not a child! Go shave! Your hairs will get all over the fruit! Come on! Shave right now. Don't tell me what to do! I shouldn't have come here. Take this call. I was about to! Why don't you go lose some weight? Hello? Mr. Lee Seung-jin, this is Jang Min-kyung. Hello, Ms. Producer. You've been avoiding my calls. Sorry about that. Mr. Seung-jin, we don't need your vlog. Please return the camera today. Of course. I'll send you the address. All right. Are you out? No. The camera... Are you home? I'm Ku Ji-woo. We had dinner together. Oh, right. Hello. How've you been? My friend asked me a favor. I'll be as quiet as I can. Take your time. All right. I found it! I'll get going now. Goodbye. Wait... Yes? Is he all right? Hey... This is so unfair. I sent you to one place, but you sent me to two. How is that fair? Friends shouldn't talk about fairness. Are you going to pay to sleep here? That's too much! I had to deliver to the top floor. These lyrics are great. - Really? - Yeah. Why are you grinning? Did you check the camera? The camera? All I filmed were bloopers. So, I had it delivered. Crazy bastard. What if they show the bloopers on TV? What's wrong with you? Why are you angry? I'm not angry! Was there something on the camera? It's not that. I'm just worried about your image. You should have checked it. I have no public image. Plus, I didn't film much. So, don't worry. It's hot today. - Do you have a cold beverage? - You can have a beer. Sounds great! Wow, it's finally finished. My sister's so talented. Do you want me to come with you? No, I'll be fine. I need to see this through myself. - Sis... - Ew! - We never hug. - Stop it! Mr. Seung-jin. Mr. Seung-jin. Can I see you for a moment? I thought you filmed this part by accident. But there's some audio. You should give it a listen. All right. No.92, Mr. Lee Seung-jin. Please get up on stage. You're here. That must have been heavy. Should I have sent a car? - Seung-jin! - Go for it! Hello. I'm contestant No.92, Lee Seung-jin. Thanks for having me. Fighting! Let's see your design sample. You still value products over people. You'll never change. How scary. Business partners shouldn't treat each other that way. Have some coffee. No. I don't want to stay here long. I like that about you. You don't like me, but you're still a professional. That's admirable. You'll regret this. Wait... Regret? I'll lead a good life without you. You still stink. Why, you... I had no idea How hurt you were My situation isn't that great, either All I can film is the wall. It's recording. Start talking. I'm sure you're disappointed in me. I shouldn't have spoken that way. I'm sorry. I should have looked carefully at things that aren't visible to the eye, as well. Let's go together It's been a long time since I forged a deep relationship with someone. That's why I forgot... How happy it can feel. I'm going to move forward, thanks to you. You poured your heart into your song. It was really good. Now, I know that's enough. Even if your dreams don't come true... Pouring your heart into something is enough. I don't know if I'll make it in time... But let's resolve everything. And... Meet in person. I love you with all my heart I love you with all my heart I love you with all my heart Thank you. - That was great! - You did well! - Good job! - Tomcat! No.92, your name is Lee Seung-jin? I'm sorry to say this... But your singing was awful. However, you really moved my heart. Your singing wasn't that good, but we could feel your love. In just a few weeks... Now, I know that's enough. Even if your dreams don't come true... Pouring your heart into something is enough. Excuse me... Thank you. He's just leaving? - Seung-jin! - Lee Seung-jin! Hey! Let's do this! Is this really necessary?
