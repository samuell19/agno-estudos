did you stop painting I was bored that's all you were unhappy you were very unhappy when I met you I will speak my mind over this business race leave it to me mother and closer engaging Martin Jordan to liberate money from the family trust which is what it amounts to is simply outrageous it's only a part of what he'll do it'll be disastrous for closer and it's unfair to our brother and sister nonsense she ought to have financial independence now not after we done he has it up to a point it's a work for the rest hmm really I despair she always gets what she wants and you'll seem powerless
