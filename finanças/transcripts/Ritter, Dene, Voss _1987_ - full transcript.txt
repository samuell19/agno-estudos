Bath too hot it's always the same with him BEFORE LUNCH difficulties of interpretation apathy catafalquism he accuses us of Did you tell him that Doctor Frege is the only possible one No I have to proceed carefully Proceed gently Fraulein Worringer the director said The follow-up physician Doctor Frege Between Steinhof and here he hardly said a word hardly a word Not even about Schopenhauer No And his Germanophobia Not a word about the Germans And his sore throat Better he's not coughing any more Not a word about Frege I don't feel like kicking the bucket to save my brother that's what I told the director It's an instinct for self-preservation to take my brother home is what I said I can't come to Steinhof every day after all I'm not well myself He looked at me uncomprehendingly Do what you think is right he said but don't forget that your brother is extremely vulnerable extremely vulnerable Pointless to think about the inadmissible While you only visited him once a week I went to Steinhof every day Day in day out Destruction self-destruction philosophical that's what he said threw his salami sandwich into the toilet bowl in front of my very eyes Schopenhauer and washing his hands Talked again about his log cabin in Sognefjord going on about Norway in his room all the time I didn't know how to get him off the subject and only the day before the word Germanophobia all the time The Norwegian quirk Paid three million in two years because we have no medical insurance Catafalquism You ought to have left him in peace have left him in Steinhof But it's only a trial Which always ends in disaster Tell me where are the sugar cubes? In the left-hand drawer Got himself completely snowed in at Sils Maria Burned all his Christmas presents scornful laughter shortage of breath afraid he was dying Once again afraid of cancer of the tongue Cancer of the tongue is not hereditary Yes it is How long has father been dead Twenty years He had the most beautiful death that I can imagine without the slightest pain he went to sleep like a child Only two days before we had been to the opera Turandot Henry James conceived us not our parents that's what he said Smothered in luxury always just barely got away You or I to this very day that will never change I let him finish talking Treatise on Logic Part One Treatise on Logic Part Two finally transcribed I said all along the avenue and back again without contradicting I said he should sit in the back seat he didn't object at all got in all by himself the pills worked immediately He wanted to go along Hill Road we stopped at the Fischer House he asked to get out we got out we took a short walk he seemed quite calm he looked down at the city wanted to know where our house was he couldn't find it at once that annoyed him There it is I said that made him doubly annoyed that I had found it before he had I hadn't changed he said And neither had you sisters are the problem he said thanked me for my transcribing then I saw that he had no socks on shoes on his bare feet thanked me a second time for my typing it was us father had loved he said for him he only had hatred suddenly he recited his favourite sentence the Schopenhauer sentence quite calmly without the least agitation I'd arranged I said for us to be alone when he got home just us siblings no servants no maid We really only need the small kitchen nobody but ourselves To take a bath by myself he said without being stared at by a keeper He wanted to go for a stroll we walked a little way into the woods I said I had been to the cemetery the family grave was neglected the birch tree had split the slab on the tomb he was fascinated that I should describe the grave to him and how I did it We simply have to take our chances One day you'll walk in the park with him I'll do it the next day I was against it I'm still against it I would never have taken him out at least not right now Now or never I thought Now he's agreed You're totally absorbed in Ludwig organised your whole life around him With his consent do bear that in mind he wanted to come home now I wouldn't have brought him home not now of all times Now you're back on stage playing that blind woman you know it's ridiculous Precisely because I'm returning to the stage Self-realisation what a disgusting word this odious word crops up everywhere self-realisation there's nothing more repellent there's nothing more stupid it doesn't mean anything the word self-realisation but they all parrot it doesn't matter who you are you are after all realised you are yourself there isn't a more absurd word or a more repellent one than self-realization and everyone uses it continuously The phrase function of truth is another example I hate those words all those terms He said we were intelligent siblings Perhaps you'll go with him to Doctor Frege's tomorrow afternoon He only says what he's thought out There always has to be fresh milk in the house that's important I'll walk with him in the park every day I said to the director and I will be punctilious about his pills Be careful not to leave him on his own when he cuts his toenails the director said always hang his coats up so that the lining can't be seen You must take your time with him When he expounds his logic to you you must listen to him you must keep quiet no comments you understand no contradiction as if we didn't know him better than that and don't say that you haven't understood just as you mustn't say that you have understood What a repellent person that director is polish his glasses without his knowing he said and be sure to do it every day because he doesn't polish them and thinks he's bound to go blind he's afraid of blindness and of cancer of the tongue I can reassure you cancer of the tongue is not hereditary For gentlemen like your brother he said coarse cotton underwear is the right choice don't ever give him silk underwear believe me common coarse cotton underwear is best for him That loud repellent director's voice I hated it from the beginning but we have to put up with these people give useful hints of course no matter how loathsome these people are You would be well advised to rub your brother down at least once a week with a Turkish towel for six or seven minutes and play part of the Eroica while you're doing it Beethoven means something very special to your brother as you know and do you know what else he said quite expressly don't ever give your brother the impression that you are watching him but don't ever let him out of your sight It's not a bad idea to have guests now and then invite some people I should think parties are good for him To stay in London and suffocate in London for years he threatened us with that I saved myself I said to myself it's my life not his and what if he had suffocated in London or in Cambridge or in Norway in his log cabin You went to bring him back not me The continent will be the death of me that's what he wrote so often on his postcards A person who does not write manuscripts but only superscriptions lifelong logic Nothing but blackmail that's what he's always used against us I saved myself you became his slave To stay in London and to suffocate in London and then the Norwegian blackmail the so-called log cabin designed against himself Summer clothing fetishism that's what he accused me of spoiled my dancing lessons when I read Goethe he boxed my ears he spied on me in town called me a liar every chance he got You've always hated him That's always been your calumny You've resented his every phrase You've always hated his way of thinking no matter what he did you hated it His hatred of children has always scared me I wonder if he deliberately didn't wear socks or whether he forgot to put them on do you know what else the director said I know you hate it when your brother uses suspenders please let him keep his suspenders The doctors always think of everything The whole time he said Well-Tempered Clavier while I was signing the release I wonder whether Doctor Frege is the right doctor but he's the only one we have To stay in London and suffocate in London On Sunday he wants to go to the Musikverein to the philharmonic concert do you know what they are playing Beethoven probably and Schoenberg and Webern are you coming along No I hate those concerts for years it's been the same pieces the same conductors the same people But with Ludwig it will be quite different The director says these concerts are indispensable therapeutic matinees so to speak we can't let him go by himself Why don't you come once at least You haven't been to the Musikverein in such a long time We'll sit in Row Eight our subscription seats I'm bored by those matinees But that is music that can be heard over and over again Not by me it isn't it has all been heard ultimately it's all been heard and all been seen That's your megalomania Leave me in peace I'm setting the table and you sit reading the paper as though it's not your business Now you have your philosopher brother in the house and need to cope with him somehow He's your brother as well Yes but I didn't take him out of Steinhof But we had both discussed everything together But you decided to take him out of Steinhof at your own risk But don't you want him home as well he's your brother too Yes If we are here together for him after all it's not the first time we've tried There was nothing he wanted more than to go to the Musikverein on Sunday Beethoven Brahms that Schoenberg always the same that boring Webern What there's too much of in Beethoven there's too little of in Webern I beg you spare me the philharmonic concerts why don't you two take Doctor Frege with you While I was drawing a bath for him he twice said cryogenics philosophical he wanted to make a note of it so I ran to fetch his notepad but when I got back he screamed at me that he had never said cryogenics philosophical and had not asked for his notepad either he insisted that I stay in the bathroom until he was completely naked I was to tell him that he was ugly you're not ugly you're beautiful I said and it wasn't a lie of course of course he really is beautiful The keepers always enjoy looking at me the doctors too he said bunch of perverts they enjoy beating me too and I enjoy being beaten by them and my fellow patients he said enjoy looking at me too and they enjoy beating me But I never beat them I never hit back he said Naked Ludwig is a welcome sight he said and immersed himself in the tub I finally had to say three times that he was ugly after he had stood up quite straight in front of me and I had to say it with a straight face and I did say it with a straight face and it really wasn't a laughing matter Why three times I don't know three times I had to say you are ugly I said it although I didn't want to and while I did he touched What Oh you always bring me to the point where I admit everything Pervert And you Your brother's prick driving you almost to distraction isn't that it You provoke him into acting like that you are both bogged down in your infantilism but that's your problem and his problem A postcard posted in the year twenty-one that's to say three years after the end of World War I posted in Linz arrived in Vienna yesterday It's the bath water you run the bath water very hot and that drives him crazy and you take advantage of him that's what it is you do it on purpose Gas explosion in the Third District two housewives dead mutilated beyond recognition Our breakfasts haven't changed in twenty years not in thirty years the same thing on the same bread for thirty years and drinking the same tea with it don't you think we should do away with ourselves for this reason alone Two actresses from the Josefstadt Theatre doing away with themselves wouldn't that be a headline Played the viola you did that too I played the piano you the viola because Uncle Friedrich played the viola Had to I heated it up Of course what else Heated it up yourself at any rate For twenty years you've been transcribing his manuscripts I'm convinced that one day they will even be printed they'll be published by a major house Logic I Logic II with the assistance of my sister etcetera Without you after all there would be no manuscript by him he thinks it out and you type it put it in order even the spelling you transcribe it without you there wouldn't be a Ludwig any more nothing of his that's to your credit one day he calls it art then again philosophy or he calls it nonsense and when he dictates to you he despises you but you're happy enough to type it you are completely absorbed in his dictation Our brother is a genius not a fool one day they'll be working on him at all the universities in America everywhere even though he calls everything he's written nonsense not senseless nonsense The Steinhof sojourns are his summer vacations instead of going to Sils Maria with us he goes to Steinhof instead of going to Lucerne with us he goes to Steinhof Not even a Christmas with us our holiday hater sings in the choir at Steinhof on Christmas Eve in his institutional clothes father told him he wouldn't be any good even in the acting business that was the most scathing indictment When people ask about his relatives he says my sisters are actresses at the Josefstadt not without talent my father died of cancer of the tongue The acting business that's all that was left for us nothing more I never wanted a profession and you I don't know You had stage presence Yes perhaps In comedies and tragedies Just because our uncle was a theatre manager The daughters of Worringer the industrial tycoon fled to their theatre manager uncle out of boredom had had enough of life ended up in the Josefstadt Theatre If you say so He always called you the gifted one the one for whom there was hope I was always the untalented one for whom there was no hope Because he loved us our uncle Genteel daughters of genteel ladies in insipid plays with background music And because our brother hated it we joined the theatre that was a decisive factor because our brother hated the theatre and because our parents hated the theatre hatred of the theatre was the greatest in our family Perhaps And Ludwig took the philosophical route suicidal a lone-wolf suicidal Logic I Logic II written alternately in London and Norway typed up by his sister his eccentric magnum opus by his older sister of course The precision instrument as he calls you that's what you've been for twenty years If you play the piano you cannot type that was my good fortune but typing and playing the viola that's all right It's always your unhappiness which speaks out And in your case it's just your happiness I want to set the table for him just as he loves it just as mother used to set it just as father loved it Geometrimania even on the dining table exercises in submissiveness After all it's only a try The eighteenth or the nineteenth Anna cooking would be better of course but we would have had to put up with her this way we're alone undisturbed just the three of us the first time for a long while The first evening is the most difficult of all No candles he hates candles on the table hatred of illumination He always liked clear soups With his shoes on his bare feet and reciting the Schopenhauer sentence and three times you had to say that he was ugly Again and again the word antipathy while walking back to the car with him Ludwig is a fanatic about cleanliness pathological naturally like our father but father didn't carry it to such extremes and father didn't end up in Steinhof Worringer the industrial tycoon who used to wash his hands thirty times a day and nobody knew about it except us Transcribed the so-called dualism chapter last night not a wink only wondering how shall I bring him home on the phone with the director twice And don't forget two tablets thrice a day not three twice already enough to drive me crazy the way the director continually said intelligent man Your philosopher brother is over the worst he said but remember that he'll be vulnerable all his life In Zurich it was nice do you remember free and easy He only dictates what he's thought out Our anti-Kant It answers a need in him to dictate to me it's all therapeutic the director said That's the death penalty I pronounce on you said Ludwig my dictating to you or at least and in any case a life sentence even worse always on the brink of insanity never going over the brink but always on the brink of insanity if we leave that border region we are dead Going to Rome now you don't need me you are the really important person in his life not me I'm just a burden I'm the one who makes him nervous I can't even cook I can't even heat things up Everything still the way our parents furnished it nothing's been changed since our parents died I would have cleared everything out everything but you objected now you're almost suffocating here But you could have gone away to Rome for example or to Amsterdam I wouldn't have put any obstacles in your path but then you'd forfeit your contract Didn't go away that's it but not for Ludwig's sake like you because I couldn't because you've always paralysed me kept me chained up and not because of the Josefstadt either I kept you chained You are completely independent you've always been free to do what you liked but you didn't want to go away You blame me you've always blamed me for chaining you to this house but you could have gone at any time wherever you liked True I often said go you didn't go I was never interested in men but you were and yet you stayed Not for Ludwig's sake Ludwig Ludwig I'm here for Ludwig but not you you stayed because you didn't want to take risks because of the Josefstadt that's the truth Your truth My truth Ludwig means everything to me you said Now he's back in your gilded cage And you My favourite brother my favourite philosopher you said My favourite brother my favourite philosopher Your anti-Kant You've never done more than put up with Ludwig never really looked after him but then you are the younger sister Why are you always talking about Rome and Paris and you don't go I've only ever known you to lie in bed eating what Anna has cooked reading the paper and forever disappointed in love After mother's death you started talking the way she talked to this day adopted her way of walking you even tug at your hair like mother and you have the same way of saying supper and you sit there and say nothing just like mother and you say Ludwig like her every time you say Ludwig I hear mother saying Ludwig To Rome next week or to Normandy or the Shakespeare at the Josefstadt after all as long as it gets me out of here And in a just a few days you'll be back that's your misfortune you know You're quite right there you're my clairvoyant You have always directed everything to your misfortune Your brother is right you attract your misfortune Some attract it some repel it I always felt you two were going behind my back In our elementary school you were five years ahead of me my whole life but we have unhappiness both of us you have yours I have mine you cook when you have no alternative I read the papers newspaper addiction for which you blame me I never blame you for anything myself yes but not you To Budapest with Ludwig without saying a word I didn't blame you to The Magic Flute with Ludwig all behind my back no blame from me I always swallowed it all as they say I was always watching everything you've straightened everything out I don't know who suffered more Disease is a sacred process religion he said you think I don't see what you are to him We shall never find a way out of our errors Bought five shirts the most expensive took them to Steinhof and he didn't wear a single one gave them all away after all it's my money too our money Refractoriness he explained it to me the last time I visited him snow falling outside the window he said then he was going blind rapidly complained as usual that there were bugs that the door to the terrace was stuck that the windows wouldn't close I'll phone that Doctor Frege Seven hundred schillings for ten minutes there's doctors for you we ask them to suggest a way to help but they make no suggestions they don't help But Doctor Frege has known him longest an experienced doctor as far as Ludwig is concerned He looks for sympathy but he offends everybody he antagonises everybody Indifference to philosophy on your part he got back to that again the stupid sister that's what you are I'm the officious one witless both of us He needs me I'm the one he depends on not on you but you're the one he loves Me it's you he loves you the useful one I'm the useless one whom he hates You're the one he's always favoured first favoured then loved you are the one closest to him Cutlery china everything has to be perfect he sees everything and we're afraid he might see something that he shouldn't Even as a child a horror of dirty cutlery Always a fresh napkin and most demanding when it came to food A fresh shirt three times a day Fresh bed linen every other day Our parents invested everything in him he was their child what were we We were conceived by Henry James we were not their children That's what father always said in his need to inflict pain and Ludwig says it too father thought just the way Ludwig does One was the industrial tycoon the other the philosophical tycoon Oh nonsense Ludwig is so infirm and so frail That's what you think that's how you see him because that's how you want to see Ludwig that's how you have to see him these people appear so infirm but they're stronger than anyone But I know but I can see how helpless he is He has you in his power totally Ludwig is a brute that's the truth and you know it too a thug with philosophical intentions but you can't admit that to yourself that would screw up your whole concept Never before have so many Italians come to Vienna inundating the city Everything Austrian fascinates the Italians Austrian history Austrian art everything Austrian If not for Ludwig we wouldn't be here at all we wouldn't be here any longer everything would have been sold you perhaps would be in Rome who knows where I would be Ludwig holds us together He ruined us long ago he annihilated us But you don't even believe that yourself you won't tell him to his face and anyway it's a lie Insofar as truth is also just a lie everything is a lie according to Ludwig a lie and a falsehood Ludwig is your property and vice versa Ludwig owns you and I am condemned to keep looking at this depravity Oh how everything gets on my nerves in this place You really are the most ruthless person unscrupulously ruthless But Rome would be just as unbearable Because we've already seen everything Where does our brother get the right to possess us The Josefstadt is my salvation I will act again it doesn't matter what I play Whatever you can do I can do too Turn one's back on the theatre that was just insincere posturing for the sake of a philosophical thug We must be on our guard against him he's intent on ruining us completely for years for decades he's worked his destruction We are the ones who need help not him we are the victims not him it's ourselves we must help not him Our mental cripple is destroying us has almost succeeded in destroying us that's his triumph his doing You're getting worked up when sober reflection alone is appropriate you've plunged headlong into your Ludwig complex he said that didn't he not you Even if he did say it you do have a Ludwig complex If only you could finally realise that this cul-de-sac is the only possible existence for us but you're not ready to do that you are still too young To have swallowed the logician's bait that's what's so repellent A soothing atmosphere secure and warm that's what our father always said Ludwig has often repeated that phrase mocking father that phrase has become so absurd with the passage of time By and by this house has become a hell for us The Worringer hell that's how Ludwig himself has often referred to it But really can't you see we have in fact turned this house into a Worringer hell and not even innocently we have consciously made this house into this Worringer hell you just won't admit who is the devil in that hell After the soup a slice of melon I don't think that's wrong I don't think that's wrong perhaps you should refrain from drinking wine if he sees that you're drinking wine All right I'll restrain myself but just this once just this one first time It would be better if Anna were here you'll spend the whole time running between kitchen and dining room he's always hated that housewives running from dining room to kitchen maddening You've never liked me even as a very small child you hated me He likes clear soup he hates so-called thick soup At first our parents spoon-fed him then we did it's sickening the way you constantly spoon-feed him It was always said that he was our little weakling until he turned into that monster the little helpless child turned into that megalomaniac that philosopher Beware of the weak our father always used to say for they are in fact the strong the weak rule us not the strong the so-called rules us not the actual the real the factual We are constantly shying away from everything he doesn't shy away from anything he only cares about thinking but who's to say that his thinking amounts to anything perhaps what he thinks is all mere nonsense perhaps he's always thought nonsense since he really is mad after all since in fact he calls Steinhof his real home My Ludwig you say and you think my Ludwig my philosopher when in reality he is only your fool your favourite fool the brother as the favourite fool as the favourite perversity There's nothing to say to that That's your strong suit what you have in common with Ludwig to say nothing when everything should be said not to respond when everything is asked You two will soon smother me completely with your hypocrisy You stir the soup thinking about how best to torture me while our brother amuses himself at our stupidity he philosophises in order to destroy me you stir the soup for the same reason For thirty years the same argument Just the way our father used to argue with our uncle but then it wasn't about Ludwig but about the factory it was just as odious I imagined this evening would be so beautiful After months for the first time to be dining again together with Ludwig just the three of us undisturbed Sibling affection a threesome You have always planned everything in your head and tried with all your power to put plans into action without regard for others You took Ludwig out of the institution you sent Anna away you decided who sat where at this table it's always you that's done everything And Ludwig doesn't even know that he owes everything he is to you You decided to take up the typewriter I the piano as a second artistic activity Developed a taste for it that's it You transcribe what he has thought out At the very height of craziness you type out what he has thought and I play the piano while you do it improvising philosophically so to speak at the piano I took four pairs of shoes to Steinhof in two weeks and he gave them all away Humanitarian megalomania You're against anything and everything that's your misfortune But our brother is our genius domiciled to be sure in Steinhof but matter for discussion at English universities achieved the status of a topic for dissertations in philosophy Refuge in the theatre didn't do us any good playacting nothing more Utensils that's what he calls us you who protect him screen him so to speak a utensil and he abuses us you who type up his thinking who reproduce him so sedulously sacrifices her nights for his thoughts Bought five shirts for him and then I meet all those people wearing them The director had Ludwig's hat on while he was talking to me your brother you know presented me with his hat then I had to put it on a bet you know I bet your brother that I would keep his hat on my head while you were in my office I cannot tell you what the stakes were but as you can see I am in the process of winning the bet Don't think madam said the director that I am crazy of course everyone says all directors of madhouses are crazy directors are crazier than the patients entrusted to their care people say that because it's what they like to hear No no a bet nothing more Furthermore the director said your brother has completed the Kierkegaard chapter which he'd been working on for eight months Steinhof the philosopher's retreat he said several times Steinhof the philosopher's retreat Your brother will be very famous one day and then people will say here in Steinhof is where his work was born and we hope that then they will also say that here in Steinhof he completed it That odious voice you know it very well My hand shook as I signed It's your responsibility of course the director said Suddenly Ludwig was there and said you've won the bet director Ludwig took the hat off the director's head and put it on This hat is much too small for me said Ludwig took the hat off again and put it back on the director's head You've won the bet my respects to you Ludwig said then he wrote out a cheque and put that cheque in the director's coat pocket And then what happened Nothing I said come along Ludwig let's go let's leave this place quickly The director accompanied me out of the door Ludwig had gone on ahead And then people were standing around everywhere because it was visiting hours you know and he blew kisses to them then he put his hand in his coat pocket to fetch a bundle of hundred schilling bills and started waving it about suddenly distributing the whole bundle bill by bill among the people Patients and visitors fighting over the hundred schilling bills And you did nothing to stop him No I wanted to take him out of the institution without a struggle he was quite calm now and again someone would call to him by his first name Ludwig and time and again he would blow kisses to them all Dualism that's what it is he exclaimed several times catafalquism militarism he got wrapped up in these words then suddenly he embraced me and said how happy I am that you are here You went to fetch him not me he can't accuse me of fetching him away Wasn't that what you were after in wanting me to come along with you to fetch him a sort of complicity when he realises it was a mistake to take him out at this juncture Complicity that's what you wanted that's why you suggested this morning that I should come with you to fetch him no no I didn't fetch him you fetched him Why do you always assume only the worst Whatever I do has in your eyes an ulterior motive your life is one long need to be suspicious You do nothing without a reason The older one is always responsible that's it you've used that against me for ever No no Ludwig got into the car quite calmly the director was still bowing when we were already more than a hundred metres away Was he sure he had packed everything and taken everything with him I asked Ludwig by then we were already driving along Hill Road yes he said everything What sort of part is the blind woman a big part Only one short appearance two sentences that's all And you subject yourself to that After all I haven't acted for four years but this interests me fascinates me and besides it won't wear me out completely Two sentences spoken by a blind woman I'm not worried about playing a big part I could have if I'd wanted to no no two sentences but how You were always ambitious on the stage you never took chances Every chance my dear every chance Yes every chance The many walk-on parts I've played when I could have played the very biggest It's not a question of how long an actor is on the stage it's merely a question of how two or three minutes of brilliant theatre Of course of course Our views were always not only different always opposed You always only wanted to play big parts I never did The difference is that because of Ludwig I didn't act for four years not like you because I didn't get a big part I could have played a big part at any time Ludwig made it impossible In any event a sacrifice to Ludwig As you see it Your talent is the greater of the two your talent is the opposite of mine You're a born histrionic I don't mean that in a pejorative sense on the contrary you're an actress through and through I have to give my all every time everything comes easily to you because to the genius everything comes easily The genius An actor is never a genius interpreters are not geniuses least of all actors And nothing I've ever done has come easily that's where you're wrong I know that I can be good for only three minutes and so I only appear for three minutes I was never ambitious to do a whole play a so-called big part But you also played big parts well even the ones where you're on all the time it didn't matter what it was always good no one could have acted those parts like you no question of that Whatever is going on inside my sister I wonder to make her so unhappy she has everything everything a person can have and is unhappy I'm not really an actress at all I just wanted to be among people that was the reason possibly I did have a modest talent for it an urge to play-act probably you've always had that too but not professionally anything professional has always put me off only because I didn't want to isolate myself that's the truth just to be allowed to attend rehearsals when I was in acting school was my salvation you know not actual interest in the art of acting No certainly not To be together with people of our own age And of course the fact that our uncle had shares in the Josefstadt and was also manager of the theatre played a part without him I would not have taken up acting later on They need a girl in the Shakespeare you're it my child that was all the rest is history You're quite a different case a real actress quite consciously with the highest aspirations You are much better than I am you know but in the end fortune was always on my side that's what it is nothing else specious good fortune Our rivalry in the theatre I never took it seriously when you acted well I was always pleased It's time he'll come Ludwig LUNCH Walking tall do you know what that means all the time till now I couldn't suddenly walking tall again According to regulations She brought me the wrong paper and made it impossible for me to write down chapter six everything lost finished I had told her the paper on which I wrote Logic I but she wasn't listening Flying the kite in Glossop do you remember the time in England a nice time Then he went to England and studied mathematics said the director Of course I heard everything that he said it isn't the Norwegian problem it's the Cambridge problem said the director Time and again from a wealthy family he said and volunteered for the army Then mathematics got the upper hand for what is philosophy if not mathematics mathematics on the brink Once I drew him the propeller blade that I had constructed on a piece of official stationery he was astonished I don't want a single room I said please not a single room and then wouldn't you know a single room a single room if you please It isn't the log cabin problem he said it's the Cambridge problem The rich simply have the most difficulties of any he said that Our sister confided to him that at eighteen I slept with our mother She said it without any trace of embarrassment that amused the director I would not have said that tattle-tale He first experimented with kites and balloons and then he turned to propulsion motors she said she thought that I was in my room all the time I was in the director's office waiting for her she had no way of knowing She and the director were discussing a trip to Madrid she wants to take on her own If you had paid attention to what I was saying everything would not now be lost to me I said to her you have destroyed everything of mine I can't make any notes on this paper Irritation ensued she left me at once I saw how she hated me she hated everything as she went away she even persecuted my fellow sufferers with her hatred I did not read the newspapers which she had brought along for me I distributed them I should not have done that they all started dancing beside themselves with the fun of the papers She thinks she types without making any mistakes she makes nothing but mistakes and yet there is nothing easier than typing from a neat manuscript She says she's returning to the stage she's going to act again Yes A comedy isn't it Sisters actresses theatre birds stage twitter My idea was to go further than all the others beyond all the others We are chained to oddities Do you understand me to oddities and suffocate in monotony Do you remember Glossop Yes of course How little has happened to us since then For heaven's sake Ludwig says that you brought him the wrong paper and that made him lose a lot of time How long has it been since Glossop Twenty-two years I know exactly my greatest disappointment Speak for yourself I was happy in Glossop I read a biography of Mozart I was in bed the whole time with a sore throat while you and Ludwig were experimenting with the kite My kite experiment my definitive discovery But I discovered something quite different from what I thought I had Years later I knew that in Glossop I had discovered something quite different I had a decisive share in that discovery Of course I was terribly ill You didn't want to go to Glossop you got ill in Glossop because you didn't want to go a fever on the very first day Glossop had a decisive influence on me Yes you regenerated yourselves in Glossop But I love biographies of artists that was my advantage My sore throat was only half as bad with Mozart there She's playing a blind woman short role on stage for two perhaps three minutes perhaps she'll taste blood I'm sure it will do her good A good thing we never completely broke our connections with theatre people I've always cultivated contacts with theatre people but I'm not ready to take just any part but even if we don't perform we must keep in shape I work at my art every day you understand Two artists for sisters I don't know has that brought me good luck or bad more bad luck than good certainly more bad luck My Ludwig the way he thinks our egoist Wouldn't you like another slice of melon She brought me five shirts and I gave them all away of course that annoyed her but it's my money after all The philosopher gives his thoughts away it is his thinking after all In Skjolden I thought I can't go on The director said that was my Norwegian problem the log cabin idyll In the evening before going to bed we have inspection and the doctor insists that we answer our names He says good night then we say good night the light is put out automatically Put out automatically Not bad food in the institution Everyone may eat as much as he wants the problem is I have no one to converse with in the night they all sleep soundly The nights in Steinhof are absolutely quiet Now you're at home and you can do what you want Now everything connected with Steinhof is over forget it would you like to hear some music No I've bought a new Ninth Yes Walking tall do you know what that means The afternoon walk will do you good or whatever you like Perhaps you want to read make some music perhaps or we'll invite company What company Company people Who would you like to see Perhaps it's better if we don't invite people right away perhaps it's best if you simply sleep as long as you want Rest rest rest rest Or do you want to dictate to me in the afternoon I spent the whole night with you with the chapter on dualism to be quite honest I don't understand any of it Is the front gate locked Of course There's a draft be sure to close the kitchen door there is a draft isn't there I'm so susceptible to drafts She's the one who's sick not you she's one who's sick It's good that you're here we were suffocating each other Our sister suffers from paranoia between you and me she tyrannises Anna daft about cleanliness not a moment's peace paces up and down in her room rushes into mine and asks whether I have an earache too I ask her why I should have an earache she says because I have an earache a terrible earache I can't sleep all night because she's running up and down in her room When I go into her room she'll be sitting in front of her jewel box shoves her bed with her own hands first into one corner then the other Two water-diviners were there they kept putting your bed into a different place now it's back in the place where it always was she thinks she's alone brushes your clothes for hours on end while I'm there all the time watching her she opens all the drawers in your room takes everything out wipes down all the drawers when I went into her room last week she had your dress trousers on frightened to death she said she didn't know what had made her put on your dress trousers Meat She sits at the window naked and spoons up her yoghurt as she listens to the Schumann piano concerto I don't want any more meat I don't know what she'll do in Madrid she's never said anything relating to Madrid She has a cactus in her room a thirty-year-old cactus Please close the door Ludwig looks well like he's just back from vacation He does He doesn't look a bit like a philosopher But what does a philosopher look like Like you since you are a philosopher Philosopher philosopher anti-artist Just come back from vacation While we sweltered in this humidity almost suffocating our Ludwig was on vacation I got the right paper for you A thousand sheets a whole packet on your desk I brushed your clothes pressed your trousers everything freshly laundered No more Steinhof smell No more Steinhof smell And if it rains in the afternoon then it is most pleasant not to have the feeling that you have to do anything Read a bit when the sky darkens draw the curtains read I can't bother with that when there's so much to do and everything falls to me more or less A matinee which was always our salvation as children is now out of the question afternoon tea at Aunt Margaret's how easy it was then to escape from despair a cup of cocoa and the map on the floor that's no longer enough Soon it won't even be enough to take a biography to bed with you Music is very often a salvation You're right but soon we'll not even bear listening to music when suddenly and then for ever our ears hate music because we misuse it in order to survive so to speak Thinking is quite undisturbed by that however much we misuse it it is always possible after a while everything begins to get on our nerves not thinking the person who thinks can grow old with impunity Or have a crazy idea all your life a single crazy idea Listening reading looking that's all nothing compared with this one single crazy idea but that is my problem A mathematical solution naturally solved absolutely mathematically How miserable I feel sometimes just like a dying man then suddenly everything's all right again because I think I shall overcome everything just by thinking not by being thoughtful by thinking I didn't intend to come here My sisters are my destroyers they annihilate me that's what I always tell myself I said to the director when my sister comes tell her that I don't want to go home if I go home it will be the death of me family means death and I have no friends if I disregard the fact that my fellow patients are my friends But she was relentless I didn't want to run the risk of quarreling with her lack of comprehension is the one bond between myself and my sisters that's what I thought you do understand me don't you you've always understood me better than your sister she has always only understood herself But I shall only stay home for a very short time I said to the director Two three days I'd be dead on the fourth you know There was a swallow in the kitchen hurt itself on the window That Anna only makes a mess I pay her the highest wages and she only makes a mess nothing is in its proper place everything's dirty the tragedy is that we are at the mercy of these people they exploit us blackmail us slander us into the bargain they drag us down into the dirt wherever they can treachery from below is vile Father was right Write a letter to Ireland this afternoon it's long overdue I'll write and tell them not to come what do they want here we haven't seen them for twenty years and just now of all times I never could stand our Irish relatives a very polite letter of refusal the afternoon will be ideal for that I said to the director that I knew how to deal with a philosopher gently I said at which he laughed Laughed I'll start acting again in the autumn Shakespeare that's the plan My sisters are actresses I told the director when I saw him for the first time be careful they're stinking rich and are actresses That was all I needed I said for my sisters to be slaves of the theatre not without talent I said but I hate the theatre there is nothing I find more odious but the fact is that we have to make the best of what we find the most odious Don't think I'm going to commit suicide which is what my relatives are afraid of it's an idea of course but I demand a natural death whatever that may be I shan't do away with myself never fear So even during my first stay they let me keep my suspenders As you see I said to the director this very morning I have not done away with myself You've known me these twenty years and to this day I haven't done away with myself Death after all comes to us of itself when we want it I said to the director we don't have to force it Here's a lovely piece of meat Ludwig perhaps you still have room We have our terminal disease and know that we shall die of it we can hasten this process of dying hold it up drag it out if we want to but of course we know that all that is just a matter of a short space of time and we say to ourselves at least let us pursue this thought a bit further throw that one away write this line down complete the chapter that's what gives us our greatest pleasure that's why we go on existing for no other reason for except that we think and cling to what we think as far as we can nothing is of interest to us anymore I mean my thinking and I We certainly didn't go to England for a pleasure trip but because we wanted to invigorate our thinking to replace something stale with something completely new I didn't go to Cambridge to get my English Ph.D. not for such a trifle but because I saw a chance there of thinking further than I had been able to up to that point All ties to relatives etcetera broken off for that purpose alone We cannot think when we are tied to people and their needs That does not mean that people do not interest us on the contrary all we've done was directed at them with the greatest intensity we have to free ourselves from them Always sought simplicity but never found it nothing but the process of our dying which makes us possible We strive our whole lives just for two or three pages of immortal writing we want no more but it is the highest goal all the same The director did not understand what I said the director's way of thinking isn't my way of thinking he isn't willing to think my thinking although it would be possible for him to think my thinking But I only have the director in Steinhof the patients are complete dullards that's what's so fascinating that they are such complete dullards At last walking tall again do you two know what that means It's only when we are sick that we are happy I thought that everything would be different but you haven't altered it Everything will be different I thought Cling to everything that's characteristic of you It can only be a short visit What are you saying Only a short visit The inferiority of life we become quite conscious of it when we return to a house like this which we have left forever We're going back we're going back don't you understand It's all right to let my sister think that I'm going back home I have no intention so I said to the director of turning my back on Steinhof this is my home nowhere else I said My room is always at my disposal I've got used to Steinhof I shall die in Steinhof not here there is nothing more repellent than dying in one's parents' house you two may do that it suits you it doesn't suit me For one moment I thought it would be nice just for a moment We are always searching for the right path and are always on it already Perhaps I am crazy it's possible Made it specially for you Ludwig your favourite gravy For heaven's sake leave him in peace I put myself out but it's not appreciated You know it's nothing more than a process of atrophy irresistible existence to escape from boredom but success is impossible boredom which is interrupted only by fear of death being irrevocably alone I thought but it was no use crawled away to a hole in Norway for the sake of an inadmissibility cooped up in a wooden hut with an idea without success destroyed everything in the end years of chastisement years of discipline everything burned in a single moment In Norway too they refused me entrance to the inn one glance sufficed to turn me away I thought anyone as undemanding as myself cannot gain admittance We have millions in our trouser pocket and cannot do anything with them Thinking things over is not stimulating but nauseating that's what's bad about it but it only has value when it's nauseating nauseating people valuable people We have tried everything and at the end we are always left on our own Desserts were always your forte Veal beef pork always ended up in a disaster of frying oil and batter Mother couldn't cook she detested the kitchen But since you're helping out with the cooking and She only heated the food up heated the food up it's not half bad I didn't want Anna to be here when you came home Came home came home This isn't my home When we submit to surgery our lives can under certain circumstances be lengthened but I don't want that Probability is something I hate We really do enter into a contract but we break it every contract has to be broken When we've signed a contract we have to break it Contracts are fatal Either we don't sign one or if we have signed one it has to be broken by us the whole of humanity is held together by contracts and is suffocated by those contracts This was the moment I feared when I should have to take exactly the same place that I sat in all through my childhood and most of my youth opposite my father I always hated him I wished him dead his death had no effect on my hatred All odious people from whom we have everything There is no reason to resume contact with the dead again Those who spawned us have ill rewarded us for being their children We are after all not the product of their minds It's true isn't it it's nothing more than calculated mockery The dining room the source of every calamity Father mother children nothing but players in hell everything of any value always drowned in soups and sauces whenever I had a real thought whenever I had a valuable thought mother drowned it in her soup whenever I had a real feeling whenever I had a valuable feeling she smothered it in her sauce And father unscrupulously tolerated what mother killed in me that's why I hated this dining room always hated it from this place from father's place nothing but death sentences were pronounced your fate was no different but I wasn't as crafty as you two I always fell into the trap with a more or less cool head Our parents weren't ashamed not even mother although shame should have been her duty I really had to hate them and hate them all my life in order to save myself first the English detour then the Norwegian one thought Cambridge University was the answer then thought the log cabin in Sognefjord was we give everything up in order to gain everything and at the end we are worth less than at the beginning To think we made music together as though it had been thousands of years ago What about it do you still play the viola now and then No no We give up almost everything when we give up the instrument which we have learned to play Acting is really a coarse art after all playing an instrument is an entirely different matter when an actor speaks I have the constant feeling that the world is a vulgar place it's quite different from the way I feel when a viola player plays the viola or even just the piano if it's played well of course Only a few weeks ago I had an idea of going back to Norway but now I'm too weak for that And besides that of course I have no reason to go back to Norway Why don't we just wait and see what Doctor Frege says Frege what makes you think of Doctor Frege I've made an appointment for you for tomorrow afternoon Nonsense there's no point in my going to Doctor Frege the man is a fool he's worse even than all the others he drove our parents into an early grave too there are doctors who only accelerate disease Frege what a bungler And you made an appointment for me tomorrow afternoon I'm not going What do you say your sister simply announces that tomorrow afternoon I am to see Doctor Frege I'm not going to any more doctors I'm not consulting any more doctors Aren't you going to eat any more Oh leave him in peace it really isn't so wonderful that we can't resist it I'm sure it isn't since you two have hardly eaten I remember last time Frege was here and I was present that archbishop was also here those people suit each other a man like Frege ruthless obtuse and a man like that archbishop devious through and through Those Freges etcetera are horrible people who we constantly run from but who catch up with us time and time again at first it's our parents then it's our teachers then it's those Freges etcetera You'd better beware of that Frege of those doctors and those medical superintendents especially the specialists All those people obfuscate the areas in which we have less and less freedom of movement Always hated always detested art nouveau perversity Norwegian concentration English intensity I'm not going to see Doctor Frege How dare you make an appointment for me with Doctor Frege To go behind my back with Doctor Frege Inability to concentrate Can't I even get a glass of water in this house Frege that murderous Frege No doctor please please no doctor they've all spelt nothing but misfortune for me I want to kick the bucket on my own without doctors Your post-prandial states of exhaustion Not Frege Frege no The director thought the first few days would be the hardest You ought to lie down after meals I've made a wonderful dessert all by myself not Anna I did it cream puffs your favourite dessert Cream puffs fresh from the oven Everything will be running smoothly soon it all takes time Of course you're exhausted But I'm not exhausted what do you mean exhausted a state of excitement isn't exhaustion at all The name Frege ought not to have been mentioned That Frege I spoke to the director I said what sort of doctor is best for my brother in his present condition Frege said the director my colleague Frege of course No doctor least of all Frege Incompetent people The director too is incompetent they charge exorbitant sums and are totally incompetent Grandmother wasn't it Embroidered this Of course by grandmother all our beautiful tablecloths were embroidered by our grandmother during summer vacations During summer vacations they were always embroidering and reading biographies of musicians weren't they No no self-control is everything never lose your self-control we hate everything that's embroidered even if grandmother embroidered it Some embroider and others philosophise their way through life but they are all hiding behind an absurdity and of course a lack of taste Cream puffs fresh from the oven that you are so fond of Cream puffs that I am so fond of Ludwig who's fond of cream puffs who's fonder of cream puffs than of anything else The whole time I was in Steinhof I thought of nothing but those cream puffs It's like the inside of a tomb here we're really already buried a delicious tomb in which cream puffs are served the typical cream puff aroma that's right isn't it they are freshly made for us so we'll finish them up The highest art is the art of baking When we eat them for the first time yes but then they grow more and more insipid and finally we end up hating them and then we hate nothing more than cream puffs even if we are continually told that we are fonder of cream puffs than of anything else You expect me to eat these cream puffs yes perhaps I'll even eat a cream puff perhaps the devil says eat the cream puff which your sister has baked the devil says so the devil says so and Ludwig eats it Ludwig is eating the cream puff that his sister has baked the older sister baked it the younger sister served it and now they are both waiting to see me eat their cream puff That-which-is-put-before-us If we take into account that with all those cream puffs with all those soups and sauces we have become old and ugly and dull-witted and worthless then it's completely logical for us to eat these cream puffs too every cream puff that is ever put on the table in front of us We wolf it down this cream puff that our sister has baked we open our mouth wide and stick the cream puff in and choke it down You see how I'm choking down your cream puff such a nauseating cream puff such a revolting cream puff my favourite dessert you see And now for the second cream puff the favourite dessert my favourite dessert that my sister has always made for me My favourite dessert my favourite dessert My favourite dessert Go away go away you don't touch me An etude my child so that I don't lose my touch only an etude I keep wondering how late it is To lend meaning to life To lend meaning to life They get so upset those two parasites histrionics perversity AFTER LUNCH You heard right fifty-one percent with that fifty-one percent our father bought our way into dramatic art looking to the future so to speak Father really had a genius for business and he knew what was essential for us It was just you he didn't know what to do with all his life he didn't With this fifty-one percent we still decide when to perform and when not whether in a Shakespeare or not Bought our way into dramatic art that's a clever remark That fifty-one percent makes it possible for us to employ our talent only when we see fit We do not allow ourselves to be cast arbitrarily and shamelessly or to be exploited unscrupulously and wasted The theatre manager is dependent on us so to speak not we on him And if for years at a time we don't feel like acting we don't act and if we do feel like it we act Shakespeare etcetera or a blind woman in an insipid play on the stage for two minutes The art of the theatre is independent only when it owns fifty-one percent of the shares to be honest I only feel the urge to act every few years but that's not to say that I neglect my talent even for a single day for two months our sister has rehearsed the blind woman in front of the window and since she has to dance for one minute out of the two she's taking dance lessons where she's learning how a blind woman dances that's not nearly as easy as you think we are probably the only ones who prepare for their appearance down to the last detail We have the time to intensify ourselves The three of us have never been compatible too high-strung too extraordinary Siblings united in intelligence in fact detested by everyone or at least always objects of suspicion Weirdness that's what they've always accused us of my spiritual Titanism indubitably the highest aspiration longing for humanity suicidal all three When we think we can rest easy we grow restless Wealth bestowed by chance which has made all the others incompetent allow ourselves to be talked into things delude ourselves that we can be saved longing for humanity suicidal Did everything wrong up till today Twelfth of July that was two days ago So many errors accumulated Here you have that too That's what we think about all our lives about nothing else until we give up because it makes no sense can make no sense Between you and me I'm not going to Frege I hate Frege I hate doctors but I hate that Doctor Frege most of all Those people are constantly burying us in their garbage see nothing think nothing behave like murderers and call themselves family doctors Mother was the malicious one not father mother is the culprit not father Went a little way with Schopenhauer with Nietzsche pernicious friendships paper ties book brothers printed love affairs In the end nothing but nauseating We enter books as we enter taverns hungry thirsty starving my child At first we are received with kindness are waited on but waited on worse and worse waited on worse and still worse and finally kicked out or else we leave the taverns at once of our own accord because we can't put up with the stench in them any longer the badly cooked food the miserably served food but not of course without paying a monstrous bill We enter those philosophies as we do open taverns and sit down at once at the regulars' table and we are surprised that we are not waited on at once to our most complete satisfaction We are thoroughly annoyed not least by the odious people who are throwing their weight around with us in this tavern We call for the landlord but the landlord doesn't come and even if at first we were possibly enthusiastic delighted possibly with the decor of the tavern we start to loathe it after a very short time we are badly seated there's a draft a noisome smell hangs in the air instead of the delicate aroma of roast meat which we had expected We are served by small odious waiters who have learned nothing and run around in their dull-witted way and finally bring everything to the table except the things we ordered The food is inedible the drinks poisoned and then when we try to call the landlord to account we are told the landlord has been dead these many years That's how we enter the great names which promised us a philosophical repast which always turns out to be inedible We enter books as we do taverns that's our misfortune We end up avoiding all taverns don't go into them any more no matter how dazzling the sign outside we walk past it It turns out that there are no tavern-owners left only unscrupulous tenants Mother loved you two more than me Father hated me but I loved him that's the truth The youngest girl is always loved the most pampered that's her death sentence Autarchy that's what father always ended up saying Have enough coal in the cellar for the next three winters I can still hear him saying it and also philosopher philosopher he isn't even good enough to be an actor Crafty sisters who were in the end much cleverer than him Head of an industrial tycoon that's what his brother said of him Uncle Friedrich No Uncle Karl The humorous fellow as opposed to the humorless one Painters are dull-witted too even when they are highly paid and highly renowned Uncle Friedrich is depicted as the humorous one Uncle Karl as the humorless exactly the opposite is true Painters simply have no eye They all had their portraits painted the fools This is where it belongs not there It really is a perversity hanging exactly opposite each other thirty years these pictures have been hanging on these walls not once taken down But now it's equally perverse don't you agree hanging opposite each other badly painted very badly painted famous artists but badly painted wretchedly painted Portrait fixation ancestor worship They have always made us suffer these hideous pictures The pictures are worth a fortune millions but they are hideous sometimes they are more in fashion sometimes less but they are always worth millions how hideous these pictures are Wasn't mother a beautiful woman attractive but in the picture she is repellent father didn't brood as he appears to in the picture Those artists abuse everything shamelessly they will paint one intolerable painting after another A musical family so it has always been said it's not even hinted at in any of these pictures Have their portraits painted that was the idea that kept haunting them You haven't had your portraits painted too you didn't get taken in I hope by a portrait-painting charlatan like that Have you had your portraits painted or not You did have your portraits painted you're shameless enough to have had your portraits painted by those anti-artists who are springing up everywhere today and who chum up to people and demand millions for their repellent daubs You did have your portraits painted And what if we did That was all I needed my sisters having their portraits painted in this period of anti-art this epoch of dilettantism where are those trumperies then where are the trumperies In the attic are you satisfied now In the attic in the attic do portraits belong in the attic Portraits don't belong in the attic you hid them in the attic so that I shouldn't see them to conceal them from me all the time I've been away they've probably been hanging on this wall you took them down and put them up in the attic before I came just yesterday just this morning that's the truth The pictures are badly painted Of course the pictures are badly painted portraits are always badly painted unless they're by Goya but Goya didn't paint you Goya never painted in Vienna never did Goya paint in Vienna I want to see them bring me the pictures bring the pictures this instant Bring the pictures bring me the pictures this instant What are you waiting for I said bring the pictures bring me the pictures which cost a fortune probably Having their portraits painted having their portraits painted for a fortune having their portraits painted for so much money Millions of children are starving in Africa and you have your portraits painted My sisters having their portraits painted just as their parents did Odious patronage Bring me the pictures I want to see the pictures Empty walls I've always liked empty walls This gallery full of atrocities has always turned my stomach Hideous pictures unartistic insipid Having their portraits painted they've had their portraits painted Art of painting a base form of art base to the core Consorting with painters With painters they grow rich and wealthy and consort with those painters And then that riffraff sits about everywhere fouling the air painters' effluvium artistic whitewash This one perhaps maybe this no it's not art not art no Music yes painting no It's all very arty in keeping with the times You've had your portraits painted portraits painted But why don't you turn them round do turn them round if indeed we're dealing with works of art here probably by a famous artist The contemporary has always repelled me Show yourselves what do you look like how did your artist paint you And then my sisters expect me to forgive them for this tastelessness I don't feel like doing that nauseating mannerism I won't ask what these atrocities cost like one of those people who drive in Rolls-Royces painted them Having your portraits painted and consorting with shamelessness itself I don't think the pictures are so bad Not so bad you don't think they're so bad You've never been able to relate to painting Not been able never been able And why did you hide the pictures in the attic surely not because they are so magnificent Hideous and not even good likenesses of you and unartistic A young artist a very young painter A friend of Doctor Frege put him in touch with Frege put him in touch with Frege A young American Whose grandparents emigrated to America from Germany A talented artist But this is a declaration of bankruptcy a declaration of bankruptcy A fortune for a piece of vulgarity In comparison even those trumperies are works of art I cannot even say disfigured beyond recognition for that would at least be something It was only to help a young artist that was all Young artists cannot be helped there is no greater folly than helping young artists helping artists at all is folly Let artists help themselves above all let young artists help themselves that's precisely why young artists come to nothing because they are constantly being helped help an artist and you destroy him above all help a young artist and you destroy and annihilate him that's the truth There is nothing more repellent than assuming the cloak of patronage But what is said is not heard I have always loathed patronage Wealthy people patrons hypocrites Visiting the brother in Steinhof nothing but hypocrisy going behind his back at home having your portraits painted having your portraits painted then hanging up what was painted and when your brother comes home taking down what was hung from the walls and hiding it in the attic It was her idea wasn't it not yours It was my idea Doctor Frege Doctor Frege suggested it to you Yes Doctor Frege Doctor Frege Doctor Frege Not enough that he ruined your brother he also makes arrangements for you to have your portraits painted But while those atrocities entered the annals of art history long ago these trumperies will not be entered into the annals of art history this era will not be entered into the annals of art history as a shameful blot of emptiness yes as a catastrophe yes as an artistic catastrophe as a gigantic art crater into which people will peer a hundred years from now and get nothing but a stench nothing else nothing else Empty walls that's what I always said my Norwegian log cabin is quite empty too no pictures nothing Empty walls But of course it will have to be repainted or freshly wallpapered for fifty years not one fresh coat of paint nothing wallpapered this smell That's what it looked like once the wallpaper Wasn't any better either The new is still more hideous it's time something was changed here for once The house belongs to us not to the dead any more Why aren't you two helping help me for heaven's sake Come on push for heaven's sake push for heaven's sake Half a metre to the left half a metre only half a metre Only half a metre perhaps it's nailed down Push only half a metre Push Concentrate and push Dreadful No wonder gently push very gently that's what I said not jerkily steadily but not jerkily The beautiful Herend plates the beautiful Bohemian teapot good lord The most beautiful pieces all broken The most beautiful pieces Gently I said steadily but gently not jerkily If only we could move the clock just half a metre to the left it would be of an improvement but I'll do it on my own Why do you want to move the clock For as long as I can think it has bothered me that the clock is there Just half a metre to the left just to try it perhaps No no good no good The clock probably doesn't belong in the dining room at all it's a dirty trick having a clock in the dining room What do you say where shall we put the clock but the clock must go I can't bear the sight of the clock Perhaps in the small drawing room there is no clock in the small drawing room Right there isn't a clock in the small drawing room It will go well in there in the small drawing room In the small drawing room you're right that's where it belongs it's insipid in the dining room and besides it doesn't even keep time it's half an hour fast and it has to be wound up every other day One day it will collapse and kill you But I won't be around to see it Whitewash is healthy fresh whitewash white fresh whitewash Father suffered from a hatred of wallpaper Women are in favour of wallpaper hate whitewash women hate whitewash that's been proven There are those who hate wallpaper and those who hate whitewash without more ado we can divide humanity into these two groups into the group that hates wallpaper and into the group that hates whitewash The string quartets they have always calmed me I am allowed to play them for myself as often as I like said the director he was corruptible too I put horrendous sums in his coat pocket these people will take any amount of money I'm allowed to listen to the string quartets I'm allowed to read I'm allowed to occupy myself intellectually as the director always says Rich people live on bribery Around eight I listen to the Eroica conducted by Knappertsbusch Twenty-seventh of May Eroica twenty-eighth of May Eroica twenty-ninth of May Eroica thirtieth of May Eroica thirty-first of May Eroica first of June Eroica etcetera Older sister Logic One transcribed like a good girl Exact bookkeeping extraordinarily exact bookkeeping Older sister tastelessly dressed as always sits there for hours doesn't say a word doesn't understand anything younger sister never seen her on the stage probably no talent exclamation mark like the older one exclamation mark but they keep getting another chance because father bought fifty-one percent of the shares in the theatre in which they appear from time to time parenthesis out of sheer boredom pre-war shares A sample Our brooder our know-it-all our charming note-taker When I'm in London I tell myself Norway is the place when I'm in Norway I tell myself London then when I don't know how to go on to Steinhof But I have not been declared legally incompetent that should give you something to think about I'm the only one in Steinhof not declared legally incompetent I enjoy a fool's license little sister It's possible Possible you say possible I always think you are totally without talent and then time and again that you are the most talented of all on the stage She's so easily hurt your sister a trifle and she's insulted upset anyway we don't do people any harm and they are angry with us she's probably doing the dishes ironing She took a lot of trouble to make things nice for you she wanted to make your return more pleasant More pleasant make things nice female stupidities I said I'm going home for just a few days only a few days I said what's it like here I wanted to see but it's just as I imagined And also because I was looking for a book a particular copy of Schopenhauer but I can't find it a lot of books missing God knows what's become of the books I want to talk to her but she's in a hurry Whispering with the director behind my back about Frege to deliver me up to that man who calls himself a family doctor We go to him because our bladder hurts and he looks into our ears we say we have a pain in our right knee he taps our chest and we have no medical insurance so we spend a fortune on these people enormous consumption of specialists medicine is a perverse preservation of monuments As it's now in fashion again to cut your hair short I'm letting mine grow I don't follow fashion fashion is something I've always hated the two of you follow fashion A world which constantly confuses cause and effect Suffer from megalomania that's right trusted Schopenhauer trusted Nietzsche never trusted myself time and time again I was suddenly abandoned by everybody Next I wrote polished my shoes at half past two in the morning Histrionics Calumny World of entertainment Your sister suffers from paranoia a fetish for dishes porcelain disease Make things nice by putting cream puffs on the table in front of me but doesn't want to listen to what I'm saying despises my inmost being but insists that I eat her cream puffs As you can see I do eat them with disgust Not going to Doctor Frege Frege's to blame for my being sick in the first place Am I sick I am sick I am not sick I tell your sister I want to go to a concert she takes out a season's subscription I tell her I want a cream puff and she regales me with dozens of them I say I want to be left in peace and she keeps asking if I want peace If we made one mistake we made thousands if we fell in the brook once we always fall in the brook if we told one lie we've always lied Whatever we do and whatever we say it's multiplied in the most diabolical fashion But she transcribes my manuscripts carefully I must grant her that But I'm very stingy with my praise if we praise someone we are immediately exploited if we say something complimentary we immediately pay the price An earthquake to be sure would have devastating consequences but the old houses don't collapse as we know look at San Francisco look at San Francisco I wish this country would disappear one day or better still some night all of a sudden in an earthquake this odious fatherland off the face of the earth Then again I think we haven't got a better one Here you see where I burned myself a burn wound not unintentionally I held the candle under my hand until it was half burnt through and here on my neck I still have the marks of my strangulation attempt What have we here asked the resident in his sly manner A strangulation attempt last night I replied at which he laughed out loud Then why on earth didn't you hang yourself properly said the resident Do you think I'm crazy I replied I'm not going to hang myself you must know that a strangulation attempt doesn't mean that I intend to hang myself no no I said as you know everything concerning me bogs down in the attempt at which the resident laughed out loud again There's a thousand schilling bill I said to him and now be off he took the thousand schilling bill and went The residents are corruptible and the residents' assistants are most easily corrupted It's only because I feed them thousand schilling bills that I'm still alive Steinhof is an institution of corruption Those who haven't got any money don't survive long that's the truth they hate every new arrival they look forward to mine Worringer's coming runs like wildfire through Steinhof it resounds through the whole institution Worringer the millionaire is coming that's what they say then all those white coats rush in and bow and scrape and let me feed them If I were to say they should wipe my behind as I want it done of course as I want it done they would fight for the privilege In return I let them abuse me by calling me a philosopher which they have long grown accustomed to doing And what have we got here I bought you some new underpants Freshly laundered and ironed But these are wonderful cotton underpants I wonder if they'll fit They're your size My size My size you say my size My size my size maybe they are my size But aren't they too soft I hate soft underpants I've always hated them all my life I had underpants which were too soft You always wore silk underpants Because my mother had got it into her head and I had got into the habit and never anything but silk underpants Very common coarse cotton underpants They are From Switzerland Swiss cotton underpants so-called Alpine cotton underpants The dependable Mont Blanc underpants Mont Blanc underpants of course the dependable Mont Blanc underpants they really do fit if I had my way I put them on at once may I No no not here not now not here for heaven's sake not in the dining room here no But why not If he wants to why not put them on here and now Fabulous the dependable Mont Blanc underpants Go on put them on here why not No you can't do that That's simply preposterous why shouldn't he put on his underpants now Not while I'm here you can't do that give them to me be sensible Why bring the underpants in now if he's not permitted to put them on Not permitted to not permitted to permission denied You're not permitted to you heard didn't you You have no shame Silly idiot She loves you unhappily now as always she hasn't changed she found out you liked long coarse cotton underpants immediately she bought a pile of these long coarse underpants Why didn't you put on the underpants you should have taken off your trousers and put on your underpants Oh you disgust me both of you You should have put on the underpants this false hypocritical modesty From the day she was born hypocritical What do you think she's doing now She's burying her face in the underpants which you held in your hands Brings your underpants into the dining room then stops you from putting them on Where did you burn yourself Where show me I want to have another look show me A big hole With the candle you say burned your own hand Probably in the middle of the night Did it hurt very much But you didn't manage to burn it right through that would have been a triumph to have burned right through your own hand In complete secrecy Are you mad you'll break my neck Shall we drink black coffee Yes of course right Ludwig Did you take a close look at her Just as I told you She buried her face in your underpants That's part of the therapy isn't it As long as father was alive we weren't allowed to play the Eroica Besides he hated Knappertsbusch he loved Furtwangler The Viennese all have a Beethoven complex a Schubert complex or a Beethoven complex they're all infected with it in the wealthy suburbs they're all infected We are all wealthy suburbanites wealthy suburbanites that's what we are Ludwig wealthy suburbanites Now she's gone and fallen over the silly idiot stay here Have you hurt yourself Good lord you're bleeding come here Lost my footing Indeed Everything's driving me crazy You're just too hard on yourself Pity about the coffee Oh never mind it's a pity about the china Grandmother's lovely china It had to be grandmother's Bohemian china Nervousness is an affliction Probably a change in the weather trouble brewing probably The things we like are all of a sudden strewn on the floor grandmother's lovely china A fatality mechanism I'm not going to Frege not to Frege Sisters underlined in red infantilism excessive infantilism The century of uncertainty Total stultification at the turn of the millennium Congregation of hypocrites Chronic despondency The director said that a time would come when even in Steinhof there would be no more pea soup Richesse oblige don't forget that Half a metre to the right First clear it out then push it The clock must go fought for a hundred years against illiteracy and achieved nothing If we publish it then we'll be dead Always preferred cotton They didn't give me my doctorate in Cambridge they were all against me although I wanted the doctorate I always said that I didn't want it and yet I wanted it I said I didn't want it it was a farce and yet I wanted it Wasn't given to me We're going astray with Schopenhauer Great need for geometry great need for coffee no need for company I asked for size five they didn't have it I had to wait three days everybody wants this cotton underwear nowadays As we've got such a lot of china it doesn't matter True A lot of sugar please - Where is the sugar - I'll get it Do you still own the Norwegian log cabin I thought you'd sold it And when are you going back to Norway I don't know Let's see you had to climb up a cliff even to get to it you can't do that any more you're much too weak You are the only privileged person in Steinhof You can do anything you want there almost anything That's because you pay seven thousand a day they'll let you stay on in Steinhof for years and years For heaven's sake do sit down you're a bundle of nerves it's not Ludwig who is it's you Rainy afternoon in all likelihood best thing is to spend it in bed I'll do some ironing There's nothing nicer than a rainy afternoon in bed Ritter, Dene, Voss, intelligent actors. During my work on the play, which I completed two years after writing that note, my thoughts dwelt mainly on my friend Paul and on his uncle, Ludwig Wittgenstein. Th. B.
