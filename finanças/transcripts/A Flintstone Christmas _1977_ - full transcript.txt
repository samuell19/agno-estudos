[instrumental music] Gee, mommy. Can't you go faster? I wanna get the tree home. Your daddy will have a great time decorating it, Pebbles. Yeah, it's a beautiful tree, Wilma. (Wilma) Thanks, Betty. [music continues] [bells jingling] [bell ringing] Another Christmas here already, huh, Fred? Yeah. Heh heh. What a great time of the year, Barn. [train whistles] Hey, look at those toys. Boy, oh, boy, aren't they great? 'I never had toys like that when I was a kid.' [chuckles] Yeah. The kids today don't know how good they have it. [bell ringing] Merry Christmas, Santa. Ho ho ho! Ho ho ho! And a Merry Christmas to you. [laughs] Look at all those happy faces, Barn. There's just no other holiday like it. [chuckles] Yeah, that's for sure, Fred. There you go. And ho ho ho, my good Santa. Ho ho ho! And a Merry Christmas! A few more of those ho-ho-hos and you'll be bro-o-oke for Christmas. Well, I just can't say no to Santa Claus. Vroom. Well, those guys in those corny suits aren't the real Santa Claus, you know? Oh, I wouldn't be too sure, Fred. He's here, he's there.

[barking] [laughs] That middle one reminds me of my boss, Mr. Slate. I wonder if Bamm-Bamm would like a pet for Christmas. Look, Fred, isn't he cute? Yeah, he is kinda cute, but what can you use him for? Well, he could be a watchdog. [laughs] This little thing? What can he do? - Yikes! - Bite. He he he. [instrumental music] (Wilma) 'Fred, what are you doing up there?' (Fred) 'I forgot to put the star on the tree last night, Wilma.' Hand it up to daddy, Pebbles. Be careful, daddy. Don't worry, Pebbles, daddy knows exactly what he's doing. Maybe you should move the ladder a little closer, Fred. Now, Wilma, have a little confidence. That's what I have, Fred. A little confidence. Do you think it's safe to go in if a mighty gut isn't through with his breakfast? Oh, Barney, pull the bell. Okay, but he can get real mean. Ding ding ding. That must be the Rubbles. Barney said he'd drop by and take me to work. (Wilma) 'I'll get it.' No, no. No, no, no, Dino. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slurp slurp slurp [chuckles] Stop it, Dino! - Stop it! - Down, Dino, down! [chuckles] Come on in. Fred's decorating the tree. Crash. Oh, it is a beautiful tree. Yeah, especially that fat little ornament. Ha ha ha. Very funny, Barney. Now stop with the jokes and get me down. Okay, Fred, okay. Don't forget your Christmas spirit. Oh, sure. Ho ho ho. Have you asked Fred about, you know? Twice and he said no, no too. You know, but the third time's the charm. I hope. Well, I gotta admit, Fred, it looks pretty good. Yep. Now I gotta find a place for this last ornament. No problem, Fred. Here's the perfect place for it. Are you kiddin', Barn? This is the perfect spot for it. I wouldn't hang it there, Fred. "I wouldn't hang it there, Fred." Why not? Uh, don't look now, Fred, but here comes the why not? [gasps] Crash [tinkling] You okay, daddy? Yeah. [laughs] Good thinking, Fred. You broke the tree's fall. [laughs] Barney, get me out of here. Oh, don't worry, Fred. Bamm-Bamm will fix it. After all, he's the strongest little boy in the world. (Wilma) 'That's very nice, Bamm-Bamm.' Thank you, Auntie Wilma. Why don't you and Pebbles listen to some records? 'Mommy has to talk to daddy.' Okay, mommy. Come on, Bamm-Bamm. Okay. Oh, uh, Fred. It's the day before Christmas and there's the party tonight. Right, the Ladies' Auxiliary Party for the Bedrock Orphanage and... Yeah, I know what you're gonna ask, Betty and for the third time, the answer is no. Hey, uh, what are they gonna ask, Fred? We want Fred to play Santa. It would be a joke, Wilma. The guys at work would never let me live it down. Besides, where would you get a suit big enough to fit him? [laughs] You see what I mean? Come on, Barn, we'd better get to work. - Have a good day, dear. - Oh, thanks, Betty. Thought I forgot, huh? He he he. It sure is hard to stay mad at him. [both laughing] [instrumental music] Screech. - Thanks, Barney. See you later. - Uh, just be good today, Fred. Remember, Santa comes tonight and he knows who's been naughty and who's been nice. [laughs] "He knows who's been naughty and who's been nice." Oh, boy. (male #1) Hey, Fred. Mr. Slate's waitin' to see you in his office. - Uh, M-M-Mr. Slate? Me? - Don't worry, Fred. I'll help you look for another job after the holidays. [laughs] I haven't been late. I'm conscientious. I'm diligent. I don't take long lunch hours. What does he wanna see me for? Ting. Goin' down! (Fred) What could it be? I wonder what he wants to see me about. Hurry it up, Otis. This is supposed to be an express elevator. Huh? [Fred mumbling] I treat the equipment right. I stay late sometimes. Wow. What could it be? [clicking] - Uh, eh, excuse me. - Yes? Um, um, uh, Mr. Slate wants to see me. - Name? - Eh, Flintstone. - Fred Flintstone. - One moment. Mr. Slate, a Mr. Flintstone to see you. Squawk. Mr. Slate, a Mr. Flintstone is there to see you. Send him in. Squawk. 'Send him in.' [squawk] - You can go in. - Uh, thanks. Eh, it's a living. Flintstone, how long have you been with me? Eh, eh, uh, not nearly long enough, Mr. Slate. [chuckles] I want you to think about another job. Oh, no, please, Mr. Slate. I really need this job. Don't throw me out in the street, please. - Flintstone. - Yes? Could you grovel standing up? - Yes, sir. - Fred. The Ladies' Auxiliary is having a Christmas party for underprivileged kids tonight and Mrs. Slate wants you to play Santa Claus. - Me? - Yep. [stutters] That's the other job? Right. Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you. Thank you. I'll be happy to play Santa Claus. 'Oh, what an honor. What a privilege.' Please thank Mrs. Slate for me. [clears throat] I guess it's because of my acting, huh? No, it's because you're fat. Wise guy. [clears throat] Uh, I'm very busy, Flintstone. Uh, take the Santa Claus suit on your way out. Yes, sir. Oh, you can count on me, boss. I won't let you and Mrs. Slate down. You'll see. I'll make the best Santa you ever saw. I'll make those kids so happy, you'll be proud of me. Oh, Merry Christmas. Flintstone, will you get out of my closet? Sorry, boss. [laughs] Merry Christmas, Mr. Slate. Phew. Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. Yabba-dabba-doo!

[laughs] He sure loves you, Fred. Now get off, Dino. [Dino mumbles] Thanks, Wilma. Wow, you'll never guess what happened. - You've cancelled Christmas. - Oh, come on, Wilma. I love Christmas as much as anyone. I am gonna play Santa Claus at the Women's Auxiliary. You're what? What made you change your mind, Fred? Well, when I got to work Mr. Slate invited me into his office. He offered me a cigar, you know, tryin' to butter me up? Uh-huh. Go on. Yeah, well, he said Mrs. Slate wanted me to do it and that he agreed because of my fantastic acting ability. Yuk. Oh, sure, Fred. Well, maybe he didn't put it exactly like that. Oh, it doesn't matter, Fred. I think you'll be a terrific Santa because you're lovable. Thanks, honey. He he he. - Hey, is Pebbles around? - No. She's playing next door with Bamm-Bamm. Good. Then I can try on my Santa suit. Gosh, Wilma. The least they could have done was gotten me a new suit. Well, you'll look just fine once you put the Santa hat on, Fred. Ta-da! Hey, you're right, honey. What'd I tell you, Fred? You're a perfect Santa Claus. Yeah. He he. I always said you had terrific taste, Wilma. Ho ho ho! You hear that, Wilma? Pretty good, huh? - Ho ho... - 'Ho ho!' - Uh-oh. - Congratulations, Wilma. Uh, how did you finally talk him into it? I didn't. It was Mrs. Slate. - 'Bless her!' - You see, Fred? Everyone knows you're the one guy to play Santa Claus. [laughs] After all, you've got the round little belly 'that shakes like a bowl full of jelly!' [laughs] Eh? Eh, just throwin' myself into the part, Barn. Terrific, 'cause you sure got a lot to throw. [laughs] Very funny, Barney, but watch it. I'm leaving now, Fred. Betty and I promised to help get things ready for the party tonight. We'll take Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm with us. Good idea, Wilma. You're gonna make a lot of children happy by playing Santa tonight. Oh, I'm proud of you, Fred. Mwah. Mwah. See you later, honey. You sure got a great girl there, Fred. Boy, do I ever, Barney. [rumbles] What's that? Thud. What was that? [intense music] Over there, Fred. 'It looks like someone really took a spill.' (Fred) Yeah, come on. Okay, Barney, grab a leg and pull. [both grunts] Come on. Argh. Yah! Thud. It's a pair of boots. Those are my boots, so hand them over. Wow-wee! It's Santa Claus! Yeah, you're a long way from your corner, Santa. Well, so are you. Ho ho ho. Huh? Oh, the suit! Well, I'm playing Santa at a Christmas party tonight. Yeah, everybody gets into the act this time of year. Psst. Hey, Fred. I think he is the real Santa. And I think you flipped when he slipped, pal. I didn't slip, Flintstone. I tripped! When are you ever going to fix your roof? It's like an obstacle course. My roof? Hey, Barney, this guy really plays his part to the hilt. I, uh, seem to have sprained my ankle. Oh, of all nights to do it. Yeah, we better bring him inside, Barney. Gee, Fred. He really could be Santa, you know? Yeah and I could be the Easter Bunny. [laughs] (Santa) Oh. Careful. Easy. Oh. [panting] Thanks, gentlemen. Um, do you mind if I use your phone, Flintstone? Okay. Hey, but no long-distance calls. Hello, operator? Will you please get me the North Pole? North Pole? Oh, boy, Barn, we got a real lulu on our hands. Hey, uh, you should not talk about Santa that way, Fred. 'Cause he not only knows when you've been naughty and nice he knows when you've called him a lulu. Alright, operator, but please, hurry. Hey, Barn, get over to your house and call the asylum. Tell 'em we've got one of their guys here. Uh, gee, Fred, uh, I don't know. Will you quit being so gullible and get movin'? Mmm, maybe Fred's right. Maybe Santa really isn't Santa. Maybe, he's, uh.. [chiming] Hey, hey, Fred! Fred! Screech Barney, will you stop yellin'? Just get goin' and make that call. [muffled] What are you tryin' to say? Uh, on the roof. Santa's reindeer! Barney, there's nothing up on the.. Santa's reindeer. What'd I tell you, Barn? It's really Santa Claus. In there! In my house! So what have I been tellin' him? Come on, we gotta make him comfortable. Oh, there, there, Mr. Claus. Uh, is that better, Mr. Claus? Are you quite comfortable there, Mr. Claus? Well, yes, uh, thanks, gentle uh, uh, gentle, uh, uh, gentle.. Achoo! Oh-oh, Mr. Claus, sir. It, uh, looks like you're catchin' a cold. Yes, Rubble. Sniff sniff. As if a sprained ankle wasn't bad enough. Well, if you don't mind my saying so, Santa I don't see how you can be expected to fly all over the world in your condition. Yeah, right, uh, going through snowstorms and climbin' up and down chimneys.. You're absolutely right, Flintstone, but if I don't millions of children will be disappointed. Santa, you wanna get someone to take your place. Right, Flintstone, but where am I gonna get somebody that jolly, that dedicated, this fat? Hey, Santa. Have I got an idea? The perfect substitute is standing right there. - Where? - Fred, I mean you. Me? Fill in for Santa Claus? Well, at least you look the part. Y-y-yeah, Fred, a-and I could be your elf. Ho ho ho! That's a good idea, Rubble. And all it takes is a little Christmas magic. [chiming] Gee, look at me. I'm Santa's helper. [chuckles] We're a team now, Fred. Mmm, well, not quite, Rubble. Uh, we've got to do something about that suit... Fred is wearing. [chiming] (Barney) It's a perfect fit, Fred. [laughs] If I didn't know you were you, Flintstone I'd think you were me. Yeah, but really being Santa's a big important job. How can I deliver Christmas presents all over the world in just one night? Oh, there's nothing to it. Now just listen carefully and I'll give you a few pointers. 'Now watch out for low-flying pterodactyls' 'and for TV aerials when you come in for landings' 'and for reindeer, yes.' 'Snap the reins once for take-off' 'twice for left-turn..' - 'Three times for right.' - Right. 'One slow, and two fast for reverse and..' 'You got that, Flintstone?' Oh, yeah, yeah. Leave it to me. It's in the able hands of Fred Flintstone. Come on, Barn. - Oop. - Oh, boy. I hope he flies better than he walks. [chiming] Uh, I can't remember how Santa said to start this thing, Barn. Well, you just call out the names of all the reindeer, Fred. Yeah. Oh, oh, yeah. Yeah. On, Jumper! On, uh, uh, Thunder. 'On, Bouncer, and, uh, Plunder!' - 'On, uh..' - Oh, oh, oh, Fred. Fred. It's-it's on, Dasher, on, Dancer, on, Prancer. On, Vixen, on, Comet, on, Cupid, on Donner, on Blitzen! [instrumental music] (Fred) I did it! I did it! I remembered! Fred, you're really getting the hang of this thing. Santa will be proud of you. Thanks, Barn. You know something? I think I was made for this job. Yabba-dabba-doo! Thud. - Hey. Hey, Fred. You okay? - Sure, I'm okay. There's nothing I like better than fallin' down chimneys. Now throw down the presents. Thud. Thanks, Barn. Well, the kids are sure having a good time, Mr. Slate. So far, Wilma, but this party will be a bust without Santa Claus. Wherever he is. Hey, Fred. You about finished? (Fred) 'I've been finished a long time.' 'I just can't get back up.' [grunting] It's.. Thud. Oh, um, why don't you try the front door? The front door? I was just gonna try that. Yeow! Hurry, Barney, let's get out of here! [instrumental music] How come I have to go down the chimney, Fred? 'I'm just an elf.' Because we'll never get finished if you don't. 'You'll fit better than I do.' [laughs] That's a fact. Now when I say go you lower yourself down the chimney. Yeah, okay, Fred. I'm the elf and you're the boss. Here goes. What the.. Barney! Thud. 'Next time wait till I say go!'

On, Dancer. On.. Oh-oh! Looks like we're headin' into a storm. Correction, pal. We are in a storm. Hold on! I'll see if we can fly over it. Giddy-up, reindeer! Up. Up. Up! [dramatic music] This must be what they call bumpy air. (Barney) 'Yeah, and we just bumped the presents out.' - What do we do now? - Oh, boy. There's a million kids out there countin' on us. Uh, look, Fred. Isn't that one of those CB radios? It sure is. Well, maybe you could reach Santa Claus and find out what to do. Yeah. Ahem. Hello, Santa? Not that way, Fred, you gotta use CB talk. Eh, let me show you. Breaker, breaker. Sky Sled to Big Red. - Do you have a copy? - A copy of what? It means do you understand and can you hear me? (Barney) 'Uh, Sky Sled to Big Red. Do you have a copy?' Huh? What? Who said that? (Barney) 'Sky Sled to Big Red. Do you have a copy, Big Red?' You're wall to wall and treetop tall. 'And you don't have to tell me. You blew it.' It's true! Santa does know everything. Let me talk to him. Santa? It's me, it's Fred. We were doin' great until we ran into the storm and.. Slow down, Flintstone. Slow down. Did you say storm? (Fred) 'That's right, Santa.' We're okay and so are the reindeer but we still need presents for half the kids in the world. Well, there's nothing to do, but go to my workshop at the North Pole and pick up another load. (Fred) Hey, that's a terrific idea. But tell me, how do we get there? (Santa) 'Just tell the reindeer to head for home.' - 'They know the way.' - Thanks, Santa. Okay, guys, you heard Santa. Let's head for home. (Barney) North Pole, here we come. That's right, t-they're on their way, dear. They lost the presents. They're a couple of bumblers but their hearts are in the right place. [instrumental music] Oh, my goodness. Yes, Mr. Flintstone, Mr. Rubble. My husband phoned you were coming and our elves have almost finished filling up a whole new sack of presents. - Gosh, Santa's workshop. - Wow. (Barney) 'Hey, those rocking dinos are just like the one' 'I had when I was a kid.' (Fred) 'Yeah, and I had one of those model trains.' [chuckles] I loved playing with it whenever I could get it away from my father. It sure is a busy place, Mrs. Claus. Well, Mr. Flintstone we've got the biggest Christmas list of all to fill. - 'Every child in the world.' - Yeah. Well, we'll have you on your way again as soon as we finish a few more toys. - Maybe we can help. - Yeah, we're good with tools. (Mrs. Claus) Well, that would be very nice, gentlemen.

Children, please, Santa should be here any minute now 'because Santa loves little children' and he better get here soon. Oh, Betty, I'm really worried about the boys. They should have been here a long time ago. Don't worry, Wilma. They're probably just planning a dramatic entrance. Well, if they don't get here soon it'll be a very dramatic exit for Fred when Mr. Slate throws him out on his ear. Some Christmas present that'll be. A pink slip. [chuckles] It's going like clockwork, Barney. Watch this. Bull's eye, Fred. [chuckles] Too bad you can't drop a bowling ball down the old alley like that. Watch this one, Barn. 'I call it the old twistaroo.' (Barney) 'And you just made another kid happy.' [laughing] This is more fun than having a party. Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no. What's the matter, Fred? The party, the Christmas party. - We forgot all about it. - Oh-oh. I'm done for, Barn. Mr. Slate will kill me. Uh, before or after he fires you? That'll be a great present for Wilma and Pebbles. Don't give up yet, Fred. Maybe Santa can tell us how to speed things up so we can get back to Bedrock. Yeah, maybe he can. Calling Big Red. Urgent! Urgent! [instrumental music] What did I tell you, Fred? Didn't I tell you Santa would come up with something? [laughing] Yeah, pushing that super speed button really did it. Get ready, Barn. Here's another town. Presents away! (Fred) 'Merry Christmas.' (Barney) 'Merry Christmas.' (Fred) 'Ho ho ho!' 'Merry Christmas.' [music continues] (Fred) You know, Barn. We just might make it back to Bedrock in time for the party after all. - 'We want Santa.' - 'We want Santa.' - We want Santa. We want Santa. - We want Santa. We want Santa. - We want Santa. - We want Santa. I can understand the kids being upset, Wilma. And Mr. Slate too. [groans] Wait till I get my hands on that Flintstone. (Barney) 'Swiss village at 10,000 feet.' (Fred) 'Stand-by for final Christmas presents drop.' 'Merry Christmas.' Final drop completed, substitute Santa Claus. Good work, substitute Santa's helper. Okay, team. Next stop, Bedrock. 'Yabba-dabba-doo!' - 'We want Santa.' - 'We want Santa.' - We want Santa. We want Santa. - We want Santa. We want Santa. - We want Santa. - We want Santa. Wilma, if I have to go out and tell those kids Santa isn't going to be here... Oh, I just know Fred will be here soon, Mr. Slate. Well, if he isn't here in one minute he needn't show up at all, here or at work. Mama, Santa's not coming, is he? Oh, Pebbles, we can't give up hope. Hope? (Wilma) 'Yes, like that Christmas tree.'

Ten seconds more and you would have been fired, Flintstone. But not after an entrance like that. Welcome, Santa Claus. - Welcome to Bedrock. - Uh, gee, thanks, Mr. Slate. And now what about the presents for all the children, Santa? Right here in Santa's sack, Mr.. Uh-oh, I forgot. We got rid of all the presents, Barn. (all) Presents, presents. - We want presents. - We want presents. Hey, what about some of that Christmas magic, Fred? - Maybe it'll work for you. - I'll give it a try, Barn. I can't lose anything. What are you two talking about? Where are the presents? Uh, right here, sir. I hope. [children cheering] You did it. You did it. Yeah. He he he. I guess there's a little Christmas magic in all of us. Hey, hey, Fred. You know something? We forgot about the real Santa Claus. Uh-oh, you're right, pal. He's gonna wanna be heading back to the North Pole. Time for us to make our exit. Come on. [instrumental music] (Santa) 'Ho ho, you did a fine job, Fred and Barney.' If I ever get in a spot again, I'll give you a call. Anytime, Santa, anytime. You know, once you get the hang of it, it's a lot of fun. [laughing] And you can be sure Fred will always fit the part. [laughing] Yeah, and that goes for you, too, little elf. [laughs] (Santa) 'Well, there's just one more thing you can do for me, Fred.' - Just name it, Santa. - You can give me back my suit. I'd hate anyone to see me flying around in my long underwear. [laughs] Yeah, gee and I was just getting used to it. (Wilma) Oh, just wait till I get my hands on Fred. Running out on us like that. Yeah, first they worry us all night long and then they skip out on the clean-up assignment. 'I'm going to give Barney a piece of my mind too.' Uh-oh, something tells me the girls have already forgotten the Christmas spirit. Oh, yeah, especially the part that says. Goodwill toward men and your husbands most of all. Not to mention Santa's. I'd better be flying, my friends or my wife will be mad, too. Uh, one last question before you go, Santa. Certainly, Fred. What is it? (Fred) 'I finally got the knack of going down the chimneys' but I sure had trouble getting back up. Tell me, what's the secret? (Santa) 'Ho ho ho, I'm sorry, Fred.' I should have told you. You just lay your finger alongside your nose and give a nod. - And up the chimney he goes. - Amazing. (Wilma) 'So there you are.' Daddy, daddy, we saw Santa Claus. And his little elf, wow. Now, Wilma, let me explain. Go ahead and it had better be good, Fred. That goes for you too, Barney. What happened tonight? Gee, Betty, we had to pitch in and help Santa 'when he fell off the roof and hurt his ankle.' That's right, we had to fly around the world to deliver all the Christmas presents. [laughs] Oh, sure, Fred. (Fred) 'But, Wilma..' Come on, Fred. You don't have to make up stories. Not when you're so cute in your Santa suit. (Betty) 'And you were such a cute little elf, Barney.' - They don't believe us, Barn. - Of course, we don't. But we do forgive you. And to prove it, here's your Christmas present, Barney. Thanks, Betty. And here's your present. Oh, thank you, Barney. Mwah! And here's your present, Fred. Merry Christmas. Oh, thanks, Wilma. And here's, uh, here's, uh.. [mumbling] [chiming] "To Wilma, from Fred." Why, Fred! What a clever way to give me my present. [laughs] 'I almost thought you'd forgotten.' He he, why, Wilma, me forget? Ho ho ho. Oh, I hope it's those saber tooth earrings I've had my eye on. - Oh, look, Betty, it is. - Oh, how beautiful, Wilma. Oh, thank you, Fred. Mwah! 'I love them.' Don't thank me, Wilma. Thank Santa. [sleigh bells jingling] - Mommy. - Daddy. - It's Santa Claus. - It's Santa Claus. It's Santa Claus and his reindeer. And he's flying away in the sky. [laughs] Isn't it wonderful the imagination these kids have? - Bye-bye, Santa. - Bye-bye, Santa. - Goodbye, Santa. - Bye. See you next year, Santa. [chuckles] Talk about kids, Wilma. [laughs] Well, you two certainly have the Christmas spirit. - We sure do, Wilma. - We sure do. Ha ha ha. (Santa) Merry Christmas, everyone! Merry Christmas. 'Merry Christmas to all!'
