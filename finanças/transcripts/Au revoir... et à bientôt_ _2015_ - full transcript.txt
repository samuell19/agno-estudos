GOOD-BYE... SEE YOU SOON! What am I doing here? Mr Duvallois? Mr Duvallois, open up. I know you're there. Come on. We have to go. You're not even dressed. Come on. You don't want to be late, do you? - Your class starts in 3 min. - Dr. Blanchot... No, no, no. Positive attitude. Smile. There you go. Now get dressed. Come on! I'll wait in the hall. Come on. Hurry up. Your class starts in 30 seconds. Are all doctors here slave-drivers or am I particularly lucky? You're lucky to get me. I'm conscientious. I told your daughter I'd take care of you. - My daughter? - She's such a dear. Serious, committed. If only all our spa guests were like her. OK, Mr Duvallois. Don't forget... "Positive attitude." You've been saying it for 3 days. It's finally sinking in. Not that way, Mr Duvallois. This way. Yes. Go on. I'm watching you. There. See you later! Down, up. Down, breathe out. Up, breathe in. Listen to your body! Be in sync with it. Keep going. Everyone's got the move down, so let's speed up. Let's go! Speed it up. Down, and up. Faster! Good job, Mrs Lenoir. Perfect. You're progressing daily. Mr Duvallois, push harder. Try. Push all the way down. Yes, it's me. What's going on? You stuck me with a babysitter? I'm not 5 years old. - What are you talking about? - Come on? Dr. Blanchot, stuck to me like glue. - Ring any bells? - Easy, Dad, your nerves. Enough about my nerves. They're fine. It's my stomach! Three green beans a day! You're lucky. You have kids who care about you. I'm sending my kids to Social Services. Bye. How can I help you, Mr Marchal? He has a fever. At least, I think so. I wanted you to check. OK. Let's have a look. I've been waiting for you for 10 minutes. Here I am. Go ahead. I asked for a full-body massage. Yes... Right away. Harder. Harder, harder. Yes... Lower. Lower, lower, lower. No... Lower. Yes. Sure. Harder. Oh, yes... Oh, yes! That's good. Yes. Lower. Hello. - What are you doing here? - It was a misunderstanding. You'll laugh. I was hiding, and this lady... What are you doing here? Get out, sicko! Pervert! - I can explain. - Who is that guy? You seem pretty tense. Madam, calm down. Getting upset won't help. Are you kidding? You want me to calm down? I was felt up by one of your guests, and I should calm down? Do you have his name, or his room number? No, he didn't leave his card. - In that case... - He shouldn't be hard to find. He was a normal-looking man, gray hair, unshaven... He said he was hiding. Henri Duvallois. What's his room number? - 508. - Thank you. Hello? Excuse me. Could you do me a favor? My husband is showering. I left my key in the room. - I need to use the bathroom. - Sure. Thank you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Thanks for the massage Oh, no! Oh, my scarf! Shit! Sir, calm down. Getting upset solves nothing. Are you kidding? What'll I do now? Can't go to lunch naked, can I? That would be inappropriate. Could you take me to a store so I can buy some clothes? Of course. But it's Sunday. Everything is closed. Here's the check for table 5. Oh, excuse me, sir. Go right ahead, why don't you! - May I? - No! - I'll explain our misunderstanding? - "Misunderstanding?" I had no choice. I was being followed. - "Followed," really! - By a woman. Your wife? No. I've been a widower for 15 years. You're a widower, so women follow you around. Not all women. I said, "a woman." A horrible woman. You're a widower. An awful woman after you, so you go massage a stranger's buttocks? Technically, she's the one who requested the massage. - I just obeyed. - "Technically speaking." So if I asked you to jump out the window, would you do it, technically speaking? Right away. Interesting. I'm really sorry. Can you forgive me? OK. We're even. - Thank you. - I'll dine here. Very well, sir. Thank you. So... - "Lace of green beans." - I highly recommend it. - "Low-calorie peas?" - Hard to digest. Lace of green beans. Watch the portion size. I couldn't finish it all yesterday. - Is she who you're hiding from? - No. We have a class together. You move around in the water, dancing the rumba. Ridiculous. It's a waste of time? Why are you here? Apparently my nerves are shot. How about you? A change of pace. So it's no use asking who you are, where you're from... - No use. - Very well. And you? Who are you? Where are you from? What do you do? If I told you I was a spy, I'd have to kill you. I have to hang on 2 more days. It won't be easy. You've no idea how much you can do in 2 days. Do not disturb I feel like she's watching us. There. Not anymore. I have a present for you. Wait until I leave to open it. Thank you. I have nothing to give you. Yes, you do. You've already given me 2 wonderful days. Whose car is that? Didn't have time to tell you. He arrived without warning. But it's good news. Very good news. I've been talking to him for weeks. I didn't want to tell you until we were sure. Richard. Henri. The good news is that Grandfather agreed to sell us his land at a very good price. Where's Furie? Furie! Who's Furie? His dog. She ran away 3 days ago. But she'll come back. Yes, she'll come back. Charpentier made me an offer for my land. I can't stand him. Worst mayor we've ever had. Have you seen his car? But Charpentier is right: I'm too old to keep at it. Since I've no heir... I have to sell. They aren't your grandkids? I'm still your son-in-law? My daughter deserved better. Charpentier would've been better. You haven't spoken in 15 years. - Try to be nice. - Oh! Stay out of it. You lost my dog and brought this pest home. Shit! "Pest?" I don't know what's with him. Well, guess what this pest has to say. Guess! You're doing better. You look good. Over here, girl. Yes. Look, girl. Look who's here. - Who's here? - Hi, you naughty girl! My naughty girl! You ran away again! What did I do to you? She's afraid now. It's amazing. When I leave the farm, she goes to your house. What did you do? She knows she'll always be welcome. That must be it. Dogs are often more intelligent than men. Did your visit to the spa do you good? Me, maybe. But definitely not the farm. Ah, the farmers who can't leave their farm. When my husband was around, I heard it every day. Don't look so sad. I heard you ordered a new toy. Aren't you happy? At least you smile's back. Excuse me. Yes? Ah, Dr. Blanchot! Thanks for calling back. I wanted to know how his visit went. - Any problems? - Honestly, I'm very disappointed. You have to watch him all the time. He's never happy. He's always like that. Before he left, he stole the painting in his room. And his room was in such a state! Your father didn't try at all. Not at all. Especially the last 3 days. What happened? He didn't answer the door. He stayed in his room. Why? It's a symptom of depression. OK. Thank you. - How can I help you, Mr Marchal? - Chipo. She's a little feverish. I think she has a fever. At least... OK. Let's have a look. It was easier back in our day, eh? Yes. We said what we thought, thought what we said. Men acted like men, with all their flaws, of course, but virtues too, right? And women acted like women. I don't follow you at all. You know, since Marianne died, I haven't really been with anybody. I know. But it's been 15 years now. Yes, but during my 15 years of marriage, I had no reason to be interested in another woman. I know. Now I'm 35 years behind. I don't know how to act when it's serious. What you should say and do, when, what she wants, doesn't want... I'm lost. Since our 1st kiss at age 10, the basics haven't changed. You just have to be honest and sincere. - You think so? - Yes. Talk. Open your heart. Say what you think. I'm sure it'll be well received. What do you want to say? I want to say that... I want to say... I'm too old for this stuff. OK, Jeanne! Thanks for the coffee. See you later. See you later. What are you doing here? I wanted to tell you I spoke with Dr. Blanchot. - The leech. - She's worried about you. She thinks you should see someone. What? I'm fine, I promise. Really? And what's this? None of your business. Enough. I'm not leaving until you explain yourself. I'll explain. Go ahead. I'm listening. It's a painting... that I found in an antique store. I bought it. - You bought it? - Yes. Because I found it... beautiful. - Beautiful? - Yes. Look at it. It's beautiful. That face... That wrinkled face, piercing eyes... looking at us. Looking at me. Are you kidding me? You stole it from your spa room. I know what happened. Stop lying. What's going on with you? What's going on? I'm an adult. I owe you no explanation, and you shouldn't be in my room. Get out! What? Fancy a massage? 06 78 77 51 23 I got the scarf. It's beautiful. Thank you. I wanted to see you too, but I didn't dare call. I thought... It's all I can think about. I've never seen Dad dance before. He's not well. Not well at all. I want you to watch him 24 hours a day. He could have an accident otherwise. - OK. - And you, get off your butt. No. I'm having a teen crisis. I'm not listening. Is he whistling now? Dad, whistling? That's not normal. It's about Dad. - I know. - You do? Yes. - Is it that obvious? - Yes. What'll we do with him? He won't listen. He should see a specialist. A specialist? It's not that bad. It happens to lots of people. It does? Yes. You just have to convince him to take the next step. - He has to agree. - Help him. Encourage him. I've wanted this for years. For years? That's not very nice. What? I'm still a beautiful woman. I'm smart. I'm funny. What are you talking about? - Dad is not in his right mind. - Nonsense. He's in love. He's scared to take the plunge. You have to help him. I must intimidate him. Dad, in love? No. Yes. He told me so. Not explicitely, but he did. Alain, I'm busy. - Dad's at the station with a woman. A what? A woman. High heels, leopard print... A leopard woman? He's embracing her. He's kissing her. - Yes. On the mouth. - Why? Elodie, what do I do? Nothing. Come home right now. No, no. Not that one. That car is the Mayor Charpentier's, the show-off. Mine is over there. Come on. Is something up with Henri? Nothing. Nothing at all. I'm so happy you came. Me too. I love the countryside. Ah! That makes me happy. The land, the quiet, the little birds. All the wide-open spaces! Oh, yes! Everything you see belongs to me. Really? You're a real squire! With a country house surrounding domains. It's not exactly a country house in the Parisian sense. But it's not bad. We're almost there. Oh... You're a... You're a farmer? Yes. Today we say "agronomist," but I'm a farmer, yes. You're not at the office? I took the day off. - Are you going to introduce us? - Yes, of course. This is Lila. Elodie, my oldest daughter. Nice to meet you. She's a veterinarian. Alain, my son, who works with me. And this young beauty is Julie, Alain's daughter. And this is Jeanne, our neighbor and my childhood friend. She's like a sister to me. Right, Jeanne? Hello. And Furie. Where's Furie? Come here, girl! There you are! I don't know what you did. She's taken to you right away. - She got dirt all over me. - It's mud. It doesn't stain. You... You didn't tell me about all this. We didn't talk much about our lives. You didn't really think I was a British spy, did you? No, no. But in your room, there were lots of economic newspapers and your computer was always on the stock market, so I thought... - What? - I... I thought you were a trader or something like that. The price of canola and wheat is very important for us. Yes, of course. You know, it is the 21st century, even in the countryside. Here we are. Come in. So, I'm a farmer. A simple farmer. Are you disappointed? No, no. Not at all. I also like the simple things, no frills. - If you want, I have a guest room. - No, stop it. Are you kidding? OK. My name is Henri Duvallois. I'm a widow. I have 2 children. I'm a farmer. And I also like things that are simple, sincere and healthy. Is that OK? Lila Garfin, no children, single and... I'm a good fashion designer. - Perfect. A woman in leopard print has no scruples. She's a gold-digger. You'll see. She'll steal everything from you. She seemed nice to me. "Nice..." Mrs Fargeot was nice too. Then she stole from her husband and went to Paris. Like Mathilde. A woman in leopard is a woman who cheats. But it's not my father, or my farm. But let me tell you, she won't leave you anything. Well, good luck, kids. - I don't want to lose the farm. - Maybe that's not why she's here. Then why is she here? - What do you think, Elodie? - We don't know this woman. We don't know where she's from. I don't know what she sees in Dad, other than money. Good for Grandpa. We have to find out more about her. You have to diversify, so you reduce the risks. In bad years, if the price of canola falls, we can make up for it with wheat or cattle. You see? That way, we're more competitive. - It's huge. - No. It's not big enough. We need 100, 150 more hectares. Then we'd be in business. - I meant the tractor. - Yes. It's pretty big. Actually, I ordered another one. It's really something. It's a harvester. - Can we go for a ride? - It's not the harvest season. Come on. It'll be fun. Come on! - If you want. You think it's fun? - Yes! Oh, it's great! It's a whole room! - Yes. - Will it hold me? - Yes. It's sturdy. - It's great! It's great! I love it. If they see me driving it in winter, they'll think I'm crazy. Just tell them it was to please a Parisian. Then they'll really think I've lost my mind. - Alain. - This is not good. - What if we get caught? - Shut up and look. What? Stay focused. You're funny. I don't know what we're looking for. Anything that could tell us who she really is. Exactly. Underwear supposedly says a lot about a person. It's like astrology. But I don't believe that. Mathilde would never have worn this. - And she still left me. - Drop those panties and come see. "The scam artist" What is it? An article about an Argentinean scam ring. - Who would cut out such an article? - Yes! Who? Alain, "Who?" A scam artist herself. She has to go. Well, this is appetizing. You'll see. Elodie is an excellent cook. A master chef. Do you all live here? I mean, under the same roof? No. I have an apartment above my office. I just come over for dinner. Every night? So you're single? If no one took care of my father and brother, it'd be a disaster. They're a real ball and chain. They can't take care of themselves. - Don't listen. She's joking. - Really? Other than eggs and frozen dinners, what do you cook? I love to cook. What a good match! But I'm vegetarian. You're vegetarian? But do you eat meat? Well... No. - How about some wine? - Yes. Red. I'll get something good. I wanted to tell you, we're very happy you're here. Yes. It's true. That's very nice. I'm very happy to be here. Your father is wonderful. Dad, "wonderful?" If you need anything, just ask. We know Dad can be a bit difficult. He needs a lot of attention and isn't always easy going. Really? He seems charming to me. Really? "Charming?" Well, good for you. I'm happy he's found someone. It'll take the pressure off me. Excuse me. With animals, it's 24/7, 365 days a year. And all year-round. Same as the farm. That'll be new for you. We're in for a treat. Too bad. I have to go. - OK. Let me know how it goes? - Sure. Have a good night. - What were you talking about? - You. Your children are nice. They're very, very welcoming. Yes, they're very nice. You'll see. Do you think we can work? Really? Why not? It's going pretty well so far. Someone's calling late. Yes, Elodie. Oh, shit! How many are sick? OK. I'm coming. There's an emergency: the cows. I have to go. It's the 1st time someone's left me for a fat cow, but... Go ahead. I'll be back. I hope so. Shut up, cats! Have you seen her in person? And? Is she as beautiful as in the picture? Impressive? I see. When does she get here? It's a long trip. Are the papers in order? Is everything taken care of? When she gets here, she'll change my life. Laugh all you want. I've fallen in love. You can't order that in the mail. No. I really need her. But I have something in the meantime. I'll call you back tonight. - What time is it? - 6:00. - In the morning? - Yes. Who was that on the phone? Oh, that? No one. I have to go back and check on the cows. - Would you like to come with me? - Yeah, yeah. Sure. Can you give me 5 minutes to get ready? Sure. I'll go downstairs and make some coffee. Thank you. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Is Henri here? - No. He left. Oh. Already? Could you take me? No. I'm not with the cows today. But we have a car you can use. - Can I have some coffee? - It's over there. Thank you. - Should I help myself? - Yes. The cups are over there. Thank you. What? You're going to see the cows in those? - Why? They won't work? - Not for the cows. You'll see. It's very easy. You go straight for 3 km. Then, you'll see, there's nothing. Then you turn left. There's a tree. Further down, there's a fence. Inside the fence, there are cows. - You can't miss them. - OK. - Nothing? - Nothing, then left. Nothing, then left. Thank you. Hello, Elodie? I did everything you told me. She took the car. I took her phone, too. This isn't right, what we're doing. It's not nice. What did he say? "Nothing, then left." Well, there's nothing on the left. There's nothing anywhere. The 4 other cows are doing better. No illness. They must've eaten something bad. Check the food supplements and notify the supplier. OK. I'll know more after I get the stool sample results. Dad, what is it? I haven't heard from Lila. She was supposed to meet us. OK. We'll handle it. Keep an eye on them. I'll call you from the office. No! No! What's happening? Shit! Shit! This can't be happening! I don't believe it. My phone! Where's my phone? This can't be. My phone! I don't believe it. Oh, this can't be... This is a nightmare! This can't be! It's all over me! This can't be! I hate the countryside! I'm freezing. Son of a bitch! Lila? I'm so cold. I'm going to die. I'm going to die in the middle of the countryside. Where are you going? I'm trying to find Lila. She's gone. Please! Please! Sir! Wait! Can you take me to the Duvallois' farm? I don't understand. The chickens? Thank you. Where were you? I looked for you everywhere. Did you go back to sleep? The coffee must've been cold. What are you doing? Are you leaving? Yes. I'm not welcome in this house. - Why do you say that? - Oh, enough already. Your son sending me to Timbuktu, a car that just happens to break down, and my phone going missing... It's more than a coincidence. I don't understand. Your phone was under the bed. Here it is. Why did I come here? What did we think would happen? All I know is that I'm happy you're here. I'm happy with you. I want to spend time together. You call this "spending time together?" That bodes well. You're not that into it. It's obvious. I just had a problem with the cows. The cows, the chickens... They're easy to blame around here. What do you want me to do? Henri, look at yourself. Look at me. You and me, we were a fling. A nice fling. It ends here. If that's how you see things, that's that, then. - Can I take you to the station? - I'll call a taxi. I'm sorry about everything that happened. It was Aunt Elodie. She's way paranoid. She's convinced you're here to swindle Grandpa. To do what? To swindle him? Did she get dropped on her head? I don't need to swindle people. I work. I work in fashion. Fashion? That's cool. It's like the countryside. It only looks cool. Anyway, Elodie is not the problem. None of you think I could handle living here. Right? Isn't that it? All I know is that... My mom was from the city. After 7 years with my dad, she left and went halfway across the world. OK, but you can't generalize based on one person. - Honestly, I think you're cool. - Well, I am cool. It's your 3rd one, Henri. Are you sure... Oh, Henri! We missed you at the town council meeting. We haven't seen you in 3 weeks. Can you pour me one? Leave me alone, Charpentier. Well, "missed" is a manner of speaking. Because when the opposition isn't there, it's easier. Do me a favor, Stéphane. Go bother someone else. Maybe you have better things to do. A girlfriend, is that it? A real looker, I've heard. Is she French? Ukrainian? Apparently there are tons of Ukrainians, on the Internet, who will do anything to leave their country. You know who came to visit me? Your father-in-law. I think I'll have better luck with his land than his daughter. He wasn't happy you brought that little Russian whore here. It didn't honor the memory of his darling little girl. Oh! That's enough! Go home! You've done enough for one night! Go! Go home! Get out of here! You shouldn't have done that, Grandpa. Why? Everyone hated it. But you liked it, didn't you? If you did, you shouldn't care what other people think. - How old are you now? - No one's noticed, but I'm 16. Did you love her? What a question! Are you in love with her or... or was it just like people in the village are saying, a fling? It wasn't a fling. Does she know that? Did you tell her? When the cows got sick, I didn't have time to see her. Stop complaining. You sound like Dad. If you love her, fight for her. Start by telling her. - Are you sure you're just 16? - Go see her. Talk to her. I don't even know where she lives. If I call her, she won't answer. I don't know where she lives, but I know where she works. Will you excuse me for a minute? I won't be long. Is Dad there? He's not answering the phone. He just left. I think he'll be gone a few days. Where did he go? To look for Lila. Oh, no! I don't believe it! OK. What's wrong with this macaw? I think he's been losing a lot of feathers. - Losing his feathers? - Yes... He still has some left. - Hello. - Hello, sir. Hello. I'm here to see Lila Garfin. I'm... Great! She's been expecting you. Please, come in. I'm Erica, Lila's assistant. This is Anne, our financial director. It's a pleasure to meet you. Emmanuel, our shop manager. I'm so happy you could make it. - We didn't think you'd come. - Yes. Astrid. We're so happy to see you. It means so much to Lila. That's our marketing and development director. I have to introduce you to... Uh... introduce you to... He's a genius with patterns. She's exaggerating. Nice to meet you. You know, Lila's happiness depends on you. - He's perfect. - Are you coming? - Yes. Wait here 5 minutes, while I tell Lila you're here. Have a seat. Would you like something to drink? - Champagne? - At this hour? No, no. OK, champagne. Shit! Not bad, huh? Excuse me. François Roussel is in your office. Everything's fine. He's wearing one of our scarves. Isn't it great? Great. Did you look at my sketches? Yes. You're way off the mark, but I fixed them. Will you take a look? I need a signature. It's urgent. Come here. What's he doing? Wait. Excuse me. Wait, Anne. Excuse me. I'll finish it later. Can you come back? Thank you. What are you doing here? Why did you come here? I'm attached. I can't break free. Listen, Henri, we already talked about this. You and I are too different. Lila, I'm really attached. I don't believe it. - I don't believe it. - Do you have the key? Why did you come here? Please, give me the key. Answer me first. I came because, since you left, I can't eat, I can't sleep, I don't know what to do. I'm withering away without you. When you're there, I feel like I'm alive again. That's very nice, but who was the girl you were waiting so impatiently for? What girl? Stop it! Don't pretend you don't know. Your phone call, the other day, at 6am. Your new love. It's not a girl. It's a new piece of farm equipment. They're behind on the delivery. Don't treat me like a fool. Lila, I swear, I was joking on the phone. In all these years, I haven't been with many women, and none of them made me feel the way you did. None of them. There were none I wanted to follow the way I want to follow you. I know we're worlds apart. We're so different, but... I don't want to lose you. I know we can work. - Farm equipment, huh? - Honestly, an atomic bomb. That's why... You see. Will you give me the key? - Excuse me. We have a problem. - What? I just spoke to François Roussel on the phone. The real one. - He's not coming today. - OK. And Roberto already started the shoot. That's for tomorrow! He's going to New York tomorrow. He wanted to take the Concorde. - That hasn't flown for years. - He's mad as hell about it. Higher. Lower. Stop! Higher. Stop. A little lower. Think about making love. Make love to the camera. Make love. Give it to me! Give it to me! Is this your first shoot? It can be surprising if you're not used to it. What an idiot! What's he talking about? Smile. The hair. Be a woman. Roberto is one of the nicer ones. They're artists. They're under a lot of pressure. You have to give it to me. You're giving me nothing. Give me your high-paid ass! You have to give it to me. Don't look. I'm the one who looks. Higher. I'm not a midget! It's shit. I'm asking you to pose, that's it. This girl's decided to ruin my day. "I..." nothing! I'm just asking you to pose. You look like spaghetti sauce. It's impossible. That dress is shit! It doesn't catch the light. It looks like a potato sack. No, Roberto, the dress is great. You're doing a great job. Everything is fine. You want to teach me to do my job? Who are you? That dress is shit! Calm down, Mr Artist! It's fine, Henri. Everything is fine. It's nothing. - What's this thing? - This thing will knock you out if you can't speak nice to ladies. - Henri, it's fine. It's the stress. Is he John Wayne? Uh... Everything is fine. What? I'm the one who's ridiculous here? No. That won't work. Makeup! Hair! Touch-up! We have to do it all over. - Surprise. - What are you doing here? I heard the shoot was happening. I wanted to be here with you. Wait. Not here. Not in front of everyone. We don't need to hide anymore. It's over with Hélène. - Who's that? - Charles Montagnac. Director of the Marsac Group. I broke up with Hélène. He owns 51% of Lila's company. And he's been her lover for the last 2 years. - Stop it, please. - What? - Not here. - This is my company. I need a few days to sort things out. - Please, leave me alone. - Are you kidding me? You're the one who came back to me, who said we were made for each other, weren't you? - Was that all a joke? - Yes. - Yes? - No. It wasn't a joke. It's just... I'll explain later. Please, it's not a good time. Out of the way, workers! Out of the way! Please leave. Don't stay here. Don't stay here? I'll leave then. Did you cut your hair? Without telling me? What an idiot! - Can I call you a taxi? - There's no need. Are you leaving already? Who was that guy? It's... It's complicated. It's... He's the one I was trying to get away from when we met. We broke up, but now... It's complicated. If it's complicated with him, what does that say about us? Were you looking for a country house for weekend getaways? - Henri, please. - It's fine. Lila, you're right. What we had was a great fling, but it can't work. So, good-bye. Please, Henri. Wait. Let me explain. You stay in your world, I'll go back to mine, and everything'll be fine. It's fine. Furie! Here, Furie! Over here! Here, Furie! Furie! Here. Here, girl. Come on. Come here, Furie. A good meal: a man doesn't need anything else to be happy. - Right, Henri? - Well, I'm glad you're happy. You ate well. You drank my whisky, you drank my wine. You smoked my cigars. So how about we get down to what you came to discuss? My land. The sale. Yes, your land. Did you really offer it to that asshole Charpentier? Yes, but as long as nothing's been signed, nothing is final. Answer my question about women. - I don't see the connection. - I do. Marrying my daughter without my consent was one thing. Handing you my land while you tarnish her memory with the 1st Parisian you find is quite another. You haven't changed. You want to decide who I can or can't see. You haven't changed. Come on, make peace. It's a deal. - Did you see how I calmed him down? - What? Grandfather. What, "Grandfather?" Oh, when there are cookies, then you remember me! You don't want to keep her? I don't know what's gotten into her. She's always over at your place. It gives us a chance to chat a bit. It doesn't happen that often, especially with your family there. What do you think my husband and your wife would say, if they could talk to us from up there? I don't know. I don't think Marianne liked you much. I don't know why. - She was afraid of me. - Afraid of you? Why? - Don't you see? - No. - Really? - No. She knew I had feelings for you and that I wanted you back. - Isn't that something! - Don't tell me you didn't know. - Yes. Yes, yes. - Henri... We were meant to be together ever since we were little. I never should've married Eric, or you Marianne. I love you, Henri. I love you, and I want you all to myself. I want you to myself, Henri. Jeanne. Whenever you want to talk to someone, you come to me. I'm the only one who listens. You love me, Henri. You love me, but you won't admit it. Even your dog knows you love me. Look. She knows my house is her house. - Yes, yes, yes... - Henri. Yes, yes... But no. No, Jeanne. No, Jeanne. Come on, Jeanne. Come on. Jeanne, you're my childhood friend. You're like a sister. I never thought of... - Like what? - Like... - Like a desirable woman? - Yes. Jeanne, come on! You're something. Come on, it's no big deal. OK. Should I leave you the dog? Yeah. The dog... Scandal in haute couture. Lila Garfin, the founder of Création Elle, has just been fired by the Marsac Group. The reason: a complaint for stealing designs lodged by Erica Lamarche, her assistant. The Marsac Group's reaction shows the accusation is serious and undoubtedly true. Shouldn't we tell him? Why? To rub salt in his wounds? To bring the Parisian back? No. If she comes back, Grandfather won't sell us his land. OK, but what about Dad? He's moved on. There's no use dragging him back into it. - You want to keep it to yourselves. - Right. We won't tell him anything. - Dad, do you have anything to say? - I think that... He thinks what I think. Case closed. What case is closed? Nothing. Something that has nothing to do with... We have something to show you. Henri! Where are you going? I was going to go get you. Come on. I didn't steal from anyone. And certainly not from Erica. And she's a terrible designer. So where did these accusations come from? Charles's wife. She's the big boss. She runs the Marsac Group. So when she found out us... Why don't you tell the press? - You could tell them the truth. - Because it's no use. The Marsac Group owns 51% of my company. And I'm fired. The last few days have been hard. I felt like I'd lost everything. Then I wondered what I'd lost. I have no husband, no kids. My job is my life. I always put it first. And what happened? I was betrayed by the people I sacrificed everything for. I messed practically everything up. I'm here now. I'm glad you came back. Is this a joke, Dad? No, it's not a joke. She's a pure Parisian. She'll never last. Dad, it didn't take long for Mathilde... We're tired of hearing about your ex! Lila has nothing to do with Mathilde. Grandfather was clear. If she's here, he won't sell. Never. He can't tell me what to do. No one can. Listen, you're right. I'm from the city, and... I'm out of my element here. I'm scared of animals, and I get hay fever. I know nothing about farming. That's all true, but I'm willing and ready to learn. And I want to be useful, and be with you. Really? What do you want to do, specifically? You can't do anything on the farm. I can't do this. You can't just stand there behind me. It's stressful. I feel like you're judging me. That I'm judging you? Not at all. Fine. If you've nothing to do, can you help me? Oh, no! I don't want to help you. I want everything to be perfect. Don't worry. Everything will be fine. Mathilde cooked for me, too, in the beginning. Dad! I didn't mean anything by it. Here. You know what? Tonight, let's all change. We're going to look nice. OK? This looks nice. You couldn't find anything nicer to wear? No. How about you? No, no, no! No TV tonight. What do you mean, "no TV?" Not the news? No. Let's try to have a nice evening. Let's try to talk, like a real family. Talk? What'll we talk about? Lots of things. You don't usually talk? Well, no. I don't have anything to say. I'm sure you do. I'll be right back. She's great, isn't she? The TV thing was a bit much. Stop it. Here you go. I made you one of my specialties: beef stew. You see, Dad. There's meat. No, it's my version. It's vegetarian. - No beef? What's in it then? - Stew. Will you serve us, Alain? No meat, no TV, and now I have to serve everyone. Be careful with your costume. We're in for a treat. It smells good. That goes in the bedroom, upstairs. That goes in the studio, by the bedroom. - Those are... - Books. In the bedroom, upstairs. OK, go ahead. Give it to me. Grab it from below. Careful! See that, Furie? It's fancy. Be very careful. They're Janouchkys. - Janouche-whats? - Chkys. - What are they for? - Nothing. They're art. "Nothing will change." We'll see. Are we almost there? - Where are we going? - Trust me. Here we are. Hang on. Here it is! Oh, wow! She's beautiful. Oh, my! So this is my rival? Yes. I couldn't resist. I see. I can't compete. She looks good. Well, I don't fall in love with just anyone. With her, we'll work 2 or 3 times faster, which we'll have to do, if we get Richard's land. - Who's Richard? - My father-in-law. He's ready to sell us his land. Then we'll really be competitive. I'd like to meet your father-in-law. That's not a good idea. He's disturbed. Want to go for a ride? I thought it wasn't the season. Let's go crazy! I'm here. Dr. Duvallois, I... Grandfather? What are you doing here? Don't call me that. I hate it. Are you going to let me in or leave me here to rot? Excuse me. I'll be right back. Come in. Give me a break. So it appears you've all adopted the Parisian. She's fine, Grandfather. I swear. She's really trying, and she makes Dad happy. So it's true. She's living with you all? Not for long. Just for a few days. Are you lying to me? La Buisson saw a moving truck with Paris plates. It unloaded everything. What was that? La Buisson always exaggerates. No, no. It's temporary. She's not going to stay. She just needed a change of scene. Change of pace? The country air is good for what she has, poor thing. Why? What does she have? She's tired. She's depressive. She's on the verge of a breakdown. Life in Paris is not easy. - People break down. - Of course. She's doing bad, bad, bad. No, hang on. What kind of illness does she have, exactly? She has a disorder. A bipolar disorder. She doesn't know where she is. She's lost all her bearings. Is she a little crazy, sometimes? Yes! You could say that, yes. Oh, wow... It's no coincidence Dad met her at the spa. You know, "hello" leads to "how are you"... But she's here to rest. - That's it. - That's it. So for the sale, are we... As soon as the papers are ready. OK. That's good. But what I told you about her depression, breakdown, craziness, etc., that stays between us. You know me. I'll take it to the grave. - OK. OK, OK. - All right... It's beautiful. You don't miss life in Paris, the fashion shows? No. Not at all? Not at all. Not at all, at all? I'm going crazy. At night, I dream of steaks. Big, juicy steaks looking at me, taunting me. When I try to catch them, they disappear. Quit it. - She's a good cook. - Yeah, but I need meat. And the TV! No more TV. Are we being punished? I saw old man Richard. I had to lie to him so he'd sell. What did you do? I told him she was manic-depressive. - What? - I had to improvise. Don't tell Dad, OK? Old man Richard told me he'll keep quiet. You're back at it. I knew it. - You couldn't help yourself. - It has nothing to do with that. What is it? Who's it for? None of your business. For me? None of your business! Leave me alone. You're distracting me. Let me see. Turn around. - It's great. - It's too nice for me. "Too nice for me." What does that mean? You can't be pretty? Look at me. You can top it off with a little makeup. - There. You'll be beautiful. - Really? Enjoy. Have fun. Be pretty. Come on, come on, come on! - They don't look good. - It's a team of vegetarians! - Dad. - Yes, dear. Dad, look. Did you see? - What's that? - Lila made it. The girls at school will go wild. You think you're going to school dressed like that? Dressed like what? Like... I don't know. Go ahead, say it. Like what? Well, like... - Like a woman. - I am a woman. You couldn't say, "You look pretty, honey?" Sweetie, you're not a woman. You're my little girl. And you don't need all that. You're fine the way you are. If you go out like that in town, I'll be ashamed. You, you, you. What about me? - Julie... - I can do what I want. I'm 16. I should be thinking about being pretty, having fun. I like this dress. You can't do whatever you want. Go change. - I'm your father. Go change! - I can't believe this! You've never acted like a father. Oh! Richard. To what do I owe the pleasure? - We need to talk. And the 1st time you do, you're a pain in the ass. Well done. Julie! Hypomanic episode with psychophysical hyperactivity. What are you talking about? Come in. Are those your passport photos? - What do you want? - To apologize. You, apologize? That would be a 1st in 40 years. Why's he circling like a chicken with its head cut off? Julie was never like this before. Lila infected her. I've read a lot about bipolar disorder. It's hard being crazy, but it's not contagious. What are you talking about? If I'd known, I never would've made the dress. It's not you. It's me. I'm so stupid. I'm always being pushed around. Stop being down on yourself. OK? You're not stupid. - Julie! - Leave me alone! Since when do we lock our doors in this family? - Leave me alone, Dad. Julie, open up. Or... Or what? You'll break down the door and hit me? I'm sorry. I got scared. Seeing you dressed up reminded me of your mother. When she got sick of being in the country, she started dressing differently too. She changed her hair. And she left me. It wasn't because of the country, Dad. It was because of you. You're spineless. You don't know what you want. Mom didn't have a husband. And I need a real dad. Lila is not manic-depressive. Where did you get this nonsense? I know everything. Your Parisian is bipolar. Anyone home? She's a little crazy. - Who told you that? - Your daughter. Elodie? Why would she have said that? Elodie! What? Making me believe such nonsense! And using my granddaughter to trick me! How dare you! Richard, I'm telling you, it's a misunderstanding! You'll pay for it. And you know where you can stick my land? - I need a word with you! - Me? I didn't do anything. I just wanted to speed up the sale. It's his fault too! Leave me alone! I don't want to talk to you. - I forbid you from leaving! - What? Since when? Why did you tell Richard that Lila is depressive? - Why? - What? What did you do? I did what I've always done since Mom died. I'm trying to keep this family together. - You're not helping! - I want a happy family too. But look at us. A widower, a divorcee and an old maid. - That's what we are. - Oh! An old maid? That's what you'll become if you keep this up. That's horrible. Elodie, Elodie! What a temper. Everything's fine. Let me explain. It's no big deal. I'm sorry. I destroy everything I touch. Even your daughter is telling people I'm crazy. It's true that since you came, nothing has been the same. I'm a walking disaster. You could lose your farm because of me. Yes, I could. I should leave. It'd be better. Yes, perhaps. Uh... Before you leave, can I ask you a question? Will you marry me? Why? Because I love you. Why? Because you've brought life back into this house. What are you saying? Everything's gone to pieces. Exactly. We're not robots anymore. It's better this way. What about your farm? We'll see about the farm. My only wish is to be my wife's husband. I had an idea. There's... a little shop for sale, in town. You don't have to if you don't want to, but I thought the type of dress you made for Julie would be a hit. There aren't many designers around. You know, competition... You want to marry me, but I have to work? Yes. We're modern in the country. The woman works. - Yes. - "Yes," what? Yes, I want us to get married. Ah! All right then. Here. I'll butter us some bread. That'll lighten the mood. - You know what else I want? - No. To reconcile this family. That won't be easy. Hello. OK. I'll sit down, if you insist. So you're the famous Richard? Yes. Why? What did you expect? No. You're perfect. You're exactly as I imagined. Friendly and pleasant. Don't mock me. Are you the gold-digger come to destroy my family? Richard, we don't know each other, but you know what? You remind me of my grandfather. You're exactly like him. Surly, set in his ways, and grumpy. But deep down, he had a heart of gold. He loved his grandchildren. Don't try to win me over. Did you come here to talk to me about your granddad? No. About Henri. As the head of the family, Henri is pathetic. That's your opinion, but I think you don't really know each other. I wanted to talk to you about me. Me and the family we could be, if you'd have me. That's all I wanted to say. It was a pleasure to meet you, Richard. See you soon. - Thank you. - Have a nice evening. Good-bye. You look tired, honey. You're working too much. Are you lecturing me? The old maid isn't in the mood. No, no. That's not why I'm here. I came here to apologize. Apologize? For what? I think Lila is really good for me. Thanks to her, I realized... I haven't been a very good dad all these years, since your mom died. Since Alain was my successor, I put him to work right away, and you took care of everything, and was blind to all that. I don't think it made you very happy. And I regret that. Why didn't you ever tell me? Because I'm stubborn. A stubborn hick. What will we do about the farm? The farm's not important. What matters is us, that we're happy, together. Yeah. You're right. I can't talk right now. I'm with a patient. I'll call you back. Hope I'm not bothering you... Invite me to dinner so we can get this over with. - Would you... - Yes. Tonight at 8pm. Well... OK. Um... - Yes. - Very good. See you tonight. Here's your coffee. - Hi, gang. - Hello. - Mr Mayor. - How are you? Fine. Sale agreement, signed, and a big check ready for your bank account. What time we've wasted. Our land and our families should've united a long time ago. Are you talking about my daughter? She should've married me. It would've been easier. You wouldn't have made her laugh. What? I remember, my daughter loved to laugh. That's how it is, my friend. What's wrong with him? Let me talk, for once. You can't sell your land to Charpentier. He's a complete moron. He's the stupidest mayor in the Charente. If you sell to him, you'll look stupid too. That's the 1st thing. Second, if you don't like Dad, that's your problem. I don't care. But your daughter was our mother. You can't punish us. So here's what I propose. Don't sell your land to Dad. Sell it to your grandchildren. Then you won't look stupid. What do you say? I stunned him. I stunned the old man. Now he knows who he's dealing with. He looked at me, totally stunned, tore up the contract, and left. That's it. We got his land. Yes! I love you, Dad. There's only one thing left to do... - Give me the camera. - The camera? You forgot it in the car? You're such a pain! Hurry up before they get here. I have to do everything. And the rice? Where's the rice? Julie, you have the rice. Come over here. You're all asleep today. I have to do everything. It's fine. Don't stress out. - Here. - Julie. Who's that girl you were talking to? Céline? Lila's cousin. - Do you like her? - No! - I'll introduce you. - Stop it! - Come on. - Stop it! Céline, this is my dad, Alain. - Hello. Alain. - Nice to meet you. - He's single. - Stop it! You're the cousin from Paris? That's funny, because Mathilde... From Paris, in Paris? - Yes. - Yes, of course. So, you, and the countryside... It has its benefits. - Do you like the countryside? - I love the countryside. - Is the dog celebrating too? - Yes! She's coming to the party. I recognize her. That's Furie, Henri's dog. - Now she's mine. - Everything works out. You'll be alone with the dog. Did you see the married couple? You'll be jealous, eh? - Why would I be jealous? - I don't know. You could be. I'm not. I'm getting married soon. - To who? - Charpentier. Oh, the idiot? Yes, but the mayor. When you want something, you'll have to go through me. Oh, no... Have a nice time, Richard. Did you stop at the horse track? No, no. I can't do everything. I need help. Honey, breathe. I don't have time to breathe. I'll breathe later. There they are! Everyone gather for the picture, please. This way. - Very good. - Get closer. There. Ready? I'll take another one. Smile! Yes. Very good. You're very handsome, Dad. Perfect. What's that over there? That's our limousine. - Do you like it? - I love it! Nice, isn't it? Just married Just like I dreamed. Great! Can I get in? - Yes. Come on. Let's go. - Shall we get in? Oh, great! - Do you like it? - It's wonderful. - Can I drive? - No. No. - Not a good idea. - It's OK. I have my license. - No, Lila. Quit playing around. - Watch me. Stop! - Here we go! - No, not like that. Like this. Watch. You don't have to make the noise. There you go. - Is it like this every day? - Yes. - On Saturday nights, do you go out? - No. Saturday nights, we sleep. In bed at 9pm, up at 5 am. Every day. Subtitles: Eclair Media
