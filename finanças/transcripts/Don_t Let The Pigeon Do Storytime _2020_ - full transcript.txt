- Aah! Hmm. - Hey, Mo! Hey, Mo! - Oh, hi. - Hey, Mo. Hee hee hee hee! - Take care. Okay, bye. Hello! Wow! Hello! How you doing? Hello up there! Wow! Look at you guys! You look great! Wow. Hello! Welcome to the Kennedy Center. Unbelievable. Wow. My name is Mo Willems. And I... am a balloon salesman. - No! - No. All right. Try again. My name is Mo Willems. And I am a corporate attorney specializing in tax affairs. No! All right. Let's try one more time. My name is Mo Willems. And I... am an author/illustrator. Yes. And that is really cool, because that means I have something in common with you guys. Do you guys like to make up stories? Yeah! - Do you like to draw? - Yeah! Well, then you are author/illustrators just like me. Yeah. That's cool. The only difference between what you do and what I do is that you don't have to give a percentage to a woman named Marcia. Look, I'm so excited to be here today because you know what we're gonna do? We're gonna read stories. We're gonna sing songs. We're gonna draw. And we have this amazing cast of the Storytime All-Stars. Yeah. Amazing. So, kids, here's the thing about the Storytime All-Stars. They're very famous. They're very, very funny. But you really should have no idea who they are... ...or any familiarity with their work. Seriously, guys. Kids, if you recognize any of them, your parents are doing it wrong. But they're so nice and they are so funny, so let's pretend like we're excited that they're here, okay? Yeah. Right. Okay, here we go. Our extensive and wide-ranging music and special effects department... Mr. Fred Newman. Let's give a big "sure we know who you are" welcome to Tony Hale! What? You know what would be awesome? Discovering the comedy stylings of someone like Yvette Nicole Brown! Now, I know you didn't see him in that thing, because that thing was not G-rated at all. But how cool is it that we have Mr. Thomas Lennon? You know, I bet that somewhere out there, there's a funny person named Rachel Dratch! You know who sounds like they might be a nice person? Oscar Nu√±ez! A show like this would not be completely awesome if we didn't have Greta Lee! What? Greta Lee. One day when you're much, much older, you'll be a fan of Cameron Esposito! What's up? Now, what are the chances that someone you shouldn't have heard of but is a really big deal is here? Pretty good, if that someone is Anthony Anderson! - Make some noise! - There's more? There can't be unless it's Natalie Morales! The Storytime All-Stars! Oh, wow. What an amazing cast of total strangers. All right. You guys wanna hear a story? All right. Let's start with Leonardo, the Terrible... - No, no, no! - What? What? No, no, no. No, no. At rehearsal, we said we're doing Leonardo. - No, the Pigeon, Mo. - Right behind you. - I don't even... I don't... What? I don't see it. - There's a pigeon there, Mo! It's... Oh! Pigeon. What are you doing here? Scram. - I'll be back. - Your pal, Mo Willems, presents... - ...by me. - Leonardo was a terrible monster. - He couldn't scare anyone. - Aw! So cute. - He didn't have 1,642 teeth like Tony. - I have a lot of teeth, and I'm okay with that. Not all teeth shown. - He wasn't big like Eleanor. - Bbb! Bbb! Bbb! Bbb! Bbb! - It's a living. - Bbb! Bbb! Bbb! Bbb! - And he wasn't just plain weird, like Hector. - Flippy floppy floopy floopy pants. Abba zabba zow zinga! - Leonardo tried very hard to be scary. - I'm in a bag. - But he just wasn't. - Ahhh. - One day, Leonardo had an idea. He would find the most scaredy-cat kid in the whole world and scare the tuna salad out of him. - Tuna salad. - Leonardo researched. - Too passive. - Whish. - Too aggressive. - Whish. - Choose me or not, I don't care. - Too passive-aggressive. - Until he found the perfect candidate. - Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh. - Sam. - Leonardo snuck up on the poor, unsuspecting boy. - Sneak. Sneak. Sneaky-sneaky. Sneaky-sneaky-sneak. - And the monster gave it all he had. - Ahhhhhhh. - Until the little boy cried. - Ma-ma-ma waaaaaaaahh! - ...cheered Leonardo. - I did it. I finally scared the tuna salad out of someone. - No, you didn't... - ...snapped Sam. - Oh, yeah? - ...replied Leonardo. - Then why are you crying? - Ladies and gentlemen, Tony Hale. Tony Hale. - Then Leonardo made a very big decision. - Instead of being a terrible monster, he would become a wonderful friend. - It's okay. - Ah. - Ah! - But that didn't mean that he couldn't try and scare his friend every now and then. - Huh? - Aah! - I'm gonna get ya. I'm gonna get ya. I'm gonna get ya. - The end. - What a story! Whoo! - Hey. Hey, uh, Mo. I have a question that just occurred to me this very moment. - Oh. Okay, Rachel. - Okay. Is it K-nuffle Bunny or Nuffle Bunny? Right? I mean, everyone wants to know that, right? - That's a good question. Okay, so here's the answer. It all depends on how you pronounce it. No, actually, I pronounce it K-nuffle, because Knuffle is a Dutch word. It means "hug" or "snuggle." And my family is originally from Holland. - Oh. Okay. That makes sense. - Is Knuffle Bunny a true story? - Oh, that's a very good question, Oscar. - Thank you. - How many people in the audience think that Knuffle Bunny is a true story? Raise your hand. Oh. A lot. How many people think that I made up the story of Knuffle Bunny? Raise your hand. Oh, yeah. All right. All right. Here's the real answer. Everything in the Knuffle Bunny stories is true except for the parts that I made up. And that's the great thing about making up stories. You can start with something that's real and then just make stuff up and get away with it. Right? For instance, you can make up a story like this. You can make up a story called... Go a little like this. Today was an awesome day. I saw Mo Willems at the Kennedy Center. Mo was funny. - Yeah. - Mo was cool. - Yeah. - All right. - Mo was a snazzy dresser. And modest. - No. - No. - All right. But mostly Mo was wise. We estab... Okay. - While Mo was on stage in this particular story being really funny and cool and wise, his head popped off. - Pop. Whish. - Ouch. - That's okay, Anthony. It's okay. 'Cause he grew another one. And that one popped off. - Pop. Whish. - Ow. Ouch again. - No, no. No, it's okay again. Because he grew another one. That popped off. - Pop. Whish. - And another. - Pop. Whish. - And another. - Pop. Whish. - And another. And another. Until the whole Kennedy Center started filling up with Mo Willems's head. Luckily, I had my surfboard with me. So I jumped on top of the wave of Mo Willems's head. I burst out of the Kennedy Center, went all the way through Washington, D.C. until the Supreme Court building. The end. Are you guys ready to hear this kind of made-up, kind of true story? - Yeah! - All right. Here we go. Before we even begin, we see all these important pictures from this real, not-real family's life. - It's a man and a woman and they're getting married. - And here are the man and woman again, and it looks like they just had a baby. - That baby is crying. - And now the man and the woman are in front of a house. - And there's Trixie hugging her Knuffle Bunny. - ...by me. - Not so long ago before she could even speak words, Trixie went on an errand with her daddy. - Trixie and her daddy went down the block... - Uh-huh. - ...through the park... - Oh, yeah. - ...past the school... - ...and into the Laundromat. - Trixie helped her daddy put the laundry into the machine. - She even got to put the money into the machine. - Then they left. - But a block or so later... - ...Trixie realized something. - Trixie turned to her daddy and said... - Yeah. That's right. - Replied her daddy. - We're going home. - Said Trixie again. - Yeah. No, come on, please don't get fussy. - Said her daddy. - Well, she had no choice. Trixie bawled. - She went boneless. - She did everything she could to show how unhappy she was. - By the time they got home... - ...her daddy was unhappy, too. - As Trixie's mommy opened the door, she said, "Where's Knuffle Bunny?" - The whole family ran down the block. - It's okay. It's gonna be okay. - And they ran through the park. They zoomed past the school... - Everything's fine. - ...and into the Laundromat. Trixie's daddy looked for Knuffle Bunny and looked. - And looked. - And looked. - And looked. But Knuffle Bunny was nowhere to be found. - So Trixie's daddy decided to look harder. - Yes, he did. - Until... And those were the first words that Trixie ever said. - The end. Uh... - That dramatic story has inspired me to, uh, sing a dramatic song. A song of Trixie's heartache and pain. A song that needs to be sung... ...by me. This song is dedicated to all the stuffies out there. You know who you are, even if you don't know where you are. - Wow. Anthony, that was very, very... Beautiful is not the right word, but, yeah, it's pretty close. - Thank you. Thank you, Greta. - You know, we could also do it as a sing-along. - Oh, I love sing-alongs. - Oh, I love sing-alongs. - I love sing-alongs, and I have ears. - All right. Now, kids, if you can't read the words, don't worry. Just make them up. Mo did. - Yes. - Mm-hmm. - Big finish, everybody! - Thanks, everybody! You were great. - Amazing. - I'm ready for another story. - Yeah. An alphabet story. - Oh, well, you guys are in luck, because according to regulation ABC-15, everyone children's book author is required to produce at least one alphabet book in his or her career. And mine is entitled... - Ooh! That's me. That's me. - Rachel Dratch. You guys ready for a story? All right. Here we go. Creature, look. There's the alphabet. - Spoiler alert! - A! - Apples! - B! - Berries! - Ooh. - C! - Cereal! - Ahh! - D! - Doughnuts! - Ooh! Doughnut. Doughnut. Doughnut. Doughnut. Doughnut. Doughnut. Doughnut. Doughnut. - E! - Eggs. - F! - Furniture? - Ooh! Chippendale. - G! - Gravy. - H! - Huge hot-sauce halibut hoagie! - Ooh. So halibutty! - I! - Ice cream. - Ooh! Brain freeze! J! - Jacket. - Ooh! Ooh! Burberry flavored. - K! - Kilt. - Ooh! Commando! - L! - Lunch box. Ah! It's the least important meal of the day. - M! - Mayonnaise. - Ooh. - Oh. - Oh, that... that's disgusting. - Ahh! - N! - Napkin. - O! - Oohhhhhhhhhh! I don't feel so good. - P! - Potty! - Uh-huh. Hold it in. Hold it in. - Yep. - Q! - Queasy? - Quite. - Oh. - R. - Rice? - S. - Saltines? - Nibble. Nibble. Nibble. - T. - Tea? - U. - Ugh. - V. - Vomit. - W! - Water? X! - XO XO XO. Mwah. Mwah. Mwah. - Dad. - Y! - Yawn! - Z! - Zzzzonked. - Z end! - Let's hear it for Rachel Dratch. Mr. Fred Newman! All right. - We did that one by the letter. I'm a dad. I am someone's dad. I can say things like that. Would you like to hear one of my favorite books, featuring one of my favorite characters? Favorite character. All-time favorite character. - The Pigeon! - The what? - The pigeon! - The... What? No, no, no. It's a favorite book. Aah! - Get on with it already. Waiting is not easy. That's right. I was talking about "Waiting is not Easy!" starring Elephant and Piggie. One of my favorite books. - Aw, feathers! Aw. - Okay. You guys ready for a story? - Yeah! - Yes. - Oh. By me. - Gerald, I have a surprise for you. - Yay! What is it? - The surprise... is a surprise. - Oh. Is it big? - Yes. - Is it pretty? - Yes. - Can we share it? - Yes! - I cannot wait. - You will have to. - Wha... Wait. Why? - The surprise is not here yet. - So I will have to wait for it? - Yes. - Oh, well, if I have to wait, I will wait. I am waiting. Waiting is not easy. Piggie, I want to see your surprise now. - I'm sorry, Gerald, but we must wait. I am done waiting. I do not think your surprise is worth all this waiting. I will not wait anymore. Okay, I will wait some more. - It will be worth it. - Whoo! - Piggie! We have waited too long. It's getting dark. It is getting darker. Soon we will not be able to see each other. Soon we will not be able to see anything. We have wasted the whole day. - Well, um... - We have waited and waited and waited and waited. And for what? - For that. - This was worth the wait. - I know. - Tomorrow morning I want to show you the sunrise. - I cannot wait. - Zee end. - Ladies and gentlemen, a song from the "Elephant & Piggie" musical... "We Are in a Play." What I'm trying to say is that you're better than any toy. - Well, thank you, Piggie. - Oh, that's nice. Oh. - Look, guys. Oh! Now it is time for something really exciting. We are all going to draw one of my characters together. And we are going to draw... - The pigeon! - What? No, no. - Pigeon! - That's right. We are going to draw the Pigeon. But why do you keep saying "Pigeon"? - Pigeon! - I don't understand. What's happening? What's going on here? Aah! Pigeon. - Hi, Mo. - What are you doing here? Don't you know the title of the show is "Don't let the Pigeon do Storytime"? - "Don't let the Pigeon do Storytime"? Aw, feathers. - Oh. Pigeon, Pigeon. - What? - Don't be too sad. Listen. How about this as a deal? - What? - We will read - a special story... - Okay. Just for you after the drawing demonstration. - Drawing? I love drawing. I started out as one, you know. - Yeah. Actually, I did. - You were there. - I was there. Yeah. - I remember. The guy with the hand. - It's the one with the pen. All right. Let's get drawing. The cast and crew are gonna go out into the audience and hand out paper and crayons for everybody. It's gonna be awesome. And if you are watching on a screen, you press "pause." Not yet. But go out. Grab some pencils or paper and crayons, and make sure you get some for the grown-ups in the room. Okay, you're ready? We're gonna pause. And... pause. Un-pause. - Here we go. - That's okay. It's okay. It's okay. The pigeon... The pigeon is gonna draw with you and the grown-ups. Is that okay? - Yeah, I got my crayon and my paper all ready. - All right. So... anybody can draw a cartoon. A cartoon is just a bunch of shapes put together in the right order, right? All you have to know is how to write your name, 'cause your name is a bunch of letters put together in the right order. And letters are shapes that you know how to draw. So when you're writing your name, you're making a cartoon. Oh, wait. Here's the other thing. I forgot this. This is really important. Your drawing will look better if you have fun. All right. On the top of our page, we're gonna draw a big letter "O." Letter "O." - Good. - Now, inside that letter "O," we're going to draw a second smaller letter "O." Letter "O." - Letter "O." - It kind of looks like a doughnut. - Whoo. - Okay. Now you have the choice between the letter "M," for Mo, or the letter "W," for Willems. Your choice. Do it sideways. Letter "M." And you have a beak. Now we have come to the most important part of the drawing... Where the eyeball goes. The eye is the window of the soul. If I draw a character with a smile but sad eyes, they're still sad. So if I put my eye up here, he's cheeky. If I put my eye down here, he's sad. If I put my eye in the middle, he's freaked out. All right? I'm in the Kennedy Center dressed, for me, fancily, with some amazing talent. I'm going for freaked out. I'm going in the middle. You draw yours the way you want to. But darken it in. Darken it in, because you always look at the darkest part of a drawing first, and I want you to see the eye first. Okay? We have two lines going down for the neck. Arup! Arup! - Arup! Arup! Arup! - Anthony's got the idea. Did you hear him go "arup, arup"? Do you know why he did that? Very important reason. 'Cause it's fun. How many chances in the day do you get to go "arup, arup" and get away with it? Right? All right. Let's do two across for the collar. Ready? Ehnn! Ehnn! - Ehnn! Ehnn! - Now we have come to my favorite shape because I invented it. See, Mo Willems patented circ-angle. What's a circ-angle you ask? - What's a circ-angle? - A circ-angle is a circle that halfway through its life changes its mind and decides to become a triangle. Ready? Here we go. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh... I'm a circle. I'm a circle. I'm a circle. I'm a circle. I'm a circle. I'll just be a triangle. All right. You guys have got the idea. Let's do two more lines and get those "arup-arups" in. Ready? Arup! - Arup! - Arup! - Arup! - Arup! Okay. My favorite expression is "va-va-voom." You do the three "V's." The first two little ones are feet... letter "V," va. Letter "V," va. - Va. - And now a long one for the wing. A va-voom. - Va-voom. Looks good. - You think we're done? No? Not yet. We forgot the most important part. Write your name so everyone knows that you made this drawing. - "The Pigeon." - Right? Okay, everybody, hold up your pigeons. Let me see those pigeons. Wow! That's great. I love it. I love it. Oh. That's awesome. Hey, Pigeon. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Do you mind if I show your pigeon? - Let me just finish. - Okay. Okay. Okay, go ahead. - All right. Hey, guys, you wanna see the Pigeon's drawing? Yeah. Here we go. Pretty good. - That's how I see myself. Yeah. - Not what I expected, but it's great. - Thank you. - Okay. I have a question. Does your picture look like mine? No. That's a good thing. That means you draw in your own personal drawing style. So let's say maybe you're someone... Can I borrow this drawing? Maybe you're someone who likes to draw big heads. Right? That's very good. Thank you. Or... Oh. Maybe you're someone who likes to draw small birds and their name really big. Right? That's great. Maybe you're someone who's influenced by Cy Twombly. Right? That's really great. Thank you. Or... Let's see. Maybe you're someone who just can't stop making drawings. Look at all these drawings. Oh, my goodness. This one's very realistic as well. I like yours. How about you guys up there in the balcony? Can I see? Oh, wow. And on the second balcony, I see you guys. Those are incredible. What I love about all these pigeons is that they all look so different, and that means that you guys are creating and developing your own personal drawing style. Now, for you grown-ups, it's too late. No, it isn't. It isn't really. Please draw. Please get caught drawing with your kids. It is a physical eyes form of empathy. One more time. You guys mind holding up your pictures? Let's see those pictures! Wow! Look at that. It's crazy the amount of pictures. It's so awesome. Wow. Everybody give yourself a big round of applause for a job well done. - Are we finally ready for my story? - Yes. Yes. It looks like you're ready for it. - Oh, this old thing? Oh, I built it in my backyard. - All right. - All right. So, Pigeon, this is our last story, so I think it should be a really good one. - I think so, too. - You have any ideas? - I would like to read from the classic "The Pigeon Gets Everything He Wants Exactly When He Wants It"... ...and its various sequels and spinoffs. - Well, I, uh... I don't think I've written that book. - Well, you should have. - Get to it, "arup, arup" boy. - Okay, well, I actually thought for a last story that the audience would like to hear this book. "Don't let the Pigeon Drive the Bus." I say personally I find that book to be a downer, but fine. - Here's a question for my audience. Can you say "no"? - No! The answer's yes, I can say no, but that's fine. That was good. Let's hear you say "no!" - No! - Oh, come on. - Pigeons have little ears. Let's hear you say "no!" - No! - Pigeons can be very persuasive. Let's hear you say "no!" - No! - You guys are ready. Okay. Here we go. I... am going to be the bus driver. Okay? - Okay. Yeah, sure. Mo. - Yeah. - Who should I be? - I was kind of thinking, um, the Pigeon. - Narrow casting choice, but okay. - All right. Are you ready for a story? - Yeah! - Do it. - ...by him! Oh! Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! Wow! Buses. I love buses. I wanna marry them. - Hi. I'm the bus driver. I've got to leave for a little while, so can you watch things for me until I get back? - Sure. Yeah. Right. - Yeah, we can do that. Sure. Uh-huh. - Thanks. Oh, and remember, don't let the Pigeon drive the bus. I haven't really figured out where I'm going. I'm just going. - Would you get out of here already! Ah, I thought he'd never leave. Say, uh, can I drive the bus? No! - Please? - No! - I'll-I'll be careful. Okay, I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what. I will just steer. Well, my cousin Herb drives a bus almost every day. But... But it's a true story. Vroom! Vroom! Vroom! Vroomy-vroom-vroom! Pigeon at the wheel! No? I never get to do anything. Ooh, I got an idea. Let's play Drive the Bus. I'll go first. Oh, come on. Just once around the block. We have now reached the rapid-fire round. I'll be your best friend. How about I'll give you 5 bucks? What's the big deal? It's just a bus. No fair. I'll bet your mom would let me. I have dreams, you know. Fine. Fine. Fine! Inhale. Let me drive the bus! - I'm back. - Ohh! - You didn't let the Pigeon drive the bus, did you? Great. Thanks a lot. - Ohh! - Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep. - All my dreams reversing out of my life. - Beep. Beep. Beep. - Hey. Can I drive that truck? Really? Aw, feathers. - The end! - Wow! The Pigeon! - Thank you. The Pigeon, ladies and gentlemen. Before we go... Before we go, please, can I ask anyone in this Kennedy Center space who is a teacher or librarian to raise their hands. Teachers and librarians, raise your hands. I want you to keep 'em up. Because I want you to see what it's like. Not so easy, is it? Yeah. I'm not gonna give you my attention. No, it's a little bit there, but I still don't see you. No. All right, everybody else, give these guys a round of applause. Thank them for what they do every day. Thank you. And thanks, Mr. Fred Newman. The Pigeon! - Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. - The Storytime All-Stars! Wow! Amazing! And thank you. A book doesn't work unless you read it. Thank you! Bye! - Big bow! Big bow! - Big bow! Big bow! Thank you! - Good job, guys. - That was a good show. - It was fun. It was fun. - Great show. - Oh, I'm gonna lie down. - Oh, I'm tired. - Okay. Oh, you had a big day today. You had a big show, and you guys all did great. Okay, so get some rest. We'll see you. Okay. Sleep tight. Can I get a drink of water?
