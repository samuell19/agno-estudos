[Distant Voices] We don't have a pulse. [Distant Voices] Wake up. [Distant Voices] Keep talking to her. [Distant Voices] Hear my voice, Hannah [Distant Voices] Come back. Hannah, come on back. I've got your test results back. Okay. It's not as good as we hoped. The Biopsy we took indicates advanced malignant cells. What does that mean? It's cancer and you're test indicates its advanced to stage four. And that's bad? Yes Hannah. I know this is a lot to take in right now. I understand you went to a lot of specialists who gave you inconclusive results. But yes, these tests are indisputable. Okay, what do I do, what do we do? Well, we have had some success with chemotherapy. Okay. At your advanced stage chemotherapy can buy you a little bit of time, but it will not cure you. The cancer is spreading too fast. How much time? Weeks, months if you're lucky. And there's nothing you can do? No, I'm so sorry. Hannah, wait... There are a few things we can do. We can modify your diet. I can give you some drugs to help with the pain. You can make the best of the time that you have left. Okay. Yeah? Danielle Davis here to see you. Send her in. Danielle, just the girl I wanna see. Sorry to show up like this, I appreciate you. Oh, stop it. Seriously. Now listen, you're paying my rent you can do whatever you want. Sort of, I'm kidding. Sit down, sit down, sit down. Listen, great news, I just got off the phone with Brett Chandler's manager and he's agreed to be your date to the premiere of "“Twist of Fate" ” on Wednesday. Listen David, that what I want to talk to you about- I know you're uncomfortable with the whole thing, but if you want to make it big, that's the way its done. Catherine assures me that you don't have to spend anymore than a couple of days with the guy. Just enough for the press to see you two together, and the rest will take care of itself. Catherine is a genius. I guarantee you the publicity she'll get you, and the opportunities you'll get after this will be well worth a few awkward lunches. Okay? Okay. Okay... Okay. I can see there is something else going on here. Now tell me. What is it? I need to go home. So, don't we all. I have a family emergency and I really have to get back to Indiana. When and for how long? Well, it would only be for- When and for how long? Tomorrow, for at least a few days. [Laughing] Let me just make sure that I'm hearing you right. You're telling me that you want to miss the premiere... an event that is critical to your whole career. I know, I just... it's not that- Listen! Danielle!! Danielle. We need to generate publicity while the fans are still invested. If they really think you fell in love with Brett, they will flock to the theatre just to see where it all started. Public interest means more ticket sales. It means more fans. It means more people that will want a piece of you. That's what you've been working so hard for. Danielle, this business is all about the choices we make, and right now the next few months are very critical. I am really sorry to hear about your mom, I am... but your being there is not going to make that much difference. And frankly, missing this premiere is really not an option. Now, I trust I can count on you to be there, right? Yes. Good. Look, I'm really glad you came in... and look, we're going to get you mother a really nice care package. Trust me, she would want you to be here. Hey, yeah I know. I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah. I'm still here. Can we, um... can we meet up? I um... I... I have- [sighs] I need some more... I ran out. Yeah... Yeah I know the place... okay. Hey. Hey! Good class? Oh yeah. Me and some of the girls are going to hit up that new bar on third. Oh, that sounds like fun, but I- Please come. You never hang out with us anymore. Kyle is actually coming over for dinner tonight. Yeah, I've trying to get Ryan and Kyle together for months now, so... Why? Kyle's my best friend... He should be friends with my husband. [scoffs] Jill... What? Nothing... have fun. Bye. Bye. [coughing, breathing heavily] You alright? [Laughs] Yeah... I was just catching my breath. [Laughs] Breathing's important. You've staked out a good spot. Good book, little lunch, beautiful day... You can hardly beat it. Do you come here everyday? Not everyday, but close. Don't you get restless? Surrounded by all this? Some people crave adventure and excitement... but not me. I like to say in one spot. I'm kind of like these trees, you know? Deep rooted. I get that. Yeah.. believe it or not I've never been on a plane. You know I grew up here, and then my parents- - Well, life happened and I never really wanted to go anywhere, but... I don't know. Now I just... I know I'm going to regret it. You're still young. Not that young. Yeah, regret is a funny thing. It either takes you to the past or the future.... two places we have no power. This moment we're living in right now is the only real place we can make a change. Don't waste your time with regret. If you want something, you go get it. Otherwise, life can do an unfortunate thing. What's that? Pass you by. Hey. Hey. I didn't see you at Gabe's party last week. Yeah, I've been busy. So look, I was totally going to call you back- Just forget it... alright? So you got the stuff? Yeah, of course. Well? You got my cash or do you want to pay me back some other way? Yeah, I got the cash. Fine. What's your deal? Nothing... Look, I'll see you around, okay? Thank you. No way! Are you going to Paris? Um, yes, I hope so. I love Paris. My grandma took me there when I was nine. Oh yeah? Have you been before? Nope, but I've always wanted to go. How long are you going for? I'm not sure. It kind of depends. On what? Just life I guess. Take some pictures for me, will you? Sure. Enough with the grease for the day, I'm out of here. Alright man. I'll take care of the check. I'll see you tomorrow. Have fun. Paris, huh? [Laughs] Hi. Hey, I'm Josh. Hannah. Nice to meet you. Mind if I join you? Sure. Just for a sec. Sure. Okay. Do you come here often? You did not just say that. I did and I'm not even embarrassed about it. Okay, yes, I do. It's quiet here, you know? So I like to come and read. So, you're going to Paris some time soon? Yeah, hopefully. When? Three weeks. Okay. You going with a boyfriend or... I'm moving there actually. Wow, okay. Soon. So, you're going with your friends or your boyfriend? Just me, just me. I have really bad timing. Oh, you have no idea. So, what will you do in the city of love all by yourself? I don't know, you know? I'm just going to paint, explore, just... So, you're a painter? Yeah. I have no artistic talent what so ever. No, but actually I could do a pretty mean stick figure. Oh.. Yeah.. you ready? I'm ready. Wow, that's nice. What is that? That's you. Of course. Oh there I am, the hair. Here, you can have that. Oh, THANK you. That's for you, on the house. On the house? So, what about your parents? They're not going to miss you? My mom would freak out if she couldn't call me everyday. Every week, month. Don't worry about it. I'm totally independent. There is no mom issue. No. Sure. No. Of course. No, actually my parents died when I was eleven. I'm sorry. It's okay, really. It was a long time ago. Makes it easier to move half way around the world, right? Yeah, I guess so. So, what do you do? I'm a lawyer. No you're not. No, I'm not. Do I not look like a lawyer? No. It's my day off, what do you want? I thought they didn't give you guys the day off? They don't. This is me taking advantage of... Look, I haven't had a vacation since I started working. Yeah. I mean I don't know what I would do if I had a week off. What would you do? Something adventurous, something spontaneous. Yeah, like what? Like Paris... maybe. Maybe? Can I see that? Yeah. Hello? Hi David. It's Danielle. I'm at the premiere. What premiere? [Danielle] Twist of Fate? That's next week! What? You told me it was tonight. Didn't Catherine call you and tell you it was pushed? [Danielle] No? [David] Has anyone seen you? No. There's no one here. Just don't move, wait right there. I'm going to call Catherine. [Phone Ringing] [Answering Machine] You've reached the Davis residence. We're not home right now. Please leave a message. Hi Mom... I'm just calling to say that I love you so much. And I wish I was there. I should be there with you. Can you stay here for a minute? I've got to go inside. [Whispers] Ryan please. I'm so sorry. He's just on a business call right now. No worries. Your place is... nice. Seems like forever since I've been here. [Laughs] You're pretty. Kyle never mentioned that. Can I get you a drink? Wine please. Hey Kyle. Ryan, this is Kyle's date, Mandy. Hi. Can I talk to you really quick? Something happened at work. I have to go back to the office. Ryan, no, you promised. I've been trying to set this up for weeks, you know that. I know, I know, I'm sorry... I'll make it up to you. Tell them I'm sorry and... maybe I'll be back for dessert. Okay? What happened? Um... he had to go back to work. I guess it's just going to be the three of us for dinner. More food for us, huh? [Mandy] What are we having? Um, Rosemary Chicken, it's.... It's Ryan's favorite. Oh... you didn't tell her? I'm vegetarian, sorry. Oh... well, hey it's no problem. I can just whip up something else- No forget it. Can I have that wine? In a field where people don't respect the spirit of what the intention is as opposed to the letter may say their guilty. Hey. I'm really sorry. We're trying to close up. Oh god, I'm so sorry. [Waitress] I have to get home to my dogs. Keep the change. You didn't have to do that. No, but then if I didn't, I couldn't call it a date. You really are a lawyer, aren't you? Got to be somewhere tonight? [sighs] Um.. No, no not really. Come on Ben, stop worrying about your stupid job, you should take the shot with me and have a good night, okay? Please? Okay, for you, alright? [Both] To shitty bosses. You're such a girl. [Avery] Better? [Ben] A little bit. Ooh, Danielle Davis, nice buddy. What is she doing here? Yeah, I-I don't know. She's not my favorite Hollywood bombshell, but I see the appeal. I've had like every class with her since like second grade. Danielle Davis, really? [Ben] We all called her Danny back then... I mean her friends did anyway. You guys weren't friends? We were, we were.. well-kinda. I wanted to be, but it just never happened that way. You loved her? Basically yeah, yeah, I did. What happened? I- I never told her. I couldn't tell her... It wouldn't have worked, you know? She wouldn't have been interested... No no no no no, I've been drinking, so I'm going to come off as a babbling idiot- You had one, Ben, you're fine, go! I can't, alright? If I couldn't then. I'm not going to now. I just need to sit here, and... I just-I can't, I can't, okay? Let's just enjoy our time here, okay? Have another drink, or YOU can. I'll just sit here. Okay, then I'm going to go. No, n-n-no, Avery! Don't! Don't do-Oh, Christ, oh God, okay... [Laughing Quietly] [Whispering] Shh, shut up, shut up! Don't wake her up! [Whispering] How many glasses did she have? [Whispering] About a thousand. [Whispering] This way, I won't have to sleep with her tonight. Don't wake her. [Laughs] I'm sorry about Ryan. Does he do that a lot? Yeah... he does, yeah. Why do you put up with it? Isn't that what relationships are about? Compromise? Compromise isn't one sided. People have to take care of each other. He takes care of me. Well, I should probably get her home. Thanks for dinner. Of course. Mandy, let's go. Come on, there we go. [Ben] Don't.. no, no, I said don't! [Avery] Ben, look what I found! Hey, Danny. Wow. No one has called me that in such a long time. Uh, how have you been? Good. Yeah, just busy you know? You should have told me you were living here. Well, I mean, you're uh.. not exactly in the phone book. Oh right, of course. Wow, Ben Jacobson. What a small world. You really look great. Danielle, what are you doing in here? Oh, um, this is my friend Ben- I don't care. We need to leave. Let's go. I guess that's my cue. Yeah. You should give him you're number- No, she's right. Just give me a second. Do you have a pen? Um.... Yes, yes, I do. Let's just do coffee or something. I'd love to. It was really good to see you. Yeah, you too. Bye. Mr. Jacobson's night is looking up! Joe!! You look better this time... yeah. [Laughs] I look like a zombie vampire. A little bit. This is your second one. Oh right, so what do I owe you? [Laughs] Turn it over. Those are lucky numbers. Oh, I bet they are. It's my phone number. You better use it... wisely. You're good, I'm impressed, really, I am. Just promise to call. I promise. Dude, seriously. It's going to be fine. Just walk in, get drugged up, walk out. No brainer. Yeah, it's just that I feel like I waited too long. [sighs] Why did you wait so long? Did you think it was just going to go away? I don't know. I guess I just wasn't ready to deal with it yet. Relax. Here you go... take the edge off. Seriously?!? You just-you just need to relax. Like breathe... deeply... or something. Wish me luck. Luck. Hey man... you got my money? We good? Here. Cheers. Hey sexy. Hey. I'm glad you here. Oh yeah and why is that? I'm all out. Let's see what we can do about that, huh? Anything else? I'm waiting for someone. Okay. Where the hell have you been? Two weeks Brooke? I don't hear from you for two weeks??? What were my rules when you first moved in? One, you tell me where you are. And two, you just come home at night and sleep in your bed. You never pulled this shit with mom and dad- Well, you're not mom and dad. And no one asked you to be my guardian. What's the big emergency Brooke? Why am I here? I have patients... I'm pregnant. I wasn't even going to tell you. I was just going to get it taken care of, but um.. They tell me I can't get an abortion, because I'm too far along. What? Wait, how far along are you? Four months?!? You let this go for four months Brooke?! How could you be this irresponsible??? Look, I'm telling you now alright. I did some research and I found this doctor in Arizona that's willing to do abortions after four months... but um... it's kind of expensive. So, I was hoping- - Hoping that I would help you pay for it. Yeah. How much? Three thousand dollars. God Brooke, how could you let this happen? Are you going to help me or not? Who's the father? Just some guy. It doesn't matter. I will consider loaning you the money. Thank you. But I have conditions. Of course you do... One, you will come home at night, no late that midnight. -Do you want my help or not? Two, you will get a job. A nine to five job with a salary and you and I will work out some kind of payment plan and you will pay me back until it is paid back in full. And you will let me take you and talk to someone about your options. You're not going to some crack pot doctor in Arizona. You have to be more responsible Brooke, no more drinking, no more drugs, no more staying out at night and doing God knows what. If mom were alive- -YEAH WELL SHE'S NOT!! Okay? ...She's not. Get up... we're going home. [Phone ringing] [Ryan] Hey babe. I'm not going to make it home tonight for dinner. [Ryan] You haven't started yet, have you? Nope, haven't started. [Ryan] Please don't be mad, I uh... God, crap- [Ryan] I've gotta go, I'm going to be home really late. So, uh.. yeah, don't wait up. [Ryan] I love you, okay? Hello? [Jill] Hey Kyle. It's Jill. Jill, hey. [Jill] What are you doing? Um... just out with some friends. You should come. Okay. Great, I'll text you the address. Awesome, bye. What am I going to do? You'll figure out something... I just wish you could have known her when our parents were alive... she wasn't always like this. She's a teenager. She needs her parents, but instead she gets me. Sam, come on... No. I just think this is all my fault. You can't blame yourself that you have no control over. Okay? He's just such a jerk Kyle... I don't even know if he loves me anymore. You know Jill, people go through rough patches- -I'm not. Cheers. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Missy! Oh my god, three feet from the drink, come on... I'm having dinner party flashbacks, alright? Jeez, you've had enough. I guess you won't have to sleep with me tonight either? Yeah, I guess not... lucky me. Don't be mean. Whoa, whoa, whoa! [Bartender] Okay, love birds... Last call. [Scoffs] I'll just take the tab please, close it out. [Bartender] Sure, last name? Montgomery. [Mocking] Montgomery. I don't talk like that. No I don't, come on drunkie... get your purse, I'll take you home. Come on. Hey. What do you want? Where you been? My sister's home... you shouldn't be here! Are you mad at me or something? No... Can I come in? No!!! Why not? What's wrong with you? Look, I got to go- Hey, wait wait wait. What's with you, you've just been like so... I don't know, like so- Pregnant... so PREGNANT. I just thought you should know. Well, who's the... Who's the father? I don't know.. just some ASSHOLE. Who? YOU, Brian! Are... A-Are you sure? Yeah... I'm sure... because unlike you, I don't go sleeping with everything that moves!!! You know what, just go... JUST GO!!! GO!!! Well... I guess I should go inside. Yeah, yeah... You need me to walk you to your door? Oh no I can... get it. Um... Okay, um... Kyle I'll um... I'll talk to you tomorrow. [Car Door Shuts] This is not easy.. This is not just another girl. This is Danielle Davis.... what am I doing? [Phone Rings] Hello? Hey, uh, Danny! It's... It's Ben! Uh.. Jacobson? Ben, it was great to see you. How are you? I'm great. I'm great... Um... Hey, listen, uh... I was just wondering, maybe you wanted to- [Ben] Uh, you know, grab a drink, or... [Ben] Maybe.. maybe even dinner, sometime? With, like, you know, sometime being this week... You know, with uh, with... w-with me? Yeah, yeah, you know, I would love to. You know... uh, shoot, this week I'm super busy... Oh, okay, um... That's-That's fine. Maybe some other time. Well, hey. I'm meeting some friends tonight for dinner and... [Danielle] Maybe you could come by afterwards and meet for some drinks. That's perfect. [Danielle] Okay see you then. Alright, bye. [Phone Vibrating] Hello? Hey, It's Kyle! Oh hey. [Kyle] Listen... I just wanted to clear the air and make sure you weren't feeling weird about the other night. Feeling weird? When I drove you home. [Jill] Oh god... I was so drunk... did I do something stupid? Nope.. No, you were perfect. [Kyle] I got two tickets for the ballet tomorrow night, a friend of mine is dancing in the show. I thought she'd be a great person for you to meet. Yeah. She starting her own dance company and I've been telling her about you, so... [Jill] Yeah. I'd love to. [Kyle] Great, great... [Kyle] You want to just meet me at the theatre around seven then? Um, yeah, okay, let me just double check here... Checking, checking... Yeah, okay, great! Cool! I'll see you there. Okay, bye. Oh great, you're ready... let's go. What are you talking about, I'm going to the ballet with Kyle. No... You can't do this to me babe. I told you WEEKS ago about this, it's the company party. Kyle has a friend that works in the ballet, he could get me a job- -Jill. Babe, please... All the guys are bringing their wives and all the contacts for the company are going to be there... It's a big, big deal. This is a big opportunity for me, I- -Yeah, but... please. Fine. [sighs] Okay, great... Let's go. I, uh... I had a really great time tonight. Yeah, yeah, so did I. Do you remember this song? It was the summer after senior year? Yeah... yeah, yeah. That was back in the day. It was the week before I moved back to LA. Every sound... taste... it was so precious. I miss that feeling. I, uh... Did you, uh... did you know I had a bit of a crush on you in high school? Really? You did? Yeah, uh... HUGE, actually... Why didn't you do anything about it? I don't know... We were friends and... and even if I had, you wouldn't have been interested- Thank you for tonight. I, uh... I had a great time. You're welcome. Bye. Bye. Just do it! Just do it! Hi. Hi. What is going on with you? You were REALLY rude during dinner- You knew how important those clients were to me, you could have given me at least ten percent of your energy!! Maybe I would if I didn't feel so completely ignored and unwelcome!!! ALL NIGHT!!! Watch your tone... My tone... I missed a once in a lifetime chance because you said you NEEDED me!!! I do EVERYTHING for you... I ask ONE thing from and you can't do it without complaining!! EVERYTHING?!? You do EVERYTHING?!!!- YES!! YES!! EVERYTHING!! SCREW YOU, RYAN!!! Hello? [Muffled] Yeah hey, it's Josh. [Muffled]... Hello? Just a sec... Hey. Hey, uh.... how did you find out where I lived? You shouldn't put your home address on your business cards. I didn't give you this? AND you promised you would call me. Look, it doesn't matter, I know you're leaving in three weeks... and I just wanted to see you. Josh this is really sweet, I just- - I came all this way, brought you coffee... let's just go for a walk... please? I just really need this to stay simple. It is simple; It's a beautiful day outside... cup of coffee... Just coffee. Hey... and that, that's it. Okay... one second. Sorry it's such a mess in here, I... wasn't expecting this. Yeah, I wasn't either.... believe me it is the last thing in the world I... No, no, I mean in a good way, in the best possible way, you know? Because you have no idea, how long I've wanted... You know what? Just... never mind. You're cute. Shut up! Wow... Jesus, your parents haven't changed at all. Do you want blueberry or plain? I remember your mom making the best pancakes that I ever tasted. When did you have my mom's pancakes? Oh, fourth grade, I think? We were all at your house rehearsing this little play I had written... I don't remember what it was, but... - No, no. That's right it was uh... about the mouse who gets super strength after eating magical cheese. Hey, don't laugh, alright? It was a brilliant title AND plot line. You still writing? Umm... not so much, I mean... not as much as I'd like to. Why not? You know, just... work. You work in publishing, right? Yeah, I'm a book editor though. Right. Yeah, you know, my day is spent correcting other people's work... Yeah, AND, to top it all off, my boss is a gigantic tool. Did I happen to mention that? Well, you should quit. Well, I hope you keep on writing, I mean... you were so good at it when we were kids. You know what, I think I have those plays stashed somewhere. Wow, I'd love to see them... So, you're parents still live on Barnette? Yeah, they do, you still my neighbor? My parents moved away shortly after my sister and I graduated college. Well, that's too bad... You had a great house. Yeah, it was... I especially loved the second story window that looked right into your bedroom. What?! You little perv! Only once I hit puberty, okay? Before that you were just the smelly girl next door. Oh and you were the little jerk who always took my seat on the bus! Whoa, whoa, you loved me. Yes... I did. So, how are Frank and Donna anyway? They're not great, actually... my mom had to have surgery last week. Jesus... Yeah, it's a pretty big deal. I'm sorry, is she okay? Yeah, she'll be fine... She's, uh... recovering, slowly... It's just, I... wasn't there. Well, I had this thing... [sighs] ...actually, I didn't, which is the worst part about it. My agent guilt tripped me into staying, so I could go to this premiere with Brett Chandler. Oh, you and he are... -No no no, God no, that's a... publicity thing, which is a whole other nightmare. But my agent made it sound like I would ruin my career if I left, so I stayed... I missed my mom's surgery... and the premiere is not even happening 'til later this week. I haven't seen my parents since Christmas. I should have been there. I know what its like to have to choose between your career and... I don't know... your life, I guess... especially when everything is pushing on you from all sides. My career has been everything to me... For so long and... I have no control. Come on, yeah you do... You just... have to take it back. [Phone Vibrating] [Answering Machine] Hey, it's Brooke, I'm not here, obviously, so leave it at the beep. Hey Brooke, it's me... I was just calling to see if you were going to Seth's thing tonight... And um... I wanted to talk to you about something, it's not really a big deal. I just- I've been doing a lot of thinking... and, um... I, I-I got you something... I wanted to help you out... I-I-If you want.. So um... give me a call back, okay? Alright, bye. I'm starving. Oh thank God... I've been dying to say something, but didn't want you to think I was trying to leave. Well, let's go get some food. Maybe we should change first. You're right, stay like this, it will be very incognito... Where do you want to go? I'm going to take you somewhere, but, it's a surprise. Really? But first I'm going to run to my car so I can change. Okay, but I'm driving, because if you drive we won't get there until after the restaurant closes. Whoa, whoa, I don't drive THAT slow... [Laughs] Yes, you do. [Ben] Alright, fine! Fine, you can drive. Fine, I will! I'm just going to go change first. [Paparazzi] Danielle, Danielle!! Danielle!!! [Paparazzi] What's it like to be America's sweetheart, huh? Who's the guy??? [Paparazzi] What's your name, kid?? [Danielle] Don't you guys ever take a night off?!? [Paparazzi] Cmon kid, what's your name? [Ben] Uh, it's uh.. Ben. [Ben] Listen, could you just- [Danielle] -Just don't say anything. [Paparazzi] So still single, huh? [Danielle] Still single... What's going on? You have no idea what my life is, okay?? I need you to not be here right now. [Paparazzi] Yeah, go ahead, we don't need you anymore! Buh-bye! What's wrong? You're moving. Yeah, I know. Why? Josh... No, I'm serious. Look, you never told me... why? I really don't want to talk about it right now, okay? You can't get invested in this. Just like that? Just like what? I wanted to know you... Why, why can't you let me in, hm? Josh, I-Stop, stop, stop... Why do you keep pulling away? Look, I didn't call you, okay? I really don't know how to be clearer than that. And today? That doesn't mean anything? - Okay, see, but that's the thing, you've never once asked me what I feel! It's just, it's all been about you! I can't stay here with you, it isn't up to me... will you please stop asking? You have to stop asking so much! Shit!! It's nothing, alright Josh? I really need you to go... - Josh, this has nothing to do with you, THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU!! I NEED YOU TO GO!! - You can't help me, okay? Nobody can help me!! Hannah, what is it?!!... Look at me, WHAT IS IT?! JOSH, I HAVE STAGE FOUR CANCER, OKAY?!? Will you please... go? I'm not leaving... You're off the hook, okay? I don't expect you to stick around for this... I don't want to stick around for this- -Stick around? Please... I know that you're going to find someone really great. I really like you... but if you stay... I've got something really big to lose. [Hannah] I can't handle it. Where's my money?!! It's probably just Brian... Jamie... what's wrong? It's Brian... Can you give us a minute... What's going on? He's dead, Brooke... [Phone Vibrating] Hello? I'll be there... Catherine, I'll BE there. [Voicemail] Hey Brooke, it's me... [Voicemail] I was just calling to see if you were going to Seth's thing tonight... [Voicemail] And um... [Voicemail]... I wanted to talk to you about something, it's not really a big deal. [Voicemail] I just- [Voicemail] I've doing a lot of thinking... [Voicemail Box] You have no new messages. Hey, Ben. These just came in from the new author. He wants to get things moving. Yeah, okay... Um, I can get them going tomorrow- - Yeah, that's the thing, I'm going to need these on my desk tomorrow. There is no way I can do this whole thing by tomorrow, okay? Well, then you're going to have to be here 'til two in the morning. No, no, not this time, I can't. Look, I have things I need to do. Look, yeah, you may have little things you need to do, but... You get these done and you have them on my desk by the morning... or you're fired. That won't be necessary. Good! I'm glad we see eye to eye. It won't be necessary because I quit. Quit? Quitters never make anything of themselves, Ben! What the hell is this?? He's just a friend. Oh, you kiss all your friends like that?!? I don't know what to say... You, Y-You're in serious breach of you contract... This could ruin everything we set up for you and Brett!! EVERYTHING we set up to advance your career!! To bring YOU closer to YOUR dreams!! I don't like the way you're talking to me- -EXCUSE ME?!? Look, you know something? You better figure out how you're going to fix this... Because as much as I like you... I will drop you like a bad habit. If you EVER pull anything like this again. Is THAT clear?!? I'm done. When I get back from visiting my parents... I'll be signing with a different agent. Goodbye, David! [Door Knock] Who is it? [Muffled] It's Josh. Come in. Hi. The truth is, I can't walk away. I want to spend this time with you. And it doesn't matter if it's a year, week, or a day... I'm here. Okay. Thank you. I'm so sorry... what's going on? I left Ryan. What? This is big! Yeah. I mean, I always thought Ryan was always kind of a selfish jerk. Well, why didn't you say something? How could I? You married him so fast and... I wanted to be supportive. Ugh, that was my first mistake... Look... I know it sucks right now, but... Yeah, I just, I feel like I wasted so much time, you know? The four years I spent with Ryan, I could have spent with.. I don't know. With who? Well, no one. With Kyle? What? You and Kyle have had thing for each other since day one. [Laughs] That is so not true, we're just friends. He's been madly in love with you forever... He just... couldn't do anything about because you were already with Ryan. Is that true? Yeah. I think you guys should go for it. You want the last bite? No, you. Okay. Hey... are you okay? [Speaking French] Très bien (Very good) What? Toi (Thee) Moi? (Me?) Oui. (Yes.) Whoa, slow... It's only my third day of learning this. I know how to say... yes, no, and uh... my girlfriend is very beautiful. Girlfriend, huh? Hey... don't do that. Okay. You're so strong. Thank you. I'll be right back okay. Okay. Don't get any ideas... It's still mine. [Laughs] [Waitress] For you maam? [Guest] Uh.. apple pie. Apple pie, thank you. Oh, great... You got some nerve, you know... You think you can just use people and throw them away like they don'teven matter? Ben was one of the good ones... If you mess him up for the rest of us I will literally find you, and kill you. Listen, Avery. I didn't- -Save it... [Samantha] Are you okay? Yeah. Listen Brooke, there's something I need to tell you... Okay? I freaked out on you the other day when you told me about the baby... No shit... and it wasn't entirely fair. Is this an apology- -It's an explanation. Greg and I have actually been trying to get pregnant... and it's been really tough. You never told me that. We were kind of waiting until we... The truth is we went to see a fertility specialist... and I have what they call a hostile uterus... so the chances of us getting pregnant are really slim. So you showing up the other day and telling me about the baby was kind of like pouring salt on the wound... which isn't your fault, but- The point is... I'm sorry about the way I acted. It's okay. Look Brooke, I know things have been really weird between us ever since mom and dad died, and... I just never knew how to- It's like you not a kid anymore, but you're not an adult either... all I want is for you to be safe. I know. And I know I hold you to an impossibly high standard sometimes, but I just want the world for you, and, so did mom and dad. Hey Kyle... it's me. Hannah, Hannah, hey... Oh my God, I NEED SOME HELP HERE, I NEED SOME HELP!!! CALL AN AMBULANCE!! [Hannah Narration] It's a funny thing, regret. [Hannah Narration] It takes us into the past... [Hannah Narration] and into the future. [Hannah Narration] Two places where we have no power. [Hannah Narration] It's only here, in this moment, that change is possible... [Hannah Narration] If you want something, go and get it... [Hannah Narration] ...or life will do an unfortunate thing... [Hannah Narration] ...Pass you by.
