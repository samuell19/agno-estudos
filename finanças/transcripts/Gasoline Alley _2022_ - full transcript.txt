You got sad eyes. Not my usual pick-up line, but... I just sensed you are a man running from shadows. What's your usual pick-up line? When I see a guy alone at the bar at 3:00 in the morning, I lean in real close and whisper in his ear: "For 510 bucks, we can spend an hour. For 1,000, we can spend a night." Why 510? 'Cause the ATM only spits out 20s. I've never had a john ask me to break a note. That's actually smart. So? See that? Gasoline Alley... Jimmy Jayne. You sure about this? I'm sure, I'm sure. Okay. Okay. Who's Shelby? She rocks my world. You're a lucky gal. Yeah, we both are. Right there? Hold on. James Jayne? Yeah. That's what it says on my license. Detective Freeman. This is Detective Vargas. Hi. Okay. Yeah, your old man was on the force, wasn't he? 14th precinct. Hmm, how's he doing? I don't think he's doing much of anything. Spends his days at the Fitzgerald Cemetery. He was a good cop. Damn good cop. Always paid his tab. Did you ever consider the force? Yeah. You ever think about it? No, never. That's yours, right? I mean, it's my shop's lighter. Right. James... sorry, may I call you, "James"? The reason that we're here is we need to talk to you about the four dead girls. Okay? What's that have to do with me? The lighter, it was found at the crime scene. What's your point? What was it doing there? I don't know what it's fucking doing there. I once found my lighter floating in a urinal at a Duke's. Am I a suspect? You were seen with one of the victims at Rocka's, okay. Thing about Rocka's, it's over on the other side of town and there are 100 good watering holes in between here and there, right? Yeah. Yeah, again, again, what's your point? My point is why drive all the way over there like I was saying, it's a long ways away. Sentimental reasons. Such as? My mother used to work there. Okay. Behind the bar? No, not behind the bar. Oh. Uh, Jimmy, excuse my partner. He still doesn't know what side of the bed to wake up on. He's right. We have some photos, maybe you could uh, ID some of the victims. That'd be helpful. Holy shit, you don't even know their names. James, we're gonna need to talk to you in private, okay? The sooner, the better. All right, give me an hour. I got a customer. No, we need to talk to you right now, so the tramp stamp will have to wait. How you doin', darlin'? What you gonna get, a unicorn? I hope you can be discrete. Last thing we need is a media circus. Yeah, he's right, 'cause if that happens, then the D.A., he puts pressure on us to pin it on some poor schmuck. All right. I'll go ahead and get started, right, boss? - Yes. - Okay. For the record, I'm Detective Vargas. That's Detective Freeman. And we're conducting an interview with Mr. James Jayne concerning case V-7-7-4-3. They suffer? What do you think? I think it's a fair fucking question, that's what I think. Yeah, they suffered. I imagine you already questioned the guests, staff? Since 5:00 a.m. this morning. 63 rooms. Yeah, nobody suspicious. Nobody caught our attention, except you. Security cameras? They didn't have any at the rat trap they found 'em at, but they're on camera leaving the bar. Then you're on camera a few seconds later following 'em out the door. I had a drink, and I left. What time? 2:30. Give or take. Talk to anybody while you were there? Yeah. What were you doing there? I was fucking guys. - Easy. - It's just juries, they don't look real favorably on uncooperative witnesses. - Right? - Right. Look, why don't you just show me the pictures? 'Cause something tells me somebody told you I was with the girls that night. You want to see the pictures? Sure, we'll show you the pictures. Pretty sordid. Let me just start back at the beginning here. Here we go. Huh, pretty gnarly, right? Gnarly? Recognize any of them? Boom, boom, boom, what you think? That's pretty bad. Go back. - That's Star. - Huh. That's what she told me her name was. You ever seen these girls before? Not before last night. You talked to Star, what about? - Business. - What? - Business. - Tattoos or movies? She was an actor. Aspiring actor. Am I the only suspect? Person of interest. So Star, I'm assuming she was a working girl. Yeah. Did she make you an offer? Of course she did. Did you take her up on it? Or did you try and bargain with her? Maybe when you tried to bargain with her, you kind of made her feel a little cheap... Fucking what? Then she said something nasty, who knows? Maybe that hurt your feelings, and then you thought, "Hey, I'm really gonna let her have it." Double fucking talk. Did you hook up with her? No. I told her I was meeting with somebody after. And who is that? This girl I run around with. Christine. - Okay. - Are we done here? No. So I'm just trying to get all this straight in my head, - maybe you can help me, boss? - Yeah. - So the bar, it closes at 2:30. - Right. That gives you 45 minutes to kill 'em. Stage 'em. Then mosey on over to this Christine girl. And you asked, "Did they suffer?" Their necks were broken. All four of 'em. Of course, that's not real difficult. When you got poor helpless girls all whacked out on junk and blow, God knows what else. Now the only suspect description we got is of a Caucasian shitkicker. You seen any of those lately? Get the fuck out of my shop. I actually think we're done here and we probably don't need to tell you this, but don't leave the country, hell, don't leave the county. We can haul you in on a Ramey warrant anytime, okay. So yeah, you're still a suspect, got it? Don't worry, if you get found guilty, we'll walk you down to the electric chair ourselves. It's like that old gospel number, You'll Never Walk Alone. Let's hit it, boss. Good talking to you. Nice spot. Fuck! Christine. Hey. One sec, come here. You get my text? Cops calling on me at work ain't a good look, Jimmy. They wanted to confirm you were on your way to see me last night. What'd you say? I told 'em, yeah. The bald one, he thought I'd be all bent about you flirting with those poor girls. I told 'em, nah, it ain't like that. He flirts with everybody, that's what makes him Jimmy. Attagirl. The other one, he acts all best friends bonding shit, wasn't shy about doing a little flirting himself. Fuckin' asshole. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa. - Oh God. - Whoa. - All right. - Whoa, whoa. Coming up on Eye Witness News, the DEA have discovered another tunnel connecting Tijuana to a residence in San Diego, the longest yet at 4.2 miles. More on the investigation into the Four Beauty murders. Police are searching for answers. Those stories and more coming up. Precinct. Yeah, Detective Freeman please. It's Jimmy Jayne. Connecting. Precinct. Vargas, please. Jimmy Jayne. Connecting. Hey, James. Where's Freeman? Yeah, Freeman's at a deposition right now. What do you want? Anything more on the four girls? No comment. So you got nothing. It's an ongoing investigation. And no other suspects but me? Let's just say you're a person of interest and we'll leave it at that. Okay? You think I did it? Hey, the evidence says what it says. I'm gonna text you my number and if you think of anything, well, don't be a stranger. That cool? Good. Coming this fall, blockbuster story continues Sunday night, 7:00 p.m. Starring Faith Hope and Dennis Bourke. American Siege. JJ, the man, the myth, the legend! What's good, bro? I need to see you. Of course, bro, anything for you. You want to uh, meet up next week? No, today would be better. Uh, I'm on set, bro. All right, text me the address, call your security, let 'em know I'm coming by. Okay, tight. Uh hey, hey, bring your kit. Yeah, all right. Whatever. All right, dope. Wait, cut! Cut the fucking shot. Can someone get this asshole out of my eyeline? Again, dude. It happened again! Fucking day, it's something else. Jesus, what the fuck... Goddamn rookies. What's up, big dog? See me looking like a badass, shooting these fucking guns. They should let me shoot a real one, huh? Ain't gonna make the show easier to watch. I know you didn't just come here to bruise my ego. Rub your paycheck on it, that'll make it feel better. Yeah, that's good. All right, Jimmy, what's the favor? You're in the scene, right? I do okay. It's not really your vibe though, if that's what you're asking. Don't use that tone of voice with me. Remember who kept you safe on the inside. Yeah, I know. You know how grateful I am that you protected me when I was in there. I bet your friends think you're tough doing three months hard time for a fucking DUI or whatever. I wonder what they'd say if they find out you cried yourself to sleep every night worried Kratos from Cell Block E was gonna make you his little fucking bitch. I'm grateful that you fucked him up for me. How grateful? Anything for a friend, Jimmy. Got your kit? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, all right. Come on. Heard they're already planning a rip-off episode about the dead girls. Bullshit. I swear to God. The writer's PA with the fat ass told me last night. That is tasteless. I knew one of 'em. From where? Some party. Whose? Persi Muleeney, something. Get the fuck outta here. That's a made-up name. I swear to God, man, she was all over me. What was her name? She didn't tell me her real name. Don't tell me. "If you forget..." "...you just gotta look up." - Yeah. - You knew Star? Briefly. Tell me about the guy running the party. Persi? I... I didn't know it was his party. Finds girls on OnlyFans and Craigslist, turns 'em into porn stars and escorts. They float around the scene for a little bit then they just disappear, that's all I know. What do you mean disappear? I mean they go back to bumfuck Idaho wherever the hell they came from. Man, this J-bird fucking with you? No, man, we're all right, aren't we? - Are we? - Yeah, we're good. This is Jimmy Jayne. This guy's a motherfucking legend right here. - True genius. - Pleasure to meet you. Oh, so you guys inside together? - How'd you know? - Come on, man. 'Cause all your other friends that come here, look like Ken dolls. No offense. Yeah, fucking right we were in. This dude did half the art in San Quentin. Why don't you tell him about the time I fucked up Kratos in the yard? You know the story. Yeah, I remember that, sure. He was uh... he was fresh meat. Wouldn't let anybody fuck with him, so he beat a man unconscious on his first night with his bare hands. Yeah. Bullshit. - That's a fucking lie. - It's a lie. Hey, but you're a great friend to try to make this punk-ass look good. Hey, you can't talk to me like that, bro. You're a fucking set mechanic. I'm number one on the call sheet, all right. Calm down, kid. Calm down. You took this gig for money just like everybody else. We're making art, all right. - Art? - Yeah. This show makes a dumpster fire look like Citizen Kane. Yeah, well, this show is number one in the country, we are number one. That says more about society than the quality of your show. Hey, listen, I have a 66 Chevelle that's got a bum clutch. - You got a card? - Yeah. - Here man, call me anytime. - Thank you. - You guys good? - Yes, sir. Where you wanna do this? Well, I want 1-1-7 right here. It's how many people watched last week's episode. 117? Million, yeah. I know, I can't believe people pay to watch this shit either. Let's go in my trailer. Action! - Dennis! - Hey, dude. Dennis, up! Oh, shoot! Fuck you, motherfuckers! Hi. Now what? Well, found your fingerprints on your lighter. Who'd have thought? And? We got motive, we got access, and we're one hair follicle away from writing your warrant. How'd you find me? You got a GPS in your pocket, buddy. You need a warrant to track a phone. You know you're actually correct about that. But the thing is judges these days, they're real busy and they know we're the good guys. So they kinda let it slide. Now, you gonna offer me a cigarette or what? No, it's cool, I actually quit. Here's the deal. Everybody I talk to across the board, they all say you're a stand-up guy, except for the five years in the pen for putting a guy in a wheelchair. I didn't start that fight. But you sure ended it, didn't you? And I bet you'd do it all over again. Came at me with a screwdriver. Screwdriver. Shit, that's a deadly weapon. You know a guy named Persi? I don't remember his last name. Fucking Persi something, whatever. Why? Used to run with Star. You playing detective now? Just concerned citizen. I like that. You know, uh, I found out why you hang out at Rocka's bar. Should have just told me your mom was a working gal. There's no shame in it. Detective Freeman, he told me that was her spot until, you know, she went missing. And of course, your dad, he lost his mind trying to find her. I'm just saying, you know, I... I get it. I understand why you feel so connected to the case. Sure do have a way with words. Hey pal, James, Jimmy, I uh... you know, that's as close as you're gonna get to an apology from me. Yeah, fine, well... I have to go. Just, hey, take it easy. Let us do our thing. Detective Freeman, he's a great cop and me, I'm the best thing that ever happened to the Robbery-Homicide Unit. How many cases you close last year? You want my numbers now? You want my stats? I mean, if they were any good, you'd be squawking about 'em. Oh, come on. You speak to Star's family? Tell 'em what happened? Well, they disowned her a long time ago, but they're raising her kid as their own. How old? 4. Actually the same age as my boy Terry. James, just don't go kicking the hornet's nest. 'Course not. - You understand? - Yes. Okay. I'll catch you later. Hey man, don't fuck that paint. I can't be assed with an L & D form. You got Roy. Roy, it's Jimmy. I met you on set. Hey, buddy, what's going on? Someone tried to run me down just now. No shit. Someone tried to kill you? Yeah. That's not what makes it personal, so much as they fucked up my ride. Holy shit, man! You know who it was? If I did, I wouldn't say so on the phone. You know what, it's nothing. It don't sound like nothing to me, man, but what's it like to be you? It was a Rover Wagon. It was super charged. Had some real fucking balls to it. Still not the smartest way to try to kill somebody. Yeah, maybe they're smarter than you think, man. Random ex-con cut down on the side of the road? Who'd give a shit? Yeah, that's one way to put it, I guess. Rover's a lot bigger than a bullet though, bro. Oh no, they came at me with those, too. Listen... I got this feeling that you might be able to uh, you know, get me some sort of protection. You know what I'm talking about? 10-4, good buddy. I know you're a kindred soul of the heathen brethren. I'm gonna take that as a yes. Of course it's a yes, man. Send me the address. I'll text it to you. So this doesn't add up. How does Jimmy go from felony assault to multiple homicides? I don't get it. - The old days... - Yeah. You told me about, you'd just taken a telephone book to 'em. Now I gotta actually question people - and go fucking by the book. - Right. - Yeah. - Pain in the ass. - Well... - Mhmm. I guess I'll take care of this here, - you gonna hit the game? - Yeah. Who is it this week? - Malibu. - Right. If they don't beat them, who can they beat? Yeah. Exactly. I'll take care of this, all right. - All right. - I got it. I hope they win. I didn't think you'd show. Every brother needs a keeper from time to time. Are you sure you want this? I got someone trying to pin a bunch of murders on me. I'm not going back inside, especially not for something I didn't do. Easy, new friend, easy. The fuck am I into? Show business, son. It's the most gangster game out there. You got family? No, not since my dad died. Hmm, how'd he go? Bottle. Hmm. Come here, let's do this. Your dad teach you how to shoot? All right. You got six rounds in there. There you go. How much do I owe you? Nothing, man. Just a favor down the line. All right. Anytime. Yeah, I'll hold you to that. But you be careful, man. - See you. - Thank you. I may have to get out of town. We should go somewhere. Huh, I got that ticket to Berlin, baby. What ticket? I didn't tell you? I would have remembered. I'm leaving Monday. Sandy is there as an au pair, we'll hang, I hear it's a good scene. Berlin? It's in Germany. Yeah. You live in the moment, Jimmy. Yeah. Fucking Berlin. Jimmy Jayne. What's up, buddy? - How you doing? - Good. I need a favor. You know I can't get back into the evidence locker. They won't let me back there. - It's not that kind of favor. - What is it? I need you to run a name through IVIS. What's the name? Oh fuck. Uh... Peter Mul... Persi Mul, something or other. Mul something. What is that? Persi Muleeney? That's it. Man, he lives up on Mulholland. He's got an office down on Skid Row. You know him? Yeah, everybody knows him. He's a popular guy. Give me a current address. Look, man, is this something that's gonna come back - and bite me in the ass? - No, never. - Yeah. - Absolutely not. Yeah, I believe you again, huh? Look, man, you know I'll lie on the stand, right, say you had a gun to my head. That's why I love you, brother. You really are LA's finest, huh? Aww, that's sweet. Fuck you, too. Can you tell me what he's driving? Seems his 2011 Land Rover was reported stolen yesterday. You didn't get that from me. He's having a party up at his place tonight. Lot of cops gonna be there, 'cause we get in free. Yeah. Seems he knows what lives matter most. All right. Stay lucky, buddy. Next time have the decency to buy me a fucking coffee. Private party tonight. I'm on the list. You a cop? Yeah, 14th. Where's your badge? It's in the car. Want to hear a bad joke? A bad joke? A really bad one. I do want to hear a bad joke. Shoot. What are the three words to ruin man's ego? What are the three words to ruin a man's ego? Is it in? So it's like '88, '89. We're driving to Barstow like 3:00 in the morning, right. We're sweating like bullets, and we run out of cocaine and I mean me and Tai, we're sweating. We're sitt- Only thing I know is we're gonna go meet a one-armed dope dealer with a good... Yo. You Persi? I don't even know your name, friend? Jimmy Jayne. Mind if I have a minute? Mind if I have a... Yeah, well, I mind. I'm sitting here telling a story to all my friends. Is this about a job or something? Yeah, I'm sorry. Go ahead, finish your story. You were with a couple of dudes or something? So it's Barstow. Three- Barstow! Holy shit, I love Barstow. You do, you love... They had the swap meet down there, you ever been? I been to Barstow, I never been to a fucking swap meet. - Street rods mostly. - Yeah. I'm sorry. Go on. Finish your story. It's like 3:00 in the morning, going into Barstow... Wait, wait, wait. Going into the Torches Motel... Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You're ruining my story. One thing, they got this red-headed mayor, I'm fucking telling you, she's got big fucking tits. And man, she loves to ride. She loves to ride, huh? Who the fuck invited you to my party? I invited me. I was hoping to have a minute in private, but suit yourself. Gisella, Lana, and Star. You ever heard those names before? I'll give you a hint. They're not fucking race horses. Kaiser, get this motherfucker out of here. Hold on, Kaiser. You ever met 'em? No, I can't say I have. You like jokes? Yeah, who don't like a fucking joke. If this is a joke, I don't find it funny. I'ma tell you... I'ma tell you a joke. Three words to ruin a man's ego? "Is it in?" Now get the fuck out. You heard that one before. Yeah, I heard, I'm the one who wrote it. 'Cause this girl told it to me the other night. What girl? Same girl you said you never met. She heard it in my movie. I just told you, David Cop-A-Feel. It's... Anybody who watches pornos, watch... knows the fucking line. It's famous. Now get the fuck out of here! Of course it is. Night, guys. Is that coke? And they're fucking passed out? Yeah, I got fucking coke. Can I rip a line of blow? You get the fuck out of my house, you can't have none! Oh to be you, huh. Small dick motherfucker. - You really a cop? - No. I seen them here, those girls. Come with a sista I knows. Eleanor Rogers. She's one, uh, 20 feet from stardom types. Backup singer. Preacher's daughter. Why you telling me this? The fuck? Motherfucker, I'm telling you. Leave it at that. Get the fuck outta here. Thanks. That was you singing, huh? Guilty. It's a recording studio? I'm looking for Miss Rogers. Miss Eleanor Rogers. Why? Our mutual friend Kaiser says we should talk. About? About something we're both involved in, we shouldn't be. I'll be at Shay's on 3rd, okay. Hey, you got a light? Yeah. Don't lose it. There's already enough of those floating around. You don't mean Persi Muleeney? Nah, he ain't got it in him to murder any girls like that. He ain't that slick. But he knows some fucking cats doing some fucked up shit. What cats? He likes to strut with a scary crowd with his tail all up in the air. But as much as he likes to be on this gangsta shit, they just take his money and laugh at his dumb white ass. Drug people? Fuck yeah. Cartel hookup. Why's someone like you hanging out with someone shady like Persi? Someone like me? He told me he'd put up all kinds of money to help me put out a solo album. And did he? No. Said if I could fuck like I could sing... Well, I'm not even gonna tell you the rest of that 'cause I don't want my father's ghost hearing that come out of my mouth. Persi said he never met the girls. Oh, honey, no, no, he lied. What else? Those girls, I mean, oh my God, the way they were found like that, I mean, that was somebody sending a message. You said that wasn't Persi's style. No, no. I think it was... it was like those people I was talking about earlier, the ones that likes to use Persi's house like it's theirs. "Scary crowd". Shit, you ain't heard this from me. That scene is a blackhole. Girls come up missing all the time, guys always trying to take advantage of the situation. There was this one creeper at a party one night. Late like 4:00 in the morning. Silver-haired dude. Now we were gonna go to the patio and get high. Anyway, the silver-haired dude was inside and I saw him talking to some girls who had been there, I'd seen them a couple of times and they were giving him money. About a week later, I'm pulled over for not using my turn signal, and it was him, the silver-haired dude. He's a fucking cop. - Is he a stocky guy? - Yes, yeah. Uh, Flosso. Officer Flosso, that was the name on the ticket. Right, right. The girl said he was a cage fighter. Our friend Kaiser, I need to talk to him again. Well, I'll give you his number, but, you know, don't expect much. He's a moody motherfucker, like you. Oh, one more thing, and maybe it's nothing but the silver-haired guy, I saw him take some money and then give it to this guy, the "Doc". Well, we called him "Dr. Feelgood", because, you know, he was giving out pills like it was candy. Big beard and the curly-ish hair, deep voice, like... I don't fucking know, that also happened. I don't know if that helps. I wish I'd met you a week ago. Oh, what do you do? What do I do? Yeah? Um, uh, a lotta this, lately. No, when you're not creeping on singers outside of studios. Did you say creeping? I... Um, what do I do? - I do uh, I do tattoos. - Hmm. And uh... motors. - Hmm, rock 'n' roll life. - Yeah. - Very cool. - It's right. It's good people mostly. - Yeah. - You got any ink? Oh man, no. I never found anything that I wanted to stay with me for life, you know. Oh. Sometimes a tattoo is just a tattoo. Okay, well then how come most girls get a rose or a dolphin? Fucking angel wings. - How trashy is that? - Touché. - It's so trashy, right. - Touché. Yeah, well, you know times are... times are tough. Ink is ink. Oh, and that's when you do those kind of tattoos. I draw the line at tramp stamps. Oh. Well, it is good to know there's a line. Yeah, there is. No, they all mean something. - It's not gonna run out on you. - No. That's a different story, probably a different tattoo. Oh, I have to go. That is my 15. I've got an audition. Mm? Uh I hope that this helped. Changed my day around. Oh, fine. Maybe I'll see you around. - Good luck on your audition. - Thank you. You're welcome. Meet me behind the station. I have something to show you. Yo. Yeah, we've... we've been shooting all night. Jayne busted into my party the other night, asking me about Star and the others. Nah, I didn't tell him shit. The asshole ruined my high. You gotta be cool, bro. There's some girls here. Yeah, I still got 'em, come on up. Okay, cool. Hey, yo, what... what are you doing here? You don't... you can't just come over to my office like this. Looking for Persi? All the way down to the left. Bye, Juicy. Hey. What is it, Jimmy? You're gonna wanna see this. What? You need to move your car before we get it towed. Yeah, I could move it. I could drive it right to the morgue. What are you talking about? Who's pulling the strings? Who could throw the body of a giant in a trunk without nobody seeing? Whoever did it, picked the locks in the parking lot on Franklin where they threw the body. In broad daylight? They did it sometime in the morning while I was having breakfast. You've been tracking my cell, you know I couldn't have done this. I don't know, buddy. I think somebody's seriously fucking with you, big time. Or warning me. Maybe they knew Kaiser was trying to help me. Yeah. Now don't you think the smart thing to do would have been to tell us about this when the Land Rover first tried to run you down? I've never been accused of being smart. Right. What about your visit to Persi's party? Persi had nothing to do with it. He's just a bad host. If I were you, I would check the people at the Chateau party, that's where I'd start. Sorry, buddy, afraid we have to keep the car. Okay. Well, don't scratch it. Don't fuck with the radio. No scratch, no problem. Who's driving me home? I'll drive you home. Hey, no smoking in the cruiser. It's regulations. All right, have a couple of puffs, I'll wait. What a fucking day, man. Yeah, me too. Persi's dead. Yeah, I know, a real loss to humanity. How'd he go? Snapped neck. Now look, I'm only gonna tell you this once, I don't think you're involved in this any more than somebody wants you to be. Okay. I'm next. I think you're right. How's that? You know something you don't even know you know. Or somebody wants you to know something, you know. Let's hit it. Put that out. So this how you live? Yeah, Dad left me the house. Mortgaged to get the shop, couldn't make the payment, closed, told the family moving in that this is a separate property. So what, they can kick you out anytime they want? I don't know, James. All right, concerned citizen, why don't you tell me who you think's involved? Flosso. Flosso? He's an ex-fighter. Huh. He'd certainly know how to break their necks clean enough. So this preacher's daughter, your source, she for certain it was him? Yeah, he's working for somebody. Well, that makes sense, 'cause Flosso, he's a real dumb shit. He wouldn't be able to do it on his own. I'll look him up, I'll see what I can find. Hey Vargas, how well you know your partner? Why you ask? 'Cause I think he's dirty. I think he found my lighter and thought I was an easy mark. You're reaching, buddy. And you better be careful what you're saying. He have an alibi? Matter of fact he does. He was half in the bag over at the Montello. How're the cameras at the Montello Lounge? - They're good. - Yeah? Yeah. If you check the video footage and you see him leaving between 2:00 and 2:30, then I was right. And if I'm right, I just wanna know about it. No. All right, no more cowboy shit. I'll take a look at the tapes, but I can already tell you what I'm gonna find, okay. And by the way, you're all wrong about Freeman. He's a good guy, he's my kid's godfather. Hitler loved dogs. Huh. What's your point? My point is some of the most evil people in the world still have great smiles. That's interesting. Just do me a favor. Stand down, all right. You done enough, okay? It's depressing. What's your name? Star. If you forget, just look up. The shit's vegan, right? Makeup? It's vegan? Go check. It's in my contract, vegan makeup! Don't fucking say anything, I'm mic'd. Okay, you know what it looks like... I'm fr... Shut the fuck up! Shut up! You lied to me. You lie to me again, I'll break your fucking face, you understand? - You understand? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Okay. Tell me about Persi. Fuck, man. I was embarrassed to admit that I was hanging with Persi 'cause he is a fucking scumbag, okay. But it's not illegal to drink his booze and eat his food, not to mention, fucking pussy flying around that place. I mean, anything goes there. Like what? Some local cops there hanging out now, playing poker in the back. That's not all that's going on back there. Yeah, I heard a few pimped some girls, but that's none of my fucking business. I had nothing to do with those dead hookers. Star and her friends, did they go to this party? Yeah, man, I said that, I seen them there a few times but there's 50 fucking girls there every night. You wanna talk to someone? Talk to Erasmus. Am I supposed to know who that is? Erasmus Alcindor. He's a screenwriter. He's a fucking hack, looks like a ferret. He used to date Star. Look, I don't know why they dated either, she's a fucking beautiful girl messing around with some fucking creep. He used to lie to her and say he'd put her in movies. He talks to that cop Flosso, all the time. Where can I find him? Erasmus? He lives in those shithole apartments in Persi's studios. I swear to fucking God, man. Fuck God, I swear to you, okay? He knows everything about their operation. Everything. I swear to you, I swear, I swear, I... Listen, listen, you little bitch. - You gonna lie to me again? - No. - You gonna lie to me again? - No, I'm not gonna lie again! No! Erasmus? Go away! Erasmus? Are you fucking deaf? He's not here. This can go one of two ways. You watch who you're throwing insults out of your word-hole to, you... you... the wrong person hears it, and you'll be in a fucking cheap hotel room dead, you hear me? Fuck, man. I'm a pacifist! I'm a pacifist! Fuck. I'm not. You going somewhere? Babylon has fallen, can't you see it's the last days of Rome? You want to know what I see? I see a piece of shit who's in way over his head who's gonna tell me all about his girlfriend. Which one? You know which one. Fucking Star. Star's not my girlfriend, you sperm-less testicle, she's my friend. Alright, women, I'm not a threat to them, they trust me, they bare their midnight fantasies, their hopes and dreams. Alright, I'm telling you that she was an angel! Star. They should've called her "The-Whole-fucking-Galaxy". Who killed her? It's not that simple, man. She was... it's not that simple. She was blackmailing us... them, them! That's not an admission of guilt. - She was blackmailing them. - Who? I tried to stop her, but she brought the others - in on it. - Who? All the girls, man. Persi used to run drugs up from Mexico. He had to find a way to launder the money, so he got in the film business and then he started trafficking girls, all the girls who wanna be in his movies. Didn't ask for a fucking resume. Tell me who killed Star. Flosso, man. They always used Flosso to keep the girls in line. Don't fucking lie to me. Don't fucking lie to me. Half the fucking precinct is in it, man. How you think they wear such nice suits? I want names. Goddammit, Flosso is a name! Flosso is a name. Who ordered the hit? Who ordered the hit! He'll kill me. I'll fucking kill you. Who ordered the hit? Freeman. - Detective... - Don't fucking lie to me, man. I'm telling the truth, man. I overheard him and Persi talking. It's... it's not killing women to them, man. It's more like clearing out rotten inventory. Like difficult women make bad hookers, man. And you were... you were the perfect fall guy. You screwed everything up, man. Now Flosso's in the wind and they want us all dead. How are you involved? Me, I'm just a writer, man. I schedule the girls. I make sure they have a good time. I take care of the girls, that's it. And Vargas? You seen him around? Freeman keeps him in the dark, man. Vargas is the worst detective in the city. I'm going to my mom's. I should have never left Glendale. Yeah. Just pulled up. What are you talking about? To the parlor. Rent here on Melrose must be outrageous. Wait, what? Jimmy, you just texted me 15 minutes ago - saying to meet you here. - No. No, hey run. Get out of there. Get the fuck out of there. Hey? Hey! - Vargas? - Hey, where are you, Jimmy? Freeman's mixed into this for sure. Yeah, fuck, I know that. Look, I just went to The Montello. They already handed over their tapes to guess who? Yeah. So listen, Star, she worked the concession stand at this old movie theatre. She sent an encrypted file to her boss. Forensics, they're trying to unlock it right now, okay. Hey, that source I told you about, the preacher's daughter, she somehow got a text from my phone. I was talking to her when she was abducted. Hold on, okay. We're gonna get an APB out. Also a bystander ID'd Flosso leaving the scene where Star and her friends were found. You understand that? You speak to your captain about the tapes? Look, I haven't talked to anybody yet. Where was she? She's right outside my shop. Okay, listen, I'm gonna roll units over right now. Do not go inside, Jimmy. - You hear me? - Oh no. Do not engage. Okay. Okay. Cuff him. Fuck you! Farry. Captain. You alone? - Yeah, what's going on? - All right. It's Freeman, gotta bring him in. He's dirty. Just busted Flosso. He was trying to kill a witness. Got it? Fuck, he just left. What's your hurry, Bill? So stupid. Where they take her? I don't know. I could drive this thing into the Pacific, or you can give me an exact address. You're gonna die anyways. Now you can lie to me, I can make it real slow, or you can tell me the truth and maybe I'll make it fast. Maybe. I didn't want any of this. It was Freeman. Fucking Freeman caught me with a gram. One gram. Told me he'd get IA to take my badge away and put me away for three years if I didn't work for him. You killed Star? Yeah, I did. Where's Eleanor? San Diego. They got a restaurant, a fridge leads to a tunnel. What's this tunnel? The kind of tunnel that connects San Diego with Tijuana. Freeman runnin' the operation? Fuck no. It's some broker, Dr. Feelgood. He's a dangerous cat though, man. He's got eyes everywhere. - Hey. - Hmm. I tell you where they are, I'll take you to 'em, you gotta let me go. It's a fair trade, right? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. - Hey! - Stop that car! Hey! Okay, took a left. I told you to be ready. I do not work to your schedule, detective. Where's Flosso? As soon as we get safe, he's next. She's doped up and ready for transport. Buyers pay well for American girls, age aside. Just make sure I get my cut. This the place? Yeah. Fridge's in the back. Now you're gonna let me go, right? Man of your word. Yeah. Stop, stop! Stop! In here! Freeman, you prick! Hey, I can get you whatever you want. Money, girls. You motherfucker. You know the damage you've done? I have an idea. I have a family. I worked for my life. Kill! Hey, hey. Don't... don't... don't... don't you do it! You motherfucker. Jimmy. It's okay. Wasn't supposed to... ...to end like this. Say hi to my mom. Please don't do it. Not this way. I'm sorry, Jimmy. Who is that? Identify yourself! Identify yourself! Where's Freeman? Huh? Where's Freeman? What happened out there? Your son's gonna need a new godfather. What are the three words to ruin a man's ego? Is it in? - I know it's funny. - Yeah, no. - 'Cause it's true. - I bet, I bet. Where you from? Very far away from here. You here for the movies? Real movies. But I just arrived. I worked in a theatre, but they don't show the kinda movies I'm in now. Oh? The theatre manager was such a nice guy. Not like my new bosses. They are, how do you say... pigs. You like that work? No. Can you work a front desk? Can you type? Why? My secretary left with my business partner. - Things happen. - Things happen. Things happen. Be there tomorrow, you got a job. I mean no pressure. Jimmy Jayne. Jimmy Jayne. Thanks for being such a good guy. I don't know about that. Persi wants us. He has a car outside already. Yeah. Hey, what's your name? Star. If you forget, just look up. Hey. Bye Star. Star... Thank you.
