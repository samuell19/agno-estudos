Are they there again? Is it one of your cars? Not my department I don't deal with VIPs But you're being followed By his department? But why? There must be an explanation They're not being discreet either What do you want with me? It's started again - How long? - Three days - Are you sure? - They're there now Coming! Why do you think it's Security? If it isn't, I have a right to some protection Here are the registration numbers Get Pavel It's not just me, you know They're after all of us International Brigade veterans I'm fed up Why not confront me with Noel Field? I know he's in prison in Hungary Who's behind all this? It's aimed at Spanish Civil War veterans and those in France or London during the occupation You too Even if you are with Security Loebl, Pavlik and Feigl held major posts, too, and they're in prison now He's undersecretary of the Interior and he's sent back to party school Otto has been dismissed too Today it's my turn And tomorrow? Whose turn will it be? Are they Security cars? Then you'd better find out who's giving the orders in your department If it's who I think, it could be dangerous - Don't they know? - Better not Why? It concerns them too, doesn't it? - You came together? - We met by chance Some chance, when all Spanish Civil War veterans are being watched It's going to look like a meeting You and your surveillance Things are difficult, but nobody's watching me You lost your job Sling's in prison I've been sent to the party school for a course on the dialectics of the class struggle in socialist construction The undersecretary is being followed without the head of security's knowledge Shoemakers are always the worst shod Why not resign? Leave your job, confess your errors They won't let me, yet they cut me out Type this for the departmental meeting It was this morning What's going on? The minister said your presence wasn't necessary And you all believed him? I don't believe, these days I just wonder where it will all end The party decides All misunderstandings can be resolved by the party Unless it's higher up I thought it was about the Field affair, but Bedrich says it isn't The Field affair is settled The party secretary This meeting is pointless It's me again Gérard insists He thinks it's very important He's very busy He'll call you For the party, the matter is settled But you know what Security is like, refusing to let go Still, you have friends there The head of Security, for instance And he's pretty embarrassed, as he knew Field too We'll have our own Rajk trial soon No, the circumstances were different They're just the same Here, too, we are discovering spies, traitors, Titoists You spoke to my successor? His new minister - He seems to believe it all Your dossier is growing fast We haven't heard the end of this yet It has ramifications everywhere: Poland, Germany It's him you ought to see Let's go They won't believe we met to chat over old days in Spain Starting to feel guilty already, eh? Don't forget "Both donkey and master are safest when furthest away" They're still there I'll ask the minister to see you Gerard wants to talk to you He's very concerned I'll see him tomorrow morning Tell him the Field affair hasn't done him any good Dozens of comrades had contact with Noel Field during the occupation - We haven't found the enemy in our ranks We knew that death and betrayal were inseparable from revolution It's our turn to experience betrayal and death so that the revolution may continue That's what's important - that it continue, even if we are destroyed Go and see him tomorrow What else should I do? Nothing Have faith in the party Who is it? You the Frenchwoman? Someday your husband will hang Who was that? Nothing A wrong number Who are you? What do you want? Let go of me! Who are you? Shut up! The handcuffs I demand to see a party representative Shut up You're not demanding anything Who are you? I want to see - - Shut up! Undress him Put it on Bills, various papers Cuff links, pen Take 'em off! 350 crowns Two party cards Family photographs Here's the Frenchwoman - Inform my family She'll think you've run off Darex vouchers Worth 1,200 crowns He uses the foreign diplomats' store Everyone makes sacrifices for socialism, but he lives like a bourgeois Leave those alone! Your number is 3225 Don't forget it Start walking! No sitting or standing still Keep walking! The party's always right There must be a misunderstanding The truth will come out, but you must submit to the rules, even if it's hard At least to show good faith You'll get the same whenever you stop! Walk! Walk! Food! No food for him Walk Did you see Gérard this afternoon? He didn't come by? Did you see Gérard this afternoon? He didn't come by? Is Zavodsky there? Excuse me - Police search - What's the matter? What's the matter? My children are asleep up there What's the meaning of this? We have orders to search the place I have a direct line to the Central Committee. I'll inform the secretary. We'll see what he has to say - Have you got a warrant? - We don't need one I told you We have orders to search And I tell you, not without a warrant Go up to bed, Mother You stay here, madam My eldest son He was born in prison In France At La Roquette A prison in Paris Why were you there? Because that's what the Germans did to communists in 1942 Being pregnant, I escaped execution - Were you in prison long? - No, I was deported to Ravensbruck My son was the youngest political prisoner in France My husband was sent to Mauthausen "Night and Fog" Do you know what that means? Those are photos of my husband in the Spanish Civil War and the French Resistance Put that away It's only my daughter Evening, honey - Isn't Daddy here? - He'll be here soon They're colleagues of his Did you have a nice time at your party? Go to bed quickly and see that the little ones are asleep Some coffee? Police search! You're behaving like the Nazis! I didn't see the warrant Go to work as usual Not a word about this - May I speak to the minister? - At 5:00 am? After the school, we'll go to the Ministry They took nothing important Letters, papers, photos Fifteen years of life together Souvenirs of Spain, prison letters Gerard never kept official papers at home We'll take care of it Call me anytime on the direct line He missed an appointment He needs weekly treatment for his lung problem We'll take care of it He is merely in isolation Nothing's changed for you and your family The Ministry car and chauffeur are at your disposal, as usual Did you see the minister? Yes, Gérard hasn't been arrested He's simply in isolation until certain problems have been cleared up They need his help It's a serious, confidential party matter So long as he has a chance to explain I feared the worst Let me know if I can help He told me nothing had changed I'll be looking after you from now on Here is your car Let's hear you! What are your requests and complaints? I want to see a party official Identify yourself! Undersecretary of- You're nobody! What's your number? Number! You're 3225 We'll be back when you know that Walk! Put these back on Don't stand still! Keep walking! You're here to confess your crimes You must confess Confess what? Who are you? Date - February 1 Confess Admit who you are I'm the undersecretary of Foreign - You're a number What is it? - Your number? - 3225 What am I accused of? You know very well There's a name for men like you What's your name? - The party knows my - Don't invoke the party Never invoke the party You're hereto confess, and you will I want to see an official - Confess what? - Confess! - Be specific - You'll confess - I want to see an official I'll make you confess At first we tried to aid the party, to help it see things clearly To understand ourselves and the mistakes that had brought us there We were prepared to admit that our mistakes may have harmed the party The years of discipline, our whole education, led us to believe that the party was never wrong, that the USSR was always right We aren't acting alone We have advisers! In all humility, we felt it better to err with the party than be right as individuals You must confess! Confess what? Ask me specific questions Eat! Enough eating Walk! That's enough Start walking! Walk! Stand up! You will not maintain this hostility You will obey! Please, is it day or night? You're here for a very serious reason The party ordered your arrest We are entrusted with your interrogation concerning international espionage and treason against the Soviet Union and our country Your duty is to help us establish the truth You are not the only one involved Other important people are implicated in this affair You alone can help yourself You have been in the party a long time I appeal to you to help the Soviet Union and our party Anything to say? I have constantly demanded a hearing by the party Ask me anything Very well, we shall draw up a report Tuesday, February 4 I declare - When did you establish contact with American intelligence? How were you recruited by the American spy Noel Field? Have you collaborated with American spies in addition to Noel Field? Never! No one! Silence! Answer the questions! Heads will roll We have all the proof we need We have methods you never dreamed of You will confess Your choice is either to try to redeem yourself by making a full confession or to remain an enemy unto death of the Soviet Union and our party So answer the questions Enough! Hand over the bowl! Enough! Keep walking! You can sleep now On your back, regulation position Arms straight Stand up! Your number? You can sleep now Stand up! Your number? You can sleep now Get up! Your number? You must obey orders You and your filthy race, you're all alike We'll finish what the gas chambers started You say that, wearing the party insignia? Don't moralize to me, you traitor! You thought you controlled the party, but you've all been expelled You're lying! That's impossible It's against the rules of the party What's this bourgeois conception of democracy? The Central Committee can assume emergency powers Look at these cards You, Vales, Zavodsky, who was head of Security We know about your criminal activities in Spain and France thanks to our advisers We'll track down the others and expel them too You're not the Central Committee We're above the Central Committee Our task is to unmask traitors, even within the Committee We represent the power of the proletariat Your friends who protected you have talked You will talk too You will answer these comrades' questions Like Zavodsky, who has made a full confession As head of Security, he knew it was the only way to save himself Zavodsky? Confess? But confess what? You recently attended a clandestine meeting Why? You called the meeting! You led this Trotskyist group from the International Brigades What decisions did you make? You expressed your Trotskyist opinions in Spain? What did you do? Sectarian sabotage? You met Rajk in Spain? Was he your contact with American intelligence? Rajk was executed as a spy in Hungary You know what to expect The Polish traitors Rwal and Winkler? Why did you protect the Titoist Dapchevich in Spain? Your only chance to save yourself is to confess even more fully than the others You are the leader Here we uproot weeds before they spread You knew Rajk in Spain So he put you in contact with the Americans You were with Bartos in Spain What do you know of him? We know he deserted Jares was in your unit. Do you remember? This report describes him as a suspect Trotskyist element Like all your friends, here and abroad My connections were with the French and Italian communist parties Who said all this? We have everything fully documented in this matter Thanks to our Soviet advisers, we have full details of your espionage network Zavodsky's confession He describes in detail the criminal activities of your Trotskyist group It's not true Zavodsky couldn't have Isn't that his signature? Each page is signed! It isn't possible Not at Marseille Yes, it is “My activity for the Americans in Marseille" I presume you recognize his writing? Zavodsky and the rest pulled the wool over your eyes To show good faith and help the party, you must confess everything Confess what? That I was a spy? Your view of things is too subjective Zavodsky was arrested after you He confessed immediately He knows it's the only way out But it's all untrue The French Communist Party and the Resistance can bear me out It's no use We have other confessions saying the same thing Here everyone confesses, believe me You were their leader It's your only chance Think of what might happen to your family Listen "I spied for the Americans in order to overthrow the regime In this criminal activity, I was directed by" - Look Your name, in black and white What can you do against that? Thirsty? A man confesses to serious crimes committed on your command In court, what will be believed? Your denials or his self-incrimination? He's still talking too - Lies It's the confession that counts Why is he risking his life by making these confessions? To save his life, do you understand? I want to help the party, but I can't- I forbid you to speak of the party And I forbid you to give this traitor anything to drink Abandoned by the party, comrades, no one would doubt my guilt I myself never doubted the Moscow and Rajk trials How could any communist believe that the infallible party was capable of making the innocent confess? Confess what, why? We will use any method to uncover your treason Zavodsky says he knew of your American activities, but remained silent because you knew of his Gestapo connections Your friend Vales admits to having collaborated with the British police Though Jewish, you survived the concentration camps Why? Because you collaborated The Americans recruited you through captured Gestapo files Walk! The party is informed of cooperative attitudes in prisoners 3225 Present Louder! What did you do? Why are you here? I don't know They won't let me sleep And it stinks Nothing to eat or drink I'm innocent Wait We've had orders about you You're a special case Don't tell anyone, or I'll be punished I want to see a party official You're committing a crime For 10 days I haven't slept, eaten or drunk I want to be questioned officially, with my answers recorded You haven't slept or eaten? I'll see about that The guards tend to do as they like We've got Holdos now All you veterans of Spain are in the bag Here - in Hungary, Poland, Germany All the international Brigades are implicated in this affair Rajk was asked exactly the same questions at his trial His case seems to interest you But, of course, his confessions brought you closer to discovery You approved of his trial to conceal yourselves We shall act as the Hungarians did in liquidating Rajk and his gang I propose a resolution condemning the spy and traitor Laszlo Rajk, unmasked by our Hungarian comrades All in favor, raise their hands Many veterans of Spain are implicated There weren't only us good guys in Spain Can't see the forest for the trees To sum up then "I have committed certain errors in my work through my negligence I have had dealings with Kohnova, Vasela, Pavlik and Feigl, already convicted for their dealings with Field" Vasela wasn't convicted She killed herself during the trial Not Vasela then "I accepted American imperialist money for my underground party work" Sign it Isn't it better this way? You can sleep now I retract I only signed under physical coercion - What? - Yes, physical coercion So you think this is a confession? We haven't even begun You'll sign much more than that Let's start again He'll speak, or we'll finish the matter by finishing him Come on, start with your life Walk Tell me your story from the beginning Date of birth? February 1, 1915, at Ostrava My father was a railroad man Why aren't you called by your real name? Gerard was my name in the French Resistance French Resistance - how odd You are a communist and a Jew, yet you survived the Gestapo Bizarre Carry on - My son was born in prison His mother named him Gérard, not knowing if we'd ever meet again Don't try to make me cry Carry on My father was the fifth of eight children, son of a railroad man in Moravia under Austro-Hungarian rule Then he went to Switzerland and in about 1900 emigrated to America He learned English very quickly He could recite Whitman's poems by heart and pages of Paine and Jefferson In New York he met my mother, also an émigré They came back home together In the First World War, he was a stretcher-bearer Through contact with Russian prisoners, he learned about Bolshevism From him I first heard of Rosa Luxemburg, the Spartacists, Lenin, the Commune of Canton It was he who made me read Heinrich Heine He pointed my way into the Communist Youth In 1930 we wanted to blow up the Ostrava prefecture Well, did you blow it up or not? Last night, you told my colleague you did No, we were only 15 We merely dreamed of doing a daring deed Dreamed? This morning, you told me the opposite So you have three different versions of that story? Start again from the beginning Let's see if you have a fourth I'm listening I was born in Ostrava - You say your friend Wagner disappeared in Moscow in 1935 Yesterday you didn't know what had become of him Which is it? Start again I met Wagner in Moscow when - No, from the beginning Date of birth? Carry on You said your father made you read "Enrich N", What next? Heinrich Heine He pointed my way into the Communist Youth He was incensed by the Sacco and Vanzetti case We demonstrated together He respected Bakunin's physical courage and admired Kropotkin, all of whose writing he knew But he did not share the basic anarchist ideology An old member of the socialist left, he became a founding member of the communist party in his hometown Outcast by polite society and by the Jewish community who thought him a traitor because he was an atheist and supporter of anti-religious organizations, he found it hard to get work His family didn't help Except my uncle Zigmund, who never tired of lecturing him I saw my father for the last time in Moscow in the summer of 1935 He had aged considerably In order to visit us, he arranged to come on a trip - on an organized trip with other people who were with him He wanted to meet my wife Everything interested him Sometimes he asked questions which I had difficulty answering which I had difficulty answering He disliked some things in Moscow There were things he didn't understand But he had fulfilled his dream of seeing the Red Square and Lenin in his mausoleum When he left, he was sad He wondered when we would meet again I never saw him again Nor my mother, my brother Jean or my sister Juliette They died in concentration camps We are in a 200-foot-square office with a gray-green cabinet A typewriter An empty beer glass, a cup of coffee Filthy traitor! Get out, you! You'll account for this Let's finish this You filthy Trotskyist bandit You had already begun your activities in Moscow Go on! They're going to hang me Kill him if he won't talk! I'll disappear like Wagner in Moscow They confiscated my card They say I'm a Trotskyist! They'll say my conscience drove me to suicide Suicide He didn't have the courage to confess You're in luck, but you'll hang anyway, and our people will be avenged If it's who I think, it's dangerous Our advisers want you alive for the trial They want us to grant diplomatic status to Soviet advisers But they're policemen We benefit from their experience of the Moscow trials The presence of these advisers seemed to us a natural consequence of Soviet aid to socialist countries I have five months to make you confess Radek held out for three That's the record, so I have time to spare Each night someone goes missing They're preparing a major trial Confess, or you'll be tried secretly You'll be hanged Finally, they found a discrepancy in my various biographical accounts Admit you're a Trotskyist! Admit it! You were in touch with Trotskyist spies in Moscow in 1936 To avoid discovery, you went to Spain Wagner worked for the Comintern for years He came to see me in my Moscow hotel Because of this lapse, they took away everything - my party card, my job, my room Stalin can't possibly know Stalin can't possibly know Look, he's starting to break Look at this beautiful phrase starting to break A quotation haunted me "The individual becomes guilty not because he is guilty, but because he may be thought so" Look at this beautiful phrase "This is what I have to say about the Trotskyist group of International Brigade volunteers" Now we can really get to work Your friend, Tonda All misunderstandings can be resolved by the party Your friend's talking about a Trotskyist group Three weeks - no sleep, practically no food He's confessed everything - It's not signed - It's the carbon That's fine, but what our friends want is "Trotskyist espionage organization" Get him to sign that You'll be signing, too, since you're their leader Our party comrades will stop you Did you help us? It's unthinkable that the party - He's raving Stalin knows what he's doing What should I do? - Confess! - What? That I spied? Stalin knows what he's doing What should I do? He's had it Stalin says the most precious capital is man If he's drowning, he must be helped Eat I heard Smola say, "Leave him for a moment" Lying there, I had a wonderful vision of myself on a Monte Carlo beach where I'd never been When I arrived in France, the first thing I did was come here The doctor advised it for my lungs - Tell it all - What? The whole story - Who to? - Write a book I know some publishers - Who for? - For us Communists aren't ready for this kind of truth They'll say that dirty linen should be washed in private Or that there's no smoke without fire, that I didn't have the true party spirit It's too soon objectively Write it anyway They're still in power They wouldn't let it be published Publish in France No, there first Such a book should spring from changing circumstances So you'll say nothing? I have no personal grudges It's a general problem Precisely Who will speak for the dead? Who spoke up for us at the trial in 1952? Did you? Do you remember what you said? That we were mad dogs, Titoist spies, Trotskyist bandits You all knew about my activities in France But no one spoke Did you? No - Why? - I'd have been expelled That's too easy Did you think they were guilty? We didn't have enough information until 1956, the 20th Congress The bourgeois press, as you call it, could have told you it was trumped up But you were living in a closed world with the party as God Apart from details, your story tells me nothing new The existence of this hellish mechanism was known One politician said that hell, as the Prague trials remind us, has its own logic He also had a nice turn of phrase to justify the wars in Indochina and Algeria, with their million dead Anyway, all this explains how but not why Stalin eliminated the best, the most brilliant Stalin, who wasn't alone, was once a seminarian Public confession, humiliation of the sinner Also, he was infallible During the cold war, there were rifts between the People's Democracies They had been born not of true revolution, but of Soviet military successes There were serious economic and societal problems Stalin did not like independent socialist powers Tito would not blindly copy Russian-style socialism Tito was declared an agent of imperialism "Titoist" became a synonym for "spy" Just as Trotskyist had previously So? So, after the Rajk trial, the party agreed to Soviet advisers I consider this a proof of trust You will work as a group under the direction of our comrade advisers You will be answerable only to them, the president of the Republic and the secretary of the party The party has no power to interfere with this activity At the end of February, I was again transferred No, these cars are too modern In 1951, it was the Tatra plan with the rear fin Being in an ordinary prison again gave me hope You can lie down You'd take fright if you could see yourself Today's March 6 For 35 days, you have refused to cooperate Your negative attitude is reported to the party every day Right We'll start at the beginning again On condition that- Conditions? Your life is at stake! Your only chance is to confess everything Take him away Prepare yourself for interrogation You have four hours' sleep Remove your jacket Regulation position You must confess your guilt As an obedient member of the party, you must submit If I am not a good communist, but a Trotskyist spy, why appeal to my loyalty? If I'm a good communist, why am I here? Telephone, sir Keep an eye on him It's him in the corridor How weary he must be His fate's sealed And what about mine? A few years in a state farm till this blows over Zavodsky was executed in 1954, after the others We've received a letter from your wife "It isn't easy to support a family, of course, but with the help of the party, I'll manage" She has the right spirit She has repudiated you Why so surprised? It isn't the first time One of your friends has confessed that she was his mistress You bastard! It's all in here! Imbecile! They're a fine lot, your Trotskyist friends! I know she's French, but him! They were caught in his office She was leaning against his shoulder "In that case, you had intimate relations with her?" Answer: "Not intimate, just very friendly" Question: "Was she leaning against your shoulder?" Answer: "Yes" "According to the dictionary, that means you were intimate" Answer: "All right, intimate then" He confessed she was his mistress Who dreamed all that up? Guess! What concerns us is that she has repudiated you and placed herself in the party's hands - ls there new information? - Every day Send me all documents about Gérard I want to see them first What's happening to my husband? You write too many letters Our comrades have better things to do than read them However, I was instructed to see you What do you want? To know what's happened It's been two months He seems to be deeply implicated All this is about him But is he under arrest or not? I have a right to know, as his wife and a party member He has not been charged, but there are matters to clear up I've shared his life for 16 years It's an open book A man may seem open, then one day secrets emerge - Not him - Because you love him There have always been traitors, agents provocateurs, cops in the workers' movement The wives never unmask them In 1941, in your party, you had to execute the national organizer Gitton, you mean He'd been a police informer for years The national organizer Hasn't he been acting strange lately? Leaving you alone, coming home late? Was he arrested - put in isolation for his private life? I've already said he hasn't been charged You should go back to France with your family You mean I should be the first to condemn him? I won't believe he's guilty until he tells me so Life will be difficult for you I regret to say you can't go on working for the radio now Why? They said I'm the best reporter in the French service You'll have to work in a factory instead of in public service ls the factory a punishment? How sad for the workers in a workers' state That is how things are managed in the Soviet Union They're taking our things I couldn't stop them What are you doing? Here's your paper, Father What's going on? The minister's orders The villa is needed We're moving you - Where to? Here it is It could have been worse You could put the children here Who's that lady? A friend Her brother's with Daddy We'll be working together ls her brother in prison, like Daddy? - Who told you that? - Everyone at school says so You are Londonova? Yes You know my husband? I've heard of him through friends Well, I need a job rather urgently I've no skills No matter We'll teach you - And you? - I've found a job at Autorenova That's right next door You'll be neighbors You can start at the end of the month, if you like I'd like that Thank you - We'd like to be together - If possible I'll try to arrange it Come over here! - I frightened them off - No, you didn't Yes, I did I'm used to it now Did you see they've arrested the party secretary? How far will they go? I wrote to him about Gérard, but he refused to see me Well, it's over now This arrest makes everything clear HOW? At my paper, they say he's responsible for all the arrests it's a purge against those who criticized his economic policy Even I had my share of persecution Gerard will be freed soon You'll see He was the party newspaper editor Soon he was arrested too He confessed, became one of the 14 accused and was executed Here he is I wish you much joy Sit down In six months, you've worn out around a dozen interrogators You even made the commandant lose his patience But never mind, it doesn't matter We'll start from the beginning, all over again We have plenty of interrogators and lots of time You'll confess, even if it takes a year or more I have five months So I'm in no hurry You have no idea what awaits you Put these on Get up, please Walk Later I learned that during the Nazi occupation, and before, Kohoutek had been in charge of police anticommunist work "I had dealings with Noel Field in Geneva in 1947" Sign it, please But the party knows that So much the better Sign The party knows about this "For these dealings, Noel Field paid me the sum of" - How much? Not "for these dealings" but "during these dealings" It was to pay my sanatorium expenses The party knew Who said it didn't? So he gave you money? - Yes - How much? I don't remember It was five years ago Walk It wasn't for any dealings I had contracted tuberculosis in the concentration camp The party knew of Field's welfare service for deportees Go on How much did Field give you? 300 Swiss francs? More? Less? - More - How much? Double, or more Face the wall 800 francs, say? Now we're getting the facts That's what I want "In 1947"- Come closer "Noel Field paid me the sum of 800 Swiss francs" Sign, please - But the party knows - Go ahead Szony, condemned to death in the Rajk trial, got only 300 francs But mine - Were for the sanatorium No one denies that "In 1947, in Switzerland, I had dealings with the American spy, Noel Field" Sign it No In 1947, I didn't know Field was a spy ls Noel Field an American spy? Didn't the Rajk trial establish that Field was an American spy? This resolution voted by the party condemns the traitor Rajk Did you sign the resolution? - As a cover- - No! Did the Rajk trial establish that Field was a spy in 1947? Yes But in 1947, we didn't know he was a spy Let's say that in 1947 you had dealings with a spy unmasked in 1949? Say it then "In 1947, in Switzerland, I had dealings with the American spy, Noel Field" Yes, but in 1947 I couldn't know what would be discovered in 1949 No one could foresee in 1947 that Field was a spy Very good Let us now consider each fact objectively Later we shall consider the subjective aspect Noel Field was an American spy You had dealings with him I did, because - - What dealings? - I did, because - Espionage Espionage dealings - Certainly not - Admit it No I was ill and penniless, so I got in touch with Field's welfare service I am not a social worker How did you establish espionage contact with Field? It wasn't espionage You signed these statements "In 1947, in Switzerland, I had dealings with the American spy, Noel Field" "In 1947, Noel Field paid me the sum of 800 Swiss francs" Reconcile these facts Why should an American spy pay a communist official's expenses? We are simply considering the facts As I said, the subjective aspects will be dealt with at a later stage "In 1947, I had dealings with Noel Field As he is an American spy" - I've put it as favorably as I can - "and I had dealings with him, I am objectively guilty of espionage During this time, Field paid me 800 Swiss francs" Sign, please As you see, I have eliminated subjective conditions Oh, excuse me The carbon too That one is for translation For our comrade advisers I was forgetting Here's a letter from your wife Then you can sleep a while Regulation position Sit down There's a little additional signature required "The International Brigade volunteers are self-confessed Trotskyists and traitors Objectively, therefore, as their leader, so am I" Sign, please After signing, you may write to your family "In the Communist Youth, I had already worked under Smirkovsky, whose Trotskyist past is well known" I never said that About working with him? About him being a Trotskyist He said that himself Recognize his hand? It's his all right You're merely confirming his confession We and our advisers believe you were a Trotskyist before Spain Why should you? Type this In 1936, you gave shelter in your Moscow hotel to a man called Wagner, a Trotskyist expelled from the party You expressed doubts about the Moscow trials I must insert something about this Come here "In Moscow, I lived in a hotel where Trotskyists had been arrested" The president and the secretary of the party will be pleased They lived there too Exactly The secretary of the - The ex-secretary of the party is here Don't start raising your hopes That won't exonerate you On the contrary, it proves that you all got important posts to seize power on behalf of American imperialism So you say No, so he has started saying, and you will confirm what he says I won't sign You will like the rest Do you think this arrest was made lightly? The secretary corresponded with the Englishman Zilliacus by diplomatic pouch through your office How often? - It concerned the peace movement - Zilliacus was a spy Add this "I received and transmitted" - How many letters? Four? Five? No, two "Five letters" I'll have this translated You can sign after Put them on And keep walking It's been translated Now you can sign Then you can sleep What the - It isn't the same Let me read it Read the copy It's not the same It is You're tired - There was no carbon - There was - No - Sleep now From certain testimonies - yours and others - you evidently betrayed the clandestine Central Committee to the Gestapo, indirectly occasioning the execution of Fucik Testimonies? What's all this filthy nonsense? We must synthesize all this material You said, "I organized Klecan's repatriation from France" He was in your Trotskyist group in Spain And you were the leader of these Trotskyists - I had instructions - - Sit down I had instructions Klecan was interned in France We got him out and supplied him with papers to go home And Klecan betrayed Fucik and the Central Committee Under torture Were you there? - Hearsay - Unproven Members of your group overheard you order Klecan to betray the Committee - Klecan - - We have their testimonies Forget the Central Committee Reicin has signed a statement about that Change them "In Spain, I admired the anarchist leaders more than the party's" I won't sign that I admired leaders like La Pasionaria, Durruti - Walk You were told to walk! We've wasted several days on this affair I've put off my departure to clear things up Given your anarchist activities as a youth - - I had none - You wanted to blow up a building I was 15 The formative age It's only a formality Handcuffs Not grounds for indictment These are merely administrative reports The party can be severe or lenient, irrespective of testimony Trust in the party It's your only chance I'll have earned my leave anyway "In Spain, I knew the Titoist Dapchevich" You admitted that I said I knew him, but also Luigi Longo, Pajetta, André Marty - Face the wall We're not concerned with them yet I never mentioned the word Titoist It's not a word It's a political concept defining our enemies But in Spain, in 1937, they were Yugoslav communists, not Titoists An ex-undersecretary too You don't know the ABC's of dialectics The past must be judged in the light of truths established today Do you know what Titoism is? Say it I approved the denunciation of Titoism Then don't go back on it! As Tito's minister, Dapchevich is a Titoist There'll be no sleep for you until you sign this - How was your leave? - I'm back on form Good The way things are going - Always splitting hairs Easy to see he's a Jew How sensible of you to advise your wife to return to France It's best for her Have you seen her? Why? Didn't you write to her? Sit down The party requires a report synthesizing all of this and reflecting your activities as a whole To save time, our comrade advisers have worked on this project - So I'm doomed - Not at all The report is for internal use, not for the courts Look, your fellow accused have already signed, and theirs are more serious "In 1947, in Geneva, I had espionage dealings with the known American spy, Field In return for information given, he paid me 800 Swiss francs" In return for information given? But that's impossible The party approved the formulation Do likewise Show you're a good communist And say I'm a Trotskyist spy? Because you are still a communist, you have been able to confess Confession is the highest form of self-criticism And self-criticism is the principal virtue of a communist They want corrections It's your friend Hajdu. Put "Zionist" instead of "Trotskyist" He's a Jew, not a Zionist In a People's Democracy, "Jew" is an insult We'll say Zionist Zionist is a political concept "Jew" is forbidden in Russia They say "Hebrew" Say "Hebrew" then "Zionist" isn't the same "Hebrew" doesn't sound as good Anyhow, the order is to say "Zionist" Right Let us continue No, wait This is the report for the prosecution Afterwards, you can dictate one for the defense There never was any dossier for the defense Through repetition, words like Trotskyist or Titoist lose all meaning I'd have signed a statement saying "my one-year-old Trotskyist son" The only solution was suicide I tried twice And yet you're still a communist I don't understand No, I do It's faith You are believers who dislike the church Which one? There are several And God is dead, so one can be a communist What happened to Field? He reappeared in Hungary in 1955, released and rehabilitated He doesn't want to return to the West What was he? An American agent or a Russian agent? Wait for his memoirs But why him? After the Spanish war, he ran an American aid service for refugees in Marseille and Geneva It was there that he helped dozens of communists He also had contact with Allen Dulles's American intelligence service in Switzerland America and Russia were allies against Hitler Then came the cold war The Americans got rid of Field for knowing communists The Russians passed him off as an American agent You were saying, after 20 months in prison - You must learn questions and answers by heart Take him away Put the blindfold on "Question: Have you told all about your conspiracy against the state?" "Yes, I have held nothing back I confess my participation in the conspiracy" Say your lines when he stops talking, just as we rehearsed - There you are - He knows his lines Take that off You don't look well How often do you exercise outside? Never in 21 months Never? Luckily it's almost over now It hasn't always been easy Put that back on You are going to see your leader and accomplices The party requires a report on this confrontation Remove the blindfold Sit down Zilliacus made frequent trips to the People's Democracies He was in contact with me here, with Gomulka in Poland, with Tito and his Fascist clique in Yugoslavia, with Rajk in Hungary, with Kostov in Bulgaria So we eventually found ourselves in the same trap The party secretary who had ordered the arrests and the minister of Security who planned the proceedings with the Soviet advisers I created the center of conspiracy against the state I learned later that the secretary had tried to commit suicide Padded walls prevented him from battering his head again Next time he was alone, he shut the door and tried to hang himself The man who found him just in time was later decorated For official posts, I appointed men who had lived in the West such as Bedrich Geminder, Josef Pavel, Karel Svab and the undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Why retract here? No one will know The party requires a report on this confrontation Retraction means no hearing Survive to speak at the trial You've signed all this I was part of the conspiracy against the state led by the party secretary I headed the Trotskyist group at the Foreign Office - Stick to your lines like that and you'll be able to appear at the public trial Slansky claims his role was limited to ideological leadership So did Bukharin in Moscow, but it cost him his life Learn all that now He'll help you out Prosecutor: "How many espionage letters did you forward to Zilliacus?" Answer Two, maybe five I deliberately kept no records Prosecutor: "Be more precise Mention's been made of 10 letters" Answer There may have been 10 Your injection It's calcium That warms you up, doesn't it? You're as white as chalk We'll have to fix that Guided by my bourgeois instinct, to further my career- Guided by my bourgeois instinct and to further - No "Selfish" Bourgeois and selfish Guided by my bourgeois and selfish instinct, to further my career, I became a cosmopolitan while in the West and defected to the bourgeois camp That's very good No, it's not good at all The text is all right But you'll never convince anybody you're guilty like that Learn these 15 pages by Thursday You'll have to put in some more sincerity You're lucky to be in this trial You aren't the main defendant now - For the injection? - Yes, only five more That'll give him a bit of color Take that off Dr Novak, president of the State Tribunal Have you any previous convictions? Two In 1931-1933 and in Paris in 1942 For what reasons? The first was for communist activity The second was for anti-Nazi activity Don't note that Have you a lawyer? I don't want one It's the law The state will appoint one Dr Ruzick, your lawyer Despite the seriousness of your position, I see that the state is spoiling you Stuffing me, you mean, like a goose - Pardon me? - My position is serious? You risk the death penalty That is the punishment you have earned by law Your only hope of a lighter sentence is to plead guilty and behave well in court What was your role in the conspiracy? I confess that I furthered espionage relations between the party secretary and the British agent, Zilliacus, by using the diplomatic pouch I myself maintained espionage relations with the American agent, Field I've just spoken to the prosecutor In his opinion, your case is the least serious A maximum of 15 years I told you, you're lucky to be in this trial But you must behave well, or your family will suffer The minister of Security wants to see you I appeal to you in the name of the party and the president Stick to your statement in court You will do the party a great service The situation is serious, war threatens The party expects you to be guided by its interests It'll be held in your favor Your family will not suffer the consequences of this trial The evening before the trial, they brought me a new suit from home Don't forget the tie - These ones? - Yes - Will he be freed soon? - I don't know, madam Is he coming home? They fetched my brother's things too Maybe they'll be home tonight Off to school, children SAVE SACCO AND VANZETTI We tater learned that, since conditions were icy, the ashes of the executed men were simply scattered on the roads The driver had his little joke Fourteen people in one car! Us and the 11 in the sacks! The court is in session Accused, has the delay stipulated by law to precede your appearance been respected? I advise the accused to follow the indictment and proceedings closely I ask them to benefit from their right to express opinions I remind them of their right to defend themselves as they see fit The public prosecutor The inquiry conducted by the minister of Security has established that, after the Second World War, in an attempt to secure world domination, the American imperialists organized a conspiracy against peace They created clandestine centers in the People's Democracies composed of corrupt elements I accuse them as traitors, Trotskyists, Titoists, Zionists and enemies of the people of conspiring in the service of the American imperialists and under the leadership of Western intelligence agencies to break our alliance with the Soviet Union, to overthrow the regime and to restore capitalism by impeding socialist construction But although the conspirators and their leader succeeded in occupying important posts in both party and state, they did not manage, unlike Tito in Yugoslavia, to usurp power and attain their criminal ends Thanks to our people's loyalty to the Soviet Union, the conspiracy was broken On the basis of these facts, the accused: Former secretary of the party, of Jewish origin Former head of Department of International Relations, of Jewish origin Former head of Economic Department, of Jewish origin Former assistant secretary, Czech Former minister of Foreign Affairs, Slovak Former undersecretary of National Defense, of Jewish origin Former undersecretary of Security, Czech Of Jewish origin - Of Jewish origin, both former undersecretaries of Foreign Affairs Of Jewish origin - Of Jewish origin, both former undersecretaries of Foreign Trade Of Jewish origin, former secretary of Finance Of Jewish origin, former secretary of the Regional Committee Of Jewish origin, former editor of the party newspaper All these I accuse of having - For three hours, absolute silence reigned as the indictment was read We were being filmed, soon to be displayed in cinemas The court will adjourn Sit down Cigarette? Coffee? Are you okay? - Vitamins - Sit down Is it going well? Drink that it's a political expedient Open your mouth, these are vitamins Do you need anything? The president hopes you will acquit yourselves well Did you give him some coffee? All right? I've been making inquiries There will be no death sentences What the party needs is not heads but a top-level political trial Any death sentences will be purely for the sake of form If anyone retracts in court, the microphone will be cut off and the 20 prosecution witnesses will testify It's mine The court is in session We are resuming live transmission of the conspiracy trial You are about to hear the testimony of the former undersecretary of Security The American spy, Noel Field, unmasked during the Rajk trial, testified that he had formed an espionage network in our country How did you conceal what you knew of this? When we realized we could not suppress his evidence, I ordered a formal inquiry to be made I warned those involved to prepare their defense There's a slight change in the text to be learned You're next Let's hear the beginning of your statement - I know it perfectly - Question: What led you to become an active enemy of the state? I was raised in a bourgeois milieu, estranged from - Do you want an interpreter? Do you understand the questions and can you reply? What school were you at? The German school in Ostrava - What is your first language? - German Do you know German really well? I haven't spoken it for a long time So you know no language well You are a typical cosmopolitan What was your attitude to the workers? I was indifferent Did you understand the question? What was your attitude to the workers? I was indifferent to the interests of the workers I was indifferent to the interests of the workers I never felt affinity with them Their national interests were alien to me Your turn soon Remember, everything depends on your attitude I was raised in a bourgeois milieu, estranged from the workers Guided by my bourgeois instinct- bourgeois and selfish, to further my career, I was changed by 11 years in the West I became a cosmopolitan and defected to the bourgeois camp I confess I have been guilty of actively participating, from 1948 to the day of my arrest, in the conspiracy against the state I acknowledge my guilt in having furthered - That man on the radio isn't my father, is he? I told them at school he wasn't You go to bed too espionage relations with the British agent, Zilliacus, by using the diplomatic pouch at the Foreign Office I myself also maintained espionage relations with the American agent, Noel Field, supplying him with espionage information My wife decided to write of her despair and confusion to the president, whom she knew We shall read you the letter sent to the president by Londonova, wife of one of the traitors on trial "President Gottwald After my husband's arrest, knowing what I did of his life and his activities, I thought him the victim of traitors using him to shield their own criminal activities Unfortunately, after hearing the indictment and his confession, my hopes crumbled My husband was no victim, but a traitor to our party and a traitor to his country My grief is great, naturally But as a communist, I must be thankful for this unmasking and join all sincere comrades in demanding just punishment for these traitors" As ex-factory director, I can leave early Because of me You should never have hired me No, I'm not of working-class origin and I was in the West during the war I don't blame you at all I know you are sincere But you were wrong to write that letter I wrote it to the president and not for public broadcasting But you heard him plead guilty I heard a great deal too much, and all of it rings false They're reciting lessons I don't believe in this trial Why would the party hold it if it weren't true? - There have been precedents - Precisely The whole thing smacks of anti-semitism It's intolerable Yesterday's heroes becoming spies and traitors - I can't accept it I'm handing in my party card You realize what that means? But why should he confess, a man like him? Well, he - I hope he'll tell us one day When I heard the indictment, I analyzed once more Reicin's activities during the occupation and concluded that he must have betrayed to the Gestapo Julius Fucik and the clandestine Central Committee Forget the Central Committee That's all in Reicin's statement, already signed I would like to recall Fucik's last words "Whoever has lived for the future and fallen for its beauty is a figure hewn in stone But he who, with the dust of the past, tries to build a dam against revolution, is but a puppet, even though wearing epaulettes of gold Men, whom I loved so, be vigilant" The testimony of Fucikova, widow of the Resistance hero, made an indelible impression on the judges The leader of the conspiracy said, "Our conspiracy against the state comprised hundreds of members" A big task lies ahead for the judges - Coming? - Yes I'll continue These three benches tremble under the weight of crimes committed This leader should be seen by all His red hair, his Judas eyebrows, his furtive eyes crushed under the huge weight of his crimes A dead man A dog should die a dog's death The court is in session In 1939, I established espionage contacts in London With whom? With the American agent Emanuel Voska to whom I gave information concerning communist cells in England Carry on I also had dealings with the intelligence agent Hamson, who summoned me in December, 1944, to a meeting at the Ministry of Information at the British Ministry of Information, concerning my subversive activities in our country- in our country after it was liberated Return to your place Court adjourned In ridiculing justice, you confirm your activity as an imperialist lackey It will cost you your life Traitor Don't leave him He gambled his life away He did it on purpose He'll pay for making a mockery of the trial The court is in session Rise to receive sentence From November 20 to 27, 1952, the State Tribunal has heard the proceedings concerning the leaders of the conspiracy against the state In the name of the Republic, sentence of death - In the name of the Republic, sentence of life imprisonment- life imprisonment- life imprisonment The accused are granted time to consult their lawyers as to whether to accept these sentences Likewise, the court reserves its rights Court adjourned Where's my interrogator? Where are our interrogators? Where's my interrogator? I want to see my interrogator Go get him Where have our interrogators gone? Where are the interrogators? I'll appeal I want to appeal too Me too - So do I - We must Here are your lawyers There are truckloads of resolutions demanding death for all of you The international situation is deteriorating. World war is looming. With Eisenhower elected, the party needs you if you appeal, then so will the court And that means hanging Comrade countries are demanding your death If you accept the court's decision, you will be pardoned The party needs a trial, not your heads The court is in session Accused, do you accept your sentences? I accept and renounce my right to appeal I accept and renounce my right to appeal I accept and renounce my right to appeal Criminally, we had all been rehabilitated by 1963 Politically, some of us remain unrehabilitated Why did no one retract at the trial in front of the journalists? Because only triumphant adversaries of communism would have believed us You were freed and rehabilitated in 1963? No, I was freed in 1956, but it's more complicated A year after Stalin's death, the minister of Security, Beria, and certain advisers were executed in Russia in 1955, a commission began to investigate the trials Kohoutek's gang were imprisoned We survivors remained in prison Two years later, Kohoutek was pardoned, whereas many of his victims lingered on in prison for two or three years Don't you remember me? What happened to us? Do you understand it at all? You know, when you were freed in 1956, I was in prison! Those who gave the orders then are still in power I followed orders I expect I was under surveillance too May I offer you a drink? How's your wife? All right? I know she did a lot for you, here and in France, after realizing you were innocent How's your health? You must take care of yourself I've found a nice, quiet job They won't catch me again I'm happy for you April 1968 Do you want to keep this Kohoutek story? "What happened to us? Do you understand it at all?" August 20, 1968 I read it all night Is he really going to publish? Not me, the Union of Czechoslovak Writers They're awaiting the manuscript The situation is still troubled, you know The imperialist forces are mounting You may bring grist- - To the enemy's mill I know! You'll at least take me to the airport? I'm not alone now The party wants the truth told, despite certain difficulties - I hope we won't regret it - Good-bye, my dear Of course, they'll say, "I wouldn't have confessed" They'll wonder why I'm still alive But at least I'm not alone now The party and I speak together In January, 1968, the reactionary forces were removed from the party A new era began in Czechoslovakia The people found their voices again after years of silence, passivity, indifference or scorn This was the proof that socialism lies in the liberty of the masses But the day I arrived in Prague, I had to witness my country invaded by 600, 000 men and 6, 000 tanks of the Warsaw Pact powers USSR - YOURS CSR - OURS WAKE UP, LENIN! BREZHNEV'S GONE MAD! ARISE, LENIN! THEY'VE GONE MAD!
