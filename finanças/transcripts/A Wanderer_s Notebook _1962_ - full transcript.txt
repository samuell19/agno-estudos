Mama! What is it? Papa. Papa's been arrested. Police? They said he was cheating the customers. Sing your song! Come on, sing! Louder! One hottie makes your skin shine rosy. Two bottles make it shine like snow. Try for yourself! So this coloured water does the magic? You fool! Stupid! HER LOVELY LANE Executive Producers: Masumi Fujimoto Mikio Naruse, Tadahiro Teramoto Screenplay: Toshiro Ide, Sumie Tanaka From the novel by Fumiko Hayashi and the play by Kazuo Kikuta Photographie: Jun Yasumoto Production design: SATOSHI Chuko Music: Yuji Koseki Starring Hideko Takamine Akira Takarada, Daisuke Kato Keiju Kobayashi Kinuyo Tanaka, Mitsuko Kusabue Noboru Nakaya, Yunosuke Ito Directed by Mikio Naruse My mother and I are carrying bags. How hot it is! Carrying a pack a girl totters through the city in the sun. Good day sir. Would you like to buy some. Very low price. Very nice, very low. I'm not buying. It's very hot in Tokyo. My shadow on the white road is crawling like a black toad. Welcome! Isn't it hot? How's business? Bad. It couldn't be worse. Times are bad. My work doesn't pay me much... but I have nothing else. I'm sorry, but will you give us time for the rent? All right. By the way, there's a letter from your husband. Oh? No money with it, I'm sure. He should send us some. Wouldn't she like being a bus conductress? Conductress? They pay 45 yen a month. Afraid she can't do the work. She's such a strange girl. Why make so much smoke? Coal is bad. What did he father say? So much rain, he's not sold anything in Kyushu. Let me see. I think I have to go to help him. He wrote he scarcely eats... Bad luck, you and I are here living some place he can't live. Welcome home! Gotten hot, hasn't it? Yes and it's only the beginning of summer. Why act that way? Mr. Yasuoka spoke to you. I don't like him. Nor my father. Nor any man at all... Why don't you like your father? He's take care of you since you were eight. You should thank him for that. I don't think I should. You went to school, though. Did you forget it already? I worked through school, didn't I? I worked in factories, as a maid, and peddling. I earned my own living. I even sent him money after I graduated from school. Did you forget that too? You shouldn't say that. I don't care. We're no father and daughter. You go to him, leave me alone! I'll go on living if I have to become a whore. Excuse me, would you like these? I bought some for you. Thank you, it's very kind of you. - Going for a bath? - Yes. See you later. Good day, and thank you. He's very nice. Why don't you like him? Wonder how much he makes? He was widowed five years ago. Maybe he'll marry again. None of your business. Nor mine. You still love Katori, don't you? That student who brought you to Tokyo... And when he finished school... deserted you and went home. Yes, I loved him. And I can't forget him... Just like you love my father... and won't be separated from him. I wish I could see you once more. I wish I had money now! I wish I had even ten yen. I wish I could buy a bowl of noodles. It's no use writing a letter to him... to a man who married a woman who is better than me. So this writing is only to console me. How much do we have. What are you doing? 1, 2, 3, 4... 5 yen. Fumiko! 12 yen and 60 sen in all. You worry about Father. You take the money to go to Father. Don't worry... I'm not a child any more. I can take care of myself all right. Only thirty yen a month will do. Why can't I find a job? Had I five sen now, I could buy a sack of rice. Then, I'd have a nice boiled rice and pickled radish. My wish is that simple. Isn't there some way to make it come true? The line shortens little by little... Some come out smiling and some disappointed. We are getting tired standing before the door. Only two are wanted, but more than fifty girls have gathered here. Now, it's my turn at last. He reads my personal history. Examines my character... and appraises my appearance. After I am exposed to view for a while he says he'll advise me later. I've got accustomed to this way of refusal... But still it's stupid. I've powered my face very thick today. A picture of a country girl in town. I'm waiting for some theatre manager. How does he look, I wonder. A tall man with glasses passes by me. He's good-looking and well dressed. "You're the applicant?" "Yes, I am." He resumes walking. So I follow him like a dog. We enter a small bar. He says his troop is a touring company and they lack actress so I could join any time. His handkerchief is peeping out of his breast pocket. His face looks thin, easy to forget. By intuition, I feel something improper. I endure anything, but being tricked by a man like him. He unfolds my personal history with cigarette stained fingers then pockets it. Maybe what he needs is myself not my paper. He treats me to a glass of cider and guides me to a hotel in which he has his office. His office is a front. A room without furniture looks strange. He tell me lies, so I tell him lies. No wonder the world is full of lies. In due times he says he wants to play with me. I say it's absurd to say such things. When I walk out of the room, a girl says she's brought noodles. I smile my refusal and step out to the street. But those red boxes of noodles linger before my eyes. Will he eat all of the noodles? I want to eat noodles. I've found a job at a stock broker's office named Iwai. We'll give you 35 yen and in a month. Work hours are from 9 to 4. By the way, can you keep accounts? What? Book-keeping? I think I can. OK, we'll try you. 35 yen a month with lunch! What a wonderful world I see now! Mother! You'd be surprises for your daughter's success if I sent you ten yen. The man leads me to a large desk. As I sit before the desk like a block of rock, I become worried about what I've said: "I can keep accounts." I open the large book the man has brought. It's book-keeping by double entry... and utterly different from what I know. The sweat streams down on my face. Long arrays of big figures that I haven't ever seen before. If I calculated and entered these numbers all day... I would be insane by night fall... But I use the abacus as if I was clever with it. Though I was no good at all in using it. And the memory chills my heart. A telegram for you. Thank you. Have you found a job? Employment cancelled. Iwai Bad news? Sorry I'll be late with the rent. Wouldn't you like to be a bus conductress? 45 yen a month? I applied for it once. Rejected? Because I'm near-sighted. The world in which they calculate those big figures everyday... I'm sure I wouldn't like it at all. But as long as the big figures scare me... I'll never be a millionaire. Excuse me Come in. You did this, didn't you? Miss Hayashi... I wish you'd accept it. Why? I can't bear to see you suffer. Please take it. I can't accept money without reason. Thanks just the same. Maybe I shouldn't. I was afraid it might offend you. Oh, no. I'm not offended at all. You mean it? I feel relieved now. I asked if there was a job for you at my factory But no employment now. I've found a job. Really? That's fine! I went everyday to a job painting celluloid toys. It pays 75 sen a day. Today, 2 months have been passed. I'm getting tired of painting toys like this... All day long... You're too beautiful for this kind of job. I wish I have Fumiko's patience. Thought she'd give up in two days. This looked very hard at first, but it doesn't now. Come on, hurry up! You are always chattering. Mind you. This is urgent. What are you doing Kumiko? Slowing down? We are not machines. Make us hurry, pay us orderly. Sounds as if you were working for nothing, eh? We work a half-an hour extra-time every day... But you never pay for it. I'm disgusted with that work. I think I'll become a bar hostess. Bar hostess? Why don't you come with me? But, I have no other kimonos than this. They lend you nice clothes. You wear a white apron too. Drinking and singing. Far better life than now. You can never pass a book store without stopping. I'll be going. I'm in a hurry. Good bye then. Think it over, will you, about the job? Yes, good bye. Miss Hayashi! From your mother. Thank you. "I've been sick since I came over here. So I can't go out selling." "Father's business is not good at all." "And soon it will be winter, I'm at a loss thinking of our future." "I know you are making a bare living..." "but will you send me some money even a little?" Miss Hayashi... You had your supper? I got my pay today. So I bought two cutlets. Here you are. Thank you. How is your mother? Is she fine? Mr. Yasuoka, could you lend me some money? My mother is sick... That's terrible! I'm glad it's my pay day. How much? Ten yen please. Tell me what you need. I have no family, so I can spare more. Is it enough? Yes. Thank you. I'm sorry. It's selfish of me to ask you for it. No. I'm glad you did. I regret I bought this. You shouldn't. You love books. Ah. Poetry! I once bought the poems of Takuboku. His poems are wonderful. This printing business has changed my hands. Look! Mine too. The paint's stained my finger nails. Miss Hayashi. Fumiko. I think I could make our living on my pay of 60 yen. Will you please me. Maybe it's not right to ask like this... Immediately after I made you a loan. I know I am nobody... nor good enough to be your friend. But I've seen you all these months, and I want to make you happy. Angry? No. But I used to be married. I used to live with a man. I am a widower, too. I'm grateful to you for your kindness. But I don't think I could lead a happy married life with you. I am very sorry, Mr. Yasuoka. Oh, don't... Don't be. Miss Hayashi! I'm happy to serve you. Excuse me. And what part do you play? You come to see me? Yes, I will with a bouquet! Gaef! What is it? Gaef. It's a name Is it French? It's Russian. When the cherry orchard has been sold. He laments and says: "The orchard is all white." "You haven't forgotten it Lyuba?" "That long avenue runs straight, straight as an arrow." "It shines during moonlit nights." That's nice! Come her Fumiko. You like plays, don't you? A new girl? Yes, call her Fumiko. How do you do? You have charming eyes! I'm near-sighted. Be more romantic! This is Mr. Date. He writes poems and plays. He plays on the stage too. What were you writing? Love letters? No. She writes poems and stories. Who is your favourite? Heine. Whitman. And Pushkin. How is she? Let me see your poem will you? "That night upon the table in a bar," "Cried the decoring face." "What matters if a crow crows in a tree." "The night is sad." "My face in the palms of my hands," "Tired in green powders," "Pulled the hands of twelve o'clock." Any more? Yes, at home. These are amazing. She's good, isn't she? I'd like to read more of your poems. I never imagined I'd read a poem in a place like this. What? A place like this? "My face in the palm of my hands," "Tired in green powders," "Pulled the hands of twelve o'clock." That's good. So good? Buy me a drink. Yes, I will. I'll treat everyone. To the poems found in a bar. "I'm a red ball out in the fields." "When the wind blows hard, I fly." "Like an eagle high up in the sky." "Come on wind, with your breath." "Come on wind, strike me, the red ball." May I come in? Yes? Come on. Where? It's sunny outside. It'd be nice to take a walk. Ah, it's Sunday. Would you like to take a walk with me? Mr. Yasuoka. I'm sorry I didn't return you the money yet. That's all right. I'd be happy if you forgot it. I don't understand you. I really mean it. As long as its unreturned... I feel as if we were tied with each other. There are lots of girls much better than me. Why do you like a girl like me? There are not. Yes, there are. There may be, but not to me. A guest, Miss Hayashi! Will you excuse me? Mr. Date! It's been a long time. I was touring around the country. Come in. Be careful on the stairs. Come in. - Work today? - Yes, I'll go in the evening. My... You have good books! I'm surprised. I had more. But I had to sell them. Well, that's life... but, that's what makes you write. It's sunny. Would you like to take a walk? Our poet group is going to publish a book. Won't you join us? Really? I've come to tell you that. I'm so happy. I'm envious... There's something about you that... let's you be happy. Aren't you happy? Do you think a man who is happy and contented would leave his home for over two months? Well then, you and your wife... You have one? Yes, but she is no good. She makes me feel as if I were imprisoned. What's so funny? Forgive me. They say when a man speaks to a new girl he usually speaks ill of his old girl. You've been hurt. Is it impossible for us to have our own happiness in this world? You enjoy teasing me. Teasing? I'm the one who's teased. I know how I feel toward them. So I'm afraid of myself... afraid and disgusted! That's why... Fumiko! I am in love with the Buddha. When I kiss him on his cold lips. My heart trembles with awe and joy... And the stream of my blood runs backward. I'm back! Welcome home. I'm back! Any job? Bar hostess or waitress at a sukiyaki restaurant. Want some cake? Imagawayaki? Cake for the common people. This will be my supper. It's pity that you're here with me and I don't earn our living by myself. Don't worry. I'll earn what I eat somehow. I don't mind working at the restaurant. One sukiyaki! My wish is... that you sit in a quiet room... and write poems and stories. But you couldn't afford your wife's living either. Don't want it? I'll eat them all then. Give me one. Good isn't it? Yes it is. Your wife... is she beautiful? Yes, she is. Why don't you go back to her, then? You're cruel. Why don't you understand that I need you now? Only now, is it? You little fool! I am lonely. Could anyone ever be bad to such a sweet girl? Oh. I wish I were rich! If I were rich, I'd never let you worry about money. I'll be broke soon. Writings poems doesn't make money. Must work on the stage. But you don't like it. Certainly not. I can't stand making a show of myself. I'll work from tomorrow on. I think I can earn our living. One sukiyaki! Good isn't it? Where are you from? The mountains of Tanba. Where is Tanba? I don't know. Get you there. Have another, Tanba monkey. Monkey? All right. Monkeys like to drink. Don't make her drink too much. She's new here. Come here, Fumiko! She takes care of them. You have other things to do. Really! Getting drunk at your first night! Madam wants you now. Already back? I walked out of the bar. Actually I was fired. Is he in? He's been out all afternoon. Did you find a job? Don't worry. You'll get your rent. Would you lend me needle and thread? Didn't you buy them yet? I forgot. The seams have gone. Well, I'll fix it for you. Thank you. It's very kind of you. Oh. Fumiko! A woman bring it for him. Kyoko Hinetsu? Is it all right? A friend of his. An actress. She works with him. Be careful, though. Your man is handsome. Don't worry. "Dear Haruhiko." "In the night we rehearsed The Cherry Orchard..." "I became your wife. Though not formally," "and we have been actually man and wife ever since." "You said you'd marry me when you got money." "But now, you've taken another woman into your room." "I hear she's a maid..." It smells like a woman's room. Does she stay here? Of course not. I share this room with solitude. She sleeps in a room downstairs. Honestly? Honestly. She came here with my drunken friends. We've slept here that night. And on the morning I woke to find her dusting and washing... As if she were my maid. I don't think she lives here only as a maid. Why are you so sceptical? You know why. I can't stay away from you any longer. We'll be together when we're married. Then when will that be? When I have money as I told you. I could ask my parents for the money for our wedding. Could you? Naturally. I'm their daughter after all. Darling! Hello! Why are you back so early? This lady... Who is she? Miss Kyoko Hinatsu. An actress. She writes poems too. You know her name, right? You don't have to tell her that. Just tell her I'm your wife. I am also his wife. What did you say? I am his wife. Miss Hayashi. My wife is this lady. Is she the one who was in hospital? Or another woman? Does this matter? Miss Hayashi. Does a husband call his wife "Miss"? Now, we don't need you here. You can go. Don't, Kyoko. Let's have a drink together here. With your maid? Not with you. Not now. Not here! Wait! We'll talk later. Back to the life of a hostess again... I felt like I was going crazy. And my heart wanted men crazily... Once more! Let her rest. She is sweating. Gosh. It's hot. Give me a drink. You are born in Kyushu? How do you know? Your way of talking. You're right. I travelled a lot when I was a child. Nagasaki, Sasebo... and other towns in Kyushu... I changed school seven times. This is all I have now. But I need a little more. No, Mother. I didn't expect you tonight. But Papa caught a bad cold. He's getting worse. Money? Yes, but don't. Better than nothing. Take it. Thank you. Mother... Thank you very much. Tokiko is working hard enough. Don't push her too much. I know. Your mother's come again? Work harder and earn more... Or you'll have to do worse. Fumiko, you dance well. So here's a tip for you Thanks. Our girls don't know how to entertain men. Let it be a lesson. Fumiko! Someone wants to see you. A bear. This is Fumiko. Miss Fumiko Hayashi? You wrote the poem 'A Work Woman's Song', eh? We liked it very much. Pardon me. I'm Shirazaka of the Pacific Poet. Oh, the author of 'The Square Moon'? Yes. Did you read it? I'm Uenoyama. I know your poetry too, 'The Proletariat Sings'. 'A Work Woman's Song' was very good. Smelled the sweat of the poor. It's because I'm one of them myself. Why don't you join our group? He belongs to the Red Flag Union. You'd get mixed up in a riot and picked up someday. That would never happen to me. I'm poor but I don't like the red flag. You mean it's hopeless? There's a lot of poor people who have no time for such things. This gentleman seems very quiet. Pardon me. He's Fukuchi, winner of the Pacific Poets award. You can't tell. I might refuse it. There are all strange, aren't they? Really strange. Then will you write for us? Will I write for your magazine? We're counting on you. Nobody can write poems like yours. No woman among us. Yes, I will! I will! But no pay for it. That doesn't matter. I want money but all of you write for nothing, don't you? That's right. In token of my thanks, I'll buy a bottle! Thank you! Looks like we are being bribed. What's the matter? Your face... You look beautiful now. Oh, my face? When you're writing at the desk... you're beautiful indeed. Really? If I was beautiful to our customers they'd tip me more. I wish I could write like you. I envy you. Someday, you'll be a great poetess. I have a reason to write poems. "My life is not all like this." "My life won't end this way." I tell myself this. I don't think I'll become great. I can't write difficult things because I have little learning. But you can write poems without it. You could do better if you had, but it's not indispensable. I, too, think I must not live like this. I have to do something. But nothing turns out... My father is sick and my mother is weak. I've borrowed money from you again. Don't let it worry you. Your mother reminds me of my mother who is in the country. We quarrelled often when we were together... But I miss her very much now that we are far apart. I'd like to see her dressed in gorgeous kimono, sitting on a silk cushion and eating her favourite food. Just once in my whole life. Who is? Fumiko again? Turn the light off! Oh, shut up! Hello, Miss Hayashi. Oh, Mr. Yasuoka. It's been a long time. I called at your former lodging house a few days ago. They gave me your address. Not very nice place, isn't it? You're living in here? Yes. You can't study here, can you? No. Just earning enough. It is all I can do now. He was a bad one, that Mr. Date! Geisha girls? Yes. I'm sorry I can't return the money yet but I will. Don't let it worry you. I told you so, didn't I? But... I really mean it. I must be going now. You're very kind. Please call me any time if I can be of any help to you. Remember that. Thank you. Good day. Good afternoon. The girls walking down the street look like a sole in a stream. I wish I could be like them. Oh God! Wherever you are. Answer me! Are you really standing around me? I don't think you like a girl like me. I can't see through you, you God! Yet, I can't help by pray you. That I may today sell this story. We don't usually buy children's stories by unknown writer. But this is my best work. Don't you like it? Leave it here anyway. We might buy it, but we wouldn't pay you much. Maybe less than thirty sen per page. Twenty sen per page will be enough. Ten page. 1 yen and 50 sen in all. That'll be all then. Well, keep looking hard. Read Andersen. Yes, I'll read Andersen. Eight! Nine! - You're all right? - I am all right! Ten! Great! She drunk all ten glasses. I can't believe it! Did she drink 10 glasses? Now your bet! Ten yen against her drinking ten cups. A bet is a bet. That's wonderful. Let's celebrate Fumiko! I should get some too, shouldn't I? Oh. good evening. Is she in? Tokiko? Tokiko! Bring some drinks, quick! Come on, entertain them well. - Are you already going? - Yes. See you soon. Thank you very much. Tokiko. You are more beautiful than ever. Pretty like a jewel. Not like this dunghill. Is it me who is the dunghill? Exactly. You sluts are no better than dunghills. That is not proper language. Well, Tokiko. Can I keep you company tonight? What do you mean, keep me company? To sleep with. And you know that. Keep quiet! She's so naive. That's why I'm fond of her. Then don't teach her such words. She'll become a slut like you... unless somebody protects her. And I will do it. There are girls at the Golden Star that are for sale for 50 sen. What a talk! None of our girls are like that. Sure. Not worth that much by far. 35 sen at best. A 35 sen whore. That's a laugh! You fools! To hell with you! What's this? Fumiko! How dare you! I called fools fools, that's all! You drank too much. Go! Take her away girls! Hurry! Come, Fumiko! Everybody knows whether or not he's good-looking. Look at your face in a mirror. What? No hard feelings now. Tokiko be nice to you. You too Mr. Nishihara. A man... a man has to die if he does not eat. When we're starving... who could blame us if we sold ourselves for ten sen! Shut up, Fumiko! Come on! Take her away. You talk big, but don't know nothing. Get out, you swine! And what are you? Get out and what? Fumiko! You're fired! You can't talk me like that! Fool! Stop it! She's drunk, that's all. How disgusting. Let's go! Then, why don't you drink next door. Tokiko, you go with them and make them happy. Please enjoy company. Please cheer up and have nice time and good drinks. What a jerk! Good riddance. You're right. Is Fumiko in? Mr. Shirasaka! Oh, there you are. One beer, please. This is Miss Fumiko Hayashi, Miss Hinatsu. She's a member of our group. She writes poems too. Oh, pardon me! Fumiko, you were Date's girl once. What do you know? Who was the first? I was before her... and I was after her. Is that so? Then Fumiko was between you. I tell you what... we're through, he and I. Really? He was impossible. Thinking too much of himself. Yes indeed. He believed handsome men are almighty. I'll make a proposition. Why don't you two publish a magazine. Just two of us? Yes. And you can beat men down with your poems. I can't beat men down anyhow. I can't stop loving them though they beat me. How honest you are! But we need money. I'll pay you up. My parents send me money every month. We could afford to drink with that money. But that's nothing. I'll vote for the magazine. Your poems must be read by people. If not, they are useless. It's your secret, isn't it? A magazine for two of us, but I'm only an addition, aren't I? Why? Because you are in love with Kyoko. You shouldn't mention it. Don't hide it from us. Let's publish that magazine together. What do you like the title to be? 'Couple'? Two women who used to be the wives of one man. Interesting, isn't it? Shall we start it, then? Let's do it! It's settled. I'll arrang to have it published soon. You must be very happy. He's still at it. I'll marry you when I want to. Wish that 'd be soon. - This sounds sad. - Don't make me feel too sad. Come to my place Fumiko, when you feel lonely. You give me the meaning of life. I give you the pleasure of life. How harsh! You want to be the food and drink of your woman? I meant, love that much. That's the same thing. But it's clear cut. I like it. Well, I don't know Let's have a toast! Come join us everybody! Let's drink! I've written a children's song. But I don't know if it can sell. I've stopped expecting. Yet, I write and write like a fury. And still, silly things well up in my mind... Sweet and dear memories of this and that. God bless my soul! Amen! - Hello! - Is Fumiko in? Is that you, Mr. Fukuchi? Come in, please. I'm glad you've come. I have no place else to go in this rain. It's a pity I have nothing to treat you to. I had 5 sen this morning... so I bought some candy. My ration for today. Aren't you working? Not for several days. Look at my legs. All swollen up. When you push, it makes a pit. See? Eat lots of barley. That's my problem, to eat lots. Lots. What would you like to eat now? - Boiled eggs. - What else? Taiyaki cakes. What else? Strawberry jam. What else? Chinese noodles. What else? You're mean. My stomach's growling. Let's go eat them all. I've money today. I sold an essay. That's great! Why didn't you tell me that first? That's nothing. It's only occasional they pay us for writing. Don't take things that way. Someday you'll be able to earn your living. You're too optimistic. Not exactly. Sometimes I wish I would die. Late in the night, I take a walk. I don't think, honestly, I wish to die... But I say "I wish I would die". Then, I feel somehow at ease. To feel at ease is a pleasure you can get without a penny. The whiteness of the stone makes them look light. Someday I'll become a tombstone like that... someday. Will I be able to become a ghost? A ghost need neither to eat nor to pay rent. The affection for parents, the torment from the sense of repayment... They vanish like smoke. Encircled among a family of new stones which belong to nobody yet. The mason is sleeping peacefully. When the day breaks he cuts and dresses the stones, and makes money from them. It goes the same way in any business. I think I will marry Mr. Fukuchi. Hello! Hello! Hatsuko, come in. Good day! How are you? As you see... Not very well. Come in anyway. All the girls are well? About half of them left after you'd gone. Really? How is Tokiko? That's why I came. I'm entrusted with the money... She told me she'd borrowed. 6 Yen and 50 sen. What's become of her... married? If it were marriage... but. Mistress of that construction workers' boss. She gets 80 yen allowance monthly. I met her once She wore a nice kimono. Let's have some noodles. Don't worry. Someone's waiting for me today. Going to that pawnshop. So far? An old friend of mine. Gives me more than the others. So long! Good-bye! I sold my futon. Fukuchi says that one is enough for us two. I paid the rent overdue. I bought rice and curtain with what was left and came to him. We've eaten nothing since morning. Sitting down in the room. We both write without expectations. How about eating something nice? Curry rice, pork cutlet or beefsteak? Any money? Well, without food we can't live. No collector will come till tomorrow morning. So... Can you manage tomorrow? Tomorrow is tomorrow. Miss Hayashi! Postman. Look! Postal order. Three Yen! For the stories I wrote 6 months ago. 30 sen a sheet. wonderful! Thanks, thanks! I'm grateful to Buddha! No use to worry about tomorrow. A lucky wind already blows for us. Let's celebrate whatever we like. Curry rice, pork cutlet or beefsteak? Shut up! We're hungry. Let's go out for dinner. Got 30 sen for a sheet. Don't get so excited. As if you're already rich. Send my manuscrits off now. You mean at once? That's right. Can't you wait tomorrow... What? From Mr. Fukuchi? I've read his story, and I'm sorry to say it's unsuitable for our magazine. I should like to ask of you just one more chance. No use to keep it. Excuse me, I am busy. Give me a cigarette! Just a moment, please. Dinner's ready. Cigarettes! I'll go to buy cigarettes. Please eat this. Don't you like these? Cigarettes! Paid 5 sen for beancurd. 3 sen for sardines. And 2 sen for pickles. Look! I made 3 kinds of dishes. Don't you appreciate my cooking? Don't boast about it. Where you going? Here's cigarette money. Good bye! What shall I do? I don't know. Keep on living with him... I'll be tough as steel. I'll be a woman with neither smiles nor tears. I want to make a fire... gather and burn empty bales and leaves. I've no wish to live on under these conditions. No energy at all. I want to burn his papers. Come back to the room to take out the important papers. Take out three of his poems and hold them over the fire. Poems will be nothing but ashes. I hate him, yet I hesitate to burn them. After all I can't burn them and take them back. I carried my husband's transcripts to publisher every day. But nothing change. To Miss Hayashi, c/o Mr. Fukuchi. Hope I'm not wasting your time. No, You've come at a good time. Miss Himatsu and Miss Murano are here. I introduce you to Miss Murano. Mr. Shirasaka... I've come to ask to make us a loan. Oh, I see . All right, I understand. Come on in, anyway. It's Fumiko! It's been a long time! Hello, Kyoko. This is Miss Fumiko Hayashi of the Pacific Poets. Mrs Fukuchi..? That's right. This is Miss Murano, a rising writer. Ho do you do? Please to meet you. Miss Murano lives not far from your love nest. About five minutes walk. We haven't yet attacked your love nest... Could we come one day? Yes, please. You have a fine reputation among us. You're carrying his manuscripts to publishers? You couldn't do it if you married Mr. Shirasaka? Don't worry about me. I would carry her manuscripts. There'd be no better husband in the world. Why don't you get married? No. Not yet. A waiting game? I'm back. Must be hungry. I bought taiyaki cakes. Have some. Can't trick me like this! What's the matter? Why are you angry? Your manuscripts... They didn't sell. I went to all the publishers. But it was the same thing. And finally I was getting tired of it. I ran from one publisher to another only for you. What does this mean? A letter came with it. "We regret to inform you that your novelette brought this morning" "is unsuitable for our magazine, hence returned herewith." Returned so soon! Sooner than your return! Don't tell me you were carrying my stories. I did carry yours, too... But something had to be sold, my own at least. I've had enough of married life with you. Don't say that, please! I want to settle with you here, after all. Excuse me. Is Fumiko in? Mother! It's been so long. Come in Mother! My mother has come from the country. I am Fumiko's mother. Please take good care of her. Don't you want to wash up? Yes, I will. Thank you. This is the left-over from lunch. It hasn't gone bad. You can eat it. Where you going? He seems like he's afraid. Are you happy with him? He's nice to me sometimes... But if I'd come to marry someone again... I'd marry a carpenter or even a rickshawman. But never a writer! All is the same in the country... dull as usual. Times are at their worst now. Do you have some money? No more than 30 sen now. What are you going to do? If I could stay here... for several days, father will bring his goods here. What are they? He bought some baskets intending to sell them here. They'll never sell at all. Business is poor in Tokyo, too? You'd better go back home... before father comes up. But I arrived here only today! What else can we do? We have no extra bedding here. Your husband is late. He won't be back tonight. It happen often? I got used to it. Won't you come back to the country with me? After these two years and a half, your face look so hard. It's my myopia. It got worse. Come back to the country and start a new life! Shall we you and I live together go peddling again? You're unfortunate in your marriage. I hear TB can be cured by drinking a soup made of horse shit. But what's good for the poor man? Double suicide? Money, money, always money. They say money is circulating among people but although I work, it doesn't get to me. Here it is! Are you at home, Fukuchi? Fumiko, are you there? Nobody in? - Shall we come in? - Without invitation? Nothing to steal, eh? Good day. They're out. Better house than I expected. Guess the rent is 8 yen. I don't like poems with trade mark of poverty. Because you're well bred and rich, eh? Her poems, like open dust-bins stir contents and throw them out just to see them. Something of physical disgust? Some people like her poems. Call them naked. That nakedness... She wants to show off her nudity. As if to say I'm so poor, don't you think... It's like standing on a stage. That's bitter criticism but... there's nothing of a love-nest around here. Do they get on well together? Fukuchi is selfish... Perhaps TB naturally made him so. She chooses and loves handsome boys only.. You can't blame her on that score. If so, you should be desperate. You're welcome, nice to see you. Hello! We were waiting for you. No locks. May tempt a burglar. Fukuchi is not here? Went to the hospital? How's he lately? There's nothing definite. How are things? Well, Yasuko wants to talk to you. So I brought her here Mrs Hasegawa wants to read your stories and Kyoko's. Poems? She prefers prose... Maybe it will appear in her magazine. You're ambitious, so may want to write for a large magazine like... But it's good though for a debut. Of course, if they take me, I'll be so pleased. I'll write too. Please send them to me, both of you. Deadline is May 31. Only one is chose. So... don't blame us if you fail. How are you? Welcome home! Fumiko, are you going to write for the magazine? Yes, I am. You may consider this a chance but don't disgrace yourself. That sounds strange Fukuchi. A writer like you can not understand. You don't understand neither. Fumiko loves you. A tough girl like Fumiko is good for you, a sick man. Be reasonable. Imbecile! What? I'm advising you out of kindness. Do you want me to give material to one... who works to feed her husband and is proud of it? Let's go! Good-bye! We'll come again. Good-bye! Listen. Shirasaki said that your poems are dirty like... like stirring a dust-bin and spilling it. I live that way. I can't write a false story. Dust-bin. He said it! I agree with him. I'm tired of you. Get out and leave me. No. I won't. Why not? I don't like you, either. A man like a rotten woman. But any man will do for my husband. I've come to know that how often I divorce and remarry... A man's still a man. I've another reason... I've found a better girl so go away. I asked you to come with me, if you feel lonely, you remember? I'm still lonely. I have a girl. Better bring her here. Alright, I will. Please. I'll sleep with her. I don't care. Whatever you do. I'll stay. I'm your wife. Stay if you like. Do you like me so much? No, I hate you! Applaud me with clapping hands just for escaping from a man. Oh god. What should I do... Shall I die? I'm driven to the end. No hope to live. Merciless... Didn't you ask a day off on account of toothache? Can't serve guest but can study. Going to be a teacher? Pardon me please. You're a new comer and already pretending illness only after 2 weeks. A good customer? Why come to this place? Have you no cigarettes? Aren't you hungry? Poor stupid boy! What do you like? Chinese fried rice? Anything will do. Who is he? Her husband maybe. What sort of man? Fried rice. All right! And one beer. Who's he? He's handsome but looks tired. Why do you grin? I'll hit you. When will you come back? I left the house when you told me to go away. That's your last bottle. Let's go home together tonight. No, not tonight. Then tomorrow. Well. Good afternoon! Oh! Welcome. Have you written yet? Yes. I've sent it yesterday. Full of confidence. Not at all! I've finished and went to Yasuko... She was out. Will you take this to her? Yes, I will. Tonight, I'm going to Hokkaido with him. With Shirasaka? Yes. To see his parents. At last. Congratulation! He won... he wanted. He's a good person. He's not very reliable, but it may last long. Oh! Hello! Congratulations! Thank you. Reasonable greetings from you. He's become a little more kind. Is it alright about my stories? Excuse me. Good luck to you. Is Miss Hayashi in? It's very nice of you to call on me. I got your letter. The earlier the better I thought. Please come in. Nice house! You couldn't speak ill of me even a single word, could you? Can't I call it a splendid house? Much better than those lodgings. He's my husband. How do you do. I'm Yasuoka. I've known her ever since she lived in Hongo. I'm Fukuchi. Isn't he well? No. Tuberculosis. I wrote to you after thinking it over and over again. Can't manage the sum you want. I brought only 20 yen here. I always make unreasonable demands on you. Oh, no! I was rather pleased you remembered me. Thank you very much. It's a great help. Fumiko, what's that? For your medicine. Well, I see. Please thank him. He's been so good. Don't be so formal. Ah! What are you doing! So I hit her. I don't want to sell my wife's chastity. Who else lend us money? I've borrowed as much as I can. I earn no tips, sold nothing. No other way than asking him. He loves you, I know. If to love to be kind are the same thing. Get money by using love for her husband? She has not the least affection for me. We're merely old friends. I don't like to borrow blindly. Yet, I have to borrow money. You know the fact yet you live on that money. What? Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Never come to you again. You, madman. I'm sure I can live quite well without you. "Come to me if you're lonely" You said so proudly. But it was you who came to me every 2 or 3 weeks. What! Get away! I won't be cheated again, even if you ask me in tears. Or with a smile or a shout. I don't care for you any more. I don't know you! I don't know you! Wonderful! 'A wandering Life' Fumiko Hayashi Is it really her work? Day after day she was writing so seriously. How much you will get from it? Well... Let me see. Fumiko, you've a guest. A lady. It's you! Good afternoon! Why did you call me here? Stop! Don't use violence. Congratulations, Fumiko. Thank you... I had no intention of coming here. But Kyoko asked me to be a witness. Witness... You exaggerate. No, I don't. I'm sorry I was a little late bringing your story to Yasuko. Do you think you can be over with sorry? Delivered 10 days after the deadline. 10 days... Such much late? Your story had been chosen for publication and we needed no more manuscript. I thought Kyoko couldn't write... so I didn't urge her. She took her work back anyway. Nobody reads her work. Lost chance that may never come again. When I got her manuscript I thought what would I do if mine was inferior to hers. I had no intention to let it be delayed purposely. I left him that night. I put your story in my parcel and left the house. I should have sent it to Yasuko that night. Badly wanted to read it through. I intended to send it on the following day. But I got no job at any cafe. Days passed before I found a place in a cheap hotel. So, you kept the story and the deadlines passed. I'll give up writing forever! I never wanted to stop you. What shall I say... My fate... My wandering fate... has interrupted your chance. Stop talking you say! Your don't rely on others for it. 'Help yourself', you want to say... That'll be enough, Kyoko. You've stepped your first step. But remember... Not everybody would bless you. This is not especially for you. For most people... The higher the mountain, the stronger the wind. Stride ahead, step by step. Let's try our best. Let's go now Kyoko. I'm surprised. Terrible woman. Mine is better and I've beaten her. That's true. Don't be beaten. I won't be Still working. Don't you want to sleep? The noise of my pen is disturbing you? If I wanted, I wouldn't hear it. You'll let me write? Unbearable to think someone is working while you sleep. Our exhibition coming soon. I'm irritable. Are you a painter? Not an independent painter yet. I'm writing day and night. Even if my fingers hurt, I won't stop writing. It will hurt your eyes to write in this dark place. Let me see. I've some tools. I'll hind it for you. Is it tiresome? It's interesting. It's wrong to say interesting. You've had bitter experiences. I never asked anybody to read my manuscripts. Nor to have them bound by another person. First experience. Thank you. Simple job! Hide me, please. What's the matter? Where has she gone? That whore came in here, didn't she? No such girl here. If you hide her, you'll be punished, too. Awake and stand up, everyone! Get up! get up! Stand up! I've caught you. I say stand up! She's not a street-girl... was sleeping with me. Think I don't know what one look like. Are you in her gang? Neither I nor she are prostitutes. Come with me. She is not that sort. Come along with me. Wait a moment, please. What? She's not a whore. She's a writer. Writer? Here's her story, just finished. Her name? Fumiko Hayashi. Fumiko Hayashi? Never heard of it. Come on! Officer... Want to come? Don't worry, Mr. Painter. Sounds interesting. Good experience! Keep my story, will you? Don't forget. Rising star in the library A Wandering life - Fumiko Hayashi A WANDERING LIFE Coming-out party Nice? Selling her own tale of poverty. And the world welcomes it. We'll dry up if we take no food like that. Was she loved by so many men? The heroine is always a beauty. The printer said to be very kind to her. No special relations with her. Nearly closing time? Neither Date, nor Fukuchi came after all. Kyoko didn't come either. She's decided this morning. You've come! Welcome! Came to offer congratulations to her. You'd better not... I think it's alright. Go on! My name is Fukuchi - appearing in 'A Wandering Life' by Miss Hayashi. I am the model of a cruel and effeminate man. What shall I say about this book? To praise or criticize... depends on the result of her work. Once we were a couple but now strangers to each other. Admit her as a writer, I myself can be also a writer even if talentless... Let me see it as though strangers to each other. Fumiko... Remember Shirasaka's words came from hatred of your poems? "Just like stirring a dust-bin," "and scattering the contents." I agreed with him. But lately... I read them over again with hatred and found that scattered contents of the dust-bin... are a true beauty, not of false. Fumiko. 'A Wandering Life' is a fine work. But a bit too many tears to make one weep. And in some parts, you draw me as a bad man. I conclude with a quote from you. "Anything can't be of any help." Congratulations for your book. I praise your talents and efforts. Congratulations! Fumiko, you were completely judged up by Fukuchi. Can't help it. Now the stage is open for you. Do your best! Win or lose, only by writing. I will write! If I won't, people will say that 'A Wandering Life' is my sole work. 'A Wandering Life' is not all of myself. Mere 'A wandering Life' is not all of me. The year 1951 When did you come? Been here with no lunch. She ignores the deadline. 4 pieces for magazines 2 novels for the papers! Healthy woman! Whenever I see her picture in the papers I remember the old days. I've got old now. She invited me to live with her. I came up from the country. She gave me these funny clothes. Anniversary service? No, this is for daily wear. Although I don't like this style, I'm not allowed to take it off. Oh, I see I'd prefer country wear. better keep a tabacco-shop or so, but... She's probably seen a noble lady in that style, somewhere. She wanted to let you wear that... All through her happy times. She was wishing and dreaming of it. I'll wear it if Fumiko is pleased. This is not for a person of today. Sorry! I kept you waiting Mr. Yasuoka. Mother. It looks good on you. Very noble style. Like Yozeiin in the '47 Ronin'. Think it funny? Don't think so. Come this way, please. Men from the publishers and newspapers are waiting for you. Serve them tea and cakes and say you're sorry, Mother. You may take it off as it's hot today. Yes, thank you. Really, you're very busy. I refuse they say I consider myself a real writer. I heard you became a company president. A small printing shop. To avoid heavy taxes. You used to help me kindly, If it was not for you, I should have died of hunger. You're really a good-natured man. Because I loved you. Strange person you are. How about your wife? I didn't marry... Simple life. Hope not because of me. Don't be concerned. After the death of my wife, I preferred to be single. Attracted by you a little. Please be at ease. Excuse me. Three men came to see you. Who? One from a charity society. Society to help the poor, then refuse him. The poor must work. No other way for them. It's the Society for Handicapped Children. You may contribute a small sum Then a man came up from Kagoshima. He says he's your father cousin. He asks to let him stay here tonight. Let him stay at hotel tonight. Ask him to leave tomorrow. Give him travel expenses. Next is a young man from a literary group. Asking for monthly help: as you're in sympathy with the poor. Call him a fool! Must work and earn money for his own magazine. Do you think I'm cruel. No. Please tell me the truth. One only knowing the present you... might call you a cold person. Nobody knows you've experienced the pain of starvation. There are no relatives, no strangers for a person in this world. Born alone and to die alone. Unless he helps himself, who will help him. Pardon my preaching to you, a writer. You're very pale. I didn't sleep yesterday. Nor the day before yesterday. Take care of yourself. Thank you. May I see your garden? Of course. I'm collecting azaleas. Really? Welcome home. You'll catch cold. Haven't you slept? I wanted to... Take care of yourself. Yes. I'll sleep now. It's all right. Resting always makes it better. Short is the life of a flower. Hardship ever hangs upon me.
