Hello? Vincent? - Mum— - What is it? Has something happened? - I don't want to be here. - I've tried to call you, but Dad changed your numbers, so don't hang up. - Mum— - Can you give Elina the phone? - I don't want to be here. Mum! The number has no subscriber or is temporarily disconnected. Welcome to the voicemail— Hi. You're having Sunday coffee, right? I need to talk to the kids. - No, that's not possible. - I can wait until the guests are gone. - He gets upset when you leave. - And if he's not allowed to see me. - Get on the train and go home. Mum! Hello? - Hello. I'm outside. I'm not allowed to see the children. This is all I have. I think it's best you're not here tomorrow. Vincent? What the hell are you doing? Don't you think I know where you are? You have the brain of a four-year-old. If you're not gone by tomorrow You won't be taking care of any children. Vincent! Hey! Vincent! - Look. Here. For you. Vincent! - Why were you crying when you called? - Vincent? Vincent! Hi. - I'm just going out. I don't have time right now. - Vincent called last night crying and scared but then it was disconnected. Mattias has got them unlisted numbers, so I can't talk to them. Something's happening but I don't know what. - I have to go. - So do I just let it go? If you're a decent parent— - There doesn't have to be a problem because the children are upset. Children often are when the parents are in a custody battle. Especially if they have a mother who's— yes, chosen to move away from them, plus— You have to put your own feelings aside when you have children. - Mattias is sabotaging this. I've only been allowed to see them once since last summer. - That's not the picture Mattias paints. - What he says about me isn't true. Which of us will get them then? - The children were born here, grew up here and go to school here. So the parent has to adapt. In most cases they do. - I can't live here. I can't even get a job here. - You have to wait a week and see what the verdict is. I can do no more. Say I'm waiting for the verdict here and will meet the children after school. Hi. Is it possible to rent something at this time of year? Hello? - Hello, Alice. I talked to Mattias. He doesn't want you to meet the children by yourself. But he has agreed to a supervised visit tomorrow. You can have 45 minutes with the children at his parents' house after school. But this is the last time we'll be able to arrange something like that. How are you doing? - Fine— But of course you'd tell me or— or another adult if things aren't going well? You know I'm always there. If there's anything— - No, you're not. - Do we have to sit here for 45 minutes? - No, no. - Vincent, come on. - Go with Elina, Vincent. - Are you ready? Well— Go home. You have to take them away from there. I can see things aren't right. - Alice, I can't discuss this. - I can't talk to them when Siv is sitting there watching. I want you to take them away from there. Do you hear me? - We've submitted it. Our report, we've submitted it. We think Mattias should have custody. Elina says she doesn't want to live with you. They will accept that. If there's no new information about the children. Sorry, hello. I need to talk to Vincent. - Only Mattias can collect him. - Yes, but—I'm not collecting him. Something's happened, so I just need to talk to him. - Vincent? Come here for a minute. - Thanks. - Has something happened? Come on. Come on. Alice! You shouldn't be here. - I know. That's why we're going. - What? - We're going to Tenerife. - No! - It's no problem if you miss a week. I'm your mother, Elina. I can do this. You have the right to be with me. - Go yourself. I'm going to call Dad. - Give me a week. One week. Come along. Come on. How many pools are there? - Lots, I would think. Isn't Elina coming? Next stop: Boden. Elina, don't do that. Last call for boarding flight ST708 to Tenerife. Elina? One, two, three, four, five, six— 17. - I counted 19. - What? How? - Just counted. - Hello. - Well hi! - Cool! How are you? - Just fine, thanks. Yes. - Be careful there at the edge. - Nice to have kids the same age around. - Seriously. Great fun. - Do you still live up in Vuollerim? - We live in Vuollerim, but my mother lives in Stockholm. - Stockholm? - Quite a way. - So you have to travel a long way now? - No, we only live with Dad. But they'll be moving down soon, so then it'll be better. Easier. - Will we? - Yes. That's what we're working on. Elina? Sometimes parents can be embarrassing. - Are we embarrassing? You don't think so? - No. So, wow! This is completely—sick. Pick one. - Are we going swimming? Will we have our own room? - Of course you get your own room. - And a computer? - Yes, absolutely. - Where are you living now then? - I rent a flat from a friend who's away. - Are you going to buy your own? Or maybe a house? - Buying's a bit difficult, but— You know Vincent's only playing along to be nice? - I'll get you! - No! Elina! Jump in! Do you want to tell me why you were crying when you called? What are you writing? Is it a diary? Is it schoolwork? - I write down everything that happens. So that nobody can distort it later. What should we have then? It's so difficult with menus. What do you want? Shall we go for the banana split? It's good. Hola! Three banana splits, three watermelon alcohol-free cocktails, please. Did you see that? I can speak Spanish. What? You didn't know? Good, or what! But—Did you know there's a whistle language here? So that they can talk to each other between the mountains. Or like this. Now they come with Coca-Cola! It's true. I whistled wrong. I said cocktail, I said cocktail. Taste. Yummy. If you could choose— If you could choose, would you want to stay with me or Dad? - If you're going to keep on with questions like that, we can't stay here. Come on. Do you want to sleep in my bed? - Dad says he should sleep in his own bed. - I love you. You're going to lose now. You know that? They think you're mentally ill. - Am I? - Dad says you're kind of psychotic. - Do you believe that? He comes out with so much shit. He'll say anything to ruin things for me. He's a psychopath. He's a psychopathic mythomaniac. - He's not lying about you moving out and leaving us. Elina? Want to go for a swim? Can I have the map? Hello! - Hello. Can Vincent stay here with you for a couple of hours? Or have you something else planned? - Well—Yes, we— - We— Gorgeous. Do you want it? These two—Which one? Hi. This one, thanks. Wonderful. I'm not that hungry. Can I go? - You don't have to pretend to me. - What? - It'll be so damn hard eating with you every day. Stay. I've had it too. You are so—wise and good. What you're doing is very dangerous. This disease eats you up. Does Mattias know? - If you talk about this again I'll call Dad and tell him where we are. Elina? We don't need to see any of these people again, so— Come on, come on! Let's go, let's go! I think we have the first singer. Please, come with me. Come on. This is going to be embarrassing for me. Elina, hear what it is? Come on. Come on! Elina. Vincent, you know this one. Come on, please. Wasn't that fun? You sang really well. You'll go to jail. Several years in jail— If you don't come home with them now. Do you understand? Hi, Alice. This is Eva Geijer from Geijer & Widing. Mattias' lawyer said that if the children are not back tomorrow— he'll report you to the police. So you're in a very bad situation right now. If you don't have any new information that gives you a reasonable defence. If I show this to social services and tell them Dad isn't helping you— then you'll be able to stay with me. If things aren't right with you— - Give me the phone. - I have to document— - Delete the pictures. - I can't do that, Elina. - It's from training. If you show them to anyone, I'll never talk to you again. I realize I went too far. Sorry. I'll delete the pictures. I promise. They disappear. Okay? I'm not going to say anything to anyone, but then we'll stay here. - But what if we don't want to stay here? - Your father has reported me to the police. - So what do you think? Where are we going to live? - I don't know. I'm doing everything I can. - Do you want to know why Vincent called? His hamster died. Look, Mum! Cool. It was really cool. - Aren't you the one who's wanted? Yes it is, you can see it's you in the pictures. It's in Aftonbladet, it's on Facebook. It is you. - Go away. - Everyone knows it's you. If it's not you, I can show it to everyone, because it's not you anyway. - Go away! - It is you. - Hey—What are you doing? - Hello. - Hello. Sorry, but— I think you saw something on Facebook or whatever? I just want to say that my children's father is a really difficult person. I have to shield them from him right now. We're in a bit of a tough situation. I hope you won't tell him where we are. Okay? Thanks. Bye. The police are looking for a pair of siblings who are 8 and 14 years old. The police have released these photos and are appealing to the public for help. Elina is about 160 cm tall and has reddish-brown, curly hair. Vincent is 125 cm tall with dark blonde hair. They live in Vuollerim and were collected by a relative, but didn't arrive home. That same evening their father reported them missing. Yes, that's him. Stop it! Let her go! Get out of here! Go away! Go! Go away! What you did is fucking life-threatening! Don't you understand? You can cause permanent brain damage if you stop someone breathing! - You're hurting my arm. Sorry. Sorry. Okay? Can we agree that we won't say anything to Dad about this? - Well? - I want to go home. - Yes. But we're not going home. - I want to go home. - We 'll stay here and have fun. - But it's not fun. - No. - I want to go home. This is a mess. Taking the kids like that doesn't help anyone. This is the sort of thing a sick person does. I really hope I get them home before she manages to hurt them. My neighbour had one when I was little that sounded like a microwave. It kept saying Ping, ping. If you want we can move to another hotel. With the bird. Do you like that one? Yes, it looks nice. Hello. Careful with the cage. Mum, come here! I think it's scared. - Okay, we're going. It wants to come home with us. Elina! Elina! Spit out what's in your mouth. Spit it out! Come on! Spit it out! Spit it out. Spit out what you have in your mouth. - It's a Tic Tac! I'll deal with this. - Hello. What's your name? - Vincent. - You know there's a reason we don't live with you? Everyone at home talks about you. It'd be better for us if you just went away. I couldn't stay. You shouldn't be together if you don't love each other. And it was very stupid, but I fell in love. Quite simple. I'm sorry it turned out like this. - I want to call Dad. Can I call Dad? Mum? Mum? Was it good talking to Dad? I didn't say anything. - No, here. Come on. - What's his name then? - I don't know. - Olof. Come back, come here. Here. This is where you should be. Come on then, Lukas. Come on. Come on, Bertil. Come on, Pip. What was his name, the Tic Tac guy? - Manuel. - Come on, Manuel. - Come on, Lukas. - Come on, come on. - Can't we go out somewhere? - We can do that, let's go. One, two, three. No! Yes, come on. Three, two, one, zero! Wouldn't it be wonderful to live here? Vincent! If you could choose any name you wanted, what would it be? - Like what? - Anything. Maybe we could all change names. - Maybe Jack Sparrow. - Absolutely. I agree. - What about you? I know what you'll say. - You know what it is? What is it? Tell me. Tell me! - Astrid. - Astrid? - No no. - Astrid! Maybe we'll look at a school later with Jack Sparrow. We'll do it. Can we talk somewhere? - You're mentally disturbed, sick. They're coming home with me now. - Is that what they want? - Yes, they want to. Elina called me. - Get your stuff! - Sit still. - You've been reported to the police. You do know that? - Have you asked what they want? - Stop. Stop it! - What do you want? Do you want to be with me or Dad? - Do you want to go? You can choose. - Vincent, come on. You can sleep in my room. We'll pick up your things now. Elina, come on. - This is my week, Mine and the kids'. We're on holiday. It was great until you arrived. - I'm calling the police. Okay? If— If I had them every other weekend, then we could see— - That's not possible. - They're afraid of you. Did you know that? - You've just made that up. It's all in your head. It's not true. - You've no intention of taking care of them. Your mother will take care of them— - If you were to be completely honest— do you think the children would be fine living with you? - Yes. - Children need stability, they need security, a home. They need a parent they don't have to sacrifice everything to be with. They need an orderly life. Most people would agree. - Elina isn't well. Did you know that? Hello? Mum. Wake up. - Dad is talking to the police. - Mum! - You go. It's all right. - I don't want to go with him. I don't want to go with him! Please! Mum, it's all right. It's good. - How long do we have to stay here? - 'Til tomorrow, then— Then I'll find another place. - Then what? - Then we go—Then we go to Norway. Go to school and find a job. What? What?! - Come on. There wasn't very much that was edible. Want some? No. Or biscuit crumbs? Listen, I really need to know— why you don't want to be with Dad. I can take it. - It feels like if we aren't with you— then maybe you'll do something stupid. Hi. I think it's best if you come and pick up the kids. Could you tell us a story? - Anything. Just a story. - Have I told you about when I was with a medium? Haven't I? I was—around 20 and me and my friend Pia were in London. She wanted to go and— I don't believe in mediums, but Pia does, so I thought I might as well give it a try. I went in and there was this woman sitting there surrounded with incense and stuff. She said I would meet a handsome man and have two amazing children. Then a major problem would get in the way. But everything would work out in the end. And just as I was getting up, she says: "Do you want to know why you always get completely white fingers when you're cold?" "Because you froze them on a polar expedition in a previous life." A year or so later I'm at the cottage skiing and there's a snowstorm. I can't see anything. I have no idea how to get home. I don't know what to do in such a situation. It's your Dad— It's your Dad who knows about that stuff. I'm going round in circles getting more and more tired, colder and colder. My fingers are completely white. And then I think: Well, I might as well bivouac. So I do. I cut out blocks of snow. Then put up the sticks with little red sweet wrappers on. And then I wall myself in under the snow. But when I lie down I think: How do I know how to make a snow bivouac? How do I even know what it is? Have I been on a polar expedition? Or what? Right, this is what's happening. The police are coming to pick me up now. I have to go now. You stay here, and Daddy will come in. Police! No! Mum! No! Mum! Can they wait here? I had to rebook. I can withdraw the report. I can take it back. If you come home with us. You have to come home with us. - I can't move there. - Fine, but then you give them up. - No. - You give up the children. - Go home with them. Take care of them. Be good to them. - I'm giving you one last chance here. - No. You're not. This has to end now. No, she doesn't want to. You can go. Hi, Mum. I just wanted to say we're home now and to see how you are. Mum? - Yes? - How are things? Can you have a telephone and stuff? - Yes. And I'm out. - So you do the whistle language and live life to the full? - I go swimming. - Where, in the sea? - Yes. Isn't it completely dark? - Yes. It's completely dark.
