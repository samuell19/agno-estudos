Yes, Sir, Why haven't you gone yet? Hey, Captain, I have a question, Captain? Why did we get rid of the dog man,,, just to snatch this can? Because more witnesses mean more trouble,,,, that's why, Jack And we want to write our own story, Don't let people think the child has just fallen into our laps, There is one more question, Why don't we take the body? Because everything he had, he gave to the boy, Jack, you think they're just chilling,,, on the battlefield? That's when he spread the information, I'm certain, Captain, I checked the boy,,, and he is clean, Jack, all we have to do is leave it to intelligence, They have their own way, Then, we don't just escape, military court,,, will pin a lot of medals on our chest, Look at you,,, want to be a great hero, I can see it, shining, "American Sniper Hero, Win the War" sniper, Skipper, plural, Yes, we'll see, There she is, The ghost, Can this can move again?
