I was almost hoping they would catch me, like my nana used to before she died. I never went out on her boy. She used to give me that look, you know what I'm saying? She was this old Italian female, off the boat and shit. She had this wooden spoon and when you wasn't looking, right, she'd whack you on the hand. I hit you because you look like you was thinking about doing something. I was like your nana, I didn't do nothing. She would be like, Never lie to me, or else I will kill you. You think you want to do it? I don't know man, maybe. I wouldn't worry about it. If Tony couldn't do it, I know you definitely can. oh man. I don't want to hear that shit.

But I'm just saying, when you like put a gun to your head and you're finger's on that trigger at that last second, that you're about to think about doing it. I'm just telling you, that's what happens. I want you to try it. Put a gun to your head, put your finger on the fucking trigger. I want to see what if you can do it. My dad ain't going to do shit.

Do the little lets take a light walk in the woods or a little light necking under the bleachers. Cherie? Neck lightly? Come on, she tongues him first and gives him a giant hickey before she even goes. Besides, she likes it under the bleachers anyway. So, how many will this make for you? Um, twelve. What? The guys think we're sluts anyway, who cares. Tear him up, girlfriend. Tear him up. He's all mine. So what are you up to? You better catch up. And you better catch up! Remember, always spit.
