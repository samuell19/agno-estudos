(dance music playing) -(people cheering) -(crowd chanting): Party Boat! Party Boat! -Man: Attention, Lake Everett Seniors! Let's get wild! Let's get weird! But let's not get pregnant! -(cheering) -(crowd chanting): Party Boat! Party Boat! -Come on! Ha ha! -Hey, you! -Oh, man. -Promise me no one dies tonight! -Listen. We are five years in, my man. -Nobody's died yet. -That we know of. -If no one dies on my last night, I'm gonna be real disappointed. -You've been threatening to quit for three seasons now, Kiley. I don't think it's gonna happen. -Hey. Did you guys go to our school? -No! -Yes! -Best friends since fifth grade. -Fourth! Fourth. -We are living proof that with a little bit of hustle and some luck-- -And a predatory loan. -All your dreams can come true! -That is the best dream ever! -It is. Aim high! -Whoo! -That's what we do, Sean! We make dreams come true! Unh. -(hip hop music playing) -(cheering) -Oh, yeah! -Whoo! -(music continues) -Three, two, one! Go! -(cheering) -That was pretty cool. -That was awesome. -(indistinct shouting) -(laughing) -Kiley: Hey, guys! Look alive! -(music continues) -Sean: Get in there. -Man: What the hell? -What, do you guys live here? -Oh, yeah. Pretty cool, huh? -Sad-cool, maybe? -Shut up! Do you know how much trouble we would get into if lake patrol boarded us and found this stash? -It's a lot. What kind of drugs are those anyway? -Combination Locks. -Both: What the hell is that? -It's Adderall mixed with molly mixed with acid. It's like a combo meal, extra fries. Kinda makes your brain just...lock. -Max: Hmm. -Then you're flying high! -Oh, you're flying high, huh? -Too bad we're gonna have to confiscate them. Give me that! -What? -Sean: That's right. -You heard me right! -Max: Get out. -No! -Back to the party, man. -Smoke some weed or something. -Those are the breaks! -Damn! -We definitely have to take some of these. -We are definitely throwing those in the lake. -Awww. -Immediately. -Sean. -Max. -Sean. -Max. -Sean. -Max! -Fine. -(music continues outside) -Can't waste these. Who needs aspirin? -(pills rattle) -(music continues) -(people cheering) -You really want to leave all this behind? -Can't be afraid to move on, Max. -But nothing's gonna change, right? It'll be you and me, like always. -Always! -First mates forever! -Max: Well, well, well. Who is this stranger? Ah. It's my birthday bestie! What's up? -Maximus! -You ready to party tonight? -Absolutely! -Hey, let me see that rage face! -(chuckles) -(Kiley laughs) -All right, ditch your fuzzies. Let's go. -Yeah, but I gotta clean the boat, so... -You never clean the boat. -I'll be right down! -Kiley: Uh, did Greg get you the final guest list? -Sean: He did. And the wine list. And the appetizer list. And the playlist. -Yeah. -Hey, Kev, how we lookin'? -Clear skies. Calm waters. -Awesome. -Max: Can't lose. -Anyway. Um. Sorry. Dr. Greg loves his lists. -"Dr. Greg." Don't you mean "Orthodontist Greg"? Hey, by the way, have you ever told him that you actually worked on this boat? I mean, he is your boyfriend. -Uh-- Yes. Yes. Obviously. -Hmm. -He doesn't know all the stories. -Oh! -Because he would run scared if he knew all the shit I got up to with you guys. -Well, then let's call him-- -No, absolutely not! -Seriously! Sailor's code, dude! -(chuckles) -All right, let's go. -Cool, yeah, no, I'll just... clean up everything, as always. -Thanks, dude! -(sighs) -Man: Tonight, Sean. I'll have you in handcuffs. Not "soon." Tonight, Sean, and your little dog too are going down. You know, Sean-- -(knocking on door) -What? What? For the love of God! Every time! -Hey, buddy! -How's it going, Walsh? -It's all right. -My god. This is janky. You wanted to see me? -I did. Lock that door, would you? There's two locks. Lock both. One's a bolt. The other one's in the door handle right there itself. Just-- we wanna be snug as a bug...in two rugs. How long you been on the force, Hicks? -You mean lake patrol? Three days. -You know, most partners only last one week with me. -What happens to them? -They tap out. Choke's a choke. HR gets involved. It's, it's better to just cut 'em loose than go to trial. What brought you, uh, to LALP? You love the lake? Search for justice? -Craigslist. -Craig's a good guy. Tell him I said hi, okay? -It's a website. Do you live here? -No. Live here? No. I got a big house. No. -There's a bed. There's, like, drool stains on the pillow. -'Cause I was sound asleep. You take a lot of all-nighters that you gotta pull here. A lot of surveillance work. You could take a nap if you want. You're probably tired, out in the sun all day. I'll lay with you if you're frightened. -I'm good. -Okay. -Why is your pans all crusty? You cook here? -Yes, I cook. I cook quesadillas. I cook mean quesadillas. You can have a quesadilla. I'll cook one for ya. I'll clean the pot first. And the pan. And then you probably can sleep here. You can lay down and take a nap. I'll lay with you -in case you get frightened. -I'm good. -Is that piss? -You can go if you want. It's all right. It's just two dudes. It's all right. It's totally normal. -What's-what's that bucket for? -That's composting. -You don't wanna go near that-- -Ugh! -That's shit! -You take the feces of other animals for the benefit of a garden. You know what? Yes! I live here. Okay? And I'm proud of it. You know why I live here? 'Cause of that white boat. And these two assholes-- Well, he's an asshole. He's kinda handsome in a cool-- They think they run the lake. But they don't run that lake. Hicks, I run that lake. But you wanna know what this is right here? This is my golden ticket for that white boat. This is the Lake Council telling me I have full authority to bring those assholes and burn 'em to the ground, tonight! So if you're in, if you're down with the job, cop a squat, take a leak, drain the train, have a quesadilla, take a nap, I'll lay with you if you want, because tonight, we roll. Let's go buzz their tower! -Okay. -Max: Hey, wait, wait! Slow down, white lightening! Wait, Kiles, hold on! (panting) -Hold on. -Sad, Max. -Yeah, I know. Oh! Oh, please, come on. It's not like Dr. Supercuts can keep up with you either? -Greg ran track at Trinity. -Of course he did. -Dude... I really need you guys to be friends if this is gonna work. -I need to be friends with that guy like you need to adopt more puppies. -Don't talk smack about my pups. I'm ride or die for those bitches. -You really serious about this whole thing? -I don't know. Sometimes it feels like I'm faking it. Running a shelter. I guess I wish I could be back on the boat mixing drinks with you guys. -Well...I know a guy who can make that happen. -(laughing) -But I was actually talking about you and Greg. -He is the sweetest, most supportive guy I've ever met. I think I found someone really special. -Ah. -Can you just try to be nice? Please? At least for tonight? -Yeah. Fine. But...only because... -Oh, my god. Oh, my god. You're so gross. -...I love you so much. -Gross. Gross. Gross. Gross. Gross. -Oh, God, get off. -Let's go. God, you sweat like Trump's ball sack. -Well, yeah. -All right. One more mile. -Okay. -Try to keep up. You're getting slow in your old age. -You got this tonight, Sean. This is a big party. This is one of our biggest. What do we got? Smooth jazz, check. Pinot Grigio, check. -Walsh: Officers boarding vessel. -Mm-hmm. What do you want, Walsh? -French vanilla? Creamer? You're a pussy. Where's your partner? -Sean: He's running errands. -Oh, really? Ooh! Looks like you guys are in line for another shitshow tonight. -That's nice. -Actually, sorry to disappoint. Tonight's a classy party, hosted by a locally respected doctor. -Oh, he's an orthodontist, actually. -I don't care if it's Sean's mom's vagina doctor. Doesn't matter. I've been waiting for this moment for ten years. -This is my moment! -What moment? -What moment? I just got word from the Lake Council you guys haven't paid any of your fines. You guys are in the hole, uh-- what's the number up to now, Hicks? -I think like eighteen grand, sir. Eighteen thousand dollars. -First of all...don't talk about my mom. -Or Dr. Nancy. -Second, we're gonna have the money. -Why do you know the name of his mom's gynecologist? You don't think that's odd? How are you gonna get the money if I ding you with citations tonight. If you guys screw up, and you will screw up. -Mayday, mayday, mayday. -Not gonna happen. -Mayday! -It's not gonna happen! -Mayday. -Becky: Hey, guys, where should I put these fireworks? It says it's "illegal in the contiguous United States." Huh. Thank God we're on a lake. -Also, I opened up the tramp... -Max: Hey. Hey. Hey. ...for... (clears throat) -Why don't you go upstairs for a second. I think I saw a, uh, Teletubby. -Becky: Yeah, yeah, totally. -This is going to be so easy. Come on, Hicks, let's go. Come on. Hicks! -I freaking hate that guy. -Seanie, why have we not been paying our bills, man? -Uh, it's the fines, Max. The fines that your party tricks keep sticking us with. -Me? -Yeah. Bobbing for lobsters. We got a fine for it. What about the Mermaid Olympics? Remember that? Human catapult? -That was awesome. -No, that was awesome. That was-- that was pretty cool. Look, man, we got into this business together as equal partners, man, and I'm doing everything I can to keep us afloat but the fines are crushing us. Kiley's party is the payday we need. So for one night, I need you to help me, okay? We have to keep things low-key and we have to keep Walsh off this boat. -All right. Fine. I got you. Hey, first mates forever. Two times. -Two times. Mm. First mates forever. All right, cool. Checklist: Gas? -Yeah. Absolutely. Man, you run out of gas one time-- -It was three-- -Three times. -That's right. Uh, did you fix the door on the lower deck? -Come on, man. This is Kiley we're talking about. You don't think I want tonight to be perfect? I think that I'm like this close to getting her back on the crew. -It's been two years. She's rescuing puppies now. Listen, I'm gonna say this to you as your best friend, okay? You gotta let her go. Hey! Pick up a bag! -(grunting and screaming) -We have to be prepared for anything when we're out there, Hicks. Tonight... (exhales forcefully) Look at this horse stance. Look at this! Anything at all, buddy. That's why we train. (screaming) -That's right, buddy. Come on, let's train. -Nah. Calm down. We're just lake patrol. You know that. -Just lake patrol? Is that what you're gonna say when you're-- when you're out in the shit, tonight? "I'm lake patrol." You gonna take a selfie? Put it in your wifi cloud? Is that what you're gonna do? -No. -(Walsh screaming) -I'll probably just tweet it. -Suit yourself, lazy. What? No, I'm talkin' to Hicks there, Sean. What? (screaming) What was that, Sean? (screams) What was that? Hey, Max? Wanna eat a dick? Whoa! (laughing) Hey, Sean! He's tall. Sean's taller. Upwards. To the Adam's apple. He falls towards you? Little shoe shine on the way down. (screaming) Hey, Sean. (screaming) Ooh! Ooh! Elbows. Right there. Six stitches above the eye. You ever see guys with really cool stitches? It's either hockey or they caught one of my elbows. Right there. (screaming) Why won't you just train with me? -(Hicks sighs) Honestly, I mean, I feel like you're gonna lose your shit and accidentally hurt me, so. -Well, who knows? Right? I don't accidentally lose my temper. Pain is a valuable, valuable lesson. Maybe you could use a lesson or two. -Hicks: I'll get on the boat, I'll write some tickets... but I don't wanna do that. -This is good footwork. That's mat work, man. Mat work's good for ya. Just train. That's the problem with your entire generation, buddy. Got your faces in your phones. Palm strike. Palm strike. Box cutter! You're not gonna learn anything on the internet. That was-- Where the hell did you learn that? -The internet. -(screaming) You don't even know what that's called, do ya? -Yelling? -Can you stretch? Let's see you stretch. Why don't ya go sit down before you get hurt? -You didn't stretch! -A'ight. -(screaming) -Jonathan: Hoo! The ancients believed that every object had a soul. Meet your maker! (yelling) -Oh, that is sweet. -What'd I tell you about playing with knives? -That they're awesome? -Didn't say that. Put it away. -Oh! But I am a fruit ninja! -(yelling) -You are a lawsuit waiting to happen. -You better look alive tonight, because Kiley's gonna be on the boat, and you are already on the verge of being replaced, my friend. -Huh? What's that? -Greg: Ahoy, mateys! -Oh, great, the human mouth guard has arrived. -Keep up the good work, man. -I shall. Always do. -Greg: Hey! There they are. The party boys. -Lookin' sharp, Greg. I like that! -Thank you, good man. You know, I went with the full seersuck -since we're on a boat. -Yeah. -♪ I'm on a boat ♪ -No. No, no, no. Never. Never that song. Never on our boat. -(chuckles) -Greg: Hey, buddy. So we feel good? Special night, right? -Yeah. -Yup, it is. But why are you here an hour early, Greg? -Dr. Greg is always early for his appointments. -(laughing) I just wanted to make sure all our ducks are in a row. -Our ducks are in a row. Aren't they, Sean? -They are, Max. -As a matter of fact, Greg-- -We have bow ties on all the crew. We have smooth jazz on all the speakers and wine in every glass. Trust me, Greg, we're all over it. -Bow ties? -Uh-huh. -Jazz? -Yeah. -I thought Kiley wanted to have her birthday on our boat because she likes the way that we do things, -Sean. -Kiley? Booking the boat was my idea. You know, for nostalgia. I just wanted to remind her where she came from before showing her where we're going. -That's amazing. Isn't that amazing? -What does that mean? -Between us... I'm gonna ask her to marry me tonight. -Greg: Whoo! -(Sean chuckles) -You know, it feels so good being able to say that out loud. -Sean: Wow! Our first proposal. -Big time. Now, I'm gonna need you to help me out and take extra care of my Eomma. -Jesus, Greg. You look like an asshole in that suit. -Welcome aboard, Miss Kim. Uh, hope you brought your dancing shoes. -The Kims don't dance. (sighs) Now, where's the bar? -It's gonna be great. -I like your mom, Greg. -Hey. Are you serious with this? -I am. And, uh, can you hit that top button? -No! -Yeah. Please. How you guys doing? -Oh, hey, welcome! -So I'm thinking, if we wanna avoid Walsh, our best bet is to hug the shore, anchor down in the cove. Yeah, we should be in good shape. -You hearing me, Max? -Were you saying something? Oh, hey! There she is. Ready to get behind that bar, birthday girl? Two times! Unh! -You guys remember my sister, Lauren. -Yeah, sorry about the divorce. Tough break. -Hmm. Screw off, Max. This boat better not sink. -That's for sure. 'Cause I'm paying for the return trip too. Come on, ladies, all aboard! -Get in there! -Kiley: Babe, that suit looks great. -Hey, Max? -Hmm? No! -(softly): Yes. -No, no-- -(engine starts) -(horn blaring) -All right. You ready? You ready to do this? -Yeah. I'm good. -No, you're not good. Yeah, you've got a citation book, but you're forgetting the number one danger out there on that lake, man. What's the matter with you? The sun! You got-- the sun, 'cause the lake reflects all the light up. -So what's this? -Uh... -weird pocket dildo? -I wish! -I don't know. -Sunscreen, buddy. You gotta get lubed up. I can't have you burned. Your tattoos will look like crumbled fresco. It'll look like some kinda weird Jackson Pollock, you know? Here. -So much! -Look up. Look up. -There you go. Now be still... -Oh, God. -be still, don't talk. -What are you doing? -Lubin' up. Ooh. You-- Yeah. A lot of push-ups, I like that. Why are you touching my nipple like that? -I don't know, I didn't expect it to be that long. -Sorry. Here. -Ah! God! -What the hell? -You gotta keep your eyes closed! You're all right. You want a nice tan line. -You got it in my eyes. -Here and I'll rub that in too. It's okay. It's okay. -Oh! -It's okay. -I think I can't see anymore. -Let's go get those assholes. -Okay, let's go. -(soft jazz music playing) -(indistinct chattering) -Look at her, man. That is her "I'm bored as hell but I'm trying to be polite" face. Ugh, it's pathetic. -You know, Max, it's a great thing you and Kiley are just friends and you're totally not in love with her. Otherwise, this news of her impending engagement would be one hell of a punch to the nuts, huh? -I'm not "totally" in love with her. -I guess the great part about being just her friend and, as you specifically noted, nothing more, is that you'll get to help her choose out a wedding dress. And when she's stressed out about the props in the photo booth and her batshit mother-in-law, you'll get to be her totally platonic, non-sexual shoulder to lean on. And once she's married, you'll get to be her confidant. When she's worried that Greg is no longer interested in her sexually-- Enough! -We've just never been single at the same time, and I didn't want to mess up our friendship. Besides, I've been waiting for the perfect moment. -You've been waiting since fourth grade, man! -Yeah, well, there's a lot of elements that go into the perfect moment, Jonathan. Trust me, I'm the party guy. I know a thing or two about "moments." -Okay, well, how about you make one! Okay? Before Mr. Doctor Man wifes her up? -Yeah. -Yeah. -You know what? You're right. But I will need your help. Sean putting us into the cove so you-- -Oh, no can do, buddy. Not to be selfish, but tonight is all about me, whoever the hell that is, and the rest of our lives together. -Don't even bother. Lauren will swallow you whole. -That's the plan. Hey, my name is Jonathan, and I'm here to help you find your smile on this voyage. -Shove that smile up your dick. My husband screwed his life coach and left me with two kids and no child support, so pour me a goddamned whiskey. -Max: Charming as ever, Lauren! One sadness on rocks! -The bottle, Max. -Max: Okay. -Twenty bucks says I take her to the township of pound. Yeah. But if I don't, I get to keep the money. -That's not how betting works. -(slaps butt) -Oh! -I know it. -(groans) -(soft jazz music playing) -Lauren? Hey. You know we're not actually gonna sink, right? -No, we're sinking. We just won't know it until it's too late. -Come on, it's not that bad. -Listen to me, Kiley. You graduate college, and everything's great. You meet a guy. And he's gorgeous and boring and predictable and incredibly safe. And no one ever went wrong with a nice guy, right? That's wrong. Trust me, I know you love Greg, but don't rush into anything. -Are you ready for this? Are you ready? This one is special. I can tell. Did you see the-the anger in her eyes? The hatred in her voice? That's so hot! She's the one, Little J. She's the one. We can't screw this up. Okay, no false starts. No second act slumps. We need to be on top of our game! Now, I'm not gonna lie... I'm nervous. But you can't be, okay? I need you to rise like the sun in the east. Looking sharp, Little J. Looking sharp. (softly): Yeah. (clicks tongue) -(jazz music continues) -Table one, thank you. So far so good, huh? -Yeah, if you like funerals at sea. -Max, don't sta-- -Hey, what do you guys think? Proposal at sunset or under the stars? -Sean: Sunset. -Max: Stars. -All right. I trust you, Max. Stars it is. Sean, on my cue, you play that song, and I'll take care of the rest, okay? -Yes. -I'm excited. -Yeah! -I'm nervous. Should I be nervous? -Of course-- -Yeah, have you thought this through? -Did I think this through? I've been rehearsing this for weeks. -Look, look. Do-Don't worry about a thing. Okay? Everything is set. You're gonna do great. -Yeah, yeah. -Yeah! Come on, man! -(Sean chuckles) -Whoo! -That's an all right dude. -That guy's keeping TJ Maxx in business. -No, don't do that, okay? We need to get paid, Max. And that only happens if Greg walks away happy. -And that doesn't happen if she's having a shitty time. Look at her, man. She's bored out of her mind! Come on. Dr. Greg can do his thing later, okay? Right now, what we need... -is to flip this party. -No. No, no. What about lake patrol? -You had the captain put us in the cove. You don't think we can handle Chuckie Walsh? Come on. Sean? -All right, fine. Just promise me nobody dies tonight. -We've been doin' this for seven years. We haven't lost anybody yet! -(sighs) I'm serious, Max. Shoot. -Hicks: Still nothing. -Walsh: Still nothing? They just pulled into the cove. That's gonna be the crime scene. You just gotta be patient, Hicks! -Why are you always on their case, man? -Because they're the reason I'm standing here on a dinghy with a dinghy that looks like Sammy Hagar's son instead of out there throwing detective cock all over town. -Ugh! -2007, that's when it all changed, my man. 2007-- I don't want these. I used to break up their high school parties. That was me. I was the big bad wolf. "Here comes Officer Walsh, everybody put your cups down and run!" You should have seen the looks on their dumb faces when I came through the woods with my big spotlight. Then I had to stop, I didn't feel like doin' that job anymore and it was a misunderstanding. It's, uh, it's stupid. -Wait, I remember that night. -No. That's impossible. -You're the guy with the big spotlight. -First of all, let's keep our voices down. Because water, sound travels differently than it does, not water. Sean told me a young man needed counseling. So I pulled him aside to counsel him, okay? -Okay, but why was your pants down? -We were in a restroom. Makes perfect sense. Makes perfect sense to me. And a judge. A state judge. Give me these. You know what? Watch this. Look what I'm doing with my eyes. Watch this. You see that? You're not even looking at me. Look what I'm doing with my eyes. Can you do this? I can see just as far as those are. -(tapping on mic) -(electronic feedback) -Hello, attention everyone, up here. Hello, hi. My name is Max. I'm co-owner of this ship, but I also happen to be an old friend of Kiley's. Now, as some of you know, Kiley was a founding staff member of the S.S. Party Boat. And that first summer, our original idea was to just park her at the dock, use her as a floating bar. But it was Kiley who stood up and told us, something that has moved this business forward ever since. She said, "A ship is safe in the harbor, but that's not what ships were built for." Quickly we found out that she got that off of a mug at the marina giftshop. -Wrap it up! -But that is precisely why we love Kiley so much. Because she knows that pursuing adventure is much more rewarding than just sitting safely in some harbor. And she also happens to be the best damn bartender in all of Lake Everett. So watch your back, Jonathan! -(laughter) -Max: So raise a glass. (glasses clinking) To Kiley. -Guests: To Kiley. -(splashes) Now, there is one more thing that Kiley Abigail Miller will not stand for. And that is a boring party, okay? It's time to go off the script a bit. -Off script? -So put down your cellphones, toss your inhibitions, 'cause it's time to boogie! -(High Rollers by Photronique playing) ♪ I'm a jet set player yeah I'm doing life right ♪ ♪ Rooftop party man them flashing lights bright ♪ ♪ Big shot talking girl I do it all night ♪ ♪ Don't stop win it girl let's get it right ♪ ♪ Party in the penthouse Trump Tower ♪ ♪ Private jets any hour ♪ ♪ Day or week ♪ ♪ Dripping all them diamonds diamonds platinum ♪ ♪ In my earrings so classy ♪ ♪ Living like high rollers that one percent ♪ ♪ Yeah we do it how we do it ♪ ♪ And then we do it again ♪ ♪ 'Cause we're the high rollers don't forget ♪ ♪ Yeah we in it just to win it there's no limits we bet ♪ ♪ 'Cause we're the hi-i-i-i-i high rollers ♪ ♪ We're the hi-i-i-i-i high rollers ♪ ♪ We're the hi-i-i-i-i high rollers ♪ ♪ We're the hi-i-i-i-i high rollers ♪ ♪ Call me Cool Hand Luke ♪ ♪ 'Cause man I really can't lose ♪ ♪ Party with my people... ♪ -Hicks: Man, they got some fine mamacitas up there! -I knew it.

There's fish underneath us right now. Fuckin' fish. I go to work with fish. -(sighs) -Hey, what do you bench anyway? Are you a rep guy or a max guy? -(music continues) -Out of my way! -Man: What the hell? -Ken Doll-looking motherfucker. Ma'am? Sorry, I just wanted to make sure you didn't need anything. It can get kind of unsteady out there. -What I need is fresh air. It's rather pungent upstairs. Like sweat mixed with...failure. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to enjoy the view. -(screams) -Max! Eomma overboard! Eomma is overboard! -(both laughing) -Oh, wow! -Oh! When do we get to see your boyfriend's rage face? Does he even have one? -Greg's not much of a dancer. -Well, I'm sure he has plenty of other fun, youthful, carefree qualities. -(laughs sarcastically) -Save me, you mofos! -Don't worry, I got you! -Wait! No! Don't touch me! -What? -Black people can't swim! -Oh! Oh, damn! -(both laughing) -We had fun though, didn't we? -Always. -Um-- -Is everything okay? Are you sick? -Uh... Kiley...ever since we were kids, I've always wanted to tell you-- -Oh, my God, Max. Eomma's in the water. -What? -Loo-- -Okay, okay, okay. Just let me say what I was about to say-- -No, go! In the water! Max, go! Give me the jacket! Just-- -Sean: Max! Max! -Calm down. I'm trying to help! -Hey! I was finally alone with Kiley. It was the perfect moment! What's the matter? You forget how to save old ladies? -She's racist! -She's not racist. She's Asian, man! Asians can't be racist. She's just old. (screaming) -Eomma: White devil! -White devil? -White devil! -She is racist. -What the hell is going on down there? -Um, Greg's Eomma fell overboard. Max went in to save her, but I don't know why there's so much splashing. -Because she's drowning. Lucky bitch. -Don't worry, ladies! I got this under control! BRB. -(Jonathan laughing) -Is that guy slow or something? -Uh, no. He just lives on Planet Jonathan. It took me six weeks to train him. -Oh! Not that asshole too! -Help! I'm a very poor swimmer! -What are you doing out here if you can't swim? -I was trying to impress Kiley's sister! -What? -Help! -I'll save her. You help this idiot. -Max! Don't let me die! -Max: I got you. Max! Don't let me die! -I got you, just stop poking me with your keys. -What keys? -Kiley: Oh, my God! -Nobody panic. I'm a highly trained aquatic professional. I am not gonna let you die! I am not gonna let you die! -Oh! -Oh! -(groans and coughs) -Oh, my God! He's got a boner! -Dude, I was already hard when I started kissing her. -Woman: Kissing her? -What the hell's going on down here? Eomma, are you okay? -Becky: Oh, my God! This shit is going viral! -We're gonna need a bigger boat. -You sure you're okay, Eomma? -I'm fine. Stop fussing over me. -(softly): Do you still have the ring? -You gotta be careful with this.

Look at this. -(music continues) -Cheers. -Mmm. -Whoo! -What do you say we show these people how to really party? -Especially that girl right there. -Right there? Let's go. -Yeah. Let us dance til' dawn! Arrgh! Body roll! Fly, Carmichael. Arrr! -(cheering) -(music continues) -That was the best party of my life! I'm telling everyone you guys rock! -Awesome. -Please let me stay! I wanna live on this boat! -(Sean and Max chuckle) -Thank you. -You don't gotta go home, but you gotta get the hell out of here! -Thank you, guys. Eomma, I hope we showed you a good time. -It was the night of my life. -What the hell was that? That's the S.S. Party Boat weaving its magic, that's what that is. -Uh, should we get breakfast? -It's on me. -Ooh. -(Lauren chuckles) -That guy's crazy. It might work out. -Guys, this is my masterpiece. -Too bad you have to delete that. -Mm-hmm. -Freedom of the press, no way! -What! What happens on the party boat stays on the party boat. -Stays. -Guys, I can't thank you enough. -Oh, Greg, you don't have to do this. Tha-That party was a disaster. -Hey. She said yes, right? Well, technically, she said no, but then you said yes. -I'm a man of my word. -You should really hang out with us more often, Greg. -Really? -Max: Yeah. -It's good with me, matey. -Well, just take it easy on the mateys. Okay? -I'm gonna go catch up with my Eomma, all right? -So, floating wedding next year? Again, about everything, I'm really sorry and-- -Stop it. You threw a great party, and you gave me the greatest proposal story of all time. Anything for my first mate. -Come here. -L-Let go. -Hmm? Oh, yeah. -Let go. -My bad. -Congratulations. -Thanks, I'll see you soon. -Sean: You got it. -Wow. -Yep. Our work here is done. -And nobody died. -Nobody died -(mugs clink) (High Rollers by Photronique playing) -Hey, Sean! -You know what I was thinking? -What's that? -Tahiti. -Tahiti? -Tahiti. -You wanna do Tahiti? -Absolutely. -We should do Tahiti. -Sailboat. -(both grunt) -You like it? -Dude, I love it. -You know what? I do like Tahiti. -I'm telling you man, stick with me, -I'll make all your dreams come true. -We're going places, we're going places. -Max: Tahiti! -(Sean laughs) -We're coming for you, bitches. -Oh, God. -No rush. There's no rush. Hey, Hicks, what's Eddie Van Halen look like in real life? -I don't know. Get to the bed. -Three locks, three locks. -Get to the bed. Get to the bed. -I'm going! You're not even on the bed. -I know I'm not. -Oh, my God. -You know what? You need a quesadilla. You need one. -No, no, no, lay down. Lay down. -Walsh! -What? -Lay down! -I got muenster in the fridge. -Lay down and relax! -I'm relaxed, you're the one that's not relaxed. -Alright, Walsh. I'll see you later. Probably at your hearing. -(laughs) At my hearing. I can hear. Hicksy, slide me over one of those buckets, okay? -Which one? -It's too early to tell. -You know what, just scoot over. You're too wasted to leave alone, and I'm too tired to go home, so... -Big spoon or little spoon? -It's too early to tell. Are you sure this bed is-- Oh, God. -I can smell your sunscreen. -Go to bed, Walsh. -(High Rollers by Photronique playing) ♪ I'm a jet set player yeah I'm doing life right ♪ ♪ Rooftop party man them flashing lights bright ♪ ♪ Big shot talking girl I do it all night ♪ ♪ Don't stop win it girl let's get it right ♪ ♪ Party in the penthouse Trump Tower ♪ ♪ Private jets any hour ♪ ♪ Day or week ♪ ♪ Dripping all them diamonds diamonds platinum ♪ ♪ In my earrings so classy ♪ ♪ Living like high rollers that one percent ♪ ♪ Yeah we do it how we do it ♪ ♪ And then we do it again ♪ ♪ 'Cause we're the high rollers don't forget ♪ ♪ Yeah we in it just to win it there's no limits we bet ♪ ♪ 'Cause we're the hi-i-i-i-i high rollers ♪ ♪ We're the hi-i-i-i-i high rollers ♪ ♪ We're the hi-i-i-i-i high rollers ♪ ♪ We're the hi-i-i-i-i high rollers ♪ ♪ Call me Cool Hand Luke ♪ ♪ 'Cause man I really can't lose ♪ ♪ Party with my people please send me some more goose ♪ ♪ Big yacht pimpin' sipping on some juice ♪ ♪ I can't believe it man my life is true ♪ ♪ Party in the penthouse Trump Tower ♪ ♪ Private jets any hour ♪ ♪ Day or week ♪ ♪ Dripping all them diamonds diamonds platinum ♪ ♪ In my earrings so classy ♪ ♪ Living like high rollers that one percent ♪ ♪ Yeah we do it how we do it ♪ ♪ And then we do it again ♪ ♪ 'Cause we're the high rollers don't forget ♪ ♪ Yeah we in it just to win it there's no limits we bet ♪ ♪ We're the hi-i-i-i-i high rollers ♪ ♪ We're the hi-i-i-i-i high rollers ♪ ♪ We're the hi-i-i-i-i high rollers ♪ ♪ We're the hi-i-i-i-i high rollers ♪ ♪ Living like high rollers that one percent ♪ ♪ Yeah we do it how we do it ♪ ♪ And then we do it again ♪ ♪ 'Cause we're the high rollers don't forget ♪ ♪ Yeah we in it just to win it there's no limits we bet ♪ ♪ 'Cause we're the hi-i-i-i-i high rollers ♪ ♪ We're the hi-i-i-i-i high rollers ♪ ♪ We're the hi-i-i-i-i high rollers ♪ ♪ We're the hi-i-i-i-i high rollers ♪ ♪ Roller rollers rollers rollers ♪ ♪ Rollers rollers rollers rollers ♪ ♪ Rollers rollers rollers ♪
