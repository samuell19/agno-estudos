You leave, I will follow you. Greetings, Mr. Ranger.. Come.. please come.. I was waiting for you. Has Mr. Inder come? He has come, but you are about to go. - What do you mean? - He is angry on you. You should do your work if you are a sub contractor. You take another work leaving the other incomplete. I am sorry. Please help me. What can I do? Say anything. Tell him that my wife expired. And then, my previous wife has really expired. Good morning sir, good morning. Hey.. what is the news? What can I tell you? I am in a very big problem. Problem? Yes.. just fifteen days ago my wife.. Suffered a heart fail suddenly. I will write to the government.. That due to the death of the sub contractor's wife.. The colony will not be completed on time. You will pay the loss. I will die.. I will die. Why will you die, when you wife is there to die? Are you not ashamed to lie? I am just returning from your house. Your wife told me that you are here. Tell me to start the proceedings against him. - Sir.. - Please don't waste my time. Go. Go away from here. Come.. come Prakash.. What happened of the cement? We will not get the permit till fifteen days, sir. Since how many years are you working with me? That permit should come within three days, understood? Come on, Prakash. Come on. We will talk. Good morning, Inderjeet. Please come, Mr. Mathur. Please come. Please come. Yesterday.. See, even you seem someone else. Oh! You really are someone else. Doesn't matter. Will you give me a cigarette? I don't smoke. So, why are you scared about it? It was here.. the packet was here. That woman.. I mean.. that girl.. That girl hasn't gone till now? The madam was not in a state to go. You should have chucked her out. You haven't gone till now? Darling, I am searching for my cigarette packet. I asked you.. why didn't you go till now? You don't scold me like this in the night. This is not night, this is day, dress up.. And go away from the back door. Go. Listen.. Can I get two hundred rupees advance? I want to buy a new perfume. Take this. And go. - When should I come next? - I will call you. Hey, Prakash.. come on, we will go out and sit in the garden. Yes, I want to talk. Who is it? The hands seem to be some girls. The question is.. Out of those five girls, whose is this.. The girls whom I love. Five? Don't laugh! Tell me. Who are these five? You are four, and one is Rama. - When did you come? - Right now.. Let me see.. did Laila get fed well in her in-law's place? Oh.. uncle.. I have been written in such fat letters.. That I can be seen even without glasses. Sir.. Come. Prakash.. come.. Greetings.. Why did you have this laughing fits all of a sudden? - Brother.. - Yes? It seems that someone has told you.. You look more handsome when you look downwards.. Listen to what I say.. Life is not at the feet, but straight ahead. Come.. come.. come.. Prakash. Have a seat. Look at that proof and complete it today. Yes. I will tell you. Your Mr. Greetings is gone. Tell me, Rama. Shall I speak to uncle and arrange the marriage? See, I will tell you. I respect Mr. Prakash. Only respect. And nothing else. Then why don't you tell him not to come here? Why should I tell him? He comes out of his own will to write father's autobiography. He doesn't come here for me. Today was the same as everyday. Can it not be possible.. That I don't have to tell it, and Ms Rama understands it? That everyday, punctually.. I don't come just to take dictation.. Or for a cup of tea? These same matters maybe in these same words.. I had written them yesterday too. And maybe.. I will write them tomorrow too. Yes.. Shankar.. you are doing grave injustice to your eyes. - Not at all. - What not at all? He puts on his glasses and starts reading whenever he gets the time. This is very wrong, Dayashankar. You are well educated. You should listen to the doctor. Child, I have an idea. You keep his glasses in the safe deposit of some bank. - And get this right away. - Father, can I go with Rama too? Yes, go. And tell Lakshmya for tea while going. - Give me the saccharine. - Yes? Give me the saccharine. Child.. it doesn't hurt to have tea with sugar sometimes. You have diabetes, isn't it? You tell others what not to do. And you yourself, keep doing all it. He is very greedy, Rama. He was standing back there.. And eating curds and ice. Did you see that, Dayashankar? Shamshuddin said.. That we will not get ice and curds in heaven. Will a sinner like you get place in heaven? Father.. we will get the medicine.. Yes. Go. Children.. go. Dayashankar.. I didn't tell it in the presence of the children. Your eyes are in a very bad state. I know it.. I know it.. Yes.. yes.. it is very good. Hi, Rita.. Hi.. Salma. I think that you didn't recognize us. Do you remember.. in Vinay Shrivastav's party.. You have such huge eyes. Do we seem to be Rita and Salma to you? Why are you so angry? What is there in the name? Come on, at least we came to now each other. Where are you both going? I will drop you somewhere. - Come on. - That isn't needed. How can that be possible? Your beautiful and fair faces.. Will become black due tot his searing heat. Please come. Do you want to be hit? Yes? Do you want to be hit? Why are you talking? Their level of insolence is directly.. Proportional to the size of their car. Come on. Hey you.. You were going to Lucknow? Guned to Lukhnow - Oh.. uncle you are here, still? - Yes, child. Okay, I have an idea. Please get me a hot cup of tea. I will get it right away. What happened? Prakash.. I saw two beauties in your poor city today. I thought. They were so angry when they heard of the lift.. Your manners is as small as your car! But why did you need to give a lift? You are strange. Two beautiful girls are almost frying in the searing heat... And if I don't give them a lift, what is... the use of keeping such a huge car, yes? As it is.. let me tell you something.. This word lift is a common girl, but is so great. You see some lonely girl going alone.. You stop the car and ask her.. Can I drop you somewhere? Without waiting for an answer you open the door of the car. If the girl has some antics.. Then think that the work is done. The girl is loose. And if she isn't loose.. Either she will say thank you and refuse.. Or she will sit in the car. If she sits in the car, you can ask her name and address... And then.. it is your game. If you ever write my biography.. I will have you write a whole chapter on the art of giving a lift. Yes, tell me now. Where did these two fairies come in your poor city? One was wearing a 'Ghaghra-Dupatta'.. And had betel nuts.. While the other one was wearing a saree. I am more interested in the girl wearing the saree. Set your interest somewhere else. You will not succeed there. How will the work not be done? Even stones melt on the oil of money. You can place a bet. If I don't introduce you to her.. In my bedroom in two weeks.. Money is still smaller than people in a small city. Then you haven't seen the height of money, son. I am tall, isn't it? Girls use ladders and fight to reach my top pocket. But Ms Rama is not like that. Ms Rama? Yes. The one whom you met... is the daughter of our professor Sharma. Okay.. And she will not slip. Why are you so sure about this Ms Rama? Are you having an affair with her? Tell me if it is so, I will go to Lucknow. No.. I don't have any affair but.. But.. then take this but and keep it in your pocket. Will you place a bet? - You will lose. - What? If I loose I'll give you thousand and if I win I'll take One. Why? Are you scared? If I lose, I will give one rupee. And if I win.. Prakash.. Is all right that some people do lie for material gains. But I don't like lies in any form. This world is true. Can I come in, sir? Oh! Prakash.. you here.. Can I come in? Yes, come in.. come in. Who is he, Prakash? Sir.. he is Indra.. Inder Saxena. He used to study with me in college. Oh.. You are the Inder, whom I chucked out of class? Yes, sir. And that day I took up this promise that if I ever become worthy.. Of anything in life, I will surely take your blessings. A few days ago, I had gone to Kashmir on some work. And I brought this for you. What is this? It is a common shawl. Oh! - This is a Kashmiri shawl. - Yes. Why did you need to buy such a expensive guest? Who says that it is very expensive, sir? It is just worth some three thousand rupees. A couple of thousands? Okay. Sit down. You.. come here. What do you do? I am in building constructions. Ok. So how much do you earn? I dint have any fixed incomes. Some times, I get fifteen to sixteen lakhs.. And sometimes, I don't even get six to seven lakhs. Is it? Rama.. Rama.. What do you do with so much money? Where do I have any money? See.. I pay so many taxes. I pay Income tax, Professional tax.. Entertainment tax.. then health tax occupational tax.. Road tax.. motor tax this tax.. That tax.. I give all kinds of tax. Rama.. he is Inder. He is a old student. He has become a big builder contractor nowadays. And this is Rama.. Sir, I had a exciting introduction with them yesterday. They were standing in the scorching sun. I recognized them. I told them that I will give them a lift, But I was scolded! I just ran away from there! See, Prakash.. it is so funny. It is Rama's birthday today, and I am getting the gift. Today.. it is Rama's birthday? Yes. And see.. Have your dinner here tonight, okay? That is all right, sir. But I will ask to go now. Okay, but come at night, I have lots of things to discuss. Sure. Okay, Prakash. He has started chasing us. - I am sure that there is something amiss. - Oh! Didn't you hear that? He was father's student. All this is just a farce. He has fallen in love with you. Why? Even you were with me that day. Rama.. the one who was to fall in love with me.. He has fallen in love with me a long time ago. Please come. See, there should be decoration from here till there. There should be some chairs. And lights and all. This work should be done till five. And see, there should be a tent here. - Show us such magic, the people who see it, should be stunned. - Yes, sir. What is all this? I was just passing along, and I met this contractor. Ever since I have come, he's telling me to give him a chance to serve. I thought that I will give him a chance to serve. Even the people should see and say.. Yes.. this is some party. It has been given for people close to me. And I don't need a tent for them. This is the limit. That means that.. You won't let me happy on your birthday? What is the need of a tent to be happy? I don't like the showing off of wealth. You have a very nice smile, Mr. Prakash. I am really very sorry, Miss Rama. But everyone gets happy in their own way. I didn't have any other objective. Come, Mr. Khan. Don't forget to come to the party. May you be safe for a thousand years. Okay, you bless me first. Kabir didn't come, Laila? He doesn't reach anywhere on time.. Except the patient's house. He must be coming. - Congratulations on your birthday. - Thank you. - Please have a seat. - You go, I will arrange everything. Does anyone eat betel leaves here? Uncle, you will have it, isn't it? Yes. Here. Zarda? Bless you. Greetings, Miss. Rama. Greetings. Many many happy returns of the day. It is so beautiful. It is real, isn't it? I don't believe in fakes. - Did you like my taste? - Yes. Very good. Then my hard work is rewarded. I will sign on a paper and come in half an hour. - Listen.. - Yes. Please take this back. Why? I don't like jewellery at all. It will remain.. In the house without any reason. A flower or some book is enough for me. - Greetings, Miss Rama. - Greetings. With best compliments. What is it? A book of poems. Very good. Please come. Come back after half an hour, okay? I will come, surely.. son. Rama.. Rama.. Yes, father? Okay.. it is eleven? Yes. You were born on exactly eleven, isn't it? Therefore, I come to bless you exactly.. On eleven on your birthday. Okay, father.. are you not sad? If only you had a son in lieu of a daughter? Not at all. Sita.. Savitri.. Saraswati all were daughters. I bless you.. child.. You shouldn't do any such thing in life.. Due to which, anyone be sad in life. What are you writing? Oh.. you? Sit down. Are you making a budget? Budget? What else? You must have thought that I lost the bet today. This means that you will get a rupee. And you are making a budget to spend it. Inder, you too. I won this bet the day it was laid. No, friend. This is what I came to tell you. I have never lost a bet, and neither will I ever. Prakash.. Money can change status. What has happened to you? What are you blabbering? It is a matter of respect now. Good night. Doctor.. Doctor.. Greetings. Greetings. Is the doctor at home? No. he has gone out right now. Just like that. I had a burn in my chest. Will I get a glass of water, please? Yes. Of course. Come inside. Karim.. please bring a glass of water. Please come. Have a seat. I have heard.. you bought a necklace for Rama yesterday? Then you must have heard that she almost threw it at my face. Okay, you are her friend, you know her very well. Can you tell me what is she more interested in? Yes. Poems. Does Rama recite poetry? - Do you know Hindi? - Yes. I didn't know therefore, I used it as a fan. One of her poems has been published. Look at page number 16. She likes poetry. But there isn't anyone to read or praise it. She showed it once to uncle, and he took out.. Three to four thousand mistakes in it. I have read such a beautiful couplet after many days. She has a style. But.. Laila sister.. A new poet doesn't have such style.. Why do you think that she is a new poet? She has written hundred of poems. But all of them are in a coffin called books. Sister.. I can call you sister, isn't it? Yes. Why not? I want to read all her poems. Will you.. Please bring that notebook to me? But.. please.. Rama shouldn't know about it. It's possible that she will be angry if she finds out. But why did you give him my book without asking me? So what if I gave it to him? You are strange. Mr. Greetings and uncle doesn't notice your poetry.. And this poor man likes your poetry.. - And even then, you are angry. - Even then! Even then, what? That man will not print your poems in his name, I want to have these poems printed. Is it? You started poetry too? Forget it. Poetry is not my level. See, I want this book in four days. In four days? There will be composing.. and printing.. You don't tell me all these reasons. Keep this blank cheque. Give your whole staff four times overtime. But friend.. The book should be printed in such a way.. That no other book should have been printed like this. And yes.. print a introduction for me too. If you don't have time, give some.. One else a couple of hundred and do it. Hey, listen.. What? How many copies do you want? One.. One will do. Greetings. Greetings. Why did you take my poem book like this? That is what I have come to return. I couldn't stop myself, when I read.. One of your poems at sister Laila's house. Therefore, forgive me. Greetings.. Your voice is like your poems. Very beautiful. Why did you run away after giving me the book that day? Because I knew that you'd feel.. Very angry when you'd come to know.. That I printed your book without asking you. - Fearing that.. - Oh, so you can fear too? Yes. From artistes like you. You are not common people.. What was the need of printing my normal poetries like this? Normal poems? Miss Rama, you don't know your self. I am not a artiste, but I know a bit of art. Your poems are not common. They are sparks. You will see. They will set fire to the world of literature one day. You are mad. If I am mad.. Then many other people are mad too. Look at this small proof. What is this? This is the royalty of how many ever copies which have been sold.. Within seven days of your book of poems. This cheque was to come through post. I was passing by.. So I felt that I should do the good deed.. Of reaching this to you. You must have read what great.. Writers have written about your book. No. Hey.. The publishers said that they sent you the reviews. Tell me. What is written? First you tell me. Are you happy with this crazy idea? Silence is the first work of Rama Sharma. But I felt that I don't know since.. How many years she is filling.. Up her thoughts with the seven colors of her creativity. What are you doing tomorrow evening? Why? I donated a bit more in the music.. Competition that is going on in Nandgaon. They have made me a president. If you come with me, my dignity will be saved. How is that? See, I don't know anything about music. I will praise wherever I see you praise anything. Who is coming? I don't know.. some Ravi Shankar. Will Pandit Ravi Shankar be coming? Yes.. he is the one.. Then I will surely come. But you please ask sir about it. Yes, I will. Okay, I will come to pick you up at four in the evening tomorrow. Why did you stop the car? I lied to you. What do you mean? This is not the way to the music competition. Miss Rama.. Please listen to me.. Please.. I am stunned looking at your guts. Even I am stunned, Miss Rama. I couldn't even think that I would do such a thing a few days ago. I.. I will not apologize to you, but I.. Will just request you to listen to the reason of this show of guts. Yes.. I lied to you. But just so that I could stay with you. Yes. I am ready to be punished for this crime. But please don't punish me for the crime I didn't commit. You have seen a lot of madness I did. But you never saw any vulgarity on my side. If I had any sin in my mind.. Would I be standing in your presence like this? If I have loved you then for just the reason.. That you make me pure. I am telling the truth. I know, I am not a such good person. You have such culture and dignity.. I can understand that nicely. Because, in you.. I can see the person.. Who wants to become good. Miss. Rama, I am going away from here in a couple of days. Where? Muscat. I won't be back for six to seven years. Miss Rama, therefore.. I thought that I would spend an evening with you.. And listen to your songs, and spend.. All those years in the memory of that evening. Come on.. I drop you home. It is fixed today that I am not worthy.. To spend an evening with any honest girl. We will wait for a while and go. The swings of the monsoon have arrived. The swings of the monsoon have arrived. You please come.. You please come.. You please come.. You please come.. It doesn't leave me.. This breeze has gone crazy. It doesn't leave me.. This breeze has gone crazy.. What should I do now? My heart beats like a flying bird. The swings of the monsoon have arrived. You please come.. You please come.. The heart has called out to you.. From the countries of memories. The heart has called out to you. From the countries of memories. From the country that it comes.. We are standing in it, since such a long time.. The swings of monsoon have arrived. You please come.. You please come.. You please come.. You please come.. Where are you nowadays? You aren't to be seen? I was a little busy. Shoot the work. What is the work.. Today is the fifteenth, you see? I am not a businessman. I am a student of literature. I don't keep the account of the days. Yes, so I will tell you. Come to my house at around four.. Or four thirty, with one new rupee. I will meet you there. Mr. Inder has sent this letter for you. Mr. Rama, you have promised.. That you will have the evening tea with me. I just thought that I would remind you. And yes, I am going from here tomorrow. Sir has asked for an answer. Tell him that I will come. Greetings. Rama.. Oh.. Rama.. What is it, father? Prakash has come since so long.. He didn't get any tea or anything. Oh yes, I forgot all about it. Laccho is on holiday today too. I will arrange for it right away. Please come. And yes, listen.. child.. Prakash was saying that Inder isn't like us. It isn't good to meet him and all. And to tell you the truth.. This is what I think too. Father.. Yes? Laila is going.. Shall I go to the station to drop her? Yes.. yes.. of course, go.. child. Greetings, sir? Prakash.. Come.. come.. I was waiting for you. I remembered a very good episode today. Come on, we will start the work, come. Please come.. come.. I have won a bet today. My heart bet that you will not come. I still can't believe that you have come. It seems like a dream. Please have a seat. This is great. You have started seeing the watch now? There are so many better things to watch. Like this cake, this pastry.. What is the matter? You seem worried. Actually, I told father something else and came here. Why did you have to lie? You don't know father, isn't it? And then.. I had promised that I would come here. That means.. That means.. You lied for me and came here? Come on.. I found out.. That there is place for lies in this world too. I had become bricks and mortar.. As I worked between bricks and mortar. But that evening, when there wasn't.. Anything between us except the.. Silence of the evening, I felt as if.. As if.. Moving the bags of cement and the piles of mortar.. That man is trying to come out.. The man who I used to be at some time. Will you please sing that song for me once again? Sir, I didn't get the tea till now today. Yes. And you won't get it too. Laccho is on a holiday. And Rama has gone to drop Laila to the station a while back. - Laila? - Yes. She went by the twelve o' clock train. I had gone to the station to buy a parcel of books, there, I met Laila.. Then Rama.. No.. This cannot be possible that Rama.. Doesn't know which train Laila is going on.. Then did Rama lie to me and go somewhere else? Yesterday.. yesterday night.. I had a bit more.. See.. You seem different. You are really someone else. - Sir.. I will have to go. - Where? How can I tell you now, sir? What is the matter, Prakash? Sir.. I. Rama.. - Let me go, sir. - Prakash.. Prakash. You know where Rama has gone. Sir, please let me go. I ask you.. Where has Rama gone? Listen.. Who is inside? I don't know. But it is not allowed to go inside. Does this mean that Dolly is sent on a holiday? - Inder.. - Madam.. - You keep quiet. - Inder.. What are you doing here? I was calling you. You go away from here. Come here. Why did you come here when I didn't call you? You didn't call me since many days. Therefore, I came here. Don't talk rubbish. Go away from here. Come on! Go! Understood. The start of a new story.. And the end of an old story. Wait. Let me count. Rukhiya.. Suzy.. Kamla.. and me. Who is she? Will you go away from here or not? Where have we come, Prakash? Sir.. sir.. you here? - Oh.. Inder? - Yes. - Is this your house? - Yes, please come. - It is very fortunate that.. - So, has Rama come here? So the singer's name is Rama? Yes. She has come here. She is in the room inside. Rama.. Sir.. I didn't come to meet you, Rama. Rama.. So this is the station.. You had to lie to come here. This is too much, old boy. When a girl romances secretly.. - Will she not lie to her father? - Shut up! Why are you telling me to shut up? Am I some window or door that I will shut up? Come on.. out.. out.. Okay. I understand everything. Rama has come in my place. You don't need me. Give me my money. Prakash.. you knew everything.. And even then you kept silent? If you would tell me.. Then a father would be saved from.. Seeing his daughter in the garb.. Of a loose woman of a rich wastrel. And you fell so low? Father.. I didn't do anything that.. You didn't do anything? What else did you wish to do? - What else did you wish to do? - Sir., sir.. Mr. Prakash. Thanks for bringing father here. Insolent.. You aren't seeing your antics and you are blaming Prakash? Prakash.. Take me away from this hell. Take me away. Inder.. You gave me my reward for teaching you. Come on, Prakash. Miss Rama.. Why are you worried? I was worth this. Thanks for the tea. See, Miss Rama, how am I at fault in this? - You.. - Listen.. I am Rama, I am not Dolly or Suzy. I told you a thousand times that excitement.. Isn't good for you. If you don't listen to me.. You will become blind one day. What should a honest man done.. After seeing his daughter come.. Out from the bedroom of a wastrel? I don't understand. Where did I err in bringing her up? You say that I will lose my eyesight. If the daughter goes, what is there in the eyes? It would have been better if she didn't take birth. But if she would take birth, it would.. Have been better if she died before this day. Congratulations. You won the bet. Here is your rupee. Forget it. Whatever happened today.. for that.. Why did you bring sir there? Why do you ask all these things? You did win the bet, isn't it? Can I drop Miss Rama to her house? What? She left from here at that moment itself. Did she not come home? No. Where else did she go then? Come.. come. See, the train has come.. - Oh, Lalaji.. - Oh, Nandlalji.. - Where are you going? I am not going. My wife's brother is going. - Greetings, brother-in-law. - Greetings. Show me the ticket. No, this will not do. - Why? - This will have to be weighed on a machine.. And arranged in the brake van. It will take almost two or two and.. - Half tickets in the sitting car. - What do you mean? You are Lalaii's brother-in -law.. Then even we have some right on you as the villagers. Come.. come.. Lalaii.. Please show me your ticket. He has just come to drop me. Yes, so show me just the platform ticket. Give me fifty paisa. It is a government platform. And take the ticket while you go. Thank you.. thank you.. - Manglu! - Yes, sir? - Take the parcel down quickly. - Yes, sir. Quickly. - Hey, do you have the ticket or not? - I took it! Sister, till when does the train stop here? Just a couple of minutes, why? I am very thirsty. I wish to drink water. Yes, go. The water is here. Freshen up too. You sit in the next car, I will come right away. Hey.. That woman.. where did she go? My bag.. Your sister went down with you. Where did she go? - Listen.. - Just a minute, where is the ticket? I don't have the ticket. You don't have the ticket, then sit down there. They just come, conmen! - Yes, give me the ticket. - Here you are. Yes? Did you see some woman go from here? Wearing a white and black saree like this one? She had some warts on her face. Where do I have the time to watch sarees and faces? My life has passed catching these WTs. Did no girl go from here? A girl.. I did see one. - Can I see? - Yes. See. - You have a ticket? - Yes. Hey. Where is the ticket? Where are you going? What is this? This is a railway station. Sit down here silently. They come to roam around for free. - Oh.. oh.. where are you going? - Let me go.. the train.. Will you board the running train? What is the matter? See.. I was going by this train. I got down to drink water. And she took my bag and escaped. You left your bag and went to drink water? This is great. It seems that you.. Are living even today in the age of truth. Come on. Come with me. Manglu.. give them a receipt, they are WT Come with me. Come on. Sons.. were you itching once again? Come.. sit down. Sit down. So the rest of your luggage must be in the train too? I will give the message to the next station right now. I didn't have any other luggage. No luggage? - Then. Were you traveling with a single bag? - Yes. Okay. Then write a report. I don't want to report it. See. I don't have anything except this. Take this, and give me a ticket to Delhi. Wait. Where will this be sold in such a small village? And let us think that your ticket is arranged for too. You will get the next train tomorrow morning now. And there isn't no other train other than the morning one. Then, where will you stay all night? In the waiting room. Nobody waits on the station, where will there be a waiting room? Then? I have an idea. My quarters are nearby. You can stay there. No. why should I trouble you? Where does the question of trouble arise here? I stay all alone there. What happened? Understood. You think that I will eat you up. Do I seem to be a vagrant to you? Stay here. Your train was robbed in a packed train. You will disappear in an empty station. Okay. Okay. This is bad in girls. They agree quickly to what shouldn't be agreed to. And they will never agree to what should be. You agreed to what she said who took your bag away. And you don't listen to what I say who is giving you shelter. A woman has a form of sister and daughter too. And a man is not just a hoodlum. He can be a brother too. Okay. Here. Here. Keep it. This is enough to save yourself from me. Keep it. You are thinking.. Manglu.. shut the office down. Come on.. come on.. come on.. Come.. come.. Come.. come.. The place is small. I hope that you will like it. Come.. Come. This is my quarter. Just a minute, I will come right away. She is my sister Sudha. I saw you there, I remembered her. Therefore, I brought you here. What happened to her? We didn't know. She expired after a half an hour.. Illness just two months before marriage. This is bad in me. I should just get a chance. I sit with the sad story of Sudha. Freshen up, I am starving! Come.. Come.. This.. straight ahead. Please be quick. I am hungry. When the time comes, I can give my life for someone. But I cannot stay hungry. But listen.. I will have to eat less today. I didn't know that you will be coming. You have your food. I won't eat. You are going by tomorrow evening's train to Delhi, isn't it? Then please become my Sudha for me till tomorrow evening. Come.. Whatever is there.. We brother and sister will eat it together. - Master.. master.. - Manglu. What is the matter? Sir.. it is a problem. 85 down has met with an accident. What? Yes, sir. Five miles from here. We got a call, the trolley is coming. Okay, you leave. I will reach there. Oh.. Did you see that? God is great. The train in which you were traveling that has met with an accident. Maybe I will come till tomorrow morning. You don't worry. Eat the food and sleep. Come..Close the door first. Come on, close the door. Oh God! If this was to happen.. Why did I get down? Why did I get down from the train? Mr. Inder. You? Where did you go? Answer me, first. How did I hurt you, that you did this farce with me? Miss Rama.. I.. Mr. Inder. I had a small life in a small village. Without any dreams. You came then.. And showed me new dreams. I believed in you. And then.. Slowly.. I became close to you. Was this my mistake? That you did the same things with me.. Which you did with girls like Dolly? Miss. Rama, I tell you the truth. All this started with a drama but.. But the drama wasn't a drama after you left. It had become truth after you left. Do you know on which road you thrust me? I cannot become Dolly or Priya. There is just one way out for me. Suicide. - Nandlal.. - Nandlal is dead. Oh, Inspector.. please come. I got some rest now. Have a seat. Will you have some tea? Not tea. Just give me one glass of cold water. Sudha, bring some sherbet for the inspector. So, how many died altogether? - Twenty four in all. - Twenty four? Did you send a letter to everyone's home? The ones whom I got the addresses too. I sent the letters to their houses. But some bodies have been trampled so badly.. It is difficult to recognize them. One dead body had an infant child in her hands. The name was Rameshwari Devi. Who she was and from where she was.. Below the other body, there were some court documents. He must be going to Aligarh, for a court date. Therefore, we found out about him. Then, we found a bag near a trampled dead body There was a letter in that bag. Rama Sharma. It was addressed to care of professor Daya Shankar.. Court road, Pratapgadh.. Daya Shankar, a letter for you. You read it for me. Whose letter is it? It is about Rama? What is it? Has she married Inder? No. Then? Prakash, read it for him. What happened? What is it, Prakash? Give it to me, Prakash. Give it to me. Hey.. Hey.. all this.. All this is getting black.. Kabir.. Kabir.. Everything is drowning in darkness. Kabir.. Kabir.. I am blind.. I am totally blind, Kabir.. - Greetings, uncle. - Greetings. Listen.. I got the news that some.. - Girl is staying with Nandlal? - Yes. Have you seen her? Who is she? We don't know that. What must be her age? How is she to look at? She must be twenty five or twenty six. She seems good to look at. I will ruin him going there. Sudha.. oh Sudha.. What is it, brother? Take my clothes out. I will have a bath till then. Okay. You don't bathe, brother. You just hold a drama of bathing. The one who has his mind and soul pure.. Doesn't need a whole river to bathe. He just needs a pot. If the mind and soul is pure.. Is it necessary to wear this torn tunic too? See.. If you don't buy a tunic for yourself today.. Then I will go away by the train today evening. No. I will buy a tunic for myself today. Sure promise. You have given this surety yesterday too. No, that was a bit raw. Okay. Who is it? Who is it? Uncle.. you? Greetings.. uncle.. Come.. come.. come.. He is my uncle.. Pandit Prabhakar Chaturvedi. The teacher of music. What is your name? - Sudha Sharma. - Silent. Did I ask you? What is your name? Sudha Sharma. - Are you a Brahmin? - Yes. - Caste? - Uncle.. What are you doing? I told you.. That she is our Sudha and you.. Started asking her sub caste? Oh God.. what a time this is.. People have forgot a woman's form of daughter and sister completely. What are you standing for? Take his blessings. Take uncle's blessings. Move ahead. Uncle.. Laila.. when did you come? Right now. You will stay for some days, isn't it? I can could, I wouldn't go all my life. There should be someone with you. There is Lachya. She prepares food twice. Sir.. I will live here now. No need of it. You are like my father, sir. If I don't look after you.. and then.. I don't have any other relations. Please agree, uncle. If Prakash stays with you.. Even I will get assurance there that you are not alone. Brother.. You? There is a great problem, brother. Problem? What do you mean? Uncle.. was questioning me. I cannot tell lies and.. This is bad in the old age. When there isn't anything Left in their life.. They start scraping the tops of other's lives. You don't worry. Sit in the office. I will come right away. Everything will be all right. Hey.. ticket.. Manglu.. let the train go. Are you the station master here? Your introduction? Inder Saxena. I have come to find something about that accident. Oh.. come.. come in my office. Are you related to the Life Insurance? No. Sit. Then you must be a journalist in some newspaper. I came to find out about the girl who was in that same train. Has she not reached home till now? She hasn't reached home till now.. But a letter about her has reached home. I am talking about Rama Sharma. Did you recognize her dead body? The dead bodies weren't possible to be recognized. We got the bag.. therefore.. How does finding the bag prove that the girl was Rama Sharma? That bag didn't buy a ticket to Delhi.. And wasn't going to Delhi all by itself? And it isn't possible that it stole Ramadevi's hand too? Don't try to be funny. Have you ever thought what can.. Be the effect of that letter on someone? The police had sent the letter. Why are you scolding me? The spot where the accident took place how far is it from here? It is some five miles. Does the car go till there? - Yes. - Thank you. Oh God! This was a storm. Sudha.. Sudha.. Yes, brother? Why are you standing here? What is the matter? Nothing, brother.. Rama! Who was that man? Neighbor. Who is there in the house? Only father. - I will send him a letter right now. - No.. brother.. It is better if I am dead for him. What is the matter, Rama? What is the matter? This is my story. Now you tell me.. How can I face my father in these circumstances? How is he? In which state is he? If only I can find out that he has forgiven me.. I will just go to my house then.. He.. He cannot live with out me. - He cannot live without me. - Okay, don't cry. I will take a holiday and go to see him for you. Okay? You believe in my eyes, isn't it? I will make uncle understand. You go to Bombay with him, okay? Prakash.. I am coming from there. From where? The spot where Miss Rama met with an accident, Why did you go there? To ask forgiveness from Rama's soul? No. I am not ready to believe that Rama is dead. What does it matter whether you accept it or not? What was Miss Rama for you? She was just one trophy out of many? - She was just a one rupee note? - I.. I will not feel bad about anything that you say, Prakash. You always thought that I had my heart in my pocket? Even I used to think that. But.. But now I have come to know.. My heart is in my breast. Rama was born.. My family members were very sad. Uncle.. take this tea. When did you come? Where did Laccho go? She has gone home, uncle. And for me? How could I bring three cups in two hands? There isn't any saccharine now. You will get just half a cup, that's it. Greetings. Is this the bungalow of Professor Daya Shankar? Yes. I have come from afar. My name is Nandlal. Nandlal Chaturvedi.. Can I meet the professor? - Please come in. - Thank you. Sir. This is Nandlal Chaturvedi. He has come to meet you. Greetings. Bless you, son. Bless you. Have a seat. Your eyes.. I have become blind. Tell me. What can I do for you? That is enough, Mr. Sharma. You let me take blessings, that is enough. But I have a bad habit of drinking tea. I have to do the duty late in the night, isn't it? Laila.. Wow.. You understood that I asked for tea.. As soon as you heard the voice? You are great too, Miss Rama. My name is Laila. But who told you that my daughter's name is Rama? First of all, I beg forgiveness from all of you. But I couldn't think of any other way to talk about Miss Rama. The matter is.. I am the station master of the station.. Which is just a few kilometers away from the accident spot. I had sent you the letter. Anyway.. that was my duty. But.. we didn't get Miss Rama's dead body. Only a hand bag was found. Therefore, even after I sent a letter.. I used to hope that maybe, she was alive? You took trouble without any reason. She had died before the accident for me. Uncle.. uncle.. Brother.. What is this? Were you banging your head and crying? - Come on.. - What is the matter? Brother.. How is father? He is all right. He is well. Not like this, tell me from the beginning. You must have gone there and pressed the bell. Then someone must have opened the door. Then you went inside.. The sofa set. It must be there. In the middle of the room. Father must be sitting there in a shawl.. sad.. Yes.. In the middle of the room. He was sitting there in a shawl. But he wasn't sad. No. He wasn't sad at all. And a fat girl.. with betel leaves in her mouth.. She was blabbering and blabbering. What was her name? I forgot.. Yes.. Laila.. Her father was fatter than her. As soon as the fatso turned to talk to her father.. She spat all over her saree, and looking at it.. Your father was laughing so loud.. He was laughing so sad. I can't tell you. I can't tell you. - What happened after that? - What was to happen after that? Father made me sit next to him. Laila offered me some teas. And we talked about sundry for some while. They didn't talk about me? How could they speak in front of an unknown person about you? But you don't worry. He is all right and happy. Yes. Child.. Uncle.. - Will you teach me music? - Yes, yes. I want to forget everything. I want to forget everything, uncle.. Oh.. beloved.. Radhike.. Crazy, girl.. Have become.. I have become crazy.. Searching for Shyama.. She herself has forgotten herself.. The beloved Radhika has become crazy.. She calls out the name in every path of Gokul.. She is sitting on the banks of Jamuna.. She calls out the name in every path of Gokul.. She is sitting on the banks of Jamuna.. Sometimes.. you and sometimes mine.. She went to our house.. Searching for Shyama.. She herself has forgotten herself.. The beloved Radhika has become crazy.. If she meets Mohan somewhere.. The flute sang.. and the heart called up.. If she meets Mohan somewhere.. The flute sang.. and the heart called up.. She was so lost in the flute. Searching for Shyama.. She was lost herself.. The beloved Radhika has become crazy.. The beloved Radhika has become crazy.. Daya Shankar's condition is bad. And if he isn't taken away from here his state will only worsen. He just has one cure. To forget Rama. But he cannot forget Rama in this house. Prakash, arrange to take him somewhere out. Prakash.. Twenty or thirty miles away from Bombay.. One of my house is empty. We will take sir there. Should I take him to your house? This isn't possible. Why is it not possible? Even you had placed the bet with me. And you didn't even have any reason to place the bet. At least. I have a reason to place the bet. Reason? What was the reason? Prakash.. When we studied in college together.. I was also decent like you. But I was poor. After my father's death, my uncle had me engaged. But the girl ran away with a boy before marriage. Do you know why? Because money could give her all.. The comforts, that I couldn't give. The people made fun of me and pointed fingers at me. I decided on that day that money is everything in life. I started working had from that day.. And made all this wealth. And I started returning the joke to the people with interest. That bride had prepared a picture.. Of women in my mind, I saw that picture in every woman I met. But.. After Ms. Rama, when the photo was blurred.. Prakash.. When I used to act as if I was in love with Ms. Rama.. I used to be surprised how I could act so well. But slowly I found out.. I wasn't acting. This became the truth of my life. Yes, Prakash. I.. Rama.. I can't do anything at this time. I cannot see sir in this state. Take him to my house immediately. But.. he will not accept living in your house. Why not? What is the need of telling him that the house is mine? What will I tell him? If you want, tell him that the house belongs to a friend. Or tell him that the house belongs to a enemy. And if you cannot tell this.. Say that you had placed a bet on Rama with me. Prakash.. I don't want to blackmail you telling this. Even you.. Serving him as you wish to repent. I cannot get a right to be that repentant. What are you doing? Come to your senses, stand straight. Where is it? Here it is. It will be fun. A bit more. It is fun. Baburam.. Baburam.. Yes, sir? Did you take all the photos and everything else from here? How will I take out everything else? You speak a lot. If in this warble, you tell them.. One day that this is my house.. How will I say that? It isn't my house. - It seems that they have arrived. - I will see right away.. Greetings, sir. Greetings.. Please come.. Give it to me.. Come.. come.. Come.. Careful.. Come.. Please come.. Here.. here.. A bit more.. Here.. sit.. sit.. I have arranged upstairs for you. Please rest here for now. Shall I bring tea for you? Tell me your name first. My name.. my man Baburam. Baburam. It is a good name. What happened? You said that is a good name? Even my wife says the same. Okay. Baburam.. You won't have a problem if I stay here? No, sir. You shouldn't have any problems. - Np. - Sir had told me a thousand times. You should have all the rest. He has told me today in the morning too. - Morning? - Yes. Then please have me meet him once. Meet him.. I mean... He isn't here.. you see.. We talked over the telephone. Okay. What is his name? Name? I call him as sir, and my employer called him Munna. Oh.. uncle.. uncle.. We call him with every name. Actually, big men have many names. Lord Krishna.. He had so many names.. Do you know many that is? - How much? - 108.. - Correct! I will get tea for you. Sir, will you go upstairs and rest? No. I will first have tea which Baburam has prepared. He is a very interesting person. He made me smile! Sir.. I will come in two minutes. Yes. Go.. go.. Prakash. I am going to Bombay. I have sent a car for Dr. Shingel. If you need anything, just tell me. And yes.. I am taking this car. The car in which Dr. Shingel is coming, will be for you. Okay. Sir.. sir.. your letter.. - Listen.. - Yes. - Is there any phone here nearby? - It is upstairs. Okay. Call Inder from any neighbor's place. Inder? Who is Inder, sir? I don't know any Inder. The name of your employer is Inder, isn't it? No.. what are you saying? My employer is the almighty. - Okay, who owns this house? - The employer's. - Who is the employer? - The almighty. See. If you don't call Inder straightway.. I will tell Inder that you told me that he owns the house. Sir, will you lie even though you are a gentleman? Yes. Tell me. What is to be said? Tell him that Laila will be coming here in a couple of days. Laila.. Sir.. listen.. Can I ask you something? Will Laila come alone, or will Majnu will come with her too? No, let her come. Oh! Have you come, daughter? Yes. I have come. Did your husband not come with you? He will come after eight days or so.. There is a dental conference there. Even I told him. You remove and set the teeth. I am going to my uncle. I will just send the letter of Laila reaching. Yes. Go. Go. It's good uncle. That you left the house for some days. Yes. I didn't feel right there. When a man becomes blind.. He can see the earlier days very well. May God keep Prakash happy! Prakash.. Come.. come. It is good that you came for a few days. Laila.. I can serve sir, but I cannot keep him happy. It seems that nobody can make him happy now. There is a amount of life needed by a person to forget Rama.. And I doubt that he has that much life left. I don't worry about him. I worry about you. Why? What has happened to me? See.. you cannot cry better than me! At this time, I am not Rama's friend.. But I ask you as your sister. Is this the objective of life? A person should burn like a incense stick in someone else's house... And then finish off? May God deal with that Inder.. Who finished off three lives in one stroke. It is good that you spoke about Inder yourself. I wanted to tell you something about Inder since a number of days. But I couldn't bring myself to say it. This house belongs to Inder. What? But uncle was saying that this house belongs to some friend of yours? Then who told you that Inder is my enemy? Inder is just his own enemy. If you ask me.. Everyone is at fault in this story. Me too. You? Yes. And all are repenting in some form. Sir according to him. Me in my way. And Inder in his own way. But does uncle know that this house belongs to Inder? No. and he shouldn't know it too. Uncle Kabir told me to take sir away from that house. The cure is very expensive. You know my financial condition. And Inder wanted to repent. Hi! Did you come here, thinking that it is some other house.. Or did you come here? I came here. Good. But I don't have money nowadays. Therefore, I can just serve you some rum. I have left alcohol. What? What did you do? It's good news. I will make a call and come. I had called a friend. I didn't know if you'd come. Dolly. Stop calling your friends. There isn't any left in that. What will we eat then? You must have thought something about yourself? What do I have to think about? I have read my tomorrow and day.. After tomorrow's news in the newspaper today. I am just a bad penny. I will work till I will. Dolly.. this is what I came to tell you. Start life in a new way. Think about what you wish to do. Twenty.. twenty five thousand, What ever you need? I will give it to you. Twenty -twenty five thousand? Life has become too expensive, Inder.. Maybe I can just look at life in that amount. From a far. Well, it doesn't matter. Only a look, if that's it. Give me the money. I have to pay the rent for three months too. I will arrange something to eat for you. The swings of monsoon are ready.. The swings of monsoon are ready.. You.. please come.. You.. please come.. You.. please come.. You.. please come.. It doesn't leave me.. The breeze has gone mad.. It doesn't leave me.. The breeze has gone mad.. What should I do? My heart beats like a flying bird. The swings of monsoon are ready. You.. please come.. Please come.. When we had met, beloved. You were so immature. When we had met, beloved. You were so immature.. We didn't know all this.. We saw you in my young age.. The swings of the monsoon are ready. You.. please come.. You.. please come.. You.. please come.. Sister has come.. sister has come.. You people stay silent. Let me speak first.. You created magic. There is such pain in sister's voice, isn't it? Yes. Uncle, listen to her. It is my throat, and she understands the pain. I am not joking. I haven't seen such pain in anyone's voice. - Listen.. - What, brother? Before you sleep, apply some Throat Pain or something. Why? The pain will decrease automatically. What are you laughing about? Come on. Learn singing. Come on. - Kamal.. - Yes, sister? One man is coming to meet me. If he asks for Sudha Sharma say that you are Sudha Sharma. If he asks for anyone else, say that she doesn't stay here. But sister.. Don't argue and go fast. I don't want to meet him. Why are you so worried? Who has come? - Is Ms. Sudha here? - Why? - I want to meet her. - Why? I will tell her. Then tell me. I am Sudha Sharma. Are you are Sudha Sharma? Yes. Why? Do you object? No, I don't object. But I am shocked. You sing like a cuckoo.. But while speaking.. Please don't waste my time. Okay. He didn't agree that I was Sudha Sharma. - But who was he? - Who was he? - Nobody.. - Greetings.. Please listen to me.. I don't want to listen to you. But.. Brother.. If he goes, close the door. And tell him.. never to come here. See.. you.. - I just want to tell her one thing. - You tell it to her some time else. You go away from here at this time. Please. Hello? Hello? Who called up, sir? I don't know.. it was cut. But Prakash. I felt that there was someone on the other side. He didn't speak. Why will someone not speak if they telephone? Nowadays, the telephone lines are awry. Listen.. Call the big house. Call Mr. Prakash. And tell him that Dr. Shingel wishes to speak to him. Okay. - Sir.. - Yes? Hello? Is Mr. Prakash at home? Dr. Shingel wishes to speak to you. Prakash, I am Inder. See, I know that sir is near you. Therefore, listen carefully to whatever I am about to say. Please say. Prakash. Rama is alive. But see. Sir shouldn't know about it. Prakash.. Come here. She didn't meet me. Maybe, she will meet you. Okay. I will come right away. Whose call was it, Prakash? It was the doctor. What did the doctor say, that you are so scared? I wasn't scared.. He said that he has found a new cure for you. He was very excited. He has called me immediately. Sir. Laila is here. If you permit shall I go and meet him? Yes, go. But tell him, not to be worried for me. Yes, sir. What happened? Is uncle all right? Yes. - Then, what is the matter? - Rama is alive. Yes, Inder has found her out. Did you tell it to uncle? No. The doctor has told us to keep him away from every good or bad news. Did Inder look at Rama himself? Yes, but she didn't meet him. I will see.. Whether she meets me or refuses to meet me too. Laila.. I am going there. - You take care of sir till then. - Yes, surely. Uncle.. Hey.. What happened, child? Why are you crying? I miss Rama a lot today. Why don't you forget her? Go.. don't fake around with me. As if I don't know what is going on in your heart. Because she lied once. And what.. You threw her out of the house.. About the lies that you say to yourself? You? Why did you come here? - I came to see whether.. - Hey.. Since when have you started seeing? Ever since people learnt to set fake rumors of their death. The real matter is.. That you have learnt to see. What have you seen? I have seen that people haven't just changed their names... but have changed themselves too. - Rama. - My name is Sudha Sharma. What else have you seen? And I have seen with your new name... With new life you are happy. You have always had a problem with me being happy. I don't want to justify myself. Justifying myself to Sudha Sharma is useless. But I could never even think.. That you would change so much. I revered you like a goddess. But you weren't a goddess, you were a goddess statue. Who cannot see or feel anything. The ones who weren't statues.. What did they see? What did they feel? I have heard that all are very happy and laughing. When nobody is sad about my death.. Then what is the fun in dying? Therefore, I am living. Don't tell father that I am alive. He will be very sad if he knows it. Who father? I don't know Sudha Sharma's father, Ms. Rama. Didn't I tell you? Yes. I know that you are Sudha Sharma. But it is your thought that you are alive. You died right now, insulting your father's sadness. Oh.. you? Greetings.. How is the professor now? He is laughing harder than when you had seen. Mr. Prakash.. don't be so angry. Rama was like that at the time.. I couldn't tell her the truth. The truth. What do you mean? You don't have a right or need to ask the meaning now. Did Rama come? No. she is coming with Prakash. Did Prakash tell her everything? Yes, I told the car to come from behind. Remember, That uncle shouldn't know all of a sudden that Rama is alive. Any kind of excitement will be a risk for his life. Ms. Rama is coming. Please take care of her. Yes. Rama.. Baburam.. Open the room downstairs for Panditji.. Thank god.. Come on.. Who is it? It is me. I heard the car's noise, has Prakash come? Yes, sir. Prakash, what did your doctor say? - Sir. - Yes? That doctor.. Why are you so hiding? Prakash, I don't wish to see this world any longer now. How will the doctor know what the incurable wound of my heart is? The same thing, later. Uncle. If you speak about my friend like this.. Then I will go away from here. You had spoken about her today, child. I wish that she shouldn't come in my dreams too. But does this happen? Sometimes I think.. She has come to me. And she says.. What does she say, uncle? No, child. It is better if she doesn't come. She has given me so much pain.. I can never forgive her. See, Prakash. Laila is angry and went away. She doesn't understand that.. Listen.. Don't talk about Rama in my presence ever again. Sir.. Will you not have the tea prepared by Baburam? Yes.. yes.. I don't like if I don't have the tea... prepared by Baburam early in the morning. Drink it. You will have fun. Who is it? Sir, it is Prabhakar Chaturvedi. He is a very big Sanskrit Pandit. He has come to meet you. Baburam, bring a chair. - Come in. - Greetings. Greetings. Please have a seat. We came here for a change in weather. We heard that you were here too? My niece is with me too. She is a student of literature. And she is a very big fan of you too. Child. Ask blessings from him. From where will I give blessings now? I have finished all my blessings. Bless you, child. What is your name, child? Sudha.. What happened, uncle? Uncle? It is the same voice. What? What did you say? Nothing, it is a curse of my life. Where do you stay? She stays with me. She has a penchant for music.. Therefore, she stays with me and learns music. Even she liked music. Who? Mr. Sharma? Forget her. Forget her. Daughter.. will you sing for me? Yes, sing. This is a very good thing. It had bloomed.. A small bud had bloomed.. One day.. in the garden.. There was a light on the streets. What happened after that.. Nobody knows it.. A small bud had bloomed.. One day.. in the garden.. There was a light on the streets. What happened after that.. Nobody knows it.. The gardener reared it with great love. Even had it swing in the gentle breeze. The gardener reared it with great love. Even had it swing in the gentle breeze. What shall I say ahead? I can't say.. Should I stay silent? I cannot.. What happened after that? Nobody knows.. A small bud bloomed in the garden.. A florist came in the garden. God knows what magic he created. A florist came in the garden. God knows what magic he created. The bud broke and fell in the florist's basket.. What happened after that? Nobody knows.. Nobody knows.. A small bud bloomed in the garden.. Some one else lived in the gardener's heart other than the garden too. The bud cried a lot. Some one else lived in the gardener's heart other than the garden too. The bud cried a lot. The string was broken, the florist was lost.. What happened after that.. Nobody knows.. Nobody knows.. Nobody knows.. Who is it? Who is it? Why don't you speak? Me.. Me? Who is it? Me.. Prakash.. Laila.. - What happened, uncle? - What happened, sir? Who is at the door? There is nobody. She had come. Who? Rama. You must have dreamt it. No, child, I am telling you the truth. She had come. She had come to cry and apologize, I think. Please forgive her, then. Do the sins decrease if she is dead? I would have hated her as much if she was alive. But. If only she was alive. She is alive, sir. Who? Inder.. Yes, sir. I understand. So Rama.. Means.. Sudha Sharma.. has come with you? No, sir. She wasn't with me anywhere. Laila.. you please go away from here. I want to speak to Inder and Prakash. - Uncle.. - No, nothing will happen to me. You go. Go. I will ask you later... why you kept me in Inder Saxena's house? Why did you insult my blindness like this? Sir.. Mr. Inder.. You will feel strange if I ask you in your own house. But can I ask you...? What do you wish from me now? I wish to remind you of something you said sir. While giving a lecture on the 'Ramcharitramanasa'.. That just like how warmth doesn't become bad if it goes to a dirty place.. Just like that, Seeta hadn't become impure. - I want to say that.. - Sir.. Rama is like warmth. If you think my house is impure... Then Rama has not become impure. Okay? So you have come to teach me? No, sir. I have come here because.. Whatever we did was a game and madness. We didn't do anything to bow your head in shame. And even if you... Call this a small lie, it doesn't give your old age the right.. To throw a stone on the glass of their life. This is what I came to tell you. Prakash.. Don't ask anything now, sir. Let me ask you something now.. Your hand is on my head. Tell me. Can I do anything wrong willingly? No. Prakash. You cannot do anything like this. It is you, who has kept my faith in life alive. Then please agree to two of my requests without any arguments, sir. One, forgive Rama. And secondly, have her married off to Inder. What happened, Laila? Nothing. I will not be able to stay till your marriage. Therefore, I was crying. Mr. Inder.. you are a fast friend of Prakash, isn't it? Yes. Then, can you tell me. Why is having so much sadness at this age? Which sin is he being punished for? I know it. He has committed two sins. One.. he is a very honest man. And secondly.. he loves Rama.. What? Prakash.. Rama.. Are you telling the truth? Mr. Inder.. You don't know this much about your friend too? You don't know.. that a person.. Can place a bet about someone else.. Only when they love them immensely. Then.. does Rama.. Prakash? I don't know that. But Rama respected Prakash a lot. And that respect could have changed in love till now. If you didn't meddle in between with your buttery tongue. Hello? Yes, I am Laila here. Laila.. I am Inder.. Why did you go away all of a sudden? Uncles and Rama.. all were asking about you.. Will I not have to arrange for the marriage? Can you come here tomorrow with Prakash.. And Rama between eight thirty and nine? It is important. See, this is the last request of your brother. You will come, isn't it? Okay. Please come.. Please come.. Go ahead and turn right. You people? How did you come here all of a sudden? You told us.. Yes, but you should have called up and come. Why did you call us? I hear that you have arranged my marriage? You will always be a idiot. I am a rich man. If I wanted to marry.. Was there a dearth of girls in this world? You know that I am a contractor. I contract everything. Whatever I liked.. I asked the price, bargained and took it. Think about Rama. You placed a bet that she won't.. Even let you talk to her, and I said that.. She will be in my bed room in fifteen days. Why? Didn't I show you? Why are you standing? You acted very well in their presence. But I understand. This matter should be between us. This will be the case.. okay. Farewell. Dolly.. Dolly.. Thank you, very much. - Lakhna.. - Yes, sir? Close this big door. All who had to come, have come and gone. Dolly.. Prakash.. Laila.. Rama.. Nobody will come and go now. Sir.. Sir.. What is it? Prakash sir has given this letter. Inder, I am going out for a while. You had acted well even this time. But your sacrifice this time for me was a waste. I had heard what you and Laila spoke. I spoke to Rama. She respects me, and nothing else. So, there is no question of marriage with her. If she has ever loved anyone, it is you. It will be better for everyone.. If you marry Rama. If you think about me and your conscience troubles you.. Tell it.. be silent, I am paying the price. Yours.. Prakash. Rama.. I am not Rama. I am.. some money.. Which you want to give to some priest for your repentance. I don't have any life, or any wish. Rama.. This is strange. The two of you should bet, and I should lose. You should commit the crime and I shall pay the price? Come on, we will go to sir. Thank you. I know the roads in this city. I will go myself. No, Rama. We both will have to go. Because.. It is necessary for the both of us to ask blessings from father.
