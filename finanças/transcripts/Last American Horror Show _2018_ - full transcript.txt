[whooshing and banging] [ominous tones] - [Friend] Are you sure you're gonna go through with this? - Of course, I have to. - [Friend] You don't have to do anything. I mean, you don't know this guy. He could be a creep. Or worse, a mass murderer. - Well you know what, I want to. And besides, my love life has nothing to do with you. And Brian is not a mass murderer. - [Friend] I'm just saying, just because he's a Christian doesn't mean he's on the up and up. I mean, I'm sure Jesus trusted Judas and we know how that worked out, Ms. Christian Connection-- - Okay, just shut up. - [Friend] Well, I'm just saying why would you invite him here for your first date? I mean, what are you thinking? Gosh, it's like you might as well have a welcome banner that says, "Happy date rape, Brian." - Enough, Amanda, okay? I have enough problems trying to go out in public and you should know that. [sighing] - [Amanda] I'm sorry, of course I do. I'm just trying to protect you. - I know you are, but I just... I feel like... I don't know, I feel like I just need some normalcy in my life. And I feel like Brian [sobbing]. I feel like Brian could be the beginning of it, you know? - [Amanda] Look, I don't support the decision, but I support you. You hard up broad, you. [laughing] - You're such a bitch. [upbeat music] [ominous music] - [Amanda] Okay, well just give me the safe word. - What? - [Amanda] You know, a safe word. Like if he ends up being a creep or something, you say the safe word, I come out, I freak him out, freak him out and he goes home early. - You will freak him out. I... [doorbell ringing] Shit. - Safe word. - Oh my god, okay. - Safe word. - Um, I, blueberry pie. - [Amanda] Okay. - Okay. I'm all right, I'm together. Mandy? I just wanna say thank you. - [Mandy] Of course. What are sisters for? [doorbell ringing] - Angelina, I presume. I'm gonna take that as a yes. - Yes. I'm sorry. - That's all right. - I'm an idiot. - No, no you're not, I'm Brian. Nice to meet you. - Very nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you as well. - You too. - Thank you. - You look really good. - Thanks. You look even more beautiful than your profile image. - That's so sweet. Would you like to come in? - I'd love to come in, thank you. Beautiful place you got. - [Angelina] So, you're nervous too? - Can you tell? Yeah, it's not like I do this all the time. I'm really scared to death. You know, you could be a mass murderer for all I know. - That's so weird that you say that. My sister was just saying the exact same thing. - Your sister? - Mm-hmm. - Will she be joining us? - No, no. She won't be here tonight. - Okay. So, what's on the agenda for tonight? Maybe a hot game of Naked Twister? - Excuse me? - I'm sorry, that was totally inappropriate. I am really bad at telling jokes. I just want to apologize for being so bad at it. - Tonight, I wanted to scare the pants off of you. - Oh. You're talking about horror films, right? I just, I don't really do well with horror films. It's really not my thing. Maybe you have a nice, I don't know, faith-based film or a feel-good film we could watch, something like that? - Really? - [Brian] I guess I must've misread your profile on Christian Connection, I'm sorry. - No. Actually, I have a confession to make. - So, here it goes. You're gonna tell me you're not a Christian, right? I'm sorry, that's it, I can't do this. - Really? I just wanted to meet someone nice. - You know I'm joking, right? - You're a jerk. - You're right, I am a jerk. I'm really terrible with jokes too. - You really are. - I know, I gotta stop writing my own jokes. I tell you what, I'll make a little deal with you. Why don't we sit down and watch your horror films, I'll sit through all of them, and at the end of it, give me a little kiss. - But I don't even know you. - I know, but we're not talking about like steaming up the room or windows. I'm just talking like a little peck on the cheek. Let's make a deal. - Okay, it's a deal. - All right, cool. Let's make it official. Pinky swear? All right. Let's watch those horror films. [booming] - Hey, hey, the good stuff, good stuff, good stuff. - No, get the fuck out. - Hey look man, look, look, come on, you know I'm good for it, man. Come on, talk to me, all right? - I said fuck off. - Look, man, look, I got something for real now. Look, help me out, man. I just need a little help, look... Oh come on, man. - Good for nothing creep, that is what you are. If my brothers catch you here, we will mop the shit out of you like housekeeping. You are worse for wear. - Look, man, look, I got this score all right, look. You know I'm good for it. Just give me till Monday and I'll have it here delivered to your doorstep, I swear. Just give me this chance, man. - Why do you think I'd help you? - Look, I just got this score, all right? Look, cash in, cash out, I'm paying you in full in hand. Look, you... - Not anymore, you piece of shit. I'm not gonna look. Looking for everything, me. Or I will find you and I will carve out your eyes. - Okay. Okay. Okay. - [Gangster] Now fuck off. [tense music] [ominous music] - Lightweight. - Here stick, stick. - Don't waste that shit. - Fuck y'all. - Fuck off, man, it's not my first rodeo. - Oh, oh oh oh, look at this bitch right here. Look at that fucking cunt. See that shit? Fucking cunt. - How do you know she's a fucking cunt? - [Burglar] How do you know what she's driving? - Fucking bitch. - [Burglar] Let's get high. - [Blonde] Rick. - In the kitchen. You've been gone a long time. Did you get his wine? - Yup. I got your wine. - It's not my wine, it's his wine. What time is he gonna be here? What time is he gonna be here? - Pa's gonna be here at six. - All right, great, thanks. - Holy shit. - Whoa. What the fuck, man? How many people fucking live in this house? Is she expecting company or what? - Fuck, I don't know who the fuck that is. - Fuck this, Dan. Let's just go fucking hit another house. They piss gold over in West Side. - [Burglar] Yeah. - Hey hey hey. We stick to this fucking plan. We stick to this fucking house, you understand? - [Burglar] All right. - How do you know they have money anyway? - Oh, they do. - Yeah, well how do you know? Hello-- - Hey, it's because I fucking know. All right, that bitch is a fucking bank manager. Fuck. - Stop wasting gas, just what we need-- - Jesus Christ. - Whoa whoa whoa, hey now. Who do you think I am, Dean Martin or something? - Really, Dad? Two glasses are gonna kill you? - Yeah, drink up, she went all over town for it. - Really? If that's the case, you can top that baby off, sweetheart. [chuckling] Hey wait a minute here. You go through all this trouble and you're not gonna have a drink with us, hon? - Well, I can't right now, Dad. - Goddamn, I'm gonna be a grandpa. [laughing] Great news and congratulations, you two. - Cheers. - What the fuck's going on in there? - Probably in there jerking off. - Sit the fuck down, Jesus Christ. - Oh, we don't wanna miss that. We should probably hit 'em now. - Sit. Sit. - You know you love it. [giggling] Let's do this. - Shut the fuck up, Mitch. You sit the fuck back. - [Mitch] All right, shit. - [Dan] We go in when I say we go in. - [Mitch] All right. - [Dan] Fucking say it, Dolores. - We go in when you fucking go in. Good enough, captain? - So, have you made maternity arrangements at the banks? - [Bank Manager] Yeah, of course. I mean, it's not due till August, but it's all set. - And the plant, Rick? - Yeah, the plant, I don't want to... Let's not talk about it. - Dammit, Rick. - [Bank Manager] Dad, it's okay, we're gonna be okay. - Mr. Weniger, Friday is my last day. - Oh, that's just great. What was it this time? No, shit, I don't even wanna know. - Look-- - No, you look. Ever since you got back from war, you've had problems with authority, you've had problems with your temper. You're just not the same Rick that married my little girl. - [Rick] It's complicated, all right? - Complicated? Let me tell you about complicated. In '67, my platoon was patrolling a small village outside of Saigon. And all of a sudden, Charlie encroached us from our east flank. You know, I was greener than bird shit on my first tour duty. I almost pissed myself. Then, old Hopper from Dallas came out and he dragged me into a villager hut to take cover. I honestly didn't know what I was doing. Well, I hear footsteps outside the hut. So I slide on my bayonet and I wait. All of a sudden out of nowhere, this little Vietnamese girl, hell, she couldn't have been much older than 10, runs in, shouting at the top of her lungs. Now, I didn't know if she was getting in position or what. [muffled grunting] I didn't speak the language. So I take out my bayonet and I plunge it in her neck and I twisted it. [grunting] And that sweet little girl, she fell into my hands. She looked up at me as though she was saying, "Why?" For the love of God, what did I do? - Dad, that is enough. - No. Finish. - Charlie passes. We go out and attack them. So I carry this girl out of the hut and I place a little rag I found in the hut over her face. But as I get up, my commanding officer comes out and he just punches my lights out. So, when I come to, old Hopper picks me up on my feet. And I asked him, "What the hell's the matter with him? "She was tipping off Charlie." Old Hopper looked at me and he said, "No, Al, no. "She was just scared and crying for her mama." See, we were in her home. - [Rick] Jesus, Jesus. - So you try rolling through airports and having people yell baby-killer to you knowing what I did. You know, we did some good over there, but damn if we didn't come home with some pain. It was a simple mistake. Reckon it's one I've lived with for over 30 years. - [Rick] But you keep on living. - [Al] That's the point, Rick. Move forward and keep living. - That is enough horror stories for me tonight. You want dessert? - [Rick] I'm gonna get a drink. [screaming] - [Dan] It's time. - It's about. [ominous tones] - Hello, is someone in there? Excuse me. Hello? Please. My boyfriend just hit me. I just wanna use your phone. I got out of the car and I ran, I don't know... Please. - You expecting company, Rick? - [Rick] Look, we can call 911 for you. - [Dolores] I have nowhere to go. - Rick, open the door. - He's gonna kill me. - Rick, open the door. Open the goddamn door for the girl. - [Dolores] Please. - Come on in. - Are you okay? - And then I just got out of the car... - Are you okay, are you all right? - I'm okay, but you're not. [screaming] - Oh my god. - What the-- [beeping] - No, no, no, no. - Bitch. - We don't want your wallet. - Take my money. - What are you talking about? - Take my wallet. - [Al] Fuck these punks. They're not getting a thing. - [Dolores] Really, got something to say there, punk? - Fuck off, Dolores. - Aw. - Let her go. Let her go. Let her go. Stop it. [drums beating] - Zero fucks given. Trust in me, Pops. - Oh guys, guys, guys, let's just ease this tension with a little song. - [Rick] Think about what you're doing. - Smoking rocks is always fun. - What the fuck are you doing? Put down the goddamn guitar. Get to work. Get to work. - Rick, Rick, you look like a man that might have a safe, where you keep all your trinkets. [screaming] - [Rick] Take my wallet. - [Dan] Aw that's sweet. [shushing] - I'm trying to tell you. - [Dan] I'll just fucking cut you. If you don't cooperate, I'll slit her throat. Come on, let's get him up. Let's get going. - On your knees. On your knees. - Come on, Rick, come on. Just be nice. Give us some help with the fog, Rick. - [Dan] Come to the foyer. - I'll babysit, guys. [grunting] - No. [tense music] - Get your ass to sit. Woo hoo. All right, butt plug, what's the combo? [sobbing] [shrieking] - [Dolores] Here. Here. And maybe. - [Al] Help. Someone, please. - [Dolores] Now there's boss. - I wanna fuck you, come here. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. - Seven. No, I'm wrong. 11. - She's with child, you goddamn monster. - No, no, no, no, no. - [Dan] No wonder she's so hot. Yeah, I'm fucking her, yeah. - 18. [screaming] - [Dan] You fucking slut. [panting] [tense music] - Come on, come on, come on. - [Rick] 74. - [Mitch] Yes. - You ruined it, you ruined it for me. [gasping] [tense music] - [Mitch] So, who's the Marine? [horrific tones] [gunshot] [gunfire] [grunting] - [Dolores] You dirty bastard. [groaning] [speaking in foreign language] - Get up, soldier. - Your pop is-- [gunshot] [gunshot] - Is that the fucking best you can do? Come on. [gunfire] [sirens wailing] - [Rick Voiceover] But you keep on living. - [Al Voiceover] That's the point, Rick. Move forward and keep living. [laughing] - That was a trip. - You can say that again. Why don't you sit closer to me? I mean, just in case you get scared. - I'm gonna go get us some popcorn. - Sure. [booming] [whooshing] [bacon sizzling] - Charge said to him, "Okay, come back in 10 years "and get your car." "And he said, morning or afternoon?" [laughing] And the fella behind the counter said, "Well, 10 years from now, what difference does it make?" And he said, "Well, the plumber's coming in the morning." [laughing] [applause] [blow dryer whirring] [rock music] - Audrey, Clay, Toby, come and get it. - Hey, you hear your mother, move it. - Mom, Audrey keeps hogging the goddamn bathroom. - Clay, language. - For Christ's sake, Carol, he'll be an adult in six months. - Hell yeah, Dad. - Don't push it, Clay - Mom, Dad, can I please have this? - What the hell is this? - A sea critter, Dad, they're really cool. - Stupid. - Shut up, Clay. - [Carol] Sea what? - No, Mom, it's a sea critter that you feed and take care of. - Take care of? You've barely started wiping your own butt, champ and you wanna take care of something? Ha. - Honey, right now we really can't afford to buy an aquarium, and fish, food, and all it takes to care for fish. - Right. - Really, Dad, they're only $1.25. And he comes with everything it takes to care for him. - It would help him learn about responsibility. - All right. Here's the deal. You wash the car the next two Saturdays. - Deal. Oh, I need another buck for shipping. [easygoing music] [horn honking] [whooshing] [ominous music] Yes. They're here, they're here. - What's that, honey? - My sea critters came in the mail. - That's nice, honey. [ominous tones] - Boy, I can't wait to give you a name. [whooshing] [glass tapping] Clay, you jerk. - Clay, leave your brother alone. - [Clay] Loser. - Shut it, now. - Mom, I don't understand. I did everything right, and nothing. - [Carol] Are you sure? - Yes. - Well, maybe you got a bad egg, baby. Go get ready for school and I'll see if Dad will chip in on another order of those things. - Really? - Really. - Cool. - We can forget all about you, you bastard. [drain rumbling] [sighing] - May I be excused? - Yeah. - Toby, hold up a second. Let's go upstairs and talk in the tent. Come on, little man. - What do you want to talk about, Dad? - Mom told me about your little fish. - [Toby] It wasn't a fish. It was a sea critter. - All right, all right, my bad. Well anyway, she mentioned that you were real down and out about this whole subject and she thought that I should talk to you about raising pets. - I tried, Dad. - Hey, you tried. That's what matters. Come on, look at me, man. Besides, you got off easy. - [Toby] What do you mean? - Since you've been alive and a member of this entire family, do you recall us ever owning a pet? Ask your brother. Ask your sister. They'll both give you the same answer. Do you wanna know why? Because of Tippy. - Who? - Tippy was a bull terrier that I had when I was about your age. We went everywhere together. Now, she then tried to go to school with me almost every day. - [Toby] What happened? - What happened was, pardon my French, someone gave birth to the nastiest, soulless, witch from hell. Ms. Hart. She had it out for old Tips when she was a pup. Well one day, I came home from school and my mom tells me that Tippy attacked the old bat. Well, it was a false accusation, of course. But she had friends visiting from out of town who backed her story and also claimed getting attacked themselves. Hart was in good with the city. So they put an order out to capture Tippy and put her down. - You didn't let them, right? - Hell no. There was this wood area back behind my parents' house. I took Tippy deep into those woods and tied her up. I went back into the city and it was like she'd ran away. I mean, hearing that old girl whimpering and howling into the night, every night. That's when I knew she'd never be happy again. Have no freedom. She even started to develop an infection from the collar rubbing. She tried to free herself to come back to me. - Just cut her loose. - Would've done it if I could. She would've come back to me. - What did you do? - One day after school, I went to see Tippy one last time. Only this time, I brought my dad's old Remington. I let her loose to watch her run and play in the pasture. [horrific screaming] And then I took that Remington. I pointed it between her eyes. Bam. [screeching] And that's all I have to say on the subject of pets. Now go brush your teeth and get ready for bed. Grandma's coming for the weekend. - Oh. What a delight. [whooshing] - So, how did everyone's day go? - I crapped myself once today. - Grandma, that is gross. - He asked. - So anyways, Larry Henderson got his butt kicked behind the gym today. - And that's something to gloat about? - [Grandma] He probably had it coming. - [Carol] Mother, you're not helping. - You call me Sandra, or Mrs. O'Connor. - Ma. - Well, she is. - When are you gonna start popping out those great grand babies, huh? - Grandma. - Donald. - Ma. - What? It's the natural thing to do. - Ma, she's only 18 years old. - I was just a year older when I had you. Oh, and if I hadn't had that back alley abortion a year after, why, you'd have a half-black brother from boxer Joe Lewis. - [Donald] Ma, you know that's not true. [laughing] - Grandma was a player. - Maybe. - I don't believe it. - I'm through. I'm gonna go work on my ride. - How's that going, son? - Do you know how much... How many girls I'm gonna escort home once I fix my fuel pump? Do you mind if I'm excused? - [Carol] Yes, you may. - Grandma, you up for a game of checkers? - [Carol] Toby, you know you have to help with dishes. - Oh nonsense. That is work for the woman of the house. - Look, Sandra, we're trying to teach Toby responsibility. - Ah, horseshit, we're playing checkers. Oh, as soon as I watch my Henny Ben. - Cool. - Well, I have to go get ready for a date. - [Donald] With whom? - Johnny. I met him three days ago at a protest. - Oh Jesus. - We're just going for a ride. I'll be back early. [mimicking creaking] Grandma. He is a decent guy. Really, you should see him with his kids. - Oh Jesus. I need a hot shower. And a drink. Ma, you know you don't smoke. - Cheer up, Grandpa. Toby, set up the checkers in your room and I'll be down in 30. - Yes, ma'am. - And you, you get your ass on them dishes. I thought I smoked. Do I smoke? - Call me now. And let's be that there is ka-mel-ah. [soothing music] [water bubbling] [ominous music] - Son of a bitch. I swear, if I have to call the plumber again. [screeching] [horrifying music] - Ma... Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad. - What's up, buddy? I'm a little busy right now. - Something got Mom. It grabbed her from the sink. - Sorry, buddy. Can't quite hear you. Wait until I get out. - Okay. [ominous music] [screaming] - Are you perfect? Are you in pain? - Grandpa, where you been? Oh, the store. Did you remember to bring me my chocolate bar with almonds? [laughing] Oh, you brought me one of those on our very first date. I remember it like it was yesterday. I opened the door, and you were standing there in your Navy uniform. So tall, so handsome. Ah, just took my breath away. Oh, and then afterwards we went dancing. That big band sound was something. Afterwards, you took me home. It was so romantic. Full moon, you held me in your arms and kissed me. I knew you were the one for me. Oh, Grandpa. Where'd you go? Why'd you leave me? I miss you so much. I love you. Where are you? Where are you? Where are you? Oh, you went to the store. [laughing] Remember to bring me that chocolate bar with almonds. - [Toby] Grandma, Grandma. - Who the hell are you? - Grandma, it's me, Toby, your grandson. - No, I heard about you creeps on 60 Minutes. Coming to bleed me dry of my social security. - Grandma? [shouting] [whooshing] [sighing] - Audrey, we've dry-humped for three days now. I'm really starting to chafe. - I'm sorry, Johnny, I'm just nervous, I guess. Do you have protection? - Sure, baby. I always carry a crowbar in case we run into a pack of undesirables. - Jerk, you know what I mean. What the hell is that? - Some Spanish fly. You know, to get you in the mood. - I don't know. - So, baby, just pop it in your mouth, down it with this wine. - Then what? - Didn't you say your parents were sound sleepers? - I don't know, Johnny. - Come on, baby, just drink it down, go up to your room, and unlock your window. - Okay. - There we go. And Audrey? Put on something sexy. - See, Grandma? - It's starting to come back to me now. Who are you again? [sighing] [ominous music] [groaning] - Johnny. [moaning] Johnny. - You see, Grandma? It took her. I bet it was that sea critter. - Ugh. What I see is that your mom is a real pig. - Come on, let's check on Clay. - Toby, what the hell did you say that thing was? - I hope you didn't start without me. [squelching] You're into some kinky shit, aren't you? [sighing] Thank you, Spanish fly. [ominous music] What the? What's under here? Audrey, I didn't know you had a cat. [screeching] - It got him too. - What did? - The sea critter. I know it. Come on, let's get Dad. - Toby, why don't we go get your dad? I just don't know, Toby, I mean we looked in the sink and all I say was like a bunch of mess and then we went into the garage and then-- - Whoa, whoa, hold the phone, and what the hell are you two babbling about? - Dad, that sea critter that Mom flushed awhile back? Well, it came back. It's bigger, meaner, and eating everyone in the house. It got Mom, it got Clay, maybe even Audrey. - What he said. Donnie, look in the sink. - [Toby] Yeah, Dad, look in the sink. [ominous tones] - Let's go find everyone. - They're gone, Dad. - We'll see about that, come on. I'm gonna get my gun. [tense music] [screaming] - [Sandra] Donnie, what are you gonna do? - Screw this. I'm gonna call the cops. - You should call the cops. [tense music] Don? - Dad? [screaming] Dad. Dad. Dad. Dad. Dad. Dad. Dad. Dad. [screaming] - Back, I say, back. Toby, hold this, hold on. I've got something for that shit-head. - Get back. Grandma. Get back, get back. [screaming] Get back. Grandma, kill it. [tense music] [flame roaring] - Burn in hell, fucker. [door knocking] - Is this your residence? - You got a warrant? - No, Grandma, they're here to help. - We got a 911 call reported some screams coming from this here residence. Y'all know anything about that? - Well, apparently there's a whole lot of shit going on and we're here to keep the peace. - Hey, peace this, copper. You got nothing on us. - Son, your grandma, well she's not doing well, I take it. Hm? - Mister, you have to help us. You have to kill it. - Well hold on, hold on now. Kill exactly what? - Sheriff, please. It's in our house. Ate my mom, dad, and brother. Help us. - All right, kid, so where is this intruder at? - My grandma sprayed it with hairspray and it ran away. I have a sister. This is her boyfriend's car, sheriff. - Have you seen her recently? - [Toby] No. [gun cocking] - Show us her room. [tense music] - [Policeman] We have probable cause and we're coming in there whether you like it or not. [ominous music] [gunfire] [screaming] - Toby, in here, quick. Oh my god, baby, baby, are you all right? Oh my god, my-- - What are we going to do now? - I don't know, I don't know, I don't... [shouting] - You must learn to start grabbing the fly by the balls and squeeze, squeeze, I say. Squeeze. - Wait a minute. You said that thing was a sea creature, right? Right. It belongs in the sea. So, we will give him the sea. - How does this work? - Now, Toby, this is where you're gonna have to be brave, okay? What I need you to do is I need you to go down into your sister's room-- - No, Grandma, I'm scared. - Now, Toby, this thing was your pet. Accept the responsibility. - Grandma, this thing's a murderer. - Well, get mad. I mean, hell, he killed your father and your brother, and I mean, who knows what it did to your sister. - It took Mom too. - Well, Donnie could've remarried. - Grandma. So, I bring this thing here. What are you going to do? - You just bring it here and I will stick a lightning bolt up its puckered ass. [mimicking zapping] [tense music] [screeching] Run, Toby, run, run, hurry, hurry. Toby, I want you to get on the tub, balance yourself on that ledge. - Why? - Bait. Get your ass up there or we're both gonna die. Move, move, move. All right. [panting] [screaming] Eat lead, bozo. [zapping] Oh yeah, die. Ugly asshole. Die, die, die. Ah shit. [tense music] Stay away from my grandson, you salty son of a bitch. [screeching] [yelling] [whirring] [panting] Oh, Toby, Toby, it's dead. It's dead. [laughing] We won. We won. Oh yeah, oh yeah, we won, we won. Oh yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh man. [sighing] [somber music] [tense music] [screaming] [screeching] - Now now, it's almost time. - Time for what, Grandma? - Why, for my great grand babies, of course. - Wow. - That was awesome. What did you think? - I can see myself in your eyes. [door knocking] - You know what, I think that's the pizza guy. I ordered pizza earlier. Do you think you can get it? - I don't mind at all. I'll be right back. - Thanks. [knocking] - [Brian] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Pepperoni and sausage. - At least we know she likes meat, right? How much do we owe you? - 21. - Here you go. - Holy shit, are you guys watching a fucking horror movie? - Yeah, we guys are watching a fucking horror movie. - Won't you guys need company? - You're kidding, right? Does it look like we need company? - I get off in five minutes. - You know what, and in five minutes, you can march your sorry ass to your fucking house and never see us again, how's that sound? - Well, what about my tip? - Oh, your tip? Here's your fucking tip. Use it well, all right? - Motherfucker. - See ya, fuck you. Pizza's here. [booming] - Well, yeah. I think that I need a little time. - What? You put me through all this bullshit and now you're dumping me? - No, don't you dare put this all on me. - What am I supposed to do, turn my head against your all on the road womanizing? - Okay, I understand that traveling may be an issue but-- - Don't but me. You come home at odd hours of the night, clean your clothes, and then erase your inbox daily. Oh, oh, and here's the clincher.

I took a rock, hit him upside his head. - So you had anger issues. - [Stranger] It wasn't anger. I loved that dang dog. This was yearning. - Yearning for what exactly? - I had what Mama called the yearning. I had it real bad. - Old-timer, I don't know if I like this conversation too much. - You know, Mama used to say that the gall bladder of a living thing was the best eating. The most powerful eating. - I see you've met my pa. - Yeah, he's a real humanitarian. - He is, ain't he? [laughing] Did Pa tell you that he was a medic in the Special Forces back in Nam? But he got discharged. On account of too much yearning. - That's disgusting. - Nam was different. It was me or them. I see you have a bit of yearning in you. - [Traveler] Yeah, you could say that. - Well, so do I. - Oh, you're insane, man. [chuckling] Bathroom? Bathroom? [somber rock music] [ominous music] Fuck.
