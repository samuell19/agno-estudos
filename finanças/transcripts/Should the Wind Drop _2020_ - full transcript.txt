Passport... Hello. -Who is it? -A Frenchman. -How are you? -Good... Where are you taking him? To the airport... Alain... De... Alain Delon! Beautiful landscape! Latchin Corridor! Hurry up! The army likes speed. When are you coming to join us? I don't know... Good luck. What's happening? While the soldiers are filling up, have a cigarette. He says he's here for the airport. Have you come to open our airport? That's good... Everyone, back in the trucks. Let's go! Move over a bit. It's not a Sunday stroll. Stepanakert international airport! Like a bird... eagle, eagle... IF THE WIND FALLS Mr. Director, he's arrived. Mr. Delage? What a pleasure to have you! I'm coming, don't move. Mr. Delage, Korune Androssian, airport director. -Nice to meet you, Mr. Androssian. -Call me Korune. -And if it's OK, I'll call you Alain. -I don't mind. Did you have a good trip? Yes, eight hours after the plane is indeed a bit long. It's long, and it's our only road. So, how do you find our airport cathedral? It's nice. Very nice. From the road, I was able to see the two wings from each side of the tower, it's a success. Isn't it? And you haven't seen anything yet. Come, I'll show you around. Hello. Do you know if the runway is accessible? The runway? Of course not... Lieutenant! Lay down! Edgar, is that you? Did you bring me something? Where did you find it? In the forest. Come closer. Did you go near the border? I prohibited you from going! Do you understand what can happen to you there? I prohibit you from going there. Do you hear me? But you go there when there's shooting! I'm a captain! Do you understand? Captain! And you obey my orders! Understood? The man from the airport has arrived. Edgar... Where were you? I went to water the flowers on the grave. You're a good boy... come and eat. Hello. -How are you? -Good. Hello. -I'm going to Shoushi today. -Good. We didn't wait for you... to fly planes! Come back tomorrow, grandma is still sick. OK. Alain! Mr. Delage! Mr. Delage! Mr. Alain, this is Karinée Boghossian from the national TV -in Stepanakert. -Hello. Nice to meet you. My team is doing a report on the airport. They'll just take some photos with you. Karinée Boghossian is one of our most prestigious journalists. If you don't mind, I'd like for you to pretend you were alone. I don't understand. Visibly, Mr. Androssian didn't explain the principle of an audit. In fact, I'll hand in my report to the government in a week, it will be made public, from then, you can inform the population as much as you want... Can you pack up your cameras, please? I can see them filming me. Until then, I'll give no information, neither to you, nor the television, no one. OK? This is ridiculous, what you're doing, Mr. Androssian. I'm going back to work. Goodbye. You're here, Edgar... Bravo, pour me a bit of water... -May God protect you. -Good boy. -Edgar, here... -No, no, thank you. Thank you, dear... Boy, bring me some of your water. Thank you. Do you still not understand? You can't do that here! They're sick, poor people, aren't you ashamed? Don't come back here with your stagnant water! Do you hear me? What's happening? Audit, Stepanakert airport. Second day. Control tower. Interview with the controllers. The licenses are up to date. The hill was lowered by 25 meters so that approaches can be made from Armenia. Otherwise, I saw the kid on the runway again. That means the fences haven't yet been repaired. Landing system to instruments, the approach slope is coherent with the relief. However, if they have a mishap, the plane will have to fly over the ceasefire line, which is problematic. They're crazy to want to re-open this airport. -Hello. -Hello. Are you expecting someone? Yes. You. Alain, you must understand what this airport represents for our country. Do you see? We're convinced of one thing: as soon as the airport functions, as soon as Stepanakert can fly to Moscow, Paris, from that day, the international community will be obligated to recognize us. The eyes of all countries are fixed on you. Imagine if the report is negative. -It won't be. -Ah? In any case, we're not asking you to do your report on TV. Even if you want, I need agreement from my office to address the media. Look, Alain. Our people have experienced an unforgettable tragedy. Myself, I'm an orphan grandson of the genocide. They wanted to eradicate us from the face of the earth. Not just us, but all our traces, the memory of our presence. That's why I came to fight, to keep this land and protect the memory of those who perished. This war of independence, here, has caused more deaths in each family. But we've been able to get back up despite everything. Upper Karabakh isn't on your maps, but the country exists. With its fields of wheat, the schools, a president, a constitution. And your job here is more proof of our existence. Do you understand? My child, how I miss you... But don't worry. Edgar is here, and as long as he's here, it's OK... I look after him well. Eat, Edgar, my dear. Obviously, I have high blood pressure. We work all day: the vegetable garden, the potatoes, the beans, we cultivate, we harvest... Nvard, do you see Armen? I'm looking. He's coming. Keep going, Ophélia. What a shitty character you have. Did you sleep well last night? What is this? Look at this deluge! How am I supposed to do my job? Rimma, keep it down. They're in a meeting. That's three times this week... They need to learn how to turn off taps! That should be the measure for the ceiling. Yes. So, where is it? OK. OK. Or did they put the...? The temperature is... Turn on the speakers. Edgar! My father is asking is you're still selling the land? -No. -OK. Come here. Edgar! Edgar! Why are you running from me? Is your little business going well? Give me a bit of your precious water! Here! -No, I don't want it! -Take it! Apparently, they saw you again at the airport lately? Which airport? I haven't even seen this airport up close. You're a cheeky boy, aren't you? I've told you 1,000 times. Access to the airport is strictly prohibited! Especially at the moment with the expert. Go on! Good evening. On our show, we are today welcoming the auditor Mr. Alain Delage. Welcome to Karabakh, Mr. Delage. All this money for the airport! I'm just checking. I'm not making any decisions. I'll hand in my report to your government... and they will decide whether or not to open the airport. It might not be part of your responsibilities, but the right to travel is a fundamental human right... Yes, of course. You imagine that I didn't come all this way... Do you think I came all this way to prevent your planes from flying? If it were just up to me, the sky would be open to everyone. If it were just up to me, the sky would be open to everyone. A space with no limitations nor borders. If we want to sell the land, it's now or never. Ophélia... How beautiful you are... You won't sell the land. Why not, dear? I'll grow wheat there. The sun has fried your brain! No. You know we don't have money. With what will you grow wheat? I have some... Where do you have money from? That was the first Stepanakert-Erevan flight. It was an extraordinary event. At the time, people here had already fought for this airport. And... the first flight was a breath of fresh air. Me too, I left on a plane for my studies. And the year after, it was the war. The airport was bombed first. I came back by bus, like everyone. Does he have my mother's eyes? Speak quieter. -He has your nose... -Don't start again! Do you have enough milk? You ask so many questions... I need to know, right? I'm concerned for my son! Don't worry... As soon as the doctors turn around, Edgar comes past with his magic water. Don't tell me you drink it! Of course I do. And to think you went to university... Can you show me? I can't see. The light... He's eating his hand. -I'll take him back in. -Go, go. That's enough! It's midnight! You'll wake up the whole hospital! You're bothering everyone. It was to see my child. We were all very touched by what you said on TV. It's exactly what we needed to hear. And it was so... So poetic. You know, there's this problem of turn around if the weather conditions are bad. We won't need to turn around. Our pilots were able to land in the war. In any case, the border is 52 kilometers away. Not on my map. Obviously, I asked my office for a geolocation, I'm waiting for the response. I also asked Google Earth and they're very unclear on where the border it. Since when do we trust Google Earth? Nothing is less neutral than Google Earth. You know very well. And your map, you don't have the right map. Look. This border was traced by mediators from the Minsk group at the time of the ceasefire. It hasn't moved since. It's materialized on the ground. It follows a ridge. Just after this forest here. 52 kilometers. You can check. The airspace is under international reign, so the sky above Karabakh belongs to us. There is no risk of being shot down, I repeat, neither on the ground nor in the air. Do you still get it from the old source? Yes. Are you still able to get in the tank? Yes. These idiots. They think they can control everything from their tower. But it's from here we see best. Do you know what's in the hangars? Yes. What? Everything... Everything what? Everything... Everything you can imagine... That's enough. Sit there. You think you're big. -What's wrong with you? -Stop! I told you, man. A 'KA-52 Alligator' flew over the border. Don't be stupid! We don't even have one! Shut up! I saw it, I'm telling you. The war is over. Civilian planes will come. There's already one... huge! Where do you live? On Mars? Are you an alien? It's true! The Frenchman told me! Huh, you know everyone! Apparently, I don't have the right map. The border is 52 km away and not 25 like on mine. Can you send a geolocation? No, we're not speculating with a border. OK, thanks. Bye. There's nothing here... -What are these rags? -They're uniforms, banana... Look at what this idiot eats... Put your helmets on. Come! I found one. What are you doing? Mind your own business! Take the weapons. -That's for me! -Here! It's beautiful. And the cartridges? -It's here. -Where? Let's shoot them! None fire? Yes, they fire! It's powerful! A real fire! Look at this fire... Shoot! Shit, bunch of little assholes! The sons of bitches! I'll catch you one by one and cut your ears off! This is Erevan. I'm transferring to you flight Armavia 75-64 from Erevan to Stepanakert. Roger. We're waiting for it... We'll get it with the landing light. The sky is open. The weather conditions are good. You're lucky! Hello, Stepanakert. This is Armavia 75-64, level 106. Information DELTA, QNH 1005. Hello, Armavia 75-64. This is Stepanakert. Wind 65.5 degrees. Visibility over 10. Atmospheric pressure 1013 hectopascals. Roger. I'll continue to 30 - Stepanakert. Roger. The last 55 km. This is Armavia 75-64. Starting descent to Stepanakert. Armavia 75-64. Continue your descent. Contact the tower on frequency 116.8. This is Stepanakert control tower. Continue your descent. Landing authorized. Runway 5 free. Last wind at 65 degrees. Roger that. Runway 5. Armavia 75-64. Bravo! Send the runway agents! What is that, my God... This is sabotage. Yes. Hurry up. What are you doing here, Karinée? -It's just fire. -What's happening? It's dry grass... You can't speak about it. It's our duty. This really isn't the moment. Will it harm the audit? Drop the camera... It's smoke... Look at this mess! I'm sure someone has thrown their cigarette in the bush! If I catch them... No one would want to be them... They'll dirty the whole runway. He's killing me! What are you saying? I'm telling him about your ear! I'm saying... I wonder where the other half is? I gave it to the motherland. Alain... and Karinée Boghossian? Is she as beautiful as on TV? He says no. Ophélia didn't return with the other cows. No, no, I'm sure it's because of the fire. I know Ophélia. She's not the type to be late. Yes, yes... It's nothing... Yes, I'll keep waiting. We'll see. Seirane, today, I'm paying for the vodka! But me the baby! Me the vodka, you the baby. With this glass, you can drink for our Seirane's son, little Tigrane! What a pleasure! To Tigrane's health! May he grow up with his parents. -Future soldier of our country. -There are enough soldiers. Ah, are you a pacifist now? A boy will become a soldier, that's how it is. King Tigrane the Great! To Tigrane! Congratulations! To little Tigrane! Congratulations! May his parents be in good health. -A soldier deserving of his country. -Thank you. I know the Japanese did a scientific study on us, the people here. Translate so I can continue. A hundred years? Another glass. Fill his glass! But that's not it! Then, they continued their study... The Japanese continued... And you know what they discovered? That if we stop drinking, we can live to 200 years! We're like that here! I don't know how we do it! Let's drink to live long! How do we say 'mulberries'? 'Mulberries'. He has to eat something with it! They say you're not drinking properly. Let's have a toast for you and our planes! For the planes! Yeah? Yes, I'm OK. Look, everything's OK. Yes, everything conforms. I just have this uncertainty with the border. You didn't send me anything. What do you mean? Which one? On foreign affairs? You want me to give him a negative report, is that it? No, if there's no one to read it, I'll stop. OK. No, no problem. Yes, see you Tuesday. Ophélia! Ophélia! Ophélia! Armen! Armen! Ophélia! Ophélia! OK. Turn the generator off and on. OK. I think you have to go there. Shall we go? Let's see! Give it to me! So it doesn't get cold... Hide under the trees! Lay down! Is Alain with you? -Tell him not to worry. -Don't worry. Stay with him. Garegine! How long do we have to wait here? We can't stay here... We have to get out of here fast. Where's Alain? Alain! Alain! Alain! Alain! Get up! Get up! It looks like him. Put your hands down! Here! Everything is fine! Armen found him. We took him with us. OK, take him. -Is my office aware? -No. We waited for the last moment. We hoped to find you quickly. Such a violation of the ceasefire... Was anyone injured? No. We can't re-open the airport. Not now, in any case. The minister is preparing a communication. We'll have to wait for the tension to pass. This is what we call living on a volcano. We never know when it will wake up again. But it doesn't change anything. We believe. I'm sorry. No, it's not your fault. What did you think you'd find? Barbed wire? A line on the ground? Did you really think your certification would allow the airport to re-open? It's much more complicated. They won't let us fly. We're not ready to see a plane at this airport. Do you think I did all this for nothing? Hold the center. Careful, stay straight... Now push the variator... Pat Anderson Subtitling: Hiventy
