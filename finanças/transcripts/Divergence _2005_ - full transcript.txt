Winnie It's so late. Mrs. Lam, I feel like I'm being followed. Don't be silly My hubby is waiting for me, some way ahead. Don't worry. You are scaring yourself. Anyway, you'd better find a day time job. It is not a place to walk in late at night by yourself. Toilet. He needs to go to toilet. Have a shit or a piss? What's the difference? I need to go now. Is he Mr. Suen? Piss. I'm done. Don't keep staring, idiot. Are you Mr. Suen? Bingo! I am right. Haven't seen you hosted the Police Voice show for a long time? I quitted that show for years. Look at him, he looks much handsome than he was on TV. You are a real cop, right? Stupid! Every host in that show is a real cop. Really? Mr. Suen. Yes, he is with me, we'll back to the station in 15 minutes. I am hungry; buy me a bowl of wonton noodles. Okay. You can have whatever you want after the case finishes. But not now. Wonton noodles? Give you shits. Move! Don't stop! Don't come back I am sorry, Barrister To. Never mind. We still don't know whether Hung has got any key documents. So, I would like to keep my original thought. We shall focus on attacking the credibility of Hung, the witness, your former accountant. Five years ago he worked in the FTC At that time, he was strenuously censured by the SFC. He was being accused of complicity with clients, cooking the books. Now I just want to know, my former accountant testify against me. Can I not go to the Court? And, even if I can get off, it will take me at least a year or so, right? When can I get back my frozen money? Mr. Yiu, there is an urgent parcel for you. Open it. Yes, sir. Mr. Yiu. This pillow is specially designed by my therapist for me. Nothing is better to have a good sleep, right? Ask Chuen to wait for me downstairs in 15 minutes. Yes, sir. Sit. Don't you worry can't sleep well? No. I have managed on a few hours' sleep since I was a kid. Well. The lesser you sleep, the smarter you are. I heard that Einstein slept for only two hours a day, same as my son. He fools around till dawn. After a few hours' sleep, he gets up for singing and dancing practices, or meeting the press. See, he had dark circles under his eyes when he took this picture. He looks great after the CG. His new album will be released next week. I'll ask Judy to send you one. Thanks. This morning, at 3:20 am, the witness Hung Chi-man, who involved in a money laundering case was shot to death while he was being extradited from Canada. Can you explain how did the murderer know which flight you were on? Maybe someone in Canada leaked it out. Or they could get the information from the airline network. What they need is just to know my name. Apart from your subordinates, does anyone else know you took that flight? I've told you, I never told anyone. You are interrogating me, am I a suspect now? I haven't bathed yet. You're also a cop. When you take a statement from a witness, you will do the same. The witness now wants to piss. Okay. Has the finger-print report come yet? Not yet or no findings? No finger prints. They are experts. If you can get their finger prints, they are not experts. Why did you cut my line? Damn you! Have you found out the source of the gun? What the hell are you doing? Police! Police! Show me your warrant! You are a cop, you should know the rules. I am To Hou-sang, Mr. Yiu's attorney. Think twice before taking every step. Boss Jim is on the line. Any good news? It's almost done. Give me a few more days. A few more days. How many exactly? It's really almost done. I am very concerned about it. Really! I don't think so. I saw you on the entertainment pages yesterday. Hugging your son, you looked so happy. Don't read the entertainment pages, read the front page tomorrow. You shall be happier. I can't quit. I enjoy reading the entertainment pages everyday. I am your son's big fan. I follow him everyday. Where does he go, what pills does he take... I know everything well. Better than the paparazzi. My son's songs don't suit you. I promise, sure everything will be okay. I get stuck in heavy traffic. I don't want it. Damn your traffic! Make a U-turn then. Now the witness is dead, this case has been handed over to the Serious Crime Bureau. Who killed him or who leaked out the information? Now leave it to the Serious Crimes Bureau. You guys are not green. You should know Hung Chi-man is now dead. All the evidences produced by him were gone, useless. On the other hand, this case is at an dead end. Yiu Tin-chung has applied to the court to release his frozen assets. I believe that it still take some time for the judge to proceed the release. But it won't take long. Now, Jim Pak-tat is our only lead. Chu, debrief us. Sir, I have followed Jim's file from the very beginning. He carries diplomatic visa. Their embassy knows we are investigating him. He filed several complaints against us with the Security Bureau. Chu. I don't want to hear the history. We have to make every damn effort to nail Yiu only for his money-laundering. I don't care about any other things. Save face for the unit this time. You'd better go home earlier to take some sleep. Can't sleep? Well! Let's go karaoke. Don't like it? How about dancing? No dancing, alright let's go dining then. No dining! Race me to the end of the road. Look at you, look like shits. Watch out! Don't back up! Get out from the Admiralty station, and then take the bus 103. Get off at Pokfield Road. Walk straight for further five minutes. Right, find Uncle Choi in the Missing Person Unit. See you at the entrance. Don't forget to bring your bottle of herbal oil. It's late, why do people still come to I.D. The body? Every mother must be hurried to know... whether the one lying here is her missing son. If you ask her to come tomorrow, she can't help but wait for the dawn. If she proves it is not her son, she could believe her son would live at least for one more day. Just like them, what makes you come this late? After a long-haul flight, I can't sleep. It's ten years, what are you still waiting for? That's the point. How can a person disappear for ten years without leaving any clues! You are a cop! Bruce Lee, where was he? Tell me. Your girl has no emigration records in these ten years. How big is Hong Kong? How come you still can't find her? Maybe, she had an accident. Lost memory, doesn't know the way home! Will you shelter a stranger for ten years? Not even a cat or a dog. Whenever I raise those possibilities you give me the same answer. Such perfectly consistent statement surely you'll be a good witness. It is the fact. Admit it. You just don't want to face reality. Buddy, how can you be a cop? Doesn't the duty of a cop mean to find out the truth, doesn't it? You'd better apply for a transfer to my unit. I am getting retired two months later. You're off soon? Very soon. Listen, your body clock stopped, change your battery. Don't touch it! It's a male, none of your business. I can hear she's calling me the whole day. Don't say that outside this room. If your boss hears that, He would probably send you to the asylum. Idiot! What are you eating? What do you think? Spaghetti Marinara, for sure. So pretty! I wish the time would stop right at this moment. Stop! It stopped. You're always mine! Such dance scared the hell out of me! Is that a rehearsal or not? They seem lack of practices. Whatever! Let's back to the work. Do you see anyone from the Serious Crime Bureau? They may disguise themselves as the waiters. Or, the fans. Push someone into the water! I should have transferred to the Serious Crimes Bureau. Those are nicer jobs. To's wife Amy I should have asked for 20 percent more. The buyer is a billionaire. It's finished. Don't mention it again. You don't need to know who paid you. I told you not to come back. You just don't listen to me. Thinking of the money, I remember Lo taught me that, women and money, they forget you once you leave Didn't Lo tell you this? He was once paid by fake money. How dare it cheat a killer! Killer, so what? That day in the airport, just half second late, or half inch wide, I would have killed that cop. I know that cop. He is Mr. Suen who anchored the Police Voice. Does this matter to you? I knew his girlfriend. Jump, jump Hey, come down, too. Let's play something else. What's up? Go to hell! Not so soon. Hey, get some beer. Do you want to fool me? Yiu Ha! Where are you? Stop hiding! Come out. When did you last see your son? Last Sunday, he went home for dinner. Are you living together? He stayed in the yacht lately. Have you checked the yacht? Sure. Then, in the yacht, did you notice anything wrong? Let's say, any sign of fighting! Or is it messy? Have you called the record company? Is he out of town for MV recording or promotion somewhat? No. Did you receive any calls for ransom? No. Does anyone want to harm you? Commercial Crimes Bureau. Mr. Yiu Ha has been missing over 48 hours. As the father, sure he is not in a good mood. Hope you'd understand that. Mr. Yiu, it is a matter of routine. The more information we get, the faster we may find your son. If you agree, I'll arrange setting taps on all your phone lines. It's most probably a kidnap. Tapping... tapping my lines! Guess what! They tapped all my calls long ago. Any news? When can I get back my frozen money? Be more patient, shall be within a week. They shall have no further excuse. A week? I am running out of patience? And my son... Are you saying that the missing of your son and this case are related? They are putting pressure on me to return the money. They may suspect me of embezzling the money, so they kidnap... Are you sure? This is one of the possibilities. They give me no damn answer. Maybe, that bastard son overdosed on his pills. Or, it is a real kidnapping. Anyway, anything could happen. Otherwise, I won't report it to the police. You have someone for doing dirty work, right. Yes, I get a private eye. I've tried my people on it. Your guys have to be gentler; I don't want to screw them up. Understood. Yes, To hired me to find Yiu Ha, but... you know, he is the big big lawyer. I can never meet him in person. I met only the small folks. Sure, I am not the only one working for To. Chan and Fat Kwan also take his jobs. Fine, do you find anything then? Who did it? Mister Suen, I'll speak to you if I can speak. Buddy here, buddy there when you need my money or help. Now you call me Mister. Just return your buddy a favor this time, okay? I might get killed for this. Just can't tell. I have to go. By the way, tell you another lead. It's just hearsay. I take no responsibility. A girl called Ting, a new face. She is very active recently. She is an agent of assassins. All of them are pros. Have you told the Serious Crime Bureau? You think I am a patron? Who is looking for Ting? Doctor Chan suggested me to order a health pillow from you. Wrong number. This site contractor keeps a mistress. That woman broke his safe. Took all his stuff Then mess up the place, make it look like being robbed. That's so cheap. Turn him down. You don't take this job, someone else does. Are you insane! Take such a job will Ruin our reputation And you promise me that you work only for me. I don't remember that. Indeed, I'll give it to someone else and sleep with him. Thank you. Son Of A Millionaire Disappeared Mysteriously Yiu Ha Has Been Missing For Ten Days All here. That's all we got. When will the photographer come back? He is a free-lancer; he's not in this office. Our magazine can't afford to hire so many paparazzi. Here are 20 something pictures. Will there be more with him? Sure, you know he is a free-lancer. He must take as many as he can and sell to as many magazines as possible You just can't do anything with them. Where can I find him? Thomas Thomas Liu I didn't kill that guy. Trust me, Mr. Suen. You're tired. Get away! Police! Stop! Take cover! No! No! Don't do that! Stop, please! I have something to tell you. Shoot. I am pregnant. My baby! I've got a son! Junior Suen. Then we'll have our baby welcoming party right after the wedding banquet Bravo! I've got a son! Wonderful! I've got a son! I am a father! Fong! Fong! Hang on! Don't sleep! Call an ambulance! Here is Central Market. Calling backup, one officer down. Seal off the area now! Yes sir. A Cop Ran Into The Suspect And Started A Street Chase. I didn't kill the photographer. You know how much I charge for killing. I know, it is for fun, huh? I'm a killer. I should do something out of charity occasionally. Hey, you want to beat me? Don't be so stubborn. If you are capable, sometimes you need not follow the rules. Look at them. If I want to, I would have been one of them. Why did you make contact with that cop? Why didn't you listen to me? You have gone too far. That something really stuck in my mind, I just want to do it, and did it. If I was that obedient, I wouldn't have been a killer. 15:00 There is a cargo ship to the Philippines. Good, I can go diving. Look at you! Your head's bleeding. Wounds on foot. What the hell were you doing there? I asked you to pin a tail on Yiu. Stop! Stop! You have the right to suspend me. I also have my right to say that I am not wrong. Money laundering, killing witness, the missing of the suspect's son. All these might be connected. If you don't look into them, you'll never know. Yes, your girl has been missing for 10 years. Is that also connected here? Following orders obeying your commander, no private investigation. These are the basics for all the police. Except you. Lucky you, the autopsy report stated that the photographer died over 20 hours. And Chu can confirm your alibi. If not, someone must say that you are mad, killed the son of the suspect, and was pictured by the paparazzi, and murdered the witness Do you think you can say you are not involved? Think about if you were me the witness was shot dead right in front of you. What would you do, sir? You're trash! Defendant, please stand up. Now this court finds on the charge of D.D. Possession against Wong Man-kit verdict of not guilty and that he be acquitted accordingly. Mr. To! It's Mao Wai-ben. Congratulations, can I talk to you for a few minutes? You should contact John. I know, but for this time, I think I should talk to you directly. Have you found Yiu Ha? Take a look at these pictures first. From bank tomorrow You'll get the notice of the release of your frozen money Thank you. By the way, I have something to show you. It's from my private eye. Apart from Yiu Ha's yacht, there were eight other yachts on that day, According to the records of the pier, That ship docked at 21:00. And departed at 22:43. It's a leased ship. The leasing company didn't disclose the identity of the lessee. Leave them to the police, they'll find out very soon. Mr. Yiu if you still can't find Yiu Ha after your money is released, do you still think that it was done by your Boss? When my elder son was knocked down to death by a car, at least I know what happened. Please let me know whether my only son is alive or not. I am not involved! Hey, Baby. Psychologist Moca! Run! 123 up! Do you know Mao Wai-ben? We used to patrol together in Kwun Tong. Do you know him well? We go out for dinner every once in a while. When did you last see him? Last Wednesday. After quitting the force, he becomes a private detective. I have asked him for some information. What kind of information? The case of Yiu's son. What did he give you? Nothing. At the photographer's house, other than the suspect, did you see anyone else? Nope. Really! I know what would happen if I give a false statement. What happened to Mao? We found his body. The photographer might have been killed by the same murderer. The security guard of that building said that he saw Mao there the night before. Mao ran into debt. The pictures of the photographer may turn his situation around. I think I can take over Mao's job. Take it easy! (Pakistan) Bye! Bye! Take it easy! (Pakistan) You know Indian! I don't know you are so smart! That's Pakistan. To work here, I have to learn more languages, even though just a bit. If the Head knows it, I'll be fired. I'll pay the rest of your living. I have all sorts of interest; not even a millionaire can afford paying my living! You? You're going to be fired. You'd better mind your own ass. Look at you, smell like corpses. How many days that you haven't bathed? Would that make you take pity on me? Mao was being strangled See the deep gash on his right neck. The murderer is a left-hander. The gash is thin; it must be a wire again. Again? A similar case happened last month. I don't know the wire is on sale, or the left-handed killer is on sale. Left-hander again? I went with a family to I.D. That body. It's a MP (Missing Person). Give me that file. The body was found and the case was closed. The papers must have been sent back. Well, find Leung Tek at Shumshuipo Police station. Tell him you're my friend. Suen, don't blame me. I have to tell you again... Uncle Choi, you know, I just can't stop. If I stop, I'II... Back to ten years ago? Lately I saw a person. She looks utterly like Fong. So, go and pursue her. There's nothing worse than you are now. She is married, has kids, and is living in a big house. She is blessed. Every time I see her house lighted. I have an illusion that. Fong is waiting there for me to have dinner. Why don't you think of it this way? Actually, Fong is still alive. And you have broken up with her, okay? Okay, find Fong for me. Then I break up with her. Suen, you don't need to find Leung Tek. Go to find Chan at the funeral home. Cause you are a dead man. Two morning walkers found the death body in an alley at Nam Chong Street The victim named So Fu-on, 28 years old. A staff in a convenient store nearby witnessed that he bought something that night. But his two thousand dollars were still with him. He wasn't a decent guy. He had two previous criminal convictions. Both are indecent assaults. For the first time, he was sentenced to be bound over. For the next time, he was sentenced to jail for half a year. Last year, he was charged with rape and murder. Since there was only circumstantial evidence, he was not found guilty. The victim was only 13. Poor girl. Would it be done by the victim's family? I've checked, but I don't think so. The murderer is quite a character, like using wires. Shouldn't it be easier to buy a sharp knife? Maybe the killer is an obsessive hygiene addict. With obsessive cleanliness, with a strong power, and left handed. I, myself, haven't seen such a murderer before. To Hou-sang And The Firm. You can't beat me to it. Drive off! I have something good for you. These pictures were taken from the photographer's house. I guess the photographer saw Yiu Ha brought the LSD, They were so sneaky, so he took the pictures. Never miss a single opportunity. To Hou-sang sold pills to Yiu Ha? Does it look like that? You should ask what To came for. Only these two pictures? Not just two, there's many. But those are useless to you. The one who killed the photographer took the CD-R away. But he forgot about the hard disk. That guy is not familiar with computers. How do I know if those pictures are not fake? I don't know what you want. I also don't know what I want. Why do I pick you, a suspended police among the force, for help? Maybe, I want to show you... If I were a cop, I would have been a better one. Should you actually be a cop, you'd know that it's much easier to be a criminal. You have rules to comply; sure you can't react at will. Sometimes, the police should play the role of crooks. And the crooks should play the role of the police. That would be fun. Many of your buddies welcome quick money. Otherwise, no one would know which flight you took that day! That made you meet your Waterloo at the airport. Keep driving! Return it to me! If you don't want to die, keep driving! Someone asked me to tell you. Your girlfriend is dead. It was just an accident. It was quick. No pain. Mr. Jim. Any good news? Tell me. My son has been reported missing for fifteen days. Isn't it for promotion? Do you know where he is? How can I know that? Answer me. Is he with you? Okay, I answer you now. My boss can't stand the waiting any longer. If you can't fix it, not only your son disappeared, you and I would disappear too. Don't get me embroiled. Let me heat some milk for you. You'll have better sleep then. That's nothing, go back to sleep. If you change to handle civil cases, you must have less trouble. That's easier said than done! We just spend lesser and save it up. We can sell this house and the other two apartments I believe that we can pay off the loan. Where shall we live if we sell all our properties? Rent a house, just like most of the people do. No way! I can't lose. Lose some money, but you can earn a comfort life. I am comfort. I used to be a light sleeper. Come on, go to sleep. Has Yiu got his money back? Don't ask. You need not know that. Come on, go back to sleep. Hubby... Can you pick your own case next time? I have no choice! They all said they're innocent. If there is one real innocent person in every ten cases, at least, I do one thing correct. You hired someone to kill me! And you asked such a shit to kill me! Who do you think I am? You stupid ass! Why do you come back? Why? Don't you think you deserve to die? Don't you think you deserve to die? You should have died for 10 times already! You deserve all that happened to you today, you know that? In this world, don't you think you're the only killer and I am the only agent, don't you? You, stupid! Damn you! I just know buyers are all around the world. Call your buyer. Tell him I need 3 million to settle it. Otherwise, ask him to read the newspaper tomorrow. Please bring my son back to me. Please guide me through this. Send me back my son What do you want to eat? Wonton noodles? I had that yesterday. Get off! I won't let you die before I get the money. How many shots do you think you need to kill me instantly, painlessly? Don't shoot at my head, my face? You really love your look. Anyway, until the neighbor smell the stink, and the police come in, maybe worms are already all over my body. I won't be good looking by then. Forget it... Okay, I'll let the police compete with the worms, is that all right? He has wired the money. Do you think you can still spend the money You never know before trying. From this oracle, The first part means the land, the second part means the sun. The sun's down the land becomes dark, it means difficulties. So you have to be patient and keep your faith. Wait and get prepared, so you'll get it over. Mr. Yiu, the police called, saying that they found a body. They want you to identify if it's young master. You said I'd face some difficulties. Does it mean my son...? It's an emperor story. At the ancient time, the General was locked up. At last, he took a rebellion... He toppled the reign of a tyrant. I dreamed of a coffin, my husband was sleeping inside. People around dragged me away. Suddenly, my husband sat up and told me that. He wanted to have lunch with me. People sometimes see relatives leaving them in their dreams. Your husband is in a mood again lately. He got many tough cases. Men are always not willing to admit they have emotional problems. He likes his job. At the same time, he hates it. It's because he has to help someone who doesn't deserve it. Or, he shouldn't measure who deserve it or not. I know and my husband knows it too. Actually he knows they're guilty. So, he finds it very painful to keep working. He feels confused. If you were him, what would you do? Since the figure and the age of this victim is similar to the descriptions of your son, Mr. Yiu, please. Mr. Yiu, are you okay? I can't find a single thing that looks like our young master, are you just fooling? Mind your words. Now, sign and leave. Find Boss Jim for me, I want to talk to him. Yes, Mr. Yiu. Give me back my son!... Hurry up! Give my son back to me! What are you doing? No! My son... Your son died more terribly than you are going to be. Good! That's called doing justice to the world! It's not easy to kill Yiu Tin-chung. But, you hate him so much, killing him can't satisfy you, right! So you stole the person he loved. And make him so anxious to do something stupid, finally killing himself. Every time you kill, have you thought about the consequences? Do you get something wrong in here? I am a nice guy. I am a good attorney. You need to support your case by evidences. You have no witness, so I'll win. I know the laws. All because of you trash. I just helped you to clean up the mess. Have you thought of your family? Have you thought that you have done something bad to her? You follow me everyday. You can see that. You know I am a nice guy. I follow her everyday. She is not happy, do you know that? You are so weak. Stupid ass, why didn't you kill all those bastards? If you can't do it, let me do it for you. Let me do justice to the world. Why did you lock her up? She is sad, do you know that? Why did you lock her up? No! No! Let him go! Fong! Let him go! He killed many people! He will hurt you. I beg you to let him go! You will kill him! We can be together soon. I've found you for ten years. I have also found you for these ten years. I've been waiting for you. I feel so bad. Hubby! Hubby! Don't come over! Hubby! On that day, I squatted down to avoid that shot, just because I suddenly thought of you. You are the last woman that I should trust in this planet. I am really so bad If you have chance, you'll kill me for sure. Two erinaceous sheltered from rain together. You saw it yourself or you just heard that story? What if one erinaceous and one crocodile, do you think they can make it? It depends on how long the rain lasts. Is your real name Ting? What? Ting is a nice name. We got the lab report. The skin tissue in So Fu-on's nails, matches the DNA of To. So, To Hou-sang admitted that, he killed So Fu-on during the time he suffered from a mental disorder. How about Yiu's son? He said nothing regarding him. We still can't find the body. We have a vacancy here. Why don't you apply for a transfer to here? I've found a better place. Really? Where? I'll take up Uncle Choi's duty. For the Missing Person Unit? It's a boring job. You have to go to the morgue all the time. Not exactly. Finally, someone missing would be found. Finish her off! Do it! This is the first time!
