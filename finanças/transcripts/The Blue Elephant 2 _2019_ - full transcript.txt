Ibrahim, Haven't I introduced you to him? Is there anything to eat? You are drunk. -A courtesy drink. -Yehia doesn't drink to be polite. You haven't takern you insulin for two days. I'm fed up with shots and being ill. Fed up with shots, with being ill, with kids, the house! You must be fed up with me too. Listen, why don't we postpone your grudge for six months? or for ever? Why don't we travel? My birthday is coming soon. I want to see the sea. But let's go without the kids. Let's go to Hurghada. All my friends are there. Don't interfere. Now go get dressed, you will be late for your training. Lubna, be easy on her, she is almost as tall as you. I'll do whatever you want, when I'm done with work. I may go to Abbaseya hospital today, the director needs my advice on a case. Could they hire me again? Where? We agreed not to re-open that door I didn't open any door. This is the hospital. Dr. Yehia Rashed I have an appointment with Dr. Akram. Your ID. Dr. Yehia Rashid I have an appointment with Dr. Akram. He's waiting for you. Open the door. Dr. Yehia Rashid. Dr. Yehia Rashid. Come in, Doctor. Hello. Have a seat, please. I deeply apologize, bringing you here without any notice. It looks like you drink coffee without sugar. Correct, And water please. He greeted me coldly. He's obsessed with order. He won't take off his glasses to hide his swollen eyes. He still drinks. A coffee and water. Which hospital are you in now? I'm working as a PR manager in a real estate company. Whoa! Real estate? you have gone far. Anyways, I won't waste your time. A half-smile. He hides his contempt, because he needs me. Yesterday, there was a murder in the ward. None of the patients remember what happened, collective amnesia Except one, who probably bit off the victim's ear. When we talked to her, she asked to see you. Farida Ebeid. I don't know her. But i heard about her case on social media. He didn't look into my eyes. It's hard to trust a body language expert. Farida Ebeid, slaughtered her daughter and her husband, locked herself in a room And swallowed the key. She claim to have forgotten what happened. It's likely she's trying to claim isanity, by commitiing another crime. Maybe she had a shock that her brain can't handle. so it stopped "recording" events likely to ruin her existence. I'm glad you remember your psychiatry. Let's go. I did my doctorate in the UK and worked at Bradmoor hospital. Then they asked me to be manager of "8 west" female ward, so i came back. Opem, Walaa. The first thing I did was redesign the isolation room. I planned it exactly like the one i saw i UK. About the isolation room. In your last case, before you quit, Sherif El-kurdi, What happened? Nothing! Dr Sameh unfortunately came in at the wrong moment. The patient was having a fit, he killed him. And the numbers on the wall? Was it magic? Not at all, doctor. I pretended I was exorcising a demon called Nael from his body. I persuaded him. He believed me and became awake. Very smart, Doctor But let's deal with Farida in the traditional way. Sure. Come, Doctor. Farida. Dr. Yehia Rashid. Please, tell him what happened in the ward. We should have met long ago. Sorry, I don't understand. Do you know me? Lubna. Your wife. She was my friend. For years. But not any more. Farida, How can i help you? What can you tell us about the murder? It was cold. I was buying a mirror for the villa with my mom. I had terrible insomnia. So terrible! Then I fell asleep. I fell asleep. I found myself locked in the room. My hands were soaked in blood. Blood! All over my legs. I opened the door. I followed my footprints. I saw the blood going up to... Up to ... Laila's room. She was, Laila was slaughtered on her bed, It wasn't me! I didn't kill them. I didn't kill them. I didn't kill them. I didn't. I couldn't even kiss them! I couldn't hug them, keep something of theirs, smell their scent. I couldn't... Farida... What you're doing now, we've seen it many times. Now that you;ve killed your cell mate, you're very close to death row. Did you ever ask mom, Doctor, why you don't look like your father? Not even your uncle. I need you, Doctor. It seems you know each other. I don't know her, maybe she's a friend of my wife. She also talks about your family. So, your wife's name is Lubna. Yes. I'll ask her when I'm home. I'll leave you alone with her and I'll watch from the surveillance room. Can we untie her? Do you still love her as you did at first? Why did you ask to meet me? I heard about Sherif El-kurdi's case. Lubna's brother. I said you're the only one who can help me. Lubna was always talking about you, how you were the love of her life. Like Nermine. Your first wife. She used to say that too. How do you know Nermine? Don't drink infront of you daughter, she said it right before the accident. One hundred and sixty! you were driving at 160 km per hour! Why? You punished her for a sin she didn't commit. Because you had lost Lubna. What was her fault? Do you remember... Your daughter's face in the mirror? Or was it the car that couldn't bear your madness. I don't think it's a good idea we are here to play. Seven times! It rolled over seven times! you fell on the asphalt. They went up. The strange thing is: you forgot. You forgot Yehia. Numbers won't help you. Even if they end with 66. 66. Lubna will kill you, Yehia. All of you. She will kill your son, Then her daughter Then you, Then she will kill herself. Don't fall asleep, Yehia! If you close your eyes for a second, you'll regret it forever. Three nights, Yehia. Three nights. Before the fourth night, Everything will be over. Yehia... Yehia are you ok? Are you ok? Stand up. Yasser, Stand up. Do you have high blood pressure, or diabetes? Whould you like a check? There is no need. Farida talked about your children. I don't remember. I'm sorry, Doctor, I don't have an explanation for this. This guy doesn't look ok. I can't trust an addict or a psycho. "Gruesome crime: High society Lady slaughters husband and daughter" Farida Ebeid. I really don't understand. Her case went viral on social media. But it's strange. You never told me you have a friend called Farida Ebeid. I have no time for social media. I'm overwhelmed with work, house and family chores. I used to know her before we got married. We were colleagues at the bank. I just remember that she was conceited. She didn't like anyone, she used to spend ages at the mirror. Oh, and she was jealous of me. Then we had an argument I don't remember why I know why she wanted to meet you. Because she knew it would upset me. -Why would it? -She's not easy. I think you get what i mean. Yehia, we agreed we woudn't dig up this stuff. you promised. Like you promised you would quit alcohol. -We started! -This word upsets me. Ok. Leave your mobile when we're talking. Oh, of course you'll tell me you're tired, upset, annoyed, fed up with everything. I want to sleep. -Hania, go to bed -I'm not sleepy at all. it's early Don't let me take you to bed. I'll tell him a story. Come, come! NIGHT ONE Once upon a time, there was a naughty little boy called Ziyad, Do you know him? -Yes. -Who is he? -Me. -You got it. Anyway, he had a sister called Hania, Whenever she wished to play with him he'd say: no,no. his dad and his mom loved him so much. But he had a problem, Leave the iPad, listen to the story, you're always on the iPad. Everyday she used to wake Ziyad up for school, I don't want to go to school, I'm tired, I'm sick! He went to school unwillingly. He was very smart. -What's wrong, honey? -There's someone under the bed. There's no one under the bed. No, there is someone. If I find him, I'll give him a lesson. Daddy, someone is on the bed. Don't fall asleep, Yehia. I'm not going through this nightmare again. So you've changed your mind. Refusing this case troubles me a lot. And real estate is not my cup of tea. I'm thinking I'll restart my career. Or Farida knows your wife? They fell out, after an argument. Dr. Yehia You know what they say about you in meetings of the Board of Trustees? That you're a charlatan and an alcoholic. But I resolved Sherif El-kurdi's case, Which had confused the whole hospital. Let's get this over without hassle. Nothing will be done without my permission. Sure. -I'm nit sure it's the right decision. -I have no other option. Farida won't speak to anyone else. How are you Farida? Lubna says hi. She wants to see you. You look like you haven't slept I had odd dreams. Can I tell you something? To tell the difference between reality and dreams? Look for clocks. In dreams there are no clocks. Do you know that fish know when humans lie? Because they need care. Love They don't complain. They die unnoticed. Unlike dogs. Farida, Tell me aout the murder in the ward Who! Ah! Her brain was melting away,It was a matter of time and she would die So you killed her. If you don't tell me the truth, I won't be able to mee you again. You haven't yet realized you are a curse for all those who loved you. Your smell, is like my father's smell. My mom also used to say he was the love of her life. LOSS OF CONFIDENCE IN HER FATHER He cheated on her with so many women. And your husband? Did he cheat on you? No He didn't NARCISSISTIC PERSONALITY SYMPTOMS Perhaps he didn't have the chance! The strange thing is, that the man who cheats, has a particular charm. Like you. But I didn't cheat on Lubna. You haven't cheated on her yet. You haven't cheated. The past tense. It means you haven't yet found the one who will change you mind. And how can you be so sure? Although the woman in your home is not Lubna. How come?! If you help me get out of here, I may be able to stop her. I may be able to help you. You don't know Lubna as well as I do. Farida, You can't get out of here if you don't give me answers. Beware of signs, Yehia Time flies. Beware of the lion. Dr Heba, what was the victim's illness? An odd coincidence , a brain tumor that crushed an artery. But the nurse said she was screaming Farida's name. Are you ok? Drink some water. THE GOLDEN LION COMPANY Beware of the lion. God granted you a new life. Get well soon. AL KHANKAH PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL I'm Dr Yehia Rashid, deputy manager. Hello Doctor. The administration told is you lack staff for the night shift. How? We deal with it very well nothing is missing. Let me see the case records, there's a case I need to check. How are you, Sherif? Hi Yehia! Why haven't you come to see me in all this time? I missed you, how are you? I missed you too. Where have you been, Yehia, and how is Lubna? -We're fine. -Why don't you ask about me? I'm sorry, you're right. You know, life is hard. I heard you will get out soon. I'll never get out of here, Yehia. How can I? Are you crazy? Look, it's an ordeal, imposed by God. An ordeal. We shall thank God. Thank God. Thank God. We redeem our sins on earth, to go to Heaven with a clean soul. But why do you say you won't get out of here? Did something happen? Excuse me, I'll do the sunset prayer. I missed you, Yehia. How are you and how is Lubna? I missed you so. Don't fall asleep, Yehia. -Why do you say so, Sherif? -What? "Don't fall asleep, Yehia." I've been awake for twenty days. He wasn't burned, Yehia he wasn't. He comes to me when I sleep, and also when I'm awake. Then he leaves me alone and i feel good. Then he comes back suddenly He comes inside me... He never stops talking about you. And his voice is so loud! Sherif! Who are you talking about? Him. It's him, Yehia he wasn't burned. But don't worry. I finally found how to defeat him. Thank God, I finally found away to defeat him. I wrote... I wrote down everything. I wrote everything, GINK ASARE ENORHT Only one word is missing. Just one word. Which word? I can't see it. But you're clever. You're a foreseer. You'll know how to find it. you must! You must finish the story to understand it. -There's only one word missing. -Sherif! Only one word. Sherif! Doctor!Help! How is he, Doctor? He bit off a chunk of his tongue. But the hemorrhage stopped. Did he have an epileptic fit? Not at all. He was talking normally and then... Sadly, I don't think he will be ever able to talk again Don't fall asleep, Yehia. Three nights. GINK ASARE ENORHT Beware of the signs, Yehia -Joe! -Hi, doc, how are you? Where have you been? What happened? -An accident -Shall i get you some medical spirits? -What do you want to drink? -A Jack Daniel's and a stimulant. A Stimulant? You'll waste your day. Is this child's drink is enough for you, or shall I get you some grown up stuff from Escobar? What is it doc? Sahll get you a balloon? I forgot the trunk, Sorry. The Blue Elephant? Oh, Ok. Follow me. Ok. Wait a second. There's a camera in the toilet. Have fun in the garage. I had totally different plans. What? -Who do you think I am? -A cop. Do I look like a cop? No one asks for the Blue elepant so smooth. 1000 Pounds. I want three. 1000 each. Yes, The inflation. But i don't have enough cash. I'm impressed. No more than one per day. There's a double dose of DMT in each, your body can't take more than one. I don't like sudden visists. There's my number on the bill. Text me next time. Listen, Who did the tatto on your back? -An artist called... -Deega? Deega. Where is she now? 12,TALAAT HARB ST. LOTUS GUEST HOUSE GINK ASARE ENORHT You look so cool when you're dead, Doc. GINK ASARE ENORHT Sweetheart. Yehia, isn't Bugsy with you? Come. We found some insects on him, so we took him to the vet. What happened to your hand? I stumbled Why are you sleeping here? Mommy woke us up for a shower. At this time? Lubna. What are you doing? What are you doing? Lubna. I don't want his schoolmates to call him a sissy. No one will make fun of him. Can you give me the scissors? The scissors. NIGHT TWO. Once upon a time, There was a mom who loved her son so much. Her name was Lubna, her sone was Ziyad. She wanted him to be the most handsome in the world Handsome, well dressed. Well groomed. She used to cut his hair all the time. Because she loved him. But he was afraid. Although he was already a too big to be afraid And he knew his mom loved him more than anyone else. You're hungry, aren't you? What are you doing? Cutting that hair that sticks out from your eyebrow. Now you look better. What happened in the bathroom with Ziyad? His schoolmates make fun of him. -Where are you going? -I'm having breakfast with a friend. We missed the school bus take the kifs out. Dressed up like this for a breakfast? Are you jealous? I don't even rememeber the last time you were Lubna, You have the symptoms of borderline personality disorder. Frequent mood swings. Treat me as insane, now that you're back at the madhouse. You like Farida, don't you? So you know, women can feel it when a man's unhappy with his wife. She must have noticed that you don't wear your wedding ring. I don't weat it because it irritates my fingers. Do you remember the last time you touched me? The last time you wanted? You'er bored, Yehia amd you started drinking again. And drinking is not fun without some hot company. Or maybe you'll kill us all in a car crash, as you did to your first family. Smash things, get drunk. Kill me like you killed her. You said she was insaine, but it's you who dragged her into depression. You are never satisfied, Yehia. Even your old love doesn't fulfill you. You're bored with your life, your home Even death couldn't change you -Hello -Yes sir. -Is this villa for sale? -No, the owners haven't put it on sale. Haven't they? And the dog? Who are you? Mansour! Calm down, Madam, and put the knife away. Who let him in? Talk! I don't know, Madam, he must have come while I was changing the gas tank. Please. I'm Dr yehia Rashed, from Abbaseya hospital. Wait for me downstairs. My daughter, Farida didn't kill, Doctor. Mrs. Naglaa, I'm here to help Farida. Lubna El-Kurdi, What do you know about her? She hated her. Because she was the nicest girl in their group She nicked one of their colleagues. at the bank and married him After she badmouthed her, said she was conceited and insane. She stole him! I raised Farida up... like a princess. They felt envy toward her. They dove her crazy She used to spend days locked in her room. God help you, Madam Naglaa I won't bother you any more with this. I just need you to tell the porter to let me in, if I come. Maybe, I'll find some useful clue to the case. Excuse me. I told you, you'd change your mind. It was nice what happened yesterday between us. I wish we could finish. How is Lubna? It's you who should say. Do you like dancing, Yehia? Your body language says so. Your eyes widened. Your saliva flows. You are hungry. Aren't you? And then, I'm nicer than Lubna. All women now are nicer than Lubna, right? I promise you, When i get out of here, I'll take good care of you. Before the accident, you locked yourself in a room for hours. Why? Mom has a big mouth. So what? I just needed some time alone. To do some pedicure and manicure. I was so bored, Yehia. so much I went to your house. I saw your pictures and met your mom. it couldn't be you who did it. I didn't kill them. I didn't kill them. I want to talk to Fraida. I want to talk to Fraida. Sure. I will leave you both alone. Farida! Go out... Go out! What have you done? How dare you go through the glass? I needed to get close to her. She's fighting against something inside her, I'm getting to know it. What are you saying? You! What drugs are you on? I didn't do it. I didn't do it. In our first session she told me to beware of the lion. The same day I crashed into a truck with a lion painted on it. Today she said my son, Hania and me will die, then Lubna will kill herself. And you believed her as you did with Sherif El-Kurdi. I saw Sherif bite off his tongue, He was going to say something. Dr Akram, if you check the archive you'll find many unresolved cases. Farida foresees events. She's not a normal patient. You need a doctor, Doctor. What's wrong, Lubna? What's wrong? Where's Ziyad? Where's Ziyad? Did you ever ask your mom, doctor why you don't look like your father? Not even your uncle. if you check the archive you'll find many unresolved cases. I don't remember anything. I really don't know how I didn't notice he went to the toilet alone. Google said who was drowned, could get something called late drown. He would wake up then get tired then he will die. Sweetheart, tomorrow Ziyad will be just fine. Let's say hi to you dad! come on honey. I'm sorry for Ziyad, I hope he gets well soon. I came to take Hania to spend the night with me, since the situation is hard. Come on, honey! I don't want to leave Ziyad. Mommy doesn't like it when I go home with him. Hania, you're big and this is your dad. And we'll have to leave soon, to get clothes for Ziyad. Go with your daddy just for tonight and come back tomorrow. Mommy isn't happy when I go with him, Does she talk like this with Hania! Never mind. You know how much Lubna cares for Hania. Really? She used to leave her with the maid for the whole day! She almost killed her when she attempted suicide. Didn't... she tell you? I'm sorry! she put 20 sleeping pills in Hania's milk. Sorry, Khaled, did you have an affair with Farida Ebeid, before Lubna? They were fighting over me. But if I could go back then, I'd have chosen Farida. She's surely easier than Lubna. Excuse me. Let's go honey. Why didn't you tell me you put 20 sleeping pills in Hania's milk? I was out of my mind. When I came to my senses, I couldn't remember anything. And you don't remember your fight with Farida over Khaled? When we broke up and i was dying for you. Forget it! Suicidal thoughts are symptoms of depression. But forgetting you almost killed your daughter is much more serious. Borderline disorder make you forget. Karima Zakariya Sulayman 1932. Narcissistic personality disorder. She used to think in a strange language. She killed her daughter. Zaynab Gharib 1945, She killed her child and walked free after treatment. Badreya Nosseir 19996, a paranoiac that killed her daughter. He killed his wife saying she was "possessed" Sherif El-Kurdi, killed his wife saying he was "possessed" Yehia is right. NIGHT THREE Your Highness, the Prince, Your Highness, the Princess, Crown Prince I present the mirror of the Red King The king of the Kings of Demons. I was inherited by a dynasty of demons. until the wise Sulayman recieved it. He made that frame for it. And he appointed a guardian who sees the unseen from one thousand leagues. Years passed and it ended up with us, The Kings of the Gipsies! I present you.. My wife! Lolya! The gipsy fortune-teller. Don't be afraid, But be careful! Because my mirror doesn't reflect reality. It reflects the original meaning! you will live long. you'll have nine grandchildren. The seventh of whom will be important. Fulfilled happiness. A life spent in a green Northen land. you were born lucky. You've lived a happy life. But it won't last. Your kingdom will end. And you will die. Alone. In the near future, you will have the kingdoms of the East and the West. your son, after a long life will become the King of the Kings. I'll build you a statue with my hands. So you won't forget Lolya. I missed you! Where's Dr. Yehia? Restoril, a truth serum. I need to trust you on that condition I'll let you see Yehia. Do you know this woman? And this? And this? They all said the same: they killed while they were "possessed" The last was Sherif El-Kurdi. Who are they? I don't know them. Anyway! Did you ask you mom why you don't look like you dad, or not yet? Your reprot will be written. "A fully aware murderer of her own child" You will be excuted. If someone inside you wants to talk let her come out, please. Unfortunately she left, just one minute ago. The number you are calling is not available. -Get me Farid's report, I'll update it -yes, sir Yehia your theory is right. We have to meet. I'll wait for you at the hospital. -Let Yehia read this when he comes. -Alright I'll be waiting for him. It's the third time I brought you food and it comes back untouched. You quit eating? Sorry, she's just fallen asleep. Shall I get you something from the cafeteria? What happened? Farida disappeared. The light went off. When the cameras came back on, We couldn't find her. But we found... He told me he wanted to see me. What for? A few minutes before dying He left you case dossiers I searched the archive for the doctors who followed similar cases. What I saw terrified me. All of them! All of them with no exception! were victims of accidents. Terrible accidents. If they didn't die, Their whole families died. At first, I didn't believe you. But after what happened... Mrs. Deega, please. Are you still drawing that tattoo? Have a little rest. I'll keep drawing it. Because of you. Because one day you forced me to tell you its secret. But i burned it 5 years ago. No fire can be burned, Doctor. We can exorcise them, but not kill them. If they're normal demons. The one you met five years ago is not a guardian spirit. Nor Sherif's ghost. No one knows how to excorcise it. And no one survives him. He has no laws. He can come in any shape, even that of your nearest and dearest. Unfortunately you'll know it only when it's too late. It's your fault. You're the reason for this curse. I'm just a reason. With or without me, he'll achieve whatever he wants. Do you think, he needs a tattoo to appear? This tattoo is a sign for you. To let you know that you'er just his slave. "Gink Esare Enorht" It has a meaning? Or not. -Why did you appear... -In your visions? Didn't you wonder why you let Lubna slip out of your hands? The end will be amazing. But it will hurt. Dr. Yehia, we called you many times, your phone wasn't available. -Something happened to Ziyad? -No, he's fine, But! It's Hania who fell sick. The doctor said it's a coma due to shock. We gave her a transfusion. She lost a lot of blood. The painkiller will keep her calm, but she needs a psychiatrist. I'm a psychiatrist. Suicide is not an easy thing. How could you let her go so far? Anyhow, she'll wake up within hours. I don't know what to say. Get some sleep. I'm sure my old madness is returning This time I will be the reason for losing you all. I will do the only right thing, Yehia Maybe after that, you will be able to live the life that you wish for. You are the life that I wish for. you promised to withstand my madness. Don't leave me. I don't want to be alone. Lubna! You used my money to make youself beautiful for another man. You swore to me one day that I was the only lover you were faithful to. Hou could I miss your lie? You never loved me. My daughter... Your daughter will grow old, kowing the truth about her mother. The gipsy fortune-teller. Who one day became the whore of the gipsies! My daughter! My daughter! Have mercy! Have mercy! You will die every day. A slow death. I will live with the fairest woman after you. you freed me from the illusion of your love. Forever! Are you the mirror guardian? You will die. But I can help you. I own nothing! No, you do. A soul bring you back to life You will kill your daughter. You will live forever in return for your sacrifies. In an eternal body. With blood you will be immortal. I will be your Lord, your pleasure and your body Get rid of your mortal body. What's your name? NAEL. How didn't I notice? How did I fall in the sin? The gipsie is a fourtune-teller she is a cheater and she is cursed. She killed her husband, her daughter and she killed herself. But her magic can affect you and your descendants. And will destroy your kingdom. We have to put this seal on your door. To protect you and your son. A seal reverse her curse. And I have ordered the gipsies to leave our lands forever GINK ASARE ENORHT NOMED And we send the devil far away from our lands. But he will transfer through bodies, through years The only way to kill him Is to know the secret of the words. GINK ASARE ENORHT NOMED Calm down Sir, it will flow soon. Be patient. Calm down, you had a heart attack in the street and good people called us -Since when am I here? -Nothing, 5 minutes. -Stop the car -What? -What are you doing? -Stop the car. GINK ASARE ENORHT NOMED I missed you, Yehia. GINK ASARE ENORHT NOMED Why? Are you sure you want me to leave? You will miss a lot. Life inside Farid'a body has a special pleasure Big Pleasure. I didn't have it since a long time. Do you want to dance? Why me? Why you! Because I like the challenge. I like who is similar to me. Don't you notice that I'm here! Inside. But I never thought of hurting Lubna. I never thought of hurting Lubna! You already did hurt Lubna, Yehia. You ended the love story you were telling. And for that! I have a generous offer for you. Very generous. Don't be afraid I will not ask you for your soul as the movies. Yehia, I'm here to help. What is the offer? All the legendary love stories that we hear about ended with tragedy. Romeo and Juliet, Shamshoun and Dalila, Yehya and Lubna. Eternity comes only with death. I can change all that! End your love story, But with separation. Shall I leave Lubna! Yes, If you love her. Let her find a man who sees her as a woman not a mother. Or she will die! She and your children. Yehia needs a new woman in his life. A woman never bores him. I can be that woman. I can Kneel down under your legs everyday. In reward, and please without resistance. You will accept that we'll be neighbours. Neighbours in the same body. Help me Farida. My name is NAEL. The third night is ending, Yehia. In minutes your children will die. Don't be afraid. My mirror doesn't reflect reality. But it reverse the truth. A seal reverse her curse.
