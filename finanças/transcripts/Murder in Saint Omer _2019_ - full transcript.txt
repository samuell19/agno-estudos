What's wrong? I heard a car. So? Someone's outside. You're scaring me. Lock the door and go upstairs. If there's trouble, call the police. What trouble? Do as I said! Listen to me. Lock yourself inside. Daniel. BEDROOM National Police, go ahead. Doulac: 3,021 inhabitants, including three pathetic cowards, profiteers, and crooks who have known for four years that a monster lives among us, one who assassinated Bénédicte Dubois and mutilated Olivia Sysman. If these bastards don't talk, I'll reveal a name per day. I'll reveal their scams and name the murderer. Can you feel it? Does it hurt? Barely. You barely feel it, or it barely hurts? It's Lisa. -Hi, Lisa. -Hi. Hello, Olivia. Hello, Lisa. You look worried. -Haven't you heard? -Heard what? Daniel Chastagnet was taken this morning. From his home. I didn't go to the pharmacy. I don't have your meds. I forgot. Shit, how could I forget? Don't worry, I have some left. Amélie will go. No, it's my fault. I'll come back this evening. Around 7:00, 7:15 p.m.? Did you know the victim? I know everyone in Doulac. See you later. Chastagnet works at the school, and his wife works in the canteen. Kidnapped, Chastagnet. He's not a child. I don't get it. DOULAC: 3,021 INHABITANTS... IF THESE BASTARDS DON'T TALK, I'LL REVEAL A NAME PER DAY. ...AND NAME THE MURDERER. -Over here, Chief Inspector! -Coming. Careful, it's slippery. Morning, Dumas, any news? We're done, Chief Inspector. We only found the gun. Two shots were fired. We don't know if he was injured, or if he hit his attacker. Neighbors? One saw a white car around 6:30 a.m. Another saw the car too. Both heard shots. -Is Mrs. Chastagnet here? -She's inside. Who's that? I don't know, Chief Inspector. Right. I'm Chief Inspector Laure Martinez. I just arrived from Saint-Omer. Would you like a coffee? No, thank you. I won't keep you. I know you're worried. You told the officers that your husband was nervous. When did you first notice that? This morning. We get up together. We work at the school. Everything was fine, then he started getting stressed. He was edgy and uneasy. What time was it? It was 6:00 a.m., 6:30. Did he get a phone call or any messages? No. He was right beside me at breakfast. I would've heard. It could've been a message. Daniel goes online when he wakes up. Do you know his password? No. There's nothing else you can tell me that might help me? Maybe... money troubles, a recent altercation, problems with the neighbors? Nothing at all. That's what I told the officers. Since we started working at the school, it has all been fine. No issues. I'll go over your statement. I might need to call you. Let me know if anything comes to mind. We'll do everything we can to find him. Thank you. Let me know once you've spoken to the neighbors. -What's your name? -Cibersky, Chief Inspector. Hello. Why were you at Chastagnet's house? I'm Thomas Aubert. I judged the Dubois case. Do you remember it? More or less. Mr. Chastagnet is missing, isn't he? I think the two are linked. Who sent you? The DA? For a kidnapping? I came of my own accord. On what basis do you think the cases are linked? The anonymous message. I imagine you're aware. Vaguely. Someone thought it'd be fun to send e-mails to the inhabitants. I think Chastagnet is one of the people in the message. This isn't your case. There's nothing for you here. I drove 200 miles to talk to you. Give me five minutes. I think Chastagnet is dead, the first on a list. -A list? An anonymous letter writer? -Yeah. Sorry, I'm not interested. Dumas, can you show this gentleman out? It is not just a trivial message. The author is informed. -More people will die, understand? -Fine. I believe you. I'll read it. Thanks for your help. They've sent her three times, and every time, we think the same as you: she's a rough one. Warrant Officer Dumas. Hello. Follow me, Your Honor. I was there in 2014. I didn't recognize you at the house. -Are you staying for long? -Given the welcome, no. All the hotels are full anyway. Because of the music festival. It starts in a few days, and the musicians are already here. I can give you an address. A guesthouse. Very peaceful. Olivia Sysman. The great Swiss pianist. Know her? Yeah. She was hit by a car two days after Bénédicte Dubois's murder. -Did you find the driver? -No. But God knows we looked. Thank you, Officer. -Your Honor? -Yes. Many people got the message. They're linking it to Chastagnet. She should listen, because I agree with you. The killer reacted to the message. If they aren't caught, more will die. Here's my number, just in case. -Hi. -Hi. The mayor is here. He's with the festival volunteers. OK, thanks. Hi, Martine. Is it really a kidnapping? Chastagnet heard a noise and left with his gun. His wife heard shots. He vanished into thin air. There's a link with that message, I'm sure of it. Did you ask them? Did anyone else get the message? Everyone got it, Vincent. No exceptions. What the hell is this? I don't know. I don't like it. I have to get back. Avoid a mass panic just before the festival. It'd be a disaster. We have a lot riding on this. Why don't you go see if she's OK? Three people knew Bénédicte's killer and didn't say anything. Sandra, that's nonsense. Total nonsense. Did the killer knock Olivia Sysman down too? Who knows? I don't. Why would I? Look, the new festival poster. -Wow. -It's great, right? Good job! Yes, the rooms are available, but I'm tired. I want to be alone. I think that's him. See you later. Hello. I was told you had guest rooms to rent. Not right now. Are you a musician? No. No, Amélie, he's untrustworthy. This man implicated me in a criminal case without even questioning me. I tried several times, Ms. Sysman. You were unavailable. I was in pieces. I needed repairing. Then you left. They took me off the case. That's not true. I checked. You put your personal interests first. Your career. Who told you that? -Who is this? -Don't you recognize him? He's Judge Aubert, who was in charge of the Dubois case. Before he ran away. The Dubois case and, incidentally, my accident. Your successor dismissed the case last week. I heard. Sorry for bothering you. We'll never know who killed Bénédicte. I'm not so sure. Why is he back? He got the message. He's not from here. Why'd he receive it? I think we found Daniel Chastagnet. Where? By the canal locks. Kids were doing graffiti. Is he alive? They found an unconscious man. They got scared and called us. I told them to leave the area. Good, let's go. This is what we used before the big locks. It's slippery. It's for lifting barges. A system of communicating vessels. It goes up and down. I know how it works, Officer. -When was it abandoned? -In the '70s. But they did some renovations to save the building. We need to confirm it's Chastagnet. Yes, Chief Inspector. It's Daniel. Call the Saint-Omer coroner. I want him here. I need officers to secure a perimeter. And light, lots of light. OK, thanks, Franck. I called the mayor. He's a friend. He'll find you a room. Come back this afternoon. Thank you. Yes? This is Warrant Officer Dumas. Chief Inspector Martinez would like to see you. You found the body. Yes, and Chastagnet was murdered. Are you available? I'm at the Lombardo restaurant. I'll pick you up. I should tell you. Olivia Sysman called. She'll rent you a room. I imagine that's thanks to you. I want you to stay in Doulac and help us. I saw you working four years ago. You go out in the field. Not everybody likes it. Tell me about Chastagnet. Daniel? He was born and raised here. He worked at the school. He volunteered at the festival. Nothing out of the ordinary. Does that help? I'm not sure yet. Right, tell me everything. What's the link with this murder and Bénédicte Dubois? I read the judge's dismissal. According to your successor, it was a break-in gone wrong. Forget that. This homicide proves the contrary. Four years ago, what made you believe it was an assassination rather than a burglary? A painting. A Utrillo was hanging on the wall a few feet from the body. But the suspected gang specialized in stealing art. They would never have thought it was a copy. The murderer's mistake. Do you have a suspect in mind? I didn't get the time to dig deeper, Chief Inspector. In other words, you've got nothing. I have a theory. I think the anonymous letter writer hated that the case got dismissed. They wanted to spook the murderer. That appears to have worked, right? What's the cause of death? The coroner suspects a heart attack. Chastagnet was... He was slashed about 20 times. You are faced with a determined and dangerous man. He killed Bénédicte and thought the case was closed. But now he's scared. So he'll target the remaining witnesses. Catch him quickly, because he'll start again. Amélie is in town. The bedrooms are upstairs. I won't show you the way. Pick whichever one you want. Amélie will explain breakfast to you. Thanks for changing your mind. I haven't changed my mind about you. Officer Dumas asked for a favor. I can't say no to favors. Thanks anyway. He said that they found Chastagnet's body. Yes. It is a homicide. What will you do? I don't know. I'm meeting with some officers later. Then I'll be on my way. It's only for one night. Don't worry. Thank you. Do you feel better? No. Hi, Thierry. Did you get the info? Yes, I traced the e-mail, but I can't identify the sender. Why not? It was sent from one of the two free Wi-Fi spots provided by the council. OK, thanks. I'll call you. Aren't you worried about the e-mail's revelations? Why should I be worried? It mentions crooks and profiteers. Imagine if we're named. You, the mayor, and me, the lawyer's son, aren't crooks. Are you a crook, Franck? Are you hiding something? No, what are you talking about? I'm talking about the rumors, what people will say. "We" as in those with nothing to hide who might be wrongly accused. -Good evening. -Good evening. One second. Take him as an example. Someone might tell the taxman he only declares half his earnings. Lombardo? You must be kidding. He's scared of his own shadow. But he'd have to prove his innocence. The anonymous messages are poisonous, Jean-Marie. Pure poison. Who is this jerk who's messing with us? No idea. We must catch them and quickly. What's up with him? He's scared. My nurse was expected at 7:00 p.m. Lisa is never late. She's not answering my calls. I'm worried. I'm going to the station. I'll inform them, OK? Do you have my number? What would I do with your number? A man was killed nearby, and you're named in the e-mail. Here. I wonder why you got the anonymous message. I wonder why you came back after your accident. You could have stayed in Geneva. To prepare my retaliation. To get revenge on Doulac, including the driver. I wrote that message. Be careful what you say. It could be used against you. Forget I mentioned it. I'll leave my number. Why bother? You're leaving tomorrow. We got into Daniel Chastagnet's inbox. He got the anonymous message and read it at 5:45 a.m. He was unsettled and didn't tell his wife. He knew the murderer, Officer. That's why he was tortured. The killer made sure that he wouldn't talk. You need to go digging in Chastagnet's past. His contacts, any schemes or scams... I spoke to the DA. He wants you on the case. Why did you tell him about me? Isn't that what you wanted? Absolutely not. This case sent me to rot in a closet for four years. You're not here for the festival. You came to finish the work you started four years ago. You couldn't bear being taken off the case. I came because I was worried about that message. Period. I'm worried about the psychopath killer. Did you see what he did? Any news from the coroner? He confirms that Daniel died from a heart attack at around 8:00 a.m. -Nothing from his phone? -Nothing. And the neighbors... What about the car? Out of the two who saw a vehicle after the shots, one of them mentions a white-gray van, and the other, an off-white pick-up. That doesn't help much. Where were you before you left? I was only on it for a few months. But I quickly saw that Mrs. Dubois ruffled the locals' feathers. A dynamic and ambitious woman who wanted to change certain habits. She took over her husband's business after he died from a heart attack. Construction and civil engineering, delivering fuel... If I had been kept on, I'd have looked at who might feel threatened. As for Olivia Sysman, an accident is hard to believe. She was close to Mrs. Dubois and often stayed with her in Doulac. I think she knew something that threatened the killer. -Did you question her? -No. After a coma, she had many operations. I couldn't interview her. What about you? Several times. But the judge who took over didn't look into any link. I think he was right. It's speculation. Do you have proof? You need proof, witnesses linking the two cases. I'm here for the Chastagnet case, not the Dubois one. -You want proof? -Yes. Find the remaining two people. Question them and protect them. Officer, Olivia's nurse didn't show up and isn't answering her phone. -Could you pass by? -It's on my way home. I'll stop by. Thank you. LETTER WRITER? Go ahead, I'm not tired. I'll listen to music until he gets back. Why did you give him a room? You said he was a jerk. It's a favor for Officer Dumas, that's all. You like him. He likes you in any case. The way he looks at you! Nonsense. I certainly don't need a man in my life. What? Someone's outside. You're seeing things. I saw a shadow, I'm sure. Amélie, don't go out there. Don't go out there! If it's nothing, I'll be fine. Unbelievable. Come back! May I? Certainly. I heard that you got a room. Yes. I knew I recognized you. You're Judge Aubert. I hope you find the sender, before they cause too much damage. You fear them more than the killer? I listen to people. People are worried about being wrongly accused. Oh, do you have anything to hide? So much that it's hard to keep track. But nothing to deserve death or being thrown to the mob. Not the case for some. If you know anything, now's the time. Before they send another message. Nothing? Fine. Check, please. If I were you, I'd talk to the mayor. The mayor... I thought he was your friend. We're all friends here. But why him? The marshes attract the tourists and the festival too. Doulac is going places. It's a sweet gig. Bénédicte Dubois wanted the position. Good evening. How much is it? 22.50. Have you eaten? Yes, in town. Any news from your nurse? I asked Officer Dumas to check on her. He would've called. Thank you. You're welcome. Amélie can serve breakfast starting from 7:00 a.m. I went to the hospital, you know. First in Lille, just after your accident. Then Geneva, a few months later. I was refused every time. You weren't ready. I had nothing to tell you. Nothing. I didn't abandon you, Olivia. You did something worse. You turned my accident into an attempted murder. You think I needed that? My life would have been shattered just for knowing Bénédicte. A renowned musician, I would've become collateral damage. I'm sorry. Great, that's a real help. Now, this letter writer has picked up on it, and I'm involved in this murder. My name is in the message. It's surreal. I have nothing to do with any of this. I know. Go ahead. It's Dumas. Sorry to wake you, but I've made a serious mistake. Meaning? When I passed by the nurse's place, I saw her car and the lights were on. All seemed fine, so I kept driving. On my way to the station, nothing had changed. The lights were on. I pulled over, and the door was open. -I think they took her. -Touch nothing. I'm coming. Officer. Lisa wouldn't have left without her ID and telephone. -Is that her car? -Yes, she only travels by car. She was eating. The bell rang, she answered and was taken. What makes you say that? Come and see. -Have you told Martinez? -I left her a message. She left for Saint-Omer last night. I think she's getting a divorce. What are the cops doing here? Lisa didn't open up this morning. The cops are at her place too. Chastagnet yesterday, Lisa today. People are scared, Vincent. They think the letter writer won't stop. The sender should just name them. They're dreaming if they think people will hand themselves in. See you at the meeting. Chief Inspector. Call for backup, a canine unit, and search the marshes. I spoke to the DA this morning. I agreed to take the case. The marshes are a maze, over 100 miles of canals. Precisely. A good place to hide or to hide someone else. I'll make the call. Good. Officer, do you have a detailed map of the marshes? I'll get one from City Hall. City Hall? I'll handle that. Focus on the missing nurse. Neighbors, her phone, credit cards. Question her most recent patients. Keep me posted. Colonel Laurent, please. When you question the neighbors... I heard Lisa was taken too. Yes. How did she seem yesterday? Did she know about Chastagnet? Yes, she mentioned it. Lisa wasn't her usual self. Meaning? She came to deliver painkillers, but she forgot them. You still feel pain? From the rehab exercises. Did you speak about Bénédicte's murder with Lisa? You're obsessed. To you, everyone is linked to that case. I'm obsessed with finding the truth. Yesterday, Chastagnet was taken and mutilated. Now, your nurse is missing. I want to find her and find her alive, if possible. -I thought you were leaving. -Not anymore. -I can free up the room, if you like. -No. We often spoke about the murder. The slow legal process. Lisa and Bénédicte were childhood friends. You're saying she fits the profile of the letter writer? The whole of Doulac could have written that message. I understand. It could have been me. That's the second time you've implied it. I hope it isn't true. Why? It's helping to get to the truth. Maybe. And an accessory to murder. You know that the mayor was an MP. He has friends in high places. You still want to question him? Officially, we're here for a map of the marshes. The restaurant owner, his deputy mayor, points a finger. It's shooting themselves in the foot. They're nervous. Let's not complain; it saves us time. We'll get you a map and bring it to the police station. Do you think Lisa Moreau-- It's too early to say. What do you think about the message? Nothing. I have little regard for anonymous critics. Did you know Mrs. Dubois? That case has been dismissed. You're investigating Chastagnet's death. Answer the question. Unbelievable. One dead, one missing, and he wants to discuss a cold case! Where were you yesterday between 6:00 and 9:00 a.m.? -Am I a suspect? -It's an investigation. I've asked everyone the same question since yesterday. I had an important meeting about the nature reserve. At 6:00 a.m.? At 7:00 a.m. I'm very busy. I start early. Between being the mayor, private life and the festival, I don't stop. Where was this meeting? With whom? Unbelievable. At home with Sandra Duclot, the nature reserve manager. And yesterday, around 8:00 p.m.? I ate dinner alone. So no alibi. Are you gonna arrest me? Any further questions? No, just the same one. What was your relationship to Mrs. Dubois? A professional one. She managed a construction company. We met to discuss viability and pre-emption rights. I was doing my job as the mayor. Seeing as you brought it up, I heard she wanted to run against you in the elections? Check your sources. You think we'd kill each other for a mayor's salary? If the salary is so poor, why did you stand for election? You know the way out. Thank you, sir. Until next time. It's me. Look who's back. The police will question you. I need you to say that you were with me at 7:00 a.m. to discuss the nature reserve. At 7:00 a.m.? I was with my husband. I can't lie. Just confirm it. They won't involve your husband. Why me? Where were you? I was at home alone, since you don't come anymore. Why do you need an alibi? Nobody can confirm that I was home alone. I understand. Well? Dumas confirmed Lisa Moreau's movements. She started at 7:00 a.m. Her last patient was Jeanne Canova. Let's go see her. He counts 292 recipients of the anonymous message. A mass e-mail group. Compare the recipients with other files, the library, etc., and with the nurse's patients. Chief Inspector, thank you for supporting me back there. It was bold to ask for an alibi. It's normal. You're the judge. You have your suspicions. I'm leading the investigation, so I ask the right questions. I loved it. Lisa was unsettled. She's so wholesome. She's like an open book, so innocent. Did she know Mr. Chastagnet? Yes, since elementary school. They were both in my class. I was their teacher. I taught in Doulac for nearly 40 years. Was she friends with Bénédicte Dubois? Bénédicte and Lisa were inseparable. They sat next to each other until 5th grade. So you know people around here well. What if I said that I suspected Lisa Moreau of writing that message? I'd say well done. I think it was Lisa. Why do you think that? She never stops thinking about it, and then she acts! She's like you, Your Honor, intent on justice. As a kid, she'd get in any fight. Tell me something. What made you suspect her? Why do you think Lisa is the anonymous letter writer? I think the sender describes three men when they write: "Three pathetic cowards and crooks." So why would Lisa get taken? Because she sent it. Exactly. Thank you. We won't bother you much longer. Find her. I don't want anything to happen to her. She doesn't deserve it, truly. Goodbye, ma'am. Thank you. Let's say the nurse wrote that message. She didn't expect Chastagnet to be kidnapped, and she can't hide her nervousness. Everyone noticed. She panics and leaves here at 6:45 p.m. When the murder is announced, she believes she is next. She goes home and eats dinner before leaving the area. He takes her and leaves the lights on. It holds up. Yes. If it is her, she doesn't stand a chance. We must find this madman. Backup arrives tomorrow. You'll guide them in the marshes. A white pick-up was seen Lisa Moreau's house around 8:00 p.m. The witness didn't see the brand. For now, it's our only lead. Find it. We've searched Lisa's computers and her phone as well. If she's the sender, she used another device. Cibersky, what about her patient list? Every patient received it. OK. Nothing new for Chastagnet? Nothing at the school or with his family. I forgot that he worked for Dubois for a year. It goes back to 2008. Bénédicte's husband was still alive. It's another message. "Jérôme Vidal is one of the bastards who could name the murderer. "He received land in exchange for his silence..." Does anyone know Jérôme Vidal? I'll look into it. They mention a thief. Thieves. Plural. They talk about Chastagnet's death. It isn't a preprogramed message. Lisa Moreau can't be the sender as she was taken. I thought you were right about Lisa Moreau. Who is sending these damned messages? We need to find Vidal and question him. He's a salesman from Saint-Omer. I only have an address. The number is invalid. Are we going? No, I'll go. I have to go to Saint-Omer tonight. I'll stop by and call from there. All right. Send the police there immediately. I'm calling them. I need you to find the link between Chastagnet, Vidal and Moreau. A secret linking them to the murderer. Find it. Yes, I'll get right on it. Thank you. Good evening. Yes, Chief Inspector. I spoke to Mrs. Vidal. Her husband left for Belgium yesterday. We left a message but no answer. He switches his phone off at night. Everything is fine. He sent a text at around 8:00 p.m. from the hotel. Is she aware of the e-mails? No, not at all. The land mentioned is just a fishing hut. I left Vidal a message to contact us urgently. OK. -See you tomorrow. -Bye. How was it? It was... pitiful. Thank you. I played for seven years. Seven years, for that? I admit it wasn't great, but if the piano were in tune, it might have been better. It misses you. Would you like a drink? You're insane. Yes, apparently so. That's what they say about me. What are you up to? Nothing, Olivia. At least not with you. Here's to finally meeting you. Cheers. To us. Isn't it insensitive to be drinking champagne? Just another way to let off steam. What did you do to get pulled from the Dubois case so quickly? Did you play the piano? No. I had a disagreement with the DA. Oh, these things happen. In all walks of life. But I kind of hit him. Did you read the second message? Of course. I don't know any Jérôme Vidal. You know that you and I need to discuss 2014, despite the painful memories it might bring up. I see. You organized a champagne reception. Where did you think this would get you? To you. You have absolutely no chance with me. None. I've drawn a line. Under what? All men? Maybe you haven't noticed, but I'm in a wheelchair. So what? I was engaged. We tried to have a baby. He couldn't touch me anymore. What are you saying? Seriously? I was trapped in a bed for almost four months. I had seven operations. My legs are shot, completely dead. I had to stop playing piano. Music was my whole life. We all have... had to face tragedy in our lives. But we pick ourselves up and learn to live with it. Oh, yeah? What is your little tragedy, Your Honor? A fight with the DA? Being brushed aside? What is it? My wife and son died in a car accident. All lost in a split second. Yes. Same situation for the second message, but it wasn't sent from the same Wi-Fi hotspot. The sender moved? Yes. The first was sent from the south end of town; the second, from a point in the north. OK. I'll send you a map. -Thanks. -Ciao. -Morning. -I'd like to talk. I'm expected at the station, but I'll call you this afternoon. Perfect. See you later. This is the point the first message was sent from, not far from the nurse's home. This is where the second message was sent from, last night. At the marina. On the opposite side of town. Watch both locations. It feels like we're treading water. There are always moments like this. Any news from Vidal? No. Nor his wife. I informed the Belgian police who are searching around Namur. I'll coordinate the search. Are you coming with me? I have an idea I need to look into. An idea? A hunch that could lead us to the killer. If it's a hunch... Thank you. How would Lisa know the names of the three people she mentions? Lisa is the only nurse around here. She talks to everyone. She knows all the gossip and rumors. She's the best-informed person in Doulac. But for four years, since Bénédicte Dubois's murder, I think she has led her own investigation. Oh really? -Here. -No, thank you. Why have you come to see me? I need help. Help from an old woman who can't see very well? From Doulac's memory. If I told you about a student whose bad grades frustrated their parents, as they had real potential... An aggressive, violent student. Who would you think of? Myself. I was a rebellious student. And I became a devoted teacher. It means nothing. It's the profile of a man who is now a killer. Not a struggling student who turned things around. I can talk about difficult students but don't ask me to accuse people. I won't ask you to do my job, just to help me narrow the field. Lives are at stake. Well, I can... I can talk about a group of boys. Difficult students. They fought, didn't do much work, and they had potential. Some have done well for themselves. The mayor, for example. He was an MP. Franck Ferrer, yes. Who else? The little Jourdain boy... Yes, Jean-Marie Jourdain, the lawyer's son. Vincent Lombardo owns the restaurant. He was a sneaky one. Daniel Chastagnet? No, he was as sweet as anything. The last one... Bénédicte Dubois. You said boys. Yes, I did... and tomboys. Hi, Olivia. He's trying to get into the house. Who is? I don't know. Whoever you want it to be. I'll call the police. I'm coming. Tell him they're on their way. I'm coming. I called the police. They are on their way! Were you here? No. He must have waited until I went into town. How are you? Getting there. Can you describe him? No, he was too far away. I saw a shadow behind the door. He was dressed in black and wearing a ski mask, at least I think so. What did he want? Does he think I'm a threat to him? I don't know. He must think you sent the e-mail... or that your memory will return. He's the driver, Olivia. If I had compromising information, I would have told the police. Dumas questioned me several times. People know I have memory issues. Did you see a car? I think I heard a motorbike. I don't know why you're implicated, but I'll find out. Not just for the investigation but to protect you. So I need your help. Do you have any photos of people you used to spend time with whom I can question today? Yes, photos. That's a good idea. I have some. Good. About yesterday... Forget about it. Sorry. Go ahead. Pick me up from Olivia's. See you soon. Have they found Lisa? A body was found in the canal, under a bridge. I have to go. It's Jérôme Vidal. Except facial bruising, he has no other injuries. He could have thrown him in alive. Dumas, send the tarp and straps to the lab. Of course. Ratchet straps are a bit over the top, aren't they? A rope would suffice. Why do that? Maybe he improvised with what he could find. Good news. It means we're closing in. Dumas, check who uses these straps in Doulac. Thanks. Lisa Moreau is still missing. The killer must have used Mr. Vidal's phone to text his wife. Two dead. Three, including Bénédicte Dubois. -That's a lot. -He has a lot to lose. The mayor? I saw his house: pool, tennis courts, he pushes the boat out. I'd like to question Jean-Marie Jourdain. You met the elderly woman again. Yes. She mentioned Vincent Lombardo too. Check the movements and phone records of all three men. Understood. It's great to have souvenirs. My ex took most of them, during my concerts and tours. The jerk who abandoned you? Honestly, it was a relief. Nothing's worse than disgust and pity. I'll make some tea. What will you say? That a granny profiled him? It isn't profiling; it's common sense. Who best knows Doulac's residents: the perceptive former teacher, or us, the new arrivals? Who reopened the dismissed Dubois case? The letter writer, somebody local. You have to work with people, Chief Inspector. Hello, I'm Chief Inspector Laure Martinez, and this is Judge Aubert. Do you have a minute? -Of course, come in. -Thank you. Working on a Sunday? It happens. So you work with your father? I work for my father. I'm his clerk. Why? Do you think I know something? Do you know something? No, but this whole thing is concerning. The e-mails are harmful. I don't want him to name-- Who? My father. He has been Doulac's only lawyer for 50 years. He's a prime target. -No concerns for yourself? -No. Me, I'd like to know who killed Bénédicte Dubois. Were you close? We'd see each other, but we didn't really get along. She was made out to be a saint. It's the total opposite. She was pretentious and hurtful. She put herself on a pedestal. I don't think she was killed by burglars. Why not? She had plans for the marshland. It ruffled many feathers. It's a protected area. Who, for example? Landowners, farmers, ecologists, the nature reserve, City Hall. Quite a few people. So she had a lot of enemies. That's what I'm saying. Can I send someone to verify your movements over the past few days? I'll be in the office until 7:00 p.m. tomorrow. I won't see you out. Thank you. Thanks. Thoughts? Why isn't he a lawyer? He already has an office with a list of clients. Yet he's happy being his father's assistant. Why? Maybe he's not good enough. Should I dig deeper? He has everything: the bike, the pick-up... Check the location of his phone when Olivia was threatened. Tomorrow, bring him to the station to check his movements. Dig deeper. Any news about Lisa Moreau? No, nothing. I found a link between Vidal and Chastagnet. In 2008, they worked together at the Dubois company. But it was the biggest employer in the region. Half the town worked there. But there's no link with Lisa Moreau who has always been a nurse. We need to know if they left the company at the same time. The message names them as crooks; he mentions scams. Check if they had issues with management. I confirmed the mayor's alibi. Sandra Duclot, from the nature reserve, confirmed she was at his house at 7:00 a.m., but she's lying. I knew immediately. She can't lie. Could this be the pick-up we're looking for? Who sent you that? Olivia, I'm at the station. I'll put you on speakerphone. When was this taken? 2010. I contracted the Dubois company to work on the house. I photographed the site. I was looking through old photos, and you mentioned a white pick-up. That's right. Are you sure it belonged to her husband? Absolutely. Bénédicte used it for her boat when we went rowing on the canal. Thank you, Olivia. Since Mrs. Dubois was killed, it has become a haunted house. Not a single visit in four years on the market. It was used recently. There are traces of rain. The keys are in the ignition. You were right, Chief Inspector. Tarps, like the one Vidal was wrapped in. Chief Inspector, get forensics in here. He was careful at the crime scenes, but there must be traces here. Don't move. That's the fifth shot. He's out of ammo. -What are you doing? -He hasn't reloaded. -Dumas. -I'm fine, go ahead. -Are you OK? -Yeah, just a bit of lead. I have two people with gunshot wounds at the Dubois house and the canal bank across from the house. It's urgent. The suspect escaped along the canal. He's armed and dangerous. Don't move. You never know. I'm sorry about your divorce. Is he the one leaving... or is it you? It's worse than that. We're not in love anymore. No arguments, no anger, just regrets. It's sad, isn't it? I found one good quality: you don't snore. I managed to get you out of the house. My first non-medical outing in four years, to a hospital. I brought your things. I'd like to take you to dinner. To a little restaurant I spotted. Welcome to the life of the disabled, Mr. Aubert. If my chair doesn't fit through the door, if there are stairs, if the room isn't adapted... I checked and measured everything. You're a romantic at heart. Especially for the past three days. -Hello, Chief Inspector. -Hello. How are you? How is Dumas? His operation went well. He's recovering. Great. I'll leave you. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. Thanks for my things. Sit down, please. We're taking samples at the Dubois house. Did you find anything out from Jourdain's phone operator? I hope it will come back today. VINCENT LOMBARDO IS THE THIRD BASTARD WHO COULD NAME THE MURDERER. IF HE WON'T TALK, I'LL NAME THE KILLER. Yes. OK, I'm on my way. Find Lombardo and bring him in. Immediately. What's going on? A patrol spotted a light on a boat near the Wi-Fi hotspot. I think we have our anonymous messenger. Coming? Mrs. Moreau, you added me to your list to bring me to Doulac. So, you must trust me somewhat. Am I right? In that case, you need to talk. It's a big risk: accessory to murder, slander, inciting violence. Don't make things worse. Tell me who's the killer. I don't know them. I did all this so he'd show himself. I thought you knew that. Why beat around the bush? You're accusing people of knowing the killer. Chastagnet, Vidal and now, Lombardo. Because they know, and I wanted them to confess. How do you know? Bénédicte Dubois told me... when she took over the business. She realized that the heating oil branch was in serious debt. She wanted to know why her husband died. She found out that, in the previous year, he had fired three employees from the heating oil team. Two drivers and a warehouse worker. -The drivers were Lombardo and Vidal. -The warehouse worker was Chastagnet. They'd lie about the volume when filling the trucks. Then, Lombardo and Vidal would lie on delivery. They'd end up with hundreds of gallons to resell. But it was too late. They had been fired. She had no proof and couldn't touch them. I don't understand. Where does the killer come in? Bénédicte was convinced, convinced, that Chastagnet, Vidal and Lombardo were working for someone else, a kind of boss who was smarter than them. Someone able to siphon off gallons of fuel without getting caught. Just before her murder, she came to me. She told me that she might know who they worked for, that Doulac would be shocked. Why didn't you say anything to the police or to me? Because I didn't know. I didn't know who she was talking about. If I had a name, I'd have said something. Wait. I spoke to the other judge. I told him everything, but he threw me out. I went back last year. He never replied. Why is Olivia involved? She was in Doulac when Bénédicte was killed. They were always together. The killer must have thought she had confided in her. She doesn't know. Leave her out of this. You staged your own kidnapping. Of course. I was scared. I realized that they had all received bribes to stay quiet. Chastagnet got a job at the school, Vidal got land in the marshes, and Lombardo bought his bar. What could I have done? And the judge... who dismissed the case... I lost it. I didn't think people would die. How could I have known that? I just wanted to do something for Bénédicte, do you understand? Does a name come to mind? You've had time, and you know everyone. If I knew, I'd tell you! Or I wouldn't have done this. Do your job, damn it! Lombardo is over an hour late to open his place. He isn't at home and is unresponsive. Jean-Marie Jourdain's phone records. Nothing to report. Lombardo is missing. We must question the mayor. Something isn't right. He's not as smart as I thought. Jourdain turned on airplane mode from 12:15 to 1:04 p.m. The exact time Olivia was threatened. It's not proof, but it's him, Chief Inspector. The Jourdains have been lawyers for generations. He must want to protect his family from the shame. Imagine the scandal. The last Jourdain is a fuel thief. It's him. Let's go. All clear upstairs, Your Honor. Your Honor! He's hurt. You hit him last night. Self-treating himself is almost a confession. He probably has Lombardo. Should I put out an all-points bulletin? Yes, please. Hello? Sorry, but I was worried. That's kind of you. Amélie said you found Lisa. Yes, she's alive. Do you know Jean-Marie Jourdain? I met him in 2014. Bénédicte introduced us. She had contracted his father's firm for a project and wanted to involve me. It was an ambitious yet interesting idea. I said yes. I loved the project. Keep going. She wanted to renovate the cement plant and had asked Jourdain's firm to research property deeds. Thanks, Olivia. -Do you know the old cement plant? -Yes, it is abandoned and enormous. Call for backup. I thought it was you. But you weren't sure. How could I be sure? Remember that night in your bar, with all four of us? I warned you. Bénédicte had us in her sights. She was going to hand us in. We had to do something. I remember, but to think that you'd kill her and attempt to kill her friend Olivia Sysman, just because she might have told her about our arrangement. What did you think? "Bénédicte was killed by burglars. What luck!" I only wanted to scare her. That bitch laughed at me. Luckily, I did the dirty work... or else you'd be in jail. Damn it, put the knife down! Don't be stupid. We're friends. I understand that you didn't trust the others. But me? If we were friends, you'd have known me better. You think I'd let you go? I didn't tell the police anything! You can trust me. I swear-- You all say the same thing. It's not me; it was him. The letter writer was right. You're pathetic. Jourdain. Drop the knife. Do as I say. Gunshot to the leg. Call an ambulance. She won't leave. She came to the hospital but refuses to be seen in Doulac in her chair. Thank you. Good evening. -What are we waiting for? -I don't know. After you. You look beautiful. Others think so too. Thank you. So you're leaving tomorrow? I'm meeting with the DA. He wants to talk about my future. Could you work from here? It's a possibility. Why did you choose this place? I thought it would be more private. It's the only place with a piano. Subtitling: Hiventy
