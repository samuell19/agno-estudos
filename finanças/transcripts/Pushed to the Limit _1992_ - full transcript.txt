EVERYTHING WILL BE OKAY, I PROMISE. THE LORD GIVETH LIFE AND THE LORD TAKETH UNTO HIM JOHN CORDON FOR ETERNAL LIFE. IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER AND OF THE SON AND OF THE HOLY GHOST. JOHN CORDON WAS BROUGHT INTO THIS WORLD AS A SPECIAL SOUL. THOUGH HIS YEARS WERE FEW, HIS MEMORIES WILL LIVE ON IN THE HEARTS OF ALL OF THOSE WHO LOVED HIM. JESUS TELLS US IN THE 14th CHAPTER OF JOHN, LET NOT YOUR HEART BE TROUBLED. IF YOU BELIEVE IN GOD, BELIEVE ALSO IN ME. IN MY FATHER'S HOUSE ARE MANY MANSIONS. YOU KNOW HOW SORRY I AM. I WANT THE PEOPLE WHO DID THIS TO JOHNNY AND NICK. AS FAR AS I KNOW, THE COPS DON'T HAVE A CLUE. [ CRYING ] I KNOW IT WAS HARRY LEE. HARRY LEE? THAT NARROWS IT DOWN. I KNOW DOZENS OF HARRY LEES. A CHINESE GUY? A DRUG PUSHER OUT OF CHINATOWN? NO, YOU DON'T MEAN THAT HARRY LEE. BELIEVE ME, THESE ARE NOT PEOPLE YOU WANT TO KNOW. I DON'T CARE. HE KILLED JOHNNY! MIMI, THIS GUY'S WORSE THAN THE MAFIA. HE'S GOT A CASINO IN L.A. THAT'S A FRONT FOR HIS ILLEGAL BUSINESSES: DRUGS, PROSTITUTION, EXTORTION. YOU NAME IT, HE'S GOT IT. HE EVEN RUNS A FULL CONTACT FIGHT TOURNAMENT. IT'S LIKE COCK FIGHTS, ONLY WITH PEOPLE. THE LOSER EITHER DIES OR WINDS UP LIKE NICK. THEY CALL IT THE KUMITE. THIS GUY'S IN SO TIGHT, THE POLICE CAN'T EVEN GET A WHISPER. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THEY ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE FAMILY. THIS GUY, HE LOVES SEEING PEOPLE KILLED. THAT'S WHAT HE'S ALL ABOUT. I CARE ABOUT YOU. THAT'S WHY I'M TELLING YOU THIS. STAY AWAY FROM HIM, MIMI. JUST STAY AWAY! MIMI. LET ME HELP YOU. I'LL REACH OUT TO SOME OF MY FRIENDS IN L.A., SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO. NO. WHAT COULD THEY DO FOR US? THANKS, THOUGH. I'LL HANDLE IT. THANKS FOR COMING, VERN. I REMEMBER WHEN JOHNNY AND I WERE KIDS. WE'D TALK FOR HOURS. MOM WAS ALWAYS WORKING, SO WE WERE THERE FOR EACH OTHER, YOU KNOW. I CAN'T JUST LET THIS GO. I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. YOU MUST LET IT GO, MIMI. LET THE POLICE HANDLE IT. OH, YOU HEARD WHAT THEY SAID. THEY HAVEN'T A CLUE. THEY'RE NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING. DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THESE KUMITE FIGHTS? YES, I KNOW ABOUT THE KUMITE. VERN, I HAVE TO GET AT LEE. PLEASE HELP ME GET HIM. ARE YOU KIDDING? NO. THOSE GIRLS ARE KILLERS. YOU'RE NOT READY FOR THIS. I CAN DO IT. JUST TEACH ME WHAT I NEED TO KNOW, PLEASE. THEY ALL KNOW MARTIAL ARTS. MIMI, THIS IS NOT A WRESTLING MATCH. THIS IS PURE, SIMPLE KILLING. I FOUGHT THE KUMITE A LONG TIME AGO. I ALMOST KILLED A MAN. I COULD STOP BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE. THEY DON'T. DO YOU KNOW ANY OTHER WAY I COULD GET AT LEE THEN? WELL, VERN, I'VE ALREADY DECIDED. WITH OR WITHOUT YOU, I'M GONNA DO IT. OKAY. LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT. OKAY. THANKS. ALEJANDRO, SO GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. MR. VERN, IT'S GOOD SEEING YOU HERE AGAIN. HOW YOU BEEN? VERY GOOD. VERY GOOD. THANK YOU. PLEASE COME WITH ME. THANK YOU. IT'S OKAY. LET HIM IN. [ CHEERING ] THAT'S LEE OVER THERE. WHAT? I SAID THAT'S LEE OVER THERE. WHO'S THE MUSCLE NEXT TO HIM? INGA, HIS CHAMP. STOP STARING AT HER. YOU DON'T WANNA START A FIGHT HERE. YES, I DO. LET'S JUST KILL HIM NOW. MIMI, YOU DON'T WANNA KILL ANYBODY. BESIDES, YOU'D BE DEAD BEFORE YOU TOOK TWO STEPS. [ CHEERING ] IT IS TIME. CHECK HER OUT. [ SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] DO YOU GET MY POINT? WHAT? I SAID DO YOU GET MY POINT? I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN. HI, VERN. I'M HERE TO TRAIN. I REALLY NEED YOUR HELP. [ SIGHS ] COMBINATIONS. VERN. VERN, TRY ME! I'M PUSHED TO THE LIMIT. PUSHED TO THE LIMIT. YOU'LL DO EXACTLY AS I SAY? YOU'VE GOT IT. IT'S A DEAL. FINE. QUIET! GENTLEMEN, THIS IS MY NEWEST STUDENT MIMI. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] [ DING ] [ DING ] FELL THE BELL IN THE CENTER OF YOUR CHEST, YOUR HEART. [ DING ] FEEL THE BELL IN YOUR LOWER BELLY, THE CENTER OF YOUR CHI. RELAX. LISTEN FOR THE FIRST SOUND. DON'T LABEL YOURSELF. LISTEN. ALL THE WAY! COME ON! COME ON! UP, MIMI. THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S GOOD. GOOD. ONE MORE. COME ON. COME ON, YOU CAN DO IT. IMAGINE A MOUNTAIN. BECOME THE MOUNTAIN. FEEL THE IMMENSITY AND THE POTENCY OF THE MOUNTAIN. IMAGINE A TREE. BECOME THE TREE. FEEL THE SPLENDOR AND THE VITALITY OF THE TREE. WATCH MY EYES, NOT MY BODY. WOW, IT LOOKS LIKE A LOT OF FUN. HEY, VERN, WHEN DO I GET IN? IT ISN'T FUN. YOU BETTER WORK ON YOUR COORDINATION SYSTEM FIRST. I AM COORDINATED. YEAH, YOU'RE COORDINATED, BUT WHEN YOU'RE MENTALLY, PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY DOWN, THAT'S WHEN YOU'RE REALLY COORDINATED. I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT THAT WAY. HOLD IT RIGHT THERE. UNTIL YOU CAN REACH YOUR CHI, YOUR LIFE FORCE, AND PUT IT TO THE PLACE WHERE IT'S NEEDED, YOU FIGHT TWO PEOPLE, THE OPPONENT AND YOURSELF. VERN, I CAN'T JUST LET SOME KIND OF AUTOPILOT TAKE OVER. I THINK WHILE I'M MOVING. THAT'S HOW I FIGHT MY BEST. MIMI, YOU BALANCE YOUR MIND, YOU BALANCE YOUR EMOTIONS, AND YOUR PHYSICAL BODY AND THE SPIRIT BECOME YOUR AUTOPILOT. THEY'RE GONNA BE PUNCHING WHERE YOU'RE AT. DON'T BE THERE. DON'T BE THERE. THIS IS THE VIRTUE POSITION OF ACTION. ACTION IS THE DIRECTION OF ONE'S ENERGY TOWARDS SELF-REALIZATION AND THE WELL-BEING OF HUMANITY. MAKE A LIGHT FIST WITH YOUR LEFT HAND, PUT IT TO YOUR RIGHT SHOULDER, AND FOLLOW WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND. THIS IS THE VIRTUE POSITION OF COURAGE. COURAGE IS THE RECOGNITION THAT WE ALL HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY FOR TOTAL COMPLETE SELF-REALIZATION. PUT YOUR THUMB AND FOREFINGERS TOGETHER AND THE BACKS OF YOUR HANDS ON YOUR KNEES. THIS IS THE VIRTUE POSITION OF TRUTHFULNESS. TRUTHFULNESS IS THE HONEST ACCEPTANCE OF ONE'S SELF. ALL RIGHT, NOT TOO HARD. [ GROANS ] OKAY, TELL ME WHEN IT HURTS. OKAY, RIGHT ABOUT THERE. IN THE OLD DAYS, GREAT FIGHTERS COULD GET OUT OF ANY HOLD SO THEY COULDN'T BE PINNED. EVERYTHING IS BASED ON ENDURANCE AND A REAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE SPORT. AM I READY NOW? OKAY, KID. FULL CONTACT. OKAY, THAT'S IT! ALL RIGHT! COME ON, GO FOR IT, DALE! ALL RIGHT! SEE? [ LAUGHS ] I TOLD YOU YOU WEREN'T READY FOR NO KUMITE. COME ON, DALE. THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT, DALE. PUT HER DOWN. COME ON, DALE. GET HER, DALE. COME ON, DALE. COME ON, SEND HER HOME. PUT HER AWAY. COME ON, SOCK IT TO HER, MAN. OH, MAN. OH! AM I READY FOR KUMITE? HEY, BABY, WHAT YOU GOT IN THE BAG FOR US? MY GYM STUFF. A PAIR OF DIRTY SOCKS. LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT IN HERE, BABY. HERE! YOU TAKE A LOOK! HEY, BITCH, WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM? GOT SOMETHING ELSE FOR US NOW? QUITE IMPRESSIVE, MIMI. VERN! I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WOULD DO THAT TO ME. WHAT A DIRTY TRICK. I KNOW, BUT IT WORKED. YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. I HOPE YOU DIDN'T HURT THESE GUYS. YOU GUYS OKAY? WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WE WERE GETTING INTO. NOW? WE'LL SEE. ARE YOU SCARED? HUH? I SAID ARE YOU AFRAID? YEAH, A LITTLE. A LITTLE? OKAY, A LOT. GOOD. SO AM I. JUST REMEMBER, WHEN YOU FIGHT OR WHATEVER YOU DO, YOUR SPIRIT IS ALWAYS WITH YOU. THANKS, VERN. I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT. IT MAY SOUND FUNNY, BUT I ALWAYS DREAMT ABOUT SOMEBODY LIKE YOU. I MEAN, SOMEBODY REALLY CARING, YOU KNOW. YOU'RE LIKE A DAD TO ME. I'M NOT THAT OLD, THANK YOU. [ LAUGHS ] IT'S AN HONOR TO HAVE YOU BACK AGAIN, MY FRIEND. WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE? KUMITE. I SEE. NOT ME. HARRY LEE, MAY I INTRODUCE YOU TO THE NEXT WOMAN'S KUMITE CHAMPION, MAGNIFICENT MIMI. MAGNIFICENT MIMI. I'VE HEARD ABOUT YOU. WOMEN'S WRESTLING CHAMPION. THAT'S RIGHT. OUR STAKES ARE MUCH HIGHER. I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES. [ CHUCKLES ] WHICH MIGHT BE YOUR DEATH. JUST ANOTHER FIGHT TO THE FINISH. I ADMIRE YOUR COURAGE, BUT I'M AFRAID I CAN'T LET YOU FIGHT IN THE KUMITE BEFORE I KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO. ANY TIME. THIS AIN'T NO PLACE FOR HOOKERS, BITCH. GET OUTTA HERE BEFORE YOU BREAK A NAIL. YOU TALKING TO ME? IS THAT YOUR ROBERT DE NIRO ACT? YOU TALKING TO ME? DIDN'T YOUR MOTHER TEACH YOU ANY MANNERS? I'M GONNA TEACH YOU SOMETHING YOU'LL REMEMBER FOR A LONG TIME. OH, YEAH? YEAH. SHE'S A VERY GOOD FIGHTER. I'M IMPRESSED. SHE WAS A VERY GOOD FIGHTER. [ ALL LAUGH ] I THINK SHE'LL BE OUT FOR A LONG TIME. YOU STILL WISH TO FIGHT? OH, YES. HI, MOM. MIMI? MOM, I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU. I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF SOME BUSINESS THAT DEALS WITH JOHNNY AND NICK, AND I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU THAT IF ANYTHING SHOULD EVER HAPPEN TO ME, I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU THAT I'LL ALWAYS LOVE YOU. MIMI, WHAT'S GOING ON? YOU'RE NEVER LIKE THIS. CAN'T I JUST SAY I LOVE YOU EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE? OF COURSE YOU CAN. I LOVE YOU, TOO. I MISS JOHNNY. [ BOTH CRY ] I MISS HIM, TOO, MOM... BUT EVERYTHING WILL BE OKAY. [ CROWD CHEERS ] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO TONIGHT'S MAIN EVENT, KUMITE! THE UNDERCARD HAS ALREADY CAUSED SOME EXCITEMENT! YES! ARE WE READY TO MAKE SOME MONEY?

OKAY. OKAY, BE SURE. THANK YOU FOR COMING. YOU'RE WELCOME. HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN FIGHTING? ABOUT SEVEN YEARS. HMM. I WONDER... WHAT? WHAT MAKES A WRESTLING CHAMP SUDDENLY DECIDE TO DO KUMITE? IT'S A CHALLENGE AND... I'M A WOMAN OF THE NINETIES. I'VE HEARD YOU RECENTLY HAD A SAD ACCIDENT IN YOUR FAMILY. YOUR BROTHER, I BELIEVE? YES, AND THE POLICE HAVE NO IDEA WHO DID IT. IT WAS PROBABLY SOME SCUM WHO NEEDED MONEY. SO I TAKE ON A DIFFERENT CHALLENGE INSTEAD. VERY GOOD. LET ME TELL YOU, REVENGE IS HARDLY A WORTHY CAUSE TO DIE FOR. YOU COULD BE MY NUMBER ONE FIGHTER IF IT WEREN'T FOR INGA. SHE IS UNBEATABLE. NOBODY'S UNBEATABLE. THAT MIGHT BE TOUGH. SHE IS THE ABSOLUTE NUMBER ONE IN KUMITE. IF YOU WIN TOMORROW, THEN YOU FIGHT HER. FINE. AND IF YOU WIN, IT WILL BE VERY LUCRATIVE FOR YOU. YEAH? HOW MUCH? $500,000 AND THE HONOR OF WEARING THE WOMEN'S KUMITE CHAMPIONSHIP BELT. HOWEVER, IF YOU LOSE... I KNOW THE RISK. I'M IN. [ CHUCKLES ] GET SOME REST. YOU WILL NEED IT. WAYANABI WILL TAKE YOU BACK. INGA IS WINNER. REMAINS UNDEFEATED WOMEN'S MIGHTY CHAMPION, [ SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] MIMI IS BACK TO FIGHT QUATRO, ONE OF THE STRONGEST WOMEN FIGHTERS. [ SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] MIMI REMAINS UNDEFEATED.

I BELIEVE SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE'S GETTING HERSELF INTO. SHE DOESN'T. SHE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING. YES, WELL, PERHAPS WE WILL DISCUSS THIS OVER DINNER. COME ON. WHY DID YOU BRING TERRI TO FIGHT IN THE KUMITE? SHE HAS A BAD DRUG PROBLEM. MANY ATHLETES DO. THAT IS HOW WE CAN HAVE SUCH WONDERFUL ASSOCIATIONS. MORE CHAMPAGNE? YES, PLEASE. PLEASE, MR. LEE. I'M ASKING A FAVOR OF YOU. LET HER GO. CALL ME HARRY. YOU KNOW, I ADMIRE YOU. YOU NOT ONLY HAVE CLASS AND BRAINS, BUT COMPASSION AS WELL. THEN WHY ARE YOU SO SURPRISED? NOT SURPRISED, FASCINATED. PERHAPS WE CAN SEE EACH OTHER MORE OFTEN APART FROM THIS CRAZY SPORT. I HARDLY CONSIDER THIS A SPORT. WHY DO YOU FIGHT THEN? TO BE NUMBER ONE, TO BE THE BEST. MOST ATHLETES COME HERE WITH THE SAME NOBLE SPIRIT. WITH A WOUNDED BODY, YOU MUST ALLOW CONSCIOUSNESS TO HEAL YOU FROM WITHIN. BOY, I'M GETTING TOO OLD FOR THIS SHIT. [ BOTH LAUGH ] THIS IS FOR YOU. A GIFT. NO, I COULDN'T, MR. LEE. OLD CUSTOM. YOU MUST TAKE IT OR IT WILL BE AN INSULT. AND CALL ME HARRY. WHY DO YOU WANT TO GIVE THIS TO ME? A TOKEN OF MY APPRECIATION. IT'S BEAUTIFUL, BUT I CAN'T.

TURN AROUND. GO BACK. VERN, I'VE GOT IT. I CAN'T FIND THE KEY. TA-DA! THIS IS WHAT WE NEED, MIMI. FRANK! WAYANABI! DAMN, THAT WAS A CLOSE CALL. BOY, I'LL SAY. NEED A GLASS OF WINE? YES. VERN, I WANNA KILL THAT BASTARD FOR WHAT HE DID TO JOHNNY. MIMI, IF YOU KILL LEE, NOTHING CHANGES. JUST ONE MORE DEAD DRUG DEALER. BUT IF YOU BRING HIS WHOLE ORGANIZATION INTO THE LIGHT, NOT ONLY YOU BENEFIT, BUT EVERYBODY BENEFITS. ALL HUMANITY BENEFITS. I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT. GOOD. WE'LL GO TO THE AUTHORITIES IN THE MORNING. WE GOT ENOUGH INFORMATION IN HERE TO SEND LEE UP FOR A LONG TIME, IF THE BATTERIES LAST. [ LAUGHS ] I'LL PICK YOU UP IN THE MORNING. HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. WHERE IS IT?
