Part Two 1st Byelorussian Front, June 24, 3 a.m. In the course of the past day, Operation Bagration was successfully developing. Bagramyan broke the German front, forced the crossing of the Western Dvina and surrounded Vitebsk. Chernyakhovsky is rapidly advancing, with his right flank, to the Berezina in the direction of Borisov. Zakharov's 2nd Byelorussian Front has successfully broken the defenses and is moving to Mogilev. The Byelorussian partisans have done a very good job. Last night they paralyzed all the railways in the enemy's rear. Well, now is your turn. The direction of the main blow. Judging by all reports, the Germans still don't expect our blow here. I got everything ready, we only have to lay a corduroy road. Why are you lingering? We decided to drive in the piles during the artillery preparation, for the Germans not to hear it spot us and open fire. Will you be able to do it in time? We must. Well... As Bonaparte said, artillery, forward! Come on, swam army, follow me! Forward! Everyone will get a medal! Forward! Follow me! Forward! Let Panov's corps go. "Storm-5"! Five! Five! Commander of the 1st Guards Armoured Corps Major-General Panov Well, good luck, boys. "Storm"! "Storm"! First gear, 100-meter interval, don't lag behind. Panov's tank corps made a gap in the enemy battle formations, and is rapidly moving to Bobruisk. Exploiting Panov's success, the rifle corps of the 65th and 28th Armies and Pliev's group are pushing further north. Sensing the threat of encirclement, the enemy wavered and, according to air reconnaissance, withdraws behind the Berezina. What are you planning to do? I want to throw in all reserves at the right flank and break through to Bobruisk from the east. And simultaneously commit the Dnieper Flotilla. It will strike at the enemy crossing points and secure them. The Berezina River June 25, 8 a.m. Brigade Commander of the Dnieper Military Flotilla Captain of the Second Rank Lyalko All ships get ready for a landing operation! Field Marshal Model Commander of Army Group Center Field Marshal Buchs Field Marshal, the Fuhrer entrusted me with a difficult mission to inform you that I have to replace you at our post. I already know that. You're facing a more difficult mission to stop the Russian offensive. What is the situation at this moment? The armies of Bagramyan and Chernyakhovsky have occupied Polotsk, Vitebsk, Orsha, and are pushing towards Vilnius and Minsk, going round the left flank of the main forces of Army Group Center. Rokossovsky's troops have broken through to Bobruisk and trapped there 40,000 of our soldiers. How could the Russians be so successful? They acted against any military logic. There's only one logic in war - knowing how to win. Who commands the surrounded troops in Bobruisk? - General Haman. - I want to talk with him. We'll break through, Herr Field Marshal. We'll break the encirclement. Give the soldiers all our stock of schnapps! There's no way back to the city! Set everything on fire! Everything! BOBRUISK June 28, 2 a.m. What? What are you doing? You're my wife, and I'm not afraid of anybody. I'm your field wife, as long as the war goes on. And then you'll fall out of love with me and forget me. Stop it, Zoya. I'm happy I've found you at war, I wouldn't have found you otherwise. I love you. Division, with a volley, fire! Fire! All German counterattacks from the Bobruisk cauldron had been repulsed. On June 29, our troops had liberated the city of Bobruisk. Please accept this with our respect, Your Excellency Comrade General. Thank you. But why Excellency? If you're a general, it means you're excellent. No, it's they who are excellent, our soldiers. So we've learned how to beat Germans? It seems so, father, we've learned. After their defeat at Vitebsk and Bobruisk, the Germans, instead of retreating, engaged in prolonged frontal fighting. And thus, I believe, they made a big mistake. That's why you have a new task to carry out. Panov's 1st Tank Corps should advance to Minsk, with the main forces concentrated on Slutsk and Baranovichi, in order to cut off the routes for the enemy's retreat. Chernyakhovsky is already advancing to Minsk. We must completely surround them as soon as possible. So, by completely surrounding them and destroying their Minsk grouping, we'll end up the first stage of Operation Bagration. And then we'll get down to the second stage. We're speaking, comrades, about the 1st Byelorussian Front advancing in the direction Kovel-Brest and approaching Poland's border. We begin the liberation of Poland, comrades. We invited you in order to clarify the action of the 1st Polish Army. What's the latest information about the Polish resistance? Yesterday we received a coded message from Comrade Duniak. He reports that five partisan brigades are advancing to the Vistula, to assist the Red Army in securing the crossings. And now about the actions of the Polish Army. We would like, Comrade Marshal, the Polish Army to be attacking in the first echelon. Well, General, shall we show Germans that Poland is still alive and kicking? We'll sure show them, Comrade Marshal! But wait, before that I'll have to capture Minsk. Tell Panov that the direction is Minsk. South-west of Minsk 1st Guards Armoured Corps Turn to north-west immediately, cut off the routes of retreat for the Germans, and join with the 3rd Byelorussian Front. You have to complete the encirclement and not let the enemy out. Roger. I got you. I'm 50 kilometers ahead of the infantry. Am turning north-west. Storm, we're turning north-westward. The direction is Minsk Forward! Who are you? We're partisans from Kozlov's brigade. Get on here. Get on the tanks. The infantry is just what I need. Hey, boys, get on the tanks! Move it! Give it more life! MINSK Cargo Station Come here! - How was the attack? - Great - And what's this? - A pillow, Comrade General. I got hold of it in a train car It's too hard here. Want to travel in a sleeping car? Forward! Come on, forward! Stop! That's ours! A bit longer, and we would have tousled one another. - 3rd Byelorussian? - Right. Commander of the 2nd Guards Corps Burdeiny. Commander of the 1st Corps Panov. - So the Germans are in a circle? - It's not a circle, call cauldron. Let's embrace as a sign of our meeting, 1st Byelorussian. Let's do it, 3rd Byelorussian. Comrade Stalin, the surrounded east of Minsk 105,000-strong Germans grouping has been destroyed by the armies of Chernyakhovsky and Rokossovsky. 57,000 have been taken prisoner. Our troops are advancing towards the Polish border. According to our intelligence, Comrade Stalin, the Germans Command has transferred a great number of troops from the south to stop the gape, thereby weakening its grouping facing the 1st Ukrainian Front. Marshal Konev proposes to take advantage of that and strike in the direction of Lvov and Sandomir, in accordance with the adopted plan. Let Konev begin. Comrade Antonov, what do the Germans report in their official summaries of operations in Byelorussia? They claim they're withdrawing from Byelorussia according to their plan. You're taking prisoners. Yet neither the enemy nor the allies believe you. Do not hide your prisoners. Show them, let everybody see. MOSCOW BERLIN Come for me in an hour. Herr von Kluge, if I'm not mistaken? You're right, Herr Field Marshal von Witzleben. Come in, we've been waiting for you. Your transfer to the West, is that a punishment? What difference does it make? The Furer still believes that we can be saved by replacing commanders. I have a different opinion. Have you already made our decision? Are there resolute people? Men of action? There are. And they're ready to resort to the extreme measures? Certainly. I'd like to meet with them. Excuse me, I'll be right back. This way, please. I'm glad to see you, Colonel-General Bek. Let me introduce to you our friends. Doctor Carl Goerdeler. Well, you've met before. General Friedrich Olbricht, Deputy Commander of the Reserve Army. Colonel Count Claus von Stauffenberg, Chief of Staff of the Reserve Army. Our army can be proud of such officers. Herr Field Marshal, may I introduce to you Oberleutnant Werner von Haeften, adjutant to the Chief of Staff of the Reserve Army. Please, sit down, gentlemen. You've come just in time, Herr Field Marshal. We're trying here to understand what's happening on the Eastern Front. The front has been broken in many places. The Russian offensive is going on so rapidly. In Byelorussia, they advance 40 kilometers each day. It seems they're already approaching the Polish borders. In short, the Russian armies are at the gates to Europe. Gentlemen. There's only one thing left for us to do - remove Hitler and make peace in the West. Then we'll be able to throw all our forces against Russia and fulfill our historic mission - stop Communism at German's gates. You're still thinking in obsolete categories, Dr. Goeldeler. The Communists have long been operating in Germany. You think that the Communist Party of German doesn't exist, but they're a real force. I don't picture the new Germany without Socialists and Communists. That's why I insist on making peace with the West and the East. Gentlemen, our political differences must not stand in our way. Our objective is to save Germany from defeat. Let's get down to discussing the details of Operation Valkyrie. Please, Count Stauffenberg. Gentlemen, please make no written notes. The Valkyrie's signal will be passed to the troops by all means of communication. It will transfer all the executive power to the army. Following the Valkyrie signal, it is necessary to cordon off the government quarter in the Reich's capital, occupy government and party offices, the radio station the telegraph, arrest Goebbels. Excuse me, Stauffenberg. I agree to you proposals, but I would like to know one thing: when you give the Valkyrie signal, will Hitler be alive? I'm taking this action on myself. On July I'll be at the Wolfsschanze to report on the situation of reserves. July 20 Good morning, Werner. Claus is expecting you in his study. - Would you like to have breakfast? - No, thank you. Good morning, Herr Colonel Good morning, Werner. Which briefcase is mine? They'll identical, as diplomats say. You're in a good humor, Werner, it's always easy to deal with you. We're going to visit the Fuhrer. How can we be gloomy? I'll take this one. The capsule is here. And this is pliers to crush the capsule. And remember, you'll have only 10 minutes, not a second more. You think I don't want to live longer? May God help us. RASTENBURG July 20, 12 hours Your passes, please. Your special passes. You can drive on. The Fuhrer has changed the schedule. Your report is not at 14 hours, but at 12:30. And not in the bunker, but at the staff barrack. Yes, sir. Let's go. Herr Field Marshal, excuse me, I forgot my cap. Hurry up. Hurry, Stauffenberg, we're being late. I'm sorry, Herr Field Marshal. At Brest, Field Marshal Model is successfully repulsing the attacks of Russian tanks. Model was in a desperate situation, but he reduced the front and gathered all his forces in one fist. Heusinger! Why do you say nothing about my 21 generals who surrendered to Russians? You think I'm going to bow my head in mourning? They've saved their skins, but for us those cowards are dead. They were paraded through Moscow's streets like wild animals. And I'm happy about it! They deserve it. Go on, Heusinger. The Russian troops forced a crossing of the Western Bug with heavy losses and entered the Generalgouvernement. The Bolsheviks will never be in the Generalgouvernement! I believe Model! But we must help him with reserves. Maybe Colonel Stauffenberg will report now on the situation with the reserve units? No, only at the end of the conference. What's the situation in the north, Heusinger? I have to make a call to Berlin. Brandt, bring the maps. - How long will it take now? - Just seconds. To the airfield. Let us out It's the Fuhrer's order! By the Commandant's order, the exit is forbidden. Give me Field Marshal Keitel now! It's Stauffenberg They don't let me out. And I got the Fuhrer's order to fly to Berlin immediately. Open up! BERLIN 16 hours 40 minutes The bomb detonated. The briefcase was at the Fuhrer's feet He just couldn't survive. Lieutenant Roering, get in touch with Leipzig and Munich. The Operation Valkyrie is on. And now let's go to Fromm. Commander of the Reserve Army Colonel-General Fromm Herr Colonel-General, Hitler has become a victim of assassination. Hitler is alive. I've just spoken to Keitel. He told me about the explosion at the Wolfsschanze, but Hitler wasn't killed. Keitel is lying, as usual. Hitler is dead. I planted a bomb under him. You must shoot yourself now. Colonel-General Bek, what's going on? It's Operation Valkyrie. But it's a plot! Colonel-General, we begin a struggle for the new Germany. Do you want to join us? You're talking to the future head of state. Future, but not present. Hitler is alive. I'm carrying out his orders. Gentlemen, you're under arrest. I have to arrest you, General. What is this? Arrest this man. He betrayed our nation at the most critical moment. You've gone too far. You'll be sorry about that. To the basement! Check if Goebbels has been arrested. Major Remer's guard battalion has been sent for him. I need to see Dr. Goebbels. - Who are you? - I'm Major Remer. On what matter? I'll report to him. I've got orders to arrest Dr. Goebbels. Who wants to arrest me? I received an order from Berlin's Military Commandant. I'm a Reich Minister. No one can arrest me but the Fuhrer. The Fuhrer has been killed and, as the Military Commandant told me, the power has been transferred to a new Chancellor. No, Major, the Fuhrer is alive. I'll put you through to him on the phone. Stay here. It's Goebbels. I wish to speak to the Fuhrer. This oak table saved me from the blast. I take it as a manifestation of God's will that direct me in pursuing the aim of my life. It's a real miracle, my Fuhrer. I know it was the generals' conspiracy. I've never trusted them. When I gain victories, the take the credit for them, and in case of a failure, they accuse me of it. This criminal clique of traitors must be ruthlessly exterminated. My Fuhrer, Reich Minister Goebbels wants to speak to you urgently. I'm listening, Goebbels. My Fuhrer, I have here Major Remer, commander of the guard battalion, who got orders from Berlin's Military Commandant to arrest me. Get Major Remer on the phone. Major Remer is listening. I cancel the military commandant's order. Is it understood? I promote you to the rank of colonel and appoint you Commander of Berlin garrison. Immediately arrest all traitors and betrayers who tried to stab the great German in the back. If anyone resists, shoot them on the spot. Act in my name, Colonel Remer! Yes, my Fuhrer. An appeal to the German people. Hitler is dead. We want to stop this senseless war and achieve a just peace. Has Goebbels been arrested, Herr General? I think he has been by now. How are things going? The approaches to radio stations are guarded by the fortified SS details. Take the radio station by storm. The new head of state Bek is to go on the air now. It's Paris. Put me through to Field Marshal Kluge. Bek speaking. I'm informing you that Hitler has been killed. I received news to the contrary from the Wolfsschanze. Kluge, make up our mind! The fate of Germany and Europe depends on you now. I'll call you again after dinner. It's just like Kluge. Hands up! Claus, are you all right? Your mutiny has failed. It's not a mutiny. We were saving the future of Germany, Major. I'm Colonel Remer. Oh, you're colonel. If you have at least some honor left... It's not for you to speak of honor. You've betrayed the Fuhrer. Even if he escaped death now, he'll be executed anyway. It's you who will be executed. Take everybody to the courtyard. Leave General Bek here. Bek, you were my teacher once. I had poor pupils among others. We have no time for puns. This is all I can do for you. Would you like me to pass anything on to your family? No, nothing. My wife knows everything. Help this old man. I announce the court martial verdict. For activities constituting high treason and damaging the Fuhrer... sentenced to execution by firing squad are Colonel Mertz von Quirnheim, Infantry General Olbricht, this colonel and this lieutenant, whose names I don't even want to remember. Germany will remember our names. Carry out the verdict immediately. Lieutenant Schade, do it. My Fuhrer, the conspirators who made an attempt at your life have been executed. The retribution has been done. Unfortunately, Stauffenberg has escaped the noose. Stauffenberg! For how long I'll be hearing that name? I ordered to send his wife and children to the camp. Everybody, everybody must forget him. Himmler, dig him up from his grave, burn him and scatter the ashes. There must not be either his name or his grave. My Fuhrer, you once mentioned Stauffenberg's family. Yes, the ancient Germans had a fine custom of blood feud. We should apply that custom to the Stauffenberg family. He must be destroyed, Himmler! Yes, my Fuhrer. I want to introduce to you the new Chief of the General Staff, Colonel-General Guderian. General Guderian is a prominent theorist in panzer forces. In the late 20s he finished a tank school in Russia. He knows about the Red Army's tactics as no one else. Come on, Guderian, make your report. My Fuhrer, now is the time when you must receive only absolutely accurate information. Any attempt to smooth the situation will lead to tragic consequences I'll begin with the losses. In the last three months our losses amounted to 1 million 200 thousand men. I have 5.5 million under arms and 2 million reserves in the rear. This is a great force. I shall stop the Russian offensive. I won't let them into Europe! LONDON To Prime Minister Mr. Churchill, personally. Sir, the latest news from Germany. Unfortunately, the plot against Hitler failed. The conspirators have been executed. The top officers have been arrested. Did you say "unfortunately"? Yes, sir. Don't you think that success of the conspiracy would have made headway? Headway? You mean peace, perhaps? Maybe so, sir. If the conspirators had killed Hitler, it wouldn't have served, our purposes. And I trust that Stalin doesn't want it, either. Only fools would accept peace when the smell of victory is in the air. Just imagine that the end of the war would see us in Normandy and Stalin somewhere at Poland's border. By the way, about Poland. Is there anything new there? Russian troops are advancing to the border. Now here you can say "unfortunately", sir. I foresaw a situation in Teheran. And now we're faced with the most serious problem. From Marshal Stalin for you, sir. Was there no letter? I noticed long ago that Uncle Joe adores his own portraits. It's not as simple as all that. There must be something behind it. Somewhere he's got the better of me. Oh yes, of course, be Russian troops have crossed the Polish border. THE WESTERN BUG Frankly speaking, I'm overcome with emotions. For five years I've been thinking of the day when we approach the Polish border. We've come to the border at 15:36 Let s remember that, General. I'll remember that hour, too, Comrade Generals. Forward! To Poland! The army of the Soviet people, together with the soldiers of the Polish Army, had stepped on the long-suffering Polish land. The liberation of the enslaved Europe had begun. Still ahead there were Warsaw and Budapest, Belgrade and Sofia, Vienna and Bucharest, Bratislava and Prague. Berlin was ahead! End of Film Three
