[BANJO PLAYING] [MAN VOCALIZING] Man: "I USED TO CALL MYSELF JACK THE NIMBLE "AND JACK THE QUICK AFTER JACK JOHNSON, "WHO WAS, BY ALL ACCOUNTS AND ALL ODDS, "THE NIMBLEST-FOOTED, QUICKEST-WITTED JACK OF THEM ALL... "WHO COULD SPRING 6 FEET BACKWARDS "AND OUT OF PUNCHING RANGE FROM A STANDSTILL, "WHOSE EYES AND HANDS WERE SO SHARP THAT HE COULD REACH OUT AND SNATCH FLIES FROM MID-AIR WITHOUT CRUSHING THEM..." "WHICH IS WHY THERE WAS A CEMENT-SACK PUNCHING BAG "HANGING HEAVYWEIGHT-HIGH FROM THE LOWEST BRANCH OF THE CHINABERRY TREE, "PLUS ALSO A NARROW CIRCLE THAT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO STAND UP AND STEP INTO "WHEN LITTLE BUDDY SAID DING, AND STAY THERE FEINTING "AND JABBING AND BOBBING AND WEAVING AND HOOKING AND CROSSING AND SNEAKING COMBINATIONS UNTIL HE SAID DONG..." "BECAUSE WHEN THE KU KLUX KLAN GOT MAD "AND PUT ON ITS WHITE ROBES AND STARTED BURNG CROSSES "JUST BECAUSE SOMEBODY SAID BRING ME MY COFFEE AS BLACK AND STRONG AS JACK JOHNSON "AND MY SCRAMBLED EGGS ALL BEAT UP LIKE POOR OLD JIM JEFFRIES, "I WAS THE ONE THEY WANTED TO COME AND LYNCH. "AS SOON AS I STEPPED INTO THE PRIZE RING, "I WAS THE ONE WHO HAD SET OUT FROM GALVESTON, TEXAS, "NOT ONLY TO SEE THE SIGHTS OF THE NATION "AND TO SEEK MY FORTUNE WHEREVER THE CHANCES WERE, BUT ALSO TO BECOME THE UNDISPUTED CHAMPION OF THE WORLD." "I WAS THE ONE WHO HAD HAD TO FOLLOW TOMMY BURNS "ALL THE WAY TO SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA, TO KNOCK HIM OUT "AND BRING BACK THE GOLDEN BELT. "I WAS THE ONE WHO WAS THE SCANDAL OF SAN FRANCISCO "AND CHICAGO AND NEW YORK CITY, "AS FAMOUS FOR MY CUSTOM-BUILT SPORTS CARS AS FOR MY TAILOR-MADE SUITS." "I HAD COME UP FROM THE KNOCKDOWN "AND BROKEN OFF STANLEY KETCHEL'S FRONT TEETH AT THE GUM "WITH ONE JAM PULLED RIGHT THAT TIME I HAD AGREED "TO TAKE IT EASY FOR A 20-ROUND EXHIBITION, "BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT WAS MY WAY OF SHOWING HIM THAT I KNEW "THAT THE PAPERS WERE ALL SET TO DECLARE HIM THE UNDISPUTED CHAMPION IF HE WOULD BRING BACK OLD JOHN L. SULLIVAN'S COLOR LINE..." "WHICH I CROSSED "EVERY TIME I STEPPED INTO THE WORKOUT CIRCLE AROUND THE PUNCHING BAG." ALBERT MURRAY. [RINGSIDE BELL RINGS] [CROWD CHEERING] Narrator: BY 1910, JACK JOHNSON, THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION OF THE WORLD, HAD SUCCESSFULLY DEFENDED HIS TITLE AGAINST EVERY WHITE CHALLENGER, EVERY WHITE HOPE, THAT CAME AT HIM, INCLUDING THE FORMER CHAMPION JIM JEFFRIES, WHOM HE DEMOLISHED AT RENO IN THE BATTLE OF THE CENTURY. HIS VICTORY HAD PROVOKED RACE RIOTS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. JACK JOHNSON'S AMBITION AND TALENT AND QUICK WITS, HIS EXTRAORDINARY FINANCIAL SUCCESS, FONDNESS FOR FAST LIVING, AND REFUSAL TO FOLLOW RULES SET BY OTHERS HAD ALL HELPED MAKE HIM A HERO AMONG MANY BLACK AMERICANS. BUT MOST WHITES, WHO STILL SAW THE COUNTRY AS THEIRS TO RUN, FOUND THOSE SAME QUALITIES, WHEN EMBODIED IN A BLACK MAN, A DANGEROUS THREAT. STILL WORSE, FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW, JACK JOHNSON DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE WHAT THEY THOUGHT. FOR THAT, HE WOULD BE MADE TO PAY. Man as Johnson: "NEVER IN THE WILDEST MOMENTS OF MY BOYHOOD IMAGINATION, "DID I VISION MYSELF THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION OF THE WORLD "AND THE FIRST MAN OF MY RACE EVER TO ATTAIN THAT DISTINCTION. "HOW UTTERLY FANTASTIC WHEN I WAS A BOY WOULD HAVE BEEN THE THOUGHT "THAT I SHOULD SOMEDAY BE PLUNGED INTO ROMANCES AND LOVE WITH WHITE WOMEN "IN DEFIANCE OF A TREASURED AND GUARDED CUSTOM. "HOW FAR REMOVED FROM MY THOUGHT THEN WAS THE POSSIBILITY "THAT TRAGEDY WOULD CREEP INTO MY LIFE. "I DO NOT RECALL THESE THINGS IN A BOASTFUL SPIRIT "BECAUSE SOME OF THEM BRING SAD MEMORIES "THAT AROUSE REGRETS. BUT THEY HAVE HAPPENED, AND THEY MUST BE TOLD." JACK JOHNSON. [RINGSIDE BELL RINGS, CROWD CHEERING] [PUNCHES LANDING, MEN GRUNTING] Man: HE WOULDN'T LET ANYBODY DEFINE HIM. HE WAS A SELF-DEFINED MAN, AND THE ISSUE OF HIS BEING BLACK WAS NOT THAT RELEVANT TO HIM, BUT THE ISSUE OF HIS BEING FREE AND A TOTAL PERSON WAS VERY RELEVANT. SO WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM, HE WALKED OUT INTO A WORLD THAT WAS NOT READY TO RECEIVE A BLACK MAN AS A TOTAL PERSON. AND HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO FUNCTION OTHERWISE. YOU GOT TO HAVE YOUR BALLS AND HEAD AND MIND AND HEART, EVERYTHING. YOU HAD TO WALK OUT AS THE SAME PERSON. AND THEY JUST WANTED HIS FISTS AND HIS OBEDIENCE TO THE SOCIAL MORES AND SO ON. HE COULDN'T DO THAT. JACK JOHNSON WAS ON THE TOP OF THE WORLD ATHLETICALLY AFTER HE BEAT JIM JEFFRIES. THERE WAS NO ONE ON THE HORIZON, SO JOHNSON HAD THE WORLD ALL TO HIMSELF. WHERE HE WAS VULNERABLE-- BECAUSE THE SOCIETY HE WAS LIVING IN NOW WAS REALLY OUT TO GET HIM, WHERE HE WAS VULNERABLE WAS HIS SEX LIFE, AND THIS IS WHERE SOCIETY DECIDED TO ATTACK HIM. THERE WERE BILLS IN CONGRESS INTRODUCED TO BAN FIGHT FILMS-- PARTICULARLY THIS ONE, BUT REALLY ALL OF THEM-- BECAUSE SHOWING IT WOULD ONCE AGAIN INITIATE RIOTS. THERE WERE ALL MANNER OF OUTPOURINGS OF DISGUST, DISTASTE, AND ANGER BY THE WHITE COMMUNITY BECAUSE THEIR CHAMPION-- "IT'S UP TO YOU, JEFF"-- JEFF WASN'T UP TO IT. AND NOW, IF THEY COULDN'T BEAT JOHNSON IN THE RING, THEY WERE GOING TO BEAT HIM SOMEHOW. THEY WERE GOING TO EXACT THEIR POUND OF FLESH. Man: THE ADVANTAGE THAT LIGHT-SKINNED PEOPLE HAD WITH WHITE PEOPLE WAS THAT, IF WHITE PEOPLE WOULD ACTUALLY LOOK AT THEM, THEY CAN SEE THEMSELVES. BUT JACK JOHNSON WAS A BIG, BLACK, DARK-SKINNED MAN. SEE, EXTREMELY DARK SKIN, BLACK GUYS IN PARTICULAR, EVERYBODY IS PUT OUT BY THEM, BECAUSE WHEN THEY COME ON THE SCENE, EVERYBODY TENDS TO FEEL THEY'RE IN THE PRESENCE OF SOMETHING ABORIGINAL. WITH SOMEBODY LIKE JACK JOHNSON, EVERYBODY WAS LIKE, "OH, NOW WE'RE BACK AT THE BEGINNING," AND SO I THINK THAT JOHNSON HAD THAT KIND OF POWER, TOO. Jones: THEY MUST HAVE ENJOYED IT. THEY MUST HAVE ENJOYED BEING SCARED. WE ALL GO TO SEE A HORROR MOVIE BECAUSE WE LIKE BEING SCARED. IT'S PART OF HUMAN NATURE, YOU KNOW: "GIVE ME A SCARY BOOGA BOOGA BEAR AND I'M GOING TO BE HAPPY." AND IT WASN'T JUST WHITE PEOPLE. THE DECENT BLACK FOLK DIDN'T WANT THEIR DAUGHTERS ASSOCIATING WITH HIM, SO HE COULDN'T HAVE A DATE WITH A SO-CALLED DECENT BLACK GIRL, WHATEVER THAT MEANT. BUT THE BLACK PEOPLE WERE-- THE SO-CALLED MIDDLE-CLASS BLACK PEOPLE--WERE SCARED OF HIM, TERRIFIED OF HIM, AS MUCH AS WHITE PEOPLE WERE. Man: "ADVICE TO JACK JOHNSON. "MR. JACK JOHNSON MUST CONDUCT HIMSELF IN A MODEST MANNER. "HE CAN HURT THE RACE IMMEASURABLY JUST NOW "IF HE GOES SPLURGING AND MAKING A USELESS, NOISY EXHIBITION OF HIMSELF. "WE HOPE THAT HE WILL NOT BE ARRESTED ON ANY CHARGE. "ANY UNDUE EXHIBITION ON THE PART OF MR. JOHNSON "WILL HURT EVERY MEMBER OF THE RACE. "ON THE OTHER HAND, "BECOMING MODESTY AND SELF-CONTROL WILL WIN HIM MANY FRIENDS." THE "NEW YORK AGE." Narrator: MODESTY WAS NEVER PART OF JACK JOHNSON'S MAKEUP. NEITHER WAS SELF-CONTROL. EVERYWHERE THE CHAMPION WENT, TROUBLE NOW SEEMED TO FOLLOW; SOME OF IT STIRRED UP BY HIS ENEMIES, SOME OF HIS OWN MAKING. TWO EX-MANAGERS WERE SUING HIM FOR BACK PAY, AND ONE WAS CHARGING THAT HIS FIGHTS WITH STANLEY KETCHEL AND JIM JEFFRIES HAD BOTH BEEN FIXED. IN AUGUST 1910, HE TOOK HIS MOST FREQUENT COMPANION, THE ELEGANT BUT TROUBLED ETTA DURYEA, TO ATLANTIC CITY. BELLE SCHREIBER, AND SEVERAL OTHER PROSTITUTES AND SPORTING WOMEN, CAME ALONG, TOO, FOR A WEEK OF ALL-NIGHT PARTIES. THEN HE RETURNED TO VAUDEVILLE TO HELP PAY FOR IT ALL. THE SHOWS HE APPEARED IN WERE AS FORGETTABLE AS HIS PERFORMANCES, BUT NOW, THERE WERE OFTEN BOOS AND RACIAL EPITHETS FROM THE AUDIENCE. WHEN HE STEPPED ON THE GAS LEAVING THE THEATER AFTER A MANHATTAN APPEARANCE TO AVOID STONES AND SHOUTS OF "COON" AND "NIGGER" HURLED AT HIM FROM THE SIDEWALK, THE POLICE ARRESTED HIM FOR SPEEDING. Man: "JOHNSON, WITH HIS EASYGOING WAYS "LOVE OF ADULATION, AND HANKERING FOR WHITE TRASH, "HAS BEEN LIVING IT UP ALMOST CONTINUOUSLY SINCE HIS RENO VICTORY. "BLACK FIGHTERS, ESPECIALLY, ARE PRONE TO FALL FOR THE SERVILE FLATTERY "OF THAT CLASS WHICH DELIGHTS TO FAWN UPON SUCCESSFUL GLADIATORS." "MILWAUKEE PRESS." Narrator: JOHNSON WAS DRINKING HEAVILY NOW. IN BOSTON, HE QUARRELS WITH BELLE SCHREIBER, TORE OFF HER CLOTHES, SLAPPED HER, AND THEY AGREED TO PART. A FEW WEEKS LATER, HE GOT A TELEGRAM FROM HER. SHE NEEDED HELP. SHE SAID SHE HAD LOST HER JOB IN A PITTSBURGH WHOREHOUSE, WHEN THE MADAM DISCOVERED SHE HAD BEEN JOHNSON'S LOVER. JOHNSON SENT HER MONEY FOR A TRAIN TICKET TO CHICAGO, THEN TRAVELED THERE BETWEEN VAUDEVILLE ENGAGEMENTS AND HELPED HER SET UP HER OWN PLACE OF BUSINESS, PAYING THE FIRST MONTH'S RENT AND BUYING ALL THE BEDS AND MATTRESSES. JOHNSON'S TOUR CONTINUED: ALBANY, RUTLAND, BINGHAMTON, WILKES-BARRE, SCRANTON. HIS LIFE WAS MOVING EVEN FASTER NOW, AND IT WAS TAKING ITS TOLL. WHEN HE REACHED PORTLAND, MAINE, IN NOVEMBER, HE WAS TOO DRUNK, TOO DESPONDENT, TO GO ONSTAGE. HE THREATENED TO JUMP OUT OF HIS HOTEL ROOM WINDOW. A DOCTOR WAS CALLED, DIAGNOSED HIM AS SUFFERING FROM AGGRAVATED NERVOUS EXHAUSTION, AND URGED HIM TO TAKE A LONG REST. HE HIRED A PRIVATE RAILROAD CAR INSTEAD, RETURNED TO THE ROAD, AND WAS ARRESTED AGAIN A FEW DAYS LATER, THIS TIME FOR HAVING MADE ADVANCES TO A CHORUS GIRL. HE PAID HIS BAIL WITH A THOUSAND-DOLLAR BILL. DEATH THREATS CAME REGULARLY IN THE MAIL. WHEN JOHNSON PLAYED PITTSBURGH, A WHITE SOUTHERNER NAMED BROOKS BUFFINGTON TURNED UP IN TOWN, INTENDING TO SHOOT HIM. WHEN HE COULDN'T GET TO THE CHAMPION, HE MURDERED ANOTHER BLACK MAN INSTEAD. IN CHICAGO, ON CHRISTMAS DAY, JOHNSON EXPLODED. HE BEAT ETTA DURYEA-- BEAT HER SO BADLY, SHE HAD TO BE HOSPITALIZED. HE TOLD THE DOCTOR SHE HAD FALLEN FROM A STREETCAR. SHE WENT ALONG WITH THE STORY, LEFT THE HOSPITAL ON NEW YEAR'S DAY, AND LATER RECONCILED WITH HER LOVER. Man: THERE WAS ABUSE. CERTAINLY, THERE WAS ABUSE. AND I THINK HE INTERNALIZED PRESSURE. HE DIDN'T SHOW IT. HE DIDN'T SHOW IT PUBLICLY. I THINK HE SHOWED IT WITH ETTA, THOUGH, AND SO ETTA'S LIFE, I THINK, WAS PRETTY MISERABLE. AND SO, IF SHE THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE HAPPY, SHE'S WRONG. Narrator: ON JANUARY 18, 1911, JACK JOHNSON AND ETTA DURYEA WERE QUIETLY MARRIED IN PITTSBURGH. [JAZZ TRUMPET PLAYING] Man: "WHERE NOW IS THE CHAMPION "WHO WILL MAKE JOHNSON EXTEND HIMSELF, "WHO WILL GLAZE THOSE BRIGHT EYES, "REMOVE THAT SMILE, AND SILENCE THAT GOLDEN REPARTEE?" JACK LONDON. Narrator: THE SEARCH FOR A NEW WHITE HOPE CONTINUED. ONE NEW YORK PROMOTER ORGANIZED A ROUND ROBIN TOURNAMENT TO NAME A WORLD'S WHITE CHAMPION. JOHNSON SAT AT RINGSIDE, TRYING TO KEEP FROM LAUGHING, AS A SERIES OF BIG, POORLY TRAINED WHITE CHALLENGERS POUNDED AWAY AT ONE ANOTHER. WAS HE LEARNING ANYTHING? A REPORTER ASKED HIM. "LEARNING PLENTY," HE ANSWERED. "NONE OF THEM WAS WORTH FIGHTING." HE SAW NO REASON TO ACCEPT CHALLENGES FROM BLACK BOXERS, EITHER. THERE WAS NO MONEY IN IT. "I'M GOING TO DRAW THE COLOR LINE, LIKE SOME OTHERS," HE SAID. Sugar: AND PART OF THE REASON THAT JOHNSON PULLED HIS OWN COLOR LINE AS CHAMPION WAS THE WHITES WERE SO EASY TO FIGHT. THE BLACKS WERE THE TOUGH ONES. HE DIDN'T WANT TO FIGHT A JOE JEANNETTE, A SAM LANGFORD, AGAIN, A SAM McVEY AGAIN. IN FACT, WHEN SAM LANGFORD CAME TO HIM, WHO CHASED HIM TO ENGLAND FOR A SHOT AT THE CHAMPIONSHIP, HE SAID, "SAM, THE WORLD DOESN'T WANT TO SEE TWO BLACK MEN FIGHT FOR THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP." WHAT HE WAS SAYING WAS THERE ARE EASIER PICKINGS OUT THERE. Narrator: IN JULY OF 1912, JOHNSON TOOK ON FIREMAN JIM FLYNN, WHOM HE HAD ALREADY KNOCKED OUT ONCE. FLYNN VOWED TO BRING THE TITLE BACK TO THE WHITE RACE. "IF I LOSE TO THIS NIGGER," HE TOLD HIS MANAGER, "SHOOT ME." JOHNSON BARELY BOTHERED TO TRAIN. [RINGSIDE BELL RINGS] IT DIDN'T MATTER. THIS TIME, FLYNN, FRUSTRATED BY JOHNSON'S ABILITY TO SMOTHER HIM, USED HIS SKULL AS A WEAPON. Man: "FLYNN'S FEET WERE BOTH OFF THE FLOOR TIME AND AGAIN "WITH THE ENERGY HE PUT INTO HIS BOUNCES. "SOMETIMES HE SEEMED TO LEAP TWO FEET INTO THE AIR, IN FRANTIC PLUNGES AT THE ELUSIVE JAW ABOVE HIM." Narrator: JOHNSON CONTINUED TO TOY WITH FLYNN, UNTIL AN OFFICIAL WITH A REVOLVER STEPPED IN TO STOP IT IN THE NINTH ROUND. JOHNSON WAS DECLARED THE WINNER. NO ONE SHOT FLYNN. THE IDEA THAT FILMS OF A JOHNSON VICTORY OVER STILL ANOTHER WHITE OPPONENT WERE ABOUT TO BE SEEN BY MOVIEGOERS ALL OVER AMERICA WAS TOO MUCH FOR MOST CONGRESSMEN. ON JULY 31, 1912, CONGRESS ENACTED A LAW THAT BARRED THE INTERSTATE SHIPMENT OF ALL FIGHT FILMS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. BY THEN, THE REAL TARGET OF THE BILL WAS BACK IN CHICAGO, WHERE HE HAD OPENED HIS OWN NIGHTCLUB, THE CAFE DE CHAMPION, JUST SOUTH OF THE LEVEE VICE DISTRICT. IT WAS A BLACK AND TAN CLUB, ONE OF THE FEW PLACES IN THE CITY WHERE PEOPLE OF ALL COLORS COULD GET TOGETHER AFTER DARK. Man: "THE CAFE DE CHAMPION, BOTH ON THE MAIN AND SECOND FLOORS, "WAS CROWDED TO ITS FULLEST CAPACITY WITH MEN AND WOMEN OF BOTH RACES, MIXED IN TOGETHER." "JACK JOHNSON, WITHOUT ANY QUESTION ABOUT IT, "IS SMOOTH GOODS, "AND HE IS DOING HIS PART IN HIS OWN WAY "IN HELPING TO SOLVE THE RACE PROBLEM. "MANY VERY BEAUTIFUL PICTURES HANG ON THE WALLS, "INCLUDING THE LIFE-SIZE PICTURE OF MR. AND MRS. JOHNSON, WHICH IS ENCASED IN A FINE AND VERY HEAVY GOLD FRAME." THE "CHICAGO BROAD AX." Narrator: ETTA JOHNSON'S PORTRAIT WAS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE CLUB'S DECOR. BUT SHE HERSELF REMAINED A SORT OF PRISONER, CONFINED TO AN APARTMENT UPSTAIRS. Roberts: I THINK SHE WAS A VERY LONELY PERSON. CERTAINLY, SHE WAS OSTRACIZED BY WHITE AMERICA. BLACK AMERICA DIDN'T LIKE HER ANY MORE. THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE, MANY BLACK AMERICANS, WHO WERE ALSO VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH JACK JOHNSON ONLY GOING OUT WITH WHITE WOMEN. SO ETTA WAS LONELY, JACK JOHNSON WAS HEROICALLY UNFAITHFUL. IT'S NOT A VERY ATTRACTIVE LIFE. AND IN THE END, SHE COULDN'T TAKE IT. Narrator: ETTA'S DEPRESSION DEEPENED. "I AM A WHITE WOMAN, AND TIRED OF BEING AN OUTCAST," SHE TOLD ONE OF HER MAIDS THAT SUMMER. "EVEN THE NEGROES DON'T RESPECT ME. THEY HATE ME." THEN, HER FATHER DIED. SHE FELT MORE ISOLATED THAN EVER. Woman: "CHICAGO, AUGUST 12, 1912. "MY DEAR MOTHER, "I AM WRITING THIS, "AND I'M GOING TO HAVE JACK PUT IT IN HIS SAFE, "SO IF ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN TO ME, THERE WILL BE NO HARD FEELINGS LEFT BEHIND ME." "I WOULD SEND THIS LETTER TO YOU, "ONLY I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU WORRY, "AND I DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW HOW SICK I REALLY AM. "JACK HAS DONE ALL IN HIS POWER TO CURE ME, "BUT IT IS NO USE. "SINCE PAPA'S DEATH, "I WORRIED MYSELF INTO MY GRAVE. "I HAVEN'T BEEN WORRYING ABOUT PAPA'S LOSS; ONLY OVER SOME HORRIBLE DREAD, I DON'T KNOW WHAT." "I WANT TO BE BURIED HERE IN CHICAGO. LET ME REST FOR ONCE." "WITH LOVE AND ALWAYS THE SWEETEST TO YOU, I AM YOUR LOVING DAUGHTER, ETTA." Narrator: JOHNSON HOPED TO LIFT HIS WIFE'S SPIRITS BY SENDING HER AND A FRIEND ON A VACATION ON THE EVENING OF SEPTEMBER 11. AT THE LAST MOMENT, SHE TOLD HIM SHE DIDN'T FEEL WELL ENOUGH TO GO. JOHNSON HURRIED TO THE RAILROAD STATION TO CHANGE THE TICKETS. WHEN HE GOT BACK, ABOUT 10:30, A LARGE CROWD HAD GATHERED OUTSIDE THE CAFE. HE PUSHED HIS WAY THROUGH AND RAN UP THE STAIRS. ETTA'S HORRIBLE DREAD HAD FINALLY OVERWHELMED HER. ALONE IN THE APARTMENT, SHE HAD DRESSED FOR BED, ASKED HER MAIDS TO PRAY FOR HER, THEN CLOSED AND LOCKED THE DOOR. MOMENTS LATER, ONE OF THE MAIDS HEARD A SHOT. THE CAFE BARTENDER BROKE DOWN THE DOOR AND FOUND HER DYING ON THE FLOOR. JOHNSON COLLAPSED WITH GRIEF. HE TOLD A CORONER'S INQUEST THAT HE HAD HIMSELF SOMETIMES FELT SUICIDAL SINCE WINNING THE TITLE, THAT ETTA HAD WORN HERSELF DOWN SEEKING TO CONSOLE HIM, THAT SHE AND HE HAD GENUINELY LOVED ONE ANOTHER. Man: "WHILE IT CANNOT BE SAID "THAT JOHNSON WILL HAVE ANYTHING LIKE GENERAL PUBLIC SYMPATHY "BECAUSE HIS VENTURE IN MISCEGENATION HAS COME TO AN END, "STILL, HIS APPARENTLY SINCERE GRIEF "OVER THE SUICIDE OF THE WHITE WOMAN WHO MARRIED HIM WILL HAVE ITS EFFECT IN MITIGATING JUDGMENT OF HIM." "IT AT LEAST SHOWS THAT HE IS NOT THE ENTIRELY CALLOUS ANIMAL "THAT A NEGRO PRIZE FIGHTER IS SUPPOSED BY MOST TO BE. "HIS DISPLAY OF EMOTION MAY BE RACIAL RATHER THAN PERSONAL, "BUT, ANIMAL OR NOT, HE IS NOT CALLOUS." THE "NEW YORK TIMES." Crouch: WELL, SEE, I THINK JACK JOHNSON EMBODIED THE AMERICAN IDEA OF BEING ABLE TO GO WHERE YOU WANT TO GO ON THE BASIS OF YOUR ABILITY. NO ONE WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT JACK JOHNSON IF HE COULDN'T FIGHT. THAT'S NUMBER ONE. [MEN GRUNTING, CROWD CHEERING] NUMBER TWO... [RINGSIDE BELL RINGS] NO ONE WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT JACK JOHNSON IF, BESIDES BEING ABLE TO FIGHT, HE HAD DECIDED TO LIVE A LIFE SHORT OF THE LIFE OF A FREE MAN, WHICH MEANT THAT HE MADE PEOPLE UPSET BECAUSE THEY HAD A MORE CIRCUMSCRIBED IDEA ABOUT WHAT INDIVIDUAL FREEDOMS SHOULD HAVE BEEN FOR HIM. Man: "TO THE U.S. DISTRICT ATTORNEY, "CHICAGO, ILLINOIS. "HAVING FOLLOWED WITH KEEN INTEREST THE EFFORT OF THE GOVERNMENT STAFF "TO GATHER SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE AGAINST JACK JOHNSON, NEGRO PRIZE FIGHTER, "AND APPRECIATIVE OF THE FACT THAT THE SOONER THE COUNTRY IS RID OF HIM, "THE BETTER PROTECTED OUR WOMEN SHALL BE, "I AM PROMPTED HEREWITH TO GIVE YOU CERTAIN FACTS WHICH I TRUST SHALL AID YOU IN YOUR INVESTIGATION." Man as Johnson: "THE SEARCH FOR THE WHITE HOPE NOT HAVING BEEN SUCCESSFUL, "PREJUDICES WERE BEING PILED UP AGAINST ME. "AND CERTAIN UNFAIR PERSONS, PIQUED BECAUSE I WAS CHAMPION, "DECIDED IF THEY COULD NOT GET ME ONE WAY, THEY WOULD ANOTHER." Narrator: TWO YEARS EARLIER, A NEW FEDERAL LAW HAD GONE INTO EFFECT. THE MANN ACT WAS NAMED FOR ITS SPONSOR, ILLINOIS REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN JAMES ROBERT MANN. IT BARRED THE TRANSPORTATION OF WOMEN IN INTERSTATE OR FOREIGN COMMERCE FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROSTITUTION OR DEBAUCHERY, OR FOR ANY OTHER IMMORAL PURPOSE. A LANDMARK OF PROGRESSIVE-ERA LEGISLATION, THE MANN ACT WAS INTENDED TO STOP THE LURING OF YOUNG WOMEN INTO PROSTITUTION-- WHAT WAS CALLED "THE WHITE SLAVE TRAFFIC," NOT PRIVATE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CONSENTING ADULTS. BUT OFFICIALS OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SAW IN IT THEIR CHANCE TO DESTROY JACK JOHNSON. BY OCTOBER OF 1912, JOHNSON HAD A NEW COMPANION-- A 19-YEAR-OLD PROSTITUTE FROM MILWAUKEE NAMED LUCILE CAMERON. WHEN HER MOTHER, MRS. F. CAMERON-FALCONET, CAME TO CHICAGO AND WENT TO THE POLICE, CHARGING JOHNSON WITH ABDUCTING HER DAUGHTER, THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION AGREED TO TAKE THE CASE. "JACK JOHNSON HAS HYPNOTIC POWERS," MRS. CAMERON-FALCONET ASSURED THE PRESS, "AND HE HAS EXERCISED THEM ON MY LITTLE GIRL. "I WOULD RATHER SEE MY DAUGHTER SPEND THE REST OF HER LIFE IN AN INSANE ASYLUM THAN SEE HER THE PLAYTHING OF A NIGGER." HER LAWYER SAID THAT BY HAVING A RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS CLIENT'S DAUGHTER, JACK JOHNSON HAD INSULTED EVERY WHITE WOMAN IN THE UNITED STATES. Roberts: THE MANN ACT. IT WAS NEVER AIMED AT AN INDIVIDUAL HAVING A LIAISON WITH A SECRETARY GOING FROM NEW YORK TO HOBOKEN. IT WAS AIMED AT COMMERCIALIZED VICE. AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF AMERICA--A MAN BY THE NAME OF WICKERSHAM--KNEW THIS, AND WHEN HE WAS FIRST APPROACHED TO USE THIS AGAINST JACK JOHNSON, HE UNDERSTOOD THAT "WE CAN'T DO THIS, THAT THIS IS A TRAVESTY." BUT EVENTUALLY, WICKERSHAM WAS CONVINCED TO GO AFTER JACK JOHNSON, TO PERVERT THE LAW. Narrator: ON OCTOBER 18, 1912, CHICAGO POLICE ARRESTED JOHNSON FOR VIOLATING THE MANN ACT. Early: THE "UNITED STATES VS. JACK JOHNSON" DECIDED TO ATTACK HIM ON THE BASIS OF THE SEX LIFE AND THE MISCEGENATION. MISCEGENATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN A... A PREOCCUPATION AND A FIXATION IN THE MIND OF WHITE AMERICA. BLACK MEN WITH WHITE WOMEN-- THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN A CONCERN. Crouch: I THINK THAT IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT THE SOUTH DID AFTER IT LOST THE CIVIL WAR. IT LOST THE SHOOTING WAR, BUT EVENTUALLY, IT WON THE POLICY WAR. IT WAS ABLE TO KEEP THE CONSTITUTION FROM FUNCTIONING BELOW THE MASON-DIXON LINE, SO THIS IS A VARIATION ON THE WAY THAT THE SOUTH WON AFTER THEY LOST. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED WITH JACK JOHNSON. "WE CAN'T FIND ANYBODY TO BEAT HIM, SO WE'LL JUST DO WHAT WE HAVE DONE BEFORE," WHICH IS JUST TURN THE LAW AGAINST HIM. Narrator: JOHNSON WAS RELEASED ON $800 BAIL BY NIGHTFALL. LUCILE CAMERON WAS LOCKED UP, TOO, AND WHEN JOHNSON WENT TO THE BANK TO GET $25,000 WITH WHICH TO TRY TO BAIL HER OUT, AN ANGRY MOB GATHERED OUTSIDE. [POLICE WHISTLE] THERE WERE SHOUTS OF "LYNCH HIM!" AND JOHNSON HAD TO TAKE REFUGE INSIDE HIS OWN CAFE. A FEW DAYS LATER, THE CITY COLLECTOR PADLOCKED THE CAFE DE CHAMPION AND CANCELED ITS LICENSE, DECLARING JOHNSON "AN UNDESIRABLE PERSON" AND "A BAD CHARACTER." Man as Johnson: "SO LONG AS I DO NOT INTERFERE WITH ANY OTHER MAN'S WIFE, "I SHALL CLAIM THE RIGHT TO SELECT THE WOMAN "OF MY OWN CHOICE. "NOBODY ELSE CAN DO THAT FOR ME. "I AM NOT A SLAVE, "AND I HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE WHO MY MATE SHALL BE "WITHOUT THE DICTATION OF ANY MAN. "I HAVE EYES AND I HAVE A HEART, "AND WHEN THEY FAIL TO TELL ME WHO I SHALL HAVE AS MINE, I WANT TO BE PUT IN A LUNATIC ASYLUM." Narrator: AND NOW, AS JOHNSON HAD ALWAYS FEARED, SOME AFRICAN-AMERICANS BEGAN TO ABANDON HIM. Man: "OCTOBER 26, 1912. "IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT A MAN WITH MONEY SHOULD USE IT "IN A WAY TO INJURE HIS OWN PEOPLE, "IN THE EYES OF THOSE WHO ARE SEEKING TO UPLIFT HIS RACE "AND IMPROVE ITS CONDITIONS. "I WISH TO SAY EMPHATICALLY "THAT JACK JOHNSON'S ACTIONS DID NOT MEET MY PERSONAL APPROVAL, "AND I AM SURE THAT THEY DO NOT MEET WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE COLORED RACE. MAN WITH MUSCLE MINUS BRAINS IS A USELESS CREATURE." BOOKER T. WASHINGTON. Roberts: I THINK THERE ARE 3 BLACK LEADERS IN THE FIRST COUPLE DECADES OF THE 20th CENTURY. ONE IS BOOKER T. WASHINGTON, WHO HAS A MESSAGE SAYING, "HUNKER DOWN, GET EDUCATION, "WORK HARD, SAVE YOUR MONEY, BE RELIABLE. DON'T WORRY ABOUT SOCIAL JUSTICE, NECESSARILY, OR SOCIAL ADVANCEMENT." ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE W.E.B. DU BOIS, WHO STANDS FOR, "WE WANT SOCIAL EQUALITY, WE WANT ECONOMIC EQUALITY, WE WANT ADVANCEMENT ON ALL LEVELS." AND THEN THERE'S JACK JOHNSON THAT SAYS, "I'M GETTING MINE." BUT HE STANDS FOR PURE INDIVIDUALISM, EGOISM. Man: "I DO NOT LOOK UPON JACK JOHNSON AS A RACE LEADER, "NOR DO I IN ANY WAY ENDORSE HIS LIFE AND MANNERISMS, "FOR IT WILL NOT PAY ANYONE TO FOLLOW IT. "BUT THE WHOLE WORLD IS UPON HIM TODAY. "BEHIND IT ALL, YOU CAN SEE A LARGE DEGREE OF RACE PREJUDICE. "HE GOT MIXED UP WITH WHITE WOMEN. "WAY DOWN IN HIS HEART, HE HAS A CRAVING FOR MISS ANN. "AND THAT DOES NOT LAY WELL ON THE STOMACH OF THE WHITE MAN, "HENCE HE HAS BEEN ARRESTED AND HIS CASE THROWN ON THE CANVAS, SO TO SPEAK, "AND THE WHOLE WORLD THROWS UP ITS HANDS AND CRIES, BEHOLD THE BRUTE. LET US CRUCIFY HIM." "BALTIMORE AFRO-AMERICAN." Man: "MISS CAMERON DENIES THAT SHE HAS BEEN INTIMATE "WITH JACK JOHNSON OR ANY OTHER PERSON. "HER APPEARANCE, HOWEVER, BELIES THAT STATEMENT, "AS SHE DRESSES IN THE HEIGHT OF FASHION, WEARING A HAT SAID TO HAVE COST $150." AGENT M.J. LINZ, BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION. Narrator: DESPITE HER MOTHER'S CHARGES, LUCILE CAMERON REFUSED TO COOPERATE WITH THE PROSECUTORS. CALLED BEFORE THE GRAND JURY, SHE SAID SHE LOVED AND WISHED TO MARRY JOHNSON. THEN, SHE COLLAPSED IN TEARS. WITHOUT HER HELP, THERE WAS NO CASE. BUT THAT DID NOT STOP EITHER THE STATE OR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THEY WERE DETERMINED TO GET JACK JOHNSON ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. THE WHITE PUBLIC NOW DEMANDED IT. ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY HARRY A. PARKIN CALLED UPON THE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION OF THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO HELP BUILD A NEW CASE BY SENDING ITS AGENTS OUT TO SECURE EVIDENCE AS TO ILLEGAL TRANSPORTATION BY JOHNSON OF ANY WOMAN FOR IMMORAL PURPOSES. [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS] FEDERAL AGENTS FANNED OUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY, LOOKING INTO ANONYMOUS TIPS, INTERVIEWING PROSTITUTES, CHAUFFEURS, WAITERS, BELLHOPS, PULLMAN PORTERS, EX-MANAGERS, FORMER SPARRING PARTNERS, FISHING FOR SOMETHING, ANYTHING, THAT MIGHT BE USED TO SUGGEST THAT THE CHAMPION HAD DEFIED FEDERAL LAW. [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS] Woman: "OCTOBER 31, 1912. "I, BELLE SCHREIBER, ALIAS BELLE GILBERT, "ALIAS BELLE LESLIE, ALIAS MRS. J.A. GILBERT, "ALIAS LESLIE ALLEN, ALIAS MRS. JACK JOHNSON, FIRST BEING DULY SWORN TO POSE..." Man as Johnson: "MY ENEMIES HAD NEVER CEASED THEIR ACTIVITIES. "WHEN THEY COULD FIND NOTHING INVOLVING ME IMPROPERLY WITH MISS CAMERON, "THEY HIT ON AN OLD TRADE, "AND, LEARNING OF MY ASSOCIATION WITH BELLE SCHREIBER, "HUNTED HER DOWN. "SHE WAS BROUGHT FROM WASHINGTON "AND SET UP AS THE ACCUSING WITNESS AGAINST ME. Narrator: THE GOVERNMENT'S NEW CHIEF WITNESS TURNED OUT TO BE JOHNSON'S EX-LOVER, BELLE SCHREIBER-- TRACKED TO A WASHINGTON, D.C. WHOREHOUSE, THEN PLACED UNDER PROTECTIVE CUSTODY BY THE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION AND THREATENED WITH IMPRISONMENT IF SHE DID NOT COOPERATE. EMBITTERED BY JOHNSON'S TREATMENT OF HER, PERHAPS ENVIOUS OF LUCILE CAMERON FOR HAVING DISPLACED HER IN HIS AFFECTIONS, SCHREIBER WOULD BE A DEVASTATING WITNESS AGAINST THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN HER PATRON AND ON-AND-OFF COMPANION FOR 4 YEARS. HER MEMORY FOR DATES AND PLACES SEEMED ENCYCLOPEDIC. Woman: "I FIRST MET JACK JOHNSON "AT THE EVERLEIGH CLUB IN CHICAGO. "JOHNSON SENT ME MONEY WITH THE UNDERSTANDING "THAT I WAS TO USE IT IN GOING TO NEW YORK, "AND ON MY ARRIVAL THERE, PROCEEDED TO THE LITTLE BELMONT HOTEL." "...THAT I HAD INTIMATE RELATIONS WITH JOHNSON IN THAT HOTEL." "...THAT FROM HERE, JOHNSON AND I WENT TO BOSTON..." Narrator: THE SPECIFIC CHARGE ON WHICH THE NEW INDICTMENTS WERE BASED WAS THAT ON AUGUST 10, 1910, A MONTH AFTER THE JEFFRIES FIGHT, JOHNSON HAD TRANSPORTED SCHREIBER FROM PITTSBURGH TO CHICAGO FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROSTITUTION AND DEBAUCHERY. ON NOVEMBER 7, CHICAGO POLICE KNOCKED DOWN THE DOOR OF ROOM 21 AT THE HOTEL VENDOME AND PLACED JACK JOHNSON UNDER ARREST. WHEN THEY PUT HIM IN HANDCUFFS, HIS EYES FILLED WITH TEARS. "YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS," HE SAID. "I WON'T RUN AWAY." Man as Johnson: "IT WAS A RANK FRAME-UP." "THE CHARGES WERE BASED UPON A LAW THAT WAS NOT IN EFFECT "AT THE TIME BELLE AND I HAD BEEN TOGETHER. "THE WHOLE ACCUSATION WAS UNFOUNDED, "AND I DO NOT HESITATE TO SAY THAT FRAUDULENT PRACTICES WERE ADOPTED. "SO BITTER AND INTENSE WAS THE FIGHT THAT HAD BEEN OPENED UP ON ME." Narrator: JUDGE KENNESAW MOUNTAIN LANDIS, WHO WOULD ONE DAY SERVE AS COMMISSIONER OF BASEBALL AND HELP ENSURE THAT THE PROFESSIONAL GAME REMAIN SEGREGATED, WAS ON THE BENCH WHEN JOHNSON WAS BROUGHT IN. AFTER JOHNSON'S BAIL BONDSMAN WAS FOUND TO HAVE MISREPRESENTED HIMSELF TO THE COURT, LANDIS LOCKED BOTH MEN IN THE COOK COUNTY JAIL. "I WILL NOT ACCEPT A CASH BOND," LANDIS SAID. "THERE IS A HUMAN CRY IN THIS CASE." JAILERS JEERED JOHNSON. ONE WHITE PRISONER SHOUTED HE'D LIKE TO KILL THE CHAMPION. IT TOOK A WEEK TO BAIL HIM OUT. Man: "CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, DECEMBER 4, 1912. "JACK JOHNSON AND LUCILE CAMERON, WHITE, "WERE MARRIED TUESDAY AFTERNOON AT THE HOME OF JOHNSON'S MOTHER IN THE CITY." DECEMBER, HE MARRIES LUCILE CAMERON. NOT GOOD TIMING, I DON'T THINK, ESPECIALLY SINCE HIS FIRST WIFE DIED IN SEPTEMBER. THIS JUST INTENSIFIES THE PUBLIC GOING AFTER HIM. Man: "NO BRUTALITY, NO INFAMY, "NO DEGRADATION IN ALL THE YEARS OF SOUTHERN SLAVERY "POSSESS SUCH VILLAINOUS CHARACTER AND SUCH ATROCIOUS QUALITIES "AS THE PROVISION OF THE LAWS OF ILLINOIS "WHICH ALLOWED A MARRIAGE OF THE NEGRO JACK JOHNSON TO A WOMAN OF CAUCASIAN STRAIN." S.A. RODDENBERRY. Narrator: ON DECEMBER 11, A GEORGIA CONGRESSMAN, SEABORN A. RODDENBERRY, INTRODUCED A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT BANNING MISCEGENATION, THE INTERMARRIAGE BETWEEN CAUCASIANS AND ANY AND ALL PERSONS OF AFRICAN DESCENT OR HAVING ANY TRACE OF AFRICAN BLOOD. THE AMENDMENT DID NOT PASS, BUT THE POISONOUS DEBATE WENT ON FOR WEEKS. Man as Seaborn: "INTERMARRIAGE BETWEEN WHITES AND BLACKS IS REPULSIVE AND AVERSE TO EVERY SENTIMENT OF PURE AMERICAN SPIRIT." "IT IS DESTRUCTIVE OF MORAL SUPREMACY, AND ULTIMATELY, "THIS SLAVERY OF WHITE WOMEN TO BLACK BEASTS "WILL BRING THIS NATION A CONFLICT AS FATAL AND AS BLOODY "AS EVER REDDENED THE SOIL OF VIRGINIA OR CRIMSONED THE MOUNTAIN PATHS OF PENNSYLVANIA." "LET US UPROOT AND EXTERMINATE NOW "THIS DEBASING, ULTRA-DEMORALIZING, UN-AMERICAN, AND INHUMAN LEPROSY." Man: "IN MARRYING MISS CAMERON, "JOHNSON HAS ACTED MORE HONORABLY THAN MANY OF THE WHITE GENTLEMEN "WHO ARE REARING OCTOROON FAMILIES ALONGSIDE THEIR LEGITIMATE OFFSPRING." THE "ST. LOUIS ARGUS." Crouch: THERE SEEMS TO HAVE NEVER BEEN MUCH OF A FEAR OF MISCEGENATION IF IT WAS A WHITE GUY WITH A BLACK WOMAN. THERE DIDN'T SEEM TOO MUCH FEAR ABOUT THAT. BUT THE IDEA THAT THE WHITE WOMAN MIGHT BE ATTRACTED TO A BLACK GUY WAS A DIFFERENT KIND OF A PHENOMENON. IF YOU HAD YOUR WAY, WOULDN'T YOU ELIMINATE ALL THE COMPETITION? SO--I MEAN, IN TERMS OF RACE, GET RID OF ALL THE BLACK GUYS, KEEP ALL THE WOMEN-- BLACK AND WHITE, RIGHT? THAT WOULD BE THE IDEAL. WELL, THAT KIND OF THING WAS GOING ON IN PEOPLE'S MINDS-- COMPETITION. Roberts: IT WAS A CONFLICT WITHIN WHITE WESTERN CULTURE AS A WHOLE. THE GREAT TABOO OF THOMAS JEFFERSON-- IT'S MISCEGENATION. THE GREAT LIE OF SLAVERY IS WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE ON THE PLANTATIONS IN THE SLAVE QUARTERS. JACK JOHNSON BRINGS THIS... DISEASE UNDER THE CARPET IN OTHER AGES AND BRINGS IT TO THE SURFACE. THE WHITE PRESS LOVES IT. NOTHING IS MORE DESIGNED TO ENRAGE A WHITE AMERICAN POWER STRUCTURE AS THAT. "JACK JOHNSON. LET'S GO AFTER HIM." THE BLACK PRESS IS DIFFERENT, AND EVEN IN THIS CASE, W.E.B. DU BOIS DEFENDS JACK JOHNSON, SAYING, "LOOK, I DISAGREE WITH JACK JOHNSON'S CHOICE OF MARRYING A WHITE WOMAN, "BUT HE HAS THAT RIGHT, AND WE CAN'T TAKE THAT RIGHT AWAY FROM HIM, AND HE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG." Man: "BOXING HAS FALLEN INTO DISFAVOR, "INTO VERY GREAT DISFAVOR. "THE CAUSE IS CLEAR. "JACK JOHNSON-- "NEITHER HE NOR HIS RACE INVENTED PRIZE FIGHTING, "OR PARTICULARLY LIKE IT. WHY, THEN, THIS THRILL OF NATIONAL DISGUST?" "BECAUSE JOHNSON IS BLACK. "OF COURSE, SOME PRETEND TO OBJECT TO MR. JOHNSON'S CHARACTER, "BUT WE HAVE YET TO HEAR IN THE CASE OF WHITE AMERICA "THAT MARITAL TROUBLES HAVE DISQUALIFIED PRIZE FIGHTERS OR BALL PLAYERS OR EVEN STATESMEN." "IT COMES DOWN, THEN, AFTER ALL, TO THIS... UNFORGIVABLE BLACKNESS." W.E.B. DU BOIS. ["HAIL TO THE CHIEF" PLAYING] Narrator: ON MARCH 4, 1913, GOVERNOR WOODROW WILSON OF NEW JERSEY WAS SWORN IN AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. HE HAD RUN FOR OFFICE PLEDGED TO JUSTICE FOR THE COLORED PEOPLE IN EVERY MATTER. NO DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HAD EVER SEEMED SO SYMPATHETIC TO AFRICAN-AMERICAN ASPIRATIONS. BUT ONCE IN POWER, THE SOUTHERN-BORN WILSON IMPOSED JIM CROW REGULATIONS ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ITSELF. WHITE AND BLACK CLERKS, WHO HAD WORKED SIDE-BY-SIDE SINCE THE CIVIL WAR, WERE SEPARATED. IF JACK JOHNSON HAD HOPED THE NEW ADMINISTRATION MIGHT BE LESS INCLINED TO PRESS THE GOVERNMENT'S CASE AGAINST HIM, HE WAS DISAPPOINTED. Roberts: I THINK JACK JOHNSON'S REACTION INITIALLY WAS, "THE MAN'S AFTER ME AGAIN. I CAN DEAL WITH IT." YOU KNOW, "I'VE DEALT WITH HIM IN THE RING, I'VE DEALT WITH HIM OUT OF THE RING." YOU KNOW, "IF I PUT MONEY IN ENOUGH PALMS, THIS WILL GO-- THIS, TOO, WILL PASS." IT'S ONLY GRADUALLY HE BECOMES AWARE OF WHAT'S TAKING PLACE, THAT THIS ISN'T GOING TO GO AWAY. Narrator: ON MAY 7, 1913, A LITTLE OVER TWO MONTHS AFTER WILSON'S INAUGURATION AND 10 MONTHS AFTER JOHNSON'S LAST FIGHT, THE CASE OF "THE UNITED STATES VS. JOHN ARTHUR JOHNSON" FINALLY BEGAN IN CHICAGO'S FEDERAL BUILDING. PRESIDING WAS JUDGE GEORGE ALBERT CARPENTER. BELLE SCHREIBER WAS A CHIEF WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION. HER RELATIONSHIP WITH JACK JOHNSON, SHE SAID, HAD RUINED HER LIFE. [GAVEL BANGING] Man: WERE YOU IN LOVE WITH HIM? Woman as Schreiber: I DON'T KNOW. DON'T YOU KNOW NOW? DID YOU THINK YOU WERE THEN? I DON'T KNOW WHAT LOVE IS. DID YOU GIVE YOURSELF UP TO THE DEFENDANT OUT OF AFFECTION OR FOR COMPENSATION? COMPENSATION, MOSTLY. YOU WERE NOT FORCED TO GO ON ANY ONE OF THOSE TRIPS? NO, NOT FORCED. YOU WERE NOT COERCED? I WAS ASKED TO GO. THAT WAS ALL. AND YOU ACCEDED TO THE REQUEST, DID YOU? YES. Narrator: SHE TESTIFIED THAT JOHNSON HAD TAKEN HER TO ATLANTIC CITY AND MANY OTHER PLACES FOR IMMORAL PURPOSES, AND HAD SET HER UP IN BUSINESS IN CHICAGO. A PARADE OF WITNESSES CORROBORATED MUCH OF HER TESTIMONY. WHEN JOHNSON FINALLY TOOK THE STAND IN HIS OWN DEFENSE, HE DENIED EVERYTHING. HE HAD NOT BEATEN ANYONE, HAD ONLY TAKEN ONE TRAIN TRIP WITH BELLE, LONG BEFORE PASSAGE OF THE MANN ACT, HAD GIVEN HER MONEY ONLY BECAUSE SHE SAID SHE'D LOST HER JOB AND NEEDED HELP. ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY PARKIN DID HIS BEST TO BREAK HIM DOWN. [GAVEL BANGING] Man as Parkin: NOW, WHY DID YOU HAVE BELLE COME TO ATLANTIC CITY? Man as Johnson: I NEVER HAD HER COME TO ATLANTIC CITY. YOU ENTERTAINED HER THERE? I WASN'T THERE LONG ENOUGH TO ENTERTAIN MYSELF. WHAT DID YOU DO THERE WITH HER? NOTHING. DID YOU BUY HER MEALS OR PAY HER HOTEL BILLS OR GIVE HER ANY MONEY? I NEVER GAVE HER NOTHING THAT TRIP AT ALL. [GALLERY MURMURING] DID YOU BUY HER MEALS? NEVER. NEVER EVEN BOUGHT HER A DRINK. SO SHE SPENT HER OWN MONEY AT THAT TIME? SHE MUST HAVE. SHE DIDN'T SPEND MINE. WELL, DID YOU HAVE SEXUAL RELATIONS IN ATLANTIC CITY? BELLE AND I WERE VERY FRIENDLY. JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION. DID YOU HAVE SEXUAL RELATIONS WITH HER IN ATLANTIC CITY? I DID NOT. IN AUGUST 1910? I DID NOT. BUT YOU DID IN EVERY TOWN WHERE YOU AND SHE WERE TOGETHER. I DON'T REMEMBER. I NEVER KEPT TAB. WELL, DID YOU SKIP ANY? HEH. CERTAINLY. EVERYBODY SKIPS. [GALLERY MURMURING, GAVEL BANGING] Narrator: "IF YOU SHOULD FIND THE DEFENDANT NOT GUILTY," THE PROSECUTOR TOLD THE JURY, "I DO NOT SEE HOW YOU COULD EVER LOOK SQUARELY IN THE FACES OF YOUR MOTHERS, WIVES, AND DAUGHTERS." THE ALL-WHITE JURY TOOK LESS THAN TWO HOURS TO REACH ITS VERDICT. JACK JOHNSON WAS GUILTY AS CHARGED. "THIS VERDICT WILL GO AROUND THE WORLD," THE PROSECUTOR SAID. "IT IS THE FORERUNNER OF LAWS TO BE PASSED IN THESE UNITED STATES "WHICH WE MAY LIVE TO SEE-- LAWS FORBIDDING MISCEGENATION." "THIS NEGRO, IN THE EYES OF MANY, "HAS BEEN PERSECUTED. "PERHAPS AS AN INDIVIDUAL, HE WAS, "BUT IT WAS HIS MISFORTUNE TO BE THE FOREMOST EXAMPLE OF THE EVIL IN PERMITTING THE INTERMARRIAGE OF WHITES AND BLACKS." FOR ONCE, JOHNSON HAD NOTHING TO SAY TO THE PRESS, BUT HE DID ATTACH AN ESPECIALLY NOISY CUT OUT MUFFLER TO ONE OF HIS CARS AND ROARED THROUGH THE STREETS OF CHICAGO UNTIL HE WAS FINED AGAIN FOR CREATING A PUBLIC NUISANCE. ON JUNE 4, 1913, JUDGE CARPENTER SENTENCED JACK JOHNSON TO A YEAR AND A DAY IN FEDERAL PRISON. JOHNSON WAS FREED PENDING AN APPEAL, BUT HE SAW NO REASON TO STICK AROUND. [NO AUDIO] Man, as Johnson: "FRIENDS TO WHOM I CONFIDED MY INTENTION OF ESCAPING SAID IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE." "THERE WAS NEVER A MOMENT THAT FEDERAL AGENTS "WERE NOT WITHIN REACH OF ME. "THEY HUNG CLOSE ABOUT MY HOME, AND FOLLOWED ME EVERY STEP THROUGH THE STREETS." "EVERY TIME MY CAR TURNED A WHEEL, "THEY WERE AWARE OF IT. TO ELUDE THEM SEEMED AN IMPOSSIBLE FEAT." Narrator: AS JOHNSON TOLD THE STORY, HE ENLISTED THE AID RUBE FOSTER, THE GREAT PITCHER MANAGER OF FOSTER'S GIANTS-- AN ALL-BLACK BASEBALL TEAM-- WHO ALLOWED HIM TO BOARD THEIR TRAIN DRESSED IN A TEAM UNIFORM AS IT LEFT CHICAGO FOR A TOUR OF THE NORTHEAST. SINCE THE WHITE OFFICERS PATROLLING THE DEPOT COULDN'T TELL ONE BIG BLACK MAN FROM ANOTHER, HE'D BEEN ABLE TO SLIP OUT OF TOWN. THE OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT VERSION WAS THAT HE HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO GO FISHING IN INDIANA, THEN SOMEHOW DRIVEN NORTH TO CANADA BEFORE THEY COULD STOP HIM. LATER, JOHNSON'S MOTHER AND SISTER WOULD TELL STILL ANOTHER STORY. THE FEDERAL OFFICIALS IN CHARGE OF THE PROSECUTION, THEY SAID, HAD ACCEPTED THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN BRIBES FROM JOHNSON TO LET HIM GO. EVEN THE CHAMPION'S ATTORNEY HAD BEEN IN ON IT, THEY CHARGED. "WE'LL FLEECE THAT NIGGER BEFORE WE GET THROUGH WITH HIM," THE LAWYER WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE SAID. THERE WAS AN INVESTIGATION, BUT NO ONE WAS EVER CHARGED. HOWEVER HE DID IT, JACK JOHNSON GOT AWAY CLEAN. ON JUNE 25, HE SUDDENLY TURNED UP IN MONTREAL, WHERE LUCILE WAS ALREADY WAITING FOR HIM. Man, as Johnson: "THERE ARE FEW COUNTRIES IN WHICH I HAVE NOT TRAVELED. "I HAVE RUBBED ELBOWS WITH THE ARISTOCRATS OF THE EUROPEAN CAPITALS. "I HAVE DISBOARDED ON THE FRENCH AND ITALIAN RIVERA. "I HAVE BEEN A GUEST IN SOME OF THE FINEST HOMES OF MAYFAIR. "IN MOSCOW, MY ASSOCIATES WERE RUSSIAN FIELD MARSHALS AND AIDES OF CZAR NICHOLAS. "I HAVE WITNESSED SCENES THAT HAVE NO PARALLEL, EVEN IN THE IMAGINATIVE FICTION OF MELODRAMATIC WRITERS." Narrator: JACK JOHNSON HAD BEEN A CELEBRITY ON HIS EARLIER TRIPS TO EUROPE, BUT NOW HE WAS A FUGITIVE FROM JUSTICE. IN PARIS, THE GRAND HOTEL DENIED HIM A ROOM-- SO DID THE RITZ, THE ELYSEE, THE PALACE, AND THE EXCELSIOR. IN LONDON, BRITISH MUSICAL PERFORMERS REFUSED TO APPEAR ON STAGE WITH HIM. SWEDEN BARRED HIM ALTOGETHER. HIS MONEY BEGAN TO RUN OUT. "MY REAL CRIME," JOHNSON SAID, "WAS BEATING JIM JEFFRIES." TO PAY HIS CREDITORS, JOHNSON AGREED TO ANOTHER FIGHT. ON THE NIGHT OF JUNE 27, 1914, HE TOOK ON A BRAWLER FROM PITTSBURGH NAMED FRANK MORAN AT THE VELODROME D'HIVER IN PARIS. IT WAS WIDELY RUMORED THAT THE FIGHT HAD BEEN RIGGED TO LAST LONG ENOUGH TO ENSURE THE HEFTY PROFITS THE TWO MEN PLANNED TO MAKE FROM SHOWING THE FIGHT FILMS IN EUROPE. JOHNSON WAS NEVER IN ANY TROUBLE. WHEN MORAN MANAGED TO GET IN ONE GOOD PUNCH, JOHNSON GRINNED AND APPLAUDED. "MY SINCERE CONGRATULATIONS, FRANK," HE SAID. BUT WHEN 20 LACKLUSTER ROUNDS WENT BY WITHOUT HIS HAVING DONE MUCH DAMAGE TO HIS OUTCLASSED OPPONENT, THE FRENCH CROWD ROARED ITS DISAPPROVAL. HUNDREDS WALKED OUT. JOHNSON NEVER SAW A CENT. Roberts: BY THE TIME THE FIGHT WAS OVER, IT WAS JUNE 28, 1914. THAT VERY AFTERNOON, ARCHDUKE FRANCIS FERDINAND WILL BE ASSASSINATED IN SARAJEVO AND WE WILL START THAT QUICK DESCENT INTO WORLD WAR I, THE GREAT WAR. WITH WAR IN EUROPE, JACK JOHNSON'S OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE MONEY ARE AT A STANDSTILL. IT'S OVER. ON FEBRUARY 18, 1915, THE DIRECTOR D.W. GRIFFITH SHOWED HIS EPIC FILM "BIRTH OF A NATION" AT THE WHITE HOUSE. NO MOVIE HAD EVER BEEN SHOWN THERE BEFORE, AND PRESIDENT WILSON, HIS ENTIRE CABINET, AND ALL THE JUSTICES OF THE SUPREME COURT WERE IN ATTENDANCE. "BIRTH OF A NATION" OFFERED AN UPSIDE DOWN VERSION OF RECONSTRUCTION IN WHICH THE TERRORIST NIGHT RIDERS OF THE KU KLUX KLAN WERE PORTRAYED AS HEROES, WHILE, AS W.E.B. DU BOIS WROTE, "THE FREED MAN WAS REPRESENTED EITHER AS AN IGNORANT FOOL, "A VICIOUS RAPIST, "A VENAL OR UNSCRUPULOUS POLITICIAN, OR A FAITHFUL, BUT DODDERING IDIOT." AS A FURTHER INSULT, THE MAIN BLACK CHARACTERS WERE PORTRAYED BY WHITE ACTORS IN BLACKFACE. THE DISTINGUISHED AUDIENCE LOVED IT. "IT IS LIKE WRITING HISTORY WITH LIGHTNING," PRESIDENT WILSON SAID WHEN THE LIGHTS CAME ON AGAIN, "AND MY ONLY REGRET IS THAT IT IS ALL SO TERRIBLY TRUE." CHIEF JUSTICE EDWARD WHITE AGREED. HE HAD HIMSELF RIDDEN WITH THE CLAN. MILLIONS OF WHITE AMERICANS ALREADY SHARED THEIR VIEW. THE FLEDGING NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED PEOPLE MOUNTED A NATIONAL CAMPAIGN TO BAN THE FILM, AND ONLY SUCCEEDED IN PUBLICIZING IT. "BIRTH OF A NATION" OPENED AT THE LIBERTY THEATER ON BROADWAY THE FOLLOWING MONTH, BEGINNING A RECORD RUN OF 44 WEEKS. IT WOULD BECOME THE MOST-SEEN MOVIE OF ITS TIME. MISCEGENATION WAS THE SUPPOSED EVIL AT THE HEART OF ITS STORY, AND ITS MORAL WAS THAT EVERY SELF-RESPECTING WHITE MAN HAD A DUTY TO AVENGE IT IF HE COULD. ON APRIL 5, 1915, WHITE AMERICANS WOULD FINALLY GET THEIR CHANCE AT VENGEANCE... IN THE RING. EVEN THOUGH THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION OF THE WORLD WAS STILL A FUGITIVE IN EUROPE, THERE WAS A NEW CROP OF WHITE HOPES NOW, DETERMINED TO RECLAIM THE TITLE IF THEY GOT THE CHANCE. THEY WERE NO BETTER THAN THE FIRST. HANDSOME GEORGE RODEL, POSSESSED OF SO WEAK A CHIN THAT HE EVENTUALLY BECAME KNOWN AS THE DIVING VENUS. GUNBOAT SMITH, WHO GOT HIS NAME FROM THE SIZE 15 SHOES HE WORE. AND THEN THERE WERE THE GIANTS. FRED FULTON, THE GIANT OF THE NORTH; JIM COFFEY, THE IRISH GIANT; CARL MORRIS, WHO BEGAN HIS CAREER AS THE SAPULPA GIANT, BUT ENDED IT AS THE SAPULPA BLEEDER. AND THEN, FROM POTTAWATOMIE, KANSAS, THERE WAS THE POTTAWATOMIE GIANT, JESS WILLARD. Man, as Jess: "GOD MADE ME A GIANT. "I NEVER RECEIVED AN EDUCATION, "NEVER HAD MONEY, "AND MY FOLKS, GOD BLESS THEM, NEVER HAD ANY MONEY. "I JUST SAT DOWN AND FIGURED OUT THAT A MAN AS BIG AS ME "OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO CASH IN ON HIS SIZE, AND THAT'S WHAT STARTED ME ON THE ROAD TO BOXING." ONE OF THE WHITE HOPES THAT CAME OUT OF THE JOHNSON-JEFFRIES FIGHT-- IN FACT, THE NEXT DAY AFTER THE JOHNSON-JEFFRIES FIGHT-- DOWN IN KANSAS, WAS A BIG RANCH HAND, 6'6" AND BIGGER. HE LOOKED LIKE THE MAN THAT JACK WOULD HAVE MET AT THE TOP OF THE BEANSTALK. AND JOHNSON'S ONLY COMMENT IS, "IF THEY MAKE WHITE HOPES ANY BIGGER, I'LL HAVE TO GET STILTS." Narrator: WILLARD MAY NOT HAVE BEEN THE BEST WHITE HOPE AVAILABLE, BUT AT 6'6" AND 250 POUNDS, HE WAS THE BIGGEST. THE ONE-TIME KANSAS COWBOY HAD TURNED TO THE FIGHT GAME AT 27, PURELY FOR THE MONEY. "I HATED IT," HE REMEMBERED. "HARMING THE OTHER FELLOW SEEMED TO BE CRUEL, "AND SO LONG AS THE OTHER FELLOW DIDN'T HARM ME MUCH, I DIDN'T SEE ANY REASON WHY I SHOULD HURT HIM." IF THE OTHER FELLOW DID HURT HIM, HOWEVER, WILLARD SOMETIMES GOT MAD, AND HE HAD A POWERFUL RIGHT HAND... POWERFUL ENOUGH TO HAVE KILLED ONE OPPONENT. IN LATE 1914, TWO AMBITIOUS PROMOTERS-- JACK CURLEY AND A YOUNG IMPRESARIO NAMED HARRY FRAZEE, WHO WOULD ONE DAY BUY THE BOSTON RED SOX AND SELL AWAY BABE RUTH TO THE NEW YORK YANKEES-- BEGAN WORKING TO ARRANGE A TITLE FIGHT BETWEEN JOHNSON AND JESS WILLARD. IT COULD NOT TAKE PLACE IN THE UNITED STATES. JOHNSON WAS SUBJECT TO ARREST THE MOMENT HE SET FOOT ON AMERICAN SOIL, BUT THEY WANTED IT TO BE AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO PULL IN AMERICAN FIGHT FANS EAGER TO SEE WILLARD DO WHAT JIM JEFFRIES HAD FAILED TO DO, DESTROY JACK JOHNSON. Roberts: INITIALLY, THE FIGHT WAS GOING TO BE IN MEXICO, BUT THEN IT'S MOVED TO HAVANA. HAVANA IS THE CARIBBEAN EQUIVALENT TO RENO. IT'S A GREAT PLACE FOR A FIGHT. Man, reading: "JESS WILLARD WOULD RESTORE THE WREATH "THAT JOHNSON RESTED FROM THE WHITES. "WITH WARLIKE ZEAL, HE GRINDS HIS TEETH, "THIS HERO OF AT LEAST TWO FIGHTS. "ALAS, OUR BOSOMS ARE NOT WARM WHEN SUCH A HERO GAMBLES IN. "UNLESS BLACK JACK IS CHLOROFORM, "WE DO NOT SEE HOW JESS CAN WIN. "THE CHANCES ARE HE'LL COME TO GRIEF "BEFORE THEY'RE FAIRLY DOWN TO BIZ, "FOR WHILE HE'S SURELY LONG ON BEEF, THE SPARK OF GENIUS ISN'T HIS." "NEW ORLEANS TIMES PICAYUNE." Narrator: WILLARD WAS GIVEN LITTLE CHANCE. BUT THE CHALLENGER WAS 27 YEARS OLD, A FULL DECADE YOUNGER THAN THE CHAMPION. HE TOOK TRAINING SERIOUSLY, SMASHED AT HIS SPARRING PARTNERS, GOT TO BED EARLY. "HE WAS IN SUPERB SHAPE," ONE WRITER NOTED, "AND HIS SKIN WAS DAZZLING IN ITS PURENESS." Man, reading: "NEW YORK HERALD." "JOHNSON IS NOT IN CONDITION. "HE HAS NOT TRAINED AS EXPERTS SAY HE SHOULD. "HE'S FAT TO THE POINT OF A PAUNCH. "HE APPEARS TO BREATHE HEAVILY AND WITH DIFFICULTY AFTER EVEN LIGHT EXERCISE." [NO AUDIO] Narrator: JOHNSON DID ONLY HALF THE ROADWORK HIS TRAINERS ASKED HIM TO DO, SPENT PRECIOUS SPARRING TIME GREETING FANS AND CLOWNING FOR THE CAMERAS. Sugar: NOW, THE PROMOTER KNOWS THAT THEORETICALLY JOHNSON WANTS TO MAKE A DEAL TO COME INTO THE U.S. THE WORD IS-- NEVER CONFIRMED-- THAT CURLEY TELLS HIM THAT, "YOU DO THIS FIGHT, FOR WHICH YOU'LL GET $35,000, "WE WILL MAKE AN ARRANGEMENT WITH THE U.S. AUTHORITIES. "THEY WILL DROP THE MANN ACT CONVICTION AND THE ONE YEAR PRISON SENTENCE." NEVER CONFIRMED, CURLEY DENIES IT, BUT THAT'S BEEN THE COMMON SCUTTLEBUTT EVER SINCE. Early: I THINK HE'S GOING INTO THE FIGHT CLEARLY ON THE LEVEL TO WIN THE FIGHT. WILLARD'S NOT A PARTICULARLY GOOD FIGHTER, AND JOHNSON SHOULD WIN. I DON'T THINK JOHNSON TOOK THE FIGHT VERY SERIOUSLY IN TRAINING VERY HARD FOR IT. BESIDES, HE'S 37 YEARS OLD BY NOW. HIS HUNGER FOR FIGHTING HAS DISSIPATED QUITE A BIT. HE'S NOT-- HE DOESN'T WANT TO FIGHT. IT HAPPENS WITH EVERY GREAT FIGHTER. "I DON'T REALLY WANT TO DO THIS ANYMORE. I'M TIRED OF THE TRAINING." JOHNSON'S NOT IN THE BEST CONDITION, BUT HE'S IN GOOD ENOUGH CONDITION THAT HE THINKS HE'S GOING TO WIN. AND HE WAS TELLING PEOPLE BEFORE THE FIGHT, "BET ON ME! I'M GOING TO WIN THIS FIGHT." Narrator: THE FIGHT WAS SCHEDULED FOR 45 ROUNDS. NEARLY 20,000 FANS WERE ON HAND. MANY HAD PURCHASED MINIATURE WHITE FLAGS TO SHOW THAT THEY IDENTIFIED WITH WILLARD. GUARDS ARMED WITH RIFLES AND MACHETES SURROUNDED THE RING TO MAKE SURE THERE WAS NO TROUBLE. IT WAS 12:30 IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN JOHNSON MADE HIS ENTRANCE. HE WAS UNCHARACTERISTICALLY SOLEMN. ONE OF HIS CORNERMEN POINTED OUT WHERE LUCILE WAS SITTING. THE MOSTLY WHITE CROWD ROARED WHEN WILLARD APPEARED. JOHNSON KNEW HE HAD TO GET TO THE YOUNGER MAN EARLY, AND AT FIRST IT SEEMED AS IF THIS FIGHT WOULD GO MORE OR LESS AS JOHNSON'S OTHER TITLE FIGHTS HAD GONE, WITH THE CHAMPION MAKING THE SLOW-MOVING CHALLENGER PAY FOR EVERY MISTAKE HE MADE. Sugar: HE TRIES FOR A KNOCK-OUT IN THE FIRST 8 ROUNDS AND THROWS EVERYTHING HE HAS AT WILLARD. WILLARD IS CUT, WILLARD IS RED, WILLARD IS BEATEN, BUT WILLARD DOESN'T MOVE A STEP. HE JUST TAKES EVERYTHING. AFTER THE EIGHTH ROUND, JOHNSON'S STRENGTH, STAMINA-- WHICH WAS ALWAYS GREAT-- BEGINS TO SEEP OUT. IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE SAND COMING OUT OF AN HOURGLASS. AND TOWARDS THE MIDDLE ROUND, ABOUT THE 15th, IT NOW BECOMES WILLARD WHO IS PUSHING FORWARD. WILLARD IS EXERTING HIS SIZE, HIS STRENGTH, AND HIS STAMINA TO NOW START PUSHING JOHNSON AROUND. Narrator: THE SUN BEGAN TO GET TO JOHNSON. THE TEMPERATURE AT RINGSIDE WAS 105 DEGREES. JOHNSON HAD WON NEARLY EVERY ROUND, BUT BY THE 20th HIS LEGS HAD GROWN WEARY. THE YOUNGER MAN STILL SEEMED FRESH. Sugar: IN THE 25th ROUND, WILLARD THROWS A WILD, SWINGING RIGHT HAND THAT HITS JOHNSON ABOVE THE HEART. NOT ONLY DOES WILLARD FEEL HIM GO LIMP, PEOPLE AT RINGSIDE CAN HEAR HIM LET HIS AIR OUT. IN THE CORNER, BETWEEN THE 25th AND 26th ROUNDS, JOHNSON SAYS TO ONE OF HIS CORNERMEN, "TELL MY WIFE I'M GETTING TIRED. WILL YOU PLEASE SEE THAT SHE GETS OUT OF HERE?" Man, reading: "JOHNSON LOOKED PITIFULLY TOWARD HIS WIFE. "HIS EXPRESSION WAS A HOPELESS ONE "OF DESPAIR AND HELPLESSNESS. "THAT THOSE WHO SAW IT WILL NEVER FORGET. "IT WAS AS THOUGH JOHNSON HAD CALLED ALOUD TO HIS WIFE, "THE END HAS COME. "THEY'VE BEEN CLAMORING FOR IT THESE LAST 5 YEARS. NOW THEY'VE GOT ME." Narrator: AT THE BELL FOR THE 26th ROUND, JOHNSON WAS SLOW LEAVING HIS CORNER. THE TWO MEN CIRCLED ONE ANOTHER. THEN WILLARD ATTACKED. A STRAIGHT RIGHT HAND STUNNED JOHNSON. HE CLUTCHED AT WILLARD, TRYING TO STAY UP, THEN SLID TO THE CANVAS. AS THE GLEEFUL CROWD STOOD AND CHEERED AND WAVED WHITE FLAGS TO SIGNAL THE WHITE MAN'S TRIUMPH THE REFEREE COUNTED TO 10. JACK JOHNSON HAD LOST THE TITLE. HE FOUGHT SO LONG AND HARD TO WIN, AND THEN TO KEEP. HIS ARMS INVOLUNTARILY CONVULSE AND THEY GO UP LIKE THIS. HE'S COUNTED OUT. HE COULD HAVE GOTTEN UP, WHICH LEADS AGAIN TO ANOTHER STORY-- THAT HE THREW THE FIGHT BECAUSE HE THREW HIS ARM OVER HIS EYES. AND YES, HE COULD HAVE GOTTEN UP, BUT ACCORDING TO THE REFEREE JACK WELSH, HE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN UP TO TAKE MORE DAMAGE. AND AS WELSH SAID, IF ANYTHING, JACK JOHNSON WAS A BUSINESSMAN, AND HE KNEW THIS WAS NOT HIS DAY. I THINK, IN MY MIND, HE WAS JUST OLD, OVERWEIGHT, UNTRAINED, AND IT WAS IT. TIME TO GO. Narrator: "JESS WILLARD," SAID A WRITER FOR THE "NEW YORK TIMES," "HAD RESTORED PUGILISTIC SUPREMACY TO THE WHITE RACE." Man, reading: "THE ETHIOPIAN HAS BEEN ELIMINATED. "THERE WILL NEVER BE A BLACK HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION, "OR A COLORED CHAMPION IN ANY DIVISION, FOR THAT MATTER, AT LEAST AS LONG AS THE PRESENT GENERATION ENDURES." Narrator: IT WOULD BE 7 YEARS BEFORE A BLACK MAN WAS ALLOWED TO FIGHT FOR ANY BOXING TITLE AGAIN, AND 15 MORE UNTIL A BLACK CHALLENGER GOT A SHOT AT THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP. Sugar: WILLARD WAS A NEW SAVIOR. NOBODY PRAISED HIM AS A FIGHTER, BUT THEY PRAISED HIM AS A SAVIOR OF THE WHITE RACE. JACK JOHNSON WAS WRITTEN OFF. HE BECAME A NON-PERSON AGAIN. AS HE HAD BEFORE HE WON IN 1908, NOW IN 1915 HE WAS A NON-PERSON. Man, as Johnson: "I HAVE NO COMPLAINT TO MAKE EXCEPT IN THIS: "WHILE I WAS CHAMPION, "I HAVE MADE A GREAT MANY ENEMIES, "MOST OF WHOM HATED ME FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN THAT I AM A NEGRO. "THESE PERSONS HAVE GOTTEN VINDICATION IN MY DEFEAT, AND I HOPE THE OBTAINED FULL ENJOYMENT OUT OF IT." Narrator: LATER, JOHNSON WOULD CLAIM HE HAD THROWN THE FIGHT. IT WASN'T TRUE, BUT BECAUSE THE FILMS OF THE HAVANA BOUT HAD ONLY RARELY BEEN SEEN IN THE UNITED STATES, AND IN THE FIGHT'S MOST CELEBRATED STILL IMAGE JOHNSON SEEMED TO BE SHADING HIS EYES FROM THE SUN, MILLIONS CAME TO BELIEVE IT. JESS WILLARD DID NOT. "IF JOHNSON THROWED THAT FIGHT," HE SAID, "I WISH HE'D THROWED IT SOONER. IT WAS HOTTER THAN HELL DOWN THERE." Man, as Johnson: "IN LOOKING BACK OVER THE YEARS OF MY TUMULTUOUS CAREER, "I'M ASTOUNDED WHEN I REALIZE THAT THERE ARE FEW MEN "IN ANY PERIOD OF THE WORLD'S HISTORY "WHO HAVE LEAD A MORE VARIED OR MORE INTENSE EXPERIENCE THAN I." Narrator: THE DAY AFTER HE LOST THE TITLE, JOHNSON APPLIED FOR A NEW PASSPORT, SAYING HE NOW WANTED TO RETURN TO THE UNITED STATES. SECRETARY OF STATE WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN REFUSED TO ISSUE HIM ONE. HE AND LUCILE MOVED ON TO ENGLAND, WHERE A VAUDEVILLE TOUR FAIRED POORLY, AND HE GOT IN TROUBLE AGAIN, THIS TIME FOR PUNCHING HIS THEATRICAL MANAGER IN THE EYE. THE HOME SECRETARY ORDERED HIM TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY. WITH MOST OF EUROPE STILL AT WAR, THE JOHNSONS FLED TO NEUTRAL SPAIN. WHEN AMERICA ENTERED THE WAR IN 1917, JOHNSON VOLUNTEERED TO SERVE WITH U.S. FORCES IN FRANCE, PROVIDED THE GOVERNMENT GAVE HIM A PARDON. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT REFUSED TO MAKE A DEAL, BUT FRENCH SOLDIERS HAD ALREADY NAMED A BIG ARTILLERY SHELL THAT GAVE OFF BLACK SMOKE "LE JACK JOHNSON." WHEN WORD REACHED HIM THAT HIS MOTHER HAD DIED IN CHICAGO, HE SENT A CHECK TO PAY FOR HER FUNERAL. BUT BECAUSE HE WAS STILL A FUGITIVE, HE WAS NOT ABLE TO ATTEND. HE WAS DRINKING STILL MORE HEAVILY NOW, AND WAS SHORT OF MONEY. AMERICAN AGENTS IN MADRID OVERHEARD HIM CURSING HIS COUNTRY FOR ITS TREATMENT OF HIM. HE AND LUCILE EVENTUALLY MOVED ON TO MEXICO. HE PRAISED IT AS A FREE COUNTRY, UNLIKE HIS OWN, AND URGED OTHER AFRICAN-AMERICANS TO JOIN HIM THERE. BUT AFTER NEARLY 7 YEARS IN EXILE, HE WANTED TO GO HOME. Man, as Johnson: "I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION "THAT ONE OF MY GREATEST ERRORS WAS MY FLIGHT TO EUROPE. "DURING THE YEARS IN WHICH I WAS A FUGITIVE, "NOTHING CAME INTO MY LIFE "IN THE WAY OF ADEQUATE COMPENSATION "FOR THE STINGS AND GRIEFS I SUFFERED FOR MY SEPARATION FROM MY FRIENDS AND RELATIVES." Narrator: IN THE SPRING OF 1920, JOHNSON APPROACHED THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. HE WOULD SURRENDER PEACEFULLY AND SERVE HIS TIME, HE SAID, BUT HE DID NOT WANT TO BE HANDCUFFED AND HE WANTED TO BE ESCORTED TO PRISON BY A BLACK OFFICER, NOT A WHITE ONE. THE BUREAU PROMISED ONLY THAT HE WOULD BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY. ON THE MORNING OF JULY 20, JACK JOHNSON STEPPED ACROSS THE MEXICAN BORDER AT TIJUANA INTO THE ARMS OF THE LAW. Man, as Johnson: "I WAS BACK ON AMERICAN SOIL, "AND THE REALIZATION THRILLED ME AS MUCH AS THOUGH "I WAS ENTERING THE REALMS OF A STRANGE AND UNEXPLORED LAND. "NEWSPAPERS ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES "BLAZONED FORTH THE NEWS THAT I HAD CROSSED THE BORDER "AND SURRENDERED. "ALL ALONG THE ROUTE, "RAILWAY STATIONS LARGE AND SMALL WERE JAMMED WITH CROWDS WAITING TO SEE ME." Narrator: 500 PEOPLE WERE THERE TO SEE HIM GET OFF THE TRAIN AT LEAVENWORTH, KANSAS. WHEN SOMEONE OFFERED TO DRIVE HIM TO THE FEDERAL PENITENTIARY, THE PRISONER INSISTED ON TAKING THE WHEEL. JACK JOHNSON WOULD DRIVE HIMSELF TO PRISON. HE GAVE HIS PROFESSION AS "PUGILIST/CHAUFFER." ASKED TO GIVE A FULL HISTORY OF THE CRIME FOR WHICH HE HAD BEEN SENT TO PRISON, HE WROTE ONLY, "IT IS ALLEGED THAT I VIOLATED THE MANN ACT, TO WHICH CHARGE I ENTERED A PLEA OF NOT GUILTY." THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PRISONS TURNED OUT TO BE AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE-- FORMER GOVERNOR DENVER DICKERSON OF NEVADA, THE POLITICIAN WHO HAD MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR JOHNSON TO FIGHT JEFFRIES BACK IN 1910. DICKERSON MADE JOHNSON A TRUSTEE, PUT HIM IN CHARGE OF PHYSICAL TRAINING FOR HIS FELLOW CONVICTS, AND EVEN ALLOWED HIM TO STAGE BOXING EXHIBITIONS. ON THANKSGIVING DAY, 1920, JOHNSON TOOK ON TWO CHALLENGERS, KNOCKING ONE DOWN 12 TIMES AND EASILY OUT-POINTING THE OTHER. EVEN IN PRISON, JACK JOHNSON REMAINED HIS OWN MAN. Man, reading: "JANUARY 21, "THIS PRISONER DOES NOT GET UP FOR THE A.M. COUNT. "THIS IS A DAILY OCCURRENCE, "AND HE SEEMS TO THINK THE GUARDS' ORDERS DO NOT APPLY TO HIM. "FEBRUARY 23, LOAFING IN MAIN HALL AND OFFICES. "HE COMES IN HALL WHEN READY, ASKS NO PERMISSION. "ALL BY HIMSELF, GOES WHERE HE PLEASES, ASKS NOBODY NO PERMISSION"-- OFFICER FOWLER. Man, as Johnson, "ON THE DAY I LEFT THE PRISON, "MANY CLOSE FRIENDS CAME TO MEET ME AT THE GATES. "THERE WAS A SORT OF GENERAL CELEBRATION, "THE EXTENT AND NATURE OF WHICH SURPRISED AND DISCONCERTED ME. "IF I HAD EVER FELT THAT MY LIFE HAD BEEN A FAILURE, "I CHANGED MY OPINION AND FOUND MYSELF REJOICING, EAGER, AND CONFIDENT. Narrator: JACK JOHNSON WAS RELEASED FROM LEAVENWORTH AT A LITTLE BEFORE 10:00 IN THE MORNING ON JULY 9, 1921. HE WAS 43 YEARS OLD. LUCILE WAS WAITING FOR HIM. HE TOLD REPORTERS THAT HE PLANNED TO ORDER A DOZEN SUITS FROM HIS FAVORITE TAILOR IN KANSAS CITY, AND HE WANTED A FIGHT WITH JACK DEMPSEY, THE FORMER HOBO WHO HAD TAKEN THE TITLE FROM JESS WILLARD. BUT DEMPSEY WOULD NOT FIGHT HIM OR ANY OTHER BLACK CHALLENGER, AND JOHNSON WAS FORCED TO TAKE MEANINGLESS FIGHTS IN MONTREAL AND HAVANA, NOGALES AND JUAREZ. HE WON THEM ALL, UNTIL EVEN HIS GREAT SKILLS GREW DULL. BOXERS, MORE THAN MOST ATHLETES, CAN HAVE GREAT POWERS OF DENIAL AND CAN'T FACE THE FACT THEIR SKILLS ARE ERODING, AND THEY CONTINUE TO FIGHT MUCH TOO LONG. AND JACK JOHNSON JUST KEPT GOING BECAUSE HE WAS USED TO A BIG LIFESTYLE. HE LIKED THE ATTENTION, AND HE KEPT HAVING ALL THESE FIGHTS. Narrator: AFTER MOST BOXERS' CAREERS WERE OVER, THEY HAD TO BE CONTENT WITH THE NOSTALGIC APPLAUSE THEIR NAMES EVOKED WHEN THEY WERE INTRODUCED FROM THE RING BEFORE A BIG FIGHT. NOT JACK JOHNSON. HE SOUGHT THE SPOTLIGHT TILL THE VERY END. HE RETURNED TO VAUDEVILLE, TRIED PREACHING, SPOKE OF WANTING TO PLAY "OTHELLO" ON BROADWAY. RAN A HARLEM NIGHTSPOT CALLED THE CAFE DELUXE UNTIL A SYNDICATE HEADED BY THE GANGSTER OWNEY MADDEN BOUGHT IT AND TURNED IT INTO THE COTTON CLUB. IN 1924, LUCILE DIVORCED HIM. THE UNCONTESTED GROUND WAS INFIDELITY. HE WAS REMARRIED THE FOLLOWING YEAR, TO A DIVORCEE HE HAD MET AT THE RACETRACK NAMED IRENE MARIE PINEAU. SHE WOULD REMAIN AT HIS SIDE TO THE END OF HIS LIFE. IN 1927, HE PUBLISHED HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY, IN WHICH HE STRUGGLED TO REDEEM HIS REPUTATION, TO RECAST HIMSELF AS THE MAN HIS MOST ARDENT ADMIRERS HAD WANTED HIM TO BE. HIS JACK JOHNSON NEVER TOLD A LIE AND RARELY LOST A FIGHT UNLESS HE WANTED TO. HE HAD TREATED ALL WOMEN WITH RESPECT AND THOUGHT IT BEST THAT YOUNG LADIES NOT BE PERMITTED TO GO TO NIGHTCLUBS. HE PREFERRED THE SPLENDID COMPOSITIONS OF THE OLD MASTERS TO WHAT HE DISMISSED AS "THE CLEVER SYNCOPATION OF JAZZ," AND URGED HIS READERS TO EAT MORE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. THE BOOK DID NOT SELL. BUT AS MEMORIES FADED, HIS REPUTATION DID IMPROVE. IN 1936, WHEN JOHNSON URGED BLACKS TO RE-ELECT FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT-- BECAUSE, HE SAID, "F.D.R. IS THE CHAMPION NOW, AND WEARS THE BELT"-- THE DEMOCRATS WERE HAPPY TO HAVE HIM ON THEIR SIDE. HE APPEARED AS AN ETHIOPIAN GENERAL IN A NEW YORK PRODUCTION OF "AIDA." HE STILL SOMETIMES FOUGHT EXHIBITIONS, AND OPPONENTS STILL FOUND IT HARD TO LAY A GLOVE ON HIM. WHEN AN ALABAMA SHARECROPPER'S SON NAMED JOE LOUIS BEGAN TO CLIMB THROUGH THE HEAVYWEIGHT RANKS THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY WIN THE YOUNG AFRICAN-AMERICAN THE TITLE 22 YEARS AFTER JOHNSON HAD LOST IT. THE OLD CHAMPION WAS NOT PLEASED. TO WIN WHITE APPROVAL, LOUIS' CAMP HAD PUBLICLY DECLARED THAT THERE MAN WAS DIFFERENT IN EVERY WAY FROM JACK JOHNSON. LOUIS WAS FORBIDDEN EVER TO ENTER A NIGHTCLUB ALONE, TO BE PHOTOGRAPHED WITH WHITE WOMEN, EVEN TO SMILE WHEN HE HAD BEATEN AN OPPONENT. JOHNSON WAS INSULTED. HE SAW EVERY KNOCK-OUT BY LOUIS AS A SLAP AT HIMSELF. Sugar: WHEN JOE LOUIS WAS EMERGING AS A CHAMPION-TO-BE, JACK JOHNSON OFFERED UP HIS SERVICES TO BE HIS TRAINER, AND HE WAS TURNED DOWN BY THE TWO BLACK MANAGERS OF JOE LOUIS BECAUSE HE EPITOMIZED EVERYTHING THEY DIDN'T WANT JOE LOUIS TO BE. JOE LOUIS WAS TRYING TO LIVE DOWN JACK JOHNSON. SO JOHNSON NOW LEAVES THE GYM IN CHICAGO, WHERE HE'S OFFERED HIS SERVICES BEFORE THE FIRST SCHMELING-LOUIS FIGHT, AND SELLS A STORY TO THE PAPERS THAT SCHMELING IS GOING TO WIN. HE NOT ONLY TELLS EVERYBODY THAT SCHMELING IS GOING TO WIN, HE TELLS THEM HOW SCHMELING IS GOING TO WIN. GUESS WHAT. HE WAS RIGHT. Narrator: "NEITHER LOUIS, NOR ANY OTHER FIGHTER OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION," JOHNSON SAID, "COULD EVER HAVE SURVIVED AGAINST JACK JOHNSON IN HIS PRIME." AND HE TOOK ENORMOUS PLEASURE IN THE FACT THAT NAT FLEISCHER, THE EDITOR OF "THE RING" MAGAZINE," WHO HAD SEEN THEM ALL FROM JIM CORBETT TO JOE LOUIS, AGREED. "JACK JOHNSON," FLEISCHER SAID, "WAS THE GREATEST HEAVYWEIGHT IN HISTORY." OFF AND ON FOR YEARS, HE HELD FORTH AT A SEEDY TIMES SQUARE CELLAR SIDESHOW CALLED HUBERT'S MUSEUM, PUNCHING A BAG, SIPPING RED WINE THROUGH A STRAW, AND TELLING TALL TALES ABOUT HIMSELF, AND HE CONTINUED TO DRIVE AS FAST AS HE LIKED. IN THE SPRING OF 1946, JOHNSON WAS RETURNING FROM A TANK TOWN TOUR OF EAST TEXAS WHERE HE HAD APPEARED AT MOVIE THEATERS AND COUNTY FAIRS HANDING OUT SOUVENIR CARDS AND SHAKING HANDS WITH CHILDREN AND WITH ALL THE OLD FIGHT FANS WHO REMEMBERED HIM. ON JUNE 10, HE AND A FRIEND NAMED FRED SCOTT, STOPPED AT A DINER JUST OUTSIDE OF RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA, "THEY TOLD US WE COULD EAT IN THE BACK OR NOT AT ALL," SCOTT REMEMBERED. "WE WERE HUNGRY, "AND THE FOOD HAD ALREADY BEEN SERVED, SO WE ATE. BUT BACK IN THE CAR, JACK REALLY GOT ANGRY." Narrator: JOHNSON TOOK THE WHEEL OF HIS LATEST HIGH-POWERED AUTOMOBILE, RACING NORTH ALONG HIGHWAY 1 AT BETTER THAN 70 MILES AN HOUR. HURTLING AROUND A SHARP CURVE NEAR THE LITTLE TOWN OF FRANKLINTON, HE LOST CONTROL. THE CAR SWERVED ACROSS THE WHITE LINE AND SLAMMED INTO A TELEPHONE POLE. FRED SCOTT WAS THROWN CLEAR AND SURVIVED. JACK JOHNSON DIED IN THE HOSPITAL A FEW HOURS LATER. HE WAS 68. HE WAS BURIED IN CHICAGO. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SURROUNDED THE PILGRIM BAPTIST CHURCH. 2,500 MOURNERS SAT INSIDE. HUNDREDS MORE FOLLOWED THE CASKET TO GRACELAND CEMETERY WHERE HE WAS BURIED NEXT TO ETTA DURYEA JOHNSON. Crouch: MY FATHER ONCE SAW JOHNSON, AND I COULD TELL FROM THE WAY MY FATHER SPOKE OF HIM THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN SOMETHING, BECAUSE MY FATHER WAS A CRIMINAL AND SO HE WAS SOMEWHAT CYNICAL ABOUT MANY THINGS. BUT WHEN HE STARTED TALKING ABOUT JACK JOHNSON, HE LIT UP IN A VERY UNUSUAL WAY AND TALKED ABOUT WHAT IT WAS LIKE GOING TO THIS GYM IN LOS ANGELES SOMETIME IN THE LATE THIRTIES OR EARLY FORTIES WHEN EVERYBODY WAS DOWN THERE TRYING TO LEARN HOW TO FIGHT. ONE DAY JACK JOHNSON CAME IN THE GYM. AND SO EVERYBODY STOPPED, BECAUSE JOE LOUIS WAS CHAMPION AT THAT TIME AND THERE WAS JACK JOHNSON STANDING THERE. AND MY FATHER, WHO WAS A REAL CLOTHESHORSE, I REMEMBER THAT HE TALKED ABOUT HOW BEAUTIFULLY DRESSED JOHNSON WAS. HE HAD THIS WALKING STICK THAT HE OBVIOUSLY HAD POLISHED, YOU KNOW, AND HE HAD THESE SHOES THAT WERE GLEAMING, AND THE WAY HIS HAT WAS TURNED A CERTAIN KIND OF WAY, SILK TIE, AND EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT. AND SO JOHNSON SAID TO THE GUY WHO RAN THE GYM, "BRING ME THE FASTEST GUY YOU GOT IN HERE." AND SO JOHNSON GOT IN THE RING. AND HE JUST TOOK THESE GLOVES, AND HE STOOD THERE IN ONE POSITION AND HE JUST MOVED HIS HANDS... AND THE GUY COULDN'T HIT HIM. AND SO AFTER THE KID GOT EXHAUSTED, JOHNSON TOOK THE GLOVES OFF AND THREW THEM DOWN AND ADDRESSED THE REST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE GYM, SAYING THAT, "YOU'VE NOW SEEN SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT TO SEE." HE SAID, "I WAS A BRUNETTE IN A BLONDE TOWN, BUT GENTLEMEN, I DID NOT STOP STEPPING." AND HE TOOK HIS STUFF AND LEFT. IT SORT OF WAS LIKE A MAGIC THING. SO, IT'S LIKE, HERE WAS THIS LEGENDARY GUY, AND THEN HE PERFORMED THIS MAGICAL ACT, AND THEN HE LEFT, LEGEND INTACT. Man: WELL, I'D PUT HIM FIRST, BUT HE WAS AN ARTIST, AND ARTISTS LEAVE ARTISTIC THINGS BEHIND, AND THE MEMORIES OF JACK JOHNSON ARE MEMORIES OF ART. Jones: I THINK THE MAN WAS ABOUT MOVEMENT... NOT JUST THE MOVEMENT IN THE RING, WHICH HE WAS A BALLET MASTER AT, BUT MOVEMENT AND MIGHT. "DON'T PIN ME DOWN. "DON'T LOCK ME UP. "DON'T EMBRACE ME TO DEATH. DON'T USE ME AS YOU." I DON'T SEE HIS LIFE AS A TRAGEDY, EITHER. THE SCENE WAS A TRAGEDY, AMERICA WAS A TRAGEDY. IT COULDN'T COPE WITH HIM. AND I'D SAY TO A LESSER DEGREE, AMERICA WAS A TRAGEDY IN TERMS OF RACE AND RACISM, AND WE'RE STILL FIGHTING ABOUT THAT. WE'RE STILL TRYING TO GET OVER THAT LITTLE PIMPLE IN OUR PSYCHE. Newfield: I BELIEVE IT WAS IN THE SUMMER OF 1968, I WAS WRITING A PROFILE OF MUHAMMAD ALI AND HE CAME TO NEW YORK. THIS WAS DURING HIS EXILE-- HIS LICENSE IS REVOKED, HIS PASSPORT IS SEIZED, HE CAN'T GET A FIGHT ANYWHERE-- AND HE GOES TO SEE "THE GREAT WHITE HOPE" ON BROADWAY, WITH JAMES EARL JONES PLAYING JACK JOHNSON IN A SPECTACULAR, PRIZE-WINNING PLAY. AND I REMEMBER HOW AFFECTED ALI WAS BY THE PLAY. THERE WERE OBVIOUS PARALLELS. HE'S BEING PROSECUTED, JACK JOHNSON HAD BEEN PROSECUTED. HE'S REVILED BY A SEGMENT OF WHITE SOCIETY. JACK JOHNSON WAS REVILED BY ALMOST ALL OF WHITE SOCIETY. THEY'RE BOTH EXTROVERTS. THEY BOTH HAVE EXTRAORDINARY PERSONALITIES. AND I REMEMBER ALI COMING OUT OF THE PLAY AND A LOT OF TV CAMERAS WERE THERE. AND I REMEMBER HIM SAYING, "I TOTALLY IDENTIFY WITH JACK JOHNSON. Jones: WHEN MUHAMMAD ALI CAME TO SEE THE PLAY, HE CAME BACKSTAGE AND HE SAID, "THAT'S MY STORY." HE SAID, "YOU TAKE OUT THE ISSUE OF THE WHITE WOMEN "AND REPLACE THAT WITH THE ISSUE OF RELIGION, THAT'S MY STORY." HE KEPT COMING BACK. HE KEPT BRINGING PEOPLE BACK TO SEE THE PLAY. "THAT'S MY STORY." I REMEMBER, BUNDINI BROWN, WHO WAS MUHAMMAD ALI'S CORNERMAN, JUST BEFORE MUHAMMAD ALI-- OR PERHAPS EVEN IN THE START OF A FIGHT, HE WOULD SAY, "GHOST IN THE HOUSE! "GHOST IN THE HOUSE! "JACK JOHNSON'S HERE! GHOST IN THE HOUSE!" AND HE SORT OF OVERRIDES BOXING, AND, INDEED, THE WHOLE CULTURE THAT SURROUNDS IT LIKE SOME SORT OF A GHOST. A GHOST IN THE HOUSE. Crouch: I WOULD SAY IN HIS WAY, ON A FAR LOWER SCALE, JOHNSON IS THERE WITH PEOPLE LIKE LINCOLN, THOMAS EDISON, DUKE ELLINGTON, LOUIS ARMSTRONG. THEY'RE JUST HOMEMADE GUYS, THESE GUYS WHO YOU COULDN'T FIGURE OUT, THAT THERE'S NO RECIPE FOR. HE'S ONE OF THEM. AND HE'S THE KIND OF A PERSON WHO COULD HAVE ONLY HAVE TAKEN-- WHO COULD HAVE ONLY COME ABOUT IN THE UNITED STATES, BECAUSE AMERICA, FOR WHATEVER ITS PROBLEMS, STILL HAS A CERTAIN KIND OF ELASTICITY AND A CERTAIN LATITUDE THAT ALLOWS THE PERSON TO DREAM A BIG ENOUGH DREAM THAT CAN BE ACHIEVED IF THE PERSON IS AS BIG AS THE DREAM.
